391709,AZSN1TO0JI87B,6303954197,A. Estes,"[6, 6]","Fun but dumb, ""House II: The Second Story"" is an altogether different tale than that of the original ""House,"" starring William Katt. In the second installment, a yuppie couple (Arye Gross and Lar Park Lincoln) inherit a mansion, only to discover an alternate universe inside. Hijinks ensue when the lucky owner reunites with his undead great-great-grandfather and, along with his goofy buddy, battles baby pterodactyls, angry outlaws and Bill Maher.Although a character in ""Scream 2"" cites the film as a superior sequel, ""House II"" does little to one-up its predecessor. Taking on a much lighter tone and with little to no violence, this sequel is more like a campy spoof of the first film, which in and of itself was a silly affair. No worries, though, as once you know what to expect, you can have a good time with the film. The performances across the board are light-hearted and fun, with plenty of lovable goofballs to go around (a sequel concerning these characters would be a good time). The score by Harry Manfredini is most memorable, as you'll be humming the film's main theme not long after the credits have rolled.Writer/director Ethan Wiley may not have created much of a horror film, but his blend of the supernatural and absurd with a hint of Western makes for a winning recipe that just can't be matched. Those expecting bloodshed and jump-scares will be left in the cold, but perhaps with a few drinks in hand and with the right expectations, you'll find ""House II: The Second Story"" a film deserving of the title ""cult classic.""",4,I Drank With a Zombie (3.5 stars),1295827200,"01 24, 2011",2011,1546,"['Fun', 'dumb', 'House', 'II', 'Second', 'Story', 'altogether', 'different', 'tale', 'original', 'House', 'starring', 'William', 'Katt', 'second', 'installment', 'yuppie', 'couple', 'Arye', 'Gross', 'Lar', 'Park', 'Lincoln', 'inherit', 'mansion', 'only', 'discover', 'alternate', 'universe', 'inside', 'Hijinks', 'ensue', 'when', 'lucky', 'owner', 'reunites', 'undead', 'great-great-grandfather', 'goofy', 'buddy', 'baby', 'pterodactyls', 'angry', 'outlaws', 'Bill', 'Maher.Although', 'character', 'Scream', '2', 'film', 'superior', 'sequel', 'House', 'II', 'little', 'one-up', 'predecessor', 'Taking', 'much', 'lighter', 'tone', 'little', 'violence', 'sequel', 'more', 'campy', 'spoof', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'silly', 'affair', 'worries', 'though', 'once', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'can', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'film', 'performances', 'board', 'are', 'light-hearted', 'fun', 'plenty', 'lovable', 'goofballs', 'go', 'around', 'sequel', 'concerning', 'characters', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'time', 'score', 'Harry', 'Manfredini', 'most', 'memorable', ""'ll"", 'be', 'humming', 'film', 'main', 'theme', 'not', 'long', 'credits', 'have', 'rolled.Writer/director', 'Ethan', 'Wiley', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'created', 'much', 'horror', 'film', 'blend', 'supernatural', 'absurd', 'hint', 'Western', 'winning', 'recipe', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'matched', 'expecting', 'bloodshed', 'jump-scares', 'will', 'be', 'left', 'cold', 'perhaps', 'few', 'drinks', 'hand', 'right', 'expectations', ""'ll"", 'find', 'House', 'II', 'Second', 'Story', 'film', 'deserving', 'title', 'cult', 'classic']",House II: The Second Story VHS

Although there is a lot of cult feel about the film, I thought the cast was decent for what it was worth. For some weird reason as I saw it in the 80s, I thought the lead character was Mark Linn-Baker who played Larry Appleton from the TV show Perfect Strangers. I must admit that the ending was extremely odd to me. It was like this: Jesse sees the ethnic woman of his dreams on the top with Charlie in the back of the wagon along with a mutant caterpillar dog, and Charlie gives this weird, moronic smile. And then Jesse thinks to himself that he has found his family, and they all settle in the West in the middle of 19th century. Too lame. At least I thought the arch-villain looked very sinister. But it was dumb to see that Jesse was shown to have the pick-up ""skill"" to duel with him. That's impossible. Notice how Charlie would fall off drunk from his car by the back? Something like that in real life would have gotten him a brain damage by a traumatic blow in the base area. I never understood why it was so important to keep Gramps alive because he is like...175 years old already. Jeez, he lived too long to outlast his usefulness. At least I liked how the skull looked like.

The adventure takes off in HOUSE 2, the sequel to Steve Miner's surprise hit from 1986. The second story is much different than the first, but with many returning artists (including cinematographer Mac Ahlberg and producer Sean S. Cunningham), it provides an entertaining continuation with the same style and light comic mood of the series. Although it downplays the horror here in the sequel, HOUSE 2 opens its doors to a thrilling world of fantasy, one that takes us from the land before time to the temples of ancient Mexico, and on to the Wild West! It is here that Jesse and his friend Charlie must battle everything from pterodactyls to undead gunmen in a struggle to rescue the skull and use its magic powers to keep the corpse of his great great grandfather alive!

And I seen the original Critters on the big screen, as my uncle demanded that the movie was funny, but mom and grandma had a different opinion after taking my aunt and me to see it. Anyway, I have fond memories of House II, despite it being less creepy than the first one.

391721,A319SKSB556033,6303954197,"Inspector Gadget ""Go Go Gadget Reviews""","[36, 42]","This non-related sequel is so sweet-natured, so tame and family orientated that to assume otherwise is completely ludicrous. There is nothing in this movie that could possibly rate it above a PG, max. I wouldn't even have reservations letting younger children watch House 2.A new house has a 20-something yuppie called Jesse (Arye Gross) move in with his girlfriend Kate (Lar Park-Lincoln). His friend Charlie (Jonathan Stark), a music agent, arrives with his new diva discovery Jana (Amy Yasbeck) to help him thru the unfamiliar first few days. The house is where Jesse's parents were killed when he was just a baby and it full of many curiosities.Crafted in a bizarre gothic-Aztec style the house itself is a marvellous set and the many rooms and passages are as mysterious to us as they are to Jesse. Sitting on one of his many mantelpieces is a crystal skull that fascinates him for some reason. He even misses his housewarming party while studying the skull's history.His studies lead him to dig up the grave of his great, great grandfather, or Gramps (Royal Dano), where he discovers the old coot isn't dead just in limbo. The person who possesses the skull is granted eternal youth but it also warps the space-time continuum within the House.Gramps comes home with Jesse, is more enthralled by Kleenex boxes and TV than the mysteries around him and ducks for cover whenever someone from another time comes to steal the skull. Just like the first movie different rooms lead into different time zones. Jesse and Charlie have many hilarious adventures battling caveman, dinosaurs, Aztecs an evil cowboy called Slim. The one that killed Jesse's parents and betrayed Gramps over a century ago.House 2 has so much careless abandon and zany plot twists that it is totally impossible not to love this movie. The huge success of the first movie meant that this one was put into production literally and hour later and Ethan Wiley was given the budget and green light to do whatever he wanted. How often does happen today? Usually it would make for a bad movie considering this was the first movie Wiley directed. But it makes for an unusually cute and light-hearted supernatural romp.One of the weaker aspects of this sequel is that it has more SFX and animation by Phil Tippet's stop-motion workshop and less by Dreamquest. The matte paintings are gorgeous but the dated dinosaurs look hokey in a few shots. If you can just squint during these moments you won't notice.Bill Maher from TV's ""Politically Incorrect"" even manages to show up as a music producer who is interested in Yasbeck and mighty suspicious of Jesse's antics. John Ratzenberger (this makes both movies star one of the ""Cheers"" barflies) appears as a repairman/adventurer who assists Jesse and Charlie battle some Aztecs. Look out for Kane Hodder (Jason) in an ape costume. Jesse adopts a fluffy, little baby pterodactyl and a strange creature called a Caterpuppy, a cross between...well you know. You need an open mind and a suspension of disbelief to swallow the outrageous goings on in this movie.The commentary is better than the one on the first movie. Ethan Wiley and Cunningham get on well and have no quibbles pointing out how crazy the film is. They discuss the budget, tell tales of the late Royal Dano and explain how many of the effects were pulled off within the constraints of the budget. One of the most interesting things they mention is that even tho the movie was stuck in between The Color Purple and Beverly Hills Cop II the kids still preferred House 2 as their fave movie of the summer. But because the movie didn't have it's own opening weekend, unlike the original, it wasn't as successful. Didn't stop 2 more sequels being made. A theatrical trailer is also included.Much like the first film the picture has been brilliantly transferred onto DVD. The 1.85:1 anamorphic picture looks super with very few glitches. Colors are rendered with pleasant accuracy and you wouldn't believe the low-budget origins when judging this picture.

It isn't a classic or a masterpiece either. With that being said, it is strange, crazy, outlandish, interesting, and very laughable and stupid at times. Frankly, it's just good enough if there's absolutely nothing else to watch, and you need to waste some time, you've come to the right place. There's nothing really memorable about it. I've watched this movie several times, and now that I think of it, every single time, I've had nothing better to do. However, I do think it was way better than the first ""House"" with William Katt though. I know that comment leaves a lot to be desired for the viewers who had the misfortune of seeing the first film. Let's not forget, the extremely chessy special effects. I will give them brownie points for doing the best they could do with the budget, but I can probably guarantee that the same guys did the special effects for both films. I don't know if ths movie can be classed up as horror, but more of a spoof or a dark comedy so to speak. I will tell you that this is the first and last time that you will see most of the faces in this movie.

A very special house which will plunge him into an incredible adventure...one where all of his dreams, fantasies and nightmares will be realized where he meets his 175-year-old great-great grandfather(Royal Dano), encounter a giant barbarian, confront a pterodactyl, discover a crystal skull with magical life-restoring powers and more & he'll be thrust into a life-and-death struggle, encountering things guaranteed to horrify and delight - all without ever leaving this house.The film concludes with the revelation that Jesse used the crystal skull to travel back to the Old West marking Gramps new grave.Unfortunately, HOUSE 2 didn't do too well at the box office when it came out in theatres in the Spring of 1987, especially since HOUSE II ignores the storyline & characters from its predecessor in favor of a new supernatural comedy, so the action & violence was toned down much lighter than the original HOUSE, which was theatrically released in the Winter of 1986 & was a lot more significant than the sequel was, despite the fact that HOUSE II still took place in the same house where Jesse's predecessor Roger Cobb(Bill Katt)and his aunt had their ordeals.",3,A downgrade from its predecessor,1386633600,"12 10, 2013",2013,1391,"['HOUSE', '2-THE', 'SECOND', 'STORY', 'talented', 'artist', 'growing', 'career', 'Jesse', 'McLaughlin', 'Arye', 'Gross', 'sitting', 'top', 'world', 'beautiful', 'girlfriend', 'Kate', 'Lar', 'Park', 'Lincoln', 'moving', 'magnificent', 'house', 'very', 'special', 'house', 'will', 'plunge', 'incredible', 'adventure', 'one', 'where', 'dreams', 'fantasies', 'nightmares', 'will', 'be', 'realized', 'where', '175-year-old', 'great-great', 'grandfather', 'Royal', 'Dano', 'encounter', 'giant', 'barbarian', 'confront', 'pterodactyl', 'discover', 'crystal', 'skull', 'magical', 'life-restoring', 'powers', 'more', ""'ll"", 'be', 'thrust', 'life-and-death', 'struggle', 'encountering', 'things', 'guaranteed', 'horrify', 'delight', 'ever', 'leaving', 'house.The', 'film', 'revelation', 'Jesse', 'used', 'crystal', 'skull', 'travel', 'back', 'Old', 'West', 'marking', 'Gramps', 'new', 'grave.Unfortunately', 'HOUSE', '2', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'too', 'well', 'box', 'office', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'theatres', 'Spring', '1987', 'especially', 'HOUSE', 'II', 'storyline', 'characters', 'predecessor', 'favor', 'new', 'supernatural', 'comedy', 'action', 'violence', 'was', 'toned', 'down', 'much', 'lighter', 'original', 'HOUSE', 'was', 'theatrically', 'released', 'Winter', '1986', 'was', 'lot', 'more', 'significant', 'sequel', 'was', 'fact', 'HOUSE', 'II', 'still', 'took', 'place', 'same', 'house', 'where', 'Jesse', 'predecessor', 'Roger', 'Cobb', 'Bill', 'Katt', 'aunt', 'had', 'ordeals']",House II: The Second Story VHS
