Fred Savage, who was on top of the world at the time, was obviously a great pick for the main character. Beau Bridges and Christian Slater took the movie to an even higher level of meaningfulness and laughter with their performances...The movie is full of great comedy that suits all ages, and a heart-warming story of a divided family trying to come together. I dont think there is an age group even 12 years later that this movie wont appeal to, which makes it a timeless classic for me and a great purchase idea for everyone...wherever you may find this rare film that is.

Unluckily, my old NES broke down in 1992 :(  I still remember playing games for my NES.The Movie is pretty good, although it has a thin plot.  Jimmy Woods (Luke Edwards) is mentally handicapped and Corey (Fred Savage) fears Jimmy will be put into a home.  Corey and Jimmy run away via a Hostess truck.  Haley (Jenny Lewis) soon joins the group and notices Jimmy has a knack for video games.  With that said, all three head to a video game contest in Los Angeles.

Speaking of bad, I had to see the movie for the most infamous moment where Lucas uttered the corny line (still famous to this day for all the wrong reasons) which became ironically true: ""I love the Power Glove. It's so bad."" Indeed, yes...The Power Glove was so bad that it was entirely unworkable. Anyway, the film...*shakes my head* where to begin? Starting with the idea of running away from Utah to California, no kid this young would have done it. Looking at the three kids trying to hitchhike, I was seeing possible victims of child sex abuse. Fred Savage displayed awful acting galore in The Wizard, and it was all cringeworthy. Christine Phillips and Luke Edwards were as bad as him. The movie was filled with so many cheesy moments that I was ready to see cheese to pour out of my DVD player. Why was Fred lugging that half ton skateboard around with him? I mean, was there really a use for it during the hitchhiking trip? And he brought a lot of useless crap with him too including that cheap fake army canteen. Poor Jimmy, did everybody realize that he has autism? I couldn't believe the diagnostician didn't spot it. Oh...that happy ending...see how video games brought the family together? I am in tears...NOT. Right now, I am debating if Spanky is dumber than Jimmy. I remember watching the movie back then in theatres and how it was the first time Super Mario Bros 3, which was an overrated game back then, got unveiled. Today, it's a...very underwhelming game. That host of Video Armageddon was certainly on drugs...probably crack cocaine. Anyway, the entire film was meant to be a one huge Nintendo commercial, and it didn't work that well. I mean, the boy was saying, ""California..."" Then, the next thing I know, we are in Waldo's World in a land of huge fake dinosaurs. Time to put the boy in an institution. Please, throw Fred the Baby in there too. What was Christian Slater thinking? He was wasted in his role. Should have been a vampire in another film. All in all, The Wizard was a waste of time because it was a tug-of-war between Jimmy's mental problems and Nintendo product placements.",1,Help! Help!

E Jackson,"[0, 0]","The truth is, I only watched the Wizard last night because a few months ago I found out it shows footage of Super Mario Bros. 3 just before the games release in the United States.  Really unfortunate that I wasn't able to see the Wizard when it was brand new and my fellow video gamers were obsessing over it.  I believe my gaming obsession got underway in 1989 when this movie just came out and back then would have been a PERFECT opportunity to watch it.  Oh well.  I had no idea of its existence at the time, however (despite being a big Fred Savage fan thanks to the Wonder Years).Anyway, all the games you see featured in the movie are ones that most of us at the time have played before.  Double Dragon, Rad Racer, the Little Mermaid, the American version of Super Mario Bros. 2... these are all games that I've played countless times (and would go on to have better sequels in my opinion).Anyway, why only the 3-star rating?  It's honestly not much of a movie.  Average at best.  Fred Savage's character has a friend who's a wizard with video games- completely unstoppable with a controller in his hands and awaiting the chance to compete with other experienced video gamers.  So when it's discovered they don't have enough money to travel to their destination, these two meet up with a girl and basically hitchhike out in the desert to the video game competition.  Along the way they find themselves mingling with other kids who happen to be better at video games than the wizard himself.  The one kid who takes out the mighty power glove is pretty funny.  You see back then we really *did* think that thing was powerful!So... guess what game it is that makes up the final round of the competition?  Yup, you probably guessed correctly- the one, the only, the legendary... Super Mario Bros. 3!  Supposely this movie helped play a part in exciting video gamers even MORE over the release of this game.  The hype for it was really huge in the late 80's and now we know why- SMB3 has become the best NES game of all-time, and maybe even in the top 5 games ever made.  So yeah, this is sort of a big deal.It must have been awesome to watch the Wizard as a youngster while anticipating the release of SMB3.  Actually it's hard to believe there was a time when this game wasn't yet a part of our American lives!  I recommend skipping to the end of the movie for the 3-minute segment showing SMB3 and ignore all the other unmemorable bits that make up the rest of the movie.  It doesn't really tell an enticing storyline.",3,a wizard in the desert,1358899200,"01 23, 2013",2013,2522,"['truth', 'only', 'watched', 'Wizard', 'last', 'night', 'few', 'months', 'found', 'footage', 'Super', 'Mario', 'Bros.', '3', 'just', 'games', 'release', 'United', 'States', 'Really', 'unfortunate', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'see', 'Wizard', 'when', 'was', 'brand', 'new', 'fellow', 'video', 'gamers', 'were', 'obsessing', 'believe', 'gaming', 'obsession', 'got', 'underway', '1989', 'when', 'movie', 'just', 'came', 'out', 'back', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'PERFECT', 'opportunity', 'watch', 'Oh', 'well', 'had', 'idea', 'existence', 'time', 'however', 'being', 'big', 'Fred', 'Savage', 'fan', 'thanks', 'Wonder', 'Years', '.Anyway', 'games', 'see', 'featured', 'movie', 'are', 'ones', 'most', 'time', 'have', 'played', 'Double', 'Dragon', 'Rad', 'Racer', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'American', 'version', 'Super', 'Mario', 'Bros.', '2', 'are', 'games', ""'ve"", 'played', 'countless', 'times', 'would', 'go', 'have', 'better', 'sequels', 'opinion', '.Anyway', 'why', 'only', '3-star', 'rating', 'honestly', 'not', 'much', 'movie', 'Average', 'best', 'Fred', 'Savage', 'character', 'friend', 'who', 'wizard', 'video', 'games-', 'completely', 'unstoppable', 'controller', 'hands', 'awaiting', 'chance', 'compete', 'other', 'experienced', 'video', 'gamers', 'So', 'when', 'discovered', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'money', 'travel', 'destination', 'two', 'meet', 'up', 'girl', 'basically', 'hitchhike', 'out', 'desert', 'video', 'game', 'competition', 'way', 'find', 'mingling', 'other', 'kids', 'who', 'happen', 'be', 'better', 'video', 'games', 'wizard', 'one', 'kid', 'who', 'out', 'mighty', 'power', 'glove', 'pretty', 'funny', 'see', 'back', 'then', 'really', '*did*', 'think', 'thing', 'was', 'powerful', 'So', 'guess', 'what', 'game', 'up', 'final', 'round', 'competition', 'Yup', 'probably', 'guessed', 'correctly-', 'one', 'only', 'legendary', 'Super', 'Mario', 'Bros.', '3', 'Supposely', 'movie', 'helped', 'play', 'part', 'exciting', 'video', 'gamers', 'even', 'MORE', 'release', 'game', 'hype', 'was', 'really', 'huge', 'late', '80', 'now', 'know', 'why-', 'SMB3', 'become', 'best', 'NES', 'game', 'all-time', 'maybe', 'even', 'top', '5', 'games', 'ever', 'made', 'So', 'yeah', 'sort', 'big', 'deal.It', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'awesome', 'watch', 'Wizard', 'youngster', 'anticipating', 'release', 'SMB3', 'Actually', 'hard', 'believe', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'game', 'was', ""n't"", 'yet', 'part', 'American', 'recommend', 'skipping', 'end', 'movie', '3-minute', 'segment', 'showing', 'SMB3', 'ignore', 'other', 'unmemorable', 'bits', 'make', 'up', 'rest', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'tell', 'enticing', 'storyline']",The Wizard VHS

It is, instead, a movie about Fred Savage, his goofy little challenged brother, and an awesome Nintendo championship.This movie pits David against Goliath, in an Orwellian-like fantasyland with Power Gloves, road trips, and the comic stylings of Beau Bridges.  But at its heart, this movie is about brotherly love and how fun is it that Fred Savage (who we all adored as the lil' brother on The Wonder Years Show) now gets to turn the tables and be the older brother.  Now that is some acting!As his goofy little brother pines away for California, you'll be pining away for more gritty and romp-filled scenes, and you will get them in spades!  This is not just a movie about Nintendo, but really about the triumph of the human spirit (over Luigi and Princess Toadstool).They have made many movies about Nintendo championships, but this one puts it in a historical context that in no way feels dated today.

Long lines out the door in the hopes to get one of the latest generation video game systems or the various games that are available on said system.Back in 1989, things weren't too differnet. The graphics may not have been up to today's standards but there was one king on the block that everyone had to know. That was Nintendo. The 8-bit Nintendo Entertainment System was a must have for kids young and old alike. With games varying from sports, action and adventure this was the must have system of the late 1980's and early 1990's.This movie, pretty much takes a look at life when focused on a young boy, Jimmy and his natural talent dealing with  the Nintendo Entertainment System. He is a natural wiz at any and all games, yet doesn't speak much except for exclaiming his desire to go to ""California"". Fred Savage as Corey, sets out on an adventure with his half brother Jimmy in what seems like a quest to California to compete in the Video Game Championships at Universal Studios.Along the way they meet up with Haley, played by Jenny Lewis, who becomes their female compainon in their quest to reach California and get out of trouble that they happen to get into as they avoid the parents and the bounty hunter who are all after the boys who left without permission on this quest to reach the video game tournement.The movie has a very 1980's feel to it. It comes off as an advertisement of sorts for all things Nintendo. You have the use of the ill fated ""Power Glove"" that one of the kids rivals who will be at said tournement uses while they challenge him in his home town on the way to California. There is even a point where Haley is on the phone with the ""Nintendo Game Councelors"" getting much needed help on every and any game for the NES. Of course not telling us watchers of this movie how much that really would have costs as most people knew it was not a free service as they were showing in the movie.  Also while on the phone the names of various popular games are being mentioned left and right, a lot of the games not possibly ever going to be used in the tournament as they are RPG in nature. There was even one point where Corey's father and brother (played by Beau Bridges and Christian Slater) have to get their car fixed and pop out a NES to play on a small TV in the repair garage. It was moments like this that dumbed down the movie a bit. What could have been great, really comes off as a dated commercial for how wonderful the NES is and how even adults use it and get a kick out of it.The biggest and probably main draw of the movie, was the fact that it proudly displayed a long awaited game at this time ""Super Mario Bros 3"" which was not even out in game stores at the time this movie was in theaters. I won't give away the details surrounding the use of this game, but it was a real reason that people ran out to see this movie. As the Super Mario craze was alive and well at this time and just for the sight of  the next edition of the long running Mario saga, was a reason that most Nintendo fans had to see this film. Yours truly included. That thrill of seeing the game used in this movie is probably not as big a deal now with the game already out for so many years and in differnet editions but if you can take yourself back to this time period and put the advertisement factors aside, you will see why this is a cool moment in the film.Advertisements aside, the movie is a blast to watch again. It comes off as a great piece of pure nostalgia. Remembering a time when things were easy and simplistic yet still fun. A lot of people who were in their teen's when this movie came out all probably wished that they were stars in such things as a video game competition. This movie really plays up on the idea of going cross country just to prove one's worth in said tourny, but also shows that the kids who were the focus, were more then just video game crazed kids wanting to show off their skills. We learn towards the end that there really was other goals then just video games behind the whole film. So what turns out to be a kid just wanting to win a video game championship turns out to be about much more. Again not the deepest of moments but at least they did try to make the story more then just being to play video games and nothing else.Over all, this film comes off as a weird mixture of ""Over the Top"", ""The Fugitive"" and ""The Goonies"" sponsored by Nintendo. It should also be noted that Universal who made this film, decides to get in on the advertising in the movie as well of their own brand, proudly showing various characters and locations in Universal Studios, California where the tournament takes place. Once you get past all the ads within, you will find a fun and enjoyable film that I think all in the family should enjoy. It's not the most creative or deepest of stories ever seen in a movie, but it is fun and you start to root for the kids and get involved in the situation you find yourself in as if you too were on a similar quest to just accomplish something and to have your parents understand what you are going through.It's a fun watch and a great trip down memory lane. The NES may be a memory now, but this is one trip down memory lane you won't be sorry getting. And of course like most 1980's movies, everything works out happily ever after in this story, and we wouldn't have it any other way. Check it out. If you haven't seen it, it will be a new and great experience, especially if you were a kid growing up in the 1980's and if you did see it, see it again as this is one of those hidden treasures that you will be glad to see after not having seen it in so long.",4,Good blast from the past that whole family can enjoy,1170288000,"02 1, 2007",2007,5736,"['Now', 'days', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'anywhere',

It felt like it was really made for my generation, those of us who grew up on 80's music and Nintendo games.  Beyond that, it's basically every kid's fantasy adventure.  A wild road trip across the land with no adults telling you what to do or where to go, all for the sake of getting rich by playing Nintendo.  What child could ever ask for more?But it also deals with some very serious issues, such as broken up families, mental illness, and personal loss.  On top of that, the music is great, the games are geat, and the setting is great.  These are some key reasons it still holds up well even by today's standards, and every time I turn this on, I'm in nostalgia heaven.Now of course this does require some suspension of disbelief, mainly because these kids manage to travel hundreds of miles across multiple states by hitching rides with strangers who never once question why they are traveling with no parents.  But who cares?  It's still a blast that can be enjoyed by people of all ages.

It is esentially a full-length Nintendo commercial but it's so much fun. Fresh-faced Fred Savage is Corey, the brother of Jimmy, a painfully-quiet kid who is secretly a Nintendo prodigy. When Corey learns that Jimmy may get taken to a home for kids with special needs, he kidnaps his brother and the two go on an adventure to California. Of course, they come across the evil goon that their mother has hired to bring them back and countless thugs who don't like losing their hard-earned money in a Nintendo hustle. But that's nothing compared to Jimmy's cocky arch nemesis, Lucas, the flamboyant Apollo Creed to Jimmy's Rocky Balboa who owns every Nintendo game in existence as well as the unstoppable Power Glove accessory that allows him to make short work of his opposition.&quot;The Wizard&quot; is about as shameless as commercial films get but it is entertaining. Having the top male TV heart throb in a movie that pretty much advertises every Nintendo game ever made at the time is sure to make a nice amount of bank. Throwing in Christian Slater wasn't a bad touch either. This ranks right up there with &quot;True Romance&quot; as his finest performance.

Youssef ""surfur""","[1, 3]","by Dane Youssef""THE WIZARD"" isn't any new moniker or fun new twist on the classic story of a little girl from Kansas who gets caught in a tornado and finds herself not only over the rainbow, but in a wonderland of Technicolor and strange characters.Well, at least not exactly.This ""Wizard"" dealt with kids in peril, feeling trapped where they were. Video games were their outlet. One boy so disturbed, he became mute and later committed after witnessing the death of his sister. The older brothers living with the father after the divorce. When a child is lost, a family is too.""The Wizard"" open with a small, determined soul walking along a long stretch of road in the pursuit of something. Some goal, some destination. Some form of escape.There's something... he's looking for. He's on his way... somewhere. Somewhere special, somewhere important. Somewhere he needs to be. It fades in like a sunrise... where is he going? We don't know. This boy's name is Jimmy. And he has a goal. He tells us, ""California...""Jimmy, in a major institution, yet breaking loose again and again like the family cat. One day during a visit, big brother Corey takes little Jimmy and the two break loose--together. At an arcade, Corey first-hand witnesses Jimmy is Bobby Fisher's predecessor at Nintendo. They use his skills to play for money. And because it's a road trip movie, they have to pick up a woman along the way.It's a PG flick for little kids (once again, Nintendo fans), so it has to a preteen like them--and they have to be just friend. Her name is Haley, an adolescent drifter. She claims to know the score... and she can raise the money to get them where they need to go.And Halley is one sizzling hustler. Wait 'til she's old enough to develop sex appeal to add to the mix.It was my mother who recalled that old song from the ""He's A Pinball Wizard"" by The Who and suggested maybe that's where the movie got its namesake. The little ditty of some soul who was a wonder at that one arcade game. It was his world. Whoever he was. Well, if anyone could relate to that...'Would've liked to hear that on the soundtrack at maybe some point.A lot of the world said that the ""Wizard"" is stuffed to the gills with commercials. But no, they were wrong. ""The Wizard"" WAS a commercial. For Nintendo and Universal.If we'd gotten scenes where we see Jimmy's connection to these games, how he becomes Zen, there might have actually been some real significance. We're just watching video games being played. And... that's all we as kids wanted from ""The Wizard.""No really powerful piece of cinema, but to just see kids like us running loose without parental supervision and Nintendo being our source of rebellion. Children as resourceful as can be doing incredible things with the toys we played with and loved.Screenwriter/producer David Chisholm seems to have cobbled this together out of spare plot threads and gimmicks. Usually filmmakers do this when they're just doing the obligated rush hatchet job and don't have their heart in the project they're working on. And you can tell--Chisholm doesn't love this screenplay of his. This is no personal project for him. This is just a Hollywood crowd-pleaser designed to feed the cult masses.The choir (us) loves video games, lives for them, thrives on them. But the makers of this movie don't. They don't care about any of this except--""Here, buy this. Spend your money on...""For all of those who belonged to the mass cult of Nintendo, this was the third coming.Seeing it again now with older, more experienced eyes... like an old man going back into his childhood home, the bedroom we once lived in, the bed once ours, looking over our own toys and photos... and, and... what the hell was I thinking? Was that even me? Who was that?What is ""Wizard""? A film of our adoration for Nintendo from our childhood, which weaved together our love of movies featuring us kids as the heroes and our undying love of the video games.... Jesus, what were we thinking?Fred Savage stands as one of the finest child actors there ever was. The Savage was just that--even better. And Luke Edwards is all right for what this role calls for--acting terminally shy at all times.For a movie about the kids and their toys, ""The Wizard"" holds some surprisingly good adult performances. Steven Grives as the electrified Video Armageddon Announcer who's like a British Christopher Lloyd as the charged-up Master of Ceremonies. And Will Seltzer as one scummy bounty hunter who tracks down runaways.Beau Bridges, commendable. Christian Slater himself, a fine actor, very fine. Like fine china. And he's given virtually nothing to do in his ""eldest brother"" role.Hey, the kids don't care about Bridges or Christian Slater--they care about Nintendo. Well, there's not much Nintendo either.For some reason, after seeing ""The Wizard"" again with older eyes, I just somehow didn't feel like video games for the time being. I wanted to get out and physically do something. Take some real action with my life. It was a few days before I picked up a Game Boy.As I was playing my usual ""Tetris"" round and trying to break my old record, I was singing quietly to myself, ""He's A Nintendo Wizard...""--Still A

If that is true...... you know what? I DONT CARE!!! I loved this movie as a kid and I still do today. Hey the average game player's age today is 25 years old. Video games are not just for kids anymore.This movie is basically about a family that is experiencing many problems: divorce, a death in the family, family communication problems, and a special needs child (Jimmy). Due to all of these family problems, Jimmy, the little boy in the movie with the special needs, is put into an institution against the wishes of his older brother Cory (Fred Savage). From there the adventure begins. Corey breaks his brother out of the institution and heads for California. Along the way, he finds out his brother has a gift.... he's a genius when it comes to video games.Thats all I want to really say about the movie. I dont want to totally spoil it for you if you havent watched it yet. This is a great family film. It can be watched by all ages. I already had it on VHS however now I have it on DVD.

I think even for '89 it was terribly dated. But if you were a child of the 80's then you could certainly relate to this movie and you will appreciate everything it stands for.""The Wizard"" stars The Wonder Years star, Fred Savage as Corey Woods. Corey is trying to save his younger brother from being institutionalized. Luke Edwards plays The Wizard, aka Jimmy Woods; an emotionally crippled little boy who has trouble articulating his thoughts.The first 10 or 15 minutes of the movie are somewhat slow-moving. But it really picks up once Corey and Jimmy hit the road and meet Haley. Eighties tween-movie maven, Jenny Lewis plays the part of the very grown-up Haley extraordinarily. They all finally come up with a plan once they see Jimmy ace a video game at a bus station.So, Jimmy, Haley and Corey all set out to hitch across 3 states (UT and NV) to make it to the video game championships (in CA.) I know this is a little far-fetched and maybe even a little screw-ballish. But think of it from a kid's perspective (after all this is a kid's movie.) Along the way, they have a few adventures in Reno while Jimmy bones up on his gaming. They also have to dodge Tate. Vince Trankina plays Tate, a smarmy detective hired by Jimmy's parents to track him down. It was so funny when Haley screamed, ""he touched my breasts"" and the security men all carry him out of the casino before he could run off with Jimmy!They all finally make it to CA, with the help of a trucker that Haley has befriended. Once at the championships, Corey's father and brother also show up looking for them (Christian Slater played Nick & Beau Bridges played Sam Woods.) It gets a little confusing, Jimmy is Corey and Nick's half-brother from Sam's second marriage to Jimmy's mother. It's a shame Christian Slater's part wasn't any bigger because he played a really good tough older brother.As a kid, my favorite scenes were during the video game tournament. Because, it was the first time I ever saw Super Mario Bros. 3. Eighteen years later, compared to even the most basic games it's like watching an antiquated dinosaur; but it's still fun to watch because it brings back fond memories.Anyway, the rest of the movie is pretty much predictable. There was a cute moment at the end when it was explained why Jimmy really wanted to go to California in the first place. Also, it loosely made viewers think that Haley was going to live with Corey and his father; at least that was the impression that I got.""The Wizard"" is a great picture for kids because there isn't any violence or profane language. I also recommend this movie to anyone that likes classic video games or to anyone that just likes corny 80's films.

Siskel and Ebert called it ""one of the worst movies of 1989"", but it's really not that bad. It is a commercial for Nintendo and Universal Studios, but it also delivers in showmanship. Jimmy(Luke Edwards) suffers from a mental disorder after his twin sister dies. His brother Corey(Fred Savage) takes him to California to compete in Video Armageddon. This is where the Nintendo game Super Mario Bros. 3 was introduced in the United States of America. Jenny Lewis plays a girl who helps Corey and Jimmy get to California for a share of the prize money. The adult Lewis is a member of a country-rock band.  Frank McRae, Beau Bridges, and Christian Slater co-star.I remember watching TV spots for The Wizard during Christmas Vacation of 1989. I didn't get a chance to watch the film until it was shown on CBS. I remember toy stores in 1990 that had countless advertisements for Super Mario Bros. 3.

His half brother played by Fred Savage decides that they are going to run away.  The quiet kid is going to get sent to a mental institution or something, and Savage can't deal with it.  Savage's older brother is played by Christian Slater, and Beau Bridges plays his dad.  Christian Slater doesn't really have a huge role, but it's nice to see him among the cast, because he has always been one of my favorite actors because of movies like Pump up the Volume, Heathers and True Romance.  I imagine the only reason he isn't one of the stars of the movie is because he hadn't become a star yet himself.  Fred Savage is annoying at times, but he still gives a pretty good performance.  and Beau Bridges is great.  I always love seeing him.  Ok, so back to the story.
