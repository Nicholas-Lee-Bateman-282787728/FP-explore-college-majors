1361850,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B003T2T4VW,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[3, 5]","Den is the closeted star of a long-running TV network series, who secretly shares his Hollywood Hills home with his much-younger lover, Colin, a former dancer who is in a wheelchair following an accident. Their domestic bliss is disturbed by the arrival of 16 year old David, who announces that he is Den's son, triggering the older man's memory of a drugged-out affair he had back then.  Now living with his grandmother Winnie, David left the home of his alcoholic stepfather.  Unfortunately, David is quite homophobic, and has a problem relating to his father's choice of life partner.  This becomes an issue later, when Winnie takes ill and David has to move in with the couple.  It's a slow transition to acceptance, and they have to deal with David's ""growing pains,"" which seem to include a same-sex fling with a rumored gay teen idol. Ultimately, David's presence has a positive effect in ways not foreseen.The film was co-written by Travis Michael Holder (who also plays Den), and is generally a good effort, despite a few distracting tangents.  The brightest spot is the excellent acting, especially from John Brotherton (""One Life To Live"") as Colin and Luke Eberl as David.  Also good to see character actress Mary Jo Catlett (who many may remember as the housekeeper in ""Different Strokes"") who plays Winnie.  Former Miss USA Deborah Shelton also has a role as Junie, a fellow actress and Den's apparent confidant, although - in my opinion - she adds nothing to the film.  My one beef: the sound is poor in several scenes, making the lines difficult to hear.  Overall, this is an amusing and positive tale about ""the family we create for ourselves,"" and I give it four stars out of five.",4,"Teen's need for a ""family"" brings love to them all.",1285632000,"09 28, 2010",2010,1699,"['Den', 'closeted', 'star', 'long-running', 'TV', 'network', 'series', 'who', 'secretly', 'shares', 'Hollywood', 'Hills', 'home', 'much-younger', 'lover', 'Colin', 'former', 'dancer', 'who', 'wheelchair', 'following', 'accident', 'domestic', 'bliss', 'disturbed', 'arrival', '16', 'year', 'old', 'David', 'who', 'Den', 'son', 'triggering', 'older', 'man', 'memory', 'drugged-out', 'affair', 'had', 'back', 'then', 'Now', 'living', 'grandmother', 'Winnie', 'David', 'left', 'home', 'alcoholic', 'stepfather', 'Unfortunately', 'David', 'quite', 'homophobic', 'problem', 'relating', 'father', 'choice', 'life', 'partner', 'issue', 'later', 'when', 'Winnie', 'ill', 'David', 'move', 'couple', 'slow', 'transition', 'acceptance', 'have', 'deal', 'David', 'growing', 'pains', 'seem', 'include', 'same-sex', 'fling', 'rumored', 'gay', 'teen', 'idol', 'Ultimately', 'David', 'presence', 'positive', 'effect', 'ways', 'not', 'foreseen.The', 'film', 'was', 'co-written', 'Travis', 'Michael', 'Holder', 'who', 'also', 'Den', 'generally', 'good', 'effort', 'few', 'distracting', 'tangents', 'brightest', 'spot', 'excellent', 'acting', 'especially', 'John', 'Brotherton', 'One', 'Life', 'Live', 'Colin', 'Luke', 'Eberl', 'David', 'Also', 'good', 'see', 'character', 'actress', 'Mary', 'Jo', 'Catlett', 'who', 'many', 'may', 'remember', 'housekeeper', 'Different', 'Strokes', 'who', 'Winnie', 'Former', 'Miss', 'USA', 'Deborah', 'Shelton', 'also', 'role', 'Junie', 'fellow', 'actress', 'Den', 'apparent', 'confidant', 'opinion', 'nothing', 'film', 'one', 'beef', 'sound', 'poor', 'several', 'scenes', 'making', 'lines', 'difficult', 'hear', 'Overall', 'amusing', 'positive', 'tale', 'family', 'create', 'give', 'four', 'five']",Surprise Surprise
