Russians understand Leo Tolstov's story, I find a lot other versions aren't as good, because the director doesn't put the actor's through culture training and understand how to be Russian it only always them playing themselves.

This is one on those rare films which prove that a long and complicated book can be filmed. Everything... from actors, who gave some outstanding performances, to sets, is almost exactly as I imagined it while reading the novel. It is not just a romantic story as it is shown in the other film versions, but a very serious, tragic social drama. This film is by far the best adaptation of the great novel.",5,An example of excellent book adaptation,1047686400,"03 15, 2003",2003,509,"['picture', 'DVD', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'perfect', 'one', 'pity', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'one', 'rare', 'films', 'prove', 'long', 'complicated', 'book', 'can', 'be', 'filmed', 'Everything', 'actors', 'who', 'gave', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'sets', 'almost', 'exactly', 'imagined', 'reading', 'novel', 'not', 'just', 'romantic', 'story', 'shown', 'other', 'film', 'versions', 'very', 'serious', 'tragic', 'social', 'drama', 'film', 'far', 'best', 'adaptation', 'great', 'novel']",Anna Karenina
723985,A2BPDFR58H9575,B0000714AV,Galina,"[15, 16]","I think that Aleksandr Zarkhi's adaptation of Leo Tolstoy's famous novel ""Anna Karenina"" is one of the best screen versions of the book. It was filmed on the locations where the novel's events took place, its characters speak in the original language, and the spirit of the book was successfully transferred to the screen mostly due to the performances and the cinematography by Leonid Kalashnikov.Tatiana Samoylova (radiant Veronica of ""The Cranes Are Flying"") plays Anna exactly as Leo Tolstoy had intended her to be, a victim of overwhelming passion, a woman who had lost herself to love, for whom the whole world had concentrated in her beloved Alexei Vronskiy, and once she felt he had became tired of her, she simply could not and did not want to live. The world famous Soviet ballerina, Maya Plisetskaya took a role of Anna's friend, Princess Betsy Tverskaya and just to see her walk is worth watching the movie. There is much more in it. Some scenes are unforgettable after so many years. Among them, the Vronsky's horse race with the rapid cuts from the faces to horses' heads scene that has to be seen to believe; the first dance of Anna and Vronsky - during the dance the lives of many people had changed forever, or the scene in the theater where Anna dared to show up after she had left her husband and moved in with Vronsky. For a woman of her social position, it was absolutely shocking and totally unforgiving. She was crucified with the looks of the St. Petersburg's Aristocracy but she was standing on the balcony all alone, beautiful and smiling and no one knew what she was going through.The original music for the film was written by Rodion Shchedrin who would write later the ballet based on ""Anna Karenina"" and his wife, Maya Plisetskaya will be dancing Anna - but it is a different story altogether",4,"""Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.""",1188172800,"08 27, 2007",2007,1822,"['think', 'Aleksandr', 'Zarkhi', 'adaptation', 'Leo', 'Tolstoy', 'famous', 'novel', 'Anna', 'Karenina', 'one', 'best', 'screen', 'versions', 'book', 'was', 'filmed', 'locations', 'where', 'novel', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'characters', 'speak', 'original', 'language', 'spirit', 'book', 'was', 'successfully', 'transferred', 'screen', 'mostly', 'due', 'performances', 'cinematography', 'Leonid', 'Kalashnikov.Tatiana', 'Samoylova', 'radiant', 'Veronica', 'Cranes', 'Are', 'Flying', 'Anna', 'exactly', 'Leo', 'Tolstoy', 'had', 'intended', 'be', 'victim', 'overwhelming', 'passion', 'woman', 'who', 'had', 'lost', 'love', 'whom', 'whole', 'world', 'had', 'concentrated', 'beloved', 'Alexei', 'Vronskiy', 'once', 'felt', 'had', 'became', 'tired', 'simply', 'could', 'not', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'live', 'world', 'famous', 'Soviet', 'ballerina', 'Maya', 'Plisetskaya', 'took', 'role', 'Anna', 'friend', 'Princess', 'Betsy', 'Tverskaya', 'just', 'see', 'walk', 'worth', 'watching', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'scenes', 'are', 'unforgettable', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'Vronsky', 'horse', 'race', 'rapid', 'cuts', 'horses', 'heads', 'scene', 'be', 'seen', 'believe', 'first', 'dance', 'Anna', 'Vronsky', 'dance', 'lives', 'many', 'people', 'had', 'changed', 'forever', 'scene', 'theater', 'where', 'Anna', 'dared', 'show', 'up', 'had', 'left', 'husband', 'moved', 'Vronsky', 'woman', 'social', 'position', 'was', 'absolutely', 'shocking', 'totally', 'unforgiving', 'was', 'crucified', 'looks', 'St.', 'Petersburg', 'Aristocracy', 'was', 'standing', 'balcony', 'alone', 'beautiful', 'smiling', 'one', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'through.The', 'original', 'music', 'film', 'was', 'written', 'Rodion', 'Shchedrin', 'who', 'would', 'write', 'later', 'ballet', 'based', 'Anna', 'Karenina', 'wife', 'Maya', 'Plisetskaya', 'will', 'be', 'dancing', 'Anna', 'different', 'story', 'altogether']",Anna Karenina

Daneker,"[15, 21]","If the flickering of the film doesn't give you a headache, then maybe the fact that the English Audio track has roughly 15 - 20 minutes of russian with subtitles that just come and go. The color is all washed out, though the picture is sharp??? Why did they only go halfway with this? Then there's the two disk thing, this film is only 2hrs 20mins long, it would easily have fit on one disk.The film itself is okay, a bit short for such a long novel (why can't they just give this a 3hr treatment?)

723987,A18PM27WKPXV92,B0000714AV,"olympio ""olympio""","[5, 5]","There's a reason Russians do the best film versions of their own literary masterpieces.  EducatedRussians, at least until very recent times, have been steeped in their culture and have too much respectfor their literary treasures to go about &#34;improving&#34; them in the Hollywood manner. For them, the question often bandied about in America--&#34;Which was better, the book or the film version?&#34;--is an idiotic one. They know thatno film can ultimately do justice to a great book. A great book ultimately requires the reader to get involved withit in a way that no film, even a great one, ever can.  Images from a film can provoke thought, but they cannot involve the viewer to the overwhelming degree that a conscientious reader can be involved by great literature.  This is not to discount the power of images. But it is to recognize the inherent difference between reading and watching, between thinking and looking. Russians know their great works of fiction, and they know that when a film is successful, it is a kind of exaltation of the main themes, characters, and ideas of the book, an invitation to and celebration of the book.  Because this is so, Russian moviemakers have traditionallykept rather close to the essentials of character and plot that are in the book.  To do anything less would call down the wrath of the nation.Hollywood, of course, and other non-Russian moviemakers are bound by no such scruples.  Hollywood sees free material (not bound by copyright problems) and instant name recognition in the great classics of the 19th century (not just Russian, but books in other literatures).  Hollywood sees a chance to remake the classics in its own image,where the artist is not bound by the same societal rules as the ordinary mortal.  Thus, in &#34;Anna Karenina,&#34;in the Garbo sound version and in the Vivian Leigh version, it becomes necessary to make her husbandas unpleasant as possible, to make Anna's conduct excusable.  The only problem with that is that both filmsjust mentioned turn Aleksei Karenin into a caricature of the bad husband.  This does violence to the portrayal in the book.  Karenin is more complex as drawn by Tolstoy, with both flaws and virtues; he also suffers, quite unlike the portraits in black delineated by Basil Rathbone and Ralph Richardson, respectively, in the aforementioned English-language films. The Russian actor who portrays Karenin does a masterful jobof embodying the complexity of this character.Tatiana Samoileva also does a masterful job of portraying Anna as do the other principals in their roles. The actor who portrays Levin, whose model, according to Tolstoy's wife, was Tolstoy himself, even resembles Tolstoy physically!  Such was the care, even in casting, which the Russians lavished when they made screen versions of their literary treasures.  They knew their public expected nothing less.  BTW, Anastasia Vertinskaya, one of the great beauties in Soviet cinema, is made up to look rather plain in this version,so that we are able to understand why Vronsky (played by an actor once Samoileva's husband!) abandons her for Anna. Most of the subplots in the novel are given some acknowlegement in this film, except for the ones involving Levin's radical revolutionary brother Nikolai.  To have included him in the film in those days probably would have complicated the making of the picture due to political considerations.This Ruscico version is in widescreen format on two discs, with some interesting extras, such as interviews with Samoileva and other participants.  Subtitles are available in both French and English.  It is also possible to watch the film with Russian subtitles if one does not chose either the English or French subtitle option.I haven't seen the new &#34;Anna Karenina&#34; with Keira Knightley, but on the evidence of this 1967 version and what I've read about the new version, they needn't have bothered.  Only thoroughgoing Russophobes and those requiring  Hollywood values to be imposed on Tolstoy's book could fail to appreciate this Russian version as the best adaptation, with the 1930s Garbo version probably bringing up the rear.",5,The best screen version of Anna Karenina.,1355529600,"12 15, 2012",2012,4152,"['reason', 'Russians', 'do', 'best', 'film', 'versions', 'own', 'literary', 'masterpieces', 'EducatedRussians', 'least', 'very', 'recent', 'times', 'have', 'been', 'steeped', 'culture', 'have', 'too', 'much', 'respectfor', 'literary', 'treasures', 'go', '34', 'improving', '34', 'Hollywood', 'manner', 'question', 'often', 'bandied', 'America', '34', 'Which', 'was', 'better', 'book', 'film', 'version', '34', 'idiotic', 'one', 'know', 'thatno', 'film', 'can', 'ultimately', 'do', 'justice', 'great', 'book', 'great', 'book', 'ultimately', 'reader', 'get', 'involved', 'withit', 'way', 'film', 'even', 'great', 'one', 'ever', 'can', 'Images', 'film', 'can', 'provoke', 'thought', 'can', 'not', 'involve', 'viewer', 'overwhelming', 'degree', 'conscientious', 'reader', 'can', 'be', 'involved', 'great', 'literature', 'not', 'discount', 'power', 'images', 'recognize', 'inherent', 'difference', 'reading', 'watching', 'thinking', 'looking', 'Russians', 'know', 'great', 'works', 'fiction', 'know', 'when', 'film', 'successful', 'kind', 'exaltation', 'main', 'themes', 'characters', 'ideas', 'book', 'invitation', 'celebration', 'book', 'so', 'Russian', 'moviemakers', 'have', 'traditionallykept', 'rather', 'close', 'essentials', 'character', 'plot', 'are', 'book', 'do', 'anything', 'less', 'would', 'call', 'down', 'wrath', 'nation.Hollywood', 'course', 'other', 'non-Russian', 'moviemakers', 'are', 'bound', 'such', 'scruples', 'Hollywood', 'free', 'material', 'not', 'bound', 'copyright', 'problems', 'instant', 'name', 'recognition', 'great', 'classics', '19th', 'century', 'not', 'just', 'Russian', 'books', 'other', 'literatures', 'Hollywood', 'chance', 'remake', 'classics', 'own', 'image', 'where', 'artist', 'not', 'bound', 'same', 'societal', 'rules', 'ordinary', 'mortal', 'Thus', '34', 'Anna', 'Karenina', '34', 'Garbo', 'sound', 'version', 'Vivian', 'Leigh', 'version', 'necessary', 'make', 'husbandas', 'unpleasant', 'possible', 'make', 'Anna', 'conduct', 'excusable', 'only', 'problem', 'filmsjust', 'mentioned', 'turn', 'Aleksei', 'Karenin', 'caricature', 'bad', 'husband', 'violence', 'portrayal', 'book', 'Karenin', 'more', 'complex', 'drawn', 'Tolstoy', 'flaws', 'virtues', 'also', 'quite', 'portraits', 'black', 'delineated', 'Basil', 'Rathbone', 'Ralph', 'Richardson', 'respectively', 'aforementioned', 'English-language', 'films', 'Russian', 'actor', 'who', 'Karenin', 'masterful', 'jobof', 'embodying', 'complexity', 'character.Tatiana', 'Samoileva', 'also', 'masterful', 'job', 'portraying', 'Anna', 'do', 'other', 'principals', 'roles', 'actor', 'who', 'Levin', 'model', 'according', 'Tolstoy', 'wife', 'was', 'Tolstoy', 'even', 'Tolstoy', 'physically', 'Such', 'was', 'care', 'even', 'casting', 'Russians', 'lavished', 'when', 'made', 'screen', 'versions', 'literary', 'treasures', 'knew', 'public', 'expected', 'nothing', 'less', 'BTW', 'Anastasia', 'Vertinskaya', 'one', 'great', 'beauties', 'Soviet', 'cinema', 'made', 'up', 'look', 'rather', 'plain', 'version', 'are', 'able', 'understand', 'why', 'Vronsky', 'played', 'actor', 'once', 'Samoileva', 'husband', 'Anna', 'Most', 'subplots', 'novel', 'are', 'given', 'acknowlegement', 'film', 'ones', 'involving', 'Levin', 'radical', 'revolutionary', 'brother', 'Nikolai', 'have', 'included', 'film', 'days', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'complicated', 'making', 'picture', 'due', 'political', 'considerations.This', 'Ruscico', 'version', 'widescreen', 'format', 'two', 'discs', 'interesting', 'extras', 'such', 'interviews', 'Samoileva', 'other', 'participants', 'Subtitles', 'are', 'available', 'French', 'English', 'also', 'possible', 'watch', 'film', 'Russian', 'subtitles', 'one', 'not', 'chose', 'English', 'French', 'subtitle', 'option.I', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'new', '34', 'Anna', 'Karenina', '34', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'evidence', '1967', 'version', 'what', ""'ve"", 'read', 'new', 'version', 'need', ""n't"", 'have', 'bothered', 'Only', 'thoroughgoing', 'Russophobes', 'requiring', 'Hollywood', 'values', 'be', 'imposed', 'Tolstoy', 'book', 'could', 'fail', 'appreciate', 'Russian', 'version', 'best', 'adaptation', '1930s', 'Garbo', 'version', 'probably', 'bringing', 'up', 'rear']",Anna Karenina
