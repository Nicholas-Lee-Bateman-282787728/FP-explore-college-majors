922027,A2L19XLK1JQS3I,B000A59PX8,"Elizabeth Bennett ""Lizzy""","[13, 13]","""For the Love of Aaron"" is a very touching film.  It deals with the challenges a mother with mental illness faces while raising her son as a single parent.  Raising kids is tough under the best of circumstances but this mom dealt with difficulties most of us thankfully will never know.  Her mental illness caused financial problems and also a co-dependant relationship with her son that might be viewed in a negative light by ""authorities"" but in reality showed that once again, love triumphs.  Meredith Baxter did a great job and the young man who played her son will capture your heart.  The chemistry between them was delightful and there were moments of humor and tears but lots and lots of ""special"" moments just because a mom and son were spending time together doing ordinary things.  Expect to shed some tears at the threat of this precious child being removed from the custody of the person who loves him more than anyone else in this world.  Due to the serious topic this movie covers, it would be more appropriate for teens and up.  This movie clearly made the point that financial excess does not guarantee that a child's true needs are being met.  The sacrificial love of a parent does more for a child than all the ""things"" this world has to offer.",4,Three Cheers for the good moms in this world!,1196553600,"12 2, 2007",2007,1263,"['Love', 'Aaron', 'very', 'touching', 'film', 'challenges', 'mother', 'mental', 'illness', 'raising', 'son', 'single', 'parent', 'Raising', 'kids', 'tough', 'best', 'circumstances', 'mom', 'dealt', 'difficulties', 'most', 'thankfully', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'mental', 'illness', 'caused', 'financial', 'problems', 'also', 'co-dependant', 'relationship', 'son', 'might', 'be', 'viewed', 'negative', 'light', 'authorities', 'reality', 'showed', 'once', 'again', 'love', 'triumphs', 'Meredith', 'Baxter', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'played', 'son', 'will', 'capture', 'heart', 'chemistry', 'was', 'delightful', 'were', 'moments', 'humor', 'tears', 'lots', 'lots', 'special', 'moments', 'just', 'mom', 'son', 'were', 'spending', 'time', 'together', 'doing', 'ordinary', 'things', 'Expect', 'shed', 'tears', 'threat', 'precious', 'child', 'being', 'removed', 'custody', 'person', 'who', 'more', 'anyone', 'else', 'world', 'Due', 'serious', 'topic', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'appropriate', 'teens', 'up', 'movie', 'clearly', 'made', 'point', 'financial', 'excess', 'not', 'guarantee', 'child', 'true', 'needs', 'are', 'being', 'met', 'sacrificial', 'love', 'parent', 'more', 'child', 'things', 'world', 'offer']",For the Love of Aaron

I speak with considerable knowledge when I say that this film accurately and sensitively portrays the sometimes co-dependent relationship between a mother and her caring young son. This is a film to watch if you really want to understand what a young carer is, or if you really want to understand all sides of the debate around such families. Meredith Baxter captures the physical and emotional nuances of a sufferer of mental illness who still has her faculties at the same time, and Keegan Macintosh nails the part of the kid who has to be flexible enough to cope with any situation that arises, whilst retaining some childhood. You'll want to comfort Baxter's Margaret Gibson, and you'll want to hug Macintosh's Aaron.
