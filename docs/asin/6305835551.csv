480386,AV8VLS7ZPUPUQ,6305835551,Carol Tessen,"[35, 37]","Alan Rickman stars as Dr. Frantz Anton Mesmer, an Austrian physician in the 18th century who is considered to be the most influential figure in the development of hypnosis.  Dr. Mesmer used magnets and metal frames in water to put his patients in a trance-like state in order to cleanse the magnetic forces in the body.  He believed that a person&#65533;s emotional and mental state was directly related to physical illness.  He felt that everyone had the ability to heal themselves of any disease just by breaking through the mental barriers and &#65533;re-aligning&#65533; the magnetic forces.  (I believe they call it &#65533;life energy&#65533; today.)Dr. Mesmer did achieve success with his treatment but was ridiculed and ostracized by the medical community.  The staid medical establishment of the time did not approve of Mesmer&#65533;s oftentimes theatrical performances and excessive showmanship.  As a result, Mesmer was condemned by his medical colleagues and forced to leave Vienna.  He practiced in Austria, Switzerland and Germany before settling in France.Mr. Rickman truly captures the charismatic and controversial character of Dr. Mesmer.  This film shows how the physician practiced his craft but I felt it didn&#65533;t really explain how he developed his technique originally.  (In fact, the film has a few unexplained gaps in it.)  The movie focuses on two of Mesmer&#65533;s patients; one is the cousin of his wife, the other is a gifted musician he encounters at a recital.  His wife&#65533;s cousin, a young girl, seems hopelessly brain damaged and he never really helps her.  The musician is a beautiful young woman (Amanda Ooms) who is blind.  Mesmer believes he can cure her blindness and becomes quite taken with her.  He discovers that her father has been sexually abusing her since she was a young child.  She lost her sight at the age of 3 and Mesmer believes that the abuse is perhaps what caused her blindness.  The doctor&#65533;s treatment to help her regain her sight seemingly fails until she falls and bumps her head.  The impression here is that the fall is what really restores her sight but Mesmer (and the woman) believes he did it.  Also highlighted in the movie is Mesmer&#65533;s relationship with his wife, which is miserable.  They seem to hate one another and I wondered why he married such a shrew in the first place.  Another unexplained gap is when Mesmer is shown living in Paris for two years and you don&#65533;t know if he is still married or not.Even with the unexplained gaps this is still a very good movie.  It is a must have for the Alan Rickman fan (which I am).  I would have given it 5 stars except for the gaps and the ending, which leaves you hanging.  After two years, the young woman is brought in to testify against Dr. Mesmer at a hearing.  With her sight restored, the musician returned home and, in so doing, returned to her sexually abusive father.  She felt abandoned by Mesmer and this, along with her father&#65533;s abuse, resulted in the loss of her sight yet again.  The movie ends with Mesmer and her just sitting silently together.  Maybe I missed something but I just didn&#65533;t get the ending.  I&#65533;ll have to watch the movie again.  Still, I do recommend it and perhaps you will find yourself mesmerized by it.",4,Wonderful!,1036713600,"11 8, 2002",2002,3303,"['Alan', 'Rickman', 'Dr.', 'Frantz', 'Anton', 'Mesmer', 'Austrian', 'physician', '18th', 'century', 'who', 'considered', 'be', 'most', 'influential', 'figure', 'development', 'hypnosis', 'Dr.', 'Mesmer', 'used', 'magnets', 'metal', 'frames', 'water', 'put', 'patients', 'trance-like', 'state', 'order', 'cleanse', 'magnetic', 'forces', 'body', 'believed', 'person', '65533', 's', 'emotional', 'mental', 'state', 'was', 'directly', 'related', 'physical', 'illness', 'felt', 'everyone', 'had', 'ability', 'heal', 'disease', 'just', 'breaking', 'mental', 'barriers', '65533', 're-aligning', '65533', 'magnetic', 'forces', 'believe', 'call', '65533', 'life', 'energy', '65533', 'today.', 'Dr', 'Mesmer', 'did', 'achieve', 'success', 'treatment', 'was', 'ridiculed', 'ostracized', 'medical', 'community', 'staid', 'medical', 'establishment', 'time', 'did', 'not', 'approve', 'Mesmer', '65533', 's', 'oftentimes', 'theatrical', 'performances', 'excessive', 'showmanship', 'result', 'Mesmer', 'was', 'condemned', 'medical', 'colleagues', 'forced', 'leave', 'Vienna', 'practiced', 'Austria', 'Switzerland', 'Germany', 'settling', 'France.Mr', 'Rickman', 'truly', 'charismatic', 'controversial', 'character', 'Dr.', 'Mesmer', 'film', 'how', 'physician', 'practiced', 'craft', 'felt', 'didn', '65533', 't', 'really', 'explain', 'how', 'developed', 'technique', 'originally', 'fact', 'film', 'few', 'unexplained', 'gaps', 'movie', 'two', 'Mesmer', '65533', 's', 'patients', 'one', 'cousin', 'wife', 'other', 'gifted', 'musician', 'recital', 'wife', '65533', 's', 'cousin', 'young', 'girl', 'hopelessly', 'brain', 'damaged', 'never', 'really', 'musician', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'Amanda', 'Ooms', 'who', 'blind', 'Mesmer', 'can', 'cure', 'blindness', 'quite', 'taken', 'father', 'been', 'sexually', 'abusing', 'was', 'young', 'child', 'lost', 'sight', 'age', '3', 'Mesmer', 'abuse', 'perhaps', 'what', 'caused', 'blindness', 'doctor', '65533', 's', 'treatment', 'help', 'regain', 'sight', 'seemingly', 'head', 'impression', 'here', 'fall', 'what', 'really', 'sight', 'Mesmer', 'woman', 'did', 'Also', 'highlighted', 'movie', 'Mesmer', '65533', 's', 'relationship', 'wife', 'miserable', 'seem', 'hate', 'one', 'wondered', 'why', 'married', 'shrew', 'first', 'place', 'unexplained', 'gap', 'when', 'Mesmer', 'shown', 'living', 'Paris', 'two', 'years', 'don', '65533', 't', 'know', 'still', 'married', 'not.Even', 'unexplained', 'gaps', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'must', 'have', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'fan', 'am', 'would', 'have', 'given', '5', 'stars', 'gaps', 'ending', 'hanging', 'two', 'years', 'young', 'woman', 'brought', 'testify', 'Dr.', 'Mesmer', 'hearing', 'sight', 'restored', 'musician', 'returned', 'home', 'so', 'doing', 'returned', 'sexually', 'abusive', 'father', 'felt', 'abandoned', 'Mesmer', 'father', '65533', 's', 'abuse', 'resulted', 'loss', 'sight', 'yet', 'again', 'movie', 'Mesmer', 'just', 'sitting', 'silently', 'together', 'Maybe', 'missed', 'something', 'just', 'didn', '65533', 'get', 'ending', '65533', 'll', 'have', 'watch', 'movie', 'again', 'Still', 'do', 'recommend', 'perhaps', 'will', 'find', 'mesmerized']",Mesmer

What about seances,crystal therapy,faith healings, chiropractic and primal scream therapy? There are numerous avenues to healing out there and some, along with their adherers may be considered a little wacky by some! Well.. If you have ever wondered where the phrase ""you've got animal magnetism"" gets it's origin you will learn it here in this very different film MESMER starring the enigmatic and creepy Alan Rickman.In 1774,Franz Anton Mesmer produced what he called ""the artificial tide"".The patient swallowed a liquid containing iron and then had  magnets to their body. Mesmer believed that the ""animal magnetism"" that accululated in his body controlled the liquid flow in the patient thus curing all ills. Thus we get the term ""mesmerized.""Patients would seem in trance states for hours. Multitudes watched as these ""cures"" were performed.They were ""high drama"" and frankly curious entertainment for the wealthy of the time!This film, though, particularly follows the scandal that resulted from Mesmer's unsuccessful attempt at curing the blindness of Maria Paradis, and teenage musician in Vienna.This debacle resulted in Mesmer's fleeing to Paris where he continued his work with one physician of high standing, Charles d'Eslon.This film is odd to say the least, and frankly some are going to think ""What was Alan Rickman (Mesmer) thinking???"" Well, frankly no one could have played the bizarre Mesmer any more compellingly than Mr. Rickman.  Mesmer's ideas in the studies of the body and health are not at all unlike many of the more esoteric means of curing ills that exist today! Rickman plays Mesmer with complete abandon and mysteriousness that WAS Anton Mesmer. One scene that depicts Mesmer's group cure called ""the baquet"" still stays in my mind to this day! Twenty people sat connected to each other and to metal rods that were attached to a large round vessel. As Mesmer would pass by each person, his animal magnetism would pass to the participants producing all kinds of fits and convulsing! FASCINATING and FASCINATINGLY FILMED!!!!Yes, his techniques were of such high drama and SO unorthodox that one might be tempted to write this film off as folly. IT IS NOT! Anyone revolutionary thinker/charlatan/crack-pot/genius has his or hers believers and detractors.

As marriages were in those days.The movie then... Yes, at times Rickman's voice was very hard to hear and the plot seems a bit loose. I admit he's got the most expressive face, eyes, voice and hands in the movie business and for once they were very well portrayed. In fact, the movie seems to rely on them. I was a bit confused, too, what was the point of the movie. Was it a historical piece, romantic story - it even had some comedy, as great tragedies often have. Mesmer seems to fail, although in real life he actually did cure people. And then he said his bit about how much pain there is in the world and how he could not bare not to be able to do anything to relieve it. And there was the point; that's why Dennis Potter, already dying, wrote the script this way. Even the kissing scene, which to many people seems very romantic and sexy, seemed sad to me. As if Mesmer couldn't believe something like that really happens to him. Even the ending made sense, then. This is a man, whose heart is aching to do something good in a world filled with pain and cruelty, selfishness and ignorance, but fails because one man isn't enough. Even the one he cures isn't saved, because the world doesn't understand what he was trying to do, what he was trying to make people see. Dennis Potter's testament, maybe?Oh yes, Rickman was born to wear cloaks (see Snape and Sheriff of Nottingham) and white ruffles around his throat, Amanda Ooms is lovely and the acting and the sceneries are great. And to remind, why Rickman is so great as a villain, he gets to throw the boy down the stairs. Suddenly a burst of energy and passion, making the character even more complicated, more human - because that's what Rickman does at his best: complete, complicated, deeply human characters.It's a very different kind of movie and many may not like it, but it's well worth watching. One gets to see an actor like Rickman far too little, and Dennis Potter was an excellent writer, even if this wasn't his best script. I loved it.

I did do investigation of Mesmer before watching the movie in order to know what type of character he was portraying.  The entire subject was intreguing.  It brings to light the inadequancies of medicine during this time.  The lack of common sense is appalling.  BLEEDING people???  I don't think so.  He brought to light the connection between a person's body and mind.  Making them work together.  The blindness of Maria Theresa, obviously a result of her fathers physical abuse of her at an early age, was sad because he could have cured her, but she was taken away by the money grubbers too soon.

I did not find the story difficult, but I did do some research prior to watching it.  I did some reference work through my university, but also on something as accessible as wikipedia.  If you look there, it gives you a lucid, coherent outline of Mesmer and his research, aw well as his methods of practice.  If you gain a little background , then this movie flows beautifully!I found this movie to be amazingly filmed, and the acting, especially by Rickman was superb.  I cannot think of another actor who can draw your attention and hold it without even having to speak, and then when he does, there is no other voice like it - silky, melodic, and can touch your very soul.  Rickman himself is 'mesmerizing.'The sets and scenes shot for this film are breathtaking, and I believe that this film will captivate anyone who is fascinated in the rise of reason that was taking place in Europe during the 1600s-1700s.  What you begin to realize is that Mesmer had truly discovered the power of magnetism, and its potential healing properties on the body.  Sadly, this radicalism of thought was in its infancy, and therefore ultimately led to his undoing in a time of bloodletting.  This film helps the viewer to see that despite the Enlightenment, there was still a profoundly medieval consensus of thought running through the scientific and medical worlds.  The men who spoke of superstition and foolhardy practices being rooted out of their practice could not let go of antiquated harmful treatments themselves.  They called Mesmer a charlatan and a fraud  because his form of treatment was so unconventional and ""perverse"" to them, and yet when you see the forms of treatment that the conventional physicans were using at the time, you see the absurdity of their accusations.I highly reccommend this film.  It is beautiful, it is wonderfully acted, and touching.  It is also a profoundly enjoyable film that can be watched again and again.  I do reccommend though, that you do a bit of research to acquaint yourself with Mesmer.  This will help put the film into perspective.  It will also make you realize and appreciate what an amazing job Alan Rickman did in portraying this man!",5,"""Prepare"" to be MESMERized!",1194134400,"11 4, 2007",2007,2366,"['have', 'read', 'other', 'review', 'board', 'regarding', 'movie', 'saw', 'common', 'theme', 'person', 'saying', 'film', 'was', 'bit', 'hard', 'follow', 'even', 'thought', 'liked', 'whole', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'story', 'difficult', 'did', 'do', 'research', 'prior', 'watching', 'did', 'reference', 'work', 'university', 'also', 'something', 'as', 'accessible', 'wikipedia', 'look', 'there', 'lucid', 'coherent', 'outline', 'Mesmer', 'research', 'aw', 'well', 'methods', 'practice', 'gain', 'little', 'background', 'then', 'movie', 'beautifully', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'amazingly', 'filmed', 'acting', 'especially', 'Rickman', 'was', 'superb', 'can', 'not', 'think', 'actor', 'who', 'can', 'draw', 'attention', 'hold', 'even', 'having', 'speak', 'then', 'when', 'other', 'voice', 'silky', 'melodic', 'can', 'touch', 'very', 'soul', 'Rickman', ""'mesmerizing"", 'sets', 'scenes', 'shot', 'film', 'are', 'breathtaking', 'believe', 'film', 'will', 'captivate', 'anyone', 'who', 'fascinated', 'rise', 'reason', 'was', 'taking', 'place', 'Europe', '1600s-1700s', 'What', 'begin', 'realize', 'Mesmer', 'had', 'truly', 'discovered', 'power', 'magnetism', 'potential', 'healing', 'properties', 'body', 'Sadly', 'radicalism', 'thought', 'was', 'infancy', 'therefore', 'ultimately', 'led', 'undoing', 'time', 'bloodletting', 'film', 'viewer', 'see', 'Enlightenment', 'was', 'still', 'profoundly', 'medieval', 'consensus', 'thought', 'running', 'scientific', 'medical', 'worlds', 'men', 'who', 'spoke', 'superstition', 'foolhardy', 'practices', 'being', 'rooted', 'practice', 'could', 'not', 'let', 'go', 'antiquated', 'harmful', 'treatments', 'called', 'Mesmer', 'charlatan', 'fraud', 'form', 'treatment', 'was', 'so', 'unconventional', 'perverse', 'yet', 'when', 'see', 'forms', 'treatment', 'conventional', 'physicans', 'were', 'using', 'time', 'see', 'absurdity', 'accusations.I', 'highly', 'reccommend', 'film', 'beautiful', 'wonderfully', 'acted', 'touching', 'also', 'profoundly', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'watched', 'again', 'again', 'do', 'reccommend', 'do', 'bit', 'research', 'acquaint', 'Mesmer', 'will', 'help', 'put', 'film', 'perspective', 'will', 'also', 'make', 'realize', 'appreciate', 'what', 'amazing', 'job', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'did', 'portraying', 'man']",Mesmer
