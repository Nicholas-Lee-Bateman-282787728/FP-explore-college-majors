432148,AJSYTZQVJJOYW,6304683308,A. Abela,"[4, 5]",This adaptation had many ups and downs in my opinion. Scenes with Samuel and Saul were well done but the whole Bathsheba and David scenarios didn't seem right. Sheryl Lee was miscast and looked in no way from the middle east at all. David from that point turned bland and uninteresting as there was not enough praise of God and his relationship with him. From all the psalms that he wrote you would think he'd have more of a spirit for God but this was not shown as such. Overall its an okay introduction but make sure you read your bible first and know what's accuarte and what's not.,3,An average adaptation,1152144000,"07 6, 2006",2006,585,"['adaptation', 'had', 'many', 'ups', 'downs', 'opinion', 'Scenes', 'Samuel', 'Saul', 'were', 'well', 'done', 'whole', 'Bathsheba', 'David', 'scenarios', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'right', 'Sheryl', 'Lee', 'was', 'miscast', 'looked', 'way', 'middle', 'east', 'David', 'point', 'turned', 'bland', 'uninteresting', 'was', 'not', 'enough', 'praise', 'God', 'relationship', 'psalms', 'wrote', 'would', 'think', ""'d"", 'have', 'more', 'spirit', 'God', 'was', 'not', 'shown', 'such', 'okay', 'introduction', 'make', 'sure', 'read', 'bible', 'first', 'know', 'what', 'accuarte', 'what', 'not']",N/A

432150,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,6304683308,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[93, 98]","This is a marvelous production, filmed in Morocco, with wonderful costumes, textiles, and rustic sets, making this telling of King David's life visually believable. It has some standout performances, and Nathaniel Parker, always a favorite of mine, fares well as Israel's second king. As Saul, the casting of Jonathan Pryce is an odd choice (Saul was &quot;a head taller than his people&quot; and there was &quot;not a man more handsome than he&quot;) but it works, and he is exceptional as the tormented and demented king.Gideon Turner is very good as the young David, Dominic Rowan is a great bit of casting as Absalom, and as Joab, Maurice Roeves is terrific. Other notables play the two prophets, Leonard Nimoy, in an appealing and powerful portrayal of Samuel, and Franco Nero as a handsome Nathan.Due to this being made for TV, some of the editing does not move smoothly (one assumes these are cuts for ads) but that aside, the photography is lovely (by Raffaele Mertes) and the melodic score by Carlo Siliotto enhances the mood (the final title music is by Ennio Morricone).The story line picks up at 1 Samuel, Chapter 9, with Saul looking for his father's mules, and proceeds through much of both books of Samuel, often being quite faithful to them. It is interspersed with the occasional Psalm, and writer Larry Gross has blended scripture and dialogue quite effectively. It is interesting to watch this with Bible in hand, to see just how cleverly this has been done.There are some moving scenes, like David's annointing, and his proposal to Abigail (played by the beautiful Lina Sastri). The only part that does not work for me is the story of Amnon; it is pieced together in an awkward and sluggish way, but fortunately does not last long, and the rest of the intricate story moves along at a quick pace, making this is a way above-average film for television.There are a few gory battle scenes that would be too violent for the very young, but otherwise this is an excellent family film for older children, with the complexity of King David making it a fascinating story for discussion and repeated viewings.",5,the great psalmist and king,1069459200,"11 22, 2003",2003,2121,"['marvelous', 'production', 'filmed', 'Morocco', 'wonderful', 'costumes', 'textiles', 'rustic', 'sets', 'making', 'telling', 'King', 'David', 'life', 'visually', 'believable', 'standout', 'performances', 'Nathaniel', 'Parker', 'always', 'favorite', 'mine', 'well', 'Israel', 'second', 'king', 'Saul', 'casting', 'Jonathan', 'Pryce', 'odd', 'choice', 'Saul', 'was', 'quot', 'head', 'taller', 'people', 'quot', 'was', 'quot', 'not', 'man', 'more', 'handsome', 'quot', 'exceptional', 'tormented', 'demented', 'king.Gideon', 'Turner', 'very', 'good', 'young', 'David', 'Dominic', 'Rowan', 'great', 'bit', 'casting', 'Absalom', 'Joab', 'Maurice', 'Roeves', 'terrific', 'Other', 'notables', 'play', 'two', 'prophets', 'Leonard', 'Nimoy', 'appealing', 'powerful', 'portrayal', 'Samuel', 'Franco', 'Nero', 'handsome', 'Nathan.Due', 'being', 'made', 'TV', 'editing', 'not', 'move', 'smoothly', 'one', 'are', 'cuts', 'ads', 'aside', 'photography', 'lovely', 'Raffaele', 'Mertes', 'melodic', 'score', 'Carlo', 'Siliotto', 'mood', 'final', 'title', 'music', 'Ennio', 'Morricone', '.The', 'story', 'line', 'up', '1', 'Samuel', 'Chapter', '9', 'Saul', 'looking', 'father', 'mules', 'proceeds', 'much', 'books', 'Samuel', 'often', 'being', 'quite', 'faithful', 'interspersed', 'occasional', 'Psalm', 'writer', 'Larry', 'Gross', 'blended', 'scripture', 'dialogue', 'quite', 'effectively', 'interesting', 'watch', 'Bible', 'hand', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'cleverly', 'been', 'are', 'moving', 'scenes', 'David', 'annointing', 'proposal', 'Abigail', 'played', 'beautiful', 'Lina', 'Sastri', 'only', 'part', 'not', 'work', 'story', 'Amnon', 'pieced', 'together', 'awkward', 'sluggish', 'way', 'fortunately', 'not', 'last', 'long', 'rest', 'intricate', 'story', 'moves', 'along', 'quick', 'pace', 'making', 'way', 'above-average', 'film', 'are', 'few', 'gory', 'battle', 'scenes', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'violent', 'very', 'young', 'otherwise', 'excellent', 'family', 'film', 'older', 'children', 'complexity', 'King', 'David', 'making', 'fascinating', 'story', 'discussion', 'repeated', 'viewings']",N/A

There is far more action in this earlier film, which brings me to the point in this review. It must have been stymied by that wretched breed: ACCOUNTANTS! a pox on them! There was far too much in the production that smacked of cost-saving, particularly the 'Goliath' scene which rendered it incomprehensible c.f. the Bible account. Now that I have that off my chest, they have redeemed themselves by employing great actors. I particulaly liked the portrayal of Saul by Jonaththan Price. They could have added another 30 mins. or so to the 1st. part and issued it separately as 'SAUL', then a 2 part series on 'DAVID'. Jonathan's effective portrayal of a man going from greatness to madness is worth the price of the video alone. Leonard Nimoy also portrays the prophet Samuel very well as a compassionate man of God who must stick to principle, no matter how much it grieves his soul.

It will probably send you back to the scriptures to read it again.The movie started out a little slowly for me, but then picked up. About 1/4 of the way through, I was enjoying it very much. It was worth staying with it.I enjoyed Leonard Nimoy in the part of the Prophet, Samuel, a choice I never would have considered. He made that character come to life.All-in-all, this movie had everything I was looking for and told the story well.There were a few problems for me with the way they matched up David's wives and children. He had more wives than were shown and I don't think they got that part right. In fact, Michal was childless according to the scriptures.When Saul's daughter, Michal, David's first wife, saved David's life, the movie shows that she put one of her maids in the bed so that the guards killed her, thinking she was David, meaning that the maid was killed instead of him. That isn't the way the scriptures tell it. Michal put an idol in the bed and something with goat's hair to look like David was sleeping there.When Saul had the priests killed because they had given David food and Goliath's sword, the movie showed about 5-6 priests being killed. The scriptures say there were 85 priests killed that day, and then they went on to the city of the priests and continued by killing the priests' families and all their livestock. Only one person escaped.When Abigail returned home from taking supplies to David and asking his forgiveness for the disgraceful way her husband Nabal had treated him, she didn't tell Nabal what she had done because he was having a big party and was drunk. She told him the next day and he didn't just drop dead. He had a stroke and died 10 days later.The actors did a great job and the scenery and clothing worked well. I did think it was strange that one of David's sons seemed to have an australian accent, another interesting choice.I recommend the Solomon DVD to follow this one.",5,An Excellent Presentation of The Life of King David,1270944000,"04 11, 2010",2010,2000,"['recommend', 'movie', 'visual', 'review', 'Biblical', 'story', 'will', 'probably', 'send', 'back', 'scriptures', 'read', 'again.The', 'movie', 'started', 'out', 'little', 'slowly', 'then', 'picked', 'up', '1/4', 'way', 'was', 'enjoying', 'very', 'much', 'was', 'worth', 'staying', 'it.I', 'enjoyed', 'Leonard', 'Nimoy', 'part', 'Prophet', 'Samuel', 'choice', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'considered', 'made', 'character', 'come', 'life.All-in-all', 'movie', 'had', 'everything', 'was', 'looking', 'told', 'story', 'well.There', 'were', 'few', 'problems', 'way', 'matched', 'up', 'David', 'wives', 'children', 'had', 'more', 'wives', 'were', 'shown', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'got', 'part', 'right', 'fact', 'Michal', 'was', 'childless', 'according', 'scriptures.When', 'Saul', 'daughter', 'Michal', 'David', 'first', 'wife', 'saved', 'David', 'life', 'movie', 'put', 'one', 'maids', 'bed', 'guards', 'killed', 'thinking', 'was', 'David', 'meaning', 'maid', 'was', 'killed', 'instead', ""n't"", 'way', 'scriptures', 'tell', 'Michal', 'put', 'idol', 'bed', 'something', 'goat', 'hair', 'look', 'David', 'was', 'sleeping', 'there.When', 'Saul', 'had', 'priests', 'killed', 'had', 'given', 'David', 'food', 'Goliath', 'sword', 'movie', 'showed', '5-6', 'priests', 'being', 'killed', 'scriptures', 'say', 'were', '85', 'priests', 'killed', 'day', 'then', 'went', 'city', 'priests', 'continued', 'killing', 'priests', 'families', 'livestock', 'Only', 'one', 'person', 'Abigail', 'returned', 'home', 'taking', 'supplies', 'David', 'asking', 'forgiveness', 'disgraceful', 'way', 'husband', 'Nabal', 'had', 'treated', 'did', ""n't"", 'tell', 'Nabal', 'what', 'had', 'done', 'was', 'having', 'big', 'party', 'was', 'drunk', 'told', 'next', 'day', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'drop', 'dead', 'had', 'stroke', 'died', '10', 'days', 'later.The', 'actors', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'scenery', 'clothing', 'worked', 'well', 'did', 'think', 'was', 'strange', 'one', 'David', 'sons', 'seemed', 'have', 'australian', 'accent', 'interesting', 'choice.I', 'recommend', 'Solomon', 'DVD', 'follow', 'one']",N/A
432156,ADES8B01WRPI3,6304683308,"Bryan E. Leed ""Jesus says, 'Go and Sin No More!""","[23, 24]","If you are considering buying this film, may I recommend that you save tons of money by buying it in THE BIBLE COLLECTION BOX SET, which contains 6 of these Bible movies, ABRAHAM, JACOB, JOSEPH, MOSES, SAMSON & DELILAH, and DAVID! The production values are very high for all six films, and you will pay half off the cost of buying each one separately!DAVID is one of the best DVDs of this series of Bible movies, made in the mid 1990s. It covers most of the big scenes in his life, and it is very well cast and acted by all.The first hour shows the young David being anointed, and then persecuted for years under the jealous King Saul.The second hour covers David at his peak, as King of Israel.The third hour shows David's sin and punishment over his adultery with Bathsheba, and God's punishment using his rebellious son Absalom.This is all very gripping and enjoyable drama, especially for any Bible students who can enjoy seeing so many Bible scenes not often portrayed in other films.They cover a lot of Scripture, without an unlimited budget, so sometimes they have to alter some details of the stories. For instance, the famous David versus Goliath battle does not take place in front of the Philistine and Israeli armies, as in Scripture, but rather in isolation. It's a budgetary rewrite, but the dramatic impact and tension is still present.The filmmakers' intentions are honorable, though their budget may not have been ambitious enough to portray some of the larger, more expensive scenes out of Scripture.If they had to cut some corners due to budget, they more than make up for it in the quantity and quality of the Scriptural scenes that they do show. One of the best sections of the DVD is David's adulterous relationship with Bathsheba, then his scheming against Uriah, her husband.The scenes of Absalom trying to overthrow his father are very well made, and very scriptural, as well.The actor playing the adult David does a brilliant performance, portraying many decades in the life of David. Leonard Nimoy (Mr. Spock of STAR TREK fame) is good as Samuel, (though the Richard Gere film KING DAVID has the definitive, ultimate onscreen chemistry of Samuel and King Saul).The actors for King Saul and Bathsheba are both very good in this DVD's version of DAVID.You can also find three other great movies from this series of movies. Look for the BIBLE SERIES BOX SET featuring ESTHER, JEREMIAH and SOLOMON, too. These are also your best buy in the box set, rather than separately!Of these 9 Bible movies, three are about 90 minutes long, JACOB. ESTHER, and JEREMIAH. The other 6 are around 3 hours long. I think the longer ones were originally aired as TV mini series, over multiple nights.Of all these films, my one criticism might be that they are a bit weak on showing some of the supernatural events of Scripture. This seems to be due to the expense of special effectts, perhaps, is my guess. But for the most part, all 9 DVDs are great at having very good actors portraying the tension and drama of these classic Bible stories, and they are consistently good at being faithful to the gist and Spirit of the Bible stories they tell.I think these 9 DVDs are the best series of Bible DVDs available anywhere! There are better, single movies on DVD, but as a group, as a whole, there is not a bigger, better DVD set available anywhere, that I know of.These box sets are the perfect basis for any personal or church library of Bible movies. They are virtually all so close to Scripture that you will be forced to compare the films with the actual Bible in hand, to verify whether or not the scene was accurate to Scripture or not. That is a very good Bible learning exercise, and it shows the high value and quality of owning these DVDs.All 9 of these Bible DVDs are worth buying and owning for any Christian's personal DVD library, and most frugally purchased via the two different box sets!

432159,AB34G6VKP28L,6304683308,"Charity Bishop ""Film Fanatic""","[1, 1]","My experience with Biblical films has been varied. Many of them have good intentions and a poor delivery, but this presentation is on par with the best of them. David is a surprisingly moving and engaging retelling of one of the Old Testament's most memorable figures.When a mysterious storm arises and the donkeys belonging to Saul (Jonathan Pryce) vanish before his sons' very eyes, he and his son Jonathan (Ben Daniels) set out to learn what has become of their property. Their search takes them into a neighboring community and places them in the path of Samuel (Leonard Nimoy), a prophet who has been instructed by God to anoint a leader for the Israelites. He informs Saul that he has been chosen to command their armies and preside as king, a position that Saul feels unworthy of but accepts. God establishes him as a man of influence and power but when Samuel departs to heed the voice of God and leaves Saul to ponder what might be done against the invading Philistine army, Saul begins to doubt that God is with him. His attempt to communicate with God rather than waiting for Samuel's return deeply grieves God, who promises that he will be replaced -- and sends Samuel out once more to choose an eventual successor. This time, Samuel finds him in a shepherd boy named David, whose earnest desire to please God is so profound that he will do anything in His name.David is known far and wide for his remarkable playing and singing and so when Saul is plagued by ""demons"" that will not allow him to sleep, Jonathan asks David if he will not come and soothe his father's rest. David becomes an invaluable member of the king's household and eventually takes a stand against their brutal enemy, Goliath, that wins the approval of the people and generates a profound jealousy in Saul. David (Nathanial Parker) must then flee for his life ... but much lies ahead for this future king of Israel, an individual who became known in scripture as a ""man after God's own heart.""Most films in this genre suffer from stilted casting and poor directing but this television film is excellent. It has a great cast, most of which are recognizable from other period pieces and films. Parker is a wonderful David -- he takes a character that could be flat and uninteresting beyond his achievements and transforms him into a living, breathing person that the audience falls in love with not merely as a hero in the classic sense, but as a man of immense faith and respect for God. I admit that I have always thought of David in somewhat skeptical terms since scripture does not allow us to ""know him"" beyond his accomplishments (and several enormous mistakes) but once finishing this movie, it made me want to go back and read his portion of scripture. Parker is just the right blend of youth and innocence and an almost overwhelming sense of compassion. The most profound moments are his scenes of remorse and grief in the aftermath of his adulterous tryst and with what happens between his sons. The supporting cast is also quite good. Nimoy is a subdued but memorable Samuel, and Franco Nero is a superb Nathan. While the leading ladies do not have an enormous role, they are worth mentioning. It also has an absolutely beautiful musical score.While the story does stick primarily to the scriptural account, there are some minor changes made. Saul is much older than he would have been when we first meet him and does not fit the physical description; David is anointed alone (in scripture, his brothers witness the ceremony); the battle with Goliath happens with only two onlookers (as opposed to two individual armies); Nabal's death happens sooner in the film than it did in real life; Uriaha meets a different fate. It is a little confusing later on as to which of his sons are from what wives, and who their companions actually are. My only true complaint is that Goliath is a little bit of a letdown -- he's a large man but not nearly as impressive as I anticipated.I admire the film for being restrained in dealing with the darker aspects of the story, and also for its uplifting conclusion. It does not end at the death of David but many years before, with his assurance that in spite of his shortcomings, his household is to be blessed forever. Out of the many films based on scripture, this will probably become my favorite for its rich characters. If you can tolerate its occasional brutality, you will find it as engaging as I did.",3,Surprisingly Moving,1332374400,"03 22, 2012",2012,4435,"['experience', 'Biblical', 'films', 'been', 'varied', 'Many', 'have', 'good', 'intentions', 'poor', 'delivery', 'presentation', 'par', 'best', 'David', 'surprisingly', 'moving', 'engaging', 'retelling', 'one', 'Old', 'Testament', 'most', 'memorable', 'figures.When', 'mysterious', 'storm', 'arises', 'donkeys', 'belonging', 'Saul', 'Jonathan', 'Pryce', 'vanish', 'sons', 'very', 'eyes', 'son', 'Jonathan', 'Ben', 'Daniels', 'set', 'out', 'learn', 'what', 'become', 'property', 'search', 'neighboring', 'community', 'places', 'path', 'Samuel', 'Leonard', 'Nimoy', 'prophet', 'who', 'been', 'instructed', 'God', 'anoint', 'leader', 'Israelites', 'Saul', 'been', 'chosen', 'command', 'armies', 'preside', 'king', 'position', 'Saul', 'unworthy', 'accepts', 'God', 'man', 'influence', 'power', 'when', 'Samuel', 'heed', 'voice', 'God', 'Saul', 'ponder', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'done', 'invading', 'Philistine', 'army', 'Saul', 'doubt', 'God', 'attempt', 'communicate', 'God', 'rather', 'waiting', 'Samuel', 'return', 'deeply', 'grieves', 'God', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'replaced', 'sends', 'Samuel', 'out', 'once', 'more', 'choose', 'eventual', 'successor', 'time', 'Samuel', 'shepherd', 'boy', 'named', 'David', 'earnest', 'desire', 'please', 'God', 'so', 'profound', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'name.David', 'known', 'far', 'wide', 'remarkable', 'playing', 'singing', 'so', 'when', 'Saul', 'plagued', 'demons', 'will', 'not', 'allow', 'sleep', 'Jonathan', 'David', 'will', 'not', 'come', 'soothe', 'father', 'rest', 'David', 'invaluable', 'member', 'king', 'household', 'eventually', 'stand', 'brutal', 'enemy', 'Goliath', 'approval', 'people', 'profound', 'jealousy', 'Saul', 'David', 'Nathanial', 'Parker', 'must', 'then', 'flee', 'life', 'much', 'lies', 'ahead', 'future', 'king', 'Israel', 'individual', 'who', 'became', 'known', 'scripture', 'man', 'God', 'own', 'heart', 'Most', 'films', 'genre', 'suffer', 'stilted', 'casting', 'poor', 'directing', 'television', 'film', 'excellent', 'great', 'cast', 'most', 'are', 'recognizable', 'other', 'period', 'pieces', 'films', 'Parker', 'wonderful', 'David', 'character', 'could', 'be', 'flat', 'uninteresting', 'achievements', 'living', 'breathing', 'person', 'audience', 'love', 'not', 'merely', 'hero', 'classic', 'sense', 'man', 'immense', 'faith', 'respect', 'God', 'admit', 'have', 'always', 'thought', 'David', 'somewhat', 'skeptical', 'terms', 'scripture', 'not', 'allow', 'know', 'accomplishments', 'several', 'enormous', 'mistakes', 'once', 'finishing', 'movie', 'made', 'want', 'go', 'back', 'read', 'portion', 'scripture', 'Parker', 'just', 'right', 'blend', 'youth', 'innocence', 'almost', 'overwhelming', 'sense', 'compassion', 'most', 'profound', 'moments', 'are', 'scenes', 'remorse', 'grief', 'aftermath', 'adulterous', 'tryst', 'what', 'sons', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'quite', 'good', 'Nimoy', 'subdued', 'memorable', 'Samuel', 'Franco', 'Nero', 'superb', 'Nathan', 'leading', 'ladies', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'enormous', 'role', 'are', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'also', 'absolutely', 'beautiful', 'musical', 'score.While', 'story', 'stick', 'primarily', 'scriptural', 'account', 'are', 'minor', 'changes', 'made', 'Saul', 'much', 'older', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'when', 'first', 'meet', 'not', 'fit', 'physical', 'description', 'David', 'anointed', 'alone', 'scripture', 'brothers', 'witness', 'ceremony', 'battle', 'Goliath', 'only', 'two', 'onlookers', 'opposed', 'two', 'individual', 'armies', 'Nabal', 'death', 'sooner', 'film', 'did', 'real', 'life', 'Uriaha', 'different', 'fate', 'little', 'confusing', 'later', 'sons', 'are', 'what', 'wives', 'who', 'companions', 'actually', 'are', 'only', 'true', 'complaint', 'Goliath', 'little', 'bit', 'letdown', 'large', 'man', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'impressive', 'anticipated.I', 'film', 'being', 'restrained', 'dealing', 'darker', 'aspects', 'story', 'also', 'uplifting', 'conclusion', 'not', 'end', 'death', 'David', 'many', 'years', 'assurance', 'spite', 'shortcomings', 'household', 'be', 'blessed', 'forever', 'many', 'films', 'based', 'scripture', 'will', 'probably', 'become', 'favorite', 'rich', 'characters', 'can', 'tolerate', 'occasional', 'brutality', 'will', 'find', 'as', 'engaging', 'did']",N/A

The second part deals with David's fall and the beginning of his rise from the ashes through his successor Solomon.

Nathaniel Parker(Hamlet) is David King of Israel. Beloved of God and fallen from grace because of the beautiful Bathsheba(Sheryl Lee), father of a treacherous son and father of the wisest King on earth, this story will astound! The story begins with David taking Jerusalem also called Zion. Later it was named The City of David. The Jebusites inhabited the land before David took Jerusalem (2 Sam 5:7). Then the story goes back back to the time of Saul before he was king. Saul meets the prophet Samuel(Leonard Nimoy) and they sup. Leonard Nimoy does a smashing performance. Saul played by Jonathan Pryce(Pirates of the Caribbean) comes with his sons to sup with the prophet and Samuel tells Saul that the people want a King and he is to be that King! Then Samuel anoints Saul. Some small scenes of the Bible were cut out such as Jonathan's victory at Michmash. Saul defends Israel but defies God many times. The movie goes to Saul's disobedience by performing a sacrifice without waiting for Samuel's return. Then Saul is told to destroy the Amalekites and their oxen, children, ect. Saul however disobeys God and spares Agag. This displeases God and God tells Samuel He repents making Saul King. It is then that Samuel kills Agag and goes into the hills to find a new King, the shepherd boy David! The movie is very close to the Bible and was very realistic to the clothing and scenes. Each actor played their part well. Franco Nero plays Nathan who schools and watches over David after Samuel's death. The movie concludes with God forgiving David and telling him that he has shed blood and will not build his house. Instead his son Solomon will be the next King of Israel and will build the Temple. The movie was shot on location in the Moroccan Desert. Other films of the Bible Series include Solomon played by Ben Cross, Esther, Paul, Moses and many others all of which  were filmed in the beautiful desert of Morocco.

Burton ""Bookworm""","[4, 4]","This movie, (originally broadcast on TNT), is a stirring depiction of the life of King David, ""the man after God's own heart."" The accurate production rarely deviates from Scripture.  The miniseries is a wonderful visual representation of the life of one of the most complex men in all of human history.Spanning the time from Saul's anointing to David's death, the film covers a great quantity of ground in a very effective way.  The director does a superb job of emphasizing David's triumphs and struggles.  Interspersed into the action are stirring excerpts from some of David's psalms, which provide a glimpse into David's heart.  I particularly appreciate the fact that David's shortcomings, (most notably his sin with Bathsheba), is not glorified nor sugarcoated.  God's Word does not condone sin, yet it does not gloss over it either.  Therefore, David is a man who struggles with God as we all do.The three aspects of the film I particularly enjoyed were:1. The portrayal of the rivalry between Saul and David.  Jonathan Price is magnificent as the complex Saul: a man risen from humble beginnings to become Israel's king: a man driven mad by his lust for power and prestige.2. The episode with Bathsheba and Uriah.  Nathaniel Parker is exceptional in this scene.  He portrays a man driven by desperation to conceal an evil act.  However, even while plotting Uriah's downfall, he is still sympathetic.  There is even a brief instance where the viewer thinks he will turn from his devious actions.3. Absalom's rebellion.  This heartwrenching depiction illustrates how human nature never changes, and how children still seek their parents love even when they have done wrong.  This portrayal also illustrates how children become angry with parents so easily.  Absalom is portrayed as a multi-layered character, one whom the viewer can empathize with.  The consequences of David's wrongdoing affected his entire family, and the scene with Amnon and Tamar is horrifying and unforgettable.  The viewer sympathizes with Absalom even if he/she does not condone his actions toward David.Besides the two actors previously mentioned, Lennard Nemoy is outstanding as the prophet Samuel.  These three men turn in stellar performances.My final comment is that I love the scenes where God speaks.  The actor doing this voice over is perfect: God is portrayed as having a gentle yet firm voice, reminiscent of a kindly father, and the voice throbs with anger, compassion, and love.  ""David"" reminds us all that we must confess and repent of our sins, and illustrates God's supreme and magnificent grace.  Please give this excellent movie a chance.

432188,A3CPX27XQ4BOKX,6304683308,moviemusicbuff,"[17, 19]","This movie is a faithful adaptation from the biblical account of David and it gives a positive portrait of him.A. The actingNathaniel Parker does a commendable job of portraying David as a reverent yet flawed servant of God. There is an interesting contrast in the earlier David versus the latter David.  The earlier David was very focussed on God and was very assertive and focussed.  The latter David, while dependent upon God, was hesitant about his actions, prone to failures and needed constant encouragement.Sheryl Lee was very believable (and beautiful) as Bathsheba -- as this movie portrays her, she is David's favorite wife and constant source of encouragement in his latter years.  She is constantly at David's side (during the 2nd half of the movie).Jonathan Pryce played the role of Saul as a tragic man who was rejected by God and who could not escape his doom.  Saul's tragic end at the hand of the Philistines (along with his sons) was very heartbreaking to watch.Leonard Nimoy does a great job of portraying the godly prophet Samuel.  Franco Nero is very believable as the loyal prophet Nathan.The actor who played Joab (Maurice Roeves, who played Colonel Munroe in ""the Last of the Mohicans"" 1992 version) looks way too old to be David's nephew. Joab is the 2nd son of Zeruiah, the sister of David, hence David's nephew.  Joab is portrayed as David's uncle. Maurice Roeves did a great job in portraying Joab. Some of the best scenes in this film involves Joab, especially when Joab rebukes David for mourning over his dead son Jonathan rather than congratulating his loyal friends for their victory.  The biblical portrait of Joab is that of a powerthirsty and cruel man.  This film portrays him in a much more positive and sympathetic light.B.  The account of DavidThis film is the most complete account of David captured on film.  This film is the only one on David that shows David's rescue of his wife Abigail from the Amalekites, Absalom's hatred toward David and his conspiracy toward David / the rise and fall of Absalom,  Amnon's rape of Tamar, and God's covenant promise to David regarding his kingdom and his future descendants who will build the temple.One word of caution for family viewers:  there are some scenes in this movie that might be too intense for younger viewers:  a lot of people get stabbed in the battle scenes, several people commit suicide (Saul, Ahithophel), and the witch at Endor is pretty scary looking as she conjures up the spirit ""Samuel"".C.  What could have been improveda) The close relationship between Jonathan and David could have been better depicted.  In this film, David's friendship with Jonathan seems more detached.  In the Bible, David describes his friendship with Jonathan as surpassing that of the love of women.b) The fight between David and Goliath could have been better portrayed.  Goliath was a towering giant -- the Goliath in this movie was just a tad taller than David (and bears somewhat of a resemblance to Sylvester Stallone).  Also, Goliath met David with his armor bearer -- this movie had Goliath meet David alone.  This movie shows Goliath throwing a rough stone at David, which David then uses to strike Goliath with his sling.  In the biblical account, David carefully chooses 5 smooth stones to bring with him to the battle.The fight between David and Goliath was a bit cheesy in the acting. However, to its credit, this movie shows David telling Goliath that he came to Goliath not with spear and sword but in the name of the Lord of Hosts.  David tells Goliath he will strike him down so the whole world will know there is a God in Israel.  I enjoyed that part.c) The scenes involving Absalom were excellent in the earlier scenes (esp. his anger over the rape of Tamar), but the latter scenes were not as effective.  Absalom did not seem like a real threat to David.One interesting scene to note:David's progress in hearing the voice of the Lord:  During his early days and during most of his reign, David relied upon prophets such as Samuel and Nathan to hear the message of the Lord for him.

432202,ATB8MP2M9L5PM,6304683308,"Transcendental Thomist ""jeb815""","[0, 0]","This movie is the best you will find on King David, the best-cast film of the TNT Bible Series, and one of the finest entries in that very fine collection of Biblical films. Like all the films in that series, it uses top-notch actors and favors a style of realism over supernatural manifestations, giving us fully developed human characters rather than special effects. But this film is more focused and less boring than some other titles in the series. It is remarkably fast-moving for a 3-hour TNT miniseries, being well-edited with short punchy action sequences and well-staged dramatic confrontations. Sticking close to 1 and 2 Samuel from the Bible, it also includes a generous helping of the psalms attributed to David, and is the most biblically accurate film on this subject available.But here's the bottom line: The film is just plain entertaining and exciting, managing to be such while sticking remarkably close to the Biblical source text. It has a fantastic musical score, great sets and costumes, serviceable battle scenes, and perfectly cast actors. Teens and adults will not find their attention wavering for most of the running time here. As a TV film, the emphasis is decidedly on character drama over spectacle, but the battles are good too. For a film without large-scale battles, the script moves swiftly, with the acting and music delivering genuine thrills -- as in the Goliath battle and ensuing sequence with young David carrying the severed head in a triumphant daze -- even though one wishes for greater numbers of soldiers to avoid the appearance of mere skirmishes this film evokes. Nathaniel Parker (picking up from Gideon Turner as the younger David) makes a great King David, exhuding strong self-assurance as a leader, but also displaying human weakness and many other emotional nuances in his character arc. He's clearly doing the Bible as Shakespeare here and it works very well. Also in the Shakespearean vein, the always-excellent Jonathon Pryce plays King Saul in full Lear mode, giving us a tragic and pathetic figure whose demise comes about through his disobedience of God. Leonard Nimoy, the Jewish actor who originated Mr. Spock on ""Star Trek,"" surprises the most with a deeply felt and finely wrought performance as the prophet Samuel -- he nails the essence of a fiery and passionate Old Testament prophet with only a few major scenes early in the film, particularly in the anointings and in his final confrontation with Saul and King Agag. His performance is brilliant. Franco Nero does the same with the prophet Nathan, but is more of a background character here. Sheryl Lee makes a memorable Bathsheba and even the minor players -- particularly those playing David's children -- leave a favorable impression.The film's first half describes the rise and fall of King Saul, the rise of David to war hero and prince apparent, and the demise of Saul. Second half focuses on David's sin with Bathsheba, the family problems David had due to his adultery, and the rebellion led against him by his son. The film loses some of its energy and intensity in the last 50 minutes, giving us a bit too much dialogue that feels expository rather than building to a genuinely thrilling showdown between David and Absalom, as the showdown with Saul from the film's first half had been truly involving. But it regroups nicely with a joyful epilogue prefiguring the Temple. In the TNT Bible Series, this is my second favorite OT film behind the Emmy-winning ""Joseph,"" being a notch down because of the protracted climax just mentioned. The film ""Moses"" with Ben Kingsley (my third favorite) is also excellent, but is a bit slow-moving compared to this one, making it a harder sell even for teenaged audiences. If you want an Old Testament/Torah film that is Biblically accurate (mostly) and edifying without totally sacrificing entertainment, then this is the film for you. I showed it to 16-year old religion students and they loved it as a catechetical tool that really helped them understand the scattered OT books that relate to David's life.",5,Exciting and dramatic take on King David,1383004800,"10 29, 2013",2013,4074,"['movie', 'best', 'will', 'find', 'King', 'David', 'best-cast', 'film', 'TNT', 'Bible', 'Series', 'one', 'finest', 'entries', 'very', 'fine', 'collection', 'Biblical', 'films', 'films', 'series', 'top-notch', 'actors', 'favors', 'style', 'realism', 'supernatural', 'manifestations', 'giving', 'fully', 'developed', 'human', 'characters', 'rather', 'special', 'effects', 'film', 'more', 'focused', 'less', 'boring', 'other', 'titles', 'series', 'remarkably', 'fast-moving', '3-hour', 'TNT', 'miniseries', 'being', 'well-edited', 'short', 'punchy', 'action', 'sequences', 'well-staged', 'dramatic', 'confrontations', 'Sticking', 'close', '1', '2', 'Samuel', 'Bible', 'also', 'generous', 'helping', 'psalms', 'attributed', 'David', 'most', 'biblically', 'accurate', 'film', 'subject', 'here', 'bottom', 'line', 'film', 'just', 'plain', 'entertaining', 'exciting', 'managing', 'be', 'such', 'sticking', 'remarkably', 'close', 'Biblical', 'source', 'text', 'fantastic', 'musical', 'score', 'great', 'sets', 'costumes', 'serviceable', 'battle', 'scenes', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'actors', 'Teens', 'adults', 'will', 'not', 'find', 'attention', 'wavering', 'most', 'running', 'time', 'here', 'TV', 'film', 'emphasis', 'decidedly', 'character', 'drama', 'spectacle', 'battles', 'are', 'good', 'too', 'film', 'large-scale', 'battles', 'script', 'swiftly', 'acting', 'music', 'delivering', 'genuine', 'thrills', 'Goliath', 'battle', 'ensuing', 'sequence', 'young', 'David', 'carrying', 'severed', 'head', 'triumphant', 'daze', 'even', 'one', 'wishes', 'greater', 'numbers', 'soldiers', 'avoid', 'appearance', 'mere', 'skirmishes', 'film', 'Nathaniel', 'Parker', 'picking', 'up', 'Gideon', 'Turner', 'younger', 'David', 'great', 'King', 'David', 'exhuding', 'strong', 'self-assurance', 'leader', 'also', 'displaying', 'human', 'weakness', 'many', 'other', 'emotional', 'nuances', 'character', 'arc', 'clearly', 'doing', 'Bible', 'Shakespeare', 'here', 'very', 'well', 'Also', 'Shakespearean', 'vein', 'always-excellent', 'Jonathon', 'Pryce', 'King', 'Saul', 'full', 'Lear', 'mode', 'giving', 'tragic', 'pathetic', 'figure', 'demise', 'disobedience', 'God', 'Leonard', 'Nimoy', 'Jewish', 'actor', 'who', 'originated', 'Mr.', 'Spock', 'Star', 'Trek', 'most', 'deeply', 'felt', 'finely', 'wrought', 'performance', 'prophet', 'Samuel', 'essence', 'fiery', 'passionate', 'Old', 'Testament', 'prophet', 'only', 'few', 'major', 'scenes', 'early', 'film', 'particularly', 'anointings', 'final', 'confrontation', 'Saul', 'King', 'Agag', 'performance', 'brilliant', 'Franco', 'Nero', 'same', 'prophet', 'Nathan', 'more', 'background', 'character', 'here', 'Sheryl', 'Lee', 'memorable', 'Bathsheba', 'even', 'minor', 'players', 'particularly', 'playing', 'David', 'children', 'leave', 'favorable', 'impression.The', 'film', 'first', 'half', 'rise', 'fall', 'King', 'Saul', 'rise', 'David', 'war', 'hero', 'prince', 'apparent', 'demise', 'Saul', 'Second', 'half', 'David', 'sin', 'Bathsheba', 'family', 'problems', 'David', 'had', 'due', 'adultery', 'rebellion', 'led', 'son', 'film', 'energy', 'intensity', 'last', '50', 'minutes', 'giving', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'dialogue', 'expository', 'rather', 'building', 'genuinely', 'thrilling', 'showdown', 'David', 'Absalom', 'showdown', 'Saul', 'film', 'first', 'half', 'had', 'been', 'truly', 'involving', 'nicely', 'joyful', 'epilogue', 'prefiguring', 'Temple', 'TNT', 'Bible', 'Series', 'second', 'favorite', 'OT', 'film', 'Emmy-winning', 'Joseph', 'being', 'notch', 'down', 'protracted', 'climax', 'just', 'mentioned', 'film', 'Moses', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'third', 'favorite', 'also', 'excellent', 'bit', 'slow-moving', 'compared', 'one', 'making', 'harder', 'sell', 'even', 'teenaged', 'audiences', 'want', 'Old', 'Testament/Torah', 'film', 'Biblically', 'accurate', 'mostly', 'edifying', 'totally', 'sacrificing', 'entertainment', 'then', 'film', 'showed', '16-year', 'old', 'religion', 'students', 'loved', 'catechetical', 'tool', 'really', 'helped', 'understand', 'scattered', 'OT', 'books', 'relate', 'David', 'life']",N/A
432203,A3AW8XP45YVIIZ,6304683308,Utah Blaine,"[57, 62]","This made-for-TV movie recounts the stories contained in 1 and 2 Samuel of the Bible about Israel's warrior-king David, and is one of a series of movies about important figures of the Old Testament.  I've reviewed some of the other movies previously, and overall this is a terrific series, but this film is certainly one of the weakest.  My biggest complaint about this film is it's length.  At 3+ hours, this film is way too long, and there are large parts where the action is very slow.  Not that I'm against long films, but the time was not put to good use.  There is certainly a great deal of ground that must be covered in order to recount more or less all of 1 and 2 Samuel, but this film should either have been condensed or separated into two.  The image portrayed of David in this film is also not very sympathetic.  He certainly doesn't come across as a great warrior king.  He steals the wife of one of his loyal soldiers, and can't control his own family.  I understand that these are biblical events, but the story is presented in such a way to give the appearance that David rules simply because it is God's will no matter how sinfully or stupidly he behaves.  Nathaniel Parker (who plays the role of David) appeared stiff and not very kingly in my view.  Leonard Nimoy plays the prophet Samuel though, he certainly has an air of gravitas about him as the prophet.  There are some things I liked about this film.  First, the writers/producers stuck largely to the biblical story.  Second, as with all films in this series, they are largely devoid of denominational overtone, so that I think they will appeal to a wide range of Christians and Jews.  I thought that the David/Goliath scene was particularly well done.  Goliath was a large, powerful, but otherwise ordinary man, not some mythic giant who would be more at home in Nordic mythology fighting Thor.  A good, if flawed, film.
