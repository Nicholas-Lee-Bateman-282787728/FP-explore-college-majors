Among the great episodes this season include The Jimmy (I dare you NOT to laugh when Kramer, numb from the dentist, was mistaken as a mentally challenged person), The Fusilli Jerry (where we first meet Patrick Warburton as David Puddy), The Pledge Drive (who doesn't remember the snickers bar?), The Switch (where we learn Kramer's first name, Cosmo), The Race (""I choose not to run""), The Big Salad and The Diplomat's Club.This is certainly a great year of Seinfeld and personally I'd rank it slightly ahead season five.",5,perhaps Seinfeld's most underrated season,1136419200,"01 5, 2006",2006,861,"['season', '6', 'was', 'year', 'finally', 'made', 'Seinfeld', '1', 'think', 'season', 'be', 'forgotten', 'when', 'referencing', 'Seinfeld', 'great', 'seasons', 'IMO', 'seasons', '3-7', 'were', '1-2', '8-9', 'were', 'decent', 'still', '.While', 'nothing', 'season', 'as', 'famous', 'Contest', 'Puffy', 'Shirt', 'still', 'much', 'love', 'great', 'episodes', 'season', 'include', 'Jimmy', 'dare', 'NOT', 'laugh', 'when', 'Kramer', 'numb', 'dentist', 'was', 'mistaken', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'person', 'Fusilli', 'Jerry', 'where', 'first', 'meet', 'Patrick', 'Warburton', 'David', 'Puddy', 'Pledge', 'Drive', 'who', ""n't"", 'remember', 'snickers', 'bar', 'Switch', 'where', 'learn', 'Kramer', 'first', 'name', 'Cosmo', 'Race', 'choose', 'not', 'run', 'Big', 'Salad', 'Diplomat', 'Club.This', 'certainly', 'great', 'year', 'Seinfeld', 'personally', ""'d"", 'rank', 'slightly', 'ahead', 'season', 'five']",N/A

Hell I have to be honest and admit I'd probably buy the sets without the extras because I love the show so much but I think Seinfeld & David  are doing right by their fans.  My favorites are always the bloopers.  I laugh watching them almost as much as I laughed during the episodes' original run.I agree with another poster that this is consistently the most enjoyable season of Seinfeld.  I cannot believe another poster feels the 5th season is superior when it was the 5th that foisted 3 of the worst-ever Seinfeld episodes on us fans(The Bris, The Barber and The Sniffing Accountant are clearly at the bottom rung of the ladder when it comes to quality Sein episodes).  As opposed to Season 6, where I can watch each & every episode over & over.  I realize there are many who will argue that the 4th & 7th seasons were better.  But when you look at all of this seasons episodes collectively there is hardly a clunker in the bunch.  Imo, this is the season Julia Louis-Dreyfus really came into her own as Elaine.  After the brilliant season 5 ending episode ""The Opposite"", she is forced to work as lowly assistant to elderly millionaire Justin Pitt (brilliantly played by Ian Abercrombie) and will also meet the person who will become her on-again off-again romance for the rest of the series and that is David Puddy, also brilliantly played by Patrick Warburton.  Btw, I'm not sure why so many trash Warburton.  The Puddy-Elaine saga made me laugh almost more than any other plot line in the last several seasons.  This was also the season that saw George's involvement with The New York Yankees as the assistant to the traveling secretary.  Yet another minefield of brilliant comedy.  ""The Calzone"" is another favorite season 6 episode of mine and I just loved David doing Stein's voice in that one.  Season 6 also contains an episode that would probably make many ""true"" Seinfeld fans top ten of all time list and that is ""The Jimmy"".  Kramer is simply hysterical in that one.  Lastly, season 6 contains what is one of my favorite visual moments in the show ever and that is in the episode ""The Race"" as Jerry crosses the finish line and Elaine runs over to congratulate him, Jerry knocks her out of the way so he can hug his girlfriend.  I don't know why, but that scene never fails to double me over with laughter.  Overall, I wish the creators of other television shows would look at what Seinfeld-David & The Simpsons gang have done with their product.

Any Seinfeld fan is going to buy these season collections no matter what, but it is great to see the extended versions of the deleted scenes (where we get to see a bit more of the episode on either side of the deleted scene, which was missing from previous season DVDs before last season) has continued.  Master of His Domain (Stand up Material) was sensational on this season and was unique stuff not seen at the start of the episodes or during the show as had been the case on previous DVDs as well as Jerry Seinfeld's Telling You For the Last Time stand up comedy compact disc.Classic episodes abound in Season 6 with classic scenes such as George's girlfriend taking credit from Elaine for his ""Big Salad"" purchase, Bania offering Jerry his suit in exchange for a meal, Elaine confusing the hightalker his girlfriend with her friend, George eating from the bin, Kramer's encounter with a zoo monkey and George getting a toupee and finding out his date is a bald woman.  It's also great to see big name actors who found fame after Seinfeld in many of these episodes.  Bryan Cranston who plays Hal (the dad) in Malcolm in the Middle is dentist Dr Tim Whatley who has the apartment throwing the thanksgiving parade party which Jerry doesn't know if he is invited to, his character is also a regifter, and ultimately maybe together with his female assistant violated Jerry in the dentist's chair. Actress Christa Lawrence from The Drew Carey Show and now Scrubs (Jordan ex wife of Dr Cox), dated George and told Elaine that looks weren't important to her.  The mother (Kitty Forman) from That 70's Show played by Debra Rupp was the overhelpful annoying personal assistant who told Jerry the pilot from their flight was in the audience.These stars, the brilliant cast of Seinfeld and the extras make Season 6 a must own collection.

939843,A3T9IX8EDFDX4G,B000BBOUFE,John Alapick,"[7, 8]","Seinfeld-Season 6 would see the sitcom finally hit #1 in the Nielsen ratings. This was also the season where the storylines became more complicated as Jerry, Elaine, George, and Kramer would all be involved in one caper or another in the same episode. George's parents, Frank and Estelle Costanza, as well as Jerry's parents, Morty and Helen Seinfeld, and Newman are featured more prominently and we also see the debut of several strong role players such as Mr. Pitt, David Puddy, and Kenny Bania. Amazingly, the storylines stayed strong throughout the season as several episodes would become classics. And while Jerry was usually considered the weakest of the four main actors, his work improved a lot during this season.Disc 1 starts the season out strong with the excellent episodes ""The Big Salad"" and ""The Pledge Drive"" as well as the hysterical classic, ""The Couch."" ""The Chinese Woman"" and ""The Gymnast"" are also very good episodes, both showing the continuing neuroses of the Costanzas. The sitcom always seems to have great episodes on Disc 2 and this is no exception with ""The Soup"", ""The Switch"", where we finally learn Kramer's first name, and ""The Race"" all being classic episodes. Disc 3 is also top notch, featuring the excellent ""The Scofflaw"", ""The Kiss Hello"", and ""The Doorman"", also known as ""The Bro"", as well as the two-part ""Highlights of 100"" episode. Disc 4 starts out with the classic episode ""The Jimmy"", which earned Michael Richards an Emmy for Best Supporting Actor, the excellent ""The Fusili Jerry"", and the strong season finale, ""The Understudy"", which mirrors the Tonya Harding/Nancy Kerrigan fiasco, only with Bette Midler, of all people, playing the victim. As usual, the extras are just as strong as the episodes. The Running With the Egg featurette that shows how an episode of Seinfeld is created is probably the best feature thus far in the Seinfeld series. The bloopers are also very funny from this season, especially the ones from ""The Fusili Jerry"" episode. The deleted scenes, inside looks, exclusive stand-up material, and the Notes About Nothing are also top notch.

The scenes that are cut to insert commercials by syndicators are restored on the high quality DVD versions.  I grew up in the United States and had always liked the series from television.  I was married while living/working/studying in China in 2002 and bought the DVD's for my wife on our coming to the United States in 2005.  She had never seen Seinfeld before and had never been exposed to this style of humor or the slice of American life that the series presents.  We have watched the DVD's over and over again and they never fail to make us laugh and lift our spirits when we've had a bad day.  We utilize the closed captioning option and it has been a great help for my wife in acquiring an understanding of casual English usage including slang, and idiom.  On a more serious note, owning so many seasons and watching the episodes regularly makes you realize the sad truth that much of American life really is focused on the themes of myopic self-interest presented and ridiculed in this series. I sometimes worry that individuals may actually see the series as a validation of their lack of ethics, morals, and connection with the Creator instead of as a revelation and jabbing at today's inappropriate social dynamics; just as the Archie Bunker/All In the Family series did in the 1970's.The DVD sets include great special features from ""How It Began"" to ""Making a Seinfeld Episode"", deleted scenes, behind the scenes commentary from cast and creators, never-before-seen standup footage of Jerry, original NBC promotional ads and trailers, outtakes and bloopers, and much, much more.  It's obvious that a lot of thought and work went into producing the DVD sets and I can't wait until the remaining seasons come out for sale at Amazon.  After all; ""Who wouldn't love Jerry?""Episodes included in this set are:Season 6 - The Chaperone, The Big Salad, The Pledge Drive, The Chinese Woman, The Couch, The Gymnast, The Mom & Pop Store, The Soup, the Secretary, The Switch, The Race, The Label Maker, The Scofflaw, The Highlights of 100 (Parts 1 & 2), The Beard, The Kiss Hello, The Doorman, The Jimmy, The Doodle, The Fusilli Jerry, The Diplomat's Club, The Face Painter, The Understudy.",5,More Than Just a Comedy Series,1150502400,"06 17, 2006",2006,2259,"[""'re"", 'T.V', 'Seinfeld', 'fan', 'will', 'absolutely', 'love', 'DVD', 'scenes', 'are', 'cut', 'insert', 'commercials', 'syndicators', 'are', 'restored', 'high', 'quality', 'DVD', 'versions', 'grew', 'up', 'United', 'States', 'had', 'always', 'liked', 'series', 'television', 'was', 'married', 'living/working/studying', 'China', '2002', 'bought', 'DVD', 'wife', 'coming', 'United', 'States', '2005', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'Seinfeld', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'exposed', 'style', 'humor', 'slice', 'American', 'life', 'series', 'presents', 'have', 'watched', 'DVD', 'over', 'over', 'again', 'never', 'fail', 'make', 'laugh', 'lift', 'spirits', 'when', ""'ve"", 'had', 'bad', 'day', 'utilize', 'closed', 'captioning', 'option', 'been', 'great', 'help', 'wife', 'acquiring', 'understanding', 'casual', 'English', 'usage', 'including', 'slang', 'idiom', 'more', 'serious', 'note', 'owning', 'so', 'many', 'seasons', 'watching', 'episodes', 'regularly', 'realize', 'sad', 'truth', 'much', 'American', 'life', 'really', 'focused', 'themes', 'myopic', 'self-interest', 'presented', 'ridiculed', 'series', 'sometimes', 'worry', 'individuals', 'may', 'actually', 'see', 'series', 'validation', 'lack', 'ethics', 'morals', 'connection', 'Creator', 'instead', 'revelation', 'jabbing', 'today', 'inappropriate', 'social', 'dynamics', 'just', 'Archie', 'Bunker/All', 'Family', 'series', 'did', ""1970's.The"", 'DVD', 'sets', 'include', 'great', 'special', 'features', 'How', 'Began', 'Making', 'Seinfeld', 'Episode', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'scenes', 'commentary', 'cast', 'creators', 'never-before-seen', 'standup', 'footage', 'Jerry', 'original', 'NBC', 'promotional', 'ads', 'trailers', 'outtakes', 'bloopers', 'much', 'much', 'more', 'obvious', 'lot', 'thought', 'work', 'went', 'producing', 'DVD', 'sets', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'remaining', 'seasons', 'come', 'out', 'sale', 'Amazon', 'Who', 'would', ""n't"", 'love', 'Jerry', 'Episodes', 'included', 'set', 'are', 'Season', '6', 'Chaperone', 'Big', 'Salad', 'Pledge', 'Drive', 'Chinese', 'Woman', 'Couch', 'Gymnast', 'Mom', 'Pop', 'Store', 'Soup', 'Secretary', 'Switch', 'Race', 'Label', 'Maker', 'Scofflaw', 'Highlights', '100', 'Parts', '1', '2', 'Beard', 'Kiss', 'Hello', 'Doorman', 'Jimmy', 'Doodle', 'Fusilli', 'Jerry', 'Diplomat', 'Club', 'Face', 'Painter', 'Understudy']",N/A

939852,A1IE92NL2EYQLH,B000BBOUFE,Michael Hellen,"[1, 1]","Hi,To me, this is a classic show. It has it's moments of,'sexual implication',(some sexual issues), but I feel that the humor makes the negative impact watchable. This is a funny show because of the characters that are on it. First, there is Jerry. He is a clean cut, 'picky' male who meets many women, but finds something 'wrong' with each of them, and ends up alone again, until he meets someone else, and then the same thing happens again. He seems to not let anyone, especially his friends, get the upper hand. Then there is George. George is also a single male who has the belief that he is never going to meet 'the right one', and is in despair because of it. When he does meet someone  will go out him, he always does something to ruin it, like have bad table manners, or act too desperate. Jerry has a neighbor named Kramer who likes to make wild, unannounced  entrances through Jerry's door. He provides the 'slapstick comedy' for the show. He is clumsy, and is always falling, or knocking things over,(like Dick van Dyke on his show). He likes to think of himself as knowledgeable about everything that Jerry, George, and Elaine are saying. He is like the referee. He is single. As I mentioned, the last main character on the show is a lady named Elaine. She is friends with Jerry. She is also single. She is a 'domineering, no nonsense' lady who has a high I.Q. She likes to shove Jerry back and say,""Get Out"" when Jerry tells her good news. There are other characters on the show who might only be on for that one episode. Oh, there is a character named Newman who Jerry despises, and Newman feels the same way about him.

By the time this season was airing, Seinfeld had become a cultural phenomenon, a show that was spoken about around the water cooler at offices daily for its brilliant humour. This season features numerous hit episodes, probably most notably ""Fussili Jerry"", ""The Soup"", ""The Race"", and ""The Couch"".Obviously each of these episodes in its own right is hilarious, but another thing that makes this DVD set totally worth your money are the extras. The Inside Looks feature excellent commentary and often explanations for plotlines, and included in the interviews are the whole cast of Seinfeld, and people such as Larry David, Tom Cherones, Larry Charles and more. The Deleted Scenes are also very interesting, and offer great twists on many of the episodes.My Favourite Episodes (please watch them all though):The Switch: Jerry is dating a woman who doesn't laugh at any of his jokes and wants to switch girlfriend's with the woman's roommate.The Jimmy: Elaine goes on a date with a guy who refers to himself in the third person and meanwhile Kramer is mistaken for a mentally challenged person.The Face Painter: Elaine learns her boyfriend David Puddy likes to paint his face for playoff hockey games.The Label Maker: Elaine gives Tim Whatley a label maker which he chooses to re-gift.Along with all the Seinfeld dvds, Season 6 is highly recommended as a classic from the catalog. Although they hit their stride long before this, this dvd shows their ability to continue bringing the laughter show after show. Arguably the greatest sitcom ever.

I don't think anyone who didn't like the show would be interested in buying the DVD set anyway.This is a good set. I like the slimcases and the way they fit into the box. There are a lot of extras.  I love that there are little mini-documentaries (Inside Look features) for many of the episodes. There are several episode commentaries, and a few other features that I haven't found as interesting, but that some people might like, such as Notes about Nothing which seems to be trivia about the show.What I don't like:The animations and repeated lines when you're on the main menu are annoying.  They also often give away the funniest lines in the episodes *before* you watch them, since it's the first menu that you see.  Since I haven't seen the episodes in a few years or maybe missed one or two, I'd rather be surprised by the best and funniest lines while watching the episodes rather than to hear them repeated over and over and over before I start the episode.  (Animations and especially music or any type of sound are both always annoying when they're part of a menu on a DVD set.  I wish they'd stop doing this with all DVD sets.)You have to watch the long sequence of warnings before every episode.The menu interface on each disk is different and confusing. I hate trying to figure out what to click on and where the lines are, etc.  I often click on the wrong thing by mistake before I figure it out. I'd prefer a plain text menu that's the same on every disk--and the same on every set.The Inside Look features often have repeated interviews and *long* sequences from the episode that we most likely just watched.  It would have been better to leave out these long sequences from the episodes and keep the Inside Look features a bit shorter. The ones on the earlier disks didn't seem to contain as much episode footage and I liked them better.Overall, this is a good set with just a few nitpicky things wrong with it, and nothing that would stop me from buying the set.

939859,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B000BBOUFE,Robert I. Hedges,"[4, 4]","This is a good season of Seinfeld, though perhaps not as outstanding as season four or five. Nonetheless, there some great episodes in this set, and the extras are wonderful. In this season I had a couple of clear favorites: first and foremost is ""The Fusilli Jerry,"" which is a classic in combining seemingly disparate story lines...I could never have imagined how Kramer's vanity license plates and the pasta figurine of Jerry would fit together in the end. For this episode there is also an excellent commentary track featuring Jason Alexander and Julia Louis-Dreyfus. This isn't the only commentary track on the set, but it is the funniest.On the down side, there were a couple of weaker episodes this season that, while good, didn't really live up to ""classic"" status like most of the rest of the series. Of course taste is a subjective thing, but I found ""The Big Salad"" to be a bit slowly paced, and while it is apparently a fan favorite, I never really liked ""The Jimmy"" all that much either. The ""Highlights of 100"" is an interesting retrospective show, while ""The Beard"" has some of the more conceptually entertaining subplots in the season.One special feature of note in this set is ""Running With The Egg,"" a documentary about the making of a ""Seinfeld"" episode, largely told through informative and entertaining interviews, mostly with Jerry. All told, this is a fine season, and while not my favorite, it is still superior television in an excellent box set.

939862,A2K0KFEUZE0K0Q,B000BBOUFE,Sparky Lightbulb,"[1, 2]","What does ""Seinfeld"" do best? It examines the ways we can protect egos. Think about it: Whenever the fragile human body is at risk, governments and manufacturers spell out the rules. They tell us, for example, to buckle our seat belts; with certain products, we must avoid contact with eyes, refrigerate after opening, and use in a well-ventilated area.We say the ego can be ""bruised,"" but we mean this metaphorically, for an intangible can suffer no physical harm. Egos cannot, say, slip on icy sidewalks. As a result, no one posts guidelines to protect our inner selves, and people are left to wonder, ""Did I just hurt that guy's feelings, or should I be the one to take offense?"" Luckily, the writers and cast of ""Seinfeld"" explore the rules that even Miss Manners doesn't address, such as how long to date someone after a night of disappointing sex. Season 6 continues this tradition.Why are we so ignorant about protecting the ego? ""Seinfeld"" shows that interacting with our fellow humans is like crossing state lines. Just as an activity might be legal in Massachusetts but outlawed in Georgia, one character will find an opinion or action tolerable while another does not. And when belief systems collide, egos get damaged.For example, Elaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) requires people, especially boyfriends, to mirror her views. In ""The Couch,"" she meets a handsome, unpretentious furniture mover but then breaks up with him because he doesn't share her stance on abortion. Her ego cannot risk constant impact with a different conviction. And in ""The Face Painter,"" she almost abandons Puddy (Patrick Warburton), another great male, because in preparation for a hockey playoff game, he dresses as the devil. To date Elaine, Puddy must endure her irrational requirements, like not painting his face. Angering Elaine with beliefs different from her own can be an unpleasant experience, as restaurateur Poppie (Reni Santoni) discovers when Elaine harangues him so badly over his pro-life opinions that he ends up in the hospital.Sometimes the Seinfeld characters know the appropriate behavior, but like reckless drivers ignoring the speed limit, they break the rules anyway, hoping their egos will survive the crash. In ""The Gymnast,"" George (Jason Alexander) spies a nearly pristine eclair in the garbage. The trashcan lid might not warn, ""Do not consume contents,"" but George still knows that he shouldn't eat what's inside. When his girlfriend's mother steps into the kitchen and observes his bad behavior, her gasp is just as panic inducing as the lights of a police cruiser in the rear-view mirror.Getting caught eating garbage deflates George's ego. He looks bad not only to this witness but also to anyone who hears the story, so he tries to rationalize what he's done. He explains to Jerry that the eclair was ""above the rim"" and ""still had the doily,"" but Jerry--as unsympathetic as a highway patrolman--considers these explanations as lame as ""I was just flowing with the traffic."" He tickets George with his disapproval. (And the audience's egos feel good, for even if we ate an unhealthy dessert that day, at least ours didn't come from the trash.)Time and time again, ""Seinfeld"" demonstrates that loss of status can crumple an ego like a distracted driver T-boning another vehicle. One guarantee of status is treating other people with such respect that everyone observing the behavior thinks highly of the well-mannered character. In ""The Jimmy,"" Elaine dates a man after a misunderstanding about his name, not because she finds him interesting or attractive. Likewise, in ""The Soup,"" Jerry agrees to take the annoying Bania (Steve Hytner) to dinner as a thank-you for an Armani suit, not because he enjoys the company of his fellow comedian.On the other hand, when someone points out impolite behavior, the character loses status and scrambles to minimize the damage to his ego. In ""The Couch,"" Kramer (Michael Richards) notes that Jerry should have offered the deliverymen a cold drink. Since furniture movers do not have ""Please hydrate"" stamped on their coveralls, Jerry obsesses over the unintended offense. He doesn't want either his friend or the deliverymen to think less of him.An even more interesting loss of status occurs in ""The Big Salad."" George hopes to acquire a little ego boost by treating Elaine to lunch. At the coffee shop, George's girlfriend Julie (Michelle Forbes) grabs the to-go package and then hands it off without noting who had made the actual purchase. When George later tries to get credit, Elaine cannot understand why he needs her thanks, and when Julie learns that George made a big deal about the salad, she is so annoyed that she walks out of his life. But George has hit on a heretofore unarticulated truth: the person who delivers the gift, not the person generous enough to have paid, gets the undeserved glory.Why does neither woman understand George's desire for acknowledgement? Both are attractive, and the many admiring glances they get each day reinforce their egos. Elaine draws attention for being cute and flirty; Julie is big-city beautiful, her confidence and sophistication more smartly coordinated than her clothes. George, on the other hand, is short, pudgy, and bald. He needs acknowledgement for that salad because no one is eyeing his physical appearance with appreciation. So give the poor boy a break, girls, and pump him up a little! If his ego psi drops below 6 percent, he could blow like an underinflated tire.In matters of physical harm, the judicial system will not entertain ignorance of the law as an excuse, for it has collected codes and rules in accessible books. But when intangible egos are at stake, we do not have a set of legally-binding documents that tell us how to behave. Are we wrong to re-gift or even de-gift? Must we kiss hello? When is it okay to date the girlfriend's roommate? Season 6 addresses these and other potentially ego-damaging situations to help educate us all.",4,Better Than Miss Manners,1271203200,"04 14, 2010",2010,5973,"['What', 'Seinfeld', 'do', 'best',
