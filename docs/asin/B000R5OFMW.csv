Yes it was a mix of Beauty Shop and Barber Shop rolled in one but it also had a lot of uplifting messages. I really did want to see Terrance Howard's character a little more but the other actors really held it down. The gay guy in the Shop Dee-Dee was a trip. I loved Vivica's short hair cut it fits her well.

I liked it and found loads of laughs, and enjoyed the conversations about civil rights, and why black men are attracted to white women. One of Jenny's longtime workers has to punch out the pimp in the end after he was pushing around his working prostitutes.  Even the meek hair stylist finally stands up to her man.

1079192,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000R5OFMW,Roland E. Zwick,"[5, 5]","**1/2It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that ""The Salon"" is really just ""Barbershop"" on estrogen.  Like that earlier prototype, ""The Salon"" - which takes place in a Baltimore beauty parlor run by the beautiful Vivica A. Fox - is essentially a freeform series of conversations held together by the flimsiest of plot devices (in this one, an unfeeling bureaucracy wants to tear down the shop to make way for a parking lot).  Unfortunately, ""The Salon"" is a pretty wan imitation of the original, lacking the stinging wit and biting social commentary that made ""Barbershop"" such a crossover success in its time.While there is a certain liveliness to the verbal jousting and a notable energy in most of the performances, the comic banter often comes across as catty and mean-spirited rather than funny and insightful. The screenplay by Mark Brown (adapted from the stage play by Shelley Garrett) works overtime trying to be clever and smart about race relations, sexual issues, and life in the African American community, but it really isn't telling us anything we haven't heard countless times before in films on those same topics.  Moreover, the characters themselves often verge on the stereotypical (with the prancing gay hair stylist as probably the most egregious and offensive example).  And to top it all off, the movie is saddled with an ending that is, perhaps, the worst case of a deus ex machina in any film in recent memory.There are indeed some genuinely touching scenes embedded in all the brazen one-liners and zingers, and there are a few laugh-out-loud moments when the sassiness and sarcasm manage to hit the comic bull`s-eye at which the writer is aiming.  But more often than not, the humor misses its mark and falls harmlessly onto the hair-covered floor.The actors give their all to the material and it really isn't their fault that the movie itself fails to catch fire.  Even brief appearances by Garrett Morris and Terence Howard aren`t enough to lift it out of the doldrums.With ""The Salon,"" the ladies finally get the chance to have their say, but they're going to have to do a whole lot better than a second-rate, distaff copy of  ""Barbershop"" if they ever hope to get their message across.",2,"""Barbershop 3""?",1194998400,"11 14, 2007",2007,2227,"['**1/2It', ""n't"", 'take', 'rocket', 'scientist', 'figure', 'out', 'Salon', 'really', 'just', 'Barbershop', 'estrogen', 'earlier', 'prototype', 'Salon', 'place', 'Baltimore', 'beauty', 'parlor', 'run', 'beautiful', 'Vivica', 'A', 'Fox', 'essentially', 'freeform', 'series', 'conversations', 'held', 'together', 'flimsiest', 'plot', 'devices', 'one', 'unfeeling', 'bureaucracy', 'tear', 'down', 'shop', 'make', 'way', 'parking', 'lot', 'Unfortunately', 'Salon', 'pretty', 'wan', 'imitation', 'original', 'lacking', 'stinging', 'wit', 'biting', 'social', 'commentary', 'made', 'Barbershop', 'such', 'crossover', 'success', 'time.While', 'certain', 'liveliness', 'verbal', 'jousting', 'notable', 'energy', 'most', 'performances', 'comic', 'banter', 'often', 'across', 'catty', 'mean-spirited', 'rather', 'funny', 'insightful', 'screenplay', 'Mark', 'Brown', 'adapted', 'stage', 'play', 'Shelley', 'Garrett', 'overtime', 'trying', 'be', 'clever', 'smart', 'race', 'relations', 'sexual', 'issues', 'life', 'African', 'American', 'community', 'really', ""n't"", 'telling', 'anything', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'countless', 'times', 'films', 'same', 'topics', 'Moreover', 'characters', 'often', 'verge', 'stereotypical', 'prancing', 'gay', 'hair', 'stylist', 'probably', 'most', 'egregious', 'offensive', 'example', 'top', 'off', 'movie', 'saddled', 'ending', 'perhaps', 'worst', 'case', 'deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'film', 'recent', 'are', 'indeed', 'genuinely', 'touching', 'scenes', 'embedded', 'brazen', 'one-liners', 'zingers', 'are', 'few', 'laugh-out-loud', 'moments', 'when', 'sassiness', 'sarcasm', 'manage', 'hit', 'comic', 'bull', 's-eye', 'writer', 'aiming', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'humor', 'mark', 'harmlessly', 'hair-covered', 'floor.The', 'actors', 'give', 'material', 'really', ""n't"", 'fault', 'movie', 'catch', 'fire', 'Even', 'brief', 'appearances', 'Garrett', 'Morris', 'Terence', 'Howard', 'aren', 't', 'enough', 'lift', 'doldrums.With', 'Salon', 'ladies', 'finally', 'get', 'chance', 'have', 'say', ""'re"", 'going', 'have', 'do', 'whole', 'lot', 'better', 'second-rate', 'distaff', 'copy', 'Barbershop', 'ever', 'hope', 'get', 'message']",The Salon

I was at blockbuster and it was checked out for a minute. When i finally got it I swear the first five minutes I fell out laughin!!! It's sorta like watching ""comic view"" with a ""soul food"" esque ""beauty shop"" twist. (I won't give it away but the donut scene in the first two minutes was SOOOO FUNNY. It's the comedian that played the aunt in Next Friday.)Why you should buy this movie? It's too funny. The prostitutes, the girl fight, it's a very good film. Most recent black movies that I've seen have been sub par for straight to video. I mean typically at film school you should learn about change of lighting and editing, and some movies get it right and some DON'T. This movie gets 95% of making a movie right. Only two or 3 scenes make you go ""huhhhh"" in the movie b/c somethign doesn't add up, buttttttt they're minor just go with it! But definitely a great movie that probably didn't get the distribution/capital it needed to hit the theaters (and yeah this one's that good)Ummmm Vivica Fox is in it, good role for her and Darrin's dance grooves (from Soul Food t.v. show. that fine man) is in it as well. You should recognize a lot of the cast. Terrance from Hustle and Flow and Mary J. Blige ""Be Without you"" video is in it. And the girl from Gang or Roses and Sister Act 2 is in it(it was cool but it wasn't all that)The dude that played DeDe the gay guy needs to get an award, because i was laughin' my butt off!!!When you're done with this movie check out ""Who made the potato salad"" with Jaleel White (Urkel from Family matters. he's looking fiiinnnneee in that movie)",5,Oh my goosssshhh TOO FUNNY,1189987200,"09 17, 2007",2007,1677,"['have', 'got', 'rent', 'better', 'yet', 'spread', 'word', 'movie', 'out', 'BUY', 'IT', 'was', 'blockbuster', 'was', 'checked', 'out', 'minute', 'When', 'i', 'finally', 'got', 'swear', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'fell', 'out', 'laughin', 'sorta', 'watching', 'comic', 'view', 'soul', 'food', 'esque', 'beauty', 'shop', 'twist', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'donut', 'scene', 'first', 'two', 'minutes', 'was', 'SOOOO', 'FUNNY', 'comedian', 'played', 'aunt', 'Next', 'Friday', 'Why', 'should', 'buy', 'movie', 'too', 'funny', 'prostitutes', 'girl', 'fight', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'Most', 'recent', 'black', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'have', 'been', 'sub', 'par', 'straight', 'video', 'mean', 'typically', 'film', 'school', 'should', 'learn', 'change', 'lighting', 'editing', 'movies', 'get', 'right', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'movie', '95', '%', 'making', 'movie', 'right', 'Only', 'two', '3', 'scenes', 'make', 'go', 'huhhhh', 'movie', 'b/c', 'somethign', ""n't"", 'add', 'up', ""'re"", 'minor', 'just', 'go', 'definitely', 'great', 'movie', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'distribution/capital', 'needed', 'hit', 'theaters', 'yeah', 'one', 'good', 'Ummmm', 'Vivica', 'Fox', 'good', 'role', 'Darrin', 'dance', 'grooves', 'Soul', 'Food', 't.v', 'show', 'fine', 'man', 'as', 'well', 'should', 'recognize', 'lot', 'cast', 'Terrance', 'Hustle', 'Flow', 'Mary', 'J.', 'Blige', 'Be', 'video', 'girl', 'Gang', 'Roses', 'Sister', 'Act', '2', 'was', 'cool', 'was', ""n't"", 'dude', 'played', 'DeDe', 'gay', 'guy', 'get', 'award', 'i', 'was', 'laughin', 'butt', 'off', 'When', ""'re"", 'done', 'movie', 'check', 'Who', 'made', 'potato', 'salad', 'Jaleel', 'White', 'Urkel', 'Family', 'matters', 'looking', 'fiiinnnneee', 'movie']",The Salon
