Seen it came to my memory all the good and odd situation that I lived on those forgotten days. Looking a young Cuba Gooding Jr. in a good performance and of course the hero, leading by James Marshall, when the innocence of those days was to wait for the good boy to take care of the problem and resolve them at the end of the movie, with no special or cg effects, but with a real acting, this movie was an icon for me.In the technical issues the sound is not good for this kind of media, I guess there isn't an improvement method in the way, is regretful cos it will make a difference in the movie, but the quality of the image and photography is very good.

I was very pleased and enjoyed the movie. It's nothing serious like the first two Rocky movies, but light hearted action fun. It pretty quick paced so you don't get bored. I'd compare it more to being similar to Rocky IV in terms of pacing. The story is simple enough about a young, white boxer who, through a turn of bad luck, finds himself in the poorhouse and has to box to settle his dad's gambling debts. The acting is believable unlike the recent Star Wars Attack of the Clones fiasco. Cuba Gooding and James Marshall both put in great performances. The boxing, although a little over the top sometimes,is still great to see although I'd like to have seen longer training sequences. The quality of the dvd picture is great as well. What they don't mention on Amazon's techincal data is that the dvd has both a widescreen and standard full format presentation on either side of the disc so you can watch the movie whatever way you want. I'd definitely recommend this disc for the boxing movie enthusiast.",4,Good fun boxing movie..,1028332800,"08 3, 2002",2002,1093,"['seeing', 'reviews', 'decided', 'go', 'ahead', 'buy', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'very', 'pleased', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'nothing', 'serious', 'first', 'two', 'Rocky', 'movies', 'light', 'hearted', 'action', 'fun', 'pretty', 'quick', 'paced', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'bored', ""'d"", 'compare', 'more', 'being', 'similar', 'Rocky', 'IV', 'terms', 'pacing', 'story', 'simple', 'enough', 'young', 'white', 'boxer', 'who', 'turn', 'bad', 'luck', 'poorhouse', 'box', 'settle', 'dad', 'gambling', 'debts', 'acting', 'believable', 'recent', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Attack', 'Clones', 'fiasco', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'James', 'Marshall', 'put', 'great', 'performances', 'boxing', 'little', 'top', 'sometimes', 'still', 'great', 'see', ""'d"", 'like', 'have', 'seen', 'longer', 'training', 'sequences', 'quality', 'dvd', 'picture', 'great', 'as', 'well', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'mention', 'Amazon', 'techincal', 'data', 'dvd', 'widescreen', 'standard', 'full', 'format', 'presentation', 'side', 'disc', 'can', 'watch', 'movie', 'way', 'want', ""'d"", 'definitely', 'recommend', 'disc', 'boxing', 'movie', 'enthusiast']",N/A

Yet, at the bottom of those lists, you may just find this little gem that you've never heard of.  If you are a fan of pugilistic big-screen experiences, this is one that at the very least will keep you entertained.For a basic plot summary, &#34;Gladiator&#34; tells the story of Tommy Riley (James Marshall), a white teenage youngster who (via parental circumstances) is moved into an all-black school and neighborhood.  After having enough of the constant bullying and needing money badly, Tommy is recruited into a shady boxing circuit by Pappy Jack (Robert Loggia).  After befriending similar hard-luck case Lincoln Haines (Cuba Gooding Jr.), Tommy runs headlong into &#34;big boss&#34; Jimmy Horn (Brian Dennehy) when a huge conflict of interest rises between them.&#34;Gladiator&#34;, in terms of themes, is about as simple a movie as ever was made.  I remember watching it off television as a kid and even then being about to follow the themes.  While that simplicity keeps it from being a classic, it also makes sure that the movie ages pretty well.  Whether you watching this movie in theaters in 1992 or on your flat-screen in 2014, it plays pretty much the same.Perhaps what shines most from this movie, though, is the performance by Brian Dennehy.  That is what I remembered most from the original viewing and what drew me towards finding it again.  Along the way, though, I noticed great performances from Gooding Jr. and Ossie Davis as well.If you are not a fan of boxing movies, I would say you can probably skip this one, as without an appreciate of the boxing-related themes the rest of the narrative will be a bit too simplistic to hold your interest.  If you love the &#34;sweet science&#34;, though, this one will at least entertain you with some drama and adversity themes.",4,An Underrated Effort In The Boxing Film Cannon,1398470400,"04 26, 2014",2014,1920,"['Type', '34', 'Gladiator', '34', 'search', 'engine', 'movies', ""'ll"", 'get', 'pages', 'pages', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'gladiator', 'epic', 'bottom', 'lists', 'may', 'just', 'find', 'little', 'gem', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'are', 'fan', 'pugilistic', 'big-screen', 'experiences', 'one', 'very', 'least', 'will', 'keep', 'entertained.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', '34', 'Gladiator', '34', 'story', 'Tommy', 'Riley', 'James', 'Marshall', 'white', 'teenage', 'youngster', 'who', 'parental', 'circumstances', 'moved', 'all-black', 'school', 'neighborhood', 'having', 'enough', 'constant', 'bullying', 'needing', 'money', 'badly', 'Tommy', 'recruited', 'shady', 'boxing', 'circuit', 'Pappy', 'Jack', 'Robert', 'Loggia', 'befriending', 'similar', 'hard-luck', 'case', 'Lincoln', 'Haines', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'Tommy', 'headlong', '34', 'big', 'boss', '34', 'Jimmy', 'Horn', 'Brian', 'Dennehy', 'when', 'huge', 'conflict', 'interest', 'rises', 'them.', '34', 'Gladiator', '34', 'terms', 'themes', 'about', 'as', 'simple', 'movie', 'ever', 'was', 'made', 'remember', 'watching', 'off', 'television', 'kid', 'even', 'then', 'being', 'follow', 'themes', 'simplicity', 'being', 'classic', 'also', 'sure', 'movie', 'pretty', 'well', 'Whether', 'watching', 'movie', 'theaters', '1992', 'flat-screen', '2014', 'pretty', 'much', 'same.Perhaps', 'what', 'most', 'movie', 'performance', 'Brian', 'Dennehy', 'what', 'remembered', 'most', 'original', 'viewing', 'what', 'drew', 'finding', 'again', 'way', 'noticed', 'great', 'performances', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'Ossie', 'Davis', 'well.If', 'are', 'not', 'fan', 'boxing', 'movies', 'would', 'say', 'can', 'probably', 'skip', 'one', 'appreciate', 'boxing-related', 'themes', 'rest', 'narrative', 'will', 'be', 'bit', 'too', 'simplistic', 'hold', 'interest', 'love', '34', 'sweet', 'science', '34', 'though', 'one', 'will', 'least', 'entertain', 'drama', 'adversity', 'themes']",N/A
