900013,A1TO1P3NV7OAU6,B00092A1LM,"KevinB ""The Honey Badger""","[1, 1]","Daisuke's class has left for a seaside resort. I don't know why, but it makes a romantic backdrop for the events that unfold. While there, Daisuke discovers his true feelings. Beside the Ocean and under shooting stars he confesses his love to a special girl. His feelings are returned this time, and he has someone important to fight for. Upon returning, the class decides to put on a play. During this episode, Daisuke is trapped inside the painting that he gave to Riku. Dark must go in to save him. There has been a strong magic spell placed on the painting. I think it's from the necklaces that Mio has given to Riku.This is a pretty good DVD. I'm much happier with this series now that Daisuke has wised up and chosen the better girl to be with. The only problem is, when you have someone you have to protect, drama tends to rear its head. Satoshi is also dealing with some drama of his own. His adopted Father is put out with him and is putting his own plans into effect. The end is drawing near, and this story is getting really good.",5,The Best Volume Yet,1356220800,"12 23, 2012",2012,1041,"['Daisuke', 'class', 'left', 'seaside', 'resort', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'romantic', 'backdrop', 'events', 'unfold', 'there', 'Daisuke', 'true', 'feelings', 'Ocean', 'shooting', 'stars', 'love', 'special', 'girl', 'feelings', 'are', 'returned', 'time', 'someone', 'important', 'fight', 'returning', 'class', 'put', 'play', 'episode', 'Daisuke', 'trapped', 'painting', 'gave', 'Riku', 'Dark', 'must', 'go', 'save', 'been', 'strong', 'magic', 'spell', 'placed', 'painting', 'think', 'necklaces', 'Mio', 'given', 'Riku.This', 'pretty', 'good', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'much', 'happier', 'series', 'now', 'Daisuke', 'wised', 'up', 'chosen', 'better', 'girl', 'be', 'only', 'problem', 'when', 'have', 'someone', 'have', 'protect', 'drama', 'rear', 'head', 'Satoshi', 'also', 'dealing', 'drama', 'own', 'adopted', 'Father', 'put', 'out', 'putting', 'own', 'plans', 'effect', 'end', 'drawing', 'story', 'getting', 'really', 'good']",N/A

Bryant ""Webmaster of OtakuReview.net""","[0, 0]","Coming back to this series and picking up where I left off made me worried that I wouldn't be able to enjoy it as much as I used to but those fears were quickly put to rest. Even after losing track of this series, I still remembered the characters and what role they played in the series which goes to show how strong of an impact it made two years ago. While this volume isn't the greatest example of what this series can be, the final two volumes have me excited to keep going and finally see what happens to Daisuke and Dark Mousy.",4,Pickin One Back Up,1213920000,"06 20, 2008",2008,534,"['Coming', 'back', 'series', 'picking', 'up', 'where', 'left', 'off', 'made', 'worried', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'enjoy', 'as', 'much', 'used', 'fears', 'were', 'quickly', 'put', 'rest', 'Even', 'losing', 'track', 'series', 'still', 'remembered', 'characters', 'what', 'role', 'played', 'series', 'show', 'how', 'strong', 'impact', 'made', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'volume', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'example', 'what', 'series', 'can', 'be', 'final', 'two', 'volumes', 'have', 'excited', 'keep', 'going', 'finally', 'see', 'what', 'Daisuke', 'Dark', 'Mousy']",N/A

So if you care at all about the characters, I would make sure you have Volume 6 handy!This DVD contains episodes, or ""stages"" 17 through 20.Episode 17: A Summer Without Dark - For some reason, the whole school goes to a resort.Episode 18: The Two on the Night of Falling Stars - They are supposed to have supervised activities, but Daisuke and Rika manage to spend the entire day exploring alone.Episode 19: A Wonderful Heroine - Daisuke is chosen as the female lead in the his class's play for the Cultural Festival.  And his male co-star is Satoshi.  The girls in the class go ape over the shounen-ai.  The story of the play is very serious and depressing for a school play, however.Episode 20: I Want to Meet You - We learn the truth about why Mio Hio has come to Daisuke's school.  This episode ends with a bang.The extras on this DVD are good.  We have an interview with an American voice actress and the ADV animation director, another interview with the Japanese voice actor who plays Dai and the man who plays and sings the theme song.  In this segment, they answer a number of questions about comparisons between themselves and the DNA characters.",3,Ends With a Huge Cliffhanger,1140739200,"02 24, 2006",2006,1253,"['wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'what', 'last', 'episode', 'something', 'happens', 'are', 'left', 'hanging', 'So', 'care', 'characters', 'would', 'make', 'sure', 'have', 'Volume', '6', 'handy', 'DVD', 'episodes', 'stages', '17', '20.Episode', '17', 'Summer', 'Without', 'Dark', 'reason', 'whole', 'school', 'resort.Episode', '18', 'Two', 'Night', 'Falling', 'Stars', 'are', 'supposed', 'have', 'supervised', 'activities', 'Daisuke', 'Rika', 'manage', 'spend', 'entire', 'day', 'exploring', 'alone.Episode', '19', 'Wonderful', 'Heroine', 'Daisuke', 'chosen', 'female', 'lead', 'class', 'play', 'Cultural', 'Festival', 'male', 'co-star', 'Satoshi', 'girls', 'class', 'go', 'ape', 'shounen-ai', 'story', 'play', 'very', 'serious', 'depressing', 'school', 'play', 'however.Episode', '20', 'Want', 'Meet', 'learn', 'truth', 'why', 'Mio', 'Hio', 'come', 'Daisuke', 'school', 'episode', 'bang.The', 'extras', 'DVD', 'are', 'good', 'have', 'interview', 'American', 'voice', 'actress', 'ADV', 'animation', 'director', 'interview', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'actor', 'who', 'Dai', 'man', 'who', 'theme', 'song', 'segment', 'answer', 'number', 'questions', 'comparisons', 'DNA', 'characters']",N/A
