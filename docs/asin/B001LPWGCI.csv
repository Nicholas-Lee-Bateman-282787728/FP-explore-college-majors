For those of you out there in doubt about it, or maybe put off by its theme of ""handicapped people"" rising above their circumstances, or friendship and its rough patches, don't be. Give this classic a try. I guarantee after five minutes you'll be hooked.Although some may think it's going to be depressing after witnessing the beginning, it's not. It continues to climb uphill and finishes with a crowd-pleasing coda that still brings a smile to my face. I watched it last night for the first time since the 80s and time has not diminished it. Although David Morse has probably had the most commercial success in film and television since this film's release, it's John Savage as Roary who is the heart and soul of this film. Every feeling he has seems to be etched in his face, and his growth from failed suicide to successful businessman and great friend to all is a wonder to behold. Even though Savage has kept busy, he never seemed to hit the heights he had with this film, and The Deer Hunter.There are a thousand things I could say about this film, but it would be unfair to first-time viewers.

The power of this film is in it's simplicity; a film about positive people who refuse to let life's slings 'n arrows get the best of them. Laughter is the best medicine, and the characters make no question that, despite their affirmities, they're glad to be alive. It's also a film about fond friendship, and about budding love; that honesty and sincerity are precious virtues that make relationships grow and become real. John Savage is appealing, and David Morse is very fine in a complicated, many-layered role. They center this film, and the simple basis of their fond friendship is well explored. Oscar nominated Diana Scarwid is outstanding inasmuch as she is ever-present, yet keeps it simple and focused. No histrionics or outrageous over-the-top carrying on. A sweet, appealing character.I can't imagine anyone not being moved by this film. Oscar-winner Harold Russell is on hand as a member of the ensemble buddy group. I won't blab away the plot, but if there was a bar like that in my neighborhood, I'd be there a lot. Director Richard Donner, after the success of ""Superman"", turned the tables and kept everything so low-key, yet intense; riveting.

1215518,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,B001LPWGCI,Robert Morris,"[28, 28]","Note: This review was written quite a while ago. At that time, it was almost impossible to see this film. Fortunately, a DVD version is now available. So I have revised the otiginal review accordingly.To say it this is a ""small"" film in no way questions its several achievements. The screenplay (co-authored by Valerie Curtin and Barry Levinson), direction (Richard Donner), acting, and cinematography (Laszlo Kovacs) are outstanding. Inside Moves is based on Todd Walton`s novel and focuses on Max's Bar in Oakland; more specifically, on those who work there and its regular customers. All of them are emotionally and/or physically handicapped and yet, once gathered together -- in what is in many ways a sanctuary for them -- they generously provide comfort and support to each other. It is also worth noting that the regulars have zero-tolerance of self-pity, theirs or anyone else's.After a failed suicide attempt which has left him permanently crippled, Roary (John Savage) joins the group with apprehensions. Over time, he begins to work at the bar and later becomes its owner. He and Louise (a waitress portrayed brilliantly by Diana Scarwid) have a mutual attraction which eventually overcomes their self-doubts as well as their fear of being hurt again. The bartender, Jerry Maxwell (David Morse), was once a basketball prodigy but is now a cripple also, unable to afford the cost of corrective surgery. He is involved with a juvenile drug addict named Ann (Amy Wright) who supports her addiction with money earned as a prostitute. Although my remarks thus far may suggest that this is a ""dark"" film, it really isn't. ""Touching,"" ""intimate,"" and ""moving"" (no pun intended) more accurately describe its impact, at least on me.Oh sure, it has some corny moments. I also agree with others who question the plausibility of Jerry's transition from limping bartender to making the squad of the Golden State Warriors. (I could also do without the subplot which involves him, Ann, and her pimp.) That said, I still think this is a fine film. Credit Donner with assembling a strong supporting cast (notably Harold Russell. Bill Henderson, and Harold Sylvester) and then carefully integrating their performances with those of Savage, Morse, and Scarwid. The musical score is appropriately, indeed cleverly coordinated with the plot's development. I also appreciate the selective use of humor within a culture which might otherwise seem hopelessly dysfunctional. Affection and respect between and among the characters are genuine. Granted, the film's ""happy ending"" is predictable. Given what all of the lead characters have endured prior to it, however, who can deny them the smiles on their faces? Not I.",5,"A neglected gem, finally available",1096329600,"09 28, 2004",2004,2704,"['Note', 'review', 'was', 'written', 'quite', 'while', 'ago', 'time', 'was', 'almost', 'impossible', 'see', 'film', 'Fortunately', 'DVD', 'version', 'now', 'available', 'So', 'have', 'revised', 'otiginal', 'review', 'accordingly.To', 'say', 'small', 'film', 'way', 'questions', 'several', 'achievements', 'screenplay', 'co-authored', 'Valerie', 'Curtin', 'Barry', 'Levinson', 'direction', 'Richard', 'Donner', 'acting', 'cinematography', 'Laszlo', 'Kovacs', 'are', 'outstanding', 'Inside', 'Moves', 'based', 'Todd', 'Walton', 's', 'novel', 'focuses', 'Max', 'Bar', 'Oakland', 'more', 'specifically', 'who', 'work', 'there', 'regular', 'customers', 'are', 'emotionally', 'and/or', 'physically', 'handicapped', 'yet', 'once', 'gathered', 'together', 'what', 'many', 'ways', 'sanctuary', 'generously', 'provide', 'comfort', 'support', 'other', 'also', 'worth', 'noting', 'regulars', 'have', 'zero-tolerance', 'self-pity', 'anyone', ""else's.After"", 'failed', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'left', 'permanently', 'crippled', 'Roary', 'John', 'Savage', 'group', 'apprehensions', 'time', 'work', 'bar', 'later', 'owner', 'Louise', 'waitress', 'portrayed', 'brilliantly', 'Diana', 'Scarwid', 'have', 'mutual', 'attraction', 'eventually', 'self-doubts', 'as', 'well', 'fear', 'being', 'hurt', 'again', 'bartender', 'Jerry', 'Maxwell', 'David', 'Morse', 'was', 'once', 'basketball', 'prodigy', 'now', 'cripple', 'also', 'unable', 'afford', 'cost', 'corrective', 'surgery', 'involved', 'juvenile', 'drug', 'addict', 'named', 'Ann', 'Amy', 'Wright', 'who', 'addiction', 'money', 'earned', 'prostitute', 'remarks', 'thus', 'far', 'may', 'suggest', 'dark', 'film', 'really', ""n't"", 'Touching', 'intimate', 'moving', 'pun', 'intended', 'more', 'accurately', 'describe', 'impact', 'least', 'me.Oh', 'sure', 'corny', 'moments', 'also', 'agree', 'others', 'who', 'question', 'plausibility', 'Jerry', 'transition', 'limping', 'bartender', 'making', 'squad', 'Golden', 'State', 'Warriors', 'could', 'also', 'do', 'subplot', 'Ann', 'pimp', 'said', 'still', 'think', 'fine', 'film', 'Credit', 'Donner', 'assembling', 'strong', 'supporting', 'cast', 'notably', 'Harold', 'Russell', 'Bill', 'Henderson', 'Harold', 'Sylvester', 'then', 'carefully', 'integrating', 'performances', 'Savage', 'Morse', 'Scarwid', 'musical', 'score', 'appropriately', 'indeed', 'cleverly', 'coordinated', 'plot', 'development', 'also', 'appreciate', 'selective', 'use', 'humor', 'culture', 'might', 'otherwise', 'seem', 'hopelessly', 'dysfunctional', 'Affection', 'respect', 'characters', 'are', 'genuine', 'Granted', 'film', 'happy', 'ending', 'predictable', 'Given', 'what', 'lead', 'characters', 'have', 'endured', 'prior', 'however', 'who', 'can', 'deny', 'smiles', 'Not']",N/A
