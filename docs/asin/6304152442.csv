Then when I found the script ""Night Must Fall : a Play in Three Acts [Kindle Edition]"" and saw that there was a 1937 film version with Dame May Whitty, Rosalind Russell, and Robert Montgomery. I was mesmerized into buying a copy.I knew the play but had to see how it played out in this remastered film. I was not disappointed. Now people that are more interested discovering for their selves who-dun-it will be disappointed as the play is more of a psychological thriller and more interested in people's reactions to each other. You may find the movie to be more rounded than the play but very close.It was well acted and well paced; as you get sucked into the story you forget that it is just a play and you find yourself kibitzing.The basic story is that a woman went missing from a nearby hotel. Naturally people suspect foul play. A suspicious worker from the hotel now comes to worm his way into the good graces of a rich widow. We know who everyone suspects (probably a red herring.) My money is on the lawyer as you know how they are. But watch and decide for yourself.After you are finished watching it for the first time watch again and see what you missed while speculation on who-dun-it.

Slipman,"[3, 7]","""Night Must Fall"" an offbeat murder thriller set in the English countryside had potential to be intriguing but was plagued by uneven acting performances.Robert Montgomery does fairly well tackling a role that was different from those he had previously played to this point in his career.  Playing the psychopathic hotel page Danny, he shows up at the house of the wealthy old and cantankerous Mrs. Bramson simultaneous to a police investigation of a local woman's disappearance.  Under the guise of courting the old woman's maid, he immediately ingratiates himself to the aged gal played marvelously by septagenarian Dame May Witty.  She hires him to work in the house and be her companion much to the consternation of her niece and caretaker Olivia.  Olivia played is an amazingly wooden performance by Rosalind Russell is strangely attracted by Montgomery but is fearful of his diabolical nature.Montgomery while getting on Witty's good side is suspicious.  We are fed clues by director Richard Thorpe to give us insight into the devious nature of Montgomery's personality.  The audience along with Russell are led to believe that he was responsible for the missing woman whose headless corpse is found just feet away from Dame Witty's property.  The two faced Montgomery has something else up his sleeve but we have to wait until the climax to learn what that will be.",3,Peculiar murder mystery,1133913600,"12 7, 2005",2005,1371,"['Night', 'Must', 'Fall', 'offbeat', 'murder', 'thriller', 'set', 'English', 'countryside', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'intriguing', 'was', 'plagued', 'uneven', 'acting', 'performances.Robert', 'Montgomery', 'fairly', 'well', 'tackling', 'role', 'was', 'different', 'had', 'previously', 'played', 'point', 'career', 'Playing', 'psychopathic', 'hotel', 'page', 'Danny', 'up', 'house', 'wealthy', 'old', 'cantankerous', 'Mrs.', 'Bramson', 'simultaneous', 'police', 'investigation', 'local', 'woman', 'disappearance', 'guise', 'courting', 'old', 'woman', 'maid', 'immediately', 'aged', 'gal', 'played', 'marvelously', 'septagenarian', 'Dame', 'May', 'Witty', 'work', 'house', 'be', 'companion', 'much', 'consternation', 'niece', 'caretaker', 'Olivia', 'Olivia', 'played', 'amazingly', 'wooden', 'performance', 'Rosalind', 'Russell', 'strangely', 'attracted', 'Montgomery', 'fearful', 'diabolical', 'nature.Montgomery', 'getting', 'Witty', 'good', 'side', 'suspicious', 'are', 'fed', 'clues', 'director', 'Richard', 'Thorpe', 'give', 'insight', 'devious', 'nature', 'Montgomery', 'personality', 'audience', 'Russell', 'are', 'led', 'believe', 'was', 'responsible', 'missing', 'woman', 'headless', 'corpse', 'found', 'just', 'feet', 'away', 'Dame', 'Witty', 'property', 'two', 'faced', 'Montgomery', 'something', 'else', 'sleeve', 'have', 'wait', 'climax', 'learn', 'what', 'will', 'be']",Night Must Fall VHS
404366,A2ZY49IDE6TY5I,6304152442,"Crabigail Cassidy ""Crabby Abby""","[3, 3]","This is an often forgotten film that pops up occasionally on TCM in the morning. It is one of my favorite thrillers from MGM from back in the day when MGM ruled Hollywood with 'more stars than they have in the heavens' or something to that effect.It falls into a category of extreme thrillers of the era which also includes The Red House, The Two Mrs. Carrolls, The Night of the Hunter, and Cape Fear where psychotic leads rule the roost.Based on a stage play but well translated for film, it is a cat and mouse game about an amoral psychotic killer named Danny. Played with a lot of amiable charm by pretty boy/ faux leading man Robert Montgomery, in a lot of ways it really showcased Montgomery's wide range of emotions and was the perfect vehicle for him to show off. As Danny, he is charming, endearing,affable, cuddly, insidious, threatening, and all out psycho terrifying. He paces his performance to a point of odd perfection as he can shift his character's emotions in a micro second with perfect physical expression.While it is really Montgomery's show, Rosalind Russell comes across in that unique way she is known for. She is intelligent, skeptical, questioning, increasingly suspicicious, and panicky as she starts processing just how dangerous Danny is.Dame May Whitty supports all this as a potential victim as she is cajoled by Danny in his court jester persona being led like a lamb to the slaughter.The remaster of this film is o.k., but I honestly got so into the movie that it almost seemed sort of secondary. I first saw this movie when I was in high school, and thought it was terrific and really creepy.

404367,A1UODWQ2K6DFXT,6304152442,ellafan,"[4, 4]","I just saw this little gem for the first time a few nights ago onTCM. It had been recommended to me by a fellow ""old movies"" maven.Initially,I thought perhaps Mr. Montgomery wasn't exactly ""up"" to the task of playing the creepy,fawning lead,but I was wrong. His creepiness built up slowly until the sound of his smarminess made me cringe.So he did his part. Rosiland Russell played against type in this role. We are used to seeing her as a strong,witty,take-no-prisoners  woman.Here,however,she does an excellent turn as a plain-Jane,timid and unsure of herself around Montgomery's character.Or anyone else's,for that matter. I think she handled her role very well.Perhaps we,who are huge fans  of hers,will forever see her as ""Auntie Mame,"" a role she was born to play.Forget Auntie Mame for a moment, and enjoy one of Russell's early works. The servants are played very well by British actresses whom we have seen in many,many movies.They are wonderful. Now,after all of this praise,I have to tell you that I think Dame May Whitty is the one who not only stole the movie,but she is the one who certainly must have knocked everyone's socks off when this first came out. She plays a really unlikeable old bat,but as another reviewer said here,we really don't want to see her knocked off. My favorite part of the movie is when she gets panicky,screaming and ranting and carrying on.She let herself go off the deep-end,in a very enjoyable,albeit somewhat cringe-inducing manner that was delicious!It must have been fun for her to let her hair down for this role.So..check it out if  you are partial to this type of old movie.

Whitty isn't particularly sick, but she seems to enjoy making everyone around her miserable, especially her niece played by Rosalind Russell.  She takes a liking to Montgomery, unaware what the viewer and Russell have figured out - he's the murderer of a local woman.  I'm not giving away the ending, since it's made clear as the story progresses.  It's not the point of the film.  What this movie does want to do is take you into the mind of a murderer, and given the fact that this was made in the 1930's, it's a pretty surprising approach.  And oddly enough, it's quite suspenseful, since we wait to see what he will do next.  Montgomery is very effective as the psychopath, charm and humour masking something quite dark inside himself.  May Whitty also delivers a terrific performance as the cantankerous woman longing for the attention of a son she doesn't really have.  Russell is OK in her characterization.  Unfortunately, her character is poorly defined and her motives are often unclear, so there's something about her that doesn't add up.

As unpleasant as the old lady is you don't want to see her 'get it' because Montgomery is so charming & persuasive you know in her place you'd be seduced too. It's like haveing a blind date with Ted Bundy. Whitty repeats her stage performace & she's honed it razor sharp.

After seeing him in tux and tails being an idle rich socialite in a dozen movies, Mr. Montgomery really showed his range of talent here.  He was rewarded with an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor for this role.  With his charisma and bad-boy good looks, he makes Ted Bundy look like Winnie The Pooh!  His hip-hop swagger and confidence made it irresistible for Rosalind Russell to want a bit of ""thug love"" in her previously uneventful existence. Montgomery's ""Danny"" showed up that you can never let your guard down because even the nicest next door neighbor can be a homicidal maniac.  Dame May Whitty got caught up because she was a despicable old lady who thought she was pimping everyone with her invalid act.  But, in this case, game recognized game and she got taken in worse than Russell and the two housekeepers.  With no blood and gore (although it is hinted at it with the hat case that Danny carried around as a ""trophy"" like most such killers), this was one of the most psychologically scary flicks that  I've ever seen.  And I have never missed one showing on TCM since 2005.  It's always on the bill when the show honors Montgomery, Russell, or Whitty.  I put this film at the top of my all-time favorites but I refuse to buy it on VHS.  It deserves a DVD digitally restored ""Special Edition"" and I would buy it at any price to add to my DVD collection of old classics.  I could just get it on VHS and convert it to DVD but you lose so much definition like that.  I just hope, when it does make it to DVD, the film company doesn't screw it up by ""colorizing"" it.

404381,A1WJ1KUYB3RWQN,6304152442,Ripley,"[3, 3]","Watched this on a cable station, and I was very impressed. If I had more hands, I would give this film 10 thumbs up. I kept checking to see who the director was, because this seemed like a Hitchcock movie, in it's suspenseful elements, disturbed and disturbing characters and interactions. Another Hitchcock element is the use of working class characters to produce humorous, insightful commentary on the goings-on in the film. Here the humour comes from two maids who comment on the goings on in the house. The Rosalind Russell character seems to step out of the film noir era. She is not the normal heroine of the murder mysteries of that time. She finds herself drawn to a psychopath who has wormed his way into the employ of her mean spirited aunt. There is some sexual attraction on her part, which is touched on, but in a very subtle manner. I am sure if they remade this film today, it would emphasize the sexual nature of her attraction to this killer, which would reduce this important element of the film to pandering to pruient interests. Instead, the film just hints at it, and it isn't till the middle half of the film that you realize what is happening. This is the advantage that earlier films have over modern ones. Bizarre desires, thoughts, and actions are merely hinted at. In modern films, through imagery, actions, and music, they tend to promote the most disturbing images they can come up with to show a character's or a civilization's moral rot; and this is considered avant garde and edgy. I say it's laziness. It's a lot harder to show a disturbed character by using innuendo and subtlety than it it is to splash it all over the screen so that the filmaker is sure you get the point. A great example of using subtlety to show disturbed characters is in the film ""The Innocents.""

As the North Sea gales were ""stirring aboot"", my cousins and I watched this little flick a few nights back. I must say that Montgomery played his role sincerely and his Irish accent wasn't bad---- yet the film is a just a mite stodgy and a tad too theatrical. As Danny the psychopath, Samantha Stephen's (BEWITCHED) dad was cast very against type (he practically begged Mayer for the part) but amazingly, he pulls it off magnificently (In the thirties, Robert Montgomery was primarily cast as a leading man in light, sophisticated romantic comedies opposite the likes of Crawford and Shearer). Rosalind Russell does okay as Dame May's neice but in her role of the drab repressed spinster, she was hardly in her element! Dame May obviously earned her title. As the invalid (who, in one hilarious scene, gets up out of her wheelchair a la Lucy Ricardo to fetch her box of chocolates!) her playing is quite amazing. Charmed and captivated by Danny, she is glorious when she senses impending doom when she's left all alone - one is emotionally drained just watching! In later years, the actor Richard Ney (Greer Garson married him) acted with Whitty in a picture. At one point Ney said ""alright, Dame May, but I still feel that MY way was the best way"". Whitty replied ""Young man, you haven't GOT a way!!""

404385,A14ADG0TTI4XBV,6304152442,"Scott Coblio ""kookoo guy""","[12, 13]","""Night Must Fall"" is the type of movie that's great to own because you'll watch it a hundred times--it is a ""chicken soup"" type movie which has that intangible something which holds up under repeated viewings without getting tiresome. Perhaps because--as in other ""cult"" movies like ""The Bad Seed"", ""Streetcar Named Desire"", ""Suddenly Last Summer"" and ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane""--it is a wee bit perverse. Ostensibly a rather conventional ""whodunnit"", ""Night"" surprises the viewer by introducing what must have been in 1937 a radical element--the fascination and attraction that Olivia (Rosalind Russel) feels for a cold blooded murderer (Robert Montgomery). Why is she fascinated and attacted to him? Because she's bored with her repressed existence in an isolated house with her bossy aunt, that's why!  Danny's very dangerousness, although lethal, is apparently just the jolt Olivia needs to feel alive again, and she's not ready to give it up right away! So she elects to shield him so that he won't be found out. Because this plot twist was unprecedented then (and scarce in films even today), you'll have a great time watching to see how it all works out. As some reviewers have noted, ""Night Must Fall"" is a bit stagey but as with ""The Bad Seed"", I don't think this hurts it one bit. Like ""Seed"", it WAS a stageplay  (in 1935) and featured many of the same players before being filmed by MGM (interestingly, the play's author Emlyn Williams himself played the role of Danny). It could be said that Russell seems rather wooden in her role as the repressed niece, but this appears to be the way the character is written, as a woman who is emotionally stunted. It's hard to believe, watching her, that this is only two years before ""The Women"" and three years before ""His Girl Friday"". As good as she is however, she finishes third to Dame May Whitty as crochety old Mrs Bramson and Robert Montgomery as Danny, the charming murderer! Dame Whitty devours the scenery with such finesse, and Montgomery is so subtley full of lurking menace (one thinks of Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lector watching him), that poor Rosalind doesn't stand a chance against them! She got her chance in only a few years however.

While the 1930's film can't compare in terms of realism, the two films feature spunky heroines who try to confront and outwit the suave, sexy villain who attempts to read their minds. While Robert Montgomery is no Anthony Hopkins, he possesses a snake-like charm that convinces you that yes, a house full of lonely women (except for the hard-headed cook) would fall instantly under his spell. The scenes in which he insinuates that Russell has a secret lust for him and tries to get her to openly admit it are the most tense in the film.This is Montgomery's tour de force, and he won an Best Actor nomination for the role. Unfortunately, the film itself has not dated well. It suffers from a Hays Code-imposed ending (in the Emlyn Williams play, Olivia never repents of her passion for Danny and it is Danny who admits his guilt, refusing to be indebted to a woman) and the fact that the film embraces a kind of dime-store psychology that was popular in the 1930s but feels very fake and false now.In addition, the film lacks the fluid camera movement one would expect in a thriller and plays more like a drawing room comedy with the intimations of murder sprinkled here and there. Until the end, all of Danny's crimes are hinted at and there are hardly any visuals at all, which would try a modern audience's patience. Director Richard Thorpe clearly had no experience directing thrillers, and one can only dream what kind of film Alfred Hitchcock would have made with it!Despite these limitations, ""Night Must Fall"" is an entertaining film to watch, if only for the way it broke new ground in allowing a handsome leading man (Montgomery) take on such an unappetizing role that 1930s Hollywood usually gave to somebody like Boris Karloff.",4,"Before ""Silence of the Lambs"" There Was...Night Must Fall!",1358985600,"01 24, 2013",2013,1938,"['seeing', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'was', 'struck', 'similarities', 'gutsy', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'character', 'repressed', 'sharp-eyed', 'niece', 'Night', 'Must', 'Fall', 'played', 'Rosalind', 'Russell', '1930', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'terms', 'realism', 'two', 'films', 'feature', 'spunky', 'heroines', 'who', 'try', 'confront', 'outwit', 'suave', 'sexy', 'villain', 'who', 'read', 'minds', 'Robert', 'Montgomery', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'snake-like', 'charm', 'yes', 'house', 'full', 'lonely', 'women', 'hard-headed', 'cook', 'would', 'fall', 'instantly', 'spell', 'scenes', 'Russell', 'secret', 'lust', 'tries', 'get', 'openly', 'admit', 'are', 'most', 'tense', 'film.This', 'Montgomery', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'won', 'Best', 'Actor', 'nomination', 'role', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'not', 'dated', 'well', 'Hays', 'Code-imposed', 'ending', 'Emlyn', 'Williams', 'play', 'Olivia', 'never', 'repents', 'passion', 'Danny', 'Danny', 'who', 'guilt', 'refusing', 'be', 'indebted', 'woman', 'fact', 'film', 'kind', 'dime-store', 'psychology', 'was', 'popular', '1930s', 'feels', 'very', 'fake', 'false', 'now.In', 'addition', 'film', 'fluid', 'camera', 'movement', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'thriller', 'more', 'drawing', 'room', 'comedy', 'intimations', 'murder', 'sprinkled', 'here', 'there', 'end', 'Danny', 'crimes', 'are', 'hinted', 'are', 'hardly', 'visuals', 'would', 'try', 'modern', 'audience', 'patience', 'Director', 'Richard', 'Thorpe', 'clearly', 'had', 'experience', 'directing', 'thrillers', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'dream', 'what', 'kind', 'film', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'limitations', 'Night', 'Must', 'Fall', 'entertaining', 'film', 'watch', 'only', 'way', 'broke', 'new', 'ground', 'allowing', 'handsome', 'leading', 'man', 'Montgomery', 'take', 'unappetizing', 'role', '1930s', 'Hollywood', 'usually', 'gave', 'somebody', 'Boris', 'Karloff']",Night Must Fall VHS

Robert Montgomery plays the narcissistic, handsome madman to the hilt! I wish he'd won the Oscar instead of just being nominated for this one.This movie hits on themes that were incredibly risque at the time. Unwed pregnancy, gigolo (Which is what we might call Danny today), and murder.What's in the hat bag he carries, just that thought of what it might be is creepy enough. There is no humor in this, just cunningly crafted terror! When Dame Whitty screams over and over, &#34;Danny, Danny&#34; it set my nerves on edge. Watch this movie for a good old fashioned thriller,",5,"Great Thiller, A Must See!!!",1403222400,"06 20, 2014",2014,638,"['saw', 'movie', 'TCM', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'good', 'was', 'Robert', 'Montgomery', 'narcissistic', 'handsome', 'madman', 'hilt', 'wish', ""'d"", 'won', 'Oscar', 'instead', 'just', 'being', 'nominated', 'one.This', 'movie', 'hits', 'themes', 'were', 'incredibly', 'risque', 'time', 'Unwed', 'pregnancy', 'gigolo', 'Which', 'what', 'might', 'call', 'Danny', 'today', 'hat', 'bag', 'just', 'thought', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'creepy', 'enough', 'humor', 'just', 'cunningly', 'crafted', 'terror', 'When', 'Dame', 'Whitty', '34', 'Danny', 'Danny', '34', 'set', 'nerves', 'edge', 'Watch', 'movie', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'thriller']",Night Must Fall VHS
