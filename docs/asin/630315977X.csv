I'm sure Macdonald didn't envision his characters breaking into song and dance in the middle.

The story is about the adventurous Princess Irene. The princess is off playing in the woods when she is attacked by goblins pets. She is saved by a mining boy named Curty. They quickly become friends and get into a lot of trouble. The goblins attack and Irene must rely on her own magic to save Curty, and in turn the entire kingdom. (Yes the story has a happy ending ^^ )The story teaches the importance of believing in yourself, friendship, not keeping things inside, and the power of a song. I would recommend this story to any child boy or girl. However, there are a few scary parts in this movie, nothing bad compared to what kids are exposed to these days but I would advise that the parents sit and watch the movie with that child the first time through just in case it doesn't met that parent's pretence. (There is a spot where the ground starting moving at the beginning and a hand comes out and grabs her. Of course she gets away!
