Laura is rough-around-the-edges, she's high-strung, she's neurotic, and can't make sense out of her chaotic life. This film isn't for everyone, no fairytale ending but I did enjoy this film.

1456519,AAZRWLML88IZK,B005EIHMXG,A kids review,"[5, 10]","It's not uncommon for stars of popular television shows to move on to feature films, and the US version of The Office has certainly aided in elevating the careers of several of its actors. After starring on the sitcom as the clever, lovable Pam Beesly, Jenna Fischer began landing parts in high profile comedies, and with A Little Help, she emerges in her first major starring role. Fischer is somewhat neurotic dental hygienist Laura Pehlke, mother to Dennis and wife to philandering Bob. When Bob suddenly dies, Laura is faced with the task of putting her life back together, both for her and her son. Though that synopsis may not clearly indicate it, A Little Help is a dramedy that focuses on its characters' quirky coping methods, and though Fischer makes the best of it that she can, I mostly felt the film was a bit uneven, with a subpar script and some puzzling choices made for its likable lead.",1,A Little Help,1320710400,"11 8, 2011",2011,904,"['not', 'uncommon', 'stars', 'popular', 'television', 'shows', 'move', 'feature', 'films', 'US', 'version', 'Office', 'certainly', 'aided', 'elevating', 'careers', 'several', 'actors', 'starring', 'sitcom', 'clever', 'lovable', 'Pam', 'Beesly', 'Jenna', 'Fischer', 'began', 'landing', 'parts', 'high', 'profile', 'comedies', 'A', 'Little', 'Help', 'first', 'major', 'starring', 'role', 'Fischer', 'somewhat', 'neurotic', 'dental', 'hygienist', 'Laura', 'Pehlke', 'mother', 'Dennis', 'wife', 'philandering', 'Bob', 'When', 'Bob', 'suddenly', 'Laura', 'faced', 'task', 'putting', 'life', 'back', 'together', 'son', 'synopsis', 'may', 'not', 'clearly', 'indicate', 'A', 'Little', 'Help', 'dramedy', 'characters', 'quirky', 'coping', 'methods', 'Fischer', 'best', 'can', 'mostly', 'felt', 'film', 'was', 'bit', 'uneven', 'subpar', 'script', 'puzzling', 'choices', 'made', 'likable', 'lead']",N/A

1456526,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B005EIHMXG,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[4, 6]","Writer/director Michael J. Weithorn, a television sitcom veteran, makes his feature film debut with the slight but likable ""A Little Help."" In truth, his sitcom origins are pretty apparent as many of the film's situations feel a bit forced for comedic or confrontational value--and yet, the film contains a fair share of charming moments as well. This is one of those small independent endeavors that you will either love if you identify with the characters or be generally underwhelmed by its lack of narrative momentum. I, for my part, enjoyed the movie for its unassuming tone and a bold lead performance by Jenna Fischer. Fischer, best known for ""The Office,"" rarely has a chance to display her acting chops but this is certainly a nice showcase. Despite some of the screenplay's shortcomings, this has to have been a dream part for Fischer who is usually relegated to small or benignly generic supporting roles in feature films. Here she gets to act with a capital ""A."" And for my money, that is a primary selling point.Fischer and Chris O'Donnell play a troubled married couple living a typical Long Island existence. When things take a tumultuous turn, Fischer and her son are left to rebuild their lives with the help of her ever-intrusive family. With seasoned vets Leslie Ann Warren and Ron Leibman as her protective (and oftentimes critical) parents and Brooke Smith as a caring (but overbearing) sister, it's a hard road to newly defined independence. Fischer maneuvers through the pratfalls of moving toward maturity and confidence through a series of comedic missteps that seem to be leading her in the right direction. Some of these moments contain genuine emotion, some are lightly amusing, and some are awkwardly strained (come on, does anyone really believe she'd have actively participated in the lie perpetuated at her son's school?). It is the script's unevenness that is perhaps the movie's biggest detriment, but Fischer manages to keep things grounded and on track throughout. In the end, the life lessons might be too understated and barely noticeable to make the journey worthwhile for some viewers--but I didn't mind the film's loose ending.As I said, I quite liked ""A Little Help"" despite my intellectual reservations. It is designed to tug at the heartstrings and I was willing to let Fischer and team manipulate my emotions, even in the less-than-real intrusions. While I did love Fischer, the film is NOT a one woman show either. It has some notable work from a trio of actors that are often overlooked or underutilized. Brooke Smith (often misused) is terrific as the put-upon sister--it might be my favorite performance of hers going all the way back to the criminally underrated ""Series 7."" Rob Benedict (maybe still best known for TV's Felicity), usually playing an oddball or eccentric, gets a sympathetic and well rounded role as Smith's husband who once had a crush on Fischer. And Kim Coates (Prison Break, Sons of Anarchy) scores in a change-of-pace stint as Fischer's aggressive attorney. I appreciated seeing these great actors given a chance to shine! ""A Little Help"" may be a bit slight for its own good, but I genuinely enjoyed this sleeper. Recommended, but a must-see if you love Fischer.

He clearly prefers dad (Chris O'Donnell) who frequently must work late, to being with his mom.Jenna drowns her life, which really isn't that bad, into a Budweiser product placement (later replaced by Absolut Vodka) and lies to her mother (Lesley Ann Warren who has aged gracefully) about her life.

When Chris dies from an ""anxiety"" attack brought on by Laura's sudden sexual demand, Laura goes to work the morning of the day of the funeral because it isn't until three o'clock. When Laura is at home, there are times when a dog is barking in the background. It is cleverly symbolic of her tension level.The movie has some quick dry dark comedy wit:At the funeral Paul is talking to a woman while opening a bottle of wine:Paul: This is my second funeral this year, my dad died earlier.Woman: Oh I'm so sorry.Paul: Don't be.

This is also one of the best mother-son bonding movies I have ever seen, and there are scenes with her family that will make you mad. The fact that you have these feeling marks the sign of a good movie. This is one of the biggest surprise movies of the year. You expect one thing, it's another, but an absolutely fantastic movie to watch. Overall, an extremely entertaining and enjoyable movie to watch that won't disappoint. I give it an A.",4,A wonderful movie about a mother & son bonding after the death of the father. An absolute must see movie. Very good.
