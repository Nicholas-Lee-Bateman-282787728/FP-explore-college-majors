320923,A2582KMXLK2P06,6302571235,B. E Jackson,"[1, 1]","Class Act is about two students who, while during a mix-up involving photos in the secretary's office at their high school, accidentally change roles.One of the teens is a troublemaker who just got out of jail while the other teen is an honor student who gets perfect grades.The troublemaker ends up in the smart class with all the smart kids, while the nerdy kid with an amazingly high IQ level ends up with all the criminals.It pretty much stays like that the entire way through the storyline (mostly because the criminal teen ends up coming into contact with the smart kid and threatens him to NOT change back to normal).However, the storyline is mostly concerned with the school bully who repeatedly threatens to beat up on the smart kid while the criminal kid frequently has to come to his rescue.  Time and time again the school bully tries to pick a fight with the nerdy kid but ultimately fails.The movie is mostly extremely funny for the entire first half (when the criminal kid spends time teaching the nerdy kid how to be cool and hip) but loses steam towards the end when the police chase is underway.Maybe most people would find the film funny the entire time, but I thought it gradually lost momentum near the end.  Plus, right after the halfway point when the two kids fell in love with their girlfriends, these romantic segments dragged on a bit longer than necessary.Other than that, Class Act is pretty funny and holds up well today.  In fact, the movie feels like it holds up better than the majority of films released in the early 90's, perhaps due to high production work.Good film.",4,pretty hilarious,1279756800,"07 22, 2010",2010,1603,"['Class', 'Act', 'two', 'students', 'who', 'mix-up', 'involving', 'photos', 'secretary', 'office', 'high', 'school', 'accidentally', 'change', 'roles.One', 'teens', 'troublemaker', 'who', 'just', 'got', 'jail', 'other', 'teen', 'honor', 'student', 'who', 'perfect', 'grades.The', 'troublemaker', 'up', 'smart', 'class', 'smart', 'kids', 'nerdy', 'kid', 'amazingly', 'high', 'IQ', 'level', 'up', 'criminals.It', 'pretty', 'much', 'stays', 'entire', 'way', 'storyline', 'mostly', 'criminal', 'teen', 'up', 'coming', 'contact', 'smart', 'kid', 'NOT', 'change', 'back', 'normal', '.However', 'storyline', 'mostly', 'concerned', 'school', 'bully', 'who', 'repeatedly', 'beat', 'up', 'smart', 'kid', 'criminal', 'kid', 'frequently', 'come', 'rescue', 'Time', 'time', 'again', 'school', 'bully', 'pick', 'fight', 'nerdy', 'kid', 'ultimately', 'fails.The', 'movie', 'mostly', 'extremely', 'funny', 'entire', 'first', 'half', 'when', 'criminal', 'kid', 'time', 'teaching', 'nerdy', 'kid', 'how', 'be', 'cool', 'hip', 'steam', 'end', 'when', 'police', 'chase', 'underway.Maybe', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'find', 'film', 'funny', 'entire', 'time', 'thought', 'gradually', 'lost', 'momentum', 'end', 'right', 'halfway', 'point', 'when', 'two', 'kids', 'fell', 'love', 'girlfriends', 'romantic', 'segments', 'dragged', 'bit', 'longer', 'necessary.Other', 'Class', 'Act', 'pretty', 'funny', 'up', 'well', 'today', 'fact', 'movie', 'feels', 'up', 'better', 'majority', 'films', 'released', 'early', '90', 'perhaps', 'due', 'high', 'production', 'work.Good', 'film']",N/A

Life can be cold sometimes. Class Act is one of the fond memories I have of the 90s.If you dont already know this movie details The misadventures of Duncan(Kid of Kid N Play) and Blade(Play of Kid N Play). These two get mistaken for each other after in accident in the office and crazy hijinks ensue.The funniest scenes would have to be when Blade is teaching Duncan how to be hip. Meshach Taylor is pretty funny as Duncan's father who thinks that Duncan might be a little sweet. Every time Wedge gets beaten up I laugh and when Rhea Pearlman(who plays Blade's teacher) was hitting on Blade I almost lost my breath laughing so hard. Yeah, its easy to think about what would happen if the mistake had never been made but that would have made for a boring movie.Class Act is one of the funniest movies of 1992 and the fact that it isnt released on DVD while movies that everybody knows are horrible are released on Blu-ray is a crime.

320939,A3UA046AA3DXFD,6302571235,Sid the Elf,"[2, 2]","As you may know by now Sid has a real passion for 90's flicks. Whether it be horror, action, or comedy they all seem to be top notch in that corny b way we just can't get enough of. Class Act is a perfect example of this. It was released in 1992 between House Party 2 & 3. We can only assume that House Party 2 didn't fair too well in the box office and they decided to switch it up a bit before releasing a third House Party installment. If you are a fan of Kid n Play you should know what to expect with this one. Either you'll love it or think it's terrible.This time we get to see Kid as an overachieving genius named Duncan who has a run in with the school delinquent Blade (Play). The school winds up switching their records around forcing them to assume new identities to keep Blade from his pending trouble with the law. As they struggle to get by in their new lives they begin to find the good things about being each other. Duncan gets to be feared by the entire school because they think he's a ruthless thug and Blade is thought of as a genius earning him a little action with Ellen (Hillary from Fresh Prince of Bel Air). Happy times! Of course they get themselves into some trouble and have their usual rap off, this time with a little help from the weasel himself Pauly Shore. It all gets patched up in the end and of course they become best buds to only be seen in House Party 3 one year later.For us you can't help but love this movie. It's Kid n Play! What isn't to love about that? It doesn't quite have the goods House Party has but it's still a solid 90's comedy proving what a fun time that was. It's a shame they can't duplicate any films like this any longer without it being some awful dance hall competition crap. So for those of you out there looking to cheese up you evening Class Act may be the right choice. You don't have to tell anybody you watched it. Just let it be a guilty pleasure. Oh and just a side note, why can't we get this film out on dvd? There is far far worse out there available.
