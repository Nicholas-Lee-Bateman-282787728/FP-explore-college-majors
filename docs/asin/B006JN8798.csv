Stone Cold is out for vengeance over his slain family, or friends, or all the BBQ meat that was wasted when they were shot- I'm not really sure. Stone Cold is way too manly and gruff to ever clearly articulate his true intentions. During Recoil's 90-some minutes, Stone Cold brings two things - the beat down and the body count. Exposition is an unnecessary consideration.Reviewing Recoil on its own terms, I have to say it's a good film. The action doesn't really stop and certainly doesn't give way to the story. Danny Trejo also gives a suitably snarly performance as the leader of the biker gang and head bad guy. Like any worthy antagonist, he succeeds admirably in upping the level of carnage within film.While low budget, the film is competently shot and the fight scenes are fairly well choreographed.  There are some scenes of mild torture, which may add a star to the tally above, depending on your point of view.Stone Cold's performance is worthy of special mention. As opposed to just merely beating guys with his fists and strangling them, he employs a wider variety of weapons when dispatching his foes in this film. It's nice to see Stone Cold leave his comfort zone in an attempt to further develop his acting craft. He sets one dude on fire, which was cool to me because I've always wanted to do this.I've given Recoil a three star rating because it was enjoyable. Sure it's not quite on the same level as other Stone Cold classics like Condemned or Damage, but it brings enough to the table in terms of sheer carnage for me to recommend.",3,Stone Cold Shenanigans,1365292800,"04 7, 2013",2013,1635,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'Stone', 'Cold', 'films', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'Recoil', 'Stone', 'Cold', 'out', 'vengeance', 'slain', 'family', 'friends', 'BBQ', 'meat', 'was', 'wasted', 'when', 'were', 'shot-', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'Stone', 'Cold', 'way', 'too', 'manly', 'gruff', 'ever', 'clearly', 'articulate', 'true', 'intentions', 'Recoil', '90-some', 'minutes', 'Stone', 'Cold', 'two', 'things', 'beat', 'down', 'body', 'count', 'Exposition', 'unnecessary', 'consideration.Reviewing', 'Recoil', 'own', 'terms', 'have', 'say', 'good', 'film', 'action', ""n't"", 'really', 'stop', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'give', 'way', 'story', 'Danny', 'Trejo', 'also', 'suitably', 'snarly', 'performance', 'leader', 'biker', 'gang', 'head', 'bad', 'guy', 'worthy', 'antagonist', 'admirably', 'upping', 'level', 'carnage', 'film.While', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'competently', 'shot', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'fairly', 'well', 'choreographed', 'are', 'scenes', 'mild', 'torture', 'may', 'add', 'star', 'tally', 'depending', 'point', 'view.Stone', 'Cold', 'performance', 'worthy', 'special', 'mention', 'opposed', 'just', 'merely', 'beating', 'guys', 'fists', 'strangling', 'wider', 'variety', 'weapons', 'when', 'dispatching', 'foes', 'film', 'nice', 'see', 'Stone', 'Cold', 'leave', 'comfort', 'zone', 'attempt', 'further', 'develop', 'acting', 'craft', 'one', 'dude', 'fire', 'was', 'cool', ""'ve"", 'always', 'wanted', 'do', 'this.I', ""'ve"", 'given', 'Recoil', 'three', 'star', 'rating', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'Sure', 'not', 'quite', 'same', 'level', 'other', 'Stone', 'Cold', 'classics', 'Condemned', 'Damage', 'enough', 'table', 'terms', 'sheer', 'carnage', 'recommend']",Recoil

But it seems since then Austin's movie appearances and starring roles have really gone down hill. I haven't seen a decent film starring him since the previous two movies I mentioned. This one has been by far one of the worst. It's not so much the acting or the budget, it does appear to be a well filmed movie and the acting on most people other then Austin's part was not too bad. I won't go to extremes and say Austin can't act. He's meant to be an action star now, and quite frankly a lot of the action stars make movies not based on great acting skills, but they usually make a decent action flick.. hence Van Damn and Dolph Lungren... but what did not sit well with me during this movie is Austin just seemed too tough to beleive.The plot is about Ryan Something played by Austin who rolls into a town called Hope to seek out vengeance. Austins character is an ex-cop who is hunting down the men who killed his family. He takes one out and all of a sudden the towns biker gang who run the whole town of Hope want Austin dead. The gang is lead by whoever it is Danny Trejo plays. He is the ring leader and owns the town, with drugs and gun shipping and has the cops on the pay roll blah blah blah... heard it before? I have too, which is why I don't have much to say in a positive light regarding that area.Austin plays a character that comes into town, and seems bulletproof, he rattles the lions cage, and announces he is the toughest SOB on the planet, which OK, if this was the WWE, we'd buy into something like that and accept it as entertainment, but in a movie like this, we are really supposed to beleive the guy is so well trained and can fight so perfectly that no one can stop him? He can disarm a guys gun with a single look, can hold a mans throat over the edge of a cliff with one hands grip, can leap tall buildings in a single bound and blah blah blah blah ... OK WE GET IT, he's a hard arse... but when you watch this film, it's like someone ticked off Superman, so Superman slowly saves the day where no one had a chance of stopping him anyway.There is also a few little side stories that either needed to be utilized to make sense of why they are in this movie, or cut them out all together. I am specifically directing that comment to the role Lochlyn Munro plays, as one of the most useless inserts I have seen in an attempt to stretch a movie out more then it needs to be. It's not Lochlyn's fault tho, just bad decisions on how the plot and reason of his character was brought in in the first place.If you are a die-hard fan of Austin, then there will be no stopping you seeing this movie, but for the average action fan, it's passable as a barely OK movie, but keep in mind the reason most people will be interested is it's Austin vs Trejo really... but in the end, I was disappointed with the result that this was the best someone could come up with. Because of Austin and Trejo, the film will be overrated and I expect other reviews will say ""The movies no good, but it's great to see Austin and Trejo in a film together"" which is not going to get a thumbs up from me just because they are in it. I won't give this movie even 3 stars just for being based on novelty... it's just not good enough for me to ever want to see again, or recommend it to anyone else.",2,"OH HELL NO.. and thats the bottom line, because I said so.",1334448000,"04 15, 2012",2012,3511,"[""'Ole"", 'Stone', 'Cold', 'looked', 'promising', 'when', 'switching', 'pro-wrestling', 'scene', 'big', 'screen', 'earlier', 'movies', 'such', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'remake', 'Longest', 'Yard', 'personal', 'favorite', 'date', 'Condemned', 'then', 'Austin', 'movie', 'appearances', 'starring', 'roles', 'have', 'really', 'gone', 'down', 'hill', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'decent', 'film', 'starring', 'previous', 'two', 'movies', 'mentioned', 'one', 'been', 'far', 'one', 'worst', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'acting', 'budget', 'appear', 'be', 'well', 'filmed', 'movie', 'acting', 'most', 'people', 'other', 'then', 'Austin', 'part', 'was', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'extremes', 'say', 'Austin', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'meant', 'be', 'action', 'star', 'now', 'quite', 'frankly', 'lot', 'action', 'stars', 'make', 'movies', 'not', 'based', 'great', 'acting', 'skills', 'usually', 'make', 'decent', 'action', 'flick..', 'hence', 'Van', 'Damn', 'Dolph', 'Lungren', 'what', 'did', 'not', 'sit', 'well', 'movie', 'Austin', 'just', 'seemed', 'too', 'tough', 'beleive.The', 'plot', 'Ryan', 'Something', 'played', 'Austin', 'who', 'town', 'called', 'Hope', 'seek', 'out', 'vengeance', 'Austins', 'character', 'ex-cop', 'who', 'hunting', 'down', 'men', 'who', 'killed', 'family', 'one', 'out', 'sudden', 'towns', 'biker', 'gang', 'who', 'run', 'whole', 'town', 'Hope', 'want', 'Austin', 'dead', 'gang', 'lead', 'whoever', 'Danny', 'Trejo', 'ring', 'leader', 'town', 'drugs', 'gun', 'shipping', 'cops', 'pay', 'roll', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'heard', 'have', 'too', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'say', 'positive', 'light', 'regarding', 'area.Austin', 'character', 'town', 'bulletproof', 'lions', 'cage', 'announces', 'toughest', 'SOB', 'planet', 'OK', 'was', 'WWE', ""'d"", 'buy', 'something', 'accept', 'entertainment', 'movie', 'are', 'really', 'supposed', 'beleive', 'guy', 'so', 'well', 'trained', 'can', 'fight', 'so', 'perfectly', 'one', 'can', 'stop', 'can', 'disarm', 'guys', 'gun', 'single', 'look', 'can', 'hold', 'mans', 'throat', 'edge', 'cliff', 'one', 'hands', 'grip', 'can', 'leap', 'tall', 'buildings', 'single', 'bound', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'WE', 'GET', 'IT', 'hard', 'arse', 'when', 'watch', 'film', 'someone', 'ticked', 'off', 'Superman', 'so', 'Superman', 'slowly', 'day', 'where', 'one', 'had', 'chance', 'stopping', 'anyway.There', 'also', 'few', 'little', 'side', 'stories', 'needed', 'be', 'utilized', 'make', 'sense', 'why', 'are', 'movie', 'cut', 'out', 'together', 'am', 'specifically', 'directing', 'comment', 'role', 'Lochlyn', 'Munro', 'one', 'most', 'useless', 'inserts', 'have', 'seen', 'attempt', 'stretch', 'movie', 'more', 'then', 'be', 'not', 'Lochlyn', 'fault', 'tho', 'just', 'bad', 'decisions', 'how', 'plot', 'reason', 'character', 'was', 'brought', 'first', 'place.If', 'are', 'die-hard', 'fan', 'Austin', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'no', 'stopping', 'seeing', 'movie', 'average', 'action', 'fan', 'passable', 'barely', 'OK', 'movie', 'keep', 'mind', 'reason', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'interested', 'Austin', 'vs', 'Trejo', 'really', 'end', 'was', 'disappointed', 'result', 'was', 'best', 'someone', 'could', 'come', 'up', 'Austin', 'Trejo', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'overrated', 'expect', 'other', 'reviews', 'will', 'say', 'movies', 'good', 'great', 'see', 'Austin', 'Trejo', 'film', 'together', 'not', 'going', 'get', 'thumbs', 'up', 'just', 'are', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'movie', 'even', '3', 'stars', 'just', 'being', 'based', 'novelty', 'just', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'ever', 'want', 'see', 'again', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'else']",Recoil

Ryan Varrett (Steve Austin) ""sneaks"" around in a Dodge GTX muscle machine, cruising Washington State (Seagal's territory). He plays a vigilante ex-cop who goes after the bad guys who killed his family and any other bad guys who know them. (Don't try this at home.) The film mixes dry humor with stone cold action. The first kill is a man hunting rabbits with an automatic weapon. He misses a bunny at about 10 yards. Austin crushes his neck and tosses him off a cliff. The cops describe the body as ""abstract art."" Austin has flashbacks to the killing (happens before movie starts) and the police are searching for the bunny killer. These provide a very minor subplot.A waitress remarks, ""Canada, not much up that way but Canada."" I am laughing at the dialouge and I haven't figured out if the comedy is intentional. Austin ends up in Hope, Washington. ""Hope"" is a common name for symbolism or irony...normally from writers who couldn't come up with something better, or if they did, wouldn't think their audience could grasp it. Serinda Swan plays Darcy the local motel owner. She is a widow who smokes, drinks JD, and knows muscle machines.Austin makes friends with the local bike club known as ""The Circle"" when he beats up a member who threatened to shoot a puppy (I love this stuff). Danny Trejo, in one of his ""rare"" bad guy appearances, plays the Drayke, the gang leader. Noel Gugliemi as Rex did a great job as a gang member. The gang has hobbies such as cage matches with electrified fences, drug manufacturing, and town terrorizing. It is the typical movie gang, one that runs guns but fights with tools. Stone Cold has other hobbies.I enjoyed this action film. It had the right amount of action, humor (intentional and unintentional), and plot filler. It doesn't bother to give us any character build up as they all fit stereotypes. No plot twists, and if you seen enough of these, you can write the ending before the opening credits. As a fan of Austin, Trejo, vigilante films, and grindhouse it is worth a view. In the realistic scheme of things, this is not a five star movie, but I enjoyed it as much as one.F-bomb, woman violence, CG explosions, Obama picture in police station, no sex, no nudity (Hey!

After the murder of his wife and child former cop Ryan Varrett (Austin) becomes obsessed with revenge and justice. When he gets to the town of Hope he finds what he is looking for. I have always wondered why wrestlers (who pretty much act for a living) have never been good movie actors. I liked Stone Cold when he was wrestling but as an actor he is quite bad. This is a hard movie to review for me. The opening five minutes were so bad I was laughing and wanted to turn it off, but the longer it went on the more I liked it. I'm not sure if it was because it was actually a good movie or if I just got used to it. I think I mainly liked it because of the idea. I loved ""Boondock Saints"" and while it's impossible to compare the two, any movie about a vigilante who doses out his own justice to those who fall through the cracks is OK with me.
