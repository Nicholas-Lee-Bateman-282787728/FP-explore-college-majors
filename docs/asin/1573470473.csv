He killed his maker and has vowed to destroy his entire Vampire Blood line.In the beginning Zachary is hunting a Master Vampire, Ash, who was made by Radu. He finds that Ash is obsessed with a young piano player named Sofia.  Prior to that Zachary had only been a hunter, but when Sofia enter his life he found himself protective of her.Zachary fails to prevent to Sophia from being captured by Ash.  Taking her to his lair Ash slowly works to break her spirit and make her his alone.  Zachary manages to free Sofia, but not save her from being turned.

Zachary has taken it  upon himself to travel the world in search of all vampires to rid the world  of their evil presence.  When searching for his latest victim Ash, he meets  up with a musician Sofia and begins to care for her.  Ash also cares for  Sofia and the conflict begins.Jonathon Morris as Ash is a pretty good  bad vampire and the slight tie in's with the Subspecies series are clever  and fun to watch.David Gunn (Zachary) and Kirsten Cerre (Sofia) both  play good roles as well, but were not charismatic enough for me to really  care about them as much as Michelle of the Subspecies series.Floriella  Grappini (Serena) is sexy in her small but important role and I was quite  happy to see her return in Subspecies IV: Bloodstorm.Overall as long  as Subspecies films can be produced I would prefer those, perhaps even  integrated with this series and the characters contained in it.

This is a WONDERFUL, AWFUL movie that takes every romantic vampire cliche in existence and squashes them into a big velvet-and-lace disaster.In fact, watching this movie is kind of like diving headfirst into the fanfiction of a 13-year-old Anne Rice fan, with lots of lace, velvet, classical music, marble pillars and flowing hair. It moves very slowly and there isn't actually a lot going on, but the serious, melodramatic tone of every scene makes it unintentionally hilarious (""I have no wish to violate your flesh!"").The story follows Zachary (David Gunn), a melancholy vampire with a conscience who seeks to destroy all vampires of his bloodline. Fortunately, he has the Sword of Laertes, which has the power to kill vampires... just like every other sword.Zachary's latest target is Ash (Jonathon Morris), a master vampire with a love of classical music -- and he's fixed his gaze on Sofia (Kirsten Cerre), a talented young pianist. Zachary manages to rescue Sofia from Ash at first, but it turns out Ash has invited her to perform at his personal abode, Club Muse (which is a sort of casino/brothel/vampire restaurant).Well, you can probably guess exactly what Ash has in store for Sofia -- he wants to immortalize her musical skills by turning her into a vampire. So he entraps her in his bedroom, slowly breaking her will so that she will accept him as her master. Zachary has only a short time to save her, but doing so might lure him back to the darkness.""Vampire Journals"" is one of those baroque/gothic/romantic slabs of vampire fantasy -- graveyards, wrought-iron, classical music, silk and satin and lace, old world aristocrats and vast shadowy mansions filled with marble. Supposedly this is a spinoff of ""Subspecies,"" but it has a completely different atmosphere and storyline.And it's HILARIOUS. The entire thing is very ponderous and melodramatic, with lots of talk about the torture of being immortal and so on and so forth. The dialogue is often silly (""Take me out into the Great Night, Master! I crave the hunt!"") and there are long, slow-moving parts where we have people just sort of drifting around looking off into space and/or biting people. And it's handled SO seriously that it's difficult not to giggle.Also, there are breasts. It's actually hilarious, because they just sort of appear randomly. For instance, the movie opens with a woman in a gauzy dress dancing slowly in a dark, misty mansion... and then when a vampire chases her down, her boob pops out. Very unintentionally funny.Compared to ""Subspecies 4,"" Jonathon Morris is actually quite enjoyable here -- Ash is refined, manipulative, and always talks like he's in mid-swoon. Gunn does as well as anyone can with the ""vampire with a heart"" cliche; Cerre is required to do little more than cry, scream and twinkle at Gunn; and Ilinca Goia says every single line in a breathy pseudo-erotic whisper.""Vampire Journals"" is a bad movie, but in a hilarious MST3K way -- it's so melodramatic and full of vampire schlock that it ends up being fun by accident.

VAMPIRE JOURNALS is one of the better horror flicks generated by Charles Band's band of merrymen.Lushly filmed and lit, with an eerie and haunting musical score, the story plays out like an Anne Rice novel with a ""good"" vampire and of course a very ""bad"" one.  An unusual twist is that the vampires don't go out and search for their victims; they lure them to the Club Muse where they have orgies and brothels, etc.  The ""hunt"" is reserved for the head vampire, Ash, and his sometime companion, Cassandra.Ted Nicolau directs with a somber flair, and gives us beautifully lit segments that truly conjure images of the night and its loneliness.  Jonathon Morris as Ash is a suave, smooth speaking vampire, egocentric, powerful and merciless.  Kisten Cerre is the doomed Sophia, lovely in a plain way, and she gives a credible horror damsel performance.  David Gunn, too reminiscent of Adam Ant, does well in displaying the conflict of being a good mortal but still a vampire needing to feed.  Starr Andreef as the human Iris lends a sensuality and duplicity as Ash's human compatriate.

188913,A11S26M1MUM7O7,1573470473,Neil Ford,"[8, 10]","This straight-to-video movie (not based on the book of the same title) is a strange mixture of the quite good and the rather bad. Filmed in Romania, it takes advantage of the wonderful old mansions there, with their marble walls and floors and inlaid wood-work and gold leaf. (Perhaps also qualifying as ""scenery"" are the gratuitous naked women who appear occasionally, presumably only for commercial reasons.) It is shot in full-screen (4:3) and sound is 2.0.The story is archetypal for the modern vampire genre: a lone ""good"" vampire; a vampire enclave racked by resentment and power struggles; a bleak ending. The film makes few concessions to those unfamiliar with the tenets of the genre, which some may find jarring.Full Moon Productions continue their tradition of casting the best actors in the supporting roles: Starr Andreeff is convincing in the tricky role of a human who serves the vampires from avaricious motives, while Kirsten Cerre manages to sustain a note of high terror through the second half of the film, believably and without becoming repetitive or shrill. Kudos also to the actors who play the parts of Cassandra, Dimitri and Anton. It would be great to see these actors in bigger and better productions. The director gets good performances even from bit-parts: note the girl who offers herself to Zachary towards the end - in most B-grade movies she would have been a vacant silicon-enhanced bimbo, but here, before she even speaks, she radiates great sadness and hopelessness. Brilliant.The two main parts, however, are miscast: the ""hero"" makes a commendable effort, but is too callow for the role (I kept expecting him to finish his lines with the word ""dude"") and lumbered with some rather unconvincing makeup, while the ""villain"" is impressively malevolent, but with a rather humourless, one-note performance. Admittedly, this film is deliberately grim and humourless, but I think there was more potential for depth with this character.The photography and lighting are mostly successful, the lighting achieving remarkably beautiful effects, but occasionally the techniques descend to classic ""B-movie"" methods, with lurching hand-held shots and overuse of up-from-under angles, which cheapen the look of the film. The photographer has clearly come up with some great work-arounds for his budget limitations; if only these could have been applied more consistently.I should also mention the simple trick used to show the vampire travelling as a shadow, which is unconventional, but I think actually worked well and suggested the techniques of the classic German expressionist films of the 1920s. On the other hand, in the props department, the ""Blade of Laertes"" seems to have no more weight than a plastic toy! The script veers in a similar fashion between poetic and silly.This film really lets itself down in its opening and closing sequences: the opening sequence is confusing and looks rushed; the ending is abrupt and thus seems arbitrary. A little more time and attention here would have improved the effect of the whole film.In a previous version of this review, I criticised the musical score for being over-present and obviously synthesised. I've changed my mind about that: I think the score is creative and melodically interesting. The score does often seem a little 'busy', however, when minimalism would've been more effective.Overall, this film is a mixed bag, primarily due to its limited budget. If you make allowance for this, you'll find much of interest here (especially if you are a fan of the genre). Vampire Journals may not, ultimately, be successful as a movie, but I think it is a very interesting failure.",2,Good and bad aspects ...,1065139200,"10 3, 2003",2003,3662,"['straight-to-video', 'movie', 'not', 'based', 'book', 'same', 'title', 'strange', 'mixture', 'quite', 'good', 'rather', 'bad', 'Filmed', 'Romania', 'advantage', 'wonderful', 'old', 'mansions', 'there', 'marble', 'walls', 'floors', 'inlaid', 'wood-work', 'gold', 'leaf', 'Perhaps', 'also', 'qualifying', 'scenery', 'are', 'gratuitous', 'naked', 'women', 'who', 'appear', 'occasionally', 'presumably', 'only', 'commercial', 'reasons', 'shot', 'full-screen', '4:3', 'sound', '2.0.The', 'story', 'archetypal', 'modern', 'vampire', 'genre', 'lone', 'good', 'vampire', 'vampire', 'enclave', 'racked', 'resentment', 'power', 'struggles', 'bleak', 'ending', 'film', 'few', 'concessions', 'unfamiliar', 'tenets', 'genre', 'may', 'find', 'jarring.Full', 'Moon', 'Productions', 'continue', 'tradition', 'casting', 'best', 'actors', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Starr', 'Andreeff', 'convincing', 'tricky', 'role', 'human', 'who', 'vampires', 'avaricious', 'motives', 'Kirsten', 'Cerre', 'sustain', 'note', 'high', 'terror', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'believably', 'becoming', 'repetitive', 'shrill', 'Kudos', 'also', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'parts', 'Cassandra', 'Dimitri', 'Anton', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'see', 'actors', 'bigger', 'better', 'productions', 'director', 'good', 'performances', 'even', 'bit-parts', 'note', 'girl', 'who', 'Zachary', 'end', 'most', 'B-grade', 'movies', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'vacant', 'silicon-enhanced', 'bimbo', 'here', 'even', 'speaks', 'great', 'sadness', 'hopelessness', 'Brilliant.The', 'two', 'main', 'parts', 'however', 'are', 'miscast', 'hero', 'commendable', 'effort', 'too', 'callow', 'role', 'kept', 'expecting', 'finish', 'lines', 'word', 'dude', 'lumbered', 'rather', 'unconvincing', 'makeup', 'villain', 'impressively', 'malevolent', 'rather', 'humourless', 'one-note', 'performance', 'Admittedly', 'film', 'deliberately', 'grim', 'humourless', 'think', 'was', 'more', 'potential', 'depth', 'character.The', 'photography', 'lighting', 'are', 'mostly', 'successful', 'lighting', 'achieving', 'remarkably', 'beautiful', 'effects', 'occasionally', 'techniques', 'descend', 'classic', 'B-movie', 'methods', 'lurching', 'hand-held', 'shots', 'overuse', 'up-from-under', 'angles', 'cheapen', 'look', 'film', 'photographer', 'clearly', 'come', 'up', 'great', 'work-arounds', 'budget', 'limitations', 'only', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'applied', 'more', 'consistently.I', 'should', 'also', 'mention', 'simple', 'trick', 'used', 'show', 'vampire', 'travelling', 'shadow', 'unconventional', 'think', 'actually', 'worked', 'well', 'suggested', 'techniques', 'classic', 'German', 'expressionist', 'films', '1920s', 'other', 'hand', 'props', 'department', 'Blade', 'Laertes', 'have', 'more', 'weight', 'plastic', 'toy', 'script', 'veers', 'similar', 'fashion', 'poetic', 'silly.This', 'film', 'really', 'down', 'opening', 'closing', 'sequences', 'opening', 'sequence', 'confusing', 'rushed', 'ending', 'abrupt', 'thus', 'arbitrary', 'little', 'more', 'time', 'attention', 'here', 'would', 'have', 'improved', 'effect', 'whole', 'film.In', 'previous', 'version', 'review', 'criticised', 'musical', 'score', 'being', 'over-present', 'obviously', 'synthesised', ""'ve"", 'changed', 'mind', 'think', 'score', 'creative', 'melodically', 'interesting', 'score', 'often', 'seem', 'little', ""'busy"", 'however', 'when', 'minimalism', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'more', 'effective.Overall', 'film', 'mixed', 'bag', 'primarily', 'due', 'limited', 'budget', 'make', 'allowance', ""'ll"", 'find', 'much', 'interest', 'here', 'especially', 'are', 'fan', 'genre', 'Vampire', 'Journals', 'may', 'not', 'ultimately', 'be', 'successful', 'movie', 'think', 'very', 'interesting', 'failure']",N/A

The vampire teeth/fangs look horrid on most of the actors, and I was bored for the last 1/3 of the film.Essentially, the plot...if you can even call it that pertains to a vampire named Zachary, who wants revenge for unwillingly being turned into what he is. So Zachary (Whoever thought to name a supposedly wise and powerful vampire Zachary anyway?) sets out to destroy an ancient and extremely lame vampire cult headed by Ashe, a fledgling of the main antagonist (Radu)of all the Subspecies films.In addition to this, Zachary tries to rescue a female pianist named Sophia, who has been kidnapped by Ashe. Because she is a gifted musician...or something, Sophia is being forced by Ashe, a  fervid music lover, into becoming a vampire as well. Really there's not much else to go into, except that you should definitely not waste your time or your money on this film. So unless you're a die-hard Subspecies fan, or you basically just want to get drunk and have something to make fun of with your friends, try watching Subspecies 1-3 because they're the best you're gonna get from director Ted Nicholau.",2,2 Whole Stars...I Must Be In A Generous Mood,1142208000,"03 13, 2006",2006,1656,"['title', ""'m"", 'being', 'mad', 'generous', 'giving', 'movie', 'two', 'stars', 'really', 'none', 'Subspecies', 'excellent', '4-part', 'series', 'written', 'directed', 'Full', 'Moon', 'Studio', 'Ted', 'Nicholau', 'Actually', 'first', 'three', 'Subspecies', 'are', 'allright', 'fourth', 'movie', 'sucks', 'opinion', 'However', 'Vampire', 'Journals', 'nothing', 'more', 'feeble', 'attempt', 'portray', 'different', 'side', 'Subspecies', 'archetype.The', 'characters', 'scenes', 'acting', 'Subspecies', 'Part', '1-3', 'were', 'superb', 'movie', 'insipid', 'plot', 'actors', 'are', 'novice', 'best', 'vampire', 'teeth/fangs', 'look', 'horrid', 'most', 'actors', 'was', 'bored', 'last', '1/3', 'film.Essentially', 'plot', 'can', 'even', 'call', 'vampire', 'named', 'Zachary', 'who', 'revenge', 'unwillingly', 'being', 'turned', 'what', 'So', 'Zachary', 'Whoever', 'thought', 'name', 'supposedly', 'wise', 'powerful', 'vampire', 'Zachary', 'anyway', 'out', 'destroy', 'ancient', 'extremely', 'lame', 'vampire', 'cult', 'headed', 'Ashe', 'fledgling', 'main', 'antagonist', 'Radu', 'Subspecies', 'addition', 'Zachary', 'tries', 'rescue', 'female', 'pianist', 'named', 'Sophia', 'who', 'been', 'kidnapped', 'Ashe', 'gifted', 'musician', 'something', 'Sophia', 'being', 'forced', 'Ashe', 'fervid', 'music', 'lover', 'becoming', 'vampire', 'as', 'well', 'Really', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'go', 'should', 'definitely', 'not', 'waste', 'time', 'money', 'film', 'So', ""'re"", 'die-hard', 'Subspecies', 'fan', 'basically', 'just', 'want', 'get', 'drunk', 'have', 'something', 'make', 'fun', 'friends', 'try', 'watching', 'Subspecies', '1-3', ""'re"", 'best', ""'re"", 'gon', 'get', 'director', 'Ted', 'Nicholau']",N/A

They all tied in together and the decision to shoot at them added to the gothic mystique.My biggest complaint with the movie is that there was too much 1st person narrative.As to the others complaint that there was no plot, that is not true. It is written as a character-driven plot. The audience is taken into the world of a master-vampire (the antagonist) and his servants. I wish that there was no first person narrative. In fact that main character seems almost minor to how much screen time the antagonist is given. As far as the script writing is concerned, the plot seems sidetracked. If we believe the narrative, the main plot is rescuing the damsel in distress. However, the movie instead focuses more around the lives of this secret group of vampires. The ""transformation"" of a vampire and his duty to his master is the subplot. The whole script could have been strengthened if the writer dug a little deeper and showed more of the story instead of expositioning it with monologues.As for the look--it reminded me of ""Interview with a Vampire"".

I found this disappointing.Zachary, a vampire 'with a soul' ala Angel, is hunting vampires throughout the streets of some distant goth European city. Sound good? Well, okay... If you're like me, you like this sort of thing.Only, the actor who played Zachary, looked like he was in pain throughout most of the movie. The teeth, deformed the shape of his mouth, and he had a weak chin, which just made him look pathetic rather than dashingly handsome. The white makeup and cavernous eye-sockets probably also did not help.Well, okay now, back to the plot. Our Hero, Zachary is hunting arch-vampire Ash, a vampire elder, who runs a club for vampires. (Gee where have I heard this one before).Soon, Zach and Ash are butting heads over a beautiful mortal female.What follows is a typical plot wherein, Zach must outwit Ash and rescue the human female.

I also noticed the bad vampire got to sleep with two topless chicks. They didn't have sex, it was I bite you, you bite me, fake an orgasm then roll over and go to sleep.
