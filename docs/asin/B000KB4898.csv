We have this girl who is living in deplorable conditions, but uses her imagination to get through each day.  It is not full of special effects and exteme fantasy like Pan's Labrynth though.The characters are just plain wierd, and everyone in this story seems mentally ill.  There is no real plot to the movie at all and it's just about this strange girl trying to find her place in the world.  No real conclusion at the end, so who knows what happens to her.  The characters are just weird for the sake of being wierd and nothing else.

1032844,A391UB1ZGDIPII,B000KB4898,aikanae,"[3, 3]","If your looking for a fantasy escape by way of a Disneyland-Hollywoodistic flair, then keep on looking. There's plenty of other films. This is a story about an abused kid and it should be uncomfortable. The film wasn't artificially disturbing or drawn out, and handled the biographical elements with an amazing sensitivity without discounting what was happening either. Yet the film is not depressing or sad. Cullin and Gilliam skillfully blended in lightness and joy for a view of another kind of magical childhood in an amazing, rare film.The story is about a little girl's fantasy world, but it's not about her world being a fantasy either. There's blurring between what could be seen as brilliant creativity or a form of protective madness; emotional fantasy or twisted reality; resilience or pending breakdown. The story unfolds in a natural, chronological way where later scenes explain the opening. She's rational when her mother dies, which seems natural at the time, but later, when she needs her father, she seems irrational. Her world is upside down and inside out in every way possible. What's usually considered the worst thing that could happen to a child, becomes her surreal life's dream come true instead.This movie is not meant for everyone. As I said, people idealizing all children have happy lives will hate this film. But for people amazed by children's innate abilities to cope with adversity will relate to the necessity of using fantasy for survival. For others though, this movie might be more disturbing as a reminder when they needed to use an imaginary world that was bigger than the actual events happening at the time. That's another reason why this film won't be for everyone.",5,Another kind of magical childhood,1219536000,"08 24, 2008",2008,1708,"['looking', 'fantasy', 'escape', 'way', 'Disneyland-Hollywoodistic', 'flair', 'then', 'keep', 'looking', 'plenty', 'other', 'films', 'story', 'abused', 'kid', 'should', 'be', 'uncomfortable', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'artificially', 'disturbing', 'drawn', 'out', 'handled', 'biographical', 'elements', 'amazing', 'sensitivity', 'discounting', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'either', 'film', 'not', 'depressing', 'sad', 'Cullin', 'Gilliam', 'skillfully', 'blended', 'lightness', 'joy', 'view', 'kind', 'magical', 'childhood', 'amazing', 'rare', 'film.The', 'story', 'little', 'girl', 'fantasy', 'world', 'not', 'world', 'being', 'fantasy', 'either', 'blurring', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'seen', 'brilliant', 'creativity', 'form', 'protective', 'madness', 'emotional', 'fantasy', 'twisted', 'reality', 'resilience', 'pending', 'breakdown', 'story', 'unfolds', 'natural', 'chronological', 'way', 'where', 'later', 'explain', 'opening', 'rational', 'when', 'mother', 'dies', 'natural', 'time', 'later', 'when', 'father', 'irrational', 'world', 'upside', 'down', 'inside', 'out', 'way', 'possible', 'What', 'usually', 'considered', 'worst', 'thing', 'could', 'happen', 'child', 'surreal', 'life', 'dream', 'come', 'true', 'instead.This', 'movie', 'not', 'meant', 'everyone', 'said', 'people', 'idealizing', 'children', 'have', 'happy', 'lives', 'will', 'hate', 'film', 'people', 'amazed', 'children', 'innate', 'abilities', 'cope', 'adversity', 'will', 'relate', 'necessity', 'using', 'fantasy', 'survival', 'others', 'though', 'movie', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'disturbing', 'reminder', 'when', 'needed', 'use', 'imaginary', 'world', 'was', 'bigger', 'actual', 'events', 'happening', 'time', 'reason', 'why', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'everyone']",Tideland

1032847,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000KB4898,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[15, 16]","Terry Gilliam is best known for his acting, directing, and writing within the Monty Python troupe. Mention his name in comedic circles and instantly you'll hear titles like THE LIFE OF BRIAN and MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL or maybe even the cultish BRAZIL.But more likely than not you've never heard of TIDELAND, which is unfortunate because it's a very good film. Not Mr. Gilliam's best directorial achievement, but certainly highly entertaining and grossly underrated. Receiving only a limited release in 2005, Tideland was quickly whisked out of theaters in favor of bigger blockbusters that held minimal substance by comparison.What else is interesting is the perfect casting and surprising comeuppance of eleven-year-old Jodelle Ferland who appears in nearly every frame of the film. Side by side with such veterans as Jeff Bridges (THE BIG LEBOWSKI) and Jennifer Tilly (MONSTERS, INC.), Ferland's performance was hilarious, sad, and openly weird.The story itself would've been intriguing enough, even without the great actors, in that it exposes the psyche of a young girl named Jeliza-Rose (Ferland) who must deal with the unpredictable, drug-addled behavior of her short-lived parents Queen (Tilly) and Noah (Bridges). She handles it by seeking solace in her imagination. When her mother dies, her father takes her on ""an adventure"" (think Alice In Wonderland) that carries her back to her father's vacant home in the middle of nowheresville. When her father decides to take a heroin ""vacation"", Jeliza-Rose is left on her own, playing with her bodiless dolls, finding a rabbit hole, and eventually stumbling upon a brain-damaged friend named Dickens (the PERFECTLY cast Brendan Fletcher, RV).Finding a friend, no matter how psychologically damaged he may be, Jeliza-Rose and Dickens form an intricate if fatalistic bond. Dickens believes the trains that run near his home to be a type of ""shark"" that patrol the ocean-like fields of wheat that span the nearby plains. His attempts to destroy this shark are poignantly funny in that he leaves coins on the railroad tracks in an attempt to ""sicken"" or derail the creature. Jeliza-Rose, joining his fantasy into her own world, creates a barrier in her own mind to distance herself from death, and it is so dark and so funny that viewers will find it amazing that they're laughing at her circumstances.Pushing boundaries is what good and great cinema is all about, and it certainly is what this film does. Tickling that dark funny bone while tugging heartstrings is probably one of the toughest things directors and actors can do, but Gilliam and his crew pulled it off without a hitch. The dark tonality of the production mixed extremely well with the comedic events that Jeliza-Rose inserts in order to protect herself.If you're a dark comedy fan, this one is a must.",4,Gilliam's Dark Comedy Homerun,1174780800,"03 25, 2007",2007,2828,"['Terry', 'Gilliam', 'best', 'known', 'acting', 'directing', 'writing', 'Monty', 'Python', 'troupe', 'Mention', 'name', 'comedic', 'circles', 'instantly', ""'ll"", 'hear', 'titles', 'THE', 'LIFE', 'OF', 'BRIAN', 'MONTY', 'PYTHON', 'AND', 'THE', 'HOLY', 'GRAIL', 'maybe', 'even', 'cultish', 'BRAZIL.But', 'more', 'likely', 'not', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'TIDELAND', 'unfortunate', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'Not', 'Mr.', 'Gilliam', 'best', 'directorial', 'achievement', 'certainly', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'grossly', 'underrated', 'Receiving', 'only', 'limited', 'release', '2005', 'Tideland', 'was', 'quickly', 'whisked', 'theaters', 'favor', 'bigger', 'blockbusters', 'held', 'minimal', 'substance', 'comparison.What', 'else', 'interesting', 'perfect', 'casting', 'surprising', 'comeuppance', 'eleven-year-old', 'Jodelle', 'Ferland', 'who', 'nearly', 'frame', 'film', 'Side', 'side', 'such', 'veterans', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'THE', 'BIG', 'LEBOWSKI', 'Jennifer', 'Tilly', 'MONSTERS', 'INC.', 'Ferland', 'performance', 'was', 'hilarious', 'sad', 'openly', 'weird.The', 'story', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'intriguing', 'enough', 'even', 'great', 'actors', 'psyche', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Jeliza-Rose', 'Ferland', 'who', 'must', 'deal', 'unpredictable', 'drug-addled', 'behavior', 'short-lived', 'parents', 'Queen', 'Tilly', 'Noah', 'Bridges', 'seeking', 'solace', 'imagination', 'When', 'mother', 'dies', 'father', 'adventure', 'think', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', 'back', 'father', 'vacant', 'home', 'middle', 'nowheresville', 'When', 'father', 'take', 'heroin', 'vacation', 'Jeliza-Rose', 'left', 'own', 'playing', 'bodiless', 'dolls', 'finding', 'rabbit', 'hole', 'eventually', 'stumbling', 'brain-damaged', 'friend', 'named', 'Dickens', 'PERFECTLY', 'cast', 'Brendan', 'Fletcher', 'RV', '.Finding', 'friend', 'matter', 'how', 'psychologically', 'damaged', 'may', 'be', 'Jeliza-Rose', 'Dickens', 'form', 'intricate', 'fatalistic', 'bond', 'trains', 'run', 'home', 'be', 'type', 'shark', 'patrol', 'ocean-like', 'fields', 'wheat', 'nearby', 'plains', 'attempts', 'destroy', 'shark', 'are', 'poignantly', 'funny', 'coins', 'railroad', 'tracks', 'attempt', 'sicken', 'derail', 'creature', 'Jeliza-Rose', 'joining', 'fantasy', 'own', 'world', 'barrier', 'own', 'mind', 'distance', 'death', 'so', 'dark', 'so', 'funny', 'viewers', 'will', 'find', 'amazing', ""'re"", 'laughing', 'circumstances.Pushing', 'boundaries', 'what', 'good', 'great', 'cinema', 'certainly', 'what', 'film', 'Tickling', 'dark', 'funny', 'bone', 'tugging', 'heartstrings', 'probably', 'one', 'toughest', 'things', 'directors', 'actors', 'can', 'do', 'Gilliam', 'crew', 'pulled', 'off', 'hitch', 'dark', 'tonality', 'production', 'mixed', 'extremely', 'well', 'comedic', 'events', 'Jeliza-Rose', 'inserts', 'order', 'protect', 'herself.If', ""'re"", 'dark', 'comedy', 'fan', 'one', 'must']",Tideland

A lot of people are questioning why he would attach his name to something so terrible and disturbing and that he is slipping as a director.  This is not true.  The film is not all that disturbing, it has it's moments but nothing really terrible.  The story is strange and only Gilliam would have been able to tell it right. It's flaws lie in it's story, not the direction.  The story itself is very very slow and feels like it doesn't go anywhere.  People even argue that it has no story at all. Well, There is a story and a very deep and meaningful one if you can pull your eyes open a little bit and look deeper into it.  But it is slow and it doesn't really start or end.  The acting is brilliant and the direction is great. Gilliam could have done a little bit more with this film in terms of the story being a little slow, he could have amped up some more cool visual sequences but trust in Gilliam.  And for all those who have said this movie is an abomination, you can kiss off... and ask yourself this question...

I kept thinking that everyone was a figment of her imagination. At least that way the movie made sense.[SPOILERS TO FOLLOW]I don't get it: so Jeliza-Rose's heroin addicted father takes her to his mother's home, a mother who is dead but he was never notified of this?  Her house is empty with all her stuff still there?  She lives in a big field of hay next to a busy train?? Her neighbors keep dead people in their house? No one finds this odd?  I live in New York my whole life but I think that even the most country of bumpkins would find that SOMEONE like the mailman or a neighbor would have noticed the smell of rotting flesh? That smell doesn't bother ANYONE, not even a small girl?  I don't know, maybe I'm just nit-picking but I kept thinking that all of these things were just parts of Jeliza-Rose's mind.  Reading the plot on Wikipedia and all these reviews has alerted me that I'm quite wrong.  Maybe I should have read the book first.The only good part about this movie was the acting. It appeared to have a tremendously low budget so it could not turn out the spectacular visuals of movies like Pan's Labyrinth or The Fountain, which is a shame because I got tired of looking at rotting corpses, doll heads, and hay for two hours.  But the acting was excellent.  That girl - whoever played Jeliza-Rose - was a tremendously talented actress.  She dominated the film often by herself for a large amount of time, having to switch on and off between being herself and being those dolls.  Excellent actress.  Dickens and Dell were also great and Jennifer Tilly and Jeff Bridges were virtually unrecognizable as the drug-addicted dirtbag parents. Excellent acting on everyone's part.Unfortunately, the good acting didn't do enough to make up for the confusing plot (for me, at least). I found too many holes in the plot and I kept thinking that Jeliza-Rose was making everything up, sort of reverting to a fantasy world as a child's way of avoiding having to deal with the very adult notion of having become an orphan within like a week.  At the very end [again, SPOLER ALERT] when she thinks she sees Dickens by the train wreck but it turns out just to be some wounded and traumatized man, it reinforced for me that these people WERE figments of the imagination. I even thought maybe she and her father hadn't made it to the grandmother's house and that they'd been on the train when it crashed. (I didn't get that Dickens had used his dynamite to derail the train).  Where did Dickens - a mentally retarded boy/man - get dynamite? What was the significance of Jeliza-Rose catching Dell doing SOME crazy sexual thing to some guy in the shed?  What was up with that squirrel?  Maybe these are questions for the author of the book and not the creator of the movie, I don't know.Just way too confusing and boring for me.

One of the biggest problems is the performance by Ferland, who is simply not up to carrying a major motion picture on her shoulders.  I was also put off by the brother-sister pair, but they run up against a prejudice of mine that may not be shared by other viewers--I am annoyed by characters who are outfitted with so many quirks that they seem less like real people than walking metaphors meant to embody the writer's thematic concerns.  I realize that everything in the film is filtered through the perceptions of this odd and precocious little girl, and if the film had been more compelling I might have been more patient with its problematic aspects.

It delves into the mind of a young girl who handles a troubled - yet surprisingly love filled - upbringing with a strange grace. Well into the film, I finally understood what Gilliam was doing (I hope). This is meant to show the story from the perspective of a young girl's imagination. We see everything through her eyes and experience on an almost visceral level her interpretation of the events of her tragic life.And as I mentioned, there's a surprising amount of love in the movie. Her drug addict loser dad (played by Jeff Bridges) showed her nothing but kindness and affection, despite his considerable defects of character and irresponsibility.The character of Jelize-Rose (Jodelle Ferland) was brilliantly performed and directed. Young Ms. Ferland's performance was as professional and compelling as any actress could hope to deliver.And you got a sense that no matter how weird events became, you knew that in the end all would be well.

1032859,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B000KB4898,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[3, 5]","Terry Gilliam has always made astoundingly weird movies, from his little Monty Python cartoons to the classic ""Brazil."" Nobody knows how to combine childlike wonder with creepy darkness.So it doesn't exactly startle that he's tackled Mitch Cullin's southern gothic novel, and turned it into an eerie sort of ""Brazil-Meets-Alice-In-Wonderland."" It lacks much of a cohesive plot, but Gilliam can still make a creepy, exquisite storyline that takes place half in the weirdness of this world, half in a little girl's head.When her crazed mother ODs and dies, Jeliza-Rose (Jodelle Ferland) and her washed-up dad Noah (Jeff Bridges) move to a decrepit Texas farm. But like most junkies, Noah soon dies as well. Jeliza-Rose seems to go into denial, letting her father's body sit in the house as she explores the rippling grass -- like a sea -- around her house, spinning a series of dreamlike fantasies.She's accompanied by four doll's heads and a variety of fantastical visions, all to help her cope with her loneliness. But then she befriends the child-man Dickens (Brendan Fletcher) and his eccentric sister Dell (Janet McTeer). A darker side starts to creep into Jeliza-Rose's world, as Dickens' vendetta against the Monster Shark leads to disaster.Terry Gilliam has basically made a career out of being weird, and all the movies he's made reflect that. Sometimes his movies are absolutely brilliant (""Brazil""), and sometimes it's just average (""Brothers Grimm""). It's too soon to judge how ""Tideland"" will be remembered, but I'm thinking that it will be remembered as one of Gilliam's most moving films.The plot is pretty simple -- incomprehensible to those expecting a ""normal"" story -- but it sort of drifts off after Noah's demise. It would have been nice to have a bit more complexity there.  But Gilliam does keep it afloat by relying mostly on Jeliza-Rose's imagination to keep the story going, sort of like Alice in Wonderland did.Gilliam has always been great at surreal stuff, and he has all sorts here -- talking squirrels, the talking doll-heads, a house sinking into the earth, and a guy who prowls around the prairie in SCUBA gear. Even the landscape -- golden seas of grass, gnarled trees -- has a weird, unearthly look.But for all this whimsy, Gilliam keeps his eye on the dark side of things -- Jeliza-Rose is trying to escape the horrors of her reality, through a sort of controlled madness. Even when she returns to reality, she won't be able to escape the death and sorrow -- so maybe a little madness is necessary to keep sane.Jodelle Ferland deserves a special shout-out, especially since she's the center of the entire movie. Her Jeliza-Rose is a wonderful kid -- precocious, intelligent, creative and surprisingly innocent considering that we see her prepping heroin for her dad. But she's still a child, with all of a child's vulnerabilities and fears, and Ferland makes us feel that as well.""Tideland"" is not a fun movie -- it's disturbing, macabre, and very funny, with some charmingly whimsical visuals.

Unpleasant? Very much so. Original?  The director himself called his movie, ""Alice in Wonderland meets Psycho"" and these are just two references of many.

Gilliam in ""Tideland"" borrows from them or rather meditates on the same themes, using his unique tools, and bringing his unique vision and talent in the familiar harrowing story of a child lost.The movie is technically superb and visually arresting - it must be. If anything, Terry Gilliam is known as one of the most talented and wildly imaginative modern filmmakers, the true eccentric. He describes himself better than anyone ever would:""There's a side of me that always fell for manic things, frenzied, cartoony performances. I always liked sideshows, freakshows. ...Absolutely grotesque, awful, tasteless. I like things to be tasteless.""I guess, whether you'd like ""Tideland"" or not, would depend a lot on your sharing his fondness for the things ""absolutely grotesque, awful, tasteless"" - there are plenty of them in ""Tideland"" yet strangely it is tender and sad, and in its best moments undeniably brilliant. Often called modern fairy tale for adults, the movie fits perfectly the description. Fairy tales, the unabridged versions of them are often scary, graphic, disturbing, violent, bloody, gory...and fascinating.  Brothers Grimm, Hans Christian Anderson - his ""Little Mermaid"" is one of the saddest, even tragic tales ever written"". Oscar Wilde's fairy tales, ""Arabian Nights"" - the real thing, not the adaptations for the children; myths and legends of ancient Greece - the myth of two brothers, Atreus and Thyestes, the story of Oedipus - that's pure horror and tragedy. Well, back to the Gilliam's fairy tale. Did I like it? I don't know. What I do know that the very last shot of the movie, the one which supposed to symbolize the happy ending, that of the girl's face from the angle that distorts her features turning the angelic face into the sinister cynical mask that could belong to the creature of the darkest nightmares and with two huge black holes of eyes is the most horrifying one in the movie which is packed with the scenes of horror.

1032861,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B000KB4898,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[3, 3]","Terry Gilliam is generally known for expansive, artificially constructed films such as BRAZIL.  With TIDELAND he takes a much more narrow focus.  Based on the 2000 novel by Mitch Cullin, the film concerns Jeliza-Rose (Jodelle Ferland), a child, who finds herself in an impossible situation.  Her mother (Jennifer Tilly) has died; her father (Jeff Bridges) has panicked and taken her to an abandoned house in rural Texas, where he too dies; and Jeliza-Rose is left to fend for herself.The result is not easily described.  Jeliza-Rose becomes interested in a neurotic neighbor (Janet McTeer) and her imbecile brother (Brendan Fletcher), and her association with them gives rise to home-made embalming and questionable affection for both her father's corpse and the imbecile brother.  Jeliza-Rose responds with a semi-psychotic state in which she talks to her dolls' heads, which she wears on her fingers; falls down a rabbit hole, just as Alice did; and ultimately stumbles into a tragedy that may in fact lead her back to normalicy.  Although a goodly number of these events are distasteful, TIDELANDS depicts them in cinematic beauty, and the effect is one of tremendous schism between the actual events and the way in which they are portrayed.The cast is extremely, extremely good.  Jodelle Ferland gives an astonshing performance; so too does the supporting cast, with Jeff Bridges a notable case in point.  Director Terry Gilliam endows the entire project with a bizarre vision, dragging us--often unwillingly--into Jeliza-Rose's strange, often surrealistic world with a tremendous sense of alien beauty.  It is strange, unsettling, peculiar, odd, graceful, delicate, ugly, and off hand I would say it is his best work since BRAZIL.  The double DVD includes a host of bonuses, including an audio commentary, a making-of documentary, and deleted scenes.  Recommended, but you have to go into this one with an open mind.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",4,"Beautiful, Disturbing, Difficult",1373587200,"07 12, 2013",2013,1941,"['Terry', 'Gilliam', 'generally', 'known', 'expansive', 'artificially', 'constructed', 'films', 'such', 'BRAZIL', 'TIDELAND', 'much', 'more', 'narrow', 'focus', 'Based', '2000', 'novel', 'Mitch', 'Cullin', 'film', 'concerns', 'Jeliza-Rose', 'Jodelle', 'Ferland', 'child', 'who', 'impossible', 'situation', 'mother', 'Jennifer', 'Tilly', 'died', 'father', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'panicked', 'taken', 'abandoned', 'house', 'rural', 'Texas', 'where', 'too', 'Jeliza-Rose', 'left', 'fend', 'herself.The', 'result', 'not', 'easily', 'described', 'Jeliza-Rose', 'becomes', 'interested', 'neurotic', 'neighbor', 'Janet', 'McTeer', 'imbecile', 'brother', 'Brendan', 'Fletcher', 'association', 'rise', 'home-made', 'embalming', 'questionable', 'affection', 'father', 'corpse', 'imbecile', 'brother', 'Jeliza-Rose', 'responds', 'semi-psychotic', 'state', 'dolls', 'heads', 'fingers', 'down', 'rabbit', 'hole', 'just', 'Alice', 'did', 'ultimately', 'tragedy', 'may', 'fact', 'back', 'normalicy', 'goodly', 'number', 'events', 'are', 'distasteful', 'TIDELANDS', 'cinematic', 'beauty', 'effect', 'one', 'tremendous', 'schism', 'actual', 'events', 'way', 'are', 'portrayed.The', 'cast', 'extremely', 'extremely', 'good', 'Jodelle', 'Ferland', 'astonshing', 'performance', 'so', 'too', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'notable', 'case', 'point', 'Director', 'Terry', 'Gilliam', 'entire', 'project', 'bizarre', 'vision', 'dragging', 'often', 'unwillingly', 'Jeliza-Rose', 'strange', 'often', 'surrealistic', 'world', 'tremendous', 'sense', 'alien', 'beauty', 'strange', 'unsettling', 'peculiar', 'odd', 'graceful', 'delicate', 'ugly', 'hand', 'would', 'say', 'best', 'work', 'BRAZIL', 'double', 'DVD', 'host', 'bonuses', 'including', 'audio', 'commentary', 'making-of', 'documentary', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Recommended', 'have', 'go', 'one', 'open', 'mind.GFT', 'Amazon', 'Reviewer']",Tideland

1032868,AQ38OU6SRFGU5,B000KB4898,"Jeffery E. Blascyk ""the Shamrock kid""","[8, 9]","Tideland is the 10th film by Director Terry Gilliam ( Brazil, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, 12 Monkeys).  Gilliam adapted this film from the Novel of the same title, written by Mitch Cullin. The Movie is prefaced with a short monologue by Gilliam telling the viewer that most people will not like this film and many will hate it.  It&#8217;s a specialty film that was not made for the masses.  He also said this entire movie is skewed from reality and is told through the eyes and perspective of a child. At the end of the day Gilliam does care if you enjoyed the film, as long as after you see it it makes you think.  With that said the film is nor confusing or as shocking as one might think at first viewing.  Tideland does not adhere to a formula or follow an adult&#8217;s logical conclusion.  Not many movies these days can you watch and really have no idea what direction it&#8217;s going to go in.Now it&#8217;s not just a movie with random scenes that don&#8217;t really fit into the bigger narrative structure of the story or of a conventional told story, it certainly has all those character elements transitions, and climax a movie needs to be entertaining.  This movie defiantly satisfies my hunger for rich and interesting characters.  Tideland is the smallest of Gilliam&#8217;s other projects, completely independent, free from any studio involvement, so the scale is much small and much more intimate which servers to the advantage of a story like this one.The main character is Jaliza-Rose, a nine year old child that has to tend to her junkie parents (Jennifer Tilly and Jeff Bridges) she helps ready her fathers Heroine injections and tends to he belligerent mothers whims and mood swings till one day her mother drops dead, Anna Nicole style.  Jeliza and her father then pack up and leave to an old farm house that her father, Noah (Played by Bridges, who is a washed up rock star) bought for his now dead mother. The house is old, run down and in the middle of nowhere surrounded by fields of wheat and grain. This is a direct contrast from Jeliza-Rose&#8217;s urban upbringing.Despite these never ending struggles and horrible situations she is forced to deal with, Jeliza-Rose is a very spirited and fun loving little girl.  She uses her imagination to escape these horrors of her reality.  She makes believe and escapes with help from her four imaginary friends that are old doll heads she wears on her fingers.  They all have different personalities that mirror her true feeling, one is pretty, and smart and confident, one is disfigured and ugly, one is very scared and one is just a stupid supermodel type, not really knowing what&#8217;s going on.  .This film is sweet, and yet disturbing. Gilliam touches on a lot of Taboos dealing with a young girl that have many people thinking he crossed the line.  This film is not gory and there is no real acts of violence in it but some of the images will shock you and many moments of suspense that really make you feel terror for this child.  Gilliam has tagged this movie &#8220;Alice in wonderland meets Psycho.&#8221; it&#8217;s a very fitting description.The movie is carried by the young actress playing the lead named Jodelle Ferland.  She is in almost every shot in the movie and has many speaking parts using different voices and accents.  She blows away anything that hack Dakota Fanning ever did.  Why, because she&#8217;s not playing a nine year old, she is being a nine year old.  So many young actresses are playing more grow up then a child would act in those situations.  Another notable performance is by Brendan Fletcher who played the mentally inept &#8220;Dickens&#8221; who befriends young Jelliza-Rose.  His performance is so moving I had to look to see if he was really mental deficient, he&#8217;s that good, (I am Sam and Forest Gump, eat your heart out). The movie is really about the resiliency of a child to cope with terrible things and how a child can endure and survive, sometimes much better than an adult.  It&#8217;s about a child using her imagination to try to understand things that no child should ever have to deal with.There are so many other elements like religious hypocrisy that are touched open very briefly without being over explained or thrown in your face.  It gets you thinking instead of telling you what to think like in such acclaimed Hollywood films like &#8220;Crash&#8221; that critics thought was so poignant and relevant but it nowhere in the film did it leave anything subjective or open ended, &#8220;this behavior is good and this behavior is bad,&#8221; Not in this filmGilliam is one of my favorite directors working today and is one of the most creative since the likes of Kubrick. Critics hated, I mean hated this movie.  I couldn&#8217;t believe when it came out late last year that it was received so poorly, it almost scared me away, thank good I learned a while ago that most critics are not worth the price of the word processing software they use to write their reviews.I can&#8217;t fault all of them for not liking this movie and I&#8217;m sure there will be at least one person who reads this review that goes and watches it and say&#8217;s &#8216;what a stupid movie&#8221; and you know, that&#8217;s ok.  It&#8217;s one of those personal films that I like knowing that not everyone will enjoy it this movie is a delight to watch and I have no problem popping it in a getting engrossed in the story and characters over and over again.  If you&#8217;re open minded to a unique film or you can say you&#8217;re a Gilliam fan you&#8217;ll walk away with something from this film.",5,Gilliam as a nine year old

1032871,A72A8JDQK4D8S,B000KB4898,John A. Lind,"[1, 1]","Blu-ray is a German release. Starts with automated Germany version of industry copyright warning, then launches into a foreword by Terry Gilliam with German dubbing over his voice. Use ""Audio"" button on remote control to switch to English audio. After foreword the film automatically starts and you can use remote to go to top menu. Select English soundtrack and turn off the German subtitles (the only subtitles available). Start playing again. Gilliam's short foreword basically warns that folks will either love or hate his film and advises them to see it as a child would. Blu-ray transfer is excellent in both picture quality and audio (including the 5.1 English).I agree with Gilliam's foreword that this film MUST be viewed keeping the mind of a child. Also helps immensely if one's childhood had a good amount of unstructured or minimally semi-structured play time which relied on imagination to create things to do. Sadly, too many contemporary childhoods are so structured 24/7 that kids' imaginations are being crippled. They grow up relying on someone . . . or a book of procedures/rules . . . telling them what to do, how to do it, and when to do it. This film requires being able to appreciate a 9-year old's imagination. It's the only thing she has, along with four doll heads, to entertain herself (until she meets Dell and Dickens). Too many try to read too much into the friendship the girl, Jeliza-Rose, develops with Dickens, a 20-year old retarded boy with a brain that was surgically split to reduce his epileptic seizures. His mental age is about the same as Jeliza-Rose (pre-pubescent). Their play in a couple of scenes is no more than what they've observed adults do, comprehending only a fraction of it. It **IS** what children do, even younger ones than these. Observing and mimicking adult behavior does not mean they fully comprehend it. This is evidenced when Jeliza-Rose accidentally observes Dell with a grocery delivery boy. it's very clear she does NOT understand what she sees; indeed she interprets it completely differently from what it is (won't say more about the scene or it would be spoiled). I believe that scene is there to try to drive home this point.If one can maintain the eyes and mind of a per-pubescent child when viewing the film, and fully appreciate the imagination of a child, then the ability of that imagination to help cope with dire situations and gruesome circumstances will come through as the main element of the film. It's not that she's losing her sanity with the four doll heads, rabbit hole, squirrel and overturned bus wreckage with its fireflies. It's how she's keeping her sanity. The doll characters are not speaking to her, they're her internal dialog as she sorts out what she's seeing, how to interpret it, and what to do. She knows they're not ""real"" and this is subtly demonstrated in several places. That she pretends that her father, Noah, is still alive is a coping mechanism. She wouldn't know what to do or what would happen if he really is dead. She does know mostly how to go about living and take care of herself in the present if he's still alive but on an extended ""vacation"" (how he characterizes his heroin trips). There's no doubt that deep down she realizes he is dead (there are hints of this), just like her mother, but it's easier to ignore and delay acceptance of it until ability to cope with it arises. Those who think her behavior less than sane were NEVER really children and I pity their deprived childhoods. Viewed through adult eyes as an adult results in a superficial experience, completely missing the real depth this film contains, and completely misinterpreting various characters' behaviors. In my opinion, it's why many of those that *hate* this film, do so.Tideland is not the best Gilliam film, but it's not his worst. It contains considerable depth about childhood, its innocence and the true capability of its imagination. It's very sad this film did not see wider theatrical release in the U.S. and that there hasn't been a U.S. Blu-ray release yet, only a German one that fortunately plays in Region A Blu-ray players.",4,Must Be Viewed Through Eyes and Mind of a Child!,1381708800,"10 14, 2013",2013,4130,"['Blu-ray', 'German', 'release', 'automated', 'Germany', 'version', 'industry', 'copyright', 'warning', 'then', 'foreword', 'Terry', 'Gilliam', 'German', 'dubbing', 'voice', 'Use', 'Audio', 'button', 'remote', 'control', 'switch', 'English', 'audio', 'foreword', 'film', 'automatically', 'can', 'use', 'remote', 'go', 'top', 'menu', 'Select', 'English', 'soundtrack', 'turn', 'off', 'German', 'subtitles', 'only', 'available', 'Start', 'playing', 'again', 'Gilliam', 'short', 'foreword', 'basically', 'folks', 'will', 'either', 'love', 'hate', 'film', 'see', 'child', 'would', 'Blu-ray', 'transfer', 'excellent', 'picture', 'quality', 'audio', 'including', '5.1', 'English', '.I', 'agree', 'Gilliam', 'foreword', 'film', 'MUST', 'be', 'viewed', 'keeping', 'mind', 'child', 'Also', 'immensely', 'one', 'childhood', 'had', 'good', 'amount', 'unstructured', 'minimally', 'semi-structured', 'play', 'time', 'relied', 'imagination', 'create', 'things', 'do', 'Sadly', 'too', 'many', 'contemporary', 'childhoods', 'are', 'so', 'structured', '24/7', 'kids', 'imaginations', 'are', 'being', 'crippled', 'grow', 'up', 'relying', 'someone', 'book', 'procedures/rules', 'telling', 'what', 'do', 'how', 'do', 'when', 'do', 'film', 'being', 'able', 'appreciate', '9-year', 'old', 'imagination', 'only', 'thing', 'four', 'doll', 'heads', 'entertain', 'Dell', 'Dickens', 'Too', 'many', 'try', 'read', 'too', 'much', 'friendship', 'girl', 'Jeliza-Rose', 'Dickens', '20-year', 'old', 'retarded', 'boy', 'brain', 'was', 'surgically', 'split', 'reduce', 'epileptic', 'seizures', 'mental', 'age', 'same', 'Jeliza-Rose', 'pre-pubescent', 'play', 'couple', 'scenes', 'more', 'what', ""'ve"", 'observed', 'adults', 'do', 'comprehending', 'only', 'fraction', 'what', 'children', 'do', 'even', 'younger', 'ones', 'Observing', 'mimicking', 'adult', 'behavior', 'not', 'mean', 'fully', 'comprehend', 'evidenced', 'when', 'Jeliza-Rose', 'accidentally', 'Dell', 'grocery', 'delivery', 'boy', 'very', 'clear', 'NOT', 'understand', 'what', 'indeed', 'completely', 'differently', 'what', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'more', 'scene', 'would', 'be', 'spoiled', 'believe', 'scene', 'there', 'try', 'drive', 'home', 'one', 'can', 'maintain', 'eyes', 'mind', 'per-pubescent', 'child', 'when', 'viewing', 'film', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'imagination', 'child', 'then', 'ability', 'imagination', 'help', 'cope', 'dire', 'situations', 'gruesome', 'circumstances', 'will', 'come', 'main', 'element', 'film', 'not', 'losing', 'sanity', 'four', 'doll', 'heads', 'rabbit', 'hole', 'squirrel', 'overturned', 'bus', 'wreckage', 'fireflies', 'how', 'keeping', 'sanity', 'doll', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'speaking', ""'re"", 'internal', 'dialog', 'out', 'what', 'seeing', 'how', 'interpret', 'what', 'do', ""'re"", 'not', 'real', 'subtly', 'demonstrated', 'several', 'places', 'father', 'Noah', 'still', 'alive', 'coping', 'mechanism', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'really', 'dead', 'know', 'mostly', 'how', 'go', 'living', 'take', 'care', 'herself', 'present', 'still', 'alive', 'extended', 'vacation', 'how', 'heroin', 'trips', 'doubt', 'down', 'dead', 'are', 'hints', 'just', 'mother', 'easier', 'ignore', 'delay', 'acceptance', 'ability', 'cope', 'who', 'think', 'behavior', 'less', 'sane', 'were', 'NEVER', 'really', 'children', 'pity', 'deprived', 'childhoods', 'Viewed', 'adult', 'eyes', 'adult', 'results', 'superficial', 'experience', 'completely', 'missing', 'real', 'depth', 'film', 'completely', 'misinterpreting', 'various', 'characters', 'behaviors', 'opinion', 'why', 'many', '*hate*', 'film', 'do', 'so.Tideland', 'not', 'best', 'Gilliam', 'film', 'not', 'worst', 'considerable', 'depth', 'childhood', 'innocence', 'true', 'capability', 'imagination', 'very', 'sad', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'wider', 'theatrical', 'release', 'U.S.', ""n't"", 'been', 'U.S.', 'Blu-ray', 'release', 'yet', 'only', 'German', 'one', 'fortunately', 'Region', 'A', 'Blu-ray', 'players']",Tideland
1032872,A2B9WOSXCU7LDM,B000KB4898,"Jordan ""brainofj72""","[1, 5]","Tideland is preceded by a message from director Terry Gilliam in which he says that the film is seen through the eyes of a child. He asks his adult viewers to forget their preconceived notions and see things normally considered repulsive are innocent in a child's mind.This message sums up the fundamental flaw of Tideland: it is lazy filmmaking. I don't think Gilliam challenged himself here. How easy is it to take a child, place him or her in a repugnant situation, then stick a disclaimer at the beginning of your film asking your audience to forget everything that has been engrained in their minds since birth? Anyone can do that. What needs to be done in order for a film like Tideland to accomplish its goals is for the filmmaker to understand a simple truth: you cannot ask your audience to forget their way of thinking; you have to make them see it in a different way. This is where one must challenge oneself. One must tear at the very fabric of perception and cinematic presentation in order for the audience to see the film as he or she does.This is where Gilliam stumbles, as made all too evident by that pesky disclaimer. The child in this film is Jeliza-Rose, who, throughout the course of this film, undergoes abuse from her mother, helps her father take drugs, witnesses death, mutilation, and sex, and flirts with a mentally disabled man. Of course, this is all innocent to her. Her mother is just her mother, her father takes little vacations, the man is her first boyfriend, and sex...well, she has no idea what sex is. So why, Gilliam, why do you present these things in a way that makes it nearly impossible for almost anyone who is going to be viewing Tideland to see things as Jeliza-Rose does on any genuine level? Of course preconceived notions are going to get in the way! Don't just try to sucker your audience into believing you've made a ""difficult"" film and it's their fault if they don't understand. That's cheap. On the contrary - it's your fault for not forcing them to understand! Feeling the need to precede your film with a type of warning should have set off alarm bells right away. At the very least, stand by your work!Furthermore, Gilliam's approach is inconsistent. While most of the occurrences in the film are filmed as an adult would see them, there are several moments in which the film's world seems to transform - a closet goes on forever, a field becomes a deep sea, dolls' heads float and live. They serve as evidence that Gilliam just might understand the concept of genuinely showing things from a child's perspective. While these moments are strong in and of themselves, they do not fit with the film as a whole and end up causing Tideland to feel incoherent.Now, allow us to forget the matter of perspective. What is it beside that about Tideland that didn't sit well with me? Well, you have to understand that I rate films based primarily on the feeling they evoke in me. Atmosphere, if you will. I found Tideland unpleasant. No, not in the way you're probably thinking. Unpleasant in the sense that Jeliza-Rose's surroundings felt literally dirty. I felt as though I could feel dust clinging to my skin and dirt caking underneath my fingernails. Yuck. And I hate to bring this up again, but if Jeliza-Rose doesn't feel that way, why should I?However, I would like to mention that despite all this, the film's ending is breathtaking. It has a beautiful, almost Fellini-esque grandeur that really moved me.Overall, Tideland is a mess. I did not even mention how irritating Gilliam's directorial style is when he indulges himself, and he is at his most unrestrained here. Mix that with a filmic presentation that doesn't know what it wants to be and one is left with a lazy film thickly coated with the pretense of being ""difficult"". There is nothing difficult about the thoroughly easy Tideland.",2,A Lazy Film That Blames You for Not Liking It,1356048000,"12 21, 2012",2012,3850,"['Tideland', 'preceded', 'message', 'director', 'Terry', 'Gilliam', 'film', 'seen', 'eyes', 'child', 'adult', 'viewers', 'forget', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'see', 'things', 'normally', 'considered', 'repulsive', 'are', 'innocent', 'child', 'mind.This', 'message', 'sums', 'up', 'fundamental', 'flaw', 'Tideland', 'lazy', 'filmmaking', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Gilliam', 'challenged', 'here', 'How', 'easy', 'take', 'child', 'place', 'repugnant', 'situation', 'then', 'stick', 'disclaimer', 'beginning', 'film', 'asking', 'audience', 'forget', 'everything', 'been', 'engrained', 'minds', 'birth', 'Anyone', 'can', 'do', 'What', 'be', 'done', 'order', 'film', 'Tideland', 'accomplish', 'goals', 'filmmaker', 'understand', 'simple', 'truth', 'can', 'not', 'ask', 'audience', 'forget', 'way', 'thinking', 'have', 'make', 'see', 'different', 'way', 'where', 'one', 'must', 'challenge', 'must', 'tear', 'very', 'fabric', 'perception', 'cinematic', 'presentation', 'order', 'audience', 'see', 'film', 'where', 'Gilliam', 'made', 'too', 'evident', 'pesky', 'disclaimer', 'child', 'film', 'Jeliza-Rose', 'who', 'course', 'film', 'undergoes', 'abuse', 'mother', 'father', 'take', 'drugs', 'witnesses', 'death', 'mutilation', 'sex', 'flirts', 'mentally', 'disabled', 'man', 'course', 'innocent', 'mother', 'just', 'mother', 'father', 'little', 'vacations', 'man', 'first', 'boyfriend', 'sex', 'well', 'idea', 'what', 'sex', 'So', 'why', 'Gilliam', 'why', 'do', 'present', 'things', 'way', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'almost', 'anyone', 'who', 'going', 'be', 'viewing', 'Tideland', 'see', 'things', 'Jeliza-Rose', 'genuine', 'level', 'course', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'are', 'going', 'get', 'way', 'Do', ""n't"", 'just', 'try', 'sucker', 'audience', 'believing', ""'ve"", 'made', 'difficult', 'film', 'fault', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'cheap', 'contrary', 'fault', 'not', 'forcing', 'understand', 'Feeling', 'need', 'precede', 'film', 'type', 'warning', 'should', 'have', 'set', 'off', 'alarm', 'bells', 'right', 'away', 'very', 'least', 'stand', 'work', 'Furthermore', 'Gilliam', 'approach', 'inconsistent', 'most', 'occurrences', 'film', 'are', 'filmed', 'adult', 'would', 'see', 'are', 'several', 'moments', 'film', 'world', 'transform', 'closet', 'forever', 'field', 'deep', 'sea', 'dolls', 'heads', 'float', 'live', 'serve', 'evidence', 'Gilliam', 'just', 'might', 'understand', 'concept', 'genuinely', 'showing', 'things', 'child', 'perspective', 'moments', 'are', 'strong', 'do', 'not', 'fit', 'film', 'whole', 'end', 'up', 'causing', 'Tideland', 'feel', 'incoherent.Now', 'allow', 'forget', 'matter', 'perspective', 'What', 'Tideland', 'did', ""n't"", 'sit', 'well', 'Well', 'have', 'understand', 'rate', 'films', 'based', 'primarily', 'feeling', 'evoke', 'Atmosphere', 'will', 'found', 'Tideland', 'unpleasant', 'No', 'not', 'way', ""'re"", 'probably', 'thinking', 'Unpleasant', 'sense', 'Jeliza-Rose', 'surroundings', 'felt', 'literally', 'dirty', 'felt', 'could', 'feel', 'dust', 'clinging', 'skin', 'dirt', 'caking', 'underneath', 'fingernails', 'Yuck', 'hate', 'bring', 'up', 'again', 'Jeliza-Rose', ""n't"", 'feel', 'way', 'why', 'should', 'However', 'would', 'like', 'mention', 'film', 'ending', 'breathtaking', 'beautiful', 'almost', 'Fellini-esque', 'grandeur', 'really', 'moved', 'me.Overall', 'Tideland', 'mess', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'mention', 'how', 'irritating', 'Gilliam', 'directorial', 'style', 'when', 'most', 'unrestrained', 'here', 'Mix', 'filmic', 'presentation', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'be', 'one', 'left', 'lazy', 'film', 'thickly', 'coated', 'pretense', 'being', 'difficult', 'nothing', 'difficult', 'thoroughly', 'easy', 'Tideland']",Tideland

1032875,A2DXOD9HQBE1FL,B000KB4898,"Kevin Rienecker ""Kev""","[8, 10]","Of all his films, Terry Gilliam's Tidelands may - here's a prediction - never find an audience - except, of course, for his die-hard fans, and, possibly, fans of the novel. Right from the get-go, during his introduction on the DVD, even Gilliam seems to realize this, and tries to excuse the fact that his low-budget take on Mitch Cullin's dark and disturbing novel just never clicks.The film follows 9-year old Jeliza-Rose (a pretty amazing performance by Jodelle Ferland), as she gamely struggles through one harrowing trauma after another, her sanity precariously balancing on a bubble-thin lifeline while she cooks up hits for her burnout-junkie ex-rocker dad (Jeff Bridges) and deals with her burnout-junkie mom's insane mood-swings. After Jeliza-Rose witnesses her mother's heroin withdrawal, seizure-fit death, Jeliza-Rose and her dad bolt their trashed apartment, hop on a bus, and head out to her dead grandmother's empty, remote, and decaying old farmhouse.And then things get really strange.Jeliza-Rose accidentally sends Dad on another - permanent - heroin-induced vacation, and she slowly loses her marbles; her child's mind hopelessly tries desperately to cope by exploring the creepy old house while chatting with her only friends: four bodiless doll-heads, each a representation of Jeliza-Rose's cracking psyche. Things actually seem to look up a bit when she meets her uber-crazy neighbor, Dell (who, uh, knew Jeliza-Rose's father when they were young, and decides to use her talent with taxidermy to spruce up his bloated, rotting body), and her brain-damaged, explosive-loving brother, Dickens (another pretty amazing performance, by Brendan Fletcher), who becomes Jeliza-Rose's true love. As in the novel, the most truly disturbing images spring from this relationship.Gilliam and others have described the film (and the novel) as a cross between Psycho and Alice in Wonderland. I'd say it's more like Alice meets the wacky, flesh-eating clan from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Frankly, all that was missing was Leatherface waving around his chainsaw, doing his Leatherface dance while he chases around screaming teenagers.And then there's this: as highlighted by his world-weary attitude in the DVD's several making of documentaries and cast-and-crew interviews, the simple fact is that Gilliam just doesn't seem to enjoy making movies anymore. Burdened with his reputation as a brilliant visionary/ studio killer, here Gilliam just looks completely burnt-out and almost uncaring, especially during the documentary of his filmmaking process, and is barely more his normal maniacally animated self as he defends his choices during the special feature cast and crew interviews. Granted, Tideland was filmed while he was still working on the underwhelming flop, The Brothers Grimm, and, at 64, Gilliam is no spring chicken, so fatigue obviously plays a part; but beyond the difficult subject matter, Tideland is tedious at best, and the rather low budget is apparent; even Gilliam's trademarked touches: the wide lens shots, the insertion of the fantasy elements (that often seem jarringly out of place here), as well as his admitted obsession with pre-teen girl protagonists (Baron Munchausen, anyone?) all serve to distract rather than pull the viewer in - the death-knell for a film based on what is essentially a character study -- however appalling that character's life may be. And as hard as he might try to convince us otherwise, even Gilliam finding his 'inner child' isn't enough for a good film make.",3,Terry Gilliam documents a child's descent into madness...,1179705600,"05 21, 2007",2007,3528,"['films', 'Terry', 'Gilliam', 'Tidelands', 'may', 'here', 'prediction', 'never', 'find', 'audience', 'course', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'possibly', 'fans', 'novel', 'Right', 'get-go', 'introduction', 'DVD', 'even', 'Gilliam', 'realize', 'tries', 'excuse', 'fact', 'low-budget', 'take', 'Mitch', 'Cullin', 'dark', 'disturbing', 'novel', 'just', 'never', 'clicks.The', 'film', '9-year', 'old', 'Jeliza-Rose', 'pretty', 'amazing', 'performance', 'Jodelle', 'Ferland', 'gamely', 'one', 'harrowing', 'trauma', 'sanity', 'precariously', 'balancing', 'bubble-thin', 'lifeline', 'up', 'hits', 'burnout-junkie', 'ex-rocker', 'dad', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'deals', 'burnout-junkie', 'mom', 'insane', 'mood-swings', 'Jeliza-Rose', 'witnesses', 'mother', 'heroin', 'withdrawal', 'seizure-fit', 'death', 'Jeliza-Rose', 'dad', 'bolt', 'trashed', 'apartment', 'hop', 'bus', 'head', 'dead', 'grandmother', 'empty', 'remote', 'decaying', 'old', 'farmhouse.And', 'then', 'things', 'get', 'really', 'strange.Jeliza-Rose', 'accidentally', 'Dad', 'permanent', 'heroin-induced', 'vacation', 'slowly', 'marbles', 'child', 'mind', 'hopelessly', 'desperately', 'cope', 'exploring', 'creepy', 'old', 'house', 'chatting', 'only', 'friends', 'four', 'bodiless', 'doll-heads', 'representation', 'Jeliza-Rose', 'cracking', 'psyche', 'Things', 'actually', 'seem', 'look', 'up', 'bit', 'when', 'uber-crazy', 'neighbor', 'Dell', 'who', 'uh', 'knew', 'Jeliza-Rose', 'father', 'when', 'were', 'young', 'decides', 'use', 'talent', 'taxidermy', 'spruce', 'up', 'bloated', 'rotting', 'body', 'brain-damaged', 'explosive-loving', 'brother', 'Dickens', 'pretty', 'amazing', 'performance', 'Brendan', 'Fletcher', 'who', 'Jeliza-Rose', 'true', 'love', 'novel', 'most', 'truly', 'disturbing', 'images', 'spring', 'relationship.Gilliam', 'others', 'have', 'described', 'film', 'novel', 'cross', 'Psycho', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', ""'d"", 'say', 'more', 'like', 'Alice', 'wacky', 'flesh-eating', 'clan', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'Frankly', 'was', 'missing', 'was', 'Leatherface', 'waving', 'chainsaw', 'doing', 'Leatherface', 'dance', 'screaming', 'teenagers.And', 'then', 'highlighted', 'world-weary', 'attitude', 'DVD', 'several', 'making', 'documentaries', 'cast-and-crew', 'interviews', 'simple', 'fact', 'Gilliam', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'enjoy', 'making', 'movies', 'anymore', 'Burdened', 'reputation', 'brilliant', 'visionary/', 'studio', 'killer', 'here', 'Gilliam', 'just', 'completely', 'burnt-out', 'almost', 'uncaring', 'especially', 'documentary', 'filmmaking', 'process', 'barely', 'more', 'normal', 'maniacally', 'animated', 'self', 'choices', 'special', 'feature', 'cast', 'crew', 'interviews', 'Granted', 'Tideland', 'was', 'filmed', 'was', 'still', 'working', 'underwhelming', 'flop', 'Brothers', 'Grimm', '64', 'Gilliam', 'spring', 'chicken', 'fatigue', 'obviously', 'part', 'difficult', 'subject', 'matter', 'Tideland', 'tedious', 'best', 'rather', 'low', 'budget', 'apparent', 'even', 'Gilliam', 'trademarked', 'touches', 'wide', 'shots', 'insertion', 'fantasy', 'elements', 'often', 'seem', 'jarringly', 'place', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'admitted', 'obsession', 'pre-teen', 'girl', 'protagonists', 'Baron', 'Munchausen', 'anyone', 'serve', 'distract', 'rather', 'pull', 'viewer', 'death-knell', 'film', 'based', 'what', 'essentially', 'character', 'study', 'however', 'appalling', 'character', 'life', 'may', 'be', 'as', 'hard', 'might', 'try', 'convince', 'otherwise', 'even', 'Gilliam', 'finding', ""'inner"", 'child', ""n't"", 'enough', 'good', 'film', 'make']",Tideland

And ""Tideland"" is thusly tempest tossed.Gilliam, with his signature visual sense and non-sense, goes to the jugular of the dichotomy between the brave light we would like ourselves to be, masters of our surroundings and fate, the love and innocence and comfort we wish to hold dear, the desire to be cared for... and the dark dangers and disasters and ghosts and creeping, tragic doubts and failings and frailties in ourselves that can scare us half to death and bring us down and even drive us crazy.Not all children have rich fantasy lives. Not all children are tested early on by such things as the death of a parent, of abandonment, of surreal confusion, of utter isolation and imagination gone wild. And grown-ups tend to turn away from those fantastical riches of childhood. (Some of those adults have expressed their distaste and distress in other reviews of ""Tideland"".) Gilliam is drawn to characters who DO sink and swim in the deep recesses of the raucous, raging, sensual Id.""Tideland"" is challenging and, in a few scenes, disturbing. And it is, in many scenes, lovely and lyrical to see. AND it is a test of each viewer. Those who enjoy ""Tideland"" most, I am sure, are liberal, in the overarching sense of the word, glad to see others try, no matter how much they might disagree -- and able to walk a ways in another man's shoes -- as Atticus said to Scout in ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" just one literary and artistic reference which comes to mind while watching this film. And ""Alice in Wonderland"" doesn't just appear in the film by chance; this is Gilliam's Alice, who was, we should recall, not only a literary character but also a real little girl, on whom the author Lewis Carroll had a rather taboo crush. Yes, here too, as has been said, taboos abound.Artistic endeavors often relish tackling taboos, and Gilliam is an old swashbuckler in this vein. He seems to ask: what wonder would heaven be without the horror, the horror of our darkest trials. He doesn't just rattle the skeletons in our closets, he intends to show we ARE those skeletons.Those viewers who do not shy away from recognizing the fears of youth and being compassionate toward those fears, those who can recall the interplay of fear and relief, of conquering ghosts, of going through hell and being resilient enough to find comfort, to accept love and to come out the other side finding their own sanity both in doubt and enriched, may come to appreciate ""Tideland.""",4,"A challenging, phantasmagorical clash between child id and Gilliam ego",1185926400,"08 1, 2007",2007,2714,"[""'ll"", 'squirm', ""'ll"", 'laugh', ""'ll"", 'be', 'times', 'captivated', 'creativity', 'may', 'even', 'wince', 'may', 'swoon.Co-screenwriter', 'director', 'Terry', 'Gilliam', 'long', 'been', 'fixated', 'phantasmagoria', 'life', 'clash', 'titanic', 'forces', 'Id', 'Ego', 'Tideland', 'thusly', 'tempest', 'tossed.Gilliam', 'signature', 'visual', 'sense', 'non-sense', 'jugular', 'dichotomy', 'brave', 'light', 'would', 'like', 'be', 'masters', 'surroundings', 'fate', 'love', 'innocence', 'comfort', 'wish', 'hold', 'dear', 'desire', 'be', 'cared', 'dark', 'dangers', 'disasters', 'ghosts', 'creeping', 'tragic', 'doubts', 'failings', 'frailties', 'ourselves', 'can', 'scare', 'death', 'bring', 'down', 'even', 'drive', 'crazy.Not', 'children', 'have', 'rich', 'fantasy', 'lives', 'Not', 'children', 'are', 'tested', 'early', 'such', 'things', 'death', 'parent', 'abandonment', 'surreal', 'confusion', 'utter', 'isolation', 'imagination', 'gone', 'wild', 'grown-ups', 'tend', 'turn', 'away', 'fantastical', 'riches', 'childhood', 'adults', 'have', 'expressed', 'distaste', 'distress', 'other', 'reviews', 'Tideland', 'Gilliam', 'drawn', 'characters', 'who', 'DO', 'sink', 'swim', 'deep', 'recesses', 'raucous', 'raging', 'sensual', 'Id', 'Tideland', 'challenging', 'few', 'scenes', 'disturbing', 'many', 'scenes', 'lovely', 'lyrical', 'see', 'test', 'viewer', 'who', 'enjoy', 'Tideland', 'most', 'am', 'sure', 'are', 'liberal', 'overarching', 'sense', 'word', 'glad', 'see', 'others', 'try', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'might', 'disagree', 'able', 'walk', 'ways', 'man', 'shoes', 'Atticus', 'said', 'Scout', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'just', 'one', 'literary', 'artistic', 'reference', 'mind', 'watching', 'film', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', ""n't"", 'just', 'appear', 'film', 'chance', 'Gilliam', 'Alice', 'who', 'was', 'should', 'recall', 'not', 'only', 'literary', 'character', 'also', 'real', 'little', 'girl', 'whom', 'author', 'Lewis', 'Carroll', 'had', 'rather', 'taboo', 'crush', 'Yes', 'here', 'too', 'been', 'said', 'taboos', 'abound.Artistic', 'endeavors', 'often', 'relish', 'tackling', 'taboos', 'Gilliam', 'old', 'swashbuckler', 'vein', 'ask', 'what', 'wonder', 'would', 'heaven', 'be', 'horror', 'horror', 'darkest', 'trials', ""n't"", 'just', 'rattle', 'skeletons', 'closets', 'show', 'ARE', 'skeletons.Those', 'viewers', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'shy', 'away', 'recognizing', 'fears', 'youth', 'being', 'compassionate', 'fears', 'who', 'can', 'recall', 'interplay', 'fear', 'relief', 'conquering', 'ghosts', 'going', 'hell', 'being', 'resilient', 'enough', 'find', 'comfort', 'accept', 'love', 'come', 'out', 'other', 'side', 'finding', 'own', 'sanity', 'doubt', 'enriched', 'may', 'come', 'appreciate', 'Tideland']",Tideland

But the girl does not realize he is dead, and escapes into a world of her own to deal with it, talking to her dolls, imaging things ... as Terry himself said, ""it's like Alice In Wonderland meets Psycho""I'm not sure if it's ""Psycho"" it seems more like ""Alice IWL"" meets the ""Devils Rejects""Along her way she meets a woman named Dell who at first she thinks is a ghost, then thinks she is a witch. And Dells younger retarded brother who she forms an innocent relationship with.A lot of people have said it's sick to have an 9 year old and a 20 year old having a relationship together for a movie. It can be a little disturbing to those who are expecting it to become sexual, but if you really see whats happening here, it's a little innocent girl who has the dream of being beautiful, holding hands, being married, having babies, but does not know how babies are made. And her boyfriend does not seem to know what sex is either, so their kissing is an innocent loved affair that is not sexual, it's from a child's perspective of what lovers do, without even having any knowledge of what the adults really do.The movie further goes into weirdo mode with Dell preserving the child's father so they can keep him around... weird is all i can say about that.The things that happen in this movie are too art-house for my liking. It was watchable, but it's just weird. For art-house fans, this is sure to please that audience.I did not feel the movie was offensive, perverse or sick as some people have said... it's just different and very weird and will appeal to certain audiences and lean towards a boundary that does not get crossed, but puts enough thought into your own mind that you will not be comfortable with it.I think it's getting more down reviews from Monty Python fans who expected it to be a comedy... but you have to keep in mind, Terry Gilliam was the one who did the animations, not the jokes. So he is the visual member of the pythons, not the funny one. So the comedy is not laugh out loud funny in this movie... but at least he is trying to go down another path that does not rely on huge visual shots never seen before.It's hard for me to actually pick what I want to rate this movie. 1 star would be I hated it, which I didn't. 2 stars would be I didn't like it, but I did not hate it. 3 stars would be it was ok, and so on... but I'm stuck somewhere between 2 and 3 stars. So don't look at my rating and think I hated the movie.I can see it it for what it was going for. It's just this movie is not the sort of thing i'm into... but i'm sure the art-house audiences will give it rave reviews. If I thought it was 3 stars and OK, i'd want to see it again, but I don't think I want to see this ever again, but it's not because it's sick or a bad movie, it's just not the sort of thing i'm into.Some of the bonus features are typical Python humor. You may like some of those, but I did not really want to know anything more about this movie, so the interviews where easily skipped by myself when Terry was not part of them.Overall, if you love art-house or weird movies, this one is for you. if your looking for a python like comedy or a sweet drama story, this ain't it.",2,effing wierd,1214956800,"07 2, 2008",2008,3537,"['Being', 'Terry', 'Gilliam', 'film', 'figured', 'would', 'be', 'something', 'funny', 'video', 'store', 'manager', 'said', 'was', 'morbid', 'sense', 'humor', 'so', 'naturally', 'rented', 'it.Tideland', 'girl', 'mother', 'overdose', 'father', 'where', 'grew', 'up', 'out', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'too', 'overdose', 'when', 'get', 'there', 'girl', 'not', 'realize', 'dead', 'world', 'own', 'deal', 'talking', 'dolls', 'imaging', 'things', 'Terry', 'said', 'like', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', 'meets', 'Psycho', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'Psycho', 'more', 'Alice', 'IWL', 'Devils', 'Rejects', 'way', 'woman', 'named', 'Dell', 'who', 'first', 'ghost', 'then', 'witch', 'Dells', 'younger', 'retarded', 'brother', 'who', 'innocent', 'relationship', 'with.A', 'lot', 'people', 'have', 'said', 'sick', 'have', '9', 'year', 'old', '20', 'year', 'old', 'having', 'relationship', 'together', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'disturbing', 'who', 'are', 'expecting', 'become', 'sexual', 'really', 'see', 'whats', 'happening', 'here', 'little', 'innocent', 'girl', 'who', 'dream', 'being', 'beautiful', 'holding', 'hands', 'being', 'married', 'having', 'babies', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'babies', 'are', 'made', 'boyfriend', 'not', 'seem', 'know', 'what', 'sex', 'either', 'kissing', 'innocent', 'loved', 'affair', 'not', 'sexual', 'child', 'perspective', 'what', 'lovers', 'do', 'even', 'having', 'knowledge', 'what', 'adults', 'really', 'do.The', 'movie', 'further', 'weirdo', 'mode', 'Dell', 'preserving', 'child', 'father', 'can', 'keep', 'around', 'weird', 'i', 'can', 'say', 'that.The', 'things', 'happen', 'movie', 'are', 'too', 'art-house', 'liking', 'was', 'watchable', 'just', 'weird', 'art-house', 'fans', 'sure', 'please', 'audience.I', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'movie', 'was', 'offensive', 'perverse', 'sick', 'people', 'have', 'said', 'just', 'different', 'very', 'weird', 'will', 'appeal', 'certain', 'audiences', 'lean', 'towards', 'boundary', 'not', 'get', 'crossed', 'enough', 'thought', 'own', 'mind', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'comfortable', 'it.I', 'think', 'getting', 'more', 'down', 'reviews', 'Monty', 'Python', 'fans', 'who', 'expected', 'be', 'comedy', 'have', 'keep', 'mind', 'Terry', 'Gilliam', 'was', 'one', 'who', 'did', 'animations', 'not', 'jokes', 'visual', 'member', 'pythons', 'not', 'funny', 'one', 'comedy', 'not', 'laugh', 'loud', 'funny', 'movie', 'least', 'trying', 'go', 'down', 'path', 'not', 'rely', 'huge', 'visual', 'shots', 'never', 'seen', 'before.It', 'hard', 'actually', 'pick', 'what', 'want', 'rate', 'movie', '1', 'star', 'would', 'be', 'hated', 'did', ""n't"", '2', 'stars', 'would', 'be', 'did', ""n't"", 'did', 'not', 'hate', '3', 'stars', 'would', 'be', 'was', 'ok', 'so', ""'m"", 'stuck', 'somewhere', '2', '3', 'stars', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'rating', 'think', 'hated', 'movie.I', 'can', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'just', 'movie', 'not', 'sort', 'thing', 'i', ""'m"", 'i', ""'m"", 'sure', 'art-house', 'audiences', 'will', 'give', 'rave', 'reviews', 'thought', 'was', '3', 'stars', 'OK', 'i', ""'d"", 'want', 'see', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'want', 'see', 'ever', 'again', 'not', 'sick', 'bad', 'movie', 'just', 'not', 'sort', 'thing', 'i', ""'m"", 'into.Some', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'typical', 'Python', 'humor', 'may', 'like', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'want', 'know', 'anything', 'more', 'movie', 'interviews', 'where', 'easily', 'skipped', 'when', 'Terry', 'was', 'not', 'part', 'them.Overall', 'love', 'art-house', 'weird', 'movies', 'one', 'looking', 'python', 'comedy', 'sweet', 'drama', 'story', 'ai', ""n't""]",Tideland

1032884,A18SDN3HYFVH2L,B000KB4898,Muzzlehatch,"[8, 9]","I have a history with Terry Gilliam, well with his films anyway. Seeing BRAZIL at its Chicago premiere, early in 1986 on the 2nd date with my first girlfriend was a defining movie moment for me; it was one of a select few modern films that really helped me to appreciate what the medium could do. Also, it was played at an earsplitting volume and it was on one of the biggest screens in the city at the time...all in all an unforgettable experience.So I've loved the director ever since, which makes it rather inexplicable that I waited to this long to see TIDELAND, a film problematic in its release and reception even for Gilliam, who unfortunately has to be used to such things by now. I guess that on a certain level I found the storyline, what I knew of it anyway, rather unnerving and perhaps something I just didn't want to deal with at this moment in my life; and indeed, it is an unnerving, disquieting film - but it is also a film that sucked me in and moved me and consistently kept me enthralled, so it was worth some of the discomfort that I felt throughout. Sometimes a little pain can open us up and get our energies going more than a lot of pleasure.As we open, young Jeliza Rose (Jodelle Ferland) lives with her drug-addict parents, somewhere not really explained....but she really lives in a fantasy-world of ""Alice in Wonderland"" and travel across the sea, made palpable and real when she and her aging rocker daddy Noah (Jeff Bridges) leave her suddenly-dead mother (Jennifer Tilly) for a trip back to Noah's past, in the windswept prairies of Texas. The literary Alice meets the cinematic Land of Oz on the broad prairie landscape as we soon encounter the mad, Wicked-Witch-like Dell (Janet McTeer) and her retarded brother (maybe...?) Dickens (Brendan Fletcher), and the action for the rest of the film revolves around the two dilapidated farmhouses and unspoken mysteries at the heart of childhood and adolescence, forbidden longings and never-revealed secrets that fuel Jeliza Rose's already potent imagination as she retreats into an imaginary and impossible world every bit as potent as those of her drug-addled parents and the mentally challenged pair she meets.I've rarely seen a film that communicates both the beauties and terror of solitude and solitary myth-making, the sadness of a lonely child underpinning that child's forays into invention and recreating her own desolate world.  Ferland is absolutely remarkable, inhabiting not only the overactive and brilliant mind of Jeliza Rose but also her four distinct talking doll heads, who gradually become more and more distinct and ""real"" as Jeliza's world crumbles - seemingly unnoticed - around her.  At the end, it takes a literal explosion of violence to bring Jeliza back to the real world. Maybe.I'm still sorting through my feelings on this; it was at times rather depressing and difficult to watch, perhaps because of what I'm bringing to it at the moment myself, but it's a beautiful film (unfortunately marred by a DVD transfer that cuts the 'scope aspect ratio down to 1.85, God knows why) and it does, in fact, fit in extraordinarily well with Gilliam's overarching theme of the power of fantasy and imagination and its inability to ever be completely squelched by the nature of ordinary, dull reality.  It's far more successful and interesting overall than the higher-profile BROTHERS GRIMM from the same year and it's a terrible shame that it got such a poor release.  The director clearly hasn't lost his touch, which makes me all the more excited about IMAGINARIUM OF DR.

Doing this for ""Tideland"" (2005) is quite a challenge. Personally I really enjoyed the film, but I clearly fall into its relatively narrow target audience and this is one film that does not compromise its vision to expand its viewer base.The first thing to understand is that this is a horror film, it's not a fantasy adventure or a black comedy (although there are arguably some elements from each genre). Jodelle Ferland, who plays the main character, hit the mark about the casting when she said: ""They like to cast me for scary roles. I think it's because they want you to be scared, but also to like the little girl.""I think it is a very scary film, probably even scarier for children, many of whom would find it extremely entertaining even though they probably should not be allowed to watch it. Which is a good way to think about the whole thing; it's a film where those likely to connect with it the strongest are not mature enough to view it. Making its valid target audience those who still view much of the world through the eyes of their internal child.It is an American Gothic version of ""Alice and Wonderland"", and little heroine Jeliza-Rose (Ferland) shares many of Alice's virtues; innocence, courage, curiosity, wonder, kindness, intelligence, courtesy, dignity, and a sense of justice. The main difference is that Jeliza- Rose does not share Alice's irritation with the rude and illogical characters they encounter in their respective wonderlands. Alice is a confident and proper little Victorian girl who expects a certain standard of behavior while Jeliza-Rose is the neglected daughter of two flaming junkies (Jeff Bridges and Jennifer Tilly) who is skilled at making the best of a variety of sucky situations.""Tideland"" has the look (cinematography) and feel of Terrance Malick's ""Days of Heaven"". Both were made by a director who knew how something felt, and found a way to evoke it in us. It is how a child feels when it lives precariously but knows security and joy for brief periods, and then each time that is taken away wipes off the tears and pretends it doesn't hurt. Both stories are told from the point of view of a young girl. In ""Tideland"", ""Days of Heaven's"" voice-over commentary is replaced by the conversations Jeliza-Rose has with her four dolls (really just the heads of dolls) and a squirrel; in which she supplies the all voices. Jeliza-Rose's point of view is strongly reinforced by a child level camera position. Although the camera techniques call attention to themselves it is all at the service of POV.Ferland's performance (to Gilliam's acting for the camera direction) was extraordinary and even Oscar worthy. And the power she brings to the juxtaposition of the film's images is an editor's dream. This stuff is the film's most elemental feature and I cannot imagine anyone enjoying the film if they do not connect with it. Fortunately you can predict your connection just by viewing ""Tideland's"" promotional poster, which shows a very tiny Jeliza-Rose sitting on the branch of gnarled tree, the tree is turned upside down against a Grant Wood style background ( or Andrew Wyeth's 1948 ""Christina's World"" painting).The adult characters are so weird and wild that Jeliza-Rose's inner child sessions with the four dolls' heads she has turned into finger-puppets (Sateen Lips, Glitter Gal, Mystique and Baby Blonde) provide the film's sanest moments.""Tideland"" is an adaptation of Mitch Cullin's 2000 cult novel. After her mother OD's on a mix of methadone and chocolate, a little girl is taken by her father to his boyhood home, an abandoned farmhouse out on the prairie where the only trace of society is the occasional passing train and a very odd brother and sister who live nearby. Soon left to her own devices the girl entertains herself by exploring her grandmother's house and trying to make friends with the weird neighbors.Most everything is shown on a gritty realist level, making the occasional fantasy scenes even more effective. In retrospect, the film and the Jeliza-Rose character, channel a lot from ""To Kill a Mockingbird"", with Ferland playing a disquietingly mad version of Mary Badham's Scout and Brendan Fletcher an energetic Boo Radley.Then again, what do I know?

1032886,A26255E0YUCEAC,B000KB4898,Quiero Cafe,"[8, 22]","Disclaimer: Lifelong Gilliam fan.  And yet, I put the blame for this movie's failure squarely on his head.  First off, for what it has to offer, it is much too long.  Second, it never seems to figure out what it has to offer.  Third, when it realizes this, it resorts to just battering us with ugly stereotypes.  Fourth, it wastes the sincere talents of almost everyone involved.  Specifically the little girl, despite her awful excuse for a southern accent, has to carry the whole movie and does.  Unfortunately, she has to share a lot of screentime with a very unpleasant character who we're supposed to find lovable (I guess) but is just teeth-grittingly grating.  In fact, his appearance was the moment I realized I was hating the movie.  My only hope was that he (Dickens) would disappear soon - such was not to be.  Perhaps this only speaks badly for my own tolerance but there it is.Jeff Lebowski starts out so strong that it's difficult to believe he agreed to spend 3/4 of the movie as a corpse.  A gassy corpse at that.  Gilliam can't get enough of that.  The part should've gone to somebody not so immediately likable, such as Jim Belushi.  As it was, I just kept hoping Lebowski would leap back to life and elevate the movie out of its long slide to sub-mediocrity.The evil-ish female counterpart was played over-the-top, but well, until the inevitable southern stereotype of the Jesus freak emerges.  Somehow it's never enough for Hollywood to have a character be creepy unless they also harbor some sort of Christian fetishism.  In some ways this is stressed as the character's most glaring flaw, above and beyond tanning her loved ones and keeping them around for future resurrection.As an aside I have to beg Hollywood to hire some dialog coaches for southern accents.  I know that it doesn't matter outside of fly-over country, but it is truly grating to have to hear hokeyness pass for our true manner of speaking.  It would be far better to just forgo the accent than to have it done in a manner that sounds like Ignorance 101.  It's funny how many English actresses (and the Scottish actress in No Country) can get this right, whereas Americans have no ear for it at all.  Since George Washington is always portrayed as speaking like a 19th century Shakespearean actor, certainly accuracy can't be that important to movies like ""Tideland"".  (Which is supposed to be Texas, according to the book summary, but is never referenced in the movie.  Convenient.  Got a bunch of sick twisted characters with unbelievable habits?  Just throw them in Texas and anything is possible.  For once I'd like to see the Vermont Chainsaw Massacre).",2,Tedium Is Not The Same As Art,1239580800,"04 13, 2009",2009,2650,"['Disclaimer', 'Lifelong', 'Gilliam', 'fan', 'yet', 'put', 'blame', 'movie', 'failure', 'squarely', 'head', 'First', 'off', 'what', 'offer', 'much', 'too', 'long', 'Second', 'never', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'offer', 'Third', 'when', 'just', 'battering', 'ugly', 'stereotypes', 'Fourth', 'sincere', 'talents', 'almost', 'everyone', 'involved', 'Specifically', 'little', 'girl', 'awful', 'excuse', 'southern', 'accent', 'carry', 'whole', 'movie', 'Unfortunately', 'share', 'lot', 'screentime', 'very', 'unpleasant', 'character', 'who', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'find', 'lovable', 'guess', 'just', 'teeth-grittingly', 'grating', 'fact', 'appearance', 'was', 'moment', 'realized', 'was', 'hating', 'movie', 'only', 'hope', 'was', 'Dickens', 'would', 'disappear', 'soon', 'such', 'was', 'not', 'be', 'Perhaps', 'only', 'badly', 'own', 'tolerance', 'Lebowski', 'out', 'so', 'strong', 'difficult', 'believe', 'agreed', 'spend', '3/4', 'movie', 'corpse', 'gassy', 'corpse', 'Gilliam', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'part', 'should', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'somebody', 'not', 'so', 'immediately', 'likable', 'such', 'Jim', 'Belushi', 'was', 'just', 'kept', 'hoping', 'Lebowski', 'would', 'leap', 'back', 'life', 'elevate', 'movie', 'long', 'slide', 'sub-mediocrity.The', 'evil-ish', 'female', 'counterpart', 'was', 'played', 'over-the-top', 'well', 'inevitable', 'southern', 'stereotype', 'Jesus', 'freak', 'emerges', 'Somehow', 'never', 'enough', 'Hollywood', 'have', 'character', 'be', 'creepy', 'also', 'harbor', 'sort', 'Christian', 'fetishism', 'ways', 'stressed', 'character', 'most', 'glaring', 'flaw', 'tanning', 'loved', 'ones', 'keeping', 'future', 'resurrection.As', 'aside', 'have', 'beg', 'Hollywood', 'hire', 'dialog', 'coaches', 'southern', 'accents', 'know', ""n't"", 'matter', 'fly-over', 'country', 'truly', 'grating', 'have', 'hear', 'hokeyness', 'pass', 'true', 'manner', 'speaking', 'would', 'be', 'far', 'better', 'just', 'forgo', 'accent', 'have', 'done', 'manner', 'Ignorance', '101', 'funny', 'how', 'many', 'English', 'actresses', 'Scottish', 'actress', 'No', 'Country', 'can', 'get', 'right', 'whereas', 'Americans', 'have', 'ear', 'George', 'Washington', 'always', 'portrayed', 'speaking', '19th', 'century', 'Shakespearean', 'actor', 'certainly', 'accuracy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'important', 'movies', 'Tideland', 'Which', 'supposed', 'be', 'Texas', 'according', 'book', 'summary', 'never', 'referenced', 'movie', 'Convenient', 'Got', 'bunch', 'sick', 'twisted', 'characters', 'unbelievable', 'habits', 'Just', 'throw', 'Texas', 'anything', 'possible', 'once', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'Vermont', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre']",Tideland

""If it's shocking, it's because it's innocent."" {You'll know what I mean when you see it}. And it is true, you will either love it or you will hate it. It's easy to tell why for both reasons. He directs a very interesting and creative interpretation of Alice in Wonderland. I personally liked it a lot, and it's very interesting to see a modern, twisted version of Wonderland as a child's odd imagination: Throughout Tideland, Jeliza-Rose is kept company by her doll's heads on her fingers while roaming the prarie looking for imaginative adventure. She gets more than she bargained for after meeting some strange people with even stranger intentions. Not only that, but reality becomes ancient history with the stuff she experiences because of her ""over-spontaneous"" imagination and a few squirrels...I also thoroughly enjoyed the interview with Terry Gilliam on the second special features DVD. He talked about the tough times in making the film, and he talks about the easy ones, and he also speaks about working with the actors. It can be funny that even he forgot certain aspects about the details of the film, such as the names of Jeliza-Rose's doll heads.If you keep an open mind about Tideland, you're bound to enjoy it as much as I did with some quite amazing performances.

It's very ""messed up"", so in a way I guess it is a horror movie. The beginning wasn't too bad, when it started reaching the incline of the plot, it started getting a bit disturbing... then more disturbing... and a little more... But the ending made it better. I was very afraid to watch this movie after seeing the previews it had (since I'm used to previews being like the movie itself) and seeing all the warnings here on amazon and even from the director at the beginning of the movie. Again, to some this may indeed be disturbing because there is ***SPOILER*** drug use, mental illness, neglect I suppose, sex (though only one scene and its not very graphic like you typically see here in Hollywood), and a bit of pedophile behavior (though the girl is not harmed, she does not use drugs and is not sexually molested or raped or something like that. There also is no physical abuse just neglect really. I was afraid that there would be physical abuse or something sexually happening to the girl, but I was relieved that there was not (I would have stopped watching if there was, I just can't handle that stuff.))Overall though, I am glad I watched it. It kind of makes me thankful for my life now, and putting myself in the girl's shoes, for me would just be terrible.

1032895,AJ9W09EUQPAKE,B000KB4898,Sirin,"[5, 14]","In the brief introduction, a wild eyed Terry Gilliam explains that as a 64 year old filmmaker he finally found his inner child (a little girl) in order to make this movie adaptation of the Mitch Cullin novel. As expected, Terry Gilliam's inner child is not your average suburban milquetoast - but this is really something else. Jeliza Rose lives with her junkie parents in a remote delapidated farmhouse on some namless prairie. A mix up with some methodone/heroin leads to her mother's death at the start of the movie. Her father (Jeff Bridges - think 'The Dude' from The Big Lebowski only several stages more advanced in his stupor) takes her on a brief wild tour, but soon settles back into his soporific routine of 'vacations' - for 90 percent of the movie he is either a corpse, or tantamount to that, mute in his chair with Jeliza periodically assisting him with his torniquet and injections.So it's fair to say that Jeliza-Rose doesn't have ideal family circumstances. In fact, she is better off once both parents have departed. She is the typical introverted, lonely imaginative child - only much more so. She acts out hollywood actress scenes in front of her mirror, she befriends her headless barbie dolls (and spends interminable amounts of time in the movie talking to them), names fireflies, shudders in the hulk of a ruined car while trains rattle by. Eventually she encounters the just as bizarre Dell, a witch like figure dressed in black, with a beekeepers veil and a bee stung missing pupil in her right eye. Dell adopts the frightened Jeliza-Rose as a dysfunctional surrogate mother, and Jeliza enters into her world, including a friendship with Dell's brother Dicken's, a retarded epileptic who tallies with Jeliza's imaginative games, and even enters into a form of childish, Lolitaesque boyfriend/girlfriend relationship - 'silly kisser' Jeliza giggles when Dickens proffers his trembling lips to hers.The paedophilia is not the disturbing aspect of the movie. The complete mishmash of ideas and themes, surrealism without much of a moral purpose other than to satisfy Gilliam's curious inner child reclamation. The movie is a classic visual spectacle, with some eye spiralling rapid camera work and visceral detail - especially concerning Jeliza's father's rotting corpse.

Sadly, this seems to be the pattern whenever Hollywood tries to subvert the influence of a true cinematic genius.  Then word leaked out he was simultaneously working on an independently financed film that would see release soon afterward.  Wow, to say this movie is out there is an understatement.

Jeliza-Rose loses both parents, lives in a house of squalor, spends all days talking to her dolls' heads, and then meets a disturbed woman and her mentally challenged brother, who dreams of destroying a train which he imagines to be a monster shark.Some viewers will be put off by Bridges' heroin shooting and the treatment of his corpse, while others will find Dickins' attraction to Jeliza distasteful at best.  And I am left wondering if Jeliza has had a psychotic break by the end.Bear in mind that this is rated R for very good reasons.

Both of them die early in the movie, leaving the child to herself in a remote, worn down, shell-of-a-house.From there, the movie features the child talking to her doll heads. Actually, she mumbles a lot, saying nothing of importance.If you find 90 minutes of a girl talking to her dolls fun, this film is for you. I found it incredibly dull, to the point where my mind wandered early and often. There was nothing going on, and nothing important being said (unless you were the child's doll).This movie is so dull the director opens up before hand stating ""you might not like this movie.""

1032909,A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ,B000KB4898,"Z. Freeman ""Zach""","[3, 4]","Based on the novel of the same name by Mitch Cullin, Tideland is a beautiful and disturbing look into the mind of a little girl with the strangest lifestyle ever put on the screen. The opening sets the tone of the rest of the film: Terry Gilliam, in black and white, explains that many people will find his film too disturbing and not like it. He may be right, but others will love it.When 11-year-old Jeliza-Rose's mother (a frighteningly cracked-out Jennifer Tilly) dies of a heroin overdose, she flees with her father (an equally cracked out Jeff Bridges) on a Greyhound bus to an old abandoned house in west Texas. Soon after, Jeliza-Rose's father meets the same fate as her mother, leaving her alone (except for her playmates: four barbie-doll heads she wears on her fingers and converses with) in the middle of nowhere.This is when she meets her new neighbors: Dell, a witchlike woman with a fear of bee-stings, and her mentally retarded brother Dickens, who wears flippers and scuba gear in order to ""swim"" through the grass fields. Dickens also hunts the giant ""shark"" that comes down the railroad tracks.If this sounds like the kind of story you're intersted in, then jump right in. The cinematography is gorgeous and every frame is stunning. The way the movie flows is comparable to how Jeliza-Rose's disturbed mind interprets it all.  Because of this flow, at times the movie seems to drag. The plot doesn't feel to be moving along. What's strange is that the result of this turns out to attract as much as repel. Viewers can find themselves pulled into this twisting, tumbling world that Jeliza-Rose lives in, or find themselves pushing away when the situation becomes too disturbing.There are parts that are downright painful to watch, but they are presented with such blatant naivete that it almost feels as if the normalcy of the situation is taken for granted by both the characters and the filmmakers, which is a strange sensation to behold.There is an entire second disc of extras, including a short film entitled ""Getting Gilliam"" which provides insight into the mind of Terry Gilliam. Chances are, after watching Tideland, you may have had enough of his mind for a while, but there's some interesting stuff there. Tideland is a poignant, beautiful film, but probably not one you'll want to watch again and again.",3,Beautiful and disturbing look at a young girl's life,1175472000,"04 2, 2007",2007,2332,"['Based', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Mitch', 'Cullin', 'Tideland', 'beautiful', 'disturbing', 'look', 'mind', 'little', 'girl', 'strangest', 'lifestyle', 'ever', 'put', 'screen', 'opening', 'tone', 'rest', 'film', 'Terry', 'Gilliam', 'black', 'white', 'many', 'people', 'will', 'find', 'film', 'too', 'disturbing', 'not', 'may', 'be', 'right', 'others', 'will', 'love', 'it.When', '11-year-old', 'Jeliza-Rose', 'mother', 'frighteningly', 'cracked-out', 'Jennifer', 'Tilly', 'heroin', 'overdose', 'father', 'equally', 'cracked', 'out', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Greyhound', 'bus', 'old', 'abandoned', 'house', 'west', 'Texas', 'Soon', 'Jeliza-Rose', 'father', 'same', 'fate', 'mother', 'leaving', 'alone', 'playmates', 'four', 'barbie-doll', 'heads', 'fingers', 'converses', 'middle', 'nowhere.This', 'when', 'new', 'neighbors', 'Dell', 'witchlike', 'woman', 'fear', 'bee-stings', 'mentally', 'retarded', 'brother', 'Dickens', 'who', 'flippers', 'scuba', 'gear', 'order', 'swim', 'grass', 'fields', 'Dickens', 'also', 'giant', 'shark', 'down', 'railroad', 'tracks.If', 'kind', 'story', ""'re"", 'intersted', 'then', 'jump', 'right', 'cinematography', 'gorgeous', 'frame', 'stunning', 'way', 'movie', 'comparable', 'how', 'Jeliza-Rose', 'disturbed', 'mind', 'interprets', 'flow', 'times', 'movie', 'drag', 'plot', ""n't"", 'feel', 'be', 'moving', 'along', 'What', 'strange', 'result', 'out', 'attract', 'as', 'much', 'repel', 'Viewers', 'can', 'find', 'pulled', 'twisting', 'tumbling', 'world', 'Jeliza-Rose', 'lives', 'find', 'pushing', 'away', 'when', 'situation', 'too', 'disturbing.There', 'are', 'parts', 'are', 'downright', 'painful', 'watch', 'are', 'presented', 'such', 'blatant', 'naivete', 'almost', 'normalcy', 'situation', 'taken', 'granted', 'characters', 'filmmakers', 'strange', 'sensation', 'behold.There', 'entire', 'second', 'disc', 'extras', 'including', 'short', 'film', 'entitled', 'Getting', 'Gilliam', 'insight', 'mind', 'Terry', 'Gilliam', 'Chances', 'are', 'watching', 'Tideland', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'enough', 'mind', 'while', 'interesting', 'stuff', 'there', 'Tideland', 'poignant', 'beautiful', 'film', 'probably', 'not', 'one', ""'ll"", 'want', 'watch', 'again', 'again']",Tideland
