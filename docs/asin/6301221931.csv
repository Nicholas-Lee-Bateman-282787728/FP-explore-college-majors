I have been waiting for this movie to arrive on DVD ever since the 80's ended. If anyone is down or needs a good laugh then this is the movie to watch. Rebecca and Mary Gross have excellent comedic timing, especially Gross. She says some of the most random things that are way out in left field and it does nothing but evoke laughter.Rebecca & Mary are 2 field trainees attending school to become FBI agents. Rebecca is street smart and physically trained while Mary is a bookworm, but doesn't have the EDGE she needs to make it all the way. These two women are two halves that complete one another and form a bond as roommates. This movie is complete laughter from start to finish and goes at a great pace. Sometimes i am shocked at how quickly it ends. The price tag is a bit hefty on Amazon, but pick up this DVD. It's a total winner.",5,CLASSIC!

Zuckermann gets stepped on from time to time cause they feel she can't cut it, until she finally takes up for herself.  Sen. Fred Dalton Thompson of Tennessee stars in this he had also been in another movie DIE HARD 2 with Bruce Willis, in this he plays Bulleki the headmaster of the FBI School.

Mary Gross as her bumbling partner and now presidential candidate Fred Thompson as their chief instructor.  The laughs come, however, not at a brisk pace but this is definitely one of those movies you can watch more than once just for the entertainment value. I whole-heartedly reccomend this movie.
