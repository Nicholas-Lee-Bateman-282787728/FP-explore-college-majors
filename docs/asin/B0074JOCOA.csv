I couldn't believe that a movie with so many great actors could be so bad. Well, this movie was awesome! This movie is for the more sophisticated thinkers. Everything isn't right in your face, so that's why I understand why some don't get the message and why it has bad reviews. But this movie is about real life and what we all go through in our relationships. Please watch! You won't regret it. ;)",5,Great movie!,1362873600,"03 10, 2013",2013,480,"['seeing', 'negative', 'reviews', 'movie', 'just', 'had', 'watch', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'movie', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'actors', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'bad', 'Well', 'movie', 'was', 'awesome', 'movie', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'thinkers', 'Everything', ""n't"", 'right', 'face', 'why', 'understand', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'message', 'why', 'bad', 'reviews', 'movie', 'real', 'life', 'what', 'go', 'relationships', 'Please', 'watch', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret']",Contradictions Of The Heart

I am seeing a lot of films lately that are very similar in plot (or so they try to be).  Showing several different couples (people) with issues (relationship, etc) and then you have the one that has it together, etc, etc, etc.  This one was not very funny, where it should have been and I really wasn't feeling the bar scenes.  Just not very good.

This line is spoken in the beginning and it pretty much explains what this film is about; people speaking words that contradict their actions.Characters are interacting with each other in ways that eventually brings the truth to light. There were scenes I liked and scenes I didn't like. The scenes in Michael's (Christopher B. Duncan) restaurant were the most interesting, especially the conversation between Kim (Wendy Raquel Robinson) and Lester (Mike Dolan). Less profanity may have helped me to enjoy the movie more than I did, but it was good that the sex scenes weren't too graphic. The film deals with issues like betrayal, marital problems, friendship, low self-esteem, and self-awareness.The dialogue is this movie's greatest strength; quite a bit of it leaves the viewer with something to think about.
