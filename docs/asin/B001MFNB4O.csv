1217079,A2LX00K9K8Q6Q3,B001MFNB4O,,"[0, 2]","It takes alot to survive in the city.  And ""The Midnight Meat Train"" Proves this.  There is so much in this movie that shows just how Screwed up of a brain that Clive Barker has, and the Incredibly Ingenious Mind that he has as well to come up with these kinds of stories.  When you start this movie it seems just like your Everyday movie.  That Idea disappears Extremely Quickly, once you see the First Killing.  Not many people have the Wherewithal to kill someone with a Huge Metal Hammer, and a Meathook.  This is one of those movies that just takes you on a journey, that is Very Deeply Rooted in the Darkness of Everyday experiences.  The deaths in this movie are Very Disturbing, and Unforgettable.  There is Gore Aplenty, but not only that but there are several Twists that will keep you going back for more.  After watching this movie you may have Second thoughts about getting on another Subway Train in the middle of the night.  Once you watch this movie you will understand why I say that.  It has made me look at Subways a little different for sure.  Not to say that I will never ride one Again, but I think I will be looking over my back for a little while when I am On One.  It is Very Seriously Disturbing in more ways than one.  Only Clive Barker can make a movie where you will think twice before you follow someone with a Camera.  When you see something Very Disturbing your mind always seems to remember it in ways that you will never forget.  The Main Character in this movie learns this in a Very Strange and disturbing way.  His Girlfriend wants him to take Pictures of her in very Seductive Poses, But there is only one problem there, He keeps seing some of the more disturbing things he has witnessed through the eye of his Camera.  There is nothing like that to kill the mood of trying to take seductive pictures of your girlfriend.  Some of the things the main character has to go through in the course of this movie would make alot of people want to Run in Fear and Hide Anywhere out of sight.  At least I would.  There is a little bit of a Cat and Mouse Game in here as well.  This IS Based on a Clive Barker story from his ""Books Of Blood"" Series of Short Stories.  The First Story in the First Volume of the Series from what I understand.  This movie has made me Curious Enough to want to look up the Book Series and read more of Clive's Work.  I have read a good bit of his stuff, and I know for a fact that some of his stuff is Very Screwed Up, and Dark.  This is a Perfect Example of his Deeply Dark work.  Hellraiser was just a small Taste of what he is Capable of.  In My Opinion this will join ""Hellraiser"" and ""Candyman"" for a place in some of his Best Works for the Screen.  There aren't very many movies where you have a Killer that doesn't speak a Single Word, But still finds a way of being Very Creepy, and Scary.  This movie is able to carry that off and Very Well.  As Surprise Endings go, This has a Very Well Done Surprise Ending that will have you Rewinding it to Rewatch JUST the Ending so you can actually WRAP your HEAD Around it.  It Truly Throws you for a Big Loop.  Just get the movie and Submit to one of the most Intense Movie Experiences that you will Probably ever See.",5,OMG...

The title is awesome and awesomely bad, but this flick is destined to chug forcefully into cult status.You've got the solemn, mysterious killer who wears a suit and clubs passengers in the cranium with a lethal meat tenderizer.  The murders are just phenomenal.  The director doesn't go for gritty realism, there's an abundance of ruby red CGI blood spewage that splatters the screen.  Very stylistic and remarkable.The plot develops pretty well, with nice characterization mixed in with the great mystery and brutality.  The acting is stellar, plus the cinematography is astounding and creative.But this does have quite a dynamic plot twist that seems pretty improbable.  I don't want to give anything away, but it is pretty extreme.  I often like stories that have a major transformation, like HIGH TENSION or FROM DUSK TIL DAWN.

The film is crispy shot and edited (props to the overall competence behind the camera). The acting is pretty good as well. In fact, I found myself jiving along to the atmospheric ride for most of the way. The plot details a photographer's obsession with finding out the identity of a strange butcher who happens to spend his nights smacking in skulls on the titular train. Bradley Cooper (of Wedding Crashers and the Hangover fame) is pretty likable as Leon, even after he starts his transformation about halfway into the movie. Things take some strange turns, and he grows less likable. The movie delves into bleak territory pretty head-on, don't expect a happy ending. I don't really have a problem with this, coming from Clive Barker. What did stick out was the use of CG Gore to show people's eyeballs popping out, etc. These effects could have been handled practically (see DEAD ALIVE-the best gore film ever made) for greater impact. As it is, under the blue filter, these scenes seem out of video-game territory.

So when I heard that it was going to be turned into a feature film, I was quite looking forward to it. But I have to admit that I was hoping that Clive Barker wouldn't be directing it because I'm not a fan of the films he's directed in the past. He's only the producer for Midnight Meat Train. I feel that that's what saved this movie in a lot of ways.Also at times it felt like the midnight train movie could've turned out to be one of those badly made horror flicks. The acting was weak at certain points in the film but the action and suspense made up for it in the end.The film overall isn't all that bad. If you're a Cliver Barker fan then this is for you. If you're not then this can still be an entertaining ride. For me, it's one of those movies that I saw once and don't need to bother with it again.

1217098,A2DLW47JXRLUTP,B001MFNB4O,"Michael D. Sepesy ""egaeus""","[0, 1]","Unfortunately, a market exists for films that offer nothing but gore like Midnight Meat Train, which adapts a Clive Barker story. I was in the library once looking for a video and some creepy, grungy guy staggered in as if from a bar at one in the afternoon and asked the librarian, ""You got anything with some gore?"" That was apparently his one criterion. He is now what I envision as the audience for this sort of film.An element frequent in Barker's short stories is a theme--not a moral, but some type of point the story appears to be getting at other than to nauseate you, and he used extreme imagery to make that point. Midnight Meat Train keeps the slop and discards the soul.  It's as if the filmmakers asked themselves, ""How can we stuff as many unpleasant images into a film as possible without it actually interesting the audience."" Ultimately, this is a slow, non-scary slasher film (except we know who the killer is) with some different bits tacked on at the end so the movie isn't too identical to everything that's come before it.I am not a fan of the slasher genre, which is a repetitive bore, and this film follows that tradition.  Guy is murdering people. Eventually there is a fight to stop him.  As usual, the film especially slavers as it lingers over the mutilation deaths of attractive women. If that sort of thing is appealing to you, your money is better spent enlisting the help of a good psychologist.Eventually, at the very tail end of the film, an interesting fact becomes known, but by then, it's too late.  The one point of interest is then smeared with the excrement of a nihilistic bleak ending that I guess is an attempt to ""get at"" something without actually doing so. When this movie originally came out, it got lousy reviews and having seen the whole thing, I must concur.",1,A poor adaptation of a Clive Barker story,1344038400,"08 4, 2012",2012,1809,"['Unfortunately', 'market', 'films', 'offer', 'nothing', 'gore', 'Midnight', 'Meat', 'Train', 'Clive', 'Barker', 'story', 'was', 'library', 'once', 'looking', 'video', 'creepy', 'grungy', 'guy', 'staggered', 'as', 'bar', 'one', 'afternoon', 'asked', 'librarian', 'got', 'anything', 'gore', 'was', 'apparently', 'one', 'criterion', 'now', 'what', 'envision', 'audience', 'sort', 'film.An', 'element', 'frequent', 'Barker', 'short', 'stories', 'theme', 'not', 'moral', 'type', 'point', 'story', 'be', 'getting', 'other', 'nauseate', 'used', 'extreme', 'imagery', 'make', 'point', 'Midnight', 'Meat', 'Train', 'slop', 'discards', 'soul', 'filmmakers', 'asked', 'How', 'can', 'stuff', 'many', 'unpleasant', 'images', 'film', 'possible', 'actually', 'interesting', 'audience', 'Ultimately', 'slow', 'non-scary', 'slasher', 'film', 'know', 'who', 'killer', 'different', 'bits', 'tacked', 'end', 'movie', ""n't"", 'too', 'identical', 'everything', 'come', 'it.I', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'slasher', 'genre', 'repetitive', 'bore', 'film', 'tradition', 'Guy', 'murdering', 'people', 'Eventually', 'fight', 'stop', 'usual', 'film', 'especially', 'slavers', 'mutilation', 'deaths', 'attractive', 'women', 'sort', 'thing', 'appealing', 'money', 'better', 'spent', 'enlisting', 'help', 'good', 'psychologist.Eventually', 'very', 'tail', 'end', 'film', 'interesting', 'fact', 'known', 'then', 'too', 'late', 'one', 'point', 'interest', 'then', 'smeared', 'excrement', 'nihilistic', 'bleak', 'ending', 'guess', 'attempt', 'get', 'something', 'actually', 'doing', 'so', 'When', 'movie', 'originally', 'came', 'out', 'got', 'lousy', 'reviews', 'having', 'seen', 'whole', 'thing', 'must', 'concur']",The Midnight Meat Train

1217102,A3UA046AA3DXFD,B001MFNB4O,Sid the Elf,"[0, 1]","The Midnight Meat Train was an Ondemand leftover that Sid decided to jump on like it was a desperate actress with bad hair, teeth and a bad pink negligee as part of our October Horrorgreatsuccess. We really knew nothing at all about the film, and from the title, we blindly assumed it was an older flick. But then we saw Brooke Shields and Sack Lodge so we knew this was new school B. Like, it was shown on a mere 100 screens in its theatrical release then quickly put out on DVD B. That's what we were dealing with.What bothers Sid as much as just about anything is potential unfulfilled. This movie was full of it, not good times. This started out as an awesome movie. Great premise, a subway that you get on but you don't leave unless its as a piece of Mario or Luigi Scallopini. Really cool killer(the big guy from Gone in 60 seconds). And to top it all off a killer female lead. Well, not her acting, but Leslie Bibb is a smokeshow. This leads us to problem number 1: How did Cooper not make her his mother-in-law in the first scene? That's not B at all. Problem number 2 was a huge lag in the middle that made this one seem about 3 hours long. Not cool when Sid was primed for some pranking, video games, and Monday Night Football.The Midnight Meat Train was a decent movie that could have been really great horror. Another strike against it, it was bad horror but not really B. There's a huge difference. It ad some cheesy effects but not enough to make it B. Maybe it was Cooper's character's stupidity/wussiness. Maybe it was Leslie Bibb not giving us a full show. Whatever it was, this one didn't have it. This one would have been kept on the whole time in the old days with no payout.
