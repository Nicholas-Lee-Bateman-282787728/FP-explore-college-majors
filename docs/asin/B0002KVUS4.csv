839582,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B0002KVUS4,Acute Observer,"[1, 1]","Little House on the Prairie - Season 6The original nine books could never have provided enough material for the nine TV seasons. New stories were created that continued the original characters, as with other TV shows. The real question is: how authentically did they follow the original stories? Some fans of the original books were disappointed by these TV adaptions. New characters were introduced. Hollywood changes books to condense and simplify them to fit into the allotted time slots and reach a wider audience. These books were written in the mid 1930s from her personal experiences which no historian can match. Laura lost her life savings in the Great Depression. An adult who reads Laura's books can see things that a teenager may miss. The economic depressions of their era are referenced implicitly by the family migrations. Young Laura would have little knowledge of these problems. An older Laura censored events that were not suitable for children's books. This was NBC's highest rated series during most of its nine years. Here are the titles of the twenty-four shows.Disc 1.Back to School, Part 1.  Back to School, Part 2.Family Tree.  Third Miracle.Disc 2.Annabelle.  Preacher Takes a Wife.Halloween Dream.  Return of Mr. Edwards.Disc 3.The King is Dead.  Faith Healer.Author, Author.  Crossed Connection.Disc 4.Angry Heart.

Just print that on the box and booklet, and use the worst possible 17th-generation copies of the episodes to press onto DVDs! I remember watching the features on George Lucas' Star Wars, and how they painstakingly remastered each frame of those original movies. Well that wasn't done here. Imavision is the worst company I have ever seen, I hope their entire DVD staff is fired and put to work on the fry vats at a burger joint.My thanks to the reviewers who filled in the blanks on this excellent season, such as why Mrs. Garvey was written off the series in such a... crispy fashion, poor thing.

I really don't need to express to you how wonderful Little House on the Prairie is, but season 6 is certainly no exception.  If you're fan, why are you reading this? I love this collection and these shows are still good enough to go back to prime time, I'm so bummed out there is no quality stuff like this on the tube anymore.Be that as it may, take care of that issue and go out and buy this now. The box sets of all these DVD's are absolutely fantastic, I love to go back from season to season and see everyone grow and notice the changes in Walnut Grove. This big season Laura falls in love with Almonzo and the most rememembered, however disheartening episode, is when the blind school is burned down and Alice Garvey dies and Mary loses her baby in the fire. I still get shivers and cry during this episode everytime.  I found out that the character ""Alice"" Garvey wanted to give up the role as Alice and start a family--- so no time for acting, so what do they do? They burn her alive! Nice grand exit Alice, anyway, I think the collection is of 12-13 episodes, with some interviews with Alison Engram (Nellie) and the reverend Alden. The picture and sound is fine for the most part, although I noticed some ""audio"" distortions in  some of the episodes, it sounds like the music was coming from the rear end of a cow, but it's only noticeable on a few episodes.

This is the season when we first meet Almanzo Wilder(Manny) and the beginning of Laura's crush which really was love at first sight. Almanzo doesn't know she exists which leads to some very interesting predicaments. Who could forget the Cinnamon Chicken with a little extra spice or Almanzo 'rescuing' ""Beth"" (Laura Elizabeth) from Nellie? The season climax is the resolution for Laura's love for Almanzo which is really quite sweet. Melissa Gilbert grows up before our eyes during this season, but we have to wait until the 7th season before they get married. This is also the season when Rev. Alden gets married, and also when, through the episode of Annabelle, that they tackle the sensitive issue of being overweight and loving someone for what they have on the inside. I am hoping that the 3 part Thanksgiving series will also be included with this DVD. I am glad to see that there are some extra features as well.

The series seems to have lost its foundation and are now making episodes that are set in 1979 but wearing  long dresses.I was repulsed by the moral message of 'The Werewolf of Walnut Grove.'  Apparently the only way to deal with violence is to get everybody on your side and start kicking.  What happened to love thy neighbour?  Do unto others?  I thought that boy would be killed at the end- this is how it could have happened.  This is not behaviour I want my children to emulate.  The mean song sung by the bully was in fact written by the real Laura, who hated Eliza and played on her weaknesses.For some reason many of the scenes intended to be moving left me cold and I hardly know why.  In 'May We Make Them Proud' I have no idea what anybody was doing to make anybody proud.  The scene where Alice and the baby died was horrifically graphic.  Why did Mary leave the baby behind in the first place- she was right next to him.  Mary thrusting her arms through the broken glass was also gratuitous and disgusting.  Everybody whinged about the size of Mrs Olesen's plaque, then they bought one exactly the same size.A greenbroke horse drives for a little girl but not a man?Mrs Olesen sits with her skirt up to her knees and her legs apart- is she a prostitute?Ma was 30 when she had her second child?  This was extremely old in those times.  She went to college?  Charles would have been lucky to make it past eighth grade, for a woman to go to college? Rare.Ma tolerated a drunk in her house?Ma has lost her manners.  Pa has lost his faith. The mantelpiece hasn't been cleaned since they moved in.And Nellie has so many wrinkles around her eyes she looks like Baby Jane.I didn't enjoy this season.

Connors,"[17, 21]","I can say very little to add more weight to what other reviewers say about what a great show 'Little House on the Prairie' is and how glad I am that it has arrived on DVD.Like so many of you though, I am rather shocked and saddened by the poor quality of the source material on the discs.It is clear to me that no remastering has been done at all.  The programmes appear to have been transferred straight across from analogue broadcast tapes (I work in television in the UK).  Tape dropout is evident on some of the episodes so I would imagine the source to be a 1"" or Betacam SP master.  Remastering is when you go back to the original 35mm film negatives and make a fresh film print or digital tape master from that negative, colour correct it scene by scene and paint out any dirt or scratches using modern computer software.  I would love the producers of these DVDs to offer some kind of explanation as to why the barest minimum effort has been put in.  I can live with a few scratches and jumps as long as all the episode content is there and the picture is sharp and colourful, but many purchasers are reporting episdoes with missing scenes, which for a collectors boxset, is appalling.The main fault could lie with Worldvision, the distributors of the series who may have supplied duff ex-broadcast master tapes.  Again though I'm sure all would agree that it is down to the video company to check them, and if they are poor or edited, send them back and demand better ones.  You only need to check the run time to see if it is short.  After all people are paying money for these discs.The original runs of 'Little House' in the UK were broadcast directly from 35mm film prints and so the quality was always nice.  It is only since the latter part of the 1980's when distributors began supplying film series on videotape that the quality problems started, especially if converting from the USA's NTSC television system to the UK's PAL.  Analogue NTSC was absolute rubbish and accounts for the washed out pictures you are now encountering on these DVD's.",3,"Great Show, Bad Quality",1100044800,"11 10, 2004",2004,2061,"['can', 'say', 'very', 'little', 'add', 'more', 'weight', 'what', 'other', 'reviewers', 'say', 'what', 'great', 'show', ""'Little"", 'House', 'Prairie', 'how', 'glad', 'am', 'arrived', 'DVD.Like', 'so', 'many', 'am', 'rather', 'shocked', 'saddened', 'poor', 'quality', 'source', 'material', 'discs.It', 'clear', 'remastering', 'been', 'done', 'programmes', 'appear', 'have', 'been', 'transferred', 'straight', 'analogue', 'broadcast', 'tapes', 'work', 'television', 'UK', 'Tape', 'dropout', 'evident', 'episodes', 'would', 'imagine', 'source', 'be', '1', 'Betacam', 'SP', 'master', 'Remastering', 'when', 'go', 'back', 'original', '35mm', 'film', 'negatives', 'make', 'fresh', 'film', 'print', 'digital', 'tape', 'master', 'negative', 'colour', 'correct', 'scene', 'scene', 'paint', 'out', 'dirt', 'scratches', 'using', 'modern', 'computer', 'software', 'would', 'love', 'producers', 'DVDs', 'offer', 'kind', 'explanation', 'why', 'barest', 'minimum', 'effort', 'been', 'put', 'can', 'live', 'few', 'scratches', 'jumps', 'as', 'long', 'episode', 'content', 'there', 'picture', 'sharp', 'colourful', 'many', 'purchasers', 'are', 'reporting', 'episdoes', 'missing', 'scenes', 'collectors', 'boxset', 'appalling.The', 'main', 'fault', 'could', 'lie', 'Worldvision', 'distributors', 'series', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'supplied', 'duff', 'ex-broadcast', 'master', 'tapes', 'Again', ""'m"", 'sure', 'would', 'agree', 'down', 'video', 'company', 'check', 'are', 'poor', 'edited', 'send', 'back', 'demand', 'better', 'ones', 'only', 'need', 'check', 'run', 'time', 'see', 'short', 'people', 'are', 'paying', 'money', 'discs.The', 'original', 'runs', ""'Little"", 'House', 'UK', 'were', 'broadcast', 'directly', '35mm', 'film', 'prints', 'so', 'quality', 'was', 'always', 'nice', 'only', 'latter', 'part', '1980', 'when', 'distributors', 'began', 'supplying', 'film', 'series', 'videotape', 'quality', 'problems', 'started', 'especially', 'converting', 'USA', 'NTSC', 'television', 'system', 'UK', 'PAL', 'Analogue', 'NTSC', 'was', 'absolute', 'rubbish', 'accounts', 'washed', 'out', 'pictures', 'are', 'now', 'encountering', 'DVD']",Little House on the Prairie - The Complete Season 6

I still remember as a kid watching this show from week to week with new interest in seeing how Laura was going to win the heart of her future-husband, Almanzo Wilder.  Dean Butler was a great addition to the cast, and his commentary on this DVD is very good.However, the problem that I have with this DVD set, as with Season 5, is that it is NOT complete.  There are many scenes missing from a number of episodes.  Don't you find it odd that virtually every other TV show that has made it to DVD is done so unedited?!?  I've heard that NBC tried to pull the same thing with the first season of the Cosby Show until enough complaints to NBC forced them to make sure that all subsequent releases were, in fact, unedited.It's a real shame that such a classic family show as this is not being given the quality that it should be.  These ""missing"" scenes are not lost.  I've seen them in re-runs on television.This is the only reason I give three stars to this product.  It's a definite five for the show itself.  You have to wonder that if Michael Landon was alive, would he tolerate such tampering with his show?Note: It seems that most of the TV series that are released through NBC Home Entertainment are edited.  These include Little House, Cosby Show, and Highway to Heaven from what I've seen and possibly others.",3,"Once Again...Great Season But ""Incomplete"" DVD",1175212800,"03 30, 2007",2007,1412,"['Little', 'House', 'Prairie', 'may', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'peak', 'run', 'sixth', 'season', 'still', 'remember', 'kid', 'watching', 'show', 'week', 'week', 'new', 'interest', 'seeing', 'how', 'Laura', 'was', 'going', 'win', 'heart', 'future-husband', 'Almanzo', 'Wilder', 'Dean', 'Butler', 'was', 'great', 'addition', 'cast', 'commentary', 'DVD', 'very', 'good.However', 'problem', 'have', 'DVD', 'set', 'Season', '5', 'NOT', 'complete', 'are', 'many', 'scenes', 'missing', 'number', 'episodes', 'Do', ""n't"", 'find', 'odd', 'virtually', 'other', 'TV', 'show', 'made', 'DVD', 'done', 'so', 'unedited', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'NBC', 'tried', 'pull', 'same', 'thing', 'first', 'season', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'enough', 'complaints', 'NBC', 'forced', 'make', 'sure', 'subsequent', 'releases', 'were', 'fact', 'unedited.It', 'real', 'shame', 'classic', 'family', 'show', 'not', 'being', 'given', 'quality', 'should', 'be', 'missing', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'lost', ""'ve"", 'seen', 're-runs', 'television.This', 'only', 'reason', 'give', 'three', 'stars', 'product', 'definite', 'five', 'show', 'have', 'wonder', 'Michael', 'Landon', 'was', 'alive', 'would', 'tolerate', 'such', 'tampering', 'show', 'Note', 'most', 'TV', 'series', 'are', 'released', 'NBC', 'Home', 'Entertainment', 'are', 'edited', 'include', 'Little', 'House', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'Highway', 'Heaven', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'possibly', 'others']",Little House on the Prairie - The Complete Season 6

Yes the picture isn't of quality, the sound is too low at times, and the case for the DVDs doesn't hold them well at all but I settled for this because I don't see a lot of other choices out there. I might not have looked in the right places though but this is an old series so you can't expect the greatest of quality.
