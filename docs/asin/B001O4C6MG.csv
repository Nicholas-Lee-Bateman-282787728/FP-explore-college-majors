1221786,A2BPDFR58H9575,B001O4C6MG,Galina,"[2, 3]","The first episode ever of BBC Mystery! She Fell Among Thieves is an amusing and entertaining mystery/crime/period piece. It was adapted from the novel by Dornfold Yates and it tells the story where a nice proper English gentleman Richard Chandos (Malcolm McDowell in his charmingly naive Mick ""Lucky Man"" Travis mode) on vacation in the southern France finds the body of a man known as an associate of a mysterious powerful crime boss named Vanity Fair (yes, that's right). Eileen Atkins plays the murderous leader of the gang/evil step-mother who would stop to nothing to press her angelic beautiful stepdaughter to get married before she gets of age, so Vanity Fair will inherit the fortune of her late husband and will stay the mistress of a spectacular turreted Chateau Jezreel. Atkins obviously took the part with the big doze of humor and plays with such gusto that instead of being terrified of Vanity Fair, I could not help grinning every time she would enter the screen wearing makeup so heavy and screaming that she reminded me of Donald Sutherland as Casanova in the Fellini's film or Bette Davis in the Death on the Nile, one of Agatha Christie's adaptations which She Fell Among Thieves reminds with the beautiful scenery, gorgeous costumes, attentions to all period details, and ironically with the final scene. I think the makeup that Atkins had to apply and her exaggerated gesticulations, piercing glares, hissing and barking the orders to her not always efficient henchmen go well together and give the viewers a good idea that this picture is not about subtlety or twists and turns of the plot but about good old campy fun. The plot is predictable, and what would you expect with the wicked step-mother, innocent blonde step-daughter waiting to be saved by a knight in shining armor who would appear just in time to free the maiden, and all types of rather pathetic criminals as well as the brave Foreign Office men on hand to save the day and stop Vanity Fair before she strikes again. Somehow, however, predictability makes this little film very enjoyable. Add truly beautiful scenery, romantic castles, three (3) Rolls-Royces, and rest assured that the baddies will get their just deserts and the good time will be had by everyone.",3,The stuff the cult movies are made of,1251158400,"08 25, 2009",2009,2253,"['first', 'episode', 'ever', 'BBC', 'Mystery', 'Fell', 'Thieves', 'amusing', 'entertaining', 'mystery/crime/period', 'piece', 'was', 'adapted', 'novel', 'Dornfold', 'Yates', 'story', 'where', 'nice', 'proper', 'English', 'gentleman', 'Richard', 'Chandos', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'charmingly', 'naive', 'Mick', 'Lucky', 'Man', 'Travis', 'mode', 'vacation', 'southern', 'France', 'body', 'man', 'known', 'associate', 'mysterious', 'powerful', 'crime', 'boss', 'named', 'Vanity', 'Fair', 'yes', 'right', 'Eileen', 'Atkins', 'murderous', 'leader', 'gang/evil', 'step-mother', 'who', 'would', 'stop', 'nothing', 'press', 'angelic', 'beautiful', 'stepdaughter', 'get', 'married', 'age', 'Vanity', 'Fair', 'will', 'inherit', 'fortune', 'late', 'husband', 'will', 'stay', 'mistress', 'spectacular', 'turreted', 'Chateau', 'Jezreel', 'Atkins', 'obviously', 'took', 'part', 'big', 'doze', 'humor', 'plays', 'such', 'gusto', 'instead', 'being', 'terrified', 'Vanity', 'Fair', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'grinning', 'time', 'would', 'enter', 'screen', 'wearing', 'makeup', 'so', 'heavy', 'screaming', 'reminded', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Casanova', 'Fellini', 'film', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'Death', 'Nile', 'one', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'adaptations', 'Fell', 'Thieves', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'gorgeous', 'costumes', 'attentions', 'period', 'details', 'ironically', 'final', 'scene', 'think', 'makeup', 'had', 'apply', 'exaggerated', 'gesticulations', 'piercing', 'glares', 'hissing', 'barking', 'orders', 'not', 'always', 'efficient', 'henchmen', 'go', 'well', 'together', 'give', 'viewers', 'good', 'idea', 'picture', 'not', 'subtlety', 'twists', 'turns', 'plot', 'about', 'good', 'old', 'campy', 'fun', 'plot', 'predictable', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'wicked', 'step-mother', 'innocent', 'blonde', 'step-daughter', 'waiting', 'be', 'saved', 'knight', 'shining', 'armor', 'who', 'would', 'appear', 'just', 'time', 'free', 'maiden', 'types', 'rather', 'pathetic', 'criminals', 'as', 'well', 'brave', 'Foreign', 'Office', 'men', 'hand', 'save', 'day', 'stop', 'Vanity', 'Fair', 'again', 'Somehow', 'however', 'predictability', 'little', 'film', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'Add', 'truly', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'romantic', 'castles', 'three', '3', 'Rolls-Royces', 'rest', 'assured', 'baddies', 'will', 'get', 'just', 'deserts', 'good', 'time', 'will', 'be', 'had', 'everyone']",She Fell Among Thieves

I especially like the character actors in the British films and the way the stories develop, which is different than American mysteries. However, after about fifteen minutes, I began to feel that there was something strange about this film and considered turning it off.The story is about a woman, Vanity Fair, who heads a small band of thieves and who controls them with her strong personality. She has a step daughter, who seems to be quite nave and who is not a thief. The step daughter will inherit millions of dollars if she will marry, and the step mother, Vanity, can then take her money from her. This plot sounds good, but it is presented in a very campy manner. Camp is fun, but somehow I felt that while it was ok to watch it, it was not as funny as camp should be, the development of the plot was generally unreasonable and sometimes bordered on the ridiculous, and the company of thieves, all of whom were camp characters, including Vanity, were somewhat silly.",3,Good story but the camp method of presenting it isn't as funny as it should be,1359244800,"01 27, 2013",2013,1116,"['looked', 'forward', 'viewing', 'film', 'was', 'part', 'BBC', 'PBS', 'series', 'PBS', 'usually', 'not', 'always', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'films', 'especially', 'character', 'actors', 'British', 'films', 'way', 'stories', 'develop', 'different', 'American', 'mysteries', 'However', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'began', 'feel', 'was', 'something', 'strange', 'film', 'considered', 'turning', 'off.The', 'story', 'woman', 'Vanity', 'Fair', 'who', 'small', 'band', 'thieves', 'who', 'strong', 'personality', 'step', 'daughter', 'who', 'be', 'quite', 'nave', 'who', 'not', 'thief', 'step', 'daughter', 'will', 'inherit', 'millions', 'dollars', 'will', 'marry', 'step', 'mother', 'Vanity', 'can', 'then', 'take', 'money', 'plot', 'good', 'presented', 'very', 'campy', 'manner', 'Camp', 'fun', 'somehow', 'felt', 'was', 'ok', 'watch', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'funny', 'camp', 'should', 'be', 'development', 'plot', 'was', 'generally', 'unreasonable', 'sometimes', 'bordered', 'ridiculous', 'company', 'thieves', 'whom', 'were', 'camp', 'characters', 'including', 'Vanity', 'were', 'somewhat', 'silly']",She Fell Among Thieves

The production was meant to be over the top and a bit farcical, and it certainly succeeded.  I remember laughing hysterically part of the time and using all my wits to comprehend the latest plot twist at others.After thirty years She Fell Among Thieves is once again available.
