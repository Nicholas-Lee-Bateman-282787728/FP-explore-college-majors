If you're looking for something funny to laugh at, then I highly recommend this movie because it shouldn't be taken too seriously. My friends and I had just finished watching alot of serious, sad movies over the weekend so at the moment we needed a good laugh and something to lift us up. Curiosity enticed us to watch this movie and we were laughing to tears. The story involves a battle to the death of two ninja kings. There can only be one. One ninja who is defeated and left for dead is taken in by a jolly yakuza family. They nurse him back to health and too our surprise a change happens. I encourage everyone to watch this movie. At the very least you will smile.",4,Good movie when you need to laugh!,1399766400,"05 11, 2014",2014,771,"['Ok', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'normal', 'average', 'film', 'format', 'warn', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'here', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'funny', 'laugh', 'then', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'taken', 'too', 'seriously', 'My', 'friends', 'had', 'just', 'finished', 'watching', 'alot', 'serious', 'sad', 'movies', 'weekend', 'so', 'moment', 'needed', 'good', 'laugh', 'something', 'lift', 'up', 'Curiosity', 'enticed', 'watch', 'movie', 'were', 'laughing', 'tears', 'story', 'battle', 'death', 'two', 'ninja', 'kings', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'one', 'One', 'ninja', 'who', 'defeated', 'left', 'dead', 'taken', 'jolly', 'yakuza', 'family', 'nurse', 'back', 'health', 'too', 'surprise', 'change', 'encourage', 'everyone', 'watch', 'movie', 'very', 'least', 'will', 'smile']",Yakuza Vs.

After a few short minutes I realized that this movie was the beginning of a new genre.  It's live-action anime.  If you imagine the characters with impossibly large eyes then you'll see what I mean.  This movie has all the makings of an animated feature: the ninja, the sumo wrestler, the girl with an impossibly high voice, the guy with long hair and a bad attitude.  This is a manga brought to life.In all seriousness, I sat through this for 20 minutes and except for the anime reference I saw nothing that conveyed entertainment to me.  We have a sarcastic 12-year-old boy in the house who I might show it to just for the purposes of making fun of it but aside from that it's complete garbage.  The fight scenes are an insult to human intelligence and the plot, whatever it might happen to be, is beyond comprehension.  Take the advice of all the 1-star reviewers and move on to the video of the fireplace or something.  That, at least, would make some sense.",2,"Solid 2-star movie, not sure what those other reviewers were going on about...",1389830400,"01 16, 2014",2014,1388,"['So', 'picked', 'movie', 'looked', 'sad', 'lonely', 'Amazon', 'Instant', 'Watch', 'well', 'am', 'pumped', 'did', 'because', 'first', 'experience', 'live-action', 'anime.Previous', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'movie', 'terrible', 'sure', 'sort', 'vague', 'standard', '34', 'good', '34', 'vs', '34', 'bad', '34', 'movie', 'not', 'exactly', 'realm', 'watchable', 'have', 'give', 'credit', 'very', 'first', 'kind', 'few', 'short', 'minutes', 'realized', 'movie', 'was', 'beginning', 'new', 'genre', 'live-action', 'anime', 'imagine', 'characters', 'impossibly', 'large', 'eyes', 'then', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'movie', 'makings', 'animated', 'feature', 'ninja', 'sumo', 'wrestler', 'girl', 'impossibly', 'high', 'voice', 'guy', 'long', 'hair', 'bad', 'attitude', 'manga', 'brought', 'life.In', 'seriousness', 'sat', '20', 'minutes', 'anime', 'reference', 'saw', 'nothing', 'conveyed', 'entertainment', 'have', 'sarcastic', '12-year-old', 'boy', 'house', 'who', 'might', 'show', 'just', 'purposes', 'making', 'fun', 'aside', 'complete', 'garbage', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'insult', 'human', 'intelligence', 'plot', 'might', 'happen', 'be', 'comprehension', 'Take', 'advice', '1-star', 'reviewers', 'move', 'video', 'fireplace', 'something', 'least', 'would', 'make', 'sense']",Yakuza Vs.
