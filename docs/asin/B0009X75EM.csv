And don't be deceived by the first half of ""The man who copied"", which seems to promise light entertainment. Despite the lightness of the first half, and the apparent ""innocence"" and naivete of some of the characters, much darkness awaits ahead. Indeed the script will present you with some interesting and non-obvious moral interrogatives.I watched this movie after enjoying ""Romeo and Juliet get married"", another Brazilian movie where the stunning Luana Piovani (who in this movie plays the interesting role of the not-so-dumb blonde) is the main female character. If you are looking for light entertainment in a foreign comedy, you may be better off watching Romeo and Juliet (unless you really dislike soccer). But if you are looking for something deeper, or for something maybe in between a romantic comedy and ""City of God"", then look no further than this one!",4,An interesting and strange movie (mild spoilers inside),1233792000,"02 5, 2009",2009,984,"['liked', 'film', 'are', 'looking', 'light', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'may', 'be', 'better', 'off', 'looking', 'somewhere', 'else', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'deceived', 'first', 'half', 'man', 'who', 'copied', 'promise', 'light', 'entertainment', 'lightness', 'first', 'half', 'apparent', 'innocence', 'naivete', 'characters', 'much', 'darkness', 'awaits', 'ahead', 'Indeed', 'script', 'will', 'present', 'interesting', 'non-obvious', 'moral', 'interrogatives.I', 'watched', 'movie', 'enjoying', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'get', 'married', 'Brazilian', 'movie', 'where', 'stunning', 'Luana', 'Piovani', 'who', 'movie', 'interesting', 'role', 'not-so-dumb', 'blonde', 'main', 'female', 'character', 'are', 'looking', 'light', 'entertainment', 'foreign', 'comedy', 'may', 'be', 'better', 'off', 'watching', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'really', 'dislike', 'soccer', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'deeper', 'something', 'maybe', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'City', 'God', 'then', 'look', 'further', 'one']",Latter Days
915275,A1XI5UAJE5Z6KN,B0009X75EM,bordersj2,"[4, 5]","Lazaro Ramos is one of my favorite actors.  He's been in a lot of movies and tv shows in Brasil too - the most recent one I can think of was the soap opera ""Cobras & Lagartos"" where he was at the center of the novelas plot.  Meanwhile Pedro Cardoso is an actor that almost triggers a ""laugh on site' order - especially with his outfits!  He too has been in several movies but prominantly features in the sitcome ""O Grande Familia"".  But here they are both featured and neither one of them disappoint, along with a pretty strong cast of characters like the adorable Leandra Leal and the drop-dead smokin' gorgeous Luana Piovani.To describe the movie without giving it all away... it's about a young man (Lazaro Ramos) with a bit of a bleak reality and future who's job is to work on a copy machine.  All the while, he is infatuated with a girl (Leandra Leal) that lives a few buildings down from him whom he 'spies' on whenever he gets the chance.  Characters are gradually introduced in the series, like Cardoso, who was Luana's boyfriend in the movie, but the movie bursts into a full sprint the very moment Lazaro's boss buys a color printer and the element of half-hazard crime kicks in.  The funniest thing is that everything stems from a sort of innocent crush that he has on the girl in the other building and how he just wants to meet her.I really enjoyed the movie.  It wasn't incredibly deep, and it wasn't overly thought-provoking - it was just a good sort of romantic/comedy/drama (sorry).  I liked that it wasn't completely depressing or harsh... you see enough of that reality with Brasil should you live there.  But you do see some funny/sad scenes, like the way the movie opens up.  Lazaro narrates his routine, and he is at the store deciding what he can buy, and the attitudes of the shop-keepers and cashier.  Brasil!  The movie does build a bit slowly, admittedly, but it whisks you away at one point with the changes in events that occur.Leanda Leal was adorable in the movie and her personality was great throughout, even surprising a bit towards the end.  And Cardoso was... Cardoso, while Lazaro Ramos, of course, has a charm to him that makes viewers root for him.  It's a good, fun movie which you want to see a second time after seeing it through since almost EVERYTHING in it has a meaning.  Sort of like ""Next Stop Wonderland"".",5,Good Movie,1186012800,"08 2, 2007",2007,2355,"['Lazaro', 'Ramos', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'been', 'lot', 'movies', 'tv', 'shows', 'Brasil', 'too', 'most', 'recent', 'one', 'can', 'think', 'was', 'soap', 'opera', 'Cobras', 'Lagartos', 'where', 'was', 'center', 'novelas', 'plot', 'Meanwhile', 'Pedro', 'Cardoso', 'actor', 'almost', 'laugh', 'site', 'order', 'especially', 'outfits', 'too', 'been', 'several', 'movies', 'prominantly', 'features', 'sitcome', 'O', 'Grande', 'Familia', 'here', 'are', 'featured', 'one', 'disappoint', 'pretty', 'strong', 'cast', 'characters', 'adorable', 'Leandra', 'Leal', 'drop-dead', 'smokin', 'gorgeous', 'Luana', 'Piovani.To', 'movie', 'giving', 'away', 'young', 'man', 'Lazaro', 'Ramos', 'bit', 'bleak', 'reality', 'future', 'who', 'job', 'work', 'copy', 'machine', 'while', 'infatuated', 'girl', 'Leandra', 'Leal', 'few', 'buildings', 'down', 'whom', 'chance', 'Characters', 'are', 'gradually', 'introduced', 'series', 'Cardoso', 'who', 'was', 'Luana', 'boyfriend', 'movie', 'movie', 'full', 'sprint', 'very', 'moment', 'Lazaro', 'boss', 'color', 'printer', 'element', 'half-hazard', 'crime', 'kicks', 'funniest', 'thing', 'everything', 'sort', 'innocent', 'crush', 'girl', 'other', 'building', 'how', 'just', 'meet', 'her.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'incredibly', 'deep', 'was', ""n't"", 'overly', 'thought-provoking', 'was', 'just', 'good', 'sort', 'romantic/comedy/drama', 'sorry', 'liked', 'was', ""n't"", 'completely', 'depressing', 'harsh', 'see', 'enough', 'reality', 'Brasil', 'should', 'live', 'there', 'do', 'see', 'funny/sad', 'scenes', 'way', 'movie', 'up', 'Lazaro', 'routine', 'store', 'deciding', 'what', 'can', 'buy', 'attitudes', 'shop-keepers', 'cashier', 'Brasil', 'movie', 'build', 'bit', 'slowly', 'admittedly', 'away', 'one', 'point', 'changes', 'events', 'occur.Leanda', 'Leal', 'was', 'adorable', 'movie', 'personality', 'was', 'great', 'even', 'surprising', 'bit', 'end', 'Cardoso', 'was', 'Cardoso', 'Lazaro', 'Ramos', 'course', 'charm', 'viewers', 'root', 'good', 'fun', 'movie', 'want', 'see', 'second', 'time', 'seeing', 'almost', 'EVERYTHING', 'meaning', 'Sort', 'Next', 'Stop', 'Wonderland']",Latter Days

Our ""man who copies"", Andr&eacute;, is portrayed by gifted Brazilian actor L&aacute;zaro Ramos.  I first became a fan of Ramos in his portrayal of the petty thug and drug-addled prisoner Ezequiel in Carandiru.  Ramos totally loses himself as the passive copy shop worker, to the point where I didn't even realize it was the same actor as Carandiru until halfway through the film (he goes blond in the prison film).Luana Piovani is painfully sexy as Marins, and does a solid acting job as Andr&eacute;'s seductive co-worker.  Leandra Leal and Pedro Cardoso also make for a great supporting cast, both having earned their stripes in Brazilian TV and cinema.One of my favorite aspects of the film is the inclusion of animation, which does a great and funny job of telling Andr&eacute;'s story.
