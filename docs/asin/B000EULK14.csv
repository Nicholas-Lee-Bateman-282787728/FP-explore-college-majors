Basilio works long shifts for $2.50 a day. But then transfers to a more dangerous mine where he is able to make $4.00 a day. Somehow he manages to also attend to school, though he has to spend a substantial amount of his salary just to pay for his school uniform.One of the great things about this doc is that the film makers have a sincere humanitarian purpose. They not only want to educate viewers about the horrors of child labor. But actually do something tangiable to better the lives of these kids.Included in the bonus features is a short film which shows how Basilio and Bernardino are doing one year after filming. Apparently an aide agency called Kindernothilfe has enabled the boys to leave the mines, move their family into a apartment in Potosi and continue their educations so they will have better opportunities in life.I wish these great youngsters, and others like them, all the best.

979110,A3Q04XXGGED746,B000EULK14,"Jan Peczkis ""Scholar and Thinker""","[6, 6]","This movie is eye-opening. It shows how life in poor countries is very different in so many ways from that in the affluent USA.What's it like to work in silver mines when you are still a child? This Spanish-language movie, with English subtitles, tells it all. The father had died years ago, and the mother must take care of younger children. So, as is true in other situations where the oldest child must grow up fast and assume many of the responsibilities of the missing parent, the 14 year-old boy must work to support the family. So does his 12 year-old brother. When the 14 year-old moves on to the larger, more profitable mine (in the ""mountain that eats people""), the only consolation is the fact that the foreman pledges to the mother that he will watch out for the boy. Mining is arduous and dangerous. The miners of all ages must chew on coca leaves (the precursor to cocaine) in order to combat fatigue.Most cases of child labor involve situations where generations of people are trapped in poverty. This situation is potentially different. The larger mine has pneumatic drills, suggesting that technological improvements in Bolivian mining will eventually make child labor unprofitable and therefore obsolete. The 12 and 14 year-old boys go to school in hopes that they can get safer and better-paying jobs when they are older. They wear uniforms that their mother can barely afford. As a professional educator, I am struck by the respect for education and its contrast with the often superficial attitudes of American parents and children towards the schooling process.Both children and adults in this area believe that, whereas God rules the world above ground, the Tio (Satan) rules the underworld. In order to avoid tragedies and to be granted access to good veins of silver, the miners must pay homage to the devil by praying to him, lighting candles to him, and offering him gifts of tobacco, alcohol, etc.  The boys explain the origins of this devil-worship: When Spanish colonists forced Indians to work in the mines, the latter sometimes rebelled. So, to instill fear, the colonists told the Indians that if they balked at working, the devil would punish them. A local priest explains how he tries to combat this old superstition.",5,Living in Poverty with a Hope for the Future,1212019200,"05 29, 2008",2008,2252,"['movie', 'eye-opening', 'how', 'life', 'poor', 'countries', 'very', 'different', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'affluent', 'USA.What', 'work', 'silver', 'mines', 'when', 'are', 'still', 'child', 'Spanish-language', 'movie', 'English', 'subtitles', 'tells', 'father', 'had', 'died', 'years', 'ago', 'mother', 'must', 'take', 'care', 'younger', 'children', 'So', 'true', 'other', 'situations', 'where', 'oldest', 'child', 'must', 'grow', 'up', 'fast', 'assume', 'many', 'responsibilities', 'missing', 'parent', '14', 'year-old', 'boy', 'must', 'work', 'support', 'family', 'So', '12', 'year-old', 'brother', 'When', '14', 'year-old', 'moves', 'larger', 'more', 'profitable', 'mine', 'mountain', 'people', 'only', 'consolation', 'fact', 'foreman', 'mother', 'will', 'watch', 'out', 'boy', 'Mining', 'arduous', 'dangerous', 'miners', 'ages', 'must', 'chew', 'coca', 'leaves', 'precursor', 'cocaine', 'order', 'combat', 'fatigue.Most', 'cases', 'child', 'labor', 'involve', 'situations', 'where', 'generations', 'people', 'are', 'trapped', 'poverty', 'situation', 'potentially', 'different', 'larger', 'mine', 'pneumatic', 'drills', 'suggesting', 'technological', 'improvements', 'Bolivian', 'mining', 'will', 'eventually', 'make', 'child', 'labor', 'unprofitable', 'therefore', 'obsolete', '12', '14', 'year-old', 'boys', 'go', 'school', 'hopes', 'can', 'get', 'safer', 'better-paying', 'jobs', 'when', 'are', 'older', 'wear', 'uniforms', 'mother', 'can', 'barely', 'afford', 'professional', 'educator', 'am', 'struck', 'respect', 'education', 'contrast', 'often', 'superficial', 'attitudes', 'American', 'parents', 'children', 'schooling', 'process.Both', 'children', 'adults', 'area', 'believe', 'God', 'rules', 'world', 'ground', 'Tio', 'Satan', 'rules', 'underworld', 'order', 'avoid', 'tragedies', 'be', 'granted', 'access', 'good', 'veins', 'silver', 'miners', 'must', 'pay', 'homage', 'devil', 'praying', 'lighting', 'candles', 'offering', 'gifts', 'tobacco', 'alcohol', 'etc', 'boys', 'explain', 'origins', 'devil-worship', 'When', 'Spanish', 'colonists', 'forced', 'Indians', 'work', 'mines', 'latter', 'sometimes', 'rebelled', 'So', 'instill', 'fear', 'colonists', 'told', 'Indians', 'balked', 'working', 'devil', 'would', 'punish', 'local', 'priest', 'how', 'combat', 'old', 'superstition']",The Devil's Miner
979111,A140XH16IKR4B0,B000EULK14,Jean E. Pouliot,"[0, 0]","What is it like to live without a safety net? Kief Davidson's ""The Devil's Miner"" gives us a close-up  of what that means for two young Bolivian boys who live with their mother and sister on the edge of a silver mine. Basilio and Bernardino are 14 and 12 years old. Their father is dead, and they are forced to support the family by toiling in the tapped-out mine. The work--descending into jerry-rigged tunnels to drill and shovel ore back to the surface--is terrifying, dangerous and unhealthy. Rockslides and gas explosions are real possibilities. To allay their fears, the miners give homage to Tio, a demon-figure of the underworld. To properly appease Tio means to avoid being blown up or buried alive. All for the chance to work another day in an occupation that will kill the miners sooner (with explosions or slides) or later (with silicosis).The film follows Basilio into the mine, and also into his school, where he hopes to gains the education to escape the lung-searing, life-shortening trauma of silicosis. The family is also shown attending a miners' festival, one of the few opportunities to let loose and enjoy life, such as it is. The film's interviews with Basilio show a boy far more mature than this age would suggest. He clearly bears the burden of supporting his mother and sister, of showing his little brother the ropes and of trying to escape his  fate. His cautious optimism is moving. The film ends without a resolution of his situation. No feel-good over-titles tell whether he attained his dreams of becoming a doctor, farmer or engineer.The film's honesty is breathtaking. The local priest is completely aware that the miners, who worship Christ above ground, also worship the devil below. The priest, a young and sensitive man, understands the unquenchable fear that grips these men. Rather than condemning their idolatry, he hopes to convince them eventually that God's love is stronger than Tio's protection. But it's a hard message to sell to these uneducated, hard-boiled and realistic men.""The Devil's Miner"" brings the desperation of the world's poor directly into the light. Their nobility and even humor in the face of back-breaking, life-truncating labor is as impressive as it is disheartening. By focusing so tightly on one small family, the film humanizes the anguishing, dispiriting life that is the lot of so many.",5,Delving deeply into the lives of the desperately poor,1334880000,"04 20, 2012",2012,2360,"['What', 'live', 'safety', 'net', 'Kief', 'Davidson', 'Devil', 'Miner', 'close-up', 'what', 'two', 'young', 'Bolivian', 'boys', 'who', 'live', 'mother', 'sister', 'edge', 'silver', 'mine', 'Basilio', 'Bernardino', 'are', '14', '12', 'years', 'old', 'father', 'dead', 'are', 'forced', 'support', 'family', 'toiling', 'tapped-out', 'mine', 'work', 'descending', 'jerry-rigged', 'tunnels', 'drill', 'shovel', 'ore', 'back', 'surface', 'terrifying', 'dangerous', 'unhealthy', 'Rockslides', 'gas', 'explosions', 'are', 'real', 'possibilities', 'allay', 'fears', 'miners', 'give', 'homage', 'Tio', 'demon-figure', 'underworld', 'properly', 'appease', 'Tio', 'avoid', 'being', 'blown', 'up', 'buried', 'alive', 'chance', 'work', 'day', 'occupation', 'will', 'kill', 'miners', 'sooner', 'explosions', 'slides', 'later', 'silicosis', '.The', 'film', 'Basilio', 'mine', 'also', 'school', 'where', 'gains', 'education', 'escape', 'lung-searing', 'life-shortening', 'trauma', 'silicosis', 'family', 'also', 'shown', 'attending', 'miners', 'festival', 'one', 'few', 'opportunities', 'let', 'loose', 'enjoy', 'life', 'such', 'film', 'interviews', 'Basilio', 'show', 'boy', 'far', 'more', 'mature', 'age', 'would', 'suggest', 'clearly', 'burden', 'supporting', 'mother', 'sister', 'showing', 'little', 'brother', 'ropes', 'trying', 'escape', 'fate', 'cautious', 'optimism', 'moving', 'film', 'resolution', 'situation', 'feel-good', 'over-titles', 'tell', 'attained', 'dreams', 'becoming', 'doctor', 'farmer', 'engineer.The', 'film', 'honesty', 'breathtaking', 'local', 'priest', 'completely', 'aware', 'miners', 'who', 'worship', 'Christ', 'ground', 'also', 'worship', 'devil', 'priest', 'young', 'sensitive', 'man', 'unquenchable', 'fear', 'men', 'Rather', 'condemning', 'idolatry', 'convince', 'eventually', 'God', 'love', 'stronger', 'Tio', 'protection', 'hard', 'message', 'sell', 'uneducated', 'hard-boiled', 'realistic', 'men', 'Devil', 'Miner', 'desperation', 'world', 'poor', 'directly', 'light', 'nobility', 'even', 'humor', 'face', 'back-breaking', 'life-truncating', 'labor', 'as', 'impressive', 'disheartening', 'focusing', 'so', 'tightly', 'one', 'small', 'family', 'film', 'anguishing', 'dispiriting', 'life', 'lot', 'so', 'many']",The Devil's Miner
979112,A3MLO4GAD2O9DL,B000EULK14,"LGwriter ""SharpWitGuy""","[5, 5]","Two Americans, Kief Davidson and Richard Ladkani, went to Bolivia to film this documentary. I saw this film at its New York City premiere a few years ago, in a theater in Greenwich Village, and Mr. Davidson was in the audience. He answered a number of questions after the film was over. While some efforts are being made to address the horrific situation of pre-teenagers working under dangerous health conditions in the Bolivian silver mines, nowhere near enough funding is available to prevent this enormously saddening practice from continuing.The sight of miners--boys and men alike--walking maskless in and through clouds of mineral dust is truly horrifying. Then when you realize that some of these boys are as young as 12 years old, it's even worse. This scenario, when juxtaposed with miners praying to various statues of the devil--most festooned with flowers, food, and other items of thanks--is almost too bizarre to be believed, especially given the devout Catholicism of the population. But in the mines of Bolivia, the devil is, for better or worse, the chief deity--it is he who holds sway over the daily lives of the miners who, if they live past the age of 40, are considered lucky indeed.The main character in the film is a 14-year old boy who with his 12-year old brother works in these mines to put food on the table for his broken family (the father is not in the household). He goes to school with his brother and hopes for a better future, but it's relatively clear, seeing the film, that this is really a dim kind of hope.The Devil's Miner brings to light one of the most tragic plights of people living in poverty in various parts of the world. It's interesting to compare this with a feature film, Blind Shaft, set in China, about two miners who perpetrate a murderous scam to make money additional to their work.This is a superior film, very highly recommended.",5,Superior documentary about poverty and shreds of hope,1183420800,"07 3, 2007",2007,1888,"['Two', 'Americans', 'Kief', 'Davidson', 'Richard', 'Ladkani', 'went', 'Bolivia', 'film', 'documentary', 'saw', 'film', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'premiere', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'theater', 'Greenwich', 'Village', 'Mr.', 'Davidson', 'was', 'audience', 'answered', 'number', 'questions', 'film', 'was', 'over', 'efforts', 'are', 'being', 'made', 'address', 'horrific', 'situation', 'pre-teenagers', 'working', 'dangerous', 'health', 'conditions', 'Bolivian', 'silver', 'mines', 'nowhere', 'enough', 'funding', 'available', 'prevent', 'enormously', 'saddening', 'practice', 'continuing.The', 'sight', 'miners', 'boys', 'men', 'alike', 'walking', 'maskless', 'clouds', 'mineral', 'dust', 'truly', 'horrifying', 'Then', 'when', 'realize', 'boys', 'are', 'as', 'young', '12', 'years', 'old', 'even', 'worse', 'scenario', 'when', 'juxtaposed', 'miners', 'praying', 'various', 'statues', 'devil', 'most', 'festooned', 'flowers', 'food', 'other', 'items', 'thanks', 'almost', 'too', 'bizarre', 'be', 'believed', 'especially', 'given', 'devout', 'Catholicism', 'population', 'mines', 'Bolivia', 'devil', 'better', 'worse', 'chief', 'deity', 'who', 'sway', 'daily', 'lives', 'miners', 'who', 'live', 'age', '40', 'are', 'considered', 'lucky', 'indeed.The', 'main', 'character', 'film', '14-year', 'old', 'boy', 'who', '12-year', 'old', 'brother', 'mines', 'put', 'food', 'table', 'broken', 'family', 'father', 'not', 'household', 'school', 'brother', 'better', 'future', 'relatively', 'clear', 'seeing', 'film', 'really', 'dim', 'kind', 'hope.The', 'Devil', 'Miner', 'light', 'one', 'most', 'tragic', 'plights', 'people', 'living', 'poverty', 'various', 'parts', 'world', 'interesting', 'compare', 'feature', 'film', 'Blind', 'Shaft', 'set', 'China', 'about', 'two', 'miners', 'who', 'perpetrate', 'murderous', 'scam', 'make', 'money', 'additional', 'work.This', 'superior', 'film', 'very', 'highly', 'recommended']",The Devil's Miner

If your children do not appreciate the lifestyle they enjoy, (and whose do?)

Quite simply, it's always the children that suffer.Imagine a 14 year-old that genuinely wants to go to school, despite the ridicule by other students who don't have the burden of also being the head of a household.  What adds to the frustration of watching the film is how scant the wages of Bolivia compare to those of even modestly industrialized nations.All nations will undoubtedly struggle through the same process of modernization that Americans did some 150 plus years ago and Bolivia endures today.  It is odd to see that the same child labor and working conditions that we outlawed so long ago are still alive and well in places like Bolivia.

Immersing yourself in this film will also help you to realize that even the poorest burger flipping minimum wage worker here in America lives like a pampered king compared to these individuals.There is also the spiritual side of the film which I found fascinating.

In Bolivia, overlooking the highest city in the world, Potosi, is the mountain Cerro Rico, nicknamed ""the mountain that eats men alive"".Ancient, rotted timber sets.  Children hand-drilling with steel and a hammer. Squeezing through crude passages to get to the next level. Lighting fuses by hand and running for the one and only exit. Worn-out, barely functional machinery. Dry pneumatic drills creating clouds of pulverized rock to cut your lungs to pieces, clog them, and kill you. No communication equipment, no meaningful safety equipment or procedures, no regulation, no inspections, nothing. Leave a daily offering at the devil's altar (there's one in each of the hundreds of mines in the mountain), go 4000 feet in and 1600 feet down, and hope you get out alive at the end of your 10 to 24 hour shift. Death by age 35-40.From a historical perspective, the mines in Potosi highlight the brutality of Spain's legacy in the New World.  Much of Renaissance Europe's silver came from this one mountain. Those beautiful altar pieces in cathedrals and the ornate silver collections of kings and merchants are dripping with blood. It is fascinating that such beauty comes from such sadness.Geologists think there's still a lot of wealth in the mountain. That, plus desperation, means people will continue to try to find the silver and other metals hidden in Potosi. It's a pity the various mine co-ops don't join together and look at the feasibility of getting the financing to just start at the top and slowly level the mountain. Some people don't like ""mountain-top mining"", but it sure would beat the horrible world of Potosi's deep mines.Great documentary. I just wish they had included more mine footage, maybe as an extra on the DVD.",5,Today is worse than the bad old days,1210723200,"05 14, 2008",2008,1980,"['Enter', 'mountain', 'turned', 'Swiss', 'cheese', 'four', 'centuries', 'hodge-podge', 'mining', 'where', 'today', 'still', 'are', 'thousands', 'men', 'boys', 'intelligent', 'humane', 'dignified', 'people', 'slowly', 'destroying', 'order', 'buy', 'food', 'shelter', 'Bolivia', 'overlooking', 'highest', 'city', 'world', 'Potosi', 'mountain', 'Cerro', 'Rico', 'nicknamed', 'mountain', 'men', 'alive', '.Ancient', 'rotted', 'timber', 'sets', 'Children', 'hand-drilling', 'steel', 'hammer', 'Squeezing', 'crude', 'passages', 'get', 'next', 'level', 'Lighting', 'fuses', 'hand', 'running', 'one', 'only', 'exit', 'Worn-out', 'barely', 'functional', 'machinery', 'Dry', 'pneumatic', 'drills', 'creating', 'clouds', 'pulverized', 'rock', 'cut', 'lungs', 'pieces', 'clog', 'kill', 'communication', 'equipment', 'meaningful', 'safety', 'equipment', 'procedures', 'regulation', 'inspections', 'nothing', 'Leave', 'daily', 'offering', 'devil', 'altar', 'one', 'hundreds', 'mines', 'mountain', 'go', '4000', 'feet', '1600', 'feet', 'down', 'hope', 'get', 'out', 'alive', 'end', '10', '24', 'hour', 'shift', 'Death', 'age', '35-40.From', 'historical', 'perspective', 'mines', 'Potosi', 'highlight', 'brutality', 'Spain', 'legacy', 'New', 'World', 'Much', 'Renaissance', 'Europe', 'silver', 'came', 'one', 'mountain', 'beautiful', 'altar', 'pieces', 'cathedrals', 'ornate', 'silver', 'collections', 'kings', 'merchants', 'are', 'dripping', 'blood', 'fascinating', 'such', 'beauty', 'such', 'sadness.Geologists', 'think', 'still', 'lot', 'wealth', 'mountain', 'desperation', 'people', 'will', 'continue', 'try', 'find', 'silver', 'other', 'metals', 'hidden', 'Potosi', 'pity', 'various', 'mine', 'co-ops', 'do', ""n't"", 'join', 'together', 'look', 'feasibility', 'getting', 'financing', 'just', 'start', 'top', 'slowly', 'level', 'mountain', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'mountain-top', 'mining', 'sure', 'would', 'beat', 'horrible', 'world', 'Potosi', 'deep', 'mines.Great', 'documentary', 'just', 'wish', 'had', 'included', 'more', 'mine', 'footage', 'maybe', 'extra', 'DVD']",The Devil's Miner

I don't know how to approach the sum of the things I could say but that this is a tragedy.  The documentary follows a 14 year old Bolivian boy, Basillo, who introduces us to his world at the time.  Essentially he is a miner in a silver mine who works to help his family just scrape by.  Already you can say, 14 year old, worker, miner, supporter, what the.... !!  Let us observe this even further.  He then goes on about the fact that they pay homage or worship to the Devil to not cause them harm while in the mine.  to top it off, it turns out the kid is a bit of a Misfit in his school because he is poor and his little brother is being introduced to work in the mine as well.  Seem like a bit much..., well trust me, you have to actually see the film to see not only how atrocious and unsafe the mines are for a child but to see how desperate his situation is.  However all is not drudge and misery, at the same time we are prevued to a glimpse of a part of the world both beautiful and foreign and the mind of an innocent who only sees hope regardless of how unbelievably struggling life can be.",5,Important to watch films like this!!!!!,1358121600,"01 14, 2013",2013,1248,"[""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'documentaries', 'show', 'something', 'so', 'completely', 'different', 'i', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'imagined', 'existed', 'let', 'alone', 'world', 'toady', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'approach', 'sum', 'things', 'could', 'say', 'tragedy', 'documentary', '14', 'year', 'old', 'Bolivian', 'boy', 'Basillo', 'who', 'world', 'time', 'Essentially', 'miner', 'silver', 'mine', 'who', 'help', 'family', 'just', 'scrape', 'can', 'say', '14', 'year', 'old', 'worker', 'miner', 'supporter', 'what', 'Let', 'observe', 'even', 'further', 'then', 'fact', 'pay', 'homage', 'worship', 'Devil', 'not', 'cause', 'mine', 'top', 'off', 'out', 'kid', 'bit', 'Misfit', 'school', 'poor', 'little', 'brother', 'being', 'introduced', 'work', 'mine', 'as', 'well', 'Seem', 'bit', 'much', 'well', 'have', 'actually', 'see', 'film', 'see', 'not', 'only', 'how', 'atrocious', 'unsafe', 'mines', 'are', 'child', 'see', 'how', 'desperate', 'situation', 'However', 'not', 'drudge', 'misery', 'same', 'time', 'are', 'prevued', 'glimpse', 'part', 'world', 'beautiful', 'foreign', 'mind', 'innocent', 'who', 'only', 'hope', 'regardless', 'how', 'unbelievably', 'struggling', 'life', 'can', 'be']",The Devil's Miner
