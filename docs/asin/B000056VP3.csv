These movies are usually family friendly and fun to watch.Remember the Titans is about a high school in Virginia that is addicted to football, and the culture revolves around the football teams. The Titans are a football team that is predominantly white, but then the schools integrate in 1971 and they have to intermingle with the African Americans. The coaching job is changed over to Herman Boone, who is an African American with a successful past record. However, he has to earn the trust of the white players and has to establish his leadership. There are many conflicts in this movie that demonstrate how it was difficult to gain acceptance for Boone, however he is a headstrong character and wins their acceptance.This movie showed how the Titans, the football team that Boone coached, strived and worked hard to win the state AAA championship. This movie has a very good storyline and is inspiring. I gave it 4 stars because there were some inappropriate things in this movie that I thought were uncalled for, like a time in the locker room when a boy kisses another boy. There's also some exaggerated moments in the movie that border on being maudlin, however I generally liked the conversations .

That whole `by the book inspirational sports movie' is just so generic and clich&eacute;d and familiar that I can't help but roll my eyes every time I see a trailer for another `Glory Road' or `Miracle'.  I mean, they are all THE SAME.That said, this was one of the films that started the up-rise in the genre (at least this decade) and it remains one of the (if not THE) best.I've said my piece about Denzel Washington before.  He is one of those actors that I really like at times but find highly overrated a lot of the time.  Some of his best work (`Malcolm X' aside) never gets attention, yet his more mediocre work nabs all the accolades (no one will ever convince me that his borderline bore-inducing work in `American Gangster' or his ham-fest in `Training Day' is anywhere near as revolutionary as his stunning work in `He Got Game' or his superb character development in `Man on Fire').  This performance, while not his finest hour, is highly appropriate and beautifully understated.He truly UNDERSTANDS this character.Set in Virginia, in 1971, the film tells (the true story) of a black coaches struggle to unite his football team during the integration of black students into a white school.  The racial tension is used to perfection here, as apposed to making it a gimmick (so many films try TOO HARD in this area).  You can feel the prejudice stripping away, and you feel swells of uplifting power as the emotional gravity of the film overtakes you.This is one of those rare occasions where the inspirational sports movie is actually `inspirational'.You may know who Ryan Gosling, Donald Faison, Kip Pardue, Hayden Panettiere and Kate Bosworth are now, but I guarantee you that in 2000 they were fresh (and nameless) faces.  They all make an impact here (especially Gosling, who was always a star in my book), and they help fill out an exceptional cast of young stars.  Thankfully, Washington holds his own, but never becomes an overwhelming presence.  He allows this film to remain about the students, which is admirable.  Will Patton also delivers a beautifully understated performance as the reluctant Coach Bill Yoast.I thank my sister (and her husband) for pressuring me into finally watching this movie.  I was adamant about resisting this film, but peer pressure got to the best of me and I conceded, and I am so happy for that.  You know me.  I am not a huge fan of this genre.  Yes, I thought `Rocky' was an overrated mess and I didn't find `Rudy' to be the uplifting epic so many claim it to be.

571037,AK6UVFSU07NXH,B000056VP3,Anthony Hinde,"[6, 6]","Like most cinematic versions of true-life stories, &quot;Remember the Titans,&quot; is an idealized version of reality. The main theme focuses on the two-sided coin of racial tension and racial harmony. Such moralistic tales can be heavy going but in this case, using school football as a backdrop, director Boaz Yakin creates a moving and entertaining parable.Set in Virginia around 1971, the story primarily involves the football team at T.C. Williams High. The school is in the middle of a racial integration  process and seems to find the concept, of blacks and whites in physical contact, objectionable. Thrown into this already volatile mix is Coach Boone, a black man from out of state and from a lower grade of football. Boone is placed above Coach Yoast, the current, and white, head of the football department. This strange form of affirmative action is seemingly aimed at political, rather than social, goals.Not surprisingly Coach Yoast, solidly played by Will Patton, takes umbrage at this obvious slight to his tenure, experience and standing in the community. His young daughter, Sheryl, takes the news with even more disgust. Played by Hayden Panettiere, Sheryl steals every scene she's in, creating a funny and memorable character; a small curly haired girl who loves football more than life itself.Seeing the danger of his team abandoning  university scholarships just to show solidarity, Yoast steps back onto the team in a subordinate role to Boone. Densel Washington gives us another strong performance as the forceful, and borderline abusive, Coach Boone. His credo seems to emphasise offence, both on the field and off. This is made clear after he challenges the worst elements of the town to face him, following an incident involving bricks flung through his home's windows.Boone's first act as head coach is to undo the racial divide among his players. Instead, the team is split along offensive and defensive lines. This forced integration soon causes conflict, allowing the audience to explore the large cast of characters in more depth. It is remarkable that so many minor characters stand out in memory and if some of them seem a little shallow, there are limits to what can be achieved in under two hours.True reconciliation, perhaps even racial harmony, does not begin building until the team is lead on a crippling morning run that finishes at the Gettysburg battle  ground. Boone, who set up the event, gives a shaming speech comparing the &quot;cause&quot; that their forefathers fought and died for, to the smaller battles still being fought within their team. In addition, each player was given an ongoing assignment to get to know each and every other member of the team, forcing some level of understanding in most of these young men.There is a fair amount of football in the film but for me, it was the character expositions and interpersonal conflict that held my interest. I'm sure those who enjoy the game will get a lot more out of the film but the game does not overshadow the strong narrative, creative cinematography and moving soundtrack. In the end, the film's value rests on the shoulders of the two leading men rather than on football. These two honourable men may start out as adversaries but, like the team's offensive and defensive captains, they eventually become life-long friends.",4,A lesson in teamwork that the world should learn,1028332800,"08 3, 2002",2002,3336,"['most', 'cinematic', 'versions', 'true-life', 'stories', 'quot', 'Remember', 'Titans', 'quot', 'idealized', 'version', 'reality', 'main', 'theme', 'two-sided', 'coin', 'racial', 'tension', 'racial', 'harmony', 'Such', 'moralistic', 'tales', 'can', 'be', 'heavy', 'going', 'case', 'using', 'school', 'football', 'backdrop', 'director', 'Boaz', 'Yakin', 'moving', 'entertaining', 'parable.Set', 'Virginia', '1971', 'story', 'primarily', 'football', 'team', 'T.C', 'Williams', 'High', 'school', 'middle', 'racial', 'integration', 'process', 'find', 'concept', 'blacks', 'whites', 'physical', 'contact', 'objectionable', 'Thrown', 'already', 'volatile', 'mix', 'Coach', 'Boone', 'black', 'man', 'state', 'lower', 'grade', 'football', 'Boone', 'placed', 'Coach', 'Yoast', 'current', 'white', 'head', 'football', 'department', 'strange', 'form', 'affirmative', 'action', 'seemingly', 'aimed', 'political', 'rather', 'social', 'goals.Not', 'surprisingly', 'Coach', 'Yoast', 'solidly', 'played', 'Will', 'Patton', 'umbrage', 'obvious', 'slight', 'tenure', 'experience', 'standing', 'community', 'young', 'daughter', 'Sheryl', 'news', 'even', 'more', 'disgust', 'Played', 'Hayden', 'Panettiere', 'Sheryl', 'scene', 'creating', 'funny', 'memorable', 'character', 'small', 'curly', 'haired', 'girl', 'who', 'football', 'more', 'life', 'itself.Seeing', 'danger', 'team', 'abandoning', 'university', 'scholarships', 'just', 'show', 'solidarity', 'Yoast', 'back', 'team', 'subordinate', 'role', 'Boone', 'Densel', 'Washington', 'strong', 'performance', 'forceful', 'borderline', 'abusive', 'Coach', 'Boone', 'credo', 'emphasise', 'offence', 'field', 'off', 'made', 'clear', 'worst', 'elements', 'town', 'face', 'following', 'incident', 'involving', 'bricks', 'flung', 'home', 'windows.Boone', 'first', 'act', 'head', 'coach', 'undo', 'racial', 'divide', 'players', 'Instead', 'team', 'split', 'along', 'offensive', 'defensive', 'lines', 'forced', 'integration', 'soon', 'conflict', 'allowing', 'audience', 'explore', 'large', 'cast', 'characters', 'more', 'depth', 'remarkable', 'so', 'many', 'minor', 'characters', 'stand', 'out', 'memory', 'seem', 'little', 'shallow', 'are', 'limits', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'achieved', 'two', 'hours.True', 'reconciliation', 'perhaps', 'even', 'racial', 'harmony', 'not', 'begin', 'building', 'team', 'lead', 'crippling', 'morning', 'run', 'Gettysburg', 'battle', 'ground', 'Boone', 'who', 'set', 'up', 'event', 'shaming', 'speech', 'comparing', 'quot', 'cause', 'quot', 'forefathers', 'fought', 'died', 'smaller', 'battles', 'still', 'being', 'fought', 'team', 'addition', 'player', 'was', 'given', 'ongoing', 'assignment', 'get', 'know', 'other', 'member', 'team', 'forcing', 'level', 'understanding', 'most', 'young', 'men.There', 'fair', 'amount', 'football', 'film', 'was', 'character', 'expositions', 'interpersonal', 'conflict', 'held', 'interest', ""'m"", 'sure', 'who', 'enjoy', 'game', 'will', 'get', 'lot', 'more', 'film', 'game', 'not', 'overshadow', 'strong', 'narrative', 'creative', 'cinematography', 'moving', 'soundtrack', 'end', 'film', 'value', 'shoulders', 'two', 'leading', 'men', 'rather', 'football', 'two', 'honourable', 'men', 'may', 'start', 'out', 'adversaries', 'team', 'offensive', 'defensive', 'captains', 'eventually', 'become', 'life-long', 'friends']",Remember the Titans VHS

All you need is teamwork and respect for one another to be a great team.  Denzel Washington (African American) and Will Patton (White), coach an integrated football team.  The team at first has trouble getting along with each other.  But, after Head Coach Herman Boone (Denzel Washington), delivers an inspirational speech at the site of the Battle of Gettysburg, they respect each other and work as a team.  Julius Campbell, played by Wood Harris, and Gerry Bertier, played by Ryan Hurst, at first do not get along with each other, but they become the leaders of the team.This movie is based on a true story.  It is rated PG and the age range is everybody.  This movie is 1 hour and 53 minutes long but every second of the movie is worth it.  Denzel Washington brings out the best of his character.  All of the actors play their parts perfectly.  This movie shows us that we need to respect each other no matter who we are or what our skin color is and that teamwork prevails.

571048,APP5MBH2BSX6I,B000056VP3,"Brian Hulett ""okierazorbacker2""","[4, 6]","My high school years were about five years later than the 1971 time frame of this story of football and racial tension.  In my Southern town my school was integrated and the one across town had only a handful of black students, and the tension was there, so I can identify with that and testify to younger viewers that the supercharged atmosphere in this film mostly rings true.The basic plot is described in other reviews here, so I won't belabor the point.  The filmmakers do a fair job of presenting said racial tension, and even do an unusually good job with the football action, which is apparently one of the hardest things to get right in Hollywood.  The boot camp atmosphere of the team's August training camp gradually brings about the same type of camaraderie that a military boot camp is meant to, where the players eventually learn to fight for one another and become a team.It's all a bit predictable, with the team eventually forging an unbeaten season and a state championship under the tutelage of their first-year black head coach, and the town naturally falls in love with the coach and the team, although of course the racially insensitive walls have to be beaten down first.  I don't mind the predictability that much because the relationships are handled quite well for the most part and the quick pace of the film doesn't leave us much time to ponder over its imperfections.  They just don't linger long enough to become a problem.Overall, other than a couple of bothersome inaccuracies, this is a family film about racism and football, certainly unique in that regard.  Kids today hopefully will find the racism of 1971 to be brutally ugly, and we who lived it can verify its reality and open avenues of conversation on the topic.  Perhaps the next generation can continue to make steps toward squashing the less obvious racism that our society still struggles with.  Also, in my book any film with Denzel Washington has a leg up on any film without him, and faith in his superb qualities is rewarded here.A few words about inaccuracy:  The film paints a picture of the Titans winning the state title on a last-second TD, which to me is one of the big unforgiveables here.  The championship game was actually a 27-0 blowout, with the Titans so completely whipping their opponent that they ended up with negative offensive yardage.  Disney apparently believes we needed the uberdrama of a last-second TD to push it over the top, whereas to me a blowout, the truth, with the Titans just having fun on the sidelines throughout the second half, could have been just as triumphant for the viewers.Another example of twisting reality to make it fit the Hollywood formula:  The star linebacker who is injured in an automobile accident did not, in reality, miss the championship game.  His wreck was instead AFTER the Titans had won the state title.  Oh, but that doesn't give the screenplay the ""win one for the Gipper"" plot device.  Pardon my indignance, but I just don't like to be emotionally manipulated through lies and exaggerations.Neither of these problems is as bad as presenting one member of the team as a homosexual.  Even in today's football world this is not tolerated by the supermacho type that football requires, and it's an absolute meaningless joke to toss in an attempt at this kind of social harmony with the main theme of racial harmony.  Science fiction.There are other inaccuracies, but mostly understandable ones for the sake of expedience (for instance, Coach Yoast actually had four daughters, and the onscreen lone daughter is a composite of the four, but that's a common practice to simplify the story for staging purposes).  I'm also not a fan of the clumsy scenes of players breaking into singalongs at various times.Taking all these things into account, it's a pleasant and uplifting film that I've seen twice and won't mind viewing against someday, but not one that I've ever gushed about to any friend or coworker.  I'll reserve that for less predictable and less manipulative projects.",4,Exaggerated but wins you over anyway,1076803200,"02 15, 2004",2004,4036,"['high', 'school', 'years', 'were', 'about', 'five', 'years', 'later', '1971', 'time', 'frame', 'story', 'football', 'racial', 'tension', 'Southern', 'town', 'school', 'was', 'integrated', 'one', 'town', 'had', 'only', 'handful', 'black', 'students', 'tension', 'was', 'there', 'can', 'identify', 'testify', 'younger', 'viewers', 'supercharged', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'mostly', 'true.The', 'basic', 'plot', 'described', 'other', 'reviews', 'here', 'wo', ""n't"", 'belabor', 'point', 'filmmakers', 'do', 'fair', 'job', 'presenting', 'said', 'racial', 'tension', 'even', 'do', 'unusually', 'good', 'job', 'football', 'action', 'apparently', 'one', 'hardest', 'things', 'get', 'right', 'Hollywood', 'boot', 'camp', 'atmosphere', 'team', 'August', 'training', 'camp', 'gradually', 'same', 'type', 'camaraderie', 'military', 'boot', 'camp', 'meant', 'where', 'players', 'eventually', 'learn', 'fight', 'one', 'become', 'team.It', 'bit', 'predictable', 'team', 'eventually', 'forging', 'unbeaten', 'season', 'state', 'championship', 'tutelage', 'first-year', 'black', 'head', 'coach', 'town', 'naturally', 'love', 'coach', 'team', 'course', 'racially', 'insensitive', 'walls', 'have', 'be', 'beaten', 'down', 'first', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'predictability', 'much', 'relationships', 'are', 'handled', 'quite', 'well', 'most', 'part', 'quick', 'pace', 'film', ""n't"", 'leave', 'much', 'time', 'ponder', 'over', 'imperfections', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'linger', 'long', 'enough', 'become', 'problem.Overall', 'other', 'couple', 'bothersome', 'inaccuracies', 'family', 'film', 'racism', 'football', 'certainly', 'unique', 'regard', 'Kids', 'today', 'hopefully', 'will', 'find', 'racism', '1971', 'be', 'brutally', 'ugly', 'who', 'lived', 'can', 'verify', 'reality', 'open', 'avenues', 'conversation', 'topic', 'Perhaps', 'next', 'generation', 'can', 'continue', 'make', 'steps', 'squashing', 'less', 'obvious', 'racism', 'society', 'still', 'Also', 'book', 'film', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'leg', 'up', 'film', 'faith', 'superb', 'qualities', 'rewarded', 'here.A', 'few', 'words', 'inaccuracy', 'film', 'picture', 'Titans', 'winning', 'state', 'title', 'last-second', 'TD', 'one', 'big', 'unforgiveables', 'here', 'championship', 'game', 'was', 'actually', '27-0', 'blowout', 'Titans', 'so', 'completely', 'whipping', 'opponent', 'ended', 'up', 'negative', 'offensive', 'yardage', 'Disney', 'apparently', 'needed', 'uberdrama', 'last-second', 'TD', 'push', 'top', 'whereas', 'blowout', 'truth', 'Titans', 'just', 'having', 'fun', 'sidelines', 'second', 'half', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'triumphant', 'viewers.Another', 'example', 'twisting', 'reality', 'make', 'fit', 'Hollywood', 'formula', 'star', 'linebacker', 'who', 'injured', 'automobile', 'accident', 'did', 'not', 'reality', 'miss', 'championship', 'game', 'wreck', 'was', 'instead', 'AFTER', 'Titans', 'had', 'won', 'state', 'title', 'Oh', ""n't"", 'give', 'screenplay', 'win', 'one', 'Gipper', 'plot', 'device', 'Pardon', 'indignance', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'be', 'emotionally', 'manipulated', 'lies', 'exaggerations.Neither', 'problems', 'as', 'bad', 'presenting', 'one', 'member', 'team', 'homosexual', 'Even', 'today', 'football', 'world', 'not', 'tolerated', 'supermacho', 'type', 'football', 'absolute', 'meaningless', 'joke', 'toss', 'attempt', 'kind', 'social', 'harmony', 'main', 'theme', 'racial', 'harmony', 'Science', 'are', 'other', 'inaccuracies', 'mostly', 'understandable', 'ones', 'sake', 'expedience', 'instance', 'Coach', 'Yoast', 'actually', 'had', 'four', 'daughters', 'onscreen', 'lone', 'daughter', 'composite', 'four', 'common', 'practice', 'simplify', 'story', 'staging', 'purposes', ""'m"", 'also', 'not', 'fan', 'clumsy', 'scenes', 'players', 'breaking', 'singalongs', 'various', 'times.Taking', 'things', 'account', 'pleasant', 'uplifting', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'twice', 'wo', ""n't"", 'mind', 'viewing', 'someday', 'not', 'one', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'gushed', 'friend', 'coworker', ""'ll"", 'reserve', 'less', 'predictable', 'less', 'manipulative', 'projects']",Remember the Titans VHS

In order to get the white and black students to play together Boone hires Yoast as his defensive coach and takes the kids to camp to give them a tough lesson in brotherhood. After hard work and being pushed by the coach to get to know each other and see past the colour of each others skin the Titans are born and on entering the season they become an unstoppable team.The Review: Simply the story telling, the inspirational acting and the fact that this is based on a true story makes this film a masterpiece and something truly memorable. As a person who takes an interest in the race relations of the mid 60s and 70s America, this is an educational film that shows me these decades weren't all full of racial hatred. Denzel, once again takes on a convincing role as Coach Boone. Washington embraces roles from this era and he showed us once again why he is considered one of the greatest African American actors of all time. Ryan Hurst who plays Gerry Bertier, and who in my opinion is a very underrated actor gave an exceptional performance when displaying the young white kid full of hate who then learned the error of his ways to become best friends with Julius Campbell his Black athletic equal.A very good movie which I would highly recommend to the masses.",5,Simply Fantastic.,1202688000,"02 11, 2008",2008,1573,"['Story', '1971', 'T.C', 'Williams', 'High', 'School', 'desegregated', 'Herman', 'Boone', 'Played', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'hired', 'Head', 'Coach', 'football', 'team', 'place', 'previous', 'coach', 'Bill', 'Yoast', 'played', 'Bill', 'Patton', 'replacing', 'outrage', 'white', 'kids', 'refuse', 'play', 'black', 'coach', 'order', 'get', 'white', 'black', 'students', 'play', 'together', 'Boone', 'Yoast', 'defensive', 'coach', 'kids', 'camp', 'give', 'tough', 'lesson', 'brotherhood', 'hard', 'work', 'being', 'pushed', 'coach', 'get', 'know', 'other', 'see', 'colour', 'others', 'skin', 'Titans', 'are', 'born', 'entering', 'season', 'become', 'unstoppable', 'team.The', 'Review', 'Simply', 'story', 'telling', 'inspirational', 'acting', 'fact', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'film', 'masterpiece', 'something', 'truly', 'memorable', 'person', 'who', 'interest', 'race', 'relations', 'mid', '60s', '70s', 'America', 'educational', 'film', 'decades', 'were', ""n't"", 'full', 'racial', 'hatred', 'Denzel', 'once', 'again', 'convincing', 'role', 'Coach', 'Boone', 'Washington', 'roles', 'era', 'showed', 'once', 'again', 'why', 'considered', 'one', 'greatest', 'African', 'American', 'actors', 'time', 'Ryan', 'Hurst', 'who', 'Gerry', 'Bertier', 'who', 'opinion', 'very', 'underrated', 'actor', 'gave', 'exceptional', 'performance', 'when', 'displaying', 'young', 'white', 'kid', 'full', 'hate', 'who', 'then', 'learned', 'error', 'ways', 'become', 'best', 'friends', 'Julius', 'Campbell', 'Black', 'athletic', 'equal.A', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'masses']",Remember the Titans VHS

This Disney movie starring Denzel Washington is a powerful, true story of a battle against the corrupt forced segregation at the high school in Virginia called T.C. Williams High School located in Alexandria, Virginia where a racial upheaval occurs when football coach Yoast played by Will Patton hires an African American coach named Herman Boone played by Denzel Washington to coach the T.C. Williams Titans and integrate T.C. Williams High School and is threatened with being fired if they lose a single game during their 13 game season. The players meet and hate each other at first but gradually learn to respect each other and use teamwork to overcome their petty differences.This movie is a marvelous portrayal of the struggle of integration of all, I repeat, ALL colors and the continuing struggle against the corrupt racial segregation and the ugliness of it's outcomes. The story is true and probably the story could not be better told than from the actual former players who actually played the championship game during this turbulent period in1971. The two coaches Yoast and Boone worked together to bring the Titans to victory in the Championship game amidst the racial turmoil and strife that clouds the atmosphere. Disney definitely scores a touchdown with a riveting true story of a turbulent time in America's history. Amidst all of the turmoil and hatred, the spirit of the Titans during this historic year will forever be remembered around the nation as one of the greatest achievements in high school football history. While Alexandria might have been going through racial tough times during the late 60s and early 70s, today, it's now a very diverse city of many different peoples (I lived there once) but de facto segregation has been and continues to be a huge obstacle to integration today.

Not only that, but the football team must also incorporate black players into its roster, providing for some very high tension among the white team members, as well as the newcomers.Boone, however, is unshaken by this tension, providing Denzel Washington an outlet for yet another riveting performance. He comes through unscathed and triumphant, playing Boone with a drive and an earnestness that have become Washington's trademark as an actor. Boone becomes a hard-hitting coach, forcing his players, black and white, to work together, putting them not only through the physical exercises, but making them get to know one another, pairing them off with a person of different race.As you may have guessed, the teammates get to know one another and start to get along, too, though the movie's hurdles do not stop there. After a return from football training camp, the now-friendly players must face the ongoing racial hatred and intolerance in their community. THe movie goes from being interesting to powerful in this turn of events, as the group finds themselves in a place where their friendships are looked down upon.As the movie works all of these conflicts out, it tells a very uplifting story. Based on real-life events, it keeps our interest by evoking such a high human emotion factor that we come to care for the characters, and what will come of the situations they face. The struggle between black and white soon evolves into a struggle of unity versus ignorance, and the segue is well-handled by director Boaz Yakin, who instills in his film a great deal of heart, human strength, and courage.Still, there are minor flaws. Many will no doubt agree that the film is advertised as a family feature, and for the most part it is. But there are some pieces of the story I was shocked to find included in the story, such as that of one football player's homosexuality, and his forthright revelation of his orientation in the locker room. This seems highly out of place in the movie, and may have worked better were this not a family-oriented movie.I am also left wondering why a movie about racial unity tends to lean more to one side of the arena. All around our characters there is a mix of white culture, from songs to styles, something the movie does profusely. The black members of the football team are seen as invaders, but the movie never really gives us a chance to get to know how they feel about being cast into an uncomfortable situation. The movie is not hypocritical, but it does lose some focus from what the central message is trying to say.As with any good movie, you're going to have your share of flaws, and &quot;Remember the Titans&quot; is one of them. There are elements that some will find out of place, but the overall effect the movie has is more than enough to suffice seeing it. The story of the human spirit is outstanding and effective, while creating characters we can relate to and care for. Don't dismiss it as a sports movie; it has more to offer.",4,"Despite its flaws, the film delivers!",991180800,"05 30, 2001",2001,3656,"['quot', 'Remember', 'Titans', 'quot', 'film', 'good', 'movie', 'flaws', 'one', 'might', 'say', 'story', 'two', 'coaches', 'same', 'football', 'team', 'racial', 'turmoil', 'America', 'struggle', 'keep', 'team', 'together', 'movie', 'also', 'members', 'team', 'showing', 'reactions', 'being', 'placed', 'together', 'same', 'group', 'growth', 'team', 'more', 'importantly', 'friends', 'two', 'grounds', 'movie', 'Washington', 'Herman', 'Boone', 'football', 'coach', 'who', 'new', 'law', 'passed', 'opposing', 'racial', 'segregation', 'South', 'place', 'fifteen-year', 'coach', 'Bill', 'Yoast', 'played', 'Will', 'Patton', 'Not', 'only', 'football', 'team', 'must', 'also', 'incorporate', 'black', 'players', 'roster', 'providing', 'very', 'high', 'tension', 'white', 'team', 'members', 'as', 'well', 'newcomers.Boone', 'however', 'unshaken', 'tension', 'providing', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'outlet', 'yet', 'riveting', 'performance', 'unscathed', 'triumphant', 'playing', 'Boone', 'drive', 'earnestness', 'have', 'become', 'Washington', 'trademark', 'actor', 'Boone', 'hard-hitting', 'coach', 'forcing', 'players', 'black', 'white', 'work', 'together', 'putting', 'not', 'only', 'physical', 'exercises', 'making', 'get', 'know', 'one', 'pairing', 'off', 'person', 'different', 'race.As', 'may', 'have', 'guessed', 'teammates', 'get', 'know', 'one', 'start', 'get', 'along', 'too', 'movie', 'hurdles', 'do', 'not', 'stop', 'there', 'return', 'football', 'training', 'camp', 'now-friendly', 'players', 'must', 'face', 'ongoing', 'racial', 'hatred', 'intolerance', 'community', 'THe', 'movie', 'being', 'interesting', 'powerful', 'turn', 'events', 'group', 'place', 'where', 'friendships', 'are', 'looked', 'upon.As', 'movie', 'conflicts', 'out', 'very', 'uplifting', 'story', 'Based', 'real-life', 'events', 'interest', 'evoking', 'high', 'human', 'emotion', 'factor', 'come', 'care', 'characters', 'what', 'will', 'come', 'situations', 'face', 'struggle', 'black', 'white', 'soon', 'struggle', 'unity', 'versus', 'ignorance', 'segue', 'well-handled', 'director', 'Boaz', 'Yakin', 'who', 'film', 'great', 'deal', 'heart', 'human', 'strength', 'courage.Still', 'are', 'minor', 'flaws', 'Many', 'will', 'doubt', 'agree', 'film', 'advertised', 'family', 'feature', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'pieces', 'story', 'was', 'shocked', 'find', 'included', 'story', 'such', 'one', 'football', 'player', 'homosexuality', 'forthright', 'revelation', 'orientation', 'locker', 'room', 'highly', 'place', 'movie', 'may', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'were', 'not', 'family-oriented', 'movie.I', 'am', 'also', 'left', 'wondering', 'why', 'movie', 'racial', 'unity', 'lean', 'more', 'one', 'side', 'arena', 'characters', 'mix', 'white', 'culture', 'songs', 'styles', 'something', 'movie', 'profusely', 'black', 'members', 'football', 'team', 'are', 'seen', 'invaders', 'movie', 'never', 'really', 'chance', 'get', 'know', 'how', 'feel', 'being', 'cast', 'uncomfortable', 'situation', 'movie', 'not', 'hypocritical', 'lose', 'focus', 'what', 'central', 'message', 'trying', 'say.As', 'good', 'movie', ""'re"", 'going', 'have', 'share', 'flaws', 'quot', 'Remember', 'Titans', 'quot', 'one', 'are', 'elements', 'will', 'find', 'place', 'overall', 'effect', 'movie', 'more', 'enough', 'suffice', 'seeing', 'story', 'human', 'spirit', 'outstanding', 'effective', 'creating', 'characters', 'can', 'relate', 'care', 'Do', ""n't"", 'dismiss', 'sports', 'movie', 'more', 'offer']",Remember the Titans VHS

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[0, 0]","Movies that stimulate, inspire, and deeply move the viewer on several emotional layers are forever a part of cinematic lore.  And REMEMBER THE TITANS is a member of this prestigious group, capturing the tension and drama--and outright ugliness--of a high school, and in particular, its football team, during the first year of integration.  Based (albeit loosely) on the 1971 season of the T.C. Williams Titans, this is a high octane, ultimately feel good thriller running a full gambit of emotions from the perspectives of the African-American and white players--from distrust, to anger, to acceptance, to camaraderie.  And as a metaphorical microcosm, these emotions are amplified in the relationship between new head coach Herman Boone (Denzel Washington) and former head coach Bill Yoast (Will Patton).  The chemistry between the two actors is mesmerizing, as Coach Patton comes to grips with being replaced as head coach, while Coach Boone, a rigid disciplinarian, has to deal with the racism that permeates the culture of 1971 Virginia.The summer boot camp, the practices, the confrontations (players and coaches), and the games are believable and heart-pounding; there is heartache, even tragedy, yet the Titans overcome considerable odds to post an unbeaten regular season, with the exclamation point firmly placed at the end of the game for the state championship.  One star off for the somewhat sanitized depiction of racism (this is Disney, of course), yet with each viewing of REMEMBER THE TITANS you'll find yourself cheering from your seat.

Well, despite its simplicity, we still love it for what it is. Sports films like this one, Remember the Titans, make us feel good about life and sometimes competition. Titans certainly has a unique way of repeating this particular formula. The film is set in the early 70's when black and white are still divided. Here, it's about unity and respecting each other despite our differences. Even though it isn't entirely accurate, the true story is told extremely well, with a couple of exceptions. First off, I will say that Sheryl Yoast (played by Hayden Panettiere) really bugged me whenver she was onscreen. Her energetic, as well as sweet, personality made me cringe. And some of the dialogue a bit too overdone and preachy. But despite the annoying little girl and the preachy dialogue, Remember the Titans is still a very good sports movie. It's paced very well, it has some appropriately humorous and dramatic moments, and it certainly has solid performance by Denzel Washington, Will Patton, and those who are the Titans.Grade: B-",4,"""If we don't come together right now on this hallowed ground, we too will be destroyed.....""",1277510400,"06 26, 2010",2010,1143,"['know', 'sports', 'formula', 'team', 'fights', 'championship', 'roadblocks', 'ahead', 'Well', 'simplicity', 'still', 'love', 'what', 'Sports', 'films', 'one', 'Remember', 'Titans', 'make', 'feel', 'good', 'life', 'sometimes', 'competition', 'Titans', 'certainly', 'unique', 'way', 'repeating', 'particular', 'formula', 'film', 'set', 'early', '70', 'when', 'black', 'white', 'are', 'still', 'divided', 'Here', 'unity', 'respecting', 'other', 'differences', 'Even', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'accurate', 'true', 'story', 'told', 'extremely', 'well', 'couple', 'exceptions', 'First', 'will', 'say', 'Sheryl', 'Yoast', 'played', 'Hayden', 'Panettiere', 'really', 'bugged', 'was', 'onscreen', 'energetic', 'as', 'well', 'sweet', 'personality', 'made', 'cringe', 'dialogue', 'bit', 'too', 'overdone', 'preachy', 'annoying', 'little', 'girl', 'preachy', 'dialogue', 'Remember', 'Titans', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'sports', 'movie', 'paced', 'very', 'well', 'appropriately', 'humorous', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'certainly', 'solid', 'performance', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Will', 'Patton', 'who', 'are', 'Titans.Grade', 'B-']",Remember the Titans VHS

Once again, Bruckheimer hits with this inspirational human-interest story.  This script was rejected dozens of times before it found its way to Bruckheimer's desk.  He immediately saw the potential and began shopping it around until Disney picked it up.It is a true story of a high school football team in 1971 during the first year of forced integration in the Virginia.  The team members are compelled to confront years of racial hatred and bigotry if they are to come together as a team and win.  To add to the tension, a black coach is installed as head coach, replacing a popular white coach with a history of having winning seasons.Coach Boone (Denzel Washington) runs the team like a marine boot camp.  He forces the boys to put their prejudices aside so they can coalesce into a winning football team.  He faces obstacles within the team as well as those from the parents and the school board.  Everyone is waiting for him to fail so they can pounce on him.  He never gives them the satisfaction.This is an stirring story that accurately represents the open racial hostilities of the time, especially regarding forced integration.  It gives us excellent character development of coach Boone and coach Yoast (Will Patton), as well as players Gerry Bertier (Ryan Hurst) and Julius Campbell (Wood Harris).  Though the plot is predictable, it is such an inspirational story that it doesn't become tedious.  There are a few oversimplifications of complex issues, like when the team overcomes a lifetime of bigotry in two weeks of football camp.  However, there are also a number of memorable and emotional scenes.The acting is terrific across the board.  Denzell Washington gives the coach a very hard edge while maintaining a certain tough charisma.  Will Patton does an outstanding job portraying coach Yoast, a man stuck in the middle of forces that are ripping his life apart.  This is the best performance I've seen by Patton, who has always been a solid supporting actor.  The selection of Wood Harris and Ryan Hurst for the student leads is a bit of a stretch age wise (Hurst is 25 and looks older, and Harris is 31).  However, both actors deliver brilliant performances, supercharged with intensity on and off the field.  Eleven-year-old Hayden Panettiere is fantastic as coach Yoast's football obsessed daughter, stealing every scene in which she appears.The DVD has a good deal of interesting material including interviews with the real coaches Boone and Yoast as well as player interviews.  The DTS sound on this DVD is nothing short of awesome, making the music powerful and sounds of the action on the field explosive.This film is classic Bruckheimer.

However, ""Remember the Titans"" made me feel divided because it seemed to focus on two very unbalanced issues-football and prejudice-by keeping them on an ""even"" level. On one hand, this film is very powerful and speaks to your emotions through the integration of the white and black community in the South. However, on the other hand, it spends too much time categorizing people and situations into a tight, neat little box. The ultimate impression left is that this could have been so much more; I speculate that Disney's knack for erring on the side of overdoing and overstating had much to do with this.&quot;Remember the Titans&quot; has dents in its premise. It seems to beg the point that football camaraderie is parallel to racial harmony. The movie implies this message through a series of events: the team must get along to win, if they get along, they have a better shot at winning; if a black and white coach can get along, then prejudice will dissipate; if the team achieves its ultimate goal, then people will remember how we can get along as a community and that we can reach for this anytime there is prejudice.Other flaws were rampant clich&eacute;s. The black and white players don't along at first, then they get along and sing songs together on the bus in harmony. We have the halftime speech from Coach Boone (""Give it all you got boys""). We have the big oaf of a football player who ""can't go to college"" because he doesn't have the brains to do it. We have the ""redneck"" stereotypes. And we, of course, have the ""win one for the Gipper"" premise, and, last but not least, the high school football championship scenario. All these scenarios seemed to trivialize what should have been a deeper message. Rather than using stereotypes and predictable events, the producers could have focused more on the social aspect of racism and prejudice, and ways to alleviate it, and it would have had a much stronger effect on its viewers.I don't mean to completely knock this movie. ""Remember The Titans"" definitely captures the attention of its audience through its message of believing in oneself and coming together as a team. In its ultimate essence, it delves into many of the controversies that we handle in our time: prejudice, determination of goals, fulfillment of dreams and the obstacles that get in the way of those dreams. The action and dialogue may be a bit hokey at times, but the bottom line is that this film exerts a positive final message about what one can accomplish if there is enough effort put into that goal. &quot;Remember the Titans&quot; illustrates how there are ways to get past life's obstacles and prejudices and press on to the next level. If Disney could have handled it a little different, however, it would have been a substantially better movie.",3,Serious Issues Mangled by Disney,1071273600,"12 13, 2003",2003,2954,"['film', 'conclusive', 'message', 'achieving', 'goals', 'racial', 'harmony-is', 'perhaps', 'stronger', 'archetypes', 'used', 'achieve', 'effect', 'However', 'Remember', 'Titans', 'made', 'feel', 'divided', 'seemed', 'focus', 'two', 'very', 'unbalanced', 'issues-football', 'prejudice-by', 'keeping', 'even', 'level', 'one', 'hand', 'film', 'very', 'powerful', 'emotions', 'integration', 'white', 'black', 'community', 'South', 'However', 'other', 'hand', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'categorizing', 'people', 'situations', 'tight', 'neat', 'little', 'box', 'ultimate', 'impression', 'left', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'speculate', 'Disney', 'knack', 'erring', 'side', 'overdoing', 'overstating', 'had', 'much', 'do', 'this.', 'quot', 'Remember', 'Titans', 'quot', 'dents', 'premise', 'beg', 'point', 'football', 'camaraderie', 'parallel', 'racial', 'harmony', 'movie', 'message', 'series', 'events', 'team', 'must', 'get', 'win', 'get', 'along', 'have', 'better', 'shot', 'winning', 'black', 'white', 'coach', 'can', 'get', 'along', 'then', 'prejudice', 'will', 'dissipate', 'team', 'ultimate', 'goal', 'then', 'people', 'will', 'remember', 'how', 'can', 'get', 'along', 'community', 'can', 'reach', 'anytime', 'prejudice.Other', 'flaws', 'were', 'rampant', 'clich', 'eacute', 'black', 'white', 'players', 'do', ""n't"", 'along', 'first', 'then', 'get', 'along', 'sing', 'songs', 'together', 'bus', 'harmony', 'have', 'halftime', 'speech', 'Coach', 'Boone', 'Give', 'got', 'boys', 'have', 'big', 'oaf', 'football', 'player', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'college', ""n't"", 'have', 'brains', 'do', 'have', 'redneck', 'stereotypes', 'course', 'have', 'win', 'one', 'Gipper', 'premise', 'last', 'not', 'least', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'championship', 'scenario', 'scenarios', 'seemed', 'trivialize', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'deeper', 'message', 'Rather', 'using', 'stereotypes', 'predictable', 'events', 'producers', 'could', 'have', 'focused', 'more', 'social', 'aspect', 'racism', 'prejudice', 'ways', 'alleviate', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'much', 'stronger', 'effect', 'viewers.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'completely', 'knock', 'movie', 'Remember', 'Titans', 'definitely', 'attention', 'audience', 'message', 'believing', 'coming', 'together', 'team', 'ultimate', 'essence', 'many', 'controversies', 'handle', 'time', 'prejudice', 'determination', 'goals', 'fulfillment', 'dreams', 'obstacles', 'get', 'way', 'dreams', 'action', 'dialogue', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'hokey', 'times', 'bottom', 'line', 'film', 'positive', 'final', 'message', 'what', 'one', 'can', 'accomplish', 'enough', 'effort', 'put', 'goal', 'quot', 'Remember', 'Titans', 'quot', 'how', 'are', 'ways', 'get', 'past', 'life', 'obstacles', 'prejudices', 'press', 'next', 'level', 'Disney', 'could', 'have', 'handled', 'little', 'different', 'however', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'substantially', 'better', 'movie']",Remember the Titans VHS

571089,A2GPN2VKS8E77C,B000056VP3,HAMLET,"[1, 1]","Starring Academy Award winner Denzel Washinton (Best Supporting Actor""Glory,"" 1989), this magnificent and inspiring true story from Walt Disney Pictures about the first integrated football team is very well made. In fact, had it not been for Disney, this would have been an R-rated film, as the original script was full of profanity (every third word being the f-word and every fourth word being the n-word). However, the head of Walt Disney Pictures ordered Jerry Bruckheimer (who produced this film, ""Glory Road"" & the ""Pirates Of The Caribbean"" & ""National Treasure"" films for Disney, along with the upcoming 4th installment in the ""Pirates"" series and the upcoming ""Lone Ranger"" film) to remove all offensive language from the script, as Disney WOULD NEVER produce anything with profanity, sexual content or graphic violence. All that remains are 3 uses of ""Damn,"" 2 uses of ""Hell"" & 1 use of ""A--,"" all appropriately used. This movie tackles racism head on (pun intended) without using the ""N"" word (probably the only feature film to do so. Refreshing, I must say. Kudos to Walt Disney Pictures and Jerry Bruckheimer for remaining committed to producing family movies. The performances in this movie are inspiring, from Will Patton (""Entrapment"") and the lovely Hayden Pannettiere (excuse me if my spelling is off), here very precocious as the football-loving daughter of Coach Yoast (Patton) to the relatively unknown actors playing the football team. Comic at times, but above all, a drama that soars high above the crowd as a winner. I just have one minor gripe: WHY CALL IT A DIRECTOR'S CUT WHEN SCENES ARE SHORTENED OR REMOVED COMPLETELY? In my opinion, a Director's Cut should INCLUDE addiotional scenes, NOT either shorten or delete them. Also, a scene was missing that I saw when this movie aired on ABC where Ronnie Bass' dad was talking to members of the board about moving to Virginia (or something like that). It wasn't included in the ""Director's Cut."" Habing ranted about this, it's a great movie. Recommended for the whole family.

Denzel Washington gives a masterful performance as the honest, brutal and determined Coach Boone. It is one of his best after The Hurricane, I couldn't take my eyes off Denzel. His character was a revelation, someone I'd really like to play in a movie. The supporting characters do just fine and give Denzel his back-up.

I think the fact that Remember the Titans is a true story helped it become more enjoyable and more real. If this wasn't a true story you'd probably be saying ""yeah, right"" to some of the events. The thought of knowing this really happened and that the characters are real made the experience much more touching and entertaining.

However, there's more to it than that. For one, Bertier gets into that car accident which renders him paralyzed from the waist down. The movie shows all kinds of prejudices and violence, but doesn't forget to show that there are more issues, like such an accident, for people to worry about.

You fumble the football, and you will run a mile. Now let's go to work."" This is a quote from one, of many, inspirational speeches by Coach Herman Boone about the game of football in the dramatic film, Remember the Titans. The movie Remember the Titans is a feel good and inspirational movie of the harsh truth in the later 1900s. This movie is filled with obstacles between a football team, the bond they created, and there desire to work as one for their single goal of winning a championship. As an audience member this movie will make you watch it over and over again as it is truly worth the money.In the movie Remember the Titans, obstacles overwhelm the football team of T.C. Williams High School. Based on a true story, the high school has many difficulties to overcome in order to be successful. For starters, an obvious obstacle in this story is that a new football coach is hired for the football team. Now in modern day, this seems to be no issue, but the setting is the 1970s and T.C. Williams is becoming an inter-racial school. The coach being hired is African-American, and the old coach, a white man, is demoted to defensive coordinator. Also, the players of the team are split and do not like to interact due to racial hatred at each other's groups. The football team now must find a way to overcome these difficult issues to have a successful year. It won't be an easy road as their team goes against the rest of society, and they must learn to adjust. To over come this adversity the team must bond as one instead of split as two.With hatred brewing new head football coach, Herman Boone, decides a plan must be made in order to have a successful football team at T.C. Williams. To start off his plan, coach Herman Boone gathers the football players for training camp. Right before departure, all the white players go on one bus, and all the African-Americans on another. Coach immediately discovers this situation and orders everyone off the buses. He then splits the players according to offense and defense, which mixes the races. With Coach Boone satisfied, the team sets off for training camp. At training camp, Coach Boone makes players learn about another person of a different race in order to form a team bond. Players spend time with one another and find similar likings. This leads to more teamwork on the field, instead of everyone playing for themselves. Another act Coach Boone does, is he makes players bunk with a player of a different race to see how they are more a like then different. The players learn to like each other, and find more success in their practices when they play to one another's strengths and work as one. The bond that Coach Boone created with the team helps T.C. Williams have a better chance at their ultimate goal in winning a championship.Ever since becoming the head coach, Herman Boone had a goal on winning the state championship. After he got his team to play as one, Coach Herman Boone knew that winning the title was definitely possible. He had players moved around for the better of the team. He even stuck to the same game plan during the season, and stressed game in and game out that heart is how you play the game of football. He strived to be perfect in every aspect of the game, and would not tolerate any thing that would hurt the team. This strategy ultimately allowed T.C. Williams to keep on winning during the season. Low and behold with heart and talent Coach Herman Boone found his team in the championship game. The Coach over came integrity and racial boundaries to get to this point. Absolutely nothing was going to stand in this team's desire to win the championship. With their minds focused and their hearts set on the title, T.C. Williams won the crown and were the state champs! It was a well-deserved title for a team that inspired all.The movie Remember the Titans has a lot of heart and teamwork that proves worthy in the end. Without the actions of the Coach Herman Boone, T.C. Williams would have never won the championship. This is a story that has inspired me to never give up. It is a movie of both struggle and success. It will keep you asking for more.

Daniel,"[2, 4]","As A Fellow Amazon.com Reviewer Told Me, &quot;Always be Honest and Speak Your Mind.&quot; And That's What I'll Do.Remember the Titans is the true story of a small town in Virginia during the 1970's. The &quot;white&quot; high school and the colored &quot;Black&quot; high school are forced to combine into one school, the T.C Williams High School. From then on, everything turns to trouble, there are rallies, fires and fights. But just as the current football coach Yoast is about to enter the Virginian high school football hall of fame, he is replacded by his job by the new head coach, Coach Boone (amazingly acted by Denzel Washington), an experienced African- American Football Coach, from North Carolina. He asked Coash Yoast, to be assistant head coach when the two high schools combine. On top of this being between the two coaches, they both have to figure out how to bring the two teams into one team, the Titans and try to end the prejudice between the white and the colored players. Despite of the above description, the movie does a great job balancing itself so that it is dramatic and you are able to understand what racism was like during that time period, but there is plenty of humor to cause you not to be upset during the entire film. This Movie is Defintly a Must Buy, becuase I have seen this movie numerous times, and never get tired of its humor, drama and prejiduce. This movie has made me laugh, cry, and made me very much wiser about the world. I suggest buying it, but if you are always like me you always have to see it first. But I Can almost guarantee that you will absolutely love and enjoy this film.

Yost has had 15 winning seasons and has been nominated for the Virginia High School Hall of Fame and people just can't believe that he has been replaced. Coach Boone steps into a hotbed of hatred and racial tension as the team is newly integrated with both black and white players and the tensions are high.Coach Boone asks Yost to be the assistant coach and at first he refuses but he sees the racial tension between the black and white players and Coach Boone and he agrees as the white players will refuse to play unless he participates with the team. Football camp is bad because the tempers flare and many conflicts take place over racial tension. Slowly the team begins to reach some sense of teamwork and they begin to gel into a good team.

In the hospital, Gary watches on TV as his team fights its way to victory in the Virginia State Championship. Jewish director Yakin sets up a shot where White light from above shines over the prostrate Gary, who then lifts his arms in a Christ-like pose.He has given everything so that his Black teammates may play. No opportunity is missed to show that the world is a better place when Blacks replace Whites.

It was interesting to see their reactions to the chasm that existed on the &quot;battlefield&quot; of the public school system. Although &quot;RtT&quot; doesn't explore the issues of the time in a substantive way, the film makes it easy to believe that the situations were real.  The football field action is impressively filmed and the soundtrack is outstanding.Will Patton and a terrific cast of young actors will entertain you and make you believe for the run of the movie.  And although some scenes are corny, (every scene that features Coach Yost's daughter!) you find yourself caught up in not only the game, but in what it represents as a centerpiece for a small town or city.I confess that there is no movie featuring Denzel Washington that I don't like!

But when the education committee is forced to merge two schools (one of white race, the other African-American), the football tradition is put under test.To make things worse, Herman Boone (Washington) is brought from South Carolina to teach as a lead coach of the titans, the team of TC Williams High school. His arrival is bad news to the regent coach, Bill Yoast, a kind man, beloved and admired who's relegated to an assistant coach position.Boone and Yoast accept to work Together, putting their differences aside, while the boys began a long training where they are supposed to learn to respect and tolerate each other to form a united team.In that process, they also learn that your skin color doesn't matter. And once that barrier is broken, friendship blooms between the boys.But one thing is to survive camp and the other to confront a community full of prejudice. The Titans are soon forced to face their own realities, social violence, racism, corruption, infuriated parents, friends and personal threats.Remember the Titans shows you can make a sentimental drama that's effective and not manipulative. Although it harbors one or two clich&eacute;s, the triumph of this film lies in the honesty and strength played by their characters and the screenwriter's clarity to not sweeten or soften the reality these characters lived.Denzel Washington delivers a stellar performance as the tough Boon. His demands are sometimes harsh and mean, but he's an honorable man, a winner.In Will Patton, who gives life to Hill Yoast, Washington finds a perfect complement. As Boone, Yoast is a remarkable man, decent and with a great passion for football and his boys.The big surprises are the Titans themselves, a group of characters described in sufficient detail to interest us in their lives, relationships and future. They deliver the best as the kids that learn the true value of friendship, the respect of your equals and the satisfaction to be part of a team.A Dream team in this case.

However since the Titans play for an all white school, the school system decides that it is time to intigrate the school with some African American students which leads to a change on the football field as well. This marks the arrival of Coach Herman Boone ( Denzel Washington). Despite his impressive record, Coach Yoast is demoted to Boone's assistant and Boone is made the new head coach. Boone is extremely tough and opinionated, and likes to shake things up. His coaching methods are met with skepticism and resentment from the entire team when he forces the players to look past the color of their skin and treat each other with respect. Watching Boone and Yoast put aside their differences, and turn a group of hostile young men into champions, will give us all a reason to ""Remember the Titans"".Remember the Titans is an inspiring film that is based on a true story. Disney effectively portrays the story behind the film with talented actors and an amazing musical score. Denzel Washington is great as always. His portrayal of coach Herman Boone is driven with intensity, integrity, and determination. Will Patton gave the best performance as Bill Yoast. He is torn by envy and hate, but still manages to do the best job possible. There was a lot of inner conflict that the character had to overcome, so the transition is really emotional. The football team itself is full of talented young actors that really symolized the spirit of teamwork. All of them do an outstanding job and actually had to go through a football training camp to make their roles believeable. The football action in this film is hard hitting, suspenseful, and realistic. The last thing that amazed me about this film, was that Disney realisticly captured the racism and segregation that went on during that time. It gives an extra sense of tension to the already dramatic film.Disney definately scores a touchdown with Remember the Tians. The acting, emotional story, and realistic look at racism makes for a very dramatic and important film. The film is also fun to watch with the hard hitting and realistic football action. The DVD is amazing. You get two commentaries - one from the real life coaches Boone and Yoast, and the other from the crew members on the film. There are also two featurettes, an ABC special, and much more.

Thankfully, that never happened.  Yes, there was racism in the story and we got the impression that it was wrong, but no one ever held up a sign or gave a long monologue about the issue...the film just told it's story and the message was naturally recieved, just the way I like it.  I don't give it five stars simply because it sometimes brings up some of the many cliches found in sports movies.  Yes, these events all happened in real life, but I just wish I wasn't feeling like it was all done so perfectly in the film's plot...but it is a Disney movie.  Anyway, Denzel Washington shines as the new football coach for T. C. Williams High School in Alexandria, Virginia.  It was nice to see a coach who didn't just go ahead and lay out enormous, life-changing ambitions for his new team.  Instead, he came with an attitude that said ""this is what we're gonna do and this is how we're going to do it.""  Plus, I always like it when a coach is shown to have an education when so many coach characters are portrayed as having roughly a 5th-grade -level of learning.  I also like the interactions between Mr. Washington and Will Patton, who plays his predesessor/new defensive coordinator...there is obvious tension in the beginning which both men obviously carefully crafted for the big screen and then we get a chance to witness the transformation into mutual respect or even some sort of friendship.  It was thanks to these two men that the issues surrounding racism were properly played out as I had discribed earlier.  Of course, a coach is nothing without his team, and a group of young men nicely play the dynamic of the Titans, who must have an undefeated season in order for their coach to keep his job.  Overall, this is a great film for audience members of varying ages and I highly reccomend it.

But I happen to love most of the Disney sports flicks. And REMEMBER THE TITANS is Disney's best sports-related film! REMEMBER THE TITANS sets in the 70s, and it's a true story based on two very different football teams (one black team and one white team) who come together as one united team with the help and inspiration of their two coaches, and end up changing their high school forever, despite their differences.I just loved REMEMBER THE TITANS, and it's an excellent film. The football scenes are even awesome, too.

We had to play them whenwe were in same region. The main Ti-tan to remeber is Bill Yost, a verycourageous American W.W.II vet, who'sbook, 'Remember This Titan', jusat cameout. I have yet to read it, but did seeit @ Barnes & Noble here in the Ches.,VA area. The real story went somethinglike this. Bill Yost, the Defencive Co-ordinator, was passed over for an un-qualified Coach, younger Herman Boone,because Yost was white and Boone wasblack. Period. The movie, in which DenzelW. TURNS IN A FINE PERFORMANCE, doesn'tmention that Boone was fired three yearsafter the Titans won their first VA 'AAA'state Championship, for improprieties w/female staff in the offices of the HighSchool. Later T.C. Williams had a big drugscandal with Coach Glen Furman allowinghis players to get all doped up and thenlater claimed that he didn't know anythingabout it. More Hollywood 'Political Stupi-dity' at it's finest @ work here. Yes, it'snice white and black youths worked hard toget the school it's first title in Football,but it's bad Hollywood lied so much in thismovie and covered up the fact that Yost wasscrewed out of the top job there, that hedeserved!

They buy up martial arts classics such as ""Fist of Legend"", ""Drunken Master 2"" and ""Tai-Chi Master"", chop them up, repackage them, and parade them out like clockwork. Also, The Disney view of historical events isn't exactly accurate, to say the least. But finally, a Disney movie with some life to it... and it's one that doesn't have Miramax or Touchstone at the top of the credits.I loved this movie. That's right, I love a non-animated Disney movie, and I'm not ashamed to say it. For one, it had Denzel, and when Denzel is in a movie, my [price] movie ticket is bought and paid for. But it also dealt with a very human story, and a true one at that. A true story where the principal characters were all still alive, with the exception of one. No ""Pocahontas""-type artistic license here, and that was pleasing. The movie deals with the TC Williams High Titans, a high school football team in Alexandria, VA in the early 70's. The Titans were comprised of students from the newly integrated school district. The way they came together over those months up to and including the football season, inspired the entire city to change.I found that the actors were the greatest assets. They brought out their characters in a way that made you root for each one. You could see the conflicts in each and every movement they made. Every word they said. You could see the almost-obsessive drive in Denzel's Boone, as well as the compassion he had for his players. The conflict of Will Patton's Yoast, torn between doing the right thing and preserving his own legacy as a coach.I especially liked the evolution of the relationships between the players. They didn't just fall in with each other right away, it was a progression. It wasn't black being right, as proven by the character Julius' militant outlook. Nor was it about white being right, with Gary's hostility towards all not things not bleached out. It was about togetherness, and rising above differences. A very moving and uplifting movie. Sure, there was a heavy dose of schmaltz, but with it being a Disney movie, I wasn't caught off guard (EX: Denzel's last line. ""You're a hall of famer in my book."" Going by the way he delivered that line, you'd think he was tricked into saying it.). I'd recommend this movie to anyone going through a rough patch in life, or anyone feeling an excessive level of hate. Maybe this movie will show them that great things can still happen in this world. Hell, I won't even take a star off for producer Jerry Bruckheimer, and I excessively hate him.

What a pleasant suprise to find that Disney's live action movies are doing just the opposite.I approached ""Remember the Titans"" with a certain amount of criticism.  Knowing very little about it, I figured it would be another story of an underdog football team rising to glory.  I couldn't have been further off-base.  This movie is anything but a football movie, though football is one of the underlying foundations of the story.""Titans"" is a story about racial awareness, acceptance and understanding.  It is the telling of a ""true-life"" series of events surrounding a high school in West Virginia in the early 70's, and the blending of black and white in a school that was always racially segregated.  The football team, the ""Titans"", is the first to be affected by this change, when a long standing all-star coach is replaced by another coach (masterfully portrayed by Denzel Washington).  The white families turn from the idea that an African-American coach could possibly guide their children.As the story unfolds, we see children who were brought up in a racially biast environment setting their own prejudices aside and embracing their teammates.  The racial lines blur and the story serves as a reminder that, ultimately, it is not the color of skin that matters, but the size of the heart and the passion contained within that does.  These boys become men, transformed through the game of football, to support and care for one another despite their race.This movie serves as a reminder that we must look beyond our own prejudices and pre-conceived notions as to what is right and wrong, and instead try to accept, without prejudice, our fellow men and women as part of a greater race-the human one.A great movie for all ages, though some language and situations might be inappropriate for younger viewers.",5,"A Beautiful, Inspirational Film",1063152000,"09 10, 2003",2003,1944,"['recent', 'years', 'Disney', 'animation', 'save', 'CG', 'movies', 'Finding', 'Nemo', 'have', 'shown', 'huge', 'lapse', 'content', 'quality', 'What', 'pleasant', 'suprise', 'find', 'Disney', 'live', 'action', 'movies', 'are', 'doing', 'just', 'opposite.I', 'approached', 'Remember', 'Titans', 'certain', 'amount', 'criticism', 'Knowing', 'very', 'little', 'figured', 'would', 'be', 'story', 'underdog', 'football', 'team', 'rising', 'glory', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'further', 'off-base', 'movie', 'anything', 'football', 'movie', 'football', 'one', 'underlying', 'foundations', 'story', 'Titans', 'story', 'racial', 'awareness', 'acceptance', 'understanding', 'telling', 'true-life', 'series', 'events', 'surrounding', 'high', 'school', 'West', 'Virginia', 'early', '70', 'blending', 'black', 'white', 'school', 'was', 'always', 'racially', 'segregated', 'football', 'team', 'Titans', 'first', 'be', 'affected', 'change', 'when', 'long', 'standing', 'all-star', 'coach', 'replaced', 'coach', 'masterfully', 'portrayed', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'white', 'families', 'turn', 'idea', 'African-American', 'coach', 'could', 'possibly', 'guide', 'children.As', 'story', 'unfolds', 'see', 'children', 'who', 'were', 'brought', 'up', 'racially', 'biast', 'environment', 'setting', 'own', 'prejudices', 'aside', 'embracing', 'teammates', 'racial', 'lines', 'blur', 'story', 'reminder', 'ultimately', 'not', 'color', 'skin', 'matters', 'size', 'heart', 'passion', 'contained', 'become', 'men', 'transformed', 'game', 'football', 'support', 'care', 'one', 'race.This', 'movie', 'reminder', 'must', 'look', 'own', 'prejudices', 'pre-conceived', 'notions', 'what', 'right', 'wrong', 'instead', 'try', 'accept', 'prejudice', 'fellow', 'men', 'women', 'part', 'greater', 'race-the', 'human', 'one.A', 'great', 'movie', 'ages', 'language', 'situations', 'might', 'be', 'inappropriate', 'younger', 'viewers']",Remember the Titans VHS
571193,ANF5BP1SD3Z3O,B000056VP3,"Seven of Nine, Tertiary Adjunct of Unimatrix 01","[1, 3]","I liked this movie.  Finally a football film with some characters with depth that was not an orgiastic celebration of the game for uber fans.  Unlike the movie Rudy, there were issues other than football in the movie and there were Black characters (plural), not just one black janitor at Notre Dame a school not known for its racial tolerance off the field.Yes some characters were a little stereotypical but at least there was a range of Black and White characters in the movie.  It was nice to see Black kids who were intelligent and portrayed as typical teenagers.  Black teens I know, like my nieces, nephews and cousins, love to dance so I personally did not see this as a stereotype or portraying them as ""soul brothers"".  There was a White kid who was shown struggling with academics, this almost never happens in a movie, usually minority characters are portrayed as academic disasters.  Denzel portrayed Coach Boone as an inspiring leader.  Coach Yoast's character as written focused on someone who struggled to cope with racism internally and from his peers. And the actor made you see and understand his struggle and you felt for him.  His daughter Cheryl who loved football was a great portrayal, a girl who is not interested in dolls and her apperance is refreshing.When I see a movie that is ""based on a true story""  (based on my past experience researching movies that I love) I assume that 80% of the facts are probably wrong or dramatized to fit in with the director's/ studio's vision of what is bankable.For example  - the VonTrapp family in the sound of music was not really chased into the alps and forced to climb a mountain to cross into Switzerland.  They took a train to escape.  However quickly and calmly leaving on a train is not as dramatic as going to the abby and hiding from the nazi's taking the caretakers car into the mountains and walking throught the mountains to switzerland on foot with the nazi's at your heels.So believe it or not screenwriters take dramatic license with the stories of real people to tell a story that will sell because the idea is to make money.

Everyone I still know from Hammond loved the movie.We actually never thought much about segregation. People just went to the school that was nearest their homes, and Hammond was in the middle and upper middle class all white area of the city. Naturally everyone had great pride for their high school.. school spirit was encouraged at Hammond. Earlier I had lived in DC and went to the nearest public school at which I was the only white girl in my classes so I am familiar with desegregation... my mother went to the same school when it was all white.The chaos of making Hammond a 9th and 10th grade school would have upset any community, so it exacerbated the desegregation problem the city strove to achieve through court orders. Built in was a lot of resentment - Hammond was our neighborhood school with traditions, but there was no other way to integrate the races and even social classes of our city. I didn't go to school when the movie took place, but can you imagine giving up the pride and tradition of your school ... being transferred to a school that had been your rival - TC Williams in this case, even IF racial integration wasn't the reason?The movie does a good job of showing the anger people felt for the disruptions. This was our community high school. We were not southern. Most of the people I knew had parents who were related to the government in DC who had arrived after WWII from around the midwest and northeast - some parents had grown up in DC and were part of the ""white flight"". In that respect the movie makes it seem southern. NO! this was definitely not a southern culture school despite being in Virginia. Hardly anyone had a southern accent or would EVER say they were southern.All that aside, this movie is great because it epitomizes the problem of desegregation that much of the country went through. I believe the political landscape we are in today had its roots back then.As a military kid I had always gone to school with all the different races in our country... we took it in stride. I also went to several high schools so it's not too surprising the military kids in the movie were the most accommodating to the changes. Plus change was ingrained into us early. But much of the kids at Hammond had gone to grade school and junior high together. They must have been really upset to have their childhood dream of high school at Hammond dashed. This disappointment fanned the flames of resentment. It's all in the past now, but it is an educational experience to see it 40+ years later.I give this movie an A+ for the situation. (BTW everyone knew Coach Yoast. He was an extremely popular teacher/coach and a true professional educator.)",5,I went to Hammond,1374105600,"07 18, 2013",2013,2774,"['graduated', 'Hammond', 'High', 'school', 'Alexandria', ""'68"", '3', 'years', 'movie', 'Everyone', 'still', 'know', 'Hammond', 'loved', 'movie.We', 'actually', 'never', 'thought', 'much', 'segregation', 'People', 'just', 'went', 'school', 'was', 'nearest', 'homes', 'Hammond', 'was', 'middle', 'upper', 'middle', 'class', 'white', 'area', 'city', 'Naturally', 'everyone', 'had', 'great', 'pride', 'high', 'school..', 'school', 'spirit', 'was', 'encouraged', 'Hammond', 'Earlier', 'had', 'lived', 'DC', 'went', 'nearest', 'public', 'school', 'was', 'only', 'white', 'girl', 'classes', 'so', 'am', 'familiar', 'desegregation', 'mother', 'went', 'same', 'school', 'when', 'was', 'white.The', 'chaos', 'making', 'Hammond', '9th', '10th', 'grade', 'school', 'would', 'have', 'upset', 'community', 'exacerbated', 'desegregation', 'problem', 'city', 'strove', 'achieve', 'court', 'orders', 'Built', 'was', 'lot', 'resentment', 'Hammond', 'was', 'neighborhood', 'school', 'traditions', 'was', 'other', 'way', 'integrate', 'races', 'even', 'social', 'classes', 'city', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'school', 'when', 'movie', 'took', 'place', 'can', 'imagine', 'giving', 'up', 'pride', 'tradition', 'school', 'being', 'transferred', 'school', 'had', 'been', 'rival', 'TC', 'Williams', 'case', 'even', 'IF', 'racial', 'integration', 'was', ""n't"", 'reason', 'movie', 'good', 'job', 'showing', 'anger', 'people', 'felt', 'disruptions', 'was', 'community', 'high', 'school', 'were', 'not', 'southern', 'Most', 'people', 'knew', 'had', 'parents', 'who', 'were', 'related', 'government', 'DC', 'who', 'had', 'arrived', 'WWII', 'midwest', 'northeast', 'parents', 'had', 'grown', 'up', 'DC', 'were', 'part', 'white', 'flight', 'respect', 'movie', 'seem', 'southern', 'NO', 'was', 'definitely', 'not', 'southern', 'culture', 'school', 'being', 'Virginia', 'Hardly', 'anyone', 'had', 'southern', 'accent', 'would', 'EVER', 'say', 'were', 'southern.All', 'aside', 'movie', 'great', 'problem', 'desegregation', 'much', 'country', 'went', 'believe', 'political', 'landscape', 'are', 'today', 'had', 'roots', 'back', 'then.As', 'military', 'kid', 'had', 'always', 'gone', 'school', 'different', 'races', 'country', 'took', 'stride', 'also', 'went', 'several', 'high', 'schools', 'not', 'too', 'surprising', 'military', 'kids', 'movie', 'were', 'most', 'accommodating', 'changes', 'change', 'was', 'ingrained', 'early', 'much', 'kids', 'Hammond', 'had', 'gone', 'grade', 'school', 'junior', 'high', 'together', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'upset', 'have', 'childhood', 'dream', 'high', 'school', 'Hammond', 'dashed', 'disappointment', 'fanned', 'flames', 'resentment', 'past', 'now', 'educational', 'experience', 'see', '40+', 'years', 'later.I', 'give', 'movie', 'A+', 'situation', 'BTW', 'everyone', 'knew', 'Coach', 'Yoast', 'was', 'extremely', 'popular', 'teacher/coach', 'true', 'professional', 'educator']",Remember the Titans VHS

It was also a different film for Jerry Bruckheimer Films. It didn't have the exploding cars or planes, but it did have that unfaltering excitement and great storytelling that only Jerry Bruckheimer could bring to the screen as a producer.

Of course there are some distinctive similarities, but &quot;Titans&quot; is about much more than football.&quot;Remember the Titans&quot; tells the story of school busing in the early 1970s to achieve racial balance in urban schools. This was happening all over the country, so this film gives us a slice of life in a Virginia high school not uncommon to what was happening elsewhere. It's about overcoming stereotypes and prejudice and getting to know people of other races as individuals. It's about taking people from different cultural perspectives and bringing them together to make a cohesive team. It's really an encapsulation of the American story, one we often call a &quot;melting pot.&quot;This American story goes on. As I write, the Seattle Mariners have two star players from Japan. I'm sure the racial and cultural mix going on within that team is very interesting, although hopefully not as volatile as it was on the Titans. The point is, in our society, we are constantly being confronted with meeting, working, playing, or going to school with people who are from different backgrounds. &quot;Remember the Titans&quot; helps us remember the struggles we've gone through in the not-too-distant past, and it perhaps reminds us that we still have a long way to go.Another related film that is worthy of consideration is &quot;Finding Forrester,&quot; although the language is a bit rougher.",5,A powerful story about much more than football,990403200,"05 21, 2001",2001,1665,"['quot', 'Remember', 'Titans', 'quot', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'family', 'seen', 'past', 'year', 'just', 'watched', 'classic', 'basketball', 'film', 'quot', 'Hoosiers', 'quot', 'few', 'weeks', 'ago', 'was', 'expecting', 'quot', 'Titans', 'quot', 'be', 'football', 'version', 'same', 'story', 'course', 'are', 'distinctive', 'similarities', 'quot', 'Titans', 'quot', 'about', 'much', 'more', 'football.', 'quot', 'Remember', 'Titans', 'quot', 'story', 'school', 'busing', 'early', '1970s', 'achieve', 'racial', 'balance', 'urban', 'schools', 'was', 'happening', 'country', 'film', 'slice', 'life', 'Virginia', 'high', 'school', 'not', 'uncommon', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'elsewhere', 'overcoming', 'stereotypes', 'prejudice', 'getting', 'know', 'people', 'other', 'races', 'individuals', 'taking', 'people', 'different', 'cultural', 'perspectives', 'bringing', 'together', 'make', 'cohesive', 'team', 'really', 'encapsulation', 'American', 'story', 'one', 'often', 'call', 'quot', 'melting', 'pot.', 'quot', 'American', 'story', 'write', 'Seattle', 'Mariners', 'have', 'two', 'star', 'players', 'Japan', ""'m"", 'sure', 'racial', 'cultural', 'mix', 'going', 'team', 'very', 'interesting', 'hopefully', 'not', 'as', 'volatile', 'was', 'Titans', 'point', 'society', 'are', 'constantly', 'being', 'confronted', 'meeting', 'working', 'playing', 'going', 'school', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'different', 'backgrounds', 'quot', 'Remember', 'Titans', 'quot', 'remember', 'struggles', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'not-too-distant', 'past', 'perhaps', 'still', 'have', 'long', 'way', 'go.Another', 'related', 'film', 'worthy', 'consideration', 'quot', 'Finding', 'Forrester', 'quot', 'language', 'bit', 'rougher']",Remember the Titans VHS

571223,AP3B615GM191G,B000056VP3,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 0]","Sometimes, movies tend to be a bit out of balance when it comes to acting & story.  Either the actors overshadow a middling plot, or the plot is solid but the actors don't live up to the billing.  ""Remember The Titans"", however, provides the perfect blend of acting and story to create an incredible tapestry of emotion from beginning to end.For a basic plot summary, ""Remember The Titans"" is loosely based on the story of Virginia public school TC-Williams going through the integration process in the early 1970s.  When legendary white coach Bill Yoast (Will Patton) is replaced by black newcomer Herman Boone (Denzel Washington), the entire football program (and school in general) is thrown into the type of turmoil that integration would usually produce.  At first, All-American defenseman Gerry Bertier (Ryan Hurst) refuses to play with his new black teammates.  Helped along by the tenacity and shrewdness of Coach Boone, as well as a friendship with new player Julius Campbell (Wood Harris), Bertier and all his teammates face the choice of either coming together or having the whole program fall apart.Clearly, the deep racial themes in this film (quite similar to the more recently-produced ""The Help"") are what drive the primary emotions derived from it.  As a nation, integration is a topic that both embarrasses and inspires us...all at the same time.  This produces a cacophony of emotion that makes for dramatic viewing.  Director Boaz Yakin perfectly capitalizes on that emotionally potential by crafting an airtight script/story that never drags or stagnates.  Something is always happening (whether on the field or off it) that gives the viewer something significant to ponder.Only helping matters is the fact that this is one of the most well-casted films ever  created.  Washington is masterful as Coach Boone (the pivotal role in the film), but even he is matched by the performances of the surrounding cast.  Patton, Hurst, and Harris especially stand out, but are also joined by Donald Faison, Craig Kirkwood, Kip Pardue, Kate Bosworth, and Ryan Gosling.  A very young Hayden Panettiere even gets in on the acting greatness in a magnificent role.  By the end of the picture, you will feel as if you are right in the stands cheering on the Titans, as the characters will come so alive.Mention must also be given to the musical score, a combination of period pieces (a locker room rendition of ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"" is a treat) and incredible orchestration from Trevor Rabin.  An emotional film like this needed a great soundtrack, and it sure does deliver.Overall, ""Remember The Titans"" is one of my favorite movies of all-time for its mixing of drama, comedy, historic themes, music, and characters that will absolutely come alive.  I don't see how anyone can sit down and watch this masterpiece and not enjoy it.",5,Superb Blending Of Acting & Story,1345939200,"08 26, 2012",2012,2846,"['Sometimes', 'movies', 'tend', 'be', 'bit', 'balance', 'when', 'acting', 'story', 'actors', 'overshadow', 'middling', 'plot', 'plot', 'solid', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'billing', 'Remember', 'Titans', 'however', 'perfect', 'blend', 'acting', 'story', 'create', 'incredible', 'tapestry', 'emotion', 'beginning', 'end.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Remember', 'Titans', 'loosely', 'based', 'story', 'Virginia', 'public', 'school', 'TC-Williams', 'going', 'integration', 'process', 'early', '1970s', 'When', 'legendary', 'white', 'coach', 'Bill', 'Yoast', 'Will', 'Patton', 'replaced', 'black', 'newcomer', 'Herman', 'Boone', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'entire', 'football', 'program', 'school', 'general', 'thrown', 'type', 'turmoil', 'integration', 'would', 'usually', 'produce', 'first', 'All-American', 'defenseman', 'Gerry', 'Bertier', 'Ryan', 'Hurst', 'play', 'new', 'black', 'teammates', 'Helped', 'tenacity', 'shrewdness', 'Coach', 'Boone', 'as', 'well', 'friendship', 'new', 'player', 'Julius', 'Campbell', 'Wood', 'Harris', 'Bertier', 'teammates', 'face', 'choice', 'coming', 'together', 'having', 'whole', 'program', 'fall', 'apart.Clearly', 'deep', 'racial', 'themes', 'film', 'quite', 'similar', 'more', 'recently-produced', 'Help', 'are', 'what', 'drive', 'primary', 'emotions', 'derived', 'nation', 'integration', 'topic', 'embarrasses', 'inspires', 'same', 'time', 'cacophony', 'emotion', 'dramatic', 'viewing', 'Director', 'Boaz', 'Yakin', 'perfectly', 'emotionally', 'potential', 'crafting', 'airtight', 'script/story', 'never', 'stagnates', 'Something', 'always', 'happening', 'field', 'viewer', 'something', 'significant', 'ponder.Only', 'helping', 'matters', 'fact', 'one', 'most', 'well-casted', 'films', 'ever', 'created', 'Washington', 'masterful', 'Coach', 'Boone', 'pivotal', 'role', 'film', 'even', 'matched', 'performances', 'surrounding', 'cast', 'Patton', 'Hurst', 'Harris', 'especially', 'stand', 'out', 'are', 'also', 'joined', 'Donald', 'Faison', 'Craig', 'Kirkwood', 'Kip', 'Pardue', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'very', 'young', 'Hayden', 'Panettiere', 'even', 'acting', 'greatness', 'magnificent', 'role', 'end', 'picture', 'will', 'feel', 'are', 'right', 'stands', 'cheering', 'Titans', 'characters', 'will', 'come', 'so', 'alive.Mention', 'must', 'also', 'be', 'given', 'musical', 'score', 'combination', 'period', 'pieces', 'locker', 'room', 'rendition', 'Ai', ""n't"", 'No', 'Mountain', 'High', 'Enough', 'treat', 'incredible', 'orchestration', 'Trevor', 'Rabin', 'emotional', 'film', 'needed', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'sure', 'deliver.Overall', 'Remember', 'Titans', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'all-time', 'mixing', 'drama', 'comedy', 'historic', 'themes', 'music', 'characters', 'will', 'absolutely', 'come', 'alive', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'anyone', 'can', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'masterpiece', 'not', 'enjoy']",Remember the Titans VHS

What I like about it, is that it did not just focus on one perspective, it shows both sides.The film is about a (all-white) football team, that gets a new football coach (Washington) Due to the towns segregation of African-Americans. Without giving away any spoilers, the film is about Coach Boone trying to get both Blacks and Whites to play together on the same field, and respect each other off the field.Overall, ""Remember the Titans"" is a good movie that deals with segregation and team-work.",3,Denzel gives a great performance,1275264000,"05 31, 2010",2010,558,"['Remember', 'Titans', 'film', 'segregation', 'What', 'like', 'did', 'not', 'just', 'focus', 'one', 'perspective', 'sides.The', 'film', 'all-white', 'football', 'team', 'new', 'football', 'coach', 'Washington', 'Due', 'towns', 'segregation', 'African-Americans', 'giving', 'away', 'spoilers', 'film', 'Coach', 'Boone', 'trying', 'get', 'Blacks', 'Whites', 'play', 'together', 'same', 'field', 'respect', 'other', 'field.Overall', 'Remember', 'Titans', 'good', 'movie', 'deals', 'segregation', 'team-work']",Remember the Titans VHS
