However, CRACKER is where he captured most of us as fans, well in advance of his Harry Potter role as Hagrid.  Coltrane plays Fitz, a psychologist who helps the police solve murder cases. This was well before the Dr. Tony Hill shows. Where Tony Hill is eccentric and tends to live in his own world, Fitz lives large in the real world indulging just about every vice there is.  He's loud, obnoxious, a gambler, a drinker, a smoker.  His wife leaves him because of the gambling only to start having an affair with her psychiatrist. Fitz has two teenagers who he off and on parents.  In short, he's a total mess in his own life which makes him utterly believable as a psychologist.  He is also an instructor at the university level, just like Tony Hill is.  Fitz is not really a profiler though.  He doesn't work in generalities which is what a profiler does in making a capsule summary of who the killer is likely to be.  No, Fitz goes banging around getting in everyone's face to solve his cases.  When he interrogates someone, it is psychologically brutal.The cases themselves are very good.  We open with a serial murder.  The chief suspect is an amnesiac who is found in a field near the railroad tracks covered in blood.  All the young women have been murdered on trains.  As Fitz tries to tear the suspect down, things no one else notices begin to bother him.  Such as he spots the man has never worn a watch in his life. He makes none of the motions a person who has worn a watch makes plus he has no watch line on his wrist.  How does someone who is using train timetables to murder women get by with never wearing a watch?I've seen all of the episodes.  The very last ones were not as good as the early ones but every show begins petering out after awhile.

He goes to the point where he mortgages the house by forging his wife's name on the bank documents.  He lays around the house, usually nursing a hang-over from the next day.

The character of Fitz (Cracker) becomes less believable as the episodes progress - how someone who is on the verge of alcoholism can analyse his clients so remarkably clearly is an issue for me. Also towards the end there is a sudden change of actors - first we are in Hong Kong with no real explanation in the penultimate episode and in the final one his wife and son are played by different actors as are the police people - and the story is weak so that the ending is pure anti-climax.

1207210,A1FY6ETS4ZPCUE,B001JXPC4Q,Mr. Mambo,"[3, 3]","This is a great series, for many, many reasons. I love the fact that the name of the show is ""Cracker"" which is NOT the actual name of the lead character. This is something that would likely not happen in American TV; producers would be afraid of confusing the average viewer, who, in the minds of those who control American TV, is at the mental level of a ten-year old. Another thing which you'd never see in US shows is a leading man who would be morbidly obese. So wonderfully refreshing, mercurial, contrary, rebellious, iconoclastic! All character traits of Edward Fitzgerald, by the way. He is totally dedicated to a plethora of addictions: smokes cigs constantly, puts away about a quart of booze a day, is a degenerate gambler, yet never once do you hear him say anything about giving any of them up. His marriage of twenty years is hanging by a thread, he's alienated his two kids, his work life is a shambles.Yet, unlike the police, he is a brilliantly insightful psychologist who seems to be able to sniff out perpetrators within five minutes of meeting them. He goes on intuition, hunches, and bold but very educated guesswork to crack difficult cases. Each episode contains at least one great scene of Fitz, in the interview room, usually seen though a cloud of smoke, having a little chat with a suspect. He masterfully employs various methods to extract the truth: anger, bullying, insinuation, irony, sarcasm, trickery, he'll stop at nothing. Quite often he reduces the poor blighters to tears. Scottish actor Robbie Coltrane is simply amazing in the lead. There are a host of great Irish, English and Scottish actors appearing as cops, victims and criminals. Watch for the gruff, grizzled, overweight, working-class, bespectacled Ricky Tomlinson, outstanding in many of Ken Loach's films, as the top cop in the middle episodes. Irish actor Lorcan Cranaich is great as a visceral and reactive cop who's constantly butting heads with Fitz. Geraldine Sommerville is very good as the sweetly pretty young police inspector Penheligan, who can't help but be attracted to the larger-than-life Fitzgerald.Yes, we are asked to believe that a beautiful, fit 30-year old female cop would fall in love with a 50-ish, fat, loudmouth boor who smokes and drinks and gambles. Go figure! Somehow it works!Any criticism I'd have would be that the cops always seem to be forgetting just how sharp Fitz is. Seems like they are always celebrating a premature arrest as a ""case closed"", toasting one another over a few pints, and do not handle it well when Fitz tells them they have the wrong man. They react with jokes and jeers and, with Cranaich's character particularly, open hostility. Then Fitz ferrets out the true criminal and they all have to eat crow. In real life, if a guy was a good as Fitz, he'd be the first person the ""old Bill"" would ring, and they'd be fawning all over him.I wouldn't pay full price for this from Acorn.

Robbie Coltrane does a great job as hired gun psychologist for the police, Dr. Fitzgerald ""Fitz"".He makes the character believable and appealing through his strengths as a intuitive psychologist, who appears to be fed almost as much by his flaws in character as his skills as trained psychologist. The fact that the driving factors of the challenges in his own personal mental anguishes is never addressed adds to interest in the character as you try to find out why he is what he is through observing the examples of his symptoms (drinking, gambling etc).The stories are very strong and so are the other police persons cast in the series. If you know a little about police procedure, it is as with most series, important that you suspend a sense of disbelieve, however it is made easier by the great dialogue, story line and strong charaters of all those who act.

1207214,A3QCKEKIIQ4J2W,B001JXPC4Q,"RIJU GANGULY ""perceptive reader""","[7, 7]","Let me clarify certain things at the very outset:1) This is NOT a POLICE PROCEDURAL, neither is it a series involving the events & emotions that someone in the line of fire has to go through in the process of nabbing the bad guys and helping the good guys.2) This is NOT a series where one sees the protagonist evolve into someone better; the protagonist here (Dr. Fitzerald, a brilliant but pathologically unlovable psychologist) remains the same nasty, caustic, egoistic, self-centered, gambling, hurting genius who can see through the criminal minds, but can not feel the torture that his nearest & beloved are going through.Now that I have managed to write that stuff out (a ""catharsis""?), I can write what this series are:1. The stories (esp. the first couple, and a few in the middle, except ""Best Boys"") are gripping.2. Relationship between Fitz and Penhaligon (a beautiful Police Officer) and Fitz & his wife, and the literally cracking tension that is felt in the scenes involving them would put any soap-opera to shame any day, and yet would remain dark & grim, since there is usually a murder or rape at the backdrop of this drama.3. Some of the subject matters, like the gradual descent of an old-styled copper into someone truly bad simply because he had failed to prevent something that he could have done, the social tension, impacts of war & terrorism devastating the matrix of human mind, are visceral and very-very grim, making viewing of this series an uncomfortable, yet compulsory task.Thus, I rest the case. If you appreciate a good drama with top-notch acting from all, watch this series. If you are looking for something more realistic and yet with a dark hue, I would recommendPrime Suspect: The Complete Collection, after you have watched this series because it is still superior to most other stuff flooding our TV-s now.",4,"In a drama, darkly..!",1312070400,"07 31, 2011",2011,1848,"['Let', 'clarify', 'certain', 'things', 'very', 'outset:1', 'NOT', 'POLICE', 'PROCEDURAL', 'series', 'involving', 'events', 'emotions', 'someone', 'line', 'fire', 'go', 'process', 'nabbing', 'bad', 'guys', 'helping', 'good', 'guys.2', 'NOT', 'series', 'where', 'one', 'protagonist', 'evolve', 'someone', 'better', 'protagonist', 'here', 'Dr.', 'Fitzerald', 'brilliant', 'pathologically', 'unlovable', 'psychologist', 'same', 'nasty', 'caustic', 'egoistic', 'self-centered', 'gambling', 'hurting', 'genius', 'who', 'can', 'see', 'criminal', 'minds', 'can', 'not', 'feel', 'torture', 'nearest', 'beloved', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'managed', 'write', 'stuff', 'out', 'catharsis', 'can', 'write', 'what', 'series', 'are:1', 'stories', 'esp', 'first', 'couple', 'few', 'middle', 'Best', 'Boys', 'are', 'gripping.2', 'Relationship', 'Fitz', 'Penhaligon', 'beautiful', 'Police', 'Officer', 'Fitz', 'wife', 'literally', 'cracking', 'tension', 'felt', 'scenes', 'involving', 'would', 'put', 'soap-opera', 'shame', 'day', 'yet', 'would', 'remain', 'dark', 'grim', 'usually', 'murder', 'rape', 'backdrop', 'drama.3', 'subject', 'matters', 'gradual', 'descent', 'old-styled', 'copper', 'someone', 'truly', 'bad', 'simply', 'had', 'failed', 'prevent', 'something', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'social', 'tension', 'impacts', 'war', 'terrorism', 'devastating', 'matrix', 'human', 'mind', 'are', 'visceral', 'very-very', 'grim', 'making', 'viewing', 'series', 'uncomfortable', 'yet', 'compulsory', 'task.Thus', 'rest', 'case', 'appreciate', 'good', 'drama', 'top-notch', 'acting', 'watch', 'series', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'more', 'realistic', 'yet', 'dark', 'hue', 'would', 'recommendPrime', 'Suspect', 'Complete', 'Collection', 'have', 'watched', 'series', 'still', 'superior', 'most', 'other', 'stuff', 'flooding', 'TV-s', 'now']",CRACKER: THE COMPLETE COLLECTION

1207219,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B001JXPC4Q,Stephanie De Pue,"[78, 79]","""Cracker: The Complete Collection,"" is our first opportunity to acquire all eleven of the riveting mysteries in the highly-praised British television series of crime dramas. It comes as a deluxe set of ten disks that includes all three series of the long-running British mystery (1993-95), two standalone TV movies, and a 45-minute behind-the-scenes retrospective documentary.  It runs approximately 22  hours all told, and also includes, thank goodness, and thank you Acorn Media Group, subtitles for each episode: it would, otherwise, be rather difficult for us on this side of the pond to make out the Manchester accent, as that handsome, ethnically diverse northern English city is where the series was largely filmed, and the actors encouraged to utilize its hard-on-the-ears accent.  The series has shown here on the A & E network, and on BBC America: it was made by Granada for broadcast over the independent TV stations (ITV) in the United Kingdom.Jimmy McGovern (The Street), a hugely talented writer who has traveled far on, and from, his Celtic working class Liverpool origins, created the series and wrote several of the strongest episodes.  The series stars the very large Scottish Robbie Coltrane, who took his stage name in homage to the American jazzman John Coltrane; he was better-known at that time as a comic actor (Nuns on the Run, I believe, is where I first saw him, playing with Eric  Idle).  Coltrane made the role of Cracker, Edward Fitzgerald, a brilliant but deeply flawed forensic psychologist, who frequently worked with the police, his own; and his extraordinary work in it made him famous.  He has gone on to play inOcean's Twelve,GoldenEye, and as Hagrid in the Harry Potter films.  Coltrane is volcanic in ""Cracker,"" and there are those who will say, like ""The Philadelphia Inquirer,"" that it is his greatest role.Mind you, Coltrane plays Fitz as an abrasive, egocentric man, addicted to alcohol, cigarettes and gambling: the character drinks a bottle of scotch a day; smokes 50-60 cigarettes, and keeps his family in constant financial turmoil with his gambling.  Coltrane is backed in this series by an excellent supporting cast: Christopher Eccleston (Heroes, Doctor Who), as DCI David Bilborough; Geraldine Somerville (Harry Potter series), as DS Jane Penhaligan; and Barbara Flynn (The Beiderbecke Affair), as Fitz's long-suffering wife, Judith.In addition, the producers have gone out and hired some of the best actors around - and a lot of Celts-- for guest star spots.  The often-seen Irish actors Adrian Dunbar, and Susan Lynch each carry an episode, he as Kelly in the first, ""The Madwoman in the Attic,"" a story of railway murders based on a real murder that took place in a train en route to London in the early 90s.  She, Lynch, carries the second episode, ""To Say I Love You,"" as Tina; both are powerful performers in powerful stories.  The veteran, well-known character actress Beryl Reid also shows up in this second episode, as Fitz's horse-playing mother.  The intense Scottish actor Robert Carlyle (The Full Monty - Fully Exposed Edition), as Albie, a skinhead, carries the fourth episode ""To Be a Somebody,"" so well, people are still talking about it.  The almost-equally intense English actress Samantha Morton carries the fifth episode, one written by Ted Whitehead rather than McGovern, ""The Big Crunch,"" as a teenage schoolgirl too nave for her own good. The lovely Fleur Bennett carries the ninth, ""True Romance,"" as an achingly vulnerable young woman: she too, I believe, started in comedy, or at any rate I saw her first as Mavis Moulterd, country-girl/straight-woman to John Inman's Mr. Humphries in the early 90'sAre You Being Served? Again! (The Complete Series)McGovern's scripts are tight, cunning, and fast, no leisurely British exposition here, and capable of continual surprises.  Whitehead's are very good, but not quite.  Paul Abbot's scripts are fine, but not in the same stratosphere.  In Abbot's 9th episode, ""True Romance,"" we suddenly get a left-wing; anti-Thatcher outburst of the sort that could quite ruin McGovern's final script included here, the 2006 standalone, ""A New Terror,"" for a lot of people.  There is also a 1996 standalone, ""The White Ghost,"" nice script by Abbot, set in that fascinating and beautiful, tropical, oriental and British city, Hong Kong, in that fraught time shortly before its July 1st, 1997 handover to the Chinese.Granada certainly didn't stint on this series; it's lavishly filmed, with plenty of cars and people in the urban streets, auditoriums and nightclubs full of students.  Direction was excellent, from Antonia Bird and Michael Winterbottom, among others. The music, from a number of talented men, also adds to the mood.  The Hong Kong mystery really gives you an eyeful of that great city.  The series won more than 25 major awards, including two BAFTAs for best drama series, and three for best actor for Coltrane.  Many critics, including one at ""The Boston Globe"" consider it the best made-for-TV-mystery or cop series.  And me?  I won't lie to you: I have always loved this series.",5,I Have Always Loved This Series,1237248000,"03 17, 2009",2009,5104,"['Cracker', 'Complete', 'Collection', 'first', 'opportunity', 'acquire',
