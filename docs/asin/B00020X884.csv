They are all my favorite actors (except Tony Curtis) in one movie. Ok for a dollar I bought the movie. Watched and then put it in the give away pile. I have lots of public domain, black and white, full screen, blurry prints that I find more enjoyable to watch. A good study in how a great cast can be wasted. Tony Curtis roll in the movie (script fault) drug it down more. Hy Averback, the director has been great in  hour TV shows but doesn't seem to know what to do with a 1 hour movie. Tank, with James Garner, same type plot, is much better although not a comedy, it has it light moments. MGM has to have better movies to release. Oh yes. That's right, they did with their Midnight Movies series.",2,"Love the cast, disliked the plot.",1245888000,"06 25, 2009",2009,794,"['2', 'stars', 'one', 'laugh', 'Read', 'reviews', 'how', 'could', 'cast', 'make', 'movie', 'bad', 'are', 'favorite', 'actors', 'Tony', 'Curtis', 'one', 'movie', 'Ok', 'dollar', 'bought', 'movie', 'Watched', 'then', 'put', 'give', 'away', 'have', 'lots', 'public', 'domain', 'black', 'white', 'full', 'screen', 'blurry', 'prints', 'find', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'good', 'study', 'how', 'great', 'cast', 'can', 'be', 'wasted', 'Tony', 'Curtis', 'roll', 'movie', 'script', 'fault', 'drug', 'down', 'more', 'Hy', 'Averback', 'director', 'been', 'great', 'hour', 'TV', 'shows', ""n't"", 'seem', 'know', 'what', 'do', '1', 'hour', 'movie', 'Tank', 'James', 'Garner', 'same', 'type', 'plot', 'much', 'better', 'not', 'comedy', 'light', 'moments', 'MGM', 'have', 'better', 'movies', 'release', 'Oh', 'yes', 'right', 'did', 'Midnight', 'Movies', 'series']",Suppose They Gave a War and Nobody Came?
