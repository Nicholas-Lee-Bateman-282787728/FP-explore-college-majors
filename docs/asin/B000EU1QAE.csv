978997,A19EKT8H85AKO5,B000EU1QAE,BigStory,"[0, 0]","This is a 3 DVD-set featuring the legendary performer known as Dusty Rhodes. Each disc is presented with a fair amount of matches as well as interview segments and skits. Disc 1 features the documentary. One error I noticed on the first disc is an interview conducted by Vince where it is labeled as being from Madison Square Garden. This interview was actually from the TV program All-Star Wrestling where Vince interviews Rhodes in front of the ring.Aside from being a great set on Dusty himself, this program is also a nice time capsule on pro wrestling throughout the 70's, 80's, and some parts of the 90's. I was glad to see the complete ring entrance of The Nature Boy in his match with Rhodes at the Great American Bash. One funny moment I noticed was a botched move by Virgil. When Dustin's clothesline didn't knock Virgil over the ropes, Virgil just seem knock himself over the ropes. Even Jimmy Hart, who was on commentary, made a joke out of it.Another thing I was glad to see was that the old WWF logos were not digitally covered. Not a big deal I suppose, but still a bit annoying when it happens. Of course the one obvious bad thing is the removal of Jesse Ventura's commentary. Ventura was almost always entertaining on commentary. Otherwise it was a pleasure to see all the old segments from Mid-Atlantic, World Wide, and NWA World Championship Wrestling. Overall just a great and historic set on Dusty and pro wrestling itself.",5,Son of a plumber-man,1250294400,"08 15, 2009",2009,1444,"['3', 'DVD-set', 'featuring', 'legendary', 'performer', 'known', 'Dusty', 'Rhodes', 'disc', 'presented', 'fair', 'amount', 'matches', 'as', 'well', 'interview', 'segments', 'skits', 'Disc', '1', 'documentary', 'One', 'error', 'noticed', 'first', 'disc', 'interview', 'conducted', 'Vince', 'where', 'labeled', 'being', 'Madison', 'Square', 'Garden', 'interview', 'was', 'actually', 'TV', 'program', 'All-Star', 'Wrestling', 'where', 'Vince', 'Rhodes', 'front', 'ring.Aside', 'being', 'great', 'set', 'Dusty', 'program', 'also', 'nice', 'time', 'capsule', 'pro', 'wrestling', '70', '80', 'parts', '90', 'was', 'glad', 'see', 'complete', 'ring', 'entrance', 'Nature', 'Boy', 'match', 'Rhodes', 'Great', 'American', 'Bash', 'One', 'funny', 'moment', 'noticed', 'was', 'botched', 'move', 'Virgil', 'When', 'Dustin', 'clothesline', 'did', ""n't"", 'knock', 'Virgil', 'ropes', 'Virgil', 'just', 'seem', 'knock', 'ropes', 'Even', 'Jimmy', 'Hart', 'who', 'was', 'commentary', 'made', 'joke', 'it.Another', 'thing', 'was', 'glad', 'see', 'was', 'old', 'WWF', 'logos', 'were', 'not', 'digitally', 'covered', 'Not', 'big', 'deal', 'suppose', 'still', 'bit', 'annoying', 'when', 'course', 'one', 'obvious', 'bad', 'thing', 'removal', 'Jesse', 'Ventura', 'commentary', 'Ventura', 'was', 'almost', 'always', 'entertaining', 'commentary', 'Otherwise', 'was', 'pleasure', 'see', 'old', 'segments', 'Mid-Atlantic', 'World', 'Wide', 'NWA', 'World', 'Championship', 'Wrestling', 'Overall', 'just', 'great', 'historic', 'set', 'Dusty', 'pro', 'wrestling']",N/A
978998,A18CEASUWUTJ1J,B000EU1QAE,Bob Millwood,"[1, 26]","I'm not too sure about why the WWE is making a dvd on Dusty Rhodes I mean in my opinion his son Dustin probably did more for the business then he did.  Of course I have only seen a few of Dusty matches and these matches basically dealt with his rivalry with Ted Dibase, a man they should do a dvd on, and Terry Funk.  But I guess since he is a World Champion several times over and had such long standing rivalries with Ric Flair and other wrestlers it makes him deserving.  I would rather they make a dvd on someone like Ricky Steamboat, Ted Dibase, Owen Hart, and Snuuka.  I mean none of these men didn't win a world title but in their own way they contributed a great deal to the history of Professional Wrestling.",3,I'm Not too sure,1144454400,"04 8, 2006",2006,717,"[""'m"", 'not', 'too', 'sure', 'why', 'WWE', 'making', 'dvd', 'Dusty', 'Rhodes', 'mean', 'opinion', 'son', 'Dustin', 'probably', 'did', 'more', 'business', 'then', 'did', 'course', 'have', 'only', 'seen', 'few', 'Dusty', 'matches', 'matches', 'basically', 'dealt', 'rivalry', 'Ted', 'Dibase', 'man', 'should', 'do', 'dvd', 'Terry', 'Funk', 'guess', 'World', 'Champion', 'several', 'times', 'had', 'such', 'long', 'standing', 'rivalries', 'Ric', 'Flair', 'other', 'wrestlers', 'deserving', 'would', 'rather', 'make', 'dvd', 'someone', 'Ricky', 'Steamboat', 'Ted', 'Dibase', 'Owen', 'Hart', 'Snuuka', 'mean', 'none', 'men', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'world', 'title', 'own', 'way', 'contributed', 'great', 'deal', 'history', 'Professional', 'Wrestling']",N/A

The sound button on the cover is a nice touch.The documentary really isn't all that bad. You can fully understand the impact that Rhodes had on the business.  I did not know that it was his idea to give Ron Simmons the WCW World title, making Simmons the first African-American to win a world singles title.The matches are also very well selected.But what makes this DVD really special are the HUGE selections of promos and vignettes.  Dusty was truly a master of the interview and although I have a few of these in my own tape collection, seeing the large sampling of promos throughout his career made this DVD worth buying!",5,The Promos Are Worth the Price of Admission!,1150329600,"06 15, 2006",2006,753,"['DVD', 'American', 'Dream-The', 'Dusty', 'Rhodes', 'Story', 'very', 'nice', 'DVD', 'one', 'nicest-looking', 'packages', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'sound', 'button', 'cover', 'nice', 'touch.The', 'documentary', 'really', ""n't"", 'bad', 'can', 'fully', 'understand', 'impact', 'Rhodes', 'had', 'business', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'was', 'idea', 'give', 'Ron', 'Simmons', 'WCW', 'World', 'title', 'making', 'Simmons', 'first', 'African-American', 'win', 'world', 'title.The', 'matches', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'well', 'selected.But', 'what', 'DVD', 'really', 'special', 'are', 'HUGE', 'selections', 'promos', 'vignettes', 'Dusty', 'was', 'truly', 'master', 'interview', 'have', 'few', 'own', 'tape', 'collection', 'seeing', 'large', 'sampling', 'promos', 'career', 'made', 'DVD', 'worth', 'buying']",N/A
979000,AZ2YLC0GWTAH2,B000EU1QAE,D.P.,"[7, 7]","""The American Dream"" Dusty Rhodes is a bonified legend in this business. Dusty Rhodes was one of the men back in the early stages of wrestling (late 70's/early 80's) who was able to have a crossover appeal with fans that rarely anybody could touch. He trancended racial barriers & was accepted by all because the fans could legitly feel like he was one of them. You can call him ""The Common Man"" or even ""Mr. Soul"" but he was truely The American Dream.The docuementry kicks off talking about him being a son of a plumber and overcoming obsticales as a kid before going into college & breaking into the business. His heel run with Dick Murdock as part of the Texas Outlaws was talked about including how they were out of control in & outside the ring and what led to Dusty breaking off from the team. His transformation into the American Dream & what his role was within Flordia Championship Wrestling was talked about next with comments from Mike Graham as well. His first run in the WWF was based about his fued with ""Superstar"" Billy Graham and his three matches in MSG with Graham are discussed. Dusty becoming the NWA Champion, his heavy road schedule, and his unbelievable promos & catchphrases are talked about leading up to his fued with Ric Flair leading up to their famous Great American Bash cage match in which Dusty won the title. Dusty's reign as booker in WCW and how he gets a bad rap for some of the things he's done (the Robocop angle, the ""Dusty Finish"" full of run-in's & false finishes) along with some of the positives (Ron Simmons becoming the first African American World Champion & his ideas for PPV's such as Great American Bash, Starrcade, and Halloweed Havoc) are profiled along with how it ended up coming to an end. Dusty's entrance in to the WWE as ""The Common Man"" is heavily discussed from all the promos ranging from the pizza man to the gas man to the meat man, his manager Sapphire, and his ""polka dots."" The storyline involving Ted Dibiase & how that led to Dustin Rhodes coming into the WWE & teaming with Dusty is a big story in this documentry as they also talk about their seperation & eventual reunion along with the story of how Dustin had to become Goldust to escape his father's shadow round out this documentry on Dusty's career. A real negative I would concider here is how they left out Dusty's long run in WCW as an announcer along with his short run in ECW as he was over & universally accepted by the ECW fans (WHICH IS VERY HARD TO BE) just based on his legendary status in the industry.This DVD set includes 47 Dusty Rhodes promos spanning from Flordia Championship Wrestling, NWA Mid-Altantic & Georgia Championship Wrestling, and the WWE. Some of these promos include interviews from his first WWE run in '77, from his fued with Ric Flair in '85/'86, all of the promos from his Tully Blanchard/Baby Doll storyline, and all the Common Man promos leading up to his second run in the WWE. There is also an inteview featuring Dustin Rhodes & Terri from '97 talking about his character Goldust & his relationship with Dustry. Also here are two hidden easter eggs talking about Mike Graham's first encounter with the Texas Outlaws and Ted Dibiase telling the story behind how his bodyguard Virgil got his name from Dusty.Matches Include:vs. WWWF Champion Billy Graham - This was the beginning of a series of battles between two of the most charismatic wrestlers at that time.  Dusty just knew knew how to work the crowd and had them hot for every single thing he did while Graham tried to ground Dusty with headlocks & bear hugs.  This was a good start to a classic series.""MSG"" Sept. '77Bullrope Match vs. Billy Graham - This was similar to their first encounter except that this was very violent for it's day as both men used the cowbell on the bullrop various times & were heavily bleeding to the point where Chief Jay Strongbow, the special referee for the match, had a white shirt that was covered in blood.""MSG"" Aug. '78vs. NWA Champion Harley Race - This was a rare occurance as the NWA Championship was defended in Madison Square Garden.  Dusty heavily worked on Harley's neck with various headlocks & even wrenching a half-nelson on the mat at one while while Harley lived up to his reputation as one of the toughest men in the business as he had Dusty heavily bleeding.""MSG"" Dec. '79Steel Cage Match vs. NWA Television Champion Tully Blanchard - This match had a special stipulation in that if Dusty won, he not only won the Television Championship but also won the services of Tully Blanchard's valet, Baby Doll.  This was your typical cage match in that both men were brawling & bleeding while grinding their heads into the steel cage.NWA Great American Bash '85Steel Cage Match vs. NWA Champion Ric Flair - This was very similar to the previous cage match in that it was very competitive match between both men with both heavily bleeding & using the cage as a weapon various times against each other before Dusty walked away with this final NWA World Heavyweight Championship.  The real bonus here is the commentary with Dusty along with Mike Graham on this match.NWA Great American Bash '86Steel Cage Match vs. NWA United States Champion Lex Luger - Wow, don't recall another superstar having this many steel cage matches on their set.  This one was for the United States Championship with the stipulation that Dusty was going ot be suspended for 90 days if he lost and they had Johnny Weaver at ringside as the gatekeeper.  Dusty worked a different offense than usual as he kept going to sleeperholds throughout the match including the ""Weaver-lock"" that Johnny Weaver made famous while grinding on Luger's arm to take away the Torture Rack.  Luger also worked over Dusty's arm & used his power along with the used the cage to bust Dusty open.  The ending would not only result in Dusty gaining the United States Championship but also mark the beginning of the end of Luger's membership in the Four Horsemen.NWA Starrcade '87Barbed Wire Match w/Road Warriors vs. Ivan Koloff & Powers Of Pain - This wasn't a ""no ropes"" barbed wire match that we're used to seeing in this day & age as they had one thin string of barbed wire wrapped up across all three ropes together so it looks very ""tame"" by today's standards but hardcore for that day & age. This was pretty short & sweet as the Warriors & Dusty (complete with his own Road Warrior facepaint) got dominated & got their revenge for the eye injury Animal suffered which forced him to wear a hockey mask in this match.""NWA Clash Of The Champions"" Mar. '88NWA United States Championship Match vs. Ivan Koloff - With the exception of some interference from Paul Jones & cheating from Ivan such as choking & using his chain, this was a dominate Dusty from start to finish.""NWA Main Event"" Apr. '88w/Sting vs. NWA Tag Team Champions Arn Anderson & Tully Blanchard - This was a classic ""faces vs. heels"" encounter as Sting & Rhodes kept getting the upperhand & dominating the Horsemen resulting in Anderson & Blanchard resorting to double teams & illegal tactics with J.J. Dillion at ringside and even Sting on the recieving end of a DDT on the floor.  This was a back & forth match with the crowd hot from start to finish but this match did it's job in establishing matches & feuds going into the ""Great American Bash"" PPV the next month.""NWA Clash Of The Champions"" June '88w/Sting vs. NWA Tag Team Champions Road Warriors - This was during the Road Warriors' heel run which didn't get over well concidering how the fans were still cheering for the Warriors as well as Dusty & Sting. It was a good match but nothing really special or memorable.NWA Starrcade '88(""Starrcade: The Essental Collection"")vs. Honky Tonk Man - This was Dusty's WWE PPV debut...decked in yellow polka dots.  This was very entertaining in the beginning but moved into a normal wrestling match with Honky on the offense for most of the match before Dusty made his victorious comeback.SummerSlam '89Elimination Match w/Brutus Beefcake, Tito Santana, Red Rooster vs. Big Boss Man, Bad News Brown, Honky Tonk Man, Rick Martel - There were no real highlights in this match although it was just solid from beginning to end.Survivor Series '89w/Sapphire vs. Randy Savage & Sherri - We all know how great of a inring workhouse Randy Savage was throughout his career but this match was more about showcasing his ""entertaining side"" as this was one of those matches that if you took it for what it was, you'll enjoy it. This was a fun mixed tag match with some very comical moments but also a solid inring performance from both Dusty & Savage.WrestleMania VI(""Macho Madness: The Randy Savage Ultimate Collection"")w/Dustin Rhodes vs. Ted Dibiase & Virgil - It's a nice treat to put this rare match between these two teams on here instead of their more well known Royal Rumble match.  This was a nice match between both teams with Dustin being impressive in this match for still being such a young rookie.  It should be noted that Jimmy Hart & Honky Tonk Man were doing commentary and they ended up playing a factor in this match.""MSG"" Nov. '90Bullrope Match vs. Steve Corino - For those who didn't know about this feud, Steve Corino was proclaiming himself to be a legend killer in his own right & even proclaimed himself ""The King Of Old School"" resulting in him having so many confrontations with Dusty Rhodes that led to them meeting in Dusty's match, a bullrope match.  The referee in the match also had a prior history with Corino, and his manager Jack Victory, as they attacked & bloodied him weeks earlier.  This was your typical ECW style brawl with them fighting through the crowd and Dusty even getting a few shots in on Victory while the cowbell busted both men open at times.  The referee also got his revenge on Corino before Dusty Rhodes dropped his infamous ""old school"" atomic elbow to get the victory.ECW Living Dangerously '00w/Dustin Rhodes vs. Ric Flair & Jeff Jarrett - This match was very ironic in a various ways in that this event turned out to be WCW's final PPV before being sold to Vince McMahon two weeks later...however this was the first & only time that Dusty & Flair ever had a match on PPV.  Flair was in his street clothes (if you want to refer to a hawaiian shirt along dress slacks & socks & shoes at ""street"" clothes).  This was just as entertaining as you expected with it being full of charisma from Dusty & Flair along with various comedic spots.  This was very entertaining from start to finish with an aftermath that would give Rikishi's ""stinkface"" a run for it's money.WCW Greed '01Other matches include Dusty's time in the AWA as a member of the Texas Outlaws against a young Don Muraco & Billy Robinson along with two matches against Dick The Brusier & The Crusher.  His CWF matches (that were never shown in full & were just highlights) include a tag match with Pak Song vs. The Grahams where he became the ""American Dream"", Terry Funk, and two matches against Harley Race with one being a lumberjack match & another being his NWA title victory.  Matches from his first WWWF/WWE run against Stan Stasiak & Johnny Rodz round out the extra matches on this DVD set.This is a dream set for those who were professional wrestling fans before the days of Hulkamania & sports entertainment. Back in the territorial days of professional wrestling where the NWA name was just as powerful (if not more) than the WWE name. I highly recommend this for any wrestling fan. Also the box being able to talk isn't bad either.",5,WHOO!  THAT'S FUNKY!

I'd never known that he and the late Dick ""Captain Redneck"" Murdoch were a tag team and that he'd had numerous clashes with Superstar Billy Graham, Harley Race and the like BEFORE the NWA/WCW era's. AWESOME. Also the matches with Ric Flair, Tully Blanchard, Lex Luger, his feud with the L.O.D. are all here for some good memories.

While the Bret Hart dvd isn't as good as it could've been as well. Dusty Rhoades however has tons and tons of his best matches on this dvd. Ric Flair only has one of his best matches with Sting on his dvd and doesn't even have any of his matches with Hogan or Randy Savage on it. This dvd however has all of Dusty's biggest matches. It makes me wish that WWE put as much effort into other dvds.I mean the Jake Roberts dvd could've been even better. They just focus on his drug problems and hardly on his wrestling career. We got matches where he just lost basically and where he got his ass handed to him by Steve Austin in a match. While they could've had his blind fold match with Rick Martel at WM 7 or his violent feud with Randy Savage where his nose got broken. Anyway now this dvd at least seems worth your money especially if you are a Dusty Rhoades fan though.In the Ric Flair dvd you just get one match with each feud and  here you at least get Dusty in a few big matches with people like Flair and Harley race. You get his biggest matches in NWA, WCW, WWE and even his one match in ECW with Steve Corino. This definetly does Rhoades' career justice. While a lot of Bret and Flair's biggest matches aren't even on their dvds. It makes me wish the WWE will make follow up dvds for them. Give Beniot and Eddie Guerrero another one when you're at it too. I also would love to see Rick Rude's career get justice in a 3 dvd set as well.

979004,A3LX5HJUVX8IX7,B000EU1QAE,Joey Saylor,"[5, 5]","Having viewed the majority of everything on this set, for the most part I really liked it. That is until I got to disc 3. First, I want to talk about the positives of this set. Unlike  many here, I think the documentary was well done and interesting. Especially the part when the issues with son Dustin back in the 90s are addressed. Finally we get the real story, not the trumped up internet version about Dusty turning on his son because of the ambiguity of the ""Goldust"" character. Myth 1 taken care of. This was moving and the emotion very raw. How can anyone say ""why is this talked about""?! Dusty's relationship with a son who got involved in wrestling isn't important?!As far as the Crockett days are concerned, much of what Dusty said has also been said by David Crockett, Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard. Tell me those guys are just ""covering up"" for Dusty. The one thing that may have been glossed over a bit was how and why Dusty left. Dusty seemed to imply he left because he didn't agree with Jim Herd's vision of what the NWA/WCW should become. While this is probably true to an extent given most wrestlers accounts about Herd, it's common knowledge that he lost a powerplay with Ric Flair concerning booking of his match at Starrcade '88. During Crockett's last months in power he demoted Dusty as head booker and Flair was put in charge. I think this had more to do with his departure than anything else, but that is just my opinion and mine only.On disc 2, I was very pleased with this as well. His match with Tully Blanchard from Bash '85 is presented raw and uncut with no commentary. This is particularly cool since you can hear the exchanges between the wrestlers and Baby Doll's verbal clashes with people in the crowd. To clarify, you're not going to hear them calling spots since you had 2 guys who knew how to work and what each other was thinking.The match with Ric Flair from Bash '86 is not a rehash from ""Greatest Cage Matches"". This is the raw, uncut master footage from the event, complete with Ric Flair's full entrance, and Dusty's post-match celebration. In the previous release, WWE had used the version from the commercial VHS tape JCP released back at the time. Props for really making good use of that tape library! Only downside for me was that the commentary by Rhodes & Co. was totally kayfabed. I would have preferred to hear more of the backstory on the booking of this match and how they decided what they were going to do. Still, it takes nothing away from the match.Now for what I had problems with, especially with disc 3. I agree with the other reviewers who stated there was too much made of his career with the WWF. An entire disc of this era is overkill, especialy since many view this as an embarrassment for Dusty. However, things are made much, much worse with the removal of Jesse Ventura's commentary. Do you know how painful it is to hear those long pauses with only the soundbytes of Tony Schiavone?! Not to mention listening to a Wrestlemania match with only Gorilla Monsoon seemingly talking to himself. Everybody knows the exchanges between Jesse and Gorilla helped many a sub-par matchup seem interesting. Big friggin' deal if Jesse is suing for royalties. For a company like WWE who likes to file a lawsuit every chance they get, it's pretty ironic how much they back down when someone goes after them for a change. If this is how it's going to be, than I would just assume they not include any matches from this period at all, or wait until things are settled. Note to Vince McMahon: you are not powerful enough to erase memories!!!As mentioned earlier, there are more mistakes with dates as there have been with other releases. How the production team  continues to do this is beyond me. These are things almost any fan of the time wouldn't screw up, so this tells me the people working on these releases may be like the script writers for WWE. They just work there, they aren't fans. Oh well.Lastly I enjoyed most of the promos, and some of the WWF matches aren't all bad. I got quite a few laughs from his match with Honky Tonk Man (watch for the spot where he totally messes up Honky's hairdo). I wished they had included their singoff from Primetime Wrestling which was hilarious back then. Gorilla: ""If they hung either one of them for being a good singer, they'd hang an innocent person!""This is not exactly what I would call a definitive collection, but again, I enjoyed it for the most part. It was fun and interesting to watch. Maybe if they do a Four Horsemen set we'll get the parking lot attack and other confrontations from the Crockett years.",4,"Very enjoyable, but has a few problems",1150588800,"06 18, 2006",2006,4622,"['Having', 'viewed', 'majority', 'everything', 'set', 'most', 'part', 'really', 'liked', 'got', 'disc', '3', 'First', 'want', 'talk', 'positives', 'set', 'many', 'here', 'think', 'documentary', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'interesting', 'Especially', 'part', 'when', 'issues', 'son', 'Dustin', 'back', '90s', 'are', 'addressed', 'Finally', 'get', 'real', 'story', 'not', 'trumped', 'up', 'internet', 'version', 'Dusty', 'turning', 'son', 'ambiguity', 'Goldust', 'character', 'Myth', '1', 'taken', 'care', 'was', 'moving', 'emotion', 'very', 'raw', 'How', 'can', 'anyone', 'say', 'why', 'talked', 'Dusty', 'relationship', 'son', 'who', 'got', 'involved', 'wrestling', ""n't"", 'important', 'As', 'far', 'Crockett', 'days', 'are', 'concerned', 'much', 'what', 'Dusty', 'said', 'also', 'been', 'said', 'David', 'Crockett', 'Arn', 'Anderson', 'Tully', 'Blanchard', 'Tell', 'guys', 'are', 'just', 'covering', 'up', 'Dusty', 'one', 'thing', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'glossed', 'bit', 'was', 'how', 'why', 'Dusty', 'left', 'Dusty', 'seemed', 'imply', 'left', 'did', ""n't"", 'agree', 'Jim', 'Herd', 'vision', 'what', 'NWA/WCW', 'should', 'become', 'probably', 'true', 'extent', 'given', 'most', 'wrestlers', 'accounts', 'Herd', 'common', 'knowledge', 'lost', 'powerplay', 'Ric', 'Flair', 'concerning', 'booking', 'match', 'Starrcade', 'Crockett', 'last', 'months', 'power', 'demoted', 'Dusty', 'head', 'booker', 'Flair', 'was', 'put', 'charge', 'think', 'had', 'more', 'do', 'departure', 'anything', 'else', 'just', 'opinion', 'mine', 'only.On', 'disc', '2', 'was', 'very', 'pleased', 'as', 'well', 'match', 'Tully', 'Blanchard', 'Bash', ""'85"", 'presented', 'raw', 'uncut', 'commentary', 'particularly', 'cool', 'can', 'hear', 'exchanges', 'wrestlers', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'verbal', 'clashes', 'people', 'crowd', 'clarify', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'hear', 'calling', 'spots', 'had', '2', 'guys', 'who', 'knew', 'how', 'work', 'what', 'other', 'was', 'thinking.The', 'match', 'Ric', 'Flair', 'Bash', ""'86"", 'not', 'rehash', 'Greatest', 'Cage', 'Matches', 'raw', 'uncut', 'master', 'footage', 'event', 'complete', 'Ric', 'Flair', 'full', 'entrance', 'Dusty', 'post-match', 'celebration', 'previous', 'release', 'WWE', 'had', 'used', 'version', 'commercial', 'VHS', 'tape', 'JCP', 'released', 'back', 'time', 'Props', 'really', 'making', 'good', 'use', 'tape', 'library', 'Only', 'downside', 'was', 'commentary', 'Rhodes', 'Co.', 'was', 'totally', 'kayfabed', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'hear', 'more', 'backstory', 'booking', 'match', 'how', 'decided', 'what', 'were', 'going', 'do', 'Still', 'nothing', 'away', 'match.Now', 'what', 'had', 'problems', 'especially', 'disc', '3', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'who', 'stated', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'made', 'career', 'WWF', 'entire', 'disc', 'era', 'overkill', 'especialy', 'many', 'view', 'embarrassment', 'Dusty', 'However', 'things', 'are', 'made', 'much', 'much', 'worse', 'removal', 'Jesse', 'Ventura', 'commentary', 'Do', 'know', 'how', 'painful', 'hear', 'long', 'pauses', 'only', 'soundbytes', 'Tony', 'Schiavone', 'Not', 'mention', 'listening', 'Wrestlemania', 'match', 'only', 'Gorilla', 'Monsoon', 'seemingly', 'talking', 'Everybody', 'exchanges', 'Jesse', 'Gorilla', 'helped', 'many', 'sub-par', 'matchup', 'seem', 'interesting', 'Big', 'friggin', 'deal', 'Jesse', 'suing', 'royalties', 'company', 'WWE', 'who', 'file', 'lawsuit', 'chance', 'get', 'pretty', 'ironic', 'how', 'much', 'back', 'down', 'when', 'someone', 'change', 'how', 'going', 'be', 'would', 'just', 'assume', 'not', 'include', 'matches', 'period', 'wait', 'things', 'are', 'settled', 'Note', 'Vince', 'McMahon', 'are', 'not', 'powerful', 'enough', 'erase', 'memories', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'are', 'more', 'mistakes', 'dates', 'have', 'been', 'other', 'releases', 'How', 'production', 'team', 'do', 'are', 'things', 'almost', 'fan', 'time', 'would', ""n't"", 'screw', 'up', 'people', 'working', 'releases', 'may', 'be', 'script', 'writers', 'WWE', 'just', 'work', 'there', 'are', ""n't"", 'fans', 'Oh', 'well.Lastly', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'promos', 'WWF', 'matches', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad', 'got', 'quite', 'few', 'laughs', 'match', 'Honky', 'Tonk', 'Man', 'watch', 'spot', 'where', 'totally', 'up', 'Honky', 'hairdo', 'wished', 'had', 'included', 'singoff', 'Primetime', 'Wrestling', 'was', 'hilarious', 'back', 'then', 'Gorilla', 'hung', 'one', 'being', 'good', 'singer', ""'d"", 'hang', 'innocent', 'person', 'not', 'exactly', 'what', 'would', 'call', 'definitive', 'collection', 'again', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'fun', 'interesting', 'watch', 'Maybe', 'do', 'Four', 'Horsemen', 'set', ""'ll"", 'get', 'parking', 'lot', 'attack', 'other', 'confrontations', 'Crockett', 'years']",N/A

979006,A1IMPZYRB79DMS,B000EU1QAE,Movie Fan,"[10, 13]","First, I want to say that I really wanted to like this DVD. I was never a huge fan of Dusty Rhodes the in ring worker, but I always enjoyed his mic work and thought he delivered some of the best promos in wrestling. Plus, I didn't know a lot about Dusty's early career in the 70s and things about his personal life, so I was intrigued by this release.The worst thing about this DVD, which caused me to give it only 2 stars, should have been it's strongest part and that's the documentary. First, it has a very watered down, thrown together, this isn't really important feel to it. There are some very key parts of Dusty's career that were either left out or just barely mentioned. For example, I think anyone, even a casual fan like myself, who is a fan of Rhodes, would say that his greatest rival was Terry Funk. His feud with Funk is barely mentioned and Terry wasn't even interviewed for this release. Speaking of the interviews, they really slapped them together. You get new comments from the usual WWE documentary contributers: McMahon, Pritchard, Lawler, Triple H, etc.. However, Ric Flair's comments were taken straight from his Ultimate Ric Flair Collection DVD. So, they didn't even bother to do a new interview with Flair.Then, there's the rewriting of history. Rhodes takes credit for coming up with and pushing for Ron Simmons to win the WCW World Title when that was all Bill Watts' idea. Also, Rhodes takes NO responsibility for Jim Crockett promotions going under. Rhodes pushed himself on the top spot of that promotion for too long and never allowed the younger guys to carry the ball for the company and this was a very decisive factor in that promotions demise. So, there's a lot of spin going on here. Then, they poorly chose what to focus on and spend a lot of time talking about on the documentary. They spent a lot of time trying to disprove the rumor that Vince McMahon put Dusty in polka-dots during his WWF as payback for the competition Rhodes gave them during his time with Crockett as the booker. They just really beat this to death, and half way into it, I was wanting them to just wrap it up and move on, but it's one of the longest subjects in the documentary. The WWE has released some great documentaries before, but this isn't one of them. Which is a shame because like him or not, there's no denying that Dusty Rhodes is one of the most influential people to be involved in the wrestling business in the last 30 years, and he deserved better treatment and care then what was put into this production.With that said, there are some great and rarely seen moments from Rhodes career that are worth a look. The matches unfortunately, are not great and most are not even very good, because Rhodes wasn't a great in ring worker. WWE acknowledges this by loading the DVD with promos and tv vignettes. The mic is where Dusty shined and his classic moments behind the mic are here. One of the best parts of this collection, are the old interviews that a young Vince McMahon did with Rhodes in the old WWWF. Rhodes came in as part of a trade between territories at the time (this was done a lot back then) and you could just see that Vince thinks Rhodes is incredible on the mic. You can almost see dollar signs in Vince's eyes as he interviews Rhodes because he probably wished that he could have signed Rhodes to his Dad's promotion right then and there. So, the promos are king here, but promos alone on a wrestling DVD can't save it. There are only a handful of matches here that are enjoyable. There's the cage match with Flair from the 1986 Great American Bash, which has been on 2 other WWE DVD releases, but they give it new life here by having Dusty, Steve Romero and legendary promoter Mike Graham do new commentary for the match, which is great. You also get 2 tag matches with Rhodes and Sting taking on the Road Warriors and Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard. Plus, the Superstar Billy Graham bullrope match is good, but only to die hard fans. Then, they put several matches from his ""common man"" run from 89-90 in the WWF which was terrible. To make things worse, all of Jesse Ventura's commentary has been cut from this release. So, if you're watching these matches and wondering why there are long gaps with no commentary, it's because Vince is still bitter at Ventura over their lawsuit and instead of paying Ventura for his commentary, he's just cutting it. Makes you wonder what all those Saturday Night's Main Event matches that will be on ""The History of the WWE Title"" DVD and the ""Hulk Hogan Anthology"" DVD will be handled.Overall, this release will satisfy Dusty's hardcore fans, but casual fans may wonder what all the hype is about, because the documentary really leaves you wanting more and asking more questions than feeling like you were getting an in-depth look at this man's career. The packaging is great, perhaps the best the WWE has put out. I thought the sound chip that you can press on the cover and hear classic Dusty promos was a creative and great idea, but it just come together like it should have.

979007,A2FSEGZDAONS2U,B000EU1QAE,Movie Madman,"[7, 8]","The documentary of Dusty's life didn't seem to have a lot of effort put into it. It's like they grabbed a handful of guys who were around at the time and asked them to say something about Dusty. Even John Cena mentions something on the documentary. None of the old school guys came in to say much and the few that did didn't enlighten us a whole lot. I think Arn and Tully say a few things and they recycled some stuff Flair said about Dusty in his dvd set once again.One reviewer said they had more questions after watching the documentary. I would have to agree with that. While it was cool to see Dusty's rise to fame, it seemed to skip over a lot of stuff. He blamed overspending for Jim Crockett Promotions going out of business. Of course WWE didn't get someone from Jim Crockett promotions to say anything and I know they could have because they did it for the Flair dvd. I guess some things better left unsaid.Then the argument over the polka dot phase of his career. I thought it would have been best for McMahon to just say it was a rib and clear the air. Instead, we have this weird section of the documentary where people are saying it is and it isn't. Either way, I liked the way Dusty handled it and he actually pulled it off. He could have become a joke in wrestling, but he refused and he actually made it work. For that fact alone, I actually became a Dusty fan by the end of the documentary. Makes me wish WWE had taken more time to clearly tell this man's life story. He seemed so interesting.The wrestling matches, especially those from the 70s and mid-80s are well worth the price of the dvd set. Included are tons of his interviews and vignettes. These are really cool and some were pretty funny. While the documentary should have been thrown back and redone, the rest of the dvd set was thoughtfully put together. Sure I expected to see more matches from his days in Florida, but I can forgive them from not making everyone happy on the matches. Over a 30 year career, it is tough to cover all the great matches. This dvd at least gives you the highlights and also tells a great father-son story throughout the set.",4,"Documentary sucked, but the rest was fun to watch",1154304000,"07 31, 2006",2006,2138,"['documentary', 'Dusty', 'life', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'lot', 'effort', 'put', 'grabbed', 'handful', 'guys', 'who', 'were', 'around', 'time', 'asked', 'say', 'something', 'Dusty', 'Even', 'John', 'Cena', 'mentions', 'something', 'documentary', 'None', 'old', 'school', 'guys', 'came', 'say', 'much', 'few', 'did', 'did', ""n't"", 'enlighten', 'whole', 'lot', 'think', 'Arn', 'Tully', 'say', 'few', 'things', 'recycled', 'stuff', 'Flair', 'said', 'Dusty', 'dvd', 'set', 'once', 'again.One', 'reviewer', 'said', 'had', 'more', 'questions', 'watching', 'documentary', 'would', 'have', 'agree', 'was', 'cool', 'see', 'Dusty', 'rise', 'fame', 'seemed', 'skip', 'over', 'lot', 'stuff', 'blamed', 'overspending', 'Jim', 'Crockett', 'Promotions', 'going', 'business', 'course', 'WWE', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'someone', 'Jim', 'Crockett', 'promotions', 'say', 'anything', 'know', 'could', 'have', 'did', 'Flair', 'dvd', 'guess', 'things', 'better', 'left', 'unsaid.Then', 'argument', 'polka', 'dot', 'phase', 'career', 'thought', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'McMahon', 'just', 'say', 'was', 'rib', 'clear', 'air', 'Instead', 'have', 'weird', 'section', 'documentary', 'where', 'people', 'are', 'saying', ""n't"", 'way', 'liked', 'way', 'Dusty', 'handled', 'actually', 'pulled', 'off', 'could', 'have', 'become', 'joke', 'wrestling', 'refused', 'actually', 'made', 'work', 'fact', 'alone', 'actually', 'became', 'Dusty', 'fan', 'end', 'documentary', 'Makes', 'wish', 'WWE', 'had', 'taken', 'more', 'time', 'clearly', 'tell', 'man', 'life', 'story', 'seemed', 'so', 'interesting.The', 'wrestling', 'matches', 'especially', '70s', 'mid-80s', 'are', 'well', 'price', 'dvd', 'set', 'Included', 'are', 'tons', 'interviews', 'vignettes', 'are', 'really', 'cool', 'were', 'pretty', 'funny', 'documentary', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'thrown', 'back', 'redone', 'rest', 'dvd', 'set', 'was', 'thoughtfully', 'put', 'together', 'Sure', 'expected', 'see', 'more', 'matches', 'days', 'Florida', 'can', 'forgive', 'not', 'making', 'everyone', 'happy', 'matches', '30', 'year', 'career', 'tough', 'cover', 'great', 'matches', 'dvd', 'least', 'highlights', 'also', 'great', 'father-son', 'story', 'set']",N/A

For this dvd its the interviews.Dusty is the best known talker of the 80s. His ""less is more"" wrestling style earned him a ""Most over rated wrestler"" award from PWI in the 80s. But his matches had to be shown. Some are great, some are mediocre, some just don't do his ""talk them into the arena"" ability justice. If you read his book, the story was a jumble of promos and experiences that can be summed into one word, clusterf**k.
