Never mind the 1960's stiff acting and fairly poor picture quality by todays standards. This movie will steal your heart! The loving relationship between husband and wife, the wonderful shots of nature and the tight bond between a wild animal and his human mother...it's simply a heartwarming movie! Note: There are a few ""intense moments"". The movie starts with a lion eating a human (we only see bloody river and floating clothing, but still, it might scare little ones who actually ""get it"". There are scenes of lions fighting, and Elsa does get hurt by other lions a few times. But if you can narrate it as you watch it, the kids should be fine. I wouldn't let anyone under 5 watch it however.*** spoiler alert****I was afraid that Elsa would become wild and forget her human parents (which would have broken my daughter's heart), but that doesn't happen. Although Elsa learned to live free in the wild, and had her own lion family, she remained loving towards her human parents and they made it clear that they saw her many more times.

733687,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0000844M8,Ed Uyeshima,"[3, 4]","Propelled by Matt Munro's Sinatra-esque rendition of the memorable title tune, this family-friendly nature film directed by James Hill was a must-see when it was originally released in 1966. Four decades later, the song has become a anthem-like clich&eacute; for all subsequent animal-freeing stories, and I'm actually surprised at the implied graphic nature of some of the scenes, in particular, the opening lion attack which spurs  British game warden George Adamson to kill the man-eating parents of Elsa and her two sister cubs. However, the heart of the story is still his wife Joy's true-story account of raising and freeing Elsa into the wild to survive rather than suffer the fate of her siblings who are exiled to the Rotterdam Zoo. The stunning Kenya locations and carefully trained lions bring this involving story to life, but credit should also be given to Virginia McKenna's proud, touching performance as Joy.McKenna makes us see Elsa through her eyes as she mothers the cub only to be forced to come to terms with what the animal's natural instincts should be. Bill Travers, McKenna's real-life husband, plays George, though he is there mostly to be Joy's support system. Because the film only runs a brief 95 minutes, the story can feel episodic and disjointed, giving precious little time to related plot points such as George's drug dependency from malaria and how Joy's reasoning is clouded by her focused affection for Elsa. Fleshing out these aspects could have made for a more rounded portrait of the Adamsons. As it stands, it is still a stunningly photographed adventure film documentary-like in cinematic style but leavened by its heartfelt approach. It's no wonder McKenna and Travers remained active in the conservation movement for years afterward.

The DVD, by virtue of totally lacking extras, utterly fails to answer any of those questions.

This movie tells and shows you why. The movie is based on a true story from a book by Joy Adamson. The movie is set back in the 1950 era when George Adamson who is the game warden for the Kenya area in Africa.  While out on a routine run George has to kill a charging female lion in self defense. After George kills the lion he discovers that the lion was a mother as three lion cubs come out of no where. George takes the 3 cub's home because he knows that if he didn't the cubs will die. When the cubs get too much to handle they have to make the hardest decision of their life. Do they send the animals to the Rotterdam Zoo? Do they send all the cubs or do they keep one?  To me the acting was great as Bill Travers and Virginia McKenna play George and Joy Adamson. As a side note McKenna also narrates the story as Joy voice-over, using the book. The real star of the show, though, is Elsa herself, actually played by three different lionesses. You can really see the genuine affection between the large cat and her caretakers as they interact. It is magical to watch. This movie would be great for you and your family because there's none of the following in this picture. There's really no violence, and there's no sex or any swearing for that matter. The entire movie was shot in Africa.

This is a sweet movie of a wonderful true story, performed superbly by the actors and even by the animals (whom you won't like to think as animals after the movie finishes).Apart from technicalities (vivid imagery of Kenya), acting and top class music, what I liked most of the movie is the simple, lyrical way it tells us the eternal story of life cycle. Not only of lions or animals, but human being as well, may be of all living beings.Passion and care in grooming Elsa and her siblings were no different than grooming one's own children (the couple had no children), while the way Elsa has been trained to acclimatized to the world including swimming only reminds us about growing kids. The ultimate test of parenthood for the couple came to teach and facilitate Elsa to have a partner in the wild, which brought in as much excitement, joy, suspense and concern as parents feel when their daughter gets married. The wonder of the movie is, through this cycle of the lions, we remember the eternal cycle of life of human being as well. Starting with Elsa's cubhood to her motherhood, thereby triggering another set of cubhood - the film charms us with this ageless story of life cycle.

733695,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,B0000844M8,Gregor von Kallahann,"[3, 4]","I was trying to remember just why I never saw this film when it first came out--or subsequently when it might have been shown on TV--when it occurred to me that it was released in 1966 when I was 13, just at the age when I was suddenly less interested in ""kids' stuff"" like BORN FREE and increasingly interested in HELP or A HARD DAY'S NIGHT.  But deep down, I had always liked animal flicks, and maybe even then--at least in the back of my mind--figured I'd catch up with this tale of a tame lionness, whose ""human companions"" attempt to re-train in the ways of the wild.Viewing the film as an adult, I can see that I probably would have liked it well enough as a youngster, and can agree with the majority of reviewers below, that it is a solid, engaging ""family film,"" and a pleasant alternative to much of the brash, jaded and bankrupt fare offered to kids nowadays.  It seems pretty wholesome  by comparison.Like many family films of the era, however, it was also relatively low budget and not all that ""well made"" a product.  The story is a bit on the sketchy side, and you can see the filmmakers making a very deliberate effort to compress the contents of Joy Adamson's book into a 90 minute film.  One example that comes to mind are the references to Joy's husband's near-fatal battle with malaria.  His initial bout is never shown, only referred to in a voice over by actress Virginia McKenna, who plays Joy.  Well, fair enough, I figured, it's not that essential to the story of Elsa, the lionness, and it might be disturbing to younger viewers, so leave it out.  But then, a later relapse is portrayed in pretty graphic detail.  It seems to come almost out of the blue, and will likely confuse younger viewers who may not have seen it coming from the brief mention in the voiceover narration.Films aimed at children, and their families, often seem to cut corners this way.  In the case of a film based on real life, as this one is, there is also the question of just how much dramatic license to take.  I never read Adamson's book on which the film is based, but it seems like the movie version must have hewed fairly closely to the text.  There are scenes such as the ""roving lion in the night"" sequence that promise some drama--and some danger--only to pretty much peter out in the end.If that's the case, the filmmakers are actually to be commended for not taking too many liberties with the text.  But better direction, overall pacing and editing can help spice up scenes like these, ones where the action is muted, because in real life, the danger really did pass, or was not as great as it seemed to begin with.None of this is meant to suggest that the film is not worth seeing.  They really DON'T make 'em like this any more.  Nowadays, Elsa would have had to engage in a battle royal with the roving lion that prowls around the camp at night, and the computer graphics would be dazzling but ultimately misleading.  Parents and children alike will appreciate this film's slower pace, its implicit message on the reverence and preservation of the natural world (an even more vital question today than it was then).  In an era when the need to protect and preserve wildlife and its habitat is even clearer than it was 40 years ago, BORN FREE serves as a reminder that there is much work to be done--but that it's well worth the effort.",4,Call of the Wild,1198195200,"12 21, 2007",2007,3351,"['was', 'trying', 'remember', 'just', 'why', 'never', 'saw', 'film', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'subsequently', 'when', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'shown', 'TV', 'when', 'occurred', 'was', 'released', '1966', 'when', 'was', '13', 'just', 'age', 'when', 'was', 'suddenly', 'less', 'interested', 'kids', 'stuff', 'BORN', 'FREE', 'increasingly', 'interested', 'HELP', 'A', 'HARD', 'DAY', 'NIGHT', 'deep', 'had', 'always', 'liked', 'animal', 'flicks', 'maybe', 'even', 'then', 'least', 'back', 'mind', 'figured', ""'d"", 'catch', 'up', 'tale', 'tame', 'lionness', 'human', 'companions', 'attempt', 're-train', 'ways', 'wild.Viewing', 'film', 'adult', 'can', 'see', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'well', 'enough', 'youngster', 'can', 'agree', 'majority', 'reviewers', 'solid', 'engaging', 'family', 'film', 'pleasant', 'alternative', 'much', 'brash', 'jaded', 'bankrupt', 'fare', 'offered', 'kids', 'nowadays', 'pretty', 'wholesome', 'comparison.Like', 'many', 'family', 'films', 'era', 'however', 'was', 'also', 'relatively', 'low', 'budget', 'not', 'well', 'made', 'product', 'story', 'bit', 'sketchy', 'side', 'can', 'see', 'filmmakers', 'making', 'very', 'deliberate', 'effort', 'compress', 'contents', 'Joy', 'Adamson', 'book', '90', 'minute', 'film', 'One', 'example', 'mind', 'are', 'references', 'Joy', 'husband', 'near-fatal', 'battle', 'malaria', 'initial', 'bout', 'never', 'shown', 'only', 'referred', 'voice', 'actress', 'Virginia', 'McKenna', 'who', 'Joy', 'Well', 'fair', 'enough', 'figured', 'not', 'essential', 'story', 'Elsa', 'lionness', 'might', 'be', 'disturbing', 'younger', 'viewers', 'so', 'leave', 'out', 'then', 'later', 'relapse', 'portrayed', 'pretty', 'graphic', 'detail', 'come', 'almost', 'blue', 'will', 'likely', 'confuse', 'younger', 'viewers', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'seen', 'coming', 'brief', 'mention', 'voiceover', 'narration.Films', 'aimed', 'children', 'families', 'often', 'seem', 'cut', 'corners', 'way', 'case', 'film', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'one', 'also', 'question', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'dramatic', 'license', 'take', 'never', 'read', 'Adamson', 'book', 'film', 'based', 'movie', 'version', 'must', 'have', 'hewed', 'fairly', 'closely', 'text', 'are', 'scenes', 'such', 'roving', 'lion', 'night', 'sequence', 'promise', 'drama', 'danger', 'only', 'pretty', 'much', 'peter', 'end.If', 'case', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'actually', 'be', 'commended', 'not', 'taking', 'too', 'many', 'liberties', 'text', 'better', 'direction', 'overall', 'pacing', 'editing', 'can', 'help', 'spice', 'up', 'scenes', 'ones', 'where', 'action', 'muted', 'real', 'life', 'danger', 'really', 'did', 'pass', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'great', 'seemed', 'begin', 'with.None', 'meant', 'suggest', 'film', 'not', 'worth', 'seeing', 'really', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'make', ""'em"", 'like', 'more', 'Nowadays', 'Elsa', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'engage', 'battle', 'royal', 'roving', 'lion', 'camp', 'night', 'computer', 'graphics', 'would', 'be', 'dazzling', 'ultimately', 'misleading', 'Parents', 'children', 'alike', 'will', 'appreciate', 'film', 'slower', 'pace', 'implicit', 'message', 'reverence', 'preservation', 'natural', 'world', 'even', 'more', 'vital', 'question', 'today', 'was', 'then', 'era', 'when', 'need', 'protect', 'preserve', 'wildlife', 'habitat', 'even', 'clearer', 'was', '40', 'years', 'ago', 'BORN', 'FREE', 'reminder', 'much', 'work', 'be', 'done', 'well', 'effort']",N/A

I was in college when I saw it as a first run movie in 1966, and I fell in love with the story. Before my wife left on a three-week visit to Kenya a few years ago, I loaded up her MP3 player with several hours of music, but the track she wanted most was John Barry's theme to Born Free. It's a great song that complements the film perfectly.There are few films from the era of the 1960s that have stood the test of time as well as Born Free. And it's one of the few &#34;family&#34; movies that doesn't come across as hopelessly syrupy today. The film is a visual treat, and Virginia McKenna and Bill Travers are marvelous as the Adamsons. The lions - especially Elsa - are the co-stars of the film, and the scene where George and Joy Adamson return to Africa after a long absence and find Elsa (and a surprise) is one of the most heartwarming scenes in movie history.Unfortunately, in real life, the Adamson's story had a tragic ending. George and Joy separated in 1970, but they continued to spend Christmas holidays together until she was murdered on January 3, 1980, in Shaba National Reserve in Kenya.

Of course, that soon became impossible, so they set about rehabilitating her back into the wild knowing she might not survive, but feeling she must have the chance to live free.In the 1950s, no one had ever reintroduced an animal to the wild, and the Adamses were the first animal lovers to do so.

As it is based on a true story, that makes it even better.  And what a story it is too.Game warden George Adamson and his wife Joy are residents in Kenya, Africa and relate their experiences of raising an orphaned lion cub after the mother has been shot out of self-defense reasons.  Actually it is three lion cubs but two are sent off to a zoo and the third, eventually named Elsa, is raised by Joy Adamson.  It is interesting and enjoyable to watch the interaction of the cub with the adults and the relationship that grows ever closer between them.  Upon raising the cub to maturity, it becomes a difficult time for the Adamson's knowing that releasing the grown lion into the wild is the only real answer.  Due to being tame for so long, it is Joy's responsibility now to train Elsa to be able to survive on its own and she does an admirable job.  When the fateful day finally comes, it tugs at the heart strings to see the emotional effects on the Adamson's when releasing something they love so dearly.  It is also inspiring knowing that they cared so much and did it for all the right reasons.  It eventually makes for a wonderful end to a great movie.As for the film particulars, the cinematography is very attractive in Africa and the accompanying music is a perfect compliment to everything else.  The acting is so innocent and natural you can almost be fooled into believing this isn't a movie.  For being a timeless classic that is now over 4 decades old, this movie stands the test of time and will always be a treasure for anyone and everyone.

Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[1, 1]","It may be hard to believe that there were classic family films created in the 60's by anyone other than Disney. This movie is an example of a very good and classic family film, one where the only car chase is after a lion, there are no video games to be seen anywhere, and the central themes of the movie are love and that wild things should live free.This movie is based on a book by Joy Adamson by the same name and chronicles her and her husband's experiences with a trio of lion cubs. Eventually two of the cubs are sent to a zoo, but the third lion, a lioness that Joy calls Elsa, remains with Joy and her husband George. Of course, lions are wild animals and they can live with people for only so long.  Joy is faced with the need to have Elsa sent to a zoo. Joy is unable to think of Elsa being caged when she has been free for her whole life, so she attempts what had not been done before; repatriation of a captive lion back into the wild.Elsa and her husband worked long, hard and with a lot of frustration, despaired that Elsa would never be able to go back to the wild, or that she would die as a result of their attempts. All along the way you can see Joy Adamson's love for Elsa and her need to see Elsa be able to return to the wild.Andy Williams sings ""Born Free"" to accompany the end of the movie. This song is one of Andy Williams' best. If you are familiar with this song you will recognize portions of it throughout the movie as a recurring theme.This movie is simple and heart-warming.

Then it was hinted that she had been murdered with a weapon which inflicted wounds similar to a lion's...traces of metal in the cut flesh. Finally, Paul Nakware Ekai, one of the compound's employees, was charged and convicted of her murder. He initially admitted to stabbing Joy, later stating that she had shot him in the foot, and he, in turn, of shooting her three times. Her temperament was not, by some accounts, remotely similar to Miss  McKenna's.George was shot and killed by Somali bandits while coming to the aid of a safari.Parenthetically, Dian Fossey (Gorillas in the Mist)was brutally murdered in 1985.

It was an absolute delight to watch with them, starting from the playing of lion cubs in a house to the struggle to re-introduce Elsie into the wild.  Of particular interest was the notion that the conventional wisdom about animals is wrong, that a deeper entente and understanding with them is possible if humans would only try.Joy Adamson developed a relationship with Elsie much as a mother would treat a child.  Though a dangerous animal to most observers, including her husband's boss, she loved the lion and influenced her personality development.  She then figured out a way to release Elsie into the wild again, which no one had ever succeeded in doing.  Finally, a year later, the couple found Elsie and ""visited"" with her and her cubs for an entire day, until her mate called from the distance; they would return in subsequent years to get to know the cubs.  Perhaps I am reading too much into it, but it seems to me that Joy discovered other possibilities of being and communication with a wild animal, which should get us all to think beyond genetic determinism and conventional behavioral models.  This is very profound as we contemplate the management of the planet in perilous times.The beauty of our experience is that the kids and I could discuss these issues as well as enjoy the spectacle of an animal film that was fun and very funny yet moving.  While I suspect that much of it is fictionalized - the couple later divorced and George Adamson died by recklessly driving at poachers trying to warn him off - the acting is wonderful as is the photography.

Based on the true story of Joy and George Adamson and their experiences raising the lioness named Elsa, Born Free is a heartwarming story of unconditional love. When George is called upon to kill a male lion that was known for killing and mauling local people in Kenya, he stumbles across 3 small helpless lion cubs which he brings home. Virginia McKenna and Bill Travers, who play Joy and George Adamson deliver a wonderful performance. Joy and George sucessfully rear these 3 cubs with 2 of them eventually going off to zoos. All 3 cubs were loved and well taken care of but because of Joy's love and fondness  of the 3rd cub she named Elsa, the Adamson's decided to keep Elsa and raise her themselves with the intention of one day teaching her to hunt on her own and eventually releasing her to be free and survive on her own in the wild. We see the love that can be shared between people and yes, even a lioness. There are many touching moments in this film. Being filmed in Africa, we get to see the beauty of the areas that Elsa roamed and shared with the Adamsons. We experience the heartbreak that Joy endured when it was time to set Elsa free to be on her own. Elsa never forgot her adopted parents and visited them often. The Adamson's hard work paid off as Elsa returned to the wild and survived on her own and eventually found a mate and gave birth to 3 cubs of her own. There is a part 2 and 3 to Born Free and they are Living Free and Forever Free. Both are great movies as we follow Elsa's 3 cubs after her death. There are also books written by Joy Adamson with the same titles. This movie will truly touch your heart in many ways. The song Born Free will forever remind me of Elsa and what a special lioness she was along with the Adamsons who succeeded at doing something that no one else had ever done.... raise a lion cub and return it to the wild to survive and thrive on her own.

Where it shows its age is when the humans take centre-stage. At times Virginia McKenna can be a bit too head girl of the hockey school as Joy Adamson for a modern audience - while the Adamsons' real-life relationship was so tempestuous they spent much of their lives apart (Travers recalled that during filming whenever George was in the doghouse, Joy would treat him with equal condescension), their movie incarnations are so determinedly nice they make characters from Disney films of the 60s look like axe murderers. That said, McKenna and Travers are one of the few real-life married couples who make a convincing couple onscreen, bringing a comfortable familiarity to their scenes that smoothes over some of the more twee dialogue.Its surprise success after a slow start led to director James Hill reluctantly being typecast on many of the slew of similar animal films that followed in its wake while his two stars started the Born Free foundation to release zoo animals into the wild. It also led to a very unfortunate sequel, Living Free, though none of the key players apart from Carl Foreman would return.Not much in the way of extras - only trailers - but a good widescreen transfer.",4,One of the all-time great animal films,1203120000,"02 16, 2008",2008,1642,"['Lassie', 'Come', 'Home', 'Born', 'Free', 'probably', 'gold', 'standard', 'animal', 'movies', 'terms', 'lot', 'like', 'story', 'Joy', 'Adamson', 'gamekeeper', 'husband', 'trying', 'return', 'domesticated', 'lioness', 'Elsa', 'wild', 'lion', 'cubs', 'are', 'cute', 'Scope', 'wildlife', 'photography', 'still', 'impressive', 'John', 'Barry', 'score', 'especially', 'beautiful', 'famous', 'Matt', 'Munro', 'song', 'was', 'added', 'end', 'titles', 'film', 'was', 'already', 'release', 'Where', 'age', 'when', 'humans', 'take', 'centre-stage', 'times', 'Virginia', 'McKenna', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'too', 'head', 'girl', 'hockey', 'school', 'Joy', 'Adamson', 'modern', 'audience', 'Adamsons', 'real-life', 'relationship', 'was', 'so', 'tempestuous', 'spent', 'much', 'lives', 'apart', 'Travers', 'recalled', 'filming', 'whenever', 'George', 'was', 'doghouse', 'Joy', 'would', 'treat', 'equal', 'condescension', 'movie', 'incarnations', 'are', 'so', 'determinedly', 'nice', 'make', 'characters', 'Disney', 'films', '60s', 'look', 'axe', 'murderers', 'said', 'McKenna', 'Travers', 'are', 'one', 'few', 'real-life', 'married', 'couples', 'who', 'make', 'convincing', 'couple', 'onscreen', 'bringing', 'comfortable', 'familiarity', 'scenes', 'smoothes', 'more', 'twee', 'dialogue.Its', 'surprise', 'success', 'slow', 'start', 'led', 'director', 'James', 'Hill', 'reluctantly', 'being', 'typecast', 'many', 'slew', 'similar', 'animal', 'films', 'followed', 'wake', 'two', 'stars', 'started', 'Born', 'Free', 'foundation', 'release', 'zoo', 'animals', 'wild', 'also', 'led', 'very', 'unfortunate', 'sequel', 'Living', 'Free', 'none', 'key', 'players', 'apart', 'Carl', 'Foreman', 'would', 'return.Not', 'much', 'way', 'extras', 'only', 'good', 'widescreen', 'transfer']",N/A

It tells the story of a couple living in Africa who come across three orphan lion cubs and keep one female, whom they name Elsa. Later they are pressured to give Elsa up to a zoo, but the woman can't because, as she argues, Elsa was born free and should therefore live free. She'd never be happy in a zoo.Unfortunately, Elsa has become too tame as a result of living with the couple. Can Elsa ever adapt to the wild or will she be condemned to a cage in a zoo?The footage of Elsa with the couple is amazing. She's like their pet cat! I'd love to have a lioness pet to hug and pat and walk around the yard with!Shot in beautiful Kenya, the film runs 95 minutes.GRADE: B+",4,A must for animal lovers,1352160000,"11 6, 2012",2012,746,"['Born', 'Free', '1965', 'great', 'film', 'animal', 'lovers', 'especially', 'cat', 'lovers', 'story', 'couple', 'living', 'Africa', 'who', 'come', 'three', 'orphan', 'lion', 'cubs', 'keep', 'one', 'female', 'whom', 'name', 'Elsa', 'Later', 'are', 'pressured', 'give', 'Elsa', 'up', 'zoo', 'woman', 'ca', ""n't"", 'because', 'Elsa', 'was', 'born', 'free', 'should', 'therefore', 'live', 'free', ""'d"", 'never', 'be', 'happy', 'zoo.Unfortunately', 'Elsa', 'become', 'too', 'tame', 'result', 'living', 'couple', 'Can', 'Elsa', 'ever', 'adapt', 'wild', 'will', 'be', 'condemned', 'cage', 'zoo', 'footage', 'Elsa', 'couple', 'amazing', 'pet', 'cat', ""'d"", 'love', 'have', 'lioness', 'pet', 'hug', 'pat', 'walk', 'yard', 'Shot', 'beautiful', 'Kenya', 'film', '95', 'minutes.GRADE', 'B+']",N/A
