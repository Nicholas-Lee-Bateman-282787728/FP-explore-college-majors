983093,A3NW2MN6JH8OL3,B000F4RHBQ,Almost 50 Lassie fan,"[2, 2]","I saw Part I of this series when it originally aired on PBS many years ago.  I bought this to see the remaining episodes.  It was a worthwhile purchase!  I honestly think my area PBS stations only aired this one time, which wouldn't surprise me, given that it really is about--as its description says clearly--the lesbian relationship between these two women and its impact on ALL of those, but especially their husbands, around them.  Everyone in this production is a fine actor.  The story is inherently interesting, in part because it involved at least one famous person, Vita Sackville-West.  And these women, even without one another's dynamic relationship, were interesting people by themselves.  I must admit, to me, this production is driven by character and conflict.  If you want typical action-packed, fast-paced American viewing, this is NOT for you.  If you abhor lesbianism (for whatever reasons), this is not for you.  I did find myself splitting up these episodes, watching each on a different night, over three nights.  Much of this story is, at least I think, depressing.  I simply couldn't watch more than one episode a night without having it make ME feel down, but I'm very glad I have this production.

Nearly two decades old, it was shocking at the time, before the show became the redundant ""Masterpiece Classic"" and more historically than emotionally authentic. ""Portrait"" has endured. In the '90s, the Bloomsbury group inspired numerous movies, from this series to Sally Potter's ""Orlando"" and Emma Thompson in ""Carrington.""""Portrait of a Marriage"" is a biopic of feminist author Vita Sackville-West and her diplomat husband, Harold Nicolson. They married, and had a deep emotional bond, despite the fact Harold had flings with handsome young men, and Vita carried on with women--such as Virginia Woolf. The series is quite affecting in showing their affectionate, passionate devotion. Janet McTeer and David Haig are an excellent, credible couple. Their marriage is endangered by Vita's longtime friend, Violet Keppel (Cathryn Harrison). Vita is torn between her husband's devotion and Violet's flighty passion. Harold provides constancy,despite the fact he has a handsome unseen lover named Edward in Paris. Vita and Violet are impassioned&obsessed.; One can argue that it was the infidelity and the obsession that was the problem, not the homosexuality.""Portrait of a Marriage"" is a superb period piece.

It's almost too good to be true, which is exactly what is shown in this engrossing dramatization. The acting is flawless, but the characters seem hardly attractive. Vita Sackville-West plays a terribly selfish, destructive person who talks a good game of devotion to husband and children, but loses herself so much in her passing lusts that she not only can't see why she should spend Christmas with her family, but can't see why the British should defeat Hitler. She's giddy with her new-found sexual liberation but becomes a stranger to reason and, finally, almost wholly unsympathetic. Her horsey bad looks and fabulous wealth evidently made her irresistible to some, but as acted this is a woman who verges on the detestable. Husband Harold is oddly weak and ordinary.

The drama of passion and the devastating jealousy between the women, combined simultaneously with real love and devotion between Vita and her bi-sexual husband, Harold Nicholson, fills every sense. The love scenes between the women are refreshingly realistic and passionate; with every liaison, Vita becomes more and more torn between her two loves.  Excellent cinimatography.

Sondel - lover of the arts""","[7, 7]","I'm appalled by all the positive reviews of this rather tired and maudlin film which is said to be based on the altogether wonderful book ""Portrait of a Marriage"" by Nigel Nicolson.  As far as adapatations go, this is one of the least faithful I've ever encountered.  Either the writer of the film used various sources other than Nicolson's book, or she made things up (which is not likely).  Gone is the rich history of her mother and grandfather, of growing up, of her later years and relationship with Virginia Woolf.  Only a brief line or two mentions Vita's first romance with Rosamond.  This is not a portrait of a marriage, but rather the portrait of an affair.  Vita is portrayed as a spoiled malcontent trapped in a loveless marriage (which is the opposite of the portrait in the book).  The cast is not at fault; indeed they are all to be praised (especially McTeer).  Likewise, the production elements are all first rate.  It is the direction, teleplay and dramatic pacing which are at odds with the source material.  The characters are poorly drawn, and their motivations not well articulated.  What about Violet has captured and possessed Vita, is it her personality,her sexual magnatism, is she thrilling and vibrant?  Not here.  We have no ""real"" clue as to what has brought these two women together in such an all consuming passion.  These characters - as depicted - are spoiled rich brats; and it was hard for me to give a damn about them and their ""classy"" problems.  The book is so rich is detail, history and atmosphere which this film doesn't even attempt to capture.  It is a one note affair (pardon the pun) and one I can not in good faith recommend.

I've been letting many a bisexual female friend borrow my copy, so I'm glad this is finally on DVD.  As popular as the topic of female bisexuality is now, I'm really surprised the producers didn't make this decision sooner.There have been many films where one spouse comes out as gay (""Brokeback Mountain,"" ""Making Love,"" and ""Lianna"" are examples).  However, this was a rare description of a ""lavender marriage"" where both spouses are gay.  This film may be revolutionary to see for couples that fit that description.This work was quite pioneering for its time.  Cinema fans who love seeing women's narratives in Europe during the first half of the 20th Century will love this.  Works such as ""Tipping the Velvet"", ""Henry and June"", and ""Paris Was a Woman"" came after this movie and may have copied elements of it.Just like ""Brokeback Mountain,"" this film has a tragic conclusion (I haven't given up the plot, you'll have to see it to know what I mean).

Davenport ""neurologyroger""","[18, 19]","I first watched this series when it came out in much anticipated weekly installments on Masterpiece Theater in 1992.  My rapture lasted from Sunday to Sunday and having now the full serving at one sitting allows me to recapture small nuances that had fallen into the abyss of forgetfulness (it was fourteen years ago!)  The story of the Nicolsons and of Vita and Violet is the story of a longing that exhilarates and crushes, as Janet McTeer's face and actions vividly capture.  Her longing for Violet, as compared to her true longing for her husband, makes one believe that loving only one person is perhaps unnatural and unhealthy.  Harold comes across as truly ""male"" in that he expects Vita to return to him even though he continues to pursue his same-sex relationships.  One sometimes wonders if his love for her is truly deep or whether his awareness of social convention is stronger than Vita's, as she continuously lives on the edges of her passions.  Vita is striking as portrayed by Ms McTeer, both as a woman and disguised as a man.  Violet is a striking beauty but comes off as more needy and less insightful.  Mr. Trefusis is portrayed as a prig, lost in a vortex of passion that he cannot feel, much less comprehend.  This is a most thoughtful and detailed ""portrait"" of relationships--male/female and female/female--without condescension or judgment.
