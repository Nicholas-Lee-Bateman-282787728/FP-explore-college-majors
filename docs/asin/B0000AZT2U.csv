What would a Christian from the late-1800's think of our society & faith today? Challenging & thought-provoking, this movie is an above average offering to the Christian market. Though most children & jr. high students may struggle to truly grasp the depth of this film, high school students & adults will be encouraged to evaluate the choices made every day in regards to music, movies, language, & dress, among other things.Overall the acting was excellent, though at times the stiffness of the 19th-century characters was distracting (could've made this rating 4 stars instead of 5, but the film's relevance trumps that). I hold the director responsible for this, however, not the actors. The pace of the plot was superb, moving along at a steady clip & unencumbered by pointless dialogue. The script was well-written, staying true to the questions, can we have morals without a moral authority (God) and are today's Christians living in the world or part of it?I enjoyed this movie immensely & highly recommend it to anyone looking to challenge themselves.

769238,A2JSGJE2IGJU20,B0000AZT2U,a voice of reason,"[12, 14]","This is by far one of the best Christian films that I have seen, and it presents important issues for consideration for both non-believers and believers in Jesus.For non-Christians, the effect of our society's moral relativism on peoples' lives and interactions with others is shown. People get hurt and hurt others all the time because everybody is too busy doing what ""works for ME."" Most people do try to be good people, but they think that this means avoiding only the 'big' sins like murder, assault, rape, etc.; they think nothing of lying, stealing, sexual immorality and a slew of other, 'little' sins. This film contains the reminder that no one can be good apart from Christ; as the Bible states, if we do things apart from God, then all our good works are as ""filthy rags"" to Him. The good news, which this film also clearly presents, is that forgiveness and salvation are available through Jesus, and that He has prepared good works for us to do in order that we can be a blessing to others (not to try to earn our way into heaven, which we can never do).However, this is not just a film for the non-believer; it also forces Christians to look at how we are living our lives. I must admit that I got a bit uncomfortable during the scenes in which the characters discuss a movie that their church group has just seen. We have to walk a fine line between not isolating ourselves from the world and yet not succumbing to its temptations either. The movie-discussion scene shows how easily we sometimes give in to the world rather than maintaining our standards and providing an example for non-believers. It also provides good reminders that we should not begin to take our faith for granted and simply 'go through the motions' of worship and church activities.Although the film has many important messages, it is also a good piece of entertainment. As I was watching it, I began to think of it (quite obviously) as a Christian version of H.G. Wells's ""The Time Machine."" Fortunately, because of it's focus on Jesus, this film has a more positive outlook than Wells's novel (and the films based on it) had.

The story line is on a professor of bible studies at Grace Seminary in 1890.  He is attempting to get one of his works published and needs the coveted endorsement of the seminary where he teaches.  He has all board memebers' approval except one.  Here, the story gets better.  He has some extended conversations with the professor who refuses to give his endorsement and both characters are at odds with one another.  Eventually, the professor (David Morin) must decide for himself why his work is not quite ""up to par"" with the antagonist professor Anderson (Gavin McLeod).  To prove his point, professor Anderson sends the irritated Carlisle into the future to test his ""works"" and make the decision for himself.The acting in the movie are good to excellent.  Most of the stars in the movie are comfortable in their roles, especially Jennifer O'Neil, who gives a 4 minute take on the movie industry, in which she once worked in, in her role of Christian librarian (since she is Christian in real life, I suspect she was also revealing her Christian background in her role).  Her part was small for such a star of her caliber.  Hal Linden, Richard Reihle, Paul Rodriguez and Gavin McLeod give good performances.There were some ""holes"" that should have been filled in a longer version of the film, but trying to keep it at an hour and half, the film makes the story a little ""less filling"" than it should be.  The story could have been longer and certainly more entertaining with its special effects.  But, ultimately, the story has a very strong message and that is that Jesus Christ is THE only answer.  This may offend some people but this is, after all, a Christian movie that is geared for those who are either teetering on their faith or those who need to hear the ""truth.""This Christian film is Hollywood quality (albeit, no where near the production levels of some of the major multi-million dollar films), and the film making of Rich Christiano is excellent.

I wanted to write this review before the effect the movie had on me, faded away.  This film made me realize certain things.  One of those things is that I myself, have strayed from Jesus a bit.  I stopped going to church 14 or 15 years ago and I used to say prayers at night before falling asleep.  I haven't done that in many, many years.  I still believe in Jesus strongly, but I don't think about him and what he has done for us, nearly as much as I used to.  This movie is very good.  It's not just for extremely religious people, but for anyone.  The speech that Dr. Russell Carlisle gives at the Church, right near the end of the movie, could almost bring a tear to your eye.  It was a very moving speech and as you are listening to it you keep saying to yourself that everything he is preaching to the people is absolutely true.  Society is moving further and further away from the teachings of Jesus.  We have become more rude and more cruel towards one another.  We are more self-centered than we ever were before.  In this film they quote the divorce rate in 1890 as being 5% and they were shocked by that back then.  Then in the year 2000 the divorce rate is quoted again at being 50%.  Earlier this year (2003) the United States had a divorce rate of 57%.  That is the highest that it has ever been in history.  We were also tied with another country, for having the highest divorce rate of any nation on Earth.  What has happened to our society ?

There is some drama and tension in the movie, which is nice. It does date itself at times, particularly when looking at the ""modern"" world in the movie. However, as time passes you realize how on target the movie is. What was seen as a more sinful ""modern"" world would be an age of innocence to us today. It really does highlight how accurate this movie may have been after all.I have read reviews that mention the movie doesn't address the sins of the historical time in the movie. No, it doesn't, but that isn't the point. The point of the movie is the more we remove Christ from society, the more sin becomes mainstream and normal. Also, not everyone in historical American embraced slavery (ever hear of abolitionist and the many states that didn't allow slavery?). There has been sin since the days of Adam and Eve, the point is how sin is viewed. The point of the film seems to be that the more we push Christ away, the more acceptable sin becomes to society.Four stars because it does have some slow parts and the acting is strained at times.

Or, how would you feel if you were transported forward 100 years into the future...Time Changer, an amazing new film directed by Christian producer Rich Christiano, is finally on DVD and home video. This movie is a surprisingly well produced and well done film by Five &amp; Two pictures, and boasts some surprisingly big actors featured in the film.PLOT: Dr. Russell Carlisle (D. David Morin), a professor at Grace Bible Seminary, has just completed a new book entitled The Changing Times. He hopes to secure approval and endorsement from the board of directors at the Seminary. However, one board member, Dr. Norris Anderson (Gavin McLeod, of ""Mary Tyler Moore"" and ""Love Boat"" fame) disapproves of the work, on grounds of the book's premise that the teachings of Christ can be taught apart from the NAME of Christ. This disturbs Dr. Carlisle, and he resolves to fight the Unanimous rule the Seminary holds for any book endorsement. His efforts are rejected by the Dean of the college, played by Hal Linden (Of ""Barney Miller"" fame). Carlisle avoids Dr. Anderson for a while, despite Anderson's pleas for him to come to his home and discuss the matter. At last, Russell relents and goes to Norris's house, where Norris shows Russell his convenient time machine, located in his barn. (Those things DO come in handy from time to time) Norris rockets Russell more than a hundred years into the future to see the moral deprivation of the age. Russell is blown away by the absence of belief in Jesus in the world, let alone the culture shock of the 21st century. He realizes the terrible mistake he made in thinking God's moral law can be laid down without the authority of God's name behind it, when trying to law down this law and getting only ""Says who?"" in response.GOOD: Obviously, the film is a Christian film, and contains very, very little of what any movie goer might consider bad, unless the wholesome religious themes offend you. The quality of the film underscores the excellent production and effort that went into this movie. The fact that such big names as Gavin McLeod, Jennifer O'Neill and Hal Linden are featured in this film just goes to show you; Some actors can be Christians after all. The music and visual effects are very well done for the mood, especially when you consider that both areas were headed up by professional yet youthful gentlemen.BAD: As much as it pains me to say it, there are several moments where it appears that D. David Morin needs much more acting experience. It is unclear to me whether or not the strange and stoic action is an attempt to display the common character and attitude of the era, but it only serves to appear to me like any other bad actor I've seen. As far as any other objectionable material, there is none. No kid will be frightened by the brief special teleportation effects, I'm sure.THOUGHTS: This movie offers some important insight into the culture of today. Through gradual desensitization, things like nearly nude models in the mall don't bother us any more, or at least most of us. We attend movies that wouldn't be the choice of our Savior, if He were in the theater today. While sending an important message to born-again believers, it also sends the all-important message to non-believers, and doing it in an entertaining way. Purely from a quality standpoint, there are included theatrical trailers, as well as a great 57-minute behind-the-scenes feature.I must give this movie 7  out of ten stars.",5,That was surprisingly GOOD!...,1067040000,"10 25, 2003",2003,3534,"['how', 'would', 'YOU', 'feel', 'meeting', 'throw-forward', '1890', 'how', 'would', 'feel', 'were', 'transported', 'forward', '100', 'years', 'future', 'Time', 'Changer', 'amazing', 'new', 'film', 'directed', 'Christian', 'producer', 'Rich', 'Christiano', 'finally', 'DVD', 'home', 'video', 'movie', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'produced', 'well', 'done', 'film', 'Five', 'amp', 'Two', 'pictures', 'surprisingly', 'big', 'actors', 'featured', 'film.PLOT', 'Dr.', 'Russell', 'Carlisle', 'D.', 'David', 'Morin', 'professor', 'Grace', 'Bible', 'Seminary', 'just', 'completed', 'new', 'book', 'entitled', 'Changing', 'Times', 'secure', 'approval', 'endorsement', 'board', 'directors', 'Seminary', 'However', 'one', 'board', 'member', 'Dr.', 'Norris', 'Anderson', 'Gavin', 'McLeod', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Love', 'Boat', 'fame', 'work', 'grounds', 'book', 'premise', 'teachings', 'Christ', 'can', 'be', 'taught', 'apart', 'NAME', 'Christ', 'disturbs', 'Dr.', 'Carlisle', 'fight', 'Unanimous', 'rule', 'Seminary', 'book', 'endorsement', 'efforts', 'are', 'rejected', 'Dean', 'college', 'played', 'Hal', 'Linden', 'Barney', 'Miller', 'fame', 'Carlisle', 'avoids', 'Dr.', 'Anderson', 'while', 'Anderson', 'pleas', 'come', 'home', 'discuss', 'matter', 'last', 'Russell', 'relents', 'Norris', 'house', 'where', 'Norris', 'Russell', 'convenient', 'time', 'machine', 'located', 'barn', 'things', 'DO', 'come', 'handy', 'time', 'time', 'Norris', 'Russell', 'more', 'hundred', 'years', 'future', 'see', 'moral', 'deprivation', 'age', 'Russell', 'blown', 'away', 'absence', 'belief', 'Jesus', 'world', 'let', 'alone', 'culture', 'shock', '21st', 'century', 'terrible', 'mistake', 'made', 'thinking', 'God', 'moral', 'law', 'can', 'be', 'laid', 'down', 'authority', 'God', 'name', 'when', 'trying', 'law', 'down', 'law', 'getting', 'only', 'Says', 'who', 'response.GOOD', 'Obviously', 'film', 'Christian', 'film', 'very', 'very', 'little', 'what', 'movie', 'goer', 'might', 'consider', 'bad', 'wholesome', 'religious', 'themes', 'offend', 'quality', 'film', 'excellent', 'production', 'effort', 'went', 'movie', 'fact', 'such', 'big', 'names', 'Gavin', 'McLeod', 'Jennifer', ""O'Neill"", 'Hal', 'Linden', 'are', 'featured', 'film', 'just', 'show', 'actors', 'can', 'be', 'Christians', 'music', 'visual', 'effects', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'mood', 'especially', 'when', 'consider', 'areas', 'were', 'headed', 'up', 'professional', 'yet', 'youthful', 'gentlemen.BAD', 'As', 'much', 'say', 'are', 'several', 'moments', 'where', 'D.', 'David', 'Morin', 'much', 'more', 'acting', 'experience', 'unclear', 'not', 'strange', 'stoic', 'action', 'attempt', 'display', 'common', 'character', 'attitude', 'era', 'only', 'appear', 'other', 'bad', 'actor', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'As', 'far', 'other', 'objectionable', 'material', 'none', 'kid', 'will', 'be', 'frightened', 'brief', 'special', 'teleportation', 'effects', ""'m"", 'sure.THOUGHTS', 'movie', 'important', 'insight', 'culture', 'today', 'gradual', 'desensitization', 'things', 'nearly', 'nude', 'models', 'mall', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'more', 'least', 'most', 'attend', 'movies', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'choice', 'Savior', 'were', 'theater', 'today', 'sending', 'important', 'message', 'born-again', 'believers', 'also', 'all-important', 'message', 'non-believers', 'doing', 'entertaining', 'way', 'Purely', 'quality', 'standpoint', 'are', 'included', 'theatrical', 'trailers', 'as', 'well', 'great', '57-minute', 'behind-the-scenes', 'feature.I', 'must', 'give', 'movie', '7', 'ten', 'stars']",N/A
769253,A37X5DFPZAQO22,B0000AZT2U,David,"[24, 46]","As an evangelical Christian, I believe Time Changers had so much potential. The concept of the film reminded of the late '70's film ""Time After Time"" in which both Jack the Ripper and HG Wells are both transported to the present. HG Wells, a secular humanist, is appalled at the violence, sex, and morals of modern day. Jack the Ripper, in contrast, loves the present day, saying in effect, ""I belong here."" While not a Christian film by any stretch, does a much better job contrasting the past to the present.D. David Morin (playing the part of the main character) was simply painful to watch; what was director Rich Christiano thinking casting him for the role? The other actors were fine for this kind of film, which otherwise had a ""made for TV"" feel to it.More importantly, the sins of society of the 1890's (child labor, institutionalized racism, graft, corruption, 3rd world conditions for American workers) were completely ignored ... and the sins of the present seemed focused solely on sex, divorce, and taking God's name in vain. Is God concerned with righteousness? You bet, but He's also concerned with justice. For a taste of what life was really like 116 years ago, read any of the speeches of William Jennings Bryan (3 time Democratic candidate for President), or Republican President Theodore Roosevelt.Rather than the film causing those who are not Christians to walk away with something significant to ponder and think about, it ended up sermonizing and preaching to the choir.I've read all the reviews and my apologies to non-Christians who were led to believe this was a ""science fiction"" film. It should have been listed as a ""relgious"" or ""Christian"" film. It had a lot of potential ... kinda sad. To paraphrase Larry Norman ""why does the devil have all the good movies?""Actually, he doesn't. ""To End All Wars"" (rated R for extreme wartime violence) stars Robert Carlye and Kiefer Sutherland is an excellent film - and is based on a true story of the lives of Christians and non-Christians in a Japanese POW camp in WWII.

I have my own values and I don't think anyone should force me to change them.  Matter of fact, I saw this out of a recommendation by someone because I was looking for 'questionable' films.  ""Time Changer"" is definitely questionable, but I'm watching this film by its own merits, and to be fair, I was pleasantly entertained with it...for the wrong reasons.D. David Morin plays Russell, a bible scholar from the year 1890 who gave a transcript to his other scholars about using the teachings of Jesus without using his name.  He was then rebuked by Dr. Norris, played by Gavin MacLeod, saying that without enforcing the name Jesus in the teachings, the community will be lost in the fields.  The reverend doctor privately proved to Russell by showing a time machine, which Russell reluctantly gawked but decided to join in, sending him into our present to discover what HE thinks is the last days of humanity.  Throughout this bizarre turn of events which question if this religion even accept such a method as a time machine, all I can think about was ""what's wrong with teaching good Christian values without mentioning Jesus?  Isn't it important to teach the faith-goers about how to be a decent person to the world?""Russell is a peculiar character.  In the future (our present time), he goes around preaching the ways of The Lord, eavesdropping and interrupting other people's business, and outspokenly critical about certain aspects of contemporary society.  I find him to be rude, condescending, incapable of keeping things to himself...and hilarious. D. David Morin does a wonderful job at expressing confusion during the time travel experience, he had a doe-eyed face that stayed the same for most of the film, especially when's he facing what I would jokingly call obstacles.  The character was chasing a girl who stole a hot dog and he ran like he's squatting the whole way, his glare of disgust over women's 'sinful' apparels, the way he abrasively barged out of the theater and complained to the workers because a movie character used God's name in vain, the actor really phoned it in.  I wasn't sure if those goofy moments were intentional, but considering how passionate the director was in the Special Message feature, the movie was probably taken very seriously, which made the film even more funny.I would like to think the whole lesson of the film was to never forgot who taught the values that are necessary to live a good life, but since the real lesson was 'if you fear people into being good by saying Jesus judges them', then it becomes bureaucracy at work; actually, the ending is quite disturbing if Russell manages to alter time to his own accord.

The alleged 'God', which created Everything, shows a remarkable lack of knowledge about its/his/her own creation.

769269,A32CG0V371FRQ2,B0000AZT2U,GratedTopping,"[1, 1]","I enjoyed the idea and the music score was great in this spiritual film from ""Five & Two Pictures"". The director mentions in the commentary that this relates to the five loaves of bread and two fish that Jesus used to feed many people as stated in the New Testament. The director had wanted his films to reach many in the same way.This commentary with the writer/director + the leading star, Mr. Morin, is fast-paced & informative with dialogue about the shooting schedule, location findings, info about the actors, how it was difficult to light certain places, how some shots where you think two people were talking to one another might not actually have been so, and other interesting parts about movie making and how everything was done in a &lt;$1 million picture.I always like time travel movie or stories and this is one of them. D. David Morin is the leading character, Russell Carlisle. Gavin MacLeod, Richard Riehle, and Hal Linden are all fine in their roles as other professors at a Bible college in the 1890's.A professor from the past is about to have a book called ""The Changing Times"" published and is seeking endorsment of the Bible college he's at. One of the other professors disagrees with what the book is implying and believes that you shouldn't have the teaching without the teacher. That good morals and good behaviour are fine, but that it can lead to people just believing that this is what would allow a person to become closer to God and forgiven of sins. He feels that it should always be identified that it's Jesus Christ's sacrifice that allows us to get right with God and that nobody can 'work' their way into heaven. He doesn't want to endorse the book and a unanimous decision is required. To explain more about why he feels as he does, Gavin's character wants to show Carlisle the future -- which he's already seen by means of his a time machine.It took a while for the actual time travel part to begin, but that's alright. It sets up more of the tale and I liked checking out the style of the 1800's. The look of the time machine is cool. Not extremely fancy but it seemed appropriate as one would expect such a device in the time period. It's neat to hear Gavin's character talking a bit about how it worked; his instructions to Carlisle about how he should not look up how he passed away; and the reasons why he wasn't able to bring something back from the future. His reasoning was that it wouldn't have been invented yet in that year in the past.There were funny bits, too, like when Gavin's character gave some money to exchange and told Carlisle that ""You will simply not believe the price of merchandise."" When Carlisle takes that money to to a future pawn shop, the guy in the shop accepting the old coins is cool. Carlisle says his thanks for treating him in a 'such a fair an Christian manner'. The guy turns around, looks at another guy, and says ""Sure..."" with a smile.In a department store, where Carlisle wants newer clothes, he is not pleased with the display of lingerie and is told he's the first one to even say such a thing. Of course, I know I never said anything like that because I would know that it wouldn't have gotten anywhere anyway. But to come from a just over a hundred years in the past, I would have been surprised as well.He learns that stealing is still common like he encountered in his time. It was funny to see him chase this girl who stole his food; he wanted to run after her, but was so 'proper' that he wanted to run in a dignified manner.Something more surprising to him os when a doorman was talking to Carlisle, this woman walks by and the doorman says without hesitation some words similar to ""You're lookin' fine. I get off at 9."" and the guy tells him that he's divorced and thas mant more marriages end in divorce. There was plenty of bad characters over time, of course, but you'll get the idea: that as time passes, it seems that many people get more and more into themselves.To me, I admit, the main character was not as effective as I had hoped. The best parts to me were when he was speaking with the dean and when he was at his home with his wife, where he was obviously thinking about his writing and the posibility of going to the future. I liked his long speech in the church later which, as the commentary stated, was fully memorized. I did want him toThe very end was awesome to me and this is a spoiler: Gavin's character started to try to send an object into the year 2100 -- but it went nowhere because there was no such year, which implies that the earth is gone/changed. He then proceeded to set the machine back 10 years at a time and the movie ended. At what year will he learn that mankind will be changed and Christ will have returned? He's surprised as he realizes more and more that there is not much more time.Other thoughts:- Shame on those two detectives who apparently are Christians at the same church Mr. Carlisle attended. They break into Russell's hotel room while he's out and harass him when they are around him. They are curious as to why he's around when they discover that a Mr. Russell Carlisle who was a professor had died in the 1930's. Carlisle has done nothing wrong and I didn't like this, but there is usually an 'enemy' or something on the side of 'evil' in any movie.Near the end, they get to witness Carlisle returning to the past and it was interesting to hear them say ""I think we've missed the rapture."" Which implies that they are folks who went to church but were not really saved after all. Going to church and behaving kindly is never bad -- but is never enough to save your soul.- When Carlisle was speaking before a classroom, like he had in the past, but the teacher told him that there were no religious views to be expressed in the school, he was astonished.I am glad that things were mentioned to me regardless when I was in school in the 1980's/early 1990's. That's not far from when Carlisle arrived in the future, which was 2000. For me, in one class, I admit that I had actually worn a 'magical' talisman & was thinking that it was some sorta good luck charm. The first time I wore it, the homeroom's substitute teacher -- there for just a day -- told me about it and what the symbols meant and even invited me to church if I wanted to go. I did; I ended up destroying the talisman; and I got more friends, including the knowlege of how I was a special person. The amulet was actually to help me attract friends; I was a lonely kid and so, ultimately, the amulet 'worked' -- but it was the teacher that helped and God, who used something negative for His glory.In later high school, my science teacher told me of how they had a lil' Bible study at lunch time for just a few minutes and I went to that right in the school in his classroom. Very nice and nothing wrong with that.- It had a some funny moments, looked and sounded great, talked about Jesus, and dealt with time travel. A well-made movie that a parent doesn't have to screen first.- Something that might get you to think about eternity and spiritual matters is exciting. Even though the movie is about how being good is not enough to appease God (which is stated in the Biblical text as well) and you don't believe, perhaps someone might still start thinking that they don't like the way they are behaving. If you ever feel from a movie ""You know, I've been like that person and it's not how I would want to be."", that's different. Can you really name a bunch of films that got you annoyed at the behaviour of others in it? Carlisle is so surprised by the way things are in present day and it's shocking to him.You can be a personal time changer. Jesus makes us right with God and that's cool, so why not think about it and alter your eternity?",3,you can be a time changer!,1277596800,"06 27, 2010",2010,7752,"['enjoyed', 'idea', 'music',

But if you're like I am, and you liked ""The Time Machine,"" this is a nice addition to this genre.Dating back to 1890, we have a professor (D. David Morin) who wants to get a book published, and he needs a complete unanimous decision by the Grace Chapel School of Theology.  There's only problem, however, Dr. Anderson (Gavin Macleod) doesn't want to promote the book because of a portion of the book which deals with just promoting ""moral values"" without the authority of Christ.This is an intriguing idea, and Dr. Anderson finally sways Dr. Carlisle (Morin) to visit him at his home so he can persuade him, only he sends him on a ""journey"" to the year 2000, where he sees where his ideas will ultimately end up - in total disaster.This was a marvelous piece of film making, and it provided a change from such movies of the past, by not showing how bad the society had changed in 110 years in the future.  This was very encouraging.  We could all surmise what Dr. Carlisle discovered.  Also, there was a great liking for his character, and a sadness which he encountered, especially with ""professed Christians"" who apparently denied the power of Christ by the way they lived their lives and accomodated the culture around them.A highly recommended film, and a wake-up call to Christians and those outside the faith.  Make sure of your commitment to Christ, because He is coming soon, and He will only take those who have truly repented of their sins and have received Him by faith into their lives!!!Jennifer O'Neill has a really nice part as a librarian at a local college, and he not only helps Dr. Carlisle, but Dr. Anderson before him.

Christian believers are described in the Bible as ""pilgrims"", passing through this world to the next. This emphasizes that in an unusual way.The main character is a Bible professor from 1890 and with a time machine is able to view our modern time. The film not only amuses us with the typical shock of him experiencing modern appliances and automobiles, but also shows the shock of him dealing with the casual way in which our generation views sin. Because modern believers are constantly confronted with blatant sin, we have grown calloused to it.  A believer from 1890 would not have had that experience, so you could imagine how shocked he would be seeing and hearing the blasphemy and immorality that surrounds us today.The main lesson is brought out quite clearly - that our failure to be precise in what appears to be a small issue today may have grave consequences in the future.

So many of them are epic end times movies (how many times have I seen ""Joe, what is this, some sort of code on the Antichrist's computer, it says E.Z. 38?""  ""Wait!  I just happened to notice that there is a Bible open to Ezekiel 38 and it's talking about a military invasion!""  As if the Antichrist would use a reference from the Bible as his secret code...  ""Thief in the Night"" even today outdoes these modern end times films in the storytelling department).  Those that aren't silly end times stories are usually some sort of story about someone who overcomes great odds (nothing against those stories, but I don't usually want to spend my Friday nights wathing them), or hammers the film's message so hard that you aren't really sure if there was a story there.  [EDIT: Facing the Giants is one of those films, but is by far the best Christian movie I have ever seen, and even rates in one of the top movies I have seen period.  See my review over there for more info.]Time Changer is a different breed.  First of all, it's a science fiction film.  Sci-Fi and Christian!  What a concept!  (Much like Spy Corps - a Christian spy film, although Spy Corps is definitely a kid's film vs. Time Changer which is clearly for adults.  If you haven't seen that one, you should check it out.)  The production value in this film is excellent, and the story is very good.  I only have one complaint about it - the film takes a somewhat boring detour as it has a character explain the message of the film (which is shown quite brilliantly, although I'm not in 100% agreement with it), which caused it to drag in the middle (and causes it to fall in the third issue I have with Christian films above).  Take that one character out and this film would get 5 stars.

It's more like I was convicted by it. My family watched it and my seventeen year old watched it twice after that. She said it made her really think about if she was obeying God's word (she really did say this).The movie is not perfect, but it points out to us that our society has CHANGED in relationship to the things of God. The point it brought home to me was this; we can try to regulate morality through laws and ordinances, but without the ""I [am] the LORD thy God, ........Thou shalt not....."" there, the question will always be 'Why should I?' As the man pointed out to the little boy who stole the marbles, stealing is wrong because God said it is so.There used to be a time in America when some things that the movie pointed out, (blasphemy, unmarried couples kissing, kids watching it with the approval of their parents), would not be accepted because people knew it was contrary to the Bible. I'm not saying that people back then were perfect, of course they were not and haven't been since Adam and Eve. But there was a time when God's name had much more honor in America and the world then it does now.Now people are all about pleasing themselves and society caters to it. ""If it feels good do it."" What about honoring the God of this universe and following his commands? He made this world and knows best how to take care of it ....and the people in it. He gave His commandments for a reason. The movie points this out. Why should we do right? Not just because it's moral, but because Father says to do it.Like the movie points out, if we take the bible out of the reason why.....we have the type of society that we have today. Morals only last until.... well as I heard someone say once, 'That's your truth, not mine.' Everybody will have their own list of right and wrong.Fast forward to the future and this is what we have as the movie points out. Christ has been taken out of the home (most important), school, workplace, and in some places even the Church. So many churches seem to be all about the numbers, just like the man who was 'witnessing' to the couple. Let's offer whatever we can to get them to church. I heard someone say, ""It's like a Six Flags over Jesus."" Yet we think as long as we are good and regulate people by man's laws it will all work out okay. It will not.I know some people gave this movie bad reviews. Maybe they didn't see what I see, but that's okay. As long as they CAN see what the scripture says and obey it.

However I must say that this movie, apart from the fact of being extremely well done with excellent soundtrack, acting and dialogue, really made a mark on my overall views of our society which I must say really seems to be heading for absolute chaos in the future (not so distant perhaps....). It seems to be that each generation being born is more and more unstable and socially disordered and this trand can only lead to a severe crack of our social unity and standards. Again, I am not much of a religious person but this movie makes me feel that perhaps I should be more of that, because science alone seems unable to answer the deepest universal questions which stands at the core of our very own existance and consciousness. Perhaps the only gripe with this film is the strict christian outlook which excludes other religions points of view (althought all religions have the same end result which is love, that is; unity.....).

It deals with two primary topics: 1-it deals with the authority of Jesus Christ and 2: Eternity. These two issues are extremely important and cannot be ignored.Plot: A bible professor-Dr. Russell Carslie has written a book called &quot;The changing times&quot; and he is seeking endorsement from the Grace Bible Seminary board of directors where he teaches before the book is published. Since everyone must give their approval of the manuscript-or no endearment by the board. All is well until Dr. Norris Anderson shows up and raises an objection to one item in the book. He believes that teaching morals alone-without the authority of Jesus Christ will lead many astray.At first, Dr. Carlisle is as bull headed as they come-refusing to understand or accept what Dr. Anderson's is trying to say. Eventually, he goes to Norrris' Home where he shows Carlisle a time machine that his father built before he died. Carlisle laughs at first-but he realizes that they need to settle the issue. He is then transported in to the future-110 years to be exact.He then sees the folly of his beliefs. He meets several people. Most of them have a shallow view of life. Even those in the church are ignorant of the truth of Christ. For example, he goes to a movie with a group from the church-and he is the only one who is bothered by the fact that a character on the screen is using the name of Christ in Vain. Every one else just say that &quot;It's only a movie&quot;This movie DOES NOT paint a rosy picture of the past. At the board meeting, Norris points out that over 5% of marriages end in divorce(1890 numbers). When Carlisle is in the future-he learns that 50% of all marriages end in divorce. This is only one example.Another reviewer accuses the producers of deceiving him for not informing him that this is a Christian film. If you look on the back of the case-there's a description of the film. It says plainly that it's about a bible professor who is sent into more than 100 years into the future. If that does not tell you that that this is a Christian film-then I don't know what will. There was no attempt by the producers to deceive anyone.This is a timely film with an important message.

It's a mixture in the genre of Christian, sci-fi and drama. In the year 1890 a Bible professor, Russell Carlisle (D. David Morin) has written a new manuscript, ""The Changing Times."" Carlisle's book is about to be unanimously endorsed from the Grace Bible Seminary board until his colleague Dr. Norris Anderson (Gavin MacLeod) raises an objection. If we remove Jesus' authority. There are no standard of living. Satan's goal is to remove Jesus Christ from human morality from all aspects of life. Dr. Anderson believes that what Carlisle has written could greatly affect the future of coming generations. Anderson persistance of a sceptical Carlisle journey into the future pays off. Using a secret time machine, Anderson transports Carlisle over 100 years into the future to the year 2002.In the future, Carlisle is offered a glimpse of where his beliefs will lead. Once Carlisle enterd into our present time, he experiences things that shock and dismay him. He meets Eddie Martinez (Paul Rodriquez), a good guy who says it's all he needs to get by. Carlisle quickly learn the way of modern society. He visits a modern day church and witnesses it's new doctrine of teaching. Carlisle also visits the University Library on the advisory of Dr. Anderson to meet and tlak with Michelle Bain (Jennifer O'Neill). His meeting with her is an eye-opener. In the meantime he meets with some other interested parties while attending a movie at a local theater. During their conversation, Carlisle gives these two fellows some lead about his past and a clue that send them in an investigative trail about Carlisle's mysterious origins. Back at the University Library, he lectures to a class and relates Dr. Anderson's teachings in relation to Jesus Christ. The teacher rebuts Carlisle and tells him that his lecture on religion is not allowed. With Carlisle's disappointed it was worser than he could imagine.Carlisle has another meeting with Michelle Bain while back in his room the undercover men break in to find his bible dated 1865. In his discussion with Ms. Bain, she tells him society's not built on biblical principles anymore (based on the ruling of the Supreme Court of 1962 ending school prayer). A sign of the times. People rely on their own goodness that can't save them. In relation to her own life, Bain had success but emptiness. She found God is patient. Her work at the library gave her a chance to tell people about Christ. Secular entertainment is the biggest tool Satan uses to mislead people. He desensitizes us through profanity, violence and sexual immorality. Even with cleaner morals, Satan is the deceptor who kept Jesus Christ from society. The fear of God is beginning of wisdom and if we don't what can we expect. A prayerful Carlisle sees his wrong. On his last night he's asked to speak at a church meeting. He shares with these people some matters of the heart. Matters of culture different from theirs. The lifestyle he observed was startling. He quotes from 2 Timothy 3:1-5. Society is blanant and open as much as in the days of Noah. Through his own fault we try to reform the teachings of the Lord without the Lord  of the teachings. Jesus died for our sins. Our eternity depends on it. Society will go through troubled times. Carlisle leaves them in silence. He says goodbye to Eddie and gives him a bible and Christ's message. He hurries to the designated place of return. The men who had been following him show up. They're in for the surprise of their lives! He vanishes in the speed of light. Carlisle is back in 1890. He tells Dr. Anderson he was wrong in his thinking. Without Christ people are lost. Could he have witnessed the last days? Carlisle presented his new manuscript to the Seminary Board called ""Time Changer."" Time must change or time as we know it will end. Over 1900 years ago Christ came to save us and complete the task of salvation. How far could one go into the future to witness the last days? 2090-2080-2070-2060-? The future is in God's hands.

David Morin as Dr. Russell Carlisle, a professor at a Christian college in the 1890s.  He is ready to publish a book and seeks the endorsement of his school's faculty.  Although most of the board members are willing to do so, one will not, and the policy requires unanimity prior to the endorsement.The lone holdout is Dr. Norris Anderson.  His objection centers around one small part of the book where Carlisle supports the idea that Biblical morality should be taught to all without tying it into the words of Jesus Christ.  While Carlisle argues that society would be better off if everyone would follow the prohibitions outlined in Scripture, Anderson thinks not.  He says that if these teachings are separated from the authority, people will be worse off.Anderson wants to show Carlisle the end result of his idea and he has a way to do it.  He happens to be in possession of a time machine and offers to transport his colleague to the early 21st century.This is very well done.  It raises several important points and does so in a fun way.  It is one that I would recommend to Christians and non-Christians alike.

769308,A1RD2TSQ2IE5LW,B0000AZT2U,Steven Sabin,"[1, 3]","Writing a review that says ""I loved it"" or ""I hated it"" is easy.  I'd be done by now if that's all there was to say.  But I'm assuming people read reviews to get a little more depth than just thumbs up or thumbs down.  And since this film had a bit of both, so will my review.First, the message of the film:  Outstanding.Times have changed, but not for the better.  Christians long for a simpler era not because we are nave, but because we instinctively understand that as The Day approaches, evil waxes worse and worse.  How bad is it?  By juxtaposing 1890 against 2007 as this film does, we begin to get a clue.  That proverbial frog in the pot has reached a full boil and we've barely noticed.Next, the inventiveness of the story.  Time travel is always an appealing topic because what one of us hasn't wondered or wished it could really happen?  There was a slight Jules Verne feel to the whole thing.  My son thought it looked like the computer game ""Myst"" and I had to agree.Third, the filmmakers didn't pull any punches here.  There was no attempt to water down the message to make it palatable.  We were asked to eat our veggies here a la natural, not slathered with creme sauce and butter.  I admired that.However, for its good points, there were at least an equal number of areas where I felt this film needed some major improvements.First, the science was, uh, hokey.  A 30-minute consult with a real physicist or post-grad student would have been time well-spent in terms of getting some more authentic terminology and ideas.  Remember, Einstein's work was barely 20 years away in the 1890s and he was building on some of the ideas of others - ideas that were around in the 1890s.  Some of that time/space/gravity/matter/energy continuum could have come through a little more credibly than just a few mumbled words about sunlight and singularities.  People will willingly suspend disbelief at the movies.  But you shouldn't make it quite so hard for them to do so.  Christopher Reeve's mind-over-matter time travel in the movie ""Somewhere in Time"" was frankly more believable, and dealt with a similar transition of crossing a century - but he went the other direction.  Something like that ""mental bending of time"" might actually have worked better here.Second, the production quality.  It was OK, but lacking attention to detail that makes the real difference between mediocre and outstanding.  The alleys were too clean, the bad elements of the city too sanitized, and the degree to which society had sunk relied too much on contrived scenes and dialog rather than just reality.Which brings me to the third point: the writing.  Just making Dr. Carlisle a silent observer through the whole movie rather than always having to verbalize what he was seeing would have been more powerful.  It's too bad because the writer had a fantastic story to tell.  He just let words get in the way too often.  Frankly, it insults the intelligence of the viewer when everything has to be spelled out verbally like a series of billboards along the freeway.Here's what I mean:  Some of the older readers of this review might remember a public service commercial that ran on TV about 25 years ago.  An Indian paddles up a metropolitan river in his canoe, dressed in his traditional buckskin clothing with a long black braid.  From the context it is clear that he is in some kind of time warp.  He surveys the land and instead of seeing the pristine beauty that he recalls, he sees smokestacks belching pollution, water covered with oily film, garbage everywhere, and industrial sprawl.  He never says a word through the whole thing.  He just paddles and turns to the camera at the end of the 30 second spot where we see a single, large tear running down his cheek.Less is more.No words were necessary to convey that message.  And 25 years later, I still remember it.That's what this film was missing in my opinion.  It tried to tell with words what wouldn't have been necessary had the story been better written to let our main character simply observe and convey with his body language what he was experiencing rather than having to verbally explain everything.  All that pent up realization could have been brought out powerfully during his mini-sermon at the end, rather than at each step of the journey.  The filmmaker here tried to do double duty as a screenwriter.  I think it would have worked better to get a real screenwriter to adapt the story and to know when silence would have spoken louder than words.  The problem wasn't in the fundamental story idea.  It was simply in the execution.Third, I really had a hard time with the believability of the main character here.  I understand that the turn-of-the-twentieth-century man or woman was going to be far more prim and proper in their use of language than we modern schleps.  But there was just something here that didn't ring authentic for me.  Gavin MacLeod's character, yes.  D. David Morin's character -- no.  The speech and the cadence just didn't sound natural.  In fact, before I realized that Dr. Carlisle was the main character, I thought that perhaps this was a bit part in the movie being played by someone who had never done much acting before  -- kind of like Frank Peretti taking small roles in some of the movies where he's been the screenwriter.Did I like the film?  Yes.  It made me think and reflect.  The message was valid and much-needed.  But it wasn't told as masterfully as it could have been, and this just isn't the kind of movie that is going to see much screen time outside church movie nights and folks who buy movies at the Christian bookstore.  If that's the audience the filmmaker was aiming for, then OK.  But if this film was meant to be some kind of message to non-believers, that just isn't likely to happen.It's too bad a movie like this couldn't have been told with the same skill and production quality that Mel Gibson was able to deliver in The Passion.  This message was just as important, as it told us not just what a culture in decline looks like, but why it happened.  Unfortunately, what came across here was at about the level I'd expect from a community theatre production.  Good, but just not quite ready for the major leagues.",3,"Great message, not-so-great delivery",1205798400,"03 18, 2008",2008,6233,"['Writing', 'review', 'loved', 'hated', 'easy', ""'d"", 'be',

He reads lines like &quot;Why does he cause me pain?&quot; without showing any expression at all.Some scenes play like sermons where more human interaction could've made them more effective.  In the final scene between the lead character and Eddie (Rodriquez's character), it might have played deeper if Carlisle allowed more of his humility to show.  Defeated by his own pompous ambitions in the past, he could hint at his desperation to get the word out to just one person, even if it's the guy who manages an inner-city laundrymat.More tension could've been explored if the two guys investigating Carlisle had happened on a photo of him in their research (their final scene is a hoot though).I'm not sure if the filmmakers wanted to go there, but some genuinely funny scenes of Carlisle experiencing modern culture (rap music, teen fashions, MTV) could've been added.  I'm not sure if I was supposed to laugh, but I did find some amusement at Carlisle freaking out at the movie theatre and jumping in front of a TV to keep a child from seeing a couple kissing on TV.  Wouldn't it have been funny to see him yelling at the couple on the TV, thinking they were in a window?&quot;Now, come out of there and control yourselves!&quot;Maybe they just wanted to keep their Christian audience instead of possibly offending them.  The scene where Jennifer O'Neill explains how her character (or the filmmakers, for that matter) believe that films have become decadent illustrates their dilemma, perhaps.I'm not suggesting that these filmmakers &quot;muddy&quot; things up more to please a secular audience, but I am hoping for spiritual films in the future that challenges both Christian and secular audiences.

769314,A1C80B497LCYKA,B0000AZT2U,"Waitsel Smith ""Movie Shark""","[8, 15]","I am really amazed by the reviews of this movie. People seem either to love it or hate it, based on whether or not they agree with the theology. But in all the discussion about theology, the movie itself seems to have gotten lost. What, really, is Rich Christiano, the director, trying to say, and how well does he say it?Just to add my two cents, briefly, to the theological discussion, from a Reformed theological viewpoint, Rich is right on in his premise: you cannot separate Jesus Christ from his teachings. It won't work. Either Jesus is Lord over every part of our lives, including our morality, or He's not Lord over any of it. But is film really the right forum, the right medium, in which to discuss such an issue? Isn't the purpose of film to tell a story?The story in Time Changer is about a 19th century seminary professor named Russell Carlisle, played by D. David Morin, who has written a thesis in which he tries to prove that you CAN separate Jesus from His teachings and still end up with a morally sound society. Another professor named Norris Anderson, played by Gavin MacLeod, is deeply disturbed by this, and sets out to disprove Carlisle's theory by sending him to the future in a time machine invented by his father. In doing this, he hopes to show Carlisle the morally corrupting effect his book will have on society, and thereby convince him to change it.Now, in theory, Rich Christiano has a good idea. But, in practice, it doesn't work. Why? Because storytelling is about character, plot, crisis, climax and resolution - not about proving a thesis. Rich's main character, Professor Carlisle, is a dislikable, inflexible, self-focused person who starts out relatively one-dimensional and remains so throughout the film. He lives in a world that is pretty much one-dimensional as well, filled with other one-dimensional people. It is interesting that Rich chose not to use any slang or other idioms that would have given color and dimensionality to his characters, when the 19th century was full of them, as indicated by the writings of Mark Twain and others. Instead, his language is stiff and formal, his characters are colorless, and there is very little relationally between them, even with Carlisle and his wife. Who are these people and why should we care about them? We never find out.Then, off Professor Carlisle goes into an equally one-dimensional, 20th century world, where people are ignorant of spiritual matters, all churches are worldly, and morality is a thing of the past. There, Carlisle interacts with the ignorant people and worldly church members, and is shocked by the lack of morality. But he never really gets involved with these people - not really. He soon realizes that Professor Anderson was right, and off he goes back to the 19th century to change his book and, thereby, change history.All well and good; but, do I care? I want to. But Rich Christiano has created a film in which it is very difficult to care, about any one or any thing - except his thesis. We cannot care about his one-dimensional professor or his one-dimensional world - they're not real. In his quest to prove his point, Rich has failed to engage us in his characters or to move us to care about what happens to them, and that is the biggest part of good storytelling.There are Christian films that do have wonderful stories and characters that have been fleshed out: Ben-Hur and Chariots of Fire are two outstanding examples. Those movies are worthy of five stars. An example of a Christian film in the same league as Time Changer, but more successful because of story and character development, is Joshua. Even though Time Changer is a good production with a noble goal, it fails to be a significant film because it forgets the most fundamental purpose of filmmaking: to tell a good story.Waitsel Smith",3,WHAT ABOUT STORY?,1127952000,"09 29, 2005",2005,3830,"['am', 'really', 'amazed', 'reviews', 'movie', 'People', 'seem', 'love', 'hate', 'based', 'not', 'agree', 'theology', 'discussion', 'theology', 'movie', 'have', 'gotten', 'lost', 'What', 'really', 'Rich', 'Christiano', 'director', 'trying', 'say', 'how', 'well', 'say', 'Just', 'add', 'two', 'cents', 'briefly', 'theological', 'discussion', 'Reformed', 'theological', 'viewpoint', 'Rich', 'right', 'premise', 'can', 'not', 'separate', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'teachings', 'wo', ""n't"", 'work', 'Jesus', 'Lord', 'part', 'lives', 'including', 'morality', 'not', 'Lord', 'film', 'really', 'right', 'forum', 'right', 'medium', 'discuss', 'issue', ""n't"", 'purpose', 'film', 'tell', 'story', 'story', 'Time', 'Changer', '19th', 'century', 'seminary', 'professor', 'named', 'Russell', 'Carlisle', 'played', 'D.', 'David', 'Morin', 'who', 'written', 'thesis', 'prove', 'CAN', 'separate', 'Jesus', 'teachings', 'still', 'end', 'up', 'morally', 'sound', 'society', 'professor', 'named', 'Norris', 'Anderson', 'played', 'Gavin', 'MacLeod', 'deeply', 'disturbed', 'out', 'disprove', 'Carlisle', 'theory', 'sending', 'future', 'time', 'machine', 'invented', 'father', 'doing', 'show', 'Carlisle', 'morally', 'corrupting', 'effect', 'book', 'will', 'have', 'society', 'thereby', 'convince', 'change', 'it.Now', 'theory', 'Rich', 'Christiano', 'good', 'idea', 'practice', ""n't"", 'work', 'Why', 'storytelling', 'character', 'plot', 'crisis', 'climax', 'resolution', 'not', 'proving', 'thesis', 'Rich', 'main', 'character', 'Professor', 'Carlisle', 'dislikable', 'inflexible', 'self-focused', 'person', 'who', 'out', 'relatively', 'one-dimensional', 'so', 'film', 'world', 'pretty', 'much', 'one-dimensional', 'well', 'filled', 'other', 'one-dimensional', 'people', 'interesting', 'Rich', 'chose', 'not', 'use', 'slang', 'other', 'idioms', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'color', 'dimensionality', 'characters', 'when', '19th', 'century', 'was', 'full', 'indicated', 'writings', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'others', 'Instead', 'language', 'stiff', 'formal', 'characters', 'are', 'colorless', 'very', 'little', 'relationally', 'even', 'Carlisle', 'wife', 'Who', 'are', 'people', 'why', 'should', 'care', 'never', 'find', 'out.Then', 'off', 'Professor', 'Carlisle', 'equally', 'one-dimensional', '20th', 'century', 'world', 'where', 'people', 'are', 'ignorant', 'spiritual', 'matters', 'churches', 'are', 'worldly', 'morality', 'thing', 'past', 'Carlisle', 'ignorant', 'people', 'worldly', 'church', 'members', 'shocked', 'lack', 'morality', 'never', 'really', 'involved', 'people', 'not', 'really', 'soon', 'Professor', 'Anderson', 'was', 'right', 'back', '19th', 'century', 'change', 'book', 'thereby', 'change', 'history.All', 'well', 'good', 'do', 'care', 'want', 'Rich', 'Christiano', 'created', 'film', 'very', 'difficult', 'care', 'one', 'thing', 'thesis', 'can', 'not', 'care', 'one-dimensional', 'professor', 'one-dimensional', 'world', ""'re"", 'not', 'real', 'quest', 'prove', 'point', 'Rich', 'failed', 'engage', 'characters', 'move', 'care', 'what', 'biggest', 'part', 'good', 'storytelling.There', 'are', 'Christian', 'films', 'do', 'have', 'wonderful', 'stories', 'characters', 'have', 'been', 'fleshed', 'out', 'Ben-Hur', 'Chariots', 'Fire', 'are', 'two', 'outstanding', 'examples', 'movies', 'are', 'worthy', 'five', 'stars', 'example', 'Christian', 'film', 'same', 'league', 'Time', 'Changer', 'more', 'successful', 'story', 'character', 'development', 'Joshua', 'Even', 'Time', 'Changer', 'good', 'production', 'noble', 'goal', 'be', 'significant', 'film', 'most', 'fundamental', 'purpose', 'filmmaking', 'tell', 'good', 'story.Waitsel', 'Smith']",N/A
