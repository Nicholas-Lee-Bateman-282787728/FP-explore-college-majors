This movie vastly presents itself as a whimsical almost light-hearted morality tale for youngsters, but there are definitely a half a dozen scenes so different as to be glaringly out of place, if not downright unsuitable for young children.  For instance, in one scene the father thinks the boy is lying and begins to whip him with escalating frustration, to the point of being what in this country would definitively be called abuse.  I was so stunned by this scene that I thought for a moment that the movie must have skipped to an ""extra features"" section.  Then there is the boy stabbing his toy.  The point here is not that children never project their frustration through acting out violently.  The point here is that this movie is so predominantly a child oriented fantasy that this scene of violence is completely out of place.  There are several other scenes that fall into this category.I like some of Steven Chow's other movie's (I'm a huge fan of Kung Fu Hustle).  And though there are many things I liked about this film, its construction seems poor compared to his previous work.

What in the world would possess me to pick up CJ7? Well, someone very dear to me asked me if I had seen it. Seeing as I hadn't, I said no. Then, they went on to tell me what it was about. A movie about a man who desperately struggles to keep his son fed, clothed, and educated despite his struggle to stay employed. When his son asks for a toy that he can't afford, he sets out to find a suitable substitute that's cheaper(i.e. that doesn't cost anything). He returns from the garbage with CJ7, who is no more than a green ball at first. When his son activates this new ball, his son discovers that his new toy is much more than a toy but a magical solution to his family's struggles. Needless to say, I still wasn't sold on it so they went and rented it out. We watched it and, I got to admit, it is one of the best Asian films I've seen in awhile.  I ended up purchasing it for my very own. It is one of the most hilarious, imaginative, and smart films to come out in quite a long time. Definitely one I'd recommend for families to watch.However, be forwarned-parents, there are a few scenes that you might want to see first before letting your kids watch that involve..um, how can we say this...poo. They're not that offensive, mind you. In fact, they are downright funny. Yet, in all fairness, you might want to scope the scenes out before letting them watch. Chow's movies, as you may have seen before with Kung Fu Hustle, are not immediately for everyone.DVD features include: ""The Story of CJ7 "" - A behind the scenes look at the making of the film, Anatomy of a Scene"" - an in-depth look at how a scene with the adorable ""CJ7"" was shot, ""How to Bully a Bully"" - A lesson on how to stand your own ground against the school bully, ""Make Your Own Giant Lollipop"" - A how-to on making your very own lollipop prop,""The Making of CJ7"" International Television Special - A more technical behind the scenes look at the making of the film and visual effects, CJ7 Mission Control Game - See how far you can launch ""CJ7"" into space!, CJ7 Profiles - Learn more about your favorite CJ7 characters!, and Cast and Crew commentary.CJ7 is, literally, the star of the movie. He's Asian's version of ET. Again, I highly recommend this movie to all.

After reading them, I suspected that this film contained something completely awful.  Such was not the case... though it does deal with themes that are a little mature I wouldn't say that this film is for the entire family and that is it's misconception.  The film is geared more towards adolecents and adults more so than children.  the film is quiky and what you would expect from Chow.  but it's humor is somewhat dark at times.  Either way, should you sit your 8 year old next to you and view the film? I would say it's probably not the best idea.  but it is worth watching for yourself.

1170555,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B001B4SYDE,"Cloud ""...""","[2, 7]","While I don't always get to see the wide range of movies thanks to shoddy stores, I've always loved many of the films that come from Asia from the horror of Ringu and Ju-On to animated ones like Millennium Actress or the quirky awesomeness of the Host. So I like to check out films that most otherwise would bypass but I've heard of Stephen Chow and his films ""Kung Fu Hustle"" and ""Shaolin Soccer"" but never have actually seen them but when his new film, a family film called ""CJ7"" was out, I thought I'd check it out. Ultimately what I got was a cute and time-tested idea ruined by some bad script decisions and humor.Ti is a hard-working man with a job at the construction site but he's so poor that he has to work extra hours just to buy an electric fan and good luck finding decent food as well. His son Dicky is enrolled into a school so he can realize his full potential if only it weren't for his ratty clothes and constant picking-on by classmates and even teachers. So when Ti brings home a ball hoping to give the kid a new, impressive toy, Dicky's surprised that it's actually an alien from outer space and the 2 become friends and help deal with their family problems.That last part I have to admit was a little hard to write since it doesn't really do that all that much, or well. Think back to the film this got compared to: Steven Spielberg's utterly classic ""E.T"" and think how Elliot was so down and friendless that when the titular character shows up, the 2 become inseparable because the idea of friendship and love wasn't being filled in by anything else. The alien CJ7 is basically a punching bag and he becomes more something to be used than something integral and needed to the 2 men. In fact, one could make a case that they didn't even need the alien since they come to grips with problems on their own. I will admit though the alien is kind of adorable and with the head of ""Chicken Little"" and the body of those things from ""Flubber"" of all things, he almost steals the show.As far as the comedy is concerned, it's going more for slapstick and heart. Like in most comedies with dancing cats, chipmunks, dogs etc, there's got to be the requisite dance and you know the director of ""Kung Fu Hustle"" won't end the film without at least putting in some martial arts business. But tonally it feels wrong personally and I'm not saying this is a bad movie by any means since it did have its moments and it's kind of hard not to at least crack a smile or chuckle but the feel of the movie wants to be something affecting and touching yet it feels more like comedy straight through with only some family scenes to put that part in so it's there.I usually don't run into these kind of films a lot but this is a love it/hate it kind of film where some will love it and get it while others didn't like myself. Guess I wanted more heart in this one; I mean look, the alien literally goes #2 on the kid's hand...who doesn't have the common sense to know when he was literally crapped on.

1170556,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B001B4SYDE,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[1, 1]","There must be some fairy tale or long time story told in China. I have recently viewed two movies that are so very much the same story, told in very different ways. One, The Secret of the Magic Gourd, is told in all the glossiness you would expect from Disney, or a huge film production. And the other is told all gritty and more visceral, this film CJ7.Both films are the story of a young boy who is mistreated at school and misunderstood by the world. He is given this magic thing (in this case it's a little sort of dog like creature from outerspace, in the Magic Gourd - it's a gourd). The magic gives the boy pretty much whatever he wants until he becomes exactly like the children that were abusing him in the first place. The magic wears off and the boy is forced to work for what he wants. Once he's worked hard, he is rewarded with one last major magic thing that makes his life wonderful.Where this film, CJ7, deviates is in the grittiness. Young childern might just want to avoid this, or be warned about some of the events. Sensitive movie watchers might want to avoid the following discussion. I don't know, maybe you want to be surprised by what is pretty obvious in the film. Maybe you'd like to know why this may or may not be appropriate for your child to watch. But you get fair warning. The boy's father actually dies in a construction site accident - he is pulled down about 5 stories with a welding tank. His body flys to the ground with the thud of the tank. The actual impact is hidden by the big boss in the foreground. There is also a ton of scat humor. At one point the boy goes to the bathroom and tells CJ7 to give him the magic beads. We get to witness the dog grunting and grimmacing to deliver a turd on the boys hand. The boy carries that as a good luck charm duing a test. When he discovers it was just a turd, and he yells at the dog, the dog then machine gun fires little turds all over the boy. He is then hosed down by the janitors in full view of the whole school. There's also some pretty harsh language translated in the subtitles.Is this film any good? Well, it's pretty typical Asian story telling - foreign to westerners, tons of excruciating details and then huge gaps in the story line. It's a process that is very hard to follow for westerners. The little boy can be very cute sometimes. The little alien dog is kind of cute. The CG effects are blended pretty nicely with ""real"" puppets and humans. So that all works well. At an hour and a half it is about 20 minutes too long.There is a wonderful moral the dad repeats over and over - we may be poor, but we never lie, we never fight, and we never take things that don't belong to us. It's a great message. And that alone is worthwhile.Be careful with younger children with this film. If they can handle the more pshychological terror or drama, wonderful.

It is a clear descendant of ET, with a touch of The Little Rascals and the Dead End Kids thrown in. Director Steven Chow (who also stars) presents a view of life seen mostly from the perspective of his son, a 10 year old. Chow plays a poor but hardworking father who struggles to keep his son in a fancy school somewhere in China.  The boy faces some tough obstacles, not the least of which is his excessive poverty which causes him to wear clothes that are strictly second rate.  His lowly financial status causes him instant conflict with a group of bullies who torment him unmercifully. Through it all he has little more than his father's exhortations to lead the clean and honest life. But the boy does have the support of one of his teachers, a Miss Yuen (Kitty Chang), who is impossibly sweet and breathtaking much along the lines of Miss Crabtree from the Little Rascals of the 1930s. She is there to be his mother surrogate. Life, however, is more demanding than what his father and Miss Yuen can counter. The class bullies plus a totally insensitive and gross male teacher combine to make him miserable.  Enter the world of a Spielberg-type fantasy. The boy's father finds a remnant of a flying saucer that when he presents it to his son, turns out to be a cute and fluffy life force, capable of matter transformation. When the boy and his new alien friend interact, the movie begins to shift from one tone to another. There are several truly funny scenes of anti-gravity machinations that defy logic.  There are several others that demand that the boy face the harsh reality of bullies who want his new friend for themselves.  There are still others that come perilously close to stark death and tragedy that seem out of place in a light comedy. Yet, I see these tonal fluctuations as an integral part of the plot which requires the boy to grow up in a hurry. He must make decisions about how to use his friend, with ""use"" being the operative word. He must watch his words and promises since words spoken in haste are often a precursor to a crunching reality. And finally, he must recenter himself as to what really counts in his life. The cute and fluffy alien is seen ultimately as no more than a key by which the boy can make some hard choices in a world that promises easy solutions when the only lasting ones are the type that you can fashion yourself out of your inner core. CJ7 is a movie that deftly balances several themes that never manage to go astray.

Zwick,"[1, 1]","Youngsters will get a real kick out of ""CJ7,"" a delightful sci-fi comedy from China that should satisfy any child's requirements for a wish-fulfillment fantasy.Dicky is a grade school boy who lives in an abandoned, dilapidated and roach-infested building with his father, an uneducated laborer who works construction jobs during the day so he can afford to send his boy to a posh private school, and then scavenges the local dumpsites for throw-away items (worn-out shoes, a busted fan) at night.  Due to his low class upbringing and background, as reflected in his unkempt mien and disheveled appearance, Dicky has become a constant target of bullying and ridicule at school - until, that is, he comes into possession of a mysterious ""toy,"" or possibly an alien from outer space, that gives the lad the ability to perform feats of astonishing physical and mental dexterity, to the great amazement and amusement of his fellow students.  Yet, could this little creature (whom Dicky dubs CJ7, after a similar toy made here on earth) wind up causing the boy more trouble than it saves him in the long run?Although the sci-fi aspects can become a bit cutesy and cheesy at times, the real strength of the film lies in its beautifully observed relationship between a down-on-his-luck father who's doing all he can to instill the values of hard work and honesty into his boy, and a son who'd rather spend his time devising ways to get out of doing his schoolwork so he can spend all his time playing with his new-found friend from outer space.  It's that father/son relationship that keeps the story grounded in reality and that gives plausibility and weight to the more fantastical elements of the tale.  Xu Jiao (who is actually a girl in real life) and Stephen Chow (who also co-wrote and directed the film) are utterly charming, winning and appealing as Dicky and his dad, respectively, and they are matched by a whole host of wonderful supporting players, both of the full-sized and the pint-sized variety.Like all good stories aimed at kids, ""CJ7"" is just chock-full of rock-solid values like tolerance, acceptance, discipline and hard work, yet it never feels the need to preach or talk down to its audience.

1170571,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B001B4SYDE,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 3]","It might sound unlikely, but ""CJ7"" is a family picture, directed by Stephen Chow who is probably best known for his two recent comedies ""Shaolin Soccer"" and ""Kung Fu Hustle."" Chinese-made ""CJ7"" is also a comedy, and a very well-made one, but if you expect the same kind of comedy Stephen Chow had done before, you might be disappointed.First, though Stephen Chow plays an important role, his role is a supporting one in ""CJ7."" ""CJ7"" follows the story of a boy named Dicky (Xu Jiao), son of Ti (Stephen Chow), a laborer working at a construction site. The work is hard and Ti is not rich (actually, very poor), but the father spends every money he earns to send Dicky to a prestigious elementary school. But Dicky is not very happy as he is picked on by other rich kids at school.One night Ti finds a strange green thing in the junkyard. He brings it home and gives it to his son as a present without knowing a UFO (yes, a big flying saucer) had left the thing behind. But it is a great present for the boy because Dicky finds a new friend in a new ""toy"" - CJ7 - a tiny puppy-like creature (?) which, it seems, has special powers - or maybe not.It is hard to explain the charms of Stephen Chow's latest film. In ""CJ7"" a familiar theme of love and friendship (like ""E.T."" of course) is developed to make a heart-felt comedy through a convincing portrait of a father-and-son / son-and-creature relationship, but the plot also contains slapsticks, spoofs (from ""MI2"" to Japanese popular manga ""Doraemon""), comic fight scenes created by special effects and one toilet joke.You may take the film as satire targeting modern fast-changing society of China, and believe me or not, ""CJ7"" is also a serious drama (or melodrama) with tearjerking moments. The film will be criticized for its storytelling, which some may call whimsical or even slack, but others may think Chow as director is only making his film subversive, avoiding the pitfalls of comedies and family pictures, especially predictability.[THIS PARAGRAPH HAS MILD SPOILERS] Speaking of subversive, please watch the faces of the supporting actors/actresses closely and you may notice an interesting thing. Xu Jiao, who plays the boy Dicky, is really a girl (she had to have her long hair cut for the role); Han Yong Wua, Dicky's ""love interest"" is actually a male; and two bullying boys of the school, Johnny and his ""bodyguard,"" are played by Huang Lei and 23-year-old Yao Wen Xue, both females.""CJ7"" is less like other over-the-top comedies Stephen Chow did in ""Shaolin Soccer"" and his films made in the 90s (such as ""Forbidden City Cop,"" a must for any Stephen Chow fans). In his latest film Stephen Chow takes the backseat to flesh out the characters Dicky and ""CJ7"" in particular and develop their stories. ""CJ7"" is a nice comedy, funny, and sometimes eccentric and surreal, and it also has a dramatic story driven by the characters you identify with.",4,"Fun Family Picture from the Director of ""Shaolin Soccer""",1219536000,"08 24, 2008",2008,2909,"['might', 'sound', 'unlikely', 'CJ7', 'family', 'picture', 'directed', 'Stephen', 'Chow', 'who', 'probably', 'best', 'known', 'two', 'recent', 'comedies', 'Shaolin', 'Soccer', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'Hustle', 'Chinese-made', 'CJ7', 'also', 'comedy', 'very', 'well-made', 'one', 'expect', 'same', 'kind', 'comedy', 'Stephen', 'Chow', 'had', 'done', 'before', 'might', 'be', 'disappointed.First', 'Stephen', 'Chow', 'important', 'role', 'role', 'supporting', 'one', 'CJ7', 'CJ7', 'story', 'boy', 'named', 'Dicky', 'Xu', 'Jiao', 'son', 'Ti', 'Stephen', 'Chow', 'laborer', 'working', 'construction', 'site', 'work', 'hard', 'Ti', 'not', 'rich', 'actually', 'very', 'poor', 'father', 'money', 'send', 'Dicky', 'prestigious', 'elementary', 'school', 'Dicky', 'not', 'very', 'happy', 'picked', 'other', 'rich', 'kids', 'school.One', 'night', 'Ti', 'strange', 'green', 'thing', 'junkyard', 'home', 'son', 'present', 'knowing', 'UFO', 'yes', 'big', 'flying', 'saucer', 'had', 'left', 'thing', 'behind', 'great', 'present', 'boy', 'Dicky', 'new', 'friend', 'new', 'toy', 'CJ7', 'tiny', 'puppy-like', 'creature', 'special', 'powers', 'maybe', 'not.It', 'hard', 'explain', 'charms', 'Stephen', 'Chow', 'latest', 'film', 'CJ7', 'familiar', 'theme', 'love', 'friendship', 'E.T', 'course', 'developed', 'make', 'heart-felt', 'comedy', 'convincing', 'portrait', 'father-and-son', '/', 'son-and-creature', 'relationship', 'plot', 'also', 'slapsticks', 'spoofs', 'MI2', 'Japanese', 'popular', 'manga', 'Doraemon', 'comic', 'fight', 'scenes', 'created', 'special', 'effects', 'one', 'toilet', 'joke.You', 'may', 'take', 'film', 'satire', 'targeting', 'modern', 'fast-changing', 'society', 'China', 'believe', 'not', 'CJ7', 'also', 'serious', 'drama', 'melodrama', 'tearjerking', 'moments', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'criticized', 'storytelling', 'may', 'call', 'whimsical', 'even', 'slack', 'others', 'may', 'think', 'Chow', 'director', 'only', 'making', 'film', 'subversive', 'avoiding', 'pitfalls', 'comedies', 'family', 'pictures', 'especially', 'predictability', '[', 'THIS', 'PARAGRAPH', 'HAS', 'MILD', 'SPOILERS', ']', 'Speaking', 'subversive', 'please', 'watch', 'supporting', 'closely', 'may', 'notice', 'interesting', 'thing', 'Xu', 'Jiao', 'who', 'boy', 'Dicky', 'really', 'girl', 'had', 'have', 'long', 'hair', 'cut', 'role', 'Han', 'Yong', 'Wua', 'Dicky', 'love', 'interest', 'actually', 'male', 'two', 'bullying', 'boys', 'school', 'Johnny', 'bodyguard', 'are', 'played', 'Huang', 'Lei', '23-year-old', 'Yao', 'Wen', 'Xue', 'females', 'CJ7', 'less', 'other', 'over-the-top', 'comedies', 'Stephen', 'Chow', 'did', 'Shaolin', 'Soccer', 'films', 'made', '90s', 'such', 'Forbidden', 'City', 'Cop', 'must', 'Stephen', 'Chow', 'fans', 'latest', 'film', 'Stephen', 'Chow', 'backseat', 'flesh', 'out', 'characters', 'Dicky', 'CJ7', 'particular', 'develop', 'stories', 'CJ7', 'nice', 'comedy', 'funny', 'sometimes', 'eccentric', 'surreal', 'also', 'dramatic', 'story', 'driven', 'characters', 'identify']",N/A

Dicky (the boy's name in the subtitles, at least) lives with his widowed father. The father struggles to make ends meet, while sending Dicky to the best school that he can afford, determined that Dicky will have all the chances in life that the father never had. Dicky struggles too. Poverty makes him odd kid out at school, and small size makes him an easy target for the school bullies. Almost everything more than essentials in Dicky's life comes from his father's knack for salvage - including an odd little toy ...It would be easy to say too much about this charming movie's plot, especially if you've seen*Batteries Not Included. I leave it to you to watch this self-consciously cute story unfold, all the way to the smiles-all-around ending. The movie's style seems heavy handed, by western standards. Acting and character stereotypes come across as blunt instruments, and the ""flying warriors"" idiom makes an improbable appearance in the schoolyard. A few things might grate on Western sensibilities, too, like what constitutes good parenting - although generally kid safe, a few scenes might not work for very young or very skittish children.
