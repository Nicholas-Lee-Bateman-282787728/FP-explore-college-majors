It does not cover all crimes and this movie is not graphic so is ok for some who get squeamish.  The victim pictured on the cover did not appear in the movie that I could see.Actor that played BTK is great.,4,If you like true crime..,1382313600,"10 21, 2013",2013,334,"['movie', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'Not', 'great', 'tv', 'movie', 'certainly', 'not', 'bad', 'can', 'get', 'cheap', 'enough', 'do', 'recommend', 'not', 'cover', 'crimes', 'movie', 'not', 'graphic', 'so', 'ok', 'who', 'get', 'squeamish', 'victim', 'pictured', 'cover', 'did', 'not', 'appear', 'movie', 'could', 'see.Actor', 'played', 'BTK', 'great']",The Hunt for the BTK Killer
1044224,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B000M9BPF8,California Dreaming,"[0, 2]","I think that the average American -- perhaps even most profilers in the FBI -- thinks that serial killers meet the following criteria:  white male, 30 to 40 years old, balding, never-been-married-and-no-girlfriend-dude-who-lives-with-mommy misogynist, and perhaps average-to-slightly-higher-than-average intelligence.  Lo and behold, you have to admit, Dennis Rader met at least half of these criteria, so you'd perhaps think that the police would have caught him earlier.  But I guess that a lot of local police officers don't give much credence to FBI profilers.  But maybe those police officers have a point.I read an excellent book about Ted Bundy written by Robert Keppel quite a while ago, and from what I remember, Mr. Bundy told Dr. Keppel that, while it's OK to build a basic profile of The Green River Killer, that it wasn't wise to get too attached to that profile.  Mr. Bundy went on to say something like, ""Well, this Riverman of yours,"" as Mr. Bundy called Gary Ridgeway long before anyone knew who Mr. Ridgeway much was, ""I mean, he's the type that fits into his environment.  He's the type that people feel comfortable with.  So don't think that the guy will just look like a monster.""  I'm paraphrasing quite a bit, but that was the gist of it.  And Mr. Bundy was totally right about the killer that Mr. Keppel was searching for:  Mr. Ridgeway was married, he had a job, he probably wasn't ugly but he wasn't a pretty boy either.  And he fit right in as he was a customer of the prostitutes that he killed.  They knew him and mostly trusted him.It's amazing to me how much the BTK murders in Kansas mirrored the Green River Killer murders in Seattle.  Murders started in the 70s (perhaps early 80s, at the latest); it seemed that the killer would never be caught; the advent of DNA testing gave the police a strong suspect 20 to 30 years after the killing began; one cop in particular kept at the case for all the years which caused him professional and personal pain; and some strange twist of fate allowed the police to finally catch the killer in the early-to-mid 2000s.  Sure, Mr. Ridgeway killed prostitutes while Mr. Rader did not.  And Mr. Ridgeway was on the police radar for a very long time while Mr. Rader seemed to appear out of the blue, ""like a ghost,"" as ""his"" detective said during this movie.  But each case had one killer and one cop, over almost the exact same time frame, where each cop-killer pair seemed to be bonded forever.I watched ""The Capture of the Green River Killer"" awhile back, and I just watched ""The BTK Killer"" today.  I'd have to say that the films are quite different.  The former tried to be artistic by using one of the victims from that case, who appears as a kind of a ghost, from a first-person perspective.  (I believe that that victim was actually fictitious for legal reasons.)  Some things worked, some things didn't, but that film had it's moments, although I found it slightly manipulative.  This film is more of a standard police procedural, which I think in some ways is a better and surely safer approach.  I believe that ""Green River"" came more from the victims' perspectives, while BTK came more from the killer's perspective.  Perhaps I liked this film just a little bit more, but it was close.But returning to the subject of profiling, after watching this film, there is one trait that I'm not convinced that Mr. Rader had:  above average intelligence.  After all, what serial killer would be stupid enough to send digital media to the police that would directly indict him?  Well, I know of one.",4,Don't Murder then Mail,1370822400,"06 10, 2013",2013,3568,"['think', 'average', 'American', 'perhaps', 'even', 'most', 'profilers', 'FBI', 'serial', 'killers', 'meet', 'following', 'criteria', 'white', 'male', '30', '40', 'years', 'old', 'balding', 'never-been-married-and-no-girlfriend-dude-who-lives-with-mommy', 'misogynist', 'perhaps', 'average-to-slightly-higher-than-average', 'intelligence', 'Lo', 'behold', 'have', 'admit', 'Dennis', 'Rader', 'met', 'least', 'half', 'criteria', ""'d"", 'perhaps', 'think', 'police', 'would', 'have', 'caught', 'earlier', 'guess', 'lot', 'local', 'police', 'officers', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'much', 'credence', 'FBI', 'profilers', 'maybe', 'police', 'officers', 'have', 'point.I', 'read', 'excellent', 'book', 'Ted', 'Bundy', 'written', 'Robert', 'Keppel', 'quite', 'while', 'ago', 'what', 'remember', 'Mr.', 'Bundy', 'told', 'Dr.', 'Keppel', 'OK', 'build', 'basic', 'profile', 'Green', 'River', 'Killer', 'was', ""n't"", 'wise', 'get', 'too', 'attached', 'profile', 'Mr.', 'Bundy', 'went', 'say', 'something', 'Well', 'Riverman', 'yours', 'Mr.', 'Bundy', 'called', 'Gary', 'Ridgeway', 'long', 'before', 'anyone', 'knew', 'who', 'Mr.', 'Ridgeway', 'much', 'was', 'mean', 'type', 'environment', 'type', 'people', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'guy', 'will', 'just', 'look', 'monster', ""'m"", 'paraphrasing', 'quite', 'bit', 'was', 'gist', 'Mr.', 'Bundy', 'was', 'totally', 'right', 'killer', 'Mr.', 'Keppel', 'was', 'searching', 'Mr.', 'Ridgeway', 'was', 'married', 'had', 'job', 'probably', 'was', ""n't"", 'ugly', 'was', ""n't"", 'pretty', 'boy', 'fit', 'right', 'was', 'customer', 'prostitutes', 'killed', 'knew', 'mostly', 'trusted', 'him.It', 'amazing', 'how', 'much', 'BTK', 'murders', 'Kansas', 'mirrored', 'Green', 'River', 'Killer', 'murders', 'Seattle', 'Murders', 'started', '70s', 'perhaps', 'early', '80s', 'latest', 'seemed', 'killer', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'caught', 'advent', 'DNA', 'testing', 'gave', 'police', 'strong', 'suspect', '20', '30', 'years', 'killing', 'began', 'one', 'cop', 'particular', 'kept', 'case', 'years', 'caused', 'professional', 'personal', 'pain', 'strange', 'twist', 'fate', 'allowed', 'police', 'finally', 'catch', 'killer', 'early-to-mid', '2000s', 'Sure', 'Mr.', 'Ridgeway', 'killed', 'prostitutes', 'Mr.', 'Rader', 'did', 'not', 'Mr.', 'Ridgeway', 'was', 'police', 'radar', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'Mr.', 'Rader', 'seemed', 'appear', 'blue', 'ghost', 'detective', 'said', 'movie', 'case', 'had', 'one', 'killer', 'one', 'cop', 'almost', 'exact', 'same', 'time', 'frame', 'where', 'cop-killer', 'pair', 'seemed', 'be', 'bonded', 'forever.I', 'watched', 'Capture', 'Green', 'River', 'Killer', 'awhile', 'back', 'just', 'watched', 'BTK', 'Killer', 'today', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'films', 'are', 'quite', 'different', 'former', 'tried', 'be', 'artistic', 'using', 'one', 'victims', 'case', 'who', 'kind', 'ghost', 'first-person', 'perspective', 'believe', 'victim', 'was', 'actually', 'fictitious', 'legal', 'reasons', 'things', 'worked', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'film', 'had', 'moments', 'found', 'slightly', 'manipulative', 'film', 'more', 'standard', 'police', 'procedural', 'think', 'ways', 'better', 'surely', 'safer', 'approach', 'believe', 'Green', 'River', 'came', 'more', 'victims', 'perspectives', 'BTK', 'came', 'more', 'killer', 'perspective', 'Perhaps', 'liked', 'film', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'was', 'close.But', 'returning', 'subject', 'profiling', 'watching', 'film', 'one', 'trait', ""'m"", 'not', 'convinced', 'Mr.', 'Rader', 'had', 'above', 'average', 'intelligence', 'what', 'serial', 'killer', 'would', 'be', 'stupid', 'enough', 'send', 'digital', 'media', 'police', 'would', 'directly', 'indict', 'Well', 'know', 'one']",The Hunt for the BTK Killer
