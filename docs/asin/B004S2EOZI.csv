1427008,AAPPWNP9FWVWS,B004S2EOZI,"Kathlyn Storey ""Kathlyn A Storey""","[15, 16]","The Shroud of Turin is a real life mystery: is it authentic or not?  You will have to decide.  This subject has fascinated me for years, and these three dvds are excellent in explaining what is known about this burial cloth advanced to have covered Christ in the tomb.  All three are worth watching; they are capable of inspiring one to read more on the subject.  The information is presented clearly as well as fairly and balanced.  My husband has used these dvds in his men's bible studies. The reason for taking one star off is that the quality of the dvds could be better.  In parts they are somewhat grainy and not as clear as they should be.",4,Very informative,1322006400,"11 23, 2011",2011,647,"['Shroud', 'Turin', 'real', 'life', 'mystery', 'authentic', 'not', 'will', 'have', 'decide', 'subject', 'fascinated', 'years', 'three', 'dvds', 'are', 'excellent', 'explaining', 'what', 'known', 'burial', 'cloth', 'advanced', 'have', 'covered', 'Christ', 'tomb', 'three', 'are', 'worth', 'watching', 'are', 'capable', 'inspiring', 'one', 'read', 'more', 'subject', 'information', 'presented', 'clearly', 'as', 'well', 'fairly', 'balanced', 'husband', 'used', 'dvds', 'men', 'bible', 'studies', 'reason', 'taking', 'one', 'star', 'off', 'quality', 'dvds', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'parts', 'are', 'somewhat', 'grainy', 'not', 'as', 'clear', 'should', 'be']",N/A

It contains three documentaries and special features which include trailers and three additional documentary clips. These films give a good overview of scientific investigations into the &#34;Shroud of Turin,&#34; an unusual cloth that many people believe to be the burial shroud of Jesus Christ preserved down through the centuries.The first film is &#34;The Silent Witness,&#34; a 53-minute British Academy Award winning (1978) documentary narrated by Kenneth More. This film ignited worldwide interest in the Shroud, but is a bit disjointed and dated, being more of historical interest nowadays for its fascinating exploration of a few well-known discoveries. The second two films -- &#34;Shroud of Turin&#34; (2008 BBC documentary, 59 minutes) and &#34;Shroud (2010, 48 minutes) -- are more contemporary and include recent items like the carbon dating that cast some doubt on the Shroud's authenticity. They are also never dull. What I love most about this product is that it has all of this stuff on ONE DVD rather than a multi-disc set, making it a convenient package. I recommend it to anyone interested in this topic.",5,Three Shroud of Turin documentaries on one disc,1399161600,"05 4, 2014",2014,1277,"[""'m"", 'not', '34', 'Shroud', 'fanatic', '34', 'merely', 'curious', 'seeing', 'lecture', 'was', 'quite', 'impressed', 'DVD', 'package', 'Ignatius', 'Press', 'three', 'documentaries', 'special', 'features', 'include', 'trailers', 'three', 'additional', 'documentary', 'clips', 'films', 'give', 'good', 'overview', 'scientific', 'investigations', '34', 'Shroud', 'Turin', '34', 'unusual', 'cloth', 'many', 'people', 'believe', 'be', 'burial', 'shroud', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'preserved', 'down', 'centuries.The', 'first', 'film', '34', 'Silent', 'Witness', '34', '53-minute', 'British', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winning', '1978', 'documentary', 'narrated', 'Kenneth', 'More', 'film', 'ignited', 'worldwide', 'interest', 'Shroud', 'bit', 'disjointed', 'dated', 'being', 'more', 'historical', 'interest', 'nowadays', 'fascinating', 'exploration', 'few', 'well-known', 'discoveries', 'second', 'two', 'films', '34', 'Shroud', 'Turin', '34', '2008', 'BBC', 'documentary', '59', 'minutes', '34', 'Shroud', '2010', '48', 'minutes', 'are', 'more', 'contemporary', 'include', 'recent', 'items', 'carbon', 'dating', 'cast', 'doubt', 'Shroud', 'authenticity', 'are', 'also', 'never', 'dull', 'What', 'love', 'most', 'product', 'stuff', 'ONE', 'DVD', 'rather', 'multi-disc', 'set', 'making', 'convenient', 'package', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'interested', 'topic']",N/A
