We have never been to that part of the world and never plan to go there, especially in winter. While the basic story line is neither new or original, the execution of the story is both warming and held our attention all the way through.My wife especially enjoyed it and warmed to the characters faster than I did. While I had some initial doubts about the Joe Peterson character, my wife, who is also a published children's book writer, felt an immediate bonding with Joe. As the story progressed I found that I too was developing a concern for the characters and their well-being.Yes, the story has a happy ending but that's good too. This is a feel good movie that is fun to watch and gives some insight into life in what is to us, another world.",5,Offbeat and Full of Fun,1393977600,"03 5, 2014",2014,820,"['watched', 'one', 'hunch', 'found', 'be', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'part', 'world', 'never', 'plan', 'go', 'there', 'especially', 'winter', 'basic', 'story', 'line', 'new', 'original', 'execution', 'story', 'warming', 'held', 'attention', 'way', 'through.My', 'wife', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'warmed', 'characters', 'faster', 'did', 'had', 'initial', 'doubts', 'Joe', 'Peterson', 'character', 'wife', 'who', 'also', 'published', 'children', 'book', 'writer', 'felt', 'immediate', 'bonding', 'Joe', 'story', 'progressed', 'found', 'too', 'was', 'developing', 'concern', 'characters', 'well-being.Yes', 'story', 'happy', 'ending', 'good', 'too', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'fun', 'watch', 'insight', 'life', 'what', 'world']",N/A

My husband and I had to keep fast forwarding to see if something would happen other than at a snail's pace. So the guy met a girl. Big deal! there was no chemistry, no fun, no action, no laughs, no good acting, not even great scenery. Just a terrible waste of time. Tony Shaloub was great as Mr. Monk, but he is terrible here.

Most of the actors except Tony Shalhoub(Monk) were unknown to me.  There are a lot of laughs, some romance, some dark moments, and a lot of lessons to be learned.  My favorite character was Axel, played by Barry Corbin who introduces the writer to ice fishing, and basically tries to find a common bond with everyone.
