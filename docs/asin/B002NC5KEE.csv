1279814,A3MQ15651KGVLJ,B002NC5KEE,Rick L. Parrish,"[8, 8]","People may watch and say...'what hair!'...'what clothes!'...but they won't mistake the intensity of Ben Gazzara's father or the slow seeping away of childhood innocence in Robby Benson's Richie...not to mention Eileen Brennan's muted anguish as she watches both her son and husband spiral out of control...after the free love and drugs of the sixties when the atmosphere had penetrated middle America the price to be paid became more and more evident in the seventies.  This film captures that horror that parents felt when they saw their children completely out of control and in some cases violently so and didn't know what to do about it or how to stop it.  And for all those who say...'oh, it was just over reaction on the parent's part driving him to it!' remember the outcome...and then remember this was a true story...I don't think the effect or the problem has gone away and indications are it's on the rise again in High Schools.  Well, here's a cautionary tale we'd all be wise to heed.  For all those who say it's dated and could be better done today...remember this...the human condition doesn't change...only the trappings that surround it...it could be currently done...but it couldn't be better done.",5,Still Powerfull,1280620800,"08 1, 2010",2010,1216,"['People', 'may', 'watch', 'say', 'hair', ""'what"", 'wo', ""n't"", 'mistake', 'intensity', 'Ben', 'Gazzara', 'father', 'slow', 'seeping', 'away', 'childhood', 'innocence', 'Robby', 'Benson', 'Richie', 'not', 'mention', 'Eileen', 'Brennan', 'muted', 'anguish', 'son', 'husband', 'spiral', 'control', 'free', 'love', 'drugs', 'sixties', 'when', 'atmosphere', 'had', 'penetrated', 'middle', 'America', 'price', 'be', 'paid', 'became', 'more', 'more', 'evident', 'seventies', 'film', 'horror', 'parents', 'felt', 'when', 'saw', 'children', 'completely', 'control', 'cases', 'violently', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'how', 'stop', 'who', 'say', 'was', 'just', 'reaction', 'parent', 'part', 'driving', 'remember', 'outcome', 'then', 'remember', 'was', 'true', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'effect', 'problem', 'gone', 'away', 'indications', 'are', 'rise', 'again', 'High', 'Schools', 'Well', 'here', 'cautionary', 'tale', ""'d"", 'be', 'wise', 'heed', 'who', 'say', 'dated', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'done', 'today', 'remember', 'human', 'condition', ""n't"", 'change', 'only', 'trappings', 'surround', 'could', 'be', 'currently', 'done', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'better', 'done']",N/A

1279817,AY9MU8X6J8GTJ,B002NC5KEE,"Will o' the Wisp ""Alan""","[2, 4]","This 1977 movie is very dated by today's production standards.  Robbie Benson was really beginning to make a name for himself back then but I didn't find him all that convincing in this movie, particularly having read the book it is based upon before I saw the movie.  In the book Richie becomes more and more belligerent and disrepectful and given the content restrictions on language and such back then, Richie's behavior loses some of its impact.  The movie would've been far more believable and impactful if it had the license of really showing Richie as the book depicts him.Ben Gazzara, as Richie's father George, does very well in this movie and is believable as a man who cannot express and connect with his own emotions, much less understand his son who is out of control.  Eileen Brennan as Carol, Richie's mother, isn't as good.  The movie just doesn't get at how ineffective she was in trying to mediate between her husband and their son.The climactic scene where Richie threatens his parents with a weapon and George tries to back him off with his revolver is very gripping.  Does George kill Richie because he's genuinely scared of him or is he abetting his son's suicide?  In the end a grand jury refused to indict George.I think this movie, were it made today, would be much better although I think it really shocked people back in the day.",3,worthwhile,1254355200,"10 1, 2009",2009,1356,"['1977', 'movie', 'very', 'dated', 'today', 'production', 'standards', 'Robbie', 'Benson', 'was', 'really', 'beginning', 'make', 'name', 'back', 'then', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'convincing', 'movie', 'particularly', 'having', 'read', 'book', 'based', 'saw', 'movie', 'book', 'Richie', 'more', 'more', 'belligerent', 'disrepectful', 'given', 'content', 'restrictions', 'language', 'such', 'back', 'then', 'Richie', 'behavior', 'impact', 'movie', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'far', 'more', 'believable', 'impactful', 'had', 'license', 'really', 'showing', 'Richie', 'book', 'him.Ben', 'Gazzara', 'Richie', 'father', 'George', 'very', 'well', 'movie', 'believable', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'express', 'connect', 'own', 'emotions', 'much', 'less', 'understand', 'son', 'who', 'control', 'Eileen', 'Brennan', 'Carol', 'Richie', 'mother', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'get', 'how', 'ineffective', 'was', 'trying', 'mediate', 'husband', 'son.The', 'climactic', 'scene', 'where', 'Richie', 'parents', 'weapon', 'George', 'tries', 'back', 'off', 'revolver', 'very', 'gripping', 'Does', 'George', 'kill', 'Richie', 'genuinely', 'scared', 'abetting', 'son', 'suicide', 'end', 'grand', 'jury', 'refused', 'indict', 'George.I', 'think', 'movie', 'were', 'made', 'today', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'think', 'really', 'shocked', 'people', 'back', 'day']",N/A
