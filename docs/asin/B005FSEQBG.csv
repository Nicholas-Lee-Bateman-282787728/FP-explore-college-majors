There were no laugh tracks or even whitty quips by way of writer/producer and professional comedian/satirist Harry Shearer. This film portrayed the death and devastation that hit NO, but more importantly it explained why the real villian was not mother nature, but ineptitude. The ineptitude came by way of the Army Corp of Engineers which built the levees that surround the city to only withstand a level 3 hurricane. Anything higher had the potential to devastate the city and inevitably did when parts of the city flooded. Adding insult to injury, FEMA was slow in coming to the aid of the residents and this only added to the chaos and devastation that the residents of the city (most prominently the poor, sick, or elderly)had to endure.This film explains why the residents of NO blame the government and its agencies for not acting faster or offering them adequate protection against a catastrophe of monumental proportion.

1459338,A35YBNS37JJ5AV,B005FSEQBG,Daniel J. Fiebiger,"[2, 2]","Don't look for any comedy from Harry Shearer or even John Goodman who does a few brief bits in sections of this film.  This is a serious, well-researched documentary about the REAL reasons why new Orleans flooded so easily and quickly when Hurricane Katrina hit them in the summer of 2005, cuz the problem that caused the flood STILL EXISTS!Spoiler Alert:  I'm gonna tell you the main reason right now, cuz even people who don't see this worthy DVD need to know this.  Half of New Orleans is ABOVE sea level, so that wasn't the reason.  It's cuz the Army Corps of Engineers (*) did a shoddy job of building the flood control walls, putting them on lose sandy soil that the flood waters EASILY could erode UNDER the walls, which then allowed the walls to simply fall over and let all the water in.  (* The Army Corps usually do good work; the awesome Bonneville Dam on the Columbia River in my part of America was VERY well built by them.)  But the job was rushed in New Orleans and then swept under then table when several independent engineers tried to warn them that a flood would still happen, even when everybody was told by the Corps that the walls would hold back the water just fine.The film is professionally produced with lots of animation and understandable illustrations of what is being talked about and Shearer paid attention to pacing to keep interest in the film crisp and to the point.  It goes into great detail (as good as any PBS documentary) about the area's history, and why the flood happened, how it could have been prevented, how public perception of the whole event was manipulated to NOT know the REAL truth of the disaster, and how it STILL needs to be corrected, cuz it's only a matter of time until another big hurricane hits New Orleans and the whole flood thing happens all over again, and again, until the walls are re-built on more solid ground and foundations.The only downside of the film is that Shearer badly needs a shave for most of the film, but I suppose that could be fixed by ILM for the Blu-Ray edition.The film is highly recommend for anyone who lives anywhere near there, and by anyone who gives a damn about one of America's cultural high-spot treasures who should never have to go thru this nightmare again.Are you watching.

1459339,A1KONL8ECYFG37,B005FSEQBG,DVD Verdict,"[7, 14]","Judge Clark Douglas, DVD Verdict-- Over the course of the past few years, it's been made clear that the devastation brought to New Orleans was not entirely a result of the natural disaster that was Hurricane Katrina. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers made a series of critical failures that turned what could have been merely a bad situation into a massive tragedy. In the wake of the Hurricane, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers devoted its resources to protecting itself and attacking those who called its integrity into question. It's a bitter, unpleasant story that needs to be told, but is Harry Shearer really the right guy to tell it?My initial instinct would have been ""yes."" Shearer is an intelligent, thoughtful person (as evidenced by his newspaper editorials, his Huffington Post blog entries, and his numerous appearances on television talk shows addressing the subjects he explores in this film) and certainly has some personal knowledge of the area (he has been a part-time New Orleans resident for more than twenty years). Additionally, his sharp comic sensibilities suggested that he might be able to bring some flavorful bite to his take on this part of history.Disappointingly, Shearer's actual movie proves much less involving than many of the public appearances he's made to promote the film. I expected the documentary to be smart and well-informed, which it most assuredly is. However, I didn't expect the execution to be so dry, amateurish, and uninvolving. Shearer assembles a sizable crew of individuals to give us the specific details on what happened piece-by-piece, but the manner in which the film is structured makes it feel more like a 90-page legal report than a gripping real-life drama.To be sure, The Big Uneasy is a well-intentioned film, and it's valuable if you're just looking for the basic facts on what happened. Still, it lacks both the emotional pull of Spike Lee's When the Levees Broke and the polish of an in-depth New York Times article. It will prove a solid resource for high school students in years to come, but the average viewer has numerous superior options that cover similar territory to choose from.-Full review at dvdverdict.com",3,Shearer seems to struggle with finding a way to make his endless stream of information involving,1313539200,"08 17, 2011",2011,2185,"['Judge', 'Clark', 'Douglas', 'DVD', 'Verdict', 'course', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'been', 'made', 'clear', 'devastation', 'brought', 'New', 'Orleans', 'was', 'not', 'entirely', 'result', 'natural', 'disaster', 'was', 'Hurricane', 'Katrina', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'Corps', 'Engineers', 'made', 'series', 'critical', 'failures', 'turned', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'merely', 'bad', 'situation', 'massive', 'tragedy', 'wake', 'Hurricane', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'Corps', 'Engineers', 'devoted', 'resources', 'protecting', 'attacking', 'who', 'called', 'integrity', 'question', 'bitter', 'unpleasant', 'story', 'be', 'told', 'Harry', 'Shearer', 'really', 'right', 'guy', 'tell', 'My', 'initial', 'instinct', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'yes', 'Shearer', 'intelligent', 'thoughtful', 'person', 'evidenced', 'newspaper', 'editorials', 'Huffington', 'Post', 'blog', 'entries', 'numerous', 'appearances', 'television', 'talk', 'addressing', 'subjects', 'film', 'certainly', 'personal', 'knowledge', 'area', 'been', 'part-time', 'New', 'Orleans', 'resident', 'more', 'twenty', 'years', 'Additionally', 'sharp', 'comic', 'sensibilities', 'suggested', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'bring', 'flavorful', 'bite', 'take', 'part', 'history.Disappointingly', 'Shearer', 'actual', 'movie', 'much', 'less', 'involving', 'many', 'public', 'made', 'promote', 'film', 'expected', 'documentary', 'be', 'smart', 'well-informed', 'most', 'assuredly', 'However', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'execution', 'be', 'so', 'dry', 'amateurish', 'uninvolving', 'Shearer', 'sizable', 'crew', 'individuals', 'give', 'specific', 'details', 'what', 'happened', 'piece-by-piece', 'manner', 'film', 'structured', 'feel', 'more', '90-page', 'legal', 'report', 'gripping', 'real-life', 'drama.To', 'be', 'sure', 'Big', 'Uneasy', 'well-intentioned', 'film', 'valuable', ""'re"", 'just', 'looking', 'basic', 'facts', 'what', 'happened', 'Still', 'emotional', 'pull', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'When', 'Levees', 'Broke', 'polish', 'in-depth', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'article', 'will', 'prove', 'solid', 'resource', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'years', 'come', 'average', 'viewer', 'numerous', 'superior', 'options', 'cover', 'similar', 'territory', 'choose', 'from.-Full', 'review', 'dvdverdict.com']",The Big Uneasy

Bush's indifferent response to the 2005 Hurricane Katrina disaster.  This film, Harry Shearer's THE BIG UNEASY, is the GODFATHER, PART TWO to the GODFATHER that is WHEN THE LEVEES BROKE, showing what came before and what's happened since.For all the faults of the Bush gang, they weren't the only ones to put politics and other special interests above the safety of the people of New Orleans, THE BIG UNEASY tells us. People know Harry Shearer best for both his roles in Christopher Guest's comedies and as the voice of many characters on television's THE SIMPSONS.  But he keeps a straight face in THE BIG UNEASY and that may be to hold back tears, not smiles.Is it my imagination, or in recent years have documentaries such as THE BIG UNEASY taken the lead in providing the public with the kind of facts news organizations used to report?  Not that Harry Shearer had to do much digging.  THE BIG UNEASY notes it is merely conveying information that is public, not from a government file marked ""Top Secret.""  Perhaps another film, what would be the GODFATHER, PART THREE to Spike's and Harry's documentaries, will backtrack to the corporate news media that receded from the Katrina story with the flood waters.See THE BIG UNEASY.",5,"Down on the bayou, why, you never know just what you're doin'",1340928000,"06 29, 2012",2012,1294,"['Spike', 'Lee', 'documentary', 'WHEN', 'THE', 'LEVEES', 'BROKE', 'covers', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'indifferent', 'response', '2005', 'Hurricane', 'Katrina', 'disaster', 'film', 'Harry', 'Shearer', 'THE', 'BIG', 'UNEASY', 'GODFATHER', 'PART', 'TWO', 'GODFATHER', 'WHEN', 'THE', 'LEVEES', 'BROKE', 'showing', 'what', 'came', 'before', 'what', 'happened', 'since.For', 'faults', 'Bush', 'gang', 'were', ""n't"", 'only', 'ones', 'put', 'politics', 'other', 'special', 'interests', 'safety', 'people', 'New', 'Orleans', 'THE', 'BIG', 'UNEASY', 'People', 'know', 'Harry', 'Shearer', 'best', 'roles', 'Christopher', 'Guest', 'comedies', 'voice', 'many', 'characters', 'television', 'THE', 'SIMPSONS', 'straight', 'face', 'THE', 'BIG', 'UNEASY', 'may', 'be', 'hold', 'back', 'tears', 'not', 'smiles.Is', 'imagination', 'recent', 'years', 'have', 'documentaries', 'such', 'THE', 'BIG', 'UNEASY', 'taken', 'lead', 'providing', 'public', 'kind', 'facts', 'news', 'organizations', 'used', 'report', 'Not', 'Harry', 'Shearer', 'had', 'do', 'much', 'digging', 'BIG', 'UNEASY', 'notes', 'merely', 'conveying', 'information', 'public', 'not', 'government', 'file', 'marked', 'Top', 'Secret', 'Perhaps', 'film', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'GODFATHER', 'PART', 'THREE', 'Spike', 'Harry', 'documentaries', 'will', 'backtrack', 'corporate', 'news', 'media', 'receded', 'Katrina', 'story', 'flood', 'waters.See', 'THE', 'BIG', 'UNEASY']",The Big Uneasy
