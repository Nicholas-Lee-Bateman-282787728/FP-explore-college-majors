1099834,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B000V9LK4A,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[13, 15]","The first season of the Britcom geekfest ""The IT Crowd"" was absolutely brilliant, technonerdy, and gutsplittingly funny. Guess what: the second season is actually better than the first -- it introduces a new insane boss to make life difficult for the IT department, and has them grappling with the difficulties of dinner parties, funerals, gay musicals (""It's a gay musical called 'Gay'... that's very gay"") and assorted other problems.Jen is annoyed when a possible date with the attractive Philip is turned into a ""work outing"" to a musical, and further annoyed when Roy pronounces Philip to be gay. Except the musical turns out to be a gay extravaganza, and Philip is well-acquainted with every gay person associated with it. In the meantime, Roy and Moss's efforts to find a bathroom without an attendant lead to a disastrous pair of mistaken identities.Then when Denholm (or Reynholm, I'm not quite sure) walks out a high window, the IT department is threatened with doom at his disastrous funeral, and Roy becomes convinced that he's about to die. Then Roy becomes obsessed with watching a Korean zombie movie (with a twist!), while Moss's efforts to see new people (""We're stagnating, Roy! You're my wife!"") have him signing up for a cookery course... except it's not really a course, but a personal ad run by a German cannibal.Then when Jen has a dinner party for her friends and her new boyfriend's friends, she ends up having to invite Roy, Moss and Richmond... and her friends turn out to be a twittering nervous flake, a mummified model, and a drunken randy divorcee. Hijinks ensue. And when Jen complains about her bad bras, Moss creates the ultimate  bra (which he calls the ""Abracadabra"") and plans to patent it... but as Jen finds out during a vital meeting, there are downsides to this bra! Finally, the new boss Dougkas makes Jen his new P.A., despite her reluctance to leave her nerdy friends -- but of course it's all a big clumsy attempt at seduction. With naked pictures and suggestive commercials.Living bras, dead flies, really mean anti-piracy ads, German cannibals (""He WANTED to EAT YOU!""), the ultimate cell phone vibrate setting, handicapped bathrooms, gay musicals and a guy with the unfortunate name of ""Peter File"" (say it fast and out loud). ""The IT Crowd: The Complete Second Season"" piles the increasingly bizarre sitcom problems on our already overburdened, underappreciated IT personnel, and it actually is funnier than the season that came before it.Part of this is from the brilliant writing, which is riddled with surreal situations (Moss's bra bursts into flames... on Jen's body) and weird dialogue (""If two grown men can't make a pervert happy for a few minutes in order to watch a film about zombies, then maybe we should pack up and move to Iran!""). And while the IT department's social awkwardness is still the main theme, their problems have become even stranger with time (Jen finds that the smoker's area looks a lot like a downtrodden Communist country, complete with Eastern European accents).The three main actors are still utterly brilliant --  Katherine Parkinson's Jen struggles to avoid Douglas' ridiculously blatant come-ons, and falls prey to an old addiction; Richard Ayoade's twitchy Moss remains socially inept and jerky, but turns out to have some brilliant scientific skills; and Chris O'Dowd's Roy remains a bored slob who ends in over his head more than once. And Noel Fielding has some fun with mellow goth Richmond, who finds an unlikely girlfriend, contemplates evil omens (""I trod on a piece of Lego""), and turns out to have Spiderman-like powers.And Matt Berry joins the cast as the very dramatic Douglas Denholm (""SPEAK, PRIEST!""), whose main goal seems to be to have sex with Jen. He's as crazy and out-of-touch as his dad, but way more lecherous.More potent in its surreal comedy and awkward hilarity, ""The IT Crowd: The Complete Second Season"" is an absolute must-see for comedy fans.",5,What funeral?,1252454400,"09 9, 2009",2009,3958,"['first', 'season', 'Britcom', 'geekfest', 'IT', 'Crowd', 'was', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'technonerdy', 'gutsplittingly', 'funny', 'Guess', 'what', 'second', 'season', 'actually', 'better', 'first', 'new', 'insane', 'boss', 'make', 'life', 'difficult', 'IT', 'department', 'grappling', 'difficulties', 'dinner', 'parties', 'funerals', 'gay', 'musicals', 'gay', 'musical', 'called', 'very', 'gay', 'assorted', 'other', 'problems.Jen', 'annoyed', 'when', 'possible', 'date', 'attractive', 'Philip', 'turned', 'work', 'outing', 'musical', 'further', 'annoyed', 'when', 'Roy', 'Philip', 'be', 'gay', 'musical', 'out', 'be', 'gay', 'extravaganza', 'Philip', 'well-acquainted', 'gay', 'person', 'associated', 'meantime', 'Roy', 'Moss', 'efforts', 'find', 'bathroom', 'attendant', 'lead', 'disastrous', 'pair', 'mistaken', 'identities.Then', 'when', 'Denholm', 'Reynholm', ""'m"", 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'out', 'high', 'window', 'IT', 'department', 'threatened', 'doom', 'disastrous', 'funeral', 'Roy', 'becomes', 'convinced', 'die', 'Then', 'Roy', 'becomes', 'obsessed', 'watching', 'Korean', 'zombie', 'movie', 'twist', 'Moss', 'efforts', 'see', 'new', 'people', ""'re"", 'stagnating', 'Roy', ""'re"", 'wife', 'have', 'signing', 'up', 'cookery', 'course', 'not', 'really', 'course', 'personal', 'ad', 'run', 'German', 'cannibal.Then', 'when', 'Jen', 'dinner', 'party', 'friends', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'friends', 'up', 'having', 'invite', 'Roy', 'Moss', 'Richmond', 'friends', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'twittering', 'nervous', 'flake', 'mummified', 'model', 'drunken', 'randy', 'divorcee', 'Hijinks', 'ensue', 'when', 'Jen', 'bad', 'bras', 'Moss', 'ultimate', 'bra', 'Abracadabra', 'patent', 'Jen', 'out', 'vital', 'meeting', 'are', 'downsides', 'bra', 'Finally', 'new', 'boss', 'Dougkas', 'Jen', 'new', 'P.A.', 'reluctance', 'leave', 'nerdy', 'friends', 'course', 'big', 'clumsy', 'attempt', 'seduction', 'naked', 'pictures', 'suggestive', 'commercials.Living', 'bras', 'dead', 'flies', 'really', 'mean', 'anti-piracy', 'ads', 'German', 'cannibals', 'WANTED', 'EAT', 'YOU', 'ultimate', 'cell', 'phone', 'vibrate', 'setting', 'handicapped', 'bathrooms', 'gay', 'musicals', 'guy', 'unfortunate', 'name', 'Peter', 'File', 'say', 'fast', 'loud', 'IT', 'Crowd', 'Complete', 'Second', 'Season', 'increasingly', 'bizarre', 'sitcom', 'problems', 'already', 'overburdened', 'underappreciated', 'IT', 'personnel', 'actually', 'funnier', 'season', 'came', 'it.Part', 'brilliant', 'writing', 'riddled', 'surreal', 'situations', 'Moss', 'bra', 'flames', 'Jen', 'body', 'weird', 'dialogue', 'two', 'grown', 'men', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'pervert', 'happy', 'few', 'minutes', 'order', 'watch', 'film', 'zombies', 'then', 'maybe', 'should', 'pack', 'up', 'move', 'Iran', 'IT', 'department', 'social', 'awkwardness', 'still', 'main', 'theme', 'problems', 'have', 'become', 'even', 'stranger', 'time', 'Jen', 'smoker', 'area', 'lot', 'downtrodden', 'Communist', 'country', 'complete', 'Eastern', 'European', 'accents', '.The', 'three', 'main', 'actors', 'are', 'still', 'utterly', 'brilliant', 'Katherine', 'Parkinson', 'Jen', 'avoid', 'Douglas', 'ridiculously', 'blatant', 'come-ons', 'prey', 'old', 'addiction', 'Richard', 'Ayoade', 'twitchy', 'Moss', 'socially', 'inept', 'jerky', 'out', 'have', 'brilliant', 'scientific', 'skills', 'Chris', ""O'Dowd"", 'Roy', 'bored', 'slob', 'who', 'head', 'more', 'once', 'Noel', 'Fielding', 'fun', 'mellow', 'Richmond', 'who', 'unlikely', 'girlfriend', 'evil', 'omens', 'trod', 'piece', 'Lego', 'out', 'have', 'Spiderman-like', 'powers.And', 'Matt', 'Berry', 'cast', 'very', 'dramatic', 'Douglas', 'Denholm', 'SPEAK', 'PRIEST', 'main', 'goal', 'be', 'have', 'sex', 'Jen', 'crazy', 'out-of-touch', 'dad', 'way', 'more', 'lecherous.More', 'potent', 'surreal', 'comedy', 'awkward', 'hilarity', 'IT', 'Crowd', 'Complete', 'Second', 'Season', 'absolute', 'must-see', 'comedy', 'fans']",The IT Crowd - Series 2

Episode two sees the suicide of corporate malfeasant Denholm Reynholm and the introduction of his son Douglas (played by Matt Berry) as the new head of the company whose lecherous ways introduce an ongoing theme of workplace harassment.  (The switch is a good one, shaking up the dynamic of a show before Denholm's manic corporate energy started to wear out its welcome on viewers.)

Finally, the company is owned by a person who knows nothing about running a business, yet manages to keep things afloat.If you like British comedy, like to laugh and understand the humor of computer nerds, this series is for you!",5,Too short!,1309392000,"06 30, 2011",2011,1163,"['do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'funny', 'Apparently', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'sense', 'humor', 'are', 'IT', 'very', 'different', 'American', 'humor', ""n't"", 'constant', 'soundtrack', 'playing', 'top', 'everything', 'humor', ""n't"", 'always', 'drinking', 'sex', 'related', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'story', 'lines', 'follow', 'episode', 'episode', 'making', ""'re"", 'glued', 'tellie', 'week.The', 'characters', 'are', 'exactly', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'find', 'IT', 'department', 'odd', 'One', 'complete', 'nerd', 'who', 'too', 'cool', 'everyone', 'other', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'labeled', 'autistic', 'play', 'other', 'fantastically', 'are', 'managed', 'woman', 'who', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'computers', 'pretended', 'could', 'get', 'job', 'are', 'visited', 'time', 'time', 'company', 'recluse', 'housed', 'back', 'room', 'department', 'job', 'never', 'really', 'explained', 'just', 'there', 'Finally', 'company', 'owned', 'person', 'who', 'nothing', 'running', 'business', 'yet', 'keep', 'things', 'British', 'comedy', 'laugh', 'understand', 'humor', 'computer', 'nerds', 'series']",The IT Crowd - Series 2

1099851,A3MUSWDCTZINQZ,B000V9LK4A,"Ulalume Jones ""Creative Gal""","[4, 4]","I started watching this on a friend's recommendation on IFC and I am glad I did.  It involves people from two shows I love, Black Books and Look Around You and I can say if you like that type of humor, you will like the IT Crowd.  If you work in IT, you will love it more. I mean, critics say oh the ""have you turned it on and off"" line isn't funny...but have any of those people worked in IT?  Probably not.  Most computer problems can be solved by turning the computer on and off or plugging it in.  And this is why it is to frustrating for IT people to talk to the normals upstairs and they seem to always be in a dark room or basement.The actors are so funny. Moss, Roy, Jen, the ignorant bosses and the goth guy Richmond, who is locked away in the IT's dungeon. I find it witty and original.  Whoever said the laughter is canned, it isn't. They show it being filmed in front of an audience, it's real sound.  They truly jump into their character roles without being too cliche.  The jokes come at you a mile a minute too.  Even the minor characters are great.  There is also a lot of Mighty Boosh crossovers here, namely Noel Fielding and Richard Ayoade...so fans of that would find this show worthwhile too.  It's got about the same vibe, though the IT Crowd is a lot less surreal.  Where Mighty Boosh can be hit or miss, the IT Crowd is always on target. Haven't seen even a just ok episode yet, which is amazing to me.  It reminds me a lot of the wonderful Black Books, where every show was worthwhile and hilarious. It has ideas that other comedy shows don't try...like cannibalism or making light of car crash victims or doing a Russian movie parody of smokers.  To me, if you have a sense of humor that is not witty or cynical, you might as watch The Big Bang Theory, which isn't that funny at all. I think they actually copied from the IT Crowd and put a hot girl into the  mix instead of a Jen type, but I am so smitten by pale English girls that look normal, that appeals a lot more to me than what a ""hot""girl is.  To me, the hot, overly tan, dumb lead girl is so clique.  Jen has smarts, even if she doesn't know what IT means.  She shows it in other ways and isn't a cliche. None of the characters, even Richmond, is a total cliche.  That is why it is refreshing to watch.  So watch it!But what I like most in the work put into the DVD. All the graphic scenes are well done and run for a really long time. You can get a chuckle out of the graphics as well as the episodes.  The menus are awesome, the Russian graphic/cigarette Tetris is great, the Street Fighter parodies are awesome, wait for it at least four times, you won't be disappointed. Whomever did the graphic work on this really took the show into consideration.  The commentary is good as well, found out a lot about the show and motivations of its writer/director.",5,You need to check out the extras and graphics of the DVD...esp the Street Fighter/Mortal Kombat Parody,1254787200,"10 6, 2009",2009,2844,"['started', 'watching', 'friend', 'recommendation', 'IFC', 'am', 'glad', 'did', 'people', 'two', 'shows', 'love', 'Black', 'Books', 'Look', 'can', 'say', 'like', 'type', 'humor', 'will', 'like', 'IT', 'Crowd', 'work', 'IT', 'will', 'love', 'more', 'mean', 'critics', 'say', 'have', 'turned', 'line', ""n't"", 'funny', 'have', 'people', 'worked', 'IT', 'Probably', 'not', 'Most', 'computer', 'problems', 'can', 'be', 'solved', 'turning', 'computer', 'plugging', 'why', 'frustrating', 'IT', 'people', 'talk', 'normals', 'upstairs', 'seem', 'always', 'be', 'dark', 'room', 'basement.The', 'actors', 'are', 'so', 'funny', 'Moss', 'Roy', 'Jen', 'ignorant', 'bosses', 'goth', 'guy', 'Richmond', 'who', 'locked', 'away', 'IT', 'dungeon', 'find', 'witty', 'original', 'said', 'laughter', 'canned', ""n't"", 'show', 'being', 'filmed', 'front', 'audience', 'real', 'sound', 'truly', 'jump', 'character', 'roles', 'being', 'too', 'cliche', 'jokes', 'come', 'mile', 'minute', 'too', 'Even', 'minor', 'characters', 'are', 'great', 'also', 'lot', 'Mighty', 'Boosh', 'crossovers', 'here', 'namely', 'Noel', 'Fielding', 'Richard', 'Ayoade', 'so', 'fans', 'would', 'find', 'show', 'too', 'got', 'same', 'vibe', 'IT', 'Crowd', 'lot', 'less', 'surreal', 'Where', 'Mighty', 'Boosh', 'can', 'be', 'hit', 'miss', 'IT', 'Crowd', 'always', 'target', 'Have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'even', 'just', 'ok', 'episode', 'yet', 'amazing', 'lot', 'wonderful', 'Black', 'Books', 'where', 'show', 'was', 'worthwhile', 'hilarious', 'ideas', 'other', 'comedy', 'shows', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'cannibalism', 'making', 'light', 'car', 'crash', 'victims', 'doing', 'Russian', 'movie', 'parody', 'smokers', 'have', 'sense', 'humor', 'not', 'witty', 'cynical', 'might', 'watch', 'Big', 'Bang', 'Theory', ""n't"", 'funny', 'think', 'actually', 'copied', 'IT', 'Crowd', 'put', 'hot', 'girl', 'mix', 'instead', 'Jen', 'type', 'am', 'so', 'smitten', 'pale', 'English', 'girls', 'look', 'normal', 'appeals', 'lot', 'more', 'what', 'hot', 'girl', 'hot', 'overly', 'tan', 'dumb', 'lead', 'girl', 'so', 'clique', 'Jen', 'smarts', 'even', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'IT', 'other', 'ways', ""n't"", 'cliche', 'None', 'characters', 'even', 'Richmond', 'total', 'cliche', 'why', 'refreshing', 'watch', 'So', 'watch', 'what', 'like', 'most', 'work', 'put', 'DVD', 'graphic', 'scenes', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'run', 'really', 'long', 'time', 'can', 'get', 'chuckle', 'graphics', 'as', 'well', 'episodes', 'menus', 'are', 'awesome', 'Russian', 'graphic/cigarette', 'Tetris', 'great', 'Street', 'Fighter', 'parodies', 'are', 'awesome', 'wait', 'least', 'four', 'times', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'did', 'graphic', 'work', 'really', 'took', 'show', 'consideration', 'commentary', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'found', 'out', 'lot', 'show', 'motivations', 'writer/director']",The IT Crowd - Series 2
