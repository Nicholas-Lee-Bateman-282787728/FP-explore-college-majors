1383736,AGEIT17HENDIS,B0042U9B3G,Alfred Johnson,"[9, 13]","Needless to say this little cinematic effort to put the sense of Allen Ginsberg's seminal modernist poem, Howl, on the screen is more than welcome. As I have repeatedly emphasized on previous occasions any poem that starts of like this one is going to get my attention and keep it every time. I would have given a lot, if only I had been old enough, to be in that gallery seated next to Jack Keroauc in that beat, heat San Francisco night to hear this start:""I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked, dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn, looking for an angry fix, angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night . . .''I have also of late made note of the influence of the ""beats"" in my own youthful political and social development in reviewing books and films about Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, Neal Cassady and the gang. A prima facie case can be made by me, and has recently in this space, that Ginsberg's Howl is his search for the blue-pink great American West night that animated my youth, and the youth of my generation of the 1960s.  Who would have thought that a poem (and the legal tangle involved in its publication and distribution), with help from an excellent cast starting with James Franco, could carry a whole film.

The film interleaves scenes of the 1957 obscenity trial (The defendant was the publisher of the book, not Ginsberg himself), with snippets of the openly-gay Ginsberg's life and loves, some public readings of his works, as well as an ongoing interview he is taping. The film also includes incredible animation that brings the poem to life on the screen.Already acclaimed at Sundance and the Berlin festivals, this is certain to get some attention at Oscar time, likely for Franco's performance and the previously mentioned animation. True disclosure time:  I am not a fan of Ginsberg's work, or poetry at all, and was expecting this to be a snoozer.  The animation made it much more enjoyable for me and likely will do the same for other viewers.

1383739,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B0042U9B3G,C. B Collins Jr.,"[0, 0]","This is a film about a poem, a very famous poem. It is an ambitious film since it must relate the poem, give the context of the poem, portray the biography of the poet, and use the obscenity trail around this poem to highlight its features and to acquaint the viewer with the significance of the finding of the court in that obscenity trial. Does this sound overly ambitious and complex? Well yes, but this is a fairly complex poem, expressing the counter-culture movement of the late 1950s and early 1960s. It is a poem, inspired by Walt Whitman&#8217;s Leaves of Grass, that celebrates the life forces pushing against the constraints of social demands and conformity. Well how do the directors convey all of this?  In this film they use several techniques, all of which added together conveyed a powerful story. Allen Ginsberg, the poet, gives an interview to an unseen person and during that interview the viewer sees, in black and white, much of the personal context of the film. These black and white segments include a dramatic reading of the poem by Ginsberg in a nightclub and this reading of the poem is enhanced by animation depicting key passages of the poem. These scenes are integrated with scenes from the obscenity trial around the publishing and sale of this poem in book form, which allows the directors to convey a commentary of the strengths and challenges that surround this poem. I would not say that this film is a general audience film. It is a film for a specific audience of persons who would appreciate the creativity, the freedom, the sexual liberation, and the joy of life that are features of this long four part poem. I came away from the film with a much more enhanced understanding of how the beat culture of the 1950s was the foundations upon which the free love culture of the 1970s and the gay liberation movement of the 1980s were built. I also came away from the film with more understanding of Ginsberg&#8217;s ground breaking efforts to reflect the youth culture in which he lived and loved.

1383740,A3UM5IR9AZL1WZ,B0042U9B3G,"David Crumm ""Editor of ReadTheSpirit magazine""","[7, 9]","As a journalist, I spent time covering Allen Ginsberg during a tour he made in the early 1980s, a time when he almost seemed to have turned himself into a popular little lawn gnome in American culture. Ginsberg always loved to celebrate and poke fun at himself and the culture that both rejected and eventually enjoyed him. He loved to dance, play his little harmonium as he performed and when I encountered him, he drew a big crowd of university students mostly curious to see the '60s celebrity who had managed to survive.But Ginsberg, years before Harvey Milk, was a subversive genius and ""Howl"" finally puts the howl back in Ginsberg's work.I agree with most of the other reviews on the Amazon page, but would stress a few helpful things: First, you get to experience the entire performance of ""Howl"" in the course of this film. That's a rare experience these days. James Franco performs it in scenes that recreate that first explosive reading in San Francisco in 1955. In the Extras, Ginsberg himself reads it. Plus, this is the entire version of ""Howl,"" including the ""Footnote to Howl,"" which I think and most literary scholars think is an essential part of the poem. It's amazing that sometimes ""Howl"" is read or assigned in classes without that Footnote.The truly subversive choice in ""Howl"" was casting two of the hottest heartthrobs in America as the leading characters. The courageous defense lawyer at the ""Howl"" trial is played by Jon Hamm, better known to millions as Don Draper in the hit ""Mad Men"" TV series. The defense lawyer Hamm plays in ""Howl""---from his looks to his prophetic message to the court about American values---is almost a twin to the character of Don Draper. Then, to portray Ginsberg, the producers chose Franco. While Franco may not rank with Brad Pitt on tabloid covers, he's certainly hot today. For example, he appears as one of the hunkiest heartthrobs in Julia Roberts' new movie version of ""Eat Pray Love."" Trying to place Franco in ""Eat Pray Love""? He's the knock-em-dead young actor who tells a girlfriend: ""When I look at you, I can hear dolphins clapping."" Obviously, that sappy line wasn't penned by Ginsberg. Watching those two actors at the helm of ""Howl""---that casting choice alone---drives home the film's plea for diversity. Two of the coolest hearthrobs in America right now see the enduring value in what Ginsberg achieved more than half a century ago.Ginsberg certainly was as much a self-styled clown as a prophet. But, he realized years before many others of his generation that--even from the margins of our society--words are a perpetual source of power. He shouted out this truth at the very end of Howl. Even the language of the Footnote is R-rated, but those final lines should echo on for years to come. The passage includes:Holy! Holy! Holy! Holy! Holy! Holy!The world is holy! The soul is holy! The skin is holy!Everything is holy! everybody's holy! everywhere is holy! everyday is in eternity! Everyman's an angel!The bum's as holy as the seraphim! the madman is holy as you my soul are holy!...Holy forgiveness! mercy! charity! faith! Holy! Ours! bodies! suffering! magnanimity!Holy the supernatural extra brilliant intelligent kindness of the soul!This is a great film.

It is a work of mystery and passion, compelling and beguiling in its intensity and hidden history. This film lifts some of the veil, and presents the poem in its historical and personal contexts, alternating between four settings - Ginsberg (as dramatized by actor James Franco) creating his poem at home and reading it in a fabled '50s Beat gathering; Ginsberg speaking to an interviewer in 1957, as the poem was put on trial in a San Francisco courtroom; the courtroom where an all-star cast digs with glee into their roles -- prosecutor, defender, experts and judge; and finally in a series of animated sequences based on the works of cartoonist Eric Drooker.The context is welcome: Ginsberg always presented himself as a profoundly human figure, but having some of the signposts of his life made plain greatly enhances one's appreciation of a poem that may have seemed fully formed from the head of postwar America - the personal meaning of the poem, as opposed to its political and literary meaning, is illuminating.

The work obviously inspired extreme passions: the audience listen in rapt attention to a work that depicts the poet's feelings through an earthy yet compelling idiom.  In an attempt to show how the poem might work, directors Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman introduce a series of animated sequences; none of them try to 'explain' the work, but rather show how Ginsberg's language works associatively, inspiring moods rather than following any logical sequence.  When the work was first published in the mid-Fifities, it was the subject of a famous obscenity trial: Epstein and Friedman restage that trial, showing how the poem was criticized for its apparent earthiness of language, and then cleared on the grounds that Ginsberg was only following the principle of free speech.  HOWL is an enthralling piece, encouraging viewers not to 'understand' the significance of the poem in terms of meaning, but to see it as symptomatic of a particular moment in American history, when old taboos and/or standards of moral or civilized behavior were subject to intense scrutiny.  The conservatism of the early Fifties had been superseded by a new spirit of adventure, encapsulated in Ginsberg's work, that looked forward to the spirit of the Sixties.

Yes, it indeed is a study of the creator of that significant poem - Allen Ginsberg - but the film seems to be more focused on bringing the audience to a level of appreciation of the impact that particular poem had on the world  - of censorship, of bringing to the attention the parameters of varieties of sexuality and emotions, of the so called concept and rise of the Beat Generation - than it  is in portraying the life history of the poet himself.  Writers/directors Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman  have combined archival footage of the real Allen Ginsberg and  moments in the caf&eacute;s where Howl was read along with very fine animation to relate the grotesque feelings of the poem in a way that enhances our understanding of this important work, and with that they have gathered an exemplary cast of actors to recreate the people that surrounded Ginsberg's life and experience with the courts.The film begin with the 1957 obscenity trial held for the 1955 creation of the poem Howl: the Judge Clayton Horn (Bob Balaban) hears the prosecutor Ralph McIntosh (David Strathairn) bring testimony from a variety of 'experts' - Gail Potter (Mary-Louise Parker), Professor David Kirk (Jeff Daniels), Luther Nichols (Alessandro Nivola), and Mark Shorer (Treat Williams), and then hears rebuttal from Ginsberg's attorney Jake Ehrlich (Jon Hamm) who is also defending Ginsberg's publisher Lawrence Ferlinghetti (Andrew Rogers).  And while the trial proceeds the audience is taken back to the year of the poem's creation with Allen Ginsberg portrayed with exceptionally fine acting by James Franco.  Ginsberg relates his mother's insanity and the effect of  him, his own hospitalization for insanity, and his coming out with lovers Neal Cassady (Jon Prescott), Jack Kerouac (Todd Rotondi), and  Peter Orlovsky (Aaron Tveit). Each of these actors offer polished portrayals and truly give a sense of the meaning of a counterculture that emerged as a result of Ginsberg's masterpiece poem.One of the beauties of this film is that it offers the audience  all the information  about this period and this event and this poet with astute brevity (the film lasts only 84 minutes), making the impact all the more personal.  James Franco as Ginsberg, whether reading Howl or responding to an off camera interviewer, is a completely realized performance.  Time will prove what an important film this is.

He did lead a very interesting life though,and yes, I would call his work revolutionary.This film takes place during his indecency trial (Yes, they actually took him to court over it!),regarding the controversy around his career-defining 4-part poem...""HOWL"", which shook up theestablishment of 1950's America pretty good! (-:(I just love people who upset the established order of things!)During the course of this trial, James Franco, musing as Ginsberg, recants the storyof his life up until that point. Franco really INHABITS young Allen Ginsberg in this!It's very impressive and completely haunting to see.The film maker uses multiple mediums; color, black and white, animation,interesting editing, etc., to co-sign along with the acting performances, and Franco's narrative,enhancing the viewing experience even further.James Franco has really established himself in modern times, as an actor of amazing range,depth, and versatility....and, may I also add, fearlessness to that equasion as well.There is nothing that this guy can't do, and do well, it seems!I have a lot of his more popular works, as well as many of his indie performances.Not counting that dismal 2011 Oscars fiasco, which I think was more a faux pasof the writers and producers of that show than anything! (-:I must also add that Jon Hamm and David Strathairn were great in their supporting roles.Gus Van Sant served as one of the executive producers of this noteworthy indie film.Again, it's not for the masses, but for a smaller, more informed, esoteric audience.I liked it very much.  **4 Stars**",4,Uniquely Bold & Different!!---James Franco Turns In Another Brilliant Performance!!,1312416000,"08 4, 2011",2011,1910,"['First', 'just', 'want', 'say', 'are', 'not', 'familiar', 'avant', 'garde', 'poetry', 'beatnik', 'generation', 'works', 'Allen', 'Ginsberg', 'know', 'little', 'story', 'then', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'lost', 'watching', 'film.I', 'learned', 'Ginsberg', 'time', 'ago', 'was', 'never', 'poet', 'hadmore', 'cursory', 'knowledge', 'did', 'lead', 'very', 'interesting', 'life', 'yes', 'would', 'call', 'work', 'revolutionary.This', 'film', 'place', 'indecency', 'trial', 'Yes', 'actually', 'took', 'court', 'regarding', 'controversy', 'career-defining', '4-part', 'poem', 'HOWL', 'shook', 'up', 'theestablishment', '1950', 'America', 'pretty', 'good', 'just', 'love', 'people', 'who', 'upset', 'established', 'order', 'things', 'course', 'trial', 'James', 'Franco', 'musing', 'Ginsberg', 'storyof', 'life', 'up', 'point', 'Franco', 'really', 'INHABITS', 'young', 'Allen', 'Ginsberg', 'very', 'impressive', 'completely', 'haunting', 'see.The', 'film', 'maker', 'multiple', 'mediums', 'color', 'black', 'white', 'animation', 'interesting', 'editing', 'etc.', 'co-sign', 'acting', 'performances', 'Franco', 'narrative', 'enhancing', 'viewing', 'experience', 'even', 'Franco', 'really', 'established', 'modern', 'times', 'actor', 'amazing', 'range', 'depth', 'versatility', '.and', 'may', 'also', 'add', 'fearlessness', 'equasion', 'well.There', 'nothing', 'guy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'do', 'well', 'have', 'lot', 'more', 'popular', 'works', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'indie', 'performances.Not', 'counting', 'dismal', '2011', 'Oscars', 'fiasco', 'think', 'was', 'more', 'faux', 'pasof', 'writers', 'producers', 'show', 'anything', 'must', 'also', 'add', 'Jon', 'Hamm', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'were', 'great', 'supporting', 'roles.Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'served', 'one', 'executive', 'producers', 'noteworthy', 'indie', 'film.Again', 'not', 'masses', 'smaller', 'more', 'informed', 'esoteric', 'audience.I', 'liked', 'very', 'much', '**4', 'Stars**']",N/A

I've read numerous books both by and about him and the other ""Beat"" writers, and have always thought they were the literary equivalent of Jackson Pollack and the modern painters championed by the likes of Frank O'Hara; artists who belong to the ""Emperor's New Clothes"" School, whose art is all too often much ado about nothing.Co-writer/directors Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman are Oscar winning documentary filmmakers, and perhaps that has gotten in their way.  One could easily imagine a brilliant satire based on the actual testimony of the obscenity trials surrounding the publication and distribution of Ginsberg's slim poetry collection ""Howl""; instead what we get is lots of cross cutting back and forth between courtroom scenes, simulated interviews, poetry readings, and flashbacks from Ginsberg's life and relationships with Jack Kerouac, Neal Cassidy and longtime companion Peter Orlovksy.  As a result ""Howl"" lacks dramatic tension and suspense; even the verdict's rendering, which should be the film's crowd pleasing climax, is rather devoid of passion.This is by no means a wholly negative review, for the subject matter alone commands our interest and many of the film's component parts are exceptional, especially the cinematography of Edward Lachman, the film editing of Jake Pushinsky and the truly inspired and often stunning animation of Eric Drooker (based largely on his equally brilliant illustrations for Ginsberg's ""Illuminated Poems"").  Epstein and Friedman have adroitly populated their film with great character actors like Bob Balaban, David Strathairn, Treat Williams, Mary Louise Parker and Jeff Daniels, who deliver sterling performances in roles that range from small to mere cameos.  As Ginsberg, James Franco does a fine job of reproducing the poet's look, speech patterns and mannerisms; and yet the film doesn't truly present him with an opportunity to bring the character alive emotionally.This is rich material.  However, this viewer felt as though the filmmaker's settled for golden nuggets when El Dorado was within their reach.

The only part that doesn't work - and fails miserably - are the animated sequences that attempt to visualize ""Howl,"" which come across as a clumsy and overly literal gross on the text.

On an old typewriter, Allen begins writing Howl: ""I saw the finest minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked..."" (Really, Allen, you commoner, wherever did you meet such exceptionals? Don't you rate yourself as one of them?) Sketchily, Jack Kerouac, Neal Cassady, and Peter Orlovsky appear. There is no dialog, only Allen's (James Franco's) voiceover.(2) In b&w.; In a narrow brick-walled venue, Allen reads aloud his breakthru long poem to a small clustered rapt audience. Even with his stentorian no-acting-future delivery, his rhythmic patterns, we realize, come naturally to him, the sign of a poet-born. When he introduces ""Moloch,"" there's a noticeable slip into over-dramatization. In the course of the film, the whole poem is read, even the so-called Footnote sequence. [This stuff is free online.](3) In color. Second-rate animation sequences, designed by Eric Drooper and executed in US and Thailand studios, occupy the screen during some of the poem reading. Dark cityscapes, a gaunt fleeing man, naked hetero couples screwing in the dense sky, white meteoric men whizzing thru the air, marching ranks of grim soldiers, and a red Moloch worthy of DeMille. One just KNOWS this Fantasia outtake never unreeled in Allen's mind.(4) In color. At the obscenity trial, Allen is absent, for publisher Lawrence Ferlinghetti is the accused. In this ""landmark"" proceeding, neither the prosecutor (David Strathairn) nor the defense lawyer (John Hamm) has much on the ball; the same may be said of the ""expert"" witnesses. Undoubtedly as directed, all restrict themselves to ho-hum delivery. (Well, how can anyone rev up in 1957 for that legal rarity: an Obscenity Trial! I'm sure Lady Chatterley's was much better.)(5) In color. In some later year, Allen is interviewed in his unspecial apartment by a man who remains off-camera. Allen recalls, in lackadaisical voice, the process of writing Howl.

Told from Ginsberg's perspective it isn't formatted like a usual movie, but more like a poem with different alternating stanzas.The stanzas breakdown into an interview with Ginsberg circa 1957, an animated rendition of Howl, the trial, the Six Gallery reading that brought the beats and Howl to mass public awareness, Ginsberg writing Howl, and his meeting and falling in love with Peter Orlovsky.James Franco plays Ginsberg and while not a nuanced or fiery performance you do get the feeling of what it would be like at the time of the obscenity trial to sit down with Ginsberg and talk about Howl, from how it got started to what it meant to him to write it, and the literary merits of it.The stanzas mesh seamlessly, and intricately. For instance, the animated Howl that is interspersed with the live action works very well on its own but also in the context of the movie. If you're not familiar with the poem it provides a reference point as to what the controversy was in the first place. The trial scenes with Jon Hamm as Ferlinghetti's defense lawyer, and David Strathairn as the prosecutor provide comic relief, especially more so because the dialog was taken right from the trial transcripts. If obscenity trials are good for anything it's getting straitlaced attorneys to say things that in a different context would be considered obscene.The movie also doesn't avoid or ignore Ginsberg's homosexuality. As a matter of fact, it's an intricate part of the movie since Howl was Ginsberg's first flash of accepting that within himself as being a part of himself, and normal.All the performances in ""Howl"" are good. Everyone delivers even if they aren't asked to do much except ""be"" the characters they`re supposed to be. Most of the attention is focused on Franco as Ginsberg and he proves that there's more to his acting than what's seen in franchise movies such as ""Spiderman.""",4,Poem Of A Movie,1285977600,"10 2, 2010",2010,1997,"['Howl', 'story', 'obscenity', 'trial', 'surrounding', 'Lawrence', 'Ferlinghetti', 'publishing', 'Allen', 'Ginsburg', 'Howl', 'Told', 'Ginsberg', 'perspective', ""n't"", 'formatted', 'usual', 'movie', 'more', 'poem', 'different', 'alternating', 'stanzas.The', 'stanzas', 'breakdown', 'interview', 'Ginsberg', 'circa', '1957', 'animated', 'rendition', 'Howl', 'trial', 'Six', 'Gallery', 'reading', 'brought', 'beats', 'Howl', 'mass', 'public', 'awareness', 'Ginsberg', 'writing', 'Howl', 'meeting', 'falling', 'love', 'Peter', 'Orlovsky.James', 'Franco', 'Ginsberg', 'not', 'nuanced', 'fiery', 'performance', 'do', 'get', 'feeling', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'time', 'obscenity', 'trial', 'sit', 'down', 'Ginsberg', 'talk', 'Howl', 'how', 'got', 'started', 'what', 'meant', 'write', 'literary', 'merits', 'it.The', 'stanzas', 'mesh', 'seamlessly', 'intricately', 'instance', 'animated', 'Howl', 'interspersed', 'live', 'action', 'very', 'well', 'own', 'also', 'context', 'movie', ""'re"", 'not', 'familiar', 'poem', 'reference', 'point', 'what', 'controversy', 'was', 'first', 'place', 'trial', 'scenes', 'Jon', 'Hamm', 'Ferlinghetti', 'defense', 'lawyer', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'prosecutor', 'provide', 'comic', 'relief', 'especially', 'more', 'so', 'dialog', 'was', 'taken', 'right', 'trial', 'transcripts', 'obscenity', 'trials', 'are', 'good', 'anything', 'getting', 'straitlaced', 'attorneys', 'say', 'things', 'different', 'context', 'would', 'be', 'considered', 'obscene.The', 'movie', 'also', ""n't"", 'avoid', 'ignore', 'Ginsberg', 'homosexuality', 'matter', 'fact', 'intricate', 'part', 'movie', 'Howl', 'was', 'Ginsberg', 'first', 'flash', 'accepting', 'being', 'part', 'performances', 'Howl', 'are', 'good', 'Everyone', 'delivers', 'even', 'are', ""n't"", 'asked', 'do', 'much', 'be', 'characters', 're', 'supposed', 'be', 'Most', 'attention', 'focused', 'Franco', 'Ginsberg', 'more', 'acting', 'what', 'seen', 'franchise', 'movies', 'such', 'Spiderman']",N/A
1383757,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0042U9B3G,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[33, 37]","How do you bring the written word alive on the screen?  ""Howl,"" in depicting the famous Allen Ginsberg poem, does so ingeniously.  But the beauty of the poem is interspersed with scenes of a much more conventional nature as well.  The film is divided into four specific segments--the 1957 obscenity trial, a famed 1957 interview with Ginsberg (played ably by James Franco), the 1955 public unveiling of the masterwork ""Howl,"" and an animated representation of the work in question.  Then there are some flashbacks that accompany the various segments as needed.  It is a lot of material for a film that runs less than ninety minutes.  It is a credit to ""Howl"" that it works so well--but I also wonder if more impact might have been made by limiting the focus somewhat.  Sometimes less is more.  Also, by being so reverent to Ginsberg and the source material (the interview, most noticeably)--ultimately, I felt less emotionally connected to this fascinating character than I'd hoped.It is actually the animation in ""Howl"" that stands out the most.  On some level, I felt that the filmmakers had this inspired idea of how to present ""Howl"" (the poem) in a visually compelling style--but then had to come up with other secondary material to round out a feature film.  The film comes to life with these sequences.  Franco's interpretation as he reads ""Howl"" can be distracting, however.  I know he is channeling Ginsberg, but the awkward cadence of his delivery disrupts the smooth flowing imagery.  A small point, though, because I found the animation in ""Howl"" extraordinary and interesting.  As a small film, on its own, I think it would have been a rousing success and brought ""Howl"" (the poem) to a new generation.The other segments are nice enough.  The 1955 reading and flashback scenes, done in black and white, provide context to Ginsberg and his era (that good ole ""Beatnik"" generation).  We see glimpses of Ginsberg with the various loves of his life--they are fleeting moments, not particularly developed, but they do help to enhance the meaning of ""Howl"" (the poem).  The obscenity trial, which was leveled against the publisher and not Ginsberg (Franco is not even in this part of the film), is pretty standard courtroom fare.  It's well done, if not especially revelatory.  With Jon Hamm, David Strathairn, and Bob Balaban as the court officials and Mary-Louise Parker, Treat Williams, Alessandro Nivola, and Jeff Daniels on the stand--you know it's impressively acted.  It is the interview sequence in which Franco gets to shine.  Franco's frankness is both convincing and illuminating to how Ginsberg conceptualized his poem.  But again, as it is based on transcripts, we learn only as much about Ginsberg personally as he tells us.""Howl"" is a good film with elements of greatness.  My only real disappointment is the biographical element in the film.  Ginsberg's interview documents his journey from normalcy, to a mental institution, to a life in the professional world, to his acceptance of a counterculture.  I'm sure it would make a terrific film in its own right.  But ""Howl"" introduces us to Ginsberg, the man, but never really lets us get close to him.  So as much as I admired the film--ultimately, I was not very connected to it.  Interesting and intellectual, ""Howl"" succeeds best when dealing with ""Howl"" but lacks some of the insight into its author that would have taken the film to the next level.  There were just too many aspects in ""Howl"" introduced to follow them all through.  Courtroom drama, biography, artistic interpretation--it's a lot for a little film.  But I did very much enjoy ""Howl"" and recommend it--especially to those interested in the subject matter!

1383758,A1AQ9R3L8ZWWEC,B0042U9B3G,"LMG ""ancient art prof""","[0, 0]","HOWL is a movie that primarily revolves around an obscenity trial in 1957 concerning the beat poetry of Allen Ginsberg who defied the conventionalism and established mores of the time to become one of the most touted poets of the 20th century. Like his poetry, this movie will not be to everyone's taste. The language and the way it was employed by Ginsberg is certainly not nearly as jarring (if at all) to an early 21st century audience as it was to a mid-1950s one.The poetry aside, what was so important about Ginsberg's trial was what should and should not be considered obscene. The outcome was possibly as significant as the earlier Scopes Monkey trial of 30+ years earlier. What constitutes ""free speech"" in a free society? - a question that is still hauntingly relevant today. The old adage: ""What is one man's meat is another man's poison"" is applicable. What is one person's obscenity maybe another one's pleasure. You don't have to like or even understand Ginsberg's poetry but you have to allow its right to exist.James Franco channels Ginsberg to considerable effect. However, the real stars of the film are those who participate in the trial as judge, prosecutor, defender, or witness.  All the actors who portray these particular roles are outstanding, from Bob Balaban's judge, John Hamm's defence lawyer, David Strathairn as prosecutor, and Jeff Daniels, Treat Williams, and Mary-Louise Parker as witnesses.Aaron Tveit (currently of GRACELAND) plays Ginsberg's lifetime partner in a brief and non-speaking role.The film combines actual footage and dialogue, with its reenactment counterparts, along with strikingand overt animation (perhaps the best part of the movie). In the end, HOWL basically channels its literary namesake and gives us a key slice of Americana (pro and con) in the mid and late 1950s. The reaction to Ginsberg's poetry could easily find its counterpart in the contemporary reaction to the abstract art of the time. The latter was never put on trial for obscenity though many an obscenity was hurled at it. And who today wouldn't wish to own a Jackson Pollock, et al.?Neither the poetry nor this movie will be everyone's ""cup of tea"" but it is worthwile to see in order to better understand the workings and attitudes of our own society and as a mirror of ourselves. My only negative criticism has to do with how the film was put together. It conveys a somewhat disjointed and confusing story by the way it moves back and forth in time, shifts from black & white to color and back, and from live action to animation and back.

Even the slipcase for this DVD is a genuine work of art.Unfortunately, the film is nowheres near to being a genuine work of art.  If a viewer knew absolutely nothing about Ginsberg or Kerouac or Neal Cassady or the Beat Generation or the repressive climate of the '50s or a whole host of other matters vital to what HOWL - both the poem and the movie - is about, they would leave this film just a tiny tad more knowledgeable than before having seen it. And to those who do know much about the topics at hand, the feeling might be more one of loss for all of the missing ingredients to what makes the story of HOWL and its times so trenchant for today.Whilst the poem ""Howl"" is being read beautifully by Franco as Ginsberg in voice-over, the long and silly cartoon sequences only serve to distract from the poem's text.  For one thing, the cartoons are much too modern and slick.  Even if one argues that they are supposed to be modern so that the visionary nature of the poem can be further emphasized, the truth is the cartoon clashes with the climate of the times to the detriment of the live action sequences. Worse, the cartoon vies for artistic predominance - and given that our world today is much more visual than literary, the cartoon more than likely wins attention the majority of times.  What would have worked better as visuals for the reading of the poem, would have been actual newsreel footage of the time, even if simulated.But no matter what was used as visual aid to the poem, the movie itself is primarily surface.  Giants such as Kerouac and Cassady come and go in the blink of an eye - and Lawrence Ferlinghetti, the man who published HOWL and was taken to trial for it - just sits in the courtroom without any illuminative back-story whatsoever.  One of the segments of the ""Making of HOWL"" documentary tells the story of the publication and the trial much better than the main event.  The courtroom drama in this film is minimalist.  Sticking too closely to actual trial transcripts, the full import and impact of the trial in American history is lost on the viewer.  The film actually needed a scriptwriter to evoke and imagine what isn't strictly on the record.  Show us Ferlinghetti publishing the poem and getting arrested for it.  Show us Ginsberg's reactions to the trial, both before and after verdict. Show us more of what the Beat Generation was really like.  And, in the epilogue, don't be willfully mysterious about how Neal Cassady actually died.  Much more is known about his end than is hinted at in the closing caption over his photograph.The Beat Generation is a fascinating period in history.

The non-linear film has a poetic feel as it seems to move at a pace and the rhythm that is in synch with Ginsberg's paradigm-changing poem.James Franco is Allen Ginsberg with nervous passion that is bold and amused at his own bravado and wit. His portrays Ginsberg to be an  unorthodox thinker who is uncomfortable with the time he lives in. The film does not shy away from depicting Ginsberg's sexually charged friendships with Jack Kerouac (Todd Rotondi) and Neal Cassady (Jon Prescott), and his union with Peter Orlovsky (Aaron Tveit).HOWL is an exercise in literary criticism on film. Academics and critics show up in the courtroom drama with Jon Hamm and David Strathairn arguing to defend or discredit the frank discussion of drugs and homosexuality, blasphemous in apocalyptic visions expressed in ""Howl"". Mr. Strathairn's prosecutor confesses that he can't understand what ""Howl"" is about, and the film does not dumb its material down to be more digestable to the taste of an audience that may not be into this form of prose.",3,An acquired HOWL,1382572800,"10 24, 2013",2013,1233,"['HOWL', 'definately', 'film', 'certain', 'acquired', 'taste.Aspiring', 'be', 'authentic', 'tone', 'mood', 'much', 'poetry', 'BEAT', 'generation', 'film', 'long', 'dry', 'montotone', 'delivery', 'non-linear', 'film', 'poetic', 'feel', 'move', 'pace', 'rhythm', 'synch', 'Ginsberg', 'paradigm-changing', 'poem.James', 'Franco', 'Allen', 'Ginsberg', 'nervous', 'passion', 'bold', 'amused', 'own', 'bravado', 'wit', 'portrays', 'Ginsberg', 'be', 'unorthodox', 'thinker', 'who', 'uncomfortable', 'time', 'film', 'not', 'shy', 'away', 'depicting', 'Ginsberg', 'sexually', 'charged', 'friendships', 'Jack', 'Kerouac', 'Todd', 'Rotondi', 'Neal', 'Cassady', 'Jon', 'Prescott', 'union', 'Peter', 'Orlovsky', 'Aaron', 'Tveit', '.HOWL', 'exercise', 'literary', 'criticism', 'film', 'Academics', 'critics', 'show', 'up', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'Jon', 'Hamm', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'arguing', 'defend', 'discredit', 'frank', 'discussion', 'drugs', 'homosexuality', 'blasphemous', 'apocalyptic', 'visions', 'expressed', 'Howl', 'Mr.', 'Strathairn', 'prosecutor', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'Howl', 'about', 'film', 'not', 'dumb', 'material', 'down', 'be', 'more', 'digestable', 'taste', 'audience', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'form', 'prose']",N/A
