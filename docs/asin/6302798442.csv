335788,A1P27BGF8NAI29,6302798442,Alice in Wonderland,"[1, 1]","Ruby Carter is drawn to the Tiger Kid, a prize fighter on his way to the top. But, when Tiger's trainer successfully plants it in Tiger's head that Ruby is cheating on him, he turns on her. Ruby is not the sort to pine for any man, so she takes a new job singing in New Orleans. But, her new employer, Ace Lamont is looking to throw over his old girlfriend for Ruby.Ruby knows Ace is no good, and after her diamonds are stolen, she quickly realizes that it is Ace behind the theft. Ruby is nobody's fool, and she plots her revenge, but before all is said and done somebody is going to die.This is Mae West's fourth movie, and is admittedly not her best. The music for the film was provided by the incomparable Duke Ellington, and is excellent. Mae herself is great - shining like a diamond in her excellent wardrobe, and pulling out the great one-liners that everyone seems to remember. The weakest part of the film, though, has to be the ending. After the fatal occurrence, it seems as though the writers and director did not know what to do with the story, and wrapped it up with a pretty but ill-fitting bow. If you watch it, you'll know what I mean.But, that said, this is an enjoyable movie, and another chance to see Mae West in her prime.(Review of Belle of the Nineties starring Mae West)",4,An enjoyable movie,1269820800,"03 29, 2010",2010,1296,"['Ruby', 'Carter', 'drawn', 'Tiger', 'Kid', 'prize', 'fighter', 'way', 'top', 'when', 'Tiger', 'trainer', 'successfully', 'plants', 'Tiger', 'head', 'Ruby', 'cheating', 'Ruby', 'not', 'sort', 'pine', 'man', 'new', 'job', 'singing', 'New', 'Orleans', 'new', 'employer', 'Ace', 'Lamont', 'looking', 'throw', 'over', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'Ruby.Ruby', 'knows', 'Ace', 'good', 'diamonds', 'are', 'stolen', 'quickly', 'Ace', 'theft', 'Ruby', 'nobody', 'fool', 'plots', 'revenge', 'said', 'done', 'somebody', 'going', 'die.This', 'Mae', 'West', 'fourth', 'movie', 'admittedly', 'not', 'best', 'music', 'film', 'was', 'provided', 'incomparable', 'Duke', 'Ellington', 'excellent', 'Mae', 'great', 'shining', 'diamond', 'excellent', 'wardrobe', 'pulling', 'out', 'great', 'one-liners', 'everyone', 'remember', 'weakest', 'part', 'film', 'though', 'be', 'ending', 'fatal', 'occurrence', 'writers', 'director', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'story', 'wrapped', 'up', 'pretty', 'ill-fitting', 'bow', 'watch', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', 'mean.But', 'said', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'chance', 'see', 'Mae', 'West', 'prime', 'Review', 'Belle', 'Nineties', 'starring', 'Mae', 'West']",Belle of the Nineties VHS

Valero ""Eterno""","[3, 3]","West plays a flamboyant singer Ruby Carter who after breaking up with her boxer boyfriend, takes a job singing at a fashionable club in New Orleans. She quickly becomes the object of desire for the area's male population and an object of envy and scorn by one of the females.Mae West is splendidly dressed thoughout with over the top plumes, hat's, jewels and form fitting gowns. Despite her age and size, she's quite an eye-catcher and her charming, sex-crazed personality intrigues and delights. She also sings much loved tunes such as MY OLD FLAME and ST LOUIS WOMAN backed by Duke Ellington and his orchestra.Mae West's one-liners and innuendos were toned-down and they were no where near as sexual as in her first starring feature SHE DONE HIM WRONG. The Production Code that came in effect at around this time was pretty strict and as a result, this film was said to have been heavily edited. Some of Mae's best lines were left out and the original title IT AIN'T NO SIN was changed to the more inoffensive BELLE OF THE NINETIES. Despite all this, BELLE OF THE NINETIES still offers some of her best dialogue and witty one-liners.When West is asked ""What type of men you prefer?"". She replies ""Only two. Domestic and foreign.""When John Miljan goes to greet her as she exits her boat, Mae (as usual) is surrounded by men. ""Take care of these men"" says Miljan. Mae adds, ""Yes, give them all my address.""When one of her male admirers states ""Ruby I must have you. Your golden hair, your fascinating smile,  your lovely arms, your form, devine"". She quickly quips ""What is this a proposal or are you taking inventory?.""And even her maid get's some useful advice when West tells her ""Don't let a man ever put anything over on you outside of an umbrella.""And one of her best lines ""Better to be looked over than over-looked"" is featured here.The curvacious blonde is all style, all substance and originality and her lines are performed with a sexual ""purr"" that would have even Catwoman taking notes. BELLE OF THE NINETIES is one of Mae West's most entertaining flicks. It's blown-up, brazen and pleasurable. Just like the lady herself.",5,Entertaining West Vehicle.
