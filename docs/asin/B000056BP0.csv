568789,A3EBHHCZO6V2A4,B000056BP0,"Amaranth ""music fan""","[1, 1]","""The Passion of Ayn Rand"" is a fascinating made-for-TV movie about the complicated love life of the author/philosopher. Ayn Rand, originally Alice Rosenbaum, had fled the Soviet Union&its; oppression, creating a new life&a; new name for herself in the United States. Helen Mirren is electrifying as Rand, be she commanding her followers to embrace capitalism, or broken down when she realizes her protege has betrayed her. Mirren's Russian accent is superb in this film--too bad she didn't use it when she was the equally commanding Sofia Tolstoy inThe Last Station. Ayn Rand's husband, painter Frank O'Connor (a haunting performance from Peter Fonda) lives in her shadow- and ironically, as Leo Tolstoy was financially dependent on Sofia, so was O'Connor dependent on her.In the beginning, Ayn Rand makes an arranged marriage sorts of between Nathaniel Brandon (Eric Stoltz,Caprica: Season 1.0) and Barbara (Julie Delpy,at her most tragic) She fails to see the lack of chemistry between the pair... and decides to step in, calling for an open marriage. Ayn Rand&Nathaniel; embark on a passionate affair... considering that Ayn was 25 years Nathaniel's senior. Mirren portrays Ayn as an impassioned woman, who loves an aggressive man- she chides O'Connor for being too gentle a lover. Nathaniel acts as her Muse of Fire, enabling her to write her epicAtlas ShruggedHowever, Nathaniel himself has as voracious an ego, cheating on his wife&his; older mistress with a homely patient/ballerina, Caroline. The love foursquare becomes a pentagon- and it wreaks havoc. In the end, Ayn is a broken woman. Mirren's final rant to Stoltz would be echoed a decade later as Sofia Tolstoy reminding her husband Leo (Christopher Plummer) how she provided him with everything- his writing, his home, his children. Helen Mirren brings the passion to ""The Passion of Ayn Rand.""It's an OK film rather than a perfect one because Ayn Rand is often displaced by Nathaniel's narrative.  Eric Stoltz gets plenty of love scenes, but he lacks Helen Mirren's passion. Julie Delpy has a strikingly unique role as the wronged wife--but it often comes across as wimpy. Peter Fonda is paternal towards Delpy- and one wonders if Ayn requested the open marriage because she assumed her husband&Barbara; were fooling around. Barbara romances a trumpeter&they; end up happily together- without much explanation. Much is made of Ayn Rand's worship of capitalism, but it briefly touches on her disdain for conservatives (whom she deemed nostalgic&sentimental;) and Ronald Reagan (whom she preferred as an actor) She says she is neither liberal nor conservative, but alone. Ayn Rand's complicated theories on love, marriage and sexuality are touched upon but not fully explored. Then there's the boring jazz score. It's repetitive&would; work better playing at a supermarket.

It merely was a soap opera about her, her milquetoast husband, and a couple of what today would be considered yuppies. It also missed a huge opportunity to explore a major theme that it brought up: how people who advocate complete selfishness can sustain (or not) long-term romantic relationships.Helen Mirren was fabulous in her portrayal of Rand, rising above the lacking script, and actually made her rather likable in an odd way.  On the other hand, Eric Stoltz' character was totally unlikable and unredeeming, and due to the deficiencies of the script I could never understand what Rand saw in him either intellectually or romantically.Smooth, cool jazz and gorgeous nighttime views of Manhattan added to the ambiance, but overall this film came up wanting.  It began with the Julie Delpy character's voiceover (at the time of Rand's death in the '80s) saying she had ""loved"" Rand, but we were never shown why this could be so.

I just don't think the movie is good enough.It's not a *bad* movie either, but to people new to Rand and her movement, it comes across as relatively incomprehensible. You don't get a real feel for her ideas, her novels, or her background. Perhaps I feel this way because I live in Sweden, where Rand is almost unknown (even I was initially confused by the movie, and I know more about her than the average Svensson).Maybe Americans, who know some of the background, can look differently at ""The Passion of Ayn Rand""? Of course, the actors are brilliant, but that's another show.Personally, I call the movie ""The nude body of Helen Mirren"". LOL! The sex is very explicit. Apparently, Barbara Brandon (who wrote the book the movie is based on) was somewhat disappointed by the sheer number of sex scenes. But I guess it's difficult to make a movie about Rand without a lot of sex, since her love life was notoriously messy, and also affected the leadership of her movement.

It made a strong impression on me at the time, but I can hardly remember anything about it now. The Gary Cooper film I only recall as being pretty poor. I have since tried to get through Atlas Shrugged, but it was so badly written I couldn't complete it; and I still don't know what it is about. However, I've met one or two Rand fanatics, and therefore bought this dvd. This review is only concerned with the film as a work of interest and entertainment, not with the pros and cons of Rand's Weltanschauung. It seems to me an absorbing movie, with an incredible performance by Helen Mirren. On this evidence she impresses me as one of the greatest of living actresses. The story, however, seems extremely unedifying. Three wishy-washy personalities are presented as falling under the total dominance of an extraordinarily self-centred woman, with the hint that she is driven by a demonic need to exorcise the memory of her childhood traumas in Soviet Russia. She is only two-dimensional, however, and appears to lack a stabilizing emotional third leg. The characters she controls are very typical of those that fall victim to the various strange cults which seem to spring up with disconcerting frequency in the USA. In very many films and books this society appears over-intense, empty and humourless, with a fatal inability to laugh at itself. At the end of the film the Fonda character mutters that he never knew what it was all about, which just about sums it up.",4,Mirren mesmerizes,1091404800,"08 2, 2004",2004,1578,"['Ayn', 'Rand', 'have', 'made', 'mark', 'sorts', '20th', 'century', 'America', 'read', 'Fountainhead', 'about', '1959', 'made', 'strong', 'impression', 'time', 'can', 'hardly', 'remember', 'anything', 'now', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'film', 'only', 'recall', 'being', 'pretty', 'poor', 'have', 'tried', 'get', 'Atlas', 'Shrugged', 'was', 'so', 'badly', 'written', 'could', ""n't"", 'complete', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'about', 'However', ""'ve"", 'met', 'one', 'two', 'Rand', 'fanatics', 'therefore', 'bought', 'dvd', 'review', 'only', 'concerned', 'film', 'work', 'interest', 'entertainment', 'not', 'pros', 'cons', 'Rand', 'Weltanschauung', 'absorbing', 'movie', 'incredible', 'performance', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'evidence', 'one', 'greatest', 'living', 'actresses', 'story', 'however', 'extremely', 'unedifying', 'Three', 'wishy-washy', 'personalities', 'are', 'presented', 'falling', 'total', 'dominance', 'extraordinarily', 'self-centred', 'woman', 'hint', 'driven', 'demonic', 'need', 'exorcise', 'memory', 'childhood', 'traumas', 'Soviet', 'Russia', 'only', 'two-dimensional', 'however', 'lack', 'stabilizing', 'emotional', 'third', 'leg', 'characters', 'controls', 'are', 'very', 'typical', 'fall', 'victim', 'various', 'strange', 'cults', 'seem', 'spring', 'up', 'disconcerting', 'frequency', 'USA', 'very', 'many', 'films', 'books', 'society', 'over-intense', 'empty', 'humourless', 'fatal', 'inability', 'laugh', 'end', 'film', 'Fonda', 'character', 'mutters', 'never', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'just', 'sums', 'up']",N/A

Especially since she has spent years teaching her followers to emulate her ""be honest to your inmost desires junk.""Once he has betrayed her relationship to him, just as she betrayed her relationship to her husband, her publicly being shown to not be in total control drives her to punish him publicly & once again demonstrate her ability to get the upper hand.That a movie was made on this person is questionable. Especially since she was popularized by the ""I don't know who I am crowd."" The thought of the people led into her waste of human life philosophy & how long it may have taken them to recover is unsettling. I give the subject of this movie a 1 star rating. The story (for accuracy) & acting are 5 stars.Lot's of people probably believe this story is about human sexual relations. It's not.

I am a disciple of Rand who really loved the Barbara Branden book.  I believe what Branden wrote about Rand, because her portrait of Ayn is complete and consistent.  Rand's passion for ideas made her testy with stupid people and willing to break social norms such as those that govern how married people behave.  Those objectivists who wish to dismiss this book and film as slander ought to look in the mirror.  You are just as stubborn and dogmatic as she.Which isn't to say she isn't the greatest mind of the 20th century, because she is.  Her ideas changed my life.  It's the absense of any real discussion of those ideas that sinks this movie.  There's are just enough bits of objectivist rhetoric to make Rand sound the leader of a bizarre cult.  Only the final scene where she speaks to a group of her disciples and critics does her justice.  She sparkles with wit and antagonism while confidently defending every attack on her unique philosophy.Not surprisingly this is the image I took away from Branden's original book which has several hundred pages to flesh out the Rand's complete and at times flawed character.Without much philosophy to lean on for support, this movie seems pretty unbelievable.  The acting is great of course, its a dream cast.  A better script and a director less attracted to the dirt of the story could have made this truly special, an emotionally powerful film about ideas.Chris Spaeth",3,"Great Woman, So-So Movie",1000944000,"09 20, 2001",2001,1496,"['like', 'think', ""'m"", 'qualified', 'quot', 'objectively', 'quot', 'review', 'film', 'am', 'disciple', 'Rand', 'who', 'really', 'loved', 'Barbara', 'Branden', 'book', 'believe', 'what', 'Branden', 'wrote', 'Rand', 'portrait', 'Ayn', 'complete', 'consistent', 'Rand', 'passion', 'ideas', 'made', 'testy', 'stupid', 'people', 'willing', 'break', 'social', 'norms', 'such', 'govern', 'how', 'married', 'people', 'behave', 'objectivists', 'who', 'wish', 'dismiss', 'book', 'film', 'slander', 'ought', 'look', 'mirror', 'are', 'just', 'stubborn', 'dogmatic', 'she.Which', ""n't"", 'say', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'mind', '20th', 'century', 'ideas', 'changed', 'life', 'absense', 'real', 'discussion', 'ideas', 'sinks', 'movie', 'are', 'just', 'enough', 'bits', 'objectivist', 'rhetoric', 'make', 'Rand', 'sound', 'leader', 'bizarre', 'cult', 'Only', 'final', 'scene', 'where', 'group', 'disciples', 'critics', 'justice', 'wit', 'antagonism', 'confidently', 'defending', 'attack', 'unique', 'philosophy.Not', 'surprisingly', 'image', 'took', 'away', 'Branden', 'original', 'book', 'several', 'hundred', 'pages', 'flesh', 'out', 'Rand', 'complete', 'times', 'flawed', 'character.Without', 'much', 'philosophy', 'lean', 'support', 'movie', 'pretty', 'unbelievable', 'acting', 'great', 'course', 'dream', 'cast', 'better', 'script', 'director', 'less', 'attracted', 'dirt', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'truly', 'special', 'emotionally', 'powerful', 'film', 'ideas.Chris', 'Spaeth']",N/A

By the age of nine, it is said that she knew she wanted to dedicate her life to writing and to philosophy.Russia of the times was focused in collectivism, something Ayn Rand despised. After reading the works of Victor Hugo her character starts to shape. She lived through the Kerensky Revolution and in 1917, through the Bolshevik Revolution. From the start, she denounced communism and when the revolutionaries are victorious and start the painstaking process of taking away property, confiscating the pharmacy her father owned, she decides Russia is not the country for her. The family undergoes poverty and lack of food. While at school, during a class of American History, Ayn develops the ardent desire to become an American citizen. The United States becomes her goal because she wants to join a nation of free men and women, where the rights of the individual are protected by its constitution.The university where she was studying philosophy is overtaken by communists, but during her last years of study; she enjoys one great pleasure, watching Western films and plays, and decides to enter the State Institute for Cinema Arts to study screenwriting.Finally, she is permitted to leave Soviet Russia and to visit the United States. Her trip was supposed to last a short time, but she was determined never to return to Russia. New York City, with its skyscrapers, thousand lights, and never ending activity becomes the city that shapes her interpretation of the finest achievements of humanity.For a while, following her acting career, she travels to Hollywood and meets Cecil B. DeMille, who offers this striking young woman, with piercing eyes, a ride to the set of his movie The King of Kings. Mr. DeMille gives her an opportunity, her first job in the USA, as an extra, a script reader.She meets actor Frank O'Connor and they strike interesting conversations that result in a marriage until death did they part. She writes The Fountainhead, where she shapes a hero by the name of Howard Roark, an architect, an ideal man that reveals to the world a philosopher that clearly sees how ""a man ought to be."" She then moves to write Atlas Shrugged, a novel that shares her philosophy through a story, surfacing the concept of objectivism, or how to live on Planet Earth.Passion is not our favorite view to Ayn Rand. The DVD offers an interpretation of her affair to Nathaniel Branden, but to see how she relates to him and to his wife is sad and almost made us feel that she used her superior wit and intellect to shape these relationships into calculated displays of weak characters.

Although both were married, Nathaniel Branden and Rand had an affair that went on for 14 years. During the affair, Rand named Nathaniel Branden as her ""intellectual heir"", but this changed when the affair ended under acrimonious circumstances.This is a very well made film with excellent actors in all parts.

The rest of the cast is fine; the script -- which should have been called ""The Panic Attacks of Barbara Branden"" or ""The Affairs of Nathaniel Branden"" -- assumes the viewer already knows everything about Ayn Rand's fiction and philosophy.  This is a big problem.  For example, near the beginning the Brandens are shown meeting Ayn Rand and her husband at their home in California.  This brief scene then cuts to the young couple driving away, filled with excitement about the hours they've just spent talking with their idol, Ayn Rand.  Unfortunately the viewer isn't given a clue as to what their all-night conversation was about.This film would've been far more interesting if the focus had been more on Rand and her ideas, not mainly on the sex between her and Nathaniel Branden, or on Barbara's fainting spells.  There should have been at least two or three scenes between Rand and the Brandens, or with Rand giving speeches or interviews, that would serve to clarify what her ideas were and why they attracted and influenced so many people in the 1950s and 60s.  (There is one brief exchange of dialogue at an Objectivist lecture where Rand answers a question about her core beliefs by stating: ""Reason.  Individualism.  Capitalism."", but that's all we get to hear, folks.)  Otherwise the film makes it difficult to understand why Rand became such a magnetic cult-figure and was able to command such devotion from her friends and followers.Once again: see it for Mirren's performance, but try to imagine a better script.",3,Helen Mirren is Excellent as Ayn Rand -- But What Were Her Ideas?,1275868800,"06 7, 2010",2010,1642,"['Helen', 'Mirren', 'usual', 'excellent', 'performance', 'Ayn', 'Rand', 'main', 'reason', 'see', 'film', 'rest', 'cast', 'fine', 'script', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'called', 'Panic', 'Attacks', 'Barbara', 'Branden', 'Affairs', 'Nathaniel', 'Branden', 'viewer', 'already', 'everything', 'Ayn', 'Rand', 'fiction', 'philosophy', 'big', 'problem', 'example', 'beginning', 'Brandens', 'are', 'shown', 'meeting', 'Ayn', 'Rand', 'husband', 'home', 'California', 'brief', 'scene', 'then', 'young', 'couple', 'driving', 'away', 'filled', 'excitement', 'hours', ""'ve"", 'just', 'spent', 'talking', 'idol', 'Ayn', 'Rand', 'Unfortunately', 'viewer', ""n't"", 'given', 'clue', 'what', 'all-night', 'conversation', 'was', 'about.This', 'film', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'focus', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'Rand', 'ideas', 'not', 'mainly', 'sex', 'Nathaniel', 'Branden', 'Barbara', 'fainting', 'spells', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'least', 'two', 'three', 'scenes', 'Rand', 'Brandens', 'Rand', 'giving', 'speeches', 'interviews', 'would', 'serve', 'clarify', 'what', 'ideas', 'were', 'why', 'attracted', 'influenced', 'so', 'many', 'people', '1950s', '60s', 'one', 'brief', 'exchange', 'dialogue', 'Objectivist', 'lecture', 'where', 'Rand', 'question', 'core', 'beliefs', 'stating', 'Reason', 'Individualism', 'Capitalism', 'get', 'hear', 'folks', 'film', 'difficult', 'understand', 'why', 'Rand', 'became', 'such', 'magnetic', 'cult-figure', 'was', 'able', 'command', 'such', 'devotion', 'friends', 'followers.Once', 'again', 'see', 'Mirren', 'performance', 'try', 'imagine', 'better', 'script']",N/A

The character who suffers most is that of the fine Julie Delpy, some over-the-top histrionics, and Eric Stoltz never amazes (as we know he can) as the catalyst of Rand's resurgence of inspiration. Peter Fonda seems to have become extremely focused in his later years, coming off an Oscar nom for Ulee's Gold, and he is one of the most interesting characters, played very well. I can't say I enjoyed the film, because it, quite simply, wasn't very interesting. Ayn Rand is both loved and loathed by many, and it takes an actress of Mirren's depth and sincerity to pull it off. She does. Rand's idea of objectivism--in essence, every man for himself--is a rather frightening idea, when you think of the chaos that might develop.

He had slept with (or at least simulated sex with) Helen Mirren, Julie Delpy, and Sybil Temchen in the course of making this film. Ah, the sacrifices our finest stars make to bring us top-quality entertainment!Stoltz plays Nathaniel Branden, a protege of Rand's (Mirren) with whom she has an affair, much to the consternation of her husband Frank (Peter Fonda) and his wife Barbara (Delpy). The movie is based on the memoirs of Barbara Branden. Despite that, however, the film doesn't portray any of its principals as evil; it just shows us the events and allows us to judge for ourselves. Sure, there are overtones that strain credulity (the implication is that Rand needed the affair with Branden in order to finish Atlas Shrugged, and because of that, this is as much a film about the writing of that book as it is anything else), but there's no demonizing of either Rand or Branden. That, more than anything, is what saves this movie. It helps that the plot's interesting and the actors are well-suited to it (Delpy and Stoltz, especially, are always a fine pairing), but it is the treatment of the material that separates this from the pack.

The only book of hers I read several times was We The Living as the characters were most like flesh and blood and real.While I was going to Group at Mr. Branden's house I had no idea that he'd had an affair with Ayn Rand as it was apparently known only to some insiders I'd guess. Had I known, I would have immediately ended the relationship. As it was he was totally ineffectual as a therapist, barely able to stay awake while we spoke, and like comic shrinks in movies, lets you answer your own questions when you're paying HIM to! Years later, 15 free minutes with Dr. Laura on the radio fixed the problem I had (guilt over the death of a family member.)The upside of all this:I did know Patrecia who was changed to another fictional woman in the movie. She was a Goddess. All the men loved her, all  the women wanted to BE her. She was the essence of joy and life and she died way too young....slight epilepsy that was caused by strobing sunlight dancing off the pool whereupon she had a seizure and fell into the water, drowning.Now I see that the high moral standards we underlings were supposed to uphold were completely tossed out the window by Ms. Rand and Mr. Branden. Barbara Brandon's book also reported that Ms. Rand was often under the influence of some seriously strong amphetamines and I'm sure if she saw I had done the same thing , she'd have blasted me for not having the moral courage to go through life without artificial courage.I admire Ms. Rand for her works and her diligent fight against Communism (she is reeling in her grave at where our country stands now!), but it turned out to be do as I say, not as I do. I wasted a lot of years trying to be what she thought we should all aspire to. We can't. It's an impossibility. We are human, with human frailties which she and Nathaniel obviously both succumbed to. You just can't change Nature, which Ayn hated because she only loved that which was man-made. You can take some of this philosophy, but toss out what isn't right for you, otherwise you're a round peg in a very tight, painful square hole.I believe this movie was a hatchet job to discredit her as she  always stated:""The best way to destroy greatness is to celebrate the mediocre."" Or words to that affect.Just look at who eats up all the news 7 days a week: Paris Hilton, Britney Spears, Lindsey, Anna-Nicole, etc, ad nauseum!Atlas Shrugged is rumored to be in the works with Angelina Jolie, but don't hold your breath.",3,Hypocrisy On Rand's Part,1222646400,"09 29, 2008",2008,2837,"['was', 'student', 'Ayn', 'Rand', 'philosophy', 'patient', 'Mr.', 'Branden', 'several', 'decades', 'ago', 'early', '70', 'Why', 'was', 'trying', 'vain', 'live', 'Ms.', 'Rand', 'said', 'should', 'heroic', 'figures', 'day', 'perfect', 'morals', 'should', 'aspire', 'be', 'as', 'perfect', 'impossibly', 'perfect', 'cold', 'robotic', 'main', 'characters', 'novels', 'Fountainhead', 'Atlas', 'Shugged', 'only', 'book', 'hers', 'read', 'several', 'times', 'was', 'Living', 'characters', 'were', 'most', 'like', 'flesh', 'blood', 'real.While', 'was', 'going', 'Group', 'Mr.', 'Branden', 'house', 'had', 'idea', ""'d"", 'had', 'affair', 'Ayn', 'Rand', 'was', 'apparently', 'known', 'only', 'insiders', ""'d"", 'guess', 'Had', 'known', 'would', 'have', 'immediately', 'ended', 'relationship', 'was', 'was', 'totally', 'ineffectual', 'therapist', 'barely', 'able', 'stay', 'awake', 'spoke', 'comic', 'shrinks', 'movies', 'answer', 'own', 'questions', 'when', ""'re"", 'paying', 'HIM', 'Years', 'later', '15', 'free', 'minutes', 'Dr.', 'Laura', 'radio', 'fixed', 'problem', 'had', 'guilt', 'death', 'family', 'member', 'upside', 'did', 'know', 'Patrecia', 'who', 'was', 'changed', 'fictional', 'woman', 'movie', 'was', 'Goddess', 'men', 'loved', 'women', 'wanted', 'BE', 'was', 'essence', 'joy', 'life', 'died', 'way', 'too', 'young', '.slight', 'epilepsy', 'was', 'caused', 'strobing', 'sunlight', 'dancing', 'off', 'pool', 'had', 'seizure', 'fell', 'water', 'drowning.Now', 'see', 'high', 'moral', 'standards', 'underlings', 'were', 'supposed', 'uphold', 'were', 'completely', 'tossed', 'out', 'window', 'Ms.', 'Rand', 'Mr.', 'Branden', 'Barbara', 'Brandon', 'book', 'also', 'reported', 'Ms.', 'Rand', 'was', 'often', 'influence', 'seriously', 'strong', 'amphetamines', ""'m"", 'sure', 'saw', 'had', 'done', 'same', 'thing', ""'d"", 'have', 'blasted', 'not', 'having', 'moral', 'courage', 'go', 'life', 'artificial', 'courage.I', 'admire', 'Ms.', 'Rand', 'works', 'diligent', 'fight', 'Communism', 'reeling', 'grave', 'where', 'country', 'now', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'do', 'say', 'not', 'do', 'wasted', 'lot', 'years', 'trying', 'be', 'what', 'thought', 'should', 'aspire', 'ca', ""n't"", 'impossibility', 'are', 'human', 'human', 'frailties', 'Nathaniel', 'obviously', 'succumbed', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'change', 'Nature', 'Ayn', 'hated', 'only', 'loved', 'was', 'man-made', 'can', 'take', 'philosophy', 'out', 'what', ""n't"", 'right', 'otherwise', ""'re"", 'round', 'peg', 'very', 'tight', 'painful', 'square', 'hole.I', 'believe', 'movie', 'was', 'hatchet', 'job', 'discredit', 'always', 'stated', 'best', 'way', 'destroy', 'greatness', 'celebrate', 'mediocre', 'words', 'affect.Just', 'look', 'who', 'eats', 'up', 'news', '7', 'days', 'week', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'Britney', 'Spears', 'Lindsey', 'Anna-Nicole', 'etc', 'ad', 'nauseum', 'Atlas', 'Shrugged', 'rumored', 'be', 'works', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'breath']",N/A

King,"[3, 3]","If you are a true, die-hard, Ayn Rand fan, and are familiar with the details of her life, then you will find this perspective a bit hard to take in spots. Definitely a TV drama program...where all of the emphasis is on her personal love affairs, and not much on her as an author, or a prophetic genius of phylosophy. However, if you are willing to objective, and allow yourself to weed through the drama, there are little tid-bits of good film making...but mostly, it is a love story as has been told many, many times before...",3,Not for the Ayn Rand enthusiast,1207526400,"04 7, 2008",2008,527,"['are', 'true', 'die-hard', 'Ayn', 'Rand', 'fan', 'are', 'familiar', 'details', 'life', 'then', 'will', 'find', 'perspective', 'bit', 'hard', 'take', 'spots', 'Definitely', 'TV', 'drama', 'program', 'where', 'emphasis', 'personal', 'love', 'affairs', 'not', 'much', 'author', 'prophetic', 'genius', 'phylosophy', 'However', 'are', 'willing', 'objective', 'allow', 'weed', 'drama', 'are', 'little', 'tid-bits', 'good', 'film', 'making', 'mostly', 'love', 'story', 'been', 'told', 'many', 'many', 'times']",N/A
