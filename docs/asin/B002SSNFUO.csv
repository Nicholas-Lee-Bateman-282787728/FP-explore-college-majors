Everett (Brendan Bradley) meets Chase (Matthew Montgomery) while his partner of 7 years is away for a week.A fairy-tale romance and an explosive sex scene ensues; Everett is much more suited to be partnered by Chase than he is with his partner Miles who is over controlling, and the spark has obviously gone out of the relationship.I would love to say a lot about where all this ends, but you will have to see the film for yourself for that.

After seven years, their relationship has become so comfortable that Everett (Brendan Bradley) - while still devoted to his partner - is somewhat bored and misses the early, romantic days they spent together. When Miles takes Billy to his parents for a visit, Everett stays behind to work, but is soon interrupted by a stranger stopping to ask directions.  Chase (Matthew Montgomery) is a writer, who left his native Minnesota to get inspiration to finish his book, and check out the giant Redwood trees of Northern California, which have always fascinated him. Everett is likewise fascinated by Chase, and they start spending a lot of time together, eventually developing a sexual relationship.  Everett's family meets Chase, and are a bit concerned about the decisions Everett may face.  Before Miles and Billy are due back, so Everett takes one last walk with Chase, trying to decide where his true love lies.Screenwriter/Director David Lewis spins an interesting and highly emotional story, testing the power of love to its ultimate limits. Theoretically, the characters could have easily have been heterosexual rather than gay, but I personally feel the emotion is stronger with a gay couple, obviously not bound by any recognized legal commitment, at least on a federal level.  Ultimately, it is both a sad and comforting story, and I give it four stars out of five.

It is romantic, poignant, humorous, uplifting, sad, involving, and a totally thought-provoking, engrossing film that sucks you in from the first scene and does not let the viewer go until the surprisingly haunting ending!The main character, Everett, is in a long-term go-with-the-flow relationship with his husband Miles. The two of them are raising a young boy and their relationship seems to be in a rut. While Miles and Billy (their son) are away on a family trip, Through chance, Everett meets Chase, a writer who is lost (in more ways than one).Like the best of Charles Dickens' plot elements, coincidence plays a part in the two meeting not once, but twice and from there a poignant love story evolves and sweeps us, the viewer away.Everett, a very moral man, yet dissatisfied with where life is leading finally succumbs to his feelings that have been building for Chase throughout the film.Where he and Miles are a calm center of a storm, Everett (once he gives into his feelings) and Chase are a passionate hurricane! The film builds to a crescendo and leads to a surprising ending that I did not see coming (make sure you have a hankie ready). The acting and directing is awesome. I think this is now my favorite Matthew Montgomery film. He gets better and better with each movie!Each moment feels honest and true! If this movie is a low budget film, its honesty and serene setting certainly does not show! The small town setting in northern California is beautiful.. the redwood forests seems the perfect setting for such a wondrous love story.Needless to say, I cannot recommend this film highly enough.

Aside from some gorgeous landscape, the camera work is one dimensional without scope or imagination. The casting is odd. The lead, Brendan Bradley, looks 25 and amateurishly plays Everett a man in a seven year, troubled relationship. He and his husband are raising a special needs son who appears 9-12 years old. The script and direction has it unbelievable that these characters intimately know each other. In 10 mins we see the partner is shallow and bitchy then we embark on a paint by numbers, against the odds setup. Husband & son go on holiday leaving Everett home. A handsome gay drifter, Chase, (love the soapy names) played by Matthew Montgomery, gets lost in front of Everett's house. The script and acting had me suspecting that Chase was there purposely; nope, just bad dialogue and acting. The two have no chemistry but are smitten at first sight. Okay, we're fed an idea that Everett wants to resist Chase, but takes him around town & the Redwoods anyway, blah blah, have tourist snap photo, oh take a second photo (with a digital camera so that will be important later.) Blah-Blah, scenes of Everett thinking, blah, blah, Chase is a blocked writer on a journey of self discovery, Everett took writing classes so he's an authority. Chase allows Everett to read and critique the opus he's struggling with. Blah, Blah phoney 'author' dialogue, longing looks, sensual touches, almost kiss, kiss later, rip off clothes have passionate sex, blah, blah. Take secret lover to family dinner, adultery no problem. Ask ?naked? brother what he thinks of the new fella...adulterers - I mean lovers quarrel...make up...husband's coming home....time for stranger to go...must make a choice... I mean come on! Montgomery says his lines well enough but at the end we learn he was carrying a heavy burden which the romance does not fit into AT ALL.

1287421,A3BWP965RIWBCU,B002SSNFUO,"Gerald Parker ""Gerald Parker""","[1, 1]","This film is rather too long for its content, hence it come to drag along somnolently quite a bit. It is best to think of this as a kind of lyric statement on genuine gay male love. Its whole tone is, essentially, elegiac. Neither of the lead actors is particularly handsome. Both have nice enough physiques, which makes beholding them buck-naked a pleasant experience, but each of them in his own way lacks the grace that God gives to man with a face of an appeal commensurate with such fine corporeal assets. That said, Matthew Montgomery, as Chase, is rather sexy, in an off-beat, raw sort of way. The eye follows him with interest, and, frankly, Montgomery is a much better actor, too, than Brendan Bradley (as Everett), who is droopy and fey, making for, as it were, mass-baked ""white bread"" blandness (even for downright insipidity). If both men had been, physically, more closely equal in allure to the eye, as well as better matched dramatically, the film would have made a greater impact.There is an hyper-bourgeois, ""yuppie"" quality to all of this that, added to the pervading sentimentality, becomes pretty darn cloying way, way too often. At times I just felt a bit ""green at the gills"" from all this high-coloric emotional content. It was worth bearing with the film, however, in no small part due to all the gorgeous Pacific Northwest natural splendour that bathes this film in a halo of great outdoors beauty.

1287422,A3KLCX1XYL9821,B002SSNFUO,Glenn_from_CT,"[51, 53]","Whaddya know... a gay-themed movie where no one comes out, no one is in drag, no one gets beaten up and no one has AIDS.  For that alone, ""Redwoods"" deserves at least a star or two.The story centers around Everett (Brendan Bradley), a late-20s guy who has found himself in a very comfortable, but horribly static, life in small-town Northern California.  His seven-year partnership with Miles (Ted Coughenour) has eroded to that way-too-common place where love (or lack thereof) is expressed by which coupon to use at the store and who will scrub the mold in the shower.  The only life left in the relationship is in the form of their son, Billy (Caleb Dorfman), a special needs child who demands much of their attention.It's clear from the onset that Everett is miserable with the current state of affairs, but his love for Billy prevents him from actually doing or saying anything to the cold and neglectful Miles.  So, like many people, he shuts up, puts up and trundles along without rocking the boat.Miles and Billy leave for a week to visit Miles' parents in Seattle.  Right on cue, a handsome stranger appears on Everett's cul-de-sac, hopelessly lost and looking for directions... it's Chase (Matthew Montgomery), a writer from Minnesota who has come to redwood country to get inspiration for his latest novel.The sparks between Everett and Chase are immediate.  Soon, as this is a small town, the inevitable not-so-chance meeting occurs.  A friendship grows.  Everett becomes more and more conflicted about his feelings for Chase until it all finally uncorks into a fairly well done love scene.  Of course, this just makes matters worse for the love-starved Everett... does he abandon everything for true love or do the responsible thing and stick with his existing relationship?The idea of this film is a tremendous one... I mean, how many people out there have this kind of mid-life crisis, where they question everything they have?  And with a better writer (director David Lewis also scripted) ""Redwoods"" could have been a helluva film.Unfortunately, Lewis doesn't give us much of screenplay and gets too caught up in the romance of this romance.  He expects us to immediately buy into the Chase/Everett affair and not question anything else.  And there are a lot of questions here... where did Billy come from exactly?  Why is Miles so unaffectionate?  If this is such a small town - where everyone knows everyone's business - why would Everett parade Chase around for all to see?  Why would he introduce Chase to his family, for heavens sake?  How could such a monumental, life-altering, oh-my-god relationship gain full-bloom status in the matter of just a few days?  And are either of these guys aware that there's a whole lotta cheatin' going on?Sure, we can draw our own conclusions, but it would have made for a better film if the characters did it for us.  Annoyingly, the script also never really allows anyone to open up and say what's on their mind.  Instead we get lots of pauses, lots of drawn-out, ponderous one-line statements, and a lot of nothing being said.Most of the casting (and subsequent acting) doesn't help.  First, Bradley is way too young to play someone in a seven-year relationship and with a ten-year-old kid.  Second, he doesn't have the acting chops needed to carry the film.  He's likeable - with his cherub face and goofy smile - but most of his deliveries suffer from massive over-elocution, and most of the acting choices he makes are way too deliberate.Likewise, none of the supporting characters seems to make any sense in this story, and none do anything to really drive things forward.  Note to all gay film writers out there: Please, please, PLEASE ditch the straight brother or best friend who uses the word ""dude.""  Please.The exception here is Montgomery, who is quickly becoming the Meryl Streep of gay indie romances.  He knows how to turn in a thoughtful performance and does so here, eking out richness and depth from a script that provides almost nothing for him to work with.  Look out for the day that this guy gets a solid script and co-star who can really act.All this isn't to say that ""Redwoods"" doesn't have its finer points.  Although the analogy between the redwood trees and the theme of the film is insanely weak, the nature footage is lush and beautiful.  And if romance is really your thing - and you're the kind of person that doesn't mind chucking reality aside to get your romantic fix - then this film is definitely for you... `cuz kids, this is some serious sweetness devoted to celluloid here.  Realists: Run away.Me, I'm halfway between the two camps.  That said, there was one beautifully realized moment in the film that really won me over: while Chase is hanging out with Everett, Miles calls.  Everett takes the call and begins chatting, wandering behind the sofa where the patient Chase sits.  Absently, Everett puts his hand on Chase's shoulder... a first sign of affection between the two.  Everett rubs Chase's shoulder lightly, completely unaware that he's doing it.  Why?  Because it's the kind of thing he's probably done with his partner of seven years a million times over.  This one tiny moment speaks more than any other scene in the movie, showing how comfortable Everett has become with Chase and how absently the two have fallen for each other.  Now, if the rest of ""Redwoods"" was as well-conceptualized, it would have been worthy of a bunch more stars.",3,"Like a fine Swiss cheese... flavorful, but full of holes.",1263513600,"01 15,

1287432,A18KZNIH8MGGKJ,B002SSNFUO,Kartik,"[0, 0]","The theme explored in this film - the relationship that could have been - is nothing new, but here it is set against a beautiful backdrop of Northern California scenery.Everett has been with his partner Miles for seven years, and they have a son, Billy, together.  The passion has long gone of out of their relationship and Miles is an unappreciative, nagging type.  The glue that holds whatever is left of their relationship is their love for their son, who has an intellectual disability.  When Miles and Billy go to Seattle to visit Miles' parents, Everett looks forward to some quiet time by himself. Of course, at just the right time, a handsome young stranger, Chase, appears at Everett's house asking for directions.  The film explores the attraction between them and the way their relationship develops over the next few days. Given his commitment to his partner and love for his son, can Everett give up his secure life to be with Chase?Overall this is an enjoyable film to watch, but I agree with other reviewers that some performances, particularly Brendan Bradley's (Everett's), are disappointing.  The film is really only 'saved' by Matthew Montgomery, who is excellent in the role of Chase and upstages Everett as the focal character of the film.  There is also a certain lack of believability about the film. For example although Chase and Everett are both good-looking, their personalities and priorities in life are so different from each other that I wondered why they should be so strongly attracted to each other. It just didn't seem right.

The theme, to me, seemed so much like a gay version of the ""Bridges of Madison County"" - in a battle between established order and love, the former usually wins having stood the test of time. Even if it means that one remains in a lifeless, passionless existence. To first watch Brendan Bradley's character, Everett, in such a state of pained loneliness even though he is already in an established partnership with another man was, to me, torturous and pointless. Why the hell stay in a dead-end relationship? To then progressively watch him develop a passionate love affair with visiting writer, Chase, played by hunky Matthew Montgomery, was akin to watching with bated breath the liberation of East Germany and the fall of the Berlin Wall. But to then watch him loose his marbles and choose his dead (albeit, established) relationship over the tender, loving Chase really took the cake - it was akin to watching an act of masochistic self-flagellation!At the end of the movie, I had to ask myself : is this what it's all about? Do we spend the largest portion of our lives searching for happiness and then, when we finally find it, we just simply throw it in the dumpster? What kind of message does that give the youth of the LGBT community? That we deserve to live painful, lonely lives because of the circumstances in which we find ourselves and that ""true"" love is about beating yourself up and bearing it all with a stoic face?A promising ending like the one in Alan Brown's ""Private Romeo"" would have been preferred. In Private Romeo, the star-crossed male lovers did not end up dead or wasted. The message was clear : there is hope for us. We do not have to end up in the dumpster because of what we are or whom we love.But for the superb cinematography, Redwoods, to me, would have been in the dumpster.",3,A bleak tale saved by superb cinematography.,1346284800,"08 30, 2012",2012,2069,"['cinematography', 'was', 'most', 'compelling', 'feature', 'motion', 'picture', 'magnificent', 'ancient', 'forest', 'scapes', 'as', 'far', 'eye', 'can', 'see', 'allowing', 'one', 'float', 'illusion', 'timelessness.The', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'something', 'else', 'altogether', 'theme', 'seemed', 'so', 'much', 'gay', 'version', 'Bridges', 'Madison', 'County', 'battle', 'established', 'order', 'love', 'former', 'usually', 'having', 'stood', 'test', 'time', 'Even', 'one', 'lifeless', 'passionless', 'existence', 'first', 'watch', 'Brendan', 'Bradley', 'character', 'Everett', 'such', 'state', 'pained', 'loneliness', 'even', 'already', 'established', 'partnership', 'man', 'was', 'torturous', 'pointless', 'Why', 'hell', 'stay', 'dead-end', 'relationship', 'then', 'progressively', 'watch', 'develop', 'passionate', 'love', 'affair', 'visiting', 'writer', 'Chase', 'played', 'hunky', 'Matthew', 'Montgomery', 'was', 'akin', 'watching', 'bated', 'breath', 'liberation', 'East', 'Germany', 'fall', 'Berlin', 'Wall', 'then', 'watch', 'loose', 'marbles', 'choose', 'dead', 'established', 'relationship', 'tender', 'loving', 'Chase', 'really', 'took', 'cake', 'was', 'akin', 'watching', 'act', 'masochistic', 'self-flagellation', 'end', 'movie', 'had', 'ask', 'what', 'Do', 'spend', 'largest', 'portion', 'lives', 'searching', 'happiness', 'then', 'when', 'finally', 'find', 'just', 'simply', 'throw', 'dumpster', 'What', 'kind', 'message', 'give', 'youth', 'LGBT', 'community', 'deserve', 'live', 'painful', 'lonely', 'circumstances', 'find', 'true', 'love', 'beating', 'bearing', 'stoic', 'face', 'promising', 'ending', 'one', 'Alan', 'Brown', 'Private', 'Romeo', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'preferred', 'Private', 'Romeo', 'star-crossed', 'male', 'lovers', 'did', 'not', 'end', 'up', 'dead', 'wasted', 'message', 'was', 'clear', 'hope', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'end', 'up', 'dumpster', 'what', 'are', 'whom', 'love.But', 'superb', 'cinematography', 'Redwoods', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'dumpster']",N/A

At one stage the male leads are deeply in love and the next they are at each other's throats.
