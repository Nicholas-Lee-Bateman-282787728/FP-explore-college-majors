It just didn't match David's other movies. If you're just looking for a few laughs to kill time, this might work for you. I don't have enough time to kill any of it.

1299027,A1ZSWL641H5018,B002Y38T9A,"Marie44 ""marie44""","[3, 5]","This movie was disappointing and annoying. I really like many of the films these actors have been in previously and had high hopes for this one simply based on the participants. What a letdown. Considering it is advertised as a comedy, it wasn't funny. I laughed once early in the film about the joke of a fiddler who once went to Woodstock and never really returned, and didn't laugh the entire rest of the movie. I watched it on the GMC channel, which often broadcasts terrific faith-based programming, so I don't know if I actually saw the entire movie since they often cut movies short for commercial time, but what I saw was not at all the same good quality of the other movies these actors have been in. This is not a movie for young children since the characters behave so immaturely and without the Christian morals that are usually prevalent in films with these actors. There are also unnecessary and partisan snide remarks about CNN and President Carter that seem to have no reason other than to make political statements which don't fit in the film. It is not until the last 10 -15 minutes of the movie that the main actor ( David A.R. White), an Amish man who has been corrupted by money and immoral living, gets an epiphany (while in a hot dog costume) and turns his life around. His girlfriend (played by the main actor's real-life wife, Andrea Logan White, who was so good in ""Sarah's Choice"", ""In the Blink of an Eye"", and the Moment After movies) has a violent knock down/knockout fight with a woman who made moves on her boyfriend. Only during the last moments of the movie does the lesson of nothing in the world in worth losing your soul get communicated. There are so many other movies these actors have been in, from the early Christiano Brothers films like ""Second Glance"" (which was MUCH more funny than this film) and ""End of the Harvest"", ""The Crossing"", ""Mercy Streets"" (which also has a great soundtrack), to ""Hidden Secrets"" (a terrific movie!) and more. I have bought and shared many of the movies these actors have been in and have shared them with others. All I can say about this movie is it was a waste of time to see it and I hope they go back to making the other kinds of films again. There are many actors in this film that are in the other videos, some of which I've listed, and I highly recommend those films over this one.",1,I wish I could recommend it,1290902400,"11 28, 2010",2010,2362,"['movie', 'was', 'disappointing', 'annoying', 'really', 'many', 'films', 'actors', 'have', 'been', 'previously', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'one', 'simply', 'based', 'participants', 'What', 'letdown', 'Considering', 'advertised', 'comedy', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny', 'laughed', 'once', 'early', 'film', 'joke', 'fiddler', 'who', 'once', 'went', 'Woodstock', 'never', 'really', 'returned', 'did', ""n't"", 'entire', 'rest', 'movie', 'watched', 'GMC', 'channel', 'often', 'terrific', 'faith-based', 'programming', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'actually', 'saw', 'entire', 'movie', 'often', 'cut', 'movies', 'short', 'commercial', 'time', 'what', 'saw', 'was', 'not', 'same', 'good', 'quality', 'other', 'movies', 'actors', 'have', 'been', 'not', 'movie', 'young', 'children', 'characters', 'behave', 'so', 'immaturely', 'Christian', 'morals', 'are', 'usually', 'prevalent', 'films', 'actors', 'are', 'also', 'unnecessary', 'partisan', 'snide', 'remarks', 'CNN', 'President', 'Carter', 'seem', 'have', 'reason', 'other', 'make', 'political', 'statements', 'do', ""n't"", 'fit', 'film', 'not', 'last', '10', '-15', 'minutes', 'movie', 'main', 'actor', 'David', 'A.R', 'White', 'Amish', 'man', 'who', 'been', 'corrupted', 'money', 'immoral', 'living', 'epiphany', 'hot', 'dog', 'costume', 'life', 'around', 'girlfriend', 'played', 'main', 'actor', 'real-life', 'wife', 'Andrea', 'Logan', 'White', 'who', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'Sarah', 'Choice', 'Blink', 'Eye', 'Moment', 'movies', 'violent', 'knock', 'down/knockout', 'fight', 'woman', 'who', 'made', 'moves', 'boyfriend', 'Only', 'last', 'moments', 'movie', 'lesson', 'nothing', 'world', 'worth', 'losing', 'soul', 'get', 'communicated', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'movies', 'actors', 'have', 'been', 'early', 'Christiano', 'Brothers', 'films', 'Second', 'Glance', 'was', 'MUCH', 'more', 'funny', 'film', 'End', 'Harvest', 'Crossing', 'Mercy', 'Streets', 'also', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'Hidden', 'Secrets', 'terrific', 'movie', 'more', 'have', 'bought', 'shared', 'many', 'movies', 'actors', 'have', 'been', 'have', 'shared', 'others', 'can', 'say', 'movie', 'was', 'waste', 'time', 'see', 'hope', 'go', 'back', 'making', 'other', 'kinds', 'films', 'again', 'are', 'many', 'actors', 'film', 'are', 'other', 'videos', ""'ve"", 'listed', 'highly', 'recommend', 'films', 'one']",Holyman Undercover
