E Jackson,"[1, 1]","I don't know whether Shiloh Falls should fall under the category of sci-fi or just plain horror but whatever the case, it's certainly NOT a western!Oh sure, the first 10 minutes of film definitely TRICK you into thinking it's a typical western with cowboys riding horses and pulling guns on each other, but after that one brief scene... this storyline changes *drastically*.It's about an evil man who wanders around in an old ghost town of some sorts (don't know if it's actually considered a ghost town) and he actually STEALS peoples souls!  Yes, I too was quite surprised when this part of the storytelling entered the picture.It's definitely a cheesy idea for a storyline, especially when you're tricked into thinking it's a western and something else entirely.Anyway, a few cowboys (along with a few teens) have to do everything in their power to completely avoid coming into contact with this evil man (along with the rest of the townspeople) so their souls aren't taken.  BOY was it hard writing a sentence like that without laughing a little bit, but I somehow managed to do it!Anyway, despite having to put up with some incredibly cheesy dialogue for the majority of the suspenseful parts (like the segments where the cowboys have to stay hidden inside a cabin of sorts, completely away from danger) I thought Shiloh Falls  did a decent job building up an atmosphere.  Granted, it's a *tiny* atmosphere.  Nothing we haven't seen before (and better) in other sci-fi and horror films.Oh and... oops!  There was one scene where the cowboys were supposed to be completely hidden and away from danger, but um... they were literally standing just a few feet away from the evil townspeople and apparently went completely unnoticed by every single one of them.  That was one strange moment.Overall, no, this is definitely NOT a classic, haha.  There's many flaws with this film, and most of them are immediately noticeable.  It feels even cheesier than most, and at times even feels like a homemade horror storyline with low budget camera work and production and whatnot.Still, you could definitely do worse than this.  At least it kept my interest for the majority of it, and the acting is good enough to give the writers some credit.Oh, and the special effects were really neat as well, but it could very well be that I just like them because seeing glowing orbs and whatnot in a dark cowboy setting looks pretty darn cool.",4,good sci-fi fun,1276214400,"06 11, 2010",2010,2426,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Shiloh', 'Falls', 'should', 'fall', 'category', 'sci-fi', 'just', 'plain', 'horror', 'case', 'certainly', 'NOT', 'western', 'Oh', 'sure', 'first', '10', 'minutes', 'film', 'definitely', 'TRICK', 'thinking', 'typical', 'western', 'cowboys', 'riding', 'horses', 'pulling', 'guns', 'other', 'one', 'brief', 'scene', 'storyline', '*drastically*.It', 'evil', 'man', 'who', 'around', 'old', 'ghost', 'town', 'sorts', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'actually', 'considered', 'ghost', 'town', 'actually', 'STEALS', 'peoples', 'souls', 'Yes', 'too', 'was', 'quite', 'surprised', 'when', 'part', 'storytelling', 'entered', 'picture.It', 'definitely', 'cheesy', 'idea', 'storyline', 'especially', 'when', ""'re"", 'tricked', 'thinking', 'western', 'something', 'else', 'entirely.Anyway', 'few', 'cowboys', 'few', 'teens', 'have', 'do', 'everything', 'power', 'completely', 'avoid', 'coming', 'contact', 'evil', 'man', 'rest', 'townspeople', 'souls', 'are', ""n't"", 'taken', 'BOY', 'was', 'hard', 'writing', 'sentence', 'laughing', 'little', 'bit', 'somehow', 'managed', 'do', 'Anyway', 'having', 'put', 'up', 'incredibly', 'cheesy', 'dialogue', 'majority', 'suspenseful', 'parts', 'segments', 'where', 'cowboys', 'have', 'stay', 'hidden', 'cabin', 'sorts', 'completely', 'away', 'danger', 'thought', 'Shiloh', 'Falls', 'did', 'decent', 'job', 'building', 'up', 'atmosphere', 'Granted', '*tiny*', 'atmosphere', 'Nothing', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'better', 'other', 'sci-fi', 'horror', 'films.Oh', 'oops', 'was', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'cowboys', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'completely', 'hidden', 'away', 'danger', 'um', 'were', 'literally', 'standing', 'just', 'few', 'feet', 'away', 'evil', 'townspeople', 'apparently', 'went', 'completely', 'unnoticed', 'single', 'one', 'was', 'one', 'strange', 'moment.Overall', 'definitely', 'NOT', 'classic', 'haha', 'many', 'flaws', 'film', 'most', 'are', 'immediately', 'noticeable', 'feels', 'even', 'cheesier', 'most', 'times', 'even', 'feels', 'homemade', 'horror', 'storyline', 'low', 'budget', 'camera', 'work', 'production', 'whatnot.Still', 'could', 'definitely', 'do', 'worse', 'least', 'kept', 'interest', 'majority', 'acting', 'good', 'enough', 'give', 'writers', 'credit.Oh', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'really', 'neat', 'well', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'just', 'seeing', 'glowing', 'orbs', 'whatnot', 'dark', 'cowboy', 'setting', 'looks', 'pretty', 'darn', 'cool']",Shiloh Falls
1111192,A2KWQ64TRHB3YH,B000WPE8RO,Israel Drazin,"[1, 1]","This film is a western drama with science fiction and horror elements. In 1872 two criminals rob a stagecoach, kill a stage coach driver, and force another driver to open a mysterious crate. When the box is opened, we see a pendant that emits a strange light. The light envelopes the stage coach driver who suddenly becomes stronger. He attacks one of the criminals and kills him. Twenty years later, the other criminal escapes from jail with two confederates. He is determined to kill the stagecoach driver who killed his brother.  The three escapees are pursued by a sheriff and his son, who is his deputy. The son stumbles on a grave site of the brother and stage coach driver and notices that they were killed on the day he was born.The sheriff and his son find the outlaws in a strange town, Shilo Falls, where all the people look and act strangely. One of the escapees shoots a citizen who does not die. They soon discover that the citizens of the town ""have no spirit...they don't eat or drink...and he keeps them alive."" The ""he,"" they soon see, is the man who opened the box and killed the brother of the escaped convict. He is controlling the town citizens who act like zombies.Will the sheriff and his son be able to overcome the man with the unusual power from the light? What is the light? What exactly is the power? Is there significance in the fact that the sheriff's son was born on the very day that the light was revealed? Will the two lawmen have to join forces with the escaped convicts to overcome the mysterious man? What will happen to them and the town people?

Calling this a ""western"" would be like calling ""The Martian Chronicles"" a ""western"".  Bradubry would not approve.If you go in expecting ""Western"", you will come out disappointed - or perhaps bewildered.But, if you go in thinking ""What if they made 'Hotel California' into a movie?""  ...You'll be quite satisfied.I really do not understand all the bad reviews.  I thought the acting was pretty good, really.  More realistic than the typical blockbuster, superhero, uber-star, ""I wanna be the next Eastwood"" hollywood nonsense.The characters, the costumes, the sets were all really good.  And the town of Shilo Falls, when you first come into it, really catches the spirit of ""creepiness"" at it's core.  Watching that was about the closest thing I could imagine to actually seeing a ghost walking around in broad daylight.  You could feel the tension as though you were there.So, overall, I was quite happy with it.
