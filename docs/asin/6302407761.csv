It is beautifully acted by all the principal players, has some fine photography and at its core is the theme of the stultifying atmosphere of a Roman Catholic school for boys destined for the priesthood.  But the hormone-laden youngsters fight a losing battle, and while some manage to suppress and progress down the path of righteousness, others fail and sin.  It is a wonderful film thoroughly worth watching, unless you are looking for sexual titillation in which case you will be disappointed, as the subject is treated tastefully with subtlety and finesse.",5,Life-affirming,1247529600,"07 14, 2009",2009,631,"['can', 'see', 'why', 'film', 'won', 'so', 'many', 'awards', 'when', 'came', 'out', '1976', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'principal', 'players', 'fine', 'photography', 'core', 'theme', 'stultifying', 'atmosphere', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'school', 'boys', 'destined', 'priesthood', 'hormone-laden', 'youngsters', 'fight', 'losing', 'battle', 'manage', 'suppress', 'progress', 'down', 'path', 'righteousness', 'others', 'fail', 'sin', 'wonderful', 'film', 'thoroughly', 'worth', 'watching', 'are', 'looking', 'sexual', 'titillation', 'case', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'subject', 'treated', 'tastefully', 'subtlety', 'finesse']",N/A

Phelps,"[1, 2]","In the U.S. Armed Forces, as an officer, I have traveled in several foreign countries, developed a cosmopolitan regard for different cultures.  Also, it was my privilege to brief subordinates on cultural differences so that such behaviors did not compromise military regulations that required their conformance with no exceptions.  From an Australian's point of view in regards to the sitz im leben fo that nation, for Roman Catholics especially, it is no surprise to see this DVD identified as &#34;Australia's Most Honored Film&#34; in 1976 - and into the present.  Many families both religious and humanist have no option but to send their sons and daughters to Boarding Schools, due to the Australian Outback and location of schools.  For a young boy ca. ages 11-13 who is coming of age, viz. puberty, away from home, in a single sex boarding school, the film depicts the emotional-sexual challenges any boy must come to terms over.Indeed, it is a Devil's Playground not restricted by age.  In a very constructive manner, the challenges to Roman Catholic Priests to sustain their vows of celibacy are portrayed.  Teenage suicide is a fact of life, and the single incident portrayed in this DVD film isvery constructive to gain the attention of Adult and Minor.  The Director had the courage to apply his personal experiences to some very controversial subjects to alert any Parent, Guardian, Authority Figure - and youth also - to be aware of the tension betweenrepressed desires and doctrines.  This DVD is useful to others who are not from the Roman Catholic community to consider how to address in a positive manner &#34;coming of age&#34; matters - and what can happen if negative methods usurp meaningful, compassionate understanding.",5,Devil's Playground,1380844800,"10 4, 2013",2013,1743,"['U.S.', 'Armed', 'Forces', 'officer', 'have', 'traveled', 'several', 'foreign', 'countries', 'developed', 'cosmopolitan', 'regard', 'different', 'cultures', 'Also', 'was', 'privilege', 'brief', 'subordinates', 'cultural', 'differences', 'so', 'such', 'behaviors', 'did', 'not', 'compromise', 'military', 'regulations', 'required', 'conformance', 'exceptions', 'Australian', 'point', 'view', 'regards', 'sitz', 'im', 'leben', 'fo', 'nation', 'Roman', 'Catholics', 'especially', 'surprise', 'see', 'DVD', 'identified', '34', 'Australia', 'Most', 'Honored', 'Film', '34', '1976', 'present', 'Many', 'families', 'religious', 'humanist', 'have', 'option', 'send', 'sons', 'daughters', 'Boarding', 'Schools', 'due', 'Australian', 'Outback', 'location', 'schools', 'young', 'boy', 'ca', 'ages', '11-13', 'who', 'coming', 'age', 'viz', 'puberty', 'away', 'home', 'single', 'sex', 'boarding', 'school', 'film', 'emotional-sexual', 'challenges', 'boy', 'must', 'come', 'terms', 'Devil', 'Playground', 'not', 'restricted', 'age', 'very', 'constructive', 'manner', 'challenges', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'sustain', 'vows', 'celibacy', 'are', 'portrayed', 'Teenage', 'suicide', 'fact', 'life', 'single', 'incident', 'portrayed', 'DVD', 'film', 'isvery', 'constructive', 'gain', 'attention', 'Adult', 'Minor', 'Director', 'had', 'courage', 'apply', 'personal', 'experiences', 'very', 'controversial', 'subjects', 'alert', 'Parent', 'Guardian', 'Authority', 'Figure', 'youth', 'also', 'be', 'aware', 'tension', 'betweenrepressed', 'desires', 'doctrines', 'DVD', 'useful', 'others', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'community', 'consider', 'how', 'address', 'positive', 'manner', '34', 'coming', 'age', '34', 'matters', 'what', 'can', 'happen', 'negative', 'methods', 'usurp', 'meaningful', 'compassionate', 'understanding']",N/A

Constantly reminded of the sinful nature of the flesh, the boys are at the same time  trying to cope with the changes  in their bodies brought on by puberty.  The brothers, at least some of them, are troubled by the feelings of being cut off from the normal lives of those on the outside, and struggle to cope with the myriad rules that govern their lives.  The story is told through the eyes of a 13-year old boy who feels he has the calling to become a brother, but is beset by doubts as he sees the hypocrisy and cruelty around him.The entire cast is fine, especially Simon Burke as the boy, and Arthur Dignam as the rigid brother obsessed with purifying the body and the mind, yet is himself troubled by dreams of a sexual nature.Now, I'm one who enjoys non-American films precisely because they often unfold at a leisurely pace, but I found this one a little rambling at times.

310568,ARZY2Z2OLRF2U,6302407761,"William ""William""","[36, 40]","The charming child actor Simon Burke does a remarkable job connecting with his audience in this film. The film is about adolescent sex play and developing boys during puberty while confined to an all boys boarding school. The school is opressive but the boys use creative way's to survive this and try to love their developing bodies as best they can. Tom Allen (Simon Burke) has a charm about his smile that will get you in the heart and he knows how to act as well. The film is very well made and does accurately portray life in boys boarding schools. The Australian version of boys boarding schools seems to be much more opressive than the Brithish version of the same type of environment, of course this is from an American public school reviewer who has read a lot about these things. Note that this film is not a dark portrayal of life nor is it exploitive of boys sexuality. The boy's seem to have a ruggedness about their sexual curiosity that withstands the abuse of the system in the school. Also note that this film does not portray any sexual activity between the staff and the boys, but the staff sure has a botched up attitude about their own bodies.
