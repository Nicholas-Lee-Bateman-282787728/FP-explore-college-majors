This Thomas DVD is actually animated rather than its usual its usual live action and models show. Aidan really got a kick out of it because it was different than the other Thomas DVDs we have. Splish Splash Splosh also features a new host, Driver Perkins, who can only be seen on this DVD so it was nice to see a new train character. Throughout the DVD, there is lots of excitement, great morals, and wet fun! Overall, this DVD is definitely our new favorite Thomas adventure mostly because of the awesome animation. It is 46 minutes of Thomas fun and was just released earlier this month. Great DVD for new or old Thomas fans, but once you watch the animated Thomas DVDs, the old ones may seem a little boring.",5,"Fun, Animated Thomas fun!",1263513600,"01 15, 2010",2010,829,"['sons', 'love', 'DVD', 'First', 'full', 'screen', 'CGI', 'Animation', '3D', 'computer', 'graphics', 'Thomas', 'DVD', 'actually', 'animated', 'rather', 'usual', 'usual', 'live', 'action', 'models', 'show', 'Aidan', 'really', 'got', 'kick', 'was', 'different', 'other', 'Thomas', 'DVDs', 'have', 'Splish', 'Splash', 'Splosh', 'also', 'new', 'host', 'Driver', 'Perkins', 'who', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'seen', 'DVD', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'new', 'train', 'character', 'DVD', 'lots', 'excitement', 'great', 'morals', 'wet', 'fun', 'Overall', 'DVD', 'definitely', 'new', 'favorite', 'Thomas', 'adventure', 'mostly', 'awesome', 'animation', '46', 'minutes', 'Thomas', 'fun', 'was', 'just', 'released', 'earlier', 'month', 'Great', 'DVD', 'new', 'old', 'Thomas', 'fans', 'once', 'watch', 'animated', 'Thomas', 'DVDs', 'old', 'ones', 'may', 'seem', 'little', 'boring']",N/A

Thomas learns how to splash in mud puddles.  (You're kids will know now as well.  Mine did, and sploshed the wife, who was not too happy...)This DVD is CGI, with live-action interludes.  You will watch an episode, then cut back to Knapford Station with Mr Perkins, then head out on another journey.Personally, I liked Mr Arkwright better than Perkins.  Arkwright had more energy and emotion.  Perkins, well, just seemed to be earning a check really.Oh, and hope you like opera.
