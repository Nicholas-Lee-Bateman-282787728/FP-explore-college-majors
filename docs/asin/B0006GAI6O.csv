I found his role very entertaining & at the same time you relate to it. JLO is as beautiful as ever, although I expected more of her. If I start talking about Suzan Sarandon I will never stop. Although her role could have been done by any actress, they will never give the role the grace that she adds to anything she does.I really loved the movie (I watched twice in 24 hours!!), my favorite bit is the Waltz in the competition.

866816,A3TNM3C9ENUCFW,B0006GAI6O,"A.M.Boughey ""Poetmaster""","[3, 3]","Richard Gere and Susan Sarandon play outwardly happy couple in this remake of the little known 1996 Japanese movie of the same title. Gere is stuck in a humdrum job, but is more than comfortable with a family, wife who works for Saks Fifth Avenue, two children, and house in the suburbs. Never wanting to appear ungrateful or unhappy with all he has, he is ""Mr Popular"" at work, but inwardly missing something in his life. During his commute home he notices Jennifer Lopez at the window of a broken down dance school each evening, until curiosity gets the better of him and he stops by to investigate. What outwardly appears at this point as a standard infidelity flick, turns into a gentle comedy as Gere enrolls in the school and finds friendship and fun with his new dance class opposites, and starts to come alive. His wife soon begins to notice his late nights and odd behaviour, as do his kids and hires a private detective to find out if he is cheating, and the story is cleverly laced with many of the elements that anyone in a long term relationship will recognise. This is a lot of fun to watch, and although maybe not intellectually stimulating, it isn't overly sentimental or sugary either. A great support cast, most notably from Stanley Tucci as Gere's quiet work colleague who is secretly a wild latin ballroom dance exponent, and a wide collection of quirky characters add fun and balance to the picture. Predictable? well yes and no, there are a few surprises along the way, some great comedy, a little depth of emotion, and overall a good balance. This is wholesome family viewing with a capital W, and the direction and script though tight are a little too far on the right side of the PC line to be quite believable, but that's my only real complaint. Gere is great, and refreshingly mature in this role, Lopez a visual distraction, and Sarandon nicely grounded as the doubting wife. Not quite 4 stars, but a great couples movie (probably older couples that is).

866817,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0006GAI6O,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 8]","Where to begin, where to begin.  First of all, this is not a Jennifer Lopez vehicle for any of you who think this is going to be another `Maid in Manhattan' or something of the sort.  Jennifer's role is very small indeed and she hardly shines here.  Jennifer Lopez is far from a great actress and she appears in far from great movies, but she has always been able to bring enough charm to her roles that her movies become enjoyable in their simplicity.  Movies like `Maid in Manhattan' and `The Wedding Planner' are delightful despite their lack of real flare.  Here though, with the film out of her hands so-to-speak she has no real chance of salvaging the wreckage, and what few scenes she does inhabit show no signs of her even trying.The film follows John Clark, a middle aged business man who is apparently unhappy with his perfect life and so he decides to change things up by secretly attending ballroom dancing classes at a local studio.  He soon finds that his business partner Link is also a secret dancer who hides his passion behind fake enthusiasm for sports like football.  John's wife Beverly suspects John is having an affair with him working late and in better moods and so she hires a private detective to investigate only to uncover that her husband is dancing and is going to enter a competition.The problem for me with `Shall We Dance' is that it is ultimately a pointless film with no real redeemable factors, aside from Stanley Tucci's hilarious if not over the top performance (I'm sorry but the whole wig thing had me in stitches).  To me the whole midlife crisis thing was just a ploy to try and make this slush legit, which it doesn't.  The performances are less than average really.  Richard Gere is far from charming and his character is quite the bore.  Susan Sarandon, a goddess on the screen, is wasted here.  I'm still baffled she agreed to do this film.  Lopez, as I said, is horrible here.  Lisa Ann Walter is funny to a degree as the obnoxious Bobbie, but even her antics coupled with Tucci aren't enough to make even one viewing of this film worthwhile.  It's not very often I find a film so utterly wasted, but this is one that I wish I had never wasted my time to witness and one I surely will never watch again.",1,"Void of all charm, an utterly pointless film...",1191801600,"10 8, 2007",2007,2251,"['Where', 'begin', 'where', 'begin', 'First', 'all', 'not', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'vehicle', 'who', 'think', 'going', 'be', 'Maid', 'Manhattan', 'something', 'sort', 'Jennifer', 'role', 'very', 'small', 'indeed', 'hardly', 'here', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'far', 'great', 'actress', 'far', 'great', 'movies', 'always', 'been', 'able', 'bring', 'enough', 'charm', 'roles', 'movies', 'become', 'enjoyable', 'simplicity', 'Movies', 'Maid', 'Manhattan', 'Wedding', 'Planner', 'are', 'delightful', 'lack', 'real', 'flare', 'Here', 'film', 'hands', 'so-to-speak', 'real', 'chance', 'salvaging', 'wreckage', 'what', 'few', 'scenes', 'inhabit', 'show', 'signs', 'even', 'trying.The', 'film', 'John', 'Clark', 'middle', 'aged', 'business', 'man', 'who', 'apparently', 'unhappy', 'perfect', 'life', 'so', 'change', 'things', 'up', 'secretly', 'attending', 'ballroom', 'dancing', 'classes', 'local', 'studio', 'soon', 'business', 'partner', 'Link', 'also', 'secret', 'dancer', 'who', 'passion', 'fake', 'enthusiasm', 'sports', 'football', 'John', 'wife', 'Beverly', 'John', 'having', 'affair', 'working', 'late', 'better', 'moods', 'so', 'private', 'detective', 'investigate', 'only', 'uncover', 'husband', 'dancing', 'going', 'enter', 'competition.The', 'problem', 'Shall', 'Dance', 'ultimately', 'pointless', 'film', 'real', 'redeemable', 'factors', 'aside', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'hilarious', 'not', 'top', 'performance', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'whole', 'wig', 'thing', 'had', 'stitches', 'whole', 'midlife', 'crisis', 'thing', 'was', 'just', 'ploy', 'try', 'make', 'slush', 'legit', ""n't"", 'performances', 'are', 'less', 'average', 'really', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'far', 'charming', 'character', 'quite', 'bore', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'goddess', 'screen', 'wasted', 'here', ""'m"", 'still', 'baffled', 'agreed', 'do', 'film', 'Lopez', 'said', 'horrible', 'here', 'Lisa', 'Ann', 'Walter', 'funny', 'degree', 'obnoxious', 'Bobbie', 'even', 'antics', 'coupled', 'Tucci', 'are', ""n't"", 'enough', 'make', 'even', 'one', 'viewing', 'film', 'worthwhile', 'not', 'very', 'often', 'find', 'film', 'so', 'utterly', 'wasted', 'one', 'wish', 'had', 'never', 'wasted', 'time', 'witness', 'one', 'surely', 'will', 'never', 'watch', 'again']",N/A
866818,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B0006GAI6O,Andy Orrock,"[6, 10]","We rushed to see the sneak preview of the 'Shall We Dance' re-make because the original (Japan, 1997) is one of my favorite movies.  And while this is a nice enough re-make (essentially re-done shot-by-shot), it fails to come close to recreating the one special force that drove the original: that lead Koji Yakusho's (Richard Gere's role here) flirtation with dance flies directly into the face of every societal more in Japan, most notably the 'salaryman' death-by-overwork culture and idea that the 'upright nail gets hammered down.'Yakusho has a palpable battle with demons throughout the film and has every logical right to keep his new passion a well-cloistered secret.  In contrast, the best the screenwriters can do for Gere's John Clark is that he appears to be mildly depressed (undiagnosed) and at a loss to how to articulate that fact.  Still, he's depicted as being in a loving, open relationship with his wife (nicely played by Susan Sarandon), and there's nothing in US society on the equivalent to Japan that would compel Gere's character to have to keep dance classes a buried secret.  As Sarandon says, ""if you wanted to dance, why didn't you ask me?""  And, indeed, I think it really is that simple.Beyond those concerns, there are two standout roles worthy of note here:- Stanley Tucci is fabulous as Link Peterson and an alter-ego that no explanation here can do justice- Jennifer Lopez, in a role she was born to play.  There's no camera trickery here.  That's her on the dance floor.  And kudos to her and/or her advisors for seeing professional ballet dancer Mai Kishikawa's turn in the original and realizing how well Lopez could embody the look and spirit of a lonely dancer staring out a window.",3,"Nice little movie, but...",1096848000,"10 4, 2004",2004,1721,"['rushed', 'see', 'sneak', 'preview', ""'Shall"", 'Dance', 're-make', 'original', 'Japan', '1997', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'nice', 'enough', 're-make', 'essentially', 're-done', 'shot-by-shot', 'come', 'close', 'recreating', 'one', 'special', 'force', 'drove', 'original', 'lead', 'Koji', 'Yakusho', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'role', 'here', 'flirtation', 'dance', 'flies', 'directly', 'face', 'societal', 'more', 'Japan', 'most', 'notably', ""'salaryman"", 'death-by-overwork', 'culture', 'idea', ""'upright"", 'nail', 'hammered', 'down', 'palpable', 'battle', 'demons', 'film', 'logical', 'right', 'keep', 'new', 'passion', 'well-cloistered', 'secret', 'contrast', 'best', 'screenwriters', 'can', 'do', 'Gere', 'John', 'Clark', 'be', 'mildly', 'depressed', 'undiagnosed', 'loss', 'how', 'articulate', 'fact', 'Still', 'depicted', 'being', 'loving', 'open', 'relationship', 'wife', 'nicely', 'played', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'nothing', 'US', 'society', 'equivalent', 'Japan', 'would', 'compel', 'Gere', 'character', 'have', 'keep', 'dance', 'buried', 'secret', 'Sarandon', 'wanted', 'dance', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'ask', 'indeed', 'think', 'really', 'simple.Beyond', 'concerns', 'are', 'two', 'roles', 'worthy', 'note', 'here', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'fabulous', 'Link', 'Peterson', 'alter-ego', 'explanation', 'here', 'can', 'do', 'justice-', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'role', 'was', 'born', 'play', 'camera', 'trickery', 'here', 'dance', 'floor', 'kudos', 'and/or', 'advisors', 'seeing', 'professional', 'ballet', 'dancer', 'Mai', 'Kishikawa', 'turn', 'original', 'realizing', 'how', 'well', 'Lopez', 'could', 'embody', 'look', 'spirit', 'lonely', 'dancer', 'staring', 'out', 'window']",N/A

866822,A36YGQN7LQZKQU,B0006GAI6O,Banjo Benny,"[24, 34]","The Japanese version of this movie falls into the comedic category of a ""Manners Comedy."" In a Manners Comedy, the characters are so super-concerned with what other people will think about them that they do crazy things to avoid being ""found out."" This is set up beautifully in the opening narrative of the original, where the narrator makes the statements about Japanese culture and reserve, how couples will not show affection in public, and that to be caught actually enbracing a stranger in public would be ""beyond embarassing.""The script of the original has a beautiful balance of characters who are ""safe"" and characters who are ""dangerous."" The charming older lady teacher is ""safe"" and the lead character naturally gravitates to her. The overweight and unfiltered ""fat lady dancer"" character is ""dangerous"" and leads, at all points in the movie, to embarrassment. Yet in the end, she too is a supportive friend and there is a wonderful mutual acceptance among ALL the characters. This is part of the charm of the movie - the notion that in the end, dancing promotes civilized, harmonious interaction. The characters are ALL exposed in the end, and that creates a caring and a bond between them.The original is a very sweet, beautiful little movie.Now to this movie:1. Richard Gere should never have been cast. It is simply  impossible to accept him as a man who feel overwhelmingly trapped in his mundane life.2. Jennifer Lopez should never have been cast. She doesn't have the substance required for the role. For one thing, she is a terrible dancer. For another, she lacks the polish of someone who has been trained to compete at the world level in such a ""sophisticated"" endeavor. The role requires someone like Audrey Hepburn or Ingrid Bergman. Instead we get ""barfly""3. All the fundamental conflicts and goals that drive the plot  in the movie are missing in this version. In the original movie, the main character's melancholy was brought on by a recent home purchase. There is a vitally important scene in the original movie that was left out of the remake. In the original, the Stanley Tucci character has a conversation with the Richard Gere character in which he praises the latter for being ""a big success - you're moving up."" In response, the Richarad Gere character says ""I had to mortgage my life to the firm to pay for it."" This is a fantastically critical line because it tells the audience, as early as possible, what the main character's conflict is - he feels TRAPPED. He worked all his life to buy this house and now that he has it, it feels like a ball and chain. In the same scene, the Stanley Tucci character is ridiculed by his co-workers. He too feels trapped in a life that is not right for him, too. Yet because of Japanese reserve and manners and traditions, both feel guilty - they must ""do their duty"" and live their lives as others tell them life should be lived.In America, the fundamental conflict that drives the whole movie really doesn't translate very well, does it? In America we all can already do pretty much anything we want. To translate the plot to Chicago would require subtlety and intelligence. This director is apparently devoid of either.In the Japanese version, the wife character is TOTALLY dependent on her husband. This is important. In the American version, the wife character seems completely independent. If she loses Richard Gere, it's not life or death - she gets a very healthy alimony and immediately moves on to someone else. In Japan, divorced women cannot so easily remarry. The stakes for the wife are much higher in that movie. And since it is a Manners Comedy, she is too embarrassed to confront her husband directly. Instead, she hires a private detective. This makes no sense in the American version.4. A fundamental question of the original movie is, ""is the relationship between the lead and the dancer adulterous?"" What drives the Richard Gere character to the J-Lo character? How can we forgive him for doing it?In the original, we know the lead character is TRAPPED. (""mortgaged his life to the firm""). He explains to the  Stanley Tucci character that he got married and had a child  almost before he knew what he was doing. He feels he SHOULD be happy - he has accomplished all of his goals - yet something  is missing. And he doesn't know what it is.When he sees the beautiful young woman looking out the window,  he doesn't just say to himself ""hubba hubba! what a dish"" and  resolve to bed her. Instead, he is drawn to her because she  appears to be ""trapped"" too. She is like a beautiful bird in  a cage, looking out at the world. She wants to fly away. He  can sense this. He wonders why - she is so beautiful, how can  she not be happy? Why is she like me? Why is it that we both  have everything society tells us we need to be happy, yet we  are not happy?In the original, you can get the gist of this because of the  way the plot is set-up, and because of the excellent use of  the camera, and because of the natural grace, dignity, charm  and elegance of the actress. In this remake, it is completely  absent. You just see this curvy bimbo looking out the window from a distance.In the remake, there is no way for the audience to appreciate the lead character's feelings of relationship, and connection. So when he pursues her, it doesn't really make any sense.I could go on and on about why this movie is vastly inferior to the original. Instead, let me just say that I could only bear watching this monstrosity for about twenty minutes. It is so hideous and unintelligent compared to the original, it is REMARKABLE!  How could this director ever have been given the money to butcher the movie in this way? He obviously didn't have the slightest understanding of the original, how it was put together and what made it work.It is an example of Hollywood at its worst. Stupid people with lots of money who have no ability to analyze plots. Instead they just sign a couple of big stars and hope for the best.Hanging would be too good.",1,Director and Producer should be shot,1116028800,"05 14, 2005",2005,6022,"['Japanese', 'version',

Not a great movie by any means, it does manage to entertain throughout.John Clark (Richard Gere) is a fairly successful estate lawyer who seems to be finding himself a little bored with his life. He has a good career, a loving wife (Susan Sarandon), 2 children, and a beautiful home, but something seems to be missing. On his way home from work each night on the subway, he passes Miss Mitzi's dance school. Intrigued by the beautiful women who he often sees standing in the window (Jennifer Lopez), he decides on impulse one day to give it a shot, and take a look inside.From there on, he decides to enroll in ballroom dancing, which he comes to find as quite refreshing and therapeutic to his ""mundane"" life. The rest of the film has to do with Gere learning to appreciate dance, and not being embarrassed by it. He keeps this secret from his wife and kids, and develops a whole new set of relationships with his dancing teacher Miss Mitzi (Gillette), instructor Paulina (Lopez), and other fellow students.This was a good supporting role for Lopez, and she shines here much more than in her other starring roles from previous years. As Paulina, she plays an ex competitive ballroom dancer turned instructor who has become a little jaded with life, with men, and with dance.It all leads up to a amateur dance contest, with Gere and his other fellow classmates taking part. He's coached mainly by Miss Mitzi (Anita Gillette), with a little help from Lopez. There is a great dance sequence between Gere and Lopez that I found to be the highlight of the film. Both dance exceptionally in this movie, with Lopez doing some really fine work.In the end, Gere learns to be open about his love of dance with his wife & kids, his co-workers and even with himself.There are not too many adult films like ""Shall We Dance"" being released by the studios these days, so in that sense, the film is a little refreshing. At times far-fetched, ""Shall We Dance"" is still an enjoyable ""one time watcher"".Recommended for more mature adults, I do not feel that this is really a movie to be enjoyed by everyone.

He is bored with his average existence and wants some excitement. He eyes a young lass and seems to be thinking about having an affair. The woman is an instructor at a dance school and Gere's character enrolls. He quickly discovers how much he likes dancing and in the end, his mind fades from a guy thinking about cheating to a man who realizes that he actually has things very good with his own family and relationships.Richard Gere's crisis in the film is something that many men in this age group can probably relate to. Gere is very genuine in this movie. He means no harm to anyone, even though his wife starts to get suspicious about his disappearances each evening. He is just a man who is tired of the same old routine every day. He craves excitement, and he finds it when he signs up for the dance class.Besides Gere, I also liked the performance by Stanley Tucci. He plays Gere's dual- natured friend who has been living a life of disguise. He is really good at dancing, but he wears a wig when he attends dances so that no one will recognize him. I liked the way Tucci was able to pull this off. He was equally convincing as both a serious businessman and a guy who enjoys letting loose on the dance floor.This movie is serious at times, funny at others, and romantic at its core. Some good one- liners pop up throughout, but the movie is more serious than anything else. I found it entertaining overall, and I recommend giving it a viewing if you get the chance.

Hollywood failed to deliver anything decent, despite the well made original movie they started with. This original story is tasteful, timeless and offers characters we can identify with.This plastic, Hollywood version of the same film showcases yet another uninspiring, typical Hollywood mysogyny mess filled with little more than the usual unmatched market-centered mediocrity.The Hollywood lead is the usual 'star' stud.  He pretends to be a middle aged, professionally advantaged, well-monied power monger who is bored with his life of excess and ease.  He decides to amuse himself and begins his clandestine diversions behind his wife's back.  He ventures into the ghetto, away from his peers and associates.  Here he enjoys slumming on the sly, in hot persuit of his target: a trashy, morally bankrupt, trampy, immature, barely legal dance teacher.  Their lines and interactions are vitriolicly vile in thier predictable, prepackaged, perverse platitudes.This original Japanese story gives far better.  Here is a man who is struggling to find meaning in a life filled with an emptiness he can't quite grasp. This original story isn't wonderlust, this is a shared sense of loss, futility, and disappointment that we can connect with.Hollywood plot changes aside, the casting choices were wrong.  Lopez gives the role a crass cheapness that crudely removes the ramining hints of class, elegance or distinction from the already disfigured indignity by Hollywood upon the original storyline.Here is a fine example of a beautiful story gone to hell in the hands of Hollywood.Hollywood doesn't make too many 'movies', mostly are little more than glorified infomercials, airbrushed extensions of playboy, and mindless marketing campaigns with idiotic dialog full of auditory advertisements and strict adherance to the ""sex sells"" standard.  I'd rather not support human objectification and sexual degradation in any form (no matter how subtle).My advice: Watch the Japanese original version of the film and forget about this remade wreck.Shall We Dance?

Remakes are always risky, especially when the original flick is as beloved as Masayuki Suo's enchanting ""Shall We Dance?"" But even taken by itself, the American version of ""Shall We Dance?"" is a limp exercise in romantic comedy, that steps on its own toes over and over.John Clark (Richard Gere) has it all -- a successful career, a lovely and loving wife (Susan Sarandon), and a good home. So, of course, he's not satisfied and has a weird midlife crisis -- on the way home, he sees a woman (Jennifer Lopez looking sadly out her window at a dancing studio. He decides that his life has no meaning without a depressed pretty woman, and signs up for dancing lessons.Unfortunately, he ends up with older Miss Mitzi (Anita Gillette), not window-gazing Paulina. For some inexplicable reason (it's the 21st century! Can't men dance if they want?), Clark keeps his dance lessons a secret from his wife, and she starts suspecting he's having an affair. So she hires a private detective to shadow him, as Clark's dances with Paulina get hotter.The basis of ""Shall We Dance?"" was ballroom dancing, and its awkward place in Japanese culture. But it doesn't make ANY sense when you shift it to Chicago -- the American culture is so different that the social commentary is simply tossed out the window. Instead, we get J.Lo, which is apparently supposed to cover the gaping plot holes. Guess what -- it doesn't work.Usually a remake strays from the original plot, but unfortunately this clings close to the original. Scripting and camerawork are full of words and shots that echo too loudly of the original. Not out of respect for Masayuki Suo, but apparently out of artistic laziness -- it's like a xerox of a classic manuscript.What does Peter Chelsom give this movie. Here's what he gives it: Vulgar bright colours, and silly subplots involving Tucci's disguises and Bobby Cannavale as a closeted macho man. Too much time is spent on the moronic side characters, apparently so we don't notice the plot's lack of logic.Richard Gere does a passable job as a bored businessman, but he's somewhat overshadowed by the subtle, strong performance by Susan Sarandon, and a fun turn by Stanley Tucci. Jennifer Lopez proves again that she is Hollywood's most inept actress. She's supposed to convey heartbreak, yearning and depth, and only manages a sort of blank sullenness. She dances well, but that's all.""Shall We Dance?"" takes a small, charming Japanese sleeper hit and remakes it as a big, brassy all-star movie with the grace of a dancing mammoth.

866854,A2SRZQU1SZG4RR,B0006GAI6O,"Erika Borsos ""pepper flower""","[5, 5]","Richard Gere plays Mr. John Clark, a contracts lawyer who commutes to and from work on the ""El"" (elevated train) in Chicago. Daydreaming and thinking about the day's events, he looks out the window. as he passes a red brick building with huge letters on the side, ""Miss Mitzi's Dance Studio"". He views Paulina, played by Jennifer Lopez, a beautiful dance instructor who is wistfully gazing out the window. He is captivated. When he sees her dancing, he is enticed to take ballroom dance lessons to help him break out of his humdrum predicatble existence. He lives in the suburbs, has two teenaged children, a girl and boy and a lovely wife of 19 years named Bev (Susan Sarandon) who is a successful department director in a high-end clothing store. He keeps his passion for dancing to himself ... until he discovers a co-worker at his office also has this secret passion.Stanley Tucci plays a lawyer who is fascinated by sports, which he talks about at the office all the time but it is a ruse. His real passion is for dancing, which has been an interest since he was a teenager. Tucci is hilarious as he dons a wig over his otherwise bald head, during his macho dance routines. John Clark discovers his ""secret"" at a hot dance spot where his friend melts the dance floor and is the center of attention. Bev, John's wife, is getting suspicious why John keeps coming home late on Wednesday nights (dance lesson night). Her curiosity is further fueled by a coworker's concerns that her own husband is having an affair. One Wednesday night, Bev calls the office only to discover John had left for the day. She questions him about his activities and he explains he left the office but then had returned to finish his work (this explanation does not wash as he did not pick up the line when she called). Bev takes matters one step further and hires a private investigator to track her husband's moves, fearing an affair. Obviously, communication between them is at an all time low. They live parallel lives, sharing very little about their personal thoughts and feelings ...Matters heat up between Paulina the dance instructor and John Clark after Miss Mitzi enrolls John and several other new students in a ballroom dance contest. John receives some one on one dance lessons with Paulina. The ballroom dance contest became the climactic experience for all the dancers. Miss Mitzi's students shone. Then an unexpected event changed the good fortune of John and his partner Bobbie. Bev and her daughter had secretly attended the performance and witnessed the circumstances. In the end, ball room dancing became the stimulus which helped revive the marriage of John Clark and his wife Bev. Ballroom dancing helped the other novice dancers discover courage in themselves and provided a successful foundation on which to build further succcess in life. Paulina also developed renewed confidence to pursue her career goals despite a setback which had initially led her back to teach dance lessons at Miss Mitzi's ...Overall, the film was an overwhelming success in terms of how it tied together the disparate lives of some very different people who had only one thing in common, an interest in ball room dancing. The film is a huge success because of how it so beautifully conveys ball room dancing to be the stimulus which reawakens Mr. John Clark to come alive, break out of his mold, reconnect with himself, his wife and his life. It is done with creativity and complexity. The plot and story development was superbly done. The tensions which arise in his life and are resolved keep the attention of the viewer throughout the film. There are hilarious moments, too such as when John Clark discovers his coworker dancing like a macho super star with all the beautiful women ... such a contrast to his typical office persona. The fact that John Clark originally became interested in ball room dancing because of seeing Paulina, the beautiful dance instructor staring out the window ... provides more counterpoint of temptation, emphasizing the humdrum relationship with his wife. The film builds interest and fascination as the relationship between John Clark who is the student and Paulina, the exquisite dance instructor develops. The big question is ... will they or won't they connect into something more?Peter Chilsom the director did a phenomenal job of matching the right actors and actresses for the various roles. The DVD special features section was especially well done , the interview with the Director, and various actors and actresses provided wonderful insights into how the film was made and the challenges of learning ballroom dance. I deduct one star for only this reason, the film needed some long shots of scenes in Chicago. The scenes were confined to either views along the way as Mr. Clark rode the train, the inside of the dance studio, the inside of the Clark's home, Mr. Clark's office, some dark dreary street scenes, a restaurant, or the ballroom. The film begins with Mr. John Clark on the ""El"" and one sees very little of the city at any time during the film. Chicago has uniquely attractive buildings for which it is famous and a stunningly beautiful water front, honing in on some of these during the film, perhaps as it began or ended would have enhanced the film enormously.

When I finally saw the movie (my mom who's seen both films highly recommended the American version to me), I was surprised how much I enjoyed it.The cultural contrast of the Japanese film ceased to exist in the 2004 movie but there is still a lot to like in it. First of all, I love to watch good dancing and ""Shall We Dance?"" has plenty of it. Gere's and Lopez's dancing together has grace and passion, and it was a wonderful moment in the film.Then, there are memorable and funny supporting characters that had screen time enough to become more than the lifeless shadows - Stanley Tucci (Link) and Lisa Ann Walter (Bobbie) for whom the ballroom dancing is the road to freedom, and happiness.And the last but not the least, the movie is asking the question, how to make a man happy if he's got everything - the job he enjoys, the family he loves, his health, and good looks but something is missing?

He and his fellow students are clumsy and sadly pathetic, but as they progress, a change comes over them.

866862,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0006GAI6O,Grady Harp,"[9, 10]","Remakes of successful movies run tremendous risks of comparisons, of rattling the cages of 'purists', of losing the original intent for the sake of making the remake look 'new'.  Director Peter Chelsom appears to have all the right ingredients and the right motivation to transcribe the delightfully thoughtful Japanese original film into an American statement: he maintains the core idea of loneliness in the business of living in a big city (here, Chicago), the desire for 'something more' in the life of a successful, supposed-to-be-happy businessman (here, John Clark, a good probate lawyer who ties up people's lives and asks 'well, is there anything else?') in a good marriage to a good woman more concerned with her own career and the intricacies of raising their teenagers than communicating tenderness to her husband, a forlorn dancer-turned-teacher in private pain from a lost love affair, and various people trying to find some surrogate for happiness and subjugate that urge by settling on a diversion of Ballroom Dancing.  For this film Chelsom has gathered some superb actors:  Richard Gere as John Clark understands the inner disquiet he feels as his commuter train passes by the window of Miss Mitzi's Dance Class where stands Paulina (Jennifer Lopez) gazing into the emptiness that her world has become.  Susan Sarandon completely inhabits her role as John's wife, so convinced that all is right with her marriage that when fellow workers discuss marital infidelity she engages the help of a detective and his able assistant (Richard Jenkins and Nick Cannon) to see if she is a possible victim.  John follows an impulse and begins dance lessons at Miss Mitzi's (Mitzi is portrayed by the very talented and underused Anita Gillette) along with two other men (Bobby Cannavale of 'The Station Agent' and Omar Benson Miller) both of whom have private reasons for wanting to learn the frivolity of ballroom dancing. Also involved in the dance class are Bobbie (in a powerful cameo by Lisa Ann Walter) and Stanley Tucci (a co-worker in John's firm who is dancing in macho secret).So why with all of this intact does this film not content itself to be an adult drama about 21st century isolation and loneliness and the need for belonging?  For this viewer (who incidentally liked the film very much) the addition of slapstick (wigs for Tucci, homophobic comments ad infinitum, overplayed talent show antics, etc) lowers the beauty of an otherwise very tender story.  Gere and Lopez dance beautifully and have a special relationship much like the original, but the two have so little screen time together that this important potential transition suffers: the magic goes wanting.

Of course he never tells anyone including his wife.  He discovers one of his office mates Ballroom Dances and it becomes their secret.The initial reason he takes up Ballroom Dancing is because he is bored with his life, his job, his wife, his kids.  HE sees a hot chick and is intrigued.His wife thinks something funny is up and ends up tracking him down to a Dance contest where she surprises him with daughter in tow.In the end of the movie he dances with her and tells her he doesn't want to dance with anyone else... boo hoo violins in the background.Had the hot Ballroom Instructor (Jennifer Lopez) given him a chance, he would have nailed her like a highschool kid in heat!But alas, your chick will think it's romantic because he ends up dancing with his wife at the end of the movie.It's like at the end of Pretty Woman where the Hooker rides off into the sunset with the Rich good looking dude. Pure Fantasy!  And how is a Rick good looking dude hooking up with a Hooker romantic in the first place?As with Pretty Woman, this one is bearable and you won't want to kill yourself afterwards.If you play your cards right, you could dance your way into your ladies heart...Chicks...

866864,A18MBO1U4DPY20,B0006GAI6O,Harkanwar Anand,"[2, 3]","""Shall We Dance"" is alarming with how calm a film it is.It starts off in a manner unknown to me.Using directional synchronisation,it somehow collides with the monotonity of a certain month in a middle aged man's life that isn't going too well. He travels from work to home via a train. He notices Jennifer Lopez standing on the balcony of a dance school. The next day, he notices the same and this time he notices she's looking to the darkness within and  beyond  (Yeah I've read Ayn Rand)Like most curious men would do but be discreet about it, he decides to check up on it.He joins the school and thus begins some fun.There is strange comedy in the eyes and facial expressions of Richard Gere. I laughed a lot in the first 45 minutes. The best scene in the film was also the only swearing used in the film at all. I won't spoil this movie for you and I'm sorry if my comprehension makes it any less interesting.I'm usually very strict on movies with fairy tale endings but I'll let this one be because it is done with an extremely laid back screenplay. I don't think it would make any difference to my movie experience if I deleted the last 300 seconds or so.Anyhow,there's a certain dialogue in the film by Susan S. which describes marriage. Look out for that.I would not recommend this movie to everyone though because a few have the power to observe. Also a slight flaw lies in how quickly Richard Gere gets results on everything he does. He gets a letter from Paulina and more. It seems a bit too movie like for me to swallow.

866867,ASOJUBRHQI1DW,B0006GAI6O,IRA Ross,"[6, 10]","People who have given poor reviews to ""Shall We Dance?"" seem not to have gotten the point of the film:  ""Shall We Dance?"" is primarily a romantic fantasy and on that level it works like a dream.  Do not come to the film expecting a serious true-to-life docudrama of the dance world; that notion should be dropped immediately. Never mind the supposedly illogical premise that Richard Gere's bored, dissatisfied businessman cannot tell his wife and his daughter that he is taking ballroom dancing lessons.  In this macho world of ours it is considered an absolute no-no for men to take dance lessons.  Stanley Tucci's hillarious turn as Gere's co-worker, a lover of Latin dancing, also takes lessons on the sly, and proves that real men do the tango.  Jennifer Lopez is fine (and you can quote me) as the sad, wistful dance instructor who inspires Gere to take lessons in the first place.  The supporting characters are funny and loveable, including the ascebic, charmingly obnoxious waitress who is Gere's partner in the dance competition.  I could not help but connect with the secret yearnings of each and every one of them.  Anita Gillette as the slightly dipsomaniacal owner of Miss Mitzi's Dance School is the heart and soul of the film as she is at the school.  The dance numbers at the competition are great and the clips of Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse from ""The Band Wagon"" dancing up a storm are a beautiful homage to what ""Shall We Dance?"" is all about.

Yet I feel compelled to analyze why this film doesn't work as well as the original.First, the era.  I somehow feel that the U.S. version would have worked better if set in the 1950's, since Japanese society seems to bear certain similarities to that era, with its inhibitions.  The Japanese woman was a homemaker - and therefore her husband's possible infidelities would be a threat as well to her way of life.  The independent career woman played by Sarandon is in a much different position.Second, the actors.  Gere and Lopez are just too recognizable, yet not the kind of great actors (like Ben Kingsley or Meryl Streep) who can just melt into their roles.  I'm all too aware that this is Gere and Lopez that I'm watching, not their characters.Third, the milieu.  Why change the ordinary middle class salaryman of the original into an upper middle class attorney?  Somehow, it's easier to sympathize with the ordinary accountant who feels that he will be stuck the rest of his life in his boring accounting job in order to support his family and pay his mortgage than it is to sympathize with Gere's more wealthy character.Fourth, I agree with other reviewers that this film lacks that subtlety of the original.So maybe I would have liked this better if I hadn't seen the original.

866877,A1PNNR3B9H8GTC,B0006GAI6O,Jeremy Berman,"[10, 12]","No celebrity this year has been more adversely affected by media overexposure than Jennifer Lopez. Her tempestuous breakup with Ben Affleck followed by her whirlwind marriage to Marc Anthony made her a permanent fixture on magazine covers and entertainment programs for months, and the public has grown tired of her unending series of hang-ups and heartbreaks. To win back her fans, Lopez has chosen to star in an adaptation of the 1996 Japanese romantic comedy classic Shall We Dance?, giving the actress ample opportunities to showcase her vulnerability and shake her internationally acclaimed groove-thing. Although her efforts to return to the A-list may be hopeless, it should be noted that her latest movie, while far from perfect, is a reasonably charming, consistently enjoyable little chick flick that will do her image no further injury.Lopez plays the role of Paulina, a frustrated dancer who takes a job teaching at a Chicago dance school after a humiliating failure in a dance competition and a subsequent breakup with her partner/boyfriend. Her plaintive yet beautiful appearance catches the attention of harried lawyer John Clark (Richard Gere), who sees her in the window of the school every night on his way home from work. Clark is slowly being stifled by his dull job and predictable marriage to cosmetics hotshot Beverly (Susan Sarandon), and impulsively decides to join the dance school to learn more about the mysterious woman. In typical Hollywood fashion, he meets a lot of wacky classmates and daffy instructors, reignites the passion in his life through ballroom dancing, and ultimately helps Paulina reconnect to her art.If this sounds like a rather scant plot for a movie that is almost two hours long, it is. Director Peter Chelsom and screenwriter Audrey Wells try to fill the time by crafting many redundant scenes where Gere performs awkwardly on the dance floor or Lopez stares resentfully at someone, and the results are sometimes sleep-inducing. They also introduce several subplots to keep the narrative flowing, with varying degrees of success. I greatly enjoyed the exploits of Link Peterson (Stanley Tucci), a colleague of Clark's who displays a macho faade at the office while secretly pursuing a sizzling dance career through the school. Link's efforts to conceal his identity on the dance floor through the use of a frightful wig are consistently hilarious, and his fear of being branded a (...)because of his love of dancing offers poignant commentary on the confining nature of gender stereotypes.Another storyline involving an abrasive dancer (Lisa Ann Walter) who must collaborate with Peterson and Clark to triumph in a local dance contest is also interesting and well-paced, while the dance-off itself is one of the best filmed and best choreographed sequences in the movie. Conversely, the sections of the film where Beverly (unaware that her husband is taking dance lessons) hires a detective to investigate John's frequent disappearances are ridiculous and frustrating because there is no logical reason for John to conceal such prosaic information from his wife and no cause to believe that an assertive businesswoman like Beverly would be too mousy to simply ask her husband about his whereabouts.For all its flaws, Shall We Dance? usually manages to get by on the enormous charisma of its cast. Gere manages to overcome his good looks to create an endearing and sympathetic portrait of a loser, and his game attempts at dancing are every bit as infectious as they were in Chicago. Omar Benson Miller and Bobby Cannavale win laugh after laugh as two inept dance pupils seeking to impress the women in their lives, but usually fail to steal scenes that have already been conquered by the delightfully over-the-top antics of Tucci and Walter. And although she is criminally underused, Sarandon is heartbreakingly realistic as the distraught wife (her deeply moving monologue on the reasons why people get married is worth the price of admission alone). The weakest link in this almost-perfect chain is J-Lo, who simply lacks the dramatic depth to make her character's frustration and sorrow seem like more than a protracted hissy-fit. However, since her only plot function is to lure Gere into the dance school and help him train for the dance-off (leaving her absent from more than half of the movie), she can win over the audience on the strength of her sexy costumes and fine dancing skills.I consider myself a firm opponent of predictable, clich&eacute;d romantic comedies, but Shall We Dance is graceful, enthusiastic and well-acted enough to transcend this genre for significant portions of its running time. It will absolutely enthrall romantic damsels who can weep for Gere and Sarandon and cheer J-Lo's ultimate redemption. Everyone else will enjoy a pleasant evening at the movie's that will neither rival memories of the classic source material nor induce nausea. When the box-office competition includes movies about talking sea creatures and horny firefighters, one could probably do worse.",4,A Pleasant Romp,1096934400,"10 5, 2004",2004,5054,"['celebrity',

Perhaps she remembers too well our 1999 classes in ballroom dancing preparatory to the gala New Year's Eve formal affair we attended to end the millennium, in all of which I demonstrated that This White Man Can't Dance.Richard Gere plays lawyer John Clark, a writer of wills, who's undergoing a mid-life crisis. Certainly, he loves his wife Beverly (Susan Sarandon) and his teenage daughter Jenna (Tamara Hope), but his daiy routine is otherwise one of quiet desperation. Then, riding home on the elevated train, he notices Miss Mitzi's Dance Studio alongside the tracks. Even more intriguing is the solitary Latin beauty standing motionless in an open window. One evening, on a mad impulse, he alights from his ride and signs up for beginner's lessons in ballroom dancing. Miss Mitzi (Anita Gillette) provides the practical knowledge of the dance steps, but it's her assistant Paulina (Jennifer Lopez), the Latin beauty from the window, who can imbue the school's students with passion, as when she describes how to dance the rumba:""The rumba is the vertical expression of a horizontal wish. You have to hold her, like the skin on her thigh is your reason for living. Let her go, like your heart's being ripped from your chest. Throw her back, like you're going to have your way with her right here on the dance floor. And then finish, like she's ruined you for life.""Beverly, who knows nothing of her husband's new interest, begins to suspect he's having an affair. She hires a private detective (Richard Jenkins) to uncover the dirt. In perhaps the film's best monologue, Beverly explains to the gumshoe why people get married, which is that each individual, otherwise a non-entity in a world of billions, needs someone to bear witness to his/her life. It's perhaps one of the most poignant justifications of marriage that I've ever run across.SHALL WE DANCE? includes several fine performances: Stanley Tucci as Clark's colleague Link, whose closet dedication to ballroom dancing is a secret life unknown to his co-workers, and Lisa Ann Walter as Bonnie, the earthy and abrasive blonde on the downslope of middle-age determined to win a local dance competition, in which, of course, John's involvement figures significantly in the evolution of the plot. Somewhat disappointing to me was J Lo's Paulina, who came off more prickly than was perhaps necessary. Indeed, it wasn't until Paulina's description of the rumba (quoted above) that I saw any good reason for her character's presence in the film.SHALL WE DANCE? is undeniably a chick flick, but, to my and my wife's amazement, I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Richard Gere is John, an estate attorney vaguely disatisfied with his rather dull, albeit lucrative job and suburban domesticity. Shohei Sugiyama is Koji, a man trapped in a life he hates. Gere's voiceovers show a man who needs a bit more fun and excitement in his life. Sugiyama's body language and facial expressions show a man in despair, unable to escape his repressive culture and the consequences of his own decisions. Gere learns to dance to have more fun in his life. Sugiyama learns to dance to liberate his soul. And Sugiyama is a far more talented actor than Gere. Not only are his motivations to learn to dance far more profound but his relationship with the female leads is much more complex. For instance, when Gere first sees Jennifer Lopez in the window from his train he seems to be thinking ""Hey, that's a nice-looking woman"". When Sugiyama first sees Mai Kishikawa you can see the electricity pass between them. He sees another tormented soul and is immediately drawn to her.This brings me to the next point of casting, the main female lead. Jennifer Lopez is a reasonably talented actress and is attractive enough but brings nothing to the role that any attractive, talented actress couldn't have brought. She is clearly an actress who learned to dance for a role, rather than a dancer first. Mai Kishikawa is much more authentic as Tamiyo. She has the look and the grace of a natural dancer, which Lopez simply lacks. I never believed Lopez's Paulina could be a world-class competitive dancer while Tamiyo is wholly believable. Also, Paulina comes across as a woman getting over a long-time relationship that ended badly while Tamiyo is a woman devastated at the apparent destruction of a life-long dream. In the Japanese version both principal leads are motivated by an emptiness in their soul while in the American version they are just bored and a little lonely. Totally different.The third character, the wife, also shows the difference in the two films. In the Japanese version, she is a lonely, repressed housewife forced to hire detectives because she feels unable to confront her cold, distant husband over his strange behavior. Her emotionally repressive culture simply won't allow her to deal with him directly. Susan Sarandon's wife, on the other hand, is a gregarious, highly succesful executive. Her befuddlement at her husband's abscenses simply made no sense. Why not just ask him rather than spend thousand of dollars on investigators? I didn't buy her behavior at all.This brings me to the whole cultural context of the film. Shall We Dansu portrayed Japan as an emotionally repressed place where husbands are unable to publically (and even privately) show affection for their wives and where learning to dance is considered unmanly. Koji's secrecy makes sense here. This simply isn't true of contemporary America. My wife, an immigrant and a very astute observer of culture, asked me as soon as the movie was over ""Why didn't Richard Gere just take his wife out dancing?"". I had no good answer. The difference is even clearer in the character of the coworker who secretly loves Latin dancing. In the Japanese version he wears a wig both to hide his own identity and to take on a wholly new one. In the American version the wig just becomes a ridiculous prop. Why was he so ashamed to let his coworkers know he danced? The scene where they made fun of him didn't ring true at all.Shall We Dansu, then, had a far more talented cast and was a much more interesting investigation of culture than Shall We Dance. I challenge you not to feel joy in your heart after watching it. Save your money and skip this disappointing remake.",2,Get the far superior Japanese original instead,1113609600,"04 16, 2005",2005,3844,"['just', 'saw', 'American', 'version', 'Shall', 'Dance', 'last', 'night', 'unfortunately', 'was', 'inferior', 'Japanese', 'original', 'Shall', 'Dansu', 'way', 'First', 'casting', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'John', 'estate', 'attorney', 'vaguely', 'disatisfied', 'rather', 'dull', 'lucrative', 'job', 'suburban', 'domesticity', 'Shohei', 'Sugiyama', 'Koji', 'man', 'trapped', 'life', 'Gere', 'voiceovers', 'show', 'man', 'who', 'bit', 'more', 'fun', 'excitement', 'life', 'Sugiyama', 'body', 'language', 'facial', 'expressions', 'show', 'man', 'despair', 'unable', 'escape', 'repressive', 'culture', 'consequences', 'own', 'decisions', 'Gere', 'dance', 'have', 'more', 'fun', 'life', 'Sugiyama', 'dance', 'liberate', 'soul', 'Sugiyama', 'far', 'more', 'talented', 'actor', 'Gere', 'Not', 'only', 'are', 'motivations', 'learn', 'dance', 'far', 'more', 'profound', 'relationship', 'female', 'much', 'more', 'complex', 'instance', 'when', 'Gere', 'first', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'window', 'train', 'be', 'thinking', 'Hey', 'nice-looking', 'woman', 'When', 'Sugiyama', 'first', 'Mai', 'Kishikawa', 'can', 'see', 'electricity', 'pass', 'tormented', 'soul', 'immediately', 'drawn', 'her.This', 'brings', 'next', 'point', 'casting', 'main', 'female', 'lead', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'reasonably', 'talented', 'actress', 'attractive', 'enough', 'nothing', 'role', 'attractive', 'talented', 'actress', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'brought', 'clearly', 'actress', 'who', 'learned', 'dance', 'role', 'rather', 'dancer', 'first', 'Mai', 'Kishikawa', 'much', 'more', 'authentic', 'Tamiyo', 'look', 'grace', 'natural', 'dancer', 'Lopez', 'simply', 'never', 'believed', 'Lopez', 'Paulina', 'could', 'be', 'world-class', 'competitive', 'dancer', 'Tamiyo', 'wholly', 'believable', 'Also', 'Paulina', 'across', 'woman', 'getting', 'long-time', 'relationship', 'ended', 'badly', 'Tamiyo', 'woman', 'devastated', 'apparent', 'destruction', 'life-long', 'dream', 'Japanese', 'version', 'principal', 'leads', 'are', 'motivated', 'emptiness', 'soul', 'American', 'version', 'are', 'just', 'bored', 'little', 'lonely', 'Totally', 'different.The', 'third', 'character', 'wife', 'also', 'difference', 'two', 'films', 'Japanese', 'version', 'lonely', 'repressed', 'housewife', 'forced', 'hire', 'detectives', 'unable', 'confront', 'cold', 'distant', 'husband', 'strange', 'behavior', 'emotionally', 'repressive', 'culture', 'simply', 'wo', ""n't"", 'allow', 'deal', 'directly', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'wife', 'other', 'hand', 'gregarious', 'highly', 'succesful', 'executive', 'befuddlement', 'husband', 'abscenses', 'simply', 'made', 'sense', 'Why', 'not', 'just', 'ask', 'rather', 'spend', 'thousand', 'dollars', 'investigators', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'behavior', 'all.This', 'brings', 'whole', 'cultural', 'context', 'film', 'Shall', 'Dansu', 'portrayed', 'Japan', 'emotionally', 'repressed', 'place', 'where', 'husbands', 'are', 'unable', 'publically', 'even', 'privately', 'show', 'affection', 'wives', 'where', 'learning', 'dance', 'considered', 'unmanly', 'Koji', 'secrecy', 'sense', 'here', 'simply', ""n't"", 'true', 'contemporary', 'America', 'My', 'wife', 'immigrant', 'very', 'astute', 'observer', 'culture', 'asked', 'as', 'soon', 'movie', 'was', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'Richard', 'Gere', 'just', 'take', 'wife', 'dancing', 'had', 'good', 'answer', 'difference', 'even', 'clearer', 'character', 'coworker', 'who', 'secretly', 'Latin', 'dancing', 'Japanese', 'version', 'wig', 'hide', 'own', 'identity', 'take', 'wholly', 'new', 'one', 'American', 'version', 'wig', 'just', 'ridiculous', 'prop', 'Why', 'was', 'so', 'ashamed', 'let', 'coworkers', 'know', 'danced', 'scene', 'where', 'made', 'fun', 'did', ""n't"", 'ring', 'true', 'all.Shall', 'Dansu', 'then', 'had', 'far', 'more', 'talented', 'cast', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'investigation', 'culture', 'Shall', 'Dance', 'challenge', 'not', 'feel', 'joy', 'heart', 'watching', 'Save', 'money', 'skip', 'disappointing', 'remake']",N/A

Many find themselves sinking into a mundane lifestyle while being helpful toward their partner, which often is the result of meeting the partner halfway.  This routine can turn into a monotonous journey where the person in the relationship could forget personal joy in the pursuit of keeping the partner happy.  Sometimes this leads to a break up, or divorce, as the person seeks alternative ways outside the relationship to find a route back to personal happiness in life.In Shall We Dance the audience finds the estate lawyer John Clark (Richard Gere) pondering existential purpose in life.  Often John thinks about life and his existence, as he reflects over previous meetings with clients due to someone's written will.  This pondering often takes place on the ""L"", which is the local train system within the Chicago area.  Recently has John's contemplations drifted toward happiness, which his wife Beverly (Susan Sarandon) prompted after having celebrated one of his middle age birthdays with his family.John is not unhappy, but he feels that there is something missing -- something better in life.  One evening on his way home on the ""L"" he sees a woman standing by a window.  Intrigued by the woman's face he keeps seeking her every evening with his eyes on the way home from work.  He notices that the woman stands in a dance studio and one day he musters up enough courage to visit it.John enters the dance studio gazing at the mysterious woman, who he later finds out is named Paulina (Jennifer Lopez).  In the dance studio John is pushed into taking ballroom-dancing lessons through which he meets Chic (Bobby Cannavale) and Vern (Omar Benson Miller).  They all have different motives to take dance lessons, but the theme is the same as they all are there because of an attractive partner.  Vern is getting married and wants to impress his fianc&eacute; while Chic wants to use his skills in dancing to impress the girls.  However, as they learn how to take the proper steps, they also find out that dance is something sensual, expressive, and artistic.Secretively John continues to dance as he pursues Paulina, however, Beverley is getting suspicious, as he appears more joyful. Beverly hires a private detective to find out what John is doing that is making him so happy, as she suspects that he might be having an affair.  One evening when John advances on Paulina, she expresses firmly that she does not see students.  Mildly hurt John decides not to go back to the studio, but against his decision he returns to the dance studio, as it actually appears to bring him joy.The story is directed by Peter Chelsom who also made Serendipity (2001) and Funny Bones (1995), but this time he is making a remake.  Shall We Dance turns out to be another Japanese story, as the big production companies in Hollywood have recently decided to turn to the east for new material.  This has given the audience films such as Ring (2002) and Grudge (2004).  The tradition to make remake is not new in Hollywood, as Three Men and a Baby originated from France while Last Man Standing was based on Kurosawa's story Yojimbo (1961).  The question is whether the audience needs to see remakes, which might be argued from both sides of the issue.  Nevertheless, Shall We Dance provides a good cinematic experience, which offers joyful tears and cheering laughter.  The film gives a Western version of this story, and it still provides valuable lessons in regards to family, happiness, and self-actualization.",4,Middle Age Crisis Takes a Joyful Swing in Remake...,1107475200,"02 4, 2005",2005,3664,"['Accommodating', 'someone', 'else', 'can', 'be', 'helpful', 'maintain', 'peace', 'happiness', 'joy', 'relationship', 'can', 'also', 'affect', 'person', 'relationship', 'negatively', 'Many', 'find', 'sinking', 'mundane', 'lifestyle', 'being', 'helpful', 'partner', 'often', 'result', 'meeting', 'partner', 'halfway', 'routine', 'can', 'turn', 'monotonous', 'journey', 'where', 'person', 'relationship', 'could', 'forget', 'personal', 'joy', 'pursuit', 'keeping', 'partner', 'happy', 'Sometimes', 'break', 'up', 'divorce', 'person', 'alternative', 'ways', 'relationship', 'find', 'route', 'back', 'personal', 'happiness', 'life.In', 'Shall', 'Dance', 'audience', 'estate', 'lawyer', 'John', 'Clark', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'pondering', 'existential', 'purpose', 'life', 'Often', 'John', 'life', 'existence', 'previous', 'meetings', 'clients', 'due', 'someone', 'written', 'will', 'pondering', 'often', 'place', 'L', 'local', 'train', 'system', 'Chicago', 'area', 'Recently', 'John', 'contemplations', 'drifted', 'happiness', 'wife', 'Beverly', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'prompted', 'having', 'celebrated', 'one', 'middle', 'age', 'birthdays', 'family.John', 'not', 'unhappy', 'something', 'missing', 'something', 'better', 'life', 'One', 'evening', 'way', 'home', 'L', 'woman', 'standing', 'window', 'Intrigued', 'woman', 'face', 'seeking', 'evening', 'eyes', 'way', 'home', 'work', 'woman', 'dance', 'studio', 'one', 'day', 'up', 'enough', 'courage', 'visit', 'it.John', 'enters', 'dance', 'studio', 'gazing', 'mysterious', 'woman', 'who', 'later', 'out', 'named', 'Paulina', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'dance', 'studio', 'John', 'pushed', 'taking', 'ballroom-dancing', 'lessons', 'Chic', 'Bobby', 'Cannavale', 'Vern', 'Omar', 'Benson', 'Miller', 'have', 'different', 'motives', 'take', 'dance', 'lessons', 'theme', 'same', 'are', 'there', 'attractive', 'partner', 'Vern', 'getting', 'married', 'impress', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Chic', 'use', 'skills', 'dancing', 'impress', 'girls', 'However', 'learn', 'how', 'take', 'proper', 'steps', 'also', 'find', 'out', 'dance', 'something', 'sensual', 'expressive', 'artistic.Secretively', 'John', 'dance', 'Paulina', 'however', 'Beverley', 'getting', 'suspicious', 'more', 'joyful', 'Beverly', 'private', 'detective', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'John', 'doing', 'making', 'so', 'happy', 'might', 'be', 'having', 'affair', 'One', 'evening', 'when', 'John', 'Paulina', 'firmly', 'not', 'see', 'students', 'Mildly', 'hurt', 'John', 'not', 'go', 'back', 'studio', 'decision', 'dance', 'studio', 'actually', 'bring', 'joy.The', 'story', 'directed', 'Peter', 'Chelsom', 'who', 'also', 'made', 'Serendipity', '2001', 'Funny', 'Bones', '1995', 'time', 'making', 'remake', 'Shall', 'Dance', 'out', 'be', 'Japanese', 'story', 'big', 'production', 'companies', 'Hollywood', 'have', 'recently', 'decided', 'turn', 'east', 'new', 'material', 'given', 'audience', 'films', 'such', 'Ring', '2002', 'Grudge', '2004', 'tradition', 'make', 'remake', 'not', 'new', 'Hollywood', 'Three', 'Men', 'Baby', 'originated', 'France', 'Last', 'Man', 'Standing', 'was', 'based', 'Kurosawa', 'story', 'Yojimbo', '1961', 'question', 'audience', 'see', 'remakes', 'might', 'be', 'argued', 'sides', 'issue', 'Nevertheless', 'Shall', 'Dance', 'good', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'joyful', 'tears', 'cheering', 'laughter', 'film', 'Western', 'version', 'story', 'still', 'valuable', 'lessons', 'regards', 'family', 'happiness', 'self-actualization']",N/A

But, Shall We Dance was something I can relate too-John Clark is on of those suburbanites who has been pressing the snooze button throughout his life, he looks sedated and depressed unable to take happiness in the things people tell us to take happiness in. Suddenly when he sees Lopez standing in the window of a dance studio looking the way on the outside as, he feels on inside he decides to take up ballroom dancing classroom. A brief life changing decisions in which he finds new friends, happiness, and a new zest for life. Decidingly John decides to hide this new passion from his family. Only problem is John's wife and daughter have been noticing the late nights at work and his new happiness. Sarandon thinking he is having an affair tracks down a private eye to follow John to only find out he is hiding dancing. Well, Sarandon and her daughter show up at a competition to watch John dance.When this movie finished I felt myself relating to John's new love for dance- for all of us have to find hidden passions for ourselves that make life barable. I was unable to understand why John tried to keep this a secret from his family. I also totally didn't see the connection between him and J-Lo there seemed to be no attraction or friendship between the two.But, what really keeps this movie going is Richard Gere he is so sweet and lovable as John Clark I found myself wanting to hug him as I watch him dance.

One day he spots a gorgeous lady staring out a window.  He sees that it's a dancing school.  The very next day on his way home from work, he spots the same lady again staring out the window.

He meets a few new friends who are also first-time dancers.Nice story, but very predictable.Stanley Tucci is hilarious as Link, a white guy who pretends to be Hispanic.

It's hard to translate the cultural aspects, which play a major role in the original Japanese version, but they managed to recreate that part of the conflict quite nicely.As a ballroom dancer, I was somewhat torn with this movie.  There were some very obvious glaring errors in it, for anyone who knows ANYTHING about ballroom dancing.  However, the story was enjoyable enough and the characters likable enough that it generally made up for it.Richard Gere truly shines in this film.  After the hit film ""Chicago,"" it became obvious that Gere has quite a talent for dancing, and it was wonderful that he was able to further improve that particular gift in this show.  Gere has an undeniable presence on the screen, which added so much to his role in ""Shall We Dance.""  His character was charming and real, and I found myself really cheering for him.

If I didn't know better, I'd say he'd been doing ballroom for much longer than it took to make this film.Susan Sarandon was completely believable as his wife, and I liked her as much as I liked Gere.  I wanted to see even more of her.  I think my favorite scene with her was when she was trying to learn a little about ballroom dancing herself, secretly trying to gain understanding from a book and dancing in the bedroom just as her husband had done so covertly.Stanley Tucci was, as always, brilliantly hilarious in his role as Gere's coworker.  Playing a Latin dancer trying to hide his passion for the sport, Tucci provides a good amount of the comedy in this show.  I wasn't quite expecting his role to be what it was, and he isn't the dancer that Gere is, but it's obvious he had fun with it, and that was great to watch.  I thought he was perfect for that role.While I did enjoy Jennifer Lopez's dancing, I must confess that I found her character a little too two-dimensional for my taste.  She was actually one of my LEAST favorite characters in the piece, and I didn't quite buy her as a professional dancer in the flashbacks --- especially since she was dancing with one of the best standard ballroom dancers in the world, Gary McDonald.  However, I did thoroughly enjoy the scene in which she taught Gere how to feel the music, using an incredible tango I had never heard before.The music in this show is quite good.  You really need good music in a dance movie, and this has an excellent soundtrack, which I dance to all the time.  The tango especially is quite unique --- sort of a cross between a tango and a rumba.The costumes are also quite impressive.  Designs by Randall contributed the ballroom costumes, and in fact, I have seen a couple of those costumes in action before, at real competitions!  That was a neat connection I was able to make.The complaints I had about the movie were few, actually.  My biggest problem was during the Latin competition.  They spent all this time talking about the rumba --- and Gere even MENTIONS that the Novice dances are rumba and cha-cha --- and then at the actual competition, suddenly they're doing a paso doble?!?  That was incredibly annoying, especially with all the build-up they had beforehand.  And frankly, you will never EVER see a paso doble done at the Novice level at competition, it's always rumba and either cha-cha or samba.  I was at a complete loss as to why they did that.Other than that, there were just little things that a ballroom dancer would easily catch, and Tucci drops a competely unnecessary f-bomb.But on the whole, this is a fun movie, and one I would recommend to most people.  I would like to see Richard Gere do MORE dancing movies in future!",4,"Not as good as the original, but still worth a watch",1121040000,"07 11, 2005",2005,3731,"['As', 'far', 'remakes', 'go', 'one', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'hard', 'translate', 'cultural', 'aspects', 'play', 'major', 'role', 'original', 'Japanese', 'version', 'managed', 'recreate', 'part', 'conflict', 'quite', 'ballroom', 'dancer', 'was', 'somewhat', 'torn', 'movie', 'were', 'very', 'obvious', 'glaring', 'errors', 'anyone', 'who', 'ANYTHING', 'ballroom', 'dancing', 'However', 'story', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'enough', 'characters', 'likable', 'enough', 'generally', 'made', 'up', 'it.Richard', 'Gere', 'truly', 'film', 'hit', 'film', 'Chicago', 'became', 'obvious', 'Gere', 'quite', 'talent', 'dancing', 'was', 'wonderful', 'was', 'able', 'further', 'improve', 'particular', 'gift', 'show', 'Gere', 'undeniable', 'presence', 'screen', 'added', 'so', 'much', 'role', 'Shall', 'Dance', 'character', 'was', 'charming', 'real', 'found', 'really', 'cheering', 'heck', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'seeing', 'do', 'more', 'ballroom', 'dancing', 'really', 'great', 'feel', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'better', ""'d"", 'say', ""'d"", 'been', 'doing', 'ballroom', 'much', 'longer', 'took', 'make', 'film.Susan', 'Sarandon', 'was', 'completely', 'believable', 'wife', 'liked', 'as', 'much', 'liked', 'Gere', 'wanted', 'see', 'even', 'more', 'think', 'favorite', 'scene', 'was', 'when', 'was', 'trying', 'learn', 'little', 'ballroom', 'dancing', 'secretly', 'trying', 'gain', 'understanding', 'book', 'dancing', 'bedroom', 'just', 'husband', 'had', 'done', 'so', 'covertly.Stanley', 'Tucci', 'was', 'always', 'brilliantly', 'hilarious', 'role', 'Gere', 'coworker', 'Playing', 'Latin', 'dancer', 'trying', 'hide', 'passion', 'sport', 'Tucci', 'good', 'amount', 'comedy', 'show', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'expecting', 'role', 'be', 'what', 'was', ""n't"", 'dancer', 'Gere', 'obvious', 'had', 'fun', 'was', 'great', 'watch', 'thought', 'was', 'perfect', 'role.While', 'did', 'enjoy', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'dancing', 'must', 'confess', 'found', 'character', 'little', 'too', 'two-dimensional', 'taste', 'was', 'actually', 'one', 'LEAST', 'favorite', 'characters', 'piece', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'buy', 'professional', 'dancer', 'flashbacks', 'especially', 'was', 'dancing', 'one', 'best', 'standard', 'ballroom', 'dancers', 'world', 'Gary', 'McDonald', 'However', 'did', 'thoroughly', 'enjoy', 'scene', 'taught', 'Gere', 'how', 'feel', 'music', 'using', 'incredible', 'tango', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'before.The', 'music', 'show', 'quite', 'good', 'really', 'need', 'good', 'music', 'dance', 'movie', 'excellent', 'soundtrack', 'dance', 'time', 'tango', 'especially', 'quite', 'unique', 'sort', 'cross', 'tango', 'rumba.The', 'costumes', 'are', 'also', 'quite', 'impressive', 'Designs', 'Randall', 'contributed', 'ballroom', 'costumes', 'fact', 'have', 'seen', 'couple', 'costumes', 'action', 'real', 'competitions', 'was', 'neat', 'connection', 'was', 'able', 'make.The', 'complaints', 'had', 'movie', 'were', 'few', 'actually', 'biggest', 'problem', 'was', 'Latin', 'competition', 'spent', 'time', 'talking', 'rumba', 'Gere', 'even', 'MENTIONS', 'Novice', 'dances', 'are', 'rumba', 'cha-cha', 'then', 'actual', 'competition', 'suddenly', ""'re"", 'doing', 'paso', 'doble', 'was', 'incredibly', 'annoying', 'especially', 'build-up', 'had', 'beforehand', 'frankly', 'will', 'never', 'EVER', 'see', 'paso', 'doble', 'done', 'Novice', 'level', 'competition', 'always', 'rumba', 'cha-cha', 'samba', 'was', 'complete', 'loss', 'why', 'did', 'that.Other', 'were', 'just', 'little', 'things', 'ballroom', 'dancer', 'would', 'easily', 'catch', 'Tucci', 'competely', 'unnecessary', 'f-bomb.But', 'whole', 'fun', 'movie', 'one', 'would', 'recommend', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'do', 'MORE', 'dancing', 'movies', 'future']",N/A
866897,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0006GAI6O,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 5]","When asked to name the sexiest scene I have ever seen in a movie I usually answer the ""Shall We Dance?"" sequence from ""The King and I.""  Most people acknowledge that the more you see of two people having sex the less sexier it is.  Well, two people fully clothed and dancing is pretty far removed from triple-X nudity sex, but you will not see a more powerful look than the one Yul Brynner gives Deborah Kerr at the end of that dance.  You do not have to understand metaphor, but in the 2004 romantic comedy ""Shall We Dance"" Jennifer Lopez's character explains exactly what is happening during such dances when she calls them ""the vertical expression of a horizontal wish.""  There are few things more elegant and sensual than a dance of seduction.This being said, it is all the more interesting that ""Shall We Dance"" is about passion but that it is actually about dancing more than it is about sex.  But it certainly plays with our assumption that the two are inexorably connection, whether we pick up that notion from Fred Astaire or ""Dirty Dancing.""  John Clark (Richard Gere) is a lawyer stuck in a routine both at work and at home.  He gets from one to the other via the L train and on his way home he see a woman sitting in the window of Miss Mitzi's Dance Studio.  He sees her sitting there again and then catches a glimpse of her dancing.  The next thing he knows he is getting off the train, walking up the stairs, entering the dance studio and signing up for lessons.The obvious conclusion is that John is drawn out of his lethargy by this tantalizing woman, whose name is Pauline.  This is especially true because Pauline is played by Jennifer Lopez.  But even if it takes him a way to come to the realization, John is not there for the woman: he is there for the dancing.  His confusion is understandable because it seems everybody at Miss Mitzi's is there under false or at least misguided pretenses.  That includes John's classmates, the oversized Vern (Omar Benson Miller) and the homophobic Chic (Bobby Cannavale), and his co-worker, Link (Stanley Tucci) who dons a wig to transform himself into a dancing fool.With John coming home late every Wednesday, making strange body movements when he thinks he is alone, and having perfume on his shirts, his wife, Beverly (Susan Sarandon) has to face her suspicions and her fears.  This involves hiring a sympathetic private detective (Richard Jenkins), who is clearly smitten by the lady, oblivious to his strange non-verbal habits, and impressed by John's secret.  Beverly learns her husband's secret and comes to a rather different but actually compelling reaction.  Meanwhile, all of the film's plot threads are going to come together at the big ballroom dancing competition that is the big moment but not the film's climax.  ""Shall We Dance"" has more than one of those, which should not be surprising.The character of Pauline is caught in limbo for most of the film.  When we first see her, sitting in the window of the dance studio, she is a silent siren.  But when John actually talks to her I was suddenly thinking that she was a Sandra Bullock girl-next-door sort of character.  Then she turns cold and distant until we get a quick glimpse of passion when she explains the correct way to dance the Rumba before she shows John how it should be done on the dance floor in the film's hottest ""sex"" scene.Director Peter Chelsom (whose 1995 comedy ""Funny Bones"" takes place largely at Blackpool, the Mecca of Ballroom Dancing) and writer Audrey Wells (""The Truth About Cats and Dogs"") had to face the daunting task of coming up with an American (and Americanized) version of the 1996 Japanese film ""Shall we dansu?"" by writer-director Masayuki Suo, one of the most successful foreign films of relatively recent vintage.  I watched the remake last night and the original this morning, and if my preference like so many others is for the Japanese version it has to do with the profoundly different way that culture views ballroom dancing more than anything else.  This being said, both films are enjoyable.But I actually think the remake suffers from the casting of its three stars.  It is not surprising that Richard Gere cuts quite a figure on the dance floor, but it seems strange that a woman can resist his charms or that he is leading a life of quite desperation.  Jennifer Lopez is so dynamic that you keep thinking her character is slumming by hanging out at Miss Mitzi's Dance Studio.  As for Susan Sarandon, it is rather hard to believe she is not more pro-active in dealing with the situation she has discovered.  Consequently, I can make the case that the casting is too good for this movie, even though watching Gere dance with his leading ladies are the high points of the film.  With Gere as the lead you still end up thinking the rich are getting richer, as opposed to the idea that every worm has its day that you get from the original.Still, ""Shall We Dance"" is quite enjoyable, especially if you like your romantic comedies to be cute.  This is especially true of the supporting cast of aforementioned characters along with the charming Miss Mitzi (Anita Gillette), the bombastic Bobbie (Lisa Ann Walter), and the quotable Scott (Nick Cannon).  The story manages to avoid all of the standard scenes we usually get when a husband is not having an affair, and actually comes up with some rather creative responses to the unusual situation.  True, these are mostly from Suo's script, but given the proclivity of American studios to stick to conventions being this faithful to the original is a rare treat.  Plus, there is all that dancing.",4,Worth seeing whether or not you have seen the original,1107561600,"02 5, 2005",2005,5615,"['When', 'asked', 'name', 'sexiest', 'scene', 'have', 'ever', 'seen',

What did I miss?I went to see this movie for the dancing, Susan Sarandon and Richard Gere, in that order. I hoped it would have something to say about marriage, romance and dance. Although there were some good individual scenes, I mostly felt the movie never jelled.The comedy scenes were self-conscious, as if directed by someone who couldn't do comedy; the dramatic scenes were a little better, but hampered by a total lack of real character development. We never know these people well enough to care.That was particularly, painfully true of the Jennifer Lopez character. That wasn't entirely her fault. She's given little to do, not even enough dancing in the movie.The two scenes of semi-romantic banter with Richard Gere were particularly painful to watch. They have no chemistry, and the dialogue is banal and not even original. Unless I'm much mistaken, their exchange about suede coats, stains and cows comes from a Seinfeld episode. This would have been fine if they'd referenced it; as it is, it's just a rip off.The best scenes in the movie are those between Sarandon and the detective, with their hint of romantic possibilities. Still, Sarandon's big scene in which she explains the meaning of marriage, though great, felt out of step with the rest of the movie.The final flaw was that I felt Gere was miscast. He did fine in the dancing. It's great to see a man willing to work at that and I had no problem with it. (And got a kick out of character's explanation for why he's taking dance classes: ""I'm lousy in bed, like Chic."")Still, it was hard to accept him as a man worn out and bored by life. The movie didn't have enough depth of script, direction or acting to overcome the vitality he projects. At least not for me.As it was I spent most of the movie trying to figure out what was the basic problem: script, direction or editing. I'm still not sure. It did have some feel good moments. The best part turned out to be the end, when they show what happened to everyone. The audience seemed relatively pleased, though some described it as OK or not bad.

Richard Gere plays a man that is in very happy 19-year marriage with a wonderful family. But he feels he is missing something...his mid-life crisis perhaps. He sees Jennifer Lopez's character every night on his way home and this grabs his attention. He has to meet her, and she just happens to work at a dance studio.So we watch as he fumbles his way into taking dance lessons in order to meet her. And he starts the dance lessons. One evening Jennifer characters tells him if he is there for her, he should quit. After taking stock in the situation, he realizes he loves dancing. Yet all this time his wife is worried that he may be having an affair.I am pleased how the movie turned out. We need more movies where the family truly loves each other and nothing torrid happens. For there are couples that are truly happily married and people should be aware of it. This movie shows us in a genuinely soft romantic way. The cast of characters for this movie is perfect and they work well together. And the Latin and ballroom dancing is a nice medium to show us this in.

866907,A129YBX5BVNW2,B0006GAI6O,"Mark Barry ""Mark Barry""","[1, 1]","*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE BLU RAY VERSION ***Whenever I'm asked by friends for a movie to lift up a dreary Monday evening after a tough day at the job, I reach for ""Shall We Dance"".They then look at the outer sleeve with sneering suspicion, shake their heads and check my pulse.Richard Gere and J-Lo! Ballroom Dancing!! Are you mad!!!But they always come back a few days later saying how much they genuinely loved it...Susan Sarandon and Richard Gere play Beverly and John Clark who are happily married and living in their affluent suburban mansion. They've a well-balanced life with an equally well-balanced daughter and all seems to be in order.  But his job as a Chicago Estate Lawyer dealing with other people's wills has become tedious and their same-old existence at home quietly stagnant. One evening heading home after work on the overhead L train, John looks up into ""Miss Mitzi's Dancing School"" and sees a beautiful woman standing at the window (Jennifer Lopez). Several evenings and sightings later, he finally gets off the train, goes in and unwittingly enrols in Ballroom Dancing classes - and of course everything changes...Peter Chelsom's 2004 remake of the 1996 Japanese film ""Shall We Dansu?"" is as lovely as film gets - and its transition to BLU RAY is a real triumph.The picture is GLORIOUS throughout - far better than the DVD - beautifully framed by cinematographer John De Borman. There are so many scenes now where the detail hits you - the texture of his coat on the train home - the look of the wet streets outside the studio - his tie as he stands by the fridge in his perfect kitchen, the scuffed and scratched wooden floorboards of the Mitzi's studio - Stanley Tucci's character Link wiping false tan off his face (his Latin lothario look) as he discusses his secret passion for the Rumba and Tango with work colleague John - it 'all' looks so clear.As with all great films, there's a combination of things that make it work. First up is the fabulous support cast who very nearly steal the film from the leads - Stanley Tucci and Lisa Ann Walter in particular are like Bette Midler and husband - ball-breakingly funny, ratty with each other, but ultimately human and touching. There's the huge but lovable Omar trying to lose a few pounds to propose to his girlfriend (Omar Miller from 8 Mile), the macho and deceptively deep Chic played brilliantly by Bobby Cannavale (from The Station Agent) who wants to score with women (or so he thinks) - Susan Sarandon admirably downplaying the acting hysterics as John's suspicious wife who then hires Richard Jenkins (the dead father in Six Feet Under) and Nick Cannon to investigate...and on it goes to revelations none of them were expecting...John O'Connell did the choreography (Strictly Ballroom and Moulin Rouge) with Richard Gere admirably putting in 4 months of intensive training to get it right. Then there's the score by John Altman during the dance numbers which is such great fun - itself sided by Gabriel Yared's beautiful piano refrain infusing so many of the quieter scenes with an old-school romance and class. And of course the movie's trump-card - the elegant, sexy and sleek Jennifer Lopez who's in her element as Paulina the spurned Ballroom champion. She wins praise from her co-cast and director - and rightly so.The Special Features on the BLU RAY are:1. Audio commentary by the Director Peter Chelsom2. Deleted Scenes (About 17 Minutes) With Commentary by Peter Chelsom3. Behind The Scenes Of ""Shall We Dance"" - interviews with all the cast, director, producers etc4. Beginners Ballroom5. The Music Of (John Altman and Gabriel Yared who did the principal score; Mya's version of David Bowie's ""Let's Dance"" and The Pussycat Dolls update of Dean Martin's ""Sway"" including behind the scenes at the video shoot and interviews with Mya and Nicole KeaLike ""The Full Monty"", ""Sleepless In Seattle"" or ""When Harry Met Sally"" - ""Shall We Dance"" is a bit of a modern day gem. Ok it won't make the top 50 best films every made - but it will talcum powder its way into your heart and stay there. And on BLU RAY it's a winner.Recommended.PS: Peter Chelsom has made other really great films worth checking out - ""Hear My Song"", ""The Mighty"", ""Serendipity"" and the wonderfully quirky ""Funny Bones"" which is set in his hometown of Blackpool in coastal England",5,"""....

866912,A1DL822FZZQA00,B0006GAI6O,"Michael E. Hill ""Major Rassendyll""","[3, 3]","In ""Shall We Dance?"",  Richard Gere plays John Clark, a successful Chicago attorney.  He's got  a beautiful, successful wife (played by Susan Sarandon) and two normal, well-adjusted children.  However unknown to those closest to him, Mr. Clark is unhappy.One day on his way home from work, he sees a beautiful woman (Jennifer Lopez) looking out a window of a dance studio.  She looks exactly the way he feels.  On impulse he leaves his train and enters the dance studio.  Confronted by `Paulina', he can think of nothing else but sign up for lessons.  It is through ballroom dancing he experiences joy and finds new friends.  His lessons are secret but his family notices a change in him.......This film functions well on all levels.  It's about being yourself.  It's about the need for artistic expression.  Also it is about the sanctity of marriage and the basic human need for intimacy.  The supporting actors are brilliant especially Stanley Tucci as John Clark's law partner who maintains a secret life as a Latin dancer.  He hides his dream as under a ridiculous wig behind false teeth.  The school is run by alcoholic Miss Mitzi played by Anita Gillette in a fine subtle performance.Lisa Ann Walter plays Bobbi a woman that is anything but subtle.  She hides her insecurities and frustrations with life under an obnoxious personality.  Jennifer Lopez's scene explaining the rumba is classic.  Miss Mitzi's comment afterward sums it up perfectly..... :-)The dance performances are superb.  Except for Jennifer Lopez, none of the principal characters  were trained as dancers.  In the case of Ms. Lopez she had no previous ballroom experience.  You'd never know it to see her dance.  The lack of dance experience in the other actors is beneficial to the film.  We get to see them evolve as they learn to dance and in the process grow as human beings.This film is a western remake of the excellent Japanese original.  Since it is a remake, I can't give it the highest rating. The creative staff of this remake copied the fine features of the original with western sensibilities.

866913,A1PW6G3EFXCLFJ,B0006GAI6O,"Michael W. Kennedy ""insane book lover""","[2, 3]","SHALL WE DANCE? is a Hollywood fairy tale about ballroom dancing; what is portrayed here doesn't exist in the real world. In the everyday ballroom world, many dance studios are money traps for lonely women who take years of expensive lessons only to be able ultimately to follow their young, attractive dance instructors and nobody else on the dance floor. The studio system is a racket and is not realistically portrayed in SHALL WE DANCE? But this, after all, is a love story of sorts with a ballroom background and not a documentary, so all is forgiven. We ballroom dancers will enjoy this entertaining, sweet film about our activity if only because there are so few such offerings. Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez both give subdued performances as the angst-filled lawyer and the jilted Blackpool-level dancer, respectively. What motivates the middle-aged Gere character to go to the studio in the first place is never really clear. It could be a desire for romance or just a need to accomplish something new. But then why not sky diving or fly fishing? Susan Sarandon gives a competent performance as the spouse settled ridgedly into the suburban, upper-class housewife role with blinders on. The best scene for me was when JLo (an assistant teacher at the dance studio) was explaining and demonstrating the rumba to the Gere character: ""It is a vertical expression of a horizontal wish..."" That was one of the few scenes with any emotional intensity. My favorite characters were the stereotypical private detective and his Great Books-quoting black assistant hired to follow the lawyer.

I know who that is, but what is that person's name?""This is a simply beautiful film. An artsy movie with romance, tons of funny scenes, charming characters/actors and a compelling storyline that has alot of character development.If you haven't heard, this is a movie based on its Japanese original. That one was a little different, because in Japan, touching a woman somewhere was offensive. So, for a man to dance in a jazz club, it would be socially unnaceptable. So, obviously, it's not as much developing as the characters, so to speak. Because many men in America these days dance and they don't think of it that way as they would in Japan.Well, the story is about a man from New York who spends all day working and all night worrying about it. He notices 'Miss Mitzi's Dance Studio'. So, after a long consideration, he decides to go for classes. He notices that Jennifer Lopez is only the assisstant. So, this dance thing gets to his head, he is never around, so his wife suspects he's having an affair with this J.Lo woman. So, she hires a wise-cracking dectective to spy on him.

But for all that, it has a couple of new twists (or maybe they are old twists presented in a new way.) It is nowhere as good as Masayuki Suo's enchanting ""Shall We Dance?"".I found that I empathized with several of the characters although there are some very complex characters.The final dance scene was certainly the highlight of the film for me.  It sparkled and it was kind of fun.  Totally predictable but with a slight twist at the end which provided an outcome with more depth. It proved a nice resolution to the ""tension"" that the plot builds up - or is that ""exasperation""?I know Richard G is a dancer, but somehow he never looks completely confortable in this role to me.I enjoyed the film.  I guess I would put it in the ""mindless entertainment"" category.  The story is virtually the same as the old Australian Film ""Strictly Ballroom"" of course and a remake of the Masayuki Suo film of the same name.  For my part, I enjoyed Strictly Ballroom more - even if it did seem slightly less polished acting-wise.It's good to have this in my collection. I've watched it twice but when friends call over to watch a movie, it's always overlooked.  While it's fun, it doesnt shine out as anything very special.

But the American version isn't the dog poo others are trying to lead you to believe either.  John Clark (Gere) is staring at middle age and is search for something different.  Problem is that he doesn't know what he wants and ends up finding it in weird round about way: he wants to dance.  The main mistep is the fact that we're lead to believe that Clark believes that an affair is what he wants.  It is why he goes to the dance hall in the first place.  The reason he goes night after night.  He wants to get close to Paulina (Lopez).  It isn't until Paulina tells him no way is that ever going to happen (of course, you're thinking she's out of her mind.  But hey, it's J.LO) does Clark have to do some serious soul searching on whether he wants to continue the classes.  Stanley Tucci was halarious as the wannabe giggilo Link.  But yes, there is plenty that doesn't translate well in the American West.  There is a serious problem in a marriage when a husband creates another branch of his life-friends and what have you and doesn't tell or feels like he has to hide it from his wife.  And given what was presented, Clark had no reason to do this.  I'm not saying that the man couldn't do these things, but he most certainly should tell her.  But no.  Clark wants to talk in the dead of night when his wife is asleep and then act like he's not being listened to.  C'mon buddy-wait to the woman is conscious.  The side story with the detective was just filler and felt like filler.  But it is still a delightful film and Gere is absolutely dashing in a black and white tux and holding a single red rose.

Not wanting to take it to her and find out it was offensive, I decided now was a good time to watch it.This isn't an academy award winning piece of work, but it was an enjoyable way to spend the afternoon.  It was your basic Richard Gere/Jennifer Lopez romantic comedy.  I didn't realize Stanley Tucci was in it, or I might have watched it sooner.  He is one of my favorite character actors.  I first became aware of him inUndercover Blues, which will always be an all-time favorite because of him.  He did not disappoint.  I was also pleased that there was nothing offensive in the movie (there were a total of 2 four-letter words, spoken by Stanley Tucci's character).

Zwick,"[7, 10]","***1/2The Japanese film, ""Shall We Dance?"" was one of the most commercially successful foreign language films ever released in the United States.  The almost inevitable American remake, now set in Chicago, follows the original very closely in terms of both storyline and spirit.John Clark (Richard Gere) is a successful middle-aged lawyer who has spent virtually his entire adult life devising wills for other people.  He has a happy marriage and two teenaged children who adore him, yet something still seems to be missing from his life.  One night, while riding the train home as he has done hundreds of times before, he finds himself transfixed by the image of a beautiful young woman staring out from an upper-story window of a second-rate dance studio.  Intrigued by the sight, John musters up the courage to get off the train, mosey on into the studio, and sign up for dance lessons.  As John begins to find meaning and purpose in his life, his concerned wife, Beverly (Susan Sarandon), fearing that he may in fact be having an affair, goes to a detective agency, headed by Richard Jenkins, to have the man she loves discreetly followed.Gooey moments and plot contrivances not withstanding, this is a sweet and charming film that, in its own quiet way, makes a profound statement about finding meaning in the second half of one's life.  Although the narrative and humor often have a sitcom feel to them, the overall breezy tone and good-natured ambiance of the movie win us over anyway.  And although many of the subsidiary people who populate this tale are really more caricatures than characters, at least they're colorful and well-delineated enough to add to - rather than subtract from - the central drama.Gere, Sarandon, Jenkins, Stanley Tucci, Bobby Cannavale and Lisa Ann Walter all give winning performances.  In fact, of all the actors, only Jennifer Lopez, as the beautiful young woman who teaches John a thing or two about dancing, falls short of the mark.  Ms. Lopez, for all her other undeniable talents, simply has not developed an actor's confidence on camera, and, as a result, she is unable to rise to the level of the professionals.On the other hand, the dancing alone makes the film worth watching.",3,winning romantic comedy,1130025600,"10 23, 2005",2005,2223,"['***1/2The', 'Japanese', 'film', 'Shall', 'Dance', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'commercially', 'successful', 'foreign', 'language', 'films', 'ever', 'released', 'United', 'States', 'almost', 'inevitable', 'American', 'remake', 'now', 'set', 'Chicago', 'original', 'very', 'closely', 'terms', 'storyline', 'spirit.John', 'Clark', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'successful', 'middle-aged', 'lawyer', 'who', 'spent', 'virtually', 'entire', 'adult', 'life', 'devising', 'wills', 'other', 'people', 'happy', 'marriage', 'two', 'teenaged', 'children', 'who', 'adore', 'yet', 'something', 'still', 'be', 'missing', 'life', 'One', 'night', 'riding', 'train', 'home', 'done', 'hundreds', 'times', 'before', 'transfixed', 'image', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'staring', 'out', 'upper-story', 'window', 'second-rate', 'dance', 'studio', 'Intrigued', 'sight', 'John', 'up', 'courage', 'get', 'off', 'train', 'mosey', 'studio', 'sign', 'up', 'dance', 'lessons', 'John', 'find', 'meaning', 'purpose', 'life', 'concerned', 'wife', 'Beverly', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'fearing', 'may', 'fact', 'be', 'having', 'affair', 'detective', 'agency', 'headed', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'have', 'man', 'discreetly', 'followed.Gooey', 'moments', 'plot', 'contrivances', 'not', 'withstanding', 'sweet', 'charming', 'film', 'own', 'quiet', 'way', 'profound', 'statement', 'finding', 'meaning', 'second', 'half', 'one', 'life', 'narrative', 'humor', 'often', 'have', 'sitcom', 'feel', 'overall', 'breezy', 'tone', 'good-natured', 'ambiance', 'movie', 'win', 'anyway', 'many', 'subsidiary', 'people', 'who', 'populate', 'tale', 'are', 'really', 'more', 'caricatures', 'characters', 'least', ""'re"", 'colorful', 'well-delineated', 'enough', 'add', 'rather', 'subtract', 'central', 'drama.Gere', 'Sarandon', 'Jenkins', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'Bobby', 'Cannavale', 'Lisa', 'Ann', 'Walter', 'give', 'winning', 'performances', 'fact', 'actors', 'only', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'John', 'thing', 'two', 'dancing', 'short', 'mark', 'Ms.', 'Lopez', 'other', 'undeniable', 'talents', 'simply', 'not', 'developed', 'actor', 'confidence', 'camera', 'result', 'unable', 'rise', 'level', 'professionals.On', 'other', 'hand', 'dancing', 'alone', 'film', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A
866933,A264UCDZZ6RLDN,B0006GAI6O,Russell de Ville,"[4, 4]","I really shouldn't watch a movie with the Director's Commentary before I review the film formally, but I often do. A film, like a really good book, or fine music should be able to stand on its own merits; at least that's what I've been taught. But understanding moreso Mr Chelsom's thought process and his decision making in regard to Shall We Dance has helped to raise my rating from two to three stars.In an industry where Ego is often everything to many an actor, I'm surprised and pleased that Richard Gere, Susan Sarandon and Jennifer Lopez play such understated roles. Part of this is following direction I suppose, but I find all these actors to be so self-confident in themselves and their acting abilities that they don't seem to mind the restraint.John Clark (Gere) does not go off the proverbial deep end, and his mid-life crisis is to be more aptly described as `mid-life questions.' He doesn't take the obligatory mistress, though he might have thought about it. He doesn't run out and purchase a motorcycle or take up base jumping. He just wants something a bit more, and so Ballroom Dancing comes into his life.Wife Beverly (Sarandon), though just as much the professional (Saks Fifth Avenue) as attorney Clark, has worked equally as hard to provide a good home and, despite 20-someodd-years, is still deeply in love with her husband.Paulina (Lopez) is just what she needs to be for this film, a woman who remembers a significant professional disappointment and perhaps a personal one as well. She joins Miss Mitzi's to heal her mind and retrain her body. Lopez takes a lot of hits: ""She can't act. She can't sing. She's not really a dancer."" Well, pooh on all of that! She does a number of things quite well, including her part in this film.It's a curious dichotomy that two of the `secondary' or supporting actors, Lisa Ann Walter and Stanley Tucci really go over the top. Lisa Ann is a bit too much for me, but since I'm a fan, I must forgive her. Besides, she seems to be having so much fun. As for Tucci, Mr Chelsom instructs us that he really had to stretch and work against his own persona for this roll. I'm intrigued to the point that I'd like to see some more of his work (He's a Director as well.) Anita Gillette is just enough of a `ditz' to be fun but not an embarrassment to the Human Race. In fact, it's obvious she cares for her students, though they can often exasperate her to imbibe.Even the third tier actors, including Richard Jenkins, Bobby Cannavale and Omar Miller, are given credible roles and are delightful to watch in their efforts. Jenkin's efforts as the Detective almost go against type. He's not sleazy and smarmy but basically a nice guy who seems to care about people and their wellbeing. Nick Cannon's role as Scott is such a throwaway, I didn't recognize him until I read the credits. Tamara Hope and Stark Sands as the Clark kids are more than normal; they're even quite likeable.The sets and B unit shots are adequate if not expensively budgeted. The dancing (excepting Lopez) is that of accomplished novices, as purported by the story-line. But note that Gere has by determination and study made himself quite presentable. The music is varied to fit its assigned purpose and makes for a fun soundtrack. Several legitimate stars of the Ballroom Dancing World are inserted into various cameos (Be certain to view the alternate beginning scene.)Try not to compare to the famous and fabulous dance films of the past - and not even to the Japanese version of the same title. Kick back and enjoy it on its own merits, as the light romantic comedy it is. And be sure to add the Director's commentary perhaps during the third or fourth viewing?Anyway, I'm thinking Three Stars and maybe a little more.Russell de Ville12 April 2006",3,Dance as Therapy,1144800000,"04 12, 2006",2006,3776,"['really', 'should', ""n't"", 'watch', 'movie', 'Director', 'Commentary', 'review', 'film', 'formally', 'often', 'do', 'A', 'film', 'really', 'good', 'book', 'fine', 'music', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'stand', 'own', 'merits', 'least', 'what', ""'ve"", 'been', 'taught', 'understanding', 'moreso', 'Mr', 'Chelsom', 'thought', 'process', 'decision', 'making', 'regard', 'Shall', 'Dance', 'helped', 'raise', 'rating', 'two', 'three', 'industry', 'where', 'Ego', 'often', 'everything', 'many', 'actor', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'pleased', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'play', 'such', 'understated', 'roles', 'Part', 'following', 'direction', 'suppose', 'find', 'actors', 'be', 'so', 'self-confident', 'acting', 'abilities', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'mind', 'restraint.John', 'Clark', 'Gere', 'not', 'go', 'off', 'proverbial', 'deep', 'end', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'be', 'more', 'aptly', 'described', 'mid-life', 'questions', ""n't"", 'take', 'obligatory', 'mistress', 'might', 'have', 'thought', ""n't"", 'run', 'out', 'purchase', 'motorcycle', 'take', 'up', 'base', 'jumping', 'just', 'something', 'bit', 'more', 'so', 'Ballroom', 'Dancing', 'life.Wife', 'Beverly', 'Sarandon', 'though', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'professional', 'Saks', 'Fifth', 'Avenue', 'attorney', 'Clark', 'worked', 'equally', 'as', 'hard', 'provide', 'good', 'home', '20-someodd-years', 'still', 'deeply', 'love', 'husband.Paulina', 'Lopez', 'just', 'what', 'be', 'film', 'woman', 'who', 'significant', 'professional', 'disappointment', 'perhaps', 'personal', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'Miss', 'Mitzi', 'heal', 'mind', 'retrain', 'body', 'Lopez', 'lot', 'hits', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sing', 'not', 'really', 'dancer', 'Well', 'pooh', 'number', 'things', 'quite', 'well', 'including', 'part', 'film.It', 'curious', 'dichotomy', 'two', 'secondary', 'supporting', 'actors', 'Lisa', 'Ann', 'Walter', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'really', 'go', 'top', 'Lisa', 'Ann', 'bit', 'too', 'much', ""'m"", 'fan', 'must', 'forgive', 'be', 'having', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'Tucci', 'Mr', 'Chelsom', 'really', 'had', 'stretch', 'work', 'own', 'persona', 'roll', ""'m"", 'intrigued', 'point', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'more', 'work', 'Director', 'well', 'Anita', 'Gillette', 'just', 'enough', 'ditz', 'be', 'fun', 'not', 'embarrassment', 'Human', 'Race', 'fact', 'obvious', 'students', 'can', 'often', 'exasperate', 'imbibe.Even', 'third', 'tier', 'actors', 'including', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'Bobby', 'Cannavale', 'Omar', 'Miller', 'are', 'given', 'credible', 'roles', 'are', 'delightful', 'watch', 'efforts', 'Jenkin', 'efforts', 'Detective', 'almost', 'go', 'type', 'not', 'sleazy', 'smarmy', 'basically', 'nice', 'guy', 'who', 'care', 'people', 'wellbeing', 'Nick', 'Cannon', 'role', 'Scott', 'such', 'throwaway', 'did', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'read', 'credits', 'Tamara', 'Hope', 'Stark', 'Sands', 'Clark', 'kids', 'are', 'more', 'normal', ""'re"", 'even', 'quite', 'likeable.The', 'sets', 'B', 'unit', 'shots', 'are', 'adequate', 'not', 'expensively', 'budgeted', 'dancing', 'excepting', 'Lopez', 'accomplished', 'novices', 'purported', 'story-line', 'note', 'Gere', 'determination', 'study', 'made', 'quite', 'presentable', 'music', 'varied', 'fit', 'assigned', 'purpose', 'fun', 'soundtrack', 'Several', 'legitimate', 'stars', 'Ballroom', 'Dancing', 'World', 'are', 'inserted', 'various', 'cameos', 'Be', 'certain', 'view', 'alternate', 'beginning', 'scene', 'not', 'compare', 'famous', 'fabulous', 'dance', 'films', 'past', 'not', 'even', 'Japanese', 'version', 'same', 'title', 'Kick', 'back', 'enjoy', 'own', 'merits', 'light', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'be', 'sure', 'add', 'Director', 'commentary', 'perhaps', 'third', 'fourth', 'viewing', 'Anyway', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'Three', 'Stars', 'maybe', 'little', 'more.Russell', 'Ville12', 'April', '2006']",N/A

He is a lawyer that goes through the same routine each day, and is almost in a state of stupor, until one day, riding the train home, he sees a woman at a window looking out with a forlorn expression. After that, he is hooked, and has to go there and start attending dancing lessons to find more about this mysterious femme. Paulina (Jennifer Lopez) is an instructor at the dancing studio, and lives a frustrated life ever since she was dumped by her dancing partner / lover at the summit of her career, when she was about to compete in Blackwood, the most prestigious dancing competition in the world.John is married, and even though the relationship with Paulina starts out as a professional one, there is a sense that he is cheating on Beverly (Susan Sarandon). Therefore, he starts hiding his new activity from his family and only gets to share his secret with Link (Stanley Tucci), a co-worker who leads a double life as serious lawyer during the day and a dance machine at night. With this basic set up, the movie succeeds in entertaining through a combination of elements. First, we have the unanswered question of what is going to happen between John and Paulina. Second, the variety of personalities depicted through the different characters allow for a myriad of interesting and funny dialogues. Third, the well choreographed dances allow us to enjoy the music and the artistry of several of the scenes. Finally, even though I found that Gere, Lopez and Sarandon were proficient in their roles, I have to mention Tucci as the actor that should take most of the credit for my enjoyment of this movie. He is perfect for the role he plays and every time he shows up on the screen you know that you will be laughing out loud soon.I have not watched the original Japanese version of this movie, so I have no basis for a comparison in that regard. But I do know that even though this is not a masterpiece, which by the way I do not think it is intended to be, it does deliver what it promises: an enjoyable couple of hours.

Although it doesn't break any new ground and although most (if not all) the characters are typical and standard for this type of film, Shall We Dance? still won me over in the end. This is a standard romantic comedy that that doest the one thing it should do; make you feel good, make you smile, make you feel happy.Gere plays a man who has it all. A good wife, good children, a great job and a beautiful house. And yet, he's still not as happy as he'd like to be. Every night, while riding the train home, he sees this beautiful young woman standing at the window of a dance studion, looking longingly in the distance. One day, he decides to step off the train and he enters the dance academy, a decision that will change his life forever.Although he starts taking dance lessons just to see the beautiful Paulina (Lopez), he soon realizes that he loves to dance. Even at work, he can't help but practice his steps while sitting at his desk. And yet, he cannot admit to his wife what he's been doing in hiding, afraid that telling her something was missing in his life before the dance lessons will hurt her feelings. And of course, his wife (played beautifully by Susan Sarandon), believes that her husband is having an affair. Why else would he be so happy all of a sudden?I was greatful that this one didn't turn into a will-he-or-won't-he? story. There's never any romantic spark between Gere and Lopez. Although she does offer him the one thing he'd been lacking before, she doesn't do so in love. She does it through dance.The film is fun, cute and fluffy. Gere is perfect as the romantic lead. who truly seems happy when he dances. His dance partners, funny if generic characters, are also well cast and effective. And for once, Lopez doesn't get on your nerves. Her performance is understated and, yes, effective.I wouldn't mind seeing Shall We Dance? again a few years from now.

Well a primary, basic, underlying premise to the original was the fact that public displays of affection, the dreaded PDAs, are not normative in Japan.  Ballroom dancing is a deviant behavior there, so I don't know how they thought they were going to translate, or I think maybe that would be transliterate this very interesting plot into the U.S. Midwest.  Well, they didn't even really try.  Then, they made some strange casting decisions for the stars, they needed an actor with more depth for the leading man role, and more of a Ginger (as in Fred and Ginger) for the dance instructor part.  Not that J-Lo can't dance, but she didn't get this style right.

I did think in the back of my head ""too much Susan s. in the movie, and Lopez was TOO elusive but wasn't confident enough in my assessment to write it.  But the original confirms my suspicon (guess I have better movie insticts than i thought!), that, the wife is PART of the movie but in no way is supposed to be the main idea.  The main courses were supposed to be of course Gere (and he was) and LOPEZ, which she was not.  The wife was suppose to be just background, and, having her star instead was frankly, boring!Anyway, I'll keep the rest of what I said, but w/adding there's too much surandon and too little of lopez:  Richard Gere at (what he must be like) 85 or so, gorgeous as ever playing the loyal and faithful husband to Susan S.  I like the way there was no romance between the two most beautiful characters, as predictable as that usually is - but the two are attracted to each other for deeper reasons - Gere saw in Lopez's face what he was feeling inside, and that's what attracts the two.  I've been just recently a fan of Susan S., and she doesn't dissappoint -- most of the movie has her in the scenes which is just too much, as the story is not meant for her to star but for Lopez and Gere to star.  Another treat had been the gorgeous costumes worn by Lopez - reasonable camera time was given to them from different angles.  Some of the characters are silly, specifically the fat lady and the sensual gay man--just silly and unrealistic.  I think it could have been better, I have a gripe when inferior characters take away from a potentially good movie.  Or is that just the way people act in CHICAGO?, because where I live, it's just unrealistic.  Back to the good:  Gere, Susan S., and Lopez--dream cast.

This is what happened to me with ""Shall We Dance?"", a great soft comedy that uses ballroom dancing as its vehicle for making the point that it's just not enough to be alive, you have to Live.  Just going through the motions of life but having lost the enthusiasm is the position the Richard Gere character finds himself in, with a life that's perfectly comfortable but lacking the spark.  He ends up taking a chance on something very out of character for him, clandestinely signing up for a dance class.  Any vehicle for conveying the message could have worked, but I'm glad they chose the dance motif; a ballroom dancing movie is so different from what I usually watch that that's part of what made it so great.  Genuinely funny, with a great cast of characters and the pleasure of watching unexpected relationships form (both romantic and non-romantic; the many different ways in which people can be close is another theme of this movie) and great performances from Gere, Jennifer Lopez, Susan Sarandon, Omar Miller, and the whole cast in fact, but with the show-stealing performance coming from Stanley Tucci.

How many times have you heard people around you say that they love dancing or that they don't like it at all?Next to those two kind of people you have the people that don't know what to think of it yet cause they haven't danced that much in their lives. To those people, who want to see what dancing is about or if you want to be shown what dancing can do to a human being: watch this film.Shall We Dance tells the story of John Clark, a man who takes care of people's wills for a living. He has a nice family and is happy with them, but still, something inside him doesn't feel happy. He misses something. He finally decides to take a look in a dancing school, where he starts following lessons in secret and gets his life changed.Shall We Dance is a great feelgood film that gives a nice warm feeling. First of all, the film has fantastic actors that give fine acting performances. Richard Gere portrais his character in the exact right way. He lets the character show how he feels in situations very clearly and does that realistically with a whole lot of fun. He is charming and does a fine job as the leading role.Next to Gere, there is Jennifer Lopez. If somebody is criticised on her acting skills a lot, it is Lopez. But don't you worry, Lopez does a fantastic job and is part of the feelgood factor. She acts warm, nice and shows the character's emotions in a succesfull way. Well done.The rest of the cast is one big fun group. Susan Sarandon is perfectly choisen as John's wife and does the part with good acting. The film has hilarious supporting roles from Stanley Tucci, Lisa Ann Walter, Bobby Cannavale, Omar Miller and Anita Gillette who all bring the film to a level of great comedy and romantic fun.Technically the film looks professional and perfectly fine. The dancing has been well shot and captured on camera. The editing and the lifting music together sure makes the film swing nicely. The lighting is great, the sets are fun and colorfull to see and the music is on the right track. All these elements together give the film a nice atmosphere that gives you, as the audience, a nice feeling inside. Thats what makes this film powerful in a way: the warm Atmosphere.The comedy is hilarious at some points and the film has some nice jokes. The story may be a bit obvious and predictable, it still is a lot of fun for a night of movie entertainment. Romantic, funny, swinging, even a little drama here and there gives it a nice human touch.A succesful film that lightens up one's spirit and leaves you with a nice big smile on your face.If you love dancing this film is an absolute must see for you. If you love romantic comedies, I would also recommend you this film.If you don't like dancing at all but you love the feeling you get from the movies and the vibe it gives you: just take a look, give it a try and who knows?

I was quite skeptical that the American remake would just be a copycat rip off for the people who hasn't seen the original. However, the final product was well done and faithful.Shall We Dance was an adaptation of the Japanese movie with the same name about a middle age man found life again in the ballroom dancing class that he started off with an interesting motive. John being a successful lawyer with a happy family (quite different from the Jap version in which the guy is a middle age man with a lovely family but a mortgage that is eating him up) didn't feel life is flourishing inside him. He repeated his day in day out monotonously until he accidentally stepped into a dance shcool because of a woman looking out of the window everynight. The result was it changed the lives of all the people who got involved in John's sudden passion of dancing: his wife, his colleague, the dance teacher and his classmates.The movie has a good touch on the style of the original and it managed to tell a story of not only the leads but also the supporting cast. We have a bunch of really interesting supporting cast played by very outstanding actors which made the movie full of joy and keep the movie interesting. Richard Gere as John gave a superb performance as the lost middle age man who rejuvenated himself through ballroom dancing. His lack of confidence in himself, but at the same time full of urge to want more from his newly found reactional activity had made him happy but at the same time on guard: he want to be closeted from his family and colleagues. However, it is because of this that brought his wife into the whole thing: employed two detectives to check on her husband. The scene in which Richard Gere explained to Susan Saradon the reason he closeted himself about the whole dancing thing was very well done and touching. Richard Gere had found a spot that he could relate himself with and Susan Saradon is very proficient  as a career-wise successful wife. There are sure chemistry in the acting between them. The husband and wife actually didn't have heaps of scenes together but every scene was a good portrayal of a changing and growing relationship. Jennifer Lopez as the dance teacher comparatively has a less impact on the movie. It is not because of her acting but more of her role as a self-redeeming dance teacher who lost faith in dancing because of a failure in a competition. Nonetheless, she did have her time in the movie. Especially the scene between her and Richard Gere in the street and her couching on Richard Gere before his first ever competition in life.Basically, Shall We Dance is more of an ensemble movie in a way that the movie would not look so good without the supporting class. The hard working mum who wants to be a professional dancer, the dance teacher who had her moments in life, the big guy who wants to lose weight from dancing, the spunk who came to pick up girls but end up finding something else, the closeted dancing colleague (by Stanley Tucci!) are all superb and enriched the movie in such a way that you would feel missing them when they are not around. This is a good actualisation of ensemble performance. The great part is the leads didn't attempt to outshine others as celebrity performers but work with them on the same level and gave the sparks and chemistry for a good ensemble performance.Shall We Dance is a very refreshing piece of work that hasn't exploited the originally unfairly. It is a movie that you could move your feet and dance with its rhythm. A movie could be judged by the audience response in the theatre and it is a movie that the audience did applause when the credits rolled.",5,As good as the original,1098576000,"10 24, 2004",2004,3717,"['Being', 'big', 'lover', 'original', 'Japanese', 'movie', 'was', 'quite', 'skeptical', 'American', 'remake', 'would', 'just', 'be', 'copycat', 'rip', 'people', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'original', 'However', 'final', 'product', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'faithful.Shall', 'Dance', 'was', 'adaptation', 'Japanese', 'movie', 'same', 'name', 'middle', 'age', 'man', 'found', 'life', 'again', 'ballroom', 'dancing', 'class', 'started', 'off', 'interesting', 'motive', 'John', 'being', 'successful', 'lawyer', 'happy', 'family', 'quite', 'different', 'Jap', 'version', 'guy', 'middle', 'age', 'man', 'lovely', 'family', 'mortgage', 'eating', 'up', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'life', 'flourishing', 'repeated', 'day', 'day', 'monotonously', 'accidentally', 'stepped', 'dance', 'shcool', 'woman', 'looking', 'window', 'everynight', 'result', 'was', 'changed', 'lives', 'people', 'who', 'got', 'involved', 'John', 'sudden', 'passion', 'dancing', 'wife', 'colleague', 'dance', 'teacher', 'classmates.The', 'movie', 'good', 'touch', 'style', 'original', 'managed', 'tell', 'story', 'not', 'only', 'leads', 'also', 'supporting', 'cast', 'have', 'bunch', 'really', 'interesting', 'supporting', 'cast', 'played', 'very', 'outstanding', 'actors', 'made', 'movie', 'full', 'joy', 'keep', 'movie', 'interesting', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'John', 'gave', 'superb', 'performance', 'lost', 'middle', 'age', 'man', 'who', 'rejuvenated', 'ballroom', 'dancing', 'lack', 'confidence', 'same', 'time', 'full', 'urge', 'want', 'more', 'newly', 'found', 'reactional', 'activity', 'had', 'made', 'happy', 'same', 'time', 'guard', 'want', 'be', 'closeted', 'family', 'colleagues', 'However', 'brought', 'wife', 'whole', 'thing', 'employed', 'two', 'detectives', 'check', 'husband', 'scene', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'explained', 'Susan', 'Saradon', 'reason', 'closeted', 'whole', 'dancing', 'thing', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'touching', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'had', 'found', 'spot', 'could', 'relate', 'Susan', 'Saradon', 'very', 'proficient', 'career-wise', 'successful', 'wife', 'are', 'sure', 'chemistry', 'acting', 'husband', 'wife', 'actually', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'heaps', 'scenes', 'together', 'scene', 'was', 'good', 'portrayal', 'changing', 'growing', 'relationship', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'dance', 'teacher', 'comparatively', 'less', 'impact', 'movie', 'not', 'acting', 'more', 'role', 'self-redeeming', 'dance', 'teacher', 'who', 'lost', 'faith', 'dancing', 'failure', 'competition', 'Nonetheless', 'did', 'have', 'time', 'movie', 'Especially', 'scene', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'street', 'couching', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'first', 'ever', 'competition', 'life.Basically', 'Shall', 'Dance', 'more', 'ensemble', 'movie', 'way', 'movie', 'would', 'not', 'look', 'so', 'good', 'supporting', 'class', 'hard', 'working', 'mum', 'who', 'be', 'professional', 'dancer', 'dance', 'teacher', 'who', 'had', 'moments', 'life', 'big', 'guy', 'who', 'lose', 'weight', 'dancing', 'spunk', 'who', 'came', 'pick', 'up', 'girls', 'end', 'up', 'finding', 'something', 'else', 'closeted', 'dancing', 'colleague', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'are', 'superb', 'enriched', 'movie', 'such', 'way', 'would', 'feel', 'missing', 'when', 'are', 'not', 'around', 'good', 'actualisation', 'ensemble', 'performance', 'great', 'part', 'leads', 'did', ""n't"", 'attempt', 'outshine', 'others', 'celebrity', 'performers', 'work', 'same', 'level', 'gave', 'sparks', 'chemistry', 'good', 'ensemble', 'performance.Shall', 'Dance', 'very', 'refreshing', 'piece', 'work', ""n't"", 'exploited', 'originally', 'unfairly', 'movie', 'could', 'move', 'feet', 'dance', 'rhythm', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'judged', 'audience', 'response', 'theatre', 'movie', 'audience', 'did', 'applause', 'when', 'credits', 'rolled']",N/A
866952,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0006GAI6O,Tsuyoshi,"[5, 7]","Please, listen.  ""An ordinary businessman finds a new meaning of life after jumping into the world of social dancing.""  That's the story of the original Japanese film 'Shall We Dance,' isn't it?  Mr. Everyman in suit transforms himself into something new, something he never dreamed of, right?[RICHARD GERE???] So why casting Richard Gere as Mr. John Clark, the unlikely romantic hero of the Hollywood remake?  Ok, I like him, and I think he is underrated, but Richard Gere never, ever, looks like an ordinary businessman.  Period.  I'm not talking about his acting, which is very good here.  Gere's Mr. Clark, typical family man, opens the door of a dancing school (and he commutes everyday, looking up at the window of the school), and at first he even does not a single step.  Come on!  I still remember Richard Gere tap-dancing beautifully in 'Chicago.'  And incidentally, the US version 'Shall We Dance' is set in Chicago (though shot in Winnipeg).Jennifer Lopez plays the dancing teacher Paulina, and Susan Sarandon wife of Mr. Clark, Beverly, suspecting her husband's having an affair.  The cast is not to be blamed for they are showing the best they could do, but I cannot help feeling that we are watching the photocopy of the original film.  You can spot the counterparts of the Japanese version in Stanley Tucci, Lisa Ann Walter, and Anita Gillette.  But maybe that is not the real reason if you feel that something is missing from this Peter Chelsom film.Why is the original 'Shall We Dance' so charming?  I guess the reason is simple.  The image of Japanese.  You don't think Japanese, usually thought shy people, can be dancing in the ballroom (I'm a Japanese and can say we don't either), but the film shows its unlikely moments in such a funny and delightful way.  Gere's part was played in the original by Yakusho Koji, and his (stage) name 'Yakusho' means 'public office.'  And that's the point, for he is exactly the image of the ordinary Japanese businessman.  But now the cultural background is gone, and the remaining story becomes a typical example of 'Lost in Translation.'For all its flaws, however, newer 'Shall We Dance' is not as bad as you might think.  It's a feel-good movie, and pleasant to see.

But this one isn't half bad. In the original, a bored Japanese accountant courting a midlife crisis takes ballroom dancing lessons and enters a competition. In the remake, so does a Chicago attorney (Richard Gere). His wife (Susan Sarandon) hires a private detective because she suspects he's having an affair.So why doesn't he simply tell her? Dancing is not yet criminal or shameful in Bush's America. The secretiveness worked in the original because the Japanese are wary of public physical contact. At the end, Gere tells Sarandon that, although he loves her and is happy, he didn't want to hurt her by admitting that dancing makes him happier. Uh-huh. Once you accept this tortured logic you might be able to enjoy all the stereotying, glamorizing and self-aware acting on abundant display.Gere has played so many movie lawyers (he played another dancing one in ""Chicago"") he could play them in his sleep, but he seems awake to the character here; surely this good actor has passed the bar by now. Jennifer Lopez, as his teacher, dances gracefully and mercifully is not called upon to act, which allows her character a certain mysterious distance called for in the script.

866956,A2Q457CES5ZUZ,B0006GAI6O,William Hare,"[1, 4]","""Shall We Dance"" begins with a close focus on Richard Gere a successful yuppie lawyer specializing in wills who commutes to and from his comfortable suburban Chicago home on the El.  Despite his economic success, accented by the success his wife Susan Sarandon has achieved as head of the dress buyers' department at Saks Fifth Avenue, he has a tired and discontented look, suffering from ennui.  His marriage suffers from the fact that he and Sarandon see so little of each other since their activities take care of many of their evenings as well, times they could spend together.Gere's world begins to gradually change when he looks up from his commuter's perch on the El and observes a neon sign revealing Mitzi's Ballroom Dancing School.  What catches his attention is the beautiful image of Jennifer Lopez standing in the window of the second floor dance school wearing the same sad and forlorn expression he exhibits.Finally Gere works up the nerve to climb the stairs and go inside.  He is assisted unwittingly by aggressive blonde Lisa Ann Walter, who initially asks him when she sees him standing in the stairway and blocking her entrance what he intends to do.  She allows him to carry her dancing togs and he enters with her.  While Mitzi, played by Anita Gillette, runs the studio, and provides the first lesson, Gere is clearly smitten with Lopez.  His distraction is evident when he begins his lesson by falling on his posterior.After the session he joins the other ballroom beginning students for a bite to eat at a nearby restaurant.  His curiosity toward Lopez is increased when he hears from Walter, who provides the female comedy touch for the film as an aggressively outspoken Sadie Hawkins type, that the beautiful Hispanic dancer has joined Mitzi's struggling studio since she is in a blue funk and feeling let down since losing an opportunity to win first place at the annual international ballroom dancing competition in Blackpool, England.  Walter further saucily notes that Lopez had a falling out with her partner, with whom she allegedly shared a joint interest in more than dancing.When Anita Gillette is unable to make it to class one night Lopez takes over and Gere leaves with her at the same time.  He summons up his courage and asks her to dinner.  He receives a stiff rebuff.  She tells him with stiff formality that she does not socialize with students.  After they have said their goodbyes and begin walking in opposite directions she stops him to deliver a stinging additional comment, informing him that if he joined the class in hopes of getting acquainted with her that he had better for his own sake quit immediately.Gere is obviously deflated by Lopez's cutting and candid comment, but, as he tells her at a later point in the film, he did not feel he could quit at that point, since doing so would be a tacit admission that he had joined the class to pursue her.  He continues attending and the activity begins to improve his well being, so much so that his 14-year-old daughter tells Sarandon that her father is feeling happier.  She begins suspecting that he is having an affair and puts a private detective on his tail.Eventually Anita Gillette is so enthused about the progress Gere is making that she coaxes him to team up with Lisa Walter in the Chicago ballroom dancing annual competition.  He has a penchant for the slower, romantic dances such as the waltz while his friend from work that he finds also taking classes at the school, played by Stanley Tucci, who supplies the male comedic touches, excels in the fast action and becomes Walter's partner in that competition.Lopez provides a nervous Gere with one memorable hour of extra training.  They bond as friends and she tells him that she and her partner over trained for the Blackpool competition.  The result was that her exhausted partner collapsed at a climactic point and they failed to win or take home a trophy.  In their disappointment they also split up, with a saddened Lopez taking a job with Gillette at her school.Clued in by the private detective she hired, Sarandon learns about the competition and attends with her 14-year-old daughter.  The detective tandem also attends.  While Walter falls at a strategic point and her dress is accidentally torn, preventing them from winning any honors, Gere learns that there are other ways of winning.  The ballroom activity increases his entire life perspective, as well as that of Sarandon, who anxiously seeks out his help to teach her ballroom dance technique.Audrey Wells kept the action at a brisk level in her script while director Peter Chelsom could empathize with the subject matter, having been born and raised in Blackpool, the international capital of competitive ballroom dancing.  A former Royal Shakespeare Company actor, Chelsom received his big break in 1985 by portraying a young London playwright catering to the whims of temperamental leading lady Susannah York in his first production in ""Star Quality,"" based on a Noel Coward play.",4,An Upbeat Message About Dance,1109721600,"03 2, 2005",2005,5017,"['Shall', 'Dance', 'close', 'focus', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'successful', 'yuppie', 'lawyer', 'specializing', 'wills', 'who', 'comfortable', 'suburban', 'Chicago', 'home', 'El', 'economic', 'success', 'accented', 'success', 'wife', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'achieved', 'head', 'dress', 'buyers', 'department', 'Saks', 'Fifth', 'Avenue', 'tired', 'discontented', 'look', 'suffering', 'ennui', 'marriage', 'suffers', 'fact', 'Sarandon', 'see', 'so', 'little', 'other', 'activities', 'take', 'care', 'many', 'evenings', 'well', 'times', 'could', 'spend', 'world', 'gradually', 'change', 'when', 'up', 'commuter', 'perch', 'El', 'neon', 'sign', 'revealing', 'Mitzi', 'Ballroom', 'Dancing', 'School', 'What', 'attention', 'beautiful', 'image', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'standing', 'window', 'second', 'floor', 'dance', 'school', 'wearing', 'same', 'sad', 'forlorn', 'expression', 'exhibits.Finally', 'Gere', 'up', 'nerve', 'climb', 'stairs', 'go', 'inside', 'assisted', 'unwittingly', 'aggressive', 'blonde', 'Lisa', 'Ann', 'Walter', 'who', 'initially', 'when', 'standing', 'stairway', 'blocking', 'entrance', 'what', 'do', 'carry', 'dancing', 'togs', 'Mitzi', 'played', 'Anita', 'Gillette', 'studio', 'first', 'lesson', 'Gere', 'clearly', 'smitten', 'Lopez', 'distraction', 'evident', 'when', 'lesson', 'falling', 'posterior.After', 'session', 'other', 'ballroom', 'beginning', 'students', 'bite', 'eat', 'nearby', 'restaurant', 'curiosity', 'Lopez', 'increased', 'when', 'Walter', 'who', 'female', 'comedy', 'touch', 'film', 'aggressively', 'outspoken', 'Sadie', 'Hawkins', 'type', 'beautiful', 'Hispanic', 'dancer', 'joined', 'Mitzi', 'struggling', 'studio', 'blue', 'funk', 'feeling', 'let', 'down', 'losing', 'opportunity', 'win', 'first', 'place', 'annual', 'international', 'ballroom', 'dancing', 'competition', 'Blackpool', 'England', 'Walter', 'further', 'saucily', 'Lopez', 'had', 'falling', 'out', 'partner', 'whom', 'allegedly', 'shared', 'joint', 'interest', 'more', 'dancing.When', 'Anita', 'Gillette', 'unable', 'make', 'class', 'one', 'night', 'Lopez', 'Gere', 'same', 'time', 'up', 'courage', 'dinner', 'stiff', 'rebuff', 'stiff', 'formality', 'not', 'socialize', 'students', 'have', 'said', 'goodbyes', 'begin', 'walking', 'opposite', 'directions', 'deliver', 'stinging', 'additional', 'comment', 'informing', 'joined', 'class', 'hopes', 'getting', 'acquainted', 'had', 'better', 'own', 'sake', 'quit', 'immediately.Gere', 'obviously', 'deflated', 'Lopez', 'cutting', 'candid', 'comment', 'later', 'point', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'could', 'quit', 'point', 'doing', 'so', 'would', 'be', 'tacit', 'admission', 'had', 'joined', 'class', 'pursue', 'attending', 'activity', 'improve', 'well', 'being', 'so', 'much', '14-year-old', 'daughter', 'tells', 'Sarandon', 'father', 'feeling', 'happier', 'suspecting', 'having', 'affair', 'private', 'detective', 'tail.Eventually', 'Anita', 'Gillette', 'so', 'enthused', 'progress', 'Gere', 'making', 'coaxes', 'team', 'up', 'Lisa', 'Walter', 'Chicago', 'ballroom', 'dancing', 'annual', 'competition', 'penchant', 'slower', 'romantic', 'dances', 'such', 'waltz', 'friend', 'work', 'also', 'taking', 'classes', 'school', 'played', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'who', 'male', 'comedic', 'touches', 'excels', 'fast', 'action', 'Walter', 'partner', 'competition.Lopez', 'nervous', 'Gere', 'one', 'memorable', 'hour', 'extra', 'training', 'bond', 'friends', 'partner', 'trained', 'Blackpool', 'competition', 'result', 'was', 'exhausted', 'partner', 'collapsed', 'climactic', 'point', 'failed', 'win', 'take', 'home', 'trophy', 'disappointment', 'also', 'split', 'up', 'saddened', 'Lopez', 'taking', 'job', 'Gillette', 'school.Clued', 'private', 'detective', 'hired', 'Sarandon', 'competition', '14-year-old', 'daughter', 'detective', 'tandem', 'also', 'Walter', 'strategic', 'point', 'dress', 'accidentally', 'torn', 'preventing', 'winning', 'honors', 'Gere', 'are', 'other', 'ways', 'winning', 'ballroom', 'activity', 'entire', 'life', 'perspective', 'as', 'well', 'Sarandon', 'who', 'anxiously', 'out', 'help', 'teach', 'ballroom', 'dance', 'technique.Audrey', 'Wells', 'kept', 'action', 'brisk', 'level', 'script', 'director', 'Peter', 'Chelsom', 'could', 'empathize', 'subject', 'matter', 'having', 'been', 'born', 'raised', 'Blackpool', 'international', 'capital', 'competitive', 'ballroom', 'dancing', 'former', 'Royal', 'Shakespeare', 'Company', 'actor', 'Chelsom', 'received', 'big', 'break', '1985', 'portraying', 'young', 'London', 'playwright', 'catering', 'whims', 'temperamental', 'leading', 'lady', 'Susannah', 'York', 'first', 'production', 'Star', 'Quality', 'based', 'Noel', 'Coward', 'play']",N/A
866957,A1SPB225CVTRUU,B0006GAI6O,"Wing Lee ""filmfan""","[2, 2]","I couldn't help myself comparing this movie to Strictly Ballroom, a much more entertaining and memorable ballroom dancing movie I saw way back in the '90s. This movie is funnier, but it it's dancing scenes are less stimulating, and J.Lo had very little chemistry with Richard Gere. It's not like they didn't try their best, it's just that the story is too ordinary that they did't connect well. It still featured a fine cast with some graceful performances to make it a decent comedy.Gere played John Clark, and he's bored to death of his job and mundane life. He has a wonderful and loving wife and  teenage daughter and son, but he has lost his passion for life. In order to revive himself, he started to secretly take ballroom dancing lessons at a school for amateurs, and there he met Paulina/J.Lo, a  professional ballroom dancer who lost a competition a year earlier, and ended up taking part as an instructor. Clark's collegue Link/Stanley Tucci was also there for the lessons, and he's more serious, and he wears a wig whenever he dances. Meanwhile, Sarandon suspects her husband might be having an affair,and hires a spy to check him out. Paulina and Clark became friends and she revealed to him her true passion and goal for dancing. Clark was given some serious lessons from her and would eventually go for an amateur competition. Things got rather chaotic when his wife and daughter showed up as audiences to witness him danced marvellously.Richard Gere is impressive with his dramatic and comedy moments, but his dancing scenes is no comparison to J.Lo. Susan Sarandon had some chemistry with Gere, and she managed to delivered a touching performance. Stanley Tucci is funny as usual, especially when another rival dancer pulled his wig off. J.Lo is underused in this film, and she's quite striking and stands on her own during any given dance scenes, because she was a dancer long before she became a singer and actress. Other characters served mostly as comic relief. Overall, if you expect some stunning ballroom dancing numbers, this is the wrong place for it, because this movie is not just about dancing, it's more about the impact dancing has on the lives of ordinary people.",4,Ain't No Strictly Ballroom.,1108944000,"02 21, 2005",2005,2195,"['could', ""n't"", 'help', 'myself', 'comparing', 'movie', 'Strictly', 'Ballroom', 'much', 'more', 'entertaining', 'memorable', 'ballroom', 'dancing', 'movie', 'saw', 'way', 'back', ""'90s"", 'movie', 'funnier', 'dancing', 'scenes', 'are', 'less', 'stimulating', 'J.Lo', 'had', 'very', 'little', 'chemistry', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'not', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'best', 'just', 'story', 'too', 'ordinary', ""did't"", 'connect', 'well', 'still', 'featured', 'fine', 'cast', 'graceful', 'performances', 'make', 'decent', 'comedy.Gere', 'played', 'John', 'Clark', 'bored', 'death', 'job', 'mundane', 'life', 'wonderful', 'loving', 'wife', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'son', 'lost', 'passion', 'life', 'order', 'revive', 'started', 'secretly', 'take', 'ballroom', 'dancing', 'lessons', 'school', 'amateurs', 'there', 'met', 'Paulina/J.Lo', 'professional', 'ballroom', 'dancer', 'who', 'lost', 'competition', 'year', 'earlier', 'ended', 'up', 'taking', 'part', 'instructor', 'Clark', 'collegue', 'Link/Stanley', 'Tucci', 'was', 'also', 'there', 'lessons', 'more', 'serious', 'wig', 'whenever', 'Meanwhile', 'Sarandon', 'husband', 'might', 'be', 'having', 'affair', 'spy', 'check', 'out', 'Paulina', 'Clark', 'became', 'friends', 'revealed', 'true', 'passion', 'goal', 'dancing', 'Clark', 'was', 'given', 'serious', 'lessons', 'would', 'eventually', 'go', 'amateur', 'competition', 'Things', 'got', 'rather', 'chaotic', 'when', 'wife', 'daughter', 'showed', 'up', 'as', 'audiences', 'witness', 'danced', 'marvellously.Richard', 'Gere', 'impressive', 'dramatic', 'comedy', 'moments', 'dancing', 'scenes', 'comparison', 'J.Lo', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'had', 'chemistry', 'Gere', 'managed', 'delivered', 'touching', 'performance', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'funny', 'usual', 'especially', 'when', 'rival', 'dancer', 'pulled', 'wig', 'off', 'J.Lo', 'underused', 'film', 'quite', 'striking', 'own', 'given', 'dance', 'scenes', 'was', 'dancer', 'long', 'became', 'singer', 'actress', 'Other', 'characters', 'served', 'mostly', 'comic', 'relief', 'Overall', 'expect', 'stunning', 'ballroom', 'dancing', 'numbers', 'wrong', 'place', 'movie', 'not', 'just', 'dancing', 'more', 'impact', 'dancing', 'lives', 'ordinary', 'people']",N/A

Villanueva,"[2, 4]","I had very low expectations with movie, which is probably why I thought it ok.The good thing is that Richard Gere and Susan Surandon are excellent in there roles. I'm not a Gere fan, but he was very believable in his role. The supporting characters are good. A bit ""sitcomy"" but entertaining. The ending is actually very touching.The bad news is: Jennifer Lopez. While not the worst actress out there (we'll leave that to Mariah Carey and Madonna), she's not very good. She was very distracting to the film. It's very hard to seperate Jennifer Lopez the ""actress"" and Jennifer Lopez the person. I think someone else in this role would have been better.  Lopez fans will eat this up. She dances and wears tight clothes. The whole back story of her character is rather lame, not her fault.We saw the matinee so we didn't waste that much money on it.
