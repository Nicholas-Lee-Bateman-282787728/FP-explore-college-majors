205771,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,6300185206,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[2, 2]","A great cast and some snappy dialogue make this nutty comedy about a woman who wants to divorce her husband in order to finance him by marrying a wealthy man, is everything this genre of comedy can be. Preston Sturges wrote and directed this little gem with fast pacing, and lots of little character parts to back up his stars, that help the keep the humor going throughout the film. The generous but deaf Wenie King (Robert Dudley), Sig Arno as Toto, and Arthur Hoyt as the Pullman conductor are among those that make this film take flight.Claudette Colbert sparkles, and looks heavenly in an assortment of lavish gowns, and Joel McCrea plays her handsome but penniless husband, an inventor whose ideas have never paid off. Enter myopic millionaire John D. Hackensacker III, played with marvelous ease by Rudy Vallee, who goes on a shopping spree when he meets Claudette that includes a very large diamond ring. To complicate matters, Rudy has a sophisticated and lustful sister (Mary Astor in a terrific performance), who sets her heart on Joel, because she has been led to believe he is Claudette's brother.Victor Young wrote the music, and Rudy Vallee, the legendary ""Megaphone Crooner"" of the 1930s, sings ""Goodnight Sweetheart."" Always unpredictable, ""Palm Beach Story"" is a silly, wacky farce that is written with intelligence, making it a smart and sassy comedy, with never a dull moment between chuckles.

205772,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,6300185206,Alex Udvary,"[0, 1]","There was a time when the movies were meant to be an escape from reality. Durning the 30's and 40's this was most definitely true. In the 30's we had the ""Great Depression"", so maybe older movie fans notice that movies always HAD to have a happy ending. People didn't want to see a sad, depressing movie. They wanted to be entertained. And, of course durning the 40's there was ""World War 2"". And, yet again, they're ALWAYS had to be a happy ending. It's because of this, that I take a star off and is the only fault of the movie. It all ends to ""perfectly"". Everyone is happy in the end and they all find love and they live happily ever after, how sweet! lol. Preston Sturges comedy in the beginning may make no sense to you, you'll have to wait untill the very last scene to figure out what the first scene was all about. Gerry Jeffers (Claudette Colbert) and Tom Jeffers (Joel McCrea) are a poor,I guess happy married couple. Whom will be thrown out of their appartment room unless they come some how pay their rent. Gerry (Colbert) thinks since things are going so hard for them in their marriage it's time to get a divorce. She feels it's better for the both of them to go their own way. When the room is being shown to tenants an elderly man makes his way up to Gerry's bedroom and sees that people are still living there! After Gerry gives him the story of her life. The man decides to help her by giving her rent money and some over, a lot over! When her husband finds out Tom (McCrea) he can't understand that a man would give her money without [anthing else]being involved in the picture. I was shocked to hear them use that word in this movie. I thought it would of been a bit too much for an audience in those days, of course that's child's play to what's being said in movies today. The next morning Tom finds out that Gerry is going to Palm Beach to get a divorce. This makes for a funny scene as Tom tries to stop her, it's pure slapstick. After she tries to con some men into buying her a ticket Joel meets the same man who gave his wife money and decides to give him money too! Just so he can go after his wife. Now, the whole idea of a woman going to Palm Beach to try and get a divorce so she can marry a rich man might remind some of a recent movie out now called ""Heartbreakers"". I'm sure this movie was seen as some sort of inspiration for their movie. Soon Gerry meets John D. Hackensacker the third( say that 3 times fast!) and he becomes very taken with her and she becomes very taken with his money. He's one of the richest men in the world (It's odd how she just happens to meet him isn't it. It goes back to that happy ending habit in those days). After she and Hackensacker (Rudy Vallee) send some time together she meets his sister Princess Centimillia (Mary Astor) who has one of the best characters in the movie. When Joel meets Gerry there, Gerry lies and says that Joel is not her husband but her brother, and tries to hook him up with the Princess! Now, a lot happens, and most of it is very funny, but, I don't want to spoil everything for everyone. Besides the sappy ending, ""The Palm Beach Story"" is a great movie that will make just about everyone laugh. It's a good choice to start off your collection of Sturges movies also.",4,Great Slapstick Comedy,991180800,"05 30, 2001",2001,3265,"['was', 'time', 'when', 'movies', 'were', 'meant', 'be', 'escape', 'reality', 'Durning', '30', '40', 'was', 'most', 'definitely', 'true', '30', 'had', 'Great', 'Depression', 'maybe', 'older', 'movie', 'fans', 'notice', 'movies', 'always', 'HAD', 'have', 'happy', 'ending', 'People', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'sad', 'depressing', 'movie', 'wanted', 'be', 'entertained', 'course', 'durning', '40', 'was', 'World', 'War', '2', 'yet', 'again', ""'re"", 'ALWAYS', 'had', 'be', 'happy', 'ending', 'take', 'star', 'only', 'fault', 'movie', 'perfectly', 'Everyone', 'happy', 'end', 'find', 'love', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'how', 'sweet', 'lol', 'Preston', 'Sturges', 'comedy', 'beginning', 'may', 'make', 'sense', ""'ll"", 'have', 'wait', 'very', 'last', 'scene', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'first', 'scene', 'was', 'Gerry', 'Jeffers', 'Claudette', 'Colbert', 'Tom', 'Jeffers', 'Joel', 'McCrea', 'are', 'poor', 'guess', 'happy', 'married', 'couple', 'Whom', 'will', 'be', 'thrown', 'appartment', 'room', 'come', 'how', 'pay', 'rent', 'Gerry', 'Colbert', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'so', 'hard', 'marriage', 'time', 'get', 'divorce', 'better', 'go', 'own', 'way', 'When', 'room', 'being', 'shown', 'tenants', 'elderly', 'man', 'way', 'Gerry', 'bedroom', 'people', 'are', 'still', 'living', 'there', 'Gerry', 'story', 'life', 'man', 'help', 'giving', 'rent', 'money', 'over', 'lot', 'When', 'husband', 'out', 'Tom', 'McCrea', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'man', 'would', 'give', 'money', '[', 'anthing', 'else', ']', 'being', 'involved', 'picture', 'was', 'shocked', 'hear', 'use', 'word', 'movie', 'thought', 'would', 'been', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'audience', 'days', 'course', 'child', 'play', 'what', 'being', 'said', 'movies', 'today', 'next', 'morning', 'Tom', 'out', 'Gerry', 'going', 'Palm', 'Beach', 'get', 'divorce', 'funny', 'scene', 'Tom', 'stop', 'pure', 'slapstick', 'con', 'men', 'buying', 'ticket', 'Joel', 'same', 'man', 'who', 'gave', 'wife', 'money', 'give', 'money', 'too', 'Just', 'can', 'go', 'wife', 'Now', 'whole', 'idea', 'woman', 'going', 'Palm', 'Beach', 'try', 'get', 'divorce', 'can', 'marry', 'rich', 'man', 'might', 'remind', 'recent', 'movie', 'now', 'called', 'Heartbreakers', ""'m"", 'sure', 'movie', 'was', 'seen', 'sort', 'inspiration', 'movie', 'Soon', 'Gerry', 'John', 'D.', 'Hackensacker', 'third', 'say', '3', 'times', 'fast', 'very', 'taken', 'very', 'taken', 'money', 'one', 'richest', 'men', 'world', 'odd', 'how', 'just', 'meet', ""n't"", 'back', 'happy', 'ending', 'habit', 'days', 'Hackensacker', 'Rudy', 'Vallee', 'send', 'time', 'together', 'sister', 'Princess', 'Centimillia', 'Mary', 'Astor', 'who', 'one', 'best', 'characters', 'movie', 'When', 'Joel', 'Gerry', 'there', 'Gerry', 'Joel', 'not', 'husband', 'brother', 'tries', 'hook', 'up', 'Princess', 'Now', 'lot', 'most', 'very', 'funny', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'everything', 'everyone', 'sappy', 'ending', 'Palm', 'Beach', 'Story', 'great', 'movie', 'will', 'make', 'just', 'everyone', 'laugh', 'good', 'choice', 'start', 'off', 'collection', 'Sturges', 'movies', 'also']",Palm Beach Story VHS

I recall when I was younger his famous film unfaithfully yours one of his best which did fail,was to be remade by peter sellers i believe but his death prevented that. I'm sure  of that...anyways here we have claudette colbert struggling in her marriage and make a living. This screwball comedy which seems like a film designed for carole lombard but claudette does well with it. She is probably one of the great american actresses appealing and intelligent and a god actress and the whims of changing tastes ended her career in the 50's..Robert Wagner has some nice things to say about her...back to the film. Her husband is distraught as his marriage is falling apart from intense love after 5 years things seem ritualized,even the romance after 5 years. Claudette soon departs runs away in a taxi and her husband chases after her,on a prowl. She makes it to palm beach and is romanced by a billionaire of sorts...who hates her husband and doesnt want to hand over the $99000 to her ex as an alimony type payoff...and we also have an upper crust british lady on the scene,and william demarest as a minor character...a good screenwriter knows how to breathe life in his films by making minor characters come to life and have a weight of their own...the train scene and fox hunt type antics with the dogs is great comedy. The dialogue is great to listen to throughout the film,you can listen to the talk and forget about the movie..great language and play like interactions among principals. The writer like Colbert and she comes off best in film,one of her best. He does not like the men so much,preoccupied a sthey are by those attracted to their lovers rather than their lovers emotions..and the ending will surprise as much else in this frothy and light movie which moves briskly although with serious ideas about relationships below the surface.

205775,APP5MBH2BSX6I,6300185206,"Brian Hulett ""okierazorbacker2""","[8, 16]","The innocuous title of ""The Palm Beach Story"" is a deliberate followup to the hugely successful and popular ""The Philadelphia Story.""  Both deal with divorce and remarriage, both have some outrageously funny and unforgettable moments.  The primary difference is that the story of ""The Philadelphia Story"" is as smooth and well paced as any film.  The Palm Beach version, on the other hand, moves in fits and starts like a classic car in bad need of a valve job.Writer/director Preston Sturges's work has somehow faded over the years in general, and that's a crying shame.  His best work, like ""The Lady Eve"" and ""The Miracle of Morgan's Creek,"" deserves a more well-remembered place in history; although he does still have his core of fans, he takes a back seat to such as John Ford, John Wayne, Frank Capra, Humphrey Bogart, etc., in terms of fame.  Sturges really deserves to be mentioned in the same breath, but even those more famous names had mediocre outings.  This is one of Sturges's so-so films, ultimately not as memorable as some others.  There's an outrageous sequence where a bunch of drunks shoot up a train, which finally brings the film alive when it's about 45 minutes old, and there's an apparently European gentleman who provides great comedy relief for the final half-hour.Other than these welcome bright spots, it's a screwball comedy without many laughs, just odd situations.  It's a case where the always fun Claudette Colbert is better than her material, as are Rudy Vallee and several of the bit players, while Joel McCrea is practically faceless and undistinguished.Worth watching once, but I won't be taking up shelf space in my home with a copy of ""The Palm Beach Story.""

Things take another zany turn when Tom is chased by J.D.'s man-eating sister Princess Centimillia (Mary Astor).  Hilarious slapstick sequences and the rapier dialogue of Preston Sturges makes this film one of the greatest of classic Hollywood comedies.Claudette Colbert's performance as Gerry is easily one of her best, evoking fond memories of her Oscar-winning role in ""It Happened One Night"".  Joel McCrea, who spent most of his career idling in B-movie territory, is the perfect straight-man to Colbert's comedic whirlwind.

(For the record, I consider that the peak began in 1940 with The Great McGinty, ended in 1944 with Hail the Conquering Hero, and includes The Lady Eve [1941], Sullivan's Travels [1941], and The Miracle of Morgan's Creek [1944]. That's quite a roll for anybody!) The Palm Beach Story doesn't quite match up to his best work, but it still has a lot more going for it than at first it seems.McCrea (John Sullivan in Sullivan's Travels) stars as Tom Jeffers, an architect who doesn't make a lot of money, but has a big dream: to build his own airport. His wife, Gerry (Colbert), wants to support his dream ... by divorcing him so she can marry rich and give him money on the side. Her argument is that they don't love each other anymore, and all that is left is love and respect (their behavior towards each other says otherwise).Then the first implausible thing happens: he goes along with her idea. Posing as her brother (they look alike because everyone marries his/her own face), he will have approval over who his wife marries. On her way to Palm Beach to meet a millionaire, she meets one on the train, John D. ""Snoodles"" Hackensacker, III (Rudy Vallee, The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer), who falls for her is his own milquetoasty way. (Being Vallee, he even serenades her in one scene.) Snoodles also has a sister, who has been married five times and ""will marry anything."" She is played by Mary Astor (the femme fatale in The Maltese Falcon), whose saucy reputation is thoroughly covered in Kenneth Anger's tinsel-town expose, Hollywood Babylon.The Palm Beach Story doesn't come across as very original, but it has a lot of charm. McCrea and Colbert make an ideal couple, and you just know that they will end up together (just like in The Awful Truth, the original Mr. and Mrs. Smith [the only pure comedy directed by Alfred Hitchcock], Phffft!, and all the other loving-couple-tries-to-stay-apart-but-realizes-they-really-love-each-other films of that screwball subgenre). Astor plays her character as a mix of Angelica and Cornelia Bullock (Alice Brady and Gail Patrick, respectively) from My Man Godfrey, and her hanger-on, Toto (Sig Arno), resembles no one more than that film's Carlo (Mischa Auer). Of course, William Demarest, Franklin Pangborn, and Robert Greig show up in smaller roles to complete the full Sturges picture (the three were in a number of his films, always in memorable roles). My only real complaints with The Palm Beach Story are the slow pace and the fact that the happy ending requires such a ridiculous deus ex machina, but I can't help but admire Sturges for actually going through with it.",4,"Not Sturges' best, but still pretty great",1142380800,"03 15, 2006",2006,2822,"['film', 'featuring', 'Joel', 'McCrea', 'Claudette', 'Colbert', 'couple', 'seeking', 'out', 'new', 'life', 'partners', 'sake', 'other', 'came', 'middle', 'peak', 'writer/director', 'Preston', 'Sturges', 'career', 'record', 'consider', 'peak', 'began', '1940', 'Great', 'McGinty', 'ended', '1944', 'Hail', 'Conquering', 'Hero', 'Lady', 'Eve', '[', '1941', ']', 'Sullivan', 'Travels', '[', '1941', ']', 'Miracle', 'Morgan', 'Creek', '[', '1944', ']', 'quite', 'roll', 'anybody', 'Palm', 'Beach', 'Story', ""n't"", 'quite', 'match', 'up', 'best', 'work', 'still', 'lot', 'more', 'going', 'first', 'seems.McCrea', 'John', 'Sullivan', 'Sullivan', 'Travels', 'Tom', 'Jeffers', 'architect', 'who', ""n't"", 'make', 'lot', 'money', 'big', 'dream', 'build', 'own', 'airport', 'wife', 'Gerry', 'Colbert', 'support', 'dream', 'divorcing', 'can', 'marry', 'rich', 'give', 'money', 'side', 'argument', 'do', ""n't"", 'love', 'other', 'anymore', 'left', 'love', 'respect', 'behavior', 'towards', 'other', 'otherwise', '.Then', 'first', 'implausible', 'thing', 'happens', 'along', 'idea', 'Posing', 'brother', 'look', 'alike', 'everyone', 'marries', 'his/her', 'own', 'face', 'will', 'have', 'approval', 'who', 'wife', 'marries', 'way', 'Palm', 'Beach', 'meet', 'millionaire', 'one', 'train', 'John', 'D.', 'Snoodles', 'Hackensacker', 'III', 'Rudy', 'Vallee', 'Bachelor', 'Bobby-Soxer', 'who', 'own', 'milquetoasty', 'way', 'Being', 'Vallee', 'even', 'one', 'scene', 'Snoodles', 'also', 'sister', 'who', 'been', 'married', 'five', 'times', 'will', 'marry', 'anything', 'played', 'Mary', 'Astor', 'femme', 'fatale', 'Maltese', 'Falcon', 'saucy', 'reputation', 'thoroughly', 'covered', 'Kenneth', 'Anger', 'tinsel-town', 'expose', 'Hollywood', 'Babylon.The', 'Palm', 'Beach', 'Story', ""n't"", 'come', 'very', 'original', 'lot', 'charm', 'McCrea', 'Colbert', 'make', 'ideal', 'couple', 'just', 'know', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'together', 'just', 'Awful', 'Truth', 'original', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'only', 'pure', 'comedy', 'directed', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', ']', 'Phffft', 'other', 'loving-couple-tries-to-stay-apart-but-realizes-they-really-love-each-other', 'films', 'screwball', 'subgenre', 'Astor', 'character', 'mix', 'Angelica', 'Cornelia', 'Bullock', 'Alice', 'Brady', 'Gail', 'Patrick', 'respectively', 'Man', 'Godfrey', 'hanger-on', 'Toto', 'Sig', 'Arno', 'one', 'more', 'film', 'Carlo', 'Mischa', 'Auer', 'course', 'William', 'Demarest', 'Franklin', 'Pangborn', 'Robert', 'Greig', 'show', 'up', 'smaller', 'roles', 'complete', 'full', 'Sturges', 'picture', 'three', 'were', 'number', 'films', 'always', 'memorable', 'roles', 'only', 'real', 'complaints', 'Palm', 'Beach', 'Story', 'are', 'slow', 'pace', 'fact', 'happy', 'ending', 'ridiculous', 'deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'admire', 'Sturges', 'actually', 'going']",Palm Beach Story VHS

Is it a movie, like The Wedding Singer or American Pie or The Time Machine or A Room with a View, that I can watch over and over and over again and never really get tired of?In what might be Preston Sturges' best movie (though that's debatable), the Palm Beach Story is definitely one of those movies that you can watch over and over again. If you want to see really cute Veronica Lake in a comedy role, see Sullivan's Travels (though that movie gets slow and a bit depressing near the end, before it returns to happiness).A lot of previous reviewers mentioned the Ale and Quail Club, as if their scenes were a spotlight in the movie. Quite honestly, I thought the Ale and Quail club were annoying. Thank Goodness their antics didn't eat up too much movie time. The real show stealer for this movie was Rudy Vallee, who plays a stuffed suit with money to burn, with an eye on Claudette Colbert to burn the dough on. Vallee's very practical; very matter of fact, which makes his delivery so damn funny. When it comes time for the movie to introduce the sister of Vallee's character, who's pretty much the polar opposite of Vallee, you'll REALLY start rolling.Great comedies always have clever dialogue. This movie doesn't waver from that requirement. Colbert is classy and cute. Vallee is hilarious and pathetic. You love watching the characters and you can't help but care about all the characters, which is the mark of a great movie.  Slapstick comedy, clever dialogue, and romance. This movie is definitely a winner, and it belongs with your VHS collection.

205787,A3AFNUPOSK2QGV,6300185206,"Joe Kenney ""buttergun""","[3, 3]","A definite, certifiable classic.  Impressed with writer/director Preston Sturges's 1941 film ""Sullivan's Travels,"" Claudette Colbert - then at the height of her fame - told Sturges that she was interested in working with him.  In response Sturges wrote The Palm Beach Story for her, thus giving Colbert one of her most popular roles ever - a movie in its day that was, finally, as big a hit as her 1934 turn in ""It Happened One Night.""In a way Colbert's character here, Gerry Jeffers, is a twisted funhouse reflection of her character Eve Peabody from the 1939 classic ""Midnight"" (a movie, by the way, which did not receive the instant acclaim Palm Beach Story did, and only gathered it over the ensuing decades).  But whereas Eve Peabody was a social-climber only in that she scampered from one locale to the next, searching without realization for Mr. Perfect (who somehow turned out to be...Don Ameche!!), Gerry is a manipulative schemer who just wants a better life for herself.  She leaves her hardworking but financially-strapped husband (Joel McCrea, as good as ever) because she wants to live in opulence, opulence he can't provide.  So what that she loves him, and that he loves her?  Gerry leaves him anyway.  She wants the life he can't provide.  Indeed, the character is the most base Colbert ever played, right there alongside her turn as Empress Poppaea, from the 1932 DeMille extravaganza ""The Sign of the Cross.""  Only The Palm Beach Story is played as a comedy, and with her snappy banter and cute expressions, you never realize that Gerry's as soulless and calculative as Nero's empress.But anyway - this is a rip-roaring movie that doesn't let up from the opening to the ending credits.  Indeed, the opening credits themselves are a delight - a surreal, fast-paced montage of unexplained situations...a montage that goes unexplained throughout the course of the ensuing film, only to be rekindled at the very end, in one of the greatest ""a ha - so THAT'S what that was all about!"" moments in film history.  The entirety of The Palm Beach Story is like this.  While the Second World War rages (unmentioned) in Europe and Asia, the characters in this wacky film bumble about in a world ungrounded in reality.  The clues are everywhere - for example, what city in the world would buy, let alone build, Joel McCrea's ""steel hammock"" airstrip landing?  But this is just one example of the movie's irreverence.  Sturges excelled in madcappery; he could write witty barbs as good as Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder, but he also gelded the dialog with hijinks to match.  The Palm Beach Story is a spoof of the screwball comedies that were so popular at the time.  Whereas those movies featured unexpected and unexplained coincidences in an otherwise ""normal"" world, The Palm Beach Story is twisted to the core.  Twisted in a wonderful way.So, Gerry leaves husband Tom (McCrea) and bounds off for Palm Beach, Florida, where she can get a quickie divorce.  (How much simpler it is these days, when one can visit a simple website and do the same thing.)  Along the way she encounters a trainful of drunk, shotgun-wielding club-members, a mega-wealthy bachelor (Rudy Vallee) and his jet-setting sister (Mary Astor), and an incredibly annoying foreigner of uncertain background who speaks an uncertain language (Sig Arno).  And along the way she endures a host of baffling, surreal, and hilarious experiences.  At the same time husband Tom sets out after her - his ticket paid for by a wealthy octogenarian who has made his millions selling hot dogs, of course.  It all builds into a sequence of characters pretending to be someone they aren't, culminating in one of the most staggering, ""HUH?"" climaxes of all time.  The first time you watch this movie you'll be shaking your head and rubbing your eyes when the end credits roll, slackjawed by the unexpected ending - unexpected AND unexplained, that is, until you recall the dizzy flurry of those opening credits, ninety minutes ago.We should all be glad Colbert enjoyed ""Sullivan's Travels"" and let her opinions be known to Sturges.  If not, The Palm Beach Story likely wouldn't have happened; Sturges wrote the film specifically with Colbert in mind.  And she delivers in spades; the lady never, not even once, gave a bad performance.  She was always good, usually great, and here she's fantastic.  As mentioned, you don't even realize how heartless her character is, so delightful and personable is Colbert.  And yet Gerry Jeffers is the kind of woman who would giggle as she carved the heart out of your chest.  That Colbert made the character so likeable (indeed, you fall in love with her just as much as do McCrea and Vallee's characters) is just one more example of how gifted an actress Colbert was.But then, everyone's at the top of their game in The Palm Beach Story.  McCrea, fresh from ""Sullivan's Travels,"" is dashing and handsome; it's hard to believe this movie was made a decade after ""The Most Dangerous Game,"" as he looks nearly the same here.  Rudy Vallee excels as a mega-wealthy Rockefeller-type who regardless is as nave as a newborn.  And Mary Astor, as usual, turns in a delightful performance.  The rest of the cast is composed of the usual Sturges crew, a host of memorable faces and memorable characters.  Sturges himself - well, it goes without saying.  He was at the pinnacle of his powers, and it's incredible that he not only wrote such an entertaining piece of cinema, but that he directed it with such panache.The DVD presents a very nice package - both audio and video are sharp.  There isn't much grain and the picture appears to be restored.  Unfortunately there are no extras - no commentaries, no trailers.  But the film itself justifies the price of admission - buy it, watch it, watch it again.  Who knows?  Maybe on your tenth viewing you'll be able to figure out who's who in the opening credits, and maybe even discern the meaning behind those veiled looks the characters cast from one to another in the final shot of the film (slight spoiler warning: it's possible the wrong twin married the wrong twin!).",5,"The Palm Beach Story: Madcap, Surreal Classic",1260835200,"12 15,

It's a story of guys chasing gals and vice versa with nothing sacred or too serious.This film has some light moments and is evocative of a long past style. It brought back memories even though I was not even born in the era it portrayed. There is nothing overly memorable about the film but it was an enjoyable experience.

I find it better than his two most celebrated movies, Hail the Conquering Hero & Miracle of Morgan Creek. They were made a little later & were rah rah World War II movies, hence their popularity. Before Palm Beach was The Lady Eve in '41. Excellent acting & perhaps his best. Sullivan's Travels was right before Palm Beach in '42 & they are equally good. Both have the virtue of the steady influence of Joel McCrea as the star. In Palm Beach he is Tom. His wife Gerrie is played by Claudette Colbert. He is a broke dreamer with big ideas. She is hot to trot. Her plan is to divorce him & find a rich sugar daddy to finance his dreams. She feigns indifference & boards a train leaving for Florida. It seems that Preston Sturges could get away with a lot more in his movies than the censors might have allowed in the forties. There was plenty of sexual innuendo, adult content & satire attacking wealth in this one. Adultry was implied. First he was subtle. So subtle that this movie has a family friendly air about it. More important he always incorporated a lengthy, absurd, ridiculous comedy scene. It would be madcap, funny, slapstick & even silly. These scenes must have distracted stupid censors. The Ale & Quail Club was a fraternity of old, rich guys. They were on convention from New York to Florida in a party car of a the train. They assisted Gerrie who was broke & without any clothes. The drunken fools were so out of control that their car is detached from the train enroute. Gerrie has escaped to the pullman sleeper & meets the fabulously wealthy John Hackensack III played by heart-throb crooner of the 20's, Rudy Vallee. He's lower she's upper but they get to know each other. You know he's going to break out in song sometime during the movie. By the time they get to Jacksonville & his yacht he's in love. They are met by Hackensack's sister Centimitia, played by Mary Astor. She is a predator & has her heart set on Tom who has persued Gerrie down to Palm Beach. The ending is a bit of a cop-out. But Struges uses all the latitude he is given to good use.",4,A review for fans of Preston Stuges movies.

205791,A2OD45RK9UM55F,6300185206,Jonathan Rimorin,"[4, 8]","I saw this movie years ago and remembered it with affection as an unfailing pick-me-up. I've just seen it for the 2nd time on telly and wrote my review. In my enthusiasm I neglected to avoid spoilers, so for those who haven't seen this screwball masterpiece, please see the movie first and then read my review! Regardless of what you may think of me, you will not be disappointed by this movie. I dare you not to be charmed.One of Preston Sturges four or five masterpieces, and IMHO his most masterly piece. The beautiful Geraldine (Claudette Colbert) and Tom Jeffers (Joel McCrea) are your (seemingly) normal everyday working-class married couple in financial straits; Tom  needs some cash to develop his invention, a suspension-airport-tennis-racket, but this being 1942 and venture capital more difficult to raise in those days, Geraldine helps her husband and does the next sensible thing, deciding to divorce Tom, marry someone rich, and then invest in Tom's project. She hies herself to Palm Beach, touted to her by a helpful cab driver as the second most popular divorce resort next to Reno, &quot;but for my money Palm Beach is your best bet for this time of year, you got your beaches, you got your hotels.&quot; Tom for some reason disagrees with her plan, valuing their marriage over his fortune, and hies himself Palm Beach-ward to fend off his divorce-minded wife. But Gerry, who's left her husband without taking any money, sells herself to a band of gun-toting ale-drinking millionaires in exchange for a train passage, meets another multimillionaire by repeatedly grinding his pince-nez into his face with her foot (it's all right, he carries an inexhaustible supply of them) and becomes adopted by her smitten mutlimillionaire and his sister the Duchess or Princess Centimellia (oh, it's Princess, she divorced the Duke two husbands ago, or was it three?). This becomes complicated when Tom shows in Palm Beach and is taken up by the Princess in the guise of Gerry's brother, one Captain McGlue (&quot;Captain of what? The Boy Scouts?&quot; Tom shrieks. &quot;And why is my name McGLUE?!&quot;) and the multimillionaire, who goes by the nickname Snooty, attempts to befriend him, all the while imprecating Gerry's dastardly soon-to-be-ex-husband.The plot, as you can see, is another of Sturge's marvelously convoluted structures, and is rife throughout with much of his trademark one-liners (&quot;It is the tragedy of this world that the men most in need of a beating are always enormous&quot;; &quot;Nothing is forever, dear. Except Roosevelt.&quot;) and dazzling design. What makes this concoction the creamiest of Sturge's crop are the wonderful performances; McCrea's stolidness doesn't trip him up as it did in the coda of &quot;Sullivan's Travels,&quot; and actually gives his Tom Jeffers a warm growly dog quality I find endearing. Mary Astor perfects her chatterbox heiress performance in this film. Rude Vallee is a revelation as the persnickety Snooty, abandoning his teenybopper-crooner fame to play the role of a parsimonious googolplexaire falling disastrously in love.And Claudette Colbert, wow. Barbara Stanwyck may be more sexy in &quot;The Lady Eve,&quot; Veronica Lake more mysterious and stylish in &quot;Sullivan's Travels,&quot; but Claudette Colbert.... wow.That said, I took a star off because of the sequences of the drunken millionaire's gun club and the black railroad servicemen. I know that the film was made in 1942 and one should make allowances, but the scene where the millionaires are shooting randomly around the train, forcing the black bartender to dance around their bullets made me wince. It was funny, but too sadistic for our sensitivities 50 years later. This goes too for the extended scene where the only joke is that the (black) train attendant continously pronounces &quot;yacht&quot; as &quot;yachit.&quot;The film's abrupt happy ending was an out-of-left-field delight, and of course made me watch the beginning credit sequence again. I'm not altogether sure what happens there in the beginning, does anyone out there have any ideas?",4,"A gem!!

She loves her husband, Tom Jeffers (Joel McCrea) but doesn't like being poor and he is unwilling to pimp her innocent feminine wiles. The solution? Leaving her husband for Palm Beach to file for a divorce with nothing more than the clothes on her back, she becomes one of the world's best dressed women before she can even set foot in the divorce captiol of the day. (If you know anything about Colbert's movies, you realize she can wear some stunning outfits.) Her gallant husband heads her off to convince her how irrational she is but is surprised to find her stepping off a yacht with a 1940's counterpart to Bill Gates, John D. Hackensacker III (Rudy Vallee). So as not to foil her apparently successful plans, she introduces Tom as her brother -- which makes him an all-the-more attractive flavor of the week to a wealthy man's excentric sister, Princess Centimillia (Mary Astor).

205796,A42QN9MM6LKKM,6300185206,Lee in S.F.,"[1, 1]","All the other reviews here currently focus on the purchase of a boxed set of films by the director of this movie.  My comments concern my experience of watching this particular movie only, through Amazon Prime.  In short, it was a kick!A New York couple who've been married for several years struggle financially, with the husband being more preoccupied with bringing his fantastic ideas to life, than with producing income.  We learn this through the dialog.  Even so, however, the apartment where the couple lives is elegant and well-appointed, and both members of this couple  dress well.  So there is no real evidence of painful poverty which might mar the light-hearted tone.Somewhat like Lucy (of ""I Love Lucy"") might have done, the wife comes up with a screwball scheme to improve their financial standing.  However, this wife is a lot more savvy and sophisticated than Lucy ever was (and also more fashionable!).  It's a plan so absurd, of course, it's doomed from the start.  Still, she pursues it with vigor, while her exasperated husband tries to run interference.Her escapades take them from New York to Palm Beach.  Despite having no funds, she makes her way there just as she'd planned: she trades upon her beauty to get wealthy men to pay her expenses.  I don't know if the success of her methods was meant as satire, but I was glad to take it as such!  And I also very much appreciated that while the screenwriter shows how she pulls this off, he doesn't cheapen or degrade her.  Rather, she clearly considers the whole thing to be a lark, and so do the men who're happy to help her out.  (I wouldn't wish for women to return to their secondary status at the time this movie was made.  Nevertheless, the movie's depiction of an era when a female easily held her public space, and wasn't expected to deliver sex as a matter of course, was innocent and refreshing.)The writing is always clever, with Colbert carrying the entire movie with her witticisms.  She does a terrific job, but is also admirably supported by her screen husband, and by her later suitor.  All the parts for the station and train segment were well-cast and well-played, also.  However, the minor role of the man who spoke a language no one could understand, seemed like a good ""idea"" for humor, but one which never quite materialized.  Also, the brash socialite was to me more annoying than comedic.  But since these two characters weren't on screen a lot, their presence was more of a minor nuisance than a story impediment.The brisk pace kept my attention well all the way through.  In fact, as the movie began its wrap-up, I found myself wishing that it could have lasted longer.  Due to the crazy premise, the viewer knows from the beginning what the outcome will be.  So all the fun is had in watching the antics which achieve that end.The set-up reminded me of other comedies of that general era (efforts which may have borrowed from these early movie comedies).  I've already mentioned that the movie reminded me of how ""I Love Lucy"" plots were set up, with a premise so absurd that just about anything could happen.  I was also reminded of George and Gracie, and their stage marriage.  The couple in this movie, like George and Gracie, obviously cared very much about one another, and both couples seemed delightfully compatible.

205797,A3MLO4GAD2O9DL,6300185206,"LGwriter ""SharpWitGuy""","[5, 6]","THE first Hollywood auteur--i.e., writer-director--Preston Sturges here gives us one of his all-time classics that, for my money, is better than Sullivan's Travels and easily the equal of The Lady Eve.  It's pretty amazing to see not one but TWO smart, sophisticated women on the make--Claudette Colbert as a wife fed up with her husband's penury, and Mary Astor as the sister of the goofy millionaire Colbert meets and is, you should pardon the expression, wooed by.Rudy Vallee, as the mllionaire, also has his not-as-wealthy doppelganger in Joel McCrea, Colbert's somewhat bumbling designer husband who's trying to get a $99,000 project off the ground (actually, onto the ground--it's a huge, ridiculous metal-net for airplanes to land on).  Just as both women have tongues sharper than stainless steel razors honed with eager whetstones, so too do both men have brains that can't quite follow the women's spitfire patter and instead of paying close attention, resort to what Sturges' men usually do--follow instead their male instincts, which means say what they gotta say and do what they gotta do.Sturges' forte is the uncanny ability to juxtapose selfishness with so much whimsy and foible-ridden thinking it's impossible not to laugh.  Women are selfish in one way, men in another.  But both of them ARE selfish, and therein lies the rub (as it were)--that is, the famous battle of the sexes.  Colbert (Gerry Jeffers) wants a divorce from McCrea (Tom Jeffers) because of his inability to bring in the bacon and doesn't mind it at all when millionaire Vallee (John Hackensacker--gee, I wonder where that name came from...) buys her all kinds of clothes and stuff.Obviously one of the major inspirations for, among many others, the Coen brothers (e.g., The Hudsucker Proxy), Sturges was a genius for his time, so far ahead of anybody else it boggles the mind. Listen to Colbert deliver a jaw-dropping speech on sex--meaning, not the physical act, but the power of a woman to divert a man. The use of the word ""sex"" to mean that--in fact, the use of the word itself--was without question a milestone (or is that millstone) for 1942, the year of this film.Gerry calls Tom Captain McGloo when she's introducing him to Hackensacker to assure the latter that Tom is not really her husband at all but her brother.  Mr. H. introduces Tom to her sister Centimilia (Mary Astor) so the foursome--a real brother and sister, and a fake duo of the same ""persuasion""--gaily tramp off together to the nearest hotel.The amazing scene on the train with the Ale and Quail Club has be seen to be believed, again so far ahead of its time it's almsot a shock.How to fuse satire, wit, and superior intelligence in a single film?

Jerry (Claudette Colbert) runs away from engineer husband Tom (Joel McCrea) after feeling she's in the way of his success and tired of being poor. The Wienie King (don't ask) gives her $700. She spends it and flees to Palm Beach for a divorce with no money and no clothes. On the train, after the Ale & Quail Club pay her fare (don't ask), she is hounded by the rowdy (and I mean ROWDY) bunch until the conductor is forced to abandon the car! Then she steps on and  meets ""Snoodles"" Hackensacker (Rudy Valee) a stiff as starch but charming multimillionaire who buys her clothes and lets her stay at his Palm Beach mansion with his husband hunting sister (Mary Astor) and her ""guest"" a bizarre French (?) kook who's always falling down. Then Tom shows up (after also meeting the Wienie King) and then everything gets even crazier. Alternately funny, romantic, sexy (oh yes) and surreal, this overlooked gem is packed with rapid fire dialogue, double entendres and just plain lunacy. ""Palm Beach Story"" must have been very adult for the time (1942) because it still tickles in the right places. Colbert's costumes are stunning and she is delightful as Jerry.

So, being in Israel in such dramatic times (my girlfriend is going to leave me) I started from the comedies, the ones I know will be great and will warm my heart.  And ""The Palm Beach Story"" is brilliant, of course.  How many times do you though about the rampant materialism that pervades relationships in North America?  How many times did you see that subject treated in cinema or television?  Not many, because love and dating is one of the great myths of the ""American Dream"", that maintains people subjugated and content.  Not anymore, and we have Sturges to thank for that.  His characters are so honest, so open and direct about why we do the thinks we do that listening to them is like watching yourself at the mirror without self-justifications.  So men want women to be servile and women want men to be providers.  At least some of them.  In fact enough of them to make the others seem like a rarity.  The lunacy moments of the film are expertly crafted and the supposedly controversial end is nothing but natural to this kind of social satire (with the exception of Joe Dante's ""The Second Civil War"", of course).

It was absolutely hysterical. The cast is pitch-perfect. But what makes it all work is that fast repartee between the actors that you only see in movies from the 30's and 40's. Think ""My Man Godfrey' with Powell and Lombard and its terrific supporting cast. It's the same thing with this movie. It's all done perfectly. I rolled on the floor when the scenes of the rich deaf ""Weeni King"" hitting on Claudette Colbert came on.  I nearly died laughing during the drunken Gun Club scene on the train. And in a stroke of casting genius, director Preston Sturges selected Rudy Vallee and Mary Astor for co-staring roles. And they utterly steal the movie.  As  brother and sister, third generation millionaires ( Vallee is oil fortune heir John D. Hackensakker III. Get it??) they move about their world of luxury in a ditzy alternative reality.  Astor is in a constant state between marriages and divorces with worthless European counts, but no less man hungry. (She utters the line of the movie with 'Nothing is permanent anymore darling except Roosevelt').  Vallee delivers his lines with breezy comic seriousness made all the more hysterical by his expressions and incomprehensible logic. Now I know where the producers of the 1960's TV show 'Gilligan's Island' got the idea for millionaire Thurston Howell III played by Jim Backus.If you haven't seen this movie yet, don't wait.

I suppose the country needed this kind of light hearted entertainment, just as it did during the depression era.  Right now I find it still good medicine as we face the biggest economic downturn since the 30's and wars are erupting everywhere.  The outrageousness of the wonderful female lead, played by the beautiful Claudette Colbert is  refreshingly politically incorrect.  She knows that a good looking ""girl"" with long legs can get what she wants by her female charms and isn't afraid to use them.  She can't cook or sew but is ravishing and not afraid to accept the gifts of the many men who offer them.  Still, she is good hearted and pure in her love for her big, strong, handsome, hunky man.This isn't my favorite Sturges film but it's still very good.  He manages screwball comedy without going over the top, which was probably not an easy thing to do.  All of the characters are likeable, too, which makes the film easy to watch.  The Rudy Vallee character could have been played as dreadful but he was quite lovely. His ""Goodnight Sweetheart"" serenade is almost worth the price of the film.  Likewise, his much married sister, played by Mary Astor, was so fun loving and light hearted that you had to like her.  There was no malice anywhere!Gordon Macrae, who shone so brightly in Sullivan's Travels is a little dull here but the rest of the cast makes up for it.  Travelling by train seems delightfully exotic to us these days.  The Fifth Avenue apartment and the Palm Beach house are all wonderfully decorated.  Remember dressing tables with round mirrors?

While the credits are running, we see onscreen an entire prequel somehow involving two sets of identical twins (one set played by Joel McCrea and the other by Claudette Colbert).Preston Sturges is not the best director the United States has ever produced, but he unquestionably enjoyed the finest five year period of any director we have ever seen.  From 1940 until 1945, Preston Sturges enjoyed a run of amazingly crafted comedy masterpieces that by themselves place him on any list of the essential directors.  In the late 1930s, Sturges built a name for himself by penning a number of first rate comedy scripts, including the classic EASY LIVING as well as REMEMBER THE NIGHT.  Paramount gave him a shot at directing, and he responded with films like THE GREAT McGINTY, CHRISTMAS IN JULY, the great THE LADY EVE, SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS, THE PALM BEACH STORY, THE MIRACLE OF MORGAN'S CREEK, and HAIL THE CONQUERING HERO.  But then, suddenly and without warning, his genius deserted him.But this is one of the best of his best.

In SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS, he had a great railroad yard sequence in which an old tramp was killed by a streamliner, and later Joel McCrea and Veronica Lake spent much time in freightcars.  Here, Sturges again picked out a railroad car - a private Pullman to Florida - for a wild and slapstick farce.  Claudette Colbert, fleeing from her husband in New York, finds herself in Pennsylvania Station without a cent.  Here she is taken in tow by the millionaire members of the Ale &amp; Quail Club - who are going south for their annual shoot-'em up and drink-em'-down vacation.  What happens on the train is one of the funniest scenes in vintage comedy.  Rudy Vallee plays the world's richest  man who believes that it's un-American to give more than a 10-cent tip; he was praised by the critics for this performance because he showed he could do more than croon the Maine STEIN SONG, and act ineptly as he did in his early talkies.  As John D. Hackensacker III, Vallee (playing straight comedy) rescues Claudette from the pyrotechnics of the Ale &amp; Quail Club and takes her to Palm Beach on his yacht.

205808,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,6300185206,Simon Davis,"[5, 6]","Rarely have I enjoyed a screw ball comedy more than Preston Sturges's classic look at the lives of the idle rich and those that aspire to be that way in 1942's ""The Palm Beach Story"". Taking over the reins as both writer and director here Sturges has produced a gem which came hot on the heels of his classic ""The Lady Eve"" of the previous year.This gem of a feature boasts total excellence in all areas, sparkling performances from a top notch cast, superb writing, delicious one liners delivered with relish, rapid fire direction and a beautiful overall look to the proceedings. Indeed so rapid is the pace of this film that it almost requires repeated viewings to be able to fully appreciate the genius of the comic situations and dialogue.To describle the plotline as being involved and complex is a definite understatement. Convoluted in an endearing way is the best way to describe it. It tells the story of young married couple Tom and Geraldine ""Gerry"" Jefferswho are struggling financially as Tom is an inventor who has difficulty in getting his original ideas to sell. Gerry being of a harder nature is fed up with being poor and when they are in danger of being evicted from their apartment Gerry decides to do the only thing that a girl like her knows; divorce Tom and find herself a rich husband who can keep her in the style she would like to become used to, while also helping Tom to obtain the financing for his new airport project. What develops from this point onwards adds up to one crazy comic situation after another. Gerry firstly encounters the unforgettable ""Wienie King"" (Robert Dudley in an absolutely scene stealing performance) an elderly gentleman who is hard of hearing and who gives Gerry a stack of money to get her out of her troubles because he likes her. Gerry heads for Palm Beach as that is ""the second best place to get a divorce"" according to the Taxi driver! What happens along the way is what classic comedies are made of as Gerry finds herself firstly ""adapted"" by the crazy members of a hunting club, the Ale and Quail Club that are travelling on the same train and who in a drunken state proceed to take over the train causing complete chaos for all concerned including the terrified barman who sees his whole workplace demolished around him. To escape them Gerry then slips into the sleeping compartment area where she then encounters John D. Hackensacker 111 (Rudy Vallee in a non crooner role) who just turns out to be one of the richest men in America and predictably falls instantly for Gerry. Once in Palm Beach pursued by an angry Tom Gerry is thrown into a whirlwind of deception and comic misunderstandings as she encounters the amazingly eccentric Countess Centimillia (Mary Astor in one of her most hilarious roles ever)  John's man hungry, much married sister who takes an instant shine to Tom who is introduced to her as Gerry's brother Captain McGlue!! The comic goings one between the 4 main leads are a sight to behold and eventually end up with each person pairing off with the most suitable partner, Gerry with Tom, the Countess with Tom's identical brother and John with Gerry's twin sister!! Total madness indeed but so delightfully done that it almost takes on a logic of it's own!Rarely have the cast here been in finer form. Under Sturges's sure direction each of them are outstanding. Claudette Colbert, a favourite actress of mine has rarely been better than here and she can say more with a sideways glance or a twinkle of her eyethan most actresses could do with 5 pages of dialogue. Her Geraldine is both calculating and refreshingly practical and cool headed in the bizzare situations she finds herself. Her scenes with the Ale and Quail club members are brilliant and real rib ticklers as her normally refined way of performing is put to the test with these loud and over the top performers. Joel  McCrea has never been better than in his playing here as the harried husband who goes on a mad chase to reclaim his wife. His reactions to be dubbed ""Captain McGlue"" are priceless and his entanglement with the man hungry Countess who quickly earmarks him as her next husband will make you laugh out loud. Mary Astor, always an interesting actress literally steals the show as the Countess with her rapid hundred words to the minute type of delivery. Some of the most hilarious lines in the film belong to her and she delivers them with relish for example in a retort to Tom about the length of all her marriages she states ""nothing is forever....except Roosevelt!!"" In her memoirs Astor stated how she did not enjoy working for Preston Sturges in ""The Palm Beach Story"" and felt she never really got her characterisation right in this film. Interesting really as I think she has never been better than here and is the comic centre of the whole crazy proceedings with  her playing. Rudy Vallee as the hapless millionaire is also a revelation in his playing of the fumbling man besotted with the much more world wise Geraldine. His different style of playing contrasts beautifully with the more over the top playing of Mary Astor. His scenes on the train with Colbert are classic where she continues to break his sets of glasses as he tries to give her a boost up into the top bunk of the sleeping compartment.""The Palm Beach Story"" is what classic screwball comedy is all about.The pace of the film is like a rocket and the one liners which hold many perceptive views on the rich and on our money consious society are a clever reflection of societies values at the time. Like all Sturges vechicles under the comic nonsense there is actually alot being said that can be applied to any age or time. Enjoy ""The Palm Beach Story"" and definately treat yourself to repeat viewings of this 1942 masterpiece as you will, like me, find new things to admire, laugh at, and reflect on with each visit.",5,Preston Sturges Screwball Classic Delight,1036540800,"11 6, 2002",2002,5861,"['Rarely', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'screw', 'ball', 'comedy', 'more', 'Preston', 'Sturges', 'classic', 'look',

And those people include the movie's audience.The movie begins with a whirlwind exposition sequence which explains absolutely nothing. It's Sturges' nose-thumbing at movies which have nothing *but* exposition. He seems to be saying, ""Must we explain everything from the get-go? Have some patience on this trip, and I'll get you there.""Soon enough, we meet Tom (Joel McCrea), a frustrated construction designer, and Jerry (Claudette Colbert), his equally frustrated wife. They live in a posh apartment but are constantly dodging bill collectors, until Jerry's chance run-in with a meat mogul known as ""The Weenie King."" (You think that's flouting the censors? Wait until you see Sturges's ""The Miracle of Morgan's Creek"" [1944].) When the Weenie King hears of Jerry's financial plight, he gives her a wad of money just because she's so darned cute. (Once you see Claudette Colbert, this will seem a bit more plausible.)Far from feeling relieved, Tom is displeased that Jerry solved their financial woes with only a little flirting. Jerry counters that everything in life is ""about sex"" (Note to censors: Flout-flout), and eventually she leaves Tom and sets out on her own, solely to prove that she can get whatever she needs in life just by being a woman.It's never shown whether Jerry proves this to herself or not. But along the way, she meets some memorable characters: the Ale and Quail Club (headed by Sturges veteran William Demarest); a millionairess (delightful Mary Astor) and her foreign-speaking boyfriend; and a soft-spoken yachtsman (Rudy Vallee), who falls for Jerry even after she accidentally breaks all of his pairs of glasses. All of these people love to talk, and Sturges obliges them with enough epigrams for a New Year's bash.And for those who think Sturges couldn't direct as well as he wrote, I recommend the scene where a tipsy Tom and Jerry discuss their impending divorce. The scene begins with Tom trying to unzip the back of Jerry's dress for her, and it ends as one of the swooniest love scenes it has ever been my pleasure to witness.And just when you think the movie has run out of steam, Sturges pulls a happy ending out of his hat that has you laughing through the closing credits.

205810,AK61LQI92GTCH,6300185206,"Steven Hellerstedt ""SH""","[45, 46]","Okay, this is a work of genius.  Preston Sturges wrote and directed THE PALM BEACH STORY, one of the best screwball comedies ever, made (1942) when the they weren't making many madcap comedies anymore.  At least not the type that appealed to adult sensibilities.  Like most screwball comedies it's a story of two slightly mismatched lovers, here caught in the fourth year of their marriage.  Joel McCrea plays Tom Jeffers, an inventor and builder who's having difficulties making a go of it.  Claudette Colbert is his wife Geraldine, a beautiful woman who can't cook or sew and by now feels she's become a bit of a `milestone' to her husband.  So it's off to Palm Beach, where she can obtain a divorce, marry a wealthy man and get the $90,000 her husband needs to build his skyline airport.  You see, she still loves him, and he still loves her....The raw materials of comedy are also those of melodrama and tragedy.  A story of love imperiled by impending poverty can be taken down Heartbreak Road, but THE PALM BEACH STORY is filled with more delightful oddballs and surreal situations than any other movie I can think of, beginning with the Colbert character, who makes any number of odd decisions based on the `logic of the situation.'  Problems begin when the `Wienie King' appears. He's a little old man in an oversized coat and hat who's a bit hard of hearing and a bit gruff of manner, wonderfully played by veteran character actor Robert Dudley.  Generous of nature and a fount of common-sensical wisdom beneath his crust, the Wienie King's act of largesse early on in the film starts the jealously and resentment ball rolling.  Like all the secondary characters in this one, though, he's more angel than devil, and his generosity will pay off in the end.  And, again like most of the minor characters, he gets more laughs than Colbert or McCrea, who more - much more, in the case of McCrea - or less play it straight while the comedy froths about them.  Dudley isn't the only funny character, either.  There's the Ale and Quail Club members who adopt Colbert as a mascot for a spell, and Sig Arno as a strange foreigner, language spoken and country of origin unknown, who plays gigolo to Mary Astor's Princess Centimillia.  Astor's man-hungry princess is the sister of John D. Hackensacker III, son of the son of an oil baron and played to comic perfection by Rudy Vallee.  It's in this fizzy sea of absurd to surreal characters that THE PALM BEACH STORY tells its tale of love triumphant.What can you say about a comedy that still makes you laugh even though you've watched it a zillion times?  Colbert is beautiful, McCrea is rock steady, and Vallee is a comic revelation.  This one still breezes by every time I watch it.  The highest recommendation for what's, in my opinion, one of the best comedies ever made.  The print's in okay condition and the dvd offers no extras.",5,The Palm Beach Story,1122163200,"07 24, 2005",2005,2886,"['Okay', 'work', 'genius', 'Preston', 'Sturges', 'wrote', 'directed', 'THE', 'PALM', 'BEACH', 'STORY', 'one', 'best', 'screwball', 'comedies', 'ever', 'made', '1942', 'when', 'were', ""n't"", 'making', 'many', 'madcap', 'comedies', 'anymore', 'least', 'not', 'type', 'appealed', 'adult', 'sensibilities', 'most', 'screwball', 'comedies', 'story', 'two', 'slightly', 'mismatched', 'lovers', 'here', 'caught', 'fourth', 'year', 'marriage', 'Joel', 'McCrea', 'Tom', 'Jeffers', 'inventor', 'builder', 'who', 'having', 'difficulties', 'making', 'go', 'Claudette', 'Colbert', 'wife', 'Geraldine', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'cook', 'sew', 'now', 'become', 'bit', 'milestone', 'husband', 'Palm', 'Beach', 'where', 'can', 'obtain', 'divorce', 'marry', 'wealthy', 'man', 'get', '90,000', 'husband', 'build', 'skyline', 'airport', 'see', 'still', 'still', '.The', 'raw', 'materials', 'comedy', 'are', 'also', 'melodrama', 'tragedy', 'story', 'love', 'imperiled', 'impending', 'poverty', 'can', 'be', 'taken', 'down', 'Heartbreak', 'Road', 'THE', 'PALM', 'BEACH', 'STORY', 'filled', 'more', 'delightful', 'oddballs', 'surreal', 'situations', 'other', 'movie', 'can', 'think', 'beginning', 'Colbert', 'character', 'who', 'number', 'odd', 'decisions', 'based', 'logic', 'situation', 'Problems', 'begin', 'when', 'Wienie', 'King', 'little', 'old', 'man', 'oversized', 'coat', 'hat', 'who', 'bit', 'hard', 'hearing', 'bit', 'gruff', 'manner', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'veteran', 'character', 'actor', 'Robert', 'Dudley', 'Generous', 'nature', 'fount', 'common-sensical', 'wisdom', 'crust', 'Wienie', 'King', 'act', 'largesse', 'early', 'film', 'jealously', 'resentment', 'ball', 'rolling', 'secondary', 'characters', 'one', 'though', 'more', 'angel', 'devil', 'generosity', 'will', 'pay', 'off', 'end', 'again', 'most', 'minor', 'characters', 'more', 'laughs', 'Colbert', 'McCrea', 'who', 'more', 'much', 'more', 'case', 'McCrea', 'less', 'straight', 'comedy', 'froths', 'Dudley', ""n't"", 'only', 'funny', 'character', 'either', 'Ale', 'Quail', 'Club', 'members', 'who', 'adopt', 'Colbert', 'mascot', 'spell', 'Sig', 'Arno', 'strange', 'foreigner', 'language', 'spoken', 'country', 'origin', 'unknown', 'who', 'gigolo', 'Mary', 'Astor', 'Princess', 'Centimillia', 'Astor', 'man-hungry', 'princess', 'sister', 'John', 'D.', 'Hackensacker', 'III', 'son', 'son', 'oil', 'baron', 'played', 'comic', 'perfection', 'Rudy', 'Vallee', 'fizzy', 'sea', 'absurd', 'surreal', 'characters', 'THE', 'PALM', 'BEACH', 'STORY', 'tale', 'love', 'can', 'say', 'comedy', 'still', 'laugh', 'even', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'zillion', 'times', 'Colbert', 'beautiful', 'McCrea', 'rock', 'steady', 'Vallee', 'comic', 'revelation', 'one', 'still', 'breezes', 'time', 'watch', 'highest', 'recommendation', 'what', 'opinion', 'one', 'best', 'comedies', 'ever', 'made', 'print', 'okay', 'condition', 'dvd', 'extras']",Palm Beach Story VHS

I generally find farces boring after about an hour, but the cast kept this fast-paced film interesting.
