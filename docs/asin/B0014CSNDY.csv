I believe what the Yoga session here is for someone who has not advanced into this style, or more like the style of Shiva Rea, who has several different yoga style DVDs.This DVD instruction is set up in segments, which indicate to the beginner that you can be selective on what you might want to focus on.  It is a lengthy program, over 70 minutes, much to much for a beginner.  What the beginner can do is  workout to a chapter segment at a time.  The poses move fast and you must be very flexible already!What is beautiful is the setting and the soft unobtrusive music.  An expert would be safe without the instruction.  If you choose to listen to the music while instruction, keep in mind that instruction moves quickly also.  Language may be unfamiliar to a beginner.  And, what I also like is that the poses are doable, without any extremely difficult poses, but again, you must be somewhat flexible.  And, be flexible enough to poke your head various challenging ways, to SEE the instruction.I am not a yoga person, per se, but I do it most for the stretching aspects.  Shiva Rea offers various styles of flow yoga DVDs.  Try theYoga Journal: Shiva Rea - Free Flow Vinyasaor one I like, because of the dance movements,Shiva Rea - Yoga Trance Dance....

1146033,A14JBDSWKPKTZA,B0014CSNDY,"Bob Feeser ""MillCrafters.com""","[1, 1]","I am more of a Yoga fan then I am an active practitioner. My fitness room is nearing completion, complete with a DVD playing PC that I can pump into the ceiling mounted TV. So I have been acquiring some Yoga DVDs in order to actually get into the practice. Weight lifting and running are more my forte, but I realize that blending that with Yoga for flexibility is the important 3rd part of the equation. So for expert commentary on Yoga, you will have to look elsewhere, but I hope that I can be helpful to others, who also are Yoga beginners.First off the idea of flow Yoga attracted me. I am an avid woodworker, and when I get into flow, everything starts to come together very efficiently. My mind and body/motions become one. Without distractions my best work is done in that state of mind. Much has been written on the subject of ""flow"". Shiva Rea starts out the DVD with a walk on the beach in Hawaii, where this DVD is filmed, and says the following words about flow.""Flow is the natural state of Yoga that we've known since birth. From artists to athletes, the state of flow is defined as the ability to move freely, in an unbroken stream of awareness, uniting your mind, body, and breath, with your creative intelligence. The essence of this program is to support that state of flow in your body, and life through Yoga.""This DVD has a unique feature; you have 2 music options. You can play the music only as a background to your own routine, or you can play the music with the video instruction, including the voice.There is some beautiful footage of the surf, winds, birds, and waves with appealing music playing in the background.For the novice, some of the poses she gets into may be a bit of a stretch.( No pun intended :-) Nevertheless, her fluidity and ease will inspire you.The instructional part of the DVD is in 4 sections, including foundation flow with some breathing exercises, beginning backbend, relaxing and flexibility, and finally the beginners standing pose flow.Like I said I am not an expert on Yoga, but I have several DVD's and this one is done expertly, with excellent video, audio, and appealing background, and honestly, I do feel inspired to begin to practice after seeing this one.

This DVD moves quickly, but you do each set multiple times (as is standard in vinyasa flow). My entire body was sore after this workout. In fact, the first time I did this DVD I absolutely had to take breaks because my arms, legs, and core were shaking. Mind you, I am an avid long-distance runner and am in pretty good shape. From that moment on I was hooked. It's fairly tradition, but the instructions Shiva Rea gives are so amazing. She explains moves in a manner that allow me to open up to them in entirely new ways. The background on this entire video is all filmed on location and it is just breath-taking. I have watched this DVD just to relax after work before, not even doing the yoga set itself.

1146035,A1KEK09ZA6J9P8,B0014CSNDY,Colleen M. Schneider,"[5, 6]","In all types of yoga, the key to achieving the maximum benefit is to learn to breathe correctly.  Sounds silly, I know, ""in and out"", what's hard about that?  Well, amazingly enough, we go through most days breathing in a shallow manner and not feeling what it truly feels like to breathe deeply and properly.Yoga is part of my regular fitness regime, although I have limited exposure to vinyasa (or ""flow"") yoga.  I currently do Ashtanga (or ""power"") yoga which concentrates on building strength and stamina and is more ""athletic"".  Vinyasa basically translated is ""breath-synchronized"" yoga, and the instructor tells you as you flow through the poses when to inhale and exhale.  Achieving the correct breathing pattern is key to the poses.I found Shiva Rea to be a very good instructor.  Cueing was well done, she is relaxed and the flow is graceful.  She gives you different variations on some of the poses so that you can choose the one that best suits your ability.  I found this practice to be both beautiful and rejuvinating.  After a stressful day, this is just the ticket to get back into a peaceful, more centered state of mind.The photography is beautiful and is filmed on the island of Kauii, including waterfalls, sunsets, and lush areas where Shiva's mat is surrounded by flowers and low torches.  Everything about this dvd is relaxing.The music is soft and meditative and flows beautifully along with the asanas (poses).You will leave this workout feeling renewed, more flexible and in a calmer, more peaceful state of mind.This is an excellent addition to your yoga practice regardless of your level of experience, as some days even those who practice more strenuous versions of yoga need a more gentle practice on some days.I would highly recommend Shiva's Flow Yoga DVD and would definitely seek out other dvd's that she has created.",5,the key is in the breathing....,1209254400,"04 27, 2008",2008,1851,"['types', 'yoga', 'key', 'achieving', 'maximum', 'benefit', 'learn', 'breathe', 'correctly', 'Sounds', 'silly', 'know', 'what', 'hard', 'Well', 'amazingly', 'enough', 'go', 'most', 'days', 'breathing', 'shallow', 'manner', 'not', 'feeling', 'what', 'truly', 'breathe', 'deeply', 'properly.Yoga', 'part', 'regular', 'fitness', 'regime', 'have', 'limited', 'exposure', 'vinyasa', 'flow', 'yoga', 'currently', 'do', 'Ashtanga', 'power', 'yoga', 'building', 'strength', 'stamina', 'more', 'athletic', 'Vinyasa', 'basically', 'translated', 'breath-synchronized', 'yoga', 'instructor', 'flow', 'poses', 'when', 'inhale', 'exhale', 'Achieving', 'correct', 'breathing', 'pattern', 'key', 'poses.I', 'found', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'instructor', 'Cueing', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'relaxed', 'flow', 'graceful', 'different', 'variations', 'poses', 'can', 'choose', 'one', 'best', 'suits', 'ability', 'found', 'practice', 'be', 'beautiful', 'rejuvinating', 'stressful', 'day', 'just', 'ticket', 'get', 'back', 'peaceful', 'more', 'centered', 'state', 'mind.The', 'photography', 'beautiful', 'filmed', 'island', 'Kauii', 'including', 'waterfalls', 'sunsets', 'lush', 'areas', 'where', 'Shiva', 'mat', 'surrounded', 'flowers', 'low', 'torches', 'Everything', 'dvd', 'relaxing.The', 'music', 'soft', 'meditative', 'beautifully', 'along', 'asanas', 'poses', '.You', 'will', 'leave', 'workout', 'feeling', 'renewed', 'more', 'flexible', 'calmer', 'more', 'peaceful', 'state', 'mind.This', 'excellent', 'addition', 'yoga', 'practice', 'regardless', 'level', 'experience', 'days', 'even', 'who', 'practice', 'more', 'strenuous', 'versions', 'yoga', 'need', 'more', 'gentle', 'practice', 'days.I', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Shiva', 'Flow', 'Yoga', 'DVD', 'would', 'definitely', 'seek', 'out', 'other', 'dvd', 'created']",Shiva Rea: Flow Yoga for Beginners

1146038,A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0,B0014CSNDY,"Deb Nam-Krane ""dnkboston""","[2, 2]","I am a yoga and Pilates instructor- I would say offhand that I am probably not the target audience for this release.  However, I am always for new choreography and sequencing ideas, particularly for people who are new to yoga.  I've heard much about Rea's comforting, ""fluid"" instruction, so I thought this would worthwhile for me to explore.The practice is a little under 70 minutes- longer than most of the classes I teach, and longer than I typically spend on my own practice.  The Warmup is about thirteen minutes long, which I feel is too long even in the context of an hour+ practice.  There is a primer on Ujayyi Breathing, then linking that breath with arm movements.  Then we move to Cat with knee pulls to begin mobilizing the spine, then explore Plank and its variations.  Next are introductions to Half Chaturanga, Cobra, Single Leg Locust and Down Dog.  Throughout, Rea provided soothing instruction and insights to help people new to yoga and/or working on strength and flexibility.Next section, Backbends, began standing with diagonal arm sweeps, then a flow between a modified standing Camel and Mountain, then another flow between a Roll Down and Back Bend.  Then we moved into a Forward Fold with Chest Opener.  Next we moved to our knees, moving to a Knee Lunge then Hamstring Stretch/Half-Split, then Half Chaturanga, Cobra, Half Bow, and Cat with Knee Pulls.  Once we've completed the work to both sides, we Roll Up to standing again and move into Side Bends, Back Bends, Chair and Chair with a Twist.  After Forward Bend, we move back to Lunge, but this time add a Twist.  We use Hamstring Stretch again as a Counter Pose, then move to Quarter Dog to open the upper body.  After Half Chaturanga, we continue with Bow, briefly rest, then move to Camel, Hero and move to our backs to relax the back after the Back Bends.The next segment is called Flexibility Flow, but it is focused completely on the lower body, primarily the hips.  We do Knee Pulls, the Number Four Stretch, Hamstring Stretch and Wind Relieving.  We next do a Supine Butterfly which turns into a Swaying Hip Opener, still on our backs.  Next we sit up and move into an Undulating Butterfly before setting into the full posture.  We close that section with Easy Pose.The next section, Standing Poses, includes some of the poses from the other sections, particularly Lunges and Chaturangas.  We perform a Vinyasa including Half Chaturanga, Cobra and Down Dog then move into a Lunge Sequence.  A la many vinyasa practices, we repeat the cycle, adding in more challenging back bends (Bow, Locust, High Cobra) and more challenging standing movements (Half Warrior, Half Side Angle, Warrior 2.  The entire practice concludes with Savasana.My verdict: The warm up and the back bend sequence were of the most use to me in that they provided the most variety.  However, it started going downhill for me with the Hip Openers and the Standing Sequence- I just felt that there was not enough variety, and I would think that most beginners would need variety even more than seasoned practitioners.  However, Rea does create a peaceful, relaxing and encouraging atmosphere, so for that reason I'll bump my review up to three stars.",3,"Comforting, with some room to grow",1219017600,"08 18, 2008",2008,3206,"['am', 'yoga', 'instructor-', 'would', 'say', 'am', 'probably', 'not', 'target', 'audience', 'release', 'However', 'am', 'always', 'new', 'choreography', 'sequencing', 'ideas', 'particularly', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'new', 'yoga', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'much', 'Rea', 'comforting', 'fluid', 'instruction', 'thought', 'would', 'worthwhile', 'explore.The', 'practice', 'little', '70', 'minutes-', 'longer', 'most', 'classes', 'teach', 'longer', 'typically', 'spend', 'own', 'practice', 'Warmup', 'thirteen', 'minutes', 'long', 'feel', 'too', 'long', 'even', 'context', 'hour+', 'practice', 'primer', 'Ujayyi', 'Breathing', 'then', 'linking', 'breath', 'arm', 'movements', 'Then', 'move', 'Cat', 'knee', 'pulls', 'begin', 'mobilizing', 'spine', 'then', 'explore', 'Plank', 'variations', 'Next', 'are', 'introductions', 'Half', 'Chaturanga', 'Cobra', 'Single', 'Leg', 'Locust', 'Down', 'Dog', 'Throughout', 'Rea', 'provided', 'soothing', 'instruction', 'insights', 'help', 'people', 'new', 'yoga', 'and/or', 'working', 'strength', 'flexibility.Next', 'section', 'Backbends', 'began', 'standing', 'diagonal', 'arm', 'sweeps', 'then', 'flow', 'modified', 'standing', 'Camel', 'Mountain', 'then', 'flow', 'Roll', 'Down', 'Back', 'Bend', 'Then', 'moved', 'Forward', 'Fold', 'Chest', 'Opener', 'moved', 'knees', 'moving', 'Knee', 'Lunge', 'then', 'Hamstring', 'Stretch/Half-Split', 'then', 'Half', 'Chaturanga', 'Cobra', 'Half', 'Bow', 'Cat', 'Knee', 'Pulls', ""'ve"", 'completed', 'work', 'sides', 'Roll', 'Up', 'standing', 'again', 'move', 'Side', 'Bends', 'Back', 'Bends', 'Chair', 'Chair', 'Twist', 'Forward', 'Bend', 'move', 'back', 'Lunge', 'time', 'add', 'Twist', 'use', 'Hamstring', 'Stretch', 'again', 'Counter', 'Pose', 'then', 'move', 'Quarter', 'Dog', 'open', 'upper', 'body', 'Half', 'Chaturanga', 'continue', 'Bow', 'briefly', 'rest', 'then', 'move', 'Camel', 'Hero', 'move', 'backs', 'relax', 'back', 'Back', 'Bends.The', 'next', 'segment', 'called', 'Flexibility', 'Flow', 'focused', 'completely', 'lower', 'body', 'primarily', 'hips', 'do', 'Knee', 'Pulls', 'Number', 'Four', 'Stretch', 'Hamstring', 'Stretch', 'Wind', 'Relieving', 'next', 'do', 'Supine', 'Butterfly', 'Swaying', 'Hip', 'Opener', 'still', 'backs', 'sit', 'up', 'move', 'Undulating', 'Butterfly', 'setting', 'full', 'posture', 'close', 'section', 'Easy', 'Pose.The', 'next', 'section', 'Standing', 'Poses', 'poses', 'other', 'sections', 'particularly', 'Lunges', 'Chaturangas', 'perform', 'Vinyasa', 'including', 'Half', 'Chaturanga', 'Cobra', 'Down', 'Dog', 'then', 'move', 'Lunge', 'Sequence', 'A', 'la', 'many', 'vinyasa', 'practices', 'repeat', 'cycle', 'adding', 'more', 'challenging', 'back', 'Bow', 'Locust', 'High', 'Cobra', 'more', 'challenging', 'standing', 'movements', 'Half', 'Warrior', 'Half', 'Side', 'Angle', 'Warrior', '2', 'entire', 'practice', 'concludes', 'Savasana.My', 'verdict', 'warm', 'up', 'back', 'bend', 'sequence', 'were', 'most', 'use', 'provided', 'most', 'variety', 'However', 'started', 'going', 'downhill', 'Hip', 'Openers', 'Standing', 'Sequence-', 'just', 'felt', 'was', 'not', 'enough', 'variety', 'would', 'think', 'most', 'beginners', 'would', 'need', 'variety', 'even', 'more', 'seasoned', 'practitioners', 'However', 'Rea', 'create', 'peaceful', 'relaxing', 'encouraging', 'atmosphere', 'so', 'reason', ""'ll"", 'bump', 'review', 'up', 'three', 'stars']",Shiva Rea: Flow Yoga for Beginners
1146039,A2VZP50FSYD6CO,B0014CSNDY,drebbles,"[1, 1]","Shiva Rea's Flow Yoga for Beginners is meant to be an introduction to this form of yoga. The DVD has several menu options including an Introduction which explains Flow Yoga and the essence of the program; play the entire workout; a chapter index; a biography of Shiva Rea; and music options (you can choose to just have music or have music and instructions). The chapter index also has several options: Foundation Flow; Beginner's Backward Flow; Beginner's Flexibility Flow; Shavagena; and the closing credits.While it is labeled ""beginners"" and the box to the DVD says no yoga experience is necessary, this is a tough workout and I wouldn't recommend it for newcomers to yoga. It starts off slowly enough with a seated meditation that is meant to teach you how to link breath with movement, although it never really helped me get into the zone. After a few easy minutes, the yoga quickly became more difficult, although there are plenty of rest breaks built into the routine. Shiva Rea doesn't always explain what to do next, instead she just goes into the next move, which is frustrating for a beginner like me. It also broke the flow of yoga for me, as I constantly had to focus on the TV to see what she was doing instead of concentrating on the yoga. The DVD was filmed in Hawaii, a beautiful setting, but the camera sometimes focused too much on the scenery instead of the yoga. I also had a hard time positioning the yoga mat in order to see the TV, which made doing the yoga awkward.While the yoga seemed to be good, it was not for beginners as advertised and you need to be quite flexible to do it.

1146041,A1BDPRQ7BEUNLP,B0014CSNDY,"Erik Olson ""Seeker Reviews""","[4, 5]","I enjoy yoga, but I usually prefer it in twenty to thirty-minute doses after cardio.  I find yoga valuable for maintaining flexibility and enhancing muscular control as I enter middle age.  My longtime favorite yoga practice on DVD has been Sara Ivanhoe's Yoga Makeover set of five 20-minute yoga workouts.  However, I've been using them for quite a while and I'm ready for a change-up.  With that goal in mind I got ""Shiva Rea - Flow Yoga for Beginners.""  Although Ms. Ivanhoe's videos are still my favorite, this Shiva Rea workout will add the spice of variety.I was a bit hesitant to get this DVD since I could never get into her popular Yoga Shakti Complete Practice workout.  One of my biggest pet peeves with that one was the lack of time listings for the workout segments.  I like knowing how long a DVD workout is going to run so I can make an informed purchase and subsequently manage my workout time.  Unfortunately, this program also lacks segment durations on the packaging.  Yes, the back of the box states there is approximately 70 minutes on the DVD.  But there are five routines with unknown and differing durations.  Therefore, I had to go in blind and hope that the routines were a suitable length.  Thankfully they are.  But I shouldn't have to take such a leap of faith.  What's so hard about adding an individual workout routine time stamp to the packaging for buyer convenience?  I even checked Shiva Rea's self-named website hoping to get time info, but no such luck.  I went ahead and used the counter in my PC's DVD software to estimate the routine lengths:1. Foundation Flow.  Set by a waterfall.  Poses include Downward Dog (with interesting variations) and Wisdom Pose.  About 14 minutes.2. Beginner's Backbend Flow. Set next to a lily pond, on a small lawn with a pad surrounded by pots with burning wicks.  Lots of standing back work.  About 20 minutes.3. Relaxing Flexibility Flow.  Setting is the same as #2.  Lots of leg stretches done while lying on the back.  Nice hip opener towards the end.  About 10 minutes.4. Beginner's Standing Pose Flow. Set on the beach during sunset.  Includes Downward Dog w/leg raises and Half Warrior 2 pose.  About 20 minutes.5. Shavasana. Set on the beach close to the end of sunset.  A quick relaxation routine done while lying on one's back.  About 2 minutes.I worked my way through routines 2-4 and found them to be a good supplement to my cardio workout (I watched routines 1 and 5 while timing the routines on my PC).  Overall, I enjoyed the practices.  For example, I was impressed at how my body opened up and felt stronger just when she said it would during the Beginner's Standing Pose Flow routine.  In addition, I liked the pose variations that Ms. Rea demonstrated, such as the hip opener in routine #3 and the Half Warrior Two in routine #4.  As for Ms. Rea, she's a good teacher and yoga role model.  Her voice and physicality are perfectly suited to yoga: restful and serene, yet powerful and confident.  The background music added to the soothing ambiance and helped me relax.  Finally, the workout scenery is peaceful and beautiful - especially the beach at sunset.However, along with the lack of time listings, I had some issues with the routines.  First, I'm not sure if this is really the best workout for a yoga newbie, especially an older person or someone with physical issues.  Ms. Rea leads this workout in voice-over, and sometimes things don't sync as well as they would have if she was calling in real time.  In addition, despite my decent level of fitness and yoga experience, my efforts to keep pace caused some problems with an old injury.  Ten years ago I had an ACL recon on my left knee using tissue from my hamstring.  Even after warming up, the Lunge in routine #2 tweaked my kneecap, and Half Warrior Two in routine #4 cramped my hamstring.  I'm hoping that these issues are aberrations, especially since I don't normally have that issue in Lunge pose.  Finally, even though I liked the beach scenery in routine #4, the filming took place too close to nightfall.  In some angles Ms. Rea's dark pants blended in with the sand so that it was hard to see her leg position.Thankfully, these issues aren't showstoppers.  As Ms. Rea recommends, watching the DVD before diving in will familiarize you with the workout's intricacies, and a large-screen newer model TV will help with the video (I used a 13"" CRT TV with integrated DVD player).  I consider ""Shiva Rea - Flow Yoga For Beginners"" to be a good addition to my yoga workout routine.  It would be a fine introduction to Shiva Rea for young and daring yoga neophytes, but older yoga newbies and those with health issues should be careful and take time getting used to this workout.  Recommended - and I might even give ""Yoga Shakti"" another try...",4,How Flow Can You Go?,1210982400,"05 17, 2008",2008,4800,"['enjoy', 'yoga', 'usually', 'prefer', 'twenty', 'thirty-minute',

She constantly reminds you to do what you can and DEMONSTRATES modifications which we used most of the time.

1146046,A2AC3VJPUZS42C,B0014CSNDY,Jenny G,"[6, 7]","I am not a big yoga fan. In fact, most yoga DVDs bore me.  But something about Shiva in the video clips always intrigued me.  She is really an awesome instructor. I wish I had paid less attention to the reviewers that said this DVD was not for beginners, as I wasted time and money on some really boring beginner DVDs.I look at yoga as a way to enhance the other fitness activities I already do.  I completed the first three flows today after doing the elliptical trainer and strength exercises, in replacement of my regular stretching & flexibility routine.  I would not normally complete 45 minutes of yoga in one sitting, so I do appreciate that each of these flows can be performed individually.I have hip dysplasia on my right side, a bad knee (left side), and a posterior innominate rotation on my left (this means when my back rotates my right leg becomes shorter than my left). Thanks to physical therapy and a focus on core strength & flexibility the rotation is now mostly stable. I continue to work through the other issues.  While I may comment on these limitations in my review, I would not deduct points in my rating because this DVD does not claim to be therapeutic for any of these.  I simply include the notes in case they are of help to someone else who may have some similar limitations.These are the flows I completed today:1) Foundation flow:  This was a very relaxing and simple flow, starting with breathing and going through some basic flexibility poses. The breathing would be something that if presented wrong would really bore me, but Shiva did a great job.2) Beginner's Backbend Flow:  I had completed part of this flow as a bonus on another DVD and it convinced me to order this DVD. This is such a relaxing flow. I can see completing this flow many times in the future.  With hip dysplasia on one side and a bad knee on the other, I find balance when doing lunges on one side is not as good as it should be.  At times I did place one hand on a table for balance.  I look forward to my balance improving as I repeat this flow.  Also, I did not squat down as low as Shiva did when doing the chair pose with twist, but found my own variation.  The only pose I did not perform was the bow pose (for fear of pulling on my knee), so I did cobra instead. With some slight modifications, I feel this flow can be adjusted for beginners, and Shiva also mentions some modifications during the flow.3) Relaxing Flexibility Flow: Coming from a non-yoga background, I recognize variations on standard priformis and hamstring stretches.  (I do use a stretch strap for the hamstring stretches.)  This is followed by a great hip/inner thigh stretch that was new for me, and then a sitting forward bend. This flow is very relaxing and I think most people would be able to complete it.I agree with other reviewers that it would have been nice to have a matrix as the fourth flow appears to be quite different than the other ones, and the shivasana is at the end.I have not yet tried the Beginner's Standing Pose Flow, and will likely update my review once I have.  I think this is the most challenging flow on the DVD, and gives me something to work into. I have also ordered Shiva's newest DVD (Daily Energy - Vinyasa Flow Yoga) and can't wait to receive it.UPDATE:  I've used the first three flows many times times now and love them.  I've already worked past the minor limitations I mentioned from the backbending flow.  I can see using these flows, in particular the backbending flow over and over again.I finally did get to the standing flow today.  I did flows in this order: Standing, Backbend, Flexibility.  I felt so relaxed when I was done. These are nice, gentle, soothing flows for me.

1146047,AU3GYRAKBUAEU,B0014CSNDY,Jon Norris,"[197, 208]","This is a good yoga video. It is well shot with good production values and clear narration. If one is already familiar with hatha yoga, one will not have trouble following along and doing Shiva Rea's routines. It is good for a ""video workout partner,"" and gives you the choice of watching the set without narration.Ms. Rea is obviously competent, talented, and very adept at yoga. She is quite attractive and demonstrates the overall forms and their ""flow"" well. The routines are modifications or variations of more traditional forms of yoga, but not drastically so. Some of the forms reminded me of qigong.The set of exercises on this DVD would constitute a healthy program for someone already in fairly good shape, but I seriously doubt that a couch potato with no understanding of yoga could benefit from it. If you are elderly or have any kind of physical issue, there is no instruction aimed at helping you do the forms or modify them for your needs.I have to take issue with the marketing of this DVD with the clear statement on the cover that it is for beginners with no yoga experience. I strongly disagree with that. Ms. Rea uses sanskrit terminology frequently without explaining or defining it, and assumes a fair amount of familiarity with yogic techniques/philosophy in her narration. Someone who knows nothing about yoga would not be able to understand all of what is going on, even though they might be able to mimic most of the physical movements after studying the DVD. They will miss some of the more important parts of the process, which are internal/energy-based, and therefore not obvious to a beginner.For example, telling someone to ""move into Downward Facing Dog"" is NOT teaching them how to do Downward Facing Dog, which is what beginners need. It loses one star for that serious defect in teaching and misleading cover.It would also be more helpful to show closeups of the various body parts and have her explain more clearly how they are moving. Some of the movements are far too subtle to be captured in a wide shot, no matter how beautiful that shot is. The breathing exercises at the beginning are a clear case in point. It is virtually impossible to see the subtle movements she narrates as she does them. Not very helpful if one is trying to learn something unfamiliar.If she would add another (equally well done) section where she explains in much more detail how each posture is done, along with onscreen text and multiple views, this could easily be a solid 5 star DVD. She also needs to add more instruction on esoteric ideas like ""opening your heart"" and ""moving your energy,"" as well as to explain the sanskrit terminology, before demonstrating the actual flow of forms.If you are already familiar with yoga or other energy/movement forms such as qigong or Taiji, then you will probably be able to learn from this DVD, although it will require more effort on your part than it should. If you already know the forms, it is a great ""workout partner"" to exercise along with.I would definitely not recommend this for absolute beginners.",3,"good, but NOT for beginners",1209772800,"05 3, 2008",2008,3070,"['good', 'yoga', 'video', 'well', 'shot', 'good', 'production', 'values', 'clear', 'narration', 'one', 'already', 'familiar', 'hatha', 'yoga', 'one', 'will', 'not', 'have', 'trouble', 'following', 'along', 'doing', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'routines', 'good', 'video', 'workout', 'partner', 'choice', 'watching', 'set', 'narration.Ms', 'Rea', 'obviously', 'competent', 'talented', 'very', 'adept', 'yoga', 'quite', 'attractive', 'overall', 'forms', 'flow', 'well', 'routines', 'are', 'modifications', 'variations', 'more', 'traditional', 'forms', 'yoga', 'not', 'drastically', 'so', 'forms', 'reminded', 'qigong.The', 'set', 'exercises', 'DVD', 'would', 'constitute', 'healthy', 'program', 'someone', 'already', 'fairly', 'good', 'shape', 'seriously', 'doubt', 'couch', 'potato', 'understanding', 'yoga', 'could', 'benefit', 'are', 'elderly', 'have', 'kind', 'physical', 'issue', 'instruction', 'aimed', 'helping', 'do', 'forms', 'modify', 'needs.I', 'have', 'take', 'issue', 'marketing', 'DVD', 'clear', 'statement', 'cover', 'beginners', 'yoga', 'experience', 'strongly', 'disagree', 'Ms.', 'Rea', 'sanskrit', 'terminology', 'frequently', 'explaining', 'defining', 'fair', 'amount', 'familiarity', 'yogic', 'techniques/philosophy', 'narration', 'Someone', 'who', 'nothing', 'yoga', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'understand', 'what', 'going', 'even', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'mimic', 'most', 'physical', 'movements', 'studying', 'DVD', 'will', 'miss', 'more', 'important', 'parts', 'process', 'are', 'internal/energy-based', 'therefore', 'not', 'obvious', 'beginner.For', 'example', 'telling', 'someone', 'move', 'Downward', 'Facing', 'Dog', 'NOT', 'teaching', 'how', 'do', 'Downward', 'Facing', 'Dog', 'what', 'beginners', 'need', 'one', 'star', 'serious', 'defect', 'teaching', 'misleading', 'cover.It', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'more', 'helpful', 'show', 'closeups', 'various', 'body', 'parts', 'have', 'explain', 'more', 'clearly', 'how', 'are', 'moving', 'movements', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'subtle', 'be', 'captured', 'wide', 'shot', 'matter', 'how', 'beautiful', 'shot', 'breathing', 'beginning', 'are', 'clear', 'case', 'point', 'virtually', 'impossible', 'see', 'subtle', 'movements', 'Not', 'very', 'helpful', 'one', 'trying', 'learn', 'something', 'unfamiliar.If', 'would', 'add', 'equally', 'well', 'done', 'section', 'where', 'much', 'more', 'detail', 'how', 'posture', 'done', 'onscreen', 'text', 'multiple', 'views', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'solid', '5', 'star', 'DVD', 'also', 'add', 'more', 'instruction', 'esoteric', 'ideas', 'opening', 'heart', 'moving', 'energy', 'as', 'well', 'explain', 'sanskrit', 'terminology', 'demonstrating', 'actual', 'flow', 'forms.If', 'are', 'already', 'familiar', 'yoga', 'other', 'energy/movement', 'forms', 'such', 'qigong', 'Taiji', 'then', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'able', 'learn', 'DVD', 'will', 'require', 'more', 'effort', 'part', 'should', 'already', 'know', 'forms', 'great', 'workout', 'partner', 'exercise', 'with.I', 'would', 'definitely', 'not', 'recommend', 'absolute', 'beginners']",Shiva Rea: Flow Yoga for Beginners
1146048,A3INMIZIYJ9BQ4,B0014CSNDY,"Judi Fryer ""Judi,  Entertainment-glutton""","[1, 3]","This review is truly ONLY about this product as I have no prior knowledge or experience with yoga in any form or fashion, thus I make no comparison to any other yoga program.The surroundings are beautiful.  Having personal knowledge of the beauty of most of the Hawaiian Islands I can attest this is a very good representation of the true beauty and serenity of the setting.  However, in the lush dusk of the islands, I am generally not trying to learn or mimic anything, while with this DVD I am.  The 'darkness' of the DVD in some places was quite an annoyance to me because it is so important for beginners to be able to 'see' what they are supposed to be doing.The music, for the most part, is soothing, so I assume proper and good music for yoga.  A little bit of it seems frenetic and perhaps out of place, but I can't say that is absolutely the case basing the statement solely on my perception that yoga is all about meditation and inner calmness.The look and sound of the DVD are calming in the same manner as the sleep-inducing sounds available on my clock radio.  However, even I know that there is more to yoga than that.The descriptions, such as flow yoga, vinyasa yoga, badhakonasana, and savasana have no meaning to me ywt.Other reviewers mention Shiva 'mislabels' or changes the names of certain universal yoga movements.  This was not a distraction, since I didn't know the correct titles.  Will it be a hindrance when branching out to other Yoga programs?  Perhaps.  If the position names are usually set in stone, I would assume when I see them again, I will recognize them regardless of their name.Regarding the divisions of the different types of yoga and their placement on the DVD; again, I have no idea of the pros and cons.  I just try to do what I am told when I am told.  I would guess this really doesn't matter for any beginner since at this point we are just trying to become familiar with yoga in general.As an individual who had done very little physical exercise or training since ceasing ballroom dancing fifteen years ago, I can really be called a beginner in 'exercise' of any style.  My age isn't young.  My job, my hobbies, and my overall lifestyle are very physically sedentary.  Therefore, some of the positions and stretches on this DVD are very literally quite a stretch for me.  The program definitely gives me goals and the absolute opportunity to 'grow into it' in a manner many beginner programs do not allow, those being entirely too simple at the outset.My idea when ordering this beginning-yoga DVD was to expose myself to the world of yoga, what it is about and what it has to offer.  This program does that and does it well.  Will it lead a beginner further down the road to loving yoga?  That of course will be an individual decision for each purchaser, but at least they will have a very good idea of where the yoga path leads should they decide to continue.Speaking solely for myself, my biggest hurdle has been the calm speaking voice of the instructor.  While physically sedentary, the mental and intellectual part of my job is rather frantic and very fast paced and this style of speaking is as far out of my natural environment as physical exercise itself.  Can I adjust?  Only time will tell.",4,Beginning yoga,1208995200,"04 24, 2008",2008,3251,"['review', 'truly', 'ONLY', 'product', 'have', 'prior', 'knowledge', 'experience', 'yoga', 'form', 'fashion', 'thus', 'make', 'comparison', 'other', 'yoga', 'program.The', 'surroundings', 'are', 'beautiful', 'Having', 'personal', 'knowledge', 'beauty', 'most', 'Hawaiian', 'Islands', 'can', 'attest', 'very', 'good', 'representation', 'true', 'beauty', 'serenity', 'setting', 'However', 'lush', 'dusk', 'islands', 'am', 'generally', 'not', 'trying', 'learn', 'mimic', 'anything', 'DVD', 'am', ""'darkness"", 'DVD', 'places', 'was', 'quite', 'annoyance', 'so', 'important', 'beginners', 'be', 'able', ""'see"", 'what', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'doing.The', 'music', 'most', 'part', 'soothing', 'assume', 'proper', 'good', 'music', 'yoga', 'little', 'bit', 'frenetic', 'perhaps', 'place', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'absolutely', 'case', 'basing', 'statement', 'solely', 'perception', 'yoga', 'meditation', 'inner', 'calmness.The', 'look', 'sound', 'DVD', 'are', 'calming', 'same', 'manner', 'sleep-inducing', 'sounds', 'available', 'clock', 'radio', 'However', 'even', 'know', 'more', 'yoga', 'that.The', 'descriptions', 'such', 'flow', 'yoga', 'vinyasa', 'yoga', 'badhakonasana', 'savasana', 'have', 'meaning', 'ywt.Other', 'reviewers', 'mention', 'Shiva', ""'mislabels"", 'names', 'certain', 'universal', 'yoga', 'movements', 'was', 'not', 'distraction', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'correct', 'titles', 'Will', 'be', 'hindrance', 'when', 'branching', 'out', 'other', 'Yoga', 'programs', 'Perhaps', 'position', 'names', 'are', 'usually', 'set', 'stone', 'would', 'assume', 'when', 'see', 'again', 'will', 'recognize', 'regardless', 'name.Regarding', 'divisions', 'different', 'types', 'yoga', 'placement', 'DVD', 'again', 'have', 'idea', 'pros', 'cons', 'just', 'try', 'do', 'what', 'am', 'told', 'when', 'am', 'told', 'would', 'guess', 'really', ""n't"", 'matter', 'beginner', 'point', 'are', 'just', 'trying', 'become', 'familiar', 'yoga', 'general.As', 'individual', 'who', 'had', 'done', 'very', 'little', 'physical', 'exercise', 'training', 'ceasing', 'ballroom', 'dancing', 'fifteen', 'years', 'ago', 'can', 'really', 'be', 'called', 'beginner', ""'exercise"", 'style', 'age', ""n't"", 'young', 'job', 'hobbies', 'overall', 'lifestyle', 'are', 'very', 'physically', 'sedentary', 'Therefore', 'positions', 'stretches', 'DVD', 'are', 'very', 'literally', 'quite', 'stretch', 'program', 'definitely', 'goals', 'absolute', 'opportunity', ""'grow"", 'manner', 'many', 'beginner', 'programs', 'do', 'not', 'allow', 'being', 'entirely', 'too', 'simple', 'outset.My', 'idea', 'when', 'ordering', 'beginning-yoga', 'DVD', 'was', 'expose', 'world', 'yoga', 'what', 'about', 'what', 'offer', 'program', 'well', 'Will', 'lead', 'beginner', 'further', 'road', 'loving', 'yoga', 'course', 'will', 'be', 'individual', 'decision', 'purchaser', 'least', 'will', 'have', 'very', 'good', 'idea', 'where', 'yoga', 'path', 'leads', 'should', 'decide', 'continue.Speaking', 'solely', 'biggest', 'hurdle', 'been', 'calm', 'speaking', 'voice', 'instructor', 'physically', 'sedentary', 'mental', 'intellectual', 'part', 'job', 'rather', 'frantic', 'very', 'fast', 'paced', 'style', 'speaking', 'far', 'natural', 'environment', 'physical', 'exercise', 'Can', 'adjust', 'Only', 'time', 'will', 'tell']",Shiva Rea: Flow Yoga for Beginners

The ""for beginners"" part obviously refers to vinyasa yoga. I am a semi-regular yoga practitioner, but I had no idea some of these poses, such as the backbends and lunges, could increase flexibility.Shiva Rea is an excellent teacher and the backdrop scenery of Kauai is simply stunning. (Depending on who you talk to, Hawai'i is one of the healthiest states in the U.S.). I give her high praise for using the real names of the asanas (pronounced AHS-annas). I also like the way she calls Child's Pose the Wisdom Pose. ""No pain, no gain"" doesn't apply to pushing your body beyond its tolerance. The whole point of most yoga practice is to make you aware of your breath so you can achieve greater consciousness in meditation, which you can't do if you're constantly obsessing about how 73 minutes seems like an eternity with your aching back/hip/shoulders. The great thing about the DVD is that you can perform the routines in chapters, so you can work at your own pace. And remember to rest in wisdom pose if you need to!

One that challenges beginners both new to yoga and exercise in general yet offers the more advanced a nice relaxing change of pace.  Sadly the order of the sequences really ruins it for me and stopping to fiddle with a dvd remote mid session is not something I should have to do.,2,Big Dealbreaker Here,1377648000,"08 28, 2013",2013,1011,"['have', 'several', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'videos', 'bought', 'one', 'what', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'relaxing', 'workout', 'when', 'want', 'unwind', 'working', 'too', 'hard', 'huge', 'dealbreaker', 'four', 'sections', 'standing', 'flow', 'poses', 'are', 'last', 'Right', 'section', 'more', 'relaxing', 'poses', 'should', 'prepare', 'Savasana', 'most', 'difficult', 'section', 'so', 'why', 'world', 'would', 'be', 'placed', ""'re"", 'already', 'relaxed', 'feeling', 'ooey', 'goody', 'yoga', 'good', 'not', 'flow', 'jolt', 'system', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'other', 'yoga', 'dvds', 'collection', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'so', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'using', 'much', 'ever', 'actually', 'shame', 'not', 'issue', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'excellent', 'dvd', 'One', 'beginners', 'new', 'yoga', 'exercise', 'general', 'more', 'advanced', 'nice', 'relaxing', 'change', 'pace', 'Sadly', 'order', 'sequences', 'really', 'stopping', 'fiddle', 'dvd', 'remote', 'mid', 'session', 'not', 'something', 'should', 'have', 'do']",Shiva Rea: Flow Yoga for Beginners

But I grew up in the era of Jane Fonda's 20 minute workouts.  I'm used to a complete workout in 20 minutes, not DVDs that break out different exercises for you to use in combination.If you already take yoga lessons and are trained in slowing down, and breathing properly, and moving through poses for an hour, then you'll love this beautifully produced DVD with its incredibly supple and peaceful guide talking you through the poses and moves.Or, if you are already a more meditative type of person who is familiar with yoga, this DVD would also be a good introduction.But if you are a harried mom juggling a ton of activities who struggles to find 10 minutes every day to take a shower, then while you may need this DVD very much, it probably will irritate you more than help you.  The yoga DVD that I still love the most is ""Stress Relief Yoga"" by Suzanne Deason.  Note that real yoga guru types disparage the DVD I recommend because it doesn't hold poses long enough, it moves too fast, etc...  But for my purposes at this stage of my life, that DVD really does it for me.This DVD, however, will have to wait until I am at a different point in my life.  From my perspective, this DVD is a 3.

1146054,A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B0014CSNDY,"Lisa Shea ""be the change you wish to see in t...","[35, 36]","I have another hatha yoga DVD that was filmed in Hawaii, and it is just so nice to have the soothing sounds, beautiful backgrounds and gentle lighting of Hawaii helping you relax into your yoga poses. Shiva Rea's voice is smooth and encouraging, and while she is extremely flexible, she gives you hope as you go that, while you might not be limber right now, you can get that way with practice.This tape only has four real parts. You can either watch them chapter by chapter, or all in a row. You can also choose to watch them with music only, or with her verbal prompts.The sections each have their own location. Each is quite lovely! You get 15 minutes of basic poses, 20 minutes of a lot of standing backbends, 10 minutes of more relaxing stretches, and the 25 minutes of a long repetitive sequence. Then there is a VERY super-short relaxation at the end.I think I was spoiled by my other DVD, because with the other one there are multiple hour-long sessions put together, each with its own theme - strengthening, relaxing, etc. With this one, you get just over an hour if you do the whole thing from start to end. But really you wouldn't want to do that - because that last set is a standalone rhythm set that you wouldn't really want to do after relaxing.  I wish this one was much more laid out for multiple uses - do set 1 if you have aim A, do set 2 if you have aim B. Also, the sessions should be labeled with how long they will take, so you can plan out your activity. There isn't even any note on the back of the case or in the insert with any times.I realize you can't control nature, but their timing was off on the filming of some of the segments. The final beach segment got REALLY dark in some parts so you couldn't see what she was doing. Also, the camera work would show her from her top half only while she talked about doing something with her bottom half. I'm not quite that psychic yet :)I think as far as it went, it was awesome. If I want to do a 25 minute rhythm exercise, I can do that fourth chapter. But if I want to do more than that, I'd have to go jumping around from chapter to chapter chaining together things that didn't really flow well. I would have given this five stars if it had much more content, even if some was repeated. If she had presented perhaps 4 full ""workouts"" with each one having a warm up, a main section (whatever she wanted to do for that) and then a wind down, that would have been great. You can always fast forward if you want to shorten it up a bit. But the way it is now, you can't really do an hour long workout. You can barely do just over a half hour workout. I would like something longer than that.Also, the sound at the very beginning was very intrusive. There are different music selections as you go and the later ones were lovely, background and non-interfering. It was just that first set that seemed to interrupt what she was trying to say. It was ironic to me that they had a soundtrack option of music-only, or music-and-voice. I would have preferred a voice-only option for that first segment!As a final minor complaint, she likes renaming poses into her own terms :) I think for a DVD being marketed to people who are using several DVDs and books and such, she should probably go with the standard names for poses so that things don't get confusing.Still, it's a nice addition to a library. I wouldn't suggest this as the only DVD on yoga to own, but if you have good staples in your collection already, this makes a nice alternative  for when you want a quick half hour of moving stretch.",4,Great Moving Yoga with Lovely Scenery,1208736000,"04 21, 2008",2008,3564,"['have', 'hatha', 'yoga', 'DVD', 'was', 'filmed', 'Hawaii', 'just', 'so', 'nice', 'have', 'soothing', 'sounds', 'beautiful', 'backgrounds', 'gentle', 'lighting', 'Hawaii', 'helping', 'relax', 'yoga', 'poses', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'voice', 'smooth', 'encouraging', 'extremely', 'flexible', 'hope', 'go', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'limber', 'right', 'now', 'can', 'get', 'way', 'practice.This', 'tape', 'only', 'four', 'real', 'parts', 'can', 'either', 'watch', 'chapter', 'chapter', 'row', 'can', 'also', 'choose', 'watch', 'music', 'only', 'verbal', 'prompts.The', 'sections', 'have', 'own', 'location', 'quite', 'lovely', 'get', '15', 'minutes', 'basic', 'poses', '20', 'minutes', 'lot', 'standing', 'backbends', '10', 'minutes', 'more', 'relaxing', 'stretches', '25', 'minutes', 'long', 'repetitive', 'sequence', 'Then', 'VERY', 'super-short', 'relaxation', 'end.I', 'think', 'was', 'spoiled', 'other', 'DVD', 'other', 'one', 'are', 'multiple', 'hour-long', 'sessions', 'put', 'together', 'own', 'theme', 'strengthening', 'relaxing', 'etc', 'one', 'get', 'just', 'hour', 'do', 'whole', 'thing', 'start', 'end', 'really', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'do', 'last', 'set', 'standalone', 'rhythm', 'set', 'would', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'do', 'relaxing', 'wish', 'one', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'laid', 'out', 'multiple', 'uses', 'do', 'set', '1', 'have', 'aim', 'A', 'do', 'set', '2', 'have', 'aim', 'B', 'Also', 'sessions', 'should', 'be', 'labeled', 'how', 'long', 'will', 'take', 'can', 'plan', 'out', 'activity', ""n't"", 'even', 'note', 'back', 'case', 'insert', 'times.I', 'realize', 'ca', ""n't"", 'control', 'nature', 'timing', 'was', 'off', 'filming', 'segments', 'final', 'beach', 'segment', 'got', 'REALLY', 'dark', 'parts', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'Also', 'camera', 'work', 'would', 'show', 'top', 'half', 'only', 'talked', 'doing', 'something', 'bottom', 'half', ""'m"", 'not', 'quite', 'psychic', 'yet', 'think', 'as', 'far', 'went', 'was', 'awesome', 'want', 'do', '25', 'minute', 'rhythm', 'exercise', 'can', 'do', 'fourth', 'chapter', 'want', 'do', 'more', ""'d"", 'have', 'go', 'jumping', 'around', 'chapter', 'chapter', 'chaining', 'together', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'flow', 'well', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'five', 'stars', 'had', 'much', 'more', 'content', 'even', 'was', 'repeated', 'had', 'presented', 'perhaps', '4', 'full', 'workouts', 'one', 'having', 'warm', 'up', 'main', 'section', 'wanted', 'do', 'then', 'wind', 'down', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'can', 'always', 'fast', 'forward', 'want', 'shorten', 'up', 'bit', 'way', 'now', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'hour', 'long', 'workout', 'can', 'barely', 'do', 'just', 'half', 'hour', 'workout', 'would', 'like', 'something', 'longer', 'that.Also', 'sound', 'very', 'beginning', 'was', 'very', 'intrusive', 'are', 'different', 'music', 'selections', 'go', 'later', 'ones', 'were', 'lovely', 'background', 'non-interfering', 'was', 'just', 'first', 'set', 'seemed', 'interrupt', 'what', 'was', 'trying', 'say', 'was', 'ironic', 'had', 'soundtrack', 'option', 'music-only', 'music-and-voice', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'voice-only', 'option', 'first', 'segment', 'final', 'minor', 'complaint', 'renaming', 'poses', 'own', 'terms', 'think', 'DVD', 'being', 'marketed', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'using', 'several', 'DVDs', 'books', 'such', 'should', 'probably', 'go', 'standard', 'names', 'poses', 'so', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'confusing.Still', 'nice', 'addition', 'library', 'would', ""n't"", 'suggest', 'only', 'DVD', 'yoga', 'own', 'have', 'good', 'staples', 'collection', 'already', 'nice', 'alternative', 'when', 'want', 'quick', 'half', 'hour', 'moving', 'stretch']",Shiva Rea: Flow Yoga for Beginners

She is in fantastic shape so I figured that her brand of yoga must be good.This dvd's menu has the following options: instructions, workouts, chapter index, Shiva Rea biography, music options, and other material available on dvd.  There are seven routines on this dvd.The very first exercise required an exercise pillow but a substitution was easily found.  We started with breathing and I didn't really grasp the meaning of her comments but continued onward.  It started out being a little too ""New Age"" for me.  How does one bend down with open heart exactly?  Keep your spine connected to the ground?  You mean keep it pressed down?  In the beginning, many of her instructions were too metaphysical for me and not simple physical directives.  I was rewarded when I continued as the more advanced the workout became, the more detailed and easy to follow were the instructions.The exercises seem great for strength and toning but I will probably stick to Wai Lana (Wai Lana Yoga: Beginners Workout)who embodies a more approachable yoga for me.

Having only ever done yoga from book diagrams and descriptions, I found this venture into yoga on DVD quite refreshing. I was sort of concerned that the verbal instruction would detract from the routine or that the instructor would move from one thing to another too quickly for me to look up to follow. However, the way that the DVD is set up is that you see a video of Shiva Rea doing the yoga routine in beautiful relaxing settings such as in front of a waterfall, in the middle of a forest, or on the beach. However, she's not talking during the yoga routine. Instead, the instruction and music is all tastefully added as separate tracks. You can choose to just watch the routine, watch it with just the music, or watch it with an off-camera narrator of the various movements. I also like how the camera pans at just the right moment so that you can get a different view of Shiva Rea to make sure that you've got the pose right. Another great feature of the CD is that the different parts of the yoga routine are divided into separate chapters so that you can start wherever you would like.The poses themselves are fairly simple and basic. There's no standing on your head or doing ridiculous things that the beginner couldn't join in with. Despite the slow nature of the routines, your heart and muscles get a nice work out. There were only a few times that I found myself unable to stretch my legs out quite like she could, but I'm sure practice will get me there.The only thing I think could be a little better would be the explanation of when to inhale and when to exhale. With a very slow yoga routine, I tend to forget which one I'm supposed to be doing, so I wish the narrator would have mentioned it more often. Also, I'd hoped the DVD would contain more than one routine so that I wouldn't get bored doing the exact same thing over and over again.Overall, I found the DVD to be quite enjoyable.

This is a variant of Surya Namaskara (Sun salutation), which is defined by a series of six specific postures with a breathing pattern. The narrator guides the viewers with instructions to practice the yoga postures, which is helpful for a beginner. The esoteric intention of vinysa is to facilitate the flow of prana (vital energy) to balance the koshs (sheaths) of the physical and metaphysical body. In a less esoteric language, the body heat increases circulation, contribute to muscle flexibility and strengthen the tissue and tendons. The last few minutes of the DVD is dedicated to Shavasana or Sarvasana that is performed to either begin or conclude a yoga session. It is a relaxing posture intended to rejuvenate the body, mind and spirit.The background music is set the drum beats of Hawaiian music; the producers could have considered using Hindustani classical music, especially instrumental music such as, sitar or violin using a morning or an evening raga as appropriate.1.Yoga For Beginners2.Yoga For Weight Loss - Beginner & Beyond (2007)3.Iyengar Yoga With Gabriella4.Vinyasa Flow Yoga, Simple and Sweet, Beginner & Intermediate, a ***Practice DVD***5.Vinyasa Flow Yoga, Grace, Power, Surf, and Sunset, Intermediate & Advanced, a ***Practice DVD***6.Charlie Rose with George Clooney; B.K.S.

1146069,A2NTYK9JC5H0LS,B0014CSNDY,Sarah Sheikh,"[0, 0]","Introduction includes Shiva Rea explaining about the state of flow to unite the mind, body and breath with creative intelligence:- the ability to move freely through the stream of unbroken of awareness. The essence of this program is to support this state of flow in your body and life through yoga! After such a great enlightening introduction, I could not wait to commence the program. I think it is important for people to understand the purpose of each type of yoga, and you will find it so beautifully described in the introduction by Shiva Rea, leaving you in no doubt as to the benefits of this particular type of yoga.For those of you who may not know who Shiva Rea is (perhaps you have spent several years meditating in a cave in the Himalayas?), her bio is included on the DVD menu, where you can find out that Shiva commenced yoga at the early age of 14, in order to understand why her father named her Shiva. You will also find out how varied Shiva's studies are:- from Ayurveda, world dance to Tantra, with one beautiful theme running through all of her studies. Shiva is known for her creativity and dynamism, and for offering the synthesis form of Vinyasa flow to people worldwide. For myself, when I met her this year, 2011, in London, I understood the name Shiva perfectly, as she embodies the fire and passion of yoga, but with much grace and fluidity from her spirituality.Foundation FlowDuring the foundational section, Shiva shares some simple, yet invigorating yoga movements, and also some very important teachings regarding strength and ability that I have simply not seen taught anywhere else:-&#34;It is very important in the beginning to develop the strength to self-support. The mistake people make in the beginning is using your hands and going higher than you actually have the strength and integrity to maintain&#34; Shiva Rea.The first section is just over 13 minutes in duration, and the setting is close to a waterfall, with a gentle yet invigorating background of drumming, that encourages you to relax into your practice.Shiva also shares another important aspect to exercising:-&#34;It is really important to feel your strength as something sacred, not as a torture or as a duty&#34;.Beginner's Backbend FlowWithin this section the speed of flow increases slightly, with just a couple of more challenging moves, but still at the beginners level, but some of the moves might be more suitable for the beginner who has practiced some very simple moves, but it is all still possible, and that is what will be so enjoyable for the beginner yogi/yogini. Prepare for some beautiful deep stretching to exhilarate the body, infusing the mind and heart with sublime equilibrium. Shiva Rea's voice will encourage you forward with your practice, however you are feeling on each day, with her gentle guidance, and the spirituality that emanates effortlessly from her being.The beautiful music, exotic scenery, flowers and flaming candles - with Shiva Rea's welcoming, relaxing and inspiring deep voice, will soon have you feeling that you have entered a Goddess Temple - offering something so different to other Yoga DVDs.Relaxing Flexibility FlowThis sequence is just over 10 minutes in duration, and will assist you to learn how to open your entire body up more, and Shiva encourages you that you will indeed open up with more flexibility over time, with repeated practice, which will really encourage the beginner, I am sure. Shiva does not demonstrate her full flexibility, as this is a DVD for beginners, and she wishes for you to focus on gently opening the body, like a flower, into greater increased flexibility. My body is feeling fantastic following the practice of this section, it is glowing, and I love Shiva's teachings that guide me gently, yet firmly, into getting more in touch with my body, and its own natural rhythms and abilities, and then going deeper and deeper into my body and its untapped potential. The beginners DVD allows you to explore such in a gentle and safe environment, where the teacher, Shiva, gently encourages you, yet expertly advises you, offering a unique combination of spiritual yoga awareness, finnese of poses, and a deep realisation of the potential to achieve perfect synchronicity of mind, body and soul co-ordination.Beginner's Standing Pose FlowThe final yoga sequence is the most dynamic of all of the sequences on the beginners DVD and is 21.30 in duration. Combining dynamic sequence, focused breath work, and increased attention to your body balance - you will receive a very valuable lesson in this section, to learn how to focus. I believe the focus learnt within this section will also carry through post practice, to other areas of your life, where you will learn that undivided focus will allow you to achieve a dynamic body space around you of connecting to the four directions, as Shiva teaches. Within this space you achieve increased balance, and within the alert balance positions, you can achieve more than you may have dreamt of. If you have ever struggled with learning the flow techniques of yoga, this section will teach you slowly, and then building the routine, you will, at the end of this section, practice the routine in the flow of which it is intended. The flow is not as difficult as you might think, when you are able to watch it fairly slowly (slowly for this type of yoga in any case), and Shiva's tuition is very valuable for the potential of mastering the flow to become a reality for you. As she is guiding you through every part of every pose, you will always know how to hold a pose, how and when to open up, and with Shiva's continued reminders regarding the breath, you will never lose touch of which part of the breath sequence you are in - and I find this to be very important, as with the correct breath work for the part of the sequence, all becomes possible, and also much easier.ShavasanaThe post yoga relaxation is sublime, and often much needed just to unwind gently after activity. It is amazing just how relaxed one can be after a 2 minute relaxation section, but this is all the time it takes when one completely surrenders to relaxation and &#34;switches off&#34;.",5,Discover

Burton,"[17, 34]","Don't waste your time and money on this 70 minute non-flowing ""workout.""""For Beginners,"" when applied to a workout means it's either for people with no prior experience or it's for people with a lower level of physical ability(my category).  This workout doesn't fit either description.  It moves slowly--which is often a pretense for a beginning level workout--but it goes nowhere.  You'll be saying, ""Are we there yet?"" but you'll never arrive.Because I am not physically strong but still like to work out, I buy a lot of beginner workouts.  Usually there is something to enjoy in all of them, but I found this one annoying.You must be very, very strong in your arms and legs.  Shiva Rea holds plank or other strenth-based poses for a long time.  She has you pulse in some poses which actually reduces flexibility rather than increasing it.  She has you twist in lunge and chair pose--unsupported--in order to warm up the spine for backbends.  Hello, if you want to warm up the spine with twists why not sit down?  I wasn't getting a warm-up while my thighs were burning and my balance was challenged.  It would be OK as a standing pose, but don't call it a warm-up and maybe don't hold it quite so long.Shiva Rea uses a lot of yoga terminology and there are no captions showing you the names or their English translations, so if you don't already know the names of the poses, you may never figure them out.Shiva Rea talks very slowly; it's hard to keep paying attention to her and keep focused.  The workout goes slowly.  I couldn't stay interested or enjoy it.And for those who care about such things, could she have worn modest shirts?  They were fine while she was standing up, but we spend forever doing plank pose or forward bending poses and the shots were often focused head-on.  Puh-lease, that's NOT what I want to be looking at when I do yoga; shots like that don't show me what the pose looks like.  I have a number of yoga videos that are much less offensive, so I know you don't have to wear stuff like that.",2,Dead Boring and NOT For Beginners,1210118400,"05 7, 2008",2008,2024,"['Do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'money', '70', 'minute', 'non-flowing', 'workout', 'Beginners', 'when', 'applied', 'workout', 'people', 'prior', 'experience', 'people', 'lower', 'level', 'physical', 'ability', 'category', 'workout', ""n't"", 'fit', 'description', 'slowly', 'often', 'pretense', 'beginning', 'level', 'workout', 'nowhere', ""'ll"", 'be', 'saying', 'Are', 'yet', ""'ll"", 'never', 'arrive.Because', 'am', 'not', 'physically', 'strong', 'still', 'work', 'out', 'buy', 'lot', 'beginner', 'workouts', 'Usually', 'something', 'enjoy', 'found', 'one', 'annoying.You', 'must', 'be', 'very', 'very', 'strong', 'arms', 'legs', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'plank', 'other', 'strenth-based', 'poses', 'long', 'time', 'pulse', 'poses', 'actually', 'flexibility', 'rather', 'increasing', 'twist', 'lunge', 'chair', 'pose', 'unsupported', 'order', 'warm', 'up', 'spine', 'backbends', 'Hello', 'want', 'warm', 'up', 'spine', 'twists', 'why', 'not', 'sit', 'down', 'was', ""n't"", 'getting', 'warm-up', 'thighs', 'were', 'burning', 'balance', 'was', 'challenged', 'would', 'be', 'OK', 'standing', 'pose', 'do', ""n't"", 'call', 'warm-up', 'maybe', 'do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'quite', 'so', 'long.Shiva', 'Rea', 'lot', 'yoga', 'terminology', 'are', 'captions', 'showing', 'names', 'English', 'translations', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'names', 'poses', 'may', 'never', 'figure', 'out.Shiva', 'Rea', 'talks', 'very', 'slowly', 'hard', 'keep', 'paying', 'attention', 'keep', 'focused', 'workout', 'slowly', 'could', ""n't"", 'stay', 'interested', 'enjoy', 'it.And', 'who', 'care', 'such', 'things', 'could', 'have', 'worn', 'modest', 'shirts', 'were', 'fine', 'was', 'standing', 'up', 'spend', 'forever', 'doing', 'plank', 'pose', 'forward', 'bending', 'poses', 'shots', 'were', 'often', 'focused', 'head-on', 'Puh-lease', 'NOT', 'what', 'want', 'be', 'looking', 'when', 'do', 'yoga', 'shots', 'do', ""n't"", 'show', 'what', 'pose', 'looks', 'have', 'number', 'yoga', 'videos', 'are', 'much', 'less', 'offensive', 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'wear', 'stuff']",Shiva Rea: Flow Yoga for Beginners

'I know squat about yoga, so this should be perfect!'What they don't mention is that this isn't necessarily for people not already rather fit.  Each segment requires a certain level of endurance and strength that many rank beginners just don't have.  She does make some modifications, but the moves remain difficult, sometimes prohibitively so.  Also, despite the proclamation on the box, it seems as though some foreknowledge of yoga is in fact necessary.  Some moves are cued by name rather than by description, which makes the first few viewings difficult to follow.Overall, I can't really say that I recommend this to beginners in general.

For now, here are my initial thoughts on it:Visually, it is beautiful (filmed on Kauai, Hawaii, my favorite of the Hawaiian islands).Production values seem very good on what I've seen so far.The instructor has a calming, pleasant voice and seems very experienced.*I* would not consider this a beginner's workout.  I was not even able to get into many of the poses in this workout much less to hold them for an extended period of time as is illustrated.  So that you can make a comparison, here is a little about me.  I'm 55 years old.  I'm about 40 pounds overweight.  My flexibility level is poor (I have osteoarthritis in my spine), but my fitness level is good.  For the past several years, I have been working out an average of 3-5 times per week and my workouts include cardio kickboxing, fast walking, tai chi, weight training and Pilates.  I have only taken 1 Yoga class and 1 Qijong class (both several years ago) previous to doing this DVD.A DVD workout that I have used many times (and love) that I WOULD consider appropriate for a beginner (though in Pilates, not yoga) isPilates Conditioning for Weight Loss.  It shows 3 different women doing the same workout at the beginner, intermediate and advanced levels, so that you can follow whichever one suits your fitness level and experience best.",3,"For Beginners?

Camera, editing, lighting, sound, set design is all gorgeous... you can see that in the videos. All instruction from her is given in voice over. She gives great information both in a spiritual manner & which specific anatomy muscles you are using as well as which are being stretched & how it benefits the body as a whole physically.Foundation Flow:  14 minBy a waterfall, Deep breathing/Prana & moving hands w/the breath. Table/cat with 1 need to nose & repeated several times. Practicing plank & chaturanga (low staff/plank pose), child's pose, mild push ups while on  knees to build upper body strength & practice getting into chaturanga, cobra, 1 leg up locust with arms down, going between table & downward dog several times, full downward dog & ends w/child's.Beginner's Back bend Flow: 21 minSee Video Below to see backdrop of her by a lily pond. Light side stretches w/outstretched hand like dvd cover. Standing fwd bends mild & then held a long time, mountain pose w/mild back bend/stretch a couple of times. Low lunge w/back knee on the floor. She calls half splits but also  similar to pyramid but lower. Mild chaturanga, cobra, locust w/just the arms up, child's, table w/knee to nose, other side lunge again w/o pyramid, standing fwd bend, mountain, simple standing side bend stretch,  mountain w/mild back bend, chair pose, chair w/prayer twist (she explains how to get more twist using the lower hand to push the top one up) (this is held for a very long time so it will be challenging to leg muscles) standing fwd bend, chair twist to the other side, standing fwd bend, lunge w/prayer twist (also held a long time), pyramid, downward dog on the knees which is much easier to do & opens up the shoulders as well),  lung w/prayer twist on other side, pyramid, bow, lay on stomach/rest, mild camel, hero's pose (she doesn't say it's name, it is very hard to do unless flexible & VERY bad on the knees if you have any issues, she only does it & says just sits back & stays sit cross legged if you have issues), sit & breathe deeply w/hands. Laying on back, both knees to chest, then both knees to one side then the other, then one knee to chest only, then other, then lay back to rest. This is very challenging for beginners as she holds the poses for much longer then most instructors & longer in one pose can really tax muscles.Relaxing Flexibility Flow: 10 minSame lily pond. Laying on back, one knee to chest only, then other, then one ankle crossed on one knee & pulled to the chest (held for over a minute), one knee bent & the other leg straight pulled toward the head. Repeat on other side, ankle crossed on knee (only held 45 seconds), leg to head. Both knees to chest, happy baby pose (on back with bent knees each knee to respective shoulder) & then slightly turn hips back/forth (very mild) & ends in butterfly. This is very mild & very relaxing, this is not a workout as more as light stretching. I found it too slow a pace & not enough poses for this length of time. This style is more yin yoga where poses are held a long time.Beginner's Standing Pose Flow: 22 minBeach scene you see on trailer. Table, child's, table, downward dog, 3 legged down dog w/one straight leg in sky, high lunge (back leg up), slow chaturanga on knees, mild cobra, child's, table, downward dog. Other side 3 legged down dog, high lunge (back leg up), faster chaturanga on knees, cobra, child's, downward dog. 3 legged down dog, mild warrior 2 (w/back leg resting on knee, not foot like full), mild side angle (same leg placement as previous pose & arm resting on knee only which is easier), chaturanga, mild locust w/arms & 1 leg,  child's, down dog. Same thing on the other side. 3 legged down dog, full warrior 2 (she does pelvic tilt here to teach you to pull hips toward the belly butt to lengthen the spine), reverse/revolved warrior, side angle (arm on knee still), warrior 2, pyramid (back knee on ground),chaturanga, half bow, child's, down dog. At faster speed, warrior 2, revolved warrior, side angle (hand on knee),  warrior 2, pyramid, chaturanga, full bow, child's & down dog.  Repeat again w/cobra instead of bow 4 more times. Rest in child's for a full minute. I did not like how this harder standing poses comes after relaxing laying back poses, it makes no sense after heating up with the back bend flow & cooling off with the flexibility flow.Shavasana: 2 minLaying down & her guiding you to relax 1/2 of it & silence the rest.Shiva Rea is very advanced yogini & I believe this is her first beginner DVD. She seems to be new at teaching beginners & is very tough almsot like the drill sargent of yoga. She has a lovely voice but there is a stiffness to it. I did not like how it flowed, nor something about her teaching. I found all her other yoga DVDs too advanced for me though I'd been practicing semi-regularly for over 6 years. I've had no problem & LOVE Rodney Yee, Rainbeau Mars, Sean Corn, Ateeka, Yoga for Sex (excuse the title, but it's normal yoga in fun format), The Firm's Power Yoga,  I also LIKE Susan Deason, Max Strom, Kristen Mcgee, Kabbalah Yoga, Yoga Radiance & a couple of others.3 MIN VIDEO: of the Beginner's Back bend Flow portion ON youtube under ""Cobra Pose with Shiva Rea"" from AcaciaFitness",3,Slow?

This is done with beginners in mind, sequentially, starting with subtle backbends to the final Bow pose.The Relaxing Flexability series (1/4 star off here) is so wonderful. Shiva Rea leads you through a series of poses that release tension in your back, legs and upper body. You will feel like you've been massaged.  The reason for 1/4 star off?  I can't figure out why this is not before the ending Shavasana.  I felt off kilter after being so relaxed and then going on too a more rigorous standing flowBeginning Standing Flow...this series is also great for beginners. Shiva, starts the beginning poses on your knees and with many modifications, so that, if you want, you can do the entire sequence on your knees and progress to standing.  I like DVD's to grow with..I don't want to be able to do the entire DVD at first (unless it's an aerobic workout)Lastly is Shavasana (another 1/4 point here) I feel like when I workout for over an hour, I want more than a minute or two of Shavasana.  Granted Shiva does say, you can stay here is long as you like, but the music is very gentle for a while and then comes a jarring drum beat, that takes away the feeling of tranquilty for me.  I would have preferred the softer music to just stay on and then fade away..Please, despite my few dislikes, this DVD is worth having if you are a beginner, if only for the instruction, beautiful scenery, and modifications.",4,I really enjoyed this DVD for Beginniners..4 1/2 stars,1208822400,"04 22, 2008",2008,1797,"['think', 'instruction', 'production', 'wise', 'one', 'best', 'beginner', 'DVD', 'yoga', 'have', 'come', 'Just', '2', 'glitches', 'Beginning', 'Foundation', 'Flow', 'Uujai', 'Breathing', 'breathing', 'movement', 'calm', 'center', 'rest', 'practice.The', 'Beginning', 'Backbend', 'Flow', 'again', 'breathing', 'movement', 'leading', 'eventually', 'upward', 'bow', 'pose', 'done', 'beginners', 'mind', 'sequentially', 'starting', 'subtle', 'backbends', 'final', 'Bow', 'pose.The', 'Relaxing', 'Flexability', 'series', '1/4', 'star', 'here', 'so', 'wonderful', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'series', 'poses', 'release', 'tension', 'back', 'legs', 'upper', 'body', 'will', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'been', 'massaged', 'reason', '1/4', 'star', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'not', 'ending', 'Shavasana', 'felt', 'off', 'kilter', 'being', 'so', 'relaxed', 'then', 'going', 'too', 'more', 'rigorous', 'standing', 'flowBeginning', 'Standing', 'Flow', 'series', 'also', 'great', 'beginners', 'Shiva', 'beginning', 'poses', 'knees', 'many', 'modifications', 'want', 'can', 'do', 'entire', 'sequence', 'knees', 'progress', 'standing', 'like', 'DVD', 'grow', 'with..I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'entire', 'DVD', 'first', 'aerobic', 'workout', 'Lastly', 'Shavasana', '1/4', 'point', 'here', 'feel', 'when', 'workout', 'hour', 'want', 'more', 'minute', 'two', 'Shavasana', 'Granted', 'Shiva', 'say', 'can', 'stay', 'here', 'long', 'music', 'very', 'gentle', 'while', 'then', 'jarring', 'drum', 'beat', 'away', 'feeling', 'tranquilty', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'softer', 'music', 'just', 'stay', 'then', 'fade', 'away..Please', 'few', 'dislikes', 'DVD', 'worth', 'having', 'are', 'beginner', 'only', 'instruction', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'modifications']",Shiva Rea: Flow Yoga for Beginners
1146079,A2QNJARWTF9H89,B0014CSNDY,"William D. Colburn ""buys things on amazon far...","[0, 0]","The cover of this DVD proclaims, ""No yoga experience necessary"", but I don't believe it.  Someone new to yoga couldn't possibly keep up with the moves; nor would they know the ""lingo"" to understand what some of the instructions are.The scenes are filmed in some amazing places, and the soundtracks that go along with the instructions are wonderful.  You have the choice to hear just the soundtrack, or the soundtrack and the instruction.  The video editing leaves a lot to be desired though.  Too many cuts make an otherwise relaxing experience seem jarring.Two strikes against it, but I'll still give it four out of five stars.  As I said, I like the music, and I love the background scenery.  It doesn't have the ""workout"" feel that a lot of yoga DVDs have.  There is almost no repetition; just move after move showing you lots of flow yoga moves.  It makes yoga look relaxing and calm, where a lot of DVDs make it seem like a training video for a yoga army.",4,"Great DVD, but not for beginners to yoga",1210809600,"05 15, 2008",2008,960,"['cover', 'DVD', 'yoga', 'experience', 'necessary', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Someone', 'new', 'yoga', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'keep', 'up', 'moves', 'would', 'know', 'lingo', 'understand', 'what', 'instructions', 'scenes', 'are', 'filmed', 'amazing', 'places', 'soundtracks', 'go', 'along', 'instructions', 'are', 'wonderful', 'have', 'choice', 'hear', 'just', 'soundtrack', 'soundtrack', 'instruction', 'video', 'editing', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'Too', 'many', 'cuts', 'make', 'otherwise', 'relaxing', 'experience', 'seem', 'jarring.Two', 'strikes', ""'ll"", 'still', 'give', 'four', 'five', 'stars', 'said', 'like', 'music', 'love', 'background', 'scenery', ""n't"", 'have', 'workout', 'feel', 'lot', 'yoga', 'DVDs', 'have', 'almost', 'repetition', 'just', 'move', 'move', 'showing', 'lots', 'flow', 'yoga', 'moves', 'yoga', 'look', 'relaxing', 'calm', 'where', 'lot', 'DVDs', 'make', 'training', 'video', 'yoga', 'army']",Shiva Rea: Flow Yoga for Beginners
1146080,A2V0I904FH7ABY,B0014CSNDY,XNOR,"[1, 2]","The best way to know if your yoga class/dvd is good is to ask yourself a question:- Do you feel relaxed and calm after the yoga class ?- Does your body feel light and breath fuild and calm after the class ?This Yoga DVD does both of these and they compound each day with every practise.Even though I do not have a very flexible body, I never felt that I am being too pressurized and hard to do yoga poses in this DVD - it was smooth, flowing and almost effortless.  Depending on your age and body condition, you may feel varying difficulties, but neverthless it is a beginners program and a very good way to start your yoga practise.The other Yoga DVD which I have been following before I got into Shiva Rea is Bryan Kest's Power Yoga series, in which I have just been doing the video 1 (Beginner's series) - there are both +ves and -ves when I compare these DVDs- In comparison to Shiva Rea, I find Bryan's narration to be more information and more helpful - he makes certain  basics of yoga very clear such as (1) Make breath your priority, breath is the priority and the asans come after (2) Do not push or jam yourself into doing a pose and make yourself uncomfortable, if you are feeling uncomofortable, you are defeating the very purpose of doing yoga .... and may other such small tips and general overview of the basics which are very important for a beginner.  But Bryan kests poses are a bit more difficult to do.Shiva Rea makes the yoga poses very easy and doable effortlessly.Overall, if you are new to yoga, try Shiva Rea Yoga first and then you can move to Bryan kest's yoga series.",5,"Good for beginners, easy to follow - but brings out the benefits of a Yoga practise",1210636800,"05 13, 2008",2008,1596,"['best', 'way', 'know', 'yoga', 'class/dvd', 'good', 'ask', 'question', 'Do', 'feel', 'relaxed', 'calm', 'yoga', 'class', 'body', 'feel', 'light', 'breath', 'fuild', 'calm', 'class', 'Yoga', 'DVD', 'compound', 'day', 'practise.Even', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'very', 'flexible', 'body', 'never', 'felt', 'am', 'being', 'too', 'pressurized', 'hard', 'do', 'yoga', 'poses', 'DVD', 'was', 'smooth', 'flowing', 'almost', 'effortless', 'Depending', 'age', 'body', 'condition', 'may', 'feel', 'varying', 'difficulties', 'beginners', 'program', 'very', 'good', 'way', 'start', 'yoga', 'other', 'Yoga', 'DVD', 'have', 'been', 'following', 'got', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'Bryan', 'Kest', 'Power', 'Yoga', 'series', 'have', 'just', 'been', 'doing', 'video', '1', 'Beginner', 'series', 'are', '+ves', '-ves', 'when', 'compare', 'DVDs-', 'comparison', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'find', 'Bryan', 'narration', 'be', 'more', 'information', 'more', 'helpful', 'certain', 'basics', 'yoga', 'very', 'clear', 'such', '1', 'Make', 'breath', 'priority', 'breath', 'priority', 'asans', 'come', '2', 'Do', 'not', 'push', 'jam', 'doing', 'pose', 'make', 'uncomfortable', 'are', 'feeling', 'uncomofortable', 'are', 'defeating', 'very', 'purpose', 'doing', 'yoga', 'may', 'other', 'such', 'small', 'tips', 'general', 'overview', 'basics', 'are', 'very', 'important', 'beginner', 'Bryan', 'poses', 'are', 'bit', 'more', 'difficult', 'do.Shiva', 'Rea', 'yoga', 'poses', 'very', 'easy', 'doable', 'effortlessly.Overall', 'are', 'new', 'yoga', 'try', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'Yoga', 'first', 'then', 'can', 'move', 'Bryan', 'kest', 'yoga', 'series']",Shiva Rea: Flow Yoga for Beginners
1146081,A2L6EV0V3SOATU,B0014CSNDY,Yoni,"[92, 97]","I was so glad to get another new Shiva DVD less than 5 months since her last one. This DVD was filmed in  Kauai , Hawaii as well as her next DVD's to be released this year and next year. This practice is aimed for beginners but everyone can enjoy it , the whole DVD is 70 minutes and has 4 segments (and savasana) that can be done seperately:1. Foundation Flow - approx 14 min, Shiva starts with some breathing exercises on a rock near a beautiful waterfall and continues with simple poses like cat , cobra and some variations.2. Beginner's Backbend Flow -approx. 20 min, there is a change of scenery and Shiva is in a beautiful garden with a lot of trees near a lake.It is actually mainly standing poses - she prepares you for backbends in this practice with some lunge variations , chair with twists ,side bends, half splits and cobra variations and finally bow and camel. This segment might be quite challenging for true beginners but she shows easier modifications for most of the poses so it's definitely doable.3.Relaxing Flexibility Flow - approx. 10 min , Shiva does simple stretches on the back , very similar to ""supine poses"" segment in Yoga Shakti it ends with a forward bend (badhakonasana) , it was very relaxing.4. Beginner's Standing Pose Flow - approx 23 min . now she's at the beach , the clip from Amazon is taken from this segment and it is dark here too not just in the clip , it was probably shot at dusk. This is really a seperate practice cuz there is no sense of getting up for another energizing practice after the relaxing segment. It is a more challenging vinyasa that includes warrior 2 variations and some more backbends.Too bad there is no matrix , because this segment is just stuck between the previous segments and the savasana ,it would be nice to do it before or after the second segment but since there are only a few chapters I guess it's not such a big deal to skip between them with the remote.This segment also ends with a very short savasana , barely 2 minutes, which is another minor complaint but all in all I really enjoyed this practice and felt really stretched out , I can't wait for her next DVD's to come out.",5,Flow Yoga For Everyone,1208304000,"04 16, 2008",2008,2159,"['was', 'so', 'glad', 'get', 'new', 'Shiva', 'DVD', 'less', '5', 'months', 'last', 'one', 'DVD', 'was', 'filmed', 'Kauai', 'Hawaii', 'as', 'well', 'next', 'DVD', 'be', 'released', 'year', 'next', 'year', 'practice', 'aimed', 'beginners', 'everyone', 'can', 'enjoy', 'whole', 'DVD', '70', 'minutes', '4', 'segments', 'savasana', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'seperately:1', 'Foundation', 'Flow', 'approx', '14', 'min', 'Shiva', 'breathing', 'exercises', 'rock', 'beautiful', 'waterfall', 'simple', 'poses', 'cat', 'cobra', 'variations.2', 'Beginner', 'Backbend', 'Flow', '-approx', '20', 'min', 'change', 'scenery', 'Shiva', 'beautiful', 'garden', 'lot', 'trees', 'lake.It', 'actually', 'mainly', 'standing', 'poses', 'backbends', 'practice', 'lunge', 'variations', 'chair', 'twists', 'side', 'bends', 'half', 'splits', 'cobra', 'variations', 'finally', 'bow', 'camel', 'segment', 'might', 'be', 'quite', 'challenging', 'true', 'beginners', 'easier', 'modifications', 'most', 'poses', 'definitely', 'doable.3.Relaxing', 'Flexibility', 'Flow', 'approx', '10', 'min', 'Shiva', 'simple', 'stretches', 'back', 'very', 'similar', 'supine', 'poses', 'segment', 'Yoga', 'Shakti', 'forward', 'bend', 'badhakonasana', 'was', 'very', 'relaxing.4', 'Beginner', 'Standing', 'Pose', 'Flow', 'approx', '23', 'min', 'now', 'beach', 'clip', 'Amazon', 'taken', 'segment', 'dark', 'here', 'too', 'not', 'just', 'clip', 'was', 'probably', 'shot', 'dusk', 'really', 'seperate', 'practice', 'cuz', 'sense', 'getting', 'up', 'energizing', 'practice', 'relaxing', 'segment', 'more', 'challenging', 'vinyasa', 'warrior', '2', 'variations', 'more', 'backbends.Too', 'bad', 'matrix', 'segment', 'just', 'stuck', 'previous', 'segments', 'savasana', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'do', 'second', 'segment', 'are', 'only', 'few', 'chapters', 'guess', 'not', 'such', 'big', 'deal', 'skip', 'remote.This', 'segment', 'also', 'very', 'short', 'savasana', 'barely', '2', 'minutes', 'minor', 'complaint', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'practice', 'felt', 'really', 'stretched', 'out', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'next', 'DVD', 'come', 'out']",Shiva Rea: Flow Yoga for Beginners
