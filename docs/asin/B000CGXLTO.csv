It was a little bit predictable (except for maybe one part... I won't spoil it for you).  Nikki Deloach (from the New Mickey Mouse Club and the former music group Innosense) did an ok job with acting.  I guess all in all the movie was just kind of so-so and bland where it should have been more exciting and suspenseful.  Putting the Sandra Bullock version of ""The Net"" in a different setting (Istanbul) doesn't really change the movie all that much.  Still the same basic plot: people steal someone's identity that doesn't have any family or friends to vouch for who she is.  You didn't feel anything for any of the characters in the movie.

She needs a change; needs something different, something very exciting. Nikki flies to Turkey, leaving her reluctant boyfriend behind, and there she is wrongly accused of the murders by the local authority.`The Net: 2.0"" uses so many clich&eacute;d narrative and visual techniques taken from other better thrillers including its original: flashbacks, voiceovers, fast-forwards and jump-cuts, mysterious (and unreliable) strangers, stolen IDs and high-tech machines. Director Charles Winkler gives bits of car chase here, hand-to-hand fights there, and some tricks using James Bond-like hand-made gadgets in between.Still we are not excited at all. But how can we? The film totally forgets to explain certain important things. Why doesn't she just phone someone in the US? Being a computer expert who actually meets clients, Nikki must know someone who can help her. How was the money withdrawn from her bank account? And most of all, as to the mastermind of this conspiracy, why not bribe her (or someone else) instead of preparing intricate setups?`The Net 2:0"" shows several great aerial shots and beautiful landscapes of the city. the detailed shots of the streets and buildings of the city are in fact much better than the main plot and character themselves.",2,"""The Net 2.0"": Updated with Recycled Materials",1170374400,"02 2, 2007",2007,1637,"['greatest', 'thing', 'Net', '2.0', 'location', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'Turkey', 'entirely', 'HD', 'video', 'city', 'Istanbul', 'very', 'colorful', 'exotic', 'backdrop', 'story', 'just', 'predictable', 'often', 'impossible', 'not', 'very', 'thrilling.The', 'film', 'American', 'computer', 'security', 'expert', 'Nikki', 'Cassidy', 'Nikki', 'Deloach', 'who', 'new', 'job', 'Istanbul', 'change', 'something', 'different', 'something', 'very', 'exciting', 'Nikki', 'Turkey', 'leaving', 'reluctant', 'boyfriend', 'wrongly', 'accused', 'murders', 'local', 'authority.', 'Net', '2.0', 'uses', 'so', 'many', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'narrative', 'visual', 'techniques', 'taken', 'other', 'better', 'thrillers', 'including', 'original', 'flashbacks', 'voiceovers', 'fast-forwards', 'jump-cuts', 'mysterious', 'unreliable', 'strangers', 'stolen', 'IDs', 'high-tech', 'machines', 'Director', 'Charles', 'Winkler', 'bits', 'car', 'chase', 'here', 'hand-to-hand', 'fights', 'there', 'tricks', 'using', 'James', 'Bond-like', 'hand-made', 'gadgets', 'between.Still', 'are', 'not', 'excited', 'how', 'can', 'film', 'totally', 'explain', 'certain', 'important', 'things', 'Why', ""n't"", 'just', 'phone', 'someone', 'US', 'Being', 'computer', 'expert', 'who', 'actually', 'clients', 'Nikki', 'must', 'know', 'someone', 'who', 'can', 'help', 'How', 'was', 'money', 'withdrawn', 'bank', 'account', 'most', 'mastermind', 'conspiracy', 'why', 'not', 'bribe', 'someone', 'else', 'instead', 'preparing', 'intricate', 'setups', 'Net', '2:0', 'shows', 'several', 'great', 'aerial', 'shots', 'beautiful', 'landscapes', 'city', 'detailed', 'shots', 'streets', 'buildings', 'city', 'are', 'fact', 'much', 'better', 'main', 'plot', 'character']",N/A

And -- to let you know they are filming in a Moslem country -- the producers continually play the ritual call to prayer, or some Arabic music that the Turks don't even listen to.  When Hope is running, which she does for most of the movie, turn off the annoying pseudo-Arabic sound track.In the beginning of the movie, would you believe that 5 Turkish police chasing Hope -- and shooting at her -- cannot even come close to hitting her?  As a matter of fact, she is chased throughout this movie and people are shooting at her, without hitting her!  I mean, they are only 20 feet behind her!And the movie plot predictable -- and has been done better in other movies.  I kept asking myself why I am wasting time on this film?  It is not getting better.And then came the last 15 minutes of this movie.  Yeah, you don't see this coming.Force yourself to watch this movie.  You will walk away with a smile.",4,Read My Review First,1399420800,"05 7, 2014",2014,970,"['Yes', 'not', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'most', 'movie', 'really', 'let', 'know', 'are', 'filming', 'Moslem', 'country', 'producers', 'continually', 'play', 'ritual', 'call', 'prayer', 'Arabic', 'music', 'Turks', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'listen', 'When', 'Hope', 'running', 'most', 'movie', 'turn', 'off', 'annoying', 'pseudo-Arabic', 'sound', 'beginning', 'movie', 'would', 'believe', '5', 'Turkish', 'police', 'chasing', 'Hope', 'shooting', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'come', 'close', 'hitting', 'matter', 'fact', 'chased', 'movie', 'people', 'are', 'shooting', 'hitting', 'mean', 'are', 'only', '20', 'feet', 'movie', 'plot', 'predictable', 'been', 'done', 'better', 'other', 'movies', 'kept', 'asking', 'why', 'am', 'wasting', 'time', 'film', 'not', 'getting', 'better.And', 'then', 'came', 'last', '15', 'minutes', 'movie', 'Yeah', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming.Force', 'watch', 'movie', 'will', 'walk', 'away', 'smile']",N/A
