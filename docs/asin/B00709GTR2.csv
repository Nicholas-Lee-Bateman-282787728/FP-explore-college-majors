1523878,A3ANETCTMAN1NP,B00709GTR2,&#308;&#308;,"[7, 7]","This DVD has quickly become one of my favorites, however I do have to call it out on having false advertising.  On the front it clearly says ""perfect for beginners,"" and as other reviewers have said, that's not exactly true.  With that being said, this is still an intense workout that will definitely give you weight loss and a whole lot more.There's about a seven-minute warm up to start things off.  It may be what the producers thought was perfect for beginners, because it breaks down key steps of each dance style.  Mark Ballas and Kym Johnson, the instructors, really teach fundamentals of the first few steps they'll actually show you in the dance routine to come.  Was it a warm up?  Not really.  There's no stretching or anything that will particularly get you loose and ready to go.  After viewing this the first time, I now skip it and warm up with the beginning of one of the routines.SAMBA - 17 minutes - Kym leads Samba, and I think she does it very well.  This section is very bouncy and probably what I would call the intermediate part of the DVD.  If you're familiar with the Samba section from the olderDancing With the Stars - Cardio DanceDVD, then you'll recognize some of them here.  If you're completely new to Samba, Kym begins by teaching some very basic steps and kind of breaking them down for you.  Each move gets progressively more difficult with some of the final moves being a bit complicated and fast.  This (and every other) section is broken down into three parts: combo 1 (5 minutes), combo 2 (5 minutes), and combo 3/put it all together (5-7 minutes).  This format keeps viewers from getting bored and taking it from the top all the time.SALSA - 16 minutes - Mark joins Kym to teach the Salsa section, although they don't dance together; like the box says, no partner is needed.  For the most part, this is a very beginner=friendly section since the moves are relatively simple and compact.  I use this section as my warm up since I don't find that it spikes my heart rate that much.  Near the end, some VERY fast advanced steps are introduced, but before that time, each move is basic salsa that many people may have seen before if they've ever done Latin dancing.  Mark and Kym have good chemistry together and act cheesy but fun.  Kym is better as explaining each move while Mark is excellent at cuing.  It's also nice to see both the feminine approach to dance moves as opposed to the more masculine approach.SWING/JIVE - 15 minutes - Once again, the DVD case has a bit of false advertising; this segment is called Swing, but apart from the first five minutes, it's definitely Jive.  For those who don't know the difference, Jive is about 2x as fast as Swing.  While this means that this is an intense workout, it's again not very good for beginners.  In fact, I'd almost call this routine advanced.  Mark leads viewers through complicated, fast, and high impact choreography.  Get ready to kick, jump, and hop almost constantly for fifteen minutes.  If you've seen the Swing/Jive section onDancing with the Stars: Dance Off the Pounds, then this segment is very similar; the music is actually the same from that DVD, too.  If you've never done Swing or Jive before, then I can almost guarantee you will get lost and feel frustrated most of this segment.  It's a fantastic challenge; I'm in great shape and have difficulty finishing it.  It really makes the DVD a worthy purchase for advanced exercisers.There is no Cool Down, and that really disappointed me.  In any workout, a cool down is necessary to stretch muscles, prevent soreness/injure, and feel good.  I usually add a cool down from another DVD, but I really wish the producers had at least tacked on some stretching on the end.  Why does it seem so hard for the makers of this series to put both a warm up AND cool down on the same DVD?Overall, this DVD has a little something for everyone.  Salsa is (mostly) good for beginners, Samba is an excellent workout for intermediates, and Swing/Jive is a cardio challenge for advanced.  True, it's not 100% for beginners, but I like that each section is so diverse.  All of the moves are REAL dance moves and a blast to do; I never find myself getting bored with this DVD.  I recommend this DVD to mostly anyone with a word of caution to beginners: you may struggle with this DVD a bit at first.  However, if you're a fan of the show or ballroom dancing, this is a fun workout purchase for you to try.A preview clip from this DVD can be found at collagevideo(.)com.

1523881,A1KEK09ZA6J9P8,B00709GTR2,Colleen M. Schneider,"[29, 30]","I have tried about four of the Dancing with the Stars workouts but have only purchased, one, which was the Dancing with the Stars ""Dance Off the Pounds"".  Here's my take...Each I felt were well done, but it really depends on if you are a beginner, intermediate or advanced exerciser.The one dvd I do have is an intermediate/advanced workout.  I do have dance experience, I like a fast pace and I get bored easily and need to be challenged.  If you are looking for an easier one that I liked, the Latin Dance one with Cheryl Burke is a good one for a beginner.This dvd is good, depending on what you like.  Some of the basic moves you will use in each dance are outlined by your instructors, Kym Johnson & Mark Ballas in the 7 minute warm-up sequence.  I'm not sure I love the warm-up and the instruction in that section, but it is not a huge deal.  The three types of dances that you will do are the Samba (17 minutes), the Salsa (16 minutes) and the Jive/Swing (15 minutes).  The instruction is good and the slower segments are the first two segments.  Once you get to the Swing/Jive, Mark Ballas really shows you how to make the dance really become a fat burner.  This was by far my favorite.  I would say intermediate on the first two sections and intermediate/advanced on the last one if you are following Mark.  It is very fast paced in some sections.  I loved it but I am thinking for a beginner this might be an exercise in frustration.There is no cool-down at the end of the work-out, it just ends, which was different from the dvd I purchased.  I would recommend some hamstring stretches after just to keep things loose, but that is my opinion.If you have done the Dancing the Pounds off dvd then you will remember some of the swing steps as they are the same, the Suzy Q, the triple step and the rock step.  I was a little disappointed there until I saw Mark add in a few other steps and then saw them working together.  The music is exactly the same as the Dancing the Pounds off music.  Strange, but maybe that is the best music to teach by...who knows.Overall, I enjoyed it and am thinking about purchasing this one.  The samba/salsa is really fun and great for the abs and the swing/jive is great to keep the cardio up and to get you sweating.  As Mark will demonstrate you can really amp it up with making sure you have the swing/bounce and your knees really lifted on the steps.  He is a great instructor for this dance.So, if you are looking for a beginner work-out, I would not pick this one, try the Latin Dance first and you can work up to this one.  If you have enjoyed the Dance of the Pounds, you will probably like this one and it is fast enough to keep you a little more challenged.The workout goes quickly as for me dance feels more like fun and less like work.  Good instruction on the workouts and good pace overall.",4,A fun way to get a work-out.....,1331510400,"03 12, 2012",2012,2844,"['have', 'tried', 'four', 'Dancing', 'Stars', 'workouts', 'have', 'only', 'purchased', 'one', 'was', 'Dancing', 'Stars', 'Dance', 'Off', 'Pounds', 'Here', 'take', 'felt', 'were', 'well', 'done', 'really', 'are', 'beginner', 'intermediate', 'advanced', 'one', 'dvd', 'do', 'have', 'intermediate/advanced', 'workout', 'do', 'have', 'dance', 'experience', 'like', 'fast', 'pace', 'get', 'bored', 'easily', 'need', 'be', 'challenged', 'are', 'looking', 'easier', 'one', 'liked', 'Latin', 'Dance', 'one', 'Cheryl', 'Burke', 'good', 'one', 'beginner.This', 'dvd', 'good', 'depending', 'what', 'like', 'basic', 'moves', 'will', 'use', 'dance', 'are', 'outlined', 'instructors', 'Kym', 'Johnson', 'Mark', 'Ballas', '7', 'minute', 'warm-up', 'sequence', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'love', 'warm-up', 'instruction', 'section', 'not', 'huge', 'deal', 'three', 'types', 'dances', 'will', 'do', 'are', 'Samba', '17', 'minutes', 'Salsa', '16', 'minutes', 'Jive/Swing', '15', 'minutes', 'instruction', 'good', 'slower', 'segments', 'are', 'first', 'two', 'segments', 'Once', 'get', 'Swing/Jive', 'Mark', 'Ballas', 'really', 'how', 'make', 'dance', 'really', 'become', 'fat', 'burner', 'was', 'far', 'favorite', 'would', 'say', 'intermediate', 'first', 'two', 'sections', 'intermediate/advanced', 'last', 'one', 'are', 'following', 'Mark', 'very', 'fast', 'paced', 'sections', 'loved', 'am', 'thinking', 'beginner', 'might', 'be', 'exercise', 'frustration.There', 'cool-down', 'end', 'work-out', 'just', 'was', 'different', 'dvd', 'purchased', 'would', 'recommend', 'hamstring', 'stretches', 'just', 'keep', 'things', 'loose', 'opinion.If', 'have', 'done', 'Dancing', 'Pounds', 'off', 'dvd', 'then', 'will', 'remember', 'swing', 'steps', 'are', 'same', 'Suzy', 'Q', 'triple', 'step', 'rock', 'step', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'saw', 'Mark', 'add', 'few', 'other', 'steps', 'then', 'saw', 'working', 'together', 'music', 'exactly', 'same', 'Dancing', 'Pounds', 'off', 'music', 'Strange', 'maybe', 'best', 'music', 'teach', 'who', 'knows.Overall', 'enjoyed', 'am', 'thinking', 'purchasing', 'one', 'samba/salsa', 'really', 'fun', 'great', 'abs', 'swing/jive', 'great', 'keep', 'cardio', 'up', 'get', 'sweating', 'Mark', 'will', 'demonstrate', 'can', 'really', 'amp', 'up', 'making', 'sure', 'have', 'swing/bounce', 'knees', 'really', 'lifted', 'steps', 'great', 'instructor', 'dance.So', 'are', 'looking', 'beginner', 'work-out', 'would', 'not', 'pick', 'one', 'try', 'Latin', 'Dance', 'first', 'can', 'work', 'up', 'one', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'Dance', 'Pounds', 'will', 'probably', 'one', 'fast', 'enough', 'keep', 'little', 'more', 'challenged.The', 'workout', 'quickly', 'dance', 'feels', 'more', 'fun', 'less', 'work', 'Good', 'instruction', 'workouts', 'good', 'pace', 'overall']",Dancing With the Stars: Cardio Dance for Weight Loss

Thus, when we were given the chance to try out this DVD we jumped at it.  The DVD states that it is for beginners and there are parts that seem to be geared toward this level of dancer (like my wife and I), but as the DVD progresses, the main instructors keep moving quickly, so you really have to watch fast to understand all of the moves. We loved the different dances you could work on and get better at. I think my favorite thus far is the jive and my wife's is the samba. One thing that was missing from this DVD was a cool down, so you will need to find a way to cool down after the exercise routine.
