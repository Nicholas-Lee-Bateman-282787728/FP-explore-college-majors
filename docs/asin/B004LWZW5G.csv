1415924,AAZRWLML88IZK,B004LWZW5G,A kids review,"[11, 17]","Jonah Hill is currently riding high on his recent Best Support Actor nomination at the Academy Awards and the surprise success of his '80s reboot 21 Jump Street, but if we go back just a few months, we'll find The Sitter. The latest raunchy comedy from David Gordon Green, The Sitter stars Hill as a layabout who reluctantly takes a babysitting gig, only then to be lured to a party by the promise of sex from his girlfriend. A wild evening full of drugs, car theft, robbery, and more ensues, all with three young children in tow. I found little to like about the film, with its recycled plot contrivances, inappropriate humor, and what seems like a phoned-in performance from Hill himself.",1,The Sitter,1332288000,"03 21, 2012",2012,690,"['Jonah', 'Hill', 'currently', 'riding', 'high', 'recent', 'Best', 'Support', 'Actor', 'nomination', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'surprise', 'success', ""'80s"", 'reboot', '21', 'Jump', 'Street', 'go', 'back', 'just', 'few', 'months', ""'ll"", 'find', 'Sitter', 'latest', 'raunchy', 'comedy', 'David', 'Gordon', 'Green', 'Sitter', 'stars', 'Hill', 'layabout', 'who', 'reluctantly', 'babysitting', 'gig', 'only', 'then', 'be', 'lured', 'party', 'promise', 'sex', 'girlfriend', 'wild', 'evening', 'full', 'drugs', 'car', 'theft', 'robbery', 'more', 'ensues', 'three', 'young', 'children', 'tow', 'found', 'little', 'like', 'film', 'recycled', 'plot', 'contrivances', 'inappropriate', 'humor', 'what', 'phoned-in', 'performance', 'Hill']",The Sitter

1415932,A2582KMXLK2P06,B004LWZW5G,B. E Jackson,"[1, 2]","It's surprising to me there's so many negative reviews for the Sitter.  It's basically a continuation of a famous comedy babysitting movie from the 80's called the Adventures In Babysitting.  I was a huge fan of this movie back in the late 80's and watched it at least 4 or 5 times.  However the biggest difference is that the Sitter is WAY more crude.  Both the babysitter and the children themselves are responsible for constant inappropriate behavior.  Of the 3 kids, the girl is obsessed with looking mature, acting like an adult by wearing tons of make-up and speaking twice her age, the one boy is really secluded and has anxiety attacks all the time which makes him incredibly nervous around people, and the third kid likes to be a vicious (aka, pesky) silent assassin in a methodical and elaborate kind of way by blowing up toilets and bathrooms.  Together with the babysitter, several regrettable situations occur.What happens is that the babysitter (played by Jonah Hill) is talked into babysitting these kids one night, and when he receives a phone call from a woman who he believes is his girlfriend, he gets excited and decides to take the kids around town and basically goes on an adventure all the while finding himself in really unfortuate, embarrassing and hilarious situations that he has no control of.  The kids actually make the storytelling that much better.  To give one example, Jonah takes the little girl into the clothing section so she can try on clothes, however the women working there quickly become suspicious that a grown man is walking through a little girls clothing store thanks to several lines that would unintentionally imply that he's up to no good, so the women confront and question him about it.  Really clever and funny writing here.The way the babysitter connects with the kids near the end is a subtle touch of emotional honesty that I greatly admire, though it might appear tacky and out of place for others, I admit.  Overall, it's certainly not the Adventures In Babysitting from a comedy or storytelling perspective, but it's a decent film at any rate with a touch of offensive laughter here and there.",4,what a sitter,1348963200,"09 30, 2012",2012,2152,"['surprising', 'so', 'many', 'negative', 'reviews', 'Sitter', 'basically', 'continuation', 'famous', 'comedy', 'babysitting', 'movie', '80', 'called', 'Adventures', 'Babysitting', 'was', 'huge', 'fan', 'movie', 'back', 'late', '80', 'watched', 'least', '4', '5', 'times', 'However', 'biggest', 'difference', 'Sitter', 'WAY', 'more', 'crude', 'babysitter', 'children', 'are', 'responsible', 'constant', 'inappropriate', 'behavior', '3', 'kids', 'girl', 'obsessed', 'looking', 'mature', 'acting', 'adult', 'wearing', 'tons', 'make-up', 'speaking', 'twice', 'age', 'one', 'boy', 'really', 'secluded', 'anxiety', 'attacks', 'time', 'incredibly', 'nervous', 'people', 'third', 'kid', 'likes', 'be', 'vicious', 'aka', 'pesky', 'silent', 'assassin', 'methodical', 'elaborate', 'kind', 'way', 'blowing', 'up', 'toilets', 'bathrooms', 'Together', 'babysitter', 'several', 'regrettable', 'situations', 'happens', 'babysitter', 'played', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'talked', 'babysitting', 'kids', 'one', 'night', 'when', 'phone', 'call', 'woman', 'who', 'girlfriend', 'excited', 'take', 'kids', 'town', 'basically', 'adventure', 'while', 'finding', 'really', 'unfortuate', 'embarrassing', 'hilarious', 'situations', 'control', 'kids', 'actually', 'make', 'storytelling', 'much', 'better', 'give', 'one', 'example', 'Jonah', 'little', 'girl', 'clothing', 'section', 'can', 'try', 'clothes', 'however', 'women', 'working', 'there', 'quickly', 'become', 'suspicious', 'grown', 'man', 'walking', 'little', 'girls', 'clothing', 'store', 'thanks', 'several', 'lines', 'would', 'unintentionally', 'imply', 'up', 'good', 'women', 'confront', 'question', 'Really', 'clever', 'funny', 'writing', 'here.The', 'way', 'babysitter', 'kids', 'end', 'subtle', 'touch', 'emotional', 'honesty', 'greatly', 'admire', 'might', 'appear', 'tacky', 'place', 'others', 'admit', 'Overall', 'certainly', 'not', 'Adventures', 'Babysitting', 'comedy', 'storytelling', 'perspective', 'decent', 'film', 'rate', 'touch', 'offensive', 'laughter', 'here', 'there']",The Sitter

Sawin,"[5, 16]","So let's get this straight: The Sitter is about to be released featuring the round and portly Jonah Hill we've become familiar with over the years, but he's lost a considerable amount of weight and almost looks like a completely different person these days? That won't be confusing to some people at all. Truth be told, I liked Jonah Hill there for awhile. I laughed really hard at Superbad, Grandma's Boy was a lot better than it first let on, and Get Him to the Greek was pretty solid as well. Not to mention How to Train Your Dragon being spectacular. The problem is outside of films like Moneyball, Hill basically has Vince Vaughn syndrome and plays the exact same character in everything. It could come down to character acting, but it gets to the point where you see somebody do the same shtick a dozen times and you just want to see if they're capable of anything else. Director David Gordon Green is on the same boat. I keep hearing how solid his first directorial efforts are and Pineapple Express is one of the best R-rated comedies in recent years, but everything since has just been so disappointing. The Sitter won't be the film to shatter what you've come to expect from Jonah Hill and David Gordon Green either.You pretty much already know the basic story of the film: a guy who hates kids has to babysit three of them and everything you could possibly imagine to go wrong does in the worst ways imaginable. Blithe (Landry Bender) is a little girl who's obsessed with becoming a celebrity and just wants to go to clubs, dress up, wear make-up, drink and eat whatever famous people consume, and sing along to songs a girl her age probably shouldn't. Rodrigo (Kevin Hernandez) is the adopted kid of the family and likes to destroy things for no reason while having a particular fascination with cherry bombs. Then there's Slater (Max Records) who is convinced he can't function without the medication in his fanny pack since he thinks he's beyond repair.The Sitter becomes very predictable. The three kids constantly clash with their babysitter throughout the film until they eventually warm up to each other and go from there. Jonah Hill spits out a few semi-entertaining one-liners amongst all the mayhem. There are several weird bonding scenes between the kids and Noah though. Noah has a heart to heart talk with both Blithe and Slater, but Slater is the one to step in and try to set Rodrigo straight. The scenes come off as a little awkward because they feel kind of forced. There's a drug dealer named Karl (Sam Rockwell) chasing them and Noah is trying to get to a party to try and get lucky with his sort-of girlfriend Marisa (Ari Graynor). Would you take a time-out to make a kid feel better if you owed a drug dealer ten grand by midnight with your life on the line?The entire adventure becomes incredibly clich&eacute; and is basically an R-rated version of most of the babysitting movies you've seen previously. Despicable Me, Mr. Nanny, Bebe's Kids, and The Pacifier are probably a few that come to mind. This is another movie whose unrealistic qualities snowballed as it progressed. It continued to get more and more ludicrous as it went on. About halfway into the movie, most of the theater was in hysterics but the entire press row was just not laughing at all. Realizing this made me laugh harder than any material in the movie.The Sitter is just bad from all angles. It uses a recycled and overused storyline, isn't funny, is unrealistic, and is basically an embarrassment for all of those involved. How in the world did Sam Rockwell become a part of this and what the hell happened to David Gordon Green? The Sitter is the type of movie that lets you know several talented people are involved in the project and yet they still churn out run of the mill garbage to try and make a buck. This is hands down one of the worst movies of the year.",1,"Predictable, cliche, and unfunny",1323302400,"12 8, 2011",2011,3873,"['So', 'let', 'get', 'straight', 'Sitter', 'be', 'released', 'featuring', 'round', 'portly', 'Jonah', 'Hill', ""'ve"", 'become', 'familiar', 'years', 'lost', 'considerable', 'amount', 'weight', 'almost', 'looks', 'completely', 'different', 'person', 'days', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'confusing', 'people', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'liked', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'awhile', 'laughed', 'really', 'hard', 'Superbad', 'Grandma', 'Boy', 'was', 'lot', 'better', 'first', 'let', 'Get', 'Him', 'Greek', 'was', 'pretty', 'solid', 'as', 'well', 'Not', 'mention', 'How', 'Train', 'Dragon', 'being', 'spectacular', 'problem', 'films', 'Moneyball', 'Hill', 'basically', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'syndrome', 'exact', 'same', 'character', 'everything', 'could', 'come', 'down', 'character', 'acting', 'point', 'where', 'see', 'somebody', 'do', 'same', 'shtick', 'dozen', 'times', 'just', 'want', 'see', ""'re"", 'capable', 'anything', 'else', 'Director', 'David', 'Gordon', 'Green', 'same', 'boat', 'keep', 'hearing', 'how', 'solid', 'first', 'directorial', 'efforts', 'are', 'Pineapple', 'Express', 'one', 'best', 'R-rated', 'comedies', 'recent', 'years', 'everything', 'just', 'been', 'so', 'disappointing', 'Sitter', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'film', 'shatter', 'what', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'David', 'Gordon', 'Green', 'pretty', 'much', 'already', 'know', 'basic', 'story', 'film', 'guy', 'who', 'kids', 'babysit', 'three', 'everything', 'could', 'possibly', 'imagine', 'go', 'wrong', 'worst', 'ways', 'imaginable', 'Blithe', 'Landry', 'Bender', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'obsessed', 'becoming', 'celebrity', 'just', 'go', 'clubs', 'dress', 'up', 'make-up', 'drink', 'eat', 'famous', 'people', 'consume', 'sing', 'along', 'songs', 'girl', 'age', 'probably', 'should', ""n't"", 'Rodrigo', 'Kevin', 'Hernandez', 'adopted', 'kid', 'family', 'likes', 'destroy', 'things', 'reason', 'having', 'particular', 'fascination', 'cherry', 'bombs', 'Then', 'Slater', 'Max', 'Records', 'who', 'convinced', 'ca', ""n't"", 'function', 'medication', 'fanny', 'pack', 'repair.The', 'Sitter', 'very', 'predictable', 'three', 'kids', 'constantly', 'clash', 'babysitter', 'film', 'eventually', 'warm', 'up', 'other', 'go', 'there', 'Jonah', 'Hill', 'out', 'few', 'semi-entertaining', 'one-liners', 'mayhem', 'are', 'several', 'weird', 'bonding', 'scenes', 'kids', 'Noah', 'Noah', 'heart', 'heart', 'talk', 'Blithe', 'Slater', 'Slater', 'one', 'step', 'try', 'set', 'Rodrigo', 'straight', 'scenes', 'come', 'off', 'little', 'awkward', 'feel', 'kind', 'forced', 'drug', 'dealer', 'named', 'Karl', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'chasing', 'Noah', 'trying', 'get', 'party', 'try', 'get', 'lucky', 'sort-of', 'girlfriend', 'Marisa', 'Ari', 'Graynor', 'Would', 'take', 'time-out', 'make', 'kid', 'feel', 'better', 'owed', 'drug', 'dealer', 'ten', 'grand', 'midnight', 'life', 'line', 'entire', 'adventure', 'incredibly', 'clich', 'eacute', 'basically', 'R-rated', 'version', 'most', 'babysitting', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'previously', 'Despicable', 'Me', 'Mr.', 'Nanny', 'Bebe', 'Kids', 'Pacifier', 'are', 'probably', 'few', 'come', 'mind', 'movie', 'unrealistic', 'qualities', 'snowballed', 'progressed', 'continued', 'get', 'more', 'more', 'ludicrous', 'went', 'halfway', 'movie', 'most', 'theater', 'was', 'hysterics', 'entire', 'press', 'row', 'was', 'just', 'not', 'laughing', 'Realizing', 'made', 'harder', 'material', 'movie.The', 'Sitter', 'just', 'bad', 'angles', 'recycled', 'overused', 'storyline', ""n't"", 'funny', 'unrealistic', 'basically', 'embarrassment', 'involved', 'How', 'world', 'did', 'Sam', 'Rockwell', 'become', 'part', 'what', 'hell', 'happened', 'David', 'Gordon', 'Green', 'Sitter', 'type', 'movie', 'know', 'several', 'talented', 'people', 'are', 'involved', 'project', 'yet', 'still', 'churn', 'out', 'run', 'mill', 'garbage', 'try', 'make', 'buck', 'down', 'one', 'worst', 'movies', 'year']",The Sitter

It starts badly with Jonah Hill failing to get sex from his coke-addicted girlfriend and quickly scrapes right through the bottom of the barrel to rip off every babysitter film ever made.The three kids in the film are a collection of two-dimensional problems that make the adults look like Dickensian-crafted characters. The kid from Ecuador think he's from a cartel because - you know - he's South American. Floppy haired anxiety kid is coming to terms with being gay because that's such a great concept for comedy. And celebrity obsessed brat #3 is really annoying. The stereotypes don't stop there - there are some 'gangsta' black people who are really just cool folk in the end too.Around the end of Act 2 the film is forced to try to reconcile all these situations in some really terribly written scenes that show the kid from Ecuador should be more family oriented and less completely crazy, kid #2 should accept his sexuality (at 12 years old!) and kid #3 has to wipe off the excess make-up. Jonah meanwhile realizes his girlfriend has been using him and hooks up with an arbitrary friend from college who happens to be cocktailing.The basic problem with the film isn't the absurdity (The Hangover barely makes sense but is a great flick) - it's the fact that there isn't a single laugh in the whole movie. Sam Rockwell limps his way through this and somehow his thorough beating near the end seems out of key with a kid-focused comedy.

Ultimately, however, it ended up being a foul Adventures in Babysitting.

I laugh at things that make other people cringe and/or cry. But there just weren't a ton of laughs in this film about a slovenly slacker getting played by a female crackhead who wants him to bring drugs to a party, which just happens to put him - and the three kids he's ""babysitting"" - into all sorts of bizarre situations (e.g. car theft, street fights, shoplifting, drugs, toilet bombs). Adding in the loser bequeathed life-lessons just makes the movie sloppy when he's dealing with possibly offensive black and Hispanic stereotypes, forced sexual identity concepts that just added awkwardness to the film (side note: Max Records, who plays Slater, the psychiatrist's wet dream with sexual identity issues, is either a horrible actor or channeling Kristen Stewart. Either way, the fact the actor portraying the role didn't have the maturity required to tackle the complexity further validates the accusation of awkwardness.), and a little girl who is obviously used as a tongue-in-cheek shot at the reality-star generation (side note 2: The little girl in this role, Landry Bender, was actually quite cute and capable.) - it also doesn't help that Hill's transformative process feels unnatural. The shoe-horned love interest subplot was so painful I passed a kidney stone for relief.I have to admit I laughed more than one time, but I honestly can't remember the situations.

I've seen this movie get bashed by many so I went in with very low expectations (and 99 price didn't hurt much either). I was pleasantly surprised.I feel like the marketing made this out to be a hardcore, extremely raunchy comedy. It is an adult comedy but it isn't as extreme as some comedies out there. Actually, the story even mixes in some issues that kids have at a young age and has Jonah Hill tackling them in a (mostly) mature way. I thought it was a funny movie and it went by really fast, because it's short and thoroughly entertaining. The acting was fine.It was somewhat predictable and had slightly obvious ending, though. It may feel like you've seen this movie before because it doesn't do much to set itself apart from other ""bring-something-to-the-party-and-get-'rewarded'"" comedies.

1415971,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B004LWZW5G,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[1, 3]","The Sitter is the worst film of director David Gordon Green's career. In case this doesn't mean much to you, allow me to explain: With a slew of films starting in 2000, Green was on the fast-track to becoming one of America's great directors. In 2008, he branched into the mainstream with the well-received Pineapple Express. Since then, he has delivered two more films, Your Highness and The Sitter; both 2011 releases and both being the worst-reviewed films of his career. Because Your Highness was a passion project for Green and star Danny McBride, I don't fault him for this. The Sitter is just lazy however. Green has not ""sold out,"" having been vocal about wanting to balance his more personal projects with films he enjoyed as a kid. There's nothing wrong with having fun and getting a substantial paycheck that could make it easier for him to make those films he's passionate about. What's wrong is when a director with this much talent attaches his name to a project this mediocre. The Sitter boasts a phenomenal director and a talented star, but is bogged down by lazy, repetitive humor and a lack of coherent writing. It's entertaining if you shut your brain off, but at what cost?The plot instantly brings to mind the 80s cult classic Adventures in Babysitting, at least, I assume it does considering that was the first film that came to my mind and I haven't seen a frame of it since the late 90s. Jonah Hill, in his final pre-weight loss role, plays Noah Griffith, a college student on suspension roped into babysitting as a favor to his mom. Since this is a comedy, the children must fall into a specific archetype so they can effectively wreak havoc. There is the neurotic, stern Slater (Max Records from Where the Wild Things Are), the makeup obsessed Blithe (Landry Bender), and the adopted, pyromaniac Rodrigo (Kevin Hernandez). While the children begin misbehaving and destroying everything in sight, Noah gets a call from his girlfriend Marisa (Ari Graynor) who says she'll finally sleep with him if he acquires cocaine and brings it to her. Noah and the children pile into a minivan and set off into the night where he'll encounter psychotic drug dealers, gangs, and a mounting wave of stress.The script by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka follows an episodic template with each new situation getting Noah into more trouble. The plot is recycled and follows a predictable formula, but it's the disconnection between everything that presents the biggest problem. This doesn't feel like a tight, cohesive story but a loose collection of scenes thrown together to create a whole. There's little consistency in the way each scene flows into the next and the script could have benefitted from an additional draft. I doubt the writing was a top priority for anyone involved though. As for the jokes, it may be unfair but I assume the best ones were improvised. I will not apologize or excuse myself for laughing when a valet tells Noah that he's lost his car and Noah responds ""You didn't lose your Morrissey boxset,"" nor will I deny that I chuckled maniacally when Noah tells a character he's ""as queer as a football bat."" The movie has a darker tone than the average mainstream comedy, but seems almost uncomfortable and never really follows through with it. You remember how 80s films of this sort would get pretty dark (Adventures in Babysitting, for example, was pretty dark)? The Sitter seems unwilling to fully make that commitment, probably due to the choppiness of the script.Without the talent involved, all of whom likely made the film more watchable, this could easily be a direct-to-DVD release and it's a sad day that a film directed by David Gordon Green can be labeled ""amateurish."" I admit I laughed a few times and was never bored watching it, but there's nothing smart or original about The Sitter. What's worse is that the movie has its share of gross-out, double-digit IQ humor that is both unfunny and completely beneath Green as a director. Hill's mounting frustrations dealing with the over exaggerated, devilish children can only keep a movie up and running for so long. On the positive side, the child actors do a fine job and are actually pretty funny. That's more than I can say for the obnoxious, unfunny children in the Adam Sandler-vehicle Just Go with It from earlier this year.There's nothing pretentious about The Sitter and I'm sure Green was aware it was his worst film while making it. Everyone involved here simply wanted to have fun, get a paycheck, and go home. No one in the target audience for this will be turned off by what they discover herein. The biggest failure of The Sitter is how disappointing it turned out with the people involved. I know Green still has it in him to make a film that will redeem his recent output but I hope it's sooner rather than later. This film would have been disappointing with Brett Ratner directing it; Green's involvement pours salt in the wound.",3,2 1/2 Stars.

1415975,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B004LWZW5G,MadMacs,"[1, 5]","Getting tired of paying to screen Director David Gordon Green's efforts.Personally, I have learn to avoid anything to do with three-named people. In my experience, they generally fall into two basic camps: Pretentious Egotists or Serial Killers. Besides the screenwriting team, I'm hoping no one disappeared during the making of this moronic production. As to the former - there is no hole deep enough. In reaching for clever and raunchy, they only succeeding in bungling their way to unfortunate and embarrassing.Proof positive that shallow superciliousness will only carry you so far. 'Pineapple Express' was my first DGG film and I thought, ""Wow, this guy is the Mel Brooks of his generation."" Now after three movie disasters, including this shoddy pile, I recognize that he's actually baseball player Brady Anderson.Remember him? Probably not. In 1996 he hit an astounding 50 home runs. He never hit more than 21 before that one season and no more than 24 throughout his career afterwards.A fluke.Just like 'Pineapple Express'. Sometimes you just get lucky, it happens. But luck always runs out. And unless you have real talent, there's nothing to fall back on.Sadly, just as you're almost drawn into Noah as he connects with his youthful charges, those sympathetic moments are completely buried; because as a viewer you no longer care. Having being smacked up the side the noggin' with the imbecilic plot and its fumbling adolescent attempts at being funny, you're too numb to engage. It borders on tragedy because there's a tender strength in lead actor Jonah Hill that comes through when he's in the right vehicle.Listed as a comedy. But unless you're 15 years old, it takes considerable effort for this to be in any way construed as comedic.Personal Note: I'm not a fan of Sam Rockwell.

I'll admit that when I was younger to hear someone drop the F bomb would stun me. But in today's world with today's films it's become rather pass&eacute;.Jonah Hill, who took a step forward when he went from the crude teen comedies he was making to star in MONEYBALL, takes two steps back with THE SITTER. Hill stars as Noah Griffith, a loser who lives with his mother, has no future planned and would rather be stoned than anything in the world. With the exception of having Marisa as his girlfriend. Marisa uses Noah for oral sex and nothing else, leading him to believe they have a connection when in truth she lusts after the local MMA star.Wanting the best for his mother, Noah agrees to baby sit for her best friend while she goes out on a date that has bright prospects. Of course the kids are far from normal. Slater is a psychiatrist dream with so many problems that he can't think straight. Blithe is a wanna be celebrity elementary schooler. And that leaves Rodrigo, the adopted son of the family who has a penchant for blowing things up.Noah gets a call from Marisa while sitting: pick up some cocaine and rush over to a party she's at and she might have sex with him. Being the responsible sitter he is, Noah packs the kids in the car and off they go to find the money to buy drugs and then deliver them.Of course they end up doing nearly everything but with adventures involving robbing Noah's father's diamond business, dropping into an all black bar and running afoul of the drug dealer when Rodrigo steals a large plastic egg filled with drugs. The dealer gives Noah a few hours to recover the drugs or the money.If you think this sounds like a twisted version of the classic ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING, you'd be right. But unlike that movie which had more than its share of funny situations and laughs, this movie relies on the lowest common denominator of jokes to attempt to squeeze jokes out. And it fails almost every time.While I watched I kept hoping that funny things would happen. There were a few rare occasions when they did but those were short lived. Instead I got more of the foul language in front of kids (or used by kids, something Hollywood thinks is funny these days) and references to drugs and sex that helped to create the worst years in the history of SNL, that period of time which never makes it to reruns on any channel.  These items are not funny just because you toss a lame joke at them.Late in the movie Noah suddenly seems to care about the kids he's watching. But it comes far too late and out of nowhere. The entire time he spends with these kids at first seems like he's there to earn some money and help his mom. Before a few hours are over, he suddenly wants to help these kids find their place in life, something even he hasn't achieved. Not only does it make an unbelievable situation, it makes the film seem more awkward than helpful.Hill has made better movies in this genre, some that are even funny.

However, this movie is not your typical Jonah Hill flick.  Jonah stars as Noah, a college dropout with nothing on his plate.  Noah is volunteered by his mother to babysit for her friends so she can go out and meet a potential lover.  The three kids Noah has to babysit are a proverbial nightmare.  You have the middle schooler who's addicted to anti-anxiety medication, the six year old who wants to be a popular socialite and the middle school aged, South American foster child who likes to play with explosives.  Noah must take these kids into the city to buy his girlfriend some drugs, and the movie goes from there.The twist and turns this movie throws are completely uncharted, and are not easy to see coming.

I am not a huge fan of comedies, in fact, most of the films people consider to be the funniest movies of all time, I didn't like. Hill's films are one of the exceptions. I have to see every movie he is in because he is truly hysterical and makes everything he is in exceptional. The sitter didn't have a very strong plot, but it was a hysterical movie that worked because of Hill. Everyone around him just follows his lead and plays off his energy and it was evident here. Hill along with three kids he's babysitting go on an unbelievable and hysterical adventure in NYC. It's one of those films you don't believe and that initial comes across as stupid, but it's also a film you can't stop watching because you want to see what happens next.
