1390317,A3TLO8ZZK3H29Z,B004A1ZWMQ,"R. Saylor ""Love4magic""","[5, 8]","There are clearly other opinions about this disc, but (and just my opinion) they seem to be missing the most important point... This disc contains the Best 3D nature footage released on Blu-ray to date.  Branches hang well into your livingroom while long rows of forest life extend deep into the distance.  There is huge depth in this footage.  And that, to me, is the goal of the Blu-ray 3D format.Now, regarding the question of is this a ""Blu-ray 3D"" disc?  The answer is YES.  There are multiple modes within the Blu-ray 3D format: a checkered board 3D, above/below 3D (which is what is included on this disc) and side-by-side 3D.  The checkered board format is the best and used most of commonly in Blu-ray 3D releases, but the others also look great on a quality HDTV.  The Cable companies, as they make the services available, use the above/below 3D and side-by-side 3D in their 3D Cable channels and 3D On-Demand channels.  And, there are a couple of Japanese Blu-ray 3D titles that boast that they have the side-by-side mode.  Just make sure that your HDTV supports the various modes, and you're good to go.  All modes will work with your new 3D glasses and 3d Blu-ray player.There is one other thing you should know.  This disc is a BD-R and not a BD disc.  Not too big of a deal because Most (maybe all) Blu-ray players now play BD-R's without a second thought.  The surprise is, with it being a BD-R, it has the look of a back-up copy instead of an original product.  Just worth mentioning.Hope that clears up some ""stuff"".  Anyway, that's it.  If you are looking to show off the depth of your 3D HDTV, this is a good disc to check out.
