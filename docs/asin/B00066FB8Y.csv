861605,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00066FB8Y,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","With a slew of big names, a number of hilarious performances, endless glitz and glamour and a story that is funny and engaging, `What a Way to Go!' was a lot better than I personally expected.  I love everyone in the cast, but the film and premise just had `throw away comedy' written all over it, and so I watched it mainly because of my personally obsessions with Shirley MacLaine and Paul `greatest actor ever' Newman.I was pleasantly surprised.The film is not a perfect comedy, and it surely has its faults (the script can drift into corny more often than not) but it is delightful and entertaining and well worth a watch through, maybe even multiple ones.Shirley MacLaine plays Louisa May Foster, a young poor girl whose life is turned upside down when she rejects the affections of local rich boy Leonard Crawley, choosing to cast materialism aside and live poorly with Edgar Hopper.  That decision seemed perfect for her, but when Hopper catches the `money making' bug she realizes that materialism is something she just cannot escape.Told in flashbacks as Louisa recounts her multiple marriages to her shrink, `What a Way to Go!' has a lot going on.  After Hopper's untimely death Louisa marries a bohemian painter, and then a washed up dancer, and then a millionaire (figuring if he already has the money then he won't die trying to make it) and so on.  Each and every storyline is accompanied by a new set of problems and a flashy style in which Louisa tells it (I absolutely adore the throwbacks to silent film or foreign classics).  `What a Way to Go!' is colorful and vibrant and full of energy, and the performances almost all compliment the films tone.Shirley is a delight here, a comedic gem and a very beautiful and engaging actress.  She does tend to take a backseat though, to her many male costars.  They make so much of their limited time that we wind up focusing on them over her.  Paul Newman was my personal favorite; his carefree charm and comedic charisma light up every frame.  Robert Mitchum was also very good as the Howard Hughesesque millionaire, and Gene Kelly sizzles as dancer Pinky Benson.  I particularly adored Dick Van Dyke's portrayal of Edgar.  He played to his newfound obsession with marvelous physicality.  I was less impressed with Dean Martin than I was with anybody else.  I just didn't find him charming in the least.  I actually found him rather dull, which was maybe the point, but then again, I don't think it was.Alas, a few minor faults (there are some jokes that don't land very well, and the film can seem to repeat itself and or drag a little by the tale end) won't prevent me from recommending this film.  I'll surely watch it again, for it has a lot going for it.",4,"One kooky, charming, delightful good time...",1241136000,"05 1, 2009",2009,2720,"['slew', 'big', 'names', 'number', 'hilarious', 'performances', 'endless', 'glitz', 'glamour', 'story', 'funny', 'engaging', 'What', 'Way', 'Go', 'was', 'lot', 'better', 'personally', 'expected', 'love', 'everyone', 'cast', 'film', 'premise', 'just', 'had', 'throw', 'away', 'comedy', 'written', 'so', 'watched', 'mainly', 'personally', 'obsessions', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'Paul', 'greatest', 'actor', 'ever', 'Newman.I', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised.The', 'film', 'not', 'perfect', 'comedy', 'surely', 'faults', 'script', 'can', 'drift', 'corny', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'delightful', 'entertaining', 'well', 'watch', 'maybe', 'even', 'multiple', 'ones.Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'plays', 'Louisa', 'May', 'Foster', 'young', 'poor', 'girl', 'life', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'when', 'affections', 'local', 'rich', 'boy', 'Leonard', 'Crawley', 'choosing', 'cast', 'materialism', 'aside', 'live', 'poorly', 'Edgar', 'Hopper', 'decision', 'seemed', 'perfect', 'when', 'Hopper', 'money', 'making', 'bug', 'materialism', 'something', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'escape.Told', 'flashbacks', 'Louisa', 'multiple', 'marriages', 'shrink', 'What', 'Way', 'Go', 'lot', 'going', 'Hopper', 'untimely', 'death', 'Louisa', 'bohemian', 'painter', 'then', 'washed', 'up', 'dancer', 'then', 'millionaire', 'figuring', 'already', 'money', 'then', 'wo', ""n't"", 'die', 'trying', 'make', 'so', 'storyline', 'accompanied', 'new', 'set', 'problems', 'flashy', 'style', 'Louisa', 'absolutely', 'adore', 'throwbacks', 'silent', 'film', 'foreign', 'classics', 'What', 'Way', 'Go', 'colorful', 'vibrant', 'full', 'energy', 'performances', 'almost', 'compliment', 'films', 'tone.Shirley', 'delight', 'here', 'comedic', 'gem', 'very', 'beautiful', 'engaging', 'actress', 'tend', 'take', 'backseat', 'many', 'male', 'costars', 'make', 'so', 'much', 'limited', 'time', 'wind', 'up', 'focusing', 'over', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'was', 'personal', 'favorite', 'carefree', 'charm', 'comedic', 'charisma', 'light', 'up', 'frame', 'Robert', 'Mitchum', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'Howard', 'Hughesesque', 'millionaire', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'dancer', 'Pinky', 'Benson', 'particularly', 'adored', 'Dick', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'portrayal', 'Edgar', 'played', 'newfound', 'obsession', 'marvelous', 'physicality', 'was', 'less', 'impressed', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'was', 'anybody', 'else', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'charming', 'least', 'actually', 'found', 'rather', 'dull', 'was', 'maybe', 'point', 'then', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'few', 'minor', 'faults', 'are', 'jokes', 'do', ""n't"", 'land', 'very', 'well', 'film', 'can', 'seem', 'repeat', 'drag', 'little', 'tale', 'end', 'wo', ""n't"", 'prevent', 'recommending', 'film', ""'ll"", 'surely', 'watch', 'again', 'lot', 'going']",N/A

861609,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B00066FB8Y,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[16, 17]","""What a Way to Go!"" is such an entertaining showcase of vivacious star Shirley MacLaine's talents as a comedienne, dancer, and singer that it's hard to believe that the original script was far darker, and intended for Marilyn Monroe!A tale of an innocent who dreams of a 'simple life', marrying progressively richer men who leave her an ever richer widow, is the kind of tongue-in-cheek farce that European filmmakers relish, but was unfamiliar to American audiences of the early sixties. Writer Gwen Davis' original story was written to satirically echo Monroe's own marital misadventures, and might have provided the star her best vehicle since ""Bus Stop"". But Monroe's career took a tragic nosedive, culminating with her death, at 36, in 1962, leaving Fox with a script, a director (J. Lee Thompson), and a film in preproduction.Gifted songwriting team Betty Comden and Adolph Green, fresh from transferring their B'way hit, ""Bells Are Ringing"" to the screen, saw the script, and were invited to rework it as a comic vehicle for MacLaine. The talented actress, who had achieved major stardom in ""The Apartment"", was being given a major build-up by Fox, who wanted to showcase her untapped skills as singer/dancer, as well as in comedy. Thus a lighter, more dazzling ""What a Way to Go!"" was born.Fox spared no expense on the production, with over 70 Edith Head costumes, choreography by Gene Kelly, and a new song by Jule Styne...but they balked over Frank Sinatra's salary demands, to play one of the husbands (he was replaced by Robert Mitchum). For MacLaine, it was a joy, working with two ex-lovers (Mitchum and Dean Martin), dancing with Kelly, doing comedy with Dick Van Dyke, Bob Cummings, and a surprisingly deft Paul Newman, and working with legendary Marx Brothers' foil, Margaret Dumont, in her last film.The end result, while a 'mixed bag', has memorable moments; Newman's French sequence, with a chimp and a murderous painting machine, captures the 'essence' of the material very well; the spoof of Fox multi-costume extravaganzas, with Mitchum, is dazzling (and his death is the funniest); best of all, the giant musical production number with Kelly and MacLaine is a total joy, a homage to both Kelly and Busby Berkeley. While the Van Dyke and Martin sequences lack the same sparkle, and Cumming's scenes appear more contrived than funny, the overall result is wonderful eye candy, with MacLaine never sexier, or more energetic. That the film failed to become a big hit when released was certainly not due to it's star.The new DVD edition deserves a commentary and 'making of' documentary (neither of which it has), but does offer some entertaining newsreel footage from the 1964 World's Fair premiere, as well as an amusing newsreel of the casting of the chimp for the Newman sequence.""What a Way to Go!"" may not be 'classic' cinema, but it is fun, and if you're a MacLaine fan, you'll be in for a treat!",4,"Opulent, Frothy Showcase for MacLaine and her Men!",1120780800,"07 8, 2005",2005,2922,"['What', 'Way', 'Go', 'entertaining', 'showcase', 'vivacious', 'star', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'talents', 'comedienne', 'dancer', 'singer', 'hard', 'believe', 'original', 'script', 'was', 'far', 'darker', 'intended', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'A', 'tale', 'innocent', 'who', ""'simple"", 'life', 'marrying', 'progressively', 'richer', 'men', 'who', 'leave', 'ever', 'richer', 'widow', 'kind', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'farce', 'European', 'filmmakers', 'relish', 'was', 'unfamiliar', 'American', 'audiences', 'early', 'sixties', 'Writer', 'Gwen', 'Davis', 'original', 'story', 'was', 'written', 'satirically', 'echo', 'Monroe', 'own', 'marital', 'misadventures', 'might', 'have', 'provided', 'star', 'best', 'vehicle', 'Bus', 'Stop', 'Monroe', 'career', 'took', 'tragic', 'nosedive', 'culminating', 'death', '36', '1962', 'leaving', 'Fox', 'script', 'director', 'J.', 'Lee', 'Thompson', 'film', 'preproduction.Gifted', 'songwriting', 'team', 'Betty', 'Comden', 'Adolph', 'Green', 'fresh', 'transferring', ""B'way"", 'hit', 'Bells', 'Are', 'Ringing', 'screen', 'saw', 'script', 'were', 'invited', 'rework', 'comic', 'vehicle', 'MacLaine', 'talented', 'actress', 'who', 'had', 'achieved', 'major', 'stardom', 'Apartment', 'was', 'being', 'given', 'major', 'build-up', 'Fox', 'who', 'wanted', 'showcase', 'untapped', 'skills', 'singer/dancer', 'as', 'well', 'comedy', 'Thus', 'lighter', 'more', 'dazzling', 'What', 'Way', 'Go', 'was', 'born.Fox', 'spared', 'expense', 'production', '70', 'Edith', 'Head', 'costumes', 'choreography', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'new', 'song', 'Jule', 'Styne', 'balked', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'salary', 'demands', 'play', 'one', 'husbands', 'was', 'replaced', 'Robert', 'Mitchum', 'MacLaine', 'was', 'joy', 'working', 'two', 'ex-lovers', 'Mitchum', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'dancing', 'Kelly', 'doing', 'comedy', 'Dick', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'Bob', 'Cummings', 'surprisingly', 'deft', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'working', 'legendary', 'Marx', 'Brothers', 'foil', 'Margaret', 'Dumont', 'last', 'film.The', 'end', 'result', ""'mixed"", 'bag', 'memorable', 'moments', 'Newman', 'French', 'sequence', 'chimp', 'murderous', 'painting', 'machine', ""'essence"", 'material', 'very', 'well', 'spoof', 'Fox', 'multi-costume', 'extravaganzas', 'Mitchum', 'dazzling', 'death', 'funniest', 'best', 'giant', 'musical', 'production', 'number', 'Kelly', 'MacLaine', 'total', 'joy', 'homage', 'Kelly', 'Busby', 'Berkeley', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'Martin', 'sequences', 'lack', 'same', 'sparkle', 'Cumming', 'scenes', 'appear', 'more', 'contrived', 'funny', 'overall', 'result', 'wonderful', 'eye', 'candy', 'MacLaine', 'never', 'sexier', 'more', 'energetic', 'film', 'failed', 'become', 'big', 'hit', 'when', 'released', 'was', 'certainly', 'not', 'due', 'star.The', 'new', 'DVD', 'edition', 'commentary', ""'making"", 'documentary', 'offer', 'entertaining', 'newsreel', 'footage', '1964', 'World', 'Fair', 'premiere', 'as', 'well', 'amusing', 'newsreel', 'casting', 'chimp', 'Newman', 'sequence', 'What', 'Way', 'Go', 'may', 'not', 'be', ""'classic"", 'cinema', 'fun', ""'re"", 'MacLaine', 'fan', ""'ll"", 'be', 'treat']",N/A

Add to this a big budget, the most outrageous costumes of an outrageous era, and a witty script by Comden and Green that blends romance, satire, slapstick and just a pinch of cynicism. It's big and overblown and all the better for it. And I'm glad to report that it looks fantastic on this dvd in widescreen and vibrant color.Shirley MacLaine made several screwball comedies in the 60's such as Woman Times Seven, John Goldfarb Please Come Home, and The Bliss Of Mrs Blossom, but What A Way To Go is one of the best. She is helped immeasurably by a galaxy of stars portraying the men in her life - smooth and oily Dean Martin, rubber-faced and loose-limbed Dick Van Dyke, bearded and self-spoofing Paul Newman, surprisingly charming Robert Mitchum, the always delightful Gene Kelly, and a somewhat manic Robert Cummings. As an added treat, the Marx Brothers' old foil Margaret Dumont is wonderfully over-the-top as MacLaine's dragon of a mother. You just don't get casts like that anymore.Another nice touch is the way several genres of film are spoofed as MacLaine wistfully recalls the best days of each of her marriages. The musical extravaganza with Gene Kelly, in particular, is a real joy. Kelly was over 50 but still had all the moves while MacLaine reminds us what a fantastic dancer she was - with equally fantastic legs. I also loved Paul Newman as the world-weary abstract artist. Many people forget that he made a number of comedies way back when, and that he was pretty good in them.What A Way To Go was not a big hit when it was released, primarily because it was made at a time when the emphasis was on youth and this film was seen as an instant relic that would appeal only to the Doris Day/Rock Hudson crowd. How wrong they were. Forty years on, What A Way To Go is still fresh and funny, unlike many other Swinging 60's comedies.Other reviewers on here have mentioned films they would like to see released on dvd. I'll add an old, little-seen favorite of mine - The Art Of Love with James Garner and Dick Van Dyke. Well, I can hope, can't I?

Such is the case with this 1964 extravaganza, the kind of overdone product that brought many of the major studios to their knees in the sixties. At the time, Shirley MacLaine was a top big screen draw, having graduated from her earlier pixyish waifs. She portrays Louisa May Foster Hopper Flint Anderson Benson, a four times-married, four-times-widowed woman who became exponentially wealthier with each marriage. But instead of playing the black widow angle, screenwriters Betty Comden and Adolph Green, most famous as songwriters but also for their scripts for classic MGM musicals like ""Singin' in the Rain"", manage an inordinate, bumptious mix of black comedy and slapstick in having Louisa tell her story as a flashback to a psychiatrist who inevitably falls in love with her.The mastodon-sized movie is really just a one-joke premise translated into four different episodes that lead to the same tragicomic end. Dick Van Dyke plays Thoreau-loving idler Edgar Hopper, who becomes an unbearable workaholic turning his failing little store into a Wal-Mart-level conglomerate. Paul Newman plays brooding, impoverished expatriate artist Larry Flint, who invents a wacky machine that paints big canvases to music and then becomes the toast of Paris with his modern paintings. Robert Mitchum plays maple syrup tycoon Rod Anderson, already a multi-millionaire when he meets Louisa but wanting the simple life down on the farm. Gene Kelly plays third-rate entertainer Pinky Benson, who changes his nightclub act and changes into a megalomaniacal movie star. In each marriage, it is Louise who ironically triggers her husband's success and finds out over and over that money does not bring happiness. In the bookend part, Dean Martin plays the one that got away, the smug hometown playboy at the beginning and the beaten man near the end. A tireless MacLaine is game throughout, but her character's innate why-me innocence becomes increasingly exasperating.In what amounts to the movie's most clever parts, each marriage includes a mini-homage to a particular film genre - silent comedy with Edgar, sexy French films with Larry, elaborate mega-productions with Rod and of course, MGM musicals with Pinky. The Mitchum and Newman chapters are the most entertaining since both tweak their respective images sportingly. The Kelly segment is highlighted by a terrific shipboard musical number in which the leggy MacLaine gets to showcase her Broadway-trained dancing abilities next to the nimble Kelly. Lacking the finesse for this type of farce, J. Lee Thompson directs the proceedings with the subtlety of an army commando, not a surprise given that his biggest success was ""The Guns of Navarone"". And worse of all, it simply goes on and on. The legendary Edith Head must have had a field day designing MacLaine's series of elaborate costumes. It's definitely a curio from a bygone era.",3,Mega-Extravagant Silliness Has a Tireless MacLaine as a Why-Me Black Widow,1159228800,"09 26, 2006",2006,2984,"['movies', 'are', 'so', 'supremely', 'silly', 'are', 'worth', 'experiencing', 'once', 'just', 'sheer', 'giddiness', 'Such', 'case', '1964', 'extravaganza', 'kind', 'overdone', 'product', 'brought', 'many', 'major', 'studios', 'knees', 'sixties', 'time', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'was', 'top', 'big', 'screen', 'draw', 'having', 'graduated', 'earlier', 'pixyish', 'waifs', 'Louisa', 'May', 'Foster', 'Hopper', 'Flint', 'Anderson', 'Benson', 'four', 'times-married', 'four-times-widowed', 'woman', 'who', 'became', 'exponentially', 'wealthier', 'marriage', 'instead', 'playing', 'black', 'widow', 'angle', 'screenwriters', 'Betty', 'Comden', 'Adolph', 'Green', 'most', 'famous', 'songwriters', 'also', 'scripts', 'classic', 'MGM', 'musicals', 'Singin', 'Rain', 'manage', 'inordinate', 'bumptious', 'mix', 'black', 'comedy', 'slapstick', 'having', 'Louisa', 'tell', 'story', 'flashback', 'psychiatrist', 'who', 'inevitably', 'love', 'her.The', 'mastodon-sized', 'movie', 'really', 'just', 'one-joke', 'premise', 'translated', 'four', 'different', 'episodes', 'lead', 'same', 'tragicomic', 'end', 'Dick', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'Thoreau-loving', 'idler', 'Edgar', 'Hopper', 'who', 'unbearable', 'workaholic', 'turning', 'failing', 'little', 'store', 'Wal-Mart-level', 'conglomerate', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'brooding', 'impoverished', 'expatriate', 'artist', 'Larry', 'Flint', 'who', 'wacky', 'machine', 'big', 'canvases', 'music', 'then', 'toast', 'Paris', 'modern', 'paintings', 'Robert', 'Mitchum', 'maple', 'syrup', 'tycoon', 'Rod', 'Anderson', 'already', 'multi-millionaire', 'when', 'Louisa', 'wanting', 'simple', 'life', 'down', 'farm', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'third-rate', 'entertainer', 'Pinky', 'Benson', 'who', 'nightclub', 'act', 'changes', 'megalomaniacal', 'movie', 'star', 'marriage', 'Louise', 'who', 'ironically', 'husband', 'success', 'out', 'money', 'not', 'bring', 'happiness', 'bookend', 'part', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'one', 'got', 'away', 'smug', 'hometown', 'playboy', 'beginning', 'beaten', 'man', 'end', 'tireless', 'MacLaine', 'game', 'character', 'innate', 'why-me', 'innocence', 'increasingly', 'exasperating.In', 'what', 'movie', 'most', 'clever', 'parts', 'marriage', 'mini-homage', 'particular', 'film', 'genre', 'silent', 'comedy', 'Edgar', 'sexy', 'French', 'films', 'Larry', 'elaborate', 'mega-productions', 'Rod', 'course', 'MGM', 'musicals', 'Pinky', 'Mitchum', 'Newman', 'chapters', 'are', 'most', 'entertaining', 'tweak', 'respective', 'images', 'sportingly', 'Kelly', 'segment', 'highlighted', 'terrific', 'shipboard', 'musical', 'number', 'leggy', 'MacLaine', 'showcase', 'Broadway-trained', 'dancing', 'abilities', 'nimble', 'Kelly', 'Lacking', 'finesse', 'type', 'farce', 'J.', 'Lee', 'Thompson', 'proceedings', 'subtlety', 'army', 'commando', 'not', 'surprise', 'given', 'biggest', 'success', 'was', 'Guns', 'Navarone', 'worse', 'simply', 'legendary', 'Edith', 'Head', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'field', 'day', 'designing', 'MacLaine', 'series', 'elaborate', 'costumes', 'definitely', 'curio', 'bygone', 'era']",N/A

Taylor ""GFT""","[1, 1]","To describe WHAT A WAY TO GO as an ultra-light 1960s confection would be an understatement: frothy, foolish, and seeking no more than to be mildly entertaining, it is a classic of its kind and of its era.The plot is episodic.  When multi-millionaire Louisa May Foster tries to give away her money she finds herself slapped onto a psychiatrist's couch--where she details the story of a little girl from the wrong side of the tracks who was only interested in marrying for love.  But as fate would have it, every husband she touched turned to gold, and their successes spelled finish to the marriage in no uncertain terms, with each widowhood leaving Louisa even more fabulously wealthy than before.  What's a poor little rich girl to do?The charm here is in the cast and the production values.  Although she offered considerably more in her most celebrated films, Shirley MacLaine had a remarkable way with light comedy, and she pulls out all the stops as the eternal widow, at times sassy, at times silly, but never less than completely watchable.  Her unlikely co-stars--Dean Martin, Dick Van Dyke, Paul Newman, Robert Mitchum, Gene Kelly, Robert Cummings and (in her final film) the amazing Margaret Dumont--are also up to the task.The humor is both obvious and sly, lampooning various rags-to-riches (or in one case riches-to-riches) stereotypes with a wink, a nod, and now and then an unexpectedly sophisticated bit of wit.  The film works best when it gently mocks both itself and the more obvious cinematic conventions of its day, as when Louisa recalls each of her marriages with the words ""it was like one of those movies where...""  Everything from silent film to musicals gets a poke, and over-budgeted romantic blockbusters suddenly become considerably more comic than you'd ever imagine.The production values are first rate, and to say there is always something to look at on the screen would be an understatement: they are deliberately and often deliciously over the top--and often as amusing as the performances.  (The ""Lush Budget"" sequence, in which MacLaine changes gowns every few seconds, is particularly witty.)  True, the movie is a no-brainer, but it is a fun one.  Only a sour-puss could resist!

Her speaking voice is shrill, and I think the raves were mainly for her body.  So it is worth noting that I LOVE ""What a Way to Go.""  When an actress has a big name and longevity, there is ONE movie that you can point to and say, ""Watch this movie, and you will know why she is a star.""  I feel this movie is that movie for Miss MacLaine.She sings, she dances - move for move with Gene Kelly - and she carries this movie entirely on her frequently bare back.  She throws herself 100% into every ridiculous costume change and situation, always self possessed, but not self concious.  Here, her body is certainly made use of, the take-off on french art films is equally silly, sexy, and laughable ... but her over the top performance and humor lifts it all above the air-headed plot.The film itself gets kudos from me because, like Miss MacLaine, it knows exactly what it is, is comfortable with that, and can laugh at itself.  When she says, ""it's like one of those big budget movies, all about love and what will she wear next"" we know that there are no pretentions here.  That is what THIS movie is.  It is the quinessential movie celebrating being a GIRL.  It also happens to pinpoint a rare moment in movie history between the tough women, and when the boys took over.

Shirley does her best to sex him up, but it doesn't take for very long, soon as sugar he's out the door with just a kiss on her forehead.  He's down at the office dictating to his fourteen secretaries, leaving them all limp and too exhausted to type.  His name is Edgar Hopper, and that describes his character well.  For Edgar Hopper, no success is ever enough, and no gratification means anything so long as there are more profits to be made from the bargain shopper.J Lee Thompson, who made the marvelous ICE COLD IN ALEX and WOMAN IN A DRESSING GOWN in England in the 1950s, got stuck with this overstuffed black comedy.  His direction of Robert Mitchum was grand in CAPE FEAR--here, he twirls Mitchum around like a puppet doll, giving him some sexy scenes with Shirley, but then again, Mitchum and MacLaine were having an affair behind their spouses' backs, it wasn't hard to make them look like they had chemistry.  I wound up feeling that Robert Cummings, who plays Shirley's psychiatrist, Dr Stefanson, was a terribly underrated actor.  Didn't he play the same part in his next movie, the Warren Beatty Leslie Caron dud PROMISE HER ANYTHING?Gene Kelly is in love with himself in this movie, just like in real life.

Topping the list is Shirley MacLaine in a comic performance not to be missed. She brings a fresh kooky charm to her Louisa as she careens from one marriage to the next totaling a roster of husbands with Mega-Star power that today would have sunk 20th Century Fox on salary alone.Here it's all about timing, reaction and pace. All of witch Miss MacLaine is an expert. It is a sheer joy just to watch her take a thin story and make magic out of it. Dick Van Dyke, Paul Newman, Robert Mitchum, Gene Kelly, and Dean Martin aid her in her romp across the cinemascope screen.There are two standouts in the husband department for me, first, Paul Newman as an ex-patriot American artist in Paris. Rarely do we get to see him execute a comic turn and here as Larry Flint he is both sexy and funny. And Robert Mitchum as Rod Anderson, the maple syrup king is a delight.The cleverest aspect of the story is the use of Louise's remembrances of each marriage as a different genre of film from the silent screen to the big splashy musicals of the 1950's. The funniest occurs when she is married to Mitchum. It is a Lush Budget production all the way. Also of note is the big dance number with Gene Kelly, in and of itself a lampoon of Mr. Kelly's famous routines over at M.G.M. a decade before.Also of note is the superb color and cinematography of Leon Shamroy fresh off his Oscar win with ""Cleopatra"" the year before. (Note the in-joke jabs at Cleopatra and Richard Burton in two segments.) And glittering right up there with her best work are the stunning costumes of Edith Head.This DVD also includes slight extras the best of which is a newsreel of the day called ""What A Way To Go To The Fair."" It chronicles the films opening at the 1964 New York World's Fair. It is a gem all it's own.What a way to go is a light delight and a prime example of a bygone age of glamour and excess.

Comedy is definitely NOT one of them, but then Shirley Maclaine is one of the unfunniest actressesthat ever lived. Her comedic attempts being limited to whiny imitations of Lucy Riccardo.  And apparently the producers were unsuccessful in getting herto clip her 1"" long pink-lacquered supernails in the opening scenes as a pre-adolescent girl!  Perhaps that is a satire element that simply goesover my head?  It's hard to say when this movie is being funny or lame so my judgment on the supernails may be unreliable.But Maclaine makes a splendid mannequin for Edith Head's fabulous technicolor gowns and furs.That is the first reason you might want to watch this 60s glam fest.  The second reason, which is more interesting to me, is the set designs, cars,airplanes and props.  This was the age of Erico phones and stream-lined vinyl clad couches and nauseating color combinations thatsomehow worked.  If you love Mad Men you'll love the cars, clothes, jewels and furniture in this historically valuable fashion flick.Aside from the gargantuan budget for all the cosmetic elements there really isn't much of a movie to watch.  It starts off with a wonderfully hilarious scene withMargaret Dumont as Louisa May's (Maclaine's) mama.  The only belly laugh evoked in this flaccid satire is when Dumont barks out the line ""I HATE HER GUTS!""in reference to another woman in town who is rich and had snubbed Dumont at church that morning.The male leads are all good, especially Paul Newman (the third and most potent reason to see this thing) whose mouthwatering abs make you long for more!And there is a fairly risqu&eacute; shower scene showing a sideview of Newman's naked body up to his butt. (We boys weren't allowed to see this movie in the theater when it was released).Newman was truly one of the most beautiful male stars ever to grace thesilver screen and he was funny in the part of the nutty artist, though over-played like every other part in this movie.  Subtle is not a wordthat can be applied to mid-60s technicolor extravaganzas like this.It's also great to see Gene Kelly looking handsome as ever and dancing like a god.I hadn't seen What a Way to Go since it was on tv back in the broadcast days when the networks showed fairly recent movies in prime time.It was funny to a young boy then but it ain't anymore to this jaded, beaten-up middle-ager.Final verdict:  Great costumes and Erico phones and Newman's abs are not great reasons for wasting 2 hours of one's life.But if you a Mad Man addict, go for it!

She's such a great actress you are able to sympathize and laugh with her character Louisa Foster.  The plot begins with Louisa wanting to donate a cool $11 million dollar check to the IRS.  The person refuses to take the check thinking it's some twisted joke (cause in our world who would do a thing like that).  He refers her to seeing a therapist, this begins her narrataring the tales of all her short marriages, which in each one ends in death.  Before the deaths she actually finds a good deal of interest in each man, that's until when they all stumble upon riches that leads to their demise.  With each man's death she inherits a great deal of money, but the money does not make Louisa happy.  I won't spoil any farther into who Louisa chooses by the end of the film.  I found the movie to be very good.  The ending was cutesy but didnt take too much away from the whole movie.  Plus I almost forgot Ms. MacLanie's body was too incredible throughout the picture (I want one!) and the wardobes she wore in each sequence was to die for!

861654,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,B00066FB8Y,Simon Davis,"[6, 7]","The brash, colourful, and totally extrovert comedy ""What a Way to Go"", starring the endlessly energetic Shirley Maclaine really is one of the last of the great studio comedies where meticulous attention was expended on every detail of the production. Despite having made better known films that were also more successful, rarely did Shirley MacLaine a born actess and dancer have a more perfectly tailored role than in this wacky fun filled comedy. Planned originally as a vehicle for the ailing Marilyn Monroe for 1962 after she completed the ill fated and sadly never completed ""Somethings Got To Give"", this project was never realised due to Monroe's sudden death. After receiving an expression of slight interest from Elizabeth Taylor the role then fell in to the lap of the woman who was absolutely best suited for the role and the results on screen prove it. With her battery of amazing leading men such as Paul Newman, Robert Mitchum, Dean Martin, Gene Kelly and Dick Van Dyke, Shirley MacLaine makes the end result a totally delightful frothy comedy that gets its memorable quality very much from the talents involved and from the wonderful care expended on every facet of the production by Twentieth Century Fox which in 1964 was still reeling from the financial woes caused by ""Cleopatra""and badly needed a hit to pull it out of the financial doldrums.Based on an amusing story by Gwen Davis, Shirley MacLaine plays the ""eternal jinx"", Louisa May Foster who as the story opens attempts to hand over a multi million dollar check as a donation to the American Government. The reason for this very strange action soon becomes all too clear as we learn the strange story of Louisa's journey through marriage to four husbands in her eternal search for the man who will just be happy with nothing and not want to become a big success. During her sessions with a psychiatrist Dr. Stephanson (Robert Cummings), Louisa relates each of her illfated marriages in turn from their supposedly simple happy beginnings to their tragic ends where each man becomes consumed by money and success which ends up costing him his life. We meet each of the husbands in turn; firstly simple Edgar Hopper (Dick Van Dyke) a man previously happy with his run down garage but who after being goaded by Louisa's wealthy beau Leonard Crawley (Dean Martin) as a failure, becomes the founder of Hopper's department stores that become a world wide success but which give Edgar a fatal heart attack. We then see Louisa travel to Paris where she meets and fall in love with ex patriot artist Larry Flint (Paul Newman) a wildly eccentric artist who doesn't paint to sell his works but who after marriage to Louisa discovers the magic of the painting machine which can turn out ""masterpices"", made to order. However success has its price when these very same painting machines that made him wealthy end up killing him in a tragic malfunction. On the way back to the States Louisa then becomes involved with the wealthy maple Syrup King Rod Anderson Jr.(Robert Mitcham), who in a cruel twist of fate while trying to adapt to the quiet simple life that Louisa craves is killed by a kicking bull on their quiet little farming spread. Husband No. 4 appears in th eform of second rate cabaret performer Pinky Benson who performs in a seedy night club in a clown act. At Louisa's suggestion one night he performs without makeup and suddenly his star quality is discovered which whisks him away to fame and fortune and a mansion done entirely in pink even down to the water in the pool! However fame has its drawbacks and just as Louisa realises she has jinxed her man again Pinky is trampled to death by his over zealous fans leaving her a widow for the fourth time. Just as she believes life has no meaning Louisa runs into Leonard Crawly now a simple janitor in her psychiatrist's office and love blooms yet again and despite a close call with ""sudden wealth"" again when an oil gusher on the farm turns out to be a ruptured pipe it looks like Louisa has finally found the simple life she has always craved.I totally enjoyed this crazy comedy and found much to appreciate in each of the four husband's separate stories. Despite having very different screen personas I felt all the actors playing the husbands contributed something quite worthwhile in their stories and each had a believable (although short lived!) chemistry with Shirley MacLaine. Paul Newman I thought was an absolute standout in his very non traditional role of avante garde artist Larry Flint and it was a joy to see him in such a wildly uninhibited performance which is a side rarely seen in his work. Despite some people disliking his work in the film I thought Gene Kelly also did well as the sad clown performer Pinky Benson who finds stardom and ""goes Holywood"" right down to a pink mansion with pink water in the swimming pool. Dick Van Dyke who around this time enjoyed his greatest screen success in ""Mary Poppins"", was also another favourite of mine among the illfated husbands and brings his usual jovial charm to the role of husband No. 1 Edgar Hooper and his money making advertising slogan of ""hop hop down to hop hop hoppers"", is a jingle which I always find hard to get out of my mind after viewing this movie! Shirley MacLaine manages her character well through the demise of all her success driven husbands and the film does provide a dazzling showcase for her talents multi talents in comedy and dance when in clever flash back scenes she recalls each of her marriages in terms of a different film genre, for example a very funny silent film spoof for the Dick Van Dyke marriage, to an elaborate musical production number fittingly for the Gene Kelly sequence. All of this is packaged with truly opulent production values so typical of the at the time fast dying Old Hollywood studio system. Blessed with gorgeous colour photography and incredibly lavish sets and costumes for Shirley MacLaine the film was deservedly nominated for two Academy Awards  for Edith Head for costume design and for Art/Set Direction but in the light of the ""My Fair Lady"", juggernaut that same year at the awards this film didn't win either unfortunately.For a last glimpse at the Old style Hollywood form of movie making when star power spoke more than words on the screen ""What a Way to Go!"", makes delightful entertainment of the first order. Certainly the story is light and frothy and doesn't warrant any indepth examination however it is the stars first and foremost that make it memorable viewing. The casting of Shirley MacLaine as the much married Louisa was a totally suitable choice and it is due to her energy and gutsy playing alongside her various ""husbands"", that makes this such an enjoyable farce. For a slice of Hollywood glamour of the old school try and check out Twentieth Century Fox's lavish comedy ""What a Way to Go!"", soon.",4,"Dazzling  1960's Comedy Providing A Wonderful Showcase For

She meets men, influential sometimes, sometimes not, but somehow she makes them into accomplished men in their own rights, she marries them but somehow mostly through their own greed and ambition, they end up dying.In Robert Mitchum's case, he had just given up his wealthy lifestyle, but while he was milking the cow, he went to a steer instead of the lady cow and lost his life. Yet in spite of it, she moves on to someone else that does well for themselves but at the end, I believe she ended up happy and this time with kids and with the first man she started dating.

861660,A1Y8FBJLVK6LS9,B00066FB8Y,Wayne A.,"[3, 8]","Depending on the angle you view it from, this film deserves anywhere from 1 to 10 stars. It's MacLaine and Maclaine alone who rescues this bizarre-yet-entertaining hodge-podge from embarrassment. In reality, she rescued the film itself from oblivion, since it was originally created as a Monroe vehicle and was supposed to be plenty darker. One can imagine, given the basics of the plot, just how dark it could have become. In its original form, with Marilyn Monroe starring, this could have been one of her best films.No worry, this flick is an entirely different story. Briefly: nice, sincere, simple gal--against wishes of mom, marries series of simple-life guys who strike it rich and die--with a variation or two on that theme. The plot lacks a Pilgrim's Progress quality which makes the MacLaine character seem more like she's caught in a crazy pointless time loop than advancing spiritually (a possible reading of the movie!). Weirdly, she doesn't need to advance spiritually; she knows exactly what she wants and what she wants is good. This makes her character extremely appealing and the rest of the movie awkward and lumpy. The good bits, and there are many, clearly belong to Compden and Green who were brought in to kick this up a bit. Good choice.It doesn't help me personally that 3--count 'em--3 of my least favorite male actors from that era play various husbands. Dean Martin is always unpleasant to watch; a minute of him and I've got hair grease and slime all over everything in my living room. Dick Van Dyke was one of the un-funniest comedians of all time (he should have been shot for his work on Mary Poppins), a complete ham, yet he puts in a forgivable, even fine, performance in this flick as a Thoreau-reading unambitious shop-owner who overnight turns into workaholic Mr. Wal Mart. Actually, this might be the funniest I've ever seen him be. That segment should be shown in every business school in the nation.Worst of all is Gene Kelly, another ham, possibly King of Hams (who should have been shot for his inability to act in Inherit the Wind--nearly single-handedly wrecking an otherwise terrific movie), who seems barely aware that anyone is on camera with him (there is absolutely no electricity between him and Maclaine) and then transforms into a superstar egomaniac in the story. What might have been ironic with another actor is just annoying with this chump. Kelly existed solely to prove to the world what an amazing and classy actor/dancer/comedian/entertainer Fred Astaire was and Astaire would have been far more believable in this part. Astaire lampoons himself in ""Bandwagon"" and it's charming and endearing.Paul Newman also hams it up way too much as an wacko artist one reviewer thinks is based on Jackson Pollock. Wrongo. A sign of the weird hip-ness of this movie is he's based on junk artist Jean Tinguley and as if to prove this, a character resembling Tinguley's girlfriend--artist Nicki de St.Phalle--is seen creating a painting by shooting at balloons filled with paint-- just as de St. Phalle once did. Newman's only tolerable--his is a bad parody of a modern artist and it's also hopelessly out-of-date for 1964. Robert Mitchum fills in for the too-expensive Sinatra and it shows. Ive never gotten the impression that Mitchum even tried to act. It's disturbing--all these men (characters and actors) in the MacLaine character's life and she outshines every one in every respect.That, then, gets to the point. this is her film and it was designed to showcase all her talent and charm. She does everything from song and dance, to high and low comedy. At one point she walks into a swimming pool scene wearing an outrageous backless bikini and looks breathtaking--demonstrating for all time that sex appeal does not have to rely on vamping or pneumatics (an ironic point given who she replaced). The script uses every opportunity to get her out of her clothes and she doesn't seem to mind. Feminists could have an international conference on this film and post-modern readings should abound. Her character is strong and willful, self-confident and sexually healthy, but she keeps meeting these ""great guys"" (played by jerks) who, over and over, shove her in the kitchen or treat her as a trophy wife (Maybe it's not just coincidence that so many vile male actors are in this?). They all die, as they should, except one, and the jury could be out for months on what that's all about. As lumpy and itchy as this film is, it's absolutely fascinating. Visually, it's a stunner with terrific sets and props. It's worth the price just to see the mansion where everything, inside and out, is painted pink.With all that said, I heartily recommend it but be ready for a strange experience. I expect over time this movie might clarify as a vaguely subversive film (Compden and Greene had that bomb-throwing anarchist streak in them) and I look forward to repeat viewings. Shirley Maclaine is just spectacular from beginning to end and for that alone this film is worth the price.",5,5 stars is just an average,1124841600,"08 24, 2005",2005,5022,"['Depending', 'angle',
