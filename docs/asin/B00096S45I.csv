902214,A20RQB3SXOQCGF,B00096S45I,Birdman,"[6, 9]","Michael Tucker's camera takes the viewer into a combat zone, exposing the paradoxical horror and boredom of war through the words and faces of combatants.More than one reviewer notes that Tucker doesn't create a ""focused"" documentary, that the film doesn't evolve as a work of fiction might. They  imply that it might not capture and hold the attention of all viewers.While I agree with this, I can't dismiss the way GUNNER PALACE honors the combatants of a war that has escaped the honest scrutiny of average Americans.Except for understandable swings at our Secretary of Defense, the film maintains gravitas.  It offers searing images of the Iraqi people, the most jarring of which is that of a young girl rushing down the staircase of a safe house in her nightgown at gunpoint. I did not find it easy or convenient to dismiss such imagery, but couldn't turn it off either.It is no accident Tucker focuses on the kindness, patience and compassion of many soldiers, reminding his audience that real people live beneath the body armor -- if they were fortune at have received it at all.Tucker's combat rap segments are edgy and the lyrics potent and honest.Music plays its role here as it always has in war movies, but it is less rebellious and more angry.The film might have been more effective if the director had followed the lives of a just a few characters over time.  I wanted to know who these men were as the film progressed, but ended up knowing much less than I'd hoped.All this aside, GUNNER PALACE is worth your attention.  My package also indicated that a portion of proceeds will benefit families of soldiers in need, so I was more than happy to buy a copy.These are hard times, and much in America seems overly politicized and chaotic now. But few citizens will mourn the secrets and waste of this war more than those who risked everything to fight it.",4,A Good Film  that Might Have Been Great,1120521600,"07 5, 2005",2005,1867,"['Michael', 'Tucker', 'camera', 'viewer', 'combat', 'zone', 'exposing', 'paradoxical', 'horror', 'boredom', 'war', 'words', 'combatants.More', 'one', 'reviewer', 'Tucker', ""n't"", 'create', 'focused', 'documentary', 'film', ""n't"", 'evolve', 'work', 'fiction', 'might', 'imply', 'might', 'not', 'capture', 'hold', 'attention', 'viewers.While', 'agree', 'ca', ""n't"", 'dismiss', 'way', 'GUNNER', 'PALACE', 'combatants', 'war', 'escaped', 'honest', 'scrutiny', 'average', 'Americans.Except', 'understandable', 'swings', 'Secretary', 'Defense', 'film', 'gravitas', 'searing', 'images', 'Iraqi', 'people', 'most', 'jarring', 'young', 'girl', 'rushing', 'down', 'staircase', 'safe', 'house', 'nightgown', 'gunpoint', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'easy', 'convenient', 'dismiss', 'such', 'imagery', 'could', ""n't"", 'turn', 'off', 'either.It', 'accident', 'Tucker', 'kindness', 'patience', 'compassion', 'many', 'soldiers', 'reminding', 'audience', 'real', 'people', 'live', 'body', 'armor', 'were', 'fortune', 'have', 'received', 'all.Tucker', 'combat', 'rap', 'segments', 'are', 'edgy', 'lyrics', 'potent', 'honest.Music', 'role', 'here', 'always', 'war', 'movies', 'less', 'rebellious', 'more', 'angry.The', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'effective', 'director', 'had', 'followed', 'lives', 'just', 'few', 'characters', 'time', 'wanted', 'know', 'who', 'men', 'were', 'film', 'progressed', 'ended', 'up', 'knowing', 'much', 'less', ""'d"", 'hoped.All', 'aside', 'GUNNER', 'PALACE', 'attention', 'package', 'also', 'indicated', 'portion', 'proceeds', 'will', 'benefit', 'families', 'soldiers', 'need', 'was', 'more', 'happy', 'buy', 'copy.These', 'are', 'hard', 'times', 'much', 'America', 'overly', 'politicized', 'chaotic', 'now', 'few', 'citizens', 'will', 'mourn', 'secrets', 'waste', 'war', 'more', 'who', 'risked', 'everything', 'fight']",Gunner Palace
902215,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B00096S45I,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[1, 5]","GUNNER PALACE is a good look at soldiering in Iraq. But it's not a great documentary.Since I'm an optomist, though, I'll start with the positives of the film ...GUNNER PALACE is a startling look inside the Iraq war. But it's not told from the documentary maker's standpoint; it's told from the men and women who are there, everyday, fighting to just stay alive and, sometimes, fighting off boredom.Music permeates the film as Vietnam era songs (FLIGHT OF THE VALKYRIE, etc.) mix with rap songs performed and created by the soldiers themselves. It's as if there's a connection being made between that lost war of the 60s and 70s and that which our young fighters are going through in the deserts and city streets of Iraq. I found this intriguing and pretty insightful into the minds of our Armed Forces.Contrary to some other reviewers here, I found that the documentary maker (Mike Tucker) DID ask pertinent questions (""Do you feel you're doing a good job?"" ""What do you think the people back home think about what you're doing over here?"" etc.) These are excellent questions to ask and allows the viewer a peek into the soldiers' minds.I could also feel some of the tension the men and women go through as they describe cringing at a piece of trash alongside the road, wondering if its an IED (Improvised Explosive Device) waiting to destroy their vehicle as they pass.Where the documentary fell apart a bit was the overall flow of the story. There isn't one. The herky-jerky movement from place to place and person to person allowed for minimal immersion into various aspects of the war and these soldiers' experiences. Although some of this information came across, it should've been in a much smoother fashion.Let me end this review by saying that I respect what our Armed Forces are doing in Iraq. Although I don't agree with our current U.S. government administration and how this war came to be, I'm humbled by how dedicated our young men and women soldiers are ""over there.""",3,An Insightful Look At Soldiers In Conflict,1132358400,"11 19, 2005",2005,1982,"['GUNNER', 'PALACE', 'good', 'look', 'soldiering', 'Iraq', 'not', 'great', 'documentary.Since', ""'m"", 'optomist', ""'ll"", 'start', 'positives', 'film', 'GUNNER', 'PALACE', 'startling', 'look', 'Iraq', 'war', 'not', 'told', 'documentary', 'maker', 'standpoint', 'told', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'there', 'everyday', 'fighting', 'just', 'stay', 'alive', 'sometimes', 'fighting', 'off', 'boredom.Music', 'film', 'Vietnam', 'era', 'songs', 'FLIGHT', 'THE', 'VALKYRIE', 'etc', 'mix', 'rap', 'songs', 'performed', 'created', 'soldiers', 'connection', 'being', 'made', 'lost', 'war', '60s', '70s', 'young', 'fighters', 'are', 'going', 'deserts', 'city', 'streets', 'Iraq', 'found', 'intriguing', 'pretty', 'insightful', 'minds', 'Armed', 'Forces.Contrary', 'other', 'reviewers', 'here', 'found', 'documentary', 'maker', 'Mike', 'Tucker', 'DID', 'ask', 'pertinent', 'questions', 'Do', 'feel', ""'re"", 'doing', 'good', 'job', 'What', 'do', 'think', 'people', 'back', 'home', 'think', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'here', 'etc', 'are', 'excellent', 'questions', 'ask', 'viewer', 'peek', 'soldiers', 'minds.I', 'could', 'also', 'feel', 'tension', 'men', 'women', 'go', 'describe', 'cringing', 'piece', 'trash', 'road', 'wondering', 'IED', 'Improvised', 'Explosive', 'Device', 'waiting', 'destroy', 'vehicle', 'pass.Where', 'documentary', 'fell', 'apart', 'bit', 'was', 'overall', 'flow', 'story', ""n't"", 'one', 'herky-jerky', 'movement', 'place', 'place', 'person', 'person', 'allowed', 'minimal', 'immersion', 'various', 'aspects', 'war', 'soldiers', 'experiences', 'information', 'came', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'much', 'smoother', 'fashion.Let', 'end', 'review', 'saying', 'respect', 'what', 'Armed', 'Forces', 'are', 'doing', 'Iraq', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'current', 'U.S.', 'government', 'administration', 'how', 'war', 'came', 'be', ""'m"", 'humbled', 'how', 'dedicated', 'young', 'men', 'women', 'soldiers', 'are', 'there']",Gunner Palace

902218,A3BEF4IHWI0VC,B00096S45I,Chris Luallen,"[2, 2]","""Gunner Palace"" is a documentary by Michael Tucker which attempts to show the reality of life in Iraq from the perspective of the soldiers of the 2/3 Field Artillery unit. They live in the bombed out palace of Saddam's spoiled son, Uday, and experience fear and laughter, exhiliration and boredom, as they go about their daily lives as troops.I think it's interesting that there have been many both  positive and negative reviews of the film by soldiers currently stationed in Iraq. I say this because I believe the soldiers portrayed in this movie, with a few exceptions, come across as very confused and immature young men who really have no sense of purpose about being in Iraq and are mostly just anxious to return home as soon as possible. Most of the soldiers are very honest about the fact that they are there only out of financial necessity or a misguided search for adventure. Even the ones who joined the military out of patriotism seem thoroughly disillusioned about the war itself and the fact that most Iraqs see them as invaders rather than defenders. I have no idea what Tucker's motives were for making this film. But it is definitely more effective as an anti-war movie than the clearly biased ""Farenheit 9/11"" ever was.Even more disturbed by the soldier's behavior was my wife, who grew up in the country of Ecuador. She is not really a politically-minded person. But I think what provoked her strong reaction was the mistreatment of certain Iraqs by some of the soldiers. Iraq is a totally different culture than Ecuador and is also a United States ally. But she didn't like seeing the bullying of other brown-skinned people, ""abuse of power"" is what she kept yelling at the screen. This is perhaps also due to the long history of U.S. military intervention in Latin America and our support for numerous corrupt and murderous dictators there such as Augusto Pinochet in Chile and the Somoza family in Nicaragua.Overall, I think this movie does a decent job of conveying what is really going on in Iraq. But I might not be too happy about its portrayal of the soldiers if I was in the military myself.",4,The Life of United States Soldiers In Iraq,1132963200,"11 26, 2005",2005,2119,"['Gunner', 'Palace', 'documentary', 'Michael', 'Tucker', 'show', 'reality', 'life', 'Iraq', 'perspective', 'soldiers', '2/3', 'Field', 'Artillery', 'unit', 'live', 'bombed', 'palace', 'Saddam', 'spoiled', 'son', 'Uday', 'experience', 'fear', 'laughter', 'exhiliration', 'boredom', 'go', 'daily', 'lives', 'troops.I', 'think', 'interesting', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'positive', 'negative', 'reviews', 'film', 'soldiers', 'currently', 'stationed', 'Iraq', 'say', 'believe', 'soldiers', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'few', 'exceptions', 'come', 'very', 'confused', 'immature', 'young', 'men', 'who', 'really', 'have', 'sense', 'purpose', 'being', 'Iraq', 'are', 'mostly', 'just', 'anxious', 'return', 'home', 'as', 'soon', 'possible', 'Most', 'soldiers', 'are', 'very', 'honest', 'fact', 'are', 'there', 'only', 'financial', 'necessity', 'misguided', 'search', 'adventure', 'Even', 'ones', 'who', 'joined', 'military', 'out', 'patriotism', 'seem', 'thoroughly', 'disillusioned', 'war', 'fact', 'most', 'Iraqs', 'see', 'invaders', 'rather', 'defenders', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'Tucker', 'motives', 'were', 'making', 'film', 'definitely', 'more', 'effective', 'anti-war', 'movie', 'clearly', 'biased', 'Farenheit', '9/11', 'ever', 'was.Even', 'more', 'disturbed', 'soldier', 'behavior', 'was', 'wife', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'country', 'Ecuador', 'not', 'really', 'politically-minded', 'person', 'think', 'what', 'provoked', 'strong', 'reaction', 'was', 'mistreatment', 'certain', 'Iraqs', 'soldiers', 'Iraq', 'totally', 'different', 'culture', 'Ecuador', 'also', 'United', 'States', 'ally', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'seeing', 'bullying', 'other', 'brown-skinned', 'people', 'abuse', 'power', 'what', 'kept', 'yelling', 'screen', 'perhaps', 'also', 'due', 'long', 'history', 'U.S.', 'military', 'intervention', 'Latin', 'America', 'support', 'numerous', 'corrupt', 'murderous', 'dictators', 'there', 'such', 'Augusto', 'Pinochet', 'Chile', 'Somoza', 'family', 'Nicaragua.Overall', 'think', 'movie', 'decent', 'job', 'conveying', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'Iraq', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'too', 'happy', 'portrayal', 'soldiers', 'was', 'military', 'myself']",Gunner Palace
902219,A2BEU7GPGNIG44,B00096S45I,Dorrie Wheeler,"[24, 34]","Gunner Palace is a documentary film that was directed by Michael Tucker and Petra Epperlein. The film will be released on DVD on June 28th.The documentary film let's American viewers take a inside look at what goes on in Iraq with the U.S. troops. The stuff that isn't show on the news. The documentary isn't as polished or quite as Hollywood as some documentaries but it has a powerful message. By polished, I mean there wasn't always a lot of direction. At times it seemed like just a collection of footage. The clips are show and often little captions are shown on the bottom of the screen. The amazing thing about the film is how young the young men are serving over there. A 19 year old combat veteran discusses how he will be honored when he comes home because he is a war veteran. A young man is shown holding a baby. A female G.I. discusses the interesting glances that she receives from both men and women in Iraq who might not be used to seeing a woman in uniform. Troops are shown receiving orders and following through. The film also touches on a challenge they face not discussed. Interpreters and traitors. One man they show was an alley to the U.S. troops and he is shown in custody for suspicion of giving information to insurgents. One soldier also discusses the poor quality of armor on their vehicles. Another young soldier discusses the trauma and sleeplessness he experienced after the first time he had to kill someone.When you watch a movie like this or Fahrenheit 9-11, you know someone is going to die. It is the reality that adds to the drama of the film. In this film a young man named Ben Colgan is killed by a roadside explosion. We hear of his death in a voice over by the narrator. It's tragic and the narrator also discusses other G.I.'s that were killed who had posed on a popular news magazine.An interesting aspect of the film is how important music is to the young soldiers. One young man delivers raps related to his experience. Another young man is shown playing a guitar.Overall, Gunner Palace is a good documentary about the day to day life of our soldiers serving in Iraq. It is amazing just how close the film makers got to the troops and their operations. They even captured a raid on a house where a tank (or truck) crashed into a house and the troops rushed inside.",4,"Gunner Palace is Good, Sending Messages via Music",1118880000,"06 16, 2005",2005,2310,"['Gunner', 'Palace', 'documentary', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'Michael', 'Tucker', 'Petra', 'Epperlein', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'June', '28th.The', 'documentary', 'film', 'let', 'American', 'viewers', 'take', 'inside', 'look', 'what', 'Iraq', 'U.S.', 'troops', 'stuff', ""n't"", 'show', 'news', 'documentary', ""n't"", 'as', 'polished', 'quite', 'as', 'Hollywood', 'documentaries', 'powerful', 'message', 'polished', 'mean', 'was', ""n't"", 'always', 'lot', 'direction', 'times', 'seemed', 'like', 'just', 'collection', 'footage', 'clips', 'are', 'show', 'often', 'little', 'captions', 'are', 'shown', 'bottom', 'screen', 'amazing', 'thing', 'film', 'how', 'young', 'young', 'men', 'are', 'serving', 'there', '19', 'year', 'old', 'combat', 'veteran', 'how', 'will', 'be', 'honored', 'when', 'home', 'war', 'veteran', 'young', 'man', 'shown', 'holding', 'baby', 'female', 'G.I', 'interesting', 'glances', 'men', 'women', 'Iraq', 'who', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'used', 'seeing', 'woman', 'uniform', 'Troops', 'are', 'shown', 'receiving', 'orders', 'following', 'film', 'also', 'challenge', 'face', 'not', 'discussed', 'Interpreters', 'traitors', 'One', 'man', 'show', 'was', 'alley', 'U.S.', 'troops', 'shown', 'custody', 'suspicion', 'giving', 'information', 'insurgents', 'One', 'soldier', 'also', 'poor', 'quality', 'armor', 'vehicles', 'young', 'soldier', 'trauma', 'sleeplessness', 'experienced', 'first', 'time', 'had', 'kill', 'someone.When', 'watch', 'movie', 'Fahrenheit', '9-11', 'know', 'someone', 'going', 'die', 'reality', 'drama', 'film', 'film', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Ben', 'Colgan', 'killed', 'roadside', 'explosion', 'hear', 'death', 'voice', 'narrator', 'tragic', 'narrator', 'also', 'other', 'G.I', 'were', 'killed', 'who', 'had', 'posed', 'popular', 'news', 'magazine.An', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'film', 'how', 'important', 'music', 'young', 'soldiers', 'One', 'young', 'man', 'delivers', 'raps', 'related', 'experience', 'young', 'man', 'shown', 'playing', 'guitar.Overall', 'Gunner', 'Palace', 'good', 'documentary', 'day', 'day', 'life', 'soldiers', 'serving', 'Iraq', 'amazing', 'just', 'how', 'close', 'film', 'makers', 'got', 'troops', 'operations', 'even', 'captured', 'raid', 'house', 'where', 'tank', 'truck', 'crashed', 'house', 'troops', 'rushed', 'inside']",Gunner Palace

902221,A1OCOT9XQ1FBSW,B00096S45I,El Jimmy,"[9, 12]","Before I get into the review, I just gotta point out that the music in the film has become an issue by other reviewers, that the RAP MUSIC is not appropriate for the film. Did it not occur to the reviewers who had issue to this that the RAP MUSIC is original stuff from soldiers featured in the documentary? (You can see some of them perform it for you on camera. It isn't P-Diddy or Snoop Dogg or Dr. Dre...Its our own US Troops!) I'd say its appropriate enough, wouldn't you? Yes, they curse and use the N word, but i'd say they have the right to say whatever they want, wouldn't you? Or is it that those people don't like RAP MUSIC for whatever reason? (The guitar music heard in the film was also played by one of the troops, SPC Wilf to be exact.)Anyways, I agree with other reviewers that it could've been better, the film didn't really flow and was somewhat disorganized, that being the fault of the director.  But otherwise, we get to see what this particular unit goes through for a couple of months, which is something you don't see on CNN. You get insight on what the soldiers are feeling and going through.  They show the interaction with some of the pro-US Iraqis helping catch insurgents. It then resembles a COPS episode when they investigate possible insurgent houses and weapons caches. And I'm glad there was minimal combat seen on the film, as some reviewers were disappointed with. I know its going on over there on a daily basis, but i don't enjoy seeing footage of our troops getting killed.I especially liked the part when they pointed out the customized armor on one of their Humvees, showing that the soldier that brought up that point to Rumsfeld a while back really wasn't BS like some White House reps have pointed out.  This is not a political film, pro-war or anti-war, although some of the soldiers interviewed don't believe in the war.  Overall, a very good documentary.

902222,A2MZXLN9TLP1R4,B00096S45I,GLBT,"[60, 83]","On the one hand, I really WANTED to like this movie... the news media has done a remarkably poor job of covering this story and of letting the American people know what's going on in Iraq, so I was really jazzed that someone actually went to Iraq and filmed what's going on.But...As a documentary, this is pretty lame stuff. In an effort to remain politically neutral (at least, I'm guessing that's the reason...) the director refrains from saying anything at all, or from letting the soldiers say anything at all, that has any real bearing on the situation they're in. There's no context, in other words. There's no discussion of why they're in Iraq, if they're succeeding in their goals or not, what they suppose those goals to be, how they feel about being there, etc. Instead, we get a lot of footage of soldiers jumping into the swimming pool, goofing around in their off-hours, and doing raps.  Lots and lots of raps.I'm guessing that the director is really interested in rapping. Either that, or the soldiers in Iraq really spend half their waking hours rapping to one another. Seems unlikely...Beyond that, the chronology of the movie is confusing. About 2/3 through the film, the director leaves Iraq, with the expected cliches about ""I had mixed feelings about leaving... for me, home was only 10 hours away. For these guys, though, the war would continue."" and so on... he goes home... we see footage of his kitchen as he makes some tea (?), footage of his daughter holding a sparkler (???), and he dramatically reads aloud an email about one of the soldiers being killed shortly after he left Iraq.So, you'd think that would be the end of the movie.But, no. Instead, it goes on from there. So, my question is, if he's gone home... who's filming the documentary???  Why is it still going on?

Just ordinary people dealing with extraordinary circumstances.I cannot believe I found a documentary of this niche: by the way, for any of you yet to realize... EVERY DOCUMENTARY EVER MADE is one-sided.  If ""Gunner Palace"" is indeed, one-sided, it has got to be the most neutral one-side presented with homespun grit and gumption.Tucker and Epperlein are wise filmmakers.  Don't hold any pretense, just capture the action and any numbing bon mot these soldiers might harbor.  They get it all.  This film will make you nervous... it is balls-to-the-wall real.  From the guitar-thrashing Corporal to the GIs commending the unreal splendor of Burger King Whoppers, ""Gunner Palace"" illustrates anxious kids amongst a world of frightened men.  Not exactly the most stable or safest place to be.They know this, and perform their nightly raids.  Targets alter between Number 89 on the Top 100 Terrorist List to random ramshackle outfits making homemade fertilizer bombs.  Every entry into a house is a will-they-or-won't-they of all returning to Gunner Palace safely.  ""GP"" tests your resolve, but above all, your nerves.Tucker, in my opinion, is a gifted cameraman, only capturing inherent action and never instigating any.  Fly on the wall, baby, fly on the wall.  It's photographed HD Digital, yet still traps you in the confines of Fallujah and Baghdad like only 35mm could.  Their enemies disappear in the street crowds, some as young as 6 years old.  And unless they keep their eyes on them, they get stoned... or worse, grenaded.  The camera itself has many close calls.No better way to recommend it than to watch it, absorb it, love it.  This is documentary filmmaking at its bravest and most dangerous.  Recommended to anyone thinking they have all the answers on Iraq.  Watch this, and a fount of questions will arise.Curious for ACTUAL DATA about Iraq, people?  Tired of Murdoch's lies, and Jennings' self-debasement?  ""Gunner Palace"" is what's really happening.

The Republican side will have you believe that the only truth comes from FOX because all other media is Liberal. The Democrats would have you believe that the #1 cause of mis-information is FOX news. And, here we are, regular America. Stuck in the middle. Sometimes we take a side and fight the other off. Sometimes we try not to take a side. Sometimes we fight about our 'side' of the argument. This movie shows some of the truth that we don't see. While not a movie showcasing extreme violence, this film removes the curtain of partisanship. You cannot deny what you see with your own eyes. No matter what the political stand you take, you will find some things you agree with, and some things that you don't in this movie. But, there is no argument about what is going on around these guys. The focus being on a small group of moderatley (musically) talented guys who try to be honest into the camera. What the streets of Baghdad really look like. Does it look like a Bustling city of commerce as Rusty Humphries (right-wing radio personality)  stated it did after he visited there. He even said he brought back souveniers. Although, he said it on the radio, so i never saw what he brought back. Or, does Baghdad look like a hovel of bombed out buildings and homeless people like Michael Moore has stated? Sure, these were essentially passing comments by both of these gentlemen. Things said more for political beliefs than anything else. And, they will probably be forgotten over time. But, aren't you the least bit curious what it IS like? What the soldiers really think? This movie showcases almost 400 soldiers. Focusing on a few of them for the sake of continuity. But, still, quite a few soldiers share their sentiment. And, they deserve our attention. Is it peaceful over there? Are we gaining ground. Please watch this film. Please buy this film. A portion of the proceeds go to help the families of the nearly 1,800 (as of 7.05) soldiers who have died in this war. We support our soldiers, right? We should.

Surreal because those of us that haven't been in the military and haven't had to live with imminent violence from all directions don't always comprehend what it must be like.  Gunner Palace gives a dramatic and respectful look into that world.The soldiers tell you about life in post-Sadaam Iraq, how they cope with dark humor and raps while being face with IEDs (improvised explosive devices), RPGs (rocket propelled grenades), mortar rounds and untold other threats day after day, week after week.  The language is raw and uncensored, possibly offensive to some, but given the context it's natural.  In fact, with most of the actual violence and blood occurring off camera, the language is the harshest part of the film.  These are young men and women living in an alien world, trying to do the job they've been assigned and make the best of it.It's not exactly recruiting film stuff, but then again this film does nothing to dishonor the soldiers either.  It portrays them as professionals that cope with a very difficult assignment.  It's an assignment that will take some of the lives of them, a reality that adds considerable poignancy to the conversations captured on film.The troops that the filmmakers worked with are/were quartered in a palace built and decorated by Sadaam's son Uday.  Supposedly this was one of the places where he hosted his wild parties, that gives a kernel of truth to the rather titillating references to it being a ""pleasure palace"" in promotional pieces and some reviews.

The final words are from the very young soldiers, basically crying that ""nothing good ever came from someone being killed"", which is just not true, unless you are completely naive and ignorant of reality and history.So it's unfortunate that this movie has been tainted by the Liberal Agenda.I prefer ""Lima Company"" , ""Restrepo"", and ""Generation Kill"".Of course, serving in a military situation is not pleasant and war is always messed up.That is the nature of war. However, the USA sacrifices innumerable soldiers just to protect possible civilian injury or ""collateral damage"". There are liberal whackjobs who sit around crying about Hiroshima, but guess what!?The freedom that they squander was paid for by the lives of soldiers fighting wars very similar to the one in Iraq.

I assume the producer had only limited time, maybe 3-4 days, to shadow the troops he was filming and during that time, essentially, nothing happened.  The titles on-screen tell us that a couple weeks later so-and-so was killed, and across town an IED exploded, but on-camera all we get is the daily routine of these fresh-faced high-school kids, 19- and 20-years old, going out on patrols in their Humvees.During the day they're holed up in Uday Hussein's old palace (not a very good image for U.S. troops), while at night they careen through Baghdad streets blasting ""The Ride of the Valkyries"" from the stereo (a la ""Apocalypse Now"" - even worse publicity).  They raid the homes of suspected ""bad guys"" (from what intelligence we're not told, but their raids mostly come up empty), banging down doors in the dead of night and shouting incoherent instructions in English to the terrified families in their beds.  Meanwhile Donald Rumsfeld drones on and on in radio broadcasts about progress being made in ""winning the war.""One wonders what war he's talking about.",4,Hours of Boredom,1199491200,"01 5, 2008",2008,1194,"['War', 'been', 'described', 'hours', 'boredom', 'punctuated', 'moments', 'sheer', 'terror', 'nothing', 'much', 'documentary', 'assume', 'producer', 'had', 'only', 'limited', 'time', 'maybe', '3-4', 'days', 'shadow', 'troops', 'was', 'filming', 'time', 'essentially', 'nothing', 'happened', 'titles', 'on-screen', 'tell', 'couple', 'weeks', 'later', 'so-and-so', 'was', 'killed', 'town', 'IED', 'exploded', 'on-camera', 'get', 'daily', 'routine', 'fresh-faced', 'high-school', 'kids', '19-', '20-years', 'old', 'going', 'out', 'patrols', 'Humvees.During', 'day', ""'re"", 'holed', 'up', 'Uday', 'Hussein', 'old', 'palace', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'image', 'U.S.', 'troops', 'night', 'careen', 'Baghdad', 'streets', 'blasting', 'Ride', 'Valkyries', 'stereo', 'la', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'even', 'worse', 'publicity', 'raid', 'homes', 'suspected', 'bad', 'guys', 'what', 'intelligence', ""'re"", 'not', 'told', 'raids', 'mostly', 'come', 'up', 'empty', 'banging', 'down', 'doors', 'dead', 'night', 'shouting', 'incoherent', 'instructions', 'English', 'terrified', 'families', 'beds', 'Meanwhile', 'Donald', 'Rumsfeld', 'drones', 'radio', 'broadcasts', 'progress', 'being', 'made', 'winning', 'war', 'One', 'war', 'talking']",Gunner Palace

Yep, that's what happens over and over; the poor go fight, kill and die for the interests of the rich.  This seems to be the understated theme of ""Gunner Palace,"" an intimate portrait of the young men and women, mostly minorities, all from the working or underclass, who are trying to make sense of a senseless war.One young soldier laments that he doesn't feel like he's protecting his country and that the country has not needed protection for quite sometime.  He follows orders, because that is what a soldier does.  But he is aware of the fact that he has been sent to war for a reason other than the only one that warrants such action, that reason being an imminent threat to the U.S.Another soldier jokes about the sub-par equipment made available to him and to his fellows.  His buddies laugh hysterically but the point is clear.  They know they're being defecated upon.  They know that their government, specifically the present administration, has contempt for them and for the strata to which they belong.Not one important person in the Bush administration went to Vietnam or has served in any other armed conflict; not Bush, not Cheney, not Rummy...Support the Troops.  You see the ribbons on the back of all the SUV's.  We all know what it really means: Support the War.  The same neo-cons who stomp all over minorities all the time and condemn the poor on principle, have co-opted the troops - a group which consists mostly of poor minorities.  Unbelievable.A good portion of the film's soundtrack is provided by the young black inner-city kids fighting for Haliburton and its ilk in Iraq.  The streets of Baghdad are alive with angry hip hop.
