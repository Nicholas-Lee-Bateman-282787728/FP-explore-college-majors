I'd heard of The People's Choice with the talking dog, but never got to see it until it became available through this offering.I have to say I was highly entertained & found Jackie Cooper enchanting & very pleasant to watch.  Cleo who is almost as adorable comes a close second.  I never knew Mr. Cooper had done a series as an adult where he was a weekly performer.  He handled the part beautifully.I only wish MORE of this series were available.If this were to ever get released as full season sets, I'd buy them up as I'm sure many others would.Perhaps we can make inquiries to Alpha Video regarding future installments?",5,Jackie Cooper was so loveable ;-),1304208000,"05 1, 2011",2011,728,"['Jackie', 'Cooper', 'had', 'great', 'personality', 'sense', 'humor', 'only', 'remembered', 'Little', 'Rascals', ""'d"", 'heard', 'People', 'Choice', 'talking', 'dog', 'never', 'got', 'see', 'became', 'available', 'offering.I', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'highly', 'entertained', 'found', 'Jackie', 'Cooper', 'enchanting', 'very', 'pleasant', 'watch', 'Cleo', 'who', 'almost', 'adorable', 'close', 'second', 'never', 'knew', 'Mr.', 'Cooper', 'had', 'done', 'series', 'adult', 'where', 'was', 'weekly', 'performer', 'handled', 'part', 'only', 'wish', 'MORE', 'series', 'were', 'available.If', 'were', 'ever', 'get', 'released', 'full', 'season', 'sets', ""'d"", 'buy', 'up', ""'m"", 'sure', 'many', 'others', 'can', 'make', 'inquiries', 'Alpha', 'Video', 'regarding', 'future', 'installments']","The People's Choice, Volume 1"

I was about 7 or 8, and I roared with delight every time Cleo, the dog, said something to criticize the behavior of the humans. Watching the dog drag it's sideways butt across the floor was also amusing. This is something you can show to your kids, and your kid's kids. A great sitcom, and Jackie Cooper and Patricia Breslin had a chemistry that has rarely been equalled.
