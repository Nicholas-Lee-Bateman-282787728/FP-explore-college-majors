It's almost criminal how Warner Brothers has treated this show for the home video market.  Season 1 got a wide DVD release, Season 2 was MOD and Season 3 is nowhere to be found.  Season 4 is uncertain as well.With TNT renewing this for a 5th season, I think it's time for them to get their act together and realize there is a demand for this show and it does have a solid fanbase that will support it.Season 4 was a interesting season for the show.  Some of the characters took a darker turn and another had a major life changing event happen.  It also featured a solid recurring guest star, Lucy Liu, who brought alot of fire and intensity to the show as Officer John Cooper (Michael Cudlitz) new partner.  She also comes with alot of baggage and a dark past.Warner Brothers, Get this show on DVD ASAP!!",5,Best Cop Show on TV!

When everyone is &#34;out in the field&#34; and it's switching between locations the editing makes it sharp, crisp, and dynamic. Very effective and it holds your attention. And, this 4th Season with Lucy Lui was a kick.
