1010527,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000H6SXSI,A Customer,"[12, 15]","Sly, acerbic and totally irreverent Art School Confidential has fun skewering the world of art colleges, offering up a delectable mix of characters. The film exudes a peppy confidence with director Terry Zwigoff's and Daniel Clowes - who wrote the script - obviously having a lot of fun satirizing this institution of higher learning.The film however, especially during the last half, tends to lose its way a bit with multiple subplots, involving a campus murderer and it becomes a mishmash that isn't particularly hard to follow, but doesn't really pack the caustic punch of the first act.The shy, sensitive and totally virginal Jerome Platz (Max Minghella) is totally stoked to have a place at the Strathmore Art Academy. A Picasso aspirant from the New Jersey suburbs, Jerome enthusiastically enrolls in the school only to have his obvious talent - he's the only one in the class producing anything recognizable as art - not just disregarded, but mocked.Jerome's cynical and preoccupied Professor Sandiford (John Malkovich) who supervises him in the life-drawing class is more concerned with promoting the work of class hunk and obvious art dunce Jonah (Matt Keeslar), who also impresses the students and faculty with his flashy but rather unsophisticated paintings.But Jerome also has a romantic cross to bear. He has a desperate crush on life model Audrey (Sophia Myles), yet he feels as though he just doesn't meet her standards, especially when she starts courting Jonah.  As you might expect, Jerome ends up completely cynical about romance, relationships and the art scene, and his place in it.Encouragement comes in the form of his wise mentors in Professor Sandiford and the washed-up, alcoholic and profanity spewing Strathmore graduate Jimmy (Jim Broadbent). Jerome eventually pays the ultimate price for artistic notoriety and at first he fails miserably to get noticed despite his being more talented than anyone in the class, including Professor Sandiford.It is only when Jerome begins cheating and stealing others' work that he starts getting the attention that invariably leads to success. This fame, however, comes at a price and he ends up becoming the prime suspect in a series of series of murders taking place around the campus.Max Minghella is very good in the role of Jerome and he instills his character with just the right amount of boyish innocence and ""straightness"" that indeed makes him look like a fish out of water amongst all the bohemians. But at times he's so innocuous and demure that he tends to get lost amidst all the ribald, particularly when he's up against the inherently funny Ethan Suplee as Jerome's blowhard roommate.The true scene-stealers, however, are Mr. Broadbent and Mr. Malkovich, who give the funniest and most sardonic performances in the film. Malkovich's droll and deadpan interpretation of the role of art teacher underscores the movie's absurdity. Nobody is better at playing haughtiness and self-importance - Sandiford is far more concerned with propping up his own failing career that worrying about his students.Jim Broadbent also has some marvelously cockamamie moments as he swigs down booze and yells lewd epithets to Jerome. This art school seems to be existing on borrowed time - the students are zany and the teachers look tired and lack commitment, and distain pretension; it's world in which catastrophes are commonplace, and true talent is not properly appraised, and where the problem is never ""selling out,"" but learning how to ""buy in.""

1010528,ADBEG8PLO3OMC,B000H6SXSI,"A. Johnson ""Jason Hex""","[1, 1]","Daniel Clowes is a master of the uncomfortable moment. His cartoons have the uncanny effect of recreating one's own worst missteps, perceptual errors, personal demons and intimations of failure. Which is one reason, I suppose, that this brilliant movie, based on Clowes' actual experiences in art school, has been almost universally damned by Amazon's critics.This is a shame. The movie features some of the greatest actors working today (Anjelica Huston, John Malkovich, Jim Broadbent), a ferociously tight script by Clowes, and is directed by Terry Zwigoff (who also made Crumb and Bad Santa and previously collaborated with Clowes on the unforgettable Ghost World).Art School Confidential stars Max Minghella as Jerome Platz, a shy, sensitive and ambitious kid with dreams of being the next Picasso. True to Clowesian form, his artwork is ridiculed by fellow students and professors alike--they call his work derivative, lacking soul, inhuman, like something drawn by a machine. The fact that it is perfectly rendered and makes his fellow students' stuff look like the amateur crap that it is draws a bead of jealousy to his solemn brow. His roommates are an outrageously over-the-top would-be movie director, a sort of cross between Quentin Tarentino and Jim Morrison, and a fashion major in severe denial about his sexuality. Platz falls heavily for art model Audrey (played by Sophia Myles), who seems like a dream come true--gorgeous, good-hearted and unaffected, Audrey connects with Jerome at a deep emotional level.Needless to say if you're familiar with Clowes' work, Jerome is destined for a harsh dunking in the reality bucket. Audrey falls for a strappingly handsome, broad-shouldered new student, Jonah (Matt Keeslar), whose ultra-naive paintings become the hit of the school. Jerome begins to adopt the philosophy and mannerisms of the Satanic alum portrayed by Jim Broadbent, a foul slob who's drinking himself to death in a filthy apartment between bouts of masturbation to ""The Facts of Life."" Meanwhile, a serial strangler is stalking the campus, piling up the body count and providing story material for Platz's room-mate, who is making an Uli Lommel-like true crime movie about the killer.To say more would spoil the slender plot, but what makes this movie more than worth the price of the ticket is its exceptionally well-drawn (pun sorta intentional) characters and its harrowing depiction of the cant, hypocrisy, pretension, greed and sheer vapidity that drives the art school and its affiliates (look for Steve Buscemi as ""Broadway Bob,"" the crass owner of a local gallery cum coffee house). There's few actually likable characters and quite a number of bizarre hipster types that should be familiar to anyone who's attended college within the last 20 years. Don't expect a happy ending, although you may get one anyway--Clowes-style, of course, with that faint hum of ambiguity that gives his satirical comics the air of realism. Although Art School Confidential comes second to the impeccable Ghost World, it's a great introduction to Clowes inky universe.",5,Vintage Clowes--a Dark Love Story,1305158400,"05 12, 2011",2011,3084,"['Daniel', 'Clowes', 'master', 'uncomfortable', 'moment', 'cartoons', 'have', 'uncanny', 'effect', 'recreating', 'one', 'own', 'worst', 'missteps', 'perceptual', 'errors', 'personal', 'demons', 'intimations', 'failure', 'Which', 'one', 'reason', 'suppose', 'brilliant', 'movie', 'based', 'Clowes', 'actual', 'experiences', 'art', 'school', 'been', 'almost', 'universally', 'damned', 'Amazon', 'critics.This', 'shame', 'movie', 'greatest', 'actors', 'working', 'today', 'Anjelica', 'Huston', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'ferociously', 'tight', 'script', 'Clowes', 'directed', 'Terry', 'Zwigoff', 'who', 'also', 'made', 'Crumb', 'Bad', 'Santa', 'previously', 'collaborated', 'Clowes', 'unforgettable', 'Ghost', 'World', '.Art', 'School', 'Confidential', 'stars', 'Max', 'Minghella', 'Jerome', 'Platz', 'shy', 'sensitive', 'ambitious', 'kid', 'dreams', 'being', 'next', 'Picasso', 'True', 'Clowesian', 'form', 'artwork', 'ridiculed', 'fellow', 'students', 'professors', 'alike', 'call', 'work', 'derivative', 'lacking', 'soul', 'inhuman', 'something', 'drawn', 'machine', 'fact', 'perfectly', 'rendered', 'fellow', 'students', 'stuff', 'look', 'amateur', 'crap', 'bead', 'jealousy', 'solemn', 'brow', 'roommates', 'are', 'outrageously', 'over-the-top', 'would-be', 'movie', 'director', 'sort', 'cross', 'Quentin', 'Tarentino', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'fashion', 'major', 'severe', 'denial', 'sexuality', 'Platz', 'heavily', 'art', 'model', 'Audrey', 'played', 'Sophia', 'Myles', 'who', 'dream', 'come', 'true', 'gorgeous', 'good-hearted', 'unaffected', 'Audrey', 'Jerome', 'deep', 'emotional', 'level.Needless', 'say', ""'re"", 'familiar', 'Clowes', 'work', 'Jerome', 'destined', 'harsh', 'dunking', 'reality', 'bucket', 'Audrey', 'strappingly', 'handsome', 'broad-shouldered', 'new', 'student', 'Jonah', 'Matt', 'Keeslar', 'ultra-naive', 'paintings', 'become', 'hit', 'school', 'Jerome', 'adopt', 'philosophy', 'mannerisms', 'Satanic', 'alum', 'portrayed', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'foul', 'slob', 'who', 'drinking', 'death', 'filthy', 'apartment', 'bouts', 'masturbation', 'Facts', 'Life', 'Meanwhile', 'serial', 'strangler', 'stalking', 'campus', 'piling', 'up', 'body', 'count', 'providing', 'story', 'material', 'Platz', 'room-mate', 'who', 'making', 'Uli', 'Lommel-like', 'true', 'crime', 'movie', 'killer.To', 'say', 'more', 'would', 'spoil', 'slender', 'plot', 'what', 'movie', 'more', 'price', 'ticket', 'exceptionally', 'well-drawn', 'pun', 'sorta', 'intentional', 'characters', 'harrowing', 'depiction', 'cant', 'hypocrisy', 'pretension', 'greed', 'sheer', 'vapidity', 'art', 'school', 'affiliates', 'look', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'Broadway', 'Bob', 'crass', 'owner', 'local', 'gallery', 'cum', 'coffee', 'house', 'few', 'actually', 'likable', 'characters', 'quite', 'number', 'bizarre', 'hipster', 'types', 'should', 'be', 'familiar', 'anyone', 'who', 'attended', 'college', 'last', '20', 'years', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'happy', 'ending', 'may', 'get', 'one', 'anyway', 'Clowes-style', 'course', 'faint', 'hum', 'ambiguity', 'satirical', 'comics', 'air', 'realism', 'Art', 'School', 'Confidential', 'second', 'impeccable', 'Ghost', 'World', 'great', 'introduction', 'Clowes', 'inky', 'universe']",N/A

Directed by Terry Zwigoff with a screenplay written by Daniel Clowes based on a comic book, also by Clowes, it really nails the pretentious Art School atmosphere. Clowes based his story on the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn--they even use minimalist paintings he did while a student there for Jonah, a character who is only pretending to be an artist. A lot of the students are so clich&eacute;--but that is entirely intentional. The students and faculty may all be studies in clich&eacute;, but they are rendered in such excruciating detail. It seems that Art School attracts the same types semester after semester, as Bardo, a student who keeps dropping out and returning tells Jerome, the neophyte, after enumerating the archetypes:------------------------------Bardo: I'm a living clich&eacute; just like the rest of these guys.============================================John Malkovich plays the pompous and burned out Professor Sandiford who imparts the following advice:----------------------------------Professor Sandiford: Now I don't have any particular wisdom to impart to you people, except to say this, these four words - don't have unrealistic expectations. If you want to make money, you might as well drop out right now; go to banking school, or website school - anywhere but art school. And remember, only 1 out of 100 of you will ever make a living as an artist.===============================================Rather than just a collection of clich&eacute;s the story unfolds in a way that is not only funny and entertaining but actually illuminates the intersection of Art, Talent, Fame, and Infamy. Great performances by Max Minghella and Sophia Myles as Jerome, the young artist, and Audrey, the figure model he pursues. Myles goes the distance as the daughter of a semi famous artist who takes the Art World that Jerome so desperately craves to be a part of for granted. She is his muse and inspiration, and though she sees through the pretentiousness of the Art Scene, she is not immune to the charms of a sincere young artist with talent.Bad Santa(2003) ....

Yet, in a weird way, Zwigoff chose not only to let Art School satirize itself, he let real human emotions and frustrations play out, and it WORKS brilliantly.Jerome Platz (Max Minghella) is striving to be the greatest artist of all time, and what artist isn't. So, when his works are overlooked in class, his frustration begins to boil. What's worse than people criticizing your work? When they ignore it completely. What makes great art? What makes artists memorable or unforgettable?What makes ART SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL such an enjoyable viewing experience over all the other junk, is the depth of story and the richness of characters. There is so much going on and it all comes together beautifully. An independent film, a beautiful model named Audrey (Sophia Myles) who becomes Jerome's obsession, an art Professor named Sandiford (John Malkovich) that is struggling himself to become something more than forgettable, a washed up former artist and alcoholic bum named Jimmy, a serial strangler on campus, a battle for supremacy in the classroom and a search for what makes something art and what makes something trash.Jim Broadbent, Ethan Suplee, Joel Moore, Matt Keeslar, John Malkovich, Marshall Bell & Steve Buscemi all round out the cast that come together in different and hilarious ways that will have you glued and enjoying one of the most satisfying movie experiences you'll find these days. Not to mention, will give you twists and turns that keep you interested till the credits roll.",4,"FUNNY, REAL & Darkly Creative",1161129600,"10 18, 2006",2006,2036,"['was', 'really', 'surprised', 'ART', 'SCHOOL', 'CONFIDENTIAL', 'had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'film', 'positive', 'reviews', 'drew', 'Wow', 'was', 'glad', 'did', 'unconventional', 'storytelling', 'finest.If', ""'re"", 'tired', 'wading', 'shelves', 'shelves', 'unsatisfying', 'movies', 'litter', 'video', 'store', 'shelves', 'try', 'ART', 'SCHOOL', 'CONFIDENTIAL', 'little', 'bit', 'everything', 'everybody.Directed', 'Terry', 'Zwigoff', 'who', 'gave', 'movies', 'BAD', 'SANTA', 'GHOSTWORLD', 'intent', 'ART', 'SCHOOL', 'CONFIDENTIAL', 'satire', 'make', 'fun', 'ART', 'SCHOOL', 'weird', 'way', 'Zwigoff', 'chose', 'not', 'only', 'let', 'Art', 'School', 'satirize', 'let', 'real', 'human', 'emotions', 'frustrations', 'play', 'out', 'WORKS', 'brilliantly.Jerome', 'Platz', 'Max', 'Minghella', 'striving', 'be', 'greatest', 'artist', 'time', 'what', 'artist', ""n't"", 'So', 'when', 'works', 'are', 'overlooked', 'class', 'frustration', 'boil', 'What', 'worse', 'people', 'criticizing', 'work', 'When', 'ignore', 'completely', 'What', 'great', 'art', 'What', 'artists', 'memorable', 'unforgettable', 'What', 'ART', 'SCHOOL', 'CONFIDENTIAL', 'enjoyable', 'viewing', 'experience', 'other', 'junk', 'depth', 'story', 'richness', 'characters', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'together', 'beautifully', 'independent', 'film', 'beautiful', 'model', 'named', 'Audrey', 'Sophia', 'Myles', 'who', 'Jerome', 'obsession', 'art', 'Professor', 'named', 'Sandiford', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'struggling', 'become', 'something', 'more', 'forgettable', 'washed', 'up', 'former', 'artist', 'alcoholic', 'bum', 'named', 'Jimmy', 'serial', 'strangler', 'campus', 'battle', 'supremacy', 'classroom', 'search', 'what', 'something', 'art', 'what', 'something', 'trash.Jim', 'Broadbent', 'Ethan', 'Suplee', 'Joel', 'Moore', 'Matt', 'Keeslar', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'Marshall', 'Bell', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'round', 'cast', 'come', 'together', 'different', 'hilarious', 'ways', 'will', 'have', 'glued', 'enjoying', 'one', 'most', 'satisfying', 'movie', 'experiences', ""'ll"", 'find', 'days', 'Not', 'mention', 'will', 'give', 'twists', 'keep', 'interested', 'credits', 'roll']",N/A

This film was one of those that I had been interested in for awhile but avoided renting it, mainly just out of other choices being there. On a whim, I decided to rent it and while I don't regret my rental, it's one of those cases where you like what you saw but 10 minutes later you're like ""hey wait a minute, I do have issues with it"".In a great parody of art elitism and misguided praise, Jerome is a talented artist who goes to an art school but finds a bunch of people who praise the most simplest art or the most banal. He tries different styles but he's called a rip-off or a copier, or as his professor puts it: ""trying to sing with your own voice using someone else's vocals cords"". He thinks he's found his muse: a beautiful art model named Audrey. However, he's got competition in Jonah: one of the artists of the aforementioned simple art. So he tries to win her back somehow with a subplot involving a serial killer on campus.Honestly, this is one of the few films that I actually didn't predict the story all the way through. Sure certain things happened that were kind of obvious but by and large there was quite a few twists that I didn't really see coming. However, the way it's all resolved at the end felt like a bad taste in my mouth. It's one of those kind of endings you watch and go ""uh...isn't there supposed to be more?"" Certain characters as well are also in the film. One of the film's stars, Anjelica Huston is literally in 2 scenes and certain plotlines don't really feel finished either but they're very minor nitpicks.The satirical parts are probably one of the better parts of the film. In one scene, people praise a woman's very preschool-ish self portrait while they don't even acknowledge Jerome's well-made one(one student even calls it ""robotic""). The acting also is pretty good but certain characters we would've got great mileage out of barely get any scenes. Katherine Moennig from the L Word and Anjelica Huston have very small screen time that it makes you wonder why they're even in here and one of Jerome's roommates with a secret comes out of left field so it's like ""oh yeah, he's here too"".Should you watch it?

1010538,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000H6SXSI,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[3, 6]","Substanceless substance.  As I sit here trying to figure out how I can possibly even begin to review such an innovative, complex film as Art School Confidential, those are the words that come most prominently to mind.  This film has a lot to say, especially about life and art (and most of it is pretty negative).  I don't think it wholly succeeds in the end, but it's still a fascinating movie.  Even when and where it fails, it does so gloriously and originally - due in no small part to a fabulous cast that includes the likes of John Malkovich, Anjelica Huston, and Jim Broadbent in secondary roles.Max Minghella plays Jerome Platz, a young man who dreams of becoming the greatest artist of the twenty-first century.  After twelve years of public education and innumerable beatings from bullies, he finally begins his life's journey by enrolling at Strathmore, a supposedly prestigious fine arts school that turns out to be less than Jerome thought it to be.  It's located in a really bad part of town, its teachers aren't the kind of dedicated mentors he was expecting, and his fellow students run the gamut from shiftless losers to infuriatingly pretentious twits.  One of his professors spent twenty-five years learning to draw triangles that no one, to his great surprise, seems the least bit interested in buying.  If you're like me and just don't ""get"" modern art, you'll get a kick out of watching these students go on and on about the symbolism and incredible brilliance of artworks that only Jerome seems capable of recognizing as junk.  He's the only decent artist in the whole school, but all of his work is belittled and branded derivative.  When Jonah (Matt Keeslar) becomes the star pupil with an infantile piece he obviously threw together in about five minutes (it's a drawing of a car pasted on to a poster, people), Jerome really begins to crash and burn.  The influence of Jimmy (Jim Broadbent), the biggest loser and most bitter and pathetic of Swarthmore art graduates, only furthers Jerome's downward spiral - well, that and the fact that Audrey (Sophia Myles), a nude model and the girl of his dreams, increasingly seems to favor the company of Jonah.There also just happens to be a serial strangler on the loose in the area.  Maybe you're wondering how art and murder go together, but the two really converge in this film to frame the ending and determine the overall theme of the story.  Some professional reviewers seem to think the serial killer subplot is distracting and unnecessary; I find that rather amazing because this part of the story is crucial to the film's central theme.The movie is adapted from Clowes' Eightball graphic novels, with Terry Zwigoff directing, making this the second collaborative effort by these two (the first was the much more successful Ghost World).  Much of it was apparently inspired by Daniel Clowes' own experiences at art school, where he basically learned that one's merit is a far less determiner of success than one's connections.  I have a hard time even classifying this thing; it's biting satire, art criticism, a character study, and a coming of age film all wrapped up into one.  There may actually be too much to this film, which helps explain why it comes up a little short in the end.  The plot isn't difficult to predict in some respects, and the negativity of the film may leave a bad taste in some viewers' mouths, but, in my opinion, Art School Confidential is a pretty compelling film - because of rather than in spite of its decidedly cynical outlook.",4,A compellingly bitter film sure to inspire a wide range of reactions,1169769600,"01 26, 2007",2007,3538,"['Substanceless', 'substance', 'sit', 'here', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'can', 'possibly', 'even', 'begin', 'review', 'innovative', 'complex', 'film', 'Art', 'School', 'Confidential', 'are', 'words', 'come', 'most', 'prominently', 'mind', 'film', 'lot', 'say', 'especially', 'life', 'art', 'most', 'pretty', 'negative', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'wholly', 'end', 'still', 'fascinating', 'movie', 'Even', 'when', 'where', 'so', 'gloriously', 'originally', 'due', 'small', 'part', 'fabulous', 'cast', 'likes', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'Anjelica', 'Huston', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'secondary', 'roles.Max', 'Minghella', 'Jerome', 'Platz', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'becoming', 'greatest', 'artist', 'twenty-first', 'century', 'twelve', 'years', 'public', 'education', 'innumerable', 'beatings', 'bullies', 'finally', 'life', 'journey', 'enrolling', 'Strathmore', 'supposedly', 'prestigious', 'fine', 'arts', 'school', 'out', 'be', 'less', 'Jerome', 'thought', 'be', 'located', 'really', 'bad', 'part', 'town', 'teachers', 'are', ""n't"", 'kind', 'dedicated', 'mentors', 'was', 'expecting', 'fellow', 'students', 'run', 'gamut', 'shiftless', 'losers', 'infuriatingly', 'pretentious', 'twits', 'One', 'professors', 'spent', 'twenty-five', 'years', 'learning', 'draw', 'triangles', 'one', 'great', 'surprise', 'least', 'bit', 'interested', 'buying', ""'re"", 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'modern', 'art', ""'ll"", 'get', 'kick', 'watching', 'students', 'go', 'symbolism', 'incredible', 'brilliance', 'artworks', 'only', 'Jerome', 'capable', 'recognizing', 'junk', 'only', 'decent', 'artist', 'whole', 'school', 'work', 'belittled', 'branded', 'derivative', 'When', 'Jonah', 'Matt', 'Keeslar', 'star', 'pupil', 'infantile', 'piece', 'obviously', 'threw', 'together', 'about', 'five', 'minutes', 'drawing', 'car', 'pasted', 'poster', 'people', 'Jerome', 'really', 'crash', 'burn', 'influence', 'Jimmy', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'biggest', 'loser', 'most', 'bitter', 'pathetic', 'Swarthmore', 'art', 'graduates', 'only', 'Jerome', 'downward', 'spiral', 'well', 'fact', 'Audrey', 'Sophia', 'Myles', 'nude', 'model', 'girl', 'dreams', 'increasingly', 'favor', 'company', 'Jonah.There', 'also', 'just', 'be', 'serial', 'strangler', 'loose', 'area', 'Maybe', ""'re"", 'wondering', 'how', 'art', 'murder', 'go', 'together', 'two', 'really', 'converge', 'film', 'frame', 'ending', 'determine', 'overall', 'theme', 'story', 'professional', 'reviewers', 'seem', 'think', 'serial', 'killer', 'subplot', 'distracting', 'unnecessary', 'find', 'rather', 'amazing', 'part', 'story', 'crucial', 'film', 'central', 'theme.The', 'movie', 'adapted', 'Clowes', 'Eightball', 'graphic', 'novels', 'Terry', 'Zwigoff', 'directing', 'making', 'second', 'collaborative', 'effort', 'two', 'first', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'successful', 'Ghost', 'World', 'Much', 'was', 'apparently', 'inspired', 'Daniel', 'Clowes', 'own', 'experiences', 'art', 'school', 'where', 'basically', 'learned', 'one', 'merit', 'far', 'less', 'determiner', 'success', 'one', 'connections', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'even', 'classifying', 'thing', 'biting', 'satire', 'art', 'criticism', 'character', 'study', 'coming', 'age', 'film', 'wrapped', 'up', 'one', 'may', 'actually', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'explain', 'why', 'up', 'little', 'short', 'end', 'plot', ""n't"", 'difficult', 'predict', 'respects', 'negativity', 'film', 'may', 'leave', 'bad', 'taste', 'viewers', 'mouths', 'opinion', 'Art', 'School', 'Confidential', 'pretty', 'compelling', 'film', 'rather', 'spite', 'decidedly', 'cynical', 'outlook']",N/A

Well, the tone of the movie is set with a lecture from an art star in a state art college where he proves that all successful artists are a-holes who don't owe anyone anything and who have nothing to offer. From here on, everyone is pretty much as the art star describes: washed-up professors jumping at any chance to exhibit, moody women who lash out at men, kids who just want to get laid, bulls--tters. Oh, and our 'protagonist' (I usually need a fair amount of character development to apply this label, but hey I'm not Terry Zwigoff) who is an innocent in this sea of cynicism complete with doe-eyed looks and ability to draw like a master. We're actually supposed to have an 'epiphany' moment in the film as he draws a beautiful female model that is complete with slow camera movements and disolves and string quartet music. Give me a break.  Oh, and there is some lame subplot about a murderer or something too.What could have been a more subtle (and more effective) satire is instead a script that seems like it sat on a shelf for ten years that offers nothing more than stereotype layered upon cynicism.  Fine, Dan Clowes got his ""revenge"" on art institutions for shunning his genius back when he was a freshman. Big deal. If art school is a sham, it is no less than any other academic institution.

In fact, compared to most Hollywood comedies, it's relatively sharp and insightful. However, it's also unfocused, cluttered, cheap, and just feels rushed. If anything, the script could have used one or two more passes. The characters are bland and one-dimensional. Max Minghella, while an attractive young man with idealism written all over his expressive face, can't quite pull it off as a leading man. John Malkovich, spectacularly underplaying a jaded, defeated, teacher and wannabe ""Celebrity Artist"" never has any moments in which he is allowed to do anything with the character.  The same can be said of  Jim Broadbent and Steve Buscemi, both capable actors stuck in roles that lock them into uninteresting and stereotypical characters of no depth.It seemed, on some level, that the filmmakers knew their audience (i.e. those of us who have attended art school, or taken our share of art/film/theater classes) and decided that they had the option of scaling back the effort, since our memories would fill in the blanks. The result is a film where the scenes play out like short vignettes, meant to evoke laughter rather than building character or advancing the paper-thin plot. While not a problem in more accomplished comedies, here the ""bits"" are often unfunny, more observational than comical, and they end up signaling the audience to the missed potential for a really spectacular comedic moment.As an example, early on a student returns to the school, now a celebrity artist, and is interviewed by a pompous, long-winded, James Lipton-esque teacher in front of an auditorium of students. The alum then insults the teacher, and the attending students in an unremarkable, certainly unmemorable way, and the scene ends. It was in this moment that I realized what was happening. I wanted to laugh with this film. I wanted it to be funny. I wanted to recognize my younger self and those I attended art school with, and laugh at my own expense and naivet&eacute;. More than anything, I wanted to like the movie. But it didn't happen. The stereotypes were far from amusing, and lacked insight. I.e. The student who kisses up to professors, or the film school student who has all of the accoutrement of and acts like someone who's already working in the industry. These stereotypes aren't localized to the world of the art school. You run into the same thing in medical school, law school, and really any school. I mean, I'm sure that there's a guy at some forestry school in the Northwest who always follows the professor after class telling him about the time he went on an expedition to tag bears in the Alaskan wilderness. Broad stereotypes and bland characters don't mix for good comedy.In the end, the film falls flat with a murder-mystery element that seems tacked on and a mixed message that seems to say ""Stay true to yourself and idealistic and your dreams can come true. Oh, but they won't so you're just wasting your time, ha ha."" But considering the rest of the clutter here, it probably won't matter.If you're under the age of 23 and you really haven't experienced much beyond the sheltered world of college and parentally subsidized ""emergency"" credit cards, then this film will likely reaffirm everything you think you know about the ""art school experience."" For everyone else, you'll probably find this film to be as useful as a bachelor's degree in sculpture.",2,"""You just don't get it""",1149120000,"06 1, 2006",2006,4851,"['1', 'Did', 'go', 'art',

1010542,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000H6SXSI,Ed Uyeshima,"[3, 5]","There is one absolutely hilarious moment in this 2006 black comedy where the film's protagonist, 18-year old Jerome Platz, has come home for Thanksgiving and mentions that his girlfriend's artist father is becoming his mentor. How his parents react to at least one part of the news is priceless. Despite the persistently satirical tone, the rest of the movie is somewhat unwieldy, starting off well if rather predictably but then evolving into an odd hybrid genre that is comparatively less interesting in the second half. Directed by Terry Zwigoff and written by Daniel Clowes, the same team who made 2001's ""Ghost World"", the plot focuses squarely on the seemingly soft-spoken and virginal Jerome, who goes to Strathmore Art School with the vague objective of becoming like his idol Picasso as both master artist and equally master womanizer.As he hangs out with Bardo, a slacker who is a recurring student at the school, Jerome meets the girl of his dreams, a pretty, saucy classroom model named Audrey, and an angry philosophizing hermit named Jimmy, who is himself a failed artist late in middle age with little hope for salvation. We follow Jerome as he tries to make an impression in the eccentric Professor Sandiford's class despite having both romantic and artistic competition from the good-looking, taciturn Jonah, who is receiving praise for his primitive art. Meanwhile, there is a campus slasher lurking about, and Jerome has one roommate named Vince, an underground filmmaker obsessed with the murder spree. It all merges together in an unexpected way, but the movie unfortunately loses a lot of steam before the final plot developments come into play. The result is less than satisfying despite some clever, shrewdly observed moments.As Jerome, Max Minghella (son of director Anthony) brings a plaintive indifference to the role, which may be appropriate for dry satire, but the approach makes it hard to root for him as the film progresses. Nonetheless, a game cast surrounds him with John Malkovich particularly funny as Sandiford and a surprisingly cast Jim Broadbent showcasing nihilistic fury as Jimmy. Sophia Myles plays Audrey with sharp intelligence, while Ethan Suplee (from ""My Name Is Earl"") and Joel David Moore play Vince and Bardo, respectively, to their accustomed stereotypes. In glorified cameos are Steve Buscemi as local art caf&eacute; owner Broadway Bob and Anjelica Huston as a supportive art history teacher. Even without a commentary track by Zwigoff, a surprising omission, there are plenty of extras with the DVD beginning with a brief making-of featurette and a seven-minute short on the film's premiere at Sundance. There are also several deleted and extended scenes, a rather mild blooper reel, and a ""testimonial"" clip of Jerome's fellow students reacting to his fate at the end of the movie.",3,Initially Sharp Dark Comedy Set at an Art School Fritters Away Its Uniqueness in the Second Half,1162684800,"11 5, 2006",2006,2838,"['one', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'moment', '2006', 'black', 'comedy', 'where', 'film', 'protagonist', '18-year', 'old', 'Jerome', 'Platz', 'come', 'home', 'Thanksgiving', 'mentions', 'girlfriend', 'artist', 'father', 'becoming', 'mentor', 'How', 'parents', 'react', 'least', 'one', 'part', 'news', 'priceless', 'persistently', 'satirical', 'tone', 'rest', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'unwieldy', 'starting', 'off', 'well', 'rather', 'predictably', 'then', 'evolving', 'odd', 'hybrid', 'genre', 'comparatively', 'less', 'interesting', 'second', 'half', 'Directed', 'Terry', 'Zwigoff', 'written', 'Daniel', 'Clowes', 'same', 'team', 'who', 'made', '2001', 'Ghost', 'World', 'plot', 'squarely', 'seemingly', 'soft-spoken', 'virginal', 'Jerome', 'who', 'Strathmore', 'Art', 'School', 'vague', 'objective', 'becoming', 'idol', 'Picasso', 'master', 'artist', 'equally', 'master', 'womanizer.As', 'out', 'Bardo', 'slacker', 'who', 'recurring', 'student', 'school', 'Jerome', 'girl', 'dreams', 'pretty', 'saucy', 'classroom', 'model', 'named', 'Audrey', 'angry', 'philosophizing', 'hermit', 'named', 'Jimmy', 'who', 'failed', 'artist', 'late', 'middle', 'age', 'little', 'hope', 'salvation', 'follow', 'Jerome', 'make', 'impression', 'eccentric', 'Professor', 'Sandiford', 'class', 'having', 'romantic', 'artistic', 'competition', 'good-looking', 'taciturn', 'Jonah', 'who', 'receiving', 'praise', 'primitive', 'art', 'Meanwhile', 'campus', 'slasher', 'lurking', 'Jerome', 'one', 'roommate', 'named', 'Vince', 'underground', 'filmmaker', 'obsessed', 'murder', 'spree', 'together', 'unexpected', 'way', 'movie', 'unfortunately', 'lot', 'steam', 'final', 'plot', 'developments', 'come', 'play', 'result', 'less', 'satisfying', 'clever', 'shrewdly', 'observed', 'moments.As', 'Jerome', 'Max', 'Minghella', 'son', 'director', 'Anthony', 'plaintive', 'indifference', 'role', 'may', 'be', 'appropriate', 'dry', 'satire', 'approach', 'hard', 'root', 'film', 'Nonetheless', 'game', 'cast', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'particularly', 'funny', 'Sandiford', 'surprisingly', 'cast', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'showcasing', 'nihilistic', 'fury', 'Jimmy', 'Sophia', 'Myles', 'Audrey', 'sharp', 'intelligence', 'Ethan', 'Suplee', 'Name', 'Earl', 'Joel', 'David', 'Moore', 'play', 'Vince', 'Bardo', 'respectively', 'accustomed', 'stereotypes', 'glorified', 'cameos', 'are', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'local', 'art', 'caf', 'eacute', 'owner', 'Broadway', 'Bob', 'Anjelica', 'Huston', 'supportive', 'art', 'history', 'teacher', 'Even', 'commentary', 'track', 'Zwigoff', 'surprising', 'omission', 'are', 'plenty', 'extras', 'DVD', 'beginning', 'brief', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'seven-minute', 'short', 'film', 'premiere', 'Sundance', 'are', 'also', 'several', 'deleted', 'extended', 'scenes', 'rather', 'mild', 'reel', 'testimonial', 'clip', 'Jerome', 'fellow', 'students', 'reacting', 'fate', 'end', 'movie']",N/A

Jerome is an NYC suburbanite who lands a spot in Strathmore art college. He's genuinely talented but finds talent isn't what propels people into the world of art. He falls for one of the models who is, in turn, falling for another student of questionable talent. Meanwhile, there is a serial strangler on the loose.This is some ugly stuff. It portrays the world of art as having little, if anything, to do with art. The teachers are self-absorbed and are chained to the adage that ""those who can, do. Those who can't, teach."" Jerome's self appointed bud is jaded beyond the meaning of the word and has all their fellow students pegged as types. None of these types have any redeeming qualities. In short, Jerome, and hopefully his gal to be, are the only folks here worth rooting for.Max Minghella is Okay as Jerome. Sophia Myles is decent as Jerome's love interest. John Malkovich is good as professor Sandiford. Steve Buscemi plays Steve Buscemi playing Broadway Bob. Anjelica Huston and Adam Scott have cameos. This is an Okay flick. Not bad. Not great.

The main premise - that art schools are peopled by assorted types of students all with the goal of becoming a great artist and the manner in which attrition occurs - is a solid one and an entertaining tale to tell.  Cluttering that main line of story with a silly stalking strangler idea is just plain dumb and accomplishes little except giving an easy out for a finish.Jerome Platz (Max Minghella) is a talented drawing and painting major who enters the hallowed walls of a respected art school and is stuck with rooming with a film maker Vince (Ethan Suplee), a closeted fashion designer, and nebulous Bardo (Joel Moore) and immediately plugs into the array of misfits that fill the classes including hunky Jonah (Matt Kesslar) who garners attention for his Pop art cars from art teacher cum failed artist Professor Sandiford (John Malkovich).  Jerome's main attraction for the school and the class is his infatuation with life model Audrey (Sophia Myles) who in turn is more attracted to Jonah.  Student questions and life challenges are stepped along by Jerome's contacts with teacher Anjelica Huston, oddball alcoholic recluse artist Jim Broadbent, cafe/arthouse owner Steve Buscemi, gallerist Michael Lerner, established shallow artist Marvin Bushmiller (Adam Scott), etc.  Jerome eventually plagiarizes/steals paintings in hopes of gaining not only some fame in class but also the attention of Audrey.  That little incident unplugs disaster and the film closes with Jerome happily ensconced in jail - grinding out paintings now publicly desired because of his living situation!Sound silly? Well, for the most part it is, but fortunately there are entertaining characters played by some fine actors that maintain our attention.  A funky musical score by David Kitay  borrows heavily from the Big Names in classical music whenever the love interest is aroused and for lovers of classical music the quotations are hilarious.

1010547,A192KEPM0HW6AC,B000H6SXSI,"Interplanetary Funksmanship ""Swift lippin', e...","[5, 6]","What does a true artist live for, deep in his soul?Jerome Platz, artist in training, desperately wants to know. Jimmy, his mentor and drinking buddy, has the answer: ""He lives only for that moment of narcotic bliss that only comes every decade, or once in a lifetime...perhaps, never at all.""But the aging Jimmy--in a dour, virtuoso performance by British character actor Jim Broadbent--has extinguished his divine spark long ago, in a paper coffee cup of Slivovitz liquor. He is but one of many casualties strewn along the path of the cruel and unscrupulous world of postmodern art.In this follow-up to their excellent 2001 sleeper Ghost World, director Terry Zwigoff and screenwriter Daniel Clowes (whose script for Art School Confidential is based on a feature from his comic book series, ""Eightball"") follow Jerome's ambitions and letdowns as a freshman art student. It's a riotously dead-on satire that paints a contemptuous portrait of modern art pretensions.Played with quiet determination by Max Minghella, Jerome is a shy, but very passionate boy who worships Picasso and aspires to become ""the greatest artist of the twenty-first century."" Arriving at the venerable Strathmore Art Institute (modeled after Clowes's alma mater, Brooklyn's Pratt Institute), Jerome navely believes that all he must do to attain his dream is to hone his native talents, find his individual aesthetic style, and--voila!--his work will capture an eager audience among the tastemakers and trendsetters of the New York gallery scene.But, he soon finds out--in a series of soul-crushing blows--that talent and vision don't count nearly as much as creating insipidly empty pieces and latching onto the latest trite ""gimmick."" Here, the movie hits its comedic stride, lampooning every bad art clich&eacute;. Jerome's classes are peopled with a host of ""rebel"" caricatures: the manic-depressive beatnik chick; the ""Vegan Holy Man"" white Rastafarian; the shock ""performance artist""; the sycophantic chameleon; and the blowhard who brags, in circular poststructuralese, that his inept art projects ""have nothing to do with form or texture or color; they're a conscious rejection of spatial dimensions...They're more about the intimacy of the artistic process.""His professors fare hardly better. Most are burnouts, and his drawing instructor, Professor Sandiford (played with a patronizing smirk by John Malkovich), is more concerned with his own exhibition career than in guiding students. When Jerome goes to him for help in seeking a vision, Sandiford tells him he's too young to be so rigid as to have a style: he should experiment with all genres and media. So when Jerome follows the advice, working wildly divergent styles into his final project, he gets back the saboteur prof's written critique: ""Too experimental. Hollow and derivative. You need to be yourself.""Jerome finds kinship only in a fellow student who keeps dropping in and out of classes (Joel David Moore), and in an art history teacher sympathetic to his predicament (Anjelica Huston). But the nascent artist discovers his true inspiration in Audrey (Sophia Myles), whose ethereal beauty and demure calm enthrall him.The scene that intimately acquaints the viewer with Audrey, as she disrobes to model before Jerome's drawing class, is the most sensuously evocative and graceful grand entrance I've seen since Kim Novak's in Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo (1958). Jerome is captivated as she slowly reveals her nude body: Set to the string introduction from the adagio movement of Beethoven's ""Emperor"" Concerto, the music evinces Jerome's inner emotions for Audrey--not only sexually, but as the fulfillment of his quest for an ideal muse. Desirous of her, but also in love with her classical beauty, Jerome sees the otherworldly Audrey as she could be--a real-life Venus de Milo (which, if you've seen Sophia Myles, is not that far a stretch).Sadly, Audrey resists Jerome's awkward advances. Dejected by unrequited love, he realizes that he must be content to love only the idea of her.At this point, a subplot about a serial strangler terrorizing the Strathmore campus takes over. Almost every review I've seen pans the subplot as gratuitous, or as running out of steam. I think they miss the method in Clowes's and Zwigoff's madness. As a plot device, it works perfectly in driving home the film's message: The ""fine arts"" wasteland is so corrupt that the only way for Jerome to get his big break is to take the rap for the murders. Thus, through exploiting the biggest gimmick of all, Jerome finally is free to paint his ideal projects...in the Kafkaesque world of a prison, where he is locked up for crimes he didn't commit.What is intended as an essentially happy ending demonstrates a fundamentally bleak worldview. Audrey, having seen the error in her fickleness, finally commits to Jerome. In an understated closing shot, the two lovers at last engage in a passionate kiss--their lips partitioned by the wire-reinforced glass of a booth in the prison's visiting area, to the strains of the Emperor's Adagio. To Jerome, their passion still remains not fully realized, his Audrey still not fully within reach. The message is that artistic success and love are indeed attainable, but only by alienating oneself from the larger world.This fatalism aside, however, the film is a spot-on satire in its scathing indictment of the backbiting, pettiness, haughty elitism, and sham that is today's art. Art School Confidential is The Fountainhead meets Catcher in the Rye, realized by Mel Brooks. Bitingly it drives home its theme that, in today's public arena of the absurd--where ""controversial"" artists vie to out-shock each other--beauty is truly the most controversial message of all.",4,Speaking Truth to Poseurs,1179619200,"05 20, 2007",2007,5737,"['What', 'true', 'artist', 'live', 'deep', 'soul', 'Jerome', 'Platz', 'artist', 'training', 'desperately', 'know', 'Jimmy',

1010550,AXCVJPP41H8BA,B000H6SXSI,"Jim Van Cise ""Caffeine Anthropologist""","[0, 0]","I don't know how I would pitch this movie to someone who never attended art school. Try to image the typical college stereotypes only with more emphasis on individuality. Everyone pursuing success in a subjective activity&#8211;with opinions that are constantly changing. I'm biased in that I found the best moments of the movie to be the critiques during the classes taught by John Malkovich. Our college freshman main character Jerome, is luckless in finding love and is trying to impress a crush&#8211;a figure model shown in a printed brochure for the school that happens to still work there part-time. Jerome is more technician than artist which quickly draws negative attention from his soul searching classmates. Perhaps they hated Jerome in that they couldn't match him technically and therefore couldn't put their visions on canvas. Jerome was safe and invisible during critiques until he started freely offering his opinions. Jerome got frustrated quickly with classmates who are struggling to find ways to express themselves through their art&#8211;only they are even worse at explaining it. Jerome was offended that the professor accepted what everyone offered as a contribution&#8211;even when it sounded like bs.Every art class has a relaxed atmosphere until the moment of truth (critiques). Then the creations you spent a week on might face rejection. On a day where there is no nude model, it's YOU who is left feeling naked and vulnerable. Jerome can't defend his textbook style portraits when he's made aware that he has no style of his own&#8211; so he tries copying other classmates styles. When that doesn't work he starts to copy the style of the local serial killer.Also, this film accurately captures the mysterious nature of college professors. Outside of class, it's completely plausible that their lives are anything but ordinary. Or 90% reclusive. My favorite moment is a deleted scene where the Malkovich character tries his best to destroy a painted canvas but cannot despite several tries. I should recommend Cashback which is another great flick that is under the radar. Cashback will sound similar in that a troubled art student spends his sleepless hours doing figure drawings of strangers when he discovers he can physically stop time indefinitely. Anywhere.In conclusion, wouldn't it be logical to release a bluray with Ghost World as the second feature? A Daniel Clowes/Terry Zwigoff double feature? Five stars until they allow 4.5 or a better art school movie comes along.

1010551,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B000H6SXSI,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[5, 5]","""Art School Confidential"" is directed by Terry Zwigoff, director of ""Bad Santa"" and is a massively underrated comedy. The movie stars Max Minghella (son of ""Cold Mountain"" writer/director Anthony Minghella),Sophia Myles (who's really hot), John Malkovich (one of the best actors alive), Jim Broadbent (""Gangs of New York""), Ethan Suplee (""My Name is Earl""), Nick Swardson (""Grandma's Boy""), Joel David Moore (also ""Grandma's Boy""), Steve Buscemi (""Fargo""), and Anjelica Huston (""Daddy Day Care""). Minghella plays Jerome Platz, an aspiring artist who begins attending Strathmore Academy. He arrives at a strange time, since a serial killer is terrorizing the grounds (which has, I admit, become cliche). In one class, Professor Sandiford (Malkovich, terrific as always) informs the students that only 1 out of 100 of them will ever make a living as an artist. Jerome is looking to be that one; In fact, he's aiming really high. He wants to be the greatest artist of the 21st century. Then Jerome meets an art model named Audrey (Myles) and spends the rest of the movie trying to win her over. Problem is, a guy named Jonah (Matt Keeslar) seems to be in the running for her affections as well...Although, Jonah isn't quite who he seems to be. This story isn't typical boy-meets-girl kind of material though. Jerome is kind of weird and is very obsessive of Audrey, so when she doesn't ""fall into his arms"" it's not really hard to see why. Swardson and Suplee co-star as Jerome's roommates. One of whom is making a movie about the strangler, the other whom may or not be gay. Huston plays an Art Teacher, Broadbent plays an alcoholic artist, and Buscemi plays the owner of a cafe where most artists get their start showing their work. The biggest problem I had with the film was the ending. It seemed a little forced and overly symbolic. Like the screenwriter though ""OK, yeah, that's great. They kiss through the glass, everyone cheers. Cut to black."" I know a lot of people on Amazon don't seem to like this movie, but it's actually a pretty funny and smartly written comedy.

1010552,A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2,B000H6SXSI,"Kevin L. Nenstiel ""omnivore""","[1, 2]","I had high hopes for this movie.  It's the newest from writer Daniel Clowes and director Terry Zwigoff, the creative team behind Ghost World.  That previous film was the most accurate portrait of contemporary youth in a generation, a movie that reflected how young adults think and talk without the muddy quixotism of John Hughes or the prettified pessimism of Sam Mendes.  This movie, however, is nothing but a mess.Max Minghella plays Jerome, a freshman art student at the Strathmore Institute, which is named for a brand of drawing paper and appears to be based loosely on the New School in New York.  He is nave to the world, inexperienced with girls, and accustomed to being stepped on by those stronger, cooler, and more deceitful than himself.  He hopes that, at an art college, he'll find some kindred spirits and make a more rounded life for himself.Instead he finds that the art world is self-indulgent, his teachers are bored with their whining, needy students, and scoring with girls may not be worth the effort.  He is kept on the outside of the cool crowd, who slap each other on the back for their juvenile stabs at art.  And as if that weren't enough, by the end he's the prime suspect in a serial murder investigation.But what kind of movie is it?  I'm not sure I can answer that.  Is it a sex farce?  A coming of age story?  A social satire?  Or a murder mystery?  Perhaps not even the creative team is too sure, because at the end they try to make it all of those at once.  And the finished product is like a sleeper couch: a compromise of forms that isn't satisfying in any of its functions.The context of the movie clunks badly as well.  Only Jerome is allowed the liberty to move and grow as a character.  Everyone else is set up to give him something to feel bad about.  He has two roommates, a bearlike film student whose only interest is in helping Jerome get laid, and a closeted gay painter whose homosexuality is about as subtle as that of Harvey Fierstein.  Both of them speak at exactly the same pitch and volume throughout the entire movie.Sophia Miles, as the principal love interest Audrey, has some breathless tics and trembles toward the end of the movie that break up her monotony.  But through the main body of the film she plays everything with the same note of vague distracted melancholy.  She doesn't connect with our hero, she doesn't connect with an ex-lover who keeps barging into her life, she doesn't connect with, well, the film.  One wonders whether Miles saw this movie as an acting endeavor or a rent check.The same is true for his teachers and classmates.  Most other characters don't appear to care about anything very deeply, and appear vaguely embarrassed to be in this film.  A few care with great depth and fervor, but they care about everything with the exact same depth, until they come across as having the same global enthusiasm as game show contestants.  Thus even their enthusiasm becomes dull and droning in a big hurry.By the end the whole movie seems as jumbled and adrift as the film-student roommate's final project.

1010553,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B000H6SXSI,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[2, 4]","Art School Confidential is the second movie produced by the indie-art team of Clowes and Zwigoff, the first being 2001's quietly elusive Ghost World, a movie about the harsh worlds and emotional wounds of a trio of silently suffering outsiders.  This sophomore effort concerns yet another misunderstood Man on the Fringe, young Jerome Platz, an artist with hopes for future greatness (played with dewy eyes and permanently-puckered pensiveness by Max Minghella).Like all fresh-faced newbies in any cinematic world, Platz gets the idealism knocked out of his sails by a whole host of jaded characters and events.  From his uninspiring teacher (John Malkovich), to his overly-eager filmmaking roomie (Ethan Suplee), to his artistic muse (a comely nude model played by Sophia Myles), all of them cause Jerome to question not just his creative talent, but his own motives and the world to which they are geared.The film leaps headfirst into the subject matter with brash humor, self-consciously riffing off of the traditional stereotypes, but what starts out as whimsical and snappy turns sluggish and sour.  With the (clunky) introduction of a Mysterious Strangler sub-plot, and with the constant and mawkish lampooning of the art world and its denizens, this otherwise clever and engaging indie film devolves into malicious mean-spiritedness.After all, art is certainly murky with (often pretentious) subjectivism and (occasionally trite) standards of good and bad, but it is, ultimately, a source of redemption and release.  There really is none of that in this flick.  The sarcasm and the increasingly dark stabs at humor and pathos become tangled up in cheap shots and half-starts (see: Platz's ""friendship"" with the cynical Bardo).  The end result is something that is interesting, but also shabby; clever, but also sullen.  It is the indie world's idea of an inside joke.It's just too bad they forgot the punchline.(This DVD comes with some deleted scenes, as well as short clip of a film-premiere that features the cast discussing the making of the movie.  Both are mildly interesting, but nothing much to note on.)",3,Missing The Big Picture,1168560000,"01 12, 2007",2007,2119,"['Art', 'School', 'Confidential', 'second', 'movie', 'produced', 'indie-art', 'team', 'Clowes', 'Zwigoff', 'first', 'being', '2001', 'quietly', 'elusive', 'Ghost', 'World', 'movie', 'harsh', 'worlds', 'emotional', 'wounds', 'trio', 'silently', 'suffering', 'outsiders', 'sophomore', 'effort', 'concerns', 'yet', 'misunderstood', 'Man', 'Fringe', 'young', 'Jerome', 'Platz', 'artist', 'hopes', 'future', 'greatness', 'played', 'dewy', 'eyes', 'permanently-puckered', 'pensiveness', 'Max', 'Minghella', 'fresh-faced', 'newbies', 'cinematic', 'world', 'Platz', 'idealism', 'knocked', 'sails', 'whole', 'host', 'jaded', 'characters', 'events', 'uninspiring', 'teacher', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'overly-eager', 'filmmaking', 'roomie', 'Ethan', 'Suplee', 'artistic', 'muse', 'comely', 'nude', 'model', 'played', 'Sophia', 'Myles', 'cause', 'Jerome', 'question', 'not', 'just', 'creative', 'talent', 'own', 'motives', 'world', 'are', 'geared.The', 'film', 'leaps', 'headfirst', 'subject', 'matter', 'brash', 'humor', 'self-consciously', 'riffing', 'traditional', 'stereotypes', 'what', 'out', 'whimsical', 'snappy', 'turns', 'sluggish', 'sour', 'clunky', 'introduction', 'Mysterious', 'Strangler', 'sub-plot', 'constant', 'mawkish', 'lampooning', 'art', 'world', 'denizens', 'otherwise', 'clever', 'engaging', 'indie', 'film', 'devolves', 'malicious', 'mean-spiritedness.After', 'art', 'certainly', 'murky', 'often', 'pretentious', 'subjectivism', 'occasionally', 'trite', 'standards', 'good', 'bad', 'ultimately', 'source', 'redemption', 'release', 'really', 'none', 'flick', 'sarcasm', 'increasingly', 'dark', 'stabs', 'humor', 'pathos', 'become', 'tangled', 'up', 'cheap', 'shots', 'half-starts', 'see', 'Platz', 'friendship', 'cynical', 'Bardo', 'end', 'result', 'something', 'interesting', 'also', 'shabby', 'clever', 'also', 'sullen', 'indie', 'world', 'idea', 'inside', 'joke.It', 'just', 'too', 'bad', 'forgot', 'punchline', 'DVD', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'short', 'clip', 'film-premiere', 'cast', 'discussing', 'making', 'movie', 'are', 'mildly', 'interesting', 'nothing', 'much', 'note']",N/A

He also can't get laid because, as he puts it, he has high standards. But he has a bigger problem. He wants to be an artist, indeed the greatest artist of the 21st Century. A fine ambition to be sure, but Jerome seems to be more in love with the idea of being an artist than creating art. And that's kind of a paradox, because he's the only person depicted in the film who creates pieces that are worth looking at. His style is somewhat akin to the doomed Jack Dawson from that slightly bigger film, Titanic, rather than that of his idol, Picasso.Jerome goes to a pretigious, northe eastern art school in hopes of picking up a few grains of wisdom that will help him to fullfill his ambition. The problem is that most of his fellow students and many of his teachers are either pretenders or insane or both. Then he runs into the age old problem of it's not what you know but who you know. Through in a beautiful artists model (the only female worth getting intiment with), a serial killer, and a fiendish plan to become the greatest artist of the 21st Century (or at least the current fashion of this season), and you got a delightfully, snarky little movie that makes the viewer laugh at everything and everyone in it with a mixture of contempt and astonishment.",5,A Snarky Little Film with Contempt for Pretension,1147478400,"05 13, 2006",2006,1400,"['Jerome', 'ackward', 'teenaged', 'charecter', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'film', 'getting', 'crap', 'various', 'bullies', 'also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'laid', 'because', 'high', 'standards', 'bigger', 'problem', 'be', 'artist', 'indeed', 'greatest', 'artist', '21st', 'Century', 'fine', 'ambition', 'be', 'sure', 'Jerome', 'be', 'more', 'love', 'idea', 'being', 'artist', 'creating', 'art', 'kind', 'paradox', 'only', 'person', 'depicted', 'film', 'who', 'pieces', 'are', 'worth', 'looking', 'style', 'somewhat', 'akin', 'doomed', 'Jack', 'Dawson', 'slightly', 'bigger', 'film', 'Titanic', 'rather', 'idol', 'Picasso.Jerome', 'pretigious', 'northe', 'eastern', 'art', 'school', 'hopes', 'picking', 'up', 'few', 'grains', 'wisdom', 'will', 'help', 'fullfill', 'ambition', 'problem', 'most', 'fellow', 'students', 'many', 'teachers', 'are', 'pretenders', 'insane', 'Then', 'age', 'old', 'problem', 'not', 'what', 'know', 'who', 'know', 'beautiful', 'artists', 'model', 'only', 'female', 'getting', 'intiment', 'serial', 'killer', 'fiendish', 'plan', 'become', 'greatest', 'artist', '21st', 'Century', 'least', 'current', 'fashion', 'season', 'got', 'delightfully', 'snarky', 'little', 'movie', 'viewer', 'laugh', 'everything', 'everyone', 'mixture', 'contempt', 'astonishment']",N/A

FUSCO ""yawnmower""","[1, 2]","Despite the strong cast (John Malkovich, Angelica Huston, and James Broadbent) and promising premise, this film fails by trying to be too many things at once: mindless T&A; comedy, cynical black comedy, coming-of-age, mystery, thriller, love story.Sensitive suburban high school artist Jerome (attractive, virginal Max Minghella), is bullied by cute jocks and draws portraits of girls he likes.  He escapes to an art school in New York City because he loves a model in its brochure, which goes a long way towards summing up his commitment to art and education.Jerome has two roommates: one is a gross, loud-mouthed film student; the other a fey fashion student, incredibly the only gay male in the school. There is a `militant lesbian' and, like her, every student is a one-dimensional stereotype. The cops searching for a campus strangler are brutal, foul-mouthed cretins.  Subtlety is not one of this film's virtues.Jerome meets Audrey, the girl in the brochure, and proceeds to bore everyone with his tireless obsession.  No one can blame her when she falls for Jonah, played by princely Matt Keeslar, an adonis whose simplistic art wins acclaim from one and all.  Audrey's young god is not who he appears to be and his story, not developed, would have been fascinating.  In an ironic twist, Jerome gains artistic success when he becomes associated with the strangler.There is a genuinely funny moment when Jerome's parents react to his talk of a girlfriend, and a sympathetic one when Jerome seeks advice from Angelica Huston. But there are way too many false notes.  Characters are not richly drawn, but simple monochromatic sketches. We are so clearly not in New York: the school is filmed on location in California so one minute we are on a sunny, spacious, modern campus, and the next we are on an impossibly dark, grim New York street set. The Beethoven Concerto used as a love theme throughout the film is uncredited.  Audrey is a model, but it is never established what else she does at the school besides being a foil for all the other girls (who are unbalanced, vindictive, and shrill), and an object for drooling, sophomoric males.  John Malkovich has some very funny postures and affectations, but is hobbled by the writing, as are all the actors.The title may be an homage to another silly film about students and cops. High School Confidential starred Russ Tamblyn as a sexy, wise-cracking flat-foot pretending to be in high school.  But the 1958 cult classic doesn't aspire to be more than it is: a superficial, cliched look at teenagers - plus it features Jerry Lee Lewis rockin' the school on the back of a flat-bed truck.",3,stick figures,1184112000,"07 11, 2007",2007,2642,"['strong', 'cast', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'Angelica', 'Huston', 'James', 'Broadbent', 'promising', 'premise', 'film', 'trying', 'be', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'once', 'mindless', 'T', 'A', 'comedy', 'cynical', 'black', 'comedy', 'coming-of-age', 'mystery', 'thriller', 'love', 'story.Sensitive', 'suburban', 'high', 'school', 'artist', 'Jerome', 'attractive', 'virginal', 'Max', 'Minghella', 'bullied', 'cute', 'jocks', 'draws', 'portraits', 'girls', 'art', 'school', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'model', 'brochure', 'long', 'way', 'towards', 'summing', 'up', 'commitment', 'art', 'education.Jerome', 'two', 'roommates', 'one', 'gross', 'loud-mouthed', 'film', 'student', 'other', 'fey', 'fashion', 'student', 'incredibly', 'only', 'gay', 'male', 'school', 'militant', 'lesbian', 'student', 'one-dimensional', 'stereotype', 'cops', 'searching', 'campus', 'strangler', 'are', 'brutal', 'foul-mouthed', 'cretins', 'Subtlety', 'not', 'one', 'film', 'virtues.Jerome', 'meets', 'Audrey', 'girl', 'brochure', 'proceeds', 'bore', 'everyone', 'tireless', 'obsession', 'one', 'can', 'blame', 'when', 'Jonah', 'played', 'princely', 'Matt', 'Keeslar', 'adonis', 'simplistic', 'art', 'acclaim', 'one', 'Audrey', 'young', 'god', 'not', 'who', 'be', 'story', 'not', 'developed', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fascinating', 'ironic', 'twist', 'Jerome', 'gains', 'artistic', 'success', 'when', 'associated', 'strangler.There', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'moment', 'when', 'Jerome', 'parents', 'react', 'talk', 'girlfriend', 'sympathetic', 'one', 'when', 'Jerome', 'advice', 'Angelica', 'Huston', 'are', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'false', 'notes', 'Characters', 'are', 'not', 'richly', 'drawn', 'simple', 'monochromatic', 'sketches', 'are', 'so', 'clearly', 'not', 'New', 'York', 'school', 'filmed', 'location', 'California', 'so', 'one', 'minute', 'are', 'sunny', 'spacious', 'modern', 'campus', 'next', 'are', 'impossibly', 'dark', 'grim', 'New', 'York', 'street', 'set', 'Beethoven', 'Concerto', 'used', 'love', 'theme', 'film', 'uncredited', 'Audrey', 'model', 'never', 'established', 'what', 'else', 'school', 'being', 'foil', 'other', 'girls', 'who', 'are', 'unbalanced', 'vindictive', 'shrill', 'object', 'drooling', 'sophomoric', 'males', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'very', 'funny', 'postures', 'affectations', 'hobbled', 'writing', 'are', 'actors.The', 'title', 'may', 'be', 'homage', 'silly', 'film', 'students', 'cops', 'High', 'School', 'Confidential', 'starred', 'Russ', 'Tamblyn', 'sexy', 'wise-cracking', 'flat-foot', 'pretending', 'be', 'high', 'school', '1958', 'cult', 'classic', ""n't"", 'aspire', 'be', 'more', 'superficial', 'cliched', 'look', 'teenagers', 'Jerry', 'Lee', 'Lewis', 'rockin', 'school', 'back', 'flat-bed', 'truck']",N/A

Terry Zwigoff is an assured cinematic stylist, Daniel Clowes knows how to write dialogue that makes you cringe with its horrible-hilarious accuracy, and there are some fascinating comic grotesques among the characters, particularly the weaselly painting professor and drunken art-school burnout played by John Malkovich and Jim Broadbent, respectively. But the film takes a major wrong turn about halfway through, and by the end has become truly vile. Jerome Platz (pouty-faced Max Minghella) is the putative hero, an idealistic, Candide-like freshman art student who finds himself reviled by teachers and classmates alike. None of them has a fraction of Jerome's natural talent, but all of them have, shall we say, the right attitude (i.e. they're all snotty, pretentious sycophants). Jerome pines for Audrey (Sophia Myles) a beautiful artist's model and daughter of a moderately successful artist, but she seems to have eyes only for Jonah (Matt Keeslar) a handsome man's man whose rudimentary drawing skills send the entire school into a worshipful tizzy. As long as the film stays centered on the silly, hothouse politics of art school, it's cogent and even laugh-out-loud funny. But a subplot about a campus strangler is introduced early on, and--without giving away the story--let's just say it ends up killing the film as well as a few minor characters. By the end, Zwigoff and Clowes have shown us triumphantly that all people (especially Jerome) are rotten to the core; that you can't win, break even or quit the game; and that since all you can do in this world is sell out, the best you can do is to sell out spectacularly. Swift, Voltaire, Twain and Waugh were merciless in their estimation of humankind, yet there were certain individuals they admired, and certain things they believed in. Zwigoff and Clowes have Jim Broadbent's character declare (echoed by Jerome), ""(Expletive deleted) the whole human race,"" and that appears to be the sum total of their philosophy.

1010558,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000H6SXSI,mirasreviews,"[0, 1]","""Art School Confidential"" is screenwriter Daniel Clowes satirical tribute to his art school days, when ignorance and oddity prevailed over any notions of aesthetic accomplishment. Jerome Platt (Max Minghella) has dreamed of being a great artist since childhood -or at least of being good enough to parlay his talent into acquiring a girlfriend. No such luck yet, but Jerome hopes to advance his social life and painting skills at Strathmore Institute, the local art school. The fact that the still-at-large ""Strathmore Strangler"" has murdered 3 people on campus recently seems inauspicious, but Jerome is determined to make the most of his opportunities. Unfortunately, the clueless students and fickle professors aren't what he hoped. Jerome's clumsy pursuit of an artists' model named Audrey (Sophia Myles) isn't going well. And the Strathmore Strangler keeps on killing.Viewers who attended art school at some point in their lives may find enough of the familiar in ""Art School Confidential"" to enjoy the film. It sends up talentless egomaniacal art professors who teach for the health insurance and desperately promote  their latest creations. It sends up the self-indulgent, pretentious students who insist on finding meaning in the art that least demonstrates any skill. And it sends up murder, so this is a black comedy. Director Terry Zwigoff does a good job of creating empathy for Jerome's frustration and his naivete. Where the film has problems is its genial tone that defies what we're seeing. The tone is never quite sharp enough, and the inclusion of romance dulls it further. John Malkovich makes an interesting contribution as the pompous Professor Sandiford, an artistic failure who doesn't let that stop him from dispensing capricious advice. ""Art School Confidential"" has some funny moments, but, unless it brings back some even funnier moments from your real life, I think you'll be underwhelmed.The DVD (Sony Pictures 2006): Bonus features include 12 deleted scenes, 1 additional montage scene (1 min), ""Bloopers and Alternate Takes"" (4 1/2 min), and 2 featurettes. ""Making of Art School Confidential"" (8 min) includes interviews with writer Daniel Clowes, who comments on his own art school experience, director Terry Zwigoff, and the cast speaking about the characters.

But on this trust I bought the movie, and I gotta say, I'm glad I did.  Overall, this is a pretty well made film.  It has a bit of everything for you, from humor, to love story, to satire and mystery, and follows a basic ""coming of age theme.""The movie is about Jacob, a young artist full of life and aspirations who has started his first year of art school.  Like any new college freshman, Jacob is filled with idealism and promise until he hits the hard truths that await him.  The school is a dump, his professors apathetic, his classmates boring tools.  Rather than finding an atmosphere where his talents will finally be appreciated, he finds his works constantly overlooked and degraded as typical and uncreative.  The situation is compounded when another student shows up the class with his childish renderings of tanks and cars, a new style of art which seems about to launch this student into stardom.This is the real problem in ""Art School Confidential.""  Instead of trying to achieve really good art, or even personal developement, everybody--profs included--seems to be focused on being the next great artist ready to take on the world.  Attracting the spotlight takes precedence over creating true art, which is blind-sided by snobbery, arrogance, lust, and ambition.  The film makes sure to fully exploit all of these qualities to their fullest in order to expose the stupidity of the situation and outright silliness of it's characters.Except for Jacob.  He alone seems really intent on wanting to be a great artist for the sake of being an artist.  The shock of the real artworld he finds which demands one be an experienced brown-noser rather than artist, slowly breaks him down and jades his outlook.  The only saving grace for Jacob is Audrey, an older student (?) whom captures his heart, but does not reciprocate this love.  While all of the characters in this movie are believable and absolutely great, it is Jacob that you really feel for.Behind the story of Jacob's coming af age, there is also a serial killer on the prowl, which adds an odd twist on the whole movie and an undertone of danger and impending disaster.  In fact, the whole mood of this movie, although upbeat on the surface, is rather bleak, but it works very well and is handled beautifully so that it is not too depressing.Personally, I thought the movie captured the essence of life.  Life is dissapointing and dirty.  It is filled with fraudulent characters and deceipt, and broken promises and dreams.  It is also filled with laughter and light.  The true artist will see the world for exactly what it is--ridiculous and irrational.  The real artist will find this balance, will embrace the filth while at the same time finding the humor in it all.Overall, I highly recomend this movie.  It very entertaining, and I think most people will at least get that out of it.  I know there are many people out there who were a little put off by the satirical presentation of the art world and its members, but please, don't take it so seriously.  It's a spoof.  In my own experiences, I have found these representations to apply not only to artist, but to any liberal arts studies.  Lets face it, there are a lot of people with their heads buried so far in their own intellectual self-importance that they have forgotten how to laugh.  Anyways, buy this movie and enjoy!",4,Well rounded movie.,1292889600,"12 21, 2010",2010,3497,"['was', 'turned', 'movie', 'someone', 'who', 'personal', 'reputation', 'truth', 'be', 'told', 'looked', 'little', 'silly', 'trust', 'bought', 'movie', 'got', 'ta', 'say', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'Overall', 'pretty', 'well', 'made', 'film', 'bit', 'everything', 'humor', 'love', 'story', 'satire', 'mystery', 'basic', 'coming', 'age', 'theme', 'movie', 'Jacob', 'young', 'artist', 'full', 'life', 'aspirations', 'who', 'started', 'first', 'year', 'art', 'school', 'new', 'college', 'freshman', 'Jacob', 'filled', 'idealism', 'promise', 'hard', 'truths', 'await', 'school', 'dump', 'professors', 'apathetic', 'classmates', 'boring', 'tools', 'Rather', 'finding', 'atmosphere', 'where', 'talents', 'will', 'finally', 'be', 'appreciated', 'works', 'constantly', 'overlooked', 'degraded', 'typical', 'uncreative', 'situation', 'compounded', 'when', 'student', 'up', 'class', 'childish', 'renderings', 'tanks', 'cars', 'new', 'style', 'art', 'launch', 'student', 'stardom.This', 'real', 'problem', 'Art', 'School', 'Confidential', 'Instead', 'trying', 'achieve', 'really', 'good', 'art', 'even', 'personal', 'developement', 'everybody', 'profs', 'included', 'be', 'focused', 'being', 'next', 'great', 'artist', 'ready', 'take', 'world', 'Attracting', 'spotlight', 'precedence', 'creating', 'true', 'art', 'blind-sided', 'snobbery', 'arrogance', 'lust', 'ambition', 'film', 'sure', 'fully', 'exploit', 'qualities', 'fullest', 'order', 'expose', 'stupidity', 'situation', 'outright', 'silliness', 'characters.Except', 'Jacob', 'alone', 'really', 'intent', 'wanting', 'be', 'great', 'artist', 'sake', 'being', 'artist', 'shock', 'real', 'artworld', 'one', 'be', 'experienced', 'brown-noser', 'rather', 'artist', 'slowly', 'down', 'jades', 'outlook', 'only', 'saving', 'grace', 'Jacob', 'Audrey', 'older', 'student', 'whom', 'heart', 'not', 'reciprocate', 'love', 'characters', 'movie', 'are', 'believable', 'absolutely', 'great', 'Jacob', 'really', 'feel', 'story', 'Jacob', 'coming', 'af', 'age', 'also', 'serial', 'killer', 'prowl', 'odd', 'twist', 'whole', 'movie', 'undertone', 'danger', 'impending', 'disaster', 'fact', 'whole', 'mood', 'movie', 'upbeat', 'surface', 'rather', 'bleak', 'very', 'well', 'handled', 'beautifully', 'so', 'not', 'too', 'depressing.Personally', 'thought', 'movie', 'captured', 'essence', 'life', 'Life', 'dissapointing', 'dirty', 'filled', 'fraudulent', 'characters', 'deceipt', 'broken', 'promises', 'dreams', 'also', 'filled', 'laughter', 'light', 'true', 'artist', 'will', 'see', 'world', 'exactly', 'what', 'ridiculous', 'irrational', 'real', 'artist', 'will', 'find', 'balance', 'will', 'embrace', 'filth', 'same', 'time', 'finding', 'humor', 'all.Overall', 'highly', 'recomend', 'movie', 'very', 'entertaining', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'least', 'get', 'know', 'are', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'little', 'put', 'off', 'satirical', 'presentation', 'art', 'world', 'members', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'so', 'seriously', 'spoof', 'own', 'experiences', 'have', 'found', 'representations', 'apply', 'not', 'only', 'artist', 'liberal', 'arts', 'studies', 'Lets', 'face', 'are', 'lot', 'people', 'heads', 'buried', 'so', 'far', 'own', 'intellectual', 'self-importance', 'have', 'forgotten', 'how', 'laugh', 'Anyways', 'buy', 'movie', 'enjoy']",N/A

""Art School Confidential"" demonstrates that sometimes the consequences of facing oneself are not pretty.... and that ugly direction and scattershot writing can further add to the mess.To understand this movie, it helps to know that Terry Zwigoff made the documentary ""Crumb"".  Only then does the combination of low-brow sarcasm and poor man's philosophizing begin to make sense.  Like Robert Crumb,  Zwigoff basically has contempt for everyone in the art world, and saves his greatest execration for the innocent.The ""innocent""  in this case is the protagonist of this exercise in misanthropy,  Jerome (played by Max Minghella).  Jerome is a starry-eyed kid who confuses art with the worship of ideals.  He flounces into art school like Little MIss Muffet, and finds his ideals cut off at every turn by boorish roommates,  burnt-out cases, neurotics, desperate losers, narcissists, Lesbians,  bulls--t artists, etc.  Does that have a familiar ring?  It could be because it's largely the same cast of characters that populates Robert Crumb cartoons.Jerome spirals into despair (also a Crumb theme) as he earns no praise from his professors,  gets criticized scathingly and unfairly by his classmates, and finally seems to be losing his one hope, the girl he worships, to a square-jawed idiot who has all the luck and none of the talent.Thus Jerome descends to the final circle of Hell, where he becomes capable of stealing others' work,  starting fires, and sealing his own fate.  Yes, this invokes ""Candide"", and Dante, and low-rent Dostoevsky,  but all for naught.  In the end you just have a flawed black comedy that has contempt for everything, and really no saving grace..because it isn't funny.  Paddy Chayefsky this ain't.  It totally wastes the talents of John Malkovich, Jim Broadbent,  Steve Buscemi, and Angelica Huston --who are all heavyweight actors--by giving them no room to do anything with their characters.  They're all trapped in a movie that wants badly to succeed both as a National Lampoon farce and as a soul-searing sermon about damnation.All you'll get from it is a bad headache, which Terry Zwigoff probably intended for you to get,  and which he probably believes that you heartily deserve.  If you want to watch a good black comedy about artistic pretentions,  I'd recommend Roger Corman's oldie,  ""A Bucket of Blood"".

1010566,A2K3UTNW0783U6,B000H6SXSI,Phillip Kay,"[3, 3]","I've just watched Art School Confidential, a 2006 film from Terry Zwigoff, maker of Crumb (1994) and Ghost World (2001), two of my favourite films. It gets wildly divergent responses from reviewers, usually a sign the film maker has hit his mark.Watch Crumb if you want to know what's wrong with America, dissected by an extraordinarily intelligent, very articulate and devastatingly vitriolic analyst who has worked through his own childhood abuse, art celebrity and exploitation and dysfunctional family life to achieve some kind of clarity. Robert Crumb is not just a talented artist and cartoonist but a master of black humour, whose comments are so accurate they make you feel uncomfortable even while you laugh.In Ghost World two best friends are in league against the mediocrity that surrounds them, the parents, the nerds, the pretentious advocates of bad taste. Then one of the friends succumbs (grows up). The film has a lot of heart and is much more than satire, but the tasteless, the sellout and the lies we tell ourselves are held up to ridicule until right at the end of the movie when Enid has an epiphany. She learns that if we believe enough, then our bus will arrive.Art School Confidential, made, like Ghost World, with Daniel Clowes (whose comics formed the basis for both films) attempts a more complex structure than the earlier films and is not entirely successful. Here the structural idea is to parody the teenage expos&eacute; film genre, as you can tell from the title, with all the stereotype characters and acts of violence, the rivalries and central love affair common to the genre. It's an easy target: even the best of the type, Rebel Without a Cause, now looks a bit dated.At the same time the pretensions of the art world are skewered (without doubt other professions, like financial analysis for example, have their pretensions. The film doesn't claim there is something unusual about art in this respect. And of course this is not a real art school). John Malkovich is devastatingly good as a teacher whose self obsession makes him less than useless as an instructor. Steve Buscemi has a few good minutes as Broadway Bob, an egotistical gallery owner. The students' critique of each other's work is a marvel of obfuscation. Everybody at this school works really hard on the trappings of art, without creating any art at all. The film really excels here, though the satire is a bit distant. The film makers are not as threatened by the art bureaucracy as Enid and Rebecca were of adulthood in Ghost World. And they can hardly lampoon artists ambitious of financial success while making a movie themselves, a business venture designed to make money.But there's more yet to the film. The central character, Jerome, wants to be as famous and admired as Picasso. He's shown as a good artist, but his emotional need is the motivation for what he does. He's at art school just as much to find the girl on the school catalog as to outpaint Picasso. While he dedicates himself to his painting he loses his girl and is sneered at by his fellow students. Once he joins the rat race and strives to impress, he gains ground, and when he exploits his notoriety as a suspected serial killer he not only starts to sell paintings, but his girl falls in love with him. He ends up with it all, but is separated from both girl and gallery by a visitors' glass wall in the prison where he awaits trial. So he doesn't get it all, merely the appearance of all. You'd be doing the film an injustice by seeing this as realism, though some surprisingly have done so.This is a serious attempt though to look at artists' motivations and the many ways you can sell out for success, with all the rewards and punishments this implies. And I wonder if the love affair, with beautiful music from a Beethoven concerto, was not self parody and a sellout as well. The acting was good enough to get me involved but I do have second thoughts. I did feel the love affair and the artistic ambitions illuminated one another.All told the film tries to do too much and feels as if some of its many producers might have tinkered with the script or tried to interfere with its development.

A Rubin,"[0, 0]","On the one hand I commend a little pricking of the Elitist Art Bubble, but on the other, sigh, there really is something called art that can thrill the appreciator.  The problem is: what is bad, good, great, or fantastically great art?  Do we know it when we see it?  Everyone can understand great technique, particularly in representational realism.  Rembrandt or a Winged Victory are made recognizable, thereby letting in the rabble on the experience.  But Modern Art, there's the elitists to guide.  In other words, only the elitists can bestow greatness on scribbles or Piss Christ's.  That's a problem.  Who made these people experts?  Hmmm, Art Schools?Max Minghella has talent in as much as his drawings are representational and competent, but he runs up against fellow students and teachers that do not value technical skill as much as they value bizarre concepts and intellectual mumbo jumbo. Max as Jerome strives to be a great artist like Picasso, but is disappointed that his teachers and wack-job fellow artists think Picasso an ugly little man without artistic merit. So it turns out that Art School does not teach artists to be great, but instead warehouse the losers of high school to be taught by the losers of Art School.  I am paraphrasing, as an alumni of Art School says, ""if you want to be a great artist, school will not do.  You have to be a great artist.As many in the arts, Jerome wants to be a great artist to make it with the girls.  Unfortunately, the girls of Art School are psycho, but he does fall for the nude model, Sophia Myles. Sophia is pretty, but I must say, she appears to be a few years older than Jerome, making it difficult to believe she would have any interest in him.  Of course, she's on board after an arrest in a plot device that keeps the film on course.  There is a funny strangler on campus.Look, the film is a satire with a few laughs.  It is not as good by a mile as Terry Zwighoff's Ghost World.  That was quirky too, but the June-August romance seemed real somehow, and weirdly profound.  Art School is about Holden Caulfield's phonies fifty years later.

I would say that this is an interesting meditation on art, what art is, what is takes to be an artist and how the world around us perceives the art.

A cutthroat, mean-spirited place for burn-outs and misfits deluded with imaginary talent?"", the answer is a resounding ""No"".  In fact, one is far more likely to find a vacuous, materialistic, lock-step student body at a business school or law school than they would ever find at art school, a place where the best instructors pass on their skills and passions and a love of art to an open-minded, courageous group of creative individuals.  As long as this is understood, and one watches this film with the realization that it is caricature, ""Art School Confidential"" is a well-made and very funny movie.Admittedly, it took me a 2nd and eventually 3rd viewing to get past the overriding sense of ""meanness"" in this film.  Daniel Clowes' screenplay often has a vindictive tone, its humor sometimes becoming cruel and angry.  I can't help but wonder how much better this movie could have been if it had depicted art students (and teachers) as lovable eccentrics rather than hopeless losers.  But over time I have learned to like, and even love, this film as a golfer might love ""Caddyshack"" or a cubicle worker might love ""Office Space"".The best scenes are those with the always-wonderful John Malkovich as the rejected triangle painter, Joel David Moore as the jaded, half-interested commentator of all the stupidity he sees around him, Ethan Suplee as the disheveled but ambitious would-be horror movie director, and Sophia Myles, who brings a touch of beauty and sweetness to a film utterly lacking in either.""Art School Confidential"" won't be everyone's cup of tea but it strings together some wonderfully hilarious scenes that somehow all add up to a satisfying, if somewhat depressing, conclusion.

1010572,AB6R78MEM3M6O,B000H6SXSI,Shortall,"[3, 3]","Though I don't want to go into great detail on the plotlines, as it's all been said very well already, I do want to say that I most agree with 'Thornhill's' review in that this is a movie, that while having some very funny 'bits' throughout (particularly to those familiar with certain parts of the art world) never really seems to ever 'gel' together into a truly working film. Perhaps it's because unlike Ghostworld, which had a variety of characters, which though wacky, we could grow to relate to and love in several ways as they went about their lives..  most of the people that inhabit the world of ASC are merely shallow 'cardboard cutouts' that never develop. We never come to care about any of them - including the brooding, attention-seeking wanna-be artist protagonist. It's a shame really, as the initial idea seems like a really great one, and the parts from Ghostworld that hinted at much of the ridiculousness of 'art schools/wacky teachers' were among my favorites.. But despite the great (& here very poorly used) cast - It just doesn't ever come together. Even though Zwigoff and Clowes may have been attempting to make a point with the whole (ridiculous) 'Strathemore Strangler' idea, the end result is that it simply comes off as their not TRUSTING or having developed their best ideas enough. Had that dropped all that 'B-movie' crap, and more fully developed the characters and ideas involving the school & it's various students/teachers itself... they may have made a great little movie. Instead of yet another 'bad/fair movie with a few good bits here & there'.A few little points of interest to me while watching this:  -Despite what previous reviewers have mentioned about Jerome's supposed 'high-goals' or talents, ..To me Jerome isn't much interested in art, art-making, or the business of art.. as he is on recieving immediate approval & attention from everyone around him (that's his problem really - not to mention alot of people in real life ;O) When he visits the home of his teacher, sees the ridiculous triangles hanging on the walls, and overhears firsthand how BADLY the teacher is at his very own business - anyone with any sense would have walked out realizing the guy was a complete hack. But of course Jerome doesn't seem to realize this.(If he did - we wouldn't have any movie) But instead asks the teacher for his advice... and later when he actually tries following it, gets scorned by this same milkdud for having done so. At least Enid (Ghostworld) knew when the people around her were 'full of it'.- Picasso was very likely chosen as Jerome's hero for audience name recognition (plus it doesn't hurt that he had numerous well-known affairs - Which I may add, isn't too unlike many men.. only that Picasso's were more 'publicized' being who he was..) But strangely Jerome seems to have never SEEN nor been influenced by anything of Picasso's, as what he does bears neither an inkling resemblance to either Picasso's more academic periods or any of the various forms of cubism. More akin (thanks to Clowes talents likely) to comic-book illustration. I'm not knocking the style at all, as I've done it myself for many years, but it's NOT really what you'd expect a student in an actual life-drawing class to be doing. Had the better of my own two college drawing teachers  been there, she would have swatted him and told him to work on his 'lights, darks, & forms' and 'stop drawing all those damn charicatures'. ;)- Strangely, the scene where Sophia Myles gets up to get a cigarette (alas, her 'glorious buns' have more personality than the rest of her in this movie) You'll notice a girl sitting next to Jerome that seems to have the very same style & abilities as Jerome.. as her pic is almost the very same(though emphasizing the head more) but this is never brought up of course.- Stranger still, in the same scene.. all the students seem to think that they're in a 'Portrait class' & not a lifedrawing one - as they have all pretty much ignored Sophia's lovely form, and have depicted her soley from the waist or chest up.  Not a big deal at all, but I found it a tad amusing.- Though it was probably overshadowed by the reactions of the parents (also funny) ..I did love the bit where the grandmotherly-type told Jerome about some silly little girl that paints little animals on shoes and supposedly sells them... and that 'maybe he should try something like that too!' (LOL)  Even now that I sell my own art & make a decent living at it(Hmm, does that make me one of the 'elite special '1 in 100'?.. Do I get a cookie for it? ;O)  I'll still occasionally hear something just like that (it's USUALLY a late-middle to elderly woman that says it too) To actually see this very same thing in a movie was hilarious. Like I said - The movie isn't great... but it does has some funny 'bits' to those that have been through it. ;)The movie does do one thing fairly well though... showing that a good majority of what goes on in so-called 'art schools' is really rather ridiculous & pointless. And that the words spoken by the 'a-h@le artist that made it' though possibly meant as a bit of a snide joke.. are actually the most profound in the movie.If one were to go to his/her local library, rent a bunch of videos and read-up on a good number of books (including a few on art business while you're at it) ..you would have (assuming you have the natural skills to back it up) a FAR GREATER knowledge and technical expertise than anything the majority of these schools could give you.

1010574,A3PKTO0UJJJ8BS,B000H6SXSI,"Sunny California ""JR""","[0, 2]","I'm both a fan of Clowes and Zwigoff. This movie started off well, hilarious in fact. It depicted art classes fairly well. However, the stereotyping and forced script seemed totally off after a while. Clowes is a great artist and writer but to stretch his stories out over hours doesn't quite work. ""Ghost World"" had the same type of issue...the story just got stretched too thin and there were too many plotlines -works great in the comics, but not in a movie IMO. The actors are excellent, and the characters are hilarious. My favorite was the disgruntled Asian art teacher. Clowes depicts women (particularly female artists) in a bad light -they're either psychotic (somehow psychologically damaged) or unattainable -I am an artist and know/have known many female artists in life and none of them act like the women in this movie -misogyny much? There are few with redeeming qualities that make the characters stand out as individuals. It seems like he always has to put a label on everyone, which is kind of what this movie is going against...having such a hatred for people and society (misanthropy) must be so tiring to be around. What a drag.The main character is talented in the classical sense, and he finds constant aggravation in the praise lavished upon his classmates for their ""amateurish"" offerings. In the end, he becomes the ultimate sellout to achieve his dream of ""being the most famous artist of the 21st Century"". It's this act of self-gratification that brings the character down -the entitlement that the protagonist (Jerome) feels is ultimately his killed any empathy I had for him. Yeah, it's just a movie, but when you're rooting for the little guy, and he steals someone else's art for his own gain while the other artist is a mentally disturbed alcoholic, living in a rent-controlled dump, need I say more.And there was Picasso references abound, as in ""Picasso was an unoriginal sellout"" type of thing going on. Anyone who's studied the ""Father of Modern Art"" Picasso or has actually seen a Picasso (me) knows otherwise -I found that extremely irritating.I used to go to ComiCon in San Diego every year and met Clowes, who signed one of my comics. He's kind of a scary guy to be around because I felt like he was really studying people for characters. If I ever found anything out, it's not to piss of an artist or a writer. Anyhow, I feel Clowes' anti-society statement here more than ever and it's tiresome. The cliches just drowned this film and I just found myself tuning out and not caring anymore. The ending is kind of a cop-out too, just too literal and feels totally fake.",2,"Clever and interesting at first, but ultimately pretentious drivel",1352419200,"11 9, 2012",2012,2610,"[""'m"", 'fan', 'Clowes', 'Zwigoff', 'movie', 'started', 'off', 'well', 'hilarious', 'fact', 'depicted', 'art', 'classes', 'fairly', 'well', 'However', 'stereotyping', 'forced', 'script', 'seemed', 'totally', 'off', 'while', 'Clowes', 'great', 'artist', 'writer', 'stretch', 'stories', 'out', 'hours', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'Ghost', 'World', 'had', 'same', 'type', 'issue', 'story', 'just', 'got', 'stretched', 'too', 'thin', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'plotlines', '-works', 'great', 'comics', 'not', 'movie', 'IMO', 'actors', 'are', 'excellent', 'characters', 'are', 'hilarious', 'favorite', 'was', 'disgruntled', 'Asian', 'art', 'teacher', 'Clowes', 'women', 'particularly', 'female', 'artists', 'bad', 'light', '-they', ""'re"", 'psychotic', 'somehow', 'psychologically', 'damaged', 'unattainable', '-I', 'am', 'artist', 'know/have', 'known', 'many', 'female', 'artists', 'life', 'none', 'act', 'women', 'movie', 'much', 'are', 'few', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'make', 'characters', 'stand', 'out', 'individuals', 'always', 'put', 'label', 'everyone', 'kind', 'what', 'movie', 'going', 'having', 'such', 'hatred', 'people', 'society', 'misanthropy', 'must', 'be', 'so', 'tiring', 'be', 'around', 'What', 'drag.The', 'main', 'character', 'talented', 'classical', 'sense', 'constant', 'aggravation', 'praise', 'lavished', 'classmates', 'amateurish', 'offerings', 'end', 'ultimate', 'sellout', 'achieve', 'dream', 'being', 'most', 'famous', 'artist', '21st', 'Century', 'act', 'self-gratification', 'character', 'down', '-the', 'entitlement', 'protagonist', 'Jerome', 'feels', 'ultimately', 'killed', 'empathy', 'had', 'Yeah', 'just', 'movie', 'when', ""'re"", 'rooting', 'little', 'guy', 'someone', 'else', 'art', 'own', 'gain', 'other', 'artist', 'mentally', 'disturbed', 'alcoholic', 'living', 'rent-controlled', 'dump', 'need', 'say', 'more.And', 'there', 'was', 'Picasso', 'references', 'abound', 'Picasso', 'was', 'unoriginal', 'sellout', 'type', 'thing', 'going', 'Anyone', 'who', 'studied', 'Father', 'Modern', 'Art', 'Picasso', 'actually', 'seen', 'Picasso', 'otherwise', '-I', 'found', 'extremely', 'irritating.I', 'used', 'go', 'ComiCon', 'San', 'Diego', 'year', 'met', 'Clowes', 'who', 'signed', 'one', 'comics', 'kind', 'scary', 'guy', 'be', 'felt', 'was', 'really', 'studying', 'people', 'characters', 'ever', 'found', 'anything', 'out', 'not', 'piss', 'artist', 'writer', 'Anyhow', 'feel', 'Clowes', 'anti-society', 'statement', 'here', 'more', 'ever', 'tiresome', 'cliches', 'just', 'drowned', 'film', 'just', 'found', 'tuning', 'out', 'not', 'caring', 'anymore', 'ending', 'kind', 'cop-out', 'too', 'just', 'too', 'literal', 'feels', 'totally', 'fake']",N/A
1010575,A25MKVVHG6LL52,B000H6SXSI,TexFX,"[2, 8]","Any creative person who rates ""Art School Confidential"" highly must be full of self-loathing. As an artist myself, this so-called movie really pisses me off. The stereotypical theme, pounded in with sledge-hammer subtlety, says that Art=BS and an unquenchable lust for celebrity is the only motivating factor in creative life. That's hardly a novel idea but this bash fest goes a step further, operating on the premise that there's no such thing as creativity and those who believe there is simply don't know how to play the scam. This scornful, mean-spirited approach is like some FoxNews view of modern art, as a hermetically sealed ouch-cube populated by galloping, self-involved egomaniacs. I won't deny there's pretense in the art world, but I draw the line when a film claims that's all there is. This may even be the standard view of a lotta folks, but it's a corny, mediocre idea to base a movie on and it certainly doesn't tell the whole story.Even more boring is that every last inmate in this asylum is a standard issue nut job. Maybe I went to a better art school, but where are the INTERESTING weirdos? The guy who only paints steam trains and in his madness can get you fascinated by them, too. Where are the amazing women? A special kind of girl is driven by art - many have tremendous charm and the sheer esthetic bravado to try anything once, in art or life. Basically my question for this movie is: Where's Art School? Where are the rousing friendships, the bonhomie, the crazy parties, the all-night confabs, the hard work and insane joys and desperate failures that come with the creative process?In this flick EVERYTHING is a sham. Talent is another word for charlatanism and inspiration equals self-delusion, or at best, cynical manipulation. Some of my art teachers were among the funniest, most perceptive people I ever met, but here a teacher is the poor fool who actually buys the con, who believes art can have intrinsic value, magic, beauty or power - in effect, the biggest sucker of all.It's such a pedestrian take you have to wonder why a director who feels that way would bother making a movie about art school in the first place - revenge maybe? Like the kid who got picked on in high school? And you gotta wonder how this dreck got indie street-cred when it was released - because it allegedly deals with a new area in film? But don't think the subject has now been explored. This is strictly art from the outside looking in - and it seems like the one looking in is a resentful hillbilly. The screenplay doesn't even attempt to capture the flavor of art school... that would take actual talent, or experience, or at least effort, and this flick is way too cynical for that. It takes the easy out at every opportunity, turning what might have been an interesting subject into a cliched, predictable mash. It does have Malkovich and though he's utterly wasted, that's the reason it gets one star from me.",1,A FoxNews view of the art world...,1376784000,"08 18, 2013",2013,2937,"['creative', 'person', 'who', 'rates', 'Art', 'School', 'Confidential', 'highly', 'must', 'be', 'full', 'self-loathing', 'artist', 'so-called', 'movie', 'really', 'off', 'stereotypical', 'theme', 'pounded', 'sledge-hammer', 'subtlety', 'Art=BS', 'unquenchable', 'lust', 'celebrity', 'only', 'motivating', 'factor', 'creative', 'life', 'hardly', 'novel', 'idea', 'bash', 'fest', 'step', 'further', 'operating', 'premise', 'such', 'thing', 'creativity', 'who', 'believe', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'play', 'scam', 'scornful', 'mean-spirited', 'approach', 'FoxNews', 'view', 'modern', 'art', 'hermetically', 'sealed', 'ouch-cube', 'populated', 'galloping', 'self-involved', 'egomaniacs', 'wo', ""n't"", 'deny', 'pretense', 'art', 'world', 'draw', 'line', 'when', 'film', 'may', 'even', 'be', 'standard', 'view', 'lotta', 'folks', 'corny', 'mediocre', 'idea', 'base', 'movie', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'tell', 'whole', 'story.Even', 'more', 'boring', 'last', 'inmate', 'asylum', 'standard', 'issue', 'nut', 'job', 'Maybe', 'went', 'better', 'art', 'school', 'where', 'are', 'INTERESTING', 'weirdos', 'guy', 'who', 'only', 'steam', 'trains', 'madness', 'can', 'get', 'fascinated', 'too', 'Where', 'are', 'amazing', 'women', 'special', 'kind', 'girl', 'driven', 'art', 'many', 'have', 'tremendous', 'charm', 'sheer', 'esthetic', 'bravado', 'try', 'anything', 'once', 'art', 'life', 'Basically', 'question', 'movie', 'Where', 'Art', 'School', 'Where', 'are', 'rousing', 'friendships', 'bonhomie', 'crazy', 'parties', 'all-night', 'confabs', 'hard', 'work', 'insane', 'joys', 'desperate', 'failures', 'come', 'creative', 'process', 'flick', 'EVERYTHING', 'sham', 'Talent', 'word', 'charlatanism', 'inspiration', 'equals', 'self-delusion', 'best', 'cynical', 'manipulation', 'art', 'teachers', 'were', 'funniest', 'most', 'perceptive', 'people', 'ever', 'met', 'here', 'teacher', 'poor', 'fool', 'who', 'actually', 'con', 'who', 'art', 'can', 'have', 'intrinsic', 'value', 'magic', 'beauty', 'power', 'effect', 'biggest', 'sucker', 'all.It', 'such', 'pedestrian', 'take', 'have', 'wonder', 'why', 'director', 'who', 'way', 'would', 'bother', 'making', 'movie', 'art', 'school', 'first', 'place', 'revenge', 'maybe', 'kid', 'who', 'got', 'picked', 'high', 'school', 'got', 'ta', 'wonder', 'how', 'dreck', 'got', 'indie', 'street-cred', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'allegedly', 'new', 'area', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'subject', 'now', 'been', 'explored', 'strictly', 'art', 'outside', 'looking', 'one', 'looking', 'resentful', 'hillbilly', 'screenplay', ""n't"", 'even', 'attempt', 'capture', 'flavor', 'art', 'school', 'would', 'take', 'actual', 'talent', 'experience', 'least', 'effort', 'flick', 'way', 'too', 'cynical', 'easy', 'out', 'opportunity', 'turning', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'subject', 'cliched', 'predictable', 'mash', 'have', 'Malkovich', 'utterly', 'wasted', 'reason', 'one', 'star']",N/A
1010576,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000H6SXSI,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[6, 9]","Jerome (Max Minghella) has always grown up with dreams of becoming the greatest artist of the 21st Century. As college approaches, his only choice is Strathmore College. Finally able to express his artistic views, Jerome is overjoyed to have this opportunity but soon becomes perplexed by Professor Sandiford (John Malkovich), who seems to encourage the most mundane works. His friend, Jonah (Matt Keeslar) introduces him to Jimmy (Jim Broadbent), an alcoholic artist and a former student of Strathmore. And Jerome pursues his dream girl, Audrey (Sophia Myles), the daughter of a famous student and a model for many of the classes. While Jerome finds his footing at the art school, the Strathmore Strangler claims two more victims.""Art School Confidential"", written by and based on the graphic novel by Daniel Clowes and directed by Terry Zwigoff, both of whom worked on the classic ""Ghost World"", is a disappointing film.What the film gets right is the whole culture of Art School. The school is under funded and located in the worst part of town, yet students flock to receive any little bit of wisdom to get their career started. It captures many moments of going to an art school, from the pompous student who asks questions to make him seem more intelligent to the professors who are as desperate for recognition as their students. During Jerome's first day in class, Jonah points out all of the other stereotypes in the school; the angry lesbian, the film student, the emotional girl, the hippie, you get the idea.The problem is that the film doesn't go beyond these stereotypes. Yes, it's amusing to point them out, to acknowledge their existence, but the joke doesn't go any further, do anything new, and falls short. Once the stereotypes are acknowledged, the next step is to take them to another level. That doesn't happen. What happens when a joke falls short? It becomes tedious and boring.Max Minghella is good as Jerome, the virginal art student who is bombarded with new experiences. There seems to be a slow burn under the surface as he has more and more new things thrown at him. But the role is not defined clearly enough. For instance, when Jerome states his favorite artist is Picasso, another person makes fun of him. Yet, later at a costume party, he dresses as Picasso. Is this a joke or how he actually feels?The relationship between Jerome and Audrey is interesting, more so because of Jerome's virginal angst. Sophia Myles is boring in this role. Throughout, she plays everything very even keel and nothing really seems to change her attitude towards anything. During an early date, she uses Jerome as an excuse to get out spending time with her famous father, but this doesn't go anywhere. Later, as their relationship becomes more complicated, she doesn't seem to realize and she starts dating someone else. But why? Clearly, Jerome is attracted to her physical attributes, but she doesn't appear to have any personality.Watching ""Confidential"", I chuckled occasionally as Zwigoff and Clowes threw out an occasional curve ball observation, but as the jokes began to wear thin, I kept hoping for another level, another idea, something to sustain the black humor. As I realized the film wasn't going to work, I tried to pinpoint why and I couldn't quite figure it out. Yes, the jokes are easy and one note. Yes, the performances are artificially broad in some cases, but these elements should work together and provide some fun. But they don't mesh. What is the problem here? The combination of these elements, an okay lead, a boring lead actress and established actors who do nothing with their roles seems to have created a mess.Throughout the film, there is another element detracting from what should be a good black comedy. The Strathmore Strangler is a pervasive element in the film. We almost know more about this character before we know anything about Jerome. The moment Jerome arrives in his dorm and he meets one of his roommates Vince (Ethan Suplee, TVs ""My Name is Earl""), an aspiring film student who wants to make a mockumentary about the Strangler, Vince gives him a quick rundown of the murders. Throughout, people keep referring to the villain. Yet, the constant mentions seem sort of out of place. They are just that, mentions and they don't seem to concern the main characters all that much. Of course, as the film nears its finale, the killer becomes a little more predominant. But the element is an unnecessary distraction. Because the idea isn't developed enough, the filmmakers would have been better off to remove it and concentrate on the comedic elements.The one interesting visual moment in the film involves a depiction of one of the Strangler's murders. But does that even have a place in a black comedy about art school?""Confidential"" has the germ of a good film, but the filmmakers don't follow through on it.",2,"Instead of Great Art, the Equivalent of one of those Matchbook Art Exams",1147305600,"05 11, 2006",2006,4867,"['Jerome', 'Max', 'Minghella', 'always', 'grown', 'up', 'dreams', 'becoming', 'greatest', 'artist', '21st', 'Century', 'college', 'approaches', 'only', 'choice', 'Strathmore', 'College', 'Finally', 'able', 'express', 'artistic', 'views', 'Jerome', 'overjoyed', 'have', 'opportunity', 'soon', 'becomes', 'perplexed', 'Professor', 'Sandiford', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'who', 'encourage', 'most', 'mundane', 'works', 'friend', 'Jonah', 'Matt', 'Keeslar', 'Jimmy', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'alcoholic', 'artist', 'former', 'student', 'Strathmore', 'Jerome', 'dream', 'girl', 'Audrey', 'Sophia', 'Myles', 'daughter', 'famous', 'student', 'model', 'many', 'classes', 'Jerome', 'footing', 'art', 'school', 'Strathmore', 'Strangler', 'two', 'more', 'victims', 'Art', 'School', 'Confidential', 'written', 'based', 'graphic', 'novel', 'Daniel', 'Clowes', 'directed', 'Terry', 'Zwigoff', 'whom', 'worked', 'classic', 'Ghost', 'World', 'disappointing', 'film.What', 'film', 'right', 'whole', 'culture', 'Art', 'School', 'school', 'funded', 'located', 'worst', 'part', 'town', 'students', 'flock', 'receive', 'little', 'bit', 'wisdom', 'get', 'career', 'started', 'many', 'moments', 'going', 'art', 'school', 'pompous', 'student', 'who', 'questions', 'make', 'seem', 'more', 'intelligent', 'professors', 'who', 'are', 'desperate', 'recognition', 'students', 'Jerome', 'first', 'day', 'class', 'Jonah', 'out', 'other', 'stereotypes', 'school', 'angry', 'lesbian', 'film', 'student', 'emotional', 'girl', 'hippie', 'get', 'idea.The', 'problem', 'film', ""n't"", 'go', 'stereotypes', 'Yes', 'amusing', 'point', 'out', 'acknowledge', 'existence', 'joke', ""n't"", 'go', 'further', 'do', 'anything', 'new', 'short', 'stereotypes', 'are', 'acknowledged', 'next', 'step', 'take', 'level', ""n't"", 'happen', 'What', 'when', 'joke', 'short', 'tedious', 'boring.Max', 'Minghella', 'good', 'Jerome', 'virginal', 'art', 'student', 'who', 'bombarded', 'new', 'experiences', 'be', 'slow', 'burn', 'surface', 'more', 'more', 'new', 'things', 'thrown', 'role', 'not', 'defined', 'clearly', 'enough', 'instance', 'when', 'Jerome', 'favorite', 'artist', 'Picasso', 'person', 'fun', 'later', 'costume', 'party', 'Picasso', 'joke', 'how', 'actually', 'feels', 'relationship', 'Jerome', 'Audrey', 'interesting', 'more', 'so', 'Jerome', 'virginal', 'angst', 'Sophia', 'Myles', 'boring', 'role', 'Throughout', 'everything', 'very', 'even', 'keel', 'nothing', 'really', 'change', 'attitude', 'anything', 'early', 'date', 'Jerome', 'excuse', 'get', 'out', 'spending', 'time', 'famous', 'father', ""n't"", 'go', 'anywhere', 'Later', 'relationship', 'more', 'complicated', ""n't"", 'seem', 'realize', 'dating', 'someone', 'else', 'why', 'Clearly', 'Jerome', 'attracted', 'physical', 'attributes', ""n't"", 'appear', 'have', 'personality.Watching', 'Confidential', 'chuckled', 'occasionally', 'Zwigoff', 'Clowes', 'threw', 'out', 'occasional', 'curve', 'observation', 'jokes', 'began', 'wear', 'thin', 'kept', 'hoping', 'level', 'idea', 'something', 'sustain', 'black', 'humor', 'realized', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'work', 'tried', 'pinpoint', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'quite', 'figure', 'out', 'Yes', 'jokes', 'are', 'easy', 'one', 'note', 'Yes', 'performances', 'are', 'artificially', 'broad', 'cases', 'elements', 'should', 'work', 'together', 'provide', 'fun', 'do', ""n't"", 'mesh', 'What', 'problem', 'here', 'combination', 'elements', 'okay', 'lead', 'boring', 'lead', 'actress', 'established', 'actors', 'who', 'do', 'nothing', 'roles', 'have', 'created', 'mess.Throughout', 'film', 'element', 'detracting', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'good', 'black', 'comedy', 'Strathmore', 'Strangler', 'pervasive', 'element', 'film', 'almost', 'know', 'more', 'character', 'know', 'anything', 'Jerome', 'moment', 'Jerome', 'dorm', 'one', 'roommates', 'Vince', 'Ethan', 'Suplee', 'TVs', 'Name', 'Earl', 'aspiring', 'film', 'student', 'who', 'make', 'mockumentary', 'Strangler', 'Vince', 'quick', 'rundown', 'murders', 'Throughout', 'people', 'keep', 'referring', 'villain', 'constant', 'mentions', 'seem', 'sort', 'place', 'are', 'just', 'mentions', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'concern', 'main', 'characters', 'that', 'much', 'course', 'film', 'finale', 'killer', 'little', 'more', 'predominant', 'element', 'unnecessary', 'distraction', 'idea', ""n't"", 'developed', 'enough', 'filmmakers', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'remove', 'concentrate', 'comedic', 'elements.The', 'one', 'interesting', 'visual', 'moment', 'film', 'depiction', 'one', 'Strangler', 'murders', 'even', 'have', 'place', 'black', 'comedy', 'art', 'school', 'Confidential', 'germ', 'good', 'film', 'filmmakers', 'do', ""n't"", 'follow']",N/A
1010577,A2GJ98824GGXGP,B000H6SXSI,Timothy Kearney,"[0, 1]","While everyone else is seeing what all the fuss surrounding THE DA VINCI CODE is all about, I decided to see a film that had previews that seemed too good to resist: ART SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL. It tells a simple story. Jerome (Max Minghella) is an affable freshman attending an art school The Swarthmore Institute. It is filled with all the caricatures of art students that could possibly be found from students to faculty. Jerome has two goals in mind: becoming a famous artist and pursuing the girls of his dreams, Audrey (played by Sophia Myles) the drawing class model. He decides she'll be his muse. The humor of the film stems Jerome's having a clue about what art is all about set against some rather boorish artsy types and a chain of improbable twists that brings this at times dark comedy to an ironic end.This film has a number of things that make it work. It is well written and the humor is subtle, always avoiding the cheap laugh. The actors are believable in their roles, especially John Malcovich as Professor Sandiford, the once promising but now stuck in academia artist. Angelica Huston plays a small role as an art history instructor who comes across as an art sophisticate that probably ahs a limited knowledge of art.  Max Minghella is believable as Jerome and Joel Moore is perfect as his sidekick Bardo, the frequent college dropout who explains art school life to Jerome. The actors who play the smaller parts of the people who populate the Swarthmore Institute are hilarious and make the film a fun evening's entertainment.When the film was over and I was exiting the theatre, I saw many people who could have been the inspiration of the actors who played the art school students. Since I saw the film in Cambridge, MA, I'm assuming that they could be students from Massachusetts College of Art or the Museum of Fine Arts Museum School. I heard a few comparing what they saw on screen to their fellow students, which means it may be just like a typical art school, but everyone, art student or not, seemed to laugh out loud during the film.Enjoy!",4,An Art School Like No Other,1148428800,"05 24, 2006",2006,2069,"['everyone', 'else', 'seeing', 'what', 'fuss', 'surrounding', 'THE', 'DA', 'VINCI', 'CODE', 'decided', 'see', 'film', 'had', 'previews', 'seemed', 'too', 'good', 'resist', 'ART', 'SCHOOL', 'CONFIDENTIAL', 'simple', 'story', 'Jerome', 'Max', 'Minghella', 'affable', 'freshman', 'attending', 'art', 'school', 'Swarthmore', 'Institute', 'filled', 'caricatures', 'art', 'students', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'found', 'students', 'faculty', 'Jerome', 'two', 'goals', 'mind', 'becoming', 'famous', 'artist', 'pursuing', 'girls', 'dreams', 'Audrey', 'played', 'Sophia', 'Myles', 'drawing', 'class', 'model', ""'ll"", 'be', 'muse', 'humor', 'film', 'Jerome', 'having', 'clue', 'what', 'art', 'set', 'rather', 'boorish', 'artsy', 'types', 'chain', 'improbable', 'twists', 'times', 'dark', 'comedy', 'ironic', 'end.This', 'film', 'number', 'things', 'make', 'work', 'well', 'written', 'humor', 'subtle', 'always', 'avoiding', 'cheap', 'laugh', 'actors', 'are', 'believable', 'roles', 'especially', 'John', 'Malcovich', 'Professor', 'Sandiford', 'once', 'promising', 'now', 'academia', 'artist', 'Angelica', 'Huston', 'small', 'role', 'art', 'history', 'instructor', 'who', 'across', 'art', 'sophisticate', 'probably', 'limited', 'knowledge', 'art', 'Max', 'Minghella', 'believable', 'Jerome', 'Joel', 'Moore', 'perfect', 'sidekick', 'Bardo', 'frequent', 'college', 'dropout', 'who', 'art', 'school', 'life', 'Jerome', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'smaller', 'parts', 'people', 'who', 'populate', 'Swarthmore', 'Institute', 'are', 'hilarious', 'make', 'film', 'fun', 'evening', 'entertainment.When', 'film', 'was', 'was', 'exiting', 'theatre', 'saw', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'inspiration', 'actors', 'who', 'played', 'art', 'school', 'students', 'saw', 'film', 'Cambridge', 'MA', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'could', 'be', 'students', 'Massachusetts', 'College', 'Art', 'Museum', 'Fine', 'Arts', 'Museum', 'School', 'heard', 'few', 'comparing', 'what', 'saw', 'screen', 'fellow', 'students', 'may', 'be', 'just', 'typical', 'art', 'school', 'everyone', 'art', 'student', 'not', 'seemed', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'film.Enjoy']",N/A

He is responsible for the documentary of Robert Crumb entitled `Crumb', which was one of the better films made in the last two decades.  `Bad Santa' was a very big surprise as well, so I am caught scratching my head as to why he decided this particular script and/or subject matter was worth making a feature presentation over.For starters, people who are serious artists and who over-emphasize the importance of their craft are the most annoying people on the planet.  I can say that because I went through a department with this type of person.  They are self indulged and think so highly of what they're trying to say that it irritates me just thinking about it.  The fact is...they have nothing to say and what they are doing has very little significance to people who actually have talent (ie, those of us who don't need to ""say"" anything).If Zwigoff focused on this and made a mockery of the entire `art-scene', that might be enough to make a entertaining film, but there isn't enough in here, really.`Art School Confidential' gets too boggled down in a courtship where the main kid seemingly finds his first infatuation in a figure model at school.  The two of them are so uninteresting that it made me yearn for some art school-critique talk from some of the hippies in the film.It tried too hard to go over the top with some of it's jokes (male models walking up to female students where her eye level is at his pelvis level, the obnoxious roommate who offers nothing but `can I smell your finger' quirks).It would have been nice if the story actually followed this student, who knew he was better than everyone else (and he was), ridicule the rest of the students who had absolutely nothing to offer the world (which is, essentially, about 98% of all ""artists"").Instead it turns into your standard, boy tries to impress girl by stealing someone else's artwork who just happens to be a serial killer story.  Wrong direction.  There are/were too many opportunities to make fun of these types passed up for something that's been overdone way too many times.  Terry should have known better!There is a very entertaining Thanksgiving Dinner scene, which was worth two stars from me.  The overbearing female who takes her artwork way too seriously even though it's complete trash was also amusing, so that earns two stars.Just not enough irritating art-scene comedy in here to recommend it at all.",2,Just Like Anything Pablo Picasso Ever Painted,1170028800,"01 29, 2007",2007,2523,"['first', 'thing', 'came', 'so', 'called', 'mind', 'completion', 'film', 'was', 'What', 'was', 'Terry', 'Zwigoff', 'thinking', 'responsible', 'documentary', 'Robert', 'Crumb', 'entitled', 'Crumb', 'was', 'one', 'better', 'films', 'made', 'last', 'two', 'decades', 'Bad', 'Santa', 'was', 'very', 'big', 'surprise', 'as', 'well', 'am', 'caught', 'scratching', 'head', 'why', 'decided', 'particular', 'script', 'and/or', 'subject', 'matter', 'was', 'worth', 'making', 'feature', 'presentation', 'over.For', 'starters', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'serious', 'artists', 'who', 'over-emphasize', 'importance', 'craft', 'are', 'most', 'annoying', 'people', 'planet', 'can', 'say', 'went', 'department', 'type', 'person', 'are', 'self', 'indulged', 'think', 'so', 'highly', 'what', ""'re"", 'trying', 'say', 'just', 'thinking', 'fact', 'have', 'nothing', 'say', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'very', 'little', 'significance', 'people', 'who', 'actually', 'have', 'talent', 'ie', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'say', 'anything', 'Zwigoff', 'focused', 'made', 'mockery', 'entire', 'art-scene', 'might', 'be', 'enough', 'make', 'entertaining', 'film', ""n't"", 'enough', 'here', 'really.', 'Art', 'School', 'Confidential', 'too', 'boggled', 'down', 'courtship', 'where', 'main', 'kid', 'seemingly', 'first', 'infatuation', 'figure', 'model', 'school', 'two', 'are', 'so', 'uninteresting', 'made', 'yearn', 'art', 'school-critique', 'talk', 'hippies', 'film.It', 'tried', 'too', 'hard', 'go', 'top', 'jokes', 'male', 'models', 'walking', 'up', 'female', 'students', 'where', 'eye', 'level', 'pelvis', 'level', 'obnoxious', 'roommate', 'who', 'nothing', 'can', 'smell', 'finger', 'quirks', '.It', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'story', 'actually', 'followed', 'student', 'who', 'knew', 'was', 'better', 'everyone', 'else', 'was', 'ridicule', 'rest', 'students', 'who', 'had', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'offer', 'world', 'essentially', 'about', '98', '%', 'artists', '.Instead', 'standard', 'boy', 'tries', 'impress', 'girl', 'stealing', 'someone', 'else', 'artwork', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'serial', 'killer', 'story', 'Wrong', 'direction', 'are/were', 'too', 'many', 'opportunities', 'make', 'fun', 'types', 'passed', 'up', 'something', 'been', 'overdone', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'Terry', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'better', 'very', 'entertaining', 'Thanksgiving', 'Dinner', 'scene', 'was', 'worth', 'two', 'stars', 'overbearing', 'female', 'who', 'artwork', 'way', 'too', 'seriously', 'even', 'complete', 'trash', 'was', 'also', 'amusing', 'two', 'stars.Just', 'not', 'enough', 'irritating', 'art-scene', 'comedy', 'here', 'recommend']",N/A

The characters are mostly drawn in such raging generalities that you can pretty much recite the lines before they actors say them.  I wonder if those casting the film have ever met a college student.  They had the varieties right, but the ages were goofy.  The obnoxious film student looked 40, the dream girl model looked more like the hero's big sister than his girlfriend.  The story, on the other hand is interesting in an art-house kind of way but there is so, so much wrong!  Even in the capable hands of Jim Broadbent, the villian of the piece is underdrawn.

1010580,A1SPB225CVTRUU,B000H6SXSI,"Wing Lee ""filmfan""","[1, 3]","I must say that Art School Confidential has mass appeal to me because the trailer was very funny and it's got an irresistable cast include John Malkovich, Jim Broadbent, and Anjelica Houston. Besides the three participations of such amazing veterans, this film is a star-making vehicle for Max Minghella who plays a naive and innocent art student. In this film, his characters has to go through the inevitable nasty treatments from his peers and ultimately he has to come to realize his purpose as an artist and how he can survive the side effects of the art world. The film's weaker and less stimulating than Zwigoff's Ghost World, a film that bought out the best of Thora Birch and Steve Busemi(who also makes a cameo apperance in A.S.C.) I just didn't like about the whole murder subplot and there's a lack of witty and funny moments in this film that sometimes I am bored by it. I really wanted more from Malkovich, but his part is too lowkey and limiting. Houston is totally underused and wasted in this film as one of the professors and she had several scenes that looked bland compared to art school teacher played by Illeana Douglas in G.W. Jim Broadbent is truly a scene-stealer in this film and he's by far a more memorable character. He plays a down and out seen-it-all kind of self-loathing underaccomplished genius. Yes, there is some male and female nude models in the life portraits scenes, and there's some cheesy gay and sex jokes on and off throughout the film. I think this film failed to connect to me, because it's so busy and covered a lot of materials and it should've focus on a central plot.",3,"Great Cast, Not as Great as Ghost World.",1147305600,"05 11, 2006",2006,1616,"['must', 'say', 'Art', 'School', 'Confidential', 'mass', 'appeal', 'trailer', 'was', 'very', 'funny', 'got', 'irresistable', 'cast', 'include', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'Anjelica', 'Houston', 'three', 'participations', 'such', 'amazing', 'veterans', 'film', 'star-making', 'vehicle', 'Max', 'Minghella', 'who', 'naive', 'innocent', 'art', 'student', 'film', 'characters', 'go', 'inevitable', 'nasty', 'treatments', 'peers', 'ultimately', 'come', 'realize', 'purpose', 'artist', 'how', 'can', 'survive', 'side', 'effects', 'art', 'world', 'film', 'weaker', 'less', 'stimulating', 'Zwigoff', 'Ghost', 'World', 'film', 'bought', 'out', 'best', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'Steve', 'Busemi', 'who', 'also', 'cameo', 'apperance', 'A.S.C', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'whole', 'murder', 'subplot', 'lack', 'witty', 'funny', 'moments', 'film', 'am', 'bored', 'really', 'wanted', 'more', 'Malkovich', 'part', 'too', 'lowkey', 'limiting', 'Houston', 'totally', 'underused', 'wasted', 'film', 'one', 'professors', 'had', 'several', 'scenes', 'looked', 'bland', 'compared', 'art', 'school', 'teacher', 'played', 'Illeana', 'Douglas', 'G.W', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'truly', 'scene-stealer', 'film', 'far', 'more', 'memorable', 'character', 'down', 'seen-it-all', 'kind', 'self-loathing', 'underaccomplished', 'genius', 'Yes', 'male', 'female', 'nude', 'models', 'life', 'portraits', 'scenes', 'cheesy', 'gay', 'sex', 'jokes', 'film', 'think', 'film', 'failed', 'connect', 'so', 'busy', 'covered', 'lot', 'materials', 'should', ""'ve"", 'focus', 'central', 'plot']",N/A
