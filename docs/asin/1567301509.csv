184671,A307BEM1CF066U,1567301509,a viewer,"[16, 34]","I never saw this film in the theater, so I can't be completely sure that this is how it's supposed to look. But, assuming that the DVD transfer is accurate, I find all the praise for Kore-eda's ""painterly"" visuals completely undeserved. The film is shot entirely with natural light; so, in the daytime indoor scenes, the glare from windows and doorways blots out or silhouettes everything; and in the nightime indoor scenes, everything is murky and underexposed. It all looks horribly amateurish. The outdooor scenes come off somewhat better, but slightly grainy overall, almost as if they had been shot on a digital camera.Cinematography (and possible bad transfer) aside, there's also the matter of Kore-eda's excessively static direction. I can appreciate the still, quiet camera work of Ozu or Jarmusch, but Kore-eda takes this style and pushes it to ridiculous lengths. His camera NEVER moves, not even for an occasional cut or panning or tracking shot. It just sits there, dull and inert, while the scenes drag on and on and then abruptly end, almost arbitrarily. I guess this technique is supposed to impart a contemplative effect to a scene, but again, it just seems amateurish.The performance by fashion-model-turned-actress Makiko Esumi, as the grieving young widow Yumiko, reflects the director's numb, soporific visual style. Instead of being quietly torn by grief, she comes across as merely affectless. Maybe the director wanted to use a zombie-like non-actress and comatose camera work to convey the numbness of grief, but the result is far from edifying or moving or even interesting. The ultimate effect of this movie is only stupefying boredom.",1,"boring, overrated",1113609600,"04 16, 2005",2005,1662,"['never', 'saw', 'film', 'theater', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'completely', 'sure', 'how', 'supposed', 'look', 'assuming', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'accurate', 'find', 'praise', 'Kore-eda', 'painterly', 'visuals', 'completely', 'undeserved', 'film', 'shot', 'entirely', 'natural', 'light', 'so', 'daytime', 'indoor', 'scenes', 'glare', 'windows', 'doorways', 'blots', 'out', 'silhouettes', 'everything', 'nightime', 'indoor', 'scenes', 'everything', 'murky', 'underexposed', 'horribly', 'amateurish', 'outdooor', 'scenes', 'come', 'off', 'somewhat', 'better', 'slightly', 'grainy', 'overall', 'almost', 'had', 'been', 'shot', 'digital', 'camera.Cinematography', 'possible', 'bad', 'transfer', 'aside', 'also', 'matter', 'Kore-eda', 'excessively', 'static', 'direction', 'can', 'appreciate', 'still', 'quiet', 'camera', 'work', 'Ozu', 'Jarmusch', 'Kore-eda', 'style', 'ridiculous', 'lengths', 'camera', 'NEVER', 'not', 'even', 'occasional', 'cut', 'panning', 'tracking', 'shot', 'just', 'there', 'dull', 'inert', 'scenes', 'drag', 'then', 'abruptly', 'end', 'almost', 'arbitrarily', 'guess', 'technique', 'supposed', 'impart', 'contemplative', 'effect', 'scene', 'again', 'just', 'amateurish.The', 'performance', 'fashion-model-turned-actress', 'Makiko', 'Esumi', 'grieving', 'young', 'widow', 'Yumiko', 'director', 'numb', 'soporific', 'visual', 'style', 'Instead', 'being', 'quietly', 'torn', 'grief', 'merely', 'affectless', 'Maybe', 'director', 'wanted', 'use', 'zombie-like', 'non-actress', 'comatose', 'camera', 'work', 'convey', 'numbness', 'grief', 'result', 'far', 'edifying', 'moving', 'even', 'interesting', 'ultimate', 'effect', 'movie', 'only', 'stupefying', 'boredom']",N/A
184672,AYP0Z0FLR9Z0R,1567301509,avoraciousreader,"[6, 8]","I picked up Maborosi thinking it was another Japanese film I'd seen mentioned, so had no idea what to expect.  And, with no buzz to prepare me, I still had little idea what was going on until near the very end.Since there is little dialog, one is left to interpret a series of lengthy set shots. Many go on so long one expects they have Significance-with-a-capital-S to those imbued with Japanese culture, but I was left screaming &quot;what does 5 minutes of washing stairs Mean?&quot;This is compounded by the director's conscious choice to film primarily with the characters at extreme distance or in heavy shadow.  At the front row of a regular theatre this may fly, but on a home screen, even watching closely, I was often at a loss to figure out which character I was watching, much less detect subtle nuances of expression or action.  Even watching it 2 or 3 times, I was still not sure what happened at the end of the stair scrubbing scene.  Given that the director's background is in television, this is surprising, or perhaps he just went overboard with the freedom of a new medium.The film is visually beautiful, even in the scenes where the characters are almost hidden, and the snapshots of traditional/rural Japanese life and material culture are fascinating. But the almost total lack of moving shots seems like a little too cute of a restriction of vocabulary.  As one reviewer said, like a slide show rather than cinema.I also felt a lack of context, much of it I'm sure because I'm not Japanese nor deeply familiar with the culture.  But part of a director's work must surely be to create context.  For instance, from the commentary on the DVD, I gather that the setting was shortly post-WWII, but though subtle cues of dress or automobile or song may have shown this, or simply the lack of high tech city life, it was not at all clear to this viewer until watching that commentary after the film.  And this seems to have been an important point in the director's mind.I do, however, plan to view the DVD again before returning it, now that I know what it's supposed to be about :-).",3,Beautiful but confusing,1041811200,"01 6, 2003",2003,2101,"['picked', 'up', 'Maborosi', 'thinking', 'was', 'Japanese', 'film', ""'d"", 'seen', 'mentioned', 'so', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'expect', 'buzz', 'prepare', 'still', 'had', 'little', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'very', 'end.Since', 'little', 'dialog', 'one', 'left', 'interpret', 'series', 'lengthy', 'set', 'shots', 'Many', 'go', 'so', 'long', 'one', 'have', 'Significance-with-a-capital-S', 'imbued', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'was', 'left', 'screaming', 'quot', 'what', '5', 'minutes', 'washing', 'stairs', 'Mean', 'quot', 'compounded', 'director', 'conscious', 'choice', 'film', 'primarily', 'characters', 'extreme', 'distance', 'heavy', 'shadow', 'front', 'row', 'regular', 'theatre', 'may', 'fly', 'home', 'screen', 'even', 'watching', 'closely', 'was', 'often', 'loss', 'figure', 'out', 'character', 'was', 'watching', 'much', 'less', 'detect', 'subtle', 'nuances', 'expression', 'action', 'Even', 'watching', '2', '3', 'times', 'was', 'still', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'happened', 'end', 'stair', 'scrubbing', 'scene', 'Given', 'director', 'background', 'television', 'surprising', 'perhaps', 'just', 'went', 'overboard', 'freedom', 'new', 'medium.The', 'film', 'visually', 'beautiful', 'even', 'scenes', 'where', 'characters', 'are', 'almost', 'hidden', 'snapshots', 'traditional/rural', 'Japanese', 'life', 'material', 'culture', 'are', 'fascinating', 'almost', 'total', 'lack', 'moving', 'shots', 'little', 'too', 'cute', 'restriction', 'vocabulary', 'one', 'reviewer', 'said', 'slide', 'show', 'rather', 'cinema.I', 'also', 'felt', 'lack', 'context', 'much', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'m"", 'not', 'Japanese', 'deeply', 'familiar', 'culture', 'part', 'director', 'work', 'must', 'surely', 'be', 'create', 'context', 'instance', 'commentary', 'DVD', 'gather', 'setting', 'was', 'shortly', 'post-WWII', 'subtle', 'cues', 'dress', 'automobile', 'song', 'may', 'have', 'shown', 'simply', 'lack', 'high', 'tech', 'city', 'life', 'was', 'not', 'clear', 'viewer', 'watching', 'commentary', 'film', 'have', 'been', 'important', 'point', 'director', 'mind.I', 'do', 'however', 'plan', 'view', 'DVD', 'again', 'returning', 'now', 'know', 'what', 'supposed', 'be']",N/A

The film is presented in Japanese with English subtitles.Synopsis: How does one cope with the suicide of a loved one? Such is the case with Yumiko (Makiko Esumi) leaving her with a three month old son and a myriad of unanswered questions. Yumiko is given a second chance for happiness with a new husband at a new location in a scenic oceanfront community away from the people and places of the past. Unfortunately memories are not so easily left behind. As thoughts of her first husband continue to return to her mind just as the ebb and flow of the ocean returns to the shore she must come to grips with lifes' uncertainties and learn to accept the unacceptable.Critique: Kore-eda Hirokazu's '97 film `Maborosi' (""a strange light far out to sea"") is a subtle, gentle flowing study in light and shadow, loss and fulfillment, life and death. Makiko Esumi is pure poetry in the lead role as the grieving Yumiko gliding silently and elegantly in and out of the shadows like a beautiful apparition. Accompanied by a traditional ethnic soundtrack, many times only a guiet melody of a piano `Maborosi' definitely creates a somber atmosphere that the viewer should be aware of. If you're not in the appropriate mood you won't last long.  However if you're in the right mood for restrained, detached melancholy as only the Japanese can do, here it is.",5,"""The Sea's Quite Loud"" ~ Longing For Yesterday, Contentment With Today",1190678400,"09 25, 2007",2007,1397,"['Note', 'Product', 'Details', 'information', 'incorrect', 'film', 'presented', 'Japanese', 'English', 'subtitles.Synopsis', 'How', 'one', 'cope', 'suicide', 'loved', 'one', 'Such', 'case', 'Yumiko', 'Makiko', 'Esumi', 'leaving', 'three', 'month', 'old', 'son', 'myriad', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'Yumiko', 'given', 'second', 'chance', 'happiness', 'new', 'husband', 'new', 'location', 'scenic', 'oceanfront', 'community', 'away', 'people', 'places', 'past', 'Unfortunately', 'memories', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'easily', 'left', 'behind', 'thoughts', 'first', 'husband', 'continue', 'return', 'mind', 'just', 'ebb', 'flow', 'ocean', 'returns', 'shore', 'must', 'come', 'grips', 'lifes', 'uncertainties', 'learn', 'accept', 'unacceptable.Critique', 'Kore-eda', 'Hirokazu', ""'97"", 'film', 'Maborosi', 'strange', 'light', 'far', 'sea', 'subtle', 'gentle', 'flowing', 'study', 'light', 'shadow', 'loss', 'fulfillment', 'life', 'death', 'Makiko', 'Esumi', 'pure', 'poetry', 'lead', 'role', 'grieving', 'Yumiko', 'gliding', 'silently', 'elegantly', 'shadows', 'beautiful', 'apparition', 'Accompanied', 'traditional', 'ethnic', 'soundtrack', 'many', 'times', 'only', 'guiet', 'melody', 'piano', 'Maborosi', 'definitely', 'somber', 'atmosphere', 'viewer', 'should', 'be', 'aware', ""'re"", 'not', 'appropriate', 'mood', 'wo', ""n't"", 'last', 'long', 'However', ""'re"", 'right', 'mood', 'restrained', 'detached', 'melancholy', 'only', 'Japanese', 'can', 'do', 'here']",N/A

She is unable to form warm human connections or escape the pull of the past.This film is beautifully composed.

Yumiko, her husband, and 3 month old son live in a small apartment in Osaka, evidently very much in love. We are privileged to view their lives in its elegant simplicity. Her husband bicycles to work at a factory nearby. Yumiko and he bicycle together to a nearby restaurant for coffee. Yumiko is haunted by a past event where her grandmother leaves the family to die in her own village ... It was her last wish.Sadly, Yumiko gets a knock on the door, as several police officers ask about her husband and his job. She is accompanied to the police station where she is presented his belongings. There she is told, he walked in front of an oncoming train, despite its warnings, he kept on walking ... an apparent suicide. She is discouraged from viewing what is left of his body. She is distaught and receives help from a neighbor and her mother ... As time passes, four years go by, and a kindly neighbor becomes match-maker, as her son and she board a train to northern Japan to a small fishing village.Yumiko partakes of a wedding celebration with her new husband, a haunting beautiful ballad is sung by a male guest as the wedding guests clap out the rhythm. Her new life begins ... The stark beauty of the mountain scenery, the shore, the village, and ocean are superbly filmed. Yumiko's son and stepdaughter explore the coast in breath-taking scenery ... Yumiko is enculturated into the lifestyle of the village. During one haunting scene, a group of villagers walk along a road to the sea coast ... There is a bonfire which could be a funeral pyre for someone. Yumiko is met by her husband as she sobs out her questions, why did he kill himself, what made him do it?

184678,A2F5PAC9I5SCG6,1567301509,Ernest Jagger,"[4, 6]","This film received many awards and praise when it was released 10 years ago. And at one time, I did not find ""Maborosi,"" to be as great a film as I do today. ""Maborosi,"" moves at a very slow pace, and patience is required. It is not a film for everyone, but if you give it a chance and allow the film to take you into the grieving process of a woman whose husband has just died, then this film will reward you. The film itself gives the viewer a very subtle and nuanced view of the life of a woman, who prior to losing her husband, shares moments with him. The director clearly wants to take the viewer into the life of these two happy couples before tragedy occurs. And he does not do this by throwing it at our face.We all face grief at one time in our lives--and especially when death occurs. How each of us deal with this grief is different. There is a simplicity to the film that never throws itself at the viewer. Almost as if one is watching a real life drama unfold on camera. We see that both of these couples are happy with each other. We see the husband (Tadanobu Asano) at work, while the wife comes to take a peek at her beloved husband. But tragedy is about to take hold of this woman. When her husband dies, Yumiko (Makiko Esumi) grieves at the loss of her husband, and we the viewer understand the grief that she is going through. We have seen the love she has for him, and now she feels emptiness. How many of us have not felt the same at least one time in our lives? We sympathize, and empathize with what she is going through. But this is her grief, and we are distant observers.She loved her husband, and her way of expressing her sadness is deeply moving. For her, there must be a mistake in the death of her husband, when the police tell her how he died. They were too much in love for him to commit suicide. It must be something else? An accident perhaps? But this is a film about life, and it is the unexpectedness of life that makes the film so profound. It is the films own subtlety that breathes life into the film. Moreover, we viewers are also given a glimpse in the beginning of the film at the early childhood of Yumiko, as she watches her grandmother leave Osaka, and depart for Shikoku to die.The film is a recommended viewing for those who like films dealing with life. This is good dramatic film, in regards to the grief that Yumiko (Makiko Esumi) is going through. Plus, we see how Yumiko adjusts to a new chapter in her life with her newfound happiness with another man. This allows us to see that life does indeed go on. But we still carry our past with us: and we are still allowed to grieve. Furthermore, sometimes, and many times, there is no such thing as closure. Sometimes we allow the door to stay slightly ajar. For who can say when or where we should stop grieving? Once again, the film does take patience to view, which is fine with me. I like films that explore the human condition, and grief is definitely a major one we all go through in life. I bought this film years ago, and did not particularly think it was great at the time. I do now.Director Kore-eda Hirokazu did a great job portraying the human condition  in this film: for we must all face death, dying, loss, and grief at some point in our lives. And these were common themes in his films. Furthermore, the film has some splendid cinematography of Japan. There are some parts where the film is dark and could be cleaned up a bit, but on a whole, this is minor compared to the film itself. I recommend that you view the film. However, I recommend that you rent it first, as it may not be a film you might enjoy. It took me a few viewings to really like this film, plus, factor in my age since I last saw it, and I have found this film much greater than what I initially thought it was. Age has a way of doing that. Hopefully you will find something in this film that you can take away with you. Recommended.

184679,A11GVIS6AXDEAX,1567301509,James Chong,"[7, 9]","I first watched Kore-eda's film several years ago and was left with mixed emotions. Technically, I felt that the film was a masterwork, with some of the most stunningly composed and beautifully spare frames I had seen since Zhang Yimou's masterpiece, ""Raise the Red Lantern."" However, emotionally I felt distant from the characters, including the grieving widow, Yumiko, and I blamed the same highly-disciplined technical approach that I admired for this.I have since re-watched the film after some difficult personal years in which I struggled with an almost immobilizing depression, and I've come to the realization that, more so than most films, ""Maborosi"" is a work that one can only truly appreciate and love if one has a direct personal connection to the type of suffering that Yumiko faces. And to me, this film is not simply about coping with the loss of a loved one or even the fear of abandonment. For me, this is a film that explores the different faces of depression, whether it be clinical - meaning, without any objectively attributable motivating factor (as is evidently the case with Yumiko's first husband, Ikuo) - or situational (such as what Yumiko deals with from feeling repeatedly ""abandoned"" by key figures in her life).What I was most struck with by ""Maborosi"" was the incredibly sensitive and subtle ways in which Kore-eda examines the frustration, devastating grief, and even anger that Yumiko feels as she struggles to come to terms with Ikuo's apparently inexplicable suicide. And in fact, when suicidal people think of the loved ones that they will be leaving behind, it is precisely the type of confused suffering and self-doubt that Yumiko experiences that we know will be the fate of our friends and family members. That Kore-eda is able to capture this truth is a testament to his remarkable insight into humanity and the complex psychology of loss. In this sense, he has much in common with Canadian director Atom Egoyan, whose ""The Sweet Hereafter"" is one of the most accomplished cinematic explorations of this type of subject matter.I can now easily say that ""Maborosi"" is one of my very favorite films. Kore-eda has said that he chose the actress Makiko Esumi to play Yumiko because of the power behind her eyes. And, indeed, that one lingering moment when Yumiko gazes directly into the camera is one of the most haunting in the film, for we feel as if we are staring straight down into this young woman's soul, into the deep well of strength that shines through the raw pain and confusion. Somehow, we know long before the peaceful closing scene that she will make it out of this just fine.This film has been called a ""visual tone poem"" of sorts, and Kore-eda's mastery of visual composition just serves to illustrate that he is one of a select group of filmmakers, following the tradition of masters like Bergman, Fellini, Kubrick, and Malick, who know how to use the medium to its fullest potential. When the image can tell the story with as much subtlety and quiet power as is on display in this film, words are truly unnecessary.

While I acknowledge that many have found a lyrical meaning in this film, I was not one of them.  Many of the scenes are shot so darkly, that you find yourself watching a crack of sky through a window for several minutes.  Actually, I can look out my own window to experience that.  Hirokazu Kore-eda was a documentary filmmaker before shooting this first feature.  It is a major snooze-fest, threatening sleeping pill manufacturers as a better cure for insomnia.Yukimo is a young married woman.  Played by Makiko Esumi who would also star in ""Pistol Opera"" in 2002, she is a mostly stoic figure.  Stoicism can be used effectively such as how Michael Caine employs it in the recent filmSleuth.  There, the words that are said help the viewer interpret Caine's frozen stares as deep and assign thought and emotion.  Here, there is very little dialogue so Esumi mostly seems blank.  Obviously, the film is about grief.  I've experienced this emotion.  Grief can make you wail and can close you from the world.  Unfortunately, Esumi does not keep us interested.First husband Ikuo played by Tadanobu Asano who won the Best Actor prize from the Venice International Film Festival in 2003 for another very boring film,Last Life in the Universe, adds some life as the husband.  Why he dallies on the train tracks is a mystery.  I thought he must have been wearing an I-pod or a Walkman back in 1995.  But no!  We're expected to believe that a dad with a three-month old is so depressed that he shows no signs of it and then plays splatter with the railroad train.  The film really is unexplained and does not make sense.Goki Kashiyama is very good as the son Yuichi.  Taketoshi Naito who was in ""Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence,"" plays Tamio, Yukimo's second husband.  They cavort and have some fun.  Much of it is in the dark.  This film won Best Cinematography for Masao Nakabori at the 1995 Venice Film Festival.  There are nice sequences on the beach.  The funeral procession on the beach is impressive and is also extremely long.  In the end, ""Illusory Light"" is an illusory film.  I'm happy for those for whom it has captured their imaginations.  For me, I hope that I will now recall the film so that I never have to sit through it again.
