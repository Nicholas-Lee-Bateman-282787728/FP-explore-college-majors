1240551,A28RPKXOVO41AW,B001UV4XHY,Alyson C. Miller,"[2, 5]","*SPOILERS*Book 7 was not my favorite book, mostly because I feel like Rowling just killed people off for the sake of killing them off, and she really should have let SOME of my favorite characters live through it.That being said, part one was pretty true to the book (as others have stated), so most of my complaints about it are the same ones I had about the book (too slow, Ron being whiny, too many pointless deaths, etc).  I really did not enjoy the dance scene between Harry and Hermione.  I felt uncomfortably like a peeping tom while watching it (I don't go to movies to feel uncomfortable), and I don't like that they tried to create ""tension"" between Harry and Hermione.  They are just friends, and I don't know why they decided to spend 30 seconds flirting with the idea of 'more'.I really did not think that they gave Hedwig's death enough time or showed very well how upsetting it was to Harry.  When Dobby died, I could not understand why someone didn't try to help him.  They just sat there looking sad at him.  Harry has been injured badly several times, and they always manage to heal him back up...but Dobby isn't worth it?It really was too long.  I hate how all 'serious' movies seem like they are required to be over 2 hours long anymore.  This one, with a lot of material, could be justifiably long, but if I find myself sitting in the theatre hoping for it to end, then in my opinion the story or the director has at least partially failed.  I enjoyed the movie, but I still felt I was in that theatre for about 4 hours, and the last 30 minutes of the film every time the screen went dark I prayed that it was over.  I know that sounds conflicted, but its how I felt about it.I also hate the ""shaky camera"" fad in movies over the last decade.  This one wasn't too bad about it, but it felt like all of the non-action scenes were filmed with a little flip camera by a high school student.  I wanted to shout at the director to invest in a tripod.My only other minor complaint is that the director seemed to really enjoy having the bad guys straddle the good guys (dead or alive), and it felt awkward.I still really liked it, but I won't be watching it again til it comes out on DVD, whereas previous installations I have seen in the theatre several times.  I will, of course, go see the second part, but I don't really look forward to it.  I dont want all the characters to die off.  I almost hope that pt 2 will be a classic example of hollywood rewriting so that at least a few of the good background people live.To address the complaints of ""confusing"", my advice is to watch the first 6 movies.  its part 7.  its not supposed to be a stand alone.  if you've watched the first 6 movies, then its really not confusing at all.so, to sum up (now that I've complained enough)Pros:great actingtrue to bookgood storyenjoyablecons:shaky cameratoo long (multiple ""false"" ending spots)awkward scenes that didn't 'fit'.go see it in the theatre. its as worth the 10 buck admission price as any other movie of recent release.",4,"pretty good, but too long",1290297600,"11 21, 2010",2010,3036,"['*SPOILERS*Book', '7', 'was', 'not', 'favorite', 'book', 'mostly', 'feel', 'Rowling', 'just', 'killed', 'people', 'sake', 'killing', 'off', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'let', 'SOME', 'favorite', 'characters', 'live', 'it.That', 'being', 'said', 'part', 'one', 'was', 'pretty', 'true', 'book', 'others', 'have', 'stated', 'so', 'most', 'complaints', 'are', 'same', 'ones', 'had', 'book', 'too', 'slow', 'Ron', 'being', 'whiny', 'too', 'many', 'pointless', 'deaths', 'etc', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'enjoy', 'dance', 'scene', 'Harry', 'Hermione', 'felt', 'uncomfortably', 'peeping', 'tom', 'watching', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'movies', 'feel', 'uncomfortable', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'tried', 'create', 'tension', 'Harry', 'Hermione', 'are', 'just', 'friends', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'decided', 'spend', '30', 'seconds', 'flirting', 'idea', ""'more'.I"", 'really', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'gave', 'Hedwig', 'death', 'enough', 'time', 'showed', 'very', 'well', 'how', 'upsetting', 'was', 'Harry', 'When', 'Dobby', 'died', 'could', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'someone', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'help', 'just', 'sat', 'looking', 'sad', 'Harry', 'been', 'injured', 'badly', 'several', 'times', 'always', 'manage', 'heal', 'back', 'Dobby', ""n't"", 'worth', 'really', 'was', 'too', 'long', 'hate', 'how', ""'serious"", 'movies', 'seem', 'are', 'required', 'be', '2', 'hours', 'long', 'anymore', 'one', 'lot', 'material', 'could', 'be', 'justifiably', 'long', 'find', 'sitting', 'theatre', 'hoping', 'end', 'then', 'opinion', 'story', 'director', 'least', 'partially', 'failed', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'still', 'felt', 'was', 'theatre', '4', 'hours', 'last', '30', 'minutes', 'film', 'time', 'screen', 'went', 'dark', 'prayed', 'was', 'know', 'conflicted', 'how', 'felt', 'it.I', 'also', 'hate', 'shaky', 'camera', 'fad', 'movies', 'last', 'decade', 'one', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'felt', 'non-action', 'scenes', 'were', 'filmed', 'little', 'flip', 'camera', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'wanted', 'shout', 'director', 'invest', 'tripod.My', 'only', 'other', 'minor', 'complaint', 'director', 'seemed', 'really', 'enjoy', 'having', 'bad', 'guys', 'straddle', 'good', 'guys', 'dead', 'alive', 'felt', 'awkward.I', 'still', 'really', 'liked', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'watching', 'again', 'out', 'DVD', 'whereas', 'previous', 'installations', 'have', 'seen', 'theatre', 'several', 'times', 'will', 'course', 'go', 'see', 'second', 'part', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'look', 'forward', 'dont', 'want', 'characters', 'die', 'off', 'almost', 'hope', 'pt', '2', 'will', 'be', 'classic', 'example', 'hollywood', 'rewriting', 'so', 'that', 'least', 'few', 'good', 'background', 'people', 'live.To', 'complaints', 'confusing', 'advice', 'watch', 'first', '6', 'movies', 'part', '7.', 'not', 'supposed', 'be', 'stand', 'alone', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'first', '6', 'movies', 'then', 'really', 'not', 'confusing', 'all.so', 'sum', 'up', 'now', ""'ve"", 'complained', 'enough', 'Pros', 'great', 'actingtrue', 'bookgood', 'storyenjoyablecons', 'shaky', 'cameratoo', 'long', 'multiple', 'false', 'ending', 'spots', 'awkward', 'scenes', 'did', ""n't"", ""'fit'.go"", 'see', 'theatre', 'worth', '10', 'buck', 'admission', 'price', 'other', 'movie', 'recent', 'release']",N/A

(Not the longest book, nor the book with the most events, but I'm sure Warner Brothers is now kicking themselves and wishing they'd started splitting these back at Azkaban to make twice as much money.)I haven't changed my opinion of the book -- which is, by far, the worst of the series, with a sag in the middle like a couch that Hagrid just sat on -- and the movie is as deeply faithful to the book in the way that this series of movies always has been...and that means, of course, that it's full of dull, dreary camping sequences, in which Harry, Ron, and Hermoine mope at each other for what feels like the full eight months the book covers.(Somewhere in the middle of that, my younger son quietly stated that he wasn't having any fun and went up to his room to play. When your movie isn't more entertaining than playing alone with dominoes, you've got a serious problem.)The plot makes as much sense here as it did in the book: which is to say, it's still the quintessentially English story about a boy who definitely isn't too smart for his station, but is indomitable enough to muddle through because his heart is true. Rowling has no interest in a resistance movement against her magical dictator, nor does she care about what's happening to the UK under Voldemort (much less the rest of the world, which nearly doesn't exist in the Harry Potter world), or even in depicting Harry Potter as any kind of leader or competent hero.No, instead Deathly Hallows 1 is the story of three friends (who hate each other) hiding out in the woods instead of trying to find the seven magical [Plot Coupons] Horcruxes, which they need (along with three pounds fifty in coins) to send off to Rowling for an ending. And this movie doesn't even get them to the point where they actually start to accomplish their quest, so it's entirely ominous beginning and dreary middle. This is the movie you have to get through to get Deathly Hallows 2, and you'd have to be a stone Potter fan -- the kind unwilling to admit anything connected to Rowling is less than fabulous -- to strongly enjoy it as a movie in its own right.",2,Probably more fun for those who like extended camping sequences,1306713600,"05 30, 2011",2011,2221,"['movie', 'first', 'half', 'dullest', 'dreariest', 'series', 'books', 'J.K.', 'Rowling', 'Not', 'longest', 'book', 'book', 'most', 'events', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'now', 'kicking', 'wishing', ""'d"", 'started', 'splitting', 'back', 'Azkaban', 'make', 'twice', 'as', 'much', 'money', 'have', ""n't"", 'changed', 'opinion', 'book', 'far', 'worst', 'series', 'sag', 'middle', 'couch', 'Hagrid', 'just', 'sat', 'movie', 'deeply', 'faithful', 'book', 'way', 'series', 'movies', 'always', 'been', 'course', 'full', 'dull', 'dreary', 'camping', 'sequences', 'Harry', 'Ron', 'Hermoine', 'mope', 'other', 'what', 'feels', 'full', 'eight', 'months', 'book', 'Somewhere', 'middle', 'younger', 'son', 'quietly', 'stated', 'was', ""n't"", 'having', 'fun', 'went', 'up', 'room', 'play', 'When', 'movie', ""n't"", 'more', 'entertaining', 'playing', 'alone', 'dominoes', ""'ve"", 'got', 'serious', 'problem', 'plot', 'as', 'much', 'sense', 'here', 'did', 'book', 'say', 'still', 'quintessentially', 'English', 'story', 'boy', 'who', 'definitely', ""n't"", 'too', 'smart', 'station', 'indomitable', 'enough', 'muddle', 'heart', 'true', 'Rowling', 'interest', 'resistance', 'movement', 'magical', 'dictator', 'care', 'what', 'happening', 'UK', 'Voldemort', 'much', 'less', 'rest', 'world', 'nearly', ""n't"", 'exist', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'world', 'even', 'depicting', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'kind', 'leader', 'competent', 'hero.No', 'instead', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', '1', 'story', 'three', 'friends', 'who', 'hate', 'other', 'hiding', 'out', 'woods', 'instead', 'trying', 'find', 'seven', 'magical', '[', 'Plot', 'Coupons', ']', 'Horcruxes', 'need', 'three', 'pounds', 'fifty', 'coins', 'send', 'off', 'Rowling', 'ending', 'movie', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'point', 'where', 'actually', 'start', 'accomplish', 'quest', 'entirely', 'ominous', 'beginning', 'dreary', 'middle', 'movie', 'have', 'get', 'get', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', '2', ""'d"", 'have', 'be', 'stone', 'Potter', 'fan', 'kind', 'unwilling', 'admit', 'anything', 'connected', 'Rowling', 'less', 'fabulous', 'strongly', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'own', 'right']",N/A

1240573,A5EKUC02QJKWE,B001UV4XHY,"A. Rodriguez ""Kapuffy""","[3, 5]","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 has the feel of a post-apocalyptic film, as certain scenes draw visual comparisons to the harrowing film The Road with Viggo Mortensen. I am very biased since I grew up reading Harry Potter and I feel I have an allegiance to the material that cannot be broken by any means, which basically implies that this review may not be helpful to people who are non-fans. I am a lover of film and noticed this installment's shortcomings; it had a few. There were some editing mistakes I caught onto in a variety of scenes and certain obscurities in the script. However, these were only mild shortcomings, because the film delivered in almost every other respect. For one thing, director David Yates has developed and has almost mastered his craft as a filmmaker. I remember looking back to his debut film Order of the Phoenix, and observing his shaky work. I really enjoyed that HP film, but I felt as though Yates was failing to take the risks necessary to make an epic fantasy film. His choice of camera angles and shots were too self-contained and his lack of establishing shots and scenes was very apparent. In Half-Blood Prince, it was obvious Yates was beginning to realize the artistic appeal of the series, becoming more focused on delivering an emotionally dense and visually rich summer blockbuster rather than just another daft and forgettable special-effects extravaganza. HBP was a huge step in the right direction, even though I felt that the film's major shortcoming was in its inability to render palpable performances from the younger cast. This was probably due to Yates's orders from producers to go in a more ""romcom"" direction to compete with the uncomparable and lesser Twilight. It was obvious Yates's strong suit was in directing dramatic scenes, not tender, romantic ones.  Regardless, the film delivered and payed respect to the overall spririt of Rowling's work.However, now, in Deathly Hallows, Yates delivers in more ways than one. For one thing, he creates a film that does not feel like any of its predecessors: it is dark, gritty, and intense. The characters are no longer in the safe haven that is Hogwarts, they are on the run and keeping out of sight from the evil Lord Voldemort and his loyal minions. In the process, they have to find objects containing pieces of Voldemort's soul and destroy them; but they have no one to guide them and only the late Dumbledore's hunch to direct their journey. Many critics and audiences alike complained that the film began very well (showcasing an intense action sequence where an army of Death Eaters chase after Harry and his friends in flight), but then began to drag toward the second act. I completely disagree. If you call allowing a movie time for some breathing room, dragging, then our society really has lost its ability to engage in meaningful entertainment. The second act of the film, though slow-paced, showcases not only the acting talents of the main trio, but also demonstrates how strong their friendship is. No other Harry Potter film has had sufficient time to explore these relationships and character dynamics. Yates even allows room for sexual tension to build up between Harry and Hermione, which adds a unique layer to this movie, and gives audiences a lot to speculate about.Technically, like Half-Blood Prince, Deathly Hallows Part 1 delivers. I am surprised it did not at least get nominated for Best Cinematography. Eduardo Serra's ability to measure the camerawork so that it is shaky enough when it needs to be yet subtle when it is essential, is unparalleled; and Yates's decision to work with Serra makes me respect him even more, because it is obvious Yates is an experimental filmmaker, and he will work with a crew that will help present a vision that is true to the source material. Each of his HP adaptations have had a uniformity in their own right, and each one seems so different. Even technically, there are major differences between Ootp, HBP, and DH Part 1. Just observe the color palettes, the cinematography, the art direction, and the framing. DH is so great because Yates has realized that Rowling's story is about young adults who understand the pangs and experiences of any of us muggles. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are not caricatures of real people; they represent real people, exhibiting emotions that are universal. As a result, the visual style of DH Part 1 is very gritty and immersive, allowing us--the audience--to observe the magical, relevant, and relatable themes occuring on the screen, presented in a way in that the magical world of Harry Potter seems not so different from our own.",5,"Not only the best Harry Potter film in the franchise, but also a perfect example of smart young adult

Wilson ""Atheen""","[5, 17]","I really enjoyed not only the stories in the Harry Potter series but also the great talent and forethought that went into creating them.  Each book speaks to a different age group in terms it can understand and does so in a vocabulary that stretches the growing reader without boring the mature reader to death.  Syntax gradually becomes more complex with each book, and the social issues faced at each age are presented realistically if not in the context of reality.  The plot structure is respected, with a beginning, middle and end that show continuity and respect for the reader.  Up until now, each of the films has also respected the story teller's art and the fictional work itself.  By these criteria, however, this installment of the film series is a dismal failure.The public relations for the film suggest that two parts were ""required"" to adequately present the book, but I disagree.  Two parts were necessary to adequately squeeze every last possible penny out of the franchise, and it is painfully obvious.  Part of the film maker's job is to translate the words and pages and the narrative episodes of a written work into a visual work that captures the story in a meaningful way, keeping the story on track by editing episodes where appropriate.  That doesn't seem to have happened here.  What we have is a meaningless bridge from the previous story to the d&eacute;nouement, a bridge we really didn't need and one that seems purposeless. The viewer ends up feeling like he took one of the stairways at Hogwarts, and it redirected him to a floor he hadn't intended on going to!The present film is more of a picture piece than a work of fiction.  Those who enjoy glorious filmography and natural settings will be pleased with the work, as it is definitely eye candy in this respect.  CGI buffs will also receive what they have come to expect by way of special effects in this series.  Those who have come to expect the drama of growing up into adulthood will be very disappointed.  The adult responsibilities and relationships, the personal losses, and the expectations of individuals against the grander background of world events that the final book portrays is somewhat lacking here.  There's a big build up, but nothing really happens that needs to have been enlarged on to the extent of a full 2  hour film.The young people have started on their search for the parts of Voldamort's soul stashed in various objects, but most of the film has them ""camping out"" in lovely locations while trying to come to some plan of action.  Quarrels ensue, separations result, true camaraderie wins out and everyone comes together again, but other than that, not very much happens that forwards the story.  We've already seen the tiny tent with the capacious interior, of which Hermione's purse is just another version.  We've already gotten used to the concept of invisibility; we know that magic can be deadly and wicked people do wicked things.  The story has no beginning, middle or end.  The film just seems to mark time.Anyone collecting the films will hardly miss this one if they choose to have only the second part.",3,Disappointng,1293408000,"12 27, 2010",2010,3129,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'not', 'only', 'stories', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'series', 'also', 'great', 'talent', 'forethought', 'went', 'creating', 'book', 'different', 'age', 'group', 'terms', 'can', 'understand', 'so', 'vocabulary', 'growing', 'reader', 'boring', 'mature', 'reader', 'death', 'Syntax', 'gradually', 'more', 'complex', 'book', 'social', 'issues', 'faced', 'age', 'are', 'presented', 'realistically', 'not', 'context', 'reality', 'plot', 'structure', 'respected', 'beginning', 'middle', 'end', 'show', 'continuity', 'respect', 'reader', 'now', 'films', 'also', 'respected', 'story', 'teller', 'art', 'fictional', 'work', 'criteria', 'however', 'installment', 'film', 'series', 'dismal', 'failure.The', 'public', 'relations', 'film', 'suggest', 'two', 'parts', 'were', 'required', 'adequately', 'present', 'book', 'disagree', 'Two', 'parts', 'were', 'necessary', 'adequately', 'squeeze', 'last', 'possible', 'penny', 'franchise', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'Part', 'film', 'maker', 'job', 'translate', 'words', 'pages', 'narrative', 'episodes', 'written', 'work', 'visual', 'work', 'story', 'meaningful', 'way', 'keeping', 'story', 'track', 'editing', 'episodes', 'where', 'appropriate', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'happened', 'here', 'What', 'have', 'meaningless', 'bridge', 'previous', 'story', 'd', 'eacute', 'nouement', 'bridge', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'one', 'purposeless', 'viewer', 'up', 'feeling', 'took', 'one', 'stairways', 'Hogwarts', 'redirected', 'floor', 'had', ""n't"", 'intended', 'going', 'present', 'film', 'more', 'picture', 'piece', 'work', 'fiction', 'who', 'enjoy', 'glorious', 'filmography', 'natural', 'settings', 'will', 'be', 'pleased', 'work', 'definitely', 'eye', 'candy', 'respect', 'CGI', 'buffs', 'will', 'also', 'receive', 'what', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'way', 'special', 'effects', 'series', 'who', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'drama', 'growing', 'up', 'adulthood', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'disappointed', 'adult', 'responsibilities', 'relationships', 'personal', 'losses', 'expectations', 'individuals', 'grander', 'background', 'world', 'events', 'final', 'book', 'portrays', 'somewhat', 'lacking', 'here', 'big', 'build', 'up', 'nothing', 'really', 'needs', 'have', 'been', 'enlarged', 'extent', 'full', '2', 'hour', 'film.The', 'young', 'people', 'have', 'started', 'search', 'parts', 'Voldamort', 'soul', 'stashed', 'various', 'objects', 'most', 'film', 'camping', 'out', 'lovely', 'locations', 'trying', 'come', 'plan', 'action', 'Quarrels', 'ensue', 'separations', 'result', 'true', 'camaraderie', 'out', 'everyone', 'together', 'again', 'other', 'not', 'very', 'much', 'forwards', 'story', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'tiny', 'tent', 'capacious', 'interior', 'Hermione', 'purse', 'just', 'version', ""'ve"", 'already', 'gotten', 'used', 'concept', 'invisibility', 'know', 'magic', 'can', 'be', 'deadly', 'wicked', 'people', 'do', 'wicked', 'things', 'story', 'beginning', 'end', 'film', 'just', 'mark', 'time.Anyone', 'collecting', 'films', 'will', 'hardly', 'miss', 'one', 'choose', 'have', 'only', 'second', 'part']",N/A

But I'd waited long enough already, so when Amazon offered a pre-release reservation, I ordered it.It may be discounted because this one did not do quite so well at the box office as the earlier films. It's dark, in both senses of the word. But then more people died in ""Half-Blood Prince"" than in this one. Still, the good guys are really up against it now, since the Death Eaters have taken over the Ministry of Magic. Harry, Ron & Hermione don't even try to go to Hogwarts for what would have been their senior year. They have far more important work: finding and destroying the rest of the Horcruxes that will strip Voldemort of his immortality and allow Harry to kill him. In effect, he is killing one part of Voldemort every time he destroys a horcrux. But it's not easy to find them, and not easy to destroy them.The Deathly Hallows are three magical objects mentioned in ""Tales of Beedle the Bard,"" and I have a copy of that book. They include a wand which is more powerful than any other, the ""Elder Wand,"" which is suffused with dark magic. It is stolen from the former owner by killing him. There is a stone which can bring the dead back to life, but they are not happy being zombies and it goes badly. Finally, there is a cloak of invisibility. In the story, that's the only one that worked out well.Since this movie is just half of the last book, I wondered where they'd cut it off. I won't do a spoiler, but just say it was a good choice. However, I am now inspired to go back and read the book again, and get a better sense of what was changed and what was left out.

It is, by no means, a ""children's"" story but one of the most wonderful literary works ever written, with some of the best character development, moral lessons and meaningful themes found in fiction. For this reason, Harry Potter has attracted and continues to attract millions of fans of all ages, genders and nationalities. Deathly Hallows is no exception; it has always been my favorite book in the HP series and is now one of my favorite movies. Period.Unlike the previous film installments in the series, Deathly Hallows-Part 1 provides an exploration of characters, as well as an emotional build-up to the conclusion; it stands in a league of its own. Everything from the cinematography to the soundtrack is well done and quite true to the book. For me, it's a complete transformation--one that makes me feel like I'm watching a movie that's part of a different series altogether.I have read several reviews of Deathly Hallows here and on other sites. Though most are quite favorable, there are a few that criticize different aspects of the movie. Though I can understand certain people disliking the plot or pacing, I completely disagree about the criticisms about the performances.  In my opinion, the trio's acting, particularly that of Rupert Grint, was excellent.  There are specific scenes such as the fight in the tent, the destruction of the Horcrux, Ron's return speech and Malfoy Manor that are spot-on.

E Jackson,"[0, 0]","I wasn't a fan of the previous Harry Potter film because it was extremely shy on the actual magic and didn't contain enough action for my liking, but Deathly Hallows is a pretty remarkable improvement on *both* accounts.  To me the magical aspect of the Harry Potter series is a vital addition to the storytelling.  It really enhances the feeling of adventure.  I'm happy to report that it's back again, thankfully.As expected by the title of the film alone, it's about Lord Voldemort attempting to officially capture and rid the world of Harry Potter once and for all.  Will he succeed?  That's definitely not for me to spoil, hehe.The setting is quite the surprise as well.  Harry Potter and his friends almost never step foot inside a castle which makes the movie feel different, but not in a distracting kind of way or anything.  Most of the adventure takes places outside in the empty forests or occasionally in the city streets.  A major part of the storyline is on Harry Potter and the gang being cloned into lookalike Harry Potter's and being able to disappear whenever signs of danger present themselves (which is pretty much the norm by this point but used to great effect this time around).Some of my favorite scenes are when Harry Potter was outside in the dark woods by himself and he spots a glowing, mystical deer walking around.  To me this was a *beautiful* moment of creativity.  Another really fascinating and bizarre moment of viewing material (and storytelling for that matter) came later when the story surrounding Death takes place and how Death tricks people into being loyal through conniving ways.  It's actually a very interesting story and even someone like me who normally daydreams through such moments was paying close attention and enjoying it.  Good writing.Overall, great acting by all the characters like always, beautiful sceneries, magical superpowers dominate, good suspense and storyline development come together to create an entertaining chapter in the Harry Potter films.",5,now THIS is more like it!,1318118400,"10 9, 2011",2011,2013,"['was', ""n't"", 'fan', 'previous', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'film', 'was', 'extremely', 'shy', 'actual', 'magic', 'did', ""n't"", 'contain', 'enough', 'action', 'liking', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'pretty', 'remarkable', 'improvement', '*both*', 'accounts', 'magical', 'aspect', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'series', 'vital', 'addition', 'storytelling', 'really', 'feeling', 'adventure', ""'m"", 'happy', 'report', 'back', 'again', 'thankfully.As', 'expected', 'title', 'film', 'alone', 'Lord', 'Voldemort', 'attempting', 'officially', 'capture', 'rid', 'world', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'once', 'Will', 'succeed', 'definitely', 'not', 'spoil', 'hehe.The', 'setting', 'quite', 'surprise', 'as', 'well', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'friends', 'almost', 'never', 'step', 'foot', 'castle', 'movie', 'feel', 'different', 'not', 'distracting', 'kind', 'way', 'anything', 'Most', 'adventure', 'places', 'outside', 'empty', 'forests', 'occasionally', 'city', 'streets', 'major', 'part', 'storyline', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'gang', 'being', 'cloned', 'lookalike', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'being', 'able', 'disappear', 'whenever', 'signs', 'danger', 'present', 'pretty', 'much', 'norm', 'point', 'used', 'great', 'effect', 'time', 'around', '.Some', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'are', 'when', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'was', 'outside', 'dark', 'woods', 'glowing', 'mystical', 'deer', 'walking', 'around', 'was', '*beautiful*', 'moment', 'creativity', 'really', 'fascinating', 'bizarre', 'moment', 'viewing', 'material', 'storytelling', 'matter', 'came', 'later', 'when', 'story', 'surrounding', 'Death', 'place', 'how', 'Death', 'people', 'being', 'loyal', 'conniving', 'ways', 'actually', 'very', 'interesting', 'story', 'even', 'someone', 'who', 'normally', 'daydreams', 'such', 'moments', 'was', 'paying', 'close', 'attention', 'enjoying', 'Good', 'writing.Overall', 'great', 'acting', 'characters', 'always', 'beautiful', 'sceneries', 'magical', 'superpowers', 'dominate', 'good', 'suspense', 'storyline', 'development', 'come', 'together', 'create', 'entertaining', 'chapter', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'films']",N/A

I disagree, but understand exactly why he thinks this way. As anyone who has read the book knows, a large part of the seventh book is buildup towards the definite battle that awaits. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows Pt. 1 is just buildup.If you have read the book, you will enjoy this film as it is faithful to the spirit of the book; if you know Harry simply through the films, you might be disappointed. For it is filmed with camping in deserted locations, forests, and other odd locations to escape from Voldermort's grasp. This is really why some critics absolutely hate this film as they can not fathom the amount of buildup this film does. However, if they want to criticize anyone, they should critique Rowling as this is a faithful adaption of her book.Radcliffe and Grint are great as always, but the welcome surprise is Emma Watson whose acting has gotten better and better, and she reaches a new peak. She balances each relationship very decisively , putting different emotional layers in treating Harry and Ron.  In addition, the landscapes are as gorgeous as ever, and the special effects have become surprisingly better-especially Voldermort's snake which sent chills through my spine.The emotion the film induces does something that the book never did for me. It takes it out of this magical world, and into the real world, and makes the evil present in Harry's World seem like the fear many people battling evil might have felt in Germany, during the 1930's and forties. Hermione's attempt to save her parents from the hands of evil give us another view in this world which almost mirrors us in terms of what these people go through to wipe this evil horror.The deathly Hollows may be a boring film for those unfamiliar with the book, but for the readers of this tale it is the most faithfully done adaptation. Sure, the film does not succeed on a film lover's point of view, but one must remember any disappointment felt with this film will evaporate with the menacing, blood spilling second part.",5,A necessary and fitting buildup to a hopefully grand conclusion,1290124800,"11 19, 2010",2010,2153,"['Walking', 'screeing', 'one', 'friends', 'remarked', 'hated', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'film', 'stating', 'worst', 'series', 'disagree', 'understand', 'exactly', 'why', 'way', 'anyone', 'who', 'read', 'book', 'large', 'part', 'seventh', 'book', 'buildup', 'definite', 'battle', 'awaits', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Deathly', 'Hollows', 'Pt', '1', 'just', 'buildup.If', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'faithful', 'spirit', 'book', 'know', 'Harry', 'simply', 'films', 'might', 'be', 'disappointed', 'filmed', 'camping', 'deserted', 'locations', 'forests', 'other', 'odd', 'locations', 'escape', 'Voldermort', 'grasp', 'really', 'why', 'critics', 'absolutely', 'hate', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'fathom', 'amount', 'buildup', 'film', 'However', 'want', 'criticize', 'anyone', 'should', 'critique', 'Rowling', 'faithful', 'adaption', 'book.Radcliffe', 'Grint', 'are', 'great', 'always', 'welcome', 'surprise', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'acting', 'gotten', 'better', 'better', 'new', 'peak', 'relationship', 'very', 'decisively', 'putting', 'different', 'emotional', 'layers', 'treating', 'Harry', 'Ron', 'addition', 'landscapes', 'are', 'as', 'gorgeous', 'ever', 'special', 'effects', 'have', 'become', 'surprisingly', 'better-especially', 'Voldermort', 'snake', 'sent', 'chills', 'spine.The', 'emotion', 'film', 'induces', 'something', 'book', 'never', 'did', 'magical', 'world', 'real', 'world', 'evil', 'present', 'Harry', 'World', 'seem', 'fear', 'many', 'people', 'battling', 'evil', 'might', 'have', 'felt', 'Germany', '1930', 'forties', 'Hermione', 'attempt', 'save', 'parents', 'hands', 'evil', 'give', 'view', 'world', 'almost', 'mirrors', 'terms', 'what', 'people', 'go', 'wipe', 'evil', 'horror.The', 'deathly', 'Hollows', 'may', 'be', 'boring', 'film', 'unfamiliar', 'book', 'readers', 'tale', 'most', 'faithfully', 'done', 'adaptation', 'Sure', 'film', 'not', 'succeed', 'film', 'lover', 'point', 'view', 'one', 'must', 'remember', 'disappointment', 'felt', 'film', 'will', 'evaporate', 'menacing', 'blood', 'spilling', 'second', 'part']",N/A

Harry's problems with his aunt, uncle, and cousin were played for laughs. Classroom scenes were at time frustrating, and at times funny, but always interesting.At some point in this process JK Rowling lost the wonder of her early books, and began to see herself as a SERIOUS WRITER OF DRAMA. At that point all the fun drained out of her stories. I have finished them merely to finish them, not because I really had fun with the last books, or these last three movies. DH Part 1 is a lot like ""The Dark Knight"" in that the movie is expertly crafted, but just gives the viewer very little hang onto in terms of tension breaks. I think this is a big mistake for any movie. The goal of a movie such as this should be to entertain the audience, not exhaust them. I'll have no problem re-watching the first five movies at times, but I seriously doubt there will be ANY repeat viewings of the final three movies for me. Just as even though I'm a big time Batman fan, I've had absolutely no desire to watch ""The Dark Knight"" a second time. Unrelenting tension and misery for the main characters isn't my thing. I get enough of that just running a business. LOLSo if you have read all the books and watched the first six films, certainly there is no way you are going to miss this one, or the conclusion. You have too much invested in the story over the years, just as we do. You will be impressed at the special effects, which are so natural to this vision of a magical society by now that you will forget that they ARE special effects. You'll be uplifted at our heroes' little victories, and sad at the tragedies which befall them. If you're like me, in the end you may also feel a bit empty, because the charm and joy which the first books and movies in this series promised is long gone by the stark and depressing tone of its ending.",4,"Expertly brought to the screen, but very dark.",1310947200,"07 18, 2011",2011,2321,"['When', 'say', 'film', 'dark', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'visual', 'presentation', 'superb', 'cinematography', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'much', 'Half', 'Blood', 'Prince', 'DH', 'Part', '1', 'very', 'little', 'delight', 'joy', 'were', 'evident', 'early', 'books', 'movies', 'Yes', 'stories', 'had', 'dark', 'elements', 'associated', 'Voldemort', 'dangerous', 'seeming', 'climaxes', 'other', 'parts', 'stories', 'were', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'uplifting', 'depiction', 'life', 'Hogwarts', 'Harry', 'problems', 'aunt', 'uncle', 'cousin', 'were', 'played', 'laughs', 'Classroom', 'scenes', 'were', 'time', 'frustrating', 'times', 'funny', 'always', 'interesting.At', 'point', 'process', 'JK', 'Rowling', 'lost', 'wonder', 'early', 'books', 'began', 'see', 'SERIOUS', 'WRITER', 'OF', 'DRAMA', 'point', 'fun', 'drained', 'stories', 'have', 'finished', 'merely', 'finish', 'not', 'really', 'had', 'fun', 'last', 'books', 'last', 'three', 'movies', 'DH', 'Part', '1', 'lot', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'movie', 'expertly', 'crafted', 'just', 'viewer', 'very', 'little', 'hang', 'terms', 'tension', 'breaks', 'think', 'big', 'mistake', 'movie', 'goal', 'movie', 'such', 'should', 'be', 'entertain', 'audience', 'not', 'exhaust', ""'ll"", 'have', 'problem', 're-watching', 'first', 'five', 'movies', 'times', 'seriously', 'doubt', 'will', 'be', 'ANY', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'final', 'three', 'movies', 'Just', 'even', ""'m"", 'big', 'time', 'Batman', 'fan', ""'ve"", 'had', 'absolutely', 'desire', 'watch', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'second', 'time', 'Unrelenting', 'tension', 'misery', 'main', 'characters', ""n't"", 'thing', 'get', 'enough', 'just', 'running', 'business', 'LOLSo', 'have', 'read', 'books', 'watched', 'first', 'six', 'films', 'certainly', 'way', 'are', 'going', 'miss', 'one', 'conclusion', 'have', 'too', 'much', 'invested', 'story', 'years', 'just', 'do', 'will', 'be', 'impressed', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'so', 'natural', 'vision', 'magical', 'society', 'now', 'will', 'forget', 'ARE', 'special', 'effects', ""'ll"", 'be', 'uplifted', 'heroes', 'little', 'victories', 'sad', 'tragedies', 'befall', ""'re"", 'end', 'may', 'also', 'feel', 'bit', 'empty', 'charm', 'joy', 'first', 'books', 'movies', 'series', 'promised', 'long', 'gone', 'stark', 'depressing', 'tone', 'ending']",N/A

Its a shame we have to come back for Part 2 (and buy it, lol) but so far, judging from this movie its well worth it. Plus, for once the book readers and the only-movie watchers are semi-satisfied. That's sort of a guarantee. Things are missing, things are modified to make them ""cooler"" but it works.Hollywood has to change things like they intend to with the next movie and Snape's scene, but that so that the same feelings we felt from reading the book can be felt in a movie. You can't translate things exactly the same from book to screen and make people understand and believe and feel it.This movie is well worth the leap of faith.The kids are out of Hogwarts now, and while that could have backfired on them, it worked really well. Everything really worked really well. They are much more experienced actors and it shows. The trio in particular are completely fabulous in this one.I'll be buying this version, on blue-ray, merely because it was THAT good. I've been a fan of Harry Potter for roughly eleven years now, and I was not at all disappointed. Ended up watching this movie twice in theaters, which I have never done.The effects are not cheesy, even the ""shield"" or ""protection"" magics, and its pretty clear to anyone; it doesn't skip too many things that the ""only-movie watchers"" need to know. Did I have to explain a few things to the guy next to me that kept taking me away from the movie? Sure.

There is an added wrinkle they learn though when they hear the story of the Deadly Hallows from Luna's father and Hermione.  This added wrinkle is told visually with what may be puppets and is the most visually arresting part of the movie.  Whoever did this sequence did an incredible job.  It is a fabulous piece of art and storytelling.Lord Voldemort as played by Ralph Fienne is absolutely magnificent.  Every time he is onscreen, the story is just wonderful. The makeup and prostheses used on him also recreate the oddly disfigured creature he became when he returned to the world.If the second part is extremely well done, then the two parts, when viewed together, may end up being a 5 star experience.

1240640,A1M39P7MO277FV,B001UV4XHY,Chinmay Hota,"[5, 7]","For the Harry Potter fandom the wait for a new movie has been quite rewarding. Deathly Hallows Part I, has very successfully built up the suspense and the curiosity of the myriad of Potter fans, who will now wait restlessly for the final climax of the series. Followers of Harry Potter and his two friends, who have grown up simultaneously with the fictional trio, would have found the confusions, frustrations and rage of the stormy teenage years very familiar. The plot deals with a lot of real emotions, the emotions and aches of growing up, of being challenged. There is jealousy, anger and empathy--these human emotions mark a departure of Deathly from the bravado and mindless adventures of the earlier Potter flicks.Harry, Ron and Hermione escape from the numerous attacks of the Death Eaters, let loose by Voldemort. The killing mission includes a high adrenalin chase of Harry and his seven look-alikes by the blood thirsty gang, which is a high point of the movie, visually. Potter and friends escape into the wilderness, but the Death Eaters' attacks never come to an end, and their goons capture and take them to the lair.The trio escapes from the dungeon with the help of elf Dobby who pays with his life in the effort to release them. Dobby's death in the lap of Harry Potter brings about the most poignant scene in the movie. Now Harry and friends come to learn about the Deathly Hallows, based on some symbols and their intuitions. Hermione's reading of the story about the seven deathly hallows is accompanied by a symbolic enactment, which is very captivating and will remain deeply etched in the viewer's mind for long.While the development of the plot is very intelligent and flawless, there are certain issues about the pace of the movie. Some parts drag, especially the lengthy discussions and deliberations. The many ifs and buts during the unfolding of the plot frustrate the viewer, used to the fast pace of the childhood adventure and games of the earlier movies. Most of the action takes place in the outside world, away from the all too familiar school premises. That's a welcome change.Finally the fights and misunderstandings between Harry and Ron depict the coming of age of the chums.The die-hard fans will surely revel in the movie despite the fact the director David Yates has taken a lot of liberty about his selection of which part of the book to include in the movie and which to leave out.  For the uninitiated, though, this random and non-linear selection may appear quite disjointed and confusing.Chinmay HotaAuthor of 'Hits and Misses'",5,A Memorable One For the Loyal Fan,1292803200,"12 20, 2010",2010,2576,"['Harry', 'Potter', 'fandom', 'wait', 'new', 'movie', 'been', 'quite', 'rewarding', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'Part', 'very', 'successfully', 'built', 'up', 'suspense', 'curiosity', 'myriad', 'Potter', 'fans', 'who', 'will', 'now', 'wait', 'restlessly', 'final', 'climax', 'series', 'Followers', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'two', 'friends', 'who', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'simultaneously', 'fictional', 'trio', 'would', 'have', 'found', 'confusions', 'frustrations', 'rage', 'stormy', 'teenage', 'years', 'very', 'familiar', 'plot', 'deals', 'lot', 'real', 'emotions', 'emotions', 'aches', 'growing', 'up', 'being', 'challenged', 'jealousy', 'anger', 'empathy', 'human', 'emotions', 'mark', 'departure', 'Deathly', 'bravado', 'mindless', 'adventures', 'earlier', 'Potter', 'flicks.Harry', 'Ron', 'Hermione', 'escape', 'numerous', 'attacks', 'Death', 'Eaters', 'let', 'loose', 'Voldemort', 'killing', 'mission', 'high', 'adrenalin', 'chase', 'Harry', 'seven', 'look-alikes', 'blood', 'thirsty', 'gang', 'high', 'point', 'movie', 'visually', 'Potter', 'escape', 'wilderness', 'Death', 'Eaters', 'attacks', 'never', 'come', 'end', 'goons', 'capture', 'take', 'lair.The', 'trio', 'dungeon', 'help', 'elf', 'Dobby', 'who', 'life', 'effort', 'release', 'Dobby', 'death', 'lap', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'most', 'poignant', 'scene', 'movie', 'Now', 'Harry', 'come', 'learn', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'based', 'symbols', 'intuitions', 'Hermione', 'reading', 'story', 'seven', 'deathly', 'hallows', 'accompanied', 'symbolic', 'enactment', 'very', 'captivating', 'will', 'remain', 'deeply', 'etched', 'viewer', 'mind', 'development', 'plot', 'very', 'intelligent', 'flawless', 'are', 'certain', 'issues', 'pace', 'movie', 'parts', 'drag', 'especially', 'lengthy', 'discussions', 'deliberations', 'many', 'ifs', 'buts', 'unfolding', 'plot', 'frustrate', 'viewer', 'used', 'fast', 'pace', 'childhood', 'adventure', 'games', 'earlier', 'movies', 'Most', 'action', 'place', 'outside', 'world', 'away', 'too', 'familiar', 'school', 'premises', 'welcome', 'change.Finally', 'fights', 'misunderstandings', 'Harry', 'Ron', 'depict', 'coming', 'age', 'chums.The', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'will', 'surely', 'revel', 'movie', 'fact', 'director', 'David', 'Yates', 'taken', 'lot', 'liberty', 'selection', 'part', 'book', 'include', 'movie', 'leave', 'out', 'uninitiated', 'though', 'random', 'non-linear', 'selection', 'may', 'appear', 'quite', 'disjointed', 'confusing.Chinmay', 'HotaAuthor', ""'Hits"", 'Misses']",N/A

Throughout the entire series, there has been one central theme: Boy learns magic and comes closer to his destiny to face off against evil. Did it take 8 movies to get there? Not to say that I didn't enjoy all of the movies, HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 1, really hammers this point home for me as it ends dramatically and quite ceremoniously as if to say.... ""Come back again folks. Thanks for your cash."" This was just one more TEASER film building up to the payoff.I enjoy the HARRY POTTER movies. Don't get me wrong. Yet, it's like a bunch of movies centered around subplots building up to what is finally coming next in HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 2. Resolution. Finale. I don't know if I want to say, ""Thank God."" or wish there were more movies coming. I think it's ""Thank God.""HARRY POTTER is the STAR WARS of this era, and I think they had more tact and circumstance then the STAR WARS series had, but both series made entire movies out of less than important story lines.DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 1 is an okay movie in a series of good movies that are meandering and sometimes pointless but ultimately entertaining and good. PART 1 spends too much time being dramatic and world ending and hammering on the point that we should be afraid, very afraid. In doing so, it ultimately bores children who have been following the series to death and bores people like me who want the payoff to hurry up and get here for godsakes.DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 2 better not disappoint because we've sat through 7 movies of subplot to get here... sheeesshh.",4,THE LONGEST DRAWN OUT SERIES EVER,1305072000,"05 11, 2011",2011,1673,"['may', 'be', 'giving', 'movie', '4', 'stars', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'glowing', 'review', 'HARRY', 'POTTER', 'one', 'story', 'entire', 'series', 'been', 'one', 'central', 'theme', 'Boy', 'magic', 'closer', 'destiny', 'face', 'off', 'evil', 'Did', 'take', '8', 'movies', 'get', 'there', 'Not', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'movies', 'HARRY', 'POTTER', 'AND', 'THE', 'DEATHLY', 'HALLOWS', 'PART', '1', 'really', 'point', 'home', 'dramatically', 'quite', 'ceremoniously', 'say', 'Come', 'back', 'again', 'folks', 'Thanks', 'cash', 'was', 'just', 'one', 'more', 'TEASER', 'film', 'building', 'up', 'payoff.I', 'HARRY', 'POTTER', 'movies', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'bunch', 'movies', 'centered', 'subplots', 'building', 'up', 'what', 'finally', 'coming', 'next', 'HARRY', 'POTTER', 'AND', 'THE', 'DEATHLY', 'HALLOWS', 'PART', '2', 'Resolution', 'Finale', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'want', 'say', 'Thank', 'God', 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'movies', 'coming', 'think', 'Thank', 'God', 'HARRY', 'POTTER', 'STAR', 'WARS', 'era', 'think', 'had', 'more', 'tact', 'circumstance', 'then', 'STAR', 'WARS', 'series', 'had', 'series', 'made', 'entire', 'movies', 'less', 'important', 'story', 'lines.DEATHLY', 'HALLOWS', 'PART', '1', 'okay', 'movie', 'series', 'good', 'movies', 'are', 'meandering', 'sometimes', 'pointless', 'ultimately', 'entertaining', 'good', 'PART', '1', 'spends', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'being', 'dramatic', 'world', 'ending', 'hammering', 'point', 'should', 'be', 'afraid', 'very', 'afraid', 'doing', 'so', 'ultimately', 'children', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'following', 'series', 'death', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'payoff', 'hurry', 'up', 'get', 'here', 'godsakes.DEATHLY', 'HALLOWS', 'PART', '2', 'better', 'not', 'disappoint', ""'ve"", 'sat', '7', 'movies', 'subplot', 'get', 'here', 'sheeesshh']",N/A
1240642,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001UV4XHY,Chris Pandolfi,"[4, 6]","The decision to split the final of J.K. Rowling's novels into two films was a wise one, for it allows for the inclusion of crucial details that simply couldn't be cut for the sake of time and pacing. This first installment of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is the most faithful adaptation since the original Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. It's also just like all the previous films in that it's spectacular entertainment - provided you don't mind the shadowy, deeply emotional, almost funereal direction the stories have been going in. The depth of character is amazing, in all likelihood because of the film's overwhelming seriousness. The plot is engaging, a mixture of a road film, a scavenger hunt, and a revenge fable. It balances it's solemnity with a healthy dose of magic and, in a few very appropriate places, humor. It's also the first film in the series to end with a cliffhanger, always a welcome addition.Being faithful, of course, does have its drawbacks. The film is not only dependent on the viewer's knowledge of the previous installments, but also on the viewer's willingness to listen. Many, many important things are said by many, many people, and if you're not going to pay attention, you might as well see something else. Fortunately, just about everything is explained at one point or another; this is usually thanks to Hermione Granger, who after seven years is no less of a bookworm. We also have numerous scenes of the three leads piecing things together from little more than sheer speculation, and this is just as it has been since the very first film. What they will discover in Part 2 remains to be seen, but you can rest assured that some of what they thought about certain things will turn out to be incorrect.Part 1 begins exactly where Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince left off. With the magical world in chaos following the untimely death of Albus Dumbledore and a hostile takeover by Lord Volemort and his loathsome cronies, our heroes are forced to make drastic changes. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), now the most wanted wizard in the world, ships his aunt, uncle, and cousin off to a safe location. At Harry's side are his two best friends, Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint). So too are members of the Order of the Phoenix, including Remus Lupin (David Thewlis), Mad-Eye Moody (Brendan Gleeson), and even Hogwarts gamekeeper Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane). It will be hard to keep Harry's location a secret from the snake-faced Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes), since it seems he can easily be traced.A series of terrible events force Harry, Hermione, and Ron to go on the run; they magically transport themselves from one isolated location to another, taking refuge in a special tent that, like Dr. Who's telephone booth, holds more space than its outer dimensions suggest. Their mission: Seek and destroy magical objects called Horcruxes, all of which contain a small piece of Voldemort's soul. Harry thought he had found one at the end of the previous film, but that item - a locket - turned out to be a fake. Finding the real locket will involve an interrogation of a cranky house elf named Kreacher (voiced by Simon McBurney), the kidnapping of a shady wizard named Mundungus Fletcher (Andy Linden), and a carefully planned break-in into the Ministry of Magic, where, in disguise, our three friends will run into their old nemesis, Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton).These and other events are carefully crafted, but they're also expected. Not so expected is the ways in which Harry, Hermione, and Ron are developed. The world as they knew it is gone - no more Quiddich games, no more visits to Hogsmeade, no more classes at Hogwarts. They've abandoned their former lives. In short, they've grown up. Yes, but why did they have grow up in this particular way? Why are Hermione and Ron following Harry when it's obvious he has nothing to go on apart from memories of vague conversations with Dumbledore? Was Dumbledore the great wizard Harry thought him to be, or were there chapters of his life he intentionally never revealed? Our three friends are lost, confused, and weary, stuck on a quest for objects that could literally be anywhere. These include the fabled Deathly Hallows, three magical items symbolized as a line within a circle within a triangle.The Harry Potter films have gone from wonderfully whimsical to delightfully dark to terribly tragic. We've marveled at their heroes, shuddered at their villains, and mourned at the loss of beloved figures. They've ignited our imaginations and beckoned us to follow along with them. Before, I've taken the approach of the giddy fanboy, brimming with excitement and anticipation. In the case of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, I take an approach of resignation and elegy. It's the beginning of the end. I always knew it was coming, but even after the passage of nine years - ten when Part 2 is released next summer - it still feels as if it's coming too soon. This new movie is wonderful, but I will always remember with longing the first time I saw three fresh-faced eleven year olds going on their first magical adventure.",4,It's the Beginning of the

1240645,A1D27BCSYV7VWH,B001UV4XHY,C. James,"[68, 82]","Note: This is not a rating on the movie itself, this is on the Warner Brothers (WB) misleading packaging suggesting the digital copy is included.I got the 3 pack and of course paid extra for it but when it arrived there were 3 DVD's but no digital copy, the 3rd DVD is just special features, of which the digital copy is not one of them.If you look at the cover or product description is says Three-Disc-Combo Blu-ray / DVD Combo + digital copy. Don't know about you but when I see three disc combo, and that description I assumed the three listed on cover and description are actually in the package, it isn't, instead the 3rd disc is the Special Features. I got the TRON combo pack, which said it had a digital copy and it really did...Very misleading in my opinion, but wait, it gets worse.When I went to Download it, you can't even just download the movie, it makes you download a 510MB Installer (bigger than the Windows 7 Installer!). Once you have the installer it just gets worse as it then tries to make you take WB Digital Movie Manager even if you pick the option just for the movie.When I saw all of the junk it wanted to install I aborted out of it. So if you wanted the digital copy without a terabyte of overhead and garbage installed on your computer I would skip this deal and just get the movie without the junk.I like my digital copies on DVD, never saw this scam before, the WB application basically wants to take over your movie collection and report all of your movies back to WB, there are so many things wrong with that idea I will not even start, just say, Warner Brothers must be out of their mind and planning to dupe a bunch of kids. To date this is the most shamefull packaging of a Movie deal I have ever seen.The kicker is that if you do not agree to the totally unreasonable terms you get no digital copy. If I wanted to share the contents of my movie collection with WB I would send them an email with the list, nor will I install an application where I have no control or view in to what it is sending home, it should be illegal to put spyware like that on your system but the agreement makes you give them permission to hunt around on your PC and pass the information back to WB.So sad they pull this on anyone but you know this will end up on tons of PC with unsuspecting users piling more junk on their PC and WB Exclusive spyware. This is a good package to avoid unless you have to have the digital copy of this at any cost.If you opt for the iTunes version and not the Windows version you are not forced to take the WB manager, but you are then stuck with only being able to play it on systems with iTunes.",1,Digital Copy Not Included!!,1302825600,"04 15, 2011",2011,2645,"['Note', 'not', 'rating', 'movie', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'WB', 'misleading', 'packaging', 'suggesting', 'digital', 'copy', 'included.I', 'got', '3', 'pack', 'course', 'paid', 'extra', 'when', 'arrived', 'were', '3', 'DVD', 'digital', 'copy', '3rd', 'DVD', 'just', 'special', 'features', 'digital', 'copy', 'not', 'one', 'them.If', 'look', 'cover', 'product', 'description', 'Three-Disc-Combo', 'Blu-ray', '/', 'DVD', 'Combo', '+', 'digital', 'copy', 'Do', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', 'see', 'three', 'disc', 'combo', 'description', 'assumed', 'three', 'listed', 'cover', 'description', 'are', 'actually', 'package', ""n't"", 'instead', '3rd', 'disc', 'Special', 'Features', 'got', 'TRON', 'combo', 'pack', 'said', 'had', 'digital', 'copy', 'really', 'did', 'Very', 'misleading', 'opinion', 'wait', 'worse.When', 'went', 'Download', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'just', 'download', 'movie', 'download', '510MB', 'Installer', 'bigger', 'Windows', '7', 'Installer', 'Once', 'have', 'installer', 'just', 'worse', 'then', 'make', 'take', 'WB', 'Digital', 'Movie', 'Manager', 'even', 'pick', 'option', 'just', 'movie.When', 'saw', 'junk', 'wanted', 'install', 'aborted', 'So', 'wanted', 'digital', 'copy', 'terabyte', 'overhead', 'garbage', 'installed', 'computer', 'would', 'skip', 'deal', 'just', 'get', 'movie', 'junk.I', 'digital', 'copies', 'DVD', 'never', 'saw', 'scam', 'WB', 'application', 'basically', 'take', 'over', 'movie', 'collection', 'report', 'movies', 'back', 'WB', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'wrong', 'idea', 'will', 'not', 'even', 'start', 'just', 'say', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'must', 'be', 'mind', 'planning', 'dupe', 'bunch', 'kids', 'date', 'most', 'shamefull', 'packaging', 'Movie', 'deal', 'have', 'ever', 'seen.The', 'kicker', 'do', 'not', 'agree', 'totally', 'unreasonable', 'terms', 'get', 'digital', 'copy', 'wanted', 'share', 'contents', 'movie', 'collection', 'WB', 'would', 'send', 'email', 'list', 'will', 'install', 'application', 'where', 'have', 'control', 'view', 'what', 'sending', 'home', 'should', 'be', 'illegal', 'put', 'spyware', 'system', 'agreement', 'give', 'permission', 'hunt', 'around', 'PC', 'pass', 'information', 'back', 'WB.So', 'sad', 'pull', 'anyone', 'know', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'tons', 'PC', 'unsuspecting', 'users', 'piling', 'more', 'junk', 'PC', 'WB', 'Exclusive', 'spyware', 'good', 'package', 'avoid', 'have', 'have', 'digital', 'copy', 'cost.If', 'opt', 'iTunes', 'version', 'not', 'Windows', 'version', 'are', 'not', 'forced', 'take', 'WB', 'manager', 'are', 'then', 'stuck', 'only', 'being', 'able', 'play', 'systems', 'iTunes']",N/A

1240647,ACJVGDN8G386P,B001UV4XHY,"classicalsteve ""classicalsteve""","[2, 4]","It's hard to believe we've now been living with Harry Potter for going on 12 years for Americans, and 13 years if you're British since the first book was published in the UK as ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" in 1997 and ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" in the US in 1998. In the first installment of the last book, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part I, the entire Harry Potter enterprise has literally come-of-age. The story and characters have matured along with the writer, her readers/film-goers, as well as the actors in the primary roles. Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, and Daniel Radcliffe in the roles of Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, and Harry Potter have grown up along with their youthful wizards, and the actors themselves are fast-earning the right to be regarded as A-list talent. Hopefully, they will have fine careers ahead of them, assuming they won't be forever type-cast as the Hogwarts wizard students of the Harry Potter novels. And of course, the ultimate credit of the series belongs to J.K. Rowling who has created a universe as recognizable as JRR Tolkien's Middle Earth, Stephen King's Dark Tower, and Anne Rice's 18th and 19th-century vampire societies.The rest of the cast of ""HP and the Deathly Hallows"", aside from the young leads, comprises bona fide A-list actors who were already demonstrating the heights of their craft long before J.K. Rowling was penning Harry Potter in tea shops as a single mother on welfare in Britain. Ironically, the names topping the list play the villains and dark characters: Ralph Fiennes as Lord Voldemort, Alan Rickman as Severus Snape, and Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange. Special recognition has to be paid to Fiennes as Voldemort whose demonic persona makes the likes of Dracula and Frankenstein's monster appear more like bank robbers by comparison. Fiennes, despite the warped face and absent nose, is entirely believable as the sworn enemy of Harry Potter and an adversary to all that is good in the Wizard World.However the crux of the tale (as with the rest of the series), surrounds the three young leads inside an incredible production. The first couple of installments were written more for a younger age group. Now the characters and their respective actors have grown in complexity and subtlety. They reside inside the skins of their characters in ways which make you believe they understand and appreciate them more. No longer the smart class show-off of younger years, Hermione has grown into a young woman beginning to appreciate more fully the powers she has been taught which can transform the world rather than simply being the most-liked by her teachers. Weasley has a better sense of himself and is now dating Hermione which would have been unthinkable in the first few Harry Potter stories. And Harry Potter is nearing the moment when he can face Lord Vortemort as a near-equal without cringing at the sound of the name.The plot of the present installment is the most complex and compelling yet. Voldemort has gained power over the Ministry of Magic who are running the wizard government akin to Nazism of the 1930's. Anyone with ""muggle"" (i.e. non-wizard) blood risks being expelled and/or subdued by high-ranking officials in kangaroo courts. They have even placed a roman-inspired relief in the wizard town square showing muggles being subdued by magic. Although the wizard ministry and government are run by mortal wizards, Lord Voldemort is pulling the puppet strings like a demonic equivalent of the Godfather. He is on the verge of gaining complete immortality through the Horcrux's, amulet artifacts which also have an interesting side-affect of making the wearer become more self-absorbed and selfish, not unlike the Ring of the ""Lord of the Rings"". Dumbledore had begun the mission of destroying the Horcrux's as a means of defeating Voldemort; the mission now is passed onto Harry Potter and his friends. Harry Potter along with allies escort him to a refuge but are immediately besieged by the soulless dementors. There must have been a traitor among them which tipped off Voldemort.The three young wizards then engage in a two-fold quest: to obtain and destroy the Horcrux's to stop Voldemort from permanently gaining immortality thereby becoming the absolute-ruler of the Wizard World for eternity. Think of Adolph Hitler wielding a wand. Unfortunately, the Horcrux's appear indestructible, and they must obtain an artifact willed to Potter from the late Dumbledore, a sword, Godric Gryffindor, which Hermione realizes may contain enough power to destroy the Horcrux. During their quest, they keep stumbling upon a strange triangular symbol, which even appears on one of the stones of a cemetery at Harry Potter's birthplace which is also his parents' deathplace.A brilliant and compelling film all the way around despite having been absent from Hogwarts, with absolutely phenomenal effects which neither impedes the story nor hinders the acting but enhances the Wizard World and the story contained within. The acting is some of the best I have seen for a fantasy film/story, it's only rival Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"". The best which can said of this film is that it never appears like the filmmakers were relying solely on the Harry Potter name for success. They have forged a brilliant film to climax the series, one of the best all-time in fantasy-filmmaking.",5,HP Films Keep Ascending the Magical Ladder of Storytellng Classics: Most Mature Harry Potter

It consists of Harry, Ron & Hermione walking from one point to the next, looking for and destroying one Horcrux while camping out in a tent.

I try to watch the films every now and then to see if I can get a handle on what all the fuss is about. It still eludes me. I was bored through this movie, with one scene standing out as engaging and interesting and having some magic, some sparkle. Obviously, mine is not the majority view.I find Daniel Radcliffe frighteningly cute. He's just a child! Scary. The scene where several Harrys remove their shirts at once - wow. Hand me my fan.Ralph Fiennes is one of the all-time great film actors. He does evil very well - see ""Schindler's List."" Here he is wearing some kind of CGI no-nose Halloween mask and he doesn't raise so much as one goose pimple. Fiennes could have made this villain, Voldemort, really scary if they had removed the silly make-up/cgi. As it is, you look at him and think, poor guy, some kind of no-nose birth defect. It would be unkind to stare. Hire the differently abled!I had no idea what was going on for most of the movie. I'd read a review saying that Hermione had to erase her family's memories of her, and that that was very poignant. That happens in an opening scene that lasts about a minute. Had I not read the review, I would have had no idea what was happening. Whatever was happening was not poignant to this viewer.I didn't, and still don't, know what a horcrux is. Characters have magical powers, but which characters have which powers? Voldemort wants to kill Harry; Voldemort has magical powers. Why doesn't Voldemort just use his magical powers to kill Harry? What's preventing him? I have no idea, because I don't know how magical powers are apportioned, or resisted, in this world. There's scene after scene of wands and chases and searches and I never knew what anyone could do with what spell or wand, so I didn't know what was at stake and what needed to be done to protect what was at stake. At one point Ron tells Harry ""It's about more than you."" What is it about? Box office revenue.There's a scene where Harry is caught under ice, alone in a forest at night: a real claustrophobe's paranoid nightmare. I found I could watch the scene without any anxiety. Now that's poor filmmaking.There is so much stuff slathered onscreen: eccentric English cottages with floating pears growing outside the front door, magical tents, protective snowy owls, elevators that travel sideways - and I never once said ""Oooo"" or ""Aaaa"" (except for that scene where multiple Harrys bear multiple post-adolescent, nicely muscled, newly hairy chests - ooo baby). Nothing felt magical to me. The ever present onscreen junk all had the same, loud, tacky, K-Mart Christmas feel. ""Less is more"" anyone?There was one scene that worked. I was caught up in it, and, even as I was watching it, I imagined legions of fangirls watching this scene again and again once the home version is released. Harry and Hermione are feeling low. They are alone in a tent in a forest. Music is playing on a staticky radio. The camera focuses on Hermione in the glow of a kerosene lamp. Suddenly, the view of Hermione is blocked by Harry's sweater-clad shoulder. In the same way that he is blocking the scene, he is overwhelming Hermione's consciousness. He extends his hand to her; she rises; they dance, their bodies directed by their despair, their hunger for intimacy with each other, and their fear that satisfying that desire is not a wise idea. It's a truly magical scene, and all too brief. And it required no special effects, just young people you care about who are trying to thrive, as all of us do, through contact, music, art, and dance, in a life-or-death situation.",2,One Magic Scene,1290297600,"11 21, 2010",2010,3639,"['am', 'immune', 'appeal', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'phenom', 'try', 'watch', 'films', 'now', 'then', 'see', 'can', 'get', 'handle', 'what', 'fuss', 'about', 'still', 'was', 'bored', 'movie', 'one', 'scene', 'standing', 'out', 'engaging', 'interesting', 'having', 'magic', 'sparkle', 'Obviously', 'mine', 'not', 'majority', 'view.I', 'find', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'frighteningly', 'cute', 'just', 'child', 'Scary', 'scene', 'where', 'several', 'Harrys', 'remove', 'shirts', 'once', 'wow', 'Hand', 'fan.Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'one', 'all-time', 'great', 'film', 'actors', 'evil', 'very', 'well', 'see', 'Schindler', 'List', 'Here', 'wearing', 'kind', 'CGI', 'no-nose', 'Halloween', 'mask', ""n't"", 'raise', 'so', 'much', 'one', 'goose', 'pimple', 'Fiennes', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'villain', 'Voldemort', 'really', 'scary', 'had', 'removed', 'silly', 'make-up/cgi', 'look', 'think', 'poor', 'guy', 'kind', 'no-nose', 'birth', 'defect', 'would', 'be', 'unkind', 'stare', 'Hire', 'differently', 'abled', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'most', 'movie', ""'d"", 'read', 'review', 'saying', 'Hermione', 'had', 'erase', 'family', 'memories', 'was', 'very', 'poignant', 'opening', 'scene', 'minute', 'Had', 'not', 'read', 'review', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'was', 'happening', 'was', 'not', 'poignant', 'viewer.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'horcrux', 'Characters', 'have', 'magical', 'powers', 'characters', 'have', 'powers', 'Voldemort', 'kill', 'Harry', 'Voldemort', 'magical', 'powers', 'Why', ""n't"", 'Voldemort', 'just', 'use', 'magical', 'powers', 'kill', 'Harry', 'What', 'preventing', 'have', 'idea', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'magical', 'powers', 'are', 'apportioned', 'resisted', 'world', 'scene', 'scene', 'wands', 'chases', 'searches', 'never', 'knew', 'what', 'anyone', 'could', 'do', 'what', 'spell', 'wand', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'was', 'stake', 'what', 'needed', 'be', 'done', 'protect', 'what', 'was', 'stake', 'one', 'point', 'Ron', 'Harry', 'more', 'What', 'Box', 'office', 'revenue.There', 'scene', 'where', 'Harry', 'caught', 'ice', 'alone', 'forest', 'night', 'real', 'claustrophobe', 'paranoid', 'nightmare', 'found', 'could', 'watch', 'scene', 'anxiety', 'Now', 'poor', 'filmmaking.There', 'so', 'much', 'stuff', 'slathered', 'onscreen', 'eccentric', 'English', 'cottages', 'floating', 'pears', 'growing', 'front', 'door', 'magical', 'tents', 'protective', 'snowy', 'owls', 'elevators', 'travel', 'sideways', 'never', 'once', 'said', 'Oooo', 'Aaaa', 'scene', 'where', 'multiple', 'Harrys', 'bear', 'multiple', 'post-adolescent', 'nicely', 'muscled', 'newly', 'hairy', 'chests', 'ooo', 'baby', 'Nothing', 'felt', 'magical', 'ever', 'present', 'onscreen', 'junk', 'had', 'same', 'loud', 'tacky', 'K-Mart', 'Christmas', 'feel', 'Less', 'more', 'anyone', 'was', 'one', 'scene', 'worked', 'was', 'caught', 'up', 'even', 'was', 'watching', 'imagined', 'legions', 'fangirls', 'watching', 'scene', 'again', 'again', 'home', 'version', 'released', 'Harry', 'Hermione', 'are', 'feeling', 'low', 'are', 'alone', 'tent', 'forest', 'Music', 'playing', 'staticky', 'radio', 'camera', 'Hermione', 'glow', 'kerosene', 'lamp', 'Suddenly', 'view', 'Hermione', 'blocked', 'Harry', 'sweater-clad', 'shoulder', 'same', 'way', 'blocking', 'scene', 'overwhelming', 'Hermione', 'consciousness', 'hand', 'dance', 'bodies', 'directed', 'despair', 'hunger', 'intimacy', 'other', 'fear', 'satisfying', 'desire', 'not', 'wise', 'idea', 'truly', 'magical', 'scene', 'too', 'brief', 'required', 'special', 'effects', 'just', 'young', 'people', 'care', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'thrive', 'do', 'contact', 'music', 'art', 'dance', 'life-or-death', 'situation']",N/A

1240662,AUEHG0DB54B7K,B001UV4XHY,David A. Wend,"[3, 5]","I have not read any of the Harry Potter books and so look at each of the films without knowing how they were adapted from page to screen.  As with any adaptation, there will be parts of the story that are changed or removed.  Part one of the final film is quite dark as Voldemort's power dominates the wizarding world. Harry, Ron and Hermione vow to find and destroy all of the Horcruxes in order to kill Voldemort but they have little idea how to accomplish this.The film follows the battle between the forces of good and evil with evil winning. There are systematic efforts to get rid of wizards that do not agree with Voldemort's notions of pure blood.  Dumbledoor's supports are hunted down.  There are broadcasts where the names of captured or killed wizards are announced. The lack of hope pervades the film as Harry, Ron and Hermione are forced to hide in remote places. The locations chosen for their hiding places were visually stunning.Daniel Radcliffe turns in a good performance as does Rupert Grint and Emma Watson, who shows a broader range of emotions in this film.  This film centers more on the characters of the three central wizards and they carry off the film very well.  They are supported by a host of British actors that mostly make very brief appearances. Bill Nighly has a brief part as Rufus Scrimgeour, but it is a pivotal one as he provides Harry, Ron and Hermione with items that can help them find the Horcruxes.  Imelda Staunton briefly reprises her role as Dolores Umbridge.  Helena Bonham Carter and Jason Isaacs were, as always, very good being evil.  In addition, Dobby makes a substantial appearance again appearing to help Harry in his time of need. The animation of Dobby (and the elf Kreecher) was much more life like than I recall from previous films.I did find that the film was a bit slow as Harry, Hermione and Ron hide out trying to discover what to do next.  These scenes added to the tense atmosphere of the film but were too long.  The suggestion was made by one reviewer that the movie is following the book on this point but on screen, it didn't quite work for me.  On the other hand, the scene where polyjuice is used to create multiple Potters is one of the delights of the film and adds a bit of humor to the serious trouble Harry is in.  I thought the animation that told the story of the Deathly Hallows was well done. The music by Alexander Desplait very much added to the mood of the film.",5,The Dark Before the Dawn,1290729600,"11 26, 2010",2010,2445,"['have', 'not', 'read', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'books', 'so', 'look', 'films', 'knowing', 'how', 'were', 'adapted', 'page', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'will', 'be', 'parts', 'story', 'are', 'changed', 'removed', 'Part', 'one', 'final', 'film', 'quite', 'dark', 'Voldemort', 'power', 'wizarding', 'world', 'Harry', 'Ron', 'Hermione', 'vow', 'find', 'destroy', 'Horcruxes', 'order', 'kill', 'Voldemort', 'have', 'little', 'idea', 'how', 'accomplish', 'this.The', 'film', 'battle', 'forces', 'good', 'evil', 'evil', 'winning', 'are', 'systematic', 'efforts', 'get', 'rid', 'wizards', 'do', 'not', 'agree', 'Voldemort', 'notions', 'pure', 'blood', 'Dumbledoor', 'supports', 'are', 'hunted', 'down', 'are', 'broadcasts', 'where', 'names', 'captured', 'killed', 'wizards', 'are', 'announced', 'lack', 'hope', 'film', 'Harry', 'Ron', 'Hermione', 'are', 'forced', 'hide', 'remote', 'places', 'locations', 'chosen', 'hiding', 'places', 'were', 'visually', 'stunning.Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'good', 'performance', 'Rupert', 'Grint', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'who', 'broader', 'range', 'emotions', 'film', 'film', 'more', 'characters', 'three', 'central', 'wizards', 'carry', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'are', 'supported', 'host', 'British', 'actors', 'mostly', 'make', 'very', 'brief', 'appearances', 'Bill', 'Nighly', 'brief', 'part', 'Rufus', 'Scrimgeour', 'pivotal', 'one', 'Harry', 'Ron', 'Hermione', 'items', 'can', 'help', 'find', 'Horcruxes', 'Imelda', 'Staunton', 'briefly', 'role', 'Dolores', 'Umbridge', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'Jason', 'Isaacs', 'were', 'always', 'very', 'good', 'being', 'evil', 'addition', 'Dobby', 'substantial', 'appearance', 'again', 'appearing', 'help', 'Harry', 'time', 'need', 'animation', 'Dobby', 'elf', 'Kreecher', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'life', 'recall', 'previous', 'films.I', 'did', 'find', 'film', 'was', 'bit', 'slow', 'Harry', 'Hermione', 'Ron', 'hide', 'out', 'trying', 'discover', 'what', 'do', 'next', 'scenes', 'added', 'tense', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'were', 'too', 'long', 'suggestion', 'was', 'made', 'one', 'reviewer', 'movie', 'following', 'book', 'point', 'screen', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'other', 'hand', 'scene', 'where', 'polyjuice', 'used', 'create', 'multiple', 'Potters', 'one', 'delights', 'film', 'bit', 'humor', 'serious', 'trouble', 'Harry', 'thought', 'animation', 'told', 'story', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'music', 'Alexander', 'Desplait', 'very', 'much', 'added', 'mood', 'film']",N/A

In a series with such a large cast and such a convoluted storyline, it is good to see a renewed emphasis on character.  This is the brilliance in spreading this final episode out over two films (apart from the extra dollars to be made).  Many of the other films have felt rushed, and the scenes in which our heroes camp out in isolation would surely have been greatly curtailed if not cut altogether without the breathing room this approach provides.

That should make for a really grand finish to the series. Part 1 is a generally exciting film that holds one's attention very well. Although the section where the three are on the run may seem to slow down the pace, the movie tracks the book pretty well and these scenes provide an opportunity to reveal the emotions with which each of them must deal.I've noticed some negative comments on sound and picture and have just replayed the opening part with the sole intention of evaluating the sound and picture; the results are conclusive, they are both outstanding. The surround speakers are given a terrific workout and the subwoofer is nicely exercised as well. I would give both sound and picture top marks for excellence. The picture is crisp and clear and never too dark so as to mask the action.I would agree that if one had not read the book it could be more difficult to follow the story's turns and twists. If one has not read the book this would be a great time to do just that. I believe it was better to divide the book into two parts so the story could be more systematically covered. I hope the release of the Blu-ray 3D version will not be delayed too long after the movie is released in theaters.In summary, this is an outstanding movie version of the first part of the book and provides a solid platform for the completion of the story.

Professor Rowling is, needless to say, impressively well-read.Having come a long way from the first film, which was lit in a warm and glowing hues, the late adolescent years of Harry Potter are captured  in darker, sinister, and more shadowy tones.We begin with the Minister of Magic, Rufus Scrimgeour(Bill Nighy) reassuring the British Wizarding world of the strength of the Ministry  despite the tightening of the grip of the Dark Forces.Former Hogwarts Professor and current Headmaster Severus Snape(Alan Rickman) arrives at Malfoy Manor, the home of Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy(Jason Isaacs and Helen McRory), and their son, Draco( Tom Felton), which has been  commandeered  by Voldemort and the Death Eaters to discuss the whereabouts of Harry and their plan to eliminate all non-pureblood wizards. Hoping to cement the loyalty of his followers, including  Death Eater politician Pius Thicknesse(Guy Henry), Voldemort victimizes Hogwarts' former Muggle Studies Professor, Charity Burbage(Carolyn Pickles) whose pleas for aid from her friend Snape go unanswered. Young Draco witnesses this episode with visible sickness and pallor.In the meantime, Harry has seen his relatives, the Dursleys(Richard Griffiths, Fiona Shaw and Harry Melling) safely evacuated from their home on Privet Drive, as they are under threat( The unedited version shows Mrs. Dursley's expression of regret over the loss of her sister as she departs); Hermione, enacting her own ""Witches' Protection Program"",  erases her Muggle parents' (Ian Kelly, Michelle Finley) memory of her before leaving home, while Ron waits to take action at his now-rebuilt home, The Burrow.Harry packs his bags and his bird, Hedwig, awaiting his final departure , and in a poignant moment, pausing one last time to inspect the cupboard under the stairs, which was his initial room, and the little soldier figurines that were his only playthings.Soon the painful memories are replaced with glad tidings as he welcomes his best friends and other members of the Order of the Phoenix into the Dursley's unfurnished living room, including the now-married Lupin and Tonks(David Thewlis, Natalia Tena), Mad-Eye Moody(Brendan Gleeson), Ron's oldest brother, Bill(Domhall Gleeson), whom Harry meets for the first time, and his now-fiancee Fleur de La Coeur(Clemence Poesy), the Weasley Twins(James and Oliver Phelps), Mundungus Fletcher( Andy Linden) on whom Moody keeps a tight reign, Kingsley Shacklebot(George Harris), and Hagrid(Robbie Coltrane)besides Ron and Hermione.Moody informs Harry that  those now in charge of the Ministry no longer have any part in his protection, and that Harry has a trace on him. Despite Harry's protests, Fleur, Ron, Hermione, the twins, and Mundungus  take on Harry's physical persona using polyjuice potion under Moody's supervision, temporarily transforming into Harry's dopplegangers to confuse lurking death eaters, who will hopefully be unable to detect Harry as he transfers to a safehouse--specifically, The Burrow. The journey is almost immediate perilous with two casualties and a serious injury.After waking from another telling bad dream, a guilt-ridden Harry sets out from  the Burrow with backback in tow, intending to begin the horcrux-finding mission, but Ron reminds him that he will need help and turns him back.As preparations for Bill and Fleur's wedding get underway there is a sweetly intimate boyfriend-girlfriend moment when Ron's burgeoning kid sister, Ginny (Bonnie Wright), dressed for the event, seeks assistance in the zipping of her gown, revealing her flawless  porcelain back as Harry gently obliges. The two express their views on the appropriateness of a wedding, ""given everything that's going on"" in Ginny's words. Harry reveals he is in agreement with Ron about the matter, whereas his views had ben different shortly before. The young couple kiss although Harry sheepishly departs when George Weasley shows up... Perhaps a little foreshadowing of domestic bliss for our hero?Scrimgeour appears to execute Dumbledore's (Michael Gambon's) will, in which he bequeathes his delumiator to Ron, a copy of a children's book, ""The Tales of the Beetle Bard"" to Hermione, and  the first golden snitch Harry caught in a Quidditch game to Harry, as well as the missing Sword of Griffyndor.Harry enjoys the wedding, where he is reunited with Luna Lovegood( Evanna Lynch) and introduced to her father, Xenophilius(Rhys Ifans), editor of the newspaper, ""The Quibbler"", which unlike its rival, ""The Daily Prophet"", supports Harry, who notices a pendant with a mysterious symbol worn by Mr. Lovegood. A chat with 'Prophet' Commentator Elphias Dodge(Peter Cartwight), and the Weasley's aunt Muriel( Matyelok Gibbs) before word comes of the Ministry's fall, Scrimegeour's death, and the approach of the Death Eaters. Harry Ron and Hermione dissapparate, seeking refuge in London. Having planting an extension charm in her small bag, Hermione provides clothes into which they can change. A brief respite in a diner is interrupted by two more Death Eaters.They hide at Grimmauld Place as they had done previously. House elf Kreatur(Timothy Bates) is caught spying on them after they find a fake horcrux, and they learn that Mundungus Fletcher stole the real one. They dispatch him to find Fletcher, and along with Dobby, retrieve him and learn that Dolores Umbridge( Imelda Staunton) now has the real horcrux.The three launch a James Bond style mission to  break into the Ministry and retrieve the horcrux, involving polyjuice potion, floo  networks, and exiting via commodes. The ministry shows trappings reminiscent of Nazi Germany, with brutal interrogations about wizards' family backgrounds, and an anti-Muggle propaganda machine. Disguised as Official Albert Runcorn (David O' Hara), Harry learns of a hit list of Muggle supporters, where he sees the photos of those he lost and learns that Hermione is targeted.Disguised as Reginald Cattermole(Steffan Rhodie), whose wife Mary(Kate Fleetwood)is under interrogation and Malfalda Hopkirk(Sophie Thompson) , Ron and Hermione manage to claim the horcrux and escape, rescuing Mrs. Cattermole in the process. But Ministry Official Yaxley ( Peter Mullen) nearly captures them.After treating an injured Ron, Harry and Hermione set up camp in a forest, they spend their days unsuccessfully trying to destroy the locket. When they decide to take turns wearing it, the evil locket brings out depression in Hermione and belligerence in each of the boys. Hermione has an epiphinal moment about an matter concerning the much-need sword of Griffyndor, but as they relocate, tensions between the boys increase, and the insecure Ron  accuses Hermione of preferring Harry to him, and after a near physical fight, in which he dismisses Harry's concern for his family,Ron leaves.Harry consoles Hermione as they dissapparate to the White Cliffs of Dover. There is a sweet scene of temporary delight in their tent when the two dance to music on the radio, courtesy of the ever-considerate Harry, who tries to bring Hermione out of her funk. They soon visit Harry's birthplace, Godric's Hollow on Christmas Eve, where Hermione sees the mysterious symbol worn by Mr. Lovegood on a churchyard grave, and  a tearful Harry stands before his parents' grave in the film's most poignant scene.The celebrated wizard authoress Bathilda Bagshot(Hazel Douglas), encounters them outside the church, and they go to the house where Harry's parents were slain . Voldemort's snake Nagini, emerges from Bathilda Bagshot's now immobile corpse to confront the two teens, and Harry is back in battle in his former nursery. Hermione rescues him, taking him to the Forest of Dean, where the sword appears, and Ron returns in time to rescue Harry from drowning in the lake, nearly strangled by the locket, which Ron destroys. The reconciled trio meet with Mr. Lovegood , who, after Hermione narrates an impressively shown tale featuring computerized shadow puppetry, reveals the symbol of the Deathly Hallows, but then forbids his guests to leave explaining that the Dark Lord has kidnapped Luna and will return her if he turns Harry over to him.Lovegood's plans go awry and the three escape, but are soon caught and taken to Malfoy Manor by snatchers. Belllatrix Lestrange,(Helena Bonham Carter),insists that her nephew, Draco positively identify the temporarily disfigured Harry, but Draco declines. Bellatrix tortures Hermione as Harry and Ron are thrown into the dungeon with Mr. Ollivander, the wandmaker(John Hurt), the goblin Griphhook(Warwick Davis) and Luna.A battle ensues but the captives are rescued by an old friend with tragic consequences. As a close ally is lovingly lowered into his grave amid sands and tall wind-bent grasses as gentle as his nature, the Dark Lord cracks open another grave to steal the most powerful wand ever made to prepare for the final showdown....",5,More Dark and Dark it Grows...More Dark and Dark Their Woes,1375833600,"08 7, 2013",2013,9750,"['what', 'otherwise', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'seventh', 'year',

1240676,A3GHBLTVJLRPAH,B001UV4XHY,Derek,"[0, 1]","I have always enjoyed the Harry Potter films and my liking of them has increased with each new film that is released. And before I go any further, I should note that I did not read any of the books (except for the first one) before seeing the films. I am much more of a movie fan (obviously) and my philosophy is that if you want to be able to enjoy both the movies and the books, see the movie first.Now, back to Harry Potter. This film marks the beginning of the end as Harry, Hermione and Ron travel the world looking for horcruxes (evil artifacts containing pieces of Voldemort's soul) and the means to destroy them.This is my least favorite film in the franchise. It was dark, it was depressing, and it raised more questions than answers. Now, I know that this is supposed to be a two-parter and since the story is only half finished, there will always be lots of questions. But overall, there was very little here to enjoy. Every movie usually has a stunning climax and some really cool magical moments in the film, and this one lacked both. The climax was weak and there wasn't really anything new to see in this film. Nothing that we haven't really seen before. And if we've seen it all before...I'm sure most of my opinions will change (hopefully) with the viewing of the second part, but until then, I'm not a big fan of this film. Aside from that, the special effects were impressive, the acting was well played, and the story moved smoothly.As far as questionable content:The film is dark and there are some scary and violent moments throughout. This is not recommended for younger children.*Spoiler Alert*According to the book, In the moment where Ron faces off against the demon within the horcrux, he is given a vision of Harry and Hermione in love and there is a moment where they kiss. In the film, the ""kiss"" became more of a sex scene with Harry and Hermione making out while completely nude. You never see any private parts, but it is a very risky scene.

So the filming puts you into a mood the characters and action does not really support.  And speaking of action, this moving is terribly lacking.  The previous potter movies were action packed with all sorts of jokes and interactions.  This movie has some action, then it goes on some long drawn out hiatus.  The characters blink onto some deserted island or forest, and its totally barren.  And they sit there and look at each other for like 5 minutes.  I just can't get into it.  Seems like this is how they stretched two movies out of this.  By putting in all this dead time.Then the tension between the 3 main characters seems forced and strained.  Its unnatural, based on the previous films.  Even if there is some underlying magical reason for it, it does not come across right.  Even the story.  The way this begins with characters that are not really bad, being in league with bad characters is awkward.

In all honesty I did not like the Deathly Hallows part 1 as well as I did the rest of the series.  But over time it grew on me, and I can watch it.  But it would not have earned a 4 star rating if not for the fact that I just saw Deathly Hallows part 2.  Anything I would have stated negatively about part 1 was erased immediately.  The producers of the film had no choice but to split the story in two parts.  At first I thought it was for the money, but that is not the case.  Sure there is about 30 minutes of this movie, I thought was a waste of film stock, so it could have been made a little shorter and still had the same impact.  However, overall for fans of the books (which I have never read); this was the only way for the movie to go.Now for the part I really wanted to write about.  If you have not seen Deathly Hallows part 2, go see it!!!!  It is (in my opinion) the best movie of the entire series!  I knew quite a bit about it from reading snippets of the books from various sites, but never realized how great the story actually was.  What surprises me even more is that I was not at first a fan of the series.  The first film I found a little too childish. The second one was better, but then again it was still a bit childish for my taste. However, as the series progressed, I will say this is a must own series for anyone.  In fact (like Star Trek, and soon like Star Wars) I plan to own these movies on both DVD and Blu Ray so that the films can be watched in different rooms that might not be equipped with a Blu Ray player.I will not go into this review any further due to the amount of secrets this film and it's sequel reveal.  After seeing the latest one, and this one back to back, I think I will have to go back and rewatch the entire series in order again.  This movie and the newest one is the perfect ending for an excellent story.Enough said.

1240707,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B001UV4XHY,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[0, 0]","**THIS HAS MAJOR SPOILERS (LIKE I CARE!)**HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS - PART 1 (2010) is a great warts-and-all film. How ironic, since it is about witches and wizards. My original review, though almost all here, is scrapped in favor of kicking off complaining about Daniel Radcliffe. He can act, certainly, but in this film he's more than flat. Frustration and angst is the character's hallmark, but the days of a sometimes sweet and charming Harry are days long gone. Be aware of that and beware Radcliffe's unforgivable failures as a young adult actor.This is a very skillful adaptation of novel-to-script, and let no one dispute that fact.The kids (Daniel Radcliffe in spite of it all, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson) are a delight, a true delight! How they've grown, yet they remain themselves.This film's power is mostly in its gloomy silence. Andr&eacute; Desplat's soundtrack, as thin as wispy mountain air, is nonetheless brilliant. Also, Yates handled the disgusting scenes very well. He had to put them in - Rowling wrote it that way, didn't she? I believe Yates split the story - that is, brought Part I to its end - at the perfect moment. I wondered where they'd split it.Now the BAD:The others in this film are a bit on the cardboard site. One expects better, though the acting (such as it is) is great. If you do not blink, otherwise you'll miss it. It angered me that Rufus Scrimegeour (Bill Nighy) was not introduced in the last film as he ought to have been, and here he appears for all of exactly five minutes, including a full minute-plus in the opening scene. This was saved only by the fact that Bill Nighy is as great as ever.What I did love about Scrimegeour was his speech, that opens the film. It was straight from Margaret Thatcher and would have done the old lady proud. I thought it was deeply moving yet hilarious; English audiences will instantly perceive it but I doubt it will have any impact on the American viewer.While I myself cannot tell whether Scrimegeour is talking with a Welsh or Scots accent, it is a precise growl that grabs your attention no matter what. (He says, ""deluminator-r-r-r"" with a velvety purr.) The whole character is reminiscent of the character's name: it is a Scots name and has its own tartan, but it is a sept of a larger clan name. This is the kind of depth you can expect from these great actors, given what little they've got with which to work here.Further, the film sags horribly during its central 40 minutes. Bad, especially after its genius beginning and follow-through. It was intended to do that, but I think it was 40 minutes totally wasted.Oh, now give me a break: Indo-Chinese style shadow puppets to tell the story of the Three Brothers? How unnecessarily cheap Yates can be! They do better than this with crummy historical reenactments in documentaries. And how he skimped on the magic - a fate Roger Ebert tellingly prophesied almost ten years ago.There were disgusting moments that, although I can see as necessary, really should have been re-written for younger viewers. That's just me. Otherwise, there's nothing else. I LOVED this film and wish that the POTTER craze had used a bit more of Yates' tricks in the past. Impossible, but I wish it. Someone said this is ""the most cinematically satisfying"" of all the films. Agreed, but only to a degree.WHAT I REALLY WANTED TO SEE AND WAS COMPLETELY IGNORED: Harry and Hermione seeing the ""Potter Memorials"" in Godric's Hollow. A bit more dialogue might have helped.WHAT I REALLY LOVED SEEING (ALMOST AS MUCH AS HARRY, RON AND HERMIONE): Domhnall Gleeson as Bill Weasely. He's a handsome redhead and I wish they'd shown more.PAY ATTENTION: I will only ever explain this once and tough toenails if you think it spoils anything. It is about the wands. Dumbledore of course owns the Elder Wand. Draco disarmed Dumbledore at the tower before Dumbledore died, so the Elder Wand belonged to Draco. Note: one does not need to take the actual wand or fight against it to defeat its master.Therein lies the trick: when Harry disarms Draco of some paltry wands at the Malfoy mansion (shown vividly here), Harry becomes the Elder Wand master. So the fact that Dumbledore is buried with it, and Voldemort steals it, is of no consequence. Harry is still its master as soon as he beats Draco by disarming him.Ending: Voldemort cannot kill Harry with the Elder Wand stolen from Dumbledore's tomb: the wand recognizes its true master. However, he does stun the part of himself that lives in Harry. When Harry awakens, all he has to do then is defend himself and let Voldemort kill himself with his own Avada Kedavra curse. See? Simple.Get this film, no question about that. I hear the Blu-Ray or whatever it's called has terrific extras, which the single, plain-jane DVD does not. The single edition only has deleted scenes, and not nearly as much footage as I expected.DVD COMPLAINING: We were cheated with the plain single DVD for some reason. It has some deleted scenes and there was a lot of smoke and mirrors about what extras would be on the single edition. Remember, this is the arm-twisting that will force us all sooner or later to get Blu-Ray. That angers me more than Warner Brother's habitual broken promises and lies.Yes, there is a double-disc plain DVD edition because we considered it before just getting the single plain one. I'm tired of the almost-100% lame quality of POTTER extras. It's just that there is so much more and apparently the Blu-Ray special is a 3-disc. See? The air is full of rip-offs!We didn't get our single edition at W**~M*** but they did have the double plain DVD edition there ... where was that ... T**** I think.And yes, WB should be FINED for their habitual lies, bait-n-switch and broken promises. This is the beginning of the forced move to Blu-Ray.One day, no regular DVDs will be seen anywhere.For all the negatives, I demerit one star. For Warner Brothers/DVD distributor in America, I give the biggest raspberry in the universe!!",4,Muggles Need Not Apply,1302825600,"04 15, 2011",2011,5995,"['**THIS', 'MAJOR', 'SPOILERS', 'LIKE',

That's because the film, while making sense to people who've seen the others and read the books, won't to those who haven't.  Even if you are a diehard Harry fan, you'll probably have your own opinions about what ought to have been included, and what wasn't.  You may feel that some characters deserved more screen time and more of a backstory. But you'll probably agree that the second-to-last movie in the ""Harry"" series does a more than competent job of adapting the (unwieldy plotwise) book.If you're going in cold, you may wonder things like, ""What the heck is Horcrux?""  ""Why aren't the kids still in school?""  ""Who are all these characters that only get a few minutes of screen time and disappear without any real explanation?"" and so on.  Well, the kids have decided not to return to school after Headmaster Dumbledore's death in the last movie.  A Horcrux is a piece of soul, and Voldemort has figured out a way to split himself into seven different ones. Before the final showdown with Voldy, Harry must recover all these Horcruxes. That's why he goes on that camping trip with just his two pals.  Harry also has a telepathic connection with Voldy (again not explained) which allows him to be suddenly plunged into Voldy's memory.  That accounts for some of the odd flashbacks.For most of the movie, Harry, Hermione and Ron are on their own, dodging the frequent magic hurled at them by Voldemort's crew, while searching for Horcruxes and trying to decipher why Dumbledore left them each a gift in his will. Most of the major characters from the previous films (who haven't died) pop in for an appearance including Alan Rickman as the nefarious Severus Snape; Imelda Stanton as former Hogwart's Headmistress who now holds a position in the Ministry of Magic; and Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy, Harry's nemesis who has also been forced to grow up rather fast. Ralph Fiennes plays Voldemort capably as usual, but the villian who looks like she's having the most fun is Helena Bonham Carter, as Bellatrix.  (Sadly, there is no Neville, but I expect we'll see him in the next film.)You could argue that so much of the movie is unrelentingly bleak, spends too much time on the Great Camping Trip, etc., but all these things can also be said of the book it's based on.  I, for one, felt a bit cheated at having to wait for yet another film, but to be fair, I don't see how the book would be better as a single film.

It is build-up for the final battle. (An entire movie, mostly bent around one task)2. Some character you like/love will die. Nuff said there.3. Some scenes are definately NOT for young children. (Bellatrix scene interrogating Hermione is a good example)4. Ron...What was he thinking? I don't think a friend, especially one who has been through so much, would act this way. But...that is a personal observation. Would have liked to see more bonding. Not in a weird way but in a best friends way.5. Not enough Harry and Ginny.

1240721,A38JWSLCF9AYOZ,B001UV4XHY,Fluffy's Owner,"[12, 17]","The final Harry Potter movie, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, is an adaptation of the darkest book in the series. It only makes sense that the film is also going to be the darkest of its series. Harry Potter 7 was felt by the production crew to be so complex, despite not being the longest book in the series, that they reached a decision to split the film into two parts. So far, the first part, despite being out for only 8 days, has grossed about $400M. Now, onto the actual review! Im spite of the decision to split the film into two parts, everything still couldn't be included. It's best to judge it only as a movie, like the others, rather than as an adaptation of the book. My rating of the movie is 5 out of 5 stars. One of the reasons is that the characters have greatly developed from what they once were. Character development is always very important to anything that has characters, and no character development usually makes you not care about the characters at all! An example of this is Severus Snape. In the first two books and movies, Snape is purely hateable. There is a bit of humor behind the fact that Snape is so detestable. For instance, Snape makes up new rules just to have an excuse to take points off Gryffindor. In the third book and movie, it shows that Snape wasn't always to blame though. One time, he was almost killed, as a prank. In the fourth, it's shown that Snape is a spy for Dumbledore. In The Order of the Phoenix, despite the fact that Snape is even worse to Harry than usual, without him Harry would be in a much worse predicament than he was, at the end of the book (and film). In the sixth one, it's very obvious that he's evil. For those who haven't read the book, I won't spoil it, however Snape is still more complex than good or bad. Another example of character development is the trio of Harry, Ron, and Hermione. My final example is how Dobby came from being a miserable house elf who usually got Harry injured in his attempts to help him, to a worker at Hogwarts. Dobby then strives to return the favor. Another reason this film merits a 5-star rating is the little touches added to the adaptation. For instance, the scene with Harry and Hermione dancing, after Ron leaves. Another such touch is the animation going with The Tale of the Three Brothers, when it is read aloud by Hermione. The film ended perfectly, leaving you wanting more. Nevertheless, it's very aggravating that we'll have to wait about 7 months to see the next one! In my opinion, the film was made stronger by introducing the Hallows themselves in this first act, rather than squeezing them into the second and making it look like an afterthought. The acting, for the next example of the film's rating, is superlative and stupendous. Every single person was perfect for their role and, if I were the director, I would not cast anyone else. The visuals are also great, ranging from black gloominess to a busy ministry to nice beaches and to snowy forests. These are only a few reasons why I think Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows earns a 5-star rating.",5,A 12-year-old's review,1290816000,"11 27, 2010",2010,3086,"['final', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movie', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'adaptation', 'darkest', 'book', 'series', 'only', 'sense', 'film', 'also', 'going', 'be', 'darkest', 'series', 'Harry', 'Potter', '7', 'was', 'felt', 'production', 'crew', 'be', 'so', 'complex', 'not', 'being', 'longest', 'book', 'series', 'reached', 'decision', 'split', 'film', 'two', 'parts', 'So', 'far', 'first', 'part', 'being', 'out', 'only', '8', 'days', 'grossed', '400M', 'Now', 'actual', 'review', 'Im', 'spite', 'decision', 'split', 'film', 'two', 'parts', 'everything', 'still', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'included', 'best', 'judge', 'only', 'movie', 'others', 'rather', 'adaptation', 'book', 'rating', 'movie', '5', '5', 'stars', 'One', 'reasons', 'characters', 'have', 'greatly', 'developed', 'what', 'once', 'were', 'Character', 'development', 'always', 'very', 'important', 'anything', 'characters', 'character', 'development', 'usually', 'not', 'care', 'characters', 'example', 'Severus', 'Snape', 'first', 'two', 'books', 'movies', 'Snape', 'purely', 'hateable', 'bit', 'humor', 'fact', 'Snape', 'so', 'detestable', 'instance', 'Snape', 'up', 'new', 'rules', 'just', 'have', 'excuse', 'take', 'points', 'off', 'Gryffindor', 'third', 'book', 'movie', 'Snape', 'was', ""n't"", 'always', 'blame', 'One', 'time', 'was', 'almost', 'killed', 'prank', 'fourth', 'shown', 'Snape', 'spy', 'Dumbledore', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'fact', 'Snape', 'even', 'worse', 'Harry', 'usual', 'Harry', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'worse', 'predicament', 'was', 'end', 'book', 'film', 'sixth', 'one', 'very', 'obvious', 'evil', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'however', 'Snape', 'still', 'more', 'complex', 'good', 'bad', 'example', 'character', 'development', 'trio', 'Harry', 'Ron', 'Hermione', 'final', 'example', 'how', 'Dobby', 'came', 'being', 'miserable', 'house', 'elf', 'who', 'usually', 'got', 'Harry', 'injured', 'attempts', 'help', 'worker', 'Hogwarts', 'Dobby', 'then', 'return', 'favor', 'reason', 'film', '5-star', 'rating', 'little', 'touches', 'added', 'adaptation', 'instance', 'scene', 'Harry', 'Hermione', 'dancing', 'Ron', 'such', 'touch', 'animation', 'going', 'Tale', 'Three', 'Brothers', 'when', 'read', 'aloud', 'Hermione', 'film', 'ended', 'perfectly', 'leaving', 'wanting', 'more', 'Nevertheless', 'very', 'aggravating', ""'ll"", 'have', 'wait', '7', 'months', 'see', 'next', 'one', 'opinion', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'stronger', 'introducing', 'Hallows', 'first', 'act', 'rather', 'squeezing', 'second', 'making', 'look', 'afterthought', 'acting', 'next', 'example', 'film', 'rating', 'superlative', 'stupendous', 'single', 'person', 'was', 'perfect', 'role', 'were', 'director', 'would', 'not', 'cast', 'anyone', 'else', 'visuals', 'are', 'also', 'great', 'ranging', 'black', 'gloominess', 'busy', 'ministry', 'nice', 'beaches', 'snowy', 'forests', 'are', 'only', 'few', 'reasons', 'why', 'think', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', '5-star', 'rating']",N/A

However, as a film in the series, it is still flawed on a number of narrative levels. I have not read the books -- I'm waiting for the series to come out on Kindle -- and so I can only speak to the stories as they have been presented in the movies. This is legitimate, as the movies *ought* to be a stand-alone narrative.Fundamental story matters are introduced without explanation (the mirror fragment) or eliminated without blinking (only *6* horcruxes are ever named and ultimately destroyed, even though it was explicitly stated that there were seven. Also, recall that Harry is the ""unnamed eighth"" horcrux that even Voldemort did not know about, and thus cannot be counted on this list.)I've a fair eye for such details, so when major details like these suddenly get added and/or subtracted w/o explanation, it creates a radical disruption in the movie for me. As a consequence, on first viewing this film was almost unintelligible to me. That takes some doing, and it is a doing that typically is not worth the effort.That said, having seen part II in the theatre, returning to part I (which I've now viewed a couple more times) the entire story line makes more sense, and the gaps and flaws of part I are much less distracting so that the OTHER details of the story-telling can now shine through.Those other details really are very well done.

This unfortunately does not work in the film's favor, precisely because the trend of the last few films was to dispense with a great deal of material from the books (and consequently improve upon them) in favor of giving us films which were incoherent as a series but which, for the most part, stood well on their own aesthetically.  And while this more impressionistic style of film-making didn't sit well with the Harry Potter purists, cinematically it was very respectable.

1240736,A1SHNOU2ODKIDG,B001UV4XHY,Gregorio,"[12, 14]","This review is for the Bly-ray/DVD combo pack.  Buyers should be aware that the only way to watch the special features for DEATHLY HOLLOWS is on the bluray disc.  They are not included on the DVD or digital copy.  As for the special features on the bluray disc, they are okay, consisting of mostly standard featuretts and the maximum movie gimmick that has all sorts of interviews and even readings from the book included while the movie plays.  It's okay but I can't imagine watching it more than once.  Beware of the digital copy as it includes lots of spyware and garbage you may not want on your computer (and the download takes up a mind boggling amount of space).  The transfer of both the bluray and the parts of the DVD that I checked seemed fine to me.  Complaints about the darkness and lack of color in the film seem to be fairly true to the original look of the film and are not really the result of a terrible transfer.  This is however by no means an exceptional looking disc.  Take ""professional"" reviews of discs on sights like HighDef Digest with a grain of salt as negative reviews from them mean repercussions from the studios who send them all sorts of freebies, swag and other forms of ""payment"" for good reviews.  On a well calibrated HDTV above 46 inches the bluray (and upconverted DVD transfer) of DEATHLY HOLLOWS will look fine but it certainly isn't ever going to pop or look colorful (and it isn't supposed to).  There is also some digital noise during a few sequences on the BD and they were more pronounced on the DVD.  There isn't any excuse for it other than slopiness from Warner. As far as the playability issues, they are most likely due to a DRM change at Warner and you will have to do a firmware update to your BD player.  If you have a player more than a couple years old (unless you are using a PS3) you will probably be out of luck and will have to watch the DVD or buy a new BD player.  /  This is a very standard 3 disc release these days which means you get (mostly) the same thing in three different versions.  If you want all the special features the only way to get them is on the BD version.  Walmart has a DVD only version that has special features but it DOES NOT include the maximum movie material which makes up the bulk of the special features. This scenario is becoming more and more common (standard practice for Disney with every release) and if studios make money from it ... it isn't going away any time soon so do your homework before you buy a disc.  It sucks but thats the way things are going.By the way...the PQ on the DEATHLY HOLLOWS bluray isn't any brighter or more vibrant than the DVD but there is a bit less noise.  THE AQ is noticeably better.  Undoubtedly Warner is saving lots of good stuff for the Ultimate box set edition which will be released after the final film.  Then the Limited Collectors Edition.  Then the Anniversary Edition.  Then the MudBlood Half Prince Hedwig Memorial Edition with collectible film cell made from genuine digital frame capture.  Then the Hagrid's Hut Edition with Keepsake keychain............",3,Understand what you are buying before you buy it.,1302998400,"04 17, 2011",2011,3098,"['review', 'Bly-ray/DVD', 'combo', 'pack', 'Buyers', 'should', 'be', 'aware', 'only', 'way', 'watch', 'special', 'features', 'DEATHLY', 'HOLLOWS', 'bluray', 'disc', 'are', 'not', 'included', 'DVD', 'digital', 'copy', 'special', 'features', 'bluray', 'disc', 'are', 'okay', 'consisting', 'mostly', 'standard', 'featuretts', 'maximum', 'movie', 'gimmick', 'sorts', 'interviews', 'even', 'readings', 'book', 'included', 'movie', 'okay', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'watching', 'more', 'once', 'Beware', 'digital', 'copy', 'lots', 'spyware', 'garbage', 'may', 'not', 'want', 'computer', 'download', 'up', 'mind', 'boggling', 'amount', 'space', 'transfer', 'bluray', 'parts', 'DVD', 'checked', 'seemed', 'fine', 'Complaints', 'darkness', 'lack', 'color', 'film', 'seem', 'be', 'fairly', 'true', 'original', 'look', 'film', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'result', 'terrible', 'transfer', 'however', 'means', 'exceptional', 'looking', 'disc', 'Take', 'professional', 'reviews', 'discs', 'sights', 'HighDef', 'Digest', 'grain', 'salt', 'negative', 'reviews', 'mean', 'repercussions', 'studios', 'who', 'send', 'sorts', 'freebies', 'swag', 'other', 'forms', 'payment', 'good', 'reviews', 'well', 'calibrated', 'HDTV', '46', 'inches', 'bluray', 'upconverted', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'DEATHLY', 'HOLLOWS', 'will', 'look', 'fine', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'ever', 'going', 'pop', 'look', 'colorful', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'also', 'digital', 'noise', 'few', 'sequences', 'BD', 'were', 'more', 'pronounced', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'excuse', 'other', 'slopiness', 'Warner', 'As', 'far', 'playability', 'issues', 'are', 'most', 'likely', 'due', 'DRM', 'change', 'Warner', 'will', 'have', 'do', 'firmware', 'update', 'BD', 'player', 'have', 'player', 'more', 'couple', 'years', 'old', 'are', 'using', 'PS3', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'luck', 'will', 'have', 'watch', 'DVD', 'buy', 'new', 'BD', 'player', '/', 'very', 'standard', '3', 'disc', 'release', 'days', 'get', 'mostly', 'same', 'thing', 'three', 'different', 'versions', 'want', 'special', 'only', 'way', 'get', 'BD', 'version', 'Walmart', 'DVD', 'only', 'version', 'special', 'features', 'NOT', 'include', 'maximum', 'movie', 'material', 'up', 'bulk', 'special', 'features', 'scenario', 'becoming', 'more', 'more', 'common', 'standard', 'practice', 'Disney', 'release', 'studios', 'make', 'money', ""n't"", 'going', 'away', 'time', 'soon', 'so', 'do', 'homework', 'buy', 'disc', 'way', 'things', 'are', 'going.By', 'way', 'PQ', 'DEATHLY', 'HOLLOWS', 'bluray', ""n't"", 'brighter', 'more', 'vibrant', 'DVD', 'bit', 'less', 'noise', 'AQ', 'noticeably', 'better', 'Undoubtedly', 'Warner', 'saving', 'lots', 'good', 'stuff', 'Ultimate', 'box', 'set', 'edition', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'final', 'film', 'Then', 'Limited', 'Collectors', 'Edition', 'Then', 'Anniversary', 'Edition', 'Then', 'MudBlood', 'Half', 'Prince', 'Hedwig', 'Memorial', 'Edition', 'collectible', 'film', 'cell', 'made', 'genuine', 'digital', 'frame', 'capture', 'Then', 'Hagrid', 'Hut', 'Edition', 'Keepsake', 'keychain']",N/A

1240758,A2OU415LB9I5J6,B001UV4XHY,Jason C. Wilkerson,"[41, 57]","In part seven of the Harry Potter series, we see great actors either returning to reprise their roles or showing up for the first time. Returning as a Ministry of Magic employee is former Defense Against the Dark Arts Teacher and temporary Headmistress of Hogwarts Delores Umbridge, played by Oscar nominee Imelda Staunten. Joining the cast for the first time is the amazing Bill Nighy (Still Crazy, Shaun of the Dead) playing the new Minister of Magic (unfortunately too short- lived a role), as well as the brilliant Rhys Ifans (Notting Hill, and the underrated Human Nature) as Luna Lovegood's father Xenophilius Lovegood. In the end what really makes this movie great is the characterization. This film would not work were it not for Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint doing their jobs properly. In Deathly Hallows, it's Rupert Grint who really delivers. Rupert has always been the comedic relief of the group, but here he provides the dramatic tension and performs beyond admirably.Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part I is all about character development. Yates, who's now directed more Harry Potter films than any other director in the series, does a great job of creating a film that maintains tension both between its main characters and the ever-present forces of good and evil that dominate the wizarding world. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part I is not about action or plot development; it focuses its attention largely on the people involved in these extraordinary adventures. J.K. Rowling gave us all a gift by creating such memorable figures to populate her books, and the directors of the Harry Potter films develop these well-loved characters against a brilliantly realized backdrop.[Spoiler Alert: If you have not read the books or seen the movie I recommend that you not read past this point]That said, Deathly Hallows is not without its flaws.  The changes that were made to realize this story in cinematic form are rather problematic. There's no full explanation as to why Dobby is around, so had you not read the book his presence might have been confusing. Kreacher's actions are also a mystery, as the troublesome house elf acquiesces too soon and easily to Harry's request without further explanation. Were it not for plot holes of this nature, this film would be much better. As the series has progressed, it seems that the Harry Potter films have strayed further and further from the source material. I'm a big fan of Order of the Phoenix and Half Blood Prince, both directed by Yates, but those movies left viewers ill prepared for this installment.The problem with converting this series into film form is the same as it is with any movie based on a book: the conflict that exists between the viewer's perception of the book and the director's. Most people would say that there has to be something wrong with either the viewer or the director when it comes to an adaptation of a novel, but in reality there's nothing wrong with either--they just sometimes differ. When it comes to Harry Potter, I'm a fan of both the books and the film adaptations, and one of the things that I like about the movies is the vision of the director. Yates has been brilliant at building these characters beyond what we've seen from them previously, and he continues to do just that in Deathly Hallows. There are things I would love to see in the movie adaptation, such as Kreacher's story of how he helped Regulus recover the locket, but would that detract from the story of Harry, Hermoine, and Ron? Most likely. That's why Yates is great. He knows where the real brilliance of the story lies, and that we can fill in the details by reading the books. He puts on film only what we need.Unfortunately, Yates is the fourth director involved in this series and the only one making these films with a knowledge of how Harry Potter's story ends. As a result, he's had to include things in this film that don't seem to make sense because of omissions made in earlier installments. Had Dobby been more involved in Goblet of Fire, his presence in this film would have seemed more logical and his death would have been more meaningful to the movie viewers who haven't read the books.[End of Spoilers]Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part I is a good movie, but not the best of the series. To a point it feels slightly episodic and ends quite abruptly. The acting is amazing, and the visuals are brilliant.

1240762,A2NF1RY31JF0HE,B001UV4XHY,"J. Buettner ""Jaws Fan""","[2, 4]","The 7th movie in this series is the best so far and the best adaptation from the book to the movies by a landslide.I found that the book moved extremely slow and had the characters parked in certain locations for months. I thought that this diminished the dangers they faced, the enlongated time in the book took away the tension. Also I thought with so much time gone by, couldn't they have come up with a better plan. Couldn't the Order of the Pheonix be doing the job that these three kids are doing? What are they doing during this time? The other good wizards seem to sit and wait to be picked off. It made no sense.The movie condensed the book timeframe and translated what took months in the book to seem like days in the film. I think this definately turned up the tension. In the film I felt these kids were constantly in danger and thus didn't have the time to formulate a clear plan. It made the risky decisions they made more plausable to me. It also made the absence of communication or action by the ""good"" wizards of the order of the Pheonix more understandable. I understand that the people who read the books want every detail in the films, but a lot of what was cut would make a very rocky translation to film (it just wouldn't work).After the first two movies of this series I really felt the screenwriter really got in a groove of how to translate this series. With the sheer number of characters, creatures, objects, and locations in this series they really did a great job of streamlining it and giving all these elements meaningful screentime. The Harry Potter film series is really amazing in how they were able to fill the roles with quality actors and retain those actors for a decade (the only exception was the original actor who played Dumbledore died after the second film). How lucky were they that they cast three children that grew into very capable actors and didn't have the ""Disney children melt downs"" that so many instantly famous children seem to do. Warner Brothers really did the Harry Potter film series right, a rarity in Hollywood really. Look what Lucas did to the Star War movies, yikes! Imagine if Steven Spielberg had got his way and combined the first two Harry Potter books into one movie (Thank goodness Spielberg never touched these movies!). All of the filmmakers they hired to direct parts 3 through 8 were perfect matches for the entry they made. Keeping the same screenwriter had a lot to do with the quality of this series (and the fact they kept Rowling involved through the whole adaptation too!) So bravo to Warner Brothers for getting something right!The fact of the matter is this film sets up the last film, and if part one is any indication I think they are going to knock part 2 out of the park. For all those claiming this movie did not have enough action, just wait. Knowing what's ahead, I think almost the entire second film will be high stakes action and based on what I've seen I bet the last film will be better than the second half of the last book too!",5,An example of how a film improved upon a book,1291075200,"11 30, 2010",2010,3026,"['7th', 'movie', 'series', 'best', 'so', 'far', 'best', 'adaptation', 'book', 'movies', 'landslide.I', 'found', 'book', 'moved', 'extremely', 'slow', 'had', 'characters', 'parked', 'certain', 'locations', 'months', 'thought', 'diminished', 'dangers', 'faced', 'enlongated', 'time', 'book', 'took', 'away', 'tension', 'Also', 'thought', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'gone', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'come', 'up', 'better', 'plan', 'Could', ""n't"", 'Order', 'Pheonix', 'be', 'doing', 'job', 'three', 'kids', 'are', 'doing', 'What', 'are', 'doing', 'time', 'other', 'good', 'wizards', 'seem', 'sit', 'wait', 'be', 'picked', 'off', 'made', 'sense.The', 'movie', 'condensed', 'book', 'timeframe', 'translated', 'what', 'took', 'months', 'book', 'seem', 'days', 'film', 'think', 'definately', 'turned', 'up', 'tension', 'film', 'felt', 'kids', 'were', 'constantly', 'danger', 'thus', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'formulate', 'clear', 'plan', 'made', 'risky', 'decisions', 'made', 'more', 'plausable', 'also', 'made', 'absence', 'communication', 'action', 'good', 'wizards', 'order', 'Pheonix', 'more', 'understandable', 'understand', 'people', 'who', 'read', 'books', 'want', 'detail', 'films', 'lot', 'what', 'was', 'cut', 'would', 'make', 'very', 'rocky', 'translation', 'film', 'just', 'would', ""n't"", 'work', '.After', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'series', 'really', 'felt', 'screenwriter', 'really', 'got', 'groove', 'how', 'translate', 'series', 'sheer', 'number', 'characters', 'creatures', 'objects', 'locations', 'series', 'really', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'streamlining', 'giving', 'elements', 'meaningful', 'screentime', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'film', 'series', 'really', 'amazing', 'how', 'were', 'able', 'fill', 'roles', 'quality', 'actors', 'retain', 'actors', 'decade', 'only', 'exception', 'was', 'original', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Dumbledore', 'died', 'second', 'film', 'How', 'lucky', 'were', 'cast', 'three', 'children', 'grew', 'very', 'capable', 'actors', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'Disney', 'children', 'melt', 'downs', 'so', 'many', 'instantly', 'famous', 'children', 'seem', 'do', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'really', 'did', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'film', 'series', 'right', 'rarity', 'Hollywood', 'really', 'Look', 'what', 'Lucas', 'did', 'Star', 'War', 'movies', 'yikes', 'Imagine', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'had', 'got', 'way', 'combined', 'first', 'two', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'books', 'one', 'movie', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'Spielberg', 'never', 'touched', 'movies', 'filmmakers', 'hired', 'direct', 'parts', '3', '8', 'were', 'perfect', 'matches', 'entry', 'made', 'Keeping', 'same', 'screenwriter', 'had', 'lot', 'do', 'quality', 'series', 'fact', 'kept', 'Rowling', 'involved', 'whole', 'adaptation', 'too', 'So', 'bravo', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'getting', 'something', 'right', 'fact', 'matter', 'film', 'up', 'last', 'film', 'part', 'one', 'indication', 'think', 'are', 'going', 'knock', 'part', '2', 'park', 'claiming', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'enough', 'action', 'just', 'wait', 'Knowing', 'what', 'ahead', 'think', 'almost', 'entire', 'second', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'high', 'stakes', 'action', 'based', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'bet', 'last', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'better', 'second', 'half', 'last', 'book', 'too']",N/A

1240764,A1FSLE0YF3BKVQ,B001UV4XHY,Jeannie Tran,"[18, 41]","Let me preface this by saying that I have not liked a Harry Potter movie since Chamber of Secrets, the last one that Chris Columbus directed. Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber of Secrets truly felt magical, filled with spells, unusual creatures, and wizards' robes. You really felt like you were in fantasy world. Understandably, as the series progresses the tone gets less happy and sparkly, and more ominous and gloomy. I don't think that should mean the magic factor has to be downplayed, or at least keep them in wizard garb. From Prisoner of Azkaban on they all look just like like regular kids at some boarding school in Europe, who just happen to have wands. Most of them shouldn't even know what muggle clothes look like, let alone sport the latest fashions.I did myself a disservice by rereading the book right before seeing the movie. As a total HP geek I of course want the movies to retain all details, but I realize that each movie would have to be about eight hours long for that to be possible. While reading there were many times where I thought, I wonder how they'll translate this info to film, and turns out their answer was to simply cut it. In the book we learn a great deal about Dumbledore's past, his family, and his connection to Grindelwald - the great dark wizard before Voldemort. The movie glosses over these things, mentioning them in passing without explanation. Instead they chose to waste time by drawing out the camping trips and adding in extraneous scenes like an impromptu dance session between Harry and Hermione. They also didn't have the kids using the Invisibility Cloak at all, while in the book they spent practically all their time traveling under that thing. While I can see from a cinematic standpoint that you can't have your main characters invisible for most of the film, it seemed like a strange thing to leave out entirely since the Cloak is actually one of the Deathly Hallows. I was, however, really impressed with the animation of the fable, The Three Brothers. For a moment I was afraid they were just going to have Hermione sit there and read it to us, but the little cartoon was a nice break in the film and was very artistic. It was surprising to me how gory this film was; they showed George's damaged ear and Ron's splinching in all their bloody glory, and even The Three Brothers tale (a children's story) was quite grisly and grim. I guess they didn't rate it PG-13 for nothing.Throughout the movie, I couldn't get over how old the kids looked. It feels weird to even call them ""kids."" Harry has a perpetual five 'o clock shadow, Ron is gargantuan, and Hermione seems to have fallen out of a J. Crew catalog.  All in all, it wasn't a bad movie but it wasn't great either. There were definitely a lot of moments that I enjoyed, but I think too many important details were left out or changed that I can't reasonably give this a good review.[...]",2,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Pt 1,1298160000,"02 20, 2011",2011,2901,"['Let', 'preface', 'saying', 'have', 'not', 'liked', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movie', 'Chamber', 'Secrets', 'last', 'one', 'Chris', 'Columbus', 'directed', 'Sorcerer', 'Stone', 'Chamber', 'Secrets', 'truly', 'felt', 'magical', 'filled', 'spells', 'unusual', 'creatures', 'wizards', 'robes', 'really', 'felt', 'were', 'fantasy', 'world', 'Understandably', 'series', 'tone', 'less', 'happy', 'sparkly', 'more', 'ominous', 'gloomy', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'should', 'mean', 'magic', 'factor', 'be', 'downplayed', 'least', 'keep', 'wizard', 'garb', 'Prisoner', 'Azkaban', 'look', 'just', 'regular', 'kids', 'boarding', 'school', 'Europe', 'who', 'just', 'happen', 'have', 'wands', 'Most', 'should', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'what', 'muggle', 'clothes', 'look', 'let', 'alone', 'sport', 'latest', 'fashions.I', 'did', 'disservice', 'rereading', 'book', 'right', 'seeing', 'movie', 'total', 'HP', 'geek', 'course', 'want', 'movies', 'retain', 'details', 'realize', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'about', 'eight', 'hours', 'long', 'be', 'possible', 'reading', 'were', 'many', 'times', 'where', 'thought', 'wonder', 'how', ""'ll"", 'translate', 'info', 'film', 'out', 'answer', 'was', 'simply', 'cut', 'book', 'learn', 'great', 'deal', 'Dumbledore', 'past', 'family', 'connection', 'Grindelwald', 'great', 'dark', 'wizard', 'Voldemort', 'movie', 'things', 'mentioning', 'passing', 'explanation', 'Instead', 'chose', 'waste', 'time', 'drawing', 'out', 'camping', 'trips', 'adding', 'extraneous', 'scenes', 'impromptu', 'dance', 'session', 'Harry', 'Hermione', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'kids', 'using', 'Invisibility', 'Cloak', 'book', 'spent', 'practically', 'time', 'traveling', 'thing', 'can', 'see', 'cinematic', 'standpoint', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'main', 'characters', 'invisible', 'most', 'film', 'seemed', 'strange', 'thing', 'leave', 'out', 'entirely', 'Cloak', 'actually', 'one', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'was', 'however', 'really', 'impressed', 'animation', 'fable', 'Three', 'Brothers', 'moment', 'was', 'afraid', 'were', 'just', 'going', 'have', 'Hermione', 'sit', 'there', 'read', 'little', 'cartoon', 'was', 'nice', 'break', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'artistic', 'was', 'surprising', 'how', 'gory', 'film', 'was', 'showed', 'George', 'damaged', 'ear', 'Ron', 'splinching', 'bloody', 'glory', 'even', 'Three', 'Brothers', 'tale', 'children', 'story', 'was', 'quite', 'grisly', 'grim', 'guess', 'did', ""n't"", 'rate', 'PG-13', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'how', 'old', 'kids', 'looked', 'weird', 'even', 'call', 'kids', 'Harry', 'perpetual', 'five', 'o', 'clock', 'shadow', 'Ron', 'gargantuan', 'Hermione', 'have', 'fallen', 'J', 'Crew', 'catalog', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'either', 'were', 'definitely', 'lot', 'moments', 'enjoyed', 'think', 'too', 'many', 'important', 'details', 'were', 'left', 'out', 'changed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'reasonably', 'give', 'good', 'review.', '[', ']']",N/A

1240767,A1RSXP7MB772E3,B001UV4XHY,"Jeff W. Shimkus ""Movie Manji""","[6, 9]","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 1 gives the intense feeling of a world that is dangerous. And being that I have grown up with Harry, Hermoine, and Ron, I feel for them as I would for a family member. There are true scenes of terror in this latest movie, and the music can be very alarming. I got the feeling I was watching a well done political thriller at times. This movie is almost entirely about the characters that we love most: Harry, Hermoine, and Ron. In my opinion some of the best acting of the franchise is displayed in this excellent movie.The Deathly Hallows was almost painful for me to watch though, as I have grown up with these characters and I care for them all so much. Harry, Hermoine, and Ron are still young, but the cruel world throws them out into the fire where anything may meet them! They are hiding, scared, and alone from powerful forces bent on their deaths. Everything they love is in peril, or has fallen and nobody can be trusted outside of themselves. The thoughts of the loved ones left behind drive them to stay up all night thinking about them in unconsolible agony. The three camp in woods, with only enough supplies to survive, and in places little traveled by people. Each wearing thinner daily by the impossible burden of perhaps being the last hope.The warm guidance and protection of those that love them are ALL gone except in memory. It is up to them, with barely enough knowledge to suffice, and definately not enough experience! And it drives me to worrying fits, because I don't know what's going to happen to these kids. I have refrained myself from reading the novels until I have seen all the movies. I have kept myself from overhearing anything about the books, and now I am in complete mystery, and it thrills me, but also it holds me in agony at times. I was reminded how young these guys still are when Hermoine was crying like a child. I wanted to protect her and kill the people who harmed her! You forget how young the characters are because of how grim, and aged they behave at times.It is not only their world that is in peril, but the world that I have come to know extensively, and that I have appreciated, and held in my imagination with awe and wonder. It seems every new movie had been a slow death of that world. A piece of it would die and not return. There are real consequences in this world, though it be fantasy, it is filled with real moments of loss. Every scene is weighted down with danger. Every corner is dangerous, and may have some terrible consequence. Terrible thoughts went through my head; and there were times when I had lost hope. I can't remember when I watched a movie with such emotional responses.This is a movie that I instantly loved, and will watch many, many times. I am convinced that the end movie will be historic.

The movie is by and large quite faithful to the book. This is both good and bad. The good obviously means that a great book is brought to the screen. The bad means that the pacing has to be very fast in order to preserve the structure of the book. This means that anyone not familiar with the book might have quite the task keeping pace as plot developments come at the viewer thick and fast.2. Our three stalwarts, portrayed by Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson, are on their own for much of the film with no supporting cast to help carry the load. They all do a fine job. The Potter series was truly fortunate when these three were cast.3. The film really can't stand on its own nor is it supposed to. It does try to come to a climax of sort and succeeds more or less but no viewer can possibly be satisfied with it. I recommend waiting to watch this until Part 2 is in hand to avoid frustration.Highly recommended. The Potter series has maintained high standards throughout.

He got their best performances yet from the three stars, there was a little more humor than in the book (very welcome) and the outdoor locations were imaginative and in some cases majestic. All the vital plot ingredients were there to prepare viewers for the grand finale in part 2. Having said that, I found this an unsatisfying movie just because I wanted to see Part 2 immediately, not in 8 months' time. It's not that I don't know what happens, it's just that the first part of the movie resolves nothing. Once we see Part 2, it will be possible to pass a judgement on the whole. This instalment was good, but rather like trying to rate a meal when all you've had is the appetizer.A warning: as is apparent from other reviews, this movie even more than the others relies on the viewer knowing the story in some detail before watching it.

1240799,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B001UV4XHY,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[0, 0]","2010's Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is the beginning of the end for this franchise, which began nine years ago with the cinematic adaptation of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. I must admit that while I'm a Harry Potter fan, I'm not quite a Harry Potter fanboy. I read the first five books and enjoyed them immensely, but didn't read the last two. It's no fault of the series that I neglected to do so, merely my lack of drive to do so. I have seen all six of the previous films, each in the year of their release and only once. I know that Harry Potter fans can be hard to please, especially when it comes to Hollywood adapting their sacred text. It seems no matter how faithful the screenwriters stick to the story, there is always room for error here. With that in mind, I am only at liberty to discuss this as a standalone film; not bothering to compare it to the previous films nor discuss how it differs from the novels. What I can tell you, and it should come as no surprise, is that Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 functions as a film in context with the other books/movies. If you have not seen any of the previous films, don't bother seeing this one. If you've skipped a couple films or a couple books, but are familiar enough with the ones you've skipped, you may find this film mostly enjoyable...But I recommend having as much knowledge as possible before watching this; I admit even I was unable to catch a few references throughout.In describing the plot, not that the plot or anyone involved in it need introduction, I'll be careful not to offend the spoiler police. Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) is gaining power throughout the Wizarding and Muggle worlds, and Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is in far greater danger than he ever imagined. With Voldemort in constant pursuit of him, Harry and his friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) must locate the remaining Horcruxes (powerful objects in which Voldemort has hidden fragments of his soul) in order to eventually destroy the Dark Lord.The excitement level of this entry rarely lets up and the film is very fast paced, but what's remarkable is that there's an actual plot behind the action and part one isn't just an introduction to the epic battle that will likely take place in part two. While most Hollywood productions begin to drone on and get lazy by the second installment (sometimes after a lazy first installment), the Harry Potter films, seven films in, continues to thrive and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 may be one of the strongest entries in the series. I can say without a doubt that it's better than the sixth film.This film is such a strong entry in part because it works on levels of story, adventure, character, and plot. I initially found the decision to split the book into two films a way for the studio to milk this franchise for every last dime, but I concede that this was a great idea. It allows the filmmakers to finish this tale without sacrificing any of the necessary elements that have made people embrace these films. Here is a film, a Hollywood blockbuster no less that moves at a fast-pace yet continues to move, un-rushed, through the plot and develop its characters further. I think it's hard to deny the effect of a film when it elicits sympathy over an elf. Yes, for a movie about witchcraft and wizardry, there's a surprising amount of effective emotional cues throughout.All of the actors who have worked tirelessly for the last decade have really blossomed in their roles, particularly the three leads: Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson. They've grown into these characters and are completely convincing. Any doubt about their casting should be brushed away if it hasn't been already. Fiennes' performance as Voldemort is a particularly impressive feat, especially when one considers that the wrong actor could come off as completely ridiculous in this role. There's a lot of makeup and CGI involved in the physical creation of Voldemort and yet Fiennes makes him wholly believable and appropriately menacing. His performance is wonderfully realized, as Voldemort does come off as an incarnation of evil without becoming a computer-generated joke. Fiennes also adds a certain amount of pathos that I think few actors could muster. In addition, the actors all share a chemistry and on-screen bond that can only be acquired from knowing and working with their group for many years. Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson have been playing best friends for ten years and they're a believable group. Most of the 145 minutes of part one focuses on Harry, Ron, and Hermione's quest to find the Horcrux, leaving little room for other actors to really strut their stuff; but Alan Rickman (as Snape) continues to stand out as memorable, even with little screentime. Meanwhile, Dobby (played, in voice, by Toby Jones), the memorable house-elf, is adorable, making for effective comedic relief and lending the film one of its most surprisingly emotional moments.In addition to these various elements related to story, one can't ignore the high production value of this film. Yes, it has plenty of CGI (lending perfectly to the mystical aspect of the series), but it's also beautifully rendered with the world of the books lovingly recreated. Ten people are credited with various aspects of set design, production design, and art direction and their efforts set the movie-world of Harry Potter apart from everything else. Meanwhile, the cinematography by Eduardo Serra looks absolutely majestic.The Harry Potter films rarely get enough credit. Despite being extremely well-made, high-grossing films based on a beloved series of novels they're mostly grouped into the category of simple Hollywood blockbusters. While the previous entries in the series only exist in my mind as vague memories, I can say from this film and those small recollections of the previous films that these are high-quality films that deserve more attention than they've received. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is a fine film; an emotional, entertaining, and all-around terrific set-up for part two. It's a film that long-time fans of Harry Potter will not want to miss and new fans will want to get through the others to watch as soon as possible. It's worth the wait.GRADE: A-",5,"Fast-Paced, Entertaining, and Emotional - A Great Entry in This Great Franchise",1310947200,"07 18, 2011",2011,6317,"['2010', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Deathly', 'Hallows',

It's not that nothing happens - actually, Yates manages to include all of the action sequences from the first 500 pages of the novel (the escape from Privet Drive, the aftermath of the wedding, the visit to Godric's Hollow, the incident at Luna's house, the Gringotts break-in, etc.).  But it all feels somewhat like a series of disconnected scenes cobbled together with too much talking, whining, and camping in between.  Like the book, the film focuses almost exclusively on our trio of teenage heroes as they try to track down and destroy a series of Horcruxes (magical objects containing segmented parts of Voldemort's soul) while at the same time avoiding detection and capture by followers of the Dark Lord.  Unfortunately, an awful lot of exciting-sounding things are happening to the characters who are NOT Harry, Ron, and Hermione, but neither the book nor the film lets us experience any of them.  And these other characters are sorely missed.There is so much sheer plot in this movie that it's difficult to keep up with it - there are so many things we need to understand to make sense of it all (the mythology of Horcruxes, the meaning of the titular Deathly Hallows, convoluted wand lore . . . and how they all play into the mission to bring down Voldemort and save the world for Wizards and Muggles alike).  And none of it goes anywhere in this film.  The final film will probably be more satisfying, since it actually has an ending . . . `Part I' does not.Several characters die in `Part I' - only one of them generates the kind of pain I expected (and as we see in the novel).  If anything, Yates sacrificed the emotional heart of the story in trying to stay so close to the overriding plot, probably the result of breaking the novel into two parts.  The pay-off will come in `Part II,' so it may all come together fine in the end.  Actually, Yates has a chance to improve on the novel in this final film - Rowling left us hanging a bit with her final few chapters (no Harry/Snape resolution, no Harry/Ginny reunion, no sense of the aftermath of that final battle at Hogwarts).  The `Part II' trailers suggest that Yates may have understood this.  I hope so.If you love the Potter universe, you've undoubtedly already seen this film.  If you're just curious, watch the other movies first.  And wait until July 14 to watch `Part I' - then you can rush right out and see `Part II' on July 15.  Perhaps together the films will do what `Part I' can't do alone.One final note - I watched this on a standard DVD on a pretty ordinary and inexpensive TV, and I did not find the scenes excessively dark or difficult to see.  Since so many reviewers mentioned the poor quality of the ""transfer"" on the DVD, I'm not sure what this means.  I had no problems.",3,"As a set-up for 'Part II' it works; as a stand-alone film, not so much",1308355200,"06 18, 2011",2011,3269,"['others', 'have', 'said', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'Part', 'good', 'film', 'fans', '7th', 'book', 'David', 'Yates', 'faithful', 'novel', 'fault', 'perhaps', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'reading', 'JK', 'Rowling', 'final', 'book', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'satisfied', 'especially', 'Part', 'II', 'coming', 'theaters', 'just', 'few', 'weeks', '.As', 'stand-alone', 'film', 'however', 'Part', 'suffers', 'same', 'reason', 'Rowling', 'book', 'suffers', 'too', 'much', 'exposition', 'too', 'many', 'over-complicated', 'plot', 'threads', 'set', 'up', 'too', 'little', 'action', 'not', 'nothing', 'actually', 'manages', 'include', 'action', 'sequences', 'first', '500', 'pages', 'novel', 'escape', 'Privet', 'Drive', 'aftermath', 'wedding', 'visit', 'Godric', 'Hollow', 'incident', 'Luna', 'house', 'Gringotts', 'break-in', 'etc.', 'feels', 'somewhat', 'series', 'disconnected', 'scenes', 'cobbled', 'together', 'too', 'much', 'talking', 'whining', 'camping', 'book', 'film', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'trio', 'teenage', 'heroes', 'try', 'track', 'down', 'destroy', 'series', 'Horcruxes', 'magical', 'objects', 'containing', 'segmented', 'parts', 'Voldemort', 'soul', 'same', 'time', 'avoiding', 'detection', 'capture', 'followers', 'Dark', 'Lord', 'Unfortunately', 'awful', 'lot', 'exciting-sounding', 'things', 'are', 'happening', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'NOT', 'Harry', 'Ron', 'Hermione', 'book', 'film', 'experience', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'sorely', 'missed.There', 'so', 'much', 'sheer', 'plot', 'movie', 'difficult', 'keep', 'up', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'need', 'understand', 'make', 'sense', 'mythology', 'Horcruxes', 'meaning', 'titular', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'convoluted', 'wand', 'lore', 'how', 'play', 'mission', 'bring', 'down', 'Voldemort', 'save', 'world', 'Wizards', 'Muggles', 'alike', 'none', 'anywhere', 'film', 'final', 'film', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'more', 'satisfying', 'actually', 'ending', 'Part', 'not.Several', 'characters', 'die', 'Part', 'only', 'one', 'kind', 'pain', 'expected', 'see', 'novel', 'anything', 'sacrificed', 'emotional', 'heart', 'story', 'trying', 'stay', 'so', 'close', 'overriding', 'plot', 'probably', 'result', 'breaking', 'novel', 'two', 'parts', 'pay-off', 'will', 'come', 'Part', 'II', 'may', 'come', 'together', 'fine', 'end', 'Actually', 'chance', 'improve', 'novel', 'final', 'film', 'Rowling', 'left', 'hanging', 'bit', 'final', 'few', 'chapters', 'Harry/Snape', 'resolution', 'Harry/Ginny', 'reunion', 'sense', 'aftermath', 'final', 'battle', 'Hogwarts', 'Part', 'II', 'trailers', 'suggest', 'Yates', 'may', 'have', 'understood', 'hope', 'so.If', 'love', 'Potter', 'universe', ""'ve"", 'undoubtedly', 'already', 'seen', 'film', ""'re"", 'just', 'curious', 'watch', 'other', 'movies', 'first', 'wait', 'July', '14', 'watch', 'Part', 'then', 'can', 'rush', 'right', 'out', 'see', 'Part', 'II', 'July', '15', 'Perhaps', 'together', 'films', 'will', 'do', 'what', 'Part', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'alone.One', 'final', 'note', 'watched', 'standard', 'DVD', 'pretty', 'ordinary', 'inexpensive', 'TV', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'scenes', 'excessively', 'dark', 'difficult', 'see', 'so', 'many', 'reviewers', 'mentioned', 'poor', 'quality', 'transfer', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'had', 'problems']",N/A

Some of the sound effects do drown out the speech and you can't hear what's being said, but you get the gist. This movie is fast-paced, and is full of action and mystery.

1240807,A28OB1QLXN5BM6,B001UV4XHY,"Karen Joan ""Siren""","[5, 8]","I was lucky enough to see HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 1 with three generations of Harry Potter fans:  my mother, my sister, and my 18 year old nephew (who shall remain nameless since he deigned to be seen in public with three older women in his family!).  All four of us really, really enjoyed the film, and we had a great time discussing it afterwards.  All of us agreed that HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 1 is the best adaptation, truest to the novel, in quite sometime.HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 1 is the first part of the final Harry Potter novel of the same name.  The Death Eaters are taking over, and Volemort is back in power.  The wizarding world is still reeling from the death of Dumbledore, and Harry Potter is essentially public enemy number one.  Harry, Ron, and Hermione are on the run and looking the remaining horcruxes.  If Harry can destroy all the remaining horcuxes, he will finally have a chance of destroying Voldemort for good.My nephew stated that HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 1 is the best screen play adaptation of a Harry Potter novel to date, and the rest of my family agrees.  While none of us believe that you can go into this movie cold, without having read the books or seen the previous 6 films, we all agree that if you are a fan, you will love this movie.  This book was one of my favorites of the series, and the film version is right up there for me, too. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint continue to delight us as Harry, Hermione, Ron.  These actors perfectly portray these three beloved and endearing characters, and I, for one, can't imagine Harry, Hermione, and Ron any other way.  These kids have grown up on the screen, their talent developed and matured, and I have enjoyed their journey.  Rupert Grint is especially notable in his jelous, horcrux-induced rage, and the ""dream scene"" between Harry and Hermione is well done, and quite uncomfortable (as it should be).  Some of the scenery is stunning, as well as quite atmospheric.  The long shots of the deep woods and empty plains expertly conveyed a true sense of cold, longing, defeat, and loneliness.  The emotions of this film run high, as friends are injured and some die.  And of course, there is a cliff hanger ending, since this is only the first half of the final book.HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 1 does exactly what it needs to do:  whets our appetites for the final installments  I know I can't wait until July.  The final movie promises to be the best yet.Side note:  As we were driving to see HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 1, it occured to me that my nephew was about 9 years old when the first film openned, and now he is 18 and driving US to this film.  He and a whole generation of kids really have grown up with the Harry Potter books and movies.

1240818,A27P0MW8TE1JQP,B001UV4XHY,Kevin J. Loria,"[4, 8]","The beginning of the End: The first installment of the last HP novel is here... Easily the BEST of the film series adaptations. There was so much plot damage control to be done due to the copious story cuts on the previous films that it seemed impossible to make Deathly Hallows true to the text. But thanks to stretching this one to a 5 hour project and some character stacking rivaling a Dagwood sandwich, HP Vii part one, is a promising start.The cavalcade of cameos may make your head spin, but it serves to make Harry's story more whole and his quest to find and destroy Voldemort's splintered soul richer for it. Appearances i feared we would never have, like older Weasley brother Bill just in time for his wedding, and complete with werewolf scars. Another, belated introduction, new minster of magic Rufus Serimgeour, played Brilliantly by Bill Nighy (what a Doctor [Who] he would have made!) but oh so briefly, if only he had been in Order of the Phoenix. Also perfectly cast and missing from wayback, oily sneak thief Mundungus. The. Jar-Jar Binks of the wizarding world Dobby briefly returns. As does wandmaker Ollivander and goblin Griphook return. Dobby's appearance is much better than his first, although much impact is lost due to his absence from HP 4-6. But, as if to make up for this one of my favorite Dobby lines cut from Chamber of Secrets is sort of included in Hallows, ""Dobby never meant to kill, maim, ...but never kill.""Let's not forget our title character and his faithful sidekicks, Watson, Grint and Radcliffe each really comes into there own as actors here as Hermionie, Ron & Harry. Especially Grint's superbly-done jealous Horcrux-weary Ron. The rest of the wizard staples are there, if very briefly, A  few stolen moments w/ Ginny, a brief hint at (hopefully) heroic things to come from less homely Neville Longbottom.  The Muggle staples: the Dursleys, are on screen so briefly the point of the appearance is lost, really there isn't the closure of the text or the film series there at all.The effects as always are great, no glaring problems like, the centaurs & trolls of Sorcerer's Stone. The Opening chase from Privot Dr. is proof that the visuals are solid enough as are subtler moments like the raising of the Wedding tents. The music by Alexandre Desplat(composed Benjamin Button and Fantastic Mr. Fox) is pretty good but, sadly not any real substitute for Mr. John Williams.One nice touch to watch for is the retelling of the tale of the Deathly Hallows at Luna Lovegood's home accompanied by shadowpuppets via CGI, lovely and dynamic.Beautifully shot, plenty of interesting location work, perhaps the only disappointing aspect, other than the fact that we must wait for the big finish in July, is the lack of Hogwarts in the story... But, in my opinion, this only serves to strengthen the feeling of vulnerability and hopelessness of the state of things...

So far, I've been able to see the movie and then read the book and that works for me - I don't want any visions of anything in my own head to ruin the movie for me. Reading through some of these reviews, maybe I should have read this book first.But having said that, I really love this movie. The first time I saw it, to be honest, I was quite bored with all the camping scenes and could have done with some more of the wedding, instead. I didn't realize that Bill was marrying Fleur from the tri-wizard cup until the second time I saw it. And there's a tiny bit of conversation that gives the impression that Bill's now a werewolf himself and learning things from Lupin, who's going to become a father soon, at least that's what seems to be implied. Would have loved more info here!Also, I had forgotten some things that happened in the 'Half Blood Prince' and watched it closely before seeing the 'Deathly Hallows' the second time. Three of the characters looked the same to me, so that was confusing and I'm not sure why Mr Malfoy was acting so scared and timid around Voldemort when he'd always been so bold around him before. And I'm still holding out for Snape to turn out to be one of the good guys! And did we *really* lose Mad Eye? We didn't see him killed, maybe he's recuperating somewhere while we're all watching Harry and Hermione camping? No idea.The humor in this film is excellent, I didn't really think there would be much to laugh at in this installment. The scene with all the Harry's was hysterical, then George with the toothbrush stuck in his ear, that guy just has to stand there wearing that goofy expression and it's hilarious. Then comes the polyjuice potion. The guy playing Harry was absolutely perfect with his expressions and body movement, it cracked me up just seeing him turn and walk away.And the ultimate sign of a great movie is when the entire audience says 'ahhhhhhhhhh!!!' when it's over, everyone wants to see more!",5,Better the second time!,1290816000,"11 27, 2010",2010,2004,"[""'m"", 'one', 'who', ""n't"", 'yet', 'read', 'book', 'So', 'far', ""'ve"", 'been', 'able', 'see', 'movie', 'then', 'read', 'book', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'visions', 'anything', 'own', 'head', 'ruin', 'movie', 'Reading', 'reviews', 'maybe', 'should', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'first.But', 'having', 'said', 'really', 'love', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'be', 'honest', 'was', 'quite', 'bored', 'camping', 'scenes', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'more', 'wedding', 'instead', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'Bill', 'was', 'marrying', 'Fleur', 'tri-wizard', 'cup', 'second', 'time', 'saw', 'tiny', 'bit', 'conversation', 'impression', 'Bill', 'now', 'werewolf', 'learning', 'things', 'Lupin', 'who', 'going', 'become', 'father', 'soon', 'least', 'what', 'be', 'implied', 'Would', 'have', 'loved', 'more', 'info', 'here', 'Also', 'had', 'forgotten', 'things', 'happened', ""'Half"", 'Blood', 'Prince', 'watched', 'closely', 'seeing', ""'Deathly"", 'Hallows', 'second', 'time', 'Three', 'characters', 'looked', 'same', 'was', 'confusing', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'Mr', 'Malfoy', 'was', 'acting', 'so', 'scared', 'timid', 'around', 'Voldemort', 'when', ""'d"", 'always', 'been', 'so', 'bold', 'before', ""'m"", 'still', 'holding', 'out', 'Snape', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'one', 'good', 'guys', 'did', '*really*', 'lose', 'Mad', 'Eye', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'killed', 'maybe', 'recuperating', 'somewhere', ""'re"", 'watching', 'Harry', 'Hermione', 'camping', 'No', 'idea.The', 'humor', 'film', 'excellent', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'laugh', 'installment', 'scene', 'Harry', 'was', 'hysterical', 'then', 'George', 'toothbrush', 'stuck', 'ear', 'guy', 'just', 'stand', 'there', 'wearing', 'goofy', 'expression', 'hilarious', 'Then', 'polyjuice', 'potion', 'guy', 'playing', 'Harry', 'was', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'expressions', 'body', 'movement', 'cracked', 'up', 'just', 'seeing', 'turn', 'walk', 'ultimate', 'sign', 'great', 'movie', 'when', 'entire', 'audience', ""'ahhhhhhhhhh"", 'when', 'over', 'everyone', 'see', 'more']",N/A

This is how the story goes: Harry, Ron and Hermione set out on their perilous mission to track down and destroy the secret to Voldemort's immortality and destruction -- the Horcruxes. On their own, without the guidance of their professors or the protection of Professor Dumbledore, the three friends must now rely on one another more than ever. But there are Dark Forces in their midst that threaten to tear them apart. Meanwhile, the wizarding world has become a dangerous place for all enemies of the Dark Lord. The long-feared war has begun and Voldemort's Death Eaters seize control of the Ministry of Magic and even Hogwarts, terrorizing and arresting anyone who might oppose them. But the one prize they still seek is the one most valuable to Voldemort: Harry Potter. The Chosen One has become the hunted one as the Death Eaters search for Harry with orders to bring him to Voldemort...alive. Harry's only hope is to find the Horcruxes before Voldemort finds him. But as he searches for clues, he uncovers an old and almost forgotten tale -- the legend of the Deathly Hallows. And if the legend turns out to be true, it could give Voldemort the ultimate power he seeks. Little does Harry know that his future has already been decided by his past when, on that fateful day, he became ""the Boy Who Lived.""

Their performances really blew me away-watch Emma's performance when Ron gets splinched or her torture scene; watch Rupert's performance when he is all jealous of Harry and Hermione or his ""speech"". But the best is when Ron returns and Hermione is not exactly ""welcoming back with open arms"" ;) Their relationship was just fun to watch throughout the entire film and will be even more incredible to watch in part 2 as their relationship evolves further :) As for Dan Radcliffe-his highlighted moment was def 7 Potters!!! He was AMAZING there. Dan also does a great job of showing the emotional rollercoaster he is feeling about putting his best friends' lives in danger. As for the movie itself-the scenery was breathtaking, the writing incredible (*very true to the book), the acting superb-the trio, the older adult actors.

1240840,A3I41MF1O2FAC,B001UV4XHY,"Laura Merucci ""marspeach""","[1, 1]","The acting was outstanding. I've always felt Rupert Grint as Ron was the most natural of the trio but up until now he hasn't had much to work with, usually stuck as comic relief. Finally he got to show off more of his skill in some real dramatic moments. Emma Watson's Hermione was the weakest to me in the first five films, overacting and constantly wiggling her eyebrows. Thankfully she improved in HBP and got even better this time! I thought the two of them outshone Daniel Radcliffe as Harry, who was good, don't get me wrong. He just slightly paled in comparison to the other two. The supporting cast was equally good. Peter Mullan was very intimidating as Yaxley and even better than I imagined him in the book. Nick Moran's Scabior played a bigger role than in the book and was almost alluring in a really creepy way. Helena Bonham Carter's Bellatrix was a touch toned down from the previous films, which I was grateful for. I was also so glad we finally got to meet Bill Weasley and Mundungus Fletcher.The soundtrack was really good. I particularly loved Obliviated in the beginning because it caught my attention right away and Farewell to Dobby because it was so beautiful and moving. The cinematography was also excellent. I wasn't fond of the camping scenes in the book but I didn't mind them in the movie because of the gorgeous location shots! Nearly all of the individual scenes were well-done, with a perfect balance of drama, action, and comedy. My favorites were Hermione erasing her parents' memories and the silver doe. I was confused about the Harry/Hermione dance scene because I felt it was a bit out of character for Harry, but it was actually pretty cute.The film wasn't perfect. My two biggest complaints were the lack of explanation for the mirror shard and no use of the invisibility cloak. Since the cloak is one of the Hallows, wouldn't it have made sense to remind the non-hardcore audience about it? Similarly, those who haven't read the books will be scratching their heads trying to figure out where Harry got the mirror shard.I also felt Ginny was really a nonentity. Hers and Harry's romance was poorly treated in HBP as well and I was disappointed that it was more of the same this time.My other complaints are really minor quibbles in comparison. I missed seeing Dudley and Harry's handshake, even though the movie works perfectly fine without it. I would have liked to see Harry and Ron hug after the destruction of the locket and have Harry assure Ron that he only sees Hermione as a sister (especially since some viewers thought he was trying to come on to Hermione in the dance scene!). I also felt Malfoy Manor, while a nice scene in itself, paled in comparison to the book. It was slightly rushed and watered down- namely Ron's reaction and Wormtail's fate. I suppose this was done for a reason, and it does work in the movie- but the book scene was so much better.The end only made me want Part II right now!

Erickson ""Mommy Mystic""","[1, 1]","The 7th Harry Potter book marks a distinct shift in the series, as Dumbledore is dead, Harry and friends are no longer at Hogwarts, and the world is facing a dark future that only they can prevent. This film captures those shifts beautifully. Harry, Ron and Hermione are grown, and feeling the weight of the world on their shoulders. This is a somber film, so different from the first few, but very powerful. The director used the landscape beautifully in this film to convey the stark, dark feeling of this phase of their quest, and the impact of wearing the 2nd Horcrux. From dreary woods to desolate cliffs and beachsides, the settings are gorgeous, empty, and spooky. The three leads put in their best and subtlest performances to date - no more mugging for the camera. They convey both their deep affections and inner turmoils brilliantly. Dream sequences are gorgeous, and the animated telling of the story of the 3 brothers (the genesis of the deathly hallows of the title) is brilliant. I also loved the scene where Hermione and Harry briefly take off the Horcrux and dance - just a moment of joy before they reshoulder their burden.My only warning would be that this film will make no sense to someone not familiar with the books or other movies. While some of the past movies have been OK as standalones, this one requires prior knowledge of the story, and very little is offered as explanation for those that don't already know.

It is $19.--something and it has all the special features the combo pack has except the opening scene for DH part II which I don't find that big of a deal because the movie is coming out soon and the fact that you can get it in the combo pack means that there is a pretty good chance that it can be found on youtube or on the Harry Potter Facebook page.  So to all you people peeved by the DVD I say again go to Wal-mart. I did so last night and watched all the special features and the movie (the quality of the movie is even better--I don't know what WB is playing at).  I feel much better.Also I don't know if this will make you feel any better but I found out that for people with blu-ray they had to get the combo pack in order to see the special features.

After the first two in the series, I stopped going because it all became a bore and my sons both grew up and decided the HP movies stunk (which I agreed with). Yes, the kids in the movie are no longer kids and the movie does attempt to show the angst, temptations, jealousies, etc.... of teens BUT the movie is still a bore.  Maybe in the theaters it was better, but on TV, scenes look too dark and the special effects don't look too special.  As for character developments and acting - well the actors try do the best with the material but there is nothing noteworthy in any of their scenes and everything drags right up to the final scene. You can take this LONG movie, cut at least an hour out of it and not miss a single point the movie is trying to make - which isn't much.

I went to the theatre to see THBP and was seriously bored. There were some comical moments that got a few laughs from me and the audience at least. The problem was the whole thing was almost entirely focused on romance. Only the last few minutes do they show what Voldemort's crew are up to. And it was not much unfortunately. I heard the book had much more to them on the final scene of the movie.The Deathly Hallows Part 1 gets us back on track, where the Harry Potter series has been going. The best thing the previous Potter showed were the Horcrux's. I won't spoil what that's about, but Harry is on a quest to destroy these artifacts. Voldemort is around more this time. He has sent out his Death Eaters to infiltrate the Ministestry of Magic. Many laws are changed, especially against the muggels, the non-magic users.Bellatrix and a few other Death Eaters play a seprate roll from the infiltrators and that's to go capture Harry Potter. Hermoime and Ron stick very close to Harry, and not just out of friendship. Alastor, Hargrid, and many others try to use themselves to shield Harry from harm. Harry openly objects to everyone doing this. He cares a lot about his friends and mentors. The Death Eaters won't rest in this one. They actively are on the hunt for Harry.There is a big break from the constant action later on, which was needed eventually. I thought that provided good pacing in that way. At this point in the movie Harry is in hiding along with Hermoime and Ron. They help Harry on his quest to destroy the Horcrux's at the same time. The stress of the situation really does show with the three. Ron is scared and barely talks, he is on edge. He keeps listening to the radio of the take over from Voldemort. Harry gets very defensive to everyone. Hermoime is despressed, but deals with things not too badly in this nightmare scenario.This feels like half a story, well...because it is. That's why I couldn't give this one 5 stars. This is much more improved from the previous movie. The Deathly Hallows part 1 makes a nice setup for the second one coming this year. It'll be the last of the Harry Potter's, so this one is a definite watch to complete the whole story.",4,Harry Potter Vs Voldemort Soon Part 1,1306627200,"05 29, 2011",2011,2290,"['Harry', 'Potter', 'Deatly', 'Hallows', 'part', '1', 'much', 'bigger', 'improvement', 'Half', 'Blood', 'Prince', 'went', 'theatre', 'see', 'THBP', 'was', 'seriously', 'bored', 'were', 'comical', 'moments', 'got', 'few', 'laughs', 'audience', 'least', 'problem', 'was', 'whole', 'thing', 'was', 'almost', 'entirely', 'focused', 'romance', 'Only', 'last', 'few', 'minutes', 'do', 'show', 'what', 'Voldemort', 'crew', 'are', 'up', 'was', 'not', 'much', 'unfortunately', 'heard', 'book', 'had', 'much', 'more', 'final', 'scene', 'movie.The', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'Part', '1', 'back', 'track', 'where', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'series', 'been', 'going', 'best', 'thing', 'previous', 'Potter', 'showed', 'were', 'Horcrux', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'what', 'about', 'Harry', 'quest', 'destroy', 'artifacts', 'Voldemort', 'around', 'more', 'time', 'sent', 'out', 'Death', 'Eaters', 'infiltrate', 'Ministestry', 'Magic', 'Many', 'laws', 'are', 'changed', 'especially', 'muggels', 'non-magic', 'users.Bellatrix', 'few', 'other', 'Death', 'Eaters', 'play', 'seprate', 'roll', 'infiltrators', 'go', 'capture', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Hermoime', 'Ron', 'stick', 'very', 'close', 'Harry', 'not', 'just', 'friendship', 'Alastor', 'Hargrid', 'many', 'others', 'try', 'use', 'shield', 'Harry', 'harm', 'Harry', 'openly', 'everyone', 'doing', 'lot', 'friends', 'mentors', 'Death', 'Eaters', 'wo', ""n't"", 'rest', 'one', 'actively', 'are', 'hunt', 'Harry.There', 'big', 'break', 'constant', 'action', 'later', 'was', 'needed', 'eventually', 'thought', 'provided', 'good', 'pacing', 'way', 'point', 'movie', 'Harry', 'hiding', 'along', 'Hermoime', 'Ron', 'help', 'Harry', 'quest', 'destroy', 'Horcrux', 'same', 'time', 'stress', 'situation', 'really', 'show', 'three', 'Ron', 'scared', 'barely', 'talks', 'edge', 'listening', 'radio', 'take', 'Voldemort', 'Harry', 'very', 'defensive', 'everyone', 'Hermoime', 'despressed', 'deals', 'things', 'not', 'too', 'badly', 'nightmare', 'scenario.This', 'feels', 'story', 'well', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'give', 'one', '5', 'stars', 'much', 'more', 'improved', 'previous', 'movie', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'part', '1', 'nice', 'setup', 'second', 'one', 'coming', 'year', ""'ll"", 'be', 'last', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'one', 'definite', 'watch', 'complete', 'whole', 'story']",N/A

1240864,A8ZY9LI1KBU2P,B001UV4XHY,Mary Kate,"[710, 764]","I'm so very happy that I can recommend this one without any hesitation at all!The last couple Harry Potter films disappointed me in a myriad of ways. My disappointment didn't cause me to hate them, but I did feel let down and I have to admit that I found Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince pretty forgettable. But, being a Potter fan, I still found myself rushing out to see Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part I today. And to my great relief and happiness, I loved it - really loved it! Yeah!The chase of the Seven Potters by the Death Eaters and the trip to the Ministry of Magic are tense and exciting, the endless camping trip is just as effective at portraying the helplessness and frustration the characters are experiencing as it was in the book and the scene that gives us Hermione reading Beedle the Bard's ""Tale of the Three Brothers"" is riveting and wonderfully creative - much, much better than I would have thought it could be. We finally get to meet Bill (and Fleur's briefly-glimpsed wedding dress is gorgeous!) and the whipped cream on top of all this goodness is that the film is much more humorous than I expected. While not everything is included, of course, I didn't come out of this film grumbling things along the lines of ""How could they leave out _____?"" or ""Why did they add ________when it wasn't even in the danged book?"" - both comments I have been known to make after viewing some of the other films. Instead, I left the theater feeling like I'd seen a relatively faithful rendering of the ""real"" story. And there were even one or two things that I thought the film did better than the book, most notably the interruption of Harry & Ginny's kiss. The not-in-the-book added scene of Harry and Hermione dancing was both amusing and incredibly poignant - a true highlight of the film for me.For some reason, the enjoyment this film gave me seemed to lift some sort of weight off me - which seems a very odd thing to say, I know. I think it returned a good deal of the joy I found in the earlier films - when seeing the characters and the places come to life on the screen was so magical. (That first glimpse of Hogwarts!) In a way, I feel like I'm back *in* - that I'm once again immersed in the film version of the story in a way that more closely echoes the effect the books had on me. While the films, IMHO, can never hope to match the books, Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows, Part I, let me feel the magic again. For that I thank everyone involved with it.I thought the acting by Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson was better than it's been in any of the Potter films - they really seem to have come into their own here. Helena Bonham Carter was freakishly perfect as usual, Jason Isaacs very good and Rhys Ifans as Xenophilius Lovegood a welcome newcomer. The film sounds good - the score is a mood-setting addition to the film (especially effective, I thought, were the screeching radio sounds during many of the camping scenes) - and it looks even better. The shots of the English countryside are beautiful but often seem almost overwhelmingly empty and lonely - perfect for the story.When it was announced that Deathly Hallows would be split into two films, I was glad because I hoped that by doing so the filmmakers would be able to do justice to the complexities of Rowling's plot. And now, having seen Part I, I feel that they've succeeded in doing just that. After this, I can look forward to the last film, not with dread, but with pleasure. And I am incredibly thrilled to be able to say that.Very highly recommended!Some info and cautions on the products:PLEASE NOTE: Because there are reports of various versions of the DVD available from different sellers, I strongly suggest buyers check the packaging carefully to ensure the version they are considering contains everything they're looking for.I purchased the 3-Disc Blu-ray/DVD/Digital Copy Combo Pack offered here on Amazon.

The books are highly evolved AND involved, way too much content to try and cram into a cluster of a movie.  I thought movies 1-6 were incredibly done and I fought tooth and nail with ""real"" fans who thought they were so cool because they had read the books before the movies even came out and would bash everyone who liked the movies because the ""movies left too much out"".  But this movie, I will NOT defend in the same way.Why?  Because it is garbage made with one purpose and that is this: $$$.  Lets see how we can keep our costs low and our earning high.  I thought the purpose of splitting this story into 2 movies was so that it could be exceptionally detailed and leave it all on the floor for the finale.  This is the closer for freaking Harry Potter, both movies could have been 3-4 hours long and people would have never even blinked the whole time!  Don't say you couldn't do more because you didn't have the right time frame.The entire story is rushed.  Key events are left out (Krum and Harry's talk at the wedding, Kreature's major role, the insight to the Deathly Hallows) or changed, such as the scene with Wormtail.  That was an incredible part in the book, why did we just simply knock him out?!  It seems like the characters are uncomfortable with their lines and just trying to blurt them out as quickly as possible.  My heart was racing for the chase scene in the beginning but that was the most boring pile of crap I've ever seen!  When I read the Deathly Hallows and Hagrid fell from his broom, I was sure he was dead.  Everything pointed that direction, and when he was found to be alive, it was like the 2nd coming to me. But in this movie?  Oh no, lets cut that out so we can put Bill in here saying ""Hi, my name's Bill, I was attacked by a werewolf"", no better way of getting some back story than that huh?I bet Rowling is pissed.  Sources tell me she has a history of being unhappy with the movies, especially for downplaying the elves and after what they did to Kreature I'm sure she'd like to come down with the hammer of the gods.  Please I beg you before watching this, if you have not read the books READ THEM so people like me aren't having to sit there with a whole group of people and explain every freaking detail because the POS movie left out most every important fact that you need to know!Someone answer me this question, who was the cool looking snatcher guy with the long hair?  See, I read the book and I don't even know who that is!  Can someone please PLEASE reboot this movie?  Hell we are redoing Spider-Man, why not give a little more forethought into a work of literature that has pretty much been a major history mark for a generation?Did this movie really not deserve a little more thought and time?  Did we really have to rush it?  I will say that yes, there is a lot of downtime in the book that wouldn't have been interesting enough for movie scenes but come on!!! Part 2 better be the best movie ever made or then I will know for a FACT these movies were made with the all mighty dollar sign in eyes and I will forever lose faith in novel adaptations.This movie is OK for people who haven't read the books but I think even Potter fans that have never read a book in their life will notice this just isn't up to par.  I'm buying it simply to finish out my collection.

1240867,A1SC682D5FO0KC,B001UV4XHY,Matthew Schwarz,"[0, 1]","I've seen all the Potter films, and really like the early ones.  Much of what I like about them is the ""magic"" - colorful costumes, magical creatures, Hogwarts (both the setting and the school atmosphere), and John Williams fantastic musical score.  Unfortunately, most of that is missing here.  The kids are on the run, so the whole Hogwarts school setting is absent from this film, and instead they spend most of their time in a drab tent, camping in the drab wilderness, dressed in really drab muggle clothes, in drab lighting (the whole movie seems to take place on an overcast day - don't try watching this when the sun is coming through your windows, or you won't be able to see much of the film!).  Sadly, they don't have John Williams doing the music for this one, and the composer chooses not to utilize Williams's iconic themes from the previous movies, leaving an important connection to the feel of the series out, and the music doesn't do anything to create a magical Harry Potter atmosphere.  Another major part of my enjoyment of the early films was the friendship between the 3 main characters (although there were tensions at times).  In this film, the characters are pretty much uptight the whole film, and their relationships are strained.  Although I understand the significance to the plot, this makes watching the movie more tense than relaxing for me. Also, an important part of the film is to show the frustration and lack of progress of the book - the film succeeds in this enough, but, like my previous criticism, I don't find feeling frustrated and like nothing's getting anywhere to be my idea of ""good entertainment""!This is not to say this movie is terrible - just that I find it the least enjoyable of the series - it moves the plot along, and I'd certainly recommend it for someone working the way through the whole series, but I wouldn't recommend it as a stand-alone viewing experience.  On the bright side, there are plenty of good parts:  the initial scene where Harry leaves the Dursley house, the scene where they sneak into the Ministry of Magic, where they visit the Lovegoods' house, etc.  I guess, wherever they make it look like a magical world I enjoy it - I go to Harry Potter to see something different and magical, not to see the drabbest side of the everyday modern world; I can see that for free!",3,Harry Potter and the Emo Camping Trip,1326499200,"01 14, 2012",2012,2345,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'Potter', 'films', 'really', 'early', 'ones', 'Much', 'what', 'like', 'magic', 'colorful', 'costumes', 'magical', 'creatures', 'Hogwarts', 'setting', 'school', 'atmosphere', 'John', 'Williams', 'fantastic', 'musical', 'score', 'Unfortunately', 'most', 'missing', 'here', 'kids', 'are', 'run', 'whole', 'Hogwarts', 'school', 'setting', 'absent', 'film', 'instead', 'spend', 'most', 'time', 'drab', 'tent', 'camping', 'drab', 'wilderness', 'dressed', 'really', 'drab', 'muggle', 'clothes', 'drab', 'lighting', 'whole', 'movie', 'take', 'place', 'overcast', 'day', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'watching', 'when', 'sun', 'coming', 'windows', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'see', 'much', 'film', 'Sadly', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'John', 'Williams', 'doing', 'music', 'one', 'composer', 'not', 'utilize', 'Williams', 'iconic', 'themes', 'previous', 'movies', 'leaving', 'important', 'connection', 'feel', 'series', 'music', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'create', 'magical', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'atmosphere', 'major', 'part', 'enjoyment', 'early', 'films', 'was', 'friendship', '3', 'main', 'characters', 'were', 'tensions', 'times', 'film', 'characters', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'whole', 'film', 'relationships', 'are', 'strained', 'understand', 'significance', 'plot', 'watching', 'movie', 'more', 'tense', 'relaxing', 'Also', 'important', 'part', 'film', 'show', 'frustration', 'lack', 'progress', 'book', 'film', 'enough', 'previous', 'criticism', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'feeling', 'frustrated', 'nothing', 'getting', 'anywhere', 'be', 'idea', 'good', 'entertainment', 'not', 'say', 'movie', 'terrible', 'just', 'find', 'least', 'enjoyable', 'series', 'plot', ""'d"", 'certainly', 'recommend', 'someone', 'working', 'way', 'whole', 'series', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'stand-alone', 'viewing', 'experience', 'bright', 'side', 'are', 'plenty', 'good', 'parts', 'initial', 'scene', 'where', 'Harry', 'Dursley', 'house', 'scene', 'where', 'sneak', 'Ministry', 'Magic', 'where', 'visit', 'Lovegoods', 'house', 'etc', 'guess', 'wherever', 'make', 'look', 'magical', 'world', 'enjoy', 'go', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'see', 'something', 'different', 'magical', 'not', 'see', 'drabbest', 'side', 'everyday', 'modern', 'world', 'can', 'see', 'free']",N/A

Lol.I'll begin by commenting about the cover...you are drawn into the movie from the get go when you see this cover, like all good covers should do to you.what do we see? we see three trainee-wizards, each with a magic wand and one a girl called hermione, running through a wood. Harry Potter, the main character,wears something of a fearful expression on his handsome, slightly nerdy features, his eyes sleepy behind his infamous lenses. Ronald takes up the rear, also looking doubtful, as they sprint towards their destination. But little hermione,striding calmly at H.Potter's shoulder...there is a glint in her eye. The wand is like a sparkler in her gloved hand and her eyes are bright with purpose.And it is this sparkle, this explosion of destiny behind those dark, calm eyes, that is more or less the key to not just this Harry Potter movie, but every HP movie and indeed the whole philosophy and ethic of the shimmery, effervescent Rowling-conceived Universe.And now for the movie itself...well, its good. 'Harry Potter 2' good. Not since I first saw the little goblin guy Dobby that theyre friends with with the funny voice (Dobby) has my faith in this wonderful wonderful franchise felt so strong, to see this beautifully misunderstood creature return in such a moving way.Although Harry Potter is my favourite fictional character of all time, I shall stick my two hands up at this stage in the interview and admit that I'm not a massive fan of the Harry Potter stories:I've never read the books...(it's my firm decision to never read any books that have been adapted into films; they spoil the films because they're always way better (read 'Jaws' by Peter Benchley for a fruitful example of this)) so naturally Im not a massive admirer of the movie adaptations, but this was hands down my favourite of the 7.Having watched the Potter franchise develop from when I was a kid to now, I feel like I have grown up with my three good friends, Harry, Ronald Weasley and Hermione...And growing up never felt so damn good.",5,An American's review,1322697600,"12 1, 2011",2011,2175,"['Well', 'will', 'begin', 'interview', 'saying', 'NOT', 'say', 'charming', 'coming', 'age', 'tale', 'wonder', 'wizadry', 'groovy', 'groovy', 'times', 'Lol.I', ""'ll"", 'begin', 'commenting', 'cover', 'are', 'drawn', 'movie', 'get', 'go', 'when', 'see', 'cover', 'good', 'covers', 'should', 'do', 'you.what', 'do', 'see', 'see', 'three', 'trainee-wizards', 'magic', 'wand', 'one', 'girl', 'called', 'hermione', 'running', 'wood', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'main', 'character', 'something', 'fearful', 'expression', 'handsome', 'slightly', 'nerdy', 'features', 'eyes', 'sleepy', 'infamous', 'lenses', 'Ronald', 'up', 'rear', 'also', 'looking', 'doubtful', 'sprint', 'towards', 'destination', 'little', 'hermione', 'striding', 'calmly', 'H.Potter', 'shoulder', 'glint', 'eye', 'wand', 'sparkler', 'gloved', 'hand', 'eyes', 'are', 'bright', 'purpose.And', 'sparkle', 'explosion', 'destiny', 'dark', 'calm', 'eyes', 'more', 'less', 'key', 'not', 'just', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movie', 'HP', 'movie', 'indeed', 'whole', 'philosophy', 'ethic', 'shimmery', 'effervescent', 'Rowling-conceived', 'Universe.And', 'now', 'movie', 'well', 'good', ""'Harry"", 'Potter', '2', 'good', 'Not', 'first', 'saw', 'little', 'goblin', 'guy', 'Dobby', 'theyre', 'friends', 'funny', 'voice', 'Dobby', 'faith', 'wonderful', 'wonderful', 'franchise', 'felt', 'so', 'strong', 'see', 'beautifully', 'misunderstood', 'creature', 'return', 'such', 'moving', 'way.Although', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'favourite', 'fictional', 'character', 'time', 'shall', 'stick', 'two', 'up', 'stage', 'interview', 'admit', ""'m"", 'not', 'massive', 'fan', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'stories', ""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'books', 'firm', 'decision', 'never', 'read', 'books', 'have', 'been', 'adapted', 'films', 'spoil', 'films', ""'re"", 'always', 'way', 'better', 'read', ""'Jaws"", 'Peter', 'Benchley', 'fruitful', 'example', 'so', 'naturally', 'Im', 'not', 'massive', 'admirer', 'movie', 'adaptations', 'was', 'down', 'favourite', '7.Having', 'watched', 'Potter', 'franchise', 'develop', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'now', 'feel', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'three', 'good', 'friends', 'Harry', 'Ronald', 'Weasley', 'Hermione', 'growing', 'up', 'never', 'felt', 'so', 'damn', 'good']",N/A

The book chronicles Harry, Ron, and Hermione as they decide to abandon their final year of education at Hogwarts and set off on a quest to take down the evil Lord Voldemort. What begins as a search for Voldemort's horcruxes also turns into a hunt for the three mysterious Deathly Hallows, along with a struggle for survival.This is a very dark and intense film, and rightfully so, as the seventh book in the HP series is the most grim of all. The filmmakers got a lot of things right, but there were a few disappointments. (Note: a few spoilers are ahead.) I understand the need to omit material from movies to meet time requirements, and I even understand the desire to make small alterations so certain things translate better from page to screen. However, changing things just for the sake of changing them really irritates me. One thing that really disappointed me was the sequence where Harry is taken away from the Dursley residence, and a bunch of Harry Potters undergo an airborne attack by Death Eaters. That scene was way too short in the film, and for some reason half of it took place in the middle of a busy London street, which made no sense at all. Hedwig's death was also rewritten a bit, and in my opinion it happened way too fast and didn't do the poor owl justice. (At least the Dobby death scene was much better.)I also wasn't happy that the film added some scenes that weren't in the book at all. This takes away from an opportunity to showcase more of the original plot from the novel. Why, for instance, include that stupid scene with Harry and Hermione dancing in the tent and cut the Harry/Lupin fight that occurs in Grimmauld Place? Most of the scenes that were new to the movie easily could have been omitted in favor of Rowling's original material.In spite of those shortcomings, however. this is truly an excellent film. It was made for fans of the books, so critics who blast the film for being too long and dragging in the beginning obviously have no idea what they're talking about. The cast is amazing, the effects are phenomenal, and you REALLY need to see this movie in the theatre. I cannot wait to see the final movie next spring.",4,"A few flaws, but overall a fantastic film",1290211200,"11 20, 2010",2010,2656,"['die-hard', 'fan', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'books', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'few', 'things', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better.The', 'best', 'thing', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'producers', 'were', 'smart', 'enough', 'split', 'final', 'installment', 'J.K.', 'Rowling', 'brilliant', 'wizard', 'saga', 'two', 'films', 'result', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'content', 'book', 'was', 'cut', 'Part', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'been', 'case', 'other', 'HP', 'movies', 'book', 'Harry', 'Ron', 'Hermione', 'decide', 'abandon', 'final', 'year', 'education', 'Hogwarts', 'set', 'off', 'quest', 'take', 'down', 'evil', 'Lord', 'Voldemort', 'What', 'search', 'Voldemort', 'horcruxes', 'also', 'hunt', 'three', 'mysterious', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'struggle', 'survival.This', 'very', 'dark', 'intense', 'film', 'rightfully', 'so', 'seventh', 'book', 'HP', 'series', 'most', 'grim', 'filmmakers', 'got', 'lot', 'things', 'right', 'were', 'few', 'disappointments', 'Note', 'few', 'spoilers', 'are', 'ahead', 'understand', 'need', 'omit', 'material', 'movies', 'meet', 'time', 'requirements', 'even', 'understand', 'desire', 'make', 'small', 'alterations', 'so', 'certain', 'things', 'translate', 'better', 'page', 'screen', 'However', 'changing', 'things', 'just', 'sake', 'changing', 'really', 'One', 'thing', 'really', 'disappointed', 'was', 'sequence', 'where', 'Harry', 'taken', 'away', 'Dursley', 'residence', 'bunch', 'Harry', 'Potters', 'undergo', 'airborne', 'attack', 'Death', 'Eaters', 'scene', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'short', 'film', 'reason', 'half', 'took', 'place', 'middle', 'busy', 'London', 'street', 'made', 'sense', 'Hedwig', 'death', 'was', 'also', 'bit', 'opinion', 'happened', 'way', 'too', 'fast', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'poor', 'owl', 'justice', 'least', 'Dobby', 'death', 'scene', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'also', 'was', ""n't"", 'happy', 'film', 'added', 'scenes', 'were', ""n't"", 'book', 'away', 'opportunity', 'showcase', 'more', 'original', 'plot', 'novel', 'Why', 'instance', 'include', 'stupid', 'scene', 'Harry', 'Hermione', 'dancing', 'tent', 'cut', 'Harry/Lupin', 'fight', 'Grimmauld', 'Place', 'Most', 'scenes', 'were', 'new', 'movie', 'easily', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'omitted', 'favor', 'Rowling', 'original', 'material.In', 'spite', 'shortcomings', 'however', 'truly', 'excellent', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'fans', 'books', 'critics', 'who', 'blast', 'film', 'being', 'too', 'long', 'dragging', 'beginning', 'obviously', 'have', 'idea', 'what', ""'re"", 'talking', 'cast', 'amazing', 'effects', 'are', 'phenomenal', 'REALLY', 'need', 'see', 'movie', 'theatre', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'see', 'final', 'movie', 'next', 'spring']",N/A

Much Like with the Book Deathly hallows,this movie shows a different side of Harry Potter. With Harry and Hermione on the road hunting Horcruxes and learning about the Deathly Hallows,this movie takes place away from Hogwarts and that really gives the movie a feeling of freshness,a wonderful achievement for the 7th movie in a series. I liked how,in the movie,they actually SHOW the scene of Hermione modifying her parents memories instead of just mentioning it in passing. Very poignant scene that also gives a feeling for the magnitude of the situation. And the Voldemort meeting at the start of the movie is exceptionally well done. My favorite part of the movie,though,was the Tale of the Three Brothers. The animation of the Tale of the Three Brothers was just PERFECT! I had wondered how they were going to handle that part and it turned out to be one of the most satisfying parts of the whole movie. I especially liked the portrayal of death himself. It was bloody brilliant. The emotional side worked well as well. I like the fact that,in the movie,Harry does NOT use Polyjuice Potion when returning to Godric's Hallow. The godric's Hallow scenes,from the arrival,to the graves,to harry realizing he was standing in the very spot his parents had died,would not have worked as well cinematically if Polyjuice Juice Potion had been used. In the book it was fine,but,in the movie,not using Polyjuice Potion on Harry was the way to go. Those scenes were very moving. And the emotional climax hit home for me. In the books,the most emotional death for me apart from Dumbledore in HBP is Dobby. I cried twice watching this movie,1st when Dobby dies and 2nd when harry says ""I want to bury him,properly,without magic."" I've always admired the respect that Harry showed for Dobby in his death. I also think the best possible splitting point was picked. To end part 1 when Voldemort takes the Elder Wand was the perfect choice of a splitting spot. Splitting Deathly hallows into 2 movies was the right way to go.

The first time I watched this as a rental before Pt 2 was out I was not impressed, thought it was the least dynamic and interesting of the Potter films - kind of dull and flat, lack of plot elements as well as ""new scenery"" of the world created by Rowling. This is probably why it's so inexpensive even on blue ray. I must say I enjoy it more now on re-run.Bought this and Part 2 because of the upcoming ""blackout"" on Potter DVDs/broadcasts/streaming availability that is going to happen in 2012 and will last until Warner Bros. releases the new box set some time in 2012 or possibly even 2013.

""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1"" is the third Harry Potter film directed by David Yates, whose previous work was mostly in British television. Yates seems to have been charged with directing the young wizard's darker years. J.K. Rowling's tome of Year 7 would have benefited from much tighter editing, but, unlike the previous two volumes, the filmmakers did not decide to correct this flaw for the silver screen. ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"" is being presented as two installments on film. This is its only serious flaw. It could, or should, have skipped some of the wizard trio's camping adventures to create one, more focused three-hour film.The film begins on a dark note, literally. The Minister of Magic (Bill Nighy) announces, ""These are dark times,"" and the headlines of The Daily Prophet scream, ""Dark Mark Sparks Panic."" Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) erases herself from her parents' memories, and The Order of the Phoenix prepares to escort Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) to a safe house under deep cover. But Prof. Severus Snape (Alan Rickman) betrays their plans to Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes). Even the rare festivities of Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour's wedding are interrupted by the death of the Minster of Magic and an attack of Death Eaters. Harry, Hermione, and Ron (Rupert Grint) are forced to flee. The only way to save the world from Voldemort's wrath is to find and destroy the remaining horcruxes that preserve his soul.There is an oddity in the tone of ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"". It gives the impression that all of the necessary information won't fit in the film, yet there is a lot of storyline that could have been cut out to make the film stronger. Too much included, while at the same time not enough is explained. True to the book, however, the film does not shy away from the realities of a fanatically oppressive faction coming to power in the wizarding world: persecution, torture, and death. And a lot of dark imagery. This might be too frightening for Harry Potter's youngest fans. The level of mayhem probably qualifies it as an action movie. The film is generally entertaining, if meandering in parts. I found the animation that illustrates the pivotal ""Tale of the Three Brothers"", as found in ""The Tales of Beedle the Bard"", particularly effective.",4,"Probably Should Not Have Split Year 7 into Two Films, but Entertaining Nonetheless.",1305072000,"05 11, 2011",2011,2482,"['producers', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'film', 'franchise', 'seem', 'have', 'given', 'up', 'using', 'different', 'director', 'unique', 'style', 'episode', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'Part', '1', 'third', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'film', 'directed', 'David', 'Yates', 'previous', 'work', 'was', 'mostly', 'British', 'television', 'have', 'been', 'charged', 'directing', 'young', 'wizard', 'darker', 'years', 'J.K.', 'Rowling', 'tome', 'Year', '7', 'would', 'have', 'benefited', 'much', 'tighter', 'editing', 'previous', 'two', 'volumes', 'filmmakers', 'did', 'not', 'decide', 'correct', 'flaw', 'silver', 'screen', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'being', 'presented', 'two', 'installments', 'film', 'only', 'serious', 'flaw', 'could', 'should', 'have', 'skipped', 'wizard', 'trio', 'camping', 'adventures', 'create', 'one', 'more', 'focused', 'three-hour', 'film.The', 'film', 'dark', 'note', 'literally', 'Minister', 'Magic', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'are', 'dark', 'times', 'headlines', 'Daily', 'Prophet', 'scream', 'Dark', 'Mark', 'Sparks', 'Panic', 'Hermione', 'Granger', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'parents', 'memories', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'escort', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'safe', 'house', 'deep', 'cover', 'Prof.', 'Severus', 'Snape', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'plans', 'Lord', 'Voldemort', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'Even', 'rare', 'festivities', 'Bill', 'Weasley', 'Fleur', 'Delacour', 'wedding', 'are', 'interrupted', 'death', 'Minster', 'Magic', 'attack', 'Death', 'Eaters', 'Harry', 'Hermione', 'Ron', 'Rupert', 'Grint', 'are', 'forced', 'flee', 'only', 'way', 'save', 'world', 'Voldemort', 'wrath', 'find', 'destroy', 'remaining', 'horcruxes', 'preserve', 'soul.There', 'oddity', 'tone', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'impression', 'necessary', 'information', 'wo', ""n't"", 'fit', 'film', 'yet', 'lot', 'storyline', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'out', 'make', 'film', 'stronger', 'Too', 'much', 'included', 'same', 'time', 'not', 'enough', 'explained', 'True', 'book', 'however', 'film', 'not', 'shy', 'away', 'realities', 'fanatically', 'oppressive', 'faction', 'coming', 'power', 'wizarding', 'world', 'persecution', 'torture', 'death', 'lot', 'dark', 'imagery', 'might', 'be', 'too', 'frightening', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'youngest', 'fans', 'level', 'mayhem', 'probably', 'action', 'movie', 'film', 'generally', 'entertaining', 'meandering', 'parts', 'found', 'animation', 'pivotal', 'Tale', 'Three', 'Brothers', 'found', 'Tales', 'Beedle', 'Bard', 'particularly', 'effective']",N/A

Maybe it's just the source material, which I have yet to read, but while the stories have gotten darker (which I like), they have also become less interesting. I do understand that the innocence of the early films can't remain for the plot or characters to progress.Now, having said all that, I think Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is very well done. Sure there are some overlong sequences, too many characters forgotten about due to the huge cast, and I do miss seeing Hogwarts, but judging by the first half of the final chapter, it's going to end on a high note. The main trio have all grown as actors in more ways than one. All of the supporting players we've seen over the years are a welcome sight, but like I said before, often given too little to say or do.The CGI is impressive, yet not overdone, the music still remains gripping, but most important of all, I actually care about the characters and what lies in store for them in Deathly Hallows: Part 2.Here's my ranking of the seven films thus far...1.

1240904,A3T0OTH5072YRE,B001UV4XHY,"M. Reynard ""kairosdreaming""","[2, 3]","I've read all the books, seen all the movies (to date) and this one was good but definitely not the best of them.  I do have to confess that its been awhile since I read the book, but I was scratching my head through part of this movie trying to figure out where some of the scenes came from.  Whether this is from faulty memory or drastic changes from the book, I'm not quite sure.For those who are unfamiliar with the Harry Potter series, they should be read/watched in sequence without skipping around.  To do otherwise is to miss out on a lot of important plot details.  Its also important to note that the books have vastly more detail and help explain some things the movies do not so I recommend reading the books to help fill some of these holes in the movies.Harry Potter had lived with his aunt and uncle and their spoiled son when one day he discovers he is a wizard and can attend the magical school of Hogwarts.  Harry has a sad past though, his parents were killed by an evil wizard and throughout the books, that wizard keeps trying to come back and kill Harry.  This wizard, Voldemort, has finally regained power and taken over the world.  Harry, and his two friends Hermione and Ron set out to find the last of the Horcruxes, talismen that hold a part of Voldemort's soul and are the key to killing him once and for all.  Their journey is not easy, and they are pursued at every step, betrayed, and even injured.  In addition to this, they have to cope with their feelings for each other and maintain their friendship.Since it only covers half of the book, this movie largely focuses on Harry and the gang trying to find some of the horcruxes without going into any real battle.  There are a couple squirmishes so fighting is not totally ruled out in this movie.  The fighting can be brutal and may scare some younger viewers.  Some of the characters are just plain creepy as well.  Bellatrix especially, she gives me shivers.Ron really took a shining role in this movie.  He was witty and showed a wide range of emotion.  Hermione of course was her perfect self, but even she was allowed to fly off the handle a bit.  Harry was stoic and set upon his task, but I do think they could have given him a few more bits of happiness in the movie than they did.  Comic relief was far and few between in this dark movie.  Which is not necessarily bad, but could make the movie a bit heavy for some viewers.  The rest of the characters were all played well and very believable.  Its nice that they really tried to find the perfect person for each part and it makes the movie that much more relatable to the books.My only complaints with the movie are that some of the scenes were longer than necessary.  I realize character development is important, but after awhile, watching them trudge around with their tent got a little boring and I would have liked to see the pace pick up a bit or even some of those scenes cut.  Yes, the book may have had that as well, but movie going is a very different animal than book reading, and some things should be changed to reflect that.  In addition, I was also a bit disappointed they cut out the devlopment of Kreacher in the movie when he played such a huge role in the book.  It seems to me they could have had more of that and less of tent trudging.For the more technical aspects of the movie, the special effects and cinematography were great.  Even better than the previous movies in my opinion. I especially loved the tree outside the Lovegood's home. The music is always wonderful and really fit with the tone of the movie.It was a wonderful movie though and mostly faithful to the book.  I would take a guess that any fan of Harry Potter will probably enjoy this movie.  Now I just have to wait for the much anticipated finale.Review by M.

1240905,AMX4202M7D7HV,B001UV4XHY,"M. Secaur ""Meredith Secaur""","[5, 12]","Perhaps this stems from the fact that ""Deathly Hallows"" was kind of a bummer climax to a great book series, one that failed to meet my expectations as a fan, and failed to rank as 5-star reading, coming from an author that had astounded me in the past with her exceptionalism in the quality of her literary output. The novel was slow-moving, often dragging itself to a complete halt before starting itself up again on a lame footing, and then tumbling to an unexciting and open-ended finale.Not that I dislike the movie so much. It is merely that the film suffers solely from the problems of the book: an over-stretched and ridiculous plot (or lack thereof); a slow moving narrative, which took up over 700 pages when it easily could have used up only 300; and a ruthless extermination of nearly half the population of the Wizarding World in a single brutal sweep by Rowling herself. That being said, if you can disregard the seriously lacking storyline and nonexistent plot, ""Hallows, Part 1"" comes off as a fairly good film.I have really come to appreciate why the production team chose to split it into two halves. While the tone of the next film is ostensibly going to be full of more fast-paced, action-packed thrills with lots of heroics and explosions, this first part is slower moving, with a kind of stationary adventure taking place outside of Hogwarts, a first for the books and the films. It is easily the darkest of all the films, with bleak, somber scenery, and as dark a tale to match. The characters are more fully explored, particularly the three young heroes, and their depth adds another, more mature element to the story.Be prepared to shed a few tears, and to cover your eyes and your ears during some of the more horrific moments. I was especially creeped out by the scenes at Bathilda Bagshot's house, and the sequence of Bellatrix torturing Hermione at Malfoy Manor. The gristle and gore is quickly apparent, with frightening scenes of blood and death almost from the get-go (all courtesy of J.K. Rowling's book, I might add).  But considering the film was created by a team made up mostly of men and born from Rowling's imagination, I am thankful it wasn't any worse. While the same bad stuff happens, its been toned down to suit a PG-13 rating, and the gruesome shots never last more than a few seconds.You do have to give yourself time to get used to being out of your element--like the book, you never get to see Hogwarts castle. Being a ""road"" picture, most of the story takes place during what seems like an extended camping trip. The main focus is the three kids and their quest to destroy Voldemort's Horcruxes, though what they do accomplish in the stretch of two and a half hours is precious little. While an improvement from the book, I was surprised afterward how much time it took for so little to happen, even though it seemed like things were in constant motion. The action is spread over numerous campsites across the country, with bits of action, character development, and plot exposition thrown in. Not the most inspiring setting, but it works better in a movie than I thought it would.Regarding the script, Steven Kloves remained exceedingly faithful to J.K. Rowling's story, with the Deathly Hallows still taking front seat,  and everything else following, for better or worse. He is also equally as ruthless, sparing no one and leaving every death (all 6) in place that she put into what makes up the first installment. Even so, there are several changes which made for a great improvement to the plot. For instance, things move quicker leading up to the recovery of the first Horcrux. The pacing is shored up and sheared considerably from the book, where as I said before it dragged and dragged until it came to a complete halt. The film never stops moving, and often leaves you completely breathless. It is easily ten times more exciting than how it was written. To put it one way, I knew everything that was going to happen, yet I sat on the edge of my seat biting my nails the entire time. Little time is spent at either the Dursley's or the Burrow; Harry's birthday is completely skipped over; and Bill and Fleur's wedding is also condensed considerably. The time within Grimmauld place is robbed of screen-time but loaded with tension; the few moments inside are as nerve-wracking as any taking place in the forest outside.The strained relationship between Harry, Ron, and Hermione felt monotonous and after a while unbelievable in the book, but because the acting of the three stars is so strong, it works in the movie. Amongst the discord, there is a sense of unity between the three friends. Harry doesn't argue so much with the other two and is less belligerent. The fights between he and Ron have been paired down to one, and he seems to be more understanding of Hermione's feelings in particular, making their special bond even more poignant. I really enjoyed several moments where he finally stands up and acts like a man, particularly the sequence where he comforts a downtrodden Hermione by dancing with her, a nice addition by Kloves that wasn't in the original book.You can really see Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint coming into their own as actors. Watson is perhaps the best out of the three, carrying so many emotions at one time it's hard to keep up. Grint does an equally commendable job with Ron's conflicting emotions and his wavering faith in Harry, and often provides some well-timed comic relief. Radcliffe seems to be more comfortable in his role than the previous films, and as a consequence, Harry seems to have matured considerably, growing as a person and developing another layer of depth and complexity that adds even more interest to his character. For instance, after the face-off with Nagini at Godric's Hollow, Hermione shows Harry the bits of his broken wand. Instead of blowing up at her and acting like an ungrateful prig as he does in the book, he acts far more accepting, actually thanking her for saving their lives instead of bawling her out.Even though many, many technical advancement have been made since the earlier movies, I found the special effects for this one a bit too cartoonish. Dobby and Kreacher's faces looked far too human to be house-elves, and not quite as magical as in films 2 and 5. The shadow-puppet-like animation for tale of the Three Brothers was very odd, and I felt it detracted from the story too much.Of all of the alterations made to the plot, my one complaint was that Kloves chose not to spare Dobby, the poor, good-natured house-elf who gets mercilessly killed at Belltrix's hands, an unnecessary moment from the book that really galled me. In the film, it was painful to watch Harry call out to Hermione to help him, and watch as she does nothing. Rowling frequently contradicts herself, and this was one of the worst.  How is it Hermione could stop Ron from bleeding to death after he was splinched, or save Harry from a near-fatal snake bite, yet she can't help a house-elf that was wounded with an ordinary dagger? It would have been such an easy change--I really wish the film had ended better.As a movie, I can't complain. It had good acting, good cinematography, fairly good music, good visual effects, and a great production crew. It was a marked improvement from the book itself, and while maybe not as marked as I would have liked, it is nonetheless something I would consider re-viewing. If it lacks, it is in no way the fault of the filmmakers. They did the best they could with the material given to them. Let's just hope the next time around (Part 2), will improve upon the source instead of slavishly adhering to it.",3,"Latest Potter installment excites yet mildly disappoints, and fails to be the

It just kills me that Yates and Co. were brought back for the rest of the series.The director seems to think that a ""dark story"" means insufficient lighting in a film. This movie seems to be lit by candle light. You can't see the actors or the magnificent sets at all. The writing and direction is lackluster at best.I get it that things must be left out in order to make a book into a movie, story lines must be changed somewhat in order to do this, but there is no excuse for adding things that weren't in the book, while dropping important parts that were.  It is like the best parts of the book were changed or left out entirely, and all of the slower parts of the book were extended as far as they could go, and then extended some more.There are parts in the book could have been explored in more detail, which would have made this movie truer to form, and much more exciting. They have however, taken the vision and the promise of an extremely good book, cut out all of the pages, wrote a few chapters of their own, and sewn everything back in some haphazard manner. It is completely lacking in the qualities that made the book so good. The awful screenwriting seems to have taken it's toll even on the most talented actors, and the entirety of the film comes out as one drab mess. Director David Yates and his team seem to think that they can write the story better than J. K. Rowling...They should have hired someone out of high school to direct and write the screenplay, or better yet, stuck with Alfonso Cuaron (Prisoner Of Azkaban) and his team.

Doyle ""film buff""","[0, 0]","These hallows are not only ""deathly,"" they're ""darker than dark.""Your enjoyment of this fascinating installment in the Potter series will depend largely on how much you don't mind that the screen becomes darker than dark for many of the night scenes. It's the only flaw in the transfer of the film to DVD. Whether this is the fault of the original theatrical film, I don't know but the lighting technicians didn't account for correct light exposure, that's for sure.Other than that, the performances are all first-rate, especially those of DANIEL RADCLIFFE, EMMA WATSON and RUPERT GRINT, this time getting their main share of the spotlight in a story where the supporting players are strictly ""in support."" All three of them prove themselves capable of carrying the film on the strength of their own talent.Even names like MICHAEL GAMBON, BRENDAN GLEESON, ALAN RICKMAN, HELENA BONHAM CARTER and IMELDA STAUNTON have little to do as far as actual screen time is concerned. Carter's most impressive moments are obscured by the dark lighting employed in most of her scenes so that she is scarcely even recognizable.The story involves the quest of the three young Wizards to track down and destroy Voldemort's secret of immortality and destruction by finding the Horcruxes that threaten their survival. On the way, they leave the confines of Hogwarts and have to fend for themselves among all the forces Voldemort has sent to destroy them. We only get a few glimpses of RALPH FIENNES as the terrifying Voldemort, but it's enough to make you want to see the grand finale in Part 2 of this series.Summing up: Many of the ""dark"" scenes are too dark for eye comfort, but then the whole story has a dark atmosphere of brooding and impending evil about to erupt. Hopefully, the final installment will provide a satisfying conclusion to Harry's odyssey. The special effects are as clever as ever, particularly for the segment involving the seven Harry Potters.",4,"These hallows are darker than dark...deadly, but fascinating...",1322784000,"12 2, 2011",2011,1949,"['hallows', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'deathly', ""'re"", 'darker', 'dark', 'enjoyment', 'fascinating', 'installment', 'Potter', 'series', 'will', 'depend', 'largely', 'how', 'much', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'screen', 'darker', 'dark', 'many', 'night', 'scenes', 'only', 'flaw', 'transfer', 'film', 'DVD', 'fault', 'original', 'theatrical', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'lighting', 'technicians', 'did', ""n't"", 'account', 'correct', 'light', 'exposure', 'sure.Other', 'performances', 'are', 'first-rate', 'especially', 'DANIEL', 'RADCLIFFE', 'EMMA', 'WATSON', 'RUPERT', 'GRINT', 'time', 'getting', 'main', 'share', 'spotlight', 'story', 'where', 'supporting', 'players', 'are', 'strictly', 'support', 'three', 'prove', 'capable', 'carrying', 'film', 'strength', 'own', 'talent.Even', 'names', 'MICHAEL', 'GAMBON', 'BRENDAN', 'GLEESON', 'ALAN', 'RICKMAN', 'HELENA', 'BONHAM', 'CARTER', 'IMELDA', 'STAUNTON', 'have', 'little', 'do', 'as', 'far', 'actual', 'screen', 'time', 'concerned', 'Carter', 'most', 'impressive', 'moments', 'are', 'obscured', 'dark', 'lighting', 'employed', 'most', 'scenes', 'scarcely', 'even', 'recognizable.The', 'story', 'quest', 'three', 'young', 'Wizards', 'track', 'down', 'destroy', 'Voldemort', 'secret', 'immortality', 'destruction', 'finding', 'Horcruxes', 'threaten', 'survival', 'way', 'leave', 'confines', 'Hogwarts', 'have', 'fend', 'forces', 'Voldemort', 'sent', 'destroy', 'only', 'get', 'few', 'glimpses', 'RALPH', 'FIENNES', 'terrifying', 'Voldemort', 'enough', 'make', 'want', 'see', 'grand', 'finale', 'Part', '2', 'series.Summing', 'up', 'Many', 'dark', 'scenes', 'are', 'too', 'dark', 'eye', 'comfort', 'then', 'whole', 'story', 'dark', 'atmosphere', 'brooding', 'impending', 'evil', 'erupt', 'Hopefully', 'final', 'installment', 'will', 'provide', 'satisfying', 'conclusion', 'Harry', 'odyssey', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'as', 'clever', 'ever', 'particularly', 'segment', 'involving', 'seven', 'Harry', 'Potters']",N/A

This film is part action, part suspense, part drama, with a little comedy and romance thrown in.  There is magic, but not so much of it as to overwhelm the plot lines, of which there are several.  First is the quest of Harry and friends to find the Deathly Hollows.  Second is the relationship between Ron and Harry both over Hermione and with regards to each other.  Then comes the separate tragedies of the various wizards and muggles as they fall prey to Voldermort.  Last, but not least, is Voldermort himself, and his quest to find Harry Potter.  Mixed in is a very original and effective retelling of the Deathly Hallows story narrated by Hermione, some key deaths, and further insights into Dumbeldorf's past.

I read Deathly Hallows when it first came out but didn't remember much of it, and the movie did little to refresh my memory.Unfortunately, I rented it online, so there were no subtitles that would have helped me at least follow the fast, oftentimes whispered, mumbled or hissed dialogue. But even with subtitles, I doubt that the story would have been less confusing or more interesting.The flashback scenes (or whatever they were) were so fast and so short that most of them didn't make sense to me.The ""guards"" (or whatever they were) at the Ministry of Magic wore uniforms that were clearly inspired by the SS. Everybody else seemed to be in Muggle clothes. Why was nobody wearing robes? Wouldn't that have been part of Voldemort's cultural purification program?Why were Harry, Hermione and Ron Apparating around the country? What were they trying to accomplish? Did they think they would stumble across a Horcrux in the middle of a forest?What was up with that Bathilda Bagshot character at Godric's Hollow? Did she talk to Harry in Parseltongue? Shouldn't that have raised a red flag? Why was there no discussion between Harry and Hermione after Mrs. Bagshot turned into Nagini?I'm assuming the locket they were trying to destroy was Salazar Slytherin's, but was it ever explained in the movie?Why did Gryffindor's sword appear at the bottom of a lake, of all places? In the middle of winter, at that!What was the deal with the shining doe that led Harry to the sword? Who (or what) was it and where did it come from?Why did the friends not Apparate to safety when they were pursued by the bad guys (no idea who they were) in the forest?On a general note: 99% of the movie took place in poorly lit locations or at night, and I found the perpetual gloom annoying.The online video quality is not very good.

You gotta be original somehow.What's up with all the icky green?  In this movie, nice happy blues, reds, oranges and yellows are not allowed.  Everything must be black, white, brown, gray, or this pale, slightly blue green that's just all over the place.  Check out the cover of the box: those are the only colors you'll see in this movie.  The only exception is in this scene involving the snake Nagini, which was very jarring.  Color palettes do not exist in real life.The movie does seem too long while watching it at home.  In the theater, it didn't seem to drag so much.  Normally, the second time watching a movie seems to go quicker.  This felt longer.  I'll probably have to fast forward the camping sequence next time I watch it.It's a little sloppy since there are a few things which are left unexplained, for instance the broken piece of glass which seems to be showing (spoiler deleted) in it.  I guess if I had the books memorized, I'd know what was going on there.  Maybe they'll explain it in part II, but I don't have my hopes up.Okay, those are my main nit-picks.  It's PG-13, with a not-exactly-kinda-sorta nude scene, so it's not for little kids.My single disc DVD has ONLY the 5 following deleted scenes:- The Dursley House: Harry and Aunt Petunia As They Leave House- The Dursley House: Harry and Dudley Shake Hands- Ministry of Magic Lifts: Harry Tells Arthur He's Being Tracked- Tent: Trio Discusses Destroying The Locket- Montage: Ron and Hermione Skimming StonesAnd personally I'm glad these weren't in the theatrical version, as they would have slowed the movie down even further, and the Dudley handshake scene doesn't fit the emotional tone they're setting up.",5,"Dark, dark dark!",1303084800,"04 18, 2011",2011,1895,"['enjoyed', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'enjoyed', 'other', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movies', 'instead', 'going', 'good', 'points', 'other', '5', 'star', 'reviews', 'will', 'tell', ""'ll"", 'just', 'focus', 'negative', 'got', 'ta', 'be', 'original', 'somehow.What', 'up', 'icky', 'green', 'movie', 'nice', 'happy', 'blues', 'reds', 'oranges', 'yellows', 'are', 'not', 'allowed', 'Everything', 'must', 'be', 'black', 'white', 'brown', 'gray', 'pale', 'slightly', 'blue', 'green', 'just', 'place', 'Check', 'cover', 'box', 'are', 'only', 'colors', ""'ll"", 'see', 'movie', 'only', 'exception', 'scene', 'involving', 'snake', 'Nagini', 'was', 'very', 'jarring', 'Color', 'do', 'not', 'exist', 'real', 'life.The', 'movie', 'seem', 'too', 'long', 'watching', 'home', 'theater', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'drag', 'so', 'much', 'Normally', 'second', 'time', 'watching', 'movie', 'go', 'quicker', 'felt', 'longer', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'have', 'fast', 'forward', 'camping', 'sequence', 'next', 'time', 'watch', 'it.It', 'little', 'sloppy', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'are', 'left', 'unexplained', 'instance', 'broken', 'piece', 'glass', 'be', 'showing', 'spoiler', 'deleted', 'guess', 'had', 'books', 'memorized', ""'d"", 'know', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'Maybe', ""'ll"", 'explain', 'part', 'II', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'hopes', 'up.Okay', 'are', 'main', 'nit-picks', 'PG-13', 'not-exactly-kinda-sorta', 'nude', 'scene', 'not', 'little', 'kids.My', 'single', 'disc', 'DVD', 'ONLY', '5', 'following', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Dursley', 'House', 'Harry', 'Aunt', 'Petunia', 'Leave', 'House-', 'Dursley', 'House', 'Harry', 'Dudley', 'Shake', 'Hands-', 'Ministry', 'Magic', 'Lifts', 'Harry', 'Tells', 'Arthur', 'Being', 'Tracked-', 'Tent', 'Trio', 'Destroying', 'Locket-', 'Montage', 'Ron', 'Hermione', 'Skimming', 'StonesAnd', 'personally', ""'m"", 'glad', 'were', ""n't"", 'theatrical', 'version', 'would', 'have', 'slowed', 'movie', 'down', 'even', 'further', 'Dudley', 'handshake', 'scene', ""n't"", 'fit', 'emotional', 'tone', ""'re"", 'setting', 'up']",N/A

1240922,A12FLZREV32JOP,B001UV4XHY,Noelle Eiram,"[7, 10]","Though Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part One is a blockbuster about teenage wizards, the seventh in the Harry Potter series is more ambiguous and thematically relevant than many movies about adults. The plot will baffle those who have either not seen the previous film or read J. K. Rowling's bestselling books.The wicked Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) gathers his band of Death Eaters to create a world where muggles (non-magical humans) are subservient to wizards. Voldemort himself echoes Hitler's makeup in that he is half-muggle, and pamphlets strewn throughout the film (including one titled ""when muggles attack"") resemble Nazi propaganda.Meanwhile, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) abandon their final year at the magical school of Hogwarts to embark on a quest to destroy Voldemort. To do this, they must find six horcruxes, objects containing pieces of Voldemort's soul.Deathly Hallows: Part One, the second to last film, is more appropriate for teenagers than young children. From the barren scenery to the shuddering, downcast portrait of Harry on a wanted poster, a sense of despair pervades the atmosphere. As our three young heroes struggle with uncertainty, their friendship is put to the test.Seasoned British thespians including Bill Nighy and Helena Bonham Carter have little more than cameos, but most minor characters are well handled. Memorable roles include Alan Rickman's icy Snape, David Thewlis's kind werewolf Lupin (in human form), and Imelda Staunton's creepy interrogator Dolores Umbridge.Voldemort's hosts, Death Eaters Draco (Tom Felton) and Lucius Malfoy (Jason Isaacs), exemplify the crumbling upper class. Humiliated by Voldemort and lower-class thugs, the snobbish Malfoys discover how overturning the social order can negatively affect them.The odious but helpful house-elf Kreachure, a CGI creation, is marvelously voiced by Simon McBurney. The more heroic house-elf Dobby (Toby Jones) is less successful. He comes across as more cartoonish than inspiring.But the heart of this film is the trio. Due to the amount of material crammed into each movie, Hermione and Ron have often felt more like sidekicks than complete characters. Here their acting, especially Ms. Watson's, has improved and their conflicts are fleshed out.We see Hermione's sacrifice as she erases her muggle family's memories in order to protect them. One of the youngest and least powerful in a large family of strong wizards, Ron and his insecurities also emerge, as does his resentment about the relationship between the famous Harry and overachieving Hermione.Ron and Hermione's unspoken romance is humorous, frustrating, and sweet. While Hermione notes that she is ""always mad"" at Ron, she and Harry have a more harmonious and platonic connection. Their closeness is demonstrated in the film's most moving scene, when Harry dances with Hermione. Though not in the book, this moment of joy is a counterpoint to the darkness that takes up so much of the film, and the dance dissolves when they recall the complexity of their situation.The most creative part of the film, arguably of the entire series, is a curious but fascinating animation of The Tale of the Three Brothers. Nicely read by Ms. Watson, the story of Death's encounter with three brothers is grim, eerie, and hauntingly beautiful.The film is by no means perfect. It has its share of melodrama, and Alexandre Deslpat's usually lovely score can be laughably over-the-top. Long pauses prolong an already lengthy movie.

When it arrived in the mail yesterday from Amazon, I had to re-check the return address because I thought it was a bootleg copy that had been sent by mistake.  The sound and picture quality are sub-par as well.I learned from reading the comments to other one-star reviews here that the sort of DVD release we have come to expect for a Harry Potter film (two-discs, widescreen, etc.) is only available from Walmart. Had I known, I would not have wasted my money signing up for a pre-sale from Amazon. Unfortunately, I opened it, so I can't send it back.After watching it, I can say I am still not happy with the adaptation of this film from its source.  For all its length, it is dreadfully paced, seeming simultaneously rushed and draggy, and it has left out at least as many important themes and scenes as any of the earlier films.  Scenes are added willy-nilly, too, which is not in and of itself a crime, but only a crime when the tacky new material replaces the brilliant original.Steve Kloves is no J.K. Rowling, and should stop trying to ""improve"" on the better writer's work.******SPOILER AHEAD******The film cuts an important scene that is one of the first in the book, and that is the tete-a-tete between Harry and Dudley as the Dursleys depart from Privet Drive. That scene would have added so much more to the film in terms of character development than the film's made-up opening scene of Hermione erasing herself from her parents' photos and memories. Much has been made of that Hermione scene, but I was not impressed and thought it raised more questions than it answered. In the book, Hermione mentions in conversation how she transported her parents to Australia, changed their names, and wiped their memories clean of the idea they had ever had a daughter. In the movie, it seems that the parents remain in their English house. So what happens when the neighbors ask the Grangers about their daughter? Or did Hermione supposedly perform memory charms on all the neighbors, too? And how does simply wiping the parents' memories supposedly protect them -- or Hermione -- anyway; aren't they still vulnerable to Death Eaters who might want to hurt them in order to hurt Hermione, regardless of whether they remember her?I am tired of people going on about how this scene brought tears to their eyes. I am as sentimental as anyone can be, but I found the scene bogus.

Go to the redeem page through that link and then put in your code directly and that will hopefully work for you.

As far as the movie, enough has been said about the series this was just to help in case anyone else had issues with their digital copy.  IF for some reason you can't get the iTunes to unlock, try the windows version which would then open up under windows media player.

1240942,A2INCRDI6OWA4C,B001UV4XHY,Positive Reviewer,"[4, 7]","Having watched all of the previous Harry Potter movies and read all of the books I am not impressed with this movie.  The fist five movies were very good, but the Half Blood Prince and the Deathly Hallows felt very different.  The Deathly Hallows, Part 1 consisted of random scenes splashed together with seemingly no flow to it.  Coupled with Harry's (Daniel Radcliffe's) mediocre performance, this film is a mess.  With regards to the story, this is a very depressing time for Harry and his friends, but Radcliffe displayed almost no emotion during the entire film.  It's understandable that Harry and his friends would be a bit moody, but there was no passion in Harry's voice, especially for what he and his friends had sacrificed to find the horcruxes (Hermoine was on par and Ron was good as always though).  For example, when Harry was asked if it felt better to take one of the horcruxes from around his neck he quickly said to Hermione ""Loads.""  I didn't sense that his character felt any better for having it away from him because of how he delivered the line.  There was no weight to that scene, and that was not the only one.  Most of the time, Harry just sat there in uncomfortable silence when he was asked a question or spoken to.  I felt myself hoping the characters got through the scenes without messing up their lines.There was an awkward dancing scene along with awkward kissing scenes that added nothing to the film.  For example, Ginny shows up out of no where, Harry and her make out and then that's it...nothing else is spoken about their relationship or anything from the book.  Don't even get me started about the scene with the obviously computer generated half naked Hermoine and Harry walking toward Ron while he is trying to destroy the horcrux....weird!  Strange kissing scene ensues  My last upsetting issue was regarding the dark mood and some of the disturbing scenes (beware parents, I'm sure this movie will give the little ones nightmares - I will not let mine watch this one).  The dark mood is awkwardly peeled away at certain points to let in misplaced humor (noteably by Fred and George).  The Harry Potter series has lost it's fun feel and gone dark big time.  Not really a fan of that change, but I know the story has changed and things are not as they were.  Personally I blame Rowling locking herself up away from her family to write the final Harry Potter books (may or may not be true).  I heard that somewhere and I think that her isolation from her family didn't make for the best material for this book.This is not a bash Radcliffe session as there were others to blame.  Ultimately I blame the director as he could have made the scenes better, especially with transitioning them better.  While I am on the subject and bashing away, let me throw this in.  I say fire the current Harry and replace him with Frodo from Lord of the Rings for the final part 2.  It's easy to explain, Harry did a face changing spell that backfired and is now permanent.  Also, fire the director and get someone talented in there, not one of these dime a dozen ones.  That's my take and I hope you enjoyed it.",3,Just Okay,1304985600,"05 10, 2011",2011,3137,"['Having', 'watched', 'previous', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movies', 'read', 'books', 'am', 'not', 'impressed', 'movie', 'fist', 'five', 'movies', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'Half', 'Blood', 'Prince', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'felt', 'very', 'different', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'Part', '1', 'consisted', 'random', 'scenes', 'splashed', 'together', 'seemingly', 'flow', 'Coupled', 'Harry', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'mediocre', 'performance', 'film', 'mess', 'regards', 'story', 'very', 'depressing', 'time', 'Harry', 'friends', 'Radcliffe', 'displayed', 'almost', 'emotion', 'entire', 'film', 'understandable', 'Harry', 'friends', 'would', 'be', 'bit', 'moody', 'was', 'passion', 'Harry', 'voice', 'especially', 'what', 'friends', 'had', 'sacrificed', 'find', 'horcruxes', 'Hermoine', 'was', 'par', 'Ron', 'was', 'good', 'always', 'example', 'when', 'Harry', 'was', 'asked', 'felt', 'better', 'take', 'one', 'horcruxes', 'neck', 'quickly', 'said', 'Hermione', 'Loads', 'did', ""n't"", 'sense', 'character', 'felt', 'better', 'having', 'away', 'how', 'delivered', 'line', 'was', 'weight', 'scene', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'Most', 'time', 'Harry', 'just', 'sat', 'uncomfortable', 'silence', 'when', 'was', 'asked', 'question', 'spoken', 'felt', 'hoping', 'characters', 'got', 'scenes', 'messing', 'up', 'lines.There', 'was', 'awkward', 'dancing', 'scene', 'awkward', 'kissing', 'scenes', 'added', 'nothing', 'film', 'example', 'Ginny', 'up', 'where', 'Harry', 'make', 'out', 'then', 'nothing', 'else', 'spoken', 'relationship', 'anything', 'book', 'Do', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'started', 'scene', 'obviously', 'computer', 'generated', 'half', 'naked', 'Hermoine', 'Harry', 'walking', 'Ron', 'trying', 'destroy', 'horcrux', '.weird', 'Strange', 'kissing', 'scene', 'ensues', 'My', 'last', 'upsetting', 'issue', 'was', 'regarding', 'dark', 'mood', 'disturbing', 'scenes', 'beware', 'parents', ""'m"", 'sure', 'movie', 'will', 'give', 'little', 'ones', 'will', 'not', 'let', 'mine', 'watch', 'one', 'dark', 'mood', 'awkwardly', 'peeled', 'away', 'certain', 'points', 'let', 'misplaced', 'humor', 'noteably', 'Fred', 'George', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'series', 'lost', 'fun', 'feel', 'gone', 'dark', 'big', 'time', 'Not', 'really', 'fan', 'change', 'know', 'story', 'changed', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'were', 'Personally', 'blame', 'Rowling', 'locking', 'up', 'away', 'family', 'write', 'final', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'books', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'true', 'heard', 'somewhere', 'think', 'isolation', 'family', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'best', 'material', 'book.This', 'not', 'bash', 'Radcliffe', 'session', 'were', 'others', 'blame', 'Ultimately', 'blame', 'director', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'scenes', 'better', 'especially', 'transitioning', 'better', 'am', 'subject', 'bashing', 'away', 'let', 'throw', 'say', 'fire', 'current', 'Harry', 'replace', 'Frodo', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'final', 'part', '2', 'easy', 'explain', 'Harry', 'did', 'face', 'changing', 'spell', 'backfired', 'now', 'permanent', 'Also', 'fire', 'director', 'get', 'someone', 'talented', 'there', 'not', 'one', 'dime', 'dozen', 'ones', 'take', 'hope', 'enjoyed']",N/A

IMO, it's a long book, but David Yates did what he could and gave us a fairly solid adaptation. And so it goes, we're at the end of the movie series. It's not a pleasant feeling knowing that we're at the end, but it's been a hell of a ride! And dare I say it, Hallows part one is definitely the best film since Goblet of Fire!Of course, there was much controversy upon the news of the finale being split in two, and I'll admit I was one of the ""TWO movies? [...] that"" crowd, but after doing some thinking, I realized it's a long book and so much important stuff happens, so after all, it's only reasonable. And I waited. And waited. And then, the showtimes for opening night got released, and I found that it was playing in the new Canadian projection system AVX, with wall to wall screen, rocker seats and crystal clear image and sound. So I went after work, a week early too, to go get my ticket, and awaited opening day.Needless to say, this movie did not disappoint.I was surprised at the amount of material that was covered. It was more of 75% of the book in a 146-Minute movie, and so I was pleased. This movie is also startlingly different from the other ones too. As expected, and shown in the books, the dark level rose with every book, and as seen in the trailers, this would be the darkest and grittiest. And my friends, it is just that, and thankfully so too. This basically strips away the glossiness of the others and gives us a rough, gritty, raw, disturbing and depressing feel/visual palette.Also, I normally detest shaky camera, as it looks ridiculous, gives me a headache and looks like someone with Parkinson's shot it. But here, it was used in the best way possible!!!! It actually added to the raw feel of the film, and suited the movie's dark tones well too. I was actually floored at how well done the shaky camera was, and furthermore, just how well done the film was.In short, I walked out tickled pink and happy, because this is the Harry Potter I asked for, and I got. I am absolutely stoked for part two. Bravo, David Yates!

The pacing is leisurely, sometimes TOO leisurely, but the emotion is intense and there's a real sense of danger and crisis. The action sequences are explosive and scary, and some of the ""on the road"" scenes are breathlessly beautiful. Radcliffe, Grint and Watson all push their acting envelopes. Best moments: a heartbreaking dance between Harry and Hermione, the Godric's Hollow sequence, and the pursuit by the Snatchers. I wish director Yates had varied the blue-gray palette, but if you bring patience to the viewing, you'll have a rich experience.The Blu-Ray transfer looks good, and I was relieved to invoke English subtitles so I could comprehend what the characters were saying. Over the past decade, Radcliffe, Grint and Watson have gone from speaking in crystalline British syllables to mumbling unintelligibly.The extras follow the tradition of all the Potter DVDs--they're crap. Well, except for the Maximum Movie Mode version of the film, with many pop-ups and mini-documentaries. That's interesting. ""The Seven Harrys,"" showing how this special effect was accomplished, COULD have been informative but it's so quick and raggedly cut that it's of no help. ""On the green with Rupert, Tom, Oliver, and James"" features a quartet of Potter actors playing a round of golf and reminiscing about the series. Not enlightening (and you REALLY need the subtitles for this!).

It's not just ""the camping movie"".  Sure it was a bit more understated, but I thought it also showed off better than the other movies how far Radcliffe, Grint and Watson had come as actors.Visually, the movie was stunning. The muted tones were nice. The locations were incredible. Let's face it, the animation for the tale of the Deathly Hallows was frickin' awesome.

Get over it. I liked the tent scene w Harry and Hermione dancing.

1240969,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B001UV4XHY,RMurray847,"[1, 2]","As always, I must start my latest HARRY POTTER review by stating that I have never read any of the books and thus cannot weigh in on their faithfulness.  I enjoy the films, but have never enjoyed them so much that I want to read the books.  I've been okay with the every year or two 2.5 hour dose of Harry and his friends.DEATHLY HALLOWS PT. 1 is the first half of the final chapter in the saga (as virtually anyone who draws breath knows already).  And as the first 6 films can be said to be a build-up to the final chapter, this first part of that final chapter is a great deal of build-up with relatively little payoff. At least, from a pure plot perspective, not a lot fills up the 2.5 hours this time.But if you're interested in the relationships, particularly between Harry, Ron & Hermoine, this is a very satisfying chapter.  In fact, much of the film focuses almost exclusively on these three friends.  Hogwarts is not glimpsed at all, and many of the recurring characters we've grown to know over the course of the series are scarcely seen (Snape, for example, appears in only one scene) or missing altogether (no Maggie Smith at all).  The movie has a chilled, insular feeling to it.If you are unfamiliar with the basic story and plot of HARRY POTTER...I'm sorry, but I am not the best person to give you that kind of background.  Presumably, if you're interested in this film, you've got a familiarity with the story that has come before.  If not, you need to go back to the very first film and start there.  It would be a heck of a ride.In THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, we see that the world of magic is descending into a frightening political mess.  The Ministry of Magic is turning into a fascist state, and ""good"" wizards and witches the world over are in hiding and being hunted down.  It's a dangerous time for all.  And we also know that the evil Lord Voldemort is preparing to confront Harry and then move on to dominion over all.  Times are bleak, and the film is literally dark throughout.  In the early going, there are some ""funny"" moments (one in particular features all of Harry's friends drinking a potion to make them look like him...there are some priceless reactions), but for the most part, the film is grim.  Eventually, Harry and his two closest friends literally go into hiding from the rest of the world...traveling through desolate landscapes in search of a way to destroy a Horcrux (a talisman that holds, I think, a portion of the soul of Voldemort).  They also seek more Horcrux's...and other stuff too.  I'm unclear on some of this, because honestly, the details of what all Harry and his buddies are trying to accomplish seem somewhat vague to me.  I just kind of take their word for it.So as they run around the forest, or around lakes or other landscapes that look terribly windblown, these three face their own first truly adult arguments, hurt feelings, etc.  As you may know, Ron loves Hermoine.  Hermoine feels the same way, but hasn't worn those feelings on her sleeve...so when she and Harry appear to grow closer...Ron feels alienated.  He's never been the bright one or the magically adept one in his group; now he feels totally useless, resentful and hurt.  It's perhaps too simplistic to say they've got a love triangle going...their feelings are a bit more complicated than that, given all the external stress they're dealing with as well.  In these scenes, which are infused with the sadness of friendships that are losing their childlike innocence, the three young actors (Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson & Rupert Grint) do some of their best work ever.  This must come, at least partially, from the fact that these three kids have grown up together on the set of these movies.  They have an ease together that they never achieve when onscreen with other performers.  Many of the scenes have relatively little in the way of special effects going on.  It's just two or three kids, sitting in a tent, or in the woods, having whispered conversations.  Depending on how much you enjoy this series for the character development of Harry, Ron & Hermoine will determine how much you enjoy DEATHLY HALLOWS PT. 1.If I make the movie sound small and contained, there are some BIG scenes that take place in the wonderfully rendered Ministry of Magic that nicely remind us that money is no object when it comes to these films.  The movie isn't skimping...the story just seems to be drawing in a deep, slow breath in preparation for all hell breaking loose.I look forward to the final movie.  DEATHLY HALLOWS PT. 1 did a great job in building that anticipation (and contains a great final moment that practically makes you cry out at how badly you're left hanging).  It's not the greatest movie in the series (it's tough to say which film IS the greatest, but I might lean towards GOBLET OF FIRE, with it's wonderful mix of the grand, the comical and the scary), but

I think it may be one of, if not the best film in the franchise thus far.The choice to split the final story into two parts paid off; the details, nuances that cropped up throughout the film were all possible because the film had time to work them in.  Even things that might have escaped the notice of people who didn't read the books, they're there for those of us who did (i.e. Hermione's reference to perfume; the perfume Ron gave her for her birthday).  I also firmly believe that the kids, the stars (Radcliffe, Grint, Watson, Felton, etc.) have never given better performances.  They clearly handled this film (and, likely, its companion due out next year) with extreme care.  It shows, and I, for one, am grateful.I've heard several reviews that say the film is laden down with too much plot, too many devices, details and new information, but that's hardly its own fault; the book presents all of those things originally.  Yes, the book had more pages than the film has screen time, but considering how much the book introduces here in the home stretch, how many new things have to be incorporated and made known, it seemed to work well.  Things got cut, and things got altered, but in ways that worked and, in the end, leaves us with a film that is gripping and heartfelt.My full review (with my takes on the good, the bad and the ugly) can be found here: [...]",4,"""Absolutely Spiffing.""",1302393600,"04 10, 2011",2011,1457,"['want', 'make', 'clear', 'whole', 'film', 'was', 'think', 'success', 'think', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'not', 'best', 'film', 'franchise', 'thus', 'far.The', 'choice', 'split', 'final', 'story', 'two', 'parts', 'paid', 'off', 'details', 'nuances', 'cropped', 'up', 'film', 'were', 'possible', 'film', 'had', 'time', 'work', 'Even', 'things', 'might', 'have', 'escaped', 'notice', 'people', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'books', ""'re"", 'who', 'did', 'i.e', 'Hermione', 'reference', 'perfume', 'perfume', 'Ron', 'gave', 'birthday', 'also', 'firmly', 'believe', 'kids', 'stars', 'Radcliffe', 'Grint', 'Watson', 'Felton', 'etc', 'have', 'never', 'given', 'better', 'performances', 'clearly', 'handled', 'film', 'likely', 'companion', 'due', 'next', 'year', 'extreme', 'care', 'one', 'am', 'grateful.I', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'several', 'reviews', 'say', 'film', 'laden', 'down', 'too', 'much', 'plot', 'too', 'many', 'devices', 'details', 'new', 'information', 'hardly', 'own', 'fault', 'book', 'things', 'originally', 'Yes', 'book', 'had', 'more', 'pages', 'film', 'screen', 'time', 'considering', 'how', 'much', 'book', 'introduces', 'here', 'home', 'stretch', 'how', 'many', 'new', 'things', 'have', 'be', 'incorporated', 'made', 'known', 'seemed', 'work', 'well', 'Things', 'got', 'cut', 'things', 'got', 'altered', 'ways', 'worked', 'end', 'film', 'gripping', 'heartfelt.My', 'full', 'review', 'good', 'bad', 'ugly', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'here', '[', ']']",N/A

Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is running for his life from the evil Lord Voldemort, who's made it his life's mission to personally finish off the young lad, and the Ministry of Magic has been taken over by Death Eaters, who have begun a wave of persecution against all Muggle-born witches and wizards.For those who are diehard devotees of the ""Potter"" series and who have literally grown up with these characters, watching ""Deathly Hallows"" must feel a bit like going to the prom in the run-up to senior graduation (an apt comparison since Harry, Hermione and Ron are now all well into their adolescence with all the teen-drama and angst that that inevitably entails).  For those of us who are but casual observers of the tales, the movie feels muddled and poky, its storytelling much too esoteric and confusing and its pacing much too slow.  The latter may be attributed to the fact that this is only one-half of the story, with the promise of a tighter resolution to come in the final installment.

I'm a Science Fiction fan, way more than fantasy or the ""magic"" genre. But.HP was such a big deal, that I got the books on my Kindle, more to just find out what the big deal was, more than anything. And read them.

They are just not 100% true to the books. They can't be. You can't tell a 600 or 700 page book in 2 or 2.5 hours of screen time, you just can't.So, if we leave the ""authenticity"" issue to the side... this is another great film, in a series of great films.It really does, as all the Potter movies do, follow the basic story of the books. If you are an avid reader, you will see scenes you imagined in your head, acted out for you by the truly superb cast.But the films, by necessity, must be taken as a separate entity.This is another truly wonderful, excellent, superb addition to the Harry Potter film series.The one thing I really love is, the film makers, _knowing_ they would have to abridge and condense, are internally consistent with their version of Potter.I've become such a HP fan that I know the books well enough to, at least, go... ""Wait, wait, wait... we missed a scene, didn't we?"", or ""Wait, that didn't happen in the book, did it?"".But when you view the films and the books as separate entities... this film, as all the others, tells the true Harry Potter _story_ magnificently.All in all, I am, for myself, 100% thumbs up.",5,"As with all the Harry Potter movies, outstanding",1374105600,"07 18, 2013",2013,1754,"['OK', 'So', 'Here', 'are.I', 'started', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'phenomenon', 'quite', 'quite', 'late', 'Just', '6', 'months', 'so', 'ago', 'fact', ""'m"", 'Science', 'Fiction', 'fan', 'way', 'more', 'fantasy', 'magic', 'genre', 'But.HP', 'was', 'such', 'big', 'deal', 'got', 'books', 'Kindle', 'more', 'just', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'big', 'deal', 'was', 'more', 'anything', 'read', 'were', 'so', 'incredibly', 'good', 'fun', 'disturbing', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'had', 'also', 'see', 'movies.I', ""'ve"", 'actually', 'become', 'quite', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'fan.So', 'let', 'get', 'shall', 'have', 'understand', 'movies', 'need', 'be', 'evaluated', 'separately', 'books', 'are', 'just', 'not', '100', '%', 'true', 'books', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', '600', '700', 'page', 'book', '2', '2.5', 'hours', 'screen', 'time', 'just', ""can't.So"", 'leave', 'authenticity', 'issue', 'side', 'great', 'film', 'series', 'great', 'films.It', 'really', 'Potter', 'movies', 'do', 'follow', 'basic', 'story', 'books', 'are', 'avid', 'reader', 'will', 'see', 'scenes', 'imagined', 'head', 'acted', 'out', 'truly', 'superb', 'cast.But', 'films', 'necessity', 'must', 'be', 'taken', 'separate', 'entity.This', 'truly', 'wonderful', 'excellent', 'superb', 'addition', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'film', 'series.The', 'one', 'thing', 'really', 'love', 'film', 'makers', 'would', 'have', 'abridge', 'condense', 'are', 'internally', 'consistent', 'version', 'Potter.I', ""'ve"", 'become', 'HP', 'fan', 'know', 'books', 'well', 'enough', 'least', 'go', 'Wait', 'wait', 'wait', 'missed', 'scene', 'did', ""n't"", 'Wait', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'book', 'did', '.But', 'when', 'view', 'films', 'books', 'separate', 'entities', 'film', 'others', 'true', 'Harry', 'Potter', '_story_', 'magnificently.All', 'am', '100', '%', 'up']",N/A

Although a few things were cut out (such as the evil werewolf Greyback with the Snatchers or cutting out the Harry/Lupin fight in favor of a cute tent dancing scene with Hermione) the overall spirit of the film was faithful to the book.Director David Yates I feel did not make a great film with Order of the Phoenix but clearly redeemed himself in my eyes with this film.The film felt rushed at first. In the book there was more build-up with Uncle Vernon.  On the other hand, Harry's contemplation of the little stairway closet he used to live in, you can almost hear him say ""Wow, I've come a long way.""And indeed he has.  He wants no one to be hurt or injured and would rather go off on his trek on his own.  But Ron and Hermione will have none of it. and go Disapparating all over the English countryside with the Death Eaters hot on his tail.Several scenes they got right:  Ron's anger and jealousy with Harry and Hermione.  The Patronus doe to the lake where the sword of Gryffindor is laid.  The snake attack at Bagshot's place.And most amazingly, the great animation of the Three Brothers tale, as told by Hermione (and interrupted by Ron a couple times)!Nitpicking Follows!Several things I would have liked to have seen:  More of the elf Kreecher and his explanation of Regulus Black's switching of the Horcrux at the lake introduced in the previous film.  And in the book, Harry's disguised self at the Ministry of Magic enabled him to free many people from the dungeons of the Ministry but that didn't happen here.  And more of the radio -- there was a lot more going on with the radio broadcasts {Potter Watch}, like a Radio Free Wizard or something!Final Thoughts:I can see a person not having read the book might have some trouble with parts of the screenplay.  Reading the book clearly helps in filling in the gaps.  The snappy dialogue and the deep emotional investment by the audience is wrenching.  But the occasional humor (the tent scene) was cute.  And the soundtrack by the London Symphony Orchestra was superb.It's going to be a long wait to this summer!",5,Dark Wizards! ** minor spoilers **,1290297600,"11 21, 2010",2010,2151,"['Part', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'faithful', 'book', 'most', 'part', 'few', 'things', 'were', 'cut', 'out', 'such', 'evil', 'werewolf', 'Greyback', 'Snatchers', 'cutting', 'out', 'Harry/Lupin', 'fight', 'favor', 'cute', 'tent', 'dancing', 'scene', 'Hermione', 'overall', 'spirit', 'film', 'was', 'faithful', 'book.Director', 'David', 'feel', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'great', 'film', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'clearly', 'redeemed', 'eyes', 'film.The', 'film', 'felt', 'rushed', 'first', 'book', 'was', 'more', 'build-up', 'Uncle', 'Vernon', 'other', 'hand', 'Harry', 'contemplation', 'little', 'stairway', 'closet', 'used', 'live', 'can', 'almost', 'hear', 'say', 'Wow', ""'ve"", 'come', 'long', 'way', 'indeed', 'one', 'be', 'hurt', 'injured', 'would', 'rather', 'go', 'off', 'trek', 'own', 'Ron', 'Hermione', 'will', 'have', 'none', 'go', 'Disapparating', 'English', 'countryside', 'Death', 'Eaters', 'hot', 'tail.Several', 'scenes', 'got', 'right', 'Ron', 'anger', 'jealousy', 'Harry', 'Hermione', 'Patronus', 'doe', 'lake', 'where', 'sword', 'Gryffindor', 'laid', 'snake', 'attack', 'Bagshot', 'place.And', 'most', 'amazingly', 'great', 'animation', 'Three', 'Brothers', 'tale', 'told', 'Hermione', 'interrupted', 'Ron', 'couple', 'times', 'Nitpicking', 'Follows', 'Several', 'things', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'More', 'elf', 'Kreecher', 'explanation', 'Regulus', 'Black', 'switching', 'Horcrux', 'lake', 'introduced', 'previous', 'film', 'book', 'Harry', 'disguised', 'self', 'Ministry', 'Magic', 'enabled', 'free', 'many', 'people', 'dungeons', 'Ministry', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'here', 'more', 'radio', 'was', 'lot', 'more', 'going', 'radio', 'Potter', 'Watch', 'Radio', 'Free', 'Wizard', 'something', 'Final', 'Thoughts', 'can', 'see', 'person', 'not', 'having', 'read', 'book', 'might', 'have', 'trouble', 'parts', 'screenplay', 'Reading', 'book', 'clearly', 'filling', 'gaps', 'snappy', 'dialogue', 'deep', 'emotional', 'investment', 'audience', 'wrenching', 'occasional', 'humor', 'tent', 'scene', 'was', 'cute', 'soundtrack', 'London', 'Symphony', 'Orchestra', 'was', 'superb.It', 'going', 'be', 'long', 'wait', 'summer']",N/A

1240999,A73QPH7NGI0DJ,B001UV4XHY,Sean Curley,"[6, 8]","If any popcultural product could be said to have dominated the first decade of the 21st century, it was ""Harry Potter"".  Between 1997 and 2011, the only years that did not see either a new book or film released were 2006 and 2008, and two years (2003 and 2007) had both.  Now, the saga is drawing to a close, with the seventh and final book being split into two films, staggered between the winter of 2010 and the summer of 2011.  At the helm once again is David Yates, who, when all is said and done, will have directed fully half of the films in the series, making his by far the most distinctive directorial imprint (though his borrows quite a bit from Alfonso Cuaron's tenure).  The decision to split the story in two has inspired two different sets of opinion, with some saying it drags things out and other welcoming the extra time.  I fall into the the latter category; the expanded canvas, in my view, allows the story to really breathe in a way that even the best of the preceding films (""Prisoner of Azkaban"" and ""Order of the Phoenix"") did not.  Spoilers follow.The preceding film ended with the death of Albus Dumbledore (Sir Michael Gambon), the greatest light wizard in the world.  This is akin to America's nuclear arsenal vanishing midway through the Cold War; any sense of balance of power has vanished, and Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) is moving quickly to finish the overthrow of the Ministry of Magic and kill Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), the only potential threat to him.  Harry and his two closest friends, Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) have a quest of their own:  locate and destroy the four remaining Horcruxes of Lord Voldemort, which will render him mortal at last.  They have, unfortunately, very little sense of how to do this, and when Voldemort's forces come after them, they end up on the run, cut off from most of their allies.Indeed, isolation is the key theme of this first half of the story.  The previous films were set mainly around Hogwarts, which pointedly does not appear in this film at all.  Most of the supporting cast put in only brief, though usually memorable, appearances towards the start of the movie, and a few, such Professor McGonagall (Dame Maggie Smith) are absent entirely.  Yates and screenwriter Steven Kloves actually heighten the sense of isolation compared to the novel, where it was already pronounced - between leaving the Weasley residence and visiting Malfoy Manor, our heroes don't encounter a single friendly wizard, whereas in the book they met a few, and the wizard radio broadcasts have become merely a tally of missing or dead wizards.Thus the weight of the production descends almost entirely on Radcliffe, Watson, and Grint, the young actors we've been following for a decade.  By now, these roles fit them like gloves, and they all do the best work of their young careers here.  Watson, who was the highlight of the early films in particular, is amazingly expressive here.  Radcliffe has what is in some ways the blandest role, that of the hero, but he does an excellent job with it.  A frequent fan complaint about previous films was how Ron lost much of his more serious material in favour of comic relief - Rupert Grint finally gets some really meaty dramatic material here (as well as some of his usual good comedy), and shows real skill in his handling of it.  The supporting actors, ranging from other young actors like Evanna Lynch and Matthew Lewis to experienced pros like Helena Bonham Carter, Jason Isaacs, and David Thewlis, all do their usual capable work.  Some, in particular Lewis as Neville, will get their big moments in the second part of the story.  The technical aspects of the production are, as one would expect, flawless.Highly recommended.  Assuming Part 2 keeps this level of quality, and I see no reason to think it won't, this will go down as the series' strongest entry.",5,The end is nigh.,1299110400,"03 3, 2011",2011,3894,"['popcultural', 'product', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'have', 'dominated', 'first', 'decade', '21st', 'century', 'was', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Between', '1997', '2011', 'only', 'years', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'either', 'new', 'book', 'film', 'released', 'were', '2006', '2008', 'two', 'years', '2003', '2007', 'had', 'Now', 'saga', 'drawing', 'close', 'seventh', 'final', 'book', 'being', 'split', 'two', 'films', 'staggered', 'winter', '2010', 'summer', '2011', 'helm', 'once', 'again', 'David', 'Yates', 'who', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'will', 'have', 'directed', 'fully', 'half', 'films', 'series', 'making', 'far', 'most', 'distinctive', 'directorial', 'imprint', 'borrows', 'quite', 'bit', 'Alfonso', 'Cuaron', 'tenure', 'decision', 'split', 'story', 'two', 'inspired', 'two', 'different', 'sets', 'opinion', 'saying', 'drags', 'things', 'out', 'other', 'welcoming', 'extra', 'time', 'fall', 'latter', 'category', 'expanded', 'canvas', 'view', 'story', 'really', 'breathe', 'way', 'even', 'best', 'preceding', 'films', 'Prisoner', 'Azkaban', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'did', 'not', 'Spoilers', 'follow.The', 'preceding', 'film', 'ended', 'death', 'Albus', 'Dumbledore', 'Sir', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'greatest', 'light', 'wizard', 'world', 'akin', 'America', 'nuclear', 'arsenal', 'vanishing', 'midway', 'Cold', 'War', 'sense', 'balance', 'power', 'vanished', 'Lord', 'Voldemort', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'moving', 'quickly', 'finish', 'overthrow', 'Ministry', 'Magic', 'kill', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'only', 'potential', 'threat', 'Harry', 'two', 'closest', 'friends', 'Ron', 'Rupert', 'Grint', 'Hermione', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'have', 'quest', 'own', 'locate', 'destroy', 'four', 'remaining', 'Horcruxes', 'Lord', 'Voldemort', 'will', 'render', 'mortal', 'last', 'have', 'unfortunately', 'very', 'little', 'sense', 'how', 'do', 'when', 'Voldemort', 'forces', 'come', 'end', 'up', 'run', 'cut', 'off', 'most', 'allies.Indeed', 'isolation', 'key', 'theme', 'first', 'half', 'story', 'previous', 'films', 'were', 'set', 'mainly', 'Hogwarts', 'pointedly', 'not', 'appear', 'film', 'Most', 'supporting', 'cast', 'put', 'only', 'brief', 'usually', 'memorable', 'appearances', 'towards', 'start', 'movie', 'few', 'such', 'Professor', 'McGonagall', 'Dame', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'are', 'absent', 'entirely', 'Yates', 'screenwriter', 'Steven', 'Kloves', 'actually', 'sense', 'isolation', 'compared', 'novel', 'where', 'was', 'already', 'pronounced', 'leaving', 'Weasley', 'residence', 'visiting', 'Malfoy', 'Manor', 'heroes', 'do', ""n't"", 'encounter', 'single', 'friendly', 'wizard', 'whereas', 'book', 'met', 'few', 'wizard', 'radio', 'broadcasts', 'have', 'become', 'merely', 'tally', 'missing', 'dead', 'weight', 'production', 'almost', 'entirely', 'Radcliffe', 'Watson', 'Grint', 'young', 'actors', ""'ve"", 'been', 'following', 'decade', 'now', 'roles', 'fit', 'gloves', 'do', 'best', 'work', 'young', 'careers', 'here', 'Watson', 'who', 'was', 'highlight', 'early', 'films', 'particular', 'amazingly', 'expressive', 'here', 'Radcliffe', 'what', 'ways', 'blandest', 'role', 'hero', 'excellent', 'job', 'frequent', 'fan', 'complaint', 'previous', 'films', 'was', 'how', 'Ron', 'lost', 'much', 'more', 'serious', 'material', 'favour', 'comic', 'relief', 'Rupert', 'Grint', 'finally', 'really', 'meaty', 'dramatic', 'material', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'usual', 'good', 'comedy', 'real', 'skill', 'handling', 'supporting', 'actors', 'ranging', 'other', 'young', 'actors', 'Evanna', 'Lynch', 'Matthew', 'Lewis', 'experienced', 'pros', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'Jason', 'Isaacs', 'David', 'Thewlis', 'do', 'usual', 'capable', 'work', 'particular', 'Lewis', 'Neville', 'will', 'get', 'big', 'moments', 'second', 'part', 'story', 'technical', 'aspects', 'production', 'are', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'flawless.Highly', 'recommended', 'Assuming', 'Part', '2', 'level', 'quality', 'see', 'reason', 'think', 'wo', ""n't"", 'will', 'go', 'down', 'series', 'strongest', 'entry']",N/A

1241007,A1VABWDOUQLULZ,B001UV4XHY,S. K. Harrell,"[4, 6]","While I thought the production team did a great job with the film, I think it's a perfect example of ""if you haven't read the book, it won't make much sense.""  At this point, why would anyone see a Potter film without having read the books?  It boggles the mind.  That said, this review is written toward those who know the story, proper.The direction was good, as was most of the writing.  Rupurt Grint was ever on pointe as Ron, and Radcliffe has without question grown his skills as Boy Who.  Watson finally acted, and without total reliance on eyebrows!  She was actually impressive in this film.  Maybe she has an acting career ahead, yet. The adult cast stepped it up in this installment, as well.  Billowy-cloaked Snape is a thing to behold, as is a broken Lucius Malfoy.  I was happy to see Carter act as if she wanted to be there, which finally brought Bellatrix alive for me.  Newcomer Rhys Ifans was wonderful.  In short, every actor delivered a standout performance.  Very impressive, in that regard.  The creatively layered reunion of the entire cast was fantastic.  That excitement alone boosts anticipation of the next film.I appreciate that this film was split, in order to do the story justice, as well it should have been.  I can't help but think that all of the action and luster is in the second half, which leaves this lead-up a bit diminished.  In the story proper, this portion should be the emotional setup for what is to come, and in that regard I felt it lacked.  The darkness, thus direness, of the Wizarding world was made evident from the opening scene.  This is no children's film.  Know that the racy scenes and violence reveal this throughout.  Still, even with poignant smatterings of grief and terror, the emotional depth did not sustain.  I would have gladly sat through a four-hour film if longevity would have maintained the momentum better.SPOILERSI was a bit bereft of the treatment of Hedwig's demise.  As the film left it, her absence was the only real indicator that she was dead.  The lack of Harry's processing of that was equally unrealistic and unclear. More acknowledgement was given to the loss of Dobby, who had far less face time in the films than she did.  Though Hagrid was Harry's first real friend in the Wizarding world, Hedwig was his first real emotional connection in his life.  I didn't think it canon that this bond wouldn't have been more acknowledged at her death.Though the camping scenes didn't make for riveting action (the same can be said of the book), the character development during those weeks was long overdue.  We saw a darkness in Ron prior unrevealed, a depth to Hermione and Harry's relationship had only been hinted at prior, and a long-needed resourcefulness in Harry was finally tapped.  I agree with criticism that pace slowed tremendously during those scenes, but what we learned about the trio in that stillness was necessary.  In truth, it was better delivered in the film than in the book, albeit out of sequence in the film.Insight into what was happening at Hogwart's bore showing.  Early in the film, the impression is finally given that this is not just Harry's fight, but is that of the entire Wizarding world.  But by focusing primarily on the trio's lives and not how others contributed to the effort--and they were--much of that communal sense of obligation, thus sacrifice, is lost.Explanations of the Hallows was rushed at best.  If you didn't understand them or how they and their lineage relate to Harry's plight, I'm afraid rewinding won't be much help.  That said, if you know their far-reaching relevance from the book, the animated sequence telling their story was well-done, albeit quickly so.The cheesiest effect in the film was Ron's greatest fears come to life, seeing Harry and Hermione passionately locked together.  It looked like a 2D paste job against a rolling CGI effect.  I was so unamused by the effect that I didn't connect with what a riveting and psychological test it was for Ron.The best scene in the film was Harry silently summoning Hermione to dance.  Without being romantic or sentimental it was profound, showing how Harry has matured into awareness of and reaction to the emotional states of others.  This is the trait that sets Harry apart from Voldemort more than any other, and this scene subtly conveyed his finesse in interpersonal observation and reaction.Several vaguely explained plot items troubled me, most of which were also problematic in the previous films.  Dobby showing up with no explanation is a major oversight that did not need to be.  The Missing Mirror, which should have been introduced way back at The Order of the Phoenix and wasn't now shows up with no explanation at all.  This lack negates how instrumental it is in the escape from Malfoy Manner, and diminishes the grief that Harry still processes from Sirius', and most recently Dumbledore's death.  Along that line, the need for the horcruxes is revealed, though the significance of the items precious to each of the Houses at Hogwart's is not.  It will be interesting to see how they jam learning about them AND finding each of them into the remaining installment",4,Well done...,1292112000,"12 12, 2010",2010,5169,"['thought', 'production',

He understands that the war that Voldomort has waged isn't just about Harry. Yes, he is a huge factor; but not the whole reason. And this film really starts to show us just how big this ""war"" has become. Reaching so far as to take over the ""secure"" and ""powerful"" Ministry of Magic, and even taking over the sacred halls of Hogwarts itself.But, Harry is still a large part of the war. He is the figure that the good stand behind now that the thought to be immortal Dumbledore is no more.  And with that knowledge, so this film begins. Dumbledore is dead, and Harry is left clueless as to what he is to do with the fragments of knowledge that were left to him. He knows he must destroy the remaining Horocruxes; magical items housing split pieces of Voldomorts soul, keeping him immortal. But what are these items, how do you destroy them, and most importantly how do you find them. This is the main focus of Part 1. After realizing that he is not safe anywhere he goes, Harry with his trusted friends Ron and Hermione go on the run to find these remaining objects and learn how to destroy them.Deathly Hallows is one of the most well structured films of the series to date. Many things that the amazing J.K. Rowling wrote in the novel would have weighed the film version down and made it feel disjointed, but Steve Kloves has done a magical job at finding the root story, and side stories that are relevant to this. He has also given us one of the most emotional scripts, delivered with true and powerful performances by all; particularly by our core three. Daniel, Emma and Rupert have truly become amazing actors/actresses. So many scenes in this film are very depressing and filled with tension and all three deliver. Small additions also make the film all that much more amazing. The dance that Harry and Hermione share after Ron abandons the cause, is truly heart felt and sweet.But the action and set design are also astounding. The opening chase sequence with the multiple Harry's being chased by the death eaters through the skies and streets of London was amazing and intense. And the infiltration of the Ministry to steal one of the horocruxes is ingenious and while funny, very intense as well, and also gives us the chance to once again see the amazing Imelda Staunton as the ever nasty Dolores Umbridge. The chase between the snatchers and the trio near the end of the film is also very intense.Giving props to Daniel, Emma and Ron is commendable but the supporting cast is also amazing. Ray Fiennes as Voldomort is as always creepy and nasty as Voldomort. And Alan Rickman; although underused; steals every scene his character Severus Snape is in. But I must say that the stand out in this film to me was Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange who played the role with such cunning and murderous venom that she stole each and every scene she was in. Her torturing of Hermione was a terrifying scene to hear and behold.Death is also a major theme in this film, we loose several loved characters and many people are scene dead or worse in the film, so to all those thinking of taking their little kids, I'd say no. The film is very dark and morbid, and has a very forboding sense of dread hanging over it. This is not Chamber of Secrets or even Order of the Phoenix.I was immensely satisfied with this film, even if it was incomplete, but it is a step in the right direction. I have been, unlike some, very impressed with the last few films, enjoying the more mature and tense filled films.With Half Blood Prince being my favorite to date, even better in my opinion than this one.

What little dialog was present in the movie was very choppy and forced. The best actor in this installment was the CG Snake. The pace of the movie went from so boring that my eyes started to bleed, (how many times do we have to do the camping thing?), to disjointed and choppy warp speed. The majority of the scenes in this movie did not flow together well at all. They were more like someone unloading a delivery truck, first scene ""bang"" on the loading dock, second scene ""bang"", stacked on top, third scene ""bang"", you get my drift? Maybe a better term would be cookie cuttered?Now for the DVD itself, Far too much compression. There were times that I thought that Hermione was about 7 feet tall and 125 pounds. Several of the shots of Harry's face were very distorted. The DVD was also so dark most of the time that it was very difficult to watch. On the plus side this movie did not have the huge volume swings that many modern movies have. The sound level was consistently reasonable throughout the film.All & all, this movie is a must see only because you must see it before part 2. The worst of the movies in the series.

1241012,A30UWBHC4QL4JT,B001UV4XHY,S. Robison,"[1, 3]","I have always enjoyed the Harry Potter film adaptations. That being said, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part I, takes the cake in all respects as compared to previous Potter movies. As you may be aware, this is split after Malfoy Manor, therefore, you will not get a resolution with this film. However, the movie does end at a fitting point, setting a clear stage for the culmination in the next film, to be released in July 2011. What sets this film apart, however, is that it completes the transformation begun in the film adaptation of the Half-Blood Prince. This film is very DARK and emotional. This was the intention, as the Harry Potter sequel matured along with its originally intended audience. I would recommend this film for all ages, as there are no particularly troublesome scenes, yet, on the whole, this is an adult film, filled with angst, struggle, and believable character interaction. Acting has consistently improved over the course of the films: this is no exception. Definitely recommended, and you will not be able to refrain from watching this movie over and over if you are a Harry Potter fan. Also, this is consistent with the books: with minimal add-ons occurring only to improve the overall quality of the film.

1241013,AGS6L2HIGVZZJ,B001UV4XHY,S. Shanahan,"[2, 5]","I have previously been relatively unsatisfied with some of the movies due to a combination of poor script adaptation, suffering CG sequences or lack of acting prowess from a number of principal actors.  ""Deathly Hallows, Part 1"", however, is one of the only Harry Potter movies I walked away from without feeling it was incomplete in the way I felt about some of the other films. I was actually very satisfied with the end result, even with the changes it had, and felt strongly enough about it to see it again another 4 times.  There are obvious limitations when bringing a book to life on the big screen like budget problems and time constraints, actor availability, finding suitable and affordable filming locations and hiring a CGI company with the chops to get the job done.  I thought this movie addressed the shortcomings in prior films because most of what I saw I thought was done exceedingly well, both on the part of the crew and the actors.PROS:Nearly everything in this movie conveyed a sense of impending doom and haunting depression, even the rusted and dilapidated WB logo at the start of the film.  That sense of malcontent and sadness has been a big source of criticism from some, mostly those who have not read the book and don't understand that the feeling of hopelessness is canon in a majority of the plot.  That said, I found it to be appropriate, even if a little exhausting at some parts such as the times where we see Harry and Hermione slowly gathering their things, without speaking to each other, getting ready to change locations, just to set up again without speaking.  This movie is about a war and, although it's primarily viewed on the periphery, war is never happy.  Relationships are severely tested and splintered in this installment, but such is the life of someone who has been tasked with a near-impossible job, with limited knowledge of how to handle and complete the task, with the added burden of having few allies to turn to, no family and no contact with friends, all while being hunted by a racist, fascist government.  It's not exactly a walk in the park for Harry, so to those who are criticizing the gloominess of the movie, try to keep that perspective in mind.  The book conveys those feelings of overwhelming depression well and I think the movie does as well as it can, without the help of the creative exposition that is the luxury of the written word.I thought the crew did an excellent job setting the tone of scenes with lighting and camera angles and finding gorgeous filming locations that took my breath away.  They were far more beautiful, unique and - more poignantly - much lonelier than I pictured in my head when I read the book; that to me was one of the things that contributed heavily to the sadness the heroes felt.  This was also one of the few things that I thought the movie did better than book.  And I don't say that lightly or very often.The relationships between the characters are so very strained the whole novel; I felt this was handled well in the movie, though I confess it was something I was very worried about going in.  Prior to this movie, there haven't been many opportunities for our heroes to express and sustain emotions as powerful and deep as the emotions they experience in this novel, and I while I've enjoyed the previous movies, I've always felt the actor's abilities (especially those of our 3 heroes) left something to be desired and I wasn't sure they could hack the more intense emotional scenes.  I was relieved to find that they did very well in many of the major scenes, such as the big fight that sends Ron packing.  I was so happy with the way this scene went, nearly word for word faithful to the book and acted wonderfully by Grint and Radcliffe.  Another favorite was the scene when was Ron is Splinched coming out of the Ministry.  I about cried the first time simply because of Watson's feeling during that ordeal, it was very impressive.  Also, her performance in the scene at Malfoy Manor was incredibly unnerving.  That scene was difficult to watch and had a few people around me covering their eyes.Harry's birthday was cut out entirely, which I'm reasonably fine with; there was nothing hugely important in that chapter that couldn't have been put where it ended up and I felt that was an acceptable re-write.  In fact, I quite enjoyed seeing sneaky big brother George (complete with a toothbrush stuck tactlessly in his wound) coming in to embarrass Ginny And Harry.  I felt that scene was one of the most awkward of the film, mostly because I find the ""chemistry"" between Radcliffe and Wright to be pathetically strained, put-on and creepy to watch.  Oliver Phelps (George) saved that scene.I also appreciated that when everyone regroups at the Burrow after the ""Seven Harrys"" scene, they gave Mr. Weasley's lines in the book (or the equivalent of his lines) to Fred instead.  I felt that was a nice touch, and even as I was reading Deathly Hallows the first time through, the whole time I thought it would have been more touching and appropriate to give Fred more of an interaction with his twin than he had in the book.  It was so moving that even the audience seemed to breathe the same sigh of relief that Fred did.  That's tough to manage in a film so major kudos to the sorely underused and underappreciated Phelps brothers.  I had high standards for the portrayal of Fred and George from the beginning due to the fact that they easily number among my favorite characters of the whole series, and I'm very pleased that James and Oliver deliver so well every time we see them.CONS:The only scene that was cut that I truly actually missed, was the scene when Kreacher tells the trio the heartbreaking truth about Sirius's brother Regulus; a truth that not even Sirius or the rest of his family knew.  Although it probably would have taken up a full 5 minutes in the film - a hugely long time for a theatrical scene - in order to convey the message accurately and do the story justice, I still missed it since it was inspiring to learn about Regulus' bravery and sacrifice.  That scene also marked the beginning to Kreacher's newfound loyalty to Harry, which comes into play later on.  I hope we'll see at least some mention of in Part 2, even though the fact that the basis for it was cut from Part 1 may make the connection in Part 2 seem a little random so those who haven't read the books.Another thing I didn't like, but don't blame ""Part 1"" for, is the immense amount of damage control it had to do after the shoddy, rushed offering that was ""Half-Blood Prince"".  It seemed like all the loose ends that were introduced in HBP and were important to the overall story but we cut out of HBP were all stuffed into the ""Seven Harrys"" sequence.  It was like as each character comes into the room, they have to stop and explain themselves to Harry (or rather, the viewing audience) since Yates failed to include those many major points in HBP.  It's too bad the ""Deathly Hallows, Part 1"" has to take the heat for that shortcoming.My one major criticism would be the soundtrack.  With the exception of the song ""Obliviate"" at the beginning, I found the music to be unremarkable and that it added next to nothing to the movie.  As a former music student and performer for many years, I tend to listen very hard for a movie's soundtrack (harder than many of my friends and family members do) and look for a good connection between the movie and music, since music has the power to convey so much that actors or good lighting simply can't.  I just didn't find that in Part 1.  A good score can be easily used to express a message or feeling in a scene, but I can't remember a point in the movie when I felt moved by anything on the soundtrack.  I wish they'd stuck with John Williams or another proven veteran, rather than change things up, though I understand scheduling conflicts probably came into play.  The dreariest, saddest music can also easily be the most beautiful and stirring, but this soundtrack really disappointed me.  Had the movie not been so good as to prevent me from really caring about how bland the music was, I might have rated it lower.-----------As for the criticisms I've been seeing from others, one of the most common ones is that it's ""only half a movie"".  In order to preserve the integrity of the conclusion to the biggest selling book series of all time, it was split into two parts to allow for more time to address as much of the canon story as possible without rushing or cutting out too much detail that's so critical to the plot.  Some also complained it dragged.  This isn't a fair criticism for the movie since the camping scenes dominate the novel too, so to those who don't like it, take it up with Rowling, because the movie sticks to her book very well.  Actually, there's more camping in the book than there is in the movie, if I remember correctly.  Still, I didn't mind the camping scenes, since it illustrated the fact that Harry and Hermione (and Ron) really struggled with their goal while also having to be on the run for a majority of the story.Another popular critical judgment is the debated reason for the split in the first place.  Was Part 1 merely a ""lead-in"" to Part 2?  Just a ""filler"" or ""built-up tease"", as I've seen some critics and fans write?  To each his/her own, I suppose.  My opinion on it is no, it's not filler, and certainly not a way to squeeze more money out of the franchise, as a popular and shrewd argument that's been getting repeated quite a bit says.  However, if it were true, and money were the only driving force here - which I don't agree that it is - then please keep in mind that WB, whose purpose it is as a business is to bring in as much profit as possible, then really, what's the complaint here?  A corporation in a capitalistic society trying to cash in on something people like?  Perfectly understandable.But like I said above, I do not agree that the choice to split it was based on money-grubbing.  That decision was about maintaining the integrity of the story and I think a lot of people who've read the book can agree that this would have been a total let-down had the powers-that-be allowed all of Deathly Hallows to be stuffed into a single movie.  It's easy for those who are unfamiliar with the books to criticize that decision now simply because they don't know what's all to come from this point on, while the readers know that there's still A LOT of story in ""Deathly Hallows"" left to cover.  I'll be very interested to see if that attitude changes after Part 2 is released.  When they see just how much story is crammed into the final installment (certainly in the book and hopefully in the movie, assuming it does a good job of staying true), I think many of them will be forced to rethink that original opinion.  I think the 2-part split was for the best.Overall, I was impressed and very satisfied with how Part 1 was translated on-screen.  I, like many others, are stoked for Part 2 and can't wait to see how the movie brings to life the conclusion of the best-selling book series of all time.  I'm just annoyed there's an 8-month wait between Part 1 and 2.

1241014,AQJSMLYHE6GN4,B001UV4XHY,"StarReviewer ""SR""","[2, 3]","Fine, I confess; I didn't like the last Harry Potter book so much. It seemed very rushed, and the characters development just seemed to have stopping. For die-hard Potter fans, this movie DOES follow the book VERY well; but it also makes the characters more believable.For example, Ron is much more likeable in the movie. He's not perfect, but we can understand what Hermione sees in him. We get why he freaks out and why he's jealous of Harry. Hermione shines as a self-confidant, strong and smart gal more than ever. Harry is an understated character, but that works well. The casting is, as always, brilliant. Loved the casting especially of Bill and Mr. Lovegood.It's been a while since I read the book, but as far as I can tell, the movie left very little out, such as where Harry reads the encouraging graffiti at Godric's Hallow. Some scenes were added; Harry and Hermione's dance scene is great; I like how their relationship becomes closer, not quite romantic - we really feel how they're, for a time, the only person the other has. The Bill and Fleur wedding scene was altered; it's interrupted by a Death Eater Attack (which I found annoying). There was more action here than in the book; I don't remember the fight with Nagini the snake being so long; if you don't like snakes, don't watch that scene.Finally, another great thing about this movie is the landscape. I usually don't really notice the background in movies that much, but whoever was in charge of location was brilliant. Since the kids are apparating so often, they end up in completely different locations. From a snowy, sleepy town to the city to the beach, all the scenery is gorgeous.  I'll admit that, in the book, I felt lost without Hogwarts. This movie is VERY different from the others, but I actually liked it better for that. Because the characters and special effects were still brilliant, it just felt like going on a more grown-up, exciting adventure than before!Love the movie, can't wait for the next, and hope this review helps!PS I will totally buy the DVD, or at least rent it, so will try and give you an update on special features and so forth.",4,The Best Yet...,1290729600,"11 26, 2010",2010,2140,"['Fine', 'confess', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'book', 'so', 'much', 'seemed', 'very', 'rushed', 'characters', 'development', 'just', 'seemed', 'have', 'stopping', 'die-hard', 'Potter', 'fans', 'movie', 'DOES', 'follow', 'book', 'VERY', 'well', 'also', 'characters', 'more', 'believable.For', 'example', 'Ron', 'much', 'more', 'likeable', 'movie', 'not', 'perfect', 'can', 'understand', 'what', 'Hermione', 'get', 'why', 'out', 'why', 'jealous', 'Harry', 'Hermione', 'self-confidant', 'strong', 'smart', 'gal', 'more', 'ever', 'Harry', 'understated', 'character', 'well', 'casting', 'always', 'brilliant', 'Loved', 'casting', 'especially', 'Bill', 'Mr.', 'Lovegood.It', 'been', 'while', 'read', 'book', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'movie', 'left', 'very', 'little', 'out', 'such', 'where', 'Harry', 'encouraging', 'graffiti', 'Godric', 'Hallow', 'scenes', 'were', 'added', 'Harry', 'Hermione', 'dance', 'scene', 'great', 'like', 'how', 'relationship', 'closer', 'not', 'quite', 'romantic', 'really', 'feel', 'how', ""'re"", 'time', 'only', 'person', 'other', 'Bill', 'Fleur', 'wedding', 'scene', 'was', 'altered', 'interrupted', 'Death', 'Eater', 'Attack', 'found', 'annoying', 'was', 'more', 'action', 'here', 'book', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'fight', 'Nagini', 'snake', 'being', 'so', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'snakes', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'scene.Finally', 'great', 'thing', 'movie', 'landscape', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'notice', 'background', 'movies', 'much', 'whoever', 'was', 'charge', 'location', 'was', 'brilliant', 'kids', 'are', 'apparating', 'so', 'often', 'end', 'up', 'completely', 'different', 'locations', 'snowy', 'sleepy', 'town', 'city', 'beach', 'scenery', 'gorgeous', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'book', 'felt', 'lost', 'Hogwarts', 'movie', 'VERY', 'different', 'others', 'actually', 'liked', 'better', 'characters', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'still', 'brilliant', 'just', 'felt', 'going', 'more', 'grown-up', 'exciting', 'adventure', 'before', 'Love', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'next', 'hope', 'review', 'PS', 'will', 'totally', 'buy', 'DVD', 'least', 'rent', 'so', 'will', 'try', 'give', 'update', 'special', 'features', 'so', 'forth']",N/A
1241015,A2H3JURQZOHVMB,B001UV4XHY,"Stella Carrier ""joyfulwoman2078""","[1, 1]","While keeping the plot discreet, I must start off by saying that this one of the best installments of the series to have come out since the first movie. I have been fortunate in being able to see all the Harry Potter installments, including this one. However, I must say that from my perspective, that the movie is so intense, that anyone that is 12 or under may need a person to accompany them that is at least 18 or over. I say this only because I feel that this movie is terrific, but it is much more intense than the other installments. This movie finds Harry Potter and his friends coming to terms with learning who is truthfully on their side and the people that he knew that went to the dark side. There is strong romantic chemistry between both Hermoine and Harry and Hermoine and Ron that you end up wondering how the future between the three of them is going to unfold. From the beginning the movie carefully paints a picture that one cannot overcome the trials of life alone. Once again in this movie, the viewer gets to see many of the people that are going to be a part in helping Harry and his friends along their journey. This series has alot of good special effects and scenery that both adults and children are going to love. The plot, all the way up to the ending is very well developed that time really flies when you see the movie. Many of the events in the movie are very exciting and leave you in suspense. Last, but not least, I enjoyed the Harry Potter movie that was released last summer. However, I would have to say that this movie (the Deathly Hallows one) is definitely better than last years, and many like myself are going to feel that it is even better than the first (which is saying alot, because the first installment is a classic).",5,Harry Potter and the Dramatic Hallows,1290384000,"11 22, 2010",2010,1767,"['keeping', 'plot', 'discreet', 'must', 'start', 'off', 'saying', 'one', 'best', 'installments', 'series', 'have', 'come', 'out', 'first', 'movie', 'have', 'been', 'fortunate', 'being', 'able', 'see', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'installments', 'including', 'one', 'However', 'must', 'say', 'perspective', 'movie', 'so', 'intense', 'anyone', '12', 'may', 'need', 'person', 'accompany', 'least', '18', 'say', 'only', 'feel', 'movie', 'terrific', 'much', 'more', 'intense', 'other', 'installments', 'movie', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'friends', 'coming', 'terms', 'learning', 'who', 'truthfully', 'side', 'people', 'knew', 'went', 'dark', 'side', 'strong', 'romantic', 'chemistry', 'Hermoine', 'Harry', 'Hermoine', 'Ron', 'end', 'up', 'wondering', 'how', 'future', 'three', 'going', 'unfold', 'beginning', 'movie', 'carefully', 'picture', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'overcome', 'trials', 'life', 'alone', 'Once', 'again', 'movie', 'viewer', 'see', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'part', 'helping', 'Harry', 'friends', 'journey', 'series', 'alot', 'good', 'special', 'effects', 'scenery', 'adults', 'children', 'are', 'going', 'love', 'plot', 'way', 'ending', 'very', 'well', 'developed', 'time', 'really', 'when', 'see', 'movie', 'Many', 'events', 'movie', 'are', 'very', 'exciting', 'leave', 'suspense', 'Last', 'not', 'least', 'enjoyed', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'last', 'summer', 'However', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'movie', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'one', 'definitely', 'better', 'last', 'years', 'many', 'are', 'going', 'feel', 'even', 'better', 'first', 'saying', 'alot', 'first', 'installment', 'classic']",N/A

The CG effects in DH2 are way better than any of the other films. There is not ONE moment that doesn't have you on the edge of your seat/couch. The filming is dark when it needs to be, and bright when it should be. The characters are no longer young kids, they have arrived into adults, and play that role. The soundtrack...excellent. Subdued and used purely to accent the action. While the plot takes you to the inevitable end, you find yourself embracing it, and, even though it is the end of this fantastic series, accepting. You will bury your face in your hands at the sad parts (yes, I may have shed a few tears), but shout cheers at you tv for the victories. And after all, isn't that WHY we watch this series?

I have always found the movies good entertainment and good movies in which to have children watching. In fact I have always look at the Harry Potter movies as children's movies along the lines of the Wizard of Oz from my day. However this movie was a chore to watch. I keep looking at the time remaining to see when it would end. The acting was amateurish, the lighting terrible and a poor transition to DVD with too much pixilation and a story hard to follow. This movie was too dark, moody and I hate to say it, a little too violent. This is not a movie I would want my kid to watch. It was nowhere in keeping with the genre of the other Harry Potter movies. What a waste of money and time watching this painfully BAD movie. This just seem to be a way for the franchise to cash in on the popularity of the other movies and they could care less if the movie was any good. It is like they just wanted to get something out so they can get the money from the movie and the movie tie-in games. If you don't agree with this assessment fine as this is MY opinion about this movie, Not your opinion! Base on some comments I guess some people still do not GET I. I am making a opinion on the Movie NOT the book. Very few movies based on books are true to the book. Books take hours to read movies do not!

At times I am disappointed when some of the film adaptations delete sections, compress, or alter the books; although most are good movies in their own right.  Deathly Hallows part I does a good job translating the first 2/3 of the book and I would say the movie is about 75% accurate and captures the essence of the book.  There are parts that are very well brought to life, particularly the part where Harry sees the Patronus that leads him to the sword of Gryffindor, the return of Ron, and the destruction of the locket Horcrux.  Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rubert Grint, and Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy) have really grown into their roles - when I see them, I see their book counterparts.  The movies do tend to downplay Harry's temper and diminish his frequent use of the invisibility cloak in the books (one of the Deathly Hallows), but it has been fun watching the actors grow up and the filmmaking team as a whole has made a very deliberate effort to stay true to J.K. Rowling's vision.  Deathly Hallows part I has really nice cinematography and sets the stage well for the finale.

1241038,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B001UV4XHY,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[1, 1]","""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part I"" is being released on Blu-ray in plenty of time to capitalize on the final installment of the saga, due in theatres this July.  Warner Brothers decided to divide the last book of the series into two motion pictures to incorporate as much plot and as many characters from the novel as possible.Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is the primary obstacle to the total control by Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) of both the wizard and human worlds.  Voldemort has sent an army of Death Eaters to find the young wizard.  Accompanied by Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint), Harry embarks on a journey that finds him crossing paths with many of the characters he's previously encountered at Hogwarts.Director David Yates handles the action sequences effectively. The film starts with a terrific chase in which Alastor Moody (Brendan Gleeson) turns many of Harry's closest friends into Potter clones to confuse the Death Eaters.  Another standout sequence is Harry and friends' infiltration of the Ministry of Magic.  Unfortunately, the film's pacing is sluggish and bogs down the proceedings considerably.This installment is far different in tone from the first.  It is darker and downbeat, plodding and repetitious.  The special effects, as usual in a Potter film, are very good, but the magic isn't there.  Back are familiar characters Severus Snape (Alan Rickman), Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham Carter), Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton), and Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane).The three-disc Combo Pack edition contains Blu-ray, DVD, and Digital Copy versions of the movie.

1241041,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B001UV4XHY,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[2, 3]","Sad days lay ahead now that the ""Harry Potter"" saga is coming to an end.There isn't anything else like it now (""Twilight""? Please!) and it seems doubtful anything else will be able to match it for some time to come. Author JK Rowling created a series of highly imaginative books introducing us to a bevy of unusual, interesting characters we have lived with for a long time, so long they seem like friends/ When the enormous success of the first few books led to the inevitable films, many die-hard fans were worried. Thankfully, the first two films were adequate, if uninspired. Beginning with the third film, the series takes on a darker personality, to match the tone of the books, and allowed a handful of more creative directors to create a movie series worthy of the imagination the books helped us conjure.Warner Bros. made the right decision to tell the story of the ""Deathly Hallows"" in two films. This frees Steve Kloves, the screenwriter of the entire series, and David Yates, the director of the last four films in the series, to tell as much of the story as humanly possible. Given ""Part 1"" runs close to 3 hours, they are covering a lot of the book. This is a refreshing change of pace as each of the previous film adaptations pared down the material, sacrificing characters, subplots, relationships.And much like the book, ""Part 1"" basically sets up ""Part 2"". It is basically an introduction to the conclusion, the set-up for the big finale, the epic battle between Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort. Some may feel there is too much exposition. I don't. It works and the filmmaking is top notch creating a thrilling chapter in the series.Picking up at what would be the beginning of Potter's final year at Hogwarts, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint) wait anxiously for their friends in the Order of the Phoenix. Soon everyone assembles at Harry's Muggle home and an elaborate plan is put in place to move Harry to a secure location and keep him out of the hands of Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes). But Voldemort and his minions are hot on their path. Harry, Hermione and Ron quickly decide to flee to a secret place in the forest and hide out. They spend every moment trying to figure out how to find and destroy the remaining Horcruxes. Once these powerful mementos of Tom Riddle's life are gone, they believe He Who Must Not Be Named will be vulnerable and they stand a chance to defeat the enemy. But Voldemort is looking for some very different items, the Deathly Hallows, items he believes will help him defeat that pesky Potter.Yates and Kloves have done a remarkable job of building the story towards this inevitable dark climax. As the stakes rise, the danger increases matching the dark tone of the narrative. Given this series was originally written with pre-teens in mind, it is nice to see the filmmakers have not shied away from depicting these dark moments.Throughout the series, the three leads have grown both physically and as actors. Daniel Radcliffe creates a viable persona for Harry, giving him a human quality, real feelings, making us care and root for him. When his friends face danger on his behalf, we can see the pain on his face as he realizes the sacrifices others are making for him. Emma Watson continues to give Hermione a real depth. She has always been the smart one, the one who excels in her studies, and the one her friends turn to for a quick spell or an answer to a puzzle. But as she has grown into a young lady, threads of confusion have woven into her performance; she doesn't understand the power she holds over boys, but is only too willing to use this power when necessary. Rupert Grint has grown most of all. In the early days, his google eyes and incessant mugging made it almost impossible to watch him. Now, he is able to channel the real feelings and distractions any teenager might feel which make him seem more real and more interesting.The most disappointing thing about ""Part 1"" is something dictated by the book, so I am not sure the film should be faulted. The best thing about this series is the rich wealth of acting talent appearing in supporting roles as various wizards, witches and villains. Alan Rickman, the best throughout, plays the sly, sneaky and snarky Professor Severus Snape. It is great fun to watch him play the role, tailor-made for his talents, with such relish. Maggie Smith is very good as Professor McGonagall, the head of Harry's house and a defacto mother for the young wizard. Robbie Coltrane, Timothy Spall, Helena Bonham Carter, Emma Thompson, Jim Broadbent, Miranda Richardson, Brendan Gleeson, Richard Harris, Imelda Staunton, Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Gary Oldman, Julie Walters, Jason Isaacs, Fiona Shaw, Richard Griffiths and Michael Gambon, to name a very few, have all taken on roles and all have been memorable.Ralph Fiennes returns as Lord Voldemort, the ultimate bad guy. He Who Must Not Be Named is ready to battle the young wizard, his nemesis for all of these years. He is ready to take over the wizarding world, his power is growing, and he now has control of the Ministry of Magic and Hogwarts. Muggles should be very afraid.But in ""Part 1"", a significant portion of the film involves the three young friends hiding out in the forest, trying to figure things out. This involves a lot of talking and some arguing. Most of all, these moments keep us away from most of the British actors who lend their talents to and provide some of the most memorable moments in the series. While Radcliffe, Watson and Grint have all grown as actors, it is still far more interesting to watch them interact with a virtual who's-who of British cinema. Thankfully, many of these actors should play a more pivotal role in ""Part 2"".The ""Harry Potter"" franchise has been and will continue to be so lucrative for all involved it makes sense Warner Bros. has always been extremely careful with each film, creating one great film after another. ""Part 1"" is no exception and I think it may be one of the most beautiful in the series. From the moment we enter the wizarding world, everything looks real, beautiful and wonderful. The ability to make this world appear so real, as it basically sits on top of London, is no small feat. The film opens with an exciting chase, our attention focused on Harry as he rides in Hagrid's sidecar. The motorcycle roars through London traffic and at one point drives upside down in a tunnel. The motorcycle speeds through traffic and helps illustrate the danger our hero faces as he straddles these two worlds. The previously mentioned scenes of the trio in the forest and other natural locales are also beautiful, reflecting the harsh reality of a British winter. When the action moves to the Ministry of Magic, you feel as though your are entering the halls of a hallowed institution.I also enjoyed the Tale of the Deathly Hallows. Late in the film, Hermione finally has a moment to recount the story for Harry's benefit. As she narrates the fable, it is illustrated for us using a series of dark shadows, as though puppets are recreating the tale. This technique helps to give the story a children's book quality; the characters might be hand shadows or paper cutouts moving across a sepia background. It is a nice touch to further reinforce the fable nature of the story, a fable both Hermione and Ron heard as children. It almost feels as though we are watching the story unfold through Potter's eyes.The ""Harry Potter"" films are magical and as the series comes to a close, everyone has such high expectation for the last two films. If these expectations aren't met, they will feel disappointed. Originally, ""Part 1"" was going to be released in 3-D, which was exciting news; using this technique promised to bring the world in these films to life. But then Warner Bros. changed their plans and I learned these films weren't actually made in 3-D. They were going to retrofit the second to last film, the same technique used to help make ""Clash of the Titans"" the piece of crap it is. Thank goodness they changed their mind. ""Clash"" looks terrible, as though the film was made in the 50s using the original 3-D technology. The newest ""Chronicles of Narnia"" is also retrofitted and looks it. I have to wonder why they continue to do this and also why didn't they just make the film in 3-D to begin with? It boggles my mind to think they might have subjected ""Part 1"" to this process, creating a sub par entry in the series. As the second to last entry in the series, an awful experience would be a huge let down to the loyal fans and would leave a bad taste in their mouth.Hopefully, this common sense will prevail for ""Part 2"" as well.""Deathly Hallows Part 1"" is a necessary step to ""Part 2"". It isn't the most memorable entry in the series, but it is very good. And my expectations for ""Part 2"" are very high.",4,Sad Times Are Ahead...

1241049,A2YKADCJME4FSW,B001UV4XHY,Tom Birkenstock,"[2, 3]","As the aggregation of six films, the first part of the final Harry Potter film, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 (whew), carries with it weighty expectations.  With each installment the stakes have been raised to the point where the final film will have awfully high hurdles to clear.  Besides, after making one's way through what's likely around fifteen hours of film already, you're likely going to want a massive payoff.  In the case of HP 7.5, it may be too early to decide whether the concluding movie delivers on the ever growing anticipation for the final conflict between good and evil, but I can confidently state that the film ingeniously ups the ante not by making Potter and his gang face off against even more powerful magicians, but by making our heroes grapple with their own interior fears, jealousies and existential nightmares.Just as the final film in the series has been cleaved in two, we might look at HP 7.5 as a film divided.  The first half takes the form of an espionage thriller, pitting Voldermort against the Order of the Phoenix.  Realizing that Harry might be the only person capable of defeating Voldemort, the Order of the Phoenix creates several Harry decoys in hopes of redirecting any assassination attempts away from the real Harry.  Their ruse is almost immediately discovered when several Death Eaters intercept the faux-Harries (and the real one) in mid-air, leading to an impressive chase scene across the London skyline and English countryside.  This action sequence is perhaps only bested by Harry, Ron and Hermione's infiltration of the Ministry of Magic, which has been recently co-opted by the Death Eaters, to retrieve a magic locket.  These set pieces give the audience exactly what they want from their blockbusters: big adventure and even bigger special effects.  Unlike the average blockbuster, which usually globs a bunch of CGI on the screen like a two year old with finger paints, HP 7.5's action is carefully crafted mixture of excruciating suspense and daring deeds.About halfway through the film, however, HP 7.5 makes a strange turn into what seems like a different film.  After recovering the magic locket from the Ministry of Magic, Harry and company flee to the English countryside in order to decide how to dispose of this mystical object.  The locket, we learned from the last installment, is a horcrux, or an object that houses part of Voldemort's soul and grants him eternal life, until they're all destroyed, that is.  The horcrux locket shares many of the same qualities as the ring in Tolkein's Lord of the Rings saga.  It cannot be destroyed by except under special circumstances and brings out the worst in whoever happens to bear the locket at any given time.  Naturally, the three take turns with the evil artifact, but this precaution still does not prevent the inanimate agitator from wreaking havoc on their interpersonal relationships.  Ron is the first affected by the heavy burden of the locket, accusing Harry and Hermione of carrying on an illicit affair and eventually abandoning their expedition.Of course, Ron isn't entirely wrong in his accusations.  It is difficult not to notice a simmering mutual attraction between Harry and Hermione.  After Ron leaves, the two of them share a dance to a Nick Cave song (a lesser director would have brought in the overused ""Hallelujah,"" and still an even lesser director would have used the Rufus Wainright cover), a surprisingly tender moment that is at first difficult to read.  By establishing that Ron's insecurities are more than just paranoia, the film utilizes the locket's magic to uncover real depth to its characters.  The majority of the second half follows the characters as they attempt to discover how to destroy the horcrux, all the while moving from one gorgeous British landscape to the next.  This extended camping trip seems somewhat lugubrious compared to the tightly constructed first half, and, as they stumble from one clue to the next Harry and Hermione seem at a loss as to what direction to take and where to go.  This is their ""Jesus in the Wilderness"" moment where the characters begin to question the efficacy of what they are doing.  We might also situate this stretch of the film within the innocence to experience themes that Rowlings has been working with since the first book.If we view the Harry Potter saga as a story about a boy growing up and learning more about himself and the world as he progresses through an educational system, then, like anyone who has graduated from high school or college, we must contend with the question of what this individual will do once he is freed from the helpful constraints of schooling, where the next step forward is always placed right in front of you.  Every schoolchild dreams of the freedom of adulthood, but few actually know what to do with themselves immediately after escaping the bonds of education (tellingly, Hogwarts is absent this time around).  Everyone has his or her moment in the wilderness.  This reading of HP 7.5 is bolstered by the strange, esoteric logic of the quest.  The way that Harry and Hermione stumble from one clue to the next signifies the sometimes directionless nature of adulthood.What's particularly ingenious about HP 7.5 is that it overlays adult existentialist questions over what is ostensibly a ""children's film.""  It is not, however, the first kid's film of 2010 to do this.  Toy Story 3 similarly grappled with questions of life's purpose and death's eventuality.  What makes these films ""dark"" has nothing to do with violence or obscenities (although the trash dump in Toy Story 3 was rather frightening), but rather with their ability to imbue films made for a broad audience with themes that most of us would rather not think about on our day out with the relatives.  There are other family films that are more violent and contain more sexual innuendoes, but these elements just as often make the films more juvenile as they make them more adult (filmmakers and fanboys take note).  HP 7.5 and TS 3 show us that big movies are capable of tackling big questions.HP 7.5 strides into theaters with the confidence only millions of ready made fans can muster.  It decides, with great effect, to slow the plot down just when most films would be hustling to throw everything they have at the audience.  It also includes a gorgeous animated sequence that incorporates fairy tales into the repertoire of Rowling's collage of influences.  If there is one thing that holds the film back, it is its role as prelude to the big finale.  It is difficult for a film without an ending to fully satisfy, especially when we know that part two is just a few months away.  Of course, when the credits roll on the final Harry Potter film, I reserve the right to adjust my score accordingly.",4,Harry and friends face inner demons.,1294531200,"01 9,

Not everyone will see the beauty of this 7th Potter film but I think splitting the final film in two was a great decision, of course money-wise it was a very good idea for Warner Bros profitable to do so. It also allows viewers a more complete visual experience of the book. Contrary to what some may think I feel that splitting the final book into two movies was for the best because it gives more room for character emotion, ambiance and best of all, it doesn't rush things. I must say the action is a bit slower and Hogwarts is missed but Part 1 sets things up nicely for the conclusion of the Harry potter saga on movies. Everything that needed to be in this movie was and they didn't cut out much. As for the acting I don't think the actors have ever been better in a Harry Potter movie their performances here were nothing short of excellent and brilliant. I won't go through the storyline or the events of the movie, this should be clear by now and I don't think there is much more to say, basically Harry, Hermione and Ron search for the missing horcruxes. I don't want to spoil anything or reveal too much but I just want to say that one of my favorite parts was the animation showed for the story of the three brother in ""The Tales of Beetle the Bard"". It looked fantastic visually and even if brief is I feel, a highlight of Part 1.For the Blu-Ray: The special features are Blu-Ray exclusive, now I don't know why that is. Perhaps Warner thought that those buying the DVD version (which is a LOT) wouldn't like to have bonus features for some reason. The Blu-Ray has a disc devoted to special features only, the extras are a nice touch for fans and I did like them. For instance the 7 Harrys feature was pretty cool and I liked watching the deleted scenes but I probably won't watch the bonuses very often. The digital copy is not on a disc, it's an online download and from what other reviewers are saying it's not ideal because of software download, unwanted software and it isn't the ""safest"" download, let's put it at that. I would've rather had the digital copy on a disc like much of the other Blu releases but that's just a minor complaint.There are many complaints about the picture quality, especially for the DVD. I own the Blu-Ray/Digital Copy/DVD combo version of Deathly Hallows and I have to admit that these are definitely not the best Blu-Ray or DVD that I've seen. I watched both formats and I think the Blu-Ray looks better in comparison the very dark picture that you get with the DVD. I watched the movie in theaters when it was released and I don't remember it to be this dark. I don't know what it is but Warner Bros managed to screw up the picture quality for this movie, perhaps this will be corrected in the not too distant future with a boxed set of the 8 movies?I really enjoyed the first part of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows; it's a nice addition to the series and set the viewers for what should be a fantastic conclusion. It's hard to believe 2011 marks the 10 year anniversary of the first movie and the franchise! I can't wait to see Part 2 as I think Part 1 set us up so nicely for it! Now, as much as I love the movie I can't give this Blu-Ray/DVD release 5 star because of the picture transfer but those who are not too preoccupied by the darker picture quality should still go for it.4/5 stars, minus 1 star for the visuals.",4,The first part of the series' epic conclusion...,1303084800,"04 18, 2011",2011,3848,"['Technically', 'half', 'movie', 'really', 'feel', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'Part', '1', 'own', 'excellent', 'HP', 'film', 'really', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'consider', 'be', 'best', 'HP', 'movie', 'quite', 'enjoy', 'character', 'emotions', 'come', 'out', 'really', 'well', 'here', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'J.K.', 'Rowling', 'seventh', 'final', 'book', 'series', 'action', 'may', 'seem', 'slow', 'may', 'seem', 'bit', 'boring', 'Part', '1', 'was', 'necessary', 'Not', 'everyone', 'will', 'see', 'beauty', '7th', 'Potter', 'film', 'think', 'splitting', 'final', 'film', 'two', 'was', 'great', 'decision', 'course', 'money-wise', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'idea', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'profitable', 'do', 'so', 'also', 'viewers', 'more', 'complete', 'visual', 'experience', 'book', 'Contrary', 'what', 'may', 'think', 'feel', 'splitting', 'final', 'book', 'two', 'movies', 'was', 'best', 'more', 'room', 'character', 'emotion', 'ambiance', 'best', ""n't"", 'rush', 'things', 'must', 'say', 'action', 'bit', 'slower', 'Hogwarts', 'missed', 'Part', '1', 'sets', 'things', 'up', 'nicely', 'conclusion', 'Harry', 'potter', 'saga', 'movies', 'Everything', 'needed', 'be', 'movie', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'cut', 'out', 'much', 'acting', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'actors', 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'better', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movie', 'performances', 'here', 'were', 'nothing', 'short', 'excellent', 'brilliant', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'storyline', 'events', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'clear', 'now', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'much', 'more', 'say', 'basically', 'Harry', 'Hermione', 'Ron', 'search', 'missing', 'horcruxes', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'anything', 'reveal', 'too', 'much', 'just', 'want', 'say', 'one', 'favorite', 'parts', 'was', 'animation', 'showed', 'story', 'three', 'brother', 'Tales', 'Beetle', 'Bard', 'looked', 'fantastic', 'visually', 'even', 'brief', 'feel', 'highlight', 'Part', '1.For', 'Blu-Ray', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'Blu-Ray', 'exclusive', 'now', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'Perhaps', 'Warner', 'thought', 'buying', 'DVD', 'version', 'LOT', 'would', ""n't"", 'like', 'have', 'bonus', 'features', 'reason', 'Blu-Ray', 'disc', 'devoted', 'special', 'features', 'only', 'extras', 'are', 'nice', 'touch', 'fans', 'did', 'like', 'instance', '7', 'Harrys', 'feature', 'was', 'pretty', 'cool', 'liked', 'watching', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'watch', 'bonuses', 'very', 'often', 'digital', 'copy', 'not', 'disc', 'online', 'download', 'what', 'other', 'reviewers', 'are', 'saying', 'not', 'ideal', 'software', 'download', 'unwanted', 'software', ""n't"", 'safest', 'download', 'let', 'put', 'would', ""'ve"", 'rather', 'had', 'digital', 'copy', 'disc', 'much', 'other', 'Blu', 'releases', 'just', 'minor', 'complaint.There', 'are', 'many', 'complaints', 'picture', 'quality', 'especially', 'DVD', 'own', 'Blu-Ray/Digital', 'Copy/DVD', 'combo', 'version', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'have', 'admit', 'are', 'definitely', 'not', 'best', 'Blu-Ray', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'watched', 'formats', 'think', 'Blu-Ray', 'better', 'comparison', 'very', 'dark', 'picture', 'get', 'DVD', 'watched', 'movie', 'theaters', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'be', 'dark', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'managed', 'screw', 'up', 'picture', 'quality', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'will', 'be', 'corrected', 'not', 'too', 'distant', 'future', 'boxed', 'set', '8', 'movies', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'part', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'nice', 'addition', 'series', 'set', 'viewers', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'fantastic', 'conclusion', 'hard', 'believe', '2011', '10', 'year', 'anniversary', 'first', 'movie', 'franchise', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'Part', '2', 'think', 'Part', '1', 'set', 'up', 'so', 'nicely', 'Now', 'as', 'much', 'love', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'Blu-Ray/DVD', 'release', '5', 'star', 'picture', 'transfer', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'too', 'preoccupied', 'darker', 'picture', 'quality', 'should', 'still', 'go', 'it.4/5', 'stars', '1', 'star', 'visuals']",N/A

Harry Potter has been through quite a lot in his past 6 years at Hogwarts, but now it is time to make the full transition from child to adult.For the first time in film history a film based on a single piece of literature has been broken in two in order to bring the entire story safely to film. `Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1' shows us all the steps taken to the final showdown between Harry Potter & Lord Voldemort. With it comes many challenges and hurdles for Harry and his friends to overcome.  This film, while many call it a 3 hour filler is probably the most overlooked of all the films. This part of the story has some of the most incredible acting and character development seen in the past 6 films. With some amazing heartfelt moments that cause a rollercoaster of emotional states. I am quite surprised that this film gets so much flack. Now that I have seen Part 2 and I can firmly state that this section of the final chapter is in fact the better movie. I was more on edge watching this film than the second and maybe that is because I am one that really appreciates acting more than action. Not, that there wasn't good acting in the second part, but you will have to wait for my final Harry Potter film review when ` Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2' is officially released on DVD and Blu Ray.I also keep stating that I have a major beef with Blu Ray.

As much as I love the Harry Potter series, I was utterly dissapointed at the last two films. They strayed so far from the source material, I was quite honestly shocked and truly feared for the rest of he series. Well, I am pleased to say that Part 1 of Deathly Hallows is near perfection. High praise, yes, but I truly felt it did the book (at least the first part) justice. People have been complaining that not much happens and it is very slow-moving. Well, yes it is, but again, that is not so different from the book. The first part is a journey and sort of a teaser for the grand finale. Though not much action occurs, it is still quite interesting and truly suspensful. Especially if you've never read the books(which is just astonishing to me since they are a million times better than the movies).The characters are so grown up now and with that comes so much more emotion, and drama. The Half-Blood Prince contained too much humour, I thought. But Deathly Hallows Pt.1 contains just the right amount of everything. All the actors do an incredible job, even Dan Radcliffe, who I've always seen as the weakest link in the series. He's truly developed as an actor and did a wonderful job here. You can really feel the struggle these characters are going through on their journey.  It is just Harry, Ron and Hermione alone in the wilderness, trying to keep some sort of composure during their grim endevor. I do have to say one thing though: My favorite character in the series, Severus Snape, has literally one scene. I was extrememly dismayed but can only hope for more in the second part. Even with that one scene, he steals the show.The imagery is fantastic, the musical score is just right, the cinematography is first-rate.

There's also a featurette on the cast playing golf (!)which seemed kind of stretching. There's also a featurette on the recording of the soundtrack.There isn't a disc with a digital copy for those who use such things--you have to download the digital copy of the film. Demerits to Warner for advertising it on the package which implies that there is a digital copy disc inside which is a bit misleading. This isn't the first itme Warner has done this with the digital downloads--they did this also for a season of ""Supernatural"".The film certainly deserves five stars--it's a terrific, entertaining and thrilling ride. The transfer for the Blu-ray is stellar and the extras including the ""Maximum Movie Mode"" are good if not as exceptional as I'd liked (I'm assuming they're saving material for one of those ""Ultimate"" boxed sets).For those that are interested Best Buy has an exclusive Blu-ray disc that includes two featurettes that take you behind-the-scenes including the scene set in Picadilly and the location shooting of the film. Some of the interviews are recycled from other material on the set but there's also footage that isn't included in any of the other featurettes.Over all this is a good set with the film being exceptional.

Deathly Hallows Part 1 leads us into that final reckoning with Voldemort that we all know has been coming, and, as such, a much darker take on that inevitability.  All previous movies have really been about the training necessary to confront the boss; mere rehearsals for the final showdown.  With these final two installments we get to the real heart of the matter and it must be darker.  No, Hallows Part 1 (and for that matter Part 2 as well) are not as much fun as the previous movies.  This one's getting much more serious, as it should. These movies are so superbly crafted and executed that they are a testament to the near reverence held for the source material by Rowling.  The directors have done an amazing job bringing Rowling's books to life in a way that truly reflects their spirit.  Needless to say it's also a testament to the wondrous descriptive writings of Rowling which enabled this to happen in the first place.Also, as a movie, we watch as the character relationships between Ron and Hermione and Harry and Ginger come to fruition.  The acting by all concerned in these films has been a delight to watch.I have only one negative, and that has to do with the 3D version of the film:  it comes across as way too dark.  When I watch the 2D Blueray version, it looks great, but for some reason, 3D is not nearly as enjoyable because of that darkness.  I attempted to find some way to lighten it up, but couldn't figure it out.  My other 3D films, such as Avatar or Life of Pi, etc don't have this problem, so I am wondering if it was simply a case of this particular version of the Deathly Hallows that has this issue.  Part 2 has the same problem in 3D.  I will continue to investigate and see if there is any solution to this. BTW:  I have a 60&#34; LG &#34;smart&#34; 3D tv.  I have had no other issues at all with other 3D films with this set.If you are a fan of the whole Harry Potter experience, Deathly Hallows Part 1 is a must and is yet another very worthy work of art in that franchise.  Obviously, if you are not a fan, then there is probably little here that will compel you to seek it out.

1241070,A3MHGA6BJJ7P27,B001UV4XHY,"W. T. Hoffman ""artist and musician""","[2, 3]","I rented HARRY POTTER last night (Sunday, first weekend of availablity, so very heavy useage.) I watched the movie LATE, about 3am on the east coast, so I had none of the problems when overuse will lock up the signal. (I had the film streaming into my one year old laptop from a wifi hooked into a high speed phone line modem. From the laptop, I ran a hookup to a 32"" LCD TV.) People worried about lockup of the picture during high demand times,  might try to download the film instead of streaming it, at a time when you KNOW the peak use is down. AS FOR THE DARK SCREEN, i encountered that the first time I rented a video on demand. I had bought INCEPTION from AMAZON, and got a free rental of the film. COOL! SO, i started the film, and my screen was mostly just...DARK. I could hear the opening music, but nearly no picture. I tried to fix it on the LCD TV, but that didnt help. THE FIX FOR A DARK SCREEN. IF you look at the top of your laptop/computer (I'm running windows 7) you will notice TOOLS. Click on, and you will notice COMPATABILITY VIEW on the list of options.  CLICK ON COMPATIBILITY VIEW. This lightened up the picture, to normal viewing. NOW, as for pixelation. I believe that's an artifact of the limits of transmission. When you have a ""DARK"" movie, it can be annoying, tho I only ""noticed"" the problem at first. Your eyes or brain will adjust. I dont have the option to rent videos, because my small city has NO VIDEO STORES, except for grocery store video kiosks. Let's be realistic. If you want HI DEF/ blu-ray reception, you cant get that via Video on demand. I dont think the servers, or the modems, or even maybe the computer processors, have the power...YET. This is new technology for the most part. WE ALL NEED TO GET USED TO WATCHING FILMS LIKE THIS, cos it IS the future. Just be patient with yourself, and AMAZON, until we all figure out how to get things to work. If you get a black/dark screen, and the FIX VIA ""TOOLS"" at the top of the page, for COMPATABILITY VIEW doesnt work, try to pull your BRIGHTNESS CONTROLL all the way to LIGHT. I think this works via the computer, and the TV as well. I SUGGEST YOU WATCH THE COMING ATTRACTION for the POTTER film, and get this bug ironed out then, if you expect a problem. If the COMING ATTRACTION doesnt look correct, and you dont want to chance it, or your have an older system with a slow processor, simply dont rent the film over the internet.Now, as for the HARRY POTTER FILM ""DEATHLY HALLOWS PT 1."" I had no problem with the split. HEY, i lived thru LORD OF THE RINGS getting split in ways that drove me up a wall. BUT who is going to watch a 5 hour version of Deathly Hallows, and who wants to see the last book get over edited? The last book is too important. ALSO, ""Harry Potter"" isnt a kid anymore. The films have been dark, since the death at the tournement. I think that was the first REAL death. POTTER 7 has an ORWELL's 1984 vibe, with the way the ministry of Magic was taken over. That was forshadowed when Hogwarts was taken over. ALSO, the 10-12 year olds that liked the first movie/book, are older now. HARRY and company are literally warriors now. They can only expect a warrior's life. AND, we have seen this building for some time in the films. THIS IS A DARK FILM, and not just with the pallet of colors. Its about an orphan, its about evil taking over the world, its about oppression of Moggles (read: jews, blacks, the poor, etc). If your kid is 10 years old, NO WAY is this film for them. YOUNGER KIDS should be allowed to watch the first 3 films, UNTIL THEY GROW UP A BIT.  Unlike the LOTR, this is a very episodic series, that doesnt really depend on the previous book for the plot, UNTIL you reach films #3 or #4. IF this film were NOT dark, it would not have the depth of emotion. THIS IS HARRY POTTER AT WAR, troup movements, living in tents, visiting bombed out buildings and graves, its DARK STUFF for youngsters. HEY...rent MEGAMIND if you want ""LIGHT""entertainment.

1241074,AP3B615GM191G,B001UV4XHY,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 0]","After about ""Prisoner Of Azkaban"" (movie #3), I felt that the movies based on books 4-6 really just didn't do the novels their true justice (especially the ""Order of the Phoenix"" and ""Half-Blood Prince"" films).  By that point, the books were long past the simpler tales of ""Sorcerer's Stone"" and ""Chamber of Secrets"", and as a result they inevitably glossed over so many key parts of the series.  Fortunately, the movie producers realized that such an approach just would not work for the magnitude of the final Potter installment, and thus the project was split in half.  The best choice that could have possibly been made, IMHO.For a basic plot summary, ""Deathly Hallows 1"" sees Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermoine (Emma Watson) searching for Voldemort's (Ralph Fiennes) remaining Horcruxes.  While the Ministry of Magic and Hogwarts fall pretty much completely under Death Eater control, the trio learn about the Deathly Hallows and the endgame for Voldemort's master plan begins to take shape.There is no lag in this film whatsoever.  It starts off with a bang and never looks back (just like the book).  Yet, it is not just an ""action extravaganza"" like I perceived ""Order of the Phoenix"" to be.  It is also filled with nuanced character performances, humor, and a sense of gravitas (provided by director David Yates) that makes the whole experience very well-rounded.Until recently, I really wasn't a fan of the ""part one"", ""part two"" concept of filmmaking.  However, after seeing the success of this film (and the more recent ""Hobbit"" trilogy), I now am wondering if perhaps this is the way that books should be parlayed into movies all the time.  A film like this allows for many more of J.K. Rowling's little nuances to show up instead of things feeling rushed and glossing over a good many plot points.  Had, for example, ""Order of the Phoenix"" been done this way, I think I would have liked it a great deal more.",5,Maybe They Should Have Done All The Later Movies Like This,1376870400,"08 19, 2013",2013,1946,"['Prisoner', 'Azkaban', 'movie', '3', 'felt', 'movies', 'based', 'books', '4-6', 'really', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'novels', 'true', 'justice', 'especially', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'Half-Blood', 'Prince', 'films', 'point', 'books', 'were', 'long', 'simpler', 'tales', 'Sorcerer', 'Stone', 'Chamber', 'Secrets', 'result', 'inevitably', 'glossed', 'so', 'many', 'key', 'parts', 'series', 'Fortunately', 'movie', 'producers', 'realized', 'approach', 'just', 'would', 'not', 'work', 'magnitude', 'final', 'Potter', 'installment', 'thus', 'project', 'was', 'split', 'half', 'best', 'choice', 'could', 'have', 'possibly', 'been', 'made', 'IMHO.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Deathly', '1', 'sees', 'Harry', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'Ron', 'Rupert', 'Grint', 'Hermoine', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'searching', 'Voldemort', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'remaining', 'Horcruxes', 'Ministry', 'Magic', 'Hogwarts', 'fall', 'pretty', 'much', 'completely', 'Death', 'Eater', 'control', 'trio', 'learn', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'endgame', 'Voldemort', 'master', 'plan', 'take', 'lag', 'film', 'whatsoever', 'bang', 'never', 'back', 'just', 'book', 'not', 'just', 'action', 'extravaganza', 'perceived', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'be', 'also', 'filled', 'nuanced', 'character', 'performances', 'humor', 'sense', 'gravitas', 'provided', 'director', 'David', 'Yates', 'whole', 'experience', 'very', 'well-rounded.Until', 'recently', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'fan', 'part', 'one', 'part', 'two', 'concept', 'filmmaking', 'However', 'seeing', 'success', 'film', 'more', 'recent', 'Hobbit', 'trilogy', 'now', 'am', 'wondering', 'perhaps', 'way', 'books', 'should', 'be', 'parlayed', 'movies', 'time', 'film', 'many', 'more', 'J.K.', 'Rowling', 'little', 'nuances', 'show', 'up', 'instead', 'things', 'feeling', 'rushed', 'glossing', 'good', 'many', 'plot', 'points', 'Had', 'example', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'been', 'done', 'way', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'great', 'deal', 'more']",N/A
1241075,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B001UV4XHY,Z Hayes,"[4, 6]","Given that the concluding novel in the Harry Potter series covers so much in terms of plot and characterization, it is fitting that the movie was divided into two parts. I was quite wary about this latest installment in the HP franchise after some of the liberties taken with HP and the Half-Blood Prince (though I still loved it). I feel that HP and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 is one of the most (if not, the most) faithful adaptation of a HP novel to be brought to the silver screen. There is a perfect synergy of all the elements that made me fall in love with the story of HP as written in the books - great characterization made possible by credible and amazing acting; gorgeous cinematography; a score that perfectly captures the angst, tension, and drama of the unfolding story; and special effects that awe without overwhelming the audience or detract from the story.The only thing I'd like to mention and I feel is important is that this particular installment really does require prior knowledge of the Harry Potter novels. This movie takes it for granted that viewers will be able to fill in the blanks, like why does Hermione have to perform a spell on her parents which erases her existence from their memories? Throughout the movie, little snippets of Potter lore are sprinkled about which will delight any devoted fan but might confound and frustrate any newcomer to the series (which is why I would recommend starting from the first movie and working one's way through the series, in order). To really understand all that is going on, and the significance of certain things unfolding during the movie, I would recommend reading the book (to be able to see a particular scene and think, ""That's exactly how I imagined it would happen!"" or ""Ahh, so that's the significance of the ..."" was an enriching and immensely satisfying experience for me).I am not going to rehash the plot in detail - basically, this movie takes off some time after HP and the Half-Blood Prince ended. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) sends the Dursleys off to a safe spot as he prepares to go on his quest for the remaining Horcruxes which hold parts of Voldemort's soul. He is joined by best pals Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint). Part One of Deathly Hallows traces the trio's journey and sense of aimlessness (for they know not where the remaining horcruxes are); tension and strife between Ron and Harry; Hermione's sadnesss at losing Ron briefly; the constant pressure of being on the run; and perhaps most significantly, discovering that each of them truly have a purpose, that it is together and not individually that they are able to gain advantage over the Dark Lord. The actors who play the leads have truly come into their own and it is just amazing to see these young actors mature into and inhabit each of their roles with credibility and assurance, playing their characters with great depth. It is even more amazing given that they have been playing these roles for more than a decade, yet never do they show that they are tiring of their roles or just doing it for the money - there's real passion here.My only grouse is that Snape (Alan Rickman) does not get much screen time, but I'm sure that will be redressed in Part Two where he plays a more significant role. Helena Bonham-Carter was a hoot to watch as usual, playing the maniacal role of Bellatrix Lestrange with a fervor unmatched by any screen villainess in recent time (at least in my opinion). Ralph Fiennes portrays the Dark Lord with a credible sense of evil and malignancy, though his appearances in this installment are mainly via flashbacks and Harry's connection with the Dark Lord's thoughts.Three things that caught my interest (well, many things actually, but these three were unique): The dramatization of the tale of the three brothers, i.e. the Peverell brothers was done via animation, and it is gloriously done, with understatement yet is effective in conveying to the viewer the significance of this tale to Harry's quest. Another was the controversial scene between Harry and Hermione (spoiler ahead!) - Hermione and Harry are shown in an intimate embrace during a confrontation with the Dark Lord's soul and Ron who has been beseeched with doubts regarding their relationship flounders whilst the clock is ticking. This scene was tastefully done, and not explicit at all (except for kissing), so the PG-13 rating is safe! Finally, the scenes of persecution against the Mud-Bloods were so well-done and captured the hysteria that was so reminiscent of another time in the past, i.e. Nazi Germany during WW II.Overall, I feel this is a great set-up to the final installment in the HP series, and will especially please ardent fans of the novels. There is a perfect blend of drama, tension, bleakness, and even humor.
