There was no color film in 1914 but carefully colorized by computer the producers of this have taken the old black and white films of the war and made them into what they were, images of living breathing men caught in a terrible world. Yes some of the images are repeated, there was only so much combat footage of the war and some, like early tank maneuvers, are clearly training films but what is there is amazing.Organized in chapters following topics rather than just a front to back chronology of the war it is possible to watch the separate chapters over time. There is nothing new about the war here. It isn't even going into that much depth about the war. But for people who want to learn about the war it is a great start and for scholars who all ready know the war will love the imagery, bringing back to life and giving a realism to what had always been grey, black and white.",5,An Amazing Collection,1313452800,"08 16, 2011",2011,1319,"['final', 'survivors', 'First', 'World', 'War', 'pass', 'away', 'events', 'leave', 'living', 'memory', 'World', 'War', '1', 'Color', 'extraordinarily', 'good', 'documentary', 'keep', 'Great', 'War', 'becoming', 'stale', 'words', 'page.Ken', 'Branagh', 'even', 'narration', 'interspaced', 'recorded', 'interviews', 'handful', 'survivors', 'days', 'lays', 'out', 'wonderful', 'basic', 'history', 'war', 'great', 'charm', 'item', 'are', 'images', 'was', 'color', 'film', '1914', 'carefully', 'colorized', 'computer', 'producers', 'have', 'taken', 'old', 'black', 'white', 'films', 'war', 'made', 'what', 'were', 'images', 'living', 'breathing', 'men', 'caught', 'terrible', 'world', 'images', 'are', 'repeated', 'was', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'combat', 'footage', 'war', 'early', 'tank', 'maneuvers', 'are', 'clearly', 'training', 'films', 'what', 'amazing.Organized', 'chapters', 'following', 'topics', 'rather', 'just', 'front', 'back', 'chronology', 'war', 'possible', 'watch', 'separate', 'chapters', 'time', 'nothing', 'new', 'war', 'here', ""n't"", 'even', 'going', 'much', 'depth', 'war', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'learn', 'war', 'great', 'start', 'scholars', 'who', 'ready', 'know', 'war', 'will', 'love', 'imagery', 'bringing', 'back', 'life', 'giving', 'realism', 'what', 'had', 'always', 'been', 'grey', 'black', 'white']",World War 1 in Color
883693,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B0007N4AW4,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[54, 57]","Stunning! COLOR makes this footage more realistic than any other documentary of ""The War to End All Wars"". Today's technology makes a huge difference, but the narration (Kenneth Branagh) and personal accounts from men who were in the war make even more impact. This series is a great overview-not a complete history, but certainly covers the important segments. More than that, it offers the emotion, the feel of that war, the hardships. I personally learned a great deal about the war that my American grandfather lived through. Most who will watch this amazing footage will have never talked to a living soldier that survived, there are few left, and most of today's population is too young. This is an important piece of DVD saved history, necessary in every library and historical department of school.As important as the technologically added film color, is the educational focus on war machinery and weaponry that WWI inspired. I learned carriers, folding winged planes, tanks, flame throwers, and so much more was first used in WWI, not WWII. WWI was not all horse drawn equipment. The civilian footage (now in color) is dramatic as well. Literally seeing those early 20th century lifestyles & people on footage that is typically only found in still B/W photos is powerful.ALL 6 episodes as well as 2 excellent Bonus segments (one longer than an episode) provide SUBTITLES. The bonus material is as interesting and well done as the episodes. 20 bios, facts bonus, a time line, plus a booklet pack even more of the war into this set. Topics reachable in scene selections: classroom friendly.Episode details:1___""Catastrophe"" The cause: assassination in Sarajevo-1914, trenches, death, fighting, letters, wounded, survivors, diaries, air fighting, subs, steam and horse power--all there--now in color.2___""Slaughter in the Trenches"" 700+ miles of trench warfare proved a stalemate 1915-17, going 'over the top' meant almost certain death, new weaponry-more death.3___""Blood in the Air"" Dog fights, bi-planes lifting off a rigged battleship, ace hero's, bombing raids seen in color. Aerial reconnaissance, bi-planes with machine guns (fighters), Red Baron (in red), Flying circuses, sea planes, astonishing footage of air force action only 11 yrs after Kitty Hawk.4___""Killers of the Sea"" U-boats or submarines replaced battleship warfare, Lusitania-1915, Dardanelles, Jutland sea battle, ships going down, Hydrophone, depth charge, all covered with period film, now in color.5___""Mayhem on the Eastern Front"" German, Austrian & Russian western front trenches were horrific and as much a stalemate of the eastern trenches. The Russian Tzar falls leading to revolution and Lenin. Russian defeat adds to the eastern front difficulty.6___""Victory and Despair"" 1918 scenes of the bloody final year, victory, the cost, the aftermath, all of the pageantry and destruction colorized. A suspenseful final year for both sides. Then: 11th hour, 11th day, 11th month.A quality DVD documentation of WWI with more education narration than entertainment, astonishing old footage, personal interviews, realistic action scenes, and a must see for history and/or war interests.

I would instead like it known beforehand that I have read a lot on the subject, have watched a lot on the subject, and have delved into some of the more bizarre intrigues of warfare. My great-grandfather, a doughboy himself, sparked my interest when I was a child and, with that still impressing an ever-impressionable mind, I purchased this set to perhaps see a little more clearly into that mirror in time.While it isn't the image that makes the tale but the way it is actually told, there are a few images in the series that really did make an immediate impact. The first were the naval sinkings; when I watched those in black and white I had always seen the ship roll over and start to sink and had thought of how horrible that must be. When it went to color I didn't see it as a ship anymore, however, but more as a floating fortress with thousands of little people trying to dive into the water while hoping to escape. That really brought home how horrible this was, with the color etching little moments into a larger affair that really made an impact.And what an impact it made.Some of the other things that were brought out quite stunningly were the multi-cultural aspects of war, with the British colonies showcasing an astounding array of people I had never envisioned, and the sheer variation in uniforms that moved from nation to nation. As you watch the Germans march you could see how they stood apart from their Austro-Hungarian allies, for example, and when you stared down a line of trenches you saw some of the people that seemed to blend in with the surroundings. That meant exploring the mud and the foundation and seeing a little more of the condition, knowing all-the-while that those people ""going over the top"" were really more like myself than I had ever explored.That was really terrifying to think about, and especially so in some of the major conflicts where tens of thousands lost their lives in less than a day of fight.Then there were the machines of war, the tanks and the air battles especially, and how they looked. I never imaged the German aircraft being so colorful, truth be told, even though I had seen them in books and had seen recreations. It just didn't connect - but seeing it there made it seem all-the-more overwhelming.On the merits of that and that alone, I would say this is an excellent buy. If you go by price alone, World War 1 is actually the true forgotten war, with entire volumes on the conflict costing meager sums when compared to its more contemporary counterparts. It is short, true, and the longer sets do lay down a better foundation. Still, the set is quite amazing in scope and detail.",5,"The Impacting Color, Red",1184889600,"07 20, 2007",2007,2817,"[""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'write', 'scope', 'DVDs', 'military/historical', 'merit', ""'m"", 'not', 'historian', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'offend', 'sensibilities', 'who', 'are', 'would', 'instead', 'known', 'beforehand', 'have', 'read', 'lot', 'subject', 'have', 'watched', 'lot', 'subject', 'have', 'delved', 'more', 'bizarre', 'intrigues', 'warfare', 'great-grandfather', 'doughboy', 'sparked', 'interest', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'still', 'impressing', 'ever-impressionable', 'mind', 'purchased', 'set', 'perhaps', 'see', 'little', 'more', 'clearly', 'mirror', 'time.While', ""n't"", 'image', 'tale', 'way', 'actually', 'told', 'are', 'few', 'images', 'series', 'really', 'did', 'make', 'immediate', 'impact', 'first', 'were', 'naval', 'sinkings', 'when', 'watched', 'black', 'white', 'had', 'always', 'seen', 'ship', 'roll', 'start', 'sink', 'had', 'thought', 'how', 'horrible', 'must', 'be', 'When', 'went', 'color', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'ship', 'anymore', 'however', 'more', 'floating', 'fortress', 'thousands', 'little', 'people', 'trying', 'dive', 'water', 'hoping', 'escape', 'really', 'brought', 'home', 'how', 'horrible', 'was', 'color', 'etching', 'little', 'moments', 'larger', 'affair', 'really', 'made', 'impact.And', 'what', 'impact', 'other', 'things', 'were', 'brought', 'out', 'quite', 'stunningly', 'were', 'multi-cultural', 'aspects', 'war', 'British', 'colonies', 'showcasing', 'astounding', 'array', 'people', 'had', 'never', 'envisioned', 'sheer', 'variation', 'uniforms', 'moved', 'nation', 'nation', 'watch', 'Germans', 'march', 'could', 'see', 'how', 'stood', 'apart', 'Austro-Hungarian', 'allies', 'example', 'when', 'stared', 'down', 'line', 'trenches', 'saw', 'people', 'seemed', 'blend', 'surroundings', 'meant', 'exploring', 'mud', 'foundation', 'seeing', 'little', 'more', 'condition', 'knowing', 'all-the-while', 'people', 'going', 'top', 'were', 'really', 'more', 'had', 'ever', 'explored.That', 'was', 'really', 'terrifying', 'think', 'especially', 'so', 'major', 'conflicts', 'where', 'tens', 'thousands', 'lost', 'lives', 'less', 'day', 'fight.Then', 'were', 'machines', 'war', 'tanks', 'air', 'especially', 'how', 'looked', 'never', 'imaged', 'German', 'aircraft', 'being', 'so', 'colorful', 'truth', 'be', 'told', 'even', 'had', 'seen', 'books', 'had', 'seen', 'recreations', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'connect', 'seeing', 'there', 'made', 'seem', 'all-the-more', 'merits', 'alone', 'would', 'say', 'excellent', 'buy', 'go', 'price', 'alone', 'World', 'War', '1', 'actually', 'true', 'forgotten', 'war', 'entire', 'volumes', 'conflict', 'costing', 'meager', 'sums', 'when', 'compared', 'more', 'contemporary', 'counterparts', 'short', 'true', 'longer', 'sets', 'do', 'lay', 'down', 'better', 'foundation', 'Still', 'set', 'quite', 'amazing', 'scope', 'detail']",World War 1 in Color
