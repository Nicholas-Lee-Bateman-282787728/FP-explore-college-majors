His world is defined by visits from family members and an old girl friend, and by his meetings with a prison psychologist and the parole board. Each encounter is followed by dream sequences where he imagines an intimacy with them that is impossible across the physical and mental barriers defining their short time together. The story paints a larger picture of anger, love, and forgiveness that reaches beyond the unsentimental and unvarnished prison drama to a universal redemption unbound by prison walls.

His fight, however, is not with the prison authorities, but with himself. From behind the jail cell bars Alex looks on at the middle class life he left behind and his brother Tony (OBBA BABATUNDE, Life) who now has everything Alex does not. Visits from his parents (BILLY DEE WILLIAMS, MARLA GIBBS), his childhood sweetheart (RAE DAWN CHONG) and the prison psychiatrist (PHYLICIA RASHAD) start to rebuild Alex. Each visit teaches him to love not just the world, but himself. As this spiritual adventure of the heart reaches its unexpected climax, Alex shows us how we can all become better people when we face the demons inside us.",5,Will Change the Way You Think: That's Powerful,1097971200,"10 17, 2004",2004,740,"['Sent', 'jail', 'crime', 'did', ""n't"", 'commit', 'Alex', 'HILL', 'HARPER', 'Got', 'Game', 'must', 'now', 'fight', 'win', 'parole', 'fight', 'however', 'not', 'prison', 'authorities', 'jail', 'cell', 'bars', 'Alex', 'middle', 'class', 'life', 'left', 'behind', 'brother', 'Tony', 'OBBA', 'BABATUNDE', 'Life', 'who', 'now', 'everything', 'Alex', 'not', 'Visits', 'parents', 'BILLY', 'DEE', 'WILLIAMS', 'MARLA', 'GIBBS', 'childhood', 'sweetheart', 'RAE', 'DAWN', 'CHONG', 'prison', 'psychiatrist', 'PHYLICIA', 'RASHAD', 'start', 'rebuild', 'Alex', 'visit', 'love', 'not', 'just', 'world', 'spiritual', 'adventure', 'heart', 'unexpected', 'climax', 'Alex', 'how', 'can', 'become', 'better', 'people', 'when', 'face', 'demons']",The Visit
669856,A39XUWX0I4WH33,B00005NRNH,Jim K.,"[2, 5]","My reviews and ratings are based on DVD quality, not dramatic content or performance.The DVD is terrible and claims to be 16:9 -- it's not that.  I don't know what the aspect ratio really is.  I'd also like to know where the Dolby &quot;surround&quot; sound is because I didn't hear it.  It is in a limited stereo, however -- that's for sure, because a few times the character's voices were coming from the wrong side of the screen!  Pleasant!The picture is blurry at all times; the DVD must have been made from a mini-tape transfer.  In several instances characters are talking but there is background music instead.  Also, during scenes and conversations the picture will fade out completely and back in again.  Is that supposed to enhance the film?  I found it very annoying.  Perhaps the actors did not memorize their lines sufficiently to continue.  Did they have to change the tape or something?&quot;The Visit&quot; was based on a play, so that explains why there are few sets.As mentioned in my title, I would buy a VHS of this movie if you really want it.  You'll really be settling for poor quality if you purchase the DVD.  It's a shame, too, because I really enjoyed the characters and the actors portraying them.  I was looking forward to something of quality.  Then again, you could just look at the very nice, glossy snap-case while you listen to the film.

I also thought Rae Dawn Chong was the best I've ever seen her.  It is a terrible shame this film was deemed fit only to been seen in theatres on the West and East coasts.  I would definitely have paid good money to see this film to give it the proper support it so richly deserved.  I found myself connecting with these characters completely and regretted seeing them leave after a truly magnificent stay in my home for an hour and forty five minutes.  Please rent this film.  There may be little we can do about supporting it at a theatre near our respective homes, however we can do what is necessary to make sure it flies off video shelves.While it is not my intention to insult films like &quot;The Brothers&quot; and &quot;Two Can Play That Game,&quot; I do feel it is worth noting that films like &quot;The Visit&quot; (&quot;Eve's Bayou&quot; comes to mind as well as the television series adaptation of the film &quot;Soul Food&quot;) represent the talent Black actors and filmmakers are capable of if only given the chance to be seen and heard.
