777874,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B0000DBJDN,Brian E. Erland,"[86, 88]","'Cowboys and Angels' is a sweet, tender love story about one man's search for the girl of his dreams. Danny (Adam Trese) has been left standing at the altar and begins to doubt if true love really exists. Unexpectedly two attractive women soon come into his life (Mia Kirshner and Radha Mitchell) and before long he must decide which woman is the one fated to become his wife. What he doesn't realize is that angelic forces are present and subtlely guiding him to make the right decision.I love this movie! Mia Kirshner is absolutely gorgeous as Candice, she is fast becoming one of my favorite actresses. This is a film that can be enjoyed by everyone, old and young, so watch it with your entire family.Warning to Cowboy Movie Fans: If you're thinking of renting or buying this movie based solely on the presence of the word ""cowboy"" in the title, don't. It really has nothing whatsoever to do with being a cowboy. One of Danny's love interests happens to live and work on a ranch and you see a couple people ocassionally wearing cowboy hats, but that is the extent of it.",5,"""Who Do You Love?""  ~  ""Watching A Wedding Is Like Watching A Sunrise, It's A New Beginning""",1136332800,"01 4, 2006",2006,1074,"[""'Cowboys"", 'Angels', 'sweet', 'tender', 'love', 'story', 'one', 'man', 'search', 'girl', 'dreams', 'Danny', 'Adam', 'Trese', 'been', 'left', 'standing', 'altar', 'doubt', 'true', 'love', 'really', 'Unexpectedly', 'two', 'attractive', 'women', 'soon', 'come', 'life', 'Mia', 'Kirshner', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'long', 'must', 'decide', 'woman', 'one', 'fated', 'become', 'wife', 'What', ""n't"", 'realize', 'angelic', 'forces', 'are', 'present', 'subtlely', 'guiding', 'make', 'right', 'decision.I', 'love', 'movie', 'Mia', 'Kirshner', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'Candice', 'fast', 'becoming', 'one', 'favorite', 'actresses', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'everyone', 'old', 'young', 'so', 'watch', 'entire', 'family.Warning', 'Cowboy', 'Movie', 'Fans', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'renting', 'buying', 'movie', 'based', 'solely', 'presence', 'word', 'cowboy', 'title', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'nothing', 'whatsoever', 'do', 'being', 'cowboy', 'One', 'Danny', 'love', 'interests', 'live', 'work', 'ranch', 'see', 'couple', 'people', 'ocassionally', 'wearing', 'cowboy', 'hats', 'extent']",Cowboys and Angels

777879,A38L1FZNX9MU0X,B0000DBJDN,Harold A. Fretheim,"[5, 5]","This is a wonderful film, but can be confusing (Starting with the title- the sole thing wrong with this movie is the idiotic title). I have watched it many times and and find more all of the time.  In some ways, this is like a Scandinavian movie: The plot is in fact very dense and close nit- absolutely every part ties together- BUT it is not spelled out for you like some sort of formulaic romantic comedy. Instead, much is suggested and you have to use your imagination to fill in the additional details.  If the details had been spoon fed to you then the movie would have had to be four hours long: This is only acceptable if you are watching War and Peace.So, I will give you a hint or two: At the beginning of the film Danny is the best man at his sister's wedding. He is heartbroken as he was himself just left at the altar by a woman he was deeply in love with. Danny has high ideals, is in fact a very good man and truly believes in true love, but the result has been hurt and despair.To God, this situation is NOT a disaster- It is an opportunity. Time to send in an angel or two.......  Oh, and no this is NOt about how things are somehow specially arranged so as to keep Danny from becoming jaded. In fact he is in for some additional pain (literally) and heartache. One of the things Danny gets to learn is that he is NOT the center of the universe. But it turns out that this will also be okay.This film goes far deeper into exploring the ideas and nature of love than 99 percent of the love stories out there.  And the three main actors [Radha Mitchell [who is fast becoming one of my favorites], Adam Trese and Mia Kirschner) were all absolutely perfect in their roles.I do not want to spoil your enjoyment or appreciation for this little gem.  Rather, I want to suggest that you allow your imagination to work and help you enjoy the full story.  If you do not participate in the story with your imagination then you will simply end up bewildered (as a least one of the reviewers on this site did- what a pity).",5,A love story that is really about love,1209686400,"05 2, 2008",2008,2027,"['wonderful', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'confusing', 'Starting', 'title-', 'sole', 'thing', 'wrong', 'movie', 'idiotic', 'title', 'have', 'watched', 'many', 'times', 'find', 'more', 'time', 'ways', 'Scandinavian', 'movie', 'plot', 'fact', 'very', 'dense', 'close', 'nit-', 'absolutely', 'part', 'together-', 'BUT', 'not', 'spelled', 'out', 'like', 'sort', 'formulaic', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Instead', 'much', 'suggested', 'have', 'use', 'imagination', 'fill', 'additional', 'details', 'details', 'had', 'been', 'spoon', 'fed', 'then', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'be', 'four', 'hours', 'long', 'only', 'acceptable', 'are', 'watching', 'War', 'Peace.So', 'will', 'give', 'hint', 'two', 'beginning', 'film', 'Danny', 'best', 'man', 'sister', 'wedding', 'heartbroken', 'was', 'just', 'left', 'altar', 'woman', 'was', 'deeply', 'love', 'Danny', 'high', 'ideals', 'fact', 'very', 'good', 'man', 'truly', 'true', 'love', 'result', 'been', 'hurt', 'despair.To', 'God', 'situation', 'NOT', 'disaster-', 'opportunity', 'Time', 'send', 'angel', 'two', 'Oh', 'NOt', 'how', 'things', 'are', 'somehow', 'specially', 'arranged', 'so', 'keep', 'Danny', 'becoming', 'jaded', 'fact', 'additional', 'pain', 'literally', 'heartache', 'One', 'things', 'Danny', 'learn', 'NOT', 'center', 'universe', 'out', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'okay.This', 'film', 'far', 'deeper', 'exploring', 'ideas', 'nature', 'love', '99', 'percent', 'love', 'out', 'there', 'three', 'main', 'actors', '[', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', '[', 'who', 'fast', 'becoming', 'one', 'favorites', ']', 'Adam', 'Trese', 'Mia', 'Kirschner', 'were', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'roles.I', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'spoil', 'enjoyment', 'appreciation', 'little', 'gem', 'Rather', 'want', 'suggest', 'allow', 'imagination', 'work', 'help', 'enjoy', 'full', 'story', 'do', 'not', 'participate', 'story', 'imagination', 'then', 'will', 'simply', 'end', 'up', 'bewildered', 'least', 'one', 'reviewers', 'site', 'did-', 'what', 'pity']",Cowboys and Angels
