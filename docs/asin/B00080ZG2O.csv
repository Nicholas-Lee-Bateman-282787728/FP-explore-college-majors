John Shea is a delectably evil Lex Luthor, and remoulding Perry White into an Elvis freak is a stroke of genius. The Daily Planet sets cleverly reflect the influence of a 1930's comic and romantic sensibility that permeates the show. Dean Cain can't act (to put it mildly), although he certainly looks the part. It doesn't detract from the series too much because everyone else is so good, and the scripts are generally witty. Even so, Christopher Reeve's Superman (although not the film) seems more and more definitive.",4,Superman recast as Hawksian comedy.,1143849600,"04 1, 2006",2006,614,"['Teri', 'Hatcher', ""n't"", 'too', 'far', 'Jean', 'Arthur', 'Rosalind', 'Russell', 'beautiful', 'funny', 'John', 'Shea', 'delectably', 'evil', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'remoulding', 'Perry', 'White', 'Elvis', 'freak', 'stroke', 'genius', 'Daily', 'Planet', 'sets', 'cleverly', 'reflect', 'influence', '1930', 'comic', 'romantic', 'sensibility', 'show', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'put', 'mildly', 'certainly', 'part', ""n't"", 'detract', 'series', 'too', 'much', 'everyone', 'else', 'so', 'good', 'scripts', 'are', 'generally', 'witty', 'Even', 'so', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'Superman', 'not', 'film', 'more', 'more', 'definitive']",Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman: Season 1

L&C; just a breezy, fun show and I can't imagine anyone not liking it just a bit.Dean Cain fits this role like a glove, portraying a kindhearted yuppie who isn't hokey. -- probably the hardest part of playing Superman. Teri Hatcher as Lois is pigheaded and brave in her own inimitable way, like Lucy from Peanuts all grown up. Lane Smith is the best Perry White of all time, period. Micheal Landis is a success as Jimmy Olsen; His nasally Bronx accent is, oddly enough, perfect for the role. A big blow to the series was executive meddling which replaced Landis with Justin Whalen, thus ruining the rapport with Perry. Smith and Whalen are Laurel & Hardy, whereas he and Landis have a genuine bond.L&C; also puts a neat spin on Clark's parents, particularly Eddie Jones as an unconventional Pa Kent. The deep-throated voice and rotund appearance sets Jones apart from what is traditionally a good ol' boy depiction. Lastly, John Shea provides Lex Luthor with a tone similar to Telly Savalas. Unfortunately, the writers couldn't always think of things for him to do, so Shea pops up in various episodes for no reason. There are whole scenes of Luthor pontificating to himself, to his butler, to his dog, to his reflection, none of which adds to the plot (though his speechifying is fairly amusing). Similarly, Tracy Scoggins' Cat Grant is an utterly useless character.

897846,A2AVV9LV9UXT6F,B00080ZG2O,Amazon Customer,"[1, 1]","It's hard for me to admit that I actually prefer this adaptation to the first two Christopher Reeve movies, since I think those two are still among the best superhero movies ever to hit the screen.  But the truth is, on the balance, I do like this series just a little bit better, despite the silliness and the camp that it often displayed.  It was an interesting new take on the Superman story.  It's very different in focus from the movies.  In them, Superman was the main character.  The first movie shows his arrival on earth, and some of his upbringing with Jonathan and Martha Kent, and it's made abundantly clear, from the beginning, that he has a great destiny ahead of him.  His early life is just shown as preparing him for it.  Then, in his late teens, he finds a green crystal which leads him to someplace in the arctic, where he raises the Fortress of Solitude, and finds recorded images of his father, prepared for this day, and he spends years ""training up"" to fulfill his destiny.  He even reappears dramatically, in costume as Superman for the first time to make this clear.  He's not really Clark anymore; he's Superman.  Clark is now just a disguise he wears to fit into human society, and allow him not to lose touch with his humanity.  Superman is the real person, and Clark is the disguise (which is why he doesn't mind frequently looking like a fool in his guise as Clark).  The upside of this is that it does make it at least SLIGHTLY more plausible that a pair of glasses would be enough of a disguise, given that A) most people probably don't think Superman even has an alter ego, and B) that he acts so differently, slouches, and alters his voice as well.  Superman and Clark act like two completely different characters.  The downside of this is that it means Lois is never going to go for a dweeb like Clark.  Her eye will remain fixed firmly on Superman.Lois & Clark had a different take on things.  Superman is not the main identity, Clark is.  There is no Fortress of Solitude where he goes to be educated in his destiny by Jor-El's avatar.  He simply goes to college and studies to become a journalist.  Superman is not some role he was destined for; it's just a way he came up with on his own to try and use his great powers to help people, while still remaining able to lead a ""normal"" life and have normal relationships with his friends, family, coworkers, and the woman with whom he falls in love.  The downside of this is, that since he doesn't act all that differently as Clark and Superman, it is rather incredible that nobody ever sees through his disguise -- a fact at which they frequently poke fun in the series, with tongue firmly in cheek.  But the upside of this approach is that it does allow for Clark, as well as Superman, to be someone with whom Lois can believably fall in love.And this is where the series excels.  The Lois & Clark relationship has never been written better.  It starts out with Lois being grudgingly saddled with a new partner whom she snidely dismisses as ""a hack from Nowheresville,"" even as she is totally swept off her feet (literally in the final scene of the pilot) by the Man of Steel.  She soon comes to value Clark as a friend and partner, however.  She's actually attracted to him early on, but being a basically asocial, career-oriented, type A personality, with a history of bad relationships with both her family and her past boyfriends, this is something she would sooner die than admit.  But then, gradually, she comes to face her true feelings for Clark, and even, in the end, realizes that she loves him more than Superman.  This is something they handled really superbly on this show.  It bears comparison with ""Smallville.""  On that show, Clark and Lana are romantically attracted to each other, but in order to maintain romantic tension over several seasons, the writers were obliged to keep them from really getting together permanently.  Unfortunately, this is hard to do believably over such a long time if the characters are supposed to be in love with each other, and they resorted to a bevy of plot devices that had the unfortunate side effect of taking a character who started out as a beautiful, sweet-natured, good-hearted, girl-next-door, whom it was easy to see why Clark fell in love with, and transforming her into a rather unsympathic character, who is by turns, whiny, unreasonable, passive-aggressive, manipulative, hypocritical, and other equally unattractive things, and it got to the point that you had to ask what Clark saw in her.  The writers of Lois & Clark never did this to Lois, and yet still managed to stretch the pursuit and courtship out over three years.  If anything, Lois got more likable and sympathetic over time, and it was easy to see why Clark was head over heels for her.  Of course, it helped tremendously that Teri Hatcher was the actress playing Lois.  She remains far and away the best actress in the role yet, and her Lois was gorgeous, sexy, vivacious, aggressive, feisty, and just plain adorable, especially when she's displaying the temper that caused Clark to refer to her (after they got engaged) as ""my little tornado.""Dean Cain is good in the dual role of Clark and Superman.  He's not nearly the actor Christopher Reeve was, and his Superman is not remotely as good, but his onscreen chemistry with Teri Hatcher was perfect, and he's great as Clark.  Also superb was the entire supporting cast.  Lane Smith was absolutely brilliant as Perry White.  Michael Landes is also the best Jimmy Olsen ever, in my opinion, and the makers of this show made a huge mistake in replacing him (supposedly, they thought he looked too much like Dean Cain), though Justin Whalin did very well in the role from season two onward.  Tracy Scoggins was good, and it's a shame she didn't return.  And finally, Eddie Jones and K. Callan were perfect as Clark's parents.  I also like it that in Lois & Clark, Jonathan and Martha don't just raise Superman, only to die and clear the way for him to fulfill his destiny.  They remain an important part of his life, not only as the parents who gave him his values, but to whom he turns again and again whenever he faces difficult situations and difficult decisions.  And moreover, I like it that they remain simple, unassuming, ordinary folks.  It always kind of bothered me in ""Smallville"" how first Jonathan and then Martha got elected to the Kansas state senate, with Martha eventually becoming a U.S. senator and moving to Washington; it's always been a feature of the Superman story that his parents were just good, ordinary, salt-of-the-earth common folks (though perhaps ones with uncommon integrity and moral fiber), not influential politicians and power brokers, or great movers and shakers of society.Some are inclined to dismiss this series because it's a Superman series rather light on Superman; the special effects are rather crude at times; and it can certainly get rather silly and campy.  But look past the flaws, and enjoy it for what it is.  It's meant to be basically a romantic comedy, and it's focus is squarely, as the title suggests, upon the relationship between Lois and Clark, and it's evolution from a friendly rivalry, and an ironic love triangle (with Clark as his own rival), into a romance.  It's a great take on the classic American hero, and well worth watching.",5,My favorite Superman on film.,1257724800,"11 9, 2009",2009,7361,"['hard', 'admit', 'actually', 'prefer', 'adaptation',

I was 15 at the time, and I remember eagerly tunning in each Sunday night to watch.I had never been a big fan of superman personally, having grown up with Xmen comics and Marvel, I never did read many DC comics.  However, this show really brought something special to the Superman mythos- it brought a sense of the characters as being real people.  It was great to see such great character portrayals by Terri and Dean.  Their chemistry was obvious and they played their role to perfection.  The initial love/hate relationship of the first season was so well done, it kept me on the edge of my seat thinking, when is she going to find out?  I still remember that one episode where he grabs her and Jimmy (it was also in the TV intro at one point) and flies them as a bomb explosdes in the background; she still didn't put two and two together, and accepted his excuse that the bomb's explosion must have propelled them like that. Haha, it was great.The supporting cast was the best I've seen, with Perry White played to perfection. The constant Elvis references by Perry were truly funny.  Cat was ok, but she was largely forgetfull, since I was only reminded she was in the show by reading another reviewer.  Jimmy had two actors play him; I'm not sure who was better, but let's just say they both, in their way, hit Jimmy right on the head.Unfortunately, I didn't get to see much of the last parts of season 3 and 4, because at that time I had gone off to college.  But hopefully the WB will release all seaons of this show.Lately, I've been running out of stuff to buy (TV series wise) because it seems all the great shows I loved, I either already bought, or have not been released.  This makes me sad, considering the appaling number of dumb old TV shows that are being released.  WB is pretty good at releasing dvds, unlike Fox, which I'm still hating since they have not released ""Space: Above and Beyond"" yet and don't seem to have any plans to do so.Anyway, I want to buy this show. I never had the foresight to tape the show, and thus, I have not seen it in almost ten years.  I still remember many of the episodes, and who can forget the pilot, where Clark leaves that hand print on the bus.

If you're even considering this, it's not because you're either a die hard television fan, or comic fan.  It's because secretly, you always wanted to see Lois and Clark get it on.  Well look no further, my friend!  You have found it!The production value isn't bad (it's not very good, either), the writing is at least above average, and the acting is almost tongue in cheek.

Now I'm a huge superman fan, and Dean Cain juuust doesn't cut it as Superman or clark Kent. Now I know that Clark is who he is, and Superman is just a part he plays. But still, you're playing the most powerful being on earth. And He just doesn't quite carry it through, Now Christopher Reeves, and Gerard Christopher played both Superman and Superboy to a T. Having finished Season one, the only thing that saves it is John Shea, who played Lex Luthor. Now, to disagree with a reviewer, Perry was obsessed with Elvis, in the comic books. Again, having watched season one, and even starting season two. It juust doesn't quite, well I'll put it this way. As one person said, I understand that they wanted to focus on Lois and Clark. But you can't leave out Superman, also. My biggest problem. LOIS GETS IN TROUBLE ALL THE TIME!!!!, I counted one maybe two episodes where Lois wasn't kidnapped, shot at, or just in trouble. It got old real fast, just like smallville. At some point someone has to ask clark why he's always there to rescue everybody, here it's why don't you move away to a different city. Again, to me, John shea saved season one. His Lex Luthor was awsome, really the only bright spot for season one. I give it two stars only for John Shea, nothing else.

897852,A25UZ7MA72SMKM,B00080ZG2O,Brent Butler,"[1, 1]","My wife and I always enjoyed this series back when it ran live. Terri Hatcher was an attractive, yet suitably bossy and bitchy Lois Lane, straight out of the mold of the 1978 movie. Dean Cain made a remarkably personable Clark Kent. He has a wonderfully expressive face, and could literally crack us up with the well timed raise of an eyebrow. In addition, Lane Smith nailed Perry White, the demanding and bombastic editor of the Daily Planet.While the series is dated compared to modern technology, the Superman special effects hold up very well, as does the visual presentation of these shows. They are bright and colorful, and remarkably crisp considering that these are DVDs and we are now spoiled to Blu ray resolution.The pilot episode does a very nice job of introducing Clark Kent, and displaying some of his powers bit by bit. At this stage he hasn't even decided to become a ""super hero"" ... he's got these awesome powers, but his parents are more worried about him being discovered and spending the rest of his life as a lab subject. A sequence at the end of the pilot where ""Ma Kent"" is sewing a variety of candidate super hero costumes for him to try on is laugh out loud funny. The actors came into the pilot with these characters fully developed in their heads, and the early portrayal of our favorite Metropolis group is not only fulfilling in terms of our expectations for the roles, but is remarkably true to the long term portrayals ... something not always easily accomplished for the early stages of a TV series.The stories in these episodes are classics that often seem to come right out of the pages of the comic books. These shows are also fun in that Clark Kent has to use his brain fully as much as his brawn (and other powers) to solve the mysteries and problems which confront him.You can find all of these seasons at bargain prices now, which makes collecting them a no-brainer if you were fans of the series, or the ""Superman set"" in general. One of the bonuses for us is that this series ran before we had a DVR available, so I'm sure we missed a show from time to time which we can pleasantly discover as we go through these seasons.Highly recommended.",5,A lot of fun,1326758400,"01 17, 2012",2012,2184,"['wife', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'back', 'when', 'ran', 'live', 'Terri', 'Hatcher', 'was', 'attractive', 'yet', 'suitably', 'bossy', 'bitchy', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'straight', 'mold', '1978', 'movie', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'made', 'remarkably', 'personable', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'wonderfully', 'expressive', 'face', 'could', 'literally', 'crack', 'up', 'well', 'timed', 'raise', 'eyebrow', 'addition', 'Lane', 'Smith', 'nailed', 'Perry', 'White', 'demanding', 'bombastic', 'editor', 'Daily', 'Planet.While', 'series', 'dated', 'compared', 'modern', 'technology', 'Superman', 'special', 'effects', 'hold', 'up', 'very', 'well', 'visual', 'presentation', 'shows', 'are', 'bright', 'colorful', 'remarkably', 'crisp', 'considering', 'are', 'DVDs', 'are', 'now', 'spoiled', 'Blu', 'ray', 'resolution.The', 'pilot', 'episode', 'very', 'nice', 'job', 'introducing', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'displaying', 'powers', 'bit', 'bit', 'stage', ""n't"", 'even', 'decided', 'become', 'super', 'hero', 'got', 'awesome', 'powers', 'parents', 'are', 'more', 'worried', 'being', 'discovered', 'spending', 'rest', 'life', 'lab', 'subject', 'sequence', 'end', 'pilot', 'where', 'Ma', 'Kent', 'sewing', 'variety', 'candidate', 'super', 'hero', 'costumes', 'try', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'funny', 'actors', 'came', 'pilot', 'characters', 'fully', 'developed', 'heads', 'early', 'portrayal', 'favorite', 'Metropolis', 'group', 'not', 'only', 'fulfilling', 'terms', 'expectations', 'roles', 'remarkably', 'true', 'long', 'term', 'portrayals', 'something', 'not', 'always', 'easily', 'accomplished', 'early', 'stages', 'TV', 'series.The', 'stories', 'episodes', 'are', 'classics', 'often', 'seem', 'come', 'right', 'pages', 'comic', 'books', 'shows', 'are', 'also', 'fun', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'use', 'brain', 'fully', 'as', 'much', 'brawn', 'other', 'powers', 'solve', 'mysteries', 'problems', 'confront', 'him.You', 'can', 'find', 'seasons', 'bargain', 'prices', 'now', 'collecting', 'no-brainer', 'were', 'fans', 'series', 'Superman', 'set', 'general', 'One', 'bonuses', 'series', 'ran', 'had', 'DVR', 'available', ""'m"", 'sure', 'missed', 'show', 'time', 'time', 'can', 'pleasantly', 'discover', 'go', 'seasons.Highly', 'recommended']",Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman: Season 1

I remember thinking that Dean Cain was just not my idea of how Superman should look, but I got over that about 30 seconds into the pilot on DVD. Dean is delicious in tights and makes a great Superman! But he's even better as Clark Kent.

""The Adventures of Superman"" from the 50s with George Reeves, ""Superboy"", produced by the Salkind brothers and inspired by the success of the Christopher Reeve Superman films from the 80s, ""Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman"" from the 90s, and ""Smallville"" from decade 2000. Of these four, ""Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman"", had the psychologically deepest, most relatable, modern, and eccentric interpretations of the classic Superman characters (Clark Kent, Lois Lane, and Lex Luthor) seen on the small screen. Each is immature and neurotic in their own unique way. Lois, is a neurotic, romantically repressed, feminist snob living out the modern woman's dream; Clark Kent is a developmentally stunted mama's boy, living out his inner kid as Superman; Luthor is a pleasure seeking, manipulative, utilitarian, megalomaniac whose ego knows no boundaries. Each live action Superman series had its characteristic strengths and weaknesses. For ""Lois and Clark"", I'd say the strengths were the characters and the humor of the character interactions. ""Lois and Clark"", didn't feel like a traditional Superman series with stock bad guys, and Lois or Jimmy getting into trouble every episode, and needing Superman to bail them out like a good insurance policy.

That is a great show comes as a surprise to me, because I never watched it when it ran on TV and didn't much care when it came out on DVD. But from episode one I was completely hooked. The production values are cheesy, the plots silly, and most of the acting second-rate (Morgan Fairchild, oh brother) but the series soars on the chemistry of Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher as Clark Kent and Lois Lane, old school intrepid reporters.We lovers of romantic comedy demand only two things; that a series should be romantic and that it should be funny. Apparently this is a lot to ask because the humor in ""Lois and Clark"" and the sweet and gentle romance is so unusual the show completely absorbed me and my weekend. Hatcher and Cain carry episode after episode with their banter and apparently genuine pleasure in each other's presence. Also worth noting is John Shea as Lex Luthor; it takes a good actor to give off the aura of wealth when the sets aren't helping him. My favorite episodes this season are ""Honeymoon in Metropolis"" with Lois and Clark undercover as newlyweds, ""Witness"" (wish a man would be so worried about me he slept on a bench outside MY apartment) and ""Pheromone My Lovely"" , which was pretty much ripped off intact for a recent ""Smallville"".Who'd have thunk it: A perky Lois who can take care of herself (karate!) and a Clark who, as my sister pointed out, is actually sexier than Superman.

897859,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B00080ZG2O,Cubist,"[6, 8]","Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman came along at a time when Superman's popularity was at a low. It had been ages since a movie had come out (the abysmal Superman IV: The Quest for Peace in 1987). At the time, Time Warner had absorbed DC Comics and decided to resurrect the superhero but on TV instead of on the big screen. The network brought in Deborah Joy LeVine (who had very little TV experience at the time) to create and write the show's feature-length pilot episode. She hadn't even read a Superman comic before and envisioned a Moonlighting-style romantic comedy.The show featured two new, fresh-faced talents, Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher and managed to maintain the homogenous utopia of the Christopher Reeves' movies. Everyone looks good, nobody seems to have any real problems (like paying rent or finding a job) and good and evil are easily identifiable. But that is kind of the point, right down to the city streets that are always clean and uncluttered-obviously shot on a soundstage. This is purely escapist fare for one to lose themselves in. Lois and Clark presents an idealized world as opposed to a realistic one.Lois may be a tough-as-nails reporter but deep down she's a hopeless romantic at heart. Hatcher brings a sexy, girl-next-door vibe coupled with good comic timing (that she showcases to an even greater degree on Desperate Housewives) that catapulted her to fame when the show originally aired. She's gorgeous but also conveys a vulnerability that makes her endearing. Like WKRP in Cincinnati, Lois and Clark plays up the overt sexuality of ""Cat"" Grant (Scoggins) as the show's promiscuous bombshell when it is painfully obvious that it is Lois who is the real knockout (and has integrity as well).Cain wisely doesn't try to copy Reeves' iconic performance from the movies but portrays Clark as a smart and idealistic guy who is the perfect foil for Hatcher's headstrong Lois. He has an engaging smile and all-American good looks that makes him ideal for the role. Cain doesn't have too much range but the role, as written, doesn't require much of him. The chemistry between him and Hatcher feels genuine and is definitely the appeal of the show. The give-and-take between them is cute and there is obviously some heat, some sexual tension brewing under the surface.Ultimately, Lois and Clark is all about upholding strong, moral values and decency. This is represented most obviously with Clark's, straight-from-America's-heartland parents juxtaposed with the cynical, big city as represented by Lois and Perry White. The show attempts to demonstrate that some kind of harmony can exist between these two worldviews but when push comes to shove, it sides with the folksy, sage advice of the folks from Smallville.The first DVD features an audio commentary on the ""Pilot"" episode by Dean Cain, executive producer LeVine and director Robert Butler. LeVine dominates the track as she talks about how the episode was supposed to establish Lois and Clark's personalities and their relationship (i.e. sexual tension). Cain is modest and talks about his experiences during the casting process and shooting this episode.LeVine didn't want to alienate Superman fans but also wanted to do something different with the character. To test the waters so to speak, she cut a 20-minute reel from the pilot episode and showed it to fans at that year's San Diego Comic Con. This is footage is included on the DVD.On the sixth DVD is a fine retrospective featurette entitled, ""From Rivals to Romance: the making of `Lois and Clark.'"" Cain and Hatcher appear in brand new interviews along with most of the other main cast members. Cain almost didn't get the role because the powers that be thought he was too young. LeVine wanted Lois to be a modern woman with a lousy social life and Hatcher liked her character's duality: tough exterior with a needy, romantic interior.Finally, there is ""Taking Flight: the Visual Effects of `Lois and Clark'"" that takes a look at how the show's special effects were created. Not surprisingly, both Cain and Hatcher found the wire harness to be a painful experience.",4,Moonlighting in tights,1118880000,"06 16, 2005",2005,4125,"['Lois', 'Clark', 'New', 'Adventures', 'Superman', 'came', 'along', 'time', 'when', 'Superman', 'popularity', 'was', 'low', 'had', 'been', 'ages', 'movie', 'had', 'come', 'out', 'abysmal', 'Superman', 'IV', 'Quest', 'Peace', '1987', 'time', 'Time', 'Warner', 'had', 'absorbed', 'DC', 'Comics', 'decided', 'resurrect', 'superhero', 'TV', 'instead', 'big', 'screen', 'network', 'brought', 'Deborah', 'Joy', 'LeVine', 'who', 'had', 'very', 'little', 'TV', 'experience', 'time', 'create', 'write', 'show', 'feature-length', 'pilot', 'episode', 'had', ""n't"", 'even', 'read', 'Superman', 'comic', 'envisioned', 'Moonlighting-style', 'romantic', 'comedy.The', 'show', 'featured', 'two', 'new', 'fresh-faced', 'talents', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'Teri', 'Hatcher', 'managed', 'maintain', 'homogenous', 'utopia', 'Christopher', 'Reeves', 'movies', 'Everyone', 'good', 'nobody', 'have', 'real', 'problems', 'paying', 'rent', 'finding', 'job', 'good', 'evil', 'are', 'easily', 'identifiable', 'kind', 'point', 'right', 'down', 'city', 'streets', 'are', 'always', 'clean', 'uncluttered-obviously', 'shot', 'soundstage', 'purely', 'escapist', 'fare', 'one', 'lose', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'idealized', 'world', 'opposed', 'realistic', 'one.Lois', 'may', 'be', 'tough-as-nails', 'reporter', 'deep', 'hopeless', 'romantic', 'heart', 'Hatcher', 'sexy', 'girl-next-door', 'vibe', 'coupled', 'good', 'comic', 'timing', 'even', 'greater', 'degree', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'catapulted', 'fame', 'when', 'show', 'originally', 'aired', 'gorgeous', 'also', 'vulnerability', 'endearing', 'WKRP', 'Cincinnati', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'up', 'overt', 'sexuality', 'Cat', 'Grant', 'Scoggins', 'show', 'promiscuous', 'bombshell', 'when', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'Lois', 'who', 'real', 'knockout', 'integrity', 'as', 'well', '.Cain', 'wisely', ""n't"", 'try', 'copy', 'Reeves', 'iconic', 'performance', 'movies', 'Clark', 'smart', 'idealistic', 'guy', 'who', 'perfect', 'foil', 'Hatcher', 'headstrong', 'Lois', 'engaging', 'smile', 'all-American', 'good', 'looks', 'ideal', 'role', 'Cain', ""n't"", 'have', 'too', 'much', 'range', 'role', 'written', ""n't"", 'require', 'much', 'chemistry', 'Hatcher', 'feels', 'genuine', 'definitely', 'appeal', 'show', 'give-and-take', 'cute', 'obviously', 'heat', 'sexual', 'tension', 'brewing', 'surface.Ultimately', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'upholding', 'strong', 'moral', 'values', 'decency', 'represented', 'most', 'obviously', 'Clark', ""straight-from-America's-heartland"", 'parents', 'juxtaposed', 'cynical', 'big', 'city', 'represented', 'Lois', 'Perry', 'White', 'show', 'demonstrate', 'kind', 'harmony', 'can', 'exist', 'two', 'worldviews', 'when', 'push', 'shove', 'sides', 'folksy', 'sage', 'advice', 'folks', 'Smallville.The', 'first', 'DVD', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Pilot', 'episode', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'executive', 'producer', 'LeVine', 'director', 'Robert', 'Butler', 'LeVine', 'track', 'how', 'episode', 'was', 'supposed', 'establish', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'personalities', 'relationship', 'i.e', 'sexual', 'tension', 'Cain', 'modest', 'talks', 'experiences', 'casting', 'process', 'shooting', 'episode.LeVine', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'alienate', 'Superman', 'fans', 'also', 'wanted', 'do', 'something', 'different', 'character', 'test', 'waters', 'so', 'speak', 'cut', '20-minute', 'reel', 'pilot', 'episode', 'showed', 'fans', 'year', 'San', 'Diego', 'Comic', 'Con', 'footage', 'included', 'DVD.On', 'sixth', 'DVD', 'fine', 'retrospective', 'featurette', 'entitled', 'Rivals', 'Romance', 'making', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'Cain', 'Hatcher', 'appear', 'brand', 'new', 'interviews', 'most', 'other', 'main', 'cast', 'members', 'Cain', 'almost', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'role', 'powers', 'be', 'thought', 'was', 'too', 'young', 'LeVine', 'wanted', 'Lois', 'be', 'modern', 'woman', 'lousy', 'social', 'life', 'Hatcher', 'liked', 'character', 'duality', 'tough', 'exterior', 'needy', 'romantic', 'interior.Finally', 'Taking', 'Flight', 'Visual', 'Effects', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'look', 'how', 'show', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'created', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'Cain', 'Hatcher', 'found', 'wire', 'harness', 'be', 'painful', 'experience']",Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman: Season 1

897864,A3RTMB76CJWY9U,B00080ZG2O,DonAthos,"[6, 7]","Lois & Clark is an interesting re-telling of the Superman mythos.Unlike the films, the original black and white series or Smallville, Lois & Clark strives to be a light-hearted, romance comedy. Also, instead of being ""about Superman,"" it's actually about the two title characters--this is a series about Lois & Clark, and their relationship; Superman usually just shows up near the end. I like this change in perspective. It's neat to really see the man behind the Man of Steel, for a change, and shows that ""Clark Kent is who he is, Superman is what he does.""Concept aside, the execution is here and there. The acting runs the gamut. Cain and Hatcher are both great-looking people, and usually when people talk about this show, that's what they'll bring up. Their acting? Passable, but not brilliant, though I will say that Hatcher plays Lois Lane just about how I think she ought to be played. Cain's Clark Kent is a bit of a mold-breaker, because he's not the quiet, shy, nerdy Kent of Christopher Reeve--he plays Kent as a romantic, leading man. I still don't know quite what I think about that.John Shea is a wonderful actor. That said, his Luthor doesn't quite stand out among a group of wonderful characterizations we've had over the last several years, including Gene Hackman, Kevin Spacey, and (the best thus far), Michael Rosenbaum. Shea's Luthor is okay, but it's wonderful how the series sets Luthor up as a romantic villain as much as anything else, as the third point in a triangle between our two heroes. Brilliant.Disappointments in the casting include whatever the kid's name who plays Jimmy Olsen (though I've been told he gets replaced for the following seasons, and good riddance), and the horrible, horrible actress and character of Tracy Scoggins. She's neither a good actress nor attractive, her character adds nothing to the series, and I really have to wonder who she was, er, ""dating"" to land this gig.Finally, it must be said that Lane Smith is just about perfect as Perry White. There's no better Perry White in any medium, and I can't imagine there would be; he owns this role, and the series is worth watching almost for him alone.The episodes themselves are hit and miss, some being interesting and some being kind of boring. There is a slow plot progression in the background, as Clark learns about his Kryptonian background and Lex Luthor struggles harder and harder against his nemesis, Superman. It culminates in a wonderful two-part conclusion with a shocking finish.... I really wonder where they're going from there.All in all, this isn't a perfect series, but it has enough strengths to be recommended (and particularly for fans of the Superman franchise). The primary fame of the series always seems to have been how hot Dean Cain is, or Teri Hatcher, or something like that. Fine, they're hot. But that's not why this show is fun to watch; it's fun, and interesting, for being a different sort of look at these iconic characters, featuring some standout characterizations and some nifty episodes.

The answer is a resounding YES, YES, YES. Deborah Joy Levine has recreated Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster's immortal comic book hero for a new generation. Gone is Lex Luthor, mad scientist with a bald head. Gone is Lois Lane, typical damsel-in-distress. Gone is Perry White, ""Great Caesar's Gohst."" But...never fear, die-hard ""Superman"" fans, all is not lost. Lex Luthor, Lois Lane and Perry White are only a few of the characters that have been updated in this family-friendly television series. As it was shot for ABC, the show was very family friendly, with only some suggestive dialogue, but that's as far is it got (at least for Season 1; I've yet to buy Seasons 2-4, as I wasn't allowed to see all the episodes of this wonderful series, but then again, I was only 7 years old). No graphic violence, no swearing and no sexual content. Today's shows, unfortunately, are very raunchy, and you can almost not find a wholesome family program (unless you have TVLand, where you'll constantly find reruns of ""I Love Lucy,"" ""Hogan's Heroes"" and the classic favourite ""The Andy Griffith Show."") Why is is that Disney's 1957-1959 television series ""Zorro"" isn't rerun anymore? Or The Three Stooges' shorts? Or ""Touched By An Angel""? Or ""New World Zorro""? Or this excellent show? All of these television shows were family-friendly. But I digress.Thwe first season of this show is HIGH-FLYING FUN. I especially liked the banter between Lois, Clark and Cat. The bickering that went on was never risque. I also love ""Foundling."" Very well-written scene where Lois and Clark face off about his having lied to Lois. Every episode of the first season is excellent. I can't wait to get the rest of the seasons. The bonus features aren't as many as I thought, but everything is there: interviews with Dean Cain, Teri Hatcher, John Shea, Tracy Scoggins, K Callan, Eddie Jones, Deborah Joy Levine, Robert Butler and a few of the behind-the scenes technicians. I also highly recommend the commentary on the pilot, as well as the series presentation andf introduction to the pilot by Ms. Levine. ""It's a bird, it's a plane. No, it's...SUPERMAN.""

Teri Hatcher is my idea of the REAL comic book Lois Lane and Dean Cain is such a wonderful Clark Kent alias Superman.  They have a great chemistry and most of the episodes are pure fun and often funny and so very, very well written and filmed.  I also liked the way Dean Cain would look at the audience with a certain look and make you feel part of the action.  This version has Clark's parents (Mom AND Dad)whom he actually consults with.  I recommend this for anyone who loves Superman, liked the old Superman series with George Reeves, and enjoys a good romantic comedy which includes a really super, super hero and a remarkably wonderful Clark Kent, and a beautiful, savvy, take-charge Lois Lane!!  And then, there's a really handsome but chilling Lex Luther who is able to mask his evil side from everyone except Clark/Superman AND the audience.  Lex is even more formidable because he gets away with so much, and Lois actually almost falls for him!! Perry White is AOK as are Jimmy Olsen, Cat, and Inspector Henderson.  I missed the series when it originally aired on television and have not seen the other seasons, but I have nothing but praise for Lois and Clark, Season I--the best Superman series ever!! Deborah Joy Levine has made this Superman adaptation even better than the original television series from the 50's starring George Reeves -- this should clue you in.

I thought of it as just a lame soap opera that just focuses on the relationship of Lois and Clark. Now that I bought season 1 and 2, I see that it's much much more. When watching Smallvile, I used to think that it makes Lois and Clark look like [...] but it's really the other way around I realize now. I mean Smallvile, I realize now is what's really like a soap opera. When it has a chance to tell a great story, it just focuses on the Clark and Lana relationship when we've been taught a thousand times that they can never ever ever be together. So why keep showing us that ? We don't need any more proof. Now that it has a Clark, Lana and Lex love triangle it's even worse because it reminds me of the Dawson, Joey and Pacey love triangle in Dawson's Creek. So I now realize that Smallville is much more of a soap opera.Lois and Clark has villians of the week like Smallville but the creators are a lot more creative. I mean we've seen how many villians in Smallvile who got their powers from kryptonite. They've used krpytonite for everything possible in Smallville. Kryptonite bullets, kryptonite drugs that Lana was on recently ""rolls eyes lol"". They've used krptonite for so much that in season 6 I predict that someone will try to kill Clark with krpytonie toilot paper...lol. Anyway in Lois and Clark they have bad guys who are a lot more clever and out smart Superman without...krpytonite.The special effects maybe totally corny compared to Smallville's or even the original Superman movies but still if you can look passed that this show is a good time. It has a sense of humor and lets face it...Smallville needs more of a sense of humor sometimes. This show has a good cast too. I love the late great Lane Smith as Lois and Clark's boss Perry White who's obsessed with Elvis. He's possibly even my favorite Perry White. While John Shea (Mutant X) also steals the show as Lex Luther. I also liked Michael Landes (Final Destination 2) as Jimmy Olson in season 1 but he gets replaced by Justin Whalin (Dungeons and Dragons) in the following seasons. To me Landes was the better Olson, just my opinion lol.I'm now watching season 2 and to me the show really picks up then. Although this season is pretty good, esecially the finale where Lois almost makes the mistake of marrying Lex Luther despite everyone telling her it's a huge mistake. Also  Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher have chemestry and aren't always crying together and constantly talking about how they can't be together like...Clark and Lana in Smallville. Lets face it, that's about all we get from Clark and Lana.  With all the times Clark has saved Lana with  her knocked out so she can't see him use his powers. She would either be dead, in a coma or have a serious concussion lol. So thank you Smallville for making Lois and Clark look better and better.

Season One stuck to what a Superman TV should be about. Lois/Clark and the evil Lex Luthor.Season One Box set offers a lot. Sadly, last looks at departed Lane Smith as the best Perry White ever. This season also had the cool Cat (Catherine Grant) to be a foil for Lois. Michael Landes wasn't my favorite Jimmy Olsen (I liked his successor much better) but looking back at these DVDs he was fun and could either play the straight man or funny whenever he was called to do either.John Shea made a menacing Lex Luthor. It just seemed like the writers couldn't come up with much for him after this first season. He had potential to be so much more than what he ended up doing after Season One.The Kents (Martha & Jonathan) were Ok for the time in which this show ran. I much prefer John Schneider and O'nette Otoole as the Kents on Smallville. They add dimensions to the show that these Kents didn't or couldn't because of how they were written.The best episodes featured Lex Luthor bringing a somewhat serious threat against Superman and coming between Lois & Clark.Honeymoon In Metropolis stands out as one of the most romantic episodes with Lois & Clark going on stakeout and having to be together in a honeymoon suite.All Shook Up is another nice episode where Superman gets amnesia.The Green, Green Glow Of Home is one of the few episodes to feature Smallville outside of the Kent Farm. Unfortunately it is not the likeable Smallville from the current TV show, but it is a relatively fun episode.Pheremone, My Lovely is a great episode in which the bad guy (or girl) is less deadly and actually causes a lot of funny things to happen. This is Cat's best episode and Teri Hatcher is steaming hot as (Lois) she tries to seduce Clark.Vatman stands out as a Superman vs Superman episode. Unfortunately they didn't call him Bizarro, but at least they used him. Here is where the writers tended to mess up with a huge villians gallery. Vatman was a pretty bad title as well. Why not just Bizarre, or Bizzaro?Fly Hard was pretty nice in that it was based pretty much on Die Hard. Clark had to find a way to protect Lois/Perry/Jimmy & Lex without revealing he was Superman. It was a challange because they were all stuck in a room for the majority of the episode.The House Of Luthor brought to a head the romance between Lex &  Lois. It left a lot up in the air to look forward to Season Two.Overall if you liked Lois & Clark at all you should love this season. It was the best. Before Teri Hatcher cut her hair way too short. Before Lois and Clark got together and ruined the romantic/sexual tension that was as important to the show as it was to Moonlighting. Before Lex disappeared/reappeared and disappeared again. John Shea was missed in future seasons as was Cat she added sexual tension to the show that was missed when she was gone. Also this season was before cast members came and went or were replaced with different people confusing the viewers.The storylines were basically about Clark/Lois and or Lex and of course Superman. The supporting cast picked up the rest and kept this show top notch in the first season. The same couldn't be said about future seasons when the show got too silly/campy and lost all bit of reality it had in season one. Buy this set if you loved the show. You won't regret it.

The quality of the screenwriting is refreshing, bold and mature, light-hearted, honest and romantic. From the start we know that this show has been made unashamedly and unapologetically to appeal to both women and men, whether straight or gay. First class adult-oriented, yet child-friendly entertainment.The quality of the video is fantastic - with only a few scenes in the first two series showing the limitations of the editing equipment of the time. Just as you can see with each season how rapidly the Daily Planet's office computer systems have progressed, by season three the video quality is as good as anything we see today. Throughout the entire series the audio is, to my picky ears, impressively detailed and damned near flawless.I love Dean Cain in this role - and also for his marvellous performance as the guilt-free gay bimbo Cole in ""The Broken Hearts Club"". Teri Hatcher also amazes me with the breadth of character that she brings to Lois - while creating a completely different style of person for her role in Desperate Housewives.The extra features for each season are also a genuine treat and I greatly appreciate the work that's gone into them.BTW: check out the amazing collection of ties worn by Clark Kent - every one of them worthy of a place in the costuming hall of fame.",5,"pure class, great entertainment, superb DVD quality",1242432000,"05 16, 2009",2009,1381,"['been', 'wonderful', 'experience', 'enjoy', 'entire', 'set', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'DVD', 'quality', 'screenwriting', 'refreshing', 'bold', 'mature', 'light-hearted', 'honest', 'romantic', 'start', 'know', 'show', 'been', 'made', 'unashamedly', 'unapologetically', 'appeal', 'women', 'men', 'straight', 'gay', 'First', 'class', 'adult-oriented', 'yet', 'child-friendly', 'entertainment.The', 'quality', 'video', 'fantastic', 'only', 'few', 'scenes', 'first', 'two', 'series', 'showing', 'limitations', 'editing', 'equipment', 'time', 'Just', 'can', 'see', 'season', 'how', 'rapidly', 'Daily', 'Planet', 'office', 'computer', 'systems', 'have', 'progressed', 'season', 'three', 'video', 'quality', 'as', 'good', 'anything', 'see', 'today', 'entire', 'series', 'audio', 'picky', 'ears', 'impressively', 'detailed', 'damned', 'flawless.I', 'love', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'role', 'also', 'marvellous', 'performance', 'guilt-free', 'gay', 'bimbo', 'Cole', 'Broken', 'Hearts', 'Club', 'Teri', 'Hatcher', 'also', 'breadth', 'character', 'Lois', 'creating', 'completely', 'different', 'style', 'person', 'role', 'Desperate', 'Housewives.The', 'extra', 'features', 'season', 'are', 'also', 'genuine', 'treat', 'greatly', 'appreciate', 'work', 'gone', 'them.BTW', 'check', 'out', 'amazing', 'collection', 'ties', 'worn', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'one', 'worthy', 'place', 'costuming', 'hall', 'fame']",Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman: Season 1
897882,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B00080ZG2O,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[6, 14]","After 4 movies throughout the 1970's and 1980's, Superman seemed to have vanished from the realm of TV or movies.  So fans were thrilled when it was announced that Warner Brothers was making an hour long weekly drama series based on the 'Man of Steel'.  With this new series Warner Brothers was also quick to point out that this was going to be a slightly different take on the iconic hero, true there would be the classic costume, and plenty of special effects and action sequences, but the main drive of the show would be the relationship between Superman's alter-ego, Clark Kent and his future love, Lois Lane.  This made some fans nervous, because they wondered will it stay true to the comic roots or just go off on its own, the answer was, a little of both.  But when the series premiered to huge ratings it looked as if Superman was back and better than ever and ABC had a winner on their hands, with ""Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman"".However, as good as the first episode was the show quickly spun out of control in terms of serious drama with some comedy, and became more of a comedy hour that focused less on Clark Kent and Superman (Dean Cain), and more on their lovely co-star Lois Lane as brought to life by actress Teri Hatcher.  Story lines were more humorous than they should have been, and the villains were never that threatening, and even Lex Luthor wasn't as intimidating as he should have been.The aspect of the show that was always strongest was the acting, all of the cast members were very good in their respective roles, especially Teri Hatcher as a more modern Lois Lane, and Dean Cain as Superman, his take on Clark Kent was too macho for the role.  The problem with Dean Cain is that he played Clark almost identical to Superman, so there really was no differentiating the two characters other than by use of powers and clothes.  Also, a choice made by the producers of this show that served as a semi-slap in the face to fans of Superman, was the fact that they made Clark Kent's hair have the classic 'S'-curl, and Superman's hair was always slicked back, when in the comics it's always been the other way around.  This wouldn't have bothered me so much, except it was intentional, showing the lack of respect the production team had for the source material, in my opinion at least.Truthfully, I liked the first episode and a few others here and there, but by the end of the first season I would catch a few episodes at a time, but was never a devout viewer, and based on what I've heard from other people I wasn't missing much.  Sadly, this show that had so much promise, failed on so many levels.  If you're a fan of Superman and would like some good television based on the character you may want to look at the season box sets of ""Smallville"" (seasons 1-4 are available on DVD) or the first season of ""Superman: The Animated Series"" (from the creators of ""Batman: The Animated Series""), both shows are terrific.If you're still interested in ""Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman"", in todays television rating system, this show would receive at most a TV-PG, so it is safe for the whole family to watch.  And as I said, there were several good episodes, and who knows you may just love it after all and think I'm completely off-base, and that's possible, though I doubt it will happen with this show.",3,Superman Re-imagined and Not Always For the Better...,1131926400,"11 14, 2005",2005,3354,"['4', 'movies', '1970', '1980', 'Superman', 'seemed', 'have', 'vanished', 'realm', 'TV', 'movies', 'So', 'fans', 'were', 'thrilled', 'when', 'was', 'announced', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'was', 'making', 'hour', 'long', 'weekly', 'drama', 'series', 'based', ""'Man"", 'Steel', 'new', 'series', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'was', 'also', 'quick', 'point', 'out', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'slightly', 'different', 'take', 'iconic', 'hero', 'true', 'would', 'be', 'classic', 'costume', 'plenty', 'special', 'effects', 'action', 'sequences', 'main', 'drive', 'show', 'would', 'be', 'relationship', 'Superman', 'alter-ego', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'future', 'love', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'made', 'fans', 'nervous', 'wondered', 'will', 'stay', 'true', 'comic', 'roots', 'just', 'go', 'off', 'own', 'answer', 'was', 'little', 'when', 'series', 'premiered', 'huge', 'ratings', 'looked', 'Superman', 'was', 'back', 'better', 'ever', 'ABC', 'had', 'winner', 'hands', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'New', 'Adventures', 'Superman', '.However', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'episode', 'was', 'show', 'quickly', 'spun', 'control', 'terms', 'serious', 'drama', 'comedy', 'became', 'more', 'comedy', 'hour', 'focused', 'less', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'Superman', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'more', 'lovely', 'co-star', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'brought', 'life', 'actress', 'Teri', 'Hatcher', 'Story', 'lines', 'were', 'more', 'humorous', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'villains', 'were', 'never', 'threatening', 'even', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'intimidating', 'should', 'have', 'been.The', 'aspect', 'show', 'was', 'always', 'strongest', 'was', 'acting', 'cast', 'members', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'respective', 'roles', 'especially', 'Teri', 'Hatcher', 'more', 'modern', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'Superman', 'take', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'was', 'too', 'macho', 'role', 'problem', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'played', 'Clark', 'almost', 'identical', 'Superman', 'so', 'really', 'was', 'differentiating', 'two', 'characters', 'other', 'use', 'powers', 'clothes', 'Also', 'choice', 'made', 'producers', 'show', 'served', 'semi-slap', 'face', 'fans', 'Superman', 'was', 'fact', 'made', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'hair', 'have', 'classic', ""'S'-curl"", 'Superman', 'hair', 'was', 'always', 'slicked', 'back', 'when', 'comics', 'always', 'been', 'other', 'way', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'bothered', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'intentional', 'showing', 'lack', 'respect', 'production', 'team', 'had', 'source', 'material', 'opinion', 'least.Truthfully', 'liked', 'first', 'episode', 'few', 'others', 'here', 'there', 'end', 'first', 'season', 'would', 'catch', 'few', 'episodes', 'time', 'was', 'never', 'devout', 'viewer', 'based', 'what', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'other', 'people', 'was', ""n't"", 'missing', 'much', 'Sadly', 'show', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'promise', 'failed', 'many', 'levels', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Superman', 'would', 'like', 'good', 'television', 'based', 'character', 'may', 'want', 'look', 'season', 'box', 'sets', 'Smallville', 'seasons', '1-4', 'are', 'available', 'DVD', 'first', 'season', 'Superman', 'Animated', 'Series', 'creators', 'Batman', 'Animated', 'Series', 'shows', 'are', ""'re"", 'still', 'interested', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'New', 'Adventures', 'Superman', 'todays', 'television', 'rating', 'system', 'show', 'would', 'receive', 'most', 'TV-PG', 'safe', 'whole', 'family', 'watch', 'said', 'were', 'several', 'good', 'episodes', 'who', 'may', 'just', 'love', 'think', ""'m"", 'completely', 'off-base', 'possible', 'doubt', 'will', 'happen', 'show']",Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman: Season 1

Blake 2""","[1, 3]","I have to admit something up front- I did not watch Lois and Clark when it was on - mainly because I am a sci-fi snob and had a really tough time with the incredibly cheesy special effects. Lois and Clark premiered the same year as the X-files, and the next year ER and Friends premiered. I never got into the show- I loved the SUperman movies with Christopher Reeve and had a tough time accepting Dean Cain as Clark Kent.Fast forward- I have watched Smallville now for some time having got hooked on the DVDs and then watching first run epis last year when SUpernatural moved to Thursdays after it. I love the interaction between Tom Welling and Erica Durance as Lois and Clark.I was told that much of the banter and styling for their relationship was lifted from LOIS and CLARK. Thus this review.I find the show now to be utterly charming! Terry Hatcher as Lois is tough, savvy and still a little vulnerable- but only with Clark or her sister. Clark? He has a wonderful relationship with his parents- I love the L&C; interpretation of Martha as a bit of a kooky overgrown hippy artsy type and Clark is definitely not the nerd of the past- more a little shy and not always certain of things , but with Lois he is witty and smart and other women see his brawn and good clean cut looks right away.Tracy Scoggins as Kat is a hoot! Her overblown sexuality and constantly coming on to everything in pants reminds me some of Samantha on Sex and the CIty and adds some bonus levity when you don't expect it.John Shea is growing on me as Lex- it is hard to see anyone else as Lex though after being treated to Michael Rosenbaum for 6 years.I bought the remaining 3 seasons and look forward to more fun. One thing is certain- I know why Smallville was brought to TV- Warner Brothers was treated shabbily by ABC with limited budgets and resources for this show and they wanted to make sure that the story of Clark Kent was told without the cheese that is the one thing that really mars Lois and Clark. But this was ABC. Can you believe ER also a Warner production was shot starting the year after Lois and Clark premiered?

Lavine ""Highlandlasse""","[268, 274]","Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman The First Season is a FIVE STAR show if I ever saw one.This show has a completely new take on the beginnings of the Characters. It is creative in a way that I believe would make Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster proud. I believe this because I have the distinction of having Parents that not only went to School with both of the creators, but were their friends and were there when Joe and Jerry first came up with the idea of Superman. I have grown up with all sorts of stories of how Superman came to be in the first place. My Father's brother was in Art class with Joe and Jerry and witnessed the very first sketches of the man of steel. Therefore my feelings of this new and innovative creation are very personal.Given this information, I must say that Lois and Clark are absolutely fabulous. The set designs and costuming ring very true to the original as well as adding it's own mark. It is done in a way that will sustain a certain timelessness. The use of the 1940's and the current times combined together are ingenious. This was a very clever way of giving the show a look and feel that will last forever.The stories may not follow the exact history of the original Superman, but nonetheless are so very creative that they make you want to watch every episode because of it's freshness. They are exciting, humorous, and romantic making the show enjoyable to watch. The sexual tension between Lois and Clark not only makes one root for them to get together, but also encourages us to not to miss a single episode.Dean Cain is the perfect Clark Kent/Superman and adds a down to earth quality that everyone can relate to. He is not only very handsome and charming, but extremely talented and adds an innocence to the character that has not been seen before.Teri Hatcher as Lois Lane adds a completely new spin to the character. She is not only talented in her own right, but is classy, sassy, sexy, intelligent and very much her own woman. She adds all these qualities to Lois and still has the ability to show a certain underlined vulnerability at the same time.The qualities in both of these people make them the perfect match. There in lies the magic and success. The secret to any good show is not only the strength of the story telling but the main characters as well. They must be solid not only as individuals but have chemistry between them. Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman has it all.When one adds up all these factors, it gives the show a freshness that doesn't take anything away from the original. On the contrary it adds a uniqueness that makes the show a classic in it's own right that will definitely stand the test of time.In conclusion, I not only recommend you buying this season but suggest that you get the other three for it only gets better each year. My only regret is that the show didn't last longer than four years.Here is the First Season Line Up:1: Pilot - ""Equals Two Episodes""2: Strange Visitor3: Neverending Battle4: I'm Looking Through You5: Requiem for a Superhero6: I've Got A Crush On You7: Smart Kids8: The Green, Green Glow of Home9: Man of Steel Bars10: Pheromone, My Lovely11: Honeymoon in Metropolis12: All Shook Up13: Witness14: Illusions of Grandeur15: The Ides of Metropolis16: The Foundling17: The Rival18: Vatman19: Fly Hard20: Barbarians at the Planet21: The House of Luthor",5,"Superman , Superwoman Equals SUPERSHOW",1119052800,"06 18, 2005",2005,3384,"['Lois', 'Clark', 'New', 'Adventures', 'Superman', 'First', 'Season', 'FIVE', 'STAR', 'show', 'ever', 'saw', 'one.This', 'show', 'completely', 'new', 'take', 'beginnings', 'Characters', 'creative', 'way', 'believe', 'would', 'make', 'Jerry', 'Siegel', 'Joe', 'Shuster', 'proud', 'believe', 'have', 'distinction', 'having', 'Parents', 'not', 'only', 'went', 'School', 'creators', 'were', 'friends', 'were', 'there', 'when', 'Joe', 'Jerry', 'first', 'came', 'up', 'idea', 'Superman', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'sorts', 'stories', 'how', 'Superman', 'came', 'be', 'first', 'place', 'Father', 'brother', 'was', 'Art', 'class', 'Joe', 'Jerry', 'witnessed', 'very', 'first', 'sketches', 'man', 'steel', 'Therefore', 'feelings', 'new', 'innovative', 'creation', 'are', 'very', 'personal.Given', 'information', 'must', 'say', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'are', 'absolutely', 'fabulous', 'set', 'designs', 'costuming', 'ring', 'very', 'true', 'original', 'as', 'well', 'adding', 'own', 'mark', 'done', 'way', 'will', 'sustain', 'certain', 'timelessness', 'use', '1940', 'current', 'times', 'combined', 'together', 'are', 'ingenious', 'was', 'very', 'clever', 'way', 'giving', 'show', 'look', 'feel', 'will', 'last', 'forever.The', 'stories', 'may', 'not', 'follow', 'exact', 'history', 'original', 'Superman', 'nonetheless', 'are', 'so', 'very', 'creative', 'make', 'want', 'watch', 'episode', 'freshness', 'are', 'exciting', 'humorous', 'romantic', 'making', 'show', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'sexual', 'tension', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'root', 'get', 'together', 'also', 'not', 'miss', 'single', 'episode.Dean', 'Cain', 'perfect', 'Clark', 'Kent/Superman', 'down', 'earth', 'quality', 'everyone', 'can', 'relate', 'not', 'only', 'very', 'handsome', 'charming', 'extremely', 'talented', 'innocence', 'character', 'not', 'been', 'seen', 'before.Teri', 'Hatcher', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'completely', 'new', 'spin', 'character', 'not', 'only', 'talented', 'own', 'right', 'classy', 'sassy', 'sexy', 'intelligent', 'very', 'much', 'own', 'woman', 'qualities', 'Lois', 'still', 'ability', 'show', 'certain', 'underlined', 'vulnerability', 'same', 'time.The', 'qualities', 'people', 'make', 'perfect', 'match', 'magic', 'success', 'secret', 'good', 'show', 'not', 'only', 'strength', 'story', 'telling', 'main', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'must', 'be', 'solid', 'not', 'only', 'individuals', 'have', 'chemistry', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'New', 'Adventures', 'Superman', 'all.When', 'one', 'up', 'factors', 'show', 'freshness', ""n't"", 'take', 'anything', 'away', 'original', 'contrary', 'uniqueness', 'show', 'classic', 'own', 'right', 'will', 'definitely', 'stand', 'test', 'time.In', 'conclusion', 'not', 'only', 'recommend', 'buying', 'season', 'suggest', 'get', 'other', 'three', 'only', 'better', 'year', 'My', 'only', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', 'longer', 'four', 'First', 'Season', 'Line', 'Up:1', 'Pilot', 'Equals', 'Two', 'Episodes', '2', 'Strange', 'Visitor3', 'Neverending', 'Battle4', ""'m"", 'Looking', 'You5', 'Requiem', 'Superhero6', ""'ve"", 'Got', 'A', 'Crush', 'You7', 'Smart', 'Kids8', 'Green', 'Green', 'Glow', 'Home9', 'Man', 'Steel', 'Bars10', 'Pheromone', 'My', 'Lovely11', 'Honeymoon', 'Metropolis12', 'Shook', 'Up13', 'Witness14', 'Illusions', 'Grandeur15', 'Ides', 'Metropolis16', 'Foundling17', 'Rival18', 'Vatman19', 'Fly', 'Hard20', 'Barbarians', 'Planet21', 'House', 'Luthor']",Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman: Season 1

I grew up reading the Superman comic books which were pretty good but as I grew older I found the stories were very similar after a while and there wasn't really any ""good"" Lois and Clark stories. When this series aired I anxiously watched it hoping it wouldn't be some half-baked, thrown together series. I was truly awed by it, that ABC got it right! To have Superman as a secondary character and let Clark and Lois (and of course, the supporting cast) be the primary characters. Some of the stories were a little out there but it was great. The producers really understood the mechanics, to place the emphasis on the ongoing relationship of Lois and Clark and also Superman. All of the stories were incredibly done with great detail to the continuity of the characters. Lois Lane, Perry White, Jimmy Olson, Lex Luthor, Clark Kent, Ma and Pa Kent..... all of these wonderful people brought to life in an astounding way be some of the greatest and talented actor's ever seen! John Shea's Lex Luthor is awesome, K. Kalan as Martha Kent is exactly what I have always pictured MA KENT to be like.

Clark Kent (Dean Cain) has moved to Metropolis and gotten a job at the Daily Planet.  He is teamed with investigative reporter Lois Lane (Teri Hatcher) as they investigate stories for the newspaper under the demanding eye of editor Perry White (Lane Smith).  Rounding out the newspaper staff is eager young reporter/photographer Jimmy Olsen (Michael Landes) and society (gossip) columnist Cat Grant (Tracy Scoggin).But Clark Kent has a secret.  He's not a normal human but a man with extraordinary superpowers.  In order to keep that a secret, he takes on the identity of Superman, a fact that comes in handy since many of the stories he a Lois investigate seem to include lots of danger.  There's the sabotage of a space station.  A gang of thieves use invisibility suits to pull off their crimes.  A freak heat wave sends Superman behind bars when he is blamed.  An asteroid hurtling toward earth gives Superman (and Clark) amnesia.  A rival newspaper keeps scooping The Planet.  And the staff of The Planet becomes hostages in their own office.Behind many of the problems is one man, Lex Luther (John Shea).  And while Lois has a crush on Superman (ignoring Clark in the bargain), Lex is pursuing her.  Will she discover how evil he is in time or will she fall in love with the villain?I'm not too familiar with any of the incarnations of Superman, but that hardly matters here.  It builds its own mythology, while keeping many of the things familiar to fans of the comics.  And the emphasis here is on the romance.  In fact, it would be fair to say this is Superman as romantic comedy.  There are several pretty funny episodes in this set, but they are balanced by some of the more serious, episodes that managed to pull at my heart strings.And yes, there is plenty of action.  Some of the special effects do seem dated today, but they hold up for the most part.Everything is tied together well by the acting, including K Callan and Eddie Jones as Martha and Jonathan Kent.  And you can feel the chemistry between Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher.My only complaint with the season is the under use of Lex.  He is often shown and used.  But, unlike today's shows, nothing truly builds until the last couple of episodes.  Instead it feels like every episode they forget what came before so they don't build anything.Still, that frustration is minor.  On the whole, this is a fun show.  It probably doesn't have the mythology completely right.  But it entertains in spades.",4,"""Superman Seems to Have Stuck""",1215302400,"07 6, 2008",2008,2581,"['modern', 'read', 'early', '90', 'take', 'classic', 'American', 'Superhero', 'things', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', ""'d"", 'expect', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'moved', 'Metropolis', 'gotten', 'job', 'Daily', 'Planet', 'teamed', 'investigative', 'reporter', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'Teri', 'Hatcher', 'investigate', 'stories', 'newspaper', 'demanding', 'eye', 'editor', 'Perry', 'White', 'Lane', 'Smith', 'Rounding', 'out', 'newspaper', 'staff', 'eager', 'young', 'reporter/photographer', 'Jimmy', 'Olsen', 'Michael', 'Landes', 'society', 'gossip', 'columnist', 'Cat', 'Grant', 'Tracy', 'Scoggin', '.But', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'secret', 'not', 'normal', 'human', 'man', 'extraordinary', 'superpowers', 'order', 'keep', 'secret', 'identity', 'Superman', 'fact', 'handy', 'many', 'stories', 'Lois', 'investigate', 'seem', 'include', 'lots', 'danger', 'sabotage', 'space', 'station', 'gang', 'thieves', 'use', 'invisibility', 'suits', 'pull', 'off', 'crimes', 'freak', 'heat', 'wave', 'sends', 'Superman', 'bars', 'when', 'blamed', 'asteroid', 'hurtling', 'earth', 'Superman', 'Clark', 'amnesia', 'rival', 'newspaper', 'scooping', 'Planet', 'staff', 'Planet', 'becomes', 'hostages', 'own', 'office.Behind', 'many', 'problems', 'one', 'man', 'Lex', 'Luther', 'John', 'Shea', 'Lois', 'crush', 'Superman', 'ignoring', 'Clark', 'bargain', 'Lex', 'pursuing', 'Will', 'discover', 'how', 'evil', 'time', 'will', 'fall', 'love', 'villain', ""'m"", 'not', 'too', 'familiar', 'incarnations', 'Superman', 'hardly', 'matters', 'here', 'own', 'mythology', 'keeping', 'many', 'things', 'familiar', 'fans', 'comics', 'emphasis', 'here', 'romance', 'fact', 'would', 'be', 'fair', 'say', 'Superman', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'are', 'several', 'pretty', 'funny', 'episodes', 'set', 'are', 'balanced', 'more', 'serious', 'managed', 'pull', 'heart', 'yes', 'plenty', 'action', 'special', 'effects', 'do', 'seem', 'dated', 'today', 'hold', 'up', 'most', 'part.Everything', 'tied', 'together', 'well', 'acting', 'including', 'K', 'Callan', 'Eddie', 'Jones', 'Martha', 'Jonathan', 'Kent', 'can', 'feel', 'chemistry', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'Teri', 'Hatcher.My', 'only', 'complaint', 'season', 'use', 'Lex', 'often', 'shown', 'used', 'today', 'shows', 'nothing', 'truly', 'last', 'couple', 'episodes', 'Instead', 'episode', 'forget', 'what', 'came', 'before', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'build', 'anything.Still', 'frustration', 'minor', 'whole', 'fun', 'show', 'probably', ""n't"", 'have', 'mythology', 'completely', 'right', 'spades']",Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman: Season 1

Alcat ""Curiosity killed the cat, but sa...","[0, 2]","""Louis & Clark: the new adventures of Superman"" is a tv series first aired in 1993, that lasted 4 seasons. That might be a relatively short time, but it was enough to make me a fan. If you are another fan of the series, you will understand what I'm talking about, and why this dvd is a very good purchase. If not, I will try to explain it to you.I will start by telling you about the plot. Of course, this series is about Superman/Clark Kent (played by a very handsome Dean Cain) and his struggle to save the world from Lex Luthor (John Shea), while falling in love with Lois Lane (Teri Hatcher). It is highly likely that you are already bored by this premise, specially considering that you have probably already watched some ""Superman"" movies, and maybe even ""Smallville"" (the new tv series featuring a teen Superman). However, I think that ""Louis & Clark: the new adventures of Superman"" is worth your time, due to the fact that it is:a) different to the movies and ""Smallville"".b) engaging and funny, it starts well with the first season, and gets even better later.All in all, I think that you should give this tv series a try. However, bear in mind that this dvd includes merely the episodes of the first season.

The writers used the tried and true technique of taking the viewer up to the point of Lois and Clark having a relationship and backing off.

Here we have an alien with super powers and super intellect who seems to be confused and lost about events all to often.  In one episode, Lois is convicted of murder and sent to prison.  Clark, alias Superman, seems to be saying to her, ""I'll visit you on visitors day"".  That's the best the Man of Steel can do?  But the good guys prevail and Lois is finally proven innocent.

Now I watch it and cringe. But then, before we had a computer, I used to go into my dad's work to use his computer, and print off loads of photos from the show. In fact, the guys my dad work with, STILL remember me as the little girl I was there, using every website to find new pics? Sad? You betcha.Every since I heard this was coming out on DVD, I've been back to that little girl again, and it's even worse when I watch the episodes. I even remembered the theme tune, even though it has to be one of the most boring TV theme tunes in history. (I'll say Friends or The A-Team is one of the most memorable.) I don't really remember the episodes, I think I may have seen a later series when they were shown on TV. But I very much enjoyed them, although I cringed when I originally saw the guy I used to have a major crush on.I watched all the first series quite quickly, watching two or more episodes or day, til I'd literally overdosed on it. (I think I'm gonna take a break now.) Of course, the effects are very dodgy, the acting is sometimes wooden, and the lines are really, really corny, and some of the storylines are really OTT, but I watched most of it with a big smile on my face.Watching the extras (all two featurettes, lasting no longer than 40 minutes put together), was an eye opener, in how the 10 years, have NOT been kind to the actors. Teri Hatcher has come back from her years in the Hollywood wilderness to a tiny show called Desperate Housewives, and become ultra skinny and gaunt, losing the curves that Superman fans loved about her. My childhood crush *cringe* has bloated around the face, and is showing his age around the eyes. John Shea (Lex Luthor WITH hair) hasn't changed that much, just a few more lines. Tracey Scoggins (Cat) is still as beautiful. Lane Smith doesn't feature in the extras, as he died in June 2005 from Lou Gehrig's disease, and neither does Michael Landes, who is probably still smarting from the fact that he was replaced by another guy, because they thought he looked too much like Dean Cain's little brother. Eddie Jones & K Callan are also well into their old age, and both are nearly unrecognisable.I've read quite a few reviews, where it's said the series does start to go downhill after a wee while, but it will do, the storylines are never up to that much. I've still got the next 2 series on my wishlist, and will buy them right up to the last series. The episodes do get repetitive, and can sometimes be unbelievable, and I doubt this show would last now if it was on TV. The critics would laugh! But it brings back happy memories for me, and a few others out there, who decided to buy it.What HAS Dean Cain been up in the 10 years?

897900,A3FOCW2R5LP3X4,B00080ZG2O,Michael Kent,"[9, 12]","The fans have finally been heard and we have the first season of the ""Superman for the nineties"", ""Lois And Clark - The New Adventures of Superman"". Although long a fan of the show and having seen most episodes many times while the show was on and later in repeats (which unfortunately haven't been on in several years), it's nice to see the first season on DVD.Beginning with the Pilot episode, which plays like a full length film, we see a Clark Kent who is not a bumbling, fumbling loser constantly pushing oversized glasses back in place (a la Christopher Reeve)and who isn't willing to back down from Lois Lane (the exquisite Teri Hatcher)just to please her.We know from the start that a ""partnership"" is developing here, something Clark sees and Lois doesn't (it always seems the man seems to know first...it's the woman who plays hard to get), but we get a genuine appreciation of friendship between the two characters.In the end, Superman is more a supporting player in this show, as it is more about Lois Lane and Clark Kent with Supes just along for the occasional ride.Michael Landes as Jimmy Olsen was a departure from previous depictions of the character and was solid, though not solid enough to be brought back for seaosn two. Perry White as played by the late Lane Smith (""Great shades of Elvis!"")was great as the father figure and mentor to Jimmy and the hard on the outside, soft on the inside editor of the Daily Planet. Probably his most touching scene of the first season was when he decided to go bungee jumping on his fiftieth birthday and Jimmy thought the worst.Lois and Clark had a chemistry and we probably would have seen it develop faster were it not for the incomparable John Shea as Lex Luthor. Sure, it's a different interpretation, Lex with hair and all, and it could be a little over the top sometimes, but Shea brought an ""evil sophistication"" to the role. Unfortunately, he, too, would be gone after season one.The other face not back for season two, Tracey Scoggins as Cat Grant really wasn't much of a loss. Ms Scoggins may be an attractive woman but she served a comedic purpose that had no point and spouted non-sequitors that had nothing to do with the plot itself. I would cringe at the scenes she was in...fortunately she didn't have too much screen time per episode.In the end, though, it was about Lois and Clark and the interplay between the two of them and the suspension of belief that a pair of glasses was all it took to throw the ""best investigative reporter"" off the scent regarding Clark Kent/Superman. Never did it occur to her that they had the exact same voice.Favorite episodes include:The Pilot - Our introduction to the characters and some great effects. Plus we get to see Teri Hatcher in a dress (see, I remember thinking how annoying this Lois Lane was until that scene...strange how perceptions change quickly).Neverending Battle - A test of strength and speed as Lex Luthor sizes up the Man Of Steel.I've Got A Crush On You - So Lois can sing, too? Every male in the joint was looking at her. The scene where Clark dumps Lois in the garbage was priceless.The Green, Green Glow Of Home - Lois feels out of sorts in Clark's hometown and meets Clark's parents.The Man Of Steel Bars - Is Superman and his powers responsible for the city's heatwave? Superman (and Clark) decide to say goodbye.Pheromone, My Lovely - Lois shows her wilder side to Clark, Perry gets a black eye from the husband of the Planet's cleaning lady...but not after a very (very!)bad Elvis impersonation.Honeymoon In Metropolis - Lois And Clark in the honeymoon suite on the trail of a crooked congressman.All Shook Up - Clark and Superman have amnesia after Superman flys into outer space to stop an asteroid from hitting Earth. Watching Ma Kent shove her son off that balcony was priceless.Illusions Of Grandeur - A magician has Superman believing that wrong is right.Foundling - A strange globe is discovered then stolen and sold to Lex. Our first introduction to Jack.Vatman - Lex makes his own Superman, who doesn't exactly play by the rules.Barbarians At The Planet/The House Of Luthor - These final two episodes begin with the downfall of the planet, it's rescue from oblivion by Lex, the destruction of the Planet, Lois agreeing to marry Lex, Clark declaring his love for Lois and Superman trapped in a kryptonite box as Lois walks down the aisle...All of the episodes shine from season one and only whet our appetites for season two...and three...and four (and for those of us who are particularly smitten by the beautiful Miss Hatcher, we'll also put Desperate Housewives, Season One on the list as well...).Season two is on the way in January...the legend continues.",5,"It's A Bird, It's A Plane, It's.....About

897903,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,B00080ZG2O,Mike S.,"[0, 0]","Fair warning this will contain some spoilerish material so be warned....Lois and Clark was the first live action Superman series to be on TV in decades.  It was part soap opera, part romantic comedy and part comic book action series.  The writers paid homage to the comic, but made the series around the relationship (rivals, partners, friends and romantic) between the lead characters.  It was as much (if not more so) a series about the relationship than it was about Superman.Personally I think the first season (as with many television shows) was the best of the series.  It did take a few episodes to get its legs, but once it did, it has the best group of supporting actors, many of the best episodes and the freshest stories of the series.  Teri Hatcher and Dean Cain played the roles as well as anyone could.  They looked the parts and had great chemistry with each other.  Superman's main foil for the season was Lex Luthor, who in this version was portrayed as a billionaire philanthropist who the world saw as good, but was really a super villain.  John Shea played the part brilliantly and the series really lost something when he was no longer a regular.  He and all of the supporting cast really did help anchor the series and made it what it was.  Everyone from Lane Smith as Perry White to Michael Landes as Jimmy Olson added something. The only character that was totally ancillary was the gossip columnist Cat Grant who was only around for the first season.The A/V quality of the DVDs were about as good as you can expect from a show that is now 20 years old.  It was just on the edge of really good special effects, and really bridged the gap effects wise between series like the Flash which was on a few years before this started and Smallville which started a few years after Lois and Clark was off the air.  As far as extras go, there is a 25 min ""making of"" feature and a 6 min feature on the special effects of the series.  There is also the 19min Comic Con presentation of the pilot that was done before the series hit TV.All in all if you were a fan of the show, as cheesy as it could be at times, it is definitely something you want to add to you collection.  If you are really devoted to the comic books, you likely already have an opinion of the show, good or bad.  It was definitely a different take on the story, but a very enjoyable one.",5,Wonderful show,1377907200,"08 31, 2013",2013,2369,"['Fair', 'warning', 'will', 'contain', 'spoilerish', 'material', 'so', 'be', 'warned', '.Lois', 'Clark', 'was', 'first', 'live', 'action', 'Superman', 'series', 'be', 'TV', 'decades', 'was', 'part', 'soap', 'opera', 'part', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'part', 'comic', 'book', 'action', 'series', 'writers', 'paid', 'homage', 'comic', 'made', 'series', 'relationship', 'rivals', 'partners', 'friends', 'romantic', 'lead', 'characters', 'was', 'as', 'much', 'not', 'more', 'so', 'series', 'relationship', 'was', 'Superman.Personally', 'think', 'first', 'season', 'many', 'television', 'shows', 'was', 'best', 'series', 'did', 'take', 'few', 'episodes', 'get', 'legs', 'did', 'best', 'group', 'supporting', 'actors', 'many', 'best', 'episodes', 'freshest', 'stories', 'series', 'Teri', 'Hatcher', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'played', 'roles', 'as', 'well', 'anyone', 'could', 'looked', 'parts', 'had', 'great', 'chemistry', 'other', 'Superman', 'main', 'foil', 'season', 'was', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'who', 'version', 'was', 'portrayed', 'billionaire', 'philanthropist', 'who', 'world', 'saw', 'good', 'was', 'really', 'super', 'villain', 'John', 'Shea', 'played', 'part', 'brilliantly', 'series', 'really', 'lost', 'something', 'when', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'regular', 'supporting', 'cast', 'really', 'did', 'help', 'anchor', 'series', 'made', 'what', 'was', 'Everyone', 'Lane', 'Smith', 'Perry', 'White', 'Michael', 'Landes', 'Jimmy', 'Olson', 'added', 'something', 'only', 'character', 'was', 'totally', 'ancillary', 'was', 'gossip', 'columnist', 'Cat', 'Grant', 'who', 'was', 'only', 'around', 'first', 'season.The', 'A/V', 'quality', 'DVDs', 'were', 'about', 'as', 'good', 'can', 'expect', 'show', 'now', '20', 'years', 'old', 'was', 'just', 'edge', 'really', 'good', 'special', 'effects', 'really', 'bridged', 'gap', 'effects', 'wise', 'series', 'Flash', 'was', 'few', 'years', 'started', 'Smallville', 'started', 'few', 'years', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'was', 'air', 'As', 'far', 'extras', 'go', '25', 'min', 'making', 'feature', '6', 'min', 'feature', 'special', 'effects', 'series', 'also', '19min', 'Comic', 'Con', 'presentation', 'pilot', 'was', 'done', 'series', 'hit', 'TV.All', 'were', 'fan', 'show', 'as', 'cheesy', 'could', 'be', 'times', 'definitely', 'something', 'want', 'add', 'collection', 'are', 'really', 'devoted', 'comic', 'books', 'likely', 'already', 'have', 'opinion', 'show', 'good', 'bad', 'was', 'definitely', 'different', 'take', 'story', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'one']",Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman: Season 1
897904,A27RJ30RN5K9MX,B00080ZG2O,Mitch Weaver,"[6, 6]","Lois & Clark is perhaps one of the best television shows that I have ever seen. I have been a Superman fan for a long time now, and this show brought the classic Superman saga back to life. Everything about this show was done the right way. First of all, the show itself featured a wonderful mix of action, comedy, and romance. This managed to satisfy all different types of people. Some fans would watch the show due to Superman and his powers, while others would watch the show to watch the romance between Clark and Lois play out.Lois & Clark features perhaps the best casting picks I have ever seen. Every actor chosen for the show was perfect for the part that they played. Dean Cain was able to turn both characters off and on very easily. He nailed the geeky and adorable charm of Clark Kent, and the strong hero persona of Superman. Teri Hatcher personified Lois Lane. She not only posessed the beauty of the character, but she also brought the attitude, spunk, and her talent for comedy as well. Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher probably had the best on screen chemistry that I have ever seen, and they really made the relationship between Clark and Lois believeable. Lane Smith was great as Perry White. He brought the tough as nails personality to the character, as well as the funny and light hearted side that would make us all laugh. Lane's obsession with Elvis Presley brought a lot of entertaining moments to the show. K Callan and Eddie Jones were outstanding as The Kents. They also had outstanding chemistry between them, and did a very good job supplying the support and love that Clark needed. My only gripe casting wise was Jimmy Olsen. The first season Jimmy was played by Michael Landes, who I felt nailed the role. However, from seasons 2-4 the show's producers wanted an actor that appealed to more of a younger audience and they went with Justin Whalin. While Justin did a good job, I always felt that Michael did a much better job, and should have remained in the cast.Overall, Lois & Clark is one of the best shows ever made in my opinion. All of the actors involved were unbelieveable, the effects used for Superman's powers were very well done, and the show featured a wonderul mix of action, comedy, and romance that made the show extremely well rounded and enjoyable overall. Ever since Smallville was put on the air, Lois and Clark and Smallville have battled to claim the title of best Superman show. While I highly enjoy Smallville, it will never come close to Lois and Clark in my opinion. If there was ever a show that deserved to be released on DVD, it is Lois and Clark. Frankly I am suprised that season 1 has not already been put out. The show continues to gain fans through reruns in syndication, and even Dean Cain himself has put in a request for the show's release on DVD.",5,One of my all time favorite shows,1080518400,"03 29, 2004",2004,2812,"['Lois', 'Clark', 'perhaps', 'one', 'best', 'television', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'have', 'been', 'Superman', 'fan', 'long', 'time', 'now', 'show', 'brought', 'classic', 'Superman', 'saga', 'back', 'life', 'Everything', 'show', 'was', 'done', 'right', 'way', 'First', 'all', 'show', 'featured', 'wonderful', 'mix', 'action', 'comedy', 'romance', 'managed', 'satisfy', 'different', 'types', 'people', 'fans', 'would', 'watch', 'show', 'due', 'Superman', 'powers', 'others', 'would', 'watch', 'show', 'watch', 'romance', 'Clark', 'Lois', 'play', 'Clark', 'perhaps', 'best', 'casting', 'picks', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'actor', 'chosen', 'show', 'was', 'perfect', 'part', 'played', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'was', 'able', 'turn', 'characters', 'off', 'very', 'easily', 'nailed', 'geeky', 'adorable', 'charm', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'strong', 'hero', 'persona', 'Superman', 'Teri', 'Hatcher', 'personified', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'not', 'only', 'posessed', 'beauty', 'character', 'also', 'brought', 'attitude', 'spunk', 'talent', 'comedy', 'as', 'well', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'Teri', 'Hatcher', 'probably', 'had', 'best', 'screen', 'chemistry', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'really', 'made', 'relationship', 'Clark', 'Lois', 'believeable', 'Lane', 'Smith', 'was', 'great', 'Perry', 'White', 'brought', 'tough', 'nails', 'personality', 'character', 'as', 'well', 'funny', 'light', 'hearted', 'side', 'would', 'make', 'laugh', 'Lane', 'obsession', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'brought', 'lot', 'entertaining', 'moments', 'show', 'K', 'Callan', 'Eddie', 'Jones', 'were', 'outstanding', 'Kents', 'also', 'had', 'outstanding', 'chemistry', 'did', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'supplying', 'support', 'love', 'Clark', 'needed', 'only', 'gripe', 'casting', 'wise', 'was', 'Jimmy', 'Olsen', 'first', 'season', 'Jimmy', 'was', 'played', 'Michael', 'Landes', 'who', 'felt', 'nailed', 'role', 'However', 'seasons', '2-4', 'show', 'producers', 'wanted', 'actor', 'appealed', 'more', 'younger', 'audience', 'went', 'Justin', 'Whalin', 'Justin', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'always', 'felt', 'Michael', 'did', 'much', 'better', 'job', 'should', 'have', 'remained', 'cast.Overall', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'ever', 'made', 'opinion', 'actors', 'involved', 'were', 'unbelieveable', 'effects', 'used', 'Superman', 'powers', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'show', 'featured', 'wonderul', 'mix', 'action', 'comedy', 'romance', 'made', 'show', 'extremely', 'well', 'rounded', 'enjoyable', 'overall', 'Ever', 'Smallville', 'was', 'put', 'air', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'Smallville', 'have', 'battled', 'claim', 'title', 'best', 'Superman', 'show', 'highly', 'enjoy', 'Smallville', 'will', 'never', 'come', 'close', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'opinion', 'was', 'ever', 'show', 'deserved', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'Frankly', 'am', 'suprised', 'season', '1', 'not', 'already', 'been', 'put', 'out', 'show', 'gain', 'fans', 'reruns', 'syndication', 'even', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'put', 'request', 'show', 'release', 'DVD']",Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman: Season 1

At last it is coming to DVD June 7th, 2005. The set will contain 21 episodes over 6 discs, along with extras like pilot episode commentary with Dean Cain, the original pilot presentation, and a retrospective ""From Rivals to Romance"" taking a look at the whirlwind courtship of Lois Lane and that ""hack from Nowheresville. The Lois & Clark Season One DVD set will also include a bonus disc which contains the fourth season premiere of Smallville, ""Crusade.""Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman is my favorite show of all time. The show was on for four seasons from 1993-1997. What made this show so special was the great chemistry Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher had on screen along with a great supporting cast. I was a huge fan watching the first episode in the fall of 1993 (I was 16 years old) and never missed an episode. When the last episode aired in 1997 (I was 20 years old) I was sad because like so many other reviewers I grew up with this show and it was a huge part of my life. I remember every Sunday night I would look so forward to seeing Lois & Clark. Me and my best friend Maria would talk about the show the next day and say how we had so many similarities to these characters. I feel that the fans deserve a DVD release of all four seasons of Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman. This show means so much to so many people because it was a good show that lasted longer than anyone ever imagined it would. What gets me is some tv shows being released on DVD now days didn't even do half as good as Lois & Clark or last more than one season, and yet they seem to get released. I encourage all of the fans to write to Warner Bros. and/or voice your opinion and write your reviews on the show here on amazon. Remember it's the wheel that squeaks that gets the oil. Below is a complete episode list of the first Season of Lois & Clark in hopes that the first season will see a DVD release soon.Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of SupermanSeason 1 Episode List1: ""Pilot""2: ""Strange Visitor""3: ""Neverending Battle""4: ""I'm Looking Through You""5: ""Requiem for a Superhero""6: ""I've Got A Crush On You""7: ""Smart Kids""8: ""The Green, Green Glow of Home""9: ""Man of Steel Bars""10: ""Pheromone, My Lovely""11: ""Honeymoon in Metropolis""12: ""All Shook Up""13: ""Witness""14: ""Illusions of Grandeur""15: ""The Ides of Metropolis""16: ""The Foundling""17: ""The Rival""18: ""Vatman""19: ""Fly Hard""20: ""Barbarians at the Planet""21: ""The House of Luthor""I would just like to mention amazon needs to update the original LOIS & CLARK: New Adventures of Superman link (item # B00005JMN9) because It does not show LOIS & CLARK is available for pre-order and many fans are posting reviews but wondering why amazon has not posted it for pre-order.

The effects aren't the greatest obviously but we have to remember that this was in the mid 90's and cgi effects weren't used a great deal unless it was a sci-fi show like Star Trek or Babylon 5.  The actors did a great job for their individual characters(Dean Cain As Clark Kent/Superman,Teri Hatcher As Lois Lane,Lane Smith As Perry White,Michael Landes As Jimmy Olsen in the first season than Justin Whalin As Jimmy Olsen for the rest of the show,Eddie Jones As Jonathan Kent,K Callan As Martha Kent,and finally John Shea As Lex Luthor.)

897917,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00080ZG2O,Robert Moore,"[5, 8]","There are many great things about TV series coming out on DVD.  First, no commercials.  This has the obvious benefit of keeping unwanted ads from interrupting the narrative, though a secondary benefit is that it has been devastating to older television studies theories concerning television that emphasized the way that shows were integrated into network scheduling, an approach that made commercials integral to the experience of the show and made the show's themselves subservient to its role in the evening's programming as a whole.  Now we can finally appreciate shows entirely on their own.  Second, we get the opportunity to go back and catch up on some shows that for whatever reason we missed the first time around.THE ADVENTURES OF LOIS AND CLARK was a show that I knew many people liked and enjoyed, but while I enjoyed the several episodes that I saw, I did not watch all that much of it at the time.  The great news is that the show is marvelous to watch for the first time twelve years down the road.  The show seems hardly to have aged, thanks in part to the timelessness of the design of the show.  The Superman legend has been used over and over since the earliest days of television.  There was the famous George Reeves version of the show in the early 1950s, a 1980s version of Superboy, this 1990s romantic version, and the currently running SMALLVILLE, which reconceptualizes the Superboy story.  On top of this there are multiple cartoon versions in both film and TV and several films.Although THE ADVENTURES OF LOIS AND CLARK is respectful of previous versions of the Superman legend, its true predecessor is MOONLIGHTING, with Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher filling the slots that Bruce Willis and Cybil Shepherd filled on that show.  The title is not merely a take off on Lewis and Clark, but a statement of purpose in emphasizing Lois as much as Clark in the story.  This truly is about Lois AND Clark, specifically their relationship with one another.  The story of the Man of Steel actually takes a back seat to the romantic comedy in the foreground of the series.  The show works in large part because of the great chemistry between Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher as well as the overall production that keeps their relationship interesting.Although I very much enjoy this series (at least through Season One), I have to note that the romantic relationship prospers at the sake of all else.  There is virtually no dramatic tension in any episode.  There are tremendous potential tensions in Clark's situation as a super empowered individual on the one hand and his need to keep this a secret so as not to endanger others on the other hand.  If one compares THE ADVENTURES OF LOIS AND CLARK to SMALLVILLE, this is all made pretty obvious.  On the latter, Clark's stringent efforts to keep his abilities secret comes close at times to destroying all his relationships.  Over and over his relationships come close to ruin because each of his friends knows that he is dishonest with them.  Precisely what he is hiding from them or lying about they are uncertain, but they all know that he has kept a great deal from them.  When Clark at the beginning of Season Five tells Lana that he wants a relationship with her he begins by telling her that there will be ""No more lies.""  Over five seasons Clark and Lex Luthor's friendship has been severely damaged by the lack of trust and truth telling between the two of them, each of them guilty of lying to the other.  There simply are no similar tensions in LOIS AND CLARK.  In fact, the earlier show is remarkably tension free.  In a way this is not surprising.  If LOIS AND CLARK's main predecessor is MOONLIGHTING, SMALLVILLE's predecessor is the profoundly dramatic BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYERNonetheless, LOIS AND CLARK succeeds well as a romantic comedy.  It is filled with a host of in jokes and gags, most of which work.  My favorite might be at the start of the season, where Clark asks his mother to create a costume for him so that he can fight wrongdoing while keeping his identity secret.  She wonders if he should wear a mask to cover his face, but he explains that all he need do is remove his glasses, and demonstrates by removing them.  As his parents look at him, he apparently becomes unrecognizable to him each time he removes his glasses.  Of course, the ludicrousness of no one being able to recognize Clark as Superman has always been at the heart of the Superman story, but never has anyone made such a nice joke about it.  (On a side note, this is the major problem for SMALLVILLE in any attempt to have Clark create his Superman persona, since even Lois Lane knows him without his glasses.)I should note one other problem with the show, though it is mainly a problem that SMALLVILLE has created for it.  By far the finest thing in that show has been the reconceptualization of Lex Luthor, making him a vastly more interesting and compelling figure than in any other version in the history of the franchise.  LOIS AND CLARK's Lex, on the other hand, is rather cartoonish and uninteresting.  He has been conceived as a sinister industrial magnate, but he is not really allowed to become more than a two-dimensional character.  The rest of the cast is at least OK, though the great stand out is the late Lane Smith, who succumbed this past summer to ALS.On a minor note, fans of movies like THE MUSIC MAN or TV shows like THE GILMORE GIRLS will notice that the show is filmed on one of the most heavily used sets on the Warner Brothers lot.  Any fan of THE GILMORE GIRLS will over time start to recognize bits of the streets of Metropolis as parts of what is now Stars Hollow.  I first caught this on the episode where Clark takes Lois back to Smallville.  I recognized the set and then thought, ""If the camera will just move a bit we could see the gazebo on the town square.""  The camera moved and the gazebo was right where it was supposed to be.  The stock footage for the skyline of Metropolis, however, is clearly that of Chicago.  Interestingly, only night shots are used for Clark's flying scenes over the city.",5,A marvelous recreation of the Superman legend as a romantic comedy,1135123200,"12 21, 2005",2005,6098,"['are',

897918,A1OBPHRXHZF8P6,B00080ZG2O,"Robin Orlowski ""political activist""","[111, 127]","Christopher Reeves was an excellent big screen Superman because he played the classic role, but this primetime 90's series was the first to really focus on a Clark-centric storyline. Even the 'soapy' portions of this series cannot tarnish this all-around excellent product which viewers receive.Dean Cain is an excellent actor who can easily pull a 'brooding' look while also sounding intelligent (duh, Cain actually went to Princeton!). Building on the ""Lois's"" of the past, Teri Hatcher is an independent and assertive career woman (think a female version of Woodward and Bernstein rolled together) who still senses that she is missing something from her 'successful' life---Mr. very right!While she eventually does find out her coworker's secret, she is annoyed by his frequent disappearances and 'strange' behavior during this season.Also unlike before, Clark himself now is supposed to look very hot to the viewers. Gone are the days of the bookish 'nerd' who characterized earlier film, radio, and comic versions of the Kansas farm boy with a very special secret. In those versions, Superman was held up as the ideal, but women were not supposed to lust after Clark. This Clark is both brains and brawn, the latter is shown off very nicely in his spandex-like 'Superman' outfit.Thankfully, that costume appears to be mostly Cain's real body instead of some over pumped Hollywood prop!You can tell that ABC..etc really spent a lot of time, money, and thought putting together this series because the sets look very detailed.We don't have to put up with annoying inconsistencies which have insisted that Ma and Pa Kent are capable of driving from Smallville into Metropolis (which is supposed to be New York City!) in a single day--minus the Superman Express. Even during the all-critical first season (with a different Jimmy instead of Justin Whalin who would have this part during later seasons) the show genuinely draws viewers in.Even if this release does not have any extras, it will be nice to own a series which managed to 'update' the Superman saga without throwing in absurdities. Clark's parents (played by Eddie George and K Callahan) are open-minded people, but they were ultimately small-town country farmers who only want the best for their son.Since rumors suggest that this series finally will be released, do yourself a favor. Skip Smallville and fly towards Lois and Clark.

I fell in love with Lois & Clark right off the bat, mainly because of the pilot. The first season itself is good, but not great, hence four stars rather than five. Still, the first season is the best. I'm glad the pilot is included on the disc, because it was the one episode of the series that I would describe as truly great. It doesn't start on Krypton, or even in Smallville, but with Clark Kent's first day in Metropolis. We get to see him apply for a job at the Daily Planet. We get to see his parents worry about him being discovered every time he saves somebody. We get to see his mom help design the costume and we get to see him go into action for the first time, saving a mega-space shuttle from a bomb and then give it a boost into space. We also get to see his first meetings with Lois Lane, who worships Superman but dumps all over poor Clark, who takes it all with wit and style.For me that pilot was just about perfect, and the guilty pleasure is because this is my favorite Superman movie. The rest of the first season is good, but I wouldn't call it great.A quick comparison: Lois & Clark was the first screen Superman to be set in the &#34;new&#34; DC universe, which was revamped in 1986. The concept was great but the execution was less so. Whereas the comics are rich in characterization and every character recieves time of their own to be fully realized as a person with his own life, L&C; slowly turns into a romance novel with all the supporting characters becoming little more that cardboard background.And then there's Smallville. Smallville, as it must if the series is to be maintained, perverts everything so it all happens when Clark is still a teenager. They changed just about everything from the story I know and love. That said, they also do what L&C; doesn't, which is to take the subject matter seriously. Lois & Clark has the concept right, but the execution was mediocre and got steadily worse. Smallville corrupts the concept, but the execution was nearly flawless. If only L&C; had taken it that seriously they might have also lasted ten years.Still, it's Superman and there's a lot of good stuff there, so I do still like it and watch on a semi-regular basis.",4,Guilty Pleasure,1391644800,"02 6, 2014",2014,2311,"[""'m"", 'Superman', 'fan', 'way', 'back', 'having', 'grown', 'up', 'watching', 'George', 'Reeves', 'series', 'original', 'showing', 'fell', 'love', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'right', 'off', 'bat', 'mainly', 'pilot', 'first', 'season', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'hence', 'four', 'stars', 'rather', 'five', 'Still', 'first', 'season', 'best', ""'m"", 'glad', 'pilot', 'included', 'disc', 'was', 'one', 'episode', 'series', 'would', 'describe', 'truly', 'great', ""n't"", 'start', 'Krypton', 'even', 'Smallville', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'first', 'day', 'Metropolis', 'get', 'see', 'apply', 'job', 'Daily', 'Planet', 'get', 'see', 'parents', 'worry', 'being', 'discovered', 'time', 'somebody', 'get', 'see', 'mom', 'help', 'design', 'costume', 'get', 'see', 'go', 'action', 'first', 'time', 'saving', 'mega-space', 'shuttle', 'bomb', 'then', 'give', 'boost', 'space', 'also', 'get', 'see', 'first', 'meetings', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'who', 'Superman', 'dumps', 'poor', 'Clark', 'who', 'wit', 'style.For', 'pilot', 'was', 'just', 'perfect', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'favorite', 'Superman', 'movie', 'rest', 'first', 'season', 'good', 'would', ""n't"", 'call', 'great.A', 'quick', 'comparison', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'was', 'first', 'screen', 'Superman', 'be', 'set', '34', 'new', '34', 'DC', 'universe', 'was', 'revamped', '1986', 'concept', 'was', 'great', 'execution', 'was', 'less', 'so', 'comics', 'are', 'rich', 'characterization', 'character', 'time', 'own', 'be', 'fully', 'realized', 'person', 'own', 'life', 'L', 'C', 'slowly', 'romance', 'novel', 'supporting', 'characters', 'becoming', 'little', 'more', 'cardboard', 'background.And', 'then', 'Smallville', 'Smallville', 'must', 'series', 'be', 'maintained', 'perverts', 'everything', 'when', 'Clark', 'still', 'teenager', 'changed', 'just', 'everything', 'story', 'know', 'love', 'said', 'also', 'do', 'what', 'L', 'C', ""n't"", 'take', 'subject', 'matter', 'seriously', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'concept', 'right', 'execution', 'was', 'mediocre', 'got', 'steadily', 'worse', 'Smallville', 'concept', 'execution', 'was', 'nearly', 'flawless', 'only', 'L', 'C', 'had', 'taken', 'seriously', 'might', 'have', 'also', 'lasted', 'ten', 'years.Still', 'Superman', 'lot', 'good', 'stuff', 'there', 'do', 'still', 'watch', 'semi-regular', 'basis']",Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman: Season 1
897920,A3FDO58UAHVQD1,B00080ZG2O,Servo,"[12, 12]","Tune in at ground zero for one of television's greatest TV romances with Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman - The Complete First Season! Developed by Deborah Joy Levine (""Dawson's Creek"") and a brilliant staff of series writers including Thania St. John (""Roswell""), Lois & Clark takes the Man of Steel on his most exciting and challenging adventure of all - rivalry & romance (and later marriage) with Lois Lane!Lois & Clark was easily one of my must-see, must-tape-commercial-free shows back during its first-run on ABC. Updated with a 90s sensibility, Lois & Clark brilliantly re-examined Superman through his relationship with Lois Lane, which evolved naturally during the course of the show's 4-year series run. The writing, performances, action and effects were always consistently effective. However, the main reason I faithfully tuned in to the show was for the interplay between Lois & Clark. The idea of Superman struggling thru relationship issues, like any other guy, while still doing the ""superhero thing"" was very appealing. Just look at the Spider-Man films for clear proof. No matter how weak some of the villains may have been regarded, the writers gave them just enough ""menace"" to justify Lois & Clark's investigative attention as the reporters sorted thru their personal stuff while in the process of ""getting the story."" Their chemistry & banter, like that of David Addison & Maddie Hayes in ""Moonlighting"" (another ABC hit and also available on DVD), are what viewers fondly remember most about the show.Teri Hatcher (""Desperate Housewives"") & Dean Cain (""Ripley's Believe It, Or Not!"") star as the unbelievably ""real"" title characters. They not only look great as Lois & Clark, they simply are great. Dean Cain pulls off a decent Superman with easily the best build of his predecessors and an even cooler Clark Kent, who sports great suits and designer eye-frames, making him more appealing to women. Teri Hatcher, who recently won a Golden Globe for Best Actress in Desperate Housewives, clearly should've received an Emmy for her performance in Lois & Clark. Hatcher really BECOMES Lois Lane in this show - encompassing her beauty, intelligence, independence, tenacity and heart with incredible talent. Though, some viewers & critics did initially mock the sound of her voice and her progressive thinness as the show went on. However, Hatcher's beauty and sex appeal were never questioned as TV Guide once proclaimed her as ""The Sexiest Woman in Cyberspace"" (most downloaded), dethroning then-reigning queen Cindy Margolis.I'd be remiss to not mention John Shea (""Mutant X"") as the charasmatic yet deadly Lex Luthor. His exceptional performance rates up there with Murder One's Richard Cross and Alias' Arvin Sloane as standout TV baddie. The rest of the supporting cast are a delight as well including Lane Smith (""V"") as Elvis-lovin' Daily Planet editor-in-chief Perry White; Michael Landes & Tracy Scoggins as photographer Jimmy Olsen & columnist Cat Grant, respectively - both only appearing in this season one set; and of course Eddie Jones & K Callan as Jonathan & Martha Kent. I loved those cute scenes like where they first meet Lois: Martha leads Lois out of the room to freshen up, looks back at Clark and Jonathan and silently mouths to Clark ""I love her!"" to which Clark dismisses her with a playful ""get outta here"" wave. I also liked how the writers addressed common Superman issues such as ""the glasses"" in the pilot where Clark (wearing the final suit) is checking himself in a mirror when Martha, looking on, quips ""Well one thing's for sure, no one's going to be looking at your face."" An embarrassed Clark snaps ""Mom!"" Martha retorts ""Well, they don't call them 'tights' for nothing."" Great stuff.Lois & Clark - The Complete First Season is a 1034 min. 6-disc set, which features all 21 episodes in full frame (1.33:1) picture, and stereo sound. The super extras include: ""From Rivals to Romance"" series retrospective, visual effects featurette, Dean Cain Pilot commentary, original pilot presentation and one bonus DVD containing ""Crusade,"" the season 4 premiere of Smallville, the other popular Superman-related show, which no doubt influenced the release of this Lois & Clark DVD. So don't ""skip Smallville and fly to Lois & Clark"" as another reviewer advised, but instead add it to your Superman collection along with Smallville.

897922,ARIO60NOWL6ZT,B00080ZG2O,Steve Herr,"[6, 6]","The Superman I grew up with was George Reeves in the show that ran from 1952-1957.  Reeves' acting was rather wooden, his Superman was grim and one-dimensional, and with each show being only a half-hour, there wasn't much time for plot development.From there I read the comic books and even though their Superman had more of a personality than Reeves, he was still just this cardboard cutout. I thought the movies were ok, but they were still focused on Superman, rather than the person where he spent most of his time.""Lois and Clark"" is IMO the best Superman yet.  Dean Cain and Terry hatcher had an excellent chemistry, and the focus was on Clark rather than Superman.  One memorable line is when Clark tells Lois, ""Clark is who I am.

I have always been a huge Superman fan and I believe that Chirstopher Reeve was and is Superman. But Dean Cain did do a good job. But...there were two things I didn't like about his Superman.  1: He slicked his hair back which Superman has always done...but there wasn't a single strand resting on his forehead in the shape of an S which is a clasic must for Superman. 2: Dean Cain's eyes are brown...Superman has Blue eyes. Other than those two things his Superman was ok..but not as good as Chirstopher Reeve's...but I did like Dean Cain's version of Clark..I think its nice to give Clark a more modern personality rather than a compelte clutz farmboy. But the reason that Clark was oringaly like that was because that was part of his cover up...no one would think..that even though Clark looked like Superman..that a clutzy nerdy farm boy could possiably be Superman.

897925,AV5G37VFE5NVD,B00080ZG2O,Tom Benton,"[5, 6]","There have been three live-action Superman television series.  Firstly, the classic ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN series, which ran from 1952 to 1958; and lastly, the superhit look at Superman's youth, SMALLVILLE, which began in 2001.  In-between those two shows was LOIS & CLARK: THE NEW ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN.  LOIS & CLARK does an interesting and clever thing (for which we can thank the creator, Deborah Joy LeVine): it takes what was originally a superhero vs. the bad guys story and turns it into a romantic comedy in the vein of MOONLIGHTING.  Some Superman fans liked it, others did not; regardless, the show developed a large fan base from its start in 1993 to its finish in 1997.Here there is more focus on Clark Kent, the man, than on Superman.  Another interesting aspect of the show is that rather than Clark Kent being the mask and Superman being the true person, as portrayed in the SUPERMAN film series, Superman becomes the mask and Clark Kent is the true person.  That said, Dean Cain does an excellent job as the guardian of Metropolis, providing a very interesting and likable take on the Superman character.  Teri Hatcher is wonderfully crazy as Lois Lane, the dedicated reporter in love with Superman; the problem is that she's not in love with Clark ... or is she?  Throughout this first season the relationship between Clark/Superman and Lois is the focus.  Coming in as a side player is John Shea, giving a terrific performance as criminal mastermind/billionaire Lex Luthor, who also happens to be in love with Lois ... and despise Superman.  The supporting cast consists of Lane Smith, who is just fantastic as Daily Reporter editor Perry White (who in this show harbors a strong love of anything Elvis); Michael Landes as Jimmy Olsen; Eddie Jones and K Callan as Clark's loving (and lovable) parents; and Tracy Scoggins as sexy playgirl Catherine ""Cat"" Grant.  This season's guest appearances include Dean Stockwell (in episode ""The Rival""), Larry Linville (""Neverending Battle""), and James Earl Jones (""The House of Luthor"").Along with a fine cast and an interesting concept, LOIS & CLARK also includes some great and often funny writing; a perfectly magical score by Jay Gruska, which includes an absolutely magnificent theme song; and ... well ... some pretty cringe-worthy special effects (they've come along way since 1993).  Some of the season's finest episodes are the ""Pilot"", in which Clark Kent arrives in Metropolis; ""Neverending Battle"" (which features some very funny references to the 50's TV series); ""The Green, Green Glow of Home"", in which Clark discovers Kryptonite; ""The Man of Steel Bars"", where Superman promises not to use his powers after Metropolis' citizens suspect him of causing an immense heat wave; and the two-part season finale, ""Barbarians at the Planet"" and ""The House of Luthor"".  ""Foundling"" also features an interesting guest appearance from David Warner as Clark's biological father, Jor-El.To some fans of the original superhero, LOIS & CLARK is not anything to rave about; but in my opinion, LOIS & CLARK is a grand little series sure to please those who give it a chance.  There's a charming simplicity to it, yet it's far from brainless.  LOIS & CLARK: THE NEW ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN is high-flying fun.TOP 5 EPISODES OF THE SEASON1. Pilot2. The House of Luthor3.

Superman has been so much a part of the American landscape since his creation by Jerry Siegel and Joel Shuster that his comic book visage dominated much of the mid to late 20th century. Superman and other comic book characters are part of our mythology our pulp literature tradition. Deborah Joy Levine had a daunting task; to update Superman for a TV audience without pandering to the camp style that dominated so many comic book TV adaptations. By focusing as much on the relationship between Superman's alter ego Clark Kent and Lois Lane she refocused the characters creating new appeal for a new audience. She obviously hit a nerve because the show was popular from the moment it premiered until it fly off into the sunset four years later.During the first season we meet The Man of Steel for the first time as well as the reporters at The Daily Planet the newspaper where Clark Kent and Lois Lane work. The irrepressible Perry White (the great and underrated character late actor Lane Smith who passed away this month in a fun take on the character) their boss wants action, photos and, most of all, stories that sell newspapers. Superman sells newspapers so when his infatuated star reporter Lois makes it her mission to talk to The Man of Steel it gets done. We also meet Lex Luthor (the marvelously oily John Shea) for the first time as well who will, ultimately, become Superman's nemesis and rival for Lois' affections. Meanwhile ""Cat"" Grant (Tracy Scoggins) has her eyes on Clark for herself. This show is not only a testament to strong writing, direction and performances but great casting. Everyone in the series fit their roles perfectly (even the first season Jimmy Olsen played by Michael Landes although I appear to be in the minority in this opinion) and it's a testament to the fine eye of the casting director Lorna Johnson. Casting a series or movie is a difficult art at best and she's successfully done it for over a decade working on such series as ""Dawson's Creek"" and the cult classic ""Vengeance Unlimited"". So while kudos certainly should go to all that were involved in the production of the first season a special tip of the hat should go to Ms. Johnson. This is really the series where the cast and crew saw their careers take off. (with the exception of vets like Robert Butler who directed key pilot episodes for ""Moonlighting"", ""Star Trek"" and other shows. The pilot and director of it are important for establishing the overall tone and feel for the series)Aside from some minor analog imperfections in the pilot episode, the series looks very good overall. The bright images are crisp and clear for the most part with nice flesh tones and color reproduction. A couple of episodes had their fair share of soft images (particularly, again, the pilot episode). The color is occasionally inconsistent during the visual effects sequences and there's more dirt and debris noticeable in these sequences as well. For a series that's 12 years old and had countless reruns ""Lois & Clark"" actually looks pretty darn good overall. The audio has nice presence with dialog that's crisp and clear. The stereo imaging is nicely used and the soundtrack no distortion that I can detect.There's a 20 minute featurette on the presentation of the pilot episode at the 1993 ComicCon. Producer/writer LeVine discusses the reception of the pilot by the audience and the fears that they all had that it might not live up to their expectations. ""From Rivals to Romance"" focuses on the development of the characters throughout its run. Among those interviewed are Levine, John Shea, pilot director Robert Butler, actress Tracy Scoggins and some of the folks at DC comics. The initial creation and casting of the series is discussed as well particularly the difficulty in finding someone that could carry the series without resorting to the camp clich&eacute;s that have dogged the genre on TV. There's also a brief visual effects featurette that demonstrates how some of the effects were achieved pretty simply whether it be the flying sequences or Superman's super strength. There's no featurette to discuss the casting changes during season two (that'll probably be addressed in the next set) when Michael Landes was replaced as Jimmy Olsen by Justin Whalin during the rest of the series' run on ABC.There's a bonus DVD included with every package as part of Warner's 50th Anniversary of their Television division. This DVD includes the thematically appropriate ""Smallville"" which was developed as a teen version of ""Lois & Clark"" (although the series is inconsistent with ""Lois & Clark""). The episode presented ""Crusade"" is the 4th season premiere. I'm not a huge fan of ""Smallville"" so hadn't seen this episode and have to admit it was done pretty well.Star Dean Cain and writer/producer Levine provide the commentary track along with pilot director/executive consultant Robert Butler on the double length pilot episode. Evidently this is the extra long version of the pilot which runs a bit longer than the final broadcast version. We discover lots of trivia as to why some things were cut, how Dean Cain ultimately ended up with the role and lots of useful insights that apply to the series run as well.""Lois & Clark"" was highlight of the 1993 season. Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher became the title characters during this popular series short run. While the fourth season found the show limping to a less than stellar conclusion, the first two seasons of the show was full of intelligent writing, direction and sharp performances. The third season although it had it's moments was where the series began to lose its footing. Fans of this popular series will be happy this is finally available on DVD and Warner Home Video has done a super job in putting this set together packed with extras. Another studio might have just packaged these episodes without any extras and an indifferent transfer. Warner has done an exceptional job here with the materials at hand. I'm tempted to leap buildings in a single bound (except I'd break a leg or two) I'm so happy with the way this set has been presented. While ""Lois & Clark"" wasn't invincible (the last season didn't have the superpowers of the first two), the show managed to overcome Kryptonite laced scripts in later seasons to remain an enduring reinvention of a classic American icon. Kudos to Warner Home Video and along with the cast/crew for doing such a terrific job in putting this set together!",4,"""Superman"" flies to DVD with great extras",1118880000,"06 16,

Back then I didn't watch alot of shows, instead I watched cartoons. It was only when I grew up and was in high school that I started watching the show on TNT in 2000- 2001. I watched it in the mornings when it was summer vacation. It was a usual morning and I was clicking through the channels and came across it. I watched the episode (I forget which episode it was) and after that episode I fell in love with the series, and watched the rest of the series every morning.The show is well it's just awsome! The storyline and plots were always filled with action, comedy, drama, romance, and tense. I love the series more because of the drama. Any Superman fan would love this series, and even new fans I believe would like it too. I'm glad that WB is putting it on dvd. And like what everyone else has said- I wonder when the rest of the seasons (2-4) would be put on dvd.
