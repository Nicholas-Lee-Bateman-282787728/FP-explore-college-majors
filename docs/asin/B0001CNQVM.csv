Like everyone else, I remember getting up on Saturday mornings and watching the show on CBS. Course, if the truth be known- it was the only channel our TV (at the time) could pick up. Honestly, back then- I watched the show because there was nothing else I could watch. Yet, I've got alot of good memories of those days and, now, I got the chance to relive them all over again with The Complete First and Second Seasons on DVD.Twenty-five episodes were produced during 1969 and 1971 for CBS. Originally titled The Mysteries Five, and later Who's S-S-Scared?- the show, itself, went through alot of changes before it aired. Most notable is Hanna-Barbera not making the gang a musical group.

That aside, this is a lovely collection.The quad-fold digipak is housed in a plastic slipcase bearing an illustration that mimics an animation cell. When the package is removed from the case, it shows the illustration without color against stylized fingerprint background.The inner artwork, like all the Scooby Doo collections I have yet to see, is a bit cheesy in quality compared to the actual animation of the early episodes but for what it is, it is nicely done. The initial fold-out reveals 'Scooby Doo Facts', while another fold-out reveals the four discs themselves, as well as a tag fold detailing their contents. The trays are transparent and when a disc is removed, it reveals a similiarly stylized panel of a panoramic illustrated scene featuring nondescript ghosts and/or goblins in silhouette.As for the quality of the DVDs themselves, I have never seen these episodes look or sound better. In some instances, dialog has been replaced or substituted with alternate dialog, presumably due to deterioration of the original tapes but the difference is hardly objectionable and would only be noticable to a true Scooby Doo connoisseur.While some of these episodes are still sometimes shown on television, others are rarely seen in this day and age and in fact, many episodes contain elements which may be considered socially objectionable.

799933,A3OA1CBIQ275VM,B0001CNQVM,David J. Neal,"[5, 11]","Like oodles of other GenXers now entering middle age, I spent a half-hour or hour of my 1970s Saturday mornings watching the gang roll around in a cool-looking van; run into a mystery involving an inexplicable monster of local legend; do the 3-2 split of Fred, Velma, Danger Prone Daphne and Shaggy and Scooby; have Shag and Scoob looking for food when they weren't running scared; watch Fred and Velma, the two brains in the outfit, solve the mystery and somehow trap and unmask the monster.It was a hunk of my youth and I'll still make jokes about Scooby snacks, Shaggy's apparent munchies, Fred's questionable sexual orientation and loved that the bunch saving the world on Buffy the Vampire Slayer called themselves ""The Scooby Gang."" And watching these episodes does take me back to those Saturday mornings.But doing so after watching the recent ""What's New, Scooby Doo"" episodes on Boomerang (8:30 p.m. Eastern) shows up how weak they really are.And, as another reviewer noted, the extras are bupkiss. For me, great extras are what separates a true DVD from just being ""VHS on disc."" I want background on the creation of the character, certain episodes and how the creators felt about working with what quickly became a pop culture icon. None of that here. In fact, these extras are the worst of any Hanna-Barbera set I have and I'm not necessarily crazy about the extras on any of the other sets.Back to the actual episodes. I bought this set because the Boomerang episodes got my daughter hooked on Scooby Doo and I needed Scooby eps available on demand. As I watched these, I realized that the newer episodes showed up the deficiencies of the original in animation, plotting and dialogue.Stiff animation you could forgive, as the era's technology and television budgets forced Hanna-Barbera into limited animation and they did the best they could with it. But  the plotting was repetitive, the characters two-dimensional and the dialogue stiff with wit that would just get by in a suburban schoolyard (it's almost painful to watch an early Scooby Doo after watching a Yogi Bear, Huck Hound or Quick Draw McGraw cartoon. Maybe because those old Warner writers, Mike Maltese and Warren Foster, didn't do Scoob's adventures).This DVD set is worth the money to me only because it lets me satisfy requests for ""Scooby Doooo!"" from my two-year-old daughter.

Dolnack,"[150, 158]","Hanna-Barbara have put out this box-set of 4 DVDs containing every single complete episode of the ultra-classic ""Scooby-Doo Where Are You?"" that ran from 1969-1970. Don't be fooled that the title states ""The Complete First and Second Seasons""; there only were two seasons.What you WON'T find in this collection (thankfully) are the miriad of spin-offs and bad idea cartoons that were spawned by the original series - such as Scrappy-Doo, Scooby-Dumb, celebrity guest-appearances by Don Knotts, the Harlam Globetrotters and Sonny & Cher.No, this collection is just all the original, pure, superb ""Scooby-Doo Where Are You?"" cartoons that ran from 1969-70. There are a total of 25 episodes spanning four DVDs, with the occasional extra thrown-in. The extras are fluff and as such uneccesary, but there aren't many and they don't detract from the DVDs much.The mastering is done well, and the picture looks crisp, sharp, clean, and bright. The colors are vibrant and true. The sound is also very clean and well done. While they could have probably fit all 25 episodes on fewer disks, I'm glad they chose not to as to keep the compression to a minimum, which they've done.The original ""Scooby-Doo Where Are You?"" series isn't just a silly little cartoon that can be easily modified in any number of ways for marketability [as was obviously thought throughout the 1970s when cartoons went overboard with ridiculous concepts but scaled-back the quality and craftsmanship of great animation].The original Scooby-Doo is nothing short of art. It is highly-realized quality animation that deserves to be preserved in a respectful manner and appreciated by fans everywhere.

When watching this DVD in comparison to &quot;Greatest Mysteries&quot; (which I also own on DVD) the difference in quality is astounding. Even when compared with the reruns on Cartoon Network, it is obvious that these were retouched. The colors are once again vibrant, but yet, not so vibrant that they would detract from the spooky effect of the show.There are 4 discs in the set, and the bonus featuers begin on the second disc. One has all the classics, such as character bios and trivia, but also a special treat on disc 2--a look into the private collections of Scooby collectors. One of the featured colllectors is SCott Innes (the voice of Scooby and Shaggy in the old direct-to-video movies) but for the most part, the people featured are averaga citizens.Does the show still work in the 21st century?

799947,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B0001CNQVM,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[69, 81]","Inspired by such diverse material as radio's &quot;I Love a Mystery&quot; and television's &quot;The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis,&quot; the cartoon series SCOOBY-DOO, WHERE ARE YOU was a smash hit for CBS--and when I was a kid Saturday morning was sure to find me tuned in.  Now that the series has been released to DVD, I can indulge in a fit of childhood nostalgia whenever the mood strikes!In some respects this is a &quot;best possible&quot; DVD release.  With no fewer than four DVDs, it includes all twenty five episodes of the original series--stopping mercifully short of the horrific modification of the original concept into ill-advised spin-offs with tiresome &quot;celebrity&quot; guest stars and down-right awful new characters like Scrappy-Doo and Scooby-Dumm.  The original shows have been cleaned up, and although time has taken a toll (some look washed out and there are quite a few artifacts) short of a digital restoration this is probably as good as it gets.Even so, this pricey set falls down tremendously in the bonuses. I don't normally complain about a lack of extras--after all, you're buying the thing for the meat-and-potatoes show, and bonuses are so much gravy--but when you are shelling out some fairly big bucks for a four DVD set you tend to expect something in the way of added value.  And it just isn't there.  No audio tracks, no &quot;making of&quot; documentary, no interviews.  Instead, the DVDs offer a little trivia game, a look at the collections of three fans, and some &quot;man in the street&quot; type interviews--none of which are particularly worth watching.Given the sometimes ify picture and sound of the episodes, a total lack of interesting extras, and a rather up-town price for the whole thing, I have to drop my rating from five to four stars.  Still, if you remember those Scooby snacks as fondly as I do, you're likely to this package set the easiest (and most cost effective) way of acquiring the original shows.

And he's also been around for 36 years now. Hard to believe huh? Millions (dare I say billions?) of kids have grown-up watching Scooby-Doo and I was one of them. While these episodes from the 1960's and 1970's look and feel dated they are still perfectly acceptable and the overall fun of the show is not lessened.The episodes are as follows.Season 1What a Night for a Knight (1969)A Clue for Scooby Doo (1969)Hassle in the Castle (1969)Mine Your Own Business (1969)Decoy for a Dognapper (1969)What the Hex Going On?

(1969)Go Away Ghost Ship (1969)Spooky Space Kook (1969)Season 2A Night of Fright Is No Delight (1970)That's Snow Ghost (1970)Nowhere to Hyde (1970)Mystery Mask Mix-Up (1970)Scooby's Night with a Frozen Fright (1970)Jeepers, It's the Creeper (1970)Haunted House Hang-Up (1970)A Tiki Scare Is No Fair (1970)Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Werewolf? (1970)Don't Fool with a Phantom (1970)Season 2 is slightly better thanks to the inclusion of one really 70's Danny Janssen song per episode. They are actually quite pleasant, easy-listening songs and it gives the Season 2 episodes a higher nostalgic feel.Of course all 25 episodes adhere to the strict formula the franchise would soon find it increasingly hard to break away from (and end-up resorting to self-parody instead). Each episode will see the gang going about their ordinary lives before getting involved in a monster mystery. The suspects will all be introduced within 5 minutes. The gang will try to trap the monster but Shaggy and Scooby will screw up and fall into the trap instead. Through sheer luck the monster will be caught and unmasked. The criminal motivations will either be revenge, smugglers dressed up to scare away intruders or townsfolks dressed up to attract tourists. It is very hard to come across a Scooby-Doo episode from any season that doesn't flow this way. But, to be honest, towards the end of the second season the writers did try very hard to put a new spin on things and keep it fresh.What I like best about the old school Scooby animation is the rustic feel to the backgrounds and settings. The spookyness is painted on in deep purples and blues and makes for surprisingly atmospheric looking environments. While the slick modern nature of the What's New Scooby-Doo TV show is pleasing to the eye there's just something more and better about the old look.Most of the classic Scooby villains are in here (most of them appearing in Scooby Doo 2) and I strongly suggest that all Scooby-Doo fans buy this box set if they don't have it already. The DVD actually contains some great extras including a cool featurette on Scooby collectors (I must admit I am beaten a zillion times over compared to these guys). Some extras are still fluff tho.The episodes are presented in 1.33:1 full frame, as originally drawn, with Dolby Mono sound. The quality between them is fairly average with age only marring it occasionally.

I was eight when Scooby Doo first aired, and I've been hooked ever since.With the advent of video recording twenty years ago, I started to record episodes as they were played by local television stations.  Unfortunately, the series was never run in its entirity (without mixing in the Scooby Doo Movies and the other spin offs, all of which were terrible).  I also taped commercials and there is the occasional severe weather watch and warning scrolling at the bottom of the screen.  But it was worth recording because I worked nights and there was nothing worth watching on tv when I got home.  Later, separate episodes came out as collections on video, but it was impossible to collect all the shows.With this box set, all past problems are no more.

799960,A22BPC7LRSGSYQ,B0001CNQVM,Joker,"[1, 1]","I've always loved the original Scooby Doo cartoons.  The first season (1969) and the second season (1970) were by far the best Scooby Doo mysteries ever.  Things started to go downhill when they started to include Scooby Dum and Scrappy Doo, etc. in later years.  The first two seasons are the best.  I used to watch Scooby Doo and other cartoons every Saturday morning before going to my junior bowling league.  Then I'd come home in time to watch The Pro Bowlers Tour on ABC at 3:30, then ABC's Wide World Of Sports at 5:00.  Those were the days when TV had good shows and good cartoons, such as Scooby Doo.  The stuff of today is plain sick and lame garbage compared to the shows of yesteryear.These DVDs will entertain longtime fans and newcomers alike.  You can't go wrong with a cartoon that features humor, a mystery to solve and crooks dressed as spooks who try to scare their way to a fortune where the setting is often a haunted house.  I love Halloween, so this show has always been right up my alley.  I think Shaggy and Scooby are at their best in these two seasons as far as humor goes.  Every episode has them clowning around in some way.  I like the ever-shifting trajectory of these episodes.  There's a scary moment, then there's a light and hilarious moment.  It's a good mix of humor and haunts.You get all 25 episodes in this set.  My personal favorites are Spooky Space Kook, Hassle In The Castle, Bedlam In The Big Top, Mine Your Own Business, A Gaggle Of Galloping Ghosts, A Night Of Fright Is No Delight, That's Snow Ghost, and Who's Afraid Of The Big Bad Werewolf?Scooby Doo Where Are You? is an all-time classic cartoon and far better than anything out there today.

In fact, the only thing out-of-style with this show is the clothes (what horrible fashion sense we had back then!!!).For those of you who haven't seen this show, or don't remember it, Scooby Doo was a weekly program about a large, goofy dog (Scooby), and his teenage friends, who go around solving various mysteries - there's usually a ghost or ""monster"" involved, and they almost always find a greedy person behind the mystery.Overall, this is a great show, and one that can be enjoyed by the whole family.

The merchandise, the movies, the constant repeated showings on Boomerang, the video and DVD releases etc. Scooby is certainly deseving of all of this too which leads to the question - why have Warners short-changed him so much on this 'collector's edition' boxed set?The notion of the Hanna Barbera classic shows getting released by season in boxed sets instead of random episodes being stuck on a disc is cause to celebrate (Scooby is joined by the Flintstones, Jetsons and Johnny Quest in this new marketing idea - with many more to follow, I'm sure) but a little more time should have been spent on the execution. The show itself is as brilliant as ever and requires no more said than that - the first 25 episodes transfered nicely to DVD. The problems begin as soon as you want to play the damn thing! The packaging, although nice to look at, is highly impractical with the sleeve being made of a thin (and brittle) plastic that doesn't seem to want to let go of the contents!Once you've managed to remove the discs then you can see how ironic the term 'SPECIAL features' is! The 'animated' menus are the same on every disc with nothing on the main menu to tell you which disc you have got in! Get the Picture and the music video are available on other Scooby DVD releases, The Scooby Doo Challenge is 6 questions of questionable accuracy, Street Smarts is a couple of minutes lazily filled with people saying who their favourite member of the gang is and Funky Fashion is just plain pathetic. The only glimmer of entertainment in these extras is the Ultimate Fan documentary which starts well but after a while ... well, when you've seen one middle-aged man showing you his collection of Scooby Doo dolls and games you've seen 'em all!I don't wish to seem too negative about this title but I only look at it as what it could have been had Warners spent a bit more time and money on the extras particularly considering the hefty price tag attached to this item. Compared to the recent Looney Tunes boxed set this is a very lazy and shoddy offering.

Scooby-Doo, Where Are You? has finally been released in its classic glory, the original classic that started it all.This series still continues to be aired to this day showing the complete fanaticism that fans of this series continue to enjoy to this very day. Like The Flintstones, this is one classic DVD set that most of us have been waiting for and with other classics on the was as well, we're about to be handed the entire Hanna-Barbera library to boot.While there are only 25 episodes in this set, the extra features don't really matter since it's more than worth the money for the episodes themselves and having them on DVD. The set also comes with a free ticket to see the Scooby-Doo 2 movie that premieres next weekend. This is definately the Must-Have DVD set that you have to pick up.It's also the perfect family entertainment package for parents who are too concerned with too much violence on the television set.What even nice about this set is that it wasn't until season two when the animators started adding the songs whenever the gang was being chansed by monsters and ghouls. During the first season, all we heard was classical musical scores. It's a nice family gift and showcases the best in family entertainment.",5,Scooby-Doo: I See You,1079827200,"03 21, 2004",2004,1319,"['Finally', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'classic', 'american', 'animation', 'finally', 'been', 'released', 'Scooby-Doo', 'Where', 'Are', 'finally', 'been', 'released', 'classic', 'glory', 'original', 'classic', 'started', 'all.This', 'series', 'still', 'be', 'aired', 'day', 'showing', 'complete', 'fanaticism', 'fans', 'series', 'continue', 'enjoy', 'very', 'day', 'Flintstones', 'one', 'classic', 'DVD', 'set', 'most', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'other', 'classics', 'was', 'as', 'well', ""'re"", 'be', 'handed', 'entire', 'Hanna-Barbera', 'library', 'boot.While', 'are', 'only', '25', 'episodes', 'set', 'extra', 'features', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'more', 'money', 'episodes', 'having', 'DVD', 'set', 'also', 'free', 'ticket', 'see', 'Scooby-Doo', '2', 'movie', 'next', 'weekend', 'definately', 'Must-Have', 'DVD', 'set', 'have', 'pick', 'up.It', 'also', 'perfect', 'family', 'entertainment', 'package', 'parents', 'who', 'are', 'too', 'concerned', 'too', 'much', 'violence', 'television', 'set.What', 'even', 'nice', 'set', 'was', ""n't"", 'season', 'two', 'when', 'animators', 'started', 'adding', 'songs', 'whenever', 'gang', 'was', 'being', 'chansed', 'monsters', 'ghouls', 'first', 'season', 'heard', 'was', 'classical', 'musical', 'scores', 'nice', 'family', 'gift', 'best', 'family', 'entertainment']","Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!: The Complete First and Second Seasons"

Now of  course like many people I have seen these episodes time and time again on tv through the  years. But there is something about  finally  owning it for yourself that makes it extra  special.As for the shipping I  chose the  super savings shipping option and it only took about  roughly about 5 days including the weekend to receive. So i really  can't  complain on that! :-]I think what I like most is the ability to watch them whenever I want without having to wait  till they come on boomerang to  view. I am almost  done with the first disc and am not  disappointed in the  least.Yes these episodes have a little wear and tear to them, as any  older cartoon show would that  was produced in the  late  1960s, but to me that  makes them even more  vintage looking.Besides this show was  never meant to  be viewed in high definition anyways.There are tons of extras that I am as of yet to get into. I will wait till I have watched all of the actual episodes to  delve more into those.Just being able to see this  show on dvd and owning these first 2 seasons  puts a smile on my face. I honestly  think this was scooby doo at it's best. The stories were well formatted aind  interesting. The  show also knew how to tidy up towards the  end  quite well.These are definitely  epsiodes that can be repeated.Even the ones i thought originally  I wasn't a big fan of ( such as the  dognapper episode.)I remember watching these as a kid and really getting  into them and  I enjoy them even more now as an adult.Shaggy and Scooby are  as funny as  ever. They  play off  really well with  the rest of the gang's straight  forward approach.I also own  the  ""third season"" ,but to be honest it is really  the scooby doo show  with  third season labeled on it. It is enjoyable as  well and  pretty much picks up  where the original series left off.Though  you really can't beat these original episodes. I think i will have even more  enjoyable times with  these in the future.This is a MUST HAVE for  serious scooby fans that is  for  sure.",5,Scooby At It's Best!!! :-],1324512000,"12 22, 2011",2011,2127,"['Okay', 'just', 'got', 'few', 'days', 'ago', 'am', 'slowly', 'working', 'way', 'episodes', 'Now', 'course', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'seen', 'episodes', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'tv', 'years', 'something', 'finally', 'owning', 'extra', 'special.As', 'shipping', 'chose', 'super', 'savings', 'shipping', 'option', 'only', 'took', 'about', 'roughly', '5', 'days', 'including', 'weekend', 'receive', 'i', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'complain', ']', 'think', 'what', 'like', 'most', 'ability', 'watch', 'whenever', 'want', 'having', 'wait', 'till', 'come', 'boomerang', 'view', 'am', 'almost', 'done', 'first', 'disc', 'am', 'not', 'disappointed', 'least.Yes', 'episodes', 'have', 'little', 'wear', 'tear', 'older', 'cartoon', 'show', 'would', 'was', 'produced', 'late', '1960s', 'even', 'more', 'vintage', 'show', 'was', 'never', 'meant', 'be', 'viewed', 'high', 'definition', 'are', 'tons', 'extras', 'am', 'yet', 'get', 'will', 'wait', 'till', 'have', 'watched', 'actual', 'episodes', 'delve', 'more', 'those.Just', 'being', 'able', 'see', 'show', 'dvd', 'owning', 'first', '2', 'seasons', 'smile', 'face', 'honestly', 'think', 'was', 'scooby', 'doo', 'best', 'stories', 'were', 'well', 'formatted', 'interesting', 'show', 'also', 'knew', 'how', 'tidy', 'up', 'towards', 'end', 'quite', 'well.These', 'are', 'definitely', 'can', 'be', 'repeated.Even', 'ones', 'i', 'thought', 'originally', 'was', ""n't"", 'big', 'fan', 'such', 'dognapper', 'episode', 'remember', 'watching', 'kid', 'really', 'getting', 'enjoy', 'even', 'more', 'now', 'adult.Shaggy', 'Scooby', 'are', 'as', 'funny', 'ever', 'play', 'off', 'really', 'well', 'rest', 'gang', 'straight', 'forward', 'approach.I', 'also', 'own', 'third', 'season', 'be', 'honest', 'really', 'scooby', 'doo', 'show', 'third', 'season', 'labeled', 'enjoyable', 'as', 'well', 'pretty', 'much', 'up', 'where', 'original', 'series', 'left', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'beat', 'original', 'episodes', 'think', 'i', 'will', 'have', 'even', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'times', 'future.This', 'MUST', 'HAVE', 'serious', 'scooby', 'fans', 'sure']","Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!: The Complete First and Second Seasons"

Unfortunately, most of the Scooby you find on TV is the newer movies and versions of the show which, in my opinion, aren't nearly as good as the original episodes I saw as reruns on TV when I was a kid. I was so thrilled to find this collection of those original episodes on Amazon (at a good price, too)! My son loves to watch these and I'll admit that I even like watching them with him; I guess you never outgrow Scooby-Doo! If you've never seen these episodes I highly recommend giving them a try. If you are worried about letting your child watch cartoons because they can be goofy/obnoxious, this is the Scooby you want: there is no ""Scrappy-Doo"" in these (thankfully).The only issue I've had with this DVD set is that, at least in my DVD player, if you select ""play all"" it doesn't actually play all the episodes on a disc.

799982,A2LXPWXVJKA64R,B0001CNQVM,"Mr Groovy 70s ""Classic old-school guy""","[4, 5]","HALLELUJAH! SCOOBY, in its original 1969 form, STILL LIVES!!! Here, there's NO guest stars with sloppy animation, NO Scooby cousins, NO Dynomutt, NO Laffolympics, and definitely NO Scrappy-Doo (that little runt deserves to be muzzled, since he's always giving Scooby and Shaggy a hard time!) and NO live-action movies (which were nothing but total no-brainers!).Okay, I admit it: I guess I'm what you would call one of those *purist* Scooby fans, but what else can I (and others who agree with me) say?  The 1969 classic NEVER came without a hitch: the style of animation was pretty flawless, if not top notch; and it's always fun to watch how the gang gets serious and down-to-to-earth while being wacky and cornball all at the same time. In short, since this was a real crowd-pleaser, the H-B guys really knew how to keep it consistent on both levels.  This is a rarity you see missing from most of today's cartoons/kids' shows.Having had my say about how *great* a cartoon classic the 1969 series was, I do have a major beef about the DVD here:  since Scooby made its debut 35 years ago, it's become a pop culture phenomenom (which isn't bad, don't get me wrong); it's just that the bonus features here don't do this DVD not one bit of justice, which happens to be bogus.  I mean, there's no behind-the scenes info, no audio commentaries, no interviews with the original voice cast, absolutely NOTHING to make the Scooby legacy more meaningful to both Scooby and non-Scooby fans alike, let alone to cartoon and non-cartoon fans.  Instead, we see one feature showing fans' collections of Scooby memorabilia. (One of those fans is the new voice of Scooby and Shaggy, in which he can't even do a dead-on impersonation of neither one of them; he sounds more obnoxious than amusing.) We also get to see other pointless features, such as fans recalling their fave eps., and a ""how to"" draw the Scooby gang.Why couldn't they have done something like a Scooby's ""video jukebox"" of chase songs or a ""pop-up video"" in which there's captions showing up detailing the background or humor of the gang, or with its pop culture references of the time?  For example, how many people know when Velma goes ""Verrry intereshting!"" in one episode, that she's playfully quoting Arte Johnson's German soldier from the late 60s/early 70s TV variety show ""Laugh-In""?  Or about Casey Kasem(original voice of Shaggy), what drew him (pardon the expression) to cartoon voiceover work? Was it because of the catchy chase songs in this and ""Josie and the Pussycats"" (in which he also played Alexander), since he also happens to be a famous radio disc jockey?Okay, I'm sorry, I don't mean to be spilling secrets here that haven't been disclosed, but the bottom line here is that the DVD bonuses here could do a MUCH better job to the Scooby legacy.Also, one last complaint, Hanna-Barbera/Warner Bros.: you have almost every H-B cartoon of the 60s (whether it's this, Flintstones, or Yogi Bear) out on DVD. Just when are we going to get to see the Banana Splits soon (and not just on Boomerang in the wee hours of the morning)?  Even if this has nothing to do with Scooby (though they aired neck-to neck between 1968-70 or 1969-71), at least they are a vital part of the H-B legacy.There. I've said it.  All in all, Scooby IS one of the BEST classic cartoons around along with other Hanna-Babera faves (Flintstones, Josie and the Pussycats, or Jabberjaw) and non-HB faves (Looney Tunes, Schoolhouse Rock, and Fat Albert).

799989,A1M9DQDGE07Q0U,B0001CNQVM,Nix Pix,"[15, 19]","The 1970's were a particularly lucrative time for William Hanna And Joseph Barbara; two animators responsible for creating the highly successful ""Tom & Jerry"" short subjects at MGM during the late forties and early fifties. Following the demise of short subjects, Hanna & Barbara launched into television with ""The Flintstones"" - a thinly disguised parody of ""The Honeymooners."" The series - the first prime time cartoon programming in the history of television, was an instant and resounding success. The team followed this rich endevor with ""The Jetsons"" - an equally ambitious cartoon family drama/comedy that unfortunately failed to scale the heights of their previous series. But with ""Scooby Doo"" Hanna & Barbara easily hit pay dirt and, if for no other reason, cemented their place in animated history. The series of comedy/mysteries centers around a troupe of ""meddling"" teens and their canine catastrophy - Scooby Doo who are constantly finding themselves in the middle of some haunted happenings that are all too easily explained in the end.THE TRANSFER: Warner Brothers gives us seasons one and two (25 episodes) of this trend-setting pop culture phenomenon. But the transfers are riddled with analog artifacts and some obtrusive cell elements that crop up in nearly ever shot. Though dirt and age related artifacts are kept at a minimal, some episodes appear to have faired far better than others. Over all, colors are rich, though flat and very one dimensional looking at times. Okay, so it's not Disney animation. The point is there seems to be a ""pasty"" look to some of the episodes that is absent in others. Contrast and black levels are well balanced but certain scenes, particularly during the opening title sequence, are very dark and require a dark room to be completely enjoyed. The audio is mono but nicely balanced.EXTRAS: Some really boring stuff including a gaudy music video, a fan's fav episode featurette which is really a retreading of material included elsewhere, and a disengaging making of featurette that in no way is as comprehensive as Warner's Looney Toons box set.BOTTOM LINE: Yes, this is one for your library if you are a die hard Scooby fan. But the extras read more like a pile of Scooby snacks.",3,"HAUNTED YUK, YUKS and SPOOKY GOOD TIMES!

800006,A3FDO58UAHVQD1,B0001CNQVM,Servo,"[527, 543]","My earliest and most fondest memory of watching the classic 1969 Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! was in the 70s early on Saturday morning when it was still dark outside. Considering how Scooby is often parodied today, this may surprise you but back then (to my young eyes) Scooby-Doo was kinda scary and creepy thanks to the creepy background settings, the monsters (my favorite: the skeleton-headed spaceman with the crazy laugh) and Ted Nichols' creepy underscore which could build up tension like Bernard Herrmann did for Hitchcock. Luckily, the tension would be broken with Scooby and Shaggy's comedic antics. Antics which typically resulted in the ""musical chase numbers"" which would conclude with the ""monster"" getting trapped, then unmasked, followed by the villain's obligatory ""And I would've gotten away with it too, if it hadn't been for those meddling kids""...[and their dog]. As predictable, or even corny as others deem it be, all of this - the pure 60s/70s fun - is what has eternally endeared Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! to me above all the other versions. Produced and directed by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, Scooby-Doo's mystery-solving format remains one of most often imitated shows to date. Fangface, Clue Club, Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels, Rickety Rocket, Jabberjaw (just to name a few) all owe credit to Scooby-Doo. After the two seasons here in this collection the quality of the show was diminished to rather ""cartoony proportions."" Though, some versions were still interesting to watch such as 1972's The New Scooby-Doo Movies where the gang would team up with guest stars such as Batman & Robin, The Addams Family, Jerry Reed, Tim Conway, Sandy Duncan, and such. There were three versions of Scooby-Doo's opening theme for the two seasons in this collection: One is a rare instrumental only version used in the first few episodes of season one; the other is the classic vocal version performed by studio singer Larry Marks used for the remainder of season one; and then there's the one that has the same music and lyrics as the classic version but was performed by ""chase songs"" artist Austin Roberts for season two. For the grooviest adventures of Freddy, Daphne, Velma, Shaggy, and Scoob, this DVD collection is definitely the best buy!Features:FeaturettesMusic videosDVD challengeEpisodes:What a Night for a Knight (1969)A Clue for Scooby Doo (1969)Hassle in the Castle (1969)Mine Your Own Business (1969)Decoy for a Dognapper (1969)What the Hex Going On?

I remember being so excited when each of the networks would premiere their new Satuday lineups usually on the Friday evening before all the new shows started.

800011,A176IA89VGH46M,B0001CNQVM,Todd Bovair,"[6, 7]","Notice I included 'television' in the title because Looney Tunes are the greatest cartoons EVER, but they were created for movie theaters (and they were NOT intended as entertainment for kids). The greatest television cartoon of all time for ME is Dungeons & Dragons, because it had great continuity storylines and slightly more mature themes than Scooby Doo. D&D; is not available on DVD yet, but when it is finally released, you might want to check it out. Now, on to Scooby.First and foremost, the biggest complaint I have seen from people is the artwork/animation quality. Scooby utilized cheap animation, with a minimum of frames per second and camera zooms/tricks to keep animation costs down. Hanna-Barbara was known for its pathetically cheap animation, and Scooby Doo is no different from other Hanna-Barbara shows in that respect. The animation does not detract from the show, however, because it is part of the charm of Scooby. It is a simple cartoon, art & storywise, from a simpler time. It should be noted that Japanese anime shows which came later (like Voltron & Pokemon)have MUCH worse animation, since they take the 'lack of animated movement and camera tricks to save money' technique to a RIDICULOUS degree. In comparison, Scooby doesn't look all that bad.The second complaint I have seen from people about Scooby is the simple, repetitive storylines. Well, there are two things that need to be kept in mind here. These cartoons were created for young kids, of course they are going to be simple and 'cartoony'. Second, these were created before DVD's or even VCR's, they were never meant to be watched altogether. The creators knew that kids would catch an episode of Scooby a maximum of once a week (Saturday morning), and probably wouldn't be able to watch cartoons EVERY Saturday. So they created stand alone episodes with no continuing storylines, so you could watch ANY episode of Scooby and immediately be able to follow the story and the characters. In addition, the show formula worked, so why change the simple plot? They simply changed the monster Mystery Inc faced every week, and it worked beautifully.One interesting thing to note is that Scooby Doo didn't have a real 'first' episode. There was no real introduction to the characters or the circumstances of the show, it just jumps right in, just like every episode of Scooby Doo.Another note of interest is Casey Kasem. While it is common knowledge that Kasem voices Shaggy, you may not realize just how many other voices he does. Listen to the local sheriff, or the old farmer, or the security guard, etc. Kasem voices A LOT of these bit character types that appear in every Scooby episode. This is done of course to keep costs down by minimizing the number of actors required to voice an episode (a common practice in cartoon production).Unfortunately for Scooby, the creators didn't know a good thing when they had it. They kept tinkering with the formula (why fix it when it isn't broken?!) by teaming up Scooby with other cartoons for a ""power hour"" type of show (Dynomutt, Laff-O-Lympics), and creating new inferior characters like Scooby Dum and (shudder) SCRAPPY DOO. The creators also ditched Fred and Velma for a while, prefering Shag and Scoob with just Daphne. NOT a brilliant move.This DVD set represents the TRUE Scooby Doo cartoons, before any tinkering began. These are the only original episodes featuring the classic Mytery Inc lineup and only them. All future DVD releases (like the Scooby Doo movies and the Scooby/Dynomutt Hour) feature tinkered with, inferior product.Scooby Doo is a CLASSIC cartoon, for the likeable characters, the great simple concept, the scary (for little kids) monsters, great music (who DOESN'T remember at least one of the 5 or 6 musical themes used in the scenes?)and the comedy hijinx. If you grew up with Scooby like I did, you simply must watch this DVD set. It will bring back A LOT of fond memories.",5,The second best TELEVISION cartoon series ever!,1136764800,"01 9, 2006",2006,3938,"['Notice', 'included', ""'television"", 'title', 'Looney', 'Tunes', 'are', 'greatest', 'cartoons', 'EVER', 'were', 'created', 'movie', 'theaters', 'were', 'NOT', 'intended', 'entertainment', 'kids', 'greatest', 'television', 'cartoon', 'time', 'ME', 'Dungeons', 'Dragons', 'had', 'great', 'continuity', 'storylines', 'slightly', 'more', 'mature', 'themes', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'D', 'D', 'not', 'available', 'DVD', 'yet', 'when', 'finally', 'released', 'might', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'Now', 'Scooby.First', 'foremost', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'have', 'seen', 'people', 'artwork/animation', 'quality', 'Scooby', 'utilized', 'cheap', 'animation', 'minimum', 'frames', 'second', 'camera', 'zooms/tricks', 'keep', 'animation', 'costs', 'down', 'Hanna-Barbara', 'was', 'known', 'pathetically', 'cheap', 'animation', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'different', 'other', 'Hanna-Barbara', 'shows', 'respect', 'animation', 'not', 'detract', 'show', 'however', 'part', 'charm', 'Scooby', 'simple', 'cartoon', 'art', 'storywise', 'simpler', 'time', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'Japanese', 'anime', 'shows', 'came', 'later', 'Voltron', 'Pokemon', 'have', 'MUCH', 'worse', 'animation', 'take', ""'lack"", 'animated', 'movement', 'camera', 'tricks', 'save', 'money', 'technique', 'RIDICULOUS', 'degree', 'comparison', 'Scooby', ""n't"", 'look', 'bad.The', 'second', 'complaint', 'have', 'seen', 'people', 'Scooby', 'simple', 'repetitive', 'storylines', 'Well', 'are', 'two', 'things', 'need', 'be', 'kept', 'mind', 'here', 'cartoons', 'were', 'created', 'young', 'kids', 'course', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'simple', 'Second', 'were', 'created', 'DVD', 'even', 'VCR', 'were', 'never', 'meant', 'be', 'watched', 'altogether', 'creators', 'knew', 'kids', 'would', 'catch', 'episode', 'Scooby', 'maximum', 'once', 'week', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'cartoons', 'EVERY', 'Saturday', 'created', 'stand', 'alone', 'episodes', 'continuing', 'storylines', 'could', 'watch', 'ANY', 'episode', 'Scooby', 'immediately', 'be', 'able', 'follow', 'story', 'characters', 'addition', 'show', 'formula', 'worked', 'so', 'why', 'change', 'simple', 'plot', 'simply', 'changed', 'monster', 'Mystery', 'Inc', 'faced', 'week', 'worked', 'beautifully.One', 'interesting', 'thing', 'note', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'real', 'episode', 'was', 'real', 'introduction', 'characters', 'circumstances', 'show', 'just', 'jumps', 'right', 'just', 'episode', 'Scooby', 'Doo.Another', 'note', 'interest', 'Casey', 'Kasem', 'common', 'knowledge', 'Kasem', 'voices', 'Shaggy', 'may', 'not', 'realize', 'just', 'how', 'many', 'other', 'voices', 'Listen', 'local', 'sheriff', 'old', 'farmer', 'security', 'guard', 'etc', 'Kasem', 'A', 'LOT', 'bit', 'character', 'types', 'appear', 'Scooby', 'episode', 'done', 'course', 'keep', 'costs', 'down', 'minimizing', 'number', 'actors', 'required', 'voice', 'episode', 'common', 'practice', 'cartoon', 'production', '.Unfortunately', 'Scooby', 'creators', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'good', 'thing', 'when', 'had', 'kept', 'tinkering', 'formula', 'why', 'fix', 'when', ""n't"", 'broken', 'teaming', 'up', 'Scooby', 'other', 'cartoons', 'power', 'hour', 'type', 'show', 'Dynomutt', 'Laff-O-Lympics', 'creating', 'new', 'inferior', 'characters', 'Scooby', 'Dum', 'shudder', 'SCRAPPY', 'DOO', 'creators', 'also', 'ditched', 'Fred', 'Velma', 'while', 'prefering', 'Shag', 'Scoob', 'just', 'Daphne', 'NOT', 'brilliant', 'move.This', 'DVD', 'set', 'TRUE', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'cartoons', 'tinkering', 'began', 'are', 'only', 'original', 'episodes', 'featuring', 'classic', 'Mytery', 'Inc', 'lineup', 'only', 'future', 'DVD', 'releases', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'movies', 'Scooby/Dynomutt', 'Hour', 'feature', 'tinkered', 'inferior', 'product.Scooby', 'Doo', 'CLASSIC', 'cartoon', 'likeable', 'characters', 'great', 'simple', 'concept', 'scary', 'little', 'kids', 'monsters', 'great', 'music', 'who', 'DOES', ""N'T"", 'remember', 'least', 'one', '5', '6', 'musical', 'themes', 'used', 'scenes', 'comedy', 'hijinx', 'grew', 'up', 'Scooby', 'did', 'simply', 'must', 'watch', 'DVD', 'set', 'will', 'bring', 'back', 'LOT', 'fond', 'memories']","Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!: The Complete First and Second Seasons"

I've only watched one episode so far, but the picture and sound quality is excellent. I checked out some of the special features, and they're very cool. I just wish they could've come out with this DVD much sooner than it did. Oh well. They did do a good job making them, so I guess it was worth the wait. So, if you're a fan of Scooby Doo, or if you want to be able to watch a television show from the late 60s and early 70s, then I really suggest that you grab a burger and some fries and buy this DVD.

You'll find NO Scooby-Dum, NO Scrappy-Doo...NO crappy celebrities. This DVD collection should have been called ""Scooby-Doo Where Are You! The Complete Series"" because after these ran on CBS Scooby and the gang spun-off into ""The New Scooby-Doo Movies"" in 1972 and the many other equally bad series that followed. In this collection you get all 25 original ""Where Are You"" episodes. The bonus features are a complete waste of time...it would have been nice to have interviews with Frank Welker and Casey Kasem and maybe a gallery of sketches and storyboards. The bonuses are more to entertain the children viewing these DVDs (but isn't that what the show is for?). It's because of the bad bonus features that I'm giving this collection only 4 stars. The bonuses on The Flintstones were much better. All in all, it's a great collection and I recommend it. It's like a trip back into time...when you couldn't seem to wake up for school everyday...but you were wide awake every Saturday morning to see what tricks Bill Hanna and Joe Barbera had up their sleeves.
