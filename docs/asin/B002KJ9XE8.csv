1274919,A288MD5LTH859O,B002KJ9XE8,Amazon Customer,"[2, 2]","I like the wii program.  The problem is the equipment.  First, if you are any bigger than the lady on the box for the legl band or in the video that you can watch on Amazon, don't bother. You MUST fit the leg band above your thigh.  I bought this Wii fit compatible because I am in the process of losing weight.  Hello, My thigh is WAY too large for it.  So pay attention to any specifications.  It's NOT for people who are exercising for weight loss and have more than 40 lbs to lose.  Also, the avatar is constantly getting stuck because it isn't reading my movements, which is really frustrating, and I'm sure it's because the leg band was only above my knee.  Finally, the exercise band that came with the leg band is nowhere near stretchy enough.  I'm just 5'3"", I had the band completely stretched out between my feet so as to leave the most stretch in the vertical sections. Even with that, I could barely raise my hands as high as my hips on the bicep curls. And, of course, the avatar kept getting stuck because I wasn't lifting my hands high enough.  I didn't really need this band--I just wanted the leg thing, so I'm going to use my own exercise band next time.With all of that, if I can get it working better (I'm going to sew velcro onto the leg band to extend it until I lose more weight), it would be a really good workout.  It's fun because it mixes things up alot.  I'd rather play more exercise games than do all the strength training, but that's not a big issue.  It could be better though.",3,"Okay, but not great",1350432000,"10 17, 2012",2012,1510,"['like', 'wii', 'program', 'problem', 'equipment', 'First', 'are', 'bigger', 'lady', 'box', 'legl', 'band', 'video', 'can', 'watch', 'Amazon', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'MUST', 'fit', 'leg', 'band', 'thigh', 'bought', 'Wii', 'fit', 'compatible', 'am', 'process', 'losing', 'weight', 'Hello', 'My', 'thigh', 'WAY', 'too', 'large', 'So', 'pay', 'attention', 'specifications', 'NOT', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'exercising', 'weight', 'loss', 'have', 'more', '40', 'lbs', 'lose', 'Also', 'avatar', 'constantly', 'getting', 'stuck', ""n't"", 'reading', 'movements', 'really', 'frustrating', ""'m"", 'sure', 'leg', 'band', 'was', 'only', 'knee', 'Finally', 'exercise', 'band', 'came', 'leg', 'band', 'nowhere', 'near', 'stretchy', 'enough', ""'m"", 'just', '5', '3', 'had', 'band', 'completely', 'stretched', 'out', 'feet', 'so', 'leave', 'most', 'stretch', 'vertical', 'sections', 'Even', 'could', 'barely', 'raise', 'hands', 'as', 'high', 'hips', 'bicep', 'curls', 'course', 'avatar', 'kept', 'getting', 'stuck', 'was', ""n't"", 'lifting', 'hands', 'high', 'enough', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'need', 'band', 'just', 'wanted', 'leg', 'thing', ""'m"", 'going', 'use', 'own', 'exercise', 'band', 'time.With', 'can', 'get', 'working', 'better', ""'m"", 'going', 'sew', 'velcro', 'leg', 'band', 'extend', 'lose', 'more', 'weight', 'would', 'be', 'really', 'good', 'workout', 'fun', 'mixes', 'things', 'up', 'alot', ""'d"", 'rather', 'play', 'more', 'exercise', 'games', 'do', 'strength', 'training', 'not', 'big', 'issue', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'though']",N/A
1274920,A17V9XL4CWTQ6G,B002KJ9XE8,Chandler,"[31, 32]","First, let me say I wear a bodybugg to measure my daily caloric burn. Because I do, I am also able to measure the exact calorie burn of every fitness dvd or wii game I do not only during the total workout time, but also via calories burned per minute...with rigid accuracy. I mention this only so you know what I say about calorie burn is based upon scientific measurement rather than simply perceived exertion or what the game states I burn for the ""average"" person.In comparison to my other wii fitness games (and I have quite the collection!) this one hit the bullseye! I burned more calories playing this version than even the original and that one offered great caloric burn as well. (I often burned far more than the game thought I would in their own average measurement and it far outshone the caloric burn of both versions of the wii fit) Incidentally, my own measured calorie burn was just slightly more than what was read on the screen so it's quite an accurate measurement as most games far overestimate calorie burn but this one was pretty close to being right on the money when compared to my bodybugg readout. (I actually burned 25 calories more than what it told me I burned.)but, more importantly, this time the focus was on FUN! If you watch the ""Biggest Loser"" you know that sometimes we push ourselves harder when there is a competitive aspect to our working out, and EA's ""More Workouts"" took this into consideration. You sometimes race others and for me personally...that pushes me...but not nearly as much as a workout that takes the ""work"" out of it as much as possible. The new scenery and the fun ""games"" aspect of losing weight (reminding me again of the challenges on ""The Biggest Loser"") made me not watch the clock but, instead, get into the GAME of losing weight which is, after all, the whole beauty of using the wii rather than a fitness dvd.  I had fun and forgot it was WORK!Additionally, using the fitness band enables me to work out muscles that I don't normally reach within other workouts. This also adds interest for me as it's something different than my usual workout routine. Should you advance in the game, just buy a stronger band so you keep working your muscles harder and, consequently, increasing your metabolism via muscle generation.The game takes into account that the most effective workouts burn high calories during the workout, but add strength training so that you continue to burn more calories even at rest long after the game. And this is one of the benefits of the EA Sports games...my bodybugg showed increased caloric burn due to the strength training long after I stopped the game.  And while I love my wii fit for balance, it's true calorie burn is low, and while I love many of my other wii fitness games for high calorie burn, they often don't offer strength training to keep up the burn. So this is important for me.The concentration here is on having fun while you lose weight. And it fulfills it's goal.Tip: Don't forget the game is often reading your wiimote hand controls even during leg exercises to ensure your body is in correct alignment; don't put down the hand controls when you are instructed to use them and always hold them as shown for best accuracy. Also, doing movements too fast can often have less effect in muscle building so that is why the pace is often important in the instruction.Although I felt the original EA Sports Active was a knockout for strength and cardio, I like the new workouts even better and, as a set, it's a winner.Negative: The only thing I wish they would have done is include a more taut band with this version because the original was quite weak and there were several complaints about it as such. As this is a follow up, most would have progressed past that band strength even if they were a beginner. However, they are cheap and easy to find on the 'net but that's really my only gripe.CONCLUSION: One of my top Wii faves...and a mega winner for weight loss in my opinion.",5,"The bodybugg showed it revved the calorie burn, and *I* said it revved the fun!",1259539200,"11 30, 2009",2009,3985,"['First', 'let', 'say', 'wear', 'bodybugg', 'measure', 'daily', 'caloric', 'burn', 'do', 'am', 'also', 'able', 'measure', 'exact', 'calorie', 'burn', 'fitness', 'dvd', 'wii', 'game', 'do', 'not', 'only', 'total', 'workout', 'time', 'also', 'calories', 'burned', 'minute', 'rigid', 'accuracy', 'mention', 'only', 'so', 'know', 'what', 'say', 'calorie', 'burn', 'based', 'scientific', 'measurement', 'rather', 'simply', 'perceived', 'exertion', 'what', 'game', 'burn', 'average', 'person.In', 'comparison', 'other', 'wii', 'fitness', 'games', 'have', 'quite', 'collection', 'one', 'hit', 'bullseye', 'burned', 'more', 'calories', 'playing', 'version', 'even', 'original', 'one', 'offered', 'great', 'caloric', 'burn', 'as', 'well', 'often', 'burned', 'far', 'more', 'game', 'thought', 'would', 'own', 'average', 'measurement', 'far', 'caloric', 'burn', 'versions', 'wii', 'fit', 'Incidentally', 'own', 'measured', 'calorie', 'burn', 'was', 'just', 'slightly', 'more', 'what', 'was', 'read', 'screen', 'quite', 'accurate', 'measurement', 'most', 'games', 'far', 'overestimate', 'calorie', 'burn', 'one', 'was', 'pretty', 'close', 'being', 'right', 'money', 'when', 'compared', 'bodybugg', 'readout', 'actually', 'burned', '25', 'calories', 'more', 'what', 'told', 'burned', 'more', 'importantly', 'time', 'focus', 'was', 'FUN', 'watch', 'Biggest', 'Loser', 'know', 'push', 'harder', 'when', 'competitive', 'aspect', 'working', 'out', 'EA', 'More', 'Workouts', 'took', 'consideration', 'sometimes', 'race', 'others', 'personally', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'workout', 'work', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'new', 'scenery', 'fun', 'games', 'aspect', 'losing', 'weight', 'reminding', 'again', 'challenges', 'Biggest', 'Loser', 'made', 'not', 'watch', 'clock', 'instead', 'get', 'GAME', 'losing', 'weight', 'whole', 'beauty', 'using', 'wii', 'rather', 'fitness', 'dvd', 'had', 'fun', 'forgot', 'was', 'WORK', 'Additionally', 'using', 'fitness', 'band', 'work', 'out', 'muscles', 'do', ""n't"", 'normally', 'reach', 'other', 'workouts', 'also', 'interest', 'something', 'different', 'usual', 'workout', 'routine', 'Should', 'advance', 'game', 'just', 'buy', 'stronger', 'band', 'keep', 'working', 'muscles', 'harder', 'consequently', 'increasing', 'metabolism', 'muscle', 'generation.The', 'game', 'account', 'most', 'effective', 'workouts', 'burn', 'high', 'calories', 'workout', 'add', 'strength', 'training', 'continue', 'burn', 'more', 'calories', 'even', 'rest', 'long', 'game', 'one', 'benefits', 'EA', 'Sports', 'games', 'bodybugg', 'showed', 'increased', 'caloric', 'burn', 'due', 'strength', 'training', 'long', 'stopped', 'game', 'love', 'wii', 'fit', 'balance', 'true', 'calorie', 'burn', 'low', 'love', 'many', 'other', 'wii', 'fitness', 'games', 'high', 'calorie', 'burn', 'often', 'do', ""n't"", 'offer', 'strength', 'training', 'keep', 'up', 'burn', 'important', 'me.The', 'concentration', 'here', 'having', 'fun', 'lose', 'weight', 'goal.Tip', 'Do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'game', 'often', 'reading', 'wiimote', 'hand', 'controls', 'even', 'leg', 'exercises', 'ensure', 'body', 'correct', 'alignment', 'do', ""n't"", 'put', 'down', 'hand', 'when', 'are', 'instructed', 'use', 'always', 'hold', 'shown', 'best', 'accuracy', 'Also', 'doing', 'movements', 'too', 'fast', 'can', 'often', 'have', 'less', 'effect', 'muscle', 'building', 'why', 'pace', 'often', 'important', 'instruction.Although', 'felt', 'original', 'EA', 'Sports', 'Active', 'was', 'knockout', 'strength', 'cardio', 'like', 'new', 'workouts', 'even', 'better', 'set', 'winner.Negative', 'only', 'thing', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'include', 'more', 'taut', 'band', 'version', 'original', 'was', 'quite', 'weak', 'were', 'several', 'complaints', 'such', 'follow', 'up', 'most', 'would', 'have', 'progressed', 'band', 'strength', 'even', 'were', 'beginner', 'However', 'are', 'cheap', 'easy', 'find', ""'net"", 'really', 'only', 'gripe.CONCLUSION', 'One', 'top', 'Wii', 'faves', 'mega', 'winner', 'weight', 'loss', 'opinion']",N/A

1274922,A3ATYXUIKAJH78,B002KJ9XE8,"D. Vance ""krolock""","[44, 46]","I bought the first EA Sports Active game for my wife and I as I was a little bored with the fitness games that we had already. We started with Wii Fit, progressed to My Fitness Coach and then Cardio Workout.Each of these programs were a good workout but with Wii Fit there was very little to get the heart pumping. My Fitness Coach certainly got your heart pumping more but with a limited amount of space it was hard to do some of the step aerobics, in the end I had to modify the routines. With Cardio Workout it was a great little program for getting the heart rate up but I wanted to move a bit more.EA Sports Active came along and my wife and I were taken with the program. We stuck to the challenges and saw a noticeable change in our bodies. With My Fitness Coach we were doing the routines and felt fitter but I felt that I was doing the routines in the wrong position because my knees would ache and it was difficult to bend down and in my job I did that a lot.The only downside I could really see was that with EA Sports Active I would be too competitive with my wife. We did a joint workout once and when we were running around the track I was in the lead. My competative streak got to me and I tried to run faster - of course something happened and I pulled a muscle in my calf. We laughed about it later but it hurt like crazy.When I saw Ea Sports Active More Workouts coming out I was thrilled and hoped to get it straight away. I thought as the original game was so well made then I could expect the same quality from the new game. I'm happy to say I was proved right!EA have taken the original game and tweaked the workouts so that they are a little different but they have kept the core exercise routines and made them more fun. In the original game my wife and I hated the fast kick ups and high knees, now they have changed them slightly and although it's not my favourite it is a little better and doesn't feel as much as a chore.They've now added water skiing which is a good game involving squats. The band work has been tweaked a little and is a little more of a challenge. In the previous game I had already bought the purple and silver band to add more resistance but I find myself going back to the purple a little more while I find my feet with the new exercises.The main reason I'm writing this review is that I discovered 2 days ago the custom workout option. Okay, I knew about this already but this was the first time I had set one up in the new game. I had just tried the step aerobics in my daily workout and I was thrilled! This was the step workout that Wii Fit and My Fitness Coach needed in my opinion. The tempo is fast and even not using a step you had a great workout. Along with the basic step you had kicks, high knees and leg curls all with single or sets. I also included a hard squash game which really made me fly from side to side with my lunges, the pace gradually got faster until you got to the bonus balls where I struggled to keep up, I managed to get 7 out of 10. I also included skipping, I haven't skipped since I was a child so that was a little hard to start with but now I think I could keep pace with a boxer! The final item in my routine was the boxing where the target scroll down the screen and you have to jap and hook to hit them.I tried this routine which was to take about 24 minutes to complete. I kept on saying wow as I progressed and hit 100 calories during the 10 step routine before I had even finished it. As I had said with the squash it certainly has you moving to the left and right as you need to lunge for the balls. The boxing was great as I tried to hit all the targets. after the 24 minutes were up I could hardly believe that according to the program I had burned almost 100 calories more than it estimated I would. I don't know if the calorie count is accurate but that was such a great morivating factor that I couldn't stop telling my wife when she came downstairs. She tried the workout last night and she was thrilled and could really feel it.At this moment in time I would have to say that Ea Sports Active More Workouts is a great game to get as it's taken what was good in the original game and made it better. I was blown away by the step aerobic program. Okay it doesn't have the more advanced step aerobic exercise in My Fitness Coach or the cute graphics in Wii Fit but the tempo is great and the time just flies by. My wife and I liked the tennis but you just stood to one side and tried to hit the ball on the same side - which was okay. The squash game is so much better in that you move more and is so much fun. The boxing is better, I like the targets that scroll down, my wife prefers the sparring partner where you also have to duck and dodge just like in Cardio Workout.I'm concentrating on the items I love in this workout but there are more. My wife likes the island runs where you have an obstacle coarse where you can do lunges, stride jumps, hand cranks, hops on either foot. There's also a run where you have to sprint past runners before you reach the finishing line. I'm still undecided about the push ups and the abdominal exercises such as reverse crunches and punches but I'm sure I'll get to like them when I do have abdominal muscles!One of the things I've often said to my wife was that I would like a fitness program that I would like. I said of Wii Fit that it was fine but I wanted a step program that challenged me and that I could fall in love with - I think I've found it now. I feel confident that I will continue to use this program for a long time. So far my wife has spent 70 hours using the original EA Sports Active and has burned over 50,000 calories. I can now imagine that I will be spending longer on this program as I'm so pumped up with the step program. My wife loves this program as she can carry her information from the original to the new program and she has more choices of exercise.In conclusion if you love the original Ea Sports Active I would seriously consider buying this one too. The games are inproved over the original and in my opinion it's worth it for the step aerobics,boxing and the squash!",5,Sports Active just got better,1259625600,"12 1, 2009",2009,6143,"['bought',

This is more realistic for me than the 5 workouts a week in the 30-day challenge in the original game.Additionally, the exercises in More Workouts seem to challenge the body more in a shorter period of time- using both arms for upper body when possible instead of one at a time, using dynamic moves like lunge to jump, sprinting rather than jogging for a more interval-type workout, and going slightly faster in the reps to keep your heart rate up.Abdominal exercises have been added as well, which is nice.  They are not enough to give you a total abdominal workout, but it is certainly better than nothing.A big improvement is the addition of a warm-up and cool-down.  This was a major flaw in the original program.  It is definitely easier to workout when you are warmed up, and you don't feel as sore if you do the cool down.Other than that, the graphics are great, there are new activities and games that are really fun, and some of the more dreaded exercises like squats and lunges are better disguised as games.I would definitely recommend this product as an add-on to the original EA Sports Active.",5,EVEN better than the original EA Sports Active,1261353600,"12 21, 2009",2009,1358,"['started', 'original', 'EA', 'Sports', 'Active', 'summer', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'then', 'bought', 'More', 'Workouts', 'as', 'soon', 'came', 'out', 'fact', 'More', 'Workouts', 'can', 'do', '6-week', 'challenge', 'allowing', '4', 'workout', 'days', '3', 'rest', 'days', 'more', 'realistic', '5', 'workouts', 'week', '30-day', 'challenge', 'original', 'game.Additionally', 'exercises', 'More', 'Workouts', 'seem', 'challenge', 'body', 'more', 'shorter', 'period', 'time-', 'using', 'arms', 'upper', 'body', 'when', 'possible', 'instead', 'one', 'time', 'using', 'dynamic', 'moves', 'lunge', 'jump', 'sprinting', 'rather', 'jogging', 'more', 'interval-type', 'workout', 'going', 'slightly', 'faster', 'reps', 'keep', 'heart', 'rate', 'up.Abdominal', 'exercises', 'have', 'been', 'added', 'as', 'well', 'nice', 'are', 'not', 'enough', 'give', 'total', 'abdominal', 'workout', 'certainly', 'better', 'nothing.A', 'big', 'improvement', 'addition', 'warm-up', 'cool-down', 'was', 'major', 'flaw', 'original', 'program', 'definitely', 'easier', 'workout', 'when', 'are', 'warmed', 'up', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'sore', 'do', 'cool', 'down.Other', 'graphics', 'are', 'great', 'are', 'new', 'activities', 'games', 'are', 'really', 'fun', 'more', 'dreaded', 'exercises', 'squats', 'lunges', 'are', 'better', 'disguised', 'games.I', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'product', 'add-on', 'original', 'EA', 'Sports', 'Active']",N/A

It's just as good if not better in some ways.  The actual exercises don't seem as well rounded sometimes (there's a lot of jumping around), but the weightlifting exercises and the obstacle courses are nice, as well as the water sports like paddling.  It's a bit like having Sports Resort and Active combined.  That's a good thing.The boxing exercises are more a challenge and squash will make you really loathe squats and lunges, but the quality of the workouts is really high with this one as it also focuses on warming up and cooling down.  The customization is still present, so you don't always have to do the preset workouts even though those are probably much more rounded.I like the six week challenge option in particular because you can do more than one workout in a day if you really like, and you can set up which days you would prefer to do the workouts on, unlike the first one where you were stuck in a particular model and couldn't really change it that much.The weekly stats are really helpful to in helping gauge how well or how badly you might be doing in the overall scheme of your health.  I haven't paid a whole lot of a attention to it until it comes up every week, but it is nice to have on hand as it rates more than just the calories burned.Overall, I really like having this one as a change up to the old routine.  It's not necessarily better, but it is solid and worthwhile since there are a good variety of different workouts to be had than the Active.  Can't say I've really paid much attention to the book that came with the game purchase, but it does seem to be helpful if one is looking to really lose weight or maintain a healthy lifestyle.

1274931,A3NID9D9WMIV01,B002KJ9XE8,"Louie the Italian Jew ""Lou da Joo""","[6, 10]","I have grown to really like EA Sports Active (the original release). My initial reaction for the original disc wasn't that great, but I went out and bought aDYNA-BAND 6ft Purple Heavy Resistance Bandto increase resistance, and slid into a regular routine. It was simple. I made my own workouts. I worked out my upper-body, played some baseball on EA Sports Active, and ended with the long run with the hard difficulty setting on each. Sweet and simple. I didn't set any goals or any of the fluff, and performed standard weightlifting exercises (curls, shoulder presses, kickbacks etc.). I did my thing and turned off the Wii.I later purchased Wii Fit Plus for less money thanEA Sports Active: More Workouts, which included the original Wii Fit exercises plus more fun games to get you in the mood for moving.My biggest problem with this workout disc is switching discs. So, I end up making a choice. Will I workout using this or the original EA Sports Active? I usually chose the original, because there are more standard exercises that work on upper body.For the price, they should have included both exercise routines on one disc. EA is one of those companies that has taken over the gaming industry and has all of the major licenses for sports games and such. They are out to make a profit like every other company, but this game should have been all inclusive just as Wii Fit Plus was. They would still be able to make a profit off the leg straps and resistance bands. I know a lot of people will say, ""Just switch discs, and stop being lazy"". My reply is that it breaks up the routine, waiting for the other disc to load etc., and takes me out of my zone.edit 1/23/10: I wanted to give EA the benefit of the doubt on step aerobics, but I didn't have the time to check each of the step aerobic options before. Why isn't there basic step aerobics using the balance board? Every step aerobics routine using the balance board has leg curl repeaters, high knee repeaters etc. Personally, I don't trust that I'm not going to step squarely on the  balance board every time. I think it's a hazard to have one leg in the air kicking, while you're looking at the television. If you miss the balance board......YIKES!Why isn't there a simple step aerobic routine, where one can just step on the BB while marching?edit: 2/18/10: I kind of feel guilty about my 3 star rating, since I used this product for 10 days in a row straight just setting up boxing exercises for 25 minutes a day. The boxing is becoming addictive, and has been giving me a good workout. One factor that makes the boxing so addictive is that you can continue your routine with only a few seconds interruption between sets. I'm still not to the point where I can say I enjoy this boxing more than Gold's Gym Cardio, but I have been benefiting with this workout routine. I'd like to see what EA could do if they dedicated a disc just to boxing (different backgrounds, settings, and unlockable characters).

I think it would be aerobically beneficial to anyone who is not an avid runner or exercise enthusiast as well.  Other bonuses of this game are the obstacle courses and use of fun diversions to break up the standard ""reps"" portion of the program.  I also appreciate that there are various body styles to choose from when creating your profile - I feel that it is more true to what ""real"" people look like instead of trying to get users to conform to one view of what healthy looks like on the outside.  The 6 week challenge feature is very motivational as well.

1274937,A1KQVDBCSCTUSF,B002KJ9XE8,"Rick Ven ""Classic TV addict""","[2, 2]","I wanted to wait until I had the product for a while before commenting to provide a balanced review.Positives:1. It is a solid game for those who are just getting started in a fitness program. The exercises really don't cause you to over exert yourself while each exercise has three levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard.2. It does allow you to select your music in some of the exercises. However, it is very limited and in cases like the step classes you do not have any choice.3. Whether using the Step or Wii wands the game captures two essential points of your movement: your initial position and the final position. Because the movement between the two is not registered you can do what you want. For example, I hold the nun chuck in my hand for the activities it tells me to put in the leg band.4. Think of it as a good exercise routine with minimal interactivity with the WII gaming devices.5. It does successfully graduate you to having more flexibility, a little more aerobic stamina, and overall readiness for something next.Negatives:1. The leg band. This is a useless concept. I wish I could have the designer explain how they came up with that concept. Unless your knee is wider than your thigh the leg band always will fall down as you perform any of the exercises in the game.2. The exercise routines are very redundant. It did not take long for me to top the program where I have the activities set to Hard and run multiple times because the level is not sufficient to challenge any longer.3. This is the next problem, it take roughly 30-45 seconds between transitioning between activities even if you have the same exercise back to back.

1274939,A2KQG9LFXGI91R,B002KJ9XE8,Tlmsrr,"[0, 0]","I usually hate exercising and choose to walk for awhile instead of do workouts. I find workout video's are too fast pace and hard (same with other console workout games)! The last exercise game I played (while amazing graphics and nice game) it was too fast and hard for me to keep up. I feel this game is very organized and has more options! It has workouts that have a settings for fast, medium, slow, easy, hard, etc. It's great. Not only that, but such a range of exercises to choose from that are long, but you can edit them to be shorter if you like. So far I love doing the step workouts. They are so easy and simple, and I don't mind at all the view (looking out at the beach water)! The music is perfect for the exercises as well. The other activities are really fun too. I mean, like I said, I don't like at all working out, but with this game I want to play it everyday. I haven't even played all the activities yet, but so far each one I really like. You workout to play each activity but, you're having fun doing it, so you don't even realize you're working out! Not to mention, the voice over is perfect for this game and isn't annoying.The only Negative, if so:I don't use the actual leg strap. I either hold the nunchuk and wii remote or put the nunchuk in my shirt pocket. The leg strap was annoying to me (it's not included either).Plus, there are cool down and warm ups-but they are rather brief. I just wish they were longer.

I was pretty impressed with it.I liked how you were able to list your goals, current activity level and so forth.  The voice is pleasant.  The graphics area little shaky and not very crisp.  I have worked with it for a week and have not yet been asked to update my weight,inch loss, etc.  All the music sounds the same.  After a 30 minute workout, you've burned maybe 100-120 calories.  Not enough.But then I ordered EA SPORTS ACTIVE: MORE WORKOUTS and it blew Fitness Coach out of the water!  This program allows you to createan Avatar that looks like you and moves like you.  If you get ahead of the trainer, they pause and ask you to stay with him/her.There is an obstacle course that is a work out and fun!  The scenery, graphics are top of the line.  The interactivity is amazing.The Avatar moves with me.  You get a running calorie counter throughout the workout.  My first 30 minute workout I burned 200calories.I can't say enough about this program.  Love the boxing as well.I am actually looking forward to working out and just doing this program for the 6 week challenge.  Will repeat after that; maybeadd a Wii board (which is an option).Love It!",5,A blast!
