In this film, in the village of Malaria- storm clouds ruined their crops generations ago so the villagers needed another form of income. King Malbert offers the Mad Science Fair to the people to fix that problem. Each year, evil scientists put forth their best devilish creations and those creations fight it out to see who wins.  Then the King will ransom the world NOT to unleash the winner on them. In Malaria, there are lots of Igors to those mad scientists. An Igor to Dr. Glickenstein wants to rise above his task of pulling the switch for the Doctor by creating life on his own. Which he does in the form of Brian and Scamper. Igor gets his big opportunity when the mad doctor blows himself up. Igor creates Eva.  He wants her to be the most evil creation ever, but she is gentle-hearted and only wants to be an actress(thanks to Brian's Brain-washing, lol). Dr. Schadenfeude gets wind that Igor may have created the winning entry for the year with Eva so he makes it his mission to steal Eva from Igor, win the fair, and boot Malbert out as King of Malaria. That's when the fun begins. The movie, itself, is told in a Tim Burtonesque style with tons of references to horror movies and laughs in the old Munsters or The Addams Family Style.Directed by Tony Leondis, the movie stars: John Cusack, Steve Buscemi, John Cleese, Jennifer Coolidge, Arsenio Hall(it's been ages since we've heard from him), Sean Hayes, Eddie Izzard, Jay Leno(in yet-another-CGI film), Molly Shannon, and Christian Slater. The CG animation was created by French studio Sparx.All in all, it's not a bad movie. Given, it may not be up to Pixar standards but it is pretty darned close to it. I really enjoyed it myself, especially given the fact I'm a Universal Monsters fanboy at heart. The family will love this movie.

This holds it own against most of them.For an animated film, it has exactly what you want: fantastic colors and colorful characters -most of them very funny and entertaining to view and hear - and a good story with some interesting twists to it. The artwork in this film is just amazing, especially on Blu-Ray. (I've discovered that's how to watch these new animated movies - in high-def, because most of them look awesome. This film certainly is no exception.) There were many times I just wanted the freeze-frame the picture and take in all the wild artwork. I might do that on a second viewing.Also no surprise is Steve Buscemi, who always gets humorous roles in these animated films and makes everyone laugh. He usually plays a rat, too. I mentioned that to a friend and he said, ""That's because he looks like one in real life."" I wouldn't go that far, but I understand where he's coming from.Actually, all the leading voices - Buscemi, John Cusack, Molly Shannon, Sean Hayes, John Cleese, Jay Leno and more were all great. I'll give a special nod to the voice that cracked me up more than all the others, the one of ""Hedi,"" done by Jennifer Coolidge.

It's not awful bad, it's not great, it's OK.The animation is decent. Fairly bright and colorful, the pallet chosen is pleasing. The characters, well they all look strange. A bit like the Nightmare Before Christmas or Corpse Bride style - big heads, skinny bodies, big eyes, tiny legs.The story is a bit strange in that there's some moderately adult humor in here. Nothing horribly offensive, but sometimes this reviewer wonders why film directors have to go that direction. There's no reason to pepper this in the film.The voice cast is huge and star studded. John Cleese must have believed in this project because he has traditionally not done a film or voice over unless it's important to him. John Cusak, Steve Buscemi, Jay Leno, Christian Slater, and Molly Shannon are the others.The story is what everyone would expect, Igor is an Igor and is never allowed to think or invent anything. He accidently kills his master and is liberated to invent a horrible invention. Instead he invents a nice female monster. And the fun goes from there. There's a tiny amount of Frankenstein and 1930's horror movies in here. It's not really scary.There's a chuckle or two. The animation decent. The voice overs are good. The story line is reasonable.

I love old horror movies and I love wacky comedy, so I figured it might be worth it. I've watched it three times now, enjoying it more each time. True, it gets off to a slow start. John Cusack's voice-over back-story opening is very weak. It's not particularly funny and he doesn't do it well. I almost gave up. But I'm nothing if not persistent. The result: It's a stitch! Once Eva, the monster who thinks she's an actress, takes stage, the movie picks up tremendously. There are funny situations, brilliant one-liners, great acting, clever animation. Okay, I admit it: when the message arrives (""We're all born with an evil bone. It's up to us whether or not we use it.""), it screams: MESSAGE!!!

Most six-year olds know very little about the Frankenstein story other than to recognize the iconic makeup Boris Karloff wore.I believe this story would work far better on the stage than as an animated film. Igor certainly could do no worse on Broadway as the stage adaptation of Shrek was cringe-inducing.In summary, this is an animated film too clever for its own good.

The land was once a fruitful place but climate changes have seen those days long gone and the new world of science replacing it.Every mad scientist in the land attempts a new creation each year in the hopes of winning the coveted prize of top scientist. And each scientist has his own helper, all with the same name, Igor. As they reach the moment of truth in their labs, they all call out the same thing: ""Igor! Throw the switch!""Unfortunately for Dr. Glickenstein (John Cleese), the test run of his invention this year results in his untimely demise. But his Igor (John Cusak) doesn't let anyone know. It seems Igor has a mind of his own and does his own experiments in his off moments. He's brought back a rabbit from the dead and made him immortal (a running joke throughout the film as he finds different ways to attempt to kill himself) and a brain he keeps alive to help him.Igor has done something no one has ever done before. He has assembled a creature of various parts and given it life. Unfortunately inside of this creature is the essence of evil, held in check at present. Instead, Eva (Molly Shannon), his creation, is a romantic at heart and simple as can be.While Igor is working on his creation, Dr. Schadenfreude (Eddie Izzard) is out to win once more, having won year after year. What most don't realize though is that Schadenfreude has stolen all of his ideas and this year doesn't look any different. Using a shape shifting accomplice whose has been flirting with Igor, he attempts to steal Eva and make her the ultimate weapon.A misunderstanding results in Eva leaving Igor and heading to the lab of Dr. Schadenfreude. As he changes her from good to bad, she becomes the weapon he sought as he not only tries to win the competition but to take over the land of Malaria as well. Only Igor and his motley crew can save the day.The production values on this film rank high. It matches those seen in films released by the Disney studio or Pixar. The animation leaves nothing lacking and all involved have done a fine job.Fans of classic horror films will get a kick out of this one. Not only are the elements of those films seen here but some of the sets resemble them as well. And the element of mad scientist and hunchbacked assistant is visible from the first moment. It is a tribute to those classic films.That being said, the film is marketed not to those fans so much but to children. And for some of those children the images here are not user friendly. It is less a matter of them being spooky but in being downright frightful to the mind of a 5 year old. And to have a character whose main goal is to kill himself? It might be a bit much for a young mind to completely comprehend.Had this movie been marketed as a spoof, as a cult film, things might have been different. It is an enjoyable movie to watch. But then again I'm watching it as an adult and not as a child.When one compares the animated output from years ago with those currently hitting screens one has to wonder where the joy in innocence went. Why are we so focused on the ugly things instead of the wonders we saw as children? Even the evil Queen in SLEEPING BEAUTY had a certain amount of elegance and beauty to her. And while that queen turned into a dragon and was slain, there wasn't the same sort of ugly underside as witnessed in today's films.Some would say we watched the coyote decimated by the road runner for years and it never affected us. Then again, it was never done with such detail. IGOR is a good movie. And for those willing to take the time to sit with their children and watch it, explaining the humor and consequences of certain ideas in the film, it could be a family film. But this is not one to allow children to watch on their own.",3,"""PULL THE SWITCH!""",1247356800,"07 12, 2009",2009,4094,"['Thus', 'main', 'line', 'film', 'IGOR', 'computer', 'animated', 'film', 'roots', 'planted', 'firmly', 'land', 'Universal', 'horror', 'tongue', 'firmly', 'cheek.The', 'film', 'place', 'land', 'called', 'Malaria', 'where', 'economy', 'based', 'solely', 'inventions', 'mad', 'scientists', 'seeking', 'ultimate', 'weapons', 'be', 'sold', 'countries', 'globally', 'land', 'was', 'once', 'fruitful', 'place', 'climate', 'changes', 'have', 'seen', 'days', 'long', 'gone', 'new', 'world', 'science', 'replacing', 'it.Every', 'mad', 'scientist', 'land', 'new', 'creation', 'year', 'hopes', 'winning', 'coveted', 'prize', 'top', 'scientist', 'scientist', 'own', 'helper', 'same', 'name', 'Igor', 'reach', 'moment', 'truth', 'labs', 'call', 'out', 'same', 'thing', 'Igor', 'Throw', 'switch', 'Unfortunately', 'Dr.', 'Glickenstein', 'John', 'Cleese', 'test', 'run', 'invention', 'year', 'results', 'untimely', 'demise', 'Igor', 'John', 'Cusak', ""n't"", 'let', 'anyone', 'know', 'Igor', 'mind', 'own', 'own', 'experiments', 'off', 'moments', 'brought', 'back', 'rabbit', 'dead', 'made', 'immortal', 'running', 'joke', 'film', 'different', 'ways', 'attempt', 'kill', 'brain', 'alive', 'help', 'him.Igor', 'done', 'something', 'one', 'ever', 'done', 'before', 'assembled', 'creature', 'various', 'parts', 'given', 'life', 'Unfortunately', 'creature', 'essence', 'evil', 'held', 'check', 'present', 'Instead', 'Eva', 'Molly', 'Shannon', 'creation', 'romantic', 'heart', 'simple', 'can', 'be.While', 'Igor', 'working', 'creation', 'Dr.', 'Schadenfreude', 'Eddie', 'Izzard', 'out', 'win', 'once', 'more', 'having', 'won', 'year', 'year', 'What', 'most', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'though', 'Schadenfreude', 'stolen', 'ideas', 'year', ""n't"", 'look', 'different', 'Using', 'shape', 'shifting', 'accomplice', 'been', 'flirting', 'Igor', 'steal', 'Eva', 'make', 'ultimate', 'weapon.A', 'misunderstanding', 'results', 'Eva', 'leaving', 'Igor', 'heading', 'lab', 'Dr.', 'Schadenfreude', 'good', 'bad', 'weapon', 'sought', 'not', 'only', 'win', 'competition', 'take', 'over', 'land', 'Malaria', 'well', 'Only', 'Igor', 'motley', 'crew', 'can', 'save', 'day.The', 'production', 'values', 'film', 'rank', 'high', 'seen', 'films', 'released', 'Disney', 'studio', 'Pixar', 'animation', 'nothing', 'lacking', 'involved', 'have', 'done', 'fine', 'job.Fans', 'classic', 'horror', 'films', 'will', 'get', 'kick', 'one', 'Not', 'only', 'are', 'elements', 'films', 'seen', 'here', 'sets', 'resemble', 'as', 'well', 'element', 'mad', 'scientist', 'hunchbacked', 'assistant', 'visible', 'first', 'moment', 'tribute', 'classic', 'films.That', 'being', 'said', 'film', 'marketed', 'not', 'fans', 'so', 'much', 'children', 'children', 'images', 'here', 'are', 'not', 'user', 'friendly', 'less', 'matter', 'being', 'spooky', 'being', 'downright', 'frightful', 'mind', '5', 'year', 'old', 'have', 'character', 'main', 'goal', 'kill', 'might', 'be', 'bit', 'much', 'young', 'mind', 'completely', 'comprehend.Had', 'movie', 'been', 'marketed', 'spoof', 'cult', 'film', 'things', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'different', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'watch', 'then', 'again', ""'m"", 'watching', 'adult', 'not', 'child.When', 'one', 'animated', 'output', 'years', 'ago', 'currently', 'hitting', 'screens', 'one', 'wonder', 'where', 'joy', 'innocence', 'went', 'Why', 'are', 'so', 'focused', 'ugly', 'things', 'instead', 'wonders', 'saw', 'children', 'Even', 'evil', 'Queen', 'SLEEPING', 'BEAUTY', 'had', 'certain', 'amount', 'elegance', 'beauty', 'queen', 'turned', 'dragon', 'was', 'slain', 'was', ""n't"", 'same', 'sort', 'ugly', 'underside', 'witnessed', 'today', 'films.Some', 'would', 'say', 'watched', 'coyote', 'decimated', 'road', 'runner', 'years', 'never', 'affected', 'Then', 'again', 'was', 'never', 'done', 'such', 'detail', 'IGOR', 'good', 'movie', 'willing', 'take', 'time', 'sit', 'children', 'watch', 'explaining', 'humor', 'consequences', 'certain', 'ideas', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'family', 'film', 'not', 'one', 'allow', 'children', 'watch', 'own']",N/A

'Igor' is really for old horror buffs, but it tried to play both sides of the field. It's too adult for kids and not dark enough for adults.The animation is very good and looks more than a little inspired by 'The Nightmare Before Christmas'. The voice work isn't bad, but the film doesn't have enough inspired characters to keep the momentum going. Most of the comic relief comes from an immortal rabbit who wants to die!Overall I think if you like old horror films and animated films you'll like 'Igor', but it will not keep the little ones interested.

The story behind Igor is simple enough, a hunchback assistant to a mad scientist takes over for his boss once the boss dies in a lab accident.  This Igor then enters the annual monster-making competition.  In the process, he discovers more about himself, his place in life, and the origins of his society.The story is written as a comedy with parts of romance, action and suspense thrown in.  This movie is quite original, and the cast is excellent, however the biggest failing is the unfunniness of the comedy.  Many of the cast are accomplished comedians such as Jay Leno, John Cleese, and Steve Buscemi so the cast is not to blame for the lack of humor.  I would say that this is due to the scriptwriters.  Much of the comedy occurs as side gags to the main storyline, as if somebody threw them in to try and get a rise from the audience.  Few of the supposed funny scenes advances the story.So overall, an OK movie.

1215584,AHF97M45JFCB,B001LPWGEG,ONENEO,"[1, 2]","I remember previews for Igor on television right around the same time DreamWorks was promoting their monstrous animated Monsters Vs. Aliens and while it's pretty safe to say that this one managed to get lost in the hype created by the big guys, the content here can hardly be blamed.In fact, one of the few factors that actually prevent it from going toe to toe with the giants of the industry is the fact that it was created independently and on a fairly modest budget at that.  The concept, the homage to classic horror flicks, and the sheer cleverness of it all are certainly the type of goodness we expect from the likes of Pixar.Speaking of such things, the tale goes something like this: In the bleak and dismal land of Malaria, children are born into one of only two castes: Mad scientist or Igor (depending upon physical characteristics such as having a hunched back for example).Igor, our Igor is, you guessed it, an Igor, one of the preordained sidekicks to one of Malaria's 13 evil mad scientists upon graduation from Igor school where such skills as the art of switch pulling; slurred speech and tying a proper cloak are taught.  Igor (voiced perfectly by John Cusack) was intelligent enough to graduate with a  ""Yes Masters Degree"" in fact.Igor is assigned to one Dr. Glickenstein (John Cleese) and is forced into a life of suppressing his true intelligence in favor of the servitude that all Igors exist to endure.Creating two sidekicks in Glickenstein's employ (Brain (Sean Hayes), a sentient brain in a glass jar, and Scamper (Steve Buscemi), an immortal suicidal mutant rabbit), Igor works in secret developing an idea unlike any before it: To create genuine life.It turns out that nearly everyone in Malaria aspires to evil genius greatness. Each year, the king selects one wicked man-made device and uses it to blackmail the entire world (which is the basis for Malaria's economic system).Igor just so happens to have created an invention perfect for the task except for two minor problems: The female Frankenstein monster (Eva (Molly Shannon)) he created is anything but evil and evil genius inventions are supposed to come from Mad Scientists, not their hunched over, abused assistants.The visuals of this film are quite well done and fantastically thematic for the gothic undertones of a modern monster movie.  While the textures pale in comparison to works like Pixar or DreamWorks' inflated-budgeted films, there is a lot to be excited about here.The character models are wildly disproportionate (stylized in fact) and pay homage to animated classics like Rankin/Bass' Mad Monster Party while simultaneously sparking Burton-esque tones of disturbia found in pieces like Nightmare Before Christmas and Corpse Bride.Voice work is spectacular with both Cusack and Buscemi in particular providing inspired deliveries.  But even the supporting cast of Molly Shannon and Jennifer Coolidge and Jay Leno do a bang up job.The pacing is consistent and an enjoyable plot structure aids in keeping the film flowing.  Most of the humor will appeal to viewers of all ages and the older set especially may find great enjoyment in picking out the classic monster movie homages sprinkled throughout.About my only complaint with this one is that though always done in good taste, a few of the concepts may be a bit too dark for young-viewer appreciation.  If that's a concern, parents may wish to give this one a viewing beforehand to determine whether or not the material is suitable for the youngsters.In all Igor finally drives home the point that a limitless budget and major studio backing are not requisites in crafting a masterwork of modern computer animation.  I can state with confidence that this film manages to succeed in the monster movie genre more convincingly than either Pixar's Monsters Inc. or DreamWorks' Monsters Vs Aliens.  I suspect that had this screenplay fallen into the proverbial lap of either major studio, a slightly more streamlined prose would have resulted but that's neither here nor there.What is here is charming, filled with heart and the type of cleverness that the computer generated animated feature film has made famous.  After all, as the tag line professes, ""not all men are created evil.""",4,A Monstrously Charming Animated Film,1288656000,"11 2, 2010",2010,4239,"['remember', 'previews', 'Igor', 'television', 'right', 'same', 'time', 'DreamWorks', 'was', 'promoting', 'monstrous', 'animated', 'Monsters', 'Vs.', 'Aliens', 'pretty', 'safe', 'say', 'one', 'managed', 'get', 'lost', 'hype', 'created', 'big', 'guys', 'content', 'here', 'can', 'hardly', 'be', 'blamed.In', 'fact', 'one', 'few', 'factors', 'actually', 'prevent', 'going', 'toe', 'toe', 'giants', 'industry', 'fact', 'was', 'created', 'independently', 'fairly', 'modest', 'budget', 'concept', 'homage', 'classic', 'horror', 'flicks', 'sheer', 'cleverness', 'are', 'certainly', 'type', 'goodness', 'expect', 'likes', 'Pixar.Speaking', 'such', 'things', 'tale', 'something', 'bleak', 'dismal', 'land', 'Malaria', 'children', 'are', 'born', 'one', 'only', 'two', 'castes', 'Mad', 'scientist', 'Igor', 'depending', 'upon', 'physical', 'characteristics', 'such', 'having', 'hunched', 'back', 'example', '.Igor', 'Igor', 'guessed', 'Igor', 'one', 'preordained', 'sidekicks', 'one', 'Malaria', '13', 'evil', 'mad', 'scientists', 'graduation', 'Igor', 'school', 'where', 'such', 'skills', 'art', 'switch', 'pulling', 'slurred', 'speech', 'tying', 'proper', 'cloak', 'are', 'taught', 'Igor', 'voiced', 'perfectly', 'John', 'Cusack', 'was', 'intelligent', 'enough', 'graduate', 'Yes', 'Masters', 'Degree', 'fact.Igor', 'assigned', 'one', 'Dr.', 'Glickenstein', 'John', 'Cleese', 'forced', 'life', 'suppressing', 'true', 'intelligence', 'favor', 'servitude', 'Igors', 'exist', 'endure.Creating', 'two', 'sidekicks', 'Glickenstein', 'employ', 'Brain', 'Sean', 'Hayes', 'sentient', 'brain', 'glass', 'jar', 'Scamper', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'immortal', 'suicidal', 'mutant', 'rabbit', 'Igor', 'secret', 'developing', 'idea', 'create', 'genuine', 'life.It', 'out', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'Malaria', 'aspires', 'evil', 'genius', 'greatness', 'year', 'king', 'one', 'wicked', 'man-made', 'device', 'blackmail', 'entire', 'world', 'basis', 'Malaria', 'economic', 'system', '.Igor', 'just', 'so', 'have', 'created', 'invention', 'perfect', 'task', 'two', 'minor', 'problems', 'female', 'Frankenstein', 'monster', 'Eva', 'Molly', 'Shannon', 'created', 'anything', 'evil', 'evil', 'genius', 'inventions', 'are', 'supposed', 'come', 'Mad', 'Scientists', 'not', 'hunched', 'abused', 'assistants.The', 'visuals', 'film', 'are', 'quite', 'well', 'done', 'fantastically', 'thematic', 'gothic', 'undertones', 'modern', 'monster', 'movie', 'textures', 'pale', 'comparison', 'works', 'Pixar', 'DreamWorks', 'inflated-budgeted', 'films', 'lot', 'be', 'excited', 'here.The', 'character', 'models', 'are', 'wildly', 'disproportionate', 'stylized', 'fact', 'pay', 'homage', 'animated', 'classics', 'Rankin/Bass', 'Mad', 'Monster', 'Party', 'simultaneously', 'sparking', 'Burton-esque', 'tones', 'disturbia', 'found', 'pieces', 'Nightmare', 'Before', 'Christmas', 'Corpse', 'Bride.Voice', 'work', 'spectacular', 'Cusack', 'Buscemi', 'particular', 'providing', 'inspired', 'deliveries', 'even', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Molly', 'Shannon', 'Jennifer', 'Coolidge', 'Jay', 'Leno', 'do', 'bang', 'up', 'job.The', 'pacing', 'consistent', 'enjoyable', 'plot', 'structure', 'aids', 'keeping', 'film', 'flowing', 'Most', 'humor', 'will', 'appeal', 'viewers', 'ages', 'older', 'set', 'especially', 'may', 'find', 'great', 'enjoyment', 'picking', 'out', 'classic', 'monster', 'movie', 'homages', 'sprinkled', 'throughout.About', 'only', 'complaint', 'one', 'always', 'done', 'good', 'taste', 'few', 'concepts', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'too', 'dark', 'young-viewer', 'appreciation', 'concern', 'parents', 'may', 'wish', 'give', 'one', 'viewing', 'beforehand', 'determine', 'not', 'material', 'suitable', 'youngsters.In', 'Igor', 'finally', 'home', 'point', 'limitless', 'budget', 'major', 'studio', 'backing', 'are', 'not', 'requisites', 'crafting', 'masterwork', 'modern', 'computer', 'animation', 'can', 'state', 'confidence', 'film', 'succeed', 'monster', 'movie', 'genre', 'more', 'convincingly', 'Pixar', 'Monsters', 'Inc.', 'DreamWorks', 'Monsters', 'Vs', 'Aliens', 'suspect', 'had', 'screenplay', 'fallen', 'proverbial', 'lap', 'major', 'studio', 'slightly', 'more', 'streamlined', 'prose', 'would', 'have', 'resulted', 'here', 'there.What', 'here', 'charming', 'filled', 'heart', 'type', 'cleverness', 'computer', 'generated', 'animated', 'feature', 'film', 'made', 'famous', 'tag', 'line', 'not', 'men', 'are', 'created', 'evil']",N/A

Thus, next to the King himself, the Mad Scientist was at the top of the heap in the kingdom of Malaria.  Right at the bottom were the Igors--while the scientists got to keep their name, all these ubiquitous hunchbacked helpers shared the same name and the worst jobs in the kingdom.Only one Igor (voiced by John Cusack) never forsook hope.

The humor is sarcastic, and a little sardonic and honestly it probably flies right over 80 percent of it's viewers heads.Maybe I'm biased seeing as how I love pretty much everything Cusak touches, but I for one wouldn't mind adding this one to my dvd collection.",4,"""As somebody I loved once said: It's better to be a good nobody, than an evil somebody.""",1249344000,"08 4, 2009",2009,1706,"['Igor', 'voiced', 'John', 'Cusack', 'ever', 'wanted', 'was', 'be', 'evil', 'scientist', 'unfortunately', 'kingdom', 'Malaria', 'where', 'tale', 'place', 'big', 'ole', 'hunch', 'back', 'could', 'only', 'mean', 'one', 'thing', 'would', 'always', 'be', 'just', 'Igor', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'recycled', 'parts', 'first', 'One', 'day', 'Igor', 'chance', 'prove', 'be', 'can', 'really', 'be', 'evil', 'scientist', 'when', 'master', 'Dr.', 'Glickenstein', 'John', 'Cleese', 'victim', 'own', 'experiment', 'Igor', 'take', 'only', 'chance', 'fulfill', 'dreams', 'winning', 'evil', 'science', 'fair.Igor', 'only', 'two', 'friends', 'help', 'Brain', 'who', 'named', 'Brian', 'accident', 'Sean', 'Hayes', 'Scamper', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'who', 'Igor', 'accidentally', 'made', 'immortal', 'constantly', 'tries', 'commit', 'suicide', 'plan', 'motion', 'when', 'Igor', 'blueprints', 'create', 'life', 'purely', 'evil', 'monster', 'something', 'evil', 'scientist', 'ever', 'done', 'entire', 'history', 'Malaria', 'Only', 'plan', 'awry', 'when', 'Igor', 'activate', 'new', 'creations', 'evil', 'bone', 'Eva', 'Molly', 'Shannon', 'instead', 'overly', 'kind', 'instead', 'destroying', 'cities', 'killing', 'blind', 'orphans', 'dreams', 'becoming', 'actress.Maybe', 'homage', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'definitely', 're-telling', 'Frankenstein', 'Igor', 'still', 'completely', 'fresh', 'poignant', 'look', 'beloved', 'genre', 'film', 'industry', 'horror.Igor', 'creative', 'witty', 'completely', 'different', 'animated', 'film', 'one', 'have', 'seen', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'humor', 'sarcastic', 'little', 'sardonic', 'honestly', 'probably', 'right', '80', 'percent', 'viewers', 'heads.Maybe', ""'m"", 'biased', 'seeing', 'how', 'love', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'Cusak', 'touches', 'one', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'adding', 'one', 'dvd', 'collection']",N/A

While the animation may have been well done to some degree, the plot, characters and actions in the film are scary, and not in the good sense of the word either. I purchased the DVD expecting greatness (which is found in successfully animated films such as Monsters, Inc., The Incredibles, and Toy Story, etc.) gave it the benefit of the doubt while I squirmed in my seat, but halfway through; bored and disgusted, I just threw it in the trash. The movie is pathetic and fails miserably as entertainment. I could find no redeeming features. I couldn't even bring myself to give the DVD away (free) to anyone I knew!

I really did. But I couldn't help feeling through most of the movie that the creators _really_ should've spent more time on the script.  You can see what they were going for, and you can also see how the concept should have been great. But the execution however, never quite hits the mark.A big problem is the design. You cannot watch Igor without comparing it to The Nightmare Before Christmas, not only because of the stop-action animation similarity but because the sheer look of the film seems so clearly derivative of Nightmare Before Christmas. Eva is modelled on Sally, and I could swear that they actually reused Nightmare's Mayor action figure for Igor's King Malbert. And even if you can get past the visual derivation, there's the problem of characters seeming derivative.  Brain, the classic sci-fi/horror ""brain in a jar"", has a personality derived from a different source: B.O.B. the Blob in Monsters Vs Aliens.Only two characters really stand out. Igor (voiced by John Cusack) is clearly drawn and likeable and can _almost_ make you care enough to ignore the film's short-comings.  And Scamper (voiced by the inimitable Steve Buscemi) is actually the best thing about the film:  an acerbic, immortal rabbit who wants desperately to commit suicide.  And who has all of the best lines:Igor: [shouts] Pull the switch![Nothing happens. He looks over at Scamper, standing by the switch]Scamper: Do *not* yell at me.Igor: Oh, I-I'm sorry. I just... pull the switch?[No response]Igor: Please pull the switch.Scamper: That's better.Brain: Our work here is done.Scamper: 'Our work'? You spent the whole time playing with a piece of ribbon.Igor isn't a bad film. It's an okay film with occasional moments where it's actually good. But it could've been a really good film if the writers and designers had just given it one more good going-over before putting it into production. Recommended for fans of stop-action animation and of spoofs of horror films with an hour and a half to kill.

Growing up, the Westinghouse/Intel science fair always inspired me - you know, the one where high-school students present their masters- or doctorate-level research. The kids in the top ranks were my peer heroes (Me? Their peer? As if). So of course I had warm feelings toward another kid who wanted to do well in the science fair.'Igor' tells an amusing story of that science-fair kid. Even after losing his mentor, or because of losing him, Igor struggles down to the deadline to complete his project. (That much sounds very familiar.) Then, as in any good science fair project, there's a last minute glitch. This is the Evil Science Fair. Only evil science can qualify. Igor's project doesn't seem evil at all. In fact, his monster doesn't have an evil bone in her body. Well, maybe she does, but it doesn't work at all. Then there's the competition ...Animation works well in this movie, especially over-the-top exaggerations in each character's appearance. Eva (no relation to Wall-E's Eve) gives a stunning performance of the Tomorrow song from Annie, literally stunning. Even though a side-kick himself, Igor has his own amusing side-kicks, including a suicidal but immortal bunny whose self-inflicted violence ends up as harmless as any from Tom and Jerry. On the whole, it's a mild but enjoyable bit of kid-safe fluff.Go ahead.
