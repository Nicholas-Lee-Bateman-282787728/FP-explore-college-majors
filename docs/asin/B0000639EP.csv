694082,A29Y34ALWJUGB5,B0000639EP,"Antonio D. Paolucci ""Collector of Entertainment""","[1, 1]","Berserk is one of those few anime fantasies that aren't meant to make us laugh. From the first moments to the last, it's as serious as possible. Dark imagery rules this series, with battles and blood and characters that are often angry and trying to prove themselves in some way or another. And the themes are even darker, dealing with vengeance and a hunger for death.In volume one of Berserk, we are introduced, in the first episode, to the Black Swordsman, a massive man who carries a massive sword. Though we aren't with the Black Swordsman for long, we are introduced through him to the future of this anime series, and to the themes I mentioned before. From there, it gets into the core story of Guts (who becomes the Black Swordsman) growing into a man working as a professional killer. He's a silent, efficient warrior, who's only out for the bounty. But then he meets Griffith, the charismatic leader of the Band of the Hawk, a mercenary group as proficient at killing as a group as Guts is at killing alone. Guts is defeated by Griffith in battle, and is forced to join the Band. It's something that he's never had before, companionship, and he initially wants nothing to do with the Band. Over time, however, he's able to do something he's never been able to do before, and that's find friendship. Though he's still a loner in battle, he feels that his hastiness is more a way to keep his men alive than for actual personal gain. By the end of the volume, Guts leads his own unit of men in the Band of the Hawk, and all his men look up to him as the hero he's become.The first volume begins with a story far in the future, and from there it's actually a series of flashbacks telling the difficult past of the Black Swordsman, and how he, as Guts, got to where he is now. The early parts of the story is relatively light, but the promise of that first episode is profound, because we already know that, no matter what, something bad is eventually going to happen. And that, to me, is what hurts this series. It seems that Guts's past is nothing compared to his future. Though the story itself is good, why didn't they begin the story a little further ahead, and have shorter flashbacks?Despite that, though, the beginning of Berserk is still good and shouldn't be ignored. I'd recommend this to those of you who've read the manga, or for fans of a similar anime series, Record of Lodoss War and it's many sequels and prequels. The darkness of this series, the hopelessness that surrounds the main character Guts (later the Black Swordsman), is a different spin that can't be found often in fantasy anime.",4,Dark Fantasy,1136851200,"01 10, 2006",2006,2614,"['Berserk', 'one', 'few', 'anime', 'fantasies', 'are', ""n't"", 'meant', 'make', 'laugh', 'first', 'moments', 'last', 'as', 'serious', 'possible', 'Dark', 'imagery', 'rules', 'series', 'battles', 'blood', 'characters', 'are', 'often', 'angry', 'trying', 'prove', 'way', 'themes', 'are', 'even', 'darker', 'dealing', 'vengeance', 'hunger', 'death.In', 'volume', 'one', 'Berserk', 'are', 'introduced', 'first', 'episode', 'Black', 'Swordsman', 'massive', 'man', 'who', 'massive', 'sword', 'are', ""n't"", 'Black', 'Swordsman', 'long', 'are', 'introduced', 'future', 'anime', 'series', 'themes', 'mentioned', 'before', 'there', 'core', 'story', 'Guts', 'who', 'Black', 'Swordsman', 'growing', 'man', 'working', 'professional', 'killer', 'silent', 'efficient', 'warrior', 'who', 'only', 'out', 'bounty', 'then', 'Griffith', 'charismatic', 'leader', 'Band', 'Hawk', 'mercenary', 'group', 'proficient', 'killing', 'group', 'Guts', 'killing', 'alone', 'Guts', 'defeated', 'Griffith', 'battle', 'forced', 'join', 'Band', 'something', 'never', 'had', 'companionship', 'initially', 'nothing', 'do', 'Band', 'time', 'however', 'able', 'do', 'something', 'never', 'been', 'able', 'do', 'find', 'friendship', 'still', 'loner', 'battle', 'hastiness', 'more', 'way', 'keep', 'men', 'alive', 'actual', 'personal', 'gain', 'end', 'volume', 'Guts', 'own', 'unit', 'men', 'Band', 'Hawk', 'men', 'look', 'up', 'hero', 'become.The', 'first', 'volume', 'story', 'far', 'future', 'actually', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'telling', 'difficult', 'past', 'Black', 'Swordsman', 'how', 'Guts', 'got', 'where', 'now', 'early', 'parts', 'story', 'relatively', 'light', 'promise', 'first', 'episode', 'profound', 'already', 'know', 'matter', 'what', 'something', 'bad', 'eventually', 'going', 'happen', 'what', 'series', 'Guts', 'past', 'nothing', 'compared', 'future', 'story', 'good', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'begin', 'story', 'little', 'further', 'ahead', 'have', 'shorter', 'flashbacks', 'though', 'beginning', 'Berserk', 'still', 'good', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'ignored', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'who', ""'ve"", 'read', 'manga', 'fans', 'similar', 'anime', 'series', 'Record', 'Lodoss', 'War', 'many', 'sequels', 'prequels', 'darkness', 'series', 'hopelessness', 'main', 'character', 'Guts', 'later', 'Black', 'Swordsman', 'different', 'spin', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'found', 'often', 'fantasy', 'anime']","Berserk: War Cry, Vol. 1"

This series is definately not for children.  The story is of a mercenary named Guts and set in a world similar to Lodoss War, but with fewer fantastic creatures and different odd races (most all of the characters are human, with a few exceptions).  Do not expect to see a bunch of elves and dwarves and dragons, the non-human characters are few and far between through the first 5 episodes.One hilarious bonus feature on all of the Berserk DVDs is the Outtakes.  Basically, it is a series of line reading errors placed over the same scene in the original anime scenes.  Watch them after viewing all of the episodes on the DVD so that you understand the context, but they are truly hilarious.

The main reason I dig anime is for the fantastic artwork and stylistic animation.  I know this is a series of episodes and not a movie, but the action is very stilted.In one scene when two characters are dueling with swords on top of a hill, their blades lock and they freeze-then there is a watercolor painting of the same scene while you hear the sound effects of swords clanging in the background.Maybe I'm spoiled by other anime I've seen, but this is just not what I'm paying for.  I want to see actual frame by frame movement, not still frames with only a mouth moving on a character's face.  I know that anime has it's own tricks it employs and usually does so to great effect, but this looks lazy or rushed.

694086,AL48Y1OYJZIJ5,B0000639EP,"Fates Puppet ""lifespuppet""","[0, 1]","To start, I have only seen this first dvd in the series, so I am not going to discuss the entire story, only this one dvd.  This disk contains the first 5 episodes, and the box set that this edition is included in can hold all 6 volumes.The box itself is very unique in that it isn't the standard 5 sided affair.  Instead, it works like a giant clamshell to completely cover the individual cases.  That aside, this disk looks to be the start of a wonderful series.The first episode, in my opinion, is allowing the viewers a glimpse at the current state of the main character.  You can tell he is a hardened warrior, and he has both the skills and the scars to prove it.  However, the next 4 episodes go back into the character's past to show his growth.I found this to be extremely interesting.  These episodes amount to a very large flashback, and each contains mini-flashbacks to the character's youth.  At the same time, they tell the story of how this character went from a wandering mercenary to become a leading force in one of the best mercenary armies around.  They also tell of his friendship with the very enigmatic leader of this army.All in all, this disk lays a very interesting groundwork for what is definitely not your ordinary sword and sworcery anime.  Besides the first episode, there is no hint of magic at all.  This makes you wonder how that fits into the story, as well as how the main character got to that point.As others have mentioned, there is also the interesting tidbit about the main character's sword.  Already abnormally huge, it slowly evolves and grows as the character's own strength and prowess grows.  After glimpsing its size in episode #1, and then seeing how it started, one wonders how large it will get by series end.As far as technical specs go, this dvd has a good assortment of extras.  The standard trailors for other series are joined by a selection of artwork and concept sketches.  My favorite extra, though, has to be the voice-over outtakes.  These are where the voice actors mispoke or completely ignored the script while dubbing, and the creators have given us a glimpse at this along with the scenes that they were working on.  In the end, these are hilarious, and they help lighten the mood of an otherwise very dark dvd.",4,Very Engrossing,1056067200,"06 20, 2003",2003,2277,"['start', 'have', 'only', 'seen', 'first', 'dvd', 'series', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'discuss', 'entire', 'story', 'only', 'one', 'dvd', 'disk', 'first', '5', 'episodes', 'box', 'set', 'edition', 'included', 'can', 'hold', '6', 'volumes.The', 'box', 'very', 'unique', ""n't"", 'standard', '5', 'sided', 'affair', 'Instead', 'giant', 'clamshell', 'completely', 'cover', 'individual', 'cases', 'aside', 'disk', 'be', 'start', 'wonderful', 'series.The', 'first', 'episode', 'opinion', 'allowing', 'viewers', 'glimpse', 'current', 'state', 'main', 'character', 'can', 'tell', 'hardened', 'warrior', 'skills', 'scars', 'prove', 'However', 'next', '4', 'episodes', 'go', 'back', 'character', 'past', 'show', 'growth.I', 'found', 'be', 'extremely', 'interesting', 'episodes', 'amount', 'very', 'large', 'flashback', 'mini-flashbacks', 'character', 'youth', 'same', 'time', 'tell', 'story', 'how', 'character', 'went', 'wandering', 'mercenary', 'become', 'leading', 'force', 'one', 'best', 'mercenary', 'armies', 'also', 'tell', 'friendship', 'very', 'enigmatic', 'leader', 'army.All', 'disk', 'very', 'interesting', 'groundwork', 'what', 'definitely', 'not', 'ordinary', 'sword', 'sworcery', 'anime', 'first', 'episode', 'hint', 'magic', 'wonder', 'how', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'how', 'main', 'character', 'got', 'point.As', 'others', 'have', 'mentioned', 'also', 'interesting', 'tidbit', 'main', 'character', 'sword', 'Already', 'abnormally', 'huge', 'slowly', 'character', 'own', 'strength', 'prowess', 'grows', 'glimpsing', 'size', 'episode', '1', 'then', 'seeing', 'how', 'started', 'one', 'how', 'large', 'will', 'get', 'series', 'end.As', 'far', 'as', 'technical', 'specs', 'go', 'dvd', 'good', 'assortment', 'extras', 'standard', 'trailors', 'other', 'series', 'are', 'joined', 'selection', 'artwork', 'concept', 'sketches', 'favorite', 'extra', 'though', 'be', 'voice-over', 'outtakes', 'are', 'where', 'voice', 'actors', 'mispoke', 'completely', 'ignored', 'script', 'dubbing', 'creators', 'have', 'given', 'glimpse', 'scenes', 'were', 'working', 'end', 'are', 'hilarious', 'help', 'lighten', 'mood', 'otherwise', 'very', 'dark', 'dvd']","Berserk: War Cry, Vol. 1"

Just about one of the greatest midevil/fantasy war animes I've ever seen, heck, almost THE greatest anime series I've ever seen!  A deeply riveting and powerful story about loyalty, trust, friendship, betrayal, ambitions and dreams.  The characters are absolutely amazing, how they each have their own dreams and goals that they fight fearsomely for, and their struggles to find themselves and their places in life.  The main character, Gutts, is without a doubt one of the best anime characters you'll ever come across.  Not only does he absolutely destroy with that enormous sword, but his journey through life and his turmoils as he tries to find himself are extrodinary and touching.  And personally, I think he's really cute too.  :P  Totally different from any series you will ever see, this anime is remarkable, EXCEPT (like most anime shows), the ending leaves you feeling cheated, depressed and a little angry as you never see what actually happens to the characters after.  Thats why I gave it 4 stars, it really is a 5, just the ending ruins it.

In keeping with the manga, which is still ongoing, this series plays hardball with the viewer's sensibilities continually confronting us with a very realistic view of the horrors of warfare even as it spins out its noir fantasy.As many Anime series do, the first episode, 'the Black Swordsman,' is really from the middle of the story.  Our first view of Guts, a hair-trigger killer with a sword the size of a sidewinder missile, is as he enters a town terrorized by a demonic overlord who feeds on human terror and misery.  The town's garrison is compose of criminals who think nothing of torturing children, but the Black Swordsman steps in - to late to save the town, but in time to challenge the author of all the misery.In the next four episodes, the story returns to its beginning, and we meet the young Guts and see him starting out as a foundling tagalong to a mercenary band.  His childhood is every bit as grim as one might imagine, as he is force to kill his leader and then flees from on battle to the next.  Finally, he comes against the Band of the Hawk and its leader Griffith, and for the first time in years is overmastered by a swordsman.  Griffith sees the real value and strength hidden in the young warrior and is determined to add Guts to his troop rather than kill him.Griffith's effeminate appearance hides a tough warrior and a proven battle master.  When he finally penetrates through the layers of emotional protectiveness that Guts hides behind a strong and mutually agreeable relationship develops.  Guts has troubles adjusting to this new, and disciplined, military unit, but he gradually earns the admiration of almost all of them, including the thorny Caska, a woman who is fiercely loyal to Griffith and his belief in destiny.For all its violence, 'Berserk' strikes many sympathetic chords.  It isn't mindless violence, there is an underlying plot, and the production values and artwork are excellent.  Dialogue displays an unexpected complexity that signals almost from the beginning that this series is something special.  Keep in mind that it deals with some controversial issues, and is aimed at a mature audience.",5,A man wields his sword in order to depart life with a smile.,1039737600,"12 13, 2002",2002,2318,"['Kento', 'Miura', 'original', 'Manga', ""'Young"", 'Animal', 'basis', 'series', 'uncomfortable', 'gritty', 'story', 'medieval', 'warfare', 'magic', 'rarely', 'punches', 'keeping', 'manga', 'still', 'ongoing', 'series', 'hardball', 'viewer', 'sensibilities', 'continually', 'confronting', 'very', 'realistic', 'view', 'horrors', 'warfare', 'even', 'out', 'noir', 'fantasy.As', 'many', 'Anime', 'series', 'do', 'first', 'episode', 'Black', 'Swordsman', 'really', 'middle', 'story', 'first', 'view', 'Guts', 'hair-trigger', 'killer', 'sword', 'size', 'sidewinder', 'missile', 'town', 'terrorized', 'demonic', 'overlord', 'who', 'human', 'terror', 'misery', 'town', 'garrison', 'compose', 'criminals', 'who', 'think', 'nothing', 'torturing', 'children', 'Black', 'Swordsman', 'late', 'save', 'town', 'time', 'challenge', 'author', 'misery.In', 'next', 'four', 'episodes', 'story', 'beginning', 'meet', 'young', 'Guts', 'see', 'starting', 'out', 'foundling', 'tagalong', 'mercenary', 'band', 'childhood', 'bit', 'as', 'grim', 'one', 'might', 'imagine', 'force', 'kill', 'leader', 'then', 'flees', 'battle', 'next', 'Finally', 'Band', 'Hawk', 'leader', 'Griffith', 'first', 'time', 'years', 'overmastered', 'swordsman', 'Griffith', 'real', 'value', 'strength', 'hidden', 'young', 'warrior', 'determined', 'add', 'Guts', 'troop', 'rather', 'kill', 'him.Griffith', 'effeminate', 'appearance', 'tough', 'warrior', 'proven', 'battle', 'master', 'When', 'finally', 'layers', 'emotional', 'protectiveness', 'Guts', 'strong', 'mutually', 'agreeable', 'relationship', 'Guts', 'troubles', 'adjusting', 'new', 'disciplined', 'military', 'unit', 'gradually', 'admiration', 'almost', 'including', 'thorny', 'Caska', 'woman', 'who', 'fiercely', 'loyal', 'Griffith', 'belief', 'destiny.For', 'violence', 'strikes', 'many', 'sympathetic', 'chords', ""n't"", 'mindless', 'violence', 'underlying', 'plot', 'production', 'values', 'artwork', 'are', 'excellent', 'Dialogue', 'unexpected', 'complexity', 'almost', 'beginning', 'series', 'something', 'special', 'Keep', 'mind', 'controversial', 'issues', 'aimed', 'mature', 'audience']","Berserk: War Cry, Vol. 1"

Anime also has the undeniable power of telling an interesting story.  I picked up ""Berserk 1: War Cry"" because it looked like something that was promising.  After watching all of the first disc, I immediately ran out of the house to pick up the next two volumes and plan on getting the last remaining three very shortly.  ""Berserk"" is a dark and haunting series that doesn't hold back for one single second.The town of Midland is covered in darkness and evil as it is controlled by a treacherous king.  Things change one night when a stranger by the name of Guts comes to town with vengeance on his mind.  He fights with a sword that is twice his size and has uncontrollable urges of rage that gets the best of him.  One thing is for sure as this exciting series begins; Guts is willing to wage a one-man war against the one who has done him wrong no matter what the cost.The first episode deals with what's going on in the present while the other four deal with the past and history of Guts.  While it's hard to know exactly what is going on with only the first five episodes, they are extremely involving and exciting.  I found myself watching all five episodes in a row and wanting to watch more.  I always admire stories that deal with flawed heroes, as those are the ones you can relate to the most.  By no way is Guts a superhero by any means.  He has demons and flaws, just like everybody else.  While his strength and will is incredible and sometimes over-the-top, we buy into it because the character of Guts is portrayed with real flaws and emotion.  So long as you can create a believable main character, everything else is fair game.Be warned; this is no show for children.  Just from seeing the first five episodes, I can already tell that it's only going to get darker and more disturbing.  The episodes contain strong and brutal violence, extreme amounts of blood and gore, nudity, and dark and disturbing themes and imagery.  The DVD contains outtakes, production sketches, trailers, and an art gallery.""Berserk 1: War Cry"" shows a promising and exciting start to a dark and haunting series.  I cannot wait to watch the others and anticipate that it will be time well spent.  If you're looking for some good and dark anime with interesting characters, ""Berserk"" might be something that you'll want to check out.  Be sure to watch all five episodes before making any conclusions as to if you like what you're seeing.  The ""Berserk"" series has a powerful start--can't wait to see where it's going to take me next.",5,An Interesting and Powerful Start to a Promising Series...,1074038400,"01 14, 2004",2004,2669,"['Recently', ""'ve"", 'been', 'getting', 'more', 'more', 'interested', 'art', 'anime', 'Anime', 'exciting', 'thrilling', 'deep', 'even', 'disturbing', 'times', 'Anime', 'also', 'undeniable', 'power', 'telling', 'interesting', 'story', 'picked', 'up', 'Berserk', '1', 'War', 'Cry', 'looked', 'something', 'was', 'promising', 'watching', 'first', 'disc', 'immediately', 'ran', 'house', 'pick', 'up', 'next', 'two', 'volumes', 'plan', 'getting', 'last', 'remaining', 'three', 'very', 'shortly', 'Berserk', 'dark', 'haunting', 'series', ""n't"", 'hold', 'back', 'one', 'single', 'second.The', 'town', 'Midland', 'covered', 'darkness', 'evil', 'controlled', 'treacherous', 'king', 'Things', 'change', 'one', 'night', 'when', 'stranger', 'name', 'Guts', 'town', 'vengeance', 'mind', 'sword', 'twice', 'size', 'uncontrollable', 'urges', 'rage', 'best', 'One', 'thing', 'sure', 'exciting', 'series', 'Guts', 'willing', 'wage', 'one-man', 'war', 'one', 'who', 'done', 'wrong', 'matter', 'what', 'cost.The', 'first', 'episode', 'deals', 'what', 'going', 'present', 'other', 'four', 'deal', 'past', 'history', 'Guts', 'hard', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'going', 'only', 'first', 'five', 'episodes', 'are', 'extremely', 'involving', 'exciting', 'found', 'watching', 'five', 'episodes', 'row', 'wanting', 'watch', 'more', 'always', 'admire', 'stories', 'deal', 'flawed', 'heroes', 'are', 'ones', 'can', 'relate', 'most', 'way', 'Guts', 'superhero', 'means', 'demons', 'flaws', 'just', 'everybody', 'else', 'strength', 'will', 'incredible', 'sometimes', 'over-the-top', 'buy', 'character', 'Guts', 'portrayed', 'real', 'flaws', 'emotion', 'So', 'long', 'can', 'create', 'believable', 'main', 'character', 'everything', 'else', 'fair', 'game.Be', 'warned', 'show', 'children', 'Just', 'seeing', 'first', 'five', 'episodes', 'can', 'already', 'tell', 'only', 'going', 'get', 'darker', 'more', 'disturbing', 'episodes', 'contain', 'strong', 'brutal', 'violence', 'extreme', 'amounts', 'blood', 'gore', 'nudity', 'dark', 'disturbing', 'themes', 'imagery', 'DVD', 'outtakes', 'production', 'sketches', 'trailers', 'art', 'gallery', 'Berserk', '1', 'War', 'Cry', 'promising', 'exciting', 'start', 'dark', 'haunting', 'series', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'watch', 'others', 'anticipate', 'will', 'be', 'time', 'well', 'spent', ""'re"", 'looking', 'good', 'dark', 'anime', 'interesting', 'characters', 'Berserk', 'might', 'be', 'something', ""'ll"", 'want', 'check', 'out', 'Be', 'sure', 'watch', 'five', 'episodes', 'making', 'conclusions', 'like', 'what', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'Berserk', 'series', 'powerful', 'start', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'where', 'going', 'take', 'next']","Berserk: War Cry, Vol. 1"

A story that is wonderful full of mystery and hidden secrets that are just waiting to be unveiled. I will be watching this over and over again. The massive power that Guts wills with his equally massive sword is amazing to watch. Finding out who and where Guts came from really interested me.Guts is a character to remember for all time. I have to mention that in some of the fight scenes the spray of blood is amazing to watch although it is gory and may make some squeamish at times. I was not squeamish at all. I thought the blood and all the other scenes were beautiful and fantastic to watch.Watch this anime with caution for younger viewers under age 16 who might be disturbed by the gory violence.

694095,A1KX0865MSEMUG,B0000639EP,Moshella,"[2, 2]","Yes, finally, finally, finally--There is an anime that doesn't follow the pack, that doesn't depend entirely on cliches, or have incredibly annoying and unrealistic characters! Finally!It's been a long time since I've gotten so excited over a series. I've been watching anime since about 1995 or so, and over the years, I've become jaded (I think I share this sentiment with a fellow reviewer of this show). Nothing was exciting, everything was so alike and so boring. But then I took a chance on this show, and am so happy that I did. This series is a breath of fresh air.Taking place in a fictional Medieval-type world, we are introduced to the character Guts, an ""anti-hero"" if there ever was one. Massive, muscle-bound, and scarred, Guts is not the usual type seen heading up a series these days--this position seems to be reserved for scantily-clad females or pretty boys--and in no sense is he perfect. He is blunt, crude, and rarely speaks. A fierce warrior trained from a young age, he kills because it's all he knows. He does, however, seem to have morals, they just aren't that obvious all the time.The tale takes its time to unravel. In episode one, we see where Guts is going to end up, as ""The Black Swordsman"" on the path of revenge. But for what, it isn't entirely certain. The series rewinds over the next episodes and Guts's past is revealed. There are many demonic overtones to the show, and Guts's origins become crystal-clear as the series moves on.This disc covers Guts's beginnings in the Band of the Hawk, a legendary army of bandits and mercenaries that are attempting to reach the goal that their leader, the charismatic Griffith, wants to attain--to rule an empire. Griffith realized the moment he met Guts that he would be the man to help him realize this dream. The reluctant Guts is forced into joining after losing a duel to Griffith, much to the dismay of Casca, the only woman in the Band of the Hawk who has an extreme loyalty to Griffith.""But are Guts and Griffith GAY?"" This issue seems to come up a lot with this show. Sure, at times, it seems like Guts and Griffith ""got it goin' on"", but there is no concrete evidence to support this theory. Sure, Griffith is one of those ""pretty boys"", and yeah, he and Guts do share a strong loyalty that deepens as the show progresses, but as far as romantic love goes, if you judge it all on body language and longing gazes--I guess each viewer can draw his own conclusions.""Berserk"" is one of those rare shows that sucks the viewer in because of its very unpredictabilty. Since its center is war and violence, you really don't know what's going to happen. There are no set ""formulas"", like those used in so many other series. Every show runs its own course in a different and unique way, and the way it's told is part of what makes it so compelling. The character design is gorgeous--no insanely big eyes, the proportions make sense, and some of the characters actually have noses (gasp!). There are some issues that come up like attempted rape, the murder of a child, and child abuse, but it isn't overdone or ""glorified"" in any sense. This show is really quite intelligent and unique and should not be missed by the TRUE anime fan.",5,FINALLY!,1050364800,"04 15, 2003",2003,3210,"['Yes', 'finally', 'finally', 'finally', 'anime', ""n't"", 'follow', 'pack', ""n't"", 'depend', 'entirely', 'cliches', 'have', 'incredibly', 'annoying', 'unrealistic', 'characters', 'Finally', 'been', 'long', 'time', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'so', 'excited', 'series', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'anime', '1995', 'so', 'years', ""'ve"", 'become', 'jaded', 'think', 'share', 'sentiment', 'fellow', 'reviewer', 'show', 'Nothing', 'was', 'exciting', 'everything', 'was', 'so', 'alike', 'so', 'boring', 'then', 'took', 'chance', 'show', 'am', 'so', 'happy', 'did', 'series', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air.Taking', 'place', 'fictional', 'Medieval-type', 'world', 'are', 'introduced', 'character', 'Guts', 'anti-hero', 'ever', 'was', 'one', 'Massive', 'muscle-bound', 'scarred', 'Guts', 'not', 'usual', 'type', 'seen', 'heading', 'up', 'series', 'days', 'position', 'be', 'reserved', 'scantily-clad', 'females', 'pretty', 'boys', 'sense', 'perfect', 'blunt', 'crude', 'rarely', 'speaks', 'fierce', 'warrior', 'trained', 'young', 'age', 'however', 'seem', 'have', 'morals', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'obvious', 'time.The', 'tale', 'time', 'unravel', 'episode', 'one', 'see', 'where', 'Guts', 'going', 'end', 'up', 'Black', 'Swordsman', 'path', 'revenge', 'what', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'certain', 'series', 'next', 'episodes', 'Guts', 'past', 'revealed', 'are', 'many', 'demonic', 'overtones', 'show', 'Guts', 'origins', 'become', 'crystal-clear', 'series', 'on.This', 'disc', 'Guts', 'beginnings', 'Band', 'Hawk', 'legendary', 'army', 'bandits', 'mercenaries', 'are', 'attempting', 'reach', 'goal', 'leader', 'charismatic', 'Griffith', 'attain', 'rule', 'empire', 'Griffith', 'realized', 'moment', 'met', 'Guts', 'would', 'be', 'man', 'help', 'realize', 'dream', 'reluctant', 'Guts', 'forced', 'joining', 'losing', 'duel', 'Griffith', 'much', 'dismay', 'Casca', 'only', 'woman', 'Band', 'Hawk', 'who', 'extreme', 'loyalty', 'Griffith', 'are', 'Guts', 'Griffith', 'GAY', 'issue', 'come', 'up', 'lot', 'show', 'Sure', 'times', 'Guts', 'Griffith', 'got', 'goin', 'concrete', 'evidence', 'support', 'theory', 'Sure', 'Griffith', 'one', 'pretty', 'boys', 'yeah', 'Guts', 'do', 'share', 'strong', 'loyalty', 'show', 'as', 'far', 'romantic', 'love', 'judge', 'body', 'language', 'longing', 'gazes', 'guess', 'viewer', 'can', 'draw', 'own', 'conclusions', 'Berserk', 'one', 'rare', 'shows', 'viewer', 'very', 'unpredictabilty', 'center', 'war', 'violence', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'are', 'set', 'formulas', 'used', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'series', 'Every', 'show', 'own', 'course', 'different', 'unique', 'way', 'way', 'told', 'part', 'what', 'so', 'compelling', 'character', 'design', 'gorgeous', 'insanely', 'big', 'eyes', 'proportions', 'make', 'sense', 'characters', 'actually', 'have', 'noses', 'gasp', 'are', 'issues', 'come', 'up', 'attempted', 'rape', 'murder', 'child', 'child', 'abuse', ""n't"", 'overdone', 'glorified', 'sense', 'show', 'really', 'quite', 'intelligent', 'unique', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'TRUE', 'anime', 'fan']","Berserk: War Cry, Vol. 1"

While at a local store that sold fansub tapes, I decided to pick up the first volume which had the first 2 episodes on it.  I had remembered the berserk video game  being  released for the sega dreamcast, but dident think much of it.  After viewing the first two episodes, I was completely hooked.....Story: The story is great because of its charecter development.  Everyone is explored throughout the serius, involving dark moments, such as guts's past, to hillarious moments, with coborlwitz's idiotic military ramblings.  The story takes place in a midevil european type of atsmophere, which provides a vivid geography for fantasy storytelling.  All in all, the story is about guts's journey through this dark world, until where the story began in episode one.  It involves mysticisim, religion,fantasy, politics, philsophy, and romance.  The realistic depections of these themes further entices the viewers interest.  This is definatly a thinking man's anime, even though it has lots of violence, rape, and nudity.Music:The music in the serius is great.  It varies from celtic tunes, to tribal beats, to j-pop-ish music.  The engrishy opening music is kind of funny, but the ending theme music is haunting from the first note, causing you to look around your room for monsters that may jump out and attack you.Animation:For what it is, the animation is not too bad.  It is low budget, but it was ran late a night.  I personally think the rugged look is quite unique.Packaging:The individual dvd packages are good.  They are all designed in the same way, and allow quick indentification.  Artwork is also skillfully selected for the packages.  The box set to keep it in is alright, but it might have been cool to get a book or insert with it......All in all, I would just like  to say.....WATCH BERSERK.

694099,A2RDR5G65D9H84,B0000639EP,Sebastian Fernandez,"[3, 3]","This is my first real exposure to anime. The only other time I watched some of it was in Tarantino's &quot;Kill Bill: Volume 1&quot;, but it is only in a few passages in the movie that anime is used. Since I enjoy epic fantasy, I thought a good way to start out in anime was in a series that used this genre. I found that I enjoyed the first five episodes of &quot;Berserk&quot;, and even though at some points I found myself having trouble figuring out where the story was going, I was left looking forward to the next disc in the series.In the first episode, the Black Swordsman arrives in a town looking for a monster that has the habitants under his grip, living in a world of fear and misery. The Black Swordsman carries along a huge sword that is bigger than him, he is branded in one of his shoulders and is visited in his dreams by demons that claim to own him. At this point there is no clear plot in the story, but in the next four episodes the story goes back to our hero's youth and the viewer finds out that his name is Guts and he honors this name to the extreme. Guts meets with the Band of the Hawk, which is lead by Griffith, an effeminate but very skillful warrior. After some initial quarrels Guts joins the band of mercenaries and an interesting relationship develops between him, Griffith and Caska, who was until that moment the right hand of Griffith and apparently is in love with him. In episodes two through five there are three main points of interest intertwined in the story: the relationship between Guts and the other Band of Hawk members; the missions in which the band embarks gaining fame and respect; and the glimpses at Guts childhood, which helps the audience to make sense of some of his actions and attitudes.The series starts out a little slow, but through the episodes, it captures the viewers' attention and one starts to sympathize with the main character.

694100,A3A1NTONWQ1SP7,B0000639EP,Sylvantha,"[4, 4]","To appreciate Berserk, I think it is necessary to understand that it is based on an on-going comic series in Japan.  In Japan, each ""chapter"" of any comic is published in numerous weekly or bi-weekly comic magazines, each geared to a certain audience.  It will come no surprise to any reader of the comic that Berserk is published in a bi-weekly comic magazine called ""Young Animal"".  Young Animal is largely an adult oriented (as in nudity & sex) comic magazine and therefore you have to realize that Berserk was never intended to for an young audience.  Trust me when I say that the anime does not even come close to portraying the graphic sex and violence that can be found in the actual comic.However, Berserk is not a comic carried by either sex or violence but rather the depth of its story.  Berserk is about the tale of the protaganist, Guts, living in a period of times that can only be equated to mideval England.  There are no guns (but there is gunpowder) and largely there is supposed to be no magic, e.g. fairies, dragons and such.  The story revolves around the growth and adventures of Guts, providing deep insight and detail from the time of his birth, his life as a mercenary, all the way to his fateful meeting with Gryphus and Gryphus ultimate betrayal of Guts (this is not a spoiler).To compare this animation to the Record of Lodoss Wars would be a mistake as this is a far darker anime.  This is a dark fantasy with a slight romance.  Themes of homosexuality, rape and violence permeate the comic and to a lesser extent the animation.  However, these themes are not used to to shock or carry the story but are actually worked in quite seamlessly.My first criticism against the anime is that it does not go all the way in capturing the dark feel of the comic.  Of course, even though it was a ""midnight"" anime, that can only be expected.My second criticism is pretty much along those lines in that the series ends prematurel but that probably could not also be helped.Overally, I would recommend this animation for a more mature audience as the story line is truly gripping and Guts is simply a ""cool"" protoganist.  However, for those who have the option, I would recommend reading the comic book even before.",4,Captures the darker side of anime but....,1030406400,"08 27, 2002",2002,2231,"['appreciate', 'Berserk', 'think', 'necessary', 'understand', 'based', 'on-going', 'comic', 'series', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'chapter', 'comic', 'published', 'numerous', 'weekly', 'bi-weekly', 'comic', 'magazines', 'geared', 'certain', 'audience', 'will', 'come', 'surprise', 'reader', 'comic', 'Berserk', 'published', 'bi-weekly', 'comic', 'magazine', 'called', 'Young', 'Animal', 'Young', 'Animal', 'largely', 'adult', 'oriented', 'nudity', 'sex', 'comic', 'magazine', 'therefore', 'have', 'realize', 'Berserk', 'was', 'never', 'intended', 'young', 'audience', 'Trust', 'when', 'say', 'anime', 'not', 'even', 'come', 'close', 'portraying', 'graphic', 'sex', 'violence', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'actual', 'comic.However', 'Berserk', 'not', 'comic', 'carried', 'sex', 'violence', 'rather', 'depth', 'story', 'Berserk', 'tale', 'protaganist', 'Guts', 'living', 'period', 'times', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'equated', 'mideval', 'England', 'are', 'guns', 'gunpowder', 'largely', 'supposed', 'be', 'magic', 'e.g', 'fairies', 'dragons', 'such', 'story', 'growth', 'adventures', 'Guts', 'providing', 'deep', 'insight', 'detail', 'time', 'birth', 'life', 'mercenary', 'way', 'fateful', 'meeting', 'Gryphus', 'Gryphus', 'ultimate', 'betrayal', 'Guts', 'not', 'spoiler', 'compare', 'animation', 'Record', 'Lodoss', 'Wars', 'would', 'be', 'mistake', 'far', 'darker', 'anime', 'dark', 'fantasy', 'slight', 'romance', 'Themes', 'homosexuality', 'rape', 'violence', 'permeate', 'comic', 'lesser', 'extent', 'animation', 'However', 'themes', 'are', 'not', 'used', 'shock', 'carry', 'story', 'are', 'actually', 'worked', 'quite', 'seamlessly.My', 'first', 'criticism', 'anime', 'not', 'go', 'way', 'capturing', 'dark', 'feel', 'comic', 'course', 'even', 'was', 'midnight', 'anime', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'expected.My', 'second', 'criticism', 'pretty', 'much', 'lines', 'series', 'prematurel', 'probably', 'could', 'not', 'also', 'be', 'helped.Overally', 'would', 'recommend', 'animation', 'more', 'mature', 'audience', 'story', 'line', 'truly', 'gripping', 'Guts', 'simply', 'cool', 'protoganist', 'However', 'who', 'have', 'option', 'would', 'recommend', 'reading', 'comic', 'book', 'even', 'before']","Berserk: War Cry, Vol. 1"

Mastrolilli ""....""","[2, 6]","Before you Berserk fanatics start complaining about the score, let me just say that Berserk really is a wonderfull anime, and one of the best series of all time. The show includes a surprisingly rich story, which is also quite dark for a TV show. Unfortunately, after watching an imported DVD set, it seems that the series' producers spent more resources than necessary on the first episodes, and didn't quite realize that the story needed to fit in a single TV season.The reason I say that is because they left a HUGE gap in the storyline. The story does reach an ending, but some very important pieces of the storyline were skipped.A series with such high production values should not have this sort of problem. Thankfully the manga includes what was left out. In fact, I hope that someone picks up the manga and decides to continue producing this wonderful series. A story this good deserves a more complete series.",3,The show just seems unfinished,1016668800,"03 21, 2002",2002,918,"['Berserk', 'fanatics', 'start', 'complaining', 'score', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'Berserk', 'really', 'wonderfull', 'anime', 'one', 'best', 'series', 'time', 'show', 'surprisingly', 'rich', 'story', 'also', 'quite', 'dark', 'TV', 'show', 'Unfortunately', 'watching', 'imported', 'DVD', 'set', 'series', 'producers', 'spent', 'more', 'resources', 'necessary', 'first', 'episodes', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'realize', 'story', 'needed', 'fit', 'single', 'TV', 'season.The', 'reason', 'say', 'left', 'HUGE', 'gap', 'storyline', 'story', 'reach', 'ending', 'very', 'important', 'pieces', 'storyline', 'were', 'skipped.A', 'series', 'such', 'high', 'production', 'values', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'sort', 'problem', 'Thankfully', 'manga', 'what', 'was', 'left', 'out', 'fact', 'hope', 'someone', 'up', 'manga', 'continue', 'producing', 'wonderful', 'series', 'A', 'story', 'good', 'more', 'complete', 'series']","Berserk: War Cry, Vol. 1"
