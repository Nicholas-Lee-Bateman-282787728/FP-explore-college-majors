In this case the trailer really sold me on this one and really let me down. It was far from what I expected. Costner really slept walked through his one. Not only was the film predictable but it was flat out boring!

1204477,A1DRKVXO300RUE,B001ILFUBE,Amazon Customer,"[4, 6]","First off, the movie was 2 hours long, at least 30 minutes longer than it needed to be.  Quite a bit of filler nonsense that didn't add value.  That notwithstanding, it was a cute movie, and somewhat heartwarming.  The eventual connection of real american issues to the campaign race was a salient reminder of the disconnect between average american issues and the things that CNN and foxnews choose to focus on.  To that point, it was an interesting, albeit slightly subtle, satire on american media, and the absolute absurd extent to which its mandate for factual news reporting has been so sadly clouded by its corporate profiteering motives. There was a good commentary about personal redemption too.  As the candidates attempted to woo Costner, they eventually questioned their own motives.  Further, Costner did as well.  Together, they all came to realizations that emphasized the need to be true to oneself.  That's a good message, and one often lost in our sardonic society. Overall though, again, the acting was decent (c'mon, Costner is a guilty pleasure and its ok), high production values, decent (albeit wholly predictable) story line, etc.  Worth a rental, just be prepared to fast forward through the ennui.",3,"Predictable, but somewhat heartwarming",1255046400,"10 9, 2009",2009,1223,"['First', 'off', 'movie', 'was', '2', 'hours', 'long', 'least', '30', 'minutes', 'longer', 'needed', 'be', 'bit', 'filler', 'nonsense', 'did', ""n't"", 'add', 'value', 'notwithstanding', 'was', 'cute', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'heartwarming', 'eventual', 'connection', 'real', 'american', 'issues', 'campaign', 'race', 'was', 'salient', 'reminder', 'disconnect', 'average', 'american', 'issues', 'things', 'CNN', 'foxnews', 'choose', 'focus', 'point', 'was', 'interesting', 'albeit', 'slightly', 'subtle', 'satire', 'american', 'media', 'absolute', 'absurd', 'extent', 'mandate', 'factual', 'news', 'reporting', 'been', 'so', 'sadly', 'clouded', 'corporate', 'profiteering', 'motives', 'was', 'good', 'commentary', 'personal', 'redemption', 'too', 'candidates', 'attempted', 'woo', 'Costner', 'eventually', 'questioned', 'own', 'motives', 'Further', 'Costner', 'did', 'as', 'well', 'Together', 'came', 'realizations', 'emphasized', 'need', 'be', 'true', 'oneself', 'good', 'message', 'one', 'often', 'lost', 'sardonic', 'society', 'Overall', 'again', 'acting', 'was', 'decent', ""c'mon"", 'Costner', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'ok', 'high', 'production', 'values', 'decent', 'wholly', 'predictable', 'story', 'line', 'etc', 'rental', 'just', 'be', 'prepared', 'fast', 'forward', 'ennui']",N/A

1204479,A25HYPL2XKQPZB,B001ILFUBE,Bill Garrison,"[0, 2]","Kevin Costner stars as Bud Johnson in the political comedy Swing Vote. Bud is a drunk, recently fired factory worker caring for his young daughter Molly (Madelline Carroll). Molly is a star student and really excited about the upcoming election. She also takes care of Bud. You can see the disappointment on her face as her father lets her down time and time again. Through a freak mishap with a voting machine, Bud's vote on election day is not counted. The state of New Mexico becomes the deciding state in the election, and New Mexico is tied, meaning Bud's vote will decide the national election.Both candidates and political parties converge on New Mexico in an attempt to sway Bud. The majority of the movie focuses on the Republican President played by Kelsey Grammar and his challenger played by Dennis Hopper trying to convince Bud to vote for them.I was wary of watching this movie. Would liberal Hollywood make a pro democrat movie, or would they bumble it up and try and portray a conservative message they don't really understand. Thankfully they do neither. Both candidates hare shown to have flaws, but also to be worthy of the office. The best part of the movie is when Bud is believed to be pro gay marriage and against abortion, so you have the Republican making a pro gay marriage commercial and the democrat making a pro life commercial that are both quite funny (and the pro life commercial is also quite powerful in a comical way.) As I conservative Republican, the politics didn't offend me, and I doubt liberal democrats will be offended either.So, since the politics didn't ruin the movie, was the rest of it any good? This is Kevin Costner's movie. The movie revolves around Bud's clueless drunkeness. Coster is still a good actor and funny enough to carry the movie even though it drags at times in its two hour running time.Swing Vote is a good, harmless Saturday night movie rental.

The script seemed like it was written by a junior high civics student - and one with a barely passing grade at that. And it was boringly trite.The story is about a Presidential election, through unbelievable circumstances, coming down to one man.  That man is the ignorant, drunk, trailer trash Bud Johnson, played by Kevin Costner.  Once the election comes down to one man, the movie is supposed to be a satire on the overzealous media and political consultants pulling out all their dirty tricks to win the vote of Bud, and the election.This movie is not funny.  It does not work well as satire because the caricatures made of the main protagonists are simply too unbelievable.  And the message of not letting your morality and principles become dictated by the hunger to win an election or ambition is totally lost in this mess of a movie.The only comical aspect of this movie is I found myself wondering what would happen if instead of using a drunk, white, trailer trash dad with a drug addicted ex-wife, they had chosen to create and equally offensive caricature of inner city African American using the same basic character traits.  First, the movie wouldn't even be made.  And secondly, if it were, there would be riots and the same people who made this crappy movie would be in the front lines of the protestors.

Not nice.Here he does nice  very wellAnd here is something new for me, too, something I never have seen and so I could not recognize him until well into the film and even then I was not certain.We have Costner playing nice, and relaxed, and normal, even.Normally we see him intense, driven, stern, focussed, obsessed. Not a barrel of laughs, whether inRobin Hood - Prince of Thieves (Two-Disc Special Extended Edition)orJFK - Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition)or inDances with Wolves (20th Anniversary Edition) [Blu-ray] or anything else you got. Stern. Knitted brows. Real serious.Here he lays back and acts normal.The product page reviews here on amazon always get it wrong. IF he was acting anymore natural here they could stamp him organic and call it a day.I guess, like inThe Great Dictator (2 Disc Special Edition), he doesn't drag out the serious stuff until a speechifying at the end.There is a lot to love in this movie.For one thing, they pretty much manage to keep a lid on Nathan Lane and get him to hang out and act natural for awhile.

The invulnerability of  the election process was well documented and ""SWING VOTE"" takes things one step further, what if one man had to decide the outcome of the US Presidency.  All to one vote?""SWING VOTE"" takes place in the small town of Texico, New Mexico.  A small town where unemployment is high, people are losing their jobs due to insourcing (in this case, Mexican workers replacing American workers in the factory jobs) and focusing on a single father named Bud (Costner) and his daughter Molly (Carroll).Bud has lived his life carefree and always drinking beer and in a mess.  His daughter is the opposite.  She's smart, she's has kept up with current affairs in the world and she tries to take care of her father.  They live in a trailer park home and Bud, he just likes to fish and drink and be with his daughter.  Molly is featured on television after a news crew visits her school to film the children giving their speeches on the importance of voting.Molly who is aware of her father and her county's social low income situation wants her dad to vote for a candidate that best represents the poor.  With the elections coming up that day, she has her father promise to vote in the elections.  Bud agrees.  But with Bud losing his job at an egg processing plant due to being late at work and drinking on the job,  he goes to a bar and gets in a drunk stupor and hits his head in a ""Vote today"" sign and passes out inside his truck.  He essentially breaks his promise to Molly.Molly who is disappointed with her father sneaks into a voting poll station where one of the vets is dead asleep.  She forges his signature in the registered voters booklet and puts her voting application in the digital machine and while she is about to vote for the presidency for her father, the cleaning lady accidentally disconnects the plug to the voting area.  Quickly feeling that she may get caught, Molly tears the stub and goes to her father.All of a sudden, news starts to swirl about the close election between Republican President Andrew Boone (Grammer) and Democrat Donald Greeneleaf (Hopper).  They both are tied and whoever wins the state of New Mexico will get the electoral votes needed to win the election.  The state government's election officer and State Attorney comes to Bud Johnson's home questioning him if he voted and knowing that his daughter did something, he goes along with it. The machine that he voted in, did not count his vote and thus he needs to recast the vote.  He is told to keep quiet about it.A local reporter named Kate Madison (Patton) who followed the government officials knows something is up with the close elections and the residents of the trailer park.  Kate reports back to her boss John Sweeney (George Lopez) at the news station that she has figured out what has gone on with the elections and that the single vote that can determine the president is Bud.  Both individuals feel that this story can elevate their careers nationally and thus, Kate becomes the head anchor at the news and responsible for getting the exclusives with Bud.Kate eventually gets the exclusive interview with Bud and outs him to the world that his vote will determine the presidency.  All of a sudden, ever news outlet is in Texico, New Mexico parked in front of his mobile home.  The President and the Democrat nominee for President start doing their research and make Texico their home for the next 10 days for their campaign and doing all they can do to win Bud's vote.Bud doesn't know anything about politics or what's happening in the world but his daughter tries her best to help him.  Each time a show interviews him and shows what he may be interested in, may it be fishing, insourcing or not caring about gay rights, both campaigns adjusts itself to win Bud's vote.But throughout the process, both politicians are looking incredibly stupid in switching their political views for one man with the conservative President Boone now campaigning for liberal rights such as protecting the lake that Bud fishes in for environmental reasons, supporting gay rights, etc.  and for liberal Democrat Greenleaf, his campaigns now switching to conservative trying to prevent illegal aliens in order to get the swing vote.President Boone's campaign advisor Martin Fox (Tucci) goes so far by having NASCAR Richard Petty go to the home of the Johnson's and entice him to drive his car to Air Force One for a meeting.  While Greenleaf's campaign advisor Art Crumb (Lane) has a party with all of Bud's favorite food and even had a major commercial with Willie Nelson (Bud's favorite performer) asking Bud to support his friend Greenleaf.""SWING VOTE"" pokes fun at the Presidential elections and how far a candidate would go to win.  The film is in essence a comedy but there are serious moments when Bud realizes that he just likes the attention he's getting and ignoring the issues that people care about.  In fact, Molly has been so busy trying to make her father look good, she's been answering those who have written to her father and noticing that her father hardly has time for her and that he's becoming something that she doesn't approve of.Meanwhile, the President and Greenleaf can't believe how they have strayed from their own political views and have let down the people who have supported them.  What makes ""SWING VOTE"" truly work is Costner able to fit into the role of Bud so perfectly.  The mannerisms and the style, Costner does a great job.  But the star who shined is the young Madeline Carroll as Molly Johnson.  For her first film, she hits a home run with her performance.  From the comedy to the tearful, emotional scenes...she was perfect.And the same goes to Kelsey Grammer as President Boone and Hopper as Greenleaf and a lot of talent in this film.  But to make things even more realistic, was the fact that the key figures that we have watched in the news or on television reporting on the elections such as Campbell Brown, Tucker Carlson, James Carville, Ariana Huffington, Aaron Brown, Larry King, Bill Maher and even Entertainment Tonight's Mary Hart and many more took part in this film to make the whole political atmosphere seem realistic.  But most of all, the many people who came out for the live debates or those who participated in the film (as the budget couldn't afford thousands of people to bein the film,  thus the director and Kevin Costner had contests and Costner performed live in order for people to come out and they got thousands of participants) and made the film much more realistic.I was quite pleased with the film and even moreso, on Blu-ray!VIDEO & AUDIO:""SWING VOTE"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1).  The colors are vibrant and the location of being in New Mexico, with the hills, the clouds and everything seemed to work in capturing the beauty of that state.  The Blu-ray brought out the characters and of course, for those Blu-ray fans who go crazy over skin pores and wrinkles and such, this film really captures it well.  I was very pleased with the cinematography and the overall quality in Blu-ray.  Absolutely beautiful to watch!As for the audio, audio is presented in English 5.1 DTS (48 khz/24-bit) and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  I can tell you that from the opening menu and throughout the film, music plays a big role in the film and really comes alive on your front speakers.  Of course, the film is a dialogue-based film but you do get a sense of surround with crowd noises and such.SPECIAL FEATURES:""SWING VOTE"" comes with several special features:* Inside the Campaign: The Politics of Production is a 13-minute featurette that goes into how certain scenes were made and working with the talent on the film.  Interviews with the talent.* Deleted & Extended Scenes (with optional Director's Commentary) features certain scenes that were cut due to pacing.  Overall good choices on the cuts.* Audio Commentary by Writer/Director Joshua Michael Stern and writer Jason Richman is a very informative commentary about working with the cast especially in key moments such as Molly's emotional scenes and how it wasn't difficult to direct her.  They asked her what they need and she delivered which was very rare for a child actor.  Also, during the Presidential debates of how they were able to get thousands of people who were willing to be part of the film (they didn't have the budget to pay thousands of people) by having contests and Kevin Costner performing live (note: Costner and his band Modern West performs live on this film).  Also, how they found certain areas to film and how sometimes there were freak storms that had to be fixed in post production or reshot.""SWING VOTE"" is deifnitely a comedy that I enjoyed from beginning to end.  There are so much talent in this film, especially for the news talent who cover politics to be involved in this film made things a bit more realistic.  Costner as Bud Johnson is literally a guy that some look at as a guy who wasted his life, always drunk and he fit the role perfectly.  Madeline Carroll, is definitely a young actress who truly shined and Kelsey Grammer does a remarkable job.  I know for some, Dennis Hopper as a good guy, Democrat may feel it's a bit unusual due to his villain roles in the past but he does well.Of course, with a satire on the political process, there has to be missteps with ""SWING VOTE"" right?  There are a few things that may raise some eyebrows, not necessarily in a good way.  There are a lot of corporate branding in this film.  Those who despite any corporate product placement or name dropping in a film, may have problems with that on this film.Another is the hilarious commercials that are targeted to Bud.  Of course, some may wonder why would a candidate waste millions of dollars on their campaigns on television ads just for Bud?  Perhaps this takes the political satire too far for some.And of course, for a lighthearted comedy, you get a serious moment in the film in which Molly who is disenchanted with her father visits her mother that she has never seen but she's all drugged out and wants nothing to do with her.  A really good performance by Mare Winningham and a serious scene but for some, it may seem out of place for a comedy.  [note: the Director's commentary goes into why the scene was included].But there are some key moments that I was touched.  This small town of Texico and seeing how others in Molly's class were not fortunate as well, many have parents unemployed and really hurting financially.  As smart and intelligent Molly may be, the strain that she takes on because her father's inability to take control of his life and all of America's eyes are on this family becomes to hard for her to bare.  There are a good number of touching moments throughout the film and you hope that Bud and even the politicians will find some redemption.But all in all, the fact is that films that revolve around politics, especially in today's depressing economic times can really put people off.  When this film was released in the theaters, America's presidential elections were so in-your-face, televised and covered/parodied to the extreme and there were those who were so serious minded about the candidates and those who were just put off of hearing about politics all the time, I don't even know if this film had a chance in such circumstances.Fast forward to a new year and now we have the film out on Blu-ray.  All I can say is that ""SWING VOTE"" is one of those films that depends on one's state of mind.  If you are disenchanted by the political system and want to stray far away from it, then this film is not going to win you over.  Personally, I was really impressed by Costner and Carroll who really delivered in their roles and supported by a cast that also did a great job.  I was entertained and enjoyed the film from beginning to end and sure, the film was a bit contrived especially on how it pokes fun at major political issues and such but the tensions I personally had of the US Presidential elections before November, at the time when this film came out in theaters, and now watching it months after the elections is now gone.  It was great to watch this film and not think of what kind of important message it would have or if it would influence America.  I just enjoyed the film for what it is, laughed and had a good time.""SWING VOTE"" may not be for everyone but if you are looking for a comedy that is enjoyable and possibly inspiring for some, definitely give it a try!",4,"he picture quality of the film on Blu-ray is  wonderful!

1204485,A23XVF23C7BHP0,B001ILFUBE,"D. M. Farmbrough ""Dave Farmbrough""","[2, 3]","I was impressed by Kevin Costner here. For this slightly seedy part, he has grown facial hair that makes him look like Ian Botham in his Shredded Wheat advert days, and he does a strange voice throughout the film. These affectations aside, he turns in a good performance as an alcoholic single father doing his best - and well, sometimes not his best, to bring up his daughter alone. His overachieving twelve year-old daughter is sympathetically played by Madeline Carroll, who keeps her part just on the right side of Lisa Simpson.The story is partly about the family and partly about the absurdity of the democratic system as highlighted in the 2000 US Presidential election. In this film, the premise is that everyone else has voted, and only 'Bud' (Costner's character) needs to cast his vote to decide who becomes the next president of the U.S.A. The ensuing circus as he is courted by Democrat and Republican candidates and their spin doctors is a microcosm of the genuine battle for votes we are seeing played out today. There are good comic performances from Kelsey Grammer (TV's Frasier, here looking more like Bob Hope than ever) and by Dennis Hopper as the two party leaders.I won't spoil the ending, but it is notable that even though the film pulls no punches in portraying the spin doctors as greedy, opportunist, and cynical, the Presidential Candidates are given a rather idealistic treatment. They come across as genuine people who have somehow been caught up in a party machine that is bigger than them, yet regain their integrity in the end.It's an entertaining movie, and worth watching for a slew of strong performances.

Bush as President of the United States.  Now, imagine that instead of one state, the country's fate depends on the vote of one man.  Highly unlikely it may seem, which is why it's the basis for a movie.  That movie is ""Swing Vote.""That one man is Bud Johnson (Kevin Costner), a big time drinker and recently unemployed.  He really doesn't think too much about politics, but is smart and overly patriotic daughter Molly (Madeline Carroll) is very much into politics, especially the presidential race.  Her patriotism and political concern pay off as she convinces her father to perform his civic duty.  Due to a series of rather unfortunate events and a voting booth ""malfunction"" Bud's vote does not count leaving the presidential race in a tie, which attracts the attention of the media and the candidates.""Swing Vote"" does involve some serious issues; illegal immigration and unemployment just to name a couple, and it also brings up a serious theme, that every vote counts, but it does have its funny moments.  Some campaign ads that are put together to entice our sole voter come to mind.  The performances from Carroll and Costner were both very true to life.  Costner as the boozing, unemployed single parent struggling to make ends meet and Carroll as the young daughter with too much weight on her shoulders.A good movie is one that moves you, disturbs you or makes you think.

1204489,A1LNH5Z5IRSGM6,B001ILFUBE,Gayle Tiller,"[1, 2]","Kevin Costner is absolutely hilarious in his role as Bud Johnson who is a broke, beer guzzling single dad living in a trailer with his daughter in an obscure town in New Mexico. Bud could care less about America's political system, because he's too afraid if he votes he'll be forced to be a juror.Enter his 12 year old daughter Molly superbly played by Madeline Carroll. Molly has ambition, drive and talent that her father lacks. Her dream is to be either a veterinarian or the Chair of the Federal Reserve. She totally believes in the political system. In fact, she registers her dad to vote. Molly has been assigned a school project in which the kids are required to report about their parents' experiences with voting. Bud scoffs at the idea. However, he later reluctantly promises to vote.On the day of the election, Bud is fired from his job. He self-medicates himself with alcohol and falls into a drunken stupor. So he never makes it to the polls. Because Molly really wants to write about voting, she decides to vote for her father. She tries to cast a vote but somehow it doesn't go through. Then through a bizarre set of circumstances, the fate of the presidential election falls into Bud's hands. His single vote will determine the next president.The movie is absolutely hilarious. Political junkies will enjoy the flip flops of the candidates as they vie for Bud's vote. Some of the scenes were politically incorrect and at times unrealistic.

Your first instinct is to think it's a movie about two presidential candidates whose very fate for the presidency is determined on the swing voter of a disinterested red neck.In fact, that's how the movie starts off, and Kevin Costner plays that role to hilt but authentically, but as the movie goes on and you get past the initial base plot, the movie starts bringing out some emotional scenes, and some of those scenes are downright tearjerkers.I expected this movie to be zany in a mad, mad, mad world fashion, but it didn't turn out that way at all.  The writers did something different, fresh, heartwarming, emotional, funny and winsome with the movie.  So I have to give it an A+.It was kind of nice to see Kevin Costner outside of his usual hero role, but that sense of Americana charm carried the film, even as a disinterested, dead beat dad hick. It had a redeeming quality to it, and he played the role well.Madeline Carroll, who plays his daughter, is absolutely phenomenal.

That is truly a shame because this film had great potential to be something greater as both a commentary on our political system and a have great entertainment value as well as is evidenced by the trailer. By the looks of the trailer it looked like it was going to be a good light hearted engrossing film. However, it seems that the central idea of this movie never came to fruition. Perhaps the editing is to blame. That was my initial thought. But a glaring negative factor is Costner's character and his performance as well.

1204496,A1VOPP2OFITP7D,B001ILFUBE,June Bug,"[0, 1]","I am torn between disliking this movie and being downright angry.  In many ways, this is propaganda.  The premise is that it is attacking political campaigns but in actuality it is an insult to viewers by mocking us as well.The movie script was to long and to loose. The daughter has two terrible parents and surprisingly is living with the better parent (a lazy, swearing, narcissistic alcoholic).  He claims that he was ""insourced"" and thus unemployed, but that's a lie.  Though most of his factory co-workers have been replaced by Mexicans, ""because management believes they work harder and for less money"", he and his friends have been laid off.  Yet, we see a scene where Bud is actually fired by his friend and Hispanic boss because he missed 31 days of work in the past year, is perpetually late and is caught drinking beer on the job and while doing so he destroys a pallet of inventory.  So, in this case management is right!Bud lies repeatedly throughout the movie, reinforcing that he is a lazy bum.  Since he represents Americans, then one of the underlying themes is American business truly needs illegals to work in the U.S. because many are just like Bud and his friends (lots of scenes with him in the bar with his unemployed? Native American friends (an insult to Native Americans as well!).Unfortunately, I do not believe this is the case for the many millions of Americans out of work, who if Congress has their way, will soon have to compete with illegal immigrants being legislated as full-fledged citizens and thus have even greater access to jobs and resources.  This is not a partisan issue nor is it racist.  Many people do follow the rules and become citizens by following the rules.  Here in Florida, which is much like NYC, CA and border states, we have many illegals and many legitimate immigrants (those from the Caribbean, Africa, China, India and South America are angry that they had to follow the rules to become U.S. citizens). I talk to them, many are my friends. Thus I found this bogus and this movie reinforces this propaganda.Another source of propaganda is that our votes count.  If that were true, electoral college would have been eliminated many years ago. Look at the 2000 election as proof, the Supreme Court decided when in actually, the U.S. Congress by way of the Constitution should have decided.  Also, for more than 12 years people have been wanting a receipt of their vote. Diebold makes ATM machines with a print out but they claim they can't for their voting machines, and now 13 years later they still haven't figured it out?  We can store incredible amounts of information on drop of water (cloud memory) but voters can't get a receipt?  All the other voting machines claim the same.  C'mon.Furthermore, it assumes that people running for president, will eventually return to their conscience, really?  There have been scandals in every administration for the last 20 years probably the last 200; regardless of party, someone gets blamed, the Presidents don't apologize.  The Two Politicians lie throughout the movie until the end, where Bud and the wife of the other candidate makes them question their motives.Finally, the one funny scene has Dennis Hopper the challenger turning from Pro-Choice to Pro-Life to get Bud's vote. His tv ad has children on the playground disappear in puffs of colored smoke as he talks.  It was then that I realized I saw this movie once before 1 1/4 hr into the movie!  That is how memorable it is...It is sad that Hollywood and politicians thinks so little of Americans!  Are there people like Bud, sure.  However, it is the media, politicians and Hollywood, who have intentionally created an uninformed populace by focusing on trauma and drama instead of covering real news.  I found this movie to be mocking us as citizens.

Elections are no longer about the people deciding their future leaders (assuming it ever was) but when we are divided the most with mud slinging, personal attacks, and silencing differing opinions by any means necessary.  Course, this is nothing new but there is a point when a person needs to say ""enough.""Enter Swing Vote (SV).SV is the story of an absolute slob ""Bud,"" (Costner) who, by no means, should be allowed to decide anything of any importance.  Bud can't keep a steady job, remember anything about his daughter, is apathetic to those around him, and is generally the very definition of a loser.  By a string of weird coincidences, and a voting machine mishap, he vote will ultimately be the one deciding the president of the United States.The rest of the film follows the two presidential candidates doing positively everything they can to win one vote from getting celebrities to endorse them to betraying their own principles, which is the crux of the message behind SV.  I won't give away any more, but the moral of the story is that in our quest for power to do good, we ultimately became what we despise in what is nothing more than a political game.SV portrays both sides, republicans and democrats, fairly evenly although there were far too many liberal television pundits and could've used some balance from the other side.  However, both candidates were portrayed by staunch republicans Kelsey Grammer and Dennis Hopper so I guess you give and take.The acting was done fairly well.  Who better to play a slob than a slob (Costner)?  It's like getting Robert Downey Jr. to play a drunken superhero (Iron Man).  Grammer and Hopper did a great job playing phony political drones trying to appease one man for power while Nathan Lane was a great down-and-out campaign manager.  It was a stellar cast.What struck me as odd was the benevolent nature of Bud's daughter, who seemed to run the house (er... trailer), rescue Bud from the bar, and have a much more intelligent view on the world than even the candidates.  While I've known such people growing up, they typically arose from very supportive families and not on their own so I'm wondering, like many other reviewers, how the hell did this girl get so good in such a dump?  Whatever cereal she eats, send every politician a case.Now, many reviewers have said the jokes were bland and I have to respectfully disagree.  I thought the awkwardness jokes of a simpleton being pampered by the largest candidates was hilarious since they are doing what they normally do but on a MUCH smaller scale.

Once pass that you find that the movie is too long by at least 15 minutes.  Costner is not a very likeable person and is somewhat of an a__hole.  His final speech at the debate is moving but doesn't make up for his grosse behavior.  The scene about the ex-wife feels tossing in and is not developed.  The black boy who the girl likes is memntioned but never developed and the scene when we see his father again feels like there were some scenes left out.  The girl is cute and too smart for her age.  Lopez is wasted in a part that could have been played by anyone. Hopper comes across as a wimp and the scene where he gets slapped is uncomfortable.  Lane and Tucci are the best part of the film.  They are polished and believeable. Grammer towards the end of the film surprised me.  The scenes with Coster in the lawn chair and the late night talk with Tucci are moving and lead me to believe that Grammer could be a good serious actor.All in all this is an okay film and is forgetable.

Both of the stars do their best to make this story interesting, but this political satire on one vote counting, just cannot get the ""edge"" and  washes into sappy sentiment.The movie's jokes fall flat, Costner plays a red neck, beer-drinking loser that has a lovable precocious daughter, Molly.

Costner does what he can with the part, but it just did not ring true.  His sudden turn-around at the end of the movie was also unbelievable and pure Hollywood.The Republican running for President was played by Kelsey Grammer and the Democrat was played by Dennis Hopper.

Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[0, 0]","I've seen reviews comparing Swing Vote to the optimistic films of Frank Capra, a la ""Mr. Smith Goes To Washington"", and those comparisons are valid.Kevin Costner is not a bad actor, but boy-oh-boy he's not above making a stinker of a movie.  (I have been in many discussions with other film-lovers who tend to divide Costner's work into ""Pre Dances With Wolves"" and after, with a resume that becomes populated by ""Waterworld"" and ""The Postman"".  This is a gross oversimplification of an impressive career with a directing Academy Award and includes impressive ""Post-Dances"" films such as JFK and the recent Mr. Brooks.)Costner's character is a not-quite-lovable loser named Bud Johnson.  (Budweiser accomplishes some of the least-subtle product placement in film history with the beer-drinking lead character with, coincidentally, the same name as the nickname of their product.)  Bud is a single parent, and a very bad one.  We meet Mom in a scene late in the film, and Mare Winningham makes us understand why someone like Bud would have custody of Molly in the first place.  She almost makes Bud sympathetic, but it doesn't excuse Bud's drinking, indifferent parenting, poor job performance, or the series of ""dancers"" he's brought home to Molly.Molly is in that no-man's land of pre-puberty, but she is smart and committed and compassionate in a way that would shame both of her parents if they had a responsible bone in their bodies.  She is also played by Madeline Carroll with a performance that makes her easily the star of the movie.Watching the movie I couldn't help but imagine different actors in these roles: Dakota Fanning comes to mind for Molly, but I frankly can't imagine a performance in this role that could exceed Miss Carroll's.  I could EASILY imagine Giovani Ribisi giving a funnier, more nuanced and more believable performance as Bud.You've probably seen or read enough to understand that a voting glitch makes an entire Presidential election hang on the vote of: Bud.  Understandably, when the New Mexico Officials arrive to tell Bud that his vote wasn't counted, Bud thinks they've come to take Molly away.The Republican candidate, the incumbent President played by Kelsey Grammar and the Democratic candidate, played by Dennis Hopper, descend on Texico, New Mexico to court Bud's re-vote.  They're represented by campaign managers Stanley Tucci for the GOP and Nathan Lane for the Dems.  To receive the one and only vote that will decide the election, the Republicans make television ads embracing homosexual marriage and the Democrats coming down hard on immigrants, all on off-hand comments made by Bud to the buzzard journalists that start circling his double-wide.Paula Patton is quite good as a local journalist who first breaks the story of the lone swing voter.  She's the one who understands that Molly is the brains at the Johnson household, but she also makes a decision of journalist ethics that allows the remainder of the story to take place. George Lopez is unfortunately wasted as the news director at her station.I agree with other reviewers who lament that this film could have been more - but it's acceptable as is.",4,A Film that challenges us to question the process,1238976000,"04 6, 2009",2009,3161,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'reviews', 'comparing', 'Swing', 'Vote', 'optimistic', 'films', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'la', 'Mr.', 'Smith', 'Goes', 'Washington', 'comparisons', 'are', 'valid.Kevin', 'Costner', 'not', 'bad', 'actor', 'boy-oh-boy', 'not', 'making', 'stinker', 'movie', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'discussions', 'other', 'film-lovers', 'who', 'tend', 'divide', 'Costner', 'work', 'Pre', 'Wolves', 'resume', 'populated', 'Waterworld', 'Postman', 'gross', 'oversimplification', 'impressive', 'career', 'directing', 'Academy', 'Award', 'impressive', 'Post-Dances', 'films', 'such', 'JFK', 'recent', 'Mr', 'Brooks', 'Costner', 'character', 'not-quite-lovable', 'loser', 'named', 'Bud', 'Johnson', 'Budweiser', 'least-subtle', 'product', 'placement', 'film', 'history', 'beer-drinking', 'lead', 'character', 'coincidentally', 'same', 'name', 'nickname', 'product', 'Bud', 'single', 'parent', 'very', 'bad', 'one', 'meet', 'Mom', 'scene', 'late', 'film', 'Mare', 'Winningham', 'understand', 'why', 'someone', 'Bud', 'would', 'have', 'custody', 'Molly', 'first', 'place', 'almost', 'Bud', 'sympathetic', ""n't"", 'excuse', 'Bud', 'drinking', 'indifferent', 'parenting', 'poor', 'job', 'performance', 'series', 'dancers', 'brought', 'home', 'Molly.Molly', 'no-man', 'land', 'pre-puberty', 'smart', 'committed', 'compassionate', 'way', 'would', 'shame', 'parents', 'had', 'responsible', 'bone', 'bodies', 'also', 'played', 'Madeline', 'Carroll', 'performance', 'easily', 'star', 'movie.Watching', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'imagine', 'different', 'actors', 'roles', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'mind', 'Molly', 'frankly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'performance', 'role', 'could', 'exceed', 'Miss', 'Carroll', 'could', 'EASILY', 'imagine', 'Giovani', 'Ribisi', 'giving', 'funnier', 'more', 'nuanced', 'more', 'believable', 'performance', 'Bud.You', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'seen', 'read', 'enough', 'understand', 'voting', 'glitch', 'entire', 'Presidential', 'election', 'hang', 'vote', 'Bud', 'Understandably', 'when', 'New', 'Mexico', 'Officials', 'arrive', 'tell', 'Bud', 'vote', 'was', ""n't"", 'counted', 'Bud', ""'ve"", 'come', 'take', 'Molly', 'away.The', 'Republican', 'candidate', 'incumbent', 'President', 'played', 'Kelsey', 'Grammar', 'Democratic', 'candidate', 'played', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'descend', 'Texico', 'New', 'Mexico', 'court', 'Bud', 're-vote', ""'re"", 'represented', 'campaign', 'managers', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'GOP', 'Nathan', 'Lane', 'Dems', 'receive', 'one', 'only', 'vote', 'will', 'decide', 'election', 'Republicans', 'make', 'television', 'ads', 'embracing', 'homosexual', 'marriage', 'Democrats', 'coming', 'down', 'hard', 'immigrants', 'off-hand', 'comments', 'made', 'Bud', 'buzzard', 'start', 'circling', 'double-wide.Paula', 'Patton', 'quite', 'good', 'local', 'journalist', 'who', 'first', 'story', 'lone', 'swing', 'voter', 'one', 'who', 'Molly', 'brains', 'Johnson', 'household', 'also', 'decision', 'journalist', 'ethics', 'remainder', 'story', 'take', 'place', 'George', 'Lopez', 'unfortunately', 'wasted', 'news', 'director', 'station.I', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'who', 'lament', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'acceptable']",N/A

The idea of having a movie, which showed in movie theatres during one of the most interesting elections in years in the US, all about the importance of voting.  A scenario where the voting is neck and neck and by a (very) peculiar circumstance, it all comes down to one.. swing... voter, in one.. small.. town.  The candidates descend on small town America to woo this voter, and in the process expose the flaws of modern American voting, where candidates will sell their principles just to get the vote.  Satirical, topical, and put in Kevin Costner as Bud, the everyman at the centre of it all, and what could go wrong!Unfortunately, the satirical edge is blunted by a need to not take sides, and an overdose of syrup to keep it family oriented.  Also, for a film marketed as a comedy, it's pretty unfunny.. there are a few fun moments watching Kelsey Grammar and Dennis Hopper as the candidates squirm and dance through hoops for that crucial vote, but frankly, thinking this would spin out to two hours worth of entertainment was a misfire.  Costner is fine, but bear in mind you will be watching him as a (in the movies own words) sub-average American who drinks too much, for almost the entire movie - with just a bit of redemption where he gives that trademark American values speech at the end, before a cop-out ending.  Best things about the movie are a really quite fantastic performance from the young Madeline Carroll as Bud's intelligent and sincere daughter, and the hysterically awful political TV spots the candidates design to cater to Bud.Unfortunately where this could have been fascinating and dark, it turned out frothy and forgettable.",2,"The polls are in, and we don't have a winner...",1253923200,"09 26, 2009",2009,1821,"['Here', 'again', 'peculiar', 'mathematics', 'Hollywood', 'where', 'Great', 'Idea', '+', 'Great', 'Talent', '=', 'mediocre', 'movie', 'face', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'pitch', 'idea', 'having', 'movie', 'showed', 'movie', 'theatres', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'elections', 'years', 'US', 'importance', 'voting', 'scenario', 'where', 'voting', 'neck', 'neck', 'very', 'peculiar', 'circumstance', 'down', 'one..', 'swing', 'voter', 'one..', 'small..', 'town', 'candidates', 'descend', 'small', 'town', 'America', 'woo', 'voter', 'process', 'expose', 'flaws', 'modern', 'American', 'voting', 'where', 'candidates', 'will', 'sell', 'principles', 'just', 'get', 'vote', 'Satirical', 'topical', 'put', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Bud', 'everyman', 'centre', 'what', 'could', 'go', 'wrong', 'Unfortunately', 'satirical', 'edge', 'blunted', 'need', 'not', 'take', 'sides', 'overdose', 'syrup', 'keep', 'family', 'oriented', 'Also', 'film', 'marketed', 'comedy', 'pretty', 'are', 'few', 'fun', 'moments', 'watching', 'Kelsey', 'Grammar', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'candidates', 'squirm', 'dance', 'hoops', 'crucial', 'vote', 'frankly', 'thinking', 'would', 'spin', 'out', 'two', 'hours', 'entertainment', 'was', 'misfire', 'Costner', 'fine', 'bear', 'mind', 'will', 'be', 'watching', 'movies', 'own', 'words', 'sub-average', 'American', 'who', 'too', 'much', 'almost', 'entire', 'movie', 'just', 'bit', 'redemption', 'where', 'trademark', 'American', 'values', 'speech', 'end', 'cop-out', 'ending', 'Best', 'things', 'movie', 'are', 'really', 'quite', 'fantastic', 'performance', 'young', 'Madeline', 'Carroll', 'Bud', 'intelligent', 'sincere', 'daughter', 'hysterically', 'awful', 'political', 'TV', 'spots', 'candidates', 'design', 'cater', 'Bud.Unfortunately', 'where', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'fascinating', 'dark', 'turned', 'out', 'frothy', 'forgettable']",N/A

She's the one who gets him up, does the meals, cleans the house, keeps the budget.All Dad has to do to shine in her eyes is vote in the presidential election.

1204513,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B001ILFUBE,RMurray847,"[3, 6]","SWING VOTE was filmed pretty much entirely in a small town near Albuquerque, New Mexico (where I live), so I was certainly interested in seeing the scenery and any local sites. Unfortunately, except for a couple of lovely scenes on the banks of the Rio Grande (standing in for the Pecos River), there wasn't much of our natural beauty. Lots of action takes place at a trailer park.The rest of movie is equally disappointing overall. But frankly, it isn't surprising. The premise itself sets the viewer up for a bit of a fantasy...one where you have a pretty good idea of what the final scene will be like...and you'll be right. The movie asks us to believe that the entire National Presidential election has come down to one state...New Mexico...and that New Mexico is a dead-tie. And it is further determined that one lone voter in the tiny town of Texico did not have his vote counted because of a voting machine malfunction.That voter happens to be Bud (Kevin Costner), an alcoholic single-father, recently laid off from his job at an egg processing plant. Bud didn't even want to vote, his precocious daughter (Madeline Carroll) has forced the issue because of her own concern about ""civic duty"" and ""giving a voice to the voiceless.""So poor Bud, who just wants to be left to drink himself to sleep each night, is thrust into the national spotlight when his identity is revealed and every news reporter in the world sets up camp outside his aluminum door. He's bewildered at the attention, but left lighted-headed with joy when the two candidates begin to ""suck up"" to him. First, the incumbent president (Kelsey Grammer), brings Bud and his girl to visit Air Force One, then the Democratic contender (Dennis Hopper) arranges a huge party in Bud's honor...one at which Bud himself is encouraged to play with his band, a group of musicians who do nothing but Willie Nelson covers.The two candidates seem to be genuinely likeable guys, which is nice. But their advisors are craven, grasping men. Stanley Tucci is the smooth, heartless Republic operator and Nathan Lane is the flop-sweat ridden Democratic manipulator. Both men encourage their charges to change positions just to sway Bud. After all, this is now a ""one man"" campaign.The most amusing parts of the film show the commercials that the two men make, just for Bud! It's ridiculous that they'd do such a thing, but the commercials are quite funny...particularly the one Dennis Hopper puts out there when he ""changes"" his views from Pro-choice to Pro-Life. We laughed out loud at those bits.Much of the film involves shows us how Bud continually resists taking his task seriously. And this is crushing his serious, intelligent daughter. The movie is REALLY about Bud needing to grow into a responsible father, not a responsible voter. Young Madeline Carroll does an excellent job in her role, even though it's tough to believe that the child of a drunkard like Costner and a drug-addicted mother (Mare Winningham...in a brief, blistering performance that totally doesn't fit the tone of the movie) could turn out this way. But she does a great job.By now, Costner has perfected the ""once handsome man gone to seed"" character (UPSIDE OF ANGER, TIN CUP)...but here he is at his seediest. In fact, he's so booze addled that he comes off as almost mentally challenged. He seems incapable of focusing on anything. (Frankly, it almost seems like Costner is doing his best impersonation of Homer Simpson.) Bud is somewhat charming, but mostly he's frustrating. Will he finally pull himself out of his malaise and take his daughter seriously? What do you think?The movie doesn't take many controversial political stances. It takes gentle jabs at both sides...and honestly, that's okay with me. I didn't need to see a ""fable"" that took sides in the realm of politics. But by the same token, this makes the whole thing seem vaguely sanitized. Some have compared the film to the work of Frank Capra. There is some surface validity to this...but MR. SMITH was never as big of a loser as Bud.The supporting performances are spotty. Grammer and Tucci are both pretty good...Tucci is one of the most interesting supporting actors working today. Hopper and Lane look like amateurs compared to these guys...and frankly, Nathan Lane's shtick is growing a little tiresome. Paula Patton as a news reporter who breaks Bud's identity doesn't manage to rise above her sketchily written part, and George Lopez, as her boss, is shrill, loud, sweaty and utterly miscast and unlikeable. His scenes were clearly filmed at another time and place (he appears with no other significant characters except Patton), and it seems the director forgot what kind of tone the movie was going to have. Finally, I must mention a truly stupid cameo by Richard Petty as himself, who takes Bud on a ride in his racecar to visit Air Force One. He looks terrible, with unconvincingly white teeth and a scary tan. It isn't his fault, I'm sure it seemed like a good idea...but the filmmakers have done him no favors.The film is 120 minutes long, and it is modestly diverting. There are enough laughs to keep it going, and young Carroll has a few genuinely moving moments. Costner has been more charming...but he's still fairly charming here. But you know where this film is going from almost the first moment, and I guarantee you'll be able to call the final scene. And if you foolishly think this film might actually have something important to say about current politics, you'll be sadly disappointed.It's a disposable film. I wouldn't recommend disposing of much of your money to see it.",3,"Has its charms, but mostly quite average.",1225411200,"10 31, 2008",2008,5603,"['SWING', 'VOTE', 'was', 'filmed', 'pretty', 'much',

Actually, it turned out to be better than that. But I thought I would take a chance because I really like Kevin Costner's movies.Costner was good and Madeline Carroll (who plays the daughter) was terrific. Grammer and Hopper played dim-witted characters, but were good.  The implausible script even draws one in. The issues addressed in the film were pretty balanced and not too stereotypical of Democrats and Republicans.Here's where I had a problem: the entire supporting cast who are playing themselves, as political pundits, were significant or well-known far left ideologues. None from the right. No balance, to really make the film take on added realism. The producer's and director's bias came through here. If you doubt this, consider the following appearances: Campbell Brown, Arianna Huffington, James Carville, and Larry King. And then there were Bill Maher and Chris Matthews, who had a running part throughout the movie as the person who brings the news to the audience. Wow, that's a stretch!Anyway, rent it and be ready for a fun and escapist movie that starts to open up the sore that we call politics. It also has some good performances.

I could not say yes when Swing Vote was released.As I said in my previous The Guardian review, it seems like public/critics have wrote this movie off because of Kevin Costner.  He plays boozer, unemployed single dad who does not take anything seriously.  He got into the situation that the Presidential election is coming down to one vote/his vote.........This movie is surprisingly funny for the way politicians manipulate the public, and Costner plays dumb and dumber funny as he did as Roy in Tin Cup and Jake in Silverado.  Madeline Carroll who plays Costner's daughter is great surprise as well.  Do you remember last years critical claimed My Little Sunshine?  In my opinion Madeline Carroll  did better job than that little girl in MLS.I really like the fact that this movie did not try to force the political issue and yet it brings to the level to make us think about what is it going on in our country....especially, it was very close to presidential voting when this movie was released.....sad for me to say that box office failure of this movie is clear indication of how we let Hollywood/media/critics manipulate us and how ignorant we are....:(  people in the theater was crapping their hands at the end of the movie!  so there are a little hope..;) This is one of my favorite comedy drama in 2008, and I strongly recomand it to see!",5,This movie is quite a suprise!,1231977600,"01 15, 2009",2009,1518,"['2008', 'was', 'year', 'mega', 'budget', 'action', 'movie', 'such', 'Batman', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'Iron', 'man', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'ask', 'Have', 'seen', 'good', 'comedy', 'drama', 'year', 'could', 'not', 'say', 'yes', 'when', 'Swing', 'Vote', 'was', 'released.As', 'said', 'previous', 'Guardian', 'review', 'public/critics', 'have', 'wrote', 'movie', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'boozer', 'unemployed', 'single', 'dad', 'who', 'not', 'take', 'anything', 'seriously', 'got', 'situation', 'Presidential', 'election', 'coming', 'down', 'one', 'vote/his', 'vote', 'movie', 'surprisingly', 'funny', 'way', 'politicians', 'manipulate', 'public', 'Costner', 'dumb', 'dumber', 'funny', 'did', 'Roy', 'Tin', 'Cup', 'Jake', 'Silverado', 'Madeline', 'Carroll', 'who', 'Costner', 'daughter', 'great', 'surprise', 'as', 'well', 'Do', 'remember', 'last', 'years', 'critical', 'claimed', 'My', 'Little', 'Sunshine', 'opinion', 'Madeline', 'Carroll', 'did', 'better', 'job', 'little', 'girl', 'MLS.I', 'really', 'fact', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'try', 'force', 'political', 'issue', 'yet', 'level', 'make', 'think', 'what', 'going', 'country', '.especially', 'was', 'very', 'close', 'presidential', 'voting', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'released', '..sad', 'say', 'box', 'office', 'failure', 'movie', 'clear', 'indication', 'how', 'let', 'Hollywood/media/critics', 'manipulate', 'how', 'ignorant', 'are', 'people', 'theater', 'was', 'crapping', 'hands', 'end', 'movie', 'so', 'are', 'little', 'hope..', 'one', 'favorite', 'comedy', 'drama', '2008', 'strongly', 'recomand', 'see']",N/A

I thought it was as well written as it could have been for a movie that is somewhat limited in the direction it could take.  There were laugh out loud moments and other moments of pure corniness.  Kevin Costner plays a great Drunk and uniformed father but I thought the special role was played by his co star on screen daughter.The movie fell short in some areas:#1 once again the portrayal of American politicians whether democrat or republican was harsh and phony.  How stupid can we make our president look?.#2 This would have been better if they cut out the swear words and made it into more of a PG family film.  It was right in that gray area where I wouldn't want young kids to watch but it could have been a great movie if they hadn't tried to make it more of an adult hit.#3 If they actually wanted to make this movie more for adults then they didn't go far enough and they made every single character except for the daughter look too stupid to even live life.  Or was that the point?#4 Personally the way the movie sums up is a little rough.  But that is for you to decide.Overall will you enjoy this movie?  Yeah I think so but it could have been better and I think you will wish the same thing?  Is it better than a lot of movies out there? Yes so it isn't a complete life waster.

1204521,A25QJBK33C4O0R,B001ILFUBE,"terpfan1980 ""Barry""","[3, 4]","My wife and I watched Swing Vote on Blu-ray and found it enjoyable, though not necessarily much more than middle of the road for the overall package.While the Blu-ray touts high def (HD) picture and sound, the picture quality is nice but not much more than that as unfortunately there is just not much impressive scenery throughout the film to really wow the audience with.  What is there looks nice, and there are a couple of what could be called scenic shots, but much of the film takes place indoors and/or is compromised of a bunch of close-up shots of the characters that really drive the film.The story itself is cute but quite predictable election and family relationship comedy with Kevin Costner and Madeline Carroll.  Costner plays the part of a bum that is nicknamed Bud, about to lose his job because he takes too much sick time and can't seem to stay sober enough to get to work on time and/or not make a mess by accident.  Getting to work shouldn't be that difficult as his daughter Molly (Madeline Carroll) serves more as his guardian rather than the other way around.  Unfortunately, like Bud's work habits, his parenting skills are quite poor and it leaves Molly repeatedly disappointed in his efforts or lack there of.One of those disappointments comes when Molly is working on a school project that involves watching Bud practice his civic responsibility by voting in the national election.  Bud winds up drinking himself into a stupor when he's supposed to meet Molly at the polling place, and Molly takes matters into her own hands (again) and sneaks into the polling place and actual voting booth to register Bud's vote for him.  As things turn out the vote is never registered thanks to an error with the voting machine, yet Molly still has the receipt for the ballot.  Things go more than a little crazy from there when we learn that the election is a dead heat with the state of New Mexico up for grabs, the same state that (coincidentally) Molly and Bud live in.  It seems that even within the county that Bud lives in there's a dead heat, so Bud's 'one vote' must be cast to determine who the next President of the United States will be.Over the course of the nearly 2 hour running length we see Molly and Bud's relationship warts and all, and we might, just might, also see some growth from Bud as his 15 minutes of fame starts to flame out leaving his friends disappointed and jealous.  What makes the film a bit more fun is that viewers are treated to a total lampooning of both of the political parties and their sacred platforms.  In the effort to win the one all important vote the political operatives and candidates from those parties (played primarily by Stanley Tucci, Nathan Lane, Kelsey Grammer and Dennis Hopper) make promises to Bud and steal issues from each others sides so they can demonstrate to Bud why he needs to vote for their side.Sadly, while I found the film enjoyable, I don't think it would hold up to multiple viewings and therefore rates more of a 'rent it' rating from me rather than a buy it.Family viewers should be warned that Bud's language is coarse and could be objectionable.

When he forgets, it is she(played well by newcomer Madeline Carroll)who sneaks in, signs his name and would have voted if the cleaning person didn't accidentally remove the voting machine plug from the wall, causing major problems and leaving an entire Presidential election in the balance because both contenders has 270 votes each and needs his one to make it to the Presidency. So now it's off to New Mexico, where both contenders(Kelsey Grammar and Dennis Hopper)both bend to the will of their campaign managers(Stanley Tucci and Nathan Lane respectively)and do things that seemingly compromise their own views and values as well as give this man major props and rides and extras. It gets to the point that reporters and special interest groups are now in on the bandwagon taking over this little town JUST to make this one man see the light.

1204525,A1XBYZX09V1OB4,B001ILFUBE,Valerie J. Saturen,"[0, 2]","Ever wondered whether a single vote could determine the outcome of an election? This entertaining political satire imagines that very scenario. Bud (Kevin Costner), a newly laid off assembly line worker and single dad, forgets to vote only to find that his precocious, wise-beyond-her-years daughter Molly (Madeline Carroll) has cast his ballot for him. And there's more: for technical reasons, his ""vote"" wasn't registered, and the entire presidential election hangs in the balance. Bud is a caricature of the apathetic and uninformed American citizen who is more interested in drinking and fishing than in paying attention to politics (in fact, he doesn't even know who's running). Molly is his mostly unheeded social conscience; she understands and cares about the issues, reading and responding to the letters that pour in from fellow citizens who hope he will draw the candidates' attention to their hardships.The movie pokes fun not only at political apathy, but the political process itself. Desperate for Bud's vote, both candidates descend upon the little town of Texaco, New Mexico intent on winning him over, even if it means losing sight of their own ideals. Particularly hilarious are the over-the-top campaign ads playing to Bud's presumed fear of immigrants, environmentalism, and opposition to abortion, none of which really represent Bud's opinions anyway.If you like movies like THANK YOU FOR SMOKING and WAG THE DOG (or even OFFICE SPACE), you will probably enjoy SWING VOTE.

The one vote to break the tie has Bud's name on it.  He, alone, will determine the next president.When the news becomes public, news media, lobbyists, politicians, and curious voters descend on Bud's home town like a plague of locust.

Silently, behind him, she becomes the most important little girl.The premise staggers towards credibility, vaguely ridiculous at first glance, but only a step or two beyond what actually happened in the Bush/Gore presidential election. Something cynical in me just can't believe that The Powers That Be would actually play as fairly as they're shown playing in this movie. For all the bad behavior here, these fictional candidates never descend to the genuinely dirty tricks that mar real-world politics.Leaving the political story behind, the family drama draws on too many grim truths in the US today. Too many people really do live on the edge, and some of them fall off it, taking their kids with them. This ends happily, or at least with the possibility of happy outcome. Despite its dismal start and some low moments, it never loses hope and never loses the faith that one man can make a difference, even if it's just to his daughter.-- wiredweird, reviewing the theatrical release",4,"One man, one vote, no clue",1330214400,"02 26, 2012",2012,1553,"['Bud', 'precocious', 'daughter', 'maybe', 'even', 'more', 'mother', 'left', 'only', 'positive', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'edge', 'society', 'working', 'when', 'can', 'drinking', 'when', 'can', 'thinking', 'day', 'success', 'when', 'one', 'suit', 'uniform', 'knocks', 'door', 'fifth-grade', 'daughter', 'care', 'more', 'care', 'most', 'days', 'Then', 'when', 'civics', 'lessons', 'really', 'sink', 'learn', 'too', 'lesson', 'too', 'far', 'Unknown', 'Bud', 'just', 'became', 'most', 'important', 'man', 'country', 'Silently', 'most', 'important', 'little', 'girl.The', 'premise', 'staggers', 'towards', 'credibility', 'vaguely', 'ridiculous', 'first', 'glance', 'only', 'step', 'two', 'what', 'actually', 'happened', 'Bush/Gore', 'presidential', 'election', 'Something', 'cynical', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Powers', 'Be', 'would', 'actually', 'play', 'as', 'fairly', ""'re"", 'shown', 'playing', 'movie', 'bad', 'behavior', 'here', 'fictional', 'candidates', 'never', 'descend', 'genuinely', 'dirty', 'tricks', 'mar', 'real-world', 'politics.Leaving', 'political', 'story', 'family', 'drama', 'draws', 'too', 'many', 'grim', 'truths', 'US', 'today', 'Too', 'many', 'people', 'really', 'do', 'live', 'edge', 'fall', 'taking', 'kids', 'happily', 'least', 'possibility', 'happy', 'outcome', 'dismal', 'start', 'low', 'moments', 'never', 'hope', 'never', 'faith', 'one', 'man', 'can', 'make', 'difference', 'even', 'just', 'daughter.', 'wiredweird', 'reviewing', 'theatrical', 'release']",N/A
