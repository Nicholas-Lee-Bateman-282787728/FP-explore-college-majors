I enjoyed the movie and it was definitely thought provoking making you think about how this ""opposite"" would affect so many aspects of our lives and world.  The acting was a bit cheesy, but lots of fun.  I think when kids are so anxious to grow up, to have more control over their decisions and lives that this movie gives them some of that to fantasize about, but also leaves them with the message that they do need to be grateful for the parents that love them and that are (hopefully) lovingly guiding them through life until they are mature enough to embark life's journey on their own.  I do highly recommend this film for a fun filled time of imagination for your kids.",4,Interesting twist,1295308800,"01 18, 2011",2011,760,"['8', '10', 'year', 'old', 'watched', 'movie', 'five', 'times', 'two', 'days', 'loved', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'was', 'definitely', 'thought', 'provoking', 'making', 'think', 'how', 'opposite', 'would', 'affect', 'so', 'many', 'aspects', 'lives', 'world', 'acting', 'was', 'bit', 'cheesy', 'lots', 'fun', 'think', 'when', 'kids', 'are', 'so', 'anxious', 'grow', 'up', 'have', 'more', 'control', 'decisions', 'movie', 'fantasize', 'also', 'message', 'do', 'need', 'be', 'grateful', 'parents', 'love', 'are', 'hopefully', 'lovingly', 'guiding', 'life', 'are', 'mature', 'enough', 'embark', 'life', 'journey', 'own', 'do', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'fun', 'filled', 'time', 'imagination', 'kids']",Opposite Day

However, it just doesn't get beyond pure silliness. The movie is cute for a few minutes of watching kids in adults' suits and pretending to adults' jobs, and some of the images are priceless. However, that gets old pretty quickly. As for the plot and acting, they're just beyond the usual terrible fare. I can't predict how a kid would enjoy the movie, but my guess is it won't appeal to many.",2,Childish,1307750400,"06 11, 2011",2011,492,"['supposed', 'be', 'kids', 'movie', 'guess', 'amount', 'childishness', 'par', 'course', 'However', 'just', ""n't"", 'get', 'pure', 'silliness', 'movie', 'cute', 'few', 'minutes', 'watching', 'kids', 'adults', 'suits', 'pretending', 'adults', 'jobs', 'images', 'are', 'priceless', 'However', 'old', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'plot', 'acting', ""'re"", 'just', 'usual', 'terrible', 'fare', 'ca', ""n't"", 'predict', 'how', 'kid', 'would', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'guess', 'wo', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'many']",Opposite Day
