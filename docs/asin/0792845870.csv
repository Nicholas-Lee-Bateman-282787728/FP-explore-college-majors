154514,A2EOFYRFB292KS,0792845870,"Alberto M. Barral ""NY LuxViewer""","[6, 12]","The quality of the DVD is extremely poor, viewer be ware this is a cheap Korean product that will get stuck more than once, distort images and make the viewing itself an effort if not an outright ordeal.I have never seen the Shaw play, but this movie does not encourage a viewing. It is neither comical nor interesting as Shaw's Cleopatra is a silly Victorian girl, almost ready to ask for tea and scones, and always accompanied by a guardian that has the silliest, most ridiculous name imaginable. The Egyptian queen as here played by the beautiful Vivien Leigh, does looks gorgeous in the costumes but is unsuited for the role and this is not one of her most memorable efforts. We know from history that Cleopatra was extremely well educated, spoke seven languages and had a very well developed mind of her own by the time they met, so this characterization is a total failure in representing the historical character of the Queen, here represented in the mistaken understanding of it by Shaw. It does however follow the malevolent tradition, started by the Roman historians themselves of maligning the queen and her court by portraying a falsified image of the sophisticated Ptolemaic Alexandria. Here we see the Egyptian court as mainly a collection of ridiculous women running around Cleopatra as if it were an Arabian harem in the style of Hollywood, where Maureen O'Hara could find herself at home.It is particularly more difficult, yet nevertheless very telling of his character and age, to understand why Shaw saw the Egyptian queen as just a spoilt child, a fact that is more striking because at home, in England he had to have seen the accomplishments of the young Queen Victoria, who inherited the throne at the same age of eighteen as the Egyptian queen, and she started out her reign in 1837, almost twenty years before Shaw was born, so by the time he wrote his play he was more than familiar with this section of British contemporary (for him) history, but perhaps it was his racial and cultural prejudice that would not permit him to think of the two in the same level, or a natural aversion to credit women with anything of merit. Perhaps the fact that England had made Egypt a protectorate around the time his play was staged woudl make it politically correct to deride them as an inferior people. In any case, the idea that this eighteen year old queen, which considering the faster development of maturity in the Ancient world, was probably closer to twenty five in mental development, at least, would believe for a moment that the Romans could eat her as if they were cannibals is absolutely idiotic. Did Shaw forget that Cleopatra's father had plenty of dealings with the Romans, whom she must have seen close enough to know them in detail, from childhood?? It is even assumed by some historians that she accompanied her father to Rome in 57 b.c. when he went there to secure his throne and bribe Julius Ceasar and Pompey. Her entire political career proved that her assesment of their character and intentions was always accurate and on the mark, even when they had triumphed over her, for wasn't her suicide the perfectly calculated sabotage of Augustus triumph, as well as just as perfect, last grand gesture that utterly humilated that most burgeois of all Roman Emperors.Claude Rains does a good job at portraying the Julius Caesar that we know from British tradition: brilliant, aloof, witty yet totally ungraceful, unsensual and un-Italian. It is extremely detrimental to the originals, that we know must about the Romans in America through British perceptions of the late 19th Century historians that invariably incorporated middle-class, bourgeois ethics, not to mention racial and class perceptions that were totally absent from the society they were depicting. As pertaining to his private life, Julius Caesar was well know for being bi-sexual in ancient Rome, where he was commonly known as ""the husband of all women and the wife of all husbands"" yet from the performance by Rains we would be more inclined to believe he was a retiring school master from his conversation, and particularly his demeanor, when in the company of Cleopatra.Stewart Granger plays Apollodorus, an enterprising Sicilian that takes Cleopatra in a rug to Caesar. His is a character from fiction, as we know nothing of that boatman that carried the real Cleopatra to see Ceasar into the Royal Palace in Alexandria, not the lighthouse, as portrayed in the movie. Yet he does it well and is the only man capable of relaying in his demeanor some of the sensuality that is so completely absent from either Caesar or Cleopatra. Her maid and ""Mistress of the house"", played by Flora Robson is a wonderfully scheming character even though her name, Ftatateeta could only be the invention of a barbarian scribe, but the intention to demean, cheapen and malign the nature of ancient Egypt is definitely the reason it appears as such, though it may be argued that humor was the only reason. It should however been the name used for the title of the play, and movie, as it would be easier from that perspective to understand its intrinsically ridiculous character and intention, as well as the total break with the historical characters or even the older, better known, and far better work by Shakespeare.Both Shaw and the director of this movie decided to ignore the fact that by the time Caesar left Egypt, Cleopatra had given birth to a son of his, the only male child he ever sired and acknowledged, which is something that couldn't possibly have occurred, and publicly have been acknowledged by Caesar, had he not been engaging in regular sexual encounters with the queen for some time. This makes the complete absence of sexual tension or desire between Rains and Leigh incomprehensible, and not one bit comical. Their affair was real, not the ridiculous pantomime Shaw presented in the theater and this movie reproduces, and it simply follows the ancient tradition of natural attraction between young intelligent girls for older successful men who happen to also have regular erections, which has endured to our own times, and is hard to believe could have escaped Mr. Shaw's observations.I do not recommend the movie, as entertainment as it is extremely annoying, but it does have some interesting sets and costumes, if this happens to be a particular area of interest for the viewer. The real value of the film is accidental, as a documentation of the continued misrepresentation of Ancient cultures which has been and continues to be a major problem of contemporary education and particularly film representation in America that is long overdue reassessment and correction. It perpetuates prejudices, ethnic and cultural while portraying as history a largely fictional, biased creation. Although the film is an insightful commentary on the narrow and limited Victorian vision of the subject, it is nevertheless a malicious effort to distort historical veracity, to hide and distort the ethnic and cultural diversity of ancient Alexandria, which was once the very center of intellectual discourse of the civilized world, and the keeper of its cultural accomplishments in the famed library. Its tolerance of alternative sexuality and its unique mixture of Egyptian and Greek cultures could not possibly be more removed from the suburban, provincial society that is depicted in the movie, and as such it should be viewed and understood. This may well have been Shaw's understanding and intention for his prejudiced play, but I find that these movies should now have a disclaimer attached to the credits so that contemporary audiences, already more removed from classical history than their parents or grandparents, should be aware that they are viewing the interpretation and creation of one white male individual, largely expounding outdated and discredited ideas of colonial Imperialism and racial/cultural superiority which are no longer acceptable in the international stage. Specifically it should be clarified that this is his vision and not the consensus of civilized and educated opinion. It should be stressed that this is an entirely fictional story loosely inspired on Ancient events, and intended for comedy, hard as that may be to appreciate from our contemporary viewpoint.",2,Bad

It's wholly unrealistic and ahistorical.  It's also quite boring at times.  Leigh reminds one of Judy Garland in The Pirate two years later--going under, plagued by her demons, and overacting shamelessly.  Rains is fine, as long as you think of Caesar as 5 foot three inches and wandering the desert alone, spouting often hammy lines.  If you like the play, you'll no doubt appreciate the film.  For most people, this is something to avoid.  The Koreans, by the way, would do well to learn how to spell the actors' names and place them in the appropriate place on the box.

154518,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,0792845870,Dr. James Gardner,"[5, 7]","""Caesar and Cleopatra"" is based on a play written by George Bernard Shaw in 1898. Shaw (1856-1950) was one of the greatest playwrights of all time, and the only person to ever win a Nobel Prize (1925) for Literature and an Oscar (1938). His plays include ""Candida"" (1894), ""The Devil's Disciple"" (1897), ""Man and Superman"" (1903), ""Don Juan in Hell"" (1903), ""Androcles and the Lion"" (1912), ""Pygmalion"" (1912), and ""Saint Joan"" (1923).The play's U.S. premiere was in 1925 and starred Lionel Atwill and Helen Hayes. This 1945 film was the first adaptation of his play for film, and Shaw helped adapt it for the screen. Bear in mind, this is a filmed version of a play, rather than a film about Caesar and Cleopatra.Vivien Leigh (1913-67) stars as Cleopatra. She is best known for her stunning performances in ""GWTW"" (1939) as Scarlett O'Hara and as Blanche Dubois in ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" (1951) - she won the Oscar both times. Eventually physical problems, a miscarriage, and the difficulty of living with husband Laurence Olivier would take their toll and she began a slow descent into madness, perhaps precipitated by the 326 performances as Dubois on stage in London followed by months filming the movie. Between 1955 and 1965 she made only 1 film, but she carried on with her theatre work and even won a Tony in 1963. Her last film appearance was in 1965 (""Ship of Fools"").Cleopatra has been the subject of many films, the most famous being the 1963 production starring Elizabeth Taylor. Other actors who played Cleopatra include Theda Bara (1917), Claudette Colbert (1934), Pauline Letts (1951), Rhonda Fleming (1953), Virginia Mayo (1957), Lynn Redgrave (1983), and Leonor Varela (1999).At the time of the film, Leigh was 32 years old, playing a teenage Cleopatra. In and of itself this isn't a problem, as many other actresses played the youthful Cleopatra when they were relatively long in the tooth (e.g., Elizabeth Taylor and Theda Bara were 31, Claudette Colbert was 34, and Virginia Mayo was 37). But all these other screen portrayals played Cleopatra as an adult, only Leigh tries to play her as a bouncy teenager.Claude Rains (1889-1967) co-stars as Caesar. Best remembered for his roles as ""The Invisible Man"" (1933) and Captain Renault opposite Humphrey Bogart in ""Casablanca"" (1942), Rains had a brilliant career including supporting roles as Prince John in ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" (1938), the evil Senator in ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" (1939), Job Skeffinton in ""Mr. Skeffington"" (1941) and the politically astute Mr. Dryden in ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962). Along the way he received 4 nominations as Best Supporting Actor. Bette Davis considered him the best actor she ever worked with.Caesar has been portrayed by Louis Calhern (1953), John Gavin (1960), Rex Harrison (1963), John Gielgud (1970), Timothy Dalton (1999), Klaus Maria Brandauer (2001) and Colm Feore (2005).Caesar was in his mid 50s when he met Cleopatra. Rains was the perfect age, as were most actors who played Caesar - Rex Harrison was 55, Brandauer was 57, and Calhern was 58. Only Gielguld at 66 was a bit old to be played Caesar.Flora Robson (1902-1984) appears as Cleopatra's nurse. She appeared in more than 50 films and was nominated for an Oscar for her role in ""Saratoga Trunk"" (1945).  Robson and Rains often worked together in films like ""The Sea Hawk"" (1940) and ""Elizabeth and Essex"" (1939) and she was paired with Leigh in ""Fire Over England"" (1937). Robson is funny in her over-the-top portrayal here.Gabriel Pascal (1894-1954) directed and produced. Pascal was known for his adaptations of Shaw's plays, including ""Pygmalion"" (1938) and ""Androlocles and the Lion"" (1952). It's Pascal who wanted to make Pygmalion into a musical, but Shaw objected, and it was only after Shaw's death that ""My Fair Lady"" (1956) appeared.The NY Times' Bosley Crowther said the film was ""an elegant spectacle"" with a ""remarkably entertaining cast."" He said the ""sets have a rich and regal splendor, his costumes have great exotic charm and his people who wear and populate them play the Shavian whim to the hilt.""1945 was not a banner year for films. The top grossing films were ""Mom and Dad"", ""The Bells of St. Mary's"", ""Leave Her to Heaven"", ""Spellbound"", and ""Anchors Aweigh."" The big Oscar and Golden Globe winner was ""The Lost Weekend"" (Picture, Director, Actor). Notable films released that year included Joan Crawford's Oscar winning ""Mildred Pierce"" and film noir classic ""Scarlett Street"".One of the problems with this film is that it is a filmed play, and not really a film. It would be better entitled ""George Bernard Shaw's Caesar and Cleopatra"" so that people understand they are going to watch a filmed version of a play, and not really a movie. Personally I don't find this a problem, as there is considerable worth in seeing a play on film. But some film goers may find this objectionable.Another problem with this film in Leigh's attempt to be a bouncy teenager. As good an actress as she was, and she was a really good one, at 32 even she cannot convincingly be bouncy.Fans of Leigh will delight in  her portrayal, and for a woman in her 30s, she does do a great imitation of a bouncy teenager. And of course, Claude Rains is always good to watch. But be warned, this is a filmed play, and a play that is well out of date by today's standards, so unless you're prepared to accept this, you may be disappointed.",2,Shaw's Cleopatra,1308700800,"06

The casting of VIVIEN LEIGH was a successful one, although critics dissected both her and the film with the writer`s approval(Shaw to Pascal: &quot;She`s all wrong. Must I drill her in diction?&quot;) Vivien suffered a miscarriage after falling beating the slave and suffered from her first attacks of manic depressions. Tubercoloses was shortly afterwards also diagnosed. However; the production was Britain`s most expensive failure, as Taylor`s CLEOPATRA in 63 - the Worlds greatest financial failure for 20th Century-Fox. VIVIEN LEIGH is at her best playing a kittenish girl who must transform into a reigning queen. Naturally, Leigh does it with great style. Look for Vivien`s look-alike Jean Simmons playing the harp in Vivien`s confrontation scene with her women slaves. No wonder Olivier chose Simmons for his Ophelia i Hamlet 1948.

A great cast, the best interpretation of Cleo and a great performance Claude Rains as Caesar.While like most Hollywood (or British) movies on this genera liberties are taken with historical facts, the story, the cast and the overallentertaining value is just outstanding.  I am kind of an unpaid expert on ancient civilizations, especially Rome, Greece and Egypt.  Ihave hundreds of books  on  the subjects, modern history and also the ancient writers such as Livius and Herodotus(!) and I eat thisstuff up.  This film is sometimes called a comedy, but it has is serious, dark sides as well.  The portrait of Cleo by Vivian Leigh isbrilliant in my view, because Cleo was only 19 when Caesar first met her.  Liz Taylor, while playing the conniving queen well, did notcome off as a young girl of 19.  Leigh did, very childish at times, but also very brutish at times when Caesar was not watching.Claude Rains come off marvelously both as the vain Consul, and yet compassionate and politically astute genius.  His deathgoes down in history as one of the great murders of all time. along with Lincolns assassination.  What might these men havedone for their respective republics being torn apart by civil wars.  We shall never know.Did you know that Cleo actually married twice, both hubbies were her brothers and she managed to have  them both killed.  Noneof the Cleo movies show more than one bother.  In Egypt, pharaohs had to marry some blood family female (mother, sister orbrother in case she is a queen) in order to inherit the pharaohnic powers to rule. Actually Cleo could not be a Pharaoh but couldbe Queen thus Miss Big or THE BOSS.  Who can argue with that.  NOTE; Pharaoh (Per-a) means Great House.

Shaw is very talky and hard to 'transfer' to motion picture standards of verisimulitude, but this movie has a beautiful, delightful Vivien Leigh, the incomparable Claude Rains, the beautifully dashing Stewart Granger, plus 'old friends' of the classic British cinema such as Flora Robson, Felix Aylmer, Basil Sidney, Stanley Holloway, Leo Genn, Francis L. Sullivan -- all who appeared in wonderful films like Laurence Olivier's 'Hamlet', David Lean's 'Great Expectations' and many other intelligent pictures of that pre- and post-war (WWII, that is) period. (There is even a very very young, but very lovely as always, Jean Simmons as a slave of Cleopatra who plays the harp.)The picture attempts an 'epic' look, with battles yet noted I'm afraid by unconvincing stunt work and 'casts of thousands' sort of milling about -- and Cecil B. De Mille does this so much better than Gabriel Pascal, the director of 'Caesar and Cleopatra'. But I myself admit I love the Shavian ambience -- the intellectual activist actually attractive (in Shaw's plays at least!) to the winsome young woman; ... friendship, discussion and respect; thought as more important than 'action-adventure'.If Shaw's plays do seem too dated to you and they generally bore you, yes, stay far away from this film! But if you brighten when 'entertainment' is also provocative to the intellect and not only to the eye (and other sense organs) -- and particularly if you have great affection for the era of British cinema dominated by Olivier, David Lean, and the early Tony Richardson and featuring so many familiar and adept character actors that fill the firmament with 'supporting' stars, you will like the movie, and ignoring its quite obvious flaws, enjoy every minute: I guarantee it!...",4,It's Still A Delight!

Walker ""catu11us""","[34, 37]","It's our amazing good fortune to have this document of one of George Bernard Shaw's greatest plays, filmed during his lifetime so that he could author the screenplay as he wrote the original stage work.  It is a monument to the magnificence, not only of Shaw, but of Caesar.  It is also a monument to Shaw's brilliant playcraft, clever plotting, and canny application of humor.  It goes without saying that Shaw was brilliant, since of course he was a socialist.We have seen this story before, though differently told, when the wonderful Rex Harrison played Caesar to the talented Elizabeth Taylor's Cleopatra.  (Both of these names should be written with a K, since that is how they were both actually pronounced.)  It is an absolute truth about that later film that only the first half is much worth watching, since Richard Burton in the second half plays a lovesick puppy so well it's thoroughly disgusting.  GBS avoids that pitfall by giving us a great Caesar and a delightful Cleopatra, and fabulous stars to play them.Shaw's play tells the story of Caesar's occupation of Alexandria after his final defeat of Pompey, and his defense of his position against perfidious Egyptians and renegade Romans in the service of Ptolemy XIV, Cleopatra's prepubescent brother and husband.  The text is a creation of the utmost cunning: nothing less than a successful imitation of Shakespeare (though mostly in a more modern idiom).  Few writers other than Shaw would have attempted this feat, and fewer still would have been successful at it.Mentioning Ptolemy XIV, I should mention his (and Cleo's) brother, Ptolemy XIII.  They were both married to Cleopatra and each of them was pounding on her bedroom door by the time he was 10.  The film, alas, forgets the last Ptolemy, the XVth, called Caesarion, Caesar's son by Cleopatra.  It was his official acknowledgement of this son that caused him so much trouble back home.The essence of Shaw is of course his wit.  Hardly a play of his is as witty as this one.  The film is 2 hours long and seems scarcely an hour, so packed is it with sparkling dialogue.To portray this great literary work, the producers have assembled a gallery of some of the greatest actors of the time.  Caesar is played by the hugely talented Claude Rains whose portrayals of iconic roles have made him one of the greatest actors of the last century.  He gives the immortal Julius such sangfroid and cool calculation as to make us instantly believe his greatness as a general and statesman.Cleopatra is portrayed by the great Vivien Leigh, who graced and enhanced every part she took.  Her beauty is in fact far, far greater than the legendary queen's (we have pictures).  There is a rumor that Cleopatra was African (black) by descent - which, while not a big deal, is a lie.  We know each and every one of her ancestors since before the time of Alexander the Great, and they are all Greek (and mostly closely related).  Shaw also cleverly switches the story of the rug from her first meeting with Caesar to ruse to smuggle her into Caesar's emergency redoubt at the Pharos (the Alexandria lighthouse).Apollodoros (misspelt with a ""u"" before the ""s""), the Greek jack of all trades, arts, and talents, is played with huge humor by the inimitable Stewart Granger.  Granger's acting talents gave both of the Fairbanks a run for their money.  Cleopatra's nurse and chief bottle washer, Ftatateeta, is portrayed by the wonderful Flora Robson.  For this part her skin is stained dusky and she's given an Egyptian-style fright wig ... and is absolutely convincing.  When she's on camera, she manages to upstage even the riveting Rains.The roll of talented veteran actors continues.  As Pothinos (misspelt with a ""us""), Ptolemy's puppet master and master of all nasty diplomatic maneuvers, we have Francis L. Sullivan.  It was Pothinos' idea to knock off Pompey in the hope of sucking up to Caesar.  No such luck, of course, because Caesar greatly admired and liked Pompey despite the fact that they had recently become enemies.  Sullivan portrays Pothinos with delightful wiliness and sliminess.  ***  As the loyal Rufio, ""Caesar's shield"", we have a steadfast Basil Sydney.  Rufio eventually becomes Roman ""governor"" of Egypt, although that country was then still technically independent and didn't have a governor.  Rufio's part is given a good shot of good-humored testosterone and Sydney gives it great stature.  ***  The talented veteran Cecil Parker gives us Caesar's faithful British amanuensis, Britannus.  His physical stature and Druidic appearance make him very convincing as a 1st-Century BCE British warrior-poet.  ***  And so on.  Every part in this film is well-played by people who know what they're doing.The DVD itself was manufactured in Korea.  Don't expect a lot.  This Technicolor film has a washed-out look ... although the colors are usually clear if not vividly bright.  The sound is good (but could be better) and as we might expect from actors of stage quality, the dialogue is clear.  There are, in addition, English subtitles.  There are no extra features, but with older films we seldom get them.  Some people might take points off for substandard color and sound.  So do I.  I give extra stars for Shaw's genius and take them off for an inferior recording of the original film.  That leaves the correct total:  the maximum.It's sad that shallow people with no appreciation of theater or great playwriting should inflict low-star ratings on this immortal film.  It's an insult to the greatest English playwright since Shakespeare.",5,The magnificence of Shaw and Caesar,1206144000,"03 22, 2008",2008,5569,"['amazing', 'good', 'fortune', 'have', 'document',

If Cleopatra were to see how she is played in this film she would roll over in her tomb. Her ""nurse"" tells her she needs a bath everyday. Caesar tells Cleopatra that he must eat her - like he was talking to a child and does refer to her as ""my child"" throughout and a pouty one at that. ""before Caesar I was foolish and did what I like - now that Caesar has made me wise I do what must be done and have no time to attend to myself"". Would the real Cleopatra think she was foolish until Caesar came into her life? Not hardly. Later Cleopatra tells Caesar ""I'm only a child and pouts"". Story takes place when Caesar meets Cleopatra (at the bottom of a sphyinx?) for years - no mention of the child she had with Caesar. If we didn't know history we would think it more a father/child relationship instead of lovers. This Cleopatra is childish, stupid and definitely not seductive. Even at the end of the movie Caesar tells Cleopatra she is ""as much a child as ever Cleopatra - haven't I made a woman of you after all"" - Caesar tells Cleopatra that he will send her a man (Antony)and kisses (the only kiss) on her forehead.
