1052910,A11PTCZ2FM2547,B000N3SU92,,"[5, 5]","Goodness.  Think of all the books, films, television shows, that deal with infidelity, suburban angst, yuppie boredom.  Well, director Todd Field has found a way to teach a new trick to an old dog:  Have as the background to the affair the trials and tribulations of a convicted pedophile coming back to the neighborhood from jail. On top of that, Field brings an edgy brand of humor--humor with an attitude--to his critically-acclaimed film, LITTLE CHILDREN.What kind of humor?  Walking in on a porn-crazed hubby sitting at his computer humor; a blind date between the pedophile and nerdy girl humor; the childish antics of an adult football league game humor.  Voiced over by a solemn narrator, it's humor that connects--while simultaneously evoking a shudder.  And it is a winning vehicle that makes this film work.Kate Winslet is a brilliant actress (not to mention easy on the eye).  Playing a bored housewife--a wife out of touch with the other clingy and whiny bored housewives of the neighborhood--Winslet draws sympathy and ire as she has an affair with the local househusband (a muscle-bound Patrick Wilson).  For his part, Wilson is solid as an ambition-challenged hubby who regrets being an adult.  Jennifer Connelly has a surprisingly limited role as Wilson's career-oriented, yet frustrated, wife.  And the convicted offender (Jackie Earle Haley). . .I haven't seen anything that creepy since Roger Clemens went before Congress.With its dark humor and brooding drama, LITTLE CHILDREN is fun to watch.  The ending was a tad over the top (actually, it was a lot over the top), hence the four stars.  Definitely celluloid worth viewing.--D.

Probing below their decency, director Todd Field unfolds a vision where everyone is found out to be amiss in some way.  Although `Little Children' is the title, the adults headline the movie, even if the children become their antecedent reflection.  Sara (Kate Winslet) brings her daughter, Lucy, daily to the pool or park.  While Lucy plays, Sara listens to the idle chatter of other moms.  Her path crosses with Brad (Patrick Wilson)--known to them as ""The Prom King""--when they bet her she can't obtain his phone number.  Immediately, she makes a move, and, when successful, they become indignant, even if they only refer to him in lustful terms.  Brad also brings his son, Aaron, to the pool and park.  He's the caretaker, studying for his bar exam, while his wife remains the breadwinner away at work.  Sara catches her husband, Richard, having a fantasy affair with someone on the Internet.  Brad seems to go through the motions of a marriage with a wife he considers ""a knockout"".  This gives them a justifying context for adultery. At first their infatuation starts as companionship, but a storm consummates their infidelity.  In the meantime, child sex offender, Ronald (Jackie Earle Hayley), known for exposing himself to children, has moved into town, even as his face is plastered on every post and broadcast on the local news.  He has the disposition only a mother could love.  (""You're a miracle,"" she tells him, ""...because as humans we all know the people we love can be taken away."" ""Animals aren't like that,"" she reminds him.)  Brad also makes reluctant connections with Larry, a disturbed ex-police officer friend who had an entailed mishap with an alleged young mall-sniper. He enlists Brad on ""The Guardians"" football team, a group of officers whose campaign against Ronald is the focus of their camaraderie.  Insecure, he seems to need ""Ronnie"" as a scapegoat for his own shortcomings.The movie's acting has been justly lauded, and the haunting development is a real draw.  Thinking the movie might be a travesty, I was surprised by the humane treatment it gave its subject matter(s).  It`s easy to see why critics are raving and the public is turning away.  Hard to describe, sometimes 'Little Children' seems like 'Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman' without the laughs.  There's a build up to the movie, though.  Using the town's train as a sort of Freudian metaphor and atmosphere of tension and passion, the movie meets it's climax with some thoughts to ponder.  `Little Children' studies the premise we are all half living:  What would happen if everyone got what one wanted?  The film answers this question by asking a different question.  If everyone got what they wanted, who would suffer?  Surely, only a decent person could answer.",4,Probing Decency,1174262400,"03 19, 2007",2007,2896,"['Audacious', 'unpredictable', 'Little', 'Children', 'focuses', 'few', 'lives', 'East', 'Wyndorf', 'pleasant', 'sleepy', 'suburban', 'town', 'Massachusetts', 'Probing', 'decency', 'director', 'Todd', 'Field', 'vision', 'where', 'everyone', 'found', 'be', 'amiss', 'way', 'Little', 'Children', 'title', 'adults', 'headline', 'movie', 'even', 'children', 'become', 'antecedent', 'reflection', 'Sara', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'daughter', 'Lucy', 'daily', 'pool', 'park', 'Lucy', 'plays', 'Sara', 'idle', 'chatter', 'other', 'moms', 'path', 'crosses', 'Brad', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'known', 'Prom', 'King', 'when', 'bet', 'ca', ""n't"", 'obtain', 'phone', 'number', 'Immediately', 'move', 'when', 'successful', 'become', 'indignant', 'even', 'only', 'refer', 'lustful', 'terms', 'Brad', 'also', 'son', 'Aaron', 'pool', 'park', 'caretaker', 'studying', 'bar', 'exam', 'wife', 'breadwinner', 'away', 'work', 'Sara', 'husband', 'Richard', 'having', 'fantasy', 'affair', 'someone', 'Internet', 'Brad', 'go', 'motions', 'marriage', 'wife', 'knockout', 'justifying', 'context', 'adultery', 'first', 'infatuation', 'companionship', 'storm', 'infidelity', 'meantime', 'child', 'sex', 'offender', 'Ronald', 'Jackie', 'Earle', 'Hayley', 'known', 'exposing', 'children', 'moved', 'town', 'even', 'face', 'plastered', 'post', 'broadcast', 'local', 'news', 'disposition', 'only', 'mother', 'could', 'love', ""'re"", 'miracle', 'because', 'humans', 'know', 'people', 'love', 'can', 'be', 'taken', 'away', 'Animals', 'are', ""n't"", 'Brad', 'also', 'reluctant', 'connections', 'Larry', 'disturbed', 'ex-police', 'officer', 'friend', 'who', 'had', 'entailed', 'mishap', 'alleged', 'young', 'mall-sniper', 'Brad', 'Guardians', 'football', 'team', 'group', 'officers', 'campaign', 'Ronald', 'focus', 'camaraderie', 'Insecure', 'need', 'Ronnie', 'scapegoat', 'own', 'shortcomings.The', 'movie', 'acting', 'been', 'justly', 'lauded', 'haunting', 'development', 'real', 'draw', 'Thinking', 'movie', 'might', 'be', 'travesty', 'was', 'surprised', 'humane', 'treatment', 'gave', 'subject', 'matter', 's', 's', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'critics', 'are', 'raving', 'public', 'turning', 'away', 'Hard', 'describe', 'sometimes', ""'Little"", 'Children', ""'Mary"", 'Hartman', 'Mary', 'Hartman', 'laughs', 'build', 'up', 'movie', 'though', 'Using', 'town', 'train', 'sort', 'Freudian', 'metaphor', 'atmosphere', 'tension', 'passion', 'movie', 'climax', 'thoughts', 'ponder', 'Little', 'Children', 'studies', 'premise', 'are', 'half', 'living', 'What', 'would', 'happen', 'everyone', 'got', 'what', 'one', 'wanted', 'film', 'answers', 'question', 'asking', 'different', 'question', 'everyone', 'got', 'what', 'wanted', 'who', 'would', 'suffer', 'Surely', 'only', 'decent', 'person', 'could', 'answer']",N/A

1052915,A1LMBOI3T91P87,B000N3SU92,Allan M. Lees,"[6, 6]","Although Kate Winslet turns in a typically fine performance, there are many reasons to watch this movie.  Other reviewers have covered the essential plot points so this review will focus instead on the craft of the movie.  There's not a performance out of place, and each character is well-rounded enough that even potentially stereotypical roles are fleshed out enough to be believable.In part the movie could be a scathing indictment of middle-class American life in which almost everyone appears to be living lives of quiet desparation.  But although making more than a nod to the cliches of repressed housewives and porno-surfing executives, the movie goes deeply enough into specifics to cause us to feel sympathy for people we otherwise might dismiss as mere cyphers.  It's difficult, in today's politically correct society, to imagine a movie that enables us to feel sympathy for a convicted sex-offender, but that's what happens here in an almost by-the-way manner.Small roles provide delight.  For example, the overweight middle-aged neighbor who encourages Sarah to attend a meeting of her reading group and keeps referring to her as their ""new little sister.""  Or any of the women in that same reading group, who convey so much through gesture and expression, yet don't steal the scene.Best of all is the photography.  Choice camera angles capture moment and mood superbly.  When we first see Brad at home with his wife and child, the camera is off-set slightly so that although the three of them are symmetrically placed around the dining table, our view results in Brad seeming isolated on the left while his wife opposite seems to be practically merged with her son, an effect accentuated by her posture.  Later, Brad's marital situation seems captured by the image of an empty child-swing that eerily resembles a chastity belt, followed immediately by the bars of a cage - which, as the camera pulls back, turns out to be a supermarket shopping cart.  Little touches like this delight the attentive viewer as much as the excellent acting and assured direction.The craft of the movie is such that it seems appropriate, even, that the ending should deliver optimism in the midst of confusion and despair.In short, if you enjoy intelligent and well-made movies, this is well worth seeing.",4,Best supporting everything,1185580800,"07 28, 2007",2007,2300,"['Kate', 'Winslet', 'typically', 'fine', 'performance', 'are', 'many', 'reasons', 'watch', 'movie', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'covered', 'essential', 'plot', 'points', 'so', 'review', 'will', 'focus', 'instead', 'craft', 'movie', 'not', 'performance', 'place', 'character', 'well-rounded', 'enough', 'even', 'potentially', 'stereotypical', 'roles', 'are', 'fleshed', 'out', 'enough', 'be', 'believable.In', 'part', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'scathing', 'indictment', 'middle-class', 'American', 'life', 'almost', 'everyone', 'be', 'living', 'lives', 'quiet', 'desparation', 'making', 'more', 'nod', 'cliches', 'repressed', 'housewives', 'porno-surfing', 'executives', 'movie', 'deeply', 'enough', 'specifics', 'cause', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'people', 'otherwise', 'might', 'dismiss', 'mere', 'cyphers', 'difficult', 'today', 'politically', 'correct', 'society', 'imagine', 'movie', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'convicted', 'sex-offender', 'what', 'here', 'almost', 'by-the-way', 'manner.Small', 'roles', 'provide', 'delight', 'example', 'overweight', 'middle-aged', 'neighbor', 'who', 'Sarah', 'attend', 'meeting', 'reading', 'group', 'referring', 'new', 'little', 'sister', 'women', 'same', 'reading', 'group', 'who', 'convey', 'so', 'much', 'gesture', 'expression', 'yet', 'do', ""n't"", 'steal', 'scene.Best', 'photography', 'Choice', 'camera', 'capture', 'moment', 'mood', 'superbly', 'When', 'first', 'see', 'Brad', 'home', 'wife', 'child', 'camera', 'off-set', 'slightly', 'so', 'three', 'are', 'symmetrically', 'placed', 'dining', 'table', 'view', 'results', 'Brad', 'seeming', 'isolated', 'left', 'wife', 'opposite', 'be', 'practically', 'merged', 'son', 'effect', 'accentuated', 'posture', 'Later', 'Brad', 'marital', 'situation', 'captured', 'image', 'empty', 'child-swing', 'eerily', 'chastity', 'belt', 'followed', 'immediately', 'bars', 'cage', 'camera', 'back', 'out', 'be', 'supermarket', 'shopping', 'cart', 'Little', 'touches', 'delight', 'attentive', 'viewer', 'as', 'much', 'excellent', 'acting', 'assured', 'direction.The', 'craft', 'movie', 'such', 'appropriate', 'even', 'ending', 'should', 'deliver', 'optimism', 'midst', 'confusion', 'despair.In', 'short', 'enjoy', 'intelligent', 'well-made', 'movies', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing']",N/A

1052917,A1XKI53W1E891T,B000N3SU92,Amy,"[3, 3]","Little Children is not for the faint of heart. There is much to be shocked by in the little town we find ourselves introduced to through the eyes of lonely stay at home mother Sarah, who likes to pass her time at the playground musing that she is only a voyeur in her life, as she studies the other moms under a microscope. Sarah's unhappiness is obvious in her words and her expressions. With little knowledge of her background, we can imagine she was destined for more than the unhappiness of babysitting a toddler with a strong dislike towards car seats. The film seeks to exploit the unhappiness of an entire town to draw a sharp light to the way even grown ups can act like little children in the most inconceivably reckless ways.The film starts in a small park in tree lined suburbia where three chatty women are watching their young children play while discussing the latest neighborhood gossip. A fourth young woman, Sarah has a bench to herself nearby, nose in a book, seemingly not interested in joining their cattiness. Then the women's attention comes to rest on a dreamy father bringing his young son in to play. Brad pushes his young son in a swing, oblivious to the attention of the moms so caught up with their mystery man that they have secretly nicknamed him ""The Prom King."" Sarah becomes curious about him and learns that the three women have never even dared to talk to him. Taking this as a challenge to light up her dreary day, she bets them she can get his phone number. She takes her daughter over to the swing set where the two almost immediately open up to each other with an inquisitive chat. Letting Brad in on the bet, what starts as a playful kiss in front of the other children and women turns into a quiet moment of recognition between the two, a meeting of lonely hearts.Sarah thinks she has good reason to be dissatisfied with her tedious life. She has a master's in English lit and feels trapped in a loveless marriage. Brad has graduated law school and is married to a gorgeous documentary filmmaker, but has trouble letting go of the past. Unable to pass the bar exam out of pure indifference, he finds himself watching the care free antics of skateboarders when he should be studying for the bar exam. As Sarah and Brad continue to find themselves drawn to each other, where they meet at the local community pool every afternoon with their kids as an escape from their lives, the relationship is platonic at first but tension hangs heavy in the air. One can easily see where this is going, however, and a day at the pool that ends in rain confirms our suspicions.  A significant subplot features the return of Ronald McGorvey to the home of his mother after serving time in  jail as a convicted sex offender. The buzz of his return is heard around the neighborhood as a committee is formed to protest his presence. McGorvey seemingly just wants to get on with his life, and wants to rid himself of his problem, but has trouble letting go of his own past and desires with one reason being that people won't let him.Little Children draws us in, asking us to sympathize and empathize, before striking at us for attempting to be too forgiving or understanding. Little Children is a psychological drama that is haunting long after the heartrending ending has worn itself away. The film begs the question, Is Ronald the only monster in this tale of woe where adults left to their own devices can wreak a kind of havoc that would send ripples through any neighborhood? We know all know that birds of a feather flock together, but at what cost? Little Children asks us to ponder this and other heavy subjects.",5,Little Children DVD,1203984000,"02 26, 2008",2008,3640,"['Little', 'Children', 'not', 'faint', 'heart', 'much', 'be', 'shocked', 'little', 'town', 'find', 'introduced', 'eyes', 'lonely', 'stay', 'home', 'mother', 'Sarah', 'who', 'pass', 'time', 'playground', 'musing', 'only', 'voyeur', 'life', 'studies', 'other', 'moms', 'microscope', 'Sarah', 'unhappiness', 'obvious', 'words', 'expressions', 'little', 'knowledge', 'background', 'can', 'imagine', 'was', 'destined', 'more', 'unhappiness', 'babysitting', 'toddler', 'strong', 'dislike', 'towards', 'car', 'seats', 'film', 'exploit', 'unhappiness', 'entire', 'town', 'draw', 'sharp', 'light', 'way', 'even', 'grown', 'ups', 'can', 'act', 'little', 'children', 'most', 'inconceivably', 'reckless', 'ways.The', 'film', 'small', 'park', 'tree', 'lined', 'suburbia', 'where', 'three', 'chatty', 'women', 'are', 'watching', 'young', 'children', 'play', 'discussing', 'latest', 'neighborhood', 'gossip', 'fourth', 'young', 'woman', 'Sarah', 'bench', 'herself', 'nearby', 'nose', 'book', 'seemingly', 'not', 'interested', 'joining', 'cattiness', 'Then', 'women', 'attention', 'rest', 'dreamy', 'father', 'bringing', 'young', 'son', 'play', 'Brad', 'young', 'son', 'swing', 'oblivious', 'attention', 'moms', 'so', 'caught', 'up', 'mystery', 'man', 'have', 'secretly', 'nicknamed', 'Prom', 'King', 'Sarah', 'curious', 'three', 'women', 'have', 'never', 'even', 'dared', 'talk', 'Taking', 'challenge', 'light', 'up', 'dreary', 'day', 'can', 'get', 'phone', 'number', 'daughter', 'swing', 'set', 'where', 'two', 'almost', 'immediately', 'open', 'up', 'other', 'inquisitive', 'chat', 'Letting', 'Brad', 'bet', 'what', 'playful', 'kiss', 'front', 'other', 'children', 'women', 'quiet', 'moment', 'recognition', 'two', 'meeting', 'lonely', 'hearts.Sarah', 'thinks', 'good', 'reason', 'be', 'dissatisfied', 'tedious', 'life', 'master', 'English', 'lit', 'feels', 'trapped', 'loveless', 'marriage', 'Brad', 'graduated', 'law', 'school', 'married', 'gorgeous', 'documentary', 'filmmaker', 'trouble', 'letting', 'go', 'past', 'Unable', 'pass', 'bar', 'pure', 'indifference', 'watching', 'care', 'free', 'antics', 'skateboarders', 'when', 'should', 'be', 'studying', 'bar', 'exam', 'Sarah', 'Brad', 'continue', 'find', 'drawn', 'other', 'where', 'meet', 'local', 'community', 'pool', 'afternoon', 'kids', 'escape', 'lives', 'relationship', 'platonic', 'first', 'tension', 'hangs', 'heavy', 'air', 'One', 'can', 'easily', 'see', 'where', 'going', 'however', 'day', 'pool', 'rain', 'confirms', 'suspicions', 'significant', 'subplot', 'return', 'Ronald', 'McGorvey', 'home', 'mother', 'serving', 'time', 'jail', 'convicted', 'sex', 'offender', 'buzz', 'return', 'heard', 'neighborhood', 'committee', 'formed', 'protest', 'presence', 'McGorvey', 'seemingly', 'just', 'get', 'life', 'rid', 'problem', 'trouble', 'letting', 'go', 'own', 'past', 'one', 'reason', 'being', 'people', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'him.Little', 'Children', 'asking', 'sympathize', 'empathize', 'striking', 'attempting', 'be', 'too', 'forgiving', 'understanding', 'Little', 'Children', 'psychological', 'drama', 'haunting', 'long', 'heartrending', 'ending', 'worn', 'away', 'film', 'question', 'Ronald', 'only', 'monster', 'tale', 'woe', 'where', 'adults', 'left', 'own', 'devices', 'can', 'wreak', 'kind', 'havoc', 'would', 'send', 'ripples', 'neighborhood', 'know', 'know', 'birds', 'feather', 'flock', 'together', 'what', 'cost', 'Little', 'Children', 'ponder', 'other', 'heavy', 'subjects']",N/A

Brad and Sarah friendship has profound disorientation for both; yet it's also their salvation, a curiosity, a fresh excitement, needing each others company just to feel alive!Strange mix of love and hate going on in this film, the title, Little Children doesn't just refer to the young, instead applies to all ages. All characters show there childlike vulnerability. The pedophile Ronald McGorvey (Jackie Haley) being the prime example portraying him in this film as childlike and living with his mother, trying to bring a sympathetic side to a much-hated character, which was always going to be a tall order for any actor to pull off. But Jackie Haley does put in a powerful performance quite a few haunting scenes like when his lowering himself into the children's shallows of a packed pool with mask and flippers in tow causing complete panic and another scene where his mother sets him up on a dinner date, the results are just halloweeny; creepy and an excruciating embarrassment for all.Summing up : Great Casting; all performances were strong Kate Winslet marvelous performance in this beautiful shot film. It ticks over nicely scene by scene, the narrator voice for me was the most annoying part, I found it far too monotone. overall It's a film about private addictions, secrecy and denials; enjoyable dark comedy, I'd give it three and a half stars; worth watching.Andrea Bowhill",3,"It's the hunger, the hunger for an alternative, refusal to accept a life of unhappiness.",1256947200,"10 31, 2009",2009,2962,"['Tom', 'Perrotta', 'Little', 'Children', 'been', 'adapted', 'screen', 'Tom', 'Fields', 'directors', 'chair', 'black', 'comedy', 'viewers', 'world', 'suburban', 'secrets', 'sexual', 'paranoia', 'midlife', 'crisis', 'where', 'damaged', 'self-esteem', 'hangs', 'thread', 'acts', 'desperation', 'unfold', 'films', 'provide', 'are', 'also', 'plenty', 'shocks', 'serious', 'factors', 'grown-ups', 'try', 'save', 'own', 'lives', 'sense', 'worth', 'protection', 'own', 'young', 'children', 'will', 'never', 'fail', 'even', 'bigger', 'fear', 'hangs', 'whole', 'community', 'sex', 'offender', 'mists.A', 'narrator', 'talks', 'bigger', 'picture', 'letting', 'know', 'characters', 'thoughts', 'feelings', 'shifting', 'viewpoints', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Sarah', 'women', 'small', 'daughter', 'husband', 'marketing', 'executive', 'also', 'secret', 'enthusiast', 'internet', 'porn', 'Sarah', 'had', 'felt', 'sometime', 'disenchanted', 'everything', 'life', 'husband', 'uptight', 'small', 'minded', 'moms', 'towns', 'playground', ""'d"", 'fallen', 'just', 'marking', 'time', 'Sarah', 'deliberately', 'up', 'flirtatious', 'friendship', 'Brad', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'stay', 'home', 'dad', 'known', 'other', 'playground', 'moms', 'Prom', 'King.Brad', 'caught', 'up', 'own', 'failures', 'life', 'hoping', 'become', 'lawyer', 'had', 'so', 'far', 'failed', 'bar', 'exam', 'twice', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'had', 'own', 'career', 'success', 'inferior', 'just', 'living', 'shadow', 'Uncertain', 'what', 'Brad', 'day', 'busy', 'looking', 'young', 'son', 'also', 'campaign', 'local', 'pedophile', 'Brad', 'Sarah', 'friendship', 'profound', 'disorientation', 'also', 'salvation', 'curiosity', 'fresh', 'excitement', 'needing', 'others', 'company', 'just', 'feel', 'alive', 'Strange', 'mix', 'love', 'hate', 'going', 'film', 'title', 'Little', 'Children', ""n't"", 'just', 'refer', 'young', 'instead', 'applies', 'ages', 'characters', 'show', 'there', 'childlike', 'vulnerability', 'pedophile', 'Ronald', 'McGorvey', 'Jackie', 'Haley', 'being', 'prime', 'example', 'portraying', 'film', 'childlike', 'living', 'mother', 'trying', 'bring', 'sympathetic', 'side', 'much-hated', 'character', 'was', 'always', 'going', 'be', 'tall', 'order', 'actor', 'pull', 'off', 'Jackie', 'Haley', 'put', 'powerful', 'performance', 'quite', 'few', 'haunting', 'scenes', 'when', 'lowering', 'children', 'shallows', 'packed', 'pool', 'mask', 'flippers', 'tow', 'causing', 'complete', 'panic', 'scene', 'where', 'mother', 'up', 'dinner', 'date', 'results', 'are', 'just', 'halloweeny', 'creepy', 'excruciating', 'embarrassment', 'all.Summing', 'up', 'Great', 'Casting', 'performances', 'were', 'strong', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'marvelous', 'performance', 'beautiful', 'shot', 'film', 'over', 'nicely', 'scene', 'scene', 'narrator', 'voice', 'was', 'most', 'annoying', 'part', 'found', 'far', 'too', 'monotone', 'overall', 'film', 'private', 'addictions', 'secrecy', 'denials', 'enjoyable', 'dark', 'comedy', ""'d"", 'give', 'three', 'half', 'stars', 'worth', 'watching.Andrea', 'Bowhill']",N/A
1052920,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000N3SU92,Andrew Ellington,"[5, 6]","When I first read Tom Perrotta's novel of the same name I was blown away with the power within subtlety.  The novel effortlessly takes you through suburban life and teaches valuable lessons about ourselves that, if left to the untrained eye, we might miss.  When sitting down to watch this movie I was hit with mixed reviews, some lauding, some hating, others somewhere in the middle and so honestly I didn't know what to expect.  The lady at the check out line at the movie store told me point blank that this movie was a horrible waste of time and so I kindly told her that I'd make that decision for myself.  I strongly disagree with her, so much so that I'm willing to argue this to be the finest film of this past year with anyone who dares to tango.  Todd Field brilliantly captures the very essence of Perrotta's novel and delivers with flying colors.  Yes, as some have already mentioned including critics, the film adaptation does trim down some of the side plots like those including Sarah's husband Richard and Larry the obsessed cop, but it still manages to bring to life the vision that Perrotta created.The film follows an affair that sparks up between Sarah, played effortlessly by the brilliance that is Kate Winslet, and Brad, played by breakout star Patrick Wilson.  The two of them make for an unlikely pair.  Sarah is not your typical suburban mother.  She's reserved, intelligent, earthy and plain, and Brad is your typical jock, good looking, popular and way out of her league.  But what makes their relationship so brilliant is that they are both missing something in their lives that the other can effortlessly fill.  Sarah needs a man that shows an interest in her and in her daughter, someone to make her feel pretty and needed.  Brad needs a woman that is less concerned with success and more concerned with happiness and that is willing to put his needs above her own.  Sarah's husband Richard is more interested in women he finds online and Brad's wife Kathy, played brilliantly by Jennifer Connelly, may be beautiful but she lacks interest in her what her husband really wants, always pushing him to complete a bar exam he isn't even sure he ever really wanted to pass in the first place.Their affair starts slowly.  They meet in a park and share a kiss that was meant to mean nothing but that stirred a fire in both of them.  Brad visits the playground everyday hoping to find Sarah but she's not there.  Eventually, though, they meet again at the local pool where they begin their life away from home, living as a couple in complete comforts with one another, innocent and sweet and well intentioned.  They make each other feel good without pushing the envelope and feeling guilty.  That is until one rainy afternoon when they make love while their children sleep and its forms a bond within them they can't break.  Todd Field brilliantly paints Sarah and Brad's relationship as Perrotta intentioned.  The little children spoken of in the title, while ultimately boiling down to the little ones who would control their end decisions, in a way refer to the two main characters and their actions toward one another.  Their relationship is one made in haste, in complete and utter thoughtlessness, one made without regard for those around them but, much like a child, made out of pure selfish motive.  The way they are shown interacting with one another, Sarah's brilliant reaction to Brad's winning the football game, all show the viewer that this relationship was not one out of deep rooted love but one made out of surface lust and excitement.  Sarah and Brad are back in high school experiencing that wonderful feeling for the first time and no one can take that away from them.Both Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson brilliantly capture these two lovers and effortlessly captivate their audience and dominate this picture, but there are a few supporting players that deserve recognition.  Jackie Earle Haley, who scored an Oscar nomination alongside Winslet for his role, really earns our respect and admiration.  Tackling a very difficult role he was able to invest enough sympathy and almost pathetic emotion into his very unlikable character without hesitating one bit to give us a blunt and straightforward performance.  He makes Ronny, convicted pedophile and neighborhood felon, a real person and not a stock villain, and that is a hard feat to accomplish.  Phyllis Somerville, who plays Ronny's over-protective mother, also does a brilliant job with breathing life and realistic compassion into her character.  Jennifer Connelly also blew me away with her subtle yet strong performance.  It's a performance that reminds me in ways of Michelle Williams' brilliance in last years `Brokeback Mountain'.  She was strong in a very silent and repressed sort of way, adding layers to her character with the look in her eyes and Connelly brilliantly makes herself heard without saying much at all.  The dinner scene is a prime example of her dominating a scene with the look on her face.There are a few drawbacks to the film, a major one being Noah Emmerich's corny and over-acted portrayal of Larry, the ex-cop with a personal conviction to push Ronny out of his town.  He's sorely miscast in a role that if given to the right actor and fleshed out as he was in the book could have been the standout performance but was instead trimmed back and given to an amateur to handle.  Emmerich doesn't even look the part, but that's for another discussion.  Aside from Emmerich my only problem with the film, if you can call it that, was that it let a few side plots go with just a passing glance, not really fleshing them out as they could have been.  That's understandable since this would have then turned out to be a much longer movie than ideal, but being such a huge fan of the novel I would have liked to see a few things explained a little better.  Those few drawbacks are more than made up for though and so may not even bare repeating, but I figured I should be honest.  Overall this is a very emotionally moving and rewarding movie experience, delving deep into the heart of human emotion in way that we may not even understand.  This is not a blunt and intrusive work of art made to push the envelope and prove a point in a way that's alarming or even distasteful.  It's meant to make the viewer think almost subconsciously, putting the pieces together and finding that they do fit and that this does make a lot more sense then we could have ever imagined, and it does, believe me, it does!",5,A very subtle explosion of emotions and circumstance that prove themselves very close to home...,1182729600,"06 25, 2007",2007,6525,"['When', 'first', 'read', 'Tom',

1052921,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B000N3SU92,Andy Orrock,"[13, 14]","With 'Little Children,' Todd Field has now established himself as one of this country's finest directors.  Has there been another actor (Eyes Wide Shut, Walking and Talking) in recent times that has so expertly made the transition to the other side of the lens?  As much as I liked Field's critically acclaimed debut, 'In the Bedroom,' 'Little Children' surpasses it.  Here, he teams with the Tom Perrotta, author of the novel of the same name, to craft a compelling screenplay.  And talk about establishing tone - it's gripping right from the start.Two standout scenes: the one where the convicted sex offender played by Jackie Earle Haley shows up at the neighborhood pool (a masterpiece of directorial choreography; Field and Perrotta depict sudden realization and hysteria spreading over a crowd of at least 100); and the opening scene where 'prom king' Patrick Wilson suddenly kisses Kate Winslet in the park (that moment and the immediate reaction of the nattering Moms is pitch-perfect).Kate Winslet justly got an Oscar nomination for her portrayal; and Film Critic circles heaped just praise on the back-from-unjust-oblivion performance of Jackie Earle Haley.  But I wonder why Patrick Wilson constantly got overlooked?  A favorite of mine since his breakout in Mike Nichols' HBO adaptation of 'Angels in America,' he's superlative here.  To a lesser extent, the same goes for character actor Noah Emmerich, who is really great as the coming-apart-at-the-seams ex-cop Larry Hedges.And much of the success of getting the tone and scope of the novel fit into a movie has to go to Will Lyman, who provides some critical narration.  Narrators often don't work at all, but Lyman's voice and intonation lend both gravitas and a knowing little smirk.  He's best known for being the voice of TV's Frontline.  His voice here on 'Children' grabs you right away.  It makes you pay attention to every word.

1052924,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000N3SU92,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[1, 8]","***SPOILER ALERT***Like Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening in Sam Mendes' AMERICAN BEAUTY, director Todd Field's (STRANGER THAN FICTION) latest take on American suburbia hits hard the great flaws that define the human condition of our current generation. Replacing Spacey and Bening this time, though, are Kate Winslet (THE HOLIDAY) and Patrick Wilson (HARD CANDY).Bored nearly to catatonia, Sarah Pierce (Winslett) finds the affections of Brad Adamson (Wilson) pretty much irresistible. Brad, a stay at home dad with an overbearing wife (played by Jennifer Connelly, DARK WATER), visits the local playground with his young son, much to the excitement of the stroller-pushing mothers in the area (he's quite the hunk.) As he and Sarah's relationship grows, they do more and more to hide it from their friends and family. Sarah also begins to despise taking care of her own child, while Brad feels the guilt of what he's doing to his family (not to mention his multiple failures to pass the bar exam.)When Brad and Sarah decide to leave their spouses (and maybe even their kids), the trauma is physical and emotional. Both realize that they're acting like ""little children,"" not taking life serious enough. But at the same time both want to act that way, to be young again, reclaim their youth, be more vibrant. Brad realizes he can't do it after a skull-crunching skateboard accident, while Sarah's inherent mothering instincts take over when her little girl disappears during a late night rendevous with Brad.Surrounding these two are their friends, family, neighbors, and a recently paroled child stalker named Ronnie (Jackie Earle Haley). It is Ronnie that gives the entire film its much needed impact, for every scene he's in contains moments of sheer disgust and parental horror (his masturbatory behavior outside a playground will be enough to send shivers up one's spine).

I could identify with the feelings of some of the characters and their often self-destructive choices made them very human.  While I do think the movie does a fine job of this as well, I didn't like how it diverged from the book.  The changes weren't hugely significant but they were enough to make me feel that the movie was a much less satisfying experience than the book.I was particularly disappointed with the changes in Sarah.  As in the book, she is often self absorbed and absent with her child but I felt the book provided more of an explanation--though not necessarily a justification--of her actions.  Her husband is barely evident in the movie and I think the dynamic of their marriage as expressed in the book goes a long way towards explaining what makes Sarah who she is.  In the movie she's portrayed more as a woman dissatisfied with being a stay-at-home mom.  While this was also the case in the book, she also had a crumbling marriage with which to contend.  I felt the movie made her out to be more of a villain and less a victim of circumstance.  Though I did like the idea of her recognizing at long last just how much her child meant to her, I thought the movie as a whole did her character a great deal of disservice.In spite of this, I still admired the film for its fine acting.  I particularly liked the scene in which Sarah explained her views of Madame Bovary to her book club and then, as she realized how akin she was to the character, the prickling of her conscience and her sense of guilt is made very evident by the slightest of winces.  Winslet is a superb actress and even though I initially thought her too pretty to play Sarah, she took the character and made it her own.The scene at the pool is also superb and uncomfortably visceral.  Though Ronnie does nothing more than swim around, it's an extremely icky scene that, as a parent, made me squirm.  Haley did a really fine job of portraying Ronnie, making him an obviously disturbed human being for whom it is possible to feel some twinges of sympathy.  Rather than his simply being a one-dimensional monster, the character is very nuanced and complex.Brad is perfectly portrayed by Wilson and though Connelly is a good actress, there's not much for her to do in this film other than nag her husband.  Wilson plays Brad is a man who hasn't quite grown up and accepted responsibility but, on the flip side, it's also easy to see why there is tension between him and his wife given that she's prone to treating their son as more of an adult than her husband.",3,Not quite as good as the book,1196121600,"11 27, 2007",2007,2595,"['When', 'read', 'novel', 'really', 'spoke', 'could', 'identify', 'feelings', 'characters', 'often', 'self-destructive', 'choices', 'made', 'very', 'human', 'do', 'think', 'movie', 'fine', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'how', 'diverged', 'book', 'changes', 'were', ""n't"", 'hugely', 'significant', 'were', 'enough', 'make', 'feel', 'movie', 'was', 'much', 'less', 'satisfying', 'experience', 'book.I', 'was', 'particularly', 'disappointed', 'changes', 'Sarah', 'book', 'often', 'self', 'absorbed', 'absent', 'child', 'felt', 'book', 'provided', 'more', 'explanation', 'not', 'necessarily', 'justification', 'actions', 'husband', 'barely', 'evident', 'movie', 'think', 'dynamic', 'marriage', 'expressed', 'book', 'long', 'way', 'explaining', 'what', 'Sarah', 'who', 'movie', 'portrayed', 'more', 'woman', 'dissatisfied', 'being', 'stay-at-home', 'mom', 'was', 'also', 'case', 'book', 'also', 'had', 'crumbling', 'marriage', 'contend', 'felt', 'movie', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'more', 'villain', 'less', 'victim', 'circumstance', 'did', 'idea', 'recognizing', 'long', 'last', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'child', 'meant', 'thought', 'movie', 'whole', 'did', 'character', 'great', 'deal', 'disservice.In', 'spite', 'still', 'admired', 'film', 'fine', 'acting', 'particularly', 'liked', 'scene', 'Sarah', 'explained', 'views', 'Madame', 'Bovary', 'book', 'club', 'then', 'realized', 'how', 'akin', 'was', 'character', 'prickling', 'conscience', 'sense', 'guilt', 'made', 'very', 'evident', 'slightest', 'winces', 'Winslet', 'superb', 'actress', 'even', 'initially', 'thought', 'too', 'pretty', 'play', 'Sarah', 'took', 'character', 'made', 'own.The', 'scene', 'pool', 'also', 'superb', 'uncomfortably', 'visceral', 'Ronnie', 'nothing', 'more', 'swim', 'extremely', 'icky', 'scene', 'parent', 'made', 'squirm', 'Haley', 'did', 'really', 'fine', 'job', 'portraying', 'Ronnie', 'making', 'obviously', 'disturbed', 'human', 'being', 'whom', 'possible', 'feel', 'twinges', 'sympathy', 'Rather', 'simply', 'being', 'one-dimensional', 'monster', 'character', 'very', 'nuanced', 'complex.Brad', 'perfectly', 'portrayed', 'Wilson', 'Connelly', 'good', 'actress', 'not', 'much', 'do', 'film', 'other', 'husband', 'Wilson', 'Brad', 'man', 'who', ""n't"", 'quite', 'grown', 'up', 'accepted', 'responsibility', 'flip', 'side', 'also', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'tension', 'wife', 'given', 'prone', 'treating', 'son', 'more', 'adult', 'husband']",N/A

However, my concerns were the same as always when it comes to big screen adaptations of any novel:  will they do it justice?With that said and done, I can say yes and no.  Yes, the pathos and sense of despair these ""desperate housewives"" feel  is finely brought to the screen and No, some liberties were taken with the second half of the film which veered away from the novel.  It changed the complex simplicity of the story and hampered the quiet outcome of the ending.  It wasn't until I heard a couple of people in front of me grumble ""That's not how it ended in the book,"" that I realized they were right.My two beefs with Little Children were 1) the Mary Ann character was played as a smug self-righteous right winged Republican without delving into her story and how her rigid schedules of sex at 9pm on Tuesdays and snack time at 10am exactly were disintegrating her perfect-on-the-surface marriage and 2) I didn't quite like how an ""example"" needed to be made of Ronnie, the pedophile.  His crime was much more severe in the novel than the movie but his ""punishment"" in the movie was much more severe and grossly over-the-top than the novel.Liberties and beefs aside, Little Children is a fairly entertaining film.

Loveless marriages, struggles with self worth and identity crisis and other various forms and levels of doubt and depression are cleverly dealt with in this thoughtful and entertaining film. Most of the communal angst lays dormant until a convicted child molester returns to the neighborhood to live with his Mother. His presence inflames the passions of the community and brings to the surface a myriad of personal problems that may have otherwise remained unnoticed.`Little Children' is quality adult drama with a stellar cast which includes; Kate Winslet, Patrick Wilson, Jennifer Connelly and Jackie Earle Haley. The storyline contains an ingenious blend of genres, it's at times comedic, other times erotic and still other times shockingly lurid, but always fascinating, cutting edge entertainment. It also includes an intermittent narration reminiscent of the old television series `Wonder Years.' It's not something I would expect to work but it actually does, adding depth to the characterizations and pointing out some of the subtler nuanances in the storyline that may have been otherwise missed.Note: `Little Children' contains nudity, sexual situations and deviant behavior so if you're offended by such material be forwarned.My rating: 4  Stars.",4,"""Please Be A Good Boy"" ~ Prom Kings, Perverts & A Plethora Of Personal Problems",1179014400,"05 13, 2007",2007,1414,"[""'06"", 'motion', 'picture', 'release', 'Little', 'Children', 'story', 'dysfunctional', 'life', 'seething', 'beautiful', 'seemingly', 'tranquil', 'suburban', 'community', 'Loveless', 'marriages', 'struggles', 'self', 'worth', 'identity', 'crisis', 'other', 'various', 'forms', 'levels', 'doubt', 'depression', 'are', 'cleverly', 'dealt', 'thoughtful', 'entertaining', 'film', 'Most', 'communal', 'angst', 'dormant', 'convicted', 'child', 'molester', 'returns', 'neighborhood', 'live', 'Mother', 'presence', 'passions', 'community', 'surface', 'myriad', 'personal', 'problems', 'may', 'have', 'otherwise', 'remained', 'unnoticed.', 'Little', 'Children', 'quality', 'adult', 'drama', 'stellar', 'cast', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'Jackie', 'Earle', 'Haley', 'storyline', 'ingenious', 'blend', 'genres', 'times', 'comedic', 'other', 'times', 'erotic', 'still', 'other', 'times', 'shockingly', 'lurid', 'always', 'fascinating', 'cutting', 'edge', 'entertainment', 'also', 'intermittent', 'narration', 'reminiscent', 'old', 'television', 'series', 'Wonder', 'Years', 'not', 'something', 'would', 'expect', 'work', 'actually', 'adding', 'depth', 'characterizations', 'pointing', 'out', 'subtler', 'nuanances', 'storyline', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'otherwise', 'missed.Note', 'Little', 'Children', 'contains', 'nudity', 'sexual', 'situations', 'deviant', 'behavior', 'so', ""'re"", 'offended', 'such', 'material', 'be', 'forwarned.My', 'rating', '4', 'Stars']",N/A

It's about the things we hide, the perceptions we have and the reasons for it all.It's about the married couple who don't talk. It's about the married couple who's wife works too much. It's about the convincted pedifile and his presence in the neighborhood. It's about the ex-cop who is haunted by one very very wrong decision.Ultimately, LITTLE CHILDREN, relies heavily on the actors and their abilities to bring us into the characters. There are pluses and there are minuses. First of all, Jackie Earl Haley who plays Ronnie J. McGorvey, hit it out of the park. His deamenor throughout the film is spot on. His scene at the end of the blind date is gut churning, shocking and you feel the uncomfortable feeling that Sheila (Jane Adams) has been put into.There is a minus though. Kate Winslett was outstanding delving into the character and the emotional state of Sarah Pierce. Sarah is a plain Jane. She's the girl who watched as all the other pretty girls get the notoriety. She doesn't see herself as pretty or sexual. In fact, she isn't... or at least, she isn't supposed to be. The problem is. Kate Winslett is beautiful.

Kids will love it, especially fans of Titanic who get to see Kate Winslet again, or tykes who loved Angels in America who get to see the guy who is hilarious in that movie.  But adults--be warned--this is a snooze fest!It's a film about Kate Winslet who falls in love with a father in the park (this is called a ""meet cute"" in film language), but then the movie kind of peters out after that.  I'm all for love stories and for films about people relaxing by a pool, but come on...could we get a little depth for the grown-ups?In summation, this is great if you want to plop the kids down in front of the TV for a few hours--although the TV should never be used as a de facto babysitter--but adults should know that this would be a great time to organize their recycling, or label their spices, or dustbust.",1,Not as Good as Aladdin,1177891200,"04 30, 2007",2007,1090,"['What', 'great', 'days', 'make', 'children', 'movies', 'Aladdin', 'Shrek', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'kids', 'can', 'enjoy', 'also', 'have', 'adult', 'sense', 'humor', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'bored', 'tears', 'have', 'bring', 'kids', 'along.Little', 'Children', 'not', 'one', 'movies', 'however', 'Kids', 'will', 'love', 'especially', 'fans', 'Titanic', 'who', 'get', 'see', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'again', 'tykes', 'who', 'loved', 'Angels', 'America', 'who', 'get', 'see', 'guy', 'who', 'hilarious', 'movie', 'adults', 'be', 'warned', 'snooze', 'fest', 'film', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'who', 'love', 'father', 'park', 'called', 'meet', 'cute', 'film', 'language', 'then', 'movie', 'kind', 'peters', 'out', ""'m"", 'love', 'stories', 'films', 'people', 'relaxing', 'pool', 'come', 'could', 'get', 'little', 'depth', 'grown-ups', 'summation', 'great', 'want', 'plop', 'kids', 'down', 'front', 'TV', 'few', 'hours', 'TV', 'should', 'never', 'be', 'used', 'de', 'facto', 'babysitter', 'adults', 'should', 'know', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'time', 'organize', 'recycling', 'label', 'spices', 'dustbust']",N/A
1052936,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000N3SU92,"Cloud ""...""","[4, 4]","Films like Little Children almost seem tailor-made to be played at home. It's not really an insult and films like this can't play with the big boys but you almost appreciate a smaller film like this more when it's just you and the movie and not some independent film in danger of being crushed by a bigger film. It's a full-blown character study with no action sequences and for many people, that's just fine. With top acting across the board, 2 compelling stories and a comfortable pacing, this is one of those films that you'll appreciate more in your living room than on the big screen.Sarah is a suburban housewife unhappily married to Richard, an advertising executive who is obsessed with a porn website and the model featured on it. During her trips to the neighborhood park, she sees a stay-at-home dad named Brad who other women dub ""the Prom King"". On a bet, Sarah goes and talks to him which ends up sparking a longing and subsequently an affair that they have to hide from Richard, the townspeople and Kathy, Brad's documentary maker wife. In the other main story, Ronald McGovney, a convicted young sex offender (arrested for exposure to a minor) moves into the neighborhood which has the town in an uproar, brought on the most by Larry, a former cop. While unhealthy mentally, he does have a caring relationship with his mother and all these stories connect as some want to be child again while others do serious things in a childlike manner.What helps the movie considerably is its tone. The idea of a pedophile makes for some pretty stark subject matter yet at the same time there's some moments of comedy, largely brought on by narrator Will Lyman, who narrates as if he's telling the film like a mystery novel unfolding. But this is basically a character story so it's got a more leisurely pacing that some might not be accustomed to. Yet at the same time it manages to be funny without comical or satirical and serious without being accessible. One scene is quite the highlight when Ronnie enters the town pool and basically scuba dives in-between the swimming kids legs. It seems like a scene straight out of Hitchcock and it's quite gripping (but what's with all those people around the edge, was there really that many parents?) The film's main problem though is the ending since it just feels like it sputters and does that little engine sputtering sound. It starts out well enough but then it just kind of dies.The acting on the other hand is all around fantastic. The highlight of course is Kate Winslet who manages to be serious and smart while delivering that longing and want for someone else. Jackie Earle Haley playing Ronnie is also a great find, who has that off-kilter presence yet for some reason, there's some humanity you see...that is until he does something heartbreaking to a woman on a date. The rest of the cast is fine such as Patrick Wilson playing Brad but other characters like Jennifer Connelly playing Kathy feels underwritten. One subplot that feels out of place though has a good performance behind it with Noel Emmerich (Jim Carrey's buddy in the Truman Show). There's a dramatic weight to his story but the other 2 are so interesting that his seems kind of unnecessary.The special features are a travesty. There's literally nothing, not even its well-handled trailer. Look for a special edition in the future but I recommend you rent the film not because it's strictly a rental but the film's so good yet those looking for more of a hefty feel to the thing might want to wait.",5,One of the year's overlooked movies,1178409600,"05 6, 2007",2007,3527,"['Films', 'Little', 'Children', 'almost', 'seem', 'tailor-made', 'be', 'played', 'home', 'not', 'really', 'insult', 'films', 'ca', ""n't"", 'play', 'big', 'boys', 'almost', 'appreciate', 'smaller', 'film', 'more', 'when', 'just', 'movie', 'not', 'independent', 'film', 'danger', 'being', 'crushed', 'bigger', 'film', 'full-blown', 'character', 'study', 'action', 'sequences', 'many', 'people', 'just', 'fine', 'top', 'acting', 'board', '2', 'compelling', 'stories', 'comfortable', 'pacing', 'one', 'films', ""'ll"", 'appreciate', 'more', 'living', 'room', 'big', 'screen.Sarah', 'suburban', 'housewife', 'unhappily', 'married', 'Richard', 'advertising', 'executive', 'who', 'obsessed', 'porn', 'website', 'model', 'featured', 'trips', 'neighborhood', 'park', 'stay-at-home', 'dad', 'named', 'Brad', 'who', 'other', 'women', 'Prom', 'King', 'bet', 'Sarah', 'talks', 'up', 'sparking', 'longing', 'subsequently', 'affair', 'have', 'hide', 'Richard', 'townspeople', 'Kathy', 'Brad', 'documentary', 'maker', 'wife', 'other', 'main', 'story', 'Ronald', 'McGovney', 'convicted', 'young', 'sex', 'offender', 'arrested', 'exposure', 'minor', 'neighborhood', 'town', 'uproar', 'brought', 'most', 'Larry', 'former', 'cop', 'unhealthy', 'mentally', 'have', 'caring', 'relationship', 'mother', 'stories', 'connect', 'want', 'be', 'child', 'again', 'others', 'do', 'serious', 'things', 'childlike', 'movie', 'considerably', 'tone', 'idea', 'pedophile', 'pretty', 'stark', 'subject', 'matter', 'yet', 'same', 'time', 'moments', 'comedy', 'largely', 'brought', 'narrator', 'Will', 'Lyman', 'who', 'telling', 'film', 'mystery', 'novel', 'unfolding', 'basically', 'character', 'story', 'got', 'more', 'leisurely', 'pacing', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'accustomed', 'same', 'time', 'be', 'funny', 'comical', 'satirical', 'serious', 'being', 'accessible', 'One', 'scene', 'quite', 'highlight', 'when', 'Ronnie', 'town', 'pool', 'basically', 'scuba', 'dives', 'in-between', 'swimming', 'kids', 'legs', 'scene', 'straight', 'Hitchcock', 'quite', 'gripping', 'what', 'people', 'edge', 'was', 'really', 'many', 'parents', 'film', 'main', 'problem', 'though', 'ending', 'just', 'feels', 'sputters', 'little', 'engine', 'sputtering', 'sound', 'out', 'well', 'enough', 'then', 'just', 'kind', 'dies.The', 'acting', 'other', 'hand', 'fantastic', 'highlight', 'course', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'who', 'be', 'serious', 'smart', 'delivering', 'longing', 'want', 'someone', 'else', 'Jackie', 'Earle', 'Haley', 'playing', 'Ronnie', 'also', 'great', 'find', 'who', 'off-kilter', 'presence', 'yet', 'reason', 'humanity', 'see', 'something', 'heartbreaking', 'woman', 'date', 'rest', 'cast', 'fine', 'such', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'playing', 'Brad', 'other', 'characters', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'playing', 'Kathy', 'feels', 'underwritten', 'One', 'subplot', 'place', 'though', 'good', 'performance', 'Noel', 'Emmerich', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'buddy', 'Truman', 'Show', 'dramatic', 'weight', 'story', 'other', '2', 'are', 'so', 'interesting', 'kind', 'unnecessary.The', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'travesty', 'literally', 'nothing', 'not', 'even', 'well-handled', 'trailer', 'Look', 'special', 'edition', 'future', 'recommend', 'rent', 'film', 'not', 'strictly', 'rental', 'film', 'so', 'good', 'yet', 'looking', 'more', 'hefty', 'feel', 'thing', 'might', 'want', 'wait']",N/A
1052937,A3J5UO5QMTFSWB,B000N3SU92,"Connoisseur Rat ""armchair experientialist""","[6, 6]","In the squirmingly shameless gloomy human comedy ""Little Children"", co-writer/director Todd Field tries his darnedest to steal the trophy away from Todd Solondz (""Storytelling"", ""Happiness"") in the coveted race for the Best American Filmmaker of Unflinching Tragicomedies (Named Todd) Award.  (In that sense, I guess it's no accident that Jane Adams shows up once again to get a heartwrenchingly hilarious comeuppance).With all of the buzz about Jackie Earle Haley's Oscar-Nominated Supporting performance as pedophile Ronald McGorvey, I was surprised to find that his subplot accounted for merely twenty percent (or so) of the film.  The main action concerns two restless, adulterous stay-at-home parents (although I guess the term ""stray-at-home parents"" might be more apt in this case).Reluctant-seeming mom Sarah Pierce (Kate Winslet, always stellar) whiles away the minutes of her day at the park, mixing company with a cadre of aggressively-judgmental moms, some of whom seem like grown up Mean Girls.  Kate tries to ease the pain of socializing with them by pretending she's ""an anthropologist observing the behavior of typical suburban women.""The greatly-underrated Patrick Wilson plays Brad Anderson, who the Mean Moms refer to as ""the Prom King"" whenever he graces them with his park presence.  Brad is an insecure, stray-at-home dad with an almost pathological need for approval.As Sarah catches her older husband in a panty-faced act of internet infidelity, and Brad's wife Kathy (the wonderful Jennifer Connolly) is a condescending, micromanaging cold fish of a wife (who wins the family breadcrumbs as a PBS documentarian and reads books with such jaunty titles as ""Children of Grief"" in bed at night), it is perhaps inevitable that both Brad and Sarah choose to fill the voids in their lives with each other, even though she has ""eyebrows that were thicker than Brad thought necessary.""  It also helps that their kids are the same age, I suppose.All of this is tied together via a weird but surprisingly whimsical voiceover narrator (he's the one who supplies the two above quotes about the anthropologist and the eyebrows), with a boomingly dispassionate, ultra-serious voice which reminds me of that NFL films announcer who so famously describes ""the frozen tundra of Lambeau Field"" on ESPN.  (This similarity comes in handy later when he does the play by play on Brad's big touch football championship game.)As Brad and Sarah begin to live their stray at home lives in earnest, and become more needy towards one another, the tension builds to a boil as they still must maintain the faade of a normal, happily-married life.  This prove quite difficult to do at a dinner party with all in attendance.Halfway through the movie, the film is so kind as to provide commentary on itself in the guise of a Madame Bovary book group meeting.  Sarah, who had studied the book in grad school, proclaims that while she once felt disdain for the main character, she now sees ""something beautiful and even heroic in her rebellion"" and ""the hunger for an alternative and the refusal to accept a life of unhappiness.""  Well of course you do, Sarah!  Though a bit too meta for my tastes, this scene does provide somewhat of a poignant exposition for Sarah's desperate behavior.Meanwhile, the subplot involving child predator McGorvey is mercifully protracted.  I say that because, even though the scenes with his unconditionally-loving mom (Phyllis Somerville) are nicely moving, and even though McGorvey himself adds to the ""trapped in a prison made of our own desire"" theme of the overall piece, the unhinged ex-cop who keeps a maniacal watch on him (hyperactively played by Noah Emmerich) is so over the top that I think even Will Ferrell might have played him with more restraint.  This is the only truly false note in the movie for me and is what keeps it from a five-star rating.Aside from that, the writing is crisp, the acting is inspired, and the cinematography and score both lush and understated at the same time.  There are some lovely moments of symbolism involving fragile porcelain clocks fashioned to resemble children and a nice symbolic synopsis of the human condition, as Sarah's daughter wanders off to stare up into a moth-swarmed streetlight.  It makes us wonder: are we all biologically wired to stray, to constantly be looking toward the light?In all, ""Little Children"" is a slightly flawed but richly rewarding look at the untidiness of the human experience, and how sometimes we can mask our self-serving agendas as being ""for the children"" when they're really just about ourselves.",4,A Slightly Flawed But Richly Rewarding Look at the Untidiness of the Human Experience,1173657600,"03 12, 2007",2007,4608,"['squirmingly', 'shameless', 'gloomy', 'human', 'comedy', 'Little', 'Children', 'co-writer/director', 'Todd', 'Field', 'darnedest', 'steal', 'trophy', 'away', 'Todd', 'Solondz', 'Storytelling', 'Happiness', 'coveted', 'race', 'Best', 'American', 'Filmmaker', 'Unflinching', 'Tragicomedies', 'Named', 'Todd', 'Award', 'sense', 'guess', 'accident', 'Jane', 'Adams', 'up', 'once', 'again', 'get', 'heartwrenchingly', 'hilarious', 'comeuppance', 'buzz', 'Jackie', 'Earle', 'Haley', 'Oscar-Nominated', 'Supporting', 'performance', 'pedophile', 'Ronald', 'McGorvey', 'was', 'surprised', 'find', 'subplot', 'accounted', 'merely', 'twenty', 'percent', 'so', 'film', 'main', 'action', 'concerns', 'two', 'restless', 'adulterous', 'stay-at-home', 'parents', 'guess', 'term', 'stray-at-home', 'parents', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'apt', 'case', '.Reluctant-seeming', 'mom', 'Sarah', 'Pierce', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'always', 'stellar', 'away', 'minutes', 'day', 'park', 'mixing', 'company', 'cadre', 'aggressively-judgmental', 'moms', 'whom', 'seem', 'grown', 'up', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'Kate', 'ease', 'pain', 'socializing', 'pretending', 'anthropologist', 'observing', 'behavior', 'typical', 'suburban', 'women', 'greatly-underrated', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'Brad', 'Anderson', 'who', 'Mean', 'Moms', 'refer', 'Prom', 'King', 'whenever', 'park', 'presence', 'Brad', 'insecure', 'stray-at-home', 'dad', 'almost', 'pathological', 'need', 'approval.As', 'Sarah', 'older', 'husband', 'panty-faced', 'act', 'internet', 'infidelity', 'Brad', 'wife', 'Kathy', 'wonderful', 'Jennifer', 'Connolly', 'condescending', 'micromanaging', 'cold', 'fish', 'wife', 'who', 'family', 'PBS', 'documentarian', 'reads', 'books', 'such', 'jaunty', 'titles', 'Children', 'Grief', 'bed', 'night', 'perhaps', 'inevitable', 'Brad', 'Sarah', 'choose', 'fill', 'voids', 'lives', 'other', 'even', 'eyebrows', 'were', 'thicker', 'Brad', 'thought', 'necessary', 'also', 'kids', 'are', 'same', 'age', 'suppose.All', 'tied', 'together', 'weird', 'surprisingly', 'whimsical', 'voiceover', 'narrator', 'one', 'who', 'two', 'quotes', 'anthropologist', 'eyebrows', 'boomingly', 'dispassionate', 'ultra-serious', 'voice', 'NFL', 'films', 'announcer', 'who', 'so', 'famously', 'frozen', 'tundra', 'Lambeau', 'Field', 'ESPN', 'similarity', 'handy', 'later', 'when', 'play', 'play', 'Brad', 'big', 'touch', 'football', 'championship', 'game', 'Brad', 'Sarah', 'begin', 'live', 'stray', 'home', 'lives', 'earnest', 'become', 'more', 'needy', 'towards', 'one', 'tension', 'boil', 'still', 'must', 'maintain', 'faade', 'normal', 'happily-married', 'life', 'prove', 'quite', 'difficult', 'do', 'dinner', 'party', 'attendance.Halfway', 'movie', 'film', 'so', 'kind', 'provide', 'commentary', 'guise', 'Madame', 'Bovary', 'book', 'group', 'meeting', 'Sarah', 'who', 'had', 'studied', 'book', 'grad', 'school', 'proclaims', 'once', 'felt', 'disdain', 'main', 'character', 'now', 'something', 'beautiful', 'even', 'heroic', 'rebellion', 'hunger', 'alternative', 'refusal', 'accept', 'life', 'unhappiness', 'Well', 'course', 'do', 'Sarah', 'bit', 'too', 'meta', 'tastes', 'scene', 'provide', 'somewhat', 'poignant', 'exposition', 'Sarah', 'desperate', 'behavior.Meanwhile', 'subplot', 'involving', 'child', 'predator', 'McGorvey', 'mercifully', 'protracted', 'say', 'even', 'scenes', 'unconditionally-loving', 'mom', 'Phyllis', 'Somerville', 'are', 'nicely', 'moving', 'even', 'McGorvey', 'trapped', 'prison', 'made', 'own', 'desire', 'theme', 'overall', 'piece', 'unhinged', 'ex-cop', 'who', 'maniacal', 'watch', 'hyperactively', 'played', 'Noah', 'Emmerich', 'so', 'top', 'think', 'even', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'might', 'have', 'played', 'more', 'restraint', 'only', 'truly', 'false', 'note', 'movie', 'what', 'five-star', 'rating.Aside', 'writing', 'crisp', 'acting', 'inspired', 'cinematography', 'score', 'lush', 'understated', 'same', 'time', 'are', 'lovely', 'moments', 'symbolism', 'involving', 'fragile', 'porcelain', 'clocks', 'fashioned', 'resemble', 'children', 'nice', 'symbolic', 'synopsis', 'human', 'condition', 'Sarah', 'daughter', 'wanders', 'stare', 'up', 'moth-swarmed', 'streetlight', 'wonder', 'are', 'biologically', 'wired', 'stray', 'constantly', 'be', 'looking', 'light', 'Little', 'Children', 'slightly', 'flawed', 'richly', 'rewarding', 'look', 'untidiness', 'human', 'experience', 'how', 'sometimes', 'can', 'mask', 'self-serving', 'agendas', 'being', 'children', 'when', ""'re"", 'really', 'just', 'ourselves']",N/A

Patrick Wilson, as Winslet's paramour, is equally fine as a man in a stale marriage who has yet to commit to career choice.

Get it at Amazon.]The way director Todd Field handles human sexuality in this movie reminds me a bit of the way Todd Solondz handled it in Happiness (1998).  There are the same starkly realistic depictions of a variety of human desires, lusts and cravings with perhaps an emphasis on what devotees of the missionary position might call ""perversions.""  Although not quite as wild as Solondz's film, Little Children is equally challenging to politically correct notions of sexuality.Kate Winslet stars as Sarah Pierce, a suburban mom who has a Master's in English lit and a husband who finds sex in cyber space more satisfying than sex with her.  She joins (at a slight distance) some other more conventional suburban moms at the local playground where they sit around and talk while watching their children play.  One of the things the women talk about is Brad Adamson (Patrick Wilson), who is a handsome stay at home dad who has twice fluked the bar exam.  He takes care of his son while his high powered wife Kathy (Jennifer Connelly) is busy bringing home the bacon.  The women don't talk to him.  They watch him warily but with keen interest and call him ""the prom king.""  When Sarah catches her husband having sex with his computer (so to speak) she resolves to gain the Prom King for herself, partly out of sheer romantic lust and partly out of revenge.While we watch the adulterous union unfold, we are given some perspective in the form of Ronnie J. McGorvey (played with appropriate creepiness by Jackie Earle Haley) who has just been released from prison after serving a term for exposing himself to children.  A side complication arrives in the form of Larry Hedges (Noah Emmerich), who is a ""retired"" cop with a temper management problem and a tendency to find objects of hate onto which to direct his anger.  Ronnie the pervert becomes his target.All this seems...well, unremarkable and even tiresome except for the fact that everybody in the movie is flawed in some very serious and interesting way, and director Field's interpretation of the characters comes down resolutely on the side of the nonconventional.  In some respects what Field and Tom Perrotta, who wrote the novel from which he and Field adapted the screenplay, are saying is that the characters are all little children (hence the title).  And not only that, but we're all a bit perverse.  It just depends on your point of view.  Sarah's parenting skills are less than optimal and it's obvious that she is bored with being a stay at home mom.  Her ""perversion"" is similar to Gustav Flaubert's Madame Bovary in that she wants more out of life than being a wife and mother.  She wants, as she explains to the woman's book club, what Madame Bovary wanted, to satisfy ""the hunger - the hunger for an alternative and the refusal to accept a life of unhappiness.""Brad wants to remain a child, being taken care of by his wife, while he pretends to study for the bar exam but instead plays touch football and watches the boys at the skateboard park as though a boy himself, or allows himself to be seduced by Sarah.Ronnie wants to have sex with little girls, and Sarah's husband wants to have sex with a porn star--or perhaps they just want to masturbate to fantasies of same...and so on.What nonetheless makes this an excellent movie is first of all Kate Winslet who continues to prove she can play a wide variety of characters and get into their skin and become them as she has done in so many films.  She brings the nuances of Sarah Pierce's character, her strengths and weaknesses, to life in a vivid and compelling way that forces us to identify with her, much the same way we identify with Madame Bovary.Also first rate is the unflinching way human sexuality is presented and the refusal to accept conventionality that is the heart of this story.  I think that directors Todd Field and Todd Solondz may be working in a new genre for the 21st century that might be called ""sexual realism.""  Perhaps it is just a coincidence but both directors had Jane Adams play a kind of forlorn wallflower at the game of life in both movies.  Perhaps she symbolizes in some strange way the confused, frustrated and deeply masked phenomenon that is human sexuality.The real essence of the film is contained in the scene in which Ronnie enters the pool with all the children playing in it and the moms in the lounge chairs watching.  Suddenly Sarah becomes aware that Ronnie the pervert is in the pool and then all the other moms become aware.  There is a mass hysteria and a mass exit from the pool by the children.  The moms are horrified and are desperate to know, ""Did he touch you?""  Ronnie is seen as some kind of bug-like creature who somehow will bring a contagion upon them through his touch.  The point here and indeed throughout the film (and also in Solondz's film) is that we overreact to sex that offends us.  We find the touch of a creepy pedophile worse than some kind of physical violence.This is a thesis that will not find acceptance in America for many years to come if ever because sexual perversity is more threatening to most Americans than extreme violence.  Why this should be so is not really a mystery.  But to explain it here is beyond the scope of this review, and anyway explaining it would hardly change it.  However the fact that Field and Solandz are bringing it to our attention is something new and is perhaps the beginning of a challenge to conventional morality.",4,Sexual realism?,1240790400,"04 27,

There are those movies that just make you want to analyze them over and over again, but the problem here is that everytime I attempted to answer a question posed for the audience, I realized that we never did get those answers. Why was Jean mad at Sarah? Did Ronnie live? And what was up with Richard?Little Children should've been the smart intersection of four separate life stories all entangled in subterfuge, lost and loneliness in suburbia, but I really didn't get that. I got the mopey housewife who once had potential and, dressed, looked only a step better than Cameron Diaz in Being John Malkovich. Sarah Pierce, played by Kate Winslet, is stuck in a drole life where her husband would rather masturbate to internet porn than pay attention to her. He's on-screen long enough to be caught and then we don't see much of him, at all. Sarah's lover Brad's (Patrick Wilson) wife, played nicely be Jennifer Connely almost feels like the most talented actor in the film and isn't given much credit. Throughout she wants Brad to take the bar for the third time, but we don't know why he never passes. I suppose he doesn't want to really be a lawyer and would rather play with his son in the park or watch the local skaters. Sarah seems happy in her boring life where she absolutely nothing to worry about. (Her house is paid for and her daughter's a dear.)In a seemingly enigmatic parallel plot line, a convicted pedophile has been released from prison and moved into the neighborhood with his elderly mother. Jackie Earle Haley, former child star from The Bad News Bears, plays this predator with acidic aplomb who, at times, the audience can almost feel sorry for. He is sickening to look at, but the entire plot around the town's obsession with his arrival did nothing for the film and didn't seem to mesh with the affair Brad & Sarah begin in the local park -- other than the obvious link between lust & playground antics.It seemed that whenever Tood Fields wasn't sure how to show a scene, he just decided not to. Instead he had some faceless narrator tell the audience what was about to happen, and by doing so, treated us as if we weren't intelligent enought to figure it out for ourselves. Unfortunately for Sarah, Ronnie, and for us, Fields dropped his voice over narration toward the crucial end, where he left us high and dry.

I loved Tom Perrota's book ""Election"" and the movie that was made into it. I haven't read ""Little Children,"" but I wish I had. I'm sure that the majestic filmmaking, the slow moving story, and the subtlety of life would read just as good, if not better, than the movie.The story centers around a sleepy Massachusetts town, in the suburbs. Sarah, who never seemed to want motherhood in the first place, goes through the motions day by day, counting the minutes until her husband comes home so she can get a ""minute of peace."" Her husband Richard spends most of his time locked in his office. He pretends to work, but cruises the internet for ""Slutty Kay"" instead. Brad is a stay at home dad, taking the Bar every year, while his wife Kathy makes documentaries. He is dubbed ""The Prom King,"" by the neighborhood mothers, yet they won't speak to him. We also meet Ronald, the pedophile who exposed himself to a neighborhood child. After prison, he comes back home to live with his mother. Larry, an ex-cop, with a few screw ups under his own belt, spends his time terrorizing Ronald by driving by his house with a bull horn 5-6 times a night.When Sarah is bet 5 dollars to get Brad's phone number, she hugs him instead. When he kisses her to scare away the moms, they both set off a ticking time bomb and the tension builds. Tangled webs are then created and choices must be made.I would have thought that I'd hate Sarah's and Brad's characters, for so callously betraying their significant others, but I didn't. It just made me feel sad. They have to connection at home, no warmth, and they find each other.Even Ronald, who is the most repulsive character in the movie for what he had done, manages to gain some sympathy from the audience because Larry doesn't stop. When is enough, enough?Todd Field manages to create a captivating, realistic film. You assume that it will reach a climactic, melodramatic ending, and there are a series of ups and downs, (I managed to bite off my fingernails) yet it doesn't end the way you would think. He films the way Elizabeth Berg writes: with subtlety and simplicity.

1052947,A1AYEI2SNFPYES,B000N3SU92,Dogville,"[4, 4]","After an excellent debut directorial effort with In The Bedroom, Todd Field puts his hands on bringing Tom Perotta's Little Children to the big screen. Little Children is the kind of film that deals with very the simplistic and even banal issues in life yet still succeeds at revealing the plethora of emotions within. Such is the challenge for both the director and the cast.In Little Children, no one fails.Central to the film are two characters, Sarah Pierce and Brad Adamson. Sarah is a suburban housewife who gave up her job to bring her little girl up. Married to a frequently absent and porn-obsessed husband, Sarah longs for her long-lost freedom. Brad is a third-time bar exam bound househusband who has put his younger days of glory behind while his beautiful wife makes documentaries for a living. When both Sarah and Brad meet one day at the playground in the park and later begin their ritualistic visits to the town pool, both fall in illicit love like never before to regain the lost days of adolescence. Interspersed throughout the film are smaller but cogent stories of related characters such as a psycho child pervert with a doting mother and a once-errant policeman full of rage.The delightful Kate Winslet plays Sarah Pierce with gusto. Immersed in the role, she shows a gradual keenness to break out of her long-suffering marriage to a loveless man by guiltlessly engaging in secret trysts with the very attractive but somewhat deadpan Brad played by Patrick Wilson. Though both are hardly each other's type, they fell madly into the kind of love that sought to liberate them from all burdens. The love scenes between both could be best described as raw fiery passion. Everything ends with the realization that this love wasn't headed for anywhere more than their hearts desire. Equally mesmerising are the subplots of a doting mother (Phyllis Sommerville) trying to fix her just-released pervert son (Jackie Earle Haley) who eventually lost his only lifeline to the raging cop who's out to humiliate him.Todd Field succeeds once again with his delicate treatment of the original book. Despite all the pain, loss and heartbreak, the film leaves a feeling of hope as it ends with the trusty advice, ""You can't change history, but the future is a different story. You have to start somewhere.""

An elderly woman, May hasall kinds of collectibles in her home--her various clocks are allticking away in unison as if to represent that something is going tohappen, something onimous or serious that time will only tell.She also has on disply her Hummel collection of little, cutefigurine children (as her son, Ronnie, is perversely fixated on thereal thing).Also May treats Ronnie like he was still her little boy. He callsher ""Mommy"" and she calls him ""Ronnie"". She takes him into herhouse, cooks and cleans for him (he never needs to wash a dish),protects him from the harassing ex-cop (Larry), and even sets updates for Ronnie to go on so someone will one day care for herlittle boy.2) Sarah (Kate Winslett), a young wife, and mother of young Lucy, goesregularly to the local playground with 3 so-called women friends andtheir little children.These women are hypocritcal, judgmental, boring, and unappealingpeers to Sarah. Eventually, they become angry with Sarah and shunher when she beomes intimate with a local stay-at-home father, Brad(Patrick Wilson), who is often seen at the same playground. Callinghim ""the Prom King"", these other mothers fantasize over him,preferring the mystery of him from afar (as they dare won't approachhim for fear of not being properly brushed and made up). I could seewhy Sarah wants to separate herself from them. They need a goodreality check.Giddy over this guy, like girlish women, one of the mothers evendares Sarah to get the Prom King's phone number. In turn, Sarah goesa couple steps further with this bet, sparking an odd, littleencounter that will soon mold itself into a relationship betweenthe two. Sarah's boldness gives her some triumph as she delights inseeing the women scatter off to the wind like scared, little girls,their forbidden fantasies spelled out before there eyes.3)  There are the little children of Sarah,(Lucy), and Brad,(Aaron),innocently caught up in the entanglement.4)  There is Brad's wife, Kathy, who treats Brad more like a little sonthan a wife. She earns the money in the family, so she controls thefinances. She even decides if Brad can have a sell phone andquestions his need to subscribe to a few magazines. It is herdecision, not really his own heart, that sends him off to thelibrary to study for the bar exam. She also wishes for her adorable,little boy to sleep in the middle of his parents, so sex is not veryavailable to Brad.5)  Sarah's husband, Richard, ""must"" give into his own off-the-wallfantasies, without the consideration of adult restraint orconsequences. He stumbles upon the internet porn site of ""SluttyKay"", acting out in secret what he wished he could do for real.Among other kinky things, Slutty Kay loves to dress up like aprovocative, little girl with pigtails and balloons.6)  Larry, the ex-cop, loves to push people around. He is a one-mancommittee for concerned parents (because Ronnie is in too close of aproximity to children for anyone's liking). Ronnie is very messedup, but like the bully that May McGorvey calls Larry, heconstantly harasses Ronnie, going too far. He also acts like a bigbaby when things don't go his way. When Larry is feeling bad abouthimself, he will soon direct himself to the McGorvey house to raisemore hell.One thing that haunts Larry is that he mistakenly shot a teenage boywhile on duty as a policeman.7)  Sarah finds out that her life is not what it should be. Collegeeducated, she now feels like she is playing house to her familyas a restless wife and mother. And life with Brad becomes unreal toher also, only an unfulfilled fantasy life. She buys into believingthat someone else can rescue her from her unhappy life.Nevertheless, she makes a choice that will only get more and morecomplicated.8) Brad cannot pass the bar exam, failing twice. He is coaxed by hiswife to study again for it, but he cannot seem to focus. He ratherhang outside the library and watch some teenage skate boarders,feeling like an outsider to them, yet longing for theiracceptance. ""I must have been one of them"", he thinks to himself.Little doe he know that he is trying to reclaim his lost youth.Feeling inferior to his wife, Sarah puts him on a falsepedestal, and he feels good again.Brad is irresponsible, not a man of integrity. More like a littleboy, he should not be counted on.",5,thought provoking,1217203200,"07 28, 2008",2008,4836,"['movie', 'definitely', 'made', 'think', 'title', 'Little', 'Children', 'so', 'appropriate', 'name', 'movie', 'solid', 'theme', 'entire', 'movie.Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'little', 'children', 'children', 'made', 'adults', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'well', 'acted', 'well', 'made.The', 'little', 'children', 'POINTS', 'can', 'see', 'movie:1', 'movie', 'cleverly', 'out', 'McGorvey', 'house', 'Ronnie', 'town', 'child', 'sex', 'offender', 'who', 'exposed', 'minor', 'andhis', 'devoted', 'doting', 'mother', 'May', 'McGorvey', 'elderly', 'woman', 'May', 'hasall', 'kinds', 'collectibles', 'home', 'various', 'clocks', 'are', 'allticking', 'away', 'unison', 'represent', 'something', 'going', 'tohappen', 'something', 'onimous', 'serious', 'time', 'will', 'only', 'tell.She', 'also', 'disply', 'Hummel', 'collection', 'little', 'cutefigurine', 'children', 'son', 'Ronnie', 'perversely', 'fixated', 'thereal', 'thing', '.Also', 'May', 'Ronnie', 'was', 'still', 'little', 'boy', 'Mommy', 'Ronnie', 'herhouse', 'cooks', 'cleans', 'never', 'wash', 'dish', 'harassing', 'ex-cop', 'Larry', 'even', 'sets', 'Ronnie', 'go', 'so', 'someone', 'will', 'one', 'day', 'care', 'herlittle', 'boy.2', 'Sarah', 'Kate', 'Winslett', 'young', 'wife', 'mother', 'young', 'Lucy', 'goesregularly', 'local', 'playground', '3', 'so-called', 'women', 'andtheir', 'little', 'children.These', 'women', 'are', 'hypocritcal', 'judgmental', 'boring', 'unappealingpeers', 'Sarah', 'Eventually', 'become', 'angry', 'Sarah', 'shunher', 'when', 'intimate', 'local', 'stay-at-home', 'father', 'Brad', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'who', 'often', 'seen', 'same', 'playground', 'Callinghim', 'Prom', 'King', 'other', 'mothers', 'fantasize', 'preferring', 'mystery', 'afar', 'dare', 'wo', ""n't"", 'approachhim', 'fear', 'not', 'being', 'properly', 'brushed', 'made', 'up', 'could', 'seewhy', 'Sarah', 'separate', 'need', 'goodreality', 'check.Giddy', 'guy', 'girlish', 'women', 'one', 'mothers', 'Sarah', 'get', 'Prom', 'King', 'phone', 'number', 'turn', 'Sarah', 'goesa', 'couple', 'steps', 'further', 'bet', 'sparking', 'odd', 'littleencounter', 'will', 'soon', 'mold', 'relationship', 'betweenthe', 'two', 'Sarah', 'boldness', 'triumph', 'inseeing', 'women', 'scatter', 'wind', 'scared', 'little', 'girls', 'forbidden', 'fantasies', 'spelled', 'out', 'eyes.3', 'are', 'little', 'children', 'Sarah', 'Lucy', 'Brad', 'Aaron', 'innocently', 'caught', 'up', 'entanglement.4', 'Brad', 'wife', 'Kathy', 'who', 'Brad', 'more', 'little', 'sonthan', 'wife', 'money', 'family', 'thefinances', 'even', 'Brad', 'can', 'have', 'sell', 'phone', 'andquestions', 'need', 'subscribe', 'few', 'magazines', 'herdecision', 'not', 'really', 'own', 'heart', 'off', 'thelibrary', 'study', 'bar', 'exam', 'also', 'adorable', 'little', 'boy', 'sleep', 'middle', 'parents', 'sex', 'not', 'veryavailable', 'Brad.5', 'Sarah', 'husband', 'Richard', 'must', 'give', 'own', 'off-the-wallfantasies', 'consideration', 'adult', 'restraint', 'orconsequences', 'internet', 'porn', 'site', 'SluttyKay', 'acting', 'out', 'secret', 'what', 'wished', 'could', 'do', 'real.Among', 'other', 'kinky', 'things', 'Slutty', 'Kay', 'dress', 'up', 'aprovocative', 'little', 'girl', 'pigtails', 'balloons.6', 'Larry', 'ex-cop', 'push', 'people', 'around', 'one-mancommittee', 'concerned', 'parents', 'Ronnie', 'too', 'close', 'aproximity', 'children', 'anyone', 'liking', 'Ronnie', 'very', 'messedup', 'bully', 'May', 'McGorvey', 'Larry', 'heconstantly', 'Ronnie', 'going', 'too', 'far', 'also', 'bigbaby', 'when', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'way', 'When', 'Larry', 'feeling', 'bad', 'abouthimself', 'will', 'soon', 'direct', 'McGorvey', 'house', 'raisemore', 'hell.One', 'thing', 'Larry', 'mistakenly', 'shot', 'teenage', 'boywhile', 'duty', 'policeman.7', 'Sarah', 'out', 'life', 'not', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'Collegeeducated', 'now', 'playing', 'house', 'familyas', 'restless', 'wife', 'mother', 'life', 'Brad', 'becomes', 'unreal', 'toher', 'also', 'only', 'unfulfilled', 'fantasy', 'life', 'someone', 'else', 'can', 'rescue', 'unhappy', 'life.Nevertheless', 'choice', 'will', 'only', 'get', 'more', 'morecomplicated.8', 'Brad', 'can', 'not', 'pass', 'bar', 'exam', 'failing', 'twice', 'coaxed', 'hiswife', 'study', 'again', 'can', 'not', 'seem', 'focus', 'ratherhang', 'library', 'watch', 'teenage', 'skate', 'boarders', 'feeling', 'outsider', 'yet', 'longing', 'theiracceptance', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'himself.Little', 'doe', 'know', 'trying', 'reclaim', 'lost', 'youth.Feeling', 'inferior', 'wife', 'Sarah', 'falsepedestal', 'good', 'again.Brad', 'irresponsible', 'not', 'man', 'integrity', 'More', 'littleboy', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'counted']",N/A

1052950,AC1K4OQOZ90RS,B000N3SU92,"E. Bukowsky ""booklover10""","[5, 6]","Having read and enjoyed ""Little Children,"" Tom Perrotta's provocative novel set in suburbia, I suspected that it would not translate well to the screen.  It is, in many ways, too subtle to be captured cinematically.  However, Todd Field, the director/screenwriter, and Perrotta, who shares the screenwriting credit with Field, almost pull it off.  Kate Winslet plays the pivotal role of Sarah Pierce, a lost soul who married an older man, had an adorable daughter, Lucy, and then ceased to exist as an independent and fulfilled woman.  Sarah does not communicate with her husband (who is addicted to Internet porn).  She has nothing in common with the other mothers whom she meets in the playground, and she does not enjoy being a full-time mom.  Sarah is truly a lonely and desperate housewife.One day, while sitting in the playground, Sarah boldly accosts a gorgeous stay-at-home dad, Brad Adamson, who cares for his towheaded boy, Aaron, while his wife, Kathy, makes documentary films for public television.  Brad, in his own way, is equally as lost as Sarah.  His wife treats him with thinly veiled contempt because he has already failed the bar exam twice, and she even monitors his expenditures.  He feels emasculated and at loose ends, and seeks solace watching young skateboarders do tricks; he dreams longingly of his carefree days as a jock.  Unlike Sarah, Brad loves being a parent, and he is terrific with Aaron.  When Sarah and Brad connect emotionally and sexually, they begin to meet on the sly, disregarding the potential fallout of their affair.Matters are complicated by the recent arrival in town of an unprepossessing man named Ronnie McGorvey, who has moved in with his mother after serving a prison sentence for indecent exposure.  In one of the film's most touching performances, Phyllis Somerville shines as May McGorvey, a loving and tender woman who sees something good in her balding, scary-looking son.  May believes that if her Ronnie would only wear a nice outfit and go out on dates, he would be capable of living a normal life.  The McGorveys are not destined to live in peace, however.  Larry Hedges, played with fierce energy by Noah Emmerich, is a retired and mentally unhinged cop with a chip on his shoulder.  He harasses the McGorveys and makes their existence hell.  The other neighbors also make it clear that they do not relish the presence of a potential child molester in their midst.""Little Children"" has uniformly outstanding performances.  Winslet is a bit too beautiful for the role of Sarah, but she inhabits the character with her usual aplomb; Patrick Wilson nicely captures Brad's neediness.  Jackie Earle Haley is appropriately eerie as a man who is a prisoner in his own skin, even though he is no longer technically in jail.  Mary B. McCann, as Mary Ann, is a brusque and judgmental mother who thinks Sarah is scandalously negligent and inadequate, and Jane Adams is marvelous as the unfortunate woman who lands a date with Ronnie McGorvey.  It is an evening that she will not soon forget.  Even the two children, Ty Simpkins as Aaron Adamson, and Sadie Goldstein as Lucy Pierce, are adorable and touching.Field presents ""Little Children"" as a series of vignettes:  Sarah and Brad meet at the pool, Sarah and Brad develop a sexual relationship, Sarah goes to a book discussion about ""Madame Bovary,"" Ronnie's mother tries to mold him into an acceptable person, Larry drags Brad to a night touch-football game, and so on.  Both in the book and the film, the subplot about the ex-con does not quite gel with the rest of the story.  Perrotta and Field omit quite a bit of material from the novel and change the ending somewhat, but the whole is still less than the sum of its parts.  The movie often feels artificial and forced, and the script's seriocomic tone keeps veering from humor to tragedy. The problem is exacerbated by an intrusive voiceover in which an omniscient narrator comments, somewhat satirically, on the characters and their actions.  What we are left with is a story about isolated, immature, and hypocritical people who cannot communicate with their friends and family and who are incapable of even articulating how very unhappy they are.  Is this a problem with suburbia (as reviewers of the book concluded) or is this alienation an unfortunate aspect of modern life both in urban and rural America?  That is a question for viewers to ponder and discuss with one another after leaving the theater.  Although ""Little Children"" is not a perfect film, see it for the great acting.",4,All the lonely people.,1168819200,"01 15, 2007",2007,4550,"['Having', 'read', 'enjoyed', 'Little', 'Children', 'Tom', 'Perrotta', 'provocative', 'novel', 'set', 'suburbia', 'suspected', 'would', 'not', 'translate', 'well', 'screen', 'many', 'ways', 'too', 'subtle', 'be', 'captured', 'cinematically', 'However', 'Todd', 'Field', 'director/screenwriter', 'Perrotta', 'who', 'shares', 'screenwriting', 'credit', 'Field', 'almost', 'pull', 'off', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'pivotal', 'role', 'Sarah', 'Pierce', 'lost', 'soul', 'who', 'married', 'older', 'man', 'had', 'adorable', 'daughter', 'Lucy', 'then', 'ceased', 'exist', 'independent', 'fulfilled', 'woman', 'Sarah', 'not', 'communicate', 'husband', 'who', 'addicted', 'Internet', 'porn', 'nothing', 'common', 'other', 'mothers', 'whom', 'playground', 'not', 'enjoy', 'being', 'full-time', 'mom', 'Sarah', 'truly', 'lonely', 'desperate', 'housewife.One', 'day', 'sitting', 'playground', 'Sarah', 'boldly', 'gorgeous', 'stay-at-home', 'dad', 'Brad', 'Adamson', 'who', 'towheaded', 'boy', 'Aaron', 'wife', 'Kathy', 'documentary', 'films', 'public', 'television', 'Brad', 'own', 'way', 'equally', 'as', 'lost', 'Sarah', 'wife', 'thinly', 'veiled', 'contempt', 'already', 'failed', 'bar', 'exam', 'twice', 'even', 'monitors', 'expenditures', 'emasculated', 'loose', 'ends', 'solace', 'watching', 'young', 'skateboarders', 'do', 'tricks', 'longingly', 'carefree', 'days', 'jock', 'Sarah', 'Brad', 'being', 'parent', 'terrific', 'Aaron', 'When', 'Sarah', 'Brad', 'connect', 'emotionally', 'sexually', 'begin', 'meet', 'sly', 'disregarding', 'potential', 'fallout', 'affair.Matters', 'are', 'complicated', 'recent', 'arrival', 'town', 'unprepossessing', 'man', 'named', 'Ronnie', 'McGorvey', 'who', 'moved', 'mother', 'serving', 'prison', 'sentence', 'indecent', 'exposure', 'one', 'film', 'most', 'touching', 'performances', 'Phyllis', 'Somerville', 'shines', 'May', 'McGorvey', 'loving', 'tender', 'woman', 'who', 'something', 'good', 'balding', 'scary-looking', 'son', 'May', 'Ronnie', 'would', 'only', 'wear', 'nice', 'outfit', 'go', 'out', 'dates', 'would', 'be', 'capable', 'living', 'normal', 'life', 'McGorveys', 'are', 'not', 'destined', 'live', 'peace', 'however', 'Larry', 'Hedges', 'played', 'fierce', 'energy', 'Noah', 'Emmerich', 'retired', 'mentally', 'unhinged', 'cop', 'chip', 'shoulder', 'McGorveys', 'existence', 'hell', 'other', 'neighbors', 'also', 'make', 'clear', 'do', 'not', 'relish', 'presence', 'potential', 'child', 'molester', 'midst', 'Little', 'Children', 'uniformly', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'Winslet', 'bit', 'too', 'beautiful', 'role', 'Sarah', 'character', 'usual', 'aplomb', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'nicely', 'Brad', 'neediness', 'Jackie', 'Earle', 'Haley', 'appropriately', 'eerie', 'man', 'who', 'prisoner', 'own', 'skin', 'even', 'no', 'longer', 'technically', 'jail', 'Mary', 'B.', 'McCann', 'Mary', 'Ann', 'brusque', 'judgmental', 'mother', 'who', 'Sarah', 'scandalously', 'negligent', 'inadequate', 'Jane', 'Adams', 'marvelous', 'unfortunate', 'woman', 'who', 'date', 'Ronnie', 'McGorvey', 'evening', 'will', 'not', 'soon', 'forget', 'Even', 'two', 'children', 'Ty', 'Simpkins', 'Aaron', 'Adamson', 'Sadie', 'Goldstein', 'Lucy', 'Pierce', 'are', 'adorable', 'touching.Field', 'presents', 'Little', 'Children', 'series', 'vignettes', 'Sarah', 'Brad', 'meet', 'pool', 'Sarah', 'Brad', 'develop', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'Sarah', 'book', 'discussion', 'Madame', 'Bovary', 'Ronnie', 'mother', 'mold', 'acceptable', 'person', 'Larry', 'Brad', 'night', 'touch-football', 'game', 'so', 'book', 'film', 'subplot', 'ex-con', 'not', 'quite', 'gel', 'rest', 'story', 'Perrotta', 'Field', 'omit', 'quite', 'bit', 'material', 'novel', 'change', 'ending', 'somewhat', 'whole', 'still', 'less', 'sum', 'parts', 'movie', 'often', 'artificial', 'forced', 'script', 'seriocomic', 'tone', 'keeps', 'veering', 'humor', 'tragedy', 'problem', 'exacerbated', 'intrusive', 'voiceover', 'omniscient', 'narrator', 'comments', 'somewhat', 'satirically', 'characters', 'actions', 'What', 'are', 'left', 'story', 'isolated', 'immature', 'hypocritical', 'people', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'communicate', 'friends', 'family', 'who', 'are', 'incapable', 'even', 'articulating', 'how', 'very', 'unhappy', 'are', 'problem', 'suburbia', 'reviewers', 'book', 'concluded', 'alienation', 'unfortunate', 'aspect', 'modern', 'life', 'urban', 'rural', 'America', 'question', 'viewers', 'ponder', 'discuss', 'one', 'leaving', 'theater', 'Little', 'Children', 'not', 'perfect', 'film', 'see', 'great', 'acting']",N/A

1052952,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000N3SU92,Ed Uyeshima,"[4, 4]","Developing his own particular cinematic oeuvre in presenting fully dimensional, flawed characters in suburbia under perplexing circumstances, director and co-screenwriter Todd Field has pulled together a most observant and resonant film about middle class values and foibles in a small Massachusetts community beleaguered by their escalating contempt over the return of a convicted sex offender named Ronnie J. McGorvey. Co-written by Tom Perrotta, upon whose 2004 satirical novel provides the plot's source, the 2006 film is a curiously offbeat but surprisingly powerful mix of black comedy and melodrama that uses Gustave Flaubert'sMadame Bovaryas its leitmotif.The focus is on two married people, Sarah and Brad, who decide to carry on an adulterous affair during a particularly hot summer. Married to a branding executive obsessed with Internet porn, Sarah is becoming increasingly dissatisfied with her domestic life as wife and mother. She regularly meets a Stepford Wives coven of young mothers in the park, where they fantasize about Brad, a stay-at-home dad whose wife Kathy is a successful PBS documentary filmmaker as he studies for the state bar exam for the third time. What starts out as a flirtation becomes something more substantive. Meanwhile, McGorvey moves in with his aged mother to attempt a new start at life, but the neighborhood is up in arms to have a convicted pedophile lurking about with their children vulnerable targets. The most outraged is ex-cop Larry Hedges, who leads a vigilante squad that doubles as an after-work football team.Guided by a surprisingly effective voiceover narration (usually such tactics substitute weak plot development), the two storylines stay at arm's length from each other until the climax but in a pervasive manner in which each feeds the other, none more so than the tense community pool scene where McGorvey's presence turns into a seriocomic scene fromJaws. Field, a former actor himself, and Perrotta have developed intriguing characters that individually bring out a variety of responses from the viewer. A standout cast has been assembled starting with Kate Winslet, eschewing any remnant of her English accent and conveying the ennui and veiled longing in Sarah in nuanced strokes. Patrick Wilson also does a fine job dismantling the insecurity behind the unfulfilling golden boy myth propping up Brad's life.Playing more extreme characters, Noah Emmerich evokes Larry's rage with pounding force, while Jackie Earle Haley lends a scarifying presence as Ronnie in the most subtle of ways, including a painfully affecting blind date-from-hell scene with a depressed neurotic played memorably by Jane Adams. Phyllis Somerville has a few strong scenes as Ronnie's take-charge mother, while Jennifer Connelly stays mainly on the sidelines as Kathy until she realizes what may be happening. There is an honest sense of introspection going on with all the major characters in the film, and Field does a superb job of leaving us with no clear-cut answers but emotionally satisfied regardless. There is also nice work to be found in Antonio Calvache's clean cinematography and David Gropman's meticulous production design. Even though the print transfer is pristine, the 2007 DVD is unfortunately bereft of any extras - no commentary, no making-of featurette and no deleted scenes.",4,"Black Comedy and Melodrama Mix Well in a Sharp Character Study of Adultery, Suburban Ennui and Personal Fears",1178496000,"05 7, 2007",2007,3341,"['Developing', 'own', 'particular', 'cinematic', 'oeuvre', 'presenting', 'fully', 'dimensional', 'flawed', 'characters', 'suburbia', 'perplexing', 'circumstances', 'director', 'co-screenwriter', 'Todd', 'Field', 'pulled', 'together', 'most', 'observant', 'resonant', 'film', 'middle', 'class', 'values', 'foibles', 'small', 'Massachusetts', 'community', 'beleaguered', 'escalating', 'contempt', 'return', 'convicted', 'sex', 'offender', 'named', 'Ronnie', 'J.', 'McGorvey', 'Co-written', 'Tom', 'Perrotta', '2004', 'satirical', 'novel', 'plot', 'source', '2006', 'film', 'curiously', 'offbeat', 'surprisingly', 'powerful', 'mix', 'black', 'comedy', 'melodrama', 'Gustave', ""Flaubert'sMadame"", 'Bovaryas', 'leitmotif.The', 'focus', 'two', 'married', 'people', 'Sarah', 'Brad', 'who', 'decide', 'carry', 'adulterous', 'affair', 'particularly', 'hot', 'summer', 'Married', 'branding', 'executive', 'obsessed', 'Internet', 'porn', 'Sarah', 'becoming', 'increasingly', 'dissatisfied', 'domestic', 'life', 'wife', 'mother', 'regularly', 'Stepford', 'Wives', 'coven', 'young', 'mothers', 'park', 'where', 'fantasize', 'Brad', 'stay-at-home', 'dad', 'wife', 'Kathy', 'successful', 'PBS', 'documentary', 'filmmaker', 'studies', 'state', 'bar', 'exam', 'third', 'time', 'What', 'out', 'flirtation', 'something', 'more', 'substantive', 'Meanwhile', 'McGorvey', 'aged', 'mother', 'attempt', 'new', 'start', 'life', 'neighborhood', 'up', 'arms', 'have', 'convicted', 'pedophile', 'lurking', 'children', 'vulnerable', 'targets', 'most', 'outraged', 'ex-cop', 'Larry', 'Hedges', 'who', 'vigilante', 'squad', 'after-work', 'football', 'team.Guided', 'surprisingly', 'effective', 'voiceover', 'narration', 'usually', 'such', 'tactics', 'substitute', 'weak', 'plot', 'development', 'two', 'storylines', 'stay', 'arm', 'length', 'other', 'climax', 'pervasive', 'manner', 'other', 'none', 'more', 'so', 'tense', 'community', 'pool', 'scene', 'where', 'McGorvey', 'presence', 'seriocomic', 'scene', 'fromJaws', 'Field', 'former', 'actor', 'Perrotta', 'have', 'developed', 'intriguing', 'characters', 'individually', 'bring', 'out', 'variety', 'responses', 'viewer', 'standout', 'cast', 'been', 'assembled', 'starting', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'eschewing', 'remnant', 'English', 'accent', 'conveying', 'ennui', 'veiled', 'longing', 'Sarah', 'nuanced', 'strokes', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'also', 'fine', 'job', 'dismantling', 'insecurity', 'unfulfilling', 'golden', 'boy', 'myth', 'propping', 'up', 'Brad', 'life.Playing', 'more', 'extreme', 'characters', 'Noah', 'Emmerich', 'Larry', 'rage', 'pounding', 'force', 'Jackie', 'Earle', 'Haley', 'scarifying', 'presence', 'Ronnie', 'most', 'subtle', 'ways', 'including', 'painfully', 'affecting', 'date-from-hell', 'scene', 'depressed', 'neurotic', 'played', 'memorably', 'Jane', 'Adams', 'Phyllis', 'Somerville', 'few', 'strong', 'scenes', 'Ronnie', 'take-charge', 'mother', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'mainly', 'sidelines', 'Kathy', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'happening', 'honest', 'sense', 'introspection', 'going', 'major', 'characters', 'film', 'Field', 'superb', 'job', 'leaving', 'clear-cut', 'answers', 'emotionally', 'satisfied', 'regardless', 'also', 'nice', 'work', 'be', 'found', 'Antonio', 'Calvache', 'clean', 'cinematography', 'David', 'Gropman', 'meticulous', 'production', 'design', 'Even', 'print', 'transfer', 'pristine', '2007', 'DVD', 'unfortunately', 'bereft', 'extras', 'commentary', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'deleted', 'scenes']",N/A
1052953,A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4,B000N3SU92,Elisabeth,"[15, 22]","Wife and stay-at-home mother (Kate Winslet) hates how her life has turned out.  She resents having to nurture her daughter and perceives her husband as controlling her life.Husband and stay-at-home father (Patrick Wilson) also hates how his life has turned out.  He resents that his son seems to favor his wife more than him (when really, the son just misses his mom) and perceives his wife as too controlling and not as readily available for sex as he wants.Both are unhappy, but neither choose to handle their problems in mature ways.  Instead, they both prefer to wallow in self-pity.One day, these two meet at a park and, after exchanging some small talk, they kiss each other on the lips...while their kids are right there watching.Soon after, they intentionally spend lots of time together and unsurprisingly, end up having sex with each other...while their kids are in the other room sleeping.As if showing a total disregard for their children weren't bad enough, they also disregard the feelings of the spouses they're cheating on.After their kiss, the narrator explains that Kate feels no guilt over kissing another man behind her husband's back. During sex, Patrick asks her if she feels guilty about what they're doing and again, Kate says she feels no guilt.During sex, Patrick does express guilt, but then actually becomes more aroused afterwards.  In another scene, he even acts smug that he's able to trick his wife into thinking nothing's going on between him and Kate.The more this movie continued, the more disturbingly narcissistic these two came across. These two are so narcissistic that not only do they feel justified in cheating on their spouses, but they also feel justified in kidnapping the kids from their spouses, too.And yet...I got the feeling I was supposed to be lovingly understanding of what these two are doing. This movie felt like a self-serving justification for adultery.One way this movie justifies adultery is by portraying the betrayed spouses as lousy spouses, too.For example, Kate's husband is portrayed as a weird, panty-sniffing porn addict...and Patrick's wife is portrayed as a sexually withholding, controlling workaholic.So the message it sends here is that if you had bad spouses like these, you'd be cheating, too.Another way this movie justifies adultery is by displaying a sharp contrast in intelligence between those in favor of adultery and those opposed.An example is the book club scene where a group of women are reviewing the book, ""Madame Bovary"".Only one woman objects to the adultery in that book and objects in a very loud-mouthed, uneducated way. Her only argument against adultery is that any woman who commits it must be a slut.In contrast to this woman, Kate comes across as very calm and collected as she explains that this isn't about cheating. It's about feminism...about how an affair can empower a woman and make her realize that being happy is her right.The rest of the women nod their heads in agreement and look at the lone objector in contempt. The lone objector feels overpowered by the majority and instead of defending her principles, concedes that she must not have understood the book correctly.Okay, I have two problems with this scene.First, empowerment is not the same as overpowering someone.  Cheating strips people of their options like having a say in who their partner sleeps with...as well as having the power to leave if cheating is a deal-breaker for them.  Instead, the one cheating gets to call all the shots.And yet, the irony here is that Kate had been complaining about how controlling her husband was...but if she's stringing him along while bedding another, that demonstrates just how controlling she is, too.Second, feminism is about empowering ALL women...that includes the wife being cheated on, too.  If Kate cared so much about empowering women, then she never would've helped Patrick strip away his wife's power by cheating on her.But Kate showed no concern over how the affair affected his wife. Instead, her only concern was getting what she wanted at any cost....and then exploiting feminism to justify her self-serving behavior.None of these arguments, however, are presented in this movie. Instead, any objections are presented in an irrational and uneducated way.A side story in this movie plays out the same way.The side story involves a pedophile who's just been released. The person objecting the most about pedophilia is portrayed the same way as the woman objecting the most about adultery...loud-mouthed, uneducated and irrational.There's a scene where the pedophile goes snorkeling in a swimming pool filled with children. When the parents realize who's in the pool with their children, there's a dramatic stampede as they yell for their kids to get out of the pool.Again, people daring to stand up for their beliefs are portrayed as irrational and harshly judgmental.But what's being ignored here is that the adulterers in this film are just as judgmental.Although the adulterers don't want to be harshly judged, they have no problem harshly judging their spouses and even using those harsh judgments as justification to cheat on them.And although the pedophile comes across as soft-spoken and gentle, he also seems to want everyone to just get over what he did and not pay any consequences for his actions.Of course, he doesn't deserve to be abused or have his home vandalized...but is he entitled to enter a pool of half-naked children while he himself is half naked and wearing goggles (so he can check out their little bodies)?  No way.  I think these parents were perfectly justified in keeping their children away from him.What's interesting is that this movie preaches against being judgmental towards non-conformists...but at the same time, also judges those who don't conform to the non-conformists' standards in a harshly judgmental way.This movie preaches acceptance...yet any objections are immediately dismissed as invalid.So this movie preaches, but it doesn't practice what it preaches.",1,A judgmental movie preaching against being judgmental,1270080000,"04 1, 2010",2010,6023,"['Wife', 'stay-at-home', 'mother', 'Kate',

1052954,A2AGSAEFD495PW,B000N3SU92,Emilyjak,"[1, 1]","This is the ""lesson"" I gleaned from the movie.  Children have basic custodial needs.  The mothers and fathers in the movie provided for these needs.  Children also have emotional needs and often use selfish tactics to meet these needs.  They must grow and mature in order to meet these needs in a healthy way, especially if those needs aren't nurtured by their parents.Plenty of children grow to become selfish, needy adults.  The two main characters, and many of the supporting characters, are examples of this.  They use each other.  One female character feels a soul-mate type connection with another character, but the other character easily substitutes the adrenaline rush he gets from her with the adrenaline rush he receives from skateboarding with some pre-pubescent boys.  He relates to the boys because he did not have a mother at that age and feels smothered and controlled by the mother of his child, who simply wishes him to grow up and take adult responsibility.One character substitutes the power and gratification he receives from exploiting children with the power and gratification he receives when he exploits a mentally/emotionally fragile and vulnerable adult woman in the same way.Although the ending points to some resolution, I don't believe it is the happy sort.",5,Little Children Have Selfish Needs,1353974400,"11 27, 2012",2012,1287,"['lesson', 'gleaned', 'movie', 'Children', 'have', 'basic', 'custodial', 'needs', 'mothers', 'fathers', 'movie', 'provided', 'needs', 'Children', 'also', 'have', 'emotional', 'needs', 'often', 'use', 'selfish', 'tactics', 'meet', 'needs', 'must', 'grow', 'mature', 'order', 'meet', 'needs', 'healthy', 'way', 'especially', 'needs', 'are', ""n't"", 'nurtured', 'parents.Plenty', 'children', 'grow', 'become', 'selfish', 'needy', 'adults', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'many', 'supporting', 'characters', 'are', 'examples', 'use', 'other', 'One', 'female', 'character', 'feels', 'soul-mate', 'type', 'connection', 'character', 'other', 'character', 'easily', 'adrenaline', 'rush', 'adrenaline', 'rush', 'skateboarding', 'pre-pubescent', 'boys', 'boys', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'mother', 'age', 'feels', 'smothered', 'controlled', 'mother', 'child', 'who', 'simply', 'grow', 'up', 'take', 'adult', 'responsibility.One', 'character', 'power', 'gratification', 'exploiting', 'children', 'power', 'gratification', 'when', 'mentally/emotionally', 'fragile', 'vulnerable', 'adult', 'woman', 'same', 'ending', 'points', 'resolution', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'happy', 'sort']",N/A

1052956,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000N3SU92,Grady Harp,"[3, 5]","LITTLE CHILDREN is one of the finest films of the past decade, a film that is intensely intelligent in concept, in writing, in acting, and in production values.  It is rare to find a film so right in every aspect,  dealing with aspects of living we'd all rather overlook while at the same time recognizing bits and pieces of ourselves and of those around us in manner that contributes to the frightening credibility of the story.Todd Field, so highly respected for his previous film 'In the Bedroom', directs the story from the novel by Tom Perrotta with whom he wrote the screenplay. It deals with the way children perceive the world, even when those children are of adult age.  Thwarted Sarah (Kate Winslet) is bored with her life in a little town in Massachusetts where she lives a tepid life with her sexually absent husband Richard (Gregg Edelman) who prefers  online porno to Sarah's needs.  Sarah and her daughter Lucy spend the days at the park (with bitchy nosey boring fellow housewives and their children) and encounters the stay-at-home Dad, Brad (Patrick Wilson),  called the 'Prom King' by the klatch. Sarah and Brad meet and a slow and smoldering 'affair' begins (Brad is married to the beautiful but distant Kathy (Jennifer Connelly): they are each seeking to fill the needs that they perceive have eluded them.  Meanwhile the town is set on its ear by the return of convicted Ronnie (Jackie Earle Haley), released from jail for exposing himself to little children, and now living with his mother who is a strong mother and loves her son despite his past.  The story is told to us by a narrator who unwinds the events like a channeler, showing how each of these disparate people come to realize that they are each acting with retarded, regressive emotional skills usually found only in children.  And in the end of the story each has been forced to mature - or have they?The entire cast is brilliant as is the quality of direction by Field.  The musical score and the hauntingly beautiful cinematography add to the pulsating rhythm of this exploration of the psyches of 21st century adults.  It may be a difficult movie to watch for some, but it is a triumph of cinematic art.  Highly Recommended.

1052958,AAIL33CYCT47J,B000N3SU92,Gregory Baird,"[48, 53]","""Little Children,"" directed by Todd Field (who also scored with the 2001 filmIn the Bedroom), is a spectacular adaptation of the Tom Perrotta novel from which it is derived.  Field and Perrotta, who co-wrote the screenplay, captured the essence of the book and made it sparkle on the screen.  It focuses on Brad and Sarah, two unhappily married people who feel that their lives have been waylaid by parenthood.  Brad was a college athlete bound for a career as an attorney when his beautiful wife's work as a director of documentaries took off, they had a son, and Brad became seemingly incapable of passing the bar exam (his wife, by the way, is played by Jennifer Connelly, who does quite a lot with a relatively small amount of screen time).  He doesn't really mind being cast as Mr. Mom, seeing as his greater ambitions seem to have gone up in smoke, but he does feel uncomfortable around the moms populating the playground and town pool -- who have dubbed him ""the prom king"" because of his good looks.  That all changes when he meets kindred spirit Sarah (the exquisitely natural Kate Winslet, who earned an Oscar nom for her deeply layered and precise performance), who had been on her way to a PhD in literature until marriage and motherhood got in the way.  Now her already shaky marriage is on the rocks thanks to her husband's curious use of 'office time' (I won't spoil the surprise), and she and Brad jump at the opportunity to throw it all away by starting a passionate affair while their children nap during playdates.  The title, you see, refers to the adults in this story as much as the children that have appeared in their lives.  ""Little Children"" is filled with characters in a state of arrested development -- either unable or unwilling to grow up and face the real life of bills, chores, snack times, diapers, and such that they find themselves consumed by.Add into this mix the subplot involving a registered sex offender (played by the film's other Academy Award nominee, Jackie Earle Haley) who moves to town after getting sprung from prison and you've got a stellar, complicated movie going.  The tone is comedic and dramatic, optimistic and heartbreaking, relatable yet disturbing -- a dangerous high wire act, to be sure, but one that Field and the stellar cast navigate with the greatest of ease.  And Field knows how to use symbolism very well: the subtle sound of trains inexorably chugging away in the background of the film's beginning scenes, growing louder and more ominous as the plotlines converge and begin to 'derail', the screaming sound of insects in another key scene, cracks at the bottom of a swimming pool ... he really has an eye for the tiny details you almost don't notice.  His one misstep?  The narration of the film is too obvious in an otherwise subtle, genius film.  Field's staging hints at the themes too well to have them explained to us, and the actors do such a great job conveying their character's inner desires that we don't need to have someone tell us that information.  A scene in which Brad triumphantly charges toward the end zone during a football game is so overdone with narration and cheesy music that it's actually groan-inducing.  I think that Field was trying to be cheesy in that moment, but he succeeded a little too well at it.  The special features are also non-existant, which is a disappointment.  But at any rate, it is a spectacular flick, and I would highly recommend it.But be sure to pick up the book,Little Children: A Novelas well.  With more elbow room than a film's inevitable demands on running time can allow, Perrotta really gets at a host of other characters and ideas that are minor in the movie.

Had I not read the novel first, I suspect I would have given it four or five stars, as many reviewers here have done. But the novel is really much better -- and even though Tom Perrotta adapted his own novel for the screenplay, it just isn't as good.The acting, overall, is excellent. Kate Winslet is fantastic (as usual), as is Jackie Earle Haley. But Jennifer Connelly, though good, was somewhat underwhelming. Not that I blame her; she just wasn't given enough to do. Noah Emmerich and Patrick Wilson are also great, but not quite in Winslet and Haley's league.Turning to the film itself, I have to say that by far the weirdest, most distracting, and inexplicable choice is the narrative voice-over. Ugh. I don't know who to blame for this -- Tom Perotta (screenplay) or Todd Field (directing). But with only one or two exceptions, it just doesn't work -- at least, again, for those familiar with the novel.I will say that at many points, the direction and cinematography are very compelling. There's a particular sequence, designed to show the passage of time at the Town Pool over the course of the summer, that is just amazingly done. Those sorts of sequences are almost a clich&eacute; these days, but this one was fresh and visually interesting. Also, the -- ahem -- au naturel scenes between Sarah and Brad (Winslet and Wilson) are consistently framed in grey, recalling the dreary, rainy afternoon the first time they were intimate and reinforcing the ultimate emptiness of their relationship. This was a great touch.The ending of the film departs from that of the novel in a *major* way (which I will not spoil). I do have to say that in one, single respect (relating to the Ronnie McGorvey character), I think the film actually outdoes the novel. Perhaps Perotta decided he'd rather have done it differently? And it really works! But outside of that, the rest of the film's ending is anticlimactic, undramatic, and loses something very significant from the message delivered in the novel.Final verdict: pretty good (3 stars; but Amazon doesn't have  stars), but certainly not what it *might* have been, and not what I *hoped* for after reading the excellent novel on which it's based.",3,Another film adaptation that suffers by comparison with the novel,1181260800,"06 8, 2007",2007,2364,"['read', 'Tom', 'Perrotta', 'Little', 'Children', 'film', 'based', 'right', 'seeing', 'film', 'think', 'translation', 'screen', 'suffers', 'comparison', 'Had', 'not', 'read', 'novel', 'first', 'suspect', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'four', 'five', 'stars', 'many', 'reviewers', 'here', 'have', 'done', 'novel', 'really', 'much', 'better', 'even', 'Tom', 'Perrotta', 'adapted', 'own', 'novel', 'screenplay', 'just', ""n't"", 'good.The', 'acting', 'overall', 'excellent', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'fantastic', 'usual', 'Jackie', 'Earle', 'Haley', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'though', 'good', 'was', 'somewhat', 'underwhelming', 'Not', 'blame', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'given', 'enough', 'do', 'Noah', 'Emmerich', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'are', 'also', 'great', 'not', 'quite', 'Winslet', 'Haley', 'league.Turning', 'film', 'have', 'say', 'far', 'weirdest', 'most', 'distracting', 'inexplicable', 'choice', 'narrative', 'voice-over', 'Ugh', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'blame', 'Tom', 'Perotta', 'screenplay', 'Todd', 'Field', 'directing', 'only', 'one', 'two', 'exceptions', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'least', 'again', 'familiar', 'novel.I', 'will', 'say', 'many', 'points', 'direction', 'cinematography', 'are', 'very', 'compelling', 'particular', 'sequence', 'designed', 'show', 'passage', 'time', 'Town', 'Pool', 'course', 'summer', 'just', 'amazingly', 'done', 'sorts', 'sequences', 'are', 'almost', 'clich', 'eacute', 'days', 'one', 'was', 'fresh', 'visually', 'interesting', 'Also', 'ahem', 'au', 'naturel', 'scenes', 'Sarah', 'Brad', 'Winslet', 'Wilson', 'are', 'consistently', 'framed', 'grey', 'recalling', 'dreary', 'rainy', 'afternoon', 'first', 'time', 'were', 'intimate', 'reinforcing', 'ultimate', 'emptiness', 'relationship', 'was', 'great', 'touch.The', 'ending', 'film', 'departs', 'novel', '*major*', 'way', 'will', 'not', 'spoil', 'do', 'have', 'say', 'one', 'single', 'respect', 'relating', 'Ronnie', 'McGorvey', 'character', 'think', 'film', 'actually', 'novel', 'Perhaps', 'Perotta', 'decided', ""'d"", 'rather', 'have', 'done', 'differently', 'really', 'rest', 'film', 'ending', 'anticlimactic', 'undramatic', 'something', 'very', 'significant', 'message', 'delivered', 'novel.Final', 'verdict', 'pretty', 'good', '3', 'stars', 'Amazon', ""n't"", 'have', 'stars', 'certainly', 'not', 'what', 'have', 'been', 'not', 'what', '*hoped*', 'reading', 'excellent', 'novel', 'based']",N/A

The first thing one will notice about the film will be the mood set via the lighting, and then of course the narrator Will Lyman, who is often used in documentaries but at times can be annoying. As a viewer you are immediately drawn into this storybook like atmosphere in a non-traditional storybook sort of setting and the quirkiness and underlying humor keeps you hooked.I also felt these actors had such depth and character, either you could relate or want to speak too and have some sort of relationship with. ""Little Children"" overflows with meaningful lives. You will come to fine out everyone struggles in this slice of modern suburbia. Sarah (Kate Winslett) is a housewife and a mother who has lost a little something in her life, passion, while her husband (Gregg Edelman) is messing around on the internet; she meets the ""prom king"" of the block, Brad, and has a deep passionate affair with him. But there is a problem, Brad (Patrick Wilson) is also married with a child as well, but their affair and love is too strong to ignore when they realize that they are what were missing in each other's lives, or are they just a fantasy they needed to fulfill? There is another character in this film named Ronnie (Jackie Earle Haley), who had a horrible reputation after exposing himself to a minor and is snubbed by the committee, but the only love of his life is his mother (incredibly talented Phyllis Somerville) who is constantly trying to get an ex cop harasser (Noah Emmerich) off her son's back.This film had some terrific performances; I was completely convinced by everyone, particularly Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson, who made a wonderful couple. The support cast, though great, didn't have a lot to work with, particularly Jennifer Connelly, as Brads wife, who did well with what she had. The children were effective and very cute. I was also very impressed by the brave perspective director Todd Field took towards sexual deviants who have served their time, showing that they are unduly victimized for almost the rest of their existence. In fact, the storyline between Ronnie and Larry, and the small offshoots, were the best part of the film, and very well done.""Little Children"" is an incredibly touching film; the ending was so beautiful and really brought true closure to the story.

When I viewed it again recently I was able to absorb some of the undercurrents I missed the first time. And undercurrents there are in droves. The story is complex and challenging but it is the film's cast that shines.Kate Winslet gives her best performance yet as Sarah, the young suburban housewife and mother, desperate for love. She meets Brad (Patrick Wilson) who is in a similar emotional boat. The two form a bond and the rest is for the audience to witness. Winslet, with her longing, soul-searching eyes is a perfect match for Wilson (played with vacuous detachment). Wilson, who reminds me of a young Paul Newman, gives a wonderful performance. Added to the fine group of actors is Jackie Earle Haley, (Ronnie) the scary sexual pervert just out of prison. The scene where we meet him in the pool is reminiscent of a film from a generation ago. Real kudos go to Phyllis Somerville, who plays Ronnie's mom. Her small role is crucial to the plot and she plays it with aplomb. The deep-voiced narrator keeps the story line together and is a welcome, reassuring addition.Everyone in this film seems to be trapped...as if they're on a faster and faster spinning carousel with no way off. In the end they all exit in tragic, but sensible ways. The title ""Little Children"" applies more to the adults, who can't seem to take responsiblity to a mature level and end up paying a huge price. The film is worth every minute of viewing and I highly recommend it.",5,"Great film, terrific cast",1180483200,"05 30, 2007",2007,1531,"['first', 'saw', 'Little', 'Children', 'January', 'thought', 'was', 'spectacular', 'When', 'viewed', 'again', 'recently', 'was', 'able', 'absorb', 'undercurrents', 'missed', 'first', 'time', 'undercurrents', 'are', 'droves', 'story', 'complex', 'challenging', 'film', 'cast', 'shines.Kate', 'Winslet', 'best', 'performance', 'yet', 'Sarah', 'young', 'suburban', 'housewife', 'mother', 'desperate', 'love', 'Brad', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'who', 'similar', 'emotional', 'boat', 'two', 'form', 'bond', 'rest', 'audience', 'witness', 'Winslet', 'longing', 'soul-searching', 'eyes', 'perfect', 'match', 'Wilson', 'played', 'vacuous', 'detachment', 'Wilson', 'who', 'young', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'Added', 'fine', 'group', 'actors', 'Jackie', 'Earle', 'Haley', 'Ronnie', 'scary', 'sexual', 'pervert', 'just', 'prison', 'scene', 'where', 'meet', 'pool', 'reminiscent', 'film', 'generation', 'ago', 'Real', 'kudos', 'go', 'Phyllis', 'Somerville', 'who', 'Ronnie', 'mom', 'small', 'role', 'crucial', 'plot', 'aplomb', 'deep-voiced', 'narrator', 'story', 'line', 'together', 'welcome', 'reassuring', 'addition.Everyone', 'film', 'be', 'trapped', ""'re"", 'faster', 'faster', 'spinning', 'carousel', 'way', 'off', 'end', 'exit', 'tragic', 'sensible', 'ways', 'title', 'Little', 'Children', 'more', 'adults', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'take', 'responsiblity', 'mature', 'level', 'end', 'up', 'paying', 'huge', 'price', 'film', 'worth', 'minute', 'viewing', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A

Some of the secondary charactars are a little weak, but all the primary players are amazing. As usual Winslet is beyond outstanding. I don't think the girl is capable of even a mediocre performance. The film runs a little long, but is forgivable because it's compelling almost all the way through. Could have done without sme of the excessive nudity however.Excellent cinematography. Balanced color palette with flesh tones natural and deep blacks. Longer takes that carry the viewer through each persons story. I wish Sarah's husband was fleshed out more and the end of the film left me a little wanting. A little too ambiguous for my taste. Overall a good film, but not for anyone under 18. The best part is it never takes a hard line view about anything and never makes excuses for the descisions made by the charactars.

1052970,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B000N3SU92,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[24, 26]","Little Children opened and received some of the best reviews of the year. Problem was, it had little press and a limited theatrical release. The 3 Academy Award nominations it received, it probably received more from word of mouth than anything. Anyway, the poster of the film intrigued me and prompted me to read the book a few months ago. Since then, I have been aching to see the film. Now, my dream has come true and I've seen it and I think it's the best film of 2006. Not only does it work purely as a film, but it's also the epitome of a great literary adaptation. It does what all the great literary adaptations have done; changed little, added less. The screenplay is by the writer of the novel, Tom Perrotta and the director of the film, Todd Field...I think this proves that maybe the novelist is best suited to adapt his own work.The film takes place in an anonymous suburb, deep in the heart of suburbia. Kate Winslet plays Sarah, a young wife and mother who has no idea what she's doing in the lifestyle that she is now in. Her day consists of taking her daughter Lucy to the park and listening to the boring chitchat of her fellow mothers. That's until she sees The Prom King (Patrick Wilson), whose real name is Brad, the stay-at-home-dad that brings his son to the park and is the object of every playground mother's affection. When the mothers bet Sarah five bucks to get his phone number, she winds up with a kiss instead...This kiss spirals into a full-on affair. Meanwhile, a convicted sex offender has moved into the neighborhood in the form of Ronnie J. McGorvey (Jackie Earle Haley) and is the victim of harassment at the hands of Larry (Noah Emmerich, whose brother is pretty high up at New Line Cinema), the head of the committee of concerned parents. Jennifer Connelly plays Kathy, Brad's wife who (he openly admits) his much more beautiful than Sarah. The movie is a straight- forward drama, but is very much a satire of suburban America that rings very true.The best part of the film is the sub-plot involving Ronnie McGorvey and you realize that, in many cases, the offender often becomes the victim. As you probably know, the favorite to win the Best Supporting Actor Oscar was Eddie Murphy but it (very) unexpectedly went to Alan Arkin. The Academy made a big mistake! Jackie Earle Haley delivered the best supporting performance of 2006 and has a truly great comeback story. This is a character that's hard to like. No matter what the crime was, no one likes a sex offender...This film really shows how unfair the treatment of them can be and Haley portrays McGorvey in a way I don't think anyone else can. The first scene he appears in and his first lines in the film (""I was only trying to cool off"") are truly haunting and effective. Kate Winslet is also inspired casting.I've read two novels by Perrotta (the other was also made into a film, 'Election') and he has no problem exposing the imperfections of his characters. ""Election"" ignored that aspect, ""Little Children"" doesn't. An actress like Angelina Jolie or Cameron Diaz would not have been able to make this character believable. The film is really just an amazing piece of work. During the entire film I kept wondering if they kept the ending from the novel. The novel ends abruptly and I didn't think it would be realistic on film. The film also ends rather abruptly and, yes; they did change the ending. In doing so, they gave a much more poignant and MUCH MORE haunting ending that is very shocking. When reading the book I noticed many instances where I thought to myself 'no way this is in the movie' and much to my surprise and enjoyment, much of it is! 90% of the book is in the movie. The only things they dropped (that are incredibly noticeable) were a sub-plot involving a past crime of McGorvey's and Sarah's husband's escapade with his obsession. It's a toss up for me trying to decide if the film is better than the book, but on a whim I want to say yes.This is a great film; A poignant, powerful, haunting, sometimes funny film. It's absolutely brilliant and the finest piece of filmmaking to come out of 2006.GRADE: A",5,The Best Film of 2006,1178150400,"05 3, 2007",2007,4128,"['Little', 'Children', 'opened', 'received', 'best', 'reviews', 'year', 'Problem', 'was', 'had', 'little', 'press', 'limited', 'theatrical', 'release', '3', 'Academy', 'Award', 'received', 'probably', 'received', 'more', 'word', 'mouth', 'anything', 'Anyway', 'poster', 'film', 'intrigued', 'prompted', 'read', 'book', 'few', 'months', 'ago', 'then', 'have', 'been', 'aching', 'see', 'film', 'Now', 'dream', 'come', 'true', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'think', 'best', 'film', '2006', 'Not', 'only', 'work', 'purely', 'film', 'also', 'epitome', 'great', 'literary', 'adaptation', 'what', 'great', 'literary', 'adaptations', 'have', 'done', 'changed', 'little', 'added', 'less', 'screenplay', 'writer', 'novel', 'Tom', 'Perrotta', 'director', 'film', 'Todd', 'Field', 'think', 'maybe', 'novelist', 'best', 'suited', 'adapt', 'own', 'work.The', 'film', 'place', 'anonymous', 'suburb', 'deep', 'heart', 'suburbia', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Sarah', 'young', 'wife', 'mother', 'who', 'idea', 'what', 'doing', 'lifestyle', 'now', 'day', 'taking', 'daughter', 'Lucy', 'park', 'listening', 'boring', 'chitchat', 'fellow', 'mothers', 'Prom', 'King', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'real', 'name', 'Brad', 'stay-at-home-dad', 'son', 'park', 'object', 'playground', 'mother', 'affection', 'When', 'mothers', 'bet', 'Sarah', 'five', 'bucks', 'get', 'phone', 'number', 'up', 'kiss', 'instead', 'kiss', 'spirals', 'full-on', 'affair', 'Meanwhile', 'convicted', 'sex', 'offender', 'moved', 'neighborhood', 'form', 'Ronnie', 'J.', 'McGorvey', 'Jackie', 'Earle', 'Haley', 'victim', 'harassment', 'hands', 'Larry', 'Noah', 'Emmerich', 'brother', 'pretty', 'high', 'up', 'New', 'Line', 'Cinema', 'head', 'committee', 'concerned', 'parents', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'Kathy', 'Brad', 'wife', 'who', 'openly', 'much', 'more', 'beautiful', 'Sarah', 'movie', 'straight-', 'forward', 'drama', 'very', 'much', 'satire', 'suburban', 'America', 'very', 'true.The', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'sub-plot', 'involving', 'Ronnie', 'McGorvey', 'realize', 'many', 'cases', 'offender', 'often', 'victim', 'probably', 'know', 'favorite', 'win', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'was', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'very', 'unexpectedly', 'went', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'Academy', 'made', 'big', 'mistake', 'Jackie', 'Earle', 'Haley', 'delivered', 'best', 'supporting', 'performance', '2006', 'truly', 'great', 'comeback', 'story', 'character', 'hard', 'like', 'matter', 'what', 'crime', 'was', 'one', 'sex', 'offender', 'film', 'really', 'how', 'unfair', 'treatment', 'can', 'be', 'Haley', 'portrays', 'McGorvey', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'else', 'can', 'first', 'scene', 'first', 'lines', 'film', 'was', 'only', 'trying', 'cool', 'off', 'are', 'truly', 'haunting', 'effective', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'also', 'inspired', 'casting.I', ""'ve"", 'read', 'two', 'novels', 'Perrotta', 'other', 'was', 'also', 'made', 'film', ""'Election"", 'problem', 'exposing', 'imperfections', 'characters', 'Election', 'ignored', 'aspect', 'Little', 'Children', ""n't"", 'actress', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'make', 'character', 'believable', 'film', 'really', 'just', 'amazing', 'piece', 'work', 'entire', 'film', 'kept', 'wondering', 'kept', 'ending', 'novel', 'novel', 'ends', 'abruptly', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'be', 'realistic', 'film', 'film', 'also', 'rather', 'abruptly', 'yes', 'did', 'change', 'ending', 'doing', 'so', 'gave', 'much', 'more', 'poignant', 'MUCH', 'MORE', 'haunting', 'ending', 'very', 'shocking', 'When', 'reading', 'book', 'noticed', 'many', 'instances', 'where', 'thought', 'myself', ""'no"", 'way', 'movie', 'much', 'surprise', 'enjoyment', 'much', '90', '%', 'book', 'movie', 'only', 'things', 'dropped', 'are', 'incredibly', 'noticeable', 'were', 'sub-plot', 'involving', 'past', 'crime', 'McGorvey', 'Sarah', 'husband', 'escapade', 'obsession', 'toss', 'up', 'trying', 'decide', 'film', 'better', 'book', 'whim', 'want', 'say', 'yes.This', 'great', 'film', 'A', 'poignant', 'powerful', 'haunting', 'sometimes', 'funny', 'film', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'finest', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'come', '2006.GRADE', 'A']",N/A

1052973,A3OP9CU8GUWI03,B000N3SU92,"J. Ridgway ""Ridge""","[4, 6]","Definitely entertaining, but if this is an accurate portrayal of American sexuality in the Middle Class, then we're in big trouble!  In particular, I can imagine foreigners watching this movie and thinking how pathetic the American people are..... So I think it gives a biased and negatively-slanted portrait of American lives.  Of course, any devout Muslims who see this probably are thinking what a despicable culture we have!  (ie it's not a very good advertisement for free, Western society.)I'm tempted to compare it to American Beauty (which I loathed), but this movie, while skewering the sexual lives and problems of suburban Americans, somehow makes me feel less angry than AB, because I don't think that it has such an obvious, destructive political agenda.  BUT, there are no normal, healthy or happy married sexual relationships going on.  The men in the movie are particularly pathetic.  Like AB, it provides a ""God's Eye"" viewpoint into everyone's private lives, thoughts and sexual lives. (There is a narrator who has the God's Eye view, who ties everything together.) Some other similarities are that it is based in a middle-class white suburb, it's protagonist is a guy who is likewise regressing back into adolescence and irresponsibility, it has a convoluted and interesting plot (with a nice twist of an ending), and it uses good (and some big-name) actors.  It also was nominated for Academy awards.But the sex lives are pathetic, for the men in particular.  One guy is an internet porn-addict (neglecting his wife in the process), another is cheating on his wife with a married woman, the third is a just-released child molester (who is not cured), and a fourth just got kicked out of his house by his wife.  (A few side characters that are thrown in, are a closet transvestite and a guy that trolls for gay sex at rest stops).  Pathetic.  But they seem like they're (just barely) holding the rest of their lives together, and the plot gets advanced in an entertaining and suspenseful way.The women seem either very ""boxed in,"" rigid and judgemental, or, like the heroine (Kate Winslett) break out of their mold and pay the price for it.  There's also a scene with a bunch of older feminist battle-axes with short hair, talking about Madam Bovary and complaining about men.  Which makes one think, ""Where are all the happily married men and women???""  This is one reason why I rate it only 3 stars.The positive energy is that of all the parents represented, they seem to love their children and pay a lot of attention to them, and they realize in the end that when they act irresponsibly (in the affair) they are putting their children at risk.  The movie thus doesn't have QUITE the poisonous feel of AB in that the characters are basically good people who make mistakes and realize it in the end.  Also, it admits that children are a real and very important part of adult's lives (unlike 90% of most other Hollywood movies).&lt; Spoilers Below >BTW there is adult sex shown in the movie that is almost close to a porn shot while still being R rated.  I guess if you are a female fan of Patrick Wilson, the buff protagonist, you won't mind that, but to many it will seem over-the-top. The scene where the child molester masturbates while on a date is also pretty damn disturbing (but thankfully it's not explicitly shown).I don't like the fact that there is no noble male figure in the entire movie.  The cop who harrasses the pedophile COULD be made out to be a civic-conscious, decent character, but the movie makes him out to be an obsessed loser who has too many of his own problems.  Thus it's a lot like American Beauty in that it's very critical of contemporary American, white, suburban culture.  The cop in the end becomes a ""tolerant good guy,"" in what is truly an unexpected final twist.Altogether it's a combination of disturbing and entertaining, and makes you think, ""If this is anywhere's near the truth about the sexuality among our middle-class society today, we're in a BIG heap of trouble!!!!""",3,"Entertaining, but if This is Accurate, America's in Trouble!",1265846400,"02 11, 2010",2010,4035,"['Definitely', 'entertaining', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'American', 'sexuality', 'Middle', 'Class', 'then', ""'re"", 'big', 'trouble', 'particular', 'can', 'imagine', 'foreigners', 'watching', 'movie', 'thinking', 'how', 'pathetic', 'American', 'people', 'are', '..', 'think', 'biased', 'negatively-slanted', 'portrait', 'American', 'lives', 'course', 'devout', 'Muslims', 'who', 'see', 'probably', 'are', 'thinking', 'what', 'despicable', 'culture', 'have', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'advertisement', 'free', 'Western', 'society', ""'m"", 'tempted', 'compare', 'American', 'Beauty', 'loathed', 'movie', 'skewering', 'sexual', 'lives', 'problems', 'suburban', 'Americans', 'somehow', 'feel', 'less', 'angry', 'AB', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'such', 'obvious', 'destructive', 'political', 'agenda', 'BUT', 'are', 'normal', 'healthy', 'happy', 'married', 'sexual', 'relationships', 'going', 'men', 'movie', 'are', 'particularly', 'pathetic', 'AB', 'God', 'Eye', 'viewpoint', 'everyone', 'private', 'lives', 'thoughts', 'sexual', 'lives', 'narrator', 'who', 'God', 'Eye', 'view', 'who', 'everything', 'together', 'other', 'similarities', 'are', 'based', 'middle-class', 'white', 'suburb', 'protagonist', 'guy', 'who', 'likewise', 'regressing', 'back', 'adolescence', 'irresponsibility', 'convoluted', 'interesting', 'plot', 'nice', 'twist', 'ending', 'good', 'big-name', 'actors', 'also', 'was', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'awards.But', 'sex', 'lives', 'are', 'pathetic', 'men', 'particular', 'One', 'guy', 'internet', 'porn-addict', 'neglecting', 'wife', 'process', 'cheating', 'wife', 'married', 'woman', 'third', 'just-released', 'child', 'molester', 'who', 'not', 'cured', 'fourth', 'just', 'got', 'kicked', 'house', 'wife', 'few', 'side', 'characters', 'are', 'thrown', 'are', 'closet', 'transvestite', 'guy', 'gay', 'sex', 'rest', 'stops', 'Pathetic', 'seem', ""'re"", 'just', 'barely', 'holding', 'rest', 'lives', 'together', 'plot', 'advanced', 'entertaining', 'suspenseful', 'way.The', 'women', 'seem', 'very', 'boxed', 'rigid', 'judgemental', 'heroine', 'Kate', 'Winslett', 'break', 'mold', 'pay', 'price', 'also', 'scene', 'bunch', 'older', 'feminist', 'battle-axes', 'short', 'hair', 'talking', 'Madam', 'Bovary', 'complaining', 'men', 'Which', 'one', 'think', 'Where', 'are', 'happily', 'married', 'men', 'women', 'one', 'reason', 'why', 'rate', 'only', '3', 'stars.The', 'positive', 'energy', 'parents', 'represented', 'seem', 'love', 'children', 'pay', 'lot', 'attention', 'realize', 'end', 'when', 'act', 'irresponsibly', 'affair', 'are', 'putting', 'children', 'risk', 'movie', 'thus', ""n't"", 'have', 'QUITE', 'poisonous', 'feel', 'AB', 'characters', 'are', 'basically', 'good', 'people', 'who', 'make', 'mistakes', 'realize', 'end', 'Also', 'children', 'are', 'real', 'very', 'important', 'part', 'adult', 'lives', '90', '%', 'most', 'other', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'lt', 'Spoilers', 'Below', '>', 'BTW', 'adult', 'sex', 'shown', 'movie', 'almost', 'close', 'porn', 'shot', 'still', 'being', 'R', 'rated', 'guess', 'are', 'female', 'fan', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'buff', 'protagonist', 'wo', ""n't"", 'mind', 'many', 'will', 'seem', 'over-the-top', 'scene', 'where', 'child', 'molester', 'masturbates', 'date', 'also', 'pretty', 'damn', 'disturbing', 'thankfully', 'not', 'explicitly', 'shown', '.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'fact', 'noble', 'male', 'figure', 'entire', 'movie', 'cop', 'who', 'pedophile', 'COULD', 'be', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'civic-conscious', 'decent', 'character', 'movie', 'out', 'be', 'obsessed', 'loser', 'who', 'too', 'many', 'own', 'problems', 'Thus', 'lot', 'American', 'Beauty', 'very', 'critical', 'contemporary', 'American', 'white', 'suburban', 'culture', 'cop', 'end', 'tolerant', 'good', 'guy', 'what', 'truly', 'unexpected', 'final', 'twist.Altogether', 'combination', 'disturbing', 'entertaining', 'think', 'anywhere', 'truth', 'sexuality', 'middle-class', 'society', 'today', ""'re"", 'BIG', 'heap', 'trouble']",N/A

I guess it's okay, but not if you're expecting something special, and it ends with a disastrous 1-2-3-4 punch of narrative surprises all four of which are dramatic duds.  To be fair one woman was weeping her eyes out at the end, crying over the perfidy of men, but I asked her later in the lobby if she was okay, and she said that she found the movie overwhelmingly similar to her own life, for although she gave no details you could tell she had had an extramarital affair herself, with one of her own students in a college classroom.  And this guy had really let her down.  But really, has anything changed since the great days of Somerset Maugham and his story, ""Rain,"" about the South Seas prostitute whom an evangelical missionary attempts to convert to the ways of the Lord?If you'll remember, RAIN ends triumphantly with Sadie Thompson crying in the middle of the monsoon, ""I tol' yas, men are nothin' but pigs!""  Here the message is almost exactly the same.  Whether you're Patrick Wilson, more interested in ogling the speedboy skaters clattering up and down the ramp than you are in pursuing your affair; or you're Kate Winslet's husband, hooked on a jolly internet femme called ""Slutty Kay"" to the point of buying her underwear to wear on his face; or maybe you're Jackie Earle Haley, a pedophile with severe problems with women, no matter which man you are in this movie, you're a pig and you might as well admit it.I almost forgot about Noah Emmerich, who plays Larry Hedges.  He plays a disgraced cop who bullies an old lady and attacks an unarmed teen.  He screams and yells his way all through the movie acting out the vigilante impulses of his neighbors in the little town.  Has there been any broader acting done this year?  It's like the director had access to a blender into which he could stuff Jack Weston, Brian Dennehy, and Charles Durning, then slam it to ""on,"" pump up the volume, and spill the boisterous bluster all over the screen and call it a ""Noah Emmerich.""  What did I like?  More than I should I found myself enjoying the scenes where Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson have sex (on the washer/dryer, or under a closed attic window on a hot summer afternoon), Wilson almost loses that honey glaze he was born with as he stands thrusting, his enormous butt expanding and contracting like some sort of surrealistic cristacean, directly in the camera's eye.

1052983,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000N3SU92,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 3]","The title of ""Little Children"" is obviously ironic since the young adults who make up the film's main characters are clearly being characterized as such by novelist Tom Perrotta.  The author's judgments are of such importance to the telling ot the tale that director Todd Field, who did the screenplay with Perrotta, uses a narrator (Will Lyman, narrator of numerous PBS ""NOVA"" and ""Frontline"") to both express the inner thoughts of silent characters and to pass additional judgments.  I was not especially enamored of this approach, which substitutes telling for showing at several points, but the touches of sardonic wit eventually won me over.  However, the same cannot be said for most of the characters, which is actually a key part of the story.Sarah Pierce (Kate Winslet) takes her daughter to the local suburban playground each day, where she listens to the gossip of the other young mothers, who have two primary topics.  The first is the stay-at-home dad, Brad Adamson (Patrick Wilson), who has recently returned after a mysterious absence to show up at the playground with his young son.  They call him the ""Prom King,"" and when one of them bets Sarah $5 that she cannot gets the guy's phone number, Sarah gets a lot more than that.  The second omnipresent topic is the release from prison of a pedophile, Ronnie J. McGorvey (Jackie Earle Haley), who has moved into the neighborhood to live with his mother, May (Phyllis Somerville).  Ronnie exposed himself to a young girl and ex-cop Larry Hedges (Noah Emmerich) has taken it upon himself to do more than just put up posters all over town warning parents about the sexual predator living in the neighborhood.It is the reaction of the neighbors to Ronnie that first clues us in that this slice of suburbia is just another Peyton Place and that these characters are all hypocrites, because the hysterical reaction strikes me as just such overkill.  If this is what they do to somebody who exposes himself, then you have to wonder what they would consider appropriate for someone guilty of more wretched molestation.  When Ronnie finally appears there is clearly evidence that he has not changed, just as everybody fears, but there is also a scene that I think makes it equally clear Ronnie wants to be seen and not to touch.  This only serves to reinforce the idea that these other characters should not be throwing stones, let alone judging others, and that this collision of characters is not going to end well.Brad is married to Kathy (Jennifer Connelly), who is preoccupied with her career as a documentary film making and blithely unaware of what she is doing to her husband by suggesting he does not really ""need"" his magazine subscriptions.  Meanwhile, Sarah's husband, Richard (Gregg Edelman), has become smitten with an Internet sex site.  With their spouses adding to the inevitability of their affair, Brad and Sarah attempt to fill up the voids in their lives, while their neighbors continue to pass judgment on each other.  Mary Ann (Mary B. McCann) is clearly the most judgmental of the playground mothers, although her character is apparently not as prominent as she is in the novel.  What is important is that the characters are so busy passing judgments on each other they remain oblivious to their own failings until they are forcibly confronted by them.Winslet and Haley were Oscar nominated for their roles, but their fine performances do not stand out notably so in this ensemble piece, where I found Sommerville and Emmerich to be equally strong.  In the wake of the success of ""Pulp Fiction"" there were a whole slew of movies that scrambled up their chronological narratives in imitations of Quentin Tarrantino's film.  It seems that the Oscar winning film ""Crash"" is becoming a similar source of emulation with all of these films that offer a fateful collision of characters with their varying degrees of separation (Not that ""Crash"" was the first film to do this sort of thing but rather than it has become the cinematic reference point for that particular approach).  I wondered how ""Babel"" would have done at the Academy Awards if it did not seem so ""Crash""-like, and was surprised by the final reel to discover that ""Little Children"" was even more like Paul Haggis's film.  You regard for this similarity might be a stronger indicator of your predisposition for or against this particular film.However, I also found myself being remind of ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.""  I have always wondered why the super-intelligent Khan would start quoting Ahab from ""Moby Dick,"" seemingly embracing the whole idea of self-destructive obsession.  In ""Little Children"" Sarah sits in on a neighborhood book club that has read ""Madame Bovary,"" and finds herself identifying with Emma's plight, even though the group has explicitly talked about the character's suicide.  Maybe if she had finished her dissertation she would know better, but Sarah is obviously trying to ignore the obvious and painful parallels.  I can understand wanting to be with Emma Bovary (e.g., Woody Allen's ""The Kugelmass Episode""), or discovering that your situation is precariously similar (e.g., Kate Chopin's ""The Awakening""), but actively embracing such a fate is quite disconcerting.  That is probably why I found the resolution of this 2006 film to be somewhat refreshing in that it did not play out exactly as anticipated.",5,You should never have children until you stop being one

It is not always possible to see all of the films when they come to the theatre, so I try to see as many on DVD as I can.  But that list keeps getting longer and some films end up getting lost.  Such would have been the case of Little Children--had I not picked it up because it had entered the $1 rack at my local Blockbuster.  And what a stunning surprise it was.  From the very opening to the extraordinary conclusion, I found myself watching it nearly spellbound.  There is both a hypnotic and horrifying quality to this satire--an odd but successful combination.  Kate Winslet has never been better and Patrick Wilson is nearly perfect as Brad, ""The Prom-King.""  Jennifer Connelly, though she has limited screen time, is equally amazing to watch.  And Jackie Earle Haley as the ""lives in the neighborhood"" sex offender is simply breathtaking.  (It was another Amazon reviewer that helped me remember him from ""Breaking Away"" one of my favorite cycling films of all time.)  Little Children haunted me long after the final note of the very powerful musical score had sounded.  I would highly recommend that you not miss out on this film--as I nearly did.One mildly negative note.  This is one of those DVD's where I actually wanted a collection of "" extras"" but where there are none provided.

1052985,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B000N3SU92,Lee Armstrong,"[1, 2]","""Little Children"" captured my imagination.  I found the characters fascinating.  Each person seemed to be so isolated, living inside their head.  Todd Field who directed the bold and dramatic ""In the Bedroom"" does an incredible job.  He and book author Tom Perrotta deservedly earned Oscar nominations for Best Adapted Screenplay.  Sarah Pierce played by Kate Winslet loves her daughter, but isn't having much fun at being a mommy or a wife.  Her husband has his own private life lurking at internet websites and ordering worn panties in the mail to spur his fantasy life.  Both are incredibly isolated.  Contrast this to the other couple with Jennifer Connelly playing Kathy Adamson who is lost in her work as a documentary filmmaker and so wrapped up in being a mommy that their child sleeps in their bed, literally creating a barrier between husband and wife.  Patrick Wilson, who is also very good in ""Evening"" with Claire Danes, Vanessa Redgrave & Glenn Close, plays Brad, a young stay-at-home father who has twice failed the bar exam to become a lawyer.  He isn't certain he wants to be a lawyer and spends evenings watching skateboarding teenagers.  The park where they meet is populated with judgmental urban wives who call Brad the ""prom king"" because he's a good-looking young father who fuels their fantasies.  Marsha Dietlein Bennett in her second film (""Little Manhattan"") plays the blonde Cheryl who is hysterical in her chronic put-downs of everyone else.  She's the kind of person who really couldn't think of anything nice to say about anyone.  Then we meet the sex offender Ronnie who moves back into the neighborhood after two years in prison.  Again, we meet a clinically isolated man, unable to socialize, living inside his head.  Jackie Earl Haley who was in ""The Bad News Bears"" years ago and recently in ""All the King's Men"" earned his first Oscar nomination as well as film critics awards in Chicago, Dallas-Ft. Worth, New York, Oklahoma & the Southeastern Film Critics' Circle.  Larry Hedges is the policeman who assumes a vendetta against Ronnie, which climaxes at the film's finale.  Noah Emmerich from ""Cellular"" & ""Crazy in Alabama"" plays the cop who is also isolated & whose world is falling apart.This was one of the Oscar-nominated films that never played in our little town.  I wanted to see Kate Winslet's Oscar-nominated performance, which earned her fifth nomination.  In fact, she had nine nominations at festivals around the country and world for ""Little Children,"" but remained winless.  Phyllis Somerville who was in ""Swim Fan"" does a tremendous cameo as Ronnie's mother, May McGorvey.  I was touched by how sincerely both Brad and Sarah loved their children, despite feeling trapped by their roles as parents.  The laundry room affair was shocking with its intense explosion of desire.""Little Children"" was excellent because there were no clear good guys or bad guys.  It shows everyone living inside dreams in their head while trying hard to cope with the world around them.  As a result, it came across as extremely realistic.

I believe that rapists and pedophiles should be chemically castrated. I am not excusing his criminal behavior, but I'm referring to the ending and his relationship with his mother (the only one in the world who loved him).  He was a pathetic character, a perverted character, but his mother's home did not deserve to be defaced like it was. His mother did not deserve the ex-policeman's harassment.  I felt even more sympathy for his mother - she just wanted him to be a good boy and find a nice girl his own age. I lost all hope for him when he scared his blind date away.  And his final scenes in the house and playground were just brutal.A gloomy monster of a movie, disturbing and very thought-provoking.  As for the adulterers, Brad (Patrick Wilson) and Sarah (Kate Winslet), I felt that they were quite stupid, but at the same time I didn't want them to get caught. What idiots though, at times! Why were they making out in the bright lights of the football field and not under the bleachers? I felt sure that Brad's wife would find them at any moment. And then there were Brad's obvious lies to his wife about not remembering Sarah's name, and Sarah's obvious attachment to him by asking him certain questions at the dinner table (""You never told me that!"" right in front of Brad's wife!).I liked the book group discussion very much.  Sarah stuck up for Madame Bovary because she rebelled against society, she had hunger. One of the suburban moms made a good point when she said, ""Does that mean cheating on your husband makes you a feminist?""  Sarah answered No. But of course Sarah can empathize with Madame Bovary because she is also an adulterer and felt trapped, suffocated in her boring life. She is not very maternal either. One could also compare Sarah to Anna Karenina, although Anna left her child to be with Vronsky, while Sarah took Lucy with her.  I once thought of Anna Karenina as a great feminist heroine, doing what she did for love and not caring what society thought. She broke free. But as I've grown older, I realize that Anna became more entrapped as she entered the affair. I still love her character and admire some of her qualities, but to leave her child for another man is not love. It is selfishness. I am not the most maternal person either, and I don't even have children - but after I read ""One True Thing"" by Anna Quindlen, my opinions about Anna Karenina changed. If you've read that book you'll understand.Enjoyed the soothing voice of the narrator and the dreary soundtrack. I plan to read the book on which the movie is based...and I am going to reread Madame Bovary.

It's set in suburbia, where Kate Winslet is a stay-at-home mom. The film opens with a playground scene which is satirical, humorous and very very real, with the added device of  a male narrator adding insight to the small minded women surrounding Winslet.  Then there is Patrick Wilson, cast as a stay-at-home husband while his wife, Jennifer Connoly, supports the family.  Yes, Kate and Patrick do eventually get together, but there is a lot more to the film than that.Central to the story is the fact that a convicted pedophile, played by Ronald James McCorvey, has just been released from jail.  He's living with his mother in a small house in the neighborhood.  Everyone in the town is incensed and he and his mother are made miserable by the constant threats and spray painting on their driveway.  McCorvey is outstanding in this role.  There's a lot of creepiness.  But he's a human being after all and is driven by forces he doesn't understand.  His mother tries to help him.  She even sets him up with a date with a woman.  How that all plays out is fascinating and inevitable.This is a film that mixes its dark themes with a bit of humor and calls for subtly in the screenplay and the acting.  Frankly, it's perfect.

Eskildson ""Pragmatist""","[4, 4]","The movie is definitely not for young children, but about characters and crisis around them, as they grow and play in a straight-laced American suburb.  A voice narrates ""Little Children""  the movie off and on.  Some scenes the narration is a plus, and others you feel talked down to.  However, by performances and plot, the movie grabs you.""Little Children"" shines light on hypocrisy in everyday suburbia lives.  It shows our tendencies to feel superior to the people we label as guilty of sins.  Oftentimes we are guilty of sins of different sorts.  There are four characters to watch - a wife who cheats on her husband, a husband who cheats on his wife, a pedophile living with his mother, a messed up cop.  They are all interesting characters who do things out of public view, but know their sins as they talk of others.What is intriguing is that we get to observe the two-faced characters, who also observe each other.  There are children playing throughout - on the playground, at home, and in the swimming pool.  They see and interact as the adults and parents go in and out of affairs.  The main affair is between Sarah Pierce (Kate Winslet) who has an affair with a stay at home dad, Brad (Patrick Wilson).  They progress in a relationship you think will end with them getting divorced and moving on -  however a wacky ending will make you wonder if this was the same couple at the beginnign of the movie.Along with the adult affairs, there is a story about the neighborhood's child molester.  His name is Ronnie played superbly by Jackie Earl Haley.  Ronnie is a mother's boy and shielded and cared for by her when he comes home from prison.  Somehow he becomes forgivable as her love for him never fades.  She is optimistic about his future..  He is hated by the neighbors who were shown on the news saying they did not want him in their neighborhood.  We soon realize that he is not the only one who has hurt a child.Overall is is good drama highlighting lies we tell ourselves to make things right.

1052992,A2ULSA0IRUE09E,B000N3SU92,Marc Cabir Davis,"[10, 19]","This 2006 film is notable for a few things. This review will highlight a few points to remember in case you wanted to pick up the DVD. This is by no means a perfect movie, but it certainly is one with its' share of highs. If you thought Kate Winslet was a high, you're wrong. In my estimation, this usually wonderful actress is at her woeful worst here, in a performance even worse than her one in ""Holy Smoke"".1. Patrick Wilson : The leading man is the best thing about this film. Not only does he have `the whole package', he is by far the most credible thing about this motion picture. Patrick has always interested me (remember him from ""The Phantom of the Opera""), but he transcends his imposing physical beauty here to deliver a knockout acting performance as a hen-pecked husband who can't leave his wife for his mistress. Absolutely flawless, and the only downside is that the movie didn't focus only on him2. Kate Winslet : Kate Kate Kate. Normally wise Kate shot herself in the foot with this abysmal performance. The role was badly written (read the book instead - Kate's character is far livelier and more exciting, a bisexual even!) and Kate's signature grimace and dowdiness are given centerstage prominence. Not that this would be out of place in this film, but we've seen her play this before, many a time. I was constantly reminded of her dreary performance in ""Iris"" while watching this. Not sure why she was nominated for an Oscar for this one, but on the upside, this British actress sports a fine American accent here, so its worth checking out just for that.3. The storyline : This is quite simply, a story about two married people who meet in a park, fall in lust (not in love), and then get ready to elope, only to have circumstances deny them the pleasure of it. Not much to write home about, and you're right, if you're not the kind of person who likes conversation in a movie, please skip this film entirely4. The controversial ""pedophile"" angle : The film gained notoriety for a scandalous storyline that involves a pedophile entering the neighbourhood, eventually publicly castrating himself (not very graphic, but still disturbing). I found his presence disturbing and a little `forced', especially in one excruciating scene when he is on a date with a mentally challenged woman (a disgusting scene, you shouldn't watch this if you're not into that sort of thing)5. The End : The film ends with no resolution, which is fine, but theres a whole feeling of ""WHY OH WHY did they have to make this?"" at the end of it. Granted its based on a book, but still.If you like Patrick Wilson, get this movie no questions asked. Without a doubt he is one of the most luminous actors in our midst today and he sets the screen alight everytime he is on it. Jennifer Connelly on the other hand, surfaces here every half hour for a few minutes, with no real credible dialogue or scene to talk much about. She is, as they say, `wasted' in a poorly written role.This was an above-average film, to be sure, but to me it seemed like a very distant poor cousin of ""American Beauty"". Watch it, and you'll see what I mean.Three Stars for the film. Five stars for Patrick Wilson.

1052993,A20YK8VEEOIJQE,B000N3SU92,"Mark C. Jones ""Be Cool""","[0, 0]","This movie reminded me of the movie Brief Encounter. On the surface, they couldn't be more different. Little Children is very explicit, whereas Brief Encounter strives mightily to ignore any hint of impropriety. But both movies make the same mistake: they want us to believe each pair of philandering lovers is special when really they aren't. In a way I admire Little Children more because it--unlike Brief Encounter--admits that the attraction between these two is largely sexual. I think, however, that the writer/director wants us to believe that the tryst between Winslet and Wilson was motivated by the oppressive tedium of suburban life. I think another explanation is that some people--especially 30-something yuppies--just happen to get bored and randy now and then. This latter possibility is never explored fully. The implication at the end that there's no need for Winslet and Wilson to tell their spouses about their philandering because they chose to break it off and because they've both learned a lot spiritually, is offensive to me. We don't know because the movie ends without letting us know.Jackie Earle Haley has the painful and unfortunate role of a child molester who ultimately represents the movie's central irony: he can't control his destructive and illicit desires; the rest of the characters, in contrast, can and should control theirs. To this movie's target 30-something yuppie audience, that irony might seem like a revelation. The rest of us, however, learned to think with our brains and not the other thing once out of high school.Acting, cinematography, production values are all top notch--but the movie's values are wobbly and hollow at the core.",4,The Sexual Peccadilloes of the Bourgeoisie,1400371200,"05 18, 2014",2014,1684,"['movie', 'reminded', 'movie', 'Brief', 'Encounter', 'surface', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'different', 'Little', 'Children', 'very', 'explicit', 'whereas', 'Brief', 'Encounter', 'mightily', 'ignore', 'hint', 'impropriety', 'movies', 'make', 'same', 'mistake', 'want', 'believe', 'pair', 'philandering', 'lovers', 'special', 'when', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'way', 'admire', 'Little', 'Children', 'more', 'Brief', 'Encounter', 'attraction', 'two', 'largely', 'sexual', 'think', 'however', 'writer/director', 'believe', 'tryst', 'Winslet', 'Wilson', 'was', 'motivated', 'oppressive', 'tedium', 'suburban', 'life', 'think', 'explanation', 'people', 'especially', '30-something', 'yuppies', 'just', 'happen', 'get', 'bored', 'randy', 'now', 'then', 'latter', 'possibility', 'never', 'explored', 'fully', 'implication', 'end', 'need', 'Winslet', 'Wilson', 'tell', 'spouses', 'philandering', 'chose', 'break', 'off', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'lot', 'spiritually', 'offensive', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'movie', 'letting', 'know.Jackie', 'Earle', 'Haley', 'painful', 'unfortunate', 'role', 'child', 'molester', 'who', 'ultimately', 'movie', 'central', 'irony', 'ca', ""n't"", 'control', 'destructive', 'illicit', 'desires', 'rest', 'characters', 'contrast', 'can', 'should', 'control', 'movie', 'target', '30-something', 'yuppie', 'audience', 'irony', 'might', 'seem', 'revelation', 'rest', 'however', 'learned', 'think', 'brains', 'not', 'other', 'thing', 'once', 'high', 'school.Acting', 'cinematography', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'movie', 'values', 'are', 'wobbly', 'hollow', 'core']",N/A
1052994,A3U3BEZMH3F01Q,B000N3SU92,maskirovka,"[2, 2]","""Little Children"" is not likely a movie I'm going to watch again and again, but I am glad to have watched it at least once because of the pleasure I derive from watching Kate Winslet play another interesting character.  Sometimes, I think her charisma, sex appeal, and force of character are so great, it wouldn't be boring listening to her recite a list of fertilizer ingredients...but then I snap back to reality.&lt;spoilers>""Little Children"" doesn't have that much of a plot.  A bored housewife named Sarah (played by Winslet) with a loser husband ""meets cute"" with Brad (Todd in the book), a handsome but passive ""househusband"" who has a beautiful but cold wife.  At first, you almost believe that the two characters can pull off what Billy Crystal in ""When Harry Met Sally"" said was impossible ... a platonic, close friendship, but then there's that moment in the laundry room in Sarah's home that gives the movie a well-deserved R-rating (and several other moments as well).One lesson people can take away from watching this movie is that sometimes, ""good"" people can drift into adultery without really meaning to and that it's easy to be caught up in the excitement of the affair, but usually, there's a moment where the lovers return to Earth.High points for the movie include just about any scene Winslet's character is in and the chemistry she has with the actor playing Brad.  That chemistry is present any time they are together and not just when they are having sex.This being said...the movie is not for everyone's taste.  The subplot of the neighborhood being rightly disturbed about the return of a sex offender to the neighborhood has several very unpleasant scenes in it.Also, it's a bit of reach when the narrator refers to Winslet as being ""not that attractive.""  Despite what People Magazine may say in silly articles titled ""the 50 Most Beautiful People in the World,"" Winslet is not some ravishing beauty like Angelina Jolie.  Frankly, I think she is pretty (both as an actress and as the character in this movie) but in  a natural and wholesome way.  Given the fact that she once again delivers what I think is a faultless American accent, she comes across as an ""all-American girl"" who looks wonderful in the red swimsuit she purchases on a lark.There are two points in the story where I found myself wondering ""What would happen or people think if the characters in question did this in real life?""  The first concerns Brad's habit of staring at some teenagers skateboarding each night while he mourns his lost youth.  In real life in a town on edge about a sex offender being in its midst, I have a feeling people would find him doing that rather creepy.  The second concerns the ex-cop who discovers that the sex offender has castrated himself and rushes him to a hospital.  Given the fact that the ex-cop had been steadily harassing and threatening this man and this was publicly known, I found myself wondering if the first reaction of the authorities might have been to suspect that the ex-cop had done the damage and not the pervert himself.Another flaw to the storyline is that the plot ends abruptly and we're left wondering what happened to the characters after the main drama ended.  The book does provide more details&lt;differences between the book and the movie>The book has more detail on both the main characters.  In it, Sarah is depicted as being a rather plain looking woman (which makes me think that if they had wanted to be absolutely faithful to the book, someone like Meryl Streep if she had been young enough would have been better for the role...but I didn't find Winslet playing Sarah improbable).  We get more details about what a loser Sarah's porn-addicted husband is, and I found myself not very interested in reading about how he went on a pilgrimage to California to meet up with the very strange ""Slutty Kay"" who became the object of his obsessions.  The ex-cop who persecutes the pedophile in the story is also given more dimension as is Mary Ann who is Sarah's antagonist.The ending is different as well.  In the movie, the clear suggestion is that both Sarah and Brad decided that running off together was not a good idea.  The movie also showed Brad's wife having strong suspicions of an affair but not certain knowledge (and we see her rushing to her husband's side after he is injured trying a stunt with a skateboard).In the book, Brad decides after his accident that running off with Sarah would have been a mistake.  Sarah, however, is heartbroken when she realizes that Brad doesn't want to divorce his wife and marry her.Still another important difference is that the pedophile in the book confesses (or at least appears to confess) to a murder of a little girl who was going ""to tell on him.""  This was not in the film.  Unlike in the film, he does not castrate himself in an effort to ""be a good boy"" as his mother asked him to be from her death bed.&lt;Speculation about What Might Have Happened after the Rather Abrupt Ending>Despite the fact that Brad and Sarah were ""misbehaving"" I have to confess I rather liked them as characters and a couple, and I found myself wondering what would have happened (or what I would have liked to have happened after the story ended).Frankly, I think that Brad might have found out that his marriage was over despite his apparent belief that he could return to his wife after his summer fling had ended.  Besides cheating on her, he also had lied to her a great deal about his desire to become a lawyer, culminating in him going off for a weekend with Sarah when he was supposed to have been taking the bar exam. I think it would be much easier to forgive someone who strayed once (a one night stand on a business trip) than forgive someone who engaged in a significant affair and lied a fair amount about it and other things.As for Sarah, I figure that she might have had her heart temporarily broken by Brad's no-show in the playground, but she'd get over it and get used to being a single mom and hopefully meet some nice guy who was single.But I suppose the ending after the ending I would have liked to have seen would have been her and Brad finally getting together once the dust had settled from the wreckage of both their marriages.***Both the book and movie are well done and thought provoking and worth reading and watching.  The DVD comes with no extras or commentary because apparently the people behind it ""wanted it that way""...which is pretty inexplicable since the movie was a critical success and hardly something that you'd want to blot out of existence.",4,Drama and Black Comedy in Suburbia,1249862400,"08 10, 2009",2009,6583,"['Little', 'Children', 'not', 'likely', 'movie', ""'m"", 'going', 'watch', 'again',

1052995,A1TJPMB7N776WS,B000N3SU92,MICHAEL ACUNA,"[99, 112]","""Little Children"" is a perfect movie: intelligently directed, lavishly produced, beautifully photographed, gloriously acted, intricately plotted and logically put together.Director Todd Field's first film, ""In the Bedroom"" (based on a story by Andre Dubus) was also effective, moving, and brutal: a kitchen sink drama about a murder, the families involved with that murder and the repercussions involved therein.In ""Little Children,"" Fields has ratcheted up the living circumstances to upstate, suburban Massachusetts:  plain jane, Sarah Pierce (Kate Winslet) unhappily married to a porno -obsessed, mostly absent husband, the drop dead gorgeous couple of Kathy and Brad Anderson (Patrick Wilson and for once not playing a victim, the luminous Jennifer Connolly) who have reached an impasse in their marriage as Kathy is it's sole provider and Brad is conflicted about taking the Law Bar exam for the third time. Thrown into this mix is a recently released from jail for exposing himself to a child, Ronald McGorvey (Jackie Earle Haley) and his loving, doting Mother (Phyllis Somerville).Sarah and Brad, both with their children, meet in a park one day: attraction is inevitable though neither is the other ones ""type."" That said, what they do fill for each other are those voids that tend to get bigger and deeper as we grow older, grow more disappointed with our lives and realize that our dreams will probably not come true. Fairy-tale romance this one? Hardly.  Fields is too much the realist, his psyche and artistic intuition too much about the realities of contemporary life to go that route and Winslet and Wilson give Sarah and Brad their all: vulnerable, romantic, crazy-in-lust even but again always looking over their shoulders for that ""thing"" that will break them up. Their sex scenes are filmed with this kind of tension and though they make love in private, they may as well be outdoors on  a busy street because, though they are definitely into it...both have one eye open...waiting for the door to open, waiting to be discovered, caught, unveiled.Though there is a lot of sex and violence here, there is really not much love except that between the ""sex criminal"" Ronald and his Mother. Ronald's Mom loves him without reservation though she is more than aware of his shortcomings. She even goes so far as to arrange a computer date for him as ""you need to meet a nice girl, Ronald."" What ensues is inevitable and funny/sad.Jennifer Connelly  plays Kathy as an icy-cold *itch, seemingly in control, career-minded, needing Brad to step up to the plate financially and professionally but at the same time needing him to be adrift, lost, emotionally wounded so that she can despise and pity him, be her whipping boy, her child yet her husband. In many ways, Kathy needs Brad to fail so that she can feel superior, to have a vessel into which she can pour her bile. When Connolly intuits the affair between Brad and Sarah at a dinner at her home, she does it with barely a nod of her head and a deep, burning flick of her beautiful eyes: you actually feel her eyes gouging a hole into you as you watch.""Little Children"" is about just that...but not the chronologically appropriate ones. It's about supposed adults who carry on without thinking like adults, without weighing or really caring about the consequences of their actions. And like Ang Lee's masterful ""Ice Storm,"" ""Little Children"" is psychically set in a place in which we must tread very carefully always aware that what he is saying here might just apply to our very own lives.",5,Save the Children,1160524800,"10 11, 2006",2006,3553,"['Little', 'Children', 'perfect', 'movie', 'intelligently', 'directed', 'lavishly', 'produced', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'gloriously', 'acted', 'intricately', 'plotted', 'logically', 'put', 'together.Director', 'Todd', 'Field', 'first', 'film', 'Bedroom', 'based', 'story', 'Andre', 'Dubus', 'was', 'also', 'effective', 'moving', 'brutal', 'kitchen', 'sink', 'drama', 'murder', 'families', 'involved', 'murder', 'repercussions', 'involved', 'therein.In', 'Little', 'Children', 'Fields', 'ratcheted', 'up', 'living', 'circumstances', 'upstate', 'suburban', 'Massachusetts', 'plain', 'jane', 'Sarah', 'Pierce', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'unhappily', 'married', 'porno', '-obsessed', 'mostly', 'absent', 'husband', 'drop', 'dead', 'gorgeous', 'couple', 'Kathy', 'Brad', 'Anderson', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'once', 'not', 'playing', 'victim', 'luminous', 'Jennifer', 'Connolly', 'who', 'have', 'reached', 'impasse', 'marriage', 'Kathy', 'sole', 'provider', 'Brad', 'conflicted', 'taking', 'Law', 'Bar', 'exam', 'third', 'time', 'Thrown', 'mix', 'recently', 'released', 'jail', 'exposing', 'child', 'Ronald', 'McGorvey', 'Jackie', 'Earle', 'Haley', 'loving', 'doting', 'Mother', 'Phyllis', 'Somerville', '.Sarah', 'Brad', 'children', 'meet', 'park', 'one', 'day', 'attraction', 'inevitable', 'other', 'ones', 'type', 'said', 'what', 'do', 'fill', 'other', 'are', 'voids', 'tend', 'get', 'bigger', 'deeper', 'grow', 'older', 'grow', 'more', 'disappointed', 'lives', 'realize', 'dreams', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'come', 'true', 'Fairy-tale', 'romance', 'one', 'Hardly', 'Fields', 'too', 'much', 'realist', 'psyche', 'artistic', 'intuition', 'too', 'much', 'realities', 'contemporary', 'life', 'go', 'route', 'Winslet', 'Wilson', 'give', 'Sarah', 'Brad', 'vulnerable', 'romantic', 'crazy-in-lust', 'even', 'again', 'always', 'looking', 'over', 'shoulders', 'thing', 'will', 'break', 'up', 'sex', 'scenes', 'are', 'filmed', 'kind', 'tension', 'make', 'love', 'private', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'outdoors', 'busy', 'street', 'are', 'definitely', 'have', 'one', 'eye', 'open', 'waiting', 'door', 'open', 'waiting', 'be', 'discovered', 'caught', 'lot', 'sex', 'violence', 'here', 'really', 'not', 'much', 'love', 'sex', 'criminal', 'Ronald', 'Mother', 'Ronald', 'Mom', 'reservation', 'more', 'aware', 'shortcomings', 'even', 'so', 'far', 'arrange', 'computer', 'date', 'need', 'meet', 'nice', 'girl', 'Ronald', 'What', 'inevitable', 'funny/sad.Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'Kathy', 'icy-cold', '*itch', 'seemingly', 'control', 'career-minded', 'needing', 'Brad', 'step', 'up', 'plate', 'financially', 'professionally', 'same', 'time', 'needing', 'be', 'adrift', 'lost', 'emotionally', 'wounded', 'so', 'can', 'despise', 'pity', 'be', 'whipping', 'boy', 'child', 'yet', 'husband', 'many', 'ways', 'Kathy', 'Brad', 'fail', 'so', 'can', 'feel', 'superior', 'have', 'vessel', 'can', 'pour', 'bile', 'When', 'Connolly', 'affair', 'Brad', 'Sarah', 'dinner', 'home', 'barely', 'nod', 'head', 'deep', 'burning', 'flick', 'beautiful', 'eyes', 'actually', 'feel', 'eyes', 'gouging', 'hole', 'watch', 'Little', 'Children', 'about', 'just', 'not', 'chronologically', 'appropriate', 'ones', 'supposed', 'adults', 'who', 'carry', 'thinking', 'adults', 'weighing', 'really', 'caring', 'consequences', 'actions', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'masterful', 'Ice', 'Storm', 'Little', 'Children', 'psychically', 'set', 'place', 'must', 'tread', 'very', 'carefully', 'always', 'aware', 'what', 'saying', 'here', 'might', 'just', 'apply', 'very', 'own', 'lives']",N/A

This is not a spare, dry or slow film. The tension between the unhappy couples and the rage the fired vigilante cop has for the resident pedophile keep the suspense going.

1053003,A3TSPLFYU2UMW0,B000N3SU92,nicjaytee,"[1, 2]","There's something very odd about ""Little Children"": it grabs your attention, the acting's good (in the case of Kate Winslet & Jackie Earle Haley, both nominated for Oscars as a result of their performances, superb), the story's intriguing, and what happens to the characters is at times quite thought-provoking, but there's something eerie and very uncomfortable about it all that's difficult to put your finger on... until you think about what you've seen.Which is? Well, when you reflect on it, none of the people are actually believable and much of what happens to them is also pretty unbelievable. So much so, that it's as though the town's been populated by zombies who conduct their lives in an extremely detached, often bizarrely odd way. For example, a married man and a married woman lie together around the town's packed public swimming pool, day after day, and nobody notices or draws conclusions? A man on his way to elope with his lover gets waylaid during possibly the greatest decision in his life into trying a bit of highly dangerous skateboarding with a group of teenagers? A woman plays with her small daughter in a lonely park at night when there's a known paedophile operating in the area? Come on...Certainly, as a ""moving"" love story or a critique of small town America it fails because the characters and events involved are just not believable enough. But that's not what makes it such uncomfortable viewing. No, what makes it so is its really quite nasty sub-story of paedophilia - not a subject that sits comfortably in any film and one that's actually handled very badly here. A known paedophile visits the children's local swimming pool in full snorkelling gear without anyone noticing that there's something blatantly odd going on until he's been in the water for some time? An ex-policeman ruthlessly and publicly persecutes this paedophile to the point of self-castration and then atones for his actions by ""lovingly"" carrying him to hospital? These aren't only equally unbelievable events but actually quite unacceptable viewing particularly when, like several other similarly bizarre or over-the-top scenes in the film, they seem to be in there primarily for dramatic or comic effect.Excellent acting and clever direction make ""Little Children"" worth seeing but it's implausible and at times very unpleasant storyline coupled with its woeful lack of characterisation end up making it something you want to go through twice.

1053004,A1129LM24YWSZV,B000N3SU92,"Nicole Bradshaw ""Nicole Bradshaw""","[2, 2]","Yikes. Though well-done, Little Children is a very difficult movie to watch.Sarah (Winslet) is a stay-at-home mom in a small, suburban community. Her only child, daughter Lucy, is three, and Sarah apparently has no plans to return to the work force. Though her family could well afford it, Sarah does not put Lucy in any part-time childcare, and she shuns opportunities to spend time with other SAHMs. (I can only guess that she feels ""above"" them?) However, she seems to resent her duties as a full-time mom. In fact, it doesn't appear that she enjoys spending time with her daughter at all, even though that's primarily what she does. As a result, Sarah feels unfulfilled.Brad (Wilson) is a stay-at-home dad with a young son and a knockout wife (Connelly) who works in the documentary film industry. He's graduated from law school but, thus far, has failed to pass the bar exam. Money is tight at Brad's household, and his wife routinely questions his expenditures - magazine subscriptions, his desire for a cell phone, etc. Because his wife allows his son to sleep in their bed, sex is at an all-time low for Brad. As a result of all the above, Brad feels unfulfilled.When Sarah and Brad meet at the park one day, an unexplainable kiss sets them on track to potentially life-altering events. In addition, tightly-wound subplots - a sex offender moving into the neighborhood, a local cop who's now ""retired"" due to his use of deadly force on the job, etc. - add to the ominous feeling that everything could very well fall apart by the end of the film.Performances were very strong throughout. There was not a character in this film that I did not believe. Everyone turned in A work here; cannot write enough good things about that. In my opinion, the performances are what make this film so compelling.However, I had difficulty watching Little Children, which I suppose was partly the point. First of all, I didn't understand WHY the characters made some of the choices they did. Sarah and Brad's first encounter was completely baffling to me. They hardly know one another, and they kiss. Wha . . . ? And since this is the initial event that sets all of the others in motion, I kinda wanted more motivation for the characters here.Other ""whys"" - why doesn't Sarah talk with her own husband regarding the distance they are experiencing and her need for fulfillment; why doesn't Brad assert himself more in his own marriage, rather than surrendering his whole self to being a SAHD? They are both kind-of weak personalities.The subplots were not easy, either. The sex offender is being harassed by the ""retired"" cop. The offender's mother (who he's moved back in with) is trying her best to protect her son and help him reform.

1053006,A10X0JN8KTK89H,B000N3SU92,ninjasuperstar,"[0, 0]","Little Children is the darkest tragicomedy I have seen.  It puts a pin through the bellies of the audience members, fixes us against our theater seats, and watches US wriggle.  This movie outlines suburban fantasies and fears: sexual frustration and sexual predators, parenting vs. careerism, reading groups and power walking.  Little Children also suggests the irony of suburban life: People move to the suburbs to escape the sin and crime of the city, but the safe, uneventful suburb is painfully dull and monotonous; what seems a sanctuary becomes a prison.  When people get bored, the desire for adventure and a renewed sense of life overpowers rational thought.  Great risks are taken, indeed.Further, the film explores what happens when a criminal element (supposedly reformed and rehabilitated) is introduced into a suburban paradise.  Those who feel that their ""perfect"" life is being threatened from the outside look for some rather crazy ways to preserve what's inside.  In the end, both the bored and the overprotective are equally reckless and irresponsible.The comedy of the film is that people think they can keep a utopian society eternally blissful and unalterably intact.  The tragedy of the film is that things go wrong when selfish conservation of an idea overrides common sense.Almost every character is developed so that the audience either sympathizes or empathizes with them.  I couldn't care much about Sarah's (played by Kate Winslet) husband, Richard (played by Gregg Edelman).  I think there's a reason why his name is ""Richard.""  The cast is great all around, even the child actors.The movie becomes self-interpretive in one overly contrived scene.  Sarah is at the neighborhood reading group, and the novel being discussed is Madame Bovary.  Being a student of English literature, Sarah is familiar with the novel and has a critical understanding of the text.  Due to her personal circumstances, she tosses that understanding aside in favor of a different reading of the book, one that is based on life experience instead of scholarly theory.  I have no opinion about which interpretation is more convincing, but I think these kinds of narrative moves in films are too coincidental to be real.  I feel like I'm taken out of the movie at those moments, and my suspension of disbelief is damaged.Director Todd Field was also behind the camera of In the Bedroom.  I didn't know this going into the film.  Twenty minutes into the movie, I leaned over to my girlfriend and said, ""This has the same tone as In the Bedroom.""  And it does.  Field has a voyeuristic style that makes everyone and everything in the film - even playground equipment - appear naked.  Because the film is largely about hidden desires, a voyeuristic director is certainly an excellent choice.  But Little Children is dark comedy whereas In the Bedroom is just dark.I describe the film as ""tragicomedy"" because it successfully blends elements of both.  American Beauty is also a tragicomedy, but the ending of that film is not as disturbing as the ending of Little Children.  For something to be tragic, the audience must sympathize or empathize with the main characters.  For something to be comedic, the audience must feel superior to the characters or character types.  Little Children is able to do both simultaneously, and whether one feels that the film is a dark comedy, tragedy, or tragicomedy says more about the viewer than the film.  Since I consider the film a tragicomedy, I suppose that means I believe that there's no true order to the world: chaos, hostility, and self-centeredness reign over all, and we only think of our children when their absence harms us.

I rented this movie because she was in it. With all that said, we, my wife and I, gave up after 42 minutes. Her performance *was* excellent, but it couldn't overshadow the director's trudging portrayal of the obnoxious and darker side of human nature.This movie just did absolutely nothing through 40 minutes except set the stage for an obvious upcoming affair between Winslet and her male interest. Whatever else follows--who cares? The characters have so few redeeming qualities, the only reason to see the film was to study the talent of the performers; and that wasn't enough reason for us. While I'm *sure* there are lots of folks out there who behave and think as portrayed by these drones, there's no reason to study them. The ""Frontline"" narrative did absolutely nothing; someone said it was a ploy of genius, enabling the filmmaker to detach the viewer from sloppy emotional portrayals. We only felt that the narrative was redundant; its' monotone may have quelled emotion for some, but for us, all it did was add an element of extraneous background chatter.

My favorite part of the movie is Sarah and Brad's sexual relationship.  This is perhaps one of the best, most nuanced explorations of lust and desire ever presented on film.  Field's problem is that he's drawn to high drama, when his true talent obviously lies in capturing the subtle power of small things and events.  By adding unnecessary complications and stakes to the plot, he cheapens his films.  Also someone needs to tell serious Hollywood filmmakers that having multiple storylines in your film doesn't automatically make it great.  In the case of ""Little Children"", the characters would be better served to be in two different movies - one dealing with Sarah and Brad's relationship and the other with Ronnie the sex offender.

1053014,A2FUOXFJ74B32M,B000N3SU92,"P.K. Ryan ""The Ryan Identity""","[7, 7]","This was an odd little movie. It is yet another film in the vein of 'American Beauty' that purports to portray American suburbia as a twisted, repressed, and phony place. The main protaganists are Winslet and Wilson who are both repressed, unfulfilled, stay at home suburban parents. They meet at the playground and take up a love affair. They seem to revel in their shared secret rebellion against their respective spouses, as well as the petty, superficial people that surround them. There is also the neighborhood pedophile who is constantly feared and harassed by the townsfolk, and his disturbing life is examined. I suppose the moral of the story was that these adults are really the little children who use their discontentment and self-righteousness to justify their childish and selfish behavior.I think the film made some relevant points, but unfortunately, like it's predecessor 'American Beauty' it was more of a caricature, than a true to life representation. While of course there is a grain of truth to every stereotype, I think the generalizations were a bit over the top. Perhaps I'm jumping the gun by assuming that the filmmakers meant this as an indictment of suburbia, but the tone of the 5 star reviews suggest just that. There seems to be an almost joyful glee in some of the reviews at exposing those twisted surburbanites as the shallow, repressed, phonies that they apparently are. I guess these enlightened urban denizens would have us believe that only in suburbia is there repressed, isolated, or hypocritical people. Give me a break! Honestly, I thought it was a bit too preachy and touchy-feely for my taste also. Yes, the disturbed pedophile is a sad case, but I thought the film was a bit too sympathetic to him. Anyways, the film did manage to hold my attention and intrigue me so it wasn't a total loss. Of course the sex scenes helped in this regard....",3,Strange Little Children,1203292800,"02 18, 2008",2008,1889,"['was', 'odd', 'little', 'movie', 'yet', 'film', 'vein', ""'American"", 'Beauty', 'portray', 'American', 'suburbia', 'twisted', 'repressed', 'phony', 'place', 'main', 'protaganists', 'are', 'Winslet', 'Wilson', 'who', 'are', 'repressed', 'unfulfilled', 'stay', 'home', 'suburban', 'parents', 'meet', 'playground', 'take', 'up', 'love', 'affair', 'seem', 'revel', 'shared', 'secret', 'rebellion', 'respective', 'spouses', 'as', 'well', 'petty', 'superficial', 'people', 'surround', 'also', 'neighborhood', 'pedophile', 'who', 'constantly', 'feared', 'harassed', 'townsfolk', 'disturbing', 'life', 'examined', 'suppose', 'moral', 'story', 'was', 'adults', 'are', 'really', 'little', 'children', 'who', 'use', 'discontentment', 'self-righteousness', 'justify', 'childish', 'selfish', 'behavior.I', 'think', 'film', 'made', 'relevant', 'points', 'unfortunately', 'predecessor', ""'American"", 'Beauty', 'was', 'more', 'caricature', 'true', 'life', 'representation', 'course', 'grain', 'truth', 'stereotype', 'think', 'generalizations', 'were', 'bit', 'top', 'Perhaps', ""'m"", 'jumping', 'gun', 'assuming', 'filmmakers', 'meant', 'indictment', 'suburbia', 'tone', '5', 'star', 'reviews', 'suggest', 'just', 'be', 'almost', 'joyful', 'glee', 'reviews', 'exposing', 'twisted', 'surburbanites', 'shallow', 'repressed', 'phonies', 'apparently', 'are', 'guess', 'enlightened', 'urban', 'denizens', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'only', 'suburbia', 'there', 'repressed', 'isolated', 'hypocritical', 'people', 'Give', 'break', 'Honestly', 'thought', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'preachy', 'touchy-feely', 'taste', 'also', 'Yes', 'disturbed', 'pedophile', 'sad', 'case', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'sympathetic', 'Anyways', 'film', 'did', 'manage', 'hold', 'attention', 'intrigue', 'was', ""n't"", 'total', 'loss', 'course', 'sex', 'scenes', 'helped', 'regard']",N/A

McGrath ""prmcgr""","[3, 5]","Todd Fields's foray into the great vacuous expanse of (Hollywood's view of) American suburbia is noteworthy for its shear hilarity.Like 'American Beauty,' 'Happiness' and 'Your Friends and Neighbors' before it, this film explores lives of quiet desperation which supposedly unfold just over the hedge, in the your neighbor's home, if not closer.  Of course, most of this stuff is shear rubbish.  Hollywood never has much positive to say about the suburbs, and certainly never offers insight - whatsoever - into the spiritual habits of America's Great Middle Class (i.e. most Americans are not the materialistic, hedonistic, morally vacant poltroons depicted in this film, but are in fact earnest, God fearing citizens seeking not the ""good life"", but to live good lives).Regardless, this film is worth a look.  Like watching a four car pile up on the side of the highway, one can't easily pull away from 'Little Children' as it unfolds.  As others have noted, Winslet's performance is earthy and real.  The humanity of her performance underpins the entire production.  Without her, 'Little Children' would have been an empty exercise in dreary cynicism.  With her, the film largely succeeds.The narration gave this film a documentary feel, as if one were witnessing the tribal habits of some strange foreign society.  In fact, what the film does depict is a fantasy society (Hollywood's view of what suburbia is ""really like"") but it is an alternately affecting, then uproarious, fantasy, full of carefully paced subplots, creative cinematography, and interesting dialogue.And, thank you, Mr. Fields, for not presenting us with the usual Hollywood gore-fest ending (well, just a smidgeon of gore).  That Winslet's character actually came to her senses at the end of this film was a genuine surpise (though why she would return to her ridiculous husband is a mystery).Overall, this film is definitely worth a look and may have the potential, perhaps, to someday become a classic of American cinema.",4,Hilarious & Heartrending,1180915200,"06 4, 2007",2007,1997,"['Todd', 'Fields', 'foray', 'great', 'vacuous', 'expanse', 'Hollywood', 'view', 'American', 'suburbia', 'noteworthy', 'shear', 'hilarity.Like', ""'American"", 'Beauty', ""'Your"", 'Friends', 'Neighbors', 'film', 'lives', 'quiet', 'desperation', 'supposedly', 'unfold', 'just', 'hedge', 'neighbor', 'home', 'not', 'closer', 'course', 'most', 'stuff', 'shear', 'rubbish', 'Hollywood', 'never', 'much', 'positive', 'say', 'suburbs', 'certainly', 'never', 'insight', 'whatsoever', 'spiritual', 'habits', 'America', 'Great', 'Middle', 'Class', 'i.e', 'most', 'Americans', 'are', 'not', 'materialistic', 'hedonistic', 'morally', 'vacant', 'poltroons', 'depicted', 'film', 'are', 'fact', 'earnest', 'God', 'fearing', 'citizens', 'seeking', 'not', 'good', 'life', 'live', 'good', 'lives', '.Regardless', 'film', 'look', 'watching', 'four', 'car', 'pile', 'up', 'side', 'highway', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'easily', 'pull', 'away', ""'Little"", 'Children', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'Winslet', 'performance', 'earthy', 'real', 'humanity', 'performance', 'entire', 'production', 'Children', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'empty', 'exercise', 'dreary', 'cynicism', 'film', 'largely', 'succeeds.The', 'narration', 'gave', 'film', 'documentary', 'feel', 'one', 'were', 'witnessing', 'tribal', 'habits', 'strange', 'foreign', 'society', 'fact', 'what', 'film', 'depict', 'fantasy', 'society', 'Hollywood', 'view', 'what', 'suburbia', 'really', 'alternately', 'affecting', 'then', 'uproarious', 'fantasy', 'full', 'carefully', 'paced', 'subplots', 'creative', 'cinematography', 'interesting', 'dialogue.And', 'thank', 'Mr.', 'Fields', 'not', 'presenting', 'usual', 'Hollywood', 'gore-fest', 'ending', 'well', 'just', 'smidgeon', 'gore', 'Winslet', 'character', 'actually', 'came', 'senses', 'end', 'film', 'was', 'genuine', 'surpise', 'why', 'would', 'return', 'ridiculous', 'husband', 'mystery', '.Overall', 'film', 'definitely', 'worth', 'look', 'may', 'have', 'potential', 'perhaps', 'someday', 'become', 'classic', 'American', 'cinema']",N/A

What is seen is a barrage of clich&eacute;s disguised by a different eggshell. Dissatisfied middle-class suburbanites looking for a way out of their self-imposed cage. The only ways out are to regress to primitive instincts, as wanting to be a skateboard-riding teenager or simply reinventing primordial lust. Now, the reasoning behind it I guess is still formulaic. Fetishism on the one hand (collecting odd items from some internet diva) and the hardened domineering wife-boss figure, symbolically castrating the jobless man of the house, ""reduced"" to a social mockery of the stay-at-home parent. The anti-hero, Mr Exhibitionist, is perhaps the one who needs to be focused on as the most human of all. Touted as a pedophile in the subtext (even though this is insanely untrue), he displays the utmost need to be seen in his ordinarily repressed sexuality.. this is why exhibitionists do what they do, they need their sexual organs to be noticed, and their is unbearable anxiety and distress if their impulses are not obeyed. The regression also extends to his oedipal ties with mommy. Now, everybody goes through conflict, and all is magically resolved. The killing of 2 birds with one stone comes with the washed-up ex-cop who killed a kid... in matters of pure instinctual survival drive, he manages to display reaction formation (loathing of the sexual offender when, deep down inside, perhaps he identified with him or had the wish to save him) as well as a fairy-tale chance to save the child-figure he murdered in the past (hence ""atoning"" his past errors), after the man cuts his own penis off, in a fantastic demonstration of a partial object coming to life and dying by a symbolic (and literal) detachment from the conflicted psyche. Of note, it is of a more pedophilic nature to lust after the childhood universe (even if it's in a veiled and nonsexual way), as the skateboarding scenario would suggest... it's called romantic pedophilia, and may certainly convert to a sexual kind... but these hypotheses are useless.. after all, all conflict needn't be faced head-on to simply disappear. But, of course, as American culture has time and again jammed down everyone's throat, nobody needs to have any deep realization about the root of their problems nor gain even the slightest insight, it's all a matter of some intangible force tapping them on their limbic system, and the self-contained story comes to a close with the happy ending preceding the closing credits, allowing us to believe nothing negative will derive from subsequent events.",3,Paraphilia NOS,1260489600,"12 11, 2009",2009,2683,"['Yippeee', 'wanted', 'watch', 'film', 'reading', 'positive', 'reviews', 'galore', 'addition', 'controversial', 'subject', 'matter', 'What', 'seen', 'barrage', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'disguised', 'different', 'eggshell', 'Dissatisfied', 'middle-class', 'suburbanites', 'looking', 'way', 'self-imposed', 'cage', 'only', 'ways', 'out', 'are', 'regress', 'primitive', 'instincts', 'wanting', 'be', 'skateboard-riding', 'teenager', 'simply', 'reinventing', 'primordial', 'lust', 'Now', 'reasoning', 'guess', 'still', 'formulaic', 'Fetishism', 'one', 'hand', 'collecting', 'odd', 'items', 'internet', 'diva', 'hardened', 'domineering', 'wife-boss', 'figure', 'symbolically', 'castrating', 'jobless', 'man', 'house', 'reduced', 'social', 'mockery', 'stay-at-home', 'parent', 'anti-hero', 'Mr', 'Exhibitionist', 'perhaps', 'one', 'who', 'be', 'focused', 'most', 'human', 'Touted', 'pedophile', 'subtext', 'even', 'insanely', 'untrue', 'utmost', 'need', 'be', 'seen', 'ordinarily', 'repressed', 'sexuality..', 'why', 'exhibitionists', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'need', 'sexual', 'organs', 'be', 'noticed', 'unbearable', 'anxiety', 'distress', 'impulses', 'are', 'not', 'obeyed', 'regression', 'also', 'oedipal', 'ties', 'mommy', 'Now', 'everybody', 'conflict', 'magically', 'resolved', 'killing', '2', 'birds', 'one', 'stone', 'washed-up', 'ex-cop', 'who', 'killed', 'kid', 'matters', 'pure', 'instinctual', 'survival', 'drive', 'display', 'reaction', 'formation', 'loathing', 'sexual', 'offender', 'when', 'deep', 'down', 'inside', 'perhaps', 'identified', 'had', 'wish', 'save', 'as', 'well', 'fairy-tale', 'chance', 'save', 'child-figure', 'murdered', 'past', 'hence', 'atoning', 'past', 'errors', 'man', 'own', 'penis', 'fantastic', 'demonstration', 'partial', 'object', 'coming', 'life', 'dying', 'symbolic', 'literal', 'detachment', 'conflicted', 'psyche', 'note', 'more', 'pedophilic', 'nature', 'lust', 'childhood', 'universe', 'even', 'veiled', 'nonsexual', 'way', 'skateboarding', 'scenario', 'would', 'suggest', 'called', 'romantic', 'pedophilia', 'may', 'certainly', 'convert', 'sexual', 'kind', 'hypotheses', 'are', 'useless..', 'conflict', 'need', ""n't"", 'be', 'faced', 'head-on', 'simply', 'disappear', 'course', 'American', 'culture', 'time', 'again', 'jammed', 'everyone', 'throat', 'nobody', 'needs', 'have', 'deep', 'realization', 'root', 'problems', 'gain', 'even', 'slightest', 'insight', 'matter', 'intangible', 'force', 'tapping', 'limbic', 'system', 'self-contained', 'story', 'close', 'happy', 'ending', 'preceding', 'closing', 'credits', 'allowing', 'believe', 'nothing', 'negative', 'will', 'derive', 'subsequent', 'events']",N/A

1053020,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B000N3SU92,RMurray847,"[3, 3]","One of the greatest things about LITTLE CHILDREN is the way it beautifully captures the feel of the novel upon which it is based.  Yes, the author co-wrote the screenplay...but more than that...the film leaves certain items out of the book (to save time) and changes some plot points...but the overall flavor is wonderfully captured.But the absolute greatest thing are the performances of the two Oscar nominees...Kate Winslet and Jackie-Earle Haley.  Winslet plays a very easy to dislike unhappy suburban mom.  But she's not the ""typical"" mom who takes care of the children, develops play dates, keeps the house perfect, watches and follows Martha Stewart, etc.  We see those kinds of women in her circle of acquaintances...but Winslet is more.  She feels somehow that she is disconnected from these women because she has not connected or accepted that she is now an adult.  She scorns the women...and they are pretty worthy of some derision.  But she also fails to turn her discernment on herself.  She has even failed to connect emotionally with her daughter...they are a tandem that MUST be together...but neither would choose to spend time with the other if it could be avoided.  Into Winslet's boring life comes hunky, stay-at-home Dad Patrick Wilson...and he's even more trapped in his arrested development.  He's supposed to be studying for the bar exam each evening...but he's given up on that.  He'd rather watch youthful skateboarders outside the library or pay full-contact football.  He resents the fact that his wife is the ""breadwinner"" and that his wife reserves all her true affection for their young son.So naturally, these two ""Little Children"" are drawn together.  Their relationship is the crux of the story...and Winslet charts her character's path beautifully.  The script helps, as does some droll narration...but all you really need to know about her is etched right on her face.  At one point, she catches her older husband engaged in a private and distasteful act. On her face we see the surprise, then the revulsion, then a moment of amusement, and then the realization that he's just given her an excuse to stop pretending they have a healthy relationship.  This happens in about 10 seconds...and it's as clear as though she had expressed those thoughts out loud.  Late in the film, Winslet has an emotional moment with her little girl, and we see her character literally switching from being one type of person to another.  She is startlingly good, as always, with an impeccable American accent.Into this suburban mix, we have Jackie Earle Haley as a recently released child sexual offender, who has moved in with his mom.  An angry ex-cop (Noah Emmerich) has made it his mission to drive this guy away, to warn the neighbors and to basically take out his inchoate anger and loathing at himself on someone else.  Haley IS a despicable character...yet again the writing and the performance make us see that he's just as filled with loathing at himself as we are by his acts and desires.  Haley is amazing...he absolutely looks the part and he fills it so well.  His eyes, in particular, are amazing.  I love Alan Arkin  and was SO glad when he won the Oscar for LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE...but just comparing one performance to another (rather than one body of work to another), Haley should have won the Oscar hands down.  It's a fearless performance, nuanced and a little terrifying.Emmerich is very good as the tortured ex-cop.  His seemingly genial nature is just shot through with anger.  You can palpably feel how helpless he feels about his fate and his lot in life.  Patrick Wilson (who was so enjoyable last year in HARD CANDY) looks his part, and is pretty good...but he's just left eating the dust of Winslet a bit.  Jennifer Connelly, as Wilson's wife, has a small part, and she brings her usual quiet sensitivity to it.  As she has aged, and as she's spent a few years married to British actor Paul Bettany, her voice has taken on just a small tinge of ""superiority"" in its tone.  When I see her on talk shows and such...it comes across as a little annoying...just like Madonna's ever deepening English accent makes her seem SO phony.  But in this film, it's perfect.Director and co-writer Todd Fields (who also served these same duties for the beautiful, heartbreaking IN THE BEDROOM) is now undeniably a master at literary adaptation.  He takes important modern American writings, and turns them into minor-masterpieces of tone.  LITTLE CHILDREN is a film that should be seen by adult audiences...but is certainly  SHOULD be seen.  There are some brief but graphic moments of sexuality, a little harsh language, and a couple of scenes involving Haley that adults would NOT want to explain to their kids.For me, the primary lesson from the film is the potential we have to damage our children with our own childish ""adult"" behavior.  Winslet, in particular, seems oblivious to how she's affecting her little girl.  There's a heartbreaking scene when Winslet comes back from a couple of days away from her family, and immediately runs to the shower. Her little girl tries to talk with her and share the craft project she has made...but she is rebuffed and leaves...deeply hurt.  The movie argues that we adults need to ""grow up.""  We can't stay Little Children forever without causing harm.",5,Beautifully acted and written.,1178928000,"05 12, 2007",2007,5327,"['One', 'greatest', 'things', 'about', 'LITTLE', 'CHILDREN', 'way',

1053021,AA2F2KW85SEE1,B000N3SU92,Robert B,"[0, 5]","Little Children is the latest example of movies that demonize men. The overall theme of the movie is castration, symbolically and literally.Parallel stories which later merge are developed involving the various characters.Much discussion among some suburban housewives is about castrating a sexual offender who has exposed himself to a child, has served his time and is released back into the community. He looks like what he is - the cartoon-like cliche classic pervert.The man is released into the custody of his aging mother, who dotes on him as though he were a child, and which attention is probably what drove him to commit his offence in the first place, because emotionally he has never progressed beyond childhood and imagines himself and the objects of his affection as playmates. Even the date that he's forced into by his mother is a train-wreck - he can't stop looking at kids, and he ends up disgusting his date by his gross behaviour. This man visits the local swimming pool on a busy summer day, and the characterization of him as the monster in the pool, rather like the shark in 'Jaws', and the subsequent clearing of the pool by the panic-stricken parents, is a masterpiece of dark humour.The second set of characters is the briefcase totin' successful hard working wife and her stay-at-home emasculated child-like husband who pretends to be studying for his bar exams but really doesn't want to. He has to be constantly prodded to study, as someone would prod a child to do his homework. He later meets and forms a buddy relationship with an ex-cop who introduces him to a pick-up weekly football game that allows him to re-assert his long-lost masculinity. This husband is the object of interest of the previously mentioned local housewives in his visits to a local park, where he takes his little boy for his daily outing, and one of the housewives accepts a dare to talk to him and get his phone number. The two continue to meet in the park while ostensibly taking their children on their daily outing. A humorous scene takes place when the daughter of the mother wants to go to the bathroom; the mother tells her to just 'pee in the pool', but the child insists on going to the bathroom, thereby demonstrating that this young child is more socially mature than her mother. Eventually, a child-like extra-marital romance develops between the man and the woman, and an affair follows. Later, they agree to 'run away from home'.The woman who is the object of the husband's affection is married to a hard-working marketing guy who seems to be hooked on an internet porn site to the degree that he doesn't seem to have any time for his wife - he's so involved in his on-line peep-show relationship. This provides the motivation for the wife to seek companionship elsewhere, after she discovers him in a rather embarrassing situation while he is exploring his on-line relationship to the fullest extent possible.The final major character is the ex-cop who becomes totally obsessed with the perv who has been released into the community. The reason he's an ex-cop is because he over-reacted and unneccessarily killed an unarmed young man in the line of duty. This ex-cop is another cartoon characterization of a red-neck, brutish, vulgar, gun-toting suburbanite tough guy that we all love to hate, especially because he's probably just the way all men would be if they haven't been emasculated. He's the schoolyard bully grown up.In the end, there's tragedy, the ex-cop makes peace with the perv, everone grows up a little, and life goes on.Four stars just because it's so absorbing.",4,Man-hater's delight,1282953600,"08 28, 2010",2010,3600,"['Little', 'Children', 'latest', 'example', 'movies', 'demonize', 'men', 'overall', 'theme', 'movie', 'castration', 'symbolically', 'literally.Parallel', 'stories', 'later', 'merge', 'are', 'developed', 'involving', 'various', 'characters.Much', 'discussion', 'suburban', 'housewives', 'castrating', 'sexual', 'offender', 'who', 'exposed', 'child', 'served', 'time', 'released', 'back', 'community', 'what', 'cartoon-like', 'cliche', 'classic', 'pervert.The', 'man', 'released', 'custody', 'aging', 'mother', 'who', 'were', 'child', 'attention', 'probably', 'what', 'drove', 'commit', 'offence', 'first', 'place', 'emotionally', 'never', 'progressed', 'childhood', 'imagines', 'objects', 'affection', 'playmates', 'Even', 'date', 'forced', 'mother', 'train-wreck', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'looking', 'kids', 'up', 'disgusting', 'date', 'gross', 'behaviour', 'man', 'local', 'swimming', 'pool', 'busy', 'summer', 'day', 'characterization', 'monster', 'pool', 'rather', 'shark', ""'Jaws"", 'subsequent', 'clearing', 'pool', 'panic-stricken', 'parents', 'masterpiece', 'dark', 'humour.The', 'second', 'set', 'characters', 'briefcase', 'totin', 'successful', 'hard', 'working', 'wife', 'stay-at-home', 'emasculated', 'child-like', 'husband', 'who', 'be', 'studying', 'bar', 'exams', 'really', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'constantly', 'prodded', 'study', 'someone', 'would', 'prod', 'child', 'do', 'homework', 'later', 'meets', 'buddy', 'relationship', 'ex-cop', 'who', 'pick-up', 'weekly', 'football', 'game', 're-assert', 'long-lost', 'masculinity', 'husband', 'object', 'interest', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'local', 'housewives', 'visits', 'local', 'park', 'where', 'little', 'boy', 'daily', 'outing', 'one', 'housewives', 'accepts', 'dare', 'talk', 'get', 'phone', 'number', 'two', 'continue', 'meet', 'park', 'ostensibly', 'taking', 'children', 'daily', 'outing', 'humorous', 'scene', 'place', 'when', 'daughter', 'mother', 'go', 'bathroom', 'mother', 'just', ""'pee"", 'pool', 'child', 'going', 'bathroom', 'thereby', 'demonstrating', 'young', 'child', 'more', 'socially', 'mature', 'mother', 'Eventually', 'child-like', 'extra-marital', 'romance', 'man', 'woman', 'affair', 'Later', 'agree', ""'run"", 'away', ""home'.The"", 'woman', 'who', 'object', 'husband', 'affection', 'married', 'hard-working', 'marketing', 'guy', 'who', 'be', 'hooked', 'internet', 'porn', 'site', 'degree', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'time', 'wife', 'so', 'involved', 'on-line', 'peep-show', 'relationship', 'motivation', 'wife', 'seek', 'companionship', 'elsewhere', 'rather', 'embarrassing', 'situation', 'exploring', 'on-line', 'relationship', 'fullest', 'extent', 'possible.The', 'final', 'major', 'character', 'ex-cop', 'who', 'totally', 'obsessed', 'perv', 'who', 'been', 'released', 'community', 'reason', 'ex-cop', 'over-reacted', 'unneccessarily', 'killed', 'unarmed', 'young', 'man', 'line', 'duty', 'ex-cop', 'cartoon', 'characterization', 'red-neck', 'brutish', 'vulgar', 'gun-toting', 'suburbanite', 'tough', 'guy', 'love', 'hate', 'especially', 'probably', 'just', 'way', 'men', 'would', 'be', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'emasculated', 'schoolyard', 'bully', 'grown', 'end', 'tragedy', 'ex-cop', 'peace', 'perv', 'everone', 'up', 'little', 'life', 'on.Four', 'stars', 'just', 'so', 'absorbing']",N/A

Martel""","[1, 1]","All I kept hearing about this film was that is was about a child molester and that it asked the audience to sympathize with this twisted character.  Needless to say, this film made many people very angry.  However a few critics I trust said the movie was worth seeing and that there was much more to it than following a pervert around.In fact while Ronnie (played excellently by Jackie Earle Haley) is a key character he is not the main character.  Instead we follow the lives of Sarah (played by the always wonderful Kate Winslet) and Brad (Patrick Wilson).  Sarah is a woman who's life is not what she wanted.  She despises her husband and can't relate to her 5 year old daughter.  On the flip side Brad lives with a woman who controls his life and a 5 year old son who may or may not be mocking him by wearing a jester hat everywhere.  Sarah and Brad meet and quickly find a powerful connection.Things go from friendly to very friendly to intimate.  This makes life in their suburb very complicated.  Either one of them seems willing and wanting to make a change, but just how far can they go.The script is written very well, weaving this main story with a couple of other sub stories (including Ronnie dealing with life out of prison).  Each follows a similar theme and touches the other.  As a whole it works, because of solid acting, great dialogue, excellent use of narration (something that can usually sink a movie but works great in this case) and top notch camera work.  The score supports the whole film.The movie isn't necessarily entertaining.  It makes you think, and especially if you are watching it with a spouse, want to talk about many of the difficult themes it presents. It's not perfect, the number of plots seems to make the film more dense than it needs to be and reduces the effectiveness of the overall film (I imagine this works better in the novel).  The ending also seems to lose a bit of the bite the rest of the movie had.  It felt like the movie was trying to be like ""American Beauty"" but instead of delivering something a challenging at the end, it goes for something a little to easy.

In the past, I have also enjoyed movies that focus on social commentary. So this film, that shows the lives of a group of individuals living in suburbia, that counts with a great cast, and that was nominated for three academy awards, looked like a dream come true. Sadly, this production is so tedious that it almost put me to sleep.Sarah (Kate Winslet) is a mother, a not very good one if I might add, and the wife of a boring pornography-loving executive. She has started going to the park with her daughter and a few other women with kids, and one day she meets Brad (Patrick Wilson). He is referred to by the other mothers as the prom king, and goes to the park with his harlequin-hat-loving son. Brad is married to a gorgeous filmmaker and is struggling with his career choice. He is supposed to be studying for the bar exam, for the third time, but he does not have the drive to do it. Instead of going to the library and study he goes to watch the skaters have fun and dreams of joining them.When the dissatisfied Sarah and Brad meet, there is an instant connection, which slowly develops into an affair. The pace is slow and uninteresting, and the constant narration using voice-over gets old pretty quickly. There are some added elements that bring some complexity to the mix, like a pervert living in the neighborhood and having everyone on edge, and a cop that has issues dealing with his past and present. But that's it, there is not much more to this movie.The main problem I have with this film is that the flow of the story was not able to catch my attention, and therefore, the few plusses, like the acting, were lost in a morass of boredom. I was extremely disappointed, since this was highly recommended by several of my friends. I may be in the minority for disliking this one, but in my opinion, there is not much to like.",2,"""You are nervous, aren't you?""",1187827200,"08 23, 2007",2007,1941,"['people', 'have', 'criticized', 'liking', 'long', 'slow', 'moving', 'movies', 'such', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'past', 'have', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'movies', 'focus', 'social', 'commentary', 'film', 'lives', 'group', 'individuals', 'living', 'suburbia', 'great', 'cast', 'was', 'nominated', 'three', 'academy', 'awards', 'looked', 'dream', 'come', 'true', 'Sadly', 'production', 'so', 'tedious', 'almost', 'put', 'sleep.Sarah', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'mother', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'might', 'add', 'wife', 'boring', 'pornography-loving', 'executive', 'started', 'going', 'park', 'daughter', 'few', 'other', 'women', 'kids', 'one', 'day', 'Brad', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'referred', 'other', 'mothers', 'prom', 'king', 'park', 'harlequin-hat-loving', 'son', 'Brad', 'married', 'gorgeous', 'filmmaker', 'struggling', 'career', 'choice', 'supposed', 'be', 'studying', 'bar', 'exam', 'third', 'time', 'not', 'have', 'drive', 'do', 'Instead', 'going', 'library', 'study', 'watch', 'skaters', 'have', 'fun', 'dreams', 'joining', 'dissatisfied', 'Sarah', 'Brad', 'meet', 'instant', 'connection', 'slowly', 'affair', 'pace', 'slow', 'uninteresting', 'constant', 'narration', 'using', 'voice-over', 'old', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'are', 'added', 'elements', 'bring', 'complexity', 'mix', 'pervert', 'living', 'neighborhood', 'having', 'everyone', 'edge', 'cop', 'issues', 'dealing', 'past', 'present', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'movie.The', 'main', 'problem', 'have', 'film', 'flow', 'story', 'was', 'not', 'able', 'catch', 'attention', 'therefore', 'few', 'plusses', 'acting', 'were', 'lost', 'morass', 'boredom', 'was', 'extremely', 'disappointed', 'was', 'highly', 'recommended', 'several', 'friends', 'may', 'be', 'minority', 'disliking', 'one', 'opinion', 'not', 'much', 'like']",N/A

But the tale of the two married couples at the centre of the plot never really interweaves with that of the released sex offender; at least not until the end of the film. For most of the movie we see the two stories side by side. This leads to a feeling that these themes have been artificially juxtaposed; a feeling which is reinforced by the unconvincing turn of events in the final scenes.

1053027,A1VABWDOUQLULZ,B000N3SU92,S. K. Harrell,"[2, 2]","Based on the book of the same name by Tom Perotta, Little Children gives a glimpse into how a group of adults relate to children (and in some cases how they do not relate to children at all), and the shadow side of suburbia.  We have the gaggle of gossiping  stay-at-home moms who schedule sex once a week and take the kids to the park for daily playdates where they ogle The Prom King, a stay-at-home dad who desperately tries to hide his bruised masculine ego behind his eclipsing unhappiness.  However, Sarah (Kate Winslet), a self-confessed nonsuburbanite, befriends him from her own stale despair, embarking on an illicit affair.  Add into the pro-family mix a convicted child offender who has been released to live nearby with his elderly mother, provoking a reaction from the suburbia that is nothing less than a trial by peers.The film moves a bit slowly, as each member of its ensemble is developed.  On all parts the acting is flawless.  Kate Winslet is stunning as ever.  We've seen her play the role of strong woman many times, so it is no surprise that she delivers Sarah with such ease.  Her fierce delivery of Sarah's plight and resolve is well-balanced with the character's primary flaw, which is that she's not particularly fond of motherhood, thus of her young daughter.  Jennifer Connelly brilliantly delivers a rather frigid power mom in an incredibly small amount of screen time as the partner to Patrick Wilson's Prom King.  The many layers of dysfunction in that relationship alone are a case study, which we see projected well through Connelly's suspicion of him and Wilson's confusion.  What is perhaps the most brilliant facet of this film is the character May McGorvey, the mother of the excon.  She is the only parent in the film who genuinely seems to have abiding affection for her child, and despite her desires for him to have a happy adjusted life she is not blinded to the reality of what he is.  The contradictions in that bond to the social assumptions about the childhoods of sex offenders is profound, further foiling the bent family dynamic presented through the entirety of this suburbia.This film is not heavy handed in its disturbing imagery, though it doesn't need to be.  The mere suggestion that Ronnie, the nervous exconvict, is an admitted psychosexual offender provides enough information to leave anyone on edge for the entire film.  I did find the narration of the film distracting and unnecessary.  At no point did it reveal information that was not already evident from the progression, and I questioned its purpose in moving the plot.  Such an understated film would have been stronger without the blatant narration.  Given that, the direction of this film is fantastic, in that it allows the story to tell itself.  Scene transitions were a bit rough resulting in a disjunct tone, but for the most part it flowed well.  It manages to deliver social commentary without being critical or hypocritical.

I like sad endings generally, but this ending ruins the rest of the movie for me.  The only reason it doesn't deserve 0 stars is because of the performance by Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson, but other than that, even though the story is quite intense, it's also a little choppy in some parts.  Jackie Earle Haley was pretty good in his disturbed role, but he was ""acting"" too much, so it lost some of the intensity that a role like this should have had.And, it is DEFINITELY an adult-only movie, not just because of the sex scenes, but because of the content.

1053029,AT07UZQQR7ZEH,B000N3SU92,"Stephen H. Wood ""Film scholar and vintage mov...","[3, 4]","I am slowly getting caught up on DVD with those 2006 art films that did not play at my suburban San Francisco multiplex, including Todd Field's sad and disturbing treasure, LITTLE CHILDREN.  This masterpiece is the kind of complex adult drama I loved watching at UCLA when I was a student in the 1970s, then discussing with friends over pie and coffee at a restaurant or dorm lounge for hours.  It is exquisitely acted, powerfully written and directed, and stunningly filmed (by Antonio Calvache) in Panavision and soft colors.  It is unquestionably one of the finest films of the last decade, and it plays wondrously on the intimacy of home video in a night bedroom.In a small New York state town where everyone knows everyone else's secrets, Sarah (Oscar-nominated Kate Winslet in a luminous performance) catches her husband in his study masturbating while watching porn sex on his computer.  It is too much for her on top of him being endlessly boring.  Sarah takes her young daughter Lucy and simultaneously has a sexual relationship with Brad (Patrick Wilson), who is married to Jennifer Connelly and cannot seem to pass the bar exam to be a lawyer; Connelly hassles him about that so Sarah is a breath of fresh air in a town park.  This is a town of haunting failed ambitions and relationships.  The source is a 2004 novel by Tom Perotta, who co-wrote the script with director Field.  Using a voice-over narration, the movie is thrillingly literate, with adult characters and complex conflicts.  Sex scenes with full nudity are matter-of-fact and not gratuitous.  Winslet is my favorite contemporary actress.  No other young actress has gotten so many Oscar nominations (this is #5) at such a young age (I think 31) playing so many unusual performances in mostly uncommercial art films.  She also doesn't care how she looks if the role is great, which she shares with Bette Davis (mercifully without  Davis' endless cigarettes).  So we have two adult characters both committing adultery.  Will they get away with it and be happy?  Let's leave that a secret.In the performance of a second lifetime (he was a child actor in the 1970s), Oscar nominee Jackie Earle Haley plays a scalding supporting role as Ronnie, a sex pervert who served his time in jail and now is back in the same town where his crime was committed.  Boy, do the townspeople know that and won't stand for it one minute.  They put up pervert signs, use a bullhorn outside his mother's house (he lives with her in middle age), and have their children all flee from a swimming pool like a shark attack in JAWS when poor Ronnie just wants to peacefully cool off on a hot day.  What happens to the complex and immensely likeable Ronnie should not be revealed here.  But he is a heartbreakingly sad character that Haley gives layers and layers of complexity to.  He truly deserved the Oscar last year that Alan Arkin got for LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE.  Arkin is fun, but not even in the same hemisphere with the towering Haley.  His final scene burns through celluloid, in tandem with Sarah's final scene with daughter Lucy.  I was crying.  The voice-over last line is extraordinary:  ""The past cannot be changed, but the future can.""LITTLE CHILDREN may endure as one of the great adult dramas of the past twenty years.  I did not care for Todd Field's previous film, IN THE BEDROOM (2001), mostly because star Sissy Spacek was gratuitously smoking Marlboros too much, as if the cigarette company subsidized that low-budget film.  Red boxes were heavy-handedly lying around on tables.  The film also had characters I could not stand.  But I really care about the adult and real and complicated and sympathetic characters in the magnificent LITTLE CHILDREN.  The movie is an absolute must-see for mature adults.  It may haunt your very soul for weeks afterword.  Be sure to rent or buy it in widescreen because it is in 2.35 Panavision.",5,One of the great adult dramas of the last 20 years,1178323200,"05 5, 2007",2007,3897,"['am', 'slowly', 'getting', 'caught', 'up', 'DVD', '2006', 'art', 'films', 'did', 'not', 'play', 'suburban', 'San', 'Francisco', 'multiplex', 'including', 'Todd', 'Field', 'sad', 'disturbing', 'treasure', 'LITTLE', 'CHILDREN', 'masterpiece', 'kind', 'complex', 'adult', 'drama', 'loved', 'watching', 'UCLA', 'when', 'was', 'student', '1970s', 'then', 'discussing', 'friends', 'pie', 'coffee', 'restaurant', 'dorm', 'lounge', 'hours', 'exquisitely', 'acted', 'powerfully', 'written', 'directed', 'stunningly', 'filmed', 'Antonio', 'Calvache', 'Panavision', 'soft', 'colors', 'unquestionably', 'one', 'finest', 'films', 'last', 'decade', 'wondrously', 'intimacy', 'home', 'video', 'night', 'bedroom.In', 'small', 'New', 'York', 'state', 'town', 'where', 'everyone', 'everyone', 'else', 'secrets', 'Sarah', 'Oscar-nominated', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'luminous', 'performance', 'husband', 'study', 'masturbating', 'watching', 'porn', 'sex', 'computer', 'too', 'much', 'top', 'being', 'endlessly', 'boring', 'Sarah', 'young', 'daughter', 'Lucy', 'simultaneously', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'Brad', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'who', 'married', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'can', 'not', 'seem', 'pass', 'bar', 'exam', 'be', 'lawyer', 'Connelly', 'so', 'Sarah', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'town', 'park', 'town', 'haunting', 'failed', 'ambitions', 'relationships', 'source', '2004', 'novel', 'Tom', 'Perotta', 'who', 'co-wrote', 'script', 'director', 'Field', 'Using', 'voice-over', 'narration', 'movie', 'thrillingly', 'literate', 'adult', 'characters', 'complex', 'conflicts', 'Sex', 'scenes', 'full', 'nudity', 'are', 'matter-of-fact', 'not', 'gratuitous', 'Winslet', 'favorite', 'contemporary', 'actress', 'other', 'young', 'actress', 'gotten', 'so', 'many', 'Oscar', 'nominations', '5', 'young', 'age', 'think', '31', 'playing', 'so', 'many', 'unusual', 'performances', 'mostly', 'uncommercial', 'art', 'films', 'also', ""n't"", 'care', 'how', 'role', 'great', 'shares', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'mercifully', 'Davis', 'endless', 'cigarettes', 'have', 'two', 'adult', 'characters', 'committing', 'adultery', 'Will', 'get', 'away', 'be', 'happy', 'Let', 'leave', 'secret.In', 'performance', 'second', 'lifetime', 'was', 'child', 'actor', '1970s', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'Jackie', 'Earle', 'Haley', 'scalding', 'supporting', 'role', 'Ronnie', 'sex', 'pervert', 'who', 'served', 'time', 'jail', 'now', 'back', 'same', 'town', 'where', 'crime', 'was', 'committed', 'Boy', 'do', 'townspeople', 'know', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stand', 'one', 'minute', 'put', 'up', 'pervert', 'signs', 'use', 'bullhorn', 'mother', 'house', 'middle', 'age', 'have', 'children', 'flee', 'swimming', 'pool', 'shark', 'attack', 'JAWS', 'when', 'poor', 'Ronnie', 'just', 'peacefully', 'cool', 'off', 'hot', 'day', 'What', 'complex', 'immensely', 'likeable', 'Ronnie', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'revealed', 'here', 'heartbreakingly', 'sad', 'character', 'Haley', 'layers', 'layers', 'complexity', 'truly', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'last', 'year', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'got', 'LITTLE', 'MISS', 'SUNSHINE', 'Arkin', 'fun', 'not', 'even', 'same', 'hemisphere', 'towering', 'Haley', 'final', 'scene', 'burns', 'celluloid', 'tandem', 'Sarah', 'final', 'scene', 'daughter', 'Lucy', 'was', 'crying', 'voice-over', 'last', 'line', 'extraordinary', 'past', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'changed', 'future', 'can', 'LITTLE', 'CHILDREN', 'may', 'endure', 'one', 'great', 'adult', 'dramas', 'past', 'twenty', 'years', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'Todd', 'Field', 'previous', 'film', 'IN', 'THE', 'BEDROOM', '2001', 'mostly', 'star', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'was', 'gratuitously', 'smoking', 'Marlboros', 'too', 'much', 'cigarette', 'company', 'subsidized', 'low-budget', 'film', 'Red', 'boxes', 'were', 'heavy-handedly', 'lying', 'around', 'tables', 'film', 'also', 'had', 'characters', 'could', 'not', 'stand', 'really', 'care', 'adult', 'real', 'complicated', 'sympathetic', 'characters', 'magnificent', 'LITTLE', 'CHILDREN', 'movie', 'absolute', 'must-see', 'mature', 'adults', 'may', 'haunt', 'very', 'soul', 'weeks', 'afterword', 'Be', 'sure', 'rent', 'buy', 'widescreen', '2.35', 'Panavision']",N/A

1053031,AZCDCO6KK2T81,B000N3SU92,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[6, 8]","The performances are nearly all top-shelf in this study of dysfunctional suburbia.Amazon's review/synopsis and the spotlight reviews all really nail down well what this film's about, so, as I've done in the past when I have nothing to add regarding the usual plot info, I will just discuss specific elements that resonated with me.If I can overly simplify this film for a moment, I would like to say that it seems to be taking note to our new way of justifying infidelity and how, even as adults, we act like ""Little Children"" by only considering how we can meet our own needs over those around us.  The two main characters are seriously bored with their lives, their roles in their families, and their utter insignificance in the world around them.  Their resentments toward their individual spouses only builds each day and most especially when they focus on their spouse's flaws and not their own.  This is not to say that their spouses don't have significant flaws or the adulterers are just being petty.  I just find that they begin to keep mental score cards to later justify their actions and that doesn't sit right with me.Once these two adulterers have built up enough resentment and added up all their spouse's flaws they seem to take great pride in exacting some kind of quiet revenge on their spouses by having sex in each other's homes during their kids' nap time, meeting daily like a happy couple, degrading their spouse's to each, and plotting to leave their spouses even when such actions endanger their own children or even themselves.  These two act very much like children who only see their own needs and whine about how their lives are ""unfair.""  Winslett's character even associates herself with the famous literary figure Madame Bovary, who was trapped by her time period and the oppressive part of marriage in her day.  Winslett's considers her own actions in cheating on her husband as being as ""noble"" as Madame Bovary's cheating which she proclaims as an action that is praiseworthy for struggling against oppresive conformity.  The comparison to her own life to Madame Bovary's life is ludicrous at best and shamefully self-serving at worse.  At this point, Winslett's character seems to think she and Bovary are alike in their struggles and nothing could be further from the truth.It's sad to see that not ONCE do the two main characters EVER open up to their spouses about how they feel.  They stereotypically act like their spouses are supposed to read their minds.  Neither one ever brings up for discussion their hurts or complaints.  Winslett, once she discovers her husband's bizarre obsession, tells her husband the infamous line, ""We need to talk,"" but, sadly, when he's willing to, she comes back with, ""I'm too tired for this now"" and NEVER brings it up again.  Her lover is the same way in his passive-aggressive manner with his spouse who is generally aloof, but seems like an overall decent person who just isn't sensitive to her husband's needs.In addition, neither lover EVER considers family counseling or even divorce.  Instead, they both plot to run off together with their kids with no notice of discontentment to their individual spouses who would probably be rather shocked by their actions.  Again, doesn't this all seem rather childish?  Running off into the sunset and all . . . Oh, please!  I guess I come from the ""Dr. Phil"" camp where he says you have to ""earn your way out of relationship since you willingly earned your way into it"", and, in regards to cheating, ""that it is an inappropriate and inexcusable response to legitimate problems in the marriage.""  These two lovers seem to care about no one but themselves.Sadly, these two are not the only ones acting like little children.  The lunch date park mom's are about as caddy and stereotypical as high school girl nerds trying to overthrow the popular cheerleaders.  Even more sad is that these stereotypes ring all too true here.  As a father who typically takes his kids to the park, I've met these women in real life.  You have the know-it-all mom who has the answer for every ill in the world with a trite clich&eacute;-ridden comment.  You have another who pushes others in the group to do something out of the ordinary when she herself won't do it, and another who is just a follower, and all three will comment on the world around them as if they are above it all.  Stereotypical?  Yes.  Believable?  Yes.Of course, we can't forget the subplot that circles around the pedophile that connects to this film's title.  He obviously connects to the film's title in that he sickly desires little children, acts very childlike himself, and is treated much like a child by his mother.  In addition, their are the childish acts of those that don't want him in the neighborhood and go about making that known by plastering posters about him in all over town, including all over the house he lives in with his mother.  They write obscenities on his front sidewalk, curse at his mother, and use loudspeakers at night in front of his house.  Can I understand some of these actions as a parent myself?  Absolutely, but I also want to be a role model for my kids and many of these actions are not just questionable, but down right childish and evil themselves.Even one of the pedophile's greatest enemies admits he went too far and recites a line I hear all too often from my own students when something goes tragically wrong, ""I didn't think this would happen.""  It's like going to a street rumble with a knife or gun and then saying, ""I didn't think anyone would get killed.""  Most children and teenagers don't see how their actions affect others or the potential for disaster with certain behavior and that is all too typically displayed in this film.Little Children is a compelling story because the actors are first-rate, the storyline is something we can all relate to in some manner, and the characters are people that we've met and can understand.  I've been very hard on my assessment of them, but it is because of the wrong and immoral decisions that they make with little regard for others; however, we have all done things that are selfish and the famous, albeit clich&eacute; line, ""For there but the grace of God walk I"" rings in my ear while watching this film.  Who hasn't been bored in a marriage?  Who hasn't quietly kept a scorecard in their head for their spouse's flaws and arguments won and lost within a marriage?  Who hasn't imagined a life more exciting and meaningful?  Who hasn't looked at another man or woman and wondered ""what if . . .""  We can all act and think like children at times, and this film brilliantly focuses on just how easy can be to act on those thought and impulses.",4,"A difficult meal to digest, but brilliantly

1053033,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000N3SU92,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[22, 26]","****1/2There is a lot going on in ""Little Children"", starring Kate Winslet, Patrick Wilson (the musical version of ""Phantom of the Opera"" and ""Hard Candy"") and Jennifer Connelly. I am not sure I even caught everything or understood all that I caught.Sarah Pierce (Winslet), a new stay at home mom, struggles with the solitude of her new role. Spending every moment with a three year old, who can barely communicate, tests the patience of the one-time English scholar. Sarah has a Masters, but ruefully admits she never wrote her dissertation and never received her PhD. One day, at a local playground, she interacts with a group of suburban moms and the differences are clear. They embrace motherhood, in different ways, making sure to bring snacks for the children's play break, and seem to relish all that their new role brings. One day, Brad (Wilson), a stay at home dad, who is supposed to be studying for his bar exam, brings his son to the playground. The three women quickly inform Sarah they have nicknamed him ""The Prom King"", because of his good looks. Sarah is amazed to find they have never talked to him. ""He makes us nervous."" One of the women bets Sarah five dollars that she won't get his phone number. Sarah not only gets his phone number, but he lets him in on the joke and they hug and kiss, to the shock of the uptight mothers. Soon, Brad, thoroughly emasculated by his wife, Kathy (Connelly), becomes slightly obsessed with finding ways to demonstrate he can still produce testosterone. For every time his wife talks him out of getting a cell phone, he stops to watch a group of teenage boys doing impressive skateboard moves. For every time she questions if he `really needs' that subscription to Sports Illustrated or Men's Fitness, he meets up with a group of guys and joins a nighttime Touch Football League. Soon, Sarah and Brad start a passionate affair. All the while, their quiet suburban community deals with Ronnie McGorvey (Jackie Earle Haley), a convicted pedophile who has just been released from prison. He returns to his mother's (Phyllis Somerville) home and she helps him endure the constant taunts of an overzealous neighbor, Larry Hedges (Noah Emmerich, the brother of the head of New Line Cinema who produced the film). Soon, all these people's fates will intersect in strange, unusual and interesting ways.""Little Children"", directed by Todd Field (""In the Bedroom"") and based on a book by Tom Perrotta, who co-wrote the screenplay with Field, may just end up being one of the best films of the year. But it feels a little less than perfect.The performances of the three leads are all outstanding. Kate Winslet, who has chosen many interesting roles throughout her career, continues this streak with Sarah Pierce. As the mid-30s mom of a three year old, she demonstrates many conflicting things with just about every word, every nuance. As a new mother, she clearly loves her daughter, but she feels stifled by the constant companionship of her daughter, longing for some adult conversation, some adult interaction. The second wife of an older man, she doesn't seem to have much need for her husband and he for her. She counts the minutes for him to return home, so she can spend a little time with a neighborhood friend doing her fitness walk. During the daily visit to the playground, she would probably find some comfort in the companionship of the other three mothers, but they are even less mature than she is. One, a domineering bully, insists her child adhere to a rigid schedule. She has carried this so far to schedule a weekly appointment to have sex with her husband. Another is clearly flirtatious and wants Sarah to do the daring things she is unable to. Then, Sarah meets Brad and is clearly attracted to the handsome young father.Brad (Wilson), loves his wife and freely admits she is a knockout, but because he is a stay at home dad, and money is tight, they have to watch every penny. His wife (Connelly) makes documentaries for PBS (we all know there isn't a lot of money in that) and they frequently receive help from her mother. After watching their son all day, he is sent to the library every night, to study for the bar exam, something he deems a fruitless pursuit. Instead, he spends most evenings watching a group of kids do stunts on their skateboards. One night, Bob pulls up and recruits him for a Touch Football game with a bunch of his former work colleagues, a group of cops. These few moments with other men, prove to be just the little boost he needs to maintain his sanity. Then he meets Sarah, and although he admits she isn't his type, they begin a passionate affair.Connelly's role, as Brad's wife, would technically be considered a supporting role, but it is equally important to the tapestry of the film. It isn't that Brad and Kathy don't love each other, they do, they are just too immature to express it. When Kathy suspects Brad of having an affair, she enlists the aid of her mother to come for a visit and `help Brad watch Aaron', their son. Soon, Grandma follows Brad everywhere, robbing him of any opportunity to have sex with Sarah.Jackie Earle Haley is also very good as Ronnie, the recently released pedophile. Clearly, this is a man who has not been `cured', but because he has served his time, he is released to live with his aging mother. May worries about her son. She knows he did something wrong, but she wants him to try to live a normal live. She won't be around forever and worries about what will happen to him after he dies.There are a lot of nice touches to the characters. Sarah joins a book group in which they discuss ""Madame Bovary"", a book she used to dislike but finds she know enjoys. Brad ditches an appointment, much like a petulant teenager forced to do something they don't want to do, because Sarah entices him to spend the time with her instead. Ronnie's mother is portrayed as a caring, doting mother who cares about her son and will continue to defend him until the day she dies.Director Todd Field has created two very impressive films so far. Field is clearly a director who will only work when a particular project strikes his fancy (""In the Bedroom"" was made over five years ago) and his attention to the project shows in almost every detail. Not only is ""Little Children"" well-written, it is a fairly unique experience as you watch it on the screen.Using a narrator, the director adds a literary feel to the film. Initially, this was a little off-putting to me, but Field introduces the technique early, uses it sparingly, and it doesn't feel obtrusive. Occasionally, the narrator adds a little levity to the story or further illuminates the feelings of a particular character. I was afraid this technique would detract from the performances, but if anything, it adds to them.""Children"" is, at times, a darkly humorous film. I found myself laughing out loud a few times and I realized the filmmaker intended this. At the same time, you also realize that many of the things you are laughing at are slightly exaggerated events that could happen in any of our lives. As you laugh, you may recognize you are uneasy because many of the things these people do are slightly unusual, or even a little unpleasant. For instance, Sarah's husband has a fetish which is revealed to us. It is initially funny, but we soon realize it is probably more common than we know. As we laugh, we also cringe because we probably know someone who has a similar fetish. Maybe a fetish we have always suspected, but were afraid to admit.The story, set in an Eastern suburb (I would imagine New York or Boston), is shot in a beautiful, almost luminous way. Every scene seems just slightly oversaturated, giving the film's summer setting another nod.Also, Field has designed a unique sound for the film. In many scenes, much of the ambient noise is reduced to favor a particular sound. As this is a suburb, a set of busy train tracks runs through the back of the community. Frequently, we hear the sound of a large train speeding down the tracks, further reinforcing a character's isolation or desperation. In one scene, the sound of many clocks becomes oppressive. In another, crickets become the only sound heard, despite cars driving by. Because of this unique sound design, our other senses become heightened and in a film, the only other sense that matters is our vision. I felt like I was watching the film more intently, with a keener eye.As good as Haley's portrayal of Ronnie is, and as interesting as the relationship between he and his mother is to watch, the character seems slightly unnecessary. As with the other characters, we spend a significant amount of time with Ronnie and his mother and the purpose of these characters seems to simply reinforce the main message of the film, which we already get. It isn't a problem to watch them, but it just seems a little superfluous.There are a number of powerful scenes in ""Little Children"", some of which I will remember for a long time. The scenes between Brad and Sarah, when they are having sex, are passionate, explicit and convey the desperation of their lives and the solace they find in one another. Kathy learns of her son's new friend and suggests to Brad that they invite the family over. Without saying a word, Connelly expresses volumes about her character's knowledge of the affair between Brad and Sarah. Each of the character's desperation to lead a different life is expressed in believable ways. A date between Ronnie and a homely woman is also particularly memorable.""Little Children"" is a very good, almost excellent film containing some great performances. It is a film that will stay with you. And that is, in some ways a good thing, in others, bad.""Little Children"" is a film that deserves to be remembered during Oscar season, but I fear one of two things will happen. Either it will be completely overlooked, or it will receive nominations and not a single award. The film is a tightly integrated ensemble piece. If one person receives recognition, they all do.",5,A Sure Oscar Contender...,1160352000,"10 9, 2006",2006,10040,"['lot', 'going', 'Little', 'Children', 'starring', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Patrick',

She spends her days enduring miserable playground playdates with the neighborhood mothers.  She's the designated ditzy mother, who forgets to bring her daughter's snack and even fails to bond with her child.  At one point, she compares herself to an anthropologist studying a foreign culture, so alienated is she from her fellow mothers.  Into this morass stumbles Patrick Wilson playing Brad, the only stay-at-home father in the neighborhood.  The women are fascinated by Brad and quickly nickname him ""The Prom King.""  However, despite their fantasies about Brad, they're petrified to actually admit this handsome young father into their group.  One day, Sarah does precisely that.The movie is ultimately about isolation, which is even more strongly seen in a subplot concerning Jackie Earle Haley.  His character returns home following a conviction for exposing himself to a child.  The townspeople react to him with predictable venom, even as their own misdeeds unfold before our eyes.  This moral ambiguity permeates every frame of ""Little Children,"" turning a good drama into something more transcendent - something much more akin to real life.  Indeed, characters go from likeable to pathetic and back again within a blink of an eye, all lead by the brilliant acting of Winslet.Todd Field's follow-up to 2001's ""In the Bedroom"" is masterfully directed.  Fortunately, ""Little Children"" manages to avoid the melodrama that marred his earlier effort.  The Oscar nominated screenplay by Todd Field and Tom Perrotta is based on Perrotta's novel of the same name.  The script doesn't always flow perfectly, with frequent jumps between subplots and sometimes jarring changes in tone.  However, the plot avoids predictability, with just a few missteps toward the end.

My God, people go on about how liberal (and most actors are) Hollywood supposedly is, but constantly every film that comes out with a controversial premise (""The Good Girl"", ""Bridges of Madison County"", and this one with adultery; ""Knocked Up"" with abortion and unplanned pregnancy) winds up with a finish that even Falwell could love. In the case of the adultery films, the woman who has been suffering in a boring, loveless marriage to a guy who is now in the role of her brother with no blood ties meets an exciting, passionate man who is everything of which she has dreamt. She falls madly in love with this man, very seriously (to the point of packing everything she values and leaving a ""Dear John"" letter to hubby) contemplates leaving her ""picture perfect"" but otherwise dead relationship, but in the end she stays with schmucko and the kids and remains (much like the Aniston film's title) the long suffering ""Good Girl"". I'm sorry, but my parents stayed together in such a marriage and everyday my father reminds her of her dalliance (even though it happened decades ago). These films do not show that side of the families ""sticking it out"". It doesn't show the emotional (and often physical) abuse that often follows when a man finds out that his wife has cheated on him. When a woman (or a man, for that matter) cheats, it usually (but not always) means that her/his emotional needs are not being met in the marriage. It also can mean that the marriage, as a passionate relationship between two adults, is dead and if the two remain together, it is simply to co-parent the children (which the children will know, by the way, and it scars them just as much, if not more, than if the parents went their separate ways and found happiness with others). I honestly enjoyed this film; I did. The acting was first rate, the dialogue was well written, and it was a very interesting peak into what ""Desperate Housewives"" should had been about. However, just as a note to Hollywood: could you please, please have a film in which the depressed, lonely, suffering wife actually runs off with her lover and actually finds happiness (instead of playing the martyr or killing herself a la Anna Karenina)? Is that really too much to ask, instead of these Sunday school lessons that you've been pushing on us since the invention of moving pictures? Loving relationships can (I know that the Moral Majority will devour me for saying this, but oh well) and do spring from affairs.

It's the simply stated mixture of superb acting, tremendous directing, and solid story that makes for an in-depth look at normal people in extraordinary situations, and not-so-extraordinary situations.Kate Winslett and Patrick Wilson are married, but not to each other. Both of them are feeling bored and unfulfilled in their lives. Wilson's wife, Jennifer Connelly, is always working, as is Winslet's husband. When they meet one day in a local park, amidst the gossiping housewives and the young children playing, a secret bond is formed between them.As they go on outing after outing to the city pool, the sexual tension slowly builds until it explodes into a love affair that the two are carried away by like teenagers. This could be a simple story of deceit and selfishness, but director Todd Fields and writer (novel and screenplay) Tom Perrotta make it so much more.With the background story of a pedophile (Jackie Earle Haley in his Oscar nominated performance) Little Children enters into darker territory with unrelenting power. Noah Emmerich also turns in a remarkable performance as a troubled ex-policeman obsessed with monitoring the pedophile's every move.By the end, viewers will find themselves fully invested in every character choice made by these outstanding actors, which only allows the story itself to affect more deeply with every minute that passes. If you enjoy good acting, cinematography, and story-telling, don't miss Little Children.In an age of overstated, overdone Hollywood films, Little Children is the opposite.

1053046,A3ADK3ZTJ87915,B000N3SU92,"Zinta Aistars ""Writer & Editor""","[2, 2]","In spite of its three Academy Award nominations, I had not heard of this movie, came across it merely by browsing the shelves at my neighborhood video store. Since I've been seeing quite a few Kate Winslet movies of late, most of which have ranged from interesting to impressive, I rented the movie on the strength of her name. Good decision. ""Little Children"" at this point ranks, in my mind, as Winslet's best performance to date.The various intertwining plots of this movie, narrated with wonderful lines from a Tom Perotta novel, would ordinarily have disturbed me if not inclined me to leave it on the shelf. And it *was* disturbing. Again and again, it made me cringe, and wince, and fidget, and roll my eyes, and sigh with exasperation. But keep watching. These are the ""little children"" (immature adults without control over their adolescent whims and whines) of a wealthier suburbia, including adulterous couples, cooling and troubled marriages, neglected but well adorned children, bored wives, fantasy-ridden husbands, porn-addicted executives, and the neighborhood pedophile living with Mommy, as he calls her, because who else would have him?Opening on a gated playground scene with mothers seated on a bench, only Winslet's character, Sarah Pierce, on a separate bench, watching their children at play, a young father (Patrick Wilson) with stroller enters the grounds - and the heads of the wives turn en masse. Prom King, they call him, and the fantasies of the bored wives quickly surround the pleasant young father as he plays with his little son at a distance. Nothing more desirable than a man playing with his child... only Sarah can hardly bear the cheap chatter of the women, and more to break it up than out of interest in the Prom King, she approaches him, gets his phone number on a dare, goes in for a hug to scandalize, and then, caught up in the tease of the horrified other mothers, lands a sensual kiss on the stranger.And onward and upward and hotter from there we go.The trigger for Sarah to unleash an affair, however, is not the kiss (although he, the recipient, can't stop thinking about it, even as he contemplates the cold superiority of his businesswoman wife who treats him more like a child than a husband - an interesting reversal of roles), but the discovery of her husband at home heaving and panting in front of a computer screen filled with a virtual stripping woman. Sarah is filled with disgust, her respect for her husband disintegrates, and when she searches and finds a wastebasket beneath the computer filled with stiffened tissues, she realizes she has encountered an ongoing addiction. Rather than confront her husband, she represses her disgust and unhappiness, as too many women do in similar situations, and purchases instead a scarlet red bathing suit in order to feel desirable again and heads to the neighborhood pool where the Prom King hangs out every summer afternoon. What pretends to be a new friendship soon is a full-blown affair.An interesting moment between the two takes place when Sarah asks her new lover if his wife is pretty. Oh yes, drop dead gorgeous, he tosses off his shrugging appraisal, but ""beauty is highly overrated,"" he says, oblivious to the insult he has just paid his new lover, and as the narrator inserts - it takes a great kind of arrogance in one's own beauty to be so disparaging of another. But however tossed off, his comment reveals a deeper truth: the two are extraordinarily compatible and similar in their family torments and the beating each has sustained on their marital ego.Throughout this development of an affair, other sideline stories and characters evolve. There is the story of a pedophile (Jackie Earle Haley) and his mother (Phyllis Somerville), his deep attachment and dependence on her, the only human being who still cares about him, even as his behavior continues, sending the neighborhood into gyrations of horror and fear. There is the story of the bully cop (Noah Emmerich), just this side of being a criminal himself, who deteriotes into a vigilante chasing the pedophile, causing far more harm than good. And there are many rich and memorable scenes, which include a gathering of elderly neighborhood women with a few younger ones for spice, discussing the novel, Gustave Flaubert's riotous ""Madame Bovary."" There is the neighborhood's men's football team, and the portrayal of their often clumsy male bonding and destructive competition. Another winning scene has the cheated-upon wife, played by Jennifer Connelly, who mostly blends into background for other characters, observing a conversation between her husband and neighbor Sarah. As perhaps only women can, she understands from the most casual exchange between the two that there is far more intimacy between them than a man and woman friend should share. There is no raucous fireworks revelation of the affair, simply a silent observation, and a woman's instinct. She knows. Nor does she tell him that she knows. Again, like most women, she holds her knowledge inside, to quietly observe and await his hitting his own wall.For all its moments of discomfort, as so many of our hidden life stories and opened closet doors may cause, this entire story is exquisitely developed, with top level acting, nuanced dialogue, and meaning that unfolds upon even deeper meaning when the layers of masks humanity wears come off. The story concludes with a surprising twist that is also highly satisfying, yet no more ""pretty"" than life usually is. Not even in a wealthy corner of suburbia.",5,When the Masks of Children Come Off...,1178496000,"05 7, 2007",2007,5553,"['spite', 'three', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominations', 'had', 'not', 'heard',
