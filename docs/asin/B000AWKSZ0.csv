I've only watched a small chunk thus far but i have to say this is one of the most epic concerts ever captured!I was luckey enough to see one of GBV's last shows ever (they're last NYC show ever at Irving Plaza) but i am sad to say that was the first time i ever got to see them. They didn't treat it like a funeral, more like a celebration of life. For the $30 i paid for the ticket, Uncle Bob and the boys gave us a solid 3 and half hours or so of entertainment and rock n'roll as only GBV could deliver!This DVD captures that celebration and it's something i wish i had gotten to experience more! I've seen Robert Pollard twice since GBV broke up and plan to do so again within the next month or so but GBV is hold a special place in history, this seals it!",4,Gone but Not Forgotten!,1160438400,"10 10, 2006",2006,853,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'meaning', 'buy', 'DVD', 'came', 'out', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'till', 'today', ""'ve"", 'only', 'watched', 'small', 'chunk', 'thus', 'far', 'i', 'have', 'say', 'one', 'most', 'epic', 'concerts', 'ever', 'captured', 'was', 'luckey', 'enough', 'see', 'one', 'GBV', 'last', 'shows', 'ever', ""'re"", 'last', 'NYC', 'show', 'ever', 'Irving', 'Plaza', 'i', 'am', 'sad', 'say', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'i', 'ever', 'got', 'see', 'did', ""n't"", 'treat', 'funeral', 'more', 'celebration', 'life', '30', 'i', 'paid', 'ticket', 'Uncle', 'Bob', 'boys', 'gave', 'solid', '3', 'half', 'hours', 'so', 'entertainment', 'rock', ""n'roll"", 'only', 'GBV', 'could', 'deliver', 'DVD', 'celebration', 'something', 'i', 'wish', 'i', 'had', 'gotten', 'experience', 'more', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Robert', 'Pollard', 'twice', 'GBV', 'broke', 'up', 'plan', 'do', 'so', 'again', 'next', 'month', 'so', 'GBV', 'hold', 'special', 'place', 'history']",N/A
933846,A3JPFWKS83R49V,B000AWKSZ0,"Bryan Carey ""Bryan Carey""","[0, 0]","Guided by Voices is a band I have been listening to for a long time. Since I am originally from Dayton, Ohio, I knew about GBV long before most of the world and I have even had the pleasure of meeting and talking to Bob Pollard on a few occasions following the band's live performances in Dayton and in Columbus, Ohio. This DVD marks the end of an era and Pollard and crew go out in style, with an incredibly long farewell show that includes old and new Guided by Voices tunes and a reunion with the many musicians who have been GBV members over the years.Let's talk about the music first because this is the main reason why fans of the band will want to own this DVD. This concert contains performances of 63 songs (!) performed over the course of the New Year's Eve evening on December 31, 2004, providing just over four hours of music, fun, and reminiscing. Fans of the band will recognize most of the songs on the list, but I admit that even I, a longtime fan, didn't recognize a few of the tunes at first. ""Chief Barrel Belly"", for example, is a song I hadn't heard in a long time. Some research shows that this song was originally released on the album Self- Inflicted Aerial Nostalgia. Another one I didn't recognize at first was ""Pink Gun"", released on the album Clown Prince of the Menthol Trailer. These albums are difficult to find, and I hadn't heard these songs in many years.The inclusion of rare tunes is interesting but there are plenty of well- known songs on this farewell set. Motor Away, Teenage FBI, I am a Scientist, Glad Girls, and other classic GBV songs are performed for the last time, culminating at the end of the second encore with one of my personal favorites, Don't Stop Now, a song originally released on the album ""Under the Bushes, Under the Stars"". Surprisingly, there are many well- known songs left off of this final song list, like Bulldog Skin, Hold on Hope, Official Ironman Rally Song, Surgical Focus, and many others. Guided by Voices has accumulated a large library of songs over the years thanks to the prolific songwriting of Bob Pollard so it is understandable that some songs would have to be left out. But the exclusion of certain classic songs is sure to disappoint old fans of the group who view this DVD hoping to hear all of the band's best tunes.When Guided by Voices isn't performing, Pollard is either talking to the audience, introducing an old friend or band member, or helping himself to the bar on the side of the stage. Guided by Voices has changed its lineup many times over the years and Pollard has been forced to replace many good musicians. Here, on stage, Pollard brings back many of the old members of the band for one final hurrah. Tobin Sprout (former guitar player for GBV), Jim MacPherson (former drummer), Jim Pollard (Bob's brother and former vocalist for the band), Jim Greer (former bass player) and others make appearances, helping to the complete the reunion and add a sense of closure to this final chapter in the Guided by Voices era.As far as the performance goes, let's just say this DVD presents live music in the classic Guided by Voices style. Pollard and the band are sharp at the beginning but they start to wear out near the end, in part because the performance is so long (more than four hours) and also because Pollard continues to indulge in liquor shots and bottles of cheap beer. There is nothing unusual about this (except for the inclusion of an actual bar next to the stage). Bob has been known to party hard during Guided by Voices shows and he almost always has, at the very least, a couple cases of beer at his disposal while he performs a show. Here, the length of the evening and the amount of drinking start to catch up with Pollard and when it gets down to the encore sets, his voice isn't quite as sharp as it was at the beginning. But in true Guided by Voices style, he doesn't let the fans down. He still sings the songs all the way through and continues to walk around the stage and interact with the audience all the way to the end.If this DVD wasn't already long enough, there are some extra features on the DVD to give fans more reasons to reminisce. One is a live performance that took place in Memphis, Tennessee on January 14, 1994. Another extra is live footage of Bob Pollard in (what appears to be) his house, recording demos for the songs ""Girls of Wild Strawberries"" and ""Window of my World"". The DVD also includes a booklet and a poster with linear notes from DJ Tom Sharpling and listing of the songs performed on this DVD.This DVD doesn't offer any glittery production like you often find on other music concert DVDs. The Electrifying Conclusion is much like the Guided by Voices albums of old, with low- fi production that is raw and unadulterated. More slick production would have made the songs sound cleaner and fresher but it wouldn't be true to the GBV sound.Overall, The Electrifying Conclusion is an interesting concert DVD to watch and it's a must for fans of Guided by Voices. It's a little saddening to think that this is really it; the last ever performance for Guided by Voices. But the band goes out in style, with an incredibly long set of songs (at four hours, it is the longest concert DVD I have ever seen), appearances from former band members, comments from fans, and old photos of Guided by Voices that will bring out the nostalgic side of GBV fans of all ages.",4,Guided by Voices: The Envitable End to One of Music's Most Creative Bands,1149811200,"06 9,

933848,A1FJCJJ6YLIU2K,B000AWKSZ0,"M. Derby ""drone45""","[21, 26]","My favorite GbV recordings are Bee Thousand, Alien Lanes, and Under the Bushes Under the Stars.  This is out of more than fifty releases by GbV, Robert Pollard or related projects:  and, of course, I'm crazy enough to have bought every one.All of the above will be familiar to GbV fans.What's revelatory about this concert DVD is the reinterpretation of songs--dating back to the ""classic GbV lineup""--by the most-recent incarnation of the band.No disrespect intended to Tobin or Mitch et al.  Their creative contributions were significant.  But not crucial.What made that triptych of records special was not the instrumental performances (nor the quirks of the lo-fi recording, interesting though they often were).  What made them special was the songwriting and singing of ""Pop Zeus"" Bob Pollard.Let's face it:  most of the members of the early GbV line-ups are not great musicians.Neither, of course, is Bob:  despite his intuitive grasp of how to write one brilliant hook after another, effortlessly.  The man--finally--looks comfortable on stage holding nothing but a microphone.  Even without clinging to his formerly ubiquitous beer bottles and cigarettes.  (In earlier days, he'd get restless when it was time for Tobin Sprout to sing one of his own compositions, leaving Bob with nothing much to do.)I wouldn't want to hear should-have-been-hits such as ""Goldheart Mountaintop Queen Directory"" or ""Motor Away"" remade as slick studio productions.(Not to imply, either, that the records made by later GbV line-ups were too slick.  Except Do The Collapse--still worthwhile for the songwriting--but oh boy, that is one slick CD!  I am able, though, to overlook Bob's effort to create a radio-friendly hit.  He deserves that kind of success, but it'll never happen.  He can't help it.  He's too intelligent and too ""weird"".  Meaning:  he always writes songs with non-linear words; the meaning--yes, there IS meaning--isn't sufficiently obvious for mass consumption.But hearing those songs performed live by skilled musicians?  Now THAT is a welcome innovation!It's the best of both worlds.  To hear the greatest GbV songs, performed by a superior band.  But in a live setting.  Here, they sound anything but ""slick"".  The immediacy of the music is...ummm...intoxicating.  Let's play ""Drinker's Peace"" again...I saw GbV live at about the time when Under the Bushes came out.  The energy was infectious.  But as the night wore on, and the band got more drunk, their performances deteriorated.  Badly.Yes, Bob's singing performance--however truly stunning it is, throughout most of the concert--begins to fall off toward the end of the disc.But how many singers can maintain that kind of passion for (nearly) four hours?  This is a marathon, and Bob is over forty.  It's a wonder he didn't leave the stage on a stretcher.What would I do without DVD?  I'm almost as old as Bob; my disability has worsened...I can never go to concerts anymore.Ahem...again, I digress.  One of my worst habits.Back to the review.  Hearing tracks like ""Chief Barrel Belly"", it's amazing how Bob's vocal delivery is more emotional than on the original, ancient recording...yet his enunciation is clearer.  Finally, you can comprehend great lyrics such as:Every man in this world:  get up and scream about it!Every dog has its day; I only dream about it(Well, the first line, at least, always sounded incoherent to my ears.  Might be faults in the ""production"", more than Bob's tendency--in the studio--to sing with the microphone nearly inside his mouth.  Most GbV recordings ""push the red"" constantly.  That's part of what makes them sound urgent and exciting.)""Chief Barrel Belly"" is from Self-Inflicted Aerial Nostalgia:  GbV's third LP, released independently in a tiny edition, years before the band were discovered by Scat Records, critics, and underground music fans everywhere.  (Now available as part of ""Box"")  The Matador label, of course, also merits props for making available most of GbV's best work.If I may digress a bit:  Forever Since Breakfast and Devil Between My Toes have their moments.  (The latter is also part of ""Box"".  The former is available only in the Hardcore UFOs box set:  unless you have hundreds to throw away on the original vinyl EP, assuming someone would actually sell their prized copy on eBay.)  Sandbox is nearly disposable (though ""Everyday"" is an early gem).  Self-Inflicted Aerial Nostalgia is the first consistently great GbV recording.OK...back to the concert.  Don't miss Bob's monologue before ""Secret Star"".  It's a rambling, dead-on-target spit-in-the-face to everyone who ever told him he was immature, wasting his time trying to be a rock star.Those new to GbV:  buy Bee Thousand.  Now.This disc is for the fans.  It's much more than a mere document of their historic final show.Many will--like me--find it too taxing to watch the entire thing in one sitting.  But the only reason it's an endurance test is the astounding running time (probably the longest concert video ever made which features only one band, with its more-than-65 songs packed into a single DVD).  Electrifying Conclusion is a joy to watch, from start to finish.Consider this disc another public service from distributor Plexifilm, who also released a DVD of Decasia:  with its hallucinatory images of decaying film, accompanied by music which seems to be played by a decaying orchestra.

I'm pretty disappointed.  Austin City Limits or even their appearance on HBO's Reverb is way better.  This DVD is full of nostalgia and fun to watch, but honestly...the picture quality looks like it was shot with a poor camera that couldn't cope with the club lighting and the sound is really poor for a professional release.  While the sound is sourced from the board, the mix is so bad it sounds like the soundman was as drunk as Bob.  You can barely tell the guitar parts apart. I don't regret buying it, but I guess I'll have to dig out the old VHS tapes to see a better GBV show with professional audio.",3,"Great performance, great show, poor production",1132617600,"11 22, 2005",2005,707,"['was', 'so', 'happy', 'see', 'GBV', 'would', 'finally', 'release', 'properly', 'documented', 'full-length', 'live', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'disappointed', 'Austin', 'City', 'Limits', 'even', 'appearance', 'HBO', 'Reverb', 'way', 'better', 'DVD', 'full', 'nostalgia', 'fun', 'watch', 'honestly', 'picture', 'quality', 'was', 'shot', 'poor', 'camera', 'could', ""n't"", 'cope', 'club', 'lighting', 'sound', 'really', 'poor', 'professional', 'release', 'sound', 'sourced', 'board', 'mix', 'so', 'bad', 'soundman', 'was', 'as', 'drunk', 'Bob', 'can', 'barely', 'tell', 'guitar', 'parts', 'apart', 'do', ""n't"", 'regret', 'buying', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'have', 'dig', 'out', 'old', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'see', 'better', 'GBV', 'show', 'professional', 'audio']",N/A
