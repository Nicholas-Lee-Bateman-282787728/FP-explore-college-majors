Palmer,"[0, 0]","I just saw this movie and it only proves, once again, that the producers / directors of these &#34;horse&#34; movies need a reliable consultant. At the very beginning, it showed someone wrapping a horse's leg. BACKWARDS !!!! Then it had a lovely scene at a horse show (Arabian  Regionals in Santa Barbara) that was passed off as a Thoroughbred show. Then, as the young girl was walking down a barn aisle, not only was she carrying an Arabian National garland, but it wasn't even the garland that had been presented in the horse show &#34;clip&#34;. I know that most viewers wouldn't pick up on these irregularities, but having owned and shown Arabian horses, (at Santa Barbara and the Arabian Nationals) and been on the show circuit for 30 years, this is an insult to my intelligence.

1660819,A422TIGQH6GJ5,B00DS79HBU,Rob,"[0, 0]","This one was utterly predictable start to finish, with a cloy plot that drags and styrofoam acting.  Still, as far as family films go it was fine, and plenty of scenes with a lovable mule and various show horses make this ideal for young kids into that kind of thing.  There's a little bit of romance - very predictable and contrived of course - but no real bad content.  In fact, I don't think there was one swear word, no major violence (there's a plane crash later in the film but with only minor injuries - you know, the little bit of blood by the side of the mouth kind of thing) and no adult content, so this is an ideal pizza-night family film if you're into that kind of thing.
