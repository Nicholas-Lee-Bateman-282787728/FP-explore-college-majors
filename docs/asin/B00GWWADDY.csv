1682549,A1M1H7B8QRT5U,B00GWWADDY,"Tuck ""TS FTW""","[3, 7]","Pre released expectations:: Now, I'm expecting this set to be mostly similar to the past 3 other season sets, but different aesthetics. It'll have a slip cover, with Dark Magician Girl on it, with 2 volumes containing 3 discs each in them, each. Each volumes containing relatively 24-25 episodes each. I'll review it more in-depth when I get it next year, but I'm looking forward to it. Cinedigm & 4K Media are really hitting it on the head, with Thor's hammer for releasing these sets now, at such affordable prices & good packaging. Too bad it's not a better dub, with the Japanese language track & subtitles for it, but it's hitting the nostalgia factor really hard, as I mentioned already. Their capitalizing on the nostalgia factor for fans of the original dub & I commend them for it, but let's admit it, it could be a WHOLE LOT better, in hindsight. Whatever you think, I'm still getting this set when it comes out.Post release thoughts: It's DEFINITELY a good release of this version of the show here in America. It's the 1st release of the whole season here in the US. It was only released by FUNi & 4Kids in 3 volumes, with a 4th only being released in Canada, so this is a great way to get the series. The animation is really well produced. It's not HD, or widescreen, as it was produced before the HD switchover for TV shows, but it's up there with Fullmetal Alchemist (1st series) level animation quality, minus the 1 gun edit to a water pistol 4Kids made due to the standards & practices, but everything else looks pretty well produced. It's another filler arc, like the 1st half of season 3, but it's still pretty good. The Seal of Oricalcose arc, to be precise. Also, since Cinedigm hasn't released volume 2 on iTunes yet, for whatever reason, this is currently the only way to watch the whole season, minus maybe some streaming sites online.Now, this release does NOT have the Japanese dialogue, as it's the edited version, but it's still the old show you probably have nostalgia for. Can't wait for season 5, Bonds Beyond Time, & hopefully GX & 5Ds. They haven't made them available for preorder yet, despite an announcement that Cinedigm has signed a deal allowing them to distribute the other series' on DVD & iTunes. Though, they may be waiting on a possible continuation of the dubs for those 2 series by 4K Media, before starting to release them, as those 2 are not currently finished being dubbed because of reasons & I hope that's what they're doing for this future release they've announced. I'm surprised that they haven't made them available, as they've been releasing this series in about 2-month intervals since last year & they've had several of the seasons of this series available for preorder for MONTHS before they were released.Anyways, this is a good release & I'm content with it.",5,The Product Itself (Season 4),1386374400,"12 7, 2013",2013,2818,"['Pre', 'released', 'expectations', 'Now', ""'m"", 'expecting', 'set', 'be', 'mostly', 'similar', 'past', '3', 'other', 'season', 'sets', 'different', 'aesthetics', ""'ll"", 'have', 'slip', 'cover', 'Dark', 'Magician', 'Girl', '2', 'volumes', 'containing', '3', 'discs', 'volumes', 'containing', 'relatively', '24-25', 'episodes', ""'ll"", 'review', 'more', 'in-depth', 'when', 'get', 'next', 'year', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'Cinedigm', '4K', 'Media', 'are', 'really', 'hitting', 'head', 'Thor', 'hammer', 'releasing', 'sets', 'now', 'such', 'affordable', 'prices', 'good', 'packaging', 'Too', 'bad', 'not', 'better', 'dub', 'Japanese', 'language', 'track', 'subtitles', 'hitting', 'nostalgia', 'factor', 'really', 'hard', 'mentioned', 'already', 'capitalizing', 'nostalgia', 'factor', 'fans', 'original', 'dub', 'commend', 'let', 'admit', 'could', 'be', 'WHOLE', 'LOT', 'better', 'hindsight', 'think', ""'m"", 'still', 'getting', 'set', 'when', 'out.Post', 'release', 'thoughts', 'DEFINITELY', 'good', 'release', 'version', 'show', 'here', 'America', '1st', 'release', 'whole', 'season', 'here', 'US', 'was', 'only', 'released', 'FUNi', '4Kids', '3', 'volumes', '4th', 'only', 'being', 'released', 'Canada', 'great', 'way', 'get', 'series', 'animation', 'really', 'well', 'produced', 'not', 'HD', 'widescreen', 'was', 'produced', 'HD', 'switchover', 'TV', 'shows', 'up', 'there', 'Fullmetal', 'Alchemist', '1st', 'series', 'level', 'animation', 'quality', '1', 'gun', 'edit', 'water', 'pistol', '4Kids', 'made', 'due', 'standards', 'practices', 'everything', 'else', 'pretty', 'well', 'produced', 'filler', 'arc', '1st', 'half', 'season', '3', 'still', 'pretty', 'good', 'Seal', 'Oricalcose', 'arc', 'be', 'precise', 'Also', 'Cinedigm', ""n't"", 'released', 'volume', '2', 'iTunes', 'yet', 'reason', 'currently', 'only', 'way', 'watch', 'whole', 'season', 'maybe', 'streaming', 'sites', 'online.Now', 'release', 'NOT', 'have', 'Japanese', 'dialogue', 'edited', 'version', 'still', 'old', 'show', 'probably', 'have', 'nostalgia', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'season', '5', 'Bonds', 'Beyond', 'Time', 'hopefully', 'GX', '5Ds', 'have', ""n't"", 'made', 'available', 'preorder', 'yet', 'announcement', 'Cinedigm', 'signed', 'deal', 'allowing', 'distribute', 'other', 'series', 'DVD', 'iTunes', 'may', 'be', 'waiting', 'possible', 'continuation', 'dubs', '2', 'series', '4K', 'Media', 'starting', 'release', '2', 'are', 'not', 'currently', 'finished', 'being', 'dubbed', 'reasons', 'hope', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'future', 'release', ""'ve"", 'announced', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'have', ""n't"", 'made', 'available', ""'ve"", 'been', 'releasing', 'series', '2-month', 'intervals', 'last', 'year', ""'ve"", 'had', 'several', 'seasons', 'series', 'available', 'preorder', 'MONTHS', 'were', 'released.Anyways', 'good', 'release', ""'m"", 'content']",Yu-Gi-Oh!
