937304,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B000B7QCS6,David Baldwin,"[37, 41]","This film had the misfortune of coming out in the summer of '77 on the heels of ""Smokey and the Bandit"".  Guess which film has more posterity?  I remember seeing this as a kid on a double feature with ""The World's Greatest Lover"" starring Gene Wilder and liked it immensely.  The film's selling point is the car chases but they are secondary to the witty script which was written by William Hjortsberg, author of ""Angel Heart"".  The Florida Everglades are utilized to great effect which adds to film's fantastic ambience.  David Carradine and Kate Jackson have great chemistry and an easy charm that goes down as smoothly as honeydew.  Enjoyable performance by Roger C. Carmel(Mudd from ""Star Trek"") as Ralph Jr., soft drink purveyor who dabbles in toxic moonshine distribution.  Also of note is the presence of Charles Napier, veteran of Jonathan Demme films, as one of Ralph Jr.'s thugs.  Bottom line this movie is Fun! Fun!
