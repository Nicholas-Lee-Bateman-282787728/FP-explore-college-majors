778968,ATYJG42B7J4KJ,B0000DINNH,"Amazon Customer ""LV Mermaid""","[0, 0]",This was my 3rd Bollywood movie and I am totally hooked. The two main characters - Aishwarya Rai and Abhishek Bachchan - have a chemistry that was funny and sexy without the sex which was refreshing! They both are completely entertaining and I thoroughly enjoyed all of the songs in this movie. The story was also kept with the culture of the sanctity of marriage and the injustice to the Indian women if a man chooses to leave. This story has everything needed to an entertaining watch over and over again.

778971,A26A3IVR1CQKFV,B0000DINNH,Constance Thomas,"[0, 0]","This was a very good movie. Starts off a bit slow with the relationship between the two leads, but picks up once Ash (as Namrata) 'helps' him to find a persepctive bride. And of course instead he falls in love with her, not knowing that she's already married with a little boy. He meets the son by chance separately, and loves him as well. I think I liked the realtionship between Raj and the little boy almost more than the romance. The boy (Adi) was a very good actor for someone so young, and it made the story so much more interesting and endearing. It had my husband and I both laughing through the whole first half with all the supporting cast and their wit. As with any Bollywood, there is romance, song and dance, and a weird twist at the end of the film. The song and dances were engaging, and lighthearted. Supporting characters were fun and deep (Raj's family), and the evil villian at the end, is of course the dead beat husband who abandoned her seven years ago-whom you love to hate, and who appears out of the blue demanding his family back, when he has no right to. I could see how this would be seen as a controversial movie in India, as there is almost never divorce, and why it proved such a problem for Ash's character to fall in love with someone new, even with her husband long gone. The highlights for me were when Raj goes to Adi's school as his ""Dad"", and the chemistry between Raj and Ash, especially in the ""video"" scene when he wraps the veil around her. It's easy to see how they came to be together later on in life, as a real married couple with a family of their own now. Raj's character is loving, and brilliant as the ""good guy"". And of course as always Ash is gorgeous, funny, girl next door, and dazzling all at once. Raj's daydreams about Namrata (Ash), and the ending credits with their family in the future were also extremely fun highlights. If you pass on this one, you will be missing a major classic. Going to buy it on DVD now.

778972,AVHY6VOAW1AMY,B0000DINNH,Danielle Sichta,"[5, 5]","This was a beautiful love story.  I cried, laughed, and waited in great suspense. I almost fell in love with Raj myself.  A perfect father, handsome, and a true romantic!  This movie was full of suprises, twist, turns, and had great music!  Aishwarya Rai was great in Bride and Prejudice, but this topped the cake!  She is one of the best bollywood actresses by far.  Adi was also adorable.  The BEST part of the movie is when Adi is at the wedding when Raj tells Namrata's old husband his wish came true, because it was simply for her happiness.  What a hopeless romantic.  Then, the suspense grows as you are hoping so much for Raj to win Namrata over.  Namrata slaps Adi in the face when he does not recognize his real father as his dad, but instead he wants Raj as a dad.  Raj says he should be with his real dad and Adi questions if ""God made a mistake.""  That jackass of a ""husband"" has some of Namrata's and Raj's intimate moments caught on tape.  Sanjeev is a .. i cant say it on [...]!!!  He was a real villian in this movie to me.  The idiot shows his real colors however.  Like all betraying people, karma let him have his!!

778973,A36VA0K8NVUXQD,B0000DINNH,D. C. Sterling,"[1, 1]","This was my first Bollywood movie purchase, and I really liked it. The title song is very cheerful and uplifting, and I find it haunting me because I can't get it out of my head. Of course, this makes me want to play the DVD over and over again. The story is mostly good and very amusing. The song and dance numbers were great, except for one I didn't particularly care for (the one at Adi's school).Some of the storyline was a little ridiculous and over the top, but it made me laugh, so maybe that was its purpose. For instance, in one scene it's raining very hard and both Raj and Namrata get caught in a mudslide. Well, that's one mudslide that looked like a water slide at a theme park, and a lot of fun, so let me try it!Warning! Spoiler coming up!And at the end when the evil husband showed up (so predictable, and dressed in black, of course) I found it astonishing that he just gave Namrata up with a couple of platitudes about how Raj should be a better husband than he had been. It was a huge let-down, like they ran out of time and had to hurriedly wrap up the filming or something. I also think there might be a lot of words being lost in the translation to the English subtitles. It makes me wish I could speak the language.Most of the acting was excellent and believable. Abhishek Bachchan was very charming and believable as Raj and the way Raj would look so longingly at Namrata was heartwrenching. He's also an excellent singer and dancer. On the other hand, sometimes Aishwarya Rai's portrayal as Namrata came across as fake and forced, rather than natural and believable. Her singing and dancing were flawless, though, and of course her eyes would draw you in and you just had to watch her closely.This DVD set came with 2 DVD's, one with the movie and the other with extras. I have to say I had a hard time trying to get the movie itself to play because after you tell it you want English subtitles and then choose to play the movie, what you get is an incredible amount of extremely annoying commercials from Eros. The first time I loaded in the disk, the menu wouldn't even appear, and all I could get was one commercial after another. I still have problems getting to the main menu even though I've watched the movie and the songs several times. This technical difficulty is why I'm giving this movie only 4 stars and not 5. The disk should not be so difficult to work, and the main menu should appear easily and you should not be forced to watch a bunch of commercials. I've never seen so many commercials on a DVD in my life.Overall, I think this is a GREAT Bollywood DVD and I highly recommend it.",4,Great title song--it stays in your head,1262390400,"01 2, 2010",2010,2624,"['was', 'first', 'Bollywood', 'movie', 'purchase', 'really', 'liked', 'title', 'song', 'very', 'cheerful', 'uplifting', 'find', 'haunting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'head', 'course', 'want', 'play', 'DVD', 'over', 'again', 'story', 'mostly', 'good', 'very', 'amusing', 'song', 'dance', 'numbers', 'were', 'great', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'care', 'one', 'Adi', 'school', '.Some', 'storyline', 'was', 'little', 'ridiculous', 'top', 'made', 'laugh', 'so', 'maybe', 'was', 'purpose', 'instance', 'one', 'scene', 'raining', 'very', 'hard', 'Raj', 'Namrata', 'get', 'caught', 'mudslide', 'Well', 'one', 'mudslide', 'looked', 'water', 'slide', 'theme', 'park', 'lot', 'fun', 'so', 'let', 'try', 'Warning', 'Spoiler', 'coming', 'up', 'end', 'when', 'evil', 'husband', 'showed', 'up', 'so', 'predictable', 'dressed', 'black', 'course', 'found', 'astonishing', 'just', 'gave', 'Namrata', 'up', 'couple', 'platitudes', 'how', 'Raj', 'should', 'be', 'better', 'husband', 'had', 'been', 'was', 'huge', 'let-down', 'ran', 'time', 'had', 'hurriedly', 'wrap', 'up', 'filming', 'something', 'also', 'think', 'might', 'be', 'lot', 'words', 'being', 'lost', 'translation', 'English', 'subtitles', 'wish', 'could', 'speak', 'language.Most', 'acting', 'was', 'excellent', 'believable', 'Abhishek', 'Bachchan', 'was', 'very', 'charming', 'believable', 'Raj', 'way', 'Raj', 'would', 'look', 'so', 'longingly', 'Namrata', 'was', 'heartwrenching', 'also', 'excellent', 'singer', 'dancer', 'other', 'hand', 'sometimes', 'Aishwarya', 'Rai', 'portrayal', 'Namrata', 'came', 'fake', 'forced', 'rather', 'natural', 'believable', 'singing', 'dancing', 'were', 'flawless', 'though', 'course', 'eyes', 'would', 'draw', 'just', 'had', 'watch', 'closely.This', 'DVD', 'set', 'came', '2', 'DVD', 'one', 'movie', 'other', 'extras', 'have', 'say', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'trying', 'get', 'movie', 'play', 'because', 'tell', 'want', 'English', 'subtitles', 'then', 'choose', 'play', 'movie', 'what', 'get', 'incredible', 'amount', 'extremely', 'annoying', 'commercials', 'Eros', 'first', 'time', 'loaded', 'disk', 'menu', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'appear', 'could', 'get', 'was', 'one', 'commercial', 'still', 'have', 'problems', 'getting', 'main', 'menu', 'even', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'movie', 'songs', 'several', 'times', 'technical', 'difficulty', 'why', ""'m"", 'giving', 'movie', 'only', '4', 'stars', 'not', '5', 'disk', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'difficult', 'work', 'main', 'menu', 'should', 'appear', 'easily', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'forced', 'watch', 'bunch', 'commercials', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'commercials', 'DVD', 'life.Overall', 'think', 'GREAT', 'Bollywood', 'DVD', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A

I did not think that they had fun and antics and laughter all rolled up in one.But this  movie is just that. It is light-hearted, full of fun, beauty and that serious love commitment they have in India, but it came later. Almost did'nt happen.2 people who had no love in their life, found love, but the girl's husband came back after leaving her and her child for 7 years. He just took off and said nothing.  What he did while he was gone will also get you. She struggled and raised her child by herself. Fell in love in the most unlikely way to a 'finnneee' man and when things seems to be good for both of them...her husband came back on the very day she was to meet her boyfriend's parents.What a mess.  I did not like him, he looked evil and like he was a crook.He was one of those you look at and know right away, 'NOT TO TRUST HIM', HE'S BAD.Now, you will have to see the movie to see all the happenings and how this movie turned out. It will make you angry in some parts, hold your breath in others, and talk back telling him / her...do this, do that.I did not like that her evil husband grabbed her at the engagement party and was pulling her out of the party and no one helped, not even the new love. I said, go help her...but he did not. Don't know if he could not because in India/Hindu you can't interfere with a married couple, even tho estranged. This woman however, broke the ties and restraints put on women in India and made history in her reaction to it.I love, it's clean, no sex, cursing, nudity, or kissing. Close, but no. I think it has something to do with the Hindu/India society laws that 'there is no kissing or sex' until marriage.  I guess?  I was also surprised to see many modern items in their lives; telephone w/voice message and other things you will notice. They are getting very westernized.You'll enjoy this one again.

Kuch Naa Kaho (Say No More) was my second bollywood movie (if you count Bride & Prejudice as full-on bollywood) and I enjoyed it so much I've actually sat through it twice already (to inform the reader, i am a manly man who lives and breathes sports; watching a 2 and half hour flick with sub-titles is a big deal for me, as well as a step up in my social evolution, 'cording to my girl). I'm not saying that I've become a full-on bollywood fan, just an ardent Aishwarya Rai slave.Anyway, the basic plot: Raj lives in America and is tricked into going to India to go to his sister's wedding, suspecting all the while that his matchmaking uncle'll try to marry him off. He meets Namrata (Aishwarya Rai) by a cute coincidence; later, Namrata is talked into guiding/babysitting the reluctant Raj as he dates the five women set up by his uncle; of course, it turns out the perfect chica for him is Namrata; but then there's a little twist...The first two hours mostly pass in comedic fashion, now and then interrupted by song & dance numbers, then it segues into soap opera drama in the final 30-40 minutes. By the way, I just realized I haven't even mentioned the lead actor's name. It is Abhishek Bachchan and, apparently, he is the son of a famous actor (the director, Rohan Sippy, is also the son of a famous director). Abhishek as Raj does a pretty good job. I found myself liking the fella, even though he was romancing the girl of my dreams (I'm sure I have a shot; after all, I am a manly man). Abhishek's sense of humor shines through (check out the ""making of"" on the bonus dvd to see how laid back and cheerful this cat is) but he also holds up well in the dramatic scenes. Some friends more refined than me and who, therefore,  have seen multitudes of foreign films have commented that Kuch Naa Kaho is actually ""a refreshing confection added to the bollywood genre, flavored with up-to-date themes and values and peppered with more modern styles of music."" Me, I just get hungry with that kind of talk. The thing about a lengthy movie like this is that, if you're enjoying it, you fall deeper into the story so that by the end, you're truly wrapped up into the tale and you have a deeper investment in the characters and what befalls them. Now let's go into the movie's not so secret weapon. For that, I'm gonna start a new paragraph.Aishwarya Rai makes this movie work. I'm a layman when it comes to acting; basically, I know what I like. But, to me, Rai has that light, deft touch that is desperately needed with romantic comedies such as this. She is luminously beautiful, yet refreshingly down-to-earth. She makes the musical segments a sheer pleasure to watch. I've replayed the songs so often I could probably describe every dance step and hum every note right now...but I won't.

Four of the song and dance scenes are nicely integrated into the film and go with the flow of the story while one big song and dance number is stand alone.  Part of this dance occurs in a field and Aishwarya Rai is backed up by some dancers that truly rival her beauty - really worth seeing.  During a magical pause you are given the opportunity to compare the beauty of Ash to that of a butterfly.The dance at the school with school children is delightful. Think Benny Hill in the skit where ""F U N E T"" means, ""Have you any tea?"" and ""S V F T"" means ""Yes, we have tea"".  Only, in this song, the sound of letters means Hindi words. Quite a lot of fun - really.  Oh!  Another surprise in the film is that the main family lives in what looks like a Flintstones' mansion.Alright, Abhishek Bachchan (my wife's favorite) is his usual perfect self and Aishwarya Rai (one of my favorites) shows acting range that I had not previously seen from her in other films.

I bought Kuch Naa kaho and four others.I am finding the Indian cinema's take on things refreshing. Aside from exotic music and magical dreamlike atmospheres (which I love),there is something else still alive here. Romance, something the women's movement has managed to strangle to death in America, is stillalive in India. It seems like it's roots are so deeply rooted in the culture that it will be hard to kill it there- at least I hope so.I found the acting to be very good, however there is always the sudden shock of them breaking into song and dance at odd moments. Theystill have a little way to go as far as refinement of smooth transitions with things such as this and as in this movie the sinistertheme music for her villainous returning husband- but all of this can be part of the fun. I am starting to like some of the dance sequences.Over all, I thought this film was well done and will watch it over again. I took of a star for the DVD quality which is not up to par.Also if I adjust it out to fill my wide-screen, the subtitles are off the screen- I have found this to be true on several of these movies.I invite you to leave suggestions for other Bollywood for me to try by leaving a comment on this review- as I am still a novice here.Thanks.",4,1st impressions of Bollywood,1298505600,"02 24, 2011",2011,1367,"['Kuch', 'Naa', 'KahoAs', 'library', 'filling', 'up', 'am', 'running', 'new', 'prospects', 'decided', 'try', 'Bollywood', 'bought', 'Kuch', 'Naa', 'kaho', 'four', 'others.I', 'am', 'finding', 'Indian', 'cinema', 'take', 'things', 'refreshing', 'Aside', 'exotic', 'music', 'magical', 'dreamlike', 'atmospheres', 'love', 'something', 'else', 'still', 'alive', 'here', 'Romance', 'something', 'women', 'movement', 'managed', 'strangle', 'death', 'America', 'stillalive', 'India', 'roots', 'are', 'so', 'deeply', 'rooted', 'culture', 'will', 'be', 'hard', 'kill', 'there-', 'least', 'hope', 'so.I', 'found', 'acting', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'however', 'always', 'sudden', 'shock', 'breaking', 'song', 'dance', 'odd', 'moments', 'Theystill', 'have', 'little', 'way', 'go', 'as', 'far', 'refinement', 'smooth', 'transitions', 'things', 'such', 'movie', 'sinistertheme', 'music', 'villainous', 'returning', 'husband-', 'can', 'be', 'part', 'fun', 'am', 'starting', 'like', 'dance', 'sequences.Over', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'will', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'took', 'star', 'DVD', 'quality', 'not', 'up', 'par.Also', 'adjust', 'fill', 'wide-screen', 'subtitles', 'are', 'screen-', 'have', 'found', 'be', 'true', 'several', 'movies.I', 'invite', 'leave', 'suggestions', 'other', 'Bollywood', 'try', 'leaving', 'comment', 'review-', 'am', 'still', 'novice', 'here.Thanks']",N/A
778989,A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ,B0000DINNH,Sean Pasek,"[3, 3]","If anyone feels that Hollywood has forgotten how to make quality films that are pleasant to watch such as the kind that Hollywood used to put out regularly up until the late 60s, then you can feel assured that Bollywood is picking up the slack.In many ways, this movie reminds me of the films that Doris Day and Rock Hudson put out, like Pillow Talk. Abhishek Bachchan (Raj) has the suave sophistication of a Cary Grant. He plays the role of Raj with charm, class, and sophistication. Aishwarya Rai (Namrata) has the beauty, intelligence, and charm of an Ingrid Bergman. The woman is multi-talented. Rai can act, sing, dance, and speak 3-5 languages fluently. You may think these comparisons are a stretch. Watch this movie and see for yourself. I'm the biggest fan of both Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman, and these two delightful, Bollywood actors, in my opinion for this particular movie, deserve the comparison.When was the last time you found a fun, entertaining film for the whole family that could also inspire? More and more of these little Bollywood gems are coming to light. Most the world is already more than aware of them. It's only here in America that we are still a bit in the dark when it comes to International Cinema.This is a wonderful tale of Raj, who is an Indian man living and working in the United States. The furthest thing from his mind is settling down and getting married. His young cousin is getting married in India. Raj knows better than to attend, because he knows that his Uncle will have a line of potential brides lined up for him a mile long! Nikki, his cousin, brilliantly schemes a way to get him there as she bawls to him on the phone that she needs his help to break up the marriage because she doesn't love the guy. It isn't true, of course, which leads to some hilarious misunderstandings when Raj does go and tries to find an excuse to break up the marriage.In his attempt to get to India as quickly as possible, Raj meets Namrata at the airport. She is also going to India. Little does he realize that she is attending the wedding as well as she is a fashion designer working for Raj's uncle. Raj finds a way to get Namrata to give him her airline ticket by making up an incredible story about his dying son!The fun has only just begun, as Raj's uncle does, indeed, find a way to get Raj to meet eligible women. He decides to send Namrata along to help. The way Raj sabotages his chances with these women is brilliant and downright hiliarious! Obviously, we understand what is coming next: he begins to develop feelings for Namrata, even though she isn't aware of it for a time.This may seem like a typical storyline, but there is a twist to this story that I won't mention in this review for those who haven't seen the film yet.The song and dance numbers are wonderful in this movie. As explained by a popular Bollywood actor, ""A movie without music and dance is like a movie without special effects for westerners.""This movie is just pure, genuine fun. It does, indeed, carry a powerful message about the perception of women, and hopefully, this might serve to influence the Asian belief system about women in many of their societies. What does it mean to be a husband? What does it mean to be a wife? Are they simply titles or should they mean something?Every now and then, I find myself watching the old classic films. The stories and performances had a wonderful charm that I find is sadly lacking in most of today's films. I'm happier now that I can start setting my sights on Bollywood films for the same thing.If these are the kinds of movies you love and enjoy, then you simply can't go wrong with Kuch Naa Kaho. You'll find it to be one of the most wonderful three hours you've spent watching a film in a long time.

AMAZONS COPY OF THE  movie will blur in and out constantly and is basically like you are watching through  broken glasses***********  FRIENDS sold me a perfectly fine copy... From Eros direct per Friends.PLOT.....Simple tale of a scamp of a guy RAJ who's father figure uncle is always trying to marry him off. He gets conned into coming to India by his cousin (uncles daughter) under the guise he is saving her from a forced marriage . His attempts to help her have him lying to a fellow plane passenger to get the last seat on the plane . He makes up a sick child with a heart condition . That pops up a few times (poor,poor babloo) very funny. Ends up the woman he cons for the ticket is the designer of his cousins wedding dress and works for his uncle. Talk about unintended revenge . The way he tries to get his cousin out of her supposed forced, really love , marriage is very funny.  Namarata (Ash) the dress designer is sweet, soft hearted but also strong in a good way. They have a dance off argument at the wedding when she figures out that he was lying to her . She was late and almost didn't get there with the dress!! Very cute music, loved the song keep humming it. Namarata has had to be strong you see because she was abandoned when very young and very pregnant by her cheating skirt and money chasing husband. She had no one and was an orphan (of course) but was employed later by Rajs uncle. He's the one who sends her along to be the chaperone on all of his nephews wacky dates after Raj claims that his relatives cramp his style when he goes to talk to these possible brides. The way he gets rid of these candidates makes me start laughing over and over again like a loon.There are no  big surprises in this film but it does the basics very well indeed.  Raj ends up falling in love with Namarata but is completely floored by the sudden appearance of her son. She's not trying to hide anything from him . He just doesn't know about her life before he meets her at the airport. Over the next two hours he will find out about her past , be a hero to her adorable little scamp of a boy, and be a strong support for Namarata when her life starts to fall apart again.  I bet you can guess what happens next. Yep it's been seven years, evil husband time.  Most educated women in the U.S. are aware of the seven year thing so I'm guessing that its known to the middle class Indian woman or they wouldn't of bothered with it in the movie. I forgive them every contrivance used on his sudden resurgence. The typical hypocritical male thing that goes on in many countries would not be enough to make her situation sympathetic to harsher eyes. They have to go for over the top in some small ways to keep reminding the audience what a stinker he is.  There is  some fine acting and restraint on the part of the  ever evolving Abhischek's (Raj) character, and then Namarata's big self discovery scene. She can let herself try again. She has the courage to not only stop hurting herself in her self perceived failure but to try again at love. Loved her big scene at the end.The filming , songs, costumes , love story are all beautifully done and very compatible with my high def laptop. Could of done without the silly cowgirl outfit at the end of his dream but hey he's a guy so yeah he probably would of. lol. Downstream it then buy it from a real vendor and not amazon's messed up dvdr machine.In the real world, Kudos to the Bachchan's who weren't even dating than. They clearly had chemistry oozing out of every pore and that director knew how to use it to great effect.  Hear they just had a little girl. Bound to be cute when she grows up. If this movie is any indication of future work, in my opinion she should be one rich little girl for eternity. Loved this movie and I bet you will too . Becoming a big fan of both their careers.",5,kuch Naa Kaho,1331251200,"03 9, 2012",2012,4228,"['*****watch', 'downstream', 'version', 'computer', 'problem', 'DO', 'NOT', 'UNDER', 'ANY', 'CIRCUMSTANCES', 'BUY', 'THIS', 'FROM', 'AMAZON', 'DIRECT', 'DVD', 'THEY', 'PRODUCE', 'IT', 'THEMSELVES', 'ON', 'DEMAND', 'WISHED', 'HAD', 'SEEN', 'THAT', 'BEFORE', 'BOUGHT', 'IT', 'TWICE', 'Thought', 'just', 'had', 'bad', 'copy', 'so', 'bought', '.THEY', 'KNOW', 'THE', 'DATA', 'COMPRESSION', 'IS', 'WRONG', 'EVIDENCED', 'BY', 'THE', 'OTHER', 'PEOPLES', 'COMMENTS', 'ON', 'THIS', 'PAGE', 'ALONE', 'AMAZONS', 'COPY', 'THE', 'movie', 'will', 'blur', 'constantly', 'basically', 'are', 'watching', 'broken', 'glasses***********', 'FRIENDS', 'sold', 'perfectly', 'fine', 'copy', 'Eros', 'direct', 'Friends.PLOT', '..Simple', 'tale', 'scamp', 'guy', 'RAJ', 'who', 'father', 'figure', 'uncle', 'always', 'trying', 'marry', 'off', 'conned', 'coming', 'India', 'cousin', 'uncles', 'daughter', 'guise', 'saving', 'forced', 'marriage', 'attempts', 'help', 'have', 'lying', 'fellow', 'plane', 'passenger', 'get', 'last', 'seat', 'plane', 'up', 'sick', 'child', 'heart', 'condition', 'up', 'few', 'times', 'poor', 'poor', 'babloo', 'very', 'funny', 'up', 'woman', 'ticket', 'designer', 'cousins', 'wedding', 'dress', 'uncle', 'Talk', 'unintended', 'revenge', 'way', 'get', 'cousin', 'supposed', 'forced', 'really', 'love', 'marriage', 'very', 'funny', 'Namarata', 'Ash', 'dress', 'designer', 'sweet', 'soft', 'hearted', 'also', 'strong', 'good', 'way', 'have', 'dance', 'argument', 'wedding', 'when', 'out', 'was', 'lying', 'was', 'late', 'almost', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'there', 'dress', 'Very', 'cute', 'music', 'loved', 'song', 'keep', 'humming', 'Namarata', 'had', 'be', 'strong', 'see', 'was', 'abandoned', 'when', 'very', 'young', 'very', 'pregnant', 'cheating', 'skirt', 'money', 'chasing', 'husband', 'had', 'one', 'was', 'orphan', 'course', 'was', 'employed', 'later', 'Rajs', 'uncle', 'one', 'who', 'along', 'be', 'chaperone', 'nephews', 'wacky', 'dates', 'Raj', 'relatives', 'cramp', 'style', 'when', 'talk', 'possible', 'brides', 'way', 'rid', 'candidates', 'start', 'laughing', 'over', 'again', 'are', 'big', 'surprises', 'film', 'basics', 'very', 'well', 'indeed', 'Raj', 'up', 'falling', 'love', 'Namarata', 'completely', 'floored', 'sudden', 'appearance', 'son', 'not', 'trying', 'hide', 'anything', 'just', ""n't"", 'know', 'life', 'airport', 'next', 'two', 'hours', 'will', 'find', 'out', 'past', 'be', 'hero', 'adorable', 'little', 'scamp', 'boy', 'be', 'strong', 'support', 'Namarata', 'when', 'life', 'fall', 'apart', 'again', 'bet', 'can', 'guess', 'what', 'next', 'Yep', 'been', 'seven', 'years', 'evil', 'husband', 'time', 'Most', 'educated', 'women', 'U.S.', 'are', 'aware', 'seven', 'year', 'thing', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'known', 'middle', 'class', 'Indian', 'woman', 'would', ""n't"", 'bothered', 'movie', 'forgive', 'contrivance', 'used', 'sudden', 'resurgence', 'typical', 'hypocritical', 'male', 'thing', 'many', 'countries', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'enough', 'make', 'situation', 'sympathetic', 'harsher', 'eyes', 'have', 'go', 'top', 'small', 'ways', 'keep', 'reminding', 'audience', 'what', 'stinker', 'fine', 'acting', 'restraint', 'part', 'ever', 'evolving', 'Abhischek', 'Raj', 'character', 'then', 'Namarata', 'big', 'self', 'discovery', 'scene', 'can', 'let', 'try', 'again', 'courage', 'not', 'only', 'stop', 'hurting', 'self', 'perceived', 'failure', 'try', 'again', 'love', 'Loved', 'big', 'scene', 'end.The', 'filming', 'songs', 'costumes', 'love', 'story', 'are', 'beautifully', 'done', 'very', 'compatible', 'high', 'def', 'laptop', 'Could', 'done', 'silly', 'cowgirl', 'outfit', 'end', 'dream', 'hey', 'guy', 'so', 'yeah', 'probably', 'would', 'lol', 'Downstream', 'then', 'buy', 'real', 'vendor', 'not', 'amazon', 'messed', 'up', 'dvdr', 'real', 'world', 'Kudos', 'Bachchan', 'who', 'were', ""n't"", 'even', 'dating', 'clearly', 'had', 'chemistry', 'oozing', 'pore', 'director', 'knew', 'how', 'use', 'great', 'effect', 'Hear', 'just', 'had', 'little', 'girl', 'Bound', 'be', 'cute', 'when', 'up', 'movie', 'indication', 'future', 'work', 'opinion', 'should', 'be', 'one', 'rich', 'little', 'girl', 'eternity', 'Loved', 'movie', 'bet', 'will', 'too', 'Becoming', 'big', 'fan', 'careers']",N/A
778992,AUQAL4MV2CM2R,B0000DINNH,"Warp Girl ""warpgirl""","[1, 1]","Okay I bet you all thought I couldn't buy anything without a certain someone eh! Well, the very witty and wonderful reviewer Mr. H. Bala told me this is the one Aishwarya Rai film he couldn't live without. So how could I skip it? Mrs. Rai-Bachchan is my favorite of all of Bollywood's actresses, I'm slightly less enamored with Abhishek Bachachan as a rule, but I happen to be quite surprised with him here. I didn't know that he could ditch his monotone when he acts! Don't get me wrong, he's plenty charismatic in interviews but I guess I just picked some movies where he just couldn't let loose. My first AB experience wasDhoom 2: Bollywood Movieand in all fairness he got overshadowed. But I'm a fair and open-minded girl, and I didn't want to admit to being shallow either so I quickly started watching other films. I desperately hoped the lack-luster, 'Why does he seem like he's sleep walking?' feelings to go away! I mean this guy has got acting in the DNA. Okay fine, MOST of Bollywood is a complex web of DNA, but that's what's great about it. Well, for me it is. Anyway, Mr. AB Jr. has got some of the most talented DNA in the world. So, I triedJhoom barabar jhoom(flat)Bunty Aur Babli(Ms. Mukjeri had his back, not to mention dad and the lovely Miss Rai)Dhoom Bollywood DVD With English Subtitles(Okay...) but the absolute worst of these disappointments has to beRefugee (2000) (Hindi Film / Bollywood Movie / Indian Cinema DVD)(save yourself the pain and cash!) So it was with some apprehension that I spend my gift card on an actor that has disappointed me so often.However, while I still don't put Mr. AB Jr. in the class of truly great actors where I can only focus on the character, he's finally convinced me that when properly motivated he can bring some life to the screen! He still has flat moments, and his emotions don't reach his eyes on camera, but I have hope, and I don't regret spending the gift card money.Okay, the four stars is for Mrs. Rai Bachchan. What? I said I'm warming up to the man, not that I'm a fan or anything! I believe she is one of the few beautiful women I've ever seen that is able to genuinely convey she doesn't have a clue! Heck, even some actresses who have nothing to crow over are so conscious of their looks that they make the audience aware of them too. No such thing with Mrs. Rai Bachchan, granted the media and the cameraman won't let you forget that she's beautiful, but I respect her for not strutting. If anyone has just cause it's her.Poor thing, this must've been a tough movie to shoot. Not a great time in her life thanks to someone who's first name begins with S and ends with N. UG! But all's well that ends well, and a movie hero eventually turned into a real life one. You know, I don't feel any sincere romantic fireworks watching this, but since they're aren't any firing in real life at this time, it's not too surprising. I will say she's great at generating the film sparks and she effortlessly runs through a gauntlet of extreme emotions without faltering one step. She kept me engaged in the story.Now you know the drill by now, first up... Production: I really thought the opening credits were cute! I know that they're nothing special by Western Standards but I've never seen them done like that in Bollywood. According to the box, this was Mr. Sippy's (and how utterly AWESOME is that name) first time directing. I have to say all-in-all not a bad debut. Yes there were things that made me role my eyes, the waterslide (not kidding it's an actual waterslide, I used to work at a waterpark!) the sound effects, that suddenly stopped, (not that I wanted them to continue) and he let things drag out in order to build suspense too long. Using a technique once or twice in a scene is perfectly acceptable, but when I lose count of the same technique in ONE scene my patience runs out! Drop the bomb or just let it be! Obviously, there are polishing issues.Visually, I'd say that things were quite good, although the uncle's house was hideous! Ick never ever would I do that to my house! The costumes were mostly up-to-date (although someone should have had a word with the costume designer about a truly heinous pair of black sandals! Hello! Shoes are the most important part of a sexy party outfit. I have to say the makeup wasn't horrible like I've gotten used to in Bollywood movies during this period. Yes, they cake it on to Mrs. Rai Bachchan but you just can't ruin that face. Thankfully, they go easy on the other women and they look lovely. Well, all except the school teacher...Songs and Dances: I'm just gonna say it, Mr. AB Jr. is not now, nor will ever be a dancer. That's fine, not everyone has to be a dancer. But for the first time I saw him actually look like he enjoyed one or two of them! YEY! I always say, if you're not a dancer, make it look like you're having a blast and nobody will care. Mrs. Rai Bachchan she IS a dancer, and I feel utterly wasted here. I just know the argument coming with my mom when we watch it together, ""Honey I have yet to see this woman really dance. Me: Don't blame the dancer blame the choreographer! You won't watch Guzaarish! I saw it, she can't do air guitar either. Me: Oh Ammmi shut up and watch the movie!"" Sad to say it'll go down EXACTLY like that! Lovely people and fellow Aishwarya Rai Bachchan fans, help a girl out and give me a list of her best dance films. Otherwise I'm fighting a losing Bollywood battle here and I HATE to lose a debate!Now for music. Well, the trio of Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy have had at it again. The love songs were nice, but I couldn't help but feel that the score just didn't have enough of that amazing Bollywoodness for the type of movie it was. It felt almost too polished and western, or maybe it's just that it lacked warmth to me. The only song that truly sticks with me is the theme song.Special shout outs: ADORABLE KID ALERT! Parth Dave, OMG There is nothing about this kid that wasn't AWESOME! I wanted him on the screen all the time and he kept reminding me of a certain someone... (whom I will not name!) but lo and behold I finally figured out why he did remind me of that certain someone...Jodhaa Akbar (Three-Disc Collector's Edition)three guesses who he plays in that movie! (Okay he plays a younger version of the hero) LOL It seems even when I take drastic action to curb my raving fangirlishness about a certain someone he's never too far away! LOL Oh well, nobody can say I didn't try!Awkward Alert: Remember how I said that a certain man whose given name begins with S and ends with N was making trouble for our heroine in real life? His younger brother played the villain in this movie. Jeeze, I hope everyone got paid extra on those days at work. On the other hand, Mr. Khan was quite menacing, I hope that means he was just into the role.I wish I didn't so actively try to avoid spoilers in these things. Otherwise I'd write some plot observations, but I do so I won't. Bottom line, THANKS FOR THE RECOMMENDATION Mr. H. Bala! I doubt I'll ever be a fully-fledged fan of the Jr. Bachchan but his wife can pull me into anything!",4,WOW!

This was my first bollywood movie ever, I have yet to see even Bride & Prejudice. It wasn't nearly as over the top as people told me it would be. I enjoyed Raj's antics, even though his incredible, pathetic, story about how he needed that last seat on the plane because his son Babloo was sick from a heart attack had me rolling my eyes with a groan. I was outright laughing in the school scene when Raj lived up to Adi's boasting and jumped from the roof of the school and then had to kick a soccer ball back up onto the roof. It's a good thing for Namrata that Raj really did love her, because she was so stupid sometimes and stubborn that many a man would have walked away.
