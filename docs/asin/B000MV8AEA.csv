I quite like Lifetime movies and enjoy watching them,so this one did not disappoint.Tracy does a really good job at playing Alice.  I thought she acted very well.  Barbara Niven was great as usual.The only thing that I thought was disappointing was that the movie ended too abruptly.  I would have liked to see a more suspenseful fight scene or a longer confrontation between the 2 characters to make the ending more satisfying.But I enjoyed it and I thought that it was a good movie.",4,I liked the movie....,1358294400,"01 16, 2013",2013,542,"['saw', 'movie', 'last', 'night', 'buying', 'Amazon', 'quite', 'Lifetime', 'movies', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'so', 'one', 'did', 'not', 'disappoint.Tracy', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'playing', 'Alice', 'thought', 'acted', 'very', 'well', 'Barbara', 'Niven', 'was', 'great', 'usual.The', 'only', 'thing', 'thought', 'was', 'disappointing', 'was', 'movie', 'ended', 'too', 'abruptly', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'more', 'suspenseful', 'fight', 'scene', 'longer', 'confrontation', '2', 'characters', 'make', 'ending', 'more', 'satisfying.But', 'enjoyed', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'movie']","Rival, The"

This one is horrendous...horrible acting...no script...totally boring...moves at a snail's pace...and should be avoided at all cost.  The box cover art is also a rip-off.  There's no such scene in the film.  Tracy Nelson's performance is less than inspiring.  She's in the wrong field.  She should be a clerk at the DMV.  Even if someone gives you this film free of charge, refuse it.  You could do much better watching TV commercials for 93 minutes.  No kidding.  This one belongs in the trash...which is where I placed it less than 30 seconds after I retrieved it from my DVD player.",1,AVOID AT ALL COST,1281830400,"08 15, 2010",2010,657,"['paid', '29', 'cents', 'film', 'used', 'feel', 'completely', 'ripped', 'off', 'one', 'horrendous', 'horrible', 'acting', 'script', 'totally', 'boring', 'moves', 'snail', 'pace', 'should', 'be', 'avoided', 'cost', 'box', 'cover', 'art', 'also', 'rip-off', 'such', 'scene', 'film', 'Tracy', 'Nelson', 'performance', 'less', 'inspiring', 'wrong', 'field', 'should', 'be', 'clerk', 'DMV', 'Even', 'someone', 'film', 'free', 'charge', 'refuse', 'could', 'do', 'much', 'better', 'watching', 'TV', 'commercials', '93', 'minutes', 'kidding', 'one', 'belongs', 'trash', 'where', 'placed', 'less', '30', 'seconds', 'retrieved', 'DVD', 'player']","Rival, The"

Driven by the desire to be a mother, she focuses on rebuilding her life with the help of a therapist and her new husband, George, the man of her dreams.Obsessed with motherhood, Alice and George find Jennifer, a beautiful young surrogate who agrees to live with them during the pregnancy. That's when everything begins to change. Alice becomes enraged with jealousy and finds herself consumed with the fear that George may leave her for the surrogate.As Alice is pulled to the edge of insanity, the secrets of her horrific past rear their ugly heads and Alice is forced to extremes to hold on to the one thing she's wanted - the baby - even if it means murdering anyone who gets in her way.",4,Deadly Obsession,1390780800,"01 27, 2014",2014,853,"['When', 'Alice', 'deeply', 'disturbed', 'woman', 'dark', 'past', 'shot', 'robbery', 'only', 'thing', 'ever', 'really', 'wanted', 'baby', 'womb', 'Driven', 'desire', 'be', 'mother', 'rebuilding', 'life', 'help', 'therapist', 'new', 'husband', 'George', 'man', 'dreams.Obsessed', 'motherhood', 'Alice', 'George', 'find', 'Jennifer', 'beautiful', 'young', 'surrogate', 'who', 'live', 'pregnancy', 'when', 'everything', 'change', 'Alice', 'enraged', 'jealousy', 'consumed', 'fear', 'George', 'may', 'leave', 'surrogate.As', 'Alice', 'pulled', 'edge', 'insanity', 'secrets', 'horrific', 'rear', 'ugly', 'heads', 'Alice', 'forced', 'extremes', 'hold', 'one', 'thing', 'wanted', 'baby', 'even', 'murdering', 'anyone', 'who', 'way']","Rival, The"
