Miller,"[0, 0]","The Croods [2013] [Deluxe Edition] [Blu-ray 3D / Blu-ray / DVD + Digital Copy] Join the first modern family as they embark on the journey of a lifetime across a spectacular and unforgettable landscape. When their cave is destroyed, everything the Croods have ever known is rocked by seismic shifts and generational clashes as they discover an incredible new world filled with fantastic creatures - and their world is changed forever. If they don&#8217;t evolve, they&#8217;ll be history!Voice Cast: Nicolas Cage, Emma Stone, Ryan Reynolds, Catherine Keener, Clark Duke, Cloris Leachman, Chris Sanders and Randy ThomDirectors: Chris Sanders and Kirk De MiccoProducers: Jane Hartwell and Kristine BelsonScreenplay: Chris Sanders and Kirk DeMiccoComposer: Alan SilvestriCinematography: Yong Duk Jhun and Roger Deakins [Visual Consultant]Resolution: 1080pAspect Ratio: 2.35:1Audio: English: 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, Spanish: 5.1 Dolby Digital, French: 5.1 Dolby Digital, Russian: 5.1 DTS, Estonian: 5.1 Dolby Digital, Latvian: 5.1 Dolby Digital, Lithuanian: 5.1 Dolby Digital and Ukrainian: 5.1 Dolby DigitalSubtitles: English SDH, French, Spanish, Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Russian and UkrainianRunning Time: 96 minutesRegion: Region A/1Number of discs: 3Studio: DreamWorks AnimationAndrew&#8217;s Blu-ray review &#8211; DreamWorks is the definition of a hit-or-miss animation studio. 'Rise of the Guardians' was superb in both substance and style, especially likes of 'Puss in Boots' [that I thought was awesome], whereas 'Madagascar 3' and their most recent dreadful animation 'Turbo' have all been definitely thumbs down, big time.At some point all the CGI children&#8217;s films that come out nowadays sort of blend together. The occasional release stands out, it's usually a PIXAR production, but even that's an iffy prospect these days, but mostly it feels like a whole lot of sameness. Most of them are colourful, have simple plots, and have a few funny moments. In other words, they work perfectly fine as electronic babysitters.We're in prehistoric times and the Croods are a loveable family of Neanderthals trying to do what every Neanderthal is trying to do, not get killed. It's a dangerous world out there, so the Croods tend to stay inside their cave cowering in fear. As Grug Crood [Nicolas Cage], papa caveman of this clan, always says, &#34;Never not be afraid.&#34;The Croods family is taught that curiosity is just about the most dangerous thing a caveman can have, so of course their daughter Eep [Emma Stone] is naturally curious. A good old strained father-daughter relationship is brewing here. But, the movie wouldn't be complete without a few comedic generic characters like the sassy grandmother [Cloris Leachman], the doltish son [Clark Duke], the congenial mother (Catherine Keener), the wacky baby, and the loveable stranger [Ryan Reynolds]. Now that they've got the formula down it's time to run the characters through the predictable paces, picking up a few zany animal friends along the way.So, now you know what you're in for. As far as a children&#8217;s film goes, there's much worse out there than 'The Croods.' At least the animation is stunningly brilliant to look at. No matter that none of the animals featured appear to have come from this planet since not one of them appears to fit into the evolutionary chain at all. Giant flying turtles, land whales with stubby legs walking around in the desert, and leafy elephants just to name a few of the stranger creations in this film.At some point you just have to say, &#34;Hey, if it makes Junior happy, I'm in.&#34; As far as competing with the strongest entries in the DreamWorks catalogue, 'The Croods' is great. The hardnosed father is taught a lesson by his spunky young daughter in acceptance and living life to the fullest. In turn, she discovers that maybe her dad really does care about her and all that paranoid parenting actually meant something.That said, there's some really fun animation in this film. It's as if they said, screw the geological record, we're making our own evolutionary creations. Because of the inventiveness of the world of 'The Croods' and the creativity applied in the animation, the movie rises above the other formulaic children&#8217;s films. Not by much, but enough that it stands out among the rest.Blu-ray Video Quality &#8211; The Croods looks absolutely stunning in 3D and there's nearly no difference in brightness or definition between this version and the stand alone 2D image (also included in this set). Colours are just as bold, details are just as fine. The image never appears any darker in 3D, which is a plus, particularly in the film's naturally darker scenes. Details still look incredible, right down to the finest terrain textures, whether gritty earthen elements or lush natural vegetation.The 3D effects are brilliant. General depth impresses me greatly. The transfer shows off the sprawling landscapes really good, again both the rocky lands to start and the more colourful vegetation areas later. Shots down on the ground are particularly impressive in terms of realistic spacing and depth. A few odds and ends do stand out; animal beaks and noses sometimes seem to extended beyond the front of the screen, while dust particles and other floating objects on the air seems to drift far back into and well out of the screen. Very little of the dreaded &#34;crosstalk&#34; effect was visible throughout the film. Overall, this is a brilliant 3D transfer.Blu-ray Audio Quality &#8211; Provided with a 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio mix, 'The Croods' matches the exceptionality of its video presentation with its audio. This is an immersive, entertaining audio mix that sucks you in and never lets you go.There are plenty of examples where the movie's sound design makes great use of the seven channels. The opening chase scene where the Croods attempt to procure breakfast by stealing an egg, uses every channel in its arsenal. The action zooms from one speaker to another. The sound travels flawlessly back and forth through the sound field. There are other moments, like when the earth starts cracking up, where the surround takes hold, providing deep, rumbling bass. Explosions of lava and smoke erupt from the earth's surface, causing the sub-woofer to roar.The rear channels are equally impressive. The soundscape of 'The Croods' prehistoric world is a lively one.

It's a very sweet and touching experience amidst all of the humour, most of which hits and none of which falls completely flat. To be sure, there's not much room to reinvent the wheel, in this case, being the modern Family animated film, but there's something to be said for sprucing it up and getting the most out of its capabilities, which The Croods does very well. The DreamWorks Animation Blu-ray 3D release of The Croods delivers an awesome 2D picture as well. The 3D transfer and the amazing sound are a brilliant factor to purchase this 3D extravaganza. A very nice array of extras are included, and the animation is sure to leave audiences of all ages extremely satisfied and all in all I was so happy to get this brilliant 3D package and has gone pride of place in my Blu-ray 3D Collection.

1646959,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00CHVIAS4,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","`The Croods' tells a primitive story (in more than one sense) or a family of cavemen who are thrust from the normality of their lives (and by normal, I mean abnormal routine) into a world of the unknown when their cave is destroyed during `The End'.  The family consists of a caring mother, a dopey son, a savage baby daughter, a gross grandmother, a curious teenage girl name Eep and an overprotective father, Grug.  We are introduced to the family as they hunt for food (in the most comical of manners) and are rushed back into their cave, where they spend most of their days and nights, by the threat of anything new.  When Eep ventures off one night and meets another human, the family's life is forever changed and they begin to `live'.As a whole, I rather enjoyed this.  It was pretty funny from start to finish, which is a plus with child centered animated films.  One thing that my daughter mentioned, and that I thought was pretty interesting, was that there is no villain here.  I really enjoyed this aspect of the film.  I'm so tired of these animated films with vicious enemies who fight against good until the death.  Why are we teaching these kinds of things to our children?  Breaking the mold, `The Croods' has the elements (and some wildlife) as the only enemy and eventually uses those very things for good.  Even Grug's constant rambling about certain death is played up for laughs.  The development of character is a tad formulaic and yet it really works as a whole.I do take issue with some lazy aspects of the film.  The stereotyping of the caveman himself was somewhat lazy, especially when you have this massive caveman who, as he points out, eats maybe a drip of egg a week.  He should have been skrawney and malnourished but he was unbelievably strong and quite fat.  The treatment of days was also kind of bizarre.  The family would wake up and find and egg and next thing you know it is nighttime and they are racing to hide from some kind of predator.  The conceptualized prehistoric era was fun, if not a tad `Avatar' like, and it certainly popped, so that was nice.In the end I give it a B-.  My family enjoyed this.

I think the funniest scene was where the tiger blows out the torch, then when the earth starts shaking again, both the dad and the tiger are frantically blowing on the touch to light it again. There are other hilarious parts in the movie as well that I think make it memorable, such as when the grandma is ferociously eating the meat, and it overall has its really funny scenes after the Croods leave the cave.

Who do we cast?""  At some point, someone suggested Nicholas Cage.  There's a joke here, but it's so obvious I'm not going to bother making it.In all fairness to Cage, his brand of overacting is perfectly suited to this cartoon.  The Croods problems lie with the film itself - it's simply boring.  Despite some amazing animation, and a talented group of voice actors, it meanders as purposelessly as the Cro-Magnon's in the starring roles.The Croods are the last cavemen in their world, surviving only by following their credo, ""Never try anything new"", the irony of which seems to be lost on Hollywood.  By day, they attempt to scrounge food up from whatever source they can, and hide in their cave by night.  Eep, played by the talented Emma Stone, is sick of this lifestyle, and sneaks out at night, meeting the intelligent human Guy.  Guy plans on high-tailing it out of the gorge, as the world is evidently ending, rather spectacularly and for no particular reason.While father figure Grug (played by Cage) is initially against the idea of escape, a couple landslides is enough to change his mind.  According to Guy, a distant mountain represents safety from the impending volcano-landslide-flood apocalypse, so he and the family set off in that direction, with a jungle full of weird creatures the only thing in between them and survival.  The creature design is competent, but often seems a bit too garish compared to the often stark beauty of the prehistoric world's landscapes.  If Jurassic Park has starred large cartoon chickens instead of dinosaurs, it would have quite closely resembled The Croods.Unlike other movies of its persuasion - Ice Age comes to mind - The Croods resembles more of a series of vignettes than an actual plot.  The invention of shoes, an encounter with swarms of birds that eat like piranha, tar pits - it's all there, but not much of it really ends up mattering.  It's a loud movie rather than a truly funny one, which makes it clear the young audience it's targeting.  If you're older than 8, The Croods is not for you.

1647014,A3KZLC8UFCQ8NU,B00CHVIAS4,cherryblueberry,"[2, 4]","In DreamWorks ""The Croods"" a prehistoric family embarks on the very first road trip ever!  After their cave is destroyed, they must go in search of a new home - with the help of a handsome stranger named Guy.Who are The Croods?  They are Dreamwork's rendition of a caveman family - the father, Grug, is always warning his family about the dangers outside.  He wants to keep his family safe - ""in the dark.""Grug has a wife and a restless teenage daughter named Eep - there is also a not-too-bright overweight son, a strange growling baby, and a crusty grandma character.  Then along comes Guy - a handsome stranger (with a cute pet named Belt) who lives for adventure and ""following the sun.""  Eep is in love.  Grug is none too thrilled.Guy leads the Crood family through a very colorful prehistoric CG landscape filled with all sorts of neon bright fanciful and furry critters that happen to have very large teeth.  Adventures ensues - despite the fact Grug is completely against them ensuing.  Will the family find a new home?  Or will they get eaten up by one of the many weird surrealistic creatures?  Will Grug and Guy ever get along?  After all, Guy is so different.  He uses his brain and comes up with brand new ideas.  Grug believes in just relying on his brawn.  Well, to find the answers to these questions, you'll just have to watch the movie and see.The visuals in this movie are fantastic.  Lots of interesting and colorful ""eye candy"" to keep little kids transfixed.  However.....and it's a BIG however...I feel the story leaves a bit to be desired - from an adult standpoint.  Like I said, little kids will no doubt love it.  But the plot is just so clich&eacute; and typical....the humor is so lazy and un-clever it makes you want to yawn (think:  Hotel Transylvania).  I think I chuckled twice during the whole film - and I thought it was going to be an outrageous comedy!!!  Not so.  The Croods is not clever and sophisticated like the Shrek movies.  It is even less sophisticated than the Ice Age movies, in my opinion.The characters are not very unique - you never really warm up to any of them, like you do with Shrek or Donkey or even Sid the Sloth.  Eep as the teenage daughter is so woefully predictable.  And what's with the weird hourglass figure and overly shapely legs?  Is that really necessary for a kid's movie?Certain comments Grug makes about ""killing the grandma"" struck me as disturbing.  I know it's just supposed to be comedy, but still...The thing that bothered me the most about the movie, is that it literally hits you over the head with too much sappy family ""I love you's""....it seemed forced.Overall, I wasn't thrilled with the movie - as you can probably tell!  I recommend you see it once - just for the visuals...but maybe rent before buying.  Unless you have a child under 10 - then go ahead and purchase the movie.

The Croods is the most visually stunning animated feature I think I have ever seen, and the 3D was equally superb, so 5 stars on that front. The voice-actors were very good as well and deserve to be recognized for their work. It was the writing behind the movie that left me bored and uninspired. Sort of like the Ice-Age series, The Croods is the story of a journey to a safe zone after the family of cavemen's ""natural habitat"" becomes unstable due to out-to-get-you seismic activity. Always with the earthquakes. However, unlike the Ice-Age franchise, The Croods lacked entertaining, plot-helping side stories. It's the family's journey and some pride issues with the clan's father figure (voiced by Nicholas Cage). That's pretty much it. Predictable. Yawn.However, if you are primarily interested in this movie for your kids, I think it deserves at least 4 stars. There's plenty visual excitement and cuteness for younger viewers to enjoy, and there's no inappropriate humor or innuendo. There were a crew of 3 little kids in front of us at the theatre, I'd guess between ages 3-6, and they were mostly spell-bound for the entire motion picture. That says something good for a kids' movie.Thanks for reading.-CL",3,"Great Visuals and Voice Acting, Weak Plot",1363996800,"03 23, 2013",2013,1274,"['wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'spoilers', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'Croods', 'most', 'visually', 'stunning', 'animated', 'feature', 'think', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', '3D', 'was', 'equally', 'superb', 'so', '5', 'stars', 'front', 'voice-actors', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'well', 'deserve', 'be', 'recognized', 'work', 'was', 'writing', 'movie', 'left', 'bored', 'uninspired', 'Sort', 'Ice-Age', 'series', 'Croods', 'story', 'journey', 'safe', 'zone', 'family', 'cavemen', 'natural', 'habitat', 'unstable', 'due', 'out-to-get-you', 'seismic', 'activity', 'Always', 'earthquakes', 'However', 'Ice-Age', 'franchise', 'Croods', 'lacked', 'entertaining', 'plot-helping', 'side', 'stories', 'family', 'journey', 'pride', 'issues', 'clan', 'father', 'figure', 'voiced', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'pretty', 'much', 'Predictable', 'Yawn.However', 'are', 'primarily', 'interested', 'movie', 'kids', 'think', 'least', '4', 'stars', 'plenty', 'visual', 'excitement', 'cuteness', 'younger', 'viewers', 'enjoy', 'inappropriate', 'humor', 'innuendo', 'were', 'crew', '3', 'little', 'kids', 'front', 'theatre', ""'d"", 'guess', 'ages', '3-6', 'were', 'mostly', 'spell-bound', 'entire', 'motion', 'picture', 'something', 'good', 'kids', 'movie.Thanks', 'reading.-CL']",N/A

1647059,A4TVX5141Y2TG,B00CHVIAS4,"Douglas Groothuis ""Douglas Groothuis""","[0, 0]","The film, &#34;The Croods,&#34; is based on the general assumption that humans evolved from sub-human creatures. This is the humorous story of their ascent. While I don't accept this Darwinian explanation of man, the film is worth seeing for several reasons.First, the computer animation is stunning (at least to me). The characters' expressions and gestures, the landscapes, and the animals (all hybrids of known animals) are so far from the animation that I saw as a child that it seems to come from another civilization. (Maybe it does.)Second, while the films assumes a naturalist view of the world, it undermines itself wonderfully. The Crood family begin as fear-based pre-humans (or semi-humans) whose only goal is not to die. But their teenage daughter wants more. She wants to live and be curious. By meeting a more evolved character, the Croods begin to think about &#34;tomorrow&#34; and end up &#34;following the light.&#34;It is all delightfully done, mind you--the hyper-slapstick and constant verbal and physical humor can be nearly hysterical. But it does not fit Darwinism, which allows for no transcendence of the material world. The Croods, you, see begin to act beyond instinct and conditioning. They dream; they explore; they hope. They are not merely evolved animals.Thus, the human essence, made in God's image and likeness, shines through even this supposedly Darwinian tale, which makes it even better. This also chimes in with a New York Times article which recently related that an atheist group was holding &#34;services&#34; and wanted more of a sense of &#34;transcendence.&#34;",4,Clever and More,1400371200,"05 18, 2014",2014,1608,"['film', '34', 'Croods', '34', 'based', 'general', 'assumption', 'humans', 'evolved', 'sub-human', 'creatures', 'humorous', 'story', 'ascent', 'do', ""n't"", 'accept', 'Darwinian', 'explanation', 'man', 'film', 'worth', 'seeing', 'several', 'reasons.First', 'computer', 'animation', 'stunning', 'least', 'characters', 'expressions', 'gestures', 'landscapes', 'animals', 'hybrids', 'known', 'animals', 'are', 'so', 'far', 'animation', 'saw', 'child', 'come', 'civilization', 'Maybe', 'Second', 'films', 'naturalist', 'view', 'world', 'wonderfully', 'Crood', 'family', 'begin', 'fear-based', 'pre-humans', 'semi-humans', 'only', 'goal', 'not', 'die', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'more', 'live', 'be', 'curious', 'meeting', 'more', 'evolved', 'character', 'Croods', 'begin', 'think', '34', 'tomorrow', '34', 'end', 'up', '34', 'following', 'light.', '34', 'delightfully', 'done', 'mind', 'hyper-slapstick', 'constant', 'verbal', 'physical', 'humor', 'can', 'be', 'nearly', 'hysterical', 'not', 'fit', 'Darwinism', 'transcendence', 'material', 'world', 'Croods', 'see', 'begin', 'act', 'instinct', 'conditioning', 'dream', 'explore', 'hope', 'are', 'not', 'merely', 'evolved', 'animals.Thus', 'human', 'essence', 'made', 'God', 'image', 'likeness', 'shines', 'even', 'supposedly', 'Darwinian', 'tale', 'even', 'better', 'also', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'article', 'recently', 'related', 'atheist', 'group', 'was', 'holding', '34', 'services', '34', 'wanted', 'more', 'sense', '34', 'transcendence.', '34']",N/A

1647082,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00CHVIAS4,FNDNreview,"[3, 9]","It seems like the animated films of yesterday were so much more tame compared to the animated films of today.  Yes, this a reference to the violence used in animated films, which typically goes overlooked and receives a free pass - because it's animated.  Apparently, animated violence must not translate the same way as authentic, realistic violence - because violence, whether it's slapstick or not, is clearly visible in the majority of modern animated films.  For instance, when one of the minions playfully hits one of his workmates in Despicable Me, it makes for a good laugh.  If you watch the teaser trailer for Despicable Me 2 (coming this summer), you'll notice one good punch at the end - and it's funny.  It's funny to adults, so children will find it equally as funny, but it's not exactly the proper message to be sending impressionable children.  DreamWorks' newest film, The Croods, also depicts much of the same playful, slapstick violence.The Croods is the story about a family of cavemen living their lives constantly in fear of anything outside of their home - a cave.  Eep Crood (Emma Stone), the oldest of the Crood children, is in her adolescence and at an age where she wants to explore outside the safety zone of her family's cave.  However, her father, Grug (Nicholas Cage) is the fearful leader of the family that believes nothing outside of the cave is safe, and everything leads to death.  One night, Eep meets Guy (Ryan Reynolds) - an adolescent boy (roughly her same age) that tells her the end of the world is upon them and they should be preparing for it.  True enough, a series of unexplained earthquakes destroy the family's cave, forcing the entire family on the run - thrusting them on an adventure to find paradise, which they believe is called, ""tomorrow.""  Catherine Kenner, Clark Duke, and Cloris Leachman also provide voices for the film.Much like an Ice Age film, The Croods begins with a less than humorous chase scene in which the family is trying to steal an egg from some turkey/flamingo creature (as a source of food).  It's instantly reminiscent of an all too familiar squirrel that works tirelessly to recover his nut, only to be constantly thwarted by various coincidental interruptions.  Several similar occurrences take place throughout the film, providing for only a few outstanding moments of humor - one of which includes The Crood's first interaction with fire, where essentially everything in sight ends up being lit on fire.In the character development department, there are very few traits about these characters that haven't been established in other animated films.  Clearly, this is a film about family, featuring the father vs. daughter dynamic, not to mention the father dealing with losing her daughter to a male suitor.  As far as the supporting cast goes, they serve as nothing more than family clich&eacute;s - including the irritating mother-in-law, a moronic fat son, and a baby that acts like the family dog.  And, while there are moments where these characters provide a few laughs (mostly via the previously mentioned slapstick violence), there's still very little that's memorable about them.Early on, the film establishes itself as a theme driven film - depicting The Croods as fearful humans that lack any sensible knowledge about the world around them.  As the film progresses, the father and daughter clash about the nature of living life - with Eep arguing there has to be more to life than living a life filled with fear, hidden away in a cave, while Grug believes there shouldn't be a moment that doesn't include fear.  Over the course of the film, Grug becomes more of the focal point, since he is the one that has to learn to fight his fears, take chances in life, and accept certain risks.Overall, The Croods is your average animated film, yet severely lacks memorability.  Nevertheless, the animation is sharp, colorful, and eye-pleasing, and easily contains enough light-heated adventure to sustain the attention of most children.Overall Film Grade:  C-FNDNreview.com",3,Caveman family faces evolution in 'The Croods',1363910400,"03 22, 2013",2013,4054,"['animated', 'films', 'yesterday', 'were', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'tame', 'compared', 'animated', 'films', 'today', 'Yes', 'reference', 'violence', 'used', 'animated', 'films', 'typically', 'overlooked', 'free', 'pass', 'animated', 'Apparently', 'animated', 'violence', 'must', 'not', 'translate', 'same', 'way', 'authentic', 'realistic', 'violence', 'violence', 'slapstick', 'not', 'clearly', 'visible', 'majority', 'modern', 'animated', 'films', 'instance', 'when', 'one', 'minions', 'playfully', 'one', 'workmates', 'Despicable', 'Me', 'good', 'laugh', 'watch', 'teaser', 'trailer', 'Despicable', 'Me', '2', 'coming', 'summer', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'one', 'good', 'punch', 'end', 'funny', 'funny', 'adults', 'so', 'children', 'will', 'find', 'equally', 'funny', 'not', 'exactly', 'proper', 'message', 'be', 'sending', 'impressionable', 'children', 'DreamWorks', 'newest', 'film', 'Croods', 'also', 'much', 'same', 'playful', 'slapstick', 'violence.The', 'Croods', 'story', 'family', 'cavemen', 'living', 'lives', 'constantly', 'fear', 'anything', 'home', 'cave', 'Eep', 'Crood', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'oldest', 'Crood', 'children', 'adolescence', 'age', 'where', 'explore', 'safety', 'zone', 'family', 'cave', 'However', 'father', 'Grug', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'fearful', 'leader', 'family', 'nothing', 'cave', 'safe', 'everything', 'leads', 'death', 'One', 'night', 'Eep', 'Guy', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'adolescent', 'boy', 'roughly', 'same', 'age', 'end', 'world', 'should', 'be', 'preparing', 'True', 'enough', 'series', 'unexplained', 'earthquakes', 'destroy', 'family', 'cave', 'forcing', 'entire', 'family', 'run', 'thrusting', 'adventure', 'find', 'paradise', 'believe', 'called', 'tomorrow', 'Catherine', 'Kenner', 'Clark', 'Duke', 'Cloris', 'Leachman', 'also', 'provide', 'voices', 'film.Much', 'Ice', 'Age', 'film', 'Croods', 'less', 'humorous', 'chase', 'scene', 'family', 'trying', 'steal', 'egg', 'turkey/flamingo', 'creature', 'source', 'food', 'instantly', 'reminiscent', 'too', 'familiar', 'squirrel', 'tirelessly', 'recover', 'nut', 'only', 'be', 'constantly', 'thwarted', 'various', 'coincidental', 'interruptions', 'Several', 'similar', 'occurrences', 'take', 'place', 'film', 'providing', 'only', 'few', 'outstanding', 'moments', 'humor', 'one', 'Crood', 'first', 'interaction', 'fire', 'where', 'essentially', 'everything', 'sight', 'up', 'being', 'lit', 'fire.In', 'character', 'development', 'department', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'traits', 'characters', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'established', 'other', 'animated', 'films', 'Clearly', 'film', 'family', 'featuring', 'father', 'vs.', 'daughter', 'dynamic', 'not', 'mention', 'father', 'dealing', 'losing', 'daughter', 'male', 'suitor', 'As', 'far', 'supporting', 'cast', 'serve', 'nothing', 'more', 'family', 'clich', 'eacute', 'including', 'irritating', 'mother-in-law', 'moronic', 'fat', 'son', 'baby', 'family', 'dog', 'are', 'moments', 'where', 'characters', 'provide', 'few', 'laughs', 'mostly', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'slapstick', 'violence', 'still', 'very', 'little', 'memorable', 'them.Early', 'film', 'theme', 'driven', 'film', 'depicting', 'Croods', 'fearful', 'humans', 'lack', 'sensible', 'knowledge', 'world', 'film', 'father', 'daughter', 'clash', 'nature', 'living', 'life', 'Eep', 'arguing', 'there', 'be', 'more', 'life', 'living', 'life', 'filled', 'fear', 'hidden', 'away', 'cave', 'Grug', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'moment', ""n't"", 'include', 'fear', 'course', 'film', 'Grug', 'more', 'focal', 'point', 'one', 'learn', 'fight', 'fears', 'take', 'chances', 'life', 'accept', 'certain', 'risks.Overall', 'Croods', 'average', 'animated', 'film', 'yet', 'severely', 'lacks', 'memorability', 'Nevertheless', 'animation', 'sharp', 'colorful', 'eye-pleasing', 'easily', 'contains', 'enough', 'light-heated', 'adventure', 'sustain', 'attention', 'most', 'children.Overall', 'Film', 'Grade', 'C-FNDNreview.com']",N/A

1647089,AG8K92N37MT27,B00CHVIAS4,Garnet,"[0, 0]","Okay, this was not my favorite animated movie of all time, not even close.  It was watchable, but I doubt I will be sitting down to view it every year like I do with Toy Story or The Incredibles.  Basically, its not a treasure, but a movie you can sit down and see with the kids on some lazy afternoon.The story is set in some mythological Stone Age.  I say mythological because the creatures we see are pretty unrealistic...cute, but unrealistic.  I mean, a tiger-like creature with parrot colors?  Flying birds that eat someone down to the bone in a few seconds?  Plus, the main predator that is hunting this family, of which I never could figure out what kind of creature that was supposed to be.Be that as it may, our family includes the father, Grug, who teaches his wife and kids and the grandma to fear the outside world...due to the fact that so many things want to kill and eat you.  They only go out of the cave to find food, which seemed to involve way more work than the calories would give you energy for.  A cute scene that reminded you of a high stakes football game, with an egg instead of a ball, but it honestly made little sense.  Then it all changes and their life (survival really) changes.Some spoilers below:Again, be that as it may...Eep is a red-haired daughter who is tired of being told what she can't do, because there is little she can do.  She longs for more.  One night, she creeps out of the cave when she sees a light and discovers...FIRE!  Oh, and the guy who discovered it, curiously named...Guy.  Of course, they end up liking each other and Grug isn't happy with that, or the fact that Guy is encouraging his daughter (and family) to leave behind their safe refuge and go out into the world more.  Of course, this decision is taken away from them due to the impending End Of The World (one imagines it has something to do with the break-up of the continents, but that's never really made too clear).  Guy is intent on leading them to this mountain, where he thinks they will be safe?  Or they are supposed to leave the mountain for the Sun?  Again, unclear.  Got the end of the movie and it was still unclear.There are plenty of funny bits along the way, colorful (fantasy) creatures, and the invention of wearing (LIVE!) animals as part of your clothing.  The interaction between Grug and Gran remind you that the strife between mother-in-law-and son-in-law go back to the beginnings...apparently.  Sandy, the younger daughter, is also pretty funny as she hardly talks, mostly growls, and can run down most things and take them out.  The older son is much more like Grug, but not half as smart.  He also discovers the first pet!  The mother, on the other hand, was rather forgettable as a character, sadly.This movie might have been better with more build-up of the characters and an end goal that made more sense.  I did really enjoy their first interaction with fire, though, and the animation was quite well done.  The action scenes were also pretty good and this movie WILL be entertaining enough for the kids, but its not so much for the adults as Toy Story or The Incredibles or even Brave.",3,"Mostly Okay, Not Great",1386115200,"12 4, 2013",2013,3134,"['Okay', 'was', 'not', 'favorite', 'animated', 'movie', 'time', 'not', 'even', 'close', 'was', 'watchable', 'doubt', 'will', 'be', 'sitting', 'view', 'year', 'do', 'Toy', 'Story', 'Incredibles', 'Basically', 'not', 'treasure', 'movie', 'can', 'sit', 'down', 'see', 'kids', 'lazy', 'afternoon.The', 'story', 'set', 'mythological', 'Stone', 'Age', 'say', 'mythological', 'creatures', 'see', 'are', 'pretty', 'unrealistic', 'cute', 'unrealistic', 'mean', 'tiger-like', 'creature', 'parrot', 'colors', 'Flying', 'birds', 'eat', 'someone', 'down', 'bone', 'few', 'seconds', 'main', 'predator', 'hunting', 'family', 'never', 'could', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'kind', 'creature', 'was', 'supposed', 'be.Be', 'may', 'family', 'father', 'Grug', 'who', 'wife', 'kids', 'grandma', 'fear', 'outside', 'world', 'due', 'fact', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'want', 'kill', 'eat', 'only', 'go', 'cave', 'find', 'food', 'seemed', 'involve', 'way', 'more', 'work', 'calories', 'would', 'give', 'energy', 'cute', 'scene', 'reminded', 'high', 'stakes', 'football', 'game', 'egg', 'instead', 'ball', 'honestly', 'made', 'little', 'sense', 'Then', 'changes', 'life', 'survival', 'really', 'changes.Some', 'spoilers', 'Again', 'be', 'may', 'Eep', 'red-haired', 'daughter', 'who', 'tired', 'being', 'told', 'what', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'little', 'can', 'do', 'more', 'One', 'night', 'cave', 'when', 'light', 'discovers', 'FIRE', 'Oh', 'guy', 'who', 'discovered', 'curiously', 'named', 'Guy', 'course', 'end', 'up', 'liking', 'other', 'Grug', ""n't"", 'happy', 'fact', 'Guy', 'encouraging', 'daughter', 'family', 'leave', 'safe', 'refuge', 'go', 'out', 'world', 'more', 'course', 'decision', 'taken', 'away', 'due', 'impending', 'End', 'World', 'one', 'something', 'do', 'break-up', 'continents', 'never', 'really', 'made', 'too', 'clear', 'Guy', 'intent', 'leading', 'mountain', 'where', 'will', 'be', 'safe', 'are', 'supposed', 'leave', 'mountain', 'Sun', 'Again', 'unclear', 'Got', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'still', 'unclear.There', 'are', 'plenty', 'funny', 'bits', 'way', 'colorful', 'fantasy', 'creatures', 'invention', 'wearing', 'LIVE', 'animals', 'part', 'clothing', 'interaction', 'Grug', 'Gran', 'remind', 'strife', 'mother-in-law-and', 'son-in-law', 'go', 'back', 'beginnings', 'apparently', 'Sandy', 'younger', 'daughter', 'also', 'pretty', 'funny', 'hardly', 'talks', 'mostly', 'can', 'run', 'down', 'most', 'things', 'take', 'out', 'older', 'son', 'much', 'more', 'like', 'Grug', 'not', 'half', 'smart', 'also', 'first', 'pet', 'mother', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'rather', 'forgettable', 'character', 'sadly.This', 'movie', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'more', 'build-up', 'characters', 'end', 'goal', 'made', 'more', 'sense', 'did', 'really', 'enjoy', 'first', 'interaction', 'fire', 'animation', 'was', 'quite', 'well', 'done', 'action', 'scenes', 'were', 'also', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'WILL', 'be', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'kids', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'adults', 'Toy', 'Story', 'Incredibles', 'even', 'Brave']",N/A

1647103,A3QAQUUPFIARWB,B00CHVIAS4,"Gord Wilson ""alivingdog.com""","[1, 1]","From the ads, I labelled this film ""Avoid At All Cost"", and threw it into the mental dustbin full of recent way overdone, special-effect heavy, super expensive animated films that are not even worth a first look. But I was with some kids who were watching it, so to humor them, I did also. Five minutes in, I was hooked. One of the co-writers is John Cleese from Monty Python, and another did Lilo and Stitch, which was well-written, despite being overdone in the final wrap (notice how much better the cartoon series was when it didn't have the heavy dramatic element hanging over it). I don't know how that makes a difference, but somehow this film came out incredibly witty, well acted, well played, not overstated, not overdone. Some of the animation also was truly amazing for a CGI film. Especially the eyes. Here's a family film that is rated C for Creative.The next day I was able to view Mr. Peabody and Sherman on a large screen with the same kids (on a military base)Mr. Peabody & Sherman. I really was scared for this one because I love the original segment of the Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoon (despite the fact that some of the last episodes weren't really very well written)Rocky & Bullwinkle & Friends:  The Complete Series. Once I got used to Peabody being a CGI dog, and there being a sort of backstory to his adopting Sherman (which the cartoons never explored), and even though I'd have liked something simpler and more cel-looking, it started being a pretty good film in spite of these objections, and by the end, was nearly a great one.I'm not completely sure who the audience is for this film, but it's got something for everyone. Stay and watch the end credits (which is always a good idea), and you'll see a couple tips of the hat to the original cartoon series. I also learned that the original idea came from Ted Key, who wrote kids' books and the Disney movies Escape to Witch Mountain, Gus, and The Cat From Outer Space. I only hope some of the best characters, like Garfield the cat, Yogi Bear, Felix the cat, Snoopy and Peanuts, get such brilliant star treatment next time they hit the big screen.",5,Color Me Surprised,1401321600,"05 29, 2014",2014,2127,"['ads', 'labelled', 'film', 'Avoid', 'Cost', 'threw', 'mental', 'dustbin', 'full', 'recent', 'way', 'overdone', 'special-effect', 'heavy', 'super', 'expensive', 'animated', 'films', 'are', 'not', 'even', 'first', 'look', 'was', 'kids', 'who', 'were', 'watching', 'so', 'humor', 'did', 'also', 'Five', 'minutes', 'was', 'hooked', 'One', 'co-writers', 'John', 'Cleese', 'Monty', 'Python', 'did', 'Lilo', 'Stitch', 'was', 'well-written', 'being', 'overdone', 'final', 'wrap', 'notice', 'how', 'much', 'better', 'cartoon', 'series', 'was', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'heavy', 'dramatic', 'element', 'hanging', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'difference', 'somehow', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'incredibly', 'witty', 'well', 'acted', 'well', 'played', 'not', 'overstated', 'not', 'overdone', 'animation', 'also', 'was', 'truly', 'amazing', 'CGI', 'film', 'Especially', 'eyes', 'Here', 'family', 'film', 'rated', 'C', 'Creative.The', 'next', 'day', 'was', 'able', 'view', 'Mr.', 'Peabody', 'Sherman', 'large', 'screen', 'same', 'kids', 'military', 'base', 'Mr.', 'Peabody', 'Sherman', 'really', 'was', 'scared', 'one', 'love', 'original', 'segment', 'Rocky', 'Bullwinkle', 'cartoon', 'fact', 'last', 'episodes', 'were', ""n't"", 'really', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'Rocky', 'Bullwinkle', 'Friends', 'Complete', 'Series', 'Once', 'got', 'used', 'Peabody', 'being', 'CGI', 'dog', 'there', 'being', 'sort', 'backstory', 'adopting', 'Sherman', 'cartoons', 'never', 'explored', 'even', ""'d"", 'have', 'liked', 'something', 'simpler', 'more', 'cel-looking', 'started', 'being', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'spite', 'objections', 'end', 'was', 'nearly', 'great', 'one.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'completely', 'sure', 'who', 'audience', 'film', 'got', 'something', 'everyone', 'Stay', 'watch', 'end', 'credits', 'always', 'good', 'idea', ""'ll"", 'see', 'couple', 'tips', 'hat', 'original', 'cartoon', 'series', 'also', 'learned', 'original', 'idea', 'came', 'Ted', 'Key', 'who', 'wrote', 'kids', 'books', 'Disney', 'movies', 'Escape', 'Witch', 'Mountain', 'Gus', 'Cat', 'From', 'Outer', 'Space', 'only', 'hope', 'best', 'characters', 'Garfield', 'cat', 'Yogi', 'Bear', 'Felix', 'cat', 'Snoopy', 'Peanuts', 'get', 'such', 'brilliant', 'star', 'treatment', 'next', 'time', 'hit', 'big', 'screen']",N/A

1647112,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B00CHVIAS4,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","One of my recent regrets is not having watched The Croods in the theater; how awesome must it have looked on the giant screen, with its colors that pop and resplendent vistas detailed with such exquisite photorealism they could've been lifted straight off Avatar. And should you never mind the stunning eye candy, maybe the riotous family dynamics will engage you.I guess it's always been so that teenage girls assume their dads simply can't cope with the advances of an ever-changing world. Take brutish prehistoric patriarch Grug Crood (Nicolas Cage) who at ad nauseam preaches to his family that one should ""never not be afraid."" This maxim may go down solid with his wife Ugga (Catherine Keener), his son Thunk (Clark Duke), his granny Gran (Cloris Leachman), and that savage, savage baby - but his restless daughter Eep (Emma Stone) wants none of his cautious approach. Like Ariel from The Little Mermaid, Eep pines for adventure, longs to explore what's that over yonder.While out on an unpermitted excursion from the Croods' cave, Eep runs into a strange (re: more evolved) guy named Guy (Ryan Reynolds), him what's prophesying the end of the world and wearing his pet monkey, whose name is Belt, for a belt (Guy explains: ""...cook, conversationalist, navigator... also, keeps my pants up"").Truth is, Pangea is breaking apart, and when the latest bit of cataclysm collapses the family cave, there's nothing for it but for the Croods to embark on a desperate cross-country trek to safe haven. Grug the patriarch is pretty freaked out about this.DreamWorks hasn't yet built up the cachet to match that of Pixar's, but it's not for lack of trying. DreamWorks' How to Train Your Dragon, for my money, stands up to the best in Pixar's body of work. The Croods fall just a notch below that. Saying that isn't a knock on The Croods as much as it is a testament to the superior quality of How to Train Your Dragon and the Pixar classics. It's old hat today to marvel at how flawless the CG animation looks for whatever animated film. With the tech now available, any big time studio can pull off the impeccable visuals. Still, props for the realization of such a vibrant topography. It's a harsh and hostile world the Croods (and Guy) must traipse thru, but oh so pretty to look at.The humor is plentiful and is the good kind, meaning that both young and old can savor the funny. I like that there are seemingly throwaway gags that come back later on to fill a role. So sue me, the 6-year-old in me busted a gut when the punch monkeys showed up. Admittedly, the pet monkey's catch phrase got old after a while (especially when the dang kids kept repeating it for many days later). Also present and sort of cute are them obligatory comic references to the modern day zeitgeist and how the Croods' behavior and interpersonal conflicts reflect contemporary values. I do like the Croods' version of the camera.At the core of the movie - what gives it its beating heart - is a tender father-daughter story. We note Grug's discomfort as he feels his leadership slowly slip away as Guy's more progressive methods and ideas begin to latch on to the group. We see his position as Eep's dad threatened as the attraction between Eep and Guy grows. Wow, The Croods is like Father of the Bride. I can totally see Grug losing it in the supermarket and trying to match the hot dogs with the hot dog buns. Wait, can Grug count? Anyway, the back end of the movie reveals a pretty sobering turn of events, and this makes Grug's emotional arc resonate that much more. The Croods is delightful, full of pranks and awesome visuals and even a message that's profound in its simplicity. In protest to what her dad's been preaching, Eep retorts: ""There's a difference between living and not dying."" That's deep, Eep.The DVD's bonus stuff:- ""Belt's Cave Journal"" (00:06:16 minutes)- ""Croods' Cuts: Lost Scenes"" - 4 deleted scenes with introductions by co-writers & co-directors Chris Sanders and Kirk DeMicco (totaling 00:08:26 minutes)- Theaterical Trailer",4,"""Dun-dun-daahhhh!""",1393200000,"02 24, 2014",2014,4031,"['One', 'recent', 'regrets', 'not', 'having', 'watched', 'Croods', 'theater', 'how', 'awesome', 'must', 'have', 'looked', 'giant', 'screen', 'colors', 'pop', 'resplendent', 'vistas', 'detailed', 'such', 'exquisite', 'photorealism', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'lifted', 'straight', 'Avatar', 'should', 'never', 'mind', 'stunning', 'eye', 'candy', 'maybe', 'riotous', 'family', 'dynamics', 'will', 'engage', 'you.I', 'guess', 'always', 'been', 'so', 'teenage', 'girls', 'assume', 'dads', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'cope', 'advances', 'ever-changing', 'world', 'Take', 'brutish', 'prehistoric', 'patriarch', 'Grug', 'Crood', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'who', 'ad', 'nauseam', 'preaches', 'family', 'one', 'should', 'never', 'not', 'be', 'afraid', 'maxim', 'may', 'go', 'down', 'solid', 'wife', 'Ugga', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'son', 'Thunk', 'Clark', 'Duke', 'granny', 'Gran', 'Cloris', 'Leachman', 'savage', 'savage', 'baby', 'restless', 'daughter', 'Eep', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'none', 'cautious', 'approach', 'Ariel', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'Eep', 'pines', 'adventure', 'longs', 'explore', 'what', 'yonder.While', 'out', 'unpermitted', 'excursion', 'Croods', 'cave', 'Eep', 'strange', 're', 'more', 'evolved', 'guy', 'named', 'Guy', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'what', 'prophesying', 'end', 'world', 'wearing', 'pet', 'monkey', 'name', 'Belt', 'belt', 'Guy', 'cook', 'conversationalist', 'navigator', 'also', 'keeps', 'pants', 'up', '.Truth', 'Pangea', 'breaking', 'apart', 'when', 'latest', 'bit', 'cataclysm', 'family', 'cave', 'nothing', 'Croods', 'embark', 'desperate', 'cross-country', 'trek', 'safe', 'haven', 'Grug', 'patriarch', 'pretty', 'freaked', 'out', 'this.DreamWorks', ""n't"", 'yet', 'built', 'up', 'cachet', 'match', 'Pixar', 'not', 'lack', 'trying', 'DreamWorks', 'How', 'Train', 'Your', 'Dragon', 'money', 'up', 'best', 'Pixar', 'body', 'work', 'Croods', 'fall', 'just', 'notch', 'Saying', ""n't"", 'knock', 'Croods', 'as', 'much', 'testament', 'superior', 'quality', 'How', 'Train', 'Dragon', 'Pixar', 'classics', 'old', 'hat', 'today', 'marvel', 'how', 'flawless', 'CG', 'animation', 'animated', 'film', 'tech', 'now', 'available', 'big', 'time', 'studio', 'can', 'pull', 'off', 'impeccable', 'visuals', 'Still', 'props', 'realization', 'such', 'vibrant', 'topography', 'harsh', 'hostile', 'world', 'Croods', 'Guy', 'must', 'traipse', 'thru', 'oh', 'so', 'pretty', 'look', 'at.The', 'humor', 'plentiful', 'good', 'kind', 'meaning', 'young', 'old', 'can', 'savor', 'funny', 'like', 'are', 'seemingly', 'throwaway', 'gags', 'come', 'back', 'later', 'fill', 'role', 'sue', '6-year-old', 'busted', 'gut', 'when', 'punch', 'monkeys', 'showed', 'up', 'Admittedly', 'pet', 'monkey', 'catch', 'phrase', 'got', 'old', 'while', 'especially', 'when', 'dang', 'kids', 'kept', 'repeating', 'many', 'days', 'later', 'Also', 'present', 'sort', 'cute', 'are', 'obligatory', 'comic', 'references', 'modern', 'day', 'zeitgeist', 'how', 'Croods', 'behavior', 'interpersonal', 'conflicts', 'reflect', 'contemporary', 'values', 'do', 'Croods', 'version', 'camera.At', 'core', 'movie', 'what', 'beating', 'heart', 'tender', 'father-daughter', 'story', 'note', 'Grug', 'discomfort', 'leadership', 'slowly', 'away', 'Guy', 'more', 'progressive', 'methods', 'ideas', 'begin', 'latch', 'group', 'see', 'position', 'Eep', 'dad', 'threatened', 'attraction', 'Eep', 'Guy', 'grows', 'Wow', 'Croods', 'Father', 'Bride', 'can', 'totally', 'see', 'Grug', 'losing', 'supermarket', 'trying', 'match', 'hot', 'dogs', 'hot', 'dog', 'buns', 'Wait', 'can', 'Grug', 'count', 'Anyway', 'back', 'end', 'movie', 'pretty', 'sobering', 'turn', 'events', 'Grug', 'emotional', 'arc', 'resonate', 'much', 'more', 'Croods', 'delightful', 'full', 'pranks', 'awesome', 'visuals', 'even', 'message', 'profound', 'simplicity', 'protest', 'what', 'dad', 'been', 'preaching', 'Eep', 'difference', 'living', 'not', 'dying', 'deep', 'Eep.The', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'stuff', 'Belt', 'Cave', 'Journal', '00:06:16', 'minutes', 'Croods', 'Cuts', 'Lost', 'Scenes', '4', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'introductions', 'co-writers', 'co-directors', 'Chris', 'Sanders', 'Kirk', 'DeMicco', 'totaling', '00:08:26', 'minutes', 'Theaterical', 'Trailer']",N/A

1647159,A356HRZZFCEGL1,B00CHVIAS4,"John Panagopoulos ""John Andrew Panagopoulos""","[1, 2]","***This review may contain spoilers.***Actually, the eponymous family in Dreamworks' ""The Croods"" doesn't really have all that much in common with the Flintstones.  For example, they don't have the Flintstones' primitive technological conveniences like the Flintmobile.  The Croods don't even have primitive weapons like spears and clubs, and sometimes they even run on all fours like gorillas or chimpanzees.  What's worse, they live in an otherworldly, dangerous prehistoric environment that makes ""Jumanji"" look like a petting zoo.  Therefore, in a way, you really can't blame burly Crood father/leader Grug (voice of Nicolas Cage) for being maniacally preoccupied with keeping his family safe.This bunch of pre-Neanderthals - Grug's wife Ugga (voice of Catherine Keener), slow-witted and klutzy middle son Thunk (Clark Duke), fierce and animalistic toddler daughter Sandy (voice of Randy Thom), caustic Gran (voice of Cloris Leachman), and especially independent-minded elder daughter Eep (voice of Emma Stone) - are all agile, swift and strong fighters.  Even so, the Croods are so cautious and fearful that they venture out into the wild only long enough to forage for food (as in the energetic keep-away/football game they play with a wild bird-type to capture its egg toward the film's start).  Then, it's off to the safety of the cave, with a boulder door to keep the beasts out.  Following Grug's motto of ""Life is fear, all the time"", the family even sleeps curled up in a ball for mutual safety.  Except for teenage daughter Eep, who increasingly resents her family's lack of daring, curiosity, and eagerness to explore and learn.One night, breaking curfew, Eep literally runs into a good-looking Cro-Magnon type named Guy (Ryan Reynolds) and his all-purpose miniature sloth Belt (voice of Chris Sanders). Though somewhat inferior to Eep in power and athletic prowess, Guy is inventive, self-reliant, and keen on learning new things.  All of Guy's qualities attract Eep to him, although Guy is a bit put-off by Eep's rough and yes, crude, manner.  But Guy really doesn't have a choice; Eep brings Guy to meet the fam, who manage to appall Guy even more.  Grug is equally unimpressed and a bit wary of Guy in turn, not only because of a budding relationship with Eep, but also because Guy's intelligent and adventuresome boldness reflects badly on Grug's ignorant timidity. Taken aback, Guy at first tries to leave.But natural, seismic upheavals and the terrain change caused by Pangea's splintering force Guy and the Croods to work together to cross the treacherous landscape to find a new home.  Can Guy's ideas and experience coupled with the Croods' brawn and agility get them through?  Can Grug surmount his shortcomings to help his family get through?  Will Grug realize - as Eep and Guy do - that courage as well as exposure to new ideas will help them not only survive, but also prosper?""The Croods"" answers these questions with an unexpected blend of knockabout slapstick, sharp but not harsh verbal humor (not even the death fantasies Grug harbors for his mother-in law Gran), and relevant life lessons about survival, facing your inhibitions, maturing, using both strength and intelligence to move ahead and expand your horizons.  Therefore, ""The Croods"" will probably enthrall all family members, from fidgety toddlers to thoughtful, sophisticated adults, as they watch the Croods, especially stick-in-the-mud Grug, tackle the challenge of evolution in all senses of the word.",4,Croo-oods!

Thomason ""Movie Family""","[0, 0]","The Croods (in eye popping 3D) Bowling for Movies Score: 239.625 of 300On a cold, dark day in Houston, mid-summer, a dream was hatched - a dream of creating a way to organize a vast movie collection.  Oh sure, there are movie ""critics"" and manifold movie blogs and periodicals but these so called ""professionals"" often are out of touch with what I like to call ""The Average Dude"" - you know, your standard issue person on the street.  ""Hey,"" I thought, ""I'm just an average dude aaaaand I have way too much time on my hands aaaaaaand an unordinary number of movies at my finger-tips - literally hundreds and hundreds - and I was endowed with a natural proclivity towards gab.""  This brain flower blossom and bore the fruit which is Bowling for Movies.Like a mad scientist in his lab, I sat down and created an entirely new system for ranking movies.  Utilizing a plastic spatula, I blended both modern and archaic technology in a synergetic explosion of quasi/pseudo-science which renders Hollywood magic down to a comprehensive (if not patentable) bowling score (which actually has nothing to do with bowling).  Should a movie be simple ok, not really good, not really bad it would receive a score of 108 of 300;  crest 192 of 300 and you've got a bona fidable GOOD movie; crack what I like to call The Hot 200 and you've got a real gem.The Croods - We own the Blu Ray 3D, Blu Ray, DVD, Digital Copy combo pack (dude, that's like every version of the film imaginable, crazy huh?)Synoptically Speaking - what's it about?Nicolas Cage leads a star-studded voice cast as the over-protective caveman father Grug Crood in this beautifully rendered story about a family of cave-people who live life by a simple rule: Never be NOT safe.  When rebellious, and frankly quite selfish, daughter Eep (Emma Stone) hits that ""know it all"" stage the entire family's life gets turned upside-down.  Eep has a chance meeting with a ""modern"" human boy named Guy (Ryan Reynolds) who has a head full of `new' ideas and the ability to make fire... and naturally Eep thinks he's the best thing since sliced bread (which as I think of it probably should be the greatest thing before sliced bread on account of the prehistoric nature of the flick predating bread and therefore slicing of the bread by many millennium).  When tectonic plate drift set off sudden and ever-escalating natural disasters, the family is forced to leave the safety of the cave and set out, with Guy's help, across a strange and dangerous jungle full of every sort of fantastical animal one could imagine - absolutely outside of Grug's safety  zone.  Will the Crood family make it to safety?  Will Guy and Eep's relationship blossom while under her father's watchful eye?  Will Grug's cantankerous mother-in-law outlive them all?  Can a caveman embrace new ideas to save his growing family?  All these questions and more are answered in beautifully creative and masterfully animated 3D.All things considered I have to claim conscious interference when talking about the latest DreamWorks offering - I'm not too far off from a caveman myself and Little Miss Movie Dude's 14th birthday is like TOMORROW so I found myself identifying with Grug...  my little baby girl is growing up and testing her wings (which naturally means testing my patience) and, clich&eacute; of clich&eacute;s, I'm wondering where the time has gone.  I assumed it would be a good movie, DreamWorks has been moving towards high caliber stories for a while - and although they fall just short of Pixar's emotional impact level - this movie had surprising depth of character and more heart than I've seen this side of Disney/Pixar's ""Up"".  There is a rather delicate story here of the love shared between father and daughter and the literal evolution of Grug's role in Eep's life.  This subtle story is set during a period of climatic upheaval which lends itself to many funny scenes which is sure to keep younger audiences entertained.Hey, Movie Dude - what a gem of a flick, what did you like most?~  Wonderful coming of age story that gently moves a caveman to evolve to greater heights of understanding and acceptance~ A great blending of pure cartoon animation with incredibly life-like, photo-realistic surroundings~ A top notch soundtrack is a staple of any great film but I have to take my hat off to DreamWorks for pulling together a marching band and other instrumental songs to punctuate the emotional soul of this filmOk Movie Dude, what did you detract points for?~ I loved the film but it shared a rebellious frizzy haired girl who won't listen to her parents type quality with Disney's Brave - I won't go as far as say it's a Brave clone but I'll say this theme has been used (and used, and used) beforeHey, if you have a question about this review, feel free to leave a comment and I will try to answer promptly.

1647189,A2DCS39GFBJV24,B00CHVIAS4,Kenya Starflight,"[0, 0]","I've always had a bit of mixed feeling toward Dreamworks' output.  While they've created some amazing films, they've also produced some mediocre, annoying films that I can't really stand to watch.  I rank movies such as ""How To Train Your Dragon,"" ""Rise of the Guardians,"" and ""Megamind"" among my favorite movies ever, while the endless parade of ""Madagascar"" and ""Shrek"" films mostly annoy me.  And while their animation and storytelling abilities have improved greatly over the years, their movies relying less and less on quickly-dated pop culture references and celebrity voice actors to cash in at the theaters, I still prefer Pixar for most of my 3D-animated classics.  Maybe I'm being harsh, but then again, this studio did produce ""Shark Tale...""When I saw advertisements for ""The Croods,"" I was expecting a film a step down from ""How To Train Your Dragon.""  I was pleasantly surprised to find that, while the film isn't a masterpiece, it's still very entertaining, visually creative, and even sweet.""The Croods"" follows a family of Neanderthals, the titular Croods, as they fight to survive during the awkward pre-civilized days of the world.  Family patriarch Grug (voiced by Nicholas Cage) goes by the philosophy of ""never not be afraid,"" and he emphasizes this by forbidding the family from leaving the cave at night or from trying to explore beyond their homelands.  Teenage daughter Eep (voiced by Emma Stone) resents her father's rules and longs for adventure and something new, but gets a lot more than she bargained for when an earthquake destroys the family's cave.  Terrified and lost in a strange new world, the family reluctantly accepts the help of a wandering Cro-Magnon boy named Guy (voiced by Ryan Reynolds), who claims the world is ending and they have to get to ""high ground"" to survive.  Along the way Eep will find the adventure she's looking for, and the entire family, including Grug, will learn that there's far more to life and the world than simple fear.Like most DreamWorks movies, ""The Croods"" falls back on a big-name cast to carry it's voices, with such names as Nicholas Cage, Emma Stone, Ryan Reynolds, and Cloris Leachman.  Thankfully, the ""star power"" of the movie doesn't threaten to overwhelm it, and the voices feel natural coming out of the characters' mouths.  Even Cage, who's notorious for simply playing himself in every movie he's in, does a good job as Grug.  Perhaps playing a voice instead of a face on screen helps him rein himself in a bit more...The animation in this film is great as well, easily on par with most Pixar films.  The environments are lavishly detailed, both the dry desert where the Croods are shown first living and the lush colorful jungles they traverse through in their search for a new home.  The animals in the film are a wild mix, each a blend of two different animals (turtle birds, land whales, piranha birds, dog lizards, two different big cats that are colored and modeled after an owl and a parrot respectively).  This can be a bit jarring for people who know their prehistoric animals or are used to the somewhat more realistic-looking critters of the ""Ice Age"" movies, but it does make the movie a visual treat.While not as imaginative a story as some (it's basically ""The Land Before Time"" with cavemen instead of dinosaurs), it's still a fun one, and the antics of the family help carry it.  The Croods are a delightfully, well, crude bunch, still establishing basic social mores and showing amazement and even fear at every new sight, whether it's fire or new animals or even something as simple as the concept of shoes.  And anyone who comes from a good-sized family, especially a multi-generational one, can probably identify with at least one of the characters, whether it's the rebellious Eep or the bumbling brother Thunk or even the stubborn but fiercely protective Grug.  Grug's eagerness to see his mother-in-law die can be a bit off-putting, though, and seemed to be a needlessly harsh running gag throughout the movie.While it's not on par with ""How To Train Your Dragon,"" ""The Croods"" is still one of Dreamworks' better CGI films.

This is Dreamworks' ""The Croods"".Directors Kirk Di Micco (Spacechimps) and Chris Sanders (How to Train Your Dragon) teamed up with Monty Python alumni John Cleese (A Fish Called Wanda, Harry Potter) to also co-write this wonderful story. It is filled with imagination, color, heart and lots and lots of humor.Nicolas Cage  (National Treasure, Face Off) plays the father Grug and is having a hard keeping his family happy. His main mission is to protect them by staying in a cave and fearing everything all the time everywhere to stay alive. His daughter Eep, voiced by Emma Stone (The Help, The Amazing Spider-Man), is trying learn more about her prehistoric world she lives in. She loves color, nature, exploring and so much more. Her brother Thunk, voiced by Clark Duke (The Office, Kick-Ass), is not much more intelligent than a rock and certainly prevents his sister from letting her family know the world outside is not all fear and danger. Why, because Thunk is a walking disaster.Now throw in the mother whose main concern is keeping the peace in the family. The father-daughter relationship is maturing and changing and it seems to be driving the family apart with their different world views - albeit it is 50 million years ago. The mother is Ugga who is compassionately voiced by Catherine Keener (40 Year Old Virgin, Into The Wild) who has a tough job playing the family referee. Now enter her mother Gran, voiced by Cloris Leachman, who adds a whole other level of comedy and compassion to the mix. She hates the dad (so it may seem) and the dad hates her (so it may seem). It is a typical mother-in-law family relationship and boy do you see it, hear it and the adults will have the most fun watching these two interact because of the very funny real humor they add.Its Eep who loves exploration and one day she ventures out and meets a young guy named Guy, voiced by Ryan Reynolds (The Green Lantern, The Proposal) who teaches her that there is color and amazing interesting things out in the world they live it. He also knows that they must travel away quickly to run from their environment which is changing and evolving due to the volcanic shifts the Earth is making. It's a fantasy, sci-fi premise that they took on a humanizing, if in a fun and fanciful way. Oh did I mention that one of the funniest characters is belt that Guy wears? It's hysterical!What surprised me most was the amazing heart this film has. Not only is it hysterically funny with the imaginative prehistoric creatures they've created, but the relationships of the family are real. You'll feel for each of them. You'll laugh out loud several times. Most amazingly you'll be touched by their actions and you might even shed a happy tear or two or three.Alan Silvestri (Back To The Future, Who Framed Roger Rabbit) did an amazing score for the films and the kids will love the colors, action and creatures. The adults will love the story, relationships and the very clever humor that is sprinkled throughout the movie.

1647242,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00CHVIAS4,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","It seems like Hollywood has learned that there is money to be made in children's animated features. Perhaps not the time consuming drawn animation but the computer animated feature. Almost every month a new animated film hits the theaters. For fans this turns into something precious with the release of those same films on DVD to own and treasure for years to come. Are all worth it? Perhaps not. But THE CROODS is one that should be.The movie opens in the early life of a planet much like Earth (with what follows it doesn't appear to be here but close enough). While most families disappear the same can't be said of the Croods. That's because father Grugg lives by a simple rule: don't do anything. The problem is that he has a teenage daughter named Eep who, like most teens, just doesn't seem to want to listen. She wants to explore, to wander the world and see what's out there. Grugg just wants to get by, stay in their cave and go out only as a group to find food. As she points out to him this isn't living, it's existing.One night Eep sees a light shining outside of their cave. She moves the stone placed in front enough to get out and follows the light. What she finds is someone completely unlike her and her family, a young man named Guy. It's apparent that Guy is a bit further along the evolutionary scale than Eep and her group. Not only does he seem different, the light she saw was something she's never witnessed before, namely fire.Guy tries to warn Eep that they all need to move because the end of the world that they know is coming. Their only hope is to make their way to higher ground, a mountain he has seen in the distance. When Eep takes this news back to her family they panic and dismiss Guy's warning. That is until the land begins to shift and shake and the lower mountains on either side of their cave collapse. Had they been inside they would have all perished. Instead they find themselves taking Guy's advice and moving on.This is where most of the story comes from, this fear of the unknown and being willing to take a risk to find out what lies beyond the horizon...literally. While they've always lived their lives in a cave, in fear of any and everything outside of it, there is a whole wide world that the Croods have never seen let alone experienced, a world filled with danger certainly but also with great beauty and mystery as well. Now, with no other options, they will experience this new world first hand.Along the way there is also a rift that develops between father and daughter. While Grugg only has Eep's best interest in mind, she and the rest of the family begin to look up to Guy instead and follow his lead. A defeated Grugg feels he has lost his family but that soon changes.The movie is a delight for the eyes and features some hilarious moments as well. The adventure factor involved is spot on and holds your interest from start to finish. Some of the running jokes in the film, especially those involving Grugg's mother in law, work well and remain funny from start to finish.

1647249,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B00CHVIAS4,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[11, 14]","""The Croods"" is one of those rare family films that is actually about a family.  Like so many of these animated flicks, the plot is supposedly about slapstick humor but is actually about the erosion of father figure Grug's (Nicolas Cage) authority as leader of the family unit.  Throw in a burgeoning romance between his eldest daughter Eep (Emma Stone) with stranger Guy (Ryan Reynolds) and you have...well you have the exact same plot of ""Hotel Transylvania."" Only better.In the world of the Neanderthal, the Croods have to work hard to stay alive, a fact the film never shies away from.  A thrilling hunt sequence concludes with barely enough food to feed wife Ugga (Catherine Keener), baby Sandy (Randy Thom), son Thunk (Clark Duke) and arch-nemesis/mother-in-law Gran (Cloris Leachman). Their brutal world involves spending most of the day hunting for eggs in the desert, and then cowering in a heap in a cave at night. In case it's not clear, ""The Croods"" demonstrates that Grug's over-protectiveness is well-earned by throwing, get this, a bearowl at the family over and over.  This is probably the closest gamers are ever going to see the Dungeons & Dragons equivalent of an owlbear on screen.The true threat turns out to be both physical and existential: first in the inevitable separation of Pangea and then the arrival of a boy.  That boy happens to be homo sapien Guy and his pet sloth, Belt (Chris Sanders).  Guy has lots of interesting ideas like fire, puppets, and an apocalyptic vision that piques cute redhead Neanderthal Eep's interest in him.  You can guess where this is going, right?When the apocalypse destroys the cavemen's cave, the family is forced into a land lush with vegetation, animals, food - and predators.  Lots and lots of predators. Where and when the Croods live is undefined, but it's a lot like ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" in that fauna is a mix of two or more animals: mousephants, piranhakeets, liyotes, jackrobats...you get the idea.  Grug discovers that his usual fight or flight tactics are not enough in this strange new world.  It will require flexibility, courage, and no small amount of imagination to reach their new home.Along the way, ""The Croods"" isn't afraid to make fun of family dynamics. Grug routinely trains Thunk to take the lead in the hunt even though it's obvious Eep is the superior of just about every character on screen, including the physically weaker object of her affection, Guy.  Much of Grug's motivation is determined by the possibility that elderly Gran will finally kick the bucket. And Eep must learn how to separate herself from her family without losing her identity.  It's heavy stuff for a kid's film.Most of the time the film rumbles along at a breakneck pace, careening from natural disasters to bizarre animals and back again.  But then there's a lot of talk about feelings, Grug threatens Guy, and Guy comes up with a solution involving genre-stretching puppets.  This happens not once, but twice, and during those talky moments my son fidgeted in his seat.But then more explosions happen, the family rallies, and Belt shouts his trademark, ""Dun, dun, DUNNNN!"" Kids were repeating it in the audience, so mission accomplished.  Although it's not always a smooth ride, any film where the female protagonist is smarter, stronger, and more creative than her male counterparts is a great evolutionary step forward.",4,An evolutionary step forward for female protagonists,1364256000,"03 26, 2013",2013,3392,"['Croods', 'one', 'rare', 'family', 'films', 'actually', 'family', 'so', 'many', 'animated', 'flicks', 'plot', 'supposedly', 'slapstick', 'humor', 'actually', 'erosion', 'father', 'figure', 'Grug', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'authority', 'leader', 'family', 'unit', 'Throw', 'burgeoning', 'romance', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'Eep', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'stranger', 'Guy', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'have', 'well', 'have', 'exact', 'same', 'plot', 'Hotel', 'Transylvania', 'Only', 'world', 'Neanderthal', 'Croods', 'have', 'work', 'hard', 'stay', 'alive', 'fact', 'film', 'never', 'away', 'thrilling', 'hunt', 'sequence', 'barely', 'enough', 'food', 'feed', 'wife', 'Ugga', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'baby', 'Sandy', 'Randy', 'Thom', 'son', 'Thunk', 'Clark', 'Duke', 'arch-nemesis/mother-in-law', 'Gran', 'Cloris', 'Leachman', 'brutal', 'world', 'spending', 'most', 'day', 'hunting', 'eggs', 'desert', 'then', 'cowering', 'heap', 'cave', 'night', 'case', 'not', 'clear', 'Croods', 'Grug', 'over-protectiveness', 'well-earned', 'throwing', 'get', 'bearowl', 'family', 'over', 'probably', 'closest', 'gamers', 'are', 'ever', 'going', 'see', 'Dungeons', 'Dragons', 'equivalent', 'owlbear', 'screen.The', 'true', 'threat', 'out', 'be', 'physical', 'existential', 'first', 'inevitable', 'separation', 'Pangea', 'then', 'arrival', 'boy', 'boy', 'be', 'homo', 'sapien', 'Guy', 'pet', 'sloth', 'Belt', 'Chris', 'Sanders', 'Guy', 'lots', 'interesting', 'ideas', 'fire', 'puppets', 'apocalyptic', 'vision', 'cute', 'redhead', 'Neanderthal', 'Eep', 'interest', 'can', 'guess', 'where', 'going', 'right', 'When', 'apocalypse', 'cavemen', 'cave', 'family', 'forced', 'land', 'lush', 'vegetation', 'animals', 'food', 'predators', 'Lots', 'lots', 'predators', 'Where', 'when', 'Croods', 'live', 'undefined', 'lot', 'Avatar', 'Last', 'Airbender', 'fauna', 'mix', 'two', 'more', 'animals', 'mousephants', 'piranhakeets', 'liyotes', 'jackrobats', 'get', 'idea', 'Grug', 'usual', 'fight', 'flight', 'tactics', 'are', 'not', 'enough', 'strange', 'new', 'world', 'will', 'require', 'flexibility', 'courage', 'small', 'amount', 'imagination', 'reach', 'new', 'way', 'Croods', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'make', 'fun', 'family', 'dynamics', 'Grug', 'routinely', 'Thunk', 'take', 'lead', 'hunt', 'even', 'obvious', 'Eep', 'superior', 'just', 'character', 'screen', 'including', 'physically', 'weaker', 'object', 'affection', 'Guy', 'Much', 'Grug', 'motivation', 'determined', 'possibility', 'elderly', 'Gran', 'will', 'finally', 'kick', 'bucket', 'Eep', 'must', 'learn', 'how', 'separate', 'family', 'losing', 'identity', 'heavy', 'stuff', 'kid', 'film.Most', 'time', 'film', 'along', 'breakneck', 'pace', 'careening', 'natural', 'disasters', 'bizarre', 'animals', 'back', 'again', 'then', 'lot', 'talk', 'feelings', 'Grug', 'Guy', 'Guy', 'up', 'solution', 'involving', 'genre-stretching', 'puppets', 'not', 'once', 'twice', 'talky', 'moments', 'son', 'fidgeted', 'seat.But', 'then', 'more', 'explosions', 'happen', 'family', 'Belt', 'trademark', 'Dun', 'dun', 'DUNNNN', 'Kids', 'were', 'repeating', 'audience', 'mission', 'accomplished', 'not', 'always', 'smooth', 'ride', 'film', 'where', 'female', 'protagonist', 'smarter', 'stronger', 'more', 'creative', 'male', 'counterparts', 'great', 'evolutionary', 'step', 'forward']",N/A

They start out of their own because most of their friends have died off from mosquito bites and wild animals. But the Croods have managed to survive because their father never takes any chances. But when the oldest daughter Eep gets separated from her pack, she meets another new human named Guy whose a a bit of a loner. Sparks fly and Dad isn't happy but they still follow him into a brave new world that offers better food and conditions. The only problem is they have to face a lot of new challenges and father Crood does not like change.This adorable movie is a great choice for the whole family. The characters are hilarious. I especially like Grandma Crood. She sure had a lot of spunk. I also really enjoyed the artistic interpretation of this Stone Age world.

1647280,AHF97M45JFCB,B00CHVIAS4,ONENEO,"[1, 2]","You really have to hand it to DreamWorks; often considered second fiddle to the mastery of the CG craft that is Pixar, these guys just continue to release solid family flick after solid family flick.  Known as the &#8220;money studio&#8221;, The Croods is a good example of genuinely clever writing and a solid story carrying a piece over just an inflated budget being used to force advertising down our proverbial throats.Released back in March of 2013 domestically, The Croods was created on a budget of $135-mil, it&#8217;s been a smashing commercial success having taken in well over 587-million and counting.  Never ones to let a franchise opportunity pass them by, DreamWorks already has plans for a sequel and ongoing television series (following in the footsteps of franchises like the Penguins of Madagascar, King-Fu Panda, Monsters Vs. Aliens, How to Train Your Dragon and so on) in the works.The film loosely follows the exploits of teenage cave-girl Eep (Emma Stone) who, in addition to dealing with all of the nonsense that comes with being a human teenager (including alienation from her family, self-discovery and so on), she has the unfortunate distinction of going through puberty during the stone-age.  Worse still, her family (The Croods) aren&#8217;t even the &#8220;sharper&#8221; of the two quickly evolving human species running around.  Nowhere is this more evident than when the dreamy (to Eep anyway) Guy (Ryan Reynolds) comes on the scene with a more upright walking position, lesser forehead and a whole host of useful inventions/ discoveries to share.This would be a win/win if not for Eep&#8217;s father Grug (Nicolas Cage) who, in addition to suddenly discovering his gene pool is in the losing end of the whole survival of the fittest thing; his very manhood becomes threatened when this new hotshot continually shows him up in front of his family.  As you might expect, Grug is frustrated and purposely obstinate to his physical detriment time and time again.The pace of the film is surprisingly brisk and becomes an action piece right on through to its fruition shortly after we&#8217;re introduced to the characters.  Visually, the film is beautiful with a rich color pallet and textures absolutely rife with the perfect amount of detail to hint toward otherworldliness.  As you might suspect, the scale of many of the yet evolving plants and animals occupying planet earth are, well, off the scale.Perhaps most interestingly, the film takes us to a land where many fantastical but lethal evolutionary hybrids dwell, stalk and hunt.  Among these the half dog/ crocodilian called a Crocopup or the colorfully feathered and furred half parrot/ half saber tooth tiger Macawnivore (that quite frankly looks like it may have been lifted and transplanted directly from James Cameron&#8217;s alien world in Avatar).  This results in amazing replay value whereby what&#8217;s going on in the background can be as enjoyable to spot as the main prose for multi-time viewers.Interestingly, the runaway success that is The Croods actually began life as a proposed five-part film deal from Claymation geniuses Aardman (hilariously titled Crood Awakening).  It&#8217;s also the first DreamWorks piece to have been distributed by 20th Century Fox (their prior films were distributed by Paramount Pictures).In conclusion, The Croods will likely appeal to viewers of all interests with its witty writing (especially the subtle scientifically accurate gags), the fast pace and wonderfully unique environments.  While it&#8217;s clear DreamWorks is wasting no time in riding the wave of the film&#8217;s popularity, one can hardly blame them considering the end results here.",4,DreamWorks Tackles Prehistoric Earth With Trademarked Style,1388880000,"01 5, 2014",2014,3691,"['really', 'have', 'hand', 'DreamWorks', 'often', 'considered', 'second', 'fiddle', 'mastery', 'CG', 'craft', 'Pixar', 'guys', 'just', 'continue', 'release', 'solid', 'family', 'flick', 'solid', 'family', 'flick', 'Known', '8220', 'money', 'studio', '8221', 'Croods', 'good', 'example', 'genuinely', 'clever', 'writing', 'solid', 'story', 'carrying', 'piece', 'over', 'just', 'inflated', 'budget', 'being', 'used', 'force', 'advertising', 'down', 'proverbial', 'throats.Released', 'back', 'March', '2013', 'domestically', 'Croods', 'was', 'created', 'budget', '135-mil', '8217', 'been', 'smashing', 'commercial', 'success', 'having', 'taken', 'well', '587-million', 'counting', 'Never', 'ones', 'let', 'franchise', 'opportunity', 'pass', 'DreamWorks', 'already', 'plans', 'sequel', 'ongoing', 'television', 'series', 'following', 'footsteps', 'franchises', 'Penguins', 'Madagascar', 'King-Fu', 'Panda', 'Monsters', 'Vs.', 'Aliens', 'How', 'Train', 'Dragon', 'so', 'works.The', 'film', 'loosely', 'exploits', 'teenage', 'cave-girl', 'Eep', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'who', 'addition', 'dealing', 'nonsense', 'being', 'human', 'teenager', 'including', 'alienation', 'family', 'self-discovery', 'so', 'unfortunate', 'distinction', 'going', 'puberty', 'stone-age', 'Worse', 'still', 'family', 'Croods', 'aren', '8217', 'even', '8220', 'sharper', '8221', 'two', 'quickly', 'evolving', 'human', 'species', 'running', 'around', 'Nowhere', 'more', 'evident', 'when', 'dreamy', 'Eep', 'anyway', 'Guy', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'scene', 'more', 'upright', 'walking', 'position', 'lesser', 'forehead', 'whole', 'host', 'useful', 'inventions/', 'discoveries', 'share.This', 'would', 'be', 'win/win', 'not', 'Eep', '8217', 'Grug', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'who', 'addition', 'suddenly', 'discovering', 'gene', 'pool', 'losing', 'end', 'whole', 'survival', 'fittest', 'thing', 'very', 'manhood', 'becomes', 'threatened', 'when', 'new', 'hotshot', 'continually', 'up', 'front', 'family', 'might', 'expect', 'Grug', 'frustrated', 'purposely', 'obstinate', 'physical', 'detriment', 'time', 'time', 'again.The', 'pace', 'film', 'surprisingly', 'brisk', 'action', 'piece', 'right', 'fruition', 'shortly', '8217', 're', 'introduced', 'characters', 'Visually', 'film', 'beautiful', 'rich', 'color', 'pallet', 'textures', 'absolutely', 'rife', 'perfect', 'amount', 'detail', 'hint', 'otherworldliness', 'might', 'suspect', 'scale', 'many', 'yet', 'evolving', 'plants', 'animals', 'occupying', 'planet', 'earth', 'are', 'well', 'off', 'scale.Perhaps', 'most', 'interestingly', 'film', 'land', 'where', 'many', 'fantastical', 'lethal', 'evolutionary', 'hybrids', 'dwell', 'stalk', 'hunt', 'half', 'dog/', 'crocodilian', 'called', 'Crocopup', 'colorfully', 'feathered', 'furred', 'half', 'parrot/', 'half', 'saber', 'tooth', 'tiger', 'Macawnivore', 'quite', 'frankly', 'looks', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'lifted', 'transplanted', 'directly', 'James', 'Cameron', '8217', 'alien', 'world', 'Avatar', 'results', 'amazing', 'replay', 'value', 'whereby', 'what', '8217', 'going', 'background', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'spot', 'main', 'prose', 'multi-time', 'viewers.Interestingly', 'runaway', 'success', 'Croods', 'actually', 'began', 'life', 'proposed', 'five-part', 'film', 'deal', 'Claymation', 'geniuses', 'Aardman', 'hilariously', 'titled', 'Crood', 'Awakening', '8217', 's', 'also', 'first', 'DreamWorks', 'piece', 'have', 'been', 'distributed', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'prior', 'films', 'were', 'distributed', 'Paramount', 'Pictures', '.In', 'conclusion', 'Croods', 'will', 'likely', 'appeal', 'viewers', 'interests', 'witty', 'writing', 'especially', 'subtle', 'scientifically', 'accurate', 'gags', 'fast', 'pace', 'wonderfully', 'unique', 'environments', '8217', 'clear', 'DreamWorks', 'wasting', 'time', 'riding', 'wave', 'film', '8217', 's', 'popularity', 'one', 'can', 'hardly', 'blame', 'considering', 'end', 'results', 'here']",N/A

1647304,A2DLKD4AC5JV5Q,B00CHVIAS4,Ranny Levy,"[0, 0]","Eep (Emma Stone) and her family are the classic cave people. They grunt when they get mad, they have never seen fire, and they hunt with their bare hands. They are stuck in a cave by their family leader, Husband and Father, Grug, (Nicolas Cage). The reason Grug is having his family stay in the cave is to keep them safe and away from harm. One night Eep, the oldest daughter, lets curiosity get the best of her and finds out that the earth is starting to end and they have to find higher ground to survive. Will they accept the challenge or will they keep hiding in their cave.I really like this film. It's very funny and keeps me laughing at the different situations and scenes. I feel a wide range of emotions as I go from hysterically laughing to a little crying. I absolutely love the 3D animation. It's vivid in colors with the scenes of the landscape, nature and animals in great depth. This is such a fantastic plot and I really like the characters. My favorite character is Eep because she is very brave, curious and just wants a real life. My favorite scene is when Eep is introducing herself and her family from her point of view. I like how she is telling the viewers how life is like for them.""The Croods"" is rated PG with Kirk De Micco (Space Chimps) and Chris Sanders (How to Train your Dragon) directing it. It also stars the voice talents of Ryan Reynolds (Guy), Catherine Keener (Ugga), Cloris Leachman (Gran) and Clark Duke (Thunk). This is DreamWorks 1st animated film about a family going trough and dealing with changes.A big message in this film is that change is not always a bad thing. In addition, it's always good to listen to your parents because they know what's best for you.I recommend ""The Croods"" for ages 6 to 15 but adults will also enjoy it too.I give this film 5 out of 5 stars.

But when an earthquake destroys the family's cave, they are all forced to hazard out into the big bad scary world of threats by nature and hungry prehistoric predators.Written and directed by Chris Sanders and Kirk DeMicco, &#34;The Croods&#34; is lively and fun and built upon the theme of learning to face one's fears and of finding the courage to move on to bigger and better things in spite of the potential dangers lurking along one's path..In addition to the amusing, nicely differentiated family members, there's the customary bevy of cute and cuddly prehistoric creatures (even the threatening ones are kind of cuddly) to make this a fine, non-threatening look at life in prehistoric times, fit even for the more impressionable kiddies.The computer-generated animation is clean, if not exactly envelope-pushing or spectacular, and it makes up in speed what it lacks in sophistication.",4,"Lively, thoughtful crowd-pleaser",1384819200,"11 19, 2013",2013,1649,"['Stone', 'Age', 'family', 'six', 'Croods', 'live', 'world', 'where', 'life', 'nonstop', 'struggle', 'survival', 'where', 'anything', 'new', 'be', 'feared', 'avoided', 'cost', 'least', 'what', 'young', 'Eep', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'been', 'taught', 'believe', 'well-meaning', 'over-protective', 'dad', 'Grug', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'Eep', 'naturally', 'bright', 'curious', 'sort', 'when', 'cute', 'boy', 'Guy', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'living', 'out', 'own', 'who', 'discovered', 'new-fangled', 'thing', 'called', '34', 'fire', '34', 'life', 'mission', 'start', 'venturing', 'out', 'bit', 'more', 'own', 'Guy', 'also', 'more', 'optimistic', 'view', 'life', 'future', 'scaredy-cat', 'dad', 'who', 'huddle', 'family', 'tiny', 'cave', 'safe', 'threats', 'outside', 'when', 'earthquake', 'family', 'cave', 'are', 'forced', 'hazard', 'out', 'big', 'bad', 'scary', 'world', 'threats', 'nature', 'hungry', 'prehistoric', 'predators.Written', 'directed', 'Chris', 'Sanders', 'Kirk', 'DeMicco', '34', 'Croods', '34', 'lively', 'fun', 'built', 'theme', 'learning', 'face', 'one', 'fears', 'finding', 'courage', 'move', 'bigger', 'better', 'things', 'spite', 'potential', 'dangers', 'lurking', 'one', 'path..In', 'addition', 'amusing', 'nicely', 'differentiated', 'family', 'members', 'customary', 'bevy', 'cute', 'cuddly', 'prehistoric', 'creatures', 'even', 'threatening', 'ones', 'are', 'kind', 'cuddly', 'make', 'fine', 'non-threatening', 'look', 'life', 'prehistoric', 'times', 'fit', 'even', 'more', 'impressionable', 'kiddies.The', 'computer-generated', 'animation', 'clean', 'not', 'exactly', 'envelope-pushing', 'spectacular', 'up', 'speed', 'what', 'sophistication']",N/A

A family comedy/adventure from DreamWorks Animation, I had been waiting to see this one - the story of caveman Grug (Nicolas Cage) and his family, as they struggle to survive when both their home and way of life are change forever.Grug has spent his entire parental life teaching his wife and children to be careful.  Change is BAD, darkness is to be feared, and you never ever stray too far from home.  This makes life a little difficult in their prehistoric desert landscape - even fighting for the smallest scraps of food is just that, a fight.  As hard as Grug has worked to maintain safety, he still constantly butts heads with his eldest daughter Eep (Emma Stone), whose natural sense of over-curiosity puts, Grug feels, the family at risk.  When Eep sneaks out of the cave one night and accidentally runs into the free spirit Guy (Ryan Reynolds), she is at first frightened but also very intrigued of him.  And when Guy informs her of the impending end of the world, Eep is as fearful as Grug is skeptical ... until the family's cave is destroyed (in a great action sequence), and the Croods are forced to leave their home and trek across the vast landscape (led by Guy, much to Grug's chagrin and terror), staying just ahead of the destruction as Guy steers them toward safety, and Grug becomes more and more jealous of Guy's taking over as the alpha male of the group.'The Croods' is really funny, the humor leaning toward pratfalls and slapstick - but the film also has its share of tender/real moments that ring true.  The animation is stunning, the film a feast for the eyes, and by the end you will be rooting like hell for the clan all the way.  Nothing really new here, but the characters and story and humor and animation make it all feel fresh, funny and enjoyable, with positive messages for kids about sticking by your family and not being afraid to get out there and explore life and the world around you.Yeah, I got sucked in - I loved it.",5,"Great family film with plenty of laughs and a few tender moments, beautifully made!",1377388800,"08 25, 2013",2013,1988,"['really', 'loved', 'CROODS', 'A', 'family', 'comedy/adventure', 'DreamWorks', 'Animation', 'had', 'been', 'waiting', 'see', 'one', 'story', 'caveman', 'Grug', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'family', 'struggle', 'survive', 'when', 'home', 'way', 'life', 'are', 'change', 'forever.Grug', 'spent', 'entire', 'parental', 'life', 'teaching', 'wife', 'children', 'be', 'careful', 'Change', 'BAD', 'darkness', 'be', 'feared', 'never', 'ever', 'stray', 'too', 'far', 'home', 'life', 'little', 'difficult', 'prehistoric', 'desert', 'landscape', 'even', 'fighting', 'smallest', 'scraps', 'food', 'just', 'that', 'fight', 'As', 'hard', 'Grug', 'worked', 'maintain', 'safety', 'still', 'constantly', 'butts', 'heads', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'Eep', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'natural', 'sense', 'over-curiosity', 'puts', 'Grug', 'feels', 'family', 'risk', 'When', 'Eep', 'cave', 'one', 'night', 'accidentally', 'free', 'spirit', 'Guy', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'first', 'frightened', 'also', 'very', 'intrigued', 'when', 'Guy', 'impending', 'end', 'world', 'Eep', 'as', 'fearful', 'Grug', 'skeptical', 'family', 'cave', 'destroyed', 'great', 'action', 'sequence', 'Croods', 'are', 'forced', 'leave', 'home', 'trek', 'vast', 'landscape', 'led', 'Guy', 'much', 'Grug', 'chagrin', 'terror', 'staying', 'just', 'ahead', 'destruction', 'Guy', 'safety', 'Grug', 'more', 'more', 'jealous', 'Guy', 'taking', 'over', 'alpha', 'male', 'group', 'Croods', 'really', 'funny', 'humor', 'leaning', 'pratfalls', 'slapstick', 'film', 'also', 'share', 'tender/real', 'moments', 'ring', 'true', 'animation', 'stunning', 'film', 'feast', 'eyes', 'end', 'will', 'be', 'rooting', 'hell', 'clan', 'way', 'Nothing', 'really', 'new', 'here', 'characters', 'story', 'humor', 'animation', 'make', 'feel', 'fresh', 'funny', 'enjoyable', 'positive', 'messages', 'kids', 'sticking', 'family', 'not', 'being', 'afraid', 'get', 'there', 'explore', 'life', 'world', 'you.Yeah', 'got', 'sucked', 'loved']",N/A

Epic landscapes, really beautiful movie.The family is barbaric and ignorant and their belief system reflects this. Fear of the unknown and pridefully simple-minded is their way but instead of keeping them safe as it has for so long now it will be their downfall. They meet an innovative character. A real charmer who has skills and intelligence. Their reaction to him at times is absolutely hilarious. The family fire scene is a riot and the one where the boy and girl meet is lovely.The ""message"" is very naturally weaved into the story. It basically IS the story. In general it observes Man's key survival traits - intelligence and ideas but being curious is a necessity as well. Resentment and jealousy are pitiful traits and this movie deals with them by demanding a change of ways.

The daughter is just another girl looking to change her fate (against her father's will), the father is the overprotective type, and Guy is just another adventurer. Talk about typical. I guess I could explain more, but you've already seen most of the plot in Ice Age and other movies. I will say this, a lot of the jokes were stupid and repeated. The father smiles when the grandmother mentions how she might die (expressing his hatred of her), and he does this throughout the movie. It is incredibly wrong, and when he does this for like the 5th time it gets really old. He even says it directly to her face. The baby is basically is a pet. Seriously, not like a pet... an actual pet. She growls, barks, shreds stuff, and pretty much was the opposite of funny. The visuals were average.

This is a story that is highly relatable, not because it's about cavemen, but because it's about a father who feels like he's losing his family.Eep (Emma Stone) doesn't listen to her father, Grug (Nicholas Cage). Grug, like many dads, is overprotective of his daughter, and Eep has come to resent this because she doesn't like spending all of her time in the cave. She wants to go out into the fresh air and have adventures, but Grug's rule is survival first, which means only going outside when the family needs to eat.Like many teenage daughters, Eep is rebellious and doesn't heed her father's warnings, sneaking out of the cave at night. It is during this night stroll that she meets Guy (Ryan Reynolds), and the two soon begin to fall for each other. Eep is obsessed with Guy's ability to make fire, and Guy explains to her that he is on the run from the destruction of the world that's coming, and he's heading for safety. He invites Eep to travel with him, but she refuses, so he hands her a conch and tells her to blow on the shell if she needs him. He then leaves Eep, heading for safety once more.Grug is horrified when he wakes up and discovers Eep missing. He leaves the cave, breaking his own rule, and finds her. He brings her home and she talks about Guy. Eventually, Guy comes back into the picture when what he describes to Eep begins to happen and the Croods' cave is destroyed. Guy comes when he hears the signal, and from this point on Grug is constantly competing with the younger man, trying to keep the family as it once was, trying to keep them from changing and evolving to this new person's mysterious ways.The movie is really touching, and children will love it.

1647398,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B00CHVIAS4,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[17, 20]","If The Croods has a familiar feel to it, it's because it deals with familiar themes - coming of age, fish-out-of-water experiences, confronting one's fears, and of course, the most familiar theme of all, family. That said, there's a lot to be said for the ways in which The Croods takes on these themes. The animation is beautifully done, the voice cast highly talented, and, unlike most other 3D films, the 3D is put to good use here, both of which should not be surprising when you consider that a lot of the same talent that made How To Train Your Dragon, one of the best 3D animated films ever made, was also behind the making of The Croods.Set somewhere in an imagined prehistoric past, the film starts with a pelt-wearing girl named Eep (engagingly voiced by Emma Stone), talking about her family of cave-dwellers living deep in a rocky canyon, who apparently survive by adhering to the strict rules of the head of the family, her over-protective, over-cautious and over-bearing father Grug (Nicolas Cage), the number one rule being 'Never leave the cave!' Back in their cave, Grug is telling a story to the rest of the family - wife Ugga (Catherine Keener), younger daughter Sandy (Randy Thom), son Thunk (Clark Duke), and mother-in-law (the inimitable Cloris Leachman) - using a prop that represents Eep and her curious nature. None too subtly, Grug uses his story - and the unfortunate prop - to warn the family that curiosity, exploration and 'new things' are all threats to their survival and therefore to be avoided at all costs. While the rest of the family are appropriately chastened by Grug's bluntly cautionary tale, it only irritates Eep who longs to see what lies beyond their cave.  And particularly above their cave, where a sliver of blue sky beckons. So when night comes and the rest of the family falls asleep, Eep decides to ignore her father's advice and she leaves the cave.While she's out exploring, Eep unexpectedly meets another another human, a caveboy named Guy (Ryan Reynolds) whose intelligence and adventurous nature are a refreshing change from her cautious risk-averse father. She becomes fascinated when Guy shows her fire for the first time and she immediately wants to learn more.  It also doesn't hurt that Guy is something of a prehistoric hottie who has also apparently invented fashion, aided by his pet/sidekick/accessory, a long-armed mini-sloth named Belt (voiced by Chris Sanders, who was also the voice for Stitch in Lilo & Stitch). Guy ends up telling Eep though about his belief that their world is reaching its 'end' and wants Eep to come with him, but Eep cannot forsake her family.  Before he leaves, Guy gives Eep a horn made from a conch shell which she can use to call him if she feels the need for help. Eep is then found by Grug who had been frantically searching for her, even though it meant leaving the safety and security of the cave. But just as they are returning home, an earthquake brings down the rock walls of the canyon they inhabit, destroying the cave.  Grug and the rest of the family are distraught, but Eep ventures to an opening in the rock walls that the earthquake has created, and there she discovers a new land just beyond, a land filled with lush brightly-colored vegetation and teeming with wildlife, at once beautiful and strange. And in some cases, it turns out, quite, quite dangerous.Venturing reluctantly into this new world, Grug and Eep and the others must learn how to survive in it. And later, when they meet up with Guy, Grug has the additional unwelcome challenge of dealing with the threat (to his authority, anyway) of a younger male whom his daughter is obviously attracted to but who stands for everything he deems dangerous and to be avoided.All of the characters are well done and distinctive, both in their look and in their voicing, but one of the things I particularly liked about the way Eep was drawn was that she actually has the kind of solid, athletic build it would take to engage in the kinds of activities she does - like climbing up rock walls unassisted. You have no trouble believing that she can do the things she does in the film.If, as some people have noted, the quality of the story-telling in The Croods tends to be uneven in places, I think this is due to the film's rather convoluted production history, which is worth relating here. Originally, back in 2005, the film was intended to be a stop-motion animation film to be produced by Aardman Animations as part of a deal with DreamWorks Animation, working from a screenplay by John Cleese (yes, that John Cleese) and Kirk DeMicco, based on a short story called ""The Twits"" by Roald Dahl. Cleese and DeMicco reworked the script to fit a film idea DreamWorks had about two cavemen on the run, one an inventor-type while the other was suspicious of anything new.  But Aardman dropped out of the project in 2007, with the rights to the film reverting to DreamWorks. Chris Sanders, the director of Lilo & Stitch, was brought in by DreamWorks to direct the film, and began making significant rewrites to the script.  But then in September 2008, Sanders took over directing How to Train Your Dragon, which resulted in The Croods being put on the back-burner and its release date pushed back a year. In May 2009, DeMicco was brought back on as co-director, but further delays results in the release date being pushed by yet another year.In the end, the story was something of a mixed result with Sanders and DeMicco as the primary influences. The best parts are clearly the work of Sanders, who not only wrote and directed both Lilo & Stitch and How to Train Your Dragon but also worked as writer on notable films like Mulan, The Lion King, Aladdin and Beauty & the Beast. DeMicco, on the other hand, has a somewhat less stellar record consisting of films like Space Chimps, Racing Stripes and Quest for Camelot.  All things considered, it's remarkable that The Croods turned out as well as it did.Highly recommended for anyone who likes a good story with engaging characters coupled with well-done animation where the 3D actually adds something to the feel of the movie.",4,"Gorgeous animation, engaging characters and good use of 3D make for a highly enjoyable movie",1364515200,"03 29,

Over-protective parents, teenage daughter who finds a really nice boy, family rapprochement in the end. You know, the usual.This time, the family appeared to be Neandertals (the girl had shoulders on her like a blacksmith) and the really nice boy might have been a more modern human type. There's a nice intersection with recent science there: modern humans apparently interbred with Neandertals, and there was every indication of some breeding in the young couple's future. Also, the girl (named Eep) had red hair, and at least some Neandertals are known from DNA analysis to have had red hair.Other than those few points, however, I found this utterly forgettable.
