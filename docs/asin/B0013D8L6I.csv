This is a completely original story about a young man named Miles Challenger--not a character in the original book.  The script incorporates characters and incidents from the book, but the story is totally different.  However, taken on its own merits, the film is entertaining.  Miles is a character young people can relate to, and the film does offer an interesting look at life up north during the Alaska gold rush.

But I was disappointed by Call of the Wild.What Left Me Cold?The film never drew me in. Most of the actors were clearly acting (and not too well at that) rather than becoming part of a compelling story. Character development was so thin that I never cared much what happened.While the scenery and photography were stunning, the editing was poor, and the black screen breaks between scenes distracting. Makeup was obvious, such that I saw makeup rather than seeing the ravages of cold.The relationship between boy and dog was never fully developed. It was there, but emotionless, almost sterile.Overall, I found the movie flat. I enjoyed the scenery but missed the pull of the original story.Five stars for photography, one star for editing, one star for story.  Average: Two stars.",2,You Know You're in Trouble When the Best Actors are Dogs!,1211587200,"05 24, 2008",2008,841,"['wanted', 'like', 'movie', 'expected', 'like', 'movie', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Call', 'Wild.What', 'Left', 'Me', 'Cold', 'film', 'never', 'drew', 'Most', 'actors', 'were', 'clearly', 'acting', 'not', 'too', 'well', 'rather', 'becoming', 'part', 'compelling', 'story', 'Character', 'development', 'was', 'so', 'thin', 'never', 'cared', 'much', 'what', 'scenery', 'photography', 'were', 'stunning', 'editing', 'was', 'poor', 'black', 'screen', 'breaks', 'scenes', 'distracting', 'Makeup', 'was', 'obvious', 'such', 'saw', 'makeup', 'rather', 'seeing', 'ravages', 'cold.The', 'relationship', 'boy', 'dog', 'was', 'never', 'fully', 'developed', 'was', 'there', 'emotionless', 'almost', 'sterile.Overall', 'found', 'movie', 'flat', 'enjoyed', 'scenery', 'missed', 'pull', 'original', 'story.Five', 'stars', 'photography', 'one', 'star', 'editing', 'one', 'star', 'story', 'Average', 'Two', 'stars']",Call of the Wild

I was thinking as I watched it, ""At least they took out the violence so young children can watch it"" but then there's the scene with the frozen stiff man, and the drowning in the frozen water scene was pretty bad for little ones, too.
