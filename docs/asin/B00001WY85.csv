I didn't read the case properly and thought I had chosen a movie about some grisly murders in  New Jersey. So,when I got home, I was surprised to be confronted with what  seemed to be a bona fide documentary. I became totally engrossed in what  became the increasingly unnerving story of an ill fated, overambitious  cable TV expedition to out the Jersey Devil. &quot;Spying in on this crime  about to happen&quot; to quote the character Clare Deforest was infinitely  more chilling than watching some chump in an anorak hacking up preening  college students. I have read at least one review which cites the  amateurish production and acting and the monotone delivery of narrator  David Beard as negative factors. This is essentially why the film works. It  had the right low budget feel of a documentary you might see on a minor  network channel. Most cable shows are amateurish affairs to say the least  and the unsure, almost unprepared delivery of Avalos and Weiler made them  seem all the more natural and real. The location video footage was grainy,  badly focussed and shaky.....exactly what you would expect! With the finest  actors Hollywood has to offer and million dollar camera equipment, the film  would have been unconvincing and much less satisfying.  As to whether  &quot;The Last Broadcast&quot; or &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; came  first...who cares. They are both worthwhile, ingenious movies and  infinitely more disturbing than any of the big bucks frighteners Hollywood  had to offer during the 90's.  So, accept the amateurism evident in  &quot;The Last Broadcast&quot; as vital to its success and be prepared to  be confronted by an all too real and believable murder mystery. Of course,  if you've read this far, you're not likely to be as dumbstruck as I was at  the conclusion and perhaps the best advice I can give you is not to read  the plot synopsis on the back of any horror or suspense video...the less  you know, the more scared you get!",5,Not a documentary?,958694400,"05 19, 2000",2000,2107,"['can', 'only', 'thank', 'lucky', 'stars', 'was', 'hurry', 'when', 'picked', 'up', 'quot', 'Last', 'Broadcast', 'quot', 'local', 'rental', 'store', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'case', 'properly', 'thought', 'had', 'chosen', 'movie', 'grisly', 'murders', 'New', 'Jersey', 'So', 'when', 'got', 'home', 'was', 'surprised', 'be', 'confronted', 'what', 'seemed', 'be', 'bona', 'fide', 'documentary', 'became', 'totally', 'engrossed', 'what', 'became', 'increasingly', 'unnerving', 'story', 'ill', 'fated', 'overambitious', 'cable', 'TV', 'expedition', 'Jersey', 'Devil', 'quot', 'Spying', 'crime', 'happen', 'quot', 'quote', 'character', 'Clare', 'Deforest', 'was', 'infinitely', 'more', 'chilling', 'watching', 'chump', 'anorak', 'hacking', 'up', 'preening', 'college', 'students', 'have', 'read', 'least', 'one', 'review', 'amateurish', 'production', 'acting', 'monotone', 'delivery', 'narrator', 'David', 'Beard', 'negative', 'factors', 'essentially', 'why', 'film', 'had', 'right', 'low', 'budget', 'feel', 'documentary', 'might', 'see', 'minor', 'network', 'channel', 'Most', 'cable', 'shows', 'are', 'amateurish', 'affairs', 'say', 'least', 'unsure', 'almost', 'unprepared', 'delivery', 'Avalos', 'Weiler', 'made', 'seem', 'more', 'natural', 'real', 'location', 'video', 'footage', 'was', 'grainy', 'badly', 'focussed', 'shaky', '..exactly', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'finest', 'actors', 'Hollywood', 'offer', 'million', 'dollar', 'camera', 'equipment', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'unconvincing', 'much', 'less', 'satisfying', 'quot', 'Last', 'Broadcast', 'quot', 'quot', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'quot', 'came', 'first', 'who', 'are', 'worthwhile', 'ingenious', 'movies', 'infinitely', 'more', 'disturbing', 'big', 'bucks', 'frighteners', 'Hollywood', 'had', 'offer', '90', 'So', 'amateurism', 'evident', 'quot', 'Last', 'Broadcast', 'quot', 'vital', 'success', 'be', 'prepared', 'be', 'confronted', 'too', 'real', 'believable', 'murder', 'mystery', 'course', ""'ve"", 'read', 'far', ""'re"", 'not', 'likely', 'be', 'as', 'dumbstruck', 'was', 'conclusion', 'perhaps', 'best', 'advice', 'can', 'give', 'not', 'read', 'plot', 'synopsis', 'back', 'horror', 'suspense', 'video', 'less', 'know', 'more', 'scared', 'get']",N/A

512279,A1GB1Q193DNFGR,B00001WY85,Bruce Lee Pullen,"[1, 2]","For a mere nine hundred dollar budget and extensive use of modern cost-effective computer printshop programs (Adobe Premiere (16MM) and Photoshop (gruesome visual effects), Stefan Avalos and Lance Weiler single-handedly fashioned a whole new type of motion picture, the horror pseudo-doctumentary. Despite a lack of commercial success during its 1998 theatrical run, the Last Broadcast has since received substantial critical notices, a vastly multiplying cult following, and has been attributed as probable inspiration for Daniel Myrick's and Eduardo Sanchez's phenomenally successful The Blair Witch Project. The Last Broadcast follows filmmaker David Leigh's (David Beard) exhaustive efforts through his current documentary project to find the actual facts surrounding the deaths of Fact or Fiction cable TV hosts Stephen Avcast (Stephen Avalos), Locus Wheeler (Lance Weiler), and their soundman Rein Clackin (Rein Clabbers) as they were filming a broadacst up in New Jersey's Pine Barren Forest searching for the infamous Jersey Devil. What David Leigh finds is a possible police conspricacy, a imbecillic scapegoat, a supernatural suspect, and a much bigger mystery at hand. What exactly did happen to the Fact or Fiction crew? The question is just as provocative as the movie itself. The film achieves a low-budget documentary aura that seduces the audience into the mobrid universe of Fact or Fiction and the Jersey Devil. Obvious cinematic liabilities are unexpectedly warped into stunningly intense film trappings, the excessievly montone delivery of David Leigh as the narrator, the sometimes excessive performances of the cast, the very shoddy quality of the picture, and the amateurish camerawork all give the Last Broadcast a solid breadth of realism that attracts the hesistant viewer into the film's comprehensive tapestry of homicidal manslaughter, paranormal intrigue, and omnious sinister death that beckons for solace and answers. This film is a tribute to the intelligent insight of directors Avalos and Weiler who have a achieved a radically new film style that exploits passionately personal storytelling over the Hollywood creativity crutch of stars, production values, and special effects. Accentuated by a startling ending moral denouncement, The Last Broadcast is a horror milestone that is most definitely too ahead of its time for viewer comfort. Despite all the several complaints about the films's unforeseen ending, the film remains true to its philosophical roots and standpoints, and it doesn't diminish itself by taking the easy and expected route. In the same elusive club of horror classics such as Hitchcock's Psycho, Carpenter's Halloween, and Romero's Night of the Living Dead, The Last Broadcast goes for the more plausiable and horrifying threat of normalty over more exaggerated means of rattling an audience. The all-too comforting surroundings of normal life are much more frightening than all the aliens, demons, and ominpotent maniacs you could think of. The Last Broadcast will be fondly remembered as a horror masterwork for decades to come. A must-see. As for the Last Broadcast DVD package, the widescreen format is first-rate with a knowledgeable director's commentary track, theatrical trailers, and a well-versed documentary on the legend of the Jersey Devil.P.S.

Saxelid ""Bookworm""","[1, 1]","For people like me, who grew up addicted to shows like In Search Of or Unsolved Mysteries, The Last Broadcast will offer some deliciously entertaining mockumentary moments of those paranormal reality shows. Those who want something that is 'real' had better look elsewhere.A couple of guys running a cable access show exploring weird happenings and legends (think Wayne's World mixed up with those Lone Gunmen from The X-Files) are ripped to shreads shortly after finishing their last broadcast (hey, that's the title!) which entailed a hunt for the Jersey Devil in the pine barrens of New Jersey. The soul surviving member of the party is found guilty of murder and dies in prison of 'mysterious' causes. This movie tells the whole, ugly story behind that last broadcast (hey, that's the title!).For awhile the movie almost works, jumping between blaming the misfit guide Jim Seward for the killings, but also hinting that, perhaps, the victims bumped into something other worldly in the woods. Something the documentarian character seems to want to go to any lengths to prove.Sadly the movie cannot contain itself in its chosen narrative format. In the closing minutes the point of view abruptly shifts from mockumentary to simple third person narrative filmmaking with such sudden sloppiness I had to skip back to make sense of what I had just seen. It is a poor excuse for a twist ending that will leave the viewer feeling cheated. Nonetheless the movie has its moments, it just isn't entirely successful with them.

512282,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00001WY85,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 5]","After many months of consideration, I finally decided to buy this movie.  I must say I was quite disappointed.  I wasn't expecting another Blair Witch Project, but I did expect more creepiness and more of an actual story.  Halfway through the movie, I noticed the time and wondered when the movie was really going to start.  The ending was somewhat acceptable though less than unforeseen, but overall this movie reminds me of a patchwork quilt that someone forgot to actually sew together into one whole object.  The documentary format was weakened by a droll, unemotional, monotonous narration; the interviewed subjects also do not reveal any real attachment to the story.  When the film starts, the viewer is informed that the following people are not actors; ""(at least, not very good ones)"" could easily have been appended to that opening statement.  The sequence of the action is also questionable.  There is too much jumping around from one place and setting to another, and several scenes are annoyingly replayed several times; I would rather have been given a more sequential presentation.  As for the film shot by the participants in the pine barrens, the attention to realism possibly goes too far.  The video is totally unviewable much more often that it should be.  The conversations on the tapes are often unintelligible, and there are few decent background perspectives by which the viewer can orient himself.  The story of the recreation of the mangled tape that turned up long after the events is well-done, but the descriptions of just how difficult it is to reconstruct the images grow tedious, and the tape's ultimate revelation is less than earth-shattering.It is important to note that this movie preceded the Blair Witch Project and is thus in no way a Blair Witch clone.

I live in New Jersey right outside Philadelphia and was pretty curious about a movie involving the New Jersey Devil. The first 80 minutes of this movie were pretty good. It was gritty and raw enough to be very  convincing. However, the suprise ending comes out of nowhere and really has  no place in the matter. Not only does it not make sense but it forces you  to discount everything you saw up to that point. Had the last few minutes  been cut off, maybe re-edited or something, they might have a cult classic  on their hands, instead this movie just comes up short.

512287,A367Q9VRWQZG7W,B00001WY85,Gavin B.,"[9, 14]","""Last Broadcast"" was released a full year before the ""Blair Witch Project"" release date, and upon seeing this film, the viewer can only conclude that this film was the source of the ideas behind ""Blair Witch.""  ""Last Broadcast"" is a far better film both technically and artistically. What's amazing is that Last Broadcast was shot for under $500. ""Blair Witch Project"" directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez did one thing  better than ""Last Broadcast"" directors: promote themselves and their film. ""Blair Witch"" directors Sanchez and Myrick knew how to hype their product using an internet campaign and eventually got widespread distribution for ""Blair Witch Project."" Had Stefan Alavos and Lance Weiler possessed that kind of marketing strategy, perhaps ""Last Broadcast"" would have been the sleeper hit movie that came out of nowhere. Unfortunately ""Last Broadcast"" came out of nowhere and stayed in nowhere, but thanks to verenrable cable networks like Sundance and IFC, this remarkable movie can still be seen on television, occasionally.The strength of ""Last Broadcast ""is that it's utterly believable. The characters in the film crew are intelligent (albeit; eccentric tekkies in the marginal subculture of contemporary infotainment television). The young men of the television crew are high tech savvy producers of a public access ""fact or fiction"" type of show. The crew members are a cross section of a generation who readily mastered the digital and internet technology, but ironically, explain the ambiguities of the real world in terms of paranormal science,esoteric rituals,urban legends and X-File conspiracy theories. These are smart men who like agents Scully and Mulder want to beleive that the truth is ""out there.""  Our misguided perception is that the truth is the source of all authority, but the search for truth often ends with a confrontation with a beast hidden beneath the veneer of ""truth.""The acting of the entire cast is so natural and spontaneous that it's hard to believe they aren't real people, unless you know the movie is a hoax. David Seward as the accused killer, resists an opportunity to portray Jim Suerd as an over-the-top caricature of a mass murderer. Instead, Jim Suerd is a brooding self obsessed psychic, not unlike any number of colorful characters and psychic charlatans you might encounter at a New Age seminar or even a Phish concert. Maybe he's manipulating you with his smoke and mirrors magic act, but otherwise Suerd is the sort of entertaining character that inhabits the margins of mainstream America, except for one personality flaw. Suerd takes himself too seriously and exhibits agressive behavior toward those who would ridicule his psychic talents. Prosecutors use Suerd's short-fuse to make a convincing case that he is an out of control lunatic.There are a number of red herrings that the prosecution was unable to resolve: How did Suerd manage to overpower four other people and commit the level of carnage at the crime scene? What happened to the crew member that simply disappeared leaving only a hat at the crime scene? How could Suerd commit the crime when he spent the evening in an internet relay chatroom set up inside his tent? The answer is lies in partially destroyed videotape that is left on the doorstep of the documentary film director. Or is the  answer really in the destoyed video tape, or is the tape just another red herring?...another faked or manipulated document to mask the idenity of the real killer.The final revelation of the truth by the Beard's narrator makes the ending of the movie even more unsettling. The narrator speaks of the nature of evil and how truth can be easily manipulated in the age of reality T.V. Reality is often not what it seems to be and the ""truth"" is elusive and operates under the laws of relativity. As we witness the disclosure of the ""real killer"", the truth is still ambiguous. With so many red herrings, is it possible that the ending is another clever deception by the killer?Perhaps many of the Amazon reviewers missed the subtle point of the ending. Those critics of the ""Last Broadcast"" have said that its ending isn't ""realistic."" The camera angles and wide shots in the last five minutes couldn't have been done by the just one person. That makes complete sense, if you beleive that the killer acted alone. I disagree with the single killer theory; indeed the final scene is compelling evidence of a more sinister scenario....the murderer had one or more accomplices.When I saw the final shot final wide angle camera shot of the narrator in the woods, I concluded that the ""killer"" was simply a pawn being manipulated by the real mastermind of the killings, whose idenity is never disclosed in the film... The actual mastermind of the killings was operating the second camera doing the tight shots, rooftop shots and wide angle shots that would have impossible for the documentarian to film in the last two scenes of the movie. The mastermind was filming his own documentary of the documentary and was cleverly manipulating even the final revelation of the killer by the documentarian! The killer's final coup d'grace is that when he shoots the final scene of his insane and babbling partner in crime, to prove he exploited at least one other person to do his bidding. Perhaps it was shot for the purpose of blackmail, but it's more likely he shot for the footage of as a homage to his own pure evil.So,who was the mastermind in these horrifying murders? Could it be that oddball, lip stick wearing, down-and out soap opera director, Sam Wells, who lurks in the background of the events? His scruffy appearance and bizzare personality make him my candidate for a guru of thrill kill cult.  Or maybe the overly ambitious and genial ""Fact or Fiction"" video editor, Tom Brunt, who disclosed his television career had taken the fast track since the killings? Or was it the the benign and supportive Dr. Dale Worstall, the killer's psychological counselor prior to the killings? His status as a psychologist would certainly benefit from being the treating psychologist to a notorious mass murderer. You can almost see the book deals and movie options coming in for Dr. Dale.The message of the ""Last Broadcast"" is ""trust no one."" In modern America it pays to be skeptical, particularly if someone tells you they have the ""truth.""  The truth is cheap and you can get as many versions of ""truth"", as reflected images in a house of mirrors. If you don't like one person's version of the ""facts"", change the channel, or surf over to a website where someone has an entirely different version of the ""truth"" that you can agree with. The ""truth"" is mediated by spin doctors, checkbook journalism, reality television, ""fact based"" movies, mockumentaries, supressed evidence, cult superstitions, out of context quotations, politcal and moral censors, press agents, rumor and heresay. With the right kind of media coverage, the same people who were gullible enough to beleive the ""weapons of mass destruction"" fantasy, can be convinced that boogeymen like Bigfoot and the New Jersey Devil are coming to get them. After all, a good tyrant always needs a boogeyman to blame everything on. This ultimate deception of tyrants and boggeymen,is they sucessfully convince the entire world that someone else is really the boogeyman.",5,A Thinking Man's Blair Witch Project,1108598400,"02 17,

The production quality of the movie looks like a student film.  I would compare it more to Curse of the Blair Witch (the Sci-Fi Channel documentary), but it looks like it was made on someone's home computer.  The movie is about a bunch of local cable personalities disappearing in the woods during their search for the Jersey Devil, however the film never talks about the legend behind the Jersey Devil.  Nothing is set up to help the audience grasp the horror behind what these characters are trying to find.  You also never see the terror that the characters go through.  You see one guy running away for a few seconds, but there is no moments of fear experienced in the movie.  I admit that it was still creepy at times, but knowing the legend would have made the movie interesting.  The ending was also quite corny, but I won't get into that.  If you enjoyed the Blair Witch Project, you should probably skip this movie.  If you did not understand what made Blair Witch great, then you will likely enjoy this film much better.

I had always wished The Blair Witch Project had followed the format taken by The Last Broadcast, a documentary which extensively utilizes the footage shot by the  three filmmakers (i.e., The Curse of the Blair Witch with the important  footage of The Blair Witch Project cut into it).  Unfortunately, The Last  Broadcast did not deliver.  I agree with those who say that the lack of  explanation about the Jersey Devil is a bad idea.  There were, however,  quite a few places in the film where I was rather creeped out, plus a few  spots in which they claimed important footage would be shown had me on my  the edge of my seat.The biggest problem with the movie is that it  suddenly decided to turn pretentious within the last few minutes.  It  wasn't enough the filmmakers make an entertaining film, rather they felt  they needed a message, so they shoehorned in a statement on the news media.  Of course, that isn't the worst of it.  The ending twist comes from out of  nowhere and makes absolutely no sense when taken in context of the rest of  the film.I also listened to the commentary on the DVD and found that the  filmmakers had a very self-important attitude that made me like the movie  even less.

The Last Broadcast is something like the Blair Witch Project, only I can stand, and like this one!PLOTA couple of friends do a public access show called ""fact or fiction"" and it's not a very good show. Even tho you don't exactly have ratings on public access, they know there show is losing popularity and come up with a cool idea to broadcast live from the Pine Barron's in New Jersey on the hunt for the myth of the Jersey Devil.They meet up with 2 new people they have never met to go on this trip. One is a sound expert, the other is a so called psychic.Well, that night out in the woods, something goes horribly wrong. Only one comes back alive and he is charged with the murder of his colleagues of that night. He then dies in prison under mysterious circumstances. Then this documentarien is investigating it (which is the whole theme of this movie) and tho the police and jury saw it as an open and shut case, the documentarian see's it in another way.Watch the film to find out if the suspect really did kill the crew of fact or fiction, or if something more mysterious has occurred.- end plot talkThe whole film is set up like it's shot on a home video camera, in which it pretty much was. It's like watching a documentary. When this film was over, it became and instant favorite for me.Now, somewhat almost ten years later, it's finally released on DVD, and I had to pick it up. I was very surprised with the bonus features about how this movie came about and how it was made. It was actually made using home video cameras, pretty much no budget, and conceived on a desktop computer! Thats pretty impressive to me how they did this thing. Then they refused to put it on film, because it was shot digitally, and they became the first people to broadcast screenings of this film by digital projection. So, it's the first of it's kind.Some of the other bonus features are a bit lame, but learning about how it was done, made, and released is pretty cool for almost no budget. This film was an independent movie that actually has succeeded and done well that would probably inspire amateur film makers of the world.I liked the movie when i first saw it, and i really appreciate it more now knowing how it was made and released etc...Don't be fooled by thinking it's a rip off of the Blair Witch tho, the Blair Witch Project ripped off this movie, so get your facts straight.It's an interesting documentary about a murder investigation, strange circumstances and Clue (Cluedo) like twists and turns to keep sending the outcome into a new spin just when you think you know who did it.",4,The Joisey Devil Made Me Do It,1107993600,"02 10, 2005",2005,3379,"['Ya', 'know', 'when', 'ya', 'go', 'video', 'store', 'hanging', 'out', 'see', 'few', 'movies', 'shop', 'attendant', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'grab', 'one', 'more', 'weekly', 'get', 'bargain', 'deals', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'anything', 'else', 'just', 'grab', 'something', 'hell', 'expecting', 'be', 'something', 'will', 'turn', 'off', 'halfway', 'through.Well', 'was', 'case', 'however', 'was', 'other', 'movies', 'i', 'was', 'wanting', 'see', 'where', 'disappointing', 'was', 'film', 'one', 'i', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'would', 'watch', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'lucky', 'find.I', 'first', 'found', 'VHS', 'store', 'only', 'had', 'one', 'copy', 'was', 'not', 'popular', 'film', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'quite', 'frankly', 'when', 'mentioned', 'something', 'being', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'cover', 'just', 'threw', 'down', 'disgust.But', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'Last', 'Broadcast', 'something', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'only', 'can', 'stand', 'one', 'PLOTA', 'couple', 'friends', 'do', 'public', 'access', 'show', 'called', 'fact', 'fiction', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'show', 'Even', 'do', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'have', 'ratings', 'public', 'access', 'know', 'show', 'losing', 'popularity', 'come', 'up', 'cool', 'idea', 'broadcast', 'live', 'Pine', 'Barron', 'New', 'Jersey', 'hunt', 'myth', 'Jersey', 'Devil.They', 'meet', 'up', '2', 'new', 'people', 'have', 'never', 'met', 'go', 'trip', 'One', 'sound', 'expert', 'other', 'so', 'called', 'psychic.Well', 'night', 'out', 'woods', 'something', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'Only', 'one', 'back', 'alive', 'charged', 'murder', 'colleagues', 'night', 'then', 'prison', 'mysterious', 'circumstances', 'Then', 'documentarien', 'investigating', 'whole', 'theme', 'movie', 'tho', 'police', 'jury', 'saw', 'open', 'shut', 'case', 'documentarian', 'see', 'way.Watch', 'film', 'find', 'out', 'suspect', 'really', 'did', 'kill', 'crew', 'fact', 'fiction', 'something', 'more', 'mysterious', 'occurred.-', 'end', 'plot', 'talkThe', 'whole', 'film', 'set', 'up', 'shot', 'home', 'video', 'camera', 'pretty', 'much', 'was', 'watching', 'documentary', 'When', 'film', 'was', 'over', 'became', 'instant', 'favorite', 'me.Now', 'somewhat', 'almost', 'ten', 'years', 'later', 'finally', 'released', 'DVD', 'had', 'pick', 'up', 'was', 'very', 'surprised', 'bonus', 'how', 'movie', 'came', 'about', 'how', 'was', 'made', 'was', 'actually', 'made', 'using', 'home', 'video', 'cameras', 'pretty', 'much', 'budget', 'conceived', 'desktop', 'computer', 'Thats', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'how', 'did', 'thing', 'Then', 'refused', 'put', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'digitally', 'became', 'first', 'people', 'broadcast', 'screenings', 'film', 'digital', 'projection', 'So', 'first', 'kind.Some', 'other', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'bit', 'lame', 'learning', 'how', 'was', 'done', 'made', 'released', 'pretty', 'cool', 'almost', 'budget', 'film', 'was', 'independent', 'movie', 'actually', 'succeeded', 'done', 'well', 'would', 'probably', 'inspire', 'amateur', 'film', 'makers', 'world.I', 'liked', 'movie', 'when', 'i', 'first', 'saw', 'i', 'really', 'appreciate', 'more', 'now', 'knowing', 'how', 'was', 'made', 'released', 'etc', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'thinking', 'rip', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'tho', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'ripped', 'off', 'movie', 'so', 'get', 'facts', 'straight.It', 'interesting', 'documentary', 'murder', 'investigation', 'strange', 'circumstances', 'Clue', 'Cluedo', 'twists', 'keep', 'sending', 'outcome', 'new', 'spin', 'just', 'when', 'think', 'know', 'who', 'did']",N/A

I watched BWP and my thoughts were, &quot;What's the big deal?&quot; (I also have a review  of BWP here as well). &quot;The Last Broadcast&quot; takes a little  while to get into, after the character set-ups, police interviews about Jim  Seward, etc. but then it gets more interesting when they begin to show the  &quot;actual&quot; documentary video of the guys going into the Pine  Barrens. The scare factor increases in the last 20 minutes of the film when  the video technician puts together the pieces of ravaged video that shows  up mysteriously after the murders,  which may shed more light on what  happened that night in the Pine Barrens. The twist ending of this film is  very strange and quite unexpected, so for this I consider &quot;The Last  Broadcast&quot; much more satisfying than BWP. Another thing I appreciated  about this film when compared to BWP was the fact they could make this film  without all the profanities so prominent in BWP. If you liked Blair Witch  Project, you'll probably like &quot;The Last Broadcast&quot; even better,  but if you didn't care for BWP, you probably WILL like &quot;The Last  Broadcast&quot;- it's a creepier and better-made film and I think it will  get it's due as a cult classic in years to come.",4,Better than BWP,959644800,"05 30, 2000",2000,1314,"['film', 'creeped', 'out', 'much', 'more', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'watched', 'BWP', 'thoughts', 'were', 'quot', 'What', 'big', 'deal', 'quot', 'also', 'have', 'review', 'BWP', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'quot', 'Last', 'Broadcast', 'quot', 'little', 'get', 'character', 'set-ups', 'police', 'interviews', 'Jim', 'Seward', 'etc', 'then', 'more', 'interesting', 'when', 'begin', 'show', 'quot', 'actual', 'quot', 'documentary', 'video', 'guys', 'going', 'Pine', 'Barrens', 'scare', 'factor', 'increases', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'film', 'when', 'video', 'technician', 'together', 'pieces', 'ravaged', 'video', 'up', 'mysteriously', 'murders', 'may', 'shed', 'more', 'light', 'what', 'happened', 'night', 'Pine', 'Barrens', 'twist', 'ending', 'film', 'very', 'strange', 'quite', 'unexpected', 'so', 'consider', 'quot', 'Last', 'Broadcast', 'quot', 'much', 'more', 'satisfying', 'BWP', 'thing', 'appreciated', 'film', 'when', 'compared', 'BWP', 'was', 'fact', 'could', 'make', 'film', 'profanities', 'so', 'prominent', 'BWP', 'liked', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'quot', 'Last', 'Broadcast', 'quot', 'even', 'better', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'BWP', 'probably', 'WILL', 'quot', 'Last', 'Broadcast', 'quot', 'creepier', 'better-made', 'film', 'think', 'will', 'get', 'due', 'cult', 'classic', 'years', 'come']",N/A
512301,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00001WY85,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 2]","The Last Broadcast (Stefan Avalos and Lance Weiler, 1998)The Last Broadcast would probably have slipped into obscurity were it not widely considered the film that inspired The Blair Witch Project. Like the erroneous comparisons that remain between The Sixth Sense and The Others, the two films share surface similarities, but the mechanisms that drive each are different. Unfortunately, like The Others (one of the best films of 2001), The Last Broadcast universally suffers in comparison on the surface level, but has much more working beneath the surface. Once again, my hypothesis that subtlety is wasted on the masses rears its ugly head.The Last Broadcast is a documentary being put together by David Leigh (David Beard, last seen in Strange Brew, who also narrated Avalos and Weiler's ""The True Legend of the Jersey Devil"") about the 1996 Jersey Devil Murders, in which two hosts of a bad local cable show, Steven Avkast and Locus Wheeler (played by Avalos and Weiler), hire two South Jersey locals, soundman Rein Clackin (Rein Clabbers) and guide/psychic Jim Suerd (Jim Seward; you can see where they went with the names, yes?) to take them into the Jersey Pine Barrens in search of the legendary Jersey Devil. Suerd emerges from the Pine Barrens a few days later alone; Wheeler and Clackin's bodies are soon recovered, while Avkast's remains are only large sprays of blood on the snow. Filmaker Leigh is convinced of Suerd's innocence, and sets out making The Last Broadcast to prove this.Okay, you see the parallels with the Blair Witch Project. A fictional tale (though the legend of the Jersey Devil really does exist, unlike that of the Blair Witch) being presented in a mockumentary, with lots of supposedly live candid footage. Somehow, though, I missed all the stuff in BWP about the aftermath, and how it led to the making of the film-outside-the-film. That alone should still film-to-film comparisons (though piece-to-piece are still warranted), not that it ever does. In order to appreciate The Last Broadcast for what it is, it must be taken on its own merits.And it does have many merits. If you tuned in halfway through, you'd believe you were watching Forensic Files on CourtTV rather than a mystery film. The documentary atmosphere here is spot-on. In the latter half of the film, when Leigh hires a professional film restorer (Michelle Pulaski) to reconstruct a destroyed videocassette, there were times when _I_ thought I was watching Forensic Files (and I knew I was watching a mystery film). It's all quite wonderfully constructed (and perhaps better compared to the hour-long Blair Witch Project documentary special that aired on the Sci-Fi Channel before the film's release; it has a whole lot more in common with the latter half of The Last Broadcast than BWP ever did).Where the film may go wrong, though, is in the last ten minutes. The jury's still out on this. I've read reviews both praising and criticizing the ending, though far more of the latter. I waffle between thinking it destroys the tone of the film and puts a decent ironic cap on it; I think the main problem is that it feels like it should have been a piece of a different film. But it is a piece of a different effective, very eerie film.Enjoyable on many levels. Even if you didn't like the Blair Witch Project, don't let the comparisons put you off; this is worth seeing. ****",4,Excellent when taken on its own merits.,1067904000,"11 4, 2003",2003,3377,"['Last', 'Broadcast', 'Stefan', 'Avalos', 'Lance', 'Weiler', '1998', 'Last', 'Broadcast', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'slipped', 'obscurity', 'were', 'not', 'widely', 'considered', 'film', 'inspired', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'erroneous', 'comparisons', 'remain', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Others', 'two', 'films', 'share', 'surface', 'similarities', 'mechanisms', 'drive', 'are', 'different', 'Unfortunately', 'Others', 'one', 'best', 'films', '2001', 'Last', 'Broadcast', 'universally', 'comparison', 'surface', 'level', 'much', 'more', 'working', 'beneath', 'surface', 'Once', 'again', 'hypothesis', 'subtlety', 'wasted', 'masses', 'ugly', 'head.The', 'Last', 'Broadcast', 'documentary', 'being', 'put', 'together', 'David', 'Leigh', 'David', 'Beard', 'last', 'seen', 'Strange', 'Brew', 'who', 'also', 'narrated', 'Avalos', 'Weiler', 'True', 'Legend', 'Jersey', 'Devil', '1996', 'Jersey', 'Devil', 'Murders', 'two', 'hosts', 'bad', 'local', 'cable', 'show', 'Steven', 'Avkast', 'Locus', 'Wheeler', 'played', 'Avalos', 'Weiler', 'hire', 'two', 'South', 'Jersey', 'locals', 'soundman', 'Rein', 'Clackin', 'Rein', 'Clabbers', 'guide/psychic', 'Jim', 'Suerd', 'Jim', 'Seward', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'went', 'names', 'yes', 'take', 'Jersey', 'Pine', 'Barrens', 'search', 'legendary', 'Jersey', 'Devil', 'Suerd', 'Pine', 'Barrens', 'few', 'days', 'later', 'alone', 'Wheeler', 'Clackin', 'bodies', 'are', 'soon', 'recovered', 'Avkast', 'remains', 'are', 'only', 'large', 'sprays', 'blood', 'snow', 'Filmaker', 'Leigh', 'convinced', 'Suerd', 'innocence', 'out', 'making', 'Last', 'Broadcast', 'prove', 'this.Okay', 'see', 'parallels', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'A', 'fictional', 'tale', 'legend', 'Jersey', 'Devil', 'really', 'exist', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'being', 'presented', 'mockumentary', 'lots', 'supposedly', 'live', 'candid', 'footage', 'Somehow', 'missed', 'stuff', 'BWP', 'aftermath', 'how', 'led', 'making', 'film-outside-the-film', 'alone', 'should', 'still', 'film-to-film', 'comparisons', 'piece-to-piece', 'are', 'still', 'warranted', 'not', 'ever', 'order', 'appreciate', 'Last', 'Broadcast', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'taken', 'own', 'merits.And', 'have', 'many', 'merits', 'tuned', 'halfway', ""'d"", 'believe', 'were', 'watching', 'Forensic', 'Files', 'CourtTV', 'rather', 'mystery', 'film', 'documentary', 'atmosphere', 'here', 'spot-on', 'latter', 'half', 'film', 'when', 'Leigh', 'professional', 'film', 'restorer', 'Michelle', 'Pulaski', 'reconstruct', 'destroyed', 'videocassette', 'were', 'times', 'when', '_I_', 'thought', 'was', 'watching', 'Forensic', 'Files', 'knew', 'was', 'watching', 'mystery', 'film', 'quite', 'wonderfully', 'constructed', 'perhaps', 'better', 'compared', 'hour-long', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'documentary', 'special', 'aired', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', 'film', 'release', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'common', 'latter', 'half', 'Last', 'Broadcast', 'BWP', 'ever', 'did', '.Where', 'film', 'may', 'go', 'wrong', 'though', 'last', 'ten', 'minutes', 'jury', 'still', 'out', ""'ve"", 'read', 'reviews', 'praising', 'criticizing', 'ending', 'far', 'more', 'latter', 'waffle', 'thinking', 'tone', 'film', 'decent', 'ironic', 'cap', 'think', 'main', 'problem', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'piece', 'different', 'film', 'piece', 'different', 'effective', 'very', 'eerie', 'film.Enjoyable', 'many', 'levels', 'Even', 'did', ""n't"", 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'comparisons', 'put', 'off', 'worth', 'seeing', '****']",N/A
512302,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B00001WY85,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[5, 6]","A bunch of media doofuses trek into remote woods in search of an old and horrific local legend - and are never seen alive again.  By now, ""Last Broadcast"" will go down (for those few who've seen and remember it) as that other mock-documentary project about the supernatural.  I wanted to give this flick a chance given how I've seen ""Blair Witch"", and not only does ""Broadcast"" fail by comparison, but fails to escape comparison - painfully ironic given that ""Broadcast"" is actually the older of the two movies.WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT: ""Broadcast"" is a (wholly fictitious) documentary about the 1995 murders of several men who ran a local cable-access show called ""Fact or Fiction"".  When ratings sag, Steve Avkast, Rein Clackin & Locus Wheeler decide to devote a show to the mysterious ""Jersey Devil"".  With the ""help"" of a local magician and (alleged) psychic named Jim Suerd, our trio make a winter's journey deep into the remote ""Pine Barrens"".  While there, they have their cameras and internet access - they're connected to the outside world, but not protected by it.  Only Suerd will emerge alive from the Barrens - luckless, he will be convicted of the brutal murders of two of the others.  No body is found of Avkast, precluding feckless prosecutors from pursuing a triple bill against Suerd.  (Avkast's hat and gobs of his blood leave little doubt of his fate.)  Lacking a confession, prosecutors seal Suerd's fate with his blood spattered clothes, but largely on the strength of preserved video footage showing him as randomly violent and (most importantly) the guy leading the group deeper into the barrens.  The documentary begins after Suerd's mysterious death in prison - where he was to serve consecutive life sentences.  When the documentarian receives battered remains of an additional video tape - the actual final broadcast of the ""Final Broadcast"" crew - producer David Leigh switches gears.  Reconstructed footage critically undermines the timeline advanced by prosecutors at Suerd's trial, forcing Leigh to rethink the events leading up to the horrific multiple murders of the Pine Barrens, and the very meaning of such legends as ""The Jersey Devil"" in the modern digital age.  (The flick was released in '98, based on events occurring in '95.)WHAT GOES WRONG: overshadowed by ""Blair Witch"", ""Broadcast"" actually derives its inspiration from two other movies - but naming them would spoil the ending (which the producers obviously consider a real twist).  ""Blair"" and ""Broadcast"" have similar sounding premises but each takes a different turn - one that informs the superiority of ""Blair"".  While ""Blair"" just gave us the raw footage of 2 films (the documentary that Donahue was shooting AND the DAT she shot documenting her journey), ""Final"" is structured like a documentary itself - it's the single-minded product of Leigh's vision, complete with his voice-overs and his perspective.  ""Final"" lacks that sense of natural transition from reasoned observation to mad desperation that we enjoyed in ""Blair"" as our heroes realized that they had become trapped in their own project.  ""Final"" has Leigh directing us as much as his film - telling us what we were to think, what direction to pursue, what to expect.  The story has some chills, but mostly that's undermined by its slickness - it looks produced rather than nurtured, with some computer graphics, and actors who bring admirable vigor to their characters without escaping the thin dossiers created for them.  (Suerd is a laughable, if harmless idiot who thinks he really is a magician; Avkast, half the visible face of ""Fact or Fiction"" is a self-important hack desperate to save his stupid show, even though cable access slots are supposed to be given on a first-come basis; Wheeler & Clackin are just a couple of loudmouths who mercilessly ridicule anybody who takes their show seriously.) ""Blair"" excelled in its ability to show the nuanced changes suffered by its characters, but there's no nuance here.If anything, ""Broadcast"" probably enjoyed, rather than suffered exposure to ""Blair"", offering an alternative to anybody turned off by the latter film's shameless promotion (vindicated by ""Book of Shadows"") or otherwise made into a ""Blair Hater"".  Unlike ""Blair"" which relied on a steady stream of shocks, ""Broadcast"" leads up to a twist ending, one which requires suspension of our disbelief, and shamelessly relies on our reflexive skepticism of the media (and just about everybody else).  Fans of this movie must think that if it's less popular than ""Blair"", it must be more worthwhile than that movie, more of a thinking-man's version of that movie, even though it doesn't evince any more thinking of its own.",2,"Hardly a thinking-man's ""Blair Witch""",1162166400,"10 30, 2006",2006,4695,"['bunch', 'media', 'doofuses', 'trek', 'remote', 'woods', 'search', 'old', 'horrific',

When all of them except the psychic are brutally murdered he becomes the chief suspect and is convicted of the crime. The documentary filmmaker behind ""The Last Broadcast"" uses video footage shot by the hosts of ""Fact or Fiction"" in reconstructing what exactly happened.Made before ""The Blair Witch Project"" but without the studio hype behind it ""The Last Broadcast"" was shot and put together for less than $900.00. The project is very convincing and the filmmakers do a terrific job with the story. While the denouncement at the conclusion of the film is shot differently than the previous faux documentary style footage the film works very well. It seems many viewers were puzzled by the change it style it was dictated by the change in the story direction. I found the film to be equally as disquieting and creepy as ""The Blair Witch Project"" was before all the media frenzy that surrounded that film.The DVD comes with a number of featurettes covering everything from the conception of the project to post production and marketing. Surprisingly the film's directors (who also star in it by the way) managed to put this on the indie circuit without transferring the digital images to film.
