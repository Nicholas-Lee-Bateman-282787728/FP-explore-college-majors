As a bass player who fingers/plucks the strings, the method of slapping the guitar with the side of your thumb was completely foreign (although I've since learned that many bass players use this method - notably Flea from The Red Hot Chili Peppers), as I grew up modeling my playing style (if not skill level) after Geddy Lee of Rush.  Even for one such as myself who had NEVER played this style before, the video takes you slowly enough through the elemental steps of how to slap, how to create a slap rhythm, and how to build on these rhythms to add to the other instruments in the band so that you don't get lost.  I'm sure that even with a small amount of practice, this method could be easily learned through the video.  Unfortunately, as a 39-yr old adult with a full-time job, I don't have time for practice and one 2-hr stint with the video made my thumb hurt for over a month.  However, this is my issue and not the fault of the video.  Seems to me that a teenager/young adult with time on his/her hands could very quickly master the exercises and excel in this method.Bottom line is this is an exceptional video.  Only drawback is the $40 sticker price - however it appears that this price range is not abnormal for music instruction videos, so...",4,Very Informative,1243296000,"05 26, 2009",2009,1509,"['video', 'be', 'straight', ""'80"", 'still', 'relevant', 'Bass', 'Guitar', 'players', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'push', 'playing', 'style', 'different', 'and/or', 'more', 'challenging', 'areas', 'just', 'playing', 'whole', 'quarter', 'notes', 'garage', 'band', 'bass', 'player', 'who', 'strings', 'method', 'slapping', 'guitar', 'side', 'thumb', 'was', 'completely', 'foreign', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'many', 'bass', 'players', 'use', 'method', 'notably', 'Flea', 'Red', 'Hot', 'Chili', 'Peppers', 'grew', 'up', 'modeling', 'playing', 'style', 'not', 'skill', 'level', 'Geddy', 'Lee', 'Rush', 'Even', 'one', 'such', 'myself', 'who', 'had', 'NEVER', 'played', 'style', 'video', 'slowly', 'enough', 'elemental', 'steps', 'how', 'slap', 'how', 'create', 'slap', 'rhythm', 'how', 'build', 'rhythms', 'add', 'other', 'instruments', 'band', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'lost', ""'m"", 'sure', 'even', 'small', 'amount', 'practice', 'method', 'could', 'be', 'easily', 'learned', 'video', 'Unfortunately', '39-yr', 'old', 'adult', 'full-time', 'job', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'practice', 'one', '2-hr', 'stint', 'video', 'made', 'thumb', 'hurt', 'month', 'However', 'issue', 'not', 'fault', 'video', 'teenager/young', 'adult', 'time', 'his/her', 'hands', 'could', 'very', 'quickly', 'master', 'exercises', 'excel', 'method.Bottom', 'line', 'exceptional', 'video', 'Only', 'drawback', '40', 'sticker', 'price', 'however', 'price', 'range', 'not', 'abnormal', 'music', 'instruction', 'videos', 'so']",The Slap Bass Program VHS

I have several basses as well, yet this style and the sound kept eluding me. This DVD, although the production appears to be dated (not only the hair style, but the DVD quality as well - not exactly HD) is the only one that let me understand the method and finally hear the bass ""talk"". An excellent resource. I wish the author would try to update this DVD, since there is still not a single real competitor and the demand is out there.

This VHS brought me to a higher level and I kept at it and played and practiced so much until I mastered his many segments that I would jump up and down and run through the house in sheer joy when I finally got it down! You have to watch carefully and practice, practice, practice. Now, I have mastered triplets and octaves and lots of innovating and creative pathways brought out by the video. I like the way the course is presented-he shows you variations and later puts it all together with his band. I am so serious here-I have improved so much because of this video. I cannot express enough gratitude for his expertise. Now I practice and practice.
