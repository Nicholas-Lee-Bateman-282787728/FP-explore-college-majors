27516,A35QF1GDLAFYCL,078060718X,"A. Calabrese ""othernj""","[3, 5]","I caught this film recently on the SyFy Channel.  I thought it gave a fair representation of a particular ""Christian"" eschatology, namely the 19th & 20th century phenomena of the ""born again believer"" and their obsession, over everything else Christian, on ""The Rapture.""  Mimi Rogers, as Sharon, gives a fine performance as an obsessed pleasure feeling sex addict who comes to see the emptiness of her life.  Sharon works at a dead end job as an 411 operator.  While cruising with her friend Vic, played by Patrick Bauchau, ever on the prowl for swingers at airport lounges, she meets a couple, the woman who has a strange tattoo on her back, of The Pearl.  Obviously a reference to the parable of Jesus and the story of the ""Pearl of Great Price.""  One day while eavesdropping on her Christian co-workers she hears them speaking of ""The Pearl.""  She is visited by two fundamentalists who leave her a copy of the New Testament.  She converts a former sex partner, Randy, played by David Duchovny.  There is also a prophet, a young boy, who I think is her bosses' son who predicts the near end of the world.  Well things go swimmingly for Sharon and Randy.  They have a daughter and all is good in the world.  But, for how long?  Not very long.  Randy, is murdered by a disgruntled former employee at his place of business.  Sharon gets a vision to go to the desert with the daughter to await the Rapture.  Well, they are befriended by a local sheriff, but are on the verge of starvation.  Sharon kills her daughter to send her to heaven faster, and obvious reference to Abraham and Issac or Dylan's Highway 61.  Anyway, I will not ruin the ending.  I liked the movie, because despite its faults it gives a fair portrayal of belief built on feeling, which is what drove Sharon all along, whether sinner or saint.  And this analogy can be used for religion, politics, really anything in life.  For an independent film, not too bad.  Why it was shown on the SyFy Channel is beyond me, it more properly belongs on the Trinity Network, though I doubt the pretty descriptive sex scenes in the beginning of the film would pass muster.",3,A PRETTY FAIR DEPICTION OF A PARTICULAR FORM OF CHRISTIANITY,1256601600,"10 27, 2009",2009,2128,"['caught', 'film', 'recently', 'SyFy', 'Channel', 'thought', 'gave', 'fair', 'representation', 'particular', 'Christian', 'eschatology', 'namely', '19th', '20th', 'century', 'phenomena', 'born', 'again', 'believer', 'obsession', 'everything', 'else', 'Christian', 'Rapture', 'Mimi', 'Rogers', 'Sharon', 'fine', 'performance', 'obsessed', 'pleasure', 'feeling', 'sex', 'addict', 'who', 'see', 'emptiness', 'life', 'Sharon', 'dead', 'end', 'job', '411', 'operator', 'cruising', 'friend', 'Vic', 'played', 'Patrick', 'Bauchau', 'ever', 'prowl', 'swingers', 'airport', 'lounges', 'couple', 'woman', 'who', 'strange', 'tattoo', 'back', 'Pearl', 'Obviously', 'reference', 'parable', 'Jesus', 'story', 'Pearl', 'Great', 'Price', 'One', 'day', 'eavesdropping', 'Christian', 'co-workers', 'speaking', 'Pearl', 'visited', 'two', 'fundamentalists', 'who', 'leave', 'copy', 'New', 'Testament', 'former', 'sex', 'partner', 'Randy', 'played', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'also', 'prophet', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'think', 'bosses', 'son', 'who', 'near', 'end', 'world', 'Well', 'things', 'go', 'swimmingly', 'Sharon', 'Randy', 'have', 'daughter', 'good', 'world', 'how', 'long', 'Not', 'very', 'long', 'Randy', 'murdered', 'disgruntled', 'former', 'employee', 'place', 'business', 'Sharon', 'vision', 'go', 'desert', 'daughter', 'await', 'Rapture', 'Well', 'are', 'befriended', 'local', 'sheriff', 'are', 'verge', 'starvation', 'Sharon', 'daughter', 'send', 'heaven', 'faster', 'obvious', 'reference', 'Abraham', 'Issac', 'Dylan', 'Highway', '61', 'Anyway', 'will', 'not', 'ruin', 'ending', 'liked', 'movie', 'faults', 'fair', 'portrayal', 'belief', 'built', 'feeling', 'what', 'drove', 'Sharon', 'along', 'sinner', 'saint', 'analogy', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'religion', 'politics', 'really', 'anything', 'life', 'independent', 'film', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'Why', 'was', 'shown', 'SyFy', 'Channel', 'more', 'properly', 'belongs', 'Trinity', 'Network', 'doubt', 'pretty', 'descriptive', 'sex', 'scenes', 'beginning', 'film', 'would', 'pass', 'muster']",Rapture VHS
27517,A28NIXW8PAJEYA,078060718X,Adrian Heathcote,"[9, 12]","Michael Tolkin, the writer and director of this film has acheived something truly remarkable: he has made an astonishing modern tragedy from the pat phrases - usually so mind-numbingly banal, even infantile - of  Born-Again Christianity. He does this by treating it all with a surprising  unflinching respect, allowing us to grasp the world from within that closed  system of beliefs, never stooping to condescension. Tolkin asks the simple  question: what if the day of judgement were to come soon - and exactly in  the way that Fundamentalists believe it will - what would we do? Or more  importantly, what should we think about the nature of God's bargain with  the world? (If Abraham had had to sacrifice Isaac, would he still have been  able to love God? Or would he have cursed him?)Out of this Tolkin  manages to wring a truly profound tragic meditation on the nature of faith  and sacrifice, all set against the most bland, low-mimetic, presentation of  the world imaginable. Mimi Rodgers is extraordinary and deserved an award.  But the greatest star must be the script.

27518,A13QNGUB9IYTY4,078060718X,"A Hermit ""J.Hamric""","[16, 43]","There isn't much to save this movie. People are upset with its portrayal of a born-again Christian, but the hard, sad truth is, MANY people are like this. They live empty, shallow lives, get bored, turn around, preach to everybody, fall by the wayside, and wind up disillusioned with their new-found faith. And they wind up worse than before. Very typical.People call this a slap in the face of Christianity, due to its portrayal of a believer, but really, it hurls the slap in the direction of people who don't believe as Christians do. It is annoying. Annoying, also, is the boy's constant referral of the final book of the New Testament as ""the book of Revelations."" If you actually LOOK at the text, you'll see it's just called ""Revelation."" No ""S."" This irks me. A genuine sign of lack of comprehension, is adding a final ""S"" to titles that are written in the singular. I see it all the time. As I do here.And the writer of the film says War is the First Horseman. Actually, the leading horse is white, a false peace, leading up to war.But the general message of this film is, only a few of the billions of people on Earth will wind up in Paradise. God, in His infinite wisdom, keeps pumping more and more people into a corrupt, over-crowded world, hoping one day he might get it right, creating the same flawed beings over and over, but turning his back on them when they stumble.A disturbing thing in this film is, I believe, a very realistic depiction of the psychological abuse the youngsters experience at the hands of the pious. The born-again's roots are not deep enough to take hold, as per the parable in the Gospel, and the innocent pay. The psychobabble of the mother talking about God taking them, the mother and daughter, up to Heaven, to be with the husband, who is the girl's father, and being left to look like fools when it doesn't happen, which has ALWAYS been the case with stories of the Second Coming, are, of course, what are expected to happen here. The woman looked like Linus Van Pelt, in his annual camp-out in the pumpkin patch, awaiting the ""Great Pumpkin."" This has happened many, many times in the real world, and it leaves people with egg on their face every time.I think my biggest problem with this film is, it leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth, so to speak. The doubters are seen as cynical, and the believers are seen as a secret society, and the main character is a bit of a loose cannon, who looks for God, can't find Him, suffers disappointment after disappointment, committing illegal, immoral acts along the way, and finally being taken to the gate of Heaven, just for God to say ""Nah, I don't think so,""  and leave her in the ""Outer Darkness"" to look in from the outside, forever.It's a propaganda film, and a bad one, at that.A little post-script, many weeks after writing this review: I would like to know what's so ""not helpful"" about the above review. I tell in it why I didn't like the movie. Maybe because I have criticized ""Christians"" as being pious and lacking in reading and comprehension skills?",1,A REAL TURKEY,1167868800,"01 4, 2007",2007,3057,"[""n't"", 'much', 'save', 'movie', 'People', 'are', 'upset', 'portrayal', 'born-again', 'Christian', 'hard', 'sad', 'truth', 'MANY', 'people', 'are', 'live', 'empty', 'shallow', 'lives', 'get', 'bored', 'turn', 'around', 'preach', 'everybody', 'fall', 'wayside', 'wind', 'up', 'disillusioned', 'new-found', 'faith', 'wind', 'up', 'worse', 'before', 'Very', 'typical.People', 'call', 'slap', 'face', 'Christianity', 'due', 'portrayal', 'believer', 'really', 'hurls', 'slap', 'direction', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Christians', 'do', 'annoying', 'Annoying', 'also', 'boy', 'constant', 'referral', 'final', 'book', 'New', 'Testament', 'book', 'Revelations', 'actually', 'LOOK', 'text', ""'ll"", 'see', 'just', 'called', 'Revelation', 'S.', 'genuine', 'sign', 'lack', 'comprehension', 'adding', 'final', 'S', 'titles', 'are', 'written', 'singular', 'see', 'time', 'do', 'here.And', 'writer', 'film', 'War', 'First', 'Horseman', 'Actually', 'leading', 'horse', 'white', 'false', 'peace', 'leading', 'up', 'war.But', 'general', 'message', 'film', 'only', 'few', 'billions', 'people', 'Earth', 'will', 'wind', 'up', 'Paradise', 'God', 'infinite', 'wisdom', 'pumping', 'more', 'more', 'people', 'corrupt', 'over-crowded', 'world', 'hoping', 'one', 'day', 'might', 'get', 'right', 'creating', 'same', 'flawed', 'beings', 'turning', 'back', 'when', 'stumble.A', 'disturbing', 'thing', 'film', 'believe', 'very', 'realistic', 'depiction', 'psychological', 'abuse', 'youngsters', 'experience', 'hands', 'pious', 'born-again', 'roots', 'are', 'not', 'deep', 'enough', 'take', 'hold', 'parable', 'Gospel', 'innocent', 'pay', 'psychobabble', 'mother', 'talking', 'God', 'taking', 'mother', 'daughter', 'up', 'Heaven', 'be', 'husband', 'who', 'girl', 'father', 'being', 'left', 'look', 'fools', 'when', ""n't"", 'happen', 'ALWAYS', 'been', 'case', 'stories', 'Second', 'Coming', 'are', 'course', 'what', 'are', 'expected', 'happen', 'here', 'woman', 'looked', 'Linus', 'Van', 'Pelt', 'annual', 'camp-out', 'pumpkin', 'patch', 'awaiting', 'Great', 'Pumpkin', 'happened', 'many', 'many', 'times', 'real', 'world', 'people', 'egg', 'face', 'time.I', 'think', 'biggest', 'problem', 'film', 'bad', 'taste', 'mouth', 'so', 'speak', 'doubters', 'are', 'seen', 'cynical', 'believers', 'are', 'seen', 'secret', 'society', 'main', 'character', 'bit', 'loose', 'cannon', 'who', 'God', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'Him', 'suffers', 'disappointment', 'disappointment', 'committing', 'illegal', 'immoral', 'acts', 'way', 'finally', 'being', 'taken', 'gate', 'Heaven', 'just', 'God', 'say', 'Nah', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'leave', 'Outer', 'Darkness', 'look', 'outside', 'forever.It', 'propaganda', 'film', 'bad', 'one', 'that.A', 'little', 'post-script', 'many', 'weeks', 'writing', 'review', 'would', 'like', 'know', 'what', 'so', 'not', 'helpful', 'above', 'review', 'tell', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'movie', 'Maybe', 'have', 'criticized', 'Christians', 'being', 'pious', 'lacking', 'reading', 'comprehension', 'skills']",Rapture VHS

Lees,"[5, 34]","Without even the camp awfulness of bad sci-fi or the risible portentiousness of the Cecil B DeMill epics, The Rapture is a strong contender for the title of worst film ever made.  The acting is third rate (you can practically see the actors trying to stifle yawns as they lurch mechanically through the wooden script), the concept trite beyond belief, and the conclusion almost (but, sadly, not quite) comic.  Anyone with an IQ greater than their hat size is unlikely to enjoy this film.  It is, in short, Christian schlock as only Hollywood can make it.  The tedium of the religious content comes from the total lack of imagination with which it is treated.  Whereas an atheist can find something of artistic interest in Goethe's Faust, even a born again type is unlikely to find much to write home about in this terrible story of a woman who moves from one shallow life (a &quot;sex addict&quot;) to another (a &quot;born again&quot;), who loses her husband and then feels compelled by her god to shoot her daughter (wasn't there something in the Christian philosophy about not killing?  I guess that got lost somewhere along the way).  Just when the film presents the (slender) possibility that a critique of religious extremism and emotional pain might be on offer, the film lurches to a conclusion in which the end of the world arrives (but not soon enough to spare us from this film!) and the protagonist's narrow little world of gods and heavens is revealed to be (of course) true after all.  This film is a complete waste of time all around, without a single redeeming feature.

As the story begins we meet Sharon, played by Mimi Rogers, a bored telephone operator who finds excitement by having sexual encounters with strangers. Slowly, she finds these sexual games less fulfilling and at the same time begins to notice that people around her, particularly her colleagues, are finding solace in their belief that the ""Second Coming"" of Christ is imminent. She then becomes torn between her old life that offers temporary solace and the new one that seems to offer spiritual fulfillment. Finally she, along with a past lover Randy, played by David Duchovny, marry and join this group and are ""reborn"". This is just the beginning of a long road of belief, tragedy, belief and disillusionment. For me it reminded me of the popular question, ""Why do bad things happen to good people?"" and generally how much can an pious individual take before questioning the actions of God or the universe. The final scenes of this film are earth shattering in every sense of that phrase. This is one of those films that you will continue to think about long after it is over.

Things begin to change when she begins having re-occuring dreams of a beautiful pearl which somehow brings her brief moments of peace and tranquility. And so begins Sharon surreal spiritual odyssey in search of the ""Will of God"" eventually leading to her embracing the Christian faith. Her new set of beliefs seem to work quite well for awhile. She falls in love with Randy (David Duchovny), marries and is blessed with a little girl. Life is good.However as we all know ""God's ways are not our own."" When things begin to go horribly wrong (Randy is murdered) Sharon's most basic assumptions concerning God's love and gift of salvation are challenged as she ponders the question, 'If God loves me why doesn't he answer my prayers?' When Sharon finally gets her wish and 'The Rapture' occurs she must decide once and for all where she wants to spend eternity. Here the film has its finest moment and makes its deepest impact.This has to be one of the most confusing, convoluted, unrealistic views of evangelical Christian fundamentalism ever presented on film. If it wasn't for the subject matter which has always both frightened and fascinated me, I wouldn't have been able to finish watching.

If nothing else, you will find yourself shaking your head in disbelief.  Michael Tolkin is a fantastic screenwriter/director although I don't know exactly what he intended for us to walk away with from this film but it's a powerful work nonetheless & a very difficult film to review.Mimi Rogers is, quite simply, captivating in her role as a bored telephone operator seeking deeper meaning in her life outside of work & the illicit activties. Eventually, she finds a religious sect who preach firmly about the end of time. It would seem her life is about ready to turn around. She marries a man who also accepts her faith, has a beautiful daughter, & lives the life that most only dream about.After the tragic death of her husband, she is beckoned to the desert with her young daughter in where her descent into madness is set. From there on, we get the full, almost sinister treatment which will ultimately lead to some very tragic consequences.The Rapture really grabs it's viewer by the horns & won't let go. The entire film experience is one not soon forgotten irregardless of whether you follow any specific religious guidelines or not. I found myself in tears by the end of the film & even surprisingly laughing at times at some of the near satyrical dialogue. This is really divulging a lot here as I was brought up in the Protestant church & I'm sure no one I attended sunday school with would approve of such a film.If you are looking for a film which will garner much discussion, look no further. The Rapture will draw heated debates from Christians/Non-Christians alike. Again, I'm not sure what the writer's intentions were but I do know that the script  dares to venture where few others ever would attempt & I don't think Mimi Rogers was ever blessed with a role quite as meaty again.

She realizes that her life has no purpose and leads her nowhere and she turns to a religious sect for spiritual guidance...It's been several weeks since I saw the film and I am still not sure what it was, a riveting dark drama about searching for faith, accepting spiritual awakening, preparing yourself for the second coming of Christ and for Apocalypses now or the ridiculous piece of trash. I think it could be both and it depends on how you feel toward the Christianity, the possibility of undergoing a religious conversion, and the readiness to sacrifice the most precious that you have to prove your faith and love for God. It also depends on how you feel about the dialogs in the movie - the quote that I've chosen for the title of this review may give you an idea of what to expect.What I am sure of is that Mimi Rogers gave a fine performance, and she is a reason enough to see ""The Rapture"".

I was dragging people to see this film in the theater and have introduced dozens of others to the video and DVD versions.  Released in 1991, ""The Rapture"" is a bold and uncompromising picture--one that deserves to be recognized as a classic.  Rarely will you see a film tackle the subject of religion so fearlessly, so relentlessly, and so literally.  I suppose that's why some people have stayed away.  Religion is not a very fashionable topic.  Some people stay away for fear of being preached to, while many religious supporters get offended if the film is anything less than pious.  Now, you will see many one star reviews claiming this to be Anti-Christian heresy--but I have many Christian friends who have embraced this film as an intelligent and powerful study of faith and commitment.""The Rapture"" starts out with Mimi Rogers living a life of emptiness and boredom.  By day, she's a telephone operator and by night she fills her time with promiscuous sexual adventures.  In a gritty and brave depiction, this is a lurid world, to be sure--but all she has to ""connect"" with others.  Seeking more, seeking better--she enters into a decidedly spiritual world.  Relinquishing her past, she embarks on a monogamous relationship with David Duchovney and attempts to fill the void in her life by spreading the word.  She becomes a woman transformed by the church.  When an unexpected tragedy strikes, she now has faith to console her.  Her support group, led by a prophet, believe in the Second Coming.  With supreme and unerring devotion, Rogers embraces a religious fervor and offers herself and her daughter up to God.  Her faith borders on a mania, but she never wavers.The challenging film never backs down from here on out.  God, of course, does not respond as she might have envisioned which results in yet another tragedy.  Rogers has gone from an empty vessel to a devout churchgoer to a state of dementia--and now faces her biggest challenge yet.  The END OF THE WORLD is here.  With horsemen, trumpets and other attendant signs of the Apocalypse--Rogers faces the ultimate decision.  Will she embrace the God again who she feels has betrayed her commitment?  In an ending unlike any other feature film I've ever seen, Rogers stays true to her character.  This film lets no one off the hook--it's daring, audacious, and so ambitious.Rogers has never been better.  I've always felt this was her ""Sophie's Choice.""  While perhaps not an actress with the greatest range, she really taps into something primal here.  It's as brave and open as you're likely to see an actress--emotionally and physically.  It should have been her Oscar nomination.  But the secondary star is ""The Rapture""'s screenplay.  Powerful and thought-provoking, this is a rare and ultra-serious work for adults.I don't pretend that everyone will love this movie.  It definitely pushes buttons and provokes debate.  But anyone who out-of-hand dismisses it, they are being unjust.  I want films to challenge, move, and engage me.  Far from bashing Christianity, ""The Rapture"" is a major work studying faith in the modern world.  It may not always be a pretty picture, but it is a relevant one.  An unqualified success, to me, at every level--I'm proud ""The Rapture"" was able to be made in an era when the least bit of controversy threatens to scuttle adult, intelligent filmmaking.

This movie I did not like because it was about sin, that they brought to the screen sleeping around and having orgies, sharing each others spouses or girlfriend/boyfriend with others.  They showed the actual sex and nudeness on the screen.  I had no idea that this was going to be in the movie.  I thought it was going to be about the coming of Christ, the rapture.When I bought the movie, it didn't state what it was rated.  It should have been rated X because of the sex in action and nudeness on the screen.  Very disappointed in this movie.  I didn't think of returning it back to get my money.

27556,A27E8WBZPYJX87,078060718X,"L. S. Slaughter ""silvanus""","[10, 13]","Sharon suffers great confusion about her role and nature in her body/space/time matrix.  After she immerses herself into body and sensate consciousness about as much as a human can, she finds despair.  A message is creeping into her through dreams, and she attaches its meaning to the prophecies of a cult of sincere fundamentalists who are possessed by the idea of the Rapture.  Passionate and obsessive about one thing or another as always, Sharon becomes as immersed in her interpretation of Revelation as she was about thrill-seeking.  In her bottom-line desire to &quot;lose herself&quot; in one thing or another, she finds that she cannot lose her Self at all.  At the end, she can neither accept the idea of a total, forgiving Authority any more than she can accept responsibility and forgiveness for her own misinterpretations of reality.  She is left at the edge of the River Styx, unable to cross.  She will not surrender her grievances, because they have become - and may have always been - the basis of her Self-Concept.  She would rather cling to her judgments and grievances that be delivered.Tolkin is an astonishing filmmaker, and THE RAPTURE has not lost any of its eerie power since I saw it in a Century City theater in 1991.  What amazes me is some Christians' inability to grasp its depth or sincerity, but it is a theological rubix cube, and those who like Kirkengaard and more mystical investigations into Christianity will relish it, as it cautions against 'literalism' as much as it eviscerates 'pride'.Is it outrageous that Mimi Rogers was not awarded some honor for her portrayal of the troubled &quot;Can't find my limits&quot; Sharon.  Nevermind she has probably ruffled some Hollywood feathers with her personal life, but everytime I watch this film I am left speechless by her immersion into this tragic character, whose angst will move anyone that has searched the Long Night for under-standing.Add to her bravura acting a well-cast David Duchovny, the wonderfully sybaritic Patric Buchau (spelling?), and a fine score by Thomas Newman, along with some great use of pop songs (Nico's &quot;I'll Be Your Mirror&quot; creeps through the wall like an Angel just as Sharon is about to kill herself in a dingy motel room!), and one has a knockout film.Nevermind the special effects are on the low-end, what does that matter, really? This is a film about content, soul's content, so Tolkin can be forgiven his restrictions for bells and whistles.  In fact, the FX are rather in keeping with Sharon's consciousness, anyway, and to have them blown up would have derailed the film's focus.Also recommended: Tolkin's underrated comedy, &quot;THE NEW AGE&quot;.",5,Incredible.

27557,A1GF7BR6K22GZD,078060718X,Mark Norvell,"[28, 32]","Sharon (Mimi Rogers) is a phone operator who leads a hedonistic lifestyle of swinging sex. But she's empty and tired inside. She discovers a religious sect who follow the prophecies of a child (""...and a child shall lead them..."") about the rapture, the second coming of Christ and judgement day. She is hesitant at first, but after a near suicide, she crosses over and becomes ""saved"". She marries an old boyfriend from her past (David Duchovney) and has a little girl. When tragedy strikes and she's troubled by an apparent vision, she steadfastly believes the rapture is here and takes to the desert with her child to await God. There, her faith will be put to the ultimate test. While some may find this film arty, far-fetched or even pretentious, I found it excellent and quite unlike anything I've ever seen. Rogers is marvelous as Sharon and believable as a modern woman who has questions about faith and God. Duchovney is also good as Randy who sticks by Sharon because he loves her. The film has shocking moments to be sure but it has a dream like quality which gives the subject matter an eerie edge. There are times when it even approaches spellbinding. For those who enjoy challenging films that leave you talking about it later, this is one to watch. Even if you don't like it, you'll think about it. ""The Rapture"" is not a religious film nor is it preachy. It takes no stand on anything really but it does leave you wondering about faith and what heaven is. The DVD has interviews with Rogers and others involved in the film.

27559,A1WX42M589VAMQ,078060718X,Mir,"[173, 196]","I've read some of the reviews already posted (from Christians who are touchy about the subject through to those who clearly are Anti-Christian and delight in poking fun at believers). The diverse opinions suffice to tell you this is not as simplistic or poorly done a film as some might suggest. I do not understand the reviews that say they are confused and don't understand. The movie is hardly that complicated that you can't get some coherent understanding of the plot.NOTE: I may review more detail than you wish. Consider this a spoiler warning, although I don't give it all away, I wouldn't want you to feel cheated.First off: I'm a believer. Yes, I believe in God, Christ, the Bible, the historic creeds and in the Rapture to come (I'm post-trib, for those who care). With all that, I liked this film. I enjoyed Mimi Rogers' performance and I enjoyed seeing the journey of this troubled character. We're not dealing with a character who does things in moderation. When she was pre-Christian, she didn't just have sex, she had SEX!, promiscuously, in groups, etc. We learn it's her way of filling this void she feels, the boredom of her meaningless existence. She attempts suicide. She's a mess. BUT...she has a vision of ""the pearl"" and it gives her a sense of peace and soon she's turned her life over to God and she's a Christian with a Z for ZEAL, evangelizing anyone she can--on the job, on the phone, friends, strangers. To some believers, this seems quite fine and laudable. To some, it will seem strange and immoderate. I think that's part of the interest. Where is this woman going now?The movie has this haunting air about it. You get a sense of being on the edge of doom, which is suitable given the subject matter. Even when she's all aglow and talking about God, you get the sense this character is rushing headlong into another type of excess. The character may have found something that gives her purpose, and a stability, but something about her is still unbalanced emotionally. Even her ""peace"" is an excessive peace. Tragedy befalls her--SPOILERS--stop reading if you don't wanna know:--when her husband is murdered in a killing spree at work, and still she keeps this strange calm. You don't see her really break down or do anything a normal grieving woman--Christian or otherwise--would do. It's rather spooky.When she has visions that beckon her to the desert, visions that gave me the willies and seemed kind of sinister, like a haunting--visions that have even her church's Prophetic Boy warning her that they stand unconfirmed by other believers and might be from Satan--we have a growing suspicion that something will go terribly wrong.And it does.One can look at this story as the descent into madness of a never very stable woman and wonder if anything in those last minutes is real or if it's all imagined, sanity banished.From a Christian perspective, I take enjoyment in a more literal reading that, despite any directorial intention is the most taken away from the film. This is a woman we've seen crack up, a woman whose been kept in check by her faith, her husband and her church. When she loses her ties to a husband, who never had that weird, glazed look like the main character,  and when she then distances herself from the accountability and safety net of a church by heading for the wilderness, and then when she allows her faith to buckle, she's left with nothing to stop her from rashness and crazed decisions.What should this woman know? She should know from her church sermons that to go into the desert is typically a sign of temptation to come: Jesus went into the desert and the devil tried to get him to move away from his mission and disobey God.  Here, we see a woman who is tempted, perhaps not by Satan, but by her own desires. She wants to be raptured. She wants to go to heaven. She wants to be done with life down here. She wants the culmination of her faith. She's tried to die before and failed, she wants to go to the better place. The temptation is great, so great, she forgets simple admonitions she surely knows by heart--Thou shalt not kill, thou shalt love the Lord thy God, thou shalt not put the Lord thy God to the test.A simple prophetic warning that is uttered by the Prophet Boy and subsequently by the character's daughter, one that is ambiguous at best--""Don't expect God to meet you halfway""--is twisted, as any advice can be, to suit one's emotional needs or fears.To Christians, some things will irk. For instance, the innacurate rendering of a well-known Biblical doctrine/verse: We love Him because He first loved us. Well, here it becomes, ""He loves us because we love him.""  A total turnaround of truth.The Controversial Ending:  To any orthodox (not as in Greek Orthodox but as in traditionally doctrinal) Christian, the ending is not controversial. Are we suprised that God both showers grace and forgives at the last minute or that he implacably judges and condemns? I think not. We know He does both.However, God shows his grace by giving the character multiple opportunities to make a different decision. Providentially, someone she knows from her past shows up near the end. Then another character counsels her. Then another gives her an example. So many chances....Then character chooses her final fate, all the while unwilling to see where she is at fault. It's easier to just blame God.The director/writer may have meant this to be Anti-Christian. Dunno. I didn't HAVE to take that away from it. I could choose to see it as an examination of a particular character with specific weaknesses and how it manifests in the context of Christian eschatology. The other Christians aren't shown being cruel or harsh or encouraging disastrous outcomes. Ultimately, this is about this ONE woman. One woman's choice. A very pro-choice film, actually. And the ending may cheer fans of INVICTUS, but it will make most of us feel pity.If one wants to see it as a mental degeneration of a troubled woman, that works, too. But I don't think it works as well as accepting the ending as ""real"".  The film's power works only if the woman's choice is a true-life scenario and not the mental figment of a lunatic.The Rapture can lead to fruitful and interesting discussion after viewing, even for believers. I recommend it.",4,A movie that will definitely provoke thought/discussion!,1121126400,"07 12, 2005",2005,6294,"[""'ve"", 'read', 'reviews', 'already', 'posted', 'Christians', 'who', 'are', 'touchy',

JEFFREY MCMAHON ""herculodge""","[4, 6]","The Rapture is a brave film about a hedonistic woman who, bored and empty from her swinging, tries to fill the void with an ecstatic brand of Christianity in which dreams, revelations, and portents are the main focus of her new faith. She is so vulnerable and naive that she embraces the most dangerous elements of religious conversion--emotionalism, fanaticism, end-of-the-world fatalism. Mimi Rogers' performance is excellent as a woman slowly having a religious meltdown but the final act goes on too long and becomes to maudlin for my tastes. Nevertheless, this is a brave film filled with excellent dialogue that questions faith from many angles. Is the film anti-religious? I don't think so. Atheism and hedonism are not kindly looked at in this film. Nor is blind faith. But just because Tolken shows the dangers of a fanatic, doesn't mean he is hostile to all forms of religion. Those charges are unfair. The film is far more complex than being a screed against this or that brand of faith.",4,Dark Almost Gothic Portrait of a Tormented Woman,1117324800,"05 29, 2005",2005,998,"['Rapture', 'brave', 'film', 'hedonistic', 'woman', 'who', 'bored', 'empty', 'swinging', 'tries', 'fill', 'void', 'ecstatic', 'brand', 'Christianity', 'dreams', 'revelations', 'portents', 'are', 'main', 'focus', 'new', 'faith', 'so', 'vulnerable', 'naive', 'most', 'dangerous', 'elements', 'religious', 'conversion', 'emotionalism', 'fanaticism', 'end-of-the-world', 'fatalism', 'Mimi', 'Rogers', 'performance', 'excellent', 'woman', 'slowly', 'having', 'religious', 'meltdown', 'final', 'act', 'too', 'long', 'maudlin', 'tastes', 'Nevertheless', 'brave', 'film', 'filled', 'excellent', 'dialogue', 'questions', 'faith', 'many', 'angles', 'film', 'anti-religious', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'Atheism', 'hedonism', 'are', 'not', 'kindly', 'looked', 'film', 'blind', 'faith', 'just', 'Tolken', 'dangers', 'fanatic', ""n't"", 'mean', 'hostile', 'forms', 'religion', 'charges', 'are', 'unfair', 'film', 'far', 'more', 'complex', 'being', 'screed', 'brand', 'faith']",Rapture VHS

This movie was saying everything I had wanted to say about religious Millenialism, and saying it (I thought) loud and clear.Sharon, the character played by Mimi Rogers, was not living a life she was happy with, so, like so many others, instead of looking within herself to see what she could do to fix it, she (however unconsciously) sought without.  Naturally there are always people willing to provide a sense of safety, surety, and surface happiness, or to show you how to achieve those things.  All you have to do is give up what you are, and put all your faith in something that demands everything (and everything most certainly is demanded) of you, not only your life, but your soul.Michael Tolkin is laughing at Born Again-ism, Millenialists, and fundies of the Christian persuasion in this movie. The Rapture is a primer on getting just what you pray for - here is what will happen if this is what you truly believe.  Fortunately, he is also able to show us a woman who is strong enough to resist, at the end, although it means spending her eternity caught between Heaven and Hell.When looking for meaning or layers, or subtext, or whatever, in a movie (or any other work of art, for that matter), it always helps to put the thing in context with other works by the same person.

27566,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,078060718X,RMurray847,"[9, 11]","THE RAPTURE explores a subject that few films dare explore with any effort at seriousness:  religion.  In movies, religion is usually made fun of or satirized.  Rarely is it shown as a force that can actually make people's lives better.  (Exceptions include Robert Duvall's remarkable THE APOSTLE).In THE RAPTURE, we have Mimi Rogers (in a performance that should have gotten her some awards) as a telephone operator (""What city, please?) by day and a party-girl swinger by night.  She leads a VERY hedonistic lifestyle...one that clearly leaves her empty and full of self-loathing...as it would any thinking person.  During one of her trysts, she meets David Duchovny, and the two develop a closeness (despite Duchovny's horrible mullet!).  Meanwhile, Rogers begins to overhear conversations at the workplace about The Rapture and other portents of the end of the world.She is drawn to these people, because they seem to have a peace and a certainty that's missing from her life.  Eventually, she is born again and even manages to bring Duchovny along with her.Years later, her faith is put to the test, and she undergoes some severe personal loss.  When the rapture does arrive (this is when God is supposed to call all the Christians to heaven just prior to the start of the end times), Rogers has some mixed feelings.  I know this paragraph doesn't tell much, but if I go into details, I easily spoil the second half of the film...and it's full of interesting ethical, moral and religious dilemnas.Here's what I like.  Rogers is great.  She's almost worth the price of admission on her own.  She's never done anything since to approach this.  Will Patton, in a small but important role, is charismatic.  And as an X-Files fan, Duchovny is an added bonus.Furthermore, as I said, the film explores...without laughing...the idea that believing in God and turning your life over to Jesus is a viable choice.  That Christians do find peace in their choice and that God does perhaps answer prayers.  Whether one is a Christian or not...one must also recognize that a lot of people are and that it is a lifestyle that the movies all but ignore.However, that being said, the movie does depict all its Christians as being obsessed with prophecy about the end times, the coming apocalypse and the rapture.  Yes, many Christians are concerned with this.  But the vast majority of ""mainstream"" Christianity hesitates to try to interpret the Book of Revelations and discussions of what the end of the world will be like are avoided.  Revelations is too strange.  The movie would have you believe that this is pretty much the only book in the Bible that Christians read.  I would have liked more balance...fewer extremes.  Just as Rogers character at the beginning is extreme in her hedonism...so is she extreme in her beliefs.But at least they aren't mocked, and I liked that.  There has never really been a movie quite like THE RAPTURE before.  It takes on big subjects and isn't afraid to provoke thought or debate.  It has moments of pretty raw emotion.  While obviously made on a VERY low budget...that helps the film seem more real, the people more mundane and down to earth.The film is a hard R, and should not be viewed by kids...who would be exposed to sexual images they don't need early on and who would be bored to tears by the more intellectual parts later on.  But for adults who are looking for something different, and who don't mind having some hard-core beliefs explored...then I highly recommend this flawed but riveting work.",4,Fascinating and brave,1157500800,"09 6, 2006",2006,3535,"['RAPTURE', 'subject', 'few', 'films', 'dare', 'explore', 'effort', 'seriousness', 'religion', 'movies', 'religion', 'usually', 'made', 'fun', 'satirized', 'Rarely', 'shown', 'force', 'can', 'actually', 'make', 'people', 'lives', 'better', 'Exceptions', 'include', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'remarkable', 'THE', 'APOSTLE', '.In', 'RAPTURE', 'have', 'Mimi', 'Rogers', 'performance', 'should', 'have', 'gotten', 'awards', 'telephone', 'operator', 'What', 'city', 'please', 'day', 'party-girl', 'swinger', 'night', 'VERY', 'hedonistic', 'lifestyle', 'one', 'clearly', 'empty', 'full', 'self-loathing', 'would', 'thinking', 'person', 'one', 'trysts', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'two', 'develop', 'closeness', 'Duchovny', 'horrible', 'mullet', 'Meanwhile', 'Rogers', 'overhear', 'conversations', 'workplace', 'Rapture', 'other', 'portents', 'end', 'world.She', 'drawn', 'people', 'seem', 'have', 'peace', 'certainty', 'missing', 'life', 'Eventually', 'born', 'again', 'even', 'manages', 'bring', 'Duchovny', 'her.Years', 'later', 'faith', 'put', 'test', 'severe', 'personal', 'loss', 'When', 'rapture', 'arrive', 'when', 'God', 'supposed', 'call', 'Christians', 'heaven', 'just', 'prior', 'start', 'end', 'times', 'Rogers', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'know', 'paragraph', ""n't"", 'tell', 'much', 'go', 'details', 'easily', 'spoil', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'full', 'interesting', 'ethical', 'moral', 'religious', 'dilemnas.Here', 'what', 'like', 'Rogers', 'great', 'almost', 'worth', 'price', 'admission', 'own', 'never', 'done', 'anything', 'approach', 'Will', 'Patton', 'small', 'important', 'role', 'charismatic', 'X-Files', 'fan', 'Duchovny', 'added', 'bonus.Furthermore', 'said', 'film', 'explores', 'laughing', 'idea', 'believing', 'God', 'turning', 'life', 'Jesus', 'viable', 'choice', 'Christians', 'do', 'find', 'peace', 'choice', 'God', 'perhaps', 'answer', 'prayers', 'Whether', 'one', 'Christian', 'not', 'one', 'must', 'also', 'recognize', 'lot', 'people', 'are', 'lifestyle', 'movies', 'ignore.However', 'being', 'said', 'movie', 'depict', 'Christians', 'being', 'obsessed', 'prophecy', 'end', 'times', 'coming', 'apocalypse', 'rapture', 'Yes', 'many', 'Christians', 'are', 'concerned', 'vast', 'majority', 'mainstream', 'Christianity', 'try', 'interpret', 'Book', 'Revelations', 'discussions', 'what', 'end', 'world', 'will', 'be', 'are', 'avoided', 'Revelations', 'too', 'strange', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'pretty', 'much', 'only', 'book', 'Bible', 'read', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'more', 'balance', 'fewer', 'extremes', 'Just', 'Rogers', 'character', 'beginning', 'extreme', 'hedonism', 'so', 'extreme', 'beliefs.But', 'least', 'are', ""n't"", 'mocked', 'liked', 'never', 'really', 'been', 'movie', 'quite', 'THE', 'RAPTURE', 'big', 'subjects', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'provoke', 'thought', 'debate', 'moments', 'pretty', 'raw', 'emotion', 'obviously', 'made', 'VERY', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'seem', 'more', 'real', 'people', 'more', 'mundane', 'down', 'earth.The', 'film', 'hard', 'R', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'viewed', 'kids', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'exposed', 'sexual', 'images', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'early', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'bored', 'tears', 'more', 'intellectual', 'parts', 'later', 'adults', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'different', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'having', 'hard-core', 'beliefs', 'explored', 'then', 'highly', 'recommend', 'flawed', 'riveting', 'work']",Rapture VHS

27572,A2D63RN5LF14R2,078060718X,"THE BLUEMAHLER ""THE BLUEMAHLER""","[4, 6]","Once upon a time there was a breed known as independent filmmakers. Usually with shoestring budgets, the indies, taking no prisoners, discarded business plans, forgot to look at marketing strategies, and the image of a proposed target audience was as abstract and surreal to them as their films often were to audiences. The indies were decidedly reactionary to the Hollywood institution. Maya Deren once said ""I make films for what Hollywood spends on lipstick."" It was the indies who were progressively harking back to the dawn of cinema, before the rules of filmmaking had been established and canonized.Stanley Kubrick was the closest Hollywood would get to the indie spirit, but Kubrick, for all his aesthetic brilliance, was, essentially, an academic. Whatever Kubrick's genre, be it sci-fi, porn, horror, war, swashbuckler, his approach stemmed from a safe classroom distance. Kubrick lacked the fevered intensity and aesthetic struggle of the indies, and subjects such as horror and sex were rendered as studies and, therefore, matters on somewhat safe critical ground for the mainstream.Newly minted and authorized film critics, such as Roger Ebert, would lavish heaps of praise on Dr. Kubrick, but Ebert was clearly out of his ivory towered ball park when trying to grasp the likes of Larry Cohen`s God Told Me To or Michael Cimino's Heaven's Gate, which is unfortunate considering Ebert once scripted for Hollywood outsider Russ Meyer.The 1990s was the last real decade of the independents. Even by then, they were becoming an extinct breed, and in their place were the new breed of timid indie-lites, who merely emulate the Hollywood recipe without having the budget for the high priced, bland ingredients.In 1991 Michael Tolkin's The Rapture did what an independent film is supposed to do: took critics by surprise. Some critics even managed praise. Tolkin followed this success with The New Age in 1994 and then, unfortunately, disappeared from the radar. The Rapture came on the heels of the previous year's Begotten (1990, E. Elias Merhige), and both are films with spiritually organic testicles.Sharon (Mimi Rogers, in a mesmerizing role) works as a telephone operator by day.  It is a mind-numbingly monotonous job.  By night, she likes to have sex and she has it passionately.  Sharon plays the swinging game, seeking out new adventures and new partners.  Swinging, however, is becoming as robotic as her day job, because, despite her passion, Sharon is seeking something more.  She is seeking a personally relentless communication which at first she thought she might find through the amorous escapades of the night.One day at work, Sharon overhears Christian co-workers talking about a dream of a pearl.  The pearl is something akin to an allegorical hymn for the world's end.  To Sharon, it appears that those who dream of the pearl find God and the meaning of life.  Sharon tries to pass herself off as a Christian, but it's a bit like someone pretending to be drunk, and her co-workers see through it.A couple that Sharon swings with cease a night of sex long enough to speak of the Pearl, which one of them has tattooed on her back.  Christian proselytizers show up at Sharon's door, trying to convert her, and they too speak of the Pearl.  Through the vision of the Pearl, Sharon believes God is calling out to her.  Sharon is in anguish.  One lover abandons her.  Randy (David Duchovny), another lover, argues with her.  Randy is an atheist, who once murdered for money; he sees no meaning at all in life, and compares Sharon's God-seeking to a heroin addict looking for a fix.Sharon finally has the religious experience for which she has been yearning.  Like an overzealous, sanctimonious twelve year old girl at Vacation Bible School, the newly reborn Sharon begins proselytizing to callers at work.  Sharon's boss, himself a Christian, tells Sharon there is a time and place for everything, but not at work.  Sharon knows now that her life must be clean for God.The power of great sex prevails and Randy, seeing the light of God, marries Sharon.  They have a child and join a fundamentalist group, bonding with those who want to understand God and his plans.  All too briefly, Randy becomes Sharon's sole personal connection and provides the life she seeks.  Tragedy prevails, however, and bathos rears its ugly head as Sharon is put through several tests.  Her life is thrown into a frenzied quagmire.  Believing she knows God's intention, Sharon commits a heinous crime when she feels God has failed to deliver his promise.  When all seems lost, the dreaded apocalypse literally comes true and Sharon faces a choice.  Will she profess her love for her heavenly Father or not?Sharon faces the same dilemma that Job faced, but for Sharon, God is no different than those countless lovers from one night stands so many years before.  God screwed her, but he would not give her the personal communication that she needed.  God used her and took away everything she loved.  When Sharon called out for an answer, God turned his back to her and merely said, ""You must still love me.""The Rapture is about free will, and that includes free will to love or reject the idea of the divine.  Sharon remains fiercely independent in the tradition of Bizet's Carmen.  She is not afraid of the consequences, even in the threat of a purgatorial eternity.  Sharon's life and choices are startling.  She is a stupid, proud, passionate woman who has the audacity to tell God, ""I knocked and the door was not opened.  I am a stupid woman, but it's your fault I'm stupid because I asked for wisdom and you denied me.  I will take the purity of my heart over your cold mind and I will not worship the likes of so selfish a lover.""Of course, Sharon is as selfish as she believes God to be, but she no longer expects to be loved. The Rapture harshly embraces a defiantly feminine spirituality which rejects the barren, patriarchal idea of God.Like the late Mary Daly, Sharon goes ""Beyond God the Father,"" and that is simultaneously liberating for her and her downfall, because she approaches her liberating moment with the black and white extremes which have characterized her entire life.In the Gospel of John, the apostles are instructed to ""Go and spread the Good News.""  News is always new and The Rapture takes a new and refreshing approach to a subject which, more often than not, is hopelessly pious, stagnant and, ultimately, saccharine.  This is one of the most challenging, humanistic and Christian films of the last twenty years.*MY REVIEW ORIGINALLY APPEARED AT 366 WEIRD MOVIES",5,"CHALLENGING, HUMANISTIC & CHRISTIAN (WHEN INDIE FILM

27577,A3T46X7M3AUDAB,078060718X,William Timothy Lukeman,"[5, 6]","As previous comments show, this unique film evokes intense responses from its viewers, both positive & negative. And with the increasing presence of fundamentalism on the national & world stage, the questions it poses become ever more pressing & pertinent. Interestingly, both believers & non-believers fall on both the positive & negative sides here!The basic story is common enough today: Sharon (a superb, risk-taking Mimi Rogers) works at an unfulfilling job & leads an unfulfilling personal life of empty group sex. She's desperate for meaning, purpose, structure -- drifting through a desolate modern landscape that offers neither sanctuary or salavation to the lost & achingly lonely soul.And then she begins to dream of The Pearl, as some of her born-again co-workers discuss some mysterious boy prophet among themselves ... and she finds her purpose & meaning in a devout, unquestioning acceptance of the fundamentalist Jesus. The End Times are coming soon, and the faithful must prepare for it. She does so by marrying & converting erstwhile sex partner David Duchovny, and having a lovely little girl with him. It's the life she'd been seeking all those years.And then random -- or is it? -- tragedy strikes, leaving her a widow. She seemingly copes with this tremendous loss through her faith, yet questions are nagging at her unconscious. She decides that God is calling her & her daughter to the desert, as a trial & purification of sorts, to await the Rapture.I won't give away any more of the story, except to say that writer-director Michael Tolkin follows the idea of fundamentalism to a logical, chilling conclusion. And he poses some wrenching questions -- while the idea of a Godless, meaningless Universe is terrifying & unbearable for many, he suggests that a universe of fundamentalist meaning where God does exist may be even more terrifying, if you insist on personal autonomy & satisfactory answers over submission to an infinite but strangely narrow love. Or can it truly be called love, on the terms offered?The final choice in this film has led to a good deal of discussion. Not wanting to spoil it, I'll only say that Sharon seems to make that choice out of anger & defiance, not pride & guilt. Her choice reminds me very much of the conclusion to Camus' classic essay, ""The Myth of Sisyphus."" It's definitely an existential choice, and I think an honorable one. But you'll make your own decision on that.Yes, the production values aren't big budget. That's actually an advantage, as spectacular CGI would only get in the way of the story & its ideas. It's worth the loss of special effects dollars to maintain the integrity of Tolkin's vision, like it or loathe it. I guarantee that you won't be unmoved as the final credits roll.
