One is a joke where Al Goldstein tells us what we can do after death. I will admit the best part interviews Bambi Woods from Debbie Does Dallas. If you can find anyplace else where she was ever interviewed in person, than you are the rare one who wouldn't find this worth the price of the whole DVD. Forwardable is the Vera Knotty interview where she peforms the stunt that gave her that name.. yuck!",4,Saturday Night Live of smut,1306713600,"05 30, 2011",2011,522,"['commercials', 'swinger', 'clubs', 'phone', 'numbers', 'blanked', 'out', 'course', 'are', ""n't"", 'open', 'anymore', 'are', 'sometimes', 'funny', 'One', 'joke', 'where', 'Al', 'Goldstein', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'death', 'will', 'admit', 'best', 'part', 'interviews', 'Bambi', 'Woods', 'Debbie', 'Does', 'Dallas', 'can', 'find', 'anyplace', 'else', 'where', 'was', 'ever', 'interviewed', 'person', 'are', 'rare', 'one', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'find', 'worth', 'price', 'whole', 'DVD', 'Forwardable', 'Vera', 'Knotty', 'interview', 'where', 'stunt', 'gave', 'name..', 'yuck']",Midnight Blue Collection Volume 2: Porn Stars of the 70's

No matter what you think about Al, he allowed porn stars to be themselves on the air. This show has clips from a variety of his episodes. The highlight of this collection is the interviews with Marilyn Chambers. I always get a kick out of the former Ivory Snow gal.  Annie Sprinkle is also a delight.But what I find myself more glued to is the ads for various swing clubs and porn theaters plus an escort service. I wouldn't mind sitting through these ads during breaks in Seinfeld. Why doesn't Plato's Retreat advertise during the Superbowl? And who knew strip clubs back then had buffets?This is essential viewing for anyone who enjoys vintage adult entertainment.",5,I can't get enough of the ads,1137801600,"01 21, 2006",2006,720,"['Al', 'Goldstein', 'created', 'great', 'show', 'Midnight', 'Blue', 'matter', 'what', 'think', 'Al', 'allowed', 'porn', 'stars', 'be', 'air', 'show', 'clips', 'variety', 'episodes', 'highlight', 'collection', 'interviews', 'Marilyn', 'Chambers', 'always', 'get', 'kick', 'former', 'Ivory', 'Snow', 'gal', 'Annie', 'Sprinkle', 'also', 'delight.But', 'what', 'find', 'more', 'glued', 'ads', 'various', 'swing', 'clubs', 'porn', 'theaters', 'escort', 'service', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'sitting', 'ads', 'breaks', 'Seinfeld', 'Why', ""n't"", 'Plato', 'Retreat', 'advertise', 'Superbowl', 'who', 'knew', 'strip', 'clubs', 'back', 'then', 'had', 'buffets', 'essential', 'viewing', 'anyone', 'who', 'vintage', 'adult', 'entertainment']",Midnight Blue Collection Volume 2: Porn Stars of the 70's
