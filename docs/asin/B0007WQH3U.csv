892896,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B0007WQH3U,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[15, 16]","Calorie Blasting Party is a fun, 42-minute dance workout which is made up of the following segments:  a 4-minute warm up, four choreographed dance sequences (each consisting of about 4-5 individual dance patterns), and a 3-minute cool down.  Instructor Julianne ""Julz"" Arney teaches the dances using a unique, 3-tempo format.  First, she will introduce the steps at the slowest tempo, Tempo 1.  Then, once you have the basic idea, she will speed it up a little to Tempo 2, giving you some additional time to practice.  Finally, you'll perform the dance at full tempo, Tempo 3.As mentioned above, the dance sequences (about 8 minutes each) consist of 4-5 individual dance patterns which Julz teaches one-by-one.  I have trouble with complex choreography, but I generally found the steps here to be simple, easy-to-learn, and fun as well; there were a few times during the workout that I struggled to follow along, but that didn't seem to matter much as long as I was moving.  I do think that doing the steps at the slowest tempo sometimes made them actually HARDER to replicate; I would have preferred moving more quickly to Tempo 2.  Furthermore, it would have been great to have a Tempo 3 only option on the DVD for once you are already familiar with the workout.The DVD is well-chaptered, which is nice because you can easily do only a couple of the dances if you're looking for a shorter workout.  In addition, a 5-minute bonus ""Dance Off"" combines some of the moves previously learned, in an all Tempo 3 segment--I liked this but would've liked it even better if it was longer.  The first time I tried this workout, I had trouble keeping my heart rate in my target zone, but the second time (which was following a strength workout), my HR definitely stayed elevated; I expect that it will be even easier to keep my HR up once I become more familiar with the moves.Overall, I am happy with this workout and believe that I will get a lot of use out of it.",4,Fun dance workout which can easily be broken into shorter segments,1144713600,"04 11, 2006",2006,1957,"['Calorie', 'Blasting', 'Party', 'fun', '42-minute', 'dance', 'workout', 'made', 'following', 'segments', '4-minute', 'warm', 'up', 'four', 'choreographed', 'dance', 'sequences', 'consisting', '4-5', 'individual', 'dance', 'patterns', '3-minute', 'cool', 'down', 'Instructor', 'Julianne', 'Julz', 'Arney', 'dances', 'using', 'unique', '3-tempo', 'format', 'First', 'will', 'introduce', 'steps', 'slowest', 'tempo', 'Tempo', '1', 'Then', 'once', 'have', 'basic', 'idea', 'will', 'speed', 'up', 'little', 'Tempo', '2', 'giving', 'additional', 'time', 'practice', 'Finally', ""'ll"", 'perform', 'dance', 'full', 'tempo', 'Tempo', '3.As', 'mentioned', 'dance', 'sequences', '8', 'minutes', 'consist', '4-5', 'individual', 'dance', 'patterns', 'Julz', 'one-by-one', 'have', 'trouble', 'complex', 'choreography', 'generally', 'found', 'steps', 'here', 'be', 'simple', 'easy-to-learn', 'fun', 'as', 'well', 'were', 'few', 'times', 'workout', 'struggled', 'follow', 'along', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'matter', 'much', 'as', 'long', 'was', 'moving', 'do', 'think', 'doing', 'steps', 'slowest', 'tempo', 'sometimes', 'made', 'actually', 'HARDER', 'replicate', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'moving', 'more', 'quickly', 'Tempo', '2', 'Furthermore', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'have', 'Tempo', '3', 'only', 'option', 'DVD', 'once', 'are', 'already', 'familiar', 'workout.The', 'DVD', 'well-chaptered', 'nice', 'can', 'easily', 'do', 'only', 'couple', 'dances', ""'re"", 'looking', 'shorter', 'workout', 'addition', '5-minute', 'bonus', 'Dance', 'Off', 'moves', 'previously', 'learned', 'Tempo', '3', 'segment', 'liked', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'even', 'better', 'was', 'longer', 'first', 'time', 'tried', 'workout', 'had', 'trouble', 'keeping', 'heart', 'rate', 'target', 'zone', 'second', 'time', 'was', 'following', 'strength', 'workout', 'HR', 'definitely', 'stayed', 'elevated', 'expect', 'will', 'be', 'even', 'easier', 'keep', 'HR', 'up', 'once', 'become', 'more', 'familiar', 'moves.Overall', 'am', 'happy', 'workout', 'believe', 'will', 'get', 'lot', 'use']",Dance Off the Inches - Calorie Blasting Party!

There is a ""bonus"" 5 minute dance off, which has some of the moves from the full routine...I like to add it in right before the cooldown for a total workout time of 48 minutes.Julie Arney instructs...good cueing, but ""Julz"" is overty perky in this one.  Almost to the point where I wished that there was a music only option (and the music is Not good).  Julie is usually perky (I love her in Quick Fix Hip Hop), but in this workout she was way over the top!I enjoyed the dance segments and thought that the tempo changes were fine and helpful to me in order to learn the dance steps.  I was able to get the whole thing down on the 1st try, except for the last segment which got a little complex near the end.  Almost all of the moves can be done on a carpeted surface, and the 2 or so dance steps that weren't carpet-friendly (the party hop move springs to mind) were easy enough to modify.The cooldown had No stretching for the legs, which is a big no-no in my book.  I had to add some stretching on my own.I'd recommend getting DOTI Tummy Tone or Sizzling Salsa over this one, but it's not bad.

In this workout, it's got a mix of dancy type moves that are easy to follow because Juliane (the instructor) teaches them in a cool format - each pattern is taught to you at three tempos.  It's done first slow, a bit quicker and then at full tempo because by then you'll know the moves.  Then there is a new pattern to learn at the same way and just before you start to get bored she changes the moves to keep it fresh and interesting.  There are the usuall cha-chas and mambo style moves but its still a fresh take on other workouts.

I like the instructor and the fellow exercisers are great.  And, yes, the dances are first taught at a slower pace.  But, the instructor quickly moves it up to tempo 2 and then to tempo three.  The steps are NEVER taught slow enough for me to catch on.  I have to rewind and do tempo one about 10 times before being able to move on to tempo 2.  Tempo 3 is way to out of control for me at this point.  I don't have the steps down enough yet for tempo three.  The instructor just doesn't break down the steps enough.  I was so frustrated after 10 minutes that I turned it off and returned to my trusty Pilates tape.  I have done other dance tapes...it took me two times through to get Crunch's Fat Burning Dance Party (I found that to be an acceptable time frame...I took dance lessons in high school so this isn't new to me and I am am intermediate level exerciser who does lots of pilates and step) and the instructor is much better at breaking down the steps on that video.  The speed never seems too high.  I'll keep trying this tape but it is going to take me while to get these steps down.  It looks fun.

She is right that this won't keep your heart rate up for those in decent shape & work out at least semi-often. Level 1 is too slow as another said. The production is high & the menu is decent. No ability to change the usual looped bad 70s disco music though.Juliane Arney is a great teacher, she even cues YOUR right, not hers & the other 4 backup dancers. She breaks down the steps to just lower body first, it's simplified aerobics looking form, then adds to it until you got the lower body steps complete, then she adds the arms & then some extra style. This way of teaching is the best way for those with 2 left feet, but as another said, with this breakdown, you don't need to go pedestrian slow like here, but only 1/2 speed to keep up the heart rate & enthusiasm.The moves themselves I didn't like, Juliane is a good hip hop dancer, but here there are a lot of old style jazz Broadway moves which are passe.
