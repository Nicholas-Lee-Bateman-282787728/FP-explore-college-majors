All of a sudden this DVD came out, and it is rock solid. A band in fine form, a great selection of songs (although I would have loved a version of Ammonia Avenue), just a great DVD. Nothing fancy about this one. No big stage show, or great graphics, just a solid performance. Some great tracks: Time, Prime Time, Dr. Tarr and Professor Fether, I wouldn't wanna be like you... and a very interesting fact: all of the band takes a lead vocal (with the exception of the keyboard player), and they do renditions of classic vocal performances by great vocalists.If you like Alan Parsons Project at all, this is a must have!",5,Alan Parsons Project lives on,1277942400,"07 1, 2010",2010,731,"['actually', 'was', 'interested', 'finding', 'DVD', 'featuring', 'music', 'Alan', 'Parsons', 'could', 'never', 'find', 'anything', 'sudden', 'DVD', 'came', 'out', 'rock', 'solid', 'band', 'fine', 'form', 'great', 'selection', 'songs', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'version', 'Ammonia', 'Avenue', 'just', 'great', 'DVD', 'Nothing', 'fancy', 'one', 'big', 'stage', 'show', 'great', 'graphics', 'just', 'solid', 'performance', 'great', 'tracks', 'Time', 'Prime', 'Time', 'Dr.', 'Tarr', 'Professor', 'Fether', 'would', ""n't"", 'wan', 'na', 'be', 'very', 'interesting', 'fact', 'band', 'lead', 'vocal', 'exception', 'keyboard', 'player', 'do', 'renditions', 'classic', 'vocal', 'performances', 'great', 'vocalists.If', 'Alan', 'Parsons', 'Project', 'must', 'have']",N/A

His voice is the lead on songs like Eye in the Sky, Time and Don't Answer Me.  He recently passed away but in 2004 he was still very much alive.
