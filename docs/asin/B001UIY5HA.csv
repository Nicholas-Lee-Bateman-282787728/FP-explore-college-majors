1238892,AR3BZOTB7IY78,B001UIY5HA,Anton Karidian,"[2, 2]","As with most other reviewers here, I think that INVASION IOWA is fun to watch, and is often warm and touching too. The 2 DVDs contain 10 episodes, each 30 minutes long. I first watched this with a group of people, and we agreed that the show went where none of us had gone before on TV, with me the one exception since I had seenThe Joe Schmo Show - Season One Uncensoredthat was similar in setting up a fake film production. As you've probably read already, INVASION IOWA involves William Shatner and his cohorts from Hollywood ""invading"" the small town of Riverside, Iowa, supposedly to film a science fiction movie, yet the movie is actually fake and the whole purpose is to film a reality TV show ABOUT the townspeople thinking they are making a movie. It's interesting to see how the people of Riverside react to the situation, and most of them are very warm, welcoming, and excited to be the setting for a movie. Also, several people from the town are cast in the ""movie."" Shatner clearly drives the proceedings with his humor and his ability to bond with the townspeople.There's a good deal of comedy in this, but as William Shatner pointed out in the commentary (which he does with 2 producers on 2 episodes) and in his bookUp Till Now: The Autobiography, the original plan was to derive most of the humor from making the townspeople look foolish. But Shatner and others making the show decided that was too mean-spirited, so they decided instead to make THEMSELVES look foolish and thus make the show a spoof on Hollywood. The plan worked well, with one of the funniest running jokes being a guy repeatedly phoning in and impersonating Sean Connery, who supposedly was going to appear in the movie. This fake Connery was very difficult to please and foul-mouthed, but the townspeople were still excited at the thought of the great Sean Connery coming to Riverside. Another funny gag was Shatner's doofus body double who continually messed up the production. And since I mentioned THE JOE SCHMO SHOW earlier, I'll note that it and INVASION IOWA were made by the same production company. I think INVASION IOWA is the better of the two programs, partly because SCHMO was fooling only one guy, whereas IOWA is fooling a whole town, and also because SCHMO got into these drawn-out interpersonal conflicts that were not even real because everybody but Joe was a fake character, whereas IOWA keeps a lot more variety going.INVASION IOWA drags a bit around the middle as the humor wanes, so a couple of episodes get rather tedious. Sometimes INVASION IOWA gets bogged down in showing the process of making their ""movie."" And I think the segments with the actress Desi Lydic describing her children's book to the townspeople don't work very well. Why didn't they just have her strut around more in her eye-popping alien outfit? Yum Yum!! However, toward the end INVASION IOWA picks up steam again, culminating in an episode where Shatner spills the beans to the townspeople that all this is just a fake. The tenth and final episode is the fake movie they had been making.All in all, INVASION IOWA is a fun and interesting mini-series that I do recommend, not just to William Shatner fans, but to anyone who enjoys reality TV.",4,A FUN Invasion For a Change,1327276800,"01 23, 2012",2012,3225,"['most', 'other', 'reviewers', 'here', 'think', 'INVASION', 'IOWA', 'fun', 'watch', 'often', 'warm', 'touching', 'too', '2', 'DVDs', 'contain', '10', 'episodes', '30', 'minutes', 'long', 'first', 'watched', 'group', 'people', 'agreed', 'show', 'went', 'where', 'none', 'had', 'gone', 'before', 'TV', 'one', 'exception', 'had', 'seenThe', 'Joe', 'Schmo', 'Show', 'Season', 'One', 'Uncensoredthat', 'was', 'similar', 'setting', 'up', 'fake', 'film', 'production', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'read', 'already', 'INVASION', 'IOWA', 'William', 'Shatner', 'cohorts', 'Hollywood', 'invading', 'small', 'town', 'Riverside', 'Iowa', 'supposedly', 'film', 'science', 'fiction', 'movie', 'yet', 'movie', 'actually', 'fake', 'whole', 'purpose', 'film', 'reality', 'TV', 'show', 'townspeople', 'thinking', 'are', 'making', 'movie', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'people', 'Riverside', 'react', 'situation', 'most', 'are', 'very', 'warm', 'welcoming', 'excited', 'be', 'setting', 'movie', 'Also', 'several', 'people', 'town', 'are', 'cast', 'movie', 'Shatner', 'clearly', 'proceedings', 'humor', 'ability', 'bond', 'good', 'deal', 'comedy', 'William', 'Shatner', 'pointed', 'out', 'commentary', '2', 'producers', '2', 'episodes', 'bookUp', 'Till', 'Now', 'Autobiography', 'original', 'plan', 'was', 'derive', 'most', 'humor', 'making', 'townspeople', 'look', 'foolish', 'Shatner', 'others', 'making', 'show', 'decided', 'was', 'too', 'mean-spirited', 'decided', 'instead', 'make', 'THEMSELVES', 'look', 'foolish', 'thus', 'make', 'show', 'spoof', 'Hollywood', 'plan', 'worked', 'well', 'one', 'funniest', 'running', 'jokes', 'being', 'guy', 'repeatedly', 'phoning', 'impersonating', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'who', 'supposedly', 'was', 'going', 'appear', 'movie', 'fake', 'Connery', 'was', 'very', 'difficult', 'please', 'foul-mouthed', 'townspeople', 'were', 'still', 'excited', 'thought', 'great', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'coming', 'Riverside', 'funny', 'gag', 'was', 'Shatner', 'doofus', 'body', 'double', 'who', 'continually', 'messed', 'up', 'production', 'mentioned', 'THE', 'JOE', 'SCHMO', 'SHOW', 'earlier', ""'ll"", 'note', 'INVASION', 'IOWA', 'were', 'made', 'same', 'production', 'company', 'think', 'INVASION', 'IOWA', 'better', 'two', 'programs', 'partly', 'SCHMO', 'was', 'fooling', 'only', 'one', 'guy', 'whereas', 'IOWA', 'fooling', 'whole', 'town', 'also', 'SCHMO', 'got', 'drawn-out', 'interpersonal', 'conflicts', 'were', 'not', 'even', 'real', 'everybody', 'Joe', 'was', 'fake', 'character', 'whereas', 'IOWA', 'lot', 'more', 'variety', 'going.INVASION', 'IOWA', 'bit', 'middle', 'humor', 'wanes', 'couple', 'episodes', 'get', 'rather', 'tedious', 'Sometimes', 'INVASION', 'IOWA', 'bogged', 'down', 'showing', 'process', 'making', 'movie', 'think', 'segments', 'actress', 'Desi', 'Lydic', 'describing', 'children', 'book', 'townspeople', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'very', 'well', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'have', 'strut', 'more', 'eye-popping', 'alien', 'outfit', 'Yum', 'Yum', 'However', 'end', 'INVASION', 'IOWA', 'up', 'steam', 'again', 'culminating', 'episode', 'where', 'Shatner', 'beans', 'townspeople', 'just', 'fake', 'tenth', 'final', 'episode', 'fake', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'making.All', 'INVASION', 'IOWA', 'fun', 'interesting', 'mini-series', 'do', 'recommend', 'not', 'just', 'William', 'Shatner', 'fans', 'anyone', 'who', 'reality', 'TV']",Invasion Iowa

1238896,AEV640MKB3I9J,B001UIY5HA,Hank Drake,"[16, 16]","Riverside, Iowa is purported to be the town where in the future, James T. Kirk will be born.  It seemed inevitable that William Shatner would show up there sooner or later.  But only Shatner could have pulled off this stunt.  Pretending to be making a sci-fi film using locals, Shatner and his eccentric entourage (improvisational actors playing his dim-witted nephew, buxom ditzy costar, and new age guru) descend on Riverside and commence the wackiest production imaginable.Spoilers:Most of the townsfolk seem only too happy to work on the production and indulge Shatner's eccentricities, which include eating off other people's plates, plugging his own brand of berets, and covering for another star's kleptomania.  A younger local suspects very early on that this is a Reality TV gimmick, and he promptly disappears from the production.Shatner is game throughout, bonding with the people of Riverside and displaying none of the aloofness that some of his Trek costars have accused him of.  He befriends an older man named Don at the local diner (even consenting to having his forehead ""blessed"" by Don's good luck charm which is made from a raccoon's...anatomy).  When they go to visit Don's wife's grave, Shatner, a widower himself, seems genuinely moved.  During the course of his visit, the entourage gets the local townsfolk to open up and discuss their hopes and dreams.  And when the hoax is revealed, most of the locals are relieved that it's a Reality TV stunt, because the ""movie"" they're working on is obviously horrible.  Shatner nearly breaks down in tears as he presents gifts to his new friends, especially the local cue-card holder who is trying to adopt her grandchild.There are parts midway through the series that drag a bit.  On the whole, however, it's worth sticking with Invasion Iowa for the payoff.
