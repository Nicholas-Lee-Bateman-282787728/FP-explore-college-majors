A fictional team-up of Wild Bill Hickok, and Crazy Horse. But this review is about the poorly done DVD let me go point by point:Picture: Good, I watched the movie on a blue-ray player with a HDMI hookup. The quality of the non-blue ray movie was good, an excellent transfer, that kept with the dark mood of the picture. However, its fullscreen only, in a movie that would've benefited from widescreen.Extras: None...zip....nothing...no trailer, no setup, no menu, NOTHING! Even if the trailer been lost, there is so much history, documentaries, film on Hickok, Crazy Horse, the west, even on the Bozeman trail. Another good extra would've been about western slang, which the film is filled with.

286192,A3QIW6ULPIPM2V,630197719X,Chip Kaufmann,"[17, 18]","A decidedly odd combination to be sure but that was my impression after seeing this atypical Charles Bronson Western again after more than 30 years (I first saw it on its original release in 1977). The supernatural elements of the story along with the unreal reality of some of the lighting and use of color recall such Hammer horrors as THE GORGON and THE BRIDES OF DRACULA. The beauty of some of the images and the uneven editing resemble the later films of D.W. Griffith. Portions of the movie were even filmed where Griffith shot the battles for BIRTH OF A NATION back in 1914. The town sequences were shot at a Western museum in Colorado while most of the mountain scenes were shot in New Mexico. The sometimes jarring editing, lapses in continuity, and occasional sloppiness are typical of director J. Lee Thompson's (THE GUNS OF NAVARONE, CAPE FEAR) later films probably the results of tight budgets. A good example of this is Jack Warden's glass eye make-up which changes from scene to scene. Sometimes he doesn't appear to be wearing any make-up at all. But these are minor distractions. Thompson's pace is excellent. He knows how to move the film along while staging his action set pieces effectively.The setting is 1874 during the gold rush that took place in the Black Hills of South Dakota. Wild Bill Hickok (Bronson) has come there not for gold but to find a monster white buffalo which has been haunting his dreams. He has syphilis (""caught a cold in the pants that won't go away"" is how it's described) and needs to wear shades to protect his eyes. Chief Crazy Horse (Will Sampson) also seeks the white buffalo to avenge the death of his child and regain his lost honor. Take this storyline, add a number of seasoned performers like Slim Pickens, Clint Walker, and Kim Novak, along with Paul Lohmann's striking cinematography and you have a Western unlike any other. The film flopped on its original release and it's not hard to see why. Too strange for Western purists, not enough action for Bronson fans, and bad word of mouth about the title animal (which was mechanical not CGI) kept people away. Looked at today the unreal quality of the buffalo fits the dreamlike nature of the film and several striking images such as the mountain of buffalo bones and the cave scenes linger in the memory long afterwards. THE WHITE BUFFALO is another in the new MGM DVD-R series of requested but previously unreleased films which means no extras of any kind but the widescreen transfer is gorgeous and John Barry's vivid score sounds as haunting as ever",4,Hammer Films Meets D.W.

This is the first time I've seen it some thirty years on and I still like it but with reservations.  I think as a teenager I viewed it as a monster-western and that may explain the appeal.  The film now strikes me as a character study of two sworn enemies Wild Bill Hickok(Charles Bronson) and Crazy Horse (Will Sampson) bound together by their pursuit of an elusive quarry.  The acting of both men is quite good but I think their characters are underwritten which I think lies in the script.  It may also lie with the film's relatively brief running time of 97 minutes.  If ever a film deserves an expanded director's edition ""The White Buffalo"" is it.  Then of course there's the methaphorical title animal.  The creature effects are so ridiculous, though the sound effects are good, that it doesn't really suggest the terror the buffalo strikes in men's hearts.  Despite these qualms I highly recommend the film.  It's an ambitious film as opposed to being a pretentious or ponderous one.

Well being a Charles Bronson fan, I had to go check this out. The Ramada Inn had a welcome sign for the crew. I went in to the hotel and they gave me the location where they were filming. My wife and I drove out to Red Canyon which was probably twenty minutes away and there we came upon the set. We saw Bronson, Warden, and Will Sampson. Bronson had long white hair which surprised me when the movie came out. The weather was great that day in April and I watched the scene where the indians were all standing across the canyon yelling on the rocks while Bronson and Warden stayed low across from them.The next day, we went back and it snowed like crazy and I guess that is when they filmed the snow scenes. I was glad to see Clint Walker in a film since he hadn't been in one for awhile. We never bothered any of the cast. Warden, Sampson, and some Indians came over and spoke since we were the only ones there that weren't part of the crew.

It stars  Charels Bronson, Will Sampson and Jack Warden in Dino De Laurentis' bigger than life production. It's the story of 'Wild' Bill Hickok and Chief Crazy Horse supposedly based on a true event where the two men met to fight the same nightmare that haunted them both. At this time, Hickok was dying from syphillis and Crazy horse would soon fight his last battle. The two men become friends as they hunt the White Spike. Hickok because he is terrified of the nightmares he has of it and Crazy Horse to wrap his child killed by the Buffalo as it stampeded through his village. Crazy horse must wrap the child in the white buffalo hide so she can enter the Great Indian after-Life. Jack Warden is also along as Hickok's best friend, although his reasons are monetary only.  The White Buffalo, built by Carlo Rambaldi, has been said to appear fake on the screen, but this two ton terror appears real enough to bring chills to you as it terrorizes the western mountains. Rambaldi wanted to achieve a 'dream-like' effect since both men were hunting a 'nightmare. He has more than succeeded. In the end both Hickok and Crazy Horse both bring it down and Hickok loses his friend Jack Warden because he gives the hide to Crazy Horse, a hide that would have brought $2000 back then. It is also when Crazy Horse finds out his 'friend' is the one and only Wild Bill Hickok, enemy of his people for shooting their Peacemaker years ago. Crazy Horse says, though they part as 'brothers, they will never meet that way again. Richard Sales did much research on the two 'brothers' and the story is sworn to be true. In the end, Hickok and Crazy Horse die the same year, each by violent methods. A plus in this film, although a small role, is the beautiful Kim Novak as ""Poker Jenny"", a love of Hickoks. This film is  a DVD-R version, but even though worthy of being released as a regular DVD, the picture and sound are absolutely perfect.

John Barry's solid musical score also lends it credibility.What makes this film so attractive isn't the fact that Bronson plays the lead role.  It's the supporting cast that gives this film an initial degree of respectability.  Clint Walker is convincing as the disgruntled Whistling Jack who has a score to settle with Bill.  Slim Pickens (Blazing Saddles & Dr. Strangeglove) is at his cowboy best as the stage coach driver and John Carradine gives a nice cameo as the town undertaker.  But its Will Sampson (One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest) who gives a standout performance as Chief Crazy Horse.  However, I'm not sure this movie would warrant a repeat performance without his presence.olofpalme63",3,the assassination of the mechanical cow,1162339200,"11 1, 2006",2006,1268,"['Charles', 'Bronson', 'vehicle', '1977', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'can', 'get', 'cheap', 'looking', 'mechanical', 'bull', 'Directed', 'J.Lee', 'Thompson', 'Kinjite', 'forbidden', 'subjects', 'also', 'starred', 'Bronson', 'written', 'screen', 'Richard', 'Sale', 'based', 'own', '1975', 'White', 'Buffalo', 'legendary', 'Wild', 'Bill', 'Hickok', 'Chief', 'Crazy', 'Horse', 'clash', 'alleged', 'dispute', 'albino', 'buffalo', 'Fact', 'folklore', 'was', 'Jack', 'Wardens', 'character', 'Charlie', 'Zane', 'really', 'sidekick', 'Wild', 'Bill', 'poor', 'special', 'effects', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'underlying', 'appeal', 'John', 'Barry', 'solid', 'musical', 'score', 'also', 'film', 'so', 'attractive', ""n't"", 'fact', 'Bronson', 'lead', 'role', 'supporting', 'cast', 'film', 'initial', 'degree', 'respectability', 'Clint', 'Walker', 'convincing', 'disgruntled', 'Whistling', 'Jack', 'who', 'score', 'settle', 'Bill', 'Slim', 'Pickens', 'Blazing', 'Saddles', 'Dr.', 'Strangeglove', 'cowboy', 'best', 'stage', 'coach', 'driver', 'John', 'Carradine', 'nice', 'cameo', 'town', 'undertaker', 'Will', 'Sampson', 'One', 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'who', 'standout', 'performance', 'Chief', 'Crazy', 'Horse', 'However', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'movie', 'would', 'warrant', 'repeat', 'performance', 'presence.olofpalme63']",N/A

As it is, I still admire this odd, surreal western monster movie. It has more in common with Moby Dick than Jaws, with its various characters pushed onward by fate, following nightmares and omens to their respective destinies, which is what attracted me to it in the first place. It also features some of the greatest western slang I have ever had the pleasure of hearing;the script by Richard Sale is a marvel of cowpoke linguistics. Admittedly, Charles Bronson is best when he is silent and here he is as verbose as you will ever hear him but he seems to really shine through in an oddly human and likable way when he is acting opposite Will Sampson. Jack Warden seems to take extra special delight in handling his dialogue with a curmudgeonly precision and it is delicious.I grew up in a rural Pacific Northwest town--I know my redneck and cowboy talk and their attendant mannerisms--so trust me when I say that the dialogue alone in this film makes it worth viewing; this is as close to cowboy poetry as you'll ever hear. But you also get this giant monster buffalo that never manages to look like anything other than a big mechanical puppet--but that doesn't detract from the pleasure of this film one bit! I would venture to praise some of the quick-cutting and crazy dolly shots used in the sequences with the animatronic beast, which comes across marvelously well in conjunction with the bellowing roar it is given by the sound effects department and John Barry's ominous score.I have seen this film several times and the buffalo always surprises me by its effectiveness; it has its place in my fond memories alongside the mutated bear in John Frankenheimer's unjustly lambasted PROPHECY.",5,"like the song by Ted Nugent, this movie rocks!,",1139270400,"02 7, 2006",2006,1819,"['like', 'movie', 'lot', 'wish', 'had', 'seen', 'when', 'was', 'younger', ""'m"", 'sure', 'would', 'have', 'even', 'firmer', 'place', 'heart', 'still', 'admire', 'odd', 'surreal', 'western', 'monster', 'movie', 'more', 'common', 'Moby', 'Dick', 'Jaws', 'various', 'characters', 'pushed', 'onward', 'fate', 'following', 'nightmares', 'omens', 'respective', 'destinies', 'what', 'attracted', 'first', 'place', 'also', 'greatest', 'western', 'slang', 'have', 'ever', 'had', 'pleasure', 'hearing', 'script', 'Richard', 'Sale', 'marvel', 'cowpoke', 'linguistics', 'Admittedly', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'best', 'when', 'silent', 'here', 'as', 'verbose', 'will', 'ever', 'hear', 'really', 'shine', 'oddly', 'human', 'likable', 'way', 'when', 'acting', 'opposite', 'Will', 'Sampson', 'Jack', 'Warden', 'take', 'extra', 'special', 'delight', 'handling', 'dialogue', 'curmudgeonly', 'precision', 'delicious.I', 'grew', 'up', 'rural', 'Pacific', 'Northwest', 'town', 'know', 'redneck', 'cowboy', 'talk', 'attendant', 'mannerisms', 'so', 'when', 'say', 'dialogue', 'alone', 'film', 'worth', 'viewing', 'as', 'close', 'cowboy', 'poetry', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'hear', 'also', 'get', 'giant', 'monster', 'buffalo', 'never', 'look', 'anything', 'other', 'big', 'mechanical', 'puppet', ""n't"", 'detract', 'pleasure', 'film', 'one', 'bit', 'would', 'venture', 'praise', 'quick-cutting', 'crazy', 'dolly', 'shots', 'used', 'sequences', 'animatronic', 'beast', 'marvelously', 'well', 'conjunction', 'bellowing', 'roar', 'given', 'sound', 'effects', 'department', 'John', 'Barry', 'ominous', 'score.I', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'several', 'times', 'buffalo', 'always', 'effectiveness', 'place', 'fond', 'memories', 'mutated', 'bear', 'John', 'Frankenheimer', 'unjustly', 'lambasted', 'PROPHECY']",N/A

286229,A220FJEQNGMSRN,630197719X,Trevor Willsmer,"[3, 3]","Something of a rarity these days, The White Buffalo is the kind of film that almost inevitably disappoints first time round but improves immensely on second viewing with revised expectations. Certainly casting Charles Bronson as Wild Bill Hickok sets up a lot of expectations that the film defies. His regular fans in the 70s probably WEREN'T expecting Bronson to play a haunted man with syphilis and fading eyesight hiding behind dark glasses and a false name from his nightmares of approaching death in the form of a giant white buffalo. While the film does provide a fair bit of action, it's not a typical western adventure, and while it's one of Dino De Laurentiis post-Jaws big beast movies (King Kong, Orca), it's not exactly a western Moby Dick either.Haunted by dreams of a white buffalo charging at him and hoping to try his luck in the Black Hills gold rush, Hickok and ornery sidekick Jack Warden find themselves hunting the last white `spike' with Will Sampson's Crazy Horse, who's also hiding behind an assumed name until he can reclaim his own by wrapping the body of his dead child in the skin of the white buffalo that killed it so its spirit can rest in peace. It's a curious kind of quest: neither man really hates the beast but need to kill it to find some kind of peace of mind - rather than glory or adventure, it's an attempt to defeat death, though it's only a momentary reprieve. Both men are hunted themselves by foes old and new along the way, but as John Barry's dark and brooding score makes clear, their own legends are probably their biggest enemies as they approach extinction themselves. Unfortunately it never really makes enough of its own potential: it's certainly no The Last Hunt and it's tempting to think what a director like Richard Brooks or a younger Sam Peckinpah could have made of the material.Technically it has its fair share of problems. It would be kind to describe much of the film's look as `stylised' when in reality large parts of the exterior scenes have very obviously been shot on soundstages and backlots with Paul Lohmann's cinematography making no attempt to give the illusion of shooting on location or even matching shots with the genuine location scenes. The buffalo itself is one of Carlo Rambaldi's better animatronic creations and even has a surprisingly good running motion, but though generally fairly well shot it's one film where some fluid CGi might have genuinely helped give the beast a bit more flexibility. It has a fine cast of familiar faces - Slim Pickens as a stagecoach driver, John Carradine as an undertaker (""You better lay them out in the snow until I get back. That will keep them fresh""), Stuart Whitman as a drunken no-account gambler, Kim Novak as Poker Jenny, Ed Lauter as Tom Custer and Clint Walker as Hickok's latest adversary - but there's often the feeling that they're used to add colour rather than substance to the mix. Yet though the film may never quite work anywhere near as well as it could, it's an interesting ride off the beaten trail that offers the odd striking moment like the heaps of millions of buffalo bones stacked up by the railroad tracks and has some marvellously literate language to savour. It's not the most accomplished of Bronson's collaborations with director J. Lee Thompson, but it is the most interesting.

Looks like the major studios are opting for selling DVD-R's now.  I made the mistake to order Lee Van Cleef's El Condor 'DVD-R on Demand' from the Warner Brothers 'archive' program and it played with digital artifacts up to the halfway point at which it stopped playing altogether. I see from some of the other MGM Archive title reviews that many are experiencing the same poor playback issues from the MGM 'Burn on Demand' titles as well.  Maybe they could use some tips from the real bootleggers...As far as the film itself, classic!!  It is not a strait-forward western, it is more a mystical,surreal adventure tale dealing with the psychology of legends and the myth-isism and ending of the old west. Bronson as Hickock is as the old White Spike himself - the last of a dying breed and the end of an era, hiding his own legend behind dark sunglasses as the buffalo hides his legend in the camoflouge of the snow covered mountains.The stellar cast of actors includes Bronson, Will Sampson, Stuart Whitman, Slim Pickens, Clint Walker, Jack Warden and Kim Novak.  All are written great character parts and the script uses some of the most authentic sounding Old West dialouge I think I've ever heard in any western to date.  Just listen to the words and phrases used to described things and events.  The  dialouge/hand gestures of the natives were superior as well.  Great research and writing on somebodys part.There's lotsa talk about the Spike not looking real, but as I see this film, it was never supposed to look so real and works well within this context.  Sure it's limited 70's effects, but check out the original poster artwork, the buffalo is twenty feet tall. It's not even believed by townsfolk that a white buffalo still exists.  The Buffalo represents the things of dreams and nightmares, the things of which fantasy and legends are made. Like Hickock himself.  When finally confronted by the beast, Hickock hesitates in reflection and awe while the chief, who is hunting for a different reason, thinks only to kill.Also deserving mention is John Barry's creepy and mystically surreal score which is also available on limited edition CD.  Barry scored to reflect the surreal nature of the film as opposeed to a traditional western-type score.  Great decision on his part and shows he understood the true nature of the film.  Barry makes a great scoring decision and really elevates the dreamlike atmosphere of the film.MGM remastered and released The White Buffalo on official DVD in Japan waaay back in 2003 with real cover art(along with Bronson's From Noon til Three).  If MGM cant pay the US the same respect, I'll keep watching my Japanese copy. This cover art is pathetic, as with all of these archive DVDR releases.  I guess you'll have to pick it up if you don't have a copy, but I hate to see these guys encouraged with less than quality releases.Let's hope the remaining unreleased Bronson films, Stone Killer and Noon til Three, get real releases with real transfers as opposed to this DVD-R or the recent Telefon transfer travesty.

It seems so real that he wakes up blasting his two pistols at the phantom and scaring the hell out of the people around him. There is a parallel story of Crazy Horse on a quest of revenge for the death of his small baby by a very real white buff. There is the usual cast of western charactes, the whore with the heart of gold, the cavalry, the mountain men, saloon owner and vermin and native americans. This movie is different and kind of an Ahab/Mobey Dick quest for revenge. The buffalo looks like crap but I guess compared to what they can do today it can be understandable. Bronson is great so is Jack Warden. Clint Walker makes a cameo and so does Kim Novak. And Will Sampson is just fantastic as ""Worm"" AKA Crazy Horse. Also the young guy that played Bernard Posner in Billy Jack is their as a Clint Walker lackey.",3,Moby Dick of the West!,1139011200,"02 4, 2006",2006,1121,"['liked', 'movie', 'even', 'bad', 'ways', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'excellent', 'James', 'Otis', 'A.K.A', 'Wild', 'Bill', 'Hickok', 'Seems', 'Hickok', 'caught', 'dose', 'clap', 'factually', 'correct', 'possibly', 'beginning', 'go', 'mad', 'having', 'nightmare', 'giant', 'white', 'buffalo', 'attacking', 'so', 'real', 'up', 'blasting', 'two', 'pistols', 'phantom', 'scaring', 'hell', 'people', 'parallel', 'story', 'Crazy', 'Horse', 'quest', 'revenge', 'death', 'small', 'baby', 'very', 'real', 'white', 'buff', 'usual', 'cast', 'western', 'charactes', 'whore', 'heart', 'gold', 'cavalry', 'mountain', 'men', 'saloon', 'owner', 'vermin', 'native', 'americans', 'movie', 'different', 'kind', 'Ahab/Mobey', 'Dick', 'quest', 'revenge', 'buffalo', 'looks', 'crap', 'guess', 'compared', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'today', 'can', 'be', 'understandable', 'Bronson', 'great', 'so', 'Jack', 'Warden', 'Clint', 'Walker', 'cameo', 'so', 'Kim', 'Novak', 'Will', 'Sampson', 'just', 'fantastic', 'Worm', 'AKA', 'Crazy', 'Horse', 'Also', 'young', 'guy', 'played', 'Bernard', 'Posner', 'Billy', 'Jack', 'Clint', 'Walker', 'lackey']",N/A

The verbage, weapons, clothing, styles are very near to the real west. There is a bunch of hollywood western thrown in but this is still a fun movie to watch and that is what really matters!The saloon scene with the cathouse behind blankets is the best view of the ""ladies of the West"" I've ever seen. People look used and dirty not made up and clean as in Gene Autry westerns but not as overly dirty as in ""Doc"". It does need subtitles for all the Western lingo and that is the best. I love Randolph Scott movies but can't stand the NY accent! The glasses are a nice touch since the wearing did indicate syphilis or Gonnarhea which was treated with a hot wire up my privates ala ""Wild Bill"", another great movie that The White Buffalo is on track with!
