820209,AS558SNWF1DXG,B00020HB3W,Clare Quilty,"[32, 35]","Practically everything about HBO's ""K Street"" and its run was a little odd.Produced by George Clooney and Steven Soderbergh, it was a television series that debuted in fall 2003 and centered around a political consulting firm in Washington, D.C.The cast was a mixture of actors and political figures - James Carville and Mary Matalin played fictionalized versions of themselves interacting with real congressmen, senators, lobbyists and journalists. Howard Dean, Tom Daschle, Orrin Hatch, Joe Klein and lots of others had cameos.Episodes were semi-improvised and shot quickly with a handheld camera, by Soderbergh, just a few days before the shows aired so they could incorporate current events into the plots.Cool idea. Sounds like one heck of a lot of work. And, overall, the basic idea just didn't play. The main characters often had to jump through hoops to integrate themselves into the topics and most of the politicians on-camera were uneasy and distracting. Rather than seeming ""ripped from today's headlines,"" ""K Street"" kind of felt Scotch taped to the day-before-yesterday's.But then the show started getting bizarre, and bizarre in a good way.Most TV shows have been in the can for weeks or even months by the time their reviews and ratings come out, but Soderbergh was still shooting the show as it was being panned by critics and ignored by viewers. In apparent response, the series abruptly went from being a minimalist, more cynical ""West Wing"" to behaving like a long lost Alan Pakula thriller from the '70s.The characters got creepy: Maggie (Mary McCormack) met a suitor (Talia Balsam) who came on strong and then suddenly accused her of stalking; the robotic Francisco (Roger G. Smith) deepened his secret ties to his Howard Hughesian boss (Elliott Gould), who was making deals with the Saudis; and kinky, hallucination-prone Tommy (John Slattery) slept with his father's much-younger fiance, who then killed herself in his hotel room.At the peak of all this trouble, suddenly and with no real explanation, the show ended, yanked after two-and-a-half months, supposedly by mutual agreement between HBO and Soderbergh (who, according to HBO's Web site, is still on the hook for 10 episodes of another, similar series).Good or at least interesting shows get canceled in mid-sentence all the time - c'est la vie - but now suddenly all 10 episodes of ""K Street"" have been released on DVD. This would've been a great way for Soderbergh, who does extremely funny and interesting director commentaries on most of his DVDs, toexplain the show - how and why they did it, who all the cameos are and how he convinced them to appear and, most of all, what happened in the end.  It's bound to be an equally engaging story.Unfortunately, like the series itself, the DVD is incomplete and comes with no extras at all, just 10 episodes followed by a sudden stop.",3,"A surprisingly good, complicated series; so-so DVD",1093910400,"08 31, 2004",2004,2865,"['Practically', 'everything', 'HBO', 'K', 'Street', 'run', 'was', 'little', 'odd.Produced', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'was', 'television', 'series', 'debuted', 'fall', '2003', 'centered', 'political', 'consulting', 'firm', 'Washington', 'D.C.The', 'cast', 'was', 'mixture', 'actors', 'political', 'figures', 'James', 'Carville', 'Mary', 'Matalin', 'played', 'fictionalized', 'versions', 'interacting', 'real', 'congressmen', 'senators', 'lobbyists', 'journalists', 'Howard', 'Dean', 'Tom', 'Daschle', 'Orrin', 'Hatch', 'Joe', 'Klein', 'lots', 'others', 'had', 'cameos.Episodes', 'were', 'semi-improvised', 'shot', 'quickly', 'handheld', 'camera', 'Soderbergh', 'just', 'few', 'days', 'shows', 'aired', 'could', 'incorporate', 'current', 'events', 'plots.Cool', 'idea', 'one', 'heck', 'lot', 'work', 'overall', 'basic', 'idea', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'play', 'main', 'characters', 'often', 'had', 'jump', 'hoops', 'integrate', 'topics', 'most', 'politicians', 'on-camera', 'were', 'uneasy', 'distracting', 'Rather', 'seeming', 'ripped', 'today', 'headlines', 'K', 'Street', 'kind', 'felt', 'Scotch', 'taped', ""day-before-yesterday's.But"", 'then', 'show', 'started', 'getting', 'bizarre', 'bizarre', 'good', 'way.Most', 'TV', 'shows', 'have', 'been', 'can', 'weeks', 'even', 'months', 'time', 'reviews', 'ratings', 'come', 'out', 'Soderbergh', 'was', 'still', 'shooting', 'show', 'was', 'being', 'panned', 'critics', 'ignored', 'viewers', 'apparent', 'response', 'series', 'abruptly', 'went', 'being', 'minimalist', 'more', 'cynical', 'West', 'Wing', 'behaving', 'long', 'lost', 'Alan', 'Pakula', 'thriller', ""'70s.The"", 'characters', 'got', 'creepy', 'Maggie', 'Mary', 'McCormack', 'met', 'suitor', 'Talia', 'Balsam', 'who', 'came', 'strong', 'then', 'suddenly', 'accused', 'stalking', 'robotic', 'Francisco', 'Roger', 'G.', 'Smith', 'deepened', 'secret', 'ties', 'Howard', 'Hughesian', 'boss', 'Elliott', 'Gould', 'who', 'was', 'making', 'deals', 'Saudis', 'kinky', 'hallucination-prone', 'Tommy', 'John', 'Slattery', 'slept', 'father', 'much-younger', 'fiance', 'who', 'then', 'killed', 'hotel', 'peak', 'trouble', 'suddenly', 'real', 'explanation', 'show', 'ended', 'yanked', 'two-and-a-half', 'months', 'supposedly', 'mutual', 'agreement', 'HBO', 'Soderbergh', 'who', 'according', 'HBO', 'Web', 'site', 'still', 'hook', '10', 'episodes', 'similar', 'series', '.Good', 'least', 'interesting', 'shows', 'get', 'canceled', 'mid-sentence', 'time', ""c'est"", 'la', 'vie', 'now', 'suddenly', '10', 'episodes', 'K', 'Street', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'great', 'way', 'Soderbergh', 'who', 'extremely', 'funny', 'interesting', 'director', 'commentaries', 'most', 'DVDs', 'toexplain', 'show', 'how', 'why', 'did', 'who', 'cameos', 'are', 'how', 'convinced', 'appear', 'most', 'what', 'happened', 'end', 'bound', 'be', 'equally', 'engaging', 'story.Unfortunately', 'series', 'DVD', 'incomplete', 'extras', 'just', '10', 'episodes', 'followed', 'sudden', 'stop']",K Street - The Complete Series

820214,A3RS0HI0DUS4GV,B00020HB3W,J. Schell,"[0, 6]","I bought this because I was looking though a list of HBO shows and this one had mildly good ratings on Amazon.  Plus it was only $2 + $3 shipping.  It was a $5 mistake.  I only watched the first episode, but it was full of unamusing banter, terrible picture quality, and weird camera angles.They spent about 1/3 of the episode with a lady telling other people that James Carville was not, absolutely not, representing their non-partisan firm in his coaching of Howard Dean.  She made this very clear to different people several times over the episode.  Another significant portion of the episode was spent watching a younger dc newcomer be odd and interact awkwardly with people.  The last third was watching James Carville chum around with people.  But there's no clever back and forth banter.  It's more like a bunch of random frat brothers or army buddies talking about people you don't know.  In an Army movie you'd have the serious guy, the funny guy, the sociopath, etc.  And watching those extreme characters clowning around might be interesting.  Watching a bunch of politicians palling around is absolutely not interesting.Also the dvd's picture quality was terrible and the camera angle for some reason was often that of a very short person struggling to peer over a desk.",1,Not worth the $5 I paid,1289865600,"11 16, 2010",2010,1282,"['bought', 'was', 'looking', 'list', 'HBO', 'shows', 'one', 'had', 'mildly', 'good', 'ratings', 'Amazon', 'was', 'only', '2', '+', '3', 'shipping', 'was', '5', 'mistake', 'only', 'watched', 'first', 'episode', 'was', 'full', 'unamusing', 'banter', 'terrible', 'picture', 'quality', 'weird', 'camera', 'angles.They', 'spent', '1/3', 'episode', 'lady', 'telling', 'other', 'people', 'James', 'Carville', 'was', 'not', 'absolutely', 'not', 'representing', 'non-partisan', 'firm', 'coaching', 'Howard', 'Dean', 'made', 'very', 'clear', 'different', 'people', 'several', 'times', 'episode', 'significant', 'portion', 'episode', 'was', 'spent', 'watching', 'younger', 'dc', 'newcomer', 'be', 'odd', 'interact', 'awkwardly', 'people', 'last', 'third', 'was', 'watching', 'James', 'Carville', 'chum', 'people', 'clever', 'back', 'forth', 'banter', 'more', 'bunch', 'random', 'frat', 'brothers', 'army', 'buddies', 'talking', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Army', 'movie', ""'d"", 'have', 'serious', 'guy', 'funny', 'guy', 'sociopath', 'etc', 'watching', 'extreme', 'characters', 'clowning', 'around', 'might', 'be', 'interesting', 'Watching', 'bunch', 'politicians', 'palling', 'around', 'absolutely', 'not', 'interesting.Also', 'dvd', 'picture', 'quality', 'was', 'terrible', 'camera', 'angle', 'reason', 'was', 'often', 'very', 'short', 'person', 'struggling', 'peer', 'desk']",K Street - The Complete Series

First episode was incomprehensibly dull. It didn't seem to be about anything, just a lot of dull, inane semi-comprehensible banter and forced laughing. It's behind the scenes political stuff, but only stuff that's so minor and inane that I can't imagine anyone actually caring about it or finding it interesting. I figured the whole series would follow suit, and be about the lead up to the 2004 election, so I was pleasantly surprised when the focus ended up being on other aspects of what the PR company does, and the next couple episodes were actually about something. Those things being the mp3 sharing copyright infringement issue, and whether the PR company should represent a Saudi Arabian organization. Episodes two and three stand out from the rest as being pretty interesting. After that it gets a bit convoluted again. A lot of the show is edited so you don't know what's happening while you're watching it, and you get to piece it together later to some extent when a later scene gives it context, but about a quarter, maybe a third of the content, never slots into place. The last episode is almost the most random of the bunch, giving very little closure to the fractured plotlines that had been building up until that point. The show, i guess, is very experimental, the experiment being how little can you show and how non-linear can your editing be while still conveying a comprehensible narrative, and in my opinion the result of the experiment is you can't push it as far as this show did. When half the scenes leave you asking ""what was that about?"" and trying to examine the details of what was said to work out which part was pertinent, that's more work than watching a tv program should be.
