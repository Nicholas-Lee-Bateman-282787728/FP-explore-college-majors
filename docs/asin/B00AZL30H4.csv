1618700,A1NIGUK4M2ST8,B00AZL30H4,mk,"[9, 9]","Well shot and well meaning dramedy, slow in parts, touching in others, the Dove approved film offers tons of sentiment and a bit of romance.Recently dumped, so-so artist Sara(Emmanuelle Vaugier) hooks up with her regretful, Zumba loving mother(Shelley Long) to go back to their small home town to try and save Grandma's place from demolition and perhaps, also, the old wedding chapel.Sara, reluctantly, seeks the help of a handsome, joking, local councilman(Mark Deklin).  Meanwhile, widowed mom constantly reflects back on a love lost.  Is there a new chance of love in the air?  Stay tuned.The actors are handsome, the setting, pretty; Shelley Long, who has been doing a lot of these mother roles lately, gets to do more in this one.  She still has that almost whining, sarcastic come back voice that was so funny in Cheers.  The script here is weak, and my wife kept saying, ""How sappy!""; however, she did want to see how things turned out, even though, I think it's quite predictable but sweet.There are several improbable scenes: *SPOILER ALERT* For example, no way would they tear down that beautiful chapel; Also, the daughter gets thrown in jail for ""trespassing"", donning the prison overalls and all, just so they can show a cutesy scene with the hunky, loving it, councilman. *END ALERT*Overall, not really a romantic comedy, but a good enough, clean, relationship flick, if you can accept the flaws, to relax on the sofa with your sweetie.

1618701,A3AI1MEAEZ7SLZ,B00AZL30H4,MOSasha,"[0, 0]",I bought this DVD because I liked many of the actors from seeing them on TV or in other movies.  Yet the good old days are not always that good and actors change too.  I also think the chemistry between many of the actors just wasn't there.  The movie kept falling flat for me and slow paced in areas and just way off in others.  The reason I watched the whole thing is because I was working in my bedroom and had it for background noise.  I also kept thinking it would get better because I liked the main actors in other movies.
