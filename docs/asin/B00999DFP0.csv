1589576,A179KKM2KF56D1,B00999DFP0,hunter s burroughs,"[0, 6]","technically i should've given this review 3-stars (5 stars for each o' the 1st 3 seasons, and 1 star each for seasons 4 & 5......divided by 5 = 3.4), but i chose to xploit the fact that no one had written anything for the 2-star slot, so 2 stars became the shortest distance......anywayno doubt i'm in the minority here, but i lament the unquestionable loss o' that which made this series truly unique in the 1st place, that which has been steadily losing momentum during the last 2 seasons (and no doubt is continuing to occur in season 6)i don't always collect things sequentially; so this last xmas i was sent the one season i was missing - s2.  i had picked up s5 while i was visiting family in october cause i actually found a copy for $25 (not even on amazon was that possible back then).  however i held off watching it until i returned home, i even watched disk 4 o' s4 to help set the stage.....however s5 failed to really hold my attention - even after repeated viewing. in fact since then i had also been watching s4 more in an effort to want to like it; yet it simply never solidified into anything i could recommend.  sure there are sporadic moments which made me laugh, but the direction o' the show had quantifiably shiftedin between watching s5 and the arrival o' s2 i read an article in an ish o' entertainment, and while i found myself disagreeing w/ much the author had to say about the show it wasn't until i received s2 and popped in the 1st disk that my suspicions were utterly confirmed.......the all too predictable focus on relationship conundrums has been steadily eroding the ONLY interesting aspects o' what made this series genuinely original in the 1st place; and if they don't find a way to bring it back then i'm most likely going to give away the last 2 seasons, cause they really aren't as engaging as the first 3.  like many who instantly gravitated to the series i LOVED all the scientific references, the `inside' math jokes, even the cursory celebrations o' nerd culture (despite the heavy-handed emphasis o' dc over marvel); but sadly BBT has become much more about the most superficial trappings o' nerdom rather than about mining the precious nuggets o' humor based on the actual glories o' math & science - and even their awkward xtrapolations into the amerikan social spheres.  it's no accident that their oft touted impressive leap (almost quantum-like given the arena in which it occurred) in viewership coincided precisely during the season when the math & science took an unmistakable backseat to the stereotypical plights o' relationship foibles - that tried & true safe constant o' ALL popular sitcoms.  personally i don't give a lab rat's ass if leonard and penny EVER hook up, they so aren't ross & rachel - that high-water mark which nearly every romantic probability will forever be compared.  however let us not forget that what made this show such a singular phenomenon in the 1st place was the fascinating interactions o' a gaggle o' PhD holders (and their plus one MIT graduate) and their erratic orbits around one another; the pole-star being a particularly eccentric `alpha' nerdit's bad enough our country scores so low against other nations in the disciplines o' math & science, must we also dumb down our writing skills to cater to such pathetically low xpectations ???",2,the diminishing returns paradox,1358812800,"01 22, 2013",2013,3331,"['technically', 'i', 'should', ""'ve"", 'given', 'review', '3-stars', '5', 'stars', 'o', '1st', '3', 'seasons', '1', 'star', 'seasons', '4', '5', 'divided', '5', '=', '3.4', 'i', 'chose', 'xploit', 'fact', 'one', 'had', 'written', 'anything', '2-star', 'slot', 'so', '2', 'stars', 'became', 'shortest', 'distance', 'doubt', 'i', ""'m"", 'minority', 'here', 'i', 'lament', 'unquestionable', 'loss', 'o', 'made', 'series', 'truly', 'unique', '1st', 'place', 'been', 'steadily', 'losing', 'momentum', 'last', '2', 'seasons', 'doubt', 'continuing', 'occur', 'season', '6', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'collect', 'things', 'sequentially', 'so', 'last', 'xmas', 'i', 'was', 'sent', 'one', 'season', 'i', 'was', 'missing', 's2', 'i', 'had', 'picked', 'up', 's5', 'i', 'was', 'visiting', 'family', 'october', 'cause', 'i', 'actually', 'found', 'copy', '25', 'not', 'even', 'amazon', 'was', 'possible', 'back', 'then', 'however', 'i', 'held', 'off', 'watching', 'i', 'returned', 'home', 'i', 'even', 'watched', 'disk', '4', 'o', 's4', 'help', 'set', 'stage', '..however', 's5', 'failed', 'really', 'hold', 'attention', 'even', 'repeated', 'viewing', 'fact', 'then', 'i', 'had', 'also', 'been', 'watching', 's4', 'more', 'effort', 'want', 'like', 'simply', 'never', 'solidified', 'anything', 'i', 'could', 'recommend', 'sure', 'are', 'sporadic', 'moments', 'made', 'laugh', 'direction', 'o', 'show', 'had', 'quantifiably', 'shiftedin', 'watching', 's5', 'arrival', 'o', 's2', 'i', 'read', 'article', 'ish', 'o', 'entertainment', 'i', 'found', 'disagreeing', 'w/', 'much', 'author', 'had', 'say', 'show', 'was', ""n't"", 'i', 'received', 's2', 'popped', '1st', 'disk', 'suspicions', 'were', 'utterly', 'confirmed', '.the', 'too', 'predictable', 'focus', 'relationship', 'conundrums', 'been', 'steadily', 'eroding', 'ONLY', 'interesting', 'aspects', 'o', 'what', 'made', 'series', 'genuinely', 'original', '1st', 'place', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'way', 'bring', 'back', 'then', 'i', ""'m"", 'most', 'likely', 'going', 'give', 'away', 'last', '2', 'seasons', 'cause', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'engaging', 'first', '3.', 'many', 'who', 'instantly', 'gravitated', 'series', 'i', 'LOVED', 'scientific', 'references', 'inside', 'math', 'jokes', 'even', 'cursory', 'celebrations', 'o', 'nerd', 'culture', 'heavy-handed', 'emphasis', 'o', 'dc', 'marvel', 'sadly', 'BBT', 'become', 'much', 'more', 'most', 'superficial', 'trappings', 'o', 'nerdom', 'rather', 'mining', 'precious', 'nuggets', 'o', 'humor', 'based', 'actual', 'glories', 'o', 'math', 'science', 'even', 'awkward', 'xtrapolations', 'amerikan', 'social', 'spheres', 'accident', 'oft', 'touted', 'impressive', 'leap', 'almost', 'quantum-like', 'given', 'arena', 'occurred', 'viewership', 'coincided', 'precisely', 'season', 'when', 'math', 'science', 'took', 'unmistakable', 'backseat', 'stereotypical', 'plights', 'o', 'relationship', 'foibles', 'tried', 'true', 'safe', 'constant', 'o', 'ALL', 'popular', 'sitcoms', 'personally', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'lab', 'rat', 'ass', 'leonard', 'penny', 'EVER', 'hook', 'up', 'so', 'are', ""n't"", 'ross', 'rachel', 'high-water', 'mark', 'nearly', 'romantic', 'probability', 'will', 'forever', 'be', 'compared', 'however', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'what', 'made', 'show', 'singular', 'phenomenon', '1st', 'place', 'was', 'fascinating', 'interactions', 'o', 'gaggle', 'o', 'PhD', 'holders', 'one', 'MIT', 'graduate', 'erratic', 'orbits', 'one', 'pole-star', 'being', 'particularly', 'eccentric', 'alpha', 'nerdit', 'bad', 'enough', 'country', 'so', 'low', 'other', 'nations', 'disciplines', 'o', 'math', 'science', 'must', 'also', 'dumb', 'down', 'writing', 'skills', 'cater', 'such', 'pathetically', 'low', 'xpectations']",N/A

1589583,A1CDNTB7377YH2,B00999DFP0,Michael A. Newman,"[7, 9]","When this show started out I thought it would not last beyond a season. Four super-smart ""geeky"" guys who love to go to the comics store and love to quote Star Trek and debate philosophical issue regarding superheroes trying to connect with the unreachable hot blonde next door. Well the writers of this series keep coming up with new and hilarious new avenues for this show that never seems to get boring.What is always constant among these characters is both their hatred towards Sheldon, the self-centered egotist who slings insults without a second thought and whose mind that can solve string theory, cannot fathom the most mundane things regarding human interaction. As each of the characters has an innate desire to slay this ""major annoyance,"" they are also inexplicably drawn to him, no matter what ""detailled contracts"" he makes them sign or iron clad rules he makes them follow (each day is assigned a specified meal and activity).The stories keep evolving for the better, whether it be learning that alcohol can allow Raj to talk to girls, having a Wil Wheaton/ Sheldon Cooper rivalry, finding the perfect woman for Sheldon via an on-line dating service (Amy), having Sheldon and Penny sing ""Soft Kitty,"" having Raj's parents appearring only via Skyppe or whether it's knock ""Penny,"" knock, ""Penny,"" knock, ""Penny!""And now the show is into its sixth season and nobody cares that the elevator is still out of order! Some of the best scenes happen when they are walking up or down those several flights (how did they move that Time Machine up the stairs?).TBS seems to have a few nights of marathan episodes each week and I can watch them back to back without getting bored. While a show like Modern Family is funny, the shows seem to all be the same and the characters have not really evolved since the first episode. With TBBT we see Amy evolving to becoming more human and little by little we see Sheldon start to change (he did get jealous of Amy's date with Stuart). Penny has learned to accept Sheldon's quirks and occasionally Raj will slip and talk in front of a girl sans alcohol. I don't think we will ever see Howard's mother on-screen though but we do know that the two people that tame Sheldon are his mother and his twin sister.I hope the writers can keep up the excellent job on this show for seasons to come and that the actors realize what they have now and don't decide to jump ship just yet.",5,The Best Television Comedy Since Seinfeld!,1359417600,"01 29, 2013",2013,2420,"['When', 'show', 'started', 'out', 'thought', 'would', 'not', 'last', 'season', 'Four', 'super-smart', 'geeky', 'guys', 'who', 'love', 'go', 'comics', 'store', 'love', 'quote', 'Star', 'Trek', 'debate', 'philosophical', 'issue', 'regarding', 'superheroes', 'trying', 'connect', 'unreachable', 'hot', 'blonde', 'next', 'door', 'Well', 'writers', 'series', 'keep', 'coming', 'up', 'new', 'hilarious', 'new', 'avenues', 'show', 'never', 'get', 'always', 'constant', 'characters', 'hatred', 'towards', 'Sheldon', 'self-centered', 'egotist', 'who', 'insults', 'second', 'thought', 'mind', 'can', 'solve', 'string', 'theory', 'can', 'not', 'fathom', 'most', 'mundane', 'things', 'regarding', 'human', 'interaction', 'characters', 'innate', 'desire', 'slay', 'major', 'annoyance', 'are', 'also', 'inexplicably', 'drawn', 'matter', 'what', 'detailled', 'contracts', 'sign', 'iron', 'clad', 'rules', 'follow', 'day', 'assigned', 'specified', 'meal', 'activity', '.The', 'stories', 'keep', 'evolving', 'better', 'be', 'learning', 'alcohol', 'can', 'allow', 'Raj', 'talk', 'girls', 'having', 'Wil', 'Wheaton/', 'Sheldon', 'Cooper', 'rivalry', 'finding', 'perfect', 'woman', 'Sheldon', 'on-line', 'dating', 'service', 'Amy', 'having', 'Sheldon', 'Penny', 'sing', 'Soft', 'Kitty', 'having', 'Raj', 'parents', 'appearring', 'only', 'Skyppe', 'knock', 'Penny', 'knock', 'Penny', 'knock', 'Penny', 'now', 'show', 'sixth', 'season', 'nobody', 'cares', 'elevator', 'still', 'order', 'best', 'scenes', 'happen', 'when', 'are', 'walking', 'up', 'several', 'flights', 'how', 'did', 'move', 'Time', 'Machine', 'stairs', '.TBS', 'have', 'few', 'nights', 'marathan', 'episodes', 'week', 'can', 'watch', 'back', 'back', 'getting', 'bored', 'show', 'Modern', 'Family', 'funny', 'shows', 'seem', 'be', 'same', 'characters', 'have', 'not', 'really', 'evolved', 'first', 'episode', 'TBBT', 'see', 'Amy', 'evolving', 'becoming', 'more', 'human', 'little', 'little', 'see', 'Sheldon', 'start', 'change', 'did', 'get', 'jealous', 'Amy', 'date', 'Stuart', 'Penny', 'learned', 'accept', 'Sheldon', 'quirks', 'occasionally', 'Raj', 'will', 'slip', 'talk', 'front', 'girl', 'alcohol', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'Howard', 'mother', 'on-screen', 'do', 'know', 'two', 'people', 'tame', 'Sheldon', 'are', 'mother', 'twin', 'sister.I', 'hope', 'writers', 'can', 'keep', 'up', 'excellent', 'job', 'show', 'seasons', 'come', 'actors', 'realize', 'what', 'have', 'now', 'do', ""n't"", 'decide', 'jump', 'ship', 'just', 'yet']",N/A

1589587,A74TA8X5YQ7NE,B00999DFP0,NeuroSplicer,"[0, 0]","In the cult tradition of Spartacus, the halls of every science department now echoes: ""I AM SHELDON""!Currently into its sixth season, The Big Bang Theory proved to be one of the most funny TV sitcoms ever aired. Even if the show seems to have slowed down form its initial explosive impetus, I had not laughed out loud this hard ever since the best days of Frasier and Seinfeld - and Big Bang Theory is consistently brilliant!Sheldon Cooper is unavoidably the king of the show - the massive black hole this Universe revolves around if you will. A child prodigy, now a 24 years old theoretical physicist PhD with absolutely no social skills or known sexual drive. Sheldon may be on the verge of unifying the fields but cannot drive a car to save his life or break a smile even remotely resembling that of a mere homo sapiens.His equally super-intelligent (yet sexually confused at times girlfriend), Amy Farrah Fowler, received a far more enlarged role since the fifth season. However, she was not a very good addition and she unbalances the show. Her character only manages to blur the focus form Sheldon (there is only room for one idiosyncratic genius!), diffuse a number of comically charged situations and gum up the show's flow.Leonard Hofstadter is Sheldon's roommate and primary ...keeper. An experimental physicist himself (who Sheldon tries to ""help"" by steering him towards a teaching career), he juggles Sheldon's idiosyncrasies with his personal neurosis - not to mention his crush on his neighbor Penny. Which crush, like lunar eclipses, follow a predicted yet unavoidable periodicity.Leonard tried his hand in a long-distance relationship with his friend Raj's sister, Priya, but he seems to be gravitating back towards Penny once more.Howard Wolowitz is the only one with no PhD (and Sheldon will never let him forget it). An engineer (whose crowning achievements were a mechanized arm that is used in the space shuttle and a liquid waste management solution), he also managed to wreck the Mars Rover in hopes of landing a girl (but he made sure no one can prove anything).The fact that he is a short man with a severely outdated and misguided sense of fashion, still lives with his mother, insists on using a collection of pickup lines straight from men's magazines advice columns - and yet carries himself as God's gift to women is just hilarious.Howard used to be the show-stealer. Whenever he entered the scene you just knew he would offer such an outrageous perceptive that would render you speechless. Now, if only Howard's character was allowed to continue in its stellar trajectory. He has been weighted down by his fianc&eacute;e, Bernadette, who is very likeable, but also is cramping his style. Not to mention that she, slowly yet inescapably, is turning into his scary mother.Rajesh Koothrappali is a particle astrophysicist with a fashion sense close to absolute zero and a severe case of shyness - to the point that he cannot speak in front of women unless inebriated. He takes the ""metrosexual"" lifestyle a little too literal for his own good and he keeps using the ""poor Indian"" defense even if his father is a rich doctor who drives a Bentley. His character, even in the current sixth season, remains underdeveloped.Then there is Penny. She is the proverbial good girl next door who came to California with stardom aspirations but so far works as waitress and suffers a sequence of bad boyfriends (Sheldon has in fact calculated the exact number of them, extrapolated from a bell-curve that started at 14)- and, obviously, from her neighbors.The show unavoidably makes use of previous sitcom combinations (the odd couple, the unfulfilled love-interest mismatch, the fish-out-of-the-water) but even if one manages to discern them they are used in such a fresh manner that all that is left is great entertainment!The way to truly enjoy this is to own it on DVD. The writing is so smart and the jokes fly so fast (many of them non-verbal) there is just no way to savor it during its weekly air time. Well, may be Sheldon could but then again, who can compare his intellect with his?HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",5,A WHOLE NEW UNIVERSE OF INTELLIGENT LAUGHS!,1355011200,"12 9, 2012",2012,4129,"['cult', 'tradition', 'Spartacus', 'halls', 'science', 'department', 'now', 'AM', 'SHELDON', 'Currently', 'sixth', 'season', 'Big', 'Bang', 'Theory', 'proved', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'funny', 'TV', 'sitcoms', 'ever', 'aired', 'Even', 'show', 'have', 'slowed', 'down', 'form', 'initial', 'explosive', 'impetus', 'had', 'not', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'hard', 'ever', 'best', 'days', 'Frasier', 'Seinfeld', 'Big', 'Bang', 'Theory', 'consistently', 'brilliant', 'Sheldon', 'Cooper', 'unavoidably', 'king', 'show', 'massive', 'black', 'hole', 'Universe', 'will', 'child', 'prodigy', 'now', '24', 'years', 'old', 'theoretical', 'physicist', 'PhD', 'absolutely', 'social', 'skills', 'known', 'sexual', 'drive', 'Sheldon', 'may', 'be', 'verge', 'unifying', 'fields', 'can', 'not', 'drive', 'car', 'save', 'life', 'break', 'smile', 'even', 'remotely', 'resembling', 'mere', 'homo', 'sapiens.His', 'equally', 'super-intelligent', 'yet', 'sexually', 'confused', 'times', 'girlfriend', 'Amy', 'Farrah', 'Fowler', 'received', 'far', 'more', 'enlarged', 'role', 'fifth', 'season', 'However', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'addition', 'show', 'character', 'only', 'blur', 'focus', 'form', 'Sheldon', 'only', 'room', 'one', 'idiosyncratic', 'genius', 'number', 'comically', 'charged', 'situations', 'gum', 'up', 'show', 'flow.Leonard', 'Hofstadter', 'Sheldon', 'roommate', 'primary', 'keeper', 'experimental', 'physicist', 'who', 'Sheldon', 'help', 'steering', 'towards', 'teaching', 'career', 'Sheldon', 'idiosyncrasies', 'personal', 'neurosis', 'not', 'mention', 'crush', 'neighbor', 'Penny', 'Which', 'crush', 'lunar', 'eclipses', 'follow', 'predicted', 'yet', 'unavoidable', 'periodicity.Leonard', 'tried', 'hand', 'long-distance', 'relationship', 'friend', 'Raj', 'sister', 'Priya', 'be', 'gravitating', 'back', 'towards', 'Penny', 'once', 'more.Howard', 'Wolowitz', 'only', 'one', 'PhD', 'Sheldon', 'will', 'never', 'let', 'forget', 'engineer', 'crowning', 'achievements', 'were', 'mechanized', 'arm', 'used', 'space', 'shuttle', 'liquid', 'waste', 'management', 'solution', 'also', 'managed', 'wreck', 'Mars', 'Rover', 'hopes', 'landing', 'girl', 'made', 'sure', 'one', 'can', 'prove', 'anything', 'fact', 'short', 'man', 'severely', 'outdated', 'misguided', 'sense', 'fashion', 'still', 'mother', 'using', 'collection', 'pickup', 'lines', 'straight', 'men', 'magazines', 'advice', 'columns', 'yet', 'God', 'gift', 'women', 'just', 'hilarious.Howard', 'used', 'be', 'show-stealer', 'Whenever', 'entered', 'scene', 'just', 'knew', 'would', 'offer', 'such', 'outrageous', 'perceptive', 'would', 'render', 'speechless', 'Now', 'only', 'Howard', 'character', 'was', 'allowed', 'continue', 'stellar', 'trajectory', 'been', 'weighted', 'down', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Bernadette', 'who', 'very', 'likeable', 'also', 'cramping', 'style', 'Not', 'mention', 'slowly', 'yet', 'inescapably', 'turning', 'scary', 'mother.Rajesh', 'Koothrappali', 'particle', 'astrophysicist', 'fashion', 'sense', 'close', 'absolute', 'zero', 'severe', 'case', 'shyness', 'point', 'can', 'not', 'speak', 'front', 'women', 'inebriated', 'metrosexual', 'little', 'too', 'literal', 'own', 'good', 'using', 'poor', 'Indian', 'defense', 'even', 'father', 'rich', 'doctor', 'who', 'Bentley', 'character', 'even', 'current', 'sixth', 'season', 'underdeveloped.Then', 'Penny', 'proverbial', 'good', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'who', 'came', 'California', 'stardom', 'aspirations', 'so', 'far', 'waitress', 'sequence', 'bad', 'boyfriends', 'Sheldon', 'fact', 'calculated', 'exact', 'number', 'extrapolated', 'bell-curve', 'started', '14', 'obviously', 'neighbors.The', 'show', 'unavoidably', 'use', 'previous', 'sitcom', 'combinations', 'odd', 'couple', 'unfulfilled', 'love-interest', 'mismatch', 'fish-out-of-the-water', 'even', 'one', 'discern', 'are', 'used', 'such', 'fresh', 'manner', 'left', 'great', 'entertainment', 'way', 'truly', 'enjoy', 'own', 'DVD', 'writing', 'so', 'smart', 'jokes', 'fly', 'so', 'fast', 'many', 'non-verbal', 'just', 'way', 'savor', 'weekly', 'air', 'time', 'Well', 'may', 'be', 'Sheldon', 'could', 'then', 'again', 'who', 'can', 'compare', 'intellect', 'HIGHLY', 'RECOMMENDED']",N/A
