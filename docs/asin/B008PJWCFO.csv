It was the worst acting I've every seen.  It's like they gave them the script and ran thur it once and then used a video camera in their home and did it.

1574065,A48C8M5OM9ETJ,B008PJWCFO,"prince of reviews ""Jack""","[0, 0]","This movie is about a boy who has known for a long time that he is gay. It is not like other foreign gay movies like You Are not Alone and North Sea Texas where two boys kiss each other and other stuff. I love the part where the boy was writing a short story about this little prince who was also gay and wanted to be accepted by his mother. The boy tries a suicide but is saved. The mother is learning to come to terms with her son's gay nature (and is going through therapy). This movie is very short. In fact it is long enough to be put on as a one hour TV program. 47 minutes long. And add plenty of commercials.Addendum: I have seen this movie about the forth time. I have read some of the criticisms and all I got to say is, to each his own. That is why I say rent first, then buy if you like it. Besides today's movies cost like eleven to twelve dollars to see at a movie theater. A rental with Amazon is like what it would cost a person to see that movie in the 1970's at your favorite theater. Best of all you can turn a movie off when you have to make a phone call or go to the bathroom. Despite this movie being low budget it is still enjoyable to me. I don't ask anything more from a movie than to be entertaining.",5,"I love this short gay movie (watch first, then rent if you like it)",1401321600,"05 29, 2014",2014,1226,"['movie', 'boy', 'who', 'known', 'long', 'time', 'gay', 'not', 'other', 'foreign', 'gay', 'movies', 'Are', 'not', 'Alone', 'North', 'Sea', 'Texas', 'where', 'two', 'boys', 'kiss', 'other', 'other', 'stuff', 'love', 'part', 'where', 'boy', 'was', 'writing', 'short', 'story', 'little', 'prince', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'gay', 'wanted', 'be', 'accepted', 'mother', 'boy', 'suicide', 'saved', 'mother', 'learning', 'come', 'terms', 'son', 'gay', 'nature', 'going', 'therapy', 'movie', 'very', 'short', 'fact', 'long', 'enough', 'be', 'put', 'one', 'hour', 'TV', 'program', '47', 'minutes', 'long', 'add', 'plenty', 'commercials.Addendum', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'forth', 'time', 'have', 'read', 'criticisms', 'got', 'say', 'own', 'why', 'say', 'rent', 'first', 'then', 'buy', 'like', 'today', 'movies', 'cost', 'eleven', 'twelve', 'dollars', 'see', 'movie', 'theater', 'rental', 'Amazon', 'what', 'would', 'cost', 'person', 'see', 'movie', '1970', 'favorite', 'theater', 'Best', 'can', 'turn', 'movie', 'off', 'when', 'have', 'make', 'phone', 'call', 'go', 'bathroom', 'movie', 'being', 'low', 'budget', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'anything', 'more', 'movie', 'be', 'entertaining']",N/A
