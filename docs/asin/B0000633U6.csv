Henry Casey is looking after Jack's claim and White Fang after Jack finally moves to San Francisco. He meets a native girl who convinces him to search for Caribou. And...that's it when it comes to plot.It's very, very slow and doesn't really build up to much. There are still some lovely views and scenery but the scope is lost, and even White Fang himself has a diminished presence and function.Overall White Fang 2 feels and looks a lot like a Disney Channel TV and not like a theatrical movie.
