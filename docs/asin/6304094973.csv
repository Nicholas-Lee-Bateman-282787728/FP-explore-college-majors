400837,A199545U14YERT,6304094973,"#1 Kiss Army Soldier ""Ramiro""","[4, 4]","Me and my brother Daniel used to watch this one DAILY. We laughed from beggining to end. I'm telling you, if you like those crazy movies that makes you pee your panties, than I think this one is probably one of the best. Chris Farley: My favorite comedy actor (rest in peace) stars on this one with David Spade. I strongly suggest you watch this flick if you're in the mood for ""HAHAHAs"".CHRIS FARLY IS THE BEST !!!!!!!!!!!P.S.- If you loved this one, then I suggest you watch the following ones too:- ""Tommy Boy"".- I haven't watched this one and it is with Chris Farley and David Spade. Some people think this movie is Farley's best movie he made. WOW. If ""Black Sheep"" is one of the best, then imagine how this one would be!!!!! For what I heard: 10/10.- ""Beverly Hills Ninja"".- I watched this one and I think it is another one of my all-time favorite's. This one is another movie in which Farley stars in. It will make you laugh you're a** off.- 10/10.- ""Almost Heroes"".- Farley's last movie staring with ""Friends"" star Matthew Perry (I love that T.V. show). Not as funny as the other ones listed above, but also one of my favorite's.- 9/10.- ""Dirty Work"".- One of the best.

400838,A13QNGUB9IYTY4,6304094973,"A Hermit ""J.Hamric""","[1, 1]","""Black Sheep"" is merely a retooling of ""Tommy Boy,"" but in cases like this, it doesn't matter. It was made purely for laughs, not to make a statement or impress with a display of great scriptwriting. ""Tommy Boy"" has a far superior script, and despite several flaws in the screenplay and continuity, it was a genuinely good movie, on every level. This one was simply made for a quick buck, and some laughs. It piggy-backed on the other's success.First, let me state the obvious: The Spade-Farley team was right up there with all the great comedy teams of the ages. The physical differences, as well as everything else. Spade - short and little, caustic wit, a mean streak, really snarky: Farley - big, obese, low-brow approach (though he himself was bright, he played stupid very well), affable and friendly, a loose cannon. Look at the others - Laurel and Hardy, Abbot and Costello, Aykroyd and Belushi and so on. They fit the template. But it ended way too soon. Farley left us way too soon, and he was one of the funniest human beings of all time. And Spade just added to it.""Black Sheep"" has a fairly simple premise: Mike Donnelly (Farley) is the underachieving train-wreck brother of Al Donnelly, a rare person. He is an actual honest politician. (The writers of this movie wisely avoided party politics; it's up to the viewer to decide who is the conservative and who is the liberal. They avoided this altogether. That would have been a mistake which would have nose-dived this picture right into the ground.) But Mike wants to help his brother win the election, no matter what he has to do to get this done. The story pairs him with David Spade, on a series of misadventures which are genuinely funny, especially as executed by these two comic geniuses.The opening scene is proof that sometimes pure nonsense, depicted with no explanation whatsoever, can leave one rolling with laughter. Farley is driving the campaign vehicle through town, making announcements to the public about Al Donnelly's candidacy for governer, but for some completely unknown reason, all the unleashed dogs in town are following the truck, barking as if they were on a wild pack's hunt. ""...WHAT'S WITH THESE DOGS?!..."" He can't shake them, and ultimately wrecks the truck, and suddenly, the dogs just cool it. There's no back story, no explanation, but it is hilarious nonetheless.Throughout, Farley's ""Mike"" character suffers mishap after mishap, some of which could result in serious bodily injuries, and where I don't much care for slapstick, it's impossible to not laugh at it all. And Farley often did his own stunts as well. It's amazing, what he put himself through, willingly, to make his audience laugh.Watching this, the time really does go by, quickly.

It's a shame that he was succumbed to a drug overdose on December 18, 1997 and was found dead in his apartment. Do yourself a favor and don't do drugs. They f**k you up. Also donate to the Chris Farley Foundation, which is run by Farley's two brothers. Comedy is good for you, drugs aren't.Anyways, ""Black Sheep"" is hilarious. Yes, David Spade returns as Steve to babysit clumsy oaf Mike Donnelhy (Farley) while Mike's brother, Al, runs for Washington state governor. The movie really gets rolling when Steve and Mike stay at a lodge in the woods of Washington. When a boulder rolls down and hits the house, making it slide down the grade, everything moves, except the refrigerator, which is held in by the plug, until it is unplugged and slammed against Mike, who then says, ""I've got a bowl of chocolate pudding down my pants."" Steve responds, ""We didn't have any pudding in there.""Another crackup is when Mike calls top bunk, but in the middle of the night, the roof blows off and it hails inside. While Mike is being pelted by hail, Steve laughs and teases him by mimicing, ""I call top bunk."" Pretty soon, the top bunk lands on Steve.I don't want to spoil the movie any more than I did, but you need to watch this for yourself.

400855,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,6304094973,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[2, 3]","In 1996, ""Saturday Night Live"" comedians Chris Farley and David Spade teamed up once again for ""BLACK SHEEP"".  With the success of ""Tommy Boy"" (1995), the stars joined ""WAYNE'S WORLD"" director Penelope Spheeris (""Little Rascals"", ""Beverly Hillbillies"", ""The Decline of Western Civilization Part II and Part III"", etc.) and writer Fred Wolf (""Joe Dirt"", ""Without a Paddle"", ""Strange Wilderness"", etc.).The film was not well-received and the late film critic Gene Siskel said this film was one of the two films he has ever walked out on.  The film grossed around over $32 million during its theatrical run.The film revolves around Mike Donnelly (Chris Farley), the loving brother of Al Donnelly (Tim Matheson) who is running for Governor of Washington.  Unfortunately, Mike is very clumsy and seems to have his share of bad luck.While Al is giving a speech, Mike who is driving a rundown vehicle with a loudspeaker (asking for people to vote for his brother).  But the neighborhood dogs are following the vehicle, so Mike decides to find a way to ditch them.  First he starts yelling into the mic with no success and then he starts to outrun them.  Unfortunately, he loses control of the vehicle and destroys parking meters, cars and runs straight into the town's movie theater, right in front of where his brother is giving a speech.Al's political campaign manager Roger Kovary (Timothy Carhart) advises Al that his brother is bringing shame to the campaign and that he may need someone to watch over him.  So, Steve Dodds (David Spade), a campaign aide volunteers to watch over Mike.Steve's first impression of Mike is in disbelief as he is covered in oil and slams the hood of the car he is repairing on his own fingers.  During a campaign promotional, Mike tries to help an old couple with their groceries (even if they don't want it) and gets his tie caught in the trunk and is dragged all over the parking lot.  When Steve goes to pick Mike up, he accidentally hits a veteran's car, Drake Sabitch (Garey Busey).  Because of that, Sabitch steals Steve's car.Now, it seems that with Steve near Mike, he may get a taste of his bad luck.  To make things worse, Mike gets in more trouble as he tries to stop kids from drinking alcohol and ends up being photographed by the local paper as a guy who supports underage kids from drinking.  Mike is fired from the county's REC center.Noticing Mike's continuing troublesome nature, Governor Evelyn Tracy (Christine Ebersole) who is running against Al, decides to go dirty in her campaign and bring shame to Al Donnelly by framing Mike with an accident. Hoping that Mike would be a distraction to her rival.Tracy has two men commit arson by burning the REC center but to make it look like Mike did it as retaliation for being fired.  Steve arrives to the scene and is shocked to see the whole REC burning and is not too sure if Mike did it or not, even if Mike tells him that he didn't do it. Fortunately for Mike, his cop buddy Robby Mighuem (Grant Heslov) arrives to the scene first and tells Mike to leave and he won't tell anyone that they were at the premises.Roger advises Al that because of all the trouble Mike is bringing to the campaign, his idea is to have Mike brought to an area where he can't cause any trouble since they are now in the final stage of the campaign, weeks before the election date.  So, Steve brings Mike to a secluded area in the mountainside and with nothing but a cabin nearby, what problem can the two have?  Unfortunately, with Mike's bad luck, trouble will always follow.Can Mike stay away long enough from making things worse for his brother's campaign?VIDEO & AUDIO:""BLACK SHEEP"" is featured in 1080p High Definition and because the film was shot primarily outdoors, the picture quality features a lot of vibrant colors.  Typically with many films released between the late 80's and mid-90's, there is a softness that comes with the picture quality on Blu-ray, and color is often muted.  But for this 13-year-old film, picture quality is pretty good compared to the original DVD.Audio is featured in English 5.0 Dolby TrueHD (and French 2.0 Dolby Surround and Spanish 5.0 Dolby Digital).  The film is primarily front channel heavy and as a comedy film, is primarily dialogue based.  But because you have well-known rock n' roll director Penelope Spheeris in control, her films tend to utilize music and in this case, during the grunge era, this film features the band Mudhoney.  Dialogue is clear and there are a few cases of action sequences, especially during a scene when a big boulder crashes down into the cabin that Mike and Steve are staying in.  But for a comedy film, audio quality is satisfactory.Subtitles are featured in English, English SDH, French, Spanish and Portuguese.SPECIAL FEATURES:The ""BLACK SHEEP"" Blu-ray Disc release does not contain any special features.JUDGMENT CALL:""BLACK SHEEP"" is a film that you either love or hate.  Where SNL alumni Mike Myers and Dana Carvey dominated the early 90's with ""WAYNE'S WORLD"", SNL team Chris Farley and David Spade followed in the mid-90's with a few films.Chris Farley's comedy is self-deprecating as he knows how to utilize his body weight to showcase clumsiness and moronic behavior quite well for the role of Mike Donnelly.  Where David Spade is more calm and collected in this film, Farley really goes all out and he makes his scenes of bad decision making seem plausible because he is so clumsy.And because of that, many critics tend to be disgusted by this style of comedy, while there are those who saw his comedy as genius and a man who knew how to win the audience.  He will be a talent remembered for comedy films like ""BLACK SHEEP"", ""Tommy Boy"" and ""Beverly Hills Ninja"".With that being said, ""BLACK SHEEP"" is definitely a film which you can't be too serious about, nor can you be logical and wonder how Mike gets away with all this trouble and destruction. You just take it in as a comedy where you just wonder how far Chris Farley will go with his hilarious and wacky antics.As for the Blu-ray, if you own the DVD, there is not much extra to expect from this Blu-ray release.  There are no special features and the sound is 5.0 Dolby TrueHD (no subwoofer utilization).  So, it all comes down to picture quality and if that is enough for you to double dip.""BLACK SHEEP"" may not be for everyone but if you are familiar with the style of Happy Madison Production type of films or Chris Farley films in general, you know what to expect.",3,Blu-ray: A hilarious Farley/Spade film but a blu-ray that is bare bones!,1242691200,"05 19, 2009",2009,6490,"['1996', 'Saturday',

First and foremost, DO NOT compare this movie to TOMMY BOY because when you do, most of the time people get disappointed. Seriously, take BLACK SHEEP as it is because this is a funny movie.Farley is Mike Donnelly and his brother Al is running for Senator in Washington state. When Al's political advisor suggests that Mike go on a hands on political movement to some small towns in rural Washington. Al feeling that it would be a good idea so Mike doesn't bumble anything up, he sends another one of his assistants, Steve Dodge (David Spade) with him. In laugh out loud Farley and Spade manner, they deliver some really good laughs and a total jab at politics.Like I said before, don't compare this to TOMMY BOY. BLACK SHEEP is it's own movie and not a carbon copy of a previous idea. This movie delivers some really good laughs like the concert scene, when the kids beat up Spade and who could forget the police car scene? Trust me, the style of comedy is way different in this one.Seriously, you should pick this one up. It's really funny and enjoyable.

400883,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,6304094973,Robert Badgley,"[1, 2]","Black Sheep(released Feb/96)was the second vehicle that starred SNL alumni Chris Farley and David Spade,the first having been Tommy Boy.Both were successes at the box office,but this film is straining for laughs at most times.SNL creator Lorne Michaels was at the helm but the I-can-see-this-joke-coming-a-mile-away thing is just beaten to death here.Farley's familiar gesticulations coupled with his screaming at the top of his voice ""Oh my God"" or ""Stawwp!"" with a red face,may have worked well in other venues but they fall flat here.Spade here is comedically neutered;his sharp ""counter-punches"" have been turned into wrist slaps.I recall that the filming of this was less than a pleasant experience for all involved,especially the writer,director,producer and Spade.It's a wonder it got made at all,with the off screen acrimony to have seemingly contributed to the lacklustre end product.The story is a simple one.A candidate for Governor of Washington one Al Donnelly(Tim Matheson,who starred in a spate of frat house films in the /80s),as a younger brother Mike played by Chris Farley who is kind of the ""black sheep"" of the family;a good hearted guy but kind of a bull in a china shop and stumble bum.A man on Al's campaign staff Steve Dodds(Spade)offers to keep an eye on Al's brother until the campaign is over.While driving into town Steve gets his car taken by a local recluse named Drake Sabbitch(played with great elan by Gary Busey),after he insults him.In no time it seems Steve has got his hands full with Mike as one faux paux follows quickly after yet another.On top of this two things are on the go:a couple of snoopy reporters are following Mike and Steve getting compromising pictures of Mike and the incumbent governor who Al is running against,is playing dirty ball by fixing votes and trying to play up Mike's bumbling for public consumption.While up in the boonies Steve and Mike run across Steve's stolen car at Drake's house but end up getting jumped by him.As Sabbitch leans hard on Steve,Mike comes to the rescue with some good take down moves and the two become instant friends.A plan is formulated to get hard evidence against the governor and her staff and to hi-jack her conference in Olympia,along with the help of Drake.They crash the conference and after Mike crashes to the ground from the top of a remote TV aerial,he takes a security guards gun and takes Steve as his hostage,to gain attention.Joined on the podium is Drake.Between them  they prove beyond a doubt the fraud that has been perpetrated on the voters.As the film ends Mike and Al are back as family should be and as Mike sees his brothers small jet off,his coat gets caught in the door and off he flies with his brother-on the outside of course.Juvenile jokes galore such as:Farley ""falling"" down a mountain side,with his ""memorable"" line at the bottom""What was with that?"",a large stone sitting precariously above the cabin that you just KNOW is going to come down on the cabin at some point and does,miniatures of the cabin at night with the roof blowing off then Farley above Spade in a bunk bed when it hails through the open roof,and on and on.Regarding this last one,it is another perfect example of how Spade's counterpoint lacks any punch and the overall gag falls flat.When it hails he asks Farley in the bunk above him how the weather is ""up there"",as Farley gets pummeled by ever deepening hail.It is not the usual biting sarcasm we are used to from Spade and when Farley's upper bunk inevitably gives out(as we know it will)and smunches Spade,any laugh that ever was in that set up,is fully dissipated.And of course we have the ""beautiful"" line when Farley is driving a police cruiser,is stopped and is talking to a another policeman,with Spade as his ""prisoner"",pointing to Spade he says"" He...butchered 400 chickens and crewed a beagle"".Memorable,no?.....NO!Technically speaking the DVD is in w/s format and the picture is pretty clear and the sound is good.There are no extras.All in all a disappointing Farley/Spade movie and just plain disappointing over all,especially the from the gags,which are telegraphed ahead,mostly juvenile and executed terribly.Not a great notch in the belt of the late Farley's legacy.",3,2 1/2-3

Mike can't stop getting into trouble and it makes his brother look bad as he tries to win the election. So, Al comes across Steve Dodds (Spade) and hires him to watch his brother and keep him out of trouble.As the two set out to promote Al's canadicy for governor, they get set-up for an arsenal fire by Al's opponent, the current Governor Tracy. So the two are sent out to the woods in the mountains of Washington to hide out. The cabin they stay in is falling apart. The roof flies off during a wind and hail storm and a boulder hits the house.Will Al win the election? Can Mike stay out of trouble? Find out what happens next.

Chris Farley stars as Mike Donelly, the brother of a congressman-hopeful Al Donelly, who has aspirations to go all the way to the white-house.However, one problem is Mike keeps creating diversions. He's an hilarious walking disaster, everywhere he goes there's chaos. Eventually, Al prescribes a weaselly beaurocrat called Steve Dodds (played by David Spade) to simply do one job, keep Mike out of trouble! Of-course, that seems like an easy task, but soon turns out to be really difficult. Eventually Al the congressman sends both of them into a cabin in the deep woods somewhere, hopefully out of harms reach.Things go from bad to worse as the cabin turns into a nightmare house full of bats, a roof that falls off and lets the 'elements' in and doesn't want to sit straight. They become targets of a wild war veteran and a gang aggressive kids. Mike feels so bad about it all that he gets up on stage in front of 'young voters' who were enjoying a concert and giving them an exciting prep-talk on the up[coming election until dropping one of the most embarrrassing slip of the tongue's of all political history!

With issues that are mostly story and character related, the various pieces just don't seem to fit together very well.  The script was apparently rushed, and there were some major issues between director Penelope Spheeris (Wayne's World films) and David Spade.Mike Donnelly (Farley), who works at a recreation center, is the younger brother of Al Donnelly (Tim Matheson), who is running for governor of the great state of Washington, taking on the incumbent Governor Tracy (Christine Ebersole).  Mike is well intentioned, but his screw ups are proving to be an embarrassment to the campaign, so brother Al approves of a plan to put Mike to work where he can't do any damage.  Steve Dodds (David Spade), a member of Donnelly's staff is assigned to keep Mike out of trouble, as the pair are sent to a cabin deep in Wenatchee National Forest.  There they meet Drake Sabitch (Gary Busey), a right wing type who lives in a trailer in the woods.  When the election results come in, Governor Tracy appears to have squeezed out a narrow victory, but when Mike finds evidence of voter fraud, he and Dodds race to the capitol to expose the crime.Chris Farley tries to make the most of a script that is a hodgepodge of ideas, and lacks a tight storyline.  Slapstick physical comedy is Farley's forte, and he displays these talents many times.  Unfortunately David Spade, Farley's co-star in Tommy Boy (1995), has much less to do, and isn't particularly funny, as Steve Dodds is mostly a twerp who gets squashed down by everyone, and even wets himself.  Tim Matheson is a decent actor, but he and Farley just do not match up well as brothers.  Grant Heslov as Mike's police officer buddy, provides minor comic support.  There's not much plot development regarding Governor Tracy's dirty deeds, or a teenage kid that Mike befriends.  In the end, while Chris Farley provides some funny moments, the story just seems slapped together, rattling along with a lot of loose ends.WhileBeverly Hills Ninja(1997) is a much stronger effort, as one of his four feature films, Black Sheep is probably a must see for fans of the late Chris Farley.  Almost everyone else, may want to pass on this one, which comes in at 2.5 stars.  The big man is honestly the best thing about this movie, with some slight support from Gary Busey and David Spade.",3,campaign hijinx in the evergreen state...,1313884800,"08 21, 2011",2011,2500,"['diligent', 'efforts', 'Chris', 'Farley', '1964-1997', 'who', 'most', 'movie', 'funniest', 'moments', 'Black', 'Sheep', 'substance', 'cohesiveness', 'be', 'solid', 'comedy', 'issues', 'are', 'mostly', 'story', 'character', 'related', 'various', 'pieces', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fit', 'together', 'very', 'well', 'script', 'was', 'apparently', 'rushed', 'were', 'major', 'issues', 'director', 'Penelope', 'Spheeris', 'Wayne', 'World', 'films', 'David', 'Spade.Mike', 'Donnelly', 'Farley', 'who', 'recreation', 'center', 'younger', 'brother', 'Al', 'Donnelly', 'Tim', 'Matheson', 'who', 'running', 'governor', 'great', 'state', 'Washington', 'taking', 'incumbent', 'Governor', 'Tracy', 'Christine', 'Ebersole', 'Mike', 'well', 'intentioned', 'screw', 'ups', 'are', 'proving', 'be', 'embarrassment', 'campaign', 'brother', 'Al', 'approves', 'plan', 'put', 'Mike', 'work', 'where', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'damage', 'Steve', 'Dodds', 'David', 'Spade', 'member', 'Donnelly', 'staff', 'assigned', 'keep', 'Mike', 'trouble', 'pair', 'are', 'sent', 'cabin', 'deep', 'Wenatchee', 'National', 'Forest', 'meet', 'Drake', 'Sabitch', 'Gary', 'Busey', 'right', 'wing', 'type', 'who', 'trailer', 'woods', 'When', 'election', 'results', 'come', 'Governor', 'Tracy', 'have', 'squeezed', 'out', 'narrow', 'victory', 'when', 'Mike', 'evidence', 'voter', 'fraud', 'Dodds', 'race', 'capitol', 'expose', 'crime.Chris', 'Farley', 'make', 'most', 'script', 'hodgepodge', 'ideas', 'tight', 'storyline', 'Slapstick', 'physical', 'comedy', 'Farley', 'forte', 'talents', 'many', 'times', 'Unfortunately', 'David', 'Spade', 'Farley', 'co-star', 'Tommy', 'Boy', '1995', 'much', 'less', 'do', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'funny', 'Steve', 'Dodds', 'mostly', 'twerp', 'who', 'squashed', 'down', 'everyone', 'even', 'wets', 'Tim', 'Matheson', 'decent', 'actor', 'Farley', 'just', 'do', 'not', 'match', 'up', 'well', 'brothers', 'Grant', 'Heslov', 'Mike', 'police', 'officer', 'buddy', 'minor', 'comic', 'support', 'not', 'much', 'plot', 'development', 'regarding', 'Governor', 'Tracy', 'dirty', 'deeds', 'teenage', 'kid', 'Mike', 'befriends', 'end', 'Chris', 'Farley', 'funny', 'moments', 'story', 'just', 'slapped', 'together', 'rattling', 'along', 'lot', 'loose', 'ends.WhileBeverly', 'Hills', 'Ninja', '1997', 'much', 'stronger', 'effort', 'one', 'four', 'feature', 'films', 'Black', 'Sheep', 'probably', 'must', 'see', 'fans', 'late', 'Chris', 'Farley', 'Almost', 'everyone', 'else', 'may', 'want', 'pass', 'one', '2.5', 'stars', 'big', 'man', 'honestly', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'slight', 'support', 'Gary', 'Busey', 'David', 'Spade']",Black Sheep VHS
400892,A96K1ZGW56S2I,6304094973,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[1, 1]","After their extremely funny and very successful comedy smash TOMMY BOY, Chris Farley and David Spade joined forces again and came up with BLACK SHEEP, a movie that can almost best be described as a TOMMY BOY wanna-be. In BLACK SHEEP Chris Farley plays Mike Donnelly, a simple-minded, klutzy, and sometimes off-the-handle troubled youth worker who is an embarrassment to his older brother Al (Tim Matheson) who is running for the governor of Washington. Mike really wants his brother to win and does everything he can to campaign for him, but his best intentions always seem to bring about disastrous results. In an attempt to keep Mike in check, Al's campaign managers assign aide Steve Dodds (David Spade) to take Mike to a cabin in the mountains and keep him from causing any trouble. This proves impossible to do, and Mike continues to get into trouble. However, along the way Steve and Mike uncover evidence of a fixed election and set out to bring justice.BLACK SHEEP is a water-downed version of TOMMY BOY. Chris Farley plays the dufus relative of a person of power. David Spade plays the person assigned to watch over him. The family's power is lost and Chris and Dave go on a road trip to re-establish the family's position. There are some funny moments in BLACK SHEEP, but some of them are direct copies of jokes from TOMMY BOY, while most of the others just aren't all that funny. The similarities between the two movies don't stop there. Farley plays the same football play with his youth center kids as he does while cow-tipping in TOMMY BOY and the car that Farley and Spade's characters drove in TOMMY BOY can be seen parked in front of the youth center that Mike Donnelly works at. There are even a couple of times in the movie where Farley almost refers to Spade's character as &#34;Richard&#34; (the character Spade played in TOMMY BOY).I'm a fan of Chris Farley. I think he was a comic genius that never achieved his full potential. He lost his life because of an addiction to drugs and that addiction affected much of his later work, including BLACK SHEEP.I'm not as big a fan of David Spade's, but I do enjoy many of his characters. He is at his best when he's going off on a witty, biting sarcastic rant or when he is playing over-the-top characters (e.g. MEET JOE DIRT). Unfortunately in BLACK SHEEP he really doesn't get to do either and it affects the quality of the movie.Overall, BLACK SHEEP is just an average comedy that borders on below average. The presence of Farley and Spade keep it from falling below the brink, but just barely. It's a far lesser movie than TOMMY BOY, but it is a film that illustrates the decline and fall of Farley as both a comedian and a person struggling with addiction.",3,TOMMY BOY Remake,1161648000,"10 24, 2006",2006,2726,"['extremely', 'funny', 'very', 'successful', 'comedy', 'smash', 'TOMMY', 'BOY', 'Chris', 'Farley', 'David', 'Spade', 'joined', 'forces', 'again', 'came', 'up', 'BLACK', 'SHEEP', 'movie', 'can', 'almost', 'best', 'be', 'described', 'TOMMY', 'BOY', 'wanna-be', 'BLACK', 'SHEEP', 'Chris', 'Farley', 'Mike', 'Donnelly', 'simple-minded', 'klutzy', 'sometimes', 'off-the-handle', 'troubled', 'youth', 'worker', 'who', 'embarrassment', 'older', 'brother', 'Al', 'Tim', 'Matheson', 'who', 'running', 'governor', 'Washington', 'Mike', 'really', 'brother', 'win', 'everything', 'can', 'campaign', 'best', 'intentions', 'always', 'seem', 'bring', 'about', 'disastrous', 'results', 'attempt', 'keep', 'Mike', 'check', 'Al', 'campaign', 'managers', 'assign', 'Steve', 'Dodds', 'David', 'Spade', 'take', 'Mike', 'cabin', 'mountains', 'keep', 'causing', 'trouble', 'impossible', 'do', 'Mike', 'get', 'trouble', 'However', 'way', 'Steve', 'Mike', 'uncover', 'evidence', 'fixed', 'election', 'set', 'out', 'bring', 'justice.BLACK', 'SHEEP', 'water-downed', 'version', 'TOMMY', 'BOY', 'Chris', 'Farley', 'dufus', 'relative', 'person', 'power', 'David', 'Spade', 'person', 'assigned', 'watch', 'family', 'power', 'lost', 'Chris', 'Dave', 'go', 'road', 'trip', 're-establish', 'family', 'position', 'are', 'funny', 'moments', 'BLACK', 'SHEEP', 'are', 'direct', 'copies', 'jokes', 'TOMMY', 'BOY', 'most', 'others', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'funny', 'similarities', 'two', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'stop', 'there', 'Farley', 'same', 'football', 'play', 'youth', 'center', 'kids', 'cow-tipping', 'TOMMY', 'BOY', 'car', 'Farley', 'Spade', 'characters', 'drove', 'TOMMY', 'BOY', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'parked', 'front', 'youth', 'center', 'Mike', 'Donnelly', 'are', 'even', 'couple', 'times', 'movie', 'where', 'Farley', 'almost', 'refers', 'Spade', 'character', '34', 'Richard', '34', 'character', 'Spade', 'played', 'TOMMY', 'BOY', '.I', ""'m"", 'fan', 'Chris', 'Farley', 'think', 'was', 'comic', 'genius', 'never', 'achieved', 'full', 'potential', 'lost', 'life', 'addiction', 'drugs', 'addiction', 'affected', 'much', 'later', 'work', 'including', 'BLACK', 'SHEEP.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'as', 'big', 'fan', 'David', 'Spade', 'do', 'enjoy', 'many', 'characters', 'best', 'when', 'going', 'off', 'witty', 'biting', 'sarcastic', 'rant', 'when', 'playing', 'over-the-top', 'characters', 'e.g', 'MEET', 'JOE', 'DIRT', 'Unfortunately', 'BLACK', 'SHEEP', 'really', ""n't"", 'get', 'do', 'quality', 'movie.Overall', 'BLACK', 'SHEEP', 'just', 'average', 'comedy', 'borders', 'average', 'presence', 'Farley', 'Spade', 'keep', 'falling', 'brink', 'just', 'barely', 'far', 'lesser', 'movie', 'TOMMY', 'BOY', 'film', 'decline', 'fall', 'Farley', 'comedian', 'person', 'struggling', 'addiction']",Black Sheep VHS
400893,A254Z4O7ORVL6U,6304094973,wellwellwell,"[1, 1]","I must agree with the prior two reviews.  You cannot compare this movie to ""Tommy Boy"".  And that's for two reasons: one, Chris Farley's characters are usually about the same; therefore it is hard to differentiate his movies.  And two, ""Tommy Boy"" was a breakout film for him, his best ever, and you can't expect one man to produce consistency of that caliber time and time again.  With that said, you must enjoy ""Black Sheep"" for what it is.  And what is is a hilarious movie.In the movie, Mike Donnelly (Farley) and Steve Dodds (Spade) are two very different guys.  Mike's a laughable fat guy who does everything he can to help his brother Al (Tim Matheson) win his election.  Whereas Steve Dodds is a sad crass little man who is given the job of 'servicing', so to speak, Mike on the campaign run.  As I'm sure you can imagine the servicing does not go quite as planned.  And that's where most of the movie's comedy is generated.  Mike makes many attempts to help his brother yet only seems to hurt him.  And Dobbs, along with many others, does whatever he can to keep Mike away from the campaign all-together.  It's really very sad to see the way in which Farley's character is treated.  I'm sure you'll feel bad for him, even if you didn't like the ""kill whitey"" episode.  We all know he didn't mean it.I, unlike many other fans, show great appreciation for Chris Farley's work in this movie.  The director Penelope Spheeris (who brought us such comedies as ""Wayne's World"" and ""Senseless"") does a great job in making us laugh.  Even if the laughter seems to be a quiet mirth compared to that of ""Tommy Boy"".  But I said I wouldn't comare the two, so scratch that last remark.I gave ""Black Sheep"" 4 stars because it is better than most comedies you'll find.  It's also a classic Farley movie, one that I think every fan can appreciate.  It ranks about #33 on my favorite movie list, which is pretty high looking at some of the movies which outdo it (and for those of you who have to know, ""Tommy Boy"" is #4).

We experienced the magic of the Farley/Spade comedy connection in ""Tommy Boy""; why didn't they just leave well-enough alone?  Were these guys in some alternate reality planning to become the next Dean Martin/Jerry Lewis comedy collaboration?  Granted, the movie does star Chris Farley and David Spade, so it has its moments (how could it not?).  Beyond that, ""Black Sheep"" has no rhyme or reason.
