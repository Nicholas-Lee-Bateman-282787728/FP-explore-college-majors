The acting was standard for the most part and the plot was predictable and nothing new but it was a descent watch for a lazy weekend.  A girl moves into a sortiy house and eventually members end up disappering a few days before initiation.  The sority members clearly have an inkling as to what is going on but they are unwilling to share the secret.  It is up to Samantha and her ex-boyfriend (who happens to be interested in all things metaphysical) to uncover the mystery and save the day.",4,nothing new but it was entertaining,1299456000,"03 7, 2011",2011,580,"['liked', 'well', 'enough', 'tv', 'movie', 'not', 'sex', 'nudity', 'gore', 'torture', 'acting', 'was', 'standard', 'most', 'part', 'plot', 'was', 'predictable', 'nothing', 'new', 'was', 'descent', 'watch', 'lazy', 'weekend', 'girl', 'moves', 'sortiy', 'house', 'eventually', 'members', 'end', 'up', 'disappering', 'few', 'days', 'initiation', 'sority', 'members', 'clearly', 'have', 'inkling', 'what', 'going', 'are', 'unwilling', 'share', 'secret', 'Samantha', 'ex-boyfriend', 'who', 'be', 'interested', 'things', 'metaphysical', 'uncover', 'mystery', 'save', 'day']",The Haunting Of Sorority Row

In many ways this movie is similar to the ""Sorority Row"" film released to theaters, as it features a ghostly presence of a sorority sister who died during pledge week a year earlier. As the story develops, it focuses on Samantha (played by Leighton Meester), who is adjusting to life as a pledge and life as a college student in general. The plot is really no surprise to anyone; soon after the ghostly presence reveals itself, odd things begin to happen to the girls responsible for the tragic accident.Again, if you are looking for a film with a good scary plot that does not have the cursing, blood & guts, etc. that most all slasher films do, then this would be perfect for you. But don't confuse this with the version in theaters. That film is full of R-rated material, and although both stories achieve their goal in the end, I'd give the edge to this one, because with all the partying and extracurricular stuff cut out, the story actually is easier to follow. And Meester does a fine job, giving a balanced performance between a strong young woman and a scared college girl.",4,"Fast-Paced, Crafty Little Horror Movie",1296345600,"01 30, 2011",2011,1189,"['are', 'looking', 'creepy', 'storyline', 'blood/gore', 'nudity', 'sex', 'then', 'thing', 'many', 'ways', 'movie', 'similar', 'Sorority', 'Row', 'film', 'released', 'theaters', 'ghostly', 'presence', 'sorority', 'sister', 'who', 'died', 'pledge', 'week', 'year', 'earlier', 'story', 'Samantha', 'played', 'Leighton', 'Meester', 'who', 'adjusting', 'life', 'pledge', 'life', 'college', 'student', 'general', 'plot', 'really', 'surprise', 'anyone', 'soon', 'ghostly', 'presence', 'reveals', 'odd', 'things', 'begin', 'happen', 'girls', 'responsible', 'tragic', 'accident.Again', 'are', 'looking', 'film', 'good', 'scary', 'plot', 'not', 'have', 'cursing', 'blood', 'guts', 'etc', 'most', 'slasher', 'films', 'do', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'perfect', 'do', ""n't"", 'confuse', 'version', 'theaters', 'film', 'full', 'R-rated', 'material', 'stories', 'achieve', 'goal', 'end', ""'d"", 'give', 'edge', 'one', 'partying', 'extracurricular', 'stuff', 'cut', 'out', 'story', 'actually', 'easier', 'follow', 'Meester', 'fine', 'job', 'giving', 'balanced', 'performance', 'strong', 'young', 'woman', 'scared', 'college', 'girl']",The Haunting Of Sorority Row
