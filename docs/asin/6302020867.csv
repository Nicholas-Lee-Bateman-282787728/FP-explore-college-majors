From the start, I thought something wrong as she is certainly not dressed like a professional person doing this sort of work. More like a sexy woman going to a party. In the process of trying to get close to the alleged killer, we find out she is quite a free spirit with plenty of sex and drugs with several people one who she does not know. With AIDS now days, you really think a doctor would know better. Towards the end, she hypnotized the alleged killer and finds out that he is lying. Unfortunately for me, I have been hypnotized several times and I did not find this scene particularly convincing. So I did not enjoy what was probably suppose to be the highlight.The acting, I thought was okay.

It's also provocative, it provoked me to write this bad review.  From the beginning I could tell the director, Chris Fisher, was attempting to create a stylistic film.  However, after the third pointless scene of swirling overlapping shots and panning camera work I gave up.  If you're using style, have a reason.  Style without reason is not style.  This film is one thing, if nothing else, a great lesson in how to over use overlapping shots (also known as crossdisolving shots).  Drink too much and spin around for 10 seconds and you'll get the same effect as the camera work/editing of the film.  There's so much overlapping shots in this film, there's probably 2 1/2 hours of footage on the screen in the 85 minutes that the film is.  It's full of tallent, bad tallent.  It's more about naked women, sex, and drugs than the actual story.  I expected a cheap nock-off of The Life of David Gale. I would have enjoyed that 100 times more that this.  This is bad, annoyingly bad.  Some moron wanted to make a film and got all hung up editing.  Annette Davey, the editor, should have her name removed from the film.  Unless, for some unknown reason, she's proud of her work. If I was studio head at Silver Nitrate Entertainment and somone presented me the final cut of this film, I'd have everyone and anyone associated with it fired, immediately without question.  Sony Pictures Home Entertainment made a mistake with the distribution of this film.

I was dizzy after the first 5 minutes and still manage to watch the whole movie which is a feat that i challenge anyone here to take. You would most likely turn the movie off within 10 minutes and burst out profanities in the process.The only reason i watch the whole thing not because i wanted to know about this sick killer's multiple personality defense interview but the person who was giving the interview, the ultra hot Brittany Daniel. We went gaga over her role as the devious temptress in Dawson's Creek but as a 70's chick doing the interview....OMG! It almost seems like she was enjoying the fantasy about this guy based on her expression and body movements. She was dress to kill with that 70's disco outfit. The movie scenes was accurate to the times which is a plus.Still it was a badly directed movie with horried camera work and the dialog was bad too(accurate or not) that even the lovely Brittany cannnot save.
