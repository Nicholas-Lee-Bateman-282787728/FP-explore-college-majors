833517,A20UJP1JSTIOL6,B0002HODU4,artanis65,"[3, 4]","Matheson himself had a hand in the screenplay based on his book ""I Am Legend.""  The book is as much a psychological study of a lonely man struggling to maintain his sanity in a hostile world as it is a post-apocalyptic tale about vampires.  It's hard to translate that sort of introspection to the screen, and the movie doesn't succeed very well.  Neither is the movie very scary.  In one scene in which the lead character Neville is caught outside after dark, he has little trouble dealing with the vampires.  Imagine yourself surrounded by the equivalent of sluggish, not very bright six year olds ineffectually attacking you.  The rest of the time the vampires spend shuffling around his house, beating on his door, and shouting his name.  It's unclear why he even bothers to put out garlic and mirrors as the vampires seem too feeble to break into his home.Vincent Price struggles gamely but is miscast as Neville.  The last thing you want in a movie of this kind is someone who's rather creepy himself; you want a solidly normal actor as a counterweight to the very strange world around him.  As I recall, in the book Neville is irritated by his neighbor Cortman shouting his name every night and becomes obsessed, somewhat humorously, with finding where he sleeps during the day so he can kill him; that would have given this film a little narrative drive.  As it is, Neville seems purposeless.  That's probably accurate for someone in his situation, but it's not compelling to watch.There are a few good scenes, as when he receives an unexpected visitor in the early stages of the plague and there's pathos when he finds a dog which has somehow survived. You can also see the influence of the slow moving vampires on later films like ""Night of the Living Dead.""  However, the movie has dated badly and compares unfavorably to ""The Omega Man"" and recent efforts such as ""28 Days Later.""",2,a fairly faithful adaption of the fine Richard Matheson novel,1161561600,"10 23, 2006",2006,1892,"['Matheson', 'had', 'hand', 'screenplay', 'based', 'book', 'Am', 'Legend', 'book', 'as', 'much', 'psychological', 'study', 'lonely', 'man', 'struggling', 'maintain', 'sanity', 'hostile', 'world', 'post-apocalyptic', 'tale', 'vampires', 'hard', 'translate', 'sort', 'introspection', 'screen', 'movie', ""n't"", 'succeed', 'very', 'well', 'movie', 'very', 'scary', 'one', 'scene', 'lead', 'character', 'Neville', 'caught', 'outside', 'dark', 'little', 'trouble', 'dealing', 'vampires', 'Imagine', 'surrounded', 'equivalent', 'sluggish', 'not', 'very', 'bright', 'six', 'year', 'olds', 'ineffectually', 'attacking', 'rest', 'time', 'vampires', 'spend', 'shuffling', 'house', 'beating', 'door', 'shouting', 'name', 'unclear', 'why', 'even', 'put', 'out', 'garlic', 'mirrors', 'vampires', 'seem', 'too', 'feeble', 'break', 'home.Vincent', 'Price', 'struggles', 'gamely', 'miscast', 'Neville', 'last', 'thing', 'want', 'movie', 'kind', 'someone', 'who', 'rather', 'creepy', 'want', 'solidly', 'normal', 'actor', 'counterweight', 'very', 'strange', 'world', 'recall', 'book', 'Neville', 'irritated', 'neighbor', 'Cortman', 'shouting', 'name', 'night', 'becomes', 'obsessed', 'somewhat', 'humorously', 'finding', 'where', 'day', 'can', 'kill', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'film', 'little', 'narrative', 'drive', 'Neville', 'purposeless', 'probably', 'accurate', 'someone', 'situation', 'not', 'compelling', 'are', 'few', 'good', 'scenes', 'when', 'unexpected', 'visitor', 'early', 'stages', 'plague', 'pathos', 'when', 'dog', 'somehow', 'survived', 'can', 'also', 'see', 'influence', 'slow', 'moving', 'vampires', 'later', 'films', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'However', 'movie', 'dated', 'badly', 'unfavorably', 'Omega', 'Man', 'recent', 'efforts', 'such', '28', 'Days', 'Later']",N/A
833518,AODKUG6FAKD2Z,B0002HODU4,"Bryan Byrd ""reviewer of bad films and good books""","[1, 1]","Disclaimer: I watched this film as a streaming rental, and as such cannot comment on the audio or visual qualities of this individual disc. My review is concerned with the entertainment value of the film only.Vincent Price took the first swipe at Richard Matheson'sI Am Legendin 1964, filmed in Italy with Robert Lippert's production company - and easily turned in one of the best films attached to the Lippert name that I've seen.  Price was reportedly thought of as miscast by Matheson, who had written the screenplay, and who, due to his disappointment with the final result, used a psuedonym (Logan Swanson) on the film's credits.  One of the reasons it had taken me so long to watch this film is because I figured I would agree with that opinion.  Unfortunately, and probably unfairly, I thought Price had nearly become a parody of himself by the time I began watching movies with any sort of discerning eye, and I wrote off all his films as confined to an outdated and, frankly, ridiculous period of horror.Shows what I know.  Contempt prior to investigation is never a good business model.  Anyway, back to Price and LAST MAN ON EARTH.  The story SHOULD be pretty familiar to anyone researching the item, but a quick thumbnail sketch anyway - Price, as Dr. Robert Morgan, has survived an apocalyptic plague which has killed its victims then re-animated them as vampires.  Most of the film follows Price as he struggles to survive against the hordes of what's left of humanity, as well as a lengthy flashback scene which details events leading up to plague's last days.  Approaching despair, and with little reason to keep living, he is surprised one day to find one other like himself - or is she?Often ballyhoed as inspiration for Romero and his shambling zombies inNight of the Living Dead, LAST MAN ON EARTH certainly reinforces that connection, but I think it shortchanges directer Ubaldo Ragona to simply append his movie to Romero's as a sort of footnote - which is how I perceived it up until now.  There are only a handful of horror films from this time period that I consider worthwhile in their own right, as opposed to stepping stones for other, better films later.Carnival of Soulsis one, as well as the previous mentioned NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD.  I am sure there are many others, and I'm constantly looking for them - which is why I thought it was a real treat to find another when I finally sat down and watched LAST MAN ON EARTH.Like many above-average genre films, LAST MAN - while firmly ensconced in its more fantastic elements - hits home by concentrating on the human story.  This probably the best work I've seen Price do - less theatricality, less flamboyance than I remember from his other films where he took the star turn.  He's still Vincent Price, though - he couldn't exactly escape himself.  But the central scenes in the film, when, as Dr. Morgan, he chases down the military truck which he suspects is carrying the body of his daughter are very well-done, and what makes them chilling isn't their jump-out-and-say-boo approach, but the combination of the familiar and the fantastic, and the character's all too recognizable reaction to them.By no means is the film perfect - instead, it is one of those that show periodic flashes of real depth and some stirring cinematography while mixing in other, average elements.  For instance, how much better would the film have been without Price's voice-over narration at the beginning?  Probably necessary at the time, but watch the film with the sound off for the first 10 minutes or so - is there anything he says that can't be construed from the action on screen?  And perhaps Price was miscast - I can't quite ignore his presence - but overall I was more impressed than not.Many of the more bizarre elements of this film to a viewer from the early 1960's has become conventional nowadays, almost cliche.  Since LAST MAN takes the time to explain these conventions, it's likely that some viewers might feel the film drags.  The key for me, looking at LAST MAN ON EARTH fifty years after it was first released, is that I have to work a little harder to overcome my jaded outlook - I've become so used to the shocks of modern horror that LAST MAN seems incredibly tame.  It is, that's true, but if I'm able to immerse myself in the human story, rather than the often outlandish circumstances of horror films in general, then a film may resonate on a deeper level than simply frightening (or disgusting)me.  Even with its few drawbacks, LAST MAN wisely concentrates on the plight of Dr. Robert Morgan in human terms, which is why it is still enjoyable even today.",4,Surprisingly enjoyable still today,1338768000,"06 4, 2012",2012,4646,"['Disclaimer', 'watched', 'film', 'streaming', 'rental', 'such', 'can', 'not', 'comment', 'audio', 'visual', 'qualities', 'individual', 'disc', 'review', 'concerned', 'entertainment', 'value', 'film', 'only.Vincent', 'Price', 'took', 'first', 'swipe', 'Richard', ""Matheson'sI"", 'Am', 'Legendin', '1964', 'filmed', 'Italy', 'Robert', 'Lippert', 'production', 'company', 'easily', 'turned', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'attached', 'Lippert', 'name', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Price', 'was', 'reportedly', 'thought', 'miscast', 'Matheson', 'who', 'had', 'written', 'screenplay', 'who', 'due', 'disappointment', 'final', 'result', 'used', 'psuedonym', 'Logan', 'Swanson', 'film', 'credits', 'One', 'reasons', 'had', 'taken', 'so', 'long', 'watch', 'film', 'figured', 'would', 'agree', 'opinion', 'Unfortunately', 'probably', 'unfairly', 'thought', 'Price', 'had', 'nearly', 'become', 'parody', 'time', 'began', 'watching', 'movies', 'sort', 'discerning', 'eye', 'wrote', 'off', 'films', 'confined', 'outdated', 'frankly', 'ridiculous', 'period', 'horror.Shows', 'what', 'know', 'Contempt', 'prior', 'investigation', 'never', 'good', 'business', 'model', 'Anyway', 'back', 'Price', 'LAST', 'MAN', 'ON', 'EARTH', 'story', 'SHOULD', 'be', 'pretty', 'familiar', 'anyone', 'researching', 'item', 'quick', 'thumbnail', 'sketch', 'anyway', 'Price', 'Dr.', 'Robert', 'Morgan', 'survived', 'apocalyptic', 'plague', 'killed', 'victims', 'then', 're-animated', 'vampires', 'Most', 'film', 'Price', 'survive', 'hordes', 'what', 'left', 'humanity', 'as', 'well', 'lengthy', 'flashback', 'scene', 'details', 'events', 'leading', 'up', 'plague', 'last', 'days', 'Approaching', 'despair', 'little', 'reason', 'keep', 'living', 'surprised', 'one', 'day', 'find', 'one', 'other', 'Often', 'inspiration', 'Romero', 'shambling', 'zombies', 'inNight', 'Living', 'Dead', 'LAST', 'MAN', 'ON', 'EARTH', 'certainly', 'connection', 'think', 'directer', 'Ubaldo', 'Ragona', 'simply', 'append', 'movie', 'Romero', 'sort', 'footnote', 'how', 'perceived', 'up', 'now', 'are', 'only', 'handful', 'horror', 'films', 'time', 'period', 'consider', 'worthwhile', 'own', 'right', 'opposed', 'stepping', 'stones', 'other', 'better', 'films', 'later.Carnival', 'Soulsis', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'previous', 'mentioned', 'NIGHT', 'THE', 'LIVING', 'DEAD', 'am', 'sure', 'are', 'many', 'others', ""'m"", 'constantly', 'looking', 'why', 'thought', 'was', 'real', 'treat', 'find', 'when', 'finally', 'sat', 'down', 'watched', 'LAST', 'MAN', 'ON', 'EARTH.Like', 'many', 'above-average', 'genre', 'films', 'LAST', 'MAN', 'firmly', 'ensconced', 'more', 'fantastic', 'elements', 'hits', 'home', 'concentrating', 'human', 'story', 'probably', 'best', 'work', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Price', 'do', 'less', 'theatricality', 'less', 'flamboyance', 'remember', 'other', 'films', 'where', 'took', 'star', 'turn', 'still', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'could', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'escape', 'central', 'scenes', 'film', 'when', 'Dr.', 'Morgan', 'down', 'military', 'truck', 'carrying', 'body', 'daughter', 'are', 'very', 'well-done', 'what', 'chilling', ""n't"", 'jump-out-and-say-boo', 'approach', 'combination', 'familiar', 'fantastic', 'character', 'too', 'recognizable', 'reaction', 'them.By', 'means', 'film', 'perfect', 'instead', 'one', 'show', 'periodic', 'flashes', 'real', 'depth', 'stirring', 'cinematography', 'mixing', 'other', 'average', 'elements', 'instance', 'how', 'much', 'better', 'would', 'film', 'have', 'been', 'Price', 'voice-over', 'narration', 'beginning', 'Probably', 'necessary', 'time', 'watch', 'film', 'sound', 'first', '10', 'minutes', 'so', 'there', 'anything', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'construed', 'action', 'screen', 'perhaps', 'Price', 'was', 'miscast', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'ignore', 'presence', 'overall', 'was', 'more', 'impressed', 'not.Many', 'more', 'bizarre', 'elements', 'film', 'viewer', 'early', '1960', 'become', 'conventional', 'nowadays', 'almost', 'cliche', 'LAST', 'MAN', 'time', 'explain', 'conventions', 'likely', 'viewers', 'might', 'feel', 'film', 'drags', 'key', 'looking', 'LAST', 'MAN', 'ON', 'EARTH', 'fifty', 'years', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'have', 'work', 'little', 'harder', 'overcome', 'jaded', 'outlook', ""'ve"", 'become', 'so', 'used', 'shocks', 'modern', 'horror', 'LAST', 'MAN', 'incredibly', 'tame', 'true', ""'m"", 'able', 'immerse', 'human', 'story', 'rather', 'often', 'outlandish', 'circumstances', 'horror', 'films', 'general', 'then', 'film', 'may', 'resonate', 'deeper', 'level', 'simply', 'frightening', 'disgusting', 'Even', 'few', 'drawbacks', 'LAST', 'MAN', 'wisely', 'plight', 'Dr.', 'Robert', 'Morgan', 'human', 'terms', 'why', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'even', 'today']",N/A

Titled ""L'Ultimo Uomo della Terra"" [same meaning] where it was made in Italy, this film is initially powered by Vincent Price's soliloquy to get the narration going as this film creeps along. Largely due to Vincent Price's efforts, SOMEHOW THIS FILM WORKS!We hear and see how in a post-epidemic Earth scientist Robert Morgan (Vincent Price) is the one man immune to a plague that has transformed all of humankind that has survived into vampire-like creatures. Morgan becomes the vampire-hunter while the few remaining half-alive mutant vampires live in fear of him. He is alone and in his despair we see through his eyes how the plague developed just 3 years earlier and how his best friend became one of the monsters that now stalks him by night. The flashback ends with Morgan recalling how his wife returned from the grave after he had just buried her, calling him by name as she menacingly approached him. This was creepy stuff.At this point, now back to the present, Morgan finds a puppy. After adopting the dog as his own, Morgan finds that he too is a plague victim. After the dog's hair begins falling out, we move on to the next scene which shows Morgan burying the puppy covered with a white sheet with a stake through it. I admit it was pretty obvious, but effectively pathetic nonetheless. Then Morgan has a real break and meets one of the human ""survivors"". He actually cures this zombie, Ruth (Franca Bettoja), with a transfusion of his blood. For the first time in over three years there seems to be hope.This story is based on Richard Matheson's dark novel ""I Am Legend"". In 1971, this story was remade as ""The Omega Man"" with Charlton Heston in the Vincent Price role. ""The Omega Man"" seems over-the-top compared to this more modest effort and Price does an excellent job of making the bleakness look real and appropriate.DVD WIDESCREEN EDITION:This particular editon is an excellent widescreen presentation that I purchased to replace a rather poor video edition.

833523,AZ1UFPNARPZD2,B0002HODU4,"Jeffrey Ellis ""bored recluse""","[1, 2]","Set in the near future, the Last Man on Earth tells the story of Morgan (Vincent Price), a former scientist who also happens to be the last man on Earth.  The rest of humanity has been wiped out by a mysterious plague that has also caused the dead to apparently come back to life as mindless, psuedo-vampires.  Now, Morgan spends his days tracking down and killing these vampires and his nights locked away in his home while his former friends and neighbors gather outside and call for his blood.  As Morgan desperately searches for both a cure to the plague and other uninfected humans, he finds himself having to battle both the vampires outside his house and the isolation within.The Last Man on Earth was the first film to be made from Richard Matheson's brilliant revisionist vampire novel, I am Legend.  Over the years, Last Man On Earth has developed an undeservedly negative reputation.  While it is a very flawed film and certainly doesn't begin to equal the genius of Matheson's novel, the Last Man on Earth isn't quite as bas as you might believe.  It's true that the story does drag at certain points and, in a role that would have been perfect for Peter Cushing, Vincent Price is seriously miscast.  That shouldn't be taken to mean that Price gives a bad performance.  With the exception of a few over-the-top voiceovers, Price is actually rather restrained and believable in the leading role and he creates a very real feeling of loss and isolation.  Perhaps his most effective scene is one where he silently stands before the grave of a stray dog that he had adopted only to discover that its blood carried the vampire virus.  Price, to his credit, takes the scene and the character's feelings seriously here and, as a result, a scene that could have been laughably obvious is instead very effective.  As well, the film is visually very strong, giving the audience a haunting and believable picture of a world that has been deserted by its creators.

You know this isn't your ordinary mid-sixties black and white horror film -- a clear inspiration for Night of the Living Dead and 28 Days Later -- or your typical over-the-top Vincent Price performance.  It opens with a bleak cityscape, a post-apocalyptic vision of burned out cars and corpses.  Something awful has happened, and we soon learn that Vincent Price's character is the last survivor of a plague that has turned humanity into a race of vampires ... prowling at night in search of blood and repelled by garlic (an allergic reaction) and mirrors.  The story is based upon Richard Matheson's I Am Legend (which is fast, interesting read), and he co-wrote the screenplay.Is it perfect?  No.  Price's performance is a bit too effeminate to be totally effective as a ""one man against the world"" story.

It stars Vincent Price as Robert Morgan, the lone survivor of a mysterious air born plague that ravaged the world, wiping out all life and leaving behind only Morgan-- who is cursed with some unknown ability to resist the bacteria--behind to deal with the aftermath.  It's not just psychological scars that Morgan is dealing with, but also the hordes of vampires that now scour the earth.  You see, the bacteria don't just kill the host, but turns them into vampires.The vampires are your classic prototypes.  They can't come out in the sun, abhor garlic, crosses, and mirrors, and can only be incapacitated with a good stake through the heart and cremation at the local fire pits where the bodies of the dead are consumed by fire to ensure they don't rise again.The film begins by following Morgan through an average day, an intimate peak into his life.  He wakes, inspects the barricades that protect his home, and drives into the vacant city to collect food, gasoline, and plenty of fresh garlic.  He also meticulously searches the deserted city in pursuit of vampires to stake and burn.  Then as darkness arrives, he settles in for another night of hungry vampires collecting around his home, vampires who call out his name, begging him to open the door.  Morgan responds with alcohol, music, and reminisces of his old life, which often is nothing more than torturous memories of his families demise at the hands of the plague.It's very interesting to follow Morgan on one of these trips.  The lifeless cityscape is somehow enticing, yet very lonely.  The idea of being the only person on earth is pretty heavy, and we see how this burden weighs on Morgan's shoulders.  One wonders why he even bothers to continue this strange existence other than some primordial desire to live.  Morgan is trapped.  One would assume being the only person on earth would open endless avenues of freedom, but reality is, he carries many more chains in this new world than in his past one.  In a way, he is the Sisyphus legend born to life, a man doomed to repeat his days over and over with no end in sight.The film does a fantastic job with the daytime scenes in the city and you can really see the amount of  detailing that went into building the deserted streets and shops.  The image created is one of chaotic abandonment--cars hastily left on roads, shopping carts littered across parking lots.  Even Morgan's home is skillfully assembled and resembles a fallout shelter more than a home, which in reality, it has now become.At the end, Morgan's doomed existence seems to lift one day quite by accident when suddenly he realizes that he may not in fact be the last man on earth, that others may in fact live, but this hope takes a fatal turn when Morgan realizes he is indeed the last on earth.

833532,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0002HODU4,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 4]","The Last Man on Earth (Sidney Salkow/Ubaldo Ragona, 1964)I'd have probably ignored this film for the rest of my natural life. I've heard it reviled, vilified, and otherwise trashed by most every Richard Matheson fan on the planet and score after score of critics who fled, screaming and retching, from theatres upon its release. However, I have a friend who is a very big fan of movies that have that particular train-wreck feel to them that I find so appealing, and every time I mention The Omega Man, he counters with The Last Man on Earth. So  popped it into the player Friday night to see what all the fuss was about.The fuss is about atmosphere. It's certainly not about acting, technical proficiency, consistency, or anything else of that sort. Matheson adapted his own novel, but by the time the movie was finished, disowned the project, insisting that his nom de plume Logan Swanson be put in the credits (Swanson, Matheson was heard to say later, wrote ""some of the worst crap ever""). And, really, it is. Robert Morgan (Vincent Price, basically reprising his House of Usher role from four years previous) is a scientist who has survived a worldwide plague that has turned his friends and neighbors (and the rest of the world, of course) into vampires. (For vampires, they look an awful lot like the zombies of modern horror films; George Romero has, in fact, cited Matheson's novel I Am Legend as one of the main influences for Night of the Living Dead.) Led by Morgan's old friend Ben (Giacomo Rossi-Stuart, who turned up later in the infamous stinker Bloodsucker Leads the Dance), the vampires, presumably for lack of anything better to do, crowd around Morgan's house at night, shunning the mirrors and garlic he leaves on the door, banging the dies of the house with sticks and rocks, entreating Morgan to come out so they can kill him. (One wonders why Morgan didn't move into a high-rise, but one may be influenced by having seen The Omega Man too many times.) We get lots of flashback about how the plague spread, and then Morgan meets another survivor-- female, of course(Franca Bettoia of the Sandokan franchise), so they can repopulate the planet. Or something. Because, after all, this is an Italian horror flick, where nothing can go right.Much has been made of the pseudo-fascist imagery, and there is much to be said for it as a subtext, but where the movie really had a chance to shine is in the opening third, before the flashback starts, when we see Morgan going through his daily routine of cleaning up the streets, shopping, staking some vampires and tossing them into the plague pit (which is still aflame after three years-- which seems like a lapse in film logic, but really works, on an eerie sort of level), replenishing his garlic and gasoline supply, etc. There is an almost limitless potential for atmosphere in these scenes, which is evident because despite Salkow's hurrying through them to get to the picture's real plot (which doesn't actually start until almost an hour into the movie, when Price meets Bettoia), there's atmosphere in spades anyway. This despite the widespread and utterly false belief of directors in black-and-white-film days that you could film in the daytime and have viewers believe it was dark because a car had its headlights on. (There are a number of cuts in a scene where Price is dashing back to his house after dark where portions were obviously shot at, or close to, noon. Beautiful.) This despite the terrible acting by the zombies, and Price's woeful narration, which sounds more like he's already one of the undead than just some guy who happens to be tired of his lot in life.

This movie was interesting and ""modern"" in it's sensibilities right up to the end where it veered sharply into religious allegory that doesn't quite fit.Vincent Price plays a scientist who experiences the coming plague and the downfall of mankind. Except that they won't all stay down: the undead can rise up and wander around looking for things. They can apparently prey on one another but this does not seem to be diminishing their ranks significantly. The totems of a vampire movie are all rather curiously trotted out: the garlic, the mirrors, the wooden stake through the heart. This vampire motif is questioned later when the undead are offed by metal stakes, and even guns. Our hero, Dr Morgan, is momentarily bemused by this observation but the suggested thread that perhaps these undead are not vampires but somehting else, the vampire thing having been suggested by his friend and coworker before the plague, is not pursued.There is a lengthy pre-quel that demonstrates how our hero has been reduced to living. I enjoyed those scenes quite a bit and they were rather creepy and scary. A dog shows up just to depress him, then a woman. It turns out that the woman is infected but keeping herself alive with some sort of injected ""de-fibrinated blood vaccine"". There is, she tells him, a whole burgeoning society of half-cured undead (think:""AIDS"") living in the city, and to them HE is the scary monster that walks by day, killing the undead with stakes! ""Some of them were alive!"" she tells him and the horror and shock of who he is to the others is revealed. It finally occurs to him to give the woman a blood transfusion which saves her (she can stand to see herself in a mirror again...) but she is unable to prevent Dr Morgan's execution at the hands of the angry mob. In a church, no less.So overall, pretty good and creepy but the ending was weak. 4 stars.",4,"Surprisingly good, and effective",1144800000,"04 12, 2006",2006,1971,"['was', 'expecting', 'much', 'worse', 'viewing', 'House', 'Haunted', 'Hill', 'was', 'just', 'silly', 'bad', 'movie', 'was', 'interesting', 'modern', 'sensibilities', 'right', 'up', 'end', 'where', 'veered', 'sharply', 'religious', 'allegory', ""n't"", 'quite', 'fit.Vincent', 'Price', 'scientist', 'who', 'coming', 'plague', 'downfall', 'mankind', 'wo', ""n't"", 'all', 'stay', 'undead', 'can', 'rise', 'up', 'wander', 'around', 'looking', 'things', 'can', 'apparently', 'prey', 'one', 'not', 'seem', 'be', 'diminishing', 'ranks', 'significantly', 'totems', 'vampire', 'movie', 'are', 'rather', 'curiously', 'trotted', 'out', 'garlic', 'mirrors', 'wooden', 'stake', 'heart', 'vampire', 'motif', 'questioned', 'later', 'when', 'undead', 'are', 'offed', 'metal', 'stakes', 'even', 'guns', 'hero', 'Dr', 'Morgan', 'momentarily', 'bemused', 'observation', 'suggested', 'thread', 'perhaps', 'undead', 'are', 'not', 'vampires', 'somehting', 'else', 'vampire', 'thing', 'having', 'been', 'suggested', 'friend', 'coworker', 'plague', 'not', 'pursued.There', 'lengthy', 'pre-quel', 'how', 'hero', 'been', 'reduced', 'living', 'enjoyed', 'scenes', 'quite', 'bit', 'were', 'rather', 'creepy', 'scary', 'dog', 'up', 'just', 'depress', 'then', 'woman', 'out', 'woman', 'infected', 'keeping', 'alive', 'sort', 'injected', 'de-fibrinated', 'blood', 'vaccine', 'whole', 'burgeoning', 'society', 'half-cured', 'undead', 'think', 'AIDS', 'living', 'city', 'HE', 'scary', 'monster', 'walks', 'day', 'killing', 'undead', 'stakes', 'were', 'alive', 'horror', 'shock', 'who', 'others', 'revealed', 'finally', 'give', 'woman', 'blood', 'transfusion', 'can', 'stand', 'see', 'mirror', 'again', 'unable', 'prevent', 'Dr', 'Morgan', 'execution', 'hands', 'angry', 'mob', 'church', 'less.So', 'overall', 'pretty', 'good', 'creepy', 'ending', 'was', 'weak', '4', 'stars']",N/A
