This is a great documentary style film on the ""Music for the Masses"" tour. The film starts with a contest for lucky fans of the group Depeche Mode to win a ride along with the group.

This is far more interesting and entertaining then most documentaries that are released and the great thing is actually feeling like being in the journey.

This is compulsive watching as an on-the-road documentary of the band as they set up for their 101st gig at the Pasadena Rose Bowl.Some may complain that there should have been a live video instead of what was given but I disagree. Live videos are somewhat boring as they don't really give you the feeling that is to be there live. Having said that I suppose it would have been a good memento for anyone that was there at the show. But this is just my opinionHowever I do find my annoyances with it myself and that's mainly because of the sidetrack tale of a bunch of teenagers going to the gig and their teenage philosophies. It tends to be very dull and uninteresting and I don't really want to hear their views on fashion ( oh but Depeche Mode means fast fashion doesn't it ). Nevertheless you get a good quote out of one them who hates Guns'n'Roses who retitles them &quot; Guns'n'Posers.&quot; I'm sure Axl wouldn't want to hear it but then given how he likes Depeche Mode and Pet Shop Boys - I'm sure he takes it as a compliment! Otherwise he would have had the lawyers round!But we know that Dave is &quot; not a f*cking wordsworth &quot; and that Marty began a little obsession with country and western music which goes a long way into explaining why Johnny Cash must have covered Personal Jesus ( although hindsight is a beautiful thing ), Fletch is just there basically to hold them together and Alan reveals that even he cocks up on the keyboards so there's hope for us all.

776072,A3LX5HJUVX8IX7,B0000CEB62,Joey Saylor,"[4, 4]","After reading some other reviews and due to the fact the whole concert was not on this release, I had just about made up my mind not to buy this. After watching my old VHS copy the other night, I changed my mind. I'm glad I did. The bonus disc in this release makes it very worth the money. Pennebaker's interviews with the band were priceless. The changes that each of the members have gone through over the years really made you realize how much time had passed. I can't believe it's been 15 years! Dave has settled down, Martin looks like the average family man and Fletch, well, is still Fletch. Ironically I even enjoyed the interviews with the tour bus kids. I agreed with Martin that at first I didn't really care for them in the film (I hated how I had to fast forward through the tape all the time), now I see some of the value it did add. The bonus concert feature is still heavily edited, but we are treated to 'Somebody' and 'Pleasure Little Treasure' (notice how some girl storms up on stage and races at Dave). If you still find yourself wanting to skip all the escapades, it will come in handy.The only negatives I found were, for one, the picture quality of the movie was somewhat grainy. My VHS copy has a better picture. Also of course, we don't get the show from start to finish, and probably never will. Blows my mind how such important footage could be lost forever. At least we will always have the CD release and like someone else said, we get about 80% of the concert. I would also add I am disappointed Alan didn't take part. I've always admired and respected his work, especially with the band. I think this was a tad petty. At least he should tell people why.At any rate kudos to Chris and D.A. for their hard work in making all this happen.

776073,A3A48XEYWLWH7T,B0000CEB62,John IV,"[15, 15]","My 101'st review is for 101.  It was great seeing the boys again, transported back in time to perhaps the pinnacle of their bourgeoning careers.  Only recently coming to DVD, 101 follows a group of 8 Depeche Mode fans across the country on bus after they won a promotional contest to participate.  Ostensibly the first reality show, pre-dating MTV's insipid Real World series, we got to know a bit about the busmates against the backdrop of various shots of the band's performances as they made their way to their 101'st show at the Rose Bowl, CA in the summer of 1988.  I graduated HS that year and Depeche Mode had been [and is] my favorite band since their Some Great Reward Album.  It was fun nostalgia to be transported back to those days of halcyon youth. &lt;grin>.  The audio commentary from the band was entertaining, more so than the individual interviews on the second disc.  I had a lot of favorites working in this movie, MftM is my favorite DM album, and we are once again reminded of the talent of Alan Wilder.  It's interesting the little snippets that slip in about Alan [who declined to participate in the interviews or commentary], and about how Dave, who laughing states 'Look at Al, he's too cool for school' misses him.  What would the output have been like beyond SoFAD if Alan had stayed.  Ah well, at least out of the departure Recoil matured and bore fruit.  Anyhow this was a feel good viewing, with lizard-like slicked back Fletch once more egging the fans on with his clapping technique. It gets added to the other DM DVDs in my collection, and I can highly recommend it for fans and newbies.",5,Nostalgia for the Masses,1069977600,"11 28, 2003",2003,1621,"[""101'st"", 'review', '101', 'was', 'great', 'seeing', 'boys', 'again', 'transported', 'back', 'time', 'perhaps', 'pinnacle', 'bourgeoning', 'careers', 'Only', 'recently', 'coming', 'DVD', '101', 'group', '8', 'Depeche', 'Mode', 'fans', 'country', 'bus', 'won', 'promotional', 'contest', 'participate', 'Ostensibly', 'first', 'reality', 'show', 'pre-dating', 'MTV', 'insipid', 'Real', 'World', 'series', 'got', 'know', 'bit', 'busmates', 'backdrop', 'various', 'shots', 'band', 'performances', 'made', 'way', ""101'st"", 'show', 'Rose', 'Bowl', 'CA', 'summer', '1988', 'graduated', 'HS', 'year', 'Depeche', 'Mode', 'had', 'been', '[', ']', 'favorite', 'band', 'Great', 'Reward', 'Album', 'was', 'fun', 'nostalgia', 'be', 'transported', 'back', 'days', 'halcyon', 'youth', 'lt', '>', 'audio', 'commentary', 'band', 'was', 'entertaining', 'more', 'so', 'individual', 'interviews', 'second', 'disc', 'had', 'lot', 'favorites', 'working', 'movie', 'MftM', 'favorite', 'DM', 'album', 'are', 'once', 'again', 'reminded', 'talent', 'Alan', 'Wilder', 'interesting', 'little', 'snippets', 'slip', 'Alan', '[', 'who', 'declined', 'participate', 'interviews', 'commentary', ']', 'how', 'Dave', 'who', 'laughing', 'states', ""'Look"", 'Al', 'too', 'cool', 'school', 'misses', 'What', 'would', 'output', 'have', 'been', 'SoFAD', 'Alan', 'had', 'stayed', 'Ah', 'well', 'least', 'departure', 'Recoil', 'matured', 'bore', 'fruit', 'Anyhow', 'was', 'feel', 'good', 'viewing', 'lizard-like', 'slicked', 'back', 'Fletch', 'once', 'more', 'egging', 'fans', 'clapping', 'technique', 'added', 'other', 'DM', 'DVDs', 'collection', 'can', 'highly', 'recommend', 'fans', 'newbies']",N/A
776074,A2YFOLJQNPMQU6,B0000CEB62,Pedro Delgado,"[4, 4]","I consider Depeche Mode's 101 to be one of the greatest concert films of all time, up there with &quot;The Last Waltz&quot; and &quot;Stop Making Sense&quot;.  I owned the original VHS release (as well as the CD), and had been waiting patiently for this to be released on DVD.  I was not dissapointed.  In addition to relieving the experience with a better sound and quality, you also get some great interviews.  This DVD brought back some great memories of lost high school days.Maybe the nostalgia clouts my review, but I do feel that those reviewers giving this DVD a low rating were not around when the film was first release.  I actually get the feeling some feel it is a brand new release.  The reason why this DVD could not be done in a &quot;One Night in Paris&quot; style is that it was released well over a dozen years before that concert!!! Plus, I find 101 so much more interesting.  You get to see not just the concert (regardless of what the young'ems say, Depeche Mode were at the top of their game during the Music for the Masses tour) but also a glimpse into the lives of devoted DM fans, and just your normal everyday backstage stuff that goes on.Normally, one would not expect &quot;electronic&quot; music to be particularly captivating live.  Play the tape, dance around.  However, Depeche Mode inject a vigor into their live performances that differentiates their live performances from their recorded output.
