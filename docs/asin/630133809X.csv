250270,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,630133809X,Andrew Ellington,"[5, 6]","Oliver Stone is a director who has yet to really wow me.  I know that he is loved by many, but the films I've seen of his have been less than satisfying for me.  Granted, I have not seen `Nixon' or `JFK' yet, and I do plan on seeing them soon, but I really was hoping that `Talk Radio' was going to change my mind on the controversial director.It hasn't.The idea and overall concept behind `Talk Radio' is actually quite intelligent.  Taking accounts from the true life murder of radio DJ Alan Berg, the film has an underlying ring of truth to every word, which helps in areas where the film is lacking.  As the final frames ignite the screen one is left pondering some very weighty matters, such as the world's fascination with the obscene.  This is a prominent subject throughout the film, one that Barry Champlain (the fictitious DJ representing Berg) brings up quite a bit, especially as his mental state spirals towards the films end.The film follows Champlain, a former suit tailor who caught a big break and ran with it.  His spicy personality and `no holds bar' attitude have kept him quite popular with the late night listeners, and his show is now being considered for national syndication.  Champlain is insistent that, if this deal goes through, he is not changing his style in anyway to appease the big corporations.Take it or leave it.The film focuses on a particularly bad night.  The callers keep getting more and more obscene and sadistic and this is taking a toll on the already edgy Champlain.  His ex-wife is in the studio for what promises the first night of syndication, but problems off the air cause Champlain's dreams to shatter; and persistent callers keep messing with his nerves.The film has some very strong opinions about society and youth and our attitudes towards one another, and it has the perfect outlet for those opinions, but sadly the film fails to really deliver them as strongly and defiantly as they could have.  There are a few areas that could have been cleaned up.  For starters, the flashback scenes were unnecessary.  They take away from the apparent increase of suspense Stone was trying to permeate the film with.  That suspense never truly kicks in until the last few moments (the walk to the car) and in essence the final brutal scene is dampened by the fact that the balance of the film seems forced.  In fact, the suspense seems so forced that the film comes off rather hokey in areas.  Eric Bogosian is obviously very devoted to this film and this story (he wrote the stage play from which the film is spawned, but his delivery is rather obnoxious and deters the audience from the message of the film.  He comes off bitter and preachy as apposed to genuinely concerned.This is disappointing, because the message here is very poignant today.  We live in a world consumed with gloom and obsessed with misery, and this is the very caution that Champlain is throwing in our face.  If it had been handled better it could have been one of the most socially important films of the 80's, maybe even today.  Instead it is the film that could have been great but has to settle for decent.",3,"It tries very hard, but it fails to really connect...",1222732800,"09 30, 2008",2008,3131,"['Oliver', 'Stone', 'director', 'who', 'yet', 'really', 'wow', 'know', 'loved', 'many', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'have', 'been', 'less', 'satisfying', 'Granted', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'Nixon', 'JFK', 'yet', 'do', 'plan', 'seeing', 'soon', 'really', 'was', 'hoping', 'Talk', 'Radio', 'was', 'going', 'change', 'mind', 'controversial', 'director.It', ""hasn't.The"", 'idea', 'overall', 'concept', 'Talk', 'Radio', 'actually', 'quite', 'intelligent', 'Taking', 'accounts', 'true', 'life', 'murder', 'radio', 'DJ', 'Alan', 'Berg', 'film', 'underlying', 'ring', 'truth', 'word', 'areas', 'where', 'film', 'lacking', 'final', 'frames', 'ignite', 'screen', 'one', 'left', 'pondering', 'very', 'weighty', 'matters', 'such', 'world', 'fascination', 'obscene', 'prominent', 'subject', 'film', 'one', 'Barry', 'Champlain', 'fictitious', 'DJ', 'representing', 'Berg', 'up', 'quite', 'bit', 'especially', 'mental', 'state', 'spirals', 'towards', 'films', 'end.The', 'film', 'Champlain', 'former', 'suit', 'tailor', 'who', 'caught', 'big', 'break', 'ran', 'spicy', 'personality', 'bar', 'attitude', 'have', 'kept', 'quite', 'popular', 'late', 'night', 'listeners', 'show', 'now', 'being', 'considered', 'national', 'syndication', 'Champlain', 'insistent', 'deal', 'not', 'changing', 'style', 'anyway', 'appease', 'big', 'corporations.Take', 'leave', 'it.The', 'film', 'focuses', 'particularly', 'bad', 'night', 'callers', 'keep', 'getting', 'more', 'more', 'obscene', 'sadistic', 'taking', 'toll', 'already', 'edgy', 'Champlain', 'ex-wife', 'studio', 'what', 'first', 'night', 'syndication', 'problems', 'off', 'air', 'cause', 'Champlain', 'dreams', 'shatter', 'persistent', 'callers', 'keep', 'messing', 'nerves.The', 'film', 'very', 'strong', 'opinions', 'society', 'youth', 'attitudes', 'one', 'perfect', 'outlet', 'opinions', 'sadly', 'film', 'really', 'deliver', 'strongly', 'defiantly', 'could', 'have', 'are', 'few', 'areas', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cleaned', 'up', 'starters', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'were', 'unnecessary', 'take', 'away', 'apparent', 'increase', 'suspense', 'Stone', 'was', 'trying', 'permeate', 'film', 'suspense', 'never', 'truly', 'kicks', 'last', 'few', 'moments', 'walk', 'car', 'essence', 'final', 'brutal', 'scene', 'dampened', 'fact', 'balance', 'film', 'forced', 'fact', 'suspense', 'so', 'forced', 'film', 'rather', 'hokey', 'areas', 'Eric', 'Bogosian', 'obviously', 'very', 'devoted', 'film', 'story', 'wrote', 'stage', 'play', 'film', 'spawned', 'delivery', 'rather', 'obnoxious', 'audience', 'message', 'film', 'bitter', 'preachy', 'apposed', 'genuinely', 'concerned.This', 'disappointing', 'message', 'here', 'very', 'poignant', 'today', 'live', 'world', 'consumed', 'gloom', 'obsessed', 'misery', 'very', 'caution', 'Champlain', 'throwing', 'face', 'had', 'been', 'handled', 'better', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'most', 'socially', 'important', 'films', '80', 'maybe', 'even', 'today', 'Instead', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'settle', 'decent']",N/A

Barry Champagne gave me a headache, like Michael Savage used to do.  I called a local talk show taking up two hours on my favorite station and asked them to ""give us our music back.""  Words can injure and kill; they can cause permanent damage.  The unstable callers are dangerous to themselves and to others as this movie showed so eloquently and one had to die for his religious persuation and born as Jewish.  It just took one misfit who had the gall and gun to put this abrasive, insensitive (on and off the air) out of commission.  He looked a lot like Seinfeld.His ex-wife called him a troublemaker, a ""con man"" who wouldn't know how love feels.  He forces callers to confess on the air to crimes.  He gets everyone all riled up but insists that his boss be his ""buddy.""  Radio people are never as you imagine they would.  At first, it's always disappointing and a bit of a shock; the beautiful voice never matches the face or personality.  That's why they are on radio and not t.v., funny or not.  He and his listeners are in love with his voice and think he is kind.  Wrong.  He declared that there is nothing more boring than people who love you and tends to live in a dream world.Like so many people, educated and ignorant, they believe what they read in the newspaper.

I can testify first hand, that the actor in Talk Radio had Alan Burke down to a tee.I enjoy character driven movies more than action driven movies and it is always interesting when well written dialogue and first rate action can keep you glued to your seat. Incidently, poorly written dialogue along with over the top, overdone action scenes are the usual hallmarks of Stone's films and that makes Talk Radio a rare exception. I would love to say that I hate Oliver Stone's movies, but this particular release, along with Wall Street prevents me from saying that with 100 percent truthfulness.Being a local radio talk show host myself, I have enjoyed the very few movies about radio hosts (Good Morning Vietnam and Play Misty For Me also come to mind. Of course in ""Misty"" Clint Eastwood's occupation is only background for a much different story, so this Oliver Stone vehicle and Good Morning Vietnam are the only two major movies on this subject that I know of.)With the popularity of talk radio that has occurred in our country this last decade and a half, I am surprised that the film, Talk Radio is not more popular on DVD.

250275,A3TCTFGX48CYWB,630133809X,David O'Brien,"[23, 26]","Often overlooked ,'Talk Radio' is one of Oliver Stone's most enduring pieces of work. It's based on a radio play written by Eric Bogosian who is the main character in this, the film version .Bogosian delivers a powerful performance as the tortured, acerbic DJ shock-jock Barry Champlain.Bogosian's play itself is based on the death of Denver DJ Alan Berg who was shot dead in 1984 by a White Power/Aryan group known as The Order.Bogosian delivers a brilliant performance as Champlain - a former tailor's assistant in Dallas who is discovered by a local DJ and after audition, becomes a late-night DJ on a radio station.The basic storyline is that Champlain does a nighttime show called 'Nighttalk' where he gets to talk live to various sick and twisted individuals who ring up. The characters who inhabit Champlain's life are Laura - his lover and assistant, Stew - his producer and similarly-sarcastic wit played by Stone favourite John C.McGinley and Dan the hard-nosed boss played by the brooding Alec Baldwin.Baldwin is trying to get a national syndication deal for Bogosian and the Nighttalk show and a rep of Metrowave ,the company interested in the syndication is in the studio checking out Champlain's show. Champlain has had a bad night with lots of weird people ringing his show.In the midst of all of this, Champlain's estranged wife Ellen (played by Ellen Greene) is coming to Dallas for a few days.It's not made clear why she is coming but it seems that he is under pressure and needs someone in his life who truly understands him - like Ellen does.The film is much more than a meditation on the sickness of society - the people who ring up the radio show host to taunt and be taunted by Champlain , but is about Champlain's loss of esteem and spirit in the wake of infidelity on his wife Ellen and years of abusing his guests.When Ellen comes to Dallas , she realises that she wants him back but he has been so poisoned by the world that he inhabits that he rebukes her attempt at reconciliation.The film plays over the course of one dark night of the soul when Champlain receives a mystery package at the station which turns out to be a bomb hoax, has to deal with a high studio 'guest' called Chet who he invites down to the studio, and finally a nervous breakdown in the studio as he finally snaps.The end of the film is not for the faint of heart. I don't want to spoil it but I think you can figure out that there are no happy endings.Overall, 'Talk Radio' is a sombre and serious piece brilliantly acted all around. The script is co-written by Bogosian and Oliver Stone and is intelligent and vibrant.I can thoroughly recommend this film to all lovers of serious, character-driven movies.It's one of my all-time favourites",5,Intense and brooding meditation on life,1131667200,"11 11, 2005",2005,2742,"['Often', 'overlooked', 'Radio', 'one', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'most', 'enduring', 'pieces', 'work', 'based', 'radio', 'play', 'written', 'Eric', 'Bogosian', 'who', 'main', 'character', 'film', 'version', '.Bogosian', 'powerful', 'performance', 'tortured', 'acerbic', 'DJ', 'shock-jock', 'Barry', 'Champlain.Bogosian', 'play', 'based', 'death', 'Denver', 'DJ', 'Alan', 'Berg', 'who', 'was', 'shot', 'dead', '1984', 'White', 'Power/Aryan', 'group', 'known', 'Order.Bogosian', 'delivers', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'Champlain', 'former', 'tailor', 'assistant', 'Dallas', 'who', 'discovered', 'local', 'DJ', 'audition', 'late-night', 'DJ', 'radio', 'station.The', 'basic', 'storyline', 'Champlain', 'nighttime', 'show', 'called', ""'Nighttalk"", 'where', 'talk', 'live', 'various', 'sick', 'twisted', 'individuals', 'who', 'ring', 'up', 'characters', 'who', 'inhabit', 'Champlain', 'life', 'are', 'Laura', 'lover', 'assistant', 'Stew', 'producer', 'similarly-sarcastic', 'wit', 'played', 'Stone', 'favourite', 'John', 'C.McGinley', 'Dan', 'hard-nosed', 'boss', 'played', 'brooding', 'Alec', 'Baldwin.Baldwin', 'trying', 'get', 'national', 'syndication', 'deal', 'Bogosian', 'Nighttalk', 'show', 'rep', 'Metrowave', 'company', 'interested', 'syndication', 'studio', 'checking', 'out', 'Champlain', 'show', 'Champlain', 'had', 'bad', 'night', 'lots', 'weird', 'people', 'ringing', 'show.In', 'midst', 'Champlain', 'estranged', 'wife', 'Ellen', 'played', 'Ellen', 'Greene', 'coming', 'Dallas', 'few', 'days.It', 'not', 'made', 'clear', 'why', 'coming', 'pressure', 'someone', 'life', 'who', 'truly', 'Ellen', 'does.The', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'meditation', 'sickness', 'society', 'people', 'who', 'ring', 'up', 'radio', 'show', 'host', 'taunt', 'be', 'taunted', 'Champlain', 'Champlain', 'loss', 'esteem', 'spirit', 'wake', 'infidelity', 'wife', 'Ellen', 'years', 'abusing', 'guests.When', 'Ellen', 'Dallas', 'back', 'been', 'so', 'poisoned', 'world', 'attempt', 'reconciliation.The', 'film', 'course', 'one', 'dark', 'night', 'soul', 'when', 'Champlain', 'mystery', 'package', 'station', 'out', 'be', 'bomb', 'hoax', 'deal', 'high', 'studio', ""'guest"", 'called', 'Chet', 'who', 'down', 'studio', 'finally', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'studio', 'finally', 'snaps.The', 'end', 'film', 'not', 'faint', 'heart', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'think', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'are', 'happy', 'endings.Overall', 'Radio', 'sombre', 'serious', 'piece', 'brilliantly', 'acted', 'around', 'script', 'co-written', 'Bogosian', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'intelligent', 'vibrant.I', 'can', 'thoroughly', 'recommend', 'film', 'lovers', 'serious', 'character-driven', 'movies.It', 'one', 'all-time', 'favourites']",N/A

Whether it's too ugly or too real for them they would rather disagree or dissociate themselves from it completely to avoid shame or just not to have to agree they're wrong. But thats all good...everyone as the right to have an opinion...but there's another kind of people who will make sure you pay for not agreeing with them...some of them will actually go to the extreme and attack you in every possible way....  This movie is just a perfect example. It tells the real story of the assassination of radio host Alan berg and is unique confrontational interview style.Way too many people thinks that Oliver Stone likes to ""alter"" the facts and sometimes relates to things that actually never happened in real life. Stone always  was a dramatical film maker, the movies  he makes are HIS vision of what happened and how, they are NOT documentaries!!. He makes movies about real people that were once famous for a reason or another and how they struggle as human beings with the realities of life: love, relationship, pressure, fame, drug abuse and money. This is why you can clearly see in his filmography that his movies are one thing... and his documentaries are another..The story of Alan berg (Barry Champlain in the movie) is very impressive. He was a radio host who wasn't afraid to say what was on his mind and what he believed in, sometimes shocking and humiliating callers to the extreme. No topics were taboo and callers were able to say whatever they wanted to. This was a very rock and roll show to say the least.....Eric Bogosian's performance as Barry Champlain is just outstanding!! He does it so well you could believe thats really what he does for living; arguing with people over the phone!! Unfortunately one day, he pushes one of his caller a little too far and will have to deal with the consequences.The cinematography is good, i think it reflects the 80's very well and what was brand new at the time in terms of picture quality should not bother you at all today in 2012. If your ready for another dose of ""Stone Reality"" you can give this one a try, it should not disappoint. Definitely another classic by oliver Stone but remember....it is not a documentary....its the dramatisation of  real  events surrounding the death of Alan Berg.

250277,A3L31489BCB1D7,630133809X,El Kabong,"[11, 30]","Oliver Stone, Eric Bogosian: two self-important, index-finger-jabbing blowhards who were fated to collaborate. Back in the 80s, both of them were fast-rising up and comers, much lauded by the leading lights of the hipoisie. Time has not been kind to either man's resume, and it's barely more than a decade later: imagine how phony TALK RADIO will look to the Stem Cell Clone Generation in another ten years. The drama on view is essentially a Grand Guignol updating of the old Rod Serling/Paddy Chayefsky PLAYHOUSE 90 model, tarted up with layers of exploitation, confrontation and narcissism. Though the events the movie is based on are true, every second of this loose re-enactment plays false. I don't know what we're supposed to make of Barry Champlaign, the anti-hero of this piece: the way Bogosian plays him, you can't believe this man would make a career in radio to begin with. Bogosian's an interesting-looking actor with a soulful, hyperintelligent quality, but I've yet to seen him in a role where he's not Eric Bogosian playing himself: it's as if he thinks himself out of an actual performance. Here, he's so ludicrously pent up with a viper's nest of cross-loathings - for his job, his listeners, his coworkers and himself - you can't feel any real empathy for him, and you don't much care when he's eventually murdered. The laboriously heavy hand of Stone is evident as well in the callers to Bogosian's talk-show. Every one of 'em come off as the standard liberal nightmare vision of that regrettable stretch of parking-lot representing America between the coasts: relentlessly unintelligent, stunted emotional cripples with four teeth in their heads and Confederate-flag decals on their pickups. The message being sent - one we've heard and HEARD by now - is that these people, boobs at best and evil incarnate at worst, have guns and must be stopped. Never mind that every degrading 'caller' is simply an actor reading a script designed to make them sound like warped, gone-astray versions of the 'little people' so obnoxiously patronized by the likes of Chayefsky and Serling a generation earlier - Eric and Oliver would never slant the material to make the boobs look worse, and the soul-searching Barry Champlaign more Christ-like in his torments as he dies for our beer-drinking, football-watching sins....would they? The new cliche about things like TALK RADIO is that they're only reflections of society, not a writer's invention, transcribed by Artists shotgun-married to the Truth, no matter how painful it may be to people who, by convenient accident, already find said Artists puerile and propagandistic. It's a convenient cop-out redolent of the kind of bet-hedging unique to the boho crowd: if you love it, I'm the genius responsible; if you hate it, don't look at me, it's YOUR world - I'm only describing what I see. And the funniest touch in the movie is Champlaign's fending off the pressure of the 'suits' to tone his act down, lest he blow his shot at going national. Tone it down, huh? We live in an culture now dominated by Howard Stern, the WWF, 'Jackass' and 'The X Show', and these guys want me to believe that excessive pandering by a media figure HURTS his career opportunities?",1,Harsh Static,998697600,"08 25, 2001",2001,3222,"['Oliver', 'Stone', 'Eric', 'Bogosian', 'two', 'self-important', 'index-finger-jabbing', 'blowhards', 'who', 'were', 'fated', 'collaborate', 'Back', '80s', 'were', 'fast-rising', 'up', 'comers', 'much', 'lauded', 'leading', 'lights', 'hipoisie', 'Time', 'not', 'been', 'kind', 'man', 'resume', 'barely', 'more', 'decade', 'later', 'imagine', 'how', 'phony', 'TALK', 'RADIO', 'will', 'look', 'Stem', 'Cell', 'Clone', 'Generation', 'ten', 'years', 'drama', 'view', 'essentially', 'Grand', 'Guignol', 'updating', 'old', 'Rod', 'Serling/Paddy', 'Chayefsky', 'PLAYHOUSE', '90', 'model', 'tarted', 'up', 'layers', 'exploitation', 'confrontation', 'narcissism', 'events', 'movie', 'based', 'are', 'true', 'second', 'loose', 're-enactment', 'plays', 'false', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'make', 'Barry', 'Champlaign', 'anti-hero', 'piece', 'way', 'Bogosian', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'man', 'would', 'make', 'career', 'radio', 'begin', 'Bogosian', 'interesting-looking', 'actor', 'soulful', 'hyperintelligent', 'quality', ""'ve"", 'yet', 'seen', 'role', 'where', 'not', 'Eric', 'Bogosian', 'playing', 'actual', 'performance', 'Here', 'so', 'ludicrously', 'pent', 'up', 'viper', 'nest', 'cross-loathings', 'job', 'listeners', 'coworkers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'feel', 'real', 'empathy', 'do', ""n't"", 'much', 'care', 'when', 'eventually', 'murdered', 'laboriously', 'heavy', 'hand', 'Stone', 'evident', 'as', 'well', 'callers', 'Bogosian', 'talk-show', 'one', 'come', 'off', 'standard', 'liberal', 'nightmare', 'vision', 'regrettable', 'stretch', 'parking-lot', 'representing', 'America', 'coasts', 'relentlessly', 'unintelligent', 'stunted', 'emotional', 'cripples', 'four', 'teeth', 'heads', 'Confederate-flag', 'decals', 'pickups', 'message', 'being', 'sent', 'one', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'HEARD', 'now', 'people', 'boobs', 'best', 'evil', 'incarnate', 'worst', 'have', 'guns', 'must', 'be', 'stopped', 'Never', 'mind', 'degrading', ""'caller"", 'simply', 'actor', 'reading', 'script', 'designed', 'make', 'sound', 'warped', 'gone-astray', 'versions', ""'little"", 'people', 'so', 'obnoxiously', 'patronized', 'likes', 'Chayefsky', 'Serling', 'generation', 'earlier', 'Eric', 'Oliver', 'would', 'never', 'slant', 'material', 'make', 'boobs', 'look', 'worse', 'soul-searching', 'Barry', 'Champlaign', 'more', 'Christ-like', 'torments', 'beer-drinking', 'football-watching', 'sins', 'new', 'cliche', 'things', 'TALK', 'RADIO', ""'re"", 'only', 'reflections', 'society', 'not', 'writer', 'invention', 'transcribed', 'Artists', 'shotgun-married', 'Truth', 'matter', 'how', 'painful', 'may', 'be', 'people', 'who', 'convenient', 'accident', 'already', 'find', 'said', 'Artists', 'puerile', 'propagandistic', 'convenient', 'cop-out', 'redolent', 'kind', 'bet-hedging', 'unique', 'boho', 'crowd', 'love', ""'m"", 'genius', 'responsible', 'hate', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'YOUR', 'world', ""'m"", 'only', 'describing', 'what', 'see', 'funniest', 'touch', 'movie', 'Champlaign', 'fending', 'off', 'pressure', ""'suits"", 'tone', 'act', 'down', 'blow', 'shot', 'going', 'national', 'Tone', 'down', 'huh', 'live', 'culture', 'now', 'dominated', 'Howard', 'Stern', 'WWF', ""'Jackass"", 'X', 'Show', 'guys', 'want', 'believe', 'excessive', 'pandering', 'media', 'figure', 'career', 'opportunities']",N/A

No, it's not vertiginous dangling from cliffs or windows; nearly the whole film takes place in a radio sound studio, with the central character seated at a desk. No, there aren't any zombies, ax wielders, vampire, bug-eyed space invaders, or syndicate hit men. All that kind of scary stuff I can easily process as unreal, mere cinema illusion ... [except those dangling-from-windows scenes; they give me goosebumps.] ... but the scary things in this film are the emotions, the hatred and anger seething in the words of the unseen callers to Talk Radio. The violence they threaten against provocative shock jock Barry Champlain, acted by playwright Eric Bogosian, is horrifyingly real. The racism, anti-semitism, homophobia and sado-masochistic perversion the callers spew is verbatim what you can find in written words on comment threads here on amazon. Nothing is said in this film -- not the most nauseating rant -- that isn't said aloud with conviction by thousands of Americans and held in the hearts of millions more. And that's scary!A distant friend suggested that I watch this film, originally released in 1988, this week, in response to the shooting of Congresswoman Giffords in Tucson Arizona, the moderate Democrat who had been 'cross-haired' for elimination by Sarah Palin and who had already been violently targeted by rightist extremists more than once. Yes, this film is powerfully relevant to the toxic politics of the USA today, as well as being a powerful drama in itself, one of director Oliver Stone's most subtle classics. The script, on which Stone and Bogosian collaborated, was based on Bogosian's original stage play, and that play was in turn based partly on the real-world assassination of talk radio host Alan Berg by white supremacists in 1984.Bogosian's character, Barry Champlain, is an abrasive, narcissistic bully. He treats the two women in his life, as seen in the film, vilely. He needs to insult and defy his callers as desperately as they need to vilify him. He's a magnet for hate and self-hate, a kind of 'preacher' without solace to offer. Unlike the run of talk show ranting heads today, he presents himself as a liberal, a punching bag for his callers who has the ultimate power over them of simply hanging up, silencing their tirades. ""They"" hate him so viscerally that his show is immensely popular in Dallas, where it's produced. Tonight, however, Barry learns that his show is likely to be syndicated nationally; a corporate big shot, a guy with a hundred-dollar haircut and and thousand-dollar suit, is in the studio, evaluating Barry purely as marketable entertainment. Whether it's that looming presence, or the shocking ugliness exposed by the particular callers of the evening, Barry is pushed over the edge of self-recognition. He's made a martyr of himself, he realizes, a commercial Christ-figure taking on himself the Sins of the World. He suffers, and his suffering is his own solace for himself.Bogosian plays the role to the hilt; it's no surprise to learn that he wrote the script and wouldn't surprise anyone if it turned out that the role is a self-revelation. Where is Bogosian now? I'll have to check that next.Meanwhile, what can be done about ""talk radio""??? It can't be and shouldn't be censored, yet it is a cancer on American society. It's unrealistic to think that egomaniacal media demagogues like Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck will develop a sense of responsibility; they NEED the adrenalin of rage as hopelessly as fictional Barry Champlain needed it.

250285,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,630133809X,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[8, 10]","""Talk Radio"" seems to be one of Oliver Stone's lesser known works--I keep thinking it's going to come out in a better DVD format and more people will discover what a great, intense and challenging movie that it is.  However, that has yet to happen--and we're left with an unimpressive DVD of a masterful work.  More intimate, more claustrophobic, and more verbal than most of Stone's visually assaultive works, ""Talk Radio"" explores the power of words.  Largely set within the confines of a radio studio during a nightly broadcast--""Talk Radio"" relies on provocative ideas and intelligent performances.  With this seeming lack of physical action, however, is a grandly entertaining and exciting picture.At the center of ""Talk Radio"" is shock jockey Barry Champlain, played by Eric Bogosian.  The story, based loosely on the real life murder of Alan Berg, was adapted from a play created by, written by, and starring Bogosian.  On air nightly, Barry is free to provoke, insult and anger his listeners.  His abrasive, obnoxious persona connects with many of his disaffected, vulnerable overnight audience--but offends in equal measure.  The screenplay, consisting largely of haranguing diatribes, is spot on to the nuances of real radio interplay.  And however you may feel about Barry, it's clear that he's a talented and intelligent button-pusher.Since much of the picture rests on the power of monologue, Bogosian is front and center throughout.  In what I feel is one of the great overlooked performances of the eighties, he is absolutely riveting.  Magnetic and loathsome, intelligent and crude, self-righteous and manipulative--this is powerhouse acting.  I know some may find such unpleasantness bothersome, but it's a fascinating look at a man emotionally trapped within a character he has created.  And those that circle around Barry, either professionally or personally, also pay the price.  Solid work from Ellen Greene, Alec Baldwin, and John C. McGinley help keep the action rolling--and open the work up from it's ""one man show"" origins.Bogosian should have received much more acclaim for his writing and performance, they are unforgettable.

Much like Howard Stern (and it's no coincidence that Champlaign has Stern's same hairdo in flashback scenes), he's a controversial figure who fields phone-calls from the bigoted, insipid white trash that infest the land around him, and occasionally receives threats in the mail.  &quot;Talk Radio&quot; is like Bogosian's &quot;SubUrbia,&quot; in that the action is set in one specific place, and the plot is virtually non-existent.  But the characters are so well-defined and the dialogue so tightly-written that the movie actually speeds along quickly, with Champlaign's blunt barbs keeping you on the edge of your seat (a monologue near the end has Champlaign looking at his microphone as if it's his worst enemy).  We witness his growing tension as the threats pile up around him, his ex-wife walks out of his life, and a national syndication deal goes awry; his only coping mechanism is transforming the frustration into the icy advice and conversation his callers are looking for.&quot;Talk Radio&quot; is essential viewing for fans of Bogosian or Oliver Stone.

The radio staion scenes are filmed with the camera in almost constant motion, almost as if the camera is simulating the eye movements of one who is paranoid and whose guard is constantly up. Certainly Oliver Stones creates the urgency that there is always something/somone lurking in the corner. Talk show host Barry Champlain never feels security, not even in his radio studio, which is constantly infiltrated both by angry callers and vicious hate mail/death threats. For Barry, there is no safe haven.I read ""Talked to Death,"" the biography of Alan Berg (the radio host whom this film is loosely based), and I must say from what I've read the Barry Champlain character is VERY loosely based, and so overdramatized that I had a fair bit of trouble figuring out where Alan Berg comes into this movie at all, other than the fact that he was a radio host who was shot dead. I would go so far as to say this film is entirely a work of fiction, with only slight parallels to Berg.But who cares? It's such a gripping film that it's worth exploring the dark and lonely life of this fictional character. I worked in radio myself for many years, and so obviously I know many people who also work in radio. And many of these people credit this film as the reason why they chose radio as a career. Since this movie is such an unflattering portrayal of the industry, that should give you an idea of how gripping the film was.

Oliver Stone brings this to us in  hardcore movie fashion where on air lights are bright and groupie visitors  are suspicious. This film identifies the pain behind the genius of the talk  radio host by letting you into his out of control life.

Most of all he is troubled,  angry and can only be compared to the tv host of the 70s movie  &quot;Network&quot; with Faye Dunaway. Bogosian is obsessed with the worlds  faults and gives his listeners some awful tasting medicine. The actors who  play the callers are interesting to say the least, as they sound so real at  times expressing their discord and hurt feelings. The radio talk  show type  here is not trying to be funny but trying to change the world. Maybe you've  heard them before.
