After reading some reviews here I find that people either love or hate this movie. I love it because it's part of my childhood. My brother and I saw it in the mid-seventies when I was around 6 and the songs stuck with us for life. He told me he often sings ""So You Wanna Be a Boxer"" while working and no one ever gets the reference. It is obscure but shouldn't be. Aside from the two big stars that would come out of it the movie is amazingly well done for it's time. The sets, dance routines, props (how about those pedal powered limos!), costumes and unforgettable music suggest that the producers really put their hearts into it. Yes, they plagerize mobster films to the tee but that's the point- a true children's world: Instead of brains splattering on a wall when someone is shot in the face they are litterally ""creamed"" with custard; steamy sex is replaced by sweet pecks and hugs, and the ""big shoot out"" that left a bloody mess in ""Scarface"" is replaced here with a food fight, singing, dancing and brotherhood. Wouldn't it be cool if the world were really like that? Maybe not to some, but to those who can see things with children's eyes it might.Yeah, some adults may find some of this creepy, particularly the girls dancing around like Jon Benet Ramsey in short shorts, but remember this movie was made in 1976 before Ramsey, before the ""tweens"" ware a market or even a word, before the Britney and Lohan melt-downs, before reality only existed on TV, before children's cartoons needed parental guidance, before having to keep up with the Kardashians, before everyone felt you really didn't mind hearing their cell phone conversation, before personal computers, before paparazzi killed Diana, before the terrorists slammed into the twin towers, before Bush declared war on the world and mission accomplished and before $4/gallon gas.

You look at some of the names and wonder who the heck they are.  First off you know who Scott Baio is, you know who Jodie Foster is, but who in the world is FLORRIE DUGGER, JOHN CASSI?  When I first saw this movie it was an amazing sight to see that the singing numbers were ""lip-sync'd"".  You'd think that Scott Baio at that age could've actually sang or Jodie Foster actually singing ""My Name is Talula"" or the janitor singing ""Tomorrow"".  The one number I thought was interesting was the ""Fat Sam Speakeasy"" dance number where the teenage black kid WITH PAUL WILLIAMS voice on it.  In case you did not know, Paul Williams musical talents played a big part in all this.  And you know right away when that black teenage boy starts singing, that it is NOT his real voice it is Paul Williams voice.  The funny parts you'll see are the parts where they have the Splurge guns that shoot thawed out biscuits courtesy of NABISCO.  Yes the National Biscuit Company AKA Nabisco furnishes the thawed out biscuits that they shot at each other and the pie fight scene at the end.

Jodi Foster and Scott Baio are odd, funny and interesting to watch and the kid who camps it up as the Fat Sam is brilliant.

I love the music, I love the lines, and I love most of the characters - basically, the whole film!

I admit that  it could be seen as a bit perverted seeing little girls dressed up as  speakeasy dancers, but the whole point is that it's a scaled-down version  of a gangster movie - you can't have adults shooting each other with  custard, it wouldn't work.

223508,A2SGZESU2OPFFM,6300216888,Tom Reagan,"[0, 0]","Just a quick review about the iTV Studios Blu-ray...As another reviewer mentioned, the movie and commentary play fine, with a 5.1 soundtrack that sounds great and the picture quality is great as well, but none of the Extras will play at all, due to the UK format.  I don't think it's PAL though, but maybe 50i?  I'm not an audiophile, so I'm not sure of the format.But if you want this film on blu-ray, it's worth $16, IMO, until Paramount finally releases it in the u.s.  But even then, I would seriously doubt that these extras would be included.  Just a hunch.As for the movie itself, it's really a film for those who grew up with it, like me. In fact, it's the first film I ever remember seeing in the theater (I was 4 years old :-).  Because truthfully, I'm not sure this film holds up for anyone seeing it for the first time, now.  For example, a friend of mine saw it (even several years ago) just laughed after it was over and called it &#34;corny as hell&#34;.  And the acting isn't really great from all parties - specifically the actress who plays Blousey Brown.  Terrible performance.  In fact, if I'm totally honest, she basically ruins every scene she's in.  However the other main actors are good enough, especially young Jodie Foster of course.Overall, though, I love it.  I love the splurge guns.  I love the fact that it's an all kids cast acting as gangster adults.  I love just about every song from the uber-talented Paul Williams, especially &#34;Bad Guys&#34;, &#34;Fat Sam's Grand Slam&#34;, &#34;So You Wanna Be a Boxer&#34;, &#34;Down and Out&#34; and the finale &#34;You Give a Little Love&#34;.
