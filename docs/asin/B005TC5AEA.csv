1503135,AAZRWLML88IZK,B005TC5AEA,A kids review,"[3, 6]","An impassioned performance from Rachel Weisz helps to elevate The Whistleblower above standard issue movie trappings. Based upon actual events, it's the tale of Kathryn Bolkovac, a Nebraska policewoman working as an aid worker in Bosnia when she uncovers a brutal human trafficking ring. However, her efforts to report her discoveries are stymied by some of her fellow UN Peacekeepers, and Bolkovac wages a dangerous one-woman campaign to bring the truth to light. Though I found The Whistleblower to be a bit too heavy-handed, the film is a solid throwback to the paranoid political thrillers of the 1970s, as well as a decent primer on an undeniably important issue.",3,The Whistleblower,1328054400,"02 1, 2012",2012,668,"['impassioned', 'performance', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'elevate', 'Whistleblower', 'standard', 'issue', 'movie', 'trappings', 'Based', 'actual', 'events', 'tale', 'Kathryn', 'Bolkovac', 'Nebraska', 'policewoman', 'working', 'aid', 'worker', 'Bosnia', 'when', 'brutal', 'human', 'trafficking', 'ring', 'However', 'efforts', 'report', 'discoveries', 'are', 'stymied', 'fellow', 'UN', 'Peacekeepers', 'Bolkovac', 'dangerous', 'one-woman', 'campaign', 'bring', 'truth', 'light', 'found', 'Whistleblower', 'be', 'bit', 'too', 'heavy-handed', 'film', 'solid', 'throwback', 'paranoid', 'political', 'thrillers', '1970s', 'as', 'well', 'decent', 'primer', 'undeniably', 'important', 'issue']","The Whistleblower [2010, Canada] DVD Starring Rachel Weisz & Monica Bellucci"

It delivers a strong message of just how much gender roles have changed in many countries, and how far they have yet to come still, in others.The story follows a cop by the name Kathryn Bolkovac, that trades the standard ""protect and serve"" duties, for a more unconventional job with a security agency abroad. While in Bosnia (the setting for most of the movie), she finds that women are trafficked as sexual properties, and the parties responsible for this enjoy the protections of crooked politicians. Kathryn Bolkovac (as portrayed by Rachel Weisz) takes a stand for these women, while trying to overcome the absurdly fiendish ringleaders that are in charge of the operation.The way this character raises her voice for the silent and oppressed, should bring tears to the eyes of even the strongest willed women.

She is originally scheduled for a six month term, but due to an early triumph successfully prosecuting a domestic violence case, she is asked to stay longer in the position of Head of Gender Affairs.  As such, she begins investigating a  human trafficking and prostitution ring.  The eerie part being that the clientele and operators of the ring are not necessarily the local Serbs and Croats, but some of the U.N. Diplomats and ""Peacekeepers"" as well.  With such high ups being involved, some of the U.N. officials try to stymie her investigation.  And she even gets fired.  It turns out the Democra company is based out of England and with some support she's able to collect evidence substantial enough to expose the atrocities to the BBC and file a whistleblower lawsuit.  The movie does an excellent job of bringing out the horrors of the sex trafficking trade and it shows how the impressionable young girls are often hoodwinked into the scheme by their own relatives.

1503155,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,B005TC5AEA,Dr. James Gardner,"[2, 2]","""The Whistleblower"" is a 2010 film that tells the story of Kathryn Bolkovac, a police woman from Nebraska who worked as a part of the 2100 member UN International Police Force in Bosnia in the 1990s. In 2001 Bolkovac was fired for reporting her fellow officers for their involvement in sex crimes and prostitution rackets, and she subsequently sued for wrongful termination and won. She co-authored a book about her experiences, and that book is the basis of this film.The film stars Rachel Weisz as Bolkovac with Vanessa Redgrave and David Strathairn as her allies.Weisz (1970) is the British born actress who won an Oscar for ""The Constant Gardener"" (2005) but is probably better known for her ""Mummy"" films with Brendan Fraser. She does a fine job in projecting her vulnerability beneath the determination to do the right thing.Vanessa Redgrave (1937) puts in her usual good performance. Redgrave was nominated for an Oscar 6 times and won for ""Julia"" (1977). In addition she has 5 Emmy nominations and 2 wins.David Strathairn (1949) puts in another convincing performance. He was nominated for an Oscar, Golden Globe, and BAFTA for his phenomenal performance as Edward R Murrow in ""Good Night and Good Luck"" (2005).First time director Larysa Kondracki spent two years in Europe research sex trafficking in Eastern Europe along with the film's co-writer Ellis Kirwan. Unfortunately the film's pacing is not up to its acting, although she does manage to build suspense in several scenes.The film won several film festival awards.

Kathryn Bolkovak (Rachel Weisz) is an Arkansas cop who just lost custody of her daughter to her ex. She can't seem to get into higher paying cop work until she hears of a high paying position with the peace keeping forces in Bosnia. She signs on and gets a whiff of human sex trafficking that might involve peace keepers and those way high up in the chain. She starts to investigate and the doo-doo hits the fan.I liked this a lot. Weisz's character is very human. She's driven in her job (so much so she's blown two marriages) but truly loves her daughter which is why she takes the gig. But she's not a hard case. She needs affection and sex as much as the next girl. The thought of human trafficking is a punch in the guts to her and she, naively, goes after it not even imagining where this could lead. Of course the guys in charge of the girls are total slimeballs. I wanted to dispense with the investigation and just put bullets in their heads. This is so remote from what the average American experiences in their life that it's hard to imagine people being so callous. The investigation has its fits and starts. She makes headway but the deck is stacked against her. The still lovely Vanessa Redgrave is on hand to lend help and a sympathetic ear. David Strathairn plays a key role as well. He's good but his part is rather small as is Monica Bellucci's. She barely exists here. There is a clever sleight of hand in the climax. It might be cheap but I liked it.This is a story that needs to be told. The statistics at the end are staggering and one hopes this moving up the priority list.

Sweet,"[0, 3]","Alas, I would have been happier with a more action filled version of American lady cop Rachel Weisz tracking down East European  sex traffickers in Bosnia. The character played by Weisz was, alas, one dimensional (that's not her fault ... it's in the screen play).  The movie of an analogous genre, ""In the Land of Blood and Honey"" directed and starring Angelina Jolie set the bar very high ... but because it was in both Bosnian and English, with English subtitles who besides me had seen it?Improbably, the Weisz lady cop roams about the countryside surrounding post-war Sarajevo some times alone, and not speaking a word of the local language. Local thugs and killers (not to mention members of a corrupt police force) exploit, torture, and even murder young women sex slaves ... most often ""imported"" from the Ukraine and Russia. Soon enough, Weisz's character is hot on their trail .... and they know it. How can she be so lucky as to not have one of the thugs make her disappear or put a bomb under her jeep ... that she often races around the countryside in with apparent impunity. Weisz's confidante and ally played by David Strathairn, in a sense had a more realistic role as a United Nations bureaucrat trying to help Weisz expose the horror and corruption reaching to the highest levels in the occupying forces and local police.I don't fault the actors, among my favorites, for how the story unfolds.

1503164,AZAEJB1ECT9HC,B005TC5AEA,Gary P. Cohen,"[2, 5]","I've been a fan of Rachel Weicz since The Mummy films so when I saw the cover of the blu-ray box I decided to check it out.  I only vaguely remembered this film playing in theaters so I had little to go on.  The cover features Rachel in the leather jacket she wears throughout most of the film and she is holding what appears to be a pistol.  However if you are expecting Rachel as Dirty Harriet, you will be sadly disappointed.  I don't think there is one scene in the film where she is actually  holding the gun on the cover.  As a matter of fact, the film really has no action at all.Rachel stars as Karen Bolkovic, a Nebraska police officer with money problems.  So she becomes part of a UN sponsored international police force stationed in Bosnia.  It is there that she discovers the sad fact of white slavery and human trafficking in girls for prostitution.  Furthermore she learns that the UN powers-that-be are well-aware of it and some of her fellow policemen are actually involved and profiting from it themselves.  The girls trapped in this horrible life are raped constantly and the film does not shy away from some difficult scenes.  The suspense in the film builds gradually until she is fired from her job and must obtain and smuggle out files indicating her superiors' knowledge of what has been going on.  The film comes to an abrupt but positive conclusion.Weicz is great as usual (and looks good no matter what role she is playing.) Vanessa Redgrave plays a UN official sympathetic to Rachel's plight.  (At one point in the film, she states the UN was created to prevent another Auschwitz.  I thought this was amusing coming from the actress who blasted the ""Zionist Hoodlums"" at the Academy Award Show of 1976.)  David Straihern plays one of the few fellow cops Rachel can trust and Monica Bellucci looks great in her couple scenes as another UN official.It seemed to me that there was much cut out of this film, but we will never know since there are no deleted scenes.  The editing seemed a bit confusing at times.  The only special feature was a short segment on the real Karen Bolkovic who, needless to say, looks nothing like Rachel Weicz.This film is hard to take at times but is recommended if you want to be aware of a shocking and disgusting activity that is still thriving in parts of the world.",4,"A Good Film, But Don't Let the Cover Fool You",1327968000,"01 31, 2012",2012,2325,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'Rachel', 'Weicz', 'Mummy', 'films', 'so', 'when', 'saw', 'cover', 'blu-ray', 'box', 'decided', 'check', 'out', 'only', 'vaguely', 'remembered', 'film', 'playing', 'theaters', 'so', 'had', 'little', 'go', 'cover', 'Rachel', 'leather', 'jacket', 'most', 'film', 'holding', 'what', 'be', 'pistol', 'However', 'are', 'expecting', 'Rachel', 'Dirty', 'Harriet', 'will', 'be', 'sadly', 'disappointed', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'one', 'scene', 'film', 'where', 'actually', 'holding', 'gun', 'cover', 'matter', 'fact', 'film', 'really', 'action', 'all.Rachel', 'stars', 'Karen', 'Bolkovic', 'Nebraska', 'police', 'officer', 'money', 'problems', 'part', 'UN', 'sponsored', 'international', 'police', 'force', 'stationed', 'Bosnia', 'there', 'sad', 'fact', 'white', 'slavery', 'human', 'trafficking', 'girls', 'prostitution', 'UN', 'powers-that-be', 'are', 'well-aware', 'fellow', 'policemen', 'are', 'actually', 'involved', 'profiting', 'girls', 'trapped', 'horrible', 'life', 'are', 'raped', 'constantly', 'film', 'not', 'shy', 'away', 'difficult', 'scenes', 'suspense', 'film', 'gradually', 'fired', 'job', 'must', 'obtain', 'smuggle', 'out', 'files', 'indicating', 'superiors', 'knowledge', 'what', 'been', 'going', 'film', 'abrupt', 'positive', 'conclusion.Weicz', 'great', 'usual', 'good', 'matter', 'what', 'role', 'playing', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'UN', 'official', 'sympathetic', 'Rachel', 'plight', 'one', 'point', 'film', 'UN', 'was', 'created', 'prevent', 'Auschwitz', 'thought', 'was', 'amusing', 'coming', 'actress', 'who', 'blasted', 'Zionist', 'Hoodlums', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Show', '1976', 'David', 'Straihern', 'one', 'few', 'fellow', 'cops', 'Rachel', 'can', 'trust', 'Monica', 'Bellucci', 'great', 'couple', 'scenes', 'UN', 'official.It', 'seemed', 'was', 'much', 'cut', 'out', 'film', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'editing', 'seemed', 'bit', 'confusing', 'times', 'only', 'special', 'feature', 'was', 'short', 'segment', 'real', 'Karen', 'Bolkovic', 'who', 'needless', 'say', 'nothing', 'Rachel', 'Weicz.This', 'film', 'hard', 'take', 'times', 'recommended', 'want', 'be', 'aware', 'shocking', 'disgusting', 'activity', 'still', 'thriving', 'parts', 'world']","The Whistleblower [2010, Canada] DVD Starring Rachel Weisz & Monica Bellucci"

Nevertheless, I select ""this story"" as the most harrowing of them all. Ironically, it is persuasive by not being overly graphic.  But the discovery of the crime and the efforts of a lone crusader - a moral police woman  - to try to stop this in Bosnia and protect the girls is truly gut wrenching.  What sticks in my mind is how much corruption exists in all levels of local, foreign, and U.N. agencies.This is not just a worthwhile movie, it is a necessary one. Unlike a few other reviewers, I did not find the pace slow; the scriptwriter took time to set the stage and let the facts flow naturally - making the movie an astonishingly tense thriller.  I have the highest regard for Rachel Weisz's performance - one of her best. Indeed all the performances are realistic and top notch.How important is this film?  Consider that in Argentina...human trafficking was legal...until one mother fought the police, the legal system, and the country to change the laws while still looking for her daughter - who may still be alive but working in misery as a forced prostitute. Everything about this movie rings true to me.  Consider also that sex slavery is the second biggest illegal business in the world - yielding billions of dollars in profits every year at the expense of others' dignity.I never felt that the director was exploiting the subject matter to show either sex or violence.  Instead the director focuses on the fear in the victims' eyes and body language when they are given the choice to testify against their aggressors...or not.

I had seen this film during its original theatrical release three years ago, and in watching it this time, on DVD (which arrived promptly and in perfect, spotless condition), I was again very much moved by this powerful depiction of Kathryn Bolkovac's tremendous and most courageous efforts to rescue women and girls brutally forced and trafficked into prostitution in post-war Bosnia.  In watching ""The Whistleblower"", I was sickened, disgusted, and angered to learn there was international collusion in the trafficking ring she uncovered and exposed to the world.  Although ""The Whistleblower"" is advertised as a dramatization, the scenes depicted in this movie are based on real events and experiences that actually happened, which makes it even more chilling.  This movie contains graphic depictions of real-life violence that actually occurred, so you would have to have a pretty strong stomach in order to watch.  Rachel Weisz is a gifted actress, and her portrayal of Kathryn Bolkovac is powerful, realistic, and inspiring.

1503169,A328S9RN3U5M68,B005TC5AEA,Grady Harp,"[35, 39]","THE WHISTLEBLOWER is a film that kicks you in the stomach and then continues to play out the worst possible truths that we'd rather not admit exist.  The theme of the film is Human Trafficking, and apparently there are about 2.5 million victims around the world today  - young people who are sold into sexual slavery for the financial gain of people from all areas of life, including our own government, the International Practices Task Force, and contracted companies supported by the US Government to rebuild who are  assigned to third world countries and countries besieged by or recovering from war, and in our own cities in this country. This film is based on a true story, a story written (and discussed in the bonus track on the DVD) by Kathryn Bolkovac who was transferred from her police job in Lincoln, Nebraska to Bosnia (with the promise of $100,000. and a six month term) to monitor the local Sarajevo police and advise them on proper police procedures. Bolkovac's story was written for the screen by Eilis Kirwan and director Larysa Kondracki who also directed the story with stinging reality.Kathryn Bolkovac (Rachel Weisz) is a recently divorced mother of a young girl who has lost custody of her daughter because of her constant commitment to her job.  When she is offered a lot of money and an advancement if she will go to Bosnia on a special assignment she accepts, feeling that if she ha money she can return home to live close to her young daughter.  When she arrives in Sarajevo she is treated with distance from the colleagues with whom she will be working. Her first accomplishment is bringing to justice the abuse of a Muslim woman who has been constantly a victim of spousal abuse - something not considered a crime until Kathryn proves it in court. She soon discovers that there is a human trafficking problem in Bosnia where young girls are brought into the country, sold as sex slaves to tend to the needs and whims and cruel and often sadistic whims of the IPTF (International Practices Task Force) as well as the US and international soldiers assigned by the UN to cover the recovery of Bosnia.  She visits the bars where the girls are kept, finds evidence of physical violence and abuse in the filth of the atrocious living conditions the girls are subjected to, and begins her attempts to save the girls - particularly Raya (Roxana Condurache) and Luba (Paula Schramm) whom she promises to protect if they will testify about their conditions.  Kathryn seeks solace from a Dutch compatriot boyfriend Jan (Nikolaj Lie Kaas) and takes her case to the UN person in charge (Monica Bellucci)  who is a by-the-rules leader and cannot offer help to Kathryn.  Kathryn is contacted by Madeleine Rees (Vanessa Redgrave), the High Commissioner for Human Rights  who aids her in her plight and puts her in contact with Peter Ward (David Strathairn), in Internal Affairs chief of the UN complex.  Kathryn finally discovers that the perpetrators of the human trafficking are the very people with whom she works and she is ultimately fired from her position. But before she leaves she releases the documents she has created that prove the victims of human trafficking are under the direction and service of the employees of the UN - in many ways her dangerous mission has been accomplished and the Democra, a security contractor, is exposed.Rachel Weisz brings a very human quality to her role, making her transformation into a heroine for the abused victims all the more credible.  Her performance is outstanding - and in the conversation with the real life Kathryn Bolkovac in the bonus feature with the film the manner in which Weisz succeeded in her role is all the more impressive.  This is a tough movie to watch, but it is a necessary statement to make the heinous crime of human trafficking more widely known and punished throughout the world.  Highly Recommended.

While there, she witnesses human sex trafficking and finds out that the very people she works with - UN peacekeepers and private American security contractors - are involved in this trafficking - not only as ""clientele"" but also as drivers, enablers, etc. She also finds out that people higher up, including the State Department and the top brass at UN in charge of the peacekeeping mission, are complicit. Ultimately, she gets fired for stirring things up and causing trouble.The Whistleblower is one of those movies that moves you, that talks to your inner conscience and stirs your sense of justice. It makes you want to get up and do something. It makes you feel bad about yourself, that somehow you are complicit in this because you didn't do anything against it. It also gives voice to those voiceless thousands whose lives were shattered because of sex trafficking. It is a movie in which you see the human capacity for both evil and goods, in its extremes. It also made me wonder why I had not heard about this or read about this in the media at all. It is not possible to feel optimistic about the state of the world, about governments or international institutions' capacity for doing good in this world after watching this movie. It makes you think that these institutions are all corrupt, and that the corruption permeates the entire organization. It was mind boggling that some of the very people involved in sex trafficking also had diplomatic immunity or were simply sent home without any criminal investigation. This is not an easy to watch movie - I can't remember how many times I wished the protagonist would just kick the bad guys' asses here; but I also found it very rewarding.If you are not in the mood to be bothered bothered by unpleasant realities, I suggest you avoid this.

Then there was the 99% of the UN, military and security males all conspiring to, covering up or ignorant of female sex trafficking.

After a book by a female American police officer who spent some time as a member of the US contingent in the UN Peacekeeping Force in Bosnia after the recent war. Played brilliantly by Rachel Weisz, whom I do not always find as convincing as here.Kathy is actually employed by a private security firm based in England. (This abomination of employing private firms for public jobs is a whole separate subject; the US government has a lot to answer for in this respect.) Her employer has a contract with the State Department. When she takes the job she expects to find herself among an elite police corps. In reality she finds herself among a bunch of thugs. Corruption and cynicism dominate the outlook of her colleagues.She finds herself confronted with the plight of victims of sexual slavery: young girls from all kinds of countries (Ukraine and Chechnya are specially mentioned) are held in brothels that cater to the foreign troops and other internationals. She tries to help and promises safety to those who will speak up. When she starts making efforts against the system, she runs into stiff opposition and gets finally shafted by her employer without a chance to help the victims. Her only victory is in a BBC supported publicity campaign against the practices that she discovered.Is this story an argument against the UN? I don't think so. It is an argument against war and peacekeeping forces and against employing private companies for military or police functions.As the cynical UN country chief of the story says: prostitution in war happens. He lives the pragmatic wisdom that eggs must be broken for the production of omelettes. Abominable man, and probably taken from real life on a one to one scale.It is unrealistic to expect soldiers on peacekeeping missions to behave differently from men in masses under war conditions. Unrealistic. Is it an argument against the UN system? Hardly. It is an argument against wars and peacekeeping and turning war into private business.

In particular,(not clever) the main character Kathryn repeatedly jeopardizes her investigation by carelessly tipping off the bad guys, from confronting the whole group at lunch near the beginning of her investigation to emailing the director her accusations without first securing or copying the evidence. She literally found a treasure-trove of irrefutable evidence (pictures, videos, documents) of her coworkers' participation, and yet she stores the evidence in the place where they all work without copying this evidence and sending it to her superiors or the media.(weak) Kathryn's female boss provides encouragement but absolutely no help throughout the movie, seeming especially weak despite her position of power.

Similarly, the only other female UN peacekeeper refuses to lend Kathryn her key to the building, whimpering ""I'm not like you"".

Some of her final scenes in the film are Oscar-worthy and underscore a number of sickening truths that have been developed throughout the script.From the first few minutes, it's pretty clear that the story isn't going to have a happy ending and once you see what military contractors and UN officials were conspiring to achieve, it's enough to make you want to write letters to your elected representatives.

She works on the police department in Lincoln Nebraska and she wants to relocate to Georgia to be near her daughter.  She is divorced twice and her ex-husband is taking the daughter with him when he moves because he has parental custody of her.  Kathryn can't find a job in law enforcement in Georgia and doesn't have the money to just move and spend time looking for work.  Her present boss recommends to her to join the United Nations Peace Keeping Force in Bosnia and make over $100,000, tax free, for 6 months' worth of work.  She takes the job to earn money for her relocation.She is thrown into a world that she doesn't recognize where racial, religious and ethnic hatred is rampant.  Women are treated like second class citizens and she soon finds much worse.  She finds a thriving human slavery trade for young girls and women who are treated like dogs and sold as sex toys to men for large sums of money.  Worse than that the police are totally corrupt and the UN Peace Keeping Force is involved by taking bribes , helping transport women across the border and participating in the torture of the captured hostages.....The movie is based on a true story and it is worth watching.  It definitely is graphic and shocking so be warned.  You will be shocked and frustrated as the storyline tells how the UN officers are one of the main reasons that the girls are brought into slavery in the area and that they have immunity for any criminal activity that they are involved in.Kathryn's bravery and determination not to give up until the story is brought to light is amazing.  The men involved play rough and use every method to intimidate her like they have their captive slaves.  It is a horrific story that will make you mad as the people empowered to protect the civilians are the worst part of the problem after the war.  Everyone from the top down lies and tries to cover up the horrendous things done by the UN Peace Keepers.

1503194,A111TATNFNSU3X,B005TC5AEA,Knight Poet,"[11, 33]","This movie is a good example of a bad exploitation film. The graphical depictions of violence were totally unnecessary. Great movie makers have learned that it is usually best to show less so that audiences will think more while amateur hacks leave nothing to the imagination of their viewers except the occasional need to imaginatively find something close at hand to use as a barf bag. All of these disgustingly repulsive scenes of physical torture and emotional abuse were included only to shock and nauseate us not to educate or enlighten us especially since they weren't condensed scenes but rather appeared to be intentionally prolonged as though to extend the sadistic torturing of the audience.Some people might try and justify the inclusion of these grotesquely distasteful scenes by claiming that people need to see what is really going on in order to change things. I heartily disagree. Do I need to see a snuff film to know that murdering another human being is morally wrong? No. And if I did want to watch the lingering shadow of death stripping bodies of all signs of life, all I need to do is watch CNN's coverage of the atrocities going on in Syria (today is 3-12-12) where some homicidal maniac continues to ruthlessly slaughter innocent men, women and children who are the very citizens he has a sacred obligation as their leader to safeguard and protect!

1503200,A18NTI5V03ZD6Y,B005TC5AEA,m4tch,"[2, 2]","Based on a true story, Whistleblower is a chilling film tracking the UN, US and Government Agencies involved in the sex trafficking rings in Bosnia during UN intervention in the late 90s. The film opens in Nebraska with Weisz as a divorced mother whose ex-husband has full custody of their daughter and is moving them to Georgia. Although Weisz is a hard working cop, she&#8217;s unable to transfer to a department in Georgia where she can be closer to her daughter. A well paying opportunity comes up to work as a UN police officer and the movie then follows her to Bosnia where she fights tooth and nail to protect and get justice for the women being trafficked. Throughout the movie we see the religious and ethnic tensions in Bosnia (Sarajevo), the lack of investigations and arrests of domestic violence cases and more importantly the large and deep level of corruption from the majority of people who surround her. By the end of the movie we see that despite her detailed cases of each victim, the criminals have diplomatic immunity and are simply sent back home. With the large target on her back, Weisz&#8217;s investigations are all shut down and she&#8217;s fired; but this does not stop her from releasing all her files publicly to at least give these victims a voice.As other viewers have warned, at times this is a hard movie to sit through as the content is often times horrific (even just to imagine). If you are able to watch any of the Dragon Tattoo movie collections then I&#8217;m confident you could watch The Whistleblower. This movie really makes you think and leaves you in awe that such low life corruption could take place, much less in the UN or our government. Of the statistics at the end of the film, I feel the number of trafficked victims around the world (2.5 million) is most likely inaccurate and IMO low. I recommend watching this movie, the acting is good and it exposes the reality and the not so pretty side of life that with enough viewers could potentially change the course of these atrocities.",5,No one likes a whistleblower,1384992000,"11 21, 2013",2013,2035,"['Based', 'true', 'story', 'Whistleblower', 'chilling', 'film', 'tracking', 'UN', 'US', 'Government', 'Agencies', 'involved', 'sex', 'trafficking', 'rings', 'Bosnia', 'UN', 'intervention', 'late', '90s', 'film', 'Nebraska', 'Weisz', 'divorced', 'mother', 'ex-husband', 'full', 'custody', 'daughter', 'moving', 'Georgia', 'Weisz', 'hard', 'working', 'cop', '8217', 'unable', 'transfer', 'department', 'Georgia', 'where', 'can', 'be', 'closer', 'daughter', 'well', 'paying', 'opportunity', 'up', 'work', 'UN', 'police', 'officer', 'movie', 'then', 'Bosnia', 'where', 'nail', 'protect', 'get', 'justice', 'women', 'being', 'trafficked', 'movie', 'see', 'religious', 'ethnic', 'tensions', 'Bosnia', 'Sarajevo', 'lack', 'investigations', 'arrests', 'domestic', 'violence', 'cases', 'more', 'importantly', 'large', 'deep', 'level', 'corruption', 'majority', 'people', 'who', 'surround', 'end', 'movie', 'see', 'detailed', 'cases', 'victim', 'criminals', 'have', 'diplomatic', 'immunity', 'are', 'simply', 'sent', 'back', 'home', 'large', 'target', 'back', 'Weisz', '8217', 's', 'investigations', 'are', 'shut', 'down', '8217', 'fired', 'not', 'stop', 'releasing', 'files', 'publicly', 'least', 'give', 'victims', 'voice.As', 'other', 'viewers', 'have', 'warned', 'times', 'hard', 'movie', 'sit', 'content', 'often', 'times', 'horrific', 'even', 'just', 'imagine', 'are', 'able', 'watch', 'Dragon', 'Tattoo', 'movie', 'collections', 'then', '8217', 'confident', 'could', 'watch', 'Whistleblower', 'movie', 'really', 'think', 'awe', 'such', 'low', 'life', 'corruption', 'could', 'take', 'place', 'much', 'less', 'UN', 'government', 'statistics', 'end', 'film', 'feel', 'number', 'trafficked', 'victims', 'world', '2.5', 'million', 'most', 'likely', 'inaccurate', 'IMO', 'low', 'recommend', 'watching', 'movie', 'acting', 'good', 'reality', 'not', 'so', 'pretty', 'side', 'life', 'enough', 'viewers', 'could', 'potentially', 'change', 'course', 'atrocities']","The Whistleblower [2010, Canada] DVD Starring Rachel Weisz & Monica Bellucci"

1503203,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B005TC5AEA,Mark Turner,"[10, 11]","I've never been a big fan of message movies. It seems far too often the message gets lost in the whims of the director or actor involved and the real story is buried. But occasionally a movie comes along where the story being told, the facts beneath it all, are so strong that they ease their way into you brain and ferment there, taking hold and forcing you to witness what it was all about. THE WHISTLEBLOWER is one such movie.It's 1999 and Rachel Weisz stars as Kathryn Bolkovac, a police woman with problems. Her ex-husband has sued for and won full custody of their daughter and is moving her to Georgia. Kathryn requested a transfer to the Georgia State Police but they don't have any openings at the moment and with a mortgage to worry about she can't just up and move. Then fate steps in and provides her with a chance to make great money for just 6 months work. That job is as a privately run security force connected to the United Nations forces working in Bosnia.Kathryn takes the job thinking she'll just be doing regular police work in another country, helping folks in need and having her back watched by fellow officers. Her first taste of controversy arrives when she comes to the aid of a Muslim woman constantly beaten by her husband. The local police could care less since she's a Muslim. Through her knowledge of law and the with the help of a sympathetic officer, Kathryn gets justice for the woman, a first concerning Muslim women in the area. This comes to the notice of others at the United Nations.Kathryn is offered a chance to work in the Human Rights commission and jumps at the chance. During one of her investigations she learns of a group of young girls who have been severely abused to the point of torture. In talking to them they lead her to investigate a local bar where she finds pictures of the girls being sexually and physically abused in the worst conditions possible. A room with dirty mattresses and chains to hold the girls is found with used condoms and needles strewn around. In checking the pictures she finds Kathryn discovers that various members of the private contractor peace force she joined are a part of this group as are members of the local police.Kathryn takes this news to her supervisor and is asked to pursue the matter. She talks one of two girls into testifying about the abuse and the men who were involved. Called away, her ally in the force takes the girl to testify only to be ambushed and have her taken from him. Returned to the hole she was removed from, the young girl is tortured in front of the rest on hand as a way of showing them what will happen if they talk.Kathryn continues to search for the young girl in hopes of finding her and honoring her promise to keep her safe. Seeing the girl's mother who arrived before she was taken only causes Kathryn more pain. With no one to help her, with all those around her viewing her as the enemy, she finds aid in the group she's worked for at the UN.  Can she save this young girl in time?The end of the story in real life had so so results. The employees of the company involved in the story were removed from the area but not tried in court. An investigation into human trafficking was begun and the depth of the problem was unimaginable. But the costs involved were high. The career of Kathryn Bolkovac was ruined. The problem though slowed remains.The great thing about this movie is that it doesn't pull punches. It wants you, the viewer, to realize just how bad the situation is. It wants you to see just how hopeless the lives of these girls become. And it wants you to know that there are people in this world possessed of an evil so overpowering that human life means nothing to them. In a world where we consider the disruption of cable in the middle of a game to be horrific, its hard to imagine a world like that depicted here. But perhaps with movies like this more people will be made aware.Weisz does a tremendous job here pulling out both the naive ness of her character at first and then the realization that she may have taken on more than she could handle. The feeling of being helpless in a foreign land, of not knowing who you can trust, is on full display in her performance and she does it with ease. You will believe she is Kathryn Bolkovac. And you will realize that this problem is not one that will go away easily.",3,SAD BUT TRUE,1332806400,"03 27, 2012",2012,4360,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'message', 'movies', 'far', 'too', 'often', 'message', 'lost', 'whims', 'director', 'actor', 'involved', 'real', 'story', 'buried', 'occasionally', 'movie', 'along', 'where', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'facts', 'are', 'so', 'strong', 'ease', 'way', 'brain', 'ferment', 'there', 'taking', 'hold', 'forcing', 'witness', 'what', 'was', 'WHISTLEBLOWER', 'one', 'such', 'movie.It', '1999', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'Kathryn', 'Bolkovac', 'police', 'woman', 'problems', 'ex-husband', 'sued', 'won', 'full', 'custody', 'daughter', 'moving', 'Georgia', 'Kathryn', 'requested', 'transfer', 'Georgia', 'State', 'Police', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'openings', 'moment', 'mortgage', 'worry', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'up', 'move', 'Then', 'fate', 'steps', 'chance', 'make', 'great', 'money', 'just', '6', 'months', 'work', 'job', 'privately', 'run', 'security', 'force', 'connected', 'United', 'Nations', 'forces', 'working', 'Bosnia.Kathryn', 'job', 'thinking', ""'ll"", 'just', 'be', 'doing', 'regular', 'police', 'work', 'country', 'helping', 'folks', 'need', 'having', 'back', 'watched', 'fellow', 'officers', 'first', 'taste', 'controversy', 'arrives', 'when', 'aid', 'Muslim', 'woman', 'constantly', 'beaten', 'husband', 'local', 'police', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'Muslim', 'knowledge', 'law', 'help', 'sympathetic', 'officer', 'Kathryn', 'justice', 'woman', 'first', 'concerning', 'Muslim', 'women', 'area', 'notice', 'others', 'United', 'Nations.Kathryn', 'offered', 'chance', 'work', 'Human', 'Rights', 'commission', 'jumps', 'chance', 'one', 'investigations', 'group', 'young', 'girls', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'severely', 'abused', 'point', 'torture', 'talking', 'lead', 'investigate', 'local', 'bar', 'where', 'pictures', 'girls', 'being', 'sexually', 'physically', 'abused', 'worst', 'conditions', 'possible', 'room', 'dirty', 'mattresses', 'chains', 'hold', 'girls', 'found', 'used', 'condoms', 'needles', 'strewn', 'around', 'checking', 'pictures', 'Kathryn', 'discovers', 'various', 'members', 'private', 'contractor', 'peace', 'force', 'joined', 'are', 'part', 'group', 'are', 'members', 'local', 'police.Kathryn', 'news', 'supervisor', 'asked', 'pursue', 'matter', 'one', 'two', 'girls', 'testifying', 'abuse', 'men', 'who', 'were', 'involved', 'Called', 'away', 'ally', 'force', 'girl', 'testify', 'only', 'be', 'ambushed', 'have', 'taken', 'Returned', 'hole', 'was', 'removed', 'young', 'girl', 'tortured', 'front', 'rest', 'hand', 'way', 'showing', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'talk.Kathryn', 'search', 'young', 'girl', 'hopes', 'finding', 'honoring', 'promise', 'keep', 'safe', 'Seeing', 'girl', 'mother', 'who', 'arrived', 'was', 'taken', 'only', 'Kathryn', 'more', 'pain', 'one', 'help', 'viewing', 'enemy', 'aid', 'group', 'worked', 'UN', 'Can', 'save', 'young', 'girl', 'time', 'end', 'story', 'real', 'life', 'had', 'so', 'so', 'results', 'employees', 'company', 'involved', 'story', 'were', 'removed', 'area', 'not', 'tried', 'court', 'investigation', 'human', 'trafficking', 'was', 'begun', 'depth', 'problem', 'was', 'unimaginable', 'costs', 'involved', 'were', 'high', 'career', 'Kathryn', 'Bolkovac', 'was', 'ruined', 'problem', 'slowed', 'remains.The', 'great', 'thing', 'movie', ""n't"", 'pull', 'punches', 'viewer', 'realize', 'just', 'how', 'bad', 'situation', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'hopeless', 'lives', 'girls', 'become', 'know', 'are', 'people', 'world', 'possessed', 'evil', 'so', 'overpowering', 'human', 'life', 'nothing', 'world', 'where', 'consider', 'disruption', 'cable', 'middle', 'game', 'be', 'horrific', 'hard', 'imagine', 'world', 'depicted', 'here', 'perhaps', 'movies', 'more', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'made', 'aware.Weisz', 'tremendous', 'job', 'here', 'pulling', 'out', 'naive', 'ness', 'character', 'first', 'then', 'realization', 'may', 'have', 'taken', 'more', 'could', 'handle', 'feeling', 'being', 'helpless', 'foreign', 'land', 'not', 'knowing', 'who', 'can', 'trust', 'full', 'display', 'performance', 'ease', 'will', 'believe', 'Kathryn', 'Bolkovac', 'will', 'realize', 'problem', 'not', 'one', 'will', 'go', 'away', 'easily']","The Whistleblower [2010, Canada] DVD Starring Rachel Weisz & Monica Bellucci"

1503212,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B005TC5AEA,M. Oleson,"[0, 0]","Rachel Weisz has become one of my favorite actresses these days with a smattering of terrific performances.  She doesn't disappoint here playing Kathy Bolkovac a real life Nebraska police officer.  Her personal life has been complicated by a recent divorce.  She has a teenage daughter but her ex has been given custody.  He lives in Georgia.  We don't get any back-story on why this unlikely arrangement was granted but the movie is based on real events.  Unable to get a transfer to be closer to her daughter, Bolkovac signs on for a 6 month gig in Bosnia as part of the police keeping force following the Bosnian civil war that ended in the mid-1990's.When she arrives, she discovers that teenage girls are being used as sex slaves and trafficked to various bidders.  What is even more shocking is that the trade is supported by local police, UN peacekeepers including Americans and others.  While gathering evidence, Bolkovac is stymied by her superiors and is ultimately removed from the force.  This is a depressing and morally repugnant film involving brutal rapes and the revolting behavior of men charged with rebuilding the nation.  As an attractive lone wolf, Bolkovac's own safety is often exposed.Unfortunately the events lead to an eventual exposure of the criminal activity but few, if any of the key players were ever brought to justice.  An underlying theme revolves around the fact that most of the American's were private contractors, immune from prosecution.  Director Larysa Kondracki's film is far from perfect.  It seems to move along in herky jerky fashion.  Supporting actors Vanessa Redgrave and David Strathhairn add some heft but make no mistake, this is Rachel Weisz's film.The Blu ray transfer is in 1080p with a 2.35:1 aspect ratio.  The film is purposefully dark and grim as is the color palet, or lack of.  The picture is clear but with expected grain.  In some of the darkest scenes, detail is iffy but I suspect this was intended.  Likewise the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack is pretty straight forward with most of the dialog centered movie up front.  Surrounds are used mostly for background chatter and noisy scenes.  In one case I did have to raise the volume to understand a character who spoke in a strong Serbian accent.

1503219,A2R1GFS6P1PC18,B005TC5AEA,Peter Baklava,"[2, 2]","I think the low number of reviews here reflects on the nature of the film.  It's hard-hitting, grim, and pessimistic.  Some critics have complained that it gets bogged down in its pessimism, and offers too predictable a picture of evil corporatists exploiting a degraded country.But I, for one, appreciated the low key nature of the film, and even the purposely, largely affectless performance of Rachel Weisz.  It is easy to contrast this movie with big-budget thrillers like ""Taken"" with Liam Neeson, and ""Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" with Rooney Mara.  In those two examples, corruption is vanquished by unbelievable, one-dimensional heroes endowed with superhuman abilities.In ""The Whistleblower"", Rachel Weisz's character isn't a vehicle for moviegoers to vicariously enjoy punishing the baddies.  Her character is unglamorous, human, and restrained. ( What a relief to see a character that doesn't metamorphize into a fire-breathing, kick-boxing avenger.)  She merely observes, and tries to act within the limits of what is humanly possible.Some people may also be frustrated that the good angels of the movie (David Strathairn and Vanessa Redgrave) flicker in and out, and offer limited encouragement.  The guys at the top of the ""bad guy"" ladder are, of course, too powerful to challenge and the epitome of intelligent evil. They, too, are given very limited screen-time and remain mysterious.  Here again, I thought the movie's restraint was effective.  There are no bombastic showdowns, and the nature of the web of evil that controls the trafficking operation is never fully revealed.  The movie does not attempt to be omniscient, but provides the partial understanding that is natural to the human condition.  Again, realistic.  However, the movie's failing may be the one-dimensionality of the bad guys, who seem to inhabit a cult of inhumanity that even goes beyond fascism.Still, I liked it and will watch it again.",4,riveting and (mostly) believable,1331164800,"03 8, 2012",2012,1930,"['think', 'low', 'number', 'reviews', 'here', 'nature', 'film', 'hard-hitting', 'grim', 'pessimistic', 'critics', 'have', 'complained', 'bogged', 'down', 'pessimism', 'too', 'predictable', 'picture', 'evil', 'corporatists', 'exploiting', 'degraded', 'country.But', 'one', 'appreciated', 'low', 'key', 'nature', 'film', 'even', 'purposely', 'largely', 'affectless', 'performance', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'easy', 'contrast', 'movie', 'big-budget', 'thrillers', 'Taken', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'Girl', 'Dragon', 'Tattoo', 'Rooney', 'Mara', 'two', 'examples', 'corruption', 'vanquished', 'unbelievable', 'one-dimensional', 'heroes', 'endowed', 'superhuman', 'abilities.In', 'Whistleblower', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'character', ""n't"", 'vehicle', 'moviegoers', 'vicariously', 'enjoy', 'punishing', 'baddies', 'character', 'unglamorous', 'human', 'restrained', 'What', 'relief', 'see', 'character', ""n't"", 'metamorphize', 'fire-breathing', 'kick-boxing', 'avenger', 'merely', 'tries', 'act', 'limits', 'what', 'humanly', 'possible.Some', 'people', 'may', 'also', 'be', 'frustrated', 'good', 'angels', 'movie', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'flicker', 'offer', 'limited', 'encouragement', 'guys', 'top', 'bad', 'guy', 'ladder', 'are', 'course', 'too', 'powerful', 'challenge', 'epitome', 'intelligent', 'evil', 'too', 'are', 'given', 'very', 'limited', 'screen-time', 'remain', 'mysterious', 'Here', 'again', 'thought', 'movie', 'restraint', 'was', 'effective', 'are', 'bombastic', 'showdowns', 'nature', 'web', 'evil', 'trafficking', 'operation', 'never', 'fully', 'revealed', 'movie', 'not', 'attempt', 'be', 'omniscient', 'partial', 'understanding', 'natural', 'human', 'condition', 'Again', 'realistic', 'However', 'movie', 'failing', 'may', 'be', 'one-dimensionality', 'bad', 'guys', 'who', 'seem', 'inhabit', 'cult', 'inhumanity', 'even', 'fascism.Still', 'liked', 'will', 'watch', 'again']","The Whistleblower [2010, Canada] DVD Starring Rachel Weisz & Monica Bellucci"

Kathryn Bolkovac (Rachel Weisz), a Nebraska cop, is a divorced mom who takes a job with a security contractor for big pay and a short tour in the Balkans.  She discovers that ethnic tensions have caused local cops to refuse to investigate domestic violence cases, particularly those involving Muslims.  She is promoted and put in charge of gender affairs by a U.N. official (Vanessa Redgrave), but is increasingly frustrated.  After building cases against sexual traffickers, she's told they enjoy diplomatic immunity.Bolkovac is a lone crusader, persuading fearful women to testify against their abusers, bucking diplomatic hypocrisy, and dealing with rampant paranoia.  Ms. Weisz heads this topical political thriller, turning in a powerful performance, one of her best.  The movie underscores the collateral damage caused by politics and maintaining the delicate balance of world peace, though it's far more compelling as one strong woman's efforts to advocate for those without a voice.The sole special feature on this release, available in Blu-ray and DVD editions, is a featurette about real-life whistleblower Kathy Bolkovac.",4,Fighting human rights violations,1326758400,"01 17, 2012",2012,1231,"['Whistleblower', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'gritty', 'movie', 'sexual', 'trafficking', 'Bosnia', 'Kathryn', 'Bolkovac', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'Nebraska', 'cop', 'divorced', 'mom', 'who', 'job', 'security', 'contractor', 'big', 'pay', 'short', 'tour', 'Balkans', 'ethnic', 'tensions', 'have', 'caused', 'local', 'cops', 'refuse', 'investigate', 'domestic', 'violence', 'cases', 'particularly', 'involving', 'Muslims', 'promoted', 'put', 'charge', 'gender', 'affairs', 'U.N.', 'official', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'increasingly', 'frustrated', 'building', 'cases', 'sexual', 'traffickers', 'told', 'enjoy', 'diplomatic', 'immunity.Bolkovac', 'lone', 'crusader', 'persuading', 'fearful', 'women', 'testify', 'abusers', 'bucking', 'diplomatic', 'hypocrisy', 'dealing', 'rampant', 'paranoia', 'Ms.', 'Weisz', 'topical', 'political', 'thriller', 'turning', 'powerful', 'performance', 'one', 'best', 'movie', 'collateral', 'damage', 'caused', 'politics', 'maintaining', 'delicate', 'balance', 'world', 'peace', 'far', 'more', 'compelling', 'one', 'strong', 'woman', 'efforts', 'advocate', 'voice.The', 'sole', 'special', 'feature', 'release', 'available', 'Blu-ray', 'DVD', 'editions', 'featurette', 'real-life', 'whistleblower', 'Kathy', 'Bolkovac']","The Whistleblower [2010, Canada] DVD Starring Rachel Weisz & Monica Bellucci"

It is also one of those movies that deals with a horrifying subject and not one I'm likely to watch again, if only because of the nature of the subject and the way it is portrayed in the movie. This is a movie that is based on actual events.Rachel Weisz delivers a commanding performance as Kathryn Bolkovac, a Nebraska cop who takes up a job offer serving as a UN peacekeeper in post-war Bosnia. Kathryn is initially torn about her assignment because it means leaving her young daughter who lives with Kathryn's ex-husband. When she gets to Bosnia, she finds herself becoming gradually enmeshed in a sordid case, involving rampant corruption and cover-ups dealing with the trafficking of young girls in the underground sex trade. She tries to help two young trafficked victims who have managed to escape, but keeping them safe until they can testify proves almost impossible. Kathryn finds herself among the minority in trying to help these girls, as corruption is rampant and even the people at the highest levels refuse to take her allegations seriously.There are some terribly violent scenes in this movie that is not for the faint of heart, involving the torture of young victims and also suggestive pictures alluding to indiscriminate abuse. These scenes were not gratuitous but relevant to portray the actual horrors suffered by these young innocents at the hands of their abusers, and attested to by the real-life experiences of these girls as recorded in their interviews (Bolkovac had managed to retrieve the files).SPOILER ALERTThis is not a movie with a happy ending. It aims to expose and it does so credibly - that an organization that is highly respected such as the UN should cover up criminal activities perpetrated by some of its employees and independent contractors operating under its auspices is troubling and revolting. Justice is not really served in the end. The innocents suffer in silence, and none come to their aid. Kathryn tried and failed, but her courage has given her the strength to expose this crime and the people behind it. She is a true hero. For those interested, there is a book written by Bolkovac titledThe Whistleblower: Sex Trafficking, Military Contractors, and One Woman's Fight for Justice",5,"Corruption, human trafficking, and one woman's quest for justice",1331164800,"03 8, 2012",2012,2342,"['Whistleblower', 'one', 'powerful', 'movies', 'viewer', 'long', 'film', 'ended', 'also', 'one', 'movies', 'deals', 'horrifying', 'subject', 'not', 'one', ""'m"", 'likely', 'watch', 'again', 'only', 'nature', 'subject', 'way', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'movie', 'based', 'actual', 'events.Rachel', 'Weisz', 'commanding', 'performance', 'Kathryn', 'Bolkovac', 'Nebraska', 'cop', 'who', 'up', 'job', 'offer', 'serving', 'UN', 'peacekeeper', 'post-war', 'Bosnia', 'Kathryn', 'initially', 'torn', 'assignment', 'leaving', 'young', 'daughter', 'who', 'Kathryn', 'ex-husband', 'When', 'Bosnia', 'becoming', 'gradually', 'enmeshed', 'sordid', 'case', 'involving', 'rampant', 'corruption', 'cover-ups', 'dealing', 'trafficking', 'young', 'girls', 'underground', 'sex', 'trade', 'help', 'two', 'young', 'trafficked', 'victims', 'who', 'have', 'managed', 'escape', 'keeping', 'safe', 'can', 'testify', 'proves', 'almost', 'impossible', 'Kathryn', 'minority', 'trying', 'help', 'girls', 'corruption', 'rampant', 'even', 'people', 'highest', 'levels', 'refuse', 'take', 'allegations', 'are', 'terribly', 'violent', 'scenes', 'movie', 'not', 'faint', 'heart', 'involving', 'torture', 'young', 'victims', 'also', 'suggestive', 'pictures', 'alluding', 'indiscriminate', 'abuse', 'scenes', 'were', 'not', 'gratuitous', 'relevant', 'portray', 'actual', 'horrors', 'suffered', 'young', 'innocents', 'hands', 'abusers', 'attested', 'real-life', 'experiences', 'girls', 'recorded', 'interviews', 'Bolkovac', 'had', 'managed', 'retrieve', 'files', '.SPOILER', 'ALERTThis', 'not', 'movie', 'happy', 'ending', 'expose', 'so', 'credibly', 'organization', 'highly', 'respected', 'such', 'UN', 'should', 'cover', 'up', 'criminal', 'activities', 'perpetrated', 'employees', 'independent', 'contractors', 'operating', 'auspices', 'troubling', 'revolting', 'Justice', 'not', 'really', 'served', 'end', 'innocents', 'suffer', 'silence', 'none', 'come', 'aid', 'Kathryn', 'tried', 'failed', 'courage', 'given', 'strength', 'expose', 'crime', 'people', 'true', 'hero', 'interested', 'book', 'written', 'Bolkovac', 'titledThe', 'Whistleblower', 'Sex', 'Trafficking', 'Military', 'Contractors', 'One', 'Woman', 'Fight', 'Justice']","The Whistleblower [2010, Canada] DVD Starring Rachel Weisz & Monica Bellucci"
