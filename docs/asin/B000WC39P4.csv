1108259,A1N10ZN3IQUA6E,B000WC39P4,"Allen Berry ""Emerald Archer""","[0, 0]","I remember this series from the latter days of my undergrad years at college. It was in the cadre of syndicated offerings that Fox and some non-network channels offered during the early 90's, like Night Man, Super Boy, and Friday the Thirteenth the Series. It was fine Saturday afternoon fare for the overworked mind, and had it's special charm. The real prime mover of this series, produced by Universal Studios Florida who also created Super Boy, is stuntman/actor Dick Durock who starred in the 1982original and it's tongue in cheek sequel some seven years later.The stories are often cheesy, the performance by the actor who plays Dr. Arcane is the definition of &#34;over the top,&#34; and the supporting characters are at times so treacle, you'll need to brush your teeth after viewing, but let's be honest with each other: we watch for Swamp Thing. The series is a fine testimony to the work and talents of the late Dick Durock, who brought a dignity and gravitas to the character. He walks the marshy landscape of the series, fighting evil doers, polluters, orchid thieves, and Arcane's twisted genetic experiments with a grace that makes us admire and love him. Always returning to the depths of the swamp with a final observation on the episode's events like some herbal Rod Serling.It's easy to get caught up in action and forgive (if not forget) the shortcomings of the story and the supporting cast. For a b-grade syndicated TV series, the effects aren't horrible.  Bear in mind this predates the technology that made such wonders as say the pod race in Star Wars Episode One possible, so given that they had to do this the old way, their not bad.  And they get it right where it's important: Swamp Thing is flawlessly acquitted in green and vegetation, and does not look like a man in a Swamp Thing suit.",4,Dick Durock Reprises!

His translation to TV was good and  lasted three seasons. Remarkable for a NON MAJOR DC heroThe adventures of a man-turned-muck monster. Swamp Thing was once a man named Alec Holland, but after being caught on fire, doused with strange chemicals, and dumped into the Louisiana swamps by the evil Dr. Anton Arcane, Alec's body mutated. No longer is he human, or even an animal. His body is made from the muck and plants of the swamp. He's super strong and can make plants do his bidding. Good thing he's on our sideThis muck monster with a heart owes a debt to Frankenstein legend. Mark Chapman (not a relation to John Lennon's killer) plays the Thing's foil, Dr Arcane, a mad doctor who is doing expierements on mutations.The make up other than Swamp Thing costume was not always the greatest. For example, the Episode where Paul Mark Richman was man/falcon looked slightly cheesy, but it did seem to convey it..similar to some of the monsters from the 70s-80s Dr WhoDick Durrock plays the Thing with a heart. His origins were unexplained but in bits and pieces through the shows run, but it worked and made this a hitNow on DVD, you can relive the episodes. The episodes were tight without major sub plots and major character devices. These shows were told in half hour episodes which seem to workIts format was a simple good vs evil and it worksIt is rated four stars because they could have put some sort of commentary on a few episodes.

Compared to the comics or even the movies, this series is a pretty big letdown. Its obvious that they had some major budget issues because we get 95% of all episodes filmed in the daylight (no money for lights) and everything appears to be filmed within a 300 foot wide swamp setting. There is not a lot of exploration of the city they live in and even when people venture into the swamp its always the same few spots that they visit. The costume design for the Swamp Thing character is pretty good, but the costumes of the other creatures are humorous and pretty pathetic. The storylines as well really don't involve Swamp Thing in any major way, he is just kind of there to give sage advice and occasionally break out his plant power. There is one shining star and that is Mark Lindsay Chapman as Anton Arcane. I have never hated a villain so much since Dr. Pretorius in ""Bride Of Frankenstein"" or Bill the Butcher in ""Gangs Of New York"". You may not be crazy about his abilities, but it takes a really talented actor to make the audience hate him or her! I guess I have no complaints about Dick Durock's acting either, but considering the series is named after his character he is way too underutilized. I purchased it from Amazon for 6 or 7 bucks so it was worth getting, but if you're a real Swamp Thing nut and you are expecting dark, supernatural storylines then you should probably just stick with the comics or the Wes Craven film. After the first season it does get better, but overall it is still only worthy of 3 stars.",3,Budget Problems Make For A Mediocre Show,1308441600,"06 19, 2011",2011,1602,"['Let', 'start', 'saying', 'am', 'Swamp', 'Thing', 'fan', 'DC', 'Comics', 'fanatic', 'Compared', 'comics', 'even', 'movies', 'series', 'pretty', 'big', 'letdown', 'obvious', 'had', 'major', 'budget', 'issues', 'get', '95', '%', 'episodes', 'filmed', 'daylight', 'money', 'lights', 'everything', 'be', 'filmed', '300', 'foot', 'wide', 'swamp', 'setting', 'not', 'lot', 'exploration', 'city', 'live', 'even', 'when', 'people', 'venture', 'swamp', 'always', 'same', 'few', 'spots', 'visit', 'costume', 'design', 'Swamp', 'Thing', 'character', 'pretty', 'good', 'costumes', 'other', 'creatures', 'are', 'humorous', 'pretty', 'pathetic', 'storylines', 'well', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'involve', 'Swamp', 'Thing', 'major', 'way', 'just', 'kind', 'there', 'give', 'sage', 'advice', 'occasionally', 'break', 'out', 'plant', 'power', 'one', 'shining', 'star', 'Mark', 'Lindsay', 'Chapman', 'Anton', 'Arcane', 'have', 'never', 'hated', 'villain', 'so', 'much', 'Dr.', 'Pretorius', 'Bride', 'Frankenstein', 'Bill', 'Butcher', 'Gangs', 'New', 'York', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'crazy', 'abilities', 'really', 'talented', 'actor', 'make', 'audience', 'hate', 'guess', 'have', 'complaints', 'Dick', 'Durock', 'acting', 'considering', 'series', 'named', 'character', 'way', 'too', 'underutilized', 'purchased', 'Amazon', '6', '7', 'bucks', 'was', 'worth', 'getting', ""'re"", 'real', 'Swamp', 'Thing', 'nut', 'are', 'expecting', 'dark', 'supernatural', 'storylines', 'then', 'should', 'probably', 'just', 'stick', 'comics', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'film', 'first', 'season', 'get', 'better', 'overall', 'still', 'only', 'worthy', '3', 'stars']",Swamp Thing - The Series

1108276,A3A81ZZ4ANLZ8G,B000WC39P4,"The Critic ""Movie Maniac""","[5, 5]","Fans of the ""Swamp Thing"" have 22 reasons to Shout!  Based on the DC comic book character, the ""Swamp Thing"" made his debut in 1990 for the first time on television following the two movies from the 80's. For the first time ever fans can see all 22 episodes comprising of seasons one & two the way they were meant to be seen, in order. When the show was originally broadcast on the television the episodes were shown out of order making the story hard to follow at times.Dr. Anton Arcane is looking for a secret elixir; some would call it the fountain of youth. Through his research Dr. Alec Holland believes he has created a new chemical composition and its value could be immeasurable to the world. After being immersed with chemicals and set ablaze Dr. Alec Holland's badly burned body is thrown into the Louisiana swamp by the ruthless Dr. Arcane. After some time in the swamp Alec's body has begun to regenerate itself and it has now mutated into some form of plant & swamp creature. No longer human the ""Swamp Thing"" sets out to destroy the person responsible for causing his mutation. Welcome to the ""Swamp Thing"" seasons one & two on DVD.This half hour show wasn't always the best. Some stories were better than others and the show was definitely campy entertainment, but the swamp thing creature was well done and Dick Durock was good in reprising his role. This four disc set from Shout Factory is a must for any fan of the show. All 22 episodes are spread out over four single sided discs with great artwork and packaging. The video transfer in my opinion is excellent and the sound is crisp and clean. I have really enjoyed watching the first 22 episodes in order and gained a new appreciation for this show.The Cast:Dick Durock......Swamp ThingMark Lindsay Chapman....Dr. Anton ArcaneCarrell Myers....Tressa KippScott Garrison...Will KippKevin Quigley....GrahamSeasons 1 & 2 Episodes:1.
