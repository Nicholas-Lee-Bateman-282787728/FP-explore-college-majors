938495,A3BG5AR5KE6QYG,B000BB1520,Bill W,"[2, 3]","From a military history standpoint this is an excellent introduction to ""The Crusades"".  As a Religious history ""no one"" Jewish, Muslim or Christian is going to agree, there is just to much tradition, interpretation and dogma over the centuries separating all. Frankly all religions contrary to popular beliefs have blood on there hands.The other issue, is most modern viewers or readers are not going to understand the true nature of civilizations (East or West) in this remote time period. All military actions in this time frame were bloody slaughters with Armies laying waste and consuming any and all resources in their path. Even the basic conventions of warfare had been forgotten or had not developed as to the treatment civilians and POWs. My point is as we view or read a history we must keep the people in the time frame they existed to correctly judge their actions. Only having done this, can we judge the age in terms of our own.As I said I consider this only a introduction to the subject of the Crusades.  No one television documentary can do anything more than an incomplete survey. This presentation while much better than most is no exception. I personally would prefer to see more of a presentation of Strategic cause and effect, order of battle and tactical maneuver. What we get instead colored is Political intrigue and romance. Which I admit is interesting. Production values well above those of similar documentaries (case in point the Knight Templar piece included on second disk).",4,"Excellent Introduction  ""The Crusades""",1229731200,"12 20, 2008",2008,1507,"['military', 'history', 'standpoint', 'excellent', 'introduction', 'Crusades', 'Religious', 'history', 'one', 'Jewish', 'Muslim', 'Christian', 'going', 'agree', 'just', 'much', 'tradition', 'interpretation', 'dogma', 'centuries', 'separating', 'Frankly', 'religions', 'contrary', 'popular', 'beliefs', 'have', 'blood', 'other', 'issue', 'most', 'modern', 'viewers', 'readers', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'understand', 'true', 'nature', 'civilizations', 'East', 'West', 'remote', 'time', 'period', 'military', 'actions', 'time', 'frame', 'were', 'bloody', 'slaughters', 'Armies', 'laying', 'waste', 'consuming', 'resources', 'path', 'Even', 'basic', 'conventions', 'warfare', 'had', 'been', 'forgotten', 'had', 'not', 'developed', 'treatment', 'civilians', 'POWs', 'point', 'view', 'read', 'history', 'must', 'keep', 'people', 'time', 'frame', 'existed', 'correctly', 'judge', 'actions', 'Only', 'having', 'done', 'can', 'judge', 'age', 'terms', 'own.As', 'said', 'consider', 'only', 'introduction', 'subject', 'Crusades', 'one', 'television', 'documentary', 'can', 'do', 'anything', 'more', 'incomplete', 'survey', 'presentation', 'much', 'better', 'most', 'exception', 'personally', 'would', 'prefer', 'see', 'more', 'presentation', 'Strategic', 'cause', 'effect', 'order', 'battle', 'tactical', 'maneuver', 'What', 'get', 'instead', 'colored', 'Political', 'intrigue', 'romance', 'Which', 'admit', 'interesting', 'Production', 'values', 'well', 'similar', 'documentaries', 'case', 'point', 'Knight', 'Templar', 'piece', 'included', 'second', 'disk']",The History Channel Presents The Crusades - Crescent & The Cross

Although the producers presented both Christian and Muslim historians' points of view, I found a slight bias in favor of the Muslims as I watched this History Channel presentation of how and why, after 400 years of Muslim rule, the first Crusade to return Jerusalem to the Christians began. Overall, I enjoyed the presentation and it almost gives one the feeling of watching a narrated movie. The DVD presents the history of the three Crusades in two parts - Part One: The First Crusade and Part Two: The Second and Third Crusades. The audio and video quality of the DVD are very good to excellent, although there are no subtitles or captions and there are no extra features on the DVD. The DVD runs approximately 180 minutes and it contains a wealth of history and facts. For anyone interested in learning about the Crusades I recommend this DVD as a good overview of the historical conflict and battles between Christians and Muslims known these many centuries later as The Crusades.The History Channel Presents: The Crusades - Crescent & the Cross [Blu-ray]",4,Informative: A decent place to begin your study,1332633600,"03 25, 2012",2012,1346,"['recently', 'saw', 'Crusades', 'Crescent', 'Cross', 'found', 'be', 'good', 'way', 'begin', 'study', '200-year', 'period', 'Middle', 'Ages', 'spawned', 'first', 'three', 'Crusades', 'culminating', 'Richard', 'Lionheart', 'failed', 'attempt', 'take', 'keep', 'Jerusalem', 'Muslims', 'producers', 'presented', 'Christian', 'Muslim', 'historians', 'points', 'view', 'found', 'slight', 'bias', 'favor', 'Muslims', 'watched', 'History', 'Channel', 'presentation', 'how', 'why', '400', 'years', 'Muslim', 'rule', 'first', 'Crusade', 'return', 'Jerusalem', 'Christians', 'began', 'Overall', 'enjoyed', 'presentation', 'almost', 'one', 'feeling', 'watching', 'narrated', 'movie', 'DVD', 'history', 'three', 'Crusades', 'two', 'parts', 'Part', 'One', 'First', 'Crusade', 'Part', 'Two', 'Second', 'Third', 'Crusades', 'audio', 'video', 'quality', 'DVD', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'excellent', 'are', 'subtitles', 'captions', 'are', 'extra', 'features', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'approximately', '180', 'minutes', 'wealth', 'history', 'facts', 'anyone', 'interested', 'learning', 'Crusades', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'good', 'overview', 'historical', 'conflict', 'battles', 'Christians', 'Muslims', 'known', 'many', 'centuries', 'later', 'Crusades.The', 'History', 'Channel', 'Crusades', 'Crescent', 'Cross', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']']",The History Channel Presents The Crusades - Crescent & The Cross

Even one of the Muslim commentators seemed to make excuses for his vicious bahavior, saying ""you had to be back then"".The main point of the movie is that in the first Crusade the Christians ""took back"" Jerusalem from the Muslims. In the second Crusade, the muslims ""took back"" Jerusalem from the Christians. In the third Crusade the Christians tried unsuccessfully to retake Jerusalem back.This documetary left out one key point: Jerusalem belonged to NEITHER the Christians NOR the Muslims. The city of Jerusalem was originally inhabited by the Jews, but that fact seems to have gotten lost somewhere.Both Saladin and Richard I commited vicous crimes and they both murdered thousands of people. People seem to forget that Saladin probably murdered as many Knights Templar and Hospitalars as Richard did Muslims. They wer both cunning, vicious and excellent military Strategists. The documentary also states something that was probably true: After Years of Fighting each other they learned to respect each other as generals.This movie tried to be as objective as possible but there was a lot of Christian-bashing here, not that it wasn't deserved. Tariq whatever his name was seemed to be on a Crusade to make the Christians look as evil as possible. He defends Saladin's actions, when the fact is that both generals committed many what we call today ""war crimes"".

The eleventh and twelfth centuries were extremely brutal periods where brutality often overcame rationalism and reason.  The religious fervor which Christian and Muslim alike displayed towards one another is astounding at times, but one side, the Muslims, seem to have held onto the sense of history that Christians have forgotten.  The fact that nearly a thousand years after the events began Muslims still talk about crusaders and their wars is testimony that history is alive and well in certain cultures, but nearly dead in others.That this series only investigates the first three Crusades makes sense when one realizes the other Crusades either failed to get momentum at all, or fizzled before any strategic objectives were realized.  This series shows brutality on both sides (Christains are said to have killed nearly everyone, Muslim, Jew and Christian) when the entered Jerusalem at the end of the First Crusade.  Christains allegedly ate the victims of one Turkish fortress as a way of intimidation.  Muslims brutally killed captured Crusaders when they gained momentum after the Battle of Hattin.  In war no side is really ""innocent"" but one side wins a battle then claims the right to write the history putting its forces in the better light.This is a two disc set, but the real story is contained on disc one.

Bush may have viewed (and publicly referred to) his ""War on Terror"" as a crusade, historians (and most of us with at least a middle-school education) know that the word - not to mention the actual events - is much too powerful to simply throw around as a scare tactic. Thankfully the History Channel understands this concept as well; The Crusades: Crescent & The Cross presents the story of these wars, which included some of the most bloody and religiously charged battles of history.Although the story is set in the past, the similarities to current conflicts are clear. For while the techniques and technologies have certainly changed, unfortunately the underlying fears and philosophies have not. The Crusades explores the conflicts between two Middle Age superpowers - Christians and Muslims - fought over a period of two-centuries. The aftermath of the conflict decided the fate of the Holy Land - at least for a while - but left in its path the continuing struggles and conflict we have today.Unlike some documentaries that are often full of bad re-enactments and laden with tedious interviews with historians and academics, the History Channel's presentation is alive with excellent cinematography and high quality production value. The modern-day historians who are included provide excellent and engaging insight into the battles and beliefs of the Crusades, and the ancient locations where it all took place. The re-enactments are impressive, the acting solid, and the use of CGI excellent.

It doesn't bore the viewer with complex political going on's during the Crusade. Likewise the DVD is filled with live action sequences that presents the many battles in the eyes of those who witnessed it. The actors themselves were superb and held my interest to the very last. The only thing that sucks about live action fighting is the fact that you can tell that they aren't trying to hit each other.But while this hollywoodization of the crusades may serve the purpose of catching the attention of an ADHD america, it also ends up being its downfall. The DVD is a cliff notes version of the crusades For starters, the DVD isn't necessary a complete account of the crusades. Instead the producers skip to the juicy parts of the crusades and miss some other facts about the crusade. For example...why doesn't this DVD mention anything about the children's crusade? (which really wasn't a crusade of children). Or why don't they mention anything about Richard the Lionheart's conquest of European kingdoms (Sicily and Crete) on his way to the holy land? I mean wouldn't that only diminish their claim that all of Europe was somehow united by Pope Urban's racist crusade?what about Constantinople? A fallen Christian city that isn't mentioned a lot in this dvd. The DVD is obviously Israel centric, never do they mention the Muslim conquest of European lands. I would of liked to see that since that also seemed to be a crusade. In fact the DVD abruptly ends after the Richard the Lionhearts crusade and then fills in the gaps by suggesting that the wars in the past are effecting today's world. Not really, capitalism and internationalism is more of a reason for the explosion of modern terrorism then the crusade. The DVD only briefly hints at their role in today's society but never shows us the aftermath or other wars that involved the west vs. east. Were lead to believe that Christians were somehow the warmongers.Also did the producers actually knew they were making a DVD or did they just record over the show? Cause every now and then the screen fades out and then goes back with the words ""THE CRUSADES CRESENT AND THE CROSS"" at the bottom of the screen. Thanks for reminding of what im watching Historychannel. I totally forget that i put that DVD in there and pressed play!Then their is the issue of the recycle scenes.

It only covers the first three crusades, and the coverage of that is a bit superficial. Certainly, the causes and motivations for the Crusades could have been covered better. This might be explained by the slight bias towards the Muslim side. It is better balanced than some of the other reviewers indicate, however.Unfortunately, two scenes with one particular historian interview pretty much ruined it for me:First, after Saladin defeated one particular set of crusaders, he beheaded all the captured knights except the leader himself. Please note that the war was over, and Saladin had won. There was no real tactical advantage to executing the prisoners. Yet, one Middle Eastern historian describes this positively as some great display of power and prestige on the part of Saladin.Later, the same professor describes a different occasion, when Richard I was being besieged. In this case, Richard had a large number of Muslim prisoners. He firstly offered to do a prisoner exchange. Saladin refused for the obvious tactical reasoning. Richard could not feed them without reducing his own troops rations. So, Richard chose to execute them. The historian presents this as some sort of war crime!Why did History Channel let this pass? Saladin had no necessity to kill those knights, yet his murders were a great thing. Richard had sound tactical reasons for killing his prisoners, and even tried another alternative first. In addition, this was kind of bad history. The historian left out facts that actually support his position that Richard's act was a war crime - that Richard (after waiting a month) reportedly ordered the executions out of anger, and that the prisoners weren't all soldiers, but included women and children ...The crusades were a shameful enough episode in Christian history that we really don't need this sort of obvious propaganda being presented as history.",3,"Superficial, but interesting.
