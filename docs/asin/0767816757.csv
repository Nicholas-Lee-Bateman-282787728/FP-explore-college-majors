12866,A1VP9BGUZA29YG,0767816757,Aaron Tom,"[15, 19]","SAVIOR is one of the most brutal, disturbing films I have ever witnessed, and certainly one of the best films of the year.  It is about hope in the  face of war, but it is never uplifting.  Instead, it forces some of the  imagery inside your head with some of the most brutal and uncompromising  scenes since SCHINDLER'S LIST.  The plot concerns a man named Joshua Rose  (perfectly played by Dennis Quaid), whose wife and child are killed moments  after he sees them.  Hearing that Muslims may be involved, he goes to the  nearest Mosque and opens fire on the innocent people praying inside.  To  escape his crime, he joins the Foreign Legion, overseas.  This is where he  meets Vera, a woman pregnant with her rapist's child.  Rose (who goes under  the name of Guy in the Legion) saves her from certain doom, and takes her  under his wing.  Together, they try to escape the cruelties of war, and  perhaps to start a new life.  I think everything about this movie is first  rate, from the stunning cinematography, to the soundtrack, and to the  excellent performances (especially by Quaid and Natasa Ninkovic as Vera).  This movie is definately highly recommended.  If it does nothing else for  you, it will at least open your eyes to the horror and ultimate  pointlessness of the war going on in Bosnia.A little side note: Oliver  Stone serves as executive producer.",5,One of the Most Disturbing Films of All Time,965260800,"08 3, 2000",2000,1367,"['SAVIOR', 'one', 'most', 'brutal', 'disturbing', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'witnessed', 'certainly', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'year', 'hope', 'face', 'war', 'never', 'uplifting', 'Instead', 'imagery', 'head', 'most', 'brutal', 'uncompromising', 'scenes', 'SCHINDLER', 'LIST', 'plot', 'man', 'named', 'Joshua', 'Rose', 'perfectly', 'played', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'wife', 'child', 'are', 'killed', 'moments', 'Hearing', 'Muslims', 'may', 'be', 'involved', 'nearest', 'Mosque', 'fire', 'innocent', 'people', 'praying', 'inside', 'escape', 'crime', 'Foreign', 'Legion', 'overseas', 'where', 'Vera', 'woman', 'pregnant', 'rapist', 'child', 'Rose', 'who', 'name', 'Guy', 'Legion', 'certain', 'doom', 'wing', 'Together', 'try', 'escape', 'cruelties', 'war', 'perhaps', 'start', 'new', 'life', 'think', 'everything', 'movie', 'first', 'rate', 'stunning', 'cinematography', 'soundtrack', 'excellent', 'performances', 'especially', 'Quaid', 'Natasa', 'Ninkovic', 'Vera', 'movie', 'definately', 'highly', 'recommended', 'nothing', 'else', 'will', 'least', 'open', 'eyes', 'horror', 'ultimate', 'pointlessness', 'war', 'going', 'Bosnia.A', 'little', 'side', 'note', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'executive', 'producer']",N/A

I had not seen Dennis Quaid do any really good acting in years, except for Stone in &quot;Any Given Sunday&quot; but it was just a supporting role. This is certainly the best work Quaid has done as a leading man since &quot;The Big Easy&quot; but it could not be a more different role for him. Essentially, Quaid plays a man who has been shaped into being a war machine.  He is pretty much dead in every other sense and the loss of his family in a bombing and his own violent response to that loss have shaped him into who he is now.  The opportunity to leave that deadened state arrives when Quaid delivers a baby and then tries to get the baby and its mother to the Red Cross.  This is all set against the Serbian-Bosnian war, which is about as pointless a war to an outsider as any war could be.  The land itself is filled with lovely vistas, breathtaking views and has to be the most horrible place in the world to live.  If you were to send a postcard, it would read, &quot;Absolutely gorgeous, absolutely horrible.&quot;  Quaid gives the performance of his life here with an excellent screenplay, director, cinematographer and supporting actors behind him every step of the way.  I can't believe he has spent all these years playing these wolfish bachelor types when he had this kind of talent.  There is one misleading aspect to this film though.  Nastassja Kinski is only onscreen for the first five minutes of the movie.

Dennis Quaid is excellent in his role of Joshua Rose, an American mercenary involved in the Bosnian War.  After losing his family to Islamist terrorism, he goes on a murderous rampage at a nearby mosque.  He escapes justice by joining the French Foreign Legion, and continues his personal vendetta against Moslems in war-divided Yugoslavia.  When &quot;Guy&quot; takes on the protection of a Serb girl, pregnant by her Muslim captors, he begins to realize there are no clearcut villains or victims in this conflict; only enduring ethnic hatreds which run bone-deep.  The girl and her baby are equally abused by bigoted Serbs as by vengeful Muslims.  The young mother is callously ambivalent about her mixed-blood child of rape, and for one heart-stopping moment, comes close to murdering it herself.  In his mission to save the innocent infant, the mercenary overcomes some of his own hatred.

The horrors of ethnic cleansing are seen up close and personal.  I found myself often wishing to look away from the screen.  Dennis Quaid plays the part of a moral monster and war criminal who is provided a fateful chance for limited redemption.  He is an American French Foreign Legionnaire who comes across a young Bosnian Serbian woman (Natasa Ninkovic) about to give birth to her Muslim rapist's daughter.  She is not perceived as a victim by her family, but a disgusting whore who should have preferred suicide.  The story primarily revolves around Quaid's attempt to save their lives.Director Peter Antonijevic pulls no punches in depicting a high number of these Bosnian inhabitants as reactionary and cruel to each other.  The values of pluralism, mercy, and forgiveness are seemingly alien concepts.  I totally agree with Antonijevic's decision to avoid the alleged political reasons for this insanity.  There are no rational or moral justifications for these crimes against humanity.  To focus on the political underpinnings of the Balkan conflicts is to do an injustice to the victims.  The perpetrators simply used them as petty rationalizations.This is not a great film.  It needed to be a edited down by around ten minutes to provide it with a quicker pace.  My guess is that the finances didn't permit Director Antonijevic sufficient time and resources to fine tune his creation.  The acting, though, is superb and many of the scenes dramatically riveting, andunforgettable.  Both Quaid and Ninkovic would have certainly garnered major acting ward nominations had Savior been a huge financial success.  I strongly encourage anyone who is at least a teenager to view this movie at least once in their life. If nothing else, it should encourage you to actively seek ways of preventing future instances of genocide.",4,Savior is not for the faint of heart,1019260800,"04 20, 2002",2002,1884,"['may', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'violent', 'movies', 'time', 'horrors', 'ethnic', 'cleansing', 'are', 'seen', 'up', 'close', 'personal', 'found', 'often', 'wishing', 'look', 'away', 'screen', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'part', 'moral', 'monster', 'war', 'criminal', 'who', 'provided', 'fateful', 'chance', 'limited', 'redemption', 'American', 'French', 'Foreign', 'Legionnaire', 'who', 'young', 'Bosnian', 'Serbian', 'woman', 'Natasa', 'Ninkovic', 'give', 'birth', 'Muslim', 'rapist', 'daughter', 'not', 'perceived', 'victim', 'family', 'disgusting', 'whore', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'preferred', 'suicide', 'story', 'primarily', 'around', 'Quaid', 'attempt', 'save', 'lives.Director', 'Peter', 'Antonijevic', 'punches', 'depicting', 'high', 'number', 'Bosnian', 'inhabitants', 'reactionary', 'cruel', 'other', 'values', 'pluralism', 'mercy', 'forgiveness', 'are', 'seemingly', 'alien', 'concepts', 'totally', 'agree', 'Antonijevic', 'decision', 'avoid', 'alleged', 'political', 'reasons', 'insanity', 'are', 'rational', 'moral', 'justifications', 'crimes', 'humanity', 'focus', 'political', 'underpinnings', 'Balkan', 'conflicts', 'do', 'injustice', 'victims', 'perpetrators', 'simply', 'used', 'petty', 'rationalizations.This', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'needed', 'be', 'edited', 'down', 'ten', 'minutes', 'provide', 'quicker', 'pace', 'guess', 'finances', 'did', ""n't"", 'permit', 'Director', 'Antonijevic', 'sufficient', 'time', 'resources', 'fine', 'tune', 'creation', 'acting', 'superb', 'many', 'scenes', 'dramatically', 'riveting', 'andunforgettable', 'Quaid', 'Ninkovic', 'would', 'have', 'certainly', 'garnered', 'major', 'acting', 'ward', 'nominations', 'had', 'Savior', 'been', 'huge', 'financial', 'success', 'strongly', 'encourage', 'anyone', 'who', 'least', 'teenager', 'view', 'movie', 'least', 'once', 'life', 'nothing', 'else', 'should', 'encourage', 'actively', 'seek', 'ways', 'preventing', 'future', 'instances', 'genocide']",N/A
12872,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,0767816757,Doug Park,"[0, 0]","SAVIOR is one of the most truly disturbing films that I have ever seen. It fully conveys the horror and complexity of the Bosnian wars, yet it does so without  ever degenerating into a war-horror fest. Don't get me wrong: There's plenty of gore and violence here, along with brutally realistic mass execution scenes. Nevertheless, it's all very ""earned."" Though SAVIOR wrenches the guts, it also touches the heart at the end.This is one of Quaid's finest performances as ""Guy""(fka Joshua Rose) a former U.S. Army officer who, for reasons the film reveals, finds himself fighting with the Bosnian Serbs for the simple reason that they are fighting (and killing) Moslems. He is given a painful reminder that all is not as it appears and finds himself the unwitting ""savior"" of the child of a young Serb woman raped by her Bosnian captors.SAVIOR skillfully avoids the usual oppressed vs. oppressor stereotypes. ""Guy"" Rose--along with just about everyone else in this film, most particularly the Serbian victim ""Vera,"" finely played by Natasa Ninkovic--has all the complexities of a real person in his situation. This film is an extraordinary multi-character study. It also includes a taut, well-developed storyline and immediate, breathtaking cinematography. Filmed mostly in Montenegro, right next door to  Bosnia, with a supporting cast that is largely Serb, Montenegrin, Bosnian, or Croatian, the film's setting is also, well, as real as it can possibly be. The soundtrack, composed of Serbo-Croatian hymns, ballads, and lullabies, does a beautiful job of setting mood and atmosphere.One tip: At least in America, the conflicts that arose in the former Yugoslavia during the '90s have faded from recent memory, and if you don't recall at least the basic facts behind these events, it might be helpful to read up a little on same before seeing SAVIOR.",5,A Remarkable Film,1359590400,"01 31, 2013",2013,1850,"['SAVIOR', 'one', 'most', 'truly', 'disturbing', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'fully', 'horror', 'complexity', 'Bosnian', 'wars', 'so', 'ever', 'degenerating', 'war-horror', 'fest', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'plenty', 'gore', 'violence', 'here', 'brutally', 'realistic', 'mass', 'execution', 'scenes', 'Nevertheless', 'very', 'earned', 'SAVIOR', 'guts', 'also', 'heart', 'end.This', 'one', 'Quaid', 'finest', 'performances', 'Guy', 'fka', 'Joshua', 'Rose', 'former', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'officer', 'who', 'reasons', 'film', 'reveals', 'fighting', 'Bosnian', 'Serbs', 'simple', 'reason', 'are', 'fighting', 'killing', 'Moslems', 'given', 'painful', 'reminder', 'not', 'unwitting', 'savior', 'child', 'young', 'Serb', 'woman', 'raped', 'Bosnian', 'captors.SAVIOR', 'skillfully', 'usual', 'oppressed', 'vs.', 'oppressor', 'stereotypes', 'Guy', 'Rose', 'just', 'everyone', 'else', 'film', 'most', 'particularly', 'Serbian', 'victim', 'Vera', 'finely', 'played', 'Natasa', 'Ninkovic', 'complexities', 'real', 'person', 'situation', 'film', 'extraordinary', 'multi-character', 'study', 'also', 'taut', 'well-developed', 'storyline', 'immediate', 'breathtaking', 'cinematography', 'Filmed', 'mostly', 'Montenegro', 'right', 'next', 'door', 'Bosnia', 'supporting', 'cast', 'largely', 'Serb', 'Montenegrin', 'Bosnian', 'Croatian', 'film', 'setting', 'also', 'well', 'as', 'real', 'can', 'possibly', 'be', 'soundtrack', 'composed', 'Serbo-Croatian', 'hymns', 'ballads', 'lullabies', 'beautiful', 'job', 'setting', 'mood', 'atmosphere.One', 'tip', 'least', 'America', 'conflicts', 'arose', 'former', 'Yugoslavia', ""'90s"", 'have', 'faded', 'recent', 'memory', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'least', 'basic', 'facts', 'events', 'might', 'be', 'helpful', 'read', 'up', 'little', 'same', 'seeing', 'SAVIOR']",N/A

It is about terrorists and the war in Bosnia, and in representing the insane brutality, this film doesn't waver and pulls no punches.  Much like &quot;Schindler's List&quot;, you'll sit horrified as this depressing film tells its shattering tale.  Here you have a hero that is a mass murderer and cold-blooded sniper for the Serbs -- a killer of men and even children.  That should tell you something right there.Dennis Quaid gives the performance of his life as Joshua Rose, a U.S. military officer stationed in France.  He needed to give such a performance because the subject matter deserves no less.  Matter-of-fact, the acting throughout is top-drawer.  Oddly, the beautiful Nastassja Kinski gets a top billing, but she really only has a cameo roll.  Especially haunting is Natasa Ninkovic in her roll as Vera, a victim of a Muslim rape and carrying an unwanted child.  Peter Antonijevic's direction (see Amazon's review) is steadfast in its relentless pursuit to lay before us the absolute cruelty of ethnic hatreds -- a war where there are no winners, only survivors whose twisted sense of honor leaves us shaking our heads in utter disdain and disbelief.If you are looking for an action drama with a hero to save the day, look somewhere else.  What you get here is heartbreaking reality....a glimpse of &quot;Hell on Earth&quot;, of wasted lives, of families being torn apart, and man's incomprehensible inhumanity.  This film could easily have been insufferable if it weren't for the thread of hope seeded in the birth of a bastard child.  As a viewer, I grasped at this small ray of sunshine as I watched Quaid's character slowly become more human.  But if you are seeking a happy ending, this isn't your film either.  Ultimately, you do have a sense of hope at the end, but it is fleeting at best.  And maybe that is as it should be.&quot;Savior&quot; must have come and gone very quickly, because I never heard about the film before.  That truly is a shame.

But this film portrays all sides of the Balkans conflict in a very unflattering light.  The real message of this film is not that Serbs are good and their opponents are bad; rather, it is that the Balkan conflict wasn't the simplistic bad, evil Serbs versus the poor, innocent Bosnian Muslims and Croats conflict that was portrayed in the Western news media.  The film is historically accurate in the sense that it makes clear that all sides, not just the Serbs, were guilty of war crimes against civilians.The movie starts out in Paris, where an American (Dennis Quaid) loses his wife and child to Muslim terrorists.  After he exacts revenge by taking the the law into his own hands, he flees to the French Foreign Legion under an assumed identity.  Seeking to fight for a cause he can believe in, he joins the Serbs fighting against Muslim Bosnians, only to be disillusioned after witnessing Serb brutality against Muslim civilians, and their wrath against a Serb woman whose only crime was to be raped and impregnated by a Muslim.  He tries to rescue the Serb woman and her child, and, along the way, witnesses massacres of Serb civilians first by Muslims and then by Croats.This is, more than anything, an anti-war movie, and it is much better than most other films about the Balkan conflict, which tend to come across as preachy, anti-Serb propaganda.One thing to note, however, is that while Nastassia Kinsky is given top billing as one of the films stars, she only appears in the film for about five minutes, as Dennis Quaid's wife, before she is killed off.",5,A Very Intense Anti-War Film,1098489600,"10 23, 2004",2004,1636,"['reviewers', 'have', 'criticized', 'film', 'allegedly', 'being', 'pro-Serb', 'film', 'sides', 'Balkans', 'conflict', 'very', 'unflattering', 'light', 'real', 'message', 'film', 'not', 'Serbs', 'are', 'good', 'opponents', 'are', 'bad', 'rather', 'Balkan', 'conflict', 'was', ""n't"", 'simplistic', 'bad', 'evil', 'Serbs', 'poor', 'innocent', 'Bosnian', 'Muslims', 'Croats', 'conflict', 'was', 'portrayed', 'Western', 'news', 'media', 'film', 'historically', 'accurate', 'sense', 'clear', 'sides', 'not', 'just', 'Serbs', 'were', 'guilty', 'war', 'crimes', 'civilians.The', 'movie', 'out', 'Paris', 'where', 'American', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'wife', 'child', 'Muslim', 'terrorists', 'revenge', 'taking', 'law', 'own', 'hands', 'French', 'Foreign', 'Legion', 'assumed', 'identity', 'Seeking', 'fight', 'cause', 'can', 'believe', 'Serbs', 'fighting', 'Muslim', 'Bosnians', 'only', 'be', 'disillusioned', 'witnessing', 'Serb', 'brutality', 'Muslim', 'civilians', 'wrath', 'Serb', 'woman', 'only', 'crime', 'was', 'be', 'raped', 'impregnated', 'Muslim', 'rescue', 'Serb', 'woman', 'child', 'way', 'massacres', 'Serb', 'civilians', 'first', 'Muslims', 'then', 'Croats.This', 'more', 'anything', 'anti-war', 'movie', 'much', 'better', 'most', 'other', 'films', 'Balkan', 'conflict', 'tend', 'come', 'preachy', 'anti-Serb', 'propaganda.One', 'thing', 'note', 'however', 'Nastassia', 'Kinsky', 'given', 'top', 'billing', 'one', 'films', 'stars', 'only', 'film', 'five', 'minutes', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'wife', 'killed', 'off']",N/A

Houzet ""wozamoya""","[18, 21]","This was one of the most emotionally gripping movies I have ever seen... this was a triumph for actor Dennis Quaid, a departure from his usual roles. Here he is the anti-hero, the guy whose pain and grief we understand but whose journey into darkness we shudder at.... This is NOT a Serbian propaganda piece, as some have suggested. To the contrary, the first monster we meet in this story (other than Quaid's mercenary) is a Serbian soldier who cuts off a Muslim grandmother's finger to take her ring and talks casually about the Muslim women he has raped in prison camps. But the atrocities are not limited to the Serbs.We first encounter Quaid's character, Joshua Rose, as a US military officer based in Paris. His wife and young son are killed in a bomb blast at a cafe opposite a US consular building. Rose's rage and vengeance is immediately directed at the nearest mosque, where he goes in and starts shooting Muslim worshipers in the back. Several people [have] called these worshipers ""innocent,"" but that might be a misnomer because at least one of the Muslims drew his own handgun ...Anyway, Rose is encouraged by his friend (played by Stellan Skarsgaard) to flee arrest. They join the Foreign Legion, take on new identities and fight in wars in various countries. But Rose is just marking time. He wants a war he can believe in. This interlude was meant to show a passage of time and how long Rose has held onto his resentment, but it is too hurried to have that effect.Rose and his friend end up in the former Yugoslavia, fighting on the side of the Serbs. Rose is trained as a sniper and we see him waiting for targets with relentless patience. Anyone is a target... His new partner is a Serb, hardened by war and without compassion. His partner's brutality toward a young Serbian woman pregnant by a Muslim rapist (like it was her fault!) finally causes Rose to intervene on behalf of someone.He takes her to her home but her family rejects her and even pursues them both to exact punishment from some twisted sense of honor. From then on it's a desperate flight to get to a UN safe haven. Rose's long dead compassion is aroused for the woman's bastard child, and seeing him care for her baby awakens the mother out of her own numbness.Like others have said, this does not have a happy ending, but at least offers a glimmer of hope for souls to be redeemed and survivors to have a chance at life.",5,Painful but necessary glimpse of the war in Bosnia,1052870400,"05 14, 2003",2003,2411,"['was', 'one', 'most', 'emotionally', 'gripping', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'was', 'triumph', 'actor', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'departure', 'usual', 'roles', 'Here', 'anti-hero', 'guy', 'pain', 'grief', 'understand', 'journey', 'darkness', 'shudder', 'NOT', 'Serbian', 'propaganda', 'piece', 'have', 'suggested', 'contrary', 'first', 'monster', 'meet', 'story', 'other', 'Quaid', 'mercenary', 'Serbian', 'soldier', 'who', 'off', 'Muslim', 'grandmother', 'finger', 'take', 'ring', 'talks', 'casually', 'Muslim', 'women', 'raped', 'prison', 'camps', 'atrocities', 'are', 'not', 'limited', 'Serbs.We', 'first', 'encounter', 'Quaid', 'character', 'Joshua', 'Rose', 'US', 'military', 'officer', 'based', 'Paris', 'wife', 'young', 'son', 'are', 'killed', 'bomb', 'blast', 'cafe', 'opposite', 'US', 'consular', 'building', 'Rose', 'rage', 'vengeance', 'immediately', 'directed', 'nearest', 'mosque', 'where', 'starts', 'shooting', 'Muslim', 'worshipers', 'back', 'Several', 'people', '[', 'have', ']', 'called', 'worshipers', 'innocent', 'might', 'be', 'misnomer', 'least', 'one', 'Muslims', 'drew', 'own', 'handgun', 'Anyway', 'Rose', 'encouraged', 'friend', 'played', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgaard', 'flee', 'arrest', 'join', 'Foreign', 'Legion', 'take', 'new', 'identities', 'fight', 'wars', 'various', 'countries', 'Rose', 'just', 'marking', 'time', 'war', 'can', 'believe', 'interlude', 'was', 'meant', 'show', 'passage', 'time', 'how', 'long', 'Rose', 'held', 'resentment', 'too', 'hurried', 'have', 'effect.Rose', 'friend', 'end', 'up', 'former', 'Yugoslavia', 'fighting', 'side', 'Serbs', 'Rose', 'trained', 'sniper', 'see', 'waiting', 'targets', 'relentless', 'patience', 'Anyone', 'target', 'new', 'partner', 'Serb', 'hardened', 'war', 'compassion', 'partner', 'brutality', 'young', 'Serbian', 'woman', 'pregnant', 'Muslim', 'rapist', 'was', 'fault', 'finally', 'Rose', 'intervene', 'behalf', 'someone.He', 'home', 'family', 'even', 'pursues', 'exact', 'punishment', 'twisted', 'sense', 'honor', 'then', 'desperate', 'flight', 'get', 'UN', 'safe', 'haven', 'Rose', 'long', 'dead', 'compassion', 'aroused', 'woman', 'bastard', 'child', 'seeing', 'care', 'baby', 'mother', 'own', 'numbness.Like', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'not', 'have', 'happy', 'ending', 'least', 'offers', 'glimmer', 'hope', 'souls', 'be', 'redeemed', 'survivors', 'have', 'chance', 'life']",N/A

12891,A1IA5XQQ9QBN63,0767816757,Mariusz Zydyk,"[7, 13]","I guess whenever there's a movie on the war in Bosnia, there will be accusations of propaganda, skewing facts, rewriting history, biases, and so forth. As an aside, I do have to say that Savior comes out on the Serbian side, with Muslims being the definite bad guys here. (If you're looking for a relatively middle of the road view, see No Man's Land.) But that is none of my concern here.I understand the movie was made on a budget (as seems clear from the director's commentary), but that is no excuse for its many shortcomings.First, the good stuff.It looks great. Great location, nice colours, and it sounds good to boot. Good production.The action/fight scenes are very well done, not overdone in the ever so popular action movie style, but they don't look cheap and cheesy, just natural and realistic. Violence is well measured, purposeful (within the movie and plot) and has realistic results and consequences.Camera work is good too, the close ups from Quaid's PoV work especially well. It's almost like being there :)Finally, before I forget, the meat of the plot and Quaid's character are quite good.But could have been worked better.The opening scenes (developed as almost a separate sub-movie) introduce us to Quaid's character. Then he's off to Foreign Legion boot camp, and does a couple of missions, which presumably make him a hardened veteran. Really, they're just confusing. Too short to matter and to absorb. Suddenly we're in Bosnia looking through a sniper's scope. Aside from the opening scenes, we're left to assume Quaid's a tortured, restless, numb soul. He must be, because the director says so. Listening to the director's commentary track, you have to laugh out loud at times, because what he's describing and what you're seeing are almost total opposites. And I don't think it's a language barrier.The director also keeps blaming the 'financiers' for many things. They wanted this, and that, didn't like this, etc, etc. Please...The dialogue is very stiff, very forced and unnatural. Good thing the kid gets off-screen early; he's your typical Hollywood portrayal of a child, asking all these insightful adult questions, like 'is god in bad people too?' Adults don't fare much better, delivering disjoint, wooden lines every couple of minutes. And what's with those voices? Sure is a lot of grunting going around. Goran is just about the only guy with any soul showing in the movie.That's my biggest beef here. It's almost painful to sit through the thing sometimes, you just gotta cringe and bear it for a few more minutes.Which brings me to the last point. I don't see this as a difficult movie, or tough, or rough, or challanging, or any of that. Some reviewer said that the slight glimmer of hope with the baby was the only thing that made it worthwhile. Personally, I thought the movie took the easy way out several times, the major one being the baby plot. Just a little too wishy-washy Hollywoody happy ending style. There are a couple of scenes that will make your average American movie goer wince and oooh, and aww (out of social responsibility mostly), but nothing a seasoned war movie veteran hasn't seen before in more brutal detail.Really, if the director intended for us to see Quaid's stuggle with himself, his humanity, his search for hope, it should have been more subtle, using plot points like the baby as mere devices, means to an end, not bludgeon viewers over the head to make sure they don't miss the obvious. And the director clearly indicates, time and time again, that this is a character study. Well, if it is, how come there's so little character?2/5.

Dennis Quaid is a Foreign Legion soldier who detests Islam and Muslims.  He dons the Serbian Guard uniform in the Bosnian conflict, fighting against the Bosniaks.Raised in a foreign culture, Guy (Quaid) is taken aback by the cruelty of the locals, either towards other nationalities, or even towards their own.  Guy is placed in a situation in which he has to decide between his military training and objectiveness (as far as the side he chose to fight for is concerned) and his own moral objections.The movie is good in that it shows the viewer all three sides as committing crimes against humanity - not just the Serbs, but also Croats, as well as Bosniaks.  This is a refreshing change from many biased, and/or politically correct films on the subject.  Truth is that all the sides in the conflict committed atrocities that may baffle the Western mind, but which have been occuring and reocurring in the Balkans for centuries.I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a fair portrayal of the conflict in Bosnia(even if it is a fraction of it).

Paradoxically,  Peter Antonijevic does not seem to share this view. It is well-known that Serbians started the war in an attempt to annihilate all Muslims and create ""Great Serbia""- a state comprising of Serbians only! The director Peter Antonijevic deliberately misrepresents and distorts the facts. For instant, it has been documented that Serbians committed a large majority of the war crimes (including rapes) in Bosnia- check David Rohde for corroboration. Ironically, in this particular case the perpetrator ""happens"" to be a Muslim. This is an insidious move by the director to blind the viewer with hatred toward all Muslims. As was expected, this movie starts with an atrocious act committed by Muslim fundamentalists ( a very popular term in the Western media). The lead actor seeks to avenge the death of his wife and child and on that account joins the Serbian army, whose primary objective is to kill as many Muslims as possible. Clearly, Antonijevic tries to malign Bosnian Muslims but this is not strange considering the fact that Antonijevic is a Serbian. It is evident that he is subjective and this seriously undermines the overall impression  of the movie. Peter Antonijevic appears to be oblivious to the following facts: of the 300.000 victims of the Bosnian war- 85% were Muslims, check David Rohde and others for corroboration. Admittedly, he fails to realize that Serbians were the aggressors whereas Muslims were victims of the gruesome genocide. This is a fact of life. Thus, with this movie, the director reveals that he loathes Muslims. In short, the purpose of this movie is solely to convince its viewers that all Muslims are evil and barbaric.

12898,A27A3AZA7L12N6,0767816757,Stephen M. Bauer,"[4, 11]","Bosnia, Kosovo, Serbia and Croatia-I think to most Americans it's all a blur.  Based on news reports of American's knowledge of geography, most of us couldn't find any of them on a map.  Despite all the news reports in recent years, I doubt most Americans could name the capital of Yugoslavia or its current head of state.  The movie Savior is based on a true story an American who became a mercenary in the Bosnian conflict, on the side of the Serbs.Joshua, played by Dennis Quaid, is an American Military Official living in Paris with his wife and infant son.  When war breaks out in Bosnia, he informs them that he has to leave to go to Bosnia as an observer.  Before he leaves, his wife and son are killed by Moslem terrorists when the caf&eacute; they are sitting in is blown to bits by a bomb.  In a state of rage, Joshua runs into the nearest Mosque and pumps several bullets into the back of a man who is kneeling in prayer.Joshua escapes to join the French Foreign Legion, where he is given a new name.  He then joins the Serbian army, circa 1993.  As a soldier, he is a perfectly efficient killing machine.  He follows orders and kills without emotion.  After a truce is declared, a young boy chasing a ball obliviously approaches a demarcation line.  Joshua tracks him through the scope of his sniper's rifle.  When the boy crosses the line, Joshua coolly executes him.  In the next scene, a young, pretty girl crosses the same line, in another spot, where Joshua's buddy is on guard duty.  He reacts to the girl like a normal human being.  She casually blows him away with a hand grenade.As a result of the murder of his wife and child, Joshua is dead inside, but he has found a place for himself in the Serbian army, in the war zone in Bosnia.Unfortunately, up to this point in the movie, my feeling was that this was just another senseless, action/violence thriller, but it was just sufficiently different to keep me going.Joshua gets assigned to escort duty in a prisoner exchange with Moslems.  One of the prisoners he receives is a young, civilian Serbian woman named Vera, played by Nastassjia Kinski.  She is pregnant as a result of being raped and is close to giving birth.  She appears traumatized.  Joshua's job is to drive her back her family in her home village.  On the trip to her village, she gives birth almost right away.  She is totally indifferent to the baby and does not respond to it or care for it in any way.  She is as indifferent as to the baby as Joshua is to killing children.  They are both emotional basket cases.But this is when Joshua starts to change.  With a woman and newborn baby in his care, he starts to show sign of humanity.  He tries everything he can to try and get Vera to care for the baby.  There is a language barrier.  She is practically catatonic towards the baby.  He continually urges, pleads, annoys and harasses her to get her to care for the baby.  Eventually, he starts to make some progress; he gets her to breast feed the baby.  On part of the trip, they spend one night in the home of a couple where the husband is a Croat and the wife, a Serb.  They give them a bottle and diapers.  For a while they travel with a fellow Serbian soldier who is from Vera's village.  He hates Moslems and wants to kill the baby, since it is half Moslem, by blood.  Joshua executes him.  When Joshua and Vera get to her village, she is rejected by her father and told to leave the village because she is pregnant.There are no good guys in this movie.  Atrocities are committed by all sides.  The death of Joshua's family by Moslem terrorists and his joining the Serbian nationalist army to act out his desire for revenge is intended to be a personal microcosm about how the historical conflict started and carries on.  I'm not going to tell you who lives and who dies.The movie is worth seeing.  Although the movie is about what happens to Joshua, you get some idea of what the conflict has done to the people that live there and what their life is like.  By comparison, news reports and CNN seem to exist in the abstract.  In the movie you also get an idea of the medieval mentality (revenge killings, the shunning of women who have been raped) in the region.  Beware; the killing scenes will make you shudder.I like the fact that the Serbs are not singled out as the bad guys, anymore than anyone else.  The Croats are portrayed badly, but maybe this helps balance out the bad public image of the Serbs to give all parties in the movie the proper balance.In her role as Vera, Natassja Kinski appears extremely unattractive, as you would expect from a character who has been imprisoned and gang raped.  As the movie goes on she starts to appear more attractive.  I don't know if it's my imagination or if this was done by design.  She is an actress very comfortable in her own skin.No doubt, redemption and salvation are what the Serbian director wishes for Serbia.  However, Joshua's redemption is paltry and inadequate, and as a savior, he is a dismal failure.",3,"Violence, Revenge, then Redemption",1026604800,"07 14, 2002",2002,5014,"['Bosnia', 'Kosovo', 'Serbia', 'Croatia-I', 'think', 'most', 'Americans', 'blur', 'Based', 'news', 'reports', 'American', 'knowledge', 'geography', 'most', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'map', 'news', 'reports', 'recent', 'years', 'doubt', 'most', 'Americans', 'could', 'name', 'capital', 'Yugoslavia', 'current', 'head', 'state', 'movie', 'Savior', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'American', 'who', 'became', 'mercenary', 'Bosnian', 'conflict', 'side', 'Serbs.Joshua', 'played', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'American', 'Military', 'Official', 'living', 'Paris', 'wife', 'infant', 'son', 'When', 'war', 'out', 'Bosnia', 'leave', 'go', 'Bosnia', 'observer', 'wife', 'son', 'are', 'killed', 'Moslem', 'terrorists', 'when', 'caf', 'eacute', 'are', 'sitting', 'blown', 'bits', 'bomb', 'state', 'rage', 'Joshua', 'nearest', 'Mosque', 'pumps', 'several', 'bullets', 'back', 'man', 'who', 'kneeling', 'prayer.Joshua', 'escapes', 'join', 'French', 'Foreign', 'Legion', 'where', 'given', 'new', 'name', 'then', 'Serbian', 'army', 'circa', '1993', 'soldier', 'perfectly', 'efficient', 'killing', 'machine', 'orders', 'kills', 'emotion', 'truce', 'declared', 'young', 'boy', 'chasing', 'ball', 'obliviously', 'demarcation', 'line', 'Joshua', 'scope', 'sniper', 'rifle', 'When', 'boy', 'line', 'Joshua', 'coolly', 'next', 'scene', 'young', 'pretty', 'girl', 'same', 'line', 'spot', 'where', 'Joshua', 'buddy', 'guard', 'duty', 'girl', 'normal', 'human', 'being', 'casually', 'away', 'hand', 'grenade.As', 'result', 'murder', 'wife', 'child', 'Joshua', 'dead', 'inside', 'found', 'place', 'Serbian', 'army', 'war', 'zone', 'Bosnia.Unfortunately', 'up', 'point', 'movie', 'feeling', 'was', 'was', 'just', 'senseless', 'action/violence', 'thriller', 'was', 'just', 'sufficiently', 'different', 'keep', 'going.Joshua', 'assigned', 'escort', 'duty', 'prisoner', 'exchange', 'Moslems', 'One', 'prisoners', 'young', 'civilian', 'Serbian', 'woman', 'named', 'Vera', 'played', 'Nastassjia', 'Kinski', 'pregnant', 'result', 'being', 'raped', 'close', 'giving', 'birth', 'traumatized', 'Joshua', 'job', 'drive', 'back', 'family', 'home', 'village', 'trip', 'village', 'birth', 'almost', 'right', 'away', 'totally', 'indifferent', 'baby', 'not', 'respond', 'care', 'way', 'as', 'indifferent', 'baby', 'Joshua', 'killing', 'children', 'are', 'emotional', 'basket', 'cases.But', 'when', 'Joshua', 'change', 'woman', 'newborn', 'baby', 'care', 'show', 'sign', 'humanity', 'everything', 'can', 'try', 'get', 'Vera', 'care', 'baby', 'language', 'barrier', 'practically', 'catatonic', 'baby', 'continually', 'pleads', 'annoys', 'get', 'care', 'baby', 'Eventually', 'make', 'progress', 'breast', 'feed', 'baby', 'part', 'trip', 'spend', 'one', 'night', 'home', 'couple', 'where', 'husband', 'Croat', 'wife', 'Serb', 'give', 'bottle', 'diapers', 'while', 'travel', 'fellow', 'Serbian', 'soldier', 'who', 'Vera', 'village', 'Moslems', 'kill', 'baby', 'half', 'Moslem', 'blood', 'Joshua', 'When', 'Joshua', 'Vera', 'get', 'village', 'rejected', 'father', 'told', 'leave', 'village', 'pregnant.There', 'are', 'good', 'guys', 'movie', 'Atrocities', 'are', 'committed', 'sides', 'death', 'Joshua', 'family', 'Moslem', 'terrorists', 'joining', 'Serbian', 'nationalist', 'army', 'act', 'out', 'desire', 'revenge', 'intended', 'be', 'personal', 'microcosm', 'how', 'historical', 'conflict', 'started', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'tell', 'who', 'who', 'dies.The', 'movie', 'worth', 'seeing', 'movie', 'what', 'Joshua', 'get', 'idea', 'what', 'conflict', 'done', 'people', 'live', 'there', 'what', 'life', 'comparison', 'news', 'reports', 'CNN', 'seem', 'exist', 'abstract', 'movie', 'also', 'get', 'idea', 'medieval', 'mentality', 'revenge', 'killings', 'shunning', 'women', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'raped', 'region', 'Beware', 'killing', 'scenes', 'will', 'make', 'shudder.I', 'fact', 'Serbs', 'are', 'not', 'singled', 'out', 'bad', 'guys', 'anymore', 'anyone', 'else', 'Croats', 'are', 'portrayed', 'badly', 'maybe', 'balance', 'out', 'bad', 'public', 'image', 'Serbs', 'give', 'parties', 'movie', 'proper', 'balance.In', 'role', 'Vera', 'Natassja', 'Kinski', 'extremely', 'unattractive', 'would', 'expect', 'character', 'who', 'been', 'imprisoned', 'gang', 'raped', 'movie', 'appear', 'more', 'attractive', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'imagination', 'was', 'done', 'design', 'actress', 'very', 'comfortable', 'own', 'skin.No', 'doubt', 'redemption', 'salvation', 'are', 'what', 'Serbian', 'director', 'wishes', 'Serbia', 'However', 'Joshua', 'redemption', 'paltry', 'inadequate', 'savior', 'dismal', 'failure']",N/A

Dennis Quaid plays a hardened veteran of the French Foreign Legion with a past that still haunts him.  His numb mind moving from conflict to conflict until his best friend is killed and he has nothing left.But there is still a glimmer of a soft side in him and he saves a woman who has become another emotionally wasted character in this stark movie.Together they move through Bosnia as the movie shows the stark reality that is war in a homeland.  This movie is graphic at times and should not be watched by the meek of heart.  It portrays the battle scenes of a war as seen through soldiers, snipers and civilians.  It's hard to tell who are the real victims.This movie is very good and is one of Dennis Quaid's most powerful perfomances.

Civilization becomming zombies to ethnic cleansing...it continues to happen right before our eyes.Dennis Quaid does an EXCELLENT job as an American soldier who witnesses the murder of his wife and son, while in Paris, by terrorists. He reacts the way most people react, with anger and revenge on his mind. This lands him in the Foreign Legion where he continues to kill in anger as a mercenary for the Serbs. He plays the part of a heartless killer, backed by an army, with great conviction.Natasa Ninkovic plays a Serbian woman who is pregnant by a Muslim rapist. She suffers the fate of many women during war, persecution for something that is not her fault. She is beaten because she carries a Muslim child, disowned and stalked by her family for dishonor and walking through life unsure if she even wants to live. Who would? After giving birth because of the beating she becomes distant and withdrawn only surviving by the protection of Dennis Quaid who comes to her aid and wakes up from his own death trance. The scenes with the baby will rip your heart to pieces, especially when you imagine the reality behind it all. Children are born into this hateful nonsense everyday.This movie is an excellent saga that brings the truth behind hatred to a head. War kills and creates killers out of people who once were only men. It changes societies into cleansing grounds and forgets the individual heart. This war of the Muslims against the Serbs was mostly ignored in America but it was yet another genocide that needs to be remembered and addressed. The director Peter Antonijevic pulls no punches in dealing with the atrocity head on. Bravo to this film....but shame on acts of war!",5,The Clash of Humanity and War,1086220800,"06 3, 2004",2004,1751,"['movie', 'life', 'horror', 'what', 'war', 'really', 'about', 'Civilization', 'becomming', 'zombies', 'ethnic', 'cleansing', 'happen', 'right', 'eyes.Dennis', 'Quaid', 'EXCELLENT', 'job', 'American', 'soldier', 'who', 'murder', 'wife', 'son', 'Paris', 'terrorists', 'way', 'most', 'people', 'react', 'anger', 'revenge', 'mind', 'Foreign', 'Legion', 'where', 'kill', 'anger', 'mercenary', 'Serbs', 'part', 'heartless', 'killer', 'backed', 'army', 'great', 'conviction.Natasa', 'Ninkovic', 'Serbian', 'woman', 'who', 'pregnant', 'Muslim', 'rapist', 'fate', 'many', 'women', 'war', 'persecution', 'something', 'not', 'fault', 'beaten', 'Muslim', 'child', 'disowned', 'stalked', 'family', 'dishonor', 'walking', 'life', 'unsure', 'even', 'live', 'Who', 'would', 'giving', 'birth', 'beating', 'distant', 'only', 'surviving', 'protection', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'who', 'aid', 'up', 'own', 'death', 'trance', 'scenes', 'baby', 'will', 'rip', 'heart', 'pieces', 'especially', 'when', 'imagine', 'reality', 'Children', 'are', 'born', 'hateful', 'nonsense', 'everyday.This', 'movie', 'excellent', 'saga', 'truth', 'hatred', 'head', 'War', 'kills', 'killers', 'people', 'who', 'once', 'were', 'only', 'men', 'societies', 'cleansing', 'grounds', 'individual', 'heart', 'war', 'Muslims', 'Serbs', 'was', 'mostly', 'ignored', 'America', 'was', 'yet', 'genocide', 'be', 'remembered', 'addressed', 'director', 'Peter', 'Antonijevic', 'punches', 'dealing', 'atrocity', 'head', 'Bravo', 'film', '.but', 'shame', 'acts', 'war']",N/A
12903,A3N5XIM9R2OQH0,0767816757,Wheelchair Assassin,"[2, 4]","While it's certainly nothing new for movies to deal with violent cultural and ethnic clashes, &quot;Savior&quot; is still worth seeing because it examines such strife on a more personal level than most.  In a radical departure from his norm, Dennis Quaid plays a hardened, morally grey character in a challenging and unsettling film.  The movie lets you know right away what you're in for: Quaid's Joshua Rose, an American living in Paris in 1987, loses his family in a bombing by Muslim fundamentalists, and quicky strolls to the nearest Mosque and coolly guns down a bunch of unsuspecting worshippers.  This scene raises a difficult question: it's easy to sympathize with Joshua's grief, but is he really any better the people who killed his family?  After all, he's just killed unsuspecting civilians himself.  The movie's opening sets the stage for an examination of an all-too-common theme of modern conflict: each side uses the atrocities of the other side to justify their own.  Unfortunately, the innocent have been fair game in such conflicts for years, a fact this movie vividly brings home.From there, things only get worse as Joshua becomes a mercenary fighting with Serbs and is plunged into the hellish moral vacuum that used to be called Yugoslavia.  Anyone who's familiar with this area's history knows that ethnic hatred there runs so deep it makes America's racial problems look like a junior-high shouting match, and the movie depicts the fruits of this hatred with unflinching vividness.  Joshua guns down a boy looking for his goat, his comrade Goran cuts off an old woman's finger and steals the ring from it, and the Bosnian Muslim fighters (and their Muhajadeen allies) do plenty of underhanded stuff themselves.The viewer gets to see firsthand the physical and emotional desolation left by war, where noncombatants have their lives touched whether they want them to be or not.Eventually Joshua tires of the relentless brutality and decides to take charge of a young Serb woman named Vera and her baby (the product of Vera's rape by a Muslim).  The start of the movie sees Joshua transforming from a loving family man to a heartless killer, but as he develops an attachment to Vera and her baby we see his soul steadily coming back by degrees as he tries to recover what he lost years ago.Along the way there are some more depictions of war-related horror, none more brutal than one late-movie scene that I won't get into the specifics of.  Suffice to say, you have to see it for yourself to believe the depths to which people can sink in the name of tribal hatred.  The movie does provide some uplift amid all the depression and violence, but much like &quot;Platoon,&quot; it will still leave some nagging questions in its wake.  Perhaps most disturbing are the implications for our own country.  As immigration increases and American society become less uniform and more segmented, are we heading down the same path as Yugoslavia?  Let's hope not.",4,Sobering,1074384000,"01 18, 2004",2004,2974,"['certainly', 'nothing', 'new', 'movies', 'deal', 'violent', 'cultural', 'ethnic', 'clashes', 'quot', 'Savior', 'quot', 'still', 'worth', 'seeing', 'such', 'strife', 'more', 'personal', 'level', 'most', 'radical', 'departure', 'norm', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'hardened', 'morally', 'grey', 'character', 'challenging', 'unsettling', 'film', 'movie', 'know', 'right', 'away', 'what', ""'re"", 'Quaid', 'Joshua', 'Rose', 'American', 'living', 'Paris', '1987', 'family', 'bombing', 'Muslim', 'fundamentalists', 'quicky', 'strolls', 'nearest', 'Mosque', 'coolly', 'guns', 'down', 'bunch', 'unsuspecting', 'worshippers', 'scene', 'difficult', 'question', 'easy', 'sympathize', 'Joshua', 'grief', 'really', 'better', 'people', 'who', 'killed', 'family', 'just', 'killed', 'unsuspecting', 'civilians', 'movie', 'opening', 'stage', 'examination', 'all-too-common', 'theme', 'modern', 'conflict', 'side', 'atrocities', 'other', 'side', 'justify', 'own', 'Unfortunately', 'innocent', 'have', 'been', 'fair', 'game', 'such', 'conflicts', 'years', 'fact', 'movie', 'vividly', 'home.From', 'there', 'things', 'only', 'get', 'worse', 'Joshua', 'mercenary', 'fighting', 'Serbs', 'plunged', 'hellish', 'moral', 'vacuum', 'used', 'be', 'called', 'Yugoslavia', 'Anyone', 'who', 'familiar', 'area', 'history', 'ethnic', 'hatred', 'so', 'deep', 'America', 'racial', 'problems', 'look', 'junior-high', 'shouting', 'match', 'movie', 'fruits', 'hatred', 'unflinching', 'vividness', 'Joshua', 'down', 'boy', 'looking', 'goat', 'comrade', 'Goran', 'off', 'old', 'woman', 'finger', 'ring', 'Bosnian', 'Muslim', 'fighters', 'Muhajadeen', 'allies', 'do', 'plenty', 'underhanded', 'stuff', 'themselves.The', 'viewer', 'see', 'firsthand', 'physical', 'emotional', 'desolation', 'left', 'war', 'where', 'noncombatants', 'have', 'lives', 'touched', 'want', 'be', 'not.Eventually', 'Joshua', 'tires', 'relentless', 'brutality', 'take', 'charge', 'young', 'Serb', 'woman', 'named', 'Vera', 'baby', 'product', 'Vera', 'rape', 'Muslim', 'start', 'movie', 'Joshua', 'transforming', 'loving', 'family', 'man', 'heartless', 'killer', 'attachment', 'Vera', 'baby', 'see', 'soul', 'steadily', 'coming', 'back', 'degrees', 'recover', 'what', 'lost', 'years', 'way', 'are', 'more', 'depictions', 'war-related', 'horror', 'none', 'more', 'brutal', 'one', 'late-movie', 'scene', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'specifics', 'Suffice', 'say', 'have', 'see', 'believe', 'depths', 'people', 'can', 'sink', 'name', 'tribal', 'hatred', 'movie', 'provide', 'uplift', 'depression', 'violence', 'much', 'quot', 'Platoon', 'quot', 'will', 'still', 'leave', 'nagging', 'questions', 'wake', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'disturbing', 'are', 'implications', 'own', 'country', 'immigration', 'increases', 'American', 'society', 'become', 'less', 'uniform', 'more', 'segmented', 'are', 'heading', 'down', 'same', 'path', 'Yugoslavia', 'Let', 'hope', 'not']",N/A
