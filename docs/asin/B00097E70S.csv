902626,A21279TEPJ8YJ9,B00097E70S,"Diaspora Chic ""diaspora_chic""","[14, 16]","Rokhaya Niang beautifully stands out as Mati, ""Madame Brouette"", a Muslim raised divorcee with a young daughter. She sells her wares in a wheelbarrow while looking out for the women in her village. She isn't afraid to speak her mind. She helps her friend Ndaxt get out of her abusive marriage. They live with Mati's father who doesn't believe in divorce. Mati doesn't conform to the tradition of a woman being a wife and mother alone. She values her independence despite what everyone else thinks.She meets Naago, a morally corrupt cop while on the street with her wheelbarrow in tow. Naago takes an interest in the single mother and even befriends her daughter giving her money and Coca-Cola. She is at first not taken by him but on New Year's she finds herself falling in love with him. She doesn't know that he is involved with other women and is in debt to a pimp named London.Her father puts her out of the house when he learns that she is pregnant outside of the marriage. She goes to Naago for help and finds out that he isn't who he is but is yet willing to hang on to him until things take a turn for the worse.""Madame Brouette"" isn't a musical, although there is a chorus and the daughter sings about a partridge that wants to be free. The partridge is symbolic for personal freedom. Humans want to be free. Despite Mati's independence, she was expected to conform to subservient roles of women. Naago wasn't free from his debts. Naago's involvement in corruption prisoned him like the prisoners in jail. The tragedy of Mati and Naago has created a battle of the sexes and exposed the system for what it is.""Madame Brouette"" was an interesting movie to watch. I highly recommend it.",5,Independent Woman Seeks Companion Who'll Love and Honor Her,1158278400,"09 15, 2006",2006,1692,"['Rokhaya', 'Niang', 'beautifully', 'out', 'Mati', 'Madame', 'Brouette', 'Muslim', 'raised', 'divorcee', 'young', 'daughter', 'wares', 'wheelbarrow', 'looking', 'out', 'women', 'village', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'speak', 'mind', 'friend', 'Ndaxt', 'get', 'abusive', 'marriage', 'live', 'Mati', 'father', 'who', ""n't"", 'believe', 'divorce', 'Mati', ""n't"", 'conform', 'tradition', 'woman', 'being', 'wife', 'mother', 'alone', 'independence', 'what', 'everyone', 'else', 'thinks.She', 'meets', 'Naago', 'morally', 'corrupt', 'cop', 'street', 'wheelbarrow', 'tow', 'Naago', 'interest', 'single', 'mother', 'even', 'daughter', 'giving', 'money', 'Coca-Cola', 'first', 'not', 'taken', 'New', 'Year', 'falling', 'love', ""n't"", 'know', 'involved', 'other', 'women', 'debt', 'pimp', 'named', 'London.Her', 'father', 'out', 'house', 'when', 'pregnant', 'marriage', 'Naago', 'help', 'out', ""n't"", 'who', 'yet', 'willing', 'hang', 'things', 'take', 'turn', 'worse', 'Madame', 'Brouette', ""n't"", 'musical', 'chorus', 'daughter', 'sings', 'partridge', 'be', 'free', 'partridge', 'symbolic', 'personal', 'freedom', 'Humans', 'want', 'be', 'free', 'Mati', 'independence', 'was', 'expected', 'conform', 'subservient', 'roles', 'women', 'Naago', 'was', ""n't"", 'free', 'debts', 'Naago', 'involvement', 'corruption', 'prisoned', 'prisoners', 'jail', 'tragedy', 'Mati', 'Naago', 'created', 'battle', 'sexes', 'exposed', 'system', 'what', 'Madame', 'Brouette', 'was', 'interesting', 'movie', 'watch', 'highly', 'recommend']",Madame Brouette

This film is like many modern day thrillers by filmmakers like Spike Lee, John Singleton, and Steven Soderbergh-it simply takes place in Senegal.  Although there are certainly many undertones, and culture specific sub-themes that a western audience can't comprehend, this film flows beautifully.  The colorful scenes and lively music make this film a one of a kind experience.I won't repeat the plot line...but you need to see this film!",5,A colorful thriller of a different world.,1209945600,"05 5, 2008",2008,539,"['just', 'finished', 'watching', 'movie', 'West', 'African', 'Francophone', 'Cinema', 'class', 'pure', 'gold', 'film', 'many', 'modern', 'day', 'thrillers', 'filmmakers', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'John', 'Singleton', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh-it', 'simply', 'place', 'Senegal', 'are', 'certainly', 'many', 'undertones', 'culture', 'specific', 'sub-themes', 'western', 'audience', 'ca', ""n't"", 'comprehend', 'film', 'beautifully', 'colorful', 'scenes', 'lively', 'music', 'make', 'film', 'one', 'kind', 'experience.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'repeat', 'plot', 'line', 'need', 'see', 'film']",Madame Brouette
