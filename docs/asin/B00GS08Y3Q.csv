1680257,A1X1N1RHFIOCRF,B00GS08Y3Q,arthistoryguy,"[2, 3]","The Best Offer is a film at once unique in its ingredients but familiar in its recipe.  I don't know... like a ""hamburger"" made with the rarest and best meats.  (That's a terrible analogy, but there it is.)  The film is both a satisfying bit of entertainment and a spotty attempt to reach a bit deeper.  I enjoyed it while it lasted, but I don't have much extended praise to share.As an art collector, artist, art historian, and somewhat of a shut-in myself the film speaks to me on several superficial levels. I utterly adore the subject matter, I still find it deeply interesting, but that isn't quite enough. The parts seem to be greater than the sum.The world of buying, selling, and forging antiques has always been ripe for cinematic and literary imagination.  It's a great juxtaposition: beauty and malice. This film fits into that lineage as a relatively cerebral and mysterious fiction; that is not to say it's particularly intelligent or especially imaginative, despite its efforts to be both. Being cerebral -- that is, existing largely around the emotions and behaviors of the central characters, as opposed to blunt action -- can be just as dumb as an explosion or a car chase at every turn... minus the thrill and with the added peril of pretentiousness.Done well, cerebral narratives are the best sort. They move us, but what's more, they offer explanations as to why we are moved in the first place. Unfortunately this film comes up short. At its core it's a basic heist drama and it winds up latching itself too faithfully to that metric. It's dressed in a promising and dizzying array of stops, starts, and meandering explorations of human nature but those are all just dressing for the same story repeated a million times. It's never particularly pretentious, although some aspects of the film grate the sensibilities: e.g. the bizarrely intelligent little person in the bar who serves as overbearing metaphor and narrative parallel; or the wealthy onlookers ogling at Virgil Oldman's gloves which he wears to protect himself from germs (gloves aren't odd, people wear them... why pretend otherwise?); or the fact that Robert appears to have a really great location for his tinkering shop but never seems to do anything... etc. But rather than embrace the stilted qualities of the main character, become mired in the melodrama of its risky plot devices, or succumb to the oft-vapid setting of the art and antiques world, the film is self-deprecating and critical enough of such things to be both party and convincing critic at the same time.  At moments the film is about much more than art or selling it/obtaining it; it digs to the core of the human qualities that make great art so lasting and so financially valuable.  But then it doesn't endeavor to illuminate its own findings.  The film stops short, or it holds back, or it doesn't understand what to do with its big, human ideas.  Perhaps this is why the disappointment is greater, for despite all of the careful construction the carry-through is so inevitable and anticlimactic that one begins to question what it was all for.The acting and technical filmic aspects of the movie are strong. Geoffrey Rush is a superb actor and he brings life to every role I've found him in -- this one proving no exception. His character is unsavory, but vulnerable; he's unsympathetic, but we manage still to dig up empathy for his circumstances.It's a movie about idiosyncrasies while managing itself to be disappointingly conventional. It's clear that the creators were aiming for more and they very well might have succeeded if they'd sacrificed a bit of style and convention. Like so many before it, The Best Offer is lost somewhere between style and substance... but the style is fun to indulge for the duration. It's a fine bit of entertainment, but sadly not much more.",3,"Interesting, But Fleeting...",1389052800,"01 7, 2014",2014,3839,"['Best', 'Offer', 'film', 'once', 'unique', 'ingredients', 'familiar', 'recipe', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'hamburger', 'made', 'rarest', 'best', 'meats', 'terrible', 'analogy', 'film', 'satisfying', 'bit', 'entertainment', 'spotty', 'attempt', 'reach', 'bit', 'deeper', 'enjoyed', 'lasted', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'extended', 'praise', 'share.As', 'art', 'collector', 'artist', 'art', 'historian', 'somewhat', 'shut-in', 'film', 'several', 'superficial', 'levels', 'utterly', 'adore', 'subject', 'matter', 'still', 'find', 'deeply', 'interesting', ""n't"", 'quite', 'enough', 'parts', 'seem', 'be', 'greater', 'sum.The', 'world', 'buying', 'selling', 'forging', 'antiques', 'always', 'been', 'ripe', 'cinematic', 'literary', 'imagination', 'great', 'juxtaposition', 'beauty', 'malice', 'film', 'lineage', 'relatively', 'cerebral', 'mysterious', 'fiction', 'not', 'say', 'particularly', 'intelligent', 'especially', 'imaginative', 'efforts', 'be', 'Being', 'cerebral', 'existing', 'largely', 'emotions', 'behaviors', 'central', 'characters', 'opposed', 'blunt', 'action', 'can', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'dumb', 'explosion', 'car', 'chase', 'turn', 'thrill', 'added', 'peril', 'pretentiousness.Done', 'well', 'cerebral', 'narratives', 'are', 'best', 'sort', 'move', 'what', 'more', 'offer', 'explanations', 'why', 'are', 'moved', 'first', 'place', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'up', 'short', 'core', 'basic', 'heist', 'drama', 'up', 'latching', 'too', 'faithfully', 'metric', 'dressed', 'promising', 'dizzying', 'array', 'stops', 'starts', 'meandering', 'explorations', 'human', 'nature', 'are', 'just', 'dressing', 'same', 'story', 'repeated', 'million', 'times', 'never', 'particularly', 'pretentious', 'aspects', 'film', 'grate', 'sensibilities', 'e.g', 'bizarrely', 'intelligent', 'little', 'person', 'bar', 'who', 'overbearing', 'metaphor', 'narrative', 'parallel', 'wealthy', 'onlookers', 'ogling', 'Virgil', 'Oldman', 'gloves', 'protect', 'germs', 'gloves', 'are', ""n't"", 'odd', 'people', 'wear', 'why', 'pretend', 'otherwise', 'fact', 'Robert', 'have', 'really', 'great', 'location', 'tinkering', 'shop', 'never', 'do', 'anything', 'etc', 'rather', 'embrace', 'stilted', 'qualities', 'main', 'character', 'become', 'mired', 'melodrama', 'risky', 'plot', 'devices', 'succumb', 'oft-vapid', 'setting', 'art', 'antiques', 'world', 'film', 'self-deprecating', 'critical', 'enough', 'such', 'things', 'be', 'party', 'convincing', 'critic', 'same', 'time', 'moments', 'film', 'about', 'much', 'more', 'art', 'selling', 'it/obtaining', 'core', 'human', 'qualities', 'make', 'great', 'art', 'lasting', 'so', 'financially', 'valuable', 'then', ""n't"", 'endeavor', 'illuminate', 'own', 'findings', 'film', 'short', 'back', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'do', 'big', 'human', 'ideas', 'Perhaps', 'why', 'disappointment', 'greater', 'careful', 'construction', 'carry-through', 'so', 'inevitable', 'anticlimactic', 'one', 'question', 'what', 'was', 'for.The', 'acting', 'technical', 'filmic', 'aspects', 'movie', 'are', 'strong', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'superb', 'actor', 'life', 'role', ""'ve"", 'found', 'one', 'proving', 'exception', 'character', 'unsavory', 'vulnerable', 'unsympathetic', 'manage', 'still', 'dig', 'up', 'empathy', 'circumstances.It', 'movie', 'idiosyncrasies', 'managing', 'be', 'disappointingly', 'conventional', 'clear', 'creators', 'were', 'aiming', 'more', 'very', 'well', 'might', 'have', 'succeeded', ""'d"", 'sacrificed', 'bit', 'style', 'convention', 'so', 'many', 'Best', 'Offer', 'lost', 'somewhere', 'style', 'substance', 'style', 'fun', 'indulge', 'duration', 'fine', 'bit', 'entertainment', 'sadly', 'not', 'much', 'more']",The Best Offer

That said, the ending was anticlimactic. Not horribly so, but still, anticlimactic.I also am REALLY tired and bored of these implausible relationships between aged men who aren't particularly attractive and women who are far too young for them. These male fantasies are just so ridiculous. I'd have found it far more interesting and realistic for the female character to have been closer to his age and experience. I think I get why the filmmakers might have made the choice of such a young woman, but seriously, are older, effeminate men this delusional that a woman like that would be remotely interested and physically attracted to them? Can we not possibly imagine that an older woman (who by no means is less beautiful, just more textured), could hold the same sway?

Seemingly doesn't fit with the rest of the movie except that our central figure (auctioneer Oldman) is himself an unloved obsessive-compulsive automaton. Anyway, well disguised plot, even though about 80% through I thought ""No, this can't be one of those plot twisters."" which I quickly dismissed as too improbable given the background and challenges to pull it off.Worth five stars for it's creative writing, acting, sets, certainly props and directing (the sound of the dropped painting, the empty room except for the ...),  but reduced for the following:1. The implausibility of setting it all up without drawing notice; leaving a trace; no witnesses (well, one sort of).2. The film limiting itself to only our central character's pov thus having an excuse to not have to explain all the immense logistical challenges, time frames and implausibilities. Also, not giving us any background on our other main characters and their outcomes.3. The automaton appearing each day in pieces scattered about should have set off an alert investigative response from Oldman. Oldman, for his and his partner's intelligence, seemingly do nothing at the end of which there are many possibilities. Too weak!4. With Oldman's character, even though he steals from people, one is left with either a dismissive feeling toward him or actually pulling for him. Since the victims are not seen and he gets away with it, it's acceptable capitalist look-the-other-way ethics.Spoiler unresolves (read after seeing):5.

He is Virgil, a highly respected art auctioneer and evaluator. One day he gets a call from a woman who wishes to sell the art she inherited from her parents a year ago. As it turns out, she is extremely reclusive, refusing to meeting in person. Now Virgil become truly intrigued. In a parallel story line, we see how Virgil, with the help of Billy (played by Donald Sutherland), scoops up art work on the cheap, in particular female portrait paintings. His collection is astonishing. Meanwhile, back to the mysterious woman (played by Sylvia Hoeks), we learn her name is Claire and she is 27, and possibly suffering from agoraphobia. It isn't until midway into the movie when we actually get to see her, when Virgil tricks her into coming out of her room. What happens from here on? To tell you more of this plot-heavy movie would surely ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to experience it for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie is another tour de force from writer-director Giuseppe Tornatore, best known for his film &#34;Cinema Paradiso&#34;. The tone of the movie will suck you in almost from the opening scene, and as things play out and become weirder and yet more compelling, you just can't wait to see how it all plays out. Second, this is a towering performance from Geoffrey Rush, whom we just saw recently in &#34;The Book Thief&#34;. He is in virtually every frame of the movie. Third, the orchestral score of this movie plays prominently and comes again from the legendary composer Ennio Morricone, yes he of those spagetti westerns from the late 60s. (Morricone has scored all of Tornatore's movies.) On several occasions the overall feeling of this movie reminded me of the first half of Brian de Palma's 1980 movie &#34;Dressed To Kill&#34;, where we know things are not always as they seem and we delight into being 'duped'.I am probably one of the few here who saw the movie in a theater. I recently saw it at the Coral Gables Art Cinema in South Florida on a huge screen, and with perfect audio. It made for an overall very satisfying viewing experience. The screening I saw this at was surprisingly well attended, even for a matinee. Bottom line: &#34;Best Offer&#34; is a charming mystery-thriller that will captivate you from start to finish. &#34;Best Offer&#34; is definitely worth checking out, be it in the theater, on DVD/Blu-ray, or on Amazon Instant Demand.

Or at least that&#8217;s what it wants you to THINK it&#8217;s about. What it&#8217;s ACTUALLY about may be something else again.A self-described &#8220;old man incapable of love,&#8220; the allegorically named Virgil Oldman (Geoffrey Rush) has kept pretty much the entire world - women included - at arm&#8217;s-length for his entire life. He&#8217;s a renowned, if not entirely scrupulous, art appraiser and auctioneer who has his entire mode of existence turned upside down when he meets a mysterious young woman named Claire (Silvia Hoeks) who pleads with him to come appraise the belongings in her home upon the death of her wealthy parents. The problem is that Claire, who has been a recluse since the age of 16, seems to be suffering from a severe case of Agoraphobia and will speak with Virgil only through a wall in the house.  Dismissive, even irritated at first, Virgil soon becomes obsessed with the faceless, disembodied voice that floats to him through the dusky halls of a lonely villa.Virgil is so emotionally cut off from the world around him that, despite the fact that he is physically able to come and go, he is just as much a prisoner of his life as Claire is of her disease and of the decaying mansion in which she&#8217;s chosen to entomb herself. Is Claire the unexpected someone who will finally provide that meaningful human connection that Virgil has avoided all this time? Or is she merely the vehicle through which he will finally be made to pay for the many professional transgressions he&#8216;s committed over the course of his lifetime?Rush carries almost the entire weight of this film on his shoulders, and he certainly shows he has the acting chops to see it through. Since Hoeks is largely off-screen for large portions of the movie, her task is a somewhat less arduous one, though her accomplishment is no less impressive for that. Jim Sturgess and Donald Sutherland are also effective in smaller, yet highly significant, roles in the drama.With a smart screenplay and lyrical direction by Giuseppe Tornatore, &#8220;The Best Offer&#8221; is a haunting, mesmerizing film that draws you into its world and keeps you guessing every step of the way till the big reveal at the end.",4,Intricate tale of obsession and deceit,1404777600,"07 8, 2014",2014,2423,"['****1/2Set', 'Italy', 'filmed', 'English', '8220', 'Best', 'Offer', '8221', 'highly', 'unusual', 'unusually', 'interesting', 'tale', 'two', 'lost', 'hurting', 'souls', 'reaching', 'one', 'meaning', 'salvation', 'least', '8217', 's', 'what', 'THINK', '8217', 's', 'What', '8217', 's', 'ACTUALLY', 'may', 'be', 'something', 'else', 'self-described', '8220', 'old', 'man', 'incapable', 'love', '8220', 'allegorically', 'named', 'Virgil', 'Oldman', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'kept', 'pretty', 'much', 'entire', 'world', 'women', 'included', 'arm', '8217', 's-length', 'entire', 'life', '8217', 's', 'renowned', 'not', 'entirely', 'scrupulous', 'art', 'appraiser', 'auctioneer', 'who', 'entire', 'mode', 'existence', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'when', 'mysterious', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Claire', 'Silvia', 'Hoeks', 'who', 'pleads', 'come', 'appraise', 'belongings', 'home', 'death', 'wealthy', 'parents', 'problem', 'Claire', 'who', 'been', 'recluse', 'age', '16', 'be', 'suffering', 'severe', 'case', 'Agoraphobia', 'will', 'speak', 'Virgil', 'only', 'wall', 'house', 'Dismissive', 'even', 'irritated', 'first', 'Virgil', 'soon', 'obsessed', 'faceless', 'disembodied', 'voice', 'dusky', 'halls', 'lonely', 'villa.Virgil', 'so', 'emotionally', 'cut', 'off', 'world', 'fact', 'physically', 'able', 'come', 'go', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'prisoner', 'life', 'Claire', 'disease', 'decaying', 'mansion', '8217', 'chosen', 'entomb', 'Claire', 'unexpected', 'someone', 'who', 'will', 'finally', 'provide', 'meaningful', 'human', 'connection', 'Virgil', 'avoided', 'time', 'merely', 'vehicle', 'will', 'finally', 'be', 'made', 'pay', 'many', 'professional', 'transgressions', '8216', 'committed', 'course', 'lifetime', 'Rush', 'almost', 'entire', 'weight', 'film', 'shoulders', 'certainly', 'acting', 'chops', 'see', 'Hoeks', 'largely', 'off-screen', 'large', 'portions', 'movie', 'task', 'somewhat', 'less', 'arduous', 'one', 'accomplishment', 'less', 'impressive', 'Jim', 'Sturgess', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'are', 'also', 'effective', 'smaller', 'highly', 'significant', 'roles', 'drama.With', 'smart', 'screenplay', 'lyrical', 'direction', 'Giuseppe', 'Tornatore', '8220', 'Best', 'Offer', '8221', 'haunting', 'mesmerizing', 'film', 'world', 'guessing', 'step', 'way', 'big', 'reveal', 'end']",The Best Offer

But it&#8217;s cleverly and enticingly concealed. The movie begins with power, and it draws the viewer in.The movie begins with mystery and an abundance of beautiful works of art. The visuals Rush encounters everywhere he goes are overwhelmingly rich. I was hooked at once, but it didn&#8217;t last for long. The motif of the audible but invisible damsel in distress, neurotically whining away in some hidden nook of a villa packed with fascinating artifacts, wears thin after only a few scenes. And that recurrent motif is beaten to death. Finally, one feels, the screenwriter had a failure of imagination. A plot held tightly together at the beginning begins to meander and drift, and by the time I ejected the DVD, forty minutes from the end, the script seemed as if it had been written by a committee in a bar over a couple of pitchers of beer and a joint passed around under the table. The structure is loosely, or even accidentally, held together. The dialogue lacks the tightness that all fine films require.The production designer created a fabulously detailed Geppetto&#8217;s workshop for the gear-head character.

1680285,AWUUMER0F3WF4,B00GS08Y3Q,Sheryl Fechter,"[1, 1]","Virgil Oldman (Geoffrey Rush in a brilliant portrayal) is a well renowned dealer, auctioneer and a personal collector of fine art and antiquities.  He has amassed a huge store of painted portraits by sacrificing decades to lead a solitary and intentionally nonsocial life. The enormity of it all is best to be seen instead of reading too many of the details.  Virgil spends his self-absorbed time in an arrogant indifference towards others and indulges himself in a few eccentricities, such as his overly huge, and meticulously kept, walk-in closet filled with fashioned pairs of gloves.  Virgil does not touch anything without these gloves which also aid in shielding him from absolutely any physical contact with others.  He dines alone, does not carry a 'mobile phone', and seems to enjoy only his own company. Basically, Virgil does everything he can to make sure people are always on the outside of his world.  There are only a couple people privy to him in any way; one is a neighborhood tinker type shop owner, Robert (Jim Sturgess), to whom he brings in gadgets or mechanism for appraisal or repair, and an inquisitive banter.  Then there is his long-term friendly cohort, Billy Whistler (Donald Sutherland).Virgil and Billy have a history of working in tandem to drive up the price of a piece of art during an auction.  This may be if the particular piece isn't receiving high enough monetary bids then goes on to privatize its sale for Virgil.  Aside from this, he prefers to remain alone, both unbothered and unfettered by any relationships.  He has no tolerance for tedious imperfections or daily happenings outside of what only he desires, which mainly has to do with artwork.  Rush portrays this indignant and arrogant man with an air of superiority; it is written all over him and he wears it very well.  His facial features smack of condescension while he's talking with anyone, even while someone may be doing him a favor.  During the beginning of the movie, one can see how easy he makes this appear and how easy it is to not really care too much about Virgil in return. But that is then ...Everything begins to change when he finally accepts a phone call from the young, and lovely, heiress, Claire Ibbetson (Sylvia Hoeks), who is in need of a valuation of the furnishings and some paintings at her villa.  This was all left behind after her parents passing.  She remains hidden from view of Virgil which is even more intriguing for him. Claire is quite lonely, a prisoner of her own home while suffering from agoraphobia, and watching it all fall down around her.  Virgil apprehensively begins to work with the beguiling woman. He soon finds that through her, and her phobia, he is indirectly working on himself. A very suspenseful movie at times, including meticulously photographed sets (Fabio Zamarion) and a mastery of storytelling, written and directed by Giuseppe Tornatore, a work enfolds that is heart rendering, shocking, and romantic.  A mystery of entangled emotions starts to build and grow to the point of awe for the viewer; at least for myself.  There isn't a detail that is not shown as we experience some of the most visually and emotionally stunning scenes that have us questioning the meaning behind the richly metaphoric 'Best Offer' (Originally titled - 'La Migliore Offerta'). It is breathtakingly brave, bold, and beautifully done ...",5,"""The Regard I Have Always Had For Women Is Equal To The Fear I Have Of Them"" - Virgil Oldman",1405296000,"07 14, 2014",2014,3377,"['Virgil', 'Oldman', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'brilliant', 'portrayal', 'well', 'renowned', 'dealer', 'auctioneer', 'personal', 'collector', 'fine', 'art', 'antiquities', 'amassed', 'huge', 'store', 'painted', 'portraits', 'sacrificing', 'decades', 'lead', 'solitary', 'intentionally', 'nonsocial', 'life', 'enormity', 'best', 'be', 'seen', 'instead', 'reading', 'too', 'many', 'details', 'Virgil', 'self-absorbed', 'time', 'arrogant', 'indifference', 'towards', 'others', 'few', 'eccentricities', 'such', 'overly', 'huge', 'meticulously', 'kept', 'walk-in', 'closet', 'filled', 'fashioned', 'pairs', 'gloves', 'Virgil', 'not', 'touch', 'anything', 'gloves', 'also', 'aid', 'shielding', 'absolutely', 'physical', 'contact', 'others', 'alone', 'not', 'carry', ""'mobile"", 'phone', 'enjoy', 'only', 'own', 'company', 'Basically', 'Virgil', 'everything', 'can', 'make', 'sure', 'people', 'are', 'always', 'outside', 'world', 'are', 'only', 'couple', 'people', 'privy', 'way', 'one', 'neighborhood', 'tinker', 'type', 'shop', 'owner', 'Robert', 'Jim', 'Sturgess', 'whom', 'gadgets', 'mechanism', 'appraisal', 'repair', 'inquisitive', 'banter', 'Then', 'long-term', 'friendly', 'cohort', 'Billy', 'Whistler', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', '.Virgil', 'Billy', 'have', 'history', 'working', 'tandem', 'drive', 'up', 'price', 'piece', 'art', 'auction', 'may', 'be', 'particular', 'piece', ""n't"", 'receiving', 'high', 'enough', 'monetary', 'bids', 'then', 'privatize', 'sale', 'Virgil', 'Aside', 'remain', 'alone', 'unbothered', 'unfettered', 'relationships', 'tolerance', 'tedious', 'imperfections', 'daily', 'happenings', 'what', 'only', 'mainly', 'do', 'artwork', 'Rush', 'indignant', 'arrogant', 'man', 'air', 'superiority', 'written', 'very', 'well', 'facial', 'features', 'smack', 'condescension', 'talking', 'anyone', 'even', 'someone', 'may', 'be', 'doing', 'favor', 'beginning', 'movie', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'easy', 'appear', 'how', 'easy', 'not', 'really', 'care', 'too', 'much', 'Virgil', 'return', 'then', 'Everything', 'begins', 'change', 'when', 'finally', 'phone', 'call', 'young', 'lovely', 'heiress', 'Claire', 'Ibbetson', 'Sylvia', 'Hoeks', 'who', 'need', 'valuation', 'furnishings', 'paintings', 'villa', 'was', 'left', 'behind', 'parents', 'passing', 'hidden', 'view', 'Virgil', 'even', 'more', 'intriguing', 'Claire', 'quite', 'lonely', 'prisoner', 'own', 'home', 'suffering', 'agoraphobia', 'watching', 'fall', 'down', 'Virgil', 'apprehensively', 'work', 'beguiling', 'woman', 'soon', 'phobia', 'indirectly', 'working', 'very', 'suspenseful', 'movie', 'times', 'including', 'meticulously', 'photographed', 'sets', 'Fabio', 'Zamarion', 'mastery', 'storytelling', 'written', 'directed', 'Giuseppe', 'Tornatore', 'work', 'enfolds', 'heart', 'rendering', 'shocking', 'romantic', 'mystery', 'entangled', 'emotions', 'build', 'grow', 'point', 'awe', 'viewer', 'least', ""n't"", 'detail', 'not', 'shown', 'experience', 'most', 'visually', 'emotionally', 'stunning', 'scenes', 'have', 'questioning', 'meaning', 'richly', 'metaphoric', ""'Best"", 'Offer', 'Originally', 'titled', ""'La"", 'Migliore', 'Offerta', 'breathtakingly', 'brave', 'bold', 'beautifully', 'done']",The Best Offer

You see their relationship unfold through his handling of her estate. You see more about him than most people around him even know about him as you watch him before and during this encounter with this woman. For one he is a forger, himself, while sniffing out forgeries to remove from his high priced auctions. He schemes with a pal of his to get paintings he wants. He even pretends one is a fake only to lower the price for himself. It isn't that he wants to be rich by owning the original. He even has his pal bid top dollar for the auction bidding. It is that he wants the female portrait as he collects such portraits to hang in his hidden room. He sits and stares at his collection of women instead of experiencing them in real life. It is only fitting he meets up with a secretive loner like himself who, herself, hides in a room from the world among beautiful art. The guy even steals from her all the while falling for her. While you seem to be convinced she is who she claims to be you still wonder what his motives are as he is neither totally evil nor totally good. Regardless, unfortunately for him he is not the only one who can set up people in the art world for a take.

What starts off a a selfish way to get something becomes more and Virgil becomes obsessed with Claire, but things aren't always what the seem. Going into this movie I was expecting something slow and boring. How can a movie about an auctioneer obsessed with art be any good? After watching this I have to admit that I really enjoyed this and was sucked in the entire time. There is basically nothing overly exciting as far as action goes in this but the story and acting really makes you want to keep watching. Even though the movie is a little predictable there are still enough surprises to keep it exciting. Geoffrey Rush is great in this and I really enjoyed this much more then I expected to.
