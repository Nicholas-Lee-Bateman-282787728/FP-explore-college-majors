195198,ABUPU4PJ36VJ0,1878859900,History On Fire,"[0, 3]","Read the 1 star reviews.  That's what I do when I want to really learn about a movie or product I am considering.  It amazes me some of the 1 stars I read: ""I didn't like the photo on the disc.""  ""The movie was scratched I ordered another one.""  ""I thought Kirk Cameron was in this.""  ""I didn't know this was a boring documentary.""  What?  What do any of those, except perhaps the last one have anything to do with your opinion of the movie?  :)Now consider this:This is a DOCUMENTARY...not a movie staring the incredibly handsome Kirk Cameron.  By the way, did you know that even when acting he will not kiss another woman other than his wife?  Call in the stunt lips ala Chelsea Noble.  Chelsea Noble is also an actress.  You may remember Kate MacDonald on the American television sitcom Growing Pains.This film is about sharing your FAITH.  That means you will hear words like: Bible, Jesus, God, Holy Spirit, Christian.  If those words offend you...then these words will terrify you, ""Depart from me you worker of iniquity [sin] for I never knew you.""  Who said that?  Jesus Christ of Nazareth.  Well, I don't believe in Jesus.  That's ok...you don't have to believe in Him.  Just like you do not have to believe I will shoot you with my 44 Magnum between your eyes. You don't believe me?  It don't really matter does it?This film does an EXCELLENT JOB in sharing God and the Bible and how you can have a relationship with Him.This film gives you great tools that you can use to win souls.Kirk Cameron does a great job and his buddy Evangelist Ray Comfort has a way with words...Comfort is a little short ( I think about 4' 9"") If short people offend you then you may want to skip this movie.Kirk Cameron is rather handsome...probably more handsome than you...if handsome people offend you...then you may not want to watch this film.If you are saved and know the Lord this film will convict you for not doing what the Bible commands us.  If being convicted offends you...you may want to find a nice Family movie.If you are a heathen and do not know the Lord then you will come face to face with a decision.  If being confronted with decisions...and what is the most important decision of your life then...YOU NEED TO GET THIS MOVIE AND WATCH IT IMMEDIATELY.I highly recommend this film.  Get it,...watch it in your church group...discuss the tools...go into the streets and use them.  God Bless you!!!!P.S. Every has a right to their own opinion.  As long as at the end of the day they realize that MY opinion was the only one right. :) LOL Just kidding.
