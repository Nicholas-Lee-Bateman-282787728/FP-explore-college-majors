The information was excellent and the visuals were fantastic. The only thing I can't stand in dino-documenteries is recycled footage.

The only downside here is that due to budget limitations you see the same shots over and over. This was not a big budget bbc affair though so they did that to save money. However the information you get makes it worth it. If you can't listen to the different facts without seeing new footage you will join the one star reviewers.

1345761,A1IUE52O75XPZS,B003H8F43K,teatime,"[1, 2]","The main problem with this series is the repetitiveness.  Each episode reuses the same footage over and over and over.  You think to yourself, ""No!they can't show that AGAIN"", but yes they do...twenty more times.  We see the same dino take the same poop (for no reason & unrelated to the narration) at least 7 times--or more--I lost count. I started to cringe from seeing the same footage repeated.  Then, the only dinos featured are basically the T-rex, a really large planteater, a raptor, triceratops, & one flying dino--that's it.  By episode 2 you still have the same dinos & same footage.  They repeat each point about 10 times in each episode by slightly varying the words or who says it. Lazy writing.  Then, in the next episode, they repeat it again!  These guys know how to bust out a thesaurus! It would have been better to do episode one: just planteater, epidode 2: just t-rex, episode 3: raptor vs. flying dino, etc. than repeat the same info to death.Also, they make it seem like t-rex was only eating triceratops! Unlikely, especially given the inherent danger of attacking triceratops & potentially being mortally wounded. There were so many types of easier prey, sick & older animals, & carrion that T-Rex was after. So, some inconsistencies & information is biased based upon what the producers could ""show"" based on very limited reels.  I would have preferred more information, showing more paleontologists, more fossils, etc., than see the same cgi scenes on a loop.I got bored. Wanted to love it; but it's just too lazy.

I have all of the decent (and not so decent) dinosaur DVDs that are out there. This one, I tell you assuredly, is one of the best.  The format is a lot like the Jurassic Fight Club set... and it even has some of the same paleontologists giving comments and insights as did Jurassic Fight Club; this is fortunate, as I feel that they are extremely interesting and radiate their enthusiasm, helping one to be all the more appreciative of these amazing creatures.  A good number of the dino animation is rehashed within the four episodes (just like Jurassic Fight Club reused dino footage); but enough new material, of new dino types, is thrown in such that it still makes for great viewing pleasure.  The previous reviewer did not like the same material being used and would rather have fewer episodes with less repetition.  I like it the way it is... because new information and new insights are provided throughout, and the computer simulations are so good that I enjoy watching them again.  Realistically speaking, one cannot expect endless episodes with all new simulations in each... as the Discovery Channel and any other outfit has budget restraints and limitations just like with any production company.This is a very well thought out production and I was pleased about it in many respects.  I'm a vegetarian, and it was excellent how this set elaborated on how the vegetarian dinosaurs coped with the onslaught from the carnivores. The carnivorous dinosaurs often risked their lives while engaging with the plant eaters; often they would be injured and even killed by them.  T-rex wasn't always the king... despite how cool and classy the tyrannosaurs were!  I've seen other films suggesting things such as that Triceratops horns were not useful as weapons against predators... that they were mainly for display.  This set puts that ludicrous idea out... and does a splendid job in numerous other areas as well! Bravo!It's a good thing that that asteroid finally hit... otherwise we would still all be hiding under rocks and logs!  ;)",5,Excellent Dino DVD!,1282780800,"08 26, 2010",2010,2137,"['have', 'been', 'interested', 'dinosaurs', 'many', 'years', 'go', 'fossil', 'hunting', 'one', 'hobbies', 'have', 'decent', 'not', 'so', 'decent', 'dinosaur', 'DVDs', 'are', 'there', 'one', 'tell', 'assuredly', 'one', 'best', 'format', 'lot', 'Jurassic', 'Fight', 'Club', 'set', 'even', 'same', 'paleontologists', 'giving', 'comments', 'insights', 'did', 'Jurassic', 'Fight', 'Club', 'fortunate', 'feel', 'are', 'extremely', 'interesting', 'radiate', 'enthusiasm', 'helping', 'one', 'be', 'more', 'appreciative', 'amazing', 'creatures', 'good', 'number', 'dino', 'animation', 'rehashed', 'four', 'episodes', 'just', 'Jurassic', 'Fight', 'Club', 'reused', 'dino', 'footage', 'enough', 'new', 'material', 'new', 'dino', 'types', 'thrown', 'such', 'still', 'great', 'viewing', 'pleasure', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'did', 'not', 'same', 'material', 'being', 'used', 'would', 'rather', 'have', 'fewer', 'episodes', 'less', 'repetition', 'way', 'new', 'information', 'new', 'insights', 'are', 'provided', 'computer', 'simulations', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'again', 'Realistically', 'speaking', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'expect', 'endless', 'episodes', 'new', 'simulations', 'Discovery', 'Channel', 'other', 'outfit', 'budget', 'restraints', 'limitations', 'just', 'production', 'company.This', 'very', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'production', 'was', 'pleased', 'many', 'respects', ""'m"", 'vegetarian', 'was', 'excellent', 'how', 'set', 'elaborated', 'how', 'vegetarian', 'dinosaurs', 'coped', 'onslaught', 'carnivores', 'carnivorous', 'dinosaurs', 'often', 'risked', 'lives', 'engaging', 'plant', 'eaters', 'often', 'would', 'be', 'injured', 'even', 'killed', 'T-rex', 'was', ""n't"", 'always', 'king', 'how', 'cool', 'tyrannosaurs', 'were', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'films', 'suggesting', 'things', 'such', 'Triceratops', 'horns', 'were', 'not', 'useful', 'weapons', 'predators', 'were', 'mainly', 'display', 'set', 'ludicrous', 'idea', 'splendid', 'job', 'numerous', 'other', 'areas', 'well', 'Bravo', 'good', 'thing', 'finally', 'hit', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'hiding', 'rocks', 'logs']",N/A
1345764,ABGOCL0QVZRUL,B003H8F43K,W. Andrew Terrill,"[2, 2]","I recognize that some of the criticisms of this product are credible, but this work also has substantial strengths as well as occasional shortcomings.  My favorite episode is ""the Defenders"" which has a lot to say about armored dinosaurs and ceratopsians like triceratops.  It also has the distinguished paleontologist Bob Bakker presenting his theories about the hadrasaur, parasaurolaphus using infrasound in herds as a unified defense against a predator.  While this theory is too good not to include, I do not believe it has a large following yet. Another scene involving combat between a Tyrannosaurus and a Triceratops is particularly realistic and includes fight sequences based on important fossil evidence outlined in Gregory Paul's THE PRINCETON FIELD GUIDE TO DINOSAURS.  Specifically, this fight scene includes the T-rex tactic of biting and breaking the Triceratops's horns to disarm it and struggling to prevent the other animal from spearing it in the process. It is also worth noting that the discovery of this tactic is an important data point indicating that Tyrannosaurs were not simply scavengers as has sometimes been postulated (if the interpretation of the fossils is correct).  No need to break the horns on a dead carcass if that is your meal for the day. Future fossil finds may help to clarify this issue since we have only one example of such a fight (that I know of).
