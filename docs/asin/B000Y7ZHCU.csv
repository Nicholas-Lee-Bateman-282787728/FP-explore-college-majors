1116418,A2WHQZXGP0DOYS,B000Y7ZHCU,Buddy S,"[92, 98]","I saw this concert in Las Vegas in September, 2007 and enjoyed watching this DVD just as much as, if not more than, watching the live concert itself.  This DVD comes very close to replicating both the visual and audio impact of the actual concert.Celine Dion gives a super performance, but the concert is much more than just the vocals - - the songs are woven into an elaborate Las Vegas style stage production.  The concert venue, the Coliseum at Caesar's Palace, was built specifically for this show, which opened in 2003 and closed in December, 2007.  The arena has 4,000 seats placed in a semi circle around an immense stage.  The seats are positioned so that no seat is more than 120 feet from the stage.The stage production was arranged by Franco Dragone, a Belgian film and theater director.  Before ""A New Day,"" he directed the Las Vegas Cirque De Soleil productions of ""Mystere"" and ""O.""  It is therefore not surprising that dancers perform during virtually every song.  The troupe has about 60 dancers, but they rarely all appear on stage at the same time.  The dancing is accompanied by magnificent stage effects, which feature, among other things, a tree sprouting from the stage; dancers gently dropping from the rafters on swings and other props; a man riding a bicycle into the sky (much as ET did in the movie); dancers floating above the stage in large picture frames; floating dancers pushing floating street lights; and, last but not least, a grand piano complete with a piano player floating above the stage floor.  This DVD does an excellent job of capturing both the dancing and elaborate staging, while not compromising the video of Celine Dion performing.Celine sings a total of 18 songs.  The set begins with seven of her biggest hits: A New Day Has Come, The Power of Love, It's All Coming Back to Me Now, Because You Loved Me, To Love You More, I'm Alive and I Drove All Night.  She then sings the less familiar ""Seduces Me"" and ""If I Could.""  This is followed by her biggest French language hit ""Pour Que Tu M'Aimes Encore,"" ""I Surrender,"" and an Italian language song ""Ammore Annascunnuto.""  Following this, she sings two Frank Sinatra songs: ""All The Way"" and ""I've Got the World on a String"" (during which she is accompanied in part by old video of Sinatra singing.)  Next is ""I Wish,"" ""Love Can Move Mountains,"" and ""River Deep, Mountain High.""  The finale is the theme song from Titanic ""My Heart Can Go On.""  Celine's voice is clear and powerful throughout the show and she delivers each song with perfection.There are several bonus features of interest on the second disk in this DVD set: the first is a behind the scenes rundown of the entire show, starting at the point where Celine leaves her Las Vegas home and is driven in a limo to Caesar's Palace.  The feature follows pre show preparations and, while the concert is in progress, shows some of the back stage activity including costume changes, performers running to get in the correct position for the next song and a depiction of how dancers and stage props float across the stage and down from the rafters, etc.  The second ""extra"" tells the history of the production, starting with Celine meeting Franco Dragone and the development of the idea of Celine performing a long run engagement in Las Vegas.  It then details a series of significant events, such as designing and building the theater, recruiting and auditioning cast members, and opening night in 2003.  The information is furnished mostly through interviews with Celine, her managers, Dragone, and cast members.The bottom line is that this is a great concert DVD.  If you enjoy Celine Dion's music, you will not make a mistake buying this one - the performance is mesmerizing.",5,WOW!

I purchased this Blu Ray Disc so that I could demonstrate what an oustanding production looks like to those just getting into high definition.  This is what I have to say;  This is the way God would have done it if He had the money.  Even if you are not a Celine Dion fan, you would appreciate this Blu Ray disc.  This has undoubtedly the highest production values, bar none, than any other live production I have ever seen. The stage that she performs on is a state of the art, computerized marvel of a  masterpiece of science and technology. The performance itself was flawless; afterall they had four years and 700 performances to rehearse. The more I watch this disc, the more I become a Celine Dion fan.  This is the epitome of excellence in live productions.  You cannot go wrong with this one and its well worth the money, and you'll  want to watch it again and again.  On the negative side, this has nothing to do with the contents of the disc, but the disc itself.  I use a high end computer to play back my discs, either Blu Ray or HD with an LG Super Multi drive and Win DVD 9 and Power DVD Ultra software.

That you will hate Dion is quite unlikely. She is surrounded by dancers, acrobats, singers, and every sort of fireworks imaginable, yet she manages to hold center stage quite easily with strong vocal performances of songs with which the audience, if not you and I, seem quite at home.

If Mia had drastically cut the number of dancers and punted more their dancing skills (and highlighted these during Celine's singing) the whoa impact of the show would have taken it several notches up.

Definitely worth 2 hours of your time. The other, more interview style, featurette is also informative and very interesting.

It caught me off guard the power her voice and presentation has touched this mans heart but you don't have any control of such things.I ordered the two disk set and waited for my ""Christmas Gift"" to me to arrive and boy it blew me away.  I would go into the way the DVD is shot and the way the Director framed his shots but it isn't about that is is about the way Celine's power as a performer jumps off the screen and goes like a laser to your heart.The song selection is fantasic and even the more abreviated past hits get a fuller treatment then other concert performers allow for those songs that we all grow to love.  I was impressed most of all with the  both the vocals and stage performace of the dancers for ""I Surrender"". and to a lesser extent to the fun loving pace of ""I Drove All Night"". They would serve well as stand alone Videos.  And what can I say about ""My Heart Will Go On"" that hasn't been said by other reviewers.The extras are very welcome and add a warm side dish to the feast that this set is to the true Celine fan.

While she has taken a beating from the media and from detractors for being over-the-top in some of her vocals, a bit too dorky in her performances and in interviews, she has remained (sans the chest-beating) true to herself and to the music and fans that made her famous.This DVD set is not only for those who saw the show and want a copy of it to remember, or for those who didn't get to see it and wanted to, but it really feels first and foremost like a gift to her die-hard fans.  Most others wouldn't care for the extended amount of footage (over 3 hours worth) dedicated to the trivia about the show, its creation, execution and evolution over the past four years.I did see the show twice in 2003, and feel that the DVD does a wonderful job of recreating the experience, but if you didn't get to Vegas and sit in the theater that was specifically built for this show, it's not the same.A couple of other differences for those who saw the show: Nature Boy was omitted as the opening and swapped out for the more appropriate ""A New Day Has Come"" .. I always thought it was odd that the title song from the show was not sung back in 2003.  Also removed is the tacky and ill-fitting cover of ""Fever"", but added in are ""Love Can Move Mountains"" (one of my favorites of hers of all time) and ""River Deep, Mountain High"" in full Tina Turner Tribute mode.I do regret the omission of two of my personal favorite songs from the shows I saw in 2003 - Je'taime Encore (I Love You Still), one of her most haunting French-language songs she's ever recorded, and the show-ending ""What a Wonderful World"" that, as she sang it, had black and white photos of people from the audience on the giant LCD screen behind her.  It was a touching and intimate way to end a very theatrical production.  You CAN, however, get both of the audio recordings of these two songs on the live CD of the show that was released a few years back.The fan tribute on here, while often cheesy, is also an endearing look at some of her biggest fans.  That Celine was gracious and kind as she met personally with them all, moved to tears by some of their personal 'thank you's to her, underscores the grace and humility that accompanies the great gift of song she received.",5,Almost perfect..,1199491200,"01 5, 2008",2008,2339,"['Celine', 'Dion', 'one', 'most', 'generous', 'sincere', 'artists', 'music', 'today', 'pretty', 'well-known', 'taken', 'beating', 'media', 'detractors', 'being', 'over-the-top', 'vocals', 'bit', 'too', 'dorky', 'performances', 'interviews', 'remained', 'chest-beating', 'true', 'herself', 'music', 'fans', 'made', 'famous.This', 'DVD', 'set', 'not', 'only', 'who', 'saw', 'show', 'want', 'copy', 'remember', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'wanted', 'really', 'first', 'foremost', 'gift', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'Most', 'others', 'would', ""n't"", 'care', 'extended', 'amount', 'footage', '3', 'hours', 'worth', 'dedicated', 'trivia', 'show', 'creation', 'execution', 'evolution', 'past', 'four', 'years.I', 'did', 'see', 'show', 'twice', '2003', 'feel', 'DVD', 'wonderful', 'job', 'recreating', 'experience', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'Vegas', 'sit', 'theater', 'was', 'specifically', 'built', 'show', 'not', 'same.A', 'couple', 'other', 'differences', 'who', 'saw', 'show', 'Nature', 'Boy', 'was', 'omitted', 'opening', 'swapped', 'out', 'more', 'appropriate', 'New', 'Day', 'Has', 'Come', '..', 'always', 'thought', 'was', 'odd', 'title', 'song', 'show', 'was', 'not', 'sung', 'back', '2003', 'Also', 'removed', 'tacky', 'ill-fitting', 'cover', 'Fever', 'added', 'are', 'Love', 'Can', 'Move', 'Mountains', 'one', 'favorites', 'hers', 'time', 'River', 'Deep', 'Mountain', 'High', 'full', 'Tina', 'Turner', 'Tribute', 'mode.I', 'do', 'regret', 'omission', 'two', 'personal', 'favorite', 'songs', 'shows', 'saw', '2003', ""Je'taime"", 'Encore', 'Love', 'Still', 'one', 'most', 'haunting', 'French-language', 'songs', 'ever', 'recorded', 'show-ending', 'What', 'Wonderful', 'World', 'sang', 'had', 'black', 'white', 'photos', 'people', 'audience', 'giant', 'LCD', 'screen', 'was', 'touching', 'intimate', 'way', 'end', 'very', 'theatrical', 'production', 'CAN', 'however', 'get', 'audio', 'recordings', 'two', 'songs', 'live', 'CD', 'show', 'was', 'released', 'few', 'years', 'back.The', 'fan', 'tribute', 'here', 'often', 'cheesy', 'also', 'endearing', 'look', 'biggest', 'fans', 'Celine', 'was', 'gracious', 'kind', 'met', 'personally', 'moved', 'tears', 'personal', 'grace', 'humility', 'great', 'gift', 'song', 'received']",N/A

Not only do you get the complete concert but you get three other bonus features that are all about or over an hour long.First, the concert. I've seen it twice in Vegas. This one was pretty good although, to me, she seemed a little tired during some of the performances. ""I'm Alive"" in particular wasn't very good. She pretty much doesn't care how ""Love Can Move Mountains"" turns out anymore. She just goes out there and sings whatever. But there are two fantastic performances and those are the Italian song and ""River Deep.""The bonus features start with a ""Tribute to the Fans"" which is touching and also a little creepy. Some of the stories are heart warming and others make the people look a bit sad. One woman says she's had two miracles in her life and one is beating cancer and the other is meeting Celine. I mean...she's had NOTHING else happen in her life more important than meeting a celebrity? And the people that got Celine tattooed on their bodies need some kind of therapy. I think even Celine was creeped out by that.Another bonus feature is the complete concert but back stage and it is absoutely fascinating what goes on back there and just how much energy is put in to putting on each show every day. The dancers all work extremely hard and Celine is running around non stop and never gets a break. The time she's off stage is spent rushing to put on the next dress. And you almost get to see a naked Celine in this.The last feature is an hour of interviews with everybody who put the show together and everything that happened. Celine talks about her ugly blonde hair period. They also show some of the performance of the night when she lost her dad.Great DVD.

The breezy 90 minute set shares some similarities with Taking Chances Tour. It has the medley of It's All Coming Back To Me Now/Because You Loved Me/To Love You More and closes with Love Can Move Mountains, River Deep Mountain High and Mt Heart Will Go On. The set list have to keep with the stipulated duration, so only a few songs from her albums A New Day Has Come and One Heart are performed.As much as the visual aspect is important, it cannot replace Celine's genuine enthusiasm, her zest and the way she touches the audiences with her heartfelt performances. Just look at how many of them cry during her show.This production will give the other queens of the concert extravaganza namely Cher, Kylie and Madonna a run for the money.Bonus Feature:Because You Loved Me A Tribute To The FansI really liked this as it interviews fans around the world who fly in to see the show. It details their thoughts before meeting her, their journey to Las Vegas and the touching moments during the meet-and-greet.Special Feature:A New Day All Access.Basically a backstage pass. The sound volume for this feature is somewhat softer. It shows Celine travelling to the venue, doing sound checks, the dancers getting excited etc. During the concert, the feature splits into two screens. One showing Celine onstage and another detailing what actually happens backstage. You see the technical aspects, like how the performers are fitted with harnesses in order to fly. They managed to sneak in some peek-a-boo shots of Celine changing.Bonus Feature:A New Day: The Secrets.The show was taped with Celine with short blonde hair. Unfortunately, they had to throw it out as the fans did not like it. But they saved some footage of her flying through the six storey theatre singing The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face which is not on the concert feature. There are plenty of insights from cast and crew to make this one a must watch as the show is not as easy as it looks.The PackagingThat's the only beef I have. It's very difficult to remove the discs as you have to slide them carefully out from the holder. Sony could use the conventional type for future pressings.A New Day is really a great package which explains why it has gone triple diamond in Canada and multi-platinum in many countries.",5,Celine Meets Cirque Du Soleil,1318809600,"10 17, 2011",2011,2666,"['2', 'DVD', 'set', 'contain', '4', 'features', 'ConcertA', '300', 'million', 'production', 'Celine', 'performing', '4000', 'seater', 'theatre', 'specially', 'built', 'show.Unlike', 'Taking', 'Chances', 'was', 'staged', 'humongous', 'stadium', 'New', 'Day', 'Live', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'more', 'intimate', 'show', 'plenty', 'performers', 'flying', 'mid', 'air', 'dazzling', 'props', 'sets', 'Celine', 'nifty', 'footwork', 'breezy', '90', 'minute', 'set', 'shares', 'similarities', 'Taking', 'Chances', 'Tour', 'medley', 'Coming', 'Back', 'Me', 'Now/Because', 'Loved', 'Me/To', 'Love', 'More', 'Love', 'Can', 'Move', 'Mountains', 'River', 'Deep', 'Mountain', 'High', 'Mt', 'Heart', 'Will', 'Go', 'set', 'list', 'have', 'keep', 'stipulated', 'duration', 'only', 'few', 'songs', 'albums', 'New', 'Day', 'Has', 'Come', 'One', 'Heart', 'are', 'performed.As', 'much', 'visual', 'aspect', 'important', 'can', 'not', 'replace', 'Celine', 'genuine', 'enthusiasm', 'zest', 'way', 'audiences', 'heartfelt', 'performances', 'Just', 'look', 'how', 'many', 'cry', 'show.This', 'production', 'will', 'give', 'other', 'queens', 'concert', 'extravaganza', 'namely', 'Cher', 'Kylie', 'Madonna', 'run', 'money.Bonus', 'Feature', 'Loved', 'A', 'Tribute', 'FansI', 'really', 'liked', 'fans', 'world', 'who', 'fly', 'see', 'show', 'details', 'thoughts', 'meeting', 'journey', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'touching', 'moments', 'meet-and-greet.Special', 'Feature', 'New', 'Day', 'All', 'Access.Basically', 'backstage', 'pass', 'sound', 'volume', 'feature', 'somewhat', 'softer', 'Celine', 'travelling', 'venue', 'doing', 'sound', 'checks', 'dancers', 'getting', 'excited', 'etc', 'concert', 'feature', 'two', 'screens', 'One', 'showing', 'Celine', 'onstage', 'detailing', 'what', 'actually', 'backstage', 'see', 'technical', 'aspects', 'how', 'performers', 'are', 'fitted', 'harnesses', 'order', 'fly', 'managed', 'sneak', 'peek-a-boo', 'shots', 'Celine', 'changing.Bonus', 'Feature', 'New', 'Day', 'Secrets.The', 'show', 'was', 'taped', 'Celine', 'short', 'blonde', 'hair', 'Unfortunately', 'had', 'throw', 'out', 'fans', 'did', 'not', 'saved', 'footage', 'flying', 'six', 'storey', 'theatre', 'singing', 'First', 'Time', 'Ever', 'Saw', 'Your', 'Face', 'not', 'concert', 'feature', 'are', 'plenty', 'insights', 'cast', 'crew', 'make', 'one', 'must', 'watch', 'show', 'not', 'as', 'easy', 'PackagingThat', 'only', 'beef', 'have', 'very', 'difficult', 'remove', 'discs', 'have', 'slide', 'carefully', 'holder', 'Sony', 'could', 'use', 'conventional', 'type', 'future', 'pressings.A', 'New', 'Day', 'really', 'great', 'package', 'why', 'gone', 'triple', 'diamond', 'Canada', 'multi-platinum', 'many', 'countries']",N/A

The big problem I have is the oboard action of the filming. The show itself is a huge spectacle, which would benefit from lots of long, slow-moving shots that allow the viewer to take in what is happening on stage. Instead, the footage is chopped and slightly erratic. There come points where, between the action on stage and the rapid flurries of changing camera shots, the whole thing becomes a dizzying blur.I was actually on the film crew for the making of this dvd, and having seen the show live 4 times during that process, I can attest to the fact that this dvd fails to capture the true artistry onstage.The problem is that the whole thing is edited as though it were a standard concert, with nothing but immobile musicians to view, where active angle changes are needed to keep things interesting to watch. This is not an ordinary concert setting, though. The importance of capturing the huge stage show seems to be lost in the shuffle, with the film being creative right over top of the show's creativity, forming a muddled mess which, while still eye grabbing (and great sounding) really fails to capture the impact of the show in the way it could have.",3,"The show is great, but the DVD has some flaws.",1201996800,"02 3, 2008",2008,1243,"['Well', 'great', 'live', 'show', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'happy', 'am', 'dvd', 'big', 'problem', 'have', 'oboard', 'action', 'filming', 'show', 'huge', 'spectacle', 'would', 'benefit', 'lots', 'long', 'slow-moving', 'shots', 'allow', 'viewer', 'take', 'what', 'happening', 'stage', 'Instead', 'footage', 'chopped', 'slightly', 'erratic', 'come', 'points', 'where', 'action', 'stage', 'rapid', 'flurries', 'changing', 'camera', 'shots', 'whole', 'thing', 'dizzying', 'blur.I', 'was', 'actually', 'film', 'crew', 'making', 'dvd', 'having', 'seen', 'show', 'live', '4', 'times', 'process', 'can', 'attest', 'fact', 'dvd', 'capture', 'true', 'artistry', 'onstage.The', 'problem', 'whole', 'thing', 'edited', 'were', 'standard', 'concert', 'nothing', 'immobile', 'musicians', 'view', 'where', 'active', 'angle', 'changes', 'are', 'needed', 'keep', 'things', 'interesting', 'watch', 'not', 'ordinary', 'concert', 'setting', 'though', 'importance', 'capturing', 'huge', 'stage', 'show', 'be', 'lost', 'shuffle', 'film', 'being', 'creative', 'right', 'top', 'show', 'creativity', 'forming', 'muddled', 'mess', 'still', 'eye', 'grabbing', 'great', 'sounding', 'really', 'capture', 'impact', 'show', 'way', 'could', 'have']",N/A

This would be a great souvenir if you went to see the show live and a wonderful performance to watch and listen to if you weren't able to see her in Vegas. I recommend you buy the two-disc DVD set---the special features are outstanding since after you watch her live show you can then watch from backstage as they are doing the show and then watch the interviews including footage of Celine at home with her son and husband. Her voice is amazing and the selection of songs for her final year of shows is great. I suggest you Google Celine Dion and her ""A New Day"" DVD and see and hear a sample of the show, esp. ""River Deep, Mountain High"" if you haven't seen her perform this song the way she did it in Vegas.
