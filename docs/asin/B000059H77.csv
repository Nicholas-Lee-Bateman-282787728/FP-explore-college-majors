We see men training for combat. The Olympics were held in Munich in 1972. Security was kept lax. The Palestinians planned to attack on September 5. The East Germans allowed some Palestinians into the Olympic Village to scout the location. The Palestinians attacked and captured Israeli Olympians and offered to trade them for the release of Palestinians imprisoned in Israel. There was no deal. This event attracted international attention on television, radio, and newspapers. The German police tried to get information about the terrorists while delivering food, but failed. Solving this problem was left to the Germans. The Olympic Games were suspended.The deadline for a decision drew near. One athlete had been killed. German Border Guards were chosen for a surprise attack with machine guns on the Palestinians, but the order never came. This news was broadcast on television and the Palestinians were warned. They changed their demand for a jet plane that would take them and their Israeli prisoners to a friendly Arab country. The Germans planned to prevent this from happening. A Boeing 727 would be used as a decoy so snipers could shoot the terrorists at the airport in the open. But the Germans underestimated the number of terrorists. The lights went on and the shooting began. The snipers failed to shoot them all. The wrong men were shot! Armored cars were late in arriving. The first reports said all hostages were saved! This was soon corrected with the tragic results: none of the eleven hostages survived the attack. There was official mourning. Then the Games continued. The five dead Palestinians were sent to Libya. The three surviving terrorists were freed in exchange for a hijacked airliner. This was a conspiracy between the German government and the Palestinians.The German government formed an anti-terrorist unit. Israeli assassinated two of the surviving terrorists and some bystanders. The lone survivor survived attacks and lives in hiding somewhere in Africa with his wife and children.",5,The 1972 Munich Olympics,1343347200,"07 27, 2012",2012,2157,"['One', 'Day', 'September', '2000', 'filmIt', 'interview', 'widow', 'Next', 'Palestinian', 'revolutionary', 'who', 'still', 'hiding', 'see', 'men', 'training', 'combat', 'Olympics', 'were', 'held', 'Munich', '1972', 'Security', 'was', 'kept', 'lax', 'Palestinians', 'planned', 'attack', 'September', '5', 'East', 'Germans', 'allowed', 'Palestinians', 'Olympic', 'Village', 'scout', 'location', 'Palestinians', 'attacked', 'captured', 'Israeli', 'Olympians', 'offered', 'trade', 'release', 'Palestinians', 'imprisoned', 'Israel', 'was', 'deal', 'event', 'attracted', 'international', 'attention', 'television', 'radio', 'newspapers', 'German', 'police', 'tried', 'get', 'information', 'terrorists', 'delivering', 'food', 'failed', 'Solving', 'problem', 'was', 'left', 'Germans', 'Olympic', 'Games', 'were', 'suspended.The', 'deadline', 'decision', 'drew', 'near', 'One', 'athlete', 'had', 'been', 'killed', 'German', 'Border', 'Guards', 'were', 'chosen', 'surprise', 'attack', 'machine', 'guns', 'Palestinians', 'order', 'never', 'came', 'news', 'was', 'broadcast', 'television', 'Palestinians', 'were', 'warned', 'changed', 'demand', 'jet', 'plane', 'would', 'take', 'Israeli', 'prisoners', 'friendly', 'Arab', 'country', 'Germans', 'planned', 'prevent', 'happening', 'Boeing', '727', 'would', 'be', 'used', 'decoy', 'snipers', 'could', 'shoot', 'terrorists', 'airport', 'open', 'Germans', 'underestimated', 'number', 'terrorists', 'lights', 'went', 'shooting', 'began', 'snipers', 'failed', 'shoot', 'wrong', 'men', 'were', 'shot', 'Armored', 'cars', 'were', 'late', 'arriving', 'first', 'reports', 'said', 'hostages', 'were', 'saved', 'was', 'soon', 'corrected', 'tragic', 'results', 'none', 'eleven', 'hostages', 'survived', 'attack', 'was', 'official', 'mourning', 'Then', 'Games', 'continued', 'five', 'dead', 'Palestinians', 'were', 'sent', 'Libya', 'three', 'surviving', 'terrorists', 'were', 'freed', 'exchange', 'hijacked', 'airliner', 'was', 'conspiracy', 'German', 'government', 'Palestinians.The', 'German', 'government', 'formed', 'anti-terrorist', 'unit', 'Israeli', 'assassinated', 'two', 'surviving', 'terrorists', 'bystanders', 'lone', 'survivor', 'survived', 'attacks', 'lives', 'hiding', 'somewhere', 'Africa', 'wife', 'children']",One Day in September 1999

I'll never forget the image, shown on the cover of this DVD, when I came upon the 1972 Olympics in the book.  I was too young to remember it but this image has haunted me all my life.I had heard about this video and ran across it in my local video shop.  It was captivating.  It was horrible but I couldn't turn away.It begins with the human element, interviewing the wife of one of the Israeli athletes who was killed.  Also interviewed are German officials and other key players in the whole affair.  Perhaps most interesting is the interview with a surviving terrorist.  His points of view adds depth to the film and his final words will leave you thinking.I don't know much about the history of terrorism and the hijackings so prominent in their arsenal as a way of drawing international attention, but it seems to me this was perhaps the first in a very long chain of events drawing attention to the cause of the Palestinian people.Watch as it unfolds.  It is dramatic and not overly sensational and will leave you astounded.  I was not aware that there was such footage available.  It is as if it is happening live before your eyes.  I was enraged, embittered and deeply saddened by watching it but I believe watching something such as this is vital to see this to deepen our understanding of history lest we forget.",5,Everyone should see this film...,1038441600,"11 28, 2002",2002,1446,"['remember', 'aunt', 'buying', 'book', 'chronicled', 'Olympic', 'history', 'last', 'date', 'when', 'received', 'was', '1976', ""'ll"", 'never', 'forget', 'image', 'shown', 'cover', 'DVD', 'when', 'came', '1972', 'Olympics', 'book', 'was', 'too', 'young', 'remember', 'image', 'haunted', 'life.I', 'had', 'heard', 'video', 'ran', 'local', 'video', 'shop', 'was', 'captivating', 'was', 'horrible', 'could', ""n't"", 'turn', 'away.It', 'begins', 'human', 'element', 'interviewing', 'wife', 'one', 'Israeli', 'athletes', 'who', 'was', 'killed', 'Also', 'interviewed', 'are', 'German', 'officials', 'other', 'key', 'players', 'whole', 'affair', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'interesting', 'interview', 'surviving', 'terrorist', 'points', 'view', 'depth', 'film', 'final', 'words', 'will', 'leave', 'thinking.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'history', 'terrorism', 'hijackings', 'so', 'prominent', 'arsenal', 'way', 'drawing', 'international', 'attention', 'was', 'perhaps', 'first', 'very', 'long', 'chain', 'events', 'drawing', 'attention', 'cause', 'Palestinian', 'people.Watch', 'dramatic', 'not', 'overly', 'sensational', 'will', 'leave', 'astounded', 'was', 'not', 'aware', 'was', 'such', 'footage', 'available', 'happening', 'live', 'eyes', 'was', 'enraged', 'embittered', 'deeply', 'saddened', 'watching', 'believe', 'watching', 'something', 'such', 'vital', 'see', 'deepen', 'understanding', 'history', 'lest', 'forget']",One Day in September 1999

The Munich Massacre is described via the reflections of those who survived and remember the fallen. Here, technically, the film is flawless and Michael Douglas is a strong narrator. One of the wives of a slaughtered fencer ironically noted, ""This was what he always dreamed of,"" with the world coming together around the idea of sport, peace, and understanding. What he got was evil and West German government incompetence, but the world will always remember these games due to the way in which evil overtook them. Important political lessons are available from the event such as the futility of negotiating with terrorists and the foolishness of thinking that the show can go on while people are exterminated. How much of this event was the fault of the Germanys is not often considered, but the terrorists were given a tour of the village by the East Germans beforehand, and the Federal Republic did not have any armed police at the site or an assault squad available.

572395,A3SOV9HFM5H9T1,B000059H77,Bruce P. Barten,"[4, 6]","There are a number of amazing things in this video. This DVD dates back to a time when peaceful competition between national teams was what everyone expected in the Munich Olympic Games of 1972, and even the 1999 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature was before 9/11/2001 made the war on terrorism a daily concern for more people than had previously worried about how the rest of the world matters. Whoever expected to see a documentary in which a group of Germans decided that they were about to engage in a suicide mission and unanimously voted not to attempt what they had been planning to do? People who are inclined to keep track of how often governments lie might be interested in who first announced that the hostages had all been saved, and the terrorists killed. It becomes obvious during the film that one terrorist is still alive, on camera, and you can almost see who he is.The ending of the film was most remarkable for me. Some government maintains such close contact with the terrorist organizations that it was able, within a few weeks, to arrange a hijacking of a flight to Frankfurt that could be used as a cover for the release of the three survivors, in the interest of maintaining peace with the Palestinian cause for which an enormous amount of publicity had been generated by the event. Few will doubt that two of those survivors have probably died as a result of assassination teams, and it is likely that some government is keeping track of who has been getting killed, so the identity of the survivor at the end is only a secret for people who don't need to know. You can learn a lot else from watching this, and you can even listen to a few lines in German.  There might be German subtitles for people who know how to pick the setting.

572396,A3JPFWKS83R49V,B000059H77,"Bryan Carey ""Bryan Carey""","[7, 9]","The Olympic games are supposed to be a time when political differences are cast aside and people from different nations can join together in the spirit of competition. Most of the time, these international games can be counted for their objective and welcoming nature with minimal interference from outside factors.But in 1972, the Olympic world was shaken when three Palestinian terrorists held Israeli athletes hostage and eventually killed them all. This tragic moment is the main topic of this documentary, narrated by movie actor Michael Douglas. This documentary takes you behind the scenes, with footage from the actual siege, commentary from the news journalists who hoped the event could be settled peacefully, and comments from one of the actual terrorists himself, Jamal Al Gashey.This documentary lets the viewer see and hear what happened and it has some good educational value. I found out a few facts about this event that I hadn't heard before or had forgotten. The most significant of these facts was the fate of the three terrorists. They were detained in a German prison after the shooting spree, but they were later turned over to their homeland when a German airliner was hijacked and its terrorists demanded that the three Olympic terrorists be set free or else they would blow up the airliner. The German government gave in to their demands. This is unusual in and of itself, but the other circumstances make it seem even more unreal- almost like Germany orchestrated the entire event.To keep this documentary entertaining, like a movie, the director includes several classic rock tunes and there are many segments where all you see is a bunch of miscellaneous scenes and music playing. These scenes have little to do with the subject matter so I can only surmise that the director did this to make it seem more like a full, Hollywood production.These three terrorists were never brought to justice. They were turned over to their homeland where they undoubtedly received hero's welcomes. Jamal Al Gashey's role in this documentary is probably the most important part of the film because he explains, in his own cold, indifferent way, why he is proud of what he did and how it helped the Palestinian movement. His inclusion, alone, makes this documentary worth watching.The Olympic games are supposed to be free from political influence and for the most part, these ancient games achieve their goal and steer clear from this area of controversy. But every now and then, politics rears its ugly head. The 1972 Olympics is one of the most extreme examples of what can happen when militant individuals strike terror into the hearts and minds of innocent victims. And it makes this documentary one I recommend watching.",4,Terror in Munich Germany,1111449600,"03 22, 2005",2005,2738,"['Olympic', 'games', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'time', 'when', 'political', 'differences', 'are', 'cast', 'aside', 'people', 'different', 'nations', 'can', 'join', 'together', 'spirit', 'competition', 'Most', 'time', 'international', 'games', 'can', 'be', 'counted', 'objective', 'welcoming', 'nature', 'minimal', 'interference', 'outside', 'factors.But', '1972', 'Olympic', 'world', 'was', 'shaken', 'when', 'three', 'Palestinian', 'terrorists', 'held', 'Israeli', 'athletes', 'hostage', 'eventually', 'killed', 'tragic', 'moment', 'main', 'topic', 'documentary', 'narrated', 'movie', 'actor', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'documentary', 'scenes', 'footage', 'actual', 'siege', 'commentary', 'news', 'journalists', 'who', 'hoped', 'event', 'could', 'be', 'settled', 'peacefully', 'comments', 'one', 'actual', 'terrorists', 'Jamal', 'Al', 'Gashey.This', 'documentary', 'viewer', 'see', 'hear', 'what', 'happened', 'good', 'educational', 'value', 'found', 'out', 'few', 'facts', 'event', 'had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'had', 'forgotten', 'most', 'significant', 'facts', 'was', 'fate', 'three', 'terrorists', 'were', 'detained', 'German', 'prison', 'shooting', 'spree', 'were', 'later', 'turned', 'homeland', 'when', 'German', 'airliner', 'was', 'hijacked', 'terrorists', 'demanded', 'three', 'Olympic', 'terrorists', 'be', 'set', 'free', 'else', 'would', 'blow', 'up', 'airliner', 'German', 'government', 'gave', 'demands', 'unusual', 'other', 'circumstances', 'make', 'seem', 'even', 'more', 'unreal-', 'almost', 'Germany', 'orchestrated', 'entire', 'event.To', 'keep', 'documentary', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'director', 'several', 'classic', 'rock', 'tunes', 'are', 'many', 'segments', 'where', 'see', 'bunch', 'miscellaneous', 'scenes', 'music', 'playing', 'scenes', 'have', 'little', 'do', 'subject', 'matter', 'can', 'only', 'surmise', 'director', 'did', 'make', 'seem', 'more', 'full', 'Hollywood', 'production.These', 'three', 'terrorists', 'were', 'never', 'brought', 'justice', 'were', 'turned', 'homeland', 'where', 'undoubtedly', 'received', 'hero', 'welcomes', 'Jamal', 'Al', 'Gashey', 'role', 'documentary', 'probably', 'most', 'important', 'part', 'film', 'own', 'cold', 'indifferent', 'way', 'why', 'proud', 'what', 'did', 'how', 'helped', 'Palestinian', 'movement', 'inclusion', 'alone', 'documentary', 'worth', 'watching.The', 'Olympic', 'games', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'free', 'political', 'influence', 'most', 'part', 'ancient', 'games', 'achieve', 'goal', 'steer', 'clear', 'area', 'controversy', 'now', 'then', 'politics', 'rears', 'ugly', 'head', '1972', 'Olympics', 'one', 'most', 'extreme', 'examples', 'what', 'can', 'happen', 'when', 'militant', 'individuals', 'strike', 'terror', 'hearts', 'minds', 'innocent', 'victims', 'documentary', 'one', 'recommend', 'watching']",One Day in September 1999
572397,AGCOCRW8A56U8,B000059H77,buddyhead,"[43, 63]","An excellent documentary that demonstrates in crystal-clear fashion the danger that fundamentalist Muslims pose to the civilized world, and  how the Palestinians were every bit as cold-blooded, fanatical, and murderous as kidnappers in 1972 as they are today as homicide-bombers.  During the 1972 Munich Olympics, eight terrorists waltzed into the Olympic compound right under the nose of German authorities and held 11 Israeli athletes hostage, demanding that Israel release 200 terrorists held as prisoners.  Long story short, one hostage was shot in front of the others, one pitched out a window, and the rest were slaughtered at a German airport, in the terrorists' botched attempt to flee the country with the athletes  still captive.The film is as visually stimulating as it is informative.  The standoff and negotiations between the Palestinians and Germans were captured in their entirety on film, as was the ensuing journey to the airport; interspersed with the live footage were current news reports, including portions of the ABC sports broadcast and commentary about the scene at hand.  Anything not captured live on film was photographed, and the film's music was artfully chosen to convey the events' drama and anguish.  Amazingly, the sole surviving Palestinian terrorist was interviewed incognito for the film, who said about the initial hostage capture, ""I felt very proud that for the first time I was able to confront the Israelis.""  The shots of the slain athletes (both at the compound and the airport) are a brutal reminder of what the Palestinian idea of ""confronting"" innocents entails.One Day in September also shows that the Germans hadn't traveled very far from Nazism by 1972, except that their military ineptitude had grown in leaps and bounds.  Not only did the German police and Olympic authorities handle the crisis as effectively as a cross between Gilligan, Mr. Magoo, and Inspector Clousseau, but they were more concerned with continuing the games than they were with saving the lives of the hostages.  Furthermore, they held the Mossad at bay and prevented it from getting the job done; the Israeli squad, like so many others, was unfortunately initially fooled by what one called ""The Myth of Utter German Ruthless Efficiency.""German cluelessness and cowardice abounded: the police tried to raid the compound from the roof, only to learn just in time that the terrorists could watch their every move on live TV coverage;  agents got cold feet and bailed at the last second before descending on the terrorists; at the airport, they didn't even use real snipers, and had their men positioned in one another's lines of fire; one of the Germans accidentally shot a hostage.  In the interviews given by the Germans for the documentary (especially that of General Wegener), the tone can best be described as a shrug of the shoulders and a, ""Hey, what can you do?""  The greatest insult of is that the Germans allowed the three surviving terrorists to escape during their transport, as cowardly means of insurance against future acts of terrorism.  The terrorists received a hero's welcome in Libya.An amazingly sad story, captured as vividly as can be- One Day in September is the essence of what documentaries of historical events should be.  The only happy ending is that the Mossad later killed two out of the three terrorists- it's just too bad the remaining one couldn't have been shot in the face as soon as his interview for the project finished.",5,"""The Myth of Utter German Ruthless Efficiency""",1058140800,"07 14, 2003",2003,3483,"['excellent', 'documentary', 'crystal-clear', 'fashion', 'danger', 'fundamentalist', 'Muslims', 'pose', 'civilized', 'world', 'how', 'Palestinians', 'were', 'bit', 'cold-blooded', 'fanatical', 'murderous', 'kidnappers', '1972', 'are', 'today', 'homicide-bombers', '1972', 'Munich', 'Olympics', 'eight', 'terrorists', 'waltzed', 'Olympic', 'compound', 'right', 'nose', 'German', 'authorities', 'held', '11', 'Israeli', 'athletes', 'hostage', 'demanding', 'Israel', 'release', '200', 'terrorists', 'held', 'prisoners', 'Long', 'story', 'short', 'one', 'hostage', 'was', 'shot', 'front', 'others', 'one', 'pitched', 'out', 'window', 'rest', 'were', 'slaughtered', 'German', 'airport', 'terrorists', 'botched', 'attempt', 'flee', 'country', 'athletes', 'still', 'captive.The', 'film', 'visually', 'stimulating', 'informative', 'standoff', 'negotiations', 'Palestinians', 'Germans', 'were', 'captured', 'entirety', 'film', 'was', 'ensuing', 'journey', 'airport', 'interspersed', 'live', 'footage', 'were', 'current', 'news', 'reports', 'including', 'portions', 'ABC', 'sports', 'broadcast', 'commentary', 'scene', 'hand', 'Anything', 'not', 'captured', 'live', 'film', 'was', 'photographed', 'film', 'music', 'was', 'artfully', 'chosen', 'convey', 'events', 'drama', 'anguish', 'Amazingly', 'sole', 'surviving', 'Palestinian', 'terrorist', 'was', 'interviewed', 'incognito', 'film', 'who', 'said', 'initial', 'hostage', 'capture', 'felt', 'very', 'proud', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'able', 'confront', 'Israelis', 'shots', 'slain', 'athletes', 'compound', 'airport', 'are', 'brutal', 'reminder', 'what', 'Palestinian', 'idea', 'confronting', 'innocents', 'entails.One', 'Day', 'September', 'also', 'Germans', 'had', ""n't"", 'traveled', 'very', 'far', 'Nazism', '1972', 'military', 'ineptitude', 'had', 'grown', 'leaps', 'bounds', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'German', 'police', 'Olympic', 'authorities', 'handle', 'crisis', 'as', 'effectively', 'cross', 'Gilligan', 'Mr.', 'Magoo', 'Inspector', 'Clousseau', 'were', 'more', 'concerned', 'continuing', 'games', 'were', 'saving', 'lives', 'hostages', 'Furthermore', 'held', 'Mossad', 'bay', 'prevented', 'getting', 'job', 'done', 'Israeli', 'squad', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'was', 'unfortunately', 'initially', 'fooled', 'what', 'one', 'called', 'Myth', 'Utter', 'German', 'Ruthless', 'Efficiency', 'German', 'cluelessness', 'cowardice', 'abounded', 'police', 'tried', 'raid', 'compound', 'roof', 'only', 'learn', 'just', 'time', 'terrorists', 'could', 'watch', 'move', 'live', 'TV', 'coverage', 'agents', 'got', 'cold', 'feet', 'bailed', 'last', 'second', 'descending', 'terrorists', 'airport', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'use', 'real', 'snipers', 'had', 'men', 'positioned', 'one', 'lines', 'fire', 'one', 'Germans', 'accidentally', 'shot', 'hostage', 'interviews', 'given', 'Germans', 'documentary', 'especially', 'General', 'Wegener', 'tone', 'can', 'best', 'be', 'described', 'shrug', 'shoulders', 'Hey', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'greatest', 'insult', 'Germans', 'allowed', 'three', 'surviving', 'terrorists', 'escape', 'transport', 'cowardly', 'means', 'insurance', 'future', 'acts', 'terrorism', 'terrorists', 'received', 'hero', 'welcome', 'Libya.An', 'amazingly', 'sad', 'story', 'captured', 'as', 'vividly', 'can', 'be-', 'One', 'Day', 'September', 'essence', 'what', 'documentaries', 'historical', 'events', 'should', 'be', 'only', 'happy', 'ending', 'Mossad', 'later', 'killed', 'two', 'three', 'terrorists-', 'just', 'too', 'bad', 'remaining', 'one', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'shot', 'face', 'as', 'soon', 'interview', 'project', 'finished']",One Day in September 1999

This documentary will do more than a thousand blind men can tell you about what racism, race-hatred, genocide, cold-blooded murder, and geopolotics are about.  It will be difficult watching for early teen-agers, but then again, with what we see on cable TV today, I could be wrong even about that.I can see many uses for this film, but especially for young men involved in--yes, really--sports.  Gang-bangers, Boy Scouts, you name it.  It is about male competition and hormones gone awry, which happens so frequently these days and throughout history one would think there would need to be no more books, no more videos, nothing more to say about it.  However, as this documentary shows, there is more to say--even from Hollywood.I have only one quarrel with the documentary.  I believe (and from other sources I believe this to be factual) that the Israelis did NOT simply sit in the helicopters--they fought back when the opportunity presented itself.  Many think today (2006) that Israel has lost its will to fight.

572400,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,B000059H77,Erik North,"[0, 0]","On September 5, 1972, in an ordeal that lasted into the early morning hours of the following day, the Olympic ideal was brutally attacked when members of a shadow Palestinian terrorist group known as Black September hopped over the fence at the Olympic Village in Munich and killed two Israeli athletes, holding nine others hostage and threatening to kill them unless their demands for freeing two hundred political prisoners were met.  With Israel point-blank refusing to negotiate, and having to take responsibility for this, a rag-tag German hit squad unleashed their firepower on the terrorists at the Furstenfeldbruck airfield just outside of Munich; and although three of the eight terrorists were eventually captured and the other five died in the melee, so too did the remaining nine Israeli athletes.  It was the first act of terrorism ever televised to an international audience; and in 1999, it was the focus of the Oscar-winning documentary ONE DAY IN SEPTEMBER.Narrated by Michael Douglas, ONE DAY IN SEPTEMBER examines, in a span of only ninety-one minutes, the way the 1972 Summer Olympics were laid out, and how it led to what took place.  Munich was, just four decades before, the epicenter of the Nazi movement; and when it was awarded the '72 Games, memories of Hitler's 1936 Berlin Games, as well as the horrors of World War II and the Holocaust, were still fresh in the population's memories.  The organizers of Munich '72 were determined to make it as different from ""Hitler's Games"" as was humanly possible; and while theirs were noble and good intentions, it turned out to be their undoing.  The perimeter of the Olympic Village was a mere rusty fence, as opposed to sturdier materials like barbed wire (so as not to look like a concentration camp like Dachau, which was only seven miles away), and the security guards not only had no visible firearms on them, but they also didn't even look like security guards to begin with.  This was how the eight Black September militants scaled the fence, with the unintentional help of drunken American athletes, and broke into the Israeli apartment at Connollystrasse 31.  A great deal of negotiating between West Germany and Black September ensued, and the world was transfixed to their televisions, as they watched what had been up to that moment a peaceful Olympic celebration suddenly turned into the most overt act of terrorism the world had seen to that point.Attempts by the West German government to end the standoff by force were totally unsuccessful (the country had no counter-terrorism force of its own, and relied on municipal cops); and when the terrorists and the hostages were transported by helicopters to Furstenfeldbruck, the situation took the ultimate horrifying turn.  A whole horde of untrained German snipers unloaded on the airfield; and over the next forty-five minutes, all hell broke loose.  Once the melee was over, officials of the West German government and the Munich Olympic Committee had stated that the terrorists had been killed, but the Israelis had been saved.  Later on, of course, it was revealed that something totally different had transpired.  It was up to ABC sportscaster Jim McKay to deliver the terrible news to the world: ""They're all gone.""People who remember those two terrible days in September 1972 will certainly be reminded of them again when watching ONE DAY IN SEPTEMBER; and those who only know of 9/11 will be reminded of how terrorism turned good things bad in a hurry long before that.  The whole ordeal, down to the last horrifying battle at Furstenfeldbruck, was an act of well-meant but painfully inept West German planning; and while the decision to go on with the Olympic Games after the deaths may have been a way of both paying tribute to the murdered Israelis and thumbing its noses at terrorists, it was also extremely controversial.  Scenes of athletic competition, including those of U.S. swimmer Mark Spitz and Russian gymnast Olga Korbut, are interspersed with the horrific events at Connollystrasse 31 to emphasize the tragic turn Munch '72 took in the span of only eighteen hours.  The mood is emphasized further by Heffes' modern score, with contributions by Philip Glass, Led Zeppelin (""The Immigrant Song""), Apollo 100 (""Joy""), and a performance of the Funeral March of Beethoven's Eroica Symphony, as performed by Rudolf Kempe and the Munich Philharmonic at the memorial for the athletes.  In the end, ONE DAY IN SEPTEMBER was richly deserving of the Oscar it got, and it should remind us all of how political terrorism not only poisoned the ultimate sporting event, but also led to far worse things to come.",5,Revisiting The Munich Tragedy,1346889600,"09 6, 2012",2012,4653,"['September', '5', '1972', 'ordeal', 'lasted', 'early', 'morning', 'hours', 'following', 'day', 'Olympic',

On September 5, 1972, eight Palestinian terrorists stormed the Olympic Village and killed two Israelis athletes and took another nine Israelis hostage.  This began the standoff between the German police and the terrorists.The documentary starts by letting us know who some of the victims are (though, I suppose if you had no idea what this was about you wouldn't know they were the future victims).  The film focuses on one particular Israeli and his wife speaks about him and what kind of man he was.  We also get the perspective of Jamal al-Gashey, one of the terrorists.  He speaks on camera (though obscured by lack of light) about the planning for the incident.  The documentary then tells us about the hopes for the Munich games, the first Olympic games since the 1932 Berlin games when Hitler was the host.  The hope was that the games could be a reconciliation after World War II.  But then the attack occurred and the standoff began.From the start, nothing went right.  ""One Day in September"" shows the ineptitude of the German police throughout the event.  One example is that the police put together a task force to rescue the hostages at the Olympic village.  Sounds great, but they were doing it in daylight and there were television crews covering the standoff and they barely realized in time that every room in the Olympic village had a television and the terrorists were likely watching every move the police made.  It got worse from there.  It wasn't until the final rescue attempt at the airport that the ineptitude reached a critical level.  I couldn't believe how many things were not taken into consideration, such as the sniper team had no communication with the police so they did not know how many terrorists there were, and two of the snipers didn't have helmets or bulletproof vests so they were pinned down and couldn't take a shot.I have two main thoughts running through my head about this film.  The subject of the film is fascinating.  This is something that I want to know about and it is a huge moment in Olympic history (and gets alluded to in the two Steve Prefontaine movies).  The other thought is that while the subject was incredibly interesting and the movie won the 1999 Academy Award for Best Documentary, I don't feel that it was as well made as it could have been.  The documentary was somewhat boring, very slow moving (a documentary can move at a swift pace even for an event covering a short period of time), and was not very engaging.  It is a movie that I wanted to like, but I think it was only average.  It lingered too long at times and did not move on in telling the story fast enough.",3,"fascinating subject, disappointing documentary",1077667200,"02 25, 2004",2004,2795,"['film', 'Kevin', 'MacDonald', 'One', 'Day', 'September', 'documentary', 'film', 'dealing', 'terrorist', 'attack', '1972', 'Olympic', 'Games', 'held', 'Munich', 'Germany', 'September', '5', '1972', 'eight', 'Palestinian', 'terrorists', 'stormed', 'Olympic', 'Village', 'killed', 'two', 'Israelis', 'athletes', 'took', 'nine', 'Israelis', 'hostage', 'began', 'standoff', 'German', 'police', 'terrorists.The', 'documentary', 'starts', 'letting', 'know', 'who', 'victims', 'are', 'suppose', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'were', 'future', 'victims', 'film', 'one', 'particular', 'Israeli', 'wife', 'speaks', 'what', 'kind', 'man', 'was', 'also', 'get', 'perspective', 'Jamal', 'al-Gashey', 'one', 'terrorists', 'camera', 'obscured', 'lack', 'light', 'planning', 'incident', 'documentary', 'then', 'hopes', 'Munich', 'games', 'first', 'Olympic', 'games', '1932', 'Berlin', 'games', 'when', 'Hitler', 'was', 'host', 'hope', 'was', 'games', 'could', 'be', 'reconciliation', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'then', 'attack', 'occurred', 'standoff', 'start', 'nothing', 'went', 'right', 'One', 'Day', 'September', 'ineptitude', 'German', 'police', 'event', 'One', 'example', 'police', 'put', 'together', 'task', 'force', 'rescue', 'hostages', 'Olympic', 'village', 'great', 'were', 'doing', 'daylight', 'were', 'television', 'crews', 'covering', 'standoff', 'barely', 'realized', 'time', 'room', 'Olympic', 'village', 'had', 'television', 'terrorists', 'were', 'likely', 'watching', 'move', 'police', 'made', 'got', 'worse', 'there', 'was', ""n't"", 'final', 'rescue', 'attempt', 'airport', 'ineptitude', 'reached', 'critical', 'level', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'how', 'many', 'things', 'were', 'not', 'taken', 'consideration', 'such', 'sniper', 'team', 'had', 'communication', 'police', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'many', 'terrorists', 'were', 'two', 'snipers', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'helmets', 'bulletproof', 'vests', 'were', 'pinned', 'down', 'could', ""n't"", 'take', 'shot.I', 'have', 'two', 'main', 'thoughts', 'running', 'head', 'film', 'subject', 'film', 'fascinating', 'something', 'want', 'know', 'huge', 'moment', 'Olympic', 'history', 'alluded', 'two', 'Steve', 'Prefontaine', 'movies', 'other', 'thought', 'subject', 'was', 'incredibly', 'interesting', 'movie', 'won', '1999', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Documentary', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'as', 'well', 'made', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'documentary', 'was', 'somewhat', 'boring', 'very', 'slow', 'moving', 'documentary', 'can', 'move', 'swift', 'pace', 'even', 'event', 'covering', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'engaging', 'movie', 'wanted', 'like', 'think', 'was', 'only', 'average', 'lingered', 'too', 'long', 'times', 'did', 'not', 'move', 'telling', 'story', 'fast', 'enough']",One Day in September 1999

""One Day in September"" depicts the tragic hostage crisis at the 1972 Munich Olympics.  Among those interviewed is the one surviving terrorist, who describes his training and how thrilled he felt to be doing something for Palestine.The recollections of Ankie Spritzer, widow of the Israeli fencing coach, particularly make the viewer experience the horror of having a loved one held captive.  Mrs. Spritzer describes how she wondered whether her husband was alive or dead when the news reported than an unnamed hostage had been murdered, and later, her elation at reports that the remaining hostages were safe at the airport, and finally, how she received the horrible news that the rescue attempt had gone terribly wrong.  Seeing the daughters who grew up never knowing their fathers brings home the continuing sadness of this event.Kevin Macdonald's documentary also includes an interview with the head of the Massad who was denied permission to send in an Israeli rescue team and was assured that the Germans could manage the situation.  The Massad chief bitterly recalls the numerous unthinkable errors that the Germans made: Extremely light security to avoid the impression of being heavy handed.  Failing to seal off the Olympic Village from news crews, which resulted in tipping off the terrorists when an early rescue attempt was broadcast on live TV.  Underestimating the number of terrorists and placing insufficient sharpshooters at the airport when the terrorists were allowed to leave with the hostages.  Lack of radio communication, rescuers without bulletproof vests and helmets, failure to order the armored cars that were planned to transport the hostages to safety once the ""commando"" team went into action,....  The ""commando"" team actually was made up of police officers who volunteered and stated that they were familiar with using firearms--not a specially trained unit.Most interviewed concluded that the German and Olympic officials were more interseted in resuming the Olympic Games than in rescuing the hostages.  In fact, the Olympic officials initially didn't hault the games, despite the early deaths of two hostages.The three terrorists who survived the assault at the airport never stood trial.

I needn't worry about revealing ""spoilers"" in this review, since probably anyone who would have an interest in seeing this film already knows its horrendous outcome.I have a great love of historical dramas - ""Titanic"" and ""JFK"" are among my favorite films - but unlike these (and the earlier docudrama ""21 Hours At Munich""), this film has much more to offer - specifically, the perspectives of those parties directly involved. The relatives of Andre Spitzer and Jacov Springer give voice to the dead (although, truthfully, I would like to have heard from the other families - Ankie Spitzer, while a great lady, is interviewed EVERY time this subject comes up). In a real coup for the producers and director of this film, the last survivor of the Munich murderers, Jamal Al-Gashey, crawled out of hiding long enough to proudly recount the deeds of his terrorist compatriots (A question - why is this man still alive? Mossad, where ARE you?). Several of the German police and government officials speak about their attempts to resolve the crisis without (for the most part) shirking their responsibility for the tragic ending (although one will be quite off-put by General Wegener's seeming callousness and the Keystone Kops-like bungling in general).Newsreel footage brings the events of 1972 back to life in all its' horrendous flower.

(There were far too many other things to do).  I saw ""Apollo 13"" and wondered, Wow! When did that happen?  Of course, when I realized it was during that time frame, I understood just how cut off I was.  The Munich Olympics did not entirely escape my attention but I wasn't exactly an expert on the subject either.  That is why I enjoyed the documentary ""One Day in September"" recently.  I knew the basics but I hadn't realized that the whole story had so much more to it.In ""One Day in September"", we are giving a step by step account of exactly what DID happen in Munich.  In fact, after a good background intro, the film shows us the exact time of each incident or event as they ocurred.  Much of the action (and inaction) is documented with newsreel footage of the times.  There are a number of eyewitness interviews many of which appeared to have been conducted later for this film.  The narration is limited and seems to have been used only to bridge sequences and/or inform us of background activities not otherwise documented by film or interview.  Most of the information I saw I either never knew or had long forgotten.  I am glad that I saw this film because I won't forget this again.The film, I believe, actually opens with an on-camera interview with one of the perpetrators which had the eerie effect of letting us know that there was some element of ""success"" for the terrorists.  The interview with this individual is interspliced throughout the movie and is quite helpful (although it may be bothersome to some that he survived the terrorist action).  There are a number of interviews with German officials who seemed to have a knack for phrasing things in just the wrong way.  Indeed, I recalled that the German government came off looking bad but I'd forgotten or didn't know just how bad.  Things just seemed to get worse and worse largely due to the ineptitude of the German authorities.Documentaries are often seen and then forgotten.

Not only in the horrendous arc of world wide anti-semitism, and anti-Zionism, but also in who is implicated as a guilty party in the tragedy of the 1972 Olympics.The events of 1972 are far enough in the past that there are generations of young adults who would probably identify &quot;Black September&quot; as a rock&amp;roll band.  That means that though there are many of us who know the history full well, there are also many who will be riveted by a story well told with plot twists that should only be found in a mass market thriller.  Twists that might be brilliant if they weren't sadly true.  I'll give nothing away but to say the Germans, East/West/and United; and the Olympic Organizers played their roles as if Hitler won.

Pichlik ""EWTN fan""","[3, 3]","I recently saw this film on Bravo, and after viewing it immediately went online to Amazon to see if it was availble on DVD; it was, and I ordered it.  I was only 10 years old when these events took place, and had only a vague recollection that something ""bad"" happened.  To see the complete and total ineffectiveness and incompetence exhibited by the Germans in dealing with this crisis would be almost laughable if it hadn't produced such catastrophic and appalling results.  I realize that at the time we in the west were relatively ""newcomers"" to terrorism and terrorist activities, but we were hardly babes in the woods.  The idea that the Germans would refuse Israeli assistance when they had absolutely no idea of how to deal with this type of situation strikes one as though it must have been driven by pure ego.  This film demonstrates in an unapologetic and unabashed way in microcosm what we are confronted with in the world today; emboldened Islamo-fascists who will demand 100% complete submission, surrender and conversion or your death.  There was no negotiating with these extremists back in 1972 and if anything the situation has deteriorated.  If there was a lesson that was learned from this tragedy it is that Germany formed GSG9, (their specialized anti-terrorist squad), as did many other western countries in the aftermath of this murderous catastrophe.  That is small comfort I suspect, though, to the families and loved ones who paid the ultimate price to teach us this lesson.  Golda Meir is quoted as having said ""until they love their children, more than they hate us, we will not have peace"".  Today, we all can utter this quote with equal applicability.By the way, before anyone might be tempted allege that I am Jewish and merely spouting rhetoric I am a Catholic-American of French, Lithuanian, Czech descent.One last question that I have maybe someone can help me with.

572420,A3CH1KT8XQE8SA,B000059H77,"S. Calhoun ""rhymeswithorange""","[10, 11]","ONE DAY IN SEPTEMBER is an intriguing documentary covering the brutal killings of eleven Israeli athletes by a radical Palestinian terrorism group at the 1972 Olympic Games held in Munich, Germany. First-rate film archives of the unfolding drama are shown throughout this film and are interspersed with present-day interviews of numerous individuals directly involved, including the sole remaining terrorist who remains in hiding to this day in fear of Israeli assassination squads. Although the ending is not a secret I found this film to be gripping and suspenseful.One of the most compelling aspects of this film pertains to how Germany failed repeatedly to effectively protect the athletes and to successfully rescue the hostages. Participating in the 1972 Olympic Games was a momentous symbolic measure for Israel as German-Jewish relations remained sore nearly three decades after the collapse of Nazi Germany. Security surrounding the Olympic Village was intentionally relaxed and the guards did not carry guns. This apparent loophole enabled the terrorists to infiltrate the Israeli housing complex and carry out their treats to the vicious end.Watching this documentary is very timely considering present-day political situations in the Middle East and the upcoming summer Olympics in Athens, Greece. It is my dear hope that the Greeks will learn from the mistakes of the Germans and protect all the athletes and spectators from harm. The camaraderie and spirit of the Olympics should not be overshadowed by acts of terrorism. It's sobering to realize that 30 years later the Palestinian-Israeli conflict remains in the headlines and claims countless of lives.

As an adult, there are many aspects I still can't understand:  The callousness of the Olympic Committee; the blundering of the German officials; the monstrous irresponsibility of the media; the joyous celebration of the Palestinians when the bodies of their &quot;heroes&quot; returned home; the enduring pride of the remaining terrorist, now a husband and father, in the role he played.  Several times, overwhelmed by my own emotions of anger and frustration, I had to stop the video and take a breather.What I felt was missing was a deeper explanation as to why the Palestinian &quot;Black September&quot; group felt compelled to act as they did.  I don't think I will ever be able to empathize with people who kill unarmed civilians, but I would at least like a better understanding, if possible, of their motivations.

572422,A1ZO6CTEH4R4Z3,B000059H77,Stephen F. Davids,"[3, 5]","It's not that this documentary is bad in any way, just that it's only okay.  If you are looking for an introduction to this event, Aaron Klein's excellent book ""Striking Back"" is much more cogently presented.  Anyone who has read ""Striking Back"" will learn very little new information here.  My greatest reservation about this documentary is that it is too short.  Had I not already known the names of the key players, especially on the German side, I would have found the exposition very confusing.  The talking head interview subjects are not adequately identified.  More time should have been spent on the bureaucratic problems between federal German officials and local Bavarian authorities.  On the positive side, most of the massive German failures are accurately captured here.For some reason, the film doesn't mention Ankie Spitzer's decades-long struggle to learn the truth of what occurred from recalcitrant German officials.  This is especially odd in that her story is prominently featured.  Extensive time is spent on admittedly very moving recollections of family members, but it comes across as a too-easy appeal to our emotions in a film that should be dedicated to exposing the tragedies that compounded the tragedy of the terrorist attack.  Those who unfairly criticize Spielberg's ""Munich"" for not being sufficiently sympathetic with the victims will find what they are looking for right here.One virtue of this film is an extensive interview with one of the surviving terrorists, and to its credit the film does not indulge in any cheap tricks to make him look more evil than he already is, and for the most part presents his story objectively, allowing his acts to speak for themselves.  One side note is that the film identifies him as the only surviving terrorist, whereas Klein's research in ""Striking Back"" raises the very real likelihood that two of the terrorist are still alive, dispelling the popularly-held myth that Mossad killed all of them.  As Klein effectively proves (and as ""Munich"" accurately presents), those initially killed by Israeli assassins in retribution for Munich were by and large low-level operatives who took no security precautions whatever (the Spring of Youth killings in Beiruit being an exception, as well as the later killing of Ali Hassan Salameh).  ""One Day in September"" also gets high marks for objectivity, observing at the end that Israeli operatives killed several people whom they believed were involved in Munich, and Klein's book now proves that this involvement was often extremely attenuated.The film also takes a strong position that the Olympics should have been canceled or otherwise suspended, but I think that question is not so simple.  At what point does the refusal to continue with planned activities only give the terrorists a greater sense of self-importance and accomplishment?  However, the scenes of athletes chatting and sunbathing in the Olympic village while the Israelis were held at gunpoint only a few hundred feet away were just as chilling as they were at the time on live TV.What was needed here was less emotionalism and more rigorous analysis of what went wrong and why.",3,A Dissenting Voice,1141516800,"03 5, 2006",2006,3164,"['not', 'documentary', 'bad', 'way', 'just', 'only', 'okay', 'are', 'looking', 'introduction', 'event', 'Aaron', 'Klein', 'excellent', 'book', 'Striking', 'Back', 'much', 'more', 'cogently', 'presented', 'Anyone', 'who', 'read', 'Striking', 'Back', 'will', 'learn', 'very', 'little', 'new', 'information', 'here', 'greatest', 'reservation', 'documentary', 'too', 'short', 'Had', 'not', 'already', 'known', 'names', 'key', 'players', 'especially', 'German', 'side', 'would', 'have', 'found', 'exposition', 'very', 'confusing', 'talking', 'head', 'interview', 'subjects', 'are', 'not', 'adequately', 'identified', 'More', 'time', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'spent', 'bureaucratic', 'problems', 'federal', 'German', 'officials', 'local', 'Bavarian', 'authorities', 'positive', 'side', 'most', 'massive', 'German', 'failures', 'are', 'accurately', 'captured', 'here.For', 'reason', 'film', ""n't"", 'mention', 'Ankie', 'Spitzer', 'decades-long', 'struggle', 'learn', 'truth', 'what', 'occurred', 'recalcitrant', 'German', 'officials', 'especially', 'odd', 'story', 'prominently', 'featured', 'Extensive', 'time', 'spent', 'admittedly', 'very', 'moving', 'recollections', 'family', 'members', 'too-easy', 'appeal', 'emotions', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'dedicated', 'exposing', 'tragedies', 'compounded', 'tragedy', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'who', 'unfairly', 'criticize', 'Spielberg', 'Munich', 'not', 'being', 'sufficiently', 'sympathetic', 'victims', 'will', 'find', 'what', 'are', 'looking', 'right', 'here.One', 'virtue', 'film', 'extensive', 'interview', 'one', 'surviving', 'terrorists', 'credit', 'film', 'not', 'indulge', 'cheap', 'tricks', 'make', 'look', 'more', 'evil', 'already', 'most', 'part', 'story', 'objectively', 'allowing', 'acts', 'speak', 'One', 'side', 'note', 'film', 'only', 'surviving', 'terrorist', 'Klein', 'research', 'Striking', 'Back', 'very', 'real', 'likelihood', 'two', 'terrorist', 'are', 'still', 'alive', 'dispelling', 'popularly-held', 'myth', 'Mossad', 'killed', 'Klein', 'effectively', 'Munich', 'accurately', 'initially', 'killed', 'Israeli', 'assassins', 'retribution', 'Munich', 'were', 'large', 'low-level', 'operatives', 'who', 'took', 'security', 'precautions', 'Spring', 'Youth', 'killings', 'Beiruit', 'being', 'exception', 'as', 'well', 'later', 'killing', 'Ali', 'Hassan', 'Salameh', 'One', 'Day', 'September', 'also', 'high', 'marks', 'objectivity', 'observing', 'end', 'Israeli', 'killed', 'several', 'people', 'whom', 'believed', 'were', 'involved', 'Munich', 'Klein', 'book', 'now', 'involvement', 'was', 'often', 'extremely', 'attenuated.The', 'film', 'also', 'strong', 'position', 'Olympics', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'canceled', 'otherwise', 'suspended', 'think', 'question', 'not', 'so', 'simple', 'what', 'point', 'refusal', 'continue', 'planned', 'activities', 'only', 'give', 'terrorists', 'greater', 'sense', 'self-importance', 'accomplishment', 'However', 'scenes', 'athletes', 'chatting', 'sunbathing', 'Olympic', 'village', 'Israelis', 'were', 'held', 'gunpoint', 'only', 'few', 'hundred', 'feet', 'away', 'were', 'just', 'as', 'chilling', 'were', 'time', 'live', 'TV.What', 'was', 'needed', 'here', 'was', 'less', 'emotionalism', 'more', 'rigorous', 'analysis', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'why']",One Day in September 1999

However anyone feels about the conflict in the Middle East, these athletes were innocent, unarmed, defenseless civilians. Funny that is, how all the terrorist acts around the world, murdering thousands of innocent civilians, have always been executed by Arab extremists. Never Israelis. Not once. The cowardice of a bunch of armed thugs ""capturing"" unarmed people in their beds, and being treated as  ""heroes"" for doing so, sickened me. They are liars as well, since they said that they didn't intend to kill anyone unless they ""had"" to, and the first killing was immediate, with the threat then of one hostage executed per hour. What was even more sickening was the fact that the Games were not immediately halted. First, seeing all those people sunbathing, playing ping pong, etc only feet away from the room where the hostages were held, waiting to die, reminded me of pictures I have seen of Germans lounging in cafes, laughing, while the noose tightened around the necks of Jews all around them. Who could be entertaining themselves while this was happening? Then, the fact that the Games were not immediately halted was unbelievable. I know what was said about the reasons why they weren't, but that is meaningless. I know the other athletes had been training for years, but how could they go on with their contests while their fellow Olympians' lives had already been taken, with others' hanging in the balance? Does being an Olympian mean you don't have to be a human being? The thing that kept resounding to me, throughout the film, unspoken but louder than anything else, was ""who cares. It's just Jews.""I was thinking about the fact that there have been Olympic Games for a hundred years, and nothing like this has ever happened before or since. Not once was in mentioned in the film that the ONLY time this has ever happened was to an Israeli team, in Germany. No one thinks this is quite a coincidence? I don't think it is coincidence at all. All the egregious errors made by the German police made them look like Keystone Kops, and still no one drew the conclusion that the bumbling was intentional,that they had no desire to and no intention of saving the Jews, so they didn't? Germans are not bumbling or sloppy. They executed two world wars on multiple fronts and developed extremely efficient death factories, killing millions of people, yet they are powerless in the face of less than TEN terrorists, and unable to rescue TEN people in the apartment? It showed the guys filming the ""surprise attack,"" yet no one stopped them or would know that the rooms had televisions, and therefore the terrorists would also see them? No one on the police force had guns or knew how to shoot them? The list goes on and on. The terrorist said that the East German team helped them to plan the way in. I am convinced that the Olympic Committee and Germany either knew this was going to happen or chose to do nothing when it did happen. The hijacking/prisoner exchange was shown to be bogus, and the Germans complicit. I am convinced they were complicit in the murders of the Israeli team as well, and that the blood of those Jews continues to be on their hands. They should have been banned from ever being able to host or compete again. To have had criminal charges to be brought was too much to hope for, since the terrorists themselves were never even charged. It was true after the war and still true, that you will get off scot free if you kill Jews.Who was the bastard that was laughing?",4,Heartbreaking,1348185600,"09 21, 2012",2012,3653,"['just', 'saw', 'film', 'again', 'reading', 'reviews', 'here', 'am', 'saddened', 'find', 'antisemitism', 'was', 'prevalent', 'film', 'alive', 'well', 'here', 'too', 'However', 'anyone', 'feels', 'conflict', 'Middle', 'East', 'athletes', 'were', 'innocent', 'unarmed', 'defenseless', 'civilians', 'Funny', 'how', 'terrorist', 'acts', 'world', 'murdering', 'thousands', 'innocent', 'civilians', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'executed', 'Arab', 'extremists', 'Never', 'Israelis', 'Not', 'once', 'cowardice', 'bunch', 'armed', 'thugs', 'capturing', 'unarmed', 'people', 'beds', 'being', 'treated', 'heroes', 'doing', 'so', 'sickened', 'are', 'liars', 'as', 'well', 'said', 'did', ""n't"", 'intend', 'kill', 'anyone', 'had', 'first', 'killing', 'was', 'immediate', 'threat', 'then', 'one', 'hostage', 'executed', 'hour', 'What', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'sickening', 'was', 'fact', 'Games', 'were', 'not', 'immediately', 'halted', 'First', 'seeing', 'people', 'sunbathing', 'playing', 'ping', 'pong', 'etc', 'only', 'feet', 'away', 'room', 'where', 'hostages', 'were', 'held', 'waiting', 'die', 'reminded', 'pictures', 'have', 'seen', 'Germans', 'lounging', 'cafes', 'laughing', 'noose', 'tightened', 'necks', 'Jews', 'Who', 'could', 'be', 'entertaining', 'was', 'happening', 'Then', 'fact', 'Games', 'were', 'not', 'immediately', 'halted', 'was', 'unbelievable', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'said', 'reasons', 'why', 'were', ""n't"", 'meaningless', 'know', 'other', 'athletes', 'had', 'been', 'training', 'years', 'how', 'could', 'go', 'contests', 'fellow', 'Olympians', 'lives', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'taken', 'others', 'hanging', 'balance', 'Does', 'being', 'Olympian', 'mean', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'human', 'being', 'thing', 'kept', 'resounding', 'film', 'unspoken', 'louder', 'anything', 'else', 'was', 'who', 'just', 'Jews', 'was', 'thinking', 'fact', 'have', 'been', 'Olympic', 'Games', 'hundred', 'years', 'nothing', 'ever', 'happened', 'Not', 'once', 'was', 'mentioned', 'film', 'ONLY', 'time', 'ever', 'happened', 'was', 'Israeli', 'team', 'Germany', 'one', 'quite', 'coincidence', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'coincidence', 'egregious', 'errors', 'made', 'German', 'police', 'made', 'look', 'Keystone', 'Kops', 'still', 'one', 'drew', 'conclusion', 'bumbling', 'was', 'intentional', 'had', 'desire', 'intention', 'saving', 'Jews', 'did', ""n't"", 'Germans', 'are', 'not', 'bumbling', 'sloppy', 'executed', 'two', 'world', 'wars', 'multiple', 'fronts', 'developed', 'extremely', 'efficient', 'death', 'factories', 'killing', 'millions', 'people', 'yet', 'are', 'powerless', 'face', 'less', 'TEN', 'terrorists', 'unable', 'rescue', 'TEN', 'people', 'apartment', 'showed', 'guys', 'filming', 'surprise', 'attack', 'yet', 'one', 'stopped', 'would', 'know', 'rooms', 'had', 'televisions', 'therefore', 'terrorists', 'would', 'also', 'see', 'one', 'police', 'force', 'had', 'guns', 'knew', 'how', 'shoot', 'list', 'terrorist', 'said', 'East', 'German', 'team', 'helped', 'plan', 'way', 'am', 'convinced', 'Olympic', 'Committee', 'Germany', 'either', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'chose', 'do', 'nothing', 'when', 'did', 'happen', 'hijacking/prisoner', 'exchange', 'was', 'shown', 'be', 'bogus', 'Germans', 'complicit', 'am', 'convinced', 'were', 'complicit', 'murders', 'Israeli', 'team', 'as', 'well', 'blood', 'Jews', 'be', 'hands', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'banned', 'ever', 'being', 'able', 'host', 'compete', 'again', 'have', 'had', 'criminal', 'charges', 'be', 'brought', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'hope', 'terrorists', 'were', 'never', 'even', 'charged', 'was', 'true', 'war', 'still', 'true', 'will', 'get', 'off', 'scot', 'free', 'kill', 'Jews.Who', 'was', 'bastard', 'was', 'laughing']",One Day in September 1999

No matter how many times I've seen this film the images still haunt me long after the film is over.Using archival footage, photos, & new interviews with key people involved, as well as, family members, ""One Day In September"" chronicles September 5, 1972 & the massacre of the Israli Olympic Team in Munich, West Germany home of the XXth Olympiad.From the early dawning hours of the break in at the Olympic Village, to the tragic final hours at the airport, ""One Day In September"" shows the viewer a raw, unflinching look at what happened during that dark day.Usually, for me, I'm not particularly a big fan of the documentary until I saw this film (when I used to hear the word ""documentary"" I would think of the old high school science or nature film that I would have to watch in class & my eyes would start to glaze over with boredom).I first watched ""September"", spookily enough, 28 years & 3 days after the incident & less than one year before another September day. A darker day in American history that would be forever known as 9/11.Like I said twice before the film is unflinching, but also a bit brutal & overall honest (the film states the facts & doesn't preach.I find that a rarity).Scenes that still stick in my mind:The daughter of one of the slain athletes tells of how she sees her father thru the eyes of people who knew him, but, she can never hug him or tell him that she loves him (she can barely speak the last words without her voice breaking & her eyes tearing up).

Rahmeier,"[10, 25]","Having read the previously submitted reviews, I think that ONE DAY IN SEPTEMBER's one significant flaw is its cursory portrayal of Palestinian grievances.  The highly-trained Black September commandos had definite motivations behind the decisions they made.  Jamal Al-Gashey is given a very brief moment at the beginning to describe the experiences of his youth in a refugee camp, after his family had been forcibly expelled from land the Israelis wanted to annex.  When analyzing the acts of the Palestinians, it is important to remember what led them to conduct terrioristic acts.  In 1967, the combined forces of the Syrians, Jordanians, Egyptians, &amp; Palestinians were defeated in battle by the Israelis (the Six Day War) and the West Bank and Gaza Strip occupied.  After this war, unarmed Palstinian protestors were routinely shot down by Israeli security forces.  Not having the advanced weaponry of Israel and seeing peaceful protest mowed down in a hail of gunfire, the Palestinians turned to terrorism as their only viable option.  They struck at the 1972 Munich Olympics because of the high publicity.  Their Israeli victims were not merely athletes, but also reserve soldiers, per Israel's requirement that every Israeli serve in the military (Orthodox Israelis excepted). What happened at Munich was horrible, and it shouldn't have occurred.  It is vital, however, to understand the motivations of both sides and know why they made the decisions they did.",4,Slightly Unbalanced,991267200,"05 31, 2001",2001,1470,"['Having', 'read', 'previously', 'submitted', 'reviews', 'think', 'ONE', 'DAY', 'IN', 'SEPTEMBER', 'one', 'significant', 'flaw', 'cursory', 'portrayal', 'Palestinian', 'grievances', 'highly-trained', 'Black', 'September', 'commandos', 'had', 'definite', 'motivations', 'decisions', 'made', 'Jamal', 'Al-Gashey', 'given', 'very', 'brief', 'moment', 'beginning', 'describe', 'experiences', 'youth', 'refugee', 'camp', 'family', 'had', 'been', 'forcibly', 'expelled', 'land', 'Israelis', 'wanted', 'annex', 'When', 'analyzing', 'acts', 'Palestinians', 'important', 'remember', 'what', 'led', 'conduct', 'terrioristic', 'acts', '1967', 'combined', 'forces', 'Syrians', 'Jordanians', 'Egyptians', 'amp', 'Palestinians', 'were', 'defeated', 'battle', 'Israelis', 'Six', 'Day', 'War', 'West', 'Bank', 'Gaza', 'Strip', 'occupied', 'war', 'unarmed', 'Palstinian', 'protestors', 'were', 'routinely', 'shot', 'down', 'Israeli', 'security', 'forces', 'Not', 'having', 'advanced', 'weaponry', 'Israel', 'seeing', 'peaceful', 'protest', 'mowed', 'down', 'hail', 'gunfire', 'Palestinians', 'turned', 'terrorism', 'only', 'viable', 'option', 'struck', '1972', 'Munich', 'Olympics', 'high', 'publicity', 'Israeli', 'victims', 'were', 'not', 'merely', 'also', 'reserve', 'soldiers', 'Israel', 'requirement', 'Israeli', 'serve', 'military', 'Orthodox', 'Israelis', 'excepted', 'What', 'happened', 'Munich', 'was', 'horrible', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'occurred', 'vital', 'however', 'understand', 'motivations', 'sides', 'know', 'why', 'made', 'decisions', 'did']",One Day in September 1999
572426,A352W7VHU57GYP,B000059H77,"""vinces""","[3, 19]","Many of the more positive reviews seem to have been written by Israelis.  Unfortunately many of the qualities they found in this film will be completely missing in other people's experience.The average viewer who watches this film to either understand the incident or to gain some insight into the Isreali/Palastinian conflict will be disappointed. So will those seeking the vicarious thrill of watching a real life action-drama unfold.Much of the film attempted to appeal to the emotions of the audience dwelling on the personal tragedy of one hostage's family and to a lesser extent that of another. That did little to give purpose or coherence to the film. There was considerable padding with footage of the Olympics, in case you have no idea what goes on there, footage of policemen, people lounging, and what felt like 20 minutes of terrorists staring out of windows and doorways. It could easily be pared down to an hour and serve as midweek PBS fodder. The early 70's rock music in the soundtrack, chosen perhaps to lend period mood, was cheesey and extremely annoying.One positive comment I have is the movie explained some of the mystery behind the very bad performance of the German authorities. The greatest problem was lack of control (TV crews had free access allowing the live broadcast of an attempted police ambush which the terrorists were able to watch on TV) and lack of communication, both attributable to lack of training and appropriate organizational structure. The Germans at that time had no counterterrorist police units and their laws prevented military intervention. The police snipers had no radios, body armor or even proper sniper rifles.  One policeman was accidentally killed and another officer accidentally wounded.",2,A Boring Disappointment,993254400,"06 23, 2001",2001,1750,"['Many', 'more', 'positive', 'reviews', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'Israelis', 'Unfortunately', 'many', 'qualities', 'found', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'completely', 'missing', 'other', 'people', 'experience.The', 'average', 'viewer', 'who', 'film', 'understand', 'incident', 'gain', 'insight', 'Isreali/Palastinian', 'conflict', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'So', 'will', 'seeking', 'vicarious', 'thrill', 'watching', 'real', 'life', 'action-drama', 'unfold.Much', 'film', 'attempted', 'appeal', 'emotions', 'audience', 'dwelling', 'personal', 'tragedy', 'one', 'hostage', 'family', 'lesser', 'extent', 'did', 'little', 'give', 'purpose', 'coherence', 'film', 'was', 'considerable', 'padding', 'footage', 'Olympics', 'case', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'footage', 'policemen', 'people', 'lounging', 'what', 'felt', '20', 'minutes', 'terrorists', 'staring', 'windows', 'doorways', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'pared', 'down', 'hour', 'serve', 'midweek', 'PBS', 'fodder', 'early', '70', 'rock', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'chosen', 'perhaps', 'lend', 'period', 'mood', 'was', 'cheesey', 'extremely', 'annoying.One', 'positive', 'comment', 'have', 'movie', 'explained', 'mystery', 'very', 'bad', 'performance', 'German', 'authorities', 'greatest', 'problem', 'was', 'lack', 'control', 'TV', 'crews', 'had', 'free', 'access', 'allowing', 'live', 'broadcast', 'attempted', 'police', 'ambush', 'terrorists', 'were', 'able', 'watch', 'TV', 'lack', 'communication', 'attributable', 'lack', 'training', 'appropriate', 'organizational', 'structure', 'Germans', 'time', 'had', 'counterterrorist', 'police', 'units', 'laws', 'prevented', 'military', 'intervention', 'police', 'snipers', 'had', 'radios', 'body', 'armor', 'even', 'proper', 'sniper', 'rifles', 'One', 'policeman', 'was', 'accidentally', 'killed', 'officer', 'accidentally', 'wounded']",One Day in September 1999

Although only 1 year old at the time,I knew about it in later years through stories and short segments on tv and magazines. BOY....DID I LEARN MUCH MORE ABOUT IT AFTER BUYING THIS DVD!!!!! I didn't realize, even by its title, that this tragedy began and ended on the same day. It's like the typical 2-hour movie where you realize after it ends that it spanned only one entire day. It is such a shame that these wonderful role models and heroes to the people of Israel had to give their lives because of some stupid wannabee-Bin Ladens who decided to mix sports with politics. Watching it brought such disgust...from the little concerns of other athletes who were relaxing outdoors in the same premises to the local authorities who anyone certainly knows did not get trained to handle terror-related situations to the olympic committee who chose to continue the games regardless of what happened,it is a documentary that both saddens and angers you. It is like an action movie where you hope the superhero will come to the rescue and bring the story its happy ending. The only difference is....there is no action hero and there is no happy ending. It is one of those movies that deep down inside makes you realize how sickening racism is and how we forget not to judge a book by its cover. Unbelievably it was not until 24 years later,at the 1996 games in Atlanta,that the olympic committee finally decided to pay tribute to these brave men who gave their lives for all.
