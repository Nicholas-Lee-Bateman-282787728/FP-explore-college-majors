Amazon did not even have this movie yet so I had to purchase it from Amazon.com.uk! So the ""voting buttons"" are missing. How snitty amazon can be! Period dramas are my favorite type of movie. James Purefoy (Rome,Vanity Fair, Mayor of Casterbridge, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, Mansfield Park)is one of my favorite actors, so this movie was destined to be a favorite! Historically it is of great value. Just think, if it weren't for Beau Brummel, our men might still wear ruffles. The most excellent supporting cast includes Hugh Bonneville(also of Mansfield Park)and Matthew Rhys. My only complaint is that this movie is too short. I am sure this story deserves more than it's length of only 79 minutes and someone should be ""horse whipped"" or at least ashamed of the stunted state of this production.  Now, if we might only be able to purchase ""Blackbeard"" starring James Purefoy, on DVD as well! One may only hope!

1158333,A3JVLSWJ9629TD,B00180IPQM,D. Madsen,"[12, 12]","(Spoilers ahead)  I was just so overjoyed that someone spent some time to make a film based on ""the Beau"" that was not some cinematic concoction!The film gives the major elements of Beau Brummell's life:  his vanity and cockiness, his influence on the Prince Regent (played by Hugh Bonneville, now known for his role in ""Downton Abbey"" as the amiable Earl of Grantham) and on men's fashion, credited with getting men out of knee breeches in into trousers.  We see him preen and see the pursuit of the bailiffs who come to take payment of his extravagances.  We see how his familiarity with the Prince Regent has a limit, and his wit finally oversteps its boundaries, leading to his social demise.  The film infers that Brummell was also a lover of Lord Byron as well as courtesan Julia Johnstone, in a brief menage a trois.What we don't see is the sad end of this man, his dying in a charity house of tertiary syphilis.  There was not too much displaying his well-known caustic wit that would no doubt render the film character unlikeable.  There is not even a hint at the real end of the man.  The audience is robbed of a conclusion.  Maybe the director's vision was a feel-good movie, as upbeat as the catchy film soundtrack.  Those not familiar with Brummell's life presume he skipped off to Paris to escape his debts and lived in obscurity.  The truth is much less candy-coated.James Purefoy makes an admirable Beau, far too confident for his own good. The costuming is well-done and the scene of the Beau's toilette for the Prince and his cronies is hilarious.I highly suggest reading the engaging and thorough biography written by actor Ian Kelly, ""Beau Brummell:  The Ultimate Man of Style,"" on which the film is loosely based.  It is well researched and makes no sweeping, unfounded assumptions about the life of Beau Brummell.  It is interesting to note that Mr. Kelly had a minor role in this film as one of the Beau's ""body dandiacal.""",4,Good but could have been so much more,1305244800,"05 13, 2011",2011,1946,"['Spoilers', 'ahead', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'overjoyed', 'someone', 'spent', 'time', 'make', 'film', 'based', 'Beau', 'was', 'not', 'cinematic', 'concoction', 'film', 'major', 'elements', 'Beau', 'Brummell', 'life', 'vanity', 'cockiness', 'influence', 'Prince', 'Regent', 'played', 'Hugh', 'Bonneville', 'now', 'known', 'role', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'amiable', 'Earl', 'Grantham', 'men', 'fashion', 'credited', 'getting', 'men', 'knee', 'breeches', 'trousers', 'see', 'preen', 'see', 'pursuit', 'bailiffs', 'who', 'come', 'take', 'payment', 'extravagances', 'see', 'how', 'familiarity', 'Prince', 'Regent', 'limit', 'wit', 'finally', 'boundaries', 'leading', 'social', 'demise', 'film', 'infers', 'Brummell', 'was', 'also', 'lover', 'Lord', 'Byron', 'as', 'well', 'courtesan', 'Julia', 'Johnstone', 'brief', 'menage', 'trois.What', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'sad', 'end', 'man', 'dying', 'charity', 'house', 'tertiary', 'syphilis', 'was', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'displaying', 'well-known', 'caustic', 'wit', 'would', 'doubt', 'render', 'film', 'character', 'unlikeable', 'not', 'even', 'hint', 'real', 'end', 'man', 'audience', 'robbed', 'conclusion', 'Maybe', 'director', 'vision', 'was', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'as', 'upbeat', 'catchy', 'film', 'soundtrack', 'not', 'familiar', 'Brummell', 'life', 'presume', 'skipped', 'off', 'Paris', 'escape', 'debts', 'lived', 'obscurity', 'truth', 'much', 'less', 'candy-coated.James', 'Purefoy', 'admirable', 'Beau', 'far', 'too', 'confident', 'own', 'good', 'costuming', 'well-done', 'scene', 'Beau', 'toilette', 'Prince', 'cronies', 'hilarious.I', 'highly', 'suggest', 'reading', 'engaging', 'thorough', 'biography', 'written', 'actor', 'Ian', 'Kelly', 'Beau', 'Brummell', 'Ultimate', 'Man', 'Style', 'film', 'loosely', 'based', 'well', 'researched', 'sweeping', 'unfounded', 'assumptions', 'life', 'Beau', 'Brummell', 'interesting', 'note', 'Mr.', 'Kelly', 'had', 'minor', 'role', 'film', 'one', 'Beau', 'body', 'dandiacal']",Beau Brummell - This Charming Man
1158334,A37IHRVO8JWYF2,B00180IPQM,Emily D. Agunod,"[3, 4]","Quite entertaining story of how dandyism came to be.  Beau Brummel changed men's fashion from the foppish style of wearing wigs, makeup, and overdecorated clothes to the more sedate, manly style that we love in Regency movies.  The story is not that deep but it does have some moral lessons like the price of extravagance and valuing loyalty and friendship.  James Purefoy is  perfect for the role Beau Brummel. What became of Beau Brummel was quite common during his time when men were addicted to gambling and excessive spending.

1158336,A3160YSU1KRL8E,B00180IPQM,Justin Playfair,"[3, 3]","""Beau Brummell: This Charming Man"" is a brief, romantic look into the life of the man who finally changed the ridiculous attire that had been a tradition for many years of wearing a powdered wig, make up and stockings to a new form of appearance, later known as the ""Dandy"". This consisted of a ruffled shirt, overcoat, trousers, high boots and top hat and cane in the traditional ""Dickensian"" manner to which we as audiences are accustomed to gaze upon.There is something about this film and I believe that it is the lively musical score, which fits the film perfectly and encourages a certain ""pace"" about it.His influence over George IV to accept the ""Dandy"" look as the new ""manly"" form of gentlemen's dress essentially turned the tide of fashion history. Although Brummell himself is an extremely flawed and immoral character, we tend to accept his faults.What is unbelievable but true is that people used to pay to watch him dress in the morning, which could take several hours, in order to understand the nature of the fashion revolution that was upon them.Recommended as a very different departure from the usual. There is a funny ""confrontation"" scene where two ""FOPS"" meet Brummell and his Servant dressed as ""Dandys"". They mutually insult each otherand break out into ""fisticuffs"" but the ""Dandy"" wins easily due to the greater mobility in their new threads!

1158337,A1GHO6BR5J0NHX,B00180IPQM,Richard Masloski,"[4, 6]","I hate when historical dramatizations treat facts in so frivolously fictitious a fashion that one ends up wondering why the thing was ever made.  Why invent when any given reality is ever so more precious?I don't know all that much about Brummell (and learned very little about him in this flick), but I do about Byron.  To perfidiously suggest that Lord Byron played a large part in bringing Brummell down is what is truly scandalous in this silly telling.  Scrope Davis, Byron's life-long friend, was a crony of Brummell's - but Byron's interplay with Brummell is marginal, if even that.  Yet even beyond the slanderous suggestions of Byron's dissolute and desultory effects on this biopic's supposedly charming hero, there is the matter of Matthew Rhys attempting to step into Byron's boots, one of which was fashioned for a lame leg.  Simply put, if the historical Lord Byron was anything at all like the one portrayed in this film, no women would have swooned and fainted when he entered a room (and if they had, it would have been out of fright!), nor would they have scrambled across continents to ""unphilosophize"" him.  Unlike the actual Byron who was, according to one of his innumerable lovers, famously judged ""mad, bad and dangerous to know"" - Rhys is, well, just ""bad."" And NOT in a ""good"" way!  It hardly helps matters that he looks more like a cross twixt the young Steven Spielberg and the young Barbra Streisand than one of the most beautiful faces of the day.But apart from Byron, if one knew hardly anything whatsoever about Beau Brummel, about a quarter way in one might be wondering why in the world they were watching this film. It is minimal to an excessive degree.  And apart from the Spartan script, there is a truly threadbare feel to this entire undertaking.  The whole story is alloted a few cramped sets - and no sense of the true style of the era is conveyed.  I also understand that the modernistic music score is supposed to hint at Brummell's futuristic sense of style and all (""the dashing designer of modern dress - and disgrace"") it says on the DVD cover - yet the music isn't great - it merely grates.  And even though people came from far and wide to watch our fashion-plate hero dress, I highly doubt if he permitted them to watch him attire himself from a ballsy state of complete nudity.In short, I wasted money on this one,  money I could have placed on a number at the nearest gaming table.",1,REGENCY RIDICULOUSNESS,1356393600,"12 25, 2012",2012,2433,"['hate', 'when', 'historical', 'dramatizations', 'treat', 'facts', 'so', 'frivolously', 'fictitious', 'fashion', 'one', 'up', 'wondering', 'why', 'thing', 'was', 'ever', 'made', 'Why', 'invent', 'when', 'given', 'reality', 'ever', 'so', 'more', 'precious', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'Brummell', 'learned', 'very', 'little', 'flick', 'do', 'Byron', 'perfidiously', 'suggest', 'Lord', 'Byron', 'played', 'large', 'part', 'bringing', 'Brummell', 'down', 'what', 'truly', 'scandalous', 'silly', 'telling', 'Scrope', 'Davis', 'Byron', 'life-long', 'friend', 'was', 'crony', 'Brummell', 'Byron', 'interplay', 'Brummell', 'marginal', 'even', 'even', 'slanderous', 'suggestions', 'Byron', 'dissolute', 'desultory', 'effects', 'biopic', 'supposedly', 'charming', 'hero', 'matter', 'Matthew', 'Rhys', 'attempting', 'step', 'Byron', 'boots', 'one', 'was', 'fashioned', 'lame', 'leg', 'Simply', 'put', 'historical', 'Lord', 'Byron', 'was', 'anything', 'one', 'portrayed', 'film', 'women', 'would', 'have', 'swooned', 'fainted', 'when', 'entered', 'room', 'had', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fright', 'would', 'have', 'scrambled', 'continents', 'unphilosophize', 'actual', 'Byron', 'who', 'was', 'according', 'one', 'innumerable', 'lovers', 'famously', 'judged', 'mad', 'bad', 'dangerous', 'know', 'Rhys', 'well', 'just', 'bad', 'NOT', 'good', 'way', 'hardly', 'matters', 'more', 'cross', 'young', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'young', 'Barbra', 'Streisand', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'day.But', 'apart', 'Byron', 'one', 'knew', 'hardly', 'anything', 'whatsoever', 'Beau', 'Brummel', 'quarter', 'way', 'one', 'might', 'be', 'wondering', 'why', 'world', 'were', 'watching', 'film', 'minimal', 'excessive', 'degree', 'apart', 'Spartan', 'script', 'truly', 'threadbare', 'feel', 'entire', 'undertaking', 'whole', 'story', 'alloted', 'few', 'cramped', 'sets', 'sense', 'true', 'style', 'era', 'conveyed', 'also', 'understand', 'modernistic', 'music', 'score', 'supposed', 'hint', 'Brummell', 'futuristic', 'sense', 'style', 'dashing', 'designer', 'modern', 'dress', 'disgrace', 'DVD', 'cover', 'yet', 'music', ""n't"", 'great', 'merely', 'even', 'people', 'came', 'far', 'wide', 'watch', 'fashion-plate', 'hero', 'dress', 'highly', 'doubt', 'permitted', 'watch', 'attire', 'ballsy', 'state', 'complete', 'nudity.In', 'short', 'wasted', 'money', 'one', 'money', 'could', 'have', 'placed', 'number', 'nearest', 'gaming', 'table']",Beau Brummell - This Charming Man
