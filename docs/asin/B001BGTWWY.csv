1172091,A84UG66LK8JD9,B001BGTWWY,Amazon Customer,"[5, 8]","It's hard to come out with consistently good albums. Few bands can come out with more than 2 or 3 without releasing a few band ones along the way. This is especially true with live albums, and the amount of live material Dream Theater has released both officially and unofficially doesn't help this CD at all.Most people reading this review already know what to expect: the instruments are pretty much dead on, the vocals are way above average and hit stellar, but not without a few nails on the chalkboard moments (hey, no overdubs, so what do you expect?).I think casual fans will love this DVD, especially those who are just getting into Dream Theater. While it's not as flashy as other DVDs around, it definitely covers a wider range of material than most of score and showcases the various talents of the band's members.But hardcore fans aren't going to like it so much. While the setlist is different and there are certainly gems included, we've seen the official DVDs of the last two albums, which are some of the best any band has ever put out. We've seen the official bootlegs, too. So it's pretty safe to say that this, on the whole, is nothing new for us. Being able to listen to songs like ""scarred"" and ""surrounded 07"" as well as satisfying the normal curiosity of hearing songs live for the first time is about all this album will do for the diehards.Dream Theater set the bar too high too often, so it shouldn't be a surprise when sometimes DVD budgets or concert budgets aren't as high as last time around. I give this 4 stars because, though it deserves less by DT standards, giving it anything lower is a sin when you match it up to the bland, overdubbed albums other bands put out maybe once or twice in their careers.Give it some time, and be thankful that Dream Theater use their budget for this kind of thing. Soon, if you're like me, you'll be glad to add this to the cycle of Dream Theater DVDs available for watching or showing friends.  Like with most things Dream Theater do now, reactions may be harsh at first but this too will eventually be considered a classic.",4,Hardcore Fans Most Likely Disappointed,1222732800,"09 30, 2008",2008,2092,"['hard', 'come', 'out', 'consistently', 'good', 'albums', 'Few', 'bands', 'can', 'come', 'out', 'more', '2', '3', 'releasing', 'few', 'band', 'ones', 'way', 'especially', 'true', 'live', 'albums', 'amount', 'live', 'material', 'Dream', 'Theater', 'released', 'officially', 'unofficially', ""n't"", 'help', 'CD', 'all.Most', 'people', 'reading', 'review', 'already', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'instruments', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'dead', 'vocals', 'are', 'way', 'average', 'hit', 'stellar', 'not', 'few', 'nails', 'chalkboard', 'moments', 'hey', 'overdubs', 'what', 'do', 'expect', '.I', 'think', 'casual', 'fans', 'will', 'love', 'DVD', 'especially', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'getting', 'Dream', 'Theater', 'not', 'as', 'flashy', 'other', 'DVDs', 'definitely', 'wider', 'range', 'material', 'most', 'score', 'various', 'talents', 'band', 'members.But', 'hardcore', 'fans', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'like', 'so', 'much', 'setlist', 'different', 'are', 'certainly', 'gems', 'included', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'official', 'DVDs', 'last', 'two', 'albums', 'are', 'best', 'band', 'ever', 'put', 'out', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'official', 'bootlegs', 'too', 'pretty', 'safe', 'say', 'whole', 'nothing', 'new', 'Being', 'able', 'listen', 'songs', 'scarred', 'surrounded', '07', 'as', 'well', 'satisfying', 'normal', 'curiosity', 'hearing', 'songs', 'live', 'first', 'time', 'album', 'will', 'do', 'diehards.Dream', 'Theater', 'set', 'bar', 'too', 'high', 'too', 'often', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprise', 'when', 'sometimes', 'DVD', 'budgets', 'concert', 'budgets', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'high', 'last', 'time', 'give', '4', 'stars', 'because', 'less', 'DT', 'standards', 'giving', 'anything', 'lower', 'sin', 'when', 'match', 'bland', 'overdubbed', 'other', 'bands', 'put', 'out', 'maybe', 'once', 'twice', 'careers.Give', 'time', 'be', 'thankful', 'Dream', 'Theater', 'use', 'budget', 'kind', 'thing', 'Soon', ""'re"", ""'ll"", 'be', 'glad', 'add', 'cycle', 'Dream', 'Theater', 'DVDs', 'available', 'watching', 'showing', 'friends', 'most', 'things', 'Dream', 'Theater', 'do', 'now', 'reactions', 'may', 'be', 'harsh', 'first', 'too', 'will', 'eventually', 'be', 'considered', 'classic']",N/A

I really don't have a problem with the format per se, just the execution of it and the cost of the DVD.  Video quality is, at best, a very good SD videocam.  But with consumer HD videocams at under $600, couldn't we use those?  Heck, even the interviews video quality is sub par.  And the 5.1 sound is not the best, sometimes has weird sounds coming from the rear speakers and has little or no subwoofer action going.  Could be better.  If the price were say $10 less I would give it four stars because of the value, but at $24......  And before I get slammed like anyone here who dares to say something bad, 3 stars is still ""good"" and I'm still enjoying the DVD.

1172093,A1FELYY4UPE78M,B001BGTWWY,Chris R. Call,"[9, 13]","I'm a collector of DT. This tour saw DT at the best of their Careers so far. So here's what I think of the picks on this collection as compared to other versions on the tour.Constant MotionGreat take. Totally cool choice. Play it loud. I liked Calgary better.Panic AttackThis was taken from my least favorite show on the tour that I've heard.I don't really like it here any more than I did in Buenos Ares. Blah. It's okay, but DT played so many better takes of this song I don't know why they chose this one. It might have something to do with a line following on the DVD by a band member 'It becomes kind of routine. You reflect and you say, you know we're the same guys that we started this when we were really young goin to college for the first time. ... You kinda look at each other and go I can't believe we're still doin this.' I find it curious that things were so crazy and chaotic among the band the day of the Toronto show, which was one of the best on the Tour.Blind FaithJames might piss you off here. And it's true he can sing this better, but he's also singing it with character. He's strongly weak. He needs to sing this song softer to bring it out beautifully. lol. The band is on. I heard this in Toronto and will say I thought it was the weak song of the set. Scarred was incredible that night. Either way, the song is strong and it's worth having. The band is rockin it. I'll keep coming back to it on my stereo. Plus, we need this song on an official Live release.SurroundedThis song was beautiful so many times on the tour. I've heard a better take than this one from the tour. Calgary and Japan come to mind but I don't feel let down by this. James is awake. I love it. You'll probably love it. This is a good example of how awesome the band was on this tour.The Toronto show was incredible.The Dark Eternal NightAnother song that from this tour, has shaken my walls, house and car. I just don't like this take. As a writer I know that hundredths of seconds can mean the difference between alight and serious head banging awesomeness. That's the case here. It just seems off by a very slight margin as compared to some other versions I love so much. When I heard the solo I got it. They're playing the song a little faster than normal, and that bit of speed is rushing them into a beat that's just not as strong as usual. Unfortunate.Jordan Rudess Keyboard SoloIf you dig the solo from this tour, you'll dig this.This rocks.Lines in the SandDT plays this album so well. I'm also a fan of Derek Sherinian. This song was no letdown on the tour. This is not a bad take. I sort of enjoyed it. The trouble is, again, there are better takes out there. More fluid takes. The band doesn't sound cohesive here. The timing is a little off. The energy is not on par with the awesomeness of this tour. James belts out a couple of cool notes. If you know him badly, you'll be impressed. If you know him strong, you'll know he's been better all across this tour.ScarredOne of my favorite songs by DT. My favorite take was Italy 2002. I believe this one may take that throne. Oh dear sweet lord of all. Buy the set for this song. :) I was hoping, expecting the whole thing to be as incredible as this based on the strength of their tour. Regardless, this live album tells a story. This is an important part of that story.Enter Progressive Nation.If you've heard any of it... you know.The repentance clip is very... very... interesting.DT is holding the song for their next tour. >,>ForsakenI love this song. I was always a little disappointed with James' singing of it over the tour. James is asking why on some songs. Maybe we'll find out why. It's just a bad display of vocals. Add the short fall offs from some of the notes. The truth is, I don't know a better take. So rock it if you're not embarrassed to blast the song when James adds W's to his words. I won't play this take again.The Ministry of Lost SoulsYes please. The album version was lacking, but live this is a masterpiece on the level of Metropolis. As beautiful as this take is, it's lacking compared to what I've heard from the tour. Don't misread, the song is beautiful here. You can play this loud. I'll go to another take though.Okay, a really hillarious thing about a comment saying Detroit can get stale on the 25th time. I was at that show. I think it's the best show DT has ever played. A fun fact. No known recording exists. James also changed the lyrics to voices. The word Voices was replaced by Life.Take the TimeJanuary 15th show? Truth be told, the song was incredible that night, but the audience, eliminated from these recordings played a big part that night. Why think it's time for a change>? Why makes sense here. The way James follows. Cool take. Is James really trying though>? I know for a fact he's been better. Better in 95.. for this track. I just sung along... nope, he's not putting out. Rock it though, if you want '95 or earlier take the time, I don't think you'll quite find it. At least, I haven't. Good thing we can find a better from '96 on for any other DT track. My point? James can sing. And if you think the end of '94 was his end (there are some of you out there). DT might not be the right band for you. Example, I got a cough, hacking, snotting, and my voice got stronger. James too, has had a similar experience. Christmas '94 I believe. Weird world.In the presence of EnemiesThere are heavy breaths and a W phrase here. The band also doesn't seem to be rocking quite as well as I know them to on this song. Still, I'm being critical. Take this over the album version for sure. The song turns around. The beginning of pt 2 is incredibly beautiful. I haven't heard it this wonderful on the tour. This is my thesis. Is DT only as good as we believe they are on our stereo? Suddenly the song is incredible. Set your speakers on fire with volume. 5 bucks says I listen to all this again believing they're the best takes and they are. Is this your memory Langden? This is my dream. This sonic beauty I'm hearing right now.Shmedly WilcoxChill. I've never heard Wilcox sound this beautiful.There's enough here to be worth having. I'm not throwing it away. There's a story to be told. There's emotion. Heart.

1172095,A2LTL305X8YRBY,B001BGTWWY,Michael,"[0, 0]","A few years ago, I had always heard of Dream Theater from a buddy who was a big fan, he constantly talked about them. At first, I thought ""great music, but the vocals ruin it for me."" After a while, I got more used to the vocals. Even if you're not used to them, the music is spectacular on every album. I had started off on a couple of albums, Train Of Thought and Systematic Chaos, plus Live At Budokan on dvd because my buddy told me how much he always listened to it. Let me start off by saying be prepared when you intend to watch a dvd like that. A typical DT album averages around 77 minutes. We're talking long songs, well written ones at that. The live stuff on Live At Budokan, and this run in at around 3 hours long. Almost like watching Lord Of The Rings. Good thing there's a ""pause"" option. If you can keep your attention on the band for that long, it's truly a spectacle to watch as it is to listen to one of their records. I like to try and plan when to watch one of the dvd's if I can when I'm in the mood so that it's easier to view the whole show, and maybe some extras.Anyway, on to the review. Chaos In Motion is a kind of all-access pass for the DT fan that follows the band on their 2007-2008 world tour with everything from live footage from different shows to backstage footage, interviews, behind the scenes extras, music videos, and even projection videos that they used for a few of their songs. If you've read other reviews, let me tell you that the video quality of the live footage is not as bad as others say it is, but don't expect Live At Budokan. After I read the back cover of the dvd, I knew what I was getting when it mentioned ""raw footage."" The overall look works well though. Nothing too flashy, their stage show is already flashy as it is. I like that they didn't doctor it up or whatever. Budokan was great, but I think that the band knew it'd be difficult to top. So, why try? People have their own opinions, and if they're so disappointed just because of the video quality, well....then it's their loss. The live audio is great as it was mixed by Kevin Shirley, whose worked with DT on several albums including the Live At Budokan cd and dvd.Overall, everything is how it should be. If you're expecting another Score or Live At Budokan, then yes, you're likely gonna be disappointed. Otherwise, buy it. Also, if you're new to the band, it's hard to recommend which albums to get because they're all different and all very good. However, if you're a metal head like me, start off with Train Of Thought (was written with the live show in mind, and features some of the heaviest music ever written by the band), Systematic Chaos (catchy as hell, and is perfect for starters), Scenes From A Memory (if you like concept albums.

1172096,AF65C8QK9NNXP,B001BGTWWY,Michael,"[1, 1]",This is a strange one. Dream Theater have got a great set list on this DVD and captured some awesome performances but yes it's true that the sound and vision are average at best. The main thing going for this DVD is the great selection of bonus footage including lots of behind the scenes looks at the whole Dream Theater organisation and cool interviews with band members. If you think that you want to see the inner workings of a Dream Theater tour and who the key players are then you will enjoy this DVD. I can recommend this to fans of the band but if you're new to Dream Theater follow everyone's advice and get one of their other concert DVD's which are of an infinitely higher production quality.,3,"Good music, average production, awesome extras!",1264118400,"01 22, 2010",2010,704,"['strange', 'one', 'Dream', 'Theater', 'have', 'got', 'great', 'set', 'list', 'DVD', 'captured', 'awesome', 'performances', 'true', 'sound', 'vision', 'are', 'average', 'best', 'main', 'thing', 'going', 'DVD', 'great', 'selection', 'bonus', 'footage', 'including', 'lots', 'scenes', 'whole', 'Dream', 'Theater', 'organisation', 'cool', 'interviews', 'band', 'members', 'think', 'want', 'see', 'inner', 'workings', 'Dream', 'Theater', 'tour', 'who', 'key', 'players', 'are', 'then', 'will', 'enjoy', 'DVD', 'can', 'recommend', 'fans', 'band', ""'re"", 'new', 'Dream', 'Theater', 'follow', 'everyone', 'advice', 'get', 'one', 'other', 'concert', 'DVD', 'are', 'infinitely', 'higher', 'production', 'quality']",N/A

Here is what I think about it.I have every Dream Theater DVD to date, but this one lacks the quality of Live at Budokan or Score. I didn't know that this was going to be raw footage until I read the back of the case. The video quality looks decent, but if your expecting the look or nice camera angles of the past concert DVDs, you might be disappointed.There are plenty of extra features on disk two that run well over two hours. There is a 90 minute documentary about the band's 35 country tour, some music videos and Mike Portnoy takes us on and behind stage in two short, but enjoyable segments. I really loved the documentary. You get to know the band, the crew and what life on the road is like.The main thing Dream Theater does well with these DVDs (and they put one out about every two years) is the fact that they all feature different songs. The songs on here won't be found on the previous releases, which is nice for the fans.The concert footage is good, could be better, but with a whole disc of extras, this is a must for anyone who likes Dream Theater.Disc oneIntro/Also sprach ZarathustraConstant MotionPanic AttackBlind FaithSurroundedThe Dark Eternal NightKeyboard SoloLines in the SandScarredForsakenThe Ministry of Lost SoulsTake the TimeIn the Presence of EnemiesMedley:I.

I shouldn't have relied so much on the negative ones, as this turned out to be pretty decent. The only negative to this, in my opinion, would be the audio. I watch all my concerts on a portable dvd player with a good set of headphones. Therefore I can just crank higher if I need to. When I put it on the computer, the sound was really low. I put it on through the television and the same problem. This would be the only negative thing with this dvd I can find. The video is well shot. The footage is taken from a few different venues. This makes the concert footage really feel like a  ""documentary"" of the tour. With all the interviews and (much appreciated) information as to what goes into a DT performance, this turned out to be an incredible documentary of the even more incredible SYSTEMATIC CHAOS TOUR.The members,as always, are in top form. There seemed to be special attention provided to the playing of John Petrucci. WHO COULD ASK FOR MORE? The man is the most underated guitar player in all circles. (Every member of the band is underated as well.) This video documents through the Documentary on disc2 and the live footage on disc1, just what all the hype is about this band that has been pleasing many a fan for over 20 years.All in all, if you are a fan, or just a casual observer of the band, you will not be dissapointed with this documentary of an unbelievable tour!",5,Well done presentation!,1244764800,"06 12, 2009",2009,1452,"['put', 'off', 'getting', 'double', 'dvd', 'when', 'reviews', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'relied', 'so', 'much', 'negative', 'ones', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'pretty', 'decent', 'only', 'negative', 'opinion', 'would', 'be', 'audio', 'watch', 'concerts', 'portable', 'dvd', 'player', 'good', 'set', 'headphones', 'can', 'just', 'crank', 'higher', 'need', 'When', 'put', 'computer', 'sound', 'was', 'really', 'low', 'put', 'television', 'same', 'problem', 'would', 'be', 'only', 'negative', 'thing', 'dvd', 'can', 'find', 'video', 'well', 'shot', 'footage', 'taken', 'few', 'different', 'venues', 'concert', 'footage', 'really', 'feel', 'documentary', 'tour', 'interviews', 'much', 'appreciated', 'information', 'what', 'DT', 'performance', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'incredible', 'documentary', 'even', 'more', 'incredible', 'SYSTEMATIC', 'CHAOS', 'TOUR.The', 'members', 'always', 'are', 'top', 'form', 'seemed', 'be', 'special', 'attention', 'provided', 'playing', 'John', 'Petrucci', 'WHO', 'COULD', 'ASK', 'FOR', 'MORE', 'man', 'most', 'underated', 'guitar', 'player', 'circles', 'Every', 'member', 'band', 'underated', 'as', 'well', 'video', 'documents', 'Documentary', 'disc2', 'live', 'footage', 'disc1', 'just', 'what', 'hype', 'band', 'been', 'pleasing', 'many', 'fan', '20', 'years.All', 'are', 'fan', 'just', 'casual', 'observer', 'band', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'dissapointed', 'documentary', 'unbelievable', 'tour']",N/A

If you do not like Systematic Chaos, do not bother here, as there is nothing that will change the way you think about it. However, even then, this is an interesting package.Disc 1 is an interesting watch- It's a concert video patched together from different areas of the world on their tour, a laFlight 666. It starts off with Constant Motion, which rocks out loud, and there are quite a few good songs to be found on here- Some classics (Take The Time, Surrounded), some newer stuff (Panic Attack, SC stuff), and even an interesting medley to end the show, including ""In the Name of God"" and ""Octavarium"". The video quality is indeed quite shoddy, but hey, not everyone is rich enough to afford Red Digital Cinema, so that was the least of my worries. The performance here is quite good, but the thing that prevents me from saying it's great is James LaBrie. Other reviewers have noted he sounds weak here, and I agree. Blind Faith is a rather sad example- I know he's in his mid-40s, but it's getting to the point where he's starting to come off soft (which leads me to believe his voice was enhanced on their newest album, Black Clouds and Silver Linings). Nonetheless, it was a worthy watch for DT fans.Disc 2... well, like I said, if you don't like SC, then this won't do it for you. Nonetheless it was quite interesting. The 90 minute documentary is a good watch, but as per usual, Portnoy gets in the way with his big ego and his obnoxious tendency to cuss every 2 seconds. There's some promo videos- Constant Motion, two versions of Forsaken, and an ""in-studio"" video of The Dark Eternal Night, which are a good watch, despite the fact that of those songs I only like Constant Motion. Then some projection footage, which is quite fun watching too, regardless of whether or not you like the songs. To top it off, Mike ""Sewermouth"" Portnoy has two videos where his sewer mouth doesn't get in the way- a stage tour and back stage tour, similar to the ""Nicko's Webcam"" videos that once could be found on Iron Maiden's website durng the Brave New World tour.In short, a rather mixed bag of a set, but it was worth the money anyway.",3,"It is what it is, alright...",1264032000,"01 21, 2010",2010,2164,"['Basically', 'know', 'deal', 'do', 'not', 'Systematic', 'Chaos', 'do', 'not', 'bother', 'here', 'nothing', 'will', 'change', 'way', 'think', 'However', 'even', 'then', 'interesting', 'package.Disc', '1', 'interesting', 'watch-', 'concert', 'video', 'patched', 'together', 'different', 'areas', 'world', 'tour', 'laFlight', '666', 'Constant', 'Motion', 'out', 'loud', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'good', 'songs', 'be', 'found', 'here-', 'classics', 'Take', 'Time', 'Surrounded', 'newer', 'stuff', 'Panic', 'Attack', 'SC', 'stuff', 'even', 'interesting', 'medley', 'end', 'show', 'including', 'Name', 'God', 'Octavarium', 'video', 'quality', 'indeed', 'quite', 'shoddy', 'hey', 'not', 'everyone', 'rich', 'enough', 'afford', 'Red', 'Digital', 'Cinema', 'was', 'least', 'worries', 'performance', 'here', 'quite', 'good', 'thing', 'saying', 'great', 'James', 'LaBrie', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'weak', 'here', 'agree', 'Blind', 'Faith', 'rather', 'sad', 'example-', 'know', 'mid-40s', 'getting', 'point', 'where', 'starting', 'come', 'off', 'soft', 'believe', 'voice', 'was', 'enhanced', 'newest', 'album', 'Black', 'Clouds', 'Silver', 'Linings', 'Nonetheless', 'was', 'worthy', 'watch', 'DT', 'fans.Disc', '2', 'well', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'SC', 'then', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'Nonetheless', 'was', 'quite', 'interesting', '90', 'minute', 'documentary', 'good', 'watch', 'usual', 'Portnoy', 'way', 'big', 'ego', 'obnoxious', 'tendency', 'cuss', '2', 'seconds', 'promo', 'videos-', 'Constant', 'Motion', 'two', 'versions', 'Forsaken', 'in-studio', 'video', 'Dark', 'Eternal', 'Night', 'are', 'good', 'watch', 'fact', 'songs', 'only', 'Constant', 'Motion', 'Then', 'projection', 'footage', 'quite', 'fun', 'watching', 'too', 'regardless', 'not', 'songs', 'top', 'off', 'Mike', 'Sewermouth', 'Portnoy', 'two', 'videos', 'where', 'sewer', 'mouth', ""n't"", 'get', 'way-', 'stage', 'tour', 'back', 'stage', 'tour', 'similar', 'Nicko', 'Webcam', 'videos', 'once', 'could', 'be', 'found', 'Iron', 'Maiden', 'website', 'Brave', 'New', 'World', 'tour.In', 'short', 'rather', 'mixed', 'bag', 'set', 'was', 'worth', 'money', 'anyway']",N/A
