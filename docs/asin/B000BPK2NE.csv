If there is anything less than perfect, it is stage presence.  Steve Perry was one of the top 10 male vocalists of the rock era.  On the other hand, when it came to stage presence, he never could produce the charisma, the outrageousness, the excitement, of other lead singers.  As a result, when you see the album, you will say, wow...what a great voice...but not sense anything more than just hearing the same piece on radio.",4,Journey out and get this,1272931200,"05 4, 2010",2010,542,"['devotee', 'Journey', 'Steve', 'Perry', 'just', 'had', 'get', 'not', 'let', 'down', 'hits', 'are', 'there', 'anything', 'less', 'perfect', 'stage', 'presence', 'Steve', 'Perry', 'was', 'one', 'top', '10', 'male', 'vocalists', 'rock', 'era', 'other', 'hand', 'when', 'came', 'stage', 'presence', 'never', 'could', 'produce', 'charisma', 'outrageousness', 'excitement', 'other', 'lead', 'singers', 'result', 'when', 'see', 'album', 'will', 'say', 'wow', 'what', 'great', 'voice', 'not', 'sense', 'anything', 'more', 'just', 'hearing', 'same', 'piece', 'radio']","Journey - Live in Houston 1981, The Escape Tour"

The song selection was perfect and the band sounded great, but......Steve Perry found it necessary to demonstrate that he could run and I mean RUN from one side of the stage to the other while singing and still have enough wind to finish the song.  He could do it; however, while it was a novelty on the first two songs it became a real distraction after doing it for the entire DVD.  I don't see the problem with standing relatively still and singing a song.  Apparently, that was just too much for Perry to handle.  It became such a annoyance that I cannot watch this stupid DVD any more.  The only saving grace is that his running around could become a great drinking game.  Every time he takes off, everybody take a drink.

I recently read an interview with him and and he mentioned that working on the post production of this DVD was very challenging from an emotional standpoint especially since the band has now went on without him.  It was also interesting to note Steve's view of his vocals from that period.  He was surprised of his voice during this concert and how he was able to hit certain notes, nuances without realizing it.Steve has gone on to live his life as he sees it now.  The distance gives even more curiosity and examination into the Journey Band that he was a apart of.

With there being a dvd of the current lineup of Journey, it is good to see the release of a Journey concert dvd featuring the classic line up with Steve Perry, Neal Schon, Jonathan Cain, Ross Valory, and Steve Smith. The Escape Tour dvd captures Journey at the top of their game. Prior to Escape, Journey had been quite popular, but with the release of Escape their popularity soard to new hights. Much of the material on the Escape album is played, 7 of its 10 songs, as well as the hits from Infinity, Evolution, and Departure.The Sound quality of the dvd is very good.

Kirms,"[31, 37]","In just 5 more years who would have guessed that Journey would be putting out their last cd before a 10 year hiatus, Valory and Smith would be gone and pop sappy rock would be flowing through Steve Perry.  This DVD brings at last their concert at a creative turning point for the band.  Gone is Rolie and in comes Cain which brings them their most notable commercial success.  There's not alot of flash here and they play 8 songs from Escape, 3 from Departure, a few solo's, 2 from Evolution and a couple from Infinity (which has to be their best from the Rolie period and most creative and most towards the progressive side leaning towards their previous 3 albums before Perry).  With that said, the 5.1 sound is great and offers something that you couldn't get from the VHS tape or cd.  And, of course, watching it and hearing it is incredible.  It's interesting to note that on the inner sleeve the only albums that are mentioned from Journey are the Steve Perry colaborations, which excludes Dream after Dream from 1981.  It doesn't mention their very first 3 albums or anything from the current Augeri era.  But I guess the fued goes on and it will interesting to see where Perry goes from here.  He is on the new David Pack cd singing back-up, but it is hard to find him out there.  Oh yeah, the tribute to Journey cd was a nice touch with him singing one of Augeri's songs.  That's a twist.

Lately, I've been buying concert DVDs from different eras, including those good ol' days, and it made sense to include Journey, especially since their recent 'rebirth' with Arnel Pineda at center stage has caught my attention.  Well, the verdict is that I really like this DVD, the songs are great and the band performs them with an abundance of energy.  Some things that stood out for me:- The video quality isn't bad, and the sound quality is even better.  Quite acceptable for a concert of this vintage.- The stage show is pleasantly simple and pure, not even much change in lighting.  Just a bunch of great musicians wearing jeans and jumping around with enthusiasm as they play their music for a large live audience.- Steve Perry's voice sounds like it comes from heaven, absolutely soul-stirring.  Yes, Pineda is great too, hat's off to him, but Perry still has an extra something special.- To my ear, from today's vantage point, many of these older Journey songs have a strikingly operatic quality.  And of course, Perry's singing is a big part of that.- I was really impressed with Neal Schon's guitar playing (and I'm a guitarist myself), he's better than I remember.  He makes that guitar sing!Overall, a very enjoyable performance.

947424,A2WJSVSBXEYEF,B000BPK2NE,Jefferson T. Packer,"[69, 70]","Journey's Escape Tour came to the Cleveland Coliseum just a few weeks after my 14th birthday.  I had no car, no money and parents who suspected that things went on at rock concerts that they had to protect me from.  It seemed like the entire neighborhood was going, and at school it was the only thing anyone talked about for the next week.  The girls all had magazine pictures of Steve Perry taped inside their lockers.All I had to sustain me was the ""Escape"" album in LP vinyl, and my friends and I literally wore it out over the next several years, with all of us coming of age in what seemed like months, all to the soundtrack of Journey and a few other bands.  By the time the ""Frontiers"" tour came to town, I was old enough to go but I had moved on to other bands, and besides we all sensed that ""Escape"" had been the pinnacle, and that Journey was morphing into a band for girls.So I am grateful beyond words that MTV happened to capture this night in Houston with such high quality video and sound.  The band is simply at their technical and spiritual peak, and they are riding a wave of unbelievable power since, as Steve Perry mentions during the concert, the ""Escape"" album had gone number one just three weeks earlier.Disco had ended, Progressive was still coming, MTV had arrived but hadn't figured out quite what it was yet, and Journey was the biggest thing in America in 1981.  This DVD captures that moment, and what's truly amazing for us rock connoisseurs is how sparse and basic their stage show is here.  The musicians stand on stage with their gear, they blow our minds out with their playing, Steve Perry runs around and some primitive pyros explode at the beginning and the end, and aside from that, pretty much nothing else happens except that everyone in the audience goes nuts and most of the girls probably wet their pants.

947429,A356RFKNIG043B,B000BPK2NE,K. Swanson,"[5, 5]","If you have ever enjoyed even one tune by Journey, do your ears a flavor and check out this live show from probably the best month of their entire career.Recorded in Houston on the Escape tour in 1981, three weeks after that classic album hit number one, this show is just flat out smokin' from moment one (a killer version of Escape) all the way to the final Perry wail. They are all obviously super-duper-psyched to achieve every rock band's wettest dream: touring behind the number one record on the planet. And man, are these guys happening on this night. Of course, it's all about That Voice.Steve Perry! The dude was a vocal GOD. As a teenager at the time I liked a lot of their tunes, but Journey was lumped in with Foreigner, .38 Special, REO and other ""corporate rock"" bands as just too commercial to be cool. Zeppelin, Sabbath, Beatles, Stones, Who: that was still the stuff that ruled the high school parking lots. Only chicks listened to Journey...which the smart guys took note of, hanging out at the shows and meeting endless girls, while the guys at the Rush and Sabbath shows banged their heads while occasionally noticing the absence of said babes.The girls knew what guys like me passed by way too fast: Journey had the best lead singer, musically, since the mighty Zep itself. Plus Perry knew how to write ultimate chick ballads (Open Arms is STILL the top AOR song), could rock hard when he wanted to, was always musical and really understood how to use his crazy huge voice.Watching this 30 years later, having sung and played guitar for a living for most of the '90s, I can only marvel at Perry's staggering abilities. Not only his range and power, but his incredibly reliable ear. This guy ain't NEVER pitchy, dawg! How do you go for that many soaring notes way up there and never dump one even a quarter tone? Only this guy and Dio seem to know, and Steve uses so little vibrato that he blows even Ronnie James away for sheer technical perfection and tonal intensity.Watch him here for a master class in rock singing; seriously, there's a ton to be learned from this show for any singer. First thing I noticed was how straight his back always is, and how he really opens his throat up at almost all times....hence that seemingly easy power and accuracy. He works the entire stage, almost DLR-style, and hits every dang note dead on even while running. He also anticipates the lyric and puts himself in the right place in the right time, by the drums, keys, etc. The man paid serious attention.Steve is a true vocal artist, and even if you don't dig his music watch how he hits those notes with his whole body; he's as operatic in the best ways as no other rocker except maybe Freddie Mercury. And the aggressive, intense apporach to every note, plus the soaring swoops and runs, make me think of a truly great lead guitarist as much as a singer. Perry's best vocals sound at times to me like a classic David Gilmour solo, tone and all, and that's a supreme musical compliment.Steve was a straight-up professional, and I also love how un-wasted he and the boys are here. Ain't it nice when a band gives you more than your money's worth?Anyhow, enough marveling at Perry. Everyone else in the band is in fine form, especially drummer Steve Smith, whose propulsive groove and tight pocket really make things pop. Schon plays his recorded solos mostly note for note, for better or worse, and while to me he's a little too predictable and generic at times (and nowhere near Perry's level), he still delivers the intensity.Even though Neal was a founding member of Journey, by 1981 this was clearly Perry's band, and he sings so insanely well on this show, with so much passion and precision, that to have it in this quality with nice slow camera work and near-perfect remastered sound is as close to heaven as any hardcore Journey fan could ask for. And even I, a mere Journey enjoyer, must admit that any band would kill to have been in that magic place, on top of the rock world when it still rocked, and to have played a show for posterity that's as tight and crisp as this.Maybe the best thing about this dvd is that the picture and sound are A-1, with almost no quick cuts from one shot to the next to the next, every second. We get a shot of Perry or Schon or whomever for ten or even thirty seconds. Yes!! I want to watch a musician working his ax for a while; I don't want to see how many cuts an editor can make with his. This very early MTV production displays all the right things they would stop doing a few years later, helping kill the art of live rock video in the process. Now it's all nausea-inducing one second cuts.But this near-perfect filming is just the music, with a few nice cheesy screen effects, and that's all we need, and want.If every band had a dvd this perfect, the world would be at peace and we would all be living in perfect harmony.Ok, maybe not, but Steve Perry is still the best lead guitarist to never pick up a guitar.",5,"So tight and right,

947434,A3QHIH7C3H81EH,B000BPK2NE,"Lethe ""lor68""","[0, 2]","Mainly based upon an American Journey's Tour (culminating into a couple of concerts in Houston and Cleveland) supporting the hit album ""Escape"" on 1981, you can find some other sessions within a 4 months effort at MTV, inside the present DVD live (dated 2005). But of course their main show- taken on November 6, 1981 and featuring the most famous line up with Neal Schon, Steve Perry, Jonathan Cain, Ross Valory and Steve Smith- is not always on the most inspiring side of AOR rock. Nevertheless there are always their biggest hit singles...even though- apart from the passion and strong vocal interpretation as well by S. Perry- I'm a little bit disturbed when I listen to a kind of ""boogie rock"" entitled ""Line of fire"" and sometimes tired too, owing to their usual ballads, such as ""Lights"", ""Stay Awhile"", and ""Open Arms"".Anyway- fortunately- ""Mother/Father"" is one of the most ""convincing"" and heavier songs from ""Escape"", and above all it's not a commercial hit!! Then I like the guitar solo by N. Schon within ""Who's Crying Now"", this latter being a ballad in the opening section, but growing by means of the emotional feeling expressed in the guitar line of the following section...at the end I wait for ""Wheel In The Sky"", probably the best example regarding the style of the guitarist; nevertheless the easy melodic soloings by Neal have been often appreciated also in the pop hits. Moreover I like to mention the excellent production quality (if you consider the record dated 1981!!), with the support of MTV, performing a very good job here- as long as you find an additional song, ""The Party's Over"" , combined with the Escape TV Promo (this latter enriched by means of the interviews) , which all together make this product of ""AOR"" music quite an important event. In fact They were able to witness the most melodic moments, according to the typical mood of the early eighties, in the Golden Age of such an interesting American simple rock (however equal to Styx and Boston, just to mention a couple of bands with the same style within that period...).An interesting film for an easy melodic rock-I mean, from a shrewd ever-green band! You know that I prefer the effective prog music genre, in comparison to the world of prog related or AOR music but- talking about Journey- I recognize their importance inside the world of pop music... at the end- for me- it could be enough to think of giving it over an half star in the evaluation, at least!!",3,"An interesting film for an easy melodic rock-I mean, from a shrewd ever-green band!",1275782400,"06 6, 2010",2010,2460,"['Mainly', 'based', 'American', 'Journey', 'Tour', 'culminating', 'couple', 'concerts', 'Houston', 'Cleveland', 'supporting', 'hit', 'album', 'Escape', '1981', 'can', 'find', 'other', 'sessions', '4', 'months', 'effort', 'MTV', 'present', 'DVD', 'live', 'dated', '2005', 'course', 'main', 'show-', 'taken', 'November', '6', '1981', 'featuring', 'most', 'famous', 'line', 'Neal', 'Schon', 'Steve', 'Perry', 'Jonathan', 'Cain', 'Ross', 'Valory', 'Steve', 'Smith-', 'not', 'always', 'most', 'inspiring', 'side', 'AOR', 'rock', 'are', 'always', 'biggest', 'hit', 'singles', 'even', 'though-', 'apart', 'passion', 'strong', 'vocal', 'interpretation', 'well', 'S.', 'Perry-', ""'m"", 'little', 'bit', 'disturbed', 'when', 'listen', 'kind', 'boogie', 'rock', 'entitled', 'Line', 'fire', 'sometimes', 'tired', 'too', 'owing', 'usual', 'ballads', 'such', 'Lights', 'Stay', 'Awhile', 'Open', 'Arms', '.Anyway-', 'fortunately-', 'Mother/Father', 'one', 'most', 'convincing', 'heavier', 'songs', 'Escape', 'not', 'commercial', 'hit', 'Then', 'like', 'guitar', 'solo', 'N.', 'Schon', 'Who', 'Crying', 'Now', 'latter', 'being', 'ballad', 'opening', 'section', 'growing', 'means', 'emotional', 'feeling', 'expressed', 'guitar', 'line', 'following', 'section', 'end', 'wait', 'Wheel', 'Sky', 'probably', 'best', 'example', 'regarding', 'style', 'guitarist', 'easy', 'melodic', 'soloings', 'Neal', 'have', 'been', 'often', 'appreciated', 'also', 'pop', 'Moreover', 'like', 'mention', 'excellent', 'production', 'quality', 'consider', 'record', 'dated', '1981', 'support', 'MTV', 'performing', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'here-', 'as', 'long', 'find', 'additional', 'song', 'Party', 'Over', 'combined', 'Escape', 'TV', 'Promo', 'latter', 'enriched', 'means', 'interviews', 'together', 'make', 'product', 'AOR', 'music', 'important', 'event', 'fact', 'were', 'able', 'witness', 'most', 'melodic', 'moments', 'according', 'typical', 'mood', 'early', 'eighties', 'Golden', 'Age', 'such', 'interesting', 'American', 'simple', 'rock', 'however', 'equal', 'Styx', 'Boston', 'just', 'mention', 'couple', 'bands', 'same', 'style', 'period', '.An', 'interesting', 'film', 'easy', 'melodic', 'rock-I', 'mean', 'shrewd', 'ever-green', 'band', 'know', 'prefer', 'effective', 'prog', 'music', 'genre', 'comparison', 'world', 'prog', 'related', 'AOR', 'music', 'but-', 'talking', 'Journey-', 'recognize', 'importance', 'world', 'pop', 'music', 'end-', 'me-', 'could', 'be', 'enough', 'think', 'giving', 'half', 'star', 'evaluation', 'least']","Journey - Live in Houston 1981, The Escape Tour"

Who else has typed in ""blu-ray live"" and any other host of keyword combinations here at amazon, only to find the same tiny list pop up? I mean, it's Journey in 1981, right? Why isn't this available on blu-ray?Well, having caved in and bought the DVD, I can affirm that this is one instance where blu-ray might actually have diminished the viewing experience. I'm fairly certain that people are taking better concert footage with their cell phones these days. This concert looks like it was shot as an after thought to fill up the empty video cassette that was left over after someone's wedding. Sometimes, it's almost painful to watch. And the band members' jeans, along with flashes of high school talent show stage presence, don't help.Steve Perry is amazing, though.

Being a die-hard Journey fan for many years, I supported the band even in the latest years, with their new lead singer and fine stage show.  Now this show is finally released in November 2005, without acknoledgement from Journey's own website (they were all smiles to accept the star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame, however), it really confirms that this was Journey's true incarnation.  Steve Perry is simply irreplaceable, as this time capsule clearly shows.  Produced by Perry, these tracks were only previously available in audio-CD only as ""Journey's Greatest Hits Live.""  Now in Dolby 5.1 surround with laser sharp picture and sound quality, this is the one to have, or discover Journey for the first time.  Everything was so much better for the band then.  Perry's soulful and powerful vocals (left off MTV's ""25 Greatest Voices"" list in favor of Kurt Cobain; go figure), Jonathan Cain's melodic piano (wonderful solo), Nein Schon's guitar (real seriously great guitar solo, too), Ross Valory's bass (just the same as today).  You really have not heard a drum solo, or drumming throughout, until you've heard Steve ""Machine Gun"" Smith tear through his routine.

In fact, Journey were so big that they opened a few shows for The Rolling Stones (whom retured to the road in 1981 in support of Tattoo You (Journey opened up for Mick and Keith and the lads in 1978 for a few shows as well)) before embarking on the tour in support of their Escape album.This 1981 concert was recorded and filmed at The Houston Summit in Houston, TX that November (with Canadian rockers Loverboy (who had just released their Get Lucky album) opening up for Journey) and this Journey performance originally aired on MTV (when it stood for Music TeleVision, not REALITY TV like it is now).For years, this classic Journey concert was not available on either DVD or VHS nor even on an audio format but it is now. This Journey concert features the classic line up with lead singer Steve Perry, guitarist Neal Schon, then new keyboard player/occasional rhythm guitarist Jonathan Cain, bass player Ross Valory and drummer(and my fellow Bay Stater (Massachusetts) native) Steve Smith.The Escape Tour sees Journey at the top of their game.On this CD and DVD set, the band played eight of the Escape album's ten tracks (the set opening title cut (with a killer fanfare riff to begin the tune), ""Open Arms"", ""Mother Father"", ""Who's Crying Now"", ""Dead or Alive"", ""Don't Stop Believin'"", ""Stone in Love"" and ""Keep on Runnin'"") as well as songs from 1978's Infinity (""Lights"" and set closer ""Wheel in the Sky""), 1979's Evolution (the first encore ""Lovin' Touchin' Squeezin'""), 1980's Departure (""Line of Fire"", ""Where Were You"" and the final encore ""Any Way You Want It"") and the studio track from 1981's double live album Captured (""The Party's Over (Hopelessly In Love)"" which is on the CD only) plus solos from messieurs Cain on the piano as a link between ""Mother Father"" and ""Who's Crying Now"", Smith (who does a superb drum solo which starts at the end of ""Where Were You"") and Schon (whose solo serves as a link between ""Keep on Runnin'"" and ""Wheel In the Sky"").The sound quality of the CD and DVD set is incredible (superbly mixed by Allan Sides and wonderfully remastered by Bob Ludwig) and the digi-pak type packaging, which includes a 16-page booklet is excellent as well.The extras on the DVD portion are interviews filmed during the 1981/82 timeframe with Journey's calssic lineup, the ending credits from when MTV aired the show in 1982, the Escape album promo commercial and photo gallery and all are top notch.Overall, Journey Live in Houston is a great value for your buck. Thank you to Steve Perry for helping restore the true Journey legacy.RECOMMENDED!",5,Journey live at the height of its fame and powers,1299456000,"03 7, 2011",2011,3021,"['Journey', 'Live', 'Houston', '1981', 'Escape', 'Tour', 'CD', 'DVD', 'was', 'released', 'November', '2005.The', 'year', '1981', 'was', 'year', 'rock', 'band', 'Journey', 'based', 'San', 'Fancisco', 'CA', 'ruled', 'American', 'rock', 'music', 'landscape', 'then-latest', 'album', 'Escape', 'hit', '1', 'Billboard', 'album', 'chart', 'were', 'possibly', 'aside', 'Canadian', 'rockers', 'Rush', 'Chicago', 'based', 'rockers', 'Styx', 'best', 'concert', 'act', 'US', 'Canada', 'touring', 'United', 'States', '1981', 'fact', 'Journey', 'were', 'so', 'big', 'opened', 'few', 'shows', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'whom', 'retured', 'road', '1981', 'support', 'Tattoo', 'Journey', 'opened', 'up', 'Mick', 'Keith', 'lads', '1978', 'few', 'shows', 'well', 'embarking', 'tour', 'support', 'Escape', '1981', 'concert', 'was', 'recorded', 'filmed', 'Houston', 'Summit', 'Houston', 'TX', 'November', 'Canadian', 'rockers', 'Loverboy', 'who', 'had', 'just', 'released', 'Get', 'Lucky', 'album', 'opening', 'up', 'Journey', 'Journey', 'performance', 'originally', 'aired', 'MTV', 'when', 'stood', 'Music', 'TeleVision', 'not', 'REALITY', 'TV', 'now', '.For', 'years', 'classic', 'Journey', 'concert', 'was', 'not', 'available', 'DVD', 'VHS', 'even', 'audio', 'format', 'now', 'Journey', 'concert', 'classic', 'line', 'up', 'lead', 'singer', 'Steve', 'Perry', 'guitarist', 'Neal', 'Schon', 'then', 'new', 'keyboard', 'player/occasional', 'rhythm', 'guitarist', 'Jonathan', 'Cain', 'bass', 'player', 'Ross', 'Valory', 'drummer', 'fellow', 'Bay', 'Stater', 'Massachusetts', 'native', 'Steve', 'Smith.The', 'Escape', 'Tour', 'Journey', 'top', 'game.On', 'CD', 'DVD', 'set', 'band', 'played', 'eight', 'Escape', 'album', 'ten', 'tracks', 'set', 'opening', 'title', 'cut', 'killer', 'fanfare', 'riff', 'begin', 'tune', 'Open', 'Arms', 'Father', 'Who', 'Crying', 'Now', 'Dead', 'Alive', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Stop', 'Believin', 'Stone', 'Love', 'Keep', 'Runnin', 'as', 'well', 'songs', '1978', 'Infinity', 'Lights', 'set', 'closer', 'Wheel', 'Sky', '1979', 'Evolution', 'first', 'Lovin', 'Touchin', 'Squeezin', '1980', 'Departure', 'Line', 'Fire', 'Where', 'Were', 'final', 'encore', 'Way', 'Want', 'studio', 'track', '1981', 'double', 'live', 'album', 'Captured', 'Party', 'Over', 'Hopelessly', 'Love', 'CD', 'only', 'solos', 'messieurs', 'Cain', 'piano', 'link', 'Mother', 'Father', 'Who', 'Crying', 'Now', 'Smith', 'who', 'superb', 'drum', 'solo', 'end', 'Where', 'Were', 'Schon', 'solo', 'link', 'Keep', 'Runnin', 'Wheel', 'Sky', '.The', 'sound', 'quality', 'CD', 'DVD', 'set', 'incredible', 'superbly', 'mixed', 'Allan', 'Sides', 'wonderfully', 'remastered', 'Bob', 'Ludwig', 'digi-pak', 'type', 'packaging', '16-page', 'booklet', 'excellent', 'well.The', 'extras', 'DVD', 'portion', 'are', 'interviews', 'filmed', '1981/82', 'timeframe', 'Journey', 'calssic', 'lineup', 'ending', 'credits', 'when', 'MTV', 'aired', 'show', '1982', 'Escape', 'album', 'promo', 'commercial', 'photo', 'gallery', 'are', 'top', 'notch.Overall', 'Journey', 'Live', 'Houston', 'great', 'value', 'buck', 'Thank', 'Steve', 'Perry', 'helping', 'restore', 'true', 'Journey', 'legacy.RECOMMENDED']","Journey - Live in Houston 1981, The Escape Tour"

I don't really consider the second DVD release (Journey 2001) without Steve Perry, because in my opinion it's not the original Journey that I grew up with. Considering the age of this show, you get an amazing 1981 concert DVD from their Escape Tour with an impressive picture and excellent Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound. Overall it's a great show and any Journey fan would be happy to have it in their DVD concert collection. DVD track list from Journey: Live in Houston 1981 - Escape Tour is listed below.1.
