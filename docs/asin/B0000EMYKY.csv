781711,A2CZPM110DW516,B0000EMYKY,"Brian W. Fairbanks ""Brian W. Fairbanks""","[18, 18]","Four more classic Sherlock Holmes mysteries from the vaults of Universal Studios. Somewhere in the 12 film series, the master detective simply had to solve a mystery within the claustrophic atmosphere of a train (the perfect setting for intrigue), and he does it here in ""Terror By Night."" The equally entertaining ""Pursuit to Algiers"" finds Holmes and Watson on an ocean liner. Despite these novel and exciting settings, the best film in this set is ""Woman In Green."" The chauvenistic sleuth was often at his best when matching wits with the opposite sex, but what makes this entry particularly outstanding is the appearance of Henry Daniell as Professor Moriarty. The brilliantly saturnine character actor had already made two appearances in the Holmes series but here he tackles the role he was born to play.""Dressed to Kill"" is the last film in the series and, not surprisingly, it shows signs of fatigue, but Rathbone is as brilliant as ever.",4,Sherlock Holmes is back,1072656000,"12 29, 2003",2003,947,"['Four', 'more', 'classic', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'mysteries', 'vaults', 'Universal', 'Studios', 'Somewhere', '12', 'film', 'series', 'master', 'detective', 'simply', 'had', 'solve', 'mystery', 'claustrophic', 'atmosphere', 'train', 'perfect', 'setting', 'intrigue', 'here', 'Terror', 'Night', 'equally', 'entertaining', 'Pursuit', 'Algiers', 'Holmes', 'Watson', 'ocean', 'liner', 'novel', 'exciting', 'settings', 'best', 'film', 'set', 'Woman', 'Green', 'chauvenistic', 'sleuth', 'was', 'often', 'best', 'when', 'matching', 'wits', 'opposite', 'sex', 'what', 'entry', 'particularly', 'outstanding', 'appearance', 'Henry', 'Daniell', 'Professor', 'Moriarty', 'brilliantly', 'saturnine', 'character', 'actor', 'had', 'already', 'made', 'two', 'appearances', 'Holmes', 'series', 'here', 'role', 'was', 'born', 'play', 'Dressed', 'Kill', 'last', 'film', 'series', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'signs', 'fatigue', 'Rathbone', 'as', 'brilliant', 'ever']",Sherlock Holmes Collection: Volume 3: (Dressed to Kill / In Pursuit to Algiers / Terror By Night / The Woman in Green)

And he was in fine form in ""Sherlock Holmes Collection Volume 3,"" which varies from merely okay to absolutely brilliant.""Dressed to Kill"" has a friend of Watson's (Nigel Bruce) telling Holmes of a bizarre crime -- someone broke into his house, and stole a worthless music box from a valuable collection. Then the man is murdered -- and three plain little music boxes are the key to solving an elaborate mystery.""Terror By Night"" has Holmes hired to look after a valuable diamond belonging to a wealthy woman, as she travels back to Scotland. Of course, the diamond gets stolen and the woman's son is murdered in the attempt, and now Holmes discovers that the murderer is an old enemy.""The Woman In Green"" deals with a serial killer -- four women have died, and each time a finger was removed. The police think that it's just a baffling series of crimes, but Holmes knows better -- and he suspects that his old, supposedly-dead nemesis Moriarty (Henry Daniell) is involved.Finally there's ""In Pursuit to Algiers,"" in which the king of Ravenia has been murdered -- and now his son is in danger too. On the cruise to his homeland, the young king pretends to be a relative of Watson's -- but Holmes still has to guard him against an array of potential murderers.These were some of the later Holmes adventures, often not based (or loosely based) on Arthur Conan Doyle's works. But even the weakest (""Dressed to Kill"") is still an enjoyable mystery, with some amusing moments and unexpected twists. They're just not as brilliant as Doyle's, that's all.And they are solidly written and directed, with plenty of interesting settings, from the claustrophobic train to Scotland to a hypnotists' society. And the filmmakers throw in some wonderful little twists, such as a switcheroo Holmes plays on his enemy in ""Terror By Night.""Rathbone is still best known for playing Holmes, and he does it well -- cool, cerebral, but with a gentle humor and warmth in scenes such as the little girl's rescue. Bruce doesn't fare as well, since the capable Watson is portrayed as a kindly bumbler, but he does a solid enough job with a poorly-portrayed character.""The Sherlock Holmes Collection Volume 3"" is a bit less solid than the other collections, but still very nicely done. Definitely worth watching.",4,Dressed for terror,1170720000,"02 6, 2007",2007,2385,"['Basil', 'Rathbone', 'one', 'two', 'great', 'Holmes', 'actors', 'movie', 'history', 'other', 'being', 'Jeremy', 'Brett', 'was', 'fine', 'form', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'Collection', 'Volume', '3', 'merely', 'okay', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'Dressed', 'Kill', 'friend', 'Watson', 'Nigel', 'Bruce', 'telling', 'Holmes', 'bizarre', 'crime', 'someone', 'broke', 'house', 'stole', 'worthless', 'music', 'box', 'valuable', 'collection', 'Then', 'man', 'murdered', 'three', 'plain', 'little', 'music', 'boxes', 'are', 'key', 'solving', 'elaborate', 'mystery', 'Terror', 'Night', 'Holmes', 'hired', 'look', 'valuable', 'diamond', 'belonging', 'wealthy', 'woman', 'back', 'Scotland', 'course', 'diamond', 'stolen', 'woman', 'son', 'murdered', 'attempt', 'now', 'Holmes', 'discovers', 'murderer', 'old', 'enemy', 'Woman', 'Green', 'deals', 'serial', 'killer', 'four', 'women', 'have', 'died', 'time', 'finger', 'was', 'removed', 'police', 'think', 'just', 'baffling', 'series', 'crimes', 'Holmes', 'better', 'old', 'supposedly-dead', 'nemesis', 'Moriarty', 'Henry', 'Daniell', 'involved.Finally', 'Pursuit', 'Algiers', 'king', 'Ravenia', 'been', 'murdered', 'now', 'son', 'danger', 'too', 'cruise', 'homeland', 'young', 'king', 'pretends', 'be', 'relative', 'Watson', 'Holmes', 'still', 'guard', 'array', 'potential', 'murderers.These', 'were', 'later', 'Holmes', 'adventures', 'often', 'not', 'based', 'loosely', 'based', 'Arthur', 'Conan', 'Doyle', 'works', 'even', 'weakest', 'Dressed', 'Kill', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'mystery', 'amusing', 'moments', 'unexpected', 'twists', ""'re"", 'just', 'not', 'as', 'brilliant', 'Doyle', 'all.And', 'are', 'solidly', 'written', 'directed', 'plenty', 'interesting', 'settings', 'claustrophobic', 'train', 'Scotland', 'hypnotists', 'society', 'filmmakers', 'throw', 'wonderful', 'little', 'twists', 'such', 'switcheroo', 'Holmes', 'enemy', 'Terror', 'Night', 'Rathbone', 'still', 'best', 'known', 'playing', 'Holmes', 'well', 'cool', 'cerebral', 'gentle', 'humor', 'warmth', 'scenes', 'such', 'little', 'girl', 'rescue', 'Bruce', ""n't"", 'fare', 'as', 'well', 'capable', 'Watson', 'portrayed', 'kindly', 'bumbler', 'solid', 'enough', 'job', 'poorly-portrayed', 'character', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'Collection', 'Volume', '3', 'bit', 'less', 'solid', 'other', 'collections', 'still', 'very', 'nicely', 'done', 'Definitely', 'worth', 'watching']",Sherlock Holmes Collection: Volume 3: (Dressed to Kill / In Pursuit to Algiers / Terror By Night / The Woman in Green)

Menta, Jr.","[2, 2]","With four high-concept plots anchoring each of these four final ""Sherlock Holmes"" movies to feature Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, viewers are perhaps not getting the depth of mood and story of the previous installments.  But at least the high concepts are fun and pretty interesting:""The Woman in Green"" features a serial killer who removes a finger from each of his victims.  How does he tie in with the femme fatale of the title?""Pursuit to Algiers"" pits Holmes and Watson against a variety of assassins out to kill Holmes' client, a heir to a European throne.  And it's all set on a cruise ship!""Terror By Night"" is a classic-style whodunit set on a speeding train. Hey, if the tight quarters of a ship made for a good story before, why not try another conveyance?""Dressed to Kill"" features a race against time, between Holmes and a deadly crime ring, to procure four music boxes containing a secret that could bring down the U.K.My grumbling at the outset is essentially nitpicking.  These four nicely restored installments are essential viewing for Sherlock Holmes enthusiasts, and brought the series to a close in perfectly fine form.
