953992,A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2,B000BZISRQ,"Kevin L. Nenstiel ""omnivore""","[0, 0]","I waver in my opinion on this season: on the one hand, we deeper than ever into Jarod's background and his relationship to the Centre.  Questions which have lingered since the start of the series finally get answered.  The story starts to open up to insight.  On the other hand, the series has become self-referential, soap operatic, and too cool for the room.The explosion that ended the second season has left several people changed.  Jarod is an angrier character, no longer the wide-eyed innocent who broke out, while the Centre crew can no longer deny that their employers are corrupt.  Jarod adjusts his goals to be more realistic, while his pursuers work both sides against the middle, trying to tease out the secrets that loom over them and threaten to destroy them.Along the way, Jarod pushes himself further than before, with romantic entanglements and shows of force that the series has so far avoided.  We also get more into the other principals' families, including Sydney's grown son, Broots' daughter, and the intricate maze of the Parker family.  Miss Parker falls in love, imagine that.  And we see the characters' roots run deeper than ever before.But many episodes seem uninterested in keeping audiences engaged.  Jarod seems like a guest in several episodes as his ""pretends"" become less important than the continuing arc.  One episode links with the series ""The Profiler,"" which feels like a Hail Mary play.  The series permits comedy, which also torpedoed ""The X-Files.""  And, like much sci-fi, the show refers back to itself so often that, if you miss an episode, you're sunk.Overall, this feels like a transition season.  The creative team owns a mature show, and they don't know what to do with it.  Thus they treat it very tentatively, try ill-conceived experiments, and lose track of their audience.  I can't say it's bad, and it's certainly better than the drivel produced today, but compared to the first two seasons, this one feels adrift.",3,A Show In Transition,1282089600,"08 18, 2010",2010,1969,"['waver', 'opinion', 'season', 'one', 'hand', 'deeper', 'ever', 'Jarod', 'background', 'relationship', 'Centre', 'Questions', 'have', 'lingered', 'start', 'series', 'finally', 'get', 'answered', 'story', 'open', 'up', 'insight', 'other', 'hand', 'series', 'become', 'self-referential', 'soap', 'operatic', 'too', 'cool', 'room.The', 'explosion', 'ended', 'second', 'season', 'left', 'several', 'people', 'changed', 'Jarod', 'angrier', 'character', 'no', 'longer', 'wide-eyed', 'innocent', 'who', 'broke', 'out', 'Centre', 'crew', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'deny', 'employers', 'are', 'corrupt', 'Jarod', 'goals', 'be', 'more', 'realistic', 'pursuers', 'work', 'sides', 'middle', 'trying', 'tease', 'out', 'secrets', 'loom', 'threaten', 'destroy', 'way', 'Jarod', 'further', 'before', 'romantic', 'entanglements', 'shows', 'force', 'series', 'so', 'far', 'avoided', 'also', 'get', 'more', 'other', 'principals', 'families', 'including', 'Sydney', 'grown', 'son', 'Broots', 'daughter', 'intricate', 'maze', 'Parker', 'family', 'Miss', 'Parker', 'love', 'imagine', 'see', 'characters', 'roots', 'run', 'deeper', 'ever', 'before.But', 'many', 'episodes', 'seem', 'uninterested', 'keeping', 'audiences', 'engaged', 'Jarod', 'guest', 'several', 'episodes', 'pretends', 'become', 'less', 'important', 'continuing', 'arc', 'One', 'episode', 'series', 'Profiler', 'Hail', 'Mary', 'play', 'series', 'comedy', 'also', 'torpedoed', 'X-Files', 'much', 'sci-fi', 'show', 'back', 'so', 'often', 'miss', 'episode', ""'re"", 'sunk.Overall', 'feels', 'transition', 'season', 'creative', 'team', 'mature', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'Thus', 'treat', 'very', 'tentatively', 'try', 'ill-conceived', 'experiments', 'lose', 'track', 'audience', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'bad', 'certainly', 'better', 'drivel', 'produced', 'today', 'compared', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'one', 'adrift']",N/A

Even more disturbing is the news that Brigitte has toward the end of the season, and the beginning of her marriage to Mr. Parker.The end of the season has the most recognizable of the young flashback Jarods (Ryan Merriman) comes face-to-face with his modern day counterpart after Jarod discovers a Centre plot to clone him.
