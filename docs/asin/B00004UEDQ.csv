552354,A1AXHNRDJEQ0B,B00004UEDQ,Adi Adler,"[4, 5]","The basic story of the movie is as cheesy as they make them: Gwen (Sandra Bullock) loves going out with her boyfriend, having fun, drinking heavily and using other substances. After ruining her sister's wedding, during which she crashes a car into a house, Gwen is sentenced to 28 days in jail - or in rehab. Now try to remember all the cheesy stuff Hollywood had ever taught us about rehab - and that would probably describe the rest of the film.So why the 5 starts? Because even with all this gooey cheese, the movie does have a few shining moments. One of the issues that isn't obvious in the first watching is how sheltered the addicts are in the clinic, and how tough it is for them to sometimes deal with the outside world as ex - addicts. There's a scene where a mother has to face her 2 kids in 'family sessions', and she is torn between being their mother who wants to encourage them to speak, and having to deal with her feelings about what they say. Gwen also has a tough decision when she gets back home - whether to rejoin her boyfriend and her old crowd. On another occasion, Eddie, a big baseball star, is glad to have a few minutes' reminder of his previous fame and glory by giving a couple of kids who recognized him an autograph, but is uncomfortable when they ask him where his car is (having arrived in a bus with 'Rehab Center' written all over it). Their dad tries to resolve the situation by shoo - ing them into the car, but causes Eddie even further embarresment...Overall, this movie is reccomended to people who like Sandra Bullok and the light comedies she usually performs in.",5,"Comic, with quite a few moments of drama...",1035849600,"10 29, 2002",2002,1606,"['basic', 'story', 'movie', 'as', 'cheesy', 'make', 'Gwen', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'going', 'out', 'boyfriend', 'having', 'fun', 'drinking', 'heavily', 'using', 'other', 'substances', 'ruining', 'sister', 'wedding', 'car', 'house', 'Gwen', 'sentenced', '28', 'days', 'jail', 'rehab', 'Now', 'try', 'remember', 'cheesy', 'stuff', 'Hollywood', 'had', 'ever', 'taught', 'rehab', 'would', 'probably', 'describe', 'rest', 'film.So', 'why', '5', 'starts', 'even', 'gooey', 'cheese', 'movie', 'have', 'few', 'shining', 'moments', 'One', 'issues', ""n't"", 'obvious', 'first', 'watching', 'how', 'sheltered', 'addicts', 'are', 'clinic', 'how', 'tough', 'sometimes', 'deal', 'outside', 'world', 'ex', 'addicts', 'scene', 'where', 'mother', 'face', '2', 'kids', ""'family"", 'sessions', 'torn', 'being', 'mother', 'who', 'encourage', 'speak', 'having', 'deal', 'feelings', 'what', 'say', 'Gwen', 'also', 'tough', 'decision', 'when', 'back', 'home', 'rejoin', 'boyfriend', 'old', 'crowd', 'occasion', 'Eddie', 'big', 'baseball', 'star', 'glad', 'have', 'few', 'minutes', 'reminder', 'previous', 'fame', 'glory', 'giving', 'couple', 'kids', 'who', 'recognized', 'autograph', 'uncomfortable', 'when', 'ask', 'where', 'car', 'having', 'arrived', 'bus', ""'Rehab"", 'Center', 'written', 'dad', 'tries', 'resolve', 'situation', 'shoo', 'ing', 'car', 'Eddie', 'even', 'further', 'embarresment', 'Overall', 'movie', 'reccomended', 'people', 'who', 'Sandra', 'Bullok', 'light', 'comedies', 'usually']",28 Days

She plays an alcoholic who is placed in a rehab center for, well you guessed it 28 days. I think Bullock is at her best when she does drama, I love her comdies as well but she expands her talent and growth as an actress in dramatic roles. This film does have funny moments from time to time but it is mainly a hard-hitting drama. The scene where Bullock is in the withdrawal period of her addiction is real and heartbreaking. She is and probably will never be recognized as a gifted performer, she should have been nominated for an award, like the golden globes or something. 28 Days is quirky, spunky, and cute just like Sandy!",5,"""I have enough stories, I want a life!""",1147824000,"05 17, 2006",2006,723,"['28', 'Days', 'starring', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'was', 'courageous', 'take', 'challenging', 'role', 'alcoholic', 'who', 'placed', 'rehab', 'center', 'well', 'guessed', '28', 'days', 'think', 'Bullock', 'best', 'when', 'drama', 'love', 'comdies', 'well', 'talent', 'growth', 'actress', 'dramatic', 'roles', 'film', 'have', 'funny', 'moments', 'time', 'time', 'mainly', 'hard-hitting', 'drama', 'scene', 'where', 'Bullock', 'withdrawal', 'period', 'addiction', 'real', 'heartbreaking', 'probably', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'recognized', 'gifted', 'performer', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'nominated', 'award', 'golden', 'globes', 'something', '28', 'Days', 'quirky', 'spunky', 'cute', 'just', 'Sandy']",28 Days
552356,A2WN1QF8GSVHYV,B00004UEDQ,Altmed,"[3, 3]","Moving story about not only a woman who gets thrown into rehab, but also who has repressed her feelings, her life and finds herself maturing into an adult after drinking her younger life away. When she first gets into rehab, it's not only a typical scene that one might see in a rehab facility, but also one where, since the stunting of her emotional, responsible and relationship senses are that of a young, out of control child who raised herself. Through the movie, she learns how to be alive, how to be sensitive, that the man she thought was so great for her isn't at all and why, and she gets the beginnings of how to grow, get in touch with not only her feelings, but learns what is not good for her and to walk away. She learns to ask for help from those who are healthy and to walk from those who are not, slowly, and through a process that we can only wish some people would get, yet without the tragedy (although that's how some people must learn it, as for some they simply don't see it until they really hurt someone (or even kills them in some people's lives.)This isn't only a good story for alcoholics or drug addicts, but also one for those who haven't grown up as adults for whatever reason. To learn that people make mistakes, to learn that human touch and feelings are really what life is about, not the girl or guy with the nice suit or those who are trying to make an appearance of having money, ""friends"", or the potential of the mansion on the hill, the so-called ""Glamorous life."" She grows to see through all the BS and get real with herself, get in touch with her feelings, realize that being able to be vulnerable is the best gift she can not only give to herself, but also to those around her, and she learns not only how to be a friend to others, but how to recognize who her friends really are.Great flick they outta show and discuss in high schools and colleges (although there are some parts that are graphic - drug use, etc., but then if we are real about it, most kids are seeing this stuff to one degree or another anyhow!)The lessons in this movie come SO late in life for some people, and for some not at all, living lives that are akward, fake, idealized, but then these people never really are happy on the inside, nor do they know how to really connect with other people. An awesome gift for someone who needs to grow before they can really feel what it is to have a family relationship, a true friend, a real life and be happy with who they really are (weather they hide in anxiety, drugs, alcohol, self-indulgence, or whatever it is that keeps them from being who they really are and not trying to put on a mask to feel OK or better than others. To simply be happy with who they are - monetarily rich or poor, healthy or sick, no matter what it is that they are trying to escape by the egotistical ""look at me, look at my [whatever], look at what I have"" syndrome that keeps SO many people from true happiness, and is sad to watch, as these people don't really feel, are not in touch with their feelings, and miss out on what life is really about and unfortunately often times self-medicate with alcohol, drugs, sex, gossip, talking to others as though they don't know anything (the ""know it all"" syndrome) whatever to make themselves feel good about themselves, and that often has other people who are centered in their lives dropping them by the wayside, as they don't care for the drama.",5,"A ""coming of age"" story of people who are learning to grow up at an older age",1196035200,"11 26, 2007",2007,3433,"['Moving', 'story', 'not', 'only', 'woman', 'who', 'thrown', 'rehab', 'also', 'who', 'repressed', 'feelings', 'life', 'maturing', 'adult', 'drinking', 'younger', 'life', 'away', 'When', 'first', 'rehab', 'not', 'only', 'typical', 'scene', 'one', 'might', 'see', 'rehab', 'facility', 'also', 'one', 'where', 'stunting', 'emotional', 'responsible', 'relationship', 'senses', 'are', 'young', 'control', 'child', 'who', 'raised', 'movie', 'how', 'be', 'alive', 'how', 'be', 'sensitive', 'man', 'thought', 'was', 'so', 'great', ""n't"", 'why', 'beginnings', 'how', 'grow', 'get', 'touch', 'not', 'only', 'feelings', 'what', 'not', 'good', 'walk', 'away', 'ask', 'help', 'who', 'are', 'healthy', 'walk', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'slowly', 'process', 'can', 'only', 'wish', 'people', 'would', 'get', 'yet', 'tragedy', 'how', 'people', 'must', 'learn', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'really', 'hurt', 'someone', 'even', 'kills', 'people', 'lives', ""n't"", 'only', 'good', 'story', 'alcoholics', 'drug', 'addicts', 'also', 'one', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'grown', 'up', 'adults', 'reason', 'learn', 'people', 'make', 'mistakes', 'learn', 'human', 'touch', 'feelings', 'are', 'really', 'what', 'life', 'about', 'not', 'girl', 'guy', 'nice', 'suit', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'make', 'appearance', 'having', 'money', 'friends', 'potential', 'mansion', 'hill', 'so-called', 'Glamorous', 'life', 'see', 'BS', 'get', 'real', 'get', 'touch', 'feelings', 'realize', 'being', 'able', 'be', 'vulnerable', 'best', 'gift', 'can', 'not', 'only', 'give', 'herself', 'also', 'not', 'only', 'how', 'be', 'friend', 'others', 'how', 'recognize', 'who', 'friends', 'really', 'are.Great', 'flick', 'outta', 'show', 'discuss', 'high', 'schools', 'colleges', 'are', 'parts', 'are', 'graphic', 'drug', 'use', 'etc.', 'then', 'are', 'real', 'most', 'kids', 'are', 'seeing', 'stuff', 'one', 'degree', 'anyhow', 'lessons', 'movie', 'come', 'SO', 'late', 'life', 'people', 'not', 'living', 'lives', 'are', 'akward', 'fake', 'idealized', 'then', 'people', 'never', 'really', 'are', 'happy', 'inside', 'do', 'know', 'how', 'really', 'connect', 'other', 'people', 'awesome', 'gift', 'someone', 'who', 'grow', 'can', 'really', 'feel', 'what', 'have', 'family', 'relationship', 'true', 'friend', 'real', 'life', 'be', 'happy', 'who', 'really', 'are', 'hide', 'anxiety', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'self-indulgence', 'whatever', 'being', 'who', 'really', 'are', 'not', 'trying', 'put', 'mask', 'feel', 'OK', 'better', 'others', 'simply', 'be', 'happy', 'who', 'are', 'monetarily', 'poor', 'healthy', 'sick', 'matter', 'what', 'are', 'trying', 'escape', 'egotistical', 'look', 'look', '[', ']', 'look', 'what', 'have', 'syndrome', 'SO', 'many', 'people', 'true', 'happiness', 'sad', 'watch', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'feel', 'are', 'not', 'touch', 'feelings', 'out', 'what', 'life', 'really', 'about', 'unfortunately', 'often', 'self-medicate', 'alcohol', 'drugs', 'sex', 'gossip', 'talking', 'others', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'know', 'syndrome', 'make', 'feel', 'good', 'often', 'other', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'centered', 'lives', 'dropping', 'wayside', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'drama']",28 Days
552357,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00004UEDQ,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","I've seen this film a few times (I even saw it twice in the theater) and walking away from it I feel the same way every time.  This is a good film that just lands on the wrong side of great thanks to a few pacing issues.  You know, I really enjoy this film and find all the performances, especially Bullock's, to be strong and focused and intriguing; but the film has a few spots that just seem to lag along forever.  If the film had been tightened just a little (and maybe a few of the clich&eacute;s flipped on their heads) then this film could have been one of the best of the year.That said, Bullock would easily make my top ten Lead Actress ballot for 2000.The film revolves around Gwen, a grown woman who acts very much like a child thanks to her addictions to pills and booze, not to mention the strong influence from her equally immature (and self centered) boyfriend Jasper.  When she unintentionally (yet most likely not really regretfully) ruins her sisters wedding thanks to her `issues', she finds herself spending a month in rehab where she starts to find herself by witnessing the effect her life has on others as well as getting to see herself through others eyes.  The film may go in a very predictable direction (the character arcs for Jasper, Gwen and one unlucky patient are very `by the book') but it feels very authentic and relatable from start to finish.Well, except for the weird love angle involving Eddie, the baseball player.In the end though, it is not the script itself that gets the negative point, or maybe it is, but not the plot aspect of the script.  There are just a few scenes that needed to be cut in order to keep the film from lulling and leaving holes of disinterest.  It's sad when a film can grab you and then kind of push you away almost simultaneously.It's a balanceing act that this film didn't quite master.Still, the acting is rather remarkable, especially when you consider the type of film this COULD have become.  When you think of Sandra Bullock you don't really think of dramatic actress.  You think of bubbly and cute romantic comedies.  Well, now you think of Oscar Winning actress (congrats Sandra, even if NO ONE should have beaten Mulligan this year!), but at the time this was released Sandra was not really known for her skills in the dramatic department.  She SOARS here.  She really understands how to use her knack for endearing the audience as well as this rich element of surprise into creating a beautifully sincere character.  The ensemble is actually very well used, from the selfish sensuality that envelopes Dominic West to the awkward heartbreak that swallows Azura Skye; all the way to Steve Buscemi and the ridiculously underused Mike O'Malley.Of course, there is always one who just steals every scene, and here that is Alan Tudyk.I totally recommend this film.  I wish that I could say it was perfect and give it an A, but a B+ is pretty good and this film more than deserves that grade.  Sandra is a star (we all know that) and this may be her finest performance (although I am still VERY partial to her work in `While You Were Sleeping') so see it for her performance if nothing else.

She also seems to be hooked on painkillers. After ruining her sister's wedding, then stealing a limosene and drunkenly crashing it into a house, she (although this is not shown in the film), is sentenced to 28 days in rehab as an alternative to jail. In rehab, she meets some interesting characters with various addictions, and eventually starts to own up to her problems and begin her recovery.The rehab characters, who each curiously show us about 30 seconds of insight, seem promising, but what we learn about them is vague. The lame chanting in the rehab center is silly, in that it is never explained why people buy into it so readily. At times the film played like an educational video about the dangers of alcohol/drug addiction, but even falls short there, as the center clearly is lacking in addressing some areas of treatment. Some performances are decent, while others are not so good. What happens after the 28 days are up, are we to simply assume what her life is going to be like?

There are still some typical ""Sandra"" moments, but for the most part in this movie, you forget you are watching her, and it's a great film. This is a comedy.I have this DVD and watched it with commentary. I must say the director came off like a complete ass, but maybe she had a bad day. There are other cute features, like instructions on how to make a gum-wrapper chain like Sandra makes in the movie.Basic storyline:Gwen is a party girl who gets busted for a DUI. She is sentenced to rehab. At first she thinks rehab is whack and cheesy. She doesnt participate with the others, and has her party-boy boyfriend sneak her drugs. But then she starts to think she really may have a problem. Will Gwen straighten up, or continue with her partying ways? Will she accept the proposal of her drunk-druggie boyfriend?This movie is above all a comedy. The addicts will make you laugh, Gwen's reaction to them will make you laugh. Steve Buschemi plays a rehab counselor, and while he isn't funny in this role, he is interesting.There are a few sub-plots. Gwen's rehab roomie is a teenage heroin addict. Also, a major-league pitcher (sex addict, druggie) comes to rehab and bonds with Gwen. These arent too detracting from Gwen and in fact it would be boring if the whole movie was just about her.I don't think this movie did so well, and that's why you can get the DVD for cheap.

552367,A2PBV1899CX3TE,B00004UEDQ,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[0, 0]","Before The Blind Side hit it big, Sandra Bullock was an undervalued asset. She made a lot of films, some good, some awful, but she got blamed for the failures, and never got credit for her good performances. Since winning the Oscar and then being cheated on by Jesse James, the public's sympathy has shifted 180 degrees. For a while there it was 24/7 Bullock, Bullock, Bullock on the airwaves, all day/every day. Critics like me are digging up films from the archive and going back to uncover any forgotten gems we may have missed. 28 Days is not the mother lode, it is just a load of Bullock.-------------------------------------------Gwen Cummings: Is that available stitched on a pillow somewhere?=============================During filming in New York Sandra Bullock stayed in the recently departed Dennis Hopper's apartment and that alone should have inspired the young thespian. Her method of acting involved downing a triple espresso before any scene that required her character to have uncontrollable shakes. Is that how Hopper did it in Blue Velvet? Bullock is allergic to horses, but one scene of equine therapy required her to gain a horse's trust so it would allow her to bend the horse's leg. In spite of her allergies, she bent it. What a trouper.-----------------------------Betty: Tonight's lecture: Are you a blackout drunk, or don't you remember?==================Betty Thomas, who was an officer on Hill Street Blues, and also acted in such films as Troop Beverly Hills, has stepped behind the camera where she has directed The Brady Bunch Movie and others of that caliber. She also directed Private Parts, the bio pic about shock jock Howard Stern. She is no Orson Welles, but knows how to serve up some light hearted fare such as 28 Days.OK, it is not so bad in a kind of made-for-TV movie, after school special, sit com level acting kind of way. A light hearted romp through rehab. It's no Leaving Las Vegas, Days of Wine and Roses, Rachael Getting Married, or When a Man Loves a Woman. Sandra Bullock has a certain ineffable charm, and the cast of characters are all kind of cute in their own peculiar ways. Alan Tudyk plays Gerhardt, an extremely odd character who improvises a strange monologue about forks in the road. He is perhaps the wackiest neighbor, the Cosmo Kramer, if you will, of 28 Days; but the ever so slightly less odd characters anchor the story.Dominic West plays Jasper, her boyfriend, her enabler, her co dependent. The audience, and eventually Gwen Cummings can see that he is not very helpful to Gwen in her quest for sobriety. Viggo Mortensen plays Eddie Boone, a baseball player with substance abuse issues. He is your average jock, except that he is a secret soap opera fan, showing his softer side. They created a soap opera within the movie, and it was called Santa Cruz. Also a big fan of Santa Cruz was Gwen's roommate Andrea (Azura Skye). Mike O'Malley plays one of the other rehabbers, and he can currently be seen as Kurt's dad on Glee.Steve Buscemi is in this playing a counselor called Cornell. He does an adequate job, but it is not up to the level of his Theodore Donald 'Donny' in 1998's The Big Lebowski. But bottom line, what is?------------------------------Cornell: This isn't a way to live.

552369,AZVEPWRYOFBX5,B00004UEDQ,Charity Bishop,"[0, 0]","Gwen Cummings (Sandra Bullock) is out of control. A self-proclaimed Alcoholic and part-time drug user, she has completely destroyed her sister's wedding. After arriving forty-five minutes late as the maid of honor, making an embarrassingly bad toast, slap-dancing on the floor, demolishing the four-layer wedding cake, and finally stealing a limousine and driving it to its destruction (all on the intent of 'fixing it')... Gwen finds herself sentenced to twenty-eight days in rehab or jail. It's her choice and obviously... she chooses rehab.Her roommate is a potentially screwed-up teenage girl with a passion for soap operas but a good heart. Slowly Gwen begins to befriend and understand Andrea while finding the other people in her 'group' almost unbearable. There's the misunderstood, stereotyped gay man (in this account a German), a woman mentally abused by her husband's affairs, alcoholics, druggies, cutters... all manner of person seeking help and/or salvation to their incontrollable urges. Only Gwen is rebellious, but she makes the mistake of asking where she can get high... right in front of her camp counselor, who informs her that any mess-up's will send her to the alternative. In an uphill battle, Gwen must choose between what 'feels good' for the moment -- and her live-high-life with her live-in boyfriend -- or to patch up the misshapen hole that is left of her life and find reconciliation with her sister. As Lily herself proclaimed, 'Sometimes, Gwen, you make it really difficult to love you.'The choice isn't that apparent at the first, but soon Gwen is forced into making a decision. She takes more time to understand and help Andrea, who is a secret cutter in times of torment; she also befriends a pro-ball player who admits himself for alcohol rehab. But the time is coming when Gwen must face her sister and try desperately to patch up a broken relationship... after all, she did screw up her sister's wedding, and that isn't easy to apologize for. Overall, the film has a good heart. It casts drugs, sex, and alcohol in a bad light. Unfortunately, it also laughs at them. There are several implied sexual scenes -- two of which are seen in passing in an elevator between patients, another with a man coming half-dressed out of a woman's room -- and lots of innuendos. Andrea's soap is desperately bad, with bed-hopping characters (only hinted-at with dialogue) and a wink at a sexual relationship between unknowing half-siblings. When Andrea is released from rehab, Gwen and her friends do a mock parody of the show that hints at these various discrepancies.There's brief rear nudity, implications of past improprieties, and some immodesty. Overlooking the sensual current that flows through much of the film, there's also bad language (one f-word and many mild profanities, as well as repetitive uses of Oh, my God!) and substance abuse. Gwen nearly kills herself by trying to rescue the drugs she threw out the window only hours before. Boyish jealousy comes to blows. There are a lot of flashbacks as Gwen begins to remember the past... her childhood with an alcoholic mother. There's also a drug-induced suicide that leaves emotional scars on many of our prominent characters.There are a lot of elements of good in the film, but in all honestly it shoots itself in the foot with sensuality and brief profanity. I was able to look past the flaws and find the lessons tucked away in the film's packaging, but those looking for a fun Sandra Bullock film like While You Were Sleeping or Miss Congeniality will be disappointed. The laughs are uncomfortable, but the heart-tugging moments of reconciliation and change very real. At the risk of giving the ending away (which seems to end prematurely) Gwen does choose to abandon all ties with her past and walk 'cleanly' into the future. 28 Days tries very hard to be both comedy and drama, but winds up being much more serious than comical.",3,Parental Review,1363824000,"03 21, 2013",2013,3923,"['Gwen', 'Cummings', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'control', 'self-proclaimed', 'Alcoholic', 'part-time', 'drug', 'user', 'completely', 'destroyed', 'sister', 'wedding', 'arriving', 'forty-five', 'minutes', 'late', 'maid', 'honor', 'making', 'embarrassingly', 'bad', 'toast', 'slap-dancing', 'floor', 'demolishing', 'four-layer', 'wedding', 'cake', 'finally', 'stealing', 'limousine', 'driving', 'destruction', 'intent', ""'fixing"", 'Gwen', 'sentenced', 'twenty-eight', 'days', 'rehab', 'jail', 'choice', 'obviously', 'rehab.Her', 'roommate', 'potentially', 'screwed-up', 'teenage', 'girl', 'passion', 'soap', 'operas', 'good', 'heart', 'Slowly', 'Gwen', 'befriend', 'understand', 'Andrea', 'finding', 'other', 'people', ""'group"", 'almost', 'unbearable', 'misunderstood', 'stereotyped', 'gay', 'man', 'account', 'German', 'woman', 'mentally', 'abused', 'husband', 'affairs', 'alcoholics', 'druggies', 'cutters', 'manner', 'person', 'seeking', 'help', 'and/or', 'salvation', 'incontrollable', 'urges', 'Only', 'Gwen', 'rebellious', 'mistake', 'asking', 'where', 'can', 'get', 'high', 'right', 'front', 'camp', 'counselor', 'who', 'mess-up', 'will', 'send', 'alternative', 'uphill', 'battle', 'Gwen', 'must', 'choose', 'what', ""'feels"", 'good', 'moment', 'live-high-life', 'live-in', 'boyfriend', 'patch', 'up', 'misshapen', 'hole', 'left', 'life', 'find', 'reconciliation', 'sister', 'Lily', 'proclaimed', ""'Sometimes"", 'Gwen', 'make', 'really', 'difficult', 'love', 'choice', ""n't"", 'apparent', 'first', 'soon', 'Gwen', 'forced', 'making', 'decision', 'more', 'time', 'understand', 'help', 'Andrea', 'who', 'secret', 'cutter', 'times', 'torment', 'also', 'pro-ball', 'player', 'who', 'alcohol', 'rehab', 'time', 'coming', 'when', 'Gwen', 'must', 'face', 'sister', 'try', 'desperately', 'patch', 'up', 'broken', 'relationship', 'did', 'screw', 'up', 'sister', 'wedding', ""n't"", 'easy', 'apologize', 'Overall', 'film', 'good', 'heart', 'drugs', 'sex', 'alcohol', 'bad', 'light', 'Unfortunately', 'also', 'are', 'several', 'implied', 'sexual', 'scenes', 'two', 'are', 'seen', 'passing', 'elevator', 'patients', 'man', 'coming', 'half-dressed', 'woman', 'room', 'lots', 'innuendos', 'Andrea', 'soap', 'desperately', 'bad', 'bed-hopping', 'characters', 'only', 'hinted-at', 'dialogue', 'wink', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'unknowing', 'half-siblings', 'When', 'Andrea', 'released', 'rehab', 'Gwen', 'friends', 'do', 'mock', 'parody', 'show', 'hints', 'various', 'discrepancies.There', 'brief', 'rear', 'nudity', 'implications', 'past', 'improprieties', 'immodesty', 'Overlooking', 'sensual', 'current', 'much', 'film', 'also', 'bad', 'language', 'one', 'f-word', 'many', 'mild', 'profanities', 'as', 'well', 'repetitive', 'uses', 'Oh', 'God', 'substance', 'abuse', 'Gwen', 'nearly', 'trying', 'rescue', 'drugs', 'threw', 'out', 'window', 'only', 'hours', 'Boyish', 'jealousy', 'blows', 'are', 'lot', 'flashbacks', 'Gwen', 'remember', 'past', 'childhood', 'alcoholic', 'mother', 'also', 'drug-induced', 'suicide', 'emotional', 'scars', 'many', 'prominent', 'are', 'lot', 'elements', 'good', 'film', 'honestly', 'foot', 'sensuality', 'brief', 'profanity', 'was', 'able', 'look', 'flaws', 'find', 'lessons', 'tucked', 'away', 'film', 'packaging', 'looking', 'fun', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'film', 'Were', 'Sleeping', 'Miss', 'Congeniality', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'laughs', 'are', 'uncomfortable', 'heart-tugging', 'moments', 'reconciliation', 'change', 'very', 'real', 'risk', 'giving', 'ending', 'away', 'end', 'prematurely', 'Gwen', 'choose', 'abandon', 'ties', 'past', 'walk', ""'cleanly"", 'future', '28', 'Days', 'tries', 'very', 'hard', 'be', 'comedy', 'drama', 'up', 'being', 'much', 'more', 'serious', 'comical']",28 Days

Sandra Bullock gives the performance of her career in showing Gwen slowly realizing that she needs help and that, if she only reaches out to those around her (not only her co-rehabs, but her family as well), they will be glad to help her.  We see her trying to hold onto her independence while, at the same time, trying to establish a link with those around her.  This performance is only aided by the great supporting cast.  None of the supporting characters are thoroughly fleshed out, but the actors portraying them give us enough of a glimpse that their presence only makes the film stronger.This is a definite must see drama.

Sandra Bullock proves why she's one of Hollywood's top actresses -- she can act and people like her! She always seems to saturate her performances with sincerity, inviting audiences to relate to her characters, and it's no exception with Gwen. She's convincing and humourous as the alcoholic-in-denial, and we watch her come to terms with her addiction as the film progresses. Azura Skye also turns in a strong and sympathising performance as the drug addict who befriends Gwen. Viggo Mortensen, who was wonderful in A Perfect Murder, turns in a good performance; unfortunately, his character, Eddie, is underdeveloped, and one wonders why he's in the film to begin with.

Her initial indifference to the place and her issue, land her into even more trouble, at which point, she must ultimately decide what she wants out of her own life.A surprisingly emotional and funny picture, which despite its road-much-traveled feel, gives us enough interesting characters and a solid performance from Bullock, to qualify as a solid feel-good dramedy. I don't recommend you see this film if you're expecting to learn something new about the process of rehabilitation, drug or alcohol addiction or the relationships of an addict. But if you don't mind revisiting some of these tendered themes once more in a film which moves at a quick pace, delivers tit-for-tat moments of humor and drama, and ultimately gives you every single 12-step quote needed for anyone to conquer any addiction of life, then grab a couple of six-packs and check yourself into this moving picture. Of course, I've never been shy to admit my own enjoyment of ""the beverage"" every now and again, but thankfully my even bigger fixation on Internet porn, hasn't allowed either habit to take over my life completely. But enough about me. Harumph!Sandra Bullock really surprised me in this film. Sure, her character is still pretty cute, does and says cute things, and knows how to party (well, early on in the movie that is... : ), but this movie allowed Sandra to demonstrate a little more of her dramatic range, a talent which up until this film, had personally gone completely unnoticed by moi. Well by golly, she pulled it off something fierce with several decent scenes featuring a serious Sandra wallowing in her troubles that be. Of course, much like any other ""institutionalized"" movie, the rest of the characters in the film also needed to create a certain amount of interest, if only enough to pad the lead performances. The film delivers on that front as well. The stand-out in the area of humour was definitely the ""german gay guy"" aka Alan Tyduk, who had the crowd in stitches every time he uttered, or tried to utter, a word in this film. Dramatically, Azura Sky took the honors with a touching portrayal of a girl struggling to overcome her disabling disease, and the best hair, as usual, went to the great Viggo Mortensen. I suspect that most fans of Julia Roberts' ERIN BROCKOVICH (7/10) will enjoy this one as well, seeing as both films feature top-dog actresses at the top of their respective game, an interesting yet predictable story, and as per usual Hollywood style, a generally upbeat ending. Of course, this film also has a lot more humor going for it, but I suppose that's offset by the film's many serious moments as well.All in all, you don't have to be a drinker to appreciate this flick, but I suppose an affection for Sandy Bullock, an understanding of the subject at hand, and the capacity to embrace a familiar but entertaining theme, should make this one enjoyable for most anyone fitting that bill.

Nilges ""Author, 'Build Your Own .Ne...","[4, 17]","Hollywood films have long been the locus both of expression of asocial emotions and their discipline, rather than their genuine taming.  This was identified in the case of TV in the 1950s by Theodore Adorno who watched a woman in a &quot;quality&quot; USA program (probably one written for Playhouse Ninety) desire personal liberation, only to realize at the finish that her liberation consisted of...the conventions.  Adorno saw a lack of movement found in Jerry Seinfeld's cynicism about his friends' very ability to have meaningful lives, and this lack of movement exists in 28 Days.28 Days is a disservice to people in recovery from alcohol and drugs.  Because of its deep structure it may itself cause people to relapse.The most amusing part is the first five minutes in which Ms Bullock (an appealing *gamin* with an attractive vulnerability) trashes the wedding of her uptight sister in the company of her drunken boyfriend (apparently an Aussie, Brit or Kiwi who is later punched-out in good old Americano style by a more sober chap.)Like old Three Stooges comedies in which the Republican dowager gets a pie in her face as a protest of real inequality (for in 28 Days, a dowager gets the canapes on her derriere), 28 Days cynically exploits real, if buried anger, against a classist binarism in which one is EITHER a free spirit, but economically disadvantaged, OR a sober resident in an &quot;upscale&quot; community.This is hegemonic for it equates spiritual recovery, and salvation itself, with a nice car and house as trashed by one's daemonic, but salvageable, kid sister.Missing is the very possibility that alcohol and drugs enforce for material reasons (known as &quot;protecting one's supply&quot;) a great deal of highly conventional behavior, and that recovery can involve downward mobility.So attractive is the liberation of the first five minutes that many people in recovery may turn off the new DVD player after Ms Bullock trashes the wedding, go to the nearest bar, put The Clash on the juke-box, and get well and truly wasted.Recovery is not a matter of images but of texts. It is no accident that recovering people talk amongst themselves and read books, rather than watch videos.  As the movie cleverly portrays, the very chemical effect of alcohol, its destruction of short-term memory, causes life to degenerate into freeze frames, at first snapshots of liberation, later on, of horror.Anne Wilson Schaef has called aspects of our society, as replicated by the Hollywood dream factory, addictive, and the best movie about alcoholism (The Lost Weekend) failed at the last minute; for in the novel on which The Lost Weekend was based, the hero does NOT recover, whereas Ray Milland appears to.  28 Days is in the tradition of this dishonesty and in my (layman's) opinion, anybody who watches this film in early recovery is in danger of a slip.  People without addictive tendencies and people with a year of sobriety will be mildly diverted by Sandra's adventures, even in the rather boring recovery home (a home which, it should be noted, is completely unavailable to most addicts and alcoholics.)",1,A disservice to people in recovery!,985996800,"03 31, 2001",2001,3125,"['Hollywood', 'films', 'have', 'long', 'been', 'locus', 'expression', 'asocial', 'emotions', 'discipline', 'rather', 'genuine', 'taming', 'was', 'identified', 'case', 'TV', '1950s', 'Theodore', 'Adorno', 'who', 'watched', 'woman', 'quot', 'quality', 'quot', 'USA', 'program', 'probably', 'one', 'written', 'Playhouse', 'Ninety', 'desire', 'personal', 'liberation', 'only', 'realize', 'finish', 'liberation', 'consisted', 'conventions', 'Adorno', 'saw', 'lack', 'movement', 'found', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'cynicism', 'friends', 'very', 'ability', 'have', 'meaningful', 'lives', 'lack', 'movement', 'exists', '28', 'Days.28', 'Days', 'disservice', 'people', 'recovery', 'alcohol', 'drugs', 'deep', 'structure', 'may', 'cause', 'people', 'relapse.The', 'most', 'amusing', 'part', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'Ms', 'Bullock', 'appealing', '*gamin*', 'attractive', 'vulnerability', 'wedding', 'uptight', 'sister', 'company', 'drunken', 'boyfriend', 'apparently', 'Aussie', 'Brit', 'Kiwi', 'who', 'later', 'punched-out', 'good', 'old', 'Americano', 'style', 'more', 'sober', 'chap', 'old', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'comedies', 'Republican', 'dowager', 'pie', 'face', 'protest', 'real', 'inequality', '28', 'Days', 'dowager', 'canapes', 'derriere', '28', 'Days', 'cynically', 'exploits', 'real', 'buried', 'anger', 'classist', 'binarism', 'one', 'EITHER', 'free', 'spirit', 'economically', 'disadvantaged', 'sober', 'resident', 'quot', 'upscale', 'quot', 'community.This', 'hegemonic', 'spiritual', 'recovery', 'salvation', 'nice', 'car', 'house', 'trashed', 'one', 'daemonic', 'salvageable', 'kid', 'sister.Missing', 'very', 'possibility', 'alcohol', 'drugs', 'enforce', 'material', 'reasons', 'known', 'quot', 'protecting', 'one', 'supply', 'quot', 'great', 'deal', 'highly', 'conventional', 'behavior', 'recovery', 'can', 'involve', 'downward', 'mobility.So', 'attractive', 'liberation', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'many', 'people', 'recovery', 'may', 'turn', 'off', 'new', 'DVD', 'player', 'Ms', 'Bullock', 'wedding', 'go', 'nearest', 'bar', 'put', 'Clash', 'juke-box', 'get', 'well', 'truly', 'wasted.Recovery', 'not', 'matter', 'images', 'texts', 'accident', 'recovering', 'people', 'talk', 'amongst', 'read', 'books', 'rather', 'watch', 'videos', 'movie', 'cleverly', 'portrays', 'very', 'chemical', 'effect', 'alcohol', 'destruction', 'short-term', 'memory', 'life', 'degenerate', 'freeze', 'frames', 'first', 'snapshots', 'liberation', 'later', 'horror.Anne', 'Wilson', 'Schaef', 'called', 'aspects', 'society', 'replicated', 'Hollywood', 'dream', 'factory', 'addictive', 'best', 'movie', 'alcoholism', 'Lost', 'Weekend', 'failed', 'last', 'minute', 'novel', 'Lost', 'Weekend', 'was', 'based', 'hero', 'NOT', 'recover', 'Ray', 'Milland', '28', 'Days', 'tradition', 'dishonesty', 'layman', 'opinion', 'anybody', 'who', 'film', 'early', 'recovery', 'danger', 'slip', 'People', 'addictive', 'tendencies', 'people', 'year', 'sobriety', 'will', 'be', 'mildly', 'diverted', 'Sandra', 'adventures', 'even', 'rather', 'boring', 'recovery', 'home', 'home', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'completely', 'unavailable', 'most', 'addicts', 'alcoholics']",28 Days

552389,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00004UEDQ,"""flickjunkie""","[1, 2]","Sandra Bullock gives an outstanding performance in this story about alcohol and drug rehabilitation.  Unfortunately, the presentation of the story was lacking and it detracted from the film's overall effect.  Director Betty Thomas and writer Suzannah Grant (who scored with the screenplay of &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot;) can't seem to decide whether they want the film to be a zany comedy or a serious drama.  They seem to have been aiming for a bittersweet comedy, but they missed the mark.  They trivialized the good dramatic elements of the story with numerous inane scenes, many of which were more ridiculous than funny.  The film also suffers from an excess of clich&eacute;s, some overemphasized to the point of being moronic.  It is difficult to take much of the story seriously with all the foolishness that is continually erupting.  The result of this directorial miscalculation was that the film was hammered at the box office, with the gross ticket sales failing even to match production costs.  That's a pity because a lot of people missed an excellent dramatic performance.Sandra Bullock was a ray of sunshine that burst forth from this otherwise jumbled mess.  Sandra simply out-acted and outclassed the entire cast and did a terrific job despite the ""nutty institution"" approach.  This is something of a departure from her accustomed romantic comedy roles.  She had a chance to flex her dramatic acting muscles here, portraying a very confused and distraught character.  She went from the highest of highs to the lowest of lows and handled the full range of emotions beautifully.  It was one of the most complete dramatic performances I have seen from her to date.I rated this film a 6/10 on the strength of Bullock's portrayal.  Without her, it would have been about a 3/10.  If the topic had been treated more seriously, with sensitivity to the nuances of drug rehabilitation rather than having a good laugh at their expense, it would have been far more powerful and effective.",3,"Sandra's great, the movie isn't",971654400,"10 16, 2000",2000,1994,"['Sandra', 'Bullock', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'story', 'alcohol', 'drug', 'rehabilitation', 'Unfortunately', 'presentation', 'story', 'was', 'lacking', 'detracted', 'film', 'overall', 'effect', 'Director', 'Betty', 'Thomas', 'writer', 'Suzannah', 'Grant', 'who', 'scored', 'screenplay', 'quot', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'quot', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'decide', 'want', 'film', 'be', 'zany', 'comedy', 'serious', 'drama', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'aiming', 'bittersweet', 'comedy', 'missed', 'mark', 'trivialized', 'good', 'dramatic', 'elements', 'story', 'numerous', 'inane', 'scenes', 'many', 'were', 'more', 'ridiculous', 'funny', 'film', 'also', 'excess', 'clich', 'eacute', 'overemphasized', 'point', 'being', 'moronic', 'difficult', 'take', 'much', 'story', 'seriously', 'foolishness', 'continually', 'erupting', 'result', 'directorial', 'miscalculation', 'was', 'film', 'was', 'hammered', 'box', 'office', 'gross', 'ticket', 'sales', 'failing', 'even', 'match', 'production', 'costs', 'pity', 'lot', 'people', 'missed', 'excellent', 'dramatic', 'performance.Sandra', 'Bullock', 'was', 'ray', 'sunshine', 'burst', 'forth', 'otherwise', 'jumbled', 'mess', 'Sandra', 'simply', 'out-acted', 'outclassed', 'entire', 'cast', 'did', 'terrific', 'job', 'nutty', 'institution', 'approach', 'something', 'departure', 'accustomed', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'roles', 'had', 'chance', 'flex', 'dramatic', 'acting', 'muscles', 'here', 'portraying', 'very', 'confused', 'distraught', 'character', 'went', 'highest', 'highs', 'lowest', 'lows', 'handled', 'full', 'range', 'emotions', 'beautifully', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'complete', 'dramatic', 'performances', 'have', 'seen', 'date.I', 'rated', 'film', '6/10', 'strength', 'Bullock', 'portrayal', 'would', 'have', 'been', '3/10', 'topic', 'had', 'been', 'treated', 'more', 'seriously', 'sensitivity', 'nuances', 'drug', 'rehabilitation', 'rather', 'having', 'good', 'laugh', 'expense', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'more', 'powerful', 'effective']",28 Days

552397,A113EXY3MASTGG,B00004UEDQ,John Schinter,"[2, 2]","28 Days is a fabulous movie that stirs many emotions associated with addiction, immaturity, and insecurity. Sandra Bullock plays a character that demonstrates how many perceived strong and ""vibrant"" people in our lives, are too often driven by hidden insecurities and emotional pain. The movie centers around a beautiful and charismatic woman about 30 years old, that has surrounded her life with equally colorful and insecure people that routinely gather and celebrate in public places, all attempting to demonstrate that they are part of the ""in-crowd"". Although these people can be perceived to be having the time of their lives, it turns out they really have no life at all - and do a great job of indirectly hurting themselves and their family. Addiction to alcohol and drugs is a common outcome, and I am guessing that we all may know people like this.The movie makes you laugh and cry, and really makes you think about those people in your lives that may mask an internal pain, with external friendliness or happiness - maybe even ourselves.

Speed 2: Cruise Control and Forces With Nature were both serious flops with critics around the globe, and she hasn't been very well respected for a long time. But, this will be the film that puts her on track. 28 Days is a well-made and thought-provoking film that is much better than it looks, and it deserves a wide audience.Gwen Cummings (Sandra Bullock) is a New York writer who just can't say no to drink or drugs. After crashing her sister's wedding car and ruining her wedding cake, Gwen is ordered into a rehabilitation centre, where she spends the next 28 days. At first she doesn't have much respect for the centre and tries to escape, but as her toxic levels come down, she gradually realises that maybe she can turn her life around.The plot may sound lousy, but it isn't. It deals with human emotions properly and in a moving way, and 28 Days is able to put a smile on your lips and make tears come out of your eyes. Bullock is a stunner in this film, she is perfectly cast as Gwen, while Steve Buscemi is as brilliant as he always is, no doubt about that. Azura Skye, who co-stars as a friend of Gwen's, lights up the screen in an ignored performance which deserves praise. Susannah Grant, scriptwriter, seems to have a thing for making good actresses come back to their great standards. In the same year of release as 28 Days, Grant wrote Erin Brockovich, a brilliant legal drama that made Julia Robert's get the career-best nod. Now she can fix Sandra Bullock, and this could very well be Bullock's best film.It has it's problems, some major ones, but 28 Days remains a worthy watch for all ages.",4,Much better than I thought it would be.

Bullock allows Gwen to go through all of the stages of denial, regret and final acceptance of her disease with comedic touches and true pain showing both sides of addiction recovery as they are: the blunt reality that you have hit bottom and you may die, but on the other hand ""Keep it simple stupid"" and ""Easy does it.One day at a time."" In other hands, this movie about such a serious and life threatening condition might become overly serious,preachy or maudlin; but director Betty Thomas trusts Bullock with the Susannah Grant screenplay to keep Gwen from becoming a joke OR a model of sobriety.If I had to choose one film that treats addiction without depressing the viewer to no end, then it would be 28 DAYS. Other excellent films such as MY NAME IS JOE, CLEAN AND SOBER, FACTORY GIRL,RAY, AFFLICTION and even NUTS, although completely wonderful films in their own rights, are very heavy handed and can be quite depressing. 28 DAYS embraces the grave subject with a lighter touch that does not bring down the viewer.(REMEMBER: Movies can inform and STILL be entertaining!)

It is a light Hollywood treatment of a serious topic. You can take the point of view that at least maybe people who ARE addicted will see it without realizing the full import up front, and realize they need help.We begin with Sandra Bullock's character, who is a New York lady living the high life with her boyfriend. After a night of heavy drinking, she wakes up late for her older sister's wedding. She completely destroys the wedding, crashes the wedding limo and ends up in rehab.You get the typical transition from surly, angry newcomer to understanding, coping recovery person - learning more about her past and the characters around her along the way. Situations are extremely two dimensional and oversimplified, but to be fair, the movie only has so many minutes in which to tell the story. There are the traditional set-backs and problems, and small victories.So where is Viggo, the 2nd billing, in all of this? If you're a Viggo fan, you spend about half the movie waiting for him. He eventually shows up as a baseball pitcher tossed into rehab to fix his drugs-and-girls habit. He's got southern charm and a laid back personality, as always. And yes, there are horses. It seems Viggo likes to be in horse-movies. In this case, the horse is one of the key ""characters"" - it symbolizes Sandra's ability to finally let things go and trust in life.It's actually suprising that Viggo got second billing here. He doesn't have many lines, and he isn't even a 'romantic partner' for Sandra. In fact he is quite innocent when Sandra's boyfriend accuses Viggo of stepping into the situation.  Viggo does deliver the final message to her as she leaves rehab, though - to learn how to forgive, and to cut her boyfriend loose in order to face a new world alcohol-free. Sure enough, it turns out her boyfriend is trying to drag her right into the same world, and she does better to go it alone.The scenes with Viggo were a little contrived, but they had their own charm. Viggo had his low key country charm, but punched Sandra's boyfriend pretty quickly when things got rough. He showed Sandra how to pitch, and had her throw the ball with her eyes closed, to teach her trust. On the other hand, he was literally caught with his pants down, showing that he hadn't quite given up the sleeping around yet.The only thing missing here in the ""Viggo Standards"" was another language - Viggo only gets to speak ""southern American"" in this film!Interestingly, this was Viggo's last movie before the Lord of the Rings series.

552413,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00004UEDQ,Matthew Horner,"[21, 25]","The previews, at least the theatrical ones, for 28 Days are misleading. They put the emphasis on its comedic moments. The movie is actually a drama, a cautionary tale about the toll substance abuse has on one young woman. Because the character is rescued before she hits bottom or does anything she will forever regret, the humor has its place here.Sandra Bullock is Gwen Cummings, a writer who loves to party. She lives with an Englishman named Jasper [Dominic West], who makes the perfect playmate. They drink, they go out to dinner, they drink some more, they go dancing, they go home and drink even more. When they can remember, they pop a few pills to make things even merrier. One night they light some candles to enhance a lovemaking session. In the process they nearly burn their apartment down. Things come to a head when they arrive late and higher than kites at her older sister's wedding. Gwen ruins the special day, then commandeers a limo, wrecks it and winds up in jail. The judge gives her a suspended sentence but orders her to go to a rehab center. Typical of an addict, Gwen minimizes the extent of her problem. She does not think she needs to be in the center because she believes she can give up her habit on her own. She is in for some surprises, not all of them pleasant.I will admit that Ms. Bullock is not one of my favorite actresses. She's fairly lightweight. I've also never seen much chemistry between her and her costars when she's chosen to do romantic roles. She has her good points. Off screen, she is a great businessperson. In a movie like 28 Days, she is not afraid to be seen looking unglamorous, and this does lend credibility to her performance. She is also wise enough not to try to dominate a picture.There are two fine supporting actresses. Elizabeth Perkins is convincing as Gwen's sister, who has spent a lifetime rescuing Gwen and is sick of it. Azura Skye is touching as Gwen's young roommate, Andrea, whose problems are quite serious.The depiction of a rehab center here is a very Hollywood vision. Most of the patients are stereotypes of what addicts are like. Still, 28 Days is a likable movie, and it does provide a message. For more accurate portrayals of drug and alcohol addiction, I would recommend Postcards From the Edge and Girl, Interrupted. Two of the finest films on the subject are much older - The Lost Weekend [1948] and The Days of Wine and Roses [1962].",3,Okay look at drug and alcohol addiction,1016409600,"03 18, 2002",2002,2418,"['previews', 'least', 'theatrical', 'ones', '28', 'Days', 'are', 'misleading', 'put', 'emphasis', 'comedic', 'moments', 'movie', 'actually', 'drama', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'toll', 'substance', 'abuse', 'one', 'young', 'woman', 'character', 'rescued', 'bottom', 'anything', 'will', 'forever', 'regret', 'humor', 'place', 'here.Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Gwen', 'Cummings', 'writer', 'who', 'party', 'Englishman', 'named', 'Jasper', '[', 'Dominic', 'West', ']', 'who', 'perfect', 'playmate', 'drink', 'go', 'out', 'dinner', 'drink', 'more', 'go', 'dancing', 'go', 'home', 'drink', 'even', 'more', 'When', 'can', 'remember', 'pop', 'few', 'pills', 'make', 'things', 'even', 'merrier', 'One', 'night', 'light', 'candles', 'enhance', 'lovemaking', 'session', 'process', 'nearly', 'burn', 'apartment', 'down', 'Things', 'come', 'head', 'when', 'arrive', 'late', 'higher', 'kites', 'older', 'sister', 'wedding', 'Gwen', 'special', 'day', 'then', 'limo', 'up', 'jail', 'judge', 'suspended', 'sentence', 'orders', 'go', 'rehab', 'center', 'Typical', 'addict', 'Gwen', 'extent', 'problem', 'not', 'think', 'be', 'center', 'can', 'give', 'up', 'habit', 'own', 'surprises', 'not', 'pleasant.I', 'will', 'admit', 'Ms.', 'Bullock', 'not', 'one', 'favorite', 'actresses', 'fairly', 'lightweight', ""'ve"", 'also', 'never', 'seen', 'much', 'chemistry', 'costars', 'when', 'chosen', 'do', 'romantic', 'roles', 'good', 'points', 'Off', 'screen', 'great', 'businessperson', 'movie', '28', 'Days', 'not', 'afraid', 'be', 'seen', 'looking', 'unglamorous', 'lend', 'credibility', 'performance', 'also', 'wise', 'enough', 'not', 'try', 'dominate', 'picture.There', 'are', 'two', 'fine', 'supporting', 'actresses', 'Elizabeth', 'Perkins', 'convincing', 'Gwen', 'sister', 'who', 'spent', 'lifetime', 'rescuing', 'Gwen', 'sick', 'Azura', 'Skye', 'touching', 'Gwen', 'young', 'roommate', 'Andrea', 'problems', 'are', 'quite', 'serious.The', 'depiction', 'rehab', 'center', 'here', 'very', 'Hollywood', 'vision', 'Most', 'patients', 'are', 'stereotypes', 'what', 'addicts', 'are', 'Still', '28', 'Days', 'likable', 'movie', 'provide', 'message', 'more', 'accurate', 'portrayals', 'drug', 'alcohol', 'addiction', 'would', 'recommend', 'Postcards', 'Edge', 'Girl', 'Interrupted', 'Two', 'finest', 'films', 'subject', 'are', 'much', 'older', 'Lost', 'Weekend', '[', '1948', ']', 'Days', 'Wine', 'Roses', '[', '1962', ']']",28 Days

This is the story of a woman (&quot;Gwen&quot;) driven to alcoholism and then drug addiction because of her unstable childhood with a mother who died early from the same addictions, a father who was never there, and a perfect and overacheiving sister she could never live up to.  To avoid going to jail, &quot;Gwen&quot;, as Sandra's character in the movie is called, has to spend 28 days at a rehabilitation clinic.  I only gave this movie four stars because certain aspects of it became annoying to me: the overdramatic depiction of the cheesy rehabiliation clinic and the residents there, the plot's fascination with a fictional soap opera, Santa Cruz, and an underdeveloped and quite irrelevant subplot of a mini-relationship forming between Gwen and a famous baseball player at the clinic.  However, the rest of the movie was great.  The plot, which one would expect to be hackneyed because of all the movies and books dealing with the subjects of alcoholism, drug addiction, and recovery, is pretty fast-paced and fresh.  Sandra acts the part very well, and the struggle of recovery is portrayed fairly well also.  I found myself rooting for the characters to beat the odds and finally kick their addictions, and of course for Sandra to turn out all right as well.  The subject of this film is a dreary one, but there are humourous parts injected at just the right times to keep it from becoming too heavy and depressing.

Sandra Bullock and Viggo Mortensen  are terrific but the film can be unrealistic regarding drugs and alcohol and becoming clean in 28 days. It follows the AA model and clearly a ""white"" addiction and fails to address the revolving door that any addiction can resume and lacks the prostitution aspect. However, the film displays usual facets of addiction recovery which can be relationship development, sabotage and a lack of the impact with family system development by only blaming the addict, and not addressing the vital forces of trauma, mental illness and co-dependency with addiction.",4,The Revolving Door?,1323993600,"12 16, 2011",2011,670,"['like', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'cleaner', 'version', 'drug', 'alcohol', 'addiction', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'are', 'terrific', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'unrealistic', 'regarding', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'becoming', 'clean', '28', 'days', 'AA', 'model', 'clearly', 'white', 'addiction', 'address', 'revolving', 'door', 'addiction', 'can', 'resume', 'prostitution', 'aspect', 'However', 'film', 'displays', 'usual', 'facets', 'addiction', 'recovery', 'can', 'be', 'relationship', 'development', 'sabotage', 'lack', 'impact', 'family', 'system', 'development', 'only', 'blaming', 'addict', 'not', 'addressing', 'vital', 'forces', 'trauma', 'mental', 'illness', 'co-dependency', 'addiction']",28 Days
552426,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00004UEDQ,Roland E. Zwick,"[4, 9]","**1/2  There comes a time in the career of every performer identified mainly with lightweight romantic comedy roles to take the plunge into more serious acting challenges - in the hopes that we will see beyond his or her pretty face and into the heart of the great actor that resides within.  And strangely enough, many of these actors and actresses choose the same exact route to accomplish this feat - that of portraying a person heavily addicted to drugs and/or alcohol.  This was the case with, for instance, Meg Ryan in ""When a Man Loves a Woman"" and Michael J. Fox in ""Bright Lights, Big City"" to name just a few.  Now we have Sandra Bullock attempting to stretch her thespian muscles by portraying an alcoholic in ""28 Days,"" the tale of a young woman's experiences in a detox center located in a bucolic suburb of New York City.One of the initial problems with such films is that casting such well-known faces in these parts automatically ends up conferring a bit too much glamour on the situation.  And ""28 Days"" is no exception.  It's hard to accept Bullock as a particularly credible person in this role.  Still, the movie is generally watchable because it manages to make the people and the rituals at the center seem both utterly addled and emotionally endearing all at the same time.  When Bullock - feisty, close-minded, smug in her sense of superiority - first arrives after being ordered to the center as a part of her probation, we are as appalled as she is by the touch-feely nature of what is going on there.  If anything could keep one from becoming an addict, the threat of being sent to a place like this would just about do it.  But then, as the various characters begin to open up and reveal themselves as true hurting individuals, we, like the Bullock character, begin to be won over.  But even these people aren't given enough screen time to really grow into fully-rounded, complex characters in their own right.The film never entirely breaks out of its TV-movie formula.  We are treated to all the standard plot devices common to the genre:  the inevitable overdose by one of the patients, romantic interludes with a professional baseball player, the clashes between the latter and Bullock's troublemaking boyfriend.  One of the problems with glossy studies of addiction such as this one is that, more often than not, we are led to believe that the ""cure"" is a permanent one - not necessarily because the film shows us that (in fact, it makes a few nods in the direction of showing that it ISN'T always permanent) but because the two-hour time frame and the audience demand for a hopeful, upbeat ending inadvertently leave us with that impression.  To be fair to the film, it doesn't tie up all the loose ends into a nice pretty package.  We are given cause for hope, but the open-ended nature of the final scenes suggests properly that the struggle will go on.""28 Days"" is a film with its heart in the right place.  In fact our own hearts go out to it, to Ms. Bullock, to all those involved in its making.  We realize that it is difficult to make a film that, on the one hand, yearns to be an uncompromising study of a subject as gritty as this one, yet, on the other, feels the need to appeal to as wide a mass audience as possible.  The result, unfortunately, is a film that is too lightweight to be taken seriously, too ""entertaining"" to be real.",2,overly slick but occasionally enjoyable,991008000,"05 28, 2001",2001,3377,"['**1/2', 'time', 'career', 'performer', 'identified', 'mainly', 'lightweight', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'roles', 'take', 'plunge', 'more', 'serious', 'acting', 'challenges', 'hopes', 'will', 'see', 'pretty', 'face', 'heart', 'great', 'actor', 'strangely', 'enough', 'many', 'actors', 'actresses', 'choose', 'same', 'exact', 'route', 'accomplish', 'feat', 'portraying', 'person', 'heavily', 'addicted', 'drugs', 'and/or', 'alcohol', 'was', 'case', 'instance', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'When', 'Man', 'Woman', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'Bright', 'Lights', 'Big', 'City', 'name', 'just', 'few', 'Now', 'have', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'attempting', 'stretch', 'thespian', 'muscles', 'portraying', 'alcoholic', '28', 'Days', 'tale', 'young', 'woman', 'experiences', 'detox', 'center', 'located', 'bucolic', 'suburb', 'New', 'York', 'City.One', 'initial', 'problems', 'such', 'films', 'casting', 'such', 'well-known', 'parts', 'automatically', 'up', 'conferring', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'glamour', 'situation', '28', 'Days', 'exception', 'hard', 'accept', 'Bullock', 'particularly', 'credible', 'person', 'role', 'Still', 'movie', 'generally', 'watchable', 'make', 'people', 'rituals', 'center', 'seem', 'utterly', 'addled', 'emotionally', 'endearing', 'same', 'time', 'When', 'Bullock', 'feisty', 'close-minded', 'smug', 'sense', 'superiority', 'first', 'arrives', 'being', 'ordered', 'center', 'part', 'probation', 'are', 'as', 'appalled', 'touch-feely', 'nature', 'what', 'going', 'there', 'anything', 'could', 'keep', 'one', 'becoming', 'addict', 'threat', 'being', 'sent', 'place', 'would', 'just', 'about', 'do', 'then', 'various', 'characters', 'begin', 'open', 'up', 'reveal', 'true', 'hurting', 'individuals', 'Bullock', 'character', 'begin', 'be', 'won', 'even', 'people', 'are', ""n't"", 'given', 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'really', 'grow', 'fully-rounded', 'complex', 'characters', 'own', 'right.The', 'film', 'never', 'entirely', 'TV-movie', 'formula', 'are', 'treated', 'standard', 'plot', 'devices', 'common', 'genre', 'inevitable', 'overdose', 'one', 'patients', 'romantic', 'interludes', 'professional', 'baseball', 'player', 'clashes', 'latter', 'Bullock', 'troublemaking', 'boyfriend', 'One', 'problems', 'glossy', 'studies', 'addiction', 'such', 'one', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'are', 'led', 'believe', 'cure', 'permanent', 'one', 'not', 'necessarily', 'film', 'fact', 'few', 'nods', 'direction', 'showing', ""N'T"", 'always', 'permanent', 'two-hour', 'time', 'frame', 'audience', 'demand', 'hopeful', 'upbeat', 'ending', 'inadvertently', 'leave', 'impression', 'be', 'fair', 'film', ""n't"", 'tie', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'nice', 'pretty', 'package', 'are', 'given', 'cause', 'hope', 'open-ended', 'nature', 'final', 'scenes', 'properly', 'struggle', 'will', 'go', '28', 'Days', 'film', 'heart', 'right', 'place', 'fact', 'own', 'hearts', 'go', 'out', 'Ms.', 'Bullock', 'involved', 'making', 'realize', 'difficult', 'make', 'film', 'one', 'hand', 'yearns', 'be', 'uncompromising', 'study', 'subject', 'as', 'gritty', 'one', 'yet', 'other', 'need', 'appeal', 'wide', 'mass', 'audience', 'possible', 'result', 'unfortunately', 'film', 'too', 'lightweight', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'too', 'entertaining', 'be', 'real']",28 Days
552427,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B00004UEDQ,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[3, 4]","I didn't want to see &quot;28 Days&quot; in which Sandra Bullock plays a writer with a pill and booze problem sentenced to rehab.  Much of the film - in which Bullock is the only really recognizable face - seems to be what I expected, but I enjoyed it despite myself.  Surviving what could have been a fatal DWI accident, Gwen is sentenced to Rehab in some upstate facility that seems pretty nice to anybody not in immediate need of chemical stimulation.  Cigarettes are about the closest items of sin permitted, and even they're subject to war-time rations.The directors keep the focus on Gwen, Sandra's charachter, but they compensate by restraining the urge to reduce her fellow patients into one-note charachters good only for comic relief.  Some of the best charachters seem both funny and sad at the same time.  Gwen's need for perpetual stimulation stem, not suprisingly, from her mother, a manic alcoholic in her own day.  Flashback scenes in which a younger Gwen and Mom sled down snowy hills would seem hysterical, that is until the moment we see the oncoming cars.Gwen's and her friends' addictions come in all different categories - though most seem to share shameless addictions to simple things like &quot;Santa Cruz&quot;, a vile soap opera, fatalism and a brooding unwillingness to admit their problems.  The challenge of the story is getting past the obvious addictions to the ones that really make these charachters weaker people but stronger charachters.  For Gwen, the addiction is to anything that keeps the world from slowing down enough to reveal its bleakness.  When Gwen's mother took a break from the party, she could be found napping on the kitchen floor, dreaming of a liver that worked.  Robbed of her pills and her beer, Gwen handles the slowdown of withdrawl badly.  Breaking her leg, Gwen wakes in the Clinic's infirmary, looking at her own reflection as if it were a stranger's - she looks ugly!  If they could hand out Oscar's for the best split second of self-realization, Bullock would win for that moment alone.",3,Good star turn by Sandra Bullock,979603200,"01 16, 2001",2001,2048,"['did', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'quot', '28', 'Days', 'quot', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'writer', 'pill', 'booze', 'problem', 'sentenced', 'rehab', 'Much', 'film', 'Bullock', 'only', 'really', 'recognizable', 'face', 'be', 'what', 'expected', 'enjoyed', 'Surviving', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'fatal', 'DWI', 'accident', 'Gwen', 'sentenced', 'Rehab', 'upstate', 'facility', 'pretty', 'nice', 'anybody', 'not', 'immediate', 'need', 'chemical', 'stimulation', 'Cigarettes', 'are', 'closest', 'items', 'sin', 'permitted', 'even', ""'re"", 'subject', 'war-time', 'rations.The', 'directors', 'keep', 'focus', 'Gwen', 'Sandra', 'charachter', 'compensate', 'restraining', 'urge', 'reduce', 'fellow', 'patients', 'one-note', 'charachters', 'good', 'only', 'comic', 'relief', 'best', 'charachters', 'seem', 'funny', 'sad', 'same', 'time', 'Gwen', 'need', 'perpetual', 'stimulation', 'stem', 'not', 'suprisingly', 'mother', 'manic', 'alcoholic', 'own', 'day', 'Flashback', 'scenes', 'younger', 'Gwen', 'Mom', 'sled', 'down', 'snowy', 'hills', 'would', 'seem', 'hysterical', 'moment', 'see', 'oncoming', 'cars.Gwen', 'friends', 'addictions', 'come', 'different', 'categories', 'most', 'seem', 'share', 'shameless', 'addictions', 'simple', 'things', 'quot', 'Santa', 'Cruz', 'quot', 'vile', 'soap', 'opera', 'fatalism', 'brooding', 'unwillingness', 'admit', 'problems', 'challenge', 'story', 'getting', 'obvious', 'addictions', 'ones', 'really', 'make', 'charachters', 'weaker', 'people', 'stronger', 'charachters', 'Gwen', 'addiction', 'anything', 'world', 'slowing', 'down', 'enough', 'reveal', 'bleakness', 'When', 'Gwen', 'mother', 'took', 'break', 'party', 'could', 'be', 'found', 'napping', 'kitchen', 'floor', 'dreaming', 'liver', 'worked', 'Robbed', 'pills', 'beer', 'Gwen', 'slowdown', 'withdrawl', 'badly', 'Breaking', 'leg', 'Gwen', 'Clinic', 'infirmary', 'looking', 'own', 'reflection', 'were', 'stranger', 'ugly', 'could', 'hand', 'out', 'Oscar', 'best', 'split', 'second', 'self-realization', 'Bullock', 'would', 'win', 'moment', 'alone']",28 Days

Writer Susannah Grant, director Betty Thomas, and cast researched their ensemble comedy by living in rehabilitation facilities. Ubiquitous Guitar Man Loudon Wainwright III plays and sings emotionally pertinent lyrics while standing behind the action as a Greek chorus [ASIN:6305291470 Mighty Aphrodite] Woody Allen. In the forefront is the fake soap opera Santa Cruz (commentary on popular culture available in its entirety on this disc in Special Features) addictively watched by the entire rehab community of the movie.Makeupless Diane Ladd portrays self denigrating, humiliated wife of an emotionally abusive philanderer. Marianne Jean-Baptiste as Roshanda hides her British accent, delivers a druggie's aggressive front, until during family therapy her young daughter and son tell her how her addictive behavior affects them. This scene is reminiscent of Jess the child in When a Man Loves a Woman who explains to her father Michael (Andy Garcia) ""you are supposed to hold the bottle in a paper bag to drink"" describing her mother Alice (Meg Ryan),Saving Mr. BanksTom Hanks Emma Thompson story about Mary Poppins,August: Osage CountyMeryl Streep Julia Roberts Sam Shepherd.In 28 Days Sandra Bullock's character has flashbacks of her alcoholic mother, exciting, entertaining, frightening, amnestic, behavior similar to her own character Gwen Cummings a journalist partying with boyfriend Jasper (Dominic West) borrowing money from her sister played by Elizabeth Perkins, until she destroys her sister's wedding with drunken disregard for the feelings of everyone. Judge offers choice of jail or rehab. Gwen chooses rehab until she decides continued partying with Jasper is more fun. When she is confronted with the jail alternative which she has chosen, Bullock's Gwen is able to lie ""I can quit, I don't have a problem, I can't go to jail"" until she can't. Steve Buscemi is stellar as Gwen's drug counselor Cornell, willing to narrate his own life violations of other's rights as we watch Gwen vainly trying to retrieve a bottle of prescription painkillers she had discarded.Azura Skye plays a 17 year old heroin addict Andrea, Gwen's roommate, who uses chocolate and self cutting as dysfunctional coping skills. The addiction drives continued use with statistical consequences. Gwen teaches her roomie to fold a chewing gum paper wrapper chain to keep her hands busy instead of self mutilation. The disc has instructions on how to make the chewing gum paper chain. Gwen and Andrea clearly depict the tremor of addicts in remission.Alan Tudyk is hilarious throughout. Especially in the Santa Cruz parody which the residents devise as a going away theatrical for Andrea. The emotional pain of leaving rehabilitation, with its safety, literature, lectures, 24/7 activities, monitoring, security and social support is well portrayed. What isn't seen is the financial burden of residential treatment.Various forms of therapy are seen: equine therapy (use of horses to detect intention), climbing therapy (trust of others), group therapy (confrontation by others who are just like you), family therapy (pain), restricted access to mind altering chemicals (caffeine), outdoor therapy. And the shame and stigma associated with trying to get help: baseball player Eddie Boone (Viggo Mortensen) is approached by adoring young fans for his autograph. When Eddie tries to get an autograph from his idol Falcon (see this denouement after the final credits are complete at the end of the DVD) he is again humiliated.Trying to act against the permanent neurobehavioral alterations in the brain caused by compulsive behaviors and brain cell killing chemicals, is a moment to moment struggle well filmed in this bucolic North Carolina setting.The repeated relapses from rehabilitation are seen through the eyes of the residents, as well as returning patients.The movie is laugh out loud funny, which makes watching easier since the subject matter is so intense. Stopping use is only the beginning of the work of change. Gwen realizes she has only taken a first step on the road of life, which everyone has to walk. The yellow brick road to a rescuer Wizard is an illusion which only circles back around to the self, again and again, as the person who has to do the work remains inside. Ruby Slippers notwithstanding.It isn't all about other people, its about us, all of us, with bad breath, smelly feet, underarm odor and all the other frailties of human existence. When we are finally able to see us as a unit, we begin to heal. The gifts and talents offered and received are the same: listening, insight, honesty, candor, asking for help.

She plays a alcoholic, who needs to find herself again in rehab, that is why the name &quot;28 days&quot;. Why is this movie so good? Well, it shows you how the  real world can be, and that it isn't always much fun as it looks. My  favourite part of the movie is where Gwen (Sandra) plays a part of the hot  series &quot;Santa Cruz&quot;. She has these curly things in her hair, and  plays a magic role as Dorian. She does this for her roommate, who is almost  leaving rehab. Of course there are more funny bits in the movie, but also  serious parts.

552433,A2PN7Z2VTHICL8,B00004UEDQ,"Schtinky ""Schtinky""","[49, 51]","Maybe you are thinking what I was thinking when I first heard about this movie.  ""Oh great, they are making a cute movie out of a horrible problem called addiction, and are going to sum up rehab in a darling, romanticized way.""  I refused to watch it for a long time because of this presumption.  Relax, and give the film a try.  Although cute in places and using some subtle but great humor, '28 Days' does not romanticize the problem of addiction.What it does manage to show, much to my amazement, is how trite and cheesy 'Recovery' can seem to the addict.  The scenes of chanting, serenity prayers, and singing 'Lean On Me' are not portrayed as inspiring or moving, but as irritating customs of the Center.  Perhaps portions of the movie go to the far edges of each condition, drunkenness and sobriety, but it does not come across as contrived.  People really do these things, and some people really recover from it, and '28 Days' follows Gwen Cummings story, who is an exceptionally ""gravitational"" personality, easily allowing for a larger than life story.Gwen (Sandra Bullock) is a writer, and along with party-time boyfriend Jasper (Dominic West) show up late and manage to ruin her sister Lily's (Elizabeth Perkins) wedding.  After being late, Gwen ruins the mother-in-law's dress, takes a spin on the dance floor and winds out crushing the wedding cake, then steals a limo to drive to a cake store and replace it.  Careening down the road, Gwen wrecks the limo into the side of a house.  Sentenced to twenty-eight days in rehab or prison, Gwen finds herself at the Serenity Glen Rehabilitation Center.Gwen's lifestyle as a New York writer/columnist is not conductive to sobriety, but even Gwen never realized the extent of her reliance on booze and prescription drugs.  Not until she breaks the rules of Serenity Glen and her counselor Cornell (played by the amazing Steve Buscemi) arranges to have her sentence continued in prison.  Only when Gwen practically leaps from a third story window in an attempt to retrieve the pills from Jasper that she earlier threw away does Gwen realize something is wrong with her.  She decides its time to do something for herself, and convinces Cornell to let her stay at Serenity Glen.Gwen must face many aspects of herself that she finds intolerable while sober, while also facing visits from Jasper who doesn't see the point of leaving their old life behind for sobriety.  What follows is a touching, and yes, comical romp through Gwen's rehab, but it fits well because Gwen has a tendency to use humor to deflect emotional response.The characters in this movie are outstanding.  Sandra Bullock plays Gwen to perfection.  Steve Buscemi is amazing as always, Dominic West as fun-boy Jasper is perfect, and look for a ridiculously intriguing performance by Alan Tudyk as Gerhardt, the funniest character in the movie.  Gerhardt is an eccentric, over-the-top, emotional, stammering geek, and steals the movie with only a few lines.  (""Oh my God, look at my package!"" and ""I want my foreskin back, no one asked when they took it, they just took it."")  Also, at the very end of the movie, check out Gerhardt's T-shirt that he's wearing.  Hysterical!!Even through the horrid cheesiness of ridiculous rehab ritual, Gwen manages to make friends.  Aside from Gerhardt, there is Daniel (Reni Santoni) the doctor who used to pump his own stomach, Andrea (Azura Skye), Gwen's roommate, a seventeen year old heroin addict who is far wiser than her years, Betty (Margo Martindale) as the crotchety but not humorless receptionist, and Eddie Boone (Viggo Mortenson) a professional baseball player addicted to booze and sex.I was surprised at how well this movie actually turned out, comparing in my opinion to the classics 'Days Of Wine And Roses' and 'Lost Weekend'.  Pay special attention to Cornell's speech for the group, where he talks about using whether something happened or nothing happened.  While there is good humor in this movie, and it realistically portrays the cheesiness of all those rehab clich&eacute;s, it still winds out to be a good (though somewhat tragic) story about a good person.  Gwen is obviously a loveable personality, both drunk and sober, which makes her choice more realistic than someone who makes a ""dramatic change"".  There is a very funny scene where Gwen uses her talents as a writer to create an impromptu play based on Andrea's favorite soap opera, Santa Cruz.  The clips of this soap opera are so over the top that you will laugh your hinder off at them.Great acting, fantastic characterizations, good photography, a healthy dose of realism, a great script, and insightfully surreal flashbacks made this movie much better than it should have been.  Oh, and it made me thirsty (he  he he).  Definitely a 'buy', but I always recommend rent first.

The story focuses on Gwen (Sandra Bullock) an alcoholic journalist who wrecks a limousine at her sisters wedding and is sentenced to 28 days in a rehab center where she meets a wide variety of people. One might ask themselves, where is the fun in that? However in the hands of director Betty Thomas (Dr. Dolittle) a wonderful quirky comedy/drama is created. When people are uncomfortable and vulnerable it is a human tendency to deflect those feelings with humor. That is what we see here, a wide variety of people who need help with a multitude of problems. Each person uses humor in a different way to cope with what is going on in his or her lives. However, Thomas is careful not to go overboard, and she adds plenty of emotional scenes to balance out the movie. This is after all about rehab and the seriousness of addiction, and Thomas never trivializes the subject. In fact she, along with most of the cast, spent time at an actual rehab center in order to portray the experience as accurately as possible. By walking that fine line between comedy and drama, Thomas has created a group of people that you genuinely care about without pitying.

This movie does have the virtue of being genuinely funny in some places.  Best of all  this movie does not take itself so seriously that the anti-drug message dominates the movie.  The Movie has a strong anti-drug message make no mistake about that but it is not preachy, high toned, condescending or overly moralistic.I do not agree that this movie protrays all teenaged ladies as vapid, self absorbed, trite peices of fluff unable to avoid the snare of drug abuse or addiction.  However if you go to a football stadium during a football game most of the people you will see there are football fans.  Likewise if you have a movie set in the teen ladies unit of a drug treatment center you will see mostly teenaged ladies who for whatever reason were unable to beat the lure of low life dope dealers.  The fact that a small faction of teen aged young ladies end up on the crazy road to drug drained boozed up palookaville does not in any way take from the fact that most teen aged young ladies become awesome contributing members of society.  28 Days wants to be a movie that zooms in on life for a small fraction of teen aged ladies who have surcumb to the evils of dope and booze and are on the road to productive recovery.Despite the serious subject matter what makes this movie fun, is the cast of odd ball characters on the druggie unit with the main character.  You just know by looking at this druggie program that it is populated with the posh more well to do upper crust crowd and their is nothing wrong with that.  Everyone is just slightly off kilter just enough to be interesting yet still beleivable.  I have found most dope addicts and boozers have their weird quirks.  It is said that what most in society consider an eccess of weirdness is the price paid by those whose level of inspired creativity allows them to think outside the box in chosen life pursuits.In the case of the main character as with so many creative types, she aches to be accepted by mainstream society.  Her pleas to be loved by polite society go unrequited as thinking outside the box creatively has become a pain for which drugs and or booze become her crutch.  One of the funniest parts of the movie has to be when her enabler boyfriend brings booze, a cheap diamond and his stupid boozed up - pro-druggie ideals to her on a boatride while she is in the treatment center.  This guy was such a TOTAL UTTER LOSER, while he sounded sincere in his every word he was also a sad black comedy because, there are really people out there who think exactly like him.28 Days (Special Edition) is a good DVD because despite its heavy subject matter it is still a ""very entertaining movie"".  Good fun solid Entertainment is something most druggie \ boozer finds redemption flicks usually do not do very well.  28 days is funny, entertaining while still holding on to its strong anti-drug message. Sandra Bullock is not bad to look at in this DVD, she does some good solid acting here and if Sandra is your cup of tea she shines like a diamond ever so nicely in for these 28 Days!

The film does not glamorize or poke fun at its thematic content, but instead shimmers in truth depicting the problems in which a nowhere life can lead. Why would anyone want to see a movie about someone spending time in rehab, regardless of how well crafted it is? Because ""28 Days"" is an interesting, sometimes funny, and involving tale with empathetic, down to earth characters, it is a production that should not pass by you without a watch.  The film's main character is named Gwen Cummings and is played by the talented Sandra Bullock. She lives a wild, crazy life with her boyfriend, Jasper (Dominic West). Gwen is an alcoholic and a drug addict, and does not get much support from her similar love interest. As the movie opens, the two get drunk at a club, come home, have sex, and put out a fire with wine. The next day, Gwen arrives late to her sister's wedding, only to destroy an expensive dessert and crash a limousine into a house.The Gwen Cummings character is developed clearly and effectively. We learn about her lifestyle, recognize faults, and are shown a dark history through painfully real flashbacks. This is one of the things that make ""28 Days"" so involving. We discover elements about the character and notice inner changes as she learns of them herself. I really cared about this character.  Gwen is given a choice, she can serve jail time for her wrongdoing or can waive that and spend 28 days in a rehab clinic. She chooses rehab. The head counselor is Cornell (Steve Buscemi), who shows empathy but also coyness. Also present at his heath clinic is an assortment of characters who sing sappy melodies and share group love, including Daniel (Reni Santoni), with thick glasses and medical capabilities, Andrea (Azura Skye), Gwen's young roommate, and Eddie Boone (Viggo Mortensen), a famous baseball pitcher with a drinking problem.Gwen's experiences in rehab seem truthful and accurate. Her withdrawals and agonies are realistic and knowledgeable. It is obvious the filmmakers and Sandra Bullock thoroughly researched the stresses and details of rehab.  Sandra Bullock performs with the right amount of immaturity and charisma. This wonderful actress is set free in this kind of heart filled role; she is best when the main character. Here, Gwen is free to tread the surface of the movie and still allows other characters to contribute to her defining.  About half way through, the movie losses its much needed focus on Gwen and drifts into detailing relationships, friendships, and other characters. While most of the events that take place surround Gwen, the movie was on the right track with its first half. ""28 Days"" is smart enough to recognize its blunder; however, and by the final scenes it regains the emotionally correct material and concludes with high standards. The filmmakers are advertising it as a comedy, but only an isolation of sequences offer hilarity or slapstick. This movie teaches us lessons through its characters and the lessons are well taught.",3,28 Days  (2000),1135987200,"12 31, 2005",2005,3417,"['Director', 'Betty', 'ThomasCast', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'Dominic', 'West', 'Elizabeth', 'Perkins', 'Azura', 'Skye', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'Alan', 'Tudyk', 'Mike', ""O'Malley"", 'Marianne', 'Jean-Baptiste', 'Reni', 'Santoni', 'Diane', 'Ladd.Running', 'Time', '103', 'minutesRated', 'PG-13', 'mature', 'thematic', 'elements', 'involving', 'substance', 'abuse', 'language', 'sensuality', '28', 'Days', 'one', 'most', 'accurate', 'yet', 'touching', 'movies', 'alcoholism', 'drug', 'addiction', 'film', 'not', 'glamorize', 'poke', 'fun', 'thematic', 'content', 'instead', 'shimmers', 'truth', 'depicting', 'problems', 'nowhere', 'life', 'can', 'lead', 'Why', 'would', 'anyone', 'want', 'see', 'movie', 'someone', 'spending', 'time', 'rehab', 'regardless', 'how', 'well', 'crafted', '28', 'Days', 'interesting', 'sometimes', 'funny', 'involving', 'tale', 'empathetic', 'down', 'earth', 'characters', 'production', 'should', 'not', 'pass', 'watch', 'film', 'main', 'character', 'named', 'Gwen', 'Cummings', 'played', 'talented', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'wild', 'crazy', 'life', 'boyfriend', 'Jasper', 'Dominic', 'West', 'Gwen', 'alcoholic', 'drug', 'addict', 'not', 'get', 'much', 'support', 'similar', 'love', 'interest', 'movie', 'two', 'get', 'drunk', 'club', 'come', 'home', 'have', 'sex', 'put', 'out', 'fire', 'wine', 'next', 'day', 'Gwen', 'late', 'sister', 'wedding', 'only', 'destroy', 'expensive', 'dessert', 'crash', 'limousine', 'house.The', 'Gwen', 'Cummings', 'character', 'developed', 'clearly', 'effectively', 'learn', 'lifestyle', 'recognize', 'faults', 'are', 'shown', 'dark', 'history', 'painfully', 'real', 'flashbacks', 'one', 'things', 'make', '28', 'Days', 'so', 'involving', 'discover', 'elements', 'character', 'notice', 'inner', 'changes', 'really', 'cared', 'character', 'Gwen', 'given', 'choice', 'can', 'serve', 'jail', 'time', 'wrongdoing', 'can', 'waive', 'spend', '28', 'days', 'rehab', 'clinic', 'rehab', 'head', 'counselor', 'Cornell', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'who', 'empathy', 'also', 'coyness', 'Also', 'present', 'heath', 'clinic', 'assortment', 'characters', 'who', 'sing', 'sappy', 'melodies', 'share', 'group', 'love', 'including', 'Daniel', 'Reni', 'Santoni', 'thick', 'glasses', 'medical', 'capabilities', 'Andrea', 'Azura', 'Skye', 'Gwen', 'young', 'roommate', 'Eddie', 'Boone', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'famous', 'baseball', 'pitcher', 'drinking', 'problem.Gwen', 'experiences', 'rehab', 'seem', 'truthful', 'accurate', 'withdrawals', 'agonies', 'are', 'realistic', 'knowledgeable', 'obvious', 'filmmakers', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'thoroughly', 'researched', 'stresses', 'details', 'rehab', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'performs', 'right', 'amount', 'immaturity', 'charisma', 'wonderful', 'actress', 'set', 'free', 'kind', 'heart', 'filled', 'role', 'best', 'when', 'main', 'character', 'Here', 'Gwen', 'free', 'tread', 'surface', 'movie', 'still', 'other', 'characters', 'contribute', 'defining', 'half', 'way', 'movie', 'losses', 'much', 'needed', 'focus', 'Gwen', 'drifts', 'detailing', 'relationships', 'friendships', 'other', 'characters', 'most', 'events', 'take', 'place', 'surround', 'Gwen', 'movie', 'was', 'right', 'track', 'first', 'half', '28', 'Days', 'smart', 'enough', 'recognize', 'blunder', 'however', 'final', 'scenes', 'emotionally', 'correct', 'material', 'high', 'standards', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'advertising', 'comedy', 'only', 'isolation', 'sequences', 'offer', 'hilarity', 'slapstick', 'movie', 'lessons', 'characters', 'lessons', 'are', 'well', 'taught']",28 Days

552448,AJYGQV81FSFE2,B00004UEDQ,Timothy P. Scanlon,"[1, 4]","Throughout the film, I asked myself, ""What's the point?"" Were the screenwriter or director trying to endorse treatment? Well, it was almost as obvious in the film as in real life that those in ""rehab"" had problems of which alcohol or drugs were a small part if at all. So the quality of the endorsement was dubious.One accuracy I should add is that most in ""treatment"" smoke like chimneys with no complaints from the center hierarchy while often absolutely forbidden to use other necessary medications, ones, needless to say, far less dangerous or life threatening than tobacco!When I saw Steve Buscemi,  taken a role because it may have made him a few bucks. But he was kind of funny, though his role wasn't intentionally that way. He was typical of center ""directors,"" whining constantly in every 12-step cliche in the book as to how ""we"" are all alike. I have this problem, so you have the same. ""That's the way life is."" Bullock acted well in rejecting that nonsense.The romantic portion of the story was predictible. You know, Bullock's boyfriend drinks too much, is a real social animal. While in ""treatment"" she falls to a degree for a baseball star also in treatment who can't keep his pants on. The two guys meet and get into a fight. Then the baseball star it seems STILL can't keep 'em on, and Bullock witnesses that. That was a theme not developed at all beyond the depth of a romance novel.Overall, I'd say the screenwriter and/or director took advantage of a fad of ""treatment,"" something to which conventional wisdom suggests more of us should have and developed a story around it. And Bullock's character took the unfortunate step of buying into what the ""treatment"" honchoes told her. A person as intelligent as her character seemed to be wouldn't have bought into it.There were new actors, and, again, some of the story is witty, so I don't totally reject the film. But take it from someone who knows: ""treatment"" doesn't work like that. If anyone is looking for a model of ""treatment"" to send a loved one, don't use this film as that model.

Ward,"[3, 3]","When I began watching this film, I had a sense early on that I might not like it all that much as I thought the character of Gwen and her drunken antics were somewhat overdone, until the scene where she crashes the limo. Such incidents do happen with addicts in denial and unaware of their dangerous behavior while under the influence. As the movie continued, I was impressed with how this film showed a realistic portrait of the events and situations that take place in a rehab facility. There is good humor throughout the film as humor is a needed assett when struggling through difficult times, but there is also debatable explanations on the meaning of life and why people make the choices they do as the scene with Gwen and her boyfriend gives an exchange of two very different outlooks on life. Gwen also comes to take accountability as she discovers the owning up process. The scenes involving her and her sister are touching and believable rather than coming off as forced or sappy, and the supporting characters grow on you despite their issues.
