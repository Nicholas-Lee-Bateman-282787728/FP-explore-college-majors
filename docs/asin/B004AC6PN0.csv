Well, it wasn't bad and she was interested but I guess she was too young for the actual story.

Ours still uses it and it  helped very much for her to learn her numbers.

1393211,ARJIAB8SLWAOU,B004AC6PN0,"George Buttner ""Agent0042""","[35, 36]","If you are your kids don't like the new redesign and style for these videos that began withLeapFrog: Let's Go to School, then feel free to skip. If, however, you or your kids still enjoy these videos then, ""Numbers Ahoy"" is another excellent release with a lot to love.""Numbers Ahoy"" was released along withLeapFrog: The Amazing Alphabet Amusement Park. As far as bonus content goes, everything included on this DVD is pretty much the same as ""Amusement Park"" and I already reviewed it for that one, so I'll just note that this DVD also includes its own set of useful commentaries by one of LeapFrog's educational consultants and also heavily features the new character, Scout the puppy.In this DVD, Tad & Lily want to play a board game called Numbers Ahoy, but find it problematic because it requires a lot of counting. Their big brother Leap teaches them the basics of the game, but they're still in trouble because they only know a bit of basic counting. So Edison uses his green learning stone to take them under the sea, where there are fun opportunities for counting fish and more.Unfortunately, there are also pirates floating about the sea, one of them being Pirate Pythagoras, who is scooping up any animal from the sea he can find in order to count them. When Scout ends up being one of the animals scooped up, Tad, Lily and Edison launch a mission to rescue him and encounter some surprising help.Along the way, they learn to count as high as twenty. They also learn about things such as estimation and about developing an instinctive ""number sense"" to tell them whether a particular number is higher or lower than other numbers. Much of it is presented through song, generally pretty catchy. The video also teaches other more general, pro-social skills as well (i.e. playing games fairly.)",5,Counting Reasons to Like This DVD,1295654400,"01 22, 2011",2011,1801,"['are', 'kids', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'new', 'redesign', 'style', 'videos', 'began', 'withLeapFrog', 'Let', 'Go', 'School', 'then', 'feel', 'free', 'skip', 'however', 'kids', 'still', 'enjoy', 'videos', 'then', 'Numbers', 'Ahoy', 'excellent', 'release', 'lot', 'love', 'Numbers', 'Ahoy', 'was', 'released', 'withLeapFrog', 'Amazing', 'Alphabet', 'Amusement', 'Park', 'As', 'far', 'bonus', 'content', 'everything', 'included', 'DVD', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'Amusement', 'Park', 'already', 'reviewed', 'one', 'so', ""'ll"", 'just', 'note', 'DVD', 'also', 'own', 'set', 'useful', 'commentaries', 'one', 'LeapFrog', 'educational', 'consultants', 'also', 'heavily', 'new', 'character', 'puppy.In', 'DVD', 'Tad', 'Lily', 'want', 'play', 'board', 'game', 'called', 'Numbers', 'Ahoy', 'find', 'problematic', 'lot', 'counting', 'big', 'brother', 'Leap', 'basics', 'game', ""'re"", 'still', 'trouble', 'only', 'know', 'bit', 'basic', 'counting', 'So', 'Edison', 'green', 'learning', 'stone', 'take', 'sea', 'where', 'are', 'fun', 'opportunities', 'counting', 'fish', 'more.Unfortunately', 'are', 'also', 'floating', 'sea', 'one', 'being', 'Pirate', 'Pythagoras', 'who', 'scooping', 'up', 'animal', 'sea', 'can', 'find', 'order', 'count', 'When', 'Scout', 'up', 'being', 'one', 'animals', 'scooped', 'up', 'Tad', 'Lily', 'Edison', 'launch', 'mission', 'rescue', 'encounter', 'surprising', 'way', 'learn', 'count', 'as', 'high', 'twenty', 'also', 'learn', 'things', 'such', 'estimation', 'developing', 'instinctive', 'number', 'sense', 'tell', 'particular', 'number', 'higher', 'lower', 'other', 'numbers', 'Much', 'presented', 'song', 'generally', 'pretty', 'catchy', 'video', 'also', 'other', 'more', 'general', 'pro-social', 'skills', 'well', 'i.e', 'playing', 'games', 'fairly']",LeapFrog: Numbers Ahoy
