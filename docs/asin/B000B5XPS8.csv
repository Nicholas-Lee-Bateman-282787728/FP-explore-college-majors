But even if it doesn't this is a great adventure movie. It keeps your interest, it's decent, no bad language, no nudity, or sexual content (that's one in a million).The actors all do a great job in the roles they play. Especially Iain Glenn, who plays the proud scottsman who loves his blue coat, who also played Mr. Preston in ""Wives and Daughters.""",5,great film,1275350400,"06 1, 2010",2010,442,"['have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'Kidnapped', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'movie', 'story', 'line', 'even', ""n't"", 'great', 'adventure', 'movie', 'interest', 'decent', 'bad', 'language', 'nudity', 'sexual', 'content', 'one', 'million', '.The', 'actors', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'roles', 'play', 'Especially', 'Iain', 'Glenn', 'who', 'proud', 'scottsman', 'who', 'blue', 'coat', 'who', 'also', 'played', 'Mr.', 'Preston', 'Wives', 'Daughters']",Robert Louis Stevensons's: Kidnapped

I found it to be stiff, dark and with the Scottish accents very hard to follow...I'm usually quite good at accents. The persona of the heroic Alan came across as a mixed up character, somewhere between Errol Flynn and Douglas Fairbanks and so stupid that the viewer only wants to give him a good kick!

936355,A20EJTAFI1VM5Z,B000B5XPS8,Eileen Cunningham,"[0, 0]","Though (like most book-to-movie adaptations) this movie takes some liberties with Stevenson's work, it at least hints at what all the fighting is about up there in the Highlands.  In our politically correct times, I doubt that the screenwriters wanted to get into the whole Catholic v. Protestant issue that underlies the book, but at least you know that Davie's clan (Protestants) and Allan's clan (Catholic) are at each other's throats.  The idea Stevenson was working with is that sometimes two persons from different backgrounds are thrown together by circumstances in which they must cooperate to bring about their mutual survival. In the struggle, they find in each other a basic human decency that transcends the political struggle around them. Despite the fact that the movie doesn't always follow the book, that basic idea still comes shining through.",4,It Has Its Points,1237248000,"03 17, 2009",2009,860,"['most', 'book-to-movie', 'adaptations', 'movie', 'liberties', 'Stevenson', 'work', 'least', 'hints', 'what', 'fighting', 'there', 'Highlands', 'politically', 'correct', 'times', 'doubt', 'screenwriters', 'wanted', 'get', 'whole', 'Catholic', 'v.', 'Protestant', 'issue', 'book', 'least', 'know', 'Davie', 'clan', 'Protestants', 'Allan', 'clan', 'Catholic', 'are', 'other', 'throats', 'idea', 'Stevenson', 'was', 'working', 'sometimes', 'two', 'persons', 'different', 'backgrounds', 'are', 'thrown', 'together', 'circumstances', 'must', 'cooperate', 'bring', 'about', 'mutual', 'survival', 'struggle', 'find', 'other', 'basic', 'human', 'decency', 'political', 'struggle', 'fact', 'movie', ""n't"", 'always', 'follow', 'book', 'idea', 'still', 'shining']",Robert Louis Stevensons's: Kidnapped

I thought the cast was fantastic, the locations were great, and the direction wasn't half bad.  I did read the reviews and they are probably right, but since I didn't read Steven's book I wasn't bothered by anything left out or messed up(Obviously).  So in conclusion if you want a good fun film from PBS buy this.  IF you are a fan of the book you should probably burn this thing(Judging on the other reviews), or, like me, you could enjoy a good old adventure tale....",5,Great fun on PBS(I'm still in shock : ),1163030400,"11 9, 2006",2006,570,"['Okay', 'okay', 'admit', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'Kidnapped', 'Thats', 'probably', 'why', 'enjoyed', 'so', 'much', 'thought', 'cast', 'was', 'fantastic', 'locations', 'were', 'great', 'direction', 'was', ""n't"", 'half', 'bad', 'did', 'read', 'reviews', 'are', 'probably', 'right', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'Steven', 'book', 'was', ""n't"", 'bothered', 'anything', 'left', 'out', 'messed', 'up', 'Obviously', 'So', 'conclusion', 'want', 'good', 'fun', 'film', 'PBS', 'buy', 'IF', 'are', 'fan', 'book', 'should', 'probably', 'burn', 'thing', 'Judging', 'other', 'reviews', 'could', 'enjoy', 'good', 'old', 'adventure', 'tale']",Robert Louis Stevensons's: Kidnapped

I had a tough time with many of the words, but no one would help me; they would always say: ""Look it up. That's how you learn.""Well, I did learn to love Stevenson's work and similar adventure tales; but, the reason I gave this adapted version of Stevenson's work four stars is the acting. I withhold one star for the deep changes to the original story that have already discussed here by other reviewers.The entire cast did an excellent job, but the work of Iain Glen, and especially of James Anthony Pearson, is something to write home about.Pearson's facial expressions alone are worth the price of admission, or, more accurately, the price of the DVD.Take a look at the brief flash of realization on this young actors face, when he tells the weaver that he thought she was a witch, and then he realizes that it was the wrong thing to say.Better still, watch Pearson/Davie's face in the background as Alan Breck and James-of-the-Glen have a heated discussion, which ends when James's daughter asks Pearson/Davie if he likes smelling like a goat.This young Pearson, has that special acting talent which allows him to manipulate his face so that it speaks volumes, without a word being said.
