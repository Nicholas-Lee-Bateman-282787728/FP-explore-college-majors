The only items they take with them are a knife, a bottle of water and a garbage bag each. A week into their journey, a disastrous turn of events changes everything and the men are forced to confront the darkest corners of their own morality and mortality.I hate to admit it but I actually liked this movie. Judging from the trailer that I had seen on the movie, I figured it'd be a movie that wouldn't amount to much. Boy, I was seriously wrong on this one(I love it when that happens). The movie was well-acted and believable, not only that but it kept my attention all the way up to the end.True, this movie does have its' shortcomings. First and foremost, the characters' backstory should have been more fleshed out as well as the motivations as to why each man was going on this quest. Second, the plot of the movie should have been more clear and not have taken so long to materialize. Other than that, that's about it.After viewing the movie, I look forward to what Director Roze has in store for films in the future. Deadfall Trail is a very good movie and definitely worth a looksee.",4,Deadfall Trail.......,1340582400,"06 25, 2012",2012,1213,"['Deadfall', 'Trail', 'story', 'three', 'men', 'who', 'go', 'three-week', 'trip', 'national', 'forest', 'peyote', 'vision', 'quest', 'only', 'items', 'take', 'are', 'knife', 'bottle', 'water', 'garbage', 'bag', 'week', 'journey', 'disastrous', 'turn', 'events', 'changes', 'everything', 'men', 'are', 'forced', 'confront', 'darkest', 'corners', 'own', 'morality', 'mortality.I', 'hate', 'admit', 'actually', 'liked', 'movie', 'Judging', 'trailer', 'had', 'seen', 'movie', 'figured', ""'d"", 'be', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'amount', 'much', 'Boy', 'was', 'seriously', 'wrong', 'one', 'love', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'well-acted', 'believable', 'not', 'only', 'kept', 'attention', 'way', 'end.True', 'movie', 'have', 'shortcomings', 'First', 'foremost', 'characters', 'backstory', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'fleshed', 'out', 'as', 'well', 'motivations', 'why', 'man', 'was', 'going', 'quest', 'Second', 'plot', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'clear', 'not', 'have', 'taken', 'so', 'long', 'materialize', 'Other', 'about', 'it.After', 'viewing', 'movie', 'look', 'forward', 'what', 'Director', 'Roze', 'store', 'films', 'future', 'Deadfall', 'Trail', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'definitely', 'looksee']",N/A

Julian (Shane Dean) is a seasoned no nonsense survivalist/camper. He has anger management issues and we don't know why. John (Slade Hall) is also a seasoned wilderness man. He is the moderate voice of reason in the group. Paul (Cavin Gray Schneider) is a rookie at this game, although craves danger. His existence on this trip irks Julian. The guys feed off bugs, berries, and grub worms. By day 2 Paul has failed to properly ration his water and is drinking his own urine.The goal of this threesome is to enter into the wooded area, kill a boar, and chew on some peyote. Things don't go as planned and Paul suddenly becomes the adult in the group.The movie was well acted. It also shows you some neat survivalist stuff, like how to build a combustible engine out of bird guano and tree bark (just kidding). There was just barely enough action going on to hold my attention until ""the incident."" By day 10, the drama really held my interest until about day 15 and then it was ""are we there yet?"" The ending caused me to drop a star. I don't see this as a horror/thriller.

1375988,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B003Y84OWK,trebe,"[0, 0]","Deadfall Trail (2009) is a wilderness adventure set in Arizona, where three men who set out to test their survival skills, face more of a challenge than they expected.  The film has good production values, and although the editing is a bit choppy, is generally shot pretty well.  Some of the acting doesn't ring true, and the story goes to some very strange places.  Major spoilers follow, so continue at your own risk.John (Slade Hall), and experienced outdoorsman is planning to go out into the wilderness with Julian (Shane Dean), another expert at surviving in the wild.  John brings along his buddy Paul (Cavin Gray), who has no experience in the kind of hardcore survivalist camping, the other two men have planned.  Paul's main interest seems to be getting high on peyote.  Julian and Paul are strangers, and tension develops between them early, as Julian was unaware that Paul was a total newbie.  Why John decided to bring Paul and why he did not inform him what he would be in for, is never addressed.As the journey continues, John tries to be a peacekeeper, but Julian makes no secret of his feelings, and his relationship with Paul gets more antagonistic.  Paul resents being treated like an idiot, his lack of knowledge, and the rules he is expected to follow.  He responds with anger, whenever he is corrected or criticized.The approach taken is like a hardcore test of manhood, as the men supposedly have little more than garbage bags and a bottle of water each.  They consume beetles, grubs, fruit, and whatever they can gather.  They have no canteen, tent, matches, axe, first aid kit, or means to call for help.  Are they being tough, or just foolish?  When John is gravely injured by a deadfall trap, the answer seems clear, as in the middle of the nowhere, his chances for survival are slim.The remainder of the story focuses on the struggle to stay alive, which becomes a strange, twisted, violent, and at times surreal experience, where drama and emotion run high.  Paul and Julian have been scrapping like teenage boys, and continue to battle in the film's last act, as Julian snaps under the pressure, and Paul proves to have learned a whole lot about surviving in the wild.  It's shocking, in a Lord of the Flies kind of way, and the film definitely has some realistic scenes, but there are also other times when reality is completely absent.The movie is built around Julian and Paul, characters who start out as being quite unlikeable, but for different reasons.  The two men have some remarkable conversations, where they attempt to work out their differences.  At times they sound like two rival WWF wrestlers.  Paul's survival skills improve exponentially, but it's not quite enough.  Although an entertaining film, the story does feel forced in places, and is also inconsistent and pretentious, as various obstacles to survival are glossed over.  The adventure stretches out a little too long, and by the end, the choppy editing style of the film gets pretty annoying.Ultimately, Deadfall Trail tells the story intended by the writers, and in the manner they probably intended it to be told.  Men confront and come to terms with nature, with one perhaps getting a little too close.",3,getting a little too close to nature...,1327536000,"01 26, 2012",2012,3211,"['Deadfall', 'Trail', '2009', 'wilderness', 'adventure', 'set', 'Arizona', 'where', 'three', 'men', 'who', 'set', 'out', 'test', 'survival', 'skills', 'face', 'more', 'challenge', 'expected', 'film', 'good', 'production', 'values', 'editing', 'bit', 'choppy', 'generally', 'shot', 'pretty', 'well', 'acting', ""n't"", 'ring', 'true', 'story', 'very', 'strange', 'places', 'Major', 'spoilers', 'follow', 'so', 'continue', 'own', 'risk.John', 'Slade', 'Hall', 'experienced', 'outdoorsman', 'planning', 'go', 'out', 'wilderness', 'Julian', 'Shane', 'Dean', 'expert', 'surviving', 'wild', 'John', 'buddy', 'Paul', 'Cavin', 'Gray', 'who', 'experience', 'kind', 'hardcore', 'survivalist', 'camping', 'other', 'two', 'men', 'have', 'planned', 'Paul', 'main', 'interest', 'be', 'getting', 'high', 'peyote', 'Julian', 'Paul', 'are', 'strangers', 'tension', 'develops', 'early', 'Julian', 'was', 'unaware', 'Paul', 'was', 'total', 'newbie', 'Why', 'John', 'decided', 'bring', 'Paul', 'why', 'did', 'not', 'inform', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'never', 'addressed.As', 'journey', 'John', 'be', 'peacekeeper', 'Julian', 'secret', 'feelings', 'relationship', 'Paul', 'more', 'antagonistic', 'Paul', 'being', 'treated', 'idiot', 'lack', 'knowledge', 'rules', 'expected', 'follow', 'anger', 'whenever', 'corrected', 'criticized.The', 'approach', 'taken', 'hardcore', 'test', 'manhood', 'men', 'supposedly', 'have', 'little', 'more', 'garbage', 'bags', 'bottle', 'water', 'consume', 'beetles', 'grubs', 'fruit', 'can', 'gather', 'have', 'canteen', 'tent', 'matches', 'axe', 'first', 'aid', 'kit', 'call', 'help', 'Are', 'being', 'tough', 'just', 'foolish', 'When', 'John', 'gravely', 'injured', 'deadfall', 'trap', 'answer', 'clear', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'chances', 'survival', 'are', 'slim.The', 'remainder', 'story', 'struggle', 'stay', 'alive', 'strange', 'twisted', 'violent', 'times', 'surreal', 'experience', 'where', 'drama', 'emotion', 'run', 'high', 'Paul', 'Julian', 'have', 'been', 'scrapping', 'teenage', 'boys', 'continue', 'battle', 'film', 'last', 'act', 'Julian', 'snaps', 'pressure', 'Paul', 'have', 'learned', 'whole', 'lot', 'surviving', 'wild', 'shocking', 'Lord', 'Flies', 'kind', 'way', 'film', 'definitely', 'realistic', 'scenes', 'are', 'also', 'other', 'times', 'when', 'reality', 'completely', 'absent.The', 'movie', 'built', 'Julian', 'Paul', 'characters', 'who', 'start', 'out', 'being', 'quite', 'unlikeable', 'different', 'reasons', 'two', 'men', 'have', 'remarkable', 'conversations', 'where', 'attempt', 'work', 'out', 'differences', 'times', 'sound', 'two', 'rival', 'WWF', 'wrestlers', 'Paul', 'survival', 'skills', 'improve', 'exponentially', 'not', 'quite', 'enough', 'entertaining', 'film', 'story', 'feel', 'forced', 'places', 'also', 'inconsistent', 'pretentious', 'various', 'obstacles', 'survival', 'are', 'glossed', 'adventure', 'out', 'little', 'too', 'long', 'end', 'choppy', 'editing', 'style', 'film', 'pretty', 'annoying.Ultimately', 'Deadfall', 'Trail', 'story', 'intended', 'writers', 'manner', 'probably', 'intended', 'be', 'told', 'Men', 'confront', 'come', 'terms', 'nature', 'one', 'perhaps', 'getting', 'little', 'too', 'close']",N/A
