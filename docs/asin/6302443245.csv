312700,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,6302443245,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[7, 8]","A pair of Oscar-winning actors, and a comedy about two widowed people finding second love. Not much can go wrong, right? Well, sadly Anthony Quinn and Sophia Loren are the main good things about ""The Black Orchid,"" which desperately tries to cover up its shortness of plot.Rose (Loren) is a young Italian-American mother, widowed when her husband was killed by mobsters. Since her love of luxury drove him to crime, Rose blames herself, and tries to amend by making artificial flowers to support herself and her young son. She isn't interested in anyone else... until she meets the wealthy, widowed Frank Valente (Quinn).Rose and Frank soon fall in love and become engaged, and Rose's young son is delighted to find that he will have a father at last. But Frank's daughter Mary (Ina Balin) becomes distraught when she hears the news, and Frank reluctantly breaks up with Rose. Will there be a happy ending for anyone?""Uninspired"" is the best word for ""Black Orchid"" -- nowhere in the movie does anything really make sense. It's a purely by-the-numbers romance flick, which putters along with little enthusiasm, right up to the predictable conclusion. There isn't even any sense of tension, except for Loren's dramatic way of speaking.The plot itself unfolds in basic movie fashion, but is way too short. Apparently realizing this, the makers threw in a plot twist -- Mary inflicting her Electra complex on dear Daddykins. It's very contrived, and at times it's almost comical. But of course, expect all twists to be untwisted in a matter of minutes, and with only a few heart-to-heart talks.The only good things about this tepid film are Quinn and Loren. Loren exudes passionate penitance and love as Rose, who is determined to make things right this time around. And she has amazing chemistry with Quinn, who has a rough, jovial charm that was quite different from the smooth guys who populated Hollywood.""The Black Orchid"" is a forgettable and contrived little romance, but Loren and Quinn are delightful. Too bad they weren't given a worthy script to follow.",2,Black rose,1162425600,"11 2, 2006",2006,2061,"['pair', 'Oscar-winning', 'actors', 'comedy', 'two', 'widowed', 'people', 'finding', 'second', 'love', 'Not', 'much', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', 'right', 'Well', 'sadly', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'Sophia', 'Loren', 'are', 'main', 'good', 'things', 'Black', 'Orchid', 'desperately', 'cover', 'up', 'shortness', 'plot.Rose', 'Loren', 'young', 'Italian-American', 'mother', 'widowed', 'when', 'husband', 'was', 'killed', 'mobsters', 'love', 'luxury', 'drove', 'crime', 'Rose', 'tries', 'amend', 'making', 'artificial', 'flowers', 'support', 'young', 'son', ""n't"", 'interested', 'anyone', 'else', 'wealthy', 'widowed', 'Frank', 'Valente', 'Quinn', '.Rose', 'Frank', 'soon', 'fall', 'love', 'become', 'engaged', 'Rose', 'young', 'son', 'delighted', 'find', 'will', 'have', 'father', 'last', 'Frank', 'daughter', 'Mary', 'Ina', 'Balin', 'distraught', 'when', 'news', 'Frank', 'reluctantly', 'up', 'Rose', 'Will', 'there', 'be', 'happy', 'ending', 'anyone', 'Uninspired', 'best', 'word', 'Black', 'Orchid', 'nowhere', 'movie', 'anything', 'really', 'make', 'sense', 'purely', 'by-the-numbers', 'romance', 'flick', 'little', 'enthusiasm', 'right', 'up', 'predictable', 'conclusion', ""n't"", 'even', 'sense', 'tension', 'Loren', 'dramatic', 'way', 'speaking.The', 'plot', 'basic', 'movie', 'fashion', 'way', 'too', 'short', 'Apparently', 'realizing', 'makers', 'threw', 'plot', 'twist', 'Mary', 'inflicting', 'Electra', 'complex', 'dear', 'Daddykins', 'very', 'contrived', 'times', 'almost', 'comical', 'course', 'expect', 'twists', 'be', 'untwisted', 'matter', 'minutes', 'only', 'few', 'heart-to-heart', 'only', 'good', 'things', 'tepid', 'film', 'are', 'Quinn', 'Loren', 'Loren', 'passionate', 'penitance', 'love', 'Rose', 'who', 'determined', 'make', 'things', 'right', 'time', 'around', 'amazing', 'chemistry', 'Quinn', 'who', 'rough', 'jovial', 'charm', 'was', 'quite', 'different', 'smooth', 'guys', 'who', 'populated', 'Hollywood', 'Black', 'Orchid', 'forgettable', 'contrived', 'little', 'romance', 'Loren', 'Quinn', 'are', 'delightful', 'bad', 'were', ""n't"", 'given', 'worthy', 'script', 'follow']",Black Orchid VHS

312703,A3CD5AJ49M308T,6302443245,"Gregory B. Mowery ""opera lover""","[0, 0]","I had not known about this movie until recently. I have tried to see or revisit Sophia Loren's films and this one truly surprised me. Loren is not always given the credit she deserves as an actress. Her beautiful face always expresses the situation her characters are faced with. She had that quality from the very beginning. She always seems to be in the moment. The camera loves her and she's never self-conscious. There is an organic quality to her reactions whether she's expressing joy or rage, passion or affection. Set in the 50s, this black and white film is about a bitter widow of a mobster, with a son who is in a reform school for constantly running away. She works non-stop as she's now the sole financial responsibility in the family. She's not interested in a relationship. Her next door neighbor in this New York neighborhood (Brooklyn? Little Italy?) wants to fix her up with one of her husband's card-playing friends. Anthony Quinn is also a widower living with his overly protective daughter (Ina Balin in her film debut). He's kinda dapper, but around Sophia, he's a nervous wreck. He's definitely smitten, but has to barge through a lot of her defenses to get her to notice that he's a good guy who is falling in love with her. His daughter has other ideas. When she begins to notice there might be something between her father and this woman, her reaction is extremely negative. She thinks the widow is a low-life because of her late husband's mob ties. On the cusp of her own marriage, the daughter tries to convince her fianc&eacute; they should not move to New Jersey as planned, but stay in her father's house. His work is in New Jersey and he is not interested in living in her father's house. This causes them to quarrel and break up. When the daughter finds out that her father has indeed proposed to the widow, she confronts them and flees to her bedroom, locking the door. She stays there avoiding her father and not responding to calls from her fiancee. In the end, it is the widow who confronts the daughter and reveals her own mis-guided notions of what a marriage should be. This is classic Martin Ritt territory. A master of the genre. The Long Hot Summer, The Sound and the Fury, Hud, The Great White Hope, Sounder, Pete 'n Tillie, and Norma Rae, all are smallish films about character. The details are in the acting. Sophia Loren carries the movie on her magnificent shoulders. Anthony Quinn take a bit to warm up--he's too nervous for such a slickly dressed guy. Once he settles down, Quinn takes command and turns in a fine performance. The daughter's character is far too one-dimensional. You're nearly hissing at her every appearance--she's so overly protective to the point of creepiness. Ritt evokes the time and place of this small but telling film. Not sure if Loren was considered for an Oscar nomination. It would take Two Women to make people see that she had something more than beauty as an actress. Here in 1958, it was more than obvious and for that reason alone, this film is worth your attention.",4,"Excellent ""Kitchen Sink"" Drama",1402531200,"06 12, 2014",2014,3051,"['had', 'not', 'known', 'movie', 'recently', 'have', 'tried', 'see', 'revisit', 'Sophia', 'Loren', 'films', 'one', 'truly', 'surprised', 'Loren', 'not', 'always', 'given', 'credit', 'actress', 'beautiful', 'face', 'always', 'situation', 'characters', 'are', 'faced', 'had', 'quality', 'very', 'beginning', 'always', 'be', 'moment', 'camera', 'never', 'self-conscious', 'organic', 'quality', 'reactions', 'expressing', 'joy', 'rage', 'passion', 'affection', 'Set', '50s', 'black', 'white', 'film', 'bitter', 'widow', 'mobster', 'son', 'who', 'reform', 'school', 'constantly', 'running', 'away', 'non-stop', 'now', 'sole', 'financial', 'responsibility', 'family', 'not', 'interested', 'relationship', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'New', 'York', 'neighborhood', 'Brooklyn', 'Little', 'Italy', 'fix', 'up', 'one', 'husband', 'card-playing', 'friends', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'also', 'widower', 'living', 'overly', 'protective', 'daughter', 'Ina', 'Balin', 'film', 'debut', 'kinda', 'dapper', 'Sophia', 'nervous', 'wreck', 'definitely', 'smitten', 'barge', 'lot', 'defenses', 'get', 'notice', 'good', 'guy', 'who', 'falling', 'love', 'daughter', 'other', 'ideas', 'When', 'notice', 'might', 'be', 'something', 'father', 'woman', 'reaction', 'extremely', 'negative', 'widow', 'low-life', 'late', 'husband', 'mob', 'ties', 'cusp', 'own', 'marriage', 'daughter', 'convince', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'should', 'not', 'move', 'New', 'Jersey', 'planned', 'stay', 'father', 'house', 'work', 'New', 'Jersey', 'not', 'interested', 'living', 'father', 'house', 'quarrel', 'break', 'up', 'When', 'daughter', 'out', 'father', 'indeed', 'proposed', 'widow', 'flees', 'bedroom', 'locking', 'door', 'there', 'avoiding', 'father', 'not', 'responding', 'calls', 'fiancee', 'end', 'widow', 'who', 'daughter', 'own', 'mis-guided', 'notions', 'what', 'marriage', 'should', 'be', 'classic', 'Martin', 'Ritt', 'territory', 'master', 'genre', 'Long', 'Hot', 'Summer', 'Sound', 'Fury', 'Hud', 'Great', 'White', 'Hope', 'Sounder', 'Pete', 'n', 'Tillie', 'Norma', 'Rae', 'are', 'smallish', 'films', 'character', 'details', 'are', 'acting', 'Sophia', 'Loren', 'movie', 'magnificent', 'shoulders', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'take', 'bit', 'warm', 'up', 'too', 'nervous', 'such', 'slickly', 'dressed', 'guy', 'Once', 'down', 'Quinn', 'command', 'fine', 'performance', 'daughter', 'character', 'far', 'too', 'one-dimensional', ""'re"", 'nearly', 'hissing', 'appearance', 'so', 'overly', 'protective', 'point', 'creepiness', 'Ritt', 'time', 'place', 'small', 'telling', 'film', 'Not', 'sure', 'Loren', 'was', 'considered', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'would', 'take', 'Two', 'Women', 'make', 'people', 'see', 'had', 'something', 'more', 'beauty', 'actress', 'Here', '1958', 'was', 'more', 'obvious', 'reason', 'alone', 'film', 'attention']",Black Orchid VHS
