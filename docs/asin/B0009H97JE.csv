Since then, I have read the books, and watched Green in his other crime series, Touching Evil.  If you like to watch films about police solving serial killer crimes, you will enjoy this.  The crimes are shocking, the denouement is interesting, and at the heart of the story is the developing relationship between Dr. Tony Hill (Green) and the police woman with whom he works these crimes.",5,Calling all Robson Green fans,1142208000,"03 13, 2006",2006,467,"['became', 'Robson', 'Green', 'fan', 'when', 'saw', 'first', 'season', 'Wire', 'Blood', 'then', 'have', 'read', 'books', 'watched', 'Green', 'other', 'crime', 'series', 'Touching', 'Evil', 'like', 'watch', 'films', 'police', 'solving', 'serial', 'killer', 'crimes', 'will', 'enjoy', 'crimes', 'are', 'shocking', 'denouement', 'interesting', 'heart', 'story', 'developing', 'relationship', 'Dr.', 'Tony', 'Hill', 'Green', 'police', 'woman', 'whom', 'crimes']",Wire in the Blood - Complete Second Season

While I am waiting for my Season 4 disc to arrive, I will try to control my jones by writing this review.Both Hermione Norris and Robson Green were unknown to this American prior to watching this series, but they are both fabulous in their respective roles as DCI Carol Jordan and profiler extraordinaire Dr. Tony Hill.  Dr. Hill can best be described as 'quirky', sometimes unsettlingly so, in his methods, and his ability to intuit the minds of twisted serial killers leaves him several bubbles off plumb in normal human interactions.  However, DCI Jordan is similarly laser-focused on her career, and over the episodes she and Dr. Hill have forged a real and tender bond that makes each the other's best and most reliable friend.  Though Carol and Tony often come tantalizingly close to becoming far more than friends and professional colleagues (and for these two rather damaged, very lonely people, we want them to stop dancing and just get it on already!), so far the series, prudently perhaps, keeps any romantic feelings bubbling under the surface but as yet unacted upon.There are unmistakable echoes of 'Prime Suspect's Jane Tennyson in Carol Jordan that go beyond blonde hair; Helen Mirren brought us a cautionary portrait of a workaholic police inspector whose career and natural inclination shut meaningful personal relationships out of her life until it's too late.  DCI Jordan is in danger of treading down that same path if she's not careful.  Perhaps (and I hope so) this series will finally wrap up with Tony and Carol as a couple, and save Carol from Jane Tennyson's fate.  In the meantime the dance is fun to watch.""Fun"" might perhaps be the wrong word for a series that is unabashedly grisly.  Really.  ""Wire in the Blood"" (and I sincerely hope I never find out what that means) is hands down the most graphic show I have seen.  Indeed there are scenes here that would have not been out of place in David Fincher's ""Se7en"".  American crime shows are fairly sanitized for this kind of thing, and we Yanks are a bit unprepared for the sheer amount of gore and even nudity of corpses which this show presents us.  Be advised that the crime scenes in this series require a strong stomach, and make anything on ""Law & Order"" look like a children's cartoon.  This show doesn't just push the envelope; it tears it completely.  I find a grudging admiration in the risks this show takes--and here I thought that British TV was supposed to be so boring!Robson Green is my new crush, and writer Val McDermid, who created the character says that Mr. Green is the 'definitive' Tony Hill as he existed in her imagination.  I know he certainly fires up my imagination, and has grown on me as this series has progressed.  If you're a fan of crime dramas, gird your stomach and watch this--you won't be sorry.",4,Infectiously Entertaining,1221004800,"09 10, 2008",2008,2877,"['just', 'finished', 'watching', 'Season', '3', 'am', 'officially', 'addicted', 'am', 'waiting', 'Season', '4', 'disc', 'arrive', 'will', 'try', 'control', 'jones', 'writing', 'review.Both', 'Hermione', 'Norris', 'Robson', 'Green', 'were', 'unknown', 'American', 'prior', 'watching', 'series', 'are', 'fabulous', 'respective', 'roles', 'DCI', 'Carol', 'Jordan', 'profiler', 'extraordinaire', 'Dr.', 'Tony', 'Hill', 'Dr.', 'Hill', 'can', 'best', 'be', 'described', ""'quirky"", 'sometimes', 'unsettlingly', 'so', 'methods', 'ability', 'intuit', 'minds', 'twisted', 'serial', 'killers', 'several', 'bubbles', 'off', 'plumb', 'normal', 'human', 'interactions', 'However', 'DCI', 'Jordan', 'similarly', 'laser-focused', 'career', 'episodes', 'Dr.', 'Hill', 'have', 'forged', 'real', 'tender', 'bond', 'other', 'best', 'most', 'reliable', 'friend', 'Carol', 'Tony', 'often', 'come', 'tantalizingly', 'close', 'becoming', 'far', 'more', 'friends', 'professional', 'colleagues', 'two', 'rather', 'damaged', 'very', 'lonely', 'people', 'want', 'stop', 'dancing', 'just', 'get', 'already', 'so', 'far', 'series', 'prudently', 'perhaps', 'romantic', 'feelings', 'bubbling', 'surface', 'yet', 'unacted', 'are', 'unmistakable', 'echoes', ""'Prime"", 'Suspect', 'Jane', 'Tennyson', 'Carol', 'Jordan', 'go', 'blonde', 'hair', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'brought', 'cautionary', 'portrait', 'workaholic', 'police', 'inspector', 'career', 'natural', 'inclination', 'shut', 'meaningful', 'personal', 'relationships', 'life', 'too', 'late', 'DCI', 'Jordan', 'danger', 'treading', 'down', 'same', 'path', 'not', 'careful', 'Perhaps', 'hope', 'so', 'series', 'will', 'finally', 'wrap', 'up', 'Tony', 'Carol', 'couple', 'save', 'Carol', 'Jane', 'Tennyson', 'fate', 'meantime', 'dance', 'fun', 'watch', 'Fun', 'might', 'perhaps', 'be', 'wrong', 'word', 'series', 'unabashedly', 'grisly', 'Really', 'Wire', 'Blood', 'sincerely', 'hope', 'never', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'hands', 'most', 'graphic', 'show', 'have', 'seen', 'Indeed', 'are', 'scenes', 'here', 'would', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'place', 'David', 'Fincher', 'Se7en', 'American', 'crime', 'shows', 'are', 'fairly', 'sanitized', 'kind', 'thing', 'Yanks', 'are', 'bit', 'unprepared', 'sheer', 'amount', 'gore', 'even', 'nudity', 'corpses', 'show', 'Be', 'advised', 'crime', 'scenes', 'series', 'strong', 'stomach', 'make', 'anything', 'Law', 'Order', 'look', 'children', 'cartoon', 'show', ""n't"", 'just', 'push', 'envelope', 'completely', 'find', 'grudging', 'admiration', 'risks', 'show', 'here', 'thought', 'British', 'TV', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'so', 'boring', 'Robson', 'Green', 'new', 'crush', 'writer', 'Val', 'McDermid', 'who', 'created', 'character', 'Mr.', 'Green', ""'definitive"", 'Tony', 'Hill', 'existed', 'imagination', 'know', 'certainly', 'up', 'imagination', 'grown', 'series', 'progressed', ""'re"", 'fan', 'crime', 'dramas', 'gird', 'stomach', 'watch', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'sorry']",Wire in the Blood - Complete Second Season

905477,A106016KSI0YQ,B0009H97JE,Jay Dickson,"[0, 0]","The second season of WIRE IN THE BLOOD, based on the Val MacDermid Tony Hill/Carol Jordan mysteries, is much more assured than the second season. The episodes are shorter: (instead of two one-hour shows each of the stories is one episode that runs at roughly ninety minutes), and the mysteries are much more interesting. Though the serial killers Hill and Jordan track down in the Northern city of Bradfield are no less arcane than in the first series (one of the killers in this set of episodes takes as an M. O. the methods of heretic hunters and witchfinders in the late fifteenth century), they are more original. The true delight is again the fine actor Robson Green as the awkward but gifted criminal psychologist Tony Hill, who can accurately replicate the mindset of violent criminals with remarkable results. It is almost impossible to believe Robson has elsewhere played a handsome leading man, given his shambling nerdy walk and his general air of distraction here as Hill; his immersion in the character seems complete. One of the pleasures of this series is how different each episode from each other: the first concerns a cruel serial rapist; the second, the religious killings of the ""heretics"" (with some remarkable scenes of magic that are cleverly explained only by the episode's end); the third, a series of violent killings that mirror exactly those of a crime boss already behind bars; and the fourth, a mysterious rash of apparent mercy killings in a large city hospital. There is a strange habit in these episodes of shooting inexplicable situations for Tony Hill to be involved in that are only explained later in somewhat ridiculous fashion--an apparent sexual coupling with a student, a marriage in his garden, and a murder of a beautiful blonde woman in her bed--, but the ideas are fresh, and the acting terrific: Hermione Norris seems even more confident here than before as DCI Jordan, and she and Green have a nice gentle chemistry.",4,In the minds of killers,1263427200,"01 14, 2010",2010,1963,"['second', 'season', 'WIRE', 'IN', 'THE', 'BLOOD', 'based', 'Val', 'MacDermid', 'Tony', 'Hill/Carol', 'Jordan', 'mysteries', 'much', 'more', 'assured', 'second', 'season', 'episodes', 'are', 'shorter', 'instead', 'two', 'one-hour', 'shows', 'stories', 'one', 'episode', 'roughly', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'mysteries', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'serial', 'killers', 'Hill', 'Jordan', 'track', 'down', 'Northern', 'city', 'Bradfield', 'are', 'less', 'arcane', 'first', 'series', 'one', 'killers', 'set', 'episodes', 'M.', 'O.', 'methods', 'heretic', 'hunters', 'witchfinders', 'late', 'fifteenth', 'century', 'are', 'more', 'original', 'true', 'delight', 'again', 'fine', 'actor', 'Robson', 'Green', 'awkward', 'gifted', 'criminal', 'psychologist', 'Tony', 'Hill', 'who', 'can', 'accurately', 'replicate', 'mindset', 'violent', 'criminals', 'remarkable', 'results', 'almost', 'impossible', 'believe', 'Robson', 'elsewhere', 'played', 'handsome', 'leading', 'man', 'given', 'shambling', 'nerdy', 'walk', 'general', 'air', 'distraction', 'here', 'Hill', 'immersion', 'character', 'complete', 'One', 'pleasures', 'series', 'how', 'different', 'episode', 'other', 'first', 'cruel', 'serial', 'rapist', 'second', 'religious', 'killings', 'heretics', 'remarkable', 'scenes', 'magic', 'are', 'cleverly', 'explained', 'only', 'episode', 'end', 'third', 'series', 'violent', 'killings', 'mirror', 'exactly', 'crime', 'boss', 'already', 'bars', 'fourth', 'mysterious', 'rash', 'apparent', 'mercy', 'killings', 'large', 'city', 'hospital', 'strange', 'habit', 'episodes', 'shooting', 'inexplicable', 'situations', 'Tony', 'Hill', 'be', 'involved', 'are', 'only', 'explained', 'later', 'somewhat', 'ridiculous', 'fashion', 'apparent', 'sexual', 'coupling', 'student', 'marriage', 'garden', 'murder', 'beautiful', 'blonde', 'woman', 'bed', 'ideas', 'are', 'fresh', 'acting', 'terrific', 'Hermione', 'Norris', 'even', 'more', 'confident', 'here', 'before', 'DCI', 'Jordan', 'Green', 'have', 'nice', 'gentle', 'chemistry']",Wire in the Blood - Complete Second Season

905489,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B0009H97JE,Stephanie De Pue,"[2, 3]","""Wire in the Blood,"" another strong British television detective series, is based upon the work of prize-winning British author Val McDermid; it's based in her fictional Midlands city of Bradfield, which she undoubtedly based upon the very real Midlands city of Manchester, where she worked as a journalist for 16 years, and still lives.  It's filmed in the little-seen-here Midlands, rather than London, of which we see so much, and as such, it has a real background feel to it.  It's a crime drama/police procedural, dealing as a rule with the capture of serial killers (a theme some of us may find we've seen too much), and it is gritty, sometimes gory.  McDermid, of course, is considered one of the leading lights of the school of British mystery writing known as tartan noir -- rather more violent and bloody than the usual, and, thankfully, lightened occasionally by that dour Scots humor.  Written by a Scot, duh, which McDermid is. And all those English seem to whisper while they work: it could sure use subtitles.The series advertises itself these days as ""based upon characters created"" by McDermid. Robson Green stars as Dr. Tony Hill, psychologist-academic-profiler, giving a wondrous performance; handsome, praises be, intense, intelligent, fallible and flexible.  He is ably supported by Hermione Norris as Detective Chief Inspector Carol Jordan, Emma Hardy as DC Paula McIntyre, and Mark Letheren as DS Kevin Geoffries.  And they all seem to whisper while they work: the series could sure use subtitles.Unfortunately, McDermid hasn't written nearly enough to keep a series going, and the episodes collected in Series 2, which are written by others, are not up to her standard.  For those of you who've never had the privilege, she's a daring writer, breaking new ground with every step; and her best work is troubling, intensely gory and violent; frequently involving torture of a sexual nature.  Unfortunately, the four episodes that comprise this series just don't go there.Disk 1, ""Still She Cries,"" is the strongest, involving Maggie Thomas, a troubled, convicted female serial killer in jail for life(many people would argue that, in fact, there never has been a female serial killer; the American, Aileen Wuornos, was not a proactive hunter, merely a reactive.)  It also involves a predatory, pretty blond student of Hill's, and a new serial killer preying on pretty blond girls.Disk 2,""The Darkness of Light,"" concerns an overly religious young woman.  Somewhere on the internet, I noted a comment from a British crime scene investigator to the effect that the hotel room in which a murder takes place in this episode is, in fact, the hotel room in which a murder once took place.Disk 3, ""The Right to Silence,"" opens on a particularly gruesome murder, body found at a slaughterhouse.  The work appears to be that of a local gangster, already imprisoned.  The story is made a bit stronger by father/son, and brother/brother arcs.Disk 4, ""Sharp Compassion.""  Someone's killing very sick people in a hospital.  And somehow terrorists, and MI5 are shoehorned in.The series takes its name from an early Dr. Hill book:The Wire in the Blood (Dr. Tony Hill and Carol Jordan Mysteries). That book was violent in the extreme, and considerably cleaned up for Series 1.  I recommend it whole-heartedly, but not if violence disturbs you.  I understand the title quote comes from a poem by T.S. Eliot, and rather meant an irresistible urge to kill.  At one time, while he was writingBlood Work; I believe, Michael Connelly, currently most popular American crime writer, mentioned ""Wire in the Blood,"" and said he was going to collaborate on the writing of it. (He had a habit of mentioning past and future books, in each book he then wrote.)  In the event, of course, McDermid wrote ""Wire"" alone.  Well, the current TV series is worth watching - watered-down McDermid is better than no McDermid - but don't judge the author's writing by it.",3,Whisper While You Work,1210896000,"05 16, 2008",2008,3951,"['Wire', 'Blood', 'strong', 'British', 'television', 'detective', 'series', 'based', 'work', 'prize-winning', 'British', 'author', 'Val', 'McDermid', 'based', 'fictional', 'Midlands', 'city', 'Bradfield', 'undoubtedly', 'based', 'very', 'real', 'Midlands', 'city', 'Manchester', 'where', 'worked', 'journalist', '16', 'years', 'still', 'filmed', 'little-seen-here', 'Midlands', 'rather', 'London', 'see', 'so', 'much', 'such', 'real', 'background', 'feel', 'crime', 'drama/police', 'procedural', 'dealing', 'rule', 'capture', 'serial', 'killers', 'theme', 'may', 'find', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'too', 'much', 'gritty', 'sometimes', 'gory', 'McDermid', 'course', 'considered', 'one', 'leading', 'lights', 'school', 'British', 'mystery', 'writing', 'known', 'tartan', 'noir', 'rather', 'more', 'violent', 'bloody', 'usual', 'thankfully', 'lightened', 'occasionally', 'dour', 'Scots', 'humor', 'Written', 'Scot', 'duh', 'McDermid', 'English', 'seem', 'whisper', 'work', 'could', 'sure', 'use', 'subtitles.The', 'series', 'days', 'based', 'characters', 'created', 'McDermid', 'Robson', 'Green', 'stars', 'Dr.', 'Tony', 'Hill', 'psychologist-academic-profiler', 'giving', 'wondrous', 'performance', 'handsome', 'be', 'intense', 'intelligent', 'fallible', 'flexible', 'ably', 'supported', 'Hermione', 'Norris', 'Detective', 'Chief', 'Inspector', 'Carol', 'Jordan', 'Emma', 'Hardy', 'DC', 'Paula', 'McIntyre', 'Mark', 'Letheren', 'DS', 'Kevin', 'Geoffries', 'seem', 'whisper', 'work', 'series', 'could', 'sure', 'use', 'subtitles.Unfortunately', 'McDermid', ""n't"", 'written', 'nearly', 'enough', 'keep', 'series', 'going', 'episodes', 'collected', 'Series', '2', 'are', 'written', 'others', 'are', 'not', 'standard', 'who', ""'ve"", 'never', 'had', 'privilege', 'daring', 'writer', 'breaking', 'new', 'ground', 'step', 'best', 'work', 'troubling', 'intensely', 'gory', 'violent', 'frequently', 'involving', 'torture', 'sexual', 'nature', 'Unfortunately', 'four', 'episodes', 'comprise', 'series', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'there.Disk', '1', 'Still', 'Cries', 'strongest', 'involving', 'Maggie', 'Thomas', 'troubled', 'convicted', 'female', 'serial', 'killer', 'jail', 'life', 'many', 'people', 'would', 'argue', 'fact', 'never', 'been', 'female', 'serial', 'killer', 'American', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', 'was', 'not', 'proactive', 'hunter', 'merely', 'reactive', 'also', 'predatory', 'pretty', 'blond', 'student', 'Hill', 'new', 'serial', 'killer', 'preying', 'pretty', 'blond', 'girls.Disk', '2', 'Darkness', 'Light', 'overly', 'religious', 'young', 'woman', 'Somewhere', 'internet', 'noted', 'comment', 'British', 'crime', 'scene', 'investigator', 'effect', 'hotel', 'room', 'murder', 'place', 'episode', 'fact', 'hotel', 'room', 'murder', 'once', 'took', 'place.Disk', '3', 'Right', 'Silence', 'particularly', 'gruesome', 'murder', 'body', 'found', 'slaughterhouse', 'work', 'be', 'local', 'gangster', 'already', 'imprisoned', 'story', 'made', 'bit', 'stronger', 'father/son', 'brother/brother', 'arcs.Disk', '4', 'Sharp', 'Compassion', 'Someone', 'killing', 'very', 'sick', 'people', 'hospital', 'somehow', 'terrorists', 'MI5', 'are', 'shoehorned', 'in.The', 'series', 'name', 'early', 'Dr.', 'Hill', 'book', 'Wire', 'Blood', 'Dr.', 'Tony', 'Hill', 'Carol', 'Jordan', 'Mysteries', 'book', 'was', 'violent', 'extreme', 'considerably', 'cleaned', 'up', 'Series', '1', 'recommend', 'whole-heartedly', 'not', 'violence', 'disturbs', 'understand', 'title', 'quote', 'poem', 'T.S', 'Eliot', 'rather', 'meant', 'irresistible', 'urge', 'kill', 'one', 'time', 'was', 'writingBlood', 'Work', 'believe', 'Michael', 'Connelly', 'currently', 'most', 'popular', 'American', 'crime', 'writer', 'mentioned', 'Wire', 'Blood', 'said', 'was', 'going', 'collaborate', 'writing', 'had', 'habit', 'mentioning', 'past', 'future', 'books', 'book', 'then', 'wrote', 'event', 'course', 'McDermid', 'wrote', 'Wire', 'alone', 'Well', 'current', 'TV', 'series', 'worth', 'watching', 'watered-down', 'McDermid', 'better', 'McDermid', 'do', ""n't"", 'judge', 'author', 'writing']",Wire in the Blood - Complete Second Season
905490,A3G8AMJ33GBBFZ,B0009H97JE,Steven Lovotti,"[0, 0]",This is an outstanding series with Dr Hill being so unique. Its hard to tell sometimes whether he should be a patient or the pyschologist. His relationship with Carol is warm and thier friendship is beneficial to both of them. Its nice to see a woman actor play a script where it is written for a women. In American series the woman's role is written for a man and just play by a woman. It really makes it cartoonish. Wire In the Blood's characters are complete people with faults and emotions. I love this series and hopefully everyone will get a chance to see it.,5,Wire in the Blood,1215993600,"07 14, 2008",2008,565,"['outstanding', 'series', 'Dr', 'Hill', 'being', 'so', 'unique', 'hard', 'tell', 'sometimes', 'should', 'be', 'patient', 'pyschologist', 'relationship', 'Carol', 'warm', 'thier', 'friendship', 'beneficial', 'nice', 'see', 'woman', 'actor', 'play', 'script', 'where', 'written', 'women', 'American', 'series', 'woman', 'role', 'written', 'man', 'just', 'play', 'woman', 'really', 'cartoonish', 'Wire', 'Blood', 'characters', 'are', 'complete', 'people', 'faults', 'emotions', 'love', 'series', 'hopefully', 'everyone', 'will', 'get', 'chance', 'see']",Wire in the Blood - Complete Second Season

905492,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B0009H97JE,Z Hayes,"[0, 0]","I discovered this series quite by accident. Having lovedPlace of Execution, I was keen to read the novel (which inspired the TV adaptation) by Val McDermid. The novel was very well-written, and a nail-biting suspense thriller. Then I discovered that Val McDermid wrote other novels as well, and a couple of them inspired the TV crime drama Wire in the Blood.I have become a fan of this TV series which follows the investigations led by DI later DCI Carol Jordan (Hermione Norris). She is assisted by clinical psychologist Dr. Tony Hill (Robson Green), a rather eccentric figure who delves deeply into the minds of serial killers, studies patterns of criminal behavior and profiles criminals. His methods may seem strange at times, but he always manages to get results. Both Jordan and Hill make a strange if compelling pair, with Jordan analyzing a case based on evidence, and Hill working based on his knowledge of deviant behavior and what makes people commit disturbing crimes.Unlike some of the ""cozy"" mysteries such as the long-running Midsomer Murders and The Inspector Lynley Mysteries, Wire in the Blood is not for the faint of heart. The crimes are horrific, patterned on deviant behavior and the suspects are almost always very disturbed individuals. The crime scenes are difficult to watch as are the way victims are found and even the forensic examinations are graphic and unsettling. Though compelling, this is not really a show to watch in one sitting, and may very well give viewers nightmares.The third season contains four episodes:Redemption - young boys are found murdered, and investigations reveal these boys came from abusive homes. Tony's research and investigations discover a serial killer who thinks the killings are an act of mercy.Bad Seed - a dangerous killer nicknamed Mack the Knife is pronounced rehabilitated and set free, but Tony is not convinced the man has changed his ways. Then a spate of gruesome murders occur and Tony and DCI Jordan must do all they can to find the killer before more lives are lost.Nothing But the Night - one of the most twisted plots so far in the series. A series of murders leave both DCI Jordan and Tony Hill baffled. There does not seem to be a connection between the victims, but then Tony discovers there may be a link after all, and more than one perpetrator may be involved.Synchronicity - there's a sniper on the loose and DCI Jordan's investigations are made even more complicated when Tony discovers he has a brain tumor, one which appears to be growing.The writing on this crime drama is excellent, and Robson Green is credible as the clinical psychologist who has a rare knack for profiling and getting under the skin of some of the most dangerous criminals. The drama also explores the chemistry and tension between Hill and DCI Jordan, all of which result in a riveting show.I downloaded the entire Series Three, and the quality of the streaming was very good overall, as was picture quality.",5,This show just gets better with each season!,1318464000,"10 13, 2011",2011,2969,"['discovered', 'series', 'quite', 'accident', 'Having', 'lovedPlace', 'Execution', 'was', 'keen', 'read', 'novel', 'inspired', 'TV', 'adaptation', 'Val', 'McDermid', 'novel', 'was', 'very', 'well-written', 'nail-biting', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'Then', 'discovered', 'Val', 'McDermid', 'wrote', 'other', 'novels', 'well', 'couple', 'inspired', 'TV', 'crime', 'drama', 'Wire', 'Blood.I', 'have', 'become', 'fan', 'TV', 'series', 'investigations', 'led', 'DI', 'later', 'DCI', 'Carol', 'Jordan', 'Hermione', 'Norris', 'assisted', 'clinical', 'psychologist', 'Dr.', 'Tony', 'Hill', 'Robson', 'Green', 'rather', 'eccentric', 'figure', 'who', 'deeply', 'minds', 'serial', 'killers', 'studies', 'patterns', 'criminal', 'behavior', 'profiles', 'criminals', 'methods', 'may', 'seem', 'strange', 'times', 'always', 'get', 'results', 'Jordan', 'Hill', 'make', 'strange', 'compelling', 'pair', 'Jordan', 'analyzing', 'case', 'based', 'evidence', 'Hill', 'working', 'based', 'knowledge', 'deviant', 'behavior', 'what', 'people', 'commit', 'disturbing', 'crimes.Unlike', 'cozy', 'mysteries', 'such', 'long-running', 'Midsomer', 'Murders', 'Inspector', 'Lynley', 'Mysteries', 'Wire', 'Blood', 'not', 'faint', 'heart', 'crimes', 'are', 'horrific', 'patterned', 'deviant', 'behavior', 'suspects', 'are', 'almost', 'always', 'very', 'disturbed', 'individuals', 'crime', 'scenes', 'are', 'difficult', 'watch', 'are', 'way', 'victims', 'are', 'found', 'even', 'forensic', 'examinations', 'are', 'graphic', 'unsettling', 'compelling', 'not', 'really', 'show', 'watch', 'one', 'sitting', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'give', 'viewers', 'nightmares.The', 'third', 'season', 'four', 'episodes', 'Redemption', 'young', 'boys', 'are', 'found', 'murdered', 'investigations', 'reveal', 'boys', 'came', 'abusive', 'homes', 'Tony', 'research', 'investigations', 'discover', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'killings', 'are', 'act', 'mercy.Bad', 'Seed', 'dangerous', 'killer', 'nicknamed', 'Mack', 'Knife', 'pronounced', 'rehabilitated', 'set', 'free', 'Tony', 'not', 'convinced', 'man', 'changed', 'ways', 'Then', 'spate', 'gruesome', 'murders', 'occur', 'Tony', 'DCI', 'Jordan', 'must', 'do', 'can', 'find', 'killer', 'more', 'lives', 'are', 'lost.Nothing', 'Night', 'one', 'most', 'twisted', 'plots', 'so', 'far', 'series', 'A', 'series', 'murders', 'leave', 'DCI', 'Jordan', 'Tony', 'Hill', 'baffled', 'not', 'seem', 'be', 'connection', 'victims', 'then', 'Tony', 'discovers', 'may', 'be', 'link', 'more', 'one', 'perpetrator', 'may', 'be', 'involved.Synchronicity', 'sniper', 'loose', 'DCI', 'Jordan', 'investigations', 'are', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'complicated', 'when', 'Tony', 'brain', 'tumor', 'one', 'be', 'growing.The', 'writing', 'crime', 'drama', 'excellent', 'Robson', 'Green', 'credible', 'clinical', 'psychologist', 'who', 'rare', 'knack', 'profiling', 'getting', 'skin', 'most', 'dangerous', 'criminals', 'drama', 'also', 'chemistry', 'tension', 'Hill', 'DCI', 'Jordan', 'result', 'riveting', 'show.I', 'downloaded', 'entire', 'Series', 'Three', 'quality', 'streaming', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'overall', 'was', 'picture', 'quality']",Wire in the Blood - Complete Second Season
