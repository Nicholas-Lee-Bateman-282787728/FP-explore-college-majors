I stopped watching because the accent gets thick and the story is depressing: an angry, humiliating scar on the face of American history.  I have studied records and correspondence.  People in general were better than this.  They may have been poor and experienced hardship, but our forebears were decent, dignified, principled human beings.

1541262,AOJMD3AH1YSOW,B0081FSMPG,,"[1, 4]","I have to laugh at the one negative review. Great acting, production, directing etc. but the story is ""not uplifting"". Well, go watch a show about rainbows and unicorns if that's your taste. This is drama and true to life. Life is dirty and gritty. Personally I think this is the best thing I've seen in a long time. The acting is superb. From what I've read the story has been ""Hollywoodized"" a bit. Some things have been changed. The romance between Johnse Hatfield and Roseanna McCoy is overblown. The families were already intermarried several times. Some of the McCoys took the Hatfield side and vice versa. The main story is true though. ""Devil Anse"" Hatfield and Randolph McCoy were friends who had a falling out and they reached such a level of hate and jealousy that many other people were drawn into their personal feud resulting in 30+ years of murder and mayhem. Rather than high ideals the main reasons for the feud were probably economic. Fights over timber rights. The stolen hog, etc. Perry Cline was a major player, too. He was in there stirring things up for his own good, although he was already married and had no love interest in Roseanna McCoy. Despite the liberties taken I believe it is basically pretty true. A grudge taken to the nth degree.",5,Great piece of history.,1338422400,"05 31, 2012",2012,1267,"['have', 'laugh', 'one', 'negative', 'review', 'Great', 'acting', 'production', 'directing', 'etc', 'story', 'not', 'uplifting', 'Well', 'go', 'watch', 'show', 'rainbows', 'unicorns', 'taste', 'drama', 'true', 'life', 'Life', 'dirty', 'gritty', 'Personally', 'think', 'best', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'acting', 'superb', 'what', ""'ve"", 'read', 'story', 'been', 'Hollywoodized', 'bit', 'things', 'have', 'been', 'changed', 'romance', 'Johnse', 'Hatfield', 'Roseanna', 'McCoy', 'overblown', 'families', 'were', 'already', 'intermarried', 'several', 'times', 'McCoys', 'took', 'Hatfield', 'side', 'vice', 'versa', 'main', 'story', 'true', 'though', 'Devil', 'Anse', 'Hatfield', 'Randolph', 'McCoy', 'were', 'friends', 'who', 'had', 'falling', 'out', 'reached', 'level', 'hate', 'jealousy', 'many', 'other', 'people', 'were', 'drawn', 'personal', 'feud', 'resulting', '30+', 'years', 'murder', 'mayhem', 'Rather', 'high', 'ideals', 'main', 'reasons', 'feud', 'were', 'probably', 'economic', 'Fights', 'timber', 'rights', 'stolen', 'hog', 'etc', 'Perry', 'Cline', 'was', 'major', 'player', 'too', 'was', 'stirring', 'things', 'up', 'own', 'good', 'was', 'already', 'married', 'had', 'love', 'interest', 'Roseanna', 'McCoy', 'liberties', 'taken', 'believe', 'basically', 'pretty', 'true', 'grudge', 'taken', 'nth', 'degree']",N/A

Kevin Costner and Bill Paxton bring their A-game acting skills to this series and made it watchable to any fan of drama television.  My schooling experience failed to inform me about the Hatfield and McCoy feud, so I learned a lot (yes, I know they over embellish and make up some things for TV) and I had a great time watching what would happen next.  There was a few times where I was on the edge of my seat, wide-eyed, staring at the screen.  Overall, if you like great TV dramas, I would highly recommend this because it will not disappoint.Also as a side note, I kept on thinking how there was so much action, but they still managed to squeeze in some great writing, I kept thinking that this is how the Walking Dead should be; predominantly action packed, with great writing and not so much pretentious, overly dramatic, acting.",4,Very Entertaining Television!,1339113600,"06 8, 2012",2012,992,"['have', 'never', 'been', 'fan', 'westerns', 'civil', 'war', 'stories', 'really', 'anything', 'do', 'south', 'be', 'honest', 'series', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'entertaining', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'bring', 'A-game', 'acting', 'skills', 'series', 'made', 'watchable', 'fan', 'drama', 'television', 'schooling', 'experience', 'failed', 'inform', 'Hatfield', 'McCoy', 'feud', 'learned', 'lot', 'yes', 'know', 'embellish', 'make', 'up', 'things', 'TV', 'had', 'great', 'time', 'watching', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'next', 'was', 'few', 'times', 'where', 'was', 'edge', 'seat', 'wide-eyed', 'staring', 'screen', 'Overall', 'like', 'great', 'TV', 'dramas', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'will', 'not', 'disappoint.Also', 'side', 'note', 'kept', 'thinking', 'how', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'action', 'still', 'managed', 'squeeze', 'great', 'writing', 'kept', 'thinking', 'how', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'should', 'be', 'predominantly', 'action', 'packed', 'great', 'writing', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'pretentious', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'acting']",N/A
1541264,A18UBPBIKPQMPE,B0081FSMPG,,"[2, 6]","I rate this production 3 stars because of casting, costumes, props and  cinematography (all of which rate 4 to 5 stars), but I rate the teleplay as 2 stars. The teleplay elevates Costner character (Devil Hatfield) to superhuman status - typical in Costner films - while roping viewers into liberal cliches about the Civil War, life in southern back-country, sex and Christianity.Typical of Devil Hatfield character development is the opening scene of this series in which, single-handed, Costner wards off a company-sized assault by Union forces after explaining to Bill Paxton's character (Randall McCoy) that he doesn't need no Christian God to help him. Moreover, McCoy's character development is Christian and according to liberal cliches - McCoy is never superhuman, is married to a wife more plain than secular Hatfields' busty brunette, and is palpably less intelligent than the all-knowing Hatfield.The cast of characters - all back country southerners - are depicted, according to liberal cliche, as dependent upon moonshine for income and hydration, given to irresponsible sex, squalid living and occasional church attendance under direction of hypocritical preachers. If you'e old enough to remember the ""Bonanza"" television series, Costner plays the equivalent of Ben Cartwright, all-knowing, all-wise land baron amidst lesser mortals.The final reason the teleplay rates just 2 stars is the way in which it draws the viewer into the vengeful life of the warring families - the film appeals to our baser instincts. As the story unfolds the viewer finds himself targeting certain characters for assassination, just as in the film ""Godfather"" one actually feels sympathy at times for the mob Corleone family. Great writers can depict evil without maneuvering to resonate with the evil that lies dormant, most of the time, within all (or, at least most) of us.",3,Costner's God Complex & Liberal Cliches,1350777600,"10 21, 2012",2012,1868,"['rate', 'production', '3', 'stars', 'casting', 'costumes', 'props', 'cinematography', 'rate', '4', '5', 'stars', 'rate', 'teleplay', '2', 'stars', 'teleplay', 'Costner', 'character', 'Devil', 'Hatfield', 'superhuman', 'status', 'typical', 'Costner', 'films', 'roping', 'viewers', 'liberal', 'cliches', 'Civil', 'War', 'life', 'southern', 'back-country', 'sex', 'Christianity.Typical', 'Devil', 'Hatfield', 'character', 'development', 'opening', 'scene', 'series', 'single-handed', 'Costner', 'wards', 'off', 'company-sized', 'assault', 'Union', 'forces', 'explaining', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'character', 'Randall', 'McCoy', ""n't"", 'need', 'Christian', 'God', 'help', 'Moreover', 'McCoy', 'character', 'development', 'Christian', 'according', 'liberal', 'cliches', 'McCoy', 'never', 'superhuman', 'married', 'wife', 'more', 'plain', 'secular', 'Hatfields', 'busty', 'brunette', 'palpably', 'less', 'intelligent', 'all-knowing', 'Hatfield.The', 'cast', 'characters', 'back', 'country', 'southerners', 'are', 'depicted', 'according', 'liberal', 'cliche', 'dependent', 'moonshine', 'income', 'hydration', 'given', 'irresponsible', 'sex', 'squalid', 'living', 'occasional', 'church', 'attendance', 'direction', 'hypocritical', 'preachers', ""'"", 'e', 'old', 'enough', 'remember', 'Bonanza', 'television', 'series', 'Costner', 'equivalent', 'Ben', 'Cartwright', 'all-knowing', 'all-wise', 'land', 'baron', 'lesser', 'mortals.The', 'final', 'reason', 'teleplay', 'rates', 'just', '2', 'stars', 'way', 'viewer', 'vengeful', 'life', 'warring', 'families', 'film', 'appeals', 'baser', 'instincts', 'story', 'viewer', 'targeting', 'certain', 'characters', 'assassination', 'just', 'film', 'Godfather', 'one', 'actually', 'sympathy', 'times', 'mob', 'Corleone', 'family', 'Great', 'writers', 'can', 'depict', 'evil', 'maneuvering', 'resonate', 'evil', 'dormant', 'most', 'time', 'least', 'most']",N/A
1541265,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B0081FSMPG,,"[5, 18]","When I heard about this series coming to television I thought it could be interesting. When I heard that Kevin Costner and Bill Paxton were starring I definitely wanted to see how they did. My DVR wasn't working at the time so I was glad to hear it was coming to DVD. Unfortunately the series didn't live up to my expectations.We all know the basics of the story, two warring families in the West Virginia/Kentucky area in the late 1800s. This show goes a little more in depth than any we've heard before starting with the original men who were friends only to become deadly enemies later in life.Anse Hatfield (Costner) and Randall McCoy (Paxton) are seen fighting for the Confederacy as the show opens. Tired of the killing and battle, certain that they're working for a losing cause, Anse decides to quit and head home. Randall disagrees and stays only to be captured while the rest of their unit is all killed.Anse returns home to start a lumber business and work the land with his family. Randall comes home after years in a battlefield prison, a beaten man and one who won't forgive Anse for leaving him behind. Added to this is the fact that Anse' Uncle Jim has killed a relative of Randall (without witnesses) and the feud between the two families is started.Along the way various arguments and battles between the two families continue. With as many members of both as are seen here it makes you wonder if there were any other families living in the same area at the time! Bloodshed sways back and forth, hate festers between not just the two men but their families as well and no happy ending is in sight.So why was it a disappointment? It was boring! The movie moves along at a snails pace giving us details of each and every incident that happens between the two families. The smallest slight is given screen time and the eventual outcome is evident from the start. Perhaps the makers of this series were hoping to give some depth to the story we've all been told, but do we really need the amount of depth they offer here? I found myself on more than one occasion checking the time display on the DVD player to find out just how much was left to watch and that was just on the first disc!The acting is all over the place. Tom Berenger as Uncle Jim does a good job of being dislikeable. Costner does a great job at trying to bring harmony to the situation, trying to resolve problems only to be stopped dead in his tracks and forced to change into the mean old SOB he becomes. Paxton, an actor I've always thought highly of, just seems to be a one note ball of anger throughout.The locations used here look drab and unattractive. Having family in West Virginia (thought I haven't been there in some time) I know that the area looks much better than presented here. Perhaps the idea was to show it in the worst light possible to go along with the way things were in those days.The biggest problem with this show remains the length and the fact that it is boring, taking far too much time to tell the story. Great mini-series have always taken time to unfold a story but those have always held our attention from start to finish. While this isn't the worst mini-series ever it does offer little entertainment value except for pure history buffs.",2,SLOW DOESN'T DESCRIBE IT,1344470400,"08 9, 2012",2012,3255,"['When', 'heard', 'series', 'coming', 'television', 'thought', 'could', 'be', 'interesting', 'When', 'heard', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'were', 'starring', 'definitely', 'wanted', 'see', 'how', 'did', 'DVR', 'was', ""n't"", 'working', 'time', 'was', 'glad', 'hear', 'was', 'coming', 'DVD', 'Unfortunately', 'series', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'expectations.We', 'know', 'basics', 'story', 'two', 'warring', 'families', 'West', 'Virginia/Kentucky', 'area', 'late', '1800s', 'show', 'little', 'more', 'depth', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'starting', 'original', 'men', 'who', 'were', 'only', 'become', 'deadly', 'enemies', 'later', 'life.Anse', 'Hatfield', 'Costner', 'Randall', 'McCoy', 'Paxton', 'are', 'seen', 'fighting', 'Confederacy', 'show', 'Tired', 'killing', 'battle', 'certain', ""'re"", 'working', 'losing', 'cause', 'Anse', 'quit', 'head', 'home', 'Randall', 'only', 'be', 'captured', 'rest', 'unit', 'killed.Anse', 'returns', 'home', 'start', 'lumber', 'business', 'work', 'land', 'family', 'Randall', 'home', 'years', 'battlefield', 'prison', 'beaten', 'man', 'one', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'forgive', 'Anse', 'leaving', 'Added', 'fact', 'Anse', 'Uncle', 'Jim', 'killed', 'relative', 'Randall', 'witnesses', 'feud', 'two', 'families', 'started.Along', 'way', 'various', 'arguments', 'battles', 'two', 'families', 'continue', 'many', 'members', 'are', 'seen', 'here', 'wonder', 'were', 'other', 'families', 'living', 'same', 'area', 'time', 'Bloodshed', 'back', 'forth', 'hate', 'festers', 'not', 'just', 'two', 'men', 'families', 'well', 'happy', 'ending', 'sight.So', 'why', 'was', 'disappointment', 'was', 'boring', 'movie', 'along', 'snails', 'pace', 'giving', 'details', 'incident', 'two', 'families', 'smallest', 'slight', 'given', 'screen', 'time', 'eventual', 'outcome', 'evident', 'start', 'Perhaps', 'makers', 'series', 'were', 'hoping', 'give', 'depth', 'story', ""'ve"", 'been', 'told', 'do', 'really', 'need', 'amount', 'depth', 'offer', 'here', 'found', 'more', 'one', 'occasion', 'checking', 'time', 'display', 'DVD', 'player', 'find', 'out', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'was', 'left', 'watch', 'was', 'just', 'first', 'disc', 'acting', 'place', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'Uncle', 'Jim', 'good', 'job', 'being', 'dislikeable', 'Costner', 'great', 'job', 'trying', 'bring', 'harmony', 'situation', 'trying', 'resolve', 'problems', 'only', 'be', 'stopped', 'dead', 'tracks', 'forced', 'change', 'mean', 'old', 'SOB', 'Paxton', 'actor', ""'ve"", 'always', 'thought', 'highly', 'just', 'be', 'one', 'note', 'ball', 'anger', 'throughout.The', 'locations', 'used', 'here', 'look', 'drab', 'unattractive', 'Having', 'family', 'West', 'Virginia', 'thought', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'there', 'time', 'know', 'area', 'much', 'better', 'presented', 'here', 'Perhaps', 'idea', 'was', 'show', 'worst', 'light', 'possible', 'go', 'along', 'way', 'things', 'were', 'days.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'show', 'length', 'fact', 'boring', 'taking', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'tell', 'story', 'Great', 'mini-series', 'have', 'always', 'taken', 'time', 'unfold', 'story', 'have', 'always', 'held', 'attention', 'start', 'finish', ""n't"", 'worst', 'mini-series', 'ever', 'offer', 'little', 'entertainment', 'value', 'pure', 'history', 'buffs']",N/A
