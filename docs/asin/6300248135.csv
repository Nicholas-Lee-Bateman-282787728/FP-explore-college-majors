227433,A3GI6DS6I474K8,6300248135,"Alan Draven ""Dark Fiction Author""","[6, 10]","Seth Brundle (Goldblum) is a scientist who might just have invented the world's first teleporter. The only bug (pun intended) is the fact that it doesn't handle flesh and live teleportations. Ronnie (Geena Davis) is a writer for Particle magazine and will stay by his side, documenting via video his attempts to break through. Upon successfully teleporting a baboon, Seth gets cocky and decides to try and teleport himself; a fly slips into the pod while he teleports. At first, Seth finds newfound strength and agility, but pretty soon he's changing for the worst.This is one of Cronenberg's best films, masterfully directed and executed. It's also Jeff Goldblum's finest performance to date! Not content on doing a mere remake (the original Fly (1958) is a much different film starring Vincent Price), Cronenberg brings this film to the next level--literally. It's filled with deep human drama and let's not forget the award-winning special effects! Top notch effects contribute in putting this film ahead of the pack of other mid-eighties sci-fi/horror flicks. The film overall has aged well (it's already been twenty years) if not for the eighties fashion statements.I'm having a hard time figuring out which it is more; a sci-fi or a horror film? I guess it's a fusion of both (I gotta stop these bad puns!). Whether you see it for the first time or revisit it, Cronenberg's The Fly is a great gory, character-driven, profoundly human film. The second disc is chock full of special features: various documentaries and a making-of, screenplays, the original short story on which the original film is based, trailers for all the Fly movies ever made, deleted scenes, and much much more.

227435,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6300248135,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 4]","I wasn't expecting much from `The Fly'.  I actually thought that it looked rather corny, and I loathe the actor that is Jeff Goldblum almost all of the time so it was really a stroke I luck that I decided to even give this movie a try.  My friends were all talking about it one day and I felt left out, beings that I was the only one of us who had yet to see it and so I rented it and watched it and, get this, loved it.The film centers around brilliant scientist Seth Brundle, a man on the verge of greatness.  He invites journalist Veronica `Ronnie' Quaife back to his place to see the glorious invention he has been working on, and once she witnesses its potential she becomes absorbed in Brundle's life.  Brundle has created a device that can transport matter from one pod to another.  The machine is not able to handle living matter yet, but that is a bug Brundle is working out.  When Brundle finally does decide to test his machine on himself he finds that the results are much more than he expected.Cronenberg brilliantly crafts `The Fly' into a top notch horror film, a film that is as scary as it is dreadful; as gory as it is detestable, but it also has a beating heart, and that is not something a lot of films of this nature possess.  As Seth transforms into the dreadful Brundlefly we see his mental capabilities leaving him, and as he turns into something dangerous to the ones he loves (namely Ronnie) we can see genuine humanity in his fight to save her (and eventually himself).  There are moments towards the end of the film that recalled `King Kong' to me, watching Ronnie crumble as her beloved is destroyed before her eyes.One thing I noticed that I thought was really interesting was the fact that in the opening scenes, where Seth is showing Ronnie his work, their eyes are glossed over and practically bulging from their skulls.  They truly appear to be `buglike' and I really think this small detail adds layers to the films depth of character.So that brings me to the acting.Like I mentioned on the outset, I generally loathe Goldblum.  He is usually a very annoying actor in my eyes.  Here though he is spot on perfection.  This was truly the perfect role for him.  Every one of his usual mannered ticks are in full form here, but they work beautifully.  I truly can't see anyone else playing Seth.  Geena Davis is also wonderful here.  I actually love her as an actress and think that she has continued to deliver film after film.  As Ronnie she brings a true raw emotional connection to the film.  Without her dedication to her performance the films moral would have went unnoticed, but her believability as Seth deteriorates before her is really what solidifies this films greatness.So, in the end, `The Fly' is truly one of Cronenberg's finest films, it may even be his best (I openly admit to not having seen all of his work, but of what I have seen I think this, along with `A History of Violence' is my favorite).  `The Fly' is truly a brillaint horror film, but even more than that it is a brilliant film; period.  Cronenberg has a way of getting under our skin and festering, and `The Fly' is no exception to that talent.",5,"I want to create a new word specifically for this movie, and that word is `horrortastic'...",1217980800,"08 6, 2008",2008,3158,"['was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'Fly', 'actually', 'thought', 'looked', 'rather', 'corny', 'loathe', 'actor', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'almost', 'time', 'was', 'really', 'stroke', 'luck', 'decided', 'even', 'give', 'movie', 'try', 'friends', 'were', 'talking', 'one', 'day', 'felt', 'left', 'out', 'beings', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'had', 'yet', 'see', 'so', 'rented', 'watched', 'get', 'loved', 'it.The', 'film', 'centers', 'brilliant', 'scientist', 'Seth', 'Brundle', 'man', 'verge', 'greatness', 'journalist', 'Veronica', 'Ronnie', 'Quaife', 'back', 'place', 'see', 'glorious', 'invention', 'been', 'working', 'once', 'potential', 'absorbed', 'Brundle', 'life', 'Brundle', 'created', 'device', 'can', 'transport', 'matter', 'one', 'pod', 'machine', 'not', 'able', 'handle', 'living', 'matter', 'yet', 'bug', 'Brundle', 'working', 'out', 'When', 'Brundle', 'finally', 'decide', 'test', 'machine', 'results', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'brilliantly', 'crafts', 'Fly', 'top', 'notch', 'horror', 'film', 'film', 'as', 'scary', 'dreadful', 'as', 'gory', 'detestable', 'also', 'beating', 'heart', 'not', 'something', 'lot', 'films', 'nature', 'possess', 'Seth', 'transforms', 'dreadful', 'Brundlefly', 'see', 'mental', 'capabilities', 'leaving', 'something', 'dangerous', 'ones', 'namely', 'Ronnie', 'can', 'see', 'genuine', 'humanity', 'fight', 'save', 'eventually', 'are', 'moments', 'end', 'film', 'recalled', 'King', 'Kong', 'watching', 'Ronnie', 'crumble', 'beloved', 'destroyed', 'eyes.One', 'thing', 'noticed', 'thought', 'was', 'really', 'interesting', 'was', 'fact', 'opening', 'scenes', 'where', 'Seth', 'showing', 'Ronnie', 'work', 'eyes', 'are', 'glossed', 'practically', 'bulging', 'skulls', 'truly', 'appear', 'be', 'really', 'think', 'small', 'detail', 'layers', 'films', 'depth', 'character.So', 'acting.Like', 'mentioned', 'outset', 'generally', 'loathe', 'Goldblum', 'usually', 'very', 'annoying', 'actor', 'eyes', 'Here', 'spot', 'perfection', 'was', 'truly', 'perfect', 'role', 'one', 'usual', 'mannered', 'ticks', 'are', 'full', 'form', 'here', 'work', 'beautifully', 'truly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'anyone', 'else', 'playing', 'Seth', 'Geena', 'Davis', 'also', 'wonderful', 'here', 'actually', 'love', 'actress', 'think', 'continued', 'deliver', 'film', 'film', 'Ronnie', 'true', 'raw', 'emotional', 'connection', 'film', 'dedication', 'performance', 'films', 'moral', 'would', 'have', 'went', 'unnoticed', 'believability', 'Seth', 'really', 'what', 'films', 'greatness.So', 'end', 'Fly', 'truly', 'one', 'Cronenberg', 'finest', 'films', 'may', 'even', 'be', 'best', 'openly', 'admit', 'not', 'having', 'seen', 'work', 'what', 'have', 'seen', 'think', 'History', 'Violence', 'favorite', 'Fly', 'truly', 'brillaint', 'horror', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'brilliant', 'film', 'period', 'Cronenberg', 'way', 'getting', 'skin', 'festering', 'Fly', 'exception', 'talent']",The Fly VHS

On the contrary the opposite was true. When I first saw it at 12 it was SO scary I could not even watch the final transformation sequence at the end. This is the ONLY horror film which I could not watch from start to finish. Even to this day I never look at flies the same way. I've discovered that I like horror films that are scary enough to get my adrenaline pumping but not enough to make me feel disturbed for a long time afterwards.The acting is superb, the special effects look real, and the script is good. In fact, if anything it is too perfect because if it wasn't I wouldn't have to take it so seriously! The reason why I'm giving it 5 stars is because, quite frankly, it deserves it as it is a genuine horror movie that does exactly what it sets out to do: scare you and disgust more in 2 hours than what your imagination could do in 2 years.If you are looking for a GOOD horror movie this is right place to look.

Sure, at first you're flying around like a monkey from the rafters, and rocking and rolling the king-size with your Cassanova wiles. But soon enough, you despise other flesh, mumbling in the dim static, acid-reflux in overtime, dribbling all over your sugar cakes. And your acne has gone plaid.It is by now fairly well known that Nancy Reagan was a scriptwriter on the latter installments of the ""Halloween"" and ""Friday the 13th"" franchises (as well as ""April Fool's Day"" and ""Happy Birthday to Me"") during her ""Just Say No"" campaign in the 1980s. Nancy would come up with the goriest ways to kill wayward teen campers loose from too much reefer, while having tea with Anhk, who was in charge of Ronnie's naptime bed-wetting vision quests. These experiments were crude, but effective while humans were consigned to live in a clunky, pre-Internet world.But it wasn't until ""The Fly"" -- which I at first mistook for a conspiracy involving scientists, under the command of the corporations, turning the populace insectile, a people consumed only with consuming, and rotting in self-made, technological wastelands -- that I began to realize that drugs aren't cool.

227439,A2582KMXLK2P06,6300248135,B. E Jackson,"[2, 2]","I admit right away that I LOVE the Fly!  Sure now that I'm older the film's truly not as frightening as it once was.  Seeing a man gradually transform into a human-sized house fly day by day isn't something that can actually happen, but it sure is entertaining to watch.  In fact I'd go so far as to say the Fly barely feels like a horror movie to me now.  I've either watched too many scary movies over the years and simply got used to them or maybe the actual horror elements of the Fly just don't hold up like they once did.  We *are* going back to the mid 80's after all when cheesiness in movies, TV shows and music was running wild.  Either way, who cares?  This movie is flat out exciting.  The writing is almost spot-on perfect.  It succeeds at everything but freaking me out.It's about a man who creates a teleportation machine that enables one object to go from one machine to another.  He lives inside an apartment building and meets a journalist woman who can't wait to write an article about this.  Eventually the man gets a little impatient and perhaps arrogant and wants to risk the potential consequences by putting *himself* in the machine.  He insists on finding out if he can go through with the teleportation and walk away without any side effects.  That my friends, is a BAD idea!  And wouldn't you know it?  An innocent little fly happened to be inside the machine and sticking to the side of the window while the man was busy going from machine to machine.  No big deal right?  It's just a fly.  What's the worst that can happen?  Oh I dunno... everything.Anyway the man steps out of the machine and believes he's perfectly fine.  However, after a while the fly similarities begin to develop for the man.  Slowly but surely, he becomes a fly!  He doesn't realize it at first however.  He just chalks up his unusual body-changing symptoms and hyperactive admiration for lust as something that can be dismissed.  This all probably sounds really cheesy to read but the movie is actually really well-done in the storytelling department.  You'll want to stick with this one until its conclusion to see what finally happens.I guess my memory isn't as good as it once was.  Even though it's been over 20 years since I last watched the Fly, I could have sworn there was more development in how the man changes into a fly than there was, but last night while watching the movie it seemed like it was, well, not incomplete per say, but like there were a few details and segments eliminated.  Not sure if this particular version sold on amazon has any missing scenes, and I don't even know if scenes were deleted at all in *any* version for that matter.  It's probably just an episode of forgetfulness I'm going through.Either way, my dad loves this movie as much as I do.  I remember he'd watch it on laidback Sunday afternoons in the late 80's/early 90's.  Highly recommended entertainment but don't expect it to be as terrifying as you probably remember it (or especially if you're seeing it for the first time).  On a final note while laying in bed watching this movie at 3 in the morning last night, my attention is temporarily forced towards the outside of my bedroom window where I see a green light raining down from the sky.  It was a shooting star (unless someone was shooting fireworks at 3 in the morning when it was 0 degrees outside... nah!)

Of course, to be fair, Brundle's innovative theories do not appear so 'mad' to begin with, and are probably even well-intentioned to start (perhaps just overly ambitious) - and it is really only after his DNA begins to 'merge' with the Fly (and its insectoid-influenced brain patterns) = that Seth Brundle's own thinking seems to become somewhat more diabolical (or at least more in tune with Fly-logic).Geena Davis is incredibly charismatic as 'Veronica' the boundlessly intrepid, and exceedingly 'bright' reporter who takes an immediate interest & liking to Brundle and his seemingly far-out theories - and even follows him to his laboratory (out in the boondocks = looking like a true mad-scientist's hidden Lair!)The depth-perception really intensifies as we watch the relationship between Veronica and Seth progress and evolve (or perhaps devolve!) as the persona of 'Brundle-Fly' begins to assert itself!Don't want to give away the Story for those who haven't already seen this, but there are some truly fascinating, chilling, and even gruesome scenes awaiting the viewer (but Cronenberg is a cinematic master of effectively elevating the 'gross' to a level of high-art).Anyway, very effective, and even moving at times and certainly prescient (more so now as the term 'genetically-modified' has become commonplace, than when this film first appeared twenty-eight years ago!)",5,"Probably the Most Effective, Frightening but Endlessly Fascinating Speculative Fiction/Horror Film, Ever Made!!",1400889600,"05 24, 2014",2014,2274,"['David', 'Cronenberg', '1986', 'version', 'Classic', '1950', 'horror-SciFi', 'movie', 'Fly', 'imaginative', 'perceptive', 'genuinely', 'frightening', 'highly', 'effective', 'regards', 'presenting', 'quintessential', 'portrait', 'modern', 'day', 'inexorably', 'driven', 'push', 'prod', 'even', 'subvert', 'laws', 'nature/', 'genetics/', 'exceeding', ""'accepted"", 'scientific', 'norms', '==', '>', 'order', 'achieve', 'literal', ""'quantum"", 'Leap', 'ie', 'particular', 'case', 'matter-deconstruction/', 'reconstruction', 'transport', 'very', 'intriguing', 'premise', 'think', 'what', 'really', 'film', 'apart', 'most', 'other', ""'genre"", 'pictures', 'believability', 'magnetism', 'two', 'Leads', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'Geena', 'Davis', 'Goldblum', ""'Seth"", 'Brundle', '=', 'eccentric', 'genius', 'extra', 'dose', ""'mad-spark"", 'veritable', 'conglomeration', 'J.', 'Robert', 'Oppenheimer', '+', 'Nikola', 'Tesla', '+', 'Victor', 'Frankenstein', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure', 'course', 'be', 'fair', 'Brundle', 'innovative', 'theories', 'do', 'not', 'appear', 'so', ""'mad"", 'begin', 'are', 'probably', 'even', 'well-intentioned', 'start', 'perhaps', 'just', 'overly', 'ambitious', 'really', 'only', 'DNA', ""'merge"", 'Fly', 'insectoid-influenced', 'brain', 'patterns', '=', 'Seth', 'Brundle', 'own', 'thinking', 'become', 'somewhat', 'more', 'diabolical', 'least', 'more', 'tune', 'Fly-logic', '.Geena', 'Davis', 'incredibly', 'charismatic', ""'Veronica"", 'boundlessly', 'intrepid', 'exceedingly', ""'bright"", 'reporter', 'who', 'immediate', 'interest', 'liking', 'Brundle', 'seemingly', 'far-out', 'theories', 'even', 'laboratory', 'boondocks', '=', 'looking', 'true', 'mad-scientist', 'hidden', 'Lair', 'depth-perception', 'really', 'watch', 'relationship', 'Veronica', 'Seth', 'progress', 'evolve', 'perhaps', 'devolve', 'persona', ""'Brundle-Fly"", 'begins', 'assert', 'Do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'Story', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'seen', 'are', 'truly', 'fascinating', 'chilling', 'even', 'gruesome', 'scenes', 'awaiting', 'viewer', 'Cronenberg', 'cinematic', 'master', 'effectively', 'elevating', ""'gross"", 'level', 'high-art', '.Anyway', 'very', 'effective', 'even', 'moving', 'times', 'certainly', 'prescient', 'more', 'so', 'now', 'term', ""'genetically-modified"", 'become', 'commonplace', 'when', 'film', 'first', 'appeared', 'twenty-eight', 'years', 'ago']",The Fly VHS

227442,A1KB2VS9JTCTHQ,6300248135,Bug DeLug,"[4, 5]","Let me state from the beginning that this is my favourite film of all time. I am a huge movie buff and have a massive library of dvd's, and yet somehow this still remains my number one. There are many reasons for this- film races along at a terrific pace throughout and is the perfect meld of sci-fi, horror and drama. The direction by David Cronenberg is simply sublime. Jeff Goldblum, Geena Davis and John Getz are all perfectly cast in their roles. The effects are still strong and hold up nearly 25 years after the films initial release.The story follows Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum), who is working on something quite big- a pair of telepods that allow for instant teleportation. The film begins with him inviting the lovely Vernonica Quaife (Geena Davis) back to his apartment/ lab to see what he has been working on. She is amazed at what she finds and the two of them decide that she will follow him and write a book about his invention. Before long the two fall in love, and her boss (John Getz) gets extremely jealous of this; beginning an intriguing love triangle. In the meantime, something went wrong when Seth Brundlefly teleported himself for the first time. Something got in there with him and went undetected, causing genetic splicing between himself and a housefly. From thereon things get extremely weird, and gory...I cannot rave about this film enough. Jeff Goldblum gives one of the truly quintessential lead performances in his role of Seth Brundle- from his nerdy, awkward beginnings to his horrific demise in the final third. I won't spoil anything for the uninitiated other than to say this is like a superhero movie gone wrong. Instead of becoming selfless and heroic as a result of the splicing incident, he becomes hell-bent on self preservation. The movie has been seen as an allegory for everything from AIDS to heroin addiction.As for the blu-ray transfer - it really is quite impressive. The effects look terrific in high-definition, and though it will not become a show-off disc it is a vast improvement over the previous dvd releases. The extras are the same as the special dvd edition that was released a few years back, and there is the addition of a new trivia track. When you consider that one of those extras is a 3 hour-plus documentary about the making of the film, this becomes a no-brainer. I highly recommend both the excellent movie and the wholly decent blu-ray release.",5,The best 80's movie?,1273622400,"05 12, 2010",2010,2417,"['Let', 'state', 'beginning', 'favourite', 'film', 'time', 'am', 'huge', 'movie', 'buff', 'have', 'massive', 'library', 'dvd', 'yet', 'somehow', 'still', 'number', 'one', 'are', 'many', 'reasons', 'this-', 'film', 'races', 'along', 'terrific', 'pace', 'perfect', 'meld', 'sci-fi', 'horror', 'drama', 'direction', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'simply', 'sublime', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'Geena', 'Davis', 'John', 'Getz', 'are', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'roles', 'effects', 'are', 'still', 'strong', 'hold', 'up', 'nearly', '25', 'years', 'films', 'initial', 'release.The', 'story', 'Seth', 'Brundle', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'who', 'working', 'something', 'quite', 'big-', 'pair', 'telepods', 'allow', 'instant', 'teleportation', 'film', 'inviting', 'lovely', 'Vernonica', 'Quaife', 'Geena', 'Davis', 'back', 'apartment/', 'lab', 'see', 'what', 'been', 'working', 'amazed', 'what', 'two', 'decide', 'will', 'follow', 'write', 'book', 'invention', 'long', 'two', 'fall', 'love', 'boss', 'John', 'Getz', 'extremely', 'jealous', 'beginning', 'intriguing', 'love', 'triangle', 'meantime', 'something', 'went', 'wrong', 'when', 'Seth', 'Brundlefly', 'teleported', 'first', 'time', 'Something', 'got', 'went', 'undetected', 'causing', 'genetic', 'splicing', 'housefly', 'thereon', 'things', 'get', 'extremely', 'weird', 'gory', 'can', 'not', 'rave', 'film', 'enough', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'one', 'truly', 'quintessential', 'lead', 'performances', 'role', 'Seth', 'Brundle-', 'nerdy', 'awkward', 'beginnings', 'horrific', 'demise', 'final', 'third', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'anything', 'uninitiated', 'other', 'say', 'superhero', 'movie', 'gone', 'wrong', 'Instead', 'becoming', 'selfless', 'heroic', 'result', 'splicing', 'incident', 'hell-bent', 'self', 'preservation', 'movie', 'been', 'seen', 'allegory', 'everything', 'AIDS', 'heroin', 'addiction.As', 'blu-ray', 'transfer', 'really', 'quite', 'impressive', 'effects', 'look', 'terrific', 'high-definition', 'will', 'not', 'become', 'show-off', 'disc', 'vast', 'improvement', 'previous', 'dvd', 'releases', 'extras', 'are', 'same', 'special', 'dvd', 'edition', 'was', 'released', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'addition', 'new', 'trivia', 'track', 'When', 'consider', 'one', 'extras', '3', 'hour-plus', 'documentary', 'making', 'film', 'no-brainer', 'highly', 'recommend', 'excellent', 'movie', 'wholly', 'decent', 'blu-ray', 'release']",The Fly VHS

I have no qualms in this case saying the remake far outshines the original.A scientist (Goldblum) dedicated to developing ""Telepods"", machines that can transfer any object or living creature from one location to another (part of his motivation for wanting to eliminate the need for conventional vehicles?  He has motion sickness), meets a spunky journalist (Davis) at a corporate party and invites her back to show her his creation.  Problem?  The machines do not react well when attempting to ""transport"" any kind of living creature (they have not yet been tried on a human being for this reason).Romance between the two ensues much to the chagrin of Davis's ex (John Getz, who does fine work as well), and Goldblum is inspired to cure the bug (you'll pardon me using that expression) that kept his machines from being able to transport living matter.In what could be a PSA for ""Don't Drink and Teleport"", Goldblum decides to teleport himself after knocking back a few due to jealously over Davis and her ex's relationship.  Guess what got into his pod with him?This is a standout film for all time, featuring top-caliber performances and Oscar winning make-up and special FX, although if you are looking for mindless gore that won't get to you on any other level, you should look elsewhere.Two-disc set is full of yummy extras, including a commentary by Cronenberg and a documentary that runs longer than the film and features all the major actors and behind the scenes players except for Cronenberg himself.

But this remake was so much better than the original and the acting was so much better that I had no choice but to give this film five stars. But I have to say that after the first time I have seen this film, I was literlly sick to my stomach, but that only goes to show you that the make-up was that amazing. I am not a fan of Jeff Goldblum's, basically because most of the time his acting is kind of dry and dull, even though he can play a pretty good &quot;brainy&quot; character, but I really liked him in this film. Yeah is playing a somewhat dull-brainy-dry part, but he doesn't play it dry.Jeff Goldblum is in the role of Seth Brundle, a scientist who does his experimentations with these two tripods. The process is to put one thing into one tripod and put something else into the other and the two objects or animals transport to the opposite tripod. One night, while doing the experiment on himself, a fly became trapped in the tripod Seth was in. The fly's DNA had mixed with Seth's causing him to become part human, part fly. Geena Davis plays Veronica &quot;Ronnie&quot;, Seth's girlfriend. She begins to witness Seth's gruesome transformation. Then, Ronnie reveals to ex-boyrfriend, Stathis Borans (played by John Getz), that she is pregnant with Seth's child. She decides to go tell Seth, but by then, Seth is in one stage away from becoming a complete human-fly being. She goes in and has a talk with Seth, but after seeing what Seth has become, she decides not to say anything about the baby to Seth. Instead, she finishes the conversation with Seth and runs out to tell Stathis that she wants an abortion. Seth, hearing this from the roof, builds a third tripod and kidnaps Ronnie. With the third tripod, he can put Ronnie in the first, himself in the second, and then Seth, Ronnie, and their unborn child will come out of the third as one. Ronnie wants no parts of it and that is when Seth transforms one last time into the most horrifying, but most disgusting creature this world has ever seen, which leads to a heartbreaking conclusion that will leave you breathless, and also have grabbing a bottle of pepto.Yes, this film is very gruesome, but I really enjoyed it. The acting was unbelievable, the make-up was incredible. What's not to like? The movie even won an Oscar for Outstanding Make-Up Effects.

The Fly however was a blind buy, one of those frequent mentions on great sci-fi movies so I thought well why not and sure enough I found a great film and a surprisingly emotional one at that. It is sci-fi and it's got great makeup but it's also at times touching and even slightly disturbing.Seth Brundle is a non-social scientist working on a scientist that in his own words ""will change the world as we know it"". Meeting with reporter Veronica, he shows her his invention: a teleportation device capable of sending objects from one pod to another. The 2 hit it off romantically and the kink the machine has works but one night while drunk and upset, Seth goes into the teleportation pod, unbeknownest a housefly went in with him. Coming out he finds a greater sex drive and athletic ability. But he keeps changing, where he'll become something else entirely.In probably his best performance so far, certainly his most memorable, Jeff Goldblum is absolutely perfect as the awkward Seth and tragic as the ""Brundlefly"". Geena Davis is well-cast as well and there's not a whole lot of cast members besides certain bit players. The makeup is quite excellent as well being very well-done and grotesque. This is the 80's so it might not have the polish of today but it still comes across anyway.What's handled remarkably well is that it doesn't just become a monster movie solely. There's regret and angst and it gets into the sadness of turning into a fly, or at least loving someone turning into a fly. The ""insect politics"" scene is a good example of this, as well as the end, which I won't spoil but it's touching and tragic at the same time. Besides the whole head exploding thing, I thought Scanners kind of sucked and besides James Woods, I found Videodrome kind of boring. The Fly however is a director coming into his own. Kind of like Peter Jackson doing Heavenly Creatures after a series of gory films.It's certainly one of the better films of the 80's, Cronenberg's best and a sci-fi classic so there's not a whole lot of reasons left to persuade you to buy this.",5,Cronenberg's best by far,1145404800,"04 19, 2006",2006,2245,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'never', 'was', 'big', 'fan', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'films', 'frequent', 'sex', 'T', 'A', 'thought', 'Crash', 'was', 'terrible', 'never', 'liked', 'History', 'Violence', 'Fly', 'however', 'was', 'blind', 'buy', 'one', 'frequent', 'mentions', 'great', 'sci-fi', 'movies', 'thought', 'well', 'why', 'not', 'sure', 'enough', 'found', 'great', 'film', 'surprisingly', 'emotional', 'one', 'sci-fi', 'got', 'great', 'makeup', 'also', 'times', 'touching', 'even', 'slightly', 'disturbing.Seth', 'Brundle', 'non-social', 'scientist', 'working', 'scientist', 'own', 'words', 'will', 'change', 'world', 'know', 'Meeting', 'reporter', 'Veronica', 'invention', 'teleportation', 'device', 'capable', 'sending', 'objects', 'one', 'pod', '2', 'hit', 'off', 'romantically', 'kink', 'machine', 'works', 'one', 'night', 'drunk', 'upset', 'Seth', 'teleportation', 'pod', 'unbeknownest', 'housefly', 'went', 'Coming', 'greater', 'sex', 'drive', 'athletic', 'ability', 'changing', 'where', ""'ll"", 'become', 'something', 'else', 'probably', 'best', 'performance', 'so', 'far', 'certainly', 'most', 'memorable', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'awkward', 'Seth', 'tragic', 'Brundlefly', 'Geena', 'Davis', 'well-cast', 'well', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'cast', 'members', 'certain', 'bit', 'players', 'makeup', 'quite', 'excellent', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'very', 'well-done', 'grotesque', '80', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'polish', 'today', 'still', 'handled', 'remarkably', 'well', ""n't"", 'just', 'become', 'monster', 'movie', 'solely', 'regret', 'angst', 'sadness', 'turning', 'fly', 'least', 'loving', 'someone', 'turning', 'fly', 'insect', 'politics', 'scene', 'good', 'example', 'as', 'well', 'end', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'touching', 'tragic', 'same', 'time', 'whole', 'head', 'exploding', 'thing', 'thought', 'Scanners', 'kind', 'sucked', 'James', 'Woods', 'found', 'Videodrome', 'kind', 'boring', 'Fly', 'however', 'director', 'coming', 'own', 'Kind', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'doing', 'Heavenly', 'Creatures', 'series', 'gory', 'films.It', 'certainly', 'one', 'better', 'films', '80', 'Cronenberg', 'best', 'sci-fi', 'classic', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'reasons', 'left', 'persuade', 'buy']",The Fly VHS
227448,A2DB22MRLKXUT4,6300248135,"Collin O'Donnell ""HAL 9000""","[0, 0]","Gus Van Sant's 1998 film Psycho is an extreme example of the needlessness of Hollywood remakes. Too often are they bereft of their own identity which is a key component for any great and memorable movie. However, there are exceptions, such as David Cronenberg's The Fly, a remake of the 1958 Kurt Neumann film. Cronenberg's outing works because it has a strong plot that is heavily altered from the original and complex visual effects that couldn't possibly be pulled off in the 1950's. On this basis, it was a necessary remake. The story follows scientist Seth Brundle as he works towards creating a teleportation system that allows living matter to pass through unharmed. After successfully teleporting a living baboon, Seth tries it out for himself. Unfortunately, a fly was trapped in the pod with him and their genes were spliced upon reanimation. His transformation into Brundlefly is slow and painful, as is his girlfriend's mental anguish when she discovers she is pregnant with Brundle's child. The story is morbid, twisted, and totally gripping. Although the relationship between Seth and Veronica isn't entirely convincing, it' still enough for the audience to get sucked into the film on an emotional level. Chris Walas, legendary make-up/special effects artist, lends his disturbed brilliance to the look of Brundlefly, probably the film's most memorable aspect. The many stages of fusion are perfectly designed and thought-out for maximum grossness. Walas' work in the last twenty minutes alone are worth the price of admission. Jeff Goldblum as Seth Brundle comes off as a genuine mad scientist. The delivery of his lines and his body language and ticks bring a surprising amount of depth and sympathy to his character. Geena Davis as Veronica is tolerable. She doesn't quite sell the hysteria of her character but she is at least an adequate leading lady. John Getz is funny as the despicable Stathis Borans, Veronica's ex-boyfriend and boss. Tight camerawork from Cronenberg and Mark Irwin and an atmospheric score by Howard Shore shape The Fly into a superb 80's remake of a 50's horror film, to be enjoyed right along with the equally brilliant The Thing by John Carpenter.",5,Cronenberg Madness,1402358400,"06 10, 2014",2014,2192,"['Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', '1998', 'film', 'Psycho', 'extreme', 'example', 'needlessness', 'Hollywood', 'remakes', 'Too', 'often', 'are', 'own', 'identity', 'key', 'component', 'great', 'memorable', 'movie', 'However', 'are', 'exceptions', 'such', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'Fly', 'remake', '1958', 'Kurt', 'Neumann', 'film', 'Cronenberg', 'outing', 'strong', 'plot', 'heavily', 'altered', 'original', 'complex', 'visual', 'effects', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'be', 'pulled', 'off', '1950', 'basis', 'was', 'necessary', 'remake', 'story', 'scientist', 'Seth', 'Brundle', 'towards', 'creating', 'teleportation', 'system', 'living', 'matter', 'pass', 'unharmed', 'successfully', 'teleporting', 'living', 'baboon', 'Seth', 'out', 'Unfortunately', 'fly', 'was', 'trapped', 'pod', 'genes', 'were', 'spliced', 'reanimation', 'transformation', 'Brundlefly', 'slow', 'painful', 'girlfriend', 'mental', 'anguish', 'when', 'pregnant', 'Brundle', 'child', 'story', 'morbid', 'twisted', 'totally', 'gripping', 'relationship', 'Seth', 'Veronica', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'convincing', 'still', 'enough', 'audience', 'get', 'sucked', 'film', 'emotional', 'level', 'Chris', 'Walas', 'legendary', 'make-up/special', 'effects', 'artist', 'disturbed', 'brilliance', 'look', 'Brundlefly', 'probably', 'film', 'most', 'memorable', 'aspect', 'many', 'stages', 'fusion', 'are', 'perfectly', 'designed', 'thought-out', 'maximum', 'grossness', 'Walas', 'work', 'last', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'alone', 'are', 'worth', 'price', 'admission', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'Seth', 'Brundle', 'off', 'genuine', 'mad', 'scientist', 'delivery', 'lines', 'body', 'language', 'ticks', 'bring', 'surprising', 'amount', 'depth', 'sympathy', 'character', 'Geena', 'Davis', 'Veronica', 'tolerable', ""n't"", 'quite', 'sell', 'hysteria', 'character', 'least', 'adequate', 'leading', 'lady', 'John', 'Getz', 'funny', 'despicable', 'Stathis', 'Borans', 'Veronica', 'ex-boyfriend', 'boss', 'Tight', 'camerawork', 'Cronenberg', 'Mark', 'Irwin', 'atmospheric', 'score', 'Howard', 'Shore', 'shape', 'Fly', 'superb', '80', 'remake', '50', 'horror', 'film', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'right', 'equally', 'brilliant', 'Thing', 'John', 'Carpenter']",The Fly VHS

Both movie adaptions of the story (starring David Hedison in 1958 and Jeff Goldblum in 1986) are well done. The first had a more Shakespearian slant as far as tragedy, since the protagonist had a long and loving marriage and a son he doted on. However, it lacked in the science application of melding two entities on a genetic level. The second, in my opinion, nailed the science of a gradual mutation of those entities, but it lacked the tragedy of the first, since the wife and son were now replaced by a girlfriend, which muted the tragedy effect.

When he comes out, he feels like he's on top of the world. But all is not right........a fly gets in with him in the telepod, and he find out the fly has fused with him, and slowly but surely he begins to turn more and more into an insect. Geena Davis is also great as the love interest. &quot;The Fly&quot; is sure to please any sci-fi buff, if you have the stomach to take it.

David Pryor's smart and emotional DVD docu takes almost three hours to cover the story of a ""horrible mess"" of a project that resulted in one of the decade's top films. Pryor had plenty to work with: the tangled tale of the script; Mel Brooks' role as horror producer; the sudden death of the original director's daughter; the wooing of Cronenberg; the real-life romance of stars Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis; and Goldblum's miseries inside the rotting human-fly getup.Cronenberg provides thoughtful and easygoing commentary. Revisiting the film, he was ""really struck by how disturbing and emotional"" it remains. He and other principals on the project see it as a love story, not straight horror. Cronenberg's  direction of the film was partly a reaction to the death of his father, to cancer.""The Fly"" DVD really takes off on disc 2, packed with imaginative and interactive extras. Among the many highlights is the reconstruction of the notorious cat-monkey fusion scene, deleted as too sickening.

In his remake, Cronenberg piles the eye -popping, jaw-dropping, and stomach-churning effects on the top of each other as the body of the unfortunate, mad but brilliant scientist (Jeff Goldblum in the role of his life -I've never seen him better) is hideously distorted and he is losing his humanity turning into the insect of the title.

227467,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,6300248135,General Zombie,"[2, 20]","Alright, it's about time I got around to writing another review that everyone is gonna hate, and where I don't actually say anything.  Good times.'The Fly' is probably the best known Cronenberg film, but I sure as hell don't think it's the best. (In fact, I think it's the weakest I've seen from him apart from maybe 'Shivers', and that's got its incredibly low budget and Cronenberg's relative lack of experience to excuse many of its problems.  And thinking about it a bit more, I think I probably actually do like 'Shivers' slightly more.)  Basically, it's a character study with dull characters, a monster movie where the monster doesn't do much of anything.  Admittedly, I'm biased as I didn't get around to really watching this film until after Jeff Goldblum had grown unbearable due to his playing the same damn role a couple of time in various summer blockbuster times, but he's still pretty damn annoying no matter how you look at it.  And that's just one of the concerns, though probably the biggest.  It's like this: His transformation into a fly isn't really all that interesting in and of itself, having no real rhyme or reason and neither he nor the Geena Davis character are particularly likable.  So basically, in this movie there's stuff happening up on the screen, but I don't care about it. (And, seriously, there really isn't all that much going on on the screen, at least not 'til the very end.)  And frankly, the fx just isn't very cool.  The problem is conceptual rather than in the execution, meaning that the fx is actually well done, but the designs are stupid enough that it doesn't much matter.  So basically, the monster is kind of lame, and the random gross out moments didn't impress me all that much, for the most part.Anyway, the film never quite gets boring, but I sat there pretty much the whole time waiting for it to really get good, and it never happened.  It has got it's moments, however.  When the Goldblum character first really starts to transform is pretty amusing, particularly when he goes out to the bar and breaks the dudes arm and steals his woman, as flies are wont to do.  Also, the part where Geena Davis dreams she gives birth to a big maggot is pretty awesome.  But other than that it's just kinda vaguely interesting.  I get the feeling you're supposed to feel sad at the end, but I didn't much care.  Again, I just didn't find Goldblum or Davis to be terribly sympathetic, so who cares what happens to them.Still worth a rental, I suppose, but my standards are low.  Still, you'd be better off going with 'Videodrome' or 'A History of Violence' or 'Scanners' or 'The Dead Zone' etc.Grade: CP.S.

If his work succeeds, it will revolutionize the transport industry and change the  world forever. He has already succeeded in transporting inorganic objects  and he has ironed out the glitches with organic matter. Now he can test the  machine on himself. Unfortunately, Seth failed to notice the fly that was  in the machine with him...After the experiment, Seth undergoes a  gruesome change. The DNA of the fly has become mixed with his own, causing  him to slowly  mutate into something almost too horrible to describe. He  gains all the charateristics of a fly: tremendous strength, ability to  climb walls, and an insatiable craving for sugar. Seth's girlfriend (Geena  Davis) can only watch in horror as he becomes a hideous monstrosity.Not  only is this film nauseating and graphic, there is  a sense of tragedy too.  If Seth's excitement had not got the better of him, he should have thought  of giving his machine a fail-safe mechanism, so that the machine would not  work if more than one creature was in the booth. You wonder how long the  creature Seth became would have lived for. Flies only live for a few days,  so maybe this creature would have had a short lifespan, which would make  its misery mercifully brief.I think some of the effects were  unnecessarily over the top, but it's a clever story.

To tell you the truth, I wasn't looking forward to seeing it. I thought it would be cheesy and not scary at all. Well, it's not cheesy and isn't scary. So, the horror section label doesn't give it that much justice. Yet, it is more a horror movie than anything else. The fact that it isn't scary doesn't take away from the movie whatsoever.The movie has a nerdy scientist (Jeff Goldblum) trying to impress a reporter (Geena Davis) by showing his new invention. This invention is rather incredible. He has managed to teleport things from one probe ot another. He is now trying to do the same thing with animals and maybe even humans. They both fall in love and become partners as well as lovers. But the scientist tries to go through the teleportation process. It would have worked but a fly went in with him. At first, nothing's wrong. On the contrary, he thinks that he has know obtained super abilities from it. Until he starts changing and goes insane.The development of the scientist is trully brilliantly executed. He is having a good time with his abilities..maybe too good a time. But then he becomes depressed, obsessive and crazy. Jeff Goldblum gives a riveting performance..his best. He plays the role with extreme perfection.Geena Davis also does a nice job. Their relationship is excellently portrayed and shows how much they care for each other. And in the end, this allows the movie to be sad and tragic.The makeup gets an A for effort and brilliance. For 1986, this is trully amazing how they show the different stages of the scientist's transformation. And in the end, his fully transformed body is excellently made. Awesome.Now to my favorite aspect of the movie: the score. Trully brilliant and very powerful..it sets the mood for the movie and is what changes one scene to the next.The arm wrestling scene is so memorable and very cool.The Fly is an outstanding movie for the 80s and still remains today as a must see.",5,"A masterful, classic movie",1132876800,"11 25, 2005",2005,2049,"['Fly', 'classic', 'movie', 'one', 'kind', 'gem', 'rarely', 'come', 'Croenberg', 'piece', 'genius', 'tell', 'truth', 'was', ""n't"", 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'cheesy', 'not', 'scary', 'Well', 'not', 'cheesy', ""n't"", 'scary', 'So', 'horror', 'section', 'label', ""n't"", 'give', 'that', 'much', 'justice', 'more', 'horror', 'movie', 'anything', 'else', 'fact', ""n't"", 'scary', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'movie', 'whatsoever.The', 'movie', 'nerdy', 'scientist', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'trying', 'impress', 'reporter', 'Geena', 'Davis', 'showing', 'new', 'invention', 'invention', 'rather', 'incredible', 'managed', 'teleport', 'things', 'one', 'probe', 'now', 'trying', 'do', 'same', 'thing', 'animals', 'maybe', 'even', 'humans', 'fall', 'love', 'become', 'partners', 'as', 'well', 'lovers', 'scientist', 'tries', 'go', 'teleportation', 'process', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'fly', 'went', 'first', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'contrary', 'know', 'obtained', 'super', 'abilities', 'changing', 'insane.The', 'development', 'scientist', 'trully', 'brilliantly', 'executed', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'abilities..maybe', 'too', 'good', 'time', 'then', 'depressed', 'obsessive', 'crazy', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'riveting', 'performance..his', 'best', 'role', 'extreme', 'perfection.Geena', 'Davis', 'also', 'nice', 'job', 'relationship', 'excellently', 'portrayed', 'how', 'much', 'care', 'other', 'end', 'movie', 'be', 'sad', 'tragic.The', 'makeup', 'A', 'effort', 'brilliance', '1986', 'trully', 'amazing', 'how', 'show', 'different', 'stages', 'scientist', 'transformation', 'end', 'fully', 'transformed', 'body', 'excellently', 'made', 'Awesome.Now', 'favorite', 'aspect', 'movie', 'score', 'Trully', 'brilliant', 'very', 'powerful..it', 'mood', 'movie', 'what', 'one', 'scene', 'next.The', 'arm', 'wrestling', 'scene', 'so', 'memorable', 'very', 'cool.The', 'Fly', 'outstanding', 'movie', '80s', 'still', 'today', 'must', 'see']",The Fly VHS

The main theme is that of the extreme dangers of science, which is in the line of many films by David Cronenberg. The stakes are high : teleportation. Such an invention would make all means of transportation obsolete, hence transform our life completely. The scientist in the film is finally coming to the possibility to teletransport living organisms. So he tries it on himself.But , and this is the second theme, computers are not intelligent, which means they can only solve the tasks they are proposed with the instructions they have received. Here the computer has the mission to teletransport what is in one  pod  to the second  pod , which it does. The accident is that the hero enters the first  pod  along with a fly. Never has the computer been told to differentiate the two organisms, which it does automatically since it analyzes what it has to teletransport, but it has not been told to keep the two organisms apart, so it teletransports the whole load (man + fly) as one unique load and it decides, on its own, to fuse them into one single organism and hence to integrate to DNA and all genetic elements of both organisms into one. It fuses the DNA of the fly into the DNA of the man. The point is that the fly is an insect, hence it is a lot more powerful than the man : insects have a DNA that make them able to survive in extreme conditions. So the fused being sees the DNA of the fly take over the DNA of the man. The man becomes a fly. ...This film was made before our ability to clone living organisms but it deals with the same problem : science, when it tampers with  natural  processes, can produce monsters. What is our responsibility in front of that ? Forbid scientific experimentation, which is impossible because too many interests are at stake ? Impose strict procedures, which is very difficult too because some scientists work in isolated conditions, and some of those strict procedures might make some experimentations impossible, and science is by definition always going beyond limits ? We are doomed to produce monsters and monstrous beings and scenarios. There is no protection against that. That is the lesson that comes out of the film : kill such monsters, kill such beings and destroy such scenarios. But do we have the right to do this ? Can we in any way stop scientific work and progress in the name of a norm that is supposed to be either natural or divine ? The film evades the religious approach, but it is always at the back of our consciousness.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Universities II and IX.",4,Science is a necessary evil,990921600,"05 27, 2001",2001,2597,"['Even', 'film', 'remake', 'masterpiece', 'main', 'theme', 'extreme', 'dangers', 'science', 'line', 'many', 'films', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'stakes', 'are', 'high', 'teleportation', 'invention', 'would', 'make', 'means', 'transportation', 'obsolete', 'hence', 'transform', 'life', 'completely', 'scientist', 'film', 'finally', 'coming', 'possibility', 'teletransport', 'living', 'organisms', 'himself.But', 'second', 'theme', 'computers', 'are', 'not', 'intelligent', 'can', 'only', 'solve', 'tasks', 'are', 'proposed', 'instructions', 'have', 'received', 'Here', 'computer', 'mission', 'teletransport', 'what', 'one', 'pod', 'second', 'pod', 'accident', 'hero', 'first', 'pod', 'fly', 'computer', 'been', 'told', 'differentiate', 'two', 'organisms', 'automatically', 'what', 'teletransport', 'not', 'been', 'told', 'keep', 'two', 'organisms', 'apart', 'whole', 'load', 'man', '+', 'fly', 'one', 'unique', 'load', 'own', 'fuse', 'one', 'single', 'organism', 'hence', 'integrate', 'DNA', 'genetic', 'elements', 'organisms', 'one', 'DNA', 'fly', 'DNA', 'man', 'point', 'fly', 'insect', 'hence', 'lot', 'more', 'powerful', 'man', 'insects', 'have', 'DNA', 'make', 'able', 'survive', 'extreme', 'conditions', 'fused', 'being', 'DNA', 'fly', 'take', 'DNA', 'man', 'man', 'fly', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'ability', 'clone', 'living', 'organisms', 'same', 'problem', 'science', 'when', 'natural', 'processes', 'can', 'produce', 'monsters', 'What', 'responsibility', 'front', 'Forbid', 'scientific', 'experimentation', 'impossible', 'too', 'many', 'interests', 'are', 'stake', 'Impose', 'strict', 'procedures', 'very', 'difficult', 'too', 'scientists', 'work', 'isolated', 'conditions', 'strict', 'procedures', 'might', 'make', 'experimentations', 'impossible', 'science', 'definition', 'always', 'going', 'limits', 'are', 'doomed', 'produce', 'monsters', 'monstrous', 'beings', 'scenarios', 'protection', 'lesson', 'film', 'kill', 'such', 'monsters', 'kill', 'such', 'beings', 'destroy', 'such', 'scenarios', 'do', 'have', 'right', 'do', 'Can', 'way', 'stop', 'scientific', 'work', 'progress', 'name', 'norm', 'supposed', 'be', 'either', 'natural', 'divine', 'film', 'religious', 'approach', 'always', 'back', 'consciousness.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'Paris', 'Universities', 'II', 'IX']",The Fly VHS

Now, I appreciate it a great deal more.  Why?  I think there are a number of reasons.  For one, I hold director David Cronenberg's work in high esteem. At age 15, I don't think I was ready for a departure from the norm, a horror film that was artistically surreal as many of his films are.  Now, I'll gladly take something as fresh and innovative as this over the typical Hollywood sci-fi tripe any day.  I also think having an affinity for Kafka's The Metamorphosis doesn't hurt.  After all, that's what this is...a re-telling not just of the original film The Fly but of Kafka's man-turned-insect, becoming even further removed from a xenophobic society than he already was.  This time, the story is told almost through the drug-saturated lens of the 1980s.  That brings me to my final point: the character of Seth Brundle.  Back in my mid-teens, there was no way I could appreciate what it was like to have a job, to struggle for something I really wanted, to fear for those I love that they might be hurt either on accident or on purpose...or worst of all, by me.  In fact, his whole impetus for going through with his teleportation in the first place is to impress a woman, desiring her love.  It's a human tragedy and you really get that coming through from Seth Brundle.  As Brundlefly, he repulses you at every turn, almost bringing up a new and more horrific attribute of his new form (e.g. the vomiting) with each now scene in his slow, downward spiral into flydom.  Jeff Goldblum gives a performance that makes you feel simultaneously disgusted by, angry with, and heartbroken for him all at the same time.  It is overwhelming at times, thought-provoking for the majority of it, and never once does it let your attention wander away from the screen.

This movie isn't for the squeamish but it's a tragic and very interesting movie that will leave you disturbed and it's one of Cronenberg's best.This 2-Disc DVD has excellent picture and sound with awesome extras like audio commentary, three documentaries, alternate ending, deleted scenes, storyboards, script comparisons, rare test footage, the original short story that started it all, Cronenberg's story rewrite, interactive articles from two magazines, promotional featurettes, still galleries, TV Spots, Trailers and Teasers.Also recommended: ""The Brood"", ""Scanners"", ""Videodrome"", ""Dead Ringers"", ""Hulk"", ""The Thing (1982)"", ""An American Werewolf in London"", ""Event Horizon"", ""Aliens"", ""Alien"", ""Re-Animator"", ""The Fly (1958)"", ""Return of the Fly"", ""Son of the Fly"", ""Fly II"", ""Curse of the Fly"", ""Akira"", ""Altered States"", ""The Beast Within"", ""Sick Girl (Masters of Horror)"", ""Slither"", ""Shivers"", ""Wicked City (Anime)"", ""Riki-Oh: The Story of Ricky"", ""Frankenstein (1931)"", ""Mary Shelly's Frankenstein"", ""Day of the Dead"", ""Dawn of the Dead (2004)"", ""The Blob (1988)"", ""Them!"", ""It's Alive!"", ""Hostel 1 & 2"", ""Return of the Living Dead 3"", ""Resident Evil Trilogy"", ""The Dead Zone (1983)"", ""Warning Sign"", ""Bride of Re-Animator"", ""Beyond Re-Animator"", ""From Beyond"", ""The Howling"", ""Deadly Friend"", ""Lifeforce"", ""Chopping Mall"", ""Hollow Man"", ""Rabid"", ""Watchers"", ""The Kindred"", ""Night of the Creeps"" and ""C.H.U.D."".",5,One of David Cronenberg's best movies!,1191456000,"10 4, 2007",2007,2455,"['Seth', 'Bundle', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'scientist', 'special', 'teleportation', 'device', 'can', 'teleport', 'molecular', 'structures', 'one', 'day', 'fly', 'accidently', 'machine', 'fuses', 'beautiful', 'jouranlist', 'Geena', 'Davis', 'love', 'notices', 'strange', 'things', 'happening', 'sicker', 'weird', 'looking', 'day', 'was', 'decaying', 'actually', 'mutating', 'weird', 'fly-like', 'creature.A', 'powerful', 'horrifying', 'sci-fi', 'horror', 'shock-feast', 'Canadian', 'sci-fi', 'terror', 'mastermind', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'excellent', 'remake', '1958', 'horror', 'classic', 'same', 'name', 'almost', 'original', 'way', 'film', 'melodrama', 'mixed', 'disgustingness', 'gore', 'added', 'make-up', 'effects', 'Chris', 'Walas', 'are', 'stomach', 'churning', 'time', 'still', 'are', 'effective', 'especially', 'vomiting', 'doughnuts', 'scene', 'terrific', 'acting', 'cast', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'excellent', 'cameo', 'really', 'horrific', 'nightmare', 'sequence', 'will', 'have', 'squirm', 'movie', ""n't"", 'squeamish', 'tragic', 'very', 'interesting', 'movie', 'will', 'leave', 'disturbed', 'one', 'Cronenberg', 'best.This', '2-Disc', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'picture', 'sound', 'awesome', 'extras', 'audio', 'commentary', 'three', 'documentaries', 'alternate', 'ending', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'storyboards', 'script', 'comparisons', 'rare', 'test', 'footage', 'original', 'short', 'story', 'started', 'Cronenberg', 'story', 'rewrite', 'interactive', 'articles', 'two', 'magazines', 'promotional', 'featurettes', 'still', 'galleries', 'TV', 'Spots', 'Trailers', 'Teasers.Also', 'recommended', 'Brood', 'Scanners', 'Videodrome', 'Dead', 'Ringers', 'Hulk', 'Thing', '1982', 'American', 'Werewolf', 'London', 'Event', 'Horizon', 'Aliens', 'Alien', 'Re-Animator', 'Fly', '1958', 'Return', 'Fly', 'Son', 'Fly', 'Fly', 'II', 'Curse', 'Fly', 'Akira', 'Altered', 'States', 'Beast', 'Within', 'Sick', 'Girl', 'Masters', 'Horror', 'Slither', 'Shivers', 'Wicked', 'City', 'Anime', 'Riki-Oh', 'Story', 'Ricky', 'Frankenstein', '1931', 'Mary', 'Shelly', 'Frankenstein', 'Day', 'Dead', 'Dawn', 'Dead', '2004', 'Blob', '1988', 'Them', 'Alive', 'Hostel', '1', '2', 'Return', 'Living', 'Dead', '3', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'Trilogy', 'Dead', 'Zone', '1983', 'Warning', 'Sign', 'Re-Animator', 'Re-Animator', 'Beyond', 'Howling', 'Deadly', 'Friend', 'Lifeforce', 'Chopping', 'Mall', 'Hollow', 'Man', 'Rabid', 'Watchers', 'Kindred', 'Night', 'Creeps', 'C.H.U.D']",The Fly VHS

227493,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,6300248135,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","I am absolutely thrilled with the deluxe treatment that his fine film has received. Even though, on the surface, ""The Fly"" is a gory and fun horror film--I have long considered it an IMPORTANT masterpiece as well as one of the greatest love stories of the 80's. Anyone familiar with Cronenberg, the film's director, knows that his work can be challenging, avant garde, controversial, weird, gross, and brilliant--usually all of the above.""Dead Ringers"", ""Naked Lunch"", ""Crash"" and ""A History of Violence"" are all exceptional works from someone that defies expectations and makes the films he wants! A true genius, even his more minor works are better than most Hollywood product. ""The Fly"" is a relatively accessible work for Cronenberg, one that is easily enjoyed by a mass audience. Simply put, it's a horror story of science and nature gone awry. It is quite scary, quite gross, quite enjoyable.What distinguishes the film, firstly, are the performances. Jeff Goldblum has never been better, in a different world he would have gotten an Oscar nomination. And Geena Davis is perfect--quirky at the beginning, but grounding the film with a real emotional resonance by the end. I believe that their interaction, their relationship, is a phenomenal love story! How much are you willing to sacrifice when the person you love is literally falling apart? How long can you support them when their actions become insupportable. These are real people, and even though the situation is fantastical, you will really feel for them.What is also important about the film is the context of the time in which it was released. ""The Fly"" is seen by many to be an allegory about AIDS. In 1986, major studios were not making films on this subject. It would be a while before mainstream cinema got around to really addressing the issue. Yet here was ""The Fly"", a mainstream horror movie about illness. The graphic degeneration of a body that has betrayed. It's not hard to see the symbolism in many of the issues and images, and Cronenberg is a master of subtext.But I don't necessarily want to politicize the film, just something to think about if you haven't contemplated it before. Either way, the impact of the film hasn't lessened for me--especially the romance. And please don't think that ""The Fly 2"" has anything to do with this brilliant movie!

It is, of course, a remake of the 1958 &quot;The Fly&quot;, which itself has  stood up very well.  This 1986 remake, however, is a much more  sophisticated and better written undertaking all the way around.  Advancement in film technology and special effects have been formidable  since 1958, and this film provides spectacular proof of it.  The plot, as  before, deals with a young scientist who experiments with genetic  transformation ---- with grotesque and ghastly results.  To watch Jeff  Goldblum metamorphisize into a fly during the course of this film is  fascinating, sometimes repugnant, and always convicing.  Goldblum does a  terrific job as the ill-fated scientist, and his transformation, while  sometimes difficult and unsettling to watch, is nevertheless wonderfully  human.  Geena Davis is no less impressive.  As his helper, love interest,  and ultimately, his source of merciful deliverance, she brings great  strength and poignancy to a role which could have gone for nothing.  This  is decidedly not a film for the squeamish ---- some of the footage,  especially near the end of the film, are pretty graphic and frightening,  but if you can countenance this, you will certainly find yourself moved by  a film which could scarcely have been improved upon.",5,A GREAT AND MOVING HORROR FILM,944265600,"12 4, 1999",1999,1423,"['do', 'not', 'usually', 'horror', 'films', 'one', 'so', 'absorbing', 'well', 'done', 'find', 'returning', 'least', 'once', 'six', 'months', 'course', 'remake', '1958', 'quot', 'Fly', 'quot', 'stood', 'up', 'very', 'well', '1986', 'remake', 'however', 'much', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'better', 'written', 'undertaking', 'way', 'Advancement', 'film', 'technology', 'special', 'effects', 'have', 'been', 'formidable', '1958', 'film', 'spectacular', 'proof', 'plot', 'before', 'deals', 'young', 'scientist', 'who', 'genetic', 'transformation', 'grotesque', 'ghastly', 'results', 'watch', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'metamorphisize', 'fly', 'course', 'film', 'fascinating', 'sometimes', 'repugnant', 'always', 'convicing', 'Goldblum', 'terrific', 'job', 'ill-fated', 'scientist', 'transformation', 'sometimes', 'difficult', 'unsettling', 'watch', 'nevertheless', 'wonderfully', 'human', 'Geena', 'Davis', 'less', 'impressive', 'helper', 'love', 'interest', 'ultimately', 'source', 'merciful', 'deliverance', 'great', 'strength', 'poignancy', 'role', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'nothing', 'decidedly', 'not', 'film', 'squeamish', 'footage', 'especially', 'end', 'film', 'are', 'pretty', 'graphic', 'frightening', 'can', 'countenance', 'will', 'certainly', 'find', 'moved', 'film', 'could', 'scarcely', 'have', 'been', 'improved']",The Fly VHS
227498,AYMZTWBG0V53W,6300248135,"Leslie Karen Rigsbey ""Leslie Rigsbey""","[1, 1]","When I was small, I had nightmares about Brundlefly jumping through the window and kidnapping me. This movie is still truly disturbing after all these years, and this is Cronenberg's genius here--he knew how to make horror disturbing (something that even the most graphic of thrillers today have forgotten how to do effectively). Also, the film has an excellent idea of how to incorporate science fiction and fantastic elements into a script that works--a story that is set in reality but has one particular element in it that could only have escaped from someone's fantastic nightmare. I find the film moving, and Goldblum's performance overlooked even today, and yet most people only remember the disgusting parts. If there is a criticism of Cronenberg's enterprise, it is that his film feels and looks cold, from the 1980s modern d&eacute;cor of Veronica's apartment/office areas, to Seth's dirty, grunge-tinged warehouse/apartment. This device is effective, but it is also draining--&#34;The Fly&#34; is too brisk, too concerned with its cold science, to ever really get into the characters deeply enough or to present us with a story that provides criticism of a world view that posits scientific fact above everything else in life. However, this movie is still unforgettable, and since it's a childhood favorite, I can do nothing but love it.As for the DVD presentation, this one is a keeper. The audio/visual layout on the first disc is fine, with the aspect ratio correctly transferred and the Cronenberg audio commentary worth your ears (at least once, c'mon people!). The sound is fine as well. Also, the second disc is worth your time if you are a nerd about sf/horror films like I am. The documentary about the making of the film is cool, and you get the great Brundlefly natural history museum piece which I find interesting (but, again, I am a nerd). If you are looking for the AMC documentary &#34;The Fly Papers,&#34; you will need to seek out the special edition DVD of &#34;The Fly II&#34;, but other than that every great piece on this film is included on this second disc.Overall, if you are a fan of the film, get this edition. I have not seen the film on BluRay, but I cannot imagine it adding much to the experience. These were the days of puppetry (which I still miss greatly), NOT CGI crap, so you (if you are a young person) might be disappointed with the special effects. But of course this is a love story. The reason not everyone can respond to it is because it is a Cronenberg love story, where the world is a colder place, and where (without syrup) we watch a loved one disintegrate and die of cancer (in effect) before our very eyes. This is Cronenberg's version of a Hollywood love story. Yet, for all of that, it remains a science fiction classic for a reason.

I watched the classic original on tv when I was a mere tadpole, and for the next ten years my brother could have me in tears with the mere words ""Heeeeeeelp meeeeeee!"" Sure, it was a bit corny in the special effects, but it had real horror, real relationships, real reactions. This remake, on the other hand, goes all out in the gross department, mostly centered around the Fly's regurgitating on various proteins so he can then consume them and various bits of his body dropping off at inopportune moments. They aren't so much horrifying as they are nauseating, but that's not the real failure here. The real failure is in the lack of any sincerity in the relationships that are portrayed in the film.For some odd reason, they tried to make this a love story. Well, they failed there as well, because there are no real reactions here. The scene that best sums up the improbability factor is one in which Davis's character gets her first real look at the transitionary monster Goldblum's character has turned into. Upon tenderly reaching up to cradle his face in her hand, she winds up with his ear in her palm. With lukewarm reaction to this rather shocking event, she then goes on to press her cheek to the space where the ear had been. Now I know what it is to love someone, and if my husband's ear popped off in my hand, I would likely not go screaming into the street, but you can bet I'd drop that sucker and perform the dance of ""ew ew ew"" to the other side of the room, and I certainly wouldn't go nuzzling the spot where it had been two minutes later. My suspension of disbelief only goes so far. I really cannot buy the relationship I'm handed without seeing this woman popping two handfuls of valium before she heads in to check on her boyfriend.

Matsunaga ""karma""","[1, 1]","Though I saw this film on VHS when it first came available, I noted then, that it was the first film since ""Alien"" to get under my skin (very uncomfortably, I might add). This was not the first Cronenberg film I had seen, but the fact that he directed it with his trademark weirdness made it all the more effective. The original ""The Fly"" was a pasty bit of horror obviously dated by the time I first saw it. Though it was a good film, it lacked that certain element that this new version displays in spades! It departs from the original film fairly early on, but for good reason. We see first-hand the dangers of messing around withMother Nature""!Jeff Goldblum as Brundle, is a geek who works for a company at the forefront of scientific discovery. He has recently built a device that will make obsolete any and all present transportation systems. Geena Davis plays a reporter of a science magazine assigned to cover a convention dealing with scientific breakthroughs.After meeting, ol' Jeff's hormones are overtaking his reason, and invites Geena to his ""abode"", which is not much more than warehouse space! He shows his new invention to Geena, who promptly reports it to her Editor. While he gets to know her better, he is wary of her involvement with her magazine, so makes a deal with her. For exclusivity, she tells NO one about his invention.Jealousy rears it's ugly head, and Brundle, in a fit of drunken confusion, decides to give the device it's first ""human trial"" (the previous trials ended in rather horrifying fashion). It's successful! There's only one problem....You guessed it, a fly was with him during the trial!All appears well, at first, but as time passes, Brundle begins his ""transformation"". In Cronenberg fashion, we are witness to what has to be the most disgusting mutation in all of film history!! Even after all these years, I have found no other film that tops it!Though the Hedison/Price version of ""The Fly"" was a very good film from the 50's era, this version is vastly superior. There was a sequel, which dealt with Brundle's son, which was O.K., but a bit inferior to this film.

227504,A2M1N8G4W4END8,6300248135,Michael R Gates,"[4, 8]","Arguably David Cronenberg's magnum opus, 1986's THE FLY is a remake of the classic 1958 Vincent Price vehicle that updates the story to reflect current advances in genetics, chemistry, and computer technology.  So the story of a physicist who is merged with a common housefly is more scientifically plausible, but that's really not Cronenberg's motivation for shooting this remake.  In most of his films, Cronenberg shows a fascination with psychological metamorphosis, especially that of an individual who makes a 360-degree change, and THE FLY is no exception.  Here, Cronenberg concentrates on the changes--physical, to be sure, but more importantly the intellectual and emotional--that a hapless scientist suffers as insect DNA slowly encroaches upon his human identity.Cronenberg's film has often been likened to Kafka's THE METAMORPHOSIS, a story in which a man changes into a cockroach.  In some ways the two are similar, but whereas Kafka's tale is a satirical metaphor of individuals who sacrifice their identity and independence for the sake of their family or for the good of society, Cronenberg's opus is instead an allegory that reflects the effects, both personal and social, a debilitating or fatal disease.  For this reason, the film is more raw and primal, exploiting the common human fears of incurable illness, aging, and other physical malfunctions.  And as fans of the director's signature already know, Cronenberg underscores his message with plenty of gallows humor and lots of well-executed and gory FX.The acting in THE FLY is also top-notch and helps to keep the audience engaged in Cronenberg's study of disease-induced decay.  Jeff Goldblum delivers an excellent performance as nerdy Seth Brundle, the unfortunate morphing scientist, and Geena Davis runs the gamut of human emotions portraying Brundle's journalist girlfriend, who watches helplessly as her boyfriend literally goes buggy.  John Getz also does a great turn as Davis' smarmy editor and former lover.The new two-disc DVD from Fox is much better than the previous digital release.  The digital transfer is cleaner and crisper, primarily due to a higher bit rate, and a commentary by director Cronenberg himself is included.  While it does not come paired with the Chris Walas-directed sequel as it did before, it does come with a second disc that is chockfull of cool extras, including some deleted and extended scenes, an alternate ending (actually a coda of sorts that, fortunately, was dumped during the post-production process), and a few interesting documentaries.

227508,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,6300248135,Monty Moonlight,"[1, 1]","No doubt, you've heard that classic line before in other films. Well, this is the legendary sci-fi/horror film they are referencing every time they utter those menacing words. Believe it or not, 1986's David Cronenberg film, ""The Fly"", is both a masterpiece and a remake at the same time, and here's the story:Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) is a scientist working on a world-changing invention. He has developed a working teleportation system! With two intimidating telepods connected to a high-tech computer, Seth can send objects from one pod to the other by teleportation, but his crux is the human issue. Flesh in general, actually, which only confuses the computer thus far. Enter journalist Veronica Quaife (Geena Davis), who gets involved with both Brundle's invention story and Brundle himself. It's this love story between Seth and Veronica that is the strength of the picture, no small part being the unwelcome third party of Veronica's ex-boyfriend/boss, the insufferable Stathis Borans (John Getz). However, the core of the film is Brundle's transformation story, an allegory for aging, disease, and death. You see, as Seth and Veronica's relationship blooms, his project's development seemingly benefiting, a wrench is thrown into the gears in the form of a tiny insect. An otherwise harmless housefly just happens to fly into one of Seth's telepods as he decides to test it out on himself, and the confused computer ends up merging the two, sending Seth into a downward spiral of physical and mental decay and distortion that at times is more than a little difficult to watch. And you can imagine how hard it must be for Veronica, who soon discovers she is carrying Seth's potentially affected offspring.Remakes and sequels are rampant these days, with the big Hollywood studios only wanting to take a chance on films that should guarantee some solid returns, and a lot of film fans seem to be more than a little put out about it. Granted, they can feel very uninspired, and many such films, especially the remakes, aren't worth the price of a ticket when you could probably own the usually superior originals for just as much. However, there probably aren't many better cases for the ""remake"" than Cronenberg's take on ""The Fly"". The first film version came out in 1958 and spawned a couple of sequels. It definitely had its cheese factor, but myself and many others still enjoy it today. It was bizarre, but very entertaining (as the bizarre often is). The remake takes the same basic premise of a scientist getting into his teleportation pod with an unnoticed fly and coming out in a bad way for it. However, at the same time, it is so very different and adds so much to the story. It's so much more than just an update. As I mentioned before, and as the director points out often in his commentary on this blu-ray disc, the film is largely two things: A tragic love story and an allegory of aging and death. In fact, it wasn't intended so much to be about disease, but the heightened fear of the AIDS virus at the time of the film's release certainly made it seem that way, especially considering the make-up effects used on Jeff Goldblum throughout that did take disease into account as an inspiration. Anyway, this combined romance story and personal disintegration story is so masterfully presented in ""The Fly"" that it is without a doubt one of the most unforgettable films you'll ever watch! The Oscar winning effects are high on the gross-out meter, but nothing about this film is over-the-top (deleted scenes aside), unless you count a very disturbing childbirth dream sequence. The troubling thing about The Fly is just how realistic it all is, and it IS downright horrifying. Actually, if I had one gripe about this film, it's that I do wish the final incarnation of Brundlefly looked a wee bit more like a fly, though Cronenberg insists that he wanted it to keep the ability to convey emotion. I still think body language could have said enough and Seth should have turned out even more fly-like, but it doesn't affect the movie's excellence and it remains a masterpiece to me.The performances in ""The Fly"" (the cast is very small) are outstanding. Of course, Jeff Goldblum always is a treat to watch. The writing at times is sheer poetry. The music is excellent and I already mentioned the Academy honored effects. This is one of those sci-fi/horror films that really does the genre a service by going all the way as a work of storytelling art. The Blu-Ray is no slouch either. The film looks and sounds better than ever and there is a wealth of bonus features, including a very lengthy making-of featurette and a director commentary. There are also galleries, a fly swatting game, and pop up trivia, though the pop up trivia isn't really worthwhile if you listen to the commentary and watch the making-of. Trailers, at least one Easter Egg, and other bonus features are also included. I didn't really understand the Personal Scene Selections feature or how it was different from the regular Scene Selection. Over all though, a very impressive and highly affordable Blu-Ray release I definitely recommend. Sci-Fi horror fan or not, if you are trying to build a genre transcending library of the best films ever, you've got to have a space somewhere for Cronenberg's ""The Fly"".",5,"""Be Afraid, Be Very

His affair with the reporter who enters his life to document his discoveries awakens him to the power of the flesh -- but the flesh is nothing if not unpredictable and irrational and a ""fly in the ointment"" changes the outcome of a pivotal experiment, leading to disastrous concequences.  The Fly represents a perfect blend of Cronenberg's b-horror sensibility and his obsession with the overlap between man and machine, flesh and technology.  It takes what might have been a fairly campy remake of a fairly campy horror film and elevates it to a whole new level, giving it an intriguing science fiction premise and a horrific conclusion.  Jeff Goldblum gives a brilliant performance, among his best, as a cerebral scientist who is gradually overcome by the flesh in the form of libidinal urges.  The special effects are just right -- not enough to overwhelm the story, but sufficiently convincing to horrify.  I saw this with a large group very recently, many of whom had never seen it before, and there were uncomfortable laughs and gasps in all the right places.  What is even better, as we talked about the film afterwards there was a lot to say.

Jeff Goldblum stars as a brilliant scientist whose experiment goes awfully awry, and soon enough he is transforming into a an insect-like creature; much to the horror of an investigative journalist (Geena Davis) who he has been romancing, and who is also carrying his child.  Like many of Cronenberg's other films, The Fly is a grisly allegory disguised as a horror film that's hard not to forget.  Goldblum gives what very well may be the best performance of his entire career, and David is excellent as well.  The makeup effects are brilliantly realized as well, with plenty of skin crawling and horiffic moments peppered throughout the film.  This Two-Disc Special Edition features an excellent commentary from Cronenberg, as well as various production diaries as well that are quite insightful.

I remember being disappointed because Vincent Price played a nice guy, and also because the rubber fly head was cheesy even by 1950s standards. Also, I kept wanting to yell at the screen ""If he's got the fly's head, he's got a fly's brain so how can he write stuff?""David Cronenberg's remake is lots better, even though the basic ""science"" is just as silly (even if the fly ""fused"" with Seth Brundle in transit, there wouldn't be enough fly DNA to take over Seth's body, nor would fly DNA be likely to bond with human DNA). Basically, Cronenberg does ""Love Story"" by way of Frankenstein: nerdy scientist meets hot reporter, they fall in love, he messes with nature and becomes a 185 pound fly. Because Cronenberg underplays and maintains a naturalistic style, it all works.When you get quirky Jeff Goldblum and quirky Geena Davis (who were lovers when they made the movie) as the couple, you get quirkiness cubed, and the cuteness factor actually helps, since you like these weirdly self-absorbed characters. John Getz as the third side of the love triangle plays it straight, grounding the feyness of the other two. Carol Spiers' gorgeously lit and claustrophobic sets create the mood, and the gooey, lumpy, disintegrating body parts created by Chris Walas (who designed the Gremlins) provide the horror. And the most wonderful thing of all is that the film runs 95 minutes! Cronenberg did not feel the need of every director these days to bloat a story into a two and a half hour torment.The second disk on the DVD has a making of documentary that runs longer than the movie! Oddly, Cronenberg does the commentary track (which is absorbing and informative) but doesn't do any interviews. Some of the doc is interesting, but I didn't feel the need to spend so much time with the wounded ego of the original writer whose screenplay was rejected, and I didn't need quite so many minutes of on the set hijinks. But how the makeup was created (especially the fly vomit) and how they made Goldblum walk on the ceiling were definitely worth seeing. One weird thing for me: Goldblum on the interviews has a crewcut and reminded me so much of the late Tony Randall (Felix in The Odd Couple on TV) that it was freaky.Anyway, this is a taut, emotionally satisfying, beautifully constructed movie.

It's better and more enjoyable than the original and is an impressive film made way back in 1986. The story is fairly simple. Seth Brundle is a Scientist who is working on the &quot;Greatest Invention In The History Of Mankind&quot;. It's a teleprotation device that can easily and instantly take you to wherever you wanted without having to take a Cab, Plane, Helicopter, and so on. He tests it on a few objects (a meat steak and stocking) and they work fine. However, when he tries it on a Baboon, things turn a little &quot;Inside Out&quot;. He tests it on himself and it works perfectly. So he thinks, because a common HouseFly very stealhly snuck  in the pod with him and merged it's DNA with Brundle's.  The result: Half-Man, Half-Fly, Total Terror. Brundle soon transforms into the monsterous BrundleFly. For a re-make this is pretty damn good. It packs terrific special F/X and they won an Oscar. They deserve every once of that Oscar. The frightening BrundleFly, acidic Fly Vomit, burnt body  parts, disappearing bodies. The acting is also great. Goldblum delivers what is quite possibly his best performance in his career (next to his role in the original Jurassic Park). Cronenberg's direction is very top-notch as well. The music is also superb and the cinematography is wonderful and downright mind-blowing. The best part of The Fly is easily the intense finale. I won't spoil it for you, but it'll scare you stiff. This is all in all a superb re-make of a good film that's better and more enjoyable. I would've given it five stars if it moved at a faster and better pace and the ending wasn't so inconclusive. Check it out when you get the chance (but DON'T watch the TV-ized version).The DVD is VERY bare-boned though. All there is is a Theatrical Trailer, a few production notes, and that's pretty much it. However, it does have a very crisp picture and excellent sound.PS: be SURE you have a strong and empty stomach before watching!",4,Good Re-Make,972086400,"10 21, 2000",2000,2028,"['Fly', '1986', 're-make', '1958', 'Sci-Fi/Horror', 'classic', 'same', 'name', 'better', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'original', 'impressive', 'film', 'made', 'way', 'back', '1986', 'story', 'fairly', 'simple', 'Seth', 'Brundle', 'Scientist', 'who', 'working', 'quot', 'Greatest', 'Invention', 'History', 'Mankind', 'quot', 'teleprotation', 'device', 'can', 'easily', 'instantly', 'take', 'wherever', 'wanted', 'having', 'take', 'Cab', 'Plane', 'Helicopter', 'so', 'few', 'objects', 'meat', 'steak', 'stocking', 'work', 'fine', 'However', 'when', 'Baboon', 'things', 'turn', 'little', 'quot', 'Inside', 'Out', 'quot', 'perfectly', 'common', 'HouseFly', 'very', 'stealhly', 'snuck', 'pod', 'merged', 'DNA', 'Brundle', 'result', 'Half-Man', 'Half-Fly', 'Total', 'Terror', 'Brundle', 'soon', 'monsterous', 'BrundleFly', 're-make', 'pretty', 'damn', 'good', 'terrific', 'special', 'F/X', 'won', 'Oscar', 'deserve', 'once', 'Oscar', 'frightening', 'BrundleFly', 'acidic', 'Fly', 'Vomit', 'body', 'parts', 'disappearing', 'bodies', 'acting', 'also', 'great', 'Goldblum', 'what', 'quite', 'possibly', 'best', 'performance', 'career', 'next', 'role', 'original', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'Cronenberg', 'direction', 'very', 'top-notch', 'well', 'music', 'also', 'superb', 'cinematography', 'wonderful', 'downright', 'mind-blowing', 'best', 'part', 'Fly', 'easily', 'intense', 'finale', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', ""'ll"", 'scare', 'stiff', 'superb', 're-make', 'good', 'film', 'better', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'would', ""'ve"", 'given', 'five', 'stars', 'moved', 'faster', 'better', 'pace', 'ending', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'inconclusive', 'Check', 'out', 'when', 'get', 'chance', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'watch', 'TV-ized', 'version', '.The', 'DVD', 'VERY', 'bare-boned', 'Theatrical', 'Trailer', 'few', 'production', 'notes', 'pretty', 'much', 'However', 'have', 'very', 'crisp', 'picture', 'excellent', 'sound.PS', 'be', 'SURE', 'have', 'strong', 'empty', 'stomach', 'watching']",The Fly VHS

I am going to be honest and tell you that I saw The Fly in theaters when it first came out and I had not seen it again until recently when I bought the Blu Ray from Amazon.com for $8.49 on gold box deal. I love science fiction and I think the story is a timeless classic about a man who turns to a monster, in this film, as result of an accident during a scientific experiment.It is a very well-made film where all aspects of film making come together to create the intended effect. Visual effects are stunning, specially makeup. I am glad that they did this movie back in 1987 before CGI became the dominant visual effect tool. If this movie were made today, they would probably use CGI to create the monster visuals instead of using makeup and I am afraid it would have lost some of the organic effects which can be created only through makeup. A great horror movie needs a great score and the Fly has a great score portraying the tone of the story perfectly.I am also impressed by the number and the quality of bonus materials and special features. There are several documentaries, when played all, over 2 hours. There are deleted scened, feature commentaries, behind the scenes footages, and many more. Bonus features exceeded my expectations. I own many fantasy-horror movies on Blu ray and many lack quality bonus features.

227530,A9AA6DFHYP7Q3,6300248135,Solo Goodspeed,"[3, 4]","An outstanding example of a remake that surpassed its predecessor, Cronenberg's ""The Fly"" is at once a sci-fi thriller, a grueling gothic horror tale and a tragic romance, with a visceral edge that can still make some viewers cringe and wince. As star Geena Davis observes in the supplement: It's a Cronenberg movie, so you're gonna get a bit wet.In summary: Seth Brundle, a brilliant, isolated researcher, has developed a system that can teleport an object through space by disintegrating it in one spot and reintegrating it in another. ""It'll change the world as we know it,"" he explains to Ronnie the tech journalist, who further rocks his world by falling in love with him in the course of covering his project for her magazine. Problem is, he has not yet been successful in teleporting any living subjects ... without nasty results. Inspired by Ronnie, he reprograms his system to get ""crazy"" enough about flesh to dis/re-integrate life effectively, and is successful at last. Unfortunately (also because of Ronnie, in a fit of jealousy), he briefly abandons rationality one evening and teleports himself.In addition to a newfound surge of near uncontainable energy, Brundle eventually notices a change coming over him; skin discoloration, hair and nails coming loose, and a viscous white fluid discharge all over. He discovers that another organism, an ordinary housefly, was teleported with him and introduced into his genetic makeup, and that he will ultimately transform into some other life form, part insect, part human. The outcome is ultimately horrific as the filmmakers and performers take us through each stage of Brundle's grueling mutation into BrundleFly.That's it in a nutshell. Jeff Goldblum's Oscar-nominated performance as Brundle is unforgettable and (along with Chris Walas' eye-popping effects makeup and prosthetics) is what elevates this 1986 version far beyond Fox's earlier attempt. Director Cronenberg was never one to shy away from gruesomeness in film, and you can almost feel what is happening to Seth as he changes, one thing that makes this film hard to recommend as ""entertainment"". The Blu-Ray HD transfer is outstanding, though maybe not crystal clear 100% of the time, rich and textured and brings this dark tale to ferocious life.The supplement included, ""Fear of the Flesh"", is a full length love letter to fans of this movie, touching on every step of its history from the original director and why Cronenberg wasn't available at first, to a ghastly upbeat alternative ending that was (thank God) scrapped. The Butterfly Baby .... yeesh! An interesting side note is how the gorgeous Geena Davis began her career with her role as Ronnie. There's the rotating room from scenes where Brundle climbs the walls and ceiling. And yes, of course, generous looks at the prosthetics and puppetry that make up The Fly's nightmare final act. It's both the movie and the book of the movie in one package which, again for fans, is well worth owning.This bug has flown a long way since its first appearance as a short story in Playboy in the 50s; in that sense, the mutation has been beautiful indeed.

So that's what happened to Stephen Hawking!)By credo, Researchers are not to use themselves as subjects, because in so doing, objectivity is cast to the wayside. Scientists are like any one else: they want to be right.A Scientific accident occurs and sets forth a most hideous result, as the Researcher takes on the form of a severe lepor. His girlfriend tapes some of the transistion, but clearly becomes ambivalent towards re-entering the nightmarish truth she can see evolving right in front of her. She begins to fear the possibility she's also infected, and begs for her life.One body part after another drops away from his form.

As I've done previously I wish to focus on the quality of the picture and audio and leave the writing of the film review for those better suited to it.This movie is encoded on Blu-Ray using the AVC codec and is brought in using 1080p that most expect from Blu-Ray. The video itself is less than stellar in terms of presentation. Let me qualify this. This is likely the best the movie has EVER looked for home presentation, but it's not a visually impressive movie no matter how it's presented. There is some film grain but there is plenty of detail to be seen. It's just that the movie has no ""pizazz"" to it so to speak. There are no blemishes on the film and no weird compression artifacts at all. This is as it should be for an HD release.The audio is DTS-HD lossless. The problem is that there really isn't much that requires any directionality here. It's mostly dialog driven with not much else going on in the sound field. The thing is, 5.1 audio in a movie like this really isn't needed and I'm glad that Fox didn't try to dress the audio up needlessly. I may sound like a broken record but this is also likely the best The Fly has sounded in the home market.The extras, as seems to be the case on many releases of films that already have DVD editions packed with extras, are all in standard definition. There are some Blu-Ray exclusive extras that aren't particularly noteworthy. The first is pop-up trivia during the film (you can turn this on and off) with fun production facts and so on. The other is a very boring and annoying ""game"" called ""Flyswatter."" You have this slow moving fly flying around the screen with some scenes from the movie playing in the background and the objective is to swat the fly with an even slower moving flyswatter. It's time wasting and really adds nothing of value to the disc.If you already have the special edition SD release, given the video and audio doesn't really stand out too much in the HD front, you may want to think twice about picking up the Blu-Ray edition of The Fly. If you don't own it and want a definitive edition with all the previous extras and the best possible audio and video, look no further.For a back catalog release with limited appeal, I do think the MSRP is a little on the high side however.",4,Decent showing on Blu-Ray,1199923200,"01 10, 2008",2008,2328,"[""'re"", 'looking', 'review', 'film', 'look', 'elsewhere', ""'ve"", 'done', 'previously', 'wish', 'focus', 'quality', 'picture', 'audio', 'leave', 'writing', 'film', 'review', 'better', 'suited', 'it.This', 'movie', 'encoded', 'Blu-Ray', 'using', 'AVC', 'codec', 'brought', 'using', '1080p', 'most', 'expect', 'Blu-Ray', 'video', 'less', 'stellar', 'terms', 'presentation', 'Let', 'qualify', 'likely', 'best', 'movie', 'EVER', 'looked', 'home', 'presentation', 'not', 'visually', 'impressive', 'movie', 'matter', 'how', 'presented', 'film', 'grain', 'plenty', 'detail', 'be', 'seen', 'just', 'movie', 'pizazz', 'so', 'speak', 'are', 'blemishes', 'film', 'weird', 'compression', 'artifacts', 'should', 'be', 'HD', 'release.The', 'audio', 'DTS-HD', 'lossless', 'problem', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'directionality', 'here', 'mostly', 'dialog', 'driven', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'going', 'sound', 'field', 'thing', '5.1', 'audio', 'movie', 'really', ""n't"", 'needed', ""'m"", 'glad', 'Fox', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'dress', 'audio', 'up', 'needlessly', 'may', 'sound', 'broken', 'record', 'also', 'likely', 'best', 'Fly', 'sounded', 'home', 'market.The', 'extras', 'be', 'case', 'many', 'releases', 'films', 'already', 'have', 'DVD', 'editions', 'packed', 'extras', 'are', 'standard', 'definition', 'are', 'Blu-Ray', 'exclusive', 'extras', 'are', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'noteworthy', 'first', 'pop-up', 'trivia', 'film', 'can', 'turn', 'fun', 'production', 'facts', 'so', 'other', 'very', 'boring', 'annoying', 'game', 'called', 'Flyswatter', 'have', 'slow', 'moving', 'fly', 'flying', 'screen', 'scenes', 'movie', 'playing', 'background', 'objective', 'swat', 'fly', 'even', 'slower', 'moving', 'flyswatter', 'time', 'wasting', 'really', 'nothing', 'value', 'disc.If', 'already', 'have', 'special', 'edition', 'SD', 'release', 'given', 'video', 'audio', ""n't"", 'really', 'stand', 'out', 'too', 'much', 'HD', 'front', 'may', 'want', 'think', 'twice', 'about', 'picking', 'up', 'Blu-Ray', 'edition', 'Fly', 'do', ""n't"", 'own', 'want', 'definitive', 'edition', 'previous', 'extras', 'best', 'possible', 'audio', 'video', 'look', 'further.For', 'back', 'catalog', 'release', 'limited', 'appeal', 'do', 'think', 'MSRP', 'little', 'high', 'side', 'however']",The Fly VHS

When will most reviewers stop writing book report summaries of the plot and their opinions of the acting.  If I am interested in buying a blu ray DVD it is because I have already seen the movie and liked it and may already have it on a Standard DVD and want to know of the quality of the BD transfer.For an older movie, the blu ray transfer is not bad at all.  It is not an outstanding transfer but one that really was, for the most part,  free of film grain and artifacting.  The colors of the video transfer do not pop as the movie was shot and its colors were muted in post production editing.  Many dark scenes but they did not hide the details which were pretty sharp to my eyes,  All in all, a pretty decent job.The audio is DTSHD 5.1.  There were some excellent scenes with great use of the discreet channels but, for the most part, this movie is very dialogue driven and the surrounds infrequently needed or used.The only extras, other than commentary, were trailers for other movies, and an annoyingly silly fly swatter game.  I hate buying a movie with advertisements for other films. When Blu Ray first came out the public was promised incredible extras, and, yes, sometimes we get them, but not on this disc.For the $6.00 I paid for this, it was worthwhile to have and a decent transfer to boot, but it will not be your demo disc to show off your system.All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.Thanks",4,'The Fly' on Blu Ray,1343433600,"07 28, 2012",2012,1807,"['When', 'will', 'Amazon', 'ever', 'separate', 'reviews', 'BluRay', 'discs', 'Standard', 'Definition', 'DVDs', 'When', 'will', 'most', 'reviewers', 'stop', 'writing', 'book', 'report', 'summaries', 'plot', 'opinions', 'acting', 'am', 'interested', 'buying', 'blu', 'ray', 'DVD', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'movie', 'liked', 'may', 'already', 'have', 'Standard', 'DVD', 'want', 'know', 'quality', 'BD', 'transfer.For', 'older', 'movie', 'blu', 'ray', 'transfer', 'not', 'bad', 'not', 'outstanding', 'transfer', 'one', 'really', 'was', 'most', 'part', 'free', 'film', 'grain', 'artifacting', 'colors', 'video', 'transfer', 'do', 'not', 'pop', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'colors', 'were', 'muted', 'post', 'production', 'editing', 'Many', 'dark', 'scenes', 'did', 'not', 'hide', 'details', 'were', 'pretty', 'sharp', 'eyes', 'pretty', 'decent', 'job.The', 'audio', 'DTSHD', '5.1', 'were', 'excellent', 'scenes', 'great', 'use', 'discreet', 'channels', 'most', 'part', 'movie', 'very', 'dialogue', 'driven', 'surrounds', 'infrequently', 'needed', 'used.The', 'only', 'extras', 'other', 'commentary', 'were', 'trailers', 'other', 'movies', 'annoyingly', 'silly', 'fly', 'swatter', 'game', 'hate', 'buying', 'movie', 'advertisements', 'other', 'films', 'When', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'public', 'was', 'promised', 'incredible', 'extras', 'yes', 'sometimes', 'get', 'not', '6.00', 'paid', 'was', 'worthwhile', 'have', 'decent', 'transfer', 'boot', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'demo', 'disc', 'show', 'off', 'system.All', 'movie', 'reviews', 'are', 'nature', 'focus', 'only', 'quality', 'transfer', 'BluRay', 'so', 'check', 'see', 'are', 'help', 'well.Hopefully', 'review', 'been', 'help', 'determining', 'purchase', 'hope', 'am', 'correct', 'path', 'review', 'transfer', 'quality', 'opposed', 'providing', 'plot', 'summaries.Thanks']",The Fly VHS

Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis both do their best work here. I like how director David Cronenberg combined a tragic love story with the sci-fi/horror story. The love story gave the film an extra layer of depth that you wouldn't expect from a horror flick. This is one of the few horror films I've seen that is emotionally moving. &quot;Poltergeist&quot; and &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; are other examples. Goldblum gives his character, Seth Brundle, so much humor and pathos that we still care about him even when he transforms slowly into another being.

I have no excuse and neither did I have to reference the Lord of the Rings in doing so but it was the first thing that came to mind so... my apologies.I'm a bit late in singing the praises of this DVD since it came out last year already but as of late, I've been watching this film a lot because of how well produced this DVD is. They really did a good job with this disc and they finally gave the film the treatment it deserves. The picture is nice and clear and the 5.1 mixes (Dolby Digital and DTS) are pretty sweet. So what that translates to is that what was disgusting before in this film is made to be utterly revolting now. Vomiting never looked and sounded so clear before now, especially as it eats through the flesh of a poor guy's hand and foot!This disc is loaded with special features and if they release this down the road with more stuff, I won't believe it. You get a Cronenberg commentary which is nice because his commentaries are always an enjoyable and informative listen. There are great featurettes, interesting deleted scenes, scripts, texts, pictures and a fantastic, lengthy making-of documentary which is worth the price of the disc alone. If I had to complain, I would've liked to see something said about Howard Shore's music for the film but they really don't make any mention of it. It's a very minor complaint and nothing that hurts the disc overall.The Fly is a pretty nasty film and I think on that we can all agree on that. Few movies are as revolting as this one, that's for sure. But underneath the viscera, you have a very intelligent, thoughtful and genuinely moving film that has great performances by Jeff Goldblum in the title role, Geena Davis and John Getz.

Upon arrival at his lab, Brundle shows Veronica his invention - a teleporter that can transport objects from one place to the other in a matter of seconds. Their is a catch, however:""I can only teleport inanimate objects.""""Well, what happens when you teleport living things?""""Not while we're eating.""Seth convinces Veronica not to do an article for the magazine she works for (headed by her ex-beau Stathis Borans), but, instead, write a book about the whole experiment from the early stages to the present. With a current breakthrough, thanks to Veronica, Brundle ""teaches"" the teleporter to understand the complexties of living tissue. Also, a strong romance blossoms between the two.When the breakthrough that Seth needs happens (a successful teleportation of a living animal (in this case a baboon)) it's time to celebrate.But, not if Stathis Barons has anything to say about it. Veronica finds a portfolio with sketches of cover artwork from her magazine with Seth & the teleporter on them. Veronica thinks that Stathis is trying to get back into her good graces & calls off the celebration to deal with Stathis once & for all. Stathis tells Veronica that he did some background checking on Brundle & decided to give him a choice article in an upcoming issue. Basically, if the only way of keeping Veronica in his life is to work with her on a professional basis, then that's what he will do.Seth, celebrating on his own by doing champagne shots, gets a little jealous, as he gets wise to Veronica's romantic past with Stathis.""From ""the desk of Stathis Borans""..., How about ""under the desk of Stathis Borans?""Totally inebriated, Seth apoligizes to his baboon subject for destroying his brother in an earlier experiment & then, recklessly, decides to take the final test - human teleportation, with him as the subject. The experiment is a success - at first...Over the next few days Veronica notices a rapid change in Seth. He gains superhuman like strength, with an increase in his sex drive. Also, odd prickly, hairs start to grow from a cut on his back. Veronica gets a sample & has them analyzed, with the results being that the hairs are insectoid in nature. Short tempered & hyperactively skittish, Seth has Veronica thrown out of his lab & has the book deal terminated. The honeymoon is over.""There was an old lady who swallowed a fly, perhaps she'll die.""Seth does some further investigation of his own &, to his horror, finds out that he wasn't alone in the transmitter pod during the teleportation. A common housefly had made its way in & got trapped inside the pod with him.""The computer got confused... -there wasn't supposed to be two seperate genetic patterns - & it decided to..., uhh... splice us together. It mated us, me & the fly. We hadn't even been properly introduced.""Seth's body gruesomely deteriates & mutates, as he tries to figure out a cure for his cancer before he loses all senses of his humanity & mutates into a monsterous half-breed between Brundle & fly.The 1986 remake of ""The Fly"" is one of those very rare remakes that does the impossible. It surpasses & outdoes it's original.Cronenberg does a great job at directing & this is, argueably, his best film to date. Goldblum, Davis, & John Getz give great performances with Goldblum being the stand-out. Almost anybody can wear the makeup, but, with those fly-like twitches, & the aches & pains of mutation, Goldblum gives ""The Fly"" its much needed buzz.The score is written & composed by Howard Shore & I consider it to be one of the London Symphony Orchestra's underated performances (the Orchestra also performed with John Williams on ""Star Wars"", ""Jaws"", ""Superman"", & ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"").Mel Brooks' movie studio ""Brooksfilms"" was the major backer on the film, with ""Fox"".David Cronenberg was the first choice for director on the project, but, was unavailable at the time trying his hand at directing ""Total Recall"" for Dino DeLaurentis.Robert Bierman was then hired for directing chores. But, when a horrific family tragedy called him back home, Bierman backed out of the film & with Cronenberg having problems of his own with DeLaurentis, Cronenberg easily slid into the director's saddle on ""The Fly"". It's been 20 years since ""The Fly"" went into production &, to this day, Bierman has yet to see the film (he's reminded too much of his daughter's death & the circumstances surrounding it, including this film & his association with it).After an extensive Cronenberg rewrite of Charles Edward Pogue's screenplay, Jeff Goldblum was hired to portray the doomed scientist. Goldblum was dating Geena Davis at the time & she auditioned for the role of Veronica. She was the first one to audition & the producer's sized up her audition with the other actresses who tried out & no one could beat her. She got the role unanimously.Makeup effects master, Chris Walas started make-up preparations for ""The Fly"" when he got a call from Steven Spielberg to work on ""Gremlins 2"". Walas politely declined & his reward was an Oscar in make-up effects for ""The Fly"" (although, I'm not too sure if Walas & Spielberg have ever worked together again on any other project).The opening title shot with the fluttering of green wings that changed into the film's title was actually taken from the coming attractions trailer to the film, after Cronenberg saw it & liked it so much that he used for the opening title shot.The film opened on August 15th 1986. Total box office gross was roughly 40 million dollars (""The Fly"" was released the same weekend as ""Manhunter"" (the Hannibal Lecter film).Audience reaction was mostly the same. Gross! ""People"" magazine dubbed ""The Fly"" as the gross-out movie of the year. I saw ""The Fly"" on opening weekend & people were so grossed out. Especially, the scene when Brundle lends an ear to Veronica, & in return she hugs him on the same side! It was the exact same reaction that Geena Davis describes in the documentary. People were so grossed out that you couldn't here the next three lines of the film. I think one lady left when Brundle-fly finally transforms into the space bug at the end of the film.This new 2 disc DVD edition is awesome. In a world where movie studios take their old films & practically hurl them onto DVD, not caring about quality & prosperity, film wise, it's nice to see a release like this.Disc 1 to ""The Fly"" has the film in the widescreen format with Dolby Digital 5.1 & DTS 5.1 (yes!), with a director's commentary by Cronenberg.Disc 2 has the three production documentaries that can be watched seperatley or viewed in a branching version (easter egg #1: using your DVD remote go to the documentary main page.

Oddly, a very few, such as ""The Godfather, Part II"" and Philip Kaufman's remake of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers,"" are better than the originals. Canadian director David Cronenberg's 1986 remake of the cheapo 1950s horror film ""The Fly"" is now another. Although it isn't the ""masterpiece"" its makers and some critics claim, it surpasses the first film in its science, story plotting, social commentary and sheer moviemaking skill (see the director's 2005 ""A History of Violence"" for evidence of that.)Jeff Goldblum, who also was in the ""Body Snatchers"" remake, plays a nerdy scientist and Geena Davis a reporter who is chronicling his ""telepod"" experiment, one which will change world transportation forever. The actors, who were dating at the time, have real screen chemistry. Their emotional bond is both terrifying and touching when his experiment goes grimly awry.

227544,AQP1VPK16SVWM,6300248135,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[0, 0]","David Cronenberg took the same approach as John Carpenter did with his remake of ""The Thing""; he created a film that is every bit as unique as the original film returning to the themes that interested him. The screenplay by Charles Edward Pogue and Cronenberg focuses on Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldbloom) who creates a device to teleport things but he's failed at teleporting humans. Science writer Ronnie (Gena Davis) chronicles his attempt to figure out why he can't transport humans. He licks the problem and foolishly decides to make himself the first human test subject. When a fly accidently gets into the telepod, the computer combines the DNA of Seth and the fly creating a bizarre hybrid in the process.The blu-ray looks good but not as brilliant as I had hoped. Keep in mind that the source is over 21 years old. The fly does look better than the DVD with a sharper image, better depth and detail but it doesn't look as good as a more recent film. Make no mistake though it IS an improvement but it's incremental not a huge leap.We get all the extras from the previous two disc edition including the excellent documentary on the making of the movie. The new extras here include a swat the fly game (which like the annoying ""Build a Gort"" a game on ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" is a waste of resources). We also get a good trivia track and blu-ray search index. All the other extras including the commentary tracks and featurettes are ported over from the regular DVD.While the Blu-ray transfer here isn't a huge leap compared to the DVD (I suspect the previous high def remaster that was prepared for the DVD reissue forms the basis for this version), it does look better than the DVD. It's a pity that Fox didn't elect to do an upgraded high def transfer but what we do get looks quite good. The film which came out during the beginning of the AIDS epidemic was seen as a metaphor for that outbreak the film manages to touch on a number of common themes in Cronenberg's work. It's a terrific film that manages to be creepy, humorous and touching. I'd give the film five stars, the transfer three and the extras four.",5,"""I'm an insect who dreamt he was a man and loved it.

""The Fly"" also happens to be one of the 20th century's great morality plays.Jeff Goldblum plays physicist Seth Brundle, who is experimenting with teleportation. The fire in his mind for this idea blinds Brundle to the fact that he's playing with fire. His name conveys tragedy. Seth was the third son of Adam and Eve (see Book of Genesis), the one to cover over the tragedy of Cain and Abel. ""The Fly"" teaches that human nature can just as easily lead to destruction in the sons of Seth as it did with Cain. ""Brundle"" is pretty close to ""blunder,"" tipping us to the scientist's eventual downfall. But thinking deeper within the context of the story, we discover an even greater insight, one that the Jewish High Holiday liturgy teaches but we flawed humans seem to forget between one Rosh Hashana and the next - you cannot sin repeatedly and repent. In other words, sin deforms us and it's extremely difficult (for most, impossible) to become whole again. Seth's teleportation pods and the breakdown of his body and mind (superb makeup and special effects) comprise a wonderful parable of this.Despairing about love (caused by not being at peace with the complexities of human relationships) is an easily overlooked but key element in Seth's undoing. On the surface most viewers will realize the wisdom of don't drink and teleport.""The Fly"" is a pro-life movie. Seth's plea to Veronica (Geena Davis) not to have the abortion - ""Please don't kill me"" - is deep pathos and very moving.  Veronica's admirable love for Seth amid worsening circumstances will ring true to all those that have cared for someone through cancer, AIDS, or some other debilitating illness. Figuratively, Veronica grows wings of love and her continuing visits to Seth's lab amid increasing danger and sadness establish the truth of what Beatle George Harrison once taught - ""There's more to it than just these bodies of ours.""Cronenberg expertly builds the horror (Veronica's ""Be afraid, be very afraid"" line works better than a thunder clap) and he doesn't skimp at the end. Broken bodies and wounded spirits are before us as the curtain falls. Masterful from beginning to end is Cronenberg, who personally rewrote Charles Edward Pogue's screenplay. No words necessary to convey the great lesson at the end of ""The Fly,"" just as true today as 25 years ago when the movie was released - sin kills but if we're humble and loving enough G-d gives us wings to rise above.",5,On the wings of love,1328400000,"02 5, 2012",2012,2626,"['David', 'Cronenberg', 'version', 'George', 'Langelaan', 'classic', 'science', 'fiction', 'story', 'second', 'disc', 'loaded', 'special', 'features', 'Fly', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'DVD', 'well', 'owning', 'Fly', 'also', 'be', 'one', '20th', 'century', 'great', 'morality', 'plays.Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'physicist', 'Seth', 'Brundle', 'who', 'experimenting', 'teleportation', 'fire', 'mind', 'idea', 'Brundle', 'fact', 'playing', 'fire', 'name', 'conveys', 'tragedy', 'Seth', 'was', 'third', 'son', 'Adam', 'Eve', 'see', 'Book', 'Genesis', 'one', 'cover', 'tragedy', 'Cain', 'Abel', 'Fly', 'human', 'nature', 'can', 'just', 'easily', 'lead', 'destruction', 'sons', 'Seth', 'did', 'Cain', 'Brundle', 'pretty', 'close', 'blunder', 'tipping', 'scientist', 'eventual', 'downfall', 'thinking', 'deeper', 'context', 'story', 'discover', 'even', 'greater', 'insight', 'one', 'Jewish', 'High', 'Holiday', 'liturgy', 'teaches', 'flawed', 'humans', 'seem', 'forget', 'one', 'Rosh', 'Hashana', 'next', 'can', 'not', 'sin', 'repeatedly', 'repent', 'other', 'words', 'sin', 'deforms', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'most', 'impossible', 'become', 'whole', 'again', 'Seth', 'teleportation', 'pods', 'breakdown', 'body', 'mind', 'superb', 'makeup', 'special', 'effects', 'comprise', 'wonderful', 'parable', 'this.Despairing', 'love', 'caused', 'not', 'being', 'peace', 'complexities', 'human', 'relationships', 'easily', 'overlooked', 'key', 'element', 'Seth', 'undoing', 'surface', 'most', 'viewers', 'will', 'realize', 'wisdom', 'do', ""n't"", 'drink', 'teleport', 'Fly', 'pro-life', 'movie', 'Seth', 'plea', 'Veronica', 'Geena', 'Davis', 'not', 'have', 'abortion', 'Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'kill', 'deep', 'pathos', 'very', 'moving', 'Veronica', 'admirable', 'love', 'Seth', 'worsening', 'circumstances', 'will', 'ring', 'true', 'have', 'cared', 'someone', 'cancer', 'AIDS', 'other', 'debilitating', 'illness', 'Figuratively', 'Veronica', 'wings', 'love', 'continuing', 'visits', 'Seth', 'lab', 'increasing', 'danger', 'sadness', 'establish', 'truth', 'what', 'Beatle', 'George', 'Harrison', 'once', 'taught', 'more', 'just', 'bodies', 'ours', 'Cronenberg', 'expertly', 'horror', 'Veronica', 'Be', 'afraid', 'be', 'very', 'afraid', 'line', 'better', 'thunder', 'clap', ""n't"", 'skimp', 'end', 'Broken', 'bodies', 'wounded', 'spirits', 'are', 'before', 'curtain', 'Masterful', 'beginning', 'end', 'Cronenberg', 'who', 'personally', 'rewrote', 'Charles', 'Edward', 'Pogue', 'screenplay', 'words', 'necessary', 'convey', 'great', 'lesson', 'end', 'Fly', 'just', 'true', 'today', '25', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'sin', 'kills', ""'re"", 'humble', 'loving', 'enough', 'G-d', 'wings', 'rise', 'above']",The Fly VHS
