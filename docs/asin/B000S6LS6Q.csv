1085411,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B000S6LS6Q,Robert I. Hedges,"[22, 23]","""Dirty Jobs"" is perhaps the most entertaining show currently on television. Every week affable host Mike Rowe does a couple of utterly revolting jobs that make civilization possible, yet are mortifyingly unpleasant. ""Collection 1"" features some of the very best episodes from the series, and will make almost everyone grateful that they do what they do for a living.While all the episodes are great, there are a few that are absolutely extraordinary.""Monkey Caretaker"" is one of the most famous episodes. It turns out that monkeys can be extremely difficult to deal with, and so can the caretaker. In the end several injuries ensue, including an especially nasty bite to the sound man's leg.""Ostrich Rancher"" is extraordinary, if for no other reason than seeing Mike trying to put a sock over an angry ostrich's head.""Alpaca Shearer"" is one of my favorite episodes. It is actually one of the cleaner jobs (if you can deal with the high-velocity alpaca spit), but the conclusion is one of the most priceless pieces of television genius I have ever seen. (I'm not going to spoil it for you!)""Shark Patroller"" is from the special ""Jobs That Bite."" While that episode is actually one of my least favorites overall, the concept of jumping in the ocean with a bunch of freshly-chummed sharks to test a new shark repellant is amazing. I wasn't wild about the shark autopsy: I had to dissect a shark in an upper level biology lab in college, and this brought back several unpleasant memories for me. It's also really the only thing I would say was not suitable for small children on the disc.""Fuel Tank Cleaner"" gives any viewer a new-found respect both for aircraft mechanics and the real meaning of claustrophobia.""Disaster Cleaner Upper"" is my second favorite episode, and features the efforts of a valiant team to recover a basement from the effects of a demonically possessed toilet which dumped the contents of the entire neighborhood's sewer lines into an unsuspecting house. This one grossed me out, especially the use of the garden trowel.""Casino Food Recycler"" is, hands down, my favorite episode of the series so far. A kindly and funny old farmer in Las Vegas recycles food scraps to raise pigs on. The totally novel operation is at once amazing and disgusting, but undeniably ecologically sensible.Throughout each of these Mike is good-natured, intelligent, and helpful. Well, at least as helpful as he can be. I will give him one thing: there is absolutely nothing he won't do, and I admire that greatly, as some of them I know I would not be up for (changing light bulbs atop a suspension bridge comes to mind). Mike seems like a genuinely nice guy, and is the ideal host of this show: I appreciate his geniality and wit, but even more I appreciate his genuine respect for these people who do some really, really dirty jobs.When I first heard the concept for this show I thought I would find it boring and formulaic: nothing could be further from the truth. I find it absorbing, entertaining, and educational. I highly recommend this set to anyone and everyone.",5,"""That Is Just A Truck Full Of Vomit You've Got There, My Friend...""",1199145600,"01 1, 2008",2008,3068,"['Dirty', 'Jobs', 'perhaps', 'most', 'entertaining', 'show', 'currently', 'television', 'week', 'affable', 'host', 'Mike', 'Rowe', 'couple', 'utterly', 'revolting', 'jobs', 'make', 'civilization', 'possible', 'yet', 'are', 'mortifyingly', 'unpleasant', 'Collection', '1', 'very', 'best', 'episodes', 'series', 'will', 'make', 'almost', 'everyone', 'grateful', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'living.While', 'episodes', 'are', 'great', 'are', 'few', 'are', 'absolutely', 'extraordinary', 'Monkey', 'Caretaker', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'episodes', 'out', 'monkeys', 'can', 'be', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'deal', 'so', 'can', 'caretaker', 'end', 'several', 'injuries', 'ensue', 'including', 'especially', 'nasty', 'bite', 'sound', 'man', 'leg', 'Ostrich', 'Rancher', 'extraordinary', 'other', 'reason', 'seeing', 'Mike', 'trying', 'put', 'sock', 'angry', 'ostrich', 'head', 'Alpaca', 'Shearer', 'one', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'actually', 'one', 'cleaner', 'jobs', 'can', 'deal', 'high-velocity', 'alpaca', 'spit', 'conclusion', 'one', 'most', 'priceless', 'pieces', 'television', 'genius', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'spoil', 'Shark', 'Patroller', 'special', 'Jobs', 'Bite', 'episode', 'actually', 'one', 'least', 'favorites', 'overall', 'concept', 'jumping', 'ocean', 'bunch', 'freshly-chummed', 'sharks', 'test', 'new', 'shark', 'repellant', 'amazing', 'was', ""n't"", 'wild', 'shark', 'autopsy', 'had', 'dissect', 'shark', 'upper', 'level', 'biology', 'lab', 'college', 'brought', 'back', 'several', 'unpleasant', 'memories', 'also', 'really', 'only', 'thing', 'would', 'say', 'was', 'not', 'suitable', 'small', 'children', 'disc', 'Fuel', 'Tank', 'Cleaner', 'viewer', 'new-found', 'respect', 'aircraft', 'mechanics', 'real', 'meaning', 'claustrophobia', 'Disaster', 'Cleaner', 'Upper', 'second', 'favorite', 'episode', 'efforts', 'valiant', 'team', 'recover', 'basement', 'effects', 'demonically', 'possessed', 'toilet', 'dumped', 'contents', 'entire', 'neighborhood', 'sewer', 'lines', 'unsuspecting', 'house', 'one', 'grossed', 'out', 'especially', 'use', 'garden', 'trowel', 'Casino', 'Food', 'Recycler', 'down', 'favorite', 'episode', 'series', 'so', 'far', 'kindly', 'funny', 'old', 'farmer', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'food', 'scraps', 'raise', 'pigs', 'totally', 'novel', 'operation', 'once', 'amazing', 'disgusting', 'undeniably', 'ecologically', 'sensible.Throughout', 'Mike', 'good-natured', 'intelligent', 'helpful', 'Well', 'least', 'as', 'helpful', 'can', 'be', 'will', 'give', 'one', 'thing', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'admire', 'greatly', 'know', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'up', 'changing', 'light', 'bulbs', 'atop', 'suspension', 'bridge', 'mind', 'Mike', 'genuinely', 'nice', 'guy', 'ideal', 'host', 'show', 'appreciate', 'geniality', 'wit', 'even', 'more', 'appreciate', 'genuine', 'respect', 'people', 'who', 'do', 'really', 'really', 'dirty', 'jobs.When', 'first', 'heard', 'concept', 'show', 'thought', 'would', 'find', 'boring', 'formulaic', 'nothing', 'could', 'be', 'further', 'truth', 'find', 'absorbing', 'entertaining', 'educational', 'highly', 'recommend', 'set', 'anyone', 'everyone']",Dirty Jobs: Collection 1
