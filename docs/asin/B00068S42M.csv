Rather than spend what limited money they had a cheesy special effects they went the esoteric, artful route. That actually worked well. Frankly, it was refreshing to see a moving of this genre that was not all fake places, people and things. Oregon is a beautiful state as well. The pace was a bit slow, although, not as bad as some of the big budget junk out lately. Hey, the guy was on the ""proverbial spiritual quest"". It takes time. My only real knock on this movie is that it ends before it gets started. Just when he finds himself and the real action looks like it's going to begin,, the movie ends. It turns out to be the first installment. But was it good? I must admit, I want to see what happens next. So I guess it was that good.",4,Good but where's  the rest?,1112486400,"04 3, 2005",2005,771,"['was', 'lower', 'budget', 'movie', 'Rather', 'spend', 'what', 'limited', 'money', 'had', 'cheesy', 'special', 'effects', 'went', 'esoteric', 'artful', 'route', 'actually', 'worked', 'well', 'Frankly', 'was', 'refreshing', 'see', 'moving', 'genre', 'was', 'not', 'fake', 'places', 'people', 'things', 'Oregon', 'beautiful', 'state', 'well', 'pace', 'was', 'bit', 'slow', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'big', 'budget', 'junk', 'out', 'lately', 'Hey', 'guy', 'was', 'proverbial', 'spiritual', 'quest', 'time', 'only', 'real', 'knock', 'movie', 'started', 'Just', 'when', 'real', 'action', 'going', 'begin', 'movie', 'out', 'be', 'first', 'installment', 'was', 'good', 'must', 'admit', 'want', 'see', 'what', 'next', 'So', 'guess', 'was', 'good']",Westender
863816,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B00068S42M,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[7, 10]","""Westender"" could be very good, if they'd cut about twenty minutes of the constant walking that the hero, Asbrey the Westender, does throughout the entire film.  The story goes something like this:  A once great knight falls from grace.  No one knows exactly what happened and it's never revealed.  He loses his most prized possession, his deceased wife's ring, in a game of chance while he's drunk.  He decides the next morning, after recovering from a hangover and a beatdown, that he must seek out the man who cheated him out of his ring. What happens after that is pretty standard for a fantasy flick like this.  Asbrey walks...a lot.  He walks through the forests, finds the guy who cheats him, befriends him, then walks some more.  He finds out that the guy who took his ring, a jester named Glim, was jumped by some slavetraders who in turn stole the ring from him.  Asbrey walks some more.  He finds the slavetraders but is captured.  The next morning he is set free by Glim, who then abandons him.  So now he walks alone.  He is lead by a mysterious wolf(I'm assuming it's his wife) and finds his sword, suit of armor, and a mysterious old man who teaches him that material things do not matter.  Asbrey walks some more, this time through a desert that looks something like a sandy beach.  He meets a few more people along the way.  Asbrey uses all of his time alone screaming, crying, and fighting his internal demons.  In the end, our hero must decide whether or not to do what is right or take a selfish turn.This story could have been a lot better.  The idea of the knight fighting himself more than physical enemies is great, but it is dragged out over too much time of walking alone.  It's boring to watch this guy walk through the desert.  It's boring to watch this guy walk through the woods.  The dialogue is minimal, with emphasis placed on the beautiful music throughout the film.  The acting is pretty decent, especially considering that many of the characters are portrayed by volunteers and crew members.Overall, this film isn't too terrible.  Just do yourself a favor and skim through the scenes where Asbrey wanders through the desert until he faces a few foes.  Considering the shoestring budget, the film and music is of very high quality.  It's worth a look simply for the beautiful scenes shot in the forests of Oregon.  When the movie is green, the colors are vibrant.  When the action moves to the desert, it becomes drab.Recommended to fans of medieval fantasy and Arthurian legend, but be warned that this movie drags at a snails pace and the action is very limited.",3,Decent Fantasy Flick That Turns Into A Hiking Documentary,1103155200,"12 16, 2004",2004,2599,"['Westender', 'could', 'be', 'very', 'good', ""'d"", 'cut', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'constant', 'walking', 'hero', 'Asbrey', 'Westender', 'entire', 'film', 'story', 'something', 'once', 'great', 'knight', 'grace', 'one', 'exactly', 'what', 'happened', 'never', 'revealed', 'most', 'prized', 'possession', 'deceased', 'wife', 'ring', 'game', 'chance', 'drunk', 'next', 'morning', 'recovering', 'hangover', 'beatdown', 'must', 'seek', 'out', 'man', 'who', 'cheated', 'ring', 'What', 'pretty', 'standard', 'fantasy', 'flick', 'Asbrey', 'walks', 'lot', 'forests', 'guy', 'who', 'then', 'more', 'out', 'guy', 'who', 'took', 'ring', 'jester', 'named', 'Glim', 'was', 'jumped', 'slavetraders', 'who', 'turn', 'stole', 'ring', 'Asbrey', 'walks', 'more', 'slavetraders', 'captured', 'next', 'morning', 'set', 'free', 'Glim', 'who', 'then', 'So', 'now', 'alone', 'lead', 'mysterious', 'wolf', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'wife', 'sword', 'suit', 'armor', 'mysterious', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'material', 'things', 'do', 'not', 'matter', 'Asbrey', 'walks', 'more', 'time', 'desert', 'something', 'sandy', 'beach', 'few', 'more', 'people', 'way', 'Asbrey', 'time', 'alone', 'screaming', 'crying', 'fighting', 'internal', 'demons', 'end', 'hero', 'must', 'decide', 'not', 'do', 'what', 'right', 'take', 'selfish', 'turn.This', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better', 'idea', 'knight', 'fighting', 'more', 'physical', 'enemies', 'great', 'dragged', 'out', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'walking', 'alone', 'boring', 'watch', 'guy', 'walk', 'desert', 'boring', 'watch', 'guy', 'walk', 'woods', 'dialogue', 'minimal', 'emphasis', 'placed', 'beautiful', 'music', 'film', 'acting', 'pretty', 'decent', 'especially', 'considering', 'many', 'characters', 'are', 'portrayed', 'volunteers', 'crew', 'members.Overall', 'film', ""n't"", 'too', 'terrible', 'Just', 'do', 'favor', 'skim', 'scenes', 'where', 'Asbrey', 'desert', 'few', 'foes', 'Considering', 'shoestring', 'budget', 'film', 'music', 'very', 'high', 'quality', 'look', 'simply', 'beautiful', 'scenes', 'shot', 'forests', 'Oregon', 'When', 'movie', 'green', 'colors', 'are', 'vibrant', 'When', 'action', 'desert', 'drab.Recommended', 'fans', 'medieval', 'fantasy', 'Arthurian', 'legend', 'be', 'warned', 'movie', 'snails', 'pace', 'action', 'very', 'limited']",Westender
863817,A2VUP5US1F5HG5,B00068S42M,K. Jump,"[1, 3]","Buried somewhere deep within WESTENDER'S meandering script there's a good story waiting to break out.  And so for over an hour-and-a-half I watched and waited for that to happen.  Sadly, it never did.  WESTENDER is the story of a disgraced and disillusioned knight's struggle to come to terms with the brutal death of his beloved wife and his own identity.  There are a few quick flashbacks, but most of the backstory is left to the viewer's imagination.  There seems to be a war on, and the King desperately needs the sword of this once-great fighter, but Asbrey of Westender just wants to be left alone with his personal demons.  We follow Asbrey on a long, tedious trek through towering forests and barren desserts where he encounters jesters, hermits, and a strange otherworldy dog while haunted by visions of his wife and past wars.  On paper the plot doesn't sound half-bad, but in practice very little about it actually works.  Most of the film is simply one scene after another of Asbrey walking...and walking...and walking.  Nothing much ever happens to break the monotony.  The acting is respectable and the cast seems earnest, but to no avail. There's just not enough story here, and too much down time.  There is a little action mixed in, but not much.  A couple of characters who seem like they're going to be pretty important just disappear and never come back.  Asbrey's visions are sometimes rather interesting but also very cryptic and never fully explained.  The end of Asbrey's journey is abrubt, unconvincing and a hopeless anti-climax.  What just happened?  What, it's not over, is it?  Yes it is.  WESTENDER is obviously low-budget, but better characterization and more drama could have made up for that.  I've enjoyed many fantastic tales of heroic quests over the years, but WESTENDER may be the worst fantasy I've ever seen.  Poorly paced and awkwardly written, WESTENDER'S journey is best left unfollowed.",2,103 MINUTES OF UNFULFILLED POTENTIAL,1216598400,"07 21, 2008",2008,1931,"['Buried', 'somewhere', 'deep', 'WESTENDER', 'meandering', 'script', 'good', 'story', 'waiting', 'break', 'out', 'so', 'hour-and-a-half', 'watched', 'waited', 'happen', 'Sadly', 'never', 'did', 'WESTENDER', 'story', 'disgraced', 'disillusioned', 'knight', 'struggle', 'come', 'terms', 'brutal', 'death', 'beloved', 'wife', 'own', 'identity', 'are', 'few', 'quick', 'flashbacks', 'most', 'backstory', 'left', 'viewer', 'imagination', 'be', 'war', 'King', 'desperately', 'sword', 'once-great', 'fighter', 'Asbrey', 'Westender', 'just', 'be', 'left', 'alone', 'personal', 'demons', 'follow', 'Asbrey', 'long', 'tedious', 'trek', 'towering', 'forests', 'barren', 'desserts', 'where', 'jesters', 'hermits', 'strange', 'otherworldy', 'dog', 'haunted', 'visions', 'wife', 'past', 'wars', 'paper', 'plot', ""n't"", 'sound', 'half-bad', 'practice', 'very', 'little', 'actually', 'Most', 'film', 'simply', 'one', 'scene', 'Asbrey', 'walking', 'walking', 'walking', 'Nothing', 'much', 'ever', 'break', 'monotony', 'acting', 'respectable', 'cast', 'earnest', 'avail', 'just', 'not', 'enough', 'story', 'here', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'little', 'action', 'mixed', 'not', 'much', 'A', 'couple', 'characters', 'who', 'seem', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'pretty', 'important', 'just', 'disappear', 'never', 'come', 'back', 'Asbrey', 'visions', 'are', 'sometimes', 'rather', 'interesting', 'also', 'very', 'cryptic', 'never', 'fully', 'explained', 'end', 'Asbrey', 'journey', 'abrubt', 'unconvincing', 'hopeless', 'anti-climax', 'What', 'just', 'happened', 'What', 'not', 'Yes', 'WESTENDER', 'obviously', 'low-budget', 'better', 'characterization', 'more', 'drama', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'up', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'many', 'fantastic', 'tales', 'heroic', 'quests', 'years', 'WESTENDER', 'may', 'be', 'worst', 'fantasy', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Poorly', 'paced', 'awkwardly', 'written', 'WESTENDER', 'journey', 'best', 'left', 'unfollowed']",Westender
