Only with the special effects available today, it's a good thing nobody tried to make this movie 15 years ago. When I saw this movie I had already seen the effects in the movie preview, but what surprised me was that it seemed no corners were cut making this. No effort was made to try to cut it down to PG-13 so little Suzie or Johnny could get in..using the 'F' Word a couple million times and a few bare breasts...I was actually glad the director and producer did'nt sell out to appeal to the younger audience. Along with that, the movie shined with never-before-seen special effects and a storyline I think so many people could relate to..""What would you do if no one could see you"". You could pull-off the perfect bank robbery, (forgive me for saying) grab the body of a woman or man who normally would'nt give you the time of day...this plot line along with Kevin Bacon's star status, the eye-popping special effects and sexy Elizabeth Shue made this movie explode.

Kevin Bacon stars as an obsessed scientist on the verge of an earth-shattering breakthrough: it seems as though he has discovered the key to invisibility. After successfully turning himself invisible, he harasses and haunts his co-workers in their secluded underground lab. The crew, fed up with his shenanigans, seeks to find a cure but that only brings the monster out in him, turning things from bad to worse.Director Paul Verhoeven's time-waster is heavy on special effects but light on characters and originality. Bacon chews the scenery as the arrogant scientist on the fritz, while co-stars Josh Brolin and Elisabeth Shue seem like they belong in a better film. Verhoeven does the best he can with an anemic script, but eventually the special effects take over and the film becomes a bloated b-flick with a budget. There are at least a few genuine thrills to be found, and the film carries such a mean-streak and perverted air about it that it at least never gets dull. Unfortunately, like many of the director's latter-day films, ""Hollow Man"" takes things a bit too far and the end result is a sloppy, botched experiment, much like Bacon's science project.While there are certainly worse sci-fi flicks to be found, ""Hollow Man"" is an example of great potential failing to live up to expectations. In this film, you have a solid cast and a director who knows how to entertain within the science-fiction and action realms. There are redeeming qualities to be found, but they are few and far between.

527605,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00003CXK9,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 4]","One thing that can't be praised enough about `Hollow Man' is the amazing, and I mean A-M-A-Z-I-N-G, special effects that are so believable and so impressive you'd swear that it was real.  Sadly, that aside, `Hollow Man' is just that; completely hollow.  There is no substance here.  `Hollow Man' just serves as a sorry excuse for nudity and violence.  I know that complaint sounds strange since this is a horror movie and what else do you expect from a film in this genre other than violence and nudity.  Well, to be completely honest, there is nothing wrong with either of the aforementioned as long as they are strung together by a feasible and interesting plot.  `Hollow Man' just has no point.  It moves from slightly entertaining sci-fi thriller into eerily cold slasher film and then plummets into cheesy and ridiculous action film; all the while nothing of really any interest is taking place on the screen.I think the biggest problem with `Hollow Man' is that none of the characters are interesting.  Kevin Bacon is as boring a villain as they come.  His `god complex' is stereotypical and bland.  Elisabeth Shue and Josh Brolin generate no real heat and while both are beautiful human specimens the film drains them of any acting talent they possess.  In the end we don't really care who lives or dies and that detracts from the entertainment value of the film.The story follows Sebastian Caine, a scientist who is heading a secret government team experimenting with invisibility.  They have so far successfully turned a handful of animals invisible but have had grave difficulty bringing them back to visibility.  Once Caine breaks the code and finds a way to bring the animals back he decides he wants to be the first human to undergo the procedure.  Once invisible he realizes that the same serum that brought the animals back will not work on humans and he winds up invisible for far too long (apparently after being `out' for too long it starts to mess with your mind) and he winds up doing some very questionable things.  Now it's up to his co-workers to stop him before he goes too far.The sad thing is that with a premise like that of `Hollow Man' the director, actors, screen writers; whoever made these decisions had the opportunity to really take this story places.  Instead they resort to the same ol' same.  Sebastian Caine spys on his hot neighbor; attacks her and then starts to kill off his co-workers.  It's predictable and sadly very been-there-done-that.  The acting is also very bland.  Bacon is horrible, truly stereotypical and one-note.The best acting comes from Rhona Mitra...hmmmmmm.In the end I will say that when I first saw this film I loved it.  I was fifteen I think and it had nudity and violence and I didn't care if it was senseless or ridiculous; it was just what I wanted to see.  Now that I'm older I can't see any real value to this movie.  They took masterful, state of the art graphics and pasted them together with a rudimentary plot that took no imagination to construct and that single-handedly drives this film into the ground.  Watch the first twenty minutes of the film to experience the amazing special effects (when they bring the gorilla back to visibility it's a visual god-send) and then turn it off before your mind turns to mush.",2,The title says it all; truly hollow...,1207872000,"04 11, 2008",2008,3290,"['One', 'thing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'praised', 'enough', 'Hollow', 'Man', 'amazing', 'mean', 'A-M-A-Z-I-N-G', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'so', 'believable', 'so', 'impressive', ""'d"", 'swear', 'was', 'real', 'Sadly', 'aside', 'Hollow', 'Man', 'just', 'completely', 'hollow', 'substance', 'here', 'Hollow', 'Man', 'just', 'serves', 'sorry', 'excuse', 'nudity', 'violence', 'know', 'complaint', 'strange', 'horror', 'movie', 'what', 'else', 'do', 'expect', 'film', 'genre', 'other', 'violence', 'nudity', 'Well', 'be', 'completely', 'honest', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'aforementioned', 'as', 'long', 'are', 'strung', 'together', 'feasible', 'interesting', 'plot', 'Hollow', 'Man', 'just', 'point', 'slightly', 'entertaining', 'sci-fi', 'thriller', 'eerily', 'cold', 'slasher', 'film', 'then', 'plummets', 'cheesy', 'ridiculous', 'action', 'film', 'nothing', 'really', 'interest', 'taking', 'place', 'screen.I', 'think', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Hollow', 'Man', 'none', 'characters', 'are', 'interesting', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'boring', 'villain', 'come', 'god', 'complex', 'stereotypical', 'bland', 'Elisabeth', 'Shue', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'generate', 'real', 'heat', 'are', 'beautiful', 'human', 'film', 'acting', 'talent', 'possess', 'end', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'who', 'dies', 'entertainment', 'value', 'film.The', 'story', 'Sebastian', 'Caine', 'scientist', 'who', 'heading', 'secret', 'government', 'team', 'experimenting', 'invisibility', 'have', 'so', 'far', 'successfully', 'turned', 'handful', 'animals', 'invisible', 'have', 'had', 'grave', 'difficulty', 'bringing', 'back', 'visibility', 'Once', 'Caine', 'code', 'way', 'bring', 'animals', 'back', 'be', 'first', 'human', 'undergo', 'procedure', 'Once', 'invisible', 'same', 'serum', 'brought', 'animals', 'back', 'will', 'not', 'work', 'humans', 'up', 'invisible', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'apparently', 'being', 'out', 'too', 'long', 'mess', 'mind', 'up', 'doing', 'very', 'questionable', 'things', 'Now', 'up', 'co-workers', 'stop', 'too', 'far.The', 'sad', 'thing', 'premise', 'Hollow', 'Man', 'director', 'actors', 'screen', 'writers', 'whoever', 'made', 'decisions', 'had', 'opportunity', 'really', 'take', 'story', 'places', 'Instead', 'resort', 'same', 'ol', 'same', 'Sebastian', 'Caine', 'spys', 'hot', 'neighbor', 'then', 'kill', 'off', 'co-workers', 'predictable', 'sadly', 'very', 'been-there-done-that', 'acting', 'also', 'very', 'bland', 'Bacon', 'horrible', 'truly', 'stereotypical', 'one-note.The', 'best', 'acting', 'Rhona', 'Mitra', 'end', 'will', 'say', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'film', 'loved', 'was', 'fifteen', 'think', 'had', 'nudity', 'violence', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'was', 'senseless', 'ridiculous', 'was', 'just', 'what', 'wanted', 'see', 'Now', ""'m"", 'older', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'real', 'value', 'movie', 'took', 'masterful', 'state', 'art', 'graphics', 'pasted', 'together', 'rudimentary', 'plot', 'took', 'imagination', 'construct', 'single-handedly', 'drives', 'film', 'ground', 'Watch', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'film', 'experience', 'amazing', 'special', 'effects', 'when', 'bring', 'gorilla', 'back', 'visibility', 'visual', 'god-send', 'then', 'turn', 'off', 'mind', 'mush']",N/A

Now that I've gone out of my way to say something good about this film, here's what's wrong with it:About three quarters of the film does little more than establish what a childish and jealous egomaniac the character played by Kevin Bacon is.  After he is turned invisible, all he can think of doing with his powers is moving one scientist's drink when she is not looking and molesting a couple of other women.  While Bacon becomes increasingly mentally unstable thanks to the invisibility treatment, the audience is supposed to believe that the so-called brilliant scientists who helped turn him invisible are now unable to turn him visible again because they have suddenly turned so stupid that they don't bother completely replicating the conditions that allowed them to bring a gorilla back from invisibility.  Instead they search for an entirely new way of bringing Bacon back.Finally, during the last 20 minutes of the film after Bacon completely snaps there is a long battle scene which only makes sense if you believe the good scientists' intelligence levels have now been reduced to that of vegetables.  For example, if the scientists put on their infrared goggles they are able to see the heat patterns of their invisible guinea pigs.  But during the battle sequence they don't bother wearing their goggles for more than 2 seconds at a time (well, okay, one of them finally realizes it might be a good idea to keep them on, but only after Bacon has flooded the area with enough hot steam to hide his own heat signature).  The hero of the tale, played by Shue, is also so stupid that, after turning on the sprinklers so she can see Bacon's outline, she stands in a hallway staring in only one direction, allowing him to just waltz up to her from the other direction and attack her from behind (maybe she thought it was one of those new-fangled one-way halls).

After a (just barely) successful experiment on an ape, he (against the cries of partners Elisabeth Shue and Josh Brolin) decides to take the next step and inject himself with the serum. The plan is to bring him back in three days, but after the rejuvenation serum fails, he is stuck invisible for over a week.At this point, Hollow Man veers from mediocre effects thriller to sexually deviant mediocre effects thriller. Caine begins exhibiting the behavior of a teenage boy on the loose, with violent consequences. Bacon does manage to breathe some life into the character, especially at the beginning, but Shue and Brolin are nothing close to believable in their roles.On the plus side, the special effects are marvelous, particularly with ""minor"" ones like the latex mask Caine wears to give his face some visible form. You can see through the eyeholes to the back of the mask. Actually, all the ""invisibility"" effects were stunning, but you can't expect effects to carry a film with a weak storyline.

527639,A2KG8WLR1AKO12,B00003CXK9,"David Thomson ""Second Rate Eric Hoffer Imitator""","[2, 4]","Hollow Man is an awful film.  Director Paul Verhoeven seemed unable to decide whether to create a fast pace horror film, or to focus upon the existential questions of one becoming invisible.  Would invisibility inherently weaken one's bonds with the wider human community?  Is the temptation of exploiting such a condition too strong to resist?  Verhoeven instead opted for some admittedly fantastic special effects to salvage a very mediocre script.  This rarely, if ever succeeds---and most certainly didn't work with Hollow Man.  Also, who is responsible for the mediocre music score?  It reminded me of the quickly thrown together music that was prevalent in the B movies of the 1960s.Kevin Bacon portrays the egotistical scientist, Sebastian Caine, who is the executive director of a military program to turn people invisible.  He jokes about being God, but it is obvious that he at least half believes this to be true.  The gorgeous Linda McKay (Elizabeth Shue) is a member of his research team who has romantically left him for the less gifted scientist Matthew Kensington (Josh Brolin).  They have long experimented upon animals with a fair degree of success.  Now it is time to take it to the next step and pick a human guinea pig.  The arrogant and self centered Dr. Caine chooses himself while disregarding all ethical norms and regulations.  Caine finds himself ultimately trapped by his invisibility, and lashes out against the cruel set of circumstances dooming him to the fringes of human society.  He surrenders to the temptation to sexually violate women. Soon even murder is no longer considered a line in the sand not to be crossed.  The story rapidly becomes convoluted and absurd.  Logic is thrown out the window, and Verhoeven can do little more than throw extremely violent and cruel scenes onto the screen.  The makers of Hollow Man likely realized the film was doomed.  They simply wanted to get it over with and hope for the best.Only those fans of spectacular special effects should make a point of viewing this lackluster movie.  Hollow Man deserves a mere three stars.

527643,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00003CXK9,D. Litton,"[1, 2]","With all of the buzz that surrounded the release of &quot;Hollow Man&quot; before its release on August 4th, it's easy for me to see why so many critics downed this movie as a lame excuse for special effects and violence. If you've seen the trailer, then you probably already know too much of what is going to happen, kind of like the fiasco that occurred with &quot;Double Jeopardy.&quot; So basically, this is a movie where the viewer is left to decide whether or not it is any good.Personally, I found it to be quite enjoyable. Sure, it does fall into some of the all-too-familiar horror/thriller clich&eacute;s, and it seems as though the final third could've been carried out in a different way. But if all you're looking for is a simple Friday night movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat in certain intense moments, then it is not a failure.&quot;Hollow Man&quot; is the only movie I've ever seen that hosts such a shocking opening scene. A small rat runs into a large cage, where it is lifted by an unseen force and eaten, with vivid detail. We soon learn that this is part of an experiment funded by the Defense Department in order to discover the key to the invisibility of mammals. The animals are merely test subjects under project leader Sebastian Caine, until he discovers the code to reverse the process. He keeps this discovery a secret from the government, telling his partner Linda McKay that he wants to go ahead with the third phase himself, which involves testing it on himself. Despite the risks at stake, she and Matthew Kensington go along with it, and soon, the process goes ahead and Sebastian disappears from human visibility. But when his reversal process proves a failure on humans, his morality begins breaking down, and he settles into a deranged lifestyle of mayhem and murder, willing to stop at nothing to keep his success a secret from everyone.With all of this in mind, &quot;Hollow Man&quot; is not a bad movie. It does contain its share of genuine thrills and scares, while also giving the storyline a sophisticated and intelligent feel in terms of its scientific aspects. The action does keep moving despite a couple of old-fashioned thriller clich&eacute;s, but even then this may provide for a bit of relief. It does seem as though the third act of the film is a bit underachieved. With all the suspense that the movie builds up to, there seems to be so many other approaches the writers could've taken, but hey: this is a summer thriller movie, so it fits nicely into its genre.The special effects used for this movie are nothing short of amazing. What makes this movie all-the-more believable is that Kevin Bacon, playing Sebastian, is able to play opposite the other actors, even in the invisibility scenes. Special make-up techniques and computer animation and recreation make each completed shot seamless and simply stunning, and it does have to be said: this is one of the best special effects movies ever made.Actors also do a great job, and know what they are doing with their characters. Kevin Bacon is quite the evading psycho killer as Sebastian, and just the sound of his voice will send chills up your spine in the most intense moments. Elizabeth Shue is, as always, astounding in her role of Linda McKay, and when the action begins to mount, she is always on hand to keep it moving at twice the speed. She is also able to make audiences believe in her character's intelligence and ability as a scientist. Josh Brolin does a good job as the hero-for-a-day character Matthew, and despite his character's all-too-familiar entrances to save the day, he plays them all so well, like the idea is totally brand new.To sum it up, &quot;Hollow Man&quot; is a good movie. Not great; just good. It has the suspense, the thrills, and the action needed to make it a plausible thriller, though those looking for more substance will be at a bit of a loss. It can be smart and intelligent at times, while giving its audiences a simple story that is easy to follow and quite enjoyable.",3,Not that bad.,979430400,"01 14, 2001",2001,4034,"['buzz', 'surrounded', 'release', 'quot', 'Hollow', 'Man', 'quot', 'release', 'August', '4th', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'critics', 'downed', 'movie', 'lame', 'excuse', 'special', 'effects', 'violence', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'trailer', 'then', 'probably', 'already', 'know', 'too', 'much', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'kind', 'fiasco', 'occurred', 'quot', 'Double', 'Jeopardy.', 'quot', 'So', 'basically', 'movie', 'where', 'viewer', 'left', 'decide', 'not', 'good.Personally', 'found', 'be', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'Sure', 'fall', 'all-too-familiar', 'horror/thriller', 'clich', 'eacute', 'final', 'third', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'carried', 'out', 'different', 'way', ""'re"", 'looking', 'simple', 'Friday', 'night', 'movie', 'will', 'keep', 'edge', 'seat', 'certain', 'intense', 'moments', 'then', 'not', 'failure.', 'quot', 'Hollow', 'Man', 'quot', 'only', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'hosts', 'shocking', 'opening', 'scene', 'small', 'rat', 'large', 'cage', 'where', 'lifted', 'unseen', 'force', 'eaten', 'vivid', 'detail', 'soon', 'learn', 'part', 'experiment', 'funded', 'Defense', 'Department', 'order', 'discover', 'key', 'invisibility', 'mammals', 'animals', 'are', 'merely', 'test', 'subjects', 'project', 'leader', 'Sebastian', 'Caine', 'code', 'reverse', 'process', 'discovery', 'secret', 'government', 'telling', 'partner', 'Linda', 'McKay', 'go', 'ahead', 'third', 'phase', 'testing', 'risks', 'stake', 'Matthew', 'Kensington', 'go', 'along', 'soon', 'process', 'ahead', 'Sebastian', 'disappears', 'human', 'visibility', 'when', 'reversal', 'process', 'failure', 'humans', 'morality', 'breaking', 'down', 'deranged', 'lifestyle', 'mayhem', 'murder', 'willing', 'stop', 'nothing', 'keep', 'success', 'secret', 'everyone.With', 'mind', 'quot', 'Hollow', 'Man', 'quot', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'contain', 'share', 'genuine', 'thrills', 'scares', 'also', 'giving', 'storyline', 'sophisticated', 'intelligent', 'feel', 'terms', 'scientific', 'aspects', 'action', 'keep', 'moving', 'couple', 'old-fashioned', 'thriller', 'clich', 'eacute', 'even', 'then', 'may', 'provide', 'bit', 'relief', 'seem', 'third', 'act', 'film', 'bit', 'underachieved', 'suspense', 'movie', 'be', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'approaches', 'writers', 'could', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'hey', 'summer', 'thriller', 'movie', 'nicely', 'genre.The', 'special', 'effects', 'used', 'movie', 'are', 'nothing', 'short', 'amazing', 'What', 'movie', 'all-the-more', 'believable', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'playing', 'Sebastian', 'able', 'play', 'opposite', 'other', 'actors', 'even', 'invisibility', 'scenes', 'Special', 'make-up', 'techniques', 'computer', 'animation', 'recreation', 'make', 'completed', 'shot', 'seamless', 'simply', 'stunning', 'have', 'be', 'said', 'one', 'best', 'special', 'effects', 'movies', 'ever', 'made.Actors', 'also', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'characters', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'quite', 'evading', 'psycho', 'killer', 'Sebastian', 'just', 'sound', 'voice', 'will', 'send', 'chills', 'up', 'spine', 'most', 'intense', 'moments', 'Elizabeth', 'Shue', 'always', 'astounding', 'role', 'Linda', 'McKay', 'when', 'action', 'mount', 'always', 'hand', 'keep', 'moving', 'twice', 'speed', 'also', 'able', 'make', 'audiences', 'believe', 'character', 'intelligence', 'ability', 'scientist', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'good', 'job', 'hero-for-a-day', 'character', 'Matthew', 'character', 'all-too-familiar', 'entrances', 'save', 'day', 'so', 'well', 'idea', 'totally', 'brand', 'new.To', 'sum', 'up', 'quot', 'Hollow', 'Man', 'quot', 'good', 'movie', 'Not', 'great', 'just', 'good', 'suspense', 'thrills', 'action', 'needed', 'make', 'plausible', 'thriller', 'looking', 'more', 'substance', 'will', 'be', 'bit', 'loss', 'can', 'be', 'smart', 'intelligent', 'times', 'giving', 'audiences', 'simple', 'story', 'easy', 'follow', 'quite', 'enjoyable']",N/A

Go hang out in a morgue or sit in on an anatomy class and see the real thing.  The plot of this sad effort is moronic--why any of the characters do what they do is inexplicable, and why they don't use their heads and *think* about what to do is ONLY because the writers and director didn't CARE enough to come up with a plot.  I mean, seriously, you are smart enough to be working on a top secret research project with major government funds, but when your boss turns into an invisible homicidal maniac, it doesn't occur to you to always wear the special glasses which allow you to see him?  This kind of inanity pervades the movie.  And why this bothered me so much, I'm not quite sure--but when they make a latex mask for Kevin Bacon, they don't bother to cut holes in it for his nostrils!  If you've ever worn a diving mask, you'd know how humid and uncomfortable that would be within seconds.  In fact, I've had my face cast, and they put straws in my nose so that I could BREATHE DURING THE PROCEDURE!  So there were holes in the mask from the very beginning.  It's this carelessness that drives me to distraction--if you are going to put millions of dollars into a film, why not really THINK about it, instead of insulting our intelligence?

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[3, 3]","There are movies that make you feel dirty and miserable, because there is simply nothing there to like -- not characters, plot or even a good feeling.One good example: &#34;Hollow Man,&#34; the loosest possible adaptation of H.G. Wells' classic novel &#34;The Invisible Man&#34;... except that instead of one stupid scientist, we have a whole cast of them. Gratuitous animal-abuse, rape, some great special effects and a despicable cast of annoying characters... well, it's easy to see why Paul Verhoeven hasn't made an American movie since, even if it was very profitable.A bunch of scientists are working on an invisibility formula for the military, led by the arrogant Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon). When they successfully return a gorilla to visibility (almost killing it in the process), Sebastian decides that it's time for human trials -- and secretly has the team inject HIM with the serum. All seems to be going well... until the reversion therapy fails. Sebastian is stuck until his team finds a cure.And unfortunately, the serum seems to be making him cruel, violent and psychotic -- he uses his invisibility to spy on his increasingly paranoid team, including his ex-girlfriend Linda (Elisabeth Shue) and her new boyfriend. And to stop the team from warning the military about the danger he poses, he's willing to trap and kill them one by one...&#34;The Hollow Man&#34; is the loosest possible interpretation of &#34;The Invisible Man&#34; -- the only thing that connects them is an invisibility serum that makes you crazy and evil. But while there was only ONE scientist doing stupid things in H.G. Wells' story, this movie has SEVERAL scientists doing stupid things. A lot of stupid things.I will say this: the special effects are spectacular, particularly the process of both Sebastian and the gorilla turning invisible and visible again. Almost fifteen years later, they still hold up beautifully -- the dissolves of skin, muscles, veins and bones are almost grotesque in their realism.Here's what's wrong: EVERYTHING ELSE. The plot is entirely dependent on people doing idiotic things -- the entire premise is that these scientists stupidly decided to secretly start human testing because... well, because Sebastian wants too. No better reason. It's riddled with a thousand tiny holes (a gorilla hits a guy and he doesn't even get bruised!), and the dialogue drips with sleaze. There are a few amusing moments (Sebastian freaking out some kids with his &#34;hollow&#34; face), but the rest of the movie taints them.It's also painfully obvious from the beginning that Sebastian is going to immediately go evil and develop a god complex. But since Verhoeven is not known for his subtlety, this is expressed by him beating animals to death and making comments so obviously psychopathic that I'm surprised he didn't go &#34;Mwahahahahaha!&#34; at the end of every sentence.And there's an ugly streak of misogyny that runs through the movie like a stream of fetid excrement -- and the brutal rape scene is only the most obvious example, especially since we never see that poor woman again. She is literally there just to be leered at and raped. If it were just Sebastian, that would be okay, but the hostile yet voyeuristic attitude seems to permeate the entire film.I think it's the movie's intention to make us hate Sebastian, which is a massive mistake -- Kevin Bacon is easily a good enough actor to bring dimension to the arrogant, callous Sebastian, and evoke some kind of sympathy for him. We should feel somewhat sorry for a man going mad. Except Verhoeven makes you hate him from the beginning, and makes it clear that there is no good in this man, so he ends up basically being a less witty, less visible Freddy Krueger.The sad thing is that the primary concept of &#34;Hollow Man&#34; is a good one, but the ugly, sleazy way it's presented just squanders it.

Hollow Man takes the idea of the classic Sci Fi movie The Invisible Man and gives it a total shake up. Kevin Bacon plays a government scientist that is testing the possibilies of becoming invisible.He and his team test this new and possibly revolutionary idea on of course, animals and finally, their hopes and works come true as they rematerialize an invisible gorilla. Thinking that Bacon is safe, he has his team turn him invisible hoping that he will be able to rematerialize as well. Things start to go wrong as Bacon and his team are unable to bring him back, he then goes insane and furious and starts taking his revenge on his team, government officials and anyone else that gets in his way.O.k. now here's the bad news. Now normally that sounds really good, but in this day and age, 5 star special effects don't and can't help a poor script and bad plotted movies. I'll say it, it was a great idea but it was poorly executed. Don't get me wrong, the effects are awesome, phenomenal and nothing else was like them. The problem was that the plot was so vast and doubtful (even for Sci Fi) that it made the movie cheap.The other thing that made this one bad was that the characters in the movie (aside from Bacon), might as well have been air brushed in because for the most part, it seemed like they didn't matter because the supporting cast felt nonexistant. None of them gave strong performances or even had adequate dialogue to match Bacon's (and even his was not that impressive).I think the lesson here is that it's no longer the 80's and that when movies have great effects and bad scripts, don't be too surprised if you feel let down because of that. It's good to have high expectations in the viewing of your choice. It's just that Hollow Man shouldn't be a part of that.",2,"Great special effects, horrid script",1037664000,"11 19, 2002",2002,1846,"['Hollow', 'Man', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'Hollow', 'Man', 'idea', 'classic', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'movie', 'Invisible', 'Man', 'total', 'shake', 'up', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'government', 'scientist', 'testing', 'possibilies', 'becoming', 'invisible.He', 'team', 'test', 'new', 'possibly', 'revolutionary', 'idea', 'course', 'animals', 'finally', 'hopes', 'come', 'true', 'rematerialize', 'invisible', 'gorilla', 'Thinking', 'Bacon', 'safe', 'team', 'turn', 'invisible', 'hoping', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'rematerialize', 'as', 'well', 'Things', 'start', 'go', 'wrong', 'Bacon', 'team', 'are', 'unable', 'bring', 'back', 'then', 'insane', 'furious', 'taking', 'revenge', 'team', 'government', 'officials', 'anyone', 'else', 'way.O.k', 'now', 'here', 'bad', 'news', 'Now', 'normally', 'really', 'good', 'day', 'age', '5', 'star', 'special', 'effects', 'do', ""n't"", 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'poor', 'script', 'bad', 'plotted', 'movies', ""'ll"", 'say', 'was', 'great', 'idea', 'was', 'poorly', 'executed', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'effects', 'are', 'awesome', 'phenomenal', 'nothing', 'else', 'was', 'problem', 'was', 'plot', 'was', 'so', 'vast', 'doubtful', 'even', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'made', 'movie', 'other', 'thing', 'made', 'one', 'bad', 'was', 'characters', 'movie', 'aside', 'Bacon', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'air', 'brushed', 'most', 'part', 'seemed', 'did', ""n't"", 'matter', 'supporting', 'cast', 'felt', 'nonexistant', 'None', 'gave', 'strong', 'performances', 'even', 'had', 'adequate', 'dialogue', 'match', 'Bacon', 'even', 'was', 'not', 'impressive', '.I', 'think', 'lesson', 'here', 'no', 'longer', '80', 'when', 'movies', 'have', 'great', 'effects', 'bad', 'scripts', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'surprised', 'feel', 'let', 'down', 'good', 'have', 'high', 'expectations', 'viewing', 'choice', 'just', 'Hollow', 'Man', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'part']",N/A

From sexually assaulting a woman he watches from his apartment to killing people, and copping a feel from his fellow female employees.

The people really working on the bleeding edge of scientific research are all brilliant and insightful.  This movie makes them look like they are completely lacking in the common sense department.  There are so many things about the movie props that bothered me, from the unsecured cordless phones they used in the lab, to the impractical use of an environmentally controlled &quot;junk&quot; closet, with a secure locking mechanism that could only be opened from the outside.It's also frustrating to watch.  So many times I thought to myself, &quot;why don't you just keep those damned glasses on!&quot; and &quot;just set off the fire alarm/sprinkler system to alert the guard!&quot; and &quot;the network still works, just email for help!&quot; and &quot;just turn off all the lights in the lab, so he can't see you either!&quot;.  The idiocy of the main characters had me constantly throwing my arms in the air or placing my hands over my eyes while shaking my head in disbelief.  It would have been passable as a slasher flick if they had spent even a minimal amount of screen-time at character development, and I've never seen Elizabeth Shue look so ugly in a film.  Animal enthuasiasts will not be happy at the way most of the characters treat the animals... especially the fact that the remaining few die in the explosion near the end.

527658,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00003CXK9,"""flickjunkie""","[3, 4]","This is an utterly unoriginal update of H.G. Wells ""Invisible Man"", which was first made into a movie in 1933.  In that story, a scientist invents a formula to make beings invisible and after taking it himself, he goes mad and goes on a killing spree.  This film doesn't vary much from that formula except, unfortunately, the presentation is as unintelligent as that of a low budget slasher film.Invisibility is a premise that is fertile with possibilities.  It could have taken any number of directions other than a hack movie.  Writers Gary Scott Thompson and Andrew Marlowe venture into voyeurism and molestation and stop just short of rape, which could have been an interesting main theme for a detective story.  Instead, they use it only as an appetizer and then default to the unimaginative.  Another possibility would have been to use the advantage of invisibility to steal money or top-secret information to accumulate power.  However, why waste time writing an original script when you can trot out yet another production line monster?  In the typical B horror movie tradition, the truculent Dr. Caine (Kevin Bacon) is ""killed"" at least four times, each by means no human being could survive.Director Paul Verhoven has long been associated with sci-fi thrillers (Robo Cop, Total Recall, Starship Troopers).  What they all seem to have in common is good special effects and weak stories.  I don't know whether this is bad judgment on Verhoven's part in selecting projects or poor presentation; probably it's a bit of each.If there is one area where this film is superlative, it is visual effects.  The transformation to and from invisibility is fantastic, almost a lesson in anatomy as the various organs of the body are peeled away a layer at a time.  The incorporation of this effect with an actor writhing against restraints on the operating table is astonishing.  In addition, the renderings of the form of the invisible man seen by various means are astounding.  He produces one silhouette while under water, another when sprayed with a fire extinguisher and still another when seen with infrared glasses.  These effects alone are worth suffering through this clunker.Kevin Bacon gives a good performance as the maniac.  He is extremely believable in malevolent roles.  The DVD has a featurette that shows how some of the effects were done.  They required Bacon to wear head-to-toe blue, green and black body suits for various effects, many of which took hours to apply and were uncomfortable to wear.  I have to give him credit for still being able to act while trussed up this way.  Elizabeth Shue is wrong for this role.  She does well in sexy roles, lovable roles and sometimes even intelligent roles, but she is definitely not suited for action roles.  Josh Brolin give a credible performance as Caine's rival.This film is a bundle of wasted potential.  I rated it a 6/10, a kindness bestowed in honor of vanguard visual effects.  Lovers of mindless gore add two points.  It's worth seeing for the visuals if you can stomach a variation on ""Friday the Thirteenth"" in the last 30 minutes.",3,Slick visual effects for a high budget B movie,978912000,"01 8, 2001",2001,3105,"['utterly', 'unoriginal', 'update', 'H.G', 'Wells', 'Invisible', 'Man', 'was', 'first', 'made', 'movie', '1933', 'story', 'scientist', 'formula', 'make', 'beings', 'invisible', 'taking', 'mad', 'killing', 'spree', 'film', ""n't"", 'vary', 'much', 'formula', 'unfortunately', 'presentation', 'as', 'unintelligent', 'low', 'budget', 'slasher', 'film.Invisibility', 'premise', 'fertile', 'possibilities', 'could', 'have', 'taken', 'number', 'directions', 'other', 'hack', 'movie', 'Writers', 'Gary', 'Scott', 'Thompson', 'Andrew', 'Marlowe', 'venture', 'voyeurism', 'molestation', 'stop', 'just', 'short', 'rape', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'main', 'theme', 'detective', 'story', 'Instead', 'use', 'only', 'appetizer', 'then', 'default', 'unimaginative', 'possibility', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'use', 'advantage', 'invisibility', 'steal', 'money', 'top-secret', 'information', 'accumulate', 'power', 'However', 'why', 'waste', 'time', 'writing', 'original', 'script', 'when', 'can', 'trot', 'out', 'yet', 'production', 'line', 'monster', 'typical', 'B', 'horror', 'movie', 'tradition', 'truculent', 'Dr.', 'Caine', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'killed', 'least', 'four', 'times', 'human', 'being', 'could', 'survive.Director', 'Paul', 'Verhoven', 'long', 'been', 'associated', 'sci-fi', 'thrillers', 'Robo', 'Cop', 'Total', 'Recall', 'Starship', 'Troopers', 'What', 'seem', 'have', 'common', 'good', 'special', 'effects', 'weak', 'stories', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'bad', 'judgment', 'Verhoven', 'part', 'selecting', 'projects', 'poor', 'presentation', 'probably', 'bit', 'each.If', 'one', 'area', 'where', 'film', 'superlative', 'visual', 'effects', 'transformation', 'invisibility', 'fantastic', 'almost', 'lesson', 'anatomy', 'various', 'organs', 'body', 'are', 'peeled', 'away', 'layer', 'time', 'incorporation', 'effect', 'actor', 'writhing', 'restraints', 'operating', 'table', 'astonishing', 'addition', 'renderings', 'form', 'invisible', 'man', 'seen', 'various', 'means', 'are', 'astounding', 'one', 'silhouette', 'water', 'when', 'sprayed', 'fire', 'extinguisher', 'still', 'when', 'seen', 'infrared', 'glasses', 'effects', 'alone', 'are', 'worth', 'suffering', 'clunker.Kevin', 'Bacon', 'good', 'performance', 'maniac', 'extremely', 'believable', 'malevolent', 'roles', 'DVD', 'featurette', 'how', 'effects', 'were', 'done', 'required', 'Bacon', 'wear', 'head-to-toe', 'blue', 'green', 'black', 'body', 'suits', 'various', 'effects', 'many', 'took', 'hours', 'apply', 'were', 'uncomfortable', 'wear', 'have', 'give', 'credit', 'still', 'being', 'able', 'act', 'trussed', 'up', 'way', 'Elizabeth', 'Shue', 'wrong', 'role', 'well', 'sexy', 'roles', 'lovable', 'roles', 'sometimes', 'even', 'intelligent', 'roles', 'definitely', 'not', 'suited', 'action', 'roles', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'give', 'credible', 'performance', 'Caine', 'rival.This', 'film', 'bundle', 'wasted', 'potential', 'rated', '6/10', 'kindness', 'bestowed', 'honor', 'vanguard', 'visual', 'effects', 'Lovers', 'mindless', 'gore', 'add', 'two', 'points', 'worth', 'seeing', 'visuals', 'can', 'stomach', 'variation', 'Friday', 'Thirteenth', 'last', '30', 'minutes']",N/A

In fact, I felt like the first two-thirds of this movie was decent enough. However, then as many movies do of this caliber, it got extremely rediculous. Kevin Bacon offered little to the movie; I actually felt as though many of the other characters were better developed. Bacon acts so cocky and tries to be the ""bad"" boy so much that it is kind of sickening towards the end of the movie. And, of course, after becoming the invisible man, he goes mad and then proceeds to become ""God"" (or so he says). Why is it that when someone is shot, stabbed, or, in this case, engulfed with fire like a summer hot dog, they never die in Hollywood movies?  They come back like 2,3, 4 times and still go after the person who is trying to destroy them. Then of course, Elizabeth Shue's character says her line ""Go to hell"" (in the manner of ""Hasta La Vista"") and the villian falls to his death (apparently, because you never really know).

A working prototype has given them success with other primates, but the possibility of an invisible man remains out of their grasps.  Bacon plays a mad genius type. Combine that with the fact that the serum leads to increased aggression and the plot is as see through as the hollow man himself.Due credit goes to the special effects crew. The changing sequences were masterful and fluid.  Suspense was made possible with ingenious hints as to the hollow man's presence.  The movie is worth seeing and buying for the visual aspects alone.  However, the letdown is with plot aspects.  Yes there are some moments where Bacon uses his invisibility for diabolical means, but overall the film doesnt explore the age old axium of just how  much good natured mischief you could have if noone could see you.Overall, the acting was good, the effects were superb, but the story line was a bummer.

Instead of things we've now seen a hundred times, like car chases, buildings collapsing, etc, we are treated to seeing a gorilla's body appear from the inside out, and then the human body disappear from the outside in. It was pretty fascinating. After that, the movie was still pretty good. It was the end (and by this I mean the final third, which is a good portion of the movie) that was NOT good. Stop reading here if you have not yet seen the movie.The biggest problem, in my opinion, is that Sebastian, the doctor who becomes invisible, suddenly seems to become immortal, and that makes no sense. Being invisible has caused him to become sick with power and lose control, and the other scientists are forced to fight back. The problem is the guy just won't die! At one point, the one girl dumps a bag of blood on him, yet minutes later he is completely invisible again, so the others can't find him. Now just when did he have time for an extensive shower to get all that blood out of his hair? After that, they beat him with a crowbar. He comes after them. They spray him with fire. He comes after them. They electrocute him. He comes after them. But at least this has made him half visible! The worst part is that after the lab explodes and the elevator collapses on him, he makes his way through the trap door in the elevator and comes after them yet again. No, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe the worst part is that Hollow Man 2 ended the same way: the guy got up and came after them after falling out a 2-story window, without even a limp. And didn't he get half-visible after being electrocuted somehow? I forget for sure. Yep, I watched the sequel.

527687,A2TDK8D4HEMUYW,B00003CXK9,"John ""MovieAddict""","[7, 9]","Paul Verhoeven directed ""RoboCop"" (1987), ""Total Recall"" (1990), and ""Basic Instinct"" (1992). His films all have a hard edge. ""Hollow Man"" has the edge. It's lacking the brains and heart of the others.Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) is a brilliant scientist in charge of a US Government-funded underground facility investigating into invisibility serums. They have the ability to turn animals invisible, but up until now there has been no way to reverse it. Now, Sebastian has found a reversal formula, and it works.Sebastian, afraid his research will be stolen away from him, keeps all records of progress from the military. He is obsessed with power and he doesn't know what to do now that it's all over. (""It feels like the beginning of the end,"" he says.) And so without asking for permission from his funding, Sebastian becomes the first human to turn invisible to the naked eye - the only thing that can pick up his traces are heat goggles that look like something out of a science fiction movie. Oh, wait...The serum starts to take a deadly turn, however, when Sebastian feels that everyone is out to get him. He is afraid his colleagues will turn him in, and so he traps them underground and starts to kill them off, one-by-one.His fellow scientists include: Linda (Elisabeth Shue, who somehow gets top billing over Bacon), Matthew (Josh Brolin), Sarah (Kim Dickens), Carter (Greg Grunberg), and Kramer (William Devane). Linda was his ex-lover sometime in the past. Now she's going out with Matthew. Sebastian doesn't like this; it's part of what triggers his ferocious outbreak in the first place. In short, the guy goes crazy and there's nothing they can do about it except pray and hunt him down with their little goggles and stun guns.Sebastian considers himself God. (""How many times have I told you you're not God? I am."") We can tell from the beginning that he has problems with control and superiority. The serum, which has some serious side effects like those you hear in fine print on commercials for medicine, only unleashes his darker side he tries to conceal.And Verhoeven has a strong handle on the different phases of his personality change, unlike most films. Unforunately, whereas ""RoboCop"" and ""Total Recall"" seemed much more serious, ""Hollow Man,"" like his 1997 film ""Starship Troopers,"" feels too over-the-top and goofy for its own good. His earlier films always had a touch of that over-the-top action spectacular stuff. This one has too much.If there were ever a movie for Paul Verhoeven, it is this. It's the tailor-made film just for him, much like ""RoboCop"" was. He has free roam to create an invisible man who slowly becomes hostile and hunts his victims. Think about ""Total Recall""--remember how Verhoeven's imaginations were perfectly displayed on screen? How real it all was? How gripping and suspenseful?There's something missing here. It's the perfect material for Verhoeven, and it has his distinctly hard edge, but it is dumb, and it feels more like an average slasher movie with a large budget than a smart thriller. Especially towards the end, which has its fun parts but becomes over-the-top and quite ridiculous. Of course, the bad guy always gets back up for one last scare, but (spoiler alert!) Sebastian gets up three times. And he's not even supernatural -- he's just invisible. He gets torched with a flamethrower, knocked over the head, electrocuted, and blown up his lab facility. Then he manages to climb up an elevator shaft and grab Linda one last time. HUH? And since when does electricity not spread through water? These guys are extremely advanced scientists, yet they never stop to ponder over why basic science knowledge has just been proved incorrect.I'm being too harsh. I won't lie. The film has its moments of interest and truly amazing special effects--some of the best I've ever seen in a motion picture, in fact. If ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" was an opening for live action/animation and ""Terminator 2"" was the breakthrough motion picture for pure special effects, this is the next level. It starts with an intriguing premise, just as ""RoboCop"" and ""Total Recall"" did, only those two films kept elevating the action, suspense, plot, and emotional attachment, something that ""Hollow Man"" is lacking. Perhaps a better title would have been ""Hollow Movie""?""Hollow Man"" is rated R for strong violence, language, and sexuality/nudity.",2,Hollow Man?

527688,A356HRZZFCEGL1,B00003CXK9,"John Panagopoulos ""John Andrew Panagopoulos""","[2, 2]","A while ago I caught ""Hollow Man"" on cable. I entered at about the point Sebastian Crane (Kevin Bacon), now invisible, infiltrated the young female intern's apartment and started to unsettle her with his pranks. Based on the portion of the movie I saw, ""Hollow Man"" is an implausible, but a fairly and mechanically entertaining horror schlock fest with undeniably impeccable special effects. It isn't necessary for me to provide yet another plot synopsis.  The other 200+ posts have already amply done that. However, I wish to discuss the fundamental reason why ""Hollow Man"" in my opinion is not a particularly effective or memorable sci-fi/horror movie: Its premise, the ""power"" of invisibility, in and of itself, is really quite weak.The movie's obvious inspiration, H.G. Wells's classic novel ""The Invisible Man"" itself meticulously spells out the numerous disadvantages of invisibility. Even the invisible, megalomanicial protagonist himself considers himself a ""helpless absurdity"". The disadvantages include: 1) unless you also make your clothes invisible, which the novel's protagonist actually could but didn't have time to do, your naked invisible body is more vulnerable to the elements and to disease, 2) dust, soot, and rain will reveal your outline, 3) eaten meals will outline your invisible stomach until the food is digested. 4) animals such as dogs can still hear or smell your presence. In other words, an invisible person still possesses the flaws of an ordinary human being.Furthermore, ironically, an invisible person would be more conspicuous to the public than an ordinary person. That's because, as the novel points out, invisibility grants you the power to obtain things, but not enjoy them once you get them. So, for example, you can rob a bank without being seen, but you can't get away with the money without being noticed.The above-mentioned disadvantages existed even in the novel's 19th century setting. In modern times, invisibility is even more of a disadvantage. Motion detectors and heat-imaging sensors can detect even an invisible man's presence. Therefore, an invisible villain may get a few limited jollies at the outset, but will still be easily captured by sensible heroes.To its credit, ""Hollow Man"" recognizes some of invisibility's disadvantages. However, it artificially shifts the edge to Sebastian in order to even have a movie. Yes, the heroes have heat-sensing goggles, but the lab automatically becomes uniformly warm to hide Sebastian's temperature. Out in the real world, the naked Sebastian would be easily detected and apprehended, so the movie's climactic action must remain in the claustrophobic lab. And, as others have mentioned, invisibility does not confer invulnerability (even if adrenalin surges can partially account for Sebastian's newfound resistance to pain). Finally of course, to keep the plot moving, Sebastian's pursuers, his former lab associates, must do inexplicably idiotic things, like not making sure Sebastian stays out after being clubbed, electrocuted, burned, etc.To conclude, invisibility has its (limited) uses and can supplement other abilities, but in its own right is not really remarkable.

Well more like he tests it on himself and despite almost dying in the process it works and initially things seem fine, he's kept under observation but gets cabin fever being trapped in the building so he breaks out at one point and attacks a woman in her apartment (played by the gorgeous Rhona Mitra, ""Doomsday"").After beginning to feel Caine may be going a little nuts given that he can no longer see himself and that this invisible power is going to his head, the team tries to develop a cure for this condition. Caine doesn't like hearing about this and turns quite homicidal, targeting everyone on the team, in fairly goofy and cheesy fashion. Sadly the special effects are the only decent part of this movie as director Paul Verhoeven, (""Starship Troopers"") pretty much has nothing positive going on in this movie.Really bad acting here, even Bacon seems lost with having to play the villain and be very one note with his role, Shue is very typical as the female lead and Josh Brolin (""No Country For Old Men"") is also in this as a fellow scientist.

I would award 3 stars, not 2.OK, the Kevin Bacon character is one despicable sicko, totally undeserving of any viewer sympathy. But then, I can't recall any Bacon character in any movie I've seen as being particularly likable - even when he played a Good Guy. He always seems badly in need of an attitude adjustment.  Moreover, even more ridiculous than the improbabilities that my friend from Riga so succinctly pointed out was the scene where bags of blood, otherwise meant for transfusion, were ripped open and the contents splashed on the floor as an early warning system, so to speak. I work for a company that manufactures such bags and, trust me, one can't just tear apart the RF body welds on those like packages of trail mix. However ...I never dissected a great ape in biology class, but I have attended a couple of human autopsies, so I'm not completely unaware of what's below the skin. The scene where the ape's innards were brought back to visibility was exquisitely done. Not because of what was shown, but how it was done - the sequential appearance of the various tissues, starting from the circulatory system, then the skeleton, nerves, muscles and skin. And the washbasin scene where water took on the outline of an invisible face was way clever. Fine, I'm a sucker for the special effects, but let's give the techno-wizards of Tinseltown the honor that is due. They don't do wonders like that just anywhere in the world.Finally, I doubt if there's a human alive that, at some point in life, has not wished for the gift of invisibility. As a boy, I envisioned all kinds of mischief under those circumstances. Unfortunately, being invisible, as HOLLOW MAN depicts, necessitates being starkers.

There is not much else to be said, except how lacking this film is in both a horrific and dramatic atmosphere. No, wait! I forgot all the other bad things about Hollow Man! Oh, well, I might as well put them into a review. Here goes!A group of scientists, led by the brilliant yet eccentric twinkle-addicted Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon), are successfully researching invisibility. Having accomplished making animals invisible, Caine insists on being the next subject for the experiment. Unfortunately, the serum effects not only the external physical nature of the subject, but morphs the internal personality too. And that's when things start to go horribly wrong...And that is also where the script and lots of other things start to go wrong in the film. Hollow Man starts promisingly, with a shocking opening scene and a thrilling gorilla chase, but it quickly puts itself down and starts to be overly-silly, using a whole bunch of original ideas to try and keep the audiences entertained, while all we're doing in our seats is yawning and trying to keep our eyes open as much as possible. The performances are awful, Elisabeth Shue is just so terrifyingly horrid in her role that she deserves a big, fat Razzie, and a gigantic knife in the back.

Would you use it to mess with friends, co-workers, and maybe even neighbors? Or would you try to get into places that you are not normally allowed to go? Or are there some of you out there that would embrace your darker desires and abuse the ability by committing wrongs against others whether they know it or not? I know for me, I would most likely use the ability to mess with others (not in a harmful way, just play tricks on them), and the temptation would be there to go into certain places where I'm not allowed to go, but I know for a fact that I wouldn't abuse the gift by hurting others directly or indirectly. In director Paul Verhoven's (""Robocop"" and ""Basic Instinct"") 2000 hit science fiction release of ""Hollow Man"" starring Kevin Bacon, Elisabeth Shue, and Josh Brolin these questions are pondered to varying degrees, and the results tend to be more sinister in nature.""Hollow Man"" is the story of a team of scientists, led by Dr. Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon), who have been commissioned by the U.S. government to create an invisibility serum. After successfully testing the serum to turn living beings invisible on animals and finally achieving the breakthrough of turning them back to visible, Caine manipulates his team into jumping head-first into human testing, namely on himself. Once the serum has turned Sebastian invisible, the remainder of his team discovers that the serum that returned the animal subjects back into visible beings doesn't work on humans. This surprising discovery leaves Caine invisible for a much longer period of time than was initially planned, and he eventually begins to believe that his co-workers, led by Sebastian's former flame (Elisabeth Shue) and her new boyfriend (Josh Brolin), are in fact trying to kill him. This realization, combined with the rationale that you can do whatever you want when you don't have to look at yourself in the mirror anymore, causes Sebastian Caine to turn on his former colleagues and begin hunting them one by one. Now, this team of ill-fated scientists find themselves in the fight of their lives against an unseen foe that is becoming increasingly dangerous and unstable.""Hollow Man"" is a slick, fast-paced sci-fi/horror movie that is very enjoyable, but loses some of its luster if you stop to think about the story too much. The story for the film is decent, though nothing spectacular by any means. I liked the way the film spent some time trying to explain the science behind the invisibility serum, and its effects on animals and their mental capacities, which made Sebastian's eventual psychosis later in the film more plausible. However, I would have preferred his descent into madness not been so sudden after he discovered that the serum to return him to being visible again may kill him. It was his rationale of believing that his co-workers were trying to kill him via the serum that made this portion of the movie seem a bit weak. There had been no indication of that intention on their behalf prior, but suddenly the serum fails and voila, they must be trying to kill me. Come on writers, a little more depth could have been given to his reasoning here, not just glossed over to start the horror aspect of the film. Even though Sebastian's reasoning was weak, the time spent showing the escalation of his pranks on fellow co-workers turning into full-blown criminal activity was very well-paced and made his eventual murderous rampage much more believable based on what his character has been shown to be capable of over the course of the film.With a script that was decent, but could have been better, ""Hollow Man"" could easily have been swept aside as being just another average sci-fi/horror hybrid that would quickly be forgotten. Fortunately for the film's financial backers the cast was comprised of top-notch stars that elevated the material above the average existence it would have had. Kevin Bacon, Elisabeth Shue, and Josh Brolin comprise the main cast for the film, and each actor/actress delivered strong performances, even handling the sci-fi techno-jargon rather convincingly. Thanks to the rather talented cast, the inadequacies of the script were somewhat forgotten, or at least not nearly as obvious to the point that they were too distracting to the viewer during the film.Finally, the most spectacular component of the film would have to be the outstanding visual effects work. Even for an eight year old film, the effects that are employed to create invisible characters are still as visually impressive today as they were the day it was released. I wonder though, if ""Hollow Man"" had been created today with the even more inflated budgets that most sci-fi movies enjoy, would the effects look any better? I tend to think that they would most likely look pretty much the same as they already do, which shows just how great the effects really look. The only place that could even remotely be improved is the sequence when Kevin Bacon turns invisible, some of the sequence looked a little fake, but then again, I haven't seen anyone with their skin invisible before to see what they look like underneath, so for all I know that may have been an accurate representation. Even if it wasn't completely accurate or realistic in appearance, it still looked impressive, so you get no real complaining from me, it was just a passing thought.In the end, ""Hollow Man"" is a visually stunning special effects extravaganza that does a good job of mixing science fiction and horror together into one film. The storyline is somewhat weak in places, and could have benefited from a bit more character development and depth to the story, but the talented actors and actresses in the film, plus the terrific visual effects, more than make up for any short-comings the story had.""Hollow Man"" is rated R for violence, language, and sexuality/nudity.",4,"You Think You're Alone, Think Again...",1204329600,"03

If you know anything, for instance: Gorillas are vegetarians; Setting a man on fire, then braining him with a crowbar then electrocuting him would kill him; you won't enjoy this movie nearly as much as if you dropped out of school at age nine.  Don't get me wrong. The performances are fine, the camera moves assuredly and the film is essentially a guidebook for editors of action films. Unfortunately, nothing in this film happens for a reason, only to set up some kind of special effects shot. The script is the culprit here; the film could have served the effects and the story, but it chose to ignore everything but the most simple plot elements.  The extras on this DVD are above average. They focus mainly on the special visual effects. If you are interested in green screen effects and how long they take to set up and shoot, you'll love this disc.

527700,AQ4NJ2T9PVI3L,B00003CXK9,"Kitten With a Whip ""kittenwithawhip""","[16, 23]","Note: This review contains minor spoilers, though there isn't much to spoil, plus you'll be doing yourself a huge favor if you read the review instead of seeing the movie.I don't think I've ever rushed this fast to give something a bad review.  Most of the other reviews say it all...but I desperately *need* to write down how bad this movie is and hopefully purge it from my system. You know, I don't ask for the impossible when I sit down to watch a movie. All I really want from a movie, at minimum, is to be entertained or to escape for 90 minutes or so. The movie started out OK but after the gorilla scene, and the two other invisible transformation scenes, it really went downhill. And got worse.Oh yeah, in case you haven't seen the trailer, or read a review, the plot is: a group of scientists is working on an invisibility formula, for the government. The leader of the project is smart, but an arrogant jerk. He 'meddles with mother nature' (a no-no in a scary movie) and deliberately deceives people who trust him (again, another mistake) so the formula can be tested on him as the first human. You'll never guess what happens then: things go horribly wrong! People turn to murder!  Disaster strikes! You waste 2 hours of your time and a rental fee because you could have just watched the trailer, which gave the whole plot away anyway!I had low expectations for this movie-all I wanted was for something to surprise me, or there to be a special effect or shock that made me watch the scene/moment again a couple times. Or at least want to. For instance, &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot; was stupid and mainly lame, but at least had that one big surprise (you know the one I mean-I won't give it away like someone did to me before I saw it). Nope.I didn't find any of the characters likable. Sorry, but I don't have too much respect for any character in a horror/thriller movie that does any of the following: 1. walks backward when they know they are in danger 2. turns their back on someone dangerous that they've conked/injured and strolls casually away without checking to see if they've really been incapacitated 3. immediately separates when they first realize they are in an isolated area being stalked by someone or 4. says something to the effect of &quot;well, I'm glad *that's* over&quot; when things obviously aren't-and if you've seen even one other scary movie, everyone knows this is always a precursor to the villain/monster immediately swooping down on them again or lunging into frame.  This movie has ALL of the above-which I could overlook if the movie was at least slightly entertaining (Bruce Campbell in any of the Evil Dead movies usually does all of the above, but makes it fun to watch, to name just one example).Also-and I see by the other reviews that I'm not alone here- I get really insulted when, especially on top of all the other crud, a villain conveniently becomes indestructible in the last half hour or so with no explanation. About every possible debilitating injury happens to him and it doesn't seem to slow him down. All that was missing was him being shot and the bullets bouncing off him.I expected there to be one interesting or memorable concept, especially since (I thought at the time) the movie had such meticulous attention to detail and seemed to take a very high-tech, scientific approach to the story. The trailers and background info on the making of this film, plus how long it took in post-production, gave me that impression. The reviews gave it more credit than it had. I was at first slightly interested in the fact that an invisible character couldn't close their eyes, because they had transparent eyelids. I never thought of that! Hmmm, maybe they came up with some other cool twists. No. That's about as inventive as it gets, and the only new idea they came up with. (then, that got shot all to hell, because about 1 minute later it occurred to me that the person could wear a sleep mask, or go in a completely blacked-out room). An invisible gorilla graphically re-materializing, layer by layer? OK, that hasn't been done before, at least not that I know of, but that's maybe 30 seconds that are slightly interesting. Let's face it, you thinking &quot;hey, good CGI&quot; occasionally is not enough to build a good movie on- in fact, it's a pretty sad statement when that's all you can say about a movie.I would run out of room if I listed even half the continuity errors. Just look at the goofs page on the IMDB. Now, I'm the type of person who people have to point out continuity errors to before I notice them. Here I noticed ones I didn't even LOOK for. What happened? Did they run out of time? Money? The studio rushed them? What's really depressing is someone probably noticed, but they either were too lacy to care or figured the audience would be so impressed with the CGI that their IQs would drop about 50 points and they'd miss it. Not to beat a dead horse, but if the movie had a character that was interesting, or if any scenes surprised me, or entertained me, I could overlook it being stupid and built around some 'ground-breaking' CGI.  Yes, I know what a 'popcorn movie/turn off your brain movie' is, where you just sit back and enjoy the mindless ride. Starship Troopers, Total Recall, Scary Movie- *those* are popcorn movies. It's also not a camp/so bad it's good type movie. Showgirls, Mommy Dearest, Glen or Glenda- those are ones you can sit and make fun of with your friends. No, instead The Hollow Man is just a waste of everyone's time and money, and that's putting it in way more polite terms than I want to.I would only recommend this if you are a CGI/FX junkie, if you thought &quot;Speed 2&quot; and &quot;The Klumps&quot; were deep, insightful masterpieces of cinema history and you didn't understand why everyone said anything bad about them, or if you really have the hots for Kevin Bacon (though skip the 'becoming invisible' scene, among others, if you don't want to get completely turned off). Interesting premise that goes absolutely nowhere.

Well anyways Hollow Man stars Elisabeth Shue, Kevin Bacon, Josh Brolin, and Kim Dickens. Kevin and his crew are scientists. They are experimenting on invisibility. They have already made a gorilla invisible and brought him back safely. Now Kevin wants to take it a step further. He volunteers to be the first subject. He does become invisible, but when they give him the antidote, they realize that they cannot bring him back due to his body functions.As the days grow, Kevin becomes more psychotic. He goes out in the middle of the night and comes back 12 or even 24 hours later. He loves having the power that no one can see him and that he does not want to be cured, and starts to do some really bad things!

It is really a modern day version of a mad scientist movie.The plot is a little thin. It basically revolves around Kevin Bacon's character, Dr. Sebastian Caine, an egotistical, self absorbed scientific genius who, during the course of his work for the Department of Defense, has managed to render animals to an invisible state and return them to visibility. He does not reveal to the Department of Defense, his financial benefactor, that his work has succeeded. Instead, he ignores protocols and decides that the time has come to take his experimentation to the next level and try it on a human being, himself.To make a long story short, Caine goes ahead with the human experimentation, only to find that he is unable to replicate the success he had with the laboratory animals and render himself visible again, once rendered invisible. He begins to deteriorate mentally, sinking into an inexplicable and bizarre maniacal state until he is totally out of control.Moreover, Caine, the acknowledged genius of a scientific assemblage, is aware that he is losing it. Yet, he does nothing to assist in the discovery of what went wrong with the experiment and what could be done to correct the problem. He, instead, inexplicably leaves the solution to the self-acknowledged lesser capabilities of his colleagues. This simply does not compute with the film's portrayal of Caine's inherent character.There is virtually no explanation for Bacon's rapid descent into apparent madness, where his antics range from naughty and not nice to totally evil and depraved. This is a big hole in the story, and Bacon's character reflects this omission, as the viewer is not moved to feel any compassion for him. The character of Caine is, in essence, just a mechanism used to facilitate a lot of action scenes with great special effects.Therein lies the rub. Caine, as a character, has no redeeming value or quality. In other words he is no Jekyll and Hyde. He is just Hyde. This is why, I believe the movie has been so panned by most viewers, even though they may not have articulated it as such.With such great visual effects, I am also surprised that more attention was not paid to production details. A latex mask created for Caine does not appear to have breathing holes for the nostrils. The film also occasionally segues into the absurd. In one scene, the ease with which plastic bags of blood were ripped open with one character's bare hands defied reality. I have a harder time ripping open a plastic bag of carrots. In another scene, Caine's character is torched with a flame thrower over, and over, and over again. Yet, like the energizer bunny, he keeps on going. This was simply not believable. The film is fraught with a number of moments of implausibility.If you are willing to suspend belief and just sit back and accept the movie at face value, however, one should stll be able to reasonably enjoy this movie, as it does, despite the plot holes, have its moments, and the visual effects are dazzling.",3,SHORT ON PLOT AND CHARACTERIZATION BUT DAZZLING VISUAL EFFECTS...,1161820800,"10 26, 2006",2006,3067,"['reasonably', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'stunning', 'visual', 'effects', 'really', 'modern', 'day', 'version', 'mad', 'scientist', 'movie.The', 'plot', 'little', 'thin', 'basically', 'around', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'character', 'Dr.', 'Sebastian', 'Caine', 'egotistical', 'self', 'absorbed', 'scientific', 'genius', 'who', 'course', 'work', 'Department', 'Defense', 'managed', 'render', 'animals', 'invisible', 'state', 'return', 'visibility', 'not', 'reveal', 'Department', 'Defense', 'financial', 'benefactor', 'work', 'succeeded', 'Instead', 'protocols', 'decides', 'time', 'come', 'take', 'experimentation', 'next', 'level', 'try', 'human', 'being', 'himself.To', 'make', 'long', 'story', 'short', 'Caine', 'ahead', 'human', 'experimentation', 'only', 'find', 'unable', 'replicate', 'success', 'had', 'laboratory', 'animals', 'render', 'visible', 'again', 'once', 'rendered', 'invisible', 'deteriorate', 'mentally', 'sinking', 'inexplicable', 'bizarre', 'maniacal', 'state', 'totally', 'control.Moreover', 'Caine', 'acknowledged', 'genius', 'scientific', 'assemblage', 'aware', 'losing', 'nothing', 'assist', 'discovery', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'experiment', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'done', 'correct', 'problem', 'instead', 'inexplicably', 'solution', 'self-acknowledged', 'lesser', 'capabilities', 'colleagues', 'simply', 'not', 'compute', 'film', 'portrayal', 'Caine', 'inherent', 'character.There', 'virtually', 'explanation', 'Bacon', 'rapid', 'descent', 'apparent', 'madness', 'where', 'antics', 'range', 'naughty', 'not', 'nice', 'totally', 'evil', 'depraved', 'big', 'hole', 'story', 'Bacon', 'character', 'omission', 'viewer', 'not', 'moved', 'feel', 'compassion', 'character', 'Caine', 'essence', 'just', 'mechanism', 'used', 'facilitate', 'lot', 'action', 'scenes', 'great', 'special', 'effects.Therein', 'rub', 'Caine', 'character', 'redeeming', 'value', 'quality', 'other', 'words', 'Jekyll', 'Hyde', 'just', 'Hyde', 'why', 'believe', 'movie', 'been', 'so', 'panned', 'most', 'viewers', 'even', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'articulated', 'such.With', 'such', 'great', 'visual', 'effects', 'am', 'also', 'surprised', 'more', 'attention', 'was', 'not', 'paid', 'production', 'details', 'latex', 'mask', 'created', 'Caine', 'not', 'appear', 'have', 'breathing', 'holes', 'nostrils', 'film', 'also', 'occasionally', 'absurd', 'one', 'scene', 'ease', 'plastic', 'bags', 'blood', 'were', 'ripped', 'open', 'one', 'character', 'bare', 'hands', 'defied', 'reality', 'have', 'harder', 'time', 'ripping', 'open', 'plastic', 'bag', 'carrots', 'scene', 'Caine', 'character', 'torched', 'flame', 'thrower', 'over', 'again', 'energizer', 'bunny', 'going', 'was', 'simply', 'not', 'believable', 'film', 'fraught', 'number', 'moments', 'implausibility.If', 'are', 'willing', 'suspend', 'belief', 'just', 'sit', 'back', 'accept', 'movie', 'face', 'value', 'however', 'one', 'should', 'stll', 'be', 'able', 'reasonably', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'plot', 'holes', 'have', 'moments', 'visual', 'effects', 'are', 'dazzling']",N/A

After the first thirty minutes or so, after Kevin Bacon's character, Sebastian, is turned invisible, the film goes downhill, degenerating into a standard run around thriller.  It's not that the movie is actually all that bad, but it could have been so much more if anyone had really thought about what they were doing and was more interested in telling a story than in using special effects just to show us what they could do.Granted, I could possibly see how being turned invisible could affect your mind, and even eventually turn you psychotic, but it just happens so fast in this movie, almost from the get go.  There had to have already been problems going on in Dr. Sebastian's mind for him to snap so fast, and the reasoning behind him going so ballistic, seeing his former lover and another colleague in bed together, seems so asinine.  Especially since he'd already been running slightly amok, using his invisibility to open another colleagues blouse as she slept, and attacking his next door neighbor because he was sexually attracted to her.I would also like to know how becoming invisible also turned Sebastian into such a superman.  We see him getting blasted by steam, he's burned bad enough to turn someone into a barbecue, clobbered with a large crowbar, and electrocuted, but like the energizer bunny, he keeps on going.  Ludicrous, how could the makers of this film possibly expect us to buy into this?

The art of computer generated images [CGI] is advancing rapidly. The line between what is real and what is a computer graphic is becoming quite blurred, and I am in awe of this technology. Some things in life remain the same, however, and the need for a good, coherent storyline is one of them. Hollow Man lacks this, and, as a result, the movie is just so-so.Much of the movie takes place in a secret government lab deep below the surface of Washington, DC. There, a team of scientists, led by Sebastian Caine [Kevin Bacon] has almost perfected a process which renders people and other mammals invisible. Caine convinces two other workers, Linda and Matthew [Elizabeth Shue and Josh Brolin], to proceed with a test on a human being, namely Caine himself. The Pentagon doesn't know about this, but the trio doesn't tell this to the rest of the crew. The experiment proceeds. Caine becomes invisible, but the antidote fails. The group must then figure out what went wrong so that they can make Caine visible again. As time drags on, Caine, a volatile, egocentric guy even before the experoment, becomes increasingly unstable. Very bad things begin to occur.The people who made Hollow Man do not seem to have the imagination to explore the subject of becoming invisible very far. That's a shame, because the possibilities are virtually endless. What's worse, they don't have much feel for either drama or comedy. It's always dangerous when filmmakers take shallow ideas and get serious about them. In this case, Caine was once Linda's lover, but she wisely dumped him. Now Matthew is her lover, but she doesn't want Caine to find out, even though the three spend about eighteen hours a day working together. How interesting or original is that for a plot idea? In a place where some mammals are invisible and others aren't, there are lots of setups for comedy. Hollow Man makes use of none of them. So short on ideas were director Paul Verhoeven and his crew that the movie turns into a slasher flick for no good reason other than that Caine seems to be having a bad week.The CGI effects truly are wondrous, and they make the movie worth watching, at least for technophiles. The ways in which we see Caine are ingenious. The scene in which he turns invisible is amazing.One area of the movie's script truly annoyed me. Every main character is either a scientist or a doctor, hand picked for their genius and intelligence. Just consider the scope of their project. Yet most of them are rarely able to utter a complete sentence. Much worse, none of them can say more than a dozen words without using a four-letter word. As an ardent supporter of freedom of speech, I do not note this out of any moral sense.

Although this topic has been portrayed in numerous movies, TV programs, and comic books, &quot;Hollow Man&quot; distinguishes itself with a combination of cutting edge special effects and menacing thrills. Kevin Bacon plays the film's main character, Dr. Sebastian Caine--whose name struck me as a subtle biblical reference to the &quot;mark of Cain&quot; (Genesis 4:15)The effects are truly the star of the film, and the filmmakers exploit the invisibility motif in many memorable scenes. Sequences such as a hunt for an invisible escaped gorilla are shot with flair. Good production values add to the film's visual appeal: every would-be &quot;mad scientist&quot; would drool over the high-tech laboratory created for Dr. Caine. But be forewarned: the film's gory violence may not be suitable for all viewers.The only real flaw of the film lies in the characterizations. Bacon's Dr. Caine is an unlikeable, arrogant creep who shows his disregard for both human and animal life from his first scenes. The film's one almost sympathetic character, a soft-hearted veterinarian, is whiny and annoying. As a result, I found myself not caring much for any of these characters.

So Animals can disappear, and people have to use thermal glasses to see them. Then they get brought back to there regular normal phase. And Then Kevin Bacon decides he wants to try it. Basically Hollow Man is an updated version of The Invisible Man.  Hollow Man was called &quot;I Know What You Did In the Lab this Summer&quot; And that is pretty on the dot. Elizabeth Shue plays Kevin Bacons former love, and colleague. Josh Brolin plays Shues current love and colleague. I will have to say that Hollow Man is a little wittier then the completely routine slasher films such as Urban Legends: Final Cut. I'm not sure if it should have been a slasher film, but it turned out to be.  Bacon basically locks everyone in the lab and starts stalking in a high gore fashion, you know the usual impaling and slicing and dicing. To Be honest, I don't  it was intended to be a slasher film, but it turns out to be one. It has some good suspense and is a great deal Scarier than Urban Legends: Final Cut, but that isn't saying much though, since that movie WAS NOT Scary!!.  Hollow Man is a visual feast, and has some much needed wit to it. The ones being stalked are a little smarter than the 'stupid blond running from a mad slasher, even though he is catching up to her, and he is walking' but still make the same stupid mistakes.  Kevin Bacon gets to play a bad guy, instead of a good guy. I sincerely think he should stick to the good guys. It isn't he is bad, it is just a waste of his time., and talent.  Hollywood still hasn't figured out that nothing is scarier than everything. That probably doesn't make since so here is an example 'The Blair Witch Project' was 5 times scarier than Hollow Man and Hollow Man is 3 times scarier than Urban Legend 2. The Blair Witch had no killer, no stalker no witch. The sense on the witch was scarier. And Urban Legend 2 had the stalker, insulting gore, and bad acting.  Since Hollow Man was gory it wasn't to scary, but it did get a better review from me because there were times you couldn't see anything you only could sense the trouble, and that is a good thing.",3,"Incredible Special effects, but turns stupid.",981331200,"02 5, 2001",2001,2192,"['Brilliant', 'scientist', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'discovered', 'way', 'bring', 'people', 'back', 'form', 'invisibility', 'Animals', 'can', 'disappear', 'people', 'have', 'use', 'thermal', 'glasses', 'see', 'Then', 'get', 'brought', 'back', 'regular', 'normal', 'phase', 'Then', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'try', 'Basically', 'Hollow', 'Man', 'updated', 'version', 'Invisible', 'Man', 'Hollow', 'Man', 'was', 'called', 'quot', 'Know', 'What', 'Did', 'Lab', 'Summer', 'quot', 'pretty', 'dot', 'Elizabeth', 'Shue', 'Kevin', 'Bacons', 'former', 'love', 'colleague', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'Shues', 'current', 'love', 'colleague', 'will', 'have', 'say', 'Hollow', 'Man', 'little', 'wittier', 'then', 'completely', 'routine', 'slasher', 'films', 'such', 'Urban', 'Legends', 'Final', 'Cut', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'slasher', 'film', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'Bacon', 'basically', 'everyone', 'lab', 'stalking', 'high', 'gore', 'fashion', 'know', 'usual', 'impaling', 'slicing', 'dicing', 'Be', 'honest', 'do', ""n't"", 'was', 'intended', 'be', 'slasher', 'film', 'out', 'be', 'one', 'good', 'suspense', 'great', 'deal', 'Scarier', 'Urban', 'Legends', 'Final', 'Cut', ""n't"", 'saying', 'much', 'movie', 'WAS', 'NOT', 'Scary', 'Hollow', 'Man', 'visual', 'feast', 'much', 'needed', 'wit', 'ones', 'being', 'stalked', 'are', 'little', 'smarter', ""'stupid"", 'blond', 'running', 'mad', 'slasher', 'even', 'catching', 'up', 'walking', 'still', 'make', 'same', 'stupid', 'mistakes', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'play', 'bad', 'guy', 'instead', 'good', 'guy', 'sincerely', 'think', 'should', 'stick', 'good', 'guys', ""n't"", 'bad', 'just', 'waste', 'time.', 'talent', 'Hollywood', 'still', ""n't"", 'figured', 'out', 'nothing', 'scarier', 'everything', 'probably', ""n't"", 'make', 'so', 'here', 'example', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'was', '5', 'times', 'scarier', 'Hollow', 'Man', 'Hollow', 'Man', '3', 'times', 'scarier', 'Urban', 'Legend', '2', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'had', 'killer', 'stalker', 'witch', 'sense', 'witch', 'was', 'scarier', 'Urban', 'Legend', '2', 'had', 'stalker', 'insulting', 'gore', 'bad', 'acting', 'Hollow', 'Man', 'was', 'gory', 'was', ""n't"", 'scary', 'did', 'get', 'better', 'review', 'were', 'times', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'only', 'could', 'sense', 'trouble', 'good', 'thing']",N/A

527721,AB5DVSNPX1JSK,B00003CXK9,"Mr. Fisher ""grand_clown""","[7, 10]","Hollow Man was a film that got plenty of commercial time.  I remember its previews, and to be honest, it looked appealing.  Ah, but looks can be deceiving.  It looked like a pretty fascinating horror movie, worth seeing, that maybe it would have some depth and avoid the cheezy mistakes of past horror flicks.  The idea of an invisable man, creating havoc, intrigued me.  So I saw it.  My analysis is that this is a huge disappointment.  The ultimate let down when it comes to potential.Kevin Bacon is a fine actor, I like him, I really do.  He makes a good hero and villain, and in this one he plays the villain.  He plays Dr. Caine, who turns out to be this reckless, arrogant mad scientist who breaks rules to break ground.  Fine, this is a good character that we can follow.  His ultimate dream, project if you will, is to create invisibility.  So after many animal experiments, he decides to test it, with him as the guinea pig.  Well it works, he's invisible, but he can't change back.  And as it turns out, he doesn't want to.This is good, but where the potential is dropped is when Sebastian Caine goes berserk.  There really is no reason established in this movie why he suddenly turns to evil and does these murderous, mischievous deeds.  The question ""why"" kept popping into my head during this movie.  I suppose it could be answered that he loved the power of invisibility and never wanted to share it or give it up to anyone else.  Or his envy and jealousy got the better of him.  But this didn't work for me, there needed to be a better reason on why he snapped.Elisabeth Shue was Sebastian's girlfriend, now is his best buddy's girlfriend, which is where the envy and jealousy comes from.  What I felt would've been better to create the motive was not have the movie start out with Shue being the ex to Sebastian but to have them still be together.  Then have her dump him for the better man.  Soap operish, I know, but at least it gives us a better motive.Well, you already know the plot, he goes berserk towards the second half of the film.  He molests some pretty young woman in her apartment, then becomes aggressive with Shue, he's rude and utterly evil.  Then he decides he's sick of everyone and he's going to kill them all.  So one by one he hunts each of the team members who work on his project down.  Again, this all came on suddenly.  This film lacks understandment to why Sebastian mutated from this over zealous scientiest into this demonic madman.  He just turns with no real motive.  The plot would be fine if it just gives us a clear and definate reason to why Sebastian turns into this villain.I thought the special effects were OK, maybe a bit over done.  When he starts becoming invisible, we see his muscles and then his skeleton as he's transforming.  This didn't look very real, it is so clearly recognizable as computer generated effects.  It looked more cartoon like and therefore I wasn't very impressed with the transformation.  I did like it whenever somebody threw something on him to visualize him.  That seemed real and quite believable.But you know what bugged me the most about this movie?  Despite the sudden switch in Sebastian, despite the failure of potential to enhance the plot, the real issue with this movie is that it's just like all the other corny horror movies out there.  It's got the corny lines, the cheap suspense, the typical ending, and the typical ""take forever to die monster"" formula.I mean come on, how many horror movies have we seen where it takes forever for the bad guy to die?  First Shue torches him with a blow torch, practically reducing him to standing ash.  But yet, he's as strong as ever and still alive and still standing!  No freaking way!  Then he gets electrocuted and yet he's still alive and strong as ever!  Then he climbs up a ladder, all burnt and fried, trying to get Shue only to get torched again this time for good.  I mean, how corny.  Just die, man.If this movie had ended it with a more thought provoking, dramatic, maybe even sympathizing fashion we might appreciate this movie a whole lot more.  But because it had to end with cheese, this film does not separate itself from the 1950's ""screamers"" or the 1980's ""blood and guts"" horror flicks.

As the days go by Sabastian goes a little crazy, he finds it hard to sleep because his eye lids are transperent. Getting a little bit bored being trapped in the lab he desides to go outside.  Pretty soon he goes a little bit more crazy and traps the other scientest inside the lab and begins to kill them off one by one.  Ok, the one thing I can honestly say is I tried HARD to enjoy The Hollow Man, I thought it had a great idea and the effects where amazing but the effects are probably one of the only things good in the movie.  The movie gets very boring very fast. It takes at least a good hour before something finally happens and when it does happen it is very predictable. You always know where the invisable man is going to come out from, there is really no suprises. Also there is no real gore in this movie either,  the deaths are pretty dull except for one or two and Sabastian seems to be immortal, it's hard to beleive he survives as much as he does.

Instead of robbing a bank, he  tweaks the nipples of the project veterinarian.  Rather than murder Saddam  Hussein, he rapes the woman in the apartment across the hall.

527734,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00003CXK9,Reviewer,"[2, 4]","Within the realm of Science Fiction, two particular themes consistently elicit interest, were initially explored in the literature of a pre-cinematic era, and have since been periodically revisited by filmmakers and writers alike, with varying degrees of success.  The first theme, that of time travel, has held an unwavering fascination for fans of film, as well as the written word, most recently on the screen with yet another version of the H.G. Wells classic, ""The Time Machine.""  The second theme, which also manages to hold audiences in thrall, is that of invisibility, which sparks the imagination with it's seemingly endless and myriad possibilities.  And this theme, too, has again become the basis for a film adapted from another H.G. Wells classic, ""The Invisible Man,"" the realization of which, here, is ""Hollow Man,"" directed by Paul Verhoeven, and starring Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue.Sebastian Caine (Bacon) and his colleagues have for some time been conducting experiments for the U.S. Government, exploring the possibility and practicality of invisibility, which they have, at last, achieved in a number of the primates upon which they have tested their method.  They have, in fact, progressed to the point that effecting the invisibility is assured; their only problem now is bringing the subject back to the original ""visual"" state of being.  It's a problem, however,  that Caine, after diligent effort and too many hours in the lab, has solved-- or so he thinks.  And when the application of his theory on a live subject is successful, he decides to present the results to the board of directors, in an effort to thereby maintain the funding necessary for the continuation of the project.At the last minute, though, Caine demurs, fearing that control of the project will be wrested from him before they can proceed to the next level-- the testing of a human subject.  And he takes it upon himself to become that subject, securing the assistance of his research team by telling them that they've been given approval by the board to do so.  But something goes wrong, and Caine becomes trapped in his cloak of invisibility; and as he and his team struggle to find the solution to his considerable dilemma before it's too late, it all begins to take a toll on Caine's mind.  And suddenly, his fear of losing funding and control becomes inconsequential, as he finds himself facing the imminent danger of losing much more than that.  Now there's a very real chance that he may lose everything-- Including himself.Verhoeven has crafted what is initially an exciting, even thought provoking film; he establishes a good pace and uses the F/X at his disposal to great effect, though he does tend to allow the striking visuals to overwhelm the character development.  Anyone familiar with ""The Invisible Man,"" or actually anyone who can logically follow the progression of the story, will know early on that Caine is not destined for happier times.  Still, Verhoeven has a style of storytelling that is definitely going to capture the attention and engage his audience.  But he seems bent on rushing toward the climax, and along the way he abandons any and all of the nuance that has made his film thus far successful, opting to enter into a final sequence that is nothing more than a mindless blood-and-gore fest that betrays his audience and everything he's worked for earlier in the film.  Rather than seeking an intelligent resolution to Caine's suffering, and using some inventiveness and imagination to take the film to it's inevitable conclusion, Verhoeven takes the low road, and though it may succeed on a purely visceral level, any meaning one could derive from the story dissolves like so many ashes in the wind, along with anything that would have made this a memorable film.  And it's a shame, because Verhoeven has it at a higher level than much of what is offered in this genre, and he allows it to sink unnecessarily to one much lower.Kevin Bacon does a good job of creating a character that is believable, if only on the surface, which seemingly serves Verhoeven's purposes perfectly.  There's little depth to Bacon's portrayal, but it has more to do with his director's agenda than his own acting abilities.  Verhoeven simply does not allow Bacon the time to develop Caine to any extent; the character is mainly a vessel around which Verhoeven can build his story, and toward that end, it works.  The film would have been better served, however, had Verhoeven and Bacon collaborated more closely on at least developing a bond between Caine and the audience that would have prompted some emotional involvement on the viewers part, something that would have drawn them in a bit, rather than leaving them at the gate, as it were, as mere observers of an F/X laden extravaganza.Elisabeth Shue comports herself well in the role of Linda McKay, Caine's willing accomplice in the ill-fated experiment, but it's basically a thankless part that offers little challenge, especially to an actor of Shue's caliber.  The same can be said of Kim Dickens (so magnificent in the 2001 film, ""Things Behind the Sun"").  Her character, Sarah Kennedy, does little more than support the action and F/X.  Both actors are capable of so much more, and deserve better than what they are given to work with here.The supporting cast includes Josh Brolin (Matthew), Greg Grunberg (Carter), Joey Slotnick (Frank), Mary Randle (Janice) and William Devane (Dr. Kramer).  Entertaining to a point, and even successful on a certain (low) level, ""Hollow Man"" is one of those films that leaves you contemplating what could have been.  Like an annual fireworks display, it will give you some momentary thrills, but after awhile it'll begin to blend in with all the others you've seen, without anything special to set it apart.  And it's too bad, because given the talent and abilities of those involved here, it could have been so much more.",2,"Bacon Has Done Better, Much Better",1025654400,"07 3, 2002",2002,5934,"['realm',

527739,A2YX9VMOSROGOZ,B00003CXK9,RM,"[4, 7]","Ok, I personally loved this movie. It has a good cast, good acting and a good storyline. The SFX are amazing but that isn't the only thing that this movie has going for it. The story is about a group of scientists who are experimenting in making animals invisible. The procedure works and finally Kevin Bacon (Sebastian Caine) and his crew decide to try the procedure on humans, without informing the Pentagon about it.Caine volunteers to be the test subject and although they were able to bring a gorilla back from invisibility, they have problems doing it with Sebastian. The side effects begin to manifest themselves over an extended period of time, much of it to do with sexual frustration. So, Sebastian starts doing a little ""experimentation"" of his own on the female members of his crew, including his former girlfriend. His anger starts to become more and more apparent and uncontrolled as his crew is unable to reverse the procedure.Finally, he finds out that his former girlfriend, who he still adores, is going steady with another member of his science team. He explodes with anger and begins to take his revenge out on the crew. He also says a very memorable quote:""It's amazing what you can do when you no longer have to look at yourself in the mirror"" What I think this movie also does, is raise some interesting moral questions for us, as an audience. Would we also behave in a similar manner i.e. become sexually frustrated and behave violently, knowing that we are, more or less, omnipotent?The title of this movie I also found to be so appropriate. In the obvious, physical sense, ""hollow"" as in empty or void but also in the moral and spiritual sense. Kevin Bacon's character clearly has no morals and his character begins to lack any substance as the film progresses. His love for his former girlfriend becomes more and more a primitive, sexual urge, rather than genuine affection. Nice DVD extras, too.Well, there you have it.

527740,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00003CXK9,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 6]","Hollow Man (Paul Verhoeven, 2000)Why, exactly, anyone lets Paul Verhoeven make movies in Hollywood anymore is completely beyond me. Sure, Verhoeven made the cult hit RoboCop (but really, it wasn't all that good a movie), and the Arnold Schwarzenegger money machine Total Recall. But in the world of ""what have you done for me lately,"" why isn't he remembered for Showgirls? Well, the nodding heads in Hollywood haven't green-lighted anything for the guy since Hollow Man, so maybe things are looking up.Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Caine, your typical mad scientist who, after a whole lot of setup, turns invisible. (No, this isn't a plot spoiler. It was the basis of every trailer released for the movie, despite it having been intended, we assume, as a big plot twist). With a team of assorted misfits, Caine has been working on a secret government invisibility project headed up by one of Caine's old professors, Howard Kramer (William Devane, showing just how far a career can fall in a few short years). Caine, being the megalomaniac scientist he of course is, uses himself as a test subject, and, well, when you make a nasty person invisible... I think you can guess the rest.First off, remember the flap after Showgirls, when Verhoeven and Esterhasz split, supposedly because Esterhasz was writing scripts too misogynist for Verhoeven? Here's all the proof you could possibly need that it was all a load. Verhoeven and new golden-boy screenwriters Gary Thompson (of the timeless script for The Fast and the Furious) and Andrew W. Marlowe (the even more timeless script for End of Days) do far more female-menacing in this movie than Esterhasz did in any two of his. There's all the usual reactionary stuff one expects from your basic genre film. Linda McKay (Elisabeth Shue of Leaving Las Vegas fame), Caine's ex, is now in bed with their other best friend and partner Matt Kensington (Josh Brolin, whose career has gone... well, from The Goonies to here. You do the math). In other words, hmmm, office relationships are a bad thing. Thanks for pointing that out, guys. There's more of a team (mentioned only so I can say ""Joey Slotnick left Boston Public to pursue a movie career... for this? Best decision since David Caruso left NYPD Blue to make Jade), but they're essentially living blood dolls. And with most of the acting in this movie, you end up betting on ""not if, but when.""Like the movie it completely rips off, The Invisible Man, Hollow Man was made pretty much for the purpose of spending a really big special effects budget. And the effects, for what it's worth, are pretty darn cool. In one of the opening scenes, Caine and his team are testing the invisibility potion on an ape, and they bring the ape back to visibility. Very cool stuff. (Of course, unlike 1933, the way to work in Hollywood today is ""if it looks good, overuse it."" So if you miss the ape scene `cause you're already bored enough to be in the bathroom, don't worry.) Also unlike 1933, it would seem that Hollywood doesn't require things like a decent plot to spend said special effects budget. So if you're looking for a movie where a lot of things go boom (for unrealistic lengths of time, though the big last boom was rather inventive) and a lot of people go squish, Hollow Man will be right up your alley. If you want plot, characterization, intelligence, and real chills, you're probably better off ranting something made by Dario Argento. * ",2,Good effects.

527742,AW3FTPCBPVQNB,B00003CXK9,Robert J. Schneider,"[1, 3]","Paul Verhoeven's HOLLOW MAN is not great cinema, granted; however, one could see that from the trailer that it was going to be a pumped-up, amped-up, sci-fi action thriller with incredible (and I do mean incredible) special effects--and on those counts, it delivers big.The point of this film isn't character development (although I agree that it would have helped); indeed, when the first transformation scene took place, I was ready for the action to happen. Maybe it was all the bad press that I've read/heard since its theatrical release, but my expectations were set mainly for spectacle, not story. On that note, this film did not disappoint.Kevin Bacon gives a very good performance. He is the right type of actor for this role; with his subtle facial expressions in the early sections of the film, he gives you an idea of certain feelings lurking beneath the surface, beyond what his character expresses in words. He is thusly able to overcome some of the deficiences in the script, which tends to paint with (very) broad strokes.  Elizabeth Shue, oddly receiving first billing, is the dependable center of the action. Bad haircut or not, it's good to see her in anything these days.  Josh Brolin (looking more &amp; more like his Dad James did in his prime), does well in his rather sympathetic role.Whatever you want to say about Paul Verhoeven, ya gotta admit that he is the undisputed master of the futuristic sci-fi thriller.  After TOTAL RECALL and STARSHIP TROOPERS, he comes out with another film that employs cutting-edge visual effects.

Zwick,"[2, 3]","What would you do if you knew you could do anything you wanted to utterly secure in the knowledge that there could be no eyewitness to your actions?  Or, stated in more universal terms, are we humans really innately good and moral beings, concerned with the well being of the fellow members of our species?  Or are we merely held back from acting out our base primal urges for evil and destruction through fear of detection and punishment?  This intriguing premise serves as the basis for ""Hollow Man,"" a sci-fi thriller that, initially at least, toys with some of these deeper themes yet, like so many big budget action films, ultimately yields to incredibility, preposterousness, and over-the-top sensationalism.A movie like ""Hollow Man"" provides a rather unique opportunity for a lead actor - in this case, Kevin Bacon - in that he probably only appears on screen for about a third of the duration of the film.  It is probably the skimpiest lead role in movie history, since most of the rest of the time he merely needs to contribute voice over assistance or appear behind a hollowed out rubber mask.Credit the filmmakers with at least having the courage to present a rather desipicable character as their protagonist.  Yet, even in its initial stages, when it appears as if it might actually explore the more metaphorical aspects of the title and examine the hollowness within the central figure himself, the film still suffers from both credibility gaps and lapses in logic.  We are supposed to believe, for instance, that the Pentagon would be willing to fund this ragtag collection of babes and hunks masquerading as serious scientists in their research into invisibility - though the purpose for the Pentagon's interest in the experiment is never adequately explained to us.  None of the researchers seem as if they will be pushing middle age anytime soon and Bacon's character, Sebastian Caine, is particularly unconvincing as the ""genius"" he is purported to be since he never utters a single observation whose profundity would challenge the average junior high school student teetering on the verge of puberty.  In fact, Caine, when he isn't trumpeting his own accomplishments to a rather unappreciative world, can be found peering lustfully through the blinds at the very sexy neighbor across the alley.  This tendency towards voyeurism sets the character up for some profound possibilities once he himself turns invisible, yet after a few halfhearted thrusts in that direction, the filmmakers end up locking all the characters into the laboratory while a by-now-crazed Caine attempts to knock them all off one by one.  This is where the movie really falls apart.  The filmmakers - writers Gary Scott Thompson and Andrew W. Marlowe along with the normally gifted director Paul Verhoeven - lose all control of the potentially intriguing themes they have hitherto set up and spend the last hour or so piling on one action movie clich&eacute; and character inanity after another.  Why make a movie about an invisible man if you don't intend to do anything interesting with it?  By the end, ""Hollow Man"" begins to feel like just the latest variant on the ""Alien"" movies, ""Deep Blue Sea,"" ""The Thing"" and countless other films wherein a group of people are trapped and being hunted by a force with superior powers.Another flaw:  how is Caine, in his invisible state, able to move around so soundlessly?  People do make noise when they move and it seems unlikely that Caine's presence would really be all that hard to detect.Elisabeth Shue, Josh Brolin, Kim Dickens and others in the cast aren't given much of an opportunity to exercise their acting muscles - and, unlike Bacon, they are not afforded the option of blanking themselves into invisibility for the duration.  Considering the results on screen, Bacon just might be a genius after all!A special note:  while I was viewing this film at home, someone knocked on my front door - and, guess what, there was no one there!

527745,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B00003CXK9,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[0, 1]","Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) is a brilliant but evil scientist.  With that european surname, he's the kind of evil scientist you'd expect to find in a movie by Paul Verhoeven - he's into rough sex, voyeurism, junk food, fast cars and self-deification.  Unfortunately, he's also working on developing a radioactive serum that turns living matter invisible.  While animals have been able to shift from invisibility and back again, Caine finds himself stuck when he impulsively has himself injected.  Never a nice guy, the prolonged invisibility turns Caine predatory at first, then sociopathic and finally homicidal.  A further complication - the project is funded by some covert arm of the government which stymies attempts to reign Caine in when he starts showing his true self.  It also requires that the team work out of a high-tech looking underground complex - where Caine traps the project members and sets the stage for a hyperviolent climactic duel of wits.While the flick has some great effects, but the weak story and uneven pacing kill it.  Even the effects lose their bite when the movie tries to hang everything it has onto them when the deficiencies in plot and charahcter are too obvious.

Here's the thing: I *love* the concept of the Invisible Man for a horror movie.  It lends itself to perfect, Hitchcockian suspense: you just point the camera at a person alone in their room, doing ordinary things, and the audience will go out of their minds wondering if that person is as alone as they appear to be.  No special effects whatsoever are necessary.  &quot;Hollow Man&quot; by contrast, has some really amazing special effects.  I will give it that much, but so what?  The whole point of having an invisible man is not knowing where he will be at a given time.  This movie actually goes to great pains to make damn sure you know exactly where Kevin Bacon is at all times, and left me wondering why invisibility, specifically, was the plot device.

Welsh,"[2, 2]","I should lay my cards on the table and admit that I thoroughly dislike Paul Verhoeven's films (well certainly ""Starship Troopers"" and ""Total Recall"" - who else could ruin a Heinlein and a PKD?) I think his approach to making films is condescending, meretricious, and cynical; and I don't relish being patronised.""Hollow Man"" displays all the standard symptoms of advanced Verhoeven Syndrome: shallow plot, no character development, gratuitous violence, and a contempt for the laws of science that almost amounts to an organised campaign to subvert SF as a genre. Witness the dramatic idea (stolen directly from H.G. Wells, of course) of making animals and human beings completely invisible, without the slightest shred of scientific explanation except for some mumbo-jumbo about quantum shifts. Making organisms vanish is done by injecting them with a lurid orange liquid injected from an immense hypodermic that looks like a Fisher-Price toy (but only after it's been ""irradiated""). Making the creatures visible again calls for the identical process - but this time with a bright blue liquid! (I'm not making this up, honest, although I might have got the colours transposed).Bacon, who acts as brilliantly as usual, is represented as not too tightly wrapped at the best of times, and when his cunning plan to become world-famous by being the first human to vanish and reappear goes pear-shaped, he sulks and then goes psycho. Cue an outbreak of picturesque violence loaded with themes stolen from here, there, and everywhere - music reminiscent of ""Predator"", hidden menaces like those in ""Aliens"", and of course a huge explosion that hurls a fireball up a lift shaft after Shue and Brolin like those in every other ""thriller"" for years. Naturally the fire almost catches them, washing over Shue's legs without crisping them or even, indeed, giving her mild sunburn. (The same explosion hurls the lift itself clean past them faster than a BMW on the M40, but there seems to be no shock wave at all). The fireball recedes down the shaft but remains on active duty, chuntering quietly to itself, ready to consume Bacon's body as he hurtles back down (whoops, sorry, spoiler, but some things really can't be spoiled any more than they already are). Brolin is run clean through the guts by some sharp metal object, then semi-frozen, and seems to be at death's door - after which he runs, fights, climbs about a hundred yards of vertical steel ladder, falls a few yards onto a roof, fights some more, and is last seen walking away quite normally, arm-in-arm with Shue.Yet, even as you wonder what second-hand trick or stunt will come next, you have to admire the acting and even the psychological insight of it all. How many of us have known bosses like the nut-case Bacon depicts? Fortunately, your boss probably can't make himself invisible in order to stalk you - yet, anyway.

A driven, eccentric scientist (Kevin Bacon) carries out an elaborate and risky experiment, in which he uses himself as a guinea-pig in order to acquire the power of being invisible. He unexpectedly puts his new ability into violent and amoral uses, in an orgy of murder and revenge against enemies, as well as some of his colleagues who thwarted, opposed, or underestimated him.

527771,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00003CXK9,trebe,"[3, 3]","Kind of a modern take on the invisible man, the science fiction thriller Hollow Man (2000) follows a team of scientists developing a cutting edge technology, which eventually leads down a dark and violent road.  Paul Verhoeven (Basic Instinct, Starship Troopers, Robocop, Total Recall) capably directs what is basically a mad scientist creating a monster tale.  Hollow Man combines a B-movie storyline with absolutely first class production values, and breathtaking special effects, that are still impressive today.  The movie takes some time to explore the situation, before it goes berserk and becomes an action thriller overdriven with special effects.Dr. Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) has developed a serum that has successfully rendered animal subjects invisible.  With the help of his team headed by doctors Linda McKay (Elisabeth Shue) and Matt Kensington (Josh Brolin), Caine makes a breakthrough, successfully restoring an invisible gorilla.Working on a government sanctioned project, in a top secret underground lab near Washington D.C., Caine hides his success from a Senate committee overseeing the project.  Determined to test the serum on a human subject, Caine injects himself with the serum, and after nearly dying in the process, does become invisible.  Unfortunately the serum that is supposed to make Sebastian visible again fails, and again nearly kills him.The frustration of not being able to return to normal, seems to make Caine mentally unstable, and eventually violent.  He is also upset that his ex-lover Linda, is now romantically involved with Matt.  To try and get Caine back under control, the couple reports what has been happening to their superior in the government, but Caine murders him before he can take action.  Caine returns to the laboratory, and after locking it down, begins to attack and kill the members of his team.  The movie finishes as an extended and spectacular battle to the death.The outstanding special effects featured in the film are worthy of the Oscar nomination they received.  Very impressive and vibrant looking are the reconstruction scenes, where blood vessels appear, followed by the skeletal frame, muscles and ligaments, and then skin and hair.  Although in the early days of CGI, the effects still hold up very well, as the invisible Caine becomes visible when swimming in water, exposed to smoke or steam, and even when set on fire.  The film also features some impressive kill scenes and gore.Hollow Man explores the dark side of man's nature, as free from conventional restraints, Caine freely crosses moral boundaries.  Featuring some provocative nudity and sexual violence, some may find that the occasionally sleazy path taken to be unrealistic, but people often do not behave like saints.  The magnitude of Caine's moral transgressions may be extreme, but the possibility is certainly real.Paul Verhoeven does an excellent job throughout the film, but particularly shines in the action sequences, which are often excessive, visually stunning, and arranged to peak and valley, crashing like waves hitting the shore.  With a central premise of invisibility, realism is off the table fairly early, but the story grabs and holds your attention anyway, as it progresses from a scientific exploration to complete mayhem.  The love triangle is completely unoriginal and a bit weak, but still serves as a motivating factor in what happens.  Kevin Bacon gives a brave performance, as even when he is ""invisible"", he is often present in the scene wearing some kind of colored bodysuit.  Except for Sebastian Caine, the characters aren't particularly deep, but are still pretty engaging.  The cast also includes Joey Slotnick, Kim Dickens, Greg Grunberg, Rhona Mitra, and William Devane, who all do a solid job.The DVD includes a number of featurettes, and an informative commentary track featuring Verhoeven, Bacon, and writer Andrew Marlowe, which covers technical aspects, the cast, and fun facts about the production.  Bacon describes how being invisible, isolated him from rest of the cast in some regard.  The film's lively musical score is by the masterful Jerry Goldsmith.

I wish they had just made it an optional audio-only commentary, so we can see the entire thing.  The best part of the DVD is the isolated score track because the Varese Sarabande soundtrack album does not have all the cues.  Yes, I think this should silence all the individuals (such as me) that complain about lack of extras.  This baby has everything.  Deleted scenes, commentary by a cast member and a couple of the crew, isolated score w/composer commentary, one behind-the-scenes featurette which is then broken up into 15 to talk about all the individual aspects of making the movie.

Kevin Bacon, always a must see is like in The River Wild an excelent villain, while Elisabeth Shue and Josh Brolin are likeable, somewhat clumsy heroes. The movies special effects are breathtaking, yet not to overdone. Paul Verhoevens own style was never better balanced, just the right mixture of Starship Troopers and Basic Instinct. Nothing seems constructed or flat. Last but not least, there is this fantastic Score by Jerry Goldsmith, a haunting combination of Oscar nominated Basic Instinct an prize-winning The Omen. Hollow Man is certainly not the movie to re-write motion-picture-history but a well done, entertaining flick to kill a cold January evening.The DVD is, as to expect from Columbia a fine produced collecters peace. The bonus material features just the right parts of the movie, like Verhoeven always funny commentary and Goldsmith's thrilling score. Sounds and images are crystal cleare and invisible Sebastian's voice, moving unseen from front to rear and back is truly chilling.For fans of Kevin Bacon, Elisabeth Shue, Paul Verhoeven or Jerry Goldsmith the movie delivers everything to have a lot of fun and as for the critics, I'de like to see a guy like Roger Ebert direct a movie.
