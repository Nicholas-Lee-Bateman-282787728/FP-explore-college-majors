I identified with the young teacher as he struggled to find his place in the public school.  The first headmaster was a warm and delightful old gentleman. The next headmaster was the man who always fixed that which was not broken.  The love life of the young teacher, his children, his loss, his caring -- all made me feel what we have abandoned in modern education.  I loved this story so much I bought for my brother as a gift.If I could turn back the clock I would re-invent the English classroom where language and poetry are honored and students can recite those passages that will guide them through life.

795800,A1N134HXXST079,B00018WENM,"Baking Enthusiast ""Liza""","[2, 2]","First off, I'm one of those who enjoys any drama, American or foreign, that depicts teachers, academia, and even anything remotely to do with a school - ""The Paper Chase,"" ""Good Will Hunting,"" ""Diabolique,"" ""Goodbye, Mr. Chips,"" ""The Chorus,"" etc.  The 1980 production of ""To Serve Them All My Days"" remains one of my favorites.  I viewed this miniseries many years ago and recently with nothing new at hand, viewed it for the second time.  Despite already knowing the story, I've to say it hasn't lost its appeal for me at all.  It wasn't one of the more well-known British productions even back in the `80s and I think part of its appeal to me is that it looks like a homegrown production.  By that, I mean that it doesn't have the gloss or polish that later British productions, especially those by BBC, had.  It even looks like it was made on the cheap, but the story is powerful and quite moving.The series is comprised of 13 episodes that span the years of 1918 to 1938 or thereabouts.  The story centers on a soldier, David Powlett-Jones (PJ), who's just returned from active duty during WWI.  He ends up teaching at a Devon boarding school called Bamfylde.  Coming from a coal-mining family in South Wales and ever conscious of the class differences, he tries to settle into his new life and devotes himself to the education and guidance of his boys.  As the decades go by, he finds purpose and meaning in the life he's chosen.  In between, he marries and suffers some tragedies that make him a better man in the long run.  It's a very lengthy story that I find difficult to synopsize (I've found sites that unfortunately provide too much of the plot).  Suffice to say that the miniseries is similar to ""Goodbye, Mr. Chips,"" but has a more pronounced political and social bent to it.  PJ is vocal about the backward thinking of his era and wants to move the school toward a more progressive future even it means displeasing those who'd rather cling to the status quo.As is the norm with most British productions, the acting here is first-rate, especially John Duttine as PJ and Frank Middlemass as the very amiable headmaster, Algy Herries.  Lots of very interesting characters and each one well-defined, as well as a great many truly intelligent dialogues.  The political and social issues (socialism, miners' rights, bigotry) add meaning and depth to the story and not just there as window dressing.  This is definitely a worthwhile series whose themes of fairness, endurance, dedication, service to others, love and true knowledge will never lose their relevance.  It took many hours (approximately 12) to view it all, but they are some of the best hours I've spent.",5,"""Look ahead to a life worth living""",1216512000,"07 20, 2008",2008,2677,"['First', ""'m"", 'one', 'who', 'enjoys', 'drama', 'American', 'foreign', 'teachers', 'academia', 'even', 'anything', 'remotely', 'do', 'school', 'Paper', 'Chase', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'Diabolique', 'Goodbye', 'Mr.', 'Chips', 'Chorus', 'etc', '1980', 'production', 'Serve', 'Them', 'All', 'My', 'Days', 'one', 'favorites', 'viewed', 'miniseries', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'recently', 'nothing', 'new', 'hand', 'viewed', 'second', 'time', 'already', 'knowing', 'story', ""'ve"", 'say', ""n't"", 'lost', 'appeal', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'more', 'well-known', 'British', 'productions', 'even', 'back', '80s', 'think', 'part', 'appeal', 'homegrown', 'production', 'mean', ""n't"", 'have', 'gloss', 'polish', 'later', 'British', 'productions', 'especially', 'BBC', 'had', 'even', 'was', 'made', 'cheap', 'story', 'powerful', 'quite', 'moving.The', 'series', 'comprised', '13', 'episodes', 'span', 'years', '1918', '1938', 'thereabouts', 'story', 'centers', 'soldier', 'David', 'Powlett-Jones', 'PJ', 'who', 'just', 'returned', 'active', 'duty', 'WWI', 'up', 'teaching', 'Devon', 'boarding', 'school', 'called', 'Bamfylde', 'Coming', 'coal-mining', 'family', 'South', 'Wales', 'ever', 'conscious', 'class', 'differences', 'settle', 'new', 'life', 'education', 'guidance', 'boys', 'decades', 'go', 'purpose', 'meaning', 'life', 'chosen', 'tragedies', 'make', 'better', 'man', 'long', 'run', 'very', 'lengthy', 'story', 'find', 'difficult', 'synopsize', ""'ve"", 'found', 'sites', 'unfortunately', 'provide', 'too', 'much', 'plot', 'Suffice', 'say', 'miniseries', 'similar', 'Goodbye', 'Mr.', 'Chips', 'more', 'pronounced', 'political', 'social', 'bent', 'PJ', 'vocal', 'backward', 'thinking', 'era', 'move', 'school', 'more', 'progressive', 'future', 'even', 'displeasing', 'who', ""'d"", 'rather', 'cling', 'status', 'quo.As', 'norm', 'most', 'British', 'productions', 'acting', 'here', 'first-rate', 'especially', 'John', 'Duttine', 'PJ', 'Frank', 'Middlemass', 'very', 'amiable', 'headmaster', 'Algy', 'Herries', 'Lots', 'very', 'interesting', 'characters', 'one', 'well-defined', 'as', 'well', 'great', 'many', 'truly', 'intelligent', 'dialogues', 'political', 'social', 'issues', 'socialism', 'miners', 'rights', 'bigotry', 'add', 'meaning', 'depth', 'story', 'not', 'just', 'there', 'window', 'dressing', 'definitely', 'worthwhile', 'series', 'themes', 'fairness', 'endurance', 'dedication', 'service', 'others', 'love', 'true', 'knowledge', 'will', 'never', 'lose', 'relevance', 'took', 'many', 'hours', 'approximately', '12', 'view', 'are', 'best', 'hours', ""'ve"", 'spent']",N/A

Looking at it again, I think the wait was worth it. Duttine makes an thoroughly engaging hero, from the first time we see him with the shakes to the last as the dynamic and compassionate head master he has become. Frank Middlemass and Alan MacNaughton are superb, the first as the head master who hires and guides Powlett-Jones, and the second as the ascerbic but rather lonely teacher who befriends him. I do think now that the last woman in Powlett-Jones' life is so utterly upper-crust as to be a bit off-putting. And as wonderful a school as Bamfylde is, it's worth remembering that it has been all the public schools like Bamfylde that have helped make Britain one the most rigidly class conscious countries it continues to be. But even recognizing that the Delderfield book and this production very much extoll the establishment's view of itself, it still is a very satisfying piece of work. Just keep a grain of salt handy.

795804,AUEHG0DB54B7K,B00018WENM,David A. Wend,"[1, 1]","I saw ""To Serve Them All My Days"" when it was first broadcast on Masterpiece Theater and I have never forgotten the series, so I was very pleased to see that it was released on DVD.  The story has been nicely related by other reviewers so I will concentrate on the wonderful performances.  John Duttine is marvelous as David Powlett-Jones; his range and depth of emotion are perfectly portrayed in a role that must have been very demanding.  Frank Middlemass makes Algy Herries a beloved Headmaster; gregarious, open and unflappable but very serious when he has to be.  We are quite sorry when he ""retires"" as Headmaster but are glad that he does not entirely leave the story.  Neil Stacy is excellent as Carter, a character that I could loath and find some sympathy and understanding for.The women in David Powlett-Jones' life are certainly fascinating and charming.  Belinda Lang was truly wonderful as his first wife, Beth.  She played the role with particular sweetness tempered by good humor and good sense; Kim Barden made quite a seductive Julia Derbyshire and Susan Jameson made a troubled would-be politician and lover for Powlett-Jones.I recall that Alistair Cooke had warm praise for Charles Kay who turned in a perfect performance as Alcock, the icy Headmaster who succeeds Algy Herries.  Alan MacNaughton was a delight as Howarth, who may have had a bleak outlook on life but was a solid friend to David Powlett-Jones.Having come from a military boarding school founded along the lines of English boarding schools by an Episcopal minister, it was easy for me to recall events from my own education and compare the teachers of Bamfylde with ones that I was taught by.  The series is so good because it is true to life and I would believe that R. F. Delderfield based his books on real people and events from his own experience.  This is an unforgettable series that is well-acted and holds your interest throughout its 13 parts.

795807,A2VE83MZF98ITY,B00018WENM,"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick""","[17, 17]","I spent the long weekend getting reacquainted with an old friend, so to speak.  I got the boxed set of the wonderful miniseries, 'To Serve Them All My Days', based on the novel of the same name by R.F. Delderfield.  I saw this first when I was barely a lad of sixteen or so, just at my school-leaving age and going off to university.  I was amazed then at how much from 'before the war' remained true to form for school, and watching it again now twenty years later, it stands up to the test of time perfectly well (and I was once again amazed at the true-to-life nature of the whole enterprise).  The series won the BAFTA award for the best television series of its year, and rightfully so.The miniseries is done in thirteen parts, each just under an hour long, as a co-production of the BBC and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.  It was filmed in a real public school, Milton Abbey School in Dorset (not too far from part of the country where the mythical Bamfylde School resides), and many of the 'extras' in school shots are actually school boys of the Milton Abbey School.  The settings didn't have to be changed too much to accommodate the inter-war period d&eacute;cor, and of course the architecture for the most part was hundreds of years older.However well done the sets and images are, this is still a teleplay about relationships and the coming of age, not just of the boys in the school, nor even of the lead character, Mr. Powlett-Jones, but really of the whole of society.  The inter-war period in Britain was a fascinating time of societal development, particularly in terms of politics.  Delderfield introduces this as an ever-present but never centre stage idea through the dealings of Powlett-Jones, son of a Welsh coal mining family, some of his out-of-school relationships, and the clash that this inevitably sets up with the privileged corps of boys at the school.In the first episode, David Powlett-Jones has just returned from the trenches in the first world war, wounded both physically and spiritually.  He is suspicious of the job offer at this upper-class bastion, but the gentle understanding of the headmaster, Algy Herries, encourages him to stay.  His relationships with the other teachers are a fascinating study, particularly the gung-ho-warrior type Carter (whose not-always-disabled knee seems to have kept him out of the war) and the cynic-with-a-good-soul Howarth, who becomes Powlett-Jones' best friend over the course of their life together at Bamfylde.Howarth chides Powlett-Jones at one point about the kind of monastic life that one can fall into at a remote school such as Bamfylde.Howarth: Some men can live the celibate life. I don't fancy you're one of them.David Powlett-Jones: What did *you* do about women all these years?Howarth [pausing, smiling]: Your appetite for sordid revelations never ceases to astonish me.Howarth reveals some of his indiscretions (remember, this is post-Victorian England, and the revelations, such as they are, would be considered exceedingly mild by television standards today).  Powlett-Jones over the course of his twenty years at Bamfylde ends up with three primary loves; Beth, a young wife who dies early; Julia, someone not to be tied down to a school (or even the island of Britain), but keeps regular if long-separated contact with David over time; and Christine, the failed Labour candidate who becomes his second wife, taking on a role at the school as well, not the least of which is to remind the now-headmaster Powlett-Jones that there is a world outside the still-privileged halls of Bamfylde.The teleplay is exceedingly well done, with the acting and the writing supporting each other in such a way to give real insight into the psychological make-up of the characters.  John Duttine played David Powlett-Jones with a good amount of passion; however, I am torn between Frank Middlemass (as Herries) and Alan MacNaughtan (as Howarth) as to who my favourite actor is in the series.  Both bring so much to their roles, and I can see myself in each of them in many ways more so than I can identify with Powlett-Jones.  For the women, David's first wife Beth is played by Belinda Lang; Julia is played by Kim Braden (trekkies may recognise her from bit parts both in Star Trek film and series work); Susan Jameson plays Christine, David's second wife (fans of 'Coronation Street' may recognise her from that show).  Each of the three is very well suited for their respective roles - Lang plays the young, optimist; Braden plays the worldly, ambitious but sensitive soul; Jameson plays the idealist who comes down to earth, managing to keep her ideals intact.The play does a good job also of keep the boys from becoming a faceless, anonymous mass (a decided danger, given their uniformity in dress as well as age).  There are particular boys who stand out, but one gets the sense from the watching that they are all individuals, and treated as such, both by the careful and caring headmasterly type Harries and Powlett-Jones, as well as the cynical Howarth (and even by the more scathing of the teachers, whose style is no longer in vogue).The situations are credible, interesting, and instructive.  The characters are fully formed and worthwhile.  The production values are not to cinematic standards, but hold up very well over time (the lack of lavishness befits the nature of the school and the nature of the time as well).This remains one of my favourite series of all time.  The DVD has few extras, but among them are photographs, background information both on the school and on Delderfield, and the lyrics to the school song (which opens each episode, sung by the congregation of boys), by Kenyon Emrys-Roberts: 'Look ahead to a life worth living, Full of hope, full of faith, full of cheer,...'",5,One of my favourites of all time,1133136000,"11 28,

There are three episodes per disc, on four discs--and it was all I could do to wait until the next evening to watch the next--except the last disc, which, to my disappointment, had only two episodes (I did not want the story to end!). Since others have given details of the story, I shall remark only on the production.This film, made in 1980, is one of the old-fashioned BBC dramas, which emphasised quality in production, costume, and setting. It goes without saying that the characters are superbly acted [I especially liked Algie, the first Headmaster, an Anglican priest]. The story is heartwarming; in fact, one may want to keep a box of tissues handy for the weepy bits. Set in a British Public School [i.e., private, but publicly funded so that any boy who qualifies can attend], the production, which was filmed at Milton Abbey in Dorset, focuses on the lives of the Masters and their charges from 1916 to approximately 1931.Although the cinematography is excellent, the color has, unfortunately, deteriorated, especially the skies, which have become pale, and if characters are standing with the sky at their backs, haloes hover slightly over their heads. This, however, is only an occasional problem, and the story is so interesting that I did not let it bother me.I did notice significant changes in the story, which I first heard as a BBC radio series, based on the novel, but the series is strong enough to stand on its own.If you like action-packed adventure, ""To Serve Them All My Days"" is not for you, but if you like quality drama, about an England that has largely vanished, this film will indubitably be your cup of quality tea!",4,Absorbing Old-Fashioned Series of Outstanding Quality,1323388800,"12 9, 2011",2011,1756,"['enjoyed', 'Serve', 'My', 'Days', 'immensely', 'hour-long', 'episode', 'riveting', 'dramatic', 'suspense', 'are', 'three', 'episodes', 'disc', 'four', 'discs', 'was', 'could', 'do', 'wait', 'next', 'evening', 'watch', 'next', 'last', 'disc', 'disappointment', 'had', 'only', 'two', 'episodes', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'story', 'end', 'others', 'have', 'given', 'details', 'story', 'shall', 'remark', 'only', 'production.This', 'film', 'made', '1980', 'one', 'old-fashioned', 'BBC', 'dramas', 'emphasised', 'quality', 'production', 'costume', 'setting', 'saying', 'characters', 'are', 'superbly', 'acted', '[', 'especially', 'liked', 'Algie', 'first', 'Headmaster', 'Anglican', 'priest', ']', 'story', 'heartwarming', 'fact', 'one', 'may', 'want', 'keep', 'box', 'tissues', 'handy', 'weepy', 'bits', 'Set', 'British', 'Public', 'School', '[', 'i.e.', 'private', 'publicly', 'funded', 'so', 'boy', 'who', 'can', 'attend', ']', 'production', 'was', 'filmed', 'Milton', 'Abbey', 'Dorset', 'lives', 'Masters', 'charges', '1916', 'approximately', '1931.Although', 'cinematography', 'excellent', 'color', 'unfortunately', 'deteriorated', 'especially', 'skies', 'have', 'become', 'pale', 'characters', 'are', 'standing', 'sky', 'backs', 'haloes', 'hover', 'slightly', 'heads', 'however', 'only', 'occasional', 'problem', 'story', 'so', 'interesting', 'did', 'not', 'let', 'bother', 'me.I', 'did', 'notice', 'significant', 'changes', 'story', 'first', 'heard', 'BBC', 'radio', 'series', 'based', 'novel', 'series', 'strong', 'enough', 'stand', 'own.If', 'action-packed', 'adventure', 'Serve', 'Them', 'All', 'My', 'Days', 'not', 'like', 'quality', 'drama', 'England', 'largely', 'vanished', 'film', 'will', 'indubitably', 'be', 'cup', 'quality', 'tea']",N/A

Greenbaum,"[46, 46]","Those who saw this 13-episode miniseries in 1984 or read the Delderfield book won't be disappointed in the adaptation, finally released on DVD.David Powlett-Jones, invalided from World War I by shell-shock and a leg injury, is encouraged to take up a career as a schoolmaster.  He is hired by the headmaster of a boys boarding school in Southwestern England, and under the gentle encouragement of that headmaster, Algy Herries, finds he has quite a knack for teaching.  His leftist (for their time) political views shake up the school, but he is quickly accepted.The series covers the period between near the end of World War I to the start of World War II, and in that rapidly changing world, we see David evolve and gain confidence in himself and what he believes in.  Perhaps this is best brought out in the relationships he has with three women, his first wife, Beth, who is tragically killed, Julia Derbyshire, with whom he has a romance, and his second wife, Christine, a would-be Labour politician.  All recognize his genius and encourage him, and it is with their help that he finds fulfillment.This was definitely a low budget affair (you see the same boys over and over again, even though over twenty years transpires!), with few outside scenes, and when the school catches on fire, the effects are minimal.  But it doesn't matter.  The acting is spectacular.  John Duttine is spectacular as David.  Frank Middlemass, who is probably the most familiar name to American audiences due to his part in ""As Time Goes By"", also excels as Herries.  Look for an excellent small part as the disciplinarian Cordwainer by longtime British character actor, John Welsh.  Again, though, the British showed their knack of putting together a large cast using actors, few of whom have been heard of beyond their shores.There are few extras on the DVDs.  A text biography of Delderfield, the lyrics to the Bamfylde school song (custom written, though it sounds like a hymn), an explanation that the school scenes were filmed using a school in Dorset, as well as the students there.  That's the sole disappointment.  Though the series was filmed cheaply, more extras on the DVD wouldn't have cost much.Excellent.  Highly recommended.",5,Excellent adaptation of the R.F.

795810,A1RJJ56MBJMX87,B00018WENM,Gavin Wilson,"[5, 5]","'To Serve Them All My Days' was published as a book in 1972, and made for telly in 1980. It is, to my knowledge, one of the first series that Andrew Davies wrote the screenplay for -- before going on to 'Very Peculiar Practice' and excellent adaptations of 'Vanity Fair' and 'Pride and Prejudice'. Apart from the last episode in this series, which is a bit of an anti-climax, he does a superb job throughout. The actors all put in career-best performances, which does have a down-side for John Duttine, in that he is still best-known for one of the very first things he did.The potential problem for this series is that it immediately invites comparisons with two other productions. The first is 'Goodbye Mr Chips', which took Robert Donat through his earliest days as a teacher, his loss of his wife and baby, and eventual death in retirement at the school. The second is Michael Palin's first Ripping Yarn, 'Tomkinson's Schooldays', which was filmed at the same location (Milton Abbey School), only a few years earlier. It doesn't help that headmaster Herries is played by Frank Middlemass, who also played a wonderfully sadistic retired general in another Ripping Yarn.But the plot is so good here, and the characterisation so well done and endearing, that the three works seem to enrich each other. Maybe it is because all are sympathetic to the English public school, despite Delderfield putting a socialist headmaster in charge of the senior school and his socialist wife in charge of the prep school. (I haven't read the book, but I assume that these details weren't added just to add piquancy, given that the first transmission was during the early Thatcher years.)If you choose to buy this series in parts, then part three is the most dispensable. The plot loses a bit of momentum once the South African headmaster has died, and frankly the woman that Powlett-Jones chooses to pursue in part three isn't as desirable as the two previous women in his life. The plot becomes so predictable in part three that you half-hope Carter comes back on the scene to antagonise old PJ.The nice little irony at the end is that it isn't necessarily PJ who serves the school all his days -- that honour goes to Howarth.As other reviewers have mentioned, the extras are nothing to write home about: no commentary, no sub-titles or alternative languages, and glorious mono sound. The picture is occasionally jittery -- I assume because a few frames of film were damaged. The BBC would have done a better DVD production job, had they not sold the rights to AcornVideo, but we mustn't grumble.I suspect this is a series you will want to view very swiftly -- perhaps even more than one episode a day if, like me, you have trouble restraining yourself. Depending on the size of your DVD collection, you probably won't watch it again more frequently than once every five years. But you'll really want to lend it to friends and family, just to hear their pleasure at seeing this marvellous series again.",5,The extended Mr Chips?,1112832000,"04 7, 2005",2005,2989,"['Serve', 'Them', 'All', 'My', 'Days', 'was', 'published', 'book', '1972', 'made', 'telly', '1980', 'knowledge', 'one', 'first', 'series', 'Andrew', 'Davies', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'going', ""'Very"", 'Peculiar', 'Practice', 'excellent', 'adaptations', ""'Vanity"", 'Fair', ""'Pride"", 'Prejudice', 'Apart', 'last', 'episode', 'series', 'bit', 'anti-climax', 'superb', 'job', 'actors', 'put', 'career-best', 'performances', 'have', 'down-side', 'John', 'Duttine', 'still', 'best-known', 'one', 'very', 'first', 'things', 'potential', 'problem', 'series', 'immediately', 'comparisons', 'two', 'other', 'productions', 'first', ""'Goodbye"", 'Mr', 'Chips', 'took', 'Robert', 'Donat', 'earliest', 'days', 'teacher', 'loss', 'wife', 'baby', 'eventual', 'death', 'retirement', 'school', 'second', 'Michael', 'Palin', 'first', 'Ripping', 'Yarn', ""'Tomkinson"", 'Schooldays', 'was', 'filmed', 'same', 'location', 'Milton', 'Abbey', 'School', 'only', 'few', 'years', 'earlier', ""n't"", 'help', 'headmaster', 'Herries', 'played', 'Frank', 'Middlemass', 'who', 'also', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'sadistic', 'retired', 'general', 'Ripping', 'Yarn.But', 'plot', 'so', 'good', 'here', 'characterisation', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'endearing', 'three', 'works', 'seem', 'enrich', 'other', 'Maybe', 'are', 'sympathetic', 'English', 'public', 'school', 'Delderfield', 'putting', 'socialist', 'headmaster', 'charge', 'senior', 'school', 'socialist', 'wife', 'charge', 'prep', 'school', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'assume', 'details', 'were', ""n't"", 'added', 'just', 'add', 'piquancy', 'given', 'first', 'transmission', 'was', 'early', 'Thatcher', 'years', 'choose', 'buy', 'series', 'parts', 'then', 'part', 'three', 'most', 'dispensable', 'plot', 'bit', 'momentum', 'South', 'African', 'headmaster', 'died', 'frankly', 'woman', 'Powlett-Jones', 'chooses', 'pursue', 'part', 'three', ""n't"", 'as', 'desirable', 'two', 'previous', 'women', 'life', 'plot', 'so', 'predictable', 'part', 'three', 'half-hope', 'Carter', 'back', 'scene', 'antagonise', 'old', 'PJ.The', 'nice', 'little', 'irony', 'end', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'PJ', 'who', 'school', 'days', 'honour', 'Howarth.As', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'mentioned', 'extras', 'are', 'nothing', 'write', 'home', 'commentary', 'sub-titles', 'alternative', 'languages', 'glorious', 'mono', 'sound', 'picture', 'occasionally', 'jittery', 'assume', 'few', 'frames', 'film', 'were', 'damaged', 'BBC', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'DVD', 'production', 'job', 'had', 'not', 'sold', 'rights', 'AcornVideo', 'must', ""n't"", 'grumble.I', 'suspect', 'series', 'will', 'want', 'view', 'very', 'swiftly', 'perhaps', 'even', 'more', 'one', 'episode', 'day', 'have', 'trouble', 'restraining', 'Depending', 'size', 'DVD', 'collection', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'watch', 'again', 'more', 'frequently', 'once', 'five', 'years', ""'ll"", 'really', 'want', 'lend', 'friends', 'family', 'just', 'hear', 'pleasure', 'seeing', 'marvellous', 'series', 'again']",N/A

David is from a Welsh coal mining family, and he has strong socialist convictions as well as a large chip on his shoulder about the priviledged youths and men he now finds himself among.  This is a subtext that runs throughout the series, but the primary story deals with David's growing self confidence and abilities. There is also a romantic subtext, with David being involved with three women, a wife who dies tragically, a brief fling with another woman, and finally a second wife who is both upper class and a Labour politician, thus combining the two disparate elements in David's life.John Duttine is wonderful as the star of the series, but there is an excellent supporting cast led hy Frank Middlemass and Alan MacNaughton.

I can't say enough good things about this BBC production.The story begins in England with David Powlett-Jones seeking employment as a teacher at an elite boarding school called Bamfylde.  A returning soldier, Powlett-Jones is a limping and a shell-shocked victim of the trench warfare of World War I. He's also depressed and feels he won't get the job since he's the son of a Welsh miner and has no previous background as a teacher. The headmaster, a terrific character, takes an immediate liking to the young man and Powlett-Jones is hired to teach history.The story spans a twenty-year period where Powlett-Jones becomes an accomplished teacher, is admired by his students and gains the respect of his fellow teachers.  Early on, he finds a wonderful woman to love, but fate intervenes and his  life doesn't turn out the way he thought it would. This is not a Hollywood story! The characters are believable and all of the actors do a terrific job.

His name is David Powlett-Jones (John Duttine) and he hails from the coal mines of Wales.  Though he feels woefully out of place, the jovial headmaster (Frank Middlemass) likes him and he's hired.  We watch as David adjusts to life as a school master, learns to deal with the privileged boys and the opinionated staff, experiences love and loss, and grows up to be just the man the headmaster knew he would.This 13-part miniseries on four disks is simply wonderful.  The story spans twenty years, going slowly so we get to know and care about David and his associates.  John Duttine is very convincing as the timid and self-conscious young man who gradually learns about life and people.  Middlemass is excellent as the wise and cheerful headmaster and Alan MacNaughton gives a particularly touching performance as a crusty old house master.  The series was filmed on location in a beautiful English boys' school and the sense of history and tradition is palpable.The story finds comedy and tragedy in everyday situations.  It was a pleasure to watch a group of people who lived together in the days when they really talked and listened to each other, with nary an electronic device to distract them.

Veteran writer/producer Andrew Davies hit a home run out of the park with a magnificent adaptation of Delderfield's novel of England between wars. John Duttine dominates the series with his portrayal of David Powlett-Jones, in a subtle and winning performance, Frank Middlemass is supercharged as Headmaster Algie Herries, and Alan MacNaughtan rightly steals every scene he's in with a wry, eccentric brilliance. The performances from top to bottom are consistent and wonderfully rich. Delderfield's novel examines the futility of war with exacting subtlety, wisely and articulately focusing on the lives of youths destined for its relentless killing fields, and the adults whose experiences have harvested for them wisdom and courage. Thank God for that, there are few enough intelligent containers of truth in an age of perpetual war. This series could be recommended viewing for young American men and women facing daily the campus scourge of army recruiters and the jingoism of war-for-glory profiteers - I can't think of a better wakeup call. Story, setting, actors, and a first rate literary adaptation combine for an unforgettable experience. One of the best things about this film is the Bamfylde school song sung at the  beginning of each episode.

I saw the miniseries on PBS Masterpiece Theatre back in the early eighties and didn't have the foresight then to tape them.

Since then we have watched it at least 3 times, every 4 months or so, and find it as enjoyable each time around.  It's like visiting an old friend and it seems that you get something else new out it with each viewing.  We find ourselves immersed in the time, the culture, the values of the period, and the passion of the characters.  There are 13 episodes in all and although not as complete as the book or totally faithful, it captures the essence of the story wonderfully and adds another dimension.  The casting couldn't have been better (just as I would have envisioned them), and the acting is terrific.  The book and video complement each other superbly.

The film-characters fit the book-characters down to the ground--especially the headmaster (who, two decades later, portrays Lionell Hardcastle's father in As Time Goes By, looking hardly a year older).The author, as I recall, reflects the popular politcal sympathy of his era (the very early 1970's), which may help account for the book's well-deserved success upon its publication. However, his hero's timeless advice to question popular academic culture (in the novel conservative) thus becomes unintentionally ironic--given today's much more liberal-leaning academic philosophy.To Serve Them All My Days is Goodbye Mr. Chips (the plot of which it generally parallels) for the more community-and-politically involved--and is all the better for being so, regardless of one's political persuasion.
