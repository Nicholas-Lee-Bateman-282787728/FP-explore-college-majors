However, the building is set soon for demolition.When Da Ming arrives, he is not familiar with the bathhouse, but he is enlightened by the relationship his father has with his mentally challenged brother.  Seeing this special relationship is unique and endearing to watch the bond, fun and love they share, and in the name of work also.

Please note that elements of the plot are discussed. Da Ming (Pu Cunxin) is a businessman in a big city in southern China who receives a cryptic postcard from his younger brother, Er Ming (Jiang Wu). Er Ming is retarded and the postcard shows a rough drawing of their father, Master Liu (Zhu Xu), lying on a slab with Er Ming sitting next to him. Thinking his father is dead or seriously ill, Da Ming arrives in Beijing and shows up at the traditional bath house his father owns. Liu may be aging and is not too well, but he still manages the bath house with the help of Er Ming. The two enjoy each other's company. They run races and have contests to see who can hold his breath longest. Er Ming may be retarded and slow, but he takes delight in the work of the bath house and his responsibilities. He has a good heart. But all this can't last; the neighborhood is scheduled to be torn down for new development.As Da Ming's visit lengthens, he becomes reacquainted with his father and brother and the life they lead running the bath house. He comes to appreciate the slower pace of things. Through his father and Er Ming, he's able to observe the lives of the customers. When his father dies, he makes some decisions that he soon realizes are wrong. He's learned more than he thought during his stay with his father and brother at the bath house.The movie is a bit sentimental. It pushes the themes of family and the value of the old ways. It also is a warm and amusing look at peoples' lives. We come to know the two old men who argue over their cricket matches and accuse each other of trickery, and the hen-pecked man with a harridan for a wife, who has a marital problem that won't rise to the occasion, and the chubby, shy teen-ager who sings O Solo Mio with confidence in the showers but can't get anything out on a stage, and the young man who dreams of business success and keeps getting in debt to the wrong men. And since most of the movie takes place in this old, traditional bath house, we can see a slice of Chinese life which is rapidly fading away. Master Liu's bath house is not just a place to bathe, it's a place to spend the day if you want, to sleep, to gossip, to enjoy friends, to play long games of xiangqi, to soak and get a massage, to be cupped or get a manicure (with an instrument that looks like it could peel the flesh off your finger if Master Liu ever slipped). It's a place where problems can be fixed, whether marital or singing or crickets.At the end of the movie the bulldozers are tearing down the neighborhood. The bath house finally has closed. The old patrons are scattering to new homes. Er Ming and his brother will soon be returning to Da Ming's home, and we hope Da Ming's wife will learn the lesson's about family that her husband has learned. We're hopeful, but we're not sure.The actors all do fine jobs. Zhu Xu, who plays the father, played the lead in a very good movie, The King of Masks. The DVD looks just fine.

560547,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B00004Z1FD,Dennis Littrell,"[3, 3]","This delighted audiences at a number of film festivals, and it is not hard to see why.  Director Yang Zhang, with the help of some very nice work by the three principle actors, Xu Zhu as the father, Master Liu; Quanxin Pu as the elder son, Da Ming; and especially Wu Jiang as the irrepressible and lovable younger son, Er Ming, spins a tale that will warm the coldest heart.The film starts with a man taking a shower in an automated booth in the middle of Beijing.  He puts some money in a slot, opens the door, takes off his clothes and puts some of them on a conveyer belt to be cleaned, steps into the shower and gets cleaned with brushes and squirts of water and soap as though he's a car at the car wash.  This is the future symbolically speaking, and the old bathhouse we will see in the next scene is the past.  Agrarian China is giving way to industrial China.Pollution?  Cultural revolution hang-over?  Industrialization blues?  No way.  What we have here is a celebration of people and their kindness and love for one another, a celebration of goodness in the hearts of men.  Yet I wonder how the Chinese government views this film.  On the one hand, it clearly presents a pleasant view of China and its people.  It is stringently nonpolitical without criticism of the present regime expressed or implied.  Yet there is the slightest sense that the good old ways are going to be replaced by something that may not be as good.  I think Yang Zhang had the wisdom to just let that be as it may.  Tell a story about old men at the bathhouse where they get back rubs and massages, where they tell tall tales and reminisce about the good old days, where they can relax and play Chinese chess and stage cricket fights, where the Master is a spry and wise old guy and his assistant is his son, who may be retarded or autistic, but who does his job with glee and an infectious spirit of fun and good will.Enter back on the scene the older son, Da Ming, who is polished, well groomed and taciturn.  He is uncomfortable with what he sees as the unsophisticated behavior of his father and brother.  He represents modern China with his tie and his briefcase, his cell phone and his education.  He has only returned because he thought his father was dying.  When he sees that this is not true, he packs his bags and is set to return to his wife and his career.  But then a crisis ensues and it is during this crisis that Da Ming sees the value of the natural, people-centered life that his father and his brother have been living.And so Yang Zhang reconciles the old and the new, and does so in such a charming manner that I will not object, especially since his style is so neat and so carefully expressed.  One of the nice things he does that I miss in most movies is the way he dovetails the subplots within the larger story so that they are resolved before the picture ends.  The bathhouse regular who sings ""O sole mio"" in the bathhouse as the water showers down upon him, much to the delight of Er Ming, finds that he can't sing in public because of stage fright.  Near the end of the film he loses his stage fright and sings thanks to some inspired help from Er Ming.  And the bathhouse regular who is losing his wife because...well, he tells a tale to Master Liu before he confesses the real reason.  But Liu understands and again before the movie is over, husband and wife are reconciled.This kind of ""happy ending"" movie-making is unusual in today artistic and international films, or in almost any film directed at adults.  Some happy endings are so contrived as to embarrass not only their contrivers but their audiences.  And some are so blatantly condescending that the audience is offended.  Here however the audience is delighted.See this especially for the comedic performance by Wu Jiang whose warm effervescence overcomes any handicap his character may have.",5,A little corny but wonderful all the same,1140912000,"02 26, 2006",2006,3873,"['delighted', 'audiences', 'number', 'film', 'festivals', 'not', 'hard', 'see', 'why', 'Director', 'Yang', 'Zhang', 'help', 'very', 'nice', 'work', 'three', 'principle', 'actors', 'Xu', 'Zhu', 'father', 'Master', 'Liu', 'Quanxin', 'Pu', 'elder', 'son', 'Da', 'Ming', 'especially', 'Wu', 'Jiang', 'irrepressible', 'lovable', 'younger', 'son', 'Er', 'Ming', 'tale', 'will', 'warm', 'coldest', 'heart.The', 'film', 'man', 'taking', 'shower', 'automated', 'booth', 'middle', 'Beijing', 'money', 'slot', 'door', 'clothes', 'conveyer', 'belt', 'be', 'cleaned', 'steps', 'shower', 'cleaned', 'brushes', 'squirts', 'water', 'soap', 'car', 'car', 'wash', 'future', 'symbolically', 'speaking', 'old', 'bathhouse', 'will', 'see', 'next', 'scene', 'past', 'Agrarian', 'China', 'giving', 'way', 'industrial', 'China.Pollution', 'Cultural', 'revolution', 'hang-over', 'Industrialization', 'blues', 'way', 'What', 'have', 'here', 'celebration', 'people', 'kindness', 'love', 'one', 'celebration', 'goodness', 'hearts', 'men', 'wonder', 'how', 'Chinese', 'government', 'views', 'film', 'one', 'hand', 'clearly', 'pleasant', 'view', 'China', 'people', 'stringently', 'nonpolitical', 'criticism', 'present', 'regime', 'expressed', 'implied', 'slightest', 'sense', 'good', 'old', 'ways', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'replaced', 'something', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'think', 'Yang', 'Zhang', 'had', 'wisdom', 'just', 'let', 'that', 'be', 'may', 'Tell', 'story', 'old', 'men', 'bathhouse', 'where', 'get', 'back', 'rubs', 'massages', 'where', 'tell', 'tall', 'tales', 'reminisce', 'good', 'old', 'days', 'where', 'can', 'relax', 'play', 'Chinese', 'chess', 'stage', 'cricket', 'fights', 'where', 'Master', 'spry', 'wise', 'old', 'guy', 'assistant', 'son', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'retarded', 'autistic', 'who', 'job', 'glee', 'infectious', 'spirit', 'fun', 'good', 'will.Enter', 'back', 'scene', 'older', 'son', 'Da', 'Ming', 'who', 'polished', 'well', 'groomed', 'taciturn', 'uncomfortable', 'what', 'unsophisticated', 'behavior', 'father', 'brother', 'modern', 'China', 'tie', 'briefcase', 'cell', 'phone', 'education', 'only', 'returned', 'thought', 'father', 'was', 'dying', 'When', 'not', 'true', 'bags', 'set', 'return', 'wife', 'career', 'then', 'crisis', 'ensues', 'crisis', 'Da', 'Ming', 'value', 'natural', 'people-centered', 'life', 'father', 'brother', 'have', 'been', 'living.And', 'so', 'Yang', 'Zhang', 'old', 'new', 'so', 'such', 'charming', 'manner', 'will', 'not', 'object', 'especially', 'style', 'so', 'neat', 'so', 'carefully', 'expressed', 'One', 'nice', 'things', 'miss', 'most', 'movies', 'way', 'subplots', 'larger', 'story', 'are', 'resolved', 'picture', 'bathhouse', 'regular', 'who', 'O', 'sole', 'mio', 'bathhouse', 'water', 'showers', 'down', 'much', 'delight', 'Er', 'Ming', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sing', 'public', 'stage', 'fright', 'end', 'film', 'stage', 'fright', 'sings', 'thanks', 'inspired', 'help', 'Er', 'Ming', 'bathhouse', 'regular', 'who', 'losing', 'wife', 'well', 'tale', 'Master', 'Liu', 'real', 'reason', 'Liu', 'understands', 'again', 'movie', 'husband', 'wife', 'are', 'reconciled.This', 'kind', 'happy', 'ending', 'movie-making', 'unusual', 'today', 'artistic', 'international', 'films', 'almost', 'film', 'directed', 'adults', 'happy', 'endings', 'are', 'so', 'contrived', 'embarrass', 'not', 'only', 'contrivers', 'audiences', 'are', 'so', 'blatantly', 'condescending', 'audience', 'offended', 'Here', 'however', 'audience', 'delighted.See', 'especially', 'comedic', 'performance', 'Wu', 'Jiang', 'warm', 'effervescence', 'handicap', 'character', 'may', 'have']",N/A

I will not say more about the plot as its been mention in all the wonderful reviews here.  BUT I have to mention that I am becoming more and more fascinated with the old actor Xu Zhu. I first saw him in King Of Mask and I think he is fantastic. He always have a stern, grouchy grandpapa look that will burst into a heartwarming smile in a split second.Watch out for some of the wackiest characters too. The two sons are good, but the retarted one is both funny, and at the same time made me feel really sad for him.Some other really cute characters are a gentle spoken guy with a domineering, bullying wife, two old men always quibbling about their pet crickets like overgrown kids and a fat &quot;o sole Mio&quot; guy that is comical and yet annoying and irritating , and one of their friend who always dream of striking it rich  :) Wonderful.one of my favourite quote from the movie: &quot;Its time to stop dreaming - get a real job! &quot; wowSome of the most mesmerizing scenes in the movie are in the flash-backs told by the aging father about the importance of water and the sacrifice people take in olden days to obtain water for usage, ceremonies and spiritual uses.These scenes are so dream like with gorgeous cinematography. That cant help but reminds you of those excellent landscapes used by Zhang Yimou , Xie Fei and He Ping. (These 3 directors are known for their lush visuals)Watching these scenes of water searching from the deserts of Northwest China to the arid plateau of the Tibetan Highlands are rich &amp; beautiful with the haunting music and the singing of the Chinese folk song, will absolutely reminds you of great movies like Red Sorghum, A Mongolian Tale, The Road Home and Xiu Xiu, Tian Yu.This movie's message is world wide. Basically the difference in generation gap of the young and old, the modern and the traditional, technology and hand made.As to the question of Ms, Jane Chin about the seduction in reverse...I whole heartedly agree with her.

It's run by an old man and his retarded son and is the place where men spend most of their days soaking in the hot tubs, getting their backs scrubbed and generally socializing.  There's another son too.  He lives in the big city and is a successful businessman.  When he takes a shower, as we see in the opening segment, it's in a coin operated high tech compartment where mechanical brushes scrub his body and hot air blows him dry.  He hasn't seen his father in many years, but he receives a drawing from his brother and assumes the father is dying and so he returns home.Once home, he is drawn into the simple and pleasant life of his father and brother.  And he also learns to enjoy his brother's company, accepting the retardation and feeling the love in the small family.  We see him gradually changing as he keeps calling his wife on his cell phone promising to come back in just a few days more.  Then his father dies.  He's left with a bathhouse and a brother to take care of.  To top this all off, the City is about to knock down the bathhouse and build a shopping mall.The ending is inevitable of course.  We see the family love and acceptance.  And we know that the brother will always be loved and taken care of.  It's a good story.One of the things I liked about it best was that the retarded brother is accepted in the community for what he is.  He works in the bathhouse and contributes to the world around him.  He is always smiling and his simple joys in life are a pleasure to see.All the actors are excellent.  I forgot they were acting and felt I was transformed right into this small town in China.  I got a feeling of what life must be like to run a bathhouse.  And there are also some very moving parts about how lucky this town is to have an abundance of water compared to some other places in China where it is so dry that people do not bathe except on their wedding day or when they make a long pilgrimage to bathe in the river.  It made me realize how important the abundance of water is.This is simple film.  Yet, I was very moved by it.  And felt good at the end.  Recommended.",5,"Unique, amazing and heartwarming.

560555,A1L8HRCM60W0W7,B00004Z1FD,Shashank Tripathi,"[10, 11]","What a heartwarming film from China!The plot is delectably &quot;fresh&quot; yet universal -- a successful businessman from Shenzhen (in southern China, close to Hong Kong) visits his elderly father and younger brother after a long separation, upon a mistaken pictorial message that his father has expired. The old man and the (intellectually deprived) younger son run an old fashioned bathhouse in downtown Beijing. Upon finding out that the postcard he received was misleading and that the father is well and good, the elder brother wants to return back to his life. Will he? Can he?The fluid narrative is laced with some subtle humor so as not to depress or bore the audience. The slice of real-life China is delectable, the scenes of the men's camaraderie and reverie in the bathhouse are alone interesting enough to grab a copy of this DVD. The chemistry between the actors is wonderful.The bathhouse, it turns out, has a deeper presence in the movie than being simply the backdrop for the family. As the father told the son the story of his wife's family in the northern deserts of china, the element of water and bathing becomes an almost sacred ritual. Water was so scarce that a simple bath had profound depth and meaning.Although some moments verge on over-done sweetness (even bordering on cloying during the final park recital scene when water makes an intridguing appearance), &quot;Shower&quot; is overall a very effective film with a simple yet touching message.Highly recommended!",4,I'M HEADING FOR AN &quot;ON-SEN&quot;,1067126400,"10 26, 2003",2003,1496,"['What', 'heartwarming', 'film', 'China', 'plot', 'delectably', 'quot', 'fresh', 'quot', 'universal', 'successful', 'businessman', 'Shenzhen', 'southern', 'China', 'close', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'elderly', 'father', 'younger', 'brother', 'long', 'separation', 'mistaken', 'pictorial', 'message', 'father', 'expired', 'old', 'man', 'intellectually', 'deprived', 'younger', 'son', 'run', 'old', 'fashioned', 'bathhouse', 'downtown', 'Beijing', 'finding', 'out', 'postcard', 'received', 'was', 'misleading', 'father', 'well', 'good', 'elder', 'brother', 'return', 'back', 'life', 'Will', 'Can', 'fluid', 'narrative', 'laced', 'subtle', 'humor', 'so', 'not', 'depress', 'bore', 'audience', 'slice', 'real-life', 'China', 'delectable', 'scenes', 'men', 'camaraderie', 'reverie', 'bathhouse', 'are', 'alone', 'interesting', 'enough', 'grab', 'copy', 'DVD', 'chemistry', 'actors', 'wonderful.The', 'bathhouse', 'out', 'deeper', 'presence', 'movie', 'being', 'simply', 'backdrop', 'family', 'father', 'told', 'son', 'story', 'wife', 'family', 'northern', 'deserts', 'china', 'element', 'water', 'bathing', 'becomes', 'almost', 'sacred', 'ritual', 'Water', 'was', 'so', 'scarce', 'simple', 'bath', 'had', 'profound', 'depth', 'moments', 'verge', 'over-done', 'sweetness', 'even', 'bordering', 'cloying', 'final', 'park', 'recital', 'scene', 'when', 'water', 'intridguing', 'appearance', 'quot', 'Shower', 'quot', 'overall', 'very', 'effective', 'film', 'simple', 'yet', 'touching', 'message.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A
560556,ASFTYWTX1WWFE,B00004Z1FD,Shawn McKenna,"[4, 4]","In one of the fastest growing areas of the world, the burgeoning metropolis Beijing (like many places in the world), many past facets of life are being replaced to make way for ""modern"" conveniences. In the movie Shower, from mainland China's Xian Film Studio directed by Yang Zhang (Spicy Love Soup), this dichotomy of the new and the old is symbolized by the shower and the bath. The shower is a fast convenience that takes water for granted while the bath and especially the bathhouse is a tranquil way of life. Master Liu (Zhu Xu also in King of Masks) is owner of such an establishment where you can bathe, get a massage, get treatments like cupping, get a manicure, play Xiangqi (Chinese Chess), or challenge local patrons to cricket fighting. It is analogous to a men's club (or Cheers) where regulars come to relax as well as socialize (and everybody knows your name as well as your problems). Liu lives with his mentally slow son Er Ming (wonderfully played by Jiang Wu) who helps out with the daily chores.Shower starts off with an idea by bathhouse denizen He Zheng of an automated shower (reminds me of the automated restrooms in large cities like San Francisco or the suicide booths in Futurama) where you pay your money and get put through an automatic human wash that sprays soap, water and scrubs you to a healthy clean. It is a clever idea by a slacker whose entrepreneurial ideas tend to fizzle and who still needs to fix the neon sign for the bathhouse. It is entirely appropriate that he is telling this idea while relaxing in the caldarium.The drama begins when Da Ming (Pu Cunxin), son of Liu, comes to visit from Shenzhen after an extended absence. He came after misinterpreting a postcard that Er Ming sent that seemed to show the death of his father. While Liu was happy to see him he then realized the only reason his son came to visit because he thought he was dead. Da Ming decides to stay for a few days though his faster pace existence is evident by the fact he only takes showers now and not baths. Things have changes so much between them at one point that Liu wishes his son had not even shown up (though at this point Da Ming had lost his younger brother while buying a ticket home).The distant relationship between Liu and Da Ming is counterbalanced between the beautifully simple and close relationship between Er Ming and Liu. Liu takes care of him but allows Er Ming to help out with the business and even exercises with him. It is a touching kinship that seems realistic and not forced. Da Ming is awed by this bond. He has spent so much time away that he is an estranged ""prodigal son.""The biggest strength of this film is it's characterization. There are many wonderful supporting roles in this film. There is the impotent Zhang and his shrewish wife. There are the bickering cricket trainers and fighters (including Mr. Wu who has possibly used illegal substances to beef up his cricket.) There is Miao Zhuang who loves to sing Eduardo Di Capua and Giovanni Capurro's O Sole Mio in the shower. And He Zheng the daydreamer who owes lots of money. I am quite impressed by how well all of their lives are interconnected throughout many of the subplots.Small spoiler in this paragraph: I do no have much to complain about this film (other than the multitude of men's buttocks shown). It would seem that the impending doom of the district, including the bathhouse, to be replaced by a shopping mall would seem a contrite stereotypical plot device but for Beijing and the surrounding areas it is really happening. I did think one scene involving Er Ming and a hospital felt forced and tried to be too emotionally manipulative, but that was probably the only moment that I felt was mediocre..The central theme to this movie is water. There is an emotional flashback scene where Liu talks about Er Ming's mother from the northern province and how much families had to sacrifice just to get enough water for the daughter to take a bath before her wedding day. Water is a purifying force. When Mr. Zhang had problems with impotence it was solved with a special potion and a bath. When Miao Zhuang could not sing in front of the neighborhood, water was used to cure this disorder. Water is also a destructive force. The only death took place in water. Er Ming used a water hose to disrupt a moving party. It is also a healing force: Liu and Da Ming made peace during a storm. In the film water is analogous to life. The wooden plaque at the end of the film sums up the movie with the aqueous statement: ""Heaven Shower's Us With Blessings"".Shower is one of my favorite mainland Chinese films. It is bittersweet, poignant, funny yet emotional complex movie I have watched several times. There is no sugary-sweet ending so it feels more natural. What stays with me though is the memory of the characters and how they remind me of characters that frequent every archaic establishment. Personal note: I may be biased for this film in certain aspects because I used to manage an arcade that was eventually torn down to make way for a larger parking lot. The amount of diverse characters there, like in Shower, was immense.DVD Notes: the only current R1 copy in existence is a Sony Pictures Classics (Columbia Tri-star) version. It is a nice looking copy (anamorphic) that has bare-bones extras featuring only talent files and trailers. I am not sure how good the subtitles are though. They have the habit of writing people's names as one word (Da Ming becomes Daming) which is very annoying. Here is another film that deserves a better release with more extras and possibly a commentary.",5,Heaven Shower's Us With Blessings,1182729600,"06 25, 2007",2007,5612,"['one', 'fastest', 'growing',

560557,A2ZHELQ9MNGBI1,B00004Z1FD,"""smugly""","[12, 13]","This is a really strange, captivating, Chinese movie about an old man and his retarded adult son who run a traditional, men's bathhouse in an old section of Beijing together. A short visit by the old man's other son, who had formerly wanted nothing to do with the business, becomes a longer stay than anyone expected due to circumstances beyond anyone's control.We could say that this is a movie about the encroaching modernization of China and it's impact upon traditional culture, but I came away from my night with the DVD wondering how one goes about putting together a small stable of fighting crickets. If I can figure this out, I'm headed down to Chinatown, looking for a match.This is an interesting, bittersweet movie that is comical in the way that Wertmuller's ""Swept Away"" is comical. The characters are very ""human"" and you will likely empathize with their situations, as I did.

560558,A27A3AZA7L12N6,B00004Z1FD,Stephen M. Bauer,"[6, 10]","This is a straightforward comedy about relationships, human feelings and human spirit.  It is set in a city in modern day northern China.  An older man (Zhu Xu, who starred in The King of Masks) owns a bathhouse.  His son, Er Ming (second son) assists him, who is retarded.  Er Ming is the delight of his father's life.  They both love the bathhouse and all its customers.  For Er Ming, especially, it is his whole world.  Er Ming sends a post card to his brother Da Ming (big brother) who is a businessman is Shenzen, the economic heart of China, in the south.  Da Ming has been estranged from his father for many years.  On the post card, Er Ming, in his primitive way, seemed to indicate to his older brother that their father had passed away.  Da Ming returns, but he discovers that his father is alive.The reason Da Ming is estranged from his father is because he is ashamed of him and the business he runs.  He is ashamed of his father's traditional ways.  Da Ming only respects greed and ruthless capitalism.  The bathhouse is a haven for traditional ways and relationships.  Da Ming is married but did not bring his wife along because he is ashamed of his retarded bother.  One of the interesting contrasts is that although Da Ming is ashamed of his brother Er Ming, the father is ashamed of Da Ming and takes such joy in Er Ming.  And none of the bathhouse customers stigmatize Er Ming.The film is not a downer; it is full of comedy.  There is a bathhouse customer who sings,  ""O Solo Mio,"" (in heavy Mandarin accent) every time he takes a bath.  Later, he teaches the song to Er Ming.  The older customers raise and train crickets for cricket fights, which are held in the bathhouse.  There is constant serious boasting and bragging over who has the toughest cricket.I don't want to give away too much.  Another critic believes that, in the end, Da Ming learns some respect for the old ways.  I did not feel that way.  In the final scene,  Er Ming sings, ""O Solo Mio,"" in the batch house, and I feel it is like a funeral eulogy for tradition.  The capitalist barbarians win.  China has thrown out the baby with the bath water.Although the movie is in Mandarin with subtitles, it can be found in the regular movie racks at the video store.  Lindy liked the movie much, much more than I did.  I think to really appreciate it, one need Chinese cultural roots.  And of course, if you don't know Mandarin Chinese, you have to read the subtitles, which means you can't focus on the pictorial.",3,Wonderfully dramatized conflict of Modern China vs Tradit.,1026604800,"07 14, 2002",2002,2496,"['straightforward', 'comedy', 'relationships', 'human', 'feelings', 'human', 'spirit', 'set', 'city', 'modern', 'day', 'northern', 'China', 'older', 'man', 'Zhu', 'Xu', 'who', 'starred', 'King', 'Masks', 'bathhouse', 'son', 'Er', 'Ming', 'second', 'son', 'who', 'retarded', 'Er', 'Ming', 'delight', 'father', 'life', 'love', 'bathhouse', 'customers', 'Er', 'Ming', 'especially', 'whole', 'world', 'Er', 'Ming', 'post', 'card', 'brother', 'Da', 'Ming', 'big', 'brother', 'who', 'businessman', 'Shenzen', 'economic', 'heart', 'China', 'south', 'Da', 'Ming', 'been', 'estranged', 'father', 'many', 'years', 'post', 'card', 'Er', 'Ming', 'primitive', 'way', 'seemed', 'indicate', 'older', 'brother', 'father', 'had', 'passed', 'away', 'Da', 'Ming', 'returns', 'father', 'alive.The', 'reason', 'Da', 'Ming', 'estranged', 'father', 'ashamed', 'business', 'ashamed', 'father', 'traditional', 'ways', 'Da', 'Ming', 'only', 'greed', 'ruthless', 'capitalism', 'bathhouse', 'haven', 'traditional', 'ways', 'relationships', 'Da', 'Ming', 'married', 'did', 'not', 'bring', 'wife', 'along', 'ashamed', 'retarded', 'bother', 'One', 'interesting', 'contrasts', 'Da', 'Ming', 'ashamed', 'brother', 'Er', 'Ming', 'father', 'ashamed', 'Da', 'Ming', 'such', 'joy', 'Er', 'Ming', 'none', 'bathhouse', 'customers', 'stigmatize', 'Er', 'Ming.The', 'film', 'not', 'downer', 'full', 'comedy', 'bathhouse', 'customer', 'who', 'O', 'Solo', 'Mio', 'heavy', 'Mandarin', 'accent', 'time', 'bath', 'Later', 'song', 'Er', 'Ming', 'older', 'customers', 'raise', 'train', 'crickets', 'cricket', 'fights', 'are', 'held', 'bathhouse', 'constant', 'serious', 'boasting', 'bragging', 'who', 'toughest', 'cricket.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'critic', 'end', 'Da', 'Ming', 'respect', 'old', 'ways', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'way', 'final', 'scene', 'Er', 'Ming', 'sings', 'O', 'Solo', 'Mio', 'batch', 'house', 'feel', 'funeral', 'eulogy', 'tradition', 'capitalist', 'win', 'China', 'thrown', 'out', 'baby', 'bath', 'movie', 'Mandarin', 'subtitles', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'regular', 'movie', 'racks', 'video', 'store', 'Lindy', 'liked', 'movie', 'much', 'much', 'more', 'did', 'think', 'really', 'appreciate', 'one', 'need', 'Chinese', 'cultural', 'roots', 'course', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Mandarin', 'Chinese', 'have', 'read', 'subtitles', 'ca', ""n't"", 'focus', 'pictorial']",N/A
560559,A1RZFX5PRKEXVE,B00004Z1FD,Thomas M. Seay,"[42, 43]","Many Chinese movies understandably focus on the tragic era ofthe Cultural Revolution.  This movie, on the contrary, presents us with the dark side of the &quot;new&quot; China.  Though particular to China, it coincidentally describes a more global picture of a world that pursues money to the detriment of happiness.We immediately get a look at a metaphor for the new China.  A man takes a shower in an efficient public shower, which looks like a mix between a porto-potty and a robo car-wash.  It gets the job done in a short amount of time so that the user can get on with his life as producer and consumer.We then meet the businessman behind the efficient shower.  He is a Chinese yuppie, now living in Shenzhen, but who is presently returning to his hometown because he believes his father, whom he had not visited in a long time, is dead.As it turns out, his father is not dead.  At this point we get a juxtaposition of two worlds.  The new, the yuppies' world which is humorless, lacks warmth and sensuality and the world of his father who runs a public bathouse.  The bathouse, as it turns out, is not only a place where people can ENJOY a bath (and not just get clean) but it serves as a social center where people gather, problems get resolved, and people really care about one another.Alas, the efficient &quot;new&quot; world wins out as a modernization plancalls for the bathhouse to be torn down...and with it the soul of the community.  O sole mio, indeed...but the sun will go down and not rise again any time soon. We are headed towards a joyless efficient world.This is a brilliant movie and I would give it ten stars if possible.Thomas",5,China Loses Its Soul Along with the Rest of Us,1029628800,"08 18, 2002",2002,1653,"['Many', 'Chinese', 'movies', 'understandably', 'focus', 'tragic', 'era', 'ofthe', 'Cultural', 'Revolution', 'movie', 'contrary', 'presents', 'dark', 'side', 'quot', 'new', 'quot', 'China', 'particular', 'China', 'coincidentally', 'more', 'global', 'picture', 'world', 'money', 'detriment', 'happiness.We', 'immediately', 'get', 'look', 'metaphor', 'new', 'China', 'man', 'shower', 'efficient', 'public', 'shower', 'mix', 'porto-potty', 'robo', 'car-wash', 'job', 'done', 'short', 'amount', 'time', 'user', 'can', 'get', 'life', 'producer', 'consumer.We', 'then', 'meet', 'businessman', 'efficient', 'shower', 'Chinese', 'yuppie', 'now', 'living', 'Shenzhen', 'who', 'presently', 'returning', 'hometown', 'father', 'whom', 'had', 'not', 'visited', 'long', 'time', 'dead.As', 'out', 'father', 'not', 'dead', 'point', 'get', 'juxtaposition', 'two', 'worlds', 'new', 'yuppies', 'world', 'humorless', 'warmth', 'sensuality', 'world', 'father', 'who', 'public', 'bathouse', 'bathouse', 'out', 'not', 'only', 'place', 'where', 'people', 'can', 'ENJOY', 'bath', 'not', 'just', 'get', 'clean', 'social', 'center', 'where', 'people', 'gather', 'problems', 'get', 'resolved', 'people', 'really', 'care', 'one', 'another.Alas', 'efficient', 'quot', 'new', 'quot', 'world', 'out', 'modernization', 'bathhouse', 'be', 'torn', 'down', 'soul', 'community', 'O', 'sole', 'mio', 'indeed', 'sun', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'not', 'rise', 'again', 'time', 'soon', 'are', 'headed', 'joyless', 'efficient', 'world.This', 'brilliant', 'movie', 'would', 'give', 'ten', 'stars', 'possible.Thomas']",N/A
