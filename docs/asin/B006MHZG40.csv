1517384,A1249I172VKF50,B006MHZG40,"Joe B ""Joe""","[2, 3]","Here's a TLDR review: This flick is very similar to the Saw franchise (right down to the cover art). It's less bloody but has a parallel theme: an evil super-villain tries to help people by torturing them. As usual, some live and some die.On the up side, the acting is great with top notch directing / cinematography. The sound track is solid and didn't detract from what was happening on screen. Unfortunately, all the talent was wasted because of the script.I have to say 3 stars out of 5 because it just felt like a Saw clone in more ways than I could count. Beyond the stale material, the pacing was quite tedious; yet despite the slow pace, it got confusing because the 6 victims each have an extensive back story. Plus the villain and the investigator-ette have baggage that had to be explained. Overall there wasn't enough emphasis on the main characters and too much screen time was wasted on the supporting cast. Toward the end they try to work in a couple ""twists"" . . . unfortunately those just served to muddle the story even farther.As much as I want to give this 4 stars because of the talent in front of and behind the camera, it is only a 3 star movie.

1517385,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B006MHZG40,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 2]","I really didn't have any specific expectations going into the new thriller ""Die."" Its packaging and cover art makes it look like a straight-to-DVD horror cheapie, so all I could do was hope for the best. I love intense dramas that pit people against one another in psychological combat, and this seemed to be promising just such thrills. And truthfully, within the first few minutes of ""Die,"" I thought I might have discovered a real underground winner. Here's two things that I'll say up-front. One, the visual look of the picture establishes a terrifyingly dark and claustrophobic world that is quite appealing and unsettling. And two, the cast (in its entirety) give exceptional performances throughout. But after creating an effective mood and an intriguing premise, the movie progressively gets more and more outlandish. What starts as creepy morphs into something altogether silly, and it's a classic case of a screenplay trying to go too big. Had the filmmakers focused on the story's more intimate chills, this might have been an effective little sleeper. But by the end, it just had me rolling my eyes with each new revelation.I won't reveal any of the movie's surprises, but the set-up is a promising one. After a well-edited introduction, six people (a nurse, a psychiatrist, a philanthropist, a junkie, a housewife with a gambling problem, and a cop) awake to find themselves prisoner in what appears to be a darkened basement. Soon they meet their captor (a solid John Pyper-Ferguson), who quickly establishes that they will be engaged in life-or-death games whose consequences are largely determined by the roll of a die. And as these initial sessions play out, they have a real intensity! The more mysterious the movie is, the better it works. What is going on? Why were these people chosen? What do they have in common? The story starts to unravel its many mysteries through a series of flashbacks as we get to know more about each victim. So far, so good.As more and more is explained, however, the movie soon starts to lose its footing with any sense of reality. The best parts of the movie are certainly in the basement, but the dangers the captives face grow increasingly complex, unbelievable, and problematic. (Scary when simple, silly when too overdone). The movie is entirely contingent on a controlling power that is truly all-knowing and all-encompassing. You know those movies where the bad guy can be anywhere and everywhere without concern for logic? This is that multiplied by a hundred. But that's not the worst part. I could have lived with this suspension of disbelief had not the movie continued to lose focus. The most painful element in the film is in the outside world where the most inept and empty-headed police investigation is taking place. As the two plot threads occur in tandem, it makes the basement games stretch over several days (conveniently not one of the captives is missed from the real world in any tangible way). And even that's not enough, there is a final revelation (that is hinted at throughout) that raises the stakes to lunatic proportions.In the end, NOTHING makes sense. Bigger is not always better. A taut thriller in the confines of the basement might have worked. The increasingly preposterous plot twists add little and actually took me away from the portion of the film that was mildly successful. Still, there are some nice performances (always good to see Elias Koteas)--but I lost interest and good will in ""Die"" after its very promising beginning.

1517387,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B006MHZG40,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 1]","Die (Dominic James, 2010)There is an oddly compelling, at least to me, subgenre of torture porn that's come to the surface over the last couple of years where instead of the psychotic killer preying on the hapless victims a la Hostel or Turistas or Train or..., instead, the psychotic killer-who's-not-actually-a-killer throws the hapless victims into a room and forces them to do terrible things to each other in exchange for the possibility of winning their freedom. There have been some pretty solid movies along these lines (Nine Dead comes to mind), and of course there have been some awful ones (Vile, The Killing Room, etc.). Die, I am very pleased to report, is of the former camp. We start off with the very title of the film, which is a double-entendre; you can already tell, before you even open the case, that you're dealing with a writer and director (screenwriter Domenico Salvaggio has been James' partner in crime since their first short together, ""Lotto 6/66"") who are head and shoulders above a dozen Darren Lynn Bousmans or Marcus Dunstans. Then we get--hey!--moral dilemmas that are actually interesting, rather than a ""script"" that exists as nothing more than an excuse to showcase Rube Goldberg-esque ways of killing people. (In fact, the methods of death in this movie are quite mundane, which seems to have annoyed some folks on the IMDB boards. I thought that was a strength, rather than a weakness, since it kept the viewer's focus exactly where it should be.)Plot: while I think this was supposed to be a spoiler, it's mentioned in the plot synopses at Netlifx and on the jacket copy. Six people, all of whom were considering, or were in the process of committing, suicide all wake up in some sort of large, dimly-lit room in hastily-constructed plexiglass cages. We have Lisa (Cosmopolis' Emily Hampshire), a compulsive blackjack player who's just lost her life savings. Zach (The Recruit's Karl Pruner), a psychiatrist. Robert (Transgression's Fabio Fulco), a philanthropist and motivational speaker who focuses on helping the clinically depressed. Melody (The Master's Katie Boland), a heroin-addicted teen. Diane (Sigma's Patricia McKenzie), a nurse. And, most importantly--though no one in the room, including the person who brought them there, knows it--Mark (Crash's Elias Koteas), a cop who's seen, and done, far too much to want to continue living. He's important because his disappearance causes his partner, Sofia Valenti (Casino Royale's Caterina Murino), to start connecting the dots that lead to Jacob Odessa (Drive's John Pyper-Ferguson), the man who kidnapped them--and who now pits them against one another, forcing each to use their own method of attempting suicide on one of the others, with the possible lethality determined by the roll of a die. As an example, in the first encounter, Mark, who being a cop was planning on swallowing his revolver, is the game's aggressor, and Robert is the victim. Odessa forces Mark to roll the die; the number that comes up is the number of chambers which will contain bullets in the modified Russian roulette Jacob has them playing. If the hammer doesn't fall on a chamber with a bullet, Robert walks away. If it does, he dies.The moral underpinning of the story, obviously, is right out of the first Saw film; Jigsaw's aim, too, in the early days was to take those who felt their lives had no meaning and teach them the value of living. Such is also Odessa's goal, and his means of achieving it are more mundane, less showy. As I said before, to me, that makes for a stronger work; the audience spends less time waiting for ""he doesn't want us to saw through the chain, he wants us to saw through our ankles!"", and forgetting that the rest of the movie is actually way more interesting. (After all, if they hadn't forgotten that, all seven Saw-franchise movies might actually be well-plotted, well-acted, tense mysteries, rather than movies two through seven going down in infamy as the franchise that started the torture porn movement.) Add to this that James found himself with an exceptional cast, and while he doesn't coax career-best performances out of any of the folks here, the cast handles themselves as well as the cast of Nine Dead did, and that's good enough for yours truly. As many have pointed out, yes, the end of the film is kind of ridiculous and does drag the entire thing down a notch, and there are some really, really weird oversights in the script that I can't help but wonder why no one caught. Still, I was willing to overlook those problems, given how much better this movie is overall than pieces of crap like Vile that tried to tread the same ground and made a dog's dinner of it. I had a great deal of fun with this movie, and I think if you're willing to forgive it some of its odder peccadilloes, you will as well. *** ",4,A very pleasant surprise.,1364342400,"03 27, 2013",2013,4836,"['Die', 'Dominic', 'James', '2010', 'oddly', 'compelling', 'least', 'subgenre', 'torture', 'porn', 'come', 'surface', 'last', 'couple', 'years', 'where', 'instead', 'psychotic', 'killer', 'preying', 'hapless', 'victims', 'la', 'Hostel', 'Turistas', 'Train', 'instead', 'psychotic', ""killer-who's-not-actually-a-killer"", 'hapless', 'victims', 'room', 'forces', 'do', 'terrible', 'things', 'other', 'exchange', 'possibility', 'winning', 'freedom', 'have', 'been', 'pretty', 'solid', 'movies', 'lines', 'Nine', 'Dead', 'mind', 'course', 'have', 'been', 'awful', 'ones', 'Vile', 'Killing', 'Room', 'etc.', 'Die', 'am', 'very', 'pleased', 'report', 'former', 'camp', 'start', 'very', 'title', 'film', 'double-entendre', 'can', 'already', 'tell', 'even', 'open', 'case', ""'re"", 'dealing', 'writer', 'director', 'screenwriter', 'Domenico', 'Salvaggio', 'been', 'James', 'partner', 'crime', 'first', 'short', 'together', 'Lotto', '6/66', 'who', 'are', 'head', 'shoulders', 'dozen', 'Darren', 'Lynn', 'Bousmans', 'Marcus', 'Dunstans', 'Then', 'get', 'hey', 'moral', 'dilemmas', 'are', 'actually', 'interesting', 'rather', 'script', 'nothing', 'more', 'excuse', 'showcase', 'Rube', 'Goldberg-esque', 'ways', 'killing', 'people', 'fact', 'methods', 'death', 'movie', 'are', 'quite', 'mundane', 'have', 'annoyed', 'folks', 'IMDB', 'boards', 'thought', 'was', 'strength', 'rather', 'weakness', 'kept', 'viewer', 'focus', 'exactly', 'where', 'should', 'be', 'Plot', 'think', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'spoiler', 'mentioned', 'plot', 'Netlifx', 'jacket', 'copy', 'Six', 'people', 'whom', 'were', 'considering', 'were', 'process', 'committing', 'suicide', 'wake', 'up', 'sort', 'large', 'dimly-lit', 'room', 'hastily-constructed', 'plexiglass', 'cages', 'have', 'Lisa', 'Cosmopolis', 'Emily', 'Hampshire', 'compulsive', 'blackjack', 'player', 'who', 'just', 'lost', 'life', 'savings', 'Zach', 'Recruit', 'Karl', 'Pruner', 'psychiatrist', 'Robert', 'Transgression', 'Fabio', 'Fulco', 'philanthropist', 'motivational', 'speaker', 'who', 'helping', 'clinically', 'depressed', 'Melody', 'Master', 'Katie', 'Boland', 'heroin-addicted', 'teen', 'Diane', 'Sigma', 'Patricia', 'McKenzie', 'nurse', 'most', 'importantly', 'one', 'room', 'including', 'person', 'who', 'brought', 'there', 'Mark', 'Crash', 'Elias', 'Koteas', 'cop', 'who', 'seen', 'done', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'want', 'continue', 'living', 'important', 'disappearance', 'partner', 'Sofia', 'Valenti', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'Caterina', 'Murino', 'start', 'connecting', 'dots', 'lead', 'Jacob', 'Odessa', 'Drive', 'John', 'Pyper-Ferguson', 'man', 'who', 'kidnapped', 'who', 'now', 'one', 'forcing', 'use', 'own', 'method', 'attempting', 'suicide', 'one', 'others', 'possible', 'lethality', 'determined', 'roll', 'die', 'example', 'first', 'encounter', 'Mark', 'who', 'being', 'cop', 'was', 'planning', 'swallowing', 'revolver', 'game', 'aggressor', 'Robert', 'victim', 'forces', 'Mark', 'roll', 'die', 'number', 'up', 'number', 'chambers', 'will', 'contain', 'bullets', 'modified', 'Russian', 'roulette', 'Jacob', 'playing', 'hammer', ""n't"", 'fall', 'chamber', 'bullet', 'Robert', 'away', 'moral', 'underpinning', 'story', 'obviously', 'right', 'first', 'Saw', 'film', 'Jigsaw', 'aim', 'too', 'early', 'days', 'was', 'take', 'who', 'felt', 'lives', 'had', 'meaning', 'teach', 'value', 'living', 'Such', 'also', 'Odessa', 'goal', 'means', 'achieving', 'are', 'more', 'mundane', 'less', 'showy', 'said', 'before', 'stronger', 'work', 'audience', 'less', 'time', 'waiting', ""n't"", 'want', 'saw', 'chain', 'saw', 'ankles', 'forgetting', 'rest', 'movie', 'actually', 'way', 'more', 'interesting', 'had', ""n't"", 'forgotten', 'seven', 'Saw-franchise', 'movies', 'might', 'actually', 'be', 'well-plotted', 'well-acted', 'tense', 'mysteries', 'rather', 'movies', 'two', 'seven', 'going', 'down', 'infamy', 'franchise', 'started', 'torture', 'porn', 'movement', 'Add', 'James', 'found', 'exceptional', 'cast', ""n't"", 'coax', 'career-best', 'performances', 'folks', 'here', 'cast', 'as', 'well', 'cast', 'Nine', 'Dead', 'did', 'good', 'enough', 'yours', 'truly', 'many', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'yes', 'end', 'film', 'kind', 'ridiculous', 'drag', 'entire', 'thing', 'down', 'notch', 'are', 'really', 'really', 'weird', 'oversights', 'script', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'why', 'one', 'caught', 'Still', 'was', 'willing', 'overlook', 'problems', 'given', 'how', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'overall', 'pieces', 'crap', 'Vile', 'tried', 'tread', 'same', 'ground', 'made', 'dog', 'dinner', 'had', 'great', 'deal', 'fun', 'movie', 'think', ""'re"", 'willing', 'forgive', 'odder', 'peccadilloes', 'will', 'as', 'well', '***']",Die

This means he uses people that are attempting death, salvaging them and giving them his version of a second chance. The people he deals with have some interesting ""how I got here"" tales, and the things that happen to them as tribulations are not random but connect to them personally.Overall, I liked the way it played out. You have rules to the way it is done and, in some ways, they work. There were a few flaws in the way the rules set up, like a 1 might mean a bullet or it might mean taking the first of six of something out and using it. I really thought that could have used more explaining. Then again, I guess the character isn't exactly sane so reason could go out the window. There also is something in the end, with the number six being special, i would like explained. You'd think a six would be terrible, a death sentence, but Jacob notes it as special and then it sort of goes away. Stuff like that is small, but it is nice to know how things work.Die does not have a lot of gore to it and does not get too graphic in its depictions, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. The idea is not about death, but about a second chance if fate, and Jacob, allow it. It also tries to hook some other stuff into it later on, diluted the idea a bit with old cases and a cult, but it still doesn't hurt the film too terrible much.This would be a film I would recommend only for people looking in horror or maybe a little mixed-genre experience. As a horror film, I'd give it a 3.5/5 for that type of experience, saying it falls somewhere between ok and I like it. If you have some time to burn, it isn't a bad view.",4,The Will of the Die,1331596800,"03 13, 2012",2012,2989,"['Six', 'seemingly', 'random', 'strangers', 'find', 'locked', 'glass', 'holding', 'cells', 'two', 'captives', 'wondering', 'just', 'what', 'set', 'motion', 'One', 'minute', 'were', 'home', 'wallowing', 'horrid', 'lives', 'then', 'events', 'brought', 'there', 'What', 'were', 'chances', 'asked', 'captor', 'would', 'probably', 'say', 'something', 'effect', 'just', 'will', 'die', 'introspection', 'playing', 'out', 'questions', 'being', 'asked', 'course', 'tribulations', 'How', 'else', 'can', 'be', 'reborn', 'like', 'horror', 'movies', 'lot', 'enjoy', 'lot', 'films', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'theater', 'have', 'become', 'afraid', 'lot', 'films', 'lately', 'anyone', 'handicam', 'few', 'bucks', 'can', 'make', 'film', 'distribute', 'first', 'had', 'same', 'fear', 'movie', 'turned', 'out', 'was', 'not', 'horror', 'budget', 'flick', 'Watching', 'thankfully', 'found', 'liked', 'Die.As', 'far', 'film', 'quality', 'not', 'bad', 'way', 'plot', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'lots', 'bells', 'whistles', 'be', 'good', 'movie', 'basically', 'deals', 'Jacob', 'way', 'repair', 'lives', 'people', 'repair', 'following', 'will', 'die', 'kid', 'Jacob', 'saw', 'father', 'shoot', 'had', 'son', 'roll', 'number', 'bullets', 'put', 'handgun', 'Now', 'firmly', 'embrace', 'life', 'person', 'needs', 'be', 'right', 'edge', 'demise', 'people', 'are', 'attempting', 'death', 'salvaging', 'giving', 'version', 'second', 'chance', 'people', 'have', 'interesting', 'how', 'got', 'here', 'tales', 'things', 'happen', 'tribulations', 'are', 'not', 'random', 'connect', 'personally.Overall', 'liked', 'way', 'played', 'out', 'have', 'rules', 'way', 'done', 'ways', 'work', 'were', 'few', 'flaws', 'way', 'rules', 'set', 'up', '1', 'might', 'mean', 'bullet', 'might', 'mean', 'taking', 'first', 'six', 'something', 'using', 'really', 'thought', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'more', 'explaining', 'Then', 'again', 'guess', 'character', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'sane', 'so', 'reason', 'could', 'go', 'out', 'window', 'also', 'something', 'end', 'number', 'six', 'being', 'special', 'i', 'would', 'like', 'explained', ""'d"", 'think', 'six', 'would', 'be', 'terrible', 'death', 'sentence', 'Jacob', 'special', 'then', 'sort', 'away', 'Stuff', 'small', 'nice', 'know', 'how', 'things', 'work.Die', 'not', 'have', 'lot', 'gore', 'not', 'get', 'too', 'graphic', 'depictions', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'idea', 'not', 'death', 'second', 'chance', 'fate', 'Jacob', 'allow', 'also', 'hook', 'other', 'stuff', 'later', 'diluted', 'idea', 'bit', 'old', 'cases', 'cult', 'still', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'film', 'too', 'terrible', 'much.This', 'would', 'be', 'film', 'would', 'recommend', 'only', 'people', 'looking', 'horror', 'maybe', 'little', 'mixed-genre', 'experience', 'horror', 'film', ""'d"", 'give', '3.5/5', 'type', 'experience', 'saying', 'somewhere', 'ok', 'like', 'have', 'time', 'burn', ""n't"", 'bad', 'view']",Die
