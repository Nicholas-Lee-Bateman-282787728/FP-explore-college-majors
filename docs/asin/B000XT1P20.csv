1114907,AKT39LK1YS658,B000XT1P20,A. marrero,"[2, 4]","Okay the little boy in this movie is a great actor. The Mama is hot for her age (and I'm a gal.) The guy needed help- serioulsy- but this is all besides the point. This movie was a pretty good movie in exception to the horrible representation of Puerto Ricans- every ethnicity/race has segments in the drug market but the idea that a supposedly educated and intelligent woman would make references- I wish I could quote but I can't-however comments regarding success and how there are stains in the background of everyone who achieves it, comments that say that this money is deserved and well earned because his father earned it selling drugs and that they got this life because of, in a sense, his fathers good character- a good person who cared for them and wanted the best for them and thats why he sold drugs. WTH! The statements on their own are bad enough but the fact that the - ***spoiler here***- father cheated on her and got another girl pregnant (she doesn't know this) further invalidates this claim. The movie would have been great if the mothers character was sensible- but she is supposedly educated yet she has this mentality that is found in the ghetto and that is far from a middle class value- and its not because she came from the ghetto because growing up in one not only was I raised with middle class values but I knew plenty of people who were too. Its sort of like the idea of White Trash- there are (plenty I am sure) poorer Whites with these middle class values who some still consider to be White Trash (because of their social conditions) but then there are those who deviate not only from the majorities class status but also from their ideals. Point being the mom had what I and my friends call ""the ghetto mentality"" and this mentality is by far not a trademark of everyone in this segment- tisk tisk. Thank god that a John Singleton made this movie because if a Puerto Rican had made it I would be ashamed. My main comment I guess would be that if people with deviant ideals annoy you then this film will also. The characters in the film aren't ""ghetto"" by the way its just the moms thought process regarding what is and isn't justifiable to achieve success. As for those of you who expect a movie like Scarface this is far from it- Scarface is way violent and has an in depth view of the ""drug world,"" characteristics not in this movie.",3,"Film has too much of that ""ghetto mentality""",1201910400,"02 2, 2008",2008,2372,"['little', 'boy', 'movie', 'great', 'actor', 'Mama', 'hot', 'age', ""'m"", 'gal', 'guy', 'needed', 'help-', 'serioulsy-', 'point', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'exception', 'horrible', 'representation', 'Puerto', 'Ricans-', 'ethnicity/race', 'segments', 'drug', 'market', 'idea', 'supposedly', 'educated', 'intelligent', 'woman', 'would', 'make', 'references-', 'wish', 'could', 'quote', ""can't-however"", 'comments', 'regarding', 'success', 'how', 'are', 'stains', 'background', 'everyone', 'who', 'comments', 'say', 'money', 'deserved', 'well', 'earned', 'father', 'earned', 'selling', 'drugs', 'got', 'life', 'sense', 'fathers', 'good', 'character-', 'good', 'person', 'who', 'cared', 'wanted', 'best', 'thats', 'why', 'sold', 'drugs', 'WTH', 'statements', 'own', 'are', 'bad', 'enough', 'fact', '***spoiler', 'here***-', 'father', 'cheated', 'got', 'girl', 'pregnant', ""n't"", 'know', 'further', 'claim', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'mothers', 'character', 'was', 'sensible-', 'supposedly', 'educated', 'yet', 'mentality', 'found', 'ghetto', 'far', 'middle', 'class', 'value-', 'not', 'came', 'ghetto', 'growing', 'up', 'one', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'raised', 'middle', 'class', 'values', 'knew', 'plenty', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'too', 'sort', 'idea', 'White', 'Trash-', 'are', 'plenty', 'am', 'sure', 'poorer', 'middle', 'class', 'values', 'who', 'still', 'consider', 'be', 'White', 'Trash', 'social', 'conditions', 'then', 'are', 'who', 'deviate', 'not', 'only', 'majorities', 'class', 'status', 'also', 'ideals', 'Point', 'being', 'mom', 'had', 'what', 'friends', 'call', 'ghetto', 'mentality', 'mentality', 'far', 'not', 'trademark', 'everyone', 'segment-', 'tisk', 'tisk', 'Thank', 'god', 'John', 'Singleton', 'made', 'movie', 'Puerto', 'Rican', 'had', 'made', 'would', 'be', 'ashamed', 'main', 'comment', 'guess', 'would', 'be', 'people', 'deviant', 'ideals', 'annoy', 'then', 'film', 'will', 'also', 'characters', 'film', 'are', ""n't"", 'ghetto', 'way', 'just', 'moms', 'thought', 'process', 'regarding', 'what', ""n't"", 'justifiable', 'achieve', 'success', 'who', 'expect', 'movie', 'Scarface', 'far', 'it-', 'Scarface', 'way', 'violent', 'depth', 'view', 'drug', 'world', 'characteristics', 'not', 'movie']",Illegal Tender
