762147,A1MCTQKWXEG3BR,B0000AC8LM,"David W. Doppes ""Horror god of C-bus""","[5, 5]","In the greatest college football game ever played, Ohio State made the plays at the right time to beat the ""unbeatable"" Miami Hurricanes in multiple overtime periods. This dvd is complete and without commercial interruption.Some things to keep in mind as you watch the game. How bad has Keith Jackson's announcing skills faded? Heres a few quotes from oh nelly. Theres Craig Kressler the quarterback. He has  all of those stars on his helmet. Umm yeah.... Those are Buckeye leaves and his name is Krenzel not Kressler. What a drunk! Keith, buddy you have done about 30 Ohio State games in your career you should know that the logo is not a star, they aren't the Cowboys. Then you have his partner in Miami homer-ism Dan Fouts, whose former team mate Kellen Winslow happens to have his son on the field for Miami. Listen and make it a drinking game for all the times his views lean to the Miami side. Even stating ardently that the pass interference call at the end was horrible, when you can buy a poster of it online showing Chris Gamble being held while the ABC camera guy in full view is still showing Krenzel in  post passing mode , while the ball is on its way to a tangled up Gamble.This game has it all, including a swarming Buckeye defense and a very fast Hurricane defense as well. You can also try to find all the players who later were drafted into the NFL, maybe the most ever for a national title game. Ohio State alone had 15 players drafted in one season following the game- an NFL record. Watch Willis Mcgahee's leg flop around like a slinky after Will Allen ends his college career late in the 3rd period, a not for the faint of heart Theisman-like injury!Another fine viewing tip, don't adjust your tv screen. The stadium is 95% Ohio State fans for a national championship game. Both teams are basically the same distance away from the game site- Arizona. It looked like a home game in the Shoe! And people that were at the game have said that thousands more were outside the stadium.",5,"""The"" Ohio State Buckeyes make Winslow and the small Miami crowd cry!",1139184000,"02 6, 2006",2006,2002,"['greatest', 'college', 'football', 'game', 'ever', 'played', 'Ohio', 'State', 'made', 'plays', 'right', 'time', 'beat', 'unbeatable', 'Miami', 'Hurricanes', 'multiple', 'overtime', 'periods', 'dvd', 'complete', 'commercial', 'interruption.Some', 'things', 'keep', 'mind', 'watch', 'game', 'How', 'bad', 'Keith', 'Jackson', 'announcing', 'skills', 'faded', 'few', 'quotes', 'oh', 'nelly', 'Theres', 'Craig', 'Kressler', 'quarterback', 'stars', 'helmet', 'Umm', 'yeah', 'are', 'Buckeye', 'leaves', 'name', 'Krenzel', 'not', 'Kressler', 'What', 'drunk', 'Keith', 'buddy', 'have', 'done', '30', 'Ohio', 'State', 'games', 'career', 'should', 'know', 'logo', 'not', 'star', 'are', ""n't"", 'Cowboys', 'Then', 'have', 'partner', 'Miami', 'homer-ism', 'Dan', 'Fouts', 'former', 'team', 'mate', 'Kellen', 'Winslow', 'have', 'son', 'field', 'Miami', 'Listen', 'make', 'drinking', 'game', 'times', 'views', 'lean', 'Miami', 'side', 'Even', 'stating', 'ardently', 'pass', 'interference', 'call', 'end', 'was', 'horrible', 'when', 'can', 'buy', 'poster', 'online', 'showing', 'Chris', 'Gamble', 'being', 'held', 'ABC', 'camera', 'guy', 'full', 'view', 'still', 'showing', 'Krenzel', 'post', 'passing', 'mode', 'ball', 'way', 'tangled', 'up', 'Gamble.This', 'game', 'including', 'swarming', 'Buckeye', 'defense', 'very', 'fast', 'Hurricane', 'defense', 'as', 'well', 'can', 'also', 'try', 'find', 'players', 'who', 'later', 'were', 'drafted', 'NFL', 'maybe', 'most', 'ever', 'national', 'title', 'game', 'Ohio', 'State', 'alone', 'had', '15', 'players', 'drafted', 'one', 'season', 'following', 'game-', 'NFL', 'record', 'Watch', 'Willis', 'Mcgahee', 'leg', 'flop', 'slinky', 'Will', 'Allen', 'college', 'career', 'late', '3rd', 'period', 'not', 'faint', 'heart', 'Theisman-like', 'injury', 'fine', 'viewing', 'tip', 'do', ""n't"", 'adjust', 'tv', 'screen', 'stadium', '95', '%', 'Ohio', 'State', 'fans', 'national', 'championship', 'game', 'teams', 'are', 'basically', 'same', 'distance', 'away', 'game', 'site-', 'Arizona', 'looked', 'home', 'game', 'Shoe', 'people', 'were', 'game', 'have', 'said', 'thousands', 'more', 'were', 'stadium']",Ohio State Buckeyes: 2003 Tostitos Fiesta Bowl National Championship

On the other hand, if you are a Miami fan, this will make you shout, ""We wuz robbed,"" especially when you see a certain call by the officials, late in the game.There were no sensational runs or passes--just good football, good defense by both teams.  There is one play I will always remember, when Miami intercepted a pass near the end zone and Maurice Clarett, a true freshman in his only season with Ohio State, actually stole the ball from the defense player for Miami.
