583947,A1N134HXXST079,B00005JHCF,"Baking Enthusiast ""Liza""","[3, 3]","This 1998 Anglia TV adaptation of P. D. James' ""A Certain Justice"" is not as sumptuous in scenery and production values as the more recent BBC ones are, but it is nonetheless an excellent film.  This features actor Roy Marsden who is best known as Lady James' stock character, Commander Adam Dalgliesh of New Scotland Yard.  Mr. Marsden portrayed Dalgliesh for fifteen years and ""A Certain Justice"" was the last James adaptation for him.  I have watched him all throughout the `80s and `90s and have grown very fond of his interpretation of my favorite fictional detective.This particular mystery is set in the English legal community where adversarial matches are not limited to the courts.  Combative Venetia Aldridge, Queen's Counsel, is an ambitious and intelligent lawyer.  She is found murdered in chambers shortly after successfully defending Gary Ashe who's been tried for the stabbing murder of his aunt.  As in most James whodunits, there is no paucity of suspects, from Venetia's colleagues who have axes to grind to those who'd rather see her dead than for her to put another murderer back in the streets.  Venetia's dead body is discovered wearing a judge's horsehair wig that's been doused in blood, the desecration of the body an act of mockery.  Cmdr. Dalgliesh is called upon to investigate the macabre murder and as the investigation deepens, more killings occur.This is Lady James' 10th Dalgliesh novel and there were signs in the book that indicated she was tiring of her sleuth.  For example, in the book, Dalgliesh does not make an appearance until about a third of the way and there seemed to be a remoteness to his participation.  In the adaptation, however, there is no such indication.  This is, in every sense of it, a Dalgliesh film, and a superbly-acted one at that.  It preserves the precise plotting and sardonic style of characterization in the novel, a faithfulness to the source that I appreciate and admire.  The mystery itself is sterling James.  Just when you think you've solved it, you're proved wrong, finding yourself reassessing the facts.The resolution, as jaw-dropping as it is, is partially open-ended.  Even if its logic is unassailable, the viewer may not find complete satisfaction.  I rather prefer it as is and believe it to be more realistic.  Everyday, millions of people seek justice in courts, but the courts are a fallible system.  Justice, we sometimes find, has very little to do with fairness.  Both the book and the film are titled ""A Certain Justice"" and I'm afraid that's all we will get--not an absolute justice, but just a certain justice.[As I'm wont to do, I've included in the Comment section a list of characters and brief notes about each, hopefully, to help.  For those who'd prefer to do without, kindly just skip it.  Also, not meaning to insult anyone's intelligence, there's a phrase that's spoken several times in the film that some American viewers may not be familiar with--""taking silk.""  It refers to being conferred the status of Queen's (or King's) Counsel, when a barrister wears a silk robe amongst other privileges.  Additionally, cases are referred to as Regina vs ______, using the Latin word for queen.]",5,When vengeance isn't left to God,1212192000,"05 31, 2008",2008,3189,"['1998', 'Anglia', 'TV', 'adaptation', 'P.', 'D.', 'James', 'A', 'Certain', 'Justice', 'not', 'as', 'sumptuous', 'scenery', 'production', 'values', 'more', 'recent', 'BBC', 'ones', 'are', 'nonetheless', 'excellent', 'film', 'actor', 'Roy', 'Marsden', 'who', 'best', 'known', 'Lady', 'James', 'stock', 'character', 'Commander', 'Adam', 'Dalgliesh', 'New', 'Scotland', 'Yard', 'Mr.', 'Marsden', 'portrayed', 'Dalgliesh', 'fifteen', 'years', 'Certain', 'Justice', 'was', 'last', 'James', 'adaptation', 'have', 'watched', '80s', '90s', 'have', 'grown', 'very', 'fond', 'interpretation', 'favorite', 'fictional', 'detective.This', 'particular', 'mystery', 'set', 'English', 'legal', 'community', 'where', 'adversarial', 'matches', 'are', 'not', 'limited', 'courts', 'Combative', 'Venetia', 'Aldridge', 'Queen', 'Counsel', 'ambitious', 'intelligent', 'lawyer', 'found', 'murdered', 'chambers', 'shortly', 'successfully', 'defending', 'Gary', 'Ashe', 'who', 'been', 'tried', 'stabbing', 'murder', 'aunt', 'most', 'James', 'whodunits', 'paucity', 'suspects', 'Venetia', 'colleagues', 'who', 'have', 'axes', 'grind', 'who', ""'d"", 'rather', 'see', 'dead', 'put', 'murderer', 'back', 'streets', 'Venetia', 'dead', 'body', 'discovered', 'wearing', 'judge', 'horsehair', 'wig', 'been', 'doused', 'blood', 'desecration', 'body', 'act', 'mockery', 'Cmdr', 'Dalgliesh', 'called', 'investigate', 'macabre', 'murder', 'investigation', 'more', 'killings', 'occur.This', 'Lady', 'James', '10th', 'Dalgliesh', 'novel', 'were', 'signs', 'book', 'indicated', 'was', 'tiring', 'sleuth', 'example', 'book', 'Dalgliesh', 'not', 'make', 'appearance', 'third', 'way', 'there', 'seemed', 'be', 'remoteness', 'participation', 'adaptation', 'however', 'such', 'indication', 'sense', 'Dalgliesh', 'film', 'superbly-acted', 'one', 'precise', 'plotting', 'sardonic', 'style', 'characterization', 'novel', 'faithfulness', 'source', 'appreciate', 'admire', 'mystery', 'sterling', 'James', 'Just', 'when', 'think', ""'ve"", 'solved', ""'re"", 'proved', 'wrong', 'finding', 'reassessing', 'facts.The', 'resolution', 'as', 'jaw-dropping', 'partially', 'open-ended', 'Even', 'logic', 'unassailable', 'viewer', 'may', 'not', 'find', 'complete', 'satisfaction', 'rather', 'prefer', 'believe', 'be', 'more', 'realistic', 'Everyday', 'millions', 'people', 'seek', 'justice', 'courts', 'courts', 'are', 'fallible', 'system', 'Justice', 'sometimes', 'find', 'very', 'little', 'do', 'fairness', 'book', 'film', 'are', 'titled', 'Certain', 'Justice', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'will', 'get', 'not', 'absolute', 'justice', 'just', 'certain', 'justice', ""'m"", 'wont', 'do', ""'ve"", 'included', 'Comment', 'section', 'list', 'characters', 'brief', 'notes', 'hopefully', 'help', 'who', ""'d"", 'prefer', 'do', 'kindly', 'just', 'skip', 'Also', 'not', 'meaning', 'insult', 'anyone', 'intelligence', 'phrase', 'spoken', 'several', 'times', 'film', 'American', 'viewers', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'familiar', 'taking', 'silk', 'being', 'conferred', 'status', 'Queen', 'King', 'Counsel', 'when', 'barrister', 'silk', 'robe', 'other', 'privileges', 'Additionally', 'cases', 'are', 'referred', 'Regina', 'vs', '______', 'using', 'Latin', 'word', 'queen', ']']",P.D.

583950,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,B00005JHCF,Einsatz,"[0, 0]","In A Certain Justice, murder victim Venetia Aldridge (brilliantly played by Penny Downie), is depicted as someone no one is surprised to learn has just been brutally murdered.  Why?  Because she is a dynamic, powerful, ambitious, woman up for a job that few want her to have.  Last time I checked, the attributes Venetia Aldridge effortlessly embodied are arguably expected, encouraged, and tolerated, when part of a man's character.  (That part of the story irked me no end.)  A great portion of the dislike for Venetia stemmed from jealousy, she was simply better at her job than most men are.  Too good in fact, because her last ""winning case"" came home to roost.Most of this `mystery' required a lot of digging into the past.  This involved slow, methodical inquiry hampered by the fact they only had a few suspects.  Roy Marsden, as Adam Dalgliesh, proves to be a languid personality; half the time he seems bored or disinterested in the proceedings (like he's just five minutes from retirement and can't be bothered).  I found that charming in an odd way, most people seemed to underestimate him.  (I have to admit this is my first exposure to the character Dalgliesh and the actor who portrays him.  Having never read anything by P.D. James, I don't know how faithful a rendition this was.)Fortunately, I happen to like all the digging into the past so I didn't mind the dead slow pace.  My only complaint is for one inconvenient murder left untended.  One untidy murder I can handle, two is just plain carelessness on the part of the adaptation (or original author's intent).  Not addressing a possible co-conspiracy charge for aiding and abetting the disposal of a body is too serious to simply present then dismiss without mention.  That too irked me and marred the ending of this ""mystery.""

James murder mystery ""A Certain Justice"". Set in the Old Bailey legal community deep in the heart of London, the victim is a successful but highly unpopular female barrister who is struck down in her office. She has made a lot of enemies in her career as a ruthlessly skilled defense attorney, and this along with the enmity and envy of her associates, make for a cast of memorable characters who have a motive for murder. The plot twists and turns are everything a fan of the ""whodunnit"" style of British mysteries could want. The ending is particularly impressive -- and unpredictable but logically consistent. As is usual with these British productions, the casting is perfect, the settings and sets are impeccably showcased, the dialogue and direction are flawless, and the whole storytelling experience is first rate.

583959,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B00005JHCF,Stephanie De Pue,"[3, 5]","""A Certain Justice,"" a British crime drama, was released in 1999 as a three part television serial, based on ""A Certain Justice,"" by the celebrated, successful British mystery author, Baroness James, better known as PD James. (In the United States, this series ran on many Public Television stations.) The TV serial stars an older-looking Roy Marsden, 15 years into playing the author's best-known character, Commander Adam Dalgleish, sensitive poet/homicide detective, who solves most of her intelligent, complex, atmospheric mysteries. However, the drama was made not by the British Broadcasting Corporation with its generous funds, but rather by Anglia for ITV, which may go to explain the fact that very few of the players are of the well-known, expensive kind. In this courtroom drama, you may only recognize Ian McNiece and Frederick Trewes among the attorneys. And many of the players that surround Marsden are not as expressive as they might be; although, as a matter of trivial interest, Sarah Winman, who played Kate Miskin, is now a best-selling novelist on the strength of her first book,When God Was a Rabbit, which, oddly enough, I've reviewed here.The TV series follows the novel closely. It centers on Venetia Aldridge, QC, as played by the Glasgow-born Phyllida Law, actress inThe Secret World of ArriettyandAlbert Nobbs; director ofThe Iron LadyandMamma Mia! The Movie. At any rate, we can tell that the barrister Venetia is a star of the British legal system because as the action begins, she's defending a murder case in London's historic Old Bailey courthouse, in the hallowed Courtroom I. We're also told by many of her fellow barristers that she's a win at any costs kind of gal, a fact the opening makes clear. She wins acquittal for her client Gary Ashe, one of the most villainous- and psychotic-looking, smirking, unlikable defendants you will ever see. (Although her victory comes as a result of one of the hoariest devices of courtroom drama, the old lady witness who needs new glasses.) However, in what must surely be a repeating nightmare for this sort of attorney, with this sort of client, Ashe is no sooner off the hook than he schemes to get acquainted with Venetia's dumb, snippy, hard-to-take daughter Octavia, who's just dropped out of convent school. The young couple's doings will be the major subplot driving the film to its suspenseful conclusion.Venetia, who has her chambers in one of London's historic Inns of Court, is all-around abrasive. In her professional life, to her fellow attorneys and the chambers' staff; in her personal life to her housekeeper, her daughter, and her married lover, who's itching to end the affair. One morning she's found dead, stabbed with her own letter opener. The murderer, or another party, has placed a judge's wig on her head, and spilled a third party's blood over her. When Dalgleish is called to investigate, he has an embarrassment of candidates to consider.The acting is good, and Marsden is still finding nuances in Dalgleish. Mood and atmosphere are nicely set. The Inns of Court are portrayed in all their Dickensian glory, black robes, wigs and all. As a matter of fact, at one point Venetia verbally abuses a chambers' clerk, telling him that if Dickens were to return, that famous Victorian writer would recognize the dilatory employee.In the manner of many British mystery shows, the episodes move slowly, no car chases to wake us up. The series is dark in its outlook, a downer, the three main characters, almost all the characters, are unlikable, and it's hard to care much about them. Furthermore, it's probable that none of the murders we are presented, particularly Venetia's, will ever come to court, giving us an emotionally unsatisfying ending in which, echoing the irony of the work's title, only a rough justice is achieved.",3,Only a Rough Uncertain Justice Is Achieved,1176508800,"04 14, 2007",2007,3828,"['Certain', 'Justice', 'British', 'crime', 'drama', 'was', 'released', '1999', 'three', 'part', 'television', 'serial', 'based', 'A', 'Certain', 'Justice', 'celebrated', 'successful', 'British', 'mystery', 'author', 'Baroness', 'James', 'better', 'known', 'PD', 'James', 'United', 'States', 'series', 'ran', 'many', 'Public', 'Television', 'stations', 'TV', 'serial', 'older-looking', 'Roy', 'Marsden', '15', 'years', 'playing', 'author', 'best-known', 'character', 'Commander', 'Adam', 'Dalgleish', 'sensitive', 'poet/homicide', 'detective', 'who', 'most', 'intelligent', 'complex', 'atmospheric', 'mysteries', 'However', 'drama', 'was', 'made', 'not', 'British', 'Broadcasting', 'Corporation', 'generous', 'funds', 'rather', 'Anglia', 'ITV', 'may', 'go', 'explain', 'fact', 'very', 'few', 'players', 'are', 'well-known', 'expensive', 'kind', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'may', 'only', 'recognize', 'Ian', 'McNiece', 'Frederick', 'Trewes', 'attorneys', 'many', 'players', 'surround', 'Marsden', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'expressive', 'might', 'be', 'matter', 'trivial', 'interest', 'Sarah', 'Winman', 'who', 'played', 'Kate', 'Miskin', 'now', 'best-selling', 'novelist', 'strength', 'first', 'book', 'When', 'God', 'Was', 'Rabbit', 'oddly', 'enough', ""'ve"", 'reviewed', 'here.The', 'TV', 'series', 'novel', 'closely', 'Venetia', 'Aldridge', 'QC', 'played', 'Glasgow-born', 'Phyllida', 'Law', 'actress', 'inThe', 'Secret', 'World', 'ArriettyandAlbert', 'Nobbs', 'director', 'Iron', 'LadyandMamma', 'Mia', 'Movie', 'rate', 'can', 'tell', 'barrister', 'Venetia', 'star', 'British', 'legal', 'system', 'action', 'defending', 'murder', 'case', 'London', 'historic', 'Old', 'Bailey', 'courthouse', 'hallowed', 'Courtroom', ""'re"", 'also', 'told', 'many', 'fellow', 'barristers', 'win', 'costs', 'kind', 'gal', 'fact', 'opening', 'clear', 'acquittal', 'client', 'Gary', 'Ashe', 'one', 'most', 'villainous-', 'psychotic-looking', 'smirking', 'unlikable', 'defendants', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'victory', 'result', 'one', 'hoariest', 'devices', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'old', 'lady', 'witness', 'who', 'new', 'glasses', 'However', 'what', 'must', 'surely', 'be', 'repeating', 'nightmare', 'sort', 'attorney', 'sort', 'client', 'Ashe', 'sooner', 'hook', 'get', 'acquainted', 'Venetia', 'dumb', 'snippy', 'hard-to-take', 'daughter', 'Octavia', 'who', 'just', 'dropped', 'convent', 'school', 'young', 'couple', 'doings', 'will', 'be', 'major', 'subplot', 'driving', 'film', 'suspenseful', 'conclusion.Venetia', 'who', 'chambers', 'one', 'London', 'historic', 'Inns', 'Court', 'all-around', 'abrasive', 'professional', 'life', 'fellow', 'attorneys', 'chambers', 'staff', 'personal', 'life', 'housekeeper', 'daughter', 'married', 'lover', 'who', 'itching', 'end', 'affair', 'One', 'morning', 'found', 'dead', 'stabbed', 'own', 'letter', 'opener', 'murderer', 'party', 'placed', 'judge', 'wig', 'head', 'spilled', 'third', 'party', 'blood', 'When', 'Dalgleish', 'called', 'investigate', 'embarrassment', 'candidates', 'consider.The', 'acting', 'good', 'Marsden', 'still', 'finding', 'nuances', 'Dalgleish', 'Mood', 'atmosphere', 'are', 'nicely', 'set', 'Inns', 'Court', 'are', 'portrayed', 'Dickensian', 'glory', 'black', 'robes', 'wigs', 'matter', 'fact', 'one', 'point', 'Venetia', 'verbally', 'chambers', 'clerk', 'telling', 'Dickens', 'were', 'return', 'famous', 'Victorian', 'writer', 'would', 'recognize', 'dilatory', 'manner', 'many', 'British', 'mystery', 'shows', 'episodes', 'move', 'slowly', 'car', 'wake', 'up', 'series', 'dark', 'outlook', 'downer', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'almost', 'characters', 'are', 'unlikable', 'hard', 'care', 'much', 'Furthermore', 'probable', 'none', 'murders', 'are', 'presented', 'particularly', 'Venetia', 'will', 'ever', 'come', 'court', 'giving', 'emotionally', 'unsatisfying', 'ending', 'echoing', 'irony', 'work', 'title', 'only', 'rough', 'justice', 'achieved']",P.D.
