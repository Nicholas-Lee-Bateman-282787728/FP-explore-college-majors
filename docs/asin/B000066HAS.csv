701539,A2RQYLOWN92CCK,B000066HAS,A Customer,"[2, 3]","It's always interesting to watch a good actor thinking in a close-up, but here it's particularly fascinating. As Sam, Penn thinks with all his might -- and moves very slowly. Sometimes, when he talks, we can see the moment where his thoughts go off track and he becomes lost. At other times, we see him struggling to find the words to express a complicated feeling.Early in the movie, there is a quiet moment when his daughter (Dakota Fanning), whom he is raising alone, asks him why he is not like other kids' daddies. She has reached the age at which she can tell the difference, and a wonderful look of dawning uncertainty moves across Penn's face. He has worried about this moment.The story of &quot;I Am Sam&quot; centers on a court case. The county decides that Sam is incapable of raising his daughter and takes her away from him. Sam, with incredible luck, manages to get himself a high-powered attorney, played by Michelle Pfeiffer as a beautifully coiffed, over-caffeinated type-triple-A train wreck. The litigation goes on for the length of the movie, but &quot;I Am Sam&quot; is no &quot;Philadelphia,&quot; in which one side is clearly right and the other wrong.Instead, &quot;I Am Sam&quot; does two important things. It makes it absolutely clear that Sam is a loving father. Penn's scenes with Fanning -- who is bright, big- eyed and adorable -- are touching in the way Sam so easily connects with a child's mind. He's like a real-live teddy bear. At the same time, the movie makes it absolutely unclear whether Sam really is capable of adequately raising this child through adolescence and into adulthood. &quot;I Am Sam&quot; is not about the justice or injustice of the legal system. Rather it's about the tragedy of Sam's predicament.By refusing to make the social workers into villains, and by never succumbing to the temptation to give Sam an improbable moment of lucidity or insight, the filmmakers avoid two obvious traps. But they put themselves into a less obvious trap with regard to plot. Sam is never going to change. So any plot motion has to come from another character.Two-thirds of the way in, &quot;I Am Sam&quot; comes to a standstill. Desperate for forward motion of any kind, the movie starts concentrating on the relationship between the hard-driving attorney and Sam. The idea is that somehow, just by being in contact with Sam's loving nature, the attorney is forced to confront the shallowness of her existence. It's the script's one blast of insincerity, but it's a big one, and Pfeiffer has the burden of trying to carry it off. In one scene, she breaks down in tears as she unburdens herself to him about her miserable life. It's hard not to cringe, watching this emotionally ready actress fling herself headlong into false material.Most of the last part of &quot;I Am Sam&quot; is made up of inconclusive scenes, followed by long and overused musical interludes featuring Beatles songs. Yet just when &quot;I Am Sam&quot; seems about ready to descend into the very stickiness and sentimentality it had managed to avoid, the movie rescues itself -- by knowing when to end.Director Jessie Nelson has made a stylish picture from a screenplay she wrote with Kristine Johnson. In moments of tension, she uses a staccato zoom effect -- moving in on actors' faces in abrupt increments. It creates an unsettled quality. Yet more impressive is her handling of the court scenes, in which she gives us a peek into Sam's childlike perspective by showing us how he sees the proceedings.",5,I Am Perfect!,1029974400,"08 22, 2002",2002,3517,"['always', 'interesting', 'watch', 'good', 'actor', 'thinking', 'close-up', 'here', 'particularly', 'fascinating', 'Sam', 'Penn', 'might', 'moves', 'very', 'slowly', 'Sometimes', 'when', 'can', 'see', 'moment', 'where', 'thoughts', 'go', 'off', 'track', 'lost', 'other', 'times', 'see', 'struggling', 'find', 'words', 'express', 'complicated', 'feeling.Early', 'movie', 'quiet', 'moment', 'when', 'daughter', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'whom', 'raising', 'alone', 'why', 'not', 'other', 'kids', 'daddies', 'reached', 'age', 'can', 'tell', 'difference', 'wonderful', 'look', 'dawning', 'uncertainty', 'moves', 'Penn', 'face', 'worried', 'moment.The', 'story', 'quot', 'Am', 'Sam', 'quot', 'centers', 'court', 'case', 'county', 'Sam', 'incapable', 'raising', 'daughter', 'away', 'Sam', 'incredible', 'luck', 'get', 'high-powered', 'attorney', 'played', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'beautifully', 'coiffed', 'over-caffeinated', 'type-triple-A', 'train', 'wreck', 'litigation', 'length', 'movie', 'quot', 'Am', 'Sam', 'quot', 'quot', 'Philadelphia', 'quot', 'one', 'side', 'clearly', 'right', 'other', 'wrong.Instead', 'quot', 'Am', 'Sam', 'quot', 'two', 'important', 'things', 'absolutely', 'clear', 'Sam', 'loving', 'father', 'Penn', 'scenes', 'Fanning', 'who', 'bright', 'big-', 'eyed', 'adorable', 'are', 'touching', 'way', 'Sam', 'easily', 'connects', 'child', 'mind', 'real-live', 'teddy', 'bear', 'same', 'time', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'unclear', 'Sam', 'really', 'capable', 'adequately', 'raising', 'child', 'adolescence', 'adulthood', 'quot', 'Am', 'Sam', 'quot', 'not', 'justice', 'injustice', 'legal', 'system', 'tragedy', 'Sam', 'predicament.By', 'refusing', 'make', 'social', 'workers', 'villains', 'never', 'succumbing', 'temptation', 'give', 'Sam', 'improbable', 'moment', 'lucidity', 'insight', 'filmmakers', 'avoid', 'two', 'obvious', 'traps', 'put', 'less', 'obvious', 'trap', 'regard', 'plot', 'Sam', 'never', 'going', 'change', 'plot', 'motion', 'come', 'character.Two-thirds', 'way', 'quot', 'Am', 'Sam', 'quot', 'standstill', 'Desperate', 'forward', 'motion', 'kind', 'movie', 'concentrating', 'relationship', 'hard-driving', 'attorney', 'Sam', 'idea', 'somehow', 'just', 'being', 'contact', 'Sam', 'loving', 'nature', 'attorney', 'forced', 'confront', 'shallowness', 'existence', 'script', 'one', 'blast', 'insincerity', 'big', 'one', 'Pfeiffer', 'burden', 'trying', 'carry', 'off', 'one', 'scene', 'down', 'tears', 'miserable', 'life', 'hard', 'not', 'cringe', 'watching', 'emotionally', 'ready', 'actress', 'fling', 'headlong', 'false', 'material.Most', 'last', 'part', 'quot', 'Am', 'Sam', 'quot', 'made', 'inconclusive', 'scenes', 'followed', 'long', 'overused', 'musical', 'interludes', 'featuring', 'Beatles', 'songs', 'just', 'when', 'quot', 'Am', 'Sam', 'quot', 'ready', 'descend', 'very', 'stickiness', 'sentimentality', 'had', 'managed', 'avoid', 'movie', 'knowing', 'when', 'end.Director', 'Jessie', 'Nelson', 'made', 'stylish', 'picture', 'screenplay', 'wrote', 'Kristine', 'Johnson', 'moments', 'tension', 'staccato', 'zoom', 'effect', 'moving', 'actors', 'abrupt', 'increments', 'unsettled', 'quality', 'more', 'impressive', 'handling', 'court', 'scenes', 'peek', 'Sam', 'childlike', 'perspective', 'showing', 'how', 'proceedings']",I am Sam

I absolutely adore this film, and boy Fanning really steals the show, this was her first big performance. Penn and Pfeiffer have great chemistry and you can feel their pain and anguish and both of them come from different backgrounds, but equally they share heartaches just like everyone else. This is one of those films that tug at your heartstrings, so real, so candid, and truly captivating from beginning to end. I also recommend the soundtrack to the film, it contains great covers of Beatles songs.

701541,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B000066HAS,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[1, 1]","I did cry during this film.  There, I got it out there in the open so that it wouldn't hold me back as I talked about how great of a cinematic journey I Am Sam was.  I remember when this film was released and how disgusted I was to hear that Sean Penn was taking the role of a mentally challenged individual because I am under the utter beliefs that if you want realism in your film, just hire someone who faces it daily.  I didn't see the point of getting Sean Penn to over dramatize it.  I am here to say that I was wrong.  For once, I think Sean Penn was the perfect choice for this film.  Yet, it wasn't just Penn that made this film worth more than one viewing.  I believe that director Jessie Nelson realized that she had a clich&eacute; Hollywood story on her hands, in fact just another retelling of Kramer vs. Kramer (which is referenced throughout the film), and needed to do something to set it apart from the rest.  Her answer, Beatles songs, imaginative cinematography, and gathering the best of the best to tackle her main characters.  While Michelle Pfeiffer seemed to be an odd fit, the rest fell into place beautifully.  Let me say this now, Dakota Fanning will win Oscars (more than one) during her film career.  Needless to say, this was a much better film that initially represented.  I Am Sam is one of those movies that we assume will be just like every other Hollywood outing, but until you open the box, put the DVD into your player, and experience the music, the visuals, as well as the phenomenal acting; you will never quite understand why I Am Sam carried above the Hollywood standard.On the apparent level, I Am Sam works because of Sean Penn.  As I watch more and more of this actor's body of work, I cannot help but be continually impressed.  Penn brings more to the screen than any other actor could imagine.  His presence, in my eyes, dwarfs Hanks and Cruise phenomenon.  Penn is constantly surprising us with challenging roles that fluctuate between light and dark.  He is not focused on one genre, but always impressing with his ability to move between films.  One will never quite know what he has in his back pocket until we see him on screen.  He is that impressive.  I believe that it was also the aid of Dakota Fanning which gave Penn the strength to be the character that he was.  For her first feature film, Fanning came out with the prose and professionalism that has nearly gone missing in Hollywood.  She stood up, worked with Penn like they had been companions for a lifetime, and succeeded in giving us the emotion this film desperately deserved.  She was an element of I Am Sam that was needed to bring a human element to Sam, and she did it with the greatest of ease.  I can say the same about everyone else in the film to those that played Sam's friends, to Diane Wiest, to even Laura Dern.  They all created an ensemble cast that brought emotion, humility, and sincerity to this film.  Alas, I just can't say the same for Michelle Pfeiffer.  I thought her role in this film was too dramatic; she seemed to be the only one that fit within the clich&eacute; walls, and just seemed to be a bit miscast.  There was a level of annoyance with her as well.  The lawyer that leans more about herself through her client was just too much for me.  I think if she just played herself being a lawyer, than it would have worked better.  She tried to hard to counter Penn's brilliance, and it didn't work.  Fanning did it exceptionally well, but Pfeiffer seemed too familiar.  I know we could have expected more from her, the sad thing is, we didn't get it in this film.There are two other elements of I Am Sam that nearly knocked me off the couch because I wasn't expecting them.  The first was the cinematography which added a very artistic element to this film.  The cut scenes added a new level of humanity to everyone involved, while the choice of colors for different moments really added to the raw emotion of the film.  This wasn't your typical film where it was the stagnate colors and straight-forward camera work, this was a movie that took unfamiliar leaps with the camera, choosing to use darkened colors for the courtroom scenes, and lightened colors for the moments between Penn and Fanning.  This is much different than your typical courtroom film.  I thought this idea worked brilliantly to bring a defined tone to the film.  Coupled with the fabulous and detailed Beatles' music that was used with superb accuracy, I Am Sam transformed into more than what I was ready for.  I read that Penn was influential in getting the Beatles' music for the film, and the choice to use one band to compliment the film was yet another tool not used often in cinema.  Again, I Am Sam took risks, and it is those risks (like the music and cinematography) that took this a-typical film into a whole new galaxy.Overall, I thought this was a surprising film.  I was not expecting the level of superiority that I witnessed when I watched this movie.  I was expecting your typical courtroom drama with Sean Penn befouling a character that he had no right to play.  I am nearly certain his portrayal here should have won him the Oscar over Denzel.  One should watch this for more than just the acting, the music and cinematography add a level of professionalism and creativity to overall themes.  Again, I cannot state it enough, I was not expecting this film at all.  What the box indicated and what the final result really was, two completely different ideas.  The only negative I have is Pfeiffer, but she can be easily overshadowed by Fanning and Penn if you get too deeply into this film.  I highly suggest this film to anyone as a more than once viewing.  I think you will be just as surprised/shocked as I was!!Grade: ***** out of *****",5,Do we get balloons?,1158451200,"09 17, 2006",2006,5776,"['did', 'cry', 'film', 'got', 'out', 'there', 'open',

So I was mentally prepared for this movie going in.  I've always had a soft spot for stories involving an underdog who proves the world wrong and betters it in the process.In this film Sean Penn plays a retarded father to a seven year old daughter whose mental capacity is slowly exceeding his.  Ironically, it's the daughter that leads to the involvement of Child Services in a protracted legal battle for Sean Penn's rights to raise her daughter.I think the cast was well chosen.  Sean Penn plays the mentally-challenged role very well.  (Hence an Oscar nomination.)  Dakota Fanning did a magnificent job portraying the daughter.  When the camera looks into her eyes, the audience just melts.  Michelle Pfeiffer's bitchy career-driven lawyer act went smoothly.This film was both sad and touching to me.

Unless you're watching with a critical eye (and let's face it, you can find something wrong with any movie if you try hard enough), this movie is superior in every way. The casting is top notch.

701546,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000066HAS,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","To say that `I am Sam' is not moving, stirring and heartbreaking would be a bold faced lie.  Truth be told, this movie made me bawl, and I am not ashamed to say that.  To say that this is an accurate depiction of the challenges of the mentally handicapped would also be a bold faced lie, for `I am Sam' is really a text book example of how Hollywood always tends to sink its sentimental claws into everything that is honest and pure.  Instead of delivering a plausible or even remotely relatable account, `I am Sam' borders on preposterous, at times jumping right over the fence and running full speed ahead at the forest of ridiculousness.That said, I still cry every time.Here we have the story of Sam Dawson, a mentally handicapped middle aged man who spends his days working at Starbucks and his evenings taking care of his daughter.  Yes, Sam has a child, who was bore to him by a homeless woman who left him moments after Lucy (named Lucy Diamond Dawson after the Beatles song) was born.  Sam has done a fine job raising Lucy with the help of friends and neighbors, but after a slew of misunderstandings raise concern over Sam's ability to remain a suitable parent, Lucy is removed from Sam's home and he finds himself struggling to fight for custody.As many have noted both here on this site and critically when the film was released, the plot for this film is preposterous and even borders offensive at times.  It's depiction of the handicapped is rather one-note, and the entire eclipsed prose is rather unbelievable.What does make sense is the stupendous acting.Yes, what makes `I am Sam' worth a watch is the magnificent performances by the entire cast.  Sean Penn, an actor who is rather hit-or-miss with me, soars as Sam.  Yes, his performance can at times appear desperate (he does `overdo' it a tad) but it also comes off very genuine and sincere.  He suffers a bit because of the heavyhanded and often saccharine scripting, especially in the courtroom scenes, but he never loses the sincerity in his eyes.  Michelle Pfeiffer is also genuine and engaging as Rita, Sam's reluctant lawyer.  She is able to reach levels of understanding within her character that could have easily gone overlooked.And then there is Dakota Fanning, totally snubbed of an Oscar nomination and brimming with brilliance as young Lucy.  Her heartfelt and utterly devastating portrayal of a young child in love with a father who she is being told in incapable of loving her is just dynamic to say the least.  She proves here beyond a shadow of a doubt that she has what it takes to become one of the biggest stars we'll ever see.In the end I cannot say that `I am Sam' is a bad film, because I actually really like this movie.  But I can say that when taken apart and looked at on the films merit alone, it is really poorly constructed.  The script is filled with holes and improbabilities that reflect poorly on the overall impact the film is supposed to have.  But, the film is delivered in such a way that those inconsistencies are easily ignored.  The performances are so raw and invested that one fails to see the films many faults until later, when he or she has a chance to truly reflect on the film as a whole.  So, sit back and enjoy this beautiful story, just don't take it too seriously.",3,The magnificent performances help dull the films preposterousness...,1224201600,"10 17, 2008",2008,3287,"['say', 'am', 'Sam', 'not', 'moving', 'stirring', 'heartbreaking', 'would', 'be', 'bold', 'faced', 'lie', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'movie', 'made', 'bawl', 'am', 'not', 'ashamed', 'say', 'say', 'accurate', 'depiction', 'challenges', 'mentally', 'handicapped', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'bold', 'faced', 'lie', 'am', 'Sam', 'really', 'text', 'book', 'example', 'how', 'Hollywood', 'always', 'sink', 'sentimental', 'claws', 'everything', 'honest', 'pure', 'Instead', 'delivering', 'plausible', 'even', 'remotely', 'relatable', 'account', 'am', 'Sam', 'borders', 'preposterous', 'times', 'jumping', 'right', 'fence', 'running', 'full', 'speed', 'ahead', 'forest', 'ridiculousness.That', 'said', 'still', 'cry', 'time.Here', 'have', 'story', 'Sam', 'Dawson', 'mentally', 'handicapped', 'middle', 'aged', 'man', 'who', 'days', 'working', 'Starbucks', 'evenings', 'taking', 'care', 'daughter', 'Yes', 'Sam', 'child', 'who', 'was', 'bore', 'homeless', 'woman', 'who', 'left', 'moments', 'Lucy', 'named', 'Lucy', 'Diamond', 'Dawson', 'Beatles', 'song', 'was', 'born', 'Sam', 'done', 'fine', 'job', 'raising', 'Lucy', 'help', 'friends', 'neighbors', 'slew', 'misunderstandings', 'raise', 'concern', 'Sam', 'ability', 'remain', 'suitable', 'parent', 'Lucy', 'removed', 'Sam', 'home', 'struggling', 'fight', 'custody.As', 'many', 'have', 'noted', 'here', 'site', 'critically', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'plot', 'film', 'preposterous', 'even', 'borders', 'offensive', 'times', 'depiction', 'handicapped', 'rather', 'one-note', 'entire', 'eclipsed', 'prose', 'rather', 'unbelievable.What', 'make', 'sense', 'stupendous', 'acting.Yes', 'what', 'am', 'Sam', 'worth', 'watch', 'magnificent', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'actor', 'who', 'rather', 'hit-or-miss', 'Sam', 'Yes', 'performance', 'can', 'times', 'appear', 'desperate', 'overdo', 'tad', 'also', 'off', 'very', 'genuine', 'sincere', 'bit', 'heavyhanded', 'often', 'saccharine', 'scripting', 'especially', 'courtroom', 'scenes', 'never', 'sincerity', 'eyes', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'also', 'genuine', 'engaging', 'Rita', 'Sam', 'reluctant', 'lawyer', 'able', 'reach', 'levels', 'understanding', 'character', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'gone', 'overlooked.And', 'then', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'totally', 'snubbed', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'brimming', 'brilliance', 'young', 'Lucy', 'heartfelt', 'utterly', 'devastating', 'portrayal', 'young', 'child', 'love', 'father', 'who', 'being', 'told', 'incapable', 'loving', 'just', 'dynamic', 'say', 'least', 'here', 'shadow', 'doubt', 'what', 'become', 'one', 'biggest', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see.In', 'end', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'am', 'Sam', 'bad', 'film', 'actually', 'really', 'movie', 'can', 'say', 'when', 'taken', 'apart', 'looked', 'films', 'merit', 'alone', 'really', 'poorly', 'constructed', 'script', 'filled', 'holes', 'improbabilities', 'reflect', 'poorly', 'overall', 'impact', 'film', 'supposed', 'have', 'film', 'delivered', 'such', 'way', 'inconsistencies', 'are', 'easily', 'ignored', 'performances', 'are', 'so', 'raw', 'invested', 'one', 'see', 'films', 'many', 'faults', 'later', 'when', 'chance', 'truly', 'reflect', 'film', 'whole', 'So', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'beautiful', 'story', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously']",I am Sam

She did not want to be a mother. Sam loves the idea of being a father, but he has the mind of a 7-year-old. He names the baby Lucy Diamond Dawson, after Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds. And with some bemusement, he takes on the job of being a single father, while he works at Starbucks for minimum wage to support himself and his daughter.But before long it is obvious that Lucy (Dakota Fanning) has grown smarter than her Dad (I did that, too, but it took me a little longer), even to the point of being afraid to learn things he doesn't know. In a touching scene where she is reading to him, she intentionally stumbles over a word he had stumbled over earlier when he attempted to read the book to her. She declares she does not want that book, and they go back to Green Eggs and Ham, which Sam can read. (In fact, it's the origin of the movie's title.)Inevitably, they come to the attention of Child Protective Services, and Lucy is placed in foster care. They have two-hour supervised visits every other week, which is nowhere near enough for either Sam or Lucy. Enter attorney Rita Harrison Williams (Michelle Pfeiffer) who is shanghied into taking Sam's case pro bono.One face you may recognize is Mr. Turner, the attorney for CPS, who is played to perfection by Richard Schiff. You will no doubt recognize him as the curmudgeon in the West Wing.No real villains here, unless it is the system itself.

Nothing, not even how and when to feed the infant or how to change her diaper.Jump to eight years later. The child is brilliant. She's a straight A student who suddenly starts doing poorly in school. Her grades fail dramatically. Why? She finally admits to papa, who struggles to read Dr. Seuss books, that she's ashamed to be smarter than her father. Gag me, please.For reasons I won't state, Sam loses custody of his daughter. The State sees him as an unfit parent. After eight years? After he's supposedly raised a prodigy child from infancy all by himself? Sam retains the help of a lawyer (Michelle Pfeiffer)to win his daughter back.I won't reveal the ending, but it isn't hard to figure out, nor is it even remotely interesting.",1,Dud.

If you want realism, visit the family law department at your neighborhood courthouse. Notwithstanding the drama, the legal process was substantially realistic to the extent it touched on the various phases. The plot was tightly drawn. Delivery was compelling and very entertaining. Excellent acting from ALL actors, brilliant scriptwork (especially good for Penn's role), gelled in a near PERFECT blend of production, camera,video work and music (for those '60 and '70 era kids, and to all the knowing and appreciative, the Beatles theme and on-spot songs gave this film sanctimonious flight. ALL the actors were at or close to the top of their game. A fluid, albeit slightly lengthy, masterpiece of acting and production. Sean Penn as Sam, a mentally handicapped single father, struggles with the system over legal issues pursuant to his capacity to properly raise his young daughter. The excruciating degree of physical and mental demands inherent in the successful execution of this role of Sam, as played so near-perfectly by Penn, cannot be overstated. Penn's acting in this role further substantiates his genius for consistent excellent acting and glues him toe to toe with Cruise and Hanks. Penn is to be lauded for a remarkable acheivement in bringing Sam to optimal life. Michelle Pfieffer was exciting, perpetually combustible and really fun to watch. Dakota Fanning was brilliant. ALL the actors, including the second and third support tiers, had relative depth of character calibrated and cured to perfection. Somewhere in the background there is a wonderful stage - prop -  crew at the helm - superb professionals who know their stuff. All flaws remain strictly subjective, have mostly to do with an occasional illogical snafu (such as the supposedly 'perfectly responsible foster parents' permitting Lucy the wherewithall to sneak out of the house (again?) after she's caught wandering the streets to her father's house, and upon discovering this unnverving fact the parents display insufficient shock. Other minor quirks were to be found such as slight disruptions in the intellectual continuity of Penn's charcter revealed by some illogical upshifts in intellectual overage, such as Penn's eyes are too normal, calm and intelligent (noticeably out of character) when Pffifer breaks the door down in a huff and finds him serene behind his cutouts (breaking the door down should have triggered a little rapid eye movement) and a few more spurts of slight intellectual overage is mainly due to script and Penn reverting back to himself mid-scene for several quick but noticeable seconds.  Also it could be argued that Lucy's maturity in later scenes pushed slightly ahead of her years, unless she was endowed with abnormally superior intellect which could have very well been the case.  As such, these are all trifling criticisms and they make little stew for studious topic. This is an intense emotional feel good movie, not a dusty documentary - lovingly steeped in a rich movie flair.",5,"PHENOMENAL!

Sean Penn does another one of his top of the line acting jobs whereas Michelle Pfeiffer gives the performance of her career as the lawyer who really doesn't want his case.  If you don't know any retarded people, divorce lawyers, agoraphobiacs, prosecutors, foster parents or social workers, then you may feel this film is off the mark.  Having worked as a divorce lawyer for a decade though, I can tell you this film is spot on to both the system and people it portrays. If you have any lingering doubts about Penn's acting abilities, you should view back to back this film, ""Carlito's Way,"" ""Dead Man Walking"" ""She's So Lovely"" and ""Sweet and Low Down."" Penn is totally convincing in each as a 1) retarded man who is father of bright daughter, 2) coke addled criminal defense attorney, 3) convinct about to be executed for rape and murder who connects with a nun, 4) man in marginal existence with wife, due to mental illness, who acts out in violence one night and consequences that ensue 5) wholly self absorbed, brilliant jazz musician. I've read that he never wins the Oscar because although the members of the Academy love his work, they hate him personally.  I've also read that Penn finds acting to be very exhausting, painful work because it takes everything out of him.

His performance in this film is hugely affecting, very credible. Dakota Fanning (where on earth did they find this heavenly child?) is simply wonderful--achingly beautiful and scarily talented for such a young child.

She fails absolutely to inhabit the character of the driven lawyer who only takes on Sam's case in order to score points with her co-workers. For a woman as outrageously beautiful as Pfeiffer to deliver a (supposedly) gut-wrenching speech on her many flaws, she'd have had to bring a lot more to the table than she does. It's just not possible to buy her in this part (which is a pity, given her many other, wonderful performances--especially in The Fabulous Baker Boys). That said, Penn and the supporting cast carry this picture with such a depth of commitment that it's possible to ignore the fact that Pfeiffer is outperformed right off the screen. Yes, it's sentimental; yes, it's been done before. But not by Penn, who never fails to bring his all to each role he takes on.

701577,AP0DQSDFSLP4P,B000066HAS,"Christopher M. MacNeil ""Chris M""","[1, 4]","As a mentally challenged man with the intellectual capability of a 7-year-old, Sean Penn - quite possibly the best working actor today - earned his third Oscar nomination in this sentimental but powerful film. Sam works as a table clearer at a Starbucks' coffee shop and is also father to a 7-year-old girl he had with a homeless woman. The two apparently get along fine until a series of haphazard dynamics collide to find Sam's daughter as a ward of the state. In his bid to reclaim his child, Sam turns to attorney Michelle Pfeiffer, a fast-moving lady who's compromised her sense of humanity in favor of professional fulfillment. Her belief that she needs only her profession for self-fulfillment is dangerously imperiled by Sam's humanity, innocent as it is from the perspective of a 7-year-old.

Sean Penn might be mentally challenged (he has the IQ of a 7 year old) but when it comes to emotional intelligence he has so much to give to his daughter and to everyone around him. What a stark contrast this is to his super intelligent lawyer who is emotionally cut off from everybody around her. The moment when he holds his newly born daughter in his arms and the whole world is turning it depicts so well the joy that he feels, a joy that all parents have felt (for some it seems that the world stops). He is an example to follow when you see him spending time with his daughter, reading books with her, singing, just been there for her. How many ""normal"" parents forget to do this very thing...Sean Penn gives an astonishing performance. Some of the moves he makes, the way he walks and some facial expressions he employs, they make you forget that he is acting (I think the fact that his eyes are relatively small compared with the rest of his face helps). Before shooting the movie he spent time with some people with special abilities and this seems to pay off during the movie.The soundtrack is superb. Beatles' classic songs are rendered in a fresh way from various artists. Just listening to ""Across the universe"" performed by Rufus Wainwright is a good enough reason to buy the cd. Choosing Beatles song is not a mere coinsidence since this group seems to be the favourite of people with special mental abilities.I would highly recommend this movie.

701581,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,B000066HAS,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[0, 0]","Not to far back I made a statement that I felt Sean Penn's performance in this film made him appear desperate.  After watching this film yet again I have to reconsider my approach for it's less desperate and more over-enthusiastic.  Who can blame an actor whose well loved and adored by fans as well as the academy for going a little overboard when given the opportunity to chomp on some real Oscar bait.  The only problem here is that Sean goes a little too far over the top and it just gets to be too much (ONLY at times...I don't want to leave the impression that the entire film is full of overacting...it's not!)That said, `I am Sam' as a whole is one of the most moving films to come out in 2001 and it still feels warm when watching, and despite the minor over-acting I am still brought to tears every time I see Sam (Penn) interacting with his daughter Lucy (Fanning).  The story of Sam, a mentally handicapped man working at Starbucks and supporting his illegitimate daughter (born to him by a homeless woman who after the delivery split from the scene leaving Sam to fend for himself), is as touching and moving as it is inspiring, and to an extent maybe the overacting on Penn's part adds to the emotional response we give when overlooking his predicament.After the state seizes his daughter claiming him unfit to care for her he convinces high profile lawyer Rita Harrison (Michelle Pfeiffer) to represent him.  As she builds her case she finds it difficult to win only because she can't seem to find a good character witness, although we all know the greatest witness is Lucy who undoubtingly loves her father very much.  The weight of this movie lands on the shoulders of young Dakota Fanning who I wholeheartedly believe was unjustly snubbed an Oscar nomination for her role as Lucy Diamond Dawson.  This young lady has more talent in her pinky finger than most actresses who've been in the business for years and is more controlled in her delivery than both Penn and Pfeiffer.  She is utterly and completely believable.Speaking of Little Miss Fanning, my wife and I were discussing this young up and comer and she was saying that maybe there's too much maturity in her eyes, that maybe this is all she is able to do, these mature roles.  My wife although has not seen last years `War of the Worlds' where Fanning played the perfect little girl, filled with innocent curiosity and complete immaturity.  I really feel that in the years to come this young girl will be quite the film icon.Back to the movie...I really must say that this movie touched me and moved me in ways that only these types of films can.  What can I say, I'm such a stickler for sad movies about people rising up against the odds (I tell you, `I am Sam', `Of Mice and Men' and `Awakenings', all dealing with the mentally handicapped, are the three main films that bring me to tears EVERYTIME).  I'd recommend this movie to anyone with the opportunity to see it, and while I have made mention to my feelings that Penn overacted a little too much, it really doesn't tear away from the message this movie carries nor the emotional weight you will feel by the time the credits begin to roll.",4,A really good choice...,1158278400,"09 15, 2006",2006,3173,"['Not', 'far', 'back', 'made', 'statement', 'felt', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'performance', 'film', 'made', 'appear', 'desperate', 'watching', 'film', 'yet', 'again', 'have', 'reconsider', 'approach', 'less', 'desperate', 'more', 'over-enthusiastic', 'Who', 'can', 'blame', 'actor', 'well', 'loved', 'adored', 'fans', 'as', 'well', 'academy', 'going', 'little', 'overboard', 'when', 'given', 'opportunity', 'chomp', 'real', 'Oscar', 'bait', 'only', 'problem', 'here', 'Sean', 'little', 'too', 'far', 'top', 'just', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'ONLY', 'times', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'leave', 'impression', 'entire', 'film', 'full', 'overacting', 'not', 'said', 'am', 'Sam', 'whole', 'one', 'most', 'moving', 'films', 'come', 'out', '2001', 'still', 'warm', 'when', 'watching', 'minor', 'over-acting', 'am', 'still', 'brought', 'tears', 'time', 'see', 'Sam', 'Penn', 'interacting', 'daughter', 'Lucy', 'Fanning', 'story', 'Sam', 'mentally', 'handicapped', 'man', 'working', 'Starbucks', 'supporting', 'illegitimate', 'daughter', 'born', 'homeless', 'woman', 'who', 'delivery', 'split', 'scene', 'leaving', 'Sam', 'fend', 'touching', 'moving', 'inspiring', 'extent', 'maybe', 'overacting', 'Penn', 'part', 'emotional', 'response', 'give', 'when', 'overlooking', 'predicament.After', 'state', 'daughter', 'claiming', 'unfit', 'care', 'high', 'lawyer', 'Rita', 'Harrison', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'represent', 'case', 'difficult', 'win', 'only', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'find', 'good', 'character', 'witness', 'know', 'greatest', 'witness', 'Lucy', 'who', 'undoubtingly', 'father', 'very', 'much', 'weight', 'movie', 'shoulders', 'young', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'who', 'wholeheartedly', 'believe', 'was', 'unjustly', 'snubbed', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'role', 'Lucy', 'Diamond', 'Dawson', 'young', 'lady', 'more', 'talent', 'pinky', 'finger', 'most', 'actresses', 'who', ""'ve"", 'been', 'business', 'years', 'more', 'controlled', 'delivery', 'Penn', 'Pfeiffer', 'utterly', 'completely', 'believable.Speaking', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Fanning', 'wife', 'were', 'discussing', 'young', 'up', 'comer', 'was', 'saying', 'maybe', 'too', 'much', 'maturity', 'eyes', 'maybe', 'able', 'do', 'mature', 'roles', 'wife', 'not', 'seen', 'last', 'years', 'War', 'Worlds', 'where', 'Fanning', 'played', 'perfect', 'little', 'girl', 'filled', 'innocent', 'curiosity', 'complete', 'immaturity', 'really', 'feel', 'years', 'come', 'young', 'girl', 'will', 'be', 'quite', 'film', 'icon.Back', 'movie', 'really', 'must', 'say', 'movie', 'touched', 'moved', 'ways', 'only', 'types', 'films', 'can', 'What', 'can', 'say', ""'m"", 'such', 'stickler', 'sad', 'movies', 'people', 'rising', 'up', 'odds', 'tell', 'am', 'Sam', 'Mice', 'Men', 'Awakenings', 'dealing', 'mentally', 'handicapped', 'are', 'three', 'main', 'films', 'bring', 'tears', 'EVERYTIME', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'opportunity', 'see', 'have', 'made', 'mention', 'feelings', 'Penn', 'overacted', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'really', ""n't"", 'tear', 'away', 'message', 'movie', 'emotional', 'weight', 'will', 'feel', 'time', 'credits', 'begin', 'roll']",I am Sam

There are, though, very realistic concerns that he may be unable to handle the responsibility.  Sam's IQ is that of a seven year old and Lucy will be eight on her next birthday.  Lucy is obviously very bright, but already fears to intellectuallyoutgrow her father.  Therefore, the state authorities think they must act quickly.Rita (Michelle Pfeiffer) is a yuppie attorney who decides to waive her normal fees.  She initially is not sure what is the right thing to do.  Should Rita merely perform her normal function as the adversarial representative of her client?  Is she possibly allowing herself to be drawn too deeply into their troubles?  After all, Rita is not exactly doing well with her own son and adulterous husband.  We view the social workers interviewing the family to evaluate both its strengths and weaknesses.  The court room exchanges are riveting. Richard Schiff splendidly portrays Turner, the State attorney with the obligation to solely look out for the best interest of the child.  Turner is not a cruel man, but seriously doubts Sam's ability to adequately care for Lucy.  He is compelled to ask the tough questions that cannot be avoided in such circumstances.  Matters later get more complicated as Randy (Laura Dern) becomes Lucy's court appointed foster mother.  Will she eventually take over full custody?  Is there some way that Rita can persuade the court of Sam's minimal competence?Does it seem that Director Jessie Nelson is pandering to our emotions?  The answer is in the affirmative.  I also thought that the story line was confusing at times. Nonetheless, there's enough meat here to justify seeing this film.  ""I am Sam"" is not a five star production, but it earns a strong four.

Sam works at Starbucks and is the father of 7-year-old Lucy [Dakota Fanning], who lives with him. When the state believes that Lucy should be put in foster care because he isn't intelligent enough to raise her, Sam fights relentlessly to get his daughter back and he gets Rita Harrison [Michelle Pfeiffer] to be his lawyer. Rita is a top-notch attorney, who is distant from her family life, greedy and somewhat self-absorbed. Despite that, she comes off as a likeable character.I'm not a law expert, so I wouldn't know if a mentally challenged man like Sam Dawson would legally be able to take custody of his child, but the law is not the issue. The issue is, does Sam deserve to take custody of Lucy? As I watched those touching scenes between Sam and Lucy, I couldn't help but feel, &quot;Yes! He should be able to keep her.&quot;Dakota Fanning was fantastic in her role. She's a great actress, for being so young. Sean Penn was incredible. He was nominated for an Oscar for his portrayal of Sam, but lost to Denzel Washington. I believe Sean gave a much more worthwhile and emotional performance and should have won.

I went into this film thinking, &quot;oh great, more vanity project Oscar-bait!&quot; and wound up getting all teary within minutes.  Sean Penn is great in the role, simply great.  I've never been that into him before seeing this film, but I gotta say that this was one of the best performances I've ever seen any actor give, in any medium.  This film itself is a shamelessly manipulative tear-jerker, in the grand Hollywood tradition, but more effective than most because the story is so terrifyingly plausible and agonizing to watch.  It's especially hard to watch Sam make mistakes that, on the outside, seem painfully obvious, but within the logic of his world are all but inevitable.  Granted, some of the plot points are a bit hackneyed, but, hey, this is a Hollywood film.  What do you expect?

701590,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B000066HAS,D. Litton,"[6, 12]","""All you need is love."" - John LennonThis famous quote serves as the focal point for the plot of ""I Am Sam,"" one of the most manipulative tear-jerkers to come out of Hollywood in quite some time. The movie does everything it can to convince its audience that it's mentally handicapped protagonist is perfectly capable of taking care of his 7-year-old daughter because he loves her; of course, common sense says otherwise.Take Sam's daily events and lifestyle, for example. He works at a Starbucks Coffee establishment, where he makes eight dollars an hour serving beverages and arranging the table packets of sugar in order (strange, isn't it, that everyone in movies can afford nice apartments at crap jobs). The mother of his new daughter, Lucy, is a homeless woman who ""only wanted a place to sleep."" During Lucy's infant years, Sam must ask for advice countless times from his neighbor, who has her own doubts about his ability as a parent.The movie, of course, uses Sam's retardation as an excuse to apply its morals of love winning over all obstacles. When Lucy is taken away from him after his arrest for unknowingly conversing with a prostitute, he asks for the help of one of the town's top lawyers, Rita Harrison (Michelle Pfeiffer), who offers to take on the case pro bono in her attempt to prove her charitable side to her coworkers. In a series of courtroom showdowns and testimonies that squeeze all the support for Sam the story can get, we are given to accept that, as little Lucy exclaims, ""all you need is love.""But the opposing side of the courtroom (at least the side we're led to believe as the opposition), makes the better argument. They call into question Sam's ability to care for Lucy in her formative years, as she makes the transition to adulthood, while Rita and Sam spend their spare time concocting speeches about what a loving father he is, and how he can give his daughter the love that no one else can. Even still, this is countered with the question ""If you really love your daughter as you say you do, then don't you believe that she deserves more?"" I'm sorry to say that I agree.As the movie plods on along its merry way, things go from saccharine to sickeningly sweet. It introduces more characters into the story, ... But the movie, as well as Sam, can't seem to come to grips with the reality of its situation, resorting to treacle and sentiment as a fallback.",2,Sickeningly sweet.,1014336000,"02 22, 2002",2002,2400,"['need', 'love', 'John', 'LennonThis', 'famous', 'quote', 'serves', 'focal', 'point', 'plot', 'Am', 'Sam', 'one', 'most', 'manipulative', 'tear-jerkers', 'come', 'Hollywood', 'quite', 'time', 'movie', 'everything', 'can', 'convince', 'audience', 'mentally', 'handicapped', 'protagonist', 'perfectly', 'capable', 'taking', 'care', '7-year-old', 'daughter', 'course', 'common', 'sense', 'otherwise.Take', 'Sam', 'daily', 'events', 'lifestyle', 'example', 'Starbucks', 'Coffee', 'establishment', 'where', 'eight', 'dollars', 'hour', 'serving', 'beverages', 'arranging', 'table', 'packets', 'sugar', 'order', 'strange', ""n't"", 'everyone', 'movies', 'can', 'afford', 'nice', 'apartments', 'crap', 'jobs', 'mother', 'new', 'daughter', 'Lucy', 'homeless', 'woman', 'who', 'only', 'wanted', 'place', 'sleep', 'Lucy', 'infant', 'years', 'Sam', 'must', 'ask', 'advice', 'countless', 'times', 'neighbor', 'who', 'own', 'doubts', 'ability', 'parent.The', 'movie', 'course', 'Sam', 'retardation', 'excuse', 'apply', 'morals', 'love', 'winning', 'obstacles', 'When', 'Lucy', 'taken', 'away', 'arrest', 'unknowingly', 'conversing', 'prostitute', 'help', 'one', 'town', 'top', 'lawyers', 'Rita', 'Harrison', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'who', 'take', 'case', 'pro', 'bono', 'attempt', 'prove', 'charitable', 'side', 'coworkers', 'series', 'courtroom', 'showdowns', 'testimonies', 'squeeze', 'support', 'Sam', 'story', 'can', 'get', 'are', 'given', 'accept', 'that', 'little', 'Lucy', 'need', 'love', 'opposing', 'side', 'courtroom', 'least', 'side', ""'re"", 'led', 'believe', 'opposition', 'better', 'argument', 'call', 'question', 'Sam', 'ability', 'care', 'Lucy', 'formative', 'years', 'transition', 'adulthood', 'Rita', 'Sam', 'spend', 'spare', 'time', 'concocting', 'speeches', 'what', 'loving', 'father', 'how', 'can', 'give', 'daughter', 'love', 'one', 'else', 'can', 'Even', 'still', 'countered', 'question', 'really', 'love', 'daughter', 'say', 'do', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'more', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'say', 'agree.As', 'movie', 'plods', 'merry', 'way', 'things', 'go', 'saccharine', 'sickeningly', 'sweet', 'more', 'characters', 'story', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'Sam', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'come', 'grips', 'reality', 'situation', 'resorting', 'treacle', 'sentiment', 'fallback']",I am Sam

701595,A1X9OJN30EBE3M,B000066HAS,Dr. Karl O. Edwards,"[2, 2]","THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE ""I am Sam"" (New Line Platinum Series) DVD (2002)In looking at the other reviews for this film I was struck by two things: the amazing polarity of reviews; and the negativity of both those reading the reviews and many of those writing reviews.  Hence, I decided to rent the film first; but ordered it within minutes of watching it and was tempted to contact the reviewer that said, ""I guarantee you will end up not buying it, or asking for your rental fee back.""  For me, ""I Am Sam"" is entertainment (albeit not drama that many may have hoped for) at its very best.At the outset I would like to make it clear that I think that Dakota Fanning, who plays Lucy, deserved a best supporting actress award.  Those who find her performance ""too good to be true"" need to watch the extras to learn more about her abilities and the experiences of her aunt that she brought to the role.  I will not enter the fray of Sean Penn's performance as Sam, beyond saying that I was able to get past the fact that it was Sean Penn; while Penn has had some good roles, I am no fan.  Michelle Pfeiffer is delightful, while Richard Schiff as the prosecutor--Mr. Turner--and Laura Dern as the foster mother--Randy Carpenter--provide depth to the usually ""villainous"" characterizations.  Are some lines and scenes over the top at times?  Yes; but they should be distracting only to those who are not truly watching the film.  Is ""I Am Sam"" realistic?  Yes and no.  But the film is a story based upon research, not a documentary; more importantly, it is believable--especially if you have spent any amount of time with disabled persons (as I have).""I Am Sam"" is a marvelous film with, in my opinion, an illusive, subjective, almost quixotic imagery that entertains through multiple movie techniques.  Moreover--at the risk of ""asking"" for negative votes--I think the movie scares many viewers because it brings them into a world they feel uncomfortable viewing: to the point of focusing on conceived stereotypes and ""wanton"" product placement.  Conversely, I do feel that the subtitle--""All You Need Is Love""--injects an unfortunate theme that leads many to ""agree"" with Roger Ebert: ""The lesson ""I Am Sam"" wants to teach us is, ""All you need is love."" This is not quite strictly true. Sam loves his daughter more than anyone else, and she loves him, but it will take more than love for him to see her through grade school and adolescence and out into the world. Since the movie does not believe this, it has a serious disagreement with most of the audience.""I would ardently argue that this is not the ""lesson""--or theme--of ""I Am Sam.""  For me, if there is a lesson (which I do not really believe there is one), it is that the line between normal and not normal is more illusive than we would like it to be.  More importantly, for me, is that the film really dares to deal with real life situations (parenting in particular), but in a cinematic fashion.  I am normally one that ""jumps"" on stereotypic, black and white, simplistic and politically correct portrayals.  Ironically, I find myself defending this approach as appropriately supportive of the photographic shooting style, editing, sound track, and musical score.  The movie is extremely well edited, that puts the viewer into the subjective perspectives of the characters.  And while some have complained that the movie uses non-Beatles versions of their songs, for which I empathize, the cost of using the actual songs would have doubled the costs.  Indeed, look at how many DVDs resort to replacing original songs used in the original showing with other versions (e.g., ""Northern Exposure"").As for all the other films that other reviewers compare ""I Am Sam"" with, I must say that I do not feel that one can justifiably do so.  I truly feel that ""I Am Sam"" is a unique film, presented in a fairly unique fashion.  Perhaps it is the uniqueness that causes the polarization--a need to categorize ""I Am Sam"" into a ""type.""  But this is not ""Rain Man,"" or any other movie.  ""I Am Sam"" is its own movie: it questions the viability of a ""disabled"" (mentally challenged or not) person to be a parent--and just what is parenting?  The film is about being different, each person in their own way.  Is love important?  Yes, but not the solution; rather it is glue that binds people together.  And so, ""I Am Sam"" is also about friends and their important roles in our daily lives.If you are looking for an upbeat or different film, I highly recommend that you venture along with ""I Am Sam"" for 134 minutes.  Some of you may cry or otherwise empathize.  I did not: I found myself feeling like a fly on the wall--a part of the film itself.  If you are looking for action, drama, or the ordinary I suggest you might look elsewhere.Please Note: If this review was not helpful to you, I would appreciate learning the reason(s) so I can improve my reviews. My goal is to provide help to potential buyers, not get into any arguments. So, if you only disagree with my opinion, could you please say so in the comments and not indicate that the review was not helpful.

701598,A3TIJC6L8USJ6Q,B000066HAS,Elderbear,"[2, 5]","I gave this film three stars because I found it somewhat entertaining, and thought it raised some provocative issues. Much of the poignancy of the story is diluted, however, by a number of failures. Had these been attended to, this movie could have realized its five star potential.Sean Penn does a mediocre imitation of Dustin Hoffman's ""Rainman"" character ... and with the frequent references to Kramer Versus Kramer throughout the movie, this is incredibly distracting. The character of ""Benny"" on the old LA Law TV show demonstrated a much more convincing portrayal of somebody mentally challenged.Speaking of Kramer Versus Kramer, the final resolution is lifted almost directly from that movie--quite a disappointment. Michelle Pfeifer's character, as Penn's attorney, feels like a caricature, rather than a believable person. Oddly enough, her transformation, a sideshow to the main story line, demonstrates the most character growth of any of the major players ... and reflects Dustin Hoffman's transformation in Kramer Versus Kramer.This movie does demonstrate, however, the capricious nature of our social service system. We expect social workers to make good decisions about child welfare while we fail to provide budgets for adequate staffing. In this movie, that isn't made clear, all we see are social workers and therapists reacting to Sam out of prejudice.

Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[8, 13]","Films that depict the life struggles of persons with mental or physical disabilities almost automatically tug on the heartstrings of any sensitive viewer.  I AM SAM does no less, and it does so with the masterful talents of Sean Penn and Michelle Pfieffer and an amazingly talented little girl named Dakota Fanning (she has deep, incandescent blue eyes that evoke a talent far beyond her years).Sean Penn stars as Sam, a mentally-challenged Starbucks clerk who excitedly clings to the role of father when the homeless woman he gets pregnant skips out on him.  Somehow (the movie never tells), he manages to display the skills to bring Lucy up to seven years old (when the narrative of the film swings into full play).The incredibly lovely Michelle Pfieffer does an admirable job pouring life into a vastly underwritten role.  As a jetset lawyer, she's torn between her job, her role as a wife, and her role as a mother ... all of which she, arguably, is failing at.  However, Ms. Pfeiffer manages to give her character, Rita Harrison, a sense of reality and a sense of history that lifts an otherwise secondary role into a more interesting person, one that the viewer wants to get to know.  Sadly, the scenes of development with her husband and her son were either never written, never filmed, or left on the cutting room floor.Dakota Fanning, as Lucy, is simply marvelous.  A true talent in the making, she manages to steal every scene she's in without a touch of mirth to her performance.Laura Dern pops up in the obligatory cameo-sized role, and, when her mother-wannabe sentiments forces her to face the bittersweet reality of choosing between breaks, the viewer feels her pain.All in all, I AM SAM is not a great picture, as it feels more like a big budget Lifetime or perhaps HBO-cable movie, but it's passable entertainment with some acting heavyweights showing their stuff.",3,"Talent In Top Form, Or Exploitation Of The Heart?",1013385600,"02 11, 2002",2002,1881,"['Films', 'depict', 'life', 'struggles', 'persons', 'mental', 'physical', 'disabilities', 'almost', 'automatically', 'tug', 'heartstrings', 'sensitive', 'viewer', 'AM', 'SAM', 'less', 'so', 'masterful', 'talents', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Michelle', 'Pfieffer', 'amazingly', 'talented', 'little', 'girl', 'named', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'deep', 'incandescent', 'blue', 'eyes', 'evoke', 'talent', 'far', 'years', '.Sean', 'Penn', 'stars', 'Sam', 'mentally-challenged', 'Starbucks', 'clerk', 'who', 'excitedly', 'clings', 'role', 'father', 'when', 'homeless', 'woman', 'pregnant', 'skips', 'out', 'Somehow', 'movie', 'never', 'display', 'skills', 'bring', 'Lucy', 'up', 'seven', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'narrative', 'film', 'swings', 'full', 'play', 'incredibly', 'lovely', 'Michelle', 'Pfieffer', 'admirable', 'job', 'pouring', 'life', 'vastly', 'underwritten', 'role', 'jetset', 'lawyer', 'torn', 'job', 'role', 'wife', 'role', 'mother', 'arguably', 'failing', 'However', 'Ms.', 'Pfeiffer', 'give', 'character', 'Rita', 'Harrison', 'sense', 'reality', 'sense', 'history', 'otherwise', 'secondary', 'role', 'more', 'interesting', 'person', 'one', 'viewer', 'get', 'know', 'Sadly', 'scenes', 'development', 'husband', 'son', 'were', 'either', 'never', 'written', 'never', 'filmed', 'left', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor.Dakota', 'Fanning', 'Lucy', 'simply', 'marvelous', 'true', 'talent', 'making', 'steal', 'scene', 'touch', 'mirth', 'performance.Laura', 'Dern', 'up', 'obligatory', 'cameo-sized', 'role', 'when', 'mother-wannabe', 'sentiments', 'face', 'bittersweet', 'reality', 'choosing', 'breaks', 'viewer', 'pain.All', 'AM', 'SAM', 'not', 'great', 'picture', 'more', 'big', 'budget', 'Lifetime', 'perhaps', 'HBO-cable', 'movie', 'passable', 'entertainment', 'acting', 'heavyweights', 'showing', 'stuff']",I am Sam

In all of its overflowing emotion, there is a true feeling of truth and humanity that grabbed me as a viewer. Most importantly, Penn did an amazing job making Sam into a convincing and human character, very seldom over-the-top.From all the other reviews you know the premise of the movie--the mentally handicapped man with the heart fo gold trying to keep his family intact--so I won't regurgitate that. Sure, this film utilizes some stereotypes, not to even mention the dazzling array of less-than-subtle product placements...but it pulls the whole thing off with a certain sense of real human value. Dakota Fanning as the young daughter never falls victim to crappy-child-actor syndrome; she's sweet and believable in a totally un-cloying sort of way. Overall, the film is a grand story of a non-traditional family fighting to stay together on an endearingly small-scale. Come on, this movie actually made me cry, a lot...and if you can suck it up and allow yourself to enjoy that sort of thing, it can actually be a powerful viewing-experience. I highly recommend this film for a night when you are willing to let yourself get caught up in a sweet story with some outstanding acting and quirky little twists.

701601,A1655SGPPUUCRP,B000066HAS,Emily Todd,"[0, 0]","""I Am Sam"" is one of my favorite films of 2001, despite what the critics have been saying. I really don't see how you could truly dislike this film. It's touching, meaningful, insightful, inspiring and boasts one of the best performances if the year by Sean Penn. I left the theater feeling rejuvenated and refreshed. ""I Am Sam"" also had the power to make me reexamine my own life and made me rethink some of my decisions. I learned a lot from ""I Am Sam"", it touched me in a way that not many movies do.Mental retardation is a tough subject to work. It has often been glamorized or used in cheap ways to add emotion to a story. Director Jessie Nelson handles it beautifully, which makes ""I Am Sam"" a painfully honest and moving film. Mental retardation has never been properly represented, therefore giving many people a slanted view of it. This film changes it all! I went into ""I Am Sam"" expecting a ""sap fest"", if you may, but was pleasantly surprised not to see this.Simply put, I was blown away by Sean Penn! How often can a Hollywood bad boy pull off a role as a mentally retarded father? Penn didn't just ""pull off"" his role as Sam, he mastered it in the most convincing and heartfelt portrayal of mental retardation to date. Michelle Pfeiffer was wonderful as usual and I also enjoyed seeing Laura Dern again in a small role as Lucy's foster parents.

This film makes us care about Sam, a mentally-challenged man who takes care of his 7-year old daughter, Lucy. An abrupt separation might take place as social services try to persuade Sam that he cannot properly take care of his own daughter. That's the basic storyline. What follows are some truly believable performances from Sean Penn, Michelle Pheiffer, Dakota Fanning, and Richard Schiff. Penn seems to have the mental capacities of a 7-year old down perfectly; this has to be one of his finest performances. Pheiffer is also splendid as the lawyer who cooperates with Sam on the custody of Lucy. To tell you the truth, I didn't really mind Fanning as Lucy. She may be one of the most overrated child stars of all time, but here, she gives a wonderful performance as the young girl who never wants to hurt her dad's feelings. Schiff absolutely looks hateful in his role; you just want to punch him in the face for hours.Again, this movie does look as if it desperately wants us to see how powerful this movie really is.

The subtle and thought provoking script bolsters these feelings with its deliberate progression delivering a cohesive story line that a fixated audience can follow. The well-constructed parallels between Penn and his attorney Michelle Pfeiffer are credibility told with equal subtlety. An impressive and surprising role was that of Laura Dern's who seems destined to give the audience the conventional performance of the pseudo holier-than-thou protective foster parent but comes to learn more about the motivations of Penn than does Pfeiffer. That part of the film was delicately played for an emotional impact and it certainly delivers one. Sean Penn deserves some credible recognition for his performance in this film that has been long overdue. He should have been given credible consideration for the Academy Award.

The acting by the main protagonists, but especially of Mr. Penn was flawless.

So, if you experience the lack of sound from the surround speakers and subwoofer, don't go crazy trying (like me)to find the problem. Your receiver should warn you of the Low Frequency Effect. This is a minor problem since the movie doesn't require the sound effect that action packed movies requiere.

701622,AJA7284SMHE0T,B000066HAS,"Infinite Catalyst ""C. Robert Dennis""","[35, 37]","This film is phenomenal.  Let me tell you why, in the best way I know how:**Personal Preface:  My brother Christopher has autism.  He was diagnosed with autism when he was four, and is now twenty-four.  In age, he is my older brother; in mentality I have been his older brother since I was 5.Growing up with Christopher has taught me many things about life-perspective and how some people see many things differently.  I am deeply saddened by the other reviews here slandering the film on the grounds that ""it takes much more than love to get a girl through adolescence, and anything else in life.""The Greeks labeled three kinds of love, Eros: passionate or sensual love, Phileao: love shared between close friends and family, and Agape: A transcendent, selfless love that neither wavers nor grows dim.  Unfortunately some people have never experienced all three of these types of love, nor do they know how to measure their efficacy.To my brother Christopher, all he does need is love, and literally as a high functioning person with autism, all he gives is love.  It's all he knows.  He loves life, cheeseburgers, music, church: simple things.As a certified assistant psychotherapist for the Lovaas firm of autism research, I also know that love, even as the popular definition as our culture knows it, is the most effective tool in helping both children and those with autism develop as functional human beings.My mother works with the career resource exchange in Colorado Springs.  In her case load has more than 30 different people with mental disabilities that she helps on a bi-weekly basis.  Even having an autistic child, she did not recognize Sean Penn until the movie was over.  Here's the kicker, Sean Penn is her favorite actor.  That is what kind of performance he gives.To both Roger Ebert, and the individual that quoted him: Ebert, everyone knew you as the bitter weird tub next to Siskel, grow up, and figure out that nobody like your pious pretension and aesthetic retardation.  In response to the pessimistic young man who quoted R.E. Mystery Log: befriend someone with downs, or Aspurgers, and figure out how their minds work, how their hearts talk, and then critique movies that you know nothing about.***Movie Review:  Honestly Sean Penn's performance eclipses Dustin Hoffman's in Rain man, both for believability and accuracy.  You know how the Academy Awards operate; he was being rewarded for this performance this year.  Sean Penn's performance is nothing short of a cinematic miracle of epic proportions.  His behaviorisms, tics, antics, voice inflection, deliveries, the list just goes on and on.Two of the four actors that played his friends actually had the disabilities they were portraying, making authenticity something not to be questioned.The film raises a series on controversial questions about guardianship and family; the most controversial here being how certain demanding vocations can corrode your life, and your relationship with your family.  Michelle Pfeifer does an incredible job portraying the overworked mother, whose stresses at a six figure job causes dilapidations in her home life as well as work relations.The other amount of controversy can be attributed to the antagonizing of the state's District Attorney.  In most cases the state does do its job of properly assessing the abilities of caretakers of those mentally disabled, but there have been many cases where the state was incapable of demonstrating these abilities.  By no means does this movie mean to prove that this is unequivocally the lot of the courthouse, but it does illuminate infractions that are not unheard of in the courtroom.This film has made me cry every time I see it.  I have seen it about eight times.

Now, with the help of an eccentric lawyer, he is fighting to regain the custody of his child or risk losing her forever.As you undoubtedly have read, Sean Penn gave a brilliant performance here, I'm not sure whether it's Oscar calibur or not, but he definitely gave it his best.  Penn's portrayal of Sam was sweet and heartbreaking at the same time, without being overbearing or excessive, and that made the whole experience all the more believable.  Michelle Pfeiffer also did a decent job as the obsessive compulsive lawyer Rita, a troubled mother and a frustrated wife, her own life is falling apart as she attempts to help Sam to rebuild his.Unfortunately, the other aspects of the movie doesn't work as well.  The premise is a good one, but the film is overly manipulative and sentimental as it plays with the audiences' emotions.  Furthermore, the film is about half an hour too long, many scenes seem to drag on endlessly without purpose.  As a whole, I Am Sam just doesn't have the polish and effectiveness it strive to achieve.

701628,A3HB5BTD9VHDS8,B000066HAS,"""jbridell""","[8, 15]","I understand the need to check ones sensible side at the door when going to some films, I don't expect everything to be realistic, that would be boring, why go to the movies if your going to see real life?  If you are reading this then you know the premise; A retarded (mentally challenged) man fights to keep custody of his adorable daughter, short of sending men with hammers into the theater to smash people's fingers, I can't think of a more obvious tearjerker, so what's wrong with that?  Nothing really, but my problems with this film are that it totally assumes the audience either A.  Knows absolutely nothing about the mentally challenged and how they are treated, at work etc.  B.  Won't care because the performances are so darned good, which they are.  I'm no expert but I used to drive people to and from there jobs who were much like Penns character, and this film as a far far cry from any semblance of reality.  Sam has the mental capacity of a 7 year old, a randy 7 year old we can guess since he fathered a child, this is a problem because we cannot see he has any interest in sex, even the ever gorgeous Michelle Phiefer can't get his attention, sexually.  We are also expected to believe that this man with a heart of gold forced or at least consented to having sex with this homeless women because ""she needed a place to stay"" sadly I am sure this happens all too often, but not this character, Sam would not have wanted to, or forced himself on this women sexually, it just wouldn't happen.  The hospital sends him home with this baby based on the fact that he answered ""yes"" when a nurse says ""are you responsible for this""? Good enough heres your baby, now go, like he was picking up a happy meal.  This is all to set up a scene where he spins around in the street with said baby while Beatles music plays, I love the Beatles and I enjoyed most of the covers (they did not use the originals, I'm sure for financial reasons).  A little of this is OK, but the suspension of disbelief here rivals Dumbo, honestly I would sooner believe an elephant flies then this man who barely makes minimum wage can support himself, provide daycare, Diane Wiest (who seems to be reprising her Jane Grearson role from Little man Tate, a much better film) provides care when the baby is too big to take to work at Starbucks, no I'm not kidding. There are all manor of silly, impossible things, example, he shops for diapers, diapers are expensive, did he just leave the baby at home? But it was funny to watch him fumble with the diapers.  While in foster care Lucy, named for Lucy in the sky with Diamonds, repeatedly leaves the house and wonders with her adorable stuffed animal to the perfect song ""Blackbird,"" wouldn't someone have locked the door or window after the first time? yes of course, but then we wouldn't have the cute jump cuts of sweet Lucy being carried back and forth in front of the 711. But, just like Dumbo, one could have brought a mop and bucket to this film, the tears have not flowed like that since Mrs. Jumbo was paroled, mad elephant indeed! One would have to be made of stone to not be moved by Penns spot on performance and the little girl was as good an actress as has ever been she had the thankless task of delivering lines like ""Your not like other daddies...they don't take there kids to the park"" without making anyone in the audience vomit, not one person hurled.  Everyone else was perfect too, the group of his friends rivaled ""Cookoo's Nest"" and we never saw too many silly courtroom scenes, and there were very few cut out bad guy characters, the unfeeling social worker, the evil family wanting to adopt etc. this script took chances with everything except a semi believable plot.  I was moved, but angered as well, with all the effort this film made, couldn't someone have written something halfway believable?

701632,A3MQ672FYFNM7B,B000066HAS,JGC,"[2, 3]","Normally I would not sit through a movie this lousy with such a pathetic script and story but since it has one of my very favorite movie actors in it, Sean Penn, I figured I owed it to at least watch it. ""I am Sam"" is just such a cliche of every single sappy, sad and otherwise melodramatically bad film that I've ever seen. It has the loving young girl in need of her father, the proverbial David and Goliath story that everyone has seen about a zillion times and that elusive man-child that believes that love conquers all. Who the hell writes these scripts and how they got Sean Penn (one of the greatest actors of my generation) to sign up for this overstuffed turkey will behoove the imagination. Sean does go out of his way to play the part to the hilt. He gives a good performance of Sam. But I don't think it's fair to blame him for the sub-par movie. Where were the writers and producers and the director? The story was so incredibly unrealistic that I sincerely doubt that even in a hundred years would the events in this movie ever take place anywhere in our universe. Because let's examine the story. Here's a man who does not have any basic skills to take care of himself and who has the capacity of a young child, yet he is now thrown into the realm of parenting his own child. And don't get me wrong, Sam was no worse and no better than any other parent. But does this happen in real life? As well all know, no, it doesn't. Where was Sam's family? Why didn't he have any support system to speak up? His daughter was born and the birth-mother literally ran away before they got home from the hospital. Then the scene picks up years later when Lucy was 7 or 8. How did Sam parent the child for the first several years of her life? It wasn't explained because it wasn't plausible. And what was up with that hideous music. John Lennon (may he rest in peace) would be turning in his grave to hear his classic music butchered like this. Michelle Pfeiffer was so annoying, not just because she was competely covered and caked in makeup that made her look like a walking Bamberger's cosmetics counter, but also because she was the typical movie cliche. Lawyers do not take cases ""pro bono"" as the movie called it unless they think they can get a piece of the action.

701636,AVMYCMAOY4F4S,B000066HAS,Joan C. Frank,"[0, 1]","If I could give this movie a 4.5 star rating, I would.This film has huge strengths in several areas.  First, the acting is stellar.  Sean Penn has received incredible accolades recently, and they are all deserved.  Next, the plot is not sensationalized.  It is steady and believable, and is not pushed ""over the top"" by the introduction of extreme plot twists.  (For example, the little girl could have ended up in an abusive foster home....)  My favorite strength is the way that the movie portrays the life of mentally challenged adults.  Sean Penn and his buddies have carved out a life that is productive and fun for them.  Finally, I like the positive resolution reached at the end that acknowledges that good, competent parents come in many forms.There are a few aspects of the film that are not so wonderful.  First it is about a half and hour too long.  The 3rd quarter of the story drags through the court hearings.  Additionally, Michelle Pfeiffer's character did not always seem probable or even possible.

701637,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B000066HAS,Joe Sherry,"[1, 5]","A Film by Jessie NelsonWe are introduced to Sam Dawson (Sean Penn) at the very start of the movie.  He is working in a Starbucks and his job is to make sure the cups are straight, that the salt/sugar packets are aligned, and to bring customers coffee.  We learn without being directly told that Sam is mentally handicapped.  Not long after this introduction, Sam is told ""it is time.""  When he realizes that it is time, he hurries and walks very fast to a hospital, in time for his daughter to be born.  Shortly after the birth as he is bringing the little girl home with the mother, the mother takes off and Sam never sees her again.  Sam does not quite know what to do, but gets help from a neighbor.  He finds a routine so that he can function and he does not deviate from it.The movie flashes forward several years so that Lucy (Dakota Fanning) is now 7 years old.  She is the sweetest little girl and initially not much is wrong.  Because of Lucy's age, Sam has a greater intellectual capacity and Lucy only notices that Sam is different.  She loves him, though, so she doesn't let it bother her.  As she gets a little bit older, she surpasses Sam intellectually and when she brings a friend home, the little boy calls asks Lucy if her father is ""retarded"".  This point begins the downward spiral that ends when Lucy is taken away from Sam by the Police and Child Services.  Sam had (unknowingly) made some mistakes that were misconstrued as being worse than they may have been.We are now introduced to lawyer Rita Harrison (Michelle Pfieffer).  Rita is initially unwilling to take the case, but agrees to work pro bono.  This point is about halfway through the movie and the rest of the movie is mostly the interaction between Rita, Sam, and Lucy (though Lucy is out of the movie for long stretches of time) and how Rita can possibly win Lucy back through court.  The movie also addresses the question of whether or not a mentally handicapped man is physically capable of raising a child, and also if he should do so.  Throughout the movie I was torn on that issue and I'm not positive that I came up with a good answer to that question.  Sam has such a strong support system in place that his deficiencies are more than made up with his friends who love Lucy like their own.I was surprised by this movie.  It was better than I expected after watching the trailer.  Sean Penn gives a fine performance as Sam and Michelle Pfieffer is believable in her role as a lawyer who is falling apart in her personal life with her family.  Everyone does a good job in their roles but the standout is little Dakota Fanning.  She is absolutely perfect.  She is so sweet, gentle and kind that you really want her life to turn out fine no matter all the troubles with her father, the court, and the foster family.  I think that it is because of Fanning that this movie succeeds.  You really start to care for Lucy and it is a credit to Dakota Fanning that any such connection is made.

701639,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B000066HAS,Joseph Haschka,"[5, 11]","An examination of the ability of a mentally handicapped adult to raise a mentally normal child seems a fair topic for a ""60 Minutes"" segment but certainly not a 133-minute film. And most definitely not as portrayed in I AM SAM.Sean Penn plays Sam Dawson, a young man with the mental capacity of a 7-year old, who waits tables at an LA Starbuck's. In the film's opening 10 minutes, Sam rushes off to attend the birth of his daughter, Lucy. The mother, an anonymous homeless woman, deserts Sam and her offspring immediately upon being released from the hospital. Dawson, who loves his child immensely, is left to cope alone. Things go as well as can be expected until the girl turns seven. At that point, it's apparent that Lucy is mentally outstripping Old Dad. After Sam is picked up on Big Brother's radar after a ridiculous incident, his ability to raise his child is called into serious question by the local child protection agency and the court system. To demonstrate to colleagues that she really does have a heart, Dawson's case is taken on pro bono by Rita, a high octane Lawyer-With-An-Attitude played by Michelle Pfeiffer.Before I rant about all that's wrong with I AM SAM, let me say that I did like Pfeiffer's character. Rita's impassioned outburst on what life is really like for her ""perfect"" self is worth the price of admission. (That I think the actress is a Major Babe and I paid nothing to see the film are irrelevant.) But, beyond that one sparkle ...Sean Penn does a superb job portraying a man with the mind of a kid. However, the range of the role is so necessarily narrow that his performance becomes monotonous by the end of the film's way too long run time. And, because Sam exhibits no sexual self-awareness or sex drive whatsoever, the fact that he impregnated Lucy's biological mother beggars belief, especially since her only line in the film is her farewell to Sam, ""I only wanted a place to sleep."" I mean, how much encouragement could she have given him to consummate The Act?Lucy is fetchingly played by the adorable young actress, Dakota Fanning. But since the whole purpose of the script is to arouse the audience to a frenzy of sympathy for the underdog Sam, one wouldn't expect to see an ugly kid.There's one totally preposterous scene where a ""John"" is busted for soliciting a prostitute without any proposition being made or money changing hands! And this in a city where the working girls advertise on the Web? Oh, please!But my biggest objection to this unabashed tearjerker is the fact that, in their overwrought desire to whip up viewer compassion for Dawson, the screenwriters totally ignored any scenario that might have given credence to the eminently reasonable position that Sam was indeed too poorly equipped to raise Lucy, and therefore spoil a pre-ordained warm and fuzzy ending. Case in point. Laura Dern plays Randy, a loving and intelligent middle-class woman perfectly suited to be Lucy's foster mother. Even though Randy is married to a man that just might - surprise, surprise! - be capable of being a warm and caring foster father, that possibility is never explored because we never even see the Phantom Hubby except for a brief 10-second shot. The script was weighted in Sam's favor from the very beginning!

Let us all pause for a while &amp; think who is really incapable here of living a happy &amp; healthy life...Sam, who is mentally inept but has earned his daughter's full trust &amp; love, or Rita (who represents all of us) who is mentally competent but couldn't decipher how to run her own life &amp; those she loves?Most of the time, we outgrow the heart &amp; mind of a child...a child who is trusting, loving, honest, willing, succumbing.

I'm only 20 years old, I have no children, and even I know it takes a lot more than love to provide for a child.

I started crying at the beginning when Sam was being kind to a certain customer during his Job at Starbucks and telling the customer that he made a good drink choice.

701654,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000066HAS,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[8, 9]","How you end up feeling about &quot;I Am Sam&quot; is going to come down to which wins out, your heart or your head, because those two parts are not going to agree.  In this 2001 film from director Jessie Nelson a mentally retarded man, Sam Dawson (Sean Penn) has to fight for custody of his bright 7-year-old daughter, Lucy Diamond Dawson (Dakota Fanning), with help from a cold-hearted lawyer, Rita Harrison (Michelle Pfeiffer).  The state of California, represented by Richard Schiff as Turner, is concerned because Lucy is now smarter than her father and needs smarter parents (this seems a dangerous precedent to me, but you know what California law is like).This film knows how to manipulate the heartstrings big time, starting when young Lucy asks her daddy why he is different from the other daddies and refuses to read any book that her father cannot read.  Then we get to the point where the System, in its infinite wisdom, takes the little girl away from her father.  When that happens we do not hear her screams, just the music turned up load, which reminded me of the extreme pathos of that same scene in Chaplin's &quot;The Kid,&quot; where not hearing Jackie Coogan scream for his dad did not matter.  Meanwhile, there is the whole bit as Sam wears down super lawyer Rita and gets her to remember that family might be as important as work.  In the beginning Rita is basically shamed into taking on Sam's case, but in the end she is emotionally involved in the case and the life of her client.  All that matters is reuniting father and daughter.But the brain keeps asking some key questions about what is happening here.  First, why did the State wait until this point to question Sam's parenting?  The concern here is never about Lucy's safety with her father, but her desire to keep learning now that she is smarter than Sam.  Second, if Lucy had been of average intelligence and not a cute little blonde kid if the State would have found her a wonderful foster home with Randy (Laura Dern) and her husband?  I am inclined to think probably not.  Third, why are the Department of Children and Family Services lawyers portrayed as villains?  Every thing Turner says is true and he repeatedly makes it clear that his intention is the welfare of the child.  He is talking practical realities and not abstract ideals.Twice in &quot;I Am Sam&quot; the film echoes the famous child custody film &quot;Kramer vs. Kramer.&quot;  The first time the moment sneaks up on the audience, as well as most of the characters, and it signals a reversal in Sam's fortunes.  In fact, the next time I am reminded of the other film it again signals a reversal in Sam's fortunes, and that was the point at which the head shoved the heart aside and rendered its final verdict on this film.  I was not all that impressed with the rabbit coming out of the hat the first time around, and even less so the second time.As for Penn's performance, I can see why he was nominated for an Academy Award given the propensity to give the Oscar to actors portraying handicapped individuals (Cliff Robertson in &quot;Charly,&quot; Hoffman in &quot;Rain Man,&quot; Geoffrey Rush in &quot;Shine&quot;).  But I have to admit that such mannered performances next strike me as being as finally nuanced as other great acting performance.  Still, he is good, and the scenes between him and Fanning sparkle.Half the film is scored to covers of Beatles songs by Sarah McLachlan, Eddie Vedder and others, which makes for an interesting soundtrack album.  Ultimately, I decided to split the difference between the ranks given by the head and the heart on this one because I did enjoy it, even as I complained bitterly about all the problems I saw in &quot;I Am Sam.&quot;  I embrace my contradictions, even in print and for public consumption.

701655,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B000066HAS,Lee Armstrong,"[1, 6]","""I Am Sam"" is a great movie, not perfect, but one I will want to revisit.  The handheld camera style that resembles NYPD Blue tries to give a realistic look to the picture, but doesn't totally work.  The scene where Sam Dawson is arrested for solicitation is totally unbelievable, given the circumstance and Penn's convincing innocence.  Unfortunately, this contrivance is the catalyst to launch the story.  However, despite these blips, the story is moving.As Penn fights for his daughter Lucy Diamond Dawson, named after the Beatles' song, how can any father not be touched?  The picture boils to down to the incredible and irreplaceable need for love which children and adults have.  Without it, we wither.  The performances are excellent.  Will somebody please give Michelle Pfeiffer a great film role so she can get her Oscar?  What a talented actress!  The levels she reaches are breathtaking.  The scene where she tells Dawson that she is not perfect and breaks down is a tour de force.  Penn is so amazing in this picture.  He has the mannerisms and is a bastian of focused concentration.  The supporting cast is also great.  Loretta (Boston Public) Divine as the evil social worker and Richard (West Wing) Schiff as the evil attorney are people we can love to hate.  Dakota Fanning as the delightful Lucy tugs at the heartstrings.  The scene where she knows she is being observed and says, ""I want to be with my daddy,"" and then turns to the observation glass and shouts, ""Did you hear that?"" is a bullet to the heart.  Laura Dern, Mary Steenburgen and Dianne Weist are also all great.  Then there's the soundtrack!  When Rufus Wainwright sings ""Across the Universe,"" I want to stop the film and run to the stereo.  The DVD deleted scenes are quite interesting.  Penn & Fanning on the bus with the repeated joke about ""Knock Knock, Orange,"" puts a smile on your face.  The deleted takes of Penn getting upset with coffee customers are also final take quality.  This film is great because it succeeds in reminding us about our humanity and that our love for our children should always of primary importance.  It reminds us of our own zest for love.

701656,A19RAJY6R7USN0,B000066HAS,"Lee Neville ""emotionboy""","[1, 4]","Sean Penn and Michelle Pfeiffer remind us that love is all you need in this touching story about life, love and laughter.&quot;I Am Sam&quot; is the story of a mentally challenged father (Sean Penn) who enlists a high profile lawyer (Michelle Pfeiffer) to help him regain custody of his daughter (played by the marvellous Dakota Fanning who would go on to appear in Steven Spielberg's &quot;TAKEN&quot;).At the beginning of the movie we are introduced to Sam and see him working at his job in Starbucks. Soon after we see a woman giving birth to a young baby. Sam names the baby Lucy, based on a Beatles song. The mother who it turns out was homeless and just needed somewhere to stay one night didn't plan on having a baby with Sam, and so runs off later, leaving a very disoriented Sam with the baby. Sam makes the decision to take his baby home. Although their are several problems initially, Sam is helped by his fellow mentally challenged friends. Lucy reaches the age of 7 and her school teachers meet Sam and express concerns. Sam's mental age is that of a 7 year old, and they are concerned about what happens when Lucy turns 8. Eventually social services become involved and Lucy is taken away from Sam. Based on advice from his friends, Sam seeks the help of a lawyer to get Lucy back.Sometimes when movies are advertised they are given a tag line. When this was released in the UK in 2002, a British newspaper described &quot;I Am Sam&quot; as the &quot;tearjerker of the year&quot;. It can often be said that people can't dictate how you feel, and so if someone tells you the film is going to be a tearjerker then it quite often won't deliver. It's like having extremely high expectations for a movie. You are quite likely to be disappointed. I'm glad I wasn't with this, and it certainly delivered.To be honest, the main reason I wanted to see this movie was because I'd seen such an inspired performance from Dakota Fanning in &quot;TAKEN&quot;, that I wanted to see more here. If I hadn't wanted to see more of Dakota then I quite possibly would have missed out on this movie. All of acting in this movie from leads and the supporting cast is just perfect for this kind of movie. The direction by director and co-writer Jessie Nelson is very thought out and the director of photography has his work cut out, especially when it comes to seeing the world the way Sam would see it. I was ready for this movie not to deliver on some of the emotion, but fortunately it did, creating a very memorable movie experience.The DVD features a Commentary by director/Co-screenwriter Jessie Nelson and it is very delicately done. Jessie Nelson is informative and has such a wonderful vocal quality. I could almost imagine her being a narrator like Dakota Fanning was on &quot;TAKEN&quot;. Jessie Nelson is very compassionate about this project as any director should be. So much so, that this is probably the first time I'd describe a DVD commentary as being beautiful.Also on the DVD is a Theatrical trailer and the Original Documentary: &quot;Becoming Sam&quot; which is a fascinating look at what it took to put the movie together, as well as Deleted and Alternate Scenes with optional director commentary. Also featured on this Region 1 US DVD version is some DVD-ROM CONTENT including Script-to-Screen, Link to Original Website and Hot Spot. The movie itself is in Widescreen anamorphic format.I met Sam, maybe you should meet him too.",5,Meet Sam!,1048723200,"03 27, 2003",2003,3441,"['Sean', 'Penn', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'remind', 'love', 'need', 'touching', 'story', 'life', 'love', 'laughter.', 'quot', 'Am', 'Sam', 'quot', 'story', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'father', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'who', 'high', 'profile', 'lawyer', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'help', 'regain', 'custody', 'daughter', 'played', 'marvellous', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'who', 'would', 'go', 'appear', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'quot', 'TAKEN', 'quot', '.At', 'beginning', 'movie', 'are', 'introduced', 'Sam', 'see', 'working', 'job', 'Starbucks', 'Soon', 'see', 'woman', 'giving', 'birth', 'young', 'baby', 'Sam', 'baby', 'Lucy', 'based', 'Beatles', 'song', 'mother', 'who', 'out', 'was', 'homeless', 'just', 'needed', 'somewhere', 'stay', 'one', 'night', 'did', ""n't"", 'plan', 'having', 'baby', 'Sam', 'so', 'runs', 'off', 'later', 'leaving', 'very', 'disoriented', 'Sam', 'baby', 'Sam', 'decision', 'take', 'baby', 'home', 'are', 'several', 'problems', 'initially', 'Sam', 'helped', 'fellow', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'friends', 'Lucy', 'age', '7', 'school', 'teachers', 'meet', 'Sam', 'express', 'concerns', 'Sam', 'mental', 'age', '7', 'year', 'old', 'are', 'concerned', 'what', 'when', 'Lucy', '8', 'Eventually', 'social', 'services', 'become', 'involved', 'Lucy', 'taken', 'away', 'Sam', 'Based', 'advice', 'friends', 'Sam', 'help', 'lawyer', 'get', 'Lucy', 'back.Sometimes', 'when', 'movies', 'are', 'advertised', 'are', 'given', 'tag', 'line', 'When', 'was', 'released', 'UK', '2002', 'British', 'newspaper', 'described', 'quot', 'Am', 'Sam', 'quot', 'quot', 'tearjerker', 'year', 'quot', 'can', 'often', 'be', 'said', 'people', 'ca', ""n't"", 'dictate', 'how', 'feel', 'so', 'someone', 'film', 'going', 'be', 'tearjerker', 'then', 'quite', 'often', 'wo', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'having', 'extremely', 'high', 'expectations', 'movie', 'are', 'quite', 'likely', 'be', 'disappointed', ""'m"", 'glad', 'was', ""n't"", 'certainly', 'be', 'honest', 'main', 'reason', 'wanted', 'see', 'movie', 'was', ""'d"", 'seen', 'inspired', 'performance', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'quot', 'TAKEN', 'quot', 'wanted', 'see', 'more', 'here', 'had', ""n't"", 'wanted', 'see', 'more', 'Dakota', 'then', 'quite', 'possibly', 'would', 'have', 'missed', 'out', 'movie', 'acting', 'movie', 'leads', 'supporting', 'cast', 'just', 'perfect', 'kind', 'movie', 'direction', 'director', 'co-writer', 'Jessie', 'Nelson', 'very', 'thought', 'out', 'director', 'photography', 'work', 'cut', 'out', 'especially', 'when', 'seeing', 'world', 'way', 'Sam', 'would', 'see', 'was', 'ready', 'movie', 'not', 'deliver', 'emotion', 'fortunately', 'did', 'creating', 'very', 'memorable', 'movie', 'experience.The', 'DVD', 'Commentary', 'director/Co-screenwriter', 'Jessie', 'Nelson', 'very', 'delicately', 'done', 'Jessie', 'Nelson', 'informative', 'such', 'wonderful', 'vocal', 'quality', 'could', 'almost', 'imagine', 'being', 'narrator', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'was', 'quot', 'TAKEN', 'quot', 'Jessie', 'Nelson', 'very', 'compassionate', 'project', 'director', 'should', 'be', 'So', 'much', 'probably', 'first', 'time', ""'d"", 'describe', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'being', 'beautiful.Also', 'DVD', 'Theatrical', 'trailer', 'Original', 'Documentary', 'quot', 'Becoming', 'Sam', 'quot', 'fascinating', 'look', 'what', 'took', 'put', 'movie', 'together', 'as', 'well', 'Deleted', 'Alternate', 'Scenes', 'optional', 'director', 'commentary', 'Also', 'featured', 'Region', '1', 'US', 'DVD', 'version', 'DVD-ROM', 'CONTENT', 'including', 'Script-to-Screen', 'Link', 'Original', 'Website', 'Hot', 'Spot', 'movie', 'Widescreen', 'anamorphic', 'format.I', 'met', 'Sam', 'maybe', 'should', 'meet', 'too']",I am Sam

701659,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B000066HAS,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[3, 7]","When I first began to watch this movie, I squirmed a lot mentally.  However, I think that squirming had more to do with not being comfortable with mentally challenged people than the quality of the movie.  This movie once again reminded me how much I admire people who work with the handicapped.Sean Penn does an outstanding job of portraying mentally challenged Sam Dawson.  Sam has the intelligence of a 7-year-old, which means his 7-year-old daughter, the incredibly adorable Dakota Fanning playing Lucy Diamond Dawson, is rapidly passing him in intellectual capacity.  As with many movies of this type, events happen that cause ""The Authorities"" to take Lucy away from Sam.  Sam obtains a lawyer, Rita Harrison, played by Michelle Pfeiffer, to win his daughter back.  Diane Wiest plays Annie, a concerned and intelligent neighbor with some bizarre mental problems of her own.  Laura Dern plays Randy, a foster parent interested in adopting the adorable Lucy because clearly she and her husband can give Lucy a better home and life than Sam.Before I give you the critical comments, I want you to understand that I liked this movie.  I thought it was uplifting and positive.  Sean Penn did an outstanding job comparable to that of Leonardo DiCaprio in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"".  Though I didn't care for all of the interpretations of The Beatles music, any movie which features Beatles music must have some merit.Okay, my less than positive comments:  I thought Michelle Pfeiffer did a wonderful job.  However, in places she was a little over the top.  I thought one of her best moments was when she broke down with Sam, admitting that while Sam thought she was ""perfect"", she was anything but.  I think that the director had a great actress and should have let her do her job, and not directed her the way he did, which led to places where she is unbelievable.  Laura Dern was a serious disappointment.  Laura has a lot of ability (see ""Mask"" as an example), but here the majority of her acting is providing these ""looks"" of disapproval or approval or whatever.  Very annoying.  Again, I credit the director with making less than maximum use of a very good actress.  One last negative comment.  When Sam got all dressed up for court with a suit provided to him by Rita, and then had him going to work at Starbucks, I knew immediately that he was going to get something all over the suit.  Everybody watching the movie knew it too.  The actors in the movie should have known it as well.  If I had a court date and worked at Starbucks, I guarantee you the suit would have not been on until shortly before my court appearance.  And somehow all of the ""intelligent"" people around Sam couldn't foresee and prevent this from happening.  Makes me wonder who the mentally challenged person in the movie was.Some more positive comments:  Dakota Fanning is a name we will be hearing more about in the future.  An absolutely adorable little girl who was perfectly believable throughout the movie.  The other mentally challenged characters in the movie were also believable.  The Beatles music was well matched to the various scenes of the movie.  The Beatles trivia was really interesting, and factual.I'm not sure what to say about the bobbling camera.  There were places where it was used to try and give you a ""real life"" kind of feel.  In a few places it was a little distracting.  Eventually I got used to it as I became involved with the characters and the story.Conclusion:  I would definitely watch the movie again, though not for a while.  Not a ""must buy"" for me, though if you are into character stories, this movie could be a good one for your collection.",4,Sean Penn Shines,1035676800,"10 27, 2002",2002,3664,"['When', 'first', 'began', 'watch', 'movie', 'squirmed', 'lot', 'mentally', 'However', 'think', 'squirming', 'had', 'more', 'do', 'not', 'being', 'comfortable', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'people', 'quality', 'movie', 'movie', 'once', 'again', 'reminded', 'how', 'much', 'admire', 'people', 'who', 'work', 'handicapped.Sean', 'Penn', 'outstanding', 'job', 'portraying', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'Sam', 'Dawson', 'Sam', 'intelligence', '7-year-old', '7-year-old', 'daughter', 'incredibly', 'adorable', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'playing', 'Lucy', 'Diamond', 'Dawson', 'rapidly', 'passing', 'intellectual', 'capacity', 'many', 'movies', 'type', 'events', 'happen', 'cause', 'Authorities', 'take', 'Lucy', 'away', 'Sam', 'Sam', 'lawyer', 'Rita', 'Harrison', 'played', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'win', 'daughter', 'back', 'Diane', 'Wiest', 'Annie', 'concerned', 'intelligent', 'neighbor', 'bizarre', 'mental', 'problems', 'own', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'Randy', 'foster', 'parent', 'interested', 'adopting', 'adorable', 'Lucy', 'clearly', 'husband', 'can', 'give', 'Lucy', 'better', 'home', 'life', 'Sam.Before', 'give', 'critical', 'comments', 'want', 'understand', 'liked', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'uplifting', 'positive', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'did', 'outstanding', 'job', 'comparable', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'What', 'Eating', 'Gilbert', 'Grape', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'interpretations', 'Beatles', 'music', 'movie', 'Beatles', 'music', 'must', 'have', 'merit.Okay', 'less', 'positive', 'comments', 'thought', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'However', 'places', 'was', 'little', 'top', 'thought', 'one', 'best', 'moments', 'was', 'when', 'broke', 'down', 'Sam', 'admitting', 'Sam', 'thought', 'was', 'perfect', 'was', 'anything', 'think', 'director', 'had', 'great', 'actress', 'should', 'have', 'let', 'do', 'job', 'not', 'directed', 'way', 'did', 'led', 'places', 'where', 'unbelievable', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'was', 'serious', 'disappointment', 'Laura', 'lot', 'ability', 'see', 'Mask', 'example', 'here', 'majority', 'acting', 'providing', 'looks', 'disapproval', 'approval', 'Very', 'annoying', 'Again', 'credit', 'director', 'making', 'less', 'maximum', 'use', 'very', 'good', 'actress', 'One', 'last', 'negative', 'comment', 'When', 'Sam', 'got', 'dressed', 'up', 'court', 'suit', 'provided', 'Rita', 'then', 'had', 'going', 'work', 'Starbucks', 'knew', 'immediately', 'was', 'going', 'get', 'something', 'suit', 'Everybody', 'watching', 'movie', 'knew', 'too', 'actors', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'as', 'well', 'had', 'court', 'date', 'worked', 'Starbucks', 'guarantee', 'suit', 'would', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'shortly', 'court', 'appearance', 'somehow', 'intelligent', 'people', 'Sam', 'could', ""n't"", 'foresee', 'prevent', 'happening', 'Makes', 'wonder', 'who', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'person', 'movie', 'was.Some', 'more', 'positive', 'comments', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'name', 'will', 'be', 'hearing', 'more', 'future', 'absolutely', 'adorable', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'perfectly', 'believable', 'movie', 'other', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'characters', 'movie', 'were', 'also', 'believable', 'Beatles', 'music', 'was', 'well', 'matched', 'various', 'scenes', 'movie', 'Beatles', 'trivia', 'was', 'really', 'interesting', 'factual.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'say', 'bobbling', 'camera', 'were', 'places', 'where', 'was', 'used', 'try', 'give', 'real', 'life', 'kind', 'feel', 'few', 'places', 'was', 'little', 'distracting', 'Eventually', 'got', 'used', 'became', 'involved', 'characters', 'story.Conclusion', 'would', 'definitely', 'watch', 'movie', 'again', 'not', 'while', 'Not', 'must', 'buy', 'are', 'character', 'stories', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'good', 'one', 'collection']",I am Sam

701665,A3J510E9W1CJ1K,B000066HAS,mashby,"[4, 8]","I saw this movie the same weekend that I saw John Q and I have to say that this was on the exact opposite end of the spectrum even though it's in the same genre! How is it on the opposite? Simply put, the emotions that it illicit are genuine.Just from reading the plot above, I think it's fair to say that that there is a high chance that this movie could be a simple sob story that goes for the cliche in order to get you to cry. That NEVER happens in this film. Every emotion, although sometimes gut wrenching, is elicited genuinely from the actors and the story. I should also mention that I grew up next door to a mentally challenged neighbor, so I have had experience with the subject. Although Sam is clearly at the upper end of the spectrum in terms of mental deficiency, Penn nails the role and I think it's one of the best performances of his life. Playing the role of a retarded person is not easy. It's not just a matter of talking funny, or acting stupid - Penn clearly illustrates that fact. Not to mention that he's able to hold the screen acting opposite a child and 5 dogs!In conjunction with Penn's performance, the writing is truly incredible. It's realistic and doesn't portray any of the characters as caricatures of themselves. Richard Schiff, for example, could have been portrayed as simply &quot;the bad guy&quot; in his role as Turner, State's Attorney. It would have been an easy choice for the writer's to make and unfortunately, it's a choice that many movies tend to make. Instead, Turner is portrayed as someone doing his job and looking out for the best interests of the child. Although it's one of the more minor roles of the film, the fact that none of characters were &quot;throw away&quot; just goes to how how well the script was written.One other element that is often overlooked is the cinematography. Elliot Davis really gives this movie a unique style and feel in his photography and actually plays a role in telling the story. As the color pallets change for the perspective it makes it easier to tell where the perspective has changed as well. One of my favorite scenes involves the Sam in the courtroom and Davis' use of 4 cameras to capture the scene coupled with Richard Chew's editing makes that scene so compelling.Lastly, I have to mention the performances given by the lead women in the cast. Michelle Pfeiffer, who plays Sam's lawyer Rita Harrison, gives one of her best performances in her career. The arc that she is able to take her character is not easy. She goes from being someone who has very little in the way of redeeming qualities to someone you can deeply care for. She really stretched herself in this role and took some chances that pay off in spades. And last, but not least, Dakota Fanning plays Sam's daughter Lucy. I haven't seen Dakota in any other films yet, but now I want to. Although playing a child, when you're a child isn't much of a stretch, having to play a child that understands the mentally challenged is. The script gives her everything she needs for the scene, but Dakota has to deliver it and she does. Her talent is well beyond her years and the emotion she is able to convey through her eyes and in her reactions to other characters is truly impressive. Her role could have been the weak link that brought the movie to a much lower level, but she proved to be one of it's anchors.Make no mistake about it, this is a tear jerker, but in the best sense of the word. It's an honest look at a unique situation that shows us many facets and pulls no punches.",5,Better have a box of Kleenex for this one.,1063929600,"09 19, 2003",2003,3538,"['saw', 'movie', 'same', 'weekend', 'saw', 'John', 'Q', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'exact', 'opposite', 'end', 'spectrum', 'even', 'same', 'genre', 'How', 'opposite', 'Simply', 'put', 'emotions', 'are', 'genuine.Just', 'reading', 'plot', 'think', 'fair', 'say', 'high', 'chance', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'simple', 'sob', 'story', 'cliche', 'order', 'get', 'cry', 'NEVER', 'film', 'emotion', 'sometimes', 'gut', 'wrenching', 'elicited', 'genuinely', 'actors', 'story', 'should', 'also', 'mention', 'grew', 'up', 'next', 'door', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'neighbor', 'have', 'had', 'experience', 'subject', 'Sam', 'clearly', 'upper', 'end', 'spectrum', 'terms', 'mental', 'deficiency', 'Penn', 'role', 'think', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'life', 'Playing', 'role', 'retarded', 'person', 'not', 'easy', 'not', 'just', 'matter', 'talking', 'funny', 'acting', 'stupid', 'Penn', 'clearly', 'fact', 'Not', 'mention', 'able', 'hold', 'screen', 'acting', 'opposite', 'child', '5', 'dogs', 'conjunction', 'Penn', 'performance', 'writing', 'truly', 'incredible', 'realistic', ""n't"", 'portray', 'characters', 'caricatures', 'Richard', 'Schiff', 'example', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'portrayed', 'simply', 'quot', 'bad', 'guy', 'quot', 'role', 'Turner', 'State', 'Attorney', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'easy', 'choice', 'writer', 'make', 'unfortunately', 'choice', 'many', 'movies', 'tend', 'make', 'Instead', 'Turner', 'portrayed', 'someone', 'doing', 'job', 'looking', 'out', 'best', 'interests', 'child', 'one', 'more', 'minor', 'roles', 'film', 'fact', 'none', 'characters', 'were', 'quot', 'throw', 'away', 'quot', 'just', 'how', 'how', 'well', 'script', 'was', 'written.One', 'other', 'element', 'often', 'overlooked', 'cinematography', 'Elliot', 'Davis', 'really', 'movie', 'unique', 'style', 'feel', 'photography', 'actually', 'role', 'telling', 'story', 'color', 'pallets', 'change', 'perspective', 'easier', 'tell', 'where', 'perspective', 'changed', 'as', 'well', 'One', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'Sam', 'courtroom', 'Davis', 'use', '4', 'cameras', 'capture', 'scene', 'coupled', 'Richard', 'Chew', 'editing', 'scene', 'so', 'compelling.Lastly', 'have', 'mention', 'performances', 'given', 'lead', 'women', 'cast', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'who', 'Sam', 'lawyer', 'Rita', 'Harrison', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'career', 'arc', 'able', 'take', 'character', 'not', 'easy', 'being', 'someone', 'who', 'very', 'little', 'way', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'someone', 'can', 'deeply', 'care', 'really', 'stretched', 'role', 'took', 'chances', 'pay', 'off', 'spades', 'last', 'not', 'least', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'Sam', 'daughter', 'Lucy', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Dakota', 'other', 'films', 'yet', 'now', 'want', 'playing', 'child', 'when', ""'re"", 'child', ""n't"", 'much', 'stretch', 'having', 'play', 'child', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'script', 'everything', 'scene', 'Dakota', 'deliver', 'talent', 'well', 'years', 'emotion', 'able', 'convey', 'eyes', 'reactions', 'other', 'characters', 'truly', 'impressive', 'role', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'weak', 'link', 'brought', 'movie', 'much', 'lower', 'level', 'proved', 'be', 'one', 'anchors.Make', 'mistake', 'tear', 'jerker', 'best', 'sense', 'word', 'honest', 'look', 'unique', 'situation', 'many', 'facets', 'punches']",I am Sam

Instead of letting it sit and gather dust until I happen to be in the mood for it. Like most of my ""to watch"" pile is.I Am Sam is one of those gems of movies that just has to be seen. From the sweetness of Sam, to the sarcasticness of Michelle Pfeiffer, to Dakota Fanning's debut film role. Each character has a role to fill, and the film could have so failed miserably, but each star makes their role special. Sean was unbelievable as Sam, although there are influences from Rain Man. He captures every emotion perfectly, of a bewildered father, from putting on a nappy (with badges), to reading to his daughter, to trying to work out life without her. And trying to deal with making coffees for demanding customers.He has a kind of support network around him. His developmentally disabled friends, and Dianne Wiest as his neighbour, they help him raise Lucy each in their own unique way.When Sam gets accidentally arrested, he needs a lawyer, preferably a lawyer that will work for $8 an hour, which is what he earns. Enter Rita, a woman who's husband works late every night, a son is stuck in the middle of warring parents, and a demanding job. She initally struggles with Sam, but by the end of the movie, her eyes have been opened, after having an almost breakdown of sorts and she gets shot of her no good husband.I'm not sure about the soundtrack to the film, mainly featuring other artists singing Beatles tracks. I'm not old enough to remember the Beatles in their hey day, and I didn't grow up with my parents listening to their music, so that whole theme to the movie was a bit lost to me. Quite a few Beatles references are there and I guess it would mean much more to a Beatles fan. I just wasn't keen on it.I do think there should have been more in the background of Dianne Wiest's character, as there's only a small revelation late in the movie, but I'm not sure if that would have detracted from the movie. I would have liked to have found out more about her anyway.It's an extremely hard film to watch at times, but I would definitely recommend it, for Sean Penn's role alone.

Sam Dawson was diagnosed severely retarded as a child.  We meet Sam as an adult, working in a Starbuck's coffee shop, rushing to the hospital to witness the birth of his daughter.  Fond of The Beatles, Sam names the baby Lucy Diamond Dawson.  Lucy's mother wants nothing to do with Sam or their daughter.  She takes off as soon as they leave the hospital.  With the help of his mentally challenged friends and the eccentric recluse Annie, Sam raises Lucy in his tiny apartment.  She grows up to become a well-rounded, highly intelligent little girl.  Lucy's feelings about her father alternate between contentment and embarrassment.  When Sam is arrested for solicitation, his family situation comes under scrutiny.  Believing that a man with the mind of a 7-year-old can not effectively raise a child, Lucy is taken from Sam.  Sam enlists the aid of hyperactive, cold-hearted lawyer, Rita Harrison.Keep your Kleenex handy!  You'll alternate between hysterical laughter and boughts of tears.  Sam's fight to get custody of Lucy changes the lives of those around him.  You begin to realize that Sam has almost everything a father can offer a child, and begin to root for him and his struggle.  Even his lawyer has something to learn from Sam.Sean Penn's performance in this movie is incredible.  He really did his homework on this one!  Very believable!  Dakota Fanning plays the intelligent, insightful Lucy.  This child's career is one to watch - a bright shining new star.

But there is also material that falls flat, in particular some courtroom scenes that struck me as too soap opera-ish.

I spoke to my sister, who works as a professional with special-needs children and their families, and she agreed that ""Sam"" sounded a bit fishy.

701679,AUDSM2CTLLW1Q,B000066HAS,Patrick L. Randall,"[11, 16]","Chicago Sun Times film critic Roger Ebert makes a very interesting point in movie reviews when he says the playing a mentally handicapped person is one of the easiest (and least impressive) acting jobs.  Any role involving a handicapped person basically directs itself.  It's not terribly hard for an actor to assume the mannerisms of a person with a disability.  Yet, it often proves to be one of the most manipulative acting conventions out there.  Audiences tend to get emotionally moved by actors in such roles without truly realizing that most of these actors bring little or no depth to the character they're playing.  A classic movie where an actor played a mentally handicapped individual and was able to do so in a way that provided depth and genuine emotion was &quot;Rain Man&quot; with Dustin Hoffman in that role.Unfortunately, the movie &quot;I Am Sam&quot; does not provide that kind of depth of character in Sean Penn's portrayal of Sam Dawson, a handicapped person with the mental capacity of a 7-year old.  Sam unwittingly got a homeless woman pregnant and, after the birth of his daughter, is left to raise the child by himself when the woman just runs away after delivery.  It's quite possible that a touching movie could have been made out of this premise had the powers that be not decided that the messages of &quot;handicapped people can be good parents&quot; and &quot;all you need is love&quot; needed to be drilled home every 5 minutes.  Almost anytime Sam is asked a question or forced to deal with something complex, he resorts to quoting Beatles' lyrics and lore.  This seems to be the director's way heavy-handed way of showing the audience that all the answers to life can be found in the Beatles' music.  Much more disconcerting than Sam's attempts to raise his daughter Lucy (as in 'in the Sky with Diamonds'... ha ha.. get it?), is Lucy's dialogue with Sam.  She may well be very intelligent for her age (7 years), but some of her dialogue is uncomfortably grownup.  Of all the children I have known in my life, I have never known a 7-year old who would spout comments like Lucy does.  It's very clear that the directors put more adult dialogue in the script for her to recite in order for her to seem more intelligent and, I guess, providing a more 'touching' contrast with Sam.The rest of the movie surrounds a perfunctory court case where the state is trying to take Lucy away from Sam because they do not think he is a fit father.  This, of course, brings out yuppie lawyer Michelle Pfeiffer (in her worst performance since &quot;Scarface&quot;) agreeing to do this case pro-bono and, of course, learning from Sam the truly important lessons in life.  The court scenes bring out every conceivable cliche' and melodramatic acting from Pfeiffer objecting to just about everything opposing counsel says to emotionally overwrought speaches by Sam, Pfeiffer's character, and a so-called 'expert' witness.  The movie, itself, is quite insulting in its treatment of the subject matter and is aggravating in its insistence on reminding you that you're watching and important 'message' movie.  Interestingly enough, the best acting performance in this movie comes from one of Sam's friends, Brad, who's portrayer, Brad Silverman, actually has Down Syndrome.  His words and actions are very genuine, and the director would have been well advised to pattern Sean Penn's performance on how Brad carries himself in everyday life.This movie is terribly heavy-handed and manipulative.

701682,A84AEJVJBK4FX,B000066HAS,Peaches O'Brien,"[2, 4]","""I am Sam"" is both repellent and fascinating. It took me an entire day to finish the film. I'd watch a few minutes 'til Sam did something so cringe-worthy I'd shut off the TV out of reflex, then be drawn back an hour later because I had to see what happened next, even though I was well aware I was watching dishonest, manipulative garbage. I guess I was fascinated by how pretty they were able to package it.Sean Penn is often able to extract and convey the humanity in misunderstood, unpopular people, helping balance out the generally insensitive status quo; other times he's empathetic to a fault.Unlike Dustin Hoffman's detached but strangely engaged portrayal of autistic Raymond in ""Rain Man,"" I was always aware of Penn steering Sam (who is described as retarded with autistic tendencies), manipulating him to match the film's theme of ""All you need is love."" The theme is a nice sentiment, but pragmatically irresponsible given the subject matter.Penn's Sam Dawson isn't as irresponsible as Penn's Sam Bicke in the semi-true, ""The Assassination of Richard Nixon,"" which had Penn as a humiliated, desperate everyman, leaving out important history about the real Bicke (Byck) that drove him to the assassination attempt. (Without knowing this it's a far more compelling performance.)""I am Sam"" does a big disservice omitting important information about the circumstances that led to Sam Dawson making a baby.The film starts with close-ups of Sam obsessively organizing sweeteners and cups at Starbucks, complimenting people on their coffee choices. His boss George tells him it's time for him to go. Sam gets excited and runs over to the hospital where a woman is giving birth. A nurse asks him, ""You the one responsible for this?"" And Sam says he's sorry.Afterward, the mother abandons Sam and the newborn, saying ""I just needed a place to sleep."" I guess you could infer it was the mother's idea to make the baby, which could be supported by a scene later in the film where Sam is in a food court conversing with a woman, oblivious he's being propositioned -- but this wasn't enough to ease my concern.For seven years, Sam is able to take care of his daughter Lucy (Dakota Fanning, ""Hounddog"") without too many problems. He named her after the Beatles song ""Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds"" because he's a big Beatles fan. Their music plays a prominent part in the film, with the soundtrack primarily comprised of contemporary artists (Eddie Vedder, Sheryl Crow, The Black Crowes to name a few) covering their songs.Sam has a few fellow mentally challenged friends who help him with Lucy. He also has Annie (Diane Wiest) as Lucy's godmother, an agoraphobic neighbor who helps answer Sam's many child rearing questions, which include giving him a feeding schedule based on Nikelodeon's TV schedule:Starting with ""'Hogan's Heroes' Then again, wait until ""I Dream of Jeanie,' and then `I Love Lucy.'""His friends' main activities are going to IHOP and ""Video Night."" One of them is obsessed with Victor Flemming, another guy is paranoid, and another one really wants to see ""Kramer vs. Kramer.""One night, Lucy wants to go to Big Boy instead of IHOP. Sam throws a fit when the waitress tells him they don't have French pancakes. ""Ask Bob! Bob's Big Boy! Because the customer is always right! The customer is always right! The customer is always right!"" Lucy is embarrassed.Cut to a scene of Sam dressed up as a young Beatle, flailing his arms to the Wallflowers cover of ""I'm Looking Through You"" with an embarrassed Lucy and her schoolmates during a Halloween party.Lucy (Dakota Fanning, ""Hounddog"") is taken from Sam during a birthday party by a social worker (Loretta Devine from TV's ""Boston Public"") after Sam is determined to have the IQ of a seven year old. The social workers are concerned Sam won't have the ability to take care of Lucy when she gets older.Sam finds a fancy lawyer named Rita (Michelle Pfeifer, who is still quite the Ladyhawke) and stalks her and manages to quote both ""Lovely Rita"" and ""Michelle"" to her. Rita ignores him until some of her colleagues mock her when she says she has considered doing pro bono work before.The concern about Sam's baby-making is brought up once: while questioning neighbor Annie, the prosecution asks her about Sam's competency when puberty comes. Annie says he would have as much difficulty as any other father - she's lived a long life and has observed all kinds of fathers. The prosecution then asks her: What about your father? The camera does one of those dolly/zooms like when the boy on the raft got eaten in ""Jaws,"" and Annie quietly leaves the room.Then Sam defends himself by quoting a courtroom scene from ""Kramer vs Kramer"" and loses the case.But Rita convinces him to keep going.As you've probably already noticed, the film has a strong supporting cast, which also includes Mary Steenburgen and Brent Spiner (Data from TV's ""Star Trek: Next Generation"" and cruise director Godwyn in ""Out to Sea"") in a brief appearance as a shoe salesman.Laura Dern (""Rambling Rose"") plays Randy Carpenter, Lucy's protective foster mother. She has a change of heart when Lucy won't stop sneaking out and visiting Sam. She agrees to be on Sam's side in court, and the film ends with the kids playing soccer and Sam giving Lucy (Dakota Fanning, ""Hounddog"") a big hug after she scores with Aimee Mann and Michael Penn's cover of ""Two of Us"" on the soundtrack.I guess I just wanted more interaction between lawyer Rita and Turner, the prosecutor. As it is, ""I am Sam"" feels as if the filmmakers cheated the ending and tried to blind the audience with shmaltz.Which brings me to the cinematography. Elliot Davis uses small zooms and jerks to emphasize every emotion, as if with every movement he's saying, ""Feel this, because I know you can't without me!"" Calm down, Elliot.The DVD features audio commentary, a documentary ""Becoming Sam,"" which wasn't as insightful as I'd hoped it would be, deleted/alternate scenes, which I didn't bother watching, and some cool folding/unfolding origami menus, which were probably my favorite thing about the whole disc.The soundtrack is better than the movie. I suspect people will probably buy more of it than the ""Hounddog"" soundtrack. Personally, I'm waiting for the ""Do the Right Thing"" CD reissue, featuring Radio Raheem's ""Fight the Power"" m-m-m-mash-up with ""Fairytale of New York"" and ""Close to You,"" topped with

However, it gave this movie a pedestal for Sean Penn to display his acting talent.  It's timely that he's been given an Oscar for his portrayal of a tormented father in &quot;Mystic River&quot;.  He's arguably one of the best but under-rated actors of all time.  He's so versatile &amp; when he's on-screen, I couldn't keep my eyes off him.  In this instance, he portrayed an autistic &amp; retarded father (IQ of a seven years old) to an extremely bright daughter.  He sought help from an over-the-top lawyer (played by Michelle Pfeiffer) to win his daughter back from the system as Social Welfare believed that the daughter needs a balanced environment for her growth.  Despite that Sean's character provided her with a lot of loving, her growth is stifled somewhat for her relucance to be &quot;better&quot; than her dad.  Sean's mannerism, body language, speech is truly believable.  The DVD came with many deleted scenes where we get to see more acting talents (particularly his improvisation) of Sean Penn.  Moreover, we have an in-depth look at the research, casting, production, direction, et cetera.  This movie is rather heart-warming.  Some people reckoned this movie could be over the top or cheesy but truth to be told, it's a rather remarkable family movie.  The supporting cast (some of them mentally challenged in real life), Laura Dern, Diane Wiest are great.

I was expecting a serious dramatic style of film making, but instead the picture takes a much different direction with cinematography that is as jolty, playfull, lively and giggly as the upbeat and often wacky styled soundtrack innermingled with various artists versions of classic Beatles songs. Yes I was sort of confused by this strange sort of style to the film, then it dawned on me. The film was setting the mood and style that reflected perhaps the inner child of the character Sean Penn plays who is emotionally challenged and has the mind of a 7 year old. After about half an hour the entire approach to making the film as they did felt uplifting and refreshing, even though the inner working of the story was a very sad situation where this emotionally challenged individual and his daughter want to be together but are forced by the legal system to be apart. That having been said, Sean Penn was incredibly authentic and moving in this role. Dakota Fanning as his daughter was simply brilliant as well, the tables switched here where Penn plays the child and Fanning the greatly adult-minded daughter. Throwing the ever so Great Michelle Pheiffer into the mix as an over worked and irritable Lawyer who slowly warms up to Penn's character and learns to slow down and smell the Latte, and you've got the perfect blend for a great film.

But neither can save the script from its pitfalls, namely, an unrealistic portrayal of a grown man with the mind of a seven year old.  None of the characters come of seeming like real people so much as types. Even his daughter (the annoying Fanning) is more HOllywood precociousness about her than real-life childlike qualities.

There are a few exceptions: Cuckoo's Nest & Rain Man immediately come to mind, and not to forget What's Eating Gilbert Grape (where Leonardo was nothing short of flawless). I Am Sam is such a film, with Sean Penn giving a thorough, heart-felt (and highly lauded) performance. There are issues, however, and the only time he really has to prove his 7-year old mentality is the perfectly uncomfortable temper tantrum he has at Bob's Big Boy. Michelle Pfeiffer is also excellent as a personally conflicted high-priced lawyer, who has enough problems of her own, while helping poor Sam. I won't blab away the plot, other than a disabled man is trying to retain custody of his daughter. There are so many wonderful performances in this film, including a cache of Sam's supportive cronies, also with various disabilities. Among these, Doug Hutchison (The Green Mile) finally has a role worthy of his talents, albeit it a minor role. I would like to see him more often. Wonderful supporting roles from Dianne Wiest, Richard Schiff, Loretta Devine and the always reliable Laura Dern are perfect. Most stunning is the intuitive, confident and complete performance of young Dakota Fanning (nominated by SAG). Children often see things that we ""grown-ups"" aren't in tune with; she's a smart, loving daughter who's all too aware that dad isn't ""normal"", and when her intelligence surpasses his, she is afraid; such a loving performance, and so natural. Director Jessie Nelson is all too aware of the sensitivity involved. The DVD extras are plentiful and insightful. This is truly a labor of love. Even at 2 hours, I was never bored. This controversial subject matter will always concern viewers regarding it's sensitivity level. In Ms. Nelson's hands, one must not worry about that.

Another thing was the directing, trying to cash in on the Steven Soderbergh-like camera work similar to that of Traffic, only in this film the camera should have been steady. Don't get me wrong, it is a good movie except for just a couple of scenes. It is however disappointing that Sean Penn did not get the Oscar for this one because it is very believable. There's just no limit to his talent! Michell Pfeiffer also plays good in this as the somewhat ""bitchy"" lawyer who becomes his friend. There were some funny moments as well, like the scene with the cake, or several others where he is among his friends.

Eventually the social workers found out about him through the teacher at the school his daughter attends, and they try to take away his daughter and put her into foster care because they think he isn't mentally capable of raising a child. Due to the unusual circumstances that ensue partly due to Sean Penn's persistent efforts at getting the best lawyer (Michelle Pfeiffer) to help him regain custody of his daughter, Michelle decides to help him out and in the process develops a meaningful friendship with Sean.This movie really tries to do a few things. It shows us the negative attitude that society has towards people with mental illness. Does having a high IQ mean one is more than capable of being a better parent than another person with a low IQ (or a mental illness)? We're not talking about people with psychotic/violent mental illnesses here. The movie tries to tell us is that love is very important. We live in a world which can be so heartless sometimes, so impersonal and so distant. A lot of us get caught up in the games and the rat races, and we even start to believe that this is really what the world is about - money, status, power. Every now and then, we are lucky enough to witness a small gesture of care and love to remind us that there is more to life than just the work and the money. In this movie though, you'll find LOADS of scenes which convey true love and care - not the kind of erotic, passionate love between lovers, but the kind of warmth and empathy and goodwill that lights up the grey in our skies.Michelle Pfeiffer put in a great performance as well, and so did Dakota Fanning as Sean Penn's daughter in the film. I like Laura Dern's performance too. Just so many things I like about this movie - the music, the artwork, the acting... A pity, I think, that this movie will probably not move the hearts of those who are into bloody violence and gore that is so predominant in Hollywood movies today. This is a drama film - the emotions that the actors convey, its all about paying attention to the words and the meaning in each scene...

He works as a server at Starbucks, is obsessed with The Beatles, and loves IHOP. After he accidentally has a daughter (Dakota Fanning) with a homeless woman who he names after the song Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds. The woman leaves him, and Sam is left to care for Lucy by himself. However, when Lucy intentionally begins to hold back in school to prevent becoming smarter from her father, child protective services takes her away and Sam must fight to obtain custody. He befriends a lawyer, Rita (Michelle Pfeiffer) with a bad marriage and a son who she thinks hates her. Together, Sam and Rita fight for Lucy's custody in a heartwrenching roller coaster of tears, laughs, and the overwhelming power of human spirit.This is all beside some of the most stunning performances I've ever seen in a film.

701707,A359IT81FBX64Y,B000066HAS,Steven Mason,"[11, 13]","This is the most shamelessly cloying movie I have yet seen. A man with the mental capacity of a 7-year-old can't possibly raise a child, period, end of subject. This would be an amazing enough story if only to show how such a man could take care of himself, living more or less independently. But not only is Sam able to take care of himself, working at a minimum wage job and living in a nice apartment, he is also able to raise a child and somehow afford all the expenses. Apparently there is a lot I could learn from Sam!The child is the best and the worst part of the story. She is so cute, so sweet, so intelligent, so wise, so affectionate, and so loyal that any parents watching her will melt in the fantasy that their own normal kids could be half as good. In one courtroom scene a witness testifies that the girl is so smart not in spite of her father's shortcomings but because of his love and constancy. I suppose something can be said for always eating dinner at House of Pancakes and reading Green Eggs and Ham a hundred times each night.The courtroom scenes were funny. Any witness expressing a concern for Sam's ability to be a competent, responsible parent was discredited for some secret and devastating failing in her personal life. In other words, if normal parents make mistakes, get confused, and mess up then who's to say that Sam, with the capacity of a 7-year-old, would do any worse? In fact he may do better.Then there is the awkward scene when Sam's beautiful lawyer Rita (Michelle Pfeiffer) puts a suit and tie on him and for a brief instant seems to feel enough attraction to consider a pro bono tryst. After all, her husband is cheating on her, so why not?What I enjoyed most about the movie were the Beatles' songs performed by various cover artists. But it's a fantasy to think that to raise a child in Los Angeles ""all you need is love.""

Penn never missed a beat, It could've looked overblown and a freak show but he made it really compelling and sensitive. Fanning is probably one of the few young actors who exhibited such great depth as an actress that even actors twice or thrice her age could only imagine. Made you wonder where the hell she's getting all this emotions. Pfeiffer though good is I guess the most obvious casualty of the weakness of the script. Her character started from being a total bitch to a sympathetic compassionate character without any subtlety. It wasn't developed enough. In one key scene where she had a breakdown, she seemed more like a complaining brat instead of really having a breakdown and a little tear could've helped the scene a little bit. The script really hindered Pfeiffer to just nail this part because there's no doubt she's one of the best actresses around.It's a good film to watch in a cold night, the ending might be a little overblown and mushy but I guess ultimately a satisfying closure.

701711,A4OQ81P4JMAOT,B000066HAS,"The Aeolian Kid ""YOWZA!""","[1, 1]","""I AM SAM"" ... Indeed! ... Sean Penn is a great actor. He definitely became SAM in this movie. It is undeniable that his performance as a loving father and single parent of a little girl who loves him with all her heart is incredibly moving. That Sam is mentally challenged is beside the point. The point being that he loves his daughter, Lucy, with all his heart as well and wants to be with her to raise her and enjoy her company, enjoying watching her grow up as all loving parents want to do with their children.I watched this movie on DVD fives times in a row. I fell in love with it. The cast is outstanding and so believable. Sam, truly, has the best friends in the world, and his attorney, ""Lovely Rita"" - Michelle Pfeiffer - does an excellent job of helping Sam to keep his daughter. If you want to see a door kicked in by Michelle Pfeiffer that is as emotionally powerful as it is sexy, then watch this movie! You will never see a door kicked in so gloriously again. It's worth it just to see her doing that. True passion!The music to this movie is Beatle-inspired. If you are a Beatles fan - like Sam and Lucy are - you will love this movie. If you are a fan of George Harrison, you will appreciate the line in the film when Rita says that he was always her favorite Beatle. If you know people who are mentally handicapped in any way, and realize what a challenge it is every day for all of them to function in this complex society, you will appreciate the sentiments of this movie. It is a wonderful expose into the world of the ""special people"" who share this life with us. You will come to love them for their uniqueness.""It matters to ME!"" says SAM to his attorney, while standing before the counter to buy coffee. (By the way, notice that Sam figures out the exact amount of change in his head perfectly!) This is one of the most powerful lines in the movie. It is a great turning point in the way his attorney begins to relate to him - as a human being with deep wounds and real needs, and not just as another client or pro-bono trophy case!The only question I have is, do Sam and Rita (his attorney) get together as romantic companions at the end of the film?

701713,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000066HAS,Tsuyoshi,"[6, 8]","&quot;I Am Sam&quot; belongs to a category of so-called &quot;love-or-hate&quot; movie because of its too sweet nature as a tearjerker, so I tried at first to concentrate on writing about what you see on the screen, but I failed.  Sorry, but I know my personal opinion would be reduced to nothing in front of your sentiments if you are a kind of a person who gets a handkerchief ready by your side before you start watching this film.  I know.Sean Penn is Sam, who is mentally-challenged, but has no trouble working at Starbucks Coffee, and he loves the Beatles so much that he memorizes many anecdotes of the Fab Four, and sometimes quotes them before his daughter Lucy (who is naturally named after the song &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot;).  They are living happily until the authority decides to &quot;protect&quot; Lucy from her father, questioning his capacity as father.  Through the courtroom scenes, with an accidental 'pro bono' help from lawyer Michelle Pfeiffer, Sam tries to take back his loved daughter.The best thing about this film is NOT, against your all  expectations, Sean Penn's acting, which has nothing wrong with itself, though.  As Roger Ebert rightly says, his bitter-sweet turn in Woody Allen's &quot;Sweet and Lowdown&quot; is better than this one, considering the depth and complicated portrait of the  character peppered with very sweet arrogance.  No, the best part of the movie comes from its soundtrack that consists of cover versions of the Beatles.  Culled mainly from their works of later era (around and after &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; and &quot;White Album&quot;), the songs are perfect.  But it is THE Beatles, so why not?  (One of the interesting thing that &quot;Two of Us&quot; is played by Aimee Mann and Michael Penn, yes, Sean's brother.)The worst part is, probably as you all agree, the script that wanders from one type of clithe to another, without knowing where to stop.  In fact, nothing rings true, after careful consideration.  Pfeiffer's lawyer, always high-strung, has troubles with her kid, and her hubby is away from home, presumably having affair with someone else (but do you when your wife is this gorgeous Pfeiffer?) and so on and on.  And about Sam -- this is the point -- he sometimes looks as if he is trying to blow up the case he possibly can win.  And his friends for that matter.  To make matters worse, new foster mather Laura Dern is NOT a cold-blooded monster who loves to beat the children.  No, she really loves the girl Lucy, it is clear, and Sam knows it.  So, why don't they think about the possibility of raising the kid TOGETHER?  Or, how about an idea of joint custody?  I don't know American legal system of today, but I know there's a way out.  They should have included another Beatle song: &quot;We Can Work it Out.&quot;Acting as a whole is, as I said, very good and convincing, and child actor Dakota Fanning is a real find.  Because of her and the excellent soundtrack, I give one more star to this two-star vehicle for Penn, whose talent is undeniable though I firmly believe that this is not the way he should be given an  Oscar.",3,Unashamed Tearjerker Has Some Good Things Though,1025136000,"06 27, 2002",2002,3124,"['quot', 'Am', 'Sam', 'quot', 'category', 'so-called', 'quot', 'love-or-hate', 'quot', 'movie', 'too', 'sweet', 'nature', 'tearjerker', 'tried', 'first', 'concentrate', 'writing', 'what', 'see', 'screen', 'failed', 'Sorry', 'know', 'personal', 'opinion', 'would', 'be', 'reduced', 'nothing', 'front', 'sentiments', 'are', 'kind', 'person', 'who', 'handkerchief', 'ready', 'side', 'start', 'watching', 'film', 'know.Sean', 'Penn', 'Sam', 'who', 'mentally-challenged', 'trouble', 'working', 'Starbucks', 'Coffee', 'Beatles', 'so', 'much', 'many', 'anecdotes', 'Fab', 'Four', 'sometimes', 'daughter', 'Lucy', 'who', 'naturally', 'named', 'song', 'quot', 'Lucy', 'Sky', 'Diamonds', 'quot', 'are', 'living', 'happily', 'authority', 'quot', 'quot', 'Lucy', 'father', 'questioning', 'capacity', 'father', 'courtroom', 'scenes', 'accidental', ""'pro"", 'bono', 'help', 'lawyer', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'Sam', 'take', 'back', 'loved', 'daughter.The', 'best', 'thing', 'film', 'NOT', 'expectations', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'acting', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'though', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'rightly', 'bitter-sweet', 'turn', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'quot', 'Sweet', 'Lowdown', 'quot', 'better', 'one', 'considering', 'depth', 'complicated', 'portrait', 'character', 'peppered', 'very', 'sweet', 'arrogance', 'No', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'soundtrack', 'cover', 'versions', 'Beatles', 'Culled', 'mainly', 'works', 'later', 'era', 'quot', 'Sgt', 'Pepper', 'quot', 'quot', 'White', 'Album', 'quot', 'songs', 'are', 'perfect', 'THE', 'Beatles', 'so', 'why', 'not', 'One', 'interesting', 'thing', 'quot', 'Two', 'Us', 'quot', 'played', 'Aimee', 'Mann', 'Michael', 'Penn', 'yes', 'Sean', 'brother', 'worst', 'part', 'probably', 'agree', 'script', 'one', 'type', 'clithe', 'knowing', 'where', 'stop', 'fact', 'nothing', 'rings', 'true', 'careful', 'consideration', 'Pfeiffer', 'lawyer', 'always', 'high-strung', 'troubles', 'kid', 'hubby', 'away', 'home', 'presumably', 'having', 'affair', 'someone', 'else', 'do', 'when', 'wife', 'gorgeous', 'Pfeiffer', 'so', 'Sam', 'point', 'sometimes', 'trying', 'blow', 'up', 'case', 'possibly', 'can', 'win', 'friends', 'matter', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'new', 'foster', 'mather', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'NOT', 'cold-blooded', 'monster', 'who', 'beat', 'children', 'No', 'really', 'girl', 'Lucy', 'clear', 'Sam', 'So', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'possibility', 'raising', 'kid', 'TOGETHER', 'how', 'idea', 'joint', 'custody', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'American', 'legal', 'system', 'today', 'know', 'way', 'out', 'should', 'have', 'included', 'Beatle', 'song', 'quot', 'Can', 'Work', 'Out.', 'quot', 'Acting', 'whole', 'said', 'very', 'good', 'convincing', 'child', 'actor', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'real', 'find', 'excellent', 'soundtrack', 'give', 'one', 'more', 'star', 'two-star', 'vehicle', 'Penn', 'talent', 'undeniable', 'firmly', 'believe', 'not', 'way', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'Oscar']",I am Sam
701714,A1H5E7O5BW2J13,B000066HAS,V.C.,"[5, 11]","I have to admit, this film had a touching idea and concept. But just like nearly every Hollywood film that tries to depict the life of the mentally challenged, the plot is highly unrealistic and predictable, overly sentimental, and relys too much on the whole ""all you need is love"" theme to make the audience believe that Sam is a responsible father, even though in reality he's not. Not to mention that some of the situations are just either ludicrous and so, well, Hollywood that the film loses its charm and sense of reality that it COULD have had.For one, yes, Sam is a wonderful father that really loves his daughter. But if he's as mentally challenged as the show tries to depict, then how was he able to afford a very nice apartment with a minimum wage job at Starbucks? Why did it take 7 years for the law to realize that Sam has the intelligence of a 7 year old? Why does he sometimes use big words on occassions, and at the end of the film suddenly comes out with an eloquent speech? And how many times does this film have to be reminded that Sam is mentally ill?Another flaw in this film was how forced it felt. For one, it's a no brainer that love is a great thing and that it can overcome many obstacles, but Hollywood seems to take it too literally. The only thing that people say to defend Sam's fatherhood is that ""he loves his daughter."" But yet everybody fails to realize that Sam, as wonderful a father he is, can't afford all the things that Lucy needs, and that he's literally a 7 year old in a grown man's body. Even when records show that he has autistic tendencies and mental retardation, all that Sam's lawyer (or Michelle Pfeiffer) can come up with is ""all those things don't undermine one's compacity to love."" I am sorry, but that's a bunch of BS. This film tries so badly to convince us that Sam is a good father that it starts to look ridiculous and downright irresponsible. Let's get real here, there's more to being a parent then simply being able to love your child. If one doesn't have the mental compacity to raise a child, then it's best that the child should be put into a better household. I think most sensible people can agree with that in the real world. This film is just a bunch of sentimental Hollywood fluff. Esp. the part when Michelle Pfieffer's character goes through a mental breakdown about all the trials and tribulations of her life. Was that supposed to make us feel more sorry for her than for Sam? Um, not quite, it was laughable. We know that nobody is perfect, but gimme a break, the scene was completely unnecessary and ridiculous.At the end, I was left disappointed. As somebody who has been raised around the mentally ill, there's absolutely nothing in this film that depicts reality. Absolutely nothing. And that's a shame, because i really felt that it had lots of potential. Hollywood should learn that if they are going to build a film around real life issues and people, they should at least be considerate to the sensitive reality of it that some people have actually experienced. The only plus side of this film was the acting from Dakota Fanning---even though I think this girl acts way too intelligent for me to believe that she's a 7-year old--- and Sean Pean. And I have to say this, Michelle Pfieffer is the most ANNOYING and overly dramatic actress I have ever seen on screen. Call me ""retarted"" for not raving about this film, but I am just expressing my opinion. It's not a bad movie, but it was way too sentimental and over-the-top with the ""all you need is love"" theme for it to be the least bit realistic and believable.",2,"Sweet and Charming, But Not Realistic",1132963200,"11 26, 2005",2005,3599,"['have', 'admit', 'film', 'had', 'touching', 'idea', 'concept', 'just', 'nearly', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'depict', 'life', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'plot', 'highly', 'unrealistic', 'predictable', 'overly', 'sentimental', 'relys', 'too', 'much', 'whole', 'need', 'love', 'theme', 'make', 'audience', 'believe', 'Sam', 'responsible', 'father', 'even', 'reality', 'not', 'Not', 'mention', 'situations', 'are', 'just', 'either', 'ludicrous', 'so', 'well', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'charm', 'sense', 'reality', 'COULD', 'have', 'had.For', 'one', 'yes', 'Sam', 'wonderful', 'father', 'really', 'daughter', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'show', 'depict', 'then', 'how', 'was', 'able', 'afford', 'very', 'nice', 'apartment', 'minimum', 'wage', 'job', 'Starbucks', 'Why', 'did', 'take', '7', 'years', 'law', 'realize', 'Sam', 'intelligence', '7', 'year', 'old', 'Why', 'sometimes', 'use', 'big', 'words', 'occassions', 'end', 'film', 'suddenly', 'out', 'eloquent', 'speech', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'film', 'have', 'be', 'reminded', 'Sam', 'mentally', 'ill', 'flaw', 'film', 'was', 'how', 'forced', 'felt', 'one', 'brainer', 'love', 'great', 'thing', 'can', 'overcome', 'many', 'obstacles', 'Hollywood', 'take', 'too', 'literally', 'only', 'thing', 'people', 'say', 'defend', 'Sam', 'fatherhood', 'daughter', 'yet', 'everybody', 'realize', 'Sam', 'wonderful', 'father', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'things', 'Lucy', 'literally', '7', 'year', 'old', 'grown', 'man', 'body', 'Even', 'when', 'records', 'show', 'autistic', 'tendencies', 'mental', 'retardation', 'Sam', 'lawyer', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'can', 'come', 'up', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'undermine', 'one', 'compacity', 'love', 'am', 'sorry', 'bunch', 'BS', 'film', 'so', 'badly', 'convince', 'Sam', 'good', 'father', 'look', 'ridiculous', 'downright', 'irresponsible', 'Let', 'get', 'real', 'here', 'more', 'being', 'parent', 'then', 'simply', 'being', 'able', 'love', 'child', 'one', ""n't"", 'have', 'mental', 'compacity', 'raise', 'child', 'then', 'best', 'child', 'should', 'be', 'put', 'better', 'household', 'think', 'most', 'sensible', 'people', 'can', 'agree', 'real', 'world', 'film', 'just', 'bunch', 'sentimental', 'Hollywood', 'fluff', 'Esp', 'part', 'when', 'Michelle', 'Pfieffer', 'character', 'mental', 'breakdown', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'life', 'Was', 'supposed', 'make', 'feel', 'more', 'sorry', 'Sam', 'Um', 'not', 'quite', 'was', 'laughable', 'know', 'nobody', 'perfect', 'gim', 'break', 'scene', 'was', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'end', 'was', 'left', 'disappointed', 'somebody', 'who', 'been', 'raised', 'mentally', 'ill', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'film', 'reality', 'Absolutely', 'nothing', 'shame', 'i', 'really', 'felt', 'had', 'lots', 'potential', 'Hollywood', 'should', 'learn', 'are', 'going', 'build', 'film', 'real', 'life', 'issues', 'people', 'should', 'least', 'be', 'considerate', 'sensitive', 'reality', 'people', 'have', 'actually', 'experienced', 'only', 'plus', 'side', 'film', 'was', 'acting', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', '-even', 'think', 'girl', 'way', 'too', 'intelligent', 'believe', '7-year', 'old', 'Sean', 'Pean', 'have', 'say', 'Michelle', 'Pfieffer', 'most', 'ANNOYING', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'actress', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'screen', 'Call', 'retarted', 'not', 'raving', 'film', 'am', 'just', 'expressing', 'opinion', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'sentimental', 'over-the-top', 'need', 'love', 'theme', 'be', 'least', 'bit', 'realistic', 'believable']",I am Sam

701716,A28O7EFLUY5UUL,B000066HAS,Yousaf Rehan,"[1, 5]","""I Am Sam"" is an exuisitely directed movie, with superb acting by Sean Penn and Michelle. The movie takes us into the depth of a mentally disabled persons mind, and how he touches us all from within. It also shows us the neglet he feels from the people around him. It maked us feel guilty about the fact that how we exepmt such people from our daily lives. How he struggles to get his daughter Lucy back is amazing. Amid having the mind of a seven year old, he goes through all extents, far above his capabilities, to get his daughter back. And at the end he does. We as normal people sometimes tend to take our abilities for granted, claiming that we have a lot of knowledge. But people such as Mr Dawson(Sean Penn), have far more abilities than us normal people. They have the ability to truly love from deep within and struggle to attain their goals.If such movies are further directed, I truly belive that we will learn to appreciate the abilities and rights of the ""Mentally Disabled"".",5,"One word to describe it; ""Pleasurableness""",1024876800,"06 24, 2002",2002,990,"['Am', 'Sam', 'exuisitely', 'directed', 'movie', 'superb', 'acting', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Michelle', 'movie', 'depth', 'mentally', 'disabled', 'persons', 'mind', 'how', 'also', 'neglet', 'people', 'maked', 'feel', 'guilty', 'fact', 'how', 'exepmt', 'such', 'people', 'daily', 'lives', 'How', 'get', 'daughter', 'Lucy', 'back', 'amazing', 'Amid', 'having', 'mind', 'seven', 'year', 'old', 'extents', 'far', 'capabilities', 'get', 'daughter', 'back', 'end', 'normal', 'people', 'sometimes', 'tend', 'take', 'abilities', 'granted', 'claiming', 'have', 'lot', 'knowledge', 'people', 'such', 'Mr', 'Dawson', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'have', 'far', 'more', 'abilities', 'normal', 'people', 'have', 'ability', 'truly', 'love', 'deep', 'struggle', 'attain', 'goals.If', 'such', 'movies', 'are', 'further', 'directed', 'truly', 'belive', 'will', 'learn', 'appreciate', 'abilities', 'rights', 'Mentally', 'Disabled']",I am Sam
