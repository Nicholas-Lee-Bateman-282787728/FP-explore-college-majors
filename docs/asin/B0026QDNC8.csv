Sumrall ""Al Sumrall""","[2, 2]","Although I have never been a Van Heflin fan (although he was perfect for his role in Shane),  he works in his historical role. It is not a Nazi apology movie, the fact is that the captain of the raider Atlantis was cut from a different cloth in that he pushed the envelope against his Nazi bosses to fight in a manner of a gentlemen.  Perhaps he was an outdated warrior, but he is one of the few German officers who actually earned their place in history as a gallant, honorable,  and quite effective foe who earned the respect of the Royal Navy.  The depiction of the Atlantis and her rather remarkable commerce raider cruise is far more accurate than most films. The only black mark of the film is a quite unnecessary T & A scenes when a  hot blond of the late 1950's who would look more in place in a 60's beach movie  is somehow showing her stuff (as much as she is allowed) in a 1941 time period.

1251976,A32T2H8150OJLU,B0026QDNC8,ARH,"[2, 2]","Van Heflin plays the captain of a German surface raider in this 1960 production of real life events that took place during WWII in 1940-1941.  The German captain (Heflin) is portrayed as a decent man who is doing his duty during a time of war.  He would, whenever possible, allow ships he attacked to stop and offload all passengers and crew before being sunk.  His overzealous first officer on the other hand does not see the value in wasting time energy and resources to do this, and put the ship at increased risk of detection.  Heflin nevertheless less proceeds by taking a minimum of life whenever possible.This particular ship flies under the flags of many nations as it stalks its prey.  Then when it is too late for the other ship to escape the German ensign is hoisted above what appears to be , hidden guns are exposed, and open fire.  The German ship jams the other ship's radio signals and destroys the radio mast.  Once this is done the Germans send a follow-up message stating that all is well, thus confusing the British Royal Navy which is trying its best to figure out what is sinking all of this shipping.  It is a submarine or a surface raider?Charles Laughton plays Adm. Russell of the Royal Navy, and it is responsibility to figure out what is going on.  This film was made toward the very end of his career and, to me at least, he had lost some of his panache.  Plus, to me Laughton will always be either Capt. Blight or Capt. Kidd...and seeing him in WWII Royal Navy uniform should not have been a surprised, but frankly I think he makes a better sailing ship captain than a desk admiral.All in all I was extremely impressed by the storyline...one I've heard of for years but only recently had a chance to watch.4 Solid stars!  I enjoyed it through and through.",4,A worthy sea tale...but to me Laughton will always make a better sailing ship captain than a desk admiral,1321833600,"11 21, 2011",2011,1784,"['Van', 'Heflin', 'captain', 'German', 'surface', 'raider', '1960', 'production', 'real', 'life', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'WWII', '1940-1941', 'German', 'captain', 'Heflin', 'portrayed', 'decent', 'man', 'who', 'doing', 'duty', 'time', 'war', 'would', 'whenever', 'possible', 'allow', 'ships', 'attacked', 'stop', 'offload', 'passengers', 'crew', 'being', 'sunk', 'overzealous', 'first', 'officer', 'other', 'hand', 'not', 'see', 'value', 'wasting', 'time', 'energy', 'resources', 'do', 'put', 'ship', 'increased', 'risk', 'detection', 'Heflin', 'nevertheless', 'less', 'proceeds', 'taking', 'minimum', 'life', 'whenever', 'possible.This', 'particular', 'ship', 'flies', 'flags', 'many', 'nations', 'prey', 'Then', 'when', 'too', 'late', 'other', 'ship', 'escape', 'German', 'ensign', 'hoisted', 'what', 'be', 'hidden', 'guns', 'are', 'exposed', 'open', 'fire', 'German', 'ship', 'other', 'ship', 'radio', 'signals', 'radio', 'mast', 'Once', 'done', 'Germans', 'send', 'follow-up', 'message', 'stating', 'well', 'thus', 'confusing', 'British', 'Royal', 'Navy', 'trying', 'best', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'sinking', 'shipping', 'submarine', 'surface', 'raider', 'Charles', 'Laughton', 'Adm.', 'Russell', 'Royal', 'Navy', 'responsibility', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'very', 'end', 'career', 'least', 'had', 'lost', 'panache', 'Laughton', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'either', 'Capt', 'Blight', 'Capt', 'Kidd', 'seeing', 'WWII', 'Royal', 'Navy', 'uniform', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'surprised', 'frankly', 'think', 'better', 'sailing', 'ship', 'captain', 'desk', 'admiral.All', 'was', 'extremely', 'impressed', 'storyline', 'one', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'years', 'only', 'recently', 'had', 'chance', 'watch.4', 'Solid', 'stars', 'enjoyed']",Under Ten Flags [Region 2]
1251977,A3Q4GQ7U51G9XO,B0026QDNC8,Dan Thompson,"[7, 7]","I like this movie.  It is based on true events and appears to not stray too far from the facts, even though there is some fictionalization and well used war movie themes are evident.  Still, the actions of the German surface raiders, especially armed merchantman like the Atlantis, are little known and ""Under Ten Flags"" does a good job of letting us see how they operated. Some viewers might wonder about the portrayal of the German captain as almost anti-Nazi and his efforts to wage a clean war with as few casualties as possible, but apparently that was indeed what happened.  The movie moves at a good pace with sufficient action to keep the tension going.  There are some anachronisms, like the too modern reconnaissance airplane, and movie making compromises, like a destroyer portraying a cruiser, but they do not really detract from the enjoyment of the film.Unfortunately, this DVD does not present the movie particularly well.  It is a pan and scan 4:3 version of a wide screen movie.  The image is washed out and not very sharp.  The audio is okay but only two channel.  So, this is far from even the average standards of what DVD can deliver.  But, even with its deficiencies, it is the only DVD of this movie available.  Hopefully, a DVD that does not have these faults will someday be available.  Until then, the movie is worth watching even on this DVD.",4,"Good movie, mediocre DVD",1264982400,"02 1, 2010",2010,1369,"['like', 'movie', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'not', 'stray', 'too', 'far', 'facts', 'even', 'fictionalization', 'well', 'used', 'war', 'movie', 'themes', 'are', 'evident', 'Still', 'actions', 'German', 'surface', 'raiders', 'especially', 'armed', 'merchantman', 'Atlantis', 'are', 'little', 'known', 'Ten', 'Flags', 'good', 'job', 'letting', 'see', 'how', 'operated', 'viewers', 'might', 'wonder', 'portrayal', 'German', 'captain', 'almost', 'anti-Nazi', 'efforts', 'wage', 'clean', 'war', 'few', 'casualties', 'possible', 'apparently', 'was', 'indeed', 'what', 'happened', 'movie', 'good', 'pace', 'sufficient', 'action', 'keep', 'tension', 'going', 'are', 'anachronisms', 'too', 'modern', 'reconnaissance', 'airplane', 'movie', 'making', 'compromises', 'destroyer', 'portraying', 'cruiser', 'do', 'not', 'really', 'detract', 'enjoyment', 'film.Unfortunately', 'DVD', 'not', 'present', 'movie', 'particularly', 'well', 'pan', 'scan', '4:3', 'version', 'wide', 'screen', 'movie', 'image', 'washed', 'out', 'not', 'very', 'sharp', 'audio', 'okay', 'only', 'two', 'channel', 'So', 'far', 'even', 'average', 'standards', 'what', 'DVD', 'can', 'deliver', 'even', 'deficiencies', 'only', 'DVD', 'movie', 'available', 'Hopefully', 'DVD', 'not', 'have', 'faults', 'will', 'someday', 'be', 'available', 'then', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'even', 'DVD']",Under Ten Flags [Region 2]

Bishop,"[3, 3]","This movie presents a less well known phase of the Second World War at sea -- German Navy commerce raiders preying on Allied merchant ships in the Indian Ocean and South Atlantic in 1940 and 1941.  The screenplay drew on the 602-day cruise of the German raider ""Atlantis"" and the Royal Navy's efforts to find, track, and destroy the vessel.  For more details, see Wikipedia's article on ""German auxiliary cruiser Atlantis."")Van Helflin played the German captain, modeled after Captain Bernhard Rogge, who tried to spare the lives of merchant crews and passengers as he sank the vessels.  Charles Laughton played the British admiral, though his portrayal edged toward a parody of his other roles.  Wartime film clips spliced into the movie have some anachronisms, and some other cutaways will distract aircraft and ship buffs.  The issues in morality and international law are treated, but lightly.
