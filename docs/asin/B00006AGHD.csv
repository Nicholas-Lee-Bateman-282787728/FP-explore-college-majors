709175,A73FVR5VRSO89,B00006AGHD,Abhijoy Gandhi,"[0, 4]","INSOMNIA/ USA 2002 (3.0 Stars)11 Jan 2004: The first scene from Insomnia, that of a two seater plane gliding over endless glaciers perhaps sets up the mise-en-scene of cold spaces and unexpected occurrences in alien lands. The rest of the film only builds on this growing sense of alienation even as British Director Christopher Nolan takes great care to build the entire film around one single occurrence. While I haven't seen the original Norwegian film of which this namesake is a remake, I can't imagine Scandinavian cinema to be quite so literal, aka Insomnia equals the protagonist never sleeps. My guess would be that Al Pacino's physical manifestation of what might have been a hugely meta-diagetic depiction in the original renders the two films as very different, albeit with a common storyline.The part I enjoyed the most was the mood that Nolan created through the clever use of texture. A harsh key light with an extra-ordinarily high lighting ratio played out the metaphor for the charred emotional feeling the central character, an upright detective (Pacino) is experiencing. This stylistic element in stark contrast to the polar blues of the Alaskan horizon (where the film is staged) aptly sets the stage for nervous expectation. The spoiler is that Detective Pacino accidentally shoots his partner where they are investigating the murder of a teenage girl in a small Alaskan town. Pacino, who works for the LAPD has a history of disagreement with his partner, and therefore feels compelled to keep the truth to himself. The catch is that the teenage-girl killer has been witness to this mishap.The killer turns out to be Robin Williams, who surfaces only in the latter part of the movie and whom we have all but forgotten about by now (the fact that he was even a part of this film). The exploration of the relationship between a conniving killer &amp; a seasoned detective with a dark secret leaves the film wanting in the end. Nolan, who so successfully explores Guy Pierce's amnesia in Memento fails on the encore. We are thus left with a film that continues to work on our sub conscience with its artistic mist in never-land, but one that is finally guilty of narrative triteness. Eminently watchable for the transfer of plight and mood, Pacino does a good if somewhat less intelligent job of portraying the hapless Detective, cursed to sleeplessness in a land where the sun ironically never sets.",3,Nolan holds back on key strengths in Norwegian remake,1075161600,"01 27, 2004",2004,2419,"['INSOMNIA/', 'USA', '2002', '3.0', 'Stars', '11', 'Jan', '2004', 'first', 'scene', 'Insomnia', 'two', 'seater', 'plane', 'gliding', 'endless', 'glaciers', 'perhaps', 'up', 'mise-en-scene', 'cold', 'spaces', 'unexpected', 'occurrences', 'alien', 'lands', 'rest', 'film', 'only', 'growing', 'sense', 'alienation', 'even', 'British', 'Director', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'great', 'care', 'build', 'entire', 'film', 'one', 'single', 'occurrence', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'original', 'Norwegian', 'film', 'namesake', 'remake', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'Scandinavian', 'cinema', 'be', 'quite', 'so', 'literal', 'aka', 'Insomnia', 'protagonist', 'never', 'guess', 'would', 'be', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'physical', 'manifestation', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'hugely', 'meta-diagetic', 'depiction', 'original', 'renders', 'two', 'films', 'very', 'different', 'common', 'storyline.The', 'part', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'was', 'mood', 'Nolan', 'created', 'clever', 'use', 'texture', 'harsh', 'key', 'light', 'extra-ordinarily', 'high', 'lighting', 'ratio', 'played', 'out', 'metaphor', 'charred', 'emotional', 'feeling', 'central', 'character', 'upright', 'detective', 'Pacino', 'experiencing', 'stylistic', 'element', 'stark', 'contrast', 'polar', 'blues', 'Alaskan', 'horizon', 'where', 'film', 'staged', 'aptly', 'stage', 'nervous', 'expectation', 'spoiler', 'Detective', 'Pacino', 'accidentally', 'shoots', 'partner', 'where', 'are', 'investigating', 'murder', 'teenage', 'girl', 'small', 'Alaskan', 'town', 'Pacino', 'who', 'LAPD', 'history', 'disagreement', 'partner', 'therefore', 'feels', 'compelled', 'keep', 'truth', 'catch', 'teenage-girl', 'killer', 'been', 'witness', 'mishap.The', 'killer', 'out', 'be', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'who', 'only', 'latter', 'part', 'movie', 'whom', 'have', 'forgotten', 'now', 'fact', 'was', 'even', 'part', 'film', 'exploration', 'relationship', 'conniving', 'killer', 'amp', 'seasoned', 'detective', 'dark', 'secret', 'film', 'wanting', 'end', 'Nolan', 'who', 'so', 'successfully', 'Guy', 'Pierce', 'amnesia', 'Memento', 'fails', 'encore', 'are', 'thus', 'left', 'film', 'work', 'sub', 'conscience', 'artistic', 'mist', 'never-land', 'one', 'finally', 'guilty', 'narrative', 'triteness', 'Eminently', 'watchable', 'transfer', 'plight', 'mood', 'Pacino', 'good', 'somewhat', 'less', 'intelligent', 'job', 'portraying', 'hapless', 'Detective', 'cursed', 'sleeplessness', 'land', 'where', 'sun', 'ironically', 'never', 'sets']",Insomnia Region 2

709177,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00006AGHD,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[0, 1]","When I saw this film in the theaters back in 2002, I was blown away.  I had seen Christopher Nolan's Memento, and couldn't wait for his follow-up film.  I was impressed by the eclectic range of characters from Hilary Swank, Al Pacino, and Robin Williams - a combination that I may have put money down prior to this film the group that would never share screen time together.  I was wrong.  I also was eagerly anticipating what Nolan would do with this film, having not seen the original when I went to the theater; I knew that he would bring us a compelling drama that would pull the best out of our cast.  I was not disappointed.  When this film was released, I immediately bought it, poured it into my collection of films, and watched it at least a dozen times since then.  I loved the combination of acting between Pacino and Williams because they had two completely different styles.  I thought Swank was decent, but contributed very little to the simpleton character she was to play - and I thought that Maura Tierney as the reclusive innkeeper was a great fit.  I loved the way that Nolan filmed it, the cinematography was excellent, and the music kept me on the edge of my seat until the very, clich&eacute; ending.  I was in awe of this film - that is - until I saw the original.  Now, I find myself questioning the value of this film and of Nolan's honesty to the original director's vision.  It nearly makes me tear up to see a great, valued independent foreign film get the slap of U.S.D.A. Hollywood on it with bigger budgets, bigger scripts, and an ending that seemed like it arrived directly from the ""How to build a great climax"" handbook handed to new ... mainstream directors.For those looking for a review of just this version of Insomnia, I want to initially say that watching this film on its own is good.  If you have not seen the original, then this is a great eye candy film with fantastic scenes that prove that Nolan can conquer his trade if given the opportunity (remember what he did with the Batman legacy), but together these films do not match up and fans of the original will scoff at Nolan's poor attempt to bring the honesty and directness that director Erik Skjoldbjrg superbly brought to the screen.  I understand that one, when making comments about Insomnia, should keep them separate, but there are so many disheartening differences between the two that I do not want others to purely watch this one with Pacino and Williams, but instead see the two and make their own assessments.  To begin, Pacino is no Stellan Skarsgrd (as odd as that may be to say), but Skarsgrd brings a character to the screen forcing us to follow the emotional level of the events, instead of Pacino's over-the-top reactions to situations.  While Skarsgrd brings intensity to the character due to events and his ""unknown"" past, Pacino brings a visual to the character.  You cannot seem to take your eyes off Pacino, but that is just him being the actor that he is.  There are elements left out of Nolan's interpretation that are key to truly giving us the ""bad cop"" mentality that we are supposed to have about Dormer.  Oddly, in the original, we are not supposed to find ourselves liking or feeling sympathy for Skarsgrd, but in this one we want to see Pacino come clean and rid himself of the guilt.  A big difference between the two films is the cross-referencing between Pacino and Skarsgrd, because by seeing each of these two bring something new to the table, we, as viewers, saw a completely different film.Outside of the characters, Nolan's indiscreet changes do morph this film into something completely different that originally conceived.  To call this film a remake would be tough in my eyes, because it is not a remake.  It is a new interpretation of a classic film.  Nolan makes some small changes to the plot which ultimately changes that course of our characters and the overall tones of the film.  For example, there is quite a bit more Hollywood ""running"" in Nolan's film than in the original.  Skarsgrd captures our attention because of his internal conflicts, while Nolan captures our attention in his film by forcing us to watch Pacino run Williams down, to see him screaming his lines at random characters, and the ending that just epitomizes the standard that Hollywood seems to embrace.  Without giving away too much detail, I must say that unlike the original, more gunfire is used, the intensity of the music is increased, and an event occurs with our main character that changes the original film completely.  That is why I cannot call this film a remake in any way shape or form.  This is an interpretation, albeit a very close interpretation, but not identical.  Nolan took chances, he changed the frame of the story, and gave us a pure 100% uncut slice of Hollywood that one could almost witness in any blockbuster released during the summer months.  It was pathetic and if I were the director of the original, Nolan's interpretation would have made me rather upset.Overall, I still like Nolan's work, and while I have lowered my enjoyment of this film after seeing this original, I must say that from 2002-present I thoroughly enjoyed Nolan's Insomnia.  So, where does that put us currently?  I would suggest this film to friends mainly because I am a sucker for Pacino's work (early and recent), and for some strange reason I cannot say ""no"" to a Robin Williams' film (even if this took place during his ""dark"" stint).  I also think that Nolan's craft is unmatched today, and while he will conform to Hollywood (i.e. Insomnia), he uses it to pay rent and finance his next films.  For that, I gotta respect him.  I will say this to friends as well, if you want to see a great film, one must see the original Insomnia and witness a truly disturbing character at his best.  Skarsgrd is on the top of his game with version, and Pacino could not compete.  To summarize, together these two films cannot compare because the original is 100% better (because they ARE two separate films), but apart Nolan does cloak a good story with great cinematography.  So, I would suggest it.

709178,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B00006AGHD,Alex Udvary,"[0, 0]","""Insomnia"" is an at times confusing puzzle by the same person who created the cult hit\ and perhaps even classic(?) film ""Memento"", Christopher Nolan.""Insomnia"" is a remake of an 1998 Norwegian film directed by Erik Skjoldbjaerg, and it's one of the few times we can say a remake actually works! This new version of ""Insomnia"" is so grandly conceieved, so richly constructed that I'm afraid American audiences won't like it. ""Insomnia"" is not some by the numbers, fast-paced, loud summer movie, that perhaps some people might think it will turn out to be, no, this movie is a well thought out character study about what happens when we make the wrong choices to protect ourselves. Director, Nolan is more concerned here with the story and character development then loud car chasing scenes, or big explosions. Nolan and screenwriter Hillary Seitz have actually taken the time out to tell us a story. They pace the film wonderfully and allow us to get to know the characters. There is more to a film like ""Insomnia"" than meets the eye. But, even so, like I said, I'm afraid the American public won't go for it. The American public likes fast, cliche, pointless, mindless movies. They like to see people run away from dinosaurs or people under attack by a group of aliens. I know for a fact people will say that this movie is slow and boring. And that it doesn't go anywhere. People will say this film is not a good follow-up to ""Memento"". But, they are wrong. They just have no patience.The plot for ""Insomnia"" goes something like this; Will Dormer (Al Pacino) and Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) are two L.A. cops sent to Alaska to investigate the murder of a teenage girl. Once they arrive they are greeted by Ellie Burr (Hillary Swank) who is a by the books, young cop. She's the cliche character who became a cop because she loves it. She thinks that there's no corruption inside the system. As the film goes on, we find out that it's not merely because Dormer (Pacino) and Eckhart (Donovan) are good cops that they have been sent to investigate this case. They were both in trouble in L.A. for some questionable actions on their last case. This is there way of taking the ""heat"" off them. As the film goes on we find out that the killer was\is a ""twisted"" person. He actually took the time out to wash the girl's hair, to paint her nails, and even clip them! It was not just a random act of violence, but a premeditated one. I don't really want to give much more information then I already have, you just have to go see the film yourself to find out the rest. All I will say is the film has a lot of ""tricks"" up it's sleeve, so don't think you'll be able to see through the plot.So, some of you are probably wondering, how is this different from the original, well, there are small differences. Like the whole background story with the lead character's being sent on the case. The relationship between the two cops is different. And, the female character in this one doesn't seem as strong. Also, there are some brief scenes of sexual content. Which does not appear in this new version.""Insomnia"" is one of the year's best films, it has a truly remarkable performance by Al Pacino. So far, it's the best performance of the year! Pacino proves himself to be one of the greatest actor we have around today. Robin Williams is oddly, very good in this film. I use the word oddly because I sometimes find it hard for me to see him in serious roles. I mean, this is the same man who use to play a space alien on ""Mork & Mindy"". But, Williams gives his best performance since ""Good Will Hunting"". Hilary Swank gives a good performance as well, but, for me, it wasn't anything really special, though, I don't think that was her fault, I think it was just the way the part was written.Bottom-Line: ""Insomnia"" is an extremely well constructed character study\thriller. The pacing of the film is wonderful and the performances are even better.

709179,A10WCSGF78M2KE,B00006AGHD,Alfonso A.,"[2, 4]","""Memento"" was a tough act to follow. Director Christopher Nolan's riveting 2001 film was a technically and thematically challenging cinematic tour de force.But that was just an art movie that became a sleeper hit. ""Insomnia,"" a shadowy, adroit murder mystery, is Nolan's introduction to the big leagues. It's a Hollywood movie with a Hollywood cast of Oscar winners: Al Pacino, Robin Williams and Hilary Swank.It even has a Hollywood ending. Or at least it feels that way. The big scene granted one of the stars in the last sceneat the end doesn't seem in synch with the moody hour and three-quarters that precede it, or the 1998 Norwegian film on which ""Insomnia"" is based. Somehow, you can't really see that kind of emotional punch-up coming from the Scandinavians.Otherwise, ""Insomnia"" is a deftly entertaining film, smartly played and smartly directed.Something's fishy in the small Alaskan town of Nightmute, which claims to be the ""Halibut Fishing Capital of the World."" A teenage girl has been beaten and murdered.Nightmute isn't the sort of place where people get murdered, brutally or not. So they call in the pros: Will Dormer (Pacino), a legend in the Los Angeles Police Department, and his partner, Hap (Martin Donovan). Though they're friends, there seems to be some tension between them. It might have something to do with the fact that Internal Affairs is investigating their department. Hap is ready to cooperate - which bothers Will, though he has a long-established reputation as a good cop. Then there's the local cop (Swank), who's helping them out; she has hero-worshipped Will since graduating from the police academy.Tracking down a killer is the sort of thing the L.A. guys are used to doing; what they can't handle is the relentless Alaskan summer, where it's light at 3 in the morning. Will is especially affected, to the point where he's raging against the non-dying of the light. By the end of the movie, he hasn't slept for six days. But is it the light or something else that's keeping him awake?Swank quotes the hero cop to himself: A good cop can't sleep because a piece of the puzzle is missing, and a bad cop can't sleep because of his conscience.Williams doesn't enter the picture until 30 minutes in, and by then you'll probably have some idea of where he fits in the scheme of things. He plays Walter Finch, a hack writer of obscure crime novels who's obsessed with cops. In this case, that means Will, which leads to some of the cleverest cat-and-mouse games in recent memory. Especially riveting is an interrogation scene in which each diabolically tops the other.Nightmute may be bathed in near 24/7 daylight, but most of ""Insomnia"" takes place in dark, claustrophobic rooms. When Nolan takes us outside, to show us a panoramic view of the Alaskan wilderness, we feel doubly cramped by the interior scenes. It's disorienting, and it's meant to be. The claustrophobia is brought to a near-hysterical level in a scene where Pacino and Williams chase each other across a log float and Pacino, terrifyingly, becomes trapped underwater, his arms getting crushed by the immense logs as he tries to claw his way back to air.Nolan and Pacino cannily convey the fallout of sleeplessness: the confusion, the heaviness, the bleariness. More importantly, except for a lapse or two, Pacino reins himself in. Instead of the bloated histrionics of ""Scent of a Woman,"" he gives the part the same careful character shadings he used in ""Donnie Brasco.""The real proof of Nolan's skill with actors, however, is Williams, who's been told incessantly that he needs to play against type. You can barely place that eerily familiar face, and his Mork-ish physical energy has been rechanneled into something jittery and unsettling.No, ""Insomnia"" isn't as good as ""Memento,"" but who really expected it to be? But it gives Nolan a chance to prove he can survive going Hollywood and still keep something of his distinctiveness from being erased. In a season full of summer-movie dumbness, ""Insomnia"" is a movie to seek out.",4,Sleepless In Alaska,1022803200,"05 31, 2002",2002,4034,"['Memento', 'was', 'tough', 'act', 'follow', 'Director', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'riveting', '2001', 'film', 'was', 'technically', 'thematically', 'challenging', 'cinematic', 'tour', 'de', 'force.But', 'was', 'just', 'art', 'movie', 'became', 'sleeper', 'hit', 'Insomnia', 'shadowy', 'adroit', 'murder', 'mystery', 'Nolan', 'introduction', 'big', 'leagues', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'Hollywood', 'cast', 'Oscar', 'winners', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Hilary', 'Swank.It', 'even', 'Hollywood', 'ending', 'least', 'way', 'big', 'scene', 'granted', 'one', 'stars', 'last', 'sceneat', 'end', ""n't"", 'seem', 'synch', 'moody', 'hour', 'three-quarters', 'precede', '1998', 'Norwegian', 'film', 'Insomnia', 'based', 'Somehow', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'kind', 'emotional', 'punch-up', 'coming', 'Scandinavians.Otherwise', 'Insomnia', 'deftly', 'entertaining', 'film', 'smartly', 'played', 'smartly', 'directed.Something', 'fishy', 'small', 'Alaskan', 'town', 'Nightmute', 'be', 'Halibut', 'Fishing', 'Capital', 'World', 'teenage', 'girl', 'been', 'beaten', 'murdered.Nightmute', ""n't"", 'sort', 'place', 'where', 'people', 'get', 'murdered', 'brutally', 'not', 'call', 'pros', 'Will', 'Dormer', 'Pacino', 'legend', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Police', 'Department', 'partner', 'Hap', 'Martin', 'Donovan', ""'re"", 'friends', 'be', 'tension', 'might', 'have', 'something', 'do', 'fact', 'Internal', 'Affairs', 'investigating', 'department', 'Hap', 'ready', 'cooperate', 'bothers', 'Will', 'long-established', 'reputation', 'good', 'cop', 'Then', 'local', 'cop', 'Swank', 'who', 'helping', 'out', 'hero-worshipped', 'Will', 'graduating', 'police', 'academy.Tracking', 'down', 'killer', 'sort', 'thing', 'L.A.', 'guys', 'are', 'used', 'doing', 'what', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'relentless', 'Alaskan', 'summer', 'where', 'light', '3', 'morning', 'Will', 'especially', 'affected', 'point', 'where', 'raging', 'non-dying', 'light', 'end', 'movie', ""n't"", 'slept', 'six', 'days', 'light', 'something', 'else', 'keeping', 'awake', 'Swank', 'hero', 'cop', 'good', 'cop', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sleep', 'piece', 'puzzle', 'missing', 'bad', 'cop', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sleep', 'conscience.Williams', ""n't"", 'enter', 'picture', '30', 'minutes', 'then', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'have', 'idea', 'where', 'scheme', 'things', 'Walter', 'Finch', 'hack', 'writer', 'obscure', 'crime', 'novels', 'who', 'obsessed', 'cops', 'case', 'Will', 'cleverest', 'cat-and-mouse', 'games', 'recent', 'memory', 'Especially', 'riveting', 'interrogation', 'scene', 'diabolically', 'other.Nightmute', 'may', 'be', 'bathed', 'near', '24/7', 'daylight', 'most', 'Insomnia', 'place', 'dark', 'claustrophobic', 'rooms', 'When', 'Nolan', 'outside', 'show', 'panoramic', 'view', 'Alaskan', 'wilderness', 'feel', 'doubly', 'cramped', 'interior', 'scenes', 'disorienting', 'meant', 'be', 'claustrophobia', 'brought', 'near-hysterical', 'level', 'scene', 'where', 'Pacino', 'Williams', 'chase', 'other', 'log', 'float', 'Pacino', 'terrifyingly', 'trapped', 'underwater', 'arms', 'getting', 'crushed', 'immense', 'logs', 'claw', 'way', 'back', 'air.Nolan', 'Pacino', 'cannily', 'fallout', 'sleeplessness', 'confusion', 'heaviness', 'bleariness', 'More', 'importantly', 'lapse', 'two', 'Pacino', 'Instead', 'bloated', 'histrionics', 'Scent', 'Woman', 'part', 'same', 'careful', 'character', 'shadings', 'used', 'Donnie', 'Brasco', 'real', 'proof', 'Nolan', 'skill', 'actors', 'however', 'Williams', 'who', 'been', 'told', 'incessantly', 'play', 'type', 'can', 'barely', 'place', 'eerily', 'familiar', 'face', 'Mork-ish', 'physical', 'energy', 'been', 'rechanneled', 'something', 'jittery', 'unsettling.No', 'Insomnia', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'Memento', 'who', 'really', 'expected', 'be', 'Nolan', 'chance', 'prove', 'can', 'survive', 'going', 'Hollywood', 'still', 'keep', 'something', 'distinctiveness', 'being', 'erased', 'season', 'full', 'summer-movie', 'dumbness', 'Insomnia', 'movie', 'seek', 'out']",Insomnia Region 2

However, Christopher Nolan (of Memento-fame) directed this, and so I decided to check it out.  I honestly don't know what this film got good reviews for.  (It was surprising to me that George Clooney and Steven Soderbergh even produced it.)  I found it depressing and slow.I've given up on Al Pacino a long time ago.  He looks old and tired.  His gruff voice and deepset eyes might've worked in the GodFather, but that was 20 years ago.  Hillary Swank plays the role of a rookie detective who's a great fan of Pacino's characater.  Along the way, she discovers he's not exactly what she thought he was.  In NightMute, Alaska where the sun never sets, Pacino is out looking for the killer of a teenage girl.  An accident, however, complicates his life and leads to his insomnia as well as a double-dealing with a certain writer (Robin Williams).  I was highly disappointed and bored.For those of you suffering from insomnia, this might just be the cure you've been looking for.LEAP rating (each out of 5):============================L (Language) - 3.5 (zzzz....)E (Erotica) - 0 (n/a)A (Action) - 2 (if you consider two gunshots in a foggy area, running across some logs, and a pointless shootout at the end action)P (Plot) - 3 (since the main point of the story is not who the killer is, plot degenerates pretty quickly)",2,"I haven't slept so well since... oh wait, in the theater.",1022457600,"05 27, 2002",2002,1432,"['film', 'remake', '1997', 'foreign', 'film', 'never', 'watched', 'original', 'had', 'nothing', 'compare', 'However', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'Memento-fame', 'directed', 'so', 'decided', 'check', 'out', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'film', 'got', 'good', 'reviews', 'was', 'surprising', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'even', 'produced', 'found', 'depressing', 'slow.I', ""'ve"", 'given', 'up', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'old', 'tired', 'gruff', 'voice', 'deepset', 'eyes', 'might', ""'ve"", 'worked', 'GodFather', 'was', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'Hillary', 'Swank', 'role', 'rookie', 'detective', 'who', 'great', 'fan', 'Pacino', 'characater', 'way', 'not', 'exactly', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'NightMute', 'Alaska', 'where', 'sun', 'never', 'sets', 'Pacino', 'out', 'looking', 'killer', 'teenage', 'girl', 'accident', 'however', 'life', 'insomnia', 'as', 'well', 'double-dealing', 'certain', 'writer', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'was', 'highly', 'disappointed', 'bored.For', 'suffering', 'insomnia', 'might', 'just', 'be', 'cure', ""'ve"", 'been', 'looking', 'for.LEAP', 'rating', '5', '============================L', 'Language', '3.5', 'zzzz', 'E', 'Erotica', '0', 'n/a', 'A', 'Action', '2', 'consider', 'two', 'gunshots', 'foggy', 'area', 'running', 'logs', 'pointless', 'shootout', 'end', 'action', 'P', 'Plot', '3', 'main', 'point', 'story', 'not', 'who', 'killer', 'plot', 'degenerates', 'pretty', 'quickly']",Insomnia Region 2
709181,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00006AGHD,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 6]","A follow up to the critical pleaser `Memento', `Insomnia' shows that Christopher Nolan isn't perfect.  In fact, this is the glitch in his fimography; a list of impressive feats that circle around an impressive re-imagining of Batman and some intriguing sci-fi ventures.  `Insomnia' has some superb moments, and facets of this film are truly strong, but overall there is a feeling of apathy that surrounds my concluding sentiments on the film itself.The idea here (of a LA cop lost in Alaskan daylight as he searches for a killer) has potential, and Nolan tries to uncover that potential, but it becomes too formulaic and predictable for its own good.  Instead of feeling lived in and exciting, most of the obvious `tricks' feel stagy and fake.  Swank proves that she cannot perform effectively without a gimmick, delivering a forgettable performance.  Pacino reigns in his usual theatrics, but he is less convincing than he needed to be.  Robin Williams gets under the skin with ease, and he festers.  He truly is the best thing about this film and definitely proves that he has more talent than many want to admit (he pigeonholes himself).I love Nolan (not as much as some, but far more than others).  He has a gift of imagery and he can capture moods with ease.  He does some good atmospheric work here (capturing unease in bright sunlight is hard to do), but at the end of the day, `Insomnia' is a little too mundane to make the desired impact.

His Pacino persona is a hand-in-glove fit for this sleep-deprived role.  Pacino being Pacino, I'll bet he took the Method approach and literally didn't sleep for 5+ days.  Either way, his frustration and increasingly slowed reflexes and perplexity are palpable.The real revelation for me was Robin Williams.  Even though he got an Oscar for 'Good Will Hunting,' I thought his fake Boston accent schtick there was dreadful.  Anyone who grew up within a 100-mile radius of Boston tuned him out the second he opened his mouth.Here, though, he's superb.  Forgot ""One Hour Photo.""

The location that took place &amp; shot in the Norwegian version, was a real town north of the Arctic Circle, where one can truly experience the 24-hour daylight...where as the American version was shot not too far from the mainland US border!  The US version of the movie took place supposedly in a small town in Alaska... Yet, one cannot really see the midnight sun or experience the true 24-hour daylight north or around the Arctic Circle..yet the movie took place around densely forested regions with towering granite peaks...doesn't sound too much like Northern Alaska to me.  The first second I looked at it reminded me more of B.C.'s natural surroundings or perhaps maybe some place in southern Alaska (which is far from the Arctic Circle) rather than the north.  Definately not as realistic.  And as I recall the name of the town they used in the movie...does exist in real life in AK, but was either abandoned or too tiny of a settlement that looked nothing like the one in the movie.  The town that was shot in the movie, is in real life a fair-sized town close to Vancouver...

Chris Nolan continues to perfect his skills as a filmaker, Al Pacino gives us another great performance, Robin Williams manages the near super-human task of suppressing his Robin Williamsness (i.e. manic comic genius),and gives a thoughtful and spot-on character performance, and Hillary Swank does nicely in a supporting role. The thriller is taut and complex and takes place in a new and interesting setting.Too bad there was an original movie of Insomnia, that takes place in Norway, that has much of the same elements but also some great differences. If one has seen both, the comparisons & contrasts are impossible to avoid. Al Pacino gives a terrific performance as the bleary-eyed sleepless detective, but Stellan Skarsgard in the Norwegian version is no slouch at acting either.I won't go into detail on the changes and diversions in both films. I recommend that movie buffs see both, as they are different films, despite sharing relatively the same story.I find the European version is more enigmatic, not drawn in bold black and whites, and with a feeling of life's quixotic accidents. The central crime/cover-up by the detective is motiveless in the Norwegian version, in the American film there is an added subtext that either deepens or makes simpler the detective's actions, depending upon your point of view. The byplay between the murderer and the detective is more complex in the American, and more subtle and less defined in the European. Pacino is a man with troubles, Skarsgard is a troubled man.But finally, the big difference is in the ending. I was disappointed that the American version opted to end everything in a typically American fashion, with a bullet, and all strands wrapped up in a bow. The American film is inexorable and predestined, the Norwegian film more open to happenstance and accident. The European version leaves the end enigmatically unresolved. I won't say which is best.

During this particular time of the year, the sun never sets.  The feeling of not belonging and the theme of constant light are very important in the film.As Dormer investigates the case, we become aware that _he_ is being investigated by Internal Affairs back in L.A.  As the events play out on the screen, Dormer finds that he and the killer he's looking for may have some things in common, which makes for some great dramatic moments and creates some wonderful tension...Watch 'Insomnia' for what it is:  a really, really good thriller with top-notch acting.Without giving the story away, I can tell you it has one hole, and it's a pretty big one.  If you can excuse it, you'll have a great time with 'Insomnia.'

But don't expect ""whodunnit"" to be the main issue; that is disclosed fairly early on. It's more who is going to find out, what are going to be the consequences, and how are the various characters going to get themselves out of the fine mess they've gotten into.Al Pacino play Detective Will Dormer, invited to a small town in northern Alaska to help with a murder and also to get him out of LA, where an Internal Affairs investigation is cooking. His partner Hap is with him, and explains that he is going to have to make a deal with IA to save his own skin and protect his family. He says Dormer won't be dragged into the mess, but Dormer insists he will be. (We find out later why.)Dormer and Hap are met by an attractive young female local detective who is to work with them. She's smart, and she idolizes Dormer. She did her case study at the academy on one of his most famous cases. The local police chief is a friend of Dormer's, and it was undoubtedly he who asked for Dormer to come and assist.The case is the brutal murder of an 18-yea-old girl whose body was found naked in the garbage dump. Dormer immediately notices some unusual features about the body, and finds some useful evidence at the girl's home. (Nah, not going to tell you what.) He and the local cops interview the girl's boyfriend, but Dormer is convinced he was not the killer. (Not going to tell you why, either.)The primary suspect turns out to be a mystery writer who lives about 15 miles away (Robin Williams) who has befriended the girl because she wanted to be a writer, and because she needed someone to talk to. He's very smooth, this one; after all he's a writer of murder mysteries, and knows how police operate.The title refers to the fact that it is high summer, and the sun basically never goes down. Dormer can't sleep, and he is tormented by, among other things, phone calls from the writer in the wee small hours of the morning because he can't sleep either. Eventually, Dormer is so in need of sleep that he's going really nuts. Practically gets himself killed falling asleep while driving, and eventually begins having hallucinations. He's determined to crack the case before he cracks up, and he does.

The script, too, is uneven, given the fascinating premise of a highly regarded but somewhat unconventional big-city detective and a somewhat disreputable character at that, (played well by Pacino) brought into the backwaters of remote Alaska to help solve a grisly and unsettling murder of a young and attractively seductive co-ed. From the outset, Pacino's character is wracked with insomnia which seems to be a result of both his own haunted past and the strange environment he now finds himself surrounded by.Very early on, the detective and his partner discover someone suspicious revisiting the crime scene, and in pursuit Pacino makes a fateful mistake that dials up the tension level and sets the stage for the insidious cat and mouse game that ensues between the pursued killer (Williams, in an over-the top performance that provides a pulse-raising coda to the progression of events) on the one hand, and the haunted and increasingly confused and bewildered Pacino, on the other. What results from this deadly conflict is a nightmare on steroids, a film noire shot in stark and bold Technicolor shades and hues.The supporting cast, including Hilary Swank doing a nice turn as an overly earnest young Alaskan policewoman, veteran Paul Dooley, and relative new-comer Martin Donovan, all help to promote the suffocating sense of a claustrophobic whirl of events gone tragically out of control. Not for the squeamish, I fear, but great entertainment for someone willing to see Pacino in yet another portrayal of a cop over the edge, and the surprisingly deadly Robin Williams as a most worthy opponent for the cop's relentless efforts to pursue him.

A few years back it was hip to remake French films, then it was film versions of old TV shows, and every year there seems to be a ""Sequelitis"" epidemic in multiplexes worldwide. But INSOMNIA offers a Hollywood rarity: This is a remake of a NORWEGIAN movie.While my opening comments don't offer much hope for the film, INSOMNIA is actually a great movie once you get into it. Starring Oscar winners Al Pacino, Robin Williams and Hilary Swank, executive produced by Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney and directed by Christopher Nolan director of the vastly overrated MEMENTO, INSOMNIA is a compelling mystery thriller.When cop Will Dormer (Pacino) witnesses the murder of his partner, the prime suspect is mystery writer Walter Finch (Williams). But while Finch appears accommodating to the police, chronic insomniac Dormer finds himself receiving taunting calls from Finch in the middle of the night. Dormer's investigation leads him to a remote Alaskan town which never sees nightfall during the spring/summer seasons where he is partnered with local cop Ellie Burr (Hillary Swank). But with the combination of the continued threats from his unseen nemesis and the stress of the investigation, Dormer's sleeping disorder is wearing him down and disorientating him, making him an easier target.Like MEMENTO, INSOMNIA is full of twists and is beautifully photographed. But thankfully unlike it, INSOMNIA has a plot that makes sense and keeps the viewer glued to the screen; but it is the strong characterisations by Pacino and Williams that make their cat-and-mouse game utterly compelling.

The plot kind of relies a bit heavy on too many film-noir/corrupt cop conventions, but it still makes those cliches seem fresh.  It is also interesting to see how both Pacino's and Williams' characters begin their path to ruin by rationalizing their deeds as being done for the greater good, but end up trapped in a lie after lie.

Al Pacino (The Godfather 1 and 2, Scarface, Heat, etc.) is LA homicide detective Will Dormer, sent to Nightmute, Alaska to investigate a murder. Will has a lot of professional / personal baggage that complicates matters, causing him to hide his own secrets while trying to solve the crime. Add to this the fact that he's arrived in northern Alaska during it's season of perpetual daylight, and he's got major sleeping problems as well! Between the murder case, the eternal daylight, and Will's own conscience, he quickly becomes a mess! It's amazing that he can still function at all, let alone, well. Hilary Swank (The Gift, 11:14) is a young officer who assists Dormer, only to find her own loyalties and sense of justice challenged. Robin Williams (One Hour Photo, The Night Listener) plays a seemingly mild-mannered sociopath whose one frantic desire is to cover / save his own a$$!

The town is in a part of the world where daylight lasts for six months, and Pacino's trouble sleeping slowly begins to drive him mad.Featuring wonderful performances from Hilary Swank (""Boys Don't Cry""), Maura Tierny (TV's ""ER"") and the incredible Robin Williams (""Good Will Hunting""), this movie is not the mystery one would expect. You know from the outset that Williams is the killer, and the drama comes from Pachino's struggle to capture him, especially after his exhaustion causes him to make an unspeakable mistake. Williams is best known as a comedian, but when he takes on dramatic roles like this, you get to see how good an actor he really is.Director Christopher Nolan (""Memento"") is becoming the master of a new breed of movies that aren't quite film noir but have enough in common with that genre to compare. And favorably, too. As in ""Memento"" he uses the trick of showing you only pieces of the puzzle in an odd order right up until the end, where it all comes together. Nolan has earned a spot on my slim list of filmmakers I'll give my theater admission price to no matter what.I'm glad Warner Bros actually gave us both a fullscreen AND a widescreen edition, rather than just a fullscreen like some studios have opted for lately... but I still don't get why anyone would watch fullscreen in this day and age.

Unaccustomed to the perpetual daylight in that part of the world, he is unable to sleep. His mental state begins to deteriorate and he finds himself drawn deeper and deeper into a web of his own making. As he is manipulated by the killer, he's forced to wonder if the two men have more than a little in common.Al Pacino, in the lead role, is a joy to watch as usual. I always find myself enjoying his performances, even in substandard films (which this isn't.) Robin Williams is surprisingly good; perhaps dramatic roles are his true calling (I've never found him funny.) Hilary Swank plays the local rookie who is teamed with Pacino's veteran character. Katharine Isabelle (GINGER SNAPS) appears in a smaller but significant role as the murdered girl's best friend.  And one can't talk about this film without mentioning the beautiful location, which the director and cinematographer take full advantage of.This isn't your typical ""police stalking a killer"" story.  We find out fairly early who the murderer is, and the protagonist even meets him face-to-face.  But the action is more about the protagonist himself, and the issues surrounding him.  Though there is information that is not revealed until the end, it is more a psychological drama than a murder mystery.The DVD contains a wealth of special features, including a technically-oriented director commentary (presented in shooting order), and select scene commentary from Swank and assorted production personnel. There is also a casual conversation between director Christopher Nolan and Pacino, and some behind the scenes featurettes. The most unusual is a short production featuring interviews with real life insomniacs as well as medical professionals.INSOMNIA is a worthy follow-up to MEMENTO.

I saw the foreign film upon which this was based and, unusually, this is the better film.  (Usually American remakes of foreign films are total schlock but that is not true here.)  It has some key ingredients for achieving this though.  First off, a first rate script that no one has ""Hollywoodized."" Secondly, letting Al Pacino and Robin Williams loose with their talents on first rate material and, in Williams' case, against his usual type, was sheer genius.  The two are absolutely superb together.  Pacino is the anti-hero cop who investigates a murder case in Alaska while trying to cope with a partner (Martin Donovan) who is going to turn state's evidence against him when they return to LA.  Not only will this ruin his career but it might also release all the murderers Pacino's character put away in prison. The partners are trying to track down the villain, Williams.  Surprisingly though, instead of running, Williams' villain comes forward and plays with Pacino's character, preying upon his weaknesses.  Pacino is further handicapped by not being able to get any sleep because of a variety of factors but not the least of which is that he's not used to sunlight 24/7 which occurs in Alaska in the warmer weather.

709209,A2PBV1899CX3TE,B00006AGHD,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[1, 4]","Insomnia was Christopher Nolan's next film after Memento. He is moving up the ladder to the next level, with big name actors--Al Pacino, Robin Williams, and Hillary Swank. Not quite up to block buster status with The Dark Knight or Inception, but he is a rising star. Insomnia was a remake of the 1997 Insomnia by Norwegian director Erik Skjoldbjrg.Instead of Norway, the remake is set in Alaska, so far North that the sun doesn't set for months. This wrecks havoc on the sleep cycles of Detective Will Dormer (Al Pacino), an LA cop who arrives to help with the investigation of the murder of a young woman. Besides the Midnight Sun, there is something else troubling the detective's sleep. Like MacBeth, he thinks that ""sleep should knit the raveled sleeve of care"" but sleep is no more. MacBeth, and Dormer, have murdered sleep. Dormer is under investigation by Internal Affairs for possibly fabricating evidence. As he tries to cover his tracks, he gets in deeper trouble.Rookie Detective Ellie Burr (Hillary Swank) looks up to Dormer, who she has studied in Detective School. She quotes from his text books, and is anxious to learn what she can from the man himself:-----------------------Dormer: You shouldn't knock misdemeanors.Det. Ellie Burr: Oh, but it's small stuff. It gets so boring.Dormer: It's all about small stuff. You know, small lies, small mistakes. People give themselves away, same in misdemeanors as they do on murder cases. It's just human nature. Aren't you gonna write that down?====================When this situation arrives in a film there is an interesting sub text, and that is that the young actor is playing a character who is learning from the more experienced character, and at the same time taking an acting class. This happened in The Color of Money where Tom Cruise played a pool hustler being schooled by Fast Eddie, played by Paul Newman. Al Pacino takes Swank to school, and really gives an amazing performance. Robin Williams also gets a chance to stretch his acting chops playing the enigmatic suspect, Finch. Swank is a quick learner, and her performance is solid.-----------------------Dormer: We better find out where this came from.Det. Ellie Burr: I tried. Mrs. Connell doesn't know, her friends didn't know.Dormer: Have you tried the jewelry stores? Small things, remember? The second you're about to dismiss something, think about it. Look at it again.Det. Ellie Burr: Want me to write that down?Dormer: No, I'll remember it.====================Director Christopher Nolan is also going to film school, but he is a quick learner, too. This film presented some interesting challenges. First and foremost, how do you depict insomnia without providing a cure for insomnia? Without putting the audience to sleep? The far North setting was beautiful, but all that white snow could be monotonous. Scenes in the fog were good at creating an atmosphere where the lines between right and wrong were blurred, but it could also lull you into a trance. The film was a murder mystery, but it was less concerned with finding who did it then it was with exploring moral dilemmas. The ways in which the detective and the killer were similar. If you do something wrong for the right reasons, does that make it OK? What happens once you cross that line...-----------------------Dormer: This guy crossed the line and didn't even blink.====================I don't see you blinking either, Detective. Maura Tierney plays the Detective's landlady, Rachel Clement. She has an interesting take on moral dilemmas, too.-----------------------Rachel Clement: I can't judge. There are two kinds of people in Alaska: those who were born here and those who come here to escape something. I wasn't born here.====================I wish this character could have been developed a little more. Just what it was she was escaping was never resolved.The Bottom Line is that Insomnia is a solid effort by Christopher Nolan on his way to bigger and better things. I would preferr to just watch the original--besides I heard that it was darker, and some of the changes kind of watered it down. In the original his interrogation techniques are much harsher, and instead of firing his gun in a dead dog to fabricate some evidence, he kills a dog. Great performances by Swank, Pacino, and Williams, in a setting that makes a good metaphor for the grey area between wake and sleep, and right and wrong. Like Detective Ellie Burr we are left with a question:-----------------------Det. Ellie Burr: Why?Dormer: Don't lose your way.====================Memento(2000) Directed by Christopher NolanScent of a Woman(1992) Al Pacino was Lieutenant Colonel Frank SladeGlengarry Glen Ross(1992)

709212,A3E8BTA2SXPV3P,B00006AGHD,cinemagirl,"[1, 2]","A remake, as Hollywood has proven to us time and time again, is a bad idea, especially if the original was just fine the way it was. This is why the task of turning the critically acclaimed Scandinavian original into an American film starring three Oscar-winning actors is not as easy as it seems. However, the film's in good hands; Chris Nolan, the amazingly talented director who gave us the headache-inducing (but in a good way) &quot;Memento,&quot; knows how to craft a good film without playing down to the audience.What made the original so good was its cinematography. The camera was a character; like a fallible narrator, angles could not be trusted; you had to second guess every frame. The cold Scandinavian landscape was the perfect setting for a film which delved into a crime, but also into the mind of the one investigating it. I was afraid the subtle nuances of the film would be lost in the American version: the telling gaze, the sun through the curtains, the metaphor of the fog. But, thankfully, Nolan kept most of the elements in his version, particularly the cinematic trope of the penetrating gaze (as a voyeuristic tool).For those who are more used to multiple action scenes, you might be disappointed. There's quite a bit of dialogue, the events aren't explicitly stated all the time, and the audience has to, in a way, participate in the film. However, the performances are top notch. Robin Williams, whom we all know as the silly funny man, has managed to master the art of subtlety. His tone, facial expressions, and eyes convey more than can be expressed with words. Al Pacino, a little older than Stellan Skarsgrd, the actor who plays the protagonist in the original, pulls off a fine performance alongside Swank.One disappointing element is the ending. Keeping in mind this is an American film, Nolan opted for the conventional everything-will-be-tied-up-explictly ending, which seems forced, especially when you consider the subtlety that informs the rest of the film. But this is still a fine film that is miles ahead of many other thrillers that Hollywood is churning out.

Utilizing his adept understanding of the human psyche, he creates a film that is both haunting and suspenseful. Though it may not keep you lying awake at night, Insomnia will surely keep you on the edge of your seat.When Detective Will Dormer and his partner, Hap Eckhart are asked to leave behind their native city of Los Angeles to help solve a murder case in a small Alaskan town, they have no idea of the dangers that await them. While in pursuit of a possible suspect Will accidentally shoots and kills Hap, having mistaken him for the suspect. But was it really an accident? Back in L.A. Hap was being asked to testify against Will, who had been using some unorthodox and illegal methods to serve justice. Will reluctantly covers up his role in Hap's death so as to avoid suspicion as to whether or not the shooting was intentional. Now Will is consumed by guilt and is unable to sleep. His insomnia grows more intense, and as he's in part of Alaska where the sun doesn't set for months, he blames his sleepless condition on the light. Yet there are two people who know what's really keeping him awake at night. Ellie Burr, a young and intelligent Alaskan detective, begins to see that Will is clearly disturbed by something and she is compelled to find out what. Meanwhile a strange, reclusive pulp novelist named Walter Finch begins calling Will. Finch says that he witnessed Hap's death at Will's hands, but he won't tell the authorities so long as Will agrees to help him in return. What presents a problem is the fact that Walter Finch is the very murder suspect that Will was pursuing when the accidental shooting occurred. And there can be no denial that Walter Finch is a killer. The two men find themselves forced to work together to conceal their mutual guilt, but when Detective Ellie Burr starts to uncover the truth, Will is faced with a moral dilemma. Shall he admit his faults, lose his job, and suffer the legal ramifications for what happened in L.A. and for what happened to Hap... or shall he choose to align himself with sociopathic Walter Finch in order to save himself? And what of Ellie Burr, whose youthful enthusiasm and integrity Will has come to respect and admire? Can he protect her from the truth that incriminates him and will inevitably lead her to Walter?Abandoning the complex narrative structure of his previous film Memento for a more straightforward storytelling style, Nolan manages to maintain a high level of suspense. He also uses numerous visual tricks to keep viewers interested in the conflicts of the characters. As Will Dormer becomes more exhausted the lights become brighter, things seem to move about him without reason, and he begins to experience hallucinations and extreme confusion. What is so remarkable is that, through all of this the viewer is able to follow the sequence of events and differentiate between reality and illusion.The cast features Al Pacino as Detective Will Dormer, Robin Williams as Walter Finch, and Hilary Swank as Detective Ellie Burr. Not a member of the cast gives a bad performance and each of them manage to hold their own, which is a feat in itself. Hilary Swank, in particular, is great as the young idealistic Ellie Burr. Also adding an unforgettable presence to the film is Robin Williams who creates a truly frightening villain, and yet at the same time he's so charismatic that you almost sympathize with him.

The Alaskan summer, with light 24 hours of day, can do that to visitorsRobin Williams, meanwhile, plays a killer. It's funny how comedians can do so well playing dramatic roles and Williams is a prime example.

Mind you I say this without having watched ""Death To Smootchy"" yet. However, this, and ""One Hour Photo"" are definitely his finest hours. This is a complex movie, and I have to thank my wife for suggesting we go see this on our 1st anniversary. It's about a murder in Alaska that the locals can't seem to solve, and they bring in a legendary police officer from Los Angeles played equally good by Al Pacino. However, Pacino's character isn't quite ready for the wilds of Alaska...especially during the summer when the sun never sets, and lack of sleep is an understatement. Then there comes the chase in the fog where Pacino accidently shoots his partner....or does he? There's alot more riding on this than the murder mystery itself, and it plays out where Williams and Pacino play the game of cat and mouse. Apparently Williams had done some research into Pacino's past, and he promises to keep quiet if Pacino keeps quiet about Williams little murder. There's a underlying twist here, and Pacino's admirer played by Hillary Swank comes to the same conclusion, and just in time when Pacino decides he doesn't want to keep quiet anymore, and then comes the fight scenes between Williams and Pacino, and brother let me tell you it was one that has stuck in my mind for the last 7 years. In the end however, it was hard to tell if justice was served as both Pacino and Williams characters end up dying by the others hand. I feel that this was one of the overlooked movies of 2002, and so I want to put this here to remind people that Robin Williams can act in suspense/thrillers too.

On that count, Insomnia is a success: The film works on all of the same levels as the original.....but it just didn't involve me in the same way.The story is pretty straightforward: Two L.A. Cops are brought to Alaska, ostensibly to help solve a murder, but the reality is they were sent away to get them out of the spotlight of an Internal Affairs investigation that could drag them both down. While trying to snare the killer, the stakeout goes horribly awry, and cop and killer become drawn together by the secret knowledge of what happened.The performances are great. Al Pacino, Robin Williams, Hilary Swank, and Nicky Katt are all great actors. The problem is, the story just doesn't seem compelling enough on it's own. The actors are the only thing sustaining interest. It's also riddled with bad-tv cliches: Evidence is found by accident, days after dozens of people turned the beach upside-down and found nothing, the killer opens a drawer in his house, allowing a cop to see evidence that can implicate him (oops!), Pacino even gets the location of Williams' hideout from the jacket of a book he'd written!

If at any moment in your life, you've been blessed to experience such a rare and precious love, you will be enamored with Moulin Rouge.At the turn of the century, the elite in-crowd gathers to socialize with the creatures of the seedy underworld and the Bohemian lifestyle at the legendary Parisian hot spot, the Moulin Rouge. Satine (Nicole Kidman) is known as the ""Sparkling Diamond"" for her dazzling beauty and immense talent as a courtesan. When Christian (Ewan McGregor), a young and talented writer, falls in love with her, she realizes he will be bad for business. A deal is made between the Moulin Rouge's owner, Harold Sidler (Jim Broadbent) and the Duke (Richard Roxburgh), to transform the club into a theater and put on a show, Spectacular Spectacular. In order to close the deal, Christian comes up with a bizarre story off the top of his head and the ensemble cast follows along with it. As the final piece, Satine must exclusively belong to the Duke, a slimy character with evil intentions.While Sidler agrees, it is already too late as Satine has fallen in love with Christian. They are careful to hide their torrid love affair, but it becomes evident to everyone except the Duke who's as sharp as a sack of wet mice. Lushly directed by Baz Luhrmann, this post-modern twist on the musical uses extreme photography techniques, vibrant colors and costumes, and visionary dream sequences to tell the story through song. Academy awards were presented to Catherine Martin for both Costume Design and Art Direction.The magic of falling in love is captured so perfectly in the setting and musical numbers that you are swept away with the overwhelming desire to go fall in love. Kidman and McGregor pour themselves into these musical numbers and sing with the emotions of a thousand magical dreams. It almost feels like you are in a fairy tale. Original songs, ""I'll fly away"" and ""Come what may,"" easily rival any memorable show tunes, but what really sells them are the voices of Kidman and especially McGregor. As Christian, McGregor gives all an artist possibly could to portray the young writer who is captivated by the gorgeous Satine. You truly believe and feel every emotion he experiences on screen just by looking in his eyes. It feels like you are looking into his soul.Kidman is marvelous as the famed courtesan who is dying, but doesn't know it. She is the consumate performer and as the number goes, ""the show must go on."" She won the Golden Globe for her performance in this role and was nominated for an Academy Award. Among the dazzling music, vibrant scenery and captivating performances, this tale teaches us ""the greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return.""",5,Insomnia,1120521600,"07 5, 2005",2005,2795,"['Love', 'oxygen', 'Love', 'lifts', 'up', 'where', 'belong', 'need', 'love', 'moment', 'life', ""'ve"", 'been', 'blessed', 'experience', 'rare', 'precious', 'love', 'will', 'be', 'enamored', 'Moulin', 'Rouge.At', 'turn', 'century', 'elite', 'in-crowd', 'gathers', 'socialize', 'creatures', 'seedy', 'underworld', 'Bohemian', 'lifestyle', 'legendary', 'Parisian', 'hot', 'spot', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'Satine', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'known', 'Sparkling', 'Diamond', 'dazzling', 'beauty', 'immense', 'talent', 'courtesan', 'When', 'Christian', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'young', 'talented', 'writer', 'love', 'will', 'be', 'bad', 'business', 'deal', 'made', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'owner', 'Harold', 'Sidler', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'Duke', 'Richard', 'Roxburgh', 'transform', 'club', 'theater', 'put', 'show', 'Spectacular', 'Spectacular', 'order', 'close', 'deal', 'Christian', 'up', 'bizarre', 'story', 'top', 'head', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'along', 'final', 'piece', 'Satine', 'must', 'exclusively', 'belong', 'Duke', 'slimy', 'character', 'evil', 'intentions.While', 'Sidler', 'already', 'too', 'late', 'Satine', 'fallen', 'love', 'Christian', 'are', 'careful', 'hide', 'torrid', 'love', 'affair', 'evident', 'everyone', 'Duke', 'who', 'as', 'sharp', 'sack', 'wet', 'mice', 'Lushly', 'directed', 'Baz', 'Luhrmann', 'post-modern', 'twist', 'musical', 'uses', 'extreme', 'photography', 'techniques', 'vibrant', 'colors', 'costumes', 'visionary', 'dream', 'sequences', 'tell', 'story', 'song', 'Academy', 'awards', 'were', 'presented', 'Catherine', 'Martin', 'Costume', 'Design', 'Art', 'Direction.The', 'magic', 'falling', 'love', 'captured', 'so', 'perfectly', 'setting', 'musical', 'numbers', 'are', 'swept', 'away', 'overwhelming', 'desire', 'go', 'fall', 'love', 'Kidman', 'McGregor', 'pour', 'musical', 'numbers', 'sing', 'emotions', 'thousand', 'magical', 'dreams', 'almost', 'feels', 'are', 'fairy', 'tale', 'Original', 'songs', ""'ll"", 'fly', 'away', 'Come', 'what', 'may', 'easily', 'memorable', 'show', 'tunes', 'what', 'really', 'are', 'voices', 'Kidman', 'especially', 'McGregor', 'Christian', 'McGregor', 'artist', 'possibly', 'could', 'portray', 'young', 'writer', 'who', 'captivated', 'gorgeous', 'Satine', 'truly', 'believe', 'feel', 'emotion', 'screen', 'just', 'looking', 'eyes', 'are', 'looking', 'soul.Kidman', 'marvelous', 'famed', 'courtesan', 'who', 'dying', ""n't"", 'know', 'consumate', 'performer', 'number', 'show', 'must', 'go', 'won', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'performance', 'role', 'was', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Award', 'dazzling', 'music', 'vibrant', 'scenery', 'captivating', 'performances', 'tale', 'greatest', 'thing', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'learn', 'just', 'love', 'be', 'loved', 'return']",Insomnia Region 2

This left Pacino blinking his eyes and doing his best drunken performance.  Why not let the glare of the sun flood the camera?

709223,AIMGHPI1AGVRF,B00006AGHD,Davewise,"[0, 0]","While this isn't the sort of thriller which will keep you on the edge or your seat, it will keep your interest throughout. Nolan does a great job directing, as usual, and it has a very talented cast, lead by Al Pacino, Hilary Swank, and Robin Williams. Williams does a very good job in a rare dramatic and creepy part. There's no element of his more well-known comedic side here at all. With a few well-placed twists, the movie will keep you guessing.LA detective Dormer (Pacino) is sent with his partner Eckhart to a small town in Alaska, in part to get away from an evolving investigation into their department and, more officially, to help with a homicide investigation. The little town of Nightmute isn't used to homicides, so when Dormer arrives to help, young officer Burr (Swank), who looks up to Dormer, is thankful for his help. None of the local officers are aware of the LA internal affairs investigation, but it's the main thing on the minds of Eckhart, who has decided he will testify, and Dormer, who is afraid of being ruined because of his action in a previous homicide case. Dormer is unable to sleep - partly because of the constant Alaskan sunlight and partly due to feelings of guilt - and this visibly wears on him. Before long Dormer identifies and lcoates the girl's killer, Finch, a police mystery writer, but things are far from over. Finch recognizes Dormer's weakened condition and has something on him. When Finch hatches a plan that would help them both get off free, Dormer has to choose either to play along or to try to outsmart him. Can he get justice for the murdered girl without implicating himself in other matters?The Alaskan scenery throughout the movie is both picturesque and somehow oppressive.

That's not to say that ""Insomnia"" is an average murder mystery- there's plenty of unconvential moods in the story.  Taking place in Alaska, Detective Dormer (Al Pacino) is called up from L.A. to help in a case about the murder of a teenage girl.  That's already been said, and really, that's about all the plot that you should give away, but I can say that its much less a mystery as it is a construction of it, and that's what keeps the movie interesting.  Al Pacino gives his best performance in years, playing his roll as a torn-apart cop dealing with insomnia (hence the title) in Alaska's 24-hour daylight.  He doesn't underplay his role, and puts the right amount of emotion into his character's setting.  If there was one thing to crtisize about ""Memento,"" it was that often times it seemed cold and numb- you couldn't really connect to the characters.  That is gone in ""Insomnia,"" and both Al Pacino and Robin Williams both deliver the goods.  Williams once again flexes his ability to be more than a slap-happy comedic actor (as we've seen in ""Dead Poets' Society"" and ""Good Will Hunting"").  He's perfectly spooky as the disturbed, supposed killer.  Hillary Swank and Nicky Katt also deliver notable performances.

It's almost impossible (for me) to not like a Pacino picture.  He's great in just about everything. And this is no exception.The DVD's commentary tracks are rather unique. Director Nolan takes us through the film chronologically, in the order in which it was filmed, starting with Day 1 (which is Scene #111!).The other commentaries are scene specific, which I like much better than having to watch the entire movie a second time just for the commentaries, which are oft times filled with silence.

709232,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B00006AGHD,Dennis Littrell,"[3, 4]","This finely wrought remake of the Norwegian film of the same name (1997)--an excellent film by the way--is something close to a thriller masterpiece flawed only by a too-hurried resolution.  Christopher Nolan, whose strikingly original Memento (2000) is among the best films made in recent years, planned this out very carefully, tying up most of the loose ends without relying on any phony motivation, which we sometimes see in passionate cop dramas.  However, the guns blazing at the end was a cheap way out of this psychologically complicated story.  Still, I think we can overlook that small fault since the rest of the film is so very well done.The incomparable Al Pacino gives a mesmerizing performance as Los Angeles police detective Will Dormer who is sent with his partner north to Alaska ostensibly to help in a murder investigation.  However we quickly learn that being out of town may help him and his partner avoid an Internal Affairs investigation to which Dormer may be vulnerable.  By the way, ""dormir"" in French means ""to sleep,"" which is something Dormer does not do for six days, which is very close to the edge of human tolerance.  Indeed Dormer's last line in the film is ""Just let me sleep.""Pacino is supported by Robin Williams as Walter Finch, a morally-deranged mystery writer who doesn't appear until the film is about half over.  He makes up for keeping us waiting with a dramatic performance that will curl your toes.  He is even more despicable than Bjorn Floberg was in the Norwegian film.  Not only is Robin Williams's appearance subtly altered and his demeanor strange, even his voice is not the same.  He is a long way from Good Morning, Vietnam (1987) and Mrs. Doubtfire (1993), but I think this is, in a more modest way, one of his best performances.Also featured is Hilary Swank, whom you should see in Boys Don't Cry (1999) if you haven't, as Ellie Burr, an ingenue Alaskan detective in awe of the master cop from the big city.  Notable in a modest role is Jonathan Jackson as Randy Stetz, a high schooler with a chip on his shoulder.  I also liked the brief appearance by Katharine Isabelle, who played the murder girl's trampy girlfriend.The key psychological question in both films is why does Will Dormer decide to cover up the accidental shooting?  In director Erik Skjoldbjaerg's 1997 film the answer is human nature.  That certainly worked, but was not enough for Nolan, and so he gives us Dormer's Internal Affairs problems back in L.A. as further motivation.  This works very well for two reasons: One, it is convincing.  Recall his spontaneous confession to the hotel clerk (Maura Tierney).  And two, the cop problems in Los Angeles are right out of the headlines of recent years.  They are real.  Nolan even has Ellie find a copy of the Los Angeles Times with one of the stories on the front page.The next psychological question is, is the villain a serial killer in the making?  If he is, then Dormer must stop him regardless of his own problems.  And therein lies the internal conflict of the film so well projected by Al Pacino.  We know that there is something more than the midnight sun to account for Dormer's disintegration.  He is a flawed cop.  Like some of his real life counterparts in L.A. and elsewhere he took it upon himself, by falsifying evidence, to administer justice to a man he knew was guilty.  When he did that, he knew (and this is something he teaches Ellie) that he had lost his integrity as a cop.  The temptation to frame somebody we know is guilty of a horrendous crime is very great and many of us would fall into it.Since I cannot discuss the ending here in any concrete way, let me just say that if Nolan had really taken his time with the ending he might have had Dormer simply murder the villain and face the consequences (or even commit suicide).  But I suspect Nolan believed that the heroic character of his star would have been compromised.  In Skjoldbjaerg's film the police detective actually shoots the dog to obtain the spent bullet he needs.  In Nolan's film the dog is already dead.  I think this minor blush of character actually taints Nolan's film to some small degree and leads Nolan down the path to the Hollywood ending to come.  But judge for yourselfOne final point.  A lot can be gotten out of a single camera shot.  This is something that Nolan does very well.  A case in point is the shot on the plastic evidence bag holding the bullet that Dormer picks up in the lab.  Nolan has the camera show us the words on the bag, ""chain of custody,"" and he has the camera linger long enough for us to read them.  This nice touch reminds us that THAT very chain of custody is being compromised, another echo of real life criminal investigations from recent years in L.A.See this for Al Pacino, at his best here, one of the great stars of our era whose ability to command the screen is second to none.",4,Compelling,1042761600,"01 17, 2003",2003,4893,"['finely', 'wrought', 'remake', 'Norwegian', 'film', 'same',

709235,A2NWMKTGGROUM8,B00006AGHD,"""doctor_smith""","[3, 3]","Christopher Nolan is a talented director, no doubt. His previous film ""Memento"" is proof of that.  This film is proof as well, although it clearly shows the hallmarks of a Hollywood production: it proceeds cautiously and with great skill, but it feels like chartered territory: the villian (played with aplomb by Robin Williams) has to explain his motivations, thereby robbing the film of a little mystery, and the films ends in a way that is too rudimentary, too conventional for a film of this caliber. Ultimately, these flaws (and a few others) make ""Insomnia"" less satisfying than it could be. The fault is not necessarily Mr. Nolan's; it could very well lie with the screenwriter or, what is more likely, with the producers and the distributor. When ""foreign"" filmmakers come to Hollywood (Nolan is British), they are often ""forced"" to make more conventional films.But even with its conventional elements, ""Insomnia"" is about as skillful in its execution as a film can be.  It's tense and captivating, and the performances all around are praiseworthy.  Pacino gives all the hot-blooded gusto we normally associate with him, but it's toned down successfully, which helps to strengthen the heaviness and lingering exhaustion that the murder investigation (which is the film's subject) entails. The setting is perfect: Nolan takes the Alaskan climate and washes it beautifully with gray, blue, white, and green hues, with a never-ending, penetrating, suffusing light that renders Pacino an insomniac and that gives weight to the film's central themes. It's highly intelligent without being emotionally empty. Nolan understands nuance, and he has an uncanny ability to make the best out of his material.I cannot rate this film too highly because I felt it ultimately underwhelms with its conventions, but, by the same token, I will admit that I was taken aback by the ardor, skill, and technical assurance with which Nolan tells this story. Few films tie the strands together as well as this one does; even fewer match the visual language as precisely to the subject matter.  It's an achievement, even if I kept feeling, particularly at the end of the film, that I've seen it before, only because Hollywood is better at repackaging the same elements instead of originating new ones.On the DVD itself: a good transfer, with a crips image and sound. Particularly appealing is a special feature in which Nolan discusses the film in the sequence in which it was shot -- now there is something original!",3,"A highly skillful, if conventional, film.",1041897600,"01 7, 2003",2003,2499,"['Christopher', 'Nolan', 'talented', 'director', 'doubt', 'previous', 'film', 'Memento', 'proof', 'film', 'proof', 'as', 'well', 'clearly', 'hallmarks', 'Hollywood', 'production', 'cautiously', 'great', 'skill', 'chartered', 'territory', 'villian', 'played', 'aplomb', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'explain', 'motivations', 'thereby', 'robbing', 'film', 'little', 'mystery', 'films', 'way', 'too', 'rudimentary', 'too', 'conventional', 'film', 'caliber', 'Ultimately', 'flaws', 'few', 'others', 'make', 'Insomnia', 'less', 'satisfying', 'could', 'be', 'fault', 'not', 'necessarily', 'Mr.', 'Nolan', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'lie', 'screenwriter', 'what', 'more', 'likely', 'producers', 'distributor', 'When', 'foreign', 'filmmakers', 'come', 'Hollywood', 'Nolan', 'British', 'are', 'often', 'forced', 'make', 'more', 'conventional', 'films.But', 'even', 'conventional', 'elements', 'Insomnia', 'about', 'as', 'skillful', 'execution', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'tense', 'captivating', 'performances', 'around', 'are', 'praiseworthy', 'Pacino', 'hot-blooded', 'gusto', 'normally', 'associate', 'toned', 'down', 'successfully', 'strengthen', 'heaviness', 'lingering', 'exhaustion', 'murder', 'investigation', 'film', 'subject', 'setting', 'perfect', 'Nolan', 'Alaskan', 'climate', 'washes', 'beautifully', 'gray', 'blue', 'white', 'green', 'hues', 'never-ending', 'penetrating', 'suffusing', 'light', 'Pacino', 'insomniac', 'weight', 'film', 'central', 'themes', 'highly', 'intelligent', 'being', 'emotionally', 'empty', 'Nolan', 'nuance', 'uncanny', 'ability', 'make', 'best', 'material.I', 'can', 'not', 'rate', 'film', 'too', 'highly', 'felt', 'ultimately', 'underwhelms', 'conventions', 'same', 'token', 'will', 'admit', 'was', 'taken', 'aback', 'ardor', 'skill', 'technical', 'assurance', 'Nolan', 'story', 'Few', 'films', 'tie', 'strands', 'together', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'even', 'fewer', 'match', 'visual', 'language', 'as', 'precisely', 'subject', 'matter', 'achievement', 'even', 'kept', 'feeling', 'particularly', 'end', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'only', 'Hollywood', 'better', 'repackaging', 'same', 'elements', 'instead', 'originating', 'new', 'DVD', 'good', 'transfer', 'crips', 'image', 'sound', 'Particularly', 'appealing', 'special', 'feature', 'Nolan', 'film', 'sequence', 'was', 'shot', 'now', 'something', 'original']",Insomnia Region 2

Though not as groundbreaking as either Godfather film, ""The Conversation"", in my mind, was one of the better movies from the 70's. I feel the same way about ""Insomnia"". Though not as revolutionary as ""Memento"", it is still a fine film in its own right and should not be compared to it. I mention this because a lot of people seem to unfairly criticize it as well as director Christopher Nolan because it's not ""Memento II"".By revealing early on in the film who the bad guy is, ""Insomnia"" adds a nice twist to the suspense genre. The suspense is held up by the protagonist's inner conflict of right and wrong. As you probably know, Al Pacino plays an L.A. detective Will Dormer who is brought Alaska to investigate a murder. It's also a chance for Dormer to escape some professional problems he is dealing with back home. Accompanying Dormer is Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan), his partner from L.A. who can potentially make things worse for Dormer back home. Through a sequence of events, the problems that face Dormer back home are minimized, but not without consequences. The murderer in Alaska now has something on Dormer and wants to negotiate. What will Dormer do? These pressures coupled with Alaska's white nights keep Dormer up at night. The whole thing induces quite a bit of tension. Al Pacino is his usual amazing self.

They either find the film to far from ""Memento,"" or to close to ""Memento,"" which is beyond explanation on my part. The fact is, Christopher Nolan does an outstanding job with this film, and nothing more nor nothing less should have been done in the creation and editing of this film.  The truth is, this movie isn't much like ""Memento,"" but more like ""Insomnia.""A reviewer here posted that most of the shots are over-stylized, exaggerated, and uncomfortable to watch.

709239,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B00006AGHD,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","Out of all the movies Christopher Nolan has directed, ""Insomnia"" is probably the most... normal. No dream technology, no superheroes, no magical Tesla devices.No, ""Insomnia"" is pretty much a cop thriller about hunting down a murderer. But it's much deeper and more layered than it sounds -- it's a tragic, haunting story of a good cop who begins sliding inexorably down, until he ends up collaborating with a murderer. And in true Nolan style, it's murky and slightly disorienting.LAPD detectives Will Dormer (Al Pacino) and Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) are sent to the remote town of Nightmute, up in Alaska, to investigate the shocking death of a teenage girl. There's some tension between the detectives because Dormer is under investigation by Internal Affairs, and Eckhart is going to testify against him.And since Nightmute is in the Arctic Circle, the sun never sets in summer. Unable to sleep, Dormer becomes increasingly disoriented -- until he accidentally shoots Eckhart while chasing the murderer.Knowing that no one would believe it was an accident, Dormer desperately hides the evidence of his crime. But there was one witness to the shooting -- the murderer, mystery writer Walter Finch (Robin Williams). Finch is only willing to keep silent if Dormer frames the dead girl's boyfriend, and lets him go free.Based on a Norwegian film of the same name, ""Insomnia"" is essentially a study of guilt. It's never entirely clear whether Dormer's insomnia is caused by the daylight (symbolic light of truth?) or his own guilty conscience, but the events of the movie are a tragic portrait of a fundamentally good man degenerating before our eyes.And it's one of the best roles that Al Pacino has done in years -- he depicts Dormer as a man who desperately wants to do the right thing, but is twisted into doing the WRONG thing out of his own fear. And Nolan leaves you wondering if, on some subconscious level, he did want to shoot his partner for betraying him.And if Dormer is in the middle of the moral spectrum, then Finch and Ellie Burr are on the two extremes. I normally cannot stand Robin Williams, but he gives a surprisingly good performance as a genial yet ice-cold murderer who wants to drag Dormer down with him. And Hilary Swank is excellent as a pure-hearted young cop who is investigating Eckhart's murder.As for Nolan, he cloaks the movie in a sense of stillness and a pale, strange daylight that never goes away, and he builds up a slow-burning sense of suspense right to the subdued ending. This makes it all the more shocking when Dormer's sleeplessness catches up to him, causing him to act recklessly and even hallucinate -- suddenly the world seems jagged and chaotic for a few minutes, before snapping back to normal.In fact, the movie is at its weakest when it focuses just on police procedural stuff, instead of following Dormer's descent. Even if those scenes are essential to the plot, Nolan cannot make that interesting.While not exactly what people expect from Christopher Nolan, ""Insomnia"" is a beautifully tragic little movie, with amazing acting and exquisite direction.",4,Without sleep,1365465600,"04 9, 2013",2013,3109,"['movies', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'directed', 'Insomnia', 'probably', 'most', 'normal', 'dream', 'technology', 'superheroes', 'magical', 'Tesla', 'devices.No', 'Insomnia', 'pretty', 'much', 'cop', 'thriller', 'hunting', 'down', 'murderer', 'much', 'deeper', 'more', 'layered', 'tragic', 'haunting', 'story', 'good', 'cop', 'who', 'sliding', 'inexorably', 'down', 'up', 'collaborating', 'murderer', 'true', 'Nolan', 'style', 'murky', 'slightly', 'disorienting.LAPD', 'detectives', 'Will', 'Dormer', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Hap', 'Eckhart', 'Martin', 'Donovan', 'are', 'sent', 'remote', 'town', 'Nightmute', 'up', 'Alaska', 'investigate', 'shocking', 'death', 'teenage', 'girl', 'tension', 'detectives', 'Dormer', 'investigation', 'Internal', 'Affairs', 'Eckhart', 'going', 'testify', 'him.And', 'Nightmute', 'Arctic', 'Circle', 'sun', 'never', 'summer', 'Unable', 'sleep', 'Dormer', 'increasingly', 'disoriented', 'accidentally', 'shoots', 'Eckhart', 'chasing', 'murderer.Knowing', 'one', 'would', 'believe', 'was', 'accident', 'Dormer', 'desperately', 'evidence', 'crime', 'was', 'one', 'witness', 'shooting', 'murderer', 'mystery', 'writer', 'Walter', 'Finch', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Finch', 'only', 'willing', 'keep', 'silent', 'Dormer', 'dead', 'girl', 'boyfriend', 'go', 'free.Based', 'Norwegian', 'film', 'same', 'name', 'Insomnia', 'essentially', 'study', 'guilt', 'never', 'entirely', 'clear', 'Dormer', 'insomnia', 'caused', 'daylight', 'symbolic', 'light', 'truth', 'own', 'guilty', 'conscience', 'events', 'movie', 'are', 'tragic', 'portrait', 'fundamentally', 'good', 'man', 'degenerating', 'eyes.And', 'one', 'best', 'roles', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'done', 'years', 'Dormer', 'man', 'who', 'desperately', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'twisted', 'doing', 'WRONG', 'thing', 'own', 'fear', 'Nolan', 'wondering', 'subconscious', 'level', 'did', 'want', 'shoot', 'partner', 'betraying', 'him.And', 'Dormer', 'middle', 'moral', 'spectrum', 'then', 'Finch', 'Ellie', 'Burr', 'are', 'two', 'extremes', 'normally', 'can', 'not', 'stand', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'performance', 'genial', 'yet', 'ice-cold', 'murderer', 'who', 'drag', 'Dormer', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'excellent', 'pure-hearted', 'young', 'cop', 'who', 'investigating', 'Eckhart', 'murder.As', 'Nolan', 'movie', 'sense', 'stillness', 'pale', 'strange', 'daylight', 'never', 'away', 'up', 'slow-burning', 'sense', 'suspense', 'right', 'subdued', 'ending', 'more', 'shocking', 'when', 'Dormer', 'sleeplessness', 'up', 'causing', 'act', 'recklessly', 'even', 'hallucinate', 'suddenly', 'world', 'jagged', 'chaotic', 'few', 'minutes', 'snapping', 'back', 'normal.In', 'fact', 'movie', 'weakest', 'when', 'just', 'police', 'procedural', 'stuff', 'instead', 'following', 'Dormer', 'descent', 'Even', 'scenes', 'are', 'essential', 'plot', 'Nolan', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'interesting.While', 'not', 'exactly', 'what', 'people', 'expect', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'Insomnia', 'beautifully', 'tragic', 'little', 'movie', 'amazing', 'acting', 'exquisite', 'direction']",Insomnia Region 2
709240,AC1K4OQOZ90RS,B00006AGHD,"E. Bukowsky ""booklover10""","[2, 2]","""Insomnia"" is one of those rare movies that resonate in your mind long after you leave the theater.  It is a wonderful ensemble effort, with Al Pacino as the standout in an excellent cast.  Pacino's performance is his finest in years, and it adds to the luster of an already legendary acting career.Pacino plays Will Dormer, a veteran cop who, along with his partner, Hap Eckhart, is under investigation by Internal Affairs in Los Angeles for alleged misconduct on the job. Dormer and Hap temporarily escape from their troubles by flying to Nightmute, Alaska, to help a former colleague investigate the brutal murder of a seventeen-year-old girl.Suddenly, Hap confides to Will that he intends to cooperate with the authorities in Internal Affairs and cut a deal, which horrifies Dormer.  Not only will Dormer's stellar career end in ruins, but his closed cases may also be reopened and convictions may eventually be overturned.Dormer's troubles are just beginning.  During a chase scene in which Dormer, Hap and the Nightmute cops are on the heels of the killer, Dorner accidentally shoots his partner in a dense fog.  The questions is, was the shooting really an accident? Was Dormer, either consciously or subconsciously, looking for a way to make sure that Hap would never have the opportunity to cut a deal with Internal Affairs?  This is one of the many moral dilemmas that this complex film raises.Things go from bad to worse.  Dormer blames the shooting on the killer, a writer named Walter Finch, played with quiet and understated menace by Robin Williams.  Unfortunately for Dormer, Finch witnessed him shooting Hap, and the killer offers to cut a deal of his own with Dormer.  If Dormer blames the girl's murder on her brutal boyfriend, Finch will not turn Dormer in for shooting his partner.All this makes for an intricate and intelligent film, beautifully photographed in British Columbia, with an excellent use of blinding light that contrasts with the dark emotions churning in the main characters.  The film builds in intensity as the action progresses.Pacino is fabulous as a man who has gone astray.  He has spent decades as a policeman and genuinely loves his job, but he has cut too many corners and it is too late to regain his lost innocence.  The scenes between him and Robin Williams are terrific.  Williams considers himself Dormer's equal.  Both men have a great deal to hide and both men in some ways consider themselves above the law.  Since Finch is a writer of crime thrillers, he thinks of himself as something of an expert on the criminal justice system, as well.  Will Dormer take the low road once again, and cooperate with Finch in order to save his own career?Hilary Swank is wonderful as the starry eyed Ellie Burr, a promising rookie cop who worships Dormer for his stellar reputation, until she finds out that her hero has feet of clay.Adding to the ambiance of the movie are the striking scenes depicting Dormer's insomnia.  He cannot get used to the sun shining late throughout the night in Alaska, and he goes for days without sleep.  As Pacino's mental state deteriorates, he becomes more and more disoriented and tortured.

Frampton ""Parandot""","[2, 4]","Before I start, I must admit to not seeing the fascination with Memento, I thought it was a decent movie, but the amount of attention and adoration that it got surprised me completely, I thought it was a pretty good genre film that had some interesting parts but mostly relied on a gimmick.  Christopher Nolan, the brit responsible for the direction of that movie moved from that to this film, a remake of a Norwegian thriller which I wanted so see a while ago, but the [local] video store didn't have it(surprise, surprise).  Anyway, this film pretty much confirmed my suspicions, Nolan is a pretty average filmmaker who can use gimmicks to make a compelling film, but can't make a compelling film without a gimmick.  I thought this would be a well-thought out police-procedural, or maybe a psychological thriller, but its really neither.  Its just so ridiculously devoid of emotion, that the movie becomes arbitary.  Its full of plot devices, such as the fog during the stakeout.  Did anyone see that thick fog before the chase started, I didn't think so.  Another is the sunlight that keeps him awake, Nolan ever really explores the insomnia that thoroughly.  He just says here we go, cue the disorienting sound and jumpy images, there we go, thats all we need.  Nolan is one of the few filmmakers to completely disorient me during a gun battle and the subsequent fight, I had no idea what was going on, and that couldn't have been the idea.  I do have to give him credit for his little snippets of the victim shown throughout, which convey the innocence of her completely.  The acting is really quite good, Al is great as always, people say he chews the scenery, they can shove it I like him for it, all this understatement gets a little weary.  Robin Williams makes for a completely boring killer, which is good, I don't need the long-winded speeches on human nature from a psychopath, that got old 10 yrs ago.  Hilary Swank isn't given much to do, she just puts the pieces together slowly but surely.  The ending is awful, I mean it wouldn't be so bad, but Al's last line is just terrible and way too easy.  All I can say is I thought Nolan would make something more interesting, and prove me wrong about his talents, but it seems he needs to get back to writing his own stuff, maybe he can prove me wrong another time.",2,Gone are the days,1022889600,"06 1, 2002",2002,2325,"['start', 'must', 'admit', 'not', 'seeing', 'fascination', 'Memento', 'thought', 'was', 'decent', 'movie', 'amount', 'attention', 'adoration', 'got', 'surprised', 'completely', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'genre', 'film', 'had', 'interesting', 'parts', 'mostly', 'relied', 'gimmick', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'brit', 'responsible', 'direction', 'movie', 'moved', 'film', 'remake', 'Norwegian', 'thriller', 'wanted', 'so', 'see', 'while', 'ago', '[', 'local', ']', 'video', 'store', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'surprise', 'surprise', 'Anyway', 'film', 'pretty', 'much', 'confirmed', 'suspicions', 'Nolan', 'pretty', 'average', 'filmmaker', 'who', 'can', 'use', 'gimmicks', 'make', 'compelling', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'compelling', 'film', 'gimmick', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'well-thought', 'police-procedural', 'maybe', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'really', 'just', 'so', 'ridiculously', 'devoid', 'emotion', 'movie', 'arbitary', 'full', 'plot', 'devices', 'such', 'fog', 'stakeout', 'Did', 'anyone', 'see', 'thick', 'fog', 'chase', 'started', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'sunlight', 'awake', 'Nolan', 'ever', 'really', 'insomnia', 'thoroughly', 'just', 'here', 'go', 'cue', 'disorienting', 'sound', 'jumpy', 'images', 'go', 'thats', 'need', 'Nolan', 'one', 'few', 'filmmakers', 'completely', 'disorient', 'gun', 'battle', 'subsequent', 'fight', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'idea', 'do', 'have', 'give', 'credit', 'little', 'snippets', 'victim', 'shown', 'convey', 'innocence', 'completely', 'acting', 'really', 'quite', 'good', 'Al', 'great', 'always', 'people', 'say', 'scenery', 'can', 'shove', 'like', 'understatement', 'little', 'weary', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'completely', 'boring', 'killer', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'long-winded', 'speeches', 'human', 'nature', 'psychopath', 'got', 'old', '10', 'yrs', 'ago', 'Hilary', 'Swank', ""n't"", 'given', 'much', 'do', 'just', 'pieces', 'together', 'slowly', 'surely', 'ending', 'awful', 'mean', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'bad', 'Al', 'last', 'line', 'just', 'terrible', 'way', 'too', 'easy', 'can', 'say', 'thought', 'Nolan', 'would', 'make', 'something', 'more', 'interesting', 'prove', 'wrong', 'talents', 'get', 'back', 'writing', 'own', 'stuff', 'maybe', 'can', 'prove', 'wrong', 'time']",Insomnia Region 2

Pacino does a credible job as a cop who really needs a good snooze, but all the pacing did for me was make me want to nap myself, and that's the problem.The disappointment is that I was looking forward to the movie, especially the interaction with the killer. This is not the first movie that Al Pacino plays a cop who verbally confronts the bad guy before the inevitable violent end. He did it in ""Heat"" with Robert DiNiro, and in that picture there was blazing chemistry. Once again, maybe it's the sleep thing, but I really think the whole insomnia issue prevents any real electricity from happening.I would have liked to have seen the movie redone without the whole lack of sleep thing.

709245,A3JD8FDS3CO3GH,B00006AGHD,FairiesWearBoots8272,"[3, 3]","Christopher Nolan's follow-up to his innovative breakthrough hit Memento didn't attract a third of the attention or acclaim of the previous film, despite the presence of three Oscar-winners in lead roles. I feel that Insomnia was unjustly ignored at the box office and even at the Academy Awards. In my opinion, it was one of the best American films of 2002. I had high expectations for Insomnia, considering that Christopher Nolan was directing that Al Pacino and Robin Williams were starring. Happily, my expectations were exceeded. Insomnia is one of the downright best mystery-thrillers in a long time.I hear many people complain that it's a slow-moving film. Well, this is basically true. It's not concerned with exciting action sequences, shoot-outs or over-the-top acting. It's concerned with the emotions of its characters. It's a psychological drama that puts us inside the head of its lead character, Det. Will Dormer (Al Pacino). In a way, it's sort of a head trip similar to Memento. Memento was a very subjective film that put us in the head of its memory-loss-stricken protagonist. In Insomnia, Pacino's character deals not with memory loss, but with mental instability resulting from sleep deprivation. That's what makes the film fascinating. How the audience gets to experience what's going through Dormer's frazzled mind. He is drawn into a cat and mouse game with the killer he is pursuing, but due to his state of mind, things become very difficult.Based on a 1997 Norwegian film, Insomnia is a rare remake that manages to be more effective than the original. I should go back and watch the original again, but I found Nolan's film to surpass the original by far. Credit should, however, go to Erik Skjoldbjrg, director and co-writer of the original film. This film would not exist without the wonderful story written by Nikolaj Frobenius and Erik Skjoldbjrg. It's a tense, psychological story of a detective trying to solve a murder case, but plagued by ever-present sunlight resulting in the titular state, insomnia.Hillary Seitz's wonderful screenplay is based on that story and director Christopher Nolan weaves it into a stunning and complex mystery. Al Pacino gives one of his most memorable performances of recent years with his subtle take on the beleaguered detective. How Pacino manages to look so deathly exhausted, I don't know. Robin Williams also gives another great dramatic performance. I hoped that Insomnia would receive a few Academy Award nominations, such as Best Director for Nolan, Best Screenplay, Best Actor for Pacino, but the film was snubbed. It was a distant memory by the time Oscar season came around.Do not make the same mistake as the Academy. Do not overlook this wonderful thriller. Insomnia will make you believe that Christopher Nolan is one of the most talented young directors working in the industry today. Also be sure to catch his first two films, Following (1998) and Memento (2001). Of course, Nolan has since gone on to make the best Batman movie ever (2005's Batman Begins) and the excellent 2006 thriller The Prestige. Anything with Christopher Nolan's name on it is excellent. He is simply one of the finest directors working today. I eagerly await his next project: the Batman Begins sequel, The Dark Knight.",5,Another excellent Christopher Nolan thriller,1187827200,"08 23, 2007",2007,3276,"['Christopher', 'Nolan', 'follow-up', 'innovative', 'breakthrough', 'hit', 'Memento', 'did', ""n't"", 'attract', 'third', 'attention', 'acclaim', 'previous', 'film', 'presence', 'three', 'Oscar-winners', 'lead', 'roles', 'feel', 'Insomnia', 'was', 'unjustly', 'ignored', 'box', 'office', 'even', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'opinion', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'American', 'films', '2002', 'had', 'high', 'expectations', 'Insomnia', 'considering', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'was', 'directing', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'were', 'starring', 'Happily', 'expectations', 'were', 'exceeded', 'Insomnia', 'one', 'downright', 'best', 'mystery-thrillers', 'long', 'time.I', 'hear', 'many', 'people', 'complain', 'slow-moving', 'film', 'Well', 'basically', 'true', 'not', 'concerned', 'exciting', 'action', 'sequences', 'shoot-outs', 'over-the-top', 'acting', 'concerned', 'emotions', 'characters', 'psychological', 'drama', 'head', 'lead', 'character', 'Det', 'Will', 'Dormer', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'way', 'sort', 'head', 'trip', 'similar', 'Memento', 'Memento', 'was', 'very', 'subjective', 'film', 'put', 'head', 'memory-loss-stricken', 'protagonist', 'Insomnia', 'Pacino', 'character', 'deals', 'not', 'memory', 'loss', 'mental', 'instability', 'resulting', 'sleep', 'deprivation', 'what', 'film', 'fascinating', 'How', 'audience', 'experience', 'what', 'going', 'Dormer', 'frazzled', 'mind', 'drawn', 'cat', 'mouse', 'game', 'killer', 'pursuing', 'due', 'state', 'mind', 'things', 'become', 'very', 'difficult.Based', '1997', 'Norwegian', 'film', 'Insomnia', 'rare', 'remake', 'be', 'more', 'effective', 'original', 'should', 'go', 'back', 'watch', 'original', 'again', 'found', 'Nolan', 'film', 'surpass', 'original', 'far', 'Credit', 'should', 'however', 'go', 'Erik', 'Skjoldbjrg', 'director', 'co-writer', 'original', 'film', 'film', 'would', 'not', 'exist', 'wonderful', 'story', 'written', 'Nikolaj', 'Frobenius', 'Erik', 'Skjoldbjrg', 'tense', 'psychological', 'story', 'detective', 'trying', 'solve', 'murder', 'case', 'plagued', 'ever-present', 'sunlight', 'resulting', 'titular', 'state', 'insomnia.Hillary', 'Seitz', 'wonderful', 'screenplay', 'based', 'story', 'director', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'stunning', 'complex', 'mystery', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'performances', 'recent', 'years', 'subtle', 'take', 'beleaguered', 'detective', 'How', 'Pacino', 'look', 'so', 'deathly', 'exhausted', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'also', 'great', 'dramatic', 'performance', 'hoped', 'Insomnia', 'would', 'receive', 'few', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominations', 'such', 'Best', 'Director', 'Nolan', 'Best', 'Screenplay', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Pacino', 'film', 'was', 'snubbed', 'was', 'distant', 'memory', 'time', 'Oscar', 'season', 'came', 'around.Do', 'not', 'make', 'same', 'mistake', 'Academy', 'Do', 'not', 'overlook', 'wonderful', 'thriller', 'Insomnia', 'will', 'make', 'believe', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'one', 'most', 'talented', 'young', 'directors', 'working', 'industry', 'today', 'Also', 'be', 'sure', 'catch', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'Following', '1998', 'Memento', '2001', 'course', 'Nolan', 'gone', 'make', 'best', 'Batman', 'movie', 'ever', '2005', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'excellent', '2006', 'Prestige', 'Anything', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'name', 'excellent', 'simply', 'one', 'finest', 'directors', 'working', 'today', 'eagerly', 'await', 'next', 'project', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'sequel', 'Dark', 'Knight']",Insomnia Region 2

His voice inflection has changed completely from the usual clown we're used to, his way of looking, restraint,.... everything new for us audiences, he really did a very fine job.I'd read the critics' reviews before watching this film, and although they were good, anyway, I didn't expect it would be as good a movie, with such a surprising plot- when the movie begins, you think it will take a very different ""path"" from the one that it really takes, unpredictable, such as real life is.In all, a completely satisfying experience, maybe, except for the final scene- which some may consider sort-of-clich&eacute;d - but I did not.

709248,AL0C7WML6GMEA,B00006AGHD,"F. Jarlett ""Movie Maniac""","[9, 22]","I am amazed and mystified that most of the reviewers herein found the movie to be excellent!! As for me, I made it about thirty minutes into the film before turning it off in dismay. The fault in order of importance: poor screenplay, poor cinematography and poor performance by Pacino, who seems to be vying for the most over-the-top performance. The film was absurd in many ways from the outset: the pans from star to star lasting just short of giving the viewer any purpose for any of the fast camera pans. Close-up after close-up conveying no meaning, Pacino overacting like Jack Palance in one of his not-so-famous European pieces of tripe from the sixties and seventies, an utterly dumb plot with Pacino and company proving at the beginning that they are bumbling cops.First example, they chase the bad guy to a cabin which is on stilts or something like that; then, instead of staying on the ground below and smoking the bad guy out or something at least tactically sound, they storm the stairs and Pacino stands right in front of the door yelling ""Police, you're under arrest.""They kick in the front door and find that the culprit has escaped through an underground water source. Of course, Pacino follows and dives right into the underwater stream, having absolutely no idea where the guy is or if there are boobytraps of some sort.Cut to Pacino running around in nearly zero visibility fog, glimpsing the guy for a second or two before losing him in the fog. Stumbling around further, Pacino is obviously disoriented until a shot is fired at him from, we must assume, his quarry. Did the screen writer forget that Pacino's colleagues are also supposedly chasing the culprit, too?Inevitably and apparently not, because Pacino spots a figure in the fog and plugs him. As I watched this scene unfold, I became thoroughly disheartened when it becomes clear what I knew already, that Pacino has fired on and killed his partner. It was then that I decided that I had had enough.By the way, the European version, with Stellan Skarsgaard is infinitely superior. Don't waste your money or on-line rental queue on this Hollywood drivel. Ditto for the other Pacino junk I rented at the same time, The Recruit, which I could only stand for about a half hour too.",1,Looks like a routine television program.,1154908800,"08 7, 2006",2006,2259,"['am', 'amazed', 'mystified', 'most', 'reviewers', 'herein', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'excellent', 'made', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'film', 'turning', 'off', 'dismay', 'fault', 'order', 'importance', 'poor', 'screenplay', 'poor', 'cinematography', 'poor', 'performance', 'Pacino', 'who', 'be', 'vying', 'most', 'over-the-top', 'performance', 'film', 'was', 'absurd', 'many', 'ways', 'outset', 'pans', 'star', 'star', 'lasting', 'just', 'short', 'giving', 'viewer', 'purpose', 'fast', 'camera', 'pans', 'Close-up', 'close-up', 'conveying', 'meaning', 'Pacino', 'overacting', 'Jack', 'Palance', 'one', 'not-so-famous', 'European', 'pieces', 'tripe', 'sixties', 'seventies', 'utterly', 'dumb', 'plot', 'Pacino', 'company', 'proving', 'beginning', 'are', 'bumbling', 'cops.First', 'example', 'chase', 'bad', 'guy', 'cabin', 'stilts', 'something', 'then', 'instead', 'staying', 'ground', 'smoking', 'bad', 'guy', 'something', 'least', 'tactically', 'sound', 'storm', 'stairs', 'Pacino', 'stands', 'right', 'front', 'door', 'yelling', 'Police', ""'re"", 'arrest', 'kick', 'front', 'door', 'find', 'culprit', 'escaped', 'underground', 'water', 'source', 'course', 'Pacino', 'right', 'underwater', 'stream', 'having', 'absolutely', 'idea', 'where', 'guy', 'are', 'boobytraps', 'sort.Cut', 'Pacino', 'running', 'around', 'nearly', 'zero', 'visibility', 'fog', 'glimpsing', 'guy', 'second', 'two', 'losing', 'fog', 'Stumbling', 'further', 'Pacino', 'obviously', 'disoriented', 'shot', 'fired', 'must', 'assume', 'quarry', 'Did', 'screen', 'writer', 'forget', 'Pacino', 'colleagues', 'are', 'also', 'supposedly', 'chasing', 'culprit', 'too', 'Inevitably', 'apparently', 'not', 'Pacino', 'spots', 'figure', 'fog', 'watched', 'scene', 'unfold', 'became', 'thoroughly', 'disheartened', 'when', 'clear', 'what', 'knew', 'already', 'Pacino', 'fired', 'killed', 'partner', 'was', 'then', 'decided', 'had', 'had', 'enough.By', 'way', 'European', 'version', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgaard', 'infinitely', 'superior', 'Do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'money', 'on-line', 'rental', 'queue', 'Hollywood', 'drivel', 'Ditto', 'other', 'Pacino', 'junk', 'rented', 'same', 'time', 'Recruit', 'could', 'only', 'stand', 'half', 'hour', 'too']",Insomnia Region 2

I also have no interest in 'mob' movies; consequently, I've actually not seen much of Al Pacino before. Wow; what a great actor, and he is onscreen nearly every moment from start to finish. Will Dormer (Pacino) is a most compelling character, struggling increasingly with his demons as he tries to stay focused despite being severely sleep-deprived, having been sent to Alaska during the ""white nights"" season to solve a criminal case. The story is presented in such a way as to engage and involve the viewer in Dormer's dilemma(s), and the Alaskan landscape (though I think most of it was actually Vancouver) is breathtakingly beautiful, making me wish I'd seen this movie in a theater. However, had I seen the theatrical trailer first I never would have taken an interest in ""Insomnia"". The trailer makes it look like a typical formulaic action movie; ugh. Instead, I read between the lines of others' opinions and trusted my instincts that ""Insomnia"" is a movie well worth viewing.

709250,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00006AGHD,"""flickjunkie""","[3, 5]","Director Christopher Nolan made a sensational splash with the indie hit &quot;Memento&quot;, earning him this shot at the big time.  For the most part, he proved himself up to the task.  &quot;Insomnia&quot; provides a multilayered psychological thriller where two distinct storylines are interwoven in the character of Will Dormer (Al Pacino).The workup is a bit contrived, with Dormer coming to Alaska from LA to help out an old buddy with a murder investigation as he is himself being investigated by internal affairs.  This serves as a foundation for the two storylines.  The first is the animosity that develops between Dormer and his partner, who wants to cut a deal with internal affairs.  The second, of course, is the murder investigation.  After Dormer accidentally (?) shoots his partner while chasing the suspect in dense fog, the psychological games begin.  Local detective Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank), who is fawning all over Dormer and has read all his books on detective work, begins to suspect that her hero may have feet of clay.The psychodrama becomes intense as Dormer is confronted with communications from his killer nemesis Walter Finch (Robin Williams), while suspicions swirl around the death of his partner.  Add to this his inability to get any sleep in Alaska's perpetual daylight and you have a man driven to the absolute brink.Nolan does an excellent job of shooting this film and the editing intensifies the psychological tension.  The cinematography is also superb, aided by the majesctic Alaskan and British Columbian locations.  While the interaction between Dormer and Finch is unlikely, the symbiotic relationship that develops is fascinating and Nolan squeezes every psychological tingle that can be wrung from it.Pacino is masterful as the insomniac cop who has made certain ethical compromises in his career in the name of justice.  He looks so terrible that he must have been purposely depriving himself of sleep to increase the realism of the character.  Pacino gives Dormer (an interesting play on the latin dormire, &quot;to sleep&quot;, a dormer is the window of a sleeping room) a hard edge that gradually erodes as he becomes more sleep deprived, blurring the distinction between good and evil.Robin Williams seems to be trying to shed his nice guy image with back to back wackos.  He follows up his sociopathic performance in &quot;1 Hour Photo&quot; with this character who is a sort of sinister pragmatist.  Williams is at his best when he is pushing sanity's limits, whether that be in zany comedy or maniacal mayhem, which is precisely why he was wrong for this part.  This character is far too calculating and controlled for Williams talents and the part was also much too physical for him.  He is just not convincing as a cold blooded killer and tough guy.  That is not to say it was a bad performance, just the wrong actor.  Hilary Swank unfortunately doesn't have much to do in a film that is dominated by Pacino and Williams.This is an excellent big budget debut for Nolan and another terrific performance by Pacino.  The suspense and pace are first rate and despite the contrivances, it delivers.  I rated it an 8/10.  Definitely not a snoozer.",4,Taut detective thriller,1036800000,"11 9, 2002",2002,3199,"['Director', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'made', 'sensational', 'splash', 'indie', 'hit', 'quot', 'Memento', 'quot', 'earning', 'shot', 'big', 'time', 'most', 'part', 'proved', 'task', 'quot', 'Insomnia', 'quot', 'multilayered', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'where', 'two', 'distinct', 'storylines', 'are', 'interwoven', 'character', 'Will', 'Dormer', 'Al', 'Pacino', '.The', 'workup', 'bit', 'contrived', 'Dormer', 'coming', 'Alaska', 'LA', 'help', 'out', 'old', 'buddy', 'murder', 'investigation', 'being', 'investigated', 'internal', 'affairs', 'foundation', 'two', 'storylines', 'first', 'animosity', 'Dormer', 'partner', 'who', 'cut', 'deal', 'internal', 'affairs', 'second', 'course', 'murder', 'investigation', 'Dormer', 'accidentally', 'shoots', 'partner', 'chasing', 'suspect', 'dense', 'fog', 'psychological', 'games', 'begin', 'Local', 'detective', 'Ellie', 'Burr', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'who', 'fawning', 'Dormer', 'read', 'books', 'detective', 'work', 'suspect', 'hero', 'may', 'have', 'feet', 'clay.The', 'psychodrama', 'intense', 'Dormer', 'confronted', 'communications', 'killer', 'nemesis', 'Walter', 'Finch', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'suspicions', 'swirl', 'death', 'partner', 'Add', 'inability', 'get', 'sleep', 'Alaska', 'perpetual', 'daylight', 'have', 'man', 'driven', 'absolute', 'brink.Nolan', 'excellent', 'job', 'shooting', 'film', 'editing', 'psychological', 'tension', 'cinematography', 'also', 'superb', 'aided', 'majesctic', 'Alaskan', 'British', 'Columbian', 'locations', 'interaction', 'Dormer', 'Finch', 'unlikely', 'symbiotic', 'relationship', 'fascinating', 'Nolan', 'psychological', 'tingle', 'can', 'be', 'wrung', 'it.Pacino', 'masterful', 'insomniac', 'cop', 'who', 'made', 'certain', 'ethical', 'compromises', 'career', 'name', 'justice', 'so', 'terrible', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'purposely', 'depriving', 'sleep', 'increase', 'realism', 'character', 'Pacino', 'Dormer', 'interesting', 'play', 'latin', 'dormire', 'quot', 'sleep', 'quot', 'dormer', 'window', 'sleeping', 'room', 'hard', 'edge', 'gradually', 'more', 'sleep', 'deprived', 'blurring', 'distinction', 'good', 'evil.Robin', 'Williams', 'be', 'trying', 'shed', 'nice', 'guy', 'image', 'back', 'back', 'wackos', 'up', 'sociopathic', 'performance', 'quot', '1', 'Hour', 'Photo', 'quot', 'character', 'who', 'sort', 'sinister', 'pragmatist', 'Williams', 'best', 'when', 'pushing', 'sanity', 'limits', 'be', 'zany', 'comedy', 'maniacal', 'mayhem', 'precisely', 'why', 'was', 'wrong', 'part', 'character', 'far', 'too', 'calculating', 'controlled', 'Williams', 'talents', 'part', 'was', 'also', 'much', 'too', 'physical', 'just', 'not', 'convincing', 'cold', 'blooded', 'killer', 'tough', 'guy', 'not', 'say', 'was', 'bad', 'performance', 'just', 'wrong', 'actor', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'unfortunately', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'do', 'film', 'dominated', 'Pacino', 'Williams.This', 'excellent', 'big', 'budget', 'debut', 'Nolan', 'terrific', 'performance', 'Pacino', 'suspense', 'pace', 'are', 'first', 'rate', 'contrivances', 'rated', '8/10', 'Definitely', 'not', 'snoozer']",Insomnia Region 2

Al Pacino looked absolutely terrible, and his behavior appeared to be worse than that. Robin Williams as a killer? Give me a break! If Mrs. Doubtfire was a stretch, this was just bizarre! The only way I was going to see Insomnia was to laugh even harder than I had at the trailer. And then the reviews started coming in, and those who watch movies for a living really liked this film. Now I had to go see it just to see who was right. The reviewers were right, I was wrong, and someone should burn the trailer footage.I didn't see Momento, and I didn't see the original Insomnia; I have nothing with which to compare this version of Insomnia. I am an Al Pacino fan, and I have to say that I think his performance in this movie is everything I've come to expect from him. I also thought Robin Williams pulled off the killer persona much better than I ever would have believed he could. Hillary Swank was also very good as the newbie cop in awe of Pacino's celebrity as a cop.I also like mysteries, and I enjoy police procedurals. I enjoy reading or watching explanations about how evidence is gathered and conclusions based on that information are made. I thought the scene in the morgue with Pacino's examination of the victim's body was interesting and well done. Maybe none of it was exactly brilliant police work, but it formed the basis for understanding Pacino's thought processes and established him as a well seasoned cop who'd seen plenty of such cases to know where to start looking for clues. It also began the process by which Swank's newbie cop character would begin to learn that thought process and ultimately one-up Pacino with it.There were so many little things about this movie I enjoyed, not the least of which was the whole insomnia angle and how it affects a person's perceptions and reason. The scene of Pacino and Williams running across the logs was well done and scary. The explanation from the innkeeper about who lives in Alaska and why they choose to be there. The victim's best-friend and her boyfriend told volumes about her without her even acting in scenes with those people. The places in which the main characters lived, and the objects with which they surrounded themselves. But what captured me more than that was the breath taking scenery of Alaska. That alone was worth the price of the ticket. If you want to see desolation at its most beautiful,  majestic finest, see Insomnia.It may be that this movie doesn't stand up well against a previous film of Nolan's or that it doesn't deliver as well as the original version. All I know is that for many reasons, I was satisfied with it and entertained by it. Now, I'm going to send a complaint to whoever is in charge of the trailer for Insomnia and suggest he/she be fired.",5,Finally in 2002 - a GOOD movie!,1022544000,"05 28, 2002",2002,2823,"['saw', 'previews', 'Insomnia', 'earlier', 'year', 'howled', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'looked', 'absolutely', 'terrible', 'behavior', 'appeared', 'be', 'worse', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'killer', 'Give', 'break', 'Mrs.', 'Doubtfire', 'was', 'stretch', 'was', 'just', 'bizarre', 'only', 'way', 'was', 'going', 'see', 'Insomnia', 'was', 'laugh', 'even', 'harder', 'had', 'trailer', 'then', 'reviews', 'started', 'coming', 'who', 'watch', 'movies', 'living', 'really', 'liked', 'film', 'Now', 'had', 'go', 'see', 'just', 'see', 'who', 'was', 'right', 'reviewers', 'were', 'right', 'was', 'wrong', 'someone', 'should', 'burn', 'trailer', 'footage.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'Momento', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'original', 'Insomnia', 'have', 'nothing', 'compare', 'version', 'Insomnia', 'am', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'fan', 'have', 'say', 'think', 'performance', 'movie', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'also', 'thought', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'pulled', 'off', 'killer', 'persona', 'much', 'better', 'ever', 'would', 'have', 'believed', 'could', 'Hillary', 'Swank', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'newbie', 'cop', 'awe', 'Pacino', 'celebrity', 'cop.I', 'also', 'mysteries', 'enjoy', 'police', 'procedurals', 'enjoy', 'reading', 'watching', 'explanations', 'how', 'evidence', 'gathered', 'conclusions', 'based', 'information', 'are', 'made', 'thought', 'scene', 'morgue', 'Pacino', 'examination', 'victim', 'body', 'was', 'interesting', 'well', 'done', 'Maybe', 'none', 'was', 'exactly', 'brilliant', 'police', 'work', 'formed', 'basis', 'understanding', 'Pacino', 'thought', 'processes', 'established', 'well', 'seasoned', 'cop', 'who', ""'d"", 'seen', 'plenty', 'such', 'cases', 'know', 'where', 'start', 'looking', 'clues', 'also', 'began', 'process', 'Swank', 'newbie', 'cop', 'character', 'would', 'begin', 'learn', 'thought', 'process', 'ultimately', 'one-up', 'Pacino', 'it.There', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'little', 'things', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'not', 'least', 'was', 'whole', 'insomnia', 'angle', 'how', 'person', 'perceptions', 'reason', 'scene', 'Pacino', 'Williams', 'running', 'logs', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'scary', 'explanation', 'innkeeper', 'who', 'Alaska', 'why', 'choose', 'be', 'there', 'victim', 'best-friend', 'boyfriend', 'told', 'volumes', 'even', 'acting', 'scenes', 'people', 'places', 'main', 'characters', 'lived', 'objects', 'surrounded', 'what', 'captured', 'more', 'was', 'breath', 'taking', 'scenery', 'Alaska', 'alone', 'was', 'worth', 'price', 'ticket', 'want', 'see', 'desolation', 'most', 'beautiful', 'majestic', 'finest', 'see', 'Insomnia.It', 'may', 'be', 'movie', ""n't"", 'stand', 'up', 'well', 'previous', 'film', 'Nolan', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'as', 'well', 'original', 'version', 'know', 'many', 'reasons', 'was', 'satisfied', 'entertained', 'Now', ""'m"", 'going', 'send', 'complaint', 'whoever', 'charge', 'trailer', 'Insomnia', 'suggest', 'he/she', 'be', 'fired']",Insomnia Region 2

It was a police movie, sort of, but the main policeman was Al Pacino, a Los Angeles homicide detective on leave and investigating a murder case in small-town Alaska. The real star of the movie was Alaska. Man, that's a beautiful state and the scenery was excellent! In any case, a young woman was murdered and Pacino was on the perplexing case and was getting nowhere fast. Ultimately, he found a suspect, Robin Williams, and in the chase ended up shooting and killing his own partner. The shooting was not intentional, of course, and he tried to cover it up. Big mistake. The killer suspect had witnessed him doing it and used the info as leverage to keep his own unintentional murder out of the spotlight. Let's just say that the case gets somewhat complicated. Much more complicated than this. Too complicated, in my opinion. It becomes surrealistic. Oh, and the whole matter was further complicated by the high summer season with bright sunlight around the clock and a debilitating case of insomnia suffered by a dreary Pacino. Well, personally, I've been in Fairbanks, Alaska, during the all-day season and I think the movie greatly exaggerated the effects.The acting was quite good by the entire cast, but Pacino stood out. No surprise there. Williams did a good job, but paled next to Pacino, unfortunately. The directing and filming was first rate. I was not overly impressed with quality of the story.

Everything in Insomnia seemed to free out the stereotypes as it's supposed to be. Things of this kind can always be boring and pale if not for atmospheric direction and top-notch performances.Starring three Oscar winners, Insomnia follows its artistic pacing without losing any commercial attraction. Al Pacino, a top favourite of mine, is prominent again as a sleep-losing yet conscionable veteran cop, occasionally losing his mind but never losing his heart. Robin Williams, gives a convincing flick of a devil shielded with a writer's position. He's shrewd and almost controlling before you, yet fragile and vulnerable behind. The only regret is that the character was reduced at it's screenplay level, with only forty minutes screen time. Williams leads the role as a dominant yet also an undercurrent, with a dark impact, which was insinuated in the endless shining set and Al Pacino's progressive sleeplessness.Beyond these two men's insomnia circle, Swank, portrayed an idolizing yet astute enough young cop, timely refreshing you and rightfully-oriented when you are becoming fatigued and confused with the two men's psychological battle. Slightly pale yet still lovable at the same time. Maura Tierney also lends a helping hand as the Hotel manager who sympathises with Pacino's character.Director Chris Nolan covered all these twists with atmospheric directing, not showing off yet blatant which, normally seen in Hollywood thrillers, restrains story-telling and thought-evoking. He delivered a masterpiece which you can see many times without being bored.",5,Great Performances All Round - Will Defnitely Keep You Up,1083542400,"05 3, 2004",2004,1738,"['would', 'never', 'give', 'Insomnia', 'definition', 'thriller', 'yet', 'sunshine', 'set', 'cat-and-rat', 'game', 'yet', 'also', 'rat-jolts-cat', 'cruelty', 'murder', 'line', 'yet', 'faded', 'psycho', 'confusion', 'Everything', 'Insomnia', 'seemed', 'free', 'out', 'stereotypes', 'supposed', 'be', 'Things', 'kind', 'can', 'always', 'be', 'boring', 'pale', 'not', 'atmospheric', 'direction', 'top-notch', 'performances.Starring', 'three', 'Oscar', 'winners', 'Insomnia', 'artistic', 'pacing', 'losing', 'commercial', 'attraction', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'top', 'favourite', 'mine', 'prominent', 'again', 'sleep-losing', 'yet', 'conscionable', 'veteran', 'cop', 'occasionally', 'losing', 'mind', 'never', 'losing', 'heart', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'convincing', 'flick', 'devil', 'shielded', 'writer', 'position', 'shrewd', 'almost', 'controlling', 'yet', 'fragile', 'vulnerable', 'behind', 'only', 'regret', 'character', 'was', 'reduced', 'screenplay', 'level', 'only', 'forty', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', 'Williams', 'role', 'dominant', 'yet', 'also', 'undercurrent', 'dark', 'impact', 'was', 'insinuated', 'endless', 'shining', 'set', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'progressive', 'sleeplessness.Beyond', 'two', 'men', 'insomnia', 'circle', 'Swank', 'portrayed', 'idolizing', 'yet', 'astute', 'enough', 'young', 'cop', 'timely', 'refreshing', 'rightfully-oriented', 'when', 'are', 'becoming', 'fatigued', 'confused', 'two', 'men', 'psychological', 'battle', 'Slightly', 'pale', 'yet', 'still', 'lovable', 'same', 'time', 'Maura', 'Tierney', 'also', 'helping', 'hand', 'Hotel', 'manager', 'who', 'Pacino', 'character.Director', 'Chris', 'Nolan', 'covered', 'twists', 'atmospheric', 'directing', 'not', 'showing', 'off', 'yet', 'blatant', 'normally', 'seen', 'Hollywood', 'thrillers', 'story-telling', 'thought-evoking', 'delivered', 'masterpiece', 'can', 'see', 'many', 'times', 'being', 'bored']",Insomnia Region 2
709255,A23KDYA7YGPEWW,B00006AGHD,Gil,"[2, 2]","While I did not see the original Norwegian version of this film, I intend to do so after reading about it amongst these many great reviews.L.A. Detective Will Dormer (Al Pacino) travels to Alaska with his partner to investigate the murder of a local girl. Not only must Dormer face the daunting task of finding the killer, but he must also cope with the never setting sun, which eventually deprives him from much needed sleep. He also kills his partner by accident, and must also construct a way out of that as well. The movie's location in the beauty and lushness of Alaska make you want to pack up the camper and head there for a month. It really added to the depth of the film, as opposed to it taking place in the ""lower 48"".Once Pacino and his partner arrive at their destination, they are greeted by Detective Ellie Burr (Hillary Swank), who idolizes Dormer. While I felt that this was kind of annoying at first,  it was interesting to see the pivitol point where she transitions from trusting and admiring Dormer to suspecting him of killing his partner. While the chief of police seemed grateful for Dormer's assistance, I  sensed resentment from the other local cops at his presence. It seemed as though they were subconciously saying ""Why bring in an outsider when we are just as capable?"" Nevertheless, the local officers eventually warm up to him and begin to trust and depend on his experience and expertise to catch the killer, played by Robin Williams. While Williams' performance as a villan was not on par with his phenomenal work in ""One Hour Photo"", he still plays his character well. He is the only witness to Dormer's shooting of his partner, and he uses this as psychological leverage throughout the second half of the film.The movie climaxes with Dormer chasing Williams through an old fishing cabin.

Good cop fights 'evil'. 17 year old raped and murdered. Generic psycho ticks. Writers are weirdos. Platitudinized Jungian introversion/extroversion, yet again. 'Quiet' men are all really weirdos, stalkers, sissies, rapists, murders just waiting to snap. That's why they end up 'writing', and there's that old Freudian bourgeois truism, much loved by our liberal Academy for nearly a century, about sublimation and the reality-principle, and I can probably go on a few more lines about all the recalcitrant matter.Now that I think about it, Insomnia could be the high-noon of all these things, which are in a way still remotely related to the contemporary male sex.

709262,ASOJUBRHQI1DW,B00006AGHD,IRA Ross,"[1, 1]","What makes ""Insomnia"" such a compelling film is its painting of the Al Pacino character, a Los Angeles detective, in various shades of gray. Pacino is assisting the police in an Alaska town solve the murder of a young high school woman. His character is complex. There is no doubt that he has been a thoroughly professional, hard working and determined man throughout his career. However, he is also a haunted man. Pacino's character, Detective Dormer, is under investigation concerning some allegedly unprofessional conduct concerning evidence in an earlier murder case. To add to his woes, during his work on the current case he does something horrendous, perhaps accidentally, while he and his partner are chasing the possible culprit.Al Pacino gives a wonderful and sympathetic performance as the weary and very troubled detective. Interestingly, his character's name, Dormer, means ""to sleep"" in French. Robin Williams gives a realistically creepy performance as the mystery writer with whom the dead woman had gotten perhaps too involved. Williams, who is often over-the-top in his other movie roles, here underplays his part, which helps to give his character the right sense of eerieness. Hilary Swank plays a young rookie detective assisting in the investigation with all the Nancy Drew enthusiasm that the part requires.During the film, Pacino's Detective Dormer tells the Swank character, perhaps mirroring his own situation, what distinguishes a good cop from a bad cop. When a good cop can't sleep it is probably because a piece of the murder puzzle is still missing; when a bad cop can't sleep, he is probably feeling guilty about something.

Unluckily things are moving slightly differently. And the result will be a whole slate of dead bodies. There definitely is some suspense in all that. We are constantly wondering what the criminal or the cop are going to do to trap each other and we are in for quite a few surprises. Good entertainment even if it is not a masterpiece. No psychological depth, no social dimension, no symbolical power, just a cat and a mouse playing together and we of course never know who the cat is, not to speak of the mouse.

Christal,"[4, 5]","Ok, that might sound like a cliche line for Insomnia, a remake here of the 1997 foreign version with Stellan Skarsgard, but why not once in a blue moon. Anyway, this is indeed a topper for Christopher Nolan, over his 2001 independent backwards episode Memento, and brings his storytelling skills to a thriller set in Alaska. Thus, Al Pacino plays the cop, a usual part to be sure, yet here brings an excellent feeling of desperation to try and find a way out of the muck of lies and torment that are in his life. And for once, Alaska is shown as it truly is, either all night or all day (there are so many movies that get this wrong it's too lengthy to explain here) and how either one can drive the particular person crazed. Here it is the constant shining of a itty bit of sunlight into his room at 3:30 AM.Pacino is on the case of a killer (Robin Williams) who's victim is a teenage girl. This is handled in a good way, by turning it into not a cops and and bad guys movie, but more of a moral movie, one about getting caught in the most stressful of situations in dealing with control over life and the responsibility it follows. It is not just the acting, which is above par, but also just the downright craft that drags you into the predominately first person dilemma (although Williams brings up some interesting points among his blackmail).One more note: Williams has done something this year to me I'm not sure he's ever done- he has two movies from this year that are both grand dramatic, crazed performances and among his flops and utter misdemeanors (including another one he did this year, Death to Smoochy) there is a bit of praise for the guy.

709269,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B00006AGHD,J from NY,"[0, 0]","2002's ""Insomnia"" is one of the most quietly melancholy American movies I've ever seen--all the characters (with the exception of Hillary Swank's annoyingly idealistic female detective Ellie Burr) are somehow grimy and have something to hide.Robin Williams plays a really good creep.  ""One Hour Photo"" was a movie with a lot of potential that ultimately went nowhere, but he sure makes up for it here as the effeminate failed writer and murderer of a 17 year old girl. Williams successfully underplays the role of a neurotic psychopath (Walter Finch) whose pathos we see emerge in the smallest and most pivotal moments, thereby making them even more disturbing.The cinematography is damn near perfect--the Alaskan wilderness is a perfect backdrop for Det Will Dormer's (Al Pacino) psychological meltdown and inability to sleep.  The time zone and his entire life is closing in on him slowly: a previous investigation in which he planted evidence to convict another child killer is beginning to catch up with him.  On top of this, his younger partner (Martin Donovan) is forced to make a deal with internal affairs about the matter.  As if things could get worse, he accidentally shoots and kills him in a foggy gun battle where Finch is lurking.He is then forced to sink so low as to collaborate with Finch himself, who orchestrated the incident precisely for control of not only his fate but Dormer's.  The whole theme of dishonesty, even in the service of a just cause, gracefully winds around Dormer's neck like a noose.  The ending is as devastating as the entire film, with Swank's character given  the hope of redemption out of all this corruption.

But with nothing else to do on a 14-hour business-class flight from Chicago to Tokyo, I decided I might as well give it a try. If it bored me, I could always turn the channel to the satellite view of the airplane's flight path. I was happy to see the film's setting was one of my favorite places on earth--Alaska. But I was also nervous. Would Hollywood do a hatchet job on small town Alaska as it does the rest of small town America? To my surprise, ""Insomnia"" was a realistic portrayal of small town Alaskan life. It shows that even in Alaska, there are modern, state-of-the-art police technology, and people have cars and them thar real big picture box contraptions. Wow! Did the scriptwriter actually leave his mansion and notice a world beyond the Santa Monica hills? Al Pacino plays a Los Angeles detective who arrives in Alaska to help with a local murder investigation. His performance, as expected, is intense. As it turns out, he volunteered for the Alaska assignment to escape controversy in Los Angeles. Although his character is flawed, I found myself rooting for him to overcome those flaws. The murder mystery intensifies as does the mystery surrounding Pacino's character. The local police trust his judgment, but they sense something just isn't quite right with him, especially one police woman who is suspicious of his motives. What happened back in Los Angeles? The action is suspenseful, the setting inspiring.

709272,A1Q0UFY6YKH3V,B00006AGHD,Jon Eric Davidson,"[5, 5]","Having seen the 1997 Norwegian film of the same name, I was eager to see how the American-ized version of ""Insomnia"" would play out.  Without delving too far into the comparisons that have been thoroughly detailed in prior reviews, I will say that this is one of the finer examples of how to film a remake.This version of ""Insomnia"" takes place in a remote Alaskan port city, and revolves around the murder of a young girl.  However, as the movie unfolds, the murder slowly becomes only a small piece of a much more expansive, provoking, intense character drama.From a cinematographical perspective, the haunting beauty of Alaska is captured perfectly.  In a way unique when compared to other films, the landscape is intertwined with the plot, further exposing the loneliness and isolation, while paradoxically highlighting its stark contrast with murder, death, and psychological demons.  The sequence of the hunt/shooting amidst a thick, impenetrable fog is riveting and conveys a high level of tension, as the viewer shares in the disorientation the fog creates.""Insomnia"" is driven by characters and acting, and a strong cast is assembled.  Al Pacino - as expected - is wonderful in his portrayal of the world-weary city cop who escapes an Internal Affairs investigation by coming to investigate this murder.  In many ways, we have seen Mr. Pacino in this role on numerous occasion, and he demonstrates this with the comfortable ease in which he carries his role.  However, as his sleep-deprivation - caused by the long hours of daylight - intensifies, Mr. Pacino takes his character to a remarkable next level, as he battles to cover his questionable investigative practices and battle the psychological demons tied to similar practices in cases being investigated by Internal Affairs back in Los Angeles.  As a viewer, you can empathize with his character, while at the same time watch in amazement as he struggles to keep himself from completely unraveling.Robin Williams is equally strong as the author-turned-murderer.  Like Mr. Pacino, we have seen Mr. Williams in roles similar to this, and yet he is so good at pulling it off that you couldn't see any other person carrying such a role.  His quiet, brooding character is psychologically scary; one senses that a violent, psychotic rage is bubbling just beneath his placid exterior.  Also, Mr. Williams uses his comedic facial reactions to maximize the creepiness of his character.  A couple of times he flashes a muted smile that subtly conveys the twisted pleasure he has in his cat-and-mouse game with Mr. Pacino's character.  He is subdued, but brilliant, in this role.Hilary Swank also shines as the young, impressionable cop who ultimately uncovers Mr. Pacino's attempts to cover up the accidental shooting of his partner.  She wonderfully evolves from one overcome with ""hero-worship"" in working with Mr. Pacino's character to one disheartened and mildly angry when she finds that her ""idol"" isn't who he is cracked up to be.  Ms. Swank more than adequately holds her own in sharing the screen with Mr. Pacino and Mr. Williams, which is no small feat.The climatic ending to the film is perhaps slightly cliched in its quick tying up of loose storylines, but it plays well here.  In its progression, you weren't quite sure how things were going to be resolved after the teenage suspect is arrested (falsely) for murder.  One would almost have the sense that the movie could have ended with several loose ends hanging, allowing the viewer to ponder the outcome.  But, there was instead the dramatic shootout, which ultimately was a satisfying resolution and conclusion to the film.All told, ""Insomnia"" was a very solid, quiet, tense drama that is worth the time to see.  I give it a four-star rating, and recommend it to anyone seeking a good character-driven movie that is free of overwhelming special effects and action sequences.  People seeking a fast-paced drama might want to steer clear, as they might find the pacing of this film to be too slow for their tastes.",4,"A satisfyingly tense, character-driven drama",1043107200,"01 21, 2003",2003,4036,"['Having', 'seen', '1997', 'Norwegian', 'film', 'same', 'name', 'was', 'eager', 'see', 'how', 'American-ized', 'version', 'Insomnia', 'would', 'play', 'out', 'delving', 'too', 'far', 'comparisons', 'have', 'been', 'thoroughly', 'detailed', 'prior', 'reviews', 'will', 'say', 'one', 'finer', 'examples', 'how', 'film', 'remake.This', 'version', 'Insomnia', 'place', 'remote', 'Alaskan', 'port', 'city', 'around', 'murder', 'young', 'girl', 'However', 'movie', 'unfolds', 'murder', 'slowly', 'only', 'small', 'piece', 'much', 'more', 'expansive', 'provoking', 'intense', 'character', 'cinematographical', 'perspective', 'haunting', 'beauty', 'Alaska', 'captured', 'perfectly', 'way', 'unique', 'when', 'compared', 'other', 'films', 'landscape', 'intertwined', 'plot', 'further', 'exposing', 'loneliness', 'isolation', 'paradoxically', 'highlighting', 'stark', 'contrast', 'murder', 'death', 'psychological', 'demons', 'sequence', 'hunt/shooting', 'thick', 'impenetrable', 'fog', 'riveting', 'conveys', 'high', 'level', 'tension', 'viewer', 'shares', 'disorientation', 'fog', 'Insomnia', 'driven', 'characters', 'acting', 'strong', 'cast', 'assembled', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'expected', 'wonderful', 'portrayal', 'world-weary', 'city', 'cop', 'who', 'Internal', 'Affairs', 'investigation', 'coming', 'investigate', 'murder', 'many', 'ways', 'have', 'seen', 'Mr.', 'Pacino', 'role', 'numerous', 'occasion', 'comfortable', 'ease', 'role', 'However', 'sleep-deprivation', 'caused', 'long', 'hours', 'daylight', 'intensifies', 'Mr.', 'Pacino', 'character', 'remarkable', 'next', 'level', 'cover', 'questionable', 'investigative', 'practices', 'battle', 'psychological', 'demons', 'tied', 'similar', 'practices', 'cases', 'being', 'investigated', 'Internal', 'Affairs', 'back', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'viewer', 'can', 'empathize', 'character', 'same', 'time', 'watch', 'amazement', 'keep', 'completely', 'unraveling.Robin', 'Williams', 'equally', 'strong', 'author-turned-murderer', 'Mr.', 'Pacino', 'have', 'seen', 'Mr.', 'Williams', 'roles', 'similar', 'yet', 'so', 'good', 'pulling', 'off', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'other', 'person', 'carrying', 'role', 'quiet', 'brooding', 'character', 'psychologically', 'scary', 'one', 'violent', 'psychotic', 'rage', 'bubbling', 'just', 'beneath', 'placid', 'exterior', 'Also', 'Mr.', 'Williams', 'comedic', 'facial', 'reactions', 'maximize', 'creepiness', 'character', 'couple', 'times', 'muted', 'smile', 'subtly', 'twisted', 'pleasure', 'cat-and-mouse', 'game', 'Mr.', 'Pacino', 'character', 'subdued', 'brilliant', 'role.Hilary', 'Swank', 'also', 'young', 'impressionable', 'cop', 'who', 'ultimately', 'Mr.', 'Pacino', 'attempts', 'cover', 'up', 'accidental', 'shooting', 'partner', 'wonderfully', 'one', 'overcome', 'hero-worship', 'working', 'Mr.', 'Pacino', 'character', 'one', 'disheartened', 'mildly', 'angry', 'when', 'idol', ""n't"", 'who', 'cracked', 'up', 'be', 'Ms.', 'Swank', 'more', 'adequately', 'own', 'sharing', 'screen', 'Mr.', 'Pacino', 'Mr.', 'Williams', 'small', 'feat.The', 'climatic', 'ending', 'film', 'perhaps', 'slightly', 'cliched', 'quick', 'tying', 'loose', 'storylines', 'well', 'here', 'progression', 'were', ""n't"", 'quite', 'sure', 'how', 'things', 'were', 'going', 'be', 'resolved', 'teenage', 'suspect', 'arrested', 'falsely', 'murder', 'One', 'would', 'almost', 'have', 'sense', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'ended', 'several', 'loose', 'ends', 'hanging', 'allowing', 'viewer', 'ponder', 'outcome', 'was', 'instead', 'dramatic', 'shootout', 'ultimately', 'was', 'satisfying', 'resolution', 'conclusion', 'film.All', 'told', 'Insomnia', 'was', 'very', 'solid', 'quiet', 'tense', 'drama', 'time', 'see', 'give', 'four-star', 'rating', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'seeking', 'good', 'character-driven', 'movie', 'free', 'overwhelming', 'special', 'effects', 'action', 'sequences', 'People', 'seeking', 'fast-paced', 'drama', 'might', 'want', 'steer', 'clear', 'might', 'find', 'pacing', 'film', 'be', 'too', 'slow', 'tastes']",Insomnia Region 2

It was definitely not your typical Hollywood movie, but, at the same time, was not as memorable as Memento.As far as the remake of the earlier ""Insomnia"" goes, it's well done, but almost seems unnecessary.  They were equally good-the major difference being that this version seemed to draw out the themes of the earlier one, which was more subtle (for better or for worse).  I'm not great at articulating exactly what I think about it, but I don't think you can make a qualitative comparison between the two.  They're just approached a little differently, and either one could be more to your liking.

To Christopher Nolan's credit, after making the incredibly confusing ""Memento"", he chose to make a more straight-forward mystery thrill ride and the move pays off big time.""Insomnia"" tells the story of LAPD detective Dormer (Al Pacino) who along with his partner, are sent up to Alaska to solve a startling murder of a teenage girl in a small quiet town.  The cops of this small town aren't sure what precipitated this murder, and they're not sure about the odd circumstances that surround the two LAPD detectives presence here, other than Dormer is a friend of the town's chief of police.  Things quickly get out of hand when a tip is given, as to the perpetrator's possible location, and a friendly fire accident leaves Dormer's partner dead and Dormer to blame for the shooting.  Things are only complicated further when the killer is the witness to the accidental shooting and knows that Dormer is trying to cover it up, because the reason LAPD sent them to Alaska, besides assisting in a murder investigation, was to get them away from Internal Affairs, and a ""friendly-fire"" altercation would seem greatly suspicious.  To top things off, it's the time of year in Alaska when there is constant sunlight, leaving Det. Dormer suffering from insomnia, and growing increasingly withdrawn and somewhat crazy.  With all of that occurring the killer chooses to use Dormer's guilt and cover-up as leverage in assisting him in placing the guilt of this small town girl's murder on someone else letting him off the hook.""Insomnia"" is superbly acted and directed, with stand-out performances by Al Pacino (no surprise there), Robin Williams, and Hillary Swank.

In fact, the tension runs so high that even after the credits roll by, the last thing you'll be thinking about is your bed.  Most likely, what you will be doing is trying to remember the last time you saw a thriller this good, this exciting and this effective at putting you inside the uncomfortable position of its main character.  Christopher Nolan's follow-up to the fantastic MEMENTO is as tight a production as they come, featuring three Academy Award winners, an out-of-sight landscape, and a story that will tingle and scrape at more of you nerve endings than a visit to a bad dentist.Pacino and Hilary Swank display tremendous chemistry as the veteran cop and the youngster who admires him, pairing up to solve both the initial murder and another more mysterious crime that comes along and blows the case wide open.  Thankfully, Pacino plays a more subdued character than his usually more agitated self and as for Swank, it was nice to see her with some meat on her bones, looking good and putting up a great performance.  Whilst I hardly consider myself a fan of Robin Williams, even I have to say that he was perfect as an offbeat author from a neighboring town.  It's a very character and plot driven movie and these three drove it home in style. The surrounding cast also followed their lead in playing the local cops and townspeople, with a special nod going to the delightful Maura Tierney who plays the town hotelier.It was pretty cool to see Pacino in this setting. We're not used to seeing him in a small town with snow and grass since he's usually playing characters in New York or LA.  which was another northern murder mystery featuring cops dealing in environments in which they were not familiar.  It was actually quite refreshing and very satisfying to see this perspective on Pacino.

Yet they grow old, and sometimes we long for something different. And the different can be refreshing when it works. But it also comes with a greater risk of failure. When it does fail, as it often does, it can have us longing for the old formulaic stuff all over again. Here's a case in point of something definitely not formulaic, aiming perhaps to be refreshing, and expecting credit for the effort alone. But the effort, alas is wasted. Al Pacino plays a Los Angeles cop, sent north to investigate a baffling murder case -- far north, in fact, to Alaska. It must be midsummer because he encounters the midnight sun in Alaska, and the absence of darkness leads to the title condition. He chases a murder suspect and in the chase his partner is fatally shot. In the folowing daze it's all a blur. Was his partner shot by the suspect or by Pacino's character himself? If the latter, was it purposeful or an accident? If purposeful, he could have had a motive, because he ain't entirely a clean cop by any means and his partner was in a position to turn him in to internal afairs back in L.A. But the fog and his sleepless state make it all a blur. Then the suspect starts to taunt him about his possible culpability for his partner's death. The suspect seems to confess to killing the original murder victim, but claims it was an accident, calling himself no more guilty than the cop he's taunting and blackmailing. The latter's sleepless daze starts to rub off onto the audience as the taunting is prolonged: seems we're expected to buy into the daze and puzzle over who's guilty of what and whether anybody's really blameless. Did I mention there's a subplot involving the original victim's boyfriend? He's accused of having abused her, but guess what - that's just one more question that turns into a blur, and who knows what to believe about what. We expect all these questions to be resolved. But don't expect too much. It's more like the blur drags on until we cease to care about the answers. Without scarcely anything else resolved, the ending finally comes with a missed opportunity for a surprise. The surprise opportunity would seem obvious, but the movie just ends without hinting whether the makers even thought of that obvious opportunity or not.",2,Quirky characters and story add up mainly to a misfire,1029369600,"08 15, 2002",2002,2431,"['old', 'formulas', 'movies', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'things', 'are', 'sometimes', 'called', 'tried', 'true', 'are', 'fact', 'time-tested', 'proven', 'good', 'bets', 'what', 'do', 'grow', 'old', 'sometimes', 'long', 'something', 'different', 'different', 'can', 'be', 'refreshing', 'when', 'also', 'greater', 'risk', 'failure', 'When', 'fail', 'often', 'can', 'have', 'longing', 'old', 'formulaic', 'stuff', 'over', 'again', 'Here', 'case', 'point', 'something', 'definitely', 'not', 'formulaic', 'aiming', 'perhaps', 'be', 'refreshing', 'expecting', 'credit', 'effort', 'alone', 'effort', 'wasted', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'cop', 'sent', 'north', 'investigate', 'baffling', 'murder', 'case', 'far', 'north', 'fact', 'Alaska', 'must', 'be', 'midsummer', 'midnight', 'sun', 'Alaska', 'absence', 'darkness', 'leads', 'title', 'condition', 'murder', 'suspect', 'chase', 'partner', 'fatally', 'shot', 'folowing', 'blur', 'Was', 'partner', 'shot', 'suspect', 'Pacino', 'character', 'latter', 'was', 'purposeful', 'accident', 'purposeful', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'motive', 'ai', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'clean', 'cop', 'means', 'partner', 'was', 'position', 'turn', 'internal', 'afairs', 'back', 'L.A', 'fog', 'sleepless', 'state', 'make', 'blur', 'Then', 'suspect', 'taunt', 'possible', 'culpability', 'partner', 'death', 'suspect', 'confess', 'killing', 'original', 'murder', 'victim', 'claims', 'was', 'accident', 'calling', 'more', 'guilty', 'cop', 'taunting', 'blackmailing', 'latter', 'sleepless', 'daze', 'rub', 'off', 'audience', 'taunting', 'prolonged', ""'re"", 'expected', 'buy', 'daze', 'puzzle', 'who', 'guilty', 'what', 'anybody', 'really', 'blameless', 'Did', 'mention', 'subplot', 'involving', 'original', 'victim', 'boyfriend', 'accused', 'having', 'abused', 'guess', 'what', 'just', 'one', 'more', 'question', 'blur', 'who', 'what', 'believe', 'what', 'expect', 'questions', 'be', 'resolved', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'more', 'blur', 'cease', 'care', 'answers', 'scarcely', 'anything', 'else', 'resolved', 'ending', 'finally', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'surprise', 'surprise', 'opportunity', 'would', 'seem', 'obvious', 'movie', 'just', 'hinting', 'makers', 'even', 'thought', 'obvious', 'opportunity', 'not']",Insomnia Region 2

Dormer sufers from insomnia, due to the ever-present sunlight in the Alaskan summer; his nerves are frayed, he's strung-out, and he makes a big mistake.  He accidently kills a police officer, and blames the murderer.  That story would probably work except for one thing:  the girl's killer saw him do it.Pacino is outstanding as the morally conflicted cop who can't sleep.  Swank is good as the eager-beaver young cop who must deal with her own issues of right and wrong.  The weak link in the cast is Robin Williams, who plays the murderer, Finch.  We know he can be genuinely creepy, as he was inOne Hour Photo.  It's too bad he didn't bring some of that spine-tingling excitement to this role.  He is much too low-key, comfortable, and cheerful.  The movie lacks suspense of any kind, due to Williams' nice-guy bad-guy.  Fans of Al Pacino will enjoy his profoundly moving performance, but those hoping for edge-of-your-seat suspense will be disappointed.",3,Pacino is great,1061596800,"08 23, 2003",2003,1116,"['Al', 'Pacino', 'Dormer', 'LA', 'detective', 'assignment', 'remote', 'Alaska', 'there', 'help', 'local', 'cop', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'find', 'killer', 'teenage', 'girl', 'Dormer', 'sufers', 'insomnia', 'due', 'ever-present', 'sunlight', 'Alaskan', 'summer', 'nerves', 'are', 'frayed', 'strung-out', 'big', 'mistake', 'accidently', 'police', 'officer', 'murderer', 'story', 'would', 'probably', 'work', 'one', 'thing', 'girl', 'killer', 'saw', 'do', 'it.Pacino', 'outstanding', 'morally', 'conflicted', 'cop', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sleep', 'Swank', 'good', 'eager-beaver', 'young', 'cop', 'who', 'must', 'deal', 'own', 'issues', 'right', 'wrong', 'weak', 'link', 'cast', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'who', 'murderer', 'Finch', 'know', 'can', 'be', 'genuinely', 'creepy', 'was', 'inOne', 'Hour', 'Photo', 'too', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'bring', 'spine-tingling', 'excitement', 'role', 'much', 'too', 'low-key', 'comfortable', 'cheerful', 'movie', 'suspense', 'kind', 'due', 'Williams', 'nice-guy', 'bad-guy', 'Fans', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'will', 'enjoy', 'profoundly', 'moving', 'performance', 'hoping', 'edge-of-your-seat', 'suspense', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed']",Insomnia Region 2

Ross ""Kristy""","[0, 1]","Christopher Nolan's follow-up to MEMENTO is a more straight-forward thriller which serves as both an excellent tour-de-force of suspense in terrific form and re-establishment of Robin Williams' serious acting roles. But the main guy here is of course, the great Al Pacino, who gives another fantatsically compelling performance. The story, basically, is centered around Pacino hunting down a serial killer on the loose (Williams). Hey, at least Williams is breaking away from his &quot;funnyman&quot; sterotype and proves, at least with this, that he can be serious and still bring the same commanding M.O to any character on film. Hillary Swank also provides impressive supporting energy, helped with a sharp script. Not surprisingly, the score, very important addition in this genre, is a fantastic blend of slighty etheral tracks with downbeat percussions building up the tension. Director Nolan, having proven his coup-de-grace with the intracate stylistic MEMENTO, here works in more familiar action territory. That's not to say that the film is bereft of twists however, for there are numerous shockers and suprises along the way. A terrific film, and a must have on DVD.Speaking of which, the DVD extra features are fantastic, with an interesting commentary by director Christopher Nolan, commentary by actor Hilary Swank, production designer Nathan Crowley, editor Dody Dorn, cinematograher Wally Pfister, and screenwriter Hillary Seitz, additional scene with commentary the doco &quot;Day for Night&quot; making of documentary, &quot;180 Degrees&quot;: A Conversation with Christopher Nolan and Al Pacino, &quot;In the Fog&quot;: Cinematography and production design and &quot;Eyes Wide Open&quot;: The insomniac's world.

709288,A16X61RLY1YJL7,B00006AGHD,"K. Wyatt ""ssintrepid""","[0, 2]","I would definitely have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by the high quality of this suspense/thriller/detective story.  ""Insomnia"" scores on all hits insofar as plot development, direction, acting and overall suspense.  I've watched a lot of Al Pacino's films over the years and I'd have to say that ""Insomnia"" is probably his best film in some time.  When you sit down to watch one of his films, you're usually guaranteed of one thing, Al Pacino in a movie with a different name, his portrayals are usually pretty similar.  This is not the case with ""Insomnia,"" which I believe is inherent to the fact that he had to play a famous detective from LA that is brought onto a case in Nightmute, Alaska and guess what, it daytime all day, and he's having a problem sleeping, due to both the all day daylight and a ""slight"" conscience problem.Beyond Al Pacino's stellar performance in ""Insomnia"" there is Robin Williams and Hilary Swank, all three being Academy Award winners.  When one prepares to watch a film with Robin Williams in it, there is either going to be either humor that will take your breath away or an exceptional dramatic performance, which is what he delivers in ""Insomnia.""  The ever beautiful Hilary Swank is right on with her performance as the somewhat ""star struck"" local detective, assigned to assist Al Pacino's character.As a follow up to his directorial debut in ""Memento,"" director Christopher Nolan delivers brilliantly in ""Insomnia"" and his future films are to be looked forward to.The premise:LAPD Detective Will Dormer (Al Pacino) is called in to investigate the murder of a local in Nightmute, Alaska.  Upon arrival and being met by Hilary Swank's character, he immediately views the remains of the murder victim, a young high school girl whose been beaten to death.  With the investigation started, he soon learns of the ever shining ""midnight"" sun during this time of year in Alaska and he soon learns of his partners intentions with reference to his affairs back in LA.  Take the already palpable tension between he and his partner, a stakeout where their hoping to catch the killer and fog off of a lake and here you have an exceptional psychological thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end.I highly recommend this film to any and all fans of this genre.  {ssintrepid}Special Features:- Additional Scenes- Commentary by Director Christopher Nolan- Commentary by Hilary Swank, Production Designer Nathan Crowley, Editor Dody Dorn, Cinematographer Wally Pfister and Screenwriter Hillary SeitzFeaturettes:- Day for Night:  Making of Documentary- 180:  A Conversation with Christopher Nolan and Al Pacino- In the Fog:  Cinematography and Production Design- Eyes Wide Open:  The Insomniac's WorldAdditional special features:  Stills Gallery; Interactive Menus; Theatrical Trailer; Cast/Crew Film Highlights and Scene Access",5,Insomnia - A superb psychological thriller!,1059609600,"07 31, 2003",2003,2889,"['would', 'definitely', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'high', 'quality', 'suspense/thriller/detective', 'story', 'Insomnia', 'scores', 'hits', 'insofar', 'plot', 'development', 'direction', 'acting', 'overall', 'suspense', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'lot', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'films', 'years', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'Insomnia', 'probably', 'best', 'film', 'time', 'When', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'one', 'films', ""'re"", 'usually', 'guaranteed', 'one', 'thing', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'movie', 'different', 'name', 'portrayals', 'are', 'usually', 'pretty', 'similar', 'not', 'case', 'Insomnia', 'believe', 'inherent', 'fact', 'had', 'play', 'famous', 'detective', 'LA', 'brought', 'case', 'Nightmute', 'Alaska', 'guess', 'what', 'day', 'having', 'problem', 'sleeping', 'due', 'day', 'daylight', 'slight', 'conscience', 'problem.Beyond', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'stellar', 'performance', 'Insomnia', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'three', 'being', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winners', 'When', 'one', 'watch', 'film', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'going', 'be', 'either', 'humor', 'will', 'take', 'breath', 'away', 'exceptional', 'dramatic', 'performance', 'what', 'Insomnia', 'ever', 'beautiful', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'right', 'performance', 'somewhat', 'star', 'struck', 'local', 'detective', 'assigned', 'assist', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'character.As', 'follow', 'up', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Memento', 'director', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'brilliantly', 'Insomnia', 'future', 'films', 'are', 'be', 'looked', 'forward', 'to.The', 'premise', 'LAPD', 'Detective', 'Will', 'Dormer', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'called', 'investigate', 'murder', 'local', 'Nightmute', 'Alaska', 'arrival', 'being', 'met', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'character', 'immediately', 'remains', 'murder', 'victim', 'young', 'high', 'school', 'girl', 'been', 'beaten', 'death', 'investigation', 'started', 'soon', 'ever', 'shining', 'midnight', 'sun', 'time', 'year', 'Alaska', 'soon', 'partners', 'intentions', 'reference', 'affairs', 'back', 'LA', 'Take', 'already', 'palpable', 'tension', 'partner', 'stakeout', 'where', 'hoping', 'catch', 'killer', 'fog', 'off', 'lake', 'here', 'have', 'exceptional', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'will', 'keep', 'edge', 'seat', 'very', 'end.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'fans', 'genre', 'ssintrepid', 'Special', 'Features', 'Additional', 'Scenes-', 'Commentary', 'Director', 'Christopher', 'Nolan-', 'Commentary', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'Production', 'Designer', 'Nathan', 'Crowley', 'Editor', 'Dody', 'Dorn', 'Cinematographer', 'Wally', 'Pfister', 'Screenwriter', 'Hillary', 'Day', 'Night', 'Making', 'Documentary-', '180', 'Conversation', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'Al', 'Pacino-', 'Fog', 'Cinematography', 'Production', 'Design-', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Open', 'Insomniac', 'WorldAdditional', 'special', 'features', 'Stills', 'Gallery', 'Interactive', 'Menus', 'Theatrical', 'Trailer', 'Cast/Crew', 'Film', 'Highlights', 'Scene', 'Access']",Insomnia Region 2

When it turns bad, it's sand in your face mixed with thorns and poison ivy.The first half, about an hour, lives up to all expectations. Cinematography, acting, the tightness of dialogue, the sense of expectation and anticipation of--what?, the minimalism of the acting. This is true except for one scene between Pacino and his co-cop, which felt like ""acting,"" which was all exposition (probably important), but which made my mind wander. Other than that, couldn't be better. I was also pretty sure the Maura Tierney character would turn out to be either the murderer or a crucial link.Then the screenwriter or director or both did something gutsy. After the midpoint, about halfway through, when, normally, no new characters ""should"" be introduced (screenwriting formula), a major new character was indeed introduced. Good for them. Rule-breaking is always terrific. If it works.From then, the film decayed into complicated twists and details, chases, melodrama. I suspected that Hollywood people had all sat around saying, Let's spice it up Let's try this and Let's try this and Let's try this. And the writer tried them all and included them all and the second half is garbage. Unbearably complicated, as against complex. The writer threw in so much ""stuff"" that the plot could have gone anywhere, thus leaving the thoughtful viewer out in the cold. Not fair.Too bad, because this was, for a while and at the end, a great Pacino performance. However, Hillary Swank had nothing to do, nor did Nicky Katt (BOILER ROOM, ""Boston Public"") and were wasted. They also acted as if they were not sure who their characters were. Neither was I. It was not their fault. A good actor can surmount anything but a forceful director who screws them up which this director did.Robin Williams, also a fine dramatic actor, seemed confused about his role and his closeups made me wonder less about the character, and more about why he goes on Jay Leno's show acting the clown and denying his serious side.

I mention this simply because most of my conversations about this film have started like this: ""What did you think of Insomnia?"" And the answer would go something like, ""It was good, but not as good as Memento."" Well I don't think that is fair to this film, the performers, or, in particular, Christopher Nolan. Memento is an exceptional film, if not a great film. If Nolan had tried to plug his Memento formula into his next project we would have got another Jackie Brown, I prefer Insomnia. So what do I think? Insomnia is a studio film (a good one at that), a step in the right direction, and it has Al Pacino (The MAN).Disclaimer: Please read someone else's review for a plot summary. I'm not going to spoil, but I just want to talk about why I like it. So, why I like it. Well first, and most certainly foremost, this is first rate filmmaking. Christopher Nolan is a star. Momento was brilliant on several levels, but it was a gimic picture to a certain extent (see it if you haven't). By this rational it is also an innovative film, but that separates it from Insomnia, they shouldn't be compared. However Nolan puts his stamp on Insomnia, much like he did Momento, i.e. Nolan is a unique talant, not a pan in the wash. His pacing is masterful, his visual style is purposeful and consistent, his story is engaging, and he has Al Pacino.Al Pacino. He hasn't been on the screen since Any Given Movie and it was well worth the wait. This DVD has a unique feature on the commentary track. The commentary follows the shooting schedule instead of the narrative. This allows the audience to see how Pacino works. It is a great special feature, as good as any I've seen. It goes without saying that Pacino is an amazing actor, but to be able to see how he evolves and molds his character is such a gift. Watch how the camera envades his personal space, watch how Pacino embraces it. I thought he was excellent in this film. The other heavies are good, but this is Pacino's movie. He carries it.One last thing, the daylight in this film. Nolan has made a dark film in constant light.

709294,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B00006AGHD,Linda Linguvic,"[2, 2]","Al Pacino, cast in the role of an aging Los Angeles detective, is sent to Alaska to solve a murder case.  He's also there to distance himself from an Internal Affairs Investigation going on in which his partner, played by Martin Donovan, is going to testify against him.  The stage is set for conflict, and the Alaskan summer season, where it's daylight all the time, adds to Pacino's fatigue and disorientation as he finds it impossible to sleep.  This is an icy wonderland, and the cinematography is excellent, capturing the unremitting sunshine as a spotlight of sorts on Pacino's past guilty conscience.  He's true to character throughout though, bending the rules for his own purposes.  And when he commits an act that might cast him in an unfavorable light, he again makes concessions to his conscience.  It's a great role and he's a fine actor.Robin Williams is cast as bad guy, an unusual part for him.

709299,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,B00006AGHD,Martin Asiner,"[0, 0]","Very few films have the courage to face only one aspect of the human condition and to build a plot based on that.  Director Chris Nolan takes the Norwegian book of the same name and transforms it into a metaphorical casting of light that illuminates the inevitable results of what happens when integrity is cast aside for expediency.  Al Pacino plays L. A. detective Will Dormer, who is called to aid in a murder investigation of a young high school girl in Alaska.  During the course of the film, the viewer learns that Dormer in under investigation by the L. A. internal affairs unit for having planted evidence to convict a sex criminal.  Dormer is the sort of scum-hating cop who feels that the ends sometimes justifies the means in keeping creeps off the streets.  Unlike other cop movies with a similar theme, Pacino invests his Dormer character with the sort of world-weary crisis of conscience that he had shown before as the aging Michael Corleone in GODFATHER III. Director Nolan uses the magnificent colors and sights of a land that knows no night to represent the brightness of a moral compass that Dormer sought, even back in L. A., to put him back on track.  It is no surprise then that from the moment that he arrives in Alaska, he suffers from the insomnia of the title. As he tries to solve the murder of a young girl, he is reminded of his own failings on two levels.  First by the light of the landscape that by contrast points out his earlier moral shortcomings, then later by the appearance of the real killer, Will Finch, played effectively by Robin Williams, who in his most recent films seems determined to eschew the comedy of his youth in favor of dark roles just like this one. Dormer and Finch are moral dopplegangers, not so much as two sides of a criminal coin, but as a coin with only one side.  More than once, Finch points out that if an accidental killing results in a benefit to society, then the architect of that killing ought to be lauded, not punished, for it.  Pacino hears this argument and is strongly leaning to accepting it.  But like Raskolnikov in CRIME AND PUNISHMENT, Dormer is prodded by his conscience in the form of Hillary Swank, who plays a policewoman who is bright enough to learn that the hero cop of her youth may also be a cop who now finds himself on the same moral plane as any other killer who seeks to justify killing solely on the basis of expediency.  What emerges from INSOMNIA is a call that is as bright and clear as the shiny landscapes of Alaska.  Truth is a beacon of light whose only purpose is to dispel the darkness of the immorality of sin.  And when each of us is faced with the choice of living in light or darkness, then Dormer warns us to make the right choice, or we may lose our way.",4,INSOMNIA: TRUTH AS LIGHT/LIES AS DARKNESS,1036195200,"11 2, 2002",2002,2763,"['Very', 'few', 'films', 'have', 'courage', 'face', 'only', 'one', 'aspect', 'human', 'condition', 'build', 'plot', 'based', 'Director', 'Chris', 'Nolan', 'Norwegian', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'transforms', 'metaphorical', 'casting', 'light', 'inevitable', 'results', 'what', 'when', 'integrity', 'cast', 'aside', 'expediency', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'L.', 'A.', 'detective', 'Will', 'Dormer', 'who', 'called', 'aid', 'murder', 'investigation', 'young', 'high', 'school', 'girl', 'Alaska', 'course', 'film', 'viewer', 'Dormer', 'investigation', 'L.', 'A.', 'internal', 'affairs', 'unit', 'having', 'planted', 'evidence', 'convict', 'sex', 'criminal', 'Dormer', 'sort', 'scum-hating', 'cop', 'who', 'ends', 'sometimes', 'means', 'keeping', 'creeps', 'streets', 'other', 'cop', 'movies', 'similar', 'theme', 'Pacino', 'Dormer', 'character', 'sort', 'world-weary', 'crisis', 'conscience', 'had', 'shown', 'before', 'aging', 'Michael', 'Corleone', 'GODFATHER', 'III', 'Director', 'Nolan', 'magnificent', 'colors', 'sights', 'land', 'night', 'represent', 'brightness', 'moral', 'compass', 'Dormer', 'sought', 'even', 'back', 'L.', 'A.', 'put', 'back', 'track', 'surprise', 'then', 'moment', 'Alaska', 'insomnia', 'title', 'solve', 'murder', 'young', 'girl', 'reminded', 'own', 'failings', 'two', 'levels', 'First', 'light', 'landscape', 'contrast', 'points', 'out', 'earlier', 'moral', 'shortcomings', 'then', 'later', 'appearance', 'real', 'killer', 'Will', 'Finch', 'played', 'effectively', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'who', 'most', 'recent', 'films', 'determined', 'eschew', 'comedy', 'youth', 'favor', 'dark', 'roles', 'just', 'one', 'Dormer', 'Finch', 'are', 'moral', 'dopplegangers', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'two', 'sides', 'criminal', 'coin', 'coin', 'only', 'one', 'side', 'More', 'once', 'Finch', 'out', 'accidental', 'killing', 'results', 'benefit', 'society', 'then', 'architect', 'killing', 'ought', 'be', 'lauded', 'not', 'punished', 'Pacino', 'argument', 'strongly', 'leaning', 'accepting', 'Raskolnikov', 'CRIME', 'AND', 'PUNISHMENT', 'Dormer', 'prodded', 'conscience', 'form', 'Hillary', 'Swank', 'who', 'policewoman', 'who', 'bright', 'enough', 'learn', 'hero', 'cop', 'youth', 'may', 'also', 'be', 'cop', 'who', 'now', 'same', 'moral', 'plane', 'other', 'killer', 'who', 'justify', 'killing', 'solely', 'basis', 'expediency', 'What', 'INSOMNIA', 'call', 'bright', 'clear', 'shiny', 'landscapes', 'Alaska', 'Truth', 'beacon', 'light', 'only', 'purpose', 'dispel', 'darkness', 'immorality', 'sin', 'when', 'faced', 'choice', 'living', 'light', 'darkness', 'then', 'Dormer', 'make', 'right', 'choice', 'may', 'lose', 'way']",Insomnia Region 2

Al Pacino is the big city cop from Los Angeles brought up to catch him.The town, Night Mute, is the Halibut Fishing Capital of the world, but with its picturesque granite mountains in the backdrop, it looks as though the movie was shot in a larger version of Yosemite National Park, one of the most beautifully breathtaking places in the entire world.Pacino solves the mystery early but kills his partner by accident in the process - and the killer sees him do it.  What ensues is a subtle mating dance where two spiders, Williams and Pacino, face off against each other.  One is going to die (probably) and the other is going to get screwed (just figuratively).The pretty girl who is killed is shown in flashback, and there isn't any skin in the entire flick, except if one counts her nude figure lying dead across the coroner's table.Hilary Swank plays a great role as a bushy tailed rookie cop who idolizes Pacino, but then at the end sees him as the human being that is all of us.The mental sparing between Williams and Pacino makes the film come alive - even though with the Alaskan 24-hour days Pacino isn't able to sleep throughout the entire film.The movie builds to a climactic finish, and you won't be able to either (sleep, that is!).

In large part, it succeeds in improving upon the original because it fleshes out the relationship between the main character and the killer he is pursuing.Detective Will Dormer [Al Pacino] and his partner are dispatched to the far reaches of Alaska to help investigate the grisly murder of a young woman. Internal Affairs has them under investigation back in Los Angeles, and their trip seems to be part of a plan to get them out of the way for awhile. With the help of local detective Ellie Burr [Hilary Swank], the investigation starts out well, but soon Dormer is plagued by insomnia triggered by the lack of darkness during the Alaskan summer. After a couple of days, fatigue sets in, and he begins to falter. The situation gets much worse after a dreadful accident occurs during a stakeout. It isn't long before the killer [Robin Williams] begins to play a deadly cat and mouse game with him. [Note: Saying who plays the killer gives almost nothing of the plot away.]The cast is uniformly excellent. Director Christopher Nolan, whose last film was the highly original thriller ""Memento"", again takes on the tricky concept of time. In this case, Dormer's insomnia causes him to lose track of time in a palce where there is no night. In the process, he also loses track of himself.""Insomnia""s main theme is moral ambiguity, and Dormer's not knowing whether it's day or night serves to underscores that theme.

709311,AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ,B00006AGHD,"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner""","[2, 2]","Anybody remember Memento? The independent film that critics and movie lovers in general loved so much but never got the public attention or the award recognition that it probably deserved? This wasn't so much a big deal for Newmarket, the studio that distributed the film, since the film went on to make nearly three times its budget but this has to be somewhat upsetting for the filmmakers who wanted more from their work but life goes on. The director of Memento, who is currently in the works with the new Batman project, went on to a new film called Insomnia, based on a Norwegian film of the same name. What makes this film interesting is the casting of certain roles within the film. No, its not just Al Pacino, though he does add some flavor of dramatic talent to the film, it's the casting of Robin Williams as the killer. Williams, who is best known for his comedic performances in Popeye, Aladdin and Hook, isn't the first choice that comes to mind in this area but if it works, the film could spawn a cult status on the same level as Memento.The story centers on the investigation of a murder in Alaska and the cat and mouse game that the killer instigates with one of the detectives. When a teenage girl is found murdered in a small town in Alaska, a veteran police detective and his partner are sent up to over-see an official investigation. Just as the two close in on the primary suspect of the murder, the veteran detective accidentally kills his partner in a chase, believing he was the murderer. The detective then lies about the accidental homicide and gets away with it. But he soon finds out that he isn't the only living soul who saw it happen. The murderer calls up the detective, who is racked with guilt, and plans to blackmail him into letting him go free. Now the veteran police detective must choose what means more to him, his life or his commitment to justice. The story for Insomnia does a wonderful job at dealing with conflicts of the human psyche when it comes to guilt but wasn't as surprising as Memento was. But this is a small issue as it is hard to follow up to such a critical success was that film was with many critics.Though the cast of Insomnia represents a wide range of actors and actresses from different performance backgrounds, it doesn't change the fact that they work perfectly together. Al Pacino in the role of the veteran detective brings the film a sense of seniority, which is a good thing in this case, and plays the character perfectly all the way to the end. He showcases a man truly racked with guilt in such a way that it allows his character to really connect with audience members without giving the end to the feature away. Even though it may seem a weird choice for the role of the killer, Robin Williams gives an impressive performance in this film. The veteran comedian seems to be really be adding up his dramatic performances with roles in other adult-oriented features like One Hour Photo and Death to Smoochy and adds to his impressive resume that includes an Oscar winning performance in Good Will Hunting. Hilary Swank, as good as she could have been in this film, isn't given much, in the area of material, that allows her to really expand her acting ability.Overall, despite lack the suspense and the surprising twists of its predecessor, Memento, Christopher Nolan gives an impressive follow-up with Insomnia that stands above most cop thrillers. The problems lie in the feature's time-length, which felt longer then it should have been, and its pacing, which seemed dragged down in certain areas. The lack of usable material for smaller characters with the film, like Hilary Swank, was a shame in there was a lot of potential for several enjoyable performances but nothing developed. Other then that, Insomnia gives an engaging view into the human psyche and the effects of guilt on the subconscious combined with amazing dramatic performances from Al Pacino and Robin Williams.",4,The Moose Hole - Can't Sleep?

709312,A27PSZX2SE0B51,B00006AGHD,Mike Stone,"[1, 2]","There's a sequence about half way through ""Insomnia"", where rumpled L.A. cop Will Dormer chases a man he believes to be the murderer he's come to Alaska to find, across a log drive.  It's a thrilling moment, especially when Dormer trips into the water and finds himself trapped beneath the logs.  By about halfway through the scene, I realized a startling thing: I was watching 62-year old Al Pacino and 50-year old Robin Williams acting out a footrace.  And it was enthralling.  In hindsight, I suppose I shouldn't have been surprised, for ""Insomnia"" lives to confound its audience's expectations.That's a strange statement to make considering it's a remake.  But when the original happens to be a 5-year old Norwegian film, one that I've beaten my brains out trying to find in local video stores for years, it makes much more sense.  And when you realize that Christopher Nolan, the auteur-mastermind behind 2000's ""Memento"", you come to expect the unexpected.Nolan tackles a much more conventional thriller this time out.  ""Conventional"" being a relative terms, for ""Insomnia"" is anything but.  Sure, all the typical elements are there, but it's less focused on bringing those elements together, or on working through the machinations of the plot.  Rather, it spends its time thoroughly dissecting the psychologies of its characters.In the end, ""Insomnia"" is really about one thing: the slow disintegration of one good cop.  Will Dormer (= dormir = to sleep; yeah, yeah, we get it) is Serpico 20 years down the line: a legend in his own mind and the mind of others.  But his reputation has been severely damaged even before he gets to Nightmute, the small Alaskan town known as the ""Halibut fishing capital of the world"".  And the events of his first day in Alaska quicken the spin of his downward spiral.  This all serves to set up the most destructive force in his life: his insomnia (a motif that would have been terribly important even if they hadn't named the film after it).Pacino and Nolan, in tandem, do a wonderful job of relaying the experience of insomnia to the audience.  Nolan uses self-consciously tricky camera work, exhibiting hallucinations and lack of focus.  Pacino uses an intense dreariness -- look at his eyes, even more hangdog than usual -- a slurring of speech, and a hunched over gait.  The startling thing is that neither allows Dormer to make excuses for his debilitating condition.  In fact, they allow Dormer to, in moments, flash some of his brilliance for the audience and, more importantly, his new Alaskan cop colleagues, to see.  The tragedy is that he just can't maintain it.Pacino, who I find overbearing in his louder work, mines the same gold that yielded him Michael Corleone and the aging mobster in ""Donnie Brasco"".  He's quiet, introspective, but not averse to lashing out when the time is right.  It's an astounding performance that reminds you yet again why Pacino can be, when reined in, one of the most powerful and subtle actors ever captured on film.Robin Williams' hyper-kinetic screen persona has worn thin in recent years.  But like Pacino, when he controls his energy he is astounding.  His work here is a prime example of that.  He plays Walter Finch, a wannabe-cop turned pulp crime novelist-cum-pocket philosopher, who is only a worthy adversary because Dormer is so out of it.  In any other circumstance, he'd be Dormer's breakfast, digested before lunch.  Williams is mostly controlled and cool throughout.  But he also allows all of Finch's insecurities to shine through.  He's not a perfect super-villain, just a man caught in an extreme situation, frantically using the tools he has to get out of it.  It is easily Williams' best work, trumping even his Oscar-winning turn in ""Good Will Hunting"".Hillary Swank, the cast's third Oscar-winner, starts out slow as Ellie Burr, a local cop.  Her work felt manner and awkward, until you realize later on that she was supposed to be mannered and awkward.  She is putting on a good show for Dormer, a cop she idolizes.  Later on, however, Ellie becomes integral to the suspense: the audience, who know what's going on, become tense waiting for to get up to speed, unsure if she ever will and even if they want her to.Besides his work with Pacino's psychology, Nolan ably uses all the elements on his director's palette to heighten and expand the suspense.  Quick, subliminal cuts jarringly remind us of important points in the action.  Extreme close-ups allude to secrets yet to be revealed.  And haunting imagery (the plane ride that opens the film, over an endless sea of jagged ice, comes to mind) set a solid tone.  His most accomplished sequence is shot through a dense fog.  Dormer is sure that there's a killer out there somewhere, brandishing a weapon, but he can't see him.  It's a terrific suspenseful moment.  All this dispels the notion that Nolan was a one-hit wonder with ""Memento"".  Clearly he's a talent we can expect a lot more from.Some have claimed that ""Insomnia"" ends in a typical suspense movie fashion.  I couldn't disagree more.  I enjoyed these frantic scenes thoroughly, for they not only tidied up the plot, but were tempered by some bleak dark humour, a rhetorical device that periodically pops up, when needed, throughout the film.  So from top to bottom ""Insomnia"" is a solid piece of filmmaking, entertaining throughout, and psychologically thought provoking.

The moral debate, the intrigue and tension are elements that help to invigorate the plot. The somber tone of the characters is reflected masterfully with the portrayals of Williams and Pacino.Insomnia lets us see that not everything in life is black and white. Our experiences, generally, are a mix of grays. It also explores the reasons and motives of villains, and the vulnerabilities of heroes.At some point, inspector Dormer defines his position when affirms that ""his job is to assign guilt"".

This movie revolves around Will Dormer (Al Pacino at his dreary best) who has come to Alaska with his partner to investigate a rather brutal murder.  A girl was beaten senseless but than the killer carefully cleaned up the corpse to hide his deed.  But just as Will is on to him, he accidently (or was it an accident) shoots his partner while chasing the killer in the fog.  Then, the killer and Will begin a game of wits, a taunt cat and mouse game that pits each others souls, and lives, on the line.  Will past comes into play, and the killers real intentions.The film is made ever the more suspenseful by the razor sharp directing of Christopher Nolan, the mind behind last years ""Memento.""  He gives the film a sense of wild motion, to simulate the emotions and the slowly slipping mind of Dormer, who cannot get an ounce of sleep becasue of the 24 hour sunlight of Alaskas summer.  He also gets the best out of his actors, who all are in their best mode for movie making.  We don't only know the characters from the expertly written script, but also from the actors expressions, gestures and vocal inflections.  In other words, you don't need the well-written script to get the characters emotions and personality.Al Pacino is the best part of this movie.  His perfect portrayal of the conflicted Dormer goes down as one of the best performances he has turned in.  Though he will proably be forgotten, he should at least be considered by the Academy for his work in this film.  ot to mention director Christopher Nolan and the sinister Robin Williams, who  turns in a truly creepy performance in his role as a small town writer.",5,The Oscars Should Keep This One in Mind,1041465600,"01 2, 2003",2003,1750,"['couple', 'Hollywood', 'legends', 'are', 'top', 'form', 'newcomer', 'director', 'first', 'mind-bender', 'was', ""n't"", 'fluke', 'movie', 'around', 'Will', 'Dormer', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'dreary', 'best', 'who', 'come', 'Alaska', 'partner', 'investigate', 'rather', 'brutal', 'murder', 'girl', 'was', 'beaten', 'senseless', 'killer', 'carefully', 'cleaned', 'up', 'corpse', 'hide', 'deed', 'just', 'as', 'Will', 'accidently', 'was', 'accident', 'shoots', 'partner', 'chasing', 'killer', 'fog', 'Then', 'killer', 'Will', 'begin', 'game', 'wits', 'taunt', 'cat', 'mouse', 'game', 'others', 'souls', 'lives', 'line', 'Will', 'play', 'killers', 'real', 'intentions.The', 'film', 'made', 'ever', 'more', 'suspenseful', 'razor', 'sharp', 'directing', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'mind', 'last', 'years', 'Memento', 'film', 'sense', 'wild', 'motion', 'simulate', 'emotions', 'slowly', 'slipping', 'mind', 'Dormer', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'ounce', 'sleep', 'becasue', '24', 'hour', 'sunlight', 'Alaskas', 'summer', 'also', 'best', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'best', 'mode', 'movie', 'making', 'do', ""n't"", 'only', 'know', 'characters', 'expertly', 'written', 'script', 'also', 'actors', 'expressions', 'gestures', 'vocal', 'inflections', 'other', 'words', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'well-written', 'script', 'get', 'characters', 'emotions', 'personality.Al', 'Pacino', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'perfect', 'portrayal', 'conflicted', 'Dormer', 'down', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'turned', 'will', 'proably', 'be', 'forgotten', 'should', 'least', 'be', 'considered', 'Academy', 'work', 'film', 'ot', 'mention', 'director', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'sinister', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'who', 'truly', 'creepy', 'performance', 'role', 'small', 'town', 'writer']",Insomnia Region 2

709318,A1YHKSTVSYEYTU,B00006AGHD,Mr. N. Carnegie,"[0, 0]","Insomnia is of course a remake of a Norwegian film starring Stellan Skarsgard, directed by Erik Skjoldbjaerg in 1997 but as much as this may make me a heathen to European film culture, I must confess to having never seen the original. However, thanks to one of my good friends (Steve, take a bow) I was lucky enough to see the UK premier of Insomnia as the closing movie of the 2002 Edinburgh film festival and lucky enough to see and hear the Director Christopher Nolan say a few words about this fine movie.Opening with incredibly stunning cinematography of Alaskan ice fields, haggard L.A police detective Will Dormer (Al Pacino) and his partner Hep Eckhart (Martin Donovan) arrive in America's most northerly city to help solve the brutal killing of a teenage girl. Met by a local Detective (Hilary Swank) who openly hero-worships Dormer and his successful career as a Detective, Pacino's character sets about showing the local hicks how it's done. However, it soon transpires that Dormer is only in Alaska in the first place to avoid an ongoing criminal investigation by police Internal Affairs back in Los Angeles and it is not long before his investigation into the Alaskan girl's murder goes horribly wrong. Troubled by his conscience and the never-ending daylight of an Alaskan summer Dormer prays for sleep.For many people that have seen either of Christopher Nolan's previous two movies (Following and Memento) Insomnia may seem like an odd choice; it's a 'mainstream' Hollywood movie (Warner Brothers studio), it is told in a linear timeframe and it's a remake. However, there must have been obvious attractions apart from the budget and his paycheck. First off, Stephen Soderbergh, who successfully makes mainstream movies with an Indie heart, oversaw production and secondly there was the chance to work with great actors such as Pacino, Swank and Robin Williams, although at this point I have to add that I believe Williams was totally miscast and made an unconvincing villain.There are some wonderful scenes in this movie, including a nightmare like chase over hundreds of floating logs and the hunt for the killer in a freezing fog. It is also a movie that allows it's stars to shine and this is undoubtedly Pacino's best role (and best movie for many a year) and it is a pleasant change to see him with a decent script in an intelligent movie instead of hamming it up in the likes of The Devil's Advocate, alongside walking surfboard Keanu Reeves. This movie will also undoubtedly and deservedly enhance the careers and reputations of both Director Christopher Nolan and Hilary Swank, who both produce work of depth and subtlety. However, I also feel that much of the credit for what is a beautiful photographed and well-written movie should go to Wally Pfister and (for what is an excellent adapted screenplay) to Hilary Seitz. Insomnia is an excellent movie made by a very modest, very talented young British movie Director. Be warned though, you probably need an IQ to fully appreciate it.",4,**** WORTH STAYING AWAKE FOR ****,1047254400,"03 10, 2003",2003,3010,"['Insomnia', 'course', 'remake', 'Norwegian', 'film', 'starring', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgard', 'directed', 'Erik', 'Skjoldbjaerg', '1997', 'as', 'much', 'may', 'make', 'heathen', 'European', 'film', 'culture', 'must', 'confess', 'having', 'never', 'seen', 'original', 'However', 'thanks', 'one', 'good', 'friends', 'Steve', 'take', 'bow', 'was', 'lucky', 'enough', 'see', 'UK', 'premier', 'Insomnia', 'closing', 'movie', '2002', 'Edinburgh', 'film', 'festival', 'lucky', 'enough', 'see', 'hear', 'Director', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'say', 'few', 'words', 'fine', 'movie.Opening', 'incredibly', 'stunning', 'cinematography', 'Alaskan', 'ice', 'fields', 'haggard', 'L.A', 'police', 'detective', 'Will', 'Dormer', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'partner', 'Hep', 'Eckhart', 'Martin', 'Donovan', 'arrive', 'America', 'most', 'northerly', 'city', 'help', 'solve', 'brutal', 'killing', 'teenage', 'girl', 'Met', 'local', 'Detective', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'who', 'openly', 'hero-worships', 'Dormer', 'successful', 'career', 'Detective', 'Pacino', 'character', 'sets', 'showing', 'local', 'how', 'done', 'However', 'soon', 'Dormer', 'only', 'Alaska', 'first', 'place', 'avoid', 'ongoing', 'criminal', 'investigation', 'police', 'Internal', 'Affairs', 'back', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'not', 'long', 'investigation', 'Alaskan', 'girl', 'murder', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'Troubled', 'conscience', 'never-ending', 'daylight', 'Alaskan', 'summer', 'Dormer', 'prays', 'sleep.For', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'seen', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'previous', 'two', 'movies', 'Following', 'Memento', 'Insomnia', 'may', 'seem', 'odd', 'choice', ""'mainstream"", 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'studio', 'told', 'linear', 'timeframe', 'remake', 'However', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'obvious', 'attractions', 'apart', 'budget', 'paycheck', 'First', 'off', 'Stephen', 'Soderbergh', 'who', 'successfully', 'mainstream', 'movies', 'Indie', 'heart', 'oversaw', 'production', 'secondly', 'was', 'chance', 'work', 'great', 'actors', 'such', 'Pacino', 'Swank', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'point', 'have', 'add', 'believe', 'Williams', 'was', 'totally', 'miscast', 'made', 'unconvincing', 'villain.There', 'are', 'wonderful', 'scenes', 'movie', 'including', 'nightmare', 'chase', 'hundreds', 'floating', 'logs', 'hunt', 'killer', 'freezing', 'fog', 'also', 'movie', 'stars', 'shine', 'undoubtedly', 'Pacino', 'best', 'role', 'best', 'movie', 'many', 'year', 'pleasant', 'change', 'see', 'decent', 'script', 'intelligent', 'movie', 'instead', 'hamming', 'up', 'likes', 'Devil', 'Advocate', 'alongside', 'walking', 'surfboard', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'movie', 'will', 'also', 'undoubtedly', 'deservedly', 'enhance', 'careers', 'reputations', 'Director', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'who', 'produce', 'work', 'depth', 'subtlety', 'However', 'also', 'feel', 'much', 'credit', 'what', 'beautiful', 'photographed', 'well-written', 'movie', 'should', 'go', 'Wally', 'Pfister', 'what', 'excellent', 'adapted', 'screenplay', 'Hilary', 'Seitz', 'Insomnia', 'excellent', 'movie', 'made', 'very', 'modest', 'very', 'talented', 'young', 'British', 'movie', 'Director', 'Be', 'warned', 'probably', 'need', 'IQ', 'fully', 'appreciate']",Insomnia Region 2
709319,A2PHQPZ36HE4MN,B00006AGHD,Mrs B,"[0, 2]","This  psychological thriller is based upon Norwegian writer Erik Skjoldbjaerg's novel of the same title.  Al Pacino took a 4 year absence from acting before this film, and it's no surprise that this one broke him from his hiatus, as it has a great script and it stars two other Academy Award winning performers, Hillary Swank and Robin Williams.Set in Alaska, this film is about Will Dormer, a veteran LA detective, played by Pacino. Dormer is sent with partner Hap Eckhart to investigate the grisly murder of a 17-year-old girl. At the same time, Dormer & Eckhart are being investigated by internal affairs for some suspicious police work, which Dormer believes Eckhart is about to spill the beans about.The two colleagues are welcomed in Alaska by Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank), a policewoman who is also interested in solving this strange case. Dormer accidentally shoots his partner Eckhart, but knows how it will look if he confesses to the shooting, so he misleads them to believe that the suspect did the shooting and continues the investigation.  The story goes through some interesting twists and turns from there on.Three academy award winners in one movie that is based on a fantastic book with the same director as Memento seems like a sure winner, and it certainly did well at the box office, but it falls flat.  Perhaps Swank and Pacino are afraid to upstage each other, as both their performances lack emotional depth and energy.  Williams' performance is shockingly superb, however, as this role is a side of him not yet seen and he plays it very well.  He finally shows he is a talented actor with more range than the Patch Adams and Mrs Doubtfire roles he usually takes.  Williams' great performance can't save this film though, as it just doesn't get to the heart.  The lack of emotional impact of it has is disappointing, as the criminal is more interesting and complex than the cops.  The line fine they are creating between cop and criminal isn't lost on me, but Pacino's character is wooden and emotionally superficial and there's a void in the film where a great character should be.This movie is proof that too many chefs spoil the cake, as too many great actors made what should have been a spectacular film into this mediocre film.",3,Falls Flat,1063843200,"09 18, 2003",2003,2254,"['psychological', 'thriller', 'based', 'Norwegian', 'writer', 'Erik', 'Skjoldbjaerg', 'novel', 'same', 'title', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'took', '4', 'year', 'absence', 'acting', 'film', 'surprise', 'one', 'broke', 'hiatus', 'great', 'script', 'two', 'other', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winning', 'performers', 'Hillary', 'Swank', 'Robin', 'Williams.Set', 'Alaska', 'film', 'about', 'Will', 'Dormer', 'veteran', 'LA', 'detective', 'played', 'Pacino', 'Dormer', 'sent', 'partner', 'Hap', 'Eckhart', 'investigate', 'grisly', 'murder', '17-year-old', 'girl', 'same', 'time', 'Dormer', 'Eckhart', 'are', 'being', 'investigated', 'internal', 'affairs', 'suspicious', 'police', 'work', 'Dormer', 'Eckhart', 'spill', 'beans', 'about.The', 'two', 'colleagues', 'are', 'welcomed', 'Alaska', 'Ellie', 'Burr', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'policewoman', 'who', 'also', 'interested', 'solving', 'strange', 'case', 'Dormer', 'accidentally', 'shoots', 'partner', 'Eckhart', 'how', 'will', 'look', 'shooting', 'believe', 'suspect', 'did', 'shooting', 'investigation', 'story', 'interesting', 'twists', 'turns', 'on.Three', 'academy', 'award', 'winners', 'one', 'movie', 'based', 'fantastic', 'book', 'same', 'director', 'Memento', 'sure', 'winner', 'certainly', 'did', 'well', 'box', 'office', 'flat', 'Perhaps', 'Swank', 'Pacino', 'are', 'afraid', 'upstage', 'other', 'performances', 'lack', 'emotional', 'depth', 'energy', 'Williams', 'performance', 'shockingly', 'superb', 'however', 'role', 'side', 'not', 'yet', 'seen', 'very', 'well', 'finally', 'talented', 'actor', 'more', 'range', 'Patch', 'Adams', 'Mrs', 'Doubtfire', 'usually', 'Williams', 'great', 'performance', 'ca', ""n't"", 'save', 'film', 'though', 'just', ""n't"", 'get', 'heart', 'lack', 'emotional', 'impact', 'disappointing', 'criminal', 'more', 'interesting', 'complex', 'cops', 'line', 'fine', 'are', 'creating', 'cop', 'criminal', ""n't"", 'lost', 'Pacino', 'character', 'wooden', 'emotionally', 'superficial', 'void', 'film', 'where', 'great', 'character', 'should', 'be.This', 'movie', 'proof', 'too', 'many', 'chefs', 'spoil', 'cake', 'too', 'many', 'great', 'actors', 'made', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'spectacular', 'film', 'mediocre', 'film']",Insomnia Region 2

Al Pacino plays an L.A. detective called into a case in Alaska involving a dead teenage girl.  When Pacino arrives he finds a web of secrets, all leading to Robin Williams (cast surprisingly perfect as the killer), who learns that Pacino himself has some secrets.  Hillary Swank is great as well in her role as a rookie cop, proving her Oscar win wasn't a fluke.  The atmosphere of the film, especially between Pacino and Williams (the scene where they meet face to face) is what makes Insomnia a winner, and Nolan doesn't compromise his directorial skills and keeps Insomnia an unorthodox game of cat & mouse.  The cinematography is worth noting as well, and should be remembered when Oscar time rolls around.

We have also seen him in a memorable few dramatic roles such as ""Dead Poets Society"", ""Good Will Hunting"", ""What Dreams May Come"", and ""Jakob the Liar"". But now, Williams really outdoes himself when he takes on the role of...ruthless killer! The movie is called ""Insomnia"", a film with so much intensity and suspense that you would have to see it again and again! The direction of Christopher Nolan (""Memento"") is brilliant in every way possible! Williams is also paired up with fellow Academy Award winners Hilary Swank (Best Actress, 1999: ""Boys Don't Cry"") and the legendary Al Pacino (Best Actor, 1992: ""Scent of a Woman"") into bringing this thriller of Hitchcockian proportions to the big screen! ""Insomnia"" focuses on a seasoned veteran LAPD detective named Will Dormer (Pacino), who is invited to Nightmute, Alaska with his partner, Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan), to head a murder case. Dormer teams up with an inexperienced, young detective named Ellie Burr (Swank) in order to find out who caused the murder and why. But during the case, Dormer finds himself and his investigation disrupted by an ever-shining midnight sun that wreaks sleep-depriving havoc on him. In other words, Dormer has inside of him what we call a ""body clock"". It could go off at any moment, on any day, and at any time as well. The case has also disrupted Dormer by personal guilt over a second crime that may be real...or a figment of his increasingly unstable conciousness. During the movie, the prime suspect in the murder case is a best-selling author named Walter Finch (Williams). And to me, it seems as though Dormer may have met his match when Finch starts playing these sadistic mind games with Dormer which will eventually lead to a shocking finale between the two foes! I have the DVD version of ""Insomnia"", loaded with extras such as an additional scene, scene-specific commentaries with Hilary Swank and crew, featurettes, theatrical trailer, stills gallery, and DVD-ROM features. In conclusion, I just have to say that ""Insomnia"" is truly one of the sharpest thrillers that I've seen since Nolan's ""Memento"" or any other thriller. With three of the greatest acting talents today, a fine supporting cast (Maura Tierney, Nicky Katt, Paul Dooley), and an incredible storyline that will keep you guessing until the very end, ""Insomnia"" is a must-see for everyone and a DVD must-own if you are an avid Robin Williams fan or an avid Al Pacino fan!",5,"""Insomnia""...The darker side of Robin Williams!!",1035244800,"10 22, 2002",2002,2660,"['have', 'seen', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winner', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', '1997', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'lots', 'hilarious', 'films', 'such', 'Mrs.', 'Doubtfire', 'Good', 'Morning', 'Vietnam', 'Bicentennial', 'Man', 'Death', 'Smoochy', 'have', 'also', 'seen', 'memorable', 'few', 'dramatic', 'roles', 'such', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'Society', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'What', 'Dreams', 'May', 'Come', 'Jakob', 'Liar', 'now', 'Williams', 'really', 'when', 'role', 'ruthless', 'killer', 'movie', 'called', 'Insomnia', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'intensity', 'suspense', 'would', 'have', 'see', 'again', 'again', 'direction', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'Memento', 'brilliant', 'way', 'possible', 'Williams', 'also', 'paired', 'up', 'fellow', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winners', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'Best', 'Actress', '1999', 'Boys', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', 'legendary', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Best', 'Actor', '1992', 'Scent', 'Woman', 'bringing', 'thriller', 'Hitchcockian', 'proportions', 'big', 'screen', 'Insomnia', 'seasoned', 'veteran', 'LAPD', 'detective', 'named', 'Will', 'Dormer', 'Pacino', 'who', 'invited', 'Nightmute', 'Alaska', 'partner', 'Hap', 'Eckhart', 'Martin', 'Donovan', 'head', 'murder', 'case', 'Dormer', 'up', 'inexperienced', 'young', 'detective', 'named', 'Ellie', 'Burr', 'Swank', 'order', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'caused', 'murder', 'why', 'case', 'Dormer', 'investigation', 'disrupted', 'ever-shining', 'midnight', 'sun', 'sleep-depriving', 'havoc', 'other', 'words', 'Dormer', 'inside', 'what', 'call', 'body', 'clock', 'could', 'go', 'off', 'moment', 'day', 'time', 'as', 'well', 'case', 'also', 'disrupted', 'Dormer', 'personal', 'guilt', 'second', 'crime', 'may', 'be', 'real', 'figment', 'increasingly', 'unstable', 'conciousness', 'movie', 'prime', 'suspect', 'murder', 'case', 'best-selling', 'author', 'named', 'Walter', 'Finch', 'Williams', 'Dormer', 'may', 'have', 'met', 'match', 'when', 'Finch', 'playing', 'sadistic', 'mind', 'games', 'Dormer', 'will', 'eventually', 'lead', 'shocking', 'finale', 'two', 'foes', 'have', 'DVD', 'version', 'Insomnia', 'loaded', 'extras', 'such', 'additional', 'scene', 'scene-specific', 'commentaries', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'crew', 'featurettes', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'gallery', 'DVD-ROM', 'features', 'conclusion', 'just', 'have', 'say', 'Insomnia', 'truly', 'one', 'sharpest', 'thrillers', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Nolan', 'Memento', 'other', 'thriller', 'three', 'greatest', 'acting', 'talents', 'today', 'fine', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Maura', 'Tierney', 'Nicky', 'Katt', 'Paul', 'Dooley', 'incredible', 'storyline', 'will', 'keep', 'guessing', 'very', 'end', 'Insomnia', 'must-see', 'everyone', 'DVD', 'must-own', 'are', 'avid', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'fan', 'avid', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'fan']",Insomnia Region 2

709323,A1U4VN19O89I3U,B00006AGHD,"Nick S ""Film, Book and Music Freak""","[0, 0]","Insomnia is oftentimes engaging, sharply photographed, and nicely acted despite its genre conventions. It reminds one of the old film-noir movies, and even has a trace of Hitchcock in the subtle way most of the movie proceeds with its psychological-thriller concepts (the sense of quiet creepiness reminds one of Shadow of a Doubt.) Although the simplistic plot concerning a web of lies and murder wrecking psychological sleep deprivation on a homicide detective that is working to find a killer in a Alaskan town may not do much to advance this genre, the film is quite watchable. It is captivating formulism.In part this is due to the film's leads (Al Pacino and Hilary Swank) that are played impeccably, and the real surprise of the main cast is Robin Williams. Giving a very understated and nuanced performance as the killer, Williams reminds one of the low-key villains that have a sense of soft-spoken eeriness to them and crooked logic that makes their manner oftentimes just as scary as a raving lunatic due to them feeling like your average, kind next door neighbors. The acting also complements the mood of the film, as well.Directed by Christopher Nolan, the film is shot much different than the dark shadows of those noir pictures. This film invokes its location of the 24-hour sunlight of Alaska with a lot of grays, blues, and well, sunlight. Nolan tells the story with both an atmospheric visual flair, and also shows considerable grasp at tension, even if the audience can guess what will happen. As Nolan may keep things rote, screenwriter Hillary Seitz and he also keep the elements rather grounded with both a sense of drama, apt monologues, and astute dialogue. There is even a quite nail-biting scene that has Pacino pursuing Williams on water logs, only for things to turn rather wet.If Insomnia falters it is because the plot is only intricate in terms of the central dilemma, and not in terms of its development. Thematically, the elements are rather obvious in the morals that the film examines and at times it is also very Hollywood in regards to its stance on these beliefs. The film is almost too bittersweet in its logic, and since it ends on a moral note this also seems so obvious and predetermined that it comes without surprise or a sense of subversion; this is especially true in the climax.In the end, Insomnia does nothing to reinvent the wheel, or even add anything to it. Rather, it just spins it well enough that it is both sincere and skilled enough about what it sets out to do.

709324,A10X0JN8KTK89H,B00006AGHD,ninjasuperstar,"[5, 6]","Sleep disorders are not new to murder mysteries, but the way Christopher Nolan represents insomnia visually is at least as wonderful as Al Pacino's patient acting.  Pacino plays a detective from L.A., Will Dormer, who is sent to Alaska to help out an old friend with a murder case.  Dormer and his partner (played by Martin Donovan) are under investigation by Internal Affairs in L.A., so there's more to this temporary transfer than assisting a fellow badge.In Alaska, it's light all day and every day when Dormer and his partner arrive, and Dormer has insomnia.  Pacino gradually slows his character's actions and reactions down until I felt that he was severely debilitated and in danger.  He makes mistakes: some deliberate, others on accident, and still others he isn't sure of.  The latter make for the most intriguing part of this well-constructed thriller.Hillary Swank plays the smart, plucky detective, Ellie Burr, who is stuck serving misdemeanors instead of actual collars.  She has studied Dormer's career and admires him.  Swank plays the role without overreaching.  I cannot say the same for Pacino.  Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, and Jack Nicholson all suffer from the same affliction: As great as they are as actors, their personalities are greater.  I cannot watch them in films and pretend that they are anyone but themselves.  I still enjoy their performances, but they are decidedly bigger than any of the characters they have ever played.  They just can't help it.Maura Tierney gives an excellent but thankless performance as the front desk clerk (or manager) of the hotel where Dormer and his partner stay.  She softens Pacino in a way that Swank is unable to do.  Or maybe Pacino tempers himself; it's hard to tell.Robin Williams, as Walter Finch, is quite excellent at being creepy.  The banter between Finch and Dormer is something of a throwback to a different time: ""You're my job,"" says Dormer when Finch maneuvers for sympathy.  They seem to know each other as if from across the room, not like lovers, but like familiar character types in a familiar story.And Nolan isn't trying to do anything entirely new in Insomnia.  He's telling you a story you already know.  He twists it slightly with great visual effects and a cold, blue camera lens.  As much as I enjoy the film, it's not perfect.  The screenplay is written into a corner, and the ending is easy to see a mile away.  Likewise, some of the dialogue between Dormer and Finch is heavy-handed and cheesy.At its heart, this is the story of a downfall.  Don't judge the film by its murder/mystery/suspense genre tag.  Character takes precedence over plot.  It's not as good as Nolan's Memento, but Nolan's craft leaves its marks.",4,A Drama in Thriller's Clothing,1170374400,"02 2, 2007",2007,2711,"['Sleep', 'disorders', 'are', 'not', 'new', 'murder', 'mysteries', 'way', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'insomnia', 'visually', 'least', 'as', 'wonderful', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'patient', 'acting', 'Pacino', 'detective', 'L.A.', 'Will', 'Dormer', 'who', 'sent', 'Alaska', 'help', 'out', 'old', 'friend', 'murder', 'case', 'Dormer', 'partner', 'played', 'Martin', 'Donovan', 'are', 'investigation', 'Internal', 'Affairs', 'L.A.', 'more', 'temporary', 'transfer', 'assisting', 'fellow', 'badge.In', 'Alaska', 'light', 'day', 'day', 'when', 'Dormer', 'partner', 'arrive', 'Dormer', 'insomnia', 'Pacino', 'gradually', 'character', 'actions', 'reactions', 'down', 'felt', 'was', 'severely', 'debilitated', 'danger', 'mistakes', 'deliberate', 'others', 'accident', 'still', 'others', ""n't"", 'sure', 'latter', 'make', 'most', 'intriguing', 'part', 'well-constructed', 'thriller.Hillary', 'Swank', 'smart', 'plucky', 'detective', 'Ellie', 'Burr', 'who', 'stuck', 'serving', 'misdemeanors', 'instead', 'actual', 'collars', 'studied', 'Dormer', 'career', 'Swank', 'role', 'overreaching', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'same', 'Pacino', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'suffer', 'same', 'affliction', 'As', 'great', 'are', 'actors', 'personalities', 'are', 'greater', 'can', 'not', 'watch', 'films', 'pretend', 'are', 'anyone', 'still', 'enjoy', 'performances', 'are', 'decidedly', 'bigger', 'characters', 'have', 'ever', 'played', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'it.Maura', 'Tierney', 'excellent', 'thankless', 'performance', 'front', 'desk', 'clerk', 'manager', 'hotel', 'where', 'Dormer', 'partner', 'stay', 'Pacino', 'way', 'Swank', 'unable', 'do', 'maybe', 'Pacino', 'tempers', 'hard', 'tell.Robin', 'Williams', 'Walter', 'Finch', 'quite', 'excellent', 'being', 'creepy', 'banter', 'Finch', 'Dormer', 'something', 'throwback', 'different', 'time', ""'re"", 'job', 'Dormer', 'when', 'Finch', 'maneuvers', 'sympathy', 'seem', 'know', 'other', 'room', 'not', 'lovers', 'familiar', 'character', 'types', 'familiar', 'story.And', 'Nolan', ""n't"", 'trying', 'do', 'anything', 'entirely', 'new', 'Insomnia', 'telling', 'story', 'already', 'know', 'slightly', 'great', 'visual', 'effects', 'cold', 'blue', 'camera', 'As', 'much', 'enjoy', 'film', 'not', 'perfect', 'screenplay', 'written', 'corner', 'ending', 'easy', 'see', 'mile', 'away', 'Likewise', 'dialogue', 'Dormer', 'Finch', 'heavy-handed', 'cheesy.At', 'heart', 'story', 'downfall', 'Do', ""n't"", 'judge', 'film', 'murder/mystery/suspense', 'genre', 'tag', 'Character', 'precedence', 'plot', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Nolan', 'Memento', 'Nolan', 'craft', 'marks']",Insomnia Region 2

The small town Nightmute, Alaska, has just lost one of it's young citizens to a violent killer and the locals could use some help catching the guy.  But that's not all as Pacino's character is quite possibly dodging an internal affairs investigation back home, one that is complicated when his partner states his intention to testify to protect his family.  During a subsequent chase through the Alaskain wilderness, Pacino accidentally shoots and kills his partner and, knowing that the circumstances will cause everyone to doubt him, blames it on the killer.  Hillary Swank plays a local cop assigned to the case to make sure everything is in order when the killer's caught and brought to trial and Robin Williams plays the killer, who saw everything that happened out in the woods.  Williams proceeds to taunt Pacino with this information, seeking to beat a murder charge.  This is a thrilling film with a top-notch catch.  Despite his short stint on the screen, Donovan has great chemistry with Pacino.  The two aren't life partners or anything, but when it comes to their jobs, they feel they can count on each other...at least before they got to Alaska.  It's cool to see Robin Williams playing an antagonist once in a while and he certainly makes the most of his role.  Hillary Swank fits in perfectly as the rookie cop in a small, middle-of-nowhere town who idolizes Pacino (who wouldn't) and only seeks to do right by him.

And I have to say that Robin Williams did not disappoint me in the fact that he played a character so unlike the humorous characters he's play in years past.  He did a fantastic job!!!Though it's nice to see movies on the big screen, in my opinion I'd save your money and wait until it comes out on video and DVD to rent it.  If nothing else, the cinematography, views of Alaska and Robin Williams' performance was worth it.But again, this is just my opinion.  There seems to be other's on here who differ, which is why this country is so great as we are all entitled to our opinions.

709335,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00006AGHD,Reviewer,"[3, 4]","The breathtaking beauty of a remote area of Alaska provides the setting for this film, and the natural splendor of the surroundings offers a thought provoking contrast between the serenity of the landscape and the ugliness visited upon it by one of it's inhabitants.  In the thriller ""Insomnia,"" director Christopher Nolan examines the myriad faces of evil and the far-reaching effects of wrongdoing, whether perpetrated straightforwardly as a heinous crime, or in the ill conceived notion of subverting the law in a quest for justice.  But he also looks beyond the objectivity of premeditation at how certain physical variables can subjectively affect the psychological aspects of the duplicity.  Specifically, what happens to the body-- and especially to the mind-- when deprived of sleep for an extended period of time.  And especially when it comes at a critical juncture; at a time when, above all else, the mind must be absolutely clear and sharp, when judgments must be passed and decisions made.  Can a web of deceit, woven amid a struggle between the mind and the body, stand fast?  And if so, for how long?  How long can one prevail against the proclivities of human nature, in a place where the sun never sets, and the mind cannot find rest.L.A. detective Will Dormer (Al Pacino), and his partner, Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan), have been given a special assignment:  The investigation of the murder of a seventeen-year-old girl in the small town of Nightmute, Alaska.  Their detail comes on the heels of a certain internal affairs investigation currently being conducted within the L.A.P.D., which may involve the high-profile Dormer, a good cop who has been putting away the bad guys for more years than he can remember.  And if the I.A. affair goes south, some criminals Dormer has been instrumental in convicting may see freedom.  So the change of venue for the detectives comes at an auspicious time; sometimes distance can be a good thing.Dormer goes into the case with the confidence provided him by years on the job.  He is lucid, and on top of things immediately.  What he finds in Nightmute, however, is a killer who is not only meticulous, but who has a wild card up his sleeve and begins to play it not long after Dormer hits town.  It's the time of year when the sun never sets, and the killer realizes that it is going to affect Dormer's sleep, and subsequently, his perceptions and actions.  And he's determined to help the situation along with some untimely phone calls and some well chosen words.  Dormer's onto the game immediately, but after a couple of days of sleeplessness, his mental faculties begin to deteriorate, and it leads to a situation involving Eckhart that puts an entirely new spin on the matters at hand.  Things get sticky, and Dormer's judgment becomes questionable.  He struggles to keep himself together, because he knows one thing for certain:  The killer has crossed a line from which there is no return, and he's going to kill again.  And it's up to Dormer to stop him before it happens.As with his previous effort, ""Memento,"" Christopher Nolan has crafted and delivered a film that is emotionally stirring and initially, at least, devoid of any absolutes (or if there are any, they are soon lost in Dormer's sleeplessness induced mental haze), to which he adds a moral dilemma that makes it all entirely involving and which successfully draws the audience into the action as the story unfolds.  it becomes an incisive character study that affords you Dormer's perspective while allowing you to experience his situation seemingly first hand.  Nolan gradually takes you from the rational thought processes that to Dormer are the norm, to the murky regions of the ambiguous into which he descends as the sleeplessness overcomes and overwhelms him.  And the fact that Dormer's impaired mental state is so significant-- inasmuch as the direction it takes the story-- makes this a rather unique film; it's an interesting angle, and quite different from the usual considerations offered by the typical crime/thriller/drama.  Most importantly, Nolan knows how to present it effectively, and builds the tension in direct proportion to Dormer's descent, which maintains that necessary edge right up to the climax.By the end of the film, Pacino/Dormer really looks as though he hasn't slept in days; it's a critical aspect of the story, upon which the credibility of the film depends, and which it achieves, without question.  Some credit has to go to the make-up provided by Gitte Axen, but ultimately, what makes this film so convincing-- and such an unqualified success-- is Al Pacino's performance.  As he demonstrates here, he is arguably one of the top two leading actors in the business (the other being De Niro).  He has the ability to create a completely new character with every new film, and he's always convincing, whether taking it over-the-top (Tony Montana, ""Scarface""; Vincent Hanna, ""Heat""), using a more introspective approach (Michael Corleone, ""The Godfather"") or finding the necessary reserve that fits a particular character and makes him believable (as he does here with Will Dormer).  This is a studied portrayal, presented in subtle shadings and tone, and one that should easily earn him an Oscar nomination.Turning in a solid performance, also, is Robin Williams, who seems to be taking a page out of Pacino's book by finding the kind of restraint he needed to make his character work.  Williams has played a variety of roles in his career, but never has he played so against type as his portrayal of Walter Finch in this film; and he does it well.  He's entirely convincing-- his Finch is very real and disquietingly believable, in that his outward appearance is so normal, while in reality he is capable of deeds most vile.  His true nature is undetectable, and as such, he's your worst nightmare.  It makes Dormer's conundrum even more pronounced, and helps to make ""Insomnia"" a riveting and thoroughly engrossing film.",5,Riveting Thriller from Christopher Nolan,1022544000,"05 28,

I stated in my review of The Prestige that, that movie was possibly his weakest, and I felt that way until revisiting this film. I think Insomnia is his weakest entry overall, but it was still a fantastic thriller. Calling any of Nolan's film weaker than their counterparts doesn't quite mean the same as it would for many other filmmakers, because I like all of his films that I've seen. First of all, the pacing is surprisingly well done. His films tend to run two hours plus, but this one was just under two hours. That was great because it had a quicker pace that captured the feeling of trying to solve a murder case in the first few days (any First 48 fans out there?).

I cannot judge whether or not it does the original justice, but I can say that it is worth a watch.Al Pacino did a great, if not subdued, job as a conflicted veteran LAPD officer who recently came under scrutiny for some questionable acts he and his partner committed while on the job. What's new, it's the LAPD? Opposite of Pacino was Robin Williams as a creepy local novelist, and my was he great. Between this and One Hour Photo, I've seen a sinister side of Williams that I'd love to see more, and more of in the future. Hilary Swank rounds out the leads as an unexperienced, and eager, local officer assisting Pacino's character, Dormer, on this investigation. She's always reliable, and hardly ever outshines her co-stars. Same goes for her in this film. Aside from the effective leads, another aid to this film in setting the tone of a classic suspense novel or film was the snowy, cold, lonely Alaskan setting. Alaska, when used correctly, can be an amazingly chilling (no pun intended) setting for any bleak, mysterious, etc story. Insomnia is not as dark as what one would have grown accustomed to by Nolan's standards (literally because the sun never sets in Alaska), but because of the somber tone, it's still a dark story.The story is also pretty complex. It's not difficult to follow by any means, but the way that events unfold increasingly complicate things for our lead character, until that faithful day in all suspense thrillers where things come to a head and then pop, like a figurative pimple. It was really interesting to see Pacino's character progress through one distressing situation after another, all while battling his own demons from his past. Again though, the actors are what really drive this thriller home. Not to beat a dead horse, but Robin Williams is quite disturbing, and Hilary Swank also did quite well. The music did not stand out as much as the scores in Nolan's films usually do. This was before Nolan and Zimmer hooked up, so that's understandable. Overall, I liked it a lot. It hasn't become a classic in its genre, but it's still a great crime story and case study. It's smartly crafted, and definitely worth everyone's time.",4,The Woes of a Tortured Cop,1344816000,"08 13, 2012",2012,3121,"['Insomnia', 'bit', 'different', 'what', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'known', 'still', 'fantastic', 'notch', 'belt', 'stated', 'review', 'Prestige', 'movie', 'was', 'possibly', 'weakest', 'felt', 'way', 'revisiting', 'film', 'think', 'Insomnia', 'weakest', 'entry', 'overall', 'was', 'still', 'fantastic', 'thriller', 'Calling', 'Nolan', 'film', 'weaker', 'counterparts', ""n't"", 'quite', 'mean', 'same', 'would', 'many', 'other', 'filmmakers', 'like', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'First', 'all', 'pacing', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'done', 'films', 'tend', 'run', 'two', 'hours', 'one', 'was', 'just', 'two', 'hours', 'was', 'great', 'had', 'quicker', 'pace', 'captured', 'feeling', 'trying', 'solve', 'murder', 'case', 'first', 'few', 'days', 'First', '48', 'fans', 'there', 'movie', 'was', 'remake', 'apparently', 'was', ""n't"", 'aware', 'doing', 'research', 'remake', '1997', 'Erik', 'Skjoldbjrg', 'movie', 'same', 'name', 'can', 'not', 'judge', 'not', 'original', 'justice', 'can', 'say', 'watch.Al', 'Pacino', 'did', 'great', 'not', 'subdued', 'job', 'conflicted', 'veteran', 'LAPD', 'officer', 'who', 'recently', 'came', 'scrutiny', 'questionable', 'acts', 'partner', 'committed', 'job', 'What', 'new', 'LAPD', 'Opposite', 'Pacino', 'was', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'creepy', 'local', 'novelist', 'was', 'great', 'Between', 'One', 'Hour', 'Photo', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'sinister', 'side', 'Williams', ""'d"", 'love', 'see', 'more', 'more', 'future', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'out', 'leads', 'unexperienced', 'eager', 'local', 'officer', 'assisting', 'Pacino', 'character', 'Dormer', 'investigation', 'always', 'reliable', 'hardly', 'ever', 'co-stars', 'Same', 'film', 'Aside', 'effective', 'leads', 'aid', 'film', 'setting', 'tone', 'classic', 'suspense', 'novel', 'film', 'was', 'snowy', 'cold', 'lonely', 'Alaskan', 'setting', 'Alaska', 'when', 'used', 'correctly', 'can', 'be', 'amazingly', 'chilling', 'pun', 'intended', 'setting', 'bleak', 'mysterious', 'etc', 'story', 'Insomnia', 'not', 'as', 'dark', 'what', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'grown', 'accustomed', 'Nolan', 'standards', 'literally', 'sun', 'never', 'Alaska', 'somber', 'tone', 'still', 'dark', 'story.The', 'story', 'also', 'pretty', 'complex', 'not', 'difficult', 'follow', 'means', 'way', 'events', 'unfold', 'increasingly', 'complicate', 'things', 'lead', 'character', 'faithful', 'day', 'suspense', 'thrillers', 'where', 'things', 'come', 'head', 'then', 'pop', 'figurative', 'pimple', 'was', 'really', 'interesting', 'see', 'Pacino', 'character', 'progress', 'one', 'distressing', 'situation', 'battling', 'own', 'demons', 'past', 'Again', 'actors', 'are', 'what', 'really', 'drive', 'thriller', 'home', 'Not', 'beat', 'dead', 'horse', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'quite', 'disturbing', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'also', 'did', 'quite', 'well', 'music', 'did', 'not', 'stand', 'out', 'as', 'much', 'scores', 'Nolan', 'films', 'usually', 'do', 'was', 'Nolan', 'Zimmer', 'hooked', 'up', 'understandable', 'Overall', 'liked', 'lot', ""n't"", 'become', 'classic', 'genre', 'still', 'great', 'crime', 'story', 'case', 'study', 'smartly', 'crafted', 'definitely', 'worth', 'everyone', 'time']",Insomnia Region 2
709342,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B00006AGHD,RMurray847,"[1, 1]","The initial, basic plot of INSOMNIA is fairly conventional.  Al Pacino, a tired, grizzled cop, and his partner, come to Alaska to help solve a particularly heinous murder.  They're chasing a psycho.  Right there is enough story for many movies.But this movie isn't satisfied with anything conventional.  When Pacino comes close to capturing the bad guy, he makes a HUGE mistake and then makes the bigger mistake of covering up for himself...and is witnessed in this crime by the murderer himself.  Thus, Pacino must now track the murderer to also prevent his secret from getting out.  Does this mean killing the murderer?The movie is set in Alaska, during the time of year when the sun isn't setting.  Pacino can't get to sleep, and his guilt-ridden insomnia seeps into his performance in a nearly tangible way.  We see his ever increasing weariness.  He's a good cop who may have taken some shortcuts in the past, but we sense that he's smart and on the right side.  His mistake was an accident followed by a lapse in judgement.  But as his weariness covers him, we feel his despair for his soul.It's rare to see a ""crime"" movie that delves so deeply into the psyche of its main characters.  This is truly a great Pacino performance...he doesn't go over the top, and we understand once again why he's one of our greats.  Robin Williams excellently plays the psycho-killer.  He's not as creepy as he was in ONE HOUR PHOTO, but he is very effective, and makes an unusual foil for Pacino.  Hillary Swank plays the local law officer who admirers Pacino, even as she begins to question his story.  Martin Donovan plays Pacino's partner in a small part that he carries off VERY well.  This guy needs more high profile parts.The movie doesn't move at a very brisk pace, but for intelligent, adult movie goers, it is jam-packed with psychological action. And there is very nice chase scene about halfway through, where Pacino is pursuing Williams over a river covered with logs.  It's something we've not seen in a movie before.

709343,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00006AGHD,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[4, 7]","Insomnia (Christopher Nolan, 2002)I hate to think it's true, but having now seen Chris Nolan's other two films, Following and Insomnia, I'm starting to think Memento--one of the finest films ever made--was a one-shot deal.Insomnia, based on Erik Skoldbjaerg's brilliant 1997 film starring Stellan Skarsjard (of Good Will Hunting and The Glass House). Nolan's version--executive-produced by professional remake mangler Steven Soderbergh, who should be boiled in his own juices for what he did to Solaris--puts an on-the-edge Al Pacino in Skarsjard's role, and Pacino is the best thing about this movie hands-down. It's the first time since Dog Day Afternoon that he's played a character who's this unhinged both in his head and by the events around him, and we, the viewing audience, have sorely missed Mr. Crazy Pacino, thankyouverymuch. Unfortunately, Pacino is not given nearly as much to work with as was Skarsjard, and what he is given is as anemic as a nineteenth-century hypochodriac prescribed a convalescence of a length to be determined. (If only someone had done the same for Nolan.)All of the motivation of Skarsjard's character has disappeared (some for the sake of'-ugh'-'streamlining,' and some because American audiences, according to Hollywood, would have a real problem seeing a character with some of Skarsjard's character's nastier qualities portrayed in anything like a positive light), all of the ambiguity of two key scenes (the shooting in the fog and the ride to the dump) have disappeared, a key scene showing the depth to which the detective has sunk is lessened in its intensity, and most heretically, the ending is destroyed, all of which lead to a film that, had it been made on its own, may have been watchable. As a remake, however, it pales, and greatly, in comparison to the brilliant force unleashed upon us by Erik Skjoldbaerg in 1997. **",2,Heresy.,1038873600,"12 3, 2002",2002,1873,"['Insomnia', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', '2002', 'hate', 'think', 'true', 'having', 'now', 'seen', 'Chris', 'Nolan', 'other', 'two', 'films', 'Following', 'Insomnia', ""'m"", 'starting', 'think', 'Memento', 'one', 'finest', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'was', 'one-shot', 'deal.Insomnia', 'based', 'Erik', 'Skoldbjaerg', 'brilliant', '1997', 'film', 'starring', 'Stellan', 'Skarsjard', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'Glass', 'House', 'Nolan', 'version', 'executive-produced', 'professional', 'remake', 'mangler', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'boiled', 'own', 'juices', 'what', 'did', 'Solaris', 'on-the-edge', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Skarsjard', 'role', 'Pacino', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'hands-down', 'first', 'time', 'Dog', 'Day', 'Afternoon', 'played', 'character', 'who', 'unhinged', 'head', 'events', 'viewing', 'audience', 'have', 'sorely', 'missed', 'Mr.', 'Crazy', 'Pacino', 'thankyouverymuch', 'Unfortunately', 'Pacino', 'not', 'given', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'work', 'as', 'was', 'Skarsjard', 'what', 'given', 'as', 'anemic', 'nineteenth-century', 'hypochodriac', 'prescribed', 'convalescence', 'length', 'be', 'determined', 'only', 'someone', 'had', 'done', 'same', 'Nolan', 'motivation', 'Skarsjard', 'character', 'disappeared', 'sake', ""of'-ugh'-'streamlining"", 'American', 'audiences', 'according', 'Hollywood', 'would', 'have', 'real', 'problem', 'seeing', 'character', 'Skarsjard', 'character', 'nastier', 'qualities', 'portrayed', 'anything', 'positive', 'light', 'ambiguity', 'two', 'key', 'scenes', 'shooting', 'fog', 'ride', 'dump', 'have', 'disappeared', 'key', 'scene', 'showing', 'depth', 'detective', 'sunk', 'lessened', 'intensity', 'most', 'heretically', 'ending', 'destroyed', 'lead', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'own', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'watchable', 'remake', 'however', 'greatly', 'comparison', 'brilliant', 'force', 'unleashed', 'Erik', 'Skjoldbaerg', '1997', '**']",Insomnia Region 2

709346,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00006AGHD,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 3]","Like the 1997 Norwegian film on which it is based, ""Insomnia"" is a superbly crafted crime thriller, one that is more concerned with the psychological complexities of its main character than with the minutiae of the criminal investigation itself - though the details of the case are fascinating in their own right as well.Al Pacino delivers his finest performance in years in the role of Detective Will Dormer, a seasoned homicide investigator brought in from Los Angeles to help solve the murder of a seventeen-year-old high school student in rural Alaska.  The problem is that, back in L.A., Dormer is facing some heat of his own from LAPD's Internal Affairs Division, which is beginning a probe into the propriety of some of the veteran's actions on the job.  Back in Alaska, while on a stakeout to nab the possible killer, Dormer becomes disoriented in the fog and ends up accidentally shooting and killing his longtime partner, a colleague who, Dormer had just learned, was planning to cooperate with the IA investigation back home, thereby bringing about the possible ruination of Dormer's career and reputation.  Caught off guard by this sudden turn of events, Dormer suddenly finds himself in the unfamiliar role of perpetrator, looking for ways to cover up a ""crime"" rather than unravel it.  One of the compelling themes of the film is its insistence that only a very thin line separates those who commit crimes from those whose job it is to uncover and prosecute the wrongdoers.Dormer is stunned to find how quickly and easily he can cross over that line.  The outstanding screenplay by Nikolaj Frobenius and Erik Skjoldbjaerg really knows how to get into the minds and emotions of its characters, particularly in the case of Dormer, who turns out to be one of the most psychologically complex and fascinating figures we have encountered in the movies in a long, long time.  Here is a man who has built his name and career on knowing how to unravel complex crimes, always priding himself on being one step ahead of the criminals who are so convinced they have left no traces behind which could point to their guilt.  Yet, now Dormer finds himself in the same boat, as he anxiously looks for ways to hide the fact that he shot - even accidentally - a man who had the power to bring him down.  As the story develops, Dormer, whom we assume at the start is innocent of the charges for which he is being investigated by Internal Affairs, begins to seem less and less innocent and more and more capable of doing just exactly what it is he is being accused of.  Yet, the triumph of the film is that Pacino and the screenwriters never let us feel we know all there is to know about Dormer.  He is truly a man of mystery, so tightly coiled that even he doesn't know or understand all that is going on in the deepest, darkest recesses of his psyche.  By setting the film in the summer near the Arctic Circle, the filmmakers are able to provide a natural phenomenon to help aggravate Dormer's potentially psychotic condition.  Like Mersault in Camus' ""The Stranger,"" Dormer becomes strangely disoriented by the oppressive effect of the sun, though, in this case, it is the lack of a night that drives Dormer crazy through insomnia.  As the virtually indistinguishable days and nights pass without sleep, Dormer begins to suffer from delirium and hallucinations, making it all the harder for him to separate truth from fiction, fantasy from reality and - most importantly - right from wrong and morality from immortality.  When the killer reveals to Dormer that he saw him shoot his partner, Dormer finds himself faced with the ethical crisis of turning the culprit in or of bonding with him as ""partners"" in mutual criminality and guilt.  Here again the once-clear and distinct line between investigator and criminal suddenly ceases to exist.Pacino, stoop-shouldered and craggy-faced - the prominent bags under his eyes a physical testimony to his weariness and sleeplessness - plumbs the very depths of this infinitely rich and complex character.  In fact, there is nothing less than an outstanding performance in the entire film.  Robin Williams brings an air of restraint and understatement to the part of Walter Finch, the killer who plays a cat-and-mouse mind game with the sleepless, intellectually vulnerable Dormer, exploiting Dormer's weakened state to his own advantage.  Hilary Swank brings a warmth and compassion to her role as Ellie Burr, an eager-to-please detective who has long idolized Dormer and his work, who also has to make an emotionally wrenching choice near the end of the film.  Finally, Maura Tierney makes her few scenes count as a sympathetic innkeeper whom Dormer turns to as the person who happens to be handy at the moment when the need to unburden his soul spontaneously arises within him.As the film's director, Christopher Nolan establishes and maintains a mood of quiet intensity throughout the course of the film.  Helped by the stark, but somewhat oppressively gloomy beauty of the Alaskan outpost setting, Nolan makes us experience the same sense of unease and disorientation Dormer himself feels.  Nolan has chosen to punctuate his film with a series of highly charged, intensely dramatic confrontation scenes between Dorman and any number of the other characters in the film.  The film never wanes in interest for even a moment of its running time.It is an enormous pleasure to see a film as intelligently conceived and executed as ""Insomnia.""  Kudos to everyone involved with making this such a rare and fascinating movie going experience.  But the greatest thanks goes to Al Pacino himself.  He has never been so good.",4,great psychological thriller,1024185600,"06 16, 2002",2002,5660,"['1997', 'Norwegian', 'film', 'based', 'Insomnia', 'superbly', 'crafted', 'crime', 'thriller', 'one',

This isn't a ""thriller"" in the shallow, slasher sense of the word.  It's purely psychological, and that's what I prefer.Will Dormer is an aging Los Angeles cop who travels to a small Alaska town to solve the murder of a teenaged girl, Kay Connell.  Once there, he encounters local cops who barely scratch the suface of the necessary investigation, yet seem reluctant to welcome his expertise.  Only one cop, the rookie Ellie Burke, is thrilled to finally be investigating ""real crime"" and even more in awe of the veteran Dormer.The case quickly turns to the victim's boyfriend, Randy (played by Jonathan Jackson, who has come a long way since his General Hospital days).  Abusive, angry, and belligerent, Randy seems like the natural choice, especially since he doesn't care to admit he was actually betraying Kay as she was being murdered.  Not long into the investigation, Dormer sets a trap for the killer.  The ploy, however, goes horribly wrong when Dormer's partner is (accidentally?) shot.  This is when the plot begins its tantalizing, teasing turns.  Dormer does his best to cover up the true facts of his partner's death and the real killer of Kay Connell, but small-town cop Ellie is smarter than anyone wants to admit . . .Robin Williams has a deliciously freaky role in this film (this isn't Patch Adams, folks) as Walter Finch, Kay Connell's secret confidant.  His performance isn't to be missed; indeed, it's the highlight of the film.The film's setting was quite ingenious--Alaska, land where the sun never sets on the day or the problems in Dormer's life.  His conscience keeps him awake, as much as he tries to blame the sun.  The scenery is absolutely gorgeous, too.I'm sorry if some people expected this to be a thriller of the blood and guts variety.  If that's what you're expecting, stay home.  This film is a true nail-biter and I just start several times because of sudden movements . . .

While I do not believe it has been remastered, they obviously took it from a very clean and perfect first master.  You will find no aliasing, artifacts, banding or stair stepping anywhere in this film.  The color grading is perfect with its earthy tones and slightly crushed blacks which all contribute to the exhausted and morally confused Al Pacino's character.  There are many dark scenes yet details are readily apparent.  The Mbps rate appeared to average in the low to mid twenties and that is certainly good enough for this intriguing and often overlooked film.  The fog during many scenes does not come across as faked CGI and really draws the viewer into the claustrophobia and lost atmosphere.AUDIO...The DTS HD MA 5.1 is a lossless audio codec that is superior to any lossy codec that you find on Standard Def DVDs.  The dialogue is always transparent with clear, crisp pronunciation and properly balanced volume with the sound-score.  There is some nice discreet channeling to the front surrounds but it is used sparingly as this is a dialogue driven film but there are a few scenes where the front and rear surrounds, as well as the LFE channel, are brought in to create a nice atmospheric ambience.  The surrounds are primarily used for ambience and little use for the LFE channel is clearly by design.  The audio is as good as it can be expected to be for a film of this type.EXTRAS..One deleted scene whose audio level, despite being DD 2.0 was far too low in volume.  I had to really push it up.  The scene itself wasn't much so I can see why they cut it.  Many other extras in the form of interviews and dialogues with Al Pacino, the director and several others.  I can't say I have watched them all but the ones I did watch were worthy.All in all, this is about the best you are going to get for Insomnia and that's not bad.

709366,A1TL34XG2HNMQ6,B00006AGHD,Sursubbu,"[3, 4]","I must say I'm rather disappointed by what seems to be a typical Hollywood &quot;give `em a bigger budget and dumb `em down&quot; treatment of new talents like Nolan. This film, a remake of a 1997 Norwegian film, is quite clearly a mainstream studio product and a waste of a rather promising idea.***May contain SPOILERS***The plot begins with the arrival of a pair of Homicide detectives in an Alaskan town to solve the murder of a local girl. Pacino plays the older cop Dormer who rendered insomniac in the perpetual sunlight of the season. An early lead into the killer's whereabouts leads to a stakeout at a cabin hideaway - a treacherous fog befuddles sight and Dormer ends up shooting his partner, apparently by accident. He places the blame on the escaped killer and the investigations are continued. Dormer has the guilt of his partner's death to compound his insomnia and another person knows the truth of the incident - the killer, who has seen Dormer fire the fatal shot. A cat-and-mouse game ensues between the two, with Dormer alternating between hunting down the murderer and covering up his own tracks, while the killer (Robin Williams as Walter Finch, a pulp writer) aims to psyche Dormer into letting him escape - the two end up working out a deal where a third person is framed for the crime. But things go awry in this setup and the film abruptly makes towards a (silly) shootout climax in which Dormer and Finch gun each other down.The main problem IMO with this film is that it gives off a thorough sense of `under-achievement' in every aspect of it. There were a thousand ways little and big in which the visual and emotional core of the film could have been imbued with substance but really all that seems to have fallen by the wayside if at all considered.1. The look of most of the film is so utterly generic it's disheartening. The aspect of a sparsely populated settlement who live a season of perpetual sunlight is dealt with in a perfunctory manner that sucks away most of the uniqueness of the film. This should have been a focal point that defined the sensibility and emotional core of the film and it was just thrown off as a two-scene gimmick reference. The entire concept of `light-as-darkness' blinding and disorienting Dormer's character is never approached to an extent worth the mention. Without that really what was the point of shooting the film in Alaska - to show that Alaska's cranky teens and crazy killers were like those in any other part of the country?2. Pacino seems to have been selected for the role of the haggard Dormer simply because his entire current career seems veered towards playing haggard old men. This is not to say that he does a bad job, he gets pretty effective in some of the scenes that come immediately after the partner's killing but really at very few points does one feel the turmoil and disorientation of Dormer and there are a few bits of sleepwalk acting even for an insomniac character.3. Robin William's writer-killer character is again a stereotype that has been seen in umpteen movies made before. I really wish they had taken pains over giving his character a different edge - But we're still stuck with the generic loony-killer.4. The clean-cut rookie cop who's a fan of Dormer (Hilary Swank) seems like a throwaway character although one does not fault Swank's performance. The film would have been tighter in the absence of such extraneous parts.5. The film lacks any real sophistication relying on cheap `oooh blood' shots to appear edgy.6. The climax is a total no-brainer. I'm informed that the Norwegian original ends on a morally ambiguous note with the cop getting away with his escapade. Hollywood of course shies away from such subtleties and we're subjected to a pointless gun-battle in the aftermath of which a dying Dormer advises Swank to not `lose her way (towards truth, justice and the American way, one supposes)'",2,Cure for Insomnia,1077667200,"02 25, 2004",2004,3912,"['must', 'say', ""'m"", 'rather', 'disappointed', 'what', 'be', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'quot', 'give', 'em', 'bigger', 'budget', 'dumb', 'em', 'down', 'quot', 'treatment', 'new', 'talents', 'Nolan', 'film', 'remake', '1997', 'Norwegian', 'film', 'quite', 'clearly', 'mainstream', 'studio', 'product', 'waste', 'rather', 'promising', 'idea', '***May', 'contain', 'SPOILERS***The', 'plot', 'arrival', 'pair', 'Homicide', 'detectives', 'Alaskan', 'town', 'solve', 'murder', 'local', 'girl', 'Pacino', 'older', 'cop', 'Dormer', 'who', 'rendered', 'insomniac', 'perpetual', 'sunlight', 'season', 'early', 'lead', 'killer', 'whereabouts', 'stakeout', 'cabin', 'hideaway', 'treacherous', 'fog', 'befuddles', 'sight', 'Dormer', 'up', 'shooting', 'partner', 'apparently', 'accident', 'blame', 'escaped', 'killer', 'investigations', 'are', 'continued', 'Dormer', 'guilt', 'partner', 'death', 'compound', 'insomnia', 'person', 'truth', 'incident', 'killer', 'who', 'seen', 'Dormer', 'fire', 'fatal', 'shot', 'cat-and-mouse', 'game', 'ensues', 'two', 'Dormer', 'alternating', 'hunting', 'down', 'murderer', 'covering', 'up', 'own', 'tracks', 'killer', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Walter', 'Finch', 'pulp', 'writer', 'psyche', 'Dormer', 'letting', 'escape', 'two', 'end', 'up', 'working', 'out', 'deal', 'where', 'third', 'person', 'framed', 'crime', 'things', 'go', 'awry', 'setup', 'film', 'abruptly', 'towards', 'silly', 'shootout', 'climax', 'Dormer', 'Finch', 'gun', 'other', 'down.The', 'main', 'problem', 'IMO', 'film', 'thorough', 'sense', 'under-achievement', 'aspect', 'were', 'thousand', 'ways', 'little', 'big', 'visual', 'emotional', 'core', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'imbued', 'substance', 'really', 'have', 'fallen', 'wayside', 'considered.1', 'look', 'most', 'film', 'so', 'utterly', 'generic', 'disheartening', 'aspect', 'sparsely', 'populated', 'settlement', 'who', 'live', 'season', 'perpetual', 'sunlight', 'dealt', 'perfunctory', 'manner', 'away', 'most', 'uniqueness', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'focal', 'point', 'defined', 'sensibility', 'emotional', 'core', 'film', 'was', 'just', 'thrown', 'off', 'two-scene', 'gimmick', 'reference', 'entire', 'concept', 'light-as-darkness', 'blinding', 'disorienting', 'Dormer', 'character', 'never', 'approached', 'extent', 'mention', 'really', 'what', 'was', 'point', 'shooting', 'film', 'Alaska', 'show', 'Alaska', 'cranky', 'teens', 'crazy', 'killers', 'were', 'other', 'part', 'country', '2', 'Pacino', 'have', 'been', 'selected', 'role', 'haggard', 'Dormer', 'simply', 'entire', 'current', 'career', 'veered', 'towards', 'playing', 'haggard', 'old', 'men', 'not', 'say', 'bad', 'job', 'pretty', 'effective', 'scenes', 'come', 'immediately', 'partner', 'killing', 'really', 'very', 'few', 'points', 'one', 'feel', 'turmoil', 'disorientation', 'Dormer', 'are', 'few', 'bits', 'sleepwalk', 'acting', 'even', 'insomniac', 'character.3', 'Robin', 'William', 'writer-killer', 'character', 'again', 'stereotype', 'been', 'seen', 'umpteen', 'movies', 'made', 'really', 'wish', 'had', 'taken', 'pains', 'giving', 'character', 'different', 'edge', ""'re"", 'still', 'stuck', 'generic', 'loony-killer.4', 'clean-cut', 'rookie', 'cop', 'who', 'fan', 'Dormer', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'throwaway', 'character', 'one', 'not', 'fault', 'Swank', 'performance', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'tighter', 'absence', 'such', 'extraneous', 'parts.5', 'film', 'real', 'sophistication', 'relying', 'cheap', 'oooh', 'blood', 'shots', 'appear', 'edgy.6', 'climax', 'total', 'no-brainer', ""'m"", 'informed', 'Norwegian', 'original', 'ends', 'morally', 'ambiguous', 'note', 'cop', 'getting', 'away', 'escapade', 'Hollywood', 'course', 'shies', 'away', 'such', 'subtleties', ""'re"", 'subjected', 'pointless', 'gun-battle', 'aftermath', 'dying', 'Dormer', 'Swank', 'not', 'lose', 'way', 'truth', 'justice', 'American', 'way', 'one']",Insomnia Region 2

Al is frazzled and dog-tired before he even gets there.  He soon finds out that this is the season of 24-hour sunshine.  (Though it is to be noted, the only time the sun really shines is in Al&#65533;s bedroom.) To add to his woes, there is an Internal Affairs investigation whirling about him in L.A., and his partner has just told Al that he is going to turn in evidence against him for his unorthodox methods.  They are met at the plane by super-rookie Hilary Swank who is suitably awed at meeting the great detective.  Some snappy early detective work has the police and detectives on the track of the killer in a remote wooded area.  He disappears into a fog; visibility is near zero, and Al accidentally (?) shoots and kills his partner and then covers up his culpability.The film intensifies the horrendous pressure Pacino is suffering by showing his frenetic sleuthing coupled with his total inability to sleep.  The final twist of the screw is the murderer contacting him with a blackmail attempt&#65533;he has witnessed the killing of Al&#65533;s partner. Enter Robin Williams.Director Christopher Nolan does an excellent job of portraying Pacino&#65533;s inevitable crackup with lightning fast quick cuts and a jittering scene of audio hallucinations.  The stark and pearly ambiance of the Alaskan scenery is shown in magnificent cinematography.  In spite of the wonders and impressiveness, I don&#65533;t think I&#65533;d want to visit any time soon.  I kept thinking: this is high summer, and all I am seeing is snow melt and people running around in their woolies.The movie has good pace, though if Robin Williams had entered the action earlier, it would have been an improvement.  Pacino overwhelms.  Nolan gives him close-up after close-up until I definitely wanted a little less face time.  Williams gave some much-needed balance.

709369,A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP,B00006AGHD,Takis Tz.,"[0, 0]","Allthough a lot of people avoided this film in the movie theaters (myself included) because of the rather dodgy choice of the casting Robin Williams as a killer, it appears that these fears were totally unjustified.Insomnia is a film that contributes nicely to a genre desperate gor oxygen, that of the old and classic ""dtetective film"".It works because it incorporates several interesting angles to keep you interested throughout as well as guessing.An Alaskan town as the setting for a murder case where an L.A detective is brought in? Nice touch.A killer not played by the usual baddies but by ""Ms Doubtfire""-Robin Williams? Better touch even.A detective who cant seem to get any sleep under the never setting sun in Alaska even if his life depended on it? Good, really good.It's mainly those 3 axes that fuel the engine of this story and, of course, the superb acting of Pacino and even Williams who settles in his killer role incredibly convincingly. It wouldnt matter, in fact, how Pacino came across here had Williams not fit in with his role. The whole thing would've collapsed in ruins.But that's exactly it, Williams plays the loser-small-time-author-turned-killer perfectly and from there on it's a smooth ride all the way to the end.This is a film by dierctor Chritopher Nolan who filmed Memento and if u thought that Memento avoided any cliches so does Insomnia. Insomnia HAD to avoid the cliches because ths is genre that has gone stale exactly because it rode the cliches for far too long.Pacino's character is one that grows edgier every 5 minutes the film progresses no doubt NOT helped by his lack of sleep. He's also a character that has a lot on the line as he's been sent to Alaska because of internal tension in his department and because he's got a great reputation to protect.That reputation takes a huge dent as he winds up killing his partner in the case (by mistake? not? not sure) and this becomes the killer's leverage point in a way that provides for numerous twists.Williams's character is one that has become a murderer ""because it happened"" and he seems to have great adjustability potentials as he slips into his role like a snake would around its victim.

Although Christopher Nolan is certainly no Hitchcock, this intense suspense-thriller possesses the some of the qualities that make a true classic.  The story winds through the nightless town of Nightmute, Alaska, where LAPD detective Will Dormer (played by Al Pacino is an only par performance) investigates a troubling serial killer case.  When the investigation takes a sudden, twisting turn, Dormer not only is in pursuit of a killer, but is up against the sleepless psychological trauma that is disrupting his every move.As Dormer gets closer and closer to the truth, he comes across a startlingly eerie author (Robin Williams), who happens to have vital information about concerning one of the victim's death.  As Dormer becomes more involved with the author, his paranoia grows increasingly unstable.  Williams steals the show throughout the second half of the film, portraying the role with ease; a haunting character that must have crept mightily out of his soul.  Hillary Swank is a some-what misused rookie officer who is one step behind Dormer in solving the case and her peformance is only fair.Director Nolan uses the excellent Hilary Seitz to his advantage, plotting Dormer's fears and ambitions, tooling Pacino and Williams's characters in a battle of good and evil, yet the good and the evil are presented in an enigmatic, vague fashion that will keep viewers guessing.

They're there to solve a brutal and calculated murder, but circumstances lead them down a different path.

Instead, I was presented with a complex character drama in addition to a back and forth trade-off of psychological mind games between the most unlikely duo I would ever have thought possible. Al Pacino is a given with his extensive track record and undeniable screen presence. His tact, detail to the little things, and natural vigor has always made him a great actor to watch on screen. But my biggest surprise was in Robin Williams. I've not seen his work in One Hour Photo, but his character in this film is definitely the darkest and most poignantly disturbing role I've seen him do to date. At times he's like a ticking time-bomb of undistilled rage and mounting frustration just waiting to explode. And yet, for a very good majority of his screen time he displays an almost creepy sense of control that manages to keep him aloof just when you think it's over. His character's natural ability of observation and the twisted kind of logic he possesses make for a great game of cat and mouse that keeps you suspended till the very end. The parallels between their personalities, the circumstances that brought them together, and the raw tension that propels them both to the point of breaking are all part of another finely-woven web that has a little bit of everything I like in a detective story. And while in somewhat of a limited role, Hilary Swank provides for a great sense of conscience and perspective in opposition to the insomniac behaviors of both Pacino and Williams' characters. I was surprised at how brisk the movie progressed having only seen it for the first time as of this review. It's a dark and very well-written piece of psychological thriller with just the right balance of drama and emotion.Video - 4.5As mentioned above, this BD is actually my first-ever viewing of the film. And while I don't have any theatrical or DVD experiences in mind for comparison, I still have to say the film looks wonderful. Wally Pfister's photography gets an excellent transfer, with bold, bold colors being the highlight of the video. From the very beginning of the movie when Pacino's character is flying over the mountains of Alaska (or wherever they filmed in British Columbia), we get a crystal clear image full of depth and detail. The aforementioned colors look especially lush throughout the countryside showcasing an array of greens, browns, and grays for that very laid-back Alaskan outdoorsy look. Black levels are deep and inky, while contrast is proportioned perfectly to give certain scenes ample dramatic and photographic effect. Skin tones remain very natural exposing a good deal of facial features from the wrinkles of a worn-down Pacino to the eerie smile on Williams' face when we get that side shot of him on the ferry. Overall image detail maintains a faithful and accurate level of sharpness for a lot of the indoor settings and is marred by little bit of edge enhancement, but isn't too distracting. My only gripe for an otherwise perfect picture is the period of frame-shaking during the funeral scene, but everything else is relatively flawless.Audio - 4.5Much like the video, I found the audio to be excellent as well. While a good majority of the film is dialogue, what few instances there are of surround usage via background noise, ambient town activity, running water, shuffling footsteps, or creaking wood, do their fair share of creating a deceptively buoyant DTS-HD track. Separation of said noises does a great job panning across the screen just as you'd see/hear them from the perspective of the camera. Directionality doesn't get a whole lot of work, but does so admirably when given the opportunity. A lot of it is done mainly through the sounds of nature and in combination with a tense, and sometimes haunting, score by David Julyan. But perhaps my favorite element, though to no surprise considering its rudimentary requirement, is the dialogue. Pacino, in conjunction to his unique acting, also has that very distinct raspy voice, which I have to say couldn't sound more perfect, especially for this type of movie. Meanwhile, Williams with a much more low-key performance, voice-wise, sounds equally impressive be it on screen or over the phone (again, it's creepy to hear him be.. so creepy). And for as good as the track sounds, the one detractor would have to be the LFEs. They're not bad, by any means, but for the limitations of what the movie is, their just isn't a whole lot of instances where strong bass is required outside of music and the occasional dramatic boom effect for the insomnia kicking in.Extras - 4.0There actually isn't a big abundance of production features aside from the set design and cinematography pieces, but they're informative enough about a lot of the technical side of things: locations chosen, things they had to build for said locations, types of filming techniques used to counteract elements of nature, and so on. There's also a quaint face-to-face conversation between Nolan and Pacino where Pacino basically gives pointers and little lessons he learned throughout his years of acting to Nolan, who seems very interested in the veteran's words. However, the real meat lies in the very informative commentaries: one by Nolan for the film itself and then one mishmash of selected scenes/commentaries by Hilary Swank and other members of the production crew. By far amongst the more interestingly arranged commentaries I've seen to date, Nolan gives insight for the entire project by going in the order of shooting, rather than the order of editing. What the production features lack in depth, Nolan more than makes up for it by explaining various aspects such as shooting, writing, casting, editing, and a wealth of other very informative tidbits relevant to the film. The scene-specific commentaries add some extra depth and perspective, mostly from a writing and shooting point, but are worth giving a listen to as well. Personally, though, I would've loved to have see a longer, more candid interview with Williams and hear the kinds of things he did to prepare for the role, as well as what he thought of his character, etc.Overall - 4.5I have to admit, as widely known as he is for his more mainstream titles (like The Prestige, Batman, and Inception), I have to say I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed Insomnia. It's an excellent combination of the calculated thriller aspects most people know him for, but also for, in my opinion, an equally excellent amount of character and psychological elements. For what handful of movies I've seen him in (still need to catch up on his classics), I never get tired of Al Pacino. And for always being the funny guy, I'm shocked at how good of a performance Robin Williams provided as well. With near-reference A/V quality and a great set of extras heralded by a very hearty Nolan commentary, Insomnia comes highly recommended.",5,Insomnia (Blu-ray),1283817600,"09 7,

709385,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B00006AGHD,Trevor Willsmer,"[0, 0]","Christopher Nolan's 2002 remake of Insomina is sadly his weakest film in an otherwise impressive filmography. The main problem is the relentless softening and sentimentalising of the material: Pacino's cop is much more sociable and wise rather than the Skaarsgard's morally empty cold fish, and is consequently much less interesting. Nolan keeps Pacino's shouty moments to a minimum and he does a much more impressive job of the sleep deprivation, but the audience-friendly characterization results in a clich?d stereotype on a predictable journey to inevitable redemption.Sadly, the dilution doesn't end with Pacino but runs throughout the film. In this version - for those familiar with the original - the dog is already dead to avoid anything that might alienate us from the hero, the women are mostly father confessor figures, the hotel receptionist IS polite to the shot man, there's no kitten scene, Hilary Swank is saddled with a horrible ""I know you're a good cop even if you don't"" scene that lacks the cold condemnation and loss of trust of the original's finale and, most damagingly, it's strongly implied that the girl's murder was not accidental, which draws a line between cop and killer. A couple of key scenes are badly directed, most notably the shooting in the fog that highlights Nolan's problems with action scenes (although there is one good chase over logs in the river).There are, however, strong points, mostly once Robin Williams enters the scene. The film does briefly address the complicity between cop and killer and takes interesting detours from the original, but it's still a film that works for a couple of reels at a time then goes off the boil for another couple of reels before staging another recovery.",3,Al Pacino excels but Christopher Nolan stumbles,1145750400,"04 23, 2006",2006,1738,"['Christopher', 'Nolan', '2002', 'remake', 'Insomina', 'sadly', 'weakest', 'film', 'otherwise', 'impressive', 'filmography', 'main', 'problem', 'relentless', 'softening', 'sentimentalising', 'material', 'Pacino', 'cop', 'much', 'more', 'sociable', 'wise', 'rather', 'Skaarsgard', 'morally', 'empty', 'cold', 'fish', 'consequently', 'much', 'less', 'interesting', 'Nolan', 'Pacino', 'shouty', 'moments', 'minimum', 'much', 'more', 'impressive', 'job', 'sleep', 'deprivation', 'audience-friendly', 'characterization', 'results', 'clich', 'd', 'stereotype', 'predictable', 'journey', 'inevitable', 'redemption.Sadly', 'dilution', ""n't"", 'end', 'Pacino', 'film', 'version', 'familiar', 'original', 'dog', 'already', 'dead', 'avoid', 'anything', 'might', 'alienate', 'hero', 'women', 'are', 'mostly', 'father', 'confessor', 'figures', 'hotel', 'receptionist', 'IS', 'polite', 'shot', 'man', 'kitten', 'scene', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'saddled', 'horrible', 'know', ""'re"", 'good', 'cop', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'scene', 'cold', 'condemnation', 'loss', 'trust', 'original', 'finale', 'most', 'damagingly', 'strongly', 'implied', 'girl', 'murder', 'was', 'not', 'accidental', 'line', 'cop', 'killer', 'couple', 'key', 'scenes', 'are', 'badly', 'directed', 'most', 'notably', 'shooting', 'fog', 'Nolan', 'problems', 'action', 'scenes', 'one', 'good', 'chase', 'logs', 'river', 'are', 'however', 'strong', 'points', 'mostly', 'once', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'scene', 'film', 'briefly', 'address', 'complicity', 'cop', 'killer', 'interesting', 'detours', 'original', 'still', 'film', 'couple', 'reels', 'time', 'then', 'boil', 'couple', 'reels', 'staging', 'recovery']",Insomnia Region 2

709392,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B00006AGHD,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[1, 1]","SPOILERS:A great thriller from Christopher Nolan, ""Insomnia"" focuses on a corrupt police officer Will Dormer(Al Pacino) called in to assist pursuing a killer (Robin Williams)in a small Alaska town. When Dormer shoots his partner Hap (Martin Donovan) by accident during the pursuit, he frantically tries to cover it up as a younger, local police officer (Hilary Swank)begins to piece together what happened. Dormer isn't really sure after being sleep deprived if he did it by accident or on purpose.END OF SPOILERS:Although ""Insomnia"" wasn't written by Nolan (like most of his films), it fits the type of morally complex thrillers that Nolan has directed since the beginning of his career. Al Pacino gives a great performance as Dormer the L.A. cop troubled by what he's done and what waits him back home. Williams gives a chilling performance in what amounts to a supporting role in the film. The film was adapted from a script written by Nikolaj Frobenius and Erik Skjoldbjaer and the American version keeps what worked so well in the original 1997 film but also allows Nolan and Pacino to bring their own personalities to the project.The Blu-ray transfer looks exceptionally good with nice detail, depth and accurate colors. There are some minor problems with edge enhancement and ringing that crop up from time to time but, on the whole, this is an extremely satisfying presentation of the film.The audio is a stand out as well with a strong 5.1 DTS mix. The long silences, atmospheric effects, dialogue and  David Julyan's outstanding moody score all benefit from the presentation here.There are also subtitles English,French, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Spanish, Portuguese and German.We get a terrific commentary track from the director with an unusual presentation on Blu-ray which I don't want to spoil particularly if you're a fan of Nolan's work.We also get scene specific commentary from Swank and the writer of the American version of the film Hilary Seitz along with Wally Pfister (who the film), the film editor and production designer. Each provides some unique and intersting comments that nicely compliment the film. This scene specific commentary runs just under 45 minutes.We also get four featurettes on the production of the film that, while short, are informative but they are presented in SD (and are ported over from the DVD).There's also a single deleted scene and a stills gallery presented in HD.""Insomnia"" is an exceptional thriller with a strong performances by Pacino and Williams, as well as, terrific direction by Nolan.Highly recommended.",5,"A detective on edge, suffering from insomnia, pursuing a killer  in Nolan's terrific thriller",1364947200,"04 3, 2013",2013,2572,"['SPOILERS', 'great', 'thriller', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'Insomnia', 'corrupt', 'police', 'officer', 'Will', 'Dormer', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'called', 'assist', 'pursuing', 'killer', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'small', 'Alaska', 'town', 'When', 'Dormer', 'shoots', 'partner', 'Hap', 'Martin', 'Donovan', 'accident', 'pursuit', 'frantically', 'cover', 'up', 'younger', 'local', 'police', 'officer', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'piece', 'together', 'what', 'happened', 'Dormer', ""n't"", 'really', 'sure', 'being', 'sleep', 'deprived', 'did', 'accident', 'purpose.END', 'SPOILERS', 'Insomnia', 'was', ""n't"", 'written', 'Nolan', 'most', 'films', 'type', 'morally', 'complex', 'thrillers', 'Nolan', 'directed', 'beginning', 'career', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'great', 'performance', 'Dormer', 'L.A.', 'cop', 'troubled', 'what', 'done', 'what', 'back', 'home', 'Williams', 'chilling', 'performance', 'what', 'amounts', 'supporting', 'role', 'film', 'film', 'was', 'adapted', 'script', 'written', 'Nikolaj', 'Frobenius', 'Erik', 'Skjoldbjaer', 'American', 'version', 'what', 'worked', 'so', 'well', 'original', '1997', 'film', 'also', 'Nolan', 'Pacino', 'bring', 'own', 'personalities', 'project.The', 'Blu-ray', 'transfer', 'exceptionally', 'good', 'nice', 'detail', 'depth', 'accurate', 'colors', 'are', 'minor', 'problems', 'edge', 'enhancement', 'ringing', 'crop', 'time', 'time', 'whole', 'extremely', 'satisfying', 'presentation', 'film.The', 'audio', 'stand', 'out', 'as', 'well', 'strong', '5.1', 'DTS', 'mix', 'long', 'silences', 'atmospheric', 'effects', 'dialogue', 'David', 'Julyan', 'outstanding', 'moody', 'score', 'benefit', 'presentation', 'are', 'also', 'subtitles', 'English', 'French', 'Spanish', 'Portuguese', 'French', 'Spanish', 'Portuguese', 'German.We', 'get', 'terrific', 'commentary', 'track', 'director', 'unusual', 'presentation', 'Blu-ray', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'particularly', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Nolan', 'work.We', 'also', 'get', 'scene', 'specific', 'commentary', 'Swank', 'writer', 'American', 'version', 'film', 'Hilary', 'Seitz', 'Wally', 'Pfister', 'who', 'film', 'film', 'editor', 'production', 'designer', 'unique', 'intersting', 'comments', 'nicely', 'compliment', 'film', 'scene', 'specific', 'commentary', 'runs', 'just', '45', 'minutes.We', 'also', 'get', 'four', 'featurettes', 'production', 'film', 'short', 'are', 'informative', 'are', 'presented', 'SD', 'are', 'ported', 'DVD', 'also', 'single', 'deleted', 'scene', 'stills', 'gallery', 'presented', 'HD', 'Insomnia', 'exceptional', 'thriller', 'strong', 'performances', 'Pacino', 'Williams', 'as', 'well', 'terrific', 'direction', 'Nolan.Highly', 'recommended']",Insomnia Region 2

As detective dormer he and his partner as many know go to Alaska where for the most part its very dark(during the six months of spring/summer) to go on a dark journey through lies and deception, and basically what is good and what is evil? Robin Williams does a stellar job as usual being the nasty perhaps psycho on the island, named Brody, a local book writer. When he is accused of killing a young admirer of his book, a young teen age girl, this start to spin out of control. Also as Al Pacino's partner gets gunned down there is also a very dark secret behind it as well. So most people have probably seen this film i can't really spoil it, but i will desist anyway. Its not really worth getting on Blu-Ray, i've had the original for many years and it suits me fine.

He often will not even say a word; the tension looms as a coil ready to spring.  Pacino generates interest, speaking or silent.In ""Insomnia"" Pacino plays a well known but highly troubled Los Angeles detective assigned with partner Marty Dawson to travel to a small Alaskan town to help solve a murder which has local police baffled.  When he arrives Pacino is overwhelmed when energetic rookie officer Hilary Swank, determined to be the best in her profession, idolizes him to the point of knowing his cases and even notable quotes, in the manner of a baseball fan knowing the statistics and famous games of a favorite player.Alaska is known for its seemingly interminable alternating periods of sun and darkness.  Pacino arrives during the sun period.  As a result, he finds it impossible to sleep.  As the story develops we learn that it is more than the sun, however, bothering Pacino.  His own past and present career as an officer reside in indefinite turmoil.Pacino is in Alaska to solve the murder of an attractive 17-year-old girl.  When suspicion shifts from her abrasive, physically abusive high school boyfriend to a local older pulp mystery writer, the story heats up.When Pacino and police cohorts are seeking to corner the murder suspect in a field shrouded in fog, Pacino unleashes a shot and kills his partner.  He is happy to leave the impression that the retreating suspect killed his Los Angeles police sidekick, but his world is jolted when, during one of his many sleepless nights, he receives a call from the detective writer, who reveals that he saw Pacino fire the shot that killed his partner.Robin Williams, who made his mark in rollicking comedy, turns in a superb effort as the troubled writer who believes that, by making a compact with Pacino, they can both emerge free of suspicion.  The wily but troubled Williams theorizes that all Pacino needs to do is direct suspicion back to the boyfriend, pretend to solve the case, and return to Los Angeles, leaving him unscathed with a patsy being convicted of the crime.  He explains that he did not really mean to kill the young woman anymore than Pacino meant to kill his partner.  Accordingly, they should both be free of any taint of guilt.The picture and the blackmail offer from Williams becomes more complicated when it is revealed that Pacino was being investigated by the internal affairs department in Los Angeles and believed his own partner would be a crucial element in bringing him down.  So did he or did he not kill his partner deliberately?  Does Pacino ultimately know?The imaginative script by Hilary Seitz keeps viewers guessing until its conclusion.  Swink, a recent Best Actress Oscar winner, does a superb job as the gung ho small town Alaska police officer who begins figuring things out on her own pertaining to both Pacino and Williams.",4,Pacino in Top Form,1037145600,"11 13, 2002",2002,3025,"['time', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'became', 'international', 'superstar', 'gripping', 'performance', 'Dog', 'Day', 'Afternoon', 'held', 'film', 'audiences', 'rapt', 'attention', 'inner', 'intensity', 'often', 'will', 'not', 'even', 'say', 'word', 'tension', 'coil', 'ready', 'spring', 'Pacino', 'interest', 'speaking', 'silent.In', 'Insomnia', 'Pacino', 'well', 'known', 'highly', 'troubled', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'detective', 'assigned', 'partner', 'Marty', 'Dawson', 'travel', 'small', 'Alaskan', 'town', 'help', 'solve', 'murder', 'local', 'police', 'baffled', 'When', 'Pacino', 'overwhelmed', 'when', 'energetic', 'rookie', 'officer', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'determined', 'be', 'best', 'profession', 'point', 'knowing', 'cases', 'even', 'notable', 'quotes', 'manner', 'baseball', 'fan', 'knowing', 'statistics', 'famous', 'games', 'favorite', 'player.Alaska', 'known', 'seemingly', 'interminable', 'alternating', 'periods', 'sun', 'darkness', 'Pacino', 'sun', 'period', 'result', 'impossible', 'sleep', 'story', 'learn', 'more', 'sun', 'however', 'bothering', 'Pacino', 'own', 'past', 'present', 'career', 'officer', 'reside', 'indefinite', 'turmoil.Pacino', 'Alaska', 'solve', 'murder', 'attractive', '17-year-old', 'girl', 'When', 'suspicion', 'shifts', 'abrasive', 'physically', 'abusive', 'high', 'school', 'boyfriend', 'local', 'older', 'pulp', 'mystery', 'writer', 'story', 'up.When', 'Pacino', 'police', 'cohorts', 'are', 'seeking', 'corner', 'murder', 'suspect', 'field', 'shrouded', 'fog', 'Pacino', 'shot', 'kills', 'partner', 'happy', 'leave', 'impression', 'retreating', 'suspect', 'killed', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'police', 'sidekick', 'world', 'jolted', 'when', 'one', 'many', 'sleepless', 'nights', 'call', 'detective', 'writer', 'who', 'saw', 'Pacino', 'fire', 'shot', 'killed', 'partner.Robin', 'Williams', 'who', 'made', 'mark', 'rollicking', 'comedy', 'superb', 'effort', 'troubled', 'writer', 'who', 'making', 'compact', 'Pacino', 'can', 'emerge', 'free', 'suspicion', 'wily', 'troubled', 'Williams', 'Pacino', 'needs', 'do', 'direct', 'suspicion', 'back', 'boyfriend', 'pretend', 'solve', 'case', 'return', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'leaving', 'unscathed', 'patsy', 'being', 'convicted', 'crime', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'mean', 'kill', 'young', 'woman', 'anymore', 'Pacino', 'meant', 'kill', 'partner', 'Accordingly', 'should', 'be', 'free', 'taint', 'guilt.The', 'picture', 'blackmail', 'offer', 'Williams', 'more', 'complicated', 'when', 'revealed', 'Pacino', 'was', 'being', 'investigated', 'internal', 'affairs', 'department', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'believed', 'own', 'partner', 'would', 'be', 'crucial', 'element', 'bringing', 'down', 'So', 'did', 'did', 'not', 'kill', 'partner', 'deliberately', 'Does', 'Pacino', 'ultimately', 'know', 'imaginative', 'script', 'Hilary', 'Seitz', 'viewers', 'guessing', 'conclusion', 'Swink', 'recent', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'superb', 'job', 'gung', 'ho', 'small', 'town', 'Alaska', 'police', 'officer', 'who', 'figuring', 'things', 'out', 'own', 'pertaining', 'Pacino', 'Williams']",Insomnia Region 2

709397,AP3B615GM191G,B00006AGHD,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 3]","I was originally drawn to this film because of director Christopher Nolan.  After viewing his Batman re-boots (Batman Begins & The Dark Knight) and enjoying them immensely, I was hopefully that Nolan's other works would provide some of the same.  In the case of Insomnia, he makes a much more ""traditional"" film, shrouded in a bit of false advertising to make it seem a bit more mysterious than it really is.For a basic plot summary, the film centers on policeman Will Dormer (Al Pacino), who travels to an Alaskan town to try and solve a murder case.  With an Internal Affairs investigation breathing down his neck back home, Dormer is under intense pressure to succeed in this new arena.  While teaming with local cop Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank), Dormer not only struggles to solve the case, but also gets mixed up with mysterious writer Walter Finch (Robin Williams).On the whole, this movie functions pretty well as a traditional cop drama.  It has the murder mystery, the gun shootouts, and the intrigue plotline which questions the integrity of pretty much everyone involved.  Without looking for anything more, this would be a very solid film.However, the film is advertised/promoted as so much more than just a cop drama.  The title itself indicates that the condition of insomnia will play a big role in the film, but it does not (Dormer not sleeping doesn't seem to add anything to the plot).  Robin Williams's role is billed as a taut, psychological thrill-ride, but he doesn't make an appearance until an hour into the movie and even after that point is severely underutilized.  Also, Swank's character is introduced as a potential key part in the film, but she (like Williams) just isn't given anything interesting to do.Thus, I can only give this film an ""average"" rating due to its inability to rise above a simple cop drama.",3,"Solid Cop Drama, But Not Spectacular",1278374400,"07 6, 2010",2010,1838,"['was', 'originally', 'drawn', 'film', 'director', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'viewing', 'Batman', 're-boots', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'enjoying', 'immensely', 'was', 'hopefully', 'Nolan', 'other', 'works', 'would', 'provide', 'same', 'case', 'Insomnia', 'much', 'more', 'traditional', 'film', 'shrouded', 'bit', 'false', 'advertising', 'make', 'seem', 'bit', 'more', 'mysterious', 'really', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'film', 'centers', 'policeman', 'Will', 'Dormer', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'who', 'Alaskan', 'town', 'try', 'solve', 'murder', 'case', 'Internal', 'Affairs', 'investigation', 'breathing', 'down', 'neck', 'back', 'home', 'Dormer', 'intense', 'pressure', 'succeed', 'new', 'arena', 'teaming', 'local', 'cop', 'Ellie', 'Burr', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'Dormer', 'not', 'only', 'solve', 'case', 'also', 'mixed', 'up', 'mysterious', 'writer', 'Walter', 'Finch', 'Robin', 'Williams', '.On', 'whole', 'movie', 'functions', 'pretty', 'well', 'traditional', 'cop', 'drama', 'murder', 'mystery', 'gun', 'shootouts', 'intrigue', 'plotline', 'questions', 'integrity', 'pretty', 'much', 'everyone', 'involved', 'looking', 'anything', 'more', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'solid', 'film.However', 'film', 'advertised/promoted', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'cop', 'drama', 'title', 'condition', 'insomnia', 'will', 'play', 'big', 'role', 'film', 'not', 'Dormer', 'not', 'sleeping', ""n't"", 'seem', 'add', 'anything', 'plot', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'role', 'billed', 'taut', 'psychological', 'thrill-ride', ""n't"", 'make', 'appearance', 'hour', 'movie', 'even', 'point', 'severely', 'underutilized', 'Also', 'Swank', 'character', 'introduced', 'potential', 'key', 'part', 'film', 'Williams', 'just', ""n't"", 'given', 'anything', 'interesting', 'do.Thus', 'can', 'only', 'give', 'film', 'average', 'rating', 'due', 'inability', 'rise', 'simple', 'cop', 'drama']",Insomnia Region 2

Al Pacino and Robin Williams deliver very captivating performances in this film, so it's no wonder why this film did so well.

By the first 20 minutes, ""INSOMNIA"" was already creeping up my Top Ten List. I had never been so intrigued by such a diverse and complex plot before. The great thing is that the movie is entirely fixed on Will Dormer(Al Pacino), who is an L.A. detective brought to Nightmute, Alaska,a place where the sun never goes down, to study a murder case. You are never a step ahead or behind him. You find all the clues he finds at the same time he does. You also sometimes even know what he is thinking, this happens when the film flashbacks to earlier scenes in the movie or scenes beyond the movie.Pacino does an excellent job with his character and he developes it so well I almost believed I could meet Will Dormer. And as the film progesses you have more insight on his emotions even more because of the lack of sleep. Also you even develope sympathy for Finch(Robin Williams), the murderer who Will is investigating on.The only thing else I can say is don't wait for it on DVD, see it in the theater, it's much better that way, but if you don't take my advice, it would still be worth the wait.",5,SUPERB!
