815976,A39CX0EE4BZCZC,B0001XAMH2,Craig Connell,"[1, 1]","If you love the blues, you will love this DVD: plain and simple. It features one of the all-time greats and a lot of his music, all done by him.This has more of a concert feel to it than a documentary. It does span three decades of John Lee Hooker's singing career, so you get both Hooker seen in many concerts and you also get many famous singers talking about him. You see some black-and-white footage of him way back in 1960 at the Newport Jazz Festival, through other TV and concert performances, all the way to the 1990s. Mostly, you hear him sing, and that's why I got this DVD.""The Boogie Man,"" as John Lee refers to himself here, had a unique sound of his own and he knew it. He isn't that modest about where he stands among blues greats, but who can argue? Not me, because I enjoyed every song in here. The nine-minute ""Boogie"" number he does with Foghat and Paul Butterfield ALONE is worth the price of this DVD. It had me tears just watching and listening to it. It's just an unbelievable number.As Bonnie Raitt comments here, whether Hooker performed alone with just his guitar, or with a band and an electric guitar, ""he was the real deal."" On this disc, you can watch Hooker and a dozen other big-named musicians, all of them good and all of them big fans of this blues legend. Even some not-so-big names help out with some nice instrumentation. I don't know who the piano player was on ""Boom, Boom, Boom,"" since he isn't listed, but he was fantastic.As mentioned, this DVD is a lot more music than documentary and that's fine with me. I just want to hear this guy sing and play. It's blues at its best.",5,Bluesman John Lee Hooker: The 'Real Deal',1188950400,"09 5, 2007",2007,1617,"['love', 'blues', 'will', 'love', 'DVD', 'plain', 'simple', 'one', 'all-time', 'greats', 'lot', 'music', 'done', 'him.This', 'more', 'concert', 'feel', 'documentary', 'span', 'three', 'decades', 'John', 'Lee', 'Hooker', 'singing', 'career', 'get', 'Hooker', 'seen', 'many', 'concerts', 'also', 'get', 'many', 'famous', 'singers', 'talking', 'see', 'black-and-white', 'footage', 'way', 'back', '1960', 'Newport', 'Jazz', 'Festival', 'other', 'TV', 'concert', 'performances', 'way', '1990s', 'Mostly', 'hear', 'sing', 'why', 'got', 'DVD', 'Boogie', 'Man', 'John', 'Lee', 'refers', 'here', 'had', 'unique', 'sound', 'own', 'knew', ""n't"", 'modest', 'where', 'blues', 'greats', 'who', 'can', 'argue', 'Not', 'enjoyed', 'song', 'here', 'nine-minute', 'Boogie', 'number', 'Foghat', 'Paul', 'Butterfield', 'ALONE', 'price', 'DVD', 'had', 'just', 'watching', 'listening', 'just', 'unbelievable', 'number.As', 'Bonnie', 'Raitt', 'comments', 'here', 'Hooker', 'performed', 'alone', 'just', 'guitar', 'band', 'electric', 'guitar', 'was', 'real', 'deal', 'disc', 'can', 'watch', 'Hooker', 'dozen', 'other', 'big-named', 'musicians', 'good', 'big', 'fans', 'blues', 'legend', 'Even', 'not-so-big', 'names', 'help', 'out', 'nice', 'instrumentation', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'piano', 'player', 'was', 'Boom', 'Boom', 'Boom', ""n't"", 'listed', 'was', 'fantastic.As', 'mentioned', 'DVD', 'lot', 'more', 'music', 'documentary', 'fine', 'just', 'want', 'hear', 'guy', 'sing', 'play', 'blues', 'best']",N/A

There are some real Gem's here, and the sound quality is very good for as old as some of these recordings are. This is a real Blues Man playing and singing REAL blues. I have a number of his CD's, including his ""Gold Collection"" CD (Gold CD's) that sounds great! I'll definitely get more of his DVD's in the days to come. (I know he's gone now) This one's a great start due to the sound quality, I'm sure it's been remastered though. The video is mostly very good also, some in B&W; and some in color but overall very decent. I really enjoyed watching this bit of history.I wish Amazon had a 3 criteria rating that would make for a quicker, more accurate and fair rating of Cd's, DVD's and Blu-ray's.1. Performance2. Quality of Audio3. Quality of Video (for DVD's and Blu-ray's)1.****2.*****3.****Artists that wish to have there performances recorded and recognized should be held to a standard. Poor Audio or Video, no matter how good the performance, is still a bad product. Those who would still purchase sub-standard Audio or Video quality recordings and rank that product highly just because of performance are not doing the industry or the band justice.

815979,A12S5XTMAHYYME,B0001XAMH2,Perry Celestino,"[32, 32]","John Lee Hooker was the last of the unstructured real country Bluesmen. He was a semi-urbanized Robert Johnson-style one man band and was even born in Clarksdale, Mississippi where WC Handy had first seen slide guitar playing. I can remember seeing John Lee in Central Park in 1967 playing second fiddle to Al Kooper and the final stages of the Blues Project. He came out all alone, no band, just a chair and blew them totally away. You can't beat the real thing! This DVD is a definite must have for any Blues fan. As the ranks of real Blues originals diminishes we need to cling on to these type of records. This compilation is well edited and put together. It is over two hours long which is what Blues fans want.The songs are a great overview of JLH's career including  his classic Newport Jazz Festival appearance and his famous 1965 European American Folk Blues Festival version of &quot;Hobo Blues&quot;. Also included is a track from his excellent 1980s &quot;Maintenance Shop Blues&quot; appearance (I wish they would re-release the Albert King Set!).All in all this is a wonderful compilation. It shows Hooker in all stages of his playing; by himself, with various guest artists, with bands and of course with Santana doing &quot;The Healer&quot;. I would also strongly recommend the two JLH DVD's from Vestapol: &quot;John Lee Hooker and Friends&quot; and &quot;John Lee Hooker:Rare Performances&quot;(Amazon can get these by Special Order).
