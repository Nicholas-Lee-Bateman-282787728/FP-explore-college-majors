614394,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00005JM5Q,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[7, 9]","Ella is not your ordinary hero.  Since birth, when she was presented with the gift of obedience, Ella has been forced to obey anyone that commanded her.  From the smallest tasks to even the worst deeds known to man, she has had no choice but to obey whole-heartedly.  This has been her way of life until she meets a boy.  Not just any boy, but the soon-to-be King, Prince Char.  Char is adored by all in his kingdom, but finds a light in Ella that he has not seen before.  After she is forced to leave her best friend behind after some thievery, Ella makes a choice to rid herself of this curse once and for all by asking the fairy that gave it to her to remove it.  This is not an easy task.  As she ventures into the world outside the castle, Ella (accompanied by Char) begins to fall in love and is shown the truth of the Kingdom by an elf, giant, and a troll.  Together this band of misfit characters must help stop an assassination attempt on the Prince Char by his diabolical Uncle Edgar and his troubled snake.  Will Ella be able to control her curse, or will she just be another pawn in Edgar's master plan?My answer, ""Who cares!""  To be as simple as possible, this film was boring.  In a world where films pride themselves on being imaginative, Ella Enchanted goes in the opposite direction and sticks to a prefabricated structure and story.  Everything witnessed in this film can be seen from any other film of this genre.  There was no stepping out of the box for director Tommy O'Haver.  Hathaway gives the worst performances of her short career as Ella, who attempts to hard to be cute and bubbly instead of the troubled character that she is.  Even Elwes gives his normal performance as the over-the-top Uncle Edgar.  Nobody moved outside of their imagination box.  This film had the potential to be a decent story, but instead of actually building a fresh story, O'Haver spent his money on cliched Matrix-esque movements and unfunny sight gags that seemed to plaque this film around every corner.  The sets were obvious and the effects were sub-par at best.  I never felt as if I was transformed into the world where Ella lived, but instead was continually reminded that this was nothing short of a boring movie.The only last comment I have about this film was the apparent lack of characters.  From the opening scenes, I felt that Ella's best friend was going to have a pivotal role in this film, when instead she was dropped and then forgotten about until the last minute.  Here is another example of an unused character.  What was the point of the snake?  What target audience was O'Haver trying to appeal to with this poorly computer-graphically created animal?  I never saw the purpose for this creature.  Finally, Minnie Driver's character was the worst.  It was as if she was just used to attract another target audience ... same as Vivica Fox.  If you have these characters, use them ... do not just let them sit around ... get them moving!Overall, this was an unmotivated movie that failed on every level.  No child should be exposed to such poor acting, bad filmmaking, and an overplayed story.  Please, do your child a favor and have them pick up a book and read these fairy tales instead of forcing them to watch boring movies attempts like Ella Enchanted.  Your children will thank you in the long run.Grade:  * out of ****",1,Ella of Frell you're not like other girls.,1094947200,"09 12, 2004",2004,3351,"['Ella', 'not', 'ordinary', 'hero', 'birth', 'when', 'was', 'presented', 'gift', 'obedience', 'Ella', 'been', 'forced', 'obey', 'anyone', 'commanded', 'smallest', 'tasks', 'even', 'worst', 'deeds', 'known', 'man', 'had', 'choice', 'obey', 'whole-heartedly', 'been', 'way', 'life', 'boy', 'Not', 'just', 'boy', 'soon-to-be', 'King', 'Prince', 'Char', 'Char', 'adored', 'kingdom', 'light', 'Ella', 'not', 'seen', 'forced', 'leave', 'best', 'friend', 'behind', 'thievery', 'Ella', 'choice', 'rid', 'herself', 'curse', 'once', 'asking', 'fairy', 'gave', 'remove', 'not', 'easy', 'task', 'ventures', 'world', 'castle', 'Ella', 'accompanied', 'Char', 'fall', 'love', 'shown', 'truth', 'Kingdom', 'elf', 'giant', 'troll', 'Together', 'band', 'misfit', 'characters', 'must', 'help', 'stop', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'Prince', 'Char', 'diabolical', 'Uncle', 'Edgar', 'troubled', 'snake', 'Will', 'Ella', 'be', 'able', 'control', 'curse', 'will', 'just', 'be', 'pawn', 'Edgar', 'master', 'plan', 'answer', 'Who', 'be', 'as', 'simple', 'possible', 'film', 'was', 'boring', 'world', 'where', 'films', 'pride', 'being', 'imaginative', 'Ella', 'Enchanted', 'opposite', 'direction', 'sticks', 'prefabricated', 'structure', 'story', 'Everything', 'witnessed', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'other', 'film', 'genre', 'was', 'stepping', 'box', 'director', 'Tommy', ""O'Haver"", 'Hathaway', 'worst', 'performances', 'short', 'career', 'Ella', 'who', 'hard', 'be', 'cute', 'bubbly', 'instead', 'troubled', 'character', 'Even', 'Elwes', 'normal', 'performance', 'over-the-top', 'Uncle', 'Edgar', 'Nobody', 'moved', 'outside', 'imagination', 'box', 'film', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'decent', 'story', 'instead', 'actually', 'building', 'fresh', 'story', ""O'Haver"", 'spent', 'money', 'cliched', 'Matrix-esque', 'movements', 'unfunny', 'sight', 'gags', 'seemed', 'plaque', 'film', 'corner', 'sets', 'were', 'obvious', 'effects', 'were', 'sub-par', 'best', 'never', 'felt', 'was', 'transformed', 'world', 'where', 'Ella', 'lived', 'instead', 'was', 'continually', 'reminded', 'was', 'nothing', 'short', 'boring', 'movie.The', 'only', 'last', 'comment', 'have', 'film', 'was', 'apparent', 'lack', 'characters', 'opening', 'scenes', 'felt', 'Ella', 'best', 'friend', 'was', 'going', 'have', 'pivotal', 'role', 'film', 'when', 'instead', 'was', 'dropped', 'then', 'forgotten', 'last', 'minute', 'Here', 'example', 'unused', 'character', 'What', 'was', 'point', 'snake', 'What', 'target', 'audience', 'was', ""O'Haver"", 'trying', 'appeal', 'poorly', 'computer-graphically', 'created', 'animal', 'never', 'saw', 'purpose', 'creature', 'Finally', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'character', 'was', 'worst', 'was', 'was', 'just', 'used', 'attract', 'target', 'audience', 'same', 'Vivica', 'Fox', 'have', 'characters', 'use', 'do', 'not', 'just', 'let', 'sit', 'around', 'get', 'moving', 'Overall', 'was', 'unmotivated', 'movie', 'failed', 'level', 'child', 'should', 'be', 'exposed', 'such', 'poor', 'acting', 'bad', 'filmmaking', 'overplayed', 'story', 'Please', 'do', 'child', 'favor', 'have', 'pick', 'up', 'book', 'read', 'fairy', 'tales', 'instead', 'forcing', 'watch', 'boring', 'movies', 'attempts', 'Ella', 'Enchanted', 'children', 'will', 'thank', 'long', 'run.Grade', '*', '****']",N/A

Downes ""downfall4""","[3, 7]","I watched this movie with familymembers over New Year's and I have to say, I was almost embarrassed that we had selected it as a rental.  My daughter is 8, and even she didn't like it very much. It is way too anachronistic for one thing.  The wooden escalator wasn't too bad, but the last scene with their version of Elton John's ""Don't Go Breaking My Heart"" about killed me and the other adult viewer. It could go down as one of the campiest moments in recent girl flicks. The song wouldn't even appeal much to young girls (the target audience, am I right or not?) It was hideously ridiculous.  If Anne Hathaway was singing, she does have a sweet voice, but the prince had a very weak voice if he indeed was singing.  The ogres needed a better make up job.  Minnie Driver seemed to have not more than a cameo role.  The whole ""dad thing"" was really confusing.  Unlike a true Cinderella story where the poor father is dead, in this story he seemed to be off peddling watches, and couldn't help his poor daughter stuck at home with a wicked (of course) stepmother and her two daughters.  I don't want to confuse this movie with ""A Cinderella Story"" with Hilary Duff which is surprisingly very enjoyable and far more believable than this Cinderella story.  If you're an adult and you want a headache, watch this movie to the last campy moment.  Let's see how you feel after that. Did Elton John give permission for his song to be used in this way?  Anne Hathaway is very sweet, but she really needs to move on, or she'll be relegated to the toddler viewers.

It was a great book, and I had high hopes for the movie, especially since Anne Hathaway, who stars as Ella, was spectacular in The Princess Diaries. However, the movie didn't live up to my expectations. The plot was changed around a lot - Prince Char now has an evil uncle; Ella is no longer a talented linguist, but a magical-creatures'-rights activist; Slannen the elf is not a potter, but a lawyer; and Ella's magical book is her fairy cook, Mandy's boyfriend. I thought the movie was well-cast, with Hathaway as Ella, and Parminder Nagra of Bend it Like Beckham as Ella's best friend Areida, but I think the script should have tried to stick to the book more. I also got pretty tired of the Dr. Seuss-esque narrator who showed up every now and then. And the little ""Don't Go Breaking my Heart"" dance didn't seem to go with the plot of the story at all.

This movie is like Shrek meets The Princess Bride meets Cinderella. It's so funny and sweet-- just an all around great time! And it's about ten times better than those screwy teen comedies that have no depth or range. I'm shocked this movie did poorly at the boxoffice because it deserved everyone's attention!Every child is given a gift at birth. Ella is given the gift of obedience by a haphazard fairy named Lucinda (Vivica A. Fox), who says that Ella will now be the perfect child.

614416,A3IY28PW12MSVN,B00005JM5Q,Christine Wong,"[5, 5]","""Ella Enchanted"" is an entertaining family film, and a delightful way to spend an evening.  It is admittedly aimed toward a younger audience, but I think children and their parents will like it.  The writing is often rather witty; the setting is stylistically without feeling plastic-y; and the characters are daffy and likable.Here's the basic premise: Ella of Frell was given the ""gift"" (haha) of obedience by the fairy Lucinda.  Ella must do exactly as she is told, all the time.  As she grows older, her gift (curse, really) poses problems when her widowed father remarries a snotty, stuck-up woman.  The woman has two stepdaughters who uncover Ella's secret gift and use it against her.  Ella finally decides to go out to find Lucinda and make her take back her gift.  Along the way, she campaigns for the rights of ogres, giants, and elves, and falls in love with a handsome prince.A plot like that leaves a lot of room for adaptation to the big screen.  Now, I haven't read the book (so I can't say if the movie ""lives up"" to the book) but I will say that the screenwriters did a great job.  The script is often funny and witty.  (One of the funniest scenes is when Ella is in the giants' bar and reacting to their orders of ""sing"", ""put some soul into it,"" and ""dance""...you don't want to miss this scene!)  I also thought the pacing was excellent; I never felt bored and the movie lasted just the right amount of time.  The look of this movie is also delightful, refreshing and easy on the eyes.  Although everything is fairytale-like, from the buildings to the costumes, there is a sense of modernity that adds quirky style to the story.Despite the good writing and style, a movie like this can't succeed if we don't like the heroine, Ella.  Well, the movie does succeed wonderfully because Anne Hathaway, who plays Ella, is likable, intelligent, charming, and beautiful.  She is luminous with a big, funny smile.  Hathaway's sweetness is one of the reasons why we are so entertained by the movie.  (For example, a Hilary Duff version of Ella would be disastrous because Duff can only play somewhat unlikable, ditzy, verbally-challenged characters.)Another reason this movie is successful is its wealth of supporting characters.  Prince Charmont (Hugh Dancy) is handsome, sweet, and also very likable.  Dancy's chemistry with Hathaway is quite something to behold; these are two people so likable and sweet that we want very much for them to be together.  Also adding to the daffiness of the plot are Slannen the Elf (Aiden McArdle), Benny the Talking Book (Jimi Mistry), the evil Prince Edgar (Cary Elwes), his talking snake Heston, the household fairy Mandy (Minnie Driver), and Ella's two stepsisters Hattie and Olive.  Although Hathaway is the clear star of the movie, the supporting characters add a real emotional depth to the story.Music is also a pretty big part of this movie and it works to a large extent, jazzing the movie up and inspiring the characters.  To be more specific, there are two great musical numbers, and both are very memorable.  ""Ella Enchanted"" is a great family movie, and definitely worth a watch.

614422,A169I83JL8QJGN,B00005JM5Q,Daniel A Moir,"[6, 13]","A mess. I have found out that this film was apparently based on a novel, I would recommend without reading it to stick with the novel. Seeing this movie was my wife's idea, and I was reluctant simply because I had heard nothing about this movie (good or bad) and didn't know what it was. I wanted to see Hellboy, now I wish I had, even if it meant letting my wife trod off to see this disaster by herself.It seems that the idea behind the movie was to parody fairy tales, offering a sort of ""Cinderella with a twist"" sort of tale. Many elements of the parody seem ripped from the drastically better ""Shrek"" including the oppression of mystical creatures, elves, Ogres, etc seemed very reminiscent of Lord Farquad's activities in the first Shrek. The big difference between Ella Enchanted and Shrek is that Ella Enchanted is not really funny. I found myself rolling my eyes, smacking my forehead, and playing Mystery Science Theater despite my wife's slugging me very hard in the arm. Sadly the only laughs this movie garnered from the audience were when I did my Simon Cowell impersonation and commented on Ann Hathaway's song and dance routine. This movie wants to be Shrek, meets Cinderella, meets A Knights Tale, but lacks the humor and subtlety of Shrek, the intrigue of a good Cinderella (al la Ever After) and the charm of A Knights Tale. In short, this is the worst interpretation of Cinderella I have ever seen. I cannot comment on the book from which this movie draws its inspiration, but I can say that this film certainly offers little incentive to actually read it. My wife liked it, but mentioned its not a buy worthy movie. I would think that the only audience who might like to buy this film (Pardon my generalizing)would be 13-year-old girls (probably the film's target audience). The film contains a hunky guy whose perfect in every way, IQ-taxing humor, and poor special effects along side a cheesy stereotypical ""Cinderella"" romance story that only a 13-14 year old girl (or younger) could enjoy. The film contains nothing for older audiences, and nothing for well... guys... And that's okay, there's plenty of guy movies out there (like Hellboy). The rest of us would have to fight the urge to Play Mystery Science Theater and mock this film. An urge I could not resist.

614423,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00005JM5Q,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[3, 3]","There's a reason that every year seems to bring at least one new adaptation of the Cinderella story - it is, indeed, an enchanting story that speaks to the heart.  Who doesn't love Cinderella?  I oftentimes find myself pulling for the bad guys in films, but who in the world could ever like that evil step-mother or her awful daughters?  Of course, Ella Enchanted isn't your traditional fairy tale, even though all of the important elements are there - the fairy godmother, the prince, etc.  Ella is not reduced to slavery by her step-mother, and she doesn't have any contact with cinders, but she does find herself effectively controlled by one of her awful new step-sisters.  Anyone who has read Terry Pratchett or watched Shrek 2 knows that fairy godmothers do more harm than good, and the one in this movie (played by Vivica A. Fox) proves the point.  Lucinda's gift to the baby Ella is obedience.  You may think you've gotten some rotten gifts before, but the gift of obedience is the worst of the worst.  Ella grows up with a strong mind and a beautiful heart, but she is helpless to refuse any request made of her.  You can just imagine the kind of havoc one could wreak if one found out Ella's secret.  Forbidden to tell anyone about her curse of a blessing, Ella eventually decides that she must seek out her godmother and beg her to take the gift back.Ella sets out on her long journey in the days preceding the coronation of Prince Char (Hugh Dancy).  Char is pretty much the Elvis of the realm, with young ladies in waiting breaking out into hysterics whenever he appears and, more often than not, chasing him down like hounds after a fox.  He first meets Ella during one such chase, and he is immediately taken by this young lady who doesn't swoon in his presence; in fact, Ella has a thing or two to say to the young prince because she is opposed to his uncle's royal policies that discriminate against ogres, elves, and giants.  She knows what it is like to have to do something against your wishes, and that makes her most forthright in her political statements.  As fate would have it, the two meet again, love blossoms, and the prince gets to see firsthand the unfortunate lives his non-human subjects have been forced into living.  Eventually, they arrive at the castle, and fate's dark side decides to show up and torture the innocent Ella once again.  The prospects go far beyond the ruin of her love life, however; they threaten the integrity and welfare of the entire kingdom.Ella Enchanted is a somewhat unusual film.  I daresay it's the only place you'll ever find ""Cinderella"" belting out a saucy version of Queen's Somebody to Love, for instance.  It's a little jarring to hear Strange Magic as the film opens, but you quickly grow to love the entire soundtrack (especially if you're an adult - most kids won't recognize some of the classic tunes included here).  I can't say the special effects are all that great, especially the ones featuring giants, but it is the story, not the special effects, which matter in this particular case, and Ella Enchanted really delivers story-wise.  With its mix of humor and drama, it should appeal to most any viewer - and you can't help but be won over by the beauty and talent of Anne Hathaway in the lead role.Ella Enchanted succeeds admirably in delivering a new twist on a universally known story of good vs. evil.  I wouldn't rank it up there with Ever After, but it's definitely one of the better Cinderella adaptations I've seen.",5,A delightful new twist on a well-known fairy tale,1143331200,"03 26, 2006",2006,3502,"['reason', 'year', 'bring', 'least', 'one', 'new', 'adaptation', 'Cinderella', 'story', 'indeed', 'enchanting', 'story', 'heart', 'Who', ""n't"", 'love', 'Cinderella', 'oftentimes', 'find', 'pulling', 'bad', 'guys', 'films', 'who', 'world', 'could', 'ever', 'evil', 'step-mother', 'awful', 'daughters', 'course', 'Ella', 'Enchanted', ""n't"", 'traditional', 'fairy', 'tale', 'even', 'important', 'elements', 'are', 'there', 'fairy', 'godmother', 'prince', 'etc', 'Ella', 'not', 'reduced', 'slavery', 'step-mother', ""n't"", 'have', 'contact', 'cinders', 'find', 'effectively', 'controlled', 'one', 'awful', 'new', 'step-sisters', 'Anyone', 'who', 'read', 'Terry', 'Pratchett', 'watched', 'Shrek', '2', 'fairy', 'godmothers', 'do', 'more', 'harm', 'good', 'one', 'movie', 'played', 'Vivica', 'A', 'Fox', 'point', 'Lucinda', 'gift', 'baby', 'Ella', 'obedience', 'may', 'think', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'rotten', 'gifts', 'gift', 'obedience', 'worst', 'worst', 'Ella', 'up', 'strong', 'mind', 'beautiful', 'heart', 'helpless', 'refuse', 'request', 'made', 'can', 'just', 'imagine', 'kind', 'havoc', 'one', 'could', 'wreak', 'one', 'found', 'Ella', 'secret', 'Forbidden', 'tell', 'anyone', 'curse', 'blessing', 'Ella', 'eventually', 'must', 'seek', 'out', 'godmother', 'beg', 'take', 'gift', 'back.Ella', 'out', 'long', 'journey', 'days', 'preceding', 'coronation', 'Prince', 'Char', 'Hugh', 'Dancy', 'Char', 'pretty', 'much', 'Elvis', 'realm', 'young', 'ladies', 'waiting', 'breaking', 'out', 'hysterics', 'whenever', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'chasing', 'down', 'hounds', 'fox', 'first', 'Ella', 'one', 'such', 'chase', 'immediately', 'taken', 'young', 'lady', 'who', ""n't"", 'swoon', 'presence', 'fact', 'Ella', 'thing', 'two', 'say', 'young', 'prince', 'opposed', 'uncle', 'royal', 'policies', 'discriminate', 'ogres', 'elves', 'giants', 'what', 'have', 'do', 'something', 'wishes', 'most', 'forthright', 'political', 'statements', 'fate', 'would', 'have', 'two', 'meet', 'again', 'love', 'blossoms', 'prince', 'see', 'firsthand', 'unfortunate', 'non-human', 'subjects', 'have', 'been', 'forced', 'living', 'Eventually', 'arrive', 'castle', 'fate', 'dark', 'side', 'show', 'up', 'torture', 'innocent', 'Ella', 'once', 'again', 'prospects', 'go', 'far', 'ruin', 'love', 'life', 'however', 'threaten', 'integrity', 'welfare', 'entire', 'kingdom.Ella', 'Enchanted', 'somewhat', 'unusual', 'film', 'daresay', 'only', 'place', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'find', 'Cinderella', 'belting', 'out', 'saucy', 'version', 'Queen', 'Somebody', 'Love', 'instance', 'little', 'jarring', 'hear', 'Strange', 'Magic', 'film', 'quickly', 'grow', 'love', 'entire', 'soundtrack', 'especially', ""'re"", 'adult', 'most', 'kids', 'wo', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'classic', 'tunes', 'included', 'here', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'great', 'especially', 'ones', 'featuring', 'giants', 'story', 'not', 'special', 'effects', 'matter', 'particular', 'case', 'Ella', 'Enchanted', 'really', 'story-wise', 'mix', 'humor', 'drama', 'should', 'appeal', 'most', 'viewer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'won', 'beauty', 'talent', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'lead', 'role.Ella', 'Enchanted', 'admirably', 'delivering', 'new', 'twist', 'universally', 'known', 'story', 'good', 'vs.', 'evil', 'would', ""n't"", 'rank', 'up', 'there', 'Ever', 'definitely', 'one', 'better', 'Cinderella', 'adaptations', ""'ve"", 'seen']",N/A

614432,A2VZP50FSYD6CO,B00005JM5Q,drebbles,"[2, 4]","In this take on the Cinderella story, as a baby, Ella of Frell was given the ""gift"" of obedience by a fairy. This causes all kinds of complications, as Ella must literally do what she is told, so if someone tells her to hold her tongue, she grabs it and holds it. Things get worse when her father marries and his new wife and daughters discover that Ella has to do whatever they tell her to do. When her stepsister, Hattie, forces her to shoplift, Ella is desperate to get help, and, armed with a talking book, she sets out to find Lucinda, the fairy that gave her this ""gift"". Along the way, Ella meets Prince Charmont (Char) and the two fall in love. This causes all kinds of complications, as Char is about to become King, but his uncle, Prince Edward, who unbeknownst to Char, killed Char's father, and will do anything he can to stop Char from becoming King. When he discovers Ella has to do whatever he says, he decides to use her to help him kill Char. Ella needs to find out how to lose the gift of obedience before it's too late.This was a silly, goofy little movie and I loved every minute of it! It effortlessly mixes elements of classic fairy tales - fairies, giants, elves, ogres, and enchanted books - with modern touches such as a shopping mall with wooden staircases that move like escalators and modern song and dance routines. There are a lot of clever touches; one of my favorites is when Hattie has Ella shoplift glass slippers. Ella is a strong heroine even with the gift of obedience. She knows what is right and wrong and isn't afraid to speak out about it, telling Char he needs to tell his uncle to stop mistreating the elves, ogres, and giants.The actors in this movie seem to be having a lot of fun with their parts. Anne Hathaway is perfect as Ella, very spirited and with a smile that can light up a room; Hugh Dancy is a handsome Prince Char; Cary Elwes is comically evil as Char's uncle.

At times she would over-eat, give away prized possessions, and much much more, all because of the stupid curse.

Soon the two of them have met another companion for their trip, Prince Charmont (Hugh Dancy), whom Ella takes a quick liking to. Along the way, the three of them come in contact with ogres, giants, and even Prince Charmont's evil Uncle Edgar (Cary Elwes), who plans on becoming King once Prince Charmont is out of the picture.As someone who read the book ELLA ENCHANTED by Gail Carson Levine, I was skeptical at whether the book would stay true to the movie. However, I quickly realized that I had nothing to worry about, for the film version, while not exactly the same as the novel, was quite similar, and enchanting in it's own right. Anne Hathaway (THE PRINCESS DIARIES and THE PRINCESS DIARIES 2: ROYAL ENGAGEMENT) proves her acting skills once again in the part of Ella, and shows movie fans her vocal talents in the many singing numbers she takes part in; while Hugh Dancy (KING ARTHUR and BLACK HAWK DOWN) couldn't be better in the part of Prince Charmont. He is everything you would expect a Prince to be, charming, handsome, and kind. Together Dancy and Hathaway create an award-winning performance filled with marvelous chemistry, and enchanting singing and dance numbers. Starring a fabulous crew of supporting actors, and featuring guest-appearances by Hollywood stars such as model Heidi Klum, ELLA ENCHANTED truly proves that it is just that...enchanting.

I was completely wrong. ""Ella Enchanted"" has a great story and a great cast. The only thing this film fails to do is be funny, and it appears to try. The story is a mixture of popular fairytales. When Ella(Anne Hathaway) was born, her nutty fairy godmother(Vivica A. Fox) bestowed upon the baby the gift of obedience(Sleeping Beauty). The spell causes Ella to do everything she is told, and she can't stop it from happening. Her father marries a mean woman who comes with excess baggage, two wicked daughters(Cinderella). So Ella grows up miserable because of her curse and her step sisters. When she gets fed up with the curse, she sets out to find her fairy godmother and get her to take back the spell. On the way, she joins up with an elf who wants to be a lawyer and a Prince who is about to take the throne. Naturally, the Prince and Ella fall in love, but the plot thickens as the Prince's evil uncle has plans to stay king. The story really blew me away, seeing as I hadn't read the book. This movie also has some cool modernized enviornments in Ella's world, including a wooden escalator. The modernization reminded me of ""The Flintstones,"" how the stone age had all of the modern conveniences. The acting was great and you even get to hear Anne Hathaway sing(and she is good!).I must warn parents that this film has a PG rating due to a dark twist in the plot. No matter how much they beg you, this film is not sutible for children under the age of 8. However, I leave that to your judgement. There is no foul language and the fighting in the film is very tame, mostly done with cool special effects. Also, there is an oger in the film with a plumber [but] that parents might not want their kids to see, I personally didn't find it offensive. ""Ella nchanted"" is a great film to take your family to, but leave the really little ones with a sitter.

If you're not a reader, which is unfortunate, you might think this spin by Disney is wonderful, but the FACT is, it REALLY doesn't hold any water, and it's filled with sarcasm, 70's music which doesn't have any bearing in the original tale, and a revisionist history which is totally out of whack with the history of the book, plus some bathroom humor added in which is certainly out of context.If you're looking for a real Cinderella story, try ""Ever After"" with Drew Barrymore.

614446,A2BJ9I0BQ1LH5S,B00005JM5Q,guitarchick24,"[10, 12]","... otherwise you will be sorely disappointed.Ella Enchanted (the book) is one of my favorite novels, ever.  Gail Carson Levine is a talented author who can craft great female characters in moving children's stories.The movie, unfortunately, feels like a sell-out.In an interview related to the release of this movie, Levine stated that she allowed the movie producers/directors to have a lot of liberty with the story.  The only thing she wanted kept was that Ella be obedient.  From the book, that is the only aspect that is kept.Ella Enchanted follows Anne Hathaway in the title role as she grows up dealing with a fairy's ""blessing"" - the gift of obedience.  This ""gift"" means that she must instantly obey whatever command is thrown at her, be it a true order or an off-hand comment.  From looking silly (""admit you're stupid"") to something more sinister, Ella is in constant danger - plus, it's a rather annoying trait to have.  On the road to finding her fairy godmother and hoping for the curse to be removed, she meets the prince of the land, saves him from a royal conspiracy, and gets a happy ending in the bargain.While the book is intended for a middle school audience, the movie feels like it's for children younger than that.  Ella of the book is sassy, and fights the curse in any way she can by either delaying her obedience or finding a clever way of carrying out someone's orders while denying the true spirit of their command.  Anne Hathaway's Ella is little more than a puppet, even acting like one whenever she carries out someone's order.  There's little spirit in her character and you have to wonder how she's even able to carry out her quest.  If she won't fight back in her day-to-day life, how can she fight back when the entire kingdom is at stake?The movie also takes some liberty with the world of Ella Enchanted that Levine so carefully crafts in her books.  There's other languages, other races, other species.  Unfortunately, one of the other species (the elves) are reduced to a comical sidekick kind of role, instead of the stately part they play in the original story. One of Ella's greatest talents is learning other languages, which doesn't even come into play in the movie.  And the movie assumes some things which, if you've never read the book before, just don't make sense.  (In particular, the scene where Ella is forced to tell her friend Arieda they must end their friendship because she could never be friends with an Ayorthaian.  Since the movie never sets up the prejudice against Ayorthaians found in the book, the scene doesn't make sense.  For all we know, Ella Enchanted the movie could be set in Ayortha!)The characters are very one-dimensional and obvious.  While the stepmother and stepsister are very sterotypical in the book, the protagonists (Ella, Mandy the fairy and Prince Char) have depth to them.  Mandy in particular is a no-nonsense, practical mentor and second mother to Ella.  But in the movie, Minnie Driver as Mandy the fairy is reduced to comic relief, as she can't even get her magic to work right.I suppose as family entertainment the movie is decent.  But I think the producers of this movie had a chance to make a quality children's film and instead chose to make a glitzy, stylized piece of fluff.  The book is powerful, moving, and has some great lessons on rising above adversity, selflessness, and finding your place in the world.  The movie has none of that except for a few hours of mindless drivel.  Do yourself a favor and either read the novel with your children or buy it for them.  They'll get a lot more out of this story that way.",1,"If you like the book, don't waste your time on this movie...",1166400000,"12 18, 2006",2006,3617,"['otherwise', 'will', 'be', 'sorely', 'disappointed.Ella', 'Enchanted', 'book', 'one', 'favorite', 'novels', 'ever', 'Gail', 'Carson', 'Levine', 'talented', 'author', 'who', 'can', 'craft', 'great', 'female', 'characters', 'moving', 'children', 'stories.The', 'movie', 'unfortunately', 'feels', 'sell-out.In', 'interview', 'related', 'release', 'movie', 'Levine', 'stated', 'allowed', 'movie', 'producers/directors', 'have', 'lot', 'liberty', 'story', 'only', 'thing', 'wanted', 'kept', 'was', 'Ella', 'be', 'obedient', 'book', 'only', 'aspect', 'kept.Ella', 'Enchanted', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'title', 'role', 'up', 'dealing', 'fairy', 'blessing', 'gift', 'obedience', 'gift', 'must', 'instantly', 'obey', 'whatever', 'command', 'thrown', 'be', 'true', 'order', 'off-hand', 'comment', 'looking', 'silly', 'admit', ""'re"", 'stupid', 'something', 'more', 'sinister', 'Ella', 'constant', 'danger', 'rather', 'annoying', 'trait', 'have', 'road', 'finding', 'fairy', 'godmother', 'hoping', 'curse', 'be', 'removed', 'prince', 'land', 'royal', 'conspiracy', 'happy', 'ending', 'bargain.While', 'book', 'intended', 'middle', 'school', 'audience', 'movie', 'feels', 'children', 'younger', 'Ella', 'book', 'sassy', 'curse', 'way', 'can', 'delaying', 'obedience', 'finding', 'clever', 'way', 'carrying', 'out', 'someone', 'orders', 'denying', 'true', 'spirit', 'command', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'Ella', 'little', 'more', 'puppet', 'even', 'acting', 'one', 'out', 'someone', 'order', 'little', 'spirit', 'character', 'have', 'wonder', 'how', 'even', 'able', 'carry', 'out', 'quest', 'wo', ""n't"", 'fight', 'back', 'day-to-day', 'life', 'how', 'can', 'fight', 'back', 'when', 'entire', 'kingdom', 'stake', 'movie', 'also', 'liberty', 'world', 'Ella', 'Enchanted', 'Levine', 'so', 'carefully', 'crafts', 'books', 'other', 'languages', 'other', 'races', 'other', 'species', 'Unfortunately', 'one', 'other', 'species', 'elves', 'are', 'reduced', 'comical', 'sidekick', 'kind', 'role', 'instead', 'stately', 'part', 'play', 'original', 'story', 'One', 'Ella', 'greatest', 'talents', 'learning', 'other', 'languages', ""n't"", 'even', 'come', 'play', 'movie', 'movie', 'things', ""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'book', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'particular', 'scene', 'where', 'Ella', 'forced', 'tell', 'friend', 'Arieda', 'must', 'end', 'friendship', 'could', 'never', 'be', 'friends', 'Ayorthaian', 'movie', 'never', 'up', 'prejudice', 'Ayorthaians', 'found', 'book', 'scene', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'know', 'Ella', 'Enchanted', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'set', 'Ayortha', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'one-dimensional', 'obvious', 'stepmother', 'stepsister', 'are', 'very', 'sterotypical', 'book', 'protagonists', 'Ella', 'Mandy', 'fairy', 'Prince', 'Char', 'have', 'depth', 'Mandy', 'particular', 'no-nonsense', 'practical', 'mentor', 'second', 'mother', 'Ella', 'movie', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'Mandy', 'fairy', 'reduced', 'comic', 'relief', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'magic', 'work', 'right.I', 'suppose', 'family', 'entertainment', 'movie', 'decent', 'think', 'producers', 'movie', 'had', 'chance', 'make', 'quality', 'children', 'film', 'instead', 'chose', 'make', 'glitzy', 'stylized', 'piece', 'fluff', 'book', 'powerful', 'moving', 'great', 'lessons', 'rising', 'adversity', 'selflessness', 'finding', 'place', 'world', 'movie', 'none', 'few', 'hours', 'mindless', 'drivel', 'Do', 'favor', 'read', 'novel', 'children', 'buy', ""'ll"", 'get', 'lot', 'more', 'story', 'way']",N/A

It seems the people who adapted the book into a screenplay said, ""Gee, how can we take this truly wonderful book, take out all the depth, and add a lot of stupid junk?""What happened to the finishing school?  Why wasn't the ball a masquerade?  Where were Lucinda's other 'gifts' and conditional redemption at the end?  Why were the great species and characters squished into boring 2-dimentional gimmicks?  The giants' wedding is fascinating in the book.  The glimpse into the elven world is beautiful.  Ella had a defiance and a knack for languages that fleshed her out from just a pretty face into a real character.  Speaking of Ella, what happened to her surprise heritage?  And the curse-breaking is the climax, not half-time!  It was so much more dramatic in the book too, despite there being no daggers involved.  The unicorn-hair soup, the gnome child, the palace's banisters, Hattie's hair, Sir Peter's books...  Even such minor details are vital to the magic of the book, which is so conspicuously absent from the movie.If you're wondering what was added that wasn't originally in the book, just look for anything incredibly stupid.  Prince Char having a fan-club comprised of annoying, giggly teeny-boppers.  The book being a transformed man.  The talking snake.  The incredibly over-used cliche of the regent seeking to permanently secure the throne.  The incredible let-down of how said regent is defeated at the end.  Ella's ridiculous ability to obey even when it defies the laws of physics or her actual abilities.  Singing and dancing elves.  All of the anachronisms.  I don't know where any of these things came from, but they didn't come from the book!Please, do yourself a huge favor and read the book instead.

From the very beginning we are sucked into this world of magic and fantasy and we stay there until the end when the narrator tells us we have to go back to the real world.We join Ella on a magical journey to find her godmother to remove a spell that was cast on her as a baby. As she travels across the country she meets elves, ogres, giants, and the handsome prince (in leather pants).Hathaway makes Ella real and gives her emotion, crucial to make this more than just a fairy tale. She makes Ella someone we can all relate to by giving her depth. Her best acting comes when the Evil Uncle discovers her curse and when she has to stab Char (in the leather pants). It was beautifully shot.Of course this movie is more humor than seriousness. And the humor is excellent. For most of the movie the entire theater was laughing at the jokes, which is a good thing for a comedy.Of course I can't end a review for this movie without mentioning the singing. Hathaway sings a song at the giant wedding, she is excellent. When I first found out Anne was going to sing in this movie I was nervous for her. But she does an excellent job.

614460,A33CLVW2K7SL1P,B00005JM5Q,Jonathan Appleseed,"[5, 6]","This is one enchanting film. Sometimes when movies or books borrow little bits and pieces from other movies or books, the result is an offending plagiarism. In this case, however, the result is a marvelously captivating story. Some of the bits and pieces that you'll find in here are: Cinderella, Shrek, The Princess Bride, Hamlet, Macbeth, and maybe even a touch of Peter Jackson's The Fellowship of the Ring, with the warm comfort of the countryside (although this time people are living in houses, of course, and not Hobbit holes).When Ella is born, an extremely untalented fairy with a penchant for drunken flying bestows her with a ""gift"", a gift of obedience. Whatever someone tells her, she is bound by the spell Lucinda placed upon her. Lucinda, in her arrogance, never stopped to think about the consequences of such a gift, and half the fun of the film is watching Ella perform her mean stepsisters, or even Cary Elwes character, Sir Regal, when he instructs her to ""shake her booty"".The cast is absolutely extraordinary, and I love that Cary Elwes is playing a dark haired wicked regent, when his role in The Princess Bride was that of a blond beauty who saved the princess and the kingdom from another wicked, dark haired ruler. (It's interesting to note that when Elwes appeared in The Princess Bride he was far more charming and attractive than Hugh Dancy, but that's really immaterial.) Eric Idle as the narrator, speaking always in an entertaining rhyme, is delightful, but the character that shines above all is Anne Hathaway, a young woman of breathtaking beauty. If ever there was a princess (and she's played a princess three times now!) she's it. She has all of the innocence, all of assumed common sense necessary for the role.The movies greatest strengths lie in humor. From a book that's really Ella's house fairy's boyfriend (Ella's house fairy isn't remarkably gifted, as she turned him into that book), to comments like, ""Stop licking the foyer!"" when a group of crazed girls start licking the castle floor because Prince Char walked on it, it's humor that's complete, not relying on one-trick ponies.This is a warm and wonderful family film, and even if it did depart a bit from the book to try and look a bit like Shrek, that's perfectly fine and entirely forgivable.",5,Ella is enchanting,1096329600,"09 28, 2004",2004,2296,"['one', 'enchanting', 'film', 'Sometimes', 'when', 'movies', 'books', 'borrow', 'little', 'bits', 'pieces', 'other', 'movies', 'books', 'result', 'offending', 'plagiarism', 'case', 'however', 'result', 'marvelously', 'captivating', 'story', 'bits', 'pieces', ""'ll"", 'find', 'here', 'are', 'Cinderella', 'Shrek', 'Princess', 'Bride', 'Hamlet', 'Macbeth', 'maybe', 'even', 'touch', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'Fellowship', 'Ring', 'warm', 'comfort', 'countryside', 'time', 'people', 'are', 'living', 'houses', 'course', 'not', 'Hobbit', 'holes', '.When', 'Ella', 'born', 'extremely', 'untalented', 'fairy', 'penchant', 'drunken', 'flying', 'gift', 'gift', 'obedience', 'someone', 'bound', 'spell', 'Lucinda', 'placed', 'Lucinda', 'arrogance', 'never', 'stopped', 'think', 'consequences', 'such', 'gift', 'fun', 'film', 'watching', 'Ella', 'perform', 'mean', 'stepsisters', 'even', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'character', 'Sir', 'Regal', 'when', 'shake', 'booty', '.The', 'cast', 'absolutely', 'extraordinary', 'love', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'playing', 'dark', 'haired', 'wicked', 'regent', 'when', 'role', 'Princess', 'Bride', 'was', 'blond', 'beauty', 'who', 'saved', 'princess', 'kingdom', 'wicked', 'dark', 'haired', 'ruler', 'interesting', 'note', 'when', 'Elwes', 'appeared', 'Princess', 'Bride', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'charming', 'attractive', 'Hugh', 'Dancy', 'really', 'immaterial', 'Eric', 'Idle', 'narrator', 'speaking', 'always', 'entertaining', 'rhyme', 'delightful', 'character', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'young', 'woman', 'breathtaking', 'beauty', 'ever', 'was', 'princess', 'played', 'princess', 'three', 'times', 'now', 'innocence', 'assumed', 'common', 'sense', 'necessary', 'role.The', 'movies', 'greatest', 'strengths', 'lie', 'humor', 'book', 'really', 'Ella', 'house', 'fairy', 'boyfriend', 'Ella', 'house', 'fairy', ""n't"", 'remarkably', 'gifted', 'turned', 'book', 'comments', 'Stop', 'licking', 'foyer', 'when', 'group', 'crazed', 'girls', 'start', 'licking', 'castle', 'floor', 'Prince', 'Char', 'walked', 'humor', 'complete', 'not', 'relying', 'one-trick', 'ponies.This', 'warm', 'wonderful', 'family', 'film', 'even', 'did', 'depart', 'bit', 'book', 'try', 'look', 'bit', 'Shrek', 'perfectly', 'fine', 'entirely', 'forgivable']",N/A

614469,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B00005JM5Q,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[3, 3]","""Ella Enchanted"" is a fun film for all ages.  There is enough adventure for older kids and a great little love story for soft hearts and young girls.  My three year-old daughter has completely engulfed herself into anything princess these days, from the Disney Princesses to movies with damsels in distress, she loves it all.  Of course, Ella has captured her heart for many reasons, she's funny, beautiful, independent, and sings and dances in this film.Anne Hathaway is truly a beautiful sight to see onscreen.  She has a simple look to her that isn't plagued by slutty costumes or too much makeup.  Also, Hathaway seems to be cornering the market on young free-thinking do-gooders, which makes her a good role model for any young girl.The film itself is fun to watch.  It is definitely geared at a younger age group, but I find myself watching it with my daughter every time she asks to see it.  There's music, comedy, dancing, and plenty of other things to keep anyone interested.Lucy Punch is downright hilarious as Ella's evil stepsister, Hattie.  Prince Char is played with dash and flair by Hugh Dancy.  Even better is Cary Elwes as the devilishly funny uncle of Char who, as in every fairy tale, wants to eliminate the competition so that he can become king.  The rest of the cast is wonderful, most notably Minnie Driver as a house fairy who lends her boyfriend(he's a book) to Ella so that she can find the well-meaning but mean-tempered fairy(Vivica A. Fox) who ""enchanted"" her by making her obedient to any and every command given to her.There are bits and pieces of a ton of other fairy tales and films scattered throughout this story, but no so much that they are annoying.  ""Shrek"" is represented best by the contemporary languge used in the film, a few musical numbers and the modern feel of the towns visited by Ella and her companions(they have escalors and a community college).  Disney's adaptation of ""Robin Hood"" is here thanks to Elwes' talking snake.  You can even see a remote ""Matrix""-like reference in the big fight scene with ogres(though it seemed more like a nod to Princess Fiona's martial artistry in ""Shrek"").Overall, a good film for the whole family.  I don't recall any strong language, just a few adult inside jokes.  One of my favorites is when Benny, Driver's bookish boyfriend, refers to an elf's dream of becoming a lawyer as ""small claims court, no doubt.""Highly recommended to families with children twelve and under, or for anyone who wants to watch a fun film with nothing too offensive in its bag of tricks.",4,Quite Enchanting,1114041600,"04 21, 2005",2005,2553,"['Ella', 'Enchanted', 'fun', 'film', 'ages', 'enough', 'adventure', 'older', 'kids', 'great', 'little', 'love', 'story', 'soft', 'hearts', 'young', 'girls', 'three', 'year-old', 'daughter', 'completely', 'engulfed', 'anything', 'princess', 'days', 'Disney', 'Princesses', 'movies', 'damsels', 'distress', 'course', 'Ella', 'captured', 'heart', 'many', 'reasons', 'funny', 'beautiful', 'independent', 'sings', 'dances', 'film.Anne', 'Hathaway', 'truly', 'beautiful', 'sight', 'see', 'onscreen', 'simple', 'look', ""n't"", 'plagued', 'slutty', 'costumes', 'too', 'much', 'makeup', 'Also', 'Hathaway', 'be', 'cornering', 'market', 'young', 'free-thinking', 'do-gooders', 'good', 'role', 'model', 'young', 'girl.The', 'film', 'fun', 'watch', 'definitely', 'geared', 'younger', 'age', 'group', 'find', 'watching', 'daughter', 'time', 'see', 'music', 'comedy', 'dancing', 'plenty', 'other', 'things', 'keep', 'anyone', 'interested.Lucy', 'Punch', 'downright', 'hilarious', 'Ella', 'evil', 'stepsister', 'Hattie', 'Prince', 'Char', 'played', 'dash', 'flair', 'Hugh', 'Dancy', 'Even', 'better', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'devilishly', 'funny', 'uncle', 'Char', 'who', 'fairy', 'tale', 'eliminate', 'competition', 'so', 'can', 'become', 'king', 'rest', 'cast', 'wonderful', 'most', 'notably', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'house', 'fairy', 'who', 'boyfriend', 'book', 'Ella', 'can', 'find', 'well-meaning', 'mean-tempered', 'fairy', 'Vivica', 'A', 'Fox', 'who', 'enchanted', 'making', 'obedient', 'command', 'given', 'are', 'bits', 'pieces', 'ton', 'other', 'fairy', 'tales', 'films', 'scattered', 'story', 'so', 'much', 'are', 'annoying', 'Shrek', 'represented', 'best', 'contemporary', 'languge', 'used', 'film', 'few', 'musical', 'numbers', 'modern', 'feel', 'towns', 'visited', 'Ella', 'companions', 'have', 'escalors', 'community', 'college', 'Disney', 'adaptation', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'here', 'thanks', 'Elwes', 'talking', 'snake', 'can', 'even', 'see', 'remote', 'Matrix', '-like', 'reference', 'big', 'fight', 'scene', 'ogres', 'seemed', 'more', 'nod', 'Princess', 'Fiona', 'martial', 'artistry', 'Shrek', '.Overall', 'good', 'film', 'whole', 'family', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'strong', 'language', 'just', 'few', 'adult', 'jokes', 'One', 'favorites', 'when', 'Benny', 'Driver', 'bookish', 'boyfriend', 'refers', 'elf', 'dream', 'becoming', 'lawyer', 'small', 'claims', 'court', 'doubt', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'families', 'children', 'twelve', 'anyone', 'who', 'watch', 'fun', 'film', 'nothing', 'too', 'offensive', 'bag', 'tricks']",N/A
614470,A2PUFROLTTRLRC,B00005JM5Q,Kindle Customer,"[1, 2]","Ella Enchanted is one of the best books I have ever read. The movie? Not quite. There are a lot of differences and departures from the original, although most of it was simply expansion on a sentence or two from the book, like Ella's fear that if she marries Char, one of his enemies will discover her curse and force her to kill him. Some things, though, had me blinking and saying something like,""Where did THAT come from?"" Example. What inspired the stupid animated snake? To my mind, if someone had simply squaushed the thing while it was hidden in the saddlebag, the movie could have progressed quite happily without it. Also, the dance number at the end was, I admit, amusing, but what purpose does it serve? Moving on, I actually liked most of the modern quirks, like the party in Giantland(such an original name, by the way!), Dame Olga's unfortunate reaction to her Batox injectons, Prince Char's fan club, and the mall opening in Frell. I have to say, the casting was really well done, to the point where one can't imagine anyone better for the parts than the actual actors. Although I still think if they had stayed true to the book, the movie would have gone beyond good to great.

614476,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JM5Q,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[38, 48]","There are two things that colored my perception of ""Ella Enchanted.""  The first is that I just saw ""A Cinderella Story"" a couple of weeks ago, and since that was the worst movie made on the Cinderella theme in the history of the world anything else was going to look a lot better in comparison.  But then director Tommy O'Haver has the advantage of being able to mine the gold from Gail Carson Levine's beloved children's novel, which provides enough creative sparks to make this movie something different.  If you are going to tell the Cinderella story over again then you need to have a twist that justifies the effort, and ""Ella Enchanted"" has a couple of those.Second, this really is a movie aimed at kids.  I say this because the key twist in this story is that when Ella is born a rather second rate fairy named Lucinda (Vivica A. Fox) gives her the gift of obedience.  This means that every time somebody tells Ella to do something, she has to do it.  Now, for kids, younger kids, this is a truly nightmare scenario.  Parents and other adults are always telling you to do something: what if they could MAKE you do whatever they wanted?  Endless chores, homework, and probably music lessons would be your fate, which is essentially what happens to Ella when she grows up to be Anne Hathaway.Hathaway is the star of this film and what promise she showed in ""The Princess Dairies"" is fulfilled her as she plays Ella as more of a civil rights advocate than a would be fairy princess.  This is because in the other fun twist the regent, Prince Edgar (Carl Elwes, playing for the other side this time having done the hero bit in ""The Princess Bride""), has ordered all the elves, ogres, giants and other non-humans to live in the forest, at least when they are not serving as slave labor in behalf of the kingdom.  Ella knows this is wrong and while every other eligible maiden in the land is throwing themselves at the feet of Prince Charmont (Hugh Dancy), Ella is more interested in giving the heir a piece of her mind on the eve of his coronation.Since this is a take off of a sort on Cinderella we have to have the wicked step mother (Joanna Lumley) and her daughters, the mean one, Hattie (Lucy Punch), and the stupid one, Olive (Jennifer Higham).  One of the most problematic elements in the story is where the good and kindly father (Patrick Bergin) marries the wrong woman.  When the fairy tale was first told it was commonplace for widows and widowers to marry (it worked well for young Abraham Lincoln), but now adays the logic of such marriages is a hit and miss proposition: we buy it in ""Ever After"" and we laugh at it in ""A Cinderella Story.""  At least Ella's dad is not dead but simply off on business while his new wife and step-daughters treat Ella like she was a maid who gets dirty from the cinders in the fireplace.I saw this 2004 film is aimed at kids because the injustices that Hattie heaps on Ella are going to drive the young ones right through the roof.  I am old enough to know that things will work out for Ella in the end and I suspect most kids will know that too, but I am also old enough to want Hattie to get more of a comeuppance than she does in this film (or its alternative ending).  But then I also know why the original Cinderella wore glass slippers (I cannot explain it because children might read this review; if you ever read the original story of ""The Little Mermaid"" then you know that most of the classic fairy tales talk a walk on the dark side).There are lots of creative little touches that help this film along.  Mandy (Minnie Driver), the inept house fairy who tries to look after Ella, has a boyfriend named Benny (Jimi Mistry), who is trapped in a book.  Open the book and Benny can show you where somebody is and what they are doing, which becomes helpful as Ella tries to find Lucinda to take back her gift and help save the day at the end of the film.  What I really liked is how the enchantment is broken, which worked on at least two significant levels, which is two more than you usually get in a Hollywood film.The only reason ""Ella Enchanted"" is not a truly superb film is because we have seen bits and pieces of this fractured fairy tale approach in things like ""Into the Woods"" and ""Shrek.""  I would also toss out a working hypothesis that there are only so many variations on the Cinderella theme that you are willing to admit to the first level.  For me that would be ""Pretty Woman"" and ""Ever After"" (having Hector Elizondo or Leonardo Da Vinci in the fairy godmother role appeals to me), but for young kids they might fall in love with ""Ella Enchanted"" in the same way.Anne Hathaway makes that easy to do, especially when her character is forced to belt out a cover of Queen's ""Somebody to Love.""  She has those big eyes and that bright smile and spins enough magic in this movie to make up for a by-the-numbers wasted sequel like ""The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement.""  Obviously she needs to break out of the ""princess"" mode and her next film, ""Havoc,"" should provide that: she plays a wealthy L.A. teen who imitates the gangsta lifestyle of hip hop culture with her friends and then encounters a gang of real Latino drug dealers in the big bad city.  Yep, that should break Hathaway out of the princess rut.",4,If Ella is not enchanted then Anne Hathaway certainly is,1093564800,"08 27, 2004",2004,5281,"['are', 'two', 'things', 'colored',

614477,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B00005JM5Q,Lawyeraau,"[6, 7]","Based upon Gail Carson Levine's award winning children's book of the same name, this is a delightful film that is fun for all ages. Starring the absolutely luminous Anne Hathaway in the role of Ella, the film is really a lot of fun. It is an interesting mix of the contemporary and the days of long ago when elves, ogres, and giants roamed the earth (at least in the minds of those with a fertile imagination).Once upon a time, when Ella of Frell was born, a second rate fairy godmother, Lucinda Perryweather (Viveca A. Fox), gave her the gift of obedience against the express wishes of Ella's mother and the resident house fairy, the inept Mandy (Minnie Driver). As Ella grows up, this gift of obedience causes her to be thought of as being a little odd. Still, she has a lot of grit and spunk, as well as a mind of her own, and always seems to be championing the underdog.After her mother (Donna Dent) dies, Ella's world eventually comes crashing down upon her, when her father, Sir Peter (Patrick Bergin), a traveling salesman with cash flow problems, marries the nasty but rich Dame Olga (Joanna Lumley) who has two daughters, cruel and cunning Hattie (Lucy Punch) and stupid Olive (Jennifer Higham). When Hattie discovers Ella's propensity for doing exactly as she is told, she takes advantage of Ella, making her do her bidding. Let the games begin!Meanwhile, Hattie is president of the Prince Charmant (Hugh Dancy) fan club. Prince Char, as he is called by his fans , is a total teen dream and has all the popularity of a pop star. He is, however, getting ready to be crowned King, as he is reaching the age of majority. His kingdom has been governed for some time by his uncle, Sir Edgar (Cary Elwes), who took the reins of government when his brother, who was the late King, as well as Char's father, was killed, ostensibly by ogres. Since his rise to power, Sir Edgar has made sweeping changes in the land, segregating all giants, ogres, and elves from humans and circumscribing their lives in harsh and humiliating ways.Ella, who advocates for all underdogs, protests against Prince Char when he makes an appearance in solidarity for the elves, ogres, and giants whom she champions. Of course, the handsome prince is smitten by the lovely Ella, and who wouldn't be? Meanwhile, Ella, having had it with the gift of obedience, decides to go on a journey to look for her fairy godmother, Lucinda, in hopes of getting her to take back her gift of obedience. She takes along Mandy's handsome boyfriend, Benny (Jimi Mistry), who happens to be trapped in a book, because one of Mandy's spells backfired. Since the book is a magical book, Benny can show Ella where anyone is, whenever the book is opened. He is basically her road map.Off they go. Along the way, Ella meets up with Slannen the Elf (Aidan McArdle), as well as other elves, ogres, and giants. Along the road, she also meets up with Prince Char, who happens to be in the right place at the right time when Ella runs into some hungry ogres. Consequently, Ella and Char get to know each other and begin to fall in love. Unbeknownst to Char, however, a spy is traveling with him, Sir Edgar's pet snake and advisor, Heston. Once Heston reports back to Sir Edgar, a series of events is set into motion that Sir Edgar hopes will keep the reins of power firmly in his grasp.Anne Hathaway is simply enchanting as the grown up Ella, with a thousand kilowatt smile that will light up any screen. She has wonderful comedic timing and is absolutely perfect in her role. She can certainly also sing and dance. Hugh Dancy is likewise good in the role of the handsome Prince Char. The romantic chemistry between Ella and Char is palpable. Cary Elwes, sinisterly handsome as Sir Edward, takes to his role with gusto and is absolutely wonderful. Steve Coogan's silky voice over for Heston the Snake is suitably malevolent sounding, making for an apt companion to Sir Edgar. The rest of the supporting cast is likewise excellent.The direction by Thomas O'Haver is deft, as he expertly mixes contemporary touches with the fairytale aspects of the story, which often makes for some memorable moments in the film. Who can forget Ella's song and dance number in the giants' club? This intermeshing of contemporary touches with what is essentially a fairytale is a contrivance that proved to be very successful in ""A Knight's Tale"". Here, it is likewise used to good effect and offers many delightful surprises. These surprising contemporary touches are laced throughout this film, keeping the viewer attentive. This is a wonderful production that boasts an excellent screenplay. Viewers will simply be enchanted by this charming film, which is fun for all ages.",4,ELLA IS ENCHANTING...,1119916800,"06 28, 2005",2005,4705,"['Based', 'Gail', 'Carson', 'Levine', 'award', 'winning', 'children', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'delightful', 'film', 'fun', 'ages', 'Starring', 'absolutely', 'luminous', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'role', 'Ella', 'film', 'really', 'lot', 'fun', 'interesting', 'mix', 'contemporary', 'days', 'long', 'ago', 'when', 'elves', 'ogres', 'giants', 'roamed', 'earth', 'least', 'minds', 'fertile', 'imagination', '.Once', 'time', 'when', 'Ella', 'Frell', 'was', 'born', 'second', 'rate', 'fairy', 'godmother', 'Lucinda', 'Perryweather', 'Viveca', 'A', 'Fox', 'gave', 'gift', 'obedience', 'express', 'wishes', 'Ella', 'mother', 'resident', 'house', 'fairy', 'inept', 'Mandy', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'Ella', 'up', 'gift', 'obedience', 'be', 'thought', 'being', 'little', 'odd', 'Still', 'lot', 'grit', 'spunk', 'as', 'well', 'mind', 'own', 'always', 'be', 'championing', 'underdog.After', 'mother', 'Donna', 'Dent', 'Ella', 'world', 'eventually', 'crashing', 'down', 'when', 'father', 'Sir', 'Peter', 'Patrick', 'Bergin', 'traveling', 'salesman', 'cash', 'flow', 'problems', 'nasty', 'rich', 'Dame', 'Olga', 'Joanna', 'Lumley', 'who', 'two', 'daughters', 'cruel', 'cunning', 'Hattie', 'Lucy', 'Punch', 'stupid', 'Olive', 'Jennifer', 'Higham', 'When', 'Hattie', 'Ella', 'propensity', 'doing', 'exactly', 'told', 'advantage', 'Ella', 'making', 'do', 'bidding', 'Let', 'games', 'begin', 'Meanwhile', 'Hattie', 'president', 'Prince', 'Charmant', 'Hugh', 'Dancy', 'fan', 'club', 'Prince', 'Char', 'called', 'fans', 'total', 'teen', 'dream', 'popularity', 'pop', 'star', 'however', 'getting', 'ready', 'be', 'crowned', 'King', 'reaching', 'age', 'majority', 'kingdom', 'been', 'governed', 'time', 'uncle', 'Sir', 'Edgar', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'who', 'took', 'reins', 'government', 'when', 'brother', 'who', 'was', 'late', 'King', 'as', 'well', 'Char', 'father', 'was', 'killed', 'ostensibly', 'ogres', 'rise', 'power', 'Sir', 'Edgar', 'made', 'sweeping', 'changes', 'land', 'segregating', 'giants', 'ogres', 'elves', 'humans', 'circumscribing', 'lives', 'harsh', 'humiliating', 'ways.Ella', 'who', 'underdogs', 'protests', 'Prince', 'Char', 'when', 'appearance', 'solidarity', 'elves', 'ogres', 'giants', 'whom', 'champions', 'course', 'handsome', 'prince', 'smitten', 'lovely', 'Ella', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'Meanwhile', 'Ella', 'having', 'had', 'gift', 'obedience', 'go', 'journey', 'look', 'fairy', 'godmother', 'Lucinda', 'hopes', 'getting', 'take', 'back', 'gift', 'obedience', 'Mandy', 'handsome', 'boyfriend', 'Benny', 'Jimi', 'Mistry', 'who', 'be', 'trapped', 'book', 'one', 'Mandy', 'spells', 'backfired', 'book', 'magical', 'book', 'Benny', 'can', 'show', 'Ella', 'where', 'anyone', 'whenever', 'book', 'opened', 'basically', 'road', 'map.Off', 'go', 'way', 'Ella', 'up', 'Slannen', 'Elf', 'Aidan', 'McArdle', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'elves', 'ogres', 'giants', 'road', 'also', 'up', 'Prince', 'Char', 'who', 'be', 'right', 'place', 'right', 'time', 'when', 'Ella', 'hungry', 'ogres', 'Consequently', 'Ella', 'Char', 'get', 'know', 'other', 'begin', 'fall', 'love', 'Unbeknownst', 'Char', 'however', 'spy', 'traveling', 'Sir', 'Edgar', 'pet', 'snake', 'advisor', 'Heston', 'Once', 'Heston', 'back', 'Sir', 'Edgar', 'series', 'events', 'set', 'motion', 'Sir', 'Edgar', 'will', 'keep', 'reins', 'power', 'firmly', 'grasp.Anne', 'Hathaway', 'simply', 'enchanting', 'grown', 'up', 'Ella', 'thousand', 'kilowatt', 'smile', 'will', 'light', 'up', 'screen', 'wonderful', 'comedic', 'timing', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'role', 'can', 'certainly', 'also', 'sing', 'dance', 'Hugh', 'Dancy', 'likewise', 'good', 'role', 'handsome', 'Prince', 'Char', 'romantic', 'chemistry', 'Ella', 'Char', 'palpable', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'sinisterly', 'handsome', 'Sir', 'Edward', 'role', 'gusto', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'Steve', 'Coogan', 'silky', 'voice', 'Heston', 'Snake', 'suitably', 'malevolent', 'sounding', 'making', 'apt', 'companion', 'Sir', 'Edgar', 'rest', 'supporting', 'cast', 'likewise', 'excellent.The', 'direction', 'Thomas', ""O'Haver"", 'deft', 'expertly', 'mixes', 'contemporary', 'touches', 'fairytale', 'aspects', 'story', 'often', 'memorable', 'moments', 'film', 'Who', 'can', 'forget', 'Ella', 'song', 'dance', 'number', 'giants', 'club', 'intermeshing', 'contemporary', 'touches', 'what', 'essentially', 'fairytale', 'contrivance', 'proved', 'be', 'very', 'successful', 'A', 'Knight', 'Tale', 'Here', 'likewise', 'used', 'good', 'effect', 'many', 'delightful', 'surprises', 'surprising', 'contemporary', 'touches', 'are', 'laced', 'film', 'keeping', 'viewer', 'attentive', 'wonderful', 'production', 'excellent', 'screenplay', 'Viewers', 'will', 'simply', 'be', 'enchanted', 'charming', 'film', 'fun', 'ages']",N/A

It's a worthy attempt, but unfortunately, they tried too hard for the movie.One of the great things about the book is that Ella is a strong-willed and intelligent girl, despite her curse. She encounters trials throughout her journey that show her strength. The movie version tried to highlight her character traits by giving her political causes and an outspoken character, but you don't need this to show her strength! I found a lot of the changes to be unnecessary, and even the character relationships changed (i.e. between Ella and her father, between Ella and Mandy, Mandy and her book boyfriend, Ella and Slanen the elf, etc.). I think the movie also went over the top with a lot of the fairy tale fantasy, whereas it left out a lot of the fairy tale quality that the book possessed. The cheesy musical number at the end is just too much to bear as well.The reason I gave this two stars is because it does have redeeming qualities. I enjoy Anne Hathaway and Hugh Dancy together, and I think they did a good job with what they were given.

This one is based on a novel, and in it the Ella character (played by Hathaway) is given the gift of obedience by a fairy godmother when she is a baby. This of course leads to all sorts of challenges, as she has to do whatever someone says when they order her too. Once her new evil step-sisters (ala Cinderella) figure this out, they use it to try and get their way, and to foil the growing romance between Ella and a young prince. Ella must try and find her fairy godmother to get her to remove the gift, which the godmother does not want to do.Hathaway is at her comedic best here, and all the supporting cast does a fine job.

The opening is somewhat like ""Sleeping Beauty"" mixed with Cinderella.  Only Ella (Anne Hathaway of the ""Princess Diaries"" fame) receives the gift of obedience from fairy Lucinda Perryweather (Vivica A. Fox).  While the ""gift"" may be convenient for parents seeking a child that does what it is told, the ""gift"" turns into a nightmare for poor Ella as she is taken advantage of by her wicked step sisters Hattie (Lucy Punch, who was in similar movie ""The 10th Kingdom"") and Olive (Jennifer Higham) and pretender to the throne Sir Edgar (Cary Elwes of ""The Princess Bride"" and ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights""), who is Prince Char's uncle.There are a number of corny gags throughout the movie.  The choreography is a funny combination of classical dancing with modern dancing of various styles, short skirts and hot outfits. A few moments are semi-scary, but those last a short time before a joke breaks things up.  Prince Char (Hugh Dancy) is supposedly handsome and has all the eligible (and some not-so-eligible) women drooling.  There are giants, elves, ogres and a talking snake.  What more could you want in a movie?This movie moves along nicely, never taking itself seriously, so I am happy with the goofy moments that occur liberally throughout the movie.

Alcat ""Curiosity killed the cat, but sa...","[4, 4]","""Ella enchanted"" is a fairytale with an interesting spin, that is likely to interest both children and those adults who haven't lost contact with the children inside them. The film is based on the novel of the same name written by Gail Carson Levine, although it differs from it in several points. I think that doesn't detract from the fact that this movie is very good. As a matter of fact, I consider it a plus, because due to the differences between the movie and the book you can watch the film and still get some surprises if you read the book afterwards (or vice versa).The main character in this film is Ella of Krell (Anne Hathaway), a teenager who was given a strange ""gift"" by her eccentric fairy godmother (played by Vivica A. Fox) when she was born. That gift is nothing less that the ""gift of obedience"": everything that she is ordered to do, she automatically does. Her ""gift"" doesn't make life too difficult for Ella at the beginning, as only her mother and her aunt (Minnie Driver) know about it. Of course, Ella is annoyed by the fact that she always has to do what they order (and yes, that includes homework and music lessons), but they never ask her to do nothing bad.Unfortunately, Ella's life takes a turn for the worse when her mother dies and her father Patrick Bergin) must remarry for money. She ends up having a stereotypical hateful stepmother, and stepsisters from hell. One of her stepsisters, Hattie (Lucy Punch), discovers Ella's secret, and makes more or less a slave of her. That impossible situation prompts Ella to start a quest in search of her fairy godmother, the only one who can remove her ""gift"" from her.If you watch this movie, you will get lots of adventure and action, along with some interesting characters. For example, you will be introduced to ogres, giants, elves, and even a magic book that can talk. There is also some romance, as Ella gets to know Prince Charming (Hugh Dancy), a young man always running from his crazy fans who is about to be crowned. ""Char"" is not as dumb as Ella thought, and is oblivious of the new laws against equal rights sanctioned by his uncle Edgar, the regent (the villain, of course). Will Ella be able to show Char what is really going on in his kingdom?. And will she be able to get rid of her ""gift of obedience"", or will it go on being used against her?.On the whole, I can sincerely say that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and that I recommend it to you. ""Ella enchanted"" is really original, and a pleasure to watch. If you decide to see it, remember to play the deleted scenes.

Why did they feel the need to borrow the landscape, and have a talking snake, instead of a talking donkey? (Which by the way was voiced strangely enough by an unrecognisable Steve Coogan. Obviously his normal voice instead of his Alan Partridge voice)This movie wasn't as good as A Cinderella Story, which I already reviewed. It just didn't have the same magic, and does Hugh Dancy actually own a brush?! Is this what teenage girls fancy nowadays?Lamia, the name of the city where Prince Char lives, is Latin for Witch or Vampire. Does anyone else think this was a indirect reference to Narnia, since it sounds so similar?There is a whole host of stars in this, and you'll be trying to spot the stars (or in Steve Coogan's case his voice) rather than paying attention to the movie. Who did you spot? Cary Elwes, Joanna Lumley, Minnie Driver, Eric Idle, Jimi Mistry, Vivica A. Fox, Parminder Nagra, and Heidi Klum.I think Anne Hathaway is a really good up and coming actress, but she's going to need to spread out her wings a bit, and stop taking these roles. Her character is no different from the character in Princess Diaries.Like Shrek, there's a lot of modern-day references thrown into this, including the man powered escalator in the mall - and is that a lift I see in the background?There are two song & dance sequences in this, totally corny beyond belief, and feeling a little out of place - and this is from a girl who loves Grease! I was quite surprised to see in the extras that it is actually Anne Hathaway singing (bets are on for her being the next Lindsay Lohan) - but not Hugh Dancy! She murders the classics she does sing though, including ""Somebody To Love"" by Queen, and ""Don't Go Breaking My Heart"" by Elton John & Kiki Dee. Other well-known songs included on the soundtrack are ""Walking on Sunshine"" and ""You Make Me Feel Like Dancing"".The extras include: commentary; deleted and extended scenes; ""Prince Charmont's Fan Club"" set-top game (how dull); Ella Enchanted Red Carpet Premiere Special (basically repreats all the other extras included); ""Happily Ever After"" DVD rom feature and a music video ""It's Not Just Make Believe"" Performed by Kari Kimmel.I'm still not sure what to make of this movie, and have been left really sitting on the fence at the end of it all.

I think Hugh Dancy was good, except that his part was not very good. Minnie Driver I recently discovered, and I like her. But Mandy wasn't a young pretty woman, she was a strict cook. Cary Elwes is brilliant, of course, but where did that character come from?!Ella Enchanted, by Gail Carsen Levine, is one of my favorite books in the whole world. The story is enchanting, and the characters are alive. Char is sweet and funny, Ella is full of emotion. In the book. In the movie, all the sweetness of the book is gone. Vanished. Mutilated into things that aren't funny at all, just stupid.The directors (who don't deserve to be mention by name) tried to put the story into a 'modern' light or something - moving staircases, a prince fan club - and it ruined the harmless fairy-tale realm.The two stepsisters were horrid - and I don't mean evil, like in the book (though they were, slightly), they were just horrid.Instead of making the tale one of a brilliant girl, bound by obedience, struggling to be happy, and winning the friendship of a humorous prince, the story is one of an evil uncle trying to kill his relatives (including Char) to take possession of the throne. Why did this villain have to enter the story? I think that, in the book, Ella's family was bad enough as villains (her father included) - why did they have to go and add a power-hungry uncle?And, to top it all off, this 'Cinderella story' has nothing to do with Cinderella, aside from the fact her name is Ella and she has a wicked stepmother and two wicked stepsisters. The book had the glass slippers and the three balls, what about the movie? None at all.Even if you don't compare the movie to the book, it was still awful.

If you are one of those people who needed to read the book first before watching the movie, I would recommend don't, and enjoy the movie prior reading the novel it is base on. Only the characters and their background are the same between the two.Anyway, it's a cute modern based fairy tale about a young woman named Ella (Anne Hathaway) of Frell, who has been unfortunately given the gift of Obedience by a fairy named Lucinda Her mother died early only to leave her to the care to their housefairy, Mandy, who make sure to keep her safe and love in their home Her father however was around, married Madam Olga who has two annoying dauhters named Hattie (the president of Prince Charmont's fanclub) and Olive. Annoyed with her cursed gift, she when off to look for Lucinda, and Mandy gave her a magic book, Benny (once her boyfriend, which she accidentally changed into a book). On her way to a wedding to look for Lucinda, she met an elf, Slannen and Prince Charmont (whom she disapprove of earlier in the movie)This movie is a dvd parents should get for their kids for their shelves cause it's hilarious and easy to watch. I wish they have a sequel for this one day but it is great as it is.Regardless the nagging part of me that regress this movie because 98% of the movie just isn't from the book at all, but it can stand alone as an original movie just like that, but it's not from the same book I've read.",4,"Good as a stand alone original movie, but not the same book",1136419200,"01 5, 2006",2006,1507,"['Ella', 'Enchanted', 'movie', 'very', 'lightly', 'base', 'novel', 'written', 'Gail', 'Carson', 'Levine', 'are', 'one', 'people', 'who', 'needed', 'read', 'book', 'first', 'watching', 'movie', 'would', 'recommend', 'do', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'movie', 'prior', 'reading', 'novel', 'base', 'Only', 'characters', 'background', 'are', 'same', 'two.Anyway', 'cute', 'modern', 'based', 'fairy', 'tale', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Ella', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'Frell', 'who', 'been', 'unfortunately', 'given', 'gift', 'Obedience', 'fairy', 'named', 'Lucinda', 'Her', 'mother', 'died', 'early', 'only', 'leave', 'care', 'housefairy', 'Mandy', 'who', 'make', 'sure', 'keep', 'safe', 'love', 'home', 'father', 'however', 'was', 'around', 'married', 'Madam', 'Olga', 'who', 'two', 'annoying', 'dauhters', 'named', 'Hattie', 'president', 'Prince', 'Charmont', 'fanclub', 'Olive', 'Annoyed', 'cursed', 'gift', 'when', 'look', 'Lucinda', 'Mandy', 'gave', 'magic', 'book', 'Benny', 'once', 'boyfriend', 'accidentally', 'changed', 'book', 'way', 'wedding', 'look', 'Lucinda', 'met', 'elf', 'Slannen', 'Prince', 'Charmont', 'whom', 'disapprove', 'earlier', 'movie', 'movie', 'dvd', 'parents', 'should', 'get', 'kids', 'shelves', 'cause', 'hilarious', 'easy', 'watch', 'wish', 'have', 'sequel', 'one', 'day', 'great', 'nagging', 'part', 'regress', 'movie', '98', '%', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'book', 'can', 'stand', 'alone', 'original', 'movie', 'just', 'not', 'same', 'book', ""'ve"", 'read']",N/A

You get Ella Enchanted, Miramax's newest gem of a film, narrated by Eric Idle and starring the lovely Anne Hathaway and the dreamy Hugh Dancy.Ella of Frell (Anne Hathaway) has a gift.  Er, I mean, a curse.  A gift, a curse, it all depends on how you look at it: no matter what you tell Ella to do, she must obey.  A rather capricious fairy named Lucinda (Vivica A. Fox) gave baby Ella the ""gift of obedience"": anything spoken to Ella as a command, she must automatically do.  Fast forward a few years: Ella is now a young lady, and no one except her aunt Mandy (Minnie Driver) knows about this gift/curse.  Not even her best friend and fellow civil rights activist Arieda (played by ""Bend It Like Beckham's"" Parminder K. Nagra) is aware of her ""problem.""  When her father brings home a wicked new stepmother (Joanna Lumley) and two evil stepsisters, Hattie (Lucy Punch) and Olive (Jennifer Higham), Ella must deal with their demanding ways, hopefully without giving away her secret!Her stepsister Hattie is the very obsessive and very active president of the Prince Charmont fan club!  She and her friends go absolutely ga-ga, every time they even think of the hunky prince (much less when they see him).  Prince ""Char"" (Hugh Dancy) as they lovingly call him, is the heir apparent to the throne currently held for him by his evil uncle Edgar (Cary Elwes).  The coronation day coming soon, and the kingdom in a bit of upheavel due to the heavy handed rule of Edgar, ogres, giants, and elves alike are all ready for a change!  But will everyone accept Prince Charmont as their new king?One magical day when Ella and Prince Charmont cross paths, it is love at first sight for Prince Char. But the feisty and proud Ella is not so quick to fall for the prince; she is sure he is as unfeeling and uncaring as his uncle is.  And since Ella actively fights for ogres' rights, along with any other magical creature in her kingdom (giants, elves, etc.), she wants nothing to do with the handsome Char.  But when their paths keep crossing again and again...what's a girl to do!?!And so Ella of Frell sets out to find her fairy godmother Lucinda, to ask her to take back her ""gift"" of obedience, armed with Mandy's boyfriend book named Benny (who can picture anyone, anywhere) and elf pal Slannen, they encounter much along the way (including Prince Char!).  They reach the land of the giants only to discover that Lucinda has already left, and Ella is forced by her obedience gift to stay and sing for the giants (her rendition of ""Someone to Love,"" is entertaining and very well done!).  But when Ella is finally commanded to do something that tests her very will...can she find Lucinda in time?  Will she end up doing something she will forever regret?Content:  This film had very little objectionable content: there were a few general references that would be above most children's heads, very little language (a few words), and only some mild violence.  Given a PG rating: ""For some crude language and violence.""  A young girl (with some help) defeats ogres and fights various magical creatures, giants are shown slaving in a field, someone is ""poisoned,"" and a giant falls in love with an elf.A high energy family-friendly film that reminds you again, why every girl waits for her prince and wishes for that happily ever after (but has some serious fun in the process!).  The modern day references did not detract from the story at all, but added a bit of fun and light-hearted teasing to an entertaining movie.  I laughed and laughed at the sometimes silly and sometimes serious jokes that poked fun at various modern day places and things.  One particular moment that caused a huge laugh: Ella and Arieda are leaving a building and travel down a ""medieval escalator"" (a wooden set of moving stairs, with a giant wheel turned by servants).

614516,A4FX5YCJA630V,B00005JM5Q,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[51, 67]","You'd think after the success of the ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Harry Potter"" movies, producers and writers would be getting a message loud and clear: that the more loyal a movie is to its original source material, the happier fans will be. As it is, I'm detecting a trend in the reviews written for the big screen version of ""Ella Enchanted"" - those that have never read the book find it sweet and charming, but those that are fans of Gail Carson Levine's wonderful novel are wondering what went wrong.Levine's novel is a reworking of the Cinderella story, who comes up with a legitimate reason as to why Cinderella would allow herself to be bullied around so much by her stepfamily. Levine's ingenius idea is that Ella has been placed under a gift/curse by her fairy godmother Lucinda, which forces her to to whatever she's told.Well, this is about the only plot device that the screen-writers chose to keep, and even then it's twisted into something that's virtually unrecognisable. In the book, Ella's curse has a rather dark side to it - should she fail to obey a command, she is overcome with nausea and pain until she does so. In the movie however, this potent imagery is replaced with little twinkling lights about her head and a little jolt from the actress that implies the curse triggers her like a button would control a robot.The second component of Levine's story that the screenwriters keep but inexorably twist out of shape is the love story between Ella and Prince Charmont. Here, they instigate not one, but two of the oldest and most cliched ""love devices"" known to cinematic history - love at first sight, and hate at first sight. For Prince Char, it takes only a glance for him to know that Ella's the girl for him. For Ella, it's the beginning of a prickly relationship that sees her eventually mellow out and fall in love. In the book however, Levine instigates a revolutionary idea in terms of fairytale-falling-in-love: that the two romantic leads could actually become *friends* before they become lovers! Believe it or not, Levine's story has Ella and Char meeting several times before they wed, joking around, exchanging letters, even *talking* and getting to know each others personalities before they declare their love! Unheard of!And so, with the only two original Levine-ideas in the movie corrupted beyond all recognition, the script-writers turn to other ideas to exploit the beloved book: introducing characters and situations that never existed in Levine's story. So we have a regent-uncle that wants to kill his nephew before his coronation (why not do this whilst Char was a child?), an irritating elf that wants to be a lawyer, and a talking holographic book. The original characters are brought to lackluster life by Parminder K. Nagra as a 30+ year old Arieda, Minnie Driver as an underused Mandy, Joanna Lumley as Olga, and Vivica A. Fox as a black Lucinda (there is such a thing as taking political correctness too far).Hugh Dancy and Anne Hathaway (who possibly has the world's largest smile) are amiable enough leads, but pale in comparison to Levine's characterisations. For Ella in particular, whose one passion in life was to remove the hated curse from her, it was her journey of self discovery that made up most of the book - the love story was a sub-plot. Although Char was a fundamental part of her finally destroying the curse, it was always clear that rather than finding romance, Ella finds *herself*. In the movie however, the love story (and a stupid pro-active protesting message) is Ella's motivation, not her reward.Often the movie seems to be blantantly (and painfully) ripping off the popularity of ""Shrek"" and ""The Princess Bride"", as well as a little dose of ""A Knight's Tale"" with the inclusion of characters bursting into modern songs. It didn't work completely in ""A Knight's Tale"", but at least they had the advantage of being original.The visuals come across as tacky and garish, (why not the ornate but realistic look of ""Ever After?"") and don't even get me started on the cheesy bluescreen special effects. The modernised elements are painful to behold - ""Ye Olde Shopping Mall""?! and the script is ripe with cringe-worthy phrases such as ""We've got a coronation to crash!"", ""You're not like other girls,"" and ""Cool!"" Also, let it be known to movie-makers everywhere that spoofs of the ""Matrix"" fights have been done to death. It's just not funny anymore. I promise.In any adapted movie, at least *some* respect should be given for the source material.

614517,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00005JM5Q,Robert Moore,"[3, 3]","Harvard philosopher Stanley Cavell in his book on cinema THE WORLD VIEWED states early on that people who truly love film tend to love most film, rather than less.  I suppose I'm one of those.  I won't say that I absolutely loved this film, and I wouldn't say that it is one of the best I've seen, but I thought it was a lot of fun, and one that I could definitely have enjoyed back in the days when I was taking my daughter to ""kids"" films.A friend talked me into seeing this after I had an absolutely awful experience seeing Anne Hathaway's newest film at a preview, THE PRINCESS DIARIES 2, which instantly went on my list of the worst films I have ever seen (with its willingness to put the crassest adolescent fantasies onscreen, its refusal to engage the politics implied in every scene, and its catering to the crassest materialism, I thought it should be classified as kiddie porn, i.e., porn for girls).  Despite the wretchedness of the film, I found myself liking Anne Hathaway.  She has a lovely and open face with huge eyes and very pleasant demeanor, and I compassionately kept wishing she weren't in that other film.  My friend assured me that ELLA ENCHANTED was as delightful as THE PRINCESS DIARIES 2 was not, and while I am not quite as certain that this was as good as the other was bad (the other was quite bad indeed), I did have an enchanting time.The central conceit of the film is that a girl living ""once upon a time"" in a magical land is given the ""gift"" at birth of strict obedience to anyone who tells her to do anything.  The trouble is, Ella isn't by nature a submissive, demure creature.  She is spirited and feisty and has ideas about the world that are her own.  I needn't belabor the plot, except to say that Ella decides that she doesn't want to be enchanted any longer, and goes off to seek her fairy godmother, the one who gave her the gift and the only one capable of removing it.  Of course, her being forced to obey any command leads to a host of situations, including being ordered by giants (of the gentle variety) to sing, upon which she does an entertaining version of ""Somebody to Love,"" the Queen one, not the Jefferson Airplane.There is a surprisingly strong cast, though much of it is underutilized.  The evil king is played by Cary Elwes, who starred in arguably the finest Hollywood example of the fairy tale genre, the splendid THE PRINCESS BRIDE (the finest example from any source was Jean Cocteau's surreally exquisite BEAUTY AND THE BEAST).  Minnie Driver plays Ella's aunt, but she barely appears in the film.  The same is true of the always delightful Joanna Lumley and Eric Idle, the latter primarily serving as narrator.  Vivaca Fox plays Lucinda, Ella's fairy godmother, but like the others spends very little time onscreen.I loved the look of the film, very bright, very lovely, and sufficiently magical.  But mainly I liked Anne Hathaway.  From time to time you see someone you feel must be marked for something special.  With her extraordinary face and onscreen appeal, I think she is as close to a ""can't miss"" as comes along.  That is, as long as she can find the right roles.  I think she can do better than ELLA ENCHANTED.  The challenge will be keeping her from more films like THE PRINCESS DIARIES 2.",4,"Primarily for kids, but fun for adults as well",1093564800,"08 27, 2004",2004,3267,"['Harvard', 'Stanley', 'Cavell', 'book', 'cinema', 'THE', 'WORLD', 'VIEWED', 'early', 'people', 'who', 'truly', 'love', 'film', 'tend', 'love', 'most', 'film', 'rather', 'less', 'suppose', ""'m"", 'one', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'one', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'thought', 'was', 'lot', 'fun', 'one', 'could', 'definitely', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'back', 'days', 'when', 'was', 'taking', 'daughter', 'kids', 'films.A', 'friend', 'talked', 'seeing', 'had', 'absolutely', 'awful', 'experience', 'seeing', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'newest', 'film', 'preview', 'THE', 'PRINCESS', 'DIARIES', '2', 'instantly', 'went', 'list', 'worst', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'willingness', 'put', 'crassest', 'adolescent', 'fantasies', 'onscreen', 'refusal', 'engage', 'politics', 'implied', 'scene', 'catering', 'crassest', 'materialism', 'thought', 'should', 'be', 'classified', 'kiddie', 'porn', 'i.e.', 'porn', 'girls', 'wretchedness', 'film', 'found', 'liking', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'lovely', 'open', 'face', 'huge', 'eyes', 'very', 'pleasant', 'demeanor', 'compassionately', 'kept', 'wishing', 'were', ""n't"", 'other', 'film', 'friend', 'assured', 'ELLA', 'ENCHANTED', 'was', 'as', 'delightful', 'THE', 'PRINCESS', 'DIARIES', '2', 'was', 'not', 'am', 'not', 'quite', 'certain', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'other', 'was', 'bad', 'other', 'was', 'quite', 'bad', 'indeed', 'did', 'have', 'enchanting', 'time.The', 'central', 'conceit', 'film', 'girl', 'living', 'once', 'time', 'magical', 'land', 'given', 'gift', 'birth', 'strict', 'obedience', 'anyone', 'who', 'do', 'anything', 'trouble', 'Ella', ""n't"", 'nature', 'submissive', 'demure', 'creature', 'spirited', 'feisty', 'ideas', 'world', 'are', 'own', 'need', ""n't"", 'belabor', 'plot', 'say', 'Ella', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'enchanted', 'longer', 'off', 'seek', 'fairy', 'godmother', 'one', 'who', 'gave', 'gift', 'only', 'one', 'capable', 'removing', 'course', 'being', 'forced', 'obey', 'command', 'host', 'situations', 'including', 'being', 'ordered', 'giants', 'gentle', 'variety', 'sing', 'entertaining', 'version', 'Somebody', 'Love', 'Queen', 'one', 'not', 'Jefferson', 'Airplane.There', 'surprisingly', 'strong', 'cast', 'though', 'much', 'underutilized', 'evil', 'king', 'played', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'who', 'starred', 'arguably', 'finest', 'Hollywood', 'example', 'fairy', 'tale', 'genre', 'splendid', 'THE', 'PRINCESS', 'BRIDE', 'finest', 'example', 'source', 'was', 'Jean', 'Cocteau', 'surreally', 'exquisite', 'BEAUTY', 'THE', 'BEAST', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'Ella', 'aunt', 'barely', 'film', 'same', 'true', 'always', 'delightful', 'Joanna', 'Lumley', 'Eric', 'Idle', 'latter', 'primarily', 'serving', 'narrator', 'Vivaca', 'Fox', 'Lucinda', 'Ella', 'fairy', 'godmother', 'others', 'very', 'little', 'time', 'loved', 'look', 'film', 'very', 'bright', 'very', 'lovely', 'sufficiently', 'magical', 'mainly', 'liked', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'time', 'time', 'see', 'someone', 'feel', 'must', 'be', 'marked', 'something', 'special', 'extraordinary', 'face', 'onscreen', 'appeal', 'think', 'as', 'close', 'ca', ""n't"", 'miss', 'along', 'as', 'long', 'can', 'find', 'right', 'roles', 'think', 'can', 'do', 'better', 'ELLA', 'ENCHANTED', 'challenge', 'will', 'be', 'keeping', 'more', 'films', 'THE', 'PRINCESS', 'DIARIES', '2']",N/A

614522,A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB,B00005JM5Q,"Sarah ""Eat Dessert First""","[0, 1]","Ella Enchanted, based upon the novel by Gail Carson Levine and screenplay by Laurie Craig, is the Cinderella tale of Ella of Frell (Anne Hathaway,The Princess Diaries (Special Edition)), a girl cursed by wayward fairy Lucinda (Vivica A. Fox) with the ""gift"" of obedience. Ella must obey every command given her, which puts her at increasing risk as her stepsisters quickly deduce and exploit her vulnerability. Ella runs into Prince Charmant (Hugh Dancy,Blood & Chocolate), and goes on a quest to help several magical creatures and to find Lucinda and make her remove the curse.The CGI elements felt outdated, more on par with a made-for-TV special than a feature film (of course, afterThe Shrek Trilogy (Shrek / Shrek 2 / Shrek the Third) (Full Screen Edition)raised the bar, it takes a lot to compete). The CGI snake kept reminding me of Sir Hiss inRobin Hood (Most Wanted Edition), with less charm. The odd visual mashup of CGI and sets felt jarring. The humor and visual gags felt lowbrow and flat.The film had a promising premise and a strong cast, including Anne Hathaway, Vivica Fox, Cary Elwes (a far cry here from his breakout role inThe Princess Bride (20th Anniversary Edition)), and Eric Idle, but the film feels like it's pulling in several directions and can't make up its mind. At times, it tries to please preteens with the dreamy Prince Charmant and magical creatures. There are also dashes of adult humor thrown in, notably several Monty Python references. Several song-and-dance numbers also flit in and out, as do chases and action sequences. The musical numbers felt flat, including Darren Hayes' Strange Magic, played over the opening credits.Overall, this was an adaptation where too many cooks spoiled the broth. Ella Enchanted wanted to be a hip, happening update on Fractured Fairytales like Shrek and The Princess Bride, but doesn't have a clear picture of what it wants to be or where it wants to go. This may amuse young viewers, but for older kids and teens, there are numerous fairy tale updates that are far more entertaining.",2,Too many cooks spoil the broth,1205366400,"03 13, 2008",2008,2058,"['Ella', 'Enchanted', 'based', 'novel', 'Gail', 'Carson', 'Levine', 'screenplay', 'Laurie', 'Craig', 'Cinderella', 'tale', 'Ella', 'Frell', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'Princess', 'Diaries', 'Special', 'Edition', 'girl', 'cursed', 'wayward', 'fairy', 'Lucinda', 'Vivica', 'A', 'Fox', 'gift', 'obedience', 'Ella', 'must', 'obey', 'command', 'given', 'increasing', 'risk', 'stepsisters', 'quickly', 'deduce', 'exploit', 'vulnerability', 'Ella', 'Prince', 'Charmant', 'Hugh', 'Dancy', 'Blood', 'Chocolate', 'quest', 'help', 'several', 'magical', 'creatures', 'find', 'Lucinda', 'make', 'remove', 'curse.The', 'CGI', 'elements', 'felt', 'outdated', 'more', 'par', 'made-for-TV', 'special', 'feature', 'film', 'course', 'afterThe', 'Shrek', 'Trilogy', 'Shrek', '/', 'Shrek', '2', '/', 'Shrek', 'Third', 'Full', 'Screen', 'Edition', 'raised', 'bar', 'lot', 'compete', 'CGI', 'snake', 'kept', 'reminding', 'Sir', 'Hiss', 'inRobin', 'Hood', 'Most', 'Wanted', 'Edition', 'less', 'charm', 'odd', 'visual', 'mashup', 'CGI', 'sets', 'felt', 'jarring', 'humor', 'visual', 'gags', 'felt', 'lowbrow', 'flat.The', 'film', 'had', 'promising', 'premise', 'strong', 'cast', 'including', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'Vivica', 'Fox', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'far', 'cry', 'here', 'breakout', 'role', 'inThe', 'Princess', 'Bride', '20th', 'Anniversary', 'Edition', 'Eric', 'Idle', 'film', 'feels', 'pulling', 'several', 'directions', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'times', 'please', 'preteens', 'dreamy', 'Prince', 'Charmant', 'magical', 'creatures', 'are', 'also', 'dashes', 'adult', 'humor', 'thrown', 'notably', 'several', 'Monty', 'Python', 'references', 'Several', 'song-and-dance', 'numbers', 'also', 'flit', 'out', 'do', 'chases', 'action', 'sequences', 'musical', 'numbers', 'felt', 'flat', 'including', 'Darren', 'Hayes', 'Strange', 'Magic', 'played', 'opening', 'credits.Overall', 'was', 'adaptation', 'where', 'too', 'many', 'cooks', 'spoiled', 'broth', 'Ella', 'Enchanted', 'wanted', 'be', 'hip', 'happening', 'update', 'Fractured', 'Fairytales', 'Shrek', 'Princess', 'Bride', ""n't"", 'have', 'clear', 'picture', 'what', 'be', 'where', 'go', 'may', 'amuse', 'young', 'viewers', 'older', 'kids', 'teens', 'are', 'numerous', 'fairy', 'tale', 'updates', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'entertaining']",N/A

Yes, there were some differences with the book, like other book-based movies, but it lacked of 'energy' that filled the story from book. The fairies seemed flat, the unicorn just appeared out of nowhere in the first title song (though I don't remember any unicorns in original story), the prince (oh, yes, he was quite charming) seemed not having any serious thoughts of his own.Perhaps if the ending wasn't that far different, it would be nicer.

While I imagine it probably goes ever very well with that audience (I don't know for sure; I'm not now nor was I ever a six-to-twelve year-old girl) I can say that its appeal is most definately not limited to one particular audience.  This is fantastic fun no matter your age or gender.  What the ""Lord Of The Rings"" movies are to the genre of epic fantasy novels, ""Ella Enchanted"" is to the classic fairy-tale genre, albeit with a bit of more modern allegory and contemporary-world-derived humor added in.  These additions don't detract from the fairy tale appeal; they just make ""Ella Enchanted"" an even better movie.Everything form the colors of the world to the rolling green landscapes to the everyday mannerisms of the characters make it clear that we're in a different world, one of great whimsey and fantasy, where realism can be joyously brushed aside for a while.  The title character Ella (charmingly played by Anne Hathaway) was 'gifted' at birth with an unusual charm from her fairy godmother (in this world all newborn children get them from their respective fairy godmothers) - the gift of obediance.  Thus susceptible to being anyone's pawn, Ella has to carefully hide this gift all her life until one day it's discovered by - in perfect fairytale fashion - her newly arrived wicked stepsisters, just in time to play havoc with Ella's budding new romance.Quite aside from the fantasy elements, this is one of the best comedies I've seen in years, one of relatively few laugh-out-loud comedies I've recently encountered.  ""Lilo & Stitch"" was like that too - it's getting so there are almost more great comedies in the Family section of the video store than the Comedy section itself.  A lot of the comedy comes from a great, over-the-top turn as the lead villain by Cary Elwes.If you love classic Disney like ""Beauty And The Beast"" and ""Cinderella"" complete with the singing mice and dancing teacups (those aren't here, but they're an example of the Kind of element that usually gets omitted when a Disney-esque tale makes the transition from animation to live action, but is present here); if you love anime along the lines of the wonderous ""Kiki's Delivery Service"", if you love the superb ""Fairy Tale: A True Story"" (less 'out there' and more of a realworld setting for the story than ""Ella"") or if you love the glorious romance of ""Serendipity"" but would also like something the little ones can watch along with you, go for this unique and adventurous fantasy comedy.

It also uses the fantasy setting as a lens to provide some minor social and political commentary, but more for fun than to preach.

614532,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B00005JM5Q,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[2, 2]","A delightful and charming romantic/fantasy/comedy, ""Ella Enchanted"" echoes ""Shrek"" and ""The Princess Bride"" in a clever fairytale about Ella (Anne Hathaway) who is given the gift of obedience by a goofy fairy godmother (Vivica A. Fox). So, for her whole life Ella must do what others tell her which can lead to some unexpected complications for example her mother instructs her daughter to ""dig in"" on her birthday and she proceeds to stuff her face with cake using her hands. When Ella's mother dies her father Sir Peter (Patrick Bergin) remarries and suddenly she has a wicked step mother (Joanna Lumley) and two manipulative wicked step-sisters. Ella decides that she must find the fairy godmother that gave her gift and ask her to take it back. Along the way she meets and falls in love with Prince Charmont (Hugh Dancy), ogres, fairies and giants. When Charmont realizes he loves Ella as well, his evil uncle Edgar (the delightful Cary Elwes) uses Ella for a wicked plan. Featuring great performances of songs performed by ELO, Queen, Katrina & The Waves and others, ""Ella Enchanted"" captures much of the spirit of ""Shrek"" without copying it.The widescreen anamorphic transfer looks spectacular with rich storybook colors and fairytale blue skies. There's some minor edge enhancement but, on the whole, the film looks marvelous. The sound comes across with tremendous presence. Since many popular songs from the 70's and 80's are integrated into song and dance numbers in the movie, the carefully blended sound and the 5.1 mix become almost as important as the image.Two featurettes are included on this disc. The first is a nice glimpse behind the scenes of the making of the movie. The ""Red Carpet Premiere Special"" was originally telecast on the Disney Channel. It's nothing special but fans of Anne Hathaway will want to watch it to get a glimpse of her looking radiant at the movie premiere. There are also deleted and extended scenes, a music video performed by Kari Kimmel and ""Prince Charmont's Fan Club"" game. Watching the deleted scenes it's clear that many of these scenes would have worked in the final film, it's just that they were cut for time constraints or pacing.  It provides a clever variation on a running joke throughout the movie regarding the prince. We also get the ""Happily Ever After"" DVD-ROM feature which I couldn't quite get to work correctly.It seems a fun time was had by all in the making of this movie. A fun, informative commentary by the attractive stars of the film Hugh Dancy and Anne Hathaway with their director Tommy O'Haven. Both O'Haven and Dancy also provide commentary for the deleted scenes.A delightful film filled with magical, funny moments and dancing Ogres, ""Ella Enchanted"" manages to channel the spirit of ""Shrek"" in a live action movie. The brisk direction, witty script and deft performances make this a delightful movie for all ages despite the PG rating. By the way, the PG is for some crude humor but nothing your kids probably haven't already heard or seen in their school (or ""Shrek"" and ""Shrek 2"" for that matter).",4,Witty family romantic comedy mixed with fantasy,1094342400,"09 5, 2004",2004,3080,"['delightful', 'charming', 'romantic/fantasy/comedy', 'Ella', 'Enchanted', 'Shrek', 'Princess', 'Bride', 'clever', 'fairytale', 'Ella', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'who', 'given', 'gift', 'obedience', 'goofy', 'fairy', 'godmother', 'Vivica', 'A', 'Fox', 'So', 'whole', 'life', 'Ella', 'must', 'do', 'what', 'others', 'tell', 'can', 'lead', 'unexpected', 'complications', 'example', 'mother', 'daughter', 'dig', 'birthday', 'stuff', 'face', 'cake', 'using', 'hands', 'When', 'Ella', 'mother', 'father', 'Sir', 'Peter', 'Patrick', 'Bergin', 'remarries', 'suddenly', 'wicked', 'step', 'mother', 'Joanna', 'Lumley', 'two', 'manipulative', 'wicked', 'step-sisters', 'Ella', 'must', 'find', 'fairy', 'godmother', 'gave', 'gift', 'ask', 'take', 'back', 'way', 'love', 'Prince', 'Charmont', 'Hugh', 'Dancy', 'fairies', 'giants', 'When', 'Charmont', 'Ella', 'as', 'well', 'evil', 'uncle', 'Edgar', 'delightful', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'Ella', 'wicked', 'plan', 'Featuring', 'great', 'performances', 'songs', 'performed', 'ELO', 'Queen', 'Katrina', 'Waves', 'others', 'Ella', 'Enchanted', 'much', 'spirit', 'Shrek', 'copying', 'it.The', 'widescreen', 'anamorphic', 'transfer', 'spectacular', 'rich', 'storybook', 'colors', 'fairytale', 'blue', 'skies', 'minor', 'edge', 'enhancement', 'whole', 'film', 'marvelous', 'sound', 'tremendous', 'presence', 'many', 'popular', 'songs', '70', '80', 'are', 'integrated', 'song', 'dance', 'numbers', 'movie', 'carefully', 'blended', 'sound', '5.1', 'mix', 'become', 'almost', 'as', 'important', 'image.Two', 'featurettes', 'are', 'included', 'disc', 'first', 'nice', 'glimpse', 'scenes', 'making', 'movie', 'Red', 'Carpet', 'Premiere', 'Special', 'was', 'originally', 'telecast', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'nothing', 'special', 'fans', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'will', 'want', 'watch', 'get', 'glimpse', 'looking', 'radiant', 'movie', 'premiere', 'are', 'also', 'deleted', 'extended', 'scenes', 'music', 'video', 'performed', 'Kari', 'Kimmel', 'Prince', 'Charmont', 'Fan', 'Club', 'game', 'Watching', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'clear', 'many', 'scenes', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'final', 'film', 'just', 'were', 'cut', 'time', 'constraints', 'pacing', 'clever', 'variation', 'running', 'joke', 'movie', 'regarding', 'prince', 'also', 'get', 'Happily', 'Ever', 'DVD-ROM', 'feature', 'could', ""n't"", 'quite', 'get', 'work', 'correctly.It', 'fun', 'time', 'was', 'had', 'making', 'movie', 'fun', 'informative', 'commentary', 'attractive', 'stars', 'film', 'Hugh', 'Dancy', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'director', 'Tommy', ""O'Haven"", 'Both', ""O'Haven"", 'Dancy', 'also', 'provide', 'commentary', 'deleted', 'scenes.A', 'delightful', 'film', 'filled', 'magical', 'funny', 'moments', 'dancing', 'Ogres', 'Ella', 'Enchanted', 'channel', 'spirit', 'Shrek', 'live', 'action', 'movie', 'brisk', 'direction', 'witty', 'script', 'deft', 'performances', 'make', 'delightful', 'movie', 'ages', 'PG', 'rating', 'way', 'PG', 'crude', 'humor', 'nothing', 'kids', 'probably', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'heard', 'seen', 'school', 'Shrek', 'Shrek', '2', 'matter']",N/A
