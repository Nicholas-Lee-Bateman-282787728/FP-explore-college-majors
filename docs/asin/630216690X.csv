This was actually the pilot episode, directed by Texas Chanisaw Massacre director Tobe Hooper.This series actually went more for the horror than the comedy we were used to from the Nightmare movies. I always liked the feel of the series because it had a very eerie feel to it. While I never caught this episode in its days on television, I looked forward to seeing it.&quot;No More Mr. Nice Guy&quot; shows the supposed origin of Freddy Krueger. He is a child murderer, found not guilty, due to the police forgetting to read him his rights. He eventually returns to terrorize the children in their sleep. This episode contradicts a lot of what has been explained about Krueger in the film series but is still worth adding to your collection if you are a die-hard Nightmare On Elm Street fan.",3,The old &quot;Freddy's Nightmares&quot; series pilot,1059782400,"08 2, 2003",2003,920,"['When', 'came', 'time', 'ago', 'took', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'remember', 'when', 'was', 'series', 'FOX-25', 'back', 'day', 'was', 'actually', 'pilot', 'episode', 'directed', 'Texas', 'Chanisaw', 'Massacre', 'director', 'Tobe', 'Hooper.This', 'series', 'actually', 'went', 'more', 'horror', 'comedy', 'were', 'used', 'Nightmare', 'movies', 'always', 'liked', 'feel', 'series', 'had', 'very', 'eerie', 'feel', 'never', 'caught', 'episode', 'days', 'television', 'looked', 'forward', 'seeing', 'it.', 'quot', 'More', 'Mr.', 'Nice', 'Guy', 'quot', 'supposed', 'origin', 'Freddy', 'Krueger', 'child', 'murderer', 'found', 'not', 'guilty', 'due', 'police', 'forgetting', 'read', 'rights', 'eventually', 'terrorize', 'children', 'sleep', 'episode', 'lot', 'what', 'been', 'explained', 'Krueger', 'film', 'series', 'still', 'worth', 'adding', 'collection', 'are', 'die-hard', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'fan']",N/A

Ok, the story doesn't quite follow the movies, but how many different conflicting things have the fans seen by now?  I really enjoyed this telling of the story to show how Fred became the dream killer we all grew to love in the &quot;Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; movies.  I will say that the acting definitely is not award winning, although I think Robert Englund(Freddy Krueger) does a great job as usual.  The story is good enough if you are a fan you will most likely really get a kick out of it.  Now let's keep our fingers crossed that Robert Englund can get the Freddy Prequel movie up and rolling in another year or two.Keep the faith.",4,Treat for Nightmare Fans,1072656000,"12 29, 2003",2003,772,"['got', 'Christmas', 'friend', 'had', 'watch', 'very', 'night', 'can', 'definitely', 'tell', '80', 'story', ""n't"", 'quite', 'follow', 'movies', 'how', 'many', 'different', 'conflicting', 'things', 'have', 'fans', 'seen', 'now', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'telling', 'story', 'show', 'how', 'Fred', 'became', 'dream', 'killer', 'grew', 'love', 'quot', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'quot', 'movies', 'will', 'say', 'acting', 'definitely', 'not', 'award', 'winning', 'think', 'Robert', 'Englund', 'Freddy', 'Krueger', 'great', 'job', 'usual', 'story', 'good', 'enough', 'are', 'fan', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'really', 'get', 'kick', 'Now', 'let', 'keep', 'fingers', 'crossed', 'Robert', 'Englund', 'can', 'get', 'Freddy', 'Prequel', 'movie', 'up', 'rolling', 'year', 'two.Keep', 'faith']",N/A
