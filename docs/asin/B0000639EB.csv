He walks by an open market and a small amusement park. [His lack of a hat show changing styles.] He thinks of Paris after its liberation, people celebrated in the streets and at home. Helen was expelled from her university. The talk is about money. Wills is from Milwaukee. What will he do after the war has ended? He is a journalist. They sing &#8220;La Marseillaise&#8221; (a song from the French Revolution). Wills becomes friendly with Helen (she spent the war in Switzerland). Wills brings a box of groceries. A hot tip on a horse race? Charles is warned against this. That horse wins! Was it intuition or a fix? Betting on the end of the war? Helen is in the hospital - the flu. More talk about money. &#8220;You don&#8217;t need money to have fun in Paris.&#8221; [Believable?] What will make Helen happy? Marianne also.Helen has gained weight, she is no longer a size ten. Claude was appointed as Prosecutor. Charles types an article. Time passes. Charles&#8217; book is rejected. There is a New Year&#8217;s celebration. Is mediocrity the key to a successful novel? [Know our audience?] Helen Wills jumped into a fountain and was arrested. Did she want to get into print? They visit a bistro. An artist paints a portrait of Helen at a fountain. Her daughter Vickie dances en pointe. Charles will interview a woman, Mrs. Quale. She has been divorced four times before. [Is she a danger?] Charles meets Claude and his wife Marion when leaving the bistro. A telephone call brings news of an oil strike on their lands. Can it be $50,000 a year? [The prices date this picture, the minimum wage was 75 cents an hour then.] They go on a spending spree. But Charles remains in his room. His novels are rejected. Was his life wasted? Charles loses money arm-wrestling. [Can an office worker match a manual laborer?]Charles continues his typing, he is starting over. [His hands are hidden to simulate typing.] Vickie has lost a front tooth. They meet a &#8220;tennis bum&#8221;. There is a party. Is Charles drinking too much? Helen wants to go home, leaving the party early. [Do people talk about an absent guest?] Is their life in Paris boring? A car race pads out the story. There is a crash in the rain! [Do you see a problem developing?] There is personal conflict. Helen spends time with Paul. [Is it her looks or her money?] &#8220;Its done all the time.&#8221; [Note the roads in winter.]Helen walks in the rain to her sister&#8217;s home. &#8220;Take care of Vickie.&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;ll always love you.&#8221; Charles mourns Helen. Later he meets Vickie. [Note her hairdo.] Charles wants Vickie back, so does Vickie. Things have changed, he didn&#8217;t recognize anyone at the Dingo bar in the afternoon. Charles is writing short stories now. Marion refuses to let Vickie leave. [What would you do?] She hates Charles, Claude explains why. [A psychologist?] Could Charles be reunited with his daughter for a happy ending?I wonder if a popular song was used as a vehicle for this story? Is this a warning about the idle rich who live in a foreign country? I never read the story by F. Scott Fitzgerald (and never will).

693986,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0000639EB,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","With some strong performances (Taylor, Pidgeon and Johnson were all Oscar worthy), a two-hanky level storyline (yes, there will be tears) and an effervescent atmosphere created by the otherworldly Paris, `The Last Time I Saw Paris' is a wonderful film that will captivate from start to finish.The film revolves around a young GI named Charles Wills who happens across a family with two daughters, both ripe for the picking and yet it is the vivacious Helen who steals his heart, much to the disappointment of her sister Marion.  Charles is not rich, but he is handsome and charming and his heart is big enough to swallow Helen whole.  Soon they are married and embarking on a life of love and happiness and a beautiful daughter and eventual struggles and broken trust and mistakes and frustrations and heartbreak.  Yes, life is never easy, and Charles and Helen find that out that hard way when their marriage begins to fray at the seams.  Charles' endeavor to become a published author weighs a heavy burden on his soul as rejection continues to corrode his demeanor, and Helen finds herself lost in a freedom she can't control and her unhappiness bleeds into flirtatious affection-seeking around other men.  With the judgmental eyes of Marion lurking around their every move, and the drunken habits of Helen's father, James, rearing their head in the early morning hours, Charles and Helen completely fall to pieces.But there is no denying that they are in love.There are moments within `The Last Time I Saw Paris' that are obvious manipulations, but they are handled with care.  The opening section and the closing are brilliantly conceived, completely powerful and emotionally complex.  There are moments in the film's center that meander a little, and the time shifts are a tad drastic in parts.  Despite the flaws though, this is a really well done film that will grab you and keep you close.  Taylor is fantastic, delivering a `complete' performance.  She starts off carefree and exotic, using her body and her voice to tease the audience (as well as Charles), but as the marriage strain sets in her demeanor changes and she begins to harden.  The way she handles that shift is remarkable.  Even her line readings are spot on (""you far less beat up than you ought to be"").  And then, as she desperately tries to save her marriage you can feel that passion swell inside her; right down to the way she holds her husband's head against her face.  Walter Pidgeon is also great here, comedic gold (he hits every mark), and Donna Reed uses her facial expressions to superb effect.  To me though, this film is all about Van Johnson.  His portrayal of Charles is remarkable.  He bleeds with such emotional frustrations.  As his career collapses you can feel his despair and as he seeks refuge in the arms of a stranger you can feel the guilt rise in his throat.  His soliloquy alone was flawlessly executed (and this is from someone who loathes soliloquies).And that final act, with his daughter...just wow.As a whole, the film itself really needed a sharper hand in its center, but the acting alone is so breathtaking that it demands to be seen and lauded.",4,This won't be the last time I see this movie...,1318291200,"10 11, 2011",2011,3156,"['strong', 'performances', 'Taylor', 'Pidgeon', 'Johnson', 'were', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'two-hanky', 'level', 'storyline', 'yes', 'will', 'be', 'tears', 'effervescent', 'atmosphere', 'created', 'otherworldly', 'Paris', 'Last', 'Time', 'Saw', 'Paris', 'wonderful', 'film', 'will', 'captivate', 'start', 'finish.The', 'film', 'revolves', 'young', 'GI', 'named', 'Charles', 'Wills', 'who', 'family', 'two', 'daughters', 'ripe', 'picking', 'yet', 'vivacious', 'Helen', 'who', 'heart', 'much', 'disappointment', 'sister', 'Marion', 'Charles', 'not', 'rich', 'handsome', 'charming', 'heart', 'big', 'enough', 'swallow', 'Helen', 'whole', 'Soon', 'are', 'married', 'embarking', 'life', 'love', 'happiness', 'beautiful', 'daughter', 'eventual', 'struggles', 'broken', 'trust', 'mistakes', 'frustrations', 'heartbreak', 'Yes', 'life', 'never', 'easy', 'Charles', 'Helen', 'find', 'out', 'hard', 'way', 'when', 'marriage', 'fray', 'seams', 'Charles', 'endeavor', 'become', 'published', 'author', 'heavy', 'burden', 'soul', 'rejection', 'corrode', 'demeanor', 'Helen', 'lost', 'freedom', 'ca', ""n't"", 'control', 'unhappiness', 'bleeds', 'flirtatious', 'affection-seeking', 'other', 'men', 'judgmental', 'eyes', 'Marion', 'lurking', 'around', 'move', 'drunken', 'habits', 'Helen', 'father', 'James', 'rearing', 'head', 'early', 'morning', 'hours', 'Charles', 'Helen', 'completely', 'fall', 'pieces.But', 'denying', 'are', 'are', 'moments', 'Last', 'Time', 'Saw', 'Paris', 'are', 'obvious', 'manipulations', 'are', 'handled', 'care', 'opening', 'section', 'closing', 'are', 'brilliantly', 'conceived', 'completely', 'powerful', 'emotionally', 'complex', 'are', 'moments', 'film', 'center', 'little', 'time', 'shifts', 'are', 'tad', 'drastic', 'parts', 'flaws', 'really', 'well', 'done', 'film', 'will', 'grab', 'keep', 'close', 'Taylor', 'fantastic', 'delivering', 'complete', 'performance', 'carefree', 'exotic', 'using', 'body', 'voice', 'tease', 'audience', 'as', 'well', 'Charles', 'marriage', 'strain', 'sets', 'demeanor', 'changes', 'harden', 'way', 'shift', 'remarkable', 'Even', 'line', 'readings', 'are', 'spot', 'far', 'less', 'beat', 'up', 'ought', 'be', 'then', 'desperately', 'save', 'marriage', 'can', 'feel', 'passion', 'swell', 'right', 'way', 'husband', 'head', 'face', 'Walter', 'Pidgeon', 'also', 'great', 'here', 'comedic', 'gold', 'mark', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'facial', 'expressions', 'superb', 'effect', 'film', 'Van', 'Johnson', 'portrayal', 'Charles', 'remarkable', 'such', 'emotional', 'frustrations', 'career', 'can', 'feel', 'despair', 'refuge', 'arms', 'stranger', 'can', 'feel', 'guilt', 'rise', 'throat', 'soliloquy', 'alone', 'was', 'flawlessly', 'executed', 'someone', 'who', 'soliloquies', '.And', 'final', 'act', 'daughter', 'just', 'wow.As', 'whole', 'film', 'really', 'needed', 'sharper', 'hand', 'center', 'acting', 'alone', 'so', 'breathtaking', 'be', 'seen', 'lauded']",N/A
693987,A3K8POFWCQI2GS,B0000639EB,Char,"[0, 0]","The movie dates from 1954 and might be considered a classic by fans of these actors and of old movies in general, but I didn't find it very ""compelling.""  For some reason, I wasn't able to care about the story very much--until the end.The story begins as Americans in Paris are celebrating the end of WWII.  A love story begins in which two sisters like the same guy.  (This was the only movie in which I've ever liked Van Johnson fairly well myself.  His face had the appearance of a more sensitive character than usual; he seemed slenderer or somehow less characteristic of his appearance in other movies.)  The sisters move on into their two separate marriages and troubles.  The plot focuses on the frustration of this American ex-soldier who is unable to succeed as a writer.  He becomes alcoholic, commits adultery.  His wife is mortally wounded emotionally by his unfaithfulness.  (The story is based on F. Scott Fitzgerald's ""Babylon Revisited"" and the character of the writer must partly represent Fitzgerald himself and his wife and associates.)The theme music of the movie is beautiful and the viewer has the opportunity to hear ""The Last Time I saw Paris"" played and replayed, expressing a gamut of moods in the background.  The nostalgic mood of the movie felt over-emphasized to me.  Too often, the main character returns in memory to the little Parisian cafe where the mural of his beautiful Beloved is an aching, sentimental focal point.  (I think the film-makers evoked that ""Cafe Memory"" about 4 times altogether and I became tired of it.  The sense of nostalgia that it was supposed to generate turned to a sense of my own irritation at the repetition.  But, perhaps that dwelling upon a painful memory was symptomatic of this man's alcoholism.)Finally in the last minutes of the story which hold in the balance the fate of a child (whom I found likable and lovable), there is a turning point which resolves the frustrations of the persons remaining alive in this situation which has played out over a period of about 8 years.  A sense of redemption and peace through forgiveness is made possible for all who've been tormented by stand-offs and hard feelings, jealousy and unforgiveness.  While this denouement finally makes the movie blessedly worthwhile, it sure takes a long time to go through some ineffectual drama and finally get to the satisfaction of it.Elizabeth Taylor is exquisitely pretty in this movie, young and slender and looking her best.  But the movie-maker uses her as a clothes-horse.  The viewer can't help noticing that she is wearing one attractive different outfit after another  as the story moves from one scene to the next.  (I wondered, ""Would it be realistic that this character would have so many clothes?"")  I guess all the chic clothing was typical ""Hollywood"" in those days.  Viewers (especially women movie-goers) were still expecting to get a lot of inspiration from the costumes and fashions ""modeled"" by the ""Stars"".I saw a VHS version of the movie that had been colorized, but the color faded back into black and white a lot.  Oddly, in my memory I see the movie as being in black and white even though I do recall that there were colorized scenes and that they were pleasanter than the black and white ones.  I imagine that the colorized and more panoramic versions of the movie make the Parisian settings more attractive and enjoyable.",3,Over-nostalgia.

In the case of this sentimental 1950's drama, everyone seems to be in a different age calling for a different sensibility.F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote his short story ""Babylon Revisited"" as a look back on the Jazz Age he knew so well. Paramount was going to film it, but that never happened. Gregory Peck was set to star at one point, but that too didn't materialize. When MGM got ahold of the rights to the story, the studio bosses decided to skip the 1920's in favor of the post-World War II period up to then-present day, says the new book ""Tough as Nails: The Life and Films of Richard Brooks"" (available from amazon.com).To that end, writer-director Richard Brooks took a solid screenplay by the Epstein twins (the guys who helped make ""Casablanca"" a classic) and updated it per studio demands.""The Last Time I Saw Paris"" isn't a bad movie - Elizabeth Taylor, Van Johnson, Walter Pidgeon and Donna Reed headline - but their characters seem trapped in a pre-Depression Paris mindset rather than the postwar period around them. One good outcome: Elizabeth Taylor later said this ""not so good picture"" helped her to realize she wanted to be an actress and would have to work at it.Brooks got something out of the experience, too. He realized he needed to get out of MGM if he wanted to do movies his way - writing them and directing them the way he felt they should be done. Such independence would come only by getting out of his contract or by directing a huge hit that would give him leverage at MGM for doing things his way. Fortunately for Brooks, he got that hit with his next movie, ""Blackboard Jungle.""Tough as Nails: The Life and Films of Richard Brooks (Wisconsin Film Studies)",3,A decent movie oddly out of time and place,1294185600,"01 5, 2011",2011,1785,"['Updating', 'story', 'present', 'day', 'sometimes', ""n't"", 'work', 'even', 'top', 'stars', 'production', 'values', 'case', 'sentimental', '1950', 'drama', 'everyone', 'be', 'different', 'age', 'calling', 'different', 'sensibility.F', 'Scott', 'Fitzgerald', 'wrote', 'short', 'story', 'Babylon', 'Revisited', 'look', 'back', 'Jazz', 'Age', 'knew', 'so', 'well', 'Paramount', 'was', 'going', 'film', 'never', 'happened', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'was', 'set', 'star', 'one', 'point', 'too', 'did', ""n't"", 'materialize', 'When', 'MGM', 'got', 'ahold', 'rights', 'story', 'studio', 'bosses', 'decided', 'skip', '1920', 'favor', 'post-World', 'War', 'II', 'period', 'up', 'then-present', 'day', 'new', 'book', 'Tough', 'Nails', 'Life', 'Films', 'Richard', 'Brooks', 'available', 'amazon.com', 'end', 'writer-director', 'Richard', 'Brooks', 'took', 'solid', 'screenplay', 'Epstein', 'twins', 'guys', 'who', 'helped', 'make', 'Casablanca', 'classic', 'updated', 'studio', 'demands', 'Last', 'Time', 'Saw', 'Paris', ""n't"", 'bad', 'movie', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'Van', 'Johnson', 'Walter', 'Pidgeon', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'headline', 'characters', 'seem', 'trapped', 'pre-Depression', 'Paris', 'mindset', 'rather', 'postwar', 'period', 'One', 'good', 'outcome', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'later', 'said', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'picture', 'helped', 'realize', 'wanted', 'be', 'actress', 'would', 'have', 'work', 'it.Brooks', 'got', 'something', 'experience', 'too', 'realized', 'needed', 'get', 'MGM', 'wanted', 'do', 'movies', 'way', 'writing', 'directing', 'way', 'felt', 'should', 'be', 'done', 'Such', 'independence', 'would', 'come', 'only', 'getting', 'contract', 'directing', 'huge', 'hit', 'would', 'give', 'leverage', 'MGM', 'doing', 'things', 'way', 'Fortunately', 'Brooks', 'got', 'hit', 'next', 'movie', 'Blackboard', 'Jungle', 'Tough', 'Nails', 'Life', 'Films', 'Richard', 'Brooks', 'Wisconsin', 'Film', 'Studies']",N/A

He meets two girls whom are sisters. Both fall in love with him although he is attracted the most beautiful women (Elizabeth Taylor). In her role she was totally dedicated to him and wanted nothing more in life than to be his wife. To have someone who loves you to that extreme is so rare and he abuses the relationship.

Interesting she dies and they have a kid who the other sister has possession and she (the other sister) is bitter because he didn't love her, etc... In the end he gets his daughter back.

There are a few others floating around that are VERY bad transfers. (The one in the Elizabeth Taylor boxed set is truly appalling in quality!)The release I mention above, while not absolutely perfect, is certainly very watchable.Now to the movie.Elizabeth Taylor never looked more beautiful, ...and she's gowned to perfection.One pale pink beaded ball gown looks like something Marie Antoinette might have worn, ....had she had money....!She gives a very believable performance here too, minus any whiny Southern accents.It's the material she's given which is at fault. The movie is unsure as to whether she's a tearaway free-spirit, ...or the dutiful wife and long-suffering mother.One minute she's being arrested for jumping into fountains, then we see her trying to salvage her husband's self esteem.This is probably more a fault in the screenplay's adaption from the original story than anything else.Walter Pigeon plays a sort of ageing rou&eacute;, ...perennially broke, fond of &#34;get-rich-quick&#34; schemes and always borrowing money, but charming in a roguish sort of way.I've never been a great fan of Van Johnson. He's perfectly adequate here, but I find him somewhat lacking in charisma as a romantic lead. Just how many damn freckles can anyone have on their forehead anyway?The Archive print certainly brings up the detail!He plays an F. Scott Fitzgerald sort of wannabee writer, (the aforementioned having written this story), and struggles to produce his first great novel, while flirting with alcoholism and marital infidelity along the way.A series of rejection slips sees him suffer psychological problems of self worth, and developing quite the careless approach to life. Fast cars and fast women, ...in the form of Eva Gabor become his escape.Gabor plays.....well herself really. (She's always between husbands here, just as in real life, and certainly not above borrowing somebody else's!)Watch for her disdain when she takes part in the Monte Carlo rally in an open topped sports car during a rainstorm!Frankly I could not fathom as to why Johnson would even be interested in Gabor's artifice, when he already had Elizabeth Taylor?Anyway, ....Johnson's character can't get it up as a writer and he descends in an almost suicidal spiral of booze and self-loathing.Donna Reed gets an unflattering role, ...the less attractive sister of Taylor. Reed has always so obviously been in love with Johnson, but he chooses to marry her more fascinating sister, while Reed is left to carry a long-burning torch, despite her marriage to another man.The curiosity of the movie is seeing a very young Roger Moore play a gigolo cum tennis player, long before James Bond was even mentioned.He's suitably &#34;gorgeous&#34;, but you just know he's a cad.Now as we all know so well, ....you simply cannot be an &#34;artist&#34;, or a &#34;writer&#34; unless you have SUFFERED. (Intentional capitals for emphasis!)We all realise that's why Johnson keeps getting those rejection slips! He's got it too good!He's got Liz for a start!Anyway, ...without giving away any spoilers, fate and his own death wish eventually takes care of that and voil&agrave;.....HE SUFFERS!!!(And how!)NOW of course he can write, and success quickly follows!  See? Simple!Now some of this is actual location work in Paris, but much is back in the studio on some fairly obvious sets with painted street scene backdrops.(I'm sure the quite elaborate one under the bridge near Ntre Dame was later used again in the execrable &#34;Made in Paris&#34; with Ann Margaret!)The very popular title tune gets a serious workout here, being played in various forms throughout most of the film.It does become a little tiring, ...but nowhere near as annoying as the tediously grating repetition of that schmaltzy Mancini-mush in &#34;Breakfast at Tiffany's&#34;!The main problem with this movie today is that you can always see where it's going. Fitzgerald was never a very original writer when it came to plots. The enjoyment for us is the cast, some great performances with the material given, ...and some pretty nifty set dressing, not to mention those gowns to die for.Four stars from me, ...I'd give it 4 if that was possible. I'm a sucker for anything even remotely about Paris, but this certainly has eye-appeal and holds your interest throughout, despite the contrivance of the ending.",4,The First Time You'll Enjoy it!,1400112000,"05 15, 2014",2014,4461,"['FIRST', 'FOREMOST', 'DO', 'make', 'sure', 'purchase', 'Warner', 'Brother', 'ARCHIVE', 'COLLECTION', 'movie', 'are', 'few', 'others', 'floating', 'are', 'VERY', 'bad', 'transfers', 'one', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'boxed', 'set', 'truly', 'appalling', 'quality', 'release', 'mention', 'not', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'certainly', 'very', 'watchable.Now', 'movie.Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'never', 'looked', 'more', 'beautiful', 'gowned', 'perfection.One', 'pale', 'pink', 'beaded', 'ball', 'gown', 'looks', 'something', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'might', 'have', 'worn', '.had', 'had', 'money', 'very', 'believable', 'performance', 'here', 'too', 'whiny', 'Southern', 'accents.It', 'material', 'given', 'fault', 'movie', 'unsure', 'tearaway', 'free-spirit', 'dutiful', 'wife', 'long-suffering', 'mother.One', 'minute', 'being', 'arrested', 'jumping', 'fountains', 'then', 'see', 'trying', 'salvage', 'husband', 'self', 'esteem.This', 'probably', 'more', 'fault', 'screenplay', 'adaption', 'original', 'story', 'anything', 'else.Walter', 'Pigeon', 'sort', 'ageing', 'rou', 'eacute', 'perennially', 'broke', 'fond', '34', 'get-rich-quick', '34', 'schemes', 'always', 'borrowing', 'money', 'charming', 'roguish', 'sort', 'way.I', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'great', 'fan', 'Van', 'Johnson', 'perfectly', 'adequate', 'here', 'find', 'somewhat', 'lacking', 'charisma', 'romantic', 'lead', 'Just', 'how', 'many', 'damn', 'freckles', 'can', 'anyone', 'have', 'forehead', 'anyway', 'Archive', 'print', 'certainly', 'up', 'detail', 'F.', 'Scott', 'Fitzgerald', 'sort', 'wannabee', 'writer', 'aforementioned', 'having', 'written', 'story', 'struggles', 'produce', 'first', 'great', 'novel', 'flirting', 'alcoholism', 'marital', 'infidelity', 'way.A', 'series', 'rejection', 'slips', 'suffer', 'psychological', 'problems', 'self', 'worth', 'developing', 'quite', 'careless', 'approach', 'life', 'Fast', 'cars', 'fast', 'women', 'form', 'Eva', 'Gabor', 'become', 'escape.Gabor', 'plays', '..well', 'really', 'always', 'husbands', 'here', 'just', 'real', 'life', 'certainly', 'not', 'borrowing', 'somebody', 'else', 'Watch', 'disdain', 'when', 'part', 'Monte', 'Carlo', 'rally', 'open', 'topped', 'sports', 'car', 'rainstorm', 'Frankly', 'could', 'not', 'fathom', 'why', 'Johnson', 'would', 'even', 'be', 'interested', 'Gabor', 'artifice', 'when', 'already', 'had', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'Anyway', '.Johnson', 'character', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'up', 'writer', 'almost', 'suicidal', 'spiral', 'booze', 'self-loathing.Donna', 'Reed', 'unflattering', 'role', 'less', 'attractive', 'sister', 'Taylor', 'Reed', 'always', 'so', 'obviously', 'been', 'love', 'Johnson', 'marry', 'more', 'fascinating', 'sister', 'Reed', 'left', 'carry', 'long-burning', 'torch', 'marriage', 'man.The', 'curiosity', 'movie', 'seeing', 'very', 'young', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'play', 'gigolo', 'cum', 'tennis', 'player', 'long', 'James', 'Bond', 'was', 'even', 'suitably', '34', 'gorgeous', '34', 'just', 'know', 'cad.Now', 'know', 'so', 'well', '.you', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'be', '34', 'artist', '34', '34', 'writer', '34', 'have', 'SUFFERED', 'Intentional', 'capitals', 'emphasis', 'realise', 'why', 'Johnson', 'getting', 'rejection', 'got', 'too', 'good', 'got', 'Liz', 'start', 'Anyway', 'giving', 'away', 'spoilers', 'fate', 'own', 'death', 'wish', 'eventually', 'care', 'voil', 'agrave', 'SUFFERS', 'how', 'NOW', 'course', 'can', 'write', 'success', 'quickly', 'See', 'Simple', 'Now', 'actual', 'location', 'work', 'Paris', 'much', 'back', 'studio', 'fairly', 'obvious', 'sets', 'painted', 'street', 'scene', 'backdrops', ""'m"", 'sure', 'quite', 'elaborate', 'one', 'bridge', 'Ntre', 'Dame', 'was', 'later', 'used', 'again', 'execrable', '34', 'Made', 'Paris', '34', 'Ann', 'Margaret', 'very', 'popular', 'title', 'tune', 'serious', 'workout', 'here', 'being', 'played', 'various', 'forms', 'most', 'film.It', 'become', 'little', 'tiring', 'nowhere', 'as', 'annoying', 'tediously', 'grating', 'repetition', 'schmaltzy', 'Mancini-mush', '34', 'Breakfast', 'Tiffany', '34', 'main', 'problem', 'movie', 'today', 'can', 'always', 'see', 'where', 'going', 'Fitzgerald', 'was', 'never', 'very', 'original', 'writer', 'when', 'came', 'plots', 'enjoyment', 'cast', 'great', 'performances', 'material', 'given', 'pretty', 'nifty', 'set', 'dressing', 'not', 'mention', 'gowns', 'die', 'for.Four', 'stars', ""'d"", 'give', '4', 'was', 'possible', ""'m"", 'sucker', 'anything', 'even', 'remotely', 'Paris', 'certainly', 'eye-appeal', 'interest', 'contrivance', 'ending']",N/A

(Van Johnson) meets an attractive American (Donna Reed) in a bar but when he meets her sister (Elizabeth Taylor), it's love at first sight. Based on the short story BABYLON REVISITED by F. Scott Fitzgerald, the film has been updated from its 1920s ""lost generation"" setting to post WWII Paris. Yet the setting seems wrong because the characters themselves still feel like they walked out of his TENDER IS THE NIGHT. That aside, the film remains a glossy and lush melodrama of a free spirit (Taylor) mismatched with a buttoned down newsman (Johnson, the film's only weak link). Taylor is at her most movie goddess beautiful here and looks terrific in her Helen Rose gowns. In contrast, Reed overdoes the bottled up, resentful sister. The Jerome Kern/Oscar Hammerstein song The Last Time I Saw Paris is lovely but overused in the underscore to the point of distraction.
