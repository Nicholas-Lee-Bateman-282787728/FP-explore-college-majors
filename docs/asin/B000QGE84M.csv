Smith,"[0, 1]","The young girl who plays the lead here does an amazing job of showing the jolt she goes through when she is torn away from her adoptive parents and told she was the child of people who disappeared during Argentina's '70s military dictatorship. Her love for her 'parents' turns to loathing over the course of the movie as she learns the ugly political truth and returns to what's left of her blood family. This is a pure character study. You don't see much of Buenos Aires, unfortunately. The flashbacks are handled adeptly.

1076191,A3EHIGO4FNILXP,B000QGE84M,.fgd,"[0, 3]",In every way this is a superb film. Well-acted with deserved caution against sentimentality or histrionics.The beginning has a nightmare quality where the helplessness of Christine/ Sophia under arrest of the powers that be are a mere taste of what happened to Sophia Lombardi's parents ; normal sensitive cultured  people just as she stripped of rights quite suddenly. And why?  Because governments can in other countries. It is pause for thought a detention law without accountability was passed recently in the States under the cause of anti-terrorism ;applicable to US citizens although paranoiac to consider its mis-use.The music of the film sounds like a requiem and tastefully chosen. Sophia's initial confusion is well-directed and the film has a correct pace important to a film about unfoldment.However the film is too politically correct and idealistic for my sensabilities. It is hard to believe a teenager would realise the total justice AND be able to make the emotional transition at the same time. Because it is the right thing to do out of loyalty and respect for the family and murdered parents. I believe the real tradgedy is that the recovered children can't or don't. The real parents ARE the ones they are brought up with. It is too deep a bond. The rest is projection even if 100% correct in theory.There was definitely a lack of conflict in Sophia regarding this which is understandable as the director made the film with the intention to expose and remember the past. It is important. Worse Than War shows an interview with an old South American statesman who did horrible genocides in his youth yet is free to live in his own country today with immunity. As this film informs us happens in Argentina today. Cornered in public he was asked to be accountable for his deeds. He replied that he is just an old man and it was so long ago it doesn't matter. And yet the tragic irony is the children are too young for it to matter either At least the film could show it takes a lot of time to achieve.,3,good but politically-correct,1352678400,"11 12, 2012",2012,2020,"['way', 'superb', 'film', 'Well-acted', 'deserved', 'caution', 'sentimentality', 'histrionics.The', 'beginning', 'nightmare', 'quality', 'where', 'helplessness', 'Christine/', 'Sophia', 'arrest', 'powers', 'be', 'are', 'mere', 'taste', 'what', 'happened', 'Sophia', 'Lombardi', 'parents', 'normal', 'sensitive', 'cultured', 'people', 'just', 'stripped', 'rights', 'quite', 'suddenly', 'why', 'governments', 'can', 'other', 'countries', 'thought', 'detention', 'law', 'accountability', 'was', 'passed', 'recently', 'States', 'cause', 'anti-terrorism', 'applicable', 'US', 'citizens', 'paranoiac', 'consider', 'mis-use.The', 'music', 'film', 'requiem', 'tastefully', 'chosen', 'Sophia', 'initial', 'confusion', 'well-directed', 'film', 'correct', 'pace', 'important', 'film', 'film', 'too', 'politically', 'correct', 'idealistic', 'sensabilities', 'hard', 'believe', 'teenager', 'would', 'realise', 'total', 'justice', 'be', 'able', 'make', 'emotional', 'transition', 'same', 'time', 'right', 'thing', 'do', 'loyalty', 'respect', 'family', 'murdered', 'parents', 'believe', 'real', 'tradgedy', 'recovered', 'children', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', ""n't"", 'real', 'parents', 'ARE', 'ones', 'are', 'brought', 'up', 'too', 'deep', 'bond', 'rest', 'projection', 'even', '100', '%', 'correct', 'theory.There', 'was', 'definitely', 'lack', 'conflict', 'Sophia', 'regarding', 'understandable', 'director', 'made', 'film', 'intention', 'expose', 'remember', 'past', 'important', 'Worse', 'Than', 'War', 'interview', 'old', 'South', 'American', 'statesman', 'who', 'did', 'horrible', 'genocides', 'youth', 'yet', 'free', 'live', 'own', 'country', 'today', 'immunity', 'film', 'Argentina', 'today', 'Cornered', 'public', 'was', 'asked', 'be', 'accountable', 'deeds', 'replied', 'just', 'old', 'man', 'was', 'so', 'long', ""n't"", 'matter', 'yet', 'tragic', 'irony', 'children', 'are', 'too', 'young', 'matter', 'either', 'least', 'film', 'could', 'show', 'lot', 'time', 'achieve']",Cautiva
1076192,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000QGE84M,Grady Harp,"[9, 9]","CAUTIVA ('Captive') is a very effective film by young writer/director Gaston Biraben who has taken to task the impact of Argentina's 'Dirty War' of the late 1970s and succeeds in making a very personal story out of the horror of the 'desaparecidos' tragedy that stole from Argentina some of its brightest minds - and 'reassigned' the children of these 'disappeared ones' who were born in the prisons to political friends of the dictatorship.  While the concept is gruesome as history and as content, Biraben manages to recreate that terrifying period of time in terms of the present. This retrospective study makes a huge impact.Cristina Quadri (the deeply impressive B&aacute;rbara Lombardo) lives with her parents in Buenos Aires, attending a Catholic girls' school, seemingly a happy young teenager.  One regular day she is called to the principal's office and told she must visit a judge, a frightening concept for a young girl who is forced to go without informing her parents.  The judge informs her that she is not 'Cristina Quadri' but instead 'Sof&iacute;a Lombardi', the daughter of a couple who 'disappeared' in 1978 as political prisoners.  A recent blood test Cristina/Sofia thought was a follow-up for a post-op check was actually a test to match her blood with that of the newly discovered true parents' family. Cristina, stunned by her lack of true identity, confronts her 'adopted parents' and struggles with the officials who insist she be returned to her blood relatives.  Cristina becomes close to another 'adopted' girl and the two explore their roots, finding that they were born in prisons and then given to police officials to be placed in homes.  The transition from adopted to blood family is the path the film explores: despite the comforts of present life the girls must know their origins to fully realize their identities.The cast is uniformly strong, the concept of the film works well as Biraben snaps us back and forth between the World Cup Soccer Game in Buenos Aires in 1978 that contrasts so gravely with the concurrent underground disappearance of the intellects of the country, and the performance by Lombardo holds the credibility of the story well.  There is a fine music score by Jos&eacute; Luis Casti&ntilde;eira de Dios that combines a suite for cello and piano with elements from Mozart's Requiem very effectively.  This film has been awarded many prizes since its appearance in 2003: the prizes are justly deserved.  Highly recommended viewing.

This time it is the child's version of that story, as a schoolgirl discovers and slowly comes to understand that the parents who have raised her in fact acquired her illegally, and that her actual parents were killed while being held in clandestine prisons by secret police.
