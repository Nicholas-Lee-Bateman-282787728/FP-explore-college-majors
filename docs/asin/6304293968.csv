This is actually Disney's very first direct-to-video live action films, which was first released in 1997.  It did not go over well and has long since been the hardest to find of the trio.  Unlike the other two theatrical films, this movie was only ever released in full frame... so us widescreen enthusiasts have nothing to complain about here.  What I can complain about is the overall cheap-feeling that this film has.  Rick Moranis is the only original character, and the action does not have the epic, theatrical quality of the original films.  This feels like a 2-day shoot soundstage production with a very closed-in feeling.  It's kind of like taking the first five minutes of ""Toy Story,"" with the army men on the staircase, etc. and extending that claustrophobic feeling for the 65-minute running time.  All in all, this most compares to a typical Disney Channel Original Movie.  In fact, it's been shown as one ever since its release!!

413696,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,6304293968,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[14, 14]","Remember the funny movie ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids,"" and the almost as funny ""Honey, I Blew Up the Kid?""  Well, this movie is much like those.  Except in this movie there is a different wife.  Oh; and there are kids missing.  And now Wayne Szalinski's (Rick Moranis) brother Gordon (Stuart Pankin) has appeared.  Perhaps this movie is not so much like those after all.We quickly learn that a few things have changed for Wayne since last we visited him.  The FDA has forbidden Wayne to use his shrinking machine on people.  Wayne is in the process of sending his shrinking machine to the Smithsonian.  Wayne and Gordon's wives are heading off to a vacation, leaving Wayne in Gordon in charge of the house.All initially seems sort of well, except that Wayne wants to shrink a Tiki man that his wife wants to him to throw away.  Predictably, something goes wrong and Wayne and Gordon are accidentally shrunk.  Shortly thereafter the wives, realizing they forgot to leave medicine behind, return.  Soon the wives are accidentally shrunk, and we are once again on a path for a few yucks and a few groans.This movie is reasonably decent.  Much of it seems somewhat of a retread.  There are the usual moments of fear as the foursome run from a cockroach and help a daddy longlegs spider, more moments of fun in a ride on a toy car, a dip in the dip, a ride in a soap bubble, and more.This direct-to-video movie has less imagination than the first two movies.  The atmosphere of this 75 minute ""full-length"" feature is that of a made-for-tv movie.  I did enjoy the movie, but I wish I had looked for it in a bargain bin somewhere rather than paying full price.If you really liked the first two movies, you will likely enjoy this movie.  If you cared little for the first two movies, you should avoid this one.  Even if you think you might like it, the movie still feels like something made for the Disney channel.

But when Honey, We Shrunk Oursevles was released on the Disney Channel I wasted no time in watching it and loved it. I had taped it on video but decided to purchase it on DVD throgh Amazon. It was unfortunate that when it and the other DVD I ordered with it came in the middle of my moving to a new place so it was a while before I viewed it, and a while before my review. The disc played perfectly with no skips or other problems, and I enjoyed the antics of Wayne, Marcia, Gordon and Patty, as they tried to figure out a way to return themselves to full size while viewing with growing apprehension the antics of their children. While some scenes, such as how Marcia and Patty get transported to the top of the counter for Mitch's medicine, strained my credibility a little, it is still a movie that brings out a lot of laughs and chuckles. The part where some older boys break in on an impromptu party may be a bit much for younger kids. One scene involving Wayne and Marcia's son and a certain magazine that opened Wayne's eyes up to the fact maybe his son wasn't meant to be a scientist, and how Patty's daughter proves she is more responsible than her mother thought at first, might give parents insights into their own kids' feelings about similar matters.",4,A Worthwhile Sequel,1245196800,"06 17, 2009",2009,1403,"['Even', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Honey', 'Shrunk', 'Kids', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'trailers', 'Honey', 'Blew', 'Kid', 'skipped', 'one', 'when', 'Honey', 'Shrunk', 'Oursevles', 'was', 'released', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'wasted', 'time', 'watching', 'loved', 'had', 'taped', 'video', 'decided', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'throgh', 'Amazon', 'was', 'unfortunate', 'when', 'other', 'DVD', 'ordered', 'came', 'middle', 'moving', 'new', 'place', 'was', 'while', 'viewed', 'while', 'review', 'disc', 'played', 'perfectly', 'skips', 'other', 'problems', 'enjoyed', 'antics', 'Wayne', 'Marcia', 'Gordon', 'Patty', 'tried', 'figure', 'out', 'way', 'return', 'full', 'size', 'viewing', 'growing', 'apprehension', 'antics', 'children', 'scenes', 'such', 'how', 'Marcia', 'Patty', 'get', 'transported', 'top', 'counter', 'Mitch', 'medicine', 'strained', 'credibility', 'little', 'still', 'movie', 'out', 'lot', 'laughs', 'chuckles', 'part', 'where', 'older', 'boys', 'break', 'impromptu', 'party', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'much', 'younger', 'kids', 'One', 'scene', 'involving', 'Wayne', 'Marcia', 'son', 'certain', 'magazine', 'opened', 'Wayne', 'eyes', 'fact', 'maybe', 'son', 'was', ""n't"", 'meant', 'be', 'scientist', 'how', 'Patty', 'daughter', 'more', 'responsible', 'mother', 'thought', 'first', 'might', 'give', 'parents', 'insights', 'own', 'kids', 'feelings', 'similar', 'matters']","Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves Walt Disney Pictures Presents  VHS"
