Again, this is a kids movie and obviously was meant for kids, can't expect something really deep.  I payed extra for a 3-D experience, but I still felt they didn't utilize the 3-D aspect to it's full potential.  I'd sit there almost begging for more things to pop out of the screen, but rarely anything would happen.  At the very least, adults will enjoy the pop culture references that almost every single child would not understand...I mean, how else would they keep the adults in the theater?  The movie has good animation, but the storyline just seemed very mediocre to me.",2,"Kid movie, with pop culture references for adults.",1239062400,"04 7, 2009",2009,682,"['movie', 'started', 'out', 'pretty', 'good', 'However', 'nothing', 'ever', 'got', 'deep', 'enough', 'character', 'development', 'Again', 'kids', 'movie', 'obviously', 'was', 'meant', 'kids', 'ca', ""n't"", 'expect', 'something', 'really', 'deep', 'payed', 'extra', '3-D', 'experience', 'still', 'felt', 'did', ""n't"", 'utilize', '3-D', 'aspect', 'full', 'potential', ""'d"", 'sit', 'there', 'almost', 'begging', 'more', 'things', 'pop', 'screen', 'rarely', 'anything', 'would', 'happen', 'very', 'least', 'adults', 'will', 'enjoy', 'pop', 'culture', 'almost', 'single', 'child', 'would', 'not', 'understand', 'mean', 'how', 'else', 'would', 'keep', 'adults', 'theater', 'movie', 'good', 'animation', 'storyline', 'just', 'seemed', 'very', 'mediocre']",Monsters vs. Aliens
1196531,A37T4NN3DV3U75,B001GCUO7K,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","We got this on Blu Ray and it looks amazing.  The animation was just flat out great and in the HD format the characters and environments just come to life.  Especially a screen in San Fransisco has a tremendous amount of detail.The story and characters are all very well written, extremely well animated, and the actors did a great job of bringing their voices to life.  There was a lot of good clean humor with an easy to follow plot.  I especially liked our heroine giant as she did a wonderful job with a well written character.  I like how this character grows over the course of the movie and does not fit any female stereotypes or played as a ditz but is instead a strong and courageous woman.  We need more characters like that.The extra movie for BOB's birthday was great.  It was really funny and gave a little more back story on the main characters.  It was also in 3D was was fun.The only downside is the film lacked 3D for the main film even though it had it in the theatres and comes with glasses for BOBs birthday film... but no 3D option for the main movie.  We are not really big into 3D or anything but it would be nice to at least have the option since that is how they made the movie.  Coraline offered both versions for example.Overall we love the film and it just looks so crisp and clear on blu ray.  I would have given it 5 stars had the movie come in 3D.

1196537,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001GCUO7K,Chris Pandolfi,"[0, 2]","""Monsters vs. Aliens"" is just plain fun, a film, I suspect, adults will enjoy more than children. Yes, it does have plenty for children to enjoy, not the least of which are the impressive animation effects and the fact that it's presented in 3-D. But consider the fact that numerous satirical references are made to global warming and the American government, and one character is given one or two hilarious lines regarding her thumbs and how one is smaller than the other: Will kids really understand or even notice these touches? I tend to doubt it. Regardless, I think everyone will enjoy this film. If you're one of those people who think 3-D effects are distracting, don't worry--not all theaters playing ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" are equipped to show it in 3-D. You therefore have the option of experiencing it without being subjected to objects flying off the screen.The story begins on the day Modesto native Susan Murphy (voiced by Reese Witherspoon) is to be married to local TV weatherman Derek Dietl (voiced by Paul Rudd). As she stands outside the church, waiting for the ceremony to begin, a meteorite suddenly falls from the sky and lands directly on top of her. She isn't killed, but the strange radiation from the meteorite transforms her into a giant; it isn't long before she's tranquilized by government agents and taken away.When she awakens, she learns that she's being held in a secret high tech facility designed to keep monsters out of the public eye. She then meets four of the residents. The first, nicknamed B.O.B. (voiced by Seth Rogen), is a viscous blue blob with one eye and no brain, the result of a genetic accident involving a tomato and a packet of ranch dressing. The second, Dr. Cockroach Ph.D. (voiced by Hugh Laurie) was once a man until a machine fused his DNA with that of an insect; now he's a child-sized bug who likes to laugh like an evil scientist. The third, The Missing Link (voiced by Will Arnett), is a fish-human hybrid who isn't the most physically able but likes to pretend that he is. The fourth is Insectosaurus, a monstrous caterpillar that once attacked Tokyo. The facility they're in is run by the aptly named W.R. Monger (voiced by Kiefer Sutherland), a tough-talking general whose Southern accent is second only to his loud voice. Because of her enormous size, he gives Susan the nickname Ginormica.(If I may digress for a moment: If you take another look at the way I described the monsters, you might notice that they were inspired by five famous monster movies--""Attack of the 50 Ft. Woman,"" ""The Blob,"" ""The Fly,"" ""Creature from the Black Lagoon,"" and ""Mothra."")When a tentacled alien creature named Gallaxhar (voiced by Rainn Wilson) sends a giant robot probe to Earth on a mission of destruction, Monger convinces the President (voiced by Stephen Colbert) to let the monsters take care of the problem. At this point, it becomes a journey of self-discovery for Susan--she essentially begins realizing that she's actually achieved something by being transformed into a monster, and because of that, she starts to rethink her relationship with Derek. It's not as if he was all that nice a guy to begin with.But what am I talking about? Not too many people will see ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" looking for a commentary on self-esteem. Above all else, it's a light-hearted animated comedy built around inside jokes, witty dialogue, and sight gags. A good example of the last is the scene in which Susan finds herself fighting against Gallaxher's robot; before trying to save innocent people driving on the Golden Gate Bridge, she puts both her feet into cars and uses them to roller skate down the hilly streets of San Francisco. And then there's the recurring gag of two identical, gigantic red buttons in the middle of a secret military compound. One of them releases nuclear weapons while the other dispenses lattes. Naturally, the President is often confused about which one is which.I have no doubt that the one character audiences will love the most is B.O.B. He seems so delightfully brainless, and you know this is true when he thinks that Susan is a boy because only boys have breasts. There's also his brief romantic triste with a plateful of green Jell-O, who he thinks gave him a fake phone number. You just can't help but laugh every time he appears on screen.The long and short of it is that ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" is a thoroughly enjoyable animated film, and while the 3-D process is at times a little too intrusive (as in the beginning, when a man sits at a desk, playing with a paddleball), it ultimately serves the story very well. It certainly holds up better than many recent films presented in 3-D, including the delightful ""Coraline."" I suspect the satirical sense of humor will be lost on kids, but the physical gags certainly won't. So it seems we have one of those rare cases when a cartoon was made with all audiences in mind. I had a lot of fun watching this movie, and if you're in need of lighthearted comedy with great visual effects, I'm sure you will feel the same way.",4,Send in the Mutant Troops!,1239926400,"04 17,

As with all American mage animated films, there are the obligatory inside jokes for adults and a moral about ""following your heart"" and female empowerment (that's been a compulsory theme ever since ""The Little Mermaid"" was in theatres). Things do blow up real good, and kids will appreciate all the colors and moving stuff but the movie has no real heart. Nothing in this film really engaged me.Then there are these other subtle themes that you can derive from this film. Its interesting that people will accept a cockroach scientist, a 60 foot tall woman and aliens in a movie, but a non-secretive, competent, effective government is way too fantastic. Another trend in films like this, all the men in the movie are crazy, weak, cowardly or selfish - great role models for boys.In general, Monsters Vs Aliens is a so-so movie, not very memorable.

It is visually stunning, even apart from the 3D effects, which were AMAZING and worth every penny of the price of admission. The story was amazingly pro-female empowerment, even though the protagonist's physique was, uh, idealized. However, the message was put across without any sort of preachiness or any suggestion that the message did not apply equally to boys, so my son was (astoundingly) able to identify with the main character even though he's at an age where he no longer plays very much with his female schoolmates. The film was not scary at all for him. I didn't love the bits of fantasy violence, but they didn't ruin the movie for me.The voice-over acting was great. Reese Witherspoon has a very expressive voice that was not immediately recognizable to me as any of her movie characters. This made Susan/Ginormica seem unique and real. The other actors seemed to be going for something almost retro-cartoonish, which worked brilliantly in context with the monster movie theme.The plot was a bit thin in spots, but I've watched the movie numerous times now since seeing it in the theater, and it's still amusing.

So after a morning at the mall and a festive lunch, off we went to collect our 3D glasses and settle in for the big show.DreamWorks Animation dishes up a terrific family movie with MONSTERS VS ALIENS. The story is a bit thin but who cares? the characters rock. Susan Murphy gets hit by a meteorite just before her wedding in Modesto, California, and she grows to an incredible 49 feet, 11 inches in height. The U.S. Army ""captures"" her and incarcerates her in a secret monster facility underground, where she meets her fellow monsters: a smart mutant half-cockroach helpfully named Dr. Cockroach, a blob of blue protoplasm named B.O.B., the fishy Link, and the giant Insectosaurus.Susan (who has been given the code name Ginormica) and the rest of the monster crew are released and commissioned to defend earth against a gigantic evil robot--and after an epic battle, they are victorious. Too bad about the Golden Gate Bridge but it can be built again better than new, surely? Susan tries to settle back in to her old life but at just under 50 feet tall, it really doesn't work out for her. Her sleazy fiance dumps her to focus on his career in broadcasting, and Susan realizes that she has true friends among the monsters and takes pleasure in her power. When the alien threat to Earth reappears (""I come in peace. Most of you will be killed ... but I come in peace"") Susan and the crew save Earth.The 3D graphics are superb; this is a movie that entertained all of us from the five-year-old on up.  The voice casting generally worked well, especially Reese Witherspoon as Susan and Hugh Laurie as Dr. Cockroach. I was dubious about Susan when I first saw her Barbie-like looks and shape, but this is a girl who gets by on her brains and power, so there was no damage control necessary with my granddaughters. (Who knew that getting hit with a meteorite on your wedding day and growing to 50 feet tall could turn out to be good luck?) As for violence, you can't expect monsters and aliens to clash without somebody getting hurt, but mostly there was a lot of spectacular roaring and blowing up and nothing to speak of in the way of gore.I can see that I've been missing out on a fine treat by skipping these DreamWorks productions.

But shortly before Susan (Reese Witherspoon) marries local weatherman Derek (Paul Rudd), she is struck by a meteor.  But what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.  And taller.  As Susan grows to the size of a giantess, the government shows up and takes her away to a secret facility.It is there that she finds out she isn't the only monster rounded up over the years.  There's B.O.B, a giant blob of goo (Seth Rogen), Dr. Cockroach, Ph.D., a mad scientist who turned himself into a human cockroach (Hugh Laurie), The Missing Link, a fish monster (Will Arnett), and Insectasaurus, a giant caterpillar.The five monsters might have stayed locked up forever if it weren't for the alien invasion.  The governments, lead by President Hathaway (Stephen Colbert), makes the monsters a deal.  If they will defeat the alien, they will be released from prison.  Can they save San Francisco from the menace?Where do I even begin with this film?Let's start with the negative aspect, the story is predictable.  I had all the major plot points figured out by the half way point.  So if you watch this movie looking for originality, you will be disappointed.However, I can't fault the producers for dragging things out.  The story moved very quickly from one plot point to the next.  Not that this weakened the characters.  Susan is really our main character, but everyone gets some time to develop.  I grew to love all five of our main monsters and was rooting for them to come out on top.And the movie is hilarious.  I am not too familiar with the 50's monster and alien movies, but it was still clear to me that's what was being spoofed.  Plus the one liners were enough to keep me and my friends laughing the entire time.The voice talent did a great job, and the animation was as realistic as it could be considering all the fantasy elements involved.Being Dreamworks, there were a couple of slightly off color jokes that I didn't fully appreciate.  But most of the movie was acceptable for kids of all ages.  And the movie is so funny I seriously doubt it would scare any but the youngest of children.I have written off Dreamworks animation in years past because it didn't look too good.  While this movie wasn't enough to make me into a die hard fan of their work, it was enough for me to take look at their future movies at lot more seriously.

It starts out pretty decent from what I remember but somewhere in there it begins to take a nose dive, crashes and burns, then crashes again. The story to the film is just there as a side attraction to the monstrosity consuming the screen. The short films spawned off of this film aren&#8217;t half bad though, I can recommend those.

But boy oh boy, if you have a cartoon...oops, sorry...I mean ""animated feature"" the stars line up to be cast. And indeed they ALL do get cast!Monsters vs Aliens has at least 10 big (big today anyway) names voicing various characters in the movie. You'd have to be Martin Scorsese to make that happen in a ""real people"" movie in this century. But no...directing Monsters vs Aliens is...um...that guy that did Shark Tale...what's his name? Well whoever he is, he must be well liked and well respected to get so many A-list ""I'll do its"". See...it doesn't take a village to get the rich and famous to do something nice for families...it just takes a cartoon!Monsters vs Aliens is quite entertaining. It ain't no Incredibles (and it ain't no Goodfellas!), but if you have kids, or you just enjoy cartoons, Monsters vs Aliens will satisfy. My kids loved it. My 6 year old laughed all the way through and my 10 year old proclaimed it ""maybe"" the best animated movie he'd ever seem. The MPAA hit it with a ridiculous PG rating. Do they ever give anything other than The Muppets or Barney a G anymore? We'd better have monsters in hiding to fight our battles in 10 years because today's kids are gonna be doggone soft when they grow up.The movie was good. It teaches the value of friendship and staying loyal to your positive beliefs. There are some truly funny moments and best of all, the movie was pretty short.

1196585,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B001GCUO7K,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[2, 4]","Wonderfully inventive characters and highly polished visuals abound in Dreamworks' latest computer animation extravaganza, working diligently to disprove the concept that story is the most important element. With hilarious caricatures, gargantuan CG sets, and grandiose action sequences, it almost succeeds. But ultimately the aesthetics can't win out over an expected plot, hit-or-miss humor, and characters whose personalities don't live up to their appealing appearances (as well as quite a few underused voice talents, such as the tragically unrecognizable Renee Zellweger, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd).On her wedding day (in Fresno California, the most romantic city in the world), Susan Murphy (Reese Witherspoon) is hit by a meteorite infused with Quantonium, a rare and powerful element that causes her to grow to an enormous size. Targeted by the government as a ""monster,"" Susan is captured and imprisoned at a secret facility where other such oddities have been held since the 1950's, when it was deemed that the public couldn't handle the presence of extraterrestrials. Governed by Patton-esque General Monger (Kiefer Sutherland), the tenants include Dr. Cockroach (Hugh Laurie), a mad scientist who accidentally transformed himself into a roach-human hybrid; B.O.B. (Seth Rogen), a gelatinous, brainless mass brought to life in an experiment gone wrong; The Missing Link (Will Arnett), a Creature-from-the-Black-Lagoon-like lizard man; and the skyscraper-sized mutant larvae Insectosaurus.When deranged alien overlord Gallaxhar (Rainn Wilson) arrives on Earth to obtain the precious Quantonium and conquer the world, President Hathaway (Stephen Colbert) offers the monsters their freedom in exchange for defeating the evil mastermind and his legion of robots and clones. ""Do something violent!"" commands the trembling American leader, after giving an ineffective welcoming to a towering probe droid. (In a spoof of Close Encounters of the Third Kind, the President unleashes a series of jazzy funk beats and dance moves that tops the hilarity with its wild spontaneity.)Pixar may be the heavyweight champion of computer animated feature films, but Dreamworks Animation is steadily making its way into the ring. With Monsters vs. Aliens, they've gotten the formula down pat - exhilarating action, amazing special effects, humorous character designs and a relatively preach-free plot. The intensity of the film is extraordinary, with an attack on the Golden Gate Bridge matching the sheer magnitude of destruction in Cloverfield and challenging the awe of Independence Day and Godzilla. The throwbacks to classic B-movie monstrosities form an homage collage that rivals the research put into The Incredibles' comic book character origins.Although Monsters vs. Aliens doesn't offer a noticeably large number of literally in-your-face moments, seeing it in 3D (and/or IMAX) certainly doesn't hurt. No details are spared with the absolutely brilliant CG models and animation, and the textures and lighting are consistently photorealistic. It may not rank amongst the greatest computer animated works, but in its technical mastery and pure entertainment achievements, it's out of this world.- The Massie Twins",4,Monsters Vs Aliens Review from The Massie Twins,1238112000,"03 27, 2009",2009,3214,"['Wonderfully', 'inventive', 'characters', 'highly', 'polished', 'visuals', 'abound', 'Dreamworks', 'latest', 'computer', 'animation', 'extravaganza', 'working', 'diligently', 'disprove', 'concept', 'story', 'most', 'important', 'element', 'hilarious', 'caricatures', 'gargantuan', 'CG', 'sets', 'grandiose', 'action', 'sequences', 'almost', 'ultimately', 'aesthetics', 'ca', ""n't"", 'win', 'out', 'expected', 'plot', 'hit-or-miss', 'humor', 'characters', 'personalities', 'do', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'appealing', 'appearances', 'as', 'well', 'quite', 'few', 'underused', 'voice', 'talents', 'such', 'tragically', 'unrecognizable', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'Amy', 'Poehler', 'Paul', 'Rudd', '.On', 'wedding', 'day', 'Fresno', 'California', 'most', 'romantic', 'city', 'world', 'Susan', 'Murphy', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'hit', 'meteorite', 'infused', 'Quantonium', 'rare', 'powerful', 'element', 'grow', 'enormous', 'size', 'Targeted', 'government', 'monster', 'Susan', 'captured', 'imprisoned', 'secret', 'facility', 'where', 'other', 'such', 'oddities', 'have', 'been', 'held', '1950', 'when', 'was', 'deemed', 'public', 'could', ""n't"", 'handle', 'presence', 'extraterrestrials', 'Governed', 'Patton-esque', 'General', 'Monger', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'tenants', 'include', 'Dr.', 'Cockroach', 'Hugh', 'Laurie', 'mad', 'scientist', 'who', 'accidentally', 'transformed', 'roach-human', 'hybrid', 'B.O.B', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'gelatinous', 'brainless', 'mass', 'brought', 'life', 'experiment', 'gone', 'wrong', 'Missing', 'Link', 'Will', 'Arnett', 'Creature-from-the-Black-Lagoon-like', 'lizard', 'man', 'skyscraper-sized', 'mutant', 'larvae', 'Insectosaurus.When', 'deranged', 'alien', 'overlord', 'Gallaxhar', 'Rainn', 'Wilson', 'Earth', 'obtain', 'precious', 'Quantonium', 'conquer', 'world', 'President', 'Hathaway', 'Stephen', 'Colbert', 'monsters', 'freedom', 'exchange', 'defeating', 'evil', 'mastermind', 'legion', 'robots', 'clones', 'Do', 'something', 'violent', 'trembling', 'American', 'leader', 'giving', 'ineffective', 'welcoming', 'towering', 'probe', 'droid', 'spoof', 'Close', 'Encounters', 'Third', 'Kind', 'President', 'series', 'jazzy', 'funk', 'beats', 'dance', 'moves', 'tops', 'hilarity', 'wild', 'spontaneity', 'Pixar', 'may', 'be', 'heavyweight', 'champion', 'computer', 'animated', 'feature', 'films', 'Dreamworks', 'Animation', 'steadily', 'making', 'way', 'ring', 'Monsters', 'vs.', 'Aliens', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'formula', 'down', 'pat', 'exhilarating', 'action', 'amazing', 'special', 'effects', 'humorous', 'character', 'designs', 'relatively', 'preach-free', 'plot', 'intensity', 'film', 'extraordinary', 'attack', 'Golden', 'Gate', 'Bridge', 'matching', 'sheer', 'magnitude', 'destruction', 'Cloverfield', 'challenging', 'awe', 'Independence', 'Day', 'Godzilla', 'throwbacks', 'classic', 'B-movie', 'monstrosities', 'form', 'homage', 'collage', 'research', 'put', 'Incredibles', 'comic', 'book', 'character', 'Monsters', 'vs.', 'Aliens', ""n't"", 'offer', 'noticeably', 'large', 'number', 'literally', 'in-your-face', 'moments', 'seeing', '3D', 'and/or', 'IMAX', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'details', 'are', 'spared', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'CG', 'models', 'animation', 'textures', 'lighting', 'are', 'consistently', 'photorealistic', 'may', 'not', 'rank', 'greatest', 'computer', 'animated', 'works', 'technical', 'mastery', 'pure', 'entertainment', 'achievements', 'world.-', 'Massie', 'Twins']",Monsters vs. Aliens
1196586,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B001GCUO7K,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[0, 2]","I am a huge fan of animated films. And since Pixar can't produce every animated film, I also go to Disney films. And since those two studios release only a few films every year, I also go to see DreamWorks animation. DreamWorks animated efforts are getting better, but they still lack the magic Pixar is able to create and the beauty Disney is capable of.In their newest release, ""Monsters Vs. Aliens"", the filmmakers blend a series of references to classic sci fi and monster films of the 50s, with the pop culture references that are de rigueur for any animated film today. The result is an enjoyable effort, enhanced by the 3D process it was created for. The key difference between this film and say ""Coraline"" or ""Bolt"" is that while the 3D enhances these far better films, it wasn't necessary to enjoy either. In ""Monsters Vs. Aliens"", the film  would seem a little lackluster without the 3D glasses. propped on your nose, making everything seem a little more lifelike.The story opens at a monitoring station in Antarctica. The bored technicians are hitting a ping-pong ball lazily in the air and at us. Woo. Watch out it might just hit you. This is an amusing signal to us that this film is going to make a lot of references to 3D films from the 50s, when the technology was first introduced to battle the threat of television. There is a similar scene in Vincent Price's ""House of Wax"" when a barker uses the same technique to get the attention of passerby, hitting the ball directly at us. The key difference between the two films is that the 3D process is so much more convincing now.Susan Murphy (voiced by Reese Witherspoon) is preparing to marry her fianc&eacute;e Derek Dietl (Paul Rudd) in their hometown of Modesto when Derek springs the news on Susan that they won't be going to Paris for their honeymoon, Derek needs to go to Fresno for an interview to become the anchor of their nightly news. He is on his way up and she tries to match his enthusiasm. Susan is upset, but she acquiesces and walks out to a gazebo, to think about the wedding, Derek, her life. Unfortunately, this is also the time and place a meteor strikes next to the gazebo. And Susan walks away, glowing. During the ceremony, she grows 50 feet and the Army quickly appears to try to control her. Later, she wakes up in a large containment facility run by General W. R. Monger (Kiefer Sutherland) and she meets the other inhabitants of the program; insectasourus, a large centipede, B.O.B. (Seth Rogen, ""Knocked Up"", ""Pineapple Express""), a big blue blob who seems to like everyone and doesn't seem to care that he has no brains, Dr. Cockroach (Hugh Laurie, TV's ""House""), a mad scientist who ran afoul of one of his own experiments and The Missing Link (Will Arnett, ""Blades of Glory"", TV's ""Arrested Development""), a man-sized fish like creature. They quickly come together to fight an Alien invasion led by Galaxhar (Rainn Wilson, TV's ""The Office""), who wants to take over the Earth because his planet was just destroyed. The President (Stephen Colbert, TV's ""The Colbert Report"") tries to talk to Galaxhar's robot emissary, but soon runs in retreat. But General Monger is confident his monsters can fight the aliens, so they head off to battle Galaxhar in the Bay Area.Directed by Rob Letterman and Conrad Vernon (who worked on ""Shark Tales"" and the ""Shrek"" films in various capacities) and co-written by Wallace Wolodarsky (one of the early, original writers on ""The Simpsons""), ""Monsters Vs. Aliens"" packs a lot of references to iconic sci fi films of the 50s and some real humor into the neat little story. The animation is also more stylized than we are used to, moving away from the hyper-realized visions filmmakers have been trying to achieve with some recent examples of animation. All of this helps give the film a sweet, good natured background, a slightly nostalgic appeal to match the small town Susan is from.Reese Witherspoon is good, but she isn't memorable enough or different enough to make the character stand out. When she becomes a fifty foot tall woman, she is christened Ginormica. But this is about the extent of her character becoming a monster or a super hero. Most of the time, we watch as Susan deals with her fianc&eacute;e Dirk, her mom and dad and her hometown. If this were a drama, bravo. But as it is an animated film, it doesn't feel like her character is taken far enough.Seth Rogen plays B.O.B., a blue mass of goo who seems to have no brains and just wants to be friends with people. But he also seems to be a little awkward around others; instead of hugging them, he swallows them and has to regurgitate them covered in blue goo.B.O.B. is extremely funny and so good-natured you almost want to reach up to the screen, grab him in your arms and give him a bear hug. Rogen infects him with his laid back personality and B.O.B. is quick to laugh, and smile. B.O.B. is also an example of an animated character given life by both the animators and the actor providing his voice. Generally, the animators try to match the character to the actor, working hard to ensure the character matches what the actor is doing. Robin Williams still remains the most memorable modern animated character as the Genie in Disney's ""Aladdin"", Tom Hanks and Tim Allen did great work in both ""Toy Story"" films, Jeremy Irons was great as Scar in ""The Lion King"". These are a few examples of the perfect combination of actor to character and material, all of which intersect allowing the actor to create a memorable character, someone who will live on in our minds and subconscious. I don't know if Rogen exactly achieves that with B.O.B., but he comes close. Darn close. Closer than most of the other actors in the cast.When Bob meets people, he wants to hug them, but he can't and he ends up swallowing them, only to immediately spit them out. Always laughing and smiling, B.O.B. likes to do tricks with his one eye and seems pretty oblivious. When he is scolded by someone, he frowns, but then quickly smiles and starts laughing, much like a child who doesn't completely understand what they have done. Its just fun to watch this character and he makes you laugh.He also hits on a molded Jello salad at one point, providing a big laugh later.Hugh Laurie (TV's ""House"") provides the voice for Dr. Cockroach. He's good, and it's funny to see the mad scientist role played to a certain limit, but this is another example of the character not going far enough. Will Arnett plays The Missing Link, who seems to be the giant Caterpillar's guardian and watchdog. Stephen Colbert has a few funny moments as the President.But the other stand out in the cast is, surprisingly, Kiefer Sutherland. Sutherland provides the voice for General W. R. Monger, the leader of the Monsters. It's a nice turn, clearly patterned after Slim Picken's performance in ""Dr. Strangelove"". His voice has that slight Southern twang and is full of bluster and bravado. Flying around in a jet pack, he seems to compensate for his short stature in other ways.Perhaps the highlight of the film is how many references to classic sci-fi and horror films from the 50s the filmmakers have packed in. For me, the most memorable was the ping pong paddle I mentioned before, but they manage to work in references to or gags about so many films it is a virtual treasure trove for people who loves films from this era. Some films provide a lot of visual jokes and puns (""Dr. Strangelove"", "":The Day The Earth Stood Still"", ""The Blob""), others provide more fleeting moments (""Mothra"", ""The Fly""). The filmmakers clearly love these films, providing a Valentine to the movies they grew up with.""Monsters Vs. Aliens"" is a very admiral effort and it is worth a look. While it can't reach the heights of a Pixar or Disney films, DreamWorks has their first solid, non ""Shrek"" hit on their hands.",4,DreamWorks is Getting Better.,1239753600,"04 15,

1196587,A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B001GCUO7K,"Tim Brough ""author and music buff""","[2, 5]","Filled with hommage and fluff, Dreamworks' ""Monsters Vs Aliens"" is lightweight kiddie fun but runs thin on substance. This is basically an extended Saturday Morning Comic stretched to 90 minutes. What is now standard for this kind of fare, pop culture jokes are jammed in to keep the parents (or in my case, Uncle) chuckling at the cleverness while funny voices, kinetic action and butt jokes amuse the tykes. In fact, the pop cultured among us will spot ""Close Encounters,"" Independence Day,"" ""Mothra"" and ""Bevererly Hills Cop"" cobbled into bits throughout ""Monsters Vs Aliens.""Cleverness does not a movie make, and while my five year old charge was laughing and clapping, I was losing interest by the time Gallaxhar (Rainn Wilson, in an unecessary bit of stunt casting) started forming his clone army. I appreciate that Susan/Ginormica was a powerful female who took no crap from her self-absorbed boyfriend and Keifer Sutherland (as General W.R.Monger) took the vinegar out of his Jack Bauer roles, but ""Monsters Vs Aliens"" is an unimaginative film fobbed of as Family Entertainment.

1196589,A3SLPJHXZYTT8A,B001GCUO7K,Ton Thai,"[0, 1]","When a radioactive meteor hurtles into Susan Murphy on her wedding day, she is transformed into a towering, platinum-haired giant. Taken away by the government, Susan is introduced to other scientific oddities, including the amphibious Missing Link , the dim blob B.O.B., and the brilliant, bug-headed Dr. Cockroach. These ""monsters"" are released from captivity when a massive alien robot sent by the scheming Gallaxhar appears in San Francisco. With little time to adjust to her new stature, Susan must learn to work with her strange allies to avoid an all-out extraterrestrial invasion.MVA is what I would call a ""safe"" movie. It's fluffy and nice, but it doesn't push boundaries. It sticks to entertaining the audience for 90 or so minutes and it does the job well. Compared to Pixar's most recent movie, UP, it's pretty much crap, but I won't do that because most animated movies can't reach Pixar's greatness.MVA starts off pretty quickly and the movie runs in a fast pace. I'll admit it, some of the jokes are plain dumb and unfunny. There's one scene where the president of the US plays a well-known tune when first meeting an alien spaceship. It was cringe-worthy to say the least. However, the movie also has a lot of funny moments, most coming from Seth Rogen's character, B.O.B. He's my favorite character in the movie. The other actors were decent, but nothing to shout about.The movie also has plenty of great spectacles and some truly vibrant action sequences. I did not see this movie in 3D, but this is one of the few rare movies where watching it in 3D could possibly make it a BETTER movie. As I watched through the movie, I envied the fact that I was watching it in 2D, seeing some obvious shots for the 3D technology when it was in theaters a few months back. But overall, it's a fast-paced, forgettable, harmless movie for the family to enjoy.",3,Oooze gonna save us?,1288656000,"11 2, 2010",2010,1864,"['When', 'radioactive', 'meteor', 'hurtles', 'Susan', 'Murphy', 'wedding', 'day', 'transformed', 'towering', 'platinum-haired', 'giant', 'Taken', 'away', 'government', 'Susan', 'introduced', 'other', 'scientific', 'oddities', 'including', 'amphibious', 'Missing', 'Link', 'dim', 'blob', 'B.O.B.', 'brilliant', 'bug-headed', 'Dr.', 'Cockroach', 'monsters', 'are', 'released', 'captivity', 'when', 'massive', 'alien', 'robot', 'sent', 'scheming', 'Gallaxhar', 'San', 'Francisco', 'little', 'time', 'adjust', 'new', 'stature', 'Susan', 'must', 'learn', 'work', 'strange', 'allies', 'avoid', 'all-out', 'extraterrestrial', 'invasion.MVA', 'what', 'would', 'call', 'safe', 'movie', 'fluffy', 'nice', ""n't"", 'push', 'boundaries', 'entertaining', 'audience', '90', 'so', 'minutes', 'job', 'well', 'Compared', 'Pixar', 'most', 'recent', 'movie', 'UP', 'pretty', 'much', 'crap', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'most', 'animated', 'movies', 'ca', ""n't"", 'reach', 'Pixar', 'greatness.MVA', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'movie', 'fast', 'pace', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'jokes', 'are', 'plain', 'dumb', 'unfunny', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'president', 'US', 'well-known', 'tune', 'when', 'first', 'meeting', 'alien', 'spaceship', 'was', 'cringe-worthy', 'say', 'least', 'However', 'movie', 'also', 'lot', 'funny', 'moments', 'most', 'coming', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'character', 'B.O.B', 'favorite', 'character', 'movie', 'other', 'actors', 'were', 'decent', 'nothing', 'shout', 'about.The', 'movie', 'also', 'plenty', 'great', 'spectacles', 'truly', 'vibrant', 'action', 'sequences', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'movie', '3D', 'one', 'few', 'rare', 'movies', 'where', 'watching', '3D', 'could', 'possibly', 'make', 'BETTER', 'movie', 'watched', 'movie', 'envied', 'fact', 'was', 'watching', '2D', 'seeing', 'obvious', 'shots', '3D', 'technology', 'when', 'was', 'theaters', 'few', 'months', 'back', 'overall', 'fast-paced', 'forgettable', 'harmless', 'movie', 'family', 'enjoy']",Monsters vs. Aliens
