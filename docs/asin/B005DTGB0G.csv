1456027,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B005DTGB0G,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","Where's my spoon? Hang on, as I try something.In the 415 area code - mister, that's in the Bay area - two feuding journalists are about to make their respective papers the morning must-read. Tom Lane (David Sutcliffe) is one of *those* guys, such a smooth operator. He writes for the mighty San Francisco Sun. Tom has got his ducks in a row, career on the fast track, set to land his own television show any minute now. Tom claims a - ehm, how did he put it? - ""21st century, metropolitan perspective"" on politics and art. His work computer, when he checks it in the morning, routinely has fifty messages waiting for him.In New York, Rebecca and Henry, roommates of six months, have just gotten engaged. But is six months long enough for them to really get to know each other? Both sets of parents harbor deep concerns, and perhaps rightfully so. Rebecca Fine (Vikki Krinsky, very cute) comes from an affluent Jewish family in Los Angeles. Henry Kringle (Tommy Lioutas) is a kid from Wisconsin, raised on midwestern Christian values. Maybe their disparate backgrounds wouldn't have mattered this early, but Rebecca and Henry couldn't pass up on the opportunity to meet their impending in-laws. Henry invites Rebecca's parents to come visit in his home town of Dunston, Wisconsin where his own parents lurk- er, I mean, await. It's a recipe for nothing good can come of this.Back in the Bay area, Liz Madison (Dina Meyer), unlike Tom Lane, has her ducks in no row whatsoever. Liz is sort of a hot mess, y'all. She runs an advice column for the small town periodical, the Marin County Voice. She has got a scattershot grasp of her life right now, what with her recent divorce and an aversion to dipping her toe back into the dating pool. Liz draws a blank when her young niece, Jacqui (Alexia Fast), astutely asks, ""How can you give advice on relationships when you don't even have one?"" Way to put your hot aunt on the spot, kid. Oh, and this morning, when Liz powered up her computer, guess how many messages were waiting? One message.In the other narrative, both sets of parents indulge in ignorant social psychology (but you can call it ""stereotyping""). Rebecca's mom, Suzie Fine (Wendie Malick), is talking smack about her prospective son-in-law: ""And he better not ask her to convert, because Jews don't convert. We are the Chosen Ones, after all."" (Never mind that the Fines haven't been to the temple in three years.) And then there's Henry's mom, Marilyn Kringle (Cynthia Stevenson), who does her bit of summing up: ""Jewish people are very sensitive and high strung."" It's suspected that the Fines and the Kringles are in for a spell of awkwaaard. Here's one such moment:- Rebecca (confirming her vegetarian preference): ""I don't eat anything that smiles.""- Mrs. Kringle: ""Okay. Quiche. Takes an hour, tops. I can get a recipe from the Internet...""- Henry: ""Mom, Rebecca, she doesn't eat cheese, either.""- Mrs. Kringle (flustered): ""Cheese can smile?""So much is made of the San Francisco Sun's recent acquisition of the floundering Marin County Voice. The Voice has been the dependable read for Marin County for the past 70 years, but circulation's dropped 16% from last year. To revive subscriptionship (if that's a word), Liz (the hot mess, remember?) retools her column, forsaking giving advice to them lonely hearts for the heartfelt editorial. And, apparently, Liz has a finger on the pulse of the community. Overnight, the Voice's readership increases. The Voice's turnaround success threatens Tom Lane's shot at a television show, and so his editor orders him to undermine Liz's column. And so was born Tom Lane's big city column dedicated to swift rebuttals of every little thing that Liz writes about. He ridiculous Liz's sensibilities as the ""contemporary sentiment of a 19th century schoolmarm."" Oh, snap.Note that the Wisconsin branch of Kringles has fully embraced their name. They celebrate Christmas with the intensity of a thousand suns. The Kringles have holiday-themed ring tones. They drive the Christmas mobile. They're ferocious in their participation in the annual neighborhood competition to see who could put up the best Christmas decorations. Their house looks like Santa's workshop if it exploded. I'm sure Wendie Malick can tamp down her snark, even when she espies that giant fiddler on the roof on the Kringles' roof. (Okay, the Kringles were only trying to make the Fines feel included in the holiday festivities, never mind that it comes off vaguely condescending (but remove the ""vaguely"" part). Maybe it's apt that Rebecca whimsically coins the whole thing ""Christmukkah.""Would you like a slice of that 1930s newsroom screwball? In His and Her Christmas (2005), Dina Meyer and David Sutcliffe are terrific in reviving that classic feud between two reporters who don't give an inch but inevitably fall in love. Meyer and Sutcliffe channel Hepburn & Tracy (Woman of the Year, 1942), Elizabeth Perkins and Kevin Bacon (He Said, She Said, 1991), and even Julia Roberts and Nick Nolte (I Love Trouble, 1994).Or maybe you prefer a madcap comedy of manners. Wendie Malick and Cynthia Stevenson drive this narrative. Will You Merry Me? (2008) plays up the anxiety attached not only to meeting your intended's parents for the first time but also in trying to find that common ground - or at least a neutral zone - between two conflicting life styles. Malick and Stevenson are so very funny as the two moms stubbornly at cross purposes. I love Malick's under-her-breath sarcasm and Stevenson's frequent freak outs. The kids initially just want to get married, but then their parents' influence begin to make them second guess. Can Rebecca and Henry hurdle the obstacles of warring cultures and holiday traditions? Meanwhile, the dads are mostly chill. I say ""mostly"" because Mr. Kringle does obsess about the house decorating contest. I have three favorite quotes from this one. One is the above ""Cheese can smile?"" There's Malick's ""In the town of crazy, you're the mayor!"" (Guess who she was talking to?) And then there's the family dinner where the families were debating the where and what and who of the wedding, and a Kringle remarks: ""Rabbi? I don't think that's going to work. Henry isn't circumcised."" Oh, yeah, that's uncomfortable.Huh. It just hit me that, of these two, His and Her Christmas may be the more family appropriate movie, if you're planning on watching these with the ankle-biters. For those wondering, yes, there is some sexual innuendo in Will You Merry Me?",4,a dusting off of that old newsroom rivalry and the horror house of Christmas,1387843200,"12 24,

Dina Meyer is one of my favorites (Birds of Prey) and she does a fantastic job.  Her character is impassioned, messy, and delightful all at once--a perfect balance against her co-star.  I'm keeping this disk (the set comes in two disks) and will definitely watch it again.  The story is a good one and makes for a Hallmark style family watching.  I really liked how both of them had to learn to step outside of their comfort zones and decide to change their lives--that they had used their aloneness as shields from hurt, but that they had to learn how to let it go in order to really start living again.The other show, Will You Merry Me, was an okay watch--I won't keep that disk though as it wasn't anywhere as good as the other movie.

The interaction between both characters (the two reporters from the rival newspapers) was shallow and felt implausible.
