1238456,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B001U6YIAQ,Byron Kolln,"[2, 2]","After co-starring in 1955's ""The Tall Men"", Clark Gable and Jane Russell (along with her husband) formed their own company, Gabco (in association with Russ-Field Productions).  Jane Russell's ""The Revolt of Mamie Stover"" was one of the first features under the Gabco banner, closely followed by Clark Gable's THE KING AND FOUR QUEENS in 1956.In THE KING AND FOUR QUEENS (directed by Raoul Walsh), Gable plays con-man Dan Kehoe, who learns of a fortune in gold buried by the four outlaw McDade brothers--three have been killed whilst the fourth is still missing.  The treasure is guarded by the brothers' gun-toting mother (Jo Van Fleet) and her four daughters-in-law.  Determined to keep everything in order until the surviving brother returns, Ma has forced all four McDade wives to remain at the family property.  When Dan arrives to stake his own claim on the McDade gold, the girls (led by Eleanor Parker, Barbara Nichols, Jean Willes and Sara Shane) provide a perfect distraction...To be honest, the main reason why I picked up this disc was because of Eleanor Parker.  Funnily enough this is the third western starring Parker that I've reviewed in the last few weeks (following ""Escape from Fort Bravo"" and ""Many Rivers to Cross"").  Whilst she's top-billed with Clark Gable in the credits and delivers fine work, her role is only slightly larger than the other three women.  In truth, the biggest part goes to Jo Van Fleet as the crusty old mother; she won the Academy Award that same year for her performance as James Dean's mother in ""East of Eden"".The DVD is bare-bones (there isn't even a menu!), but the anamorphic print is in great shape with little damage.",4,unusual western comedy with Gable and Parker,1247356800,"07 12, 2009",2009,1669,"['co-starring', '1955', 'Tall', 'Men', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'Jane', 'Russell', 'husband', 'formed', 'own', 'company', 'Gabco', 'association', 'Russ-Field', 'Productions', 'Jane', 'Russell', 'Revolt', 'Mamie', 'Stover', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'features', 'Gabco', 'banner', 'closely', 'followed', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'THE', 'KING', 'AND', 'FOUR', 'QUEENS', '1956.In', 'THE', 'KING', 'AND', 'FOUR', 'QUEENS', 'directed', 'Raoul', 'Walsh', 'Gable', 'plays', 'con-man', 'Dan', 'Kehoe', 'who', 'fortune', 'gold', 'buried', 'four', 'outlaw', 'McDade', 'brothers', 'three', 'have', 'been', 'killed', 'fourth', 'still', 'missing', 'treasure', 'guarded', 'brothers', 'gun-toting', 'mother', 'Jo', 'Van', 'Fleet', 'four', 'daughters-in-law', 'Determined', 'keep', 'everything', 'order', 'surviving', 'brother', 'returns', 'Ma', 'forced', 'four', 'McDade', 'wives', 'remain', 'family', 'property', 'When', 'Dan', 'stake', 'own', 'claim', 'McDade', 'gold', 'girls', 'led', 'Eleanor', 'Parker', 'Barbara', 'Nichols', 'Jean', 'Willes', 'Sara', 'Shane', 'provide', 'perfect', 'distraction', 'be', 'honest', 'main', 'reason', 'why', 'picked', 'up', 'disc', 'was', 'Eleanor', 'Parker', 'Funnily', 'enough', 'third', 'western', 'starring', 'Parker', ""'ve"", 'reviewed', 'last', 'few', 'weeks', 'following', 'Escape', 'Fort', 'Bravo', 'Many', 'Rivers', 'Cross', 'Whilst', 'top-billed', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'credits', 'delivers', 'fine', 'work', 'role', 'only', 'slightly', 'larger', 'other', 'three', 'women', 'truth', 'biggest', 'part', 'Jo', 'Van', 'Fleet', 'crusty', 'old', 'mother', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'same', 'year', 'performance', 'James', 'Dean', 'mother', 'East', 'Eden', '.The', 'DVD', 'bare-bones', ""n't"", 'even', 'menu', 'anamorphic', 'print', 'great', 'shape', 'little', 'damage']",N/A

1238458,A144BX2IT6AQAL,B001U6YIAQ,Desdimona,"[1, 4]","This movie is why Hollywood cannot be trusted.  I feel so cheated watching this.  I kept watching because the movie kind of toys with you that it's not as bad as it is.  And you believe it until the end and then it's, ""I just got had.""  I love Clark Gable and was hoping to find him in a good role here.  Not to be.  I read reviews like this one printed on the box from The Hollywood Reporter, ""A fascinating production...Gable is at his most romantic and dashing.""  How much did The H Reporter get for lying like that?  First, this production is fascinating all right, it's fascinating how many times and ways the character Ma can say, ""I got 4 reasons I don't want you here mister,"" meaning the chastity of the 4 girls married to her MIA sons.  If you take out every one of these lines I don't think there is much dialogue left in the film!  In this way it is truly fascinating, although The HR review is certainly misleading in the way they state this fact!  How did this movie get made without somebody, anybody saying, ""Hey shouldn't we stop having Ma say that""?And as for Gable's romantic and dashing turns: no way!  He is so flat in this it's crazy, like he knew this film stunk and was just going through the motions.  In one of the scenes when he is playing a pipe organ type instrument he is ""doing"" the classic Gable faces, like pursing his lips to the side and sucking them in a bit.  But he goes through the classic Gable facial expressions in such quick succession in this scene in particular, that it took me right out of the movie.  I thought, what is that supposed to mean?  He seems like he was trying to ""do"" his bit, but it appears Gable is acting by rote here.  As for the story, there really is none apart from, ""4 reasons I don't want you here mister.""  And for a movie that is supposed to be all about sexual tension, there is none.  How they managed to suck this film dry of sexual tension is also ""fascinating.""  To add to this, none of the characters stand out as decent people.  The problem with this set up is that you don't get invested in any of them.  On top of this the story is such a sad one.  But because this is a film made without art or serious intent, the sad story is not highlighted as being sad.  It's not unpacked.  The story is handled negligently and superficially, because I guess, it's supposed to be a comedy and not a serious film.  But as a result of the handling, at the end of the film you feel like the storytellers grasped you by the arm and needlessly and mindlessly drug you down an ugly road just for laughs and kicks.When I see a movie that stinks this bad I think of all the people in need in the world.  Dang.  Probably millions of dollars were spent making this, and it stinks.  It doesn't add an ounce of goodness, art, beauty, or finesse to the world.  All that wasted money might have gone somewhere else and done some good.  And then I paid someone for the pleasure of watching this.  Bummer.  Right up there with the most useless films out there.",1,Stinks Real Bad,1294704000,"01 11, 2011",2011,3013,"['movie', 'why', 'Hollywood', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'trusted', 'feel', 'so', 'cheated', 'watching', 'kept', 'watching', 'movie', 'kind', 'toys', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'believe', 'end', 'then', 'just', 'got', 'had', 'love', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'was', 'hoping', 'find', 'good', 'role', 'here', 'Not', 'be', 'read', 'reviews', 'one', 'printed', 'box', 'Hollywood', 'Reporter', 'fascinating', 'production', 'Gable', 'most', 'romantic', 'dashing', 'How', 'much', 'did', 'H', 'Reporter', 'get', 'lying', 'First', 'production', 'fascinating', 'all', 'right', 'fascinating', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'ways', 'character', 'Ma', 'can', 'say', 'got', '4', 'reasons', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'here', 'mister', 'meaning', 'chastity', '4', 'girls', 'married', 'MIA', 'sons', 'take', 'out', 'one', 'lines', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'much', 'dialogue', 'left', 'film', 'way', 'truly', 'fascinating', 'HR', 'review', 'certainly', 'misleading', 'way', 'state', 'fact', 'How', 'did', 'movie', 'get', 'made', 'somebody', 'anybody', 'saying', 'Hey', 'should', ""n't"", 'stop', 'having', 'Ma', 'say', 'Gable', 'romantic', 'dashing', 'turns', 'way', 'so', 'flat', 'crazy', 'knew', 'film', 'stunk', 'was', 'just', 'going', 'motions', 'one', 'scenes', 'when', 'playing', 'pipe', 'organ', 'type', 'instrument', 'doing', 'classic', 'Gable', 'pursing', 'lips', 'side', 'sucking', 'bit', 'classic', 'Gable', 'facial', 'expressions', 'such', 'quick', 'succession', 'scene', 'particular', 'took', 'right', 'movie', 'thought', 'what', 'supposed', 'mean', 'was', 'trying', 'do', 'bit', 'Gable', 'acting', 'rote', 'here', 'story', 'really', 'none', 'apart', '4', 'reasons', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'here', 'mister', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'sexual', 'tension', 'none', 'How', 'managed', 'suck', 'film', 'dry', 'sexual', 'tension', 'also', 'fascinating', 'add', 'none', 'characters', 'stand', 'out', 'decent', 'people', 'problem', 'set', 'up', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'invested', 'top', 'story', 'such', 'sad', 'one', 'film', 'made', 'art', 'serious', 'intent', 'sad', 'story', 'not', 'highlighted', 'being', 'sad', 'not', 'unpacked', 'story', 'handled', 'negligently', 'superficially', 'guess', 'supposed', 'be', 'comedy', 'not', 'serious', 'film', 'result', 'handling', 'end', 'film', 'feel', 'storytellers', 'grasped', 'arm', 'needlessly', 'mindlessly', 'drug', 'down', 'ugly', 'road', 'just', 'laughs', 'kicks.When', 'see', 'movie', 'bad', 'think', 'people', 'need', 'world', 'Dang', 'Probably', 'millions', 'dollars', 'were', 'spent', 'making', ""n't"", 'add', 'ounce', 'goodness', 'art', 'beauty', 'finesse', 'world', 'wasted', 'money', 'might', 'have', 'gone', 'somewhere', 'else', 'done', 'good', 'then', 'paid', 'someone', 'pleasure', 'watching', 'Bummer', 'Right', 'there', 'most', 'useless', 'films', 'there']",N/A

1238461,A27M15DFUPV1CK,B001U6YIAQ,peterfromkanata,"[21, 22]","Released in 1956, ""The King and Four Queens"" provided another role, tailor-made for the ""King of MGM"", Clark Gable. As the title suggests, Mr. Gable had four leading ladies in this western ( Eleanor Parker, Jean Willes, Barbara Nichols and Sara Shane ),and plenty of opportunity to turn on that famous Gable charm.Four young women had all married outlaws--three of these men, all brothers, are dead, but a fourth may still live. Somewhere on their property, $ 100,000 in gold lies buried, and they know that the husband who may still be alive will likely return to dig it up. Guarding the four women with a very itchy trigger finger is the mother of the outlaw brothers--Jo Van Fleet, giving us the best acting performance in the film. ""Ma"" also knows where the gold is buried.With the smell of gold drawing him like a moth to a flame, Mr. Gable's rascally character enters the women's property, only to be greeted by a bullet from Ms. Van Fleet's rifle ! Of course, over her objections, the four, lonely young women are only too pleased to nurse him back to health, where he is soon ""charming"" them all in turn.I like Clark Gable as much as any classic film buff, and Eleanor Parker is one of my favourite leading ladies. However, although the film is handsomely mounted, and directed by Raoul Walsh, I have to say I was disappointed. ""That's it ?"" I said to myself when it was over. The plot is pretty sparse--apart from the four women competing for our hero's attention under the disapproving eye of Ms. Van Fleet, it is pretty slow going. ""Frankly My Dears""--nothing much happens !The DVD has beautiful, widescreen colour--the sound what you would expect--there are no extras.I'm sure there are other viewers out there who will disagree with my negative comments, but this surely has to be one of Clark Gable's lesser films. My three star rating is largely based on the Gable charisma, Ms. Parker's attractiveness and Ms. Van Fleet's acting--otherwise, considering the talent involved, this one is quite routine.",3,Mr. Gable Meets His Match !,1243209600,"05 25, 2009",2009,2016,"['Released', '1956', 'King', 'Four', 'Queens', 'provided', 'role', 'tailor-made', 'King', 'MGM', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'title', 'Mr.', 'Gable', 'had', 'four', 'leading', 'ladies', 'western', 'Eleanor', 'Parker', 'Jean', 'Willes', 'Barbara', 'Nichols', 'Sara', 'Shane', 'plenty', 'opportunity', 'turn', 'famous', 'Gable', 'charm.Four', 'young', 'women', 'had', 'married', 'outlaws', 'three', 'men', 'brothers', 'are', 'dead', 'fourth', 'may', 'still', 'live', 'Somewhere', 'property', '100,000', 'gold', 'lies', 'buried', 'know', 'husband', 'who', 'may', 'still', 'be', 'alive', 'will', 'likely', 'return', 'dig', 'up', 'Guarding', 'four', 'women', 'very', 'itchy', 'trigger', 'finger', 'mother', 'outlaw', 'brothers', 'Jo', 'Van', 'Fleet', 'giving', 'best', 'acting', 'performance', 'film', 'Ma', 'also', 'where', 'gold', 'smell', 'gold', 'drawing', 'moth', 'flame', 'Mr.', 'Gable', 'rascally', 'character', 'enters', 'women', 'property', 'only', 'be', 'greeted', 'bullet', 'Ms.', 'Van', 'Fleet', 'rifle', 'course', 'objections', 'four', 'lonely', 'young', 'women', 'are', 'only', 'too', 'pleased', 'nurse', 'back', 'health', 'where', 'soon', 'charming', 'turn.I', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'as', 'much', 'classic', 'film', 'buff', 'Eleanor', 'Parker', 'one', 'favourite', 'leading', 'ladies', 'However', 'film', 'handsomely', 'mounted', 'directed', 'Raoul', 'Walsh', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'disappointed', 'said', 'when', 'was', 'over', 'plot', 'pretty', 'sparse', 'apart', 'four', 'women', 'competing', 'hero', 'attention', 'disapproving', 'eye', 'Ms.', 'Van', 'Fleet', 'pretty', 'slow', 'going', 'Frankly', 'My', 'Dears', 'nothing', 'much', 'DVD', 'beautiful', 'widescreen', 'colour', 'sound', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'are', 'extras.I', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'other', 'viewers', 'who', 'will', 'disagree', 'negative', 'comments', 'surely', 'be', 'one', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'lesser', 'films', 'three', 'star', 'rating', 'largely', 'based', 'Gable', 'charisma', 'Ms.', 'Parker', 'attractiveness', 'Ms.', 'Van', 'Fleet', 'acting', 'otherwise', 'considering', 'talent', 'involved', 'one', 'quite', 'routine']",N/A
