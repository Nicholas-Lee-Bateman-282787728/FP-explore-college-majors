The romance between Jane Seymour's Ethne and Beau Bridge's Harry is the key to the story here which is the way it should be. The story (of course) is also solid. However - this is DVD sports an iffy transfer that seems to have been taken from some shoddy elements. The sound also is iffy in parts. I love this movie though so I had no hesitation in picking up this DVD.,4,"Great movie, but poor transfer",1033689600,"10 4, 2002",2002,410,"['favorite', 'version', 'book', 'romance', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'Ethne', 'Beau', 'Bridge', 'Harry', 'key', 'story', 'here', 'way', 'should', 'be', 'story', 'course', 'also', 'solid', 'However', 'DVD', 'sports', 'iffy', 'transfer', 'have', 'been', 'taken', 'shoddy', 'elements', 'sound', 'also', 'iffy', 'parts', 'love', 'movie', 'so', 'had', 'hesitation', 'picking', 'up', 'DVD']",N/A

Mason novel, it is nonetheless superior in terms of casting and storytelling.  The strength of the casting is self-explanatory.  As for the storytelling, it is more straightforward and stays closer to the focus of the novel - a young man trying to prove his courage to others after evading the call of duty.  Whereas the recent theatrical adaptation goes off into tangents, such as showing audiences the harshness of the Sudanese slave trade and desert climate, this TV movie takes these realities as a given and prefers to concentrate on the European characters instead of the African ones.  I personally prefer this TV movie because it gives much more attention to the relationship between a proud soldierly father and a son who never wanted to follow the family tradition.  In sum, a simple but effective visual treatment of a basically simple story of bravery, romance, and coming of age.However, the DVD has less than ten tracks, picture quality that is not really enhanced, and some rather poor sound quality.  I watched the DVD with headphones and heard slight hissing that one would expect from a dated VHS recording.  For these technical reasons, I can't give full stars to this DVD recording.",4,simple is better,1041465600,"01 2, 2003",2003,1324,"['modest', 'TV', 'movie', 'big', 'budget', 'huge', 'numbers', 'make', 'up', '2002', 'cinematic', 'version', 'A.E.W', 'Mason', 'novel', 'nonetheless', 'superior', 'terms', 'casting', 'storytelling', 'strength', 'casting', 'self-explanatory', 'storytelling', 'more', 'straightforward', 'closer', 'focus', 'novel', 'young', 'man', 'trying', 'prove', 'courage', 'others', 'evading', 'call', 'duty', 'recent', 'theatrical', 'adaptation', 'off', 'tangents', 'such', 'showing', 'audiences', 'harshness', 'Sudanese', 'slave', 'trade', 'desert', 'climate', 'TV', 'movie', 'realities', 'given', 'prefers', 'concentrate', 'European', 'characters', 'instead', 'African', 'ones', 'personally', 'prefer', 'TV', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'attention', 'relationship', 'proud', 'soldierly', 'father', 'son', 'who', 'never', 'wanted', 'follow', 'family', 'tradition', 'sum', 'simple', 'effective', 'visual', 'treatment', 'basically', 'simple', 'story', 'bravery', 'romance', 'coming', 'age.However', 'DVD', 'less', 'ten', 'tracks', 'picture', 'quality', 'not', 'really', 'enhanced', 'rather', 'poor', 'sound', 'quality', 'watched', 'DVD', 'headphones', 'heard', 'slight', 'hissing', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'dated', 'VHS', 'recording', 'technical', 'reasons', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'full', 'stars', 'DVD', 'recording']",N/A
710915,AYZLXLVMJGTJV,B00006BSD8,L. J Nary,"[1, 8]","The story line was interesting and intriquing at first but than it became to predictable. It also seems a bit far fetched that each man that gave him the white feathers, for what they took as pure cowardice, were all in such dire needs of rescue. How could he be there at the exact time they were in need and be the only one who could take over the feat of saving them from their eventual demise. The ending was to much of a predictablility. If I were the man, even if I am a woman, I don't think I would want to see the girl again, the girl he was in love with betrayed him and also gave him a white feather for cowardice. The one thing that I did get from the movie was how a parent can take something that a child finds interest in, being a soldier, setting up strategy for wartime, as witnessed in his childhood playtime, and making it seem inferior. He seemed to not be able to reward his child's imaginings but almost to compete with them. This in turn tainted the boys interest and replaced it with fear or negative energy. The movie only touched on this at the beginning and at the very end. This was what made the movie worthwhile to me. Also I like Jane Seymore as an actress and she is quite beautiful in this film. Beau Bridges does a good job in his role, seemed different as compared to other films I have seen him in.",3,A bit to Predictable,1062892800,"09 7, 2003",2003,1332,"['story', 'line', 'was', 'interesting', 'intriquing', 'first', 'became', 'predictable', 'also', 'bit', 'far', 'fetched', 'man', 'gave', 'white', 'feathers', 'what', 'took', 'pure', 'cowardice', 'were', 'such', 'dire', 'needs', 'rescue', 'How', 'could', 'be', 'there', 'exact', 'time', 'were', 'need', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'could', 'take', 'over', 'feat', 'saving', 'eventual', 'demise', 'ending', 'was', 'much', 'predictablility', 'were', 'man', 'even', 'am', 'woman', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'want', 'see', 'girl', 'again', 'girl', 'was', 'love', 'betrayed', 'also', 'gave', 'white', 'feather', 'cowardice', 'one', 'thing', 'did', 'get', 'movie', 'was', 'how', 'parent', 'can', 'take', 'something', 'child', 'interest', 'being', 'soldier', 'setting', 'up', 'strategy', 'wartime', 'witnessed', 'childhood', 'playtime', 'making', 'seem', 'inferior', 'seemed', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'reward', 'child', 'imaginings', 'almost', 'compete', 'turn', 'tainted', 'boys', 'interest', 'replaced', 'fear', 'negative', 'energy', 'movie', 'only', 'touched', 'beginning', 'very', 'end', 'was', 'what', 'made', 'movie', 'worthwhile', 'Also', 'like', 'Jane', 'Seymore', 'actress', 'quite', 'beautiful', 'film', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'good', 'job', 'role', 'seemed', 'different', 'compared', 'other', 'films', 'have', 'seen']",N/A

710917,A2EWN4ANV3CPG6,B00006BSD8,Paul Sayles,"[10, 10]","This remake of the 1930s version of The Four Feathers remedies some of the deficiencies of the first film.Harry Faversham is a young officer tired of the military, having grown up in the army - his father is a general.  He is engaged to a woman who is also of the army, but more inclined to accept it.  This then is the basis of the story.  Two people, similar backgrounds, different goals.  He wants his children to grow up without the Army, she is impressed with a regimental wedding.War breaks out again in the Sudan and Harry is put to the test - does he stay with the Army.  However, before he can have his resignation accepted, a recall of officers occurrs and telegrams arrive at his engagement party demanding the return of Harry and his officer guests to the regiment.  Harry burns the telegrams and is seen by one officer.  When the officers discover what he has done, each of the three send him a white feather, a sign of cowardice.  His fiancee, when she sees this is at first outraged that they would do this, but when Harry tells her what he did, she adds her feather to the other three - making a total of four feathers.  The movie is the story of how Harry redeems his honor by giving the four feathers back to their senders, after an act of courage in each case.This movie has better role definition for some charecters that is missing in the '30s version.  The general, played by Harry Andrews is exceptional.  Jane Seymour as Ethney is also excellent as the woman who scorns a man for a percieved act of cowardice but doesn't see the inner turmoil he is suffering.  The three officers do well.  They give off the feeling of priviledged junior leaders common to the British Army through the years.Corners were cut by splicing footage from the 30s edition into the current film.  It is immediately apparent and detracts from the film under review.  It is clumsy and takes away from the quality of the film.Beau Bridges as Harry seems an odd choice.  Trying to be British, he doesn't come off as very convincing.  His acting is good but I think he is rather miscast in this film.This is a fairly good film. The acting is adequate and the film score is quite good.  If you've never seen the 30s version, this is a good start.  If you have seen the earlier work, this will be a bit of a disappointment over all.",3,Good treatment of the AEW Mason book,1041206400,"12 30, 2002",2002,2325,"['remake', '1930s', 'version', 'Four', 'Feathers', 'deficiencies', 'first', 'film.Harry', 'Faversham', 'young', 'officer', 'tired', 'military', 'having', 'grown', 'up', 'army', 'father', 'general', 'engaged', 'woman', 'who', 'also', 'army', 'more', 'inclined', 'accept', 'then', 'basis', 'story', 'Two', 'people', 'similar', 'backgrounds', 'different', 'goals', 'children', 'grow', 'up', 'Army', 'impressed', 'regimental', 'wedding.War', 'breaks', 'out', 'again', 'Sudan', 'Harry', 'put', 'test', 'stay', 'Army', 'However', 'can', 'have', 'resignation', 'accepted', 'recall', 'officers', 'occurrs', 'telegrams', 'arrive', 'engagement', 'party', 'demanding', 'return', 'Harry', 'officer', 'guests', 'regiment', 'Harry', 'telegrams', 'seen', 'one', 'officer', 'When', 'officers', 'discover', 'what', 'done', 'three', 'send', 'white', 'feather', 'sign', 'cowardice', 'fiancee', 'when', 'first', 'outraged', 'would', 'do', 'when', 'Harry', 'what', 'did', 'feather', 'other', 'three', 'making', 'total', 'four', 'feathers', 'movie', 'story', 'how', 'Harry', 'honor', 'giving', 'four', 'feathers', 'back', 'senders', 'act', 'courage', 'case.This', 'movie', 'better', 'role', 'definition', 'charecters', 'missing', ""'30s"", 'version', 'general', 'played', 'Harry', 'Andrews', 'exceptional', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'Ethney', 'also', 'excellent', 'woman', 'who', 'man', 'percieved', 'act', 'cowardice', ""n't"", 'see', 'inner', 'turmoil', 'suffering', 'three', 'officers', 'do', 'well', 'give', 'off', 'feeling', 'priviledged', 'junior', 'leaders', 'common', 'British', 'Army', 'years.Corners', 'were', 'cut', 'splicing', 'footage', '30s', 'edition', 'current', 'film', 'immediately', 'apparent', 'detracts', 'film', 'review', 'clumsy', 'away', 'quality', 'film.Beau', 'Bridges', 'Harry', 'odd', 'choice', 'Trying', 'be', 'British', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'very', 'convincing', 'acting', 'good', 'think', 'rather', 'miscast', 'film.This', 'fairly', 'good', 'film', 'acting', 'adequate', 'film', 'score', 'quite', 'good', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', '30s', 'version', 'good', 'start', 'have', 'seen', 'earlier', 'work', 'will', 'be', 'bit', 'disappointment']",N/A
