1333453,A1FMJJKSVQDDQ,B00393SG10,Eric S. Kim,"[5, 5]","So filmmakers from my home country decided to create a disaster film of their own. Here's the basic premise: we get to know the characters, they talk, they argue with each other, then BANG, a tidal wave hits! Sounds simple enough. But here's the problem. Korean cinema is known to be filled to the brim with melodrama, whether it be a romantic drama or a historical epic. Tidal Wave is also filled with sappy moments, but it's almost useless in this sort of film. The characters are unmemorable and unlikable: they're all bland, with no personality whatsoever. They're also cliche-ridden cardboard cutouts, making them very similar to the characters in The Poseidon Adventure, 2012, The Day After Tomorrow, etc. In the first half of the film, they're just interacting with each other, and there's nothing interesting about it. The only thing that gives this film a bit of a spark is the third act, in which a total of three tidal waves hit South Korea. Unfortunately, with the budget that the filmmakers went with, it's not as spectacular as one would assume it would be. The CGI effects are just mediocre, with situations that have been seen before in other disaster films. Nothing special. Nothing shocking.This film did have some decent and hilarious moments, but all in all, it just doesn't work even as a standard disaster film.Grade: 4.2/10",2,Fails to deliver what could have been a decent disaster film,1302998400,"04 17, 2011",2011,1346,"['So', 'filmmakers', 'home', 'country', 'decided', 'create', 'disaster', 'film', 'own', 'Here', 'basic', 'premise', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'talk', 'argue', 'other', 'then', 'BANG', 'tidal', 'wave', 'hits', 'simple', 'enough', 'here', 'problem', 'Korean', 'cinema', 'known', 'be', 'filled', 'brim', 'melodrama', 'be', 'romantic', 'drama', 'historical', 'epic', 'Tidal', 'Wave', 'also', 'filled', 'sappy', 'moments', 'almost', 'useless', 'sort', 'film', 'characters', 'are', 'unmemorable', 'unlikable', ""'re"", 'bland', 'personality', 'whatsoever', ""'re"", 'also', 'cliche-ridden', 'cardboard', 'cutouts', 'making', 'very', 'similar', 'characters', 'Poseidon', 'Adventure', '2012', 'Day', 'Tomorrow', 'etc', 'first', 'half', 'film', ""'re"", 'just', 'interacting', 'other', 'nothing', 'interesting', 'only', 'thing', 'film', 'bit', 'spark', 'third', 'act', 'total', 'three', 'tidal', 'waves', 'hit', 'South', 'Korea', 'Unfortunately', 'budget', 'filmmakers', 'went', 'not', 'as', 'spectacular', 'one', 'would', 'assume', 'would', 'be', 'CGI', 'effects', 'are', 'just', 'mediocre', 'situations', 'have', 'been', 'seen', 'other', 'disaster', 'films', 'Nothing', 'special', 'Nothing', 'shocking.This', 'film', 'did', 'have', 'decent', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'even', 'standard', 'disaster', 'film.Grade', '4.2/10']",N/A

From what I observed, the lead male character is an alcoholic and a major f*#% up. His son is supposed to be very smart, but is also a whiny brat. The boys ""uncle"" (friend? brother? Who knows?) is often smacking the kid around, just as the aforementioned male lead is often being smacked by his elderly mother. We're talking ""Three Stooges"" smacking here, folks. I guess it's supposed to be hilarious. There's also a psychotic female character who's messing around with a helicopter rescue worker. The rescue worker, in his first scene, is a bit of a klutz, when he almost drowns the girl who will become his stalker. Later on, he's all of a sudden the most heroic professional you ever saw. Go figure. There's a bunch of other characters, and it takes about an hour and 20 minutes until we finally get to the ""money shot"", of the tsunami starting.The resulting tsunami is incredibly well done. I love disaster films, and was completely satisfied with the finale of this movie. It's hard to imagine, however, that any of the characters survive what took place on the screen. But, what the heck, at least some of them did survive.My only complaint is that, two of my favorite characters in the movie didn't make it.I enjoyed this film, because it was so bizarre , but I don't think it would be everyone's cup of tea.

1333460,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B00393SG10,MadMacs,"[0, 0]","Not used to Korean storytelling - the delivery is quite offbeat. Not bad at all, in fact, quite the opposite. But the complex social structure and extreme melodrama is something one has to get used to; especially coming from a western perspective.Rented because I'm a fan of disaster flicks, I have to say that I thought this was miscategorized because it plays as a comedy for a fair portion of the film. And it's a really excellent comedy. For the first fifty minutes of the movie, which lays out the characters and their relationships to one another, I had an absolute blast! These folks are insanely funny, and perhaps that's the point. To display and reveal their humanity; that these weren't just victims-to-be.And that's what I mean by offbeat delivery - you don't expect a comedy to be the harbinger or platform to a terrible disaster. In western films the tone is infinitely more sombre, more serious with very light comedic touches, if at all; a wisecrack here or there is about it.In 'Tidal' we're introduced to a very large contingent of characters - we're talking more than dozen. But surprisingly, they don't congeal into an anonymous homogenized mass as one would expect, and you fairly quickly sort out the whos, whats and whys.The two primary characters are Man-sik and Yeon-hee.The former is one of the survivors of an open ocean tidal wave which killed a fellow fisherman. As ship's captain he was arrogant and negligent; ignoring the warnings of an older seasoned deckhand who reluctantly followed Man-sik's instructions. A decision that ended with him being crushed and trapped by a falling crab pot; unable to escape before the rogue wave struck and sank the craft. As he lay dying, moments before the wave engulfed the ship, the man makes a final request. He has Man-sik promise to look after his daughter, who will be alone in the world after his death.It's a promise Man-sik works hard to keep, but keep it he does. Under his guilt-driven watch, the young girl grows up to be a beautiful young woman. He's kept a protective eye on her, giving her extra money when she needs it and helping guide her way into a small business of her own.And despite his efforts to maintain a proper relationship, it's clear that Man-sik has fallen in love with Yeon-hee. A love that she also shares, but avoids because of his domineering mother; an old hag who detests her and her lowly lifestyle - selling her meager catch of fish on the sidewalk and running a tiny out-of-the-way restaurant in a bustling port/vacation city.What happens to Man-sik, Yeon-hee and the others is both terrifying and engrossing. The film's early light-heartedness creates a real connection to the characters as people; we don't want to see any of them hurt, even though you know some of them won't make it. The genuine empathy one feels is what really makes this a solid flick, regardless of the whipped up screeching melodrama. And there are still a few elementary sacred cows that Koreans have yet to slaughter. i.e. Inappropriate (independent) women ""getting their comeuppance""; the unfilial son who only respects his hard-working mother after her death, etc. Essentially, Koreans proselytising and overacting their values, sounding a lot like social propoganda.Still, the overall tone is enjoyable.A fun movie and one that I would recommend to film fans in general, but disaster groupies like myself in particular.Personal Note. One disturbing element that I had a huge problem with: Any country where dogs can be considered 'food' will obviously not be given the respect we in the west would consider acceptable behavior. But, drunk or not, you don't go around kicking our four-legged buddies. }:-(It's a deeply flawed character trait that I find personally detestable, but one I took in stride given my belief that cultural differences are also cultural tolerances.

1333462,AAW58LG72PG7I,B00393SG10,"Martin Asiner ""Adjunct College Instructor""","[0, 0]","Disaster movies are by their very nature driven by special effects.  The characters usually exist as props around which the disaster is laid.  In TIDAL WAVE, director Je Gyun does not deviate from this formula yet he manages to interweave three disparate genres: soap opera romance, pratfall comedy, and FX disaster. The plot is no different from the recent 2012; a geologist predicts a colossal tsunami will strike a major city in Korea.  When he tells his boss, he is told not to worry since Korea is in an ""earthquake free"" zone.  Besides, if the prediction is false, then heads will roll.  It is only with 10 minutes to go before the tsunami hits, that his boss is convinced to sound the alarm.  The result of what is essentially no warning is grimly predictable--the city is knocked flat with massive carnage and loss of life.  For fully the first three quarters of the film, the focus is only marginally on the efforts of the scientist to convince his superiors of the threat. What we get is a series of vignettes tht involve the love lives of three sets of characters.  The first involves the scientist who has fathered a child with a successful woman who refuses to acknowledge his paternity.  The second is a young woman who loves a clueless man who refuses to take a hint.  And the third is a teenage girl who throws herself at a lifeguard who can't believe that she really wants him.  These three romances are treated with a broad spectrum of hokey romance and pratfall comedy, but the characters are so likable that we are inclined to see them as multi-dimensional real people with real lives.  But this is a disaster film and as such the payoff is the special effects.  For those viewers who have seen cities inundated with sea surges, the results here are familar but still gripping since each incoming wave threatens the trio of lovers.  One does not often find a Jackie Chan type of pratfall comedy in this genre but there are numerous scenes of broad comedy such as where the hero has to duck falling storage bins with the grace of a lame duck. Those reviewers who panned TIDAL WAVE justly complained at the overly obvious tugging at the heart strings during moments of tragedy. Still, I personally did not mind this tugging because I learned to care for all concerned.  And in the final analysis, that is all that is needed to make any film worth the watching.",3,A Strange but Effective Blending of Genres,1281916800,"08 16, 2010",2010,2378,"['Disaster', 'movies', 'are', 'very', 'nature', 'driven', 'special', 'effects', 'characters', 'usually', 'exist', 'props', 'disaster', 'laid', 'TIDAL', 'WAVE', 'director', 'Je', 'Gyun', 'not', 'deviate', 'formula', 'yet', 'interweave', 'three', 'disparate', 'genres', 'soap', 'opera', 'romance', 'pratfall', 'comedy', 'FX', 'disaster', 'plot', 'different', 'recent', '2012', 'geologist', 'colossal', 'tsunami', 'will', 'strike', 'major', 'city', 'Korea', 'When', 'boss', 'told', 'not', 'worry', 'Korea', 'earthquake', 'free', 'zone', 'prediction', 'false', 'then', 'heads', 'will', 'roll', 'only', '10', 'minutes', 'go', 'tsunami', 'hits', 'boss', 'convinced', 'sound', 'alarm', 'result', 'what', 'essentially', 'warning', 'grimly', 'predictable', 'city', 'knocked', 'flat', 'massive', 'carnage', 'loss', 'life', 'fully', 'first', 'three', 'quarters', 'film', 'focus', 'only', 'marginally', 'efforts', 'scientist', 'convince', 'superiors', 'threat', 'What', 'get', 'series', 'vignettes', 'tht', 'involve', 'love', 'lives', 'three', 'sets', 'characters', 'first', 'scientist', 'who', 'fathered', 'child', 'successful', 'woman', 'who', 'acknowledge', 'paternity', 'second', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'clueless', 'man', 'who', 'take', 'hint', 'third', 'teenage', 'girl', 'who', 'lifeguard', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'really', 'three', 'romances', 'are', 'treated', 'broad', 'spectrum', 'hokey', 'romance', 'pratfall', 'comedy', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'likable', 'are', 'inclined', 'see', 'multi-dimensional', 'real', 'people', 'real', 'lives', 'disaster', 'film', 'such', 'payoff', 'special', 'effects', 'viewers', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'cities', 'inundated', 'sea', 'surges', 'results', 'here', 'are', 'familar', 'still', 'gripping', 'incoming', 'wave', 'trio', 'lovers', 'One', 'not', 'often', 'find', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'type', 'pratfall', 'comedy', 'genre', 'are', 'numerous', 'scenes', 'broad', 'comedy', 'such', 'where', 'hero', 'duck', 'falling', 'storage', 'bins', 'grace', 'lame', 'duck', 'reviewers', 'who', 'panned', 'TIDAL', 'WAVE', 'justly', 'complained', 'overly', 'obvious', 'tugging', 'heart', 'strings', 'moments', 'tragedy', 'Still', 'personally', 'did', 'not', 'mind', 'tugging', 'learned', 'care', 'concerned', 'final', 'analysis', 'needed', 'make', 'film', 'watching']",N/A

1333465,A38RF06HMSYVLO,B00393SG10,"P. A. Clark ""P.A. Clark""","[10, 10]","More Drama than Natural Disaster. But still a good film.Tidal Wave uses the idea of a Tsunami to pit it's characters in a life and death struggle against nature. That being said, the first two thirds of the film are really more about charcater development.In the film Professor Kim, a marine geologist, discovers that a high magnitude earthquake is likely to occur off the shore of Haeundae.  There is reason to believe that if a high magnitude quake occurs, a small island off the coast will sink into the ocean causing a Tsunami.  However it's the peak season for vacationers in Haeundae, so his concerns are down played by his superiors who would prefer to see the season go on uninterrupted.As he moniters the earthquake situation, the film spends time developing several groups of characters.  They primarily live around the coastal area of Hameundae and are unaware of the impending Tsunami.  The characters vary in range. Yeon Hee is one of the main female characters whose father died in the 2004 Tsunami.  Her father's dying wish was that Man-Sik look after her.  Man-Sik is true to his word and looks after Yeon Hee as she runs her mediocre resturant. The two seem to have an attraction to one another, although Man-Sik is older than Yeon Hee and he seems to feel his role with her should be more of a guardian.  Yeon Hee would prefer him to become closer to her though. To make matters worse, Man Sik's mother does not seem to like Yeon Hee very much.Another set of interesting charcters are Kim-Yi Mi and CHoi Hyung- Sik.  Kim Mi is a universtiy student from Seoul vacationing in Haeundae. She comes from a wealthy family but falls off a ship and is rescued by Choi Hyung Sik, a marine rescue team member. The rescue goes a little poorly. However, Kim Mi seems to develope a crush on Choi even though they are seperated by a class difference. The plot with them developes humorously as she demands his attention and he is conflicted about whether they should be seeing each other.Finally we have Professor Kim and his ex-wife Yoo-Jin.  They share a daughter, but Yoo-Jin decides to keep her father's identity from her.  The two do not get along. They have seperate career paths, however, professor Kim seems interested in starting ties with his daughter when he meets her.With the character plots running we finally reach the earthquake which causes the Tsunami.  The waves are high and the destruction ensues. Haeundae is not ready for the Tsunami.  As a result, the characters fight for their lives.  Some do not make it. I won't spoil the ending for you.Well Tidal Wave was a good film.  It is a disaster film, but it does not use the disaster element to carry the story the whole way through.  The characters had plenty of deveopment time which is good. You feel a genuine concern for them when they run into trouble. The film is also very humorous considering it had a Tsunami rushing in on it at the end.The special effects are good. Some of the better effects I've seen in Korean cinema.  The action at the end can be tense but also manages to add sperts of humor.As for the tech aspects. The film has the original Korean language along with an English dubbed version.  It also has subtitles in English and Spanish. Deleted scenes, a gag reel, and a making of the film are also included as special features.  The English dub version is done fairly well. Although it does not have the same intensity as the origanal Korean language. Which is understandable since a dub actor is bringing their own interpertation while still trying to lip sinc. The film is still watchable in English though.Overall I gave the film a 4. Not for the Tsunami however.  I felt the character development was good and could have carried the film to the end.  The Tsunami just happens to come in the last 1/3 of the film and causes a whole new twist. This film may appeal to people who like natural disaster films, but I think it will also appeal to people who like asian cinema and dramas.  A good rental and a possible purchase is you like collecting well made Asain cinema films.",4,Korean Tsunami Disaster!,1275696000,"06 5, 2010",2010,4076,"['More', 'Drama', 'Natural', 'Disaster', 'still', 'good', 'film.Tidal', 'Wave', 'idea', 'Tsunami', 'pit', 'characters', 'life', 'death', 'struggle', 'nature', 'being', 'said', 'first', 'two', 'thirds', 'film', 'are', 'really', 'more', 'charcater', 'development.In', 'film', 'Professor', 'Kim', 'marine', 'geologist', 'discovers', 'high', 'magnitude', 'earthquake', 'likely', 'occur', 'off', 'shore', 'Haeundae', 'reason', 'believe', 'high', 'magnitude', 'quake', 'small', 'island', 'coast', 'will', 'sink', 'ocean', 'causing', 'Tsunami', 'However', 'peak', 'season', 'vacationers', 'Haeundae', 'concerns', 'are', 'down', 'played', 'superiors', 'who', 'would', 'prefer', 'see', 'season', 'go', 'uninterrupted.As', 'earthquake', 'situation', 'film', 'time', 'developing', 'several', 'groups', 'characters', 'primarily', 'live', 'coastal', 'area', 'Hameundae', 'are', 'unaware', 'impending', 'Tsunami', 'characters', 'vary', 'range', 'Yeon', 'Hee', 'one', 'main', 'female', 'characters', 'father', 'died', '2004', 'Tsunami', 'father', 'dying', 'wish', 'was', 'Man-Sik', 'look', 'Man-Sik', 'true', 'word', 'Yeon', 'Hee', 'mediocre', 'resturant', 'two', 'seem', 'have', 'attraction', 'one', 'Man-Sik', 'older', 'Yeon', 'Hee', 'feel', 'role', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'guardian', 'Yeon', 'Hee', 'would', 'prefer', 'become', 'closer', 'though', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'Man', 'Sik', 'mother', 'not', 'seem', 'like', 'Yeon', 'Hee', 'very', 'much.Another', 'set', 'interesting', 'charcters', 'are', 'Kim-Yi', 'Mi', 'CHoi', 'Hyung-', 'Sik', 'Kim', 'Mi', 'universtiy', 'student', 'Seoul', 'vacationing', 'Haeundae', 'wealthy', 'family', 'off', 'ship', 'rescued', 'Choi', 'Hyung', 'Sik', 'marine', 'rescue', 'team', 'member', 'rescue', 'little', 'poorly', 'However', 'Kim', 'Mi', 'develope', 'crush', 'Choi', 'even', 'are', 'seperated', 'class', 'difference', 'plot', 'humorously', 'attention', 'conflicted', 'should', 'be', 'seeing', 'other.Finally', 'have', 'Professor', 'Kim', 'ex-wife', 'Yoo-Jin', 'share', 'daughter', 'Yoo-Jin', 'keep', 'father', 'identity', 'two', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'along', 'have', 'seperate', 'career', 'paths', 'however', 'professor', 'Kim', 'interested', 'starting', 'ties', 'daughter', 'when', 'character', 'plots', 'running', 'finally', 'reach', 'earthquake', 'Tsunami', 'waves', 'are', 'high', 'destruction', 'ensues', 'Haeundae', 'not', 'ready', 'Tsunami', 'result', 'characters', 'fight', 'lives', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'ending', 'you.Well', 'Tidal', 'Wave', 'was', 'good', 'film', 'disaster', 'film', 'not', 'use', 'disaster', 'element', 'carry', 'story', 'whole', 'way', 'characters', 'had', 'plenty', 'deveopment', 'time', 'good', 'feel', 'genuine', 'concern', 'when', 'run', 'trouble', 'film', 'also', 'very', 'humorous', 'considering', 'had', 'Tsunami', 'rushing', 'end.The', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'good', 'better', 'effects', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Korean', 'cinema', 'action', 'end', 'can', 'be', 'tense', 'also', 'add', 'sperts', 'humor.As', 'tech', 'aspects', 'film', 'original', 'Korean', 'language', 'along', 'English', 'dubbed', 'version', 'also', 'subtitles', 'English', 'Spanish', 'Deleted', 'scenes', 'gag', 'reel', 'making', 'film', 'are', 'also', 'included', 'special', 'features', 'English', 'dub', 'version', 'done', 'fairly', 'well', 'not', 'have', 'same', 'intensity', 'origanal', 'Korean', 'language', 'Which', 'understandable', 'dub', 'actor', 'bringing', 'own', 'interpertation', 'still', 'trying', 'lip', 'sinc', 'film', 'still', 'watchable', 'English', 'though.Overall', 'gave', 'film', '4', 'Not', 'Tsunami', 'however', 'felt', 'character', 'development', 'was', 'good', 'could', 'have', 'carried', 'film', 'end', 'Tsunami', 'just', 'come', 'last', '1/3', 'film', 'whole', 'new', 'twist', 'film', 'may', 'appeal', 'people', 'who', 'natural', 'disaster', 'films', 'think', 'will', 'also', 'appeal', 'people', 'who', 'like', 'asian', 'cinema', 'dramas', 'good', 'rental', 'possible', 'purchase', 'collecting', 'well', 'made', 'Asain', 'cinema', 'films']",N/A

I caught this film as a rental and found it extremely entertaining.  What's really odd about ""Tidal Wave"" though is that it mashes together two completely and wildly different genres.  Does it work?  Well...not really, but it's still pretty darn entertaining.  For the first three quarters of the movie ""Tidal Wave"" is a laugh out loud over the top comedy with almost ridiculous slap stick humor.  For the last quarter of the film-it turns into a super serious disaster movie with a ton of human drama.  Because of the earlier slapstick, it's hard to really take the drama too seriously and I think that's kind of a shame since what we're seeing on screen is horrifying (and a little too reminiscent of news footage of Japan's recent earthquake/tsunami tragedy).  Though the mash up of genres seems like a real misdirection to me in tone-I couldn't help but be entertained by both the ridiculous and the serious in equal measure.  I would definitely watch this film again-both for the goofy comedy bits as well as the somber scenes of epic disaster.

The remainder of the film features destruction and devastation, as the city is hit by several tsunami waves of incredible size.  Somewhat unusual to a Western audience, the film is kind of a soap opera, followed by a special effects heavy disaster.The drama portion, should mostly be understandable to Westerners, however the Asian cultural quirks and sense of humor, may be something of an acquired taste.  A scientist attempting to warn the authorities about the possible strike of a ""mega-tsunami"" is all too familiar.  However, the idea that the potential threat of a tsunami is something new, is quite silly.It's a long wait for the waves, but when the surf is finally up, the special effects are not bad, and may include some things you have not seen before, like a cargo ship stuck on a suspension bridge.  Not everything is convincing, such as some scenes at sea, which may not even be accurate, as tsunamis usually do not rise to great heights, until they approach a land mass.The extensive preamble will try the patience of some viewers, as the movie could have been cut down, without seriously affecting its impact.  However, as anyone familiar with modern multipart Korean dramas can attest, extended stories concerning family life, with lots of seemingly unnecessary detail, are a well established form of entertainment in Korea.Although the melodramatic portion might wear you down, and few of the characters are very likeable, the special effects and destruction do provide some excitement at the end.  The English dubbing isn't always the greatest, and neither is some of the acting, but the movie does manage to have some touching and funny moments.

1333473,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00393SG10,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","""Tidal Wave"" is a sort of belated answer from the Korean film industry to the so-called disaster movie genre that once flourished in the 1970s. If you remember such films as ""The Poseidon Adventure"" or ""Airport"" (or ""Airport 75"" ""77"" or ""79"" if you like), you know I am trying to say. Clearly inspired by the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, ""Tidal Wave"" tries hard to dazzle us with the huge tsunami wall, but the film succeeds more in creating soapy, melodramatic stories.The film's premise itself is simple. Set in Haeundae Beach, popular resort beach in eastern Busan, ""Tidal Wave"" follows a group of ordinary people including a seismologist Dr. Kim (Joong-Hoon Park). The doctor warns that a tsunami will hit the beautiful coast of Haeundae, but no one listens. His ex-wife Lee Yu-jin (Jeong-hwa Eom), too busy preparing for the upcoming international conference, just ignores him, leaving their only daughter in a hotel room.The ensemble stories include a former fisherman Choi Man-shik (Kyung-gu Sol), and Gang Yeon-heui (Ji-won Ha), whose dead father was working with Man-shik when the Indian Ocaen tsunami hit their boat. There are sub-plots about a shy coast guard Hyeong-shik (Min-gi Lee) and a young sassy girl from Seoul Hee-mee (Ye-won Kang), and a slacker Dong-chun (In-kwon Kim). Halfway through the film a devastating tsunami arrives, making for emotionally charged conclusion for each of them.If you expect the special effects of Hollywood blockbuster films like ""2012,"" sorry, you don't have one. The CGI-created tsunami sequences are at best passable, far cry from Roland Emmerich. I don't know much about the plausibility of mega-tsunami, but the digitally-painted tidal waves (and the buildings destroyed by them, which strongly remind us of ""Deep Impact"") do not look convincing.""Tidal Wave"" is an unashamed tearjerker wearing its big heart on its sleeve, and it works as such.
