On the brink of severing ties with both his wife and his longtime partner, an L.A.P.D. officer instead winds up trapped with them as death closes in. That's the plot to Sean Cain's Silent Night, Zombie Night.Robin Pierce of Gorezone Magazine saying that Sean Cain has outromeroed George Romero with Silent Night, Zombie Night--I don't think so. Why? Well- there's very little zombie chaos. It centers more on the drama of a love triangle(two policemen & the wife they both love) than it does on what's going on around them. Not only that but, other than the fact it takes place during the holiday season and Santa appears as a walker, it really makes no sense to call this movie what it is called.Course, if you can get past all the B.S. and whatnot, it was an ok & decent watch. However, like Devil's Playground, I can only recommend a rental, at best. Buying this is such a complete waste.

Most of the movie deals with the relationship/triangle of three people: two police officers, and a wife they both love (while the rest of the world goes to pot).  Somehow, I can't quite believe survival would be put on hold so that three people could endlessly yap about their dysfunctional friendships.  I expect zombies in a zombie movie, not a handful of folks hiding in a house as they discuss a failed marriage and a partnership about to be dissolved.  It also didn't help that the lead character Frank (Jack Forcinito) is thoroughly repugnant and difficult to watch.  No wonder his wife and his partner want to leave him, the guy is a creep.The tone of this movie was totally from a soap opera standpoint, with a few zombies tossed into the background.

1442439,A1L7IMLGPF72GG,B0055CP9AY,Howard M. Kindel,"[6, 6]","Not a literal see-saw of course: a figurative one.  This movie challenged my willingness to accept almost anything simply because it's a zombie movie.  Therein lies the ""see-saw"": it was a bad movie, it was a good movie, then a bad movie, then a good, then...and so forth.  I started out thinking ok, the acting really is bad; but it got better, and better, until by the end it was quite good.  And the two main characters fit right in with the good movie-bad movie paradigm - they were cops, and literally one seemed like a good cop, the other like a bad cop.  Unfortunately - especially for them - they ended their assignment being a couple of jerks whose bravado nearly got them killed.  In fact, the absolutely absurd macho excess at the end was exactly what proved the undoing of the male heroes of ""Doghouse"" (another offbeat but thoroughly engaging zombie movie).Not to fault the zombies for any of this, though.  They did everything expected of zombies - with one interesting twist: there were two kinds, one the passive zombies who spend most of their time walking aimlessly about; the other attack zombies who spent all of their time stalking normal humans and even planning strategies of attack.  There was even a virtual first for a zombie movie: a poignant character, who took a moment from trying to survive to lament the unfairness of the zombie assault.  His son had been bitten and, instead of trying to deny the boy's growing zombification, had shot him to keep him from becoming a zombie himself.Through it all, the heroine - the bad cop's wife, who also loved the good cop, who loved her back, which affected their primary focus - remained closer than anyone else to the central theme.  So much so, in fact, that at the end when given the grisly task of undoing the inevitable result of the cops' using up all their bullets to have fun with the attack zombie instead of killing him outright, she was up to the task.  Score one for feminism.UPDATE: After having watched ""Devil's Playground"" - a genuinely great zombie film - I can't in good conscience give ""Silent Night, Zombie Night"" four stars, so I changed it to three stars.",3,Zombies On A See-Saw,1334102400,"04 11, 2012",2012,2148,"['Not', 'literal', 'see-saw', 'course', 'figurative', 'one', 'movie', 'challenged', 'willingness', 'accept', 'almost', 'anything', 'simply', 'zombie', 'movie', 'Therein', 'see-saw', 'was', 'bad', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'then', 'bad', 'movie', 'then', 'good', 'then', 'so', 'forth', 'started', 'out', 'thinking', 'ok', 'acting', 'really', 'bad', 'got', 'better', 'better', 'end', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'fit', 'right', 'good', 'movie-bad', 'movie', 'paradigm', 'were', 'cops', 'literally', 'one', 'seemed', 'good', 'cop', 'other', 'bad', 'cop', 'Unfortunately', 'especially', 'ended', 'assignment', 'being', 'couple', 'jerks', 'bravado', 'nearly', 'got', 'killed', 'fact', 'absolutely', 'absurd', 'macho', 'excess', 'end', 'was', 'exactly', 'what', 'proved', 'undoing', 'male', 'heroes', 'Doghouse', 'offbeat', 'thoroughly', 'engaging', 'zombie', 'movie', '.Not', 'fault', 'zombies', 'though', 'did', 'everything', 'expected', 'zombies', 'one', 'interesting', 'twist', 'were', 'two', 'kinds', 'one', 'passive', 'zombies', 'who', 'spend', 'most', 'time', 'walking', 'aimlessly', 'other', 'attack', 'zombies', 'who', 'spent', 'time', 'stalking', 'normal', 'humans', 'even', 'planning', 'strategies', 'attack', 'was', 'even', 'virtual', 'first', 'zombie', 'movie', 'poignant', 'character', 'who', 'took', 'moment', 'trying', 'survive', 'lament', 'unfairness', 'zombie', 'assault', 'son', 'had', 'been', 'bitten', 'instead', 'trying', 'deny', 'boy', 'growing', 'zombification', 'had', 'shot', 'keep', 'becoming', 'zombie', 'heroine', 'bad', 'cop', 'wife', 'who', 'also', 'loved', 'good', 'cop', 'who', 'loved', 'back', 'affected', 'primary', 'focus', 'remained', 'closer', 'anyone', 'else', 'central', 'theme', 'So', 'much', 'fact', 'end', 'when', 'given', 'grisly', 'task', 'undoing', 'inevitable', 'result', 'cops', 'using', 'up', 'bullets', 'have', 'fun', 'attack', 'zombie', 'instead', 'killing', 'outright', 'was', 'up', 'task', 'one', 'feminism.UPDATE', 'having', 'watched', 'Devil', 'Playground', 'genuinely', 'great', 'zombie', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'good', 'conscience', 'give', 'Silent', 'Night', 'Zombie', 'Night', 'four', 'stars', 'changed', 'three', 'stars']",Silent Night: Zombie Night

Unfortunately, the film takes itself way too seriously.  The beginning takes off like the proverbial rocket with excellent quick cutting opening scenes.  The zombies are respectable (make up done well) and the gore effects are very believable.  Then suddenly, the film jars you to a near-slow motion stop with a mediocre storyline about a romantic triangle (???) that definitely isosceles'es the zombies leaving them with the short side of the story.  By the way, the cover is misleading as the wife never handles a single weapon (save a club in the beginning) for the whole film and obviously serves no purpose other than token prize to be protected.  This could've been an awesome Christmas movie (zombie elves, zombified reindeer, hell even a zombie Santa), but the motif is barely explored with the one lone Santa that shambles across the screen.  There was even an opportunity to exploit an original idea:  I don't recall the alpha zombie idea ever being used.  This could've really become something but instead again, the asinine romantic angle had to play out instead.
