This movie is unfortunately in a line of commercial gay films that titilate more than mentally or emotionally stimulate. The acting itself was not bad in itself, but the preponderance of substance abuse gives us the idea that all gay youth struggling for identity and acceptance turn to drugs for their journey to self-acceptance. The softcore pron in the movie was pleasant enough but was out of place for me. There are times when showing less is more creative and stimulating than showing it all.

859448,A9Y947FCJZPVL,B00064AFFA,Arcadio Bolaos,"[1, 2]","Inspired by Bruce La Bruce's short stories, Tom Palmer's daring film ventures into a world of male prostitution, heavy drugs and depravation.In the first minute of ""Sugar"" 18-year-old Cliff, the protagonist, stares at a boy kissing his girlfriend. Cliff is there as a voyeur, as his presence irrupts the intimacy of a couple, but he is also there to acquire the necessary visual stimulation to masturbate afterwards. Regarded from the very beginning, the order of the phantasm mediates the relationship between the protagonist and his world.And what world is that? There is the nice house with the white picket fences which conforms reality and there is also the real, which Cliff encounters as he heads downtown and arrives in a place in which prostitution, she-males and drugs are the norm; why is that the 'real'? Because it exceeds and surpasses reality, but at the same time is excrementitiously derived from that reality. It is in this environment that he meets a handsome hustler named Butch.If, according to Lacan, the desire comes from the real as it cannot be fully articulated or tamed by language, then it's understandable that Cliff will bond with Butch through the phantasm. What are the implications? That he doesn't know anything about this male prostitute, and yet he is very attracted to him. Deep inside, Cliff trusts in the possibility of a successful relationship with Butch. But is it possible to maintain a healthy rapport with someone whose motivations remain unclear? Butch considers himself an actor, after all, he has to reenact the fantasies of his clients. He seems to specialize in seriously disturbed individuals that have banned themselves from normal pleasure and instead aim subconsciously for their particular phantasms (the abusive father, the strong macho, the hockey player, etc.). According to Freud not all libido can be transferred into the image, there are limits. The recognition of ourselves and our bodies, in which conscious knowledge is modeled, bears great limitations, because something eludes this primitive libidinal investment that shapes the image of the ideal ego; there is a portion of libido that cannot be transferred into the image, neither in the image of my body nor in the image of my partner, remaining instead invested at the level of one's own body in a non-specular way, avoiding the laws of representation. When Butch's clients rely entirely on this young man to relive their fantasies they fail at obtaining pleasure, because as Freud explains, they're trying to put all their libido in an image, in a specular representation of their past which obviously doesn't work in the present.Perhaps dominated by the real, the clandestine world of drugs and illegal activities, Butch has no option but to keep doing the things he knows how to do best. Cliff's mistake, however, is to enter into this ambit of the real, turning his back on a more familiar (and familial) reality. Cliff sleeps with his friend in the same bed, but they do not touch each other. They masturbate in front of each other, but they do not have sex. Cliff fills the void in his life, his lack of a loving partner, with the phantasm of something that's clearly not there. But what happens when Butch gets violent and crosses the line? Somehow, adopting the phantasm is easy, but when Cliff finds himself occupying the role of the 'object a', when he finds himself turning into Butch's phantasm, an already feeble relationship starts to unravel.",4,"""Whose sexual fantasy am I reenacting?""",1318032000,"10 8, 2011",2011,3477,"['Inspired', 'Bruce', 'La', 'Bruce', 'short', 'stories', 'Tom', 'Palmer', 'daring', 'film', 'ventures', 'world', 'male', 'prostitution', 'heavy', 'drugs', 'depravation.In', 'first', 'minute', 'Sugar', '18-year-old', 'Cliff', 'protagonist', 'boy', 'kissing', 'girlfriend', 'Cliff', 'there', 'voyeur', 'presence', 'intimacy', 'couple', 'also', 'there', 'acquire', 'necessary', 'visual', 'stimulation', 'masturbate', 'afterwards', 'Regarded', 'very', 'beginning', 'order', 'phantasm', 'relationship', 'protagonist', 'world.And', 'what', 'world', 'nice', 'house', 'white', 'picket', 'fences', 'conforms', 'reality', 'also', 'real', 'Cliff', 'downtown', 'place', 'prostitution', 'she-males', 'drugs', 'are', 'norm', 'why', ""'real"", 'reality', 'same', 'time', 'excrementitiously', 'derived', 'reality', 'environment', 'handsome', 'hustler', 'named', 'Butch.If', 'according', 'Lacan', 'desire', 'real', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'fully', 'articulated', 'tamed', 'language', 'then', 'understandable', 'Cliff', 'will', 'bond', 'Butch', 'phantasm', 'What', 'are', 'implications', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'male', 'prostitute', 'yet', 'very', 'attracted', 'Deep', 'Cliff', 'possibility', 'successful', 'relationship', 'Butch', 'possible', 'maintain', 'healthy', 'rapport', 'someone', 'motivations', 'remain', 'unclear', 'Butch', 'actor', 'reenact', 'fantasies', 'clients', 'specialize', 'seriously', 'disturbed', 'individuals', 'have', 'banned', 'normal', 'pleasure', 'instead', 'aim', 'subconsciously', 'particular', 'phantasms', 'abusive', 'father', 'strong', 'macho', 'hockey', 'player', 'etc.', 'According', 'Freud', 'not', 'libido', 'can', 'be', 'transferred', 'image', 'are', 'limits', 'recognition', 'ourselves', 'bodies', 'conscious', 'knowledge', 'modeled', 'great', 'limitations', 'something', 'eludes', 'primitive', 'libidinal', 'investment', 'image', 'ideal', 'ego', 'portion', 'libido', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'transferred', 'image', 'image', 'body', 'image', 'partner', 'remaining', 'instead', 'invested', 'level', 'one', 'own', 'body', 'non-specular', 'way', 'avoiding', 'laws', 'representation', 'When', 'Butch', 'clients', 'rely', 'entirely', 'young', 'man', 'relive', 'fantasies', 'fail', 'obtaining', 'pleasure', 'Freud', ""'re"", 'trying', 'put', 'libido', 'image', 'specular', 'representation', 'past', 'obviously', ""n't"", 'work', 'present.Perhaps', 'dominated', 'real', 'clandestine', 'world', 'drugs', 'illegal', 'activities', 'Butch', 'option', 'keep', 'doing', 'things', 'how', 'do', 'best', 'Cliff', 'mistake', 'however', 'enter', 'ambit', 'real', 'turning', 'back', 'more', 'familiar', 'familial', 'reality', 'Cliff', 'friend', 'same', 'bed', 'do', 'not', 'touch', 'other', 'masturbate', 'front', 'other', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'sex', 'Cliff', 'void', 'life', 'lack', 'loving', 'partner', 'phantasm', 'something', 'clearly', 'not', 'there', 'what', 'when', 'Butch', 'violent', 'line', 'Somehow', 'adopting', 'phantasm', 'easy', 'when', 'Cliff', 'occupying', 'role', ""'object"", 'when', 'turning', 'Butch', 'phantasm', 'already', 'feeble', 'relationship', 'unravel']",Sugar

Somehow through the director John Palmer, or the writer the storyline blurs from coming of age, to the dangers of drugs to the grimy life of a prostitute.

However, even with the three actors helping float this mess, the script is to riddled with unbelievable holes...Cliff leaving his safe suburban area and heads directly to the sketchiest part of a city or finding a street hustler that wants to be your friend even if you don't pay him (to mention a few) .

The story is centered around Cliff (Andre Noble) but it is Fehr's acting that really gets the viewers attention.  This film is definitely not for the squeamish.  From scenes of sex with an unattractive, overweight disabled woman to a scene where Butch basically rapes Cliff for the benefit of a voyeuristic trick, the movie doesn't shy away from uncomfortable material.  Most of the movie, however, just didn't work for me.  The role of Cliff's mother wasn't very interesting  and I found the little sister, Cookie, who pill-popped Ritalin and dispensed joints like candy to be a little creepy.

Viewers are drawn into the monotomy of leads who are pining for love, struggling with acceptance and deal with tragic coming out stories but most of the time these tales seem to wrap things up nice and neatly in the end with our heroes finding love, triumphing over diversity and finding love and acceptance in some way.This is not that movie and for some that is a bitter pill to swallow, but for some of us (who have swallowed many a bitter pill in our time) this movie is more real than any of those others.Sugar is about falling in love with the bad boy and falling in with an unforgiving scene.

859456,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00064AFFA,Grady Harp,"[4, 5]","SUGAR is one of those films that polarizes audiences: there are those who loathe the 'bad rap' it presents of the gay underground life and there are those that are in the Bravo camps of the stars. Based on short stories by Bruce La Bruce, SUGAR takes a look at the dark side of male prostitution in Toronto, hustlers on drugs, warpy families (and lack of family), and the idiosyncrasies of johns.  And if these topics present a problem to viewers, then this is probably not a film to recommend.However, for those who want a ground-level view of the world of male hustlers in Canada (and everywhere in the big cities around the world), then this script by Todd Klinck as directed by John Palmer rolls like a kaleidoscope of constantly changing aspects of this corner of society.Cliff (Andre Noble) is celebrating his 18th birthday watching and acting out on his sexual confusion.  His family consists of a mother (Marnie McPhail) who at least tries to be a supportive contemporary mom, and a bizarre sister Cookie (Haylee Wanstall) who requires Ritalin to maintain some semblance of normalcy while being very in tune with the 'world' Cliff is attempting to enter.After a birthday at home, Cliff wanders the streets of Toronto and accidentally (?) encounters a cruising site for gay hustlers, trannies, and prostitutes.  His flat affect is suddenly changed and the world that embraces his closeted gay bent opens up to him.  His eyes fall on one Butch (Brendan Fehr) and for the first time in his life he has physical contact with another person!  Butch is stunningly handsome, has a warm heart, flirts with Cliff yet warns him they cannot be anything but friends.  Cliff falls in love, follows Butch through his various johns, partakes in Butch's always expanding drug habit, and eventually is used in an encounter for one of Butch's tricks - an encounter that breaks Cliff's idealistic infatuation with a moment of reality.From that moment the film winds down with some tragic events permanently altering Cliff's view of the world and his place in it. Yes, the story has been used before, but this time along with the expected drug use extremes and deterioration of character, Palmer stalls at significant moments to share some of the sad pathology of various johns in an understanding light.  There is a lot of sensitivity with the collection of characters in this film and that is a breath of fresh air.The acting is generally high quality, especially from Brendan Fehr, Andre Noble, Haylee Wanstall, Marnie McPhail, and Sarah Polley.  Roles such as Butch and Cliff call for a great deal of courage on the part of actors.

Smart, younger, Ritalin-popping sister Cookie (Haylee Wanstall) gives him a helpful push to go out into the big city (Toronto) to find sex.  Emerging from the subway and riding his new skateboard, Cliff scoots off to a hustling district and catches the eye of one of the pros, Butch (Brendan Fehr), a drug-taker.  Virgin Cliff decides almost immediately that he wants a relationship with Butch and even brings him home after the first night's encounter.  The relationship has its ups and downs, but the audience gets to see Butch (and, to a lesser extent, Cliff) operate in the hustler world at a benignly kinky, more-than-vanilla, level but at less than the heights of depravity shown in ""Mandragora."" The two have a good chemistry, especially in the (shortened from the VHS version) breakfast and photo-discussing scenes.  Cliff wants romance, not hustling; Butch has some ambivalence toward Cliff.  The plot moves toward an inevitable result, followed by a twist at the end that shows where Cliff really is.Cliff and Butch show good skin and are both good lookers.  There are four hustler characters who show more.  It all seems realistic and fairly presented.I found the hustling side-stories the most interesting part of the movie. Butch, Cliff, and Cookie are the most memorably acted characters. The main love story seemed rushed at the beginning.  Although I would have liked a little more on Cliff's motivation, one can make enough sense of it all.

JD's was a queer punk-zine which thrived between 1985 and 1991 and here director John Palmer has taken these stories, moved it from the skinhead punk world to a more mainstream urban locale of male hustlers, prostitutes and crack addicts and tells the tale of a young man coming of age, in a gritty and unnerving way. This is a great little film with some outstanding performances all around and it's a nice change of pace from the more mainstream, sugar coated (no pun intended) gay films we generally are accustomed to. It's unfortunate that the lead actor, Andre Noble, at the young age of 25, passed away unexpectedly in September 2004. I'm sure he would have had a great career ahead of him.On the eve of his 18th birthday, Cliff (Andre Noble) has a lame, but rather touching dinner with his mom (Marnie McPhail) and his sister ""Cookie"" (Haylee Wanstall) at a local watering hole. It's not until they return home that Cliff gets a rather unexpected present from his sister, a joint, a tiny bottle of vodka and a card that instructs him to get SEX. So what's a boy to do? He heads downtown and finds himself drawn to a male hustler named ""Butch"" (Brendan Fehr). Butch lives in a world of crack addicts, transexuals, and prostitutes and Cliff has no qualms or reservations about any of them or becoming a part of their world. Cliff and Butch strike up a friendship and spend the night together plutonically, with Cliff wanting more and Butch struggling with his intimacy. Butch shows him life on the streets and Cliff shows him the other side by taking him home for dinner. Their friendship continues to blossom. Like a lost little puppy, Cliff stays with Butch through thick and thin and as the story unfolds the dark underside engulfs both of them. From obese tricks and pregnant drug dealers to pedarests and guys who like to be spanked, we're drawn in, much like Cliff, to Butch's way of life and can't seem to pull away. As the film progresses you never know what dark alley, twist, or turn is going to befall them and both of these young actors give some great performances I've seen in quite some time, as do the co-stars.

859464,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00064AFFA,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[17, 23]","I'm not really sure about the state of gay independent cinema.  Seriously.  Now there are plenty of ineffective low budget features across the board, but it just seems that the success stories in the gay indies are much more infrequent proportionally to the number of films being made.  I'm not quoting real life statistics, of course, this is just my perception.  What is equally interesting is that no matter how lacking some of these films may be in terms of accomplished filmmaking technique or logical storytelling, they are embraced by many.  It's as if we are still perpetuating the notion that any gay representation is better than none--and I just don't know if that's true any more.  Surely, gay cinema can aspire to greatness.  I understand that many of these films are done with no money and very limited means.  I sympathize.  But writing a compelling and believable screenplay?  That just takes creativity and talent--but for every great gay film, there are still 100 disasters!Which leads me to ""Sugar,"" a Canadian treat about the hustler life from John Palmer.  Ostensibly billed as some sort of a love story, this bizarrely uneven film could never convince me that anything real was at stake.  The characters are so inconsistent, the situations so false--what is supposed to have a gritty, hard edged feel just left me slightly amused (if I registered any emotion beyond shock).  Telling the coming-of-age story of a gay suburban teen, Cliff, ""Sugar"" sets up an odd family life.  Virginal Cliff is sent into the city by his young sister (and I mean elementary aged) for his 18th birthday.  The girl, who is addicted to Ritalin, provides Cliff with vodka and marijuana to make the trip more enjoyable.  His mother is never a strong parental figure, she's off at work (something unexplained having to do with cartons of chocolate) and/or completely indifferent--yet oddly accepting of her children's lack of sense.Cliff promptly heads off to hustler central, meets the love of his life, makes out immediately, spends the night with all the rent boys--including a naked party in a client's limo.  Cliff begins a romance/friendship in earnest with Butch--a surprisingly coherent and pleasant (when the story needs him to be) train wreck of a low-end escort.  Cliff yearns to join the hustler life--why not?  Everything is peaches and roses, however, until Butch does the unthinkable.  It's awful and so unexpected!  He has sex with Cliff in front of a client.  It's exactly what Cliff has been wanting (both in terms of the relationship and in advancing his new career), but somehow we're supposed to believe it's unforgivable (and that Cliff has remained chaste during his explorations).  The story gets even more ridiculous (I mean heartrending) as we get to the conclusion.  Cliff must face the consequences of the life he has chosen--and the film leaves us with one last parting message.  There's nothing that can't be solved by an anonymous hook-up in a restaurant bathroom.  Sweet.You know, the actors aren't bad.  Heck, this film even features Canadian indie fave Sarah Polley.  There's nudity, if that's what you're looking for.  The little sister is extremely funny--although her penchant for supplying drugs and alcohol is never explained.  If you find this a ""love"" story, bless you--but it's not for me.  Now, I've heard a few comparisons to other (more successful) hustler movies including Van Sant's ""My Own Private Idaho.""

No, he doesn't just read the words. I had no idea this guy had such chops.  If you know him from the Roswell TV series, you do NOT know him.

I cringe at comparing him to a young Johnny Depp, but if he keeps this up.... Its difficult to chew up the scenery without misstepping but he pulls it off in the final scenes which were so easy to get wrong.His co-star, charming Andre Noble (who died of accidental poisoning in the summer of 2004) is solid as well, and there is a surprisingly good performance from 11-yr. old Haylee Wanstall.This is the unrated version and there is much adult material here including frontal nudity, although not from either of the two leads. This is Fehr's best work to date. Clearly he deserves better material; what is amazing is the skill with which he created believability for his character. Taking this role was gutsy at many levels.

A DVD called Johns also sold here on AMAZON.com is far and away a better choice in this area.  Johns shares the same basic subject matter street hustlers who find what proves eventually to be traggic love.  Johns has low budget movie issues but overcomes them very creatively becoming very realistic in the process.  Johns is also a similiar story of street life shared by two friends complete with bitter sweet ending but Johns is a far better story told in far more effective interesting ways.I am not saying Sugar is bad it is just not entirely good especially for the money it costs.  Sugar at times is very good but thats the problem those times of greatness come between long stretches of vaccuous slow pacing, lame scenes talking about nothing and uninteresting unrelated or stupid overly simplistic plot points driven home with a sledge hammer.  Case in point the breakfast table scene where the two dudes have a spot of sexual fun, the camera remains pretty static changing scenes only barely during the goings on.A good movie would have used a dizzying series of different angle shots intermixed with fast cuts appropriate music scoring and sounds to bring a certain dynamism even sick humor to the event that would have left the audience tired as if they were drawn into the action.  Sugar turned what should have been a very exciting scene into a moment where any intelligent audience was hoping ok ok get it over with already can't cha.  Sugar never hits that place most movies get to that allows you to suspend beleif and dive headfirst into the plot of the picture.Just when you were getting into BELEIVING in Sugar the storyline would do something stupid that insulted your intellegence so totally that the little voice in your head that scans for UNREAL SITUATIONS screams out come on GIVE ME A BREAK FOR GOODNESS SAKE!  It was as if Sugar's writer could not think of how to fill in parts of the story line so he just threw anything in he could just to use up remaining film time.Examples of things that just did not work.  The talk at the breakfast table one the dialogue was so slowly paced it was deadly, two they were not talking about anything that really offered any insight about the characters. The conversation did NOT add any true demension to the storyline they were just empty words to just take up space.  Three the characters were not inspired or animated and did not really seem to truly like each other at any point in the picture.  Theirs seemed more a business relationship rather than being anything one could remotely call a loving relationship.Character development in the SUGAR is pretty much absent beyond the most obvious, banal and completely superficial aspects of life.  The little girl drug dealer was really off the wall and seems too worldly forced and unreal for her tender age.  The mom was not beleivable straddling the hip pot smoking mom and saintly june cleaver in perfect suburbia fence.  Everything in the movie might had worked if it were handled and developed with a deft skilled subtle hand in instead pure brutish force.I am mentally slow due to cognitive and other disabilities so I generally do not mind when a movie moves slowly but this movie crept along so slow its lack of any pacing irked even me.The thing I noticed most about this movie was it never made you like the characters, it never made you invest any part of yourself in any of the characters.  The movie did not in any way draw you in and make you forget you were watching DVD.  Unlike this DVD really good movies even low budget ones quickly grab and develop viewer interest as a means to transport audiences from mere passive watcher to interested third party for whom this drama is unfolding.The very best movies make you feel as if you are almost a part of its goings on and Sugar did none of the things great movies do.  A few of the sets were sparse and uninspired especially the ""sex watcher dude's apartment"".  He sat there a shallow empty unrealistic uninspired character saying next to nothing by a stark blank white  wall yet he lived in this posh tall tower of obviously upscale apartments and his home had NO sense of this rich mans personality or ego.  His apartment\condo gave no insight into what kind of man he was as such he like all the other charcters in Sugar clung to a one demensional quality as if it was a holy grail.I guess thats what I honestly did not like about sugar is with few exceptions the people and places in Sugar were so totally one demensional.  A movie is like an invitation to lose yourself in another world for a period of time and when a movie characters places and sounds lack the depth, power and emotion to carry you away the audience is left feeling cheated as is the case with Sugar.Why did I give Sugar three stars if it was so bad.  Sugar gets its three stars because the few places where the movie was done well it really shines.  It has like four really awesome scenes in it that come across as pretty real.  When Butch a street tough goes off on drugs and starts acting really zapped out that felt fairly real.  The two old freaky men talking felt sort of real.  The surealistic scenes of the corpse of Butch talking seemed real.  The sex scene with the morbidly obese lady while totally gross felt real and was funny too.  The sex betrayal scene between butch and his friend in the watcher dudes posh apartment felt sort of real.  Just like I say in my tag Sugar has a few legitimate high energy rush moments where everything comes together, it is really funny \ real and it works but most of the movie is slow plainfully plodding emptiness where the audience is thinking ok ok ok move on already.Honestly I gave the movie 3 stars because those few fast high points on the unrated version of this Sugar rock and are worth its price but in reality this Sugar is only SEMI-SWEET at best and by giving This Semi Sweet SUGAR three stars the Wolf of ALPHASPACE is being kind.",3,"Sugar's Title Define's It Well ""Sugar"" Offers A Short

859479,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B00064AFFA,Tommy Dooley,"[0, 0]","This is a coming of age story that is both comedic and yet full of tragedy. Based on a Bruce LaBruce short story it is set and made in downtown Toronto. The hero turns 18 and his sister gives him a bottle of vodka, a joint and instructions to get laid. Andre Noble (Cliff) does just that (he sadly dies shortly after the making of this film). He meets 'hustler' or more accurately 'rent boy' 'Butch' played by Brendan Fehr, who puts in an outstanding performance (and I dont mean on the night as those more smut minded readers might infer).They start a relationship of sorts and Butch meets the family and then starts taking Cliff to his regular tricks. All of this is fuelled by increasingly large numbers of narcotics which point toward a hedonistic lifestyle which belies that the need to block out the world is because you are not happy living in it.Following a voyeur inspired 'rape', their relationship comes apart and Butch spirals ever downward with tragic consequences. This is a tottally belivable film and all the parts are played with true conviction, I found it completely compelling and can only recommend it. Some excellent supporting actors too especially the rag tag whores and lady boys and drug dealers, so not really a 'family film' this.",4,Not Too Sweet,1303430400,"04 22, 2011",2011,1258,"['coming', 'age', 'story', 'comedic', 'yet', 'full', 'tragedy', 'Based', 'Bruce', 'LaBruce', 'short', 'story', 'set', 'made', 'downtown', 'Toronto', 'hero', '18', 'sister', 'bottle', 'vodka', 'joint', 'instructions', 'get', 'laid', 'Andre', 'Noble', 'Cliff', 'just', 'sadly', 'shortly', 'making', 'film', 'more', 'accurately', ""'rent"", 'boy', 'played', 'Brendan', 'Fehr', 'who', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'dont', 'mean', 'night', 'more', 'smut', 'minded', 'readers', 'might', 'infer', '.They', 'start', 'relationship', 'sorts', 'Butch', 'family', 'then', 'taking', 'Cliff', 'regular', 'tricks', 'fuelled', 'increasingly', 'large', 'numbers', 'narcotics', 'point', 'hedonistic', 'lifestyle', 'need', 'block', 'out', 'world', 'are', 'not', 'happy', 'living', 'it.Following', 'voyeur', 'inspired', ""'rape"", 'relationship', 'apart', 'Butch', 'spirals', 'ever', 'downward', 'tragic', 'consequences', 'tottally', 'belivable', 'film', 'parts', 'are', 'played', 'true', 'conviction', 'found', 'completely', 'compelling', 'can', 'only', 'recommend', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'actors', 'too', 'especially', 'rag', 'tag', 'whores', 'lady', 'boys', 'drug', 'dealers', 'not', 'really', ""'family"", 'film']",Sugar
