I can see there is more humor in watching him as well as listening.  The quality was good.  It didn't have a menu or scene selection which would have been nice.,5,Brother Dave at his best on stage,1221955200,"09 21, 2008",2008,258,"['have', 'listen', 'humor', 'many', 'years', 'Now', 'finally', 'see', 'what', 'act', 'looked', 'stage', 'can', 'see', 'more', 'humor', 'watching', 'as', 'well', 'listening', 'quality', 'was', 'good', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'menu', 'scene', 'selection', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice']",Brother Dave Gardner

The jokes are the same ones he has been telling since the 1950's and 60's.  A few come off nicely, but a better amount fall flat mostly because of the passing of time.  I think seeing it live would have made a great difference in perspective.",2,Dave grew old with the rest of us,1316995200,"09 26, 2011",2011,360,"['Dave', 'was', 'good', 'old', 'boy', 'back', 'time', 'time', 'caught', 'up', 'never', 'more', 'evident', 'DVD', 'jokes', 'are', 'same', 'ones', 'been', 'telling', '1950', '60', 'few', 'come', 'off', 'nicely', 'better', 'amount', 'fall', 'flat', 'mostly', 'passing', 'time', 'think', 'seeing', 'live', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'great', 'difference', 'perspective']",Brother Dave Gardner
