1081084,A3MKFGAXNZC12F,B000RE94LU,A Green,"[38, 41]","My husband is still new to yoga and not very flexible and this DVD is perfect for him. The poses are gentle, varied and easy to follow. He says he feels that my body has increased mobility.  The instruction is very clear and allows him to get into the poses in a non-rushed way. Even though I have been doing yoga for awhile, I also use this DVD from time to time because I like the instructions and flow and to reinforce some elements of my practice.It was also filmed on a beach, the scenary is gorgeous and is an added bonus.",5,A Great Stretch,1191456000,"10 4, 2007",2007,528,"['husband', 'still', 'new', 'yoga', 'not', 'very', 'flexible', 'DVD', 'perfect', 'poses', 'are', 'gentle', 'varied', 'easy', 'follow', 'body', 'increased', 'mobility', 'instruction', 'very', 'clear', 'get', 'poses', 'non-rushed', 'way', 'Even', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'yoga', 'awhile', 'also', 'use', 'DVD', 'time', 'time', 'like', 'instructions', 'flow', 'reinforce', 'elements', 'practice.It', 'was', 'also', 'filmed', 'beach', 'scenary', 'gorgeous', 'added', 'bonus']",Essential Yoga For Inflexible People
1081085,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B000RE94LU,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[93, 100]","Essential Yoga for Inflexible People is a DVD which offers a variety of beginning-level yoga practices.  These practices are designed for inflexible people in particular by providing various modifications of traditional yoga poses, including use of props such as a chair and a blanket.  The Main Menu of the DVD offers the following options:Short Routines--Learn the BasicsShort Routines--ContinuedExtended Routines--As You ProgressCreditsEach of the above options is broken up into practice sub-menus as described below.  The times are as listed on the DVD, but I have added my own comments.SHORT ROUTINES, BASICS*Sun Salutations with Chair (6m)--2 rounds of sun salutations performed at a slow, modified pace using a chair*Sun Salutations without Chair (7m)--2 rounds of slow sun salutations, still modified but without the chair*Standing Poses with Chair (25m)--despite the title, these postures DO NOT use a chair; rather, they are modified standing postures including mountain, triangle, warrior 2, and side stretch*Standing Poses with Chair II (14m)--this segment actually does use a chair, but only for a few postures; consists mainly of variations on intense side stretch poseSHORT ROUTINES, CONTINUED*Seated Poses (9m)--held seated postures including staff pose, cross-leg, cobbler's pose, and hero; a blanket is used*Forward Bends with Chair (15m)--chair is used to support hands/arms for both standing and seated forward bends; ends with reclined leg stretch using a strap*Beginning Back Bends (8m)--gentle variations of cobra pose*Yoga Twists with Chair (11m)--starts with twists seated on chair, then moves to floor for additional seated twists and reclined twistsAll of the practices in the final segment, Extended Routines, are made up of the the shorter segments from above; most of the practices add a 5-minute relaxation segment as well.EXTENDED ROUTINES*Extended Standing Postures (30m)--both standing segments from above*Legs (40m)--seated segment, forward bends, seated twists, and relaxation*AM Wake Up (45m)--seated segment, sun salutations w/chair, 1st standing segment, and relaxation*Spinal Work in 3 Dimensions (40m)--sun salutations w/o chair, forward bends, back bends, and twists*Stubborn Hamstrings (65m)--sun salutations w/chair, both standing segments, forward bends, relaxation*Full Routine (90m)--combines all of the aboveOverall, these practices are definitely appropriate for those with little pre-existing flexibility who are new to yoga.  Instructor Maggie Rhoades generally provides good voiceover cues.  However, she moves VERY slowly, often taking several minutes to set up a single pose.  Therefore, anyone with prior yoga experience may become easily bored by these practices, even those with limited flexibility.  Furthermore, although the practices are filmed against the beautiful backdrop of Half-Moon Bay in Antigua, the camera sometimes focuses too much on the scenery and not enough on Maggie, which may make this video challenging for those just starting out with yoga.  For a true beginner who is very flexible and looking for short, modified yoga practices, this DVD might work very well; I would recommended, but it would not be my first choice for either someone new to yoga or someone who is inflexible.",4,Useful video for intendend audience of beginning yoga practitioners,1196035200,"11 26, 2007",2007,3260,"['Essential', 'Yoga', 'Inflexible', 'People', 'DVD', 'variety', 'beginning-level', 'yoga', 'practices', 'practices', 'are', 'designed', 'inflexible', 'people', 'particular', 'providing', 'various', 'modifications', 'traditional', 'yoga', 'poses', 'including', 'use', 'props', 'such', 'chair', 'blanket', 'Main', 'Menu', 'DVD', 'following', 'options', 'Short', 'Routines', 'Learn', 'BasicsShort', 'Routines', 'ContinuedExtended', 'Routines', 'ProgressCreditsEach', 'above', 'options', 'broken', 'up', 'practice', 'sub-menus', 'described', 'times', 'are', 'listed', 'DVD', 'have', 'added', 'own', 'comments.SHORT', 'ROUTINES', 'BASICS*Sun', 'Salutations', 'Chair', '6m', '2', 'rounds', 'sun', 'salutations', 'performed', 'slow', 'modified', 'pace', 'using', 'chair*Sun', 'Salutations', 'Chair', '7m', '2', 'rounds', 'slow', 'sun', 'salutations', 'still', 'modified', 'chair*Standing', 'Chair', '25m', 'title', 'postures', 'DO', 'NOT', 'use', 'chair', 'rather', 'are', 'modified', 'standing', 'postures', 'including', 'mountain', 'triangle', 'warrior', '2', 'side', 'stretch*Standing', 'Chair', 'II', '14m', 'segment', 'actually', 'use', 'chair', 'only', 'few', 'postures', 'mainly', 'variations', 'intense', 'side', 'stretch', 'poseSHORT', 'ROUTINES', 'CONTINUED*Seated', 'Poses', '9m', 'held', 'seated', 'postures', 'including', 'staff', 'pose', 'cross-leg', 'cobbler', 'pose', 'hero', 'blanket', 'used*Forward', 'Bends', 'Chair', '15m', 'chair', 'used', 'support', 'hands/arms', 'standing', 'seated', 'forward', 'reclined', 'leg', 'stretch', 'using', 'strap*Beginning', 'Back', 'Bends', '8m', 'gentle', 'variations', 'cobra', 'pose*Yoga', 'Chair', '11m', 'twists', 'seated', 'chair', 'then', 'floor', 'additional', 'seated', 'twists', 'reclined', 'twistsAll', 'practices', 'final', 'segment', 'Extended', 'Routines', 'are', 'made', 'shorter', 'segments', 'most', 'practices', 'add', '5-minute', 'relaxation', 'segment', 'well.EXTENDED', 'ROUTINES*Extended', 'Standing', 'Postures', '30m', 'standing', 'segments', 'above*Legs', '40m', 'seated', 'segment', 'forward', 'seated', 'twists', 'relaxation*AM', 'Wake', 'Up', '45m', 'seated', 'segment', 'sun', 'salutations', 'w/chair', '1st', 'standing', 'segment', 'relaxation*Spinal', 'Work', '3', 'Dimensions', '40m', 'sun', 'salutations', 'w/o', 'chair', 'forward', 'back', 'twists*Stubborn', 'Hamstrings', '65m', 'sun', 'salutations', 'w/chair', 'standing', 'segments', 'forward', 'relaxation*Full', 'Routine', '90m', 'aboveOverall', 'practices', 'are', 'definitely', 'appropriate', 'little', 'pre-existing', 'flexibility', 'who', 'are', 'new', 'yoga', 'Instructor', 'Maggie', 'Rhoades', 'generally', 'good', 'voiceover', 'cues', 'However', 'VERY', 'slowly', 'often', 'taking', 'several', 'minutes', 'set', 'up', 'single', 'pose', 'Therefore', 'anyone', 'prior', 'yoga', 'experience', 'may', 'become', 'easily', 'bored', 'practices', 'even', 'limited', 'flexibility', 'Furthermore', 'practices', 'are', 'filmed', 'beautiful', 'backdrop', 'Half-Moon', 'Bay', 'Antigua', 'camera', 'too', 'much', 'scenery', 'not', 'enough', 'Maggie', 'may', 'make', 'video', 'challenging', 'just', 'starting', 'out', 'yoga', 'true', 'beginner', 'who', 'very', 'flexible', 'looking', 'short', 'modified', 'yoga', 'practices', 'DVD', 'might', 'work', 'very', 'well', 'would', 'recommended', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'first', 'choice', 'someone', 'new', 'yoga', 'someone', 'who', 'inflexible']",Essential Yoga For Inflexible People

I've tried a couple yoga videos and a couple classes, but their idea of inflexible was something that I am still not sure I can even work my way up to.  With this program I feel like I can actually do it and after only a few weeks I'm already seeing the improvements.

In fact, I didn't even play the dvd for eight months.  ;)  But when I did start doing just the five minute exercises every day it definitely helped with my bad knees which I have after decades of standing on a concrete floor for eight or more hours a day.  I was really surprised.  Some of the more advanced techniques are quite beyond me but it's a fun little ritual that I hope will become a daily, (in the evening) thing with me.  I actually enjoy it and after even a short practice, (I don't spend long at it at all) I feel refreshed and tingly.  I think I will look for other yoga dvds that are designed for chubby slackers like myself later on, but this one is great.  I think anyone starting out would find it helpful and especially calming and energizing.  Try this and see. The beautiful background of ocean waves and the simple narration really make this one good.  I feel more connected to my body now.",5,This video helped my knee pain in just a few days...,1399420800,"05 7, 2014",2014,947,"['started', 'out', 'very', 'very', 'slowly', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'play', 'dvd', 'eight', 'months', 'when', 'did', 'start', 'doing', 'just', 'five', 'minute', 'exercises', 'day', 'definitely', 'helped', 'bad', 'knees', 'have', 'decades', 'standing', 'concrete', 'floor', 'eight', 'more', 'hours', 'day', 'was', 'really', 'surprised', 'more', 'advanced', 'techniques', 'are', 'quite', 'fun', 'little', 'ritual', 'hope', 'will', 'become', 'daily', 'evening', 'thing', 'actually', 'enjoy', 'even', 'short', 'practice', 'do', ""n't"", 'spend', 'long', 'feel', 'refreshed', 'tingly', 'think', 'will', 'look', 'other', 'yoga', 'dvds', 'are', 'designed', 'chubby', 'slackers', 'later', 'one', 'great', 'think', 'anyone', 'starting', 'out', 'would', 'find', 'helpful', 'especially', 'calming', 'energizing', 'Try', 'see', 'beautiful', 'background', 'ocean', 'waves', 'simple', 'narration', 'really', 'make', 'one', 'good', 'feel', 'more', 'connected', 'body', 'now']",Essential Yoga For Inflexible People
