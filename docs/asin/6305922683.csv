I like the cast a lot and the story alone is funny to me, I happen to know people that have had similar situations happen to them. So with all that said I have always loved this move and love the soundtrack as well. Brian Hooks as well has always been a funny actor to me and E 40 is always excellent.The movie is all about a guy who just wants to do his time and get out to see his girl. So when his release day happens upon him he is excited to be expected. But his friend can't make it to pick him up [for female reasons] so he sends another guy to pick him up. After he picks him up they head off only to be stopped by the police. Thing is his friend that picked him up picked him up in a stolen car, so his friend starts a shoot out with the police. Since he was just released from jail he bails and goes on the run. The rest of the film follows him as a fugitive.Brian Hooks is wonderful in this film as I knew he would be since I am a fan of his. I have liked Brian since I first saw him in ""Phat Beach"". But it is E 40 who really surprised me here since I knew Brian would be great. 40 for those who don't know is a very successful rapper from Vallejo California. He is basically himself here in this film but it is funny to see him here. David Alan Grier is hilarious as a cop here and you will see why if you check it out. There are many more appearances in this film from people I am sure you would recognize.Written and directed by DJ Pooh with a great cast I have to say this is still one of my favorite flicks. I wouldn't say it is laugh out loud non stop funny for the average person but for fans of these types of comedies like me you will enjoy it. I do recommend picking this up along with the soundtrack as it has some great music on it including a great song by Canadian rapper Choclair called ""Lets Ride"". Any way I have always enjoyed this flick so I do recommend it if you like these types of flicks or any of the people involved.",5,LOVE IT STILL,1312156800,"08 1, 2011",2011,2064,"['3', 'STRIKESNow', 'people', 'usually', 'love', 'hate', 'movie', 'what', 'have', 'seen', 'am', 'one', 'cast', 'lot', 'story', 'alone', 'funny', 'happen', 'know', 'people', 'have', 'had', 'similar', 'situations', 'happen', 'So', 'said', 'have', 'always', 'loved', 'move', 'love', 'soundtrack', 'as', 'well', 'Brian', 'Hooks', 'as', 'well', 'always', 'been', 'funny', 'actor', 'E', '40', 'always', 'excellent.The', 'movie', 'guy', 'who', 'just', 'do', 'time', 'get', 'out', 'see', 'girl', 'So', 'when', 'release', 'day', 'excited', 'be', 'expected', 'friend', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'pick', 'up', '[', 'female', 'reasons', ']', 'so', 'guy', 'pick', 'up', 'up', 'head', 'only', 'be', 'stopped', 'police', 'Thing', 'friend', 'picked', 'up', 'picked', 'up', 'stolen', 'car', 'friend', 'shoot', 'police', 'was', 'just', 'released', 'jail', 'run', 'rest', 'film', 'fugitive.Brian', 'Hooks', 'wonderful', 'film', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'am', 'fan', 'have', 'liked', 'Brian', 'first', 'saw', 'Phat', 'Beach', 'E', '40', 'who', 'really', 'surprised', 'here', 'knew', 'Brian', 'would', 'be', 'great', '40', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'very', 'successful', 'rapper', 'Vallejo', 'California', 'basically', 'here', 'film', 'funny', 'see', 'here', 'David', 'Alan', 'Grier', 'hilarious', 'cop', 'here', 'will', 'see', 'why', 'check', 'out', 'are', 'many', 'more', 'appearances', 'film', 'people', 'am', 'sure', 'would', 'recognize.Written', 'directed', 'DJ', 'Pooh', 'great', 'cast', 'have', 'say', 'still', 'one', 'favorite', 'flicks', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'non', 'stop', 'funny', 'average', 'person', 'fans', 'types', 'comedies', 'will', 'enjoy', 'do', 'recommend', 'picking', 'up', 'along', 'soundtrack', 'great', 'music', 'including', 'great', 'song', 'Canadian', 'rapper', 'Choclair', 'called', 'Lets', 'Ride', 'way', 'have', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'flick', 'so', 'do', 'recommend', 'types', 'flicks', 'people', 'involved']",N/A

483258,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,6305922683,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Three Strikes (DJ Pooh, 2000)[originally posted 6Mar2000]Lesson one: never let the only person at the table neither of you has ever met choose the movie you're going to see that night. Lesson two: ""dinner and a movie"" these days must, by necessity, have the movie first. You can't plan a dinner to finish just around the time that movies start unless you make it yourself.Once upon a time there was a rapper and his DJ. The DJ had written a movie script, and the rapper wanted to to star in it. It came out about the same time as eighty-seven-and-a-half other movies starring rappers, and there wasn't really much to distinguish it save the presence of an up-and-coming comedian who later went on to superstardom. And I don't know whether Chris Tucker is the reason, or something else, but Friday--written by Pooh and starring Ice Cube-- became a cult hit. It's still almost impossible to rent, years later, and when it shows up on prime time television, it gets ratings good enough to put it in the top twenty or so for the week. This, of course, makes Pooh think ""hey, my movie must be better than the rest of them. Maybe I should try it again.""In one month, Pooh has had two movies pop up-- Next Friday, the sequel to Friday, and Three Strikes. Everyone and their brother has already panned the former, so I don't need to add my own thoughts. But I haven't seen any reviews of Three Strikes yet. So I still get to chime in.The story revolves around Robert Duncan (Brian Hooks), a two-time offender who gets out of prison and, thanks to a series of misadventures, finds himself in a shootout over a stolen car. Knowing that he's going to jail for good if the cops think he's involved in some way, he runs, and spends the rest of the movie on the run from the cops while trying to patch things up with his girlfriend (N'Bushe Wright), avoid the friends of the car thief/shooter he left in the lurch, and calm his dysfunctional family. The usual misadventures occur that one sees in a movie such as this.And that's the problem with this flick-- it's the usual, the usual, and more of the usual. Some funny stuff, because Pooh really is good at writing comedy, but for the most part a lot of talented comic cast members fall flat. David Alan Grier, as the primary on the Duncan case, falls flat in almost every scene. Vincent Schiavelli is completely forgettable as Duncan's parole officer, and David Leisure doesn't have enough screen time to really get his shtick into gear. These performances balance out the good stuff-- Wright, Faison Love as the all-too-likable bad guy, and Duncan's deadpan sidekick, played by... uhhhhhh... IMDB isn't listing most of the players here. D'oh!In any case, it might be worth a rental. If you're a DJ Pooh completist or just like staring at N'Bushe Wright. Otherwise, ignore it and let it slip into the well-deserved obscurity waiting for it. **",2,You're Out.,1377734400,"08 29, 2013",2013,2881,"['Three', 'Strikes', 'DJ', 'Pooh', '2000', '[', 'originally', 'posted', '6Mar2000', ']', 'Lesson', 'one', 'never', 'let', 'only', 'person', 'table', 'neither', 'ever', 'met', 'choose', 'movie', ""'re"", 'going', 'see', 'night', 'Lesson', 'two', 'dinner', 'movie', 'days', 'must', 'necessity', 'have', 'movie', 'first', 'ca', ""n't"", 'plan', 'dinner', 'finish', 'just', 'time', 'movies', 'start', 'make', 'yourself.Once', 'time', 'was', 'rapper', 'DJ', 'DJ', 'had', 'written', 'movie', 'script', 'rapper', 'wanted', 'star', 'came', 'out', 'same', 'time', 'eighty-seven-and-a-half', 'other', 'movies', 'starring', 'rappers', 'there', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'much', 'distinguish', 'save', 'presence', 'up-and-coming', 'comedian', 'who', 'later', 'went', 'superstardom', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Chris', 'Tucker', 'reason', 'something', 'else', 'Friday', 'written', 'Pooh', 'starring', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'became', 'cult', 'hit', 'still', 'almost', 'impossible', 'rent', 'years', 'later', 'when', 'up', 'prime', 'time', 'television', 'ratings', 'good', 'enough', 'put', 'top', 'twenty', 'so', 'week', 'course', 'Pooh', 'think', 'hey', 'movie', 'must', 'be', 'better', 'rest', 'Maybe', 'should', 'try', 'again', 'one', 'month', 'Pooh', 'had', 'two', 'movies', 'pop', 'up', 'Next', 'Friday', 'sequel', 'Friday', 'Three', 'Strikes', 'Everyone', 'brother', 'already', 'panned', 'former', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'add', 'own', 'thoughts', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'reviews', 'Three', 'Strikes', 'yet', 'still', 'get', 'chime', 'in.The', 'story', 'revolves', 'Robert', 'Duncan', 'Brian', 'Hooks', 'two-time', 'offender', 'who', 'prison', 'thanks', 'series', 'misadventures', 'shootout', 'stolen', 'car', 'Knowing', 'going', 'jail', 'good', 'cops', 'think', 'involved', 'way', 'rest', 'movie', 'run', 'cops', 'trying', 'patch', 'things', 'up', 'girlfriend', ""N'Bushe"", 'Wright', 'avoid', 'friends', 'car', 'thief/shooter', 'left', 'lurch', 'calm', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'usual', 'misadventures', 'occur', 'one', 'movie', 'such', 'this.And', 'problem', 'flick', 'usual', 'usual', 'more', 'usual', 'funny', 'stuff', 'Pooh', 'really', 'good', 'writing', 'comedy', 'most', 'part', 'lot', 'talented', 'comic', 'cast', 'members', 'fall', 'flat', 'David', 'Alan', 'Grier', 'primary', 'Duncan', 'case', 'flat', 'almost', 'scene', 'Vincent', 'Schiavelli', 'completely', 'forgettable', 'Duncan', 'parole', 'officer', 'David', 'Leisure', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'really', 'get', 'shtick', 'gear', 'performances', 'balance', 'good', 'stuff', 'Wright', 'Faison', 'Love', 'all-too-likable', 'bad', 'guy', 'Duncan', 'deadpan', 'sidekick', 'played', 'uhhhhhh', 'IMDB', ""n't"", 'listing', 'most', 'players', 'here', ""D'oh"", 'case', 'might', 'be', 'rental', ""'re"", 'DJ', 'Pooh', 'completist', 'just', 'staring', ""N'Bushe"", 'Wright', 'Otherwise', 'ignore', 'let', 'slip', 'well-deserved', 'obscurity', 'waiting', '**']",N/A

A screenplay full of stock characters and stock South Central jokes make a poor commentary on the California Justice System. In my three attempts to watch this movie all the way through I wound up turning it off around the thirty-minute mark each time.To make a story like this work, you have to feel for the main character. Unfortunately he has no good qualities. He makes no efforts to do anything worthwhile. Getting out of jail, he goes back to doing the same things that got him locked up. In his attempts to clear himself he spends most of the movie doing a bunch of unfunny things that are supposed to be funny. I just can't laugh at car chases and shootouts in the inner city when so many young men and women die this way in real life. I can't laugh about a man throwing his life away going in and out of the prison system. To me, that's not a comedy. It's a tragedy.
