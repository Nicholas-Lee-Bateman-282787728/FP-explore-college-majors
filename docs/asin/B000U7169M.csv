1093623,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000U7169M,Chris Pandolfi,"[5, 14]","It's very surprising that ""The Reaping"" doesn't work; religious messages have been notoriously well acquainted with the horror genre, and most of the time, it works quite well (""The Exorcist,"" ""The Omen,"" ""Frailty,"" the original ""Wicker Man,"" etc.). Maybe that's because they relied on both shock value and story for advancement. ""The Reaping"" certainly succeeds in being shocking, with plenty of pop out scares and a few well placed disturbing images. But in terms of story, something was seriously lacking. The events of this film make absolutely no sense, with one crucial plot device clashing against every other, turning it into a convoluted mess. This isn't a case of leaving with more questions than answers; you leave with no answers at all.The plot centers on Katherine Winter (Hilary Swank), a Louisiana State University professor. When not in class, she travels the world, using her scientific skills to debunk claims of miraculous events. She was once a devout Christian, but she lost her faith when her husband and daughter were murdered on an African missionary excursion. This clearly adds conflict to the story, as shown when a man named Doug (David Morrissey) seeks her assistance. Strange things have been happening in his hometown of Haven, namely the first plague of the Old Testament (a river turning into blood). Upon entering Haven and examining the river, Winter learns of Loren McConnell (AnnaSophia Robb), a young girl believed to be responsible for her brother's death. She's also believed to be a servant of Satan, which may account for the condition of the river.Winter is initially unwilling to accept anything the town believes; she's confident that she can find a scientific explanation for the river turning red. But then another biblical plague occurs. Then another. And another. And another. After a while it becomes obvious that something powerful is at work here, something that cannot be explained through science. This understandably leaves Winter unsure of anything anymore. Are the plagues actually religious phenomena, and is a young girl responsible for it all?That's about as much of the plot as I can describe; the last half of the film is wall-to-wall revelations, none of which I can give away. What I can say is that the revelations are confusing and nonsensical. There's a complicated subplot involving a satanic cult and birth order, with the first borns safe from harm and the second borns in danger, or something like that. There's also a brief performance by Stephen Rea as Father Costigan, a priest who was with Winter when her family was murdered. He knows that she's in danger because of an ancient prophecy that predates Christianity. What no one seems to know is why she needed to be involved at all; were it not for the fact that she's the main character, one would have a hard time explaining why the simple folk of Haven, Louisiana would need her. I can't elaborate on this, but I will say that the final plot twists are of no help.Apparently, this film was delayed, with an original release date of August 2006. I can't help but feel that such a long delay contributed to the mess it's currently in; it seemed as if important details were edited out in order to appease the studio execs, the MPAA, the test audiences, or any combination thereof. I can definitely say that the film's structure is bad, but I'm not sure I can say the same thing about the film in general. I obviously don't know this for sure, but I have a feeling that a well-edited director's cut would fix everything, or at least enough of it to make the events of the story much more understandable. When and if such a version of ""The Reaping"" comes to fruition, I'll recommend it. Until then, keep as far away from this film as possible; it's a disaster of biblical proportions.",2,A Plague on the Silver Screen,1175731200,"04 5, 2007",2007,3809,"['very', 'surprising', 'Reaping', ""n't"", 'work', 'religious', 'messages', 'have', 'been', 'notoriously', 'well', 'acquainted', 'horror', 'genre', 'most', 'time', 'quite', 'well', 'Exorcist', 'Omen', 'Frailty', 'original', 'Wicker', 'Man', 'etc.', 'relied', 'shock', 'value', 'story', 'advancement', 'Reaping', 'certainly', 'being', 'shocking', 'plenty', 'pop', 'scares', 'few', 'well', 'placed', 'disturbing', 'images', 'terms', 'story', 'something', 'was', 'seriously', 'lacking', 'events', 'film', 'make', 'absolutely', 'sense', 'one', 'crucial', 'plot', 'device', 'clashing', 'other', 'turning', 'convoluted', 'mess', ""n't"", 'case', 'leaving', 'more', 'questions', 'answers', 'leave', 'answers', 'all.The', 'plot', 'centers', 'Katherine', 'Winter', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'Louisiana', 'State', 'University', 'professor', 'When', 'not', 'class', 'world', 'using', 'scientific', 'skills', 'debunk', 'claims', 'miraculous', 'events', 'was', 'once', 'devout', 'Christian', 'lost', 'faith', 'when', 'husband', 'daughter', 'were', 'murdered', 'African', 'missionary', 'excursion', 'clearly', 'conflict', 'story', 'shown', 'when', 'man', 'named', 'Doug', 'David', 'Morrissey', 'assistance', 'Strange', 'things', 'have', 'been', 'happening', 'hometown', 'Haven', 'namely', 'first', 'plague', 'Old', 'Testament', 'river', 'turning', 'blood', 'entering', 'Haven', 'examining', 'river', 'Winter', 'Loren', 'McConnell', 'AnnaSophia', 'Robb', 'young', 'girl', 'believed', 'be', 'responsible', 'brother', 'death', 'also', 'believed', 'be', 'servant', 'Satan', 'may', 'account', 'condition', 'river.Winter', 'initially', 'unwilling', 'accept', 'anything', 'town', 'confident', 'can', 'find', 'scientific', 'explanation', 'river', 'turning', 'red', 'then', 'biblical', 'plague', 'occurs', 'Then', 'while', 'obvious', 'something', 'powerful', 'work', 'here', 'something', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'explained', 'science', 'understandably', 'Winter', 'unsure', 'anything', 'anymore', 'Are', 'plagues', 'actually', 'religious', 'phenomena', 'young', 'girl', 'responsible', 'about', 'as', 'much', 'plot', 'can', 'describe', 'last', 'half', 'film', 'wall-to-wall', 'revelations', 'none', 'can', 'give', 'away', 'What', 'can', 'say', 'revelations', 'are', 'confusing', 'nonsensical', 'complicated', 'subplot', 'involving', 'satanic', 'cult', 'birth', 'order', 'first', 'borns', 'safe', 'harm', 'second', 'borns', 'danger', 'something', 'also', 'brief', 'performance', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'Father', 'Costigan', 'priest', 'who', 'was', 'Winter', 'when', 'family', 'was', 'murdered', 'danger', 'ancient', 'prophecy', 'Christianity', 'What', 'one', 'know', 'why', 'needed', 'be', 'involved', 'were', 'not', 'fact', 'main', 'character', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'explaining', 'why', 'simple', 'folk', 'Haven', 'Louisiana', 'would', 'need', 'ca', ""n't"", 'elaborate', 'will', 'say', 'final', 'plot', 'twists', 'are', 'help.Apparently', 'film', 'was', 'delayed', 'original', 'release', 'date', 'August', '2006', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'long', 'delay', 'contributed', 'mess', 'currently', 'seemed', 'important', 'details', 'were', 'edited', 'out', 'order', 'appease', 'studio', 'execs', 'MPAA', 'test', 'audiences', 'combination', 'thereof', 'can', 'definitely', 'say', 'film', 'structure', 'bad', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'can', 'say', 'same', 'thing', 'film', 'general', 'obviously', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'sure', 'have', 'feeling', 'well-edited', 'director', 'cut', 'would', 'fix', 'everything', 'least', 'enough', 'make', 'events', 'story', 'much', 'more', 'understandable', 'When', 'such', 'version', 'Reaping', 'fruition', ""'ll"", 'recommend', 'then', 'keep', 'far', 'away', 'film', 'possible', 'disaster', 'biblical', 'proportions']",N/A

Swank had lost her faith when doing missionary work in the drought ravaged Sudan, as both her husband and daughter were killed by superstitious local tribesmen.Swank was summoned at the university by Doug Blackwell a teacher from the bible belt hamlet of Haven located in the bayous of Louisiana played by David Morrissey.  The water in the local river purportedly turned to blood and Morrissey came to Swank seeking her council and an explanation.  Swank ably assisted by Idris Elba playing Ben was soon confronted by plagues of frogs, dying livestock et al in the cursed town.  The explanation for these plagues were put at the feet of a 12 year old girl Loren played by AnnaSophia Robb.  According to the townfolk she was an incarnate of Satan himself.Using computer graphics which were incredible, in particular,as the town gets attacked by grasshoppers, the plagues continue.

(Before going further, it needs to be said that Swank is actually very pretty in this movie, the most feminine of her career, and the only real reason to watch The Reaping)  With anger and despair filling her heart, Winter spends her free time disproving religious-themed miracles.Next up is a small Louisiana bayou town and a collection of Biblical plagues, as the fish die in a river that looks like a giant batch of Koolaid, which eventually leads to the demise of the WB frog, and flies that are apparently reincarnated ninjas (you'll understand if you see it).  The anxiety of small-minded townfolk and a need to blame someone leads the yokels - especially a cartoonish mayor who looks like Colonel Sanders' morbidly obese cousin - to blame a young, swamp-dwelling girl based upon nothing more than the hearsay of a local busybody.Anyway, it's up to Winter to disprove the plagues and make rational decisions - even though it's clear that Swank didn't make one when she signed on for his movie.  Eventually she has to cross the line between the possibilities of a disapproving God wreaking havoc, and a mischevious Devil tricking local idiots who no doubt follow the same philosophical principles asThe Waterboy's momma.  All of this is mashed together with misfitting subplots of cults and child sacrifice and convoluted flashbacks, not to mention a pointless secondary minister who I hoped from the beginning would incur the nasty boils plague.With a boring, hokey ending, and a collection of uninteresting characters, the ""surprise"" plot-twist was spoiled.  When God eventually reigns down his judgement, I sincerely doubt it will be this boring.  Believable science behind the plagues is supported by a mesmerizing DVD-extra that explains how the events could have occurred, but there isn't really much in the actual movie's fear or horror department.  Unfortunately, it's completely stereotypical - the disbeliever's faith-restored moment takes place, the black sidekick dies before the end, and there is a painfully unnecessary set up for a sequel.

1093640,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B000U7169M,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[3, 4]","""The Reaping"" is supposed to be this year's entry into the horror/thriller/lost faith genre, but doesn't quite know where to go. Should it be just a horror flick? No. How about a ""lost faith"" story? Nope. But it does qualify for being a thriller, in my opinion. The Reaping is as formulaic as it may be; it's still fun to watch. Hilary Swank finally looks feminine despite portraying yet another fearless female. She plays Katherine Winter, an ex-woman of the cloth who turned her back on the Church after suffering personal tragedy, and now spends her time as a professor debunking miracles as myths.But she runs out of plausible explanations when what appears to be the Bible's Ten Plagues begin to afflict a small town and she is called there to help its citizens. They blame a young girl, Loren McConnell (played frighteningly well by AnnaSophia Robb), whom they accuse of having killed her brother in a river that has now turned into blood, the first plague. Katherine encounters her several times and has trouble getting into an objective frame of mind as she likens Loren, no matter how creepy looking she is, to her own daughter.During the time I was watching this I notice that some of the plagues could have used a scarier execution. Like, when the frogs fell out of the sky, they were only a few, and oddly, none fell on the characters, just around them. That would have been a perfect eww-gross opportunity. Also, with the frequent references to the eerie wind chimes that everyone in the town seemed to have, I kept expecting to see some connection in the end but it was unsatisfying a mere misdirection. Hilary Swank is a phenomenal actress, there is no question, and she deserves far greater than her role as Katherine Winter gives her to work with. David Morrissey, as Doug, is as bland as he was in 2006'sBasic Instinct 2 (Unrated, Extended Cut)And coming off of her wonderful recent performance inBridge to Terabithia (Widescreen Edition)Annasophia Robb has nothing at all to do but squint her eyes and look suspicious. The amount of dialogue she is given could be recited in full in the span of thirty seconds. It's a haphazard gimmick of a part that no child actor should be cursed with having to portray.Like Louisiana needed more problems after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, it gets ten Biblical plagues in The Reaping, a great-looking thriller that's all beauty and no brains. Director Stephen Hopkins, who's done some good work on television but mostly bad work in features, starts early and keeps the shocks coming thick and fast. The trouble is, they're all tricks of editing and sound effects - nothing shocking actually happens. The obvious intent is to unnerve viewers and keep them on edge, but it will have the opposite effect on some, building up their immunity instead.

1093643,AAU5MAMZRRR80,B000U7169M,John Milton,"[1, 1]","I have suggested before, maybe somewhat controversially, if you're looking for horror, you don't have to go any further than the Bible for inspiration. It is full of hellions, fallen angels, possessions, promiscuous women, brutal characters and my personal favourite horror sub-genre, the apocalypse.Everyone's familiar with the likes of: The Omen, Rosemary's Baby, The Wicker Man, John Carpenter's Prince of Darkness, The Prophecy; the list is endless and that's not even starting on the possession-type movies such as The Rite, The Last Exorcism of Emily Rose and the classic, The Exorcist.What I plumped for was The Reaping, a 2007 film starring Hilary Swank (Million Dollar Baby, The Resident, Buffy the Vampire Slayer), David Morrisey (Centurion, soon to be seen as The Governor in series 3 of The Walking Dead), Idris Elba (Prometheus, 28 Weeks Later, The Unborn), Stephen Rea (The Devil's Mercy, Underword Awakening, FeardotCom) and a nice turn from none other than Charley Brewster himself William Ragsdale (Fright Night).Being set in the bible belt of America added a nice touch of southern gothic. Having spent a little time in America's south, I found the portayal of southern stereotypes here a little excessive; but not entirely far off the mark. With regards performances, I found Morrisey's attempt at a southern drawl quite distracting which is in contrast to Idris Elba's American accent, which seems to improve with every film he's in. Swank copes well in the lead role and Rea has very little to do in his role. It is AnnaSophia Robb's portrayal of the creepy child at the centre of the events occurring at Haven which I found to be noteworthy.Be warned, there's LOTS of CGI. This may be forgivable since in the film, we see the Ten Plagues of Egypt visited upon a small town in the deep south. Rivers of blood, raining frogs, plagues of locusts, festering boils and sores, it's all here! However, I particularly didn't like the CG effects at the end which, to be honest, reminded me of an episode of Buffy. However, at the time of watching, The Reaping was five years old and I suppose should be given a little leeway.Overall, the set-up which sees missionary turned world renowned scientist Swank travelling around the world disproving ""miracles"" by revealing the scientific facts behind the phenomena is very well done but I cannot help but think this film lacked pace in parts and then, when I really wanted to see a little more, I was left unsatisfied. Moreover, you'd think it would be relatively easy to make a film about the ten plagues somewhat scary... but instead the movie is incredibly safe and mainstream, undoubtedly to get that R/15 rating in order to generate a greater return from ticket sales by making it accessible to a wider audience.It's not quite the holy horror hokum I was expecting but The Reaping was entertaining enough with the obligatory plot twists to keep me watching for the duration of its 100 minute running time; and I felt this was a decent change from the usual bible-based horror that is prevalent in the genre.",4,Enjoyable holy horror romp in the deep south,1356134400,"12 22, 2012",2012,3070,"['have', 'suggested', 'maybe', 'somewhat', 'controversially', ""'re"", 'looking', 'horror', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'go', 'further', 'Bible', 'inspiration', 'full', 'hellions', 'fallen', 'angels', 'possessions', 'promiscuous', 'women', 'brutal', 'characters', 'personal', 'favourite', 'horror', 'sub-genre', 'apocalypse.Everyone', 'familiar', 'likes', 'Omen', 'Rosemary', 'Baby', 'Wicker', 'Man', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'Prince', 'Darkness', 'Prophecy', 'list', 'endless', 'not', 'even', 'starting', 'possession-type', 'movies', 'such', 'Rite', 'Last', 'Exorcism', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'classic', 'Exorcist.What', 'plumped', 'was', 'Reaping', '2007', 'film', 'starring', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'Resident', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'David', 'Morrisey', 'Centurion', 'soon', 'be', 'seen', 'Governor', 'series', '3', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'Idris', 'Elba', 'Prometheus', '28', 'Weeks', 'Later', 'Unborn', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'Devil', 'Mercy', 'Underword', 'Awakening', 'FeardotCom', 'nice', 'turn', 'none', 'other', 'Charley', 'Brewster', 'William', 'Ragsdale', 'Fright', 'Night', '.Being', 'set', 'bible', 'belt', 'America', 'added', 'nice', 'touch', 'southern', 'gothic', 'Having', 'spent', 'little', 'time', 'America', 'south', 'found', 'portayal', 'southern', 'stereotypes', 'here', 'little', 'excessive', 'not', 'entirely', 'far', 'mark', 'regards', 'performances', 'found', 'Morrisey', 'attempt', 'southern', 'drawl', 'quite', 'distracting', 'contrast', 'Idris', 'Elba', 'American', 'accent', 'improve', 'film', 'Swank', 'well', 'lead', 'role', 'Rea', 'very', 'little', 'do', 'role', 'AnnaSophia', 'Robb', 'portrayal', 'creepy', 'child', 'centre', 'events', 'occurring', 'Haven', 'found', 'be', 'noteworthy.Be', 'warned', 'LOTS', 'CGI', 'may', 'be', 'forgivable', 'film', 'see', 'Ten', 'Plagues', 'Egypt', 'visited', 'small', 'town', 'deep', 'south', 'Rivers', 'blood', 'raining', 'frogs', 'plagues', 'locusts', 'festering', 'boils', 'sores', 'here', 'However', 'particularly', 'did', ""n't"", 'CG', 'effects', 'end', 'be', 'honest', 'reminded', 'episode', 'Buffy', 'However', 'time', 'watching', 'Reaping', 'was', 'five', 'years', 'old', 'suppose', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'little', 'leeway.Overall', 'set-up', 'missionary', 'turned', 'world', 'renowned', 'scientist', 'Swank', 'travelling', 'world', 'disproving', 'miracles', 'revealing', 'scientific', 'facts', 'phenomena', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'think', 'film', 'lacked', 'pace', 'parts', 'then', 'when', 'really', 'wanted', 'see', 'little', 'more', 'was', 'left', 'unsatisfied', 'Moreover', ""'d"", 'think', 'would', 'be', 'relatively', 'easy', 'make', 'film', 'ten', 'somewhat', 'scary', 'instead', 'movie', 'incredibly', 'safe', 'mainstream', 'undoubtedly', 'get', 'R/15', 'rating', 'order', 'generate', 'greater', 'return', 'ticket', 'sales', 'making', 'accessible', 'wider', 'audience.It', 'not', 'quite', 'holy', 'horror', 'hokum', 'was', 'expecting', 'Reaping', 'was', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'obligatory', 'plot', 'twists', 'keep', 'watching', 'duration', '100', 'minute', 'running', 'time', 'felt', 'was', 'decent', 'change', 'usual', 'bible-based', 'horror', 'prevalent', 'genre']",N/A

Well, it isn't that original, basically it could have been pawned off as a cable of the month movie seen on Cinemax, HBO, Showtime or some other obscure cable channel. Pretty much everything you see in this film has been done before to one extent or another, so there are no real surprises. You have your biblical references and town folk made up of Christy Christers referencing the bible. Turns out of course that the townsfolk have ""thumbed"" their noses at ""God"" and turned to the dark side (no, the dark side of the force), but rather pay homage to satin instead.It's not terribly interesting, and Hilary Swank (an actress who I like) is pretty much just in denial through the film until the end where it counts and discovers the little girl who was being demonized isn't actually an evil child at all, but an angel protected by God (so on and so fourth). This isn't a great film, and goes to show Hollywood again will virtually make a film out of almost anything.I was bored to an extent watching this because so much was a repeat of past films (and done better might I add). Nothing terribly original. I can't recommend this film; it was just far too dull. I've seen far worse, but this one was close to putting me into a coma.

Now she has been called to the small town of Haven where supposedly a young girl turned the local river into blood.  But no sooner does the investigation begin than frogs fall from the sky.  Soon more plagues manifest in the small community.  Many of the townsfolk feel it is the work of a young girl living in the swamp and that she should be eliminated.  But what is really going on and what role is Swank supposed to play?  Another minster who Swank is acquainted with thinks he may have the answer.As the film moves along it does a very good job of playing The Old Testament and keeping things on track.  But later when the new prophesy is brought in it gets a little muddled.  I found it interesting that it had to be stressed that the prophesy was older than Christ when they are reliving events far older.  Is magic at work?  Is it God?  The Devil?  Is faith required?

After more and more start to happen like frogs falling from the trees into the river she encounters a young girl. The girl runs and then she is told that the town thinks the girl killed her brother and is the reason for the plagues. Because of this the town believes they have to kill the girl to stop the plagues. Katherine undergoes a huge battle trying to decide if the girl is truly evil or the exact opposite. There is some good to this movie, the acting is really good and it has great picture and sound quality. Also it's a interesting story and it kept me interested to the end.What messes up The Reaping is the fact that it is not even a thriller. It does not scare you at all and it takes forever to get to a point that you know is coming. There were a few scenes where they were building you up for something scary and then it stops. Nothing happens, just on to the next bit of information. It really was like a prolonged TV mystery that couldn't be too scary. What scared me most was that I almost bought this movie instead of borrowing it. I only hope my friend can trade this in or something.

It's a run-of-the-mill plague-ridden spooker that's not that spooky at all.The story is set in the backwoods of Louisiana (a recent trend thanks to perks offered by the state film commission) where a former missionary-turned-LSU professor/skeptic/debunker (Swank) is called upon to investigate strange happenings in the tiny town of Haven.  With her student assistant in tow, Swank sets out to find scientific explanations for the plague-like occurrences in the small town.What she finds is a close-knit community who believes that all of their problems are the cause of a Satan-worshipping little girl (AnnaSophia Robb).  From there, Swank and company encounter more plagues while they try to put a stop to the Robb.  As the story plays out, however, Swank begins to question the members of the community as well as her once-lost faith.  Who should she believe?  Who can she trust?  And exactly what is that tenth plague again?Overall, this snoozer is a step above most SciFi channel flicks, but it probably would have had a better run if it was released directly to DVD instead of on the big screen.  As others have stated, the film's plot unravels as the conclusion gets near.

Hence, Swank's character along with the help of her partner are then able to debunk the ""religious phenomenon"". Then Swank's character along with her partner are called to the small town of Haven to solve a lot of inexplicable ""religious phenomenon"" that have the townsfolk upset. Just when you think that Swank's character along that of her partner are going to be able to debunk these ""religious phenomenon"" with scientific evidence, the complete reverse happens and we find that the ""religious phenomenon"" can not be debunked with scientific evidence.The Cons: The last 20 minutes of ""The Reaping"" was bad.

After all, even believing in nothing requires its own kind of faith.  Katherine Winter (Hilary Swank) is an ex-missionary, an ordained minister who lost her faith somewhere in the dreary hillocks of her troubled past.  Now she keeps her eyes in safer and saner (if not more clinical) pastures, spending her time as an LSU professor whose specialty is debunking myths and miracles.  She approaches her job with the grim satisfaction of an older brother telling his younger sibling that, no, Santa Claus is NOT real.Her services are soon required by a small town in New Orleans by the name of Haven (that's called ""irony,"" folks!).  It seems a local boy was recently killed.  It may or may not have been at the hands of a local girl, Loren.  The only thing that is certain is that, for some reason, the local river has turned to blood.  The uber-fundamentalist townfolk are certain that the ten Biblical plagues have come to their sleepy corner of the world, and they believe that the adorably creepy girl is the reason.Anna Sophia Robb (Bridge to Terabithia) plays the questionable and mostly-mute tyke with the same sort of numb withdrawl that can be found in Swank's Katherine Winter.  Both actresses seem stunned to find themselves in such a schlocky movie, and neither one of them looks like they're having much fun.There's fun to be had, I suppose.  The plagues trundle across the screen dutifully, some of them thrown in off-handedly as if they were mere hurdles to cross (the plagues of flies and frogs are mostly laughable), others done succinctly to cool effect (the aforementioned river of blood, the plague of darkness).  Attached to these mostly gratuitous images is a story about sacrifice, devil worship, and heavenly vengeance.Although the plotting certainly isn't sloppy, it's also not very sound.  Much like a freshly erected stack of Jenga blocks, one gets the impression it wouldn't take two well-planned pokes to send the whole thing tumbling to the ground.  Katherine doesn't have much to do in the movie, in spite of her weird-n-wild surroundings, so most of her role consists of creepy dream after creepy dream, as well as so many jittering, incomprehensible flashbacks that the whole film threatens to turn into one epileptic-inducing trailer for itself.Trailers can be entertaining in and of themselves, though, and this is no real exception.  The shards of light and the scattered images do eventually resolve into some kind of sense.  Although that resolution isn't particularly surprising, it is industrious, at least until the final scene.  The makers of ""The Reaping,"" already a (happily) hackneyed film, tack on a (mordantly) hackneyed ending.  The result is labored and dumb, albeit not surprising.""The Reaping"" is by no means a good film, and some would rightfully call it bad.  Given the decent story (such as it is) and the hokum it trots out with such cheesy abandon, I don't fault the film much for the flaws in its faith.  It's nice -- if even in a shadowy way -- to find, in the midst of a world without spirit, a movie that isn't afraid to flaunt its over-cooked soul.",3,Sowing Silly Seeds,1180396800,"05 29, 2007",2007,3179,"['Faith', ""n't"", 'hard', 'thing', 'lose', 'hard', 'thing', 'let', 'go', 'even', 'believing', 'nothing', 'own', 'kind', 'faith', 'Katherine', 'Winter', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'ex-missionary', 'ordained', 'minister', 'who', 'lost', 'faith', 'somewhere', 'dreary', 'hillocks', 'troubled', 'past', 'Now', 'eyes', 'safer', 'saner', 'not', 'more', 'clinical', 'pastures', 'spending', 'time', 'LSU', 'professor', 'specialty', 'debunking', 'myths', 'miracles', 'job', 'grim', 'satisfaction', 'older', 'brother', 'telling', 'younger', 'sibling', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'NOT', 'real.Her', 'services', 'are', 'soon', 'required', 'small', 'town', 'New', 'Orleans', 'name', 'Haven', 'called', 'irony', 'local', 'boy', 'was', 'recently', 'killed', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'hands', 'local', 'girl', 'Loren', 'only', 'thing', 'certain', 'reason', 'local', 'river', 'turned', 'blood', 'uber-fundamentalist', 'townfolk', 'are', 'certain', 'ten', 'Biblical', 'plagues', 'have', 'come', 'sleepy', 'corner', 'world', 'believe', 'adorably', 'creepy', 'girl', 'reason.Anna', 'Sophia', 'Robb', 'Bridge', 'Terabithia', 'questionable', 'mostly-mute', 'tyke', 'same', 'sort', 'numb', 'withdrawl', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'Swank', 'Katherine', 'Winter', 'actresses', 'seem', 'stunned', 'find', 'schlocky', 'movie', 'one', ""'re"", 'having', 'much', 'fun.There', 'fun', 'be', 'had', 'suppose', 'plagues', 'trundle', 'screen', 'dutifully', 'thrown', 'off-handedly', 'were', 'mere', 'hurdles', 'cross', 'plagues', 'flies', 'frogs', 'are', 'mostly', 'laughable', 'others', 'done', 'succinctly', 'cool', 'effect', 'aforementioned', 'river', 'blood', 'plague', 'darkness', 'Attached', 'mostly', 'gratuitous', 'images', 'story', 'sacrifice', 'devil', 'worship', 'heavenly', 'plotting', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'sloppy', 'also', 'not', 'very', 'sound', 'Much', 'freshly', 'erected', 'stack', 'Jenga', 'blocks', 'one', 'impression', 'would', ""n't"", 'take', 'two', 'well-planned', 'pokes', 'send', 'whole', 'thing', 'tumbling', 'ground', 'Katherine', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'do', 'movie', 'spite', 'weird-n-wild', 'surroundings', 'most', 'role', 'creepy', 'dream', 'creepy', 'dream', 'as', 'well', 'so', 'many', 'jittering', 'incomprehensible', 'flashbacks', 'whole', 'film', 'threatens', 'turn', 'one', 'epileptic-inducing', 'trailer', 'itself.Trailers', 'can', 'be', 'entertaining', 'though', 'real', 'exception', 'shards', 'light', 'scattered', 'images', 'do', 'eventually', 'resolve', 'kind', 'sense', 'resolution', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'surprising', 'industrious', 'least', 'final', 'scene', 'makers', 'Reaping', 'already', 'happily', 'hackneyed', 'film', 'tack', 'mordantly', 'hackneyed', 'ending', 'result', 'labored', 'dumb', 'not', 'surprising', 'Reaping', 'means', 'good', 'film', 'would', 'rightfully', 'call', 'bad', 'Given', 'decent', 'story', 'such', 'hokum', 'out', 'such', 'cheesy', 'abandon', 'do', ""n't"", 'fault', 'film', 'much', 'flaws', 'faith', 'nice', 'even', 'shadowy', 'way', 'find', 'midst', 'world', 'spirit', 'movie', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'flaunt', 'over-cooked', 'soul']",N/A

This was yet another one of those horror movies that literally plague the modern world- one that looks so promising on commercials and yet completely disappoints you when you see the entire thing.It's not that it was utter garbage. The plot itself keeps your interest but you nonetheless get a bit irritated at how the story unravels. At first this character Swank plays, who is a know- it- all whose job is to go see places of miracles and then find a scientific explantation to them, travels to a small southern town to to check out this supposed river of blood. Suddenly, shocker, they find out it's real blood. By the time the results come back and confirm it is real blood already there have been livestock dying and the children there have a head full of lice among the locusts as well, which were the most interesting scenes in this film- but Swank soon just grows fascinated with the one girl the whole town is blaming this on, supposedly the girl who killed her brother and that was how it started. But of course there is a lot more to it than the town says but I'll leave that little interesting twist for curious readers to find out when they finally see it.I don't know what exactly ruined this movie. I agree it does sound like a good treat but something really was wrong. Horror films are made by the dozen these days but that doesn't mean horror is easy to succeed in, for a lot of these new films flop because something is seriously lacking as in this one. The best horror films have really an underlying tension that isn't obvious but rather subtle and just scratching at the surface up till the very end. Maybe The Reaping was just trying too hard to be so creepy and so shocking that instead it got sappy and overdrammatic. I think in some parts it was exactly that. I also think Swank is just an overrated actress who can't do well without a strong cast behind her- and she just had an average horror movie cast in the Reaping.I don't recommend this movie unless you just really are into these type of stories like I am. 3/5",3,I Wish I Had Decided To Rent It Out Instead...,1177286400,"04 23, 2007",2007,2209,"['mean', 'horror', 'films', 'are', 'fun', 'watch', 'theater', 'regardless', 'how', 'out', 'still', 'think', 'friend', 'wasted', 'too', 'much', 'money', 'have', 'go', 'out', 'see', 'was', 'yet', 'one', 'horror', 'movies', 'literally', 'plague', 'modern', 'world-', 'one', 'so', 'promising', 'commercials', 'yet', 'completely', 'disappoints', 'when', 'see', 'entire', 'thing.It', 'not', 'was', 'utter', 'garbage', 'plot', 'interest', 'nonetheless', 'get', 'bit', 'irritated', 'how', 'story', 'unravels', 'first', 'character', 'Swank', 'plays', 'who', 'know-', 'it-', 'job', 'go', 'see', 'places', 'miracles', 'then', 'find', 'scientific', 'explantation', 'small', 'southern', 'town', 'check', 'out', 'supposed', 'river', 'blood', 'Suddenly', 'shocker', 'find', 'real', 'blood', 'time', 'results', 'come', 'back', 'confirm', 'real', 'blood', 'already', 'there', 'have', 'been', 'livestock', 'dying', 'children', 'there', 'have', 'head', 'full', 'lice', 'locusts', 'as', 'well', 'were', 'most', 'interesting', 'scenes', 'film-', 'Swank', 'soon', 'just', 'grows', 'fascinated', 'one', 'girl', 'whole', 'town', 'blaming', 'supposedly', 'girl', 'who', 'killed', 'brother', 'was', 'how', 'started', 'course', 'lot', 'more', 'town', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'little', 'interesting', 'twist', 'curious', 'readers', 'find', 'out', 'when', 'finally', 'see', 'it.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'exactly', 'ruined', 'movie', 'agree', 'sound', 'good', 'treat', 'something', 'really', 'was', 'wrong', 'Horror', 'films', 'are', 'made', 'dozen', 'days', ""n't"", 'mean', 'horror', 'easy', 'succeed', 'lot', 'new', 'films', 'flop', 'something', 'seriously', 'lacking', 'one', 'best', 'horror', 'films', 'have', 'really', 'underlying', 'tension', ""n't"", 'obvious', 'rather', 'subtle', 'just', 'scratching', 'surface', 'up', 'very', 'end', 'Maybe', 'Reaping', 'was', 'just', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'so', 'creepy', 'so', 'shocking', 'instead', 'got', 'sappy', 'overdrammatic', 'think', 'parts', 'was', 'exactly', 'also', 'think', 'Swank', 'just', 'overrated', 'actress', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'well', 'strong', 'cast', 'her-', 'just', 'had', 'average', 'horror', 'movie', 'cast', 'Reaping.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'just', 'really', 'are', 'type', 'stories', 'am', '3/5']",N/A

Once an ordained minister but now an atheistic skeptic - a condition brought on by the death of her young daughter - Winter sets out to find a rational, scientific explanation for the phenomenon, only to discover, when she arrives there, that the town is indeed suffering from what appears to be a Biblical Ten Plagues redux.

1093674,A24K6KR7RHW7XB,B000U7169M,Ron,"[0, 0]","It is always nice to watch a bigger budget horror flick for so many reasons like in this case the acting by Swank and her co-stars plus the locations. The locations in The Reaping help add an eerie feel to this story and include a gorgeous plantation estate, old cemetery, the town and the way to cool and creepy swamp. The story isn't new, but the premise twist is newer with the girl and her mother and her followers and the debunking of miracles and the unexplained using science to explain the chain of events is pretty cool.In the last few years we have been inundated with paranormal investigation works that try to either prove or disprove the existence of ghosts, spirits, possessions and demons via science and scientific equipment. This movie predates most of those works and may have helped to bring the genre to life? I don't know, but its just a thought. Anyway, back to the movie.The story is solid and brings Swank's characters story development full circle starting with her faith, families work in Sudan, the tragic loss and then her metamorphosis into a scientist thats mission in life is to debunk miracles and the unexplained.  The LSU peofessor (Swank) and her former grad student (Elba) are called upon to investigate the anomalies in and around the small town of Haven, La. Swank and Elba start their investigation just after they arrive in Haven. They do not use much in the area of equipment to help support their scientific theory or to help reinforce the story for the viewer.Many of the towns residents are convinced that they know the cause of the plague like events and what is behind them.  Morrissey's character (Doug) is not as covinced as the rest of the town and is the one who contacted Swank's character at the begining of the story. The mayor and town council don't want to waste time waiting for the scientific test results to come back to take action, so the pressure is on. The atheist scientist Vs. the bible toting mayor and town council chomping at the bit to take matters into their own hands to stop evil.The movie has so much going for it as mentioned before, but the story lacks any real edge of your seat or nail bitting scare the pants of you feel to it. I hoped that between the swamp as a backdrop and the good acting this movie would have been good. Maybe the story was so well laid out that it was to revealing and nothing was left to the imagination or that all the biblical plagues scenarios have become to obvious and or over used? Whatever the reason this movie missed its mark as a scary horror film. The lack of any real tension, fear, scary scenes or lack of any grotesque figures or to a lesser degree gore turned this movie into a after school movie for all ages.Please don't get me wrong? I don't need a lot of gore, sex or nudity to be present in a movie for it to be good and scary. What I do require is a good creepy story, good acting and direction and creatures or people that are seen or not that are either visually striking or their perceived scary from good writing that sitmulates the imagination and if the story requires blood, gore, drugs, sex and rock ""n"" roll then thats ok too. I did not go into to much detail with my review so I wouldn't spoil the story for you.Was this movie as waste of time to watch? No. not by a long shot. The acting and scenic beauty alone are worth the time. Was this a scary movie? No, not at all, but the effects and locations do add a little creepiness to the story. Is this a family time movie? Yes, it is with its lack of non stop cursing and very little in the sex department and NO T & A, but a touch of sensuality in one or two scenes (flashes of love making without t & a) that shows belly button area. The movie also limits blood and gore to a minimum with the exception of the blood red river/lake scenes. The bodies are not covered in blood.

1093677,A2IKDJBPGCY19V,B000U7169M,seraphcelene,"[1, 3]","The Reaping kinda sucked. The music worked way too hard, heavy, over dramatic in a way that when done right can be hugely affective, like in The Exorcist, but that here was just melodramatic and a little B movie of the week. Suckage also turned out to be a theme because the entire movie was a failure at whatever it actually was attempting. The plot was convoluted, the dialogue was crappy, it wasn't scary and the only reason that I was grossed out was because I made the mistake of eating a grilled cheese sandwich right in the middle of the lake of blood scene. (I have a delicate stomach, yo!)So, let's make a movie and let's set it in the creepy backwaters of the Louisiana Bayou. We'll fill it with happy, southern people dealing with creepy biblical plagues. Throw in a newly menstruating blonde baby girl with big creepy blue eyes and surely we'll have a hit. Was that the pitch meeting? Did anyone really buy that? Hilary Swank did and I hope that she didn't read the script before she signed on cause the only thing that did work was the aforementioned blonde, blue-eyed creepy girl.The Reaping fails at what The Skeleton Key excelled at. You're filming in the south in the bayou only kinda not really. I never got that heavy, languid, creepily atmospheric feeling that pervaded the landscape in The Skeleton Key. The Reaping's version of the Louisiana Bayou was sanitized and too bright. Hilary Swank gently perspired, the plantation was being renovated, but maybe most of the work had already been done. There was no peeling paint or squeaky steps, no rotting wood, very little in the way of tangled underbrush. That heavy feeling you get in tropical locales was completely missing.Having only ever been to Louisiana in the spring and summer maybe I'm missing something and they were filming in the winter.There was the requisite church songs playing in the background on an old record player, mystical, dreamy maybe sex, suspect heroes and the looming apocalypse. With all of that you would think that this movie could work it out. It was spliced with dream sequences and jumbled flashbacks that collided and, I suppose, were meant to make a kind of sense and reveal all sorts of super secret information cause hey, jumbled flashbacky dream sequences, what about that doesn't scream CLUE. Unfortunately, the clues only confused us more and we actually paused, re-wound and slow-mo'd through a couple of them. It still didn't really make sense. Not that that was unusual because most of the movie didn't make sense either and we all sat back as the credits rolled to try and piece together what actually happened and how in the heck Hilary Swank ended up carrying the anti-Christ when the entire time we thought the big-eyed blonde girl was the perfect demon child.Well, as it turns out the blonde, Lauren, was a sort of angel. A second born child embodying the wrath of God, Lauren's purpose is to destroy the evil that's been brewing in Haven, Louisiana for generations. I have to say that I called it as we watched Lauren and Katherine (Hilary Swank) bond over the joy of becoming a woman. I figured that the entire town had been worshipping Satan and that now that they'd ""reaped"" (see how they did that) the perfect child they were in a panic because they couldn't actually control her. Well, I was *almost* right. Turns out they were trying to kill her not because they couldn't control her but because she was going to Kill Them All. See, Little Lauren was conjuring the Ten Plagues of Egypt and if you all recall the tenth plague is the Death of the First Borns. Well, Haven just so happened to be a town full of first born's as part of the tenets of their devil worshipping sect.The entire movie was difficult and mostly silly and I couldn't figure out why Hilary Swank ran around at night in a flowing white skirt. What was that about, really?! Then there was, of course, the one COC, Ben. Ben is Katherine's T.A. from LSU and he's got a Master's degree and he's an educated black man who believes in the Lord (been going to church every Sunday for ten years) and was saved back in the day when he used to be a drug dealer and gang banger and general all around bad man. Of course, he also died. Like I didn't see that one coming.Dude, seriously?!Yeah, that's what I said, too.The only thing that I did like about the movie was AnnaSophia Robb as Lauren McConnell, the angel masquerading as the Anti-Christ. That little girl is beautiful and angelic and creepy all at the same time. With her big, big blue eyes and delicate bone structure she managed to be all of those things that I think Rob Zombie was looking for in Daeg Faerch and failed to find.Idris Elba did a good job with the crappy dialogue and did a great job creating a generic American accent. Too bad, really, because I think all if not most of the characters were actually supposed to be from Louisiana. David Morrissey was especially bad. DUDE! Seriously creepy southern town in the creepy backwater bayous of Louisiana where ""every bump in the night is the devil at your back door""! Seriously?!I didn't see the point of paying Stephen Rea to appear in the movie and Hilary Swank took ten steps backwards to play the part.

This movie is a white knuckle thrill ride for those of us who enjoy a good scare.Hilary Swank plays a former Christian missionary who now specializes in debunking religious phenomena, who has been called upon to investigate a small Louisiana town which seems to be suffering from the 10 Biblical plagues. Kudos to the film crew staying down south in between Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita to continue filming! At first, the small town of Haven seems like any Maple Drive all-American town but I had trouble believing we were deep in voodoo country.  Hilary's assistant is the only black man in town!  But all that is quickly thrown aside when the two accompany officials to take a look at the town river that has turned red.  The Spanish moss-laced scenery is breath taking and you will soon be settled in for a good chill that doesn't go away so easily.One by one, the ten plagues start to affect the town and are linked to a backwoods family shunned by the towns folk.  Hilary and her assistant investigate but have trouble dismissing the plagues with the help of science.  It all builds up to a magnificent locust attack scene that you MUST see on the big screen.

O'Blenis,"[9, 9]","A supernatural/otherworldy 'good vs. evil' horror movie in the general vein ofThe Exorcism of Emily Rose - Unrated (Special Edition)The Exorcist - The Complete Anthology (The Exorcist/ The Exorcist- Unrated/ The Exorcist II: The Heretic/ The Exorcist III/ The Exorcist: The Beginning/ The Exorcist: Dominion), ""The Reaping"" is an underated film, not as scary as 'Exorcist' or 'Emily Rose' but very good nonetheless, nowhere near as campy as its critics say.  Its style moves closer at times to suspense thrillers than other movies of its type, and may open it up to be enjoyed by fans of that kind of movie as well as by horror fans.Hillary Swank plays a former Christian aid worker turned ardent atheist; teaching at a university she now specializes in 'debunking' miracles and other paranormal phenomena.  Having achieved some not in certain academic circles, she's contacted by a man on behalf of a small Southern bayou town where a host of ominous and apparantly supernatural events are taking place.  Tensions are running high in the community, and the mayor and his colleagues really want for somebody to come in, find a scientific explanation for everything, and hopefully calm the townspeople down, some of whom are starting to think about taking matters into their own hands.  What's happening in this little rural corner appears to be nothing less than the ten Biblical plagues re-occuring, and bearing the blame for this is a little girl who lives off in the swamp with her mother, and is believed by some to be evil incarnate.  Some are starting to fear that townspeople's anxieties are running so high that the little girl's life may be in danger.Once Swank's character and her assistant are in town, the phenomena quickly prove to be more difficult to discredit than other events the two have investigated.  And eventually it starts to come out that there may be even more to the story than what they've been told.  There are some good twists towards the end; some of them are actually surprising, and beyond that, they're quite affecting on other levels too.  There's a good mix of characters you like right off the bat, ones you dislike right off the bat, and ones you have mixed feelings about right from the start.  The cast does a good job with their roles and the story is well told with a good interplay of different angles and elements; one area that could have admittedly used some improvement was the special effects, but these only play a major role during a couple of the movie's scenes.  Definately better than its reputation, and fans of Exorcist, Omen and Exorism Of Emily Rose should really make it a point to see this one.  8.5 out of 10",4,Way Better Than People Are Saying - Solid Horror With Spiritual Overtones,1208217600,"04 15, 2008",2008,2668,"['supernatural/otherworldy', ""'good"", 'vs.', 'evil', 'horror', 'movie', 'general', 'vein', 'ofThe', 'Exorcism', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'Unrated', 'Special', 'Edition', 'Exorcist', 'Complete', 'Anthology', 'Exorcist/', 'Exorcist-', 'Unrated/', 'Exorcist', 'II', 'Heretic/', 'Exorcist', 'III/', 'Exorcist', 'Beginning/', 'Exorcist', 'Dominion', 'Reaping', 'underated', 'film', 'not', 'as', 'scary', ""'Exorcist"", ""'Emily"", 'Rose', 'very', 'good', 'nonetheless', 'nowhere', 'as', 'campy', 'critics', 'say', 'style', 'moves', 'closer', 'times', 'suspense', 'thrillers', 'other', 'movies', 'type', 'may', 'open', 'up', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'fans', 'kind', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'horror', 'fans.Hillary', 'Swank', 'former', 'Christian', 'aid', 'worker', 'turned', 'ardent', 'atheist', 'teaching', 'university', 'now', ""'debunking"", 'miracles', 'other', 'paranormal', 'phenomena', 'Having', 'achieved', 'not', 'certain', 'academic', 'circles', 'contacted', 'man', 'behalf', 'small', 'Southern', 'bayou', 'town', 'where', 'host', 'ominous', 'apparantly', 'supernatural', 'events', 'are', 'taking', 'place', 'Tensions', 'are', 'running', 'high', 'community', 'mayor', 'colleagues', 'really', 'want', 'somebody', 'come', 'find', 'scientific', 'explanation', 'everything', 'hopefully', 'calm', 'townspeople', 'down', 'whom', 'are', 'starting', 'think', 'taking', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'What', 'happening', 'little', 'rural', 'corner', 'be', 'nothing', 'less', 'ten', 'Biblical', 'plagues', 're-occuring', 'bearing', 'blame', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'off', 'swamp', 'mother', 'believed', 'be', 'evil', 'incarnate', 'are', 'starting', 'fear', 'townspeople', 'anxieties', 'are', 'running', 'so', 'high', 'little', 'girl', 'life', 'may', 'be', 'danger.Once', 'Swank', 'character', 'assistant', 'are', 'town', 'phenomena', 'quickly', 'prove', 'be', 'more', 'difficult', 'discredit', 'other', 'events', 'two', 'have', 'investigated', 'eventually', 'come', 'out', 'may', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'story', 'what', ""'ve"", 'been', 'told', 'are', 'good', 'twists', 'end', 'are', 'actually', 'surprising', ""'re"", 'quite', 'affecting', 'other', 'levels', 'too', 'good', 'mix', 'characters', 'right', 'bat', 'ones', 'dislike', 'right', 'bat', 'ones', 'have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'right', 'start', 'cast', 'good', 'job', 'roles', 'story', 'well', 'told', 'good', 'interplay', 'different', 'angles', 'elements', 'one', 'area', 'could', 'have', 'admittedly', 'used', 'improvement', 'was', 'special', 'effects', 'only', 'play', 'major', 'role', 'couple', 'movie', 'scenes', 'Definately', 'better', 'reputation', 'fans', 'Exorcist', 'Omen', 'Exorism', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'should', 'really', 'make', 'point', 'see', 'one', '8.5', '10']",N/A

I absolutely loved the plot and the acting and sound were superb. Hillary Swank was excellent as well. They could not have cast these two better.I think Idris Elba was mis-cast -- probably to politically-correctly couterbalance the first part of the film where Hillary Swank's family was killed by machete for voodoo reasons in Africa by blacks... Can't have blacks being the voodoo bad guys and that's it. Come to think of it, the whole film was aimed at the plantation / deep traditional south types as being just as voodoo as the Africans -- a sort of spiritual affirmative-action? There is only one problem. We know the average IQ of Africans is around 67, but for American whites the average is over 100... so that part was hard to swallow. Africans are way more voodoo than southern whites ever dreamed of being. (That's why they turn the Catholicism that colonialists forced on them into Santeria..). So what's up with that? Lets stop beating up on southerners and promoting negative stereotypes that are untrue. Pretty nitpicky, I know... At least it was not as blatantly political as ""Villiage of the Damned"" or ""Schindlers List"" or something. This part of the review can be chalked up to my personal views though -- I HATE POLITICS. Why does it ALWAYS have to rear it's ugly head in my movies? I don't like feeling like I'm being taught something at a Norman Lear festival (you know, mr. TV-shows-are-for-social-engineering himself.) I don't like commercials, not even more subtle 2-hour ones for anyone's non-universal interests or greed. There. Rant done.Other than that, I truly do not understand the negative reviews (except by maybe religious or southern religious people...?). This was a great movie -- suspenseful, gripping, powerful. Great acting. Great sound. Great special effects. If you liked Anna Sophia Robb in ""Because of Winn-Dixie"" and ""Bridge to Terabithia"" then you will love her in this too as an angel of God.

1093687,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000U7169M,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[1, 15]","Katherine (Hilary Swank), a former missionary, now travels the world investigating `miracles'; she doesn't believe in them anymore and she is always able to find a scientific explanation for the occurrence. A professor at LSU, she is approached by Doug (David Morrissey, BBC America's ""Viva Blackpool"") the science teacher in a small town called Haven, up in the Louisiana Bayou. Katherine and her assistant, Ben (Idris Elba), a former student now professor, arrive to find an idyllic little town. But when they arrive at the river, the site of a murder, they find the water has turned to blood. A strange, young girl, Loren (AnnaSophia Robb, ""The Bridge to Terrabithia"") has murdered her older brother and now the town fears it will be visited by the ten biblical plagues. As Katherine, Ben and Doug continue to poke around, it appears the townsfolk might be right; frogs, locusts, fire in the sky, and more all happen with increasing frequency. Katherine is desperate to prove this can all be proved by science before the townsfolk murder Loren, believing she is a messenger of Satan.""The Reaping"", directed by Stephen Hopkins (TV's ""24"", ""The Ghost and the Darkness""), starts out in a promising fashion, but quickly deteriorates.Since the ten plagues feature so heavily in the story, let's examine the seven different sins this film commits.1. The sin of Greed.On the one hand, it seems odd that Swank would follow her second Oscar winning performance (""Million Dollar Baby"") with ""Freedom Writers"" and "" The Reaping"".On the other hand, it doesn't seem odd at all.These are big budget films, so she was likely offered a large paycheck for both and can't be blamed for trying to earn some real money for her craft. She clearly didn't make a lot of money for ""Boys Don't Cry"" and didn't receive a lot for ""Million Dollar Baby"". Why shouldn't she try to capitalize on her fame and make some money?One reason: because she isn't paying respect to her craft. Swank is a very good actress and has created some memorable characters in her films. Both Oscar winning performances were also very different, providing further testament to her artistic abilities.It is sad that so many fine actors and actresses find it necessary to make inferior films simply to keep their name in the public's eye and to help sustain their career. The worst films Robert DeNiro and Meryl Streep have made are the films that were their most commercial and offered the biggest paychecks. These are great actors who should wait for great roles. Their fans would appreciate them all the more as well.2. The sin of Sloth.""The Reaping"" has a couple of plot twists which really test credibility, even in a film about the ten plagues visiting a small Louisiana bayou town. The filmmakers were lazy and throw in one last plot twist at the very end, to simply make the film seem shocking and, hopefully, memorable. But this plot twist is just stupid and telegraphed to the audience way in advance. Then they throw in a final plot twist, which is also stupid and telegraphed in advance, so it doesn't provide the necessary shock either.At this point, they apparently have used up their imagination and skill. Rather than to create something interesting, they take the easy way out and try to shock us. It doesn't work.3. The sin of Envy.The film begins promisingly. We watch as Katherine and Ben investigate a `miracle' in a small South American village. It sets a nice eerie tone for the film, which seems as though it might continue once the story shifts to Louisiana. As each plague happens, Katherine is left scrambling to try to figure out why it happened, and can't. So her faith is tested once again.Then, towards the end of the film, director Hopkins seems to realize this is a bid budget film and he hasn't had the opportunity to use a lot of special effects. ""Let's use them all"" he seems to say. ""Other directors get to spend a lot of money on these, why can't I?""  And the climax is a barrage of light and sound, all created within a computer and looking just as fake as you could imagine.It doesn't help that this sequence is so clearly filmed on a set, and not even a realistic one at that. We are talking about a set that would've been commonplace in the 50s. In fact, I think the set was also used in Tim Burton's ""Ed Wood"", about the schlock meister who made some of the worst films in history. So, we have a fake set overwhelmed by loud, obnoxious special effects. This doesn't help to make the sequence more believable and completely eradicates any feeling of mood or suspense that may have been created through out the beginning of the film.4. The sin of Gluttony.One of the plagues, flies, is visited upon the group as they have a barbecue dinner. All of a sudden, their food is covered with flies and maggots. Yuck. But it doesn't really fit in with the rest of the story. It almost seems as though this scene is included to knock off one of the plagues, to make sure they get through all ten.5. The sin of Lust.There are a couple of lame attempts to create a romantic triangle, between Katherine, Doug and Ben, but they don't work. Nothing is ever developed in the relationship between Katherine and Ben, except for a few furtive glances. So when Doug becomes a glimmer in Katherine's eye, any attempts to build jealousy on Ben's part fall flat.One of these tacked-on surprise endings also concerns lust, in a way. But it is so silly it merely serves to make us laugh.As I watched ""The Reaping"", I initially thought I had lucked onto a fairly good film. But as the film progressed, I realized I had made a mistake. ""The Reaping"" would follow the course set by many, many horror/ terror/ supernatural films. The film would ultimately fall apart. As this became more and more apparent, I began to lust for a more substantial film, something made with more skill and thought.6. The sin of Pride.Or lack thereof.Hilary Swank should take more care with her career. As discussed, she seems to be taking roles to earn a paycheck. If she isn't careful, she will make one too many bad decisions and then won't enjoy the wealth of opportunity she now has. She should take more pride in the fact that she has earned two Academy Awards, for very memorable performances and stop subjecting us to these roles, the type of films more suitable for actresses like Jessica Biel, Ali Larter and Kate Mara.All of this leads to the final sin...7. The sin of Wrath/ Anger.""The Reaping"" ultimately deteriorates, throwing special effects at the screen, ruining any characterizations the actors may have been able to establish, and throwing many plot twists at us. This led me to become angry at the amount of time I wasted watching this film.",2,The Seven Sins of Hilary as She Investigates The Ten Plagues,1177027200,"04 20, 2007",2007,6705,"['Katherine',

1093691,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000U7169M,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 8]","""The Reaping"" is produced by Joel Silver's Dark Castle Entertainment, which had made such films as ""House on the Haunted Hill"" ""The 13en Ghosts"" and ""House of Wax."" For their sixth film, they have chosen religious issues as the theme of the new film, which stars Hilary Swank as Kathleen, former missionary and professor who has to investigate the strange events in the small town of Haven. David Morrissey plays Doug, a science teacher at the local school, Idris Elba as Ben, Kathleen's co-worker and Stephen Rea as Father Costigan, whose warning Kathleen ignores, well, at first.""The strange events"" or ""plagues"" include the river water turning red, or diseases that kill animals, and probably you can guess what follows after them. Like any films from Dark Castle Entertainment, each spooky event is expressed with decent photography and production designs, plus the credible locations of Louisiana.For all its merits, however, ""The Reaping"" lacks the narrative power that is needed to draw the viewers into the world it describes. The character of Kathleen, who has lost her faith because of a traumatic event, is barely interesting as heroine to whom we relate, and her romantic relations with Doug (which plays an important part in the plot) are not convincing, lacking emotional depths. Though the film shows dark atmosphere, the mysterious events or ""miracles"" are not mysterious enough.The story also involves a little girl named Loren (played by AnnaSophia Robb, impressive in ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory""), who might or might not be responsible for these plagues in the local town. The film gets better in the second part where we meet this mysterious girl Loren, but sadly the film takes too much time to reach there. Actually, Director Stephen Hopkins seems more interested in something else, but not the girl and Miss Robb who should be in the center of the film's story.I still don't know if I should call ""The Reaping"" a horror film because not many people, I think, would find it scary. That in itself may not be a problem, but it is true that for all its aptly dark atmosphere, the film's suspense fades away too quickly -- as occult thriller, supernatural thriller, or any kind of thriller or drama -- after we come to know where the film leading us to. Many things we will see here, we have seen elsewhere before, perhaps in better films.

1093693,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B000U7169M,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[6, 9]","I am biased. I love Hilary Swank. Like Biblical thrillers. Impressed with great visual effects.Two-time Oscar winner Hilary Swank is a great actress, I believe given the right role, she will portray it to near-perfection. Her latest film, ""The Reaping"" is a Biblical thriller based on the 10 Plagues in the Book of Exodus. I'm assuming most, if not everyone has heard the story of Moses, if you did, then, you pretty much know what the film is about. The question is: What is the motivation for the 10 Biblical plagues?Plot synopsis partially derived from the back cover:Katherine Winter, (Hilary Swank) a former ordained minister who lost her faith is now an occult investigator with the purpose of debunking modern ""miracles"" bringing a scientific explanation to superstition and exposing frauds. Events in a small town called Haven, Louisiana defies all scientific explanation. The 10 Biblical plagues are occurring in the same order as in the book of Exodus. Katherine's investigations uncover more questions, she finds that the plagues are linked to the murder of a boy and a young girl. Are they Harbingers of evil or something else? Time is running out for Katherine, as it turns out not just the town is at stake, but maybe creation itself..""The Reaping"" has a very interesting premise, but the screenplay is far from perfect. To its credit, it does execute a lot more things RIGHT than wrong. Although, not wholly original, it has a lot of similarities to ""Bless the Child"" and ""Rosemary's Baby"", I have to say by going into a different direction by taking the time in character development, it succeeds in bringing a bit of mystery. The studio responsible is Dark Castle Entertainment, known for gory thrillers like the remake of ""House on Haunted Hill"" and ""Ghost Ship"". People who are expecting a fast-paced bloody horror film will be disappointed. Visually speaking, ""The Reaping"" has phenomenal special effects that surpasses most horror flicks, the EFX are realistically done, especially the ""Locusts swarm"", the visuals are very impressive. (I hated the cheesy EFX in ""The Haunting"" remake)As mentioned above, the film goes to a different direction. It ignores the blood and gore approach, it is more a tightly-wound thriller than a horror film. The direction by Stephen Hopkins could have done better with a lot less banter, but all in all, each main character is fleshed out a little more(even the townsfolk). Some may say it could have done without these factors, because the screenplay did divert into a ""pointless"" direction at times that it did have some dull moments but I rather thought that they were still necessary to liven the transition from each plague. After all, the plagues didn't happen overnight. Does ""The Reaping"" deliver as a thriller? Yes, but it did stumble a bit in that area. It is NOT an ""edge of your seat"" kind but rather it takes its time.As usual, Hilary Swank does a great performance. This movie would have failed miserably with a lesser actress in the lead, but Hilary passes with flying colors and does the best anyone can expect from her character. David Morissey and Stephen Rea both do a decent supporting performance.I saw the Warner Bros. Asian region-3 release, I think it would be safe to say the U.S. release will utilize the same transfer.VIDEO/AUDIO: Anamorphic Widescreen. The transfer is flawless, very sharp and clean. Colors are radiant although a bit on the softer side. Black levels are very solid throughout. The 5.1 Dolby Digital track is very powerful and suited for the film. I'm a DTS fan myself, but the 5.1 Dolby is not shabby.Closing remarks:""The Reaping"" is not reinventing the suspense thriller genre, but with the strong performances of its leads, especially Swank, and the different approach it went with character development, it is worth a watch. The way it is directed may be a bit slow at times and the heavy-handed climax may not be perfect, but the special effects together with the main premise kept me interested for the most part. It may not hold up to repeated viewings, but it is at least worth a rental for most people and gets a ""Recommended"" rating for those who like Biblical thrillers.
