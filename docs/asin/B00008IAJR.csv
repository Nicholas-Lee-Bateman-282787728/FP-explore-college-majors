I re-purchased almost all the films I had in DVD format.This movie is one of the great classics of world cinema and is a must view.  Why am I rating it only 3 stars?  The DVD transfer is AWFUL.

Perhaps that's why Woody Allen was attracted to them both and employed them in recent films.  He was reaching back into old epic roots and didn't even know it.Radha is a young maiden in India whose mother entangles her into a scheme whereby a local moneylender would pay for the cost of her wedding, but in the process, like Shylock, he comes to ""own"" the whole family and causes them pain for generations to come.  The mother is not a simpleton, more like a Lillian Gish type, and besides, we get the picture that this is just how things were done back then, and that dowries and fancy weddings were everything to these people.  The action switches to the birth and development of Radha's two little boys, Ramu and Birju, who grow and mature during the film, and struggle against the age-old curse of the moneylender, who nows owns everything (like the carpetbaggers in GONE WITH THE WIND).The only thing that you've ever seen in Western cinema to compare it to fairly would be Michael Powell's GONE TO EARTH with Jennifer Jones (sometimes called THE WILD HEART).  Jennifer Jones, perhaps Susan Hayward, is the only Hollywood star with emotional power enough to have conveyed, maybe, Radha's metonymic attachment to land and family.  Alas she never got a chance to perform in the cinema of Bombay!  It's all about melodrama, music, dance, spectacle, heart and something else, something that can't be pinned down.  Recommended with a plus sign, and two such signs should you ever have had a mother or a country.",5,Earth And High Heaven,1128556800,"10 6, 2005",2005,1943,"['kind', 'GONE', 'WITH', 'THE', 'WIND', 'sort', 'THE', 'GOOD', 'EARTH', 'even', 'bit', 'EAST', 'OF', 'EDEN', 'really', 'MOTHER', 'INDIA', 'own', 'thing', 'one', 'loci', 'classici', 'so-called', 'Bollywood', 'young', 'screen', 'star', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'PITCH', 'BLACK', 'NEVERLAND', 'MELINDA', 'AND', 'MELINDA', 'was', 'named', 'longsuffering', 'heroine', 'Radha', 'movie', 'Scarlett', 'Johanson', 'was', 'similarly', 'named', 'heroine', 'GONE', 'WITH', 'THE', 'WIND', 'Perhaps', 'why', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'was', 'attracted', 'employed', 'recent', 'films', 'was', 'reaching', 'back', 'old', 'epic', 'roots', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'it.Radha', 'young', 'maiden', 'India', 'mother', 'scheme', 'whereby', 'local', 'moneylender', 'would', 'pay', 'cost', 'wedding', 'process', 'Shylock', 'own', 'whole', 'family', 'pain', 'generations', 'come', 'mother', 'not', 'simpleton', 'more', 'Lillian', 'Gish', 'type', 'besides', 'get', 'picture', 'just', 'how', 'things', 'were', 'done', 'back', 'then', 'dowries', 'fancy', 'weddings', 'were', 'everything', 'people', 'action', 'birth', 'development', 'Radha', 'two', 'little', 'boys', 'Ramu', 'Birju', 'who', 'grow', 'mature', 'film', 'struggle', 'age-old', 'curse', 'moneylender', 'who', 'everything', 'carpetbaggers', 'GONE', 'WITH', 'THE', 'WIND', 'only', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Western', 'cinema', 'compare', 'fairly', 'would', 'be', 'Michael', 'Powell', 'GONE', 'TO', 'EARTH', 'Jennifer', 'Jones', 'sometimes', 'called', 'THE', 'WILD', 'HEART', 'Jennifer', 'Jones', 'perhaps', 'Susan', 'Hayward', 'only', 'Hollywood', 'star', 'emotional', 'power', 'enough', 'have', 'conveyed', 'maybe', 'Radha', 'metonymic', 'attachment', 'land', 'family', 'Alas', 'never', 'got', 'chance', 'perform', 'cinema', 'Bombay', 'melodrama', 'music', 'dance', 'spectacle', 'heart', 'something', 'else', 'something', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'pinned', 'down', 'Recommended', 'plus', 'sign', 'two', 'such', 'signs', 'should', 'ever', 'have', 'had', 'mother', 'country']",Mother India

What is also shows is life is not better for the villagers in India now as it was then. The hope shown is hope lost in today's reality.  However for any movies buff who watches the 1940s US movies we are a lost people too. So much potential for both our countries that to see these movies and see the now reality we are much closer to the reality of &#34; Brazil&#34; ( the movie) than any hopeful future shown in this movie. It is well worth watching and we all know the plight of Women in India is no better today. Just as here only a few rich women get the dream.,5,Classic,1394841600,"03 15, 2014",2014,639,"['Nargis', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'hope', 'loss', 'life', 'What', 'also', 'life', 'not', 'better', 'villagers', 'India', 'now', 'was', 'then', 'hope', 'shown', 'hope', 'lost', 'today', 'reality', 'However', 'movies', 'buff', 'who', '1940s', 'US', 'movies', 'are', 'lost', 'people', 'too', 'So', 'much', 'potential', 'countries', 'see', 'movies', 'see', 'now', 'reality', 'are', 'much', 'closer', 'reality', '34', 'Brazil', '34', 'movie', 'hopeful', 'future', 'shown', 'movie', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'know', 'plight', 'Women', 'India', 'better', 'today', 'Just', 'here', 'only', 'few', 'rich', 'women', 'get', 'dream']",Mother India
