1433080,A2JI61LBTEHMK4,B004YBMM0M,"Cindy Elias ""Snow Moon""","[5, 5]","This story is a very heartfelt story.  It starts out with a couple that are enjoying being together and the way their lives are going.  A friend dies and leaves them four children in her will.  How they will respond to the children and what they do about their growing love for them is really what the movie is all about.  The children are great and really teach the adults a lesson in caring.  I think this is one of the very best movies to come along in a long time.  No swearing, no bad situations, not much violence, except the oldest boy gets picked on and teaches the quarterback a lesson (that's minor compared to other movies) and it's just a really nice story.  I am so happy I bought this and will enjoy seeing it again.

1433082,A2IIA0B5V2W9F2,B004YBMM0M,Kathy,"[2, 3]","A Change of Plans starring Joe Flanigan and Brooke White is a good movie.  Parts of this movie are predictable.  The story is not a new one.  The children are different.  These children are not the usual smart-alecky, bratty, selfish types that populate tv.  They come from different backgrounds and weren't raised on happy meals, ipods, ipads, etc.  This made them refreshing to watch.  The child actors did a very good job of bringing their characters to life.Brooke White made her acting debut.  She did a wonderful job.  She and Joe came across as a real couple.  This waa a good role for Joe.  It gave him a chance to be more like himself.  Joe is married and has 3 sons.  His character's transition into becoming a parent was realistic.This movie is not heavy drama or comedy.  It is a good blend of both.  Not too heavy and not too light.

The question is whether their new guardians, now fostering them, will keep them and accept the drastic change in their lifestyle and careers or ship them to another family(s) for adoption.Brooke White, from American Idol, plays the wife, a up and coming musical artist- she's super!

OK for the kids. There's no bad guys.

What really surprised me was the way in which the movie was a marketing vehicle.  They have Walmart products in the family kitchen, and make a shopping trip to a nearby Walmart.  At one point it was announced that the male lead had something to do with NASCAR, and it was obvious that meant a trip to a NASCAR event would take place before the movie was over.

Even before I watched the movie, I loved the concept of how sometimes our plans don't go according to our wishes, but that doesn't mean those plans can't turn out for the better.Jason and Sally are living the good life. They are both on the fast track to success in their careers and they share a close and loving marriage.  What happens when Sally's best friend dies and Sally and Jason are named in the will to raise the four children? Add in to the plot the fact that the children were living with their parents doing Peace Corps work in Uganda. Yes, you guessed it - Jason's and Sally's lives will for sure be including a change of plans.One of my favorite things about this movie is how, while we can make all the plans we want, God ultimately has the map of our lives. Sometimes in our pursuit of living our lives the way we want, we realize how much of a positive impact we can have on the lives of others if only we become reach out to others and put their needs first.  There are many great discussion questions in this movie, including Romans 8:28.I loved this movie and it contains nothing objectionable. Parents will want to pause it a few times to discuss some of the issues; namely, the tragic death of the parents and how each child chose to cope with that loss. There was only one thing I wished could have been done differently in this movie: one of the boys gets into trouble twice - once for fighting and once for stealing Jason's car. There were no consequences for these actions. We spent some time with our own kids discussing with them that actions do have consequences and how fortunate the boy in the movie was not to have been seriously injured or worse in his decision to make a bad choice.Other than that, I would highly recommend this movie and I applaud the filmakers for creating movies for the entire family.

Foot tapping songs with uplifting lyrics by really talented musicians. Literally every song could be an adult contemporary hit single. The movie is surprising in that Phylicia Rashad (Mrs Cosby on The Cosby Show) comes off as an amateur while Brooke White, a novice actor at least when it comes to TV/film dramas, does a fantastic job. For a couple that never considered having kids and says they don't know anything about how to raise them, the lead actors sure do a terrific job in this story. The movie won't contend for any Oscars, but it's completely family friendly and entertaining. If you want your kids to see what a really good marriage looks like, and how a healthy, happy marriage with kids can be really fulfilling and fun, show them this movie.
