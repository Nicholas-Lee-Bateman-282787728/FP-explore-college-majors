Barnes ""Florida Doris Fan""","[12, 12]","I LOVE this movie, I was in high school when this came out and the theater was packed opening night due to the fact that Morgan 'bares all' and she did!  But I loved the movie even though it was campy at the time it came out, and its even more camp now.  Speaking of camp, I love Colleen Camp in this film, the wisecraking best friend was a perfect role for her I only wish that her character would have been expanded to the end of the film. I would like to have seen her come in and battle Derek at the end instead of his mousy assisant. My other compliant has always been Michael Sarrizan, who has to be the worst actor ever to grace the screen, in fact the roles should have been reversed, Michael should have played Derek and Andrew should have been Brandon, Those are my only two complaints about the story, but the campy long held camara shots of Morgan in various stages of fear and looking great are just to funny, this is early 80's camp at its best....

I have the 1985 Media Video release of this movie, and this Anchor Bay DVD version blows it away!  I didn't realize or remember this movie being filmed in cinemascope.  Anchor Bay has cleaned up the picture quality, remastered the soundtrack, and brought it back to it's original glory, in it's original aspect ratio.  VHS releases never did the film any justice.  There was even an ""EP cheapie"" version of this movie released back in the '90s.  One thing that I've noticed about this film is that the telephone is one of the leading stars of the plot.  There is a lot of ringing and screen time devoted to focusing on the phone.  The actors seem to be really slow on picking up the phone after it rings a few times too.  This is one of the charms of this movie, along with it starring Morgan Fairchild.  I think the director was using the phone to build suspence.  Nothing like those old AT&T/Western Electric phones to do the trick!  There are a variety of them too, from the classic 2500 Traditional, to the Princess phone! Another movie that used this technique was ""When A Stranger Calls"" from 1980.  There are some added features, like a few interviews with the director/producer, and the original movie trailer.  There is even a mini reproduction of the movie poster within the keepcase, for a nice added touch.  This DVD will not disappoint for fans of Morgan Fairchild, and early '80s b-movie fare.

206585,A26WVK274IA7DN,6300186822,Sarah Bellum,"[19, 20]","(3.5/5 stars)  Andrew Stevens, that handsome staple of `70s-`80s American television, plays Derek, a young photographer who is obsessed with the beautiful Jamie Douglas (Morgan Fairchild). When Derek begins sending Jamie presents and calling her, she assumes he watches her on the local TV news, where she is a newscaster. She has no idea he is her neighbor and that he photographs her swimming nude in her pool. His obsession evolves from voyeurism into an active pursuit when he begins to pay her surprise visits and invades her home with the intent of making her love him. Yet still he is only able to photograph her because his ingrained passivity prevents him from acting on his lustful urges. Only in his delusional fantasy is he capable of making love to her. I actually like this movie. No, it isn't Oscar material, but it is above average as far as B movies go. The acting is adequate, the story doesn't stray from the central plot and yes, Morgan Fairchild appears nude (looks fantastic too). Apparently Jef Films released a DVD of this film a couple years ago, though I did not buy it then because I know the quality of their DVDs is extremely poor. When I saw Anchor Bay had recently released a DVD of the film, I did not hesitate to purchase it (for a lower price, I might add) because I know they take great pride in the quality of their DVDs. I am very glad I waited to purchase this because the Anchor Bay transfer is outstanding. For a movie that is twenty-five years old, it looks great. There are also a couple documentaries on the disc, though I have not watched those yet. The only grievance I have about the disc is the lack of subtitles. I'm not sure what Anchor Bay has against them, but I have several DVDs from them and none has subtitles. They aren't imperative for this movie, though sometimes they help clarify the dialogue. I'd recommend this for fans of Andrew Stevens (if there are any), Morgan Fairchild, B movies or even anyone feeling nostalgic for the `70s and `80s.",4,"""If I can't have you, no one can.""",1168387200,"01 10, 2007",2007,2002,"['3.5/5', 'stars', 'Andrew', 'Stevens', 'handsome', 'staple', '70s-', '80s', 'American', 'television', 'Derek', 'young', 'photographer', 'who', 'obsessed', 'beautiful', 'Jamie', 'Douglas', 'Morgan', 'Fairchild', 'When', 'Derek', 'sending', 'Jamie', 'presents', 'calling', 'local', 'TV', 'news', 'where', 'newscaster', 'idea', 'neighbor', 'swimming', 'nude', 'pool', 'obsession', 'voyeurism', 'active', 'pursuit', 'when', 'pay', 'surprise', 'visits', 'home', 'intent', 'making', 'love', 'still', 'only', 'able', 'photograph', 'ingrained', 'passivity', 'prevents', 'acting', 'lustful', 'urges', 'Only', 'delusional', 'fantasy', 'capable', 'making', 'love', 'actually', 'movie', 'No', ""n't"", 'Oscar', 'material', 'above', 'average', 'as', 'far', 'B', 'movies', 'go', 'acting', 'adequate', 'story', ""n't"", 'stray', 'central', 'plot', 'yes', 'Morgan', 'Fairchild', 'nude', 'fantastic', 'too', 'Apparently', 'Jef', 'Films', 'released', 'DVD', 'film', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'did', 'not', 'buy', 'then', 'know', 'quality', 'DVDs', 'extremely', 'poor', 'When', 'saw', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'had', 'recently', 'released', 'DVD', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'hesitate', 'purchase', 'lower', 'price', 'might', 'add', 'know', 'take', 'great', 'pride', 'quality', 'DVDs', 'am', 'very', 'glad', 'waited', 'purchase', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'transfer', 'outstanding', 'movie', 'twenty-five', 'years', 'old', 'great', 'are', 'also', 'couple', 'documentaries', 'disc', 'have', 'not', 'watched', 'yet', 'only', 'grievance', 'have', 'disc', 'lack', 'subtitles', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'have', 'several', 'DVDs', 'none', 'subtitles', 'are', ""n't"", 'imperative', 'movie', 'sometimes', 'help', 'clarify', 'dialogue', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'fans', 'Andrew', 'Stevens', 'are', 'Morgan', 'Fairchild', 'B', 'movies', 'even', 'anyone', 'feeling', 'nostalgic', '70s', '80s']",N/A

since it had some interesting drama to it that left you jumping & guessing at times and made you feel pity for L.A. news anchorwoman Jamie Douglas(Morgan Fairchild)even though you couldn't help admiring all the graphic nude scenes of Morgan at the same time, especially since they showed Morgan's Womanhood with a lot of graphic nudity, not to mention skinny-dipping or even being a lady sleeping in the nude alone is never a smart idea or a wise thing to do even at your own house, since swimming buck-naked and being a female sleeping naked usually contributes to nothing but trouble and spying, not to mention this was Morgan's biggest skinteresting flick of all times in her entire showbiz career.In addition to that, it was such a shame that Jamie's boyfriend Brandon(Michael Sarrazin)or the police could protect her from the obsessed perverted sexual predator Derek Sanford(Andrew Stevens)or that Jamie couldn't even get a restraining order against her stalker either.Even though I was glad to see Derek finally get killed off at the conclusion of the movie, it was kind of sad at the same time without a happy ending since a lot of people got hurt and/or even killed in the process throughout Jamie's whole ordeal with Derek.What I don't understand is, Jamie was a rich anchorwoman who had everything, including a snazzy car, a nice and well-respected job, a luxurious lifestyle, a swanky house, except protection and privacy, but I find it kind of bizarre why she didn't at least have a private security guard or something with as much danger and harrasment she was getting from her spy.Something else I found to be quite baffling was why Derek was so insistent about wanting Jamie for his girlfriend without at least even giving other cute chicks a chance to go out with him, especially when there were obviously numerous cute gals throwing themselves at Derek who thought he was drop-dead gorgeous and how Derek still didn't learn after Jamie's boyfriend(Brandon)beat the crap out of Derek by beating him to a pulp, but I guess that was the purpose of this movie in order to keep the suspense going to keep people interested in the movie the whole time along with the fact that things aren't always so practical nor make a lot of sense in the movies.This movie also takes me all the way back to memory lane to when we had the recession going on back in 1981-1982 when Ronald Reagan was the president along with the fact that I was 9 years old in the 3rd grade at Rockwood Elementary School in Calexico, CA when this movie was released in the

206588,A11BCJJG91KVOY,6300186822,"tmp ""snippy reviewer""","[1, 2]","No, this isn't a good movie.  It's a bad mish-mash of ""Vertigo"", ""Lipstick"" and ""Body Double"" despite predating the last one by a good two years.  The direction is TV movie of the week, the extra's acting is fairly atrocious and the script has holes Morgan Fairchild could park her little Fiat convertible in (for instance, the police call with the name of her stalker and his phone number, but fail to mention that he lives right up the street?)  Add in a soundtrack that's completely looped in (witness the scene at the diner), a bad ""Pino Donaggio does Bernard Herrmann"" score and Andrew Stevens heaving and sweating as the main looney and I defy you not to have a good time.  Then of course there's Morgan Fairchild.  I might be biased, because I think Miss Fairchild is great; she seems like a gal that would be a blast on the next barstool.  She is of course lovely and this movie lives and breathes on her creamy flesh.  Would that she would have gotten some real parts; she could have easily inhabited some of the complex Hitchcock blondes.
