Even the the dynamic between Jane and Thor is hilarious at times. Then there is the tragic aspect, the fight and difficulty, it is not easy for Thor, he struggles in terms of power and intellect, you feel his emotions as he deals with the heavy responsibilities that have fallen on his shoulders.Not your average 15 year old boy movie, very likable for all ages.I hate cliffhangers but this one is tolerable.",5,Surprising!

1566123,AJOF6MLUKKLFZ,B008JFUS0U,Adam,"[0, 0]","In Thor: The Dark World, Thor at last returns to Earth when Jane Foster's in trouble. Thor finds she's been infected by the Aether, a powerful world destroying force that could allow the Malekith, the ruler of Dark Elves to bring all nine realms into darkness. The war takes a personal toll for Thor, who comes with a plan to defeat Malekith. However, the plan requires he defy his father and obtain Loki's help.While Marvel films set on Earth have a similar feel to them, everything is different in Asgard. It just has a whole different fantasy feel to it and they really make it work with this great back story.Marvel really struck the right balance with the tone. There are some serious moments in this story, and the relationships between the characters are real and interesting.However, the movie manages to have this while not becoming too dark and brooding. Marvel movies tend to take certain things very seriously such as friendship, loyalty, and heroism without taking itself too serious. Thor is an awesome hero who is just fun to watch, particularly in the last battle against Malekith.The one thing that bothered me is that the movie left many unresolved threads. I hope they're resolved in Thor 3 and not in Avengers 2 as Asgard and Ultron shouldn't really mix.Overall, this was a good movie but not a great one. It's not Casablanca, Citizen Kane, or even Superman: The Movie. It won't make anyone all time lists for anything. It won't be one critics will think a lot about in 20 years, but it'll survive because it's great entertainment.

But whenever Tom Hiddleston's Loki appears onscreen I immediately get interested. Hiddleston seems to be playing the only character with believable emotions, or maybe he just makes them believable. (Though Kat Dennings as Darcy, Jane's intern, was very cute and funny.)  Hiddleston brings his considerable talent and training to Loki, plus a spark, an excitement, that I haven't seen him bring to his other roles, though I plan to keep looking.But, because of Hiddleston, it's definitely a movie worth watching. They spent $170,000,000 on it and it's all on the screen. But it's still a yawn unless Loki is present. But he's there a lot. (Spoiler!!) I'm looking forward to the next movie in this franchise just for Loki and going back and re-viewing the previous ones, just for him. There's a nice set of cast interviews, including Hiddelston, in the bonus features.The saddest part of the movie is Christopher Eccleston , who played the first Doctor Who in the reboot. But he's under a ton of makeup and speaking, mostly, non-English dialogue, and he just disappears. I've read they cut his role and added more to HIddleston's Loki.

1566181,A3LTZGHZBBBQX0,B008JFUS0U,Anthony L.,"[171, 192]","If you would have told me in 2010, that a Shakesperean director, a hunky Australian, and a tall British TV actor would craft a hugely popular and profitable franchise centered around the Nordic gods...I would have asked what you were smoking. Today, it is clear that Marvel, under the lead of Kevin Feige, has crafted a winning formula that clearly works. The keys to Marvel's box office success include their careful building, relatable characters, and the fact that they are not afraid to mix genres, AND have fun while doing all of it. Thor 2: The Dark World follows this formula to a T (a big T, shaped like a hammer...). But that doesn't matter, because as I said before, the formula WORKS.Well, not ALL of it works. The scientific mumbo-jumbo (courtesy of Portman and Skarsgard) is, quite frankly, embarrassing, and while Christopher Eccleston's Malekith may look like the badass lovechild of Nosferatu and Legolas, he's far from a compelling villain. This is not to mention a certain Deux ex Machina that rather staggers disbelief.But enough of cons! Thor 2, headed by the gritty sensibilities of Alan Taylor (Game of Thrones), takes the world built by Kenneth Branagh, and ups the stakes, the chemistry, and the characters to new heights! It takes place in a fully realized and visually stunning world (look out for Iceland doubling as the realm of the dark elves), but never loses it's fantastic touch. Chris Hemsworth is (quite literally, erm) solid as Thor, but it is his supporting cast are the true scene stealers. Tom Hiddleston's devilishly good Loki is a highlight; scheming, tricking, and lying his way through the movie, all with a glint in his green eyes and an air of sarcasm. Thor 2 would not be half of what it is without Hiddleston. It's refreshing to see some brains instead of brawn in a superhero movie.Another reason to to thank the gods is the expanding of Idris Elba's (that awesome charisma machine) character Heimdall, who, if not managing to *cancel* the apocalypse, at least delays it until further notice. Anthony Hopkins is gravely overqualified, but who cares - it's Hopkins and he's always excellent. Jamie Alexander, Rene Russo, and Natalie Portman each out-do their previous performances, and Kat Dennings is still absolutely hilarious. This is the most female-centric Marvel movie yet.The action, including a dazzling aerial fight in Asgard, a brutal battle in an Asgardian prison, a twisty, unpredictable corker of a double-cross in the dark world, and a visually stunning and often hilarious climax of a battle...is some of the best I have seen Marvel put forth yet. It was always riveting and much appreciated.In conclusion, Thor 2 sticks very closely to the tried-and-proven Marvel formula, meaning that there are some glitches and cliches. But on the whole, this is the best Marvel movie since The Avengers, and one of Marvel's best (certainly outpassing IM2, IM3, THOR, and HULK). Leave your brain at the door and enjoy. Thor 2 is a triumph. 4.5 convergences out of 5!PS: As a total Norse mythology nut, I absolutely LOVED the mentions to Svartalfaheimr, Yggdrasil, and Midgard. I definitely recommend checking out the original myths; it makes the work Marvel has done so much more worthwhile!

Ray Stevenson (&#34;Rome&#34; & &#34;Kill the Irishman&#34;), Tadanobu Asano (&#34;Battleship&#34; & &#34;47 Ronin&#34;) and Zachary Levi (&#34;Chuck&#34;) wonderfully expand on their previous roles of Volstagg, Hogun, and Fandral.

The abundant action is well paced and exciting. The romance was touching, funny and competitive. There are mysteries to keep you guessing. Several surprises and one very un-expected shock. Previously seen characters are allowed to expand. New characters are introduced. Depicted violence is appropriate. Partial nudity was fleeting and very comical. And therein lies what may be this movies greatest achievement. The comedial element laced throughout is exceptionally well done.There are two cameos along the way. One pleasantly expected while the other was quite unexpected and hilarious. This is a Marvel movie so you know there are going to be hidden treats.

Despite an almost overload of secondary characters, each one feels essential to their moment in the story. While different from the previous film, it picks up right where &#34;Avengers&#34; left off in terms of story and feel. The dynamic between Thor and Loki wasn't the usual &#34;let's just fight all the time&#34; thing, and you got the feeling that perhaps they had indeed been close at one time in their lives rather than just always enemies.There is a moment in the film that is the galvanizing hinge to bring Loki into the fight. The &#34;Coulson&#34; moment (to borrow an idea from &#34;Avengers&#34;) doesn't feel like a plot device or like it was thrown in for shock value. Instead, it's a logical progression for the characters and their world.Yes, it's a breathless film when it finally takes off, and it can get a little overwhelming with all the stuff going on, but even then it just feels like a great next step in Marvel films after &#34;Avengers&#34;. &#34;Iron Man 3&#34; was a faltering step for Marvel this year, but this moving gives me hope for what's ahead in the Marvel movie universe.

And, oh my, Tom Hiddleston, while he didn't quite steal the show his protrayal of Loki shows why actors love playing villains - they are just so much fun. And Stan Lee's cameo was a hoot.Actually the whole durn cast was pretty right on for me. Jamie Alexander as Sif didn't get enough screen time, nor did Idris Alba as Baldur, just to mention two. To adequately praise the individual cast members would require listing the entire cast.The production is what we've come to expect of Marvel, loud and explosive with new colors being invented every scene it seems. Asgard looks a lot like the Kirby-esque goth I remember from reading the comics as a kid, yet it also seemed more functional, like a real, breathing city that you'd actually want to visit.There are aspects of the storyline that are a little outre, but hey, it's essentially a motion comic and suspension of disbelief is mandatory when you buy the ticket. As much as I did dislike some of the plot elements I didn't dislike them all that much and they were internally consistent enough to not be too annoying.But the real story is the relationship between Thor and Loki and that story is so satisfying.

There seems to be no end to the public's desire for individual superhero movies as well as gathering them all together for ""Avengers"" movies. ""Avengers: The Age of Ultron"" is slated to release in 2015. This has been cause for some criticism as some of the individual movies are more tie-in than stand alone films.I'm the first to admit that many of these Marvel movies appear to me to be more money-making ventures than exercises in good film-making. Sure, all movies are money-making ventures, but some of these films were hampered by lazy scripts and events that are just there to string you along to the next movie or to sit through long stretches of movie with sparse action, watching talking heads or even montages of events.""Thor"" was the movie I was least excited about, having been an Iron Man fan growing up, but it was ""Thor"" that I actually ended up enjoying the most out of all the films. It wasn't lazy film-making, it had a good script, they didn't sell the viewer short with a superhero incapacitated or give you an hour of film where the only action is a superhero shooting fruit while drunk. Most importantly, they had a story to tell that engrossed the entire film.""Thor: The Dark World"", for lack of better words, makes all of the other Marvel films, with the exception of ""Avengers"", look like they were made by amateurs with good equipment. Just as I was growing tired of superhero films (and I'm a huge fan), ""Thor: The Dark World"" shattered all of that. It is quite simply the most complete action/adventure film I have seen in years. Not only did the movie have a good story to tell, it was loaded with charm and skillful creativity from top to bottom.You want films to take you there and not remind you that you went somewhere until its over and ""Thor: The Dark World"" did that on all levels. I haven't sat through a film with such joy and involvement and forgotten my critical eye since I was a teenager. It was an effects and visual marvel and never once did I think they were trying to cheap out the viewer with a lazy script. ""Thor: The Dark World"" let it all hang out and in the process, they may have created one of the most complete and entertaining films in decades. It was funny, frightening, exciting, intelligent, intriguing and a movie not to be missed, even if you aren't a follower of the Marvel series.",5,PURE ESCAPISM I haven't felt in a long time,1384128000,"11 11, 2013",2013,2495,"['Thor', 'Dark', 'World', 'addition', 'on-going', 'series', 'Marvel', 'superhero', 'movies', 'have', 'displayed', 'uncanny', 'knack', 'longevity', 'success', 'be', 'end', 'public', 'desire', 'individual', 'superhero', 'movies', 'as', 'well', 'gathering', 'together', 'Avengers', 'movies', 'Avengers', 'Age', 'Ultron', 'slated', 'release', '2015', 'been', 'cause', 'criticism', 'individual', 'movies', 'are', 'more', 'tie-in', 'stand', 'alone', 'films.I', ""'m"", 'first', 'admit', 'many', 'Marvel', 'movies', 'appear', 'be', 'more', 'money-making', 'ventures', 'exercises', 'good', 'film-making', 'Sure', 'movies', 'are', 'money-making', 'ventures', 'films', 'were', 'hampered', 'lazy', 'scripts', 'events', 'are', 'just', 'there', 'string', 'next', 'movie', 'sit', 'long', 'stretches', 'movie', 'sparse', 'action', 'watching', 'talking', 'heads', 'even', 'montages', 'events', 'Thor', 'was', 'movie', 'was', 'least', 'excited', 'having', 'been', 'Iron', 'Man', 'fan', 'growing', 'up', 'was', 'Thor', 'actually', 'ended', 'up', 'enjoying', 'most', 'films', 'was', ""n't"", 'lazy', 'film-making', 'had', 'good', 'script', 'did', ""n't"", 'sell', 'viewer', 'short', 'superhero', 'incapacitated', 'give', 'hour', 'film', 'where', 'only', 'action', 'superhero', 'shooting', 'fruit', 'drunk', 'Most', 'importantly', 'had', 'story', 'tell', 'engrossed', 'entire', 'film', 'Thor', 'Dark', 'World', 'lack', 'better', 'words', 'other', 'Marvel', 'films', 'exception', 'Avengers', 'look', 'were', 'made', 'amateurs', 'good', 'equipment', 'Just', 'was', 'growing', 'tired', 'superhero', 'films', ""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'Thor', 'Dark', 'World', 'shattered', 'quite', 'simply', 'most', 'complete', 'action/adventure', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'years', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'movie', 'have', 'good', 'story', 'tell', 'was', 'loaded', 'charm', 'skillful', 'creativity', 'top', 'bottom.You', 'want', 'films', 'take', 'there', 'not', 'remind', 'went', 'somewhere', 'Thor', 'Dark', 'World', 'did', 'levels', 'have', ""n't"", 'sat', 'film', 'such', 'joy', 'involvement', 'forgotten', 'critical', 'eye', 'was', 'teenager', 'was', 'effects', 'visual', 'marvel', 'never', 'once', 'did', 'think', 'were', 'trying', 'cheap', 'out', 'viewer', 'lazy', 'script', 'Thor', 'Dark', 'World', 'let', 'hang', 'out', 'process', 'may', 'have', 'created', 'one', 'most', 'complete', 'entertaining', 'films', 'decades', 'was', 'funny', 'frightening', 'exciting', 'intelligent', 'intriguing', 'movie', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'even', 'are', ""n't"", 'follower', 'Marvel', 'series']",N/A

1566286,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B008JFUS0U,C. Sawin,"[4, 7]","It's not that ""Thor: The Dark World"" is any less extravagant than ""Thor"" since you still spend a fair amount of time in Asgard and it's still just as impressive as it was in the first film, but ""Thor: The Dark World"" is a darker film in comparison. This seems like an obvious statement since the enemy of the film is Malekith and his Dark Elves while Aether is a form of dark energy, but the visuals in the film are extremely dark. The time spent in Svartalfeim can contribute to this since the realm is volcanic and ashy. However the entire film seems to purposely be coated in this dark filter and isn't nearly as bright and vibrant as ""Thor"" is.Depending on how you felt about the cast the first time around, the superhero sequel is unlikely to waiver your opinion one way or another. Tom Hiddleston aims for the moon with his performance and doesn't disappoint. Loki is a powerhouse in ""Thor: The Dark World."" With his unpredictable nature and ceaseless trickery, Loki is a character that everyone seems to love and for good reason. His commentary is worth the price of admission alone. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje is fantastic as Kurse, but it's mostly due to how superb his costume and prosthetics are. Tadanobu Asano gets even less screen time than he did in the first film and Christopher Eccleston is solid as Malekith, but it's the way the character is written that's disappointing. At the end of the day, looking past all the bells and whistles of the Aether, Malekith is basically a pushover. Bringing back Rene Russo as Thor's mother Frigga is also a confusing addition, especially with how her story arc plays out. Aside from a couple really enjoyable cameos in the film, the appearance of Chris O'Dowd was quite a pleasant surprise especially if you're a fan of ""The IT Crowd.""It's intriguing to consider that ""Thor: The Dark World"" has a slightly higher budget than its predecessor since the original film is so much flashier in comparison. The Dark Elves, Kurse, the spaceship battles, and the Aether must have cost a pretty penny. The Aether is constantly moving, flows like a liquid, and is red in appearance. So when it takes over Jane's body and she starts having visions about how this red river inside her is going to destroy the universe, you can't help but choke back jokes about Jane's monthly visitor. Next to their impressive space crafts, The Dark Elves have alien weaponry like spears that shoot lasers and black hole grenades that are extremely fun to watch in action.""Thor: The Dark World"" feels like a different film than ""Thor."" There's this somber atmosphere in the sequel that seems to always hint at impending doom. While Malekith seems to be threatening the existence of everything, he's dealt with so easily. Thor is torn between restoring order to the nine realms, the love of his life, and taking over his father's throne. So why does so much time seem to be given to Kat Dennings, her intern, and Stellan Skarsgard running around naked in Stonehenge?""Thor: The Dark World"" is visually enticing, but in a more ominous way than in the first film. With extraordinary special effects and an inclusive story, ""Thor: The Dark World"" is sure to be well-liked by those who loved the first film and a must-see for any fan of the Marvel Studios films but fails to be as exhilarating and as well done as ""Thor.""",4,The house that Loki built,1384041600,"11 10, 2013",2013,3339,"['not', 'Thor', 'Dark', 'World', 'less', 'extravagant', 'Thor', 'still', 'spend', 'fair', 'amount', 'time', 'Asgard', 'still', 'just', 'as', 'impressive', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'Thor', 'Dark', 'World', 'darker', 'film', 'comparison', 'obvious', 'statement', 'enemy', 'film', 'Malekith', 'Dark', 'Elves', 'Aether', 'form', 'dark', 'energy', 'visuals', 'film', 'are', 'extremely', 'dark', 'time', 'spent', 'Svartalfeim', 'can', 'contribute', 'realm', 'volcanic', 'ashy', 'However', 'entire', 'film', 'purposely', 'be', 'coated', 'dark', 'filter', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'bright', 'vibrant', 'Thor', 'is.Depending', 'how', 'felt', 'cast', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'superhero', 'sequel', 'unlikely', 'waiver', 'opinion', 'one', 'way', 'Tom', 'Hiddleston', 'moon', 'performance', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'Loki', 'powerhouse', 'Thor', 'Dark', 'World', 'unpredictable', 'nature', 'ceaseless', 'trickery', 'Loki', 'character', 'everyone', 'love', 'good', 'reason', 'commentary', 'price', 'admission', 'alone', 'Adewale', 'Akinnuoye-Agbaje', 'fantastic', 'Kurse', 'mostly', 'due', 'how', 'superb', 'costume', 'prosthetics', 'are', 'Tadanobu', 'Asano', 'even', 'less', 'screen', 'time', 'did', 'first', 'film', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'solid', 'Malekith', 'way', 'character', 'written', 'disappointing', 'end', 'day', 'looking', 'bells', 'whistles', 'Aether', 'Malekith', 'basically', 'pushover', 'Bringing', 'back', 'Rene', 'Russo', 'Thor', 'mother', 'Frigga', 'also', 'confusing', 'addition', 'especially', 'how', 'story', 'arc', 'out', 'Aside', 'couple', 'really', 'enjoyable', 'cameos', 'film', 'appearance', 'Chris', ""O'Dowd"", 'was', 'quite', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'especially', ""'re"", 'fan', 'IT', 'Crowd', 'intriguing', 'consider', 'Thor', 'Dark', 'World', 'slightly', 'higher', 'budget', 'predecessor', 'original', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'flashier', 'comparison', 'Dark', 'Elves', 'Kurse', 'spaceship', 'battles', 'Aether', 'must', 'have', 'cost', 'pretty', 'penny', 'Aether', 'constantly', 'moving', 'liquid', 'red', 'appearance', 'So', 'when', 'Jane', 'body', 'having', 'visions', 'how', 'red', 'river', 'going', 'destroy', 'universe', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'choke', 'back', 'jokes', 'Jane', 'monthly', 'visitor', 'Next', 'impressive', 'space', 'crafts', 'Dark', 'Elves', 'have', 'alien', 'weaponry', 'spears', 'shoot', 'lasers', 'black', 'hole', 'grenades', 'are', 'extremely', 'fun', 'watch', 'action', 'Thor', 'Dark', 'World', 'feels', 'different', 'film', 'Thor', 'somber', 'atmosphere', 'sequel', 'always', 'hint', 'impending', 'doom', 'Malekith', 'be', 'threatening', 'existence', 'everything', 'dealt', 'so', 'easily', 'Thor', 'torn', 'restoring', 'order', 'nine', 'realms', 'love', 'life', 'taking', 'over', 'father', 'throne', 'So', 'why', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'seem', 'be', 'given', 'Kat', 'Dennings', 'intern', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgard', 'running', 'around', 'naked', 'Stonehenge', 'Thor', 'Dark', 'World', 'visually', 'enticing', 'more', 'ominous', 'way', 'first', 'film', 'extraordinary', 'special', 'effects', 'inclusive', 'story', 'Thor', 'Dark', 'World', 'sure', 'be', 'well-liked', 'who', 'loved', 'first', 'film', 'must-see', 'fan', 'Marvel', 'Studios', 'films', 'be', 'exhilarating', 'as', 'well', 'done', 'Thor']",N/A

Oh: and a group of evil elves, who were banished generations ago, have returned to claim a magical substance and basically wreck havoc across multiple universes or something.Director Alan Taylor isn't trying to fill AVENGER'S epic shoes (in the way, say, the flawed IRON MAN 3 did).  Taylor's simply going back to THOR's original cinematic territory: witty dialogue, splashy battle sequences, and Chris Hemsworth's charismatic portrayal.  Athony Hopkins returns, hamming it up; and Christopher Eccleston makes a welcome appearance as the main bad, though his performance is almost utterly lost (anyone could've played the role, the way it's written and edited).  Ultimately, if you're looking for a little mindless fun, with solid performances (and a killer mid-credits scene...seriously, stick around, folks, for a look at an upcoming Marvel film), THOR: THE DARK WORLD is worth a couple hours.",4,"""That's Thor out there, waving his hammer around and everything!""",1393372800,"02 26, 2014",2014,1781,"['THOR', 'DARK', 'WORLD', 'out', 'quite', 'first', 'film', 'splashy', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'ultimately', 'superficial', 'comic', 'book', 'film', 'tremendous', 'effects', 'charismatic', 'actors', 'predictable', 'plot', 'points', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'about', ""'re"", 'having', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'Oh', 'Tom', 'Hiddleston', 'stealing', 'practically', 'scene', 'likable', 'unreliable', 'Loki.This', 'film', 'up', 'events', 'THE', 'AVENGERS', 'record', 'much', 'superior', 'film', 'not', 'anyone', 'really', 'comparing', 'here', 'Loki', 'being', 'held', 'prisoner', 'Asgard', 'alive', 'only', 'whims', 'adopted', 'mother', 'Rene', 'Russo', 'Loki', 'brother', 'titular', 'hero', 'fighting', 'wars', 'cleaning', 'up', 'aftermath', 'what', 'happened', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'places', 'Thor', 'estranged', 'gal', 'pal', 'Jane', 'Foster', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'feeling', 'little', 'lonely', 'scientist/mentor/friend', 'Erik', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgard', 'running', 'around', 'naked', 'Oh', 'group', 'evil', 'elves', 'who', 'were', 'banished', 'generations', 'ago', 'have', 'returned', 'claim', 'magical', 'substance', 'basically', 'wreck', 'havoc', 'multiple', 'universes', 'something.Director', 'Alan', 'Taylor', ""n't"", 'trying', 'fill', 'AVENGER', 'epic', 'shoes', 'way', 'say', 'flawed', 'IRON', 'MAN', '3', 'did', 'Taylor', 'simply', 'going', 'back', 'THOR', 'original', 'cinematic', 'territory', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'splashy', 'battle', 'sequences', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'charismatic', 'portrayal', 'Athony', 'Hopkins', 'returns', 'hamming', 'up', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'welcome', 'appearance', 'main', 'bad', 'performance', 'almost', 'utterly', 'lost', 'anyone', 'could', ""'ve"", 'played', 'role', 'way', 'written', 'edited', 'Ultimately', ""'re"", 'looking', 'little', 'mindless', 'fun', 'solid', 'performances', 'killer', 'mid-credits', 'scene', 'seriously', 'stick', 'around', 'folks', 'look', 'upcoming', 'Marvel', 'film', 'THOR', 'DARK', 'WORLD', 'couple', 'hours']",N/A

If you had to ask me my favorite Marvel character, Thor would be pretty far down the list, but I still thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Once again, the acting was solid all around. There is less of a character journey for Thor this go around as he has settled in to his humbler and more thoughtful warrior role, but we do see some new dimensions to the Loki character. We get to see a lot more of Asgard and Thor&#8217;s family this time around. There are lots of scenes where you can easily believe you are watching a Lord of the Rings style fantasy, but the underlying science fiction is still there, especially in the final act. The climactic battle includes some very creative use of space portals to make the fight different than anything I have ever seen before. I believe there are even more moments of humor than the first, and all are well placed and well delivered.One question I had going into the movie was how would they create a significant enough threat to match the power levels of Thor, but at the same time making it plausible that the other Avengers wouldn&#8217;t become involved. Given that we have this connected universe, it makes sense that if something major goes down on Earth all the Avengers would once again assemble. Thor: The Dark World gets around this pretty well by putting a very short clock on the action happening on Earth, so that it is easy to believe nobody else would have time to react, thus leaving Thor to handle this threat without any Avengers backup.

1566304,A3QU74B9N0830G,B008JFUS0U,Dan Thompson,"[3, 6]","As part of their ever-expanding and ambitious film series, Marvel Studios brings us ""Thor: The Dark World"", the second film in Phase Two of Marvel's Cinematic Universe and the third overall to feature the God of Thunder. With a new director at the helm, and showcasing the typical humor and action that fans of the studio have come to expect, ""Thor: The Dark World"" proves it's a worthy and enjoyable addition to the Marvel universe.The story finds our hero fighting to restore order in the aftermath of ""Thor"" and ""Marvel's The Avengers"", as chaos and rebellions have erupted throughout the Nine Realms. As battles are fought and uprisings are quenched, an ancient race known as the Dark Elves awakens to seek vengeance on Asgard and destroy the universe. Faced with an unknown enemy and a weapon that seemingly can't be destroyed, Thor desperately seeks out the help of the traitor Loki in hopes to restore order to the cosmos.In his third outing as the title character, it's clear that Chris Hemsworth is more than comfortable in playing the mighty hero, delivering witty one-liners and bone-crunching punches with ease. His acting chops have increased since he first picked up the hammer, which is a good thing because this sequel gives him a lot more to work with, both emotionally and physically. His relationships with Loki (played brilliantly, once again, by Tom Hiddleston) and Jane Foster (the lovely Natalie Portman) are explored quite a bit here, which is a good thing considering the great chemistry between a cast chalk-full of returning actors. Along with a great cast, another element the film has going for it is director Alan Taylor, of HBO's ""Game of Thrones"" fame, who accomplishes the difficult task of balancing the fantasy elements of the film with a good character-driven story. There's no doubt his work on GoT helped punch up the battle scenes in the film, especially the large-scale ones.There's a lot of fun to be had in this sequel, more so, in my opinion, than the origin story that proceeds it. Although the first half is a bit slow to introduce the stakes and backstory of the movie, the film really finds itself at the halfway point by exploring the complicated relationship between Thor and Loki. Overall the sequel contains a lot of fun moments, high-stakes action sequences, a terrific cast, and strong direction, making the film a thoroughly enjoyable one.",4,The God of Thunder Returns!,1383955200,"11 9, 2013",2013,2393,"['part', 'ever-expanding', 'ambitious', 'film', 'series', 'Marvel', 'Studios', 'Thor', 'Dark', 'World', 'second', 'film', 'Phase', 'Two', 'Marvel', 'Cinematic', 'Universe', 'third', 'overall', 'feature', 'God', 'Thunder', 'new', 'director', 'helm', 'showcasing', 'typical', 'humor', 'action', 'fans', 'studio', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'Thor', 'Dark', 'World', 'worthy', 'enjoyable', 'addition', 'Marvel', 'universe.The', 'story', 'hero', 'fighting', 'restore', 'order', 'aftermath', 'Thor', 'Marvel', 'Avengers', 'chaos', 'rebellions', 'have', 'erupted', 'Nine', 'Realms', 'battles', 'are', 'fought', 'uprisings', 'are', 'quenched', 'ancient', 'race', 'known', 'Dark', 'Elves', 'seek', 'vengeance', 'Asgard', 'destroy', 'universe', 'Faced', 'unknown', 'enemy', 'weapon', 'seemingly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'destroyed', 'Thor', 'desperately', 'out', 'help', 'traitor', 'Loki', 'hopes', 'restore', 'order', 'cosmos.In', 'third', 'outing', 'title', 'character', 'clear', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'more', 'comfortable', 'playing', 'mighty', 'hero', 'delivering', 'witty', 'one-liners', 'bone-crunching', 'punches', 'ease', 'acting', 'chops', 'have', 'increased', 'first', 'picked', 'up', 'hammer', 'good', 'thing', 'sequel', 'lot', 'more', 'work', 'emotionally', 'physically', 'relationships', 'Loki', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'once', 'again', 'Tom', 'Hiddleston', 'Jane', 'Foster', 'lovely', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'are', 'explored', 'quite', 'bit', 'here', 'good', 'thing', 'considering', 'great', 'chemistry', 'cast', 'chalk-full', 'returning', 'actors', 'great', 'cast', 'element', 'film', 'going', 'director', 'Alan', 'Taylor', 'HBO', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'fame', 'who', 'difficult', 'task', 'balancing', 'fantasy', 'elements', 'film', 'good', 'character-driven', 'story', 'doubt', 'work', 'GoT', 'helped', 'punch', 'up', 'battle', 'scenes', 'film', 'especially', 'large-scale', 'ones.There', 'lot', 'fun', 'be', 'had', 'sequel', 'more', 'so', 'opinion', 'origin', 'story', 'first', 'half', 'bit', 'slow', 'introduce', 'stakes', 'backstory', 'movie', 'film', 'really', 'halfway', 'point', 'exploring', 'complicated', 'relationship', 'Thor', 'Loki', 'Overall', 'sequel', 'lot', 'fun', 'moments', 'high-stakes', 'action', 'sequences', 'terrific', 'cast', 'strong', 'direction', 'making', 'film', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'one']",N/A

Thor's father, the King is so clueless, you wonder how his kingdom ever achieved its greatness. I thought the Queen was the most compelling character in the entire movie, and her part only lasted about 10 minutes.  About the actor playing Thor: either you love him or hate him. I was reading and loving Thor comic books over 40 years ago. The actor here has more of the presence of a beefed up Chippindale dancer than as a noble, crusade-driven super hero. He is just too enamored of his great looks, one gets the impression--very similar to the actor in the first Captain America movie. There was just no drama--you knew Thor would defeat the bad-guys. And, there was insufficient back-story on the bad guys, certainly not enough to get the viewer to dislike them or to fear them as formidable enough to get us thinking that Thor might not prevail.

Though Earth still factors into the mix, particularly in the clever, gripping climactic fight scene, there's no mistaking that this is Asgard's story and that clear emphasis, missing from the original, makes a big difference. As a distinctly fantasy-laden epic, it also benefits from a fresh, authentic flavor that its stable-mates just can't match. There's more to see than smashed skyscrapers and flattened taxi cabs in Thor's world, and that brand of open possibility makes the realm an absolute delight to swallow up. As visual feasts go, this is at or near the top of the pile - it's gorgeous, innovative and generally unlike anything else in modern cinema, a stuffed bagful of sensory treats. The acting, too, has taken a grand step up since our last trip across the rainbow bridge. Surprisingly, this time Natalie Portman comes across as a clunky third wheel: Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston provide the real intrigue, hammering home Thor's complicated relationship with his conniving adopted brother, Loki.

1566363,A3DBUN9EMFMUV1,B008JFUS0U,"Elias B. ""The Atlanta Fried Critic""","[8, 24]","The quality of the first ""Thor"" entry is often a point of contention among a good deal of people and myself. Personally, I found Branagh's film to be energetic and lively, with a fantastic cast bolstered by solid direction and an entertainingly cheesy plot. Many people don't share that viewpoint in the slightest, I came to find out. Regardless, that didn't damper my excitement for the follow-up, which has a different director but the same writers. It's a shame, then, that after seeing this on opening night, the first phrase that came out of my mouth was, ""Well, that kind of sucked."" Because despite all of its best efforts, ""Thor: The Dark World"" suffers from a sophomore slump that undercuts any of the film's strong points.After the events of ""The Avengers,"" Thor has been patrolling the nine realms in an attempt to keep interdimensional peace. Loki has been locked in away in a cell, and Jane Foster has been... well, apparently trying to step up her dating game, despite still pining for her pretty-boy Asgardian prince. But all of this is threatened by the introduction of the Dark Elves, an ancient race of warriors whom Odin presumed to be dead after he ravaged their world with the restraint of a crazed elephant. In a predictable twist, the Dark Elves invade Asgard, kill a lot of people, and severely anger Thor and Loki to the point where they end up working together. Also, Jane gets possessed by some ancient parasitic weapon, the laws of physics start failing in London, and the Earth is on the verge of getting destroyed.As you can probably tell from my less than excited tone about the plot, this movie's narrative is a complete snore-fest when held in comparison to the first one. The writers have simply tried to tackle way too much in way too short of a running time, which results in a film that feels simultaneously plodding and rushed. Casualties of this flawed narrative include entire subplots that get introduced, then dropped with no abandon. We're supposed to be led that there's an elaborate love triangle, that Loki has some sinister plan being carefully plotted out, that physics going berserk is because of a certain reason. But when the credits begin to roll, it feels like we've only seen about 1/4 of the story. Altogether, this film feels incredibly unfocused and incomplete, and for the second time in the Marvel Universe films (the first being the ""Captain America""), it felt like I was watching a two hour trailer for the next ""Avengers"" film.The other problem with this film is the absolutely unbelievable love story. Despite both being great actors in their own right, Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman simply have no chemistry together as the lovers from other worlds. When they kiss, it feels forced, and their ""romantic"" dialogue made me feel as if I was being forcefed sugar from a funnel. It's almost unbearable to watch them interact at times, which is a bit saddening when their chemistry in the first film was pretty convincing.At least the acting and fighting keep things moving along. Tom Hiddleston is especially wonderful as Loki, finally showing a commitment to the role that I quite frankly didn't know he had. The energy between him and Hemsworth is dynamic, and honestly, it feels like they have more chemistry together than Portman and Hemsworth. Other actors, including Rene Russo and Anthony Hopkins, are also top-notch here, and the inclusion of reliable Chris O'Dowd is also welcome. Aside from the acting, we have some pretty entertaining fights bolstered by lavish special effects, the best of which is the admittedly enthralling final brawl in London. What undercuts this, however, is when the film tries to be a low-rent ""Star Wars"" and implement downright stupid aircraft battles in Asgard, complete with faceless warriors carrying lasers, laser-blasting cannons, and laser turrets. Oh, and the main villain can essentially use the Force. I wish I was making this stuff up, but I'm not. It was if the writers didn't know what genre movie was, and artificially tried to appeal to as many demographics as possible.The result of this is a film that falls flat on its face harder than Thor's Mjolnir. Some parts of this movie are genuinely entertaining and fun, but not enough to merit the ticket price, and certainly not enough to merit owning it on home video. ""Thor: The Dark World"" is not an awful movie, but simply a very dull one, one that is nowhere nearly as engaging and fun as its predecessor. With a rushed plot, forced romance, and an ending that feels like a cheap ripoff, there are a lot better things you could spend your money on going to see this month.Overall: C",3,Thundering Bore,1383955200,"11 9, 2013",2013,4652,"['quality', 'first', 'Thor', 'entry', 'often', 'point', 'contention', 'good', 'deal', 'people', 'Personally', 'found', 'Branagh', 'film', 'be', 'energetic', 'lively', 'fantastic', 'cast', 'bolstered', 'solid', 'direction', 'entertainingly', 'cheesy', 'plot', 'Many', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'share', 'viewpoint', 'slightest', 'came', 'find', 'out', 'Regardless', 'did', ""n't"", 'damper', 'excitement', 'follow-up', 'different', 'director', 'same', 'writers', 'shame', 'then', 'seeing', 'opening', 'night', 'first', 'phrase', 'came', 'mouth', 'was', 'Well', 'kind', 'sucked', 'best', 'efforts', 'Thor', 'Dark', 'World', 'suffers', 'sophomore', 'slump', 'film', 'strong', 'points.After', 'events', 'Avengers', 'Thor', 'been', 'patrolling', 'nine', 'realms', 'attempt', 'keep', 'interdimensional', 'peace', 'Loki', 'been', 'locked', 'away', 'cell', 'Jane', 'Foster', 'been', 'well', 'apparently', 'trying', 'step', 'up', 'dating', 'game', 'still', 'pining', 'pretty-boy', 'Asgardian', 'prince', 'threatened', 'introduction', 'Dark', 'Elves', 'ancient', 'race', 'warriors', 'whom', 'Odin', 'presumed', 'be', 'dead', 'ravaged', 'world', 'restraint', 'crazed', 'elephant', 'predictable', 'twist', 'Dark', 'Elves', 'invade', 'Asgard', 'kill', 'lot', 'people', 'severely', 'anger', 'Thor', 'Loki', 'point', 'where', 'end', 'up', 'working', 'together', 'Also', 'Jane', 'possessed', 'ancient', 'parasitic', 'weapon', 'laws', 'physics', 'start', 'failing', 'London', 'Earth', 'verge', 'getting', 'destroyed.As', 'can', 'probably', 'tell', 'less', 'excited', 'tone', 'plot', 'movie', 'narrative', 'complete', 'snore-fest', 'when', 'held', 'comparison', 'first', 'one', 'writers', 'have', 'simply', 'tried', 'tackle', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'way', 'too', 'short', 'running', 'time', 'results', 'film', 'simultaneously', 'plodding', 'rushed', 'Casualties', 'flawed', 'narrative', 'include', 'entire', 'subplots', 'get', 'introduced', 'then', 'dropped', 'abandon', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'be', 'led', 'elaborate', 'love', 'triangle', 'Loki', 'sinister', 'plan', 'being', 'carefully', 'plotted', 'out', 'physics', 'going', 'berserk', 'certain', 'reason', 'when', 'credits', 'begin', 'roll', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', '1/4', 'story', 'Altogether', 'film', 'incredibly', 'unfocused', 'incomplete', 'second', 'time', 'Marvel', 'Universe', 'films', 'first', 'being', 'Captain', 'America', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'two', 'hour', 'trailer', 'next', 'Avengers', 'film.The', 'other', 'problem', 'film', 'absolutely', 'unbelievable', 'love', 'story', 'being', 'great', 'actors', 'own', 'right', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'simply', 'have', 'chemistry', 'together', 'lovers', 'other', 'worlds', 'When', 'kiss', 'forced', 'romantic', 'dialogue', 'made', 'feel', 'was', 'being', 'forcefed', 'sugar', 'funnel', 'almost', 'unbearable', 'watch', 'interact', 'times', 'bit', 'saddening', 'when', 'chemistry', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'pretty', 'convincing.At', 'least', 'acting', 'fighting', 'keep', 'things', 'moving', 'along', 'Tom', 'Hiddleston', 'especially', 'wonderful', 'Loki', 'finally', 'showing', 'commitment', 'role', 'quite', 'frankly', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'had', 'energy', 'Hemsworth', 'dynamic', 'honestly', 'have', 'more', 'chemistry', 'together', 'Portman', 'Hemsworth', 'Other', 'actors', 'including', 'Rene', 'Russo', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'are', 'also', 'top-notch', 'here', 'inclusion', 'reliable', 'Chris', ""O'Dowd"", 'also', 'welcome', 'Aside', 'acting', 'have', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'fights', 'bolstered', 'lavish', 'special', 'effects', 'best', 'admittedly', 'enthralling', 'final', 'brawl', 'London', 'What', 'however', 'when', 'film', 'tries', 'be', 'low-rent', 'Star', 'Wars', 'implement', 'downright', 'stupid', 'aircraft', 'battles', 'Asgard', 'complete', 'faceless', 'warriors', 'carrying', 'lasers', 'laser-blasting', 'cannons', 'laser', 'turrets', 'Oh', 'main', 'villain', 'can', 'essentially', 'use', 'Force', 'wish', 'was', 'making', 'stuff', 'up', ""'m"", 'not', 'was', 'writers', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'genre', 'movie', 'was', 'artificially', 'tried', 'appeal', 'many', 'demographics', 'possible.The', 'result', 'film', 'flat', 'face', 'harder', 'Thor', 'Mjolnir', 'parts', 'movie', 'are', 'genuinely', 'entertaining', 'fun', 'not', 'enough', 'merit', 'ticket', 'price', 'certainly', 'not', 'enough', 'merit', 'owning', 'home', 'video', 'Thor', 'Dark', 'World', 'not', 'awful', 'movie', 'simply', 'very', 'dull', 'one', 'one', 'nowhere', 'nearly', 'engaging', 'fun', 'predecessor', 'rushed', 'plot', 'forced', 'romance', 'ending', 'feels', 'cheap', 'ripoff', 'are', 'lot', 'better', 'things', 'could', 'spend', 'money', 'going', 'see', 'month.Overall', 'C']",N/A

1566381,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B008JFUS0U,FNDNreview,"[3, 7]","Phase One of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) slowly but surely gained momentum over the course of five films, eventually culminating with 2012&#8217;s summer blockbuster, Marvel&#8217;s The Avengers.  After creating arguably the greatest super hero film ever, the question quickly becomes, how do you top that?  Sequels are typically inferior films, but when it comes to the MCU, they simply keep getting better &#8211; at least in terms of financial earnings.  While not a direct sequel to The Avengers, Iron Man 3 performed well at the box office (highest grossing film of 2013), telling its own solo story but still picking up the subtle pieces in the aftermath of the Battle of New York.  Iron Man 3 also jump started Phase Two of the MCU, which will reach its conclusion in the summer of 2015 with the already highly anticipated Marvel&#8217;s The Avengers: Age of Ulton.  Until then, we are left with the television drama, Marvel&#8217;s Agents of S.H.I.E.D., along with several more solo adventures including Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Guardians of the Galaxy, and the next chapter of Phase Two, Thor: The Dark World.Alan Taylor (HBO&#8217;s Game of Thrones & The Sopranos) directs the comic book sequel, Thor: The Dark World, starring Chris Hemsworth as Thor, the God of Thunder.  In the aftermath of the Battle of New York, Thor has embarked on a mission to bring peace to the nine realms.  With his brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston), safely in custody and peace on the horizon, Thor yearns to see Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) &#8211; despite his father, Odin (Anthony Hopkins), advising against it.  At the same time, a thought-to-be extinct race, called the Dark Elves, hatch a plan to attack Asgard and enact their revenge for the supposed annihilation of their race.  Stellan Skarsgrd, Idris Elba, Kat Dennings, Jaimie Alexander, and Rene Russo also star in supporting roles.About the only drawback of this Thor sequel is that it parallel&#8217;s the first film far too much for comfort.  Both films begin with Thor at a crossroads in his life.  In the first film, he was all about ego, and now, he&#8217;s all about Jane Foster.  Thor&#8217;s father, Odin, is still reluctant to put his son on the throne, causing a great deal of tension before the two.  Loki&#8217;s character is also more of the same, mirroring his actions in both Thor and The Avengers.  To be honest, he&#8217;s mostly still a nuisance &#8211; causing more problems than he&#8217;s worth.  In a mostly humorous turn of events for Loki, it turns out that treason against the Asgardians is grounds for death (which will be discussed as the film goes along), yet launching a major alien invasion against Earth garners nothing more than lifetime imprisonment.  Sure, that&#8217;s awfully convenient, but it&#8217;s a welcomed ruling, especially since Tom Hiddleston has established himself as a nearly indispensable marketing commodity in the MCU.The acting quality of this cast is, like the first film, top-notch.  Chris Hemsworth leads the way as the main protagonist, proving that he is worthy of his initial casting as the God of Thunder.  Like Robert Downey Jr. in the role of Tony Stark/Iron Man, it&#8217;s nearly impossible to imagine any other actor as Thor.  Hemsworth is certainly attractive enough, not to mention ripped as all get out, making him both perfect for this role physically and mentally.  His co-star, Natalie Portman, returns as his love interest, Jane Foster.  And, regardless of what the synopsis above states, Jane Foster is the pivotal character in this story &#8211; so much so that she nearly overshadows Thor.  Portman is one of the few Hollywood&#8217;s A-list actresses that will shine no matter what the role may be, and it will quickly become apparent in this film that she would have been far more suited to play a pivotal character, like Ms. Marvel or the Invisible Woman, instead of a limited supporting character like Jane Foster.As far as the supporting cast goes, there aren&#8217;t enough adjectives in the dictionary to complement their brilliance.  Tom Hiddleston has established himself superbly as the villainous, untrustworthy God of Mischief, Loki.  At this point, he&#8217;s clearly benefited from his flawless portrayal of this character (in his third stint) since the writers have obviously gone out of their way to keep incorporating his character in multiple storylines. Once again returning alongside Hiddleston is Sir Anthony Hopkins.  Honestly, what more could anyone possibly say about the powerful Sir Anthony that hasn&#8217;t already been said?  The same goes for his onscreen wife, Rene Russo, who is the focal point of the film&#8217;s most powerful scene in her role as Thor&#8217;s mother and the Queen of Asgard, Frigga.  Rounding out the noteworthy supporting cast is CBS&#8217; new comedy star, Kat Dennings, who along with Stellan Skarsgrd, provides the film&#8217;s most humorous moments.  And, last but not least is Jaimie Alexander &#8211; returning to her role as Thor&#8217;s other potential love interest, Sir.  Keep an eye of Alexander, folks.  She has the potential to be Hollywood&#8217;s next big thing.Sadly, the main villain of this sequel is no better than the villain of the first film &#8211; and obviously you can&#8217;t have Loki doing the major dirty work in every film.  This is also one more characteristic that mirrors the plot of the first film.  Christopher Eccleston portrays Malekith, another one-dimensional bad guy from Thor&#8217;s weak rogues&#8217; gallery.  Like Colm Feore&#8217;s portrayal as Laufey in the first film, both Malekith and Laufey are vengeful, depth-lacking characters that never, at any point, truly pose a substantial risk &#8211; even in spite of this film&#8217;s tragedy.  Tragedy has become a regular occurrence, with the death of Bucky Barnes in Captain America: The First Avenger (and there&#8217;s no need to spoil his future endeavors) and Agent Coulson in Marvel&#8217;s The Avengers.  Regardless, Malekith is such a poorly established, insignificant villain that finding a real test for Thor in future sequels will be one of the few areas that needs to be addressed.Overall, Thor: The Dark Ones is a welcomed addition to the MCU, even with its noticeable flaws and resemblance to the first film.  The action and super hero drama is endless, not to mention quite epic. Like the majority of comic book films, there&#8217;s a little something for everyone in this film &#8211; including romance.  Don&#8217;t misunderstand &#8211; this is one of the most enjoyable and entertaining films of the year.  However, if there is one significant drawback to this film, it&#8217;s the fact that there&#8217;s nothing monumental that occurs to change the landscape of the MCU.  This sequel is by no means a game changer, but it does set up the next chapter of Phase Two, Guardians of the Galaxy.  With that being said &#8211; don&#8217;t you dare leave your seat until all those credits have passed.  You&#8217;ll be kicking yourself if you do.  Enjoy.GRADE:  B-FNDNreview.comP.S. &#8211; keep your eyes open for a cameo from both Stan Lee and a &#8220;glimpse&#8221; of one of Thor&#8217;s fellow Avengers.",4,'Thor: The Dark World' a welcome

However, he did sense their invisible ship as it approached Asgard.  Asgard comes under attack, after Jane seeks refuge having discovered the ether.Jane discovers the ether, in an attempt to find Thor.  The ether is a power capable of destroying all nine worlds at the point of convergence.  The convergence occurs when all nine kingdoms converge.The movie has a great villain and immersive air fight scenes.  You feel like your in the movie.  The camera pans in on the enemy craft as it breaches Asgards security systems.Supposedly  Odins father destroyed all the Elves.  It seems Odin views of Asgards glory are exaggerated.  Odin would have fallen to the Elves, if Thor had not sacrificed himself.  His acts of defiance were considered treasonous to Odin.  Why couldn't Odin see through his King Lear complex?The death of the queen was sad and dramatic.  She died protecting Jane.  A sign of approval and love.Ecceleston could have been one of the smartest and most whitty doctor.  In this movie, he plays the villain with great skill.  The Malekith villain swats the Thor hammer away like a fly.  The villain is tough, cold hearted, parasitic, and cruel.  Malekith plot is too use the ether to convert all matter to dark matter.  He reminds me of the Doctor Who villain called the ""Dark Guardian""The universe is supersymmetrical where matter slightly exceeds anti-matter.  Entropy or chaos would occur in great amounts if the symmetry were broken.  The Elf King hopes to use the ether to destroy the nine realms.  Like the Dark Guardian entropy would nullify the universe.  Both are super villains.London is the point of convergence and Malekith brings his ship and the ether to the city.  All the Kingdoms coming to alignment affecting the mass and gravity of each kingdom.Loki is the trickster.  You can't read his alliance, his feelings toward his parents, or his love of his brother.  He is slipper on all accounts.  Thor manipulates Loki into helping to get the ether out of Jane.  He tricks everyone to believe he has been destroyed by the dark matter miniature black hole.Jane demonstrates brains over brawn and saves Thor.  She controls the space portal holes.Thor departs Odin giving up the throne because he does not like the brutality of rule.  The Father can not acknowledge that Thor saved the Kingdom.The ether was predicted by Einstein.  The ether has been proven to exist in the power outputs of Low Energy Nuclear reaction that harness the near infinite amounts of energy.  LENR is both disruptive and feared by the orthodoxy. The neural linguist aspects of the movie are designed to imprint in peoples minds that the ether is evil.  Einstein described the dark matter anti-gravity affects as the reason for the accelerating expanding spherical universe.

1566424,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B008JFUS0U,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[3, 7]","- Loki (facing judgment from Odin the Allfather re his war crimes): ""I really don't see what the fuss is about.""The heart of this film beats neither to the great romance between the Earth woman and the Odinson nor to a dark elf's vengeance that has seethed the span of the life of the universe. See THOR: THE DARK WORLD for the otherworldly grandeur and the larger-than-life characters and heroes fighting off an extinction-level threat and for the occasional drops of humor. But it'll impress on you soon enough that what anchors the narrative is the robust, complex, love-hate interplay between Thor and his step-brother Loki.You've probably learned your lesson from when you ducked out early the last time, but do stay for the two post-credit stingers.Maybe you should know that, every five thousand years, there is the Convergence, an event of mere minutes in which the Nine Realms are perfectly aligned. Maybe you react to that cosmic reveal in zen-like manner; you could be like that Buddhist who went up to the hot dog vendor and said, ""Make me one with everything."" Or you could react like Malekith, him what bears an almighty grudge against the universe and so seeks its undoing. Good cess to you and me and the Buddhist with the hot dog, the dread dark elf was stymied millennia ago, his ancient weapon of choice, the Aether, destroyed. Or so it was thought the Aether was destroyed.Ain't it just like a dude? For two years Jane Foster has abided, waiting for her Asgardian to return like he said he would. Blame the trickster god, Loki, for Thor's big delay. Loki's misdeeds - specifically, those concerning the destruction of the Bifrost Bridge - have bred chaos in the Nine Realms. When not in New York smiting invading not-Skrulls, Thor's been preoccupied with restoring order across the Nine Realms. Still, Odin the Allfather has noted his son's confused heart. Odin tries to steer Thor's attention towards the beautiful and fierce Lady Sif. I'm down with that. I'm on Team Sif. We the movie-going audience could've used more of her and more of the Warriors Three. And maybe less of that pantsless astrophysicist (no, it's not Jane).By the way, it's nice to see ""Chuck Bartowski"" get himself another gig.Jane Porter, astrophysicist (with pants on), plays a critical role. She's in fact at the very core of the plot, which I guess is a fortuitous thing because, else, why have Thor come to Earth at all? I'll just say that, as the story opens, she's still in deep mopes about her missing thunder god when she hears word of a ""stable gravitational anomaly"" in London. Off she goes to investigate, catalyst to the plot and this time laden with more spunk.For those wishing that Thor would explore more of the Nine Realms and more of his relationship with his fellow Asgardians (including Loki), done and done (and done). Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston have done wonders to promote sibling rivalry. I feel like starting a feud with my brother myself, that dirtbag. Hiddleston is again remarkable. His performance full of layers. From having viewed the trailers, it's understood that there's a big bad out there bigger and badder than Loki. But don't dismiss this god of mischief, don't sell short his craving to rule and his towering rage and just how plain sneaky he is. He's the best kind of villain, compelling, intelligent, someone you can't help but like and maybe even root for. That charismatic deceiver.For the comic book reader there's a grip of gratification. I swear that giant rock monster that Thor faces in fleeting single combat is of the same alien species he tangled with in his debut in JOURNEY INTO MYSTERY #83 (1962). Malekith, of course, is an old foe, as is Kurse. Somewhere, Walt Simonson has got to have this wee smile. Maybe he's waiting for the Frog of Thunder arc to be adapted to cinema.Is it better than the first film? I dunno. Certainly the mythology is richer. I think THOR: THE DARK WORLD is worth paying to see (even the 3D doesn't suck), never mind that the narrative beats won't club you over the head with the originality stick and that the Asgardian dialogue comes off like Shakespeare in his cups. Never mind that Eccleston's Malekith inspires jaded shrugs more than invested hisses. And that we're once more subjected to that familiar ego stroke wherein humanity - or, in this case, Earth - turns out to be the focal point of the universe. Nngh. Well, what matters is that it's a visually arresting movie. The CG and the practical set pieces wonderfully evoke the glorious spectacle of Asgard and the ashen desolation of the dark elves' world of Svartalfheim. When I Mapquested the route from my house to Svartalfheim, the thing said the distance was two trillion miles. I don't have that kind of gas. Anyway, the movie does well in rounding out certain corners in the Thor universe. It's got this terrific fish-out-of-water element, only it's not Thor this time who's out of his element. It's a cast that represents. Hemsworth is comfy and commanding in the thunder god's burly skin. And while Natalie Portman improves on her performance from the first film - because she's given more to do here - I still think Thor is dumb as hammers for ignoring Sif. I just couldn't take my eyes off Jaimie Alexander. Rene Russo doesn't have a lot of camera time, but she shines when onscreen and demonstrates that Frigga, the gentle Asgardian Queen, can flip instantly into a complete badass warrior woman. In that one fighty fight she was in, I kept expecting to see Riggs and Murtaugh in the background cheering her on.And, if nothing else, I pull for these Thor movies because of my little niece's adorable interpretation of the name of Thor's mystical hammer, Mj&ouml;lnir. She calls it ""Meow Meow.""

1566449,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B008JFUS0U,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[5, 9]","When Marvel Comics was ramping up its &#34;Phase One&#34; of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it seemed like the hardest character to get to connect with an audience was a Norse demigod. You had a genius billionaire playboy philanthropist who wore a metal suit and fought bad guys; you had a meek scientist that could turn into the strongest being on the planet; you had a brave and good-hearted weakling that was turned into a super-soldier to fight the ultimate earthly evil. But a dreamy god of Norse legend that threw a big hammer around? How could they make that work? Thanks to some star-making performances by Chris Hemsworth as the titular god of thunder and Tom Hiddleston as the seductive and duplicitous god of mischief, and quality supporting performances by the likes of Natalie Portman, Stellan Skarsgard, Kat Dennings, and Anthony Hopkins, as well as solid direction by Kenneth Branagh, we had a really good time with the first THOR. And after the events of THE AVENGERS, where Thor and Loki played a large part in, we felt even better about these charcters. Now, it's time for &#34;Phase Two&#34;, and a new ancient evil threatens all of existence and it's time for Thor to pick up Mjolnir again and for the Asgardians to take up arms and defend all the nine realms in THOR: THE DARK WORLD.The Nine Realms are reaching an era of peace that Thor and his compatriots of the Lady Sif (Jaimie Alexander, reprising), and the Warriors Three (Volstagg, reprised by Ray Stevenson; Hogun, reprised by Tadanobu Asano, and Fandral. played by Zachary Levi replacing Joshua Dallas) look to stop the forces that threaten the peace on the separate realms, and Loki rots in a cell, with only his mother Frigga (Rene Russo, reprising) as a visitor. Meanwhile, back on Earth, Jane Foster (Portman, reprising), Darcy (Dennings, reprising) and Erik Selvig (Skarsgard, reprising) are investigating a very strange anomaly in London. This anomaly ties to a long-lost power once wielded by Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) and the Dark Elves of Svarltleheim want to use to remake the universe into nothingness again (as it once was, as explained in a spectacular prelude by Odin, again reprised by Hopkins). This power infects Jane, the love of Thor's life and he appears once again on Earth to whisk her away to Asgard. She meets his family and friends, but is soon falling victim to the infection of the power coursing through her. And Malekith, drawn to this power, attacks Asgard and causes a tragic death that spurs Thor to take the fight to Malekith and the remainder of the Dark Elves. But on order to get there, they must first free Loki, who has reasons of his own to stop Malekith. So Thor and Loki and Jane escape Asgard as fugitives to the barren wasteland of Svartleheim, and the fight continues on Earth as Thor and Malekith face off for the fate of the universe.Firstly, the film is much more visually stunning than the first one. Alan Taylor (a director of many great TV shows such as ROME, DEADWOOD, and THE SOPRANOS, but perhaps most famous for his work on GAME OF THRONES) replaces Branagh as the director here, and has the benefit of a much more remarkable visual palette to work with, with much of the film taking place in Asgard, but every place they go just looks more detailed than what was previously seen in the original. Secondly, the film has a much more distinct comic book feel to it thanks to screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (this is the second of three Marvel films they've written together; firstly with CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE FIRST AVENGER, then this, and soon the upcoming CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE WINTER SOLDIER) as well as Christopher Yost, a great comic writer in his own right as well as the creative force behind the greatest of the Marvel cartoons, such as AVENGERS: EARTH'S MIGHTIEST HEROES and WOLVERINE AND THE X-MEN. So there's a lot of behind-the-scenes talent at work. In front of the screen, there is, as with most sequels, more of an opportunity to expand character and not focus so much on exposition. You really get the feeling that with three films under his belt as the same character that Hemsworth is absolutely 100% comfortable as Thor. He exudes the strength, courage, sacrifice, charm and hard-headedness that the character is most known for. The other Asgardians get some more time as well, with more exposure for Sif and the Warriors Three and especially for the all-seeing guardian Heimdall (reprised by Idris Elba, whose work in films like PACIFIC RIM and shows like LUTHER seem to require he gets more screentime). Sadly, this is where the film makes some mistakes, though. Only the wonderfully funny Dennings gets more to do in this film from a character standpoint. Portman seems to be almost woefully underused here. She seems to be either a damsel-in-distress or a device for advancing the plot of those around her. The great Christopher Eccleston has almost nothing to do here except for appear in freaky makeup and look and sound menacing. At least the villain of the first film was given something to do, and it would have greatly benefitted the film if Malekith were allowed to speechify a bit to give his character a little more gravity.However, if this villain is a little on the weak side, it's only because this film's other &#34;villain&#34; is so incredibly strong, and of course, I'm talking about the genius of Tom Hiddleston as Loki. He walks away with this film, as he did from a performance standpoint in THE AVENGERS. The first film spent a good deal of time with Hemsworth and Hiddleston evenly balanced, and while Thor has more screentime, once Loki is on screen, all eyes must divert to him. Hiddleston's performance is so magnetic, so sleekly charming and so smartly crafted that he's created one of the great screen characters, let alone screen villains, in recent years. The scene where he and Thor are walking together as Loki keeps changing forms (and creates a BRILLIANT cameo) is easily the best scene in the film.The thing that I felt most about this film after it was over, aside from how interesting and exciting and epic the film felt was that there is a longer version of this film somewhere. The film clocks in at an exceedingly brisk 112 minutes (and that's including TWO post-credits sequences), and I think there's more there that maybe was cut for budgetary constraints, because I can't think of this film cropping anything for time when it's that short.All in all, THOR: THE DARK WORLD is by far the better of the two &#34;Phase Two&#34; films that Marvel released this year thanks to a stronger story, stronger performances, and a greater dedication to the comic book ideals that make these great characters who they are.",4,"I SAY THEE, ""YAY!!""",1385251200,"11 24,

Thor searches for a way to save Jane, while wanting vengeance on Malekith. Vengeance brings Loki and Thor together as well, for reasons I won't get into.Thor 2 is unfortunately an uneven action comedy. That's right, I said comedy. Throughout the film it takes itself serious one minute and throws humor at us the next. It's as if they think every Marvel film now should balance humor and action, Avengers style. Which sadly made the movie pretty goofy. And reminded me of a disappointing film...like Episode 1, since I sat for awhile kind of bored waiting for it to become what I was hoping for.We have seen super villains who just want to blow *beep* up in the past. So yeah, Malekith is nothing fresh. And looks like a combination of something from Lord of the Rings and Star Trek Nemesis. Plus, we've seen enough cities destroyed in Transformers, the Avengers and Man of Steel to not be too impressed any more by cgi carnage.I also have to add the Thor and Jane Foster romance has always felt forced to me. All their scenes together add up to nothing in the end. Thor and Loki together again is what's fun. Kat Dennings (2 Broke Girls) is the most interesting woman in the film as Foster's intern, now with her...own intern. She reacts better to all the craziness around her then probably anyone else in the movie. Even a woman in a subway acts like it's normal when Thor walks in. Stellan Skarsgard is also fun reprising his genius scientist role but this time he has gone mad due to Loki's mind control.I liked enough of the movie to recommend it but I think Kenneth Branagh made the Thor universe much more interesting. With this director it kind of just trudged along, jumping from one scene to another. Iron Man 3 and Thor 2 are unfortunately just an ""Eh"" start to Marvel phase 2.

Plenty of action, good humor and some great visual effects combine for a quality ride through our world, Thor's world and the Dark World. Actors provide adequate, if not above average performances, and Loki's character is certainly one to watch for. I particularly enjoyed Loki's role in that one can simply call him out as a conniving brother ... but,  then again, you can almost come to like him.Almost... by no stretch is he Mr.  Niceguy - like Captain America -however, he does show hints of some redeeming qualities in this latest Thor flick.The final action sequences are very entertaining ... with portals between worlds appearing at the most convenient places and times ... however some of the best surprises come at the very end and during the credits.Overall, this movie is a solid 4 stars ... almost 4.5.Along with being an entertaining flick, one can draw many comparisons between this movie, ""Star Trek Into the Darkness"" and ""Star Wars"" movies.1. The battle depicted in Thor's opening scenes can draw comparisons to a Star Wars battle scene.2. Loki and Kahn share similar holding cells. Both are reluctantly released to help fight a common enemy.3. Both Loki and Kahn show hints of redeeming qualities,  but return to their evil roots by the movie's end.4. Natalie Portmman's characters in Thor and Star Wars are both brought to a palace for protection during a battle. Furthermore,  one is protected by use of a hologram, the other uses a physical double.5. The final battle scenes have an enemy spacecraft landing or crashing into a large city on Earth with the enemy emerging from the ship to do the final fight.6. A heroine or love interest helps to save the good guy in the end (Thor and Star Trek).Many more comparisons can be made between the three films.

1566494,AXOO7BPM22BDO,B008JFUS0U,"John Green ""Darkwriter""","[9, 18]","After all the hyperbole the sequel to Thor arrives in theaters today, making the only remaining question surrounding it was it worth the wait?Yep.**SPOILER ALERT**Loosely following Walt Simonson's epic Thor story arc from the eighties when he took over the comic, this movie follows Malekith, leader of the ""Dark Elves"" of Svartalfheim in his odyssey to destroy the universe of light- the Nine Worlds- using a doomsday weapon he created called Aether- a nebulous form of energy he's able to harness.  Malekith attempts to unleash the Aether during the Convergence: a cosmic event where all the realms line up in a syzygy conjunction- all in a row- joining them together.  Defeated by Bor, Odin's father, Malekith retreats with his core forces and goes into suspended animation.  Unable to destroy the Aether, Bor orders it buried somewhere far beyond anyone's reach.  Until now...Meanwhile, Thor is still cleaning up the mess Loki made of things.  The Nine Worlds are battling vestiges of chaos, wars raging across them all.  Things finally get under control just as a new convergence is beginning; the walls between the dimensions become unstable, causing spatial rifts on Earth.  Jane Foster and her friend Darcy, discover one such portal, which draws Jane in to where she discovers where the Aether is hidden and is contaminated by it, which awakens Malekith.  Thor brings Jane to Asgard to try to help her, rekindling their romance.  The Dark Elves' science allows them to hide from even Heimdall's gaze, and they strike at Asgard looking for Jane.  Loki, ever unrepentant, is languishing in the dungeon when Malekith attacks, and even aids the cause a little, which he soon comes to regret.  Now facing complete annihilation, Thor and his allies form a desperate plan to confront Malekith and destroy the Aether- and they'll need Loki's help to do it.**END SPOILERS**This movie was a lot of fun, and in almost every way superior to the first.  The story's tone was darker and much more serious; even though it relied a lot on sci-fi tropes it worked well.  The Dark Elves are more along the lines of super-science than a science/sorcery blend- they're basically a bunch of conquering aliens that for a second or two you'd almost think were Klingons or something from their technology designs.In our age of 3D filming, there's lots of stuff getting tossed around, large objects being destroyed and things flying all over the place just for the heck of it sometimes, but it doesn't distract too much. In fact, the action is pretty good; there's some excellent fight scenes and nearly every character gets some action in- even Frigga gets to mix it up a little, much to everyone's delight!The character development is also stellar.  Nearly everyone gets time to shine, especially Loki (natch), and some of his scenes are the best in the flick- the ones when he receives some rather bad news and when he's accompanying Thor on their quest are standouts.  There's a moment of tragedy which binds he and Thor together and helps to secure Loki's aid against the Dark Elves, and it's a tough one but it serves the story well.  Some of the dialogue is pretty cheesy at times, but that's ok.  The humor is also good; not overwhelming things but just enough in the right places to keep things flowing.  And there's a few references to the Marvel Universe, which made for some excellent touches.Thor: The Dark World is in lots of ways the movie the first one should've been.  It builds upon the franchise's mythology, and takes a couple of turns you won't really expect.  And it's all to the good.

1566501,A2R1YK3THA0RB3,B008JFUS0U,Josh,"[5, 6]","Although I was heavily critical last year about the high grossing, yet controversial movie Iron Man 3, I was keeping tidbits and a close eye on reports about Thor the Dark World. And I chose to do the review at an almost convenient time; if 24 days before its dvd/blu-ray release date is what you call convenient. So here are my thoughts on Thor the Dark World.After the almost cataclysmic events of The Avengers, Loki is punished for his crimes he has committed while on Earth. And as for our main hero Thor, is meanwhile informed that the 9 realms are to be aligned. Soon, his love interest Jane Foster is sucked into another world and later infected therefore given a resurection to our main antagonist Malekith(Christopher Eccleston). A war soon begins and upon realizing the fight is too great even for him, Thor enlists Loki's assistance in defeating Malekith, and so our movie begins.Thor continues to surprise me. Chris Hemsworth was great once again as the titular hero in this movie. Tom Hiddleston didn't necessarily steal the show, but he once again delivered wonders, and humor as Loki. Also returning are Natalie Portman as Jane, Kat Dennings as Darcy, Stellan Skarsgard as Erik Selvig, Idris Elba as Heimdall, and Jaimie Alexander as Sif.All in all, as Phase 2 began with Iron Man 3, Thor the Dark World is an enjoyable and highly likable sequel thanks to the acting, visuals, and the story line that started the movie off on the right track, and ends with a surprise cliffhanger. Not only is this a good movie, but Thor the Dark World is a sequel that refines everything good about the 2011 film.9.1/10Rated PG-13Supporting Cast: Anthony Hopkins, Christopher Eccelston, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Ray Stevenson, Rene Russo, Chris Evans,Captain America: The Winter Soldier:April 4, 2014Guardians of the Galaxy:August 1, 2014Avengers Age of Ultron: May 1, 2015",5,One of Marvel Studios's Better sequels,1391212800,"02 1, 2014",2014,1873,"['was', 'heavily', 'critical', 'last', 'year', 'high', 'grossing', 'yet', 'controversial', 'movie', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'was', 'keeping', 'tidbits', 'close', 'eye', 'reports', 'Thor', 'Dark', 'World', 'chose', 'do', 'review', 'almost', 'convenient', 'time', '24', 'days', 'dvd/blu-ray', 'release', 'date', 'what', 'call', 'convenient', 'So', 'here', 'are', 'thoughts', 'Thor', 'Dark', 'World.After', 'almost', 'cataclysmic', 'events', 'Avengers', 'Loki', 'punished', 'crimes', 'committed', 'Earth', 'main', 'hero', 'Thor', 'meanwhile', 'informed', '9', 'realms', 'are', 'be', 'aligned', 'Soon', 'love', 'interest', 'Jane', 'Foster', 'sucked', 'world', 'later', 'infected', 'therefore', 'given', 'resurection', 'main', 'antagonist', 'Malekith', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'A', 'war', 'soon', 'begins', 'realizing', 'fight', 'too', 'great', 'even', 'Thor', 'Loki', 'assistance', 'defeating', 'Malekith', 'so', 'movie', 'begins.Thor', 'surprise', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'was', 'great', 'once', 'again', 'titular', 'hero', 'movie', 'Tom', 'Hiddleston', 'did', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'steal', 'show', 'once', 'again', 'delivered', 'wonders', 'humor', 'Loki', 'Also', 'returning', 'are', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'Jane', 'Kat', 'Dennings', 'Darcy', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgard', 'Erik', 'Selvig', 'Idris', 'Elba', 'Heimdall', 'Jaimie', 'Alexander', 'Sif.All', 'Phase', '2', 'began', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'Thor', 'Dark', 'World', 'enjoyable', 'highly', 'likable', 'sequel', 'thanks', 'acting', 'visuals', 'story', 'line', 'started', 'movie', 'right', 'track', 'surprise', 'cliffhanger', 'Not', 'only', 'good', 'movie', 'Thor', 'Dark', 'World', 'sequel', 'everything', 'good', '2011', 'film.9.1/10Rated', 'PG-13Supporting', 'Cast', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Christopher', 'Eccelston', 'Adewale', 'Akinnuoye-Agbaje', 'Ray', 'Stevenson', 'Rene', 'Russo', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'Captain', 'America', 'Winter', 'Soldier', 'April', '4', '2014Guardians', 'Galaxy', 'August', '1', '2014Avengers', 'Age', 'Ultron', 'May', '1', '2015']",N/A

Hawking and let the rest of us just enjoy a rip-roaring fun movie. The reviews that called to task the science in &#34;Thor: The Dark World&#34; just make me laugh. After all, this is a Marvel Universe movie, one in which a gamma irradiated scientist turns into a green monster when he's mad and in which a super soldier can sleep in ice for decades and wake up to rock spandex and a shield. Who cares if Jane and Erik Selvig spout nonsense? I mean, come on, can you honestly say you know what would happen if a bunch of dark elves decide to return the universe to darkness? No? Right, so let's move on shall we. &#34;Thor: The Dark World&#34; kicks cinematic butt, picking up where &#34;The Avengers&#34; left off with Thor putting out fires across the 9 Realms and Loki being kicked to the curb...er, dungeon...for trying to subjugate us poor Midgardians. When Jane Foster -- who is understandably bummed because her man didn't call even when he was in New York (really, Thor, you couldn't have checked in after the schwarma date with the other Avengers?) -- stumbles on this cool looking red stuff that The Big Bad Dark Elf Malekith wants, it sets in motion the events that lead to Thor forming a complicated alliance with Loki. That alliance is at the heart of the movie and provides the most riveting scenes. Good friends in real life, Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston know Thor and Loki respectively, inside and out, and give them depth and texture that in many ways make the Marvel Thor series the richest in terms of characterization. In particular, Hiddleston's Loki is psychologically complex and sympathetic while never losing his essential mischievousness. Loki is one of the most compelling villains in modern cinema thanks to Hiddleston. In &#34;Thor: TDW,&#34; Stellan Skarsgard and Kat Dennings also shine, providing much of the comedy. Other high points of the movie are the look of Asgard and the rousing original score by Brian Tyler. There's a lot to love in this movie.

I'm at a disadvantage by 1) Not reading the comic books 2) Not seeing Avengers, and 3) not seeing the first Thor movie! (At least I saw all 3 Iron Men).  I'd think the biggest fans would be teens, but there's enough here to keep a parent interested as well--especially a FEMALE parent.  I just think it's WRONG that Hemsworth should be more drool-worthy than Portman.  Maybe because he gets to show more skin?With a movie like this you EXPECT great visuals.  You do GET great visuals.  I especially liked the bifrost bridge.  I'm not sure how I would have depicted it, but it looked great.  Yes, the funeral scene also was beautiful--and the off-world scenes were suitably awesome, and/or ominous.What made this film unexpectedly relevant was a piece of news just a couple weeks ago that at an annual festival in England celebrating Norse mythology, the festival head insisted with a straight face that the world is about to face &#34;Ragnarok&#34;--the Twilight of the Gods.  In Nordic mythology the world doesn't end with a whimper but a bang--a colossal war among the gods which will destroy all of humanity except one man and one woman who, like Adam and Eve, will be left to re-populate the world.  A Nordic tradition apparently states that when 3 winters occur without any intervening summer, it's a sure sign that Ragnarok is next.  Reportedly the last 2 summers were unusually cool and wet in the Nordic countries, leading this devotee to insist that Ragnarok comes this year...In this movie it seems as if Thor manages to prevent something like Ragnarok.  Once every 5,000 years (?) all 9 realms which circle Yggdrasil come into alignment, and...well uh...there are dark elves in spaceships and they want to take the whole cosmos back to utter darkness...WHY?  Who knows?  Would they still have a world in that case?  I assume they see GREAT in utter darkness?Whatever..these 9 realms don't correlate with the nine planets of our solar system (if we add Pluto back in) so they must exist, like heaven and hell, in some normally invisible realms.  Leading me back to...Portman has TOO MUCH visible clothes, Hemsworth JUST ABOUT RIGHT, and Stellan/Erik Selvig, WAY NOT ENOUGH!Obviously I think TOO MUCH for this kind of movie.

1566529,A2DCS39GFBJV24,B008JFUS0U,Kenya Starflight,"[0, 0]","As something of a budding ""Avengers"" fan, I've greatly enjoyed watching the films, both the collective ""Avengers"" film and the films starring singular members of the team.  So far, my verdict is that the first films starring these characters are probably the strongest -- ""Thor,"" ""Captain America: The First Avenger,"" and the first ""Iron Man"" were good solid films in their own rights and could easily stand on their own merits.  These films laid down the basic origin story of each hero, enabling a newcomer to understand the story without having to slog through forty years of comics beforehand, but they could still appeal to longtime fans as well.  The second and third ""Iron Man"" movies were weaker in comparison to the first, in my opinion, but given how much I enjoyed ""Thor"" I expected to enjoy the second film as much as the first.Unfortunately, ""Thor: The Dark World"" falls into the same territory as ""Iron Man 2"" -- it's weaker and less enjoyable than its predecessor.  But it's still a fun film to watch, and has some enjoyable moments.""Thor: The Dark World"" picks up three years after the events of the first film, with Thor taking his duties of protecting the Nine Realms seriously and his human love interest, Jane Foster, continuing her scientific studies.  While investigating what appears to be a wormhole in London, Jane gets sucked in briefly and is merged with a superweapon called the Aether, which has the power to bring eternal darkness to the universe.  This makes her a target for both the Asgardians, who want the weapon out of the wrong hands, and the Dark Elves, led by Malekith, who want to use the Aether to bring darkness to all the realms.  Thor wants to protect Jane as well as defend the realms, but in order to protect all he holds dear he may have to make a deal with the devil... his brother, Loki, still imprisoned for the events of ""Avengers"" and desperate to break free and gain vengeance and power.Naturally, this isn't a movie that sparks a lot of cerebral discussion, and even though it uses elements of Norse mythology, trying to compare it to the actual Norse folklore will only irritate you.  It's very fun to look at, though, with creative and well-made visuals and some eye-popping special effects.  The dark elves' spacecraft are especially well-done, especially with their cloaking tech.  The elves' designs themselves aren't particularly memorable, and they look and act more like the orcs from ""Lord of the Rings"" than anything elven.The scenes with the Asgardians, strangely enough, are the weakest in the film.  Their dialogue is probably meant to sound noble and grand, but comes across as stilted and awkward.  It doesn't help that everyone plays their lines out as if they were bored.  Chris Hemsworth was at his best in the original film and in ""Avengers"" when he was gloriously hammy and over-the-top, but here he's simply boring.  And Odin's sudden disdain for humans comes across as rather jarring, especially since he cast Thor out of Asgard in the first film precisely for his disdain for lesser beings.  A small continuity hiccup, but an annoying one.The film is at its best when it's focusing on the human characters (especially Erik or Darcy) or on Loki.  Tom Hiddleston is far and away one of the best villains to come out of a Marvel movie -- he plays his scenes with such delightful slickness, and is capable of being gloriously over-the-top or coolly understated as the plot requires, and even manages to inject some actual pathos into his role.  Loki is a villain you either love or love to hate, and in contrast Malekith, the primary villain of this film, comes across as largely forgettable.  This could be a problem in future films, as Marvel can't rely on Loki to provide the primary conflict of EVERY Avengers movie.Not as good as its predecessor, this is still a fun movie, with plenty of action, humor, and even a bit of romance that doesn't overtake the film.  Naturally it ends on a giant sequel hook, and there are a few ""stingers"" buried in the credits that hint at future adventures... and perils...",4,"Not as good as the first, but still a fun action flick",1395100800,"03 18, 2014",2014,4083,"['something', 'budding', 'Avengers', 'fan', ""'ve"", 'greatly', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'films', 'collective', 'Avengers', 'film', 'films', 'starring', 'singular', 'members', 'team', 'So', 'far', 'verdict', 'first', 'films', 'starring', 'characters', 'are', 'probably', 'strongest', 'Thor', 'Captain', 'America', 'First', 'Avenger', 'first', 'Iron', 'Man', 'were', 'good', 'solid', 'films', 'own', 'rights', 'could', 'easily', 'stand', 'own', 'merits', 'films', 'laid', 'basic', 'origin', 'story', 'hero', 'enabling', 'newcomer', 'understand', 'story', 'having', 'slog', 'forty', 'years', 'comics', 'beforehand', 'could', 'still', 'appeal', 'longtime', 'fans', 'well', 'second', 'third', 'Iron', 'Man', 'movies', 'were', 'weaker', 'comparison', 'first', 'opinion', 'given', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'Thor', 'expected', 'enjoy', 'second', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'first.Unfortunately', 'Thor', 'Dark', 'World', 'same', 'territory', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'weaker', 'less', 'enjoyable', 'predecessor', 'still', 'fun', 'film', 'watch', 'enjoyable', 'moments', 'Thor', 'Dark', 'World', 'up', 'three', 'years', 'events', 'first', 'film', 'Thor', 'taking', 'duties', 'protecting', 'Nine', 'Realms', 'seriously', 'human', 'love', 'interest', 'Jane', 'Foster', 'continuing', 'scientific', 'studies', 'investigating', 'what', 'be', 'wormhole', 'London', 'Jane', 'sucked', 'briefly', 'merged', 'superweapon', 'called', 'Aether', 'power', 'bring', 'eternal', 'darkness', 'universe', 'target', 'Asgardians', 'who', 'want', 'weapon', 'wrong', 'hands', 'Dark', 'Elves', 'led', 'Malekith', 'who', 'want', 'use', 'Aether', 'bring', 'darkness', 'realms', 'Thor', 'protect', 'Jane', 'as', 'well', 'defend', 'realms', 'order', 'protect', 'may', 'have', 'make', 'deal', 'devil', 'brother', 'Loki', 'still', 'imprisoned', 'events', 'Avengers', 'desperate', 'break', 'free', 'gain', 'vengeance', 'power.Naturally', ""n't"", 'movie', 'lot', 'cerebral', 'discussion', 'even', 'elements', 'Norse', 'mythology', 'trying', 'compare', 'actual', 'Norse', 'folklore', 'will', 'only', 'irritate', 'very', 'fun', 'look', 'creative', 'well-made', 'visuals', 'eye-popping', 'special', 'effects', 'dark', 'elves', 'spacecraft', 'are', 'especially', 'well-done', 'especially', 'cloaking', 'tech', 'elves', 'designs', 'are', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'memorable', 'look', 'act', 'more', 'orcs', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'anything', 'elven.The', 'scenes', 'Asgardians', 'strangely', 'enough', 'are', 'weakest', 'film', 'dialogue', 'probably', 'meant', 'sound', 'noble', 'grand', 'across', 'stilted', 'awkward', ""n't"", 'help', 'everyone', 'lines', 'out', 'were', 'bored', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'was', 'best', 'original', 'film', 'Avengers', 'when', 'was', 'gloriously', 'hammy', 'over-the-top', 'here', 'simply', 'boring', 'Odin', 'sudden', 'disdain', 'humans', 'rather', 'jarring', 'especially', 'cast', 'Thor', 'Asgard', 'first', 'film', 'precisely', 'disdain', 'lesser', 'beings', 'small', 'continuity', 'hiccup', 'annoying', 'one.The', 'film', 'best', 'when', 'focusing', 'human', 'characters', 'especially', 'Erik', 'Darcy', 'Loki', 'Tom', 'Hiddleston', 'far', 'away', 'one', 'best', 'villains', 'come', 'Marvel', 'movie', 'scenes', 'such', 'delightful', 'slickness', 'capable', 'being', 'gloriously', 'over-the-top', 'coolly', 'understated', 'plot', 'even', 'manages', 'inject', 'actual', 'pathos', 'role', 'Loki', 'villain', 'love', 'love', 'hate', 'contrast', 'Malekith', 'primary', 'villain', 'film', 'largely', 'forgettable', 'could', 'be', 'problem', 'future', 'films', 'Marvel', 'ca', ""n't"", 'rely', 'Loki', 'provide', 'primary', 'conflict', 'EVERY', 'Avengers', 'as', 'good', 'predecessor', 'still', 'fun', 'movie', 'plenty', 'action', 'humor', 'even', 'bit', 'romance', ""n't"", 'overtake', 'film', 'Naturally', 'giant', 'sequel', 'hook', 'are', 'few', 'stingers', 'buried', 'credits', 'hint', 'future', 'adventures', 'perils']",N/A

Both Thor and his father Odin are faced with a powerful but evil leader named Malekeith bent on inflicting suffering. This leader's taste for violent chaos comes from personal tragedy in his own life.  I enjoyed the love story that played out between the characters of Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Jane Foster (Natalie Portman). This is because both characters seamlessly picked up where they last left off from the first film with their relationship.  Additionally, Thor's character is shown bravely taking Jane Foster to his world despite how his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) may act. Realistically, true emotion was also shown when Thor and his brother Loki are greatly affected by an event that would change many people (involving a family member).  Idris Elba is given an even bigger influential role in the plot of the film as Heimdall.  Heimdall's character portrays a sense of perceptiveness in a scene that involves him foreseeing what can happen on one of the main bridges in Asgard. Just a gentle suggestion: maybe Heimdall could be including with Thor in future films as some type of advisor to both Thor and/or his father Odin regarding protection plans for Asgard and/or other strategic mission ideas. My husband's favorite character portrayals were that of Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and Malekith (Christopher Eccleston). This is because Loki's character is portayed as a strong spirit who wisely knows how to appeal to Thor's heart-centered side while also shrewdly concealing his private and tricky plans. Eccleston's Malekith also appealed to my husband due to the character depth portrayal of what motivated Malekith's actions.

Honestly, I don't expect deep themes and heavy drama from my Super-Hero movies so I'm rarely disappointed. As much as I loved Thor (the original) I love this one MUCH more. The characters have already been introduced to audiences, so in this round they undergo the development that was lacking in the first.Thor is no longer the bombastic, arrogant juvenile that he was in his first film. His first priority is to restore peace to the nine realms, as it should be. He's heir to the throne of Asgard, after all. But he's distracted by thoughts of Jane Foster, the woman he didn't get to see the last time he was on Earth. ;) He checks in on her by asking Heimdal (who can see almost everything in the nine realms) how she's doing.Loki is angry, lonely, sad, an explosive... and that's just while he's in prison. After the events of The Avengers, he's been locked up, isolated from the only person he loves: his mother, Frigga. In desperation, he even conjures an illusion of her simply to have someone to talk to. When Thor finally comes to him for help (another desperate act) all he can promise is his rage and desire for revenge as assurance that he won't betray Thor yet again.We don't get enough of Jane in Thor and The Dark World to see how much she might have grown over the past two-and-a-half years, but she's an honest person, intelligent, and strong-willed. I have no problem believing that Thor would fall for her. I was satisfied with the 'ship in this sequel, wishing for more, but knowing a PG-13 comic-based movie wouldn't be able to deliver. The second tag scene (yes, there are TWO, just like after The Avengers) sated my shipper's desires.I think the most delightful part of the film was Mjolnir, Thor's hammer. You'll have to see the film to understand.Overall, the film is a fun ride with real peril and several laughs.

It's certainly why I keep watching &#34;S.H.I.E.L.D.&#34; despite its mediocre plotlines and acting, and it's what lured me to &#34;Iron Man 3&#34; (even though Iron Man didn't need any help).  So watching &#34;Thor: The Dark World&#34; has become a necessity just to get all the inside jokes from the Marvel marketing juggernaut. Despite the world-shattering implications, not a whole lot happens.&#34;The Dark World&#34; begins with the dark elves, an evil race hell bent on reclaiming the universe with dark matter using a magical weapon of mass destruction called the Aether. These elves are led by Malekith (Christopher Eccleston), and he uses dark matter to create killing machines known as the Kursed. Defeated by Odin's (Anthony Hopkins) predecessor Bor (Tony Curran), the dark elves have since gone into hibernation, waiting for the right moment to return and wield the Aether once more.  In case you're wondering, these dark elves do not wear a hooded cloak and wield two swords -- and until later, their skin is pale white, not dark black.Stumbling into this mess is poor Dr. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), our super-smart damsel in distress who just happens to pass between worlds and absorb the Aether.  It seems the Aether likes to live inside people, making Jane a Distress Ball -- a character to be batted back and forth between Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Odin, and Malekith.  Girl meets god, bad guy steals girl, god saves her and the nine worlds.  You get the idea.Where &#34;The Dark World&#34; rises above its mediocre plot is when Thor teams up with Loki (Tom Hiddleston).  Loki chews the scenery with glee, and the half-brothers' shared pain makes them a snarky combination that's a pleasure to watch. It doesn't last nearly long enough, and in no time Loki's back to being sneaky and Thor's back to hitting things with Meow-Meow -- Dary Lewis' (Kat Dennings) name for Thor's hammer, Mjolnir.The special effects are excellent, including Hemsworth with his shirt off, but that's simply obscuring the fact that despite a planar conjunction and a battle for the universe, &#34;The Dark World&#34; feels trite.

1566637,AKJ9MEE93DG5O,B008JFUS0U,mitchell5954,"[1, 2]","Thor The Dark World is a very action-packed, visually pleasing, and entertaining time at the movies.  I ultimately really enjoyed the movie.  However, the film does have some notable issues.  In many ways Thor 2 is superior to the first film, but in others it is inferior.The film takes place sometime after the Avengers.  Loki (Tom Hiddleston) has been locked up in the prison in Asghard for what he did in New York.  Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and everyone else are fighting to restore peace to the nine realms.  Meanwhile the villain named Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) and his race called the Dark Elves have returned from their slumber.  Their goal is to obtain a substance called Ether to destroy the nine realms and return everything to darkness.  Meanwhile, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and her friends come across a dimensional anomaly.  This is happening because all nine realms are lining up which happens every-so-often.  Because of this she is transported to Asghard and back and is infected with Ether.  Thor must now save Jane and all nine realms from the Dark Elves with the help of Loki.The film has many great qualities.  The effects are amazing.  The effects in the first film were already great, but this film ups the ante.  The effects are twice or even three times better than the first film, as is the world building.  This film showcases more of the nine realms, and also fleshes out Asghard better than the last film did.  The film spends more time in Asghard and in the Dark Elves&#8217; home world than on Earth which I was okay with.  I did not dislike the time spent on Earth like many people did, but I just found the scenes on Asghard and the Ice Realm to be more interesting and fun.  Lastly the action scenes are greatly entertaining, especially the Loki prison break scene.  The action is another thing that is upped in this film.  I also love the design of the Dark Elves.  I also like the technology employed by both the Dark Elves and Asghard.  This film does a better job at showcasing the technology and mythology of these different realms.However, where this film excelled in action and effects, it unfortunately drops the ball when it comes to character.  There is really no character development in this show.  Thor is now a wise leader that puts other first.  Other than having to defeat the bad guy there is no conflict he has to deal with, and he does not change or grow.  Granted, I would rather have a character remain static than regress and forget the lessons they learn from the previous film like in the Iron Man sequels.  However, I would like some form of development for the characters, especially the main ones, but we really do not get that.  Thor, as well as the other main characters are still likable and they never irritated me, but I felt that their characters never went anywhere.Odin and Thor&#8217;s friends in Asghard are given even less to do than in the first film which is saying something.  Those characters did not get much to do in the first film, but I can kind of understand because the film is about Thor learning his lesson and about Loki&#8217;s jealousy.  However, here they are given less to do which is a big missed opportunity.  I heard a lot was cut from this film, which might include more of Odin, Thor&#8217;s friends, and the villain, which the film needed.  I hope we get to see that footage when the film comes to DVD.The villain is extremely boring and lazy as well.  He is probably the weakest kink in this film.  He is a generic villain that wants to destroy the world and the hero must stop him.  He has no dimension or charm like Loki does.  Compared to Loki in the first film and the Avengers this villain is weak.  Even in this film Loki is better, because you constantly question whether you can trust him.Also, they threw in this very forced humor that does not work.  This mainly occurs when we are on Earth.  When we are on Asghard and the other realms the humor they had felt natural and was funny.  Occasionally you get a funny joke, but whenever we are on Earth we are treated to unfunny humor.  We had quite a bit of humor on Earth in the first Thor but, in my opinion, it was not as forced and was actually funny.  I feel that this becoming a thing with these Marvel movies, where they feel the need to through in forced and unnecessary humor.  The Iron Man sequels definitely have this problem.Overall, Thor The Dark World is a very entertaining film.  There is not much dimension past the action and scope, but the characters are still likable and fun and the action and effects are breathtaking.  It is not quite as good as the first film, but is a good movie nonetheless.  I think it is definitely worth a viewing in the theatre.",4,As Good As The First One!,1394841600,"03 15, 2014",2014,4736,"['Thor', 'Dark', 'World', 'very', 'action-packed', 'visually', 'pleasing', 'entertaining', 'time', 'movies', 'ultimately', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'However', 'film', 'have', 'notable', 'issues', 'many', 'ways', 'Thor', '2', 'superior', 'first', 'film', 'others', 'inferior.The', 'film', 'place', 'sometime', 'Avengers', 'Loki', 'Tom', 'Hiddleston', 'been', 'locked', 'up', 'prison', 'Asghard', 'what', 'did', 'New', 'York', 'Thor', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'everyone', 'else', 'are', 'fighting', 'restore', 'peace', 'nine', 'realms', 'Meanwhile', 'villain', 'named', 'Malekith', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'race', 'called', 'Dark', 'Elves', 'have', 'returned', 'slumber', 'goal', 'obtain', 'substance', 'called', 'Ether', 'destroy', 'nine', 'realms', 'return', 'everything', 'darkness', 'Meanwhile', 'Jane', 'Foster', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'friends', 'come', 'dimensional', 'anomaly', 'happening', 'nine', 'realms', 'are', 'lining', 'up', 'every-so-often', 'transported', 'Asghard', 'back', 'infected', 'Ether', 'Thor', 'must', 'now', 'save', 'Jane', 'nine', 'realms', 'Dark', 'Elves', 'help', 'Loki.The', 'film', 'many', 'great', 'qualities', 'effects', 'are', 'amazing', 'effects', 'first', 'film', 'were', 'already', 'great', 'film', 'ante', 'effects', 'are', 'twice', 'even', 'three', 'times', 'better', 'first', 'film', 'world', 'building', 'film', 'more', 'nine', 'realms', 'also', 'out', 'Asghard', 'better', 'last', 'film', 'did', 'film', 'more', 'time', 'Asghard', 'Dark', 'Elves', '8217', 'home', 'world', 'Earth', 'was', 'okay', 'did', 'not', 'dislike', 'time', 'spent', 'Earth', 'many', 'people', 'did', 'just', 'found', 'scenes', 'Asghard', 'Ice', 'Realm', 'be', 'more', 'interesting', 'fun', 'Lastly', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'greatly', 'entertaining', 'especially', 'Loki', 'prison', 'break', 'scene', 'action', 'thing', 'upped', 'film', 'also', 'love', 'design', 'Dark', 'Elves', 'also', 'technology', 'employed', 'Dark', 'Elves', 'Asghard', 'film', 'better', 'job', 'showcasing', 'technology', 'mythology', 'different', 'realms.However', 'where', 'film', 'excelled', 'action', 'effects', 'unfortunately', 'ball', 'when', 'character', 'really', 'character', 'development', 'show', 'Thor', 'now', 'wise', 'leader', 'other', 'first', 'Other', 'having', 'defeat', 'bad', 'guy', 'conflict', 'deal', 'not', 'change', 'grow', 'Granted', 'would', 'rather', 'have', 'character', 'remain', 'static', 'regress', 'forget', 'lessons', 'learn', 'previous', 'film', 'Iron', 'Man', 'sequels', 'However', 'would', 'like', 'form', 'development', 'characters', 'especially', 'main', 'ones', 'really', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'Thor', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'still', 'likable', 'never', 'irritated', 'felt', 'characters', 'never', 'went', 'anywhere.Odin', 'Thor', '8217', 's', 'friends', 'Asghard', 'are', 'given', 'even', 'less', 'do', 'first', 'film', 'saying', 'something', 'characters', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'much', 'do', 'first', 'film', 'can', 'kind', 'understand', 'film', 'Thor', 'learning', 'lesson', 'Loki', '8217', 's', 'jealousy', 'However', 'here', 'are', 'given', 'less', 'do', 'big', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'heard', 'lot', 'was', 'cut', 'film', 'might', 'include', 'more', 'Odin', 'Thor', '8217', 's', 'friends', 'villain', 'film', 'needed', 'hope', 'get', 'see', 'footage', 'when', 'film', 'DVD.The', 'villain', 'extremely', 'boring', 'lazy', 'as', 'well', 'probably', 'weakest', 'kink', 'film', 'generic', 'villain', 'destroy', 'world', 'hero', 'must', 'stop', 'dimension', 'charm', 'Loki', 'Compared', 'Loki', 'first', 'film', 'Avengers', 'villain', 'weak', 'Even', 'film', 'Loki', 'better', 'constantly', 'question', 'can', 'trust', 'him.Also', 'threw', 'very', 'forced', 'humor', 'not', 'work', 'mainly', 'when', 'are', 'Earth', 'When', 'are', 'Asghard', 'other', 'humor', 'had', 'felt', 'natural', 'was', 'funny', 'Occasionally', 'get', 'funny', 'joke', 'are', 'are', 'treated', 'unfunny', 'humor', 'had', 'quite', 'bit', 'humor', 'Earth', 'first', 'Thor', 'opinion', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'forced', 'was', 'actually', 'funny', 'feel', 'becoming', 'thing', 'Marvel', 'movies', 'where', 'feel', 'need', 'forced', 'unnecessary', 'humor', 'Iron', 'Man', 'definitely', 'have', 'problem.Overall', 'Thor', 'Dark', 'World', 'very', 'entertaining', 'film', 'not', 'much', 'dimension', 'action', 'scope', 'characters', 'are', 'still', 'likable', 'fun', 'action', 'effects', 'are', 'breathtaking', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'film', 'good', 'movie', 'nonetheless', 'think', 'definitely', 'worth', 'viewing', 'theatre']",N/A

Mierendorf,"[9, 15]","*This review contains only minor spoilers - merely a short recap of the film's beginning to establish context.Thor and Asgard offer Marvel it's biggest cinematic challenge (likely until Guardians of the Galaxy) in terms of story and characters. It's a mystical world filled aliens, realms, and strange beasts. It's a difficult process to establish the story, and Thor: The Dark World begins like Thor did, begins with a detailed story narrated by Odin (Anthony Hopkins). It establishes our villain, Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) and his motivations. It establishes the plot device - MacGuffin - in the Aether, a powerful fluid that can cast complete darkness across whatever it touches. It's in fact more complicated than that, but the setting is placed.As for our remaining cast, the story takes places immediately after the events in The Avengers. Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is marched in chains to stand before Odin for judgement. Loki's hate for Odin is as strong as ever, although his love for his mother Frigga (Rene Russo) is still strong. Thor on the other hand is busy fixing Loki's mess across the realms. Eventually, we'll see that Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) is discovering strange events related to The Convergence, an aligning of the nine realms. This is how Jane and Thor's lives will overlap.I only detail the story this far as an example of how complicated the story is to setup the remaining events of the film. It's not too complicated that you get lost, but it demonstrates that Marvel has a daunting task with the mystical elements of their cinematic universe. It's a task that they and director Alan Taylor (a few Game of Thrones episodes) handle extremely well. Taylor steers us through an expanded look at the realms, the depths of Asgard and the technologies of the Dark Elves (Malekith and his army). It's also an appropriately dark film, thematically. Lots of people die, there's limb severing, stabbing, slaying and plenty of war battles. Despite that, Marvel never loses it's way and ensures that the writers and Taylor balance that with easily the funniest scenes from any Marvel movie to date.*Malekith is a real threat to Asgard and all of the realms. He isn't easily beaten, his army is supernaturally strong and determined. He and his minions beat Thor and Asgardian troops into submission plenty of times. If there's any complaint with his character is that he's given less screen time than he deserves. His ever-present threat is what drives the film primarily.Chris Hemsworth continues his good performances as Thor, but as usual, Tom Hiddleston steals the film as Loki. It's clear that Hiddleston loves this role and he pours everything he's got into it. Thankfully, more time is given to just Loki and Thor together and they're some of the best scenes of the movie. Hopkins is in ultra-enunciation mode, but it works just fine to establish his role as king. Rene Russo is a real surprise and treat as her role is expanded to give a glimpse of why she's queen and that she can just as easily stand at the ranks of the warriors in her family. Natalie Portman gives a nice performance as well as a few wonderful scenes with Stellan Skarsgrd.Visually, Thor: The Dark World is beautiful. The graphics are impressive, but the sets are just as intricate as Thor, so it's a world that feels real and authentic. Lots of care is given to make the world and story stand on their own and not feel like the strange, mythical world that awkwardly fits into the Earth-centric stories of Captain America and Iron Man. It's a fun, hilarious and yet serious film that moves all of our characters forward on their ultimate journey leading to The Avengers: Age of Ultron and beyond.*[ A scene between Loki and Thor walking together will go down as many people's favorite in the movie, and possibly their favorite scene to date in this Marvel universe.]",5,"Brooding, dark, and hilarious, The Dark World finds that perfect thematic balance.",1383955200,"11 9, 2013",2013,3871,"['*This', 'review', 'only', 'minor', 'spoilers', 'merely', 'short', 'recap', 'film', 'beginning', 'establish', 'context.Thor', 'Asgard', 'offer', 'Marvel', 'biggest', 'cinematic', 'challenge', 'likely', 'Guardians', 'Galaxy', 'terms', 'story', 'characters', 'mystical', 'world', 'filled', 'aliens', 'realms', 'strange', 'beasts', 'difficult', 'process', 'establish', 'story', 'Thor', 'Dark', 'World', 'Thor', 'did', 'detailed', 'story', 'narrated', 'Odin', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'villain', 'Malekith', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'motivations', 'plot', 'device', 'MacGuffin', 'Aether', 'powerful', 'fluid', 'can', 'cast', 'complete', 'darkness', 'fact', 'more', 'complicated', 'setting', 'placed.As', 'remaining', 'cast', 'story', 'places', 'immediately', 'events', 'Avengers', 'Loki', 'Tom', 'Hiddleston', 'marched', 'chains', 'stand', 'Odin', 'judgement', 'Loki', 'hate', 'Odin', 'as', 'strong', 'ever', 'love', 'mother', 'Frigga', 'Rene', 'Russo', 'still', 'strong', 'Thor', 'other', 'hand', 'busy', 'fixing', 'Loki', 'mess', 'realms', 'Eventually', ""'ll"", 'see', 'Jane', 'Foster', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'discovering', 'strange', 'events', 'related', 'Convergence', 'aligning', 'nine', 'realms', 'how', 'Jane', 'Thor', 'lives', 'will', 'overlap.I', 'only', 'detail', 'story', 'far', 'example', 'how', 'complicated', 'story', 'setup', 'remaining', 'events', 'film', 'not', 'too', 'complicated', 'get', 'lost', 'Marvel', 'daunting', 'task', 'mystical', 'elements', 'cinematic', 'universe', 'task', 'director', 'Alan', 'Taylor', 'few', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'episodes', 'handle', 'extremely', 'well', 'Taylor', 'steers', 'expanded', 'look', 'realms', 'depths', 'Asgard', 'technologies', 'Dark', 'Elves', 'Malekith', 'army', 'also', 'appropriately', 'dark', 'film', 'thematically', 'Lots', 'people', 'die', 'limb', 'severing', 'stabbing', 'slaying', 'plenty', 'war', 'battles', 'Marvel', 'never', 'way', 'writers', 'Taylor', 'balance', 'easily', 'funniest', 'scenes', 'Marvel', 'movie', 'date', '*Malekith', 'real', 'threat', 'Asgard', 'realms', ""n't"", 'easily', 'beaten', 'army', 'supernaturally', 'strong', 'determined', 'minions', 'beat', 'Thor', 'Asgardian', 'troops', 'submission', 'plenty', 'times', 'complaint', 'character', 'given', 'less', 'screen', 'time', 'ever-present', 'threat', 'what', 'film', 'primarily.Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'good', 'performances', 'Thor', 'usual', 'Tom', 'Hiddleston', 'film', 'Loki', 'clear', 'Hiddleston', 'role', 'everything', 'got', 'Thankfully', 'more', 'time', 'given', 'just', 'Loki', 'Thor', 'together', ""'re"", 'best', 'scenes', 'movie', 'Hopkins', 'ultra-enunciation', 'mode', 'just', 'fine', 'establish', 'role', 'king', 'Rene', 'Russo', 'real', 'surprise', 'treat', 'role', 'expanded', 'give', 'glimpse', 'why', 'queen', 'can', 'just', 'easily', 'stand', 'ranks', 'warriors', 'family', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'nice', 'performance', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'wonderful', 'scenes', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgrd.Visually', 'Thor', 'Dark', 'World', 'beautiful', 'graphics', 'are', 'impressive', 'sets', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'intricate', 'Thor', 'world', 'real', 'authentic', 'Lots', 'care', 'given', 'make', 'world', 'story', 'stand', 'own', 'not', 'feel', 'strange', 'mythical', 'world', 'awkwardly', 'Earth-centric', 'stories', 'Captain', 'America', 'Iron', 'Man', 'fun', 'hilarious', 'yet', 'serious', 'film', 'characters', 'forward', 'ultimate', 'journey', 'leading', 'Avengers', 'Age', 'Ultron', '*', '[', 'scene', 'Loki', 'Thor', 'walking', 'together', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'as', 'many', 'people', 'favorite', 'movie', 'possibly', 'favorite', 'scene', 'date', 'Marvel', 'universe', ']']",N/A

1566644,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B008JFUS0U,M. Oleson,"[1, 4]","Theatrical review.  There may be spoilers.I was a little surprised that I was quite fond of the original ""Thor"" from 2011.  Like that movie, the scenes created here for the various non-Earth worlds have some spectacular CGI effects.  And like that movie, the most interesting events are on Earth.  This story picks up after ""The Avengers"" but makes references back to Asgard, Thor's (Chris Hemsworth) home planet.Thousands of years earlier, Thor's granddaddy defeated an evil empire (Dark Elves) that was built on destruction of all the planets, er... realms.  The Elves leader at the time, Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) and a few of his top lieutenants, survived but were put in a state of deep sleep.A key ingredient to creating undefeatable power is a wispy red vapor known as the Aether.  Skip ahead a few millennial back to planet Earth.  Thor's human girlfriend, scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) hasn't seen the hunky dude for 2 years as he's trying to bring and everlasting peace to the 9 realms.  Jane and her sidekicks Darcy (Kat Dennings) and Ian (Jonathan Howard) get a tip on an unusual phenomenon at an abandon warehouse.  It turns out, it's the Aether.  How coincidental.So as Thor is bringing a lasting peace, Jane unleashes the Aether which sends a signal of sort to the sleeping Malekith and here we go again.  It's hard enough to keep up with all the various realms, characters and places as it is, so I don't usually get too critical of plot disconnects.  Still I couldn't understand how the father of Odin (Anthony Hopkins) could wipe out the Dark Elves thousands of years earlier, yet when revived, the small group, even without the Aether, seemed to be able to kick Asgardian ass.  Wouldn't Asgard have developed better weapons and defenses during all those centuries?Ultimately the film looks great.  Hemsworth and Portman have a nice chemistry between them even if they never really hook up beyond a few smooches.  Hopkins' Odin is appropriately regal with his gold eye patch and neatly trimmed white beard.  Rene Russo as Thor's mom, Frigga gets a couple nice scenes including cool sword fighting.  Ultimately, the best thing here is Tom Hiddleston's Loki, the bad-boy adopted brother of Thor.  Sentence to life in prison, Loki is released by Thor on the promise that he would help fight Malekith.  He's fun to watch and gets some good lines.  ""The Dark World"" is fine entertainment almost up to the measure of the original.

1566650,A20DRRKAN5Z9Q,B008JFUS0U,Moviedude,"[8, 14]","The first Thor was a problematic film for me. I loved the actors, I loved the Jack-Kirby-perfect Asgard, but the film itself felt flat. Perhaps it was the rather disorganized plot, perhaps it was the way it followed the same strategy as films like Time Guardian and Galaxia, beginning in lush sci-fi locales but migrating to a small town to save money later on. Avengers further attached me to Hemsworth's Thor, and so I was really looking forward to seeing him get a grander, more developed outing. Thor: the Dark World does not disappoint.Once again, the source of troubles is another race of ancient magic aliens, this time the Dark Elves led by their king Malekith (Christopher Eccleston, still failing to buck that Doctor Who typecasting). The Dark Elves (who are more or less the Eldar from Warhammer 40,000 for all intents and purposes) are the longtime enemies of the Asgardians, but after an apocolyptic battle only a handful of them remain. Awakened by the coming alignment of all the worlds connected by Yggdrasil (they hyperspace network that connects all the worlds Thor and his pals hang out on) Malekith and his creepily masked flunkies set out to recover the Ether, a spooky living weapon that will blot out all light in the universe.Predictably conflict ensues. Through a series of accidents the Ether winds up living inside Thor's human sweetheart, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) where it will grow until it devours her. Defying Odin, Thor hatches a surprisingly cunning plan to dupe Malekith into removing the Ether from Foster so he can destroy the Elven leader and his weapon in one go. Things don't go so swimmingly, and it all comes down to a ludicrously silly, magnificently well-done battle across dimensions for the fate of the universe (with a tube ride through London in the middle).If, like me, you loved everything about Thor but just wanted it to be better, then this is the film for you. Thor and Foster's romance, forced and simplistic in the first movie, is played out well here. Asgard, before just a shiny setpiece, is now a well-built series of believable locations with an aged, lived-in feel to them. The Dark Elves, unlike the thuggish Frost Giants, have a technology and martial prowess that seems genuinely threatening. Baddie Eccleston does a decent enough job, although he lacks some of his scenery chewing prowess that we've seen in films like G.I. Joe and 28 Days Later. Even Foster's intern Darcy (Kat Dennings) is a tolerable comic presence this time around. And of course we get more Stellan Skarsgrd, who is always fabulous.Real credit is due, however, to Tom Hiddleston as Loki. I felt sure that after two films as the big bad I'd be sick of him, but his turn as Thor's crafty, somewhat unwilling accomplice is meaty and exciting. You genuinely can't tell how much of his behavior is sincere and how much of it is buildup to some treachery- without giving too much away, even though Loki is on Thor's side in this film, he is by far a more dangerous force than Malekith. Just wait for it.Of course there are also some little tidbits thrown in at the end of the film to foreshadow future installments, which are now all but guaranteed to echo the Infinity Gauntlet storyline (as if seeing Thanos in Avengers wasn't a big enough clue). What this means for the next Avengers and other Marvel properties is anyone's guess, but color me excited as all get out.I can think of very few bad things to say about this film to counterbalance the good. Sif and the Warriors Three are still rather underused (but then Thor already has another super team) and Idris Elba's Heimdall is still solidly a supporting character (although he does fight a spaceship using parkour and stabbing, so that's pretty cool). There are also some effects that seem a little odd- a thrown boulder near the middle looks a little wobbly-fake, and in the climax Malekith grows to enormous proportions which is not really made clear until he starts fighting Thor. By and large, though, this is a very very good film, and the acting, writing and visuals are nearly above reproach.Pros:-Exactly like the first Thor only better-Boasts a big sense of scale and tension-Skilled cast elevates it above just a comic book movieCons:-A few wonky effects here and there-Lacks the memorable, bombastic theme music we've seen in other Marvel films",5,One of those rare sequels that surpasses the original in all respects.,1383955200,"11 9, 2013",2013,4349,"['first', 'Thor', 'was', 'problematic', 'film', 'loved', 'actors', 'loved', 'Jack-Kirby-perfect', 'Asgard', 'film', 'felt', 'flat', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'rather', 'disorganized', 'plot', 'perhaps', 'was', 'way', 'followed', 'same', 'strategy', 'films', 'Time', 'Guardian', 'Galaxia', 'beginning', 'lush', 'sci-fi', 'locales', 'migrating', 'small', 'town', 'save', 'money', 'later', 'Avengers', 'further', 'attached', 'Hemsworth', 'Thor', 'so', 'was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'get', 'grander', 'more', 'developed', 'outing', 'Thor', 'Dark', 'World', 'not', 'disappoint.Once', 'again', 'source', 'troubles', 'race', 'ancient', 'magic', 'aliens', 'time', 'Dark', 'Elves', 'led', 'king', 'Malekith', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'still', 'failing', 'buck', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'typecasting', 'Dark', 'Elves', 'who', 'are', 'more', 'less', 'Eldar', 'Warhammer', '40,000', 'intents', 'purposes', 'are', 'longtime', 'enemies', 'Asgardians', 'apocolyptic', 'battle', 'only', 'handful', 'remain', 'Awakened', 'coming', 'alignment', 'worlds', 'connected', 'Yggdrasil', 'hyperspace', 'network', 'worlds', 'Thor', 'pals', 'hang', 'out', 'Malekith', 'creepily', 'masked', 'flunkies', 'set', 'out', 'recover', 'Ether', 'spooky', 'living', 'weapon', 'will', 'blot', 'out', 'light', 'universe.Predictably', 'conflict', 'ensues', 'series', 'accidents', 'Ether', 'up', 'living', 'Thor', 'human', 'sweetheart', 'Jane', 'Foster', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'where', 'will', 'grow', 'Defying', 'Odin', 'Thor', 'surprisingly', 'cunning', 'plan', 'dupe', 'Malekith', 'removing', 'Ether', 'Foster', 'can', 'destroy', 'Elven', 'leader', 'weapon', 'one', 'go', 'Things', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'so', 'swimmingly', 'down', 'ludicrously', 'silly', 'magnificently', 'well-done', 'battle', 'dimensions', 'fate', 'universe', 'tube', 'ride', 'London', 'middle', '.If', 'loved', 'everything', 'Thor', 'just', 'wanted', 'be', 'better', 'then', 'film', 'Thor', 'Foster', 'romance', 'forced', 'simplistic', 'first', 'movie', 'played', 'out', 'well', 'here', 'Asgard', 'before', 'just', 'shiny', 'setpiece', 'now', 'well-built', 'series', 'believable', 'locations', 'aged', 'lived-in', 'feel', 'Dark', 'Elves', 'thuggish', 'Frost', 'Giants', 'have', 'technology', 'martial', 'prowess', 'genuinely', 'threatening', 'Baddie', 'Eccleston', 'decent', 'enough', 'job', 'scenery', 'chewing', 'prowess', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'films', 'G.I', 'Joe', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'Even', 'Foster', 'intern', 'Darcy', 'Kat', 'Dennings', 'tolerable', 'comic', 'presence', 'time', 'around', 'course', 'get', 'more', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgrd', 'who', 'always', 'fabulous.Real', 'credit', 'due', 'however', 'Tom', 'Hiddleston', 'Loki', 'felt', 'sure', 'two', 'films', 'big', 'bad', ""'d"", 'be', 'sick', 'turn', 'Thor', 'crafty', 'somewhat', 'unwilling', 'accomplice', 'meaty', 'exciting', 'genuinely', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'how', 'much', 'behavior', 'sincere', 'how', 'much', 'buildup', 'treachery-', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'even', 'Loki', 'Thor', 'side', 'film', 'far', 'more', 'dangerous', 'force', 'Malekith', 'Just', 'wait', 'it.Of', 'course', 'are', 'also', 'little', 'tidbits', 'thrown', 'end', 'film', 'foreshadow', 'future', 'installments', 'are', 'now', 'guaranteed', 'echo', 'Infinity', 'Gauntlet', 'storyline', 'seeing', 'Thanos', 'Avengers', 'was', ""n't"", 'big', 'enough', 'clue', 'What', 'next', 'Avengers', 'other', 'Marvel', 'properties', 'anyone', 'guess', 'color', 'excited', 'get', 'out.I', 'can', 'think', 'very', 'few', 'bad', 'things', 'say', 'film', 'counterbalance', 'good', 'Sif', 'Warriors', 'Three', 'are', 'still', 'rather', 'underused', 'then', 'Thor', 'already', 'super', 'team', 'Idris', 'Elba', 'Heimdall', 'still', 'solidly', 'supporting', 'character', 'fight', 'spaceship', 'using', 'parkour', 'stabbing', 'pretty', 'cool', 'are', 'also', 'effects', 'seem', 'little', 'odd-', 'thrown', 'boulder', 'middle', 'little', 'wobbly-fake', 'climax', 'Malekith', 'enormous', 'proportions', 'not', 'really', 'made', 'clear', 'fighting', 'Thor', 'large', 'though', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'acting', 'writing', 'visuals', 'are', 'nearly', 'reproach.Pros', '-Exactly', 'first', 'Thor', 'only', 'big', 'sense', 'scale', 'tension-Skilled', 'cast', 'just', 'comic', 'book', 'movieCons', '-A', 'few', 'wonky', 'effects', 'here', 'there-Lacks', 'memorable', 'bombastic', 'theme', 'music', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'Marvel', 'films']",N/A

Click on me.Are you still here?.......Good.Awhile back I posted a review for the first Thor film. I loved the movie but loathed the 3D transfer. Considering it was a film made by the all mighty powers at Disney/Marvel I was horrified at how bad it looked in 3D.Lets now fast forward to 2014 and here we are now with Thor: The Dark World. I was really hesitant to buy this. Sure The Avengers had a great 3D transfer but perhaps that would prove to be the diamond in the rough?I can say with full confidence and joy that Thor 2 in 3D looks wicked good and isn't plagued with any of the problems the first film had (in regards to 3D).Visually, The Dark World even without  3D is a gorgeous affair. Asgard looks vibrant and enchanting. On a purely visual level it leaves you begging to see more of the thunder gods home world. Then when you add that 3D layer on top of it,this ends up being a real knockout to look at. A few scenes really do look striking in 3D,while the rest is a very serviceable transfer that's sure to make most of us 3D buffs happy.If you want my quick opinion on the movie itself I really enjoyed it,though I felt Malekith was kind of thrown in their as nothing more but a plot point, and to give Thor someone to fight just for the sake of fighting. I thought the further developments with Loki were awesome and that Tom Hiddleston stole the show.Botton line: Thor: The Dark World Triumphs were the original film failed with it's 3D conversion,and on top of that this is a great sequel as well. definitely worth the 3D purchase if you're a fan.",4,"4 stars for the film,4 stars for the 3D.

1566664,A2X9QECJ5W6DOK,B008JFUS0U,Natalie W,"[6, 9]","I really didn't know what to expect with Thor: The Dark World. I loved the first film to pieces and really thought it couldn't get better than that.Well, it did.It completely surpassed my expectations and was probably the most fun I've had watching a Marvel movie since The Avengers; and even though I really liked Iron Man 3, Thor was easily the better movie of the two. The cast is once again fantastic, but I'm going to single out Tom Hiddleston in particular. God, he's just so perfect for Loki. He gives him the perfect balance.: Not too jovial, yet not the Ultimate Master of Evil either. I see Loki as the 10-year-old in a man's body kind of thing and Hiddleston pulls it off extremely well.There's a little more humor weaved into the story this time, which can be both great and a drag at the same time. I felt like the quips in the first half of the film were well-placed and entertaining, but during the second half, it felt like humor was just thrown in there to be funny, though I will admit that I thought all scenes with Stellan Skarsgard were fantastic.The pacing is a bit of a mixed bag. Overall, I thought it was a pretty well-paced movie. The beginning is a little slow, but quickly picks up, so the viewer won't really have time to be bored. Another thing that I really appreciated was the fact that the writers were able to stay focused on the main plot. That was one *huge* problem with Iron Man 3 that I failed to realize until I was watching The Dark World in the theater earlier today. As  much as I love Shane Black's work; Drew Pearce should've stopped him and told him to slow down a little. The characters don't need to be doing 75 different things at one time. People won't be bored by them just doing a couple things at once, it makes the story flow so much better.As mentioned, the cast is great and all seem to have great chemistry with each other. The only new character that bugged me was Darcy's intern.So, if you enjoyed the first film, see this for sure. Some may not enjoy that there's more humor, but the overall pace and dedication to the plot makes up for the cheesy humor in the second half.

Thor did however make the premise of The Avengers feel a lot more tangible to moviegoers.  The rest, as they say, is history. Thor was followed by Captain American which was then followed by The Avengers.  As we wait for The Avengers 2, the cycle repeats and we&#8217;re treated to individual superhero films again, now up&#8230; Thor: The Dark World.The &#8220;God of Thunder&#8221; Thor must stop the Dark Elves, a dangerous and ancient race from obtaining the Aether, a substance capable of destroying Asgard, Earth and the rest of the universe.  With the help of Jane Foster and his treacherous brother Loki, Thor puts into action a daring plan to save the universe and banish the Elves forever.Most of the cast of the original Thor returns.  The main exception being the minor role of Fandral; originally portrayed by Josh Dallas he was replaced by Chuck&#8217;s Zachary Levi.  Chris Hemsworth slips back into the role that made him a household name almost effortlessly and continues to be ferocious and charming.  Coming as no surprise Tom Hiddleston continues to be a scene stealer despite his character being &#34;locked up&#34; for most of the film.Other Thor actors, namely Idris Elba, Stellan Skarsgrd, Anthony Hopkins, Jamie Alexander and Ray Stevenson put in inspired performances even with their limited screen time. Natalie Portman's performance is a little harder to diagnose; reportedly she was unhappy when original director Patty Jenkins left the project and was contractually compelled to appear in the film.  Perhaps I'm reading too much into the reported dispute but I didn't feel she had as much enthusiasm for this project as the original.While those appearing in front of the camera mostly stay the same the talent behind the scenes has changed dramatically.  Gone are writers Ashley Miller, Zack Stentz and Don Wayne and director Kenneth Branagh.  The writing staff consists of five writers; Christopher Yost, Christopher Markus, Stephen McFeely, Don Payne, and Robert Rodat while the directing duties have fallen to Alan Taylor.  Mostly known for his TV work Taylor does have experience directing features but it's his background on the small screen that sets him up for success as he shows finesse in handling the film's more personal moments.Finding the right balance between drama and humor can be a difficult tightrope to walk but for the most part Thor handles it quite well... up until the third act.  Then, at the most inopportune time some issues regarding the film's balance and tone start to derail The Dark World and rob it of its sense of urgency and danger.  It's not a deal breaking problem but it does hold the film back from having a truly memorable climax.Thor: The Dark World has been given two Blu-ray releases; a standard 2D release and a 3D version which also includes the 2D version on a separate disc.  The 3D version also includes a digital copy.The 2D presentation is flawless.  Black levels are inky, the color palette is vibrant (on Asgard especially) and flesh tones are natural and lifelike.  Detail consistently wows; everything from the fine stubble of Thor&#8217;s beard to minute costume textures are clearly visible.  I couldn&#8217;t find a single negative quality to nitpick about the 2D transfer, it&#8217;s simply outstanding.The 3D version of the film isn&#8217;t quite as successful as its 2D counterpart.  Brightly lit scenes look fantastic; there&#8217;s little to no crosstalk, colors still pop and there&#8217;s very little drop off in terms of detail.  Much of the 3D effect doesn&#8217;t always &#8220;jump&#8221; out of the screen, instead it&#8217;s used to create a greater sense of depth.  That may disappoint some viewers but I prefer 3D to be used like a scalpel and not an ax.  The transfer runs into some trouble during the numerous dark or dimly lit scenes.  The 3D effect just doesn&#8217;t pop as much and you may find yourself struggling more to digest what you&#8217;re looking at.  With that said, even at its worst The Dark World&#8217;s 3D presentation is equal to or better than that of the first Thor&#8217;s 3D Blu-ray.There should be no complaints about the well balanced and aggressive DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 surround track.  Dialogue is always crisp and intelligible, the surrounds provide plenty of ambient noise and when needed some appropriate directional effects, and Brian Tyler&#8217;s score is well balanced.  This is nothing short of what you&#8217;d expect from one of Marvel&#8217;s signature cinematic properties.Special features range from the mundane to the extraordinary.  The signature special feature is the Marvel One Shot: All Hail the King fourteen minute long short film starring Ben Kingsley from Iron Man 3.  It's a fun little companion piece that gives a little insight to one of the most intriguing side characters of the Marvel universe.  You'll also find a commentary with director Alan Taylor, cinematographer Kramer Morgenthau, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige, and actor Tom Hiddleston; the track is a bit dry but is informative.  The thirty-two minute long documentary A Brother's Journey: Thor & Loki explores the casting, performances, stories and relationship between the hero and villain.  Wrapping things up is a some short featurette about the Brian Tyler's score, eight minutes of deleted or extended scenes, a first look at Captain America: The Winter Soldier and a short gag reel.  Most of the extras are merely okay but the All Hail the King short improves the whole package.The greatest thing that can be said about Thor: The Dark World is that it doesn't suffer from &#8220;sequelitis&#8221; like so many other sequels in recent years.  By avoiding the same fate of other recent sequels like Iron Man 2 and Star Trek: Into Darkness this film sets up the Thor franchise for continued success and keeps the Marvel movie machine moving full speed ahead.  The 2D & 3D transfers are top notch as is the DTS audio track, that in addition to the above average special features makes Thor: The Dark World an easy to recommend Blu-ray.",4,"Thor: The Dark World

1566678,A1DJYI522AO1MN,B008JFUS0U,"Noah Arsenault ""Winter's Read""","[94, 125]","Thor: The Dark World is, in short, a hit. With a new and different threat, the battle takes place behind the lines, in wastelands, and on metropolis Earth, rather than the cold world and small town scene of the first film. Trickery, subtlety, and cunning take the place of brute force this time, and it's a good direction to take.The characters, for the large part now established, were furthered well. Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) was played well, but could have spoken up a great deal more near the end. It should have been more shocking when he finally spoke English, in fact I don't recall the exact moment he started.The action in this film was great, but skipped a few beats at times, which is forgivable this time with Loki's interchanges with Thor. Marvel did meet my expectations with intermittent comedy, once again. This sequel was full of it, and each time it was written and performed very well, and got a laugh from the whole audience.The movie is family-friendly except for fantasy violence, two moments of direct violence, partial nudity (a character is shown in public on television, but is thankfully censored), and less worrying details seen here.

1566679,A292163FE9C117,B008JFUS0U,"Norma Beishir ""author, The Unicorn's Daughter""","[11, 18]","I've been looking forward to the second installment in Thor's story ever since I saw the first back in 2011--but at the same time, I've had some concerns. What I loved most about the first movie--Thor's fish-out-of-water experiences during his exile on earth--would have to be absent this time around. After all, Thor's spent considerable time on earth by now (okay, so it was spent in battle with the other five Avengers in what has come to be known in the Marvel universe as The Battle of New York).As it turns out, however, the God of Thunder still has a lot to learn about this planet. Though Thor: The Dark World is decidedly darker than the first movie, it still manages to deliver enough in the humor department, mostly thanks to the big guy himself (Chris Hemsworth, who I suspect was created in a lab somewhere just for this role) and his wayward adopted brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston, who's made being a bad guy a good thing).Most of the usual suspects are back: Natalie Portman as Jane Foster, who's been waiting not-so-patiently for two years for Thor to return; Stellan Skarsgard as Dr. Erik Selvig, damaged by Loki's possession in The Avengers, is behaving erratically (running around naked at Stonehenge in front of TV cameras is pretty erratic, don't you think?) and toting a huge bag full of prescription drugs...Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings), who finds a little romance in the middle of chaos...Odin (Anthony Hopkins), who, let's face it, is never going to be named Father of the Year...Frigga (Rene Russo), the only person in the Nine Realms who Loki actually loves (who do you think taught Loki that bag of tricks?)...Heimdall (Idris Elba), Sif (Jaimie Alexander), and the Warriors Three (Ray Stevenson, Tadanobu Asano and Zachary Levi, replacing Joshua Dallas as Fandral)--all committing treason with Thor and Loki in order to save Asgard and avenge Frigga's death--the result of an invasion of Asgard by Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) and his Dark Elves, searching for the substance that can restore the universe to total darkness.Thor knows he can't trust Loki, but also knows this is a war he can't win without his brother. &#34;Trust my rage,&#34; Loki suggests.The best dialogue in the movie is, without a doubt, between Thor and Loki. The visuals are stunning--Asgard is even more beautiful than I remember it from the first Thor (Asgardian funerals are resplendent, and their prisons are downright classy), and the action is intense, as the battle rages on throughout the Nine Realms via portals similar to the one in which the Chitauri invaded New York in The Avengers.As with the first movie, my favorite moments involve humor--Thor hanging his mythical hammer, Mjolnir, on a coat rack; trying to take the subway to Greenwich; squeezing into Jane's small vehicle (I'm still trying to picture Chris Hemsworth in a Formula One racer in Rush!); Stan Lee's cameo in a mental hospital; and the end credits scene involving something from Jotunheim that came to Earth through an open portal and remains in London. I would love to see Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) and his Agents of SHIELD be summoned to deal with it!I'm going to have to disagree with the reviewers who refer to Thor as &#34;a meathead.&#34; An intelligent person is smart enough to know he doesn't have all the answers and seeks out those who do; a meathead is too dumb to know he's dumb. Thor is far from stupid.The movie's ending leaves a few important unanswered questions, and the first of the two end-credits scenes offers a foreshadowing of things to come.Thanos, anyone?My only disappointment: not enough romance. Thor's a pretty hot guy with two women, Jane and Sif, clearly in love with him...yet he doesn't seem to have done the horizontal samba with either of them. I realize this is Disney, where the only place you can find sex is in a dictionary, but come on! You don't have to be graphic--just fade to black as movies used to do! A guy cannot possibly look like Thor and still be a virgin! He had one shirtless scene in the whole movie, and he was alone. Now that really stretches credibility to its limits.I'll bet Loki's been in more than a few ladies' chambers....",5,The Dysfunctional Asgardian Royals Are At It Again....,1383955200,"11 9, 2013",2013,4169,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'looking', 'forward', 'second', 'installment', 'Thor', 'story', 'ever', 'saw', 'first', 'back', '2011', 'same', 'time', ""'ve"", 'had', 'concerns', 'What', 'loved', 'most', 'first', 'movie', 'Thor', 'fish-out-of-water', 'experiences', 'exile', 'earth', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'absent', 'time', 'around', 'Thor', 'spent', 'considerable', 'time', 'earth', 'now', 'okay', 'was', 'spent', 'battle', 'other', 'five', 'Avengers', 'what', 'come', 'be', 'known', 'Marvel', 'universe', 'Battle', 'New', 'York', '.As', 'out', 'however', 'God', 'Thunder', 'still', 'lot', 'learn', 'planet', 'Thor', 'Dark', 'World', 'decidedly', 'darker', 'first', 'movie', 'still', 'deliver', 'enough', 'humor', 'department', 'mostly', 'big', 'guy', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'who', 'suspect', 'was', 'created', 'lab', 'somewhere', 'just', 'role', 'wayward', 'adopted', 'brother', 'Loki', 'Tom', 'Hiddleston', 'who', 'made', 'being', 'bad', 'guy', 'good', 'thing', '.Most', 'usual', 'suspects', 'are', 'back', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'Jane', 'Foster', 'who', 'been', 'waiting', 'not-so-patiently', 'two', 'years', 'Thor', 'return', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgard', 'Dr.', 'Erik', 'Selvig', 'damaged', 'Loki', 'possession', 'Avengers', 'behaving', 'erratically', 'running', 'around', 'naked', 'Stonehenge', 'front', 'TV', 'cameras', 'pretty', 'erratic', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'toting', 'huge', 'bag', 'full', 'prescription', 'drugs', 'Darcy', 'Lewis', 'Kat', 'Dennings', 'who', 'little', 'romance', 'middle', 'chaos', 'Odin', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'who', 'let', 'face', 'never', 'going', 'be', 'named', 'Father', 'Year', 'Frigga', 'Rene', 'Russo', 'only', 'person', 'Nine', 'Realms', 'who', 'Loki', 'actually', 'who', 'do', 'think', 'taught', 'Loki', 'bag', 'tricks', 'Heimdall', 'Idris', 'Elba', 'Sif', 'Jaimie', 'Alexander', 'Warriors', 'Three', 'Ray', 'Stevenson', 'Tadanobu', 'Asano', 'Zachary', 'Levi', 'replacing', 'Joshua', 'Dallas', 'Fandral', 'committing', 'treason', 'Thor', 'Loki', 'order', 'save', 'Asgard', 'avenge', 'Frigga', 'death', 'result', 'invasion', 'Asgard', 'Malekith', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'Dark', 'Elves', 'searching', 'substance', 'can', 'restore', 'universe', 'total', 'darkness.Thor', 'ca', ""n't"", 'trust', 'Loki', 'also', 'war', 'ca', ""n't"", 'win', 'brother', '34', 'Trust', 'rage', '34', 'Loki', 'suggests.The', 'best', 'dialogue', 'movie', 'doubt', 'Thor', 'Loki', 'visuals', 'are', 'stunning', 'Asgard', 'even', 'more', 'beautiful', 'remember', 'first', 'Thor', 'Asgardian', 'funerals', 'are', 'resplendent', 'prisons', 'are', 'downright', 'classy', 'action', 'intense', 'battle', 'Nine', 'Realms', 'portals', 'similar', 'one', 'Chitauri', 'invaded', 'New', 'York', 'Avengers.As', 'first', 'movie', 'favorite', 'moments', 'involve', 'humor', 'Thor', 'hanging', 'mythical', 'hammer', 'Mjolnir', 'coat', 'rack', 'trying', 'take', 'subway', 'Greenwich', 'squeezing', 'Jane', 'small', 'vehicle', ""'m"", 'still', 'trying', 'picture', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'Formula', 'One', 'racer', 'Rush', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'cameo', 'mental', 'hospital', 'end', 'scene', 'involving', 'something', 'Jotunheim', 'came', 'Earth', 'open', 'portal', 'London', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'Agent', 'Coulson', 'Clark', 'Gregg', 'Agents', 'SHIELD', 'be', 'summoned', 'deal', ""'m"", 'going', 'have', 'disagree', 'reviewers', 'who', 'refer', 'Thor', '34', 'meathead.', '34', 'intelligent', 'person', 'smart', 'enough', 'know', ""n't"", 'have', 'answers', 'out', 'who', 'do', 'meathead', 'too', 'dumb', 'know', 'dumb', 'Thor', 'far', 'stupid.The', 'movie', 'ending', 'few', 'important', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'first', 'two', 'end-credits', 'scenes', 'foreshadowing', 'things', 'come.Thanos', 'anyone', 'only', 'disappointment', 'not', 'enough', 'romance', 'Thor', 'pretty', 'hot', 'guy', 'two', 'women', 'Jane', 'Sif', 'clearly', 'love', 'yet', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'done', 'horizontal', 'samba', 'realize', 'Disney', 'where', 'only', 'place', 'can', 'find', 'sex', 'dictionary', 'come', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'graphic', 'just', 'fade', 'black', 'movies', 'used', 'do', 'guy', 'can', 'not', 'possibly', 'look', 'Thor', 'still', 'be', 'virgin', 'had', 'one', 'shirtless', 'scene', 'whole', 'movie', 'was', 'alone', 'Now', 'really', 'credibility', 'limits.I', ""'ll"", 'bet', 'Loki', 'been', 'more', 'few', 'ladies', 'chambers']",N/A

1566689,A27L5L6I7OSV5B,B008JFUS0U,Otto Correct,"[16, 19]","The first Thor film was quite a surprise to me and my wife.  I was never into the comics (more of an X-Men and Spider-Man kid growing up) but we borrowed the DVD from a friend who was super into all the MCU movies and insisted we see the individual films that preceded the Avengers.  Of the whole lot he lent us, Thor ended up being the surprise favorite (almost edging out Iron Man as my fav Marvel movie at that point).  Here was a convincingly realized blend of sci-fi and fantasy that emphasized character relationships over flashy special effects (though it had tons of those too :D ) and starred a hero that was big on heart and easy to root for.Thanks to a $5 Ticket Tuesday deal at the local cinema, my wife and I happily plunked down the ten bucks it took for her and me to see Thor: The Dark World.  How does it stack up to its predecessor?Honestly, its at least as good if not better than the first!  The story goes that a long long time ago, in a galaxy far far away, the Dark Elves led by Malekith (oddly enough, played by my favoritedoctor... maybe it was the ears?) wanna kill everything and the Asgardians, led by Thor's grandpa, kick their butts... well, almost.  The Dark Elves have this thing called the Aether, basically a big dangerous mass of floating Pepsi, and it can apparently destroy all life, which the Dark Elves wanna use to do just that when the 9 realms align and allow easy (and random, as we'll soon see) travel between the realms.  The Asgardians have hidden the Aether and the remaining Dark Elves lay in wait for another chance to strike.As you may have guessed, the Dark Elves are evil.  We also know they're evil because they look scary, they fly around in spaceships that look like ashen golf tees that are apparently coal powered given the soot that pours out of them (btw, how funny is it that I'm writing about elves in coal powered spaceships on December 24th?), they apparently sleep by being suspended from their faces in some HR Giger looking device straight outtaAlien, and if one of the Dark Elves wants to become some kinda superwarrior, Malekith cuts open the guy's side, shoves a piece of charcoal in 'em, and turns him into the bass player from GWAR.  As I said, they're evil.Flash forward 5000 years to modern times, and the 9 realms are about to align again, as they do every 5000 years (incidentally, in this film, every planet inhabited with life apparently has the same length year as Earth does).  On Asgard, Loki is being locked in prison forever (yeah, we all know how long that's gonna last) and Thor just got back from beating down one of the 9 realms that was rebelling against Asgard and is trying to celebrate with his warrior pals: the viking dude, the raven haired warrior chick who has a crush on him, and that three musketeers guy (now played byChuckfor some reason), but he can't because he's sad about Natalie Portman and misses her.Back on earth, The scientist who had his mind controlled by Loki in the Avengers is crazy and running around England naked.  Also in England is Natalie Portman who is trying to cope with Thor not being around by agreeing to a blind date with Roy fromthe IT Crowdwhen Darcy busts in and says they found something weird.  Turns out they stumbled on a spot in an abandoned hallway where they can drop whatever they want into the spot and it disappears.  What it ends up being is a place where the realms have intersected, creating a portal between dimensions (these portals will hereby be referred to as ""plot holes"").  To make a way too long summary shorter, Portman falls into a plot hole and finds the floating Pepsi, which absorbs into her body.  Thor finds Portman and takes her to Asgard as the Dark Elves start to formulate their attack.Will Thor manage to get the floating Pepsi out of Portman before its too late?  Will Loki get out of jail?  Will anyone actually trust him for some reason if he does?  Will the Dark Elves use their magic Pepsi to destroy all life, even if that means they apparently die too?  Will the plot holes provide many points of convenience for the otherwise impossible situations our heroes will find themselves in?  Will ANY of the Asgardian gaurds finally start using guns since every one of their enemies seem to have them?  Will the crazy scientist ever find PANTS????Lest my sarcasm fool anyone, this movie, while fairly ridiculous, is also totally awesome, and I loved every second of it.  As convoluted and crazy as some of the plot is, the movie manages to juggle it all pretty well and places it in a universe where this stuff actually seems like it can happen.  The humor is abundant but never twee, the fantastic action sequences remind me of what potential the modern Star Wars films could've had if someone other than George Lucas had the creative control, and the strong interpersonal dynamics of the characters (a key strength of the first Thor movie) remain, never getting eclipsed by the great action.If you hate these kind of comic book flicks, this one absolutely won't change your mind, but if you liked the first Thor, or any of the MCU movies, this is a *very* worthy entry, imho easily beating out Iron Man 2 and 3, as well as Captain America and either of the Hulk movies.

The grenade does not explode, but rather create this black hole that sucks the person into it. It's amazing to watch, but annoying when I realize that the Asgardians brought a sword to a laser black hole grenade fight.Another thing that is weird is that these people are supposed to be the most powerful and wisest folks in the Universe; yet, their political system is based on blood. Why don't they have a democracy? It's so easy for Loki to take the throne, which is really disturbing. In case you did not know. He killed a lot of people in ""The Avengers.""I feel like the Asgardians should have had democracy at least thousands of years ago and by now they should be at some more evolved system of government. The Asgardians are not innovative and probably should not be ruling the nine realms.In addition, Asgardians talk a lot of s*** about how humans are like goats, but if you think about It, it took humans a few centuries to get democracy going, so we are not goats at all. Last time I checked goats are still eating grass and jumping off cliffs. Humans at least have the sense to liquefy grass and sell it for $3.Anyway, I know it's not real, but s*** man.

1566707,A7DAL9PK7F4M1,B008JFUS0U,"Paul Donovan ""Paul Donovan""","[33, 221]","One of the worst movies of 2013, this is the second chapter in the adventures of Thor the Cosmic Douchebag and his magical hammer. Spoiler alert: this is the one where, despite living for thousands of years, with a duty to protect all life in the whole universe, he falls in love with Jane, a human mortal who will die in about 40 years. She also happens to be Earth&#8217;s dumbest astrophysicist.But I&#8217;m getting ahead of myself. The movie begins a long time ago, in a galaxy far far away, where some bad guys are fighting some good guys. You can tell who the bad guys are because they are called Dark Elves. Their warriors are called Kursed, and they are apparently the only beings in the entire universe that don&#8217;t speak English.  Anyway, the Dark Elves want to take some red mist called the Aether, which is &#8220;the most powerful weapon in the universe&#8221;, and kill everyone (yes, there&#8217;s a lot of talk about &#8220;the universe&#8221; in this movie. You can&#8217;t get more epic than that.) Luckily, Thor&#8217;s grandfather wins, and hides &#8220;the most powerful weapon in the universe&#8221; in a rock.Fast forward to present day. Some kind of &#8220;convergence of the Nine Realms of the universe&#8221; is getting ready to happen, and it&#8217;s focused on England. This makes parts of Earth act all wacky. Jane&#8217;s science team finds one of these places - if you throw things into it, it makes them disappear. So they decide to throw their car keys into it. Then Jane decides to wander off by herself. She runs into the rock that hides the Aether, and it infects her, which wakes up the bad guys. Then some other stuff happens that is even less believable.Visually, the movie is interesting. Even though a lot of it is copied from Star Wars movies, it&#8217;s still fun to let it bounce off your eyeballs. Unfortunately, that&#8217;s the only positive thing I can say about the movie. The script is not just bad, it&#8217;s embarrassing. For a plot that revolves around the laws of physics, none of the three screenwriters seem to have heard of it (pro tip, guys: putting the word &#8220;quantum&#8221; in front of other words doesn&#8217;t count as an explanation. Oh, and a physicist would never exclaim, &#8220;It will tear the fabric of reality apart!&#8221;).Thor is such a fratboy Superhero that it&#8217;s impossible to take him seriously. He tosses his hair around, flexes his muscles, and likes to party. He stops wars and saves the day multiple times on multiple planets, but then he gets all weepy over some puny earth girl that he just met and who will be dead before he has time to hit the gym.The movie is stupid, silly, and boring.

It also had a lot of action and suspense, but it also is kind of confusing at times because it switches back and forth through different worlds a lot.This movie is all about a girl named Jane (played by Natalie Portman) who is a scientist and is the girlfriend of Thor (who is played by Chris Hemsworth) who found this place that had a red substance under a rock called the Ether. This substance is absorbed into Jane&#8217;s body and whenever someone touches her, the Ether zaps them by using her energy and makes Jane pass out every time. There are these evil elves who are trying to get the Ether to destroy the whole universe. The leader of the elves is Malekith. Now the king (Thor&#8217;s farther) advises against going against Malekith but he does it anyway.The main characters in the movie are Thor, Jane, Loki, Malekith, Odin, and Darcy. My favorite character in this movie is Darcy because she is really funny and really cool. She is also pretty amazing to help out to save the world.My favorite part in the movie is when, at the very beginning of the movie, Jane found a building that seemed normal but when she went inside they found out that in the building there are secret passage ways that you can&#8217;t see and low gravity, which means that you can pick up a gasoline truck with one finger! Why I like this part so much is because Jane found the Ether under a rock which went into her body and could not be taken out! The weirdest part was that when it went in her body, it seemed like it was 1 minute but it turns out that she was gone for 5 hours!I recommend this movie for ages 11 and up because this movie is pretty scary and pretty intense that I don&#8217;t think a younger audience would enjoy it.

And let me say i liked it alot. This movie continue thors story from the avengers and reveals alot of what happened after Thor went back to Asgard. I wont spoil anything for you all but it is a great movie and i have to say alot better than the first. Here is my breakdown:the goodThis movie answered alot of questions that had been lingering since avengers. We get to know what happened between jane and thor, what punishment did loki get, what happened when the tesseract was returned, what about some of the other realms, what about selvig and darcy these all get answered. the action is fast paced when it gets started and it also leaves alot open for a third thor movie. Loki is as evil as ever and the growth of thor from the avengers continues. Before he was a child in avenges you saw him grow up a little in this one you see him mature to something even more mature sometimes than odin. Also the secret scenes are a treat for marvel fans The extras are good especially the inside look at Captain America:The Winter Soldier and the marvel one shot all hail the king, the rest is the usual gag reel, deleted scenes, scoring the movie. But the treat for thor fans will be thor and Loki blood bothers. Which is a look inside loki and thor and their relationship and how it has evolved so far.the badfirst for a ancient species like the asgard to not have better defenses seems a little out there during some of the scenes.

This sequel had a lot to live up to in my eyes, but never met the challenge.Alan Taylor didn't quite bring the charm that Kenneth Branagh brought to the first film. Then again, I'm not going to blame Alan Taylor. Word is he had a lot of fights with studio over many aspects of the film, particularly it's tone. The studio won. The trailer for the film made it look so epic, but the film itself was, well, that brings me to my first point.The film's tone was pretty uneven, but that can probably be credited to the studio for abusing their influence over the film.(I know first hand how frustrating that can be. (I feel you pain Taylor.)Other parts of the film I had problem's with were the humor, which did not feel at all genuine(at parts at least, Some jokes were pretty funny.) In the first film, Kat Dennings character was the films mail source of humor, but in this film, all of her jokes felt too forced.The character development for the villain was terrible.

Sure, there's some half-assed scientific explanation for all of it but the end result is a little disappointing. Malekith was a bad-ass looking villain, but not very engaging or charismatic. There were also a few too many narrative conveniences, a couple involving Loki's ability to impersonate other people.

Marvel continues their excellent portrayal of their universe picking up where we left off with the last Avengers film.Family:Loki clearly has family issues. His father is disgusted with him, considering that Loki&#8217;s fate should have been dying on one of the Nine Worlds than being taken in by Asgard. Loki is jealous of Thor, cannot be trusted and has several tricks that are evident in the film.Loki&#8217;s ability to trick through changing his appearance is used to great effect. Hilarious scene where he changes into Captain America!The tension between Loki&#8217;s mother Frida and his brother Thor is quite intense at times and lends some realism to this fantasy tale.Odin:The All Father gets to shoot a few power blasts at the Dark Elves, gives us a closer look at the mythology of the time. Really liked that the film went more for the Asgard realm and the mythology of the time rather than staying mostly on small-town Earth.Malekith:Not a bad villain. He&#8217;s the leader of the Dark Elves, and the actor who portrays this character is trying to play it cool and subdued. But I like my villains active and energetic than subdued. My Marvel fan friends took offense on how Malekith is portrayed. But heck, it&#8217;s fiction, right? Malekith wants to collapse the Nine Worlds and after thousands of years (great back story) he makes another try at it.Jane Foster inadvertently loses the Aether, an interesting &#8220;Tesseract&#8221; of power, that some internet blogs figure might lead us to the other Marvel tales of the Infinity Gauntlet. Perhaps so. This stuff is pretty evil; I don&#8217;t understand why Jane could not have used it against the Elves but that&#8217;s fine.Romance:Yeah, a bit of that. We have a few scenes between Thor and Jane. Even between Jane&#8217;s assistant and her intern.Comedy:The director really went overboard on the comedy. I don&#8217;t mind one or two scenes to break up the seriousness of the story, but a new skit every five or ten minutes was a bit much, but I feel that&#8217;s really a matter of taste.Bottom Line:Great fight scenes, though it was disturbing to see Thor being mopped up all over the place. The overall themes of family, of betrayal and of love & honor were well-displayed. Can&#8217;t wait for the final film in the trilogy.There are two extra scenes at the credits and after the credits.

The relationship between Thor and his brother Loki was really developed and as viewers we get to see what tough choices has to be made for the greater good. Thor 2 was filled with ALOT of action. The characters and all the actors that played them were executed flawlessly and as far as where this is rated among other Marvel movies, I'd say it is the best solo movie since the first Iron Man.

Flash-forward to present-day Jane Foster (Natalie Portman, who is actually kind of annoying in this film), angry at Thor for not keeping in contact in two years, who ends up a host for The Aether when she accidentally discovers it, bringing Malekith back to Asgard to retrieve the strongest weapon in the universe when Thor learns of what's happened and tries to protect her.

Anyway though, to me Thor: The Dark World suffers from an almost complete lack of substantive character development and a plot that is mostly devoid of true drama or suspense. It's bigger than the first Thor film, but in my opinion not as good. It's really not even as dark, when you get right down to it, in spite of what the title suggests.Lack of character development? Other than Frigga and Heimdall in respectively brief scenes, The Dark World does not move anyone forward. There's plenty of Thor being Thor, Loki being Loki, etc. We've already got that much in Thor and The Avengers; this is just more of the same. There was a chance here to get personal and interesting by exploring the love triangle between Thor, Jane and Sif, but other than a brief allusion, that plot line is not touched.The villains here, The Dark Elves, are not really any different from the Frost Giants of the first film from a storytelling standpoint, and the Elves are less relatable. They fit squarely into the &#34;generic army of darkness who want to destroy everything because that's what they do&#34; trope. Epic, but mundane. And is there ever any doubt that they will be defeated? I did not find any drama there. (Marvel Studios' one key weakness so far is the ability to develop interesting villains.) The Jane Foster story arc could have been the prime source of drama, but her character is awkwardly written and strangely out-of-focus.Bottom line, The Dark World is great-looking and solid enough, but lacks a spark of freshness or drama. It's more solid than Iron Man 2, but less entertaining, and thus for me The Dark World is the most disappointing Marvel Studios film to date.

Well the movie was great!way better than the first thor, miles ahead from the disappointing Iron Man 3 (worst Iron Man), and maybe, the best superhero movie of the year as it is very close to awesomeness  with Superman and Wolverine.---Strong Points---The acting is superb. From the main characters (Loki is so unbelievably good)to even the smallest characters, each one adds so well to the movie (Russo was fantastic too!). Of course the script helps the actors but they elevate their characters so much.. Portman was good (from being bad in the first Thor), Elba was great, thor was ...thor and Hopkins is of course on the top league. Loki gives the best performance of his life and I wish I saw this actor on a play or something on Broadway (snt far from Worcester!). That being sad the only superhero movie that could surpass this one in terms of good actors both in quantity and quality would probably be the upcoming x-men. If the script helps them that much as here.There is action far more than the first movie and there is sci fi. If Superman was 35% scifi this one is 80% sci fi but that is something good than bad...the rest of the 20% is magic!!Story is good, good villains....5 out of 5 stars---Negative points---There is no need to try and find negative points here...Its a super hero movie, its gonna have flaws but nothing important really.

1566860,A26MJME9IBNETY,B008JFUS0U,StrangePegs,"[5, 9]","Marvel is re-creating what they did to create The Avengers, right now, with their Infinity Stones sub-plot. It's just introducing a piece at a time as they build up to something bigger. In The Avengers, we got our first view of Thanos and his attempt to take control of the Tesseract, which, in The Dark World, is revealed to be one of the six Infinity Stones, artifacts predating the origins of the universe. And, also on The Dark World, Malekith is after the Aether which is another of these ""stones"" although it actually takes on a fluid form.This all sounds like it's leading up to an Infinity Gauntlet kind of scenario, which would be pretty darn cool and pretty darn cosmic. The fact that Guardians of the Galaxy is coming out next year only strengthens the case for all of this. I would expect another of the Infinity Stones to show up in that one.Of course, none of that actually relates to whether Thor: The Dark World is any good in and of itself.Actually, Thor 2 is better than Thor. This one just seemed more ""Thor"" than the first one, although I don't have a good reason for feeling that way because there was an awful lot of Thor-ness about the first one, too. Maybe, it was just that this one flowed more smoothly whereas the first one definitely seemed to have its ""Earth"" parts and its ""Asgard"" parts as separate things. If you're doing Thor as Thor (not Thor trapped in the body of a mortal), he definitely needs to have the full range of being Thor.And there were a lot of cool moves with Mjolnir in this one, things like Thor leaping off of balconies as the hammer came whizzing over the building and into his hand. They definitely did their best to show the connection between Thor and the hammer.The acting was great, even Christopher Eccleston, whom I'm not particularly fond of as an actor (Doctor or not). His range seems to be quite small, but his role as Malekith was a good fit as it didn't require a lot of emotion and even less facial expression. Zachary Levi also did a pretty good job as Fandral, although, as partial as I am to Chuck, I think he didn't quite fill out Josh Dallas' shoes. There was just some ineffable quality about Dallas that made him more Fandral. Portman, also, seemed to wear the role of Jane Foster much more easily in this one, so that was nice.The thing that really made the movie work, though, was the chemistry between Hemsworth and Hiddleston. Even when not onscreen together, they pulled off the roles of warring brothers perfectly. The sibling rivalry was perfect. There's this one moment where Thor is about to hit Loki (hey, it's not really a spoiler, okay (well, kind of, but, well, deal with it)) and Thor pulls away saying, ""Mother wouldn't want us to fight,"" and Loki smiles and says, ""But she wouldn't be shocked."" The relationship is perfect.The movie also has a bit more humor in it than the last Thor, and it's not all at the expense of Darcy this time, though she does have her moments. The only real negative I'd say the movie has is that the humor breaks the tension a little too much every so often. But those are only minor bumps on the road and barely memorable once past them. It does pull you right back in.Overall, the movie has an epic feel to it that seems appropriate to a story about gods, and it does it while keeping the movie personal. That all by itself is quite an accomplishment. So, yeah, I think Thor 2 is a step above the first one, something that's not all  that common with a sequel. It doesn't make it up to the level of the first Iron Man or Captain America movies, but it does surpass both of the Iron Man sequels.

1566861,A2KVUYPLEW4LXT,B008JFUS0U,"Strategos ""The Guardian of Time""","[6, 10]","Thor was a film I had wanted to see in the theater, but couldn't get anyone to watch with me. When I did finally see it on DVD, I was actually shocked how good a film it was. Deep characterization, loads of charm, and a wonderful warmth pervaded the film (in addition to some glorious eye candy). Since then a few of the Marvel films have seems to a mis-step here and there. While I enjoyed Iron Man 3, it had neither the dramatic weight of the first Iron Man, nor the pure silly fun of Iron Man 2. And the Avengers film, while also mildly enjoyable simple wasn't up to the standards of films like Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor (I won't list reasons why because my balanced review listing positives and negatives got so much negative hateful feedback I had to pull it). And thus it was that late at night I sat down for Thor:The Dark World, half expecting a deep disappointment and half hoping for a film as good as the original. What I actually saw I never could have seen coming.The Second Best Film of the YearOkay, this has been a very interesting year. Between an Andrew Niccol film (The Host), and a Joseph Kosinski visual masterpiece (Oblivion), early on it seemed like nothing could top those two movies for sheer film-making technique. Some people hated the cheesy romance of The Host and should thus avoid Hitchcock romances, and some didn't like Oblivion, because some people just hate sci-fi for whatever reason. Still.. those films were darn good. Then we got White House Down, a masterpiece of Die Hard-style popcorn throwing fun, and Pacific Rim, which is my favorite film of the year (not the best, but it feels so good to watch it has to be my favorite). And just when I thought nothing could ever top Oblivion and the year was all done, Gravity absolutely astounded me with its quality of film-making, rocketing past Oblivion to become the best film of the year. While Thor 2 (what I'll call it for short) isn't better than Gravity, it is definitely the greatest blockbuster film of the year by a long, long way. And here's why.Simple TechniqueAnyone who has read my other reviews for movies should know by now that I am not impressed by hype for the most part. And what other people think of a film couldn't affect my opinion less. But what does impress me is good old-fashioned film-making technique. Were the actors in-character? Was the dialog entertaining and well written? Were the special effects good (and pretty)? Was the music rousing and in-sync with the action? Was there light and color and inspiring moments? And most importantly to me, was there some gosh-darn honest-to-goodness cinematography to be found?Yes. Yes! Yes!!!!!!!!I can see someone hating this film for exactly three reasons. 1. They hate the actors. 2. They hate Thor or comic books/sci-fi/blockbusters in general. 3. They have absolutely no taste whatsoever.As often happens when watching movies, watching this film I was reminded of many scenes in other films. Throne-room scenes, scenes of betrayal, romantic moments, awkward moments, funeral scenes, sci-fi action scenes. You could say that these scenes were just cheap rip-offs of other TV shows, books, and movies. But saying that would make you an idiot. Because every single one of those scenes was not just well done. It was perfectly done. The dramatic scenes will hit you hard. The romantic scenes will make you smile. The awkward scenes will make you laugh. The action scenes will glue your eyes to the screen. And the many, many scenes that just add character development to the film, layers to the story, and glorious, glorious beauty to the film will draw you in, hold your attention, and leave you in simple child-like wonder.What great film direction looks likeI don't want to knock Ender's Game too much (I already did that in my review) but the biggest failing of that film (which indicated poor direction to me) was that it was poorly paced, spending far too much time on insignificant details and not enough time on important ones. Characters felt shallow and scenes lacked dramatic weight as a result. Likewise, the climax of Man of Steel had no dramatic weight because when you've seen an hour and half of people blasting through buildings doing it one more time (this time with feeling!!!) for a climax leaves you with a major case of burn-out.Watching Thor 2, it does everything right that those films did wrong. Its pacing is perfect. It take its time when it's important, letting us catch our breath and absorb developments, and it rushes past things that don't really add weight to the story. Things which everyone knew would add more to the film (more Loki! more of the gate-keeper guardian!) were added, but actually given a reason to be there instead of just being empty fan-service. When the climax of the film does come, it's everything a film climax should be. It's filled with action, drama, wit, and hilarity. It's superbly directed, and absolutely perfect.A round of applause all-aroundEveryone, I and do mean everyone...who worked on this film deserves a round of applause. Every actor out-did themselves and surpassed their previous work as their beloved characters. The musical score is fantastic and the composer deserves serious props. The writers gave every character incredible dialog that fit and enhanced their persona even further (no out-of-character dialog to be found). The special effects are everything that Man of Steel and Avengers strove for and lacked, being strikingly surreal, and touchingly beautiful. And the cinematography is master class. The shot composition on this film is so good that I wholeheartedly believe it should be nominated (though I sure it won't be) alongside Gravity, Oblivion, and The Host.As a film-lover, what more can I say? This it the perfect comic book sci-fi sequel. See it in the theater. Buy the Blu Ray.

1566890,ALJLONJXLA3OQ,B008JFUS0U,The People's Critic,"[3, 4]","Since this film is somewhat ridiculous, I have decided to write with a less than professional tone (See my Gangster Squad review for a similar example).  Warning, sarcasm ahead.Marvel Studio&#8217;s onslaught of high-octane entertainment continues with this year&#8217;s Thor: The Dark World.  Things may have quieted down on Earth after the Battle of New York, featured in 2012&#8217;s The Avengers, but the same can not be said about Asgard.  It turns out that the evil dark elves, along with their leader, Malekith have been awaiting an opportunity to strike.  What do they want to strike and when do they want to strike it?  Well, it turns out the dark elves hate the light and they want to cast the universe in darkness.  A perfect opportunity arises when the 9 realms of the universe align, a convergence that only happens every 5000 years causing gravitational abnormalities and bringing about the Yang-Mills anomaly that could open crossroads to universe intersections like the nexus of all reality or, in the case of this film, a fault that starts a cosmic eclipse linking the dark elves&#8217; realm, Svartalfheim, to Earth!So, the stakes are high.The aforementioned cosmic eclipse happens to open right in cutie-pie, scientist, Jane Foster&#8217;s (Natalie Portman) backyard.  This causes Thor (Chris Hemsworth) to reunite with Foster for the first time in two years.  While Foster feels a bit burned by the length of time her supposed love&#8217;s been away, it doesn&#8217;t stop her from joining him on a spur of the moment jaunt to Asgard in the hopes that she can aid the Asgardians in their fight against the dark elves.Now, don&#8217;t get me wrong, I did enjoy Thor: The Dark World, but the fact that I had to write a sentence that included dark elves, Norse realms, convergence, nexus, and cosmic eclipses lets you know that we&#8217;re dealing with a film that will not be everybody&#8217;s cup of &#8220;mead.&#8221;  Nonetheless, Marvel knows their core audience, and it seems that the Thor franchise is aimed directly at them (or us).  However, if you are not a &#8220;Thor&#8221; fan and are looking for a reason to see this film, you need look no further than Tom Hiddleston as Loki.  Hiddleston steals every scene he&#8217;s in and since it&#8217;s public knowledge that he will not appear I the sequel to The Avengers, Thor: The Dark World is your one-stop-shop to get your Loki fix.The original definition of a &#8220;B movie,&#8221; is a low-budget commercial film that is in some way inferior to major releases.  Thor: The Dark World does not fit this description entirely, but it has the feel.  It is a somewhat ridiculous film, but once it gets rolling, it is a lot of fun, especially the last 30 minutes.

1566901,A3DZCNEU21MB6L,B008JFUS0U,"THowerton ""SHowT""","[2, 2]","Don't get me wrong.  I loved the first Thor and recognize that the Marvel movies on a whole are a cut above.  So what happened with &#34;The Dark World&#34;?In this cinematic installment we are treated to a more brooding thunder god as he concerns himself with Asgard and its politics.  Loki is being kept in the proverbial Asgardian gulag for his crimes against Asgard and humanity and here is a morose reflection of the trickster god presented in the first &#34;Thor&#34; and in &#34;The Avengers&#34;.  But Earth is never far from Thor's mind, nor is his love Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), who has the stupidest of luck (or is it contrivance?) when she manages to uncover the Aether, an ancient source of incredible power.  The resuscitation of the Aether reawakens an old all but forgotten Asgardian enemy, the Dark Elves who seek the destruction of the universe by depriving it of its sources of light, and led by Malekith (Christopher Eccleston; think Destro off of the first &#34;G.I. Joe&#34;).  Malekith goes after the Aether, now inhabiting Jane Foster, and leads an improbable surprise attack on Asgard that leaves Thor to do battle in a space portal jumping sequence between Earth and another alien world.  Thor vanquishes his foe with Loki's help, with Loki's mind never far from the throne of Asgard.There are big moments in T:TDW and I won't spoil them but they certainly have some far-reaching ramifications for the third film but...but for those who really enjoyed the first &#34;Thor&#34;, especially interested in the family dynamics and enjoying the fish-out-of-water storyline, I think that they will find that there are paler shades of these elements in the sequel and that they aren't nearly as satisfying.  We get to see more of Asgard, more of the royal court, but this seems less Shakesperian (a strong suit with former director Branagh) in tone and simply heavier-handed in how it all plays out.  We get the fish-out-of-water element not with Thor on Earth for the first time but with Foster on Asgard for the first time but we don't get any satisfying sense of her wonder, or her being awestruck, that would make for her being the movie patron's eyes and ears to a new experience.  The visual tone of the film is dark, and a bit messy, which I suppose fits with the title of the movie but doesn't make for an enjoyable viewing experience.  And Tom Hiddleston's excellent portrayals of the god of mischief Loki are largely wasted (though I admit more dramatic) here.  There are punctuated places of humor but they are merely cheap laughs instead of deep and lasting smiles like the other Marvel movies have managed to supply.  At least they brought Kurse in but where was the big knock down drag out fight between he and Thor?  Their conflicts were all too brief.I realize that I am complaining that Marvel didn't follow a formula that they've set up and I know that they need to try new things in order to keep a vitality, a freshness, and a willingness on the audience's part to keep coming back to characters that they're being asked to invest in.  It seems to me that Marvel tried to give us this in the tone of the movie while still following very similar plot structures to the first feature, and it falls somewhat flat.  I'm glad that they're trying.  I like these Asgardian characters and, quite honestly, I want to see more of them in Asgard and in the other nine realms and not so much adhering to Earth.Oh.

1566903,A3LDFTSXU3UPBO,B008JFUS0U,Tim &#34;Timdiana&#34; Dunn,"[4, 9]","The Avengers have taken the movie world by storm; but aside from Iron Man, if there has been any character that has made big impression on silver screen, it would be The God of Thunder: Thor. Whether you enjoy the interpretation, or just like Tom Hiddleston's Loki, the fact is that Thor has become a must see hero on screen. The character's journey began in the summer of 2011 and now the Thunderer's adventures continues in Thor: The Dark World. Directed by Alan Taylor, The Dark World brings Marvel's Phase 2 to the Holiday Season;which is a new step for the studio. Business standpoints aside, is the next chapter of Thor worthy of not just the The Mighty Avenger, but Marvel Studios?The Dark World continues the tale of Thor (Chris Hemsworth). Since the destruction of Bifrost, The God of Thunder has been restoring order to the nine realms while missing his mortal love interest Jane Foster (Natalie Portman). However when Jane discovers a power called the Aether, Thor takes her to Asgard. Just as things get more puzzling, the ancient Dark Elves awaken and attack the Asgardians. To stop the Dark Elves' leader Malekith (Christopher Eccelstein) and protect Jane, Thor must do the unthinkable and make an unlikely ally: his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston)I found The Dark World's story to be straightforward. This is cased example of what you see is what you get. Unfortunately, that was a problem. I wanted to see more from this story. There was bigger then life adventure just waiting to be explored in this film, but it never took off. Yet just because story wasn't perfect, doesn't mean it's a bad plot. The story is easy to get into and it does build itself up. The Dark World indeed has a cinematic tale; but a subplot or two would not have hurt anything.If there was one thing I could count on, it was the character. The 2011 film gave us two strong characters out of Thor and Loki, so I could only hope for the best in this new film. It is safe to say that both Thor and Loki are established characters; which made it difficult for two to develop any further. Despite that, Hemsworth and Hiddleston continue to impress as the Asgardian pair. Unfortunately I can't say the same for everyone else. At the very least, every character had something to do in this sequel; but I was really hoping for some development. For example, Lady Sif (Jaime Alexander) look as if she was going to receive a prominent importance in this film; but her time never came. This also goes for the film's villain: Malekith. Marvel has been good with their villains, but as a character, Malekith did not go anywhere. He was threatening and nothing more. Then again, if you know his source material, there was not much to work with. The character development could have been better, but the overall performances were good; which saves this element.Thor: The Dark World continues a trend of Marvel films by being technically flawless. The visuals are a sight to be hold. I was impressed seeing how Alan Taylor's direction in the likes of Asgard differ from Kenneth Branagh. I felt that Alan Taylor explored the ideas created in Thor by furthering the blend of mysticism and science fiction. Along with great visuals came the stunning action. The sequences were another great edition to the Marvel Universe by combining practicality and special effects.The Dark World had a number of good scenes. To no surprise, one of these moments deals with Thor and Loki together. However, the scene that really stood out was the final battle between Thor and Malekith. Marvel is getting good at making their fights stand out, and this fight was no different. It captures the idea of how these godly characters wood duel, and it did it in a unique fashion.As the storm begins to settle, it appears that Thor:The Dark World is not as strong as the other Marvel films. There was so much potential in this film to be great; but instead what we got was just a good film. I find that The Dark World is a bridging sequel. This is a kind a film that will help us get from Thor to Thor 3. So there is a point to this movie. Aside from that, the movie was solid enough.

As I had not made it to the theatre to see it, I did not realize that it was not filmed in 3D.  I generally try to read up on 3D movie releases to see if a movie is real 3D or if it has been converted.  If converted, I do not buy it in 3D.  With this movie, it did not enter my mind that it was not filmed in 3D, so I am extremely disappointed with this movie because of its having been converted.I love the 3D effects in Green Lantern, Avatar, Mysterious Island, and Journey to the Center of the Earth, plus a few others.  This movie shows some depth and some small amount of 3D effects, but nothing jumps off the screen at you as they do in the real 3D movies.  Quite a let down.As for the movie itself, I enjoyed it quite a bit.  Really enjoyed all the characters and the story.  The balance of humor, drama, and action is quite good.  Really no complaints about the movie.  Would recommend the Blu-ray version of this movie to anyone who enjoys these characters and/or science fiction/fantasy.  However, if you are interested in good 3D, skip this 3D converted version.I am going to knock off a couple of stars just because the movie was not filmed in 3D.

1566912,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B008JFUS0U,Todd Smith,"[1, 1]","It's no secret that I've always hated superhero movies. I find them to be cliche, over the top, and so far from reality, that often time the stories are just the lowest form of Science Fiction. The only movies of the superhero genre that I've ever truly enjoyed are the recent Batman trilogy and some of the recent Marvel films. That being said, I hated the first Thor film, because it came directly from a comic book and lacked any kind of background story whatsoever. Thanks in part to the Avengers and the development of the Loki character, that all changes with the second film. The story isn't directly from a comic book, but rather based on one. In this film, the characters are more established and there is a lengthy background story that only enhances the film, and the series. In the second film, Thor is tasked with stopping a deadly weapon, possessed by an all but extinct species. This weapon has the power to destroy the entire universe and as always, the focal point is on Earth. Unable to stop the weapon and save his girlfriend at the same time, Thor turns to an unlikely source for help, his now imprisoned brother, Loki. Given the magnitude of the story and the power of the enemy, I'm a bit surprised that they didn't keep this film to be used as an Avengers sequel, as it has all the makings of an epic sequel. Chris Hemsworth reprises his role as Thor and this time he is beyond terrific. His role in the Avengers really enhanced the popularity of a character that most people were unfamiliar with, and the tremendous start to the film really set the framework for Hemsworth to take Thor to the next level. Even the supporting cast steps it up a notch as Natalie Portman is more used to the idea of a boyfriend from another world and being involved in things she couldn't possibly understand. Finally, Tom Hiddleston tops of the story, with his portrayal of Loki. I may be going out on a limb here, but I thought Hiddleston was even better in The Dark World than he was in The Avengers. Going into the Avengers, next to The Hulk, Thor was the weakest of the introduction films, and the least known and appreciated character. That all changed with the Avengers and in his second film, the Thor character steps up to a level that rivals even Iron Man. If you're not that into the series and have only selectively seen a few of the films, make sure you include the Dark World, as it is essential to fully understanding Thor and his impact in the future of the series.",4,The Ultimate Movie Review! - (...) - @tss5078,1402185600,"06 8, 2014",2014,2486,"['secret', ""'ve"", 'always', 'hated', 'superhero', 'movies', 'find', 'be', 'cliche', 'top', 'so', 'far', 'reality', 'often', 'time', 'stories', 'are', 'just', 'lowest', 'form', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'only', 'movies', 'superhero', 'genre', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'truly', 'enjoyed', 'are', 'recent', 'Batman', 'trilogy', 'recent', 'Marvel', 'films', 'being', 'said', 'hated', 'first', 'Thor', 'film', 'came', 'directly', 'comic', 'book', 'lacked', 'kind', 'background', 'story', 'whatsoever', 'Thanks', 'part', 'Avengers', 'development', 'Loki', 'character', 'changes', 'second', 'film', 'story', ""n't"", 'directly', 'comic', 'book', 'rather', 'based', 'one', 'film', 'characters', 'are', 'more', 'established', 'lengthy', 'background', 'story', 'only', 'film', 'series', 'second', 'film', 'Thor', 'tasked', 'stopping', 'deadly', 'weapon', 'possessed', 'extinct', 'species', 'weapon', 'power', 'destroy', 'entire', 'universe', 'always', 'focal', 'point', 'Earth', 'Unable', 'stop', 'weapon', 'save', 'girlfriend', 'same', 'time', 'Thor', 'unlikely', 'source', 'help', 'now', 'imprisoned', 'brother', 'Loki', 'Given', 'magnitude', 'story', 'power', 'enemy', ""'m"", 'bit', 'surprised', 'did', ""n't"", 'keep', 'film', 'be', 'used', 'Avengers', 'sequel', 'makings', 'epic', 'sequel', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'role', 'Thor', 'time', 'terrific', 'role', 'Avengers', 'really', 'enhanced', 'popularity', 'character', 'most', 'people', 'were', 'unfamiliar', 'tremendous', 'start', 'film', 'really', 'set', 'framework', 'Hemsworth', 'take', 'Thor', 'next', 'level', 'Even', 'supporting', 'cast', 'steps', 'up', 'notch', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'more', 'used', 'idea', 'boyfriend', 'world', 'being', 'involved', 'things', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'understand', 'Finally', 'Tom', 'Hiddleston', 'tops', 'story', 'portrayal', 'Loki', 'may', 'be', 'going', 'limb', 'here', 'thought', 'Hiddleston', 'was', 'even', 'better', 'Dark', 'World', 'was', 'Avengers', 'Going', 'Avengers', 'next', 'Hulk', 'Thor', 'was', 'weakest', 'introduction', 'films', 'least', 'known', 'appreciated', 'character', 'changed', 'Avengers', 'second', 'film', 'Thor', 'character', 'up', 'level', 'even', 'Iron', 'Man', ""'re"", 'not', 'series', 'have', 'only', 'selectively', 'seen', 'few', 'films', 'make', 'sure', 'include', 'Dark', 'World', 'essential', 'fully', 'understanding', 'Thor', 'impact', 'future', 'series']",N/A
1566913,A2YKADCJME4FSW,B008JFUS0U,Tom Birkenstock,"[3, 5]","Of all the superheroes who have made the leap from page to screen, Thor has been the biggest surprise, if only because he breaks so clearly from the most well established superhero narratives.  The most common blueprint for the superhero film finds an altruistic young man struggling with doing the right thing only to be given extraordinary powers that change his life and the world around him (see Spider Man and Captain America).  This narrative nicely fits within the hero&#8217;s journey narrative Hollywood has loved at least since Star Wars.  And then there&#8217;s the popular superhero narrative of a billionaire deciding to give himself to his community by mustering his extraordinary talents and wealth (see Batman and Iron Man).  The advantage of this kind of story is that the hero&#8217;s astounding wealth can ground the events in a world that looks a lot like our own, minimizing the audience&#8217;s suspension of disbelief.  But the world of Thor is a strange amalgamation of superheroes, mythology, fantasy, and science fiction.  In short, it is a bizarre hodgepodge of influences that only seem to fit together within the logic of comic books.And yet somehow the first Thor film worked.  A lot of the credit goes to Kenneth Branagh who embraced the loopier aspect of the hero, but still managed to ground the narrative with a combination of mythological family drama and a 1980s fish out of water comedy.  Despite the first film&#8217;s laborious finale, the movie succeeded on the merits of everyone involved.  The sequel, Thor: The Dark World, continues to expand on Thor&#8217;s universe, spending more time off earth and in the various Nine Realms.Thor: The Dark World opens once again with that ponderous signifier of the fantasy genre: the voiceover.  (I understand how this might be necessary in some situations, especially with the overwhelmingly large universe of J.R.R. Tolkein, but there has got to be a better way to build a fantasy world in the medium of film).  Odin&#8217;s voiceover introduces Malekith, the film&#8217;s villain who hopes to destroy the universe using a powerful weapon known as the Aether, a maroon sometimes liquid, sometimes solid object that also appears to have a mind of its own.  Malekith&#8217;s plans are stymied by Bor, Thor&#8217;s grandfather.  But he wakes thousands of years later, at a time when the Nine Realms are in alignment, which, lucky for Malekith, is apparently the ideal time for their destruction. This Convergence has shred the boundaries between worlds, which leads Thor love interest and scientific expert in technobabble, Jane Foster to become infected by the Aether.Malekith isn&#8217;t a particularly compelling villain.  His motivations are murky at best, and it&#8217;s clear that his sole job is to move the plot forward.  But luckily the much more compelling villain from the first film and The Avengers, Loki, has also returned.  For the first part of the film, Loki remains locked up on Asgard for his crimes, and he only gets released when Thor decides he needs his help to hunt down Malekith.  At this point it&#8217;s hard to imagine a Thor film without Loki.  His charismatic trickster has become the kind of villain you hate yourself for actually rooting for.  Likewise, Chris Hemsworth excels at being unselfconsciously charming as Thor, and Anthony Hopkins manages to be both grizzled and regal as Odin.But if there is one aspect of The Dark War that compares unfavorably with its predecessor, it&#8217;s a fumbling of the Thor, Loki, and Odin dynamic.  Kenneth Branagh at first seemed like an odd choice for a superhero film, but watching the first film, it became clear that Branagh&#8217;s knowledge of Shakespeare made him ideal to explore the relationship between a family of royals (I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m not the only person to recognize parallels between Thor and Prince Hal/Henry V).  This is most evident in the character of Odin.  In the first film, Branagh and Hopkins crafted a complex image of a king who excelled at war and yet hated violence, who loved his sons and yet feared for their future.  When Odin banishes Thor, Hopkins plays the character as stern but melancholy.  In the sequel, Hopkins is given little to do but to stomp around being gruff.But in general perhaps the biggest asset the Thor films have is a cast intent on ignoring how downright goofy, if fun, the material is and giving performances that craft as fully realized characters as possible, even if their screen time is scant.  Ray Stevenson, Jaimie Alexander, Tadanobu Asano, and Zachary Levi (replacing Josh Dallas) all manage to make the most of their archetypal adventurers even while relegated to the periphery.  Each character could potentially anchor an entire film, so long as they also had a comic book named after them.  As for the earthlings, Stellan Skarsgard turns in a more comedic performance this time around, and Kat Denning manages to barely skirt annoying and manages to be funny.  The Thor films have enough characters to fuel five more movies without relying on the larger Marvel universe.The Dark World is directed by Alan Taylor who has worked primarily in television, most relevantly directing a number of episodes of Game of Thrones.  His biggest contribution to the Nine Realms is providing a more lived in feel to Asgard and a heavy infusion of sci-fi elements.  Branagh embraced the comic book origins, making liberal use of Dutch tilts and bright colors.  And while these are taken directly from the art of Thor co-creator Jack Kirby, Taylor&#8217;s slightly grimier vision works better on the big screen. Taylor seems heavily influenced by George Lucas circa 1977 to 1983.  Not only does he create a world with a little dirt and grime, but he also melds science fiction with fantasy.  The races of the Nine Realms are just as comfortable battling with sword and shield as they are space fighters.  This goes a long way towards really showcasing what a strange, baroque world Stan Lee and Jack Kirby have created, but grounding it for the film going audience.The Dark World is a case of one step forward and one step back.  Unlike in the first film, the plot moves along lithely, but in order to do so it has abandoned the psychological depth that differentiated the first film from other superhero movies.  But when this superhero craze started a few years ago, no one really expected a Thor film in the first place.  Asgard and the Nine Realms seemed so loopy, so melded to the page that a film seemed impossible.  Comic books have the potential to present an image of unfettered imagination at work.  The Thor films have shown that, despite the odds, this can translate to the screen.",4,Another Winner from Marvel,1385683200,"11 29, 2013",2013,6705,"['superheroes', 'who', 'have', 'made', 'leap',

Maybe they were different for a reason.&#34; Two Years after saving New Mexico, Thor (Hemsworth) still thinks often of Jane (Portman) and vice versa.

Having no other choice they all must unite with the enemy they most despise in order to save everything and everyone. As many of you know by now I am not a huge comic book movie fan. I will say that of the entire Avengers saga the first Thor was my favorite movie. Due to that I had pretty high expectations for this one. I won't say I was disappointed because I did like it but I didn't think it was as good as the first one. They can only do the superhero saving Earth story so many times so with this one they added the threat to Thor's home world as well. Most of the movie takes place on Asgard so that aspect was nice and it did have a fair amount of comedy to keep it entertaining all the way through. There was just something missing in this one that the first one had. I don't know if it was because my expectations for this one were much higher then the original but I didn't have the same enjoyment from this one the other had. All that said though this is a good movie and worth watching, especially to continue the complete story of the saga. Overall, good movie but I didn't think it was as good as first one.

While it is not a perfect sequel, it is definitely a step up from Iron Man 3.In this film we see the aftermath of what The Avengers film has labeled 'New York' (The battle of New York) as Loki is imprisoned. At the same time the Thor mythos is expanded for fans of the film who had never read the comic books . The fans are introduced to Malaketh and the dark elves and a lot more character development with characters such as Odin Frigga and the Warriors Three. There is also an expansion on the love story between Thor and Jane, and if there is one thing that the Marvel films have done well it is the importance of romance. Once again, like the first, the story is driven by comedy with great one liners and a few very well executed surprises. This film however, is by no means perfect as the major failure is the a weak development on Malaketh. The acting choice is wise, but there is no story behind him and a villainous persona that holds no candle compared to Loki and because of that, you pretty much come into this film knowing that Thor is going to win and story is going to continue on. Yet in this film what makes it all worth while is the scene in between the credits, as the bigger and better story finally sheds a little of the mystery as well as an introduction to a very unusual character in the Marvel Universe.Will there be a Thor 3, who knows.

It has also stayed pretty true to the Marvel comics edition of Thor.

1566934,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B008JFUS0U,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[19, 47]","I know that I'm going against the trend of rave reviews here, but if I'm going to be honest, I was really disappointed by Thor: The Dark World.  For all its eye-popping CGI and grand cosmic scale, the film really seems to alternate between constant unrelenting exposition for the first half and then going to the opposite extreme with bewildering jumping about that frequently seems to generate more heat than light, especially when it comes to understanding what's supposed to be happening (other than the most basic 'good guys trying to stop bad guys from destroying the universe' anyway).It's not the fault of the actors. Chris Hemsworth delivers once in fine form once again as Thor. And Tom Hiddleston's Loki... what can I say?  Tom Hiddleston _is_ a god, stealing every scene he's in. Let Asgard and Earth fall! It'd be worth it just to get to watch Hiddleston's Loki gloat over it. Idris Elba's Heimdall once again lends some much needed somber gravitas to the scenes he's in, but it's Zachary Levi's Fandral who really brings on the Errol Flynn/Douglas Fairbanks panache of Asgard being a place where the Norse gods lived for the sheer joy of a good fight. I just wish they had him in more scenes, along with Jaimie Alexander's warrior goddess Sif who kicks her fair share of ass, holding her own with Thor on the battlefield in the all-too-brief scenes she's in. Kat Dennings as Jane's intern Darcy Lewis again brings perky comic relief, teamed this time with her own hapless and much put-upon sub-intern, Jonathan Howard's Ian, to great effect.On the disappointing side though, Ray Stevenson - an actor whose work I generally love - is once again completely wasted as Volstagg, because the script gives him little to say and even less to do and makes no attempt at all to bring out the character's grand Falstaffian humor. But it's Natalie Portman - an actress again whom I generally love - whose Jane Foster unfortunately creates the biggest drag on the acting side. Aside from the serious problem that the plot renders her a passive pawn for almost the entire film and the script leaves her only banal dialogue to work with, there's simply no chemistry between her and Hemsworth's Thor. None, nada, zip.  Which makes all of Thor's motivation for her being the great love of his existence all seem rather fake and flat. This is made all the more painfully clear by the scenes between Thor and Sif where, if only briefly, you see some real man/woman feeling on display. Hell, even Darcy and Ian, the interns, have more chemistry going than Thor and Jane.There's no real point in trying to explain the plot beyond 'dark elves want to destroy the realms and Thor must stop them to save not only the realms but his one great love'. Partly because it's going to be explained to you from the minute the film starts. And then explained some more by various characters explaining things to each other. And then explained yet some more, in case you somehow missed out on the first three lumps of exposition.  In point of fact, most of the first half of the film consists of characters constantly explaining things. Unfortunately, none of this ends up mattering because no amount of explaining can make any real sense of what's happening in the film, let alone make you care about it. The more they explain, the less you want to hear.  Basically, just think ""midi-chlorians"" from Star Wars. Yeah, it's like that.The CGI is fantastic and eye-catching, but after a while you start to feel awash in it, particularly when it starts to get in the way of understanding what's happening. And in the way of seeing more of Tom Hiddleston's Loki. He really is the best thing in the movie, bringing it to full life when he's on the screen and letting it sink back into meaningless tedium when he's not. The man can do more with an ever-so-slight smirk or a wounded puppy-dog look than most actors can do with a full page of Oscar-worthy dialogue.One minor thing that I found rather distracting - though it may have been just me - was that the armor and helmets the dark elf foot soldiers were wearing in the big battle scenes seemed way too reminiscent of the look of the Cybermen from the older Doctor Who incarnations.  I kept expecting the Tardis to sudden materialize in the middle of the battle.A couple of final notes. As always, Stan Lee has a cameo you can watch for.  And there are two end-credits scenes to catch, the first particularly intriguing as it not only suggests what might be coming next, it introduces a new character played by a very well-known and talented actor you'll probably recognize.In the end, except for the humorous bits and the chance to see Tom Hiddleston doing Loki once again, not really recommended for anyone but die-hard fans of the first Thor film.",2,A minority review of Thor: The Endless Exposition,1384214400,"11 12, 2013",2013,4778,"['know', ""'m"", 'going', 'trend', 'rave', 'reviews', 'here', ""'m"", 'going', 'be', 'honest',

Idris Elba is back and has some cool moves, they also give him some dialog with his helmet off.  Many funny moments.  Anthony Hopkins and Tom Hiddleston are great as always.  I thought that Asgaard's ""steampunk"" looking air defense and air force was very cool.  The enemy's collapsing field grenades were different.  My one complaint about this episode - without giving away too much -- is that the emotional investment and sense of loss in tragedy is greatly diminshed when the movie studio / writers resurrect a character from what was presented and witnessed in a scene (i.e. what you are lead to believe) as certain death... by using sleight-of-hand plot tricks.  For those who remember that far back this was the problem with Star Trek II (Wrath of Khan).

1566949,A24JDJQWQDDH14,B008JFUS0U,Yu Narukami,"[2, 6]","Now that we're firmly into Phase Two of Marvel's plan for total cinema domination, the titles are coming thick and fast.The next Captain America will be along in the spring, and in a year that's already brought the terrific Iron Man 3 we now have this sequel to Thor, a movie that was bright, funny and carried along with a real zip by director Kenneth Branagh. This first return to that world doesn't quite measure up, thanks to some uninspired storytelling, but it's still a breezy and fun couple of hours.After the events of Avengers Assemble, Norse god Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is busy keeping peace across the realms. Since almost all the necessary introductions were made first time round, we can get straight to it, something that also allows characters slightly down the cast list to get their moment to shine.The main bit of setup required is a prologue that goes all Lord of the Rings on us, as we learn about the Dark Elves led by Malekith (Christopher Eccleston). He's after some cosmic goo called the Aether, which will allow him to get up to no good when the nine realms align for the first time in 5000 years, something called the Convergence.Back in Asgard, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) has had to answer for his crimes in Thor and Avengers Assemble, and left to rot in prison until the plot requires him. Meanwhile, on earth, Natalie Portman's scientist, Jane, is trying to adjust to life after Thor. But she gets dragged back into events when she's alerted by her colleagues about some sort of portal they've found. Through a vague and confused bit of plotting, she comes into contact with the Aether via the portal, and gets somehow infected by it.Thor brings her to Asgard in an attempt to cure her, but don't look for much sense during this stretch that also brings an attack from Malekith that makes a mockery of the supposed Asgardian defences.It's one of two or three key sequences that, while never exactly botched, just point to a lack of directorial craft and poor editing choices. For all its story, and backstory, the writing isn't the strong suit here. The big picture is often little more than gibberish, but individual scenes please and are still capable of moments of wonder.Much of what draws audiences in comes from its technical brilliance. Glorious production design is used to realise Asgard and the other worlds we visit. Then of course there's the action, generally rousing if a little repetitive at times. Thor swinging his hammer at a monstrous foe is enjoyable, but there's only so many times we can watch that before it becomes monotonous. But come the Convergence, a grand finale awaits that makes the more sluggish passages worthwhile.But the real selling point is the humour. Where the first film largely was largely comprised of Thor's fish out of water antics, this time everyone gets the opportunity for a one-liner or two, and most comedies wish they were as funny as this.It's on a modest scale compared to the Avengers, but then so is almost every movie, but Thor: The Dark World will do very nicely until the next one of those comes along.",5,Thor 2 The Dark World,1385596800,"11 28, 2013",2013,3084,"['Now', ""'re"", 'firmly', 'Phase', 'Two', 'Marvel', 'plan', 'total', 'cinema', 'domination', 'titles', 'are', 'coming', 'thick', 'fast.The', 'next', 'Captain', 'America', 'will', 'be', 'along', 'spring', 'year', 'already', 'brought', 'terrific', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'now', 'have', 'sequel', 'Thor', 'movie', 'was', 'bright', 'funny', 'carried', 'real', 'zip', 'director', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'first', 'return', 'world', ""n't"", 'quite', 'measure', 'up', 'thanks', 'uninspired', 'storytelling', 'still', 'breezy', 'fun', 'couple', 'hours.After', 'events', 'Avengers', 'Assemble', 'Norse', 'god', 'Thor', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'busy', 'keeping', 'peace', 'realms', 'almost', 'necessary', 'introductions', 'were', 'made', 'first', 'time', 'round', 'can', 'get', 'straight', 'something', 'also', 'characters', 'slightly', 'cast', 'list', 'get', 'moment', 'shine.The', 'main', 'bit', 'setup', 'required', 'prologue', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'learn', 'Dark', 'Elves', 'led', 'Malekith', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'cosmic', 'goo', 'called', 'Aether', 'will', 'allow', 'get', 'up', 'good', 'when', 'nine', 'realms', 'align', 'first', 'time', '5000', 'years', 'something', 'called', 'Convergence.Back', 'Asgard', 'Loki', 'Tom', 'Hiddleston', 'had', 'answer', 'crimes', 'Thor', 'Avengers', 'Assemble', 'left', 'rot', 'prison', 'plot', 'Meanwhile', 'earth', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'scientist', 'Jane', 'trying', 'adjust', 'life', 'Thor', 'dragged', 'back', 'events', 'when', 'alerted', 'colleagues', 'sort', 'portal', ""'ve"", 'found', 'vague', 'confused', 'bit', 'plotting', 'contact', 'Aether', 'portal', 'somehow', 'infected', 'it.Thor', 'Asgard', 'attempt', 'cure', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'much', 'sense', 'stretch', 'also', 'attack', 'Malekith', 'mockery', 'supposed', 'Asgardian', 'defences.It', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'key', 'sequences', 'never', 'exactly', 'botched', 'just', 'point', 'lack', 'directorial', 'craft', 'poor', 'editing', 'choices', 'story', 'backstory', 'writing', ""n't"", 'strong', 'suit', 'here', 'big', 'picture', 'often', 'little', 'more', 'gibberish', 'individual', 'scenes', 'please', 'are', 'still', 'capable', 'moments', 'wonder.Much', 'what', 'draws', 'audiences', 'technical', 'brilliance', 'Glorious', 'production', 'design', 'used', 'realise', 'Asgard', 'other', 'worlds', 'visit', 'Then', 'course', 'action', 'generally', 'rousing', 'little', 'repetitive', 'times', 'Thor', 'swinging', 'hammer', 'monstrous', 'foe', 'enjoyable', 'only', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'can', 'watch', 'monotonous', 'come', 'Convergence', 'grand', 'finale', 'awaits', 'more', 'sluggish', 'passages', 'worthwhile.But', 'real', 'selling', 'point', 'humour', 'Where', 'first', 'film', 'largely', 'was', 'largely', 'comprised', 'Thor', 'fish', 'water', 'antics', 'time', 'everyone', 'opportunity', 'one-liner', 'two', 'most', 'comedies', 'wish', 'were', 'as', 'funny', 'this.It', 'modest', 'scale', 'compared', 'Avengers', 'then', 'so', 'almost', 'movie', 'Thor', 'Dark', 'World', 'will', 'do', 'very', 'nicely', 'next', 'one', 'along']",N/A
1566950,A1S1BJFTA644TU,B008JFUS0U,Zalmorion the Fantastic,"[1, 1]","This movie makes the first Thor movie look like a bad memory.  It blows that one out of the water.  Easily.  In fact, I'd say this movie is more akin to the Avengers in style.  Truthfully, I'm not sure WHY Thor just didn't call upon a couple Avengers to help him.  Hulk alone would have evened the odds immediately.  But, alas, this is Thor's chance to shine.  He does.There are a lot of interesting foes Thor and his little gang have to contend with before they even meet the dark elves.  Then there is a lot of magic and science I cannot pretend to understand that makes the story a lot of fun to follow.  Loki and the dark elves keep the tension high in this movie.  There are a few nice twists and surprises, and a few startling ones.  (Stay for the scene that appears after the credits roll for a nice surprise).The creativity in this film is HIGH!  Fighting between realms of existence.  Following Thor's hammer as it tries to get back to him using various routes.  Magic transforming dark elves in hulking monsters.  Other monsters dropping into the fight.  Dogfights between ships with amazing powers and Norse designs.  Frigga kicking some serious . . . elf.  (Frigga pretty much saves the day until something intervenes.  Very nice.)  Kat Dennings comedy relief.  You get the idea--LOTS of fun to be had watching this film.Action-packed, loaded with superb effects, and boasting a top-notch supporting cast, Thor: The Dark World is visually stunning, at times funny, and thrilling all the way through.  No corny dialogue.  No waste-of-time love scenes.  Just a solid sci-fi fantasy story wrapped in Norse mythology.WATCH IT.  If you are a Marvel fan, BUY IT.
