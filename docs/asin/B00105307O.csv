I hated the fourth season because Artemis Gordon was not in a few of the episodes. When I watch them in later years as reruns, I started to enjoy them. Now in DVD I really like them. The fourth season mix of Ross Martin with guest stars because of Martin's health actually was a great mix. It allowed Robert Conrad and the script to be adjusted to the guest stars. Some of the episodes were similar to third season plus some more mysterious and suspenseful shows such as Sedgewick Curse, Bleak Island and the Plague. Another great episode Is the Night of the Fugitive where West and Gordon tackle the syndicate (Wow! in the 1870's).

Bengen,"[1, 4]",One thing to note about this seasons episodes is the occasional stylish late 60's background music blended in with the never old Wild Wild West theme music. Racial integration of more black actors in episodes can also be found during this season as well in contrast to previous seasons. The women's movement had not yet taken root at this time and only small traces in attitude changes toward women can be detected in the episodes.  The difference in the episodes produced in the first season versus this forth season reminds those of us who lived it the pronounced changes that took place in our society during those four short years.,5,Wild Wild 60's music influence,1217462400,"07 31, 2008",2008,635,"['One', 'thing', 'note', 'seasons', 'occasional', 'stylish', 'late', '60', 'background', 'music', 'blended', 'never', 'old', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West', 'theme', 'music', 'Racial', 'integration', 'more', 'black', 'actors', 'episodes', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'found', 'season', 'as', 'well', 'contrast', 'previous', 'seasons', 'women', 'movement', 'had', 'not', 'yet', 'taken', 'root', 'time', 'only', 'small', 'traces', 'attitude', 'changes', 'women', 'can', 'be', 'detected', 'episodes', 'difference', 'episodes', 'produced', 'first', 'season', 'versus', 'forth', 'season', 'who', 'lived', 'pronounced', 'changes', 'took', 'place', 'society', 'four', 'short', 'years']",The Wild Wild West: Season 4

Robert Conrad and Ross Martin return as US Secret Service agents James West and Artemus Gordon, out to save the American West of the 1870's from a variety of exotic and diabolical villains.  Actor Ross Martin suffered from health problems during the season.  His temporary replacements included William Schallart, Charles Aidman, Alan Hale Jr, and Pat Paulsen, each of whom added something positive to their episodes paired with Robert Conrad.Season Four gives no indications the show was running out of steam.  Among the highlights: The return of long-time foe Dr. Loveless in ""The Night of Miguelito's Revenge; Jim West's return to the Secret Service Training Academy to smoke out a traitor in ""The Night of the Janus""; a nicely done gloss on the Sherlock Holmes classic ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" in ""The Night of Bleak Island""; and a complicated favor for a dying criminal in ""The Night of the Sabatini Death.""The television episodes have nicely transferred to DVD format, wild fights and James Bond spoofs intact; it is hard to believe these shows first aired forty years ago.

Growing up in New York, the reruns ran aplenty during the 70s.  Sadly though, series co-star Ross Martin didn't get to appreciate the whole season as he was side lined by a heart attack.  Replacing him was a young Charles Aidman as Jeremy Pike who was as good at his trade as Arte (you get the impression he learned from the master himself) and others including Alan (the Skipper) Hale, John Dehner and William Schallert (Carson Drew, Nils Baris, Martin Lane) in a 2 part episode.  Their names got billed in the ending credits in the episodes they appeared in though Martin continued to appear in the opening credits for the remainder of the run.  Martin would recover to be able to do the sequel films made in 1979 and 1980, Wild Wild West Revisited and More Wild Wild West which according to [...] will sadly not be included in this set.  Fortunately, they are shown often enough on Encore Westerns so you can copy them yourself uncut (the prerecorded VHS tapes I believe are copy protected).  Martin passed away soon after making the sequel films, but I am sure if we looked up him up on the IMDB we would find a lot of good stuff under his name including a villain on Wonder Woman in 1977, and an attempt to bring Charlie Chan back just before or after More Wild Wild West.

In fact, the show which was shown on CBS on Friday evenings was consistently high in the Nielsens. In a reflection of the times, worried about war and questioning whether kids should have toy guns to play with the show fell to a very biased axe.The Fourth season features a few differences. In the first few episodes there is a distinct change in the background music that suggests the late sixties nightclub instead of the 1870 bar. The plots tend to revolve around eccentrics or eccentric countries trying to cause a national disaster or solve something at the expense of everyone else.The sets are incredibly more colorful than the previous season and the plot lines tend to pick up in mid performance of action, as opposed to the old days when some explosion would occur and we get to see the reasons unravel.  There is also a significant change in the supporting actors. Although the series always featured a good amount of roles for minorities, there are more in this years twenty four episodes than in any prior series.Many reviewers mention the fact that Ross Martin had a heart attack that caused him to miss many episodes in this particular season, but I remember that the general replacements of a steady Agent Pike and a host of guest stars adequately filled in while Mr. Martin was recovering. Pat Paulson, a well known comedian who became a star of the moment after his ""Laugh In"" roles was brought in as a ""special"" government agent and is among the many who perhaps are now forgotten, yet there presence here brings a moment to remember.In the end, as with many television shows of the era, the series is left hanging and just like ""Lost in Space"" with the Robinson family, we are left to wonder what happened to our heroes.

The culture of the United States continued to evolve rapidly as younger people exerted a greater influence on it.  Westerns dominated television of the 1950's, but by the end of the 1960's it was apparent that westerns had run their course, though a few westerns continued to hang on.  Most westerns contained elements that aficionados of the genre considered traditional, but the format of ""The Wild Wild West"" permitted science fiction and fantasy.The fourth season continued the formula of the preceding seasons, with a significant change due to illness.  The average episode featured at least two fight scenes, with James Tiberius West (Robert Conrad) usually winning the day.  In most episodes, Artemus Gordon (Ross Martin) would introduce a neat gadget, appear in disguise, or both.The significant change was when Ross Martin had a heart attack and missed filming of nine episodes.  Martin's position (not his role) was filled by Charles Aidman, Alan Hale, and William Schallert.  The replacements brought their own style to the show, including a bit of humor when Alan Hale's character talks about going to a desert island and a snippet of music from ""Gilligan's Island"" is played.  That particular episode also featured Jim Backus, another ""Gilligan's Island"" regular.In previous season, the general strategy was for James West to provide physical and strategic capabilities with Artemus's brains.  Because Artemus was often missing, James sometimes stepped in to fill in for Artemus's genius; sometimes the fill-ins did.  One thing that never failed in this series is West's fortuitous luck and the never-failing arrogance of the enemy.In the final 24 episodes of the series, the show managed to introduce many different elements.  One episode appeared to borrow freely from ""The Hound of the Baskervilles.""  Another episode seemed inspired by ""The Phantom of the Opera.""  Other episodes seemed inspired by spy and science fiction shows of the 1950's and 1960's.  In ""The Night of the Sedgewick Curse,"" members of the Sedgewick family experience rapid aging.  There is a scene reminiscent of the wolf man and Dr. Jekyll where a family member ages rapidly in the course of seconds.  Other episodes featured deadly germs, an apparent kraken, and a gigantic tuning fork that is able to destroy houses.  ""The Night of the Juggernaut"" featured a steam-powered tank; a bit in advance of the first non-rail, mounted armored vehicle built around 1904.The guest stars on ""The Wild Wild West"" were often entertainment industry veterans.  Comedian Harvey Korman, who was a regular on ""The Carol Burnett Show"" and was a lead character in ""Blazing Saddles,"" appeared as an enemy of the week.  Michael Dunn appeared as Dr. Miguelito Loveless, one of James West's most intelligent and creative foes, a final time.  Some of the many other guest stars, many of whom are no longer with us, were Kevin McCarthy, Pat Paulsen, Frank Campanella, Ted Knight, Sorrell Brooke, Jackie Coogan, pop singer Jackie DeShannon, who also sings on the episode, John Williams, Beverly Garland, whose last role was in ""Seventh Heaven,"" Nina Foch, Guy Stockwell, and Lana Wood.After watching the twenty-four episodes twice, and looking back on this final season, I have mixed feelings about the fourth season.  Some of the plots seem remarkably similar to plots from the first three seasons.  I wondered whether I could go through the episodes from all four seasons and find categories of plot.  The ""old dark house"" appears in quite a few episodes, with at least three, maybe more, on islands.  Megalomaniacs were frequently the enemy of the week, though they were entertaining in their variety.  I sometimes had the feeling when watching the fourth season, which I did after re-watching the first three seasons again, that perhaps the show was winding down.  The creativity and cleverness seemed a bit less than in the previous seasons.  The show appeared, to me, to be at a turning point.  Had the show been renewed, it needed to be refreshed in some way to keep viewers watching.  Yet, it was sad, bittersweet, really, watching the final episodes, knowing that something magical was going to be lost when the show was cancelled.Lobbying groups claimed there was too much violence on television, and for sure that violence was going to lead to bad things.  One of the television shows targeted as being too violent was ""The Wild Wild West.""  Watching the show forty-plus years later, the violence does not appear to me to be as bad as claimed.  Yes, there were multiple fights each week.  Yes, there were periodic gunfights and explosions.  Yet, in contrast to modern television, the show was not graphic and I consider the violence not only relatively tame, but also occasionally campy.Sadly, as with seasons two and three, there are no extras.I consider ""The Wild Wild West"" to be classic television.  The show was able to do things that most traditional westerns, and even most science fiction shows, were unable to do.  The plots were often inspired and creative.  The chemistry between Robert Conrad and Ross Martin was phenomenal and it was always entertaining to watch the pair together.  The show was frequently anachronistic, but the show turned what could have been a detriment into an advantage, playing fast and loose with history in an amusing and fun way.  Fans enjoy pointing out historical inaccuracies of the show, but they do so in the spirit of the show, which was to be entertaining.""The Wild Wild West"" was one of a kind, and is unlikely to be duplicated.  Ross Martin and Robert Conrad were a great team.  While often formulaic, the formula worked, and we tuned in every week to see the gadgets, the characters, and just what kind of mess Artie and James would get into this week.  Here is a show that I would have watched for many more seasons, had it not been cancelled.Enjoy!",4,A Bittersweet Final Season,1352505600,"11 10, 2012",2012,5971,"['fourth', 'final', 'season', 'Wild',

1124766,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B00105307O,Robert Badgley,"[22, 24]","I hadn't seen the show since it went off the air in 1969.I've bought and viewed now all four seasons.In my memories the last season was the worst of them all.If you had have asked me almost 40 years ago,my rating would barely be two stars.However,I think being able to see them 1) in good quality colour(no one I knew owned a colour set back then) and 2)and on MY time instead of a networks'(over a period of several months),it has changed my oppinion slightly.Actually seeing any TV shows on home video can't help but change the dynamic;some for the good,some for the bad.I found the positives few and far between but nonetheless they were/are there.Michael Dunn returns as everyone's favourite villain Dr.Loveless.I don't think any Wild,Wild West fan ever disliked Dunn for his performances.It is well known about Ross Martin and his health problem that resulted in him missing alot of the last season filming.It's obvious they held some shows in abeyance and ran them later instead of in shooting order because of the negative feedback they got from the public at the time about his ""stand-ins"".He was able to return for a precious few eps,but was unable to appear on the last.But every appearance he made,made you miss him all the more when he wasn't there.He was sorely missed which says alot about the man and the good actor he was.And speaking of acting it seems to me that Robert Conrad improved in that department as this season wound down.He stepped up when he had to and I thought his character was becoming more fleshed out also.He came into his own.This is in sharp contrast to earlier seasons when his good looks carried him farther than the quality of his acting and the lean scripts given him.Another positive is the marvellous stunt work by Robert Conrad and his fellow actors/stuntmen.As a bit of trivia you may or may not know,Red West  appeared in many Wild,Wild West eps as one of the actor/stuntmen.Red is well known to Elvis Presley fans as being part of Elvis' inner circle/entourage.And speaking of stunt work you get to see a stunt Robert Conrad made that went terribly awry and by the look of it could have ended his career and/or life had it gone a little differently.It shows him jumping from a landing area at the top of a long flight of stairs.He grabs onto a chandelier but looses his grip and crashes to the ground.The camera  cuts about a second after his landing and they ""covered"" the scene and went on,but it shows you how dedicated Conrad was in the making of this show.He bumped alot of heads with the shows' brass and other actors and even his co-star Martin at times.He didn't get his ""tough-guy"" image for nothing.But no one can ever say he didn't give his all during the making of this show and it's one of the reasons this show has remained a fan favourite since its' debut.On the other side of the coin there is ALOT to say.The first shot must go to the man who had the unenviable task of first stepping in for Ross Martin when he fell ill.Charles Aidman was the worst choice for Martins' part.He simply tried too hard but came up short every time.He also had a terribly annoying ""the-cat-that-ate-the-canary"" smile on his face almost all the time.Then William Schallert stepped in for a bit.Schallert I didn't mind as much but he seemed to go to the opposite extreme of Aidman and was kind of a milquetoast.And of course two ""Gilligans Island"" refugees stepped in in the same ep and that was Jim Backus and Alan Hale Jr.And speaking of ""Gilligans Island"",the opening of the ep ""The Night of Bleak Island"" is the same opening from ""Gilligans Island"",the one showing the boat being pitched about in a storm!It's obvious the budget for this season was next to non existent as the locations were becoming eerily similar,from ep to ep.In fact San Francisco was visited ALOT in this final season...must have been for the fresh ocean air! In fact any city that had a waterfront looked alot like San Francisco.Footage was also pulled right out of a season three ep to make up time in one of this seasons' eps.It concerned Conrad getting put down a perilous deep hole and landing on a ledge which is close to breaking away.Same precarious position and he extracates himself exactly the same way because...it's the same footage.I could go on but I'm sure you get the picture.However this season,again like the others,has been remastered and most eps here are in good,crisp colour and haven't been seen this well ever.In conclusion, there are alot of negatives which will be of concern to some and little to others,and visa versa.But there are also some positives and I think it's worth getting.When all is said and done and what matters most,is that Martin and Conrad helped create two unforgettable TV characters that have endured and stood the test of time.As long as you keep that in mind when you are watching this final season,it will help you overlook the drawbacks that creep in from time to time.",3,"The Wild,Wild West ends its four year run,better than I remember!",1210118400,"05 7, 2008",2008,4940,"['had', ""n't"", 'seen',

1124767,A1J03J0HZ7KU5T,B00105307O,Scott T. Rivers,"[21, 22]","""The Wild Wild West"" encountered a few production problems toward the end of its run. Ross Martin's mid-season heart attack resulted in a variety of guest agents. There also was the issue of Robert Conrad's near-fatal stunt mishap in ""The Night of the Fugitives,"" followed by a Congressional crusade that forced CBS to place restrictions on the show's comic-book violence. Amidst the behind-the-scenes turmoil were classic adventures such as ""The Night of the Big Blackmail,"" ""The Night of Fire and Brimstone"" and ""The Night of the Kraken."" Unfortunately, Michael Dunn's final appearance as Dr. Loveless suffered from a lackluster script and Martin's absence. Though uneven, Season Four marked a welcome return to the bizarre fantasies that were absent in the 1967-68 episodes. Strangely enough, ""The Wild Wild West"" remains the only series in television history to be canceled for ""excessive violence"" - a political scapegoat in the aftermath of the King and Kennedy assassinations.

1124768,A2QQHIY23PL7H3,B00105307O,Simon,"[0, 0]","As with some of the other 60s shows I've reviewed (ie.Mission Impossible - The Complete First TV Season), I should acknowledge I was born long after this series ended and only caught some brief snippets in re-runs on TBS. But I'm a fan of the 60s spy genre, and decided to give The Wild Wild West a look.This series is great fun, and credit goes to Robert Conrad and Ross Martin for creating great leading characters that have aged fairly well. Conrad plays James West exactly like what you'd want from a James Bond character in the old west - a dash of charm, charisma and authority, and a whole lot of toughness (more on that later). Ross Martin gets to indulge in a parade of interesting disguises and accents - a few of these likely wouldn't be p.c. today, but hey those were the times. Unfortunately Martin suffered a heart attack this year, forcing some fill-in guest agents (including Gilligan's Island star Alan Hale Jr).The stories hit all your spy genre and western staples and then some - there's a pretty effects-heavy episode that features a giant kraken, which given 1960s effects you have to take with a few grains of salt. Michael Dunn's Dr. Loveless appears for the last time with a steam-powered robot, and another episode features a tank-like device called the juggernaut. The stories are played straight even when they venture into sci-fi territory, and at their best recall the old 'Republic Serial' style of adventure. There also seems to be an endless line of hot 60's actresses that guest star in every episode, including Lana Wood. It's almost like Robert Conrad had some clause in his contract that required at least one pretty girl per episode....And last but not least, the action sequences are great. You'll find fights from today's shows may look more brutal and intense at first glance, but that's with a lot of clever photography and editing. In The Wild Wild West, you'll see one-take wide shots with people tossing each other over counters, tabletops, climbing onto 2nd-floor balconies and throwing others off, hurtling from staircases into crates, etc. It's amazing what Robert Conrad and the stunt team pulled off for a weekly TV show.

1124776,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B00105307O,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[8, 9]","The fourth season of ""The Wild Wild West"" found the series returning to form with more fantastic stories than the third season but the show fell victim to increasing criticism about the level of violence in TV shows. Coupled with decreasing ratings for the series the show was cancelled by CBS. To make matters more difficult it was a very good but uneven season due partially to the absence of Ross Martin who suffered a heart attack midway through the production schedule. Martin and Conrad had a unique chemistry which helped sell even the weakest episodes of the series coasting along the action and charm of its stars.The producers solution was admirable and smart--Gordon was in Washington on ""special assignment"" communicating periodically with West via notes and voice transcriptions while he was ""away"". A series of guest stars from the well known Victor Buno (who played a villain previously on the series), Alan Hale, Jr. (""Gilligan's Island""), Pat Paulsen (""Laugh In""), William Schallert and the wonderfully underrated character actor Charles Aidman (who appeared in such shows ""The Twilight Zone""--both the original and as narrator for the last season of the 1985 revival of the show--, ""Dallas"" and the film ""Twilight's Last Gleaming"") who appeared in fourth consecutive episodes as Jeremy Pike.The fourth season started off strong and featured a parade of well known guest stars including Ted Knight (""The Mary Tyler Moore Show""), Harvey Korman (""The Carol Burnett Show""), singer Jackie DeShannon, Jim Backus ( who appears in the same episode as his former ""Gilligan's Island"" co-star Alan Hale. The episode has a very clever tongue-in-cheek reference to the other series). Other guest stars included Kevin McCarthy (""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"") boxer Floyd Patterson.The multi-talented Michael Dunn returned in his final episode as Dr. Loveless and, although memorable as always, the episode was a bit lackluster compared to his previous appearances in the series.This set as with the previous ones is packaged in thin packs with two discs per thin pack. The final season had 24 episodes and we get all 24 in their original uncut versions. Episode information is on the back of each thin pack along with a brief plot synopsis and some of the guest stars. The design of the package and photos used are, as always, first class.As always, Paramount-CBS does a magnificent job with a sharp transfer with the rich, saturated colors the show was known for. Detail and image sharpness are both very good although there are a couple of soft spots that appear now and again. The audio sounds terrific with a nice mono transfer free of hiss and the audio artifacts that you generally expect from something that has had No Noise applied to its soundtrack. The music is, as always, bold and memorable.The music leads me to the major drawback of the set--no extras. While we get all 24 uncut episodes, the show could stand to have a few minor extras produced for it. We do get previews for John Wayne films on DVD but nothing related to ""The Wild Wild West"". For example, a featurette on actor Ross Martin who had a storied career in television, film and on stage would have been nice. Although star Robert Conrad would go on to star in other TV shows (including ""Baa Baa Black Sheep"" another show with a repetitive title), Martin confined his work to guest work with a brief reoccurring role in ""Hawaii Five-O"" during its 1978/9 season. He was a talented, versatile actor who was sorely missed after his death in 1981. He did appear in the two ""The Wild Wild West"" TV movies produced by CBS and plans were in place to revive the series but were scuttled when Martin passed away.Another featurette that would have been worthwhile would have been on Robert Conrad's storied career. Conrad who was born Konrad Robert Falkowski often did his own stunts working with the stunt coordinator and, in fact, was seriously injured during one stunt. He was an honorary member of the Stuntmen's Association. Let's not overlook the talented overlooked actor the late  Michael Dunn as well.Another featurette that would have been good (CBS when you do the Blu-ray for this series I hope you're paying attention to these notes) for this set would have been one on the incidental music which often incorporated a unusual instruments including middle-eastern ones (clearly the 60's music scene was influential in the scoring).A couple of commentary tracks from the surviving cast members (Conrad is evidently ill at the time of this writing so sent your good wishes and prayers his way) including Harvey Korman and Kevin McCarthy would have been nice as well.What we do get is marvelous. I'm happy that CBS has continued to put out the last season of the show but disappointed that they didn't think it worthwhile (or weren't given the budget) to put some extras on this final season saluting the cast, crew and popularity of the show. Nevertheless, this is an essential season and I personally think even though it is a bit uneven due to Ross Martin's absence, it was a fine return to form for the most part. I'd highly recommend the 4th season of ""The Wild Wild West"".",4,The final season of the popular series looks great but is without extras,1205798400,"03 18, 2008",2008,5161,"['fourth', 'season',
