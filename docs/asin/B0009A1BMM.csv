It was a informative story that was more in depth than any American film has done.

902764,A2MHFREDNG3GL8,B0009A1BMM,"Bethanne Delgaudio ""North Country""","[2, 2]","After the series LeFemme Nikita ended I hoped that Roy Dupuis would do another series.  I soon realized this would probably not happen after reading and seeing several post Nikita interviews.  When I heard that he was making a mini-series in Canada I had hoped that it would be shown in the US, but it was not. I was happy to be able to locate it and purchase it on Amazon.  It lived up to its name, The Last Chapter. As always Roy Dupuis'performance is thought provoking and real. Without giving away any of the plot his role as Ross is as introspective and riveting as that of Michael Samuel.",5,Excellent,1276473600,"06 14, 2010",2010,594,"['series', 'LeFemme', 'Nikita', 'ended', 'hoped', 'Roy', 'Dupuis', 'would', 'do', 'series', 'soon', 'realized', 'would', 'probably', 'not', 'happen', 'reading', 'seeing', 'several', 'post', 'Nikita', 'interviews', 'When', 'heard', 'was', 'making', 'mini-series', 'Canada', 'had', 'hoped', 'would', 'be', 'shown', 'US', 'was', 'not', 'was', 'happy', 'be', 'able', 'locate', 'purchase', 'Amazon', 'lived', 'up', 'name', 'Last', 'Chapter', 'always', 'Roy', ""Dupuis'performance"", 'thought', 'provoking', 'real', 'giving', 'away', 'plot', 'role', 'Ross', 'introspective', 'riveting', 'Michael', 'Samuel']",The Last Chapter: The Complete Series

902766,A2ILEJ670X5XNV,B0009A1BMM,Rob White,"[1, 1]","I had a very poor quality VHS home made copy of The Last Chapter that I bought in the late 90's and it was very hard to watch. It was taped by a Canadian off the television . It was just recently released in the US on DVD and I ordered it right away ! It is a story of a large motorcycle club that is taking in smaller clubs to expand. The new leader is not really a biker but a yuppie who takes up golf and drives an expensive sports car. He is a killer and sits on top of a large drug business . This show sucks you in , I actually like it better than Sons of Anarchy . It is like the Sopranos on Wheels and is much more realistic than some other biker shows . I give it three thumbs up !",5,Great Veiwing !

902768,A2RO40LIBUA67E,B0009A1BMM,"Wayne Beckham ""Military vet, defense contacto...","[1, 1]","This was either a series or mini-series for CBC and is a dramatization of the so-called""biker wars""between the HA's and (apparently)every other club in Canada.The rip-off of the clubs is obvious, right down the ""Triple-Sixer's"" red & white colors and the""Los Matadores'""red and gold.  The similarities are so blatant that the Matadores don't sport an M/C patch.  If you watch closely, you'll see that their patch reads, MG - motorcycle gang, just like the Bandido's did at one point in the 70's.This series is hard-core and makes theSons of Anarchylook like a bunch of boy scouts.  There is little sympathetic in any of the characters, especially Michael Ironsides who plays the main protagonist of the series, Bob Durelle.  Durelle is obviously based on the life ofWalter Stadnick.If you've any interest in the history or culture of the biker phenomenon, this series should definitely be part of your collection.",5,"There Should be a Disclaimer: ""Based on True Events""",1303257600,"04 20, 2011",2011,913,"['was', 'series', 'mini-series', 'CBC', 'dramatization', 'so-called', 'biker', 'wars', 'HA', 'apparently', 'other', 'club', 'Canada.The', 'rip-off', 'clubs', 'obvious', 'right', 'Triple-Sixer', 'red', 'white', 'colors', 'Los', 'Matadores', 'red', 'gold', 'similarities', 'are', 'so', 'blatant', 'Matadores', 'do', ""n't"", 'sport', 'M/C', 'patch', 'watch', 'closely', ""'ll"", 'see', 'patch', 'reads', 'MG', 'motorcycle', 'gang', 'just', 'Bandido', 'did', 'one', 'point', ""70's.This"", 'series', 'hard-core', 'theSons', 'Anarchylook', 'bunch', 'boy', 'scouts', 'little', 'sympathetic', 'characters', 'especially', 'Michael', 'Ironsides', 'who', 'main', 'protagonist', 'series', 'Bob', 'Durelle', 'Durelle', 'obviously', 'based', 'life', 'ofWalter', 'Stadnick.If', ""'ve"", 'interest', 'history', 'culture', 'biker', 'phenomenon', 'series', 'should', 'definitely', 'be', 'part', 'collection']",The Last Chapter: The Complete Series
