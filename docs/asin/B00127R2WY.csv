Johnson ""Saja-chan""","[0, 0]","As I am lazy and my sentiments are pretty much the same as when I reviewed the first three boxsets, I pretty much c/p'd those reviews and just added necessary changes.If you love the Fullmetal Alchemist anime, this is a great box set to get. This box set comes with DVDs 11-13 of the series as well as booklets/inserts for each DVD. Each booklet contains beautiful artwork from the show, character profiles, and comments from production staff. The main box and the boxes that hold the discs and inserts are really well done; they keep everything safe and have great artwork.I noticed the product description didn't have a rating. I, personally, wouldn't recommend this for those under 13-14 years of age, but those commenting on my previous reviews felt that ages 10-12 would be alright with it. Things get violent and there are several adult topics prevalent (war, murder, politics, racism). If you are unsure about it, just watch it before you let the children do and make your own judgment call.Also, if you are expecting this to be the end, think again. The TV series has a somewhat open ending which is closed with the movie -Fullmetal Alchemist The Movie - The Conqueror of Shamballa. I'd recommend getting the movie as well if you plan to purchase this boxset.",5,Ending..but not quite.,1209340800,"04 28, 2008",2008,1267,"['am', 'lazy', 'sentiments', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'when', 'reviewed', 'first', 'three', 'boxsets', 'pretty', 'much', 'c/p', ""'d"", 'reviews', 'just', 'added', 'necessary', 'changes.If', 'love', 'Fullmetal', 'Alchemist', 'anime', 'great', 'box', 'set', 'get', 'box', 'set', 'DVDs', '11-13', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'booklets/inserts', 'DVD', 'booklet', 'beautiful', 'artwork', 'show', 'character', 'profiles', 'comments', 'production', 'staff', 'main', 'box', 'boxes', 'hold', 'discs', 'inserts', 'are', 'really', 'well', 'done', 'keep', 'everything', 'safe', 'have', 'great', 'artwork.I', 'noticed', 'product', 'description', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'rating', 'personally', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', '13-14', 'years', 'age', 'commenting', 'previous', 'reviews', 'felt', '10-12', 'would', 'be', 'alright', 'Things', 'get', 'violent', 'are', 'several', 'topics', 'prevalent', 'war', 'murder', 'politics', 'racism', 'are', 'unsure', 'just', 'watch', 'let', 'children', 'do', 'make', 'own', 'judgment', 'call.Also', 'are', 'expecting', 'be', 'end', 'think', 'again', 'TV', 'series', 'somewhat', 'open', 'ending', 'closed', 'movie', '-Fullmetal', 'Alchemist', 'Movie', 'Conqueror', 'Shamballa', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'getting', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'plan', 'purchase', 'boxset']","Fullmetal Alchemist: Season 2, Part 2"

1135421,A7X33R976MR9L,B00127R2WY,L. A Walsh,"[2, 2]","I have been an FMA fan since its early days on Adult Swim--and to be fair, I have owned this original series, own the entire manga series and also own Brotherhood and BOTH theatrical releases. I'd say I'm in a position to make a pretty fair judgement on the two series...and I personally believe the Original Series outshines the manga/FMA-B, even though the manga/FMA-B are the 'authorized vision"" of the original creator, Arakawa...but hear me out on this, please.The Manga, whose story diverges from THIS original series after the encounter between Hughes and Envy, was far from completed when this series was developed. The original anime was created with the author's full approval and cooperation. Arakawa even revealed the final plot elements that would conclude the story and there are some references to them if you're familiar with both stories (ex: Mustang's 'vision', the Ed's alchemic abilities at the end of both stories,etc). However, it was clear that the series would be one side of the FMA story, while Arakawa's as-yet-not-even-half-finished masterpiece would continue.What is the essential difference--plot and characters aside? Why is the Original Series considered to be better by so many fans?Simple. FMA The Manga/FMA Brotherhood was published in a young teen monthly manga digest(Shounen Gangan). It was aimed at a target audience of young people and older children, even though it became hugely popular world wide with audiences of all ages. The Original Series seems to be shooting for an older viewing audience, and the developed scripts and storyline and plotting reflect that.The manga's 'evil' was a meglomaniac supernatural being unleashed upon the world and determined to become a god, with humanity as little more than a useable resource. Like Dragonball Z, our heroes have to ""go Super Saiyan"" to save the world. For a Shounen/Young Adult manga plotline, that's workable. Some adult readers/viewers may find it formulaic and may feel dissatisifed by the neat,""happily ever after"" elements of the awkward ending. It's man vs Supernatural Menace.The evil in the Original Series comes from within the human nature. The quest for immortality that triggers the events in the manga (the King of Xerxes and the Creature in the Flask) is scaled on a human level--Dante and Hohenheim's quest for eternal life. It is humans that create the Sins through the folly of attempting to return the dead to life--not a supernatural madman and his human minions. At every turn, evil is the consequence of human greed, hubris and ignorance and nothing will ever match the horror of Edward learning the truth about Sloth and his helplessness in the face of that truth. Time and again, it all falls back on human responsiblity and human failure...and is redeemed by humans willing to sacrifice anything and everything to restore the balance again.It's that depth of storytelling, for me personally, places this original series above the manga/brotherhood storyline. Rather than the vision of the comic artist, it is the work of screen writers and I find it far more compelling. I'm sure a lot of people will strongly disagree and Funimation is certainly doing all it can to get the original series out of the catalog and out of memory--but it won't work for the fans that love this--which is why I bought two complete series box sets--one to watch and one to lend to friends.This has no ""happy"" ending--it is bittersweet and stunning and ultimately satisfying.",5,Essential Anime--and better than Brotherhood (some spoilers here),1361664000,"02 24, 2013",2013,3473,"['have', 'been', 'FMA', 'fan', 'early', 'days', 'Adult', 'Swim', 'be', 'fair', 'have', 'owned', 'original', 'series', 'entire', 'manga', 'series', 'also', 'own', 'Brotherhood', 'BOTH', 'theatrical', 'releases', ""'d"", 'say', ""'m"", 'position', 'make', 'pretty', 'fair', 'judgement', 'two', 'series', 'personally', 'believe', 'Original', 'Series', 'manga/FMA-B', 'even', 'manga/FMA-B', 'are', ""'authorized"", 'vision', 'original', 'creator', 'Arakawa', 'hear', 'out', 'please.The', 'Manga', 'story', 'THIS', 'original', 'series', 'encounter', 'Hughes', 'Envy', 'was', 'far', 'completed', 'when', 'series', 'was', 'developed', 'original', 'anime', 'was', 'created', 'author', 'full', 'approval', 'cooperation', 'Arakawa', 'even', 'revealed', 'final', 'plot', 'elements', 'would', 'conclude', 'story', 'are', 'references', ""'re"", 'familiar', 'stories', 'ex', 'Mustang', ""'vision"", 'Ed', 'alchemic', 'abilities', 'end', 'stories', 'etc', 'However', 'was', 'clear', 'series', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'side', 'FMA', 'story', 'Arakawa', 'as-yet-not-even-half-finished', 'masterpiece', 'would', 'continue.What', 'essential', 'difference', 'plot', 'characters', 'aside', 'Why', 'Original', 'Series', 'considered', 'be', 'better', 'so', 'many', 'fans', 'Simple', 'FMA', 'Manga/FMA', 'Brotherhood', 'was', 'published', 'young', 'teen', 'monthly', 'manga', 'digest', 'Shounen', 'Gangan', 'was', 'aimed', 'target', 'audience', 'young', 'people', 'older', 'children', 'even', 'became', 'hugely', 'popular', 'world', 'wide', 'audiences', 'ages', 'Original', 'Series', 'be', 'shooting', 'older', 'viewing', 'audience', 'developed', 'scripts', 'storyline', 'plotting', 'reflect', 'that.The', 'manga', ""'evil"", 'was', 'meglomaniac', 'supernatural', 'being', 'unleashed', 'world', 'determined', 'become', 'god', 'humanity', 'little', 'more', 'useable', 'resource', 'Dragonball', 'Z', 'heroes', 'have', 'go', 'Super', 'Saiyan', 'save', 'world', 'Shounen/Young', 'Adult', 'manga', 'plotline', 'workable', 'adult', 'readers/viewers', 'may', 'find', 'formulaic', 'may', 'feel', 'dissatisifed', 'neat', 'happily', 'ever', 'elements', 'awkward', 'ending', 'man', 'vs', 'Supernatural', 'Menace.The', 'evil', 'Original', 'Series', 'human', 'nature', 'quest', 'immortality', 'events', 'manga', 'King', 'Xerxes', 'Creature', 'Flask', 'scaled', 'human', 'level', 'Dante', 'Hohenheim', 'quest', 'eternal', 'life', 'humans', 'create', 'Sins', 'folly', 'attempting', 'return', 'dead', 'life', 'not', 'supernatural', 'madman', 'human', 'minions', 'turn', 'consequence', 'human', 'greed', 'hubris', 'ignorance', 'nothing', 'will', 'ever', 'match', 'horror', 'Edward', 'learning', 'truth', 'Sloth', 'helplessness', 'face', 'truth', 'Time', 'again', 'back', 'human', 'responsiblity', 'human', 'failure', 'redeemed', 'humans', 'willing', 'sacrifice', 'anything', 'everything', 'restore', 'balance', 'again.It', 'depth', 'storytelling', 'personally', 'places', 'original', 'series', 'manga/brotherhood', 'storyline', 'Rather', 'vision', 'comic', 'artist', 'work', 'screen', 'writers', 'find', 'far', 'more', 'compelling', ""'m"", 'sure', 'lot', 'people', 'will', 'strongly', 'disagree', 'Funimation', 'certainly', 'doing', 'can', 'get', 'original', 'series', 'catalog', 'memory', 'wo', ""n't"", 'work', 'fans', 'love', 'why', 'bought', 'two', 'complete', 'series', 'box', 'sets', 'one', 'watch', 'one', 'lend', 'friends.This', 'happy', 'ending', 'bittersweet', 'stunning', 'ultimately', 'satisfying']","Fullmetal Alchemist: Season 2, Part 2"
