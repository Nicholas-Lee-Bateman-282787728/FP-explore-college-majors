They are there to mate, birth, and care for their chick.Monogamous for that year, penguins pair up and the mother lays an egg.The mother dashes off back to the sea, which, thanks to the winter and new ice, is as far as 70 miles. She's starving, having lost one-third of her weight in laying the egg. The trip is long, and she's not fast. Hungry seals await them, some penguins lose their way, and some are too exhausted to continue.Well-fed, full of food for her chick, she returns, and the father makes the same trip so he can eat. The father stayed behind to incubate the egg, and protect the new chick. He has lost one half of his weight.The pair trade places a few more times as winter plods on. With temperatures 80 below zero, and winds up to 125, I felt cold just watching. The penguins huddle to keep warm, rotating which must do outside duty.Morgan Freeman narrates. His voice does not overcome the story. Better written than any documentary I have ever seen, Freeman respects the script. Having never seen a documentary in a theater before, I was impressed at how well it worked on the big screen.There is no plot, even though there is a beginning and an end. Unlike many documentaries, it does not detail the intricacies of eating, mate choosing, or science of penguin living. It is more about watching the arduous life cycle, with some explaining what we are watching.The camera works captures the cold -- the shivering penguins, the snow blowing like dust over the long line of marching penguins. It reminded me of movies about Siberia, showing Soviets living in a frozen, cold natural prison.This isn't a cute animal movie. Tender children might be saddened to see the eggs and chicks freezing, and could be quite frightened when the vicious seals overtake swimming penguins.I fully recommend ""March of the Penguins.""Anthony Trendleditor, HungarianBookstore.com",5,The Cold Life of Emperor Penguins,1122336000,"07 26, 2005",2005,2109,"['chose', 'see', 'March', 'Penguins', 'diversion', '100+', 'degree', 'day', 'saw', 'cold', 'weather', 'worse', 'hot', 'weather.Penguins', 'several', 'areas', 'Antarctica', 'converge', 'land', 'safe', 'predators', 'ebbing', 'ice', 'shelf', 'are', 'there', 'mate', 'birth', 'care', 'chick.Monogamous', 'year', 'penguins', 'pair', 'up', 'mother', 'egg.The', 'mother', 'off', 'back', 'sea', 'thanks', 'winter', 'new', 'ice', 'as', 'far', '70', 'miles', 'starving', 'having', 'lost', 'one-third', 'weight', 'laying', 'egg', 'trip', 'long', 'not', 'fast', 'Hungry', 'seals', 'await', 'penguins', 'lose', 'way', 'are', 'too', 'exhausted', 'continue.Well-fed', 'full', 'food', 'chick', 'father', 'same', 'trip', 'can', 'eat', 'father', 'stayed', 'incubate', 'egg', 'protect', 'new', 'chick', 'lost', 'one', 'half', 'weight.The', 'pair', 'trade', 'few', 'more', 'times', 'winter', 'plods', 'temperatures', '80', 'zero', 'up', '125', 'felt', 'cold', 'just', 'watching', 'penguins', 'huddle', 'keep', 'warm', 'rotating', 'must', 'do', 'duty.Morgan', 'Freeman', 'narrates', 'voice', 'not', 'overcome', 'story', 'Better', 'written', 'documentary', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Freeman', 'script', 'Having', 'never', 'seen', 'documentary', 'theater', 'was', 'impressed', 'how', 'well', 'worked', 'big', 'screen.There', 'plot', 'even', 'beginning', 'end', 'many', 'documentaries', 'not', 'detail', 'intricacies', 'eating', 'mate', 'choosing', 'science', 'penguin', 'living', 'more', 'watching', 'arduous', 'life', 'cycle', 'explaining', 'what', 'are', 'watching.The', 'camera', 'cold', 'shivering', 'penguins', 'snow', 'blowing', 'dust', 'long', 'line', 'marching', 'penguins', 'reminded', 'movies', 'Siberia', 'showing', 'Soviets', 'living', 'frozen', 'cold', 'natural', 'prison.This', ""n't"", 'cute', 'animal', 'movie', 'Tender', 'children', 'might', 'be', 'saddened', 'see', 'eggs', 'chicks', 'freezing', 'could', 'be', 'quite', 'frightened', 'when', 'vicious', 'seals', 'overtake', 'swimming', 'penguins.I', 'fully', 'recommend', 'March', 'Penguins', 'Anthony', 'Trendleditor', 'HungarianBookstore.com']",N/A
640191,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B00005JOFZ,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[1, 1]","March of the Penguins follows a year in the life of the male and female Emperor penguins.  After a summer of frolicking in the refreshing artic waters and building up body fat, they begin the long trek to their sheltered mating ground area 70 miles away.  Here, at what looks like a massive penguin cocktail party, the penguins pair off one by one, looking for all the world like they are head over heels in love.  Each of these unions produces a single egg, which the mother passes to the father to protect for the winter months while she returns to the ocean to feed, as giving birth has left her near starvation.Once the mothers leave, the fathers huddle together, enduring unimaginably hazardous conditions in order to ensure the safe hatching of their little chicks.  Eventually, the mothers return to meet and nourish their little ones, while the fathers--now near starvation themselves--take their own turn at feeding.  Amazingly, the fathers are able to learn the unique call of their newborns so that they will be able to find each other upon their return.  The father and mother continue to switch places until finally, the entire family is ready to make the journey back to the sea and the reluctant youngsters are ready to set forth on their own.Although I've seen many National Geographic and similar TV specials telling much the same story featured here, seeing this film's stunningly gorgeous photography on the wide screen definitely made the trip to the theater worth it.  Although I would recommend this as a family film, I would caution parents of young children, as the little ones might well be frightened by the treacherous snow storms as well as several penguin deaths (including the loss of a chick and the capture of an adult by a seal).  Overall, however, I highly recommend this feature, particularly to anyone who would like to witness the miracle life as evidenced by one very resilient species.",4,"A touching, beautifully shot film",1124496000,"08 20, 2005",2005,1924,"['March', 'Penguins', 'year', 'life', 'male', 'female', 'Emperor', 'penguins', 'summer', 'frolicking', 'refreshing', 'artic', 'waters', 'building', 'up', 'body', 'fat', 'begin', 'long', 'trek', 'sheltered', 'mating', 'ground', 'area', '70', 'miles', 'away', 'Here', 'what', 'massive', 'penguin', 'cocktail', 'party', 'penguins', 'pair', 'off', 'one', 'one', 'looking', 'world', 'are', 'head', 'heels', 'love', 'unions', 'single', 'egg', 'mother', 'father', 'protect', 'winter', 'months', 'ocean', 'feed', 'giving', 'birth', 'left', 'near', 'starvation.Once', 'mothers', 'leave', 'fathers', 'huddle', 'together', 'enduring', 'unimaginably', 'hazardous', 'conditions', 'order', 'ensure', 'safe', 'hatching', 'little', 'chicks', 'Eventually', 'mothers', 'return', 'meet', 'nourish', 'little', 'ones', 'fathers', 'now', 'starvation', 'take', 'own', 'turn', 'feeding', 'Amazingly', 'fathers', 'are', 'able', 'learn', 'unique', 'call', 'newborns', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'find', 'other', 'return', 'father', 'mother', 'continue', 'switch', 'places', 'finally', 'entire', 'family', 'ready', 'make', 'journey', 'back', 'sea', 'reluctant', 'youngsters', 'are', 'ready', 'set', 'forth', 'own.Although', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'National', 'Geographic', 'similar', 'TV', 'specials', 'telling', 'much', 'same', 'story', 'featured', 'here', 'seeing', 'film', 'stunningly', 'gorgeous', 'photography', 'wide', 'screen', 'definitely', 'made', 'trip', 'theater', 'would', 'recommend', 'family', 'film', 'would', 'caution', 'parents', 'young', 'children', 'little', 'ones', 'might', 'well', 'be', 'frightened', 'treacherous', 'snow', 'storms', 'as', 'well', 'several', 'penguin', 'deaths', 'including', 'loss', 'chick', 'capture', 'adult', 'seal', 'Overall', 'however', 'highly', 'recommend', 'feature', 'particularly', 'anyone', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'witness', 'miracle', 'life', 'evidenced', 'one', 'very', 'resilient', 'species']",N/A
640192,A2F3SXHT6RBV81,B00005JOFZ,"Betty Burks ""Betty  Burks""","[1, 14]","I had an encounter at the post office with a sensitive man who had a different reaction to this movie and so I feel I must give a perspective which may be important to others, which I missed.  I did feel the majesty of the music and the way they endured so much hardship to propogate their species and how very hard it was to see a cub penguin to his tottler stage and to adulthood.  Perhaps I was just tired when I saw it and the long journey to and from the mating point wore me out with their struggle.  The penguins did look like empire something or other as they dutifully made their annual pilgrimage to find a mate and reproduce, stay there during the worst of the weather to keep the egg safe and warm, and then to experience the death of the cub if the mother did not return.  I know that animals don't have emotions as we do and perhaps I was being too radical.  The man asked if I were a liberal.  I said that I am neither liberal or conservative, as I am not politically motivated.  He was most irritated to say the least with my 'version' as he was not expecting anyone to feel that inhumanely.I am most humane.  Yesterday I used a table napkin to remove the remains of a kitten from a busy street, as I do love animals and could not walk by and allow it to stay there to be mutilated by the cars.  Poor kitty was not stiff but definitely dead.So I attempted to talk with someone who always has a different view from mine on almost everything but he said that he had not seen the movie.  I told him that I think I should change my review.  And so I am adding this possibility that I missed the ethereal feeling this man experienced and his feeling that they would go to such extremes to protect their young.  We humans would do the same thing (with emotions) if our offspring died -- which I really think that the penguins could not feel.  It was almost as Godly as Jonathan Livingston Seagull, and I did put emotions in his advice to Fletcher.  Maybe the male penguins do have feelings toward their young, but I did not get that from this movie.  I could be wrong.Emperor penguins lived in Antartica which was 58 degrees below freezing.  I'm glad I got out my old video of 'Jonathan Livingston Seagull' and looked at it again because this is a 'mature' bird story of the flock and its strict behavior and laud, cawing noises, and uttering as they huddled together in the cold.Half of the audience was children, so I was embarrasses with the explicit sexual aspects of this documentary.  It is the story of survival and love, according to the narrator, but it was a sex manual about penguin mating and birthing (then caring for) in a reversal roles of the babies which survived the mating process.  It was a slow affair, like a swan dance  They had some strange mating posturing and selection of who would be the one this year.  The male would have his sharp beak stuck in the female's throat while he did his little deed.  Always they would travel seventy miles from the sea to the place of their birth to mate with nomads from other directions who had been birthed there also.Some of them did cross-country skiing on their full tummies,  They waddle, don't walk, because of their girth and weight.  It was amusing to watch, and the Knoxville people and kids would laugh when someone slipped down or such a mishap.  Otherwise, they were intent on learning the sex practices of another species.Unlike humans, they appeared 'overjoyed' when the egg appears.  Only one so they are somewhat like humans in that respect.  The mother deserts the egg to travel the seventy miles to the ocean to get food.  Sometimes, the hugh seals would kill some of the females.  Thus, he was killing two as the baby could not survive without the food she would bring back.Sometimes the egg would get cracked and frozen while being transferred from the female to the male.  If that happened, their big affair was over and they went their separate ways.  Only the strongest survive, those who lose the egg are outcasts, just as Jon Seagull.  The males have a hard time surviving while sheltering the egg and keeping it warm; the older ones 'give up the ghost' and lay down to die.  When the mother does not get back by a certain time, the baby starves to death.Those little cuties which did make it to toddler stage, enjoyed playing with each other, but the awful hawk would come down to catch one.  They'd stay together as he pecked at them, but always one would get scared and run; this is the one to be killed by the predator.  This was a cold movie; I was glad I took a jacket.  It was 86 degrees outside here.",3,Penguins are The Only Ones to Survive On the Antartica Ice .,1122681600,"07 30, 2005",2005,4605,"['had', 'encounter', 'post', 'office', 'sensitive', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'different', 'reaction', 'movie', 'so', 'feel', 'must', 'give', 'perspective', 'may', 'be', 'important', 'others', 'missed', 'did', 'feel', 'majesty', 'music', 'way', 'endured', 'so', 'much', 'hardship', 'propogate', 'species', 'how', 'very', 'hard', 'was', 'see', 'cub', 'penguin', 'tottler', 'stage', 'adulthood', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'just', 'tired', 'when', 'saw', 'long', 'journey', 'mating', 'point', 'wore', 'struggle', 'penguins', 'did', 'look', 'empire', 'something', 'other', 'dutifully', 'made', 'annual', 'pilgrimage', 'find', 'mate', 'reproduce', 'stay', 'there', 'worst', 'weather', 'keep', 'egg', 'safe', 'warm', 'then', 'experience', 'death', 'cub', 'mother', 'did', 'not', 'return', 'know', 'animals', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'emotions', 'do', 'perhaps', 'was', 'being', 'too', 'radical', 'man', 'asked', 'were', 'liberal', 'said', 'am', 'neither', 'liberal', 'conservative', 'am', 'not', 'politically', 'motivated', 'was', 'most', 'irritated', 'say', 'least', ""'version"", 'was', 'not', 'expecting', 'anyone', 'feel', 'inhumanely.I', 'am', 'most', 'humane', 'Yesterday', 'used', 'table', 'napkin', 'remove', 'remains', 'kitten', 'busy', 'street', 'do', 'love', 'animals', 'could', 'not', 'walk', 'allow', 'stay', 'there', 'be', 'mutilated', 'cars', 'Poor', 'kitty', 'was', 'not', 'stiff', 'definitely', 'dead.So', 'attempted', 'talk', 'someone', 'who', 'always', 'different', 'view', 'mine', 'almost', 'everything', 'said', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'movie', 'told', 'think', 'should', 'change', 'review', 'so', 'am', 'adding', 'possibility', 'missed', 'ethereal', 'feeling', 'man', 'experienced', 'feeling', 'would', 'go', 'such', 'extremes', 'protect', 'young', 'humans', 'would', 'do', 'same', 'thing', 'emotions', 'offspring', 'died', 'really', 'think', 'penguins', 'could', 'not', 'feel', 'was', 'almost', 'as', 'Godly', 'Jonathan', 'Livingston', 'Seagull', 'did', 'put', 'emotions', 'advice', 'Fletcher', 'Maybe', 'male', 'penguins', 'do', 'have', 'feelings', 'young', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'wrong.Emperor', 'penguins', 'lived', 'Antartica', 'was', '58', 'degrees', 'freezing', ""'m"", 'glad', 'got', 'out', 'old', 'video', ""'Jonathan"", 'Livingston', 'Seagull', 'looked', 'again', ""'mature"", 'bird', 'story', 'flock', 'strict', 'behavior', 'laud', 'cawing', 'noises', 'uttering', 'huddled', 'together', 'cold.Half', 'audience', 'was', 'children', 'was', 'embarrasses', 'explicit', 'sexual', 'aspects', 'documentary', 'story', 'survival', 'love', 'according', 'narrator', 'was', 'sex', 'manual', 'penguin', 'mating', 'birthing', 'then', 'caring', 'reversal', 'roles', 'babies', 'survived', 'mating', 'process', 'was', 'slow', 'affair', 'swan', 'dance', 'had', 'strange', 'mating', 'posturing', 'selection', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'year', 'male', 'would', 'have', 'sharp', 'beak', 'stuck', 'female', 'throat', 'did', 'little', 'deed', 'would', 'travel', 'seventy', 'miles', 'sea', 'place', 'birth', 'mate', 'nomads', 'other', 'directions', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'birthed', 'also.Some', 'did', 'cross-country', 'skiing', 'full', 'tummies', 'waddle', 'do', ""n't"", 'walk', 'girth', 'weight', 'was', 'amusing', 'watch', 'Knoxville', 'people', 'kids', 'would', 'laugh', 'when', 'someone', 'slipped', 'down', 'such', 'mishap', 'Otherwise', 'were', 'intent', 'learning', 'sex', 'practices', 'species.Unlike', 'humans', 'appeared', ""'overjoyed"", 'when', 'egg', 'Only', 'one', 'are', 'somewhat', 'like', 'humans', 'respect', 'mother', 'egg', 'travel', 'seventy', 'miles', 'ocean', 'get', 'food', 'Sometimes', 'hugh', 'seals', 'would', 'kill', 'females', 'Thus', 'was', 'killing', 'two', 'baby', 'could', 'not', 'survive', 'food', 'would', 'bring', 'back.Sometimes', 'egg', 'would', 'get', 'cracked', 'frozen', 'being', 'transferred', 'female', 'male', 'happened', 'big', 'affair', 'was', 'over', 'went', 'separate', 'ways', 'Only', 'strongest', 'survive', 'who', 'lose', 'egg', 'are', 'outcasts', 'just', 'Jon', 'Seagull', 'males', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'surviving', 'sheltering', 'egg', 'keeping', 'older', 'ones', ""'give"", 'ghost', 'lay', 'down', 'die', 'When', 'mother', 'not', 'get', 'back', 'certain', 'time', 'baby', 'death.Those', 'little', 'cuties', 'did', 'make', 'toddler', 'stage', 'enjoyed', 'playing', 'other', 'awful', 'hawk', 'would', 'come', 'down', 'catch', 'one', ""'d"", 'stay', 'together', 'pecked', 'always', 'one', 'would', 'get', 'scared', 'run', 'one', 'be', 'killed', 'predator', 'was', 'cold', 'movie', 'was', 'glad', 'took', 'jacket', 'was', '86', 'degrees', 'outside', 'here']",N/A

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[1, 2]","In a place as inhospitable as the Antarctic, almost the entire planet will never know the treacherous nature of this continent during its long winter months. There are no land based mammals that could possibly survive here ...except for the Emperor Penguins. Why they still choose to nest here is a mystery (personally if I were them I'd be sucking down drinks poolside in Hawaii or something), but nest they do. And they come by their hundreds, leaping out of the chilly ocean and marching (in March) single-file to their favorite breeding spot, the exact same location where they were born years before. They must have an amazing internal compass.They hike over 70 miles, never eating or drinking, just so they can match up with the opposite sex and produce one egg. And if their egg survives the blistering 80-plus degree below zero temperatures, the shuffling from one parent's feet to another's, the bustling and jostling amongst hundreds of other penguins, they might have a fighting chance. But even if they do survive this, the chicks still have to evade predator birds, and other pitfalls that takes lives so easily in this nearly lifeless land.Narrated by Morgan Freeman's wonderful voice and filmed in unGodly cold conditions, this documentary deserves all the praise it has received.My only beef with the film is that, at times, it seemed to be too anthropomorphic, using words like ""love"", etc. to describe how the parents' cared for each other and their chicks. Whether this is true or not, we'll never know, but what it does do is get the viewer into these animals' lives very intimately (uh-oh!

640196,A2VD3CYOEMJ6SR,B00005JOFZ,David E. Levine,"[3, 3]","How refreshing it is to see a real documentary do well at the box office as opposed to junk documentaries, reflecting the film maker's political biases, which have polluted the box office in recent years. Luc Jacquet's exquisitely filmed nature film promises to be the second largest grossing documentary in the history of the cinema. This compelling film shows the migration of Emperor Penguins as they march 70 miles, through harsh Antartic terrain and weather, to breed. It is extraordinary how they overcome the conditions to reach their goal. Once they reach the breeding grounds, they find mates and for that particular mating season, they remain monogamous.What is particularly compelling is the beautifully filmed social structure of the penguins. The camera catches them seemingly genuinely in love with their mates. When the eggs are laid, they must be shielded from the cold to survive and the mother transfers the egg to the father. It is then the father's job to keep the egg warm while the mother marches back, with the other mothers, to feed and bring back enough food for their soon to be hatched chicks. When they get back, they are able to find their husbands among the man hundreds of other penguins because they learn each other's voices. If a chick dies, the mother's genuine grief, so poignantly captured by the camera, is heart rending. Meanwhile, to survive the harsh winter storms, the penguins huddle together to keep warm and they take turns going into the middle of the group (where it is warmest) and to the outer edge of the group (where they are providing warmth for the others). Later, it becomes the fathers' turn to feed and bring back food for the chicks. Before leaving, they talk to the chicks so they can recognize each others' voices and find each other when they return. They leave and return as a group and somehow find one another in the cacaphony of penguin sounds.

So, after reading the ratings from other viewers on Amazon, we took our granddaughter to see March of the Penguins last Sunday.

Additionally, I tried to gauge the reaction of the children in the audience around us.  Afterwards, in the lobby, I asked several children what they thought about the movie, especially the sad, sad parts.  In every instance, the children (along with their parents)were excited and awed by what they had seen.  One little girl was trying her best to walk down the hallway like a penguin.  Everyone laughed.  We were all caught up in the marches, the protecting of the eggs that, hopefully, could become chicks, and the neverending brutality/beauty of their existence.

Why are so many people flocking to a movie about Antarctic birds? Perhaps because it is absolutely fascinating to watch these incredible creatures overcome tremendous odds in order to mate and nurture their young.""March of the Penguins"" deals with the yearly ritual of thousands of Emperor penguins who live in Antarctica. They leave the sea, which is their source of food, and trek seventy miles to their breeding grounds. When they reach their destination, they mate, and if the mother conceives and later lays an egg, the father takes care of it in his body while the mother makes the long trip back to the sea to gather food. Months later, the chick hatches, and the mother returns with food for her baby. Then, the father travels to the sea to take his turn to feed. The mother protects and nourishes her chick until he is able to take care of himself. During the pitiless winter season, the blizzards and biting winds present a tremendous challenge. The penguins huddle together to keep from freezing, but not all of them survive. If they manage to avoid succumbing to the cold, some penguins fall prey to accidents or predators. Living through this punishing yearly cycle is nothing short of miraculous.This movie is a feast for the eyes. Cinematographers Laurent Chalet and J&eacute;rme Maison capture the forbidding and desolate beauty of Antarctica. The panoramic view of hundreds of penguins waddling down the ice in formation, and occasionally sledding on their bellies, is awesome. I also loved the intimate shots of the penguins, featuring close-ups of their piercing eyes, clawed feet, and furry skin. The director skillfully engages the audience's emotions; we root for the penguins to stay warm, obtain food, and live to produce a new generation. Composer Alex Wurman's lovely original score complements the film perfectly. Morgan Freeman, with his sonorous voice and superb diction, provides the moving and occasionally humorous narration.Some scientists criticize the filmmakers' implication that penguins can love and mourn, much as people do. Ascribing human characteristics to birds may be scientifically invalid, but it does make the audience connect with the penguins in a very personal way. ""March of the Penguins"" is a moving, poignant, and unforgettable film, and I predict that it will become a classic among nature documentaries.",5,Extraordinary.,1125878400,"09 5, 2005",2005,2470,"['summer', 'featuring', 'mostly', 'lackluster', 'movies', 'Luc', 'Jacquet', 'March', 'Penguins', 'become', 'sleeper', 'hit', 'Why', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'flocking', 'movie', 'Antarctic', 'birds', 'Perhaps', 'absolutely', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'incredible', 'creatures', 'overcome', 'tremendous', 'odds', 'order', 'mate', 'nurture', 'young', 'March', 'Penguins', 'deals', 'yearly', 'ritual', 'thousands', 'Emperor', 'penguins', 'who', 'live', 'Antarctica', 'leave', 'sea', 'source', 'food', 'trek', 'seventy', 'miles', 'breeding', 'grounds', 'When', 'reach', 'destination', 'mate', 'mother', 'conceives', 'later', 'egg', 'father', 'care', 'body', 'mother', 'long', 'trip', 'back', 'sea', 'gather', 'food', 'Months', 'later', 'chick', 'hatches', 'mother', 'returns', 'food', 'baby', 'Then', 'father', 'sea', 'take', 'turn', 'feed', 'mother', 'protects', 'nourishes', 'chick', 'able', 'take', 'care', 'pitiless', 'winter', 'season', 'blizzards', 'biting', 'winds', 'present', 'tremendous', 'challenge', 'penguins', 'huddle', 'together', 'keep', 'freezing', 'not', 'survive', 'manage', 'avoid', 'succumbing', 'cold', 'penguins', 'fall', 'prey', 'accidents', 'predators', 'Living', 'punishing', 'yearly', 'cycle', 'nothing', 'short', 'miraculous.This', 'movie', 'feast', 'eyes', 'Cinematographers', 'Laurent', 'Chalet', 'J', 'eacute', 'Maison', 'capture', 'forbidding', 'desolate', 'beauty', 'Antarctica', 'panoramic', 'view', 'hundreds', 'penguins', 'waddling', 'down', 'ice', 'formation', 'occasionally', 'sledding', 'bellies', 'awesome', 'also', 'loved', 'intimate', 'shots', 'penguins', 'featuring', 'close-ups', 'piercing', 'eyes', 'clawed', 'feet', 'furry', 'skin', 'director', 'skillfully', 'audience', 'emotions', 'root', 'penguins', 'stay', 'warm', 'obtain', 'food', 'live', 'produce', 'new', 'generation', 'Composer', 'Alex', 'Wurman', 'lovely', 'original', 'score', 'complements', 'film', 'perfectly', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'sonorous', 'voice', 'superb', 'diction', 'moving', 'occasionally', 'humorous', 'narration.Some', 'scientists', 'criticize', 'filmmakers', 'implication', 'can', 'love', 'mourn', 'much', 'people', 'do', 'Ascribing', 'human', 'characteristics', 'birds', 'may', 'be', 'scientifically', 'invalid', 'make', 'audience', 'connect', 'penguins', 'very', 'personal', 'way', 'March', 'Penguins', 'moving', 'poignant', 'unforgettable', 'film', 'predict', 'will', 'become', 'classic', 'nature', 'documentaries']",N/A

I always loved the emperor penguin but didn't know a whole lot about them. This film really does a thorough job on documenting the life of the emperor penguin, namely when they are in search of a mate. I was amazed to find out what sort of hardship these beautiful creatures would go through to find a mate and to raise a family. Morgan Freeman does an excellent job of narrating the film. I liked how the narration was spread out and that it wasn't needed for every scene in the film. The narration was written by Luc Jacquet. His writing was filled with information and humor. The photography is nothing short of breathtaking especially when the cold, winter months hit the penguins. My favorite moments in the film? A lot of them had to do with the baby penguins which were just so cute. While this film is rated G, there is a few moments that might scare young children but that is reality for the emperor penguin that we see in the film unfortunately. All in all, I loved this film.

Finally showing their weariness for in-your-face explosion-happy summer blockbusters, the public is flocking (bad pun, sorry) to Luc Jacquet's charming natural history documentary ""March of the Penguins"".Ironically, the most interesting thing about this film is that it is an entirely ordinary nature documentary, backed by the National Geographic Society.  It is interesting because the masses have somehow connected with it.There are no characters, no dialogue, and no special effects.  It is an informative film about the nurturing habits of Antarctica's Emperor Penguins, narrated by Morgan Freeman.  It should be noted that Morgan Freeman serves as a narrator for another, very different film currently occupying the multiplexes:  ""War of the Worlds"".For a bird living in the coldest place on Earth, who spends most of its time bracing against the biting wind (in a head-down stance, as if they all lost their contact lenses) ""March of the Penguins"" makes their lives emotional and enthralling.Rather than following a particular penguin, or having an actual plot, like ""The Bear"", this film plays like any other documentary you would see on the Discovery Channel or Animal Planet, staying objective, but allowing the audience to become attached to the adorable birds anyway.Life in Antarctica is tough, however, and, as my calculus-teacher cousin is fond of saying, ""the real world is not nice.""  Not all of the penguins can survive the brutal winter or voracious predators, but death is dealt with so poetically that even the little ones won't be made too upset.However, they may become a little bored, as the film isn't quite the roller coaster of eye candy they've gotten used to over the past few months.  Some parts, like some parts of life, are slow, with not a whole lot going on.  This movie has been called things like ""the best family film of the year"", but despite it's rather short running time, the kids may be a bit squirmy or even sleepy if they're too young.The music won't help matters; it is that sort of ""New Age"" soothing and calm stuff, and you may have to poke your neighbor if it puts him to sleep.""March of the Penguins"" doesn't overly anthropomorphize these animals, like Jean-Jacques Arnaut's ""The Bear"" and ""Two Brothers"" do.  While it is clear these penguins have emotions such as grief, jealousy, and attachment in the film, it is also clear that this wasn't manufactured to make them more appealing to us.  They have real emotions and personalities, complex as any of ours.Nearly as refreshing as a dip in the pool on these scorching summer days, this film's beautiful vistas of ice and snow are welcome relief from the August heat.",5,"""March"": Penguins have never been cooler",1123372800,"08 7, 2005",2005,2750,"['comforting', 'know', 'once', 'while', 'moviegoers', 'can', 'surprise', 'Finally', 'showing', 'weariness', 'in-your-face', 'explosion-happy', 'summer', 'blockbusters', 'public', 'flocking', 'bad', 'pun', 'sorry', 'Luc', 'Jacquet', 'charming', 'natural', 'history', 'documentary', 'March', 'Penguins', '.Ironically', 'most', 'interesting', 'thing', 'film', 'entirely', 'ordinary', 'nature', 'documentary', 'backed', 'National', 'Geographic', 'Society', 'interesting', 'masses', 'have', 'somehow', 'connected', 'are', 'characters', 'dialogue', 'special', 'effects', 'informative', 'film', 'nurturing', 'habits', 'Antarctica', 'Emperor', 'Penguins', 'narrated', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'narrator', 'very', 'different', 'film', 'currently', 'occupying', 'multiplexes', 'War', 'Worlds', 'bird', 'living', 'coldest', 'place', 'Earth', 'who', 'most', 'time', 'bracing', 'biting', 'wind', 'head-down', 'stance', 'lost', 'contact', 'March', 'Penguins', 'lives', 'emotional', 'enthralling.Rather', 'following', 'particular', 'penguin', 'having', 'actual', 'plot', 'Bear', 'film', 'other', 'documentary', 'would', 'see', 'Discovery', 'Channel', 'Animal', 'Planet', 'staying', 'objective', 'allowing', 'audience', 'become', 'attached', 'adorable', 'birds', 'anyway.Life', 'Antarctica', 'tough', 'however', 'calculus-teacher', 'cousin', 'fond', 'saying', 'real', 'world', 'not', 'nice', 'Not', 'penguins', 'can', 'survive', 'brutal', 'winter', 'voracious', 'predators', 'death', 'dealt', 'so', 'poetically', 'even', 'little', 'ones', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'made', 'too', 'upset.However', 'may', 'become', 'little', 'bored', 'film', ""n't"", 'quite', 'roller', 'coaster', 'eye', 'candy', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'used', 'past', 'few', 'months', 'parts', 'parts', 'life', 'are', 'slow', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'going', 'movie', 'been', 'called', 'things', 'best', 'family', 'film', 'year', 'rather', 'short', 'running', 'time', 'kids', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'squirmy', 'even', 'sleepy', ""'re"", 'too', 'young.The', 'music', 'wo', ""n't"", 'help', 'matters', 'sort', 'New', 'Age', 'soothing', 'calm', 'stuff', 'may', 'have', 'poke', 'neighbor', 'sleep', 'March', 'Penguins', ""n't"", 'overly', 'anthropomorphize', 'animals', 'Jean-Jacques', 'Arnaut', 'Bear', 'Two', 'Brothers', 'do', 'clear', 'penguins', 'have', 'emotions', 'such', 'grief', 'jealousy', 'attachment', 'film', 'also', 'clear', 'was', ""n't"", 'manufactured', 'make', 'more', 'appealing', 'have', 'real', 'emotions', 'personalities', 'complex', 'ours.Nearly', 'as', 'refreshing', 'dip', 'pool', 'scorching', 'summer', 'days', 'film', 'beautiful', 'vistas', 'ice', 'snow', 'are', 'welcome', 'relief', 'August', 'heat']",N/A

I went to see it, and was amazed.The plot of the film is extraordinarily simple - the film follows the Emperor Penguins of Antarctica during their annual mating and rearing cycle.  It is framed from start to finish in terms of the march - the march from the sea to the mating spot, the march to return to the sea for food, the march again for rearing the young, and the march again finally to return to the sea.There is a great deal of humour and grace; penguins are gentle beings, vulnerable to predators and to the hazards of the winter - despite being fashioned for some of the coldest climates on earth, they nonetheless require warmth, particularly for their eggs and the hatchlings.  In the severe cold and far-below-zero windchills, many do not make it, and the one negative side of the film for me was a somewhat constant lingering on this downside.  While it is a part of nature, it still becomes a bit more tragic in the cycle of the film than it needs to be.  As this is billed as a family film, I worried that some of the children viewing might be more emotionally upset at this than they needed to be.Still, the details presented are fascinating, and it is a true testament to filmmaking that these shots and images were captured as dramatically, humourously, gracefully and beautifully as they were.This film has 'Academy Award' written all over it, in many categories.  Cinematography, musical score, directing, documentary - these are only some of the categories in which this film is likely to get a nod.  Morgan Freeman never appears on camera, but gives a wonderful reading as the narrator of this visual feast, adding subtle emphasis that never detracts and often adds to the tale in the English-language version of this film.Director Luc Jacquet and cinematographers, Laurent Chalet and Jerome Maison have produced a masterpiece that transcends language barriers (indeed, there is no native human language for Antarctica).  A French team, they have translated this film into many languages around the world, as people everywhere will find something with which they can relate.Perhaps the most skillful part of the filming was to make Antarctica seem so varied in texture and place; on a continent covered with ice and snow, one still gets the sense of the length of the journey, the beauty inherent in the surroundings, and the dangers involved for the penguins.Be sure to stay for the credits, as one gets to see the film crew in some light-hearted scenes with curious penguins.",5,Astonishing!,1126396800,"09 11, 2005",2005,2659,"['have', 'long', 'been', 'admirer', 'penguins', 'so', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'cinema', 'friends', 'variously', 'collectively', 'rushed', 'inform', 'film', 'went', 'see', 'was', 'amazed.The', 'plot', 'film', 'extraordinarily', 'simple', 'film', 'Emperor', 'Penguins', 'Antarctica', 'annual', 'mating', 'rearing', 'cycle', 'framed', 'start', 'finish', 'terms', 'march', 'march', 'sea', 'mating', 'spot', 'march', 'return', 'sea', 'food', 'march', 'again', 'rearing', 'young', 'march', 'again', 'finally', 'return', 'sea.There', 'great', 'deal', 'humour', 'grace', 'penguins', 'are', 'gentle', 'beings', 'vulnerable', 'predators', 'hazards', 'winter', 'being', 'fashioned', 'coldest', 'climates', 'earth', 'nonetheless', 'require', 'warmth', 'particularly', 'eggs', 'hatchlings', 'severe', 'cold', 'far-below-zero', 'windchills', 'many', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'one', 'negative', 'side', 'film', 'was', 'somewhat', 'constant', 'lingering', 'downside', 'part', 'nature', 'still', 'bit', 'more', 'tragic', 'cycle', 'film', 'be', 'billed', 'family', 'film', 'worried', 'children', 'viewing', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'emotionally', 'upset', 'needed', 'be.Still', 'details', 'presented', 'are', 'fascinating', 'true', 'testament', 'filmmaking', 'shots', 'images', 'were', 'captured', 'dramatically', 'humourously', 'gracefully', 'beautifully', 'were.This', 'film', ""'Academy"", 'Award', 'written', 'many', 'categories', 'Cinematography', 'musical', 'score', 'directing', 'documentary', 'are', 'only', 'categories', 'film', 'likely', 'get', 'nod', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'never', 'camera', 'wonderful', 'reading', 'narrator', 'visual', 'feast', 'adding', 'subtle', 'emphasis', 'never', 'often', 'tale', 'English-language', 'version', 'film.Director', 'Luc', 'Jacquet', 'cinematographers', 'Laurent', 'Chalet', 'Jerome', 'Maison', 'have', 'produced', 'masterpiece', 'language', 'barriers', 'indeed', 'native', 'human', 'language', 'Antarctica', 'French', 'team', 'have', 'translated', 'film', 'many', 'languages', 'world', 'people', 'everywhere', 'will', 'find', 'something', 'can', 'relate.Perhaps', 'most', 'skillful', 'part', 'filming', 'was', 'make', 'Antarctica', 'seem', 'so', 'varied', 'texture', 'place', 'continent', 'covered', 'ice', 'snow', 'one', 'still', 'sense', 'length', 'journey', 'beauty', 'inherent', 'surroundings', 'dangers', 'involved', 'penguins.Be', 'sure', 'stay', 'credits', 'one', 'see', 'film', 'crew', 'light-hearted', 'scenes', 'curious', 'penguins']",N/A

640207,A140XH16IKR4B0,B00005JOFZ,Jean E. Pouliot,"[1, 6]","""March of the Penguins"" is delightfully photographed, visually compelling, and often emotionally engaging. It tells the story of the long waddling marches that Emperor Penguins undertake each year to reach their breeding grounds, to mate and to care for their young. Living at what seems like the absolute margins of conditions hospitable to life, these beautiful animals display a range of adaptations (plumage, care of the young, temporary monogamy) that are fascinating. It doesn't hurt that penguins are funny-looking, generally harmless and their chicks are adorable fuzzballs.Still, this is a hard movie to rate. If you're a little kid (5-10) or an adult with no particularly interest in the science of animal behavior, you will adore it. Others will find less than in the movie than meets the eye. The title for this review comes from my 16-year-old, who (like me and the rest of the family) found the film beautiful to watch but leaving us with nothing to talk about afterwards.The rest of the review catalogs some of the movie's failings, so stop here if you are a diehard fan!""March of the Penguins"" is a perfect movie for the current American anti-scientific and hyper-moral climate. It's a movie with practically no sex, no mention of the E-word (evolution) but preaching pro-family values -- that is, if you are a primate, specifically a human one. You will see funny shots of penguins slipping on ice and sliding on their bellies, but never learn how long they live. You will see the death of an egg or two but never learn how many eggs are lost to freezing, inept parents, theft or predation. You will see penguin couples seem to cuddle with their monogamous partners, but have no insight into the nature of their bond. You will see mothers ""grieving"" for their young, but not learn to what degree penguins are capable of emotions, at least in the human sense of the word. And you will certainly not be challenged to consider the degree to which *human* emotions are based in biology rather than morality. Speaking of morality, the movie, subtitled ""Love Finds a Way"" is practically a faunal sermon on the virtues of heterosexual monogamy. One wonders how much film was expended in the effort to depict penguins appearing to fulfill human ideals.Still, the film is worth seeing, if only to witness the grand excesses to which earthly life will go in order to propagate itself. And it's not often that we can witness 9 straight months of life in the Antarctic. Morgan Freeman's sonorous narration is suitably grave for the subject. The musical accompaniment is often moving, and only occasionally overblown, as with the accompaniment to the very brief scene of penguins mating. The score at this point was so vibrantly and earnestly ethereal that it seemed penguin sex was the apotheosis of human experience.""March of the Penguins"" is not a movie you will regret viewing, but it may well leave you hoping that ""Animal Planet"" gives the Emperor Penguin a more thorough treatment.",3,Breathtaking but not mind-boggling,1123459200,"08 8, 2005",2005,2992,"['March', 'Penguins', 'delightfully', 'photographed', 'visually', 'compelling', 'often', 'emotionally', 'engaging', 'story', 'long', 'waddling', 'marches', 'Emperor', 'Penguins', 'undertake', 'year', 'reach', 'breeding', 'grounds', 'mate', 'care', 'young', 'Living', 'what', 'absolute', 'margins', 'conditions', 'hospitable', 'life', 'beautiful', 'animals', 'display', 'range', 'adaptations', 'plumage', 'care', 'young', 'temporary', 'monogamy', 'are', 'fascinating', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'penguins', 'are', 'funny-looking', 'generally', 'harmless', 'chicks', 'are', 'adorable', 'fuzzballs.Still', 'hard', 'movie', 'rate', ""'re"", 'little', 'kid', '5-10', 'adult', 'particularly', 'interest', 'science', 'animal', 'behavior', 'will', 'adore', 'Others', 'will', 'find', 'less', 'movie', 'eye', 'title', 'review', '16-year-old', 'who', 'rest', 'family', 'found', 'film', 'beautiful', 'watch', 'leaving', 'nothing', 'talk', 'afterwards.The', 'rest', 'review', 'catalogs', 'movie', 'failings', 'so', 'stop', 'here', 'are', 'diehard', 'fan', 'March', 'Penguins', 'perfect', 'movie', 'current', 'American', 'anti-scientific', 'hyper-moral', 'climate', 'movie', 'practically', 'sex', 'mention', 'E-word', 'evolution', 'preaching', 'pro-family', 'values', 'are', 'primate', 'specifically', 'human', 'one', 'will', 'see', 'funny', 'shots', 'penguins', 'slipping', 'ice', 'sliding', 'bellies', 'never', 'learn', 'how', 'long', 'live', 'will', 'see', 'death', 'egg', 'two', 'never', 'learn', 'how', 'many', 'eggs', 'are', 'lost', 'freezing', 'inept', 'parents', 'theft', 'predation', 'will', 'see', 'penguin', 'couples', 'seem', 'cuddle', 'monogamous', 'partners', 'have', 'insight', 'nature', 'bond', 'will', 'see', 'mothers', 'grieving', 'young', 'not', 'learn', 'what', 'degree', 'penguins', 'are', 'capable', 'emotions', 'least', 'human', 'sense', 'word', 'will', 'certainly', 'not', 'be', 'challenged', 'consider', 'degree', '*human*', 'emotions', 'are', 'based', 'biology', 'rather', 'morality', 'Speaking', 'morality', 'movie', 'subtitled', 'Love', 'Way', 'practically', 'faunal', 'sermon', 'virtues', 'heterosexual', 'monogamy', 'One', 'how', 'much', 'film', 'was', 'expended', 'effort', 'depict', 'penguins', 'appearing', 'fulfill', 'human', 'ideals.Still', 'film', 'worth', 'seeing', 'only', 'witness', 'grand', 'excesses', 'earthly', 'life', 'will', 'go', 'order', 'propagate', 'not', 'often', 'can', 'witness', '9', 'straight', 'months', 'life', 'Antarctic', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'sonorous', 'narration', 'suitably', 'grave', 'subject', 'musical', 'accompaniment', 'often', 'moving', 'only', 'occasionally', 'overblown', 'accompaniment', 'very', 'brief', 'scene', 'penguins', 'mating', 'score', 'point', 'was', 'so', 'vibrantly', 'earnestly', 'ethereal', 'seemed', 'penguin', 'sex', 'was', 'apotheosis', 'human', 'experience', 'March', 'Penguins', 'not', 'movie', 'will', 'regret', 'viewing', 'may', 'well', 'leave', 'hoping', 'Animal', 'Planet', 'Emperor', 'Penguin', 'more', 'thorough', 'treatment']",N/A

Director Luc Jacquet and his superb team of cinematographers and photographers deserve ample credit for making an engaging, compelling documentary film devoted to the life history of the Emperor Penguin, focusing on a small population of penguins somewhere near the coast on the continent of Antarctica. Although the film's main theme is the life and death struggle of adult Emperor Penguins to reproduce successfully, there is also ample cinematography devoted to Antarctica itself, showing the primordial beauty of this desolate, ice-encased continent. Morgan Freeman's eloquent commentary is superbly succinct, without sounding a bit pompous or morose. Those viewers thinking of bringing their young children to see this film should prepare them for some violent imagery, since there are a few frightening scenes of penguins freezing to death, and being hunted by predators. with one memorably horrible scene of a leopard seal stalking and capturing a female adult penguin.

Emperor penguins in their thousands abandon the deep blue security of their ocean home and clamber onto the frozen ice to begin their long journey into a region so bleak, so extreme, it supports no other wildlife at this time of year. In single file, the penguins march blinded by blizzards, buffeted by gale force winds. Guided by instinct, by the otherworldly radiance of the Southern Cross, they head unerringly for their traditional breeding ground where--after a ritual courtship of intricate dances and delicate maneuvering, accompanied by a cacophony of ecstatic song--they will pair off into monogamous couples and mate. The females remain long enough only to lay a single egg. Once this is accomplished, exhausted by weeks without nourishment, they begin their return journey across the ice-field to the fish-filled seas. The male emperors are left behind to guard and hatch the precious eggs, which they cradle at all times on top of their feet. After two long months during which the males eat nothing, the eggs begin to hatch. Once they have emerged into their ghostly white new world, the chicks can not survive for long on their fathers' limited food reserves. If their mothers are late returning from the ocean with food, the newly-hatched young will die. Once the families are reunited, the roles reverse, the mothers remaining with their new young while their mates head, exhausted and starved, for the sea, and food. While the adults fish, the chicks face the ever-present threat of attack by prowling giant petrels. As the weather grows warmer and the ice floes finally begin to crack and melt, the adults will repeat their arduous journey countless times, marching many hundreds of miles over some of the most treacherous territory on Earth, until the chicks are ready to take their first faltering dive into the deep blue waters of the Antarctic.Luc Jacqet has created a emotional, masterful documtary that chrocnicles Emperor penquins' struggle to mate, and have a child and a family, while baring the obstecles that get in the way of it. He takes the animals and makes you feel for them. He showcases the struggles of those animals beautifully, showing that animalkind and mankind have their struggles and need to over come them. He takes the direction and throws the Emperor pequin's lives into your faces and shows you what they have to go through on a day to day grind in order to survive. He shows the ups and downs of pequins' lives and makes you feel for them as if they were humans. It was saddening to see what was happening to them and made me feel.Jordan Robert's narration and Morgan Freeman's execution of it really helped us understand what was going on. They described what was happening to them in a way that we were informed of what was happening. Also, Morgan Freeman was the perfect person to narrate because he has the voice and the power behind it to carry a film with his words. They basically didn't just tell us what happened on the screen, but they did it with such a emotion and sincerity that made us feel for those animals. Freeman also mastered saying something somber or something cheerful wherever it appeared on the screen.The music by Alex Wurman was brillant. It fit every situation perfectly and wonderfully. He added somber music for all the sad moments and cheerful music for all the wonderful parts. He really took the film places with his music because I feel that it would be less enjoyable without the music that he had composed.The film was a great documtary that had you feeling all kinds of emotional feelings. You want to jump up for joy in your seat when the pequins go home or when they come together as a family. This was a truely wonderful and remarkable film. You are mermerized by what is going on the screen and you are amazed by the wonderful cinetography and landscapes of a cold harsh world. I enjoyed it with my family.

640210,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B00005JOFZ,Joseph Haschka,"[1, 3]","A couple of years back, filmgoers were offered the magnificent and exquisitely photographed WINGED MIGRATION. Don't go to MARCH OF THE PENGUINS expecting something comparable.Narrated by one of the most recognizable voices in the movie industry, Morgan Freeman, this documentary by National Geographic Feature Films follows a year in the life of Emperor penguins in the Antarctic. The story begins in March, the Southern Hemisphere's Fall season, when the birds leave the sea and take to the ice, trudging (up to) seventy miles to their ancestral breeding grounds. There, males and females pair off into monogamous couples. After the female produces a single egg, she leaves it in the custody of the male while she treks back to the sea where she'll feed during the worst of the winter, getting enough food to take back to her young chick, which hatches as the sun again peeps over the horizon after days of total darkness. Once having returned, the mother takes up guardianship of the hatchling while the father, now having gone without food for several months, makes the arduous journey back to the ocean for groceries. This cycle repeats until November, when the melting of ice flows brings the shoreline closer to the breeding grounds. Eventually, in the Antarctic summer, adults and their offspring all return to the water.Whereas WINGED MIGRATION followed several bird species over intercontinental distances to and from varied and exotic locales, MARCH OF THE PENGUINS is necessarily narrower in scope. And most of the latter film takes place on the ground; there aren't the stunning visuals of birds in flight as in the former. In any case, MARCH didn't elicit from me any soto voce exclamations of ""Wow!"" or ""Way cool!"". However, as the film did (perhaps) excessively anthropomorphize the feelings of the penguin mates to each other and their attachment to the egg and subsequent chick, especially as verbally described by the dulcet Freeman, there were several outburst of ""Awwwwwww"" from other members of the audience.I don't wish to denigrate the achievement of the French production team, headed by director Luc Jacquet, in creating this fine documentary under (presumably) harsh conditions. It's only in the end credits that we see brief snippets of the film crew on location with their cameras. (For all I know, they could've been working out of a heated Quonset hut with all the amenities just out of camera frame.) Indeed, the underwater and under-ice sequences of hunting and feeding penguins are perhaps the most impressive on the reel.

This one will have the kids begging to see it again and again - and with good reason (I wanted to see it again too).The plot, such as it is, involves the real-life struggle of the Emperor penguins as they wander through the coldest part of the world, where temperatures can reach minus 50 degrees.Their goal? To find a mate and, hopefully, create a new life.But to reach that goal, some must fall along the way and the rest must persevere in the most difficult of circumstances, weathering blizzards, predators and the constant struggle for food.Although I found the penguins endearing (as did the children in our family) this might be a bit too intense for young children who are extremely sensitive, since there are some life and death struggles, not all of them with happy endings. So trust your judgment on this or just see the film once before taking a younger child.I don't want to give away the plot but there are some heartbreaking scenes as well as some that moved me to tears, including the loving and tender moments between the penguins and their babies. But again, the painful moments may be too intense for the youngest children. It is, however, a film that everyone should see at least once in their lifetime, if not many times.

640213,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B00005JOFZ,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[9, 10]","In the harshest environment in the world, Antarctica, an amazing gathering accumulates once a year in the name of love.  This love is for the purpose of continued survival, as it demands a vast number of the largest penguins in the world, the Emperor penguin, to wander across the snowy and icy desert where minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit could be considered a warm day at the beach.  These penguins, which could reach a height of four feet, travel up to 70 miles on wobbly stumpy legs and do belly slides in order to reach the point where their species has met for mating through several millennia.It is a long journey that the penguins undertake to find a mate for one single season with whom they strive to nurture one egg into a new hatched life.  This is a journey that could easily cost the penguins' lives, as freezing weather selects those who have fallen behind, or commenced their journey too late, to fall under bone-chilling gales and blizzards.  Through the opportunity to observe these penguins a notion rises that the penguins must coexists with nature in a delicate balance where life and death weigh equal.  Death cannot be considered a cruel enemy stalking them for the purpose of evil, but as an opportunity for natural selection to take its course and strengthen the Emperor penguins position in nature.From the safe distance of an air conditioned theater the audience can observe several penguins struggling for survival.  It is a rough cinematic journey to see these penguins struggling for survival against the freezing weather, starvation, and predators.  In some aspects, it even seems absurd in the perspective of a being a human.  Yet, it is within the illogical reasoning out of a humans point of view that mankind must realize its powerful position in the global ecosystem.  Humans have over an extended time continued to destroy nature in a progressive manner through exploitation, toxic waste disposal, and other natural disasters created by man, which many parts of the human society still deny.  The aftermath could change the environmental balance for the penguins, and only a slight change could have a disastrous effect on the existence of the Emperor penguin.  The film does not deal directly with mankind's influence on nature, but the notion lingers throughout the film.Once the penguins reached the location of mating it is hard to believe that love can take place in such a place where natural selection and death are as common as snow.  Through extensive courtship the females pick their mating male with whom they attempt to have an egg.  When the egg is delivered the female teaches the male how to handle the egg, as the body heat from the penguin is the only thing that keeps the chick safe inside the egg.  One prolonged scene, displays the repercussion of careless penguin couple, as the egg slowly breaks from the freezing temperatures.  The painful images of watching the egg break continue to stir in the mind of the audience, as the male penguins are left to care for the eggs while the females return to the ocean to get food for the soon hatched chick.Morgan Freeman's voice narrates the American version with tactfulness and objectivity to the many situations.  There are moments that will bring laughter through cute tumbling penguins while other scenes will slash through the heart with agonizing sorrow.  Watching the penguins huddling together for heat, feeding the chicks, and wandering together illustrates a very compassionate atmosphere, even if it is freezing.  There are also genuine moments of care and affection delivered between the penguins, which could be felt all the way into the hearts of the viewers.  The iciness of Antarctica cannot overpower the love that the Emperor penguin has for life, as this film will genuinely stir the emotions and notions within the audience in many different ways.",5,Icy Brilliant Narrative of Antarctic Love...,1121817600,"07 20, 2005",2005,3865,"['harshest', 'environment', 'world', 'Antarctica', 'amazing', 'gathering', 'once', 'year', 'name', 'love', 'love', 'purpose', 'continued', 'survival', 'vast', 'number', 'largest', 'penguins', 'world', 'Emperor', 'penguin', 'wander', 'snowy', 'icy', 'desert', 'where', 'minus', '50', 'degrees', 'Fahrenheit', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'warm', 'day', 'beach', 'penguins', 'could', 'reach', 'height', 'four', 'feet', 'travel', 'up', '70', 'miles', 'wobbly', 'stumpy', 'legs', 'do', 'belly', 'slides', 'order', 'reach', 'point', 'where', 'species', 'met', 'mating', 'several', 'millennia.It', 'long', 'journey', 'penguins', 'undertake', 'find', 'mate', 'one', 'single', 'season', 'whom', 'strive', 'nurture', 'one', 'egg', 'new', 'hatched', 'life', 'journey', 'could', 'easily', 'cost', 'penguins', 'lives', 'freezing', 'weather', 'selects', 'who', 'have', 'fallen', 'commenced', 'journey', 'too', 'late', 'fall', 'bone-chilling', 'gales', 'blizzards', 'opportunity', 'observe', 'penguins', 'notion', 'penguins', 'must', 'coexists', 'nature', 'delicate', 'balance', 'where', 'life', 'death', 'weigh', 'equal', 'Death', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'considered', 'cruel', 'enemy', 'stalking', 'purpose', 'evil', 'opportunity', 'natural', 'selection', 'take', 'course', 'strengthen', 'Emperor', 'position', 'safe', 'distance', 'air', 'conditioned', 'audience', 'can', 'observe', 'several', 'penguins', 'struggling', 'survival', 'rough', 'cinematic', 'journey', 'see', 'penguins', 'struggling', 'survival', 'freezing', 'weather', 'starvation', 'predators', 'aspects', 'even', 'absurd', 'perspective', 'being', 'human', 'illogical', 'reasoning', 'humans', 'point', 'view', 'mankind', 'must', 'realize', 'powerful', 'position', 'global', 'ecosystem', 'Humans', 'have', 'extended', 'time', 'continued', 'destroy', 'nature', 'progressive', 'manner', 'exploitation', 'toxic', 'waste', 'disposal', 'other', 'natural', 'disasters', 'created', 'man', 'many', 'parts', 'human', 'society', 'still', 'deny', 'aftermath', 'could', 'change', 'environmental', 'balance', 'penguins', 'only', 'slight', 'change', 'could', 'have', 'disastrous', 'effect', 'existence', 'Emperor', 'penguin', 'film', 'not', 'deal', 'directly', 'mankind', 'influence', 'nature', 'notion', 'lingers', 'film.Once', 'penguins', 'reached', 'location', 'mating', 'hard', 'believe', 'love', 'can', 'take', 'place', 'place', 'where', 'natural', 'selection', 'death', 'are', 'as', 'common', 'snow', 'extensive', 'courtship', 'females', 'pick', 'mating', 'male', 'whom', 'attempt', 'have', 'egg', 'When', 'egg', 'delivered', 'female', 'male', 'how', 'handle', 'egg', 'body', 'heat', 'penguin', 'only', 'thing', 'chick', 'safe', 'egg', 'One', 'prolonged', 'scene', 'repercussion', 'careless', 'penguin', 'couple', 'egg', 'slowly', 'freezing', 'temperatures', 'painful', 'images', 'watching', 'egg', 'break', 'continue', 'stir', 'mind', 'audience', 'male', 'penguins', 'are', 'left', 'care', 'eggs', 'females', 'return', 'ocean', 'get', 'food', 'soon', 'hatched', 'chick.Morgan', 'Freeman', 'voice', 'American', 'version', 'tactfulness', 'objectivity', 'many', 'situations', 'are', 'moments', 'will', 'bring', 'laughter', 'cute', 'tumbling', 'penguins', 'other', 'scenes', 'will', 'slash', 'heart', 'agonizing', 'sorrow', 'Watching', 'penguins', 'huddling', 'together', 'heat', 'feeding', 'chicks', 'wandering', 'together', 'very', 'compassionate', 'atmosphere', 'even', 'freezing', 'are', 'also', 'genuine', 'moments', 'care', 'affection', 'delivered', 'penguins', 'could', 'be', 'felt', 'way', 'hearts', 'viewers', 'iciness', 'Antarctica', 'can', 'not', 'overpower', 'love', 'Emperor', 'penguin', 'life', 'film', 'will', 'genuinely', 'stir', 'emotions', 'notions', 'audience', 'many', 'different', 'ways']",N/A

It is an amazing story: each year, as the Antarctic ""summer"" comes to an end, the penguins leave the water and march inland seventy miles to their breeding grounds. There they mate and, after each couple produces a single egg, the females return to the sea, leaving the males to incubate the egg and see it through to hatching. By the time the mothers return to feed their newborn chicks, the fathers have not eaten for several months.The visual images that trace this tale are breathtaking--the background shots of the frozen wilds of the continent are enthralling enough, but there are also some incredible underwater shots, taken via submarine. Though Morgan Freeman intones the narration with impeccable poise, one occasionally wishes that this almost unbelievable story of natural survival against the harshest of odds had been allowed to speak more for itself.  Of course penguins are cute and it's hard to resist the occasional anthropomorphic bit of comedy or romance, but overall the film could have done more to emphasize the magnitude of the struggle, though admittedly there's no way one can actually feel how cold that Antarctic winter must be as hurricane force winds threaten to bury the huddled male penguins under snowdrifts. Still, enough of the experience comes through to inspire awe at the eternal resilience of nature.

Yes, it was wise to release this French documentary in mid summer in the U.S.  The film is doing well and I'm sure the weather here has something to do with it.  Personally though, I would have made it a point to see this film anyway.  I'm a lover of all things to do with the frozen regions of the world.  Perhaps it's because the harsh conditions inflicted on humans is such a contrast to my own comfortable life.This documentary, sponsored by National Geographic, was produced by a team of French filmmakers.  The American version is narrated by the familiar voice of Morgan Freeman, who we never see.  In fact we never see any human beings at all until the closing credits which include a few film clips of the crew at work.  Therefore, the stars of this film are first and foremost the real-life penguins on their annual pilgrimage to fulfill their evolutionary need to reproduce.  This is a scene that repeats itself every year too.  And it is a testament to the perseverance of these creatures who have adapted to the most difficult conditions on earth and have survived for millions of years.Every year, as the summer ends and the harsh winter begins, all the penguins walk 70 miles to their breeding grounds.  They have been eating well all summer and that's a good thing.  It will be a long time till they can eat again.  The breeding ground is where the ice is thickest but it is not any more protected than the rest the region, subject to blizzards and storms and temperatures that can go as low as 100 degrees below zero.  The penguins each chose a mate and will be monogamous for the next eight months.  The female produces an egg but in sub-zero conditions this egg will freeze if not protected.  Very carefully, she passes the egg on to the male, who will keep the egg warm while she walks back 70 miles to feed and bring food to the newborn when it is born.I sat there transfixed at this unique way that the penguins have of protecting their species.  I gained a new appreciation of them and for nature itself.  And I learned things about the penguins that I had never known before.  The script was excellent and the cinematography of the highest quality.  There's humor and pathos and a very original story.  I just loved this film and recommend it for everyone.  Try not to miss it.  And it's especially delightful if you see it on a hot day.",5,The rigors of survival of a species. Much to learn.

Once there, they pair up and will be faithful to each other for the duration of the season.  The female lays the egg, the male keeps it warm.  Then the females return to the water to get food.  Upon their return, the eggs have hatched, and it is the males turn to go get food.  The couple continue on this path until the chicks are developed enough to be left on their own.

640218,A1FG91CM8221X1,B00005JOFZ,Miles D. Moore,"[1, 1]","The ad campaign for Luc Jacquet's brilliant ""March of the Penguins"" is slightly misleading, as is its ""G"" rating. This film by rights should be ""PG,"" because the scenes of penguins beset by fierce Antarctic storms and even fiercer predators would be extremely upsetting to very small children. Like the death of Bambi's mother and the donkey-boys in ""Pinocchio,"" the sight of baby penguins chased by hungry gooney birds will create untold numbers of screaming nightmares for generations of three- and four-year-olds. ""March of the Penguins"" is a family film only for families whose children are old enough to understand that the course of nature includes tragedy and death. That said, it's an awe-inspiring, uniquely moving and uplifting film, full of ""How did they film that?"" cinematic moments and bolstered by a haunting music score. By showing us the incredible hardships that emperor penguins endure in order to survive and propagate, Jacquet reclaims for us a little-known phenomenon of the natural world, and fills us with admiration and love for some of the noblest, bravest, most endearing creatures on God's earth. Jacquet wisely avoids trying to personalize the penguins, a' la Disney documentaries, but Morgan Freeman's narration can't help ascribing human emotions of courage, sorrow and joy to the penguins (and, indeed, forgoing such anthromorphization would have taken superhuman effort, considering what the penguins go through). Be sure to stay for the final credits, which show the hardships that Jacquet and his crew endured, as well as charming scenes of the human filmmakers interacting with the ever-curious penguins. But be warned: if you take your younger children to see this film, be prepared to invest in a night light, and to spend the wee hours comforting sons and daughters who just dreamed a seal was about to eat them.",5,"A brilliant nature documentary, but not really a ""family film.""",1124755200,"08 23, 2005",2005,1851,"['ad', 'campaign', 'Luc', 'Jacquet', 'brilliant', 'March', 'Penguins', 'slightly', 'misleading', 'G', 'rating', 'film', 'rights', 'should', 'be', 'PG', 'scenes', 'penguins', 'beset', 'fierce', 'Antarctic', 'storms', 'even', 'fiercer', 'predators', 'would', 'be', 'extremely', 'upsetting', 'very', 'small', 'children', 'death', 'Bambi', 'mother', 'donkey-boys', 'Pinocchio', 'sight', 'baby', 'penguins', 'chased', 'hungry', 'gooney', 'birds', 'will', 'create', 'untold', 'numbers', 'screaming', 'nightmares', 'generations', 'three-', 'four-year-olds', 'March', 'Penguins', 'family', 'film', 'only', 'families', 'children', 'are', 'old', 'enough', 'understand', 'course', 'nature', 'tragedy', 'death', 'said', 'awe-inspiring', 'uniquely', 'moving', 'uplifting', 'film', 'full', 'How', 'did', 'film', 'cinematic', 'moments', 'bolstered', 'haunting', 'music', 'score', 'showing', 'incredible', 'hardships', 'emperor', 'endure', 'order', 'survive', 'propagate', 'Jacquet', 'little-known', 'phenomenon', 'natural', 'world', 'admiration', 'love', 'noblest', 'bravest', 'most', 'endearing', 'creatures', 'God', 'earth', 'Jacquet', 'wisely', 'trying', 'personalize', 'penguins', 'la', 'Disney', 'documentaries', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'narration', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'ascribing', 'human', 'emotions', 'courage', 'sorrow', 'joy', 'penguins', 'indeed', 'forgoing', 'such', 'anthromorphization', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'superhuman', 'effort', 'considering', 'what', 'penguins', 'go', 'Be', 'sure', 'stay', 'final', 'credits', 'show', 'hardships', 'Jacquet', 'crew', 'endured', 'as', 'well', 'charming', 'scenes', 'human', 'filmmakers', 'interacting', 'ever-curious', 'penguins', 'be', 'warned', 'take', 'younger', 'children', 'see', 'film', 'be', 'prepared', 'invest', 'night', 'light', 'spend', 'wee', 'hours', 'comforting', 'sons', 'daughters', 'who', 'just', 'dreamed', 'seal', 'was', 'eat']",N/A

Therefore, I must say that I was disappointed with the film.  I expected a clean, G-rated, educational film that had some unique features within an actual story.  I also expected some outstanding photography of the antarctic scenery.Unfortunately, this film is a typical nature documentary; it is very similar to what you find on the Discovery channel or PBS.  I'm not really sure what the point is of having it on the big screen.  I like Discovery channel nature documentaries, so I liked this film, but it was nothing special.  It was really no better than dozens of other documentaries.Morgan Freedman, who I like, gives a typical documentary narrative and doesn't add any humor or interest to the film.  He gives a workman-like performance.  The film also lacks impressive filming.  For instance, there is no neat underwater photography and the landscape lacks the beauty of other documentaries.  For the technical viewer, there are no maps or charts showing locations and survival rates.  For those searching for some type of story, there is none.  We don't follow a particular penguin couple through the process or keep an eye on one newborn.

There really isn't any plot, as this is a documentary film on these birds, how they live and survive.  But there is a cycle of nature.  It's really amazing how those birds can endure the march back and forth 70 miles by foot; with the way they walk, it must take forever!Once they reach to the breeding ground, they go on without eating for 3-4 months.  The males have to keep the eggs safe and warm while the females march 70 miles back to the water to feed themselves.  The storms come one after another, and they have to stand and protect the eggs (can't lie down or fall asleep), and there is absolutely nothing to protect them.  It is painful to watch the males stick closely together in the storm for survival, as the wind blows almost 100 miles per hour.  When the wind gets too harsh, the tight bundle of birds gets blown apart and the birds cry out in pain.  That was the hardest part to watch.  And finally when the eggs hatch and the babies are born, they have no food to give to the new-borns.  They're just patiently waiting for the females to come back.  Some birds die, female, male, and the new-borns alike during this time, and the loss is unbearable.But when the storm is over and they hear and see the females come back, there is a great stir of joy and victory among the male community.  It was absolutely moving.Helpless and vulnerable as they are, they have great endurance and courage, and they're strong creatures.The film beautifully captures the tender moments so unique and precious, and it is done with superb artistry.  I can't imagine the difficulties that the film crews had to go through, but it was well worth it.  It's one of the most beautiful films I have ever watched.The music is good too.  It reminded me of Bolling's jazz/classic cross-over.  There is no humans in this film; the focus is solely on the Penguins.  A lot of tender moments, a lot of humorous moments, a lot of endurance and perseverance, these birds are truly noble creatures (so are the people who filmed them!).

MARCH OF THE PENGUINS follows the last tribal groups to exist on this ice cap terrain, the Emperor Penguins, as their natural progression of life is captured and narrated by Morgan Freeman.  Despite its comparison to WINGED MIGRATION, this is by far different in that this a subtle observation of the Emperor Penguins who remain in their natural habitat without venturing off on a worldwide trek in order to avoid the cold season; they tread through it through out their life. The film brings back memories of the Wonderful World of Disney where the animal world is showcased for all to see.  Director Luc Jacquet presents a unique documentary that captures the natural beauty of the cycle of life of this particular group of penguins - the joy of life with their meeting and mating ritual to their loss of life, and the reoccurring cycle that starts back to the beginning.The cinematography and photography of MARCH OF THE PENGUINS is exceptional.  Luc Jacquet and his crew appear to have gone through some grueling sessions, such as the winter snowstorm where the penguins huddle together in order keep warm and as well as to show various changes of seasons that the Emperor Penguin has to endure.  The most captivating footage appears during the evening, which shows one of the penguins gazing at the Aurora Borealis or Northern Lights amidst the darkened sky.  In addition, the film's soundtrack and the unforgettable main theme scored by Alex Wurman compliment the various scenes of the film.Indeed, MARCH OF THE PENGUINS is one of those rare films that the entire family will enjoy as well as anyone who would like to gain insight on how our animal neighbors live and survive.",5,Cool and Refreshing Film,1124409600,"08 19, 2005",2005,1777,"['waddle', 'glide', 'bellies', 'make', 'trek', 'Antarctic', 'landscape', 'MARCH', 'THE', 'PENGUINS', 'last', 'tribal', 'groups', 'exist', 'ice', 'cap', 'terrain', 'Emperor', 'Penguins', 'natural', 'progression', 'life', 'captured', 'narrated', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'comparison', 'WINGED', 'MIGRATION', 'far', 'different', 'subtle', 'observation', 'Emperor', 'Penguins', 'who', 'remain', 'natural', 'habitat', 'venturing', 'off', 'worldwide', 'trek', 'order', 'avoid', 'cold', 'season', 'tread', 'out', 'life', 'film', 'back', 'memories', 'Wonderful', 'World', 'Disney', 'where', 'animal', 'world', 'showcased', 'see', 'Director', 'Luc', 'Jacquet', 'unique', 'documentary', 'natural', 'beauty', 'cycle', 'life', 'particular', 'group', 'penguins', 'joy', 'life', 'meeting', 'mating', 'ritual', 'loss', 'life', 'reoccurring', 'cycle', 'back', 'beginning.The', 'cinematography', 'photography', 'MARCH', 'THE', 'PENGUINS', 'exceptional', 'Luc', 'Jacquet', 'crew', 'appear', 'have', 'gone', 'grueling', 'sessions', 'such', 'winter', 'snowstorm', 'where', 'penguins', 'huddle', 'together', 'order', 'keep', 'warm', 'as', 'well', 'show', 'various', 'changes', 'seasons', 'Emperor', 'Penguin', 'endure', 'most', 'captivating', 'footage', 'evening', 'one', 'penguins', 'gazing', 'Aurora', 'Borealis', 'Northern', 'Lights', 'amidst', 'darkened', 'sky', 'addition', 'film', 'soundtrack', 'unforgettable', 'main', 'theme', 'scored', 'Alex', 'Wurman', 'compliment', 'various', 'scenes', 'film.Indeed', 'MARCH', 'THE', 'PENGUINS', 'one', 'rare', 'films', 'entire', 'family', 'will', 'enjoy', 'as', 'well', 'anyone', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'gain', 'insight', 'how', 'animal', 'neighbors', 'live', 'survive']",N/A

640224,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B00005JOFZ,RMurray847,"[2, 2]","This movie is pretty much review-proof, in my opinion.  What can you criticize?  The way the story turns out?  How the penguins look?  What they do?  This is the kind of documentary that essentially turns its cameras on its subjects and lets us look.  In this case, the subject is the Emperor Penguin, and their amazing, ridiculous annual rite of reproduction and child-rearing.  We can only marvel at what evolution has forced them to endure.They are amazing creatures...no question.  One reason the movie has succeeded to well is that penguins are easy to anthropomorphize...to impose human traits on.  Heck, even the narration (ably provided by Morgan Freeman) says that this is a story of ""love.""  If you want to believe that animals can ""love,"" then you're REALLY going to find many of the events of the film heartbreaking.I won't go into the details of the ""March,"" but suffice it to say that these penguins put themselves through hell...a VERY cold hell...just to have a chance to reproduce.  There are lots of laughs to be had...watching them make their ways across miles of ice, laughing at the antics of the babies, etc.  But there are more tears...lots of penguins, young and old, don't come out of the end of this movie alive.  It's poignant and amazing and it also induces head-scratching.  You can't help but think they could do things better.  Part of their behavior, as far as traveling to the same place inland year after year, has been hardwired into them.  But you have to wonder if when this all first started, the place they trekked to wasn't closer to the ocean (where they go for food).  Antarctica is constantly changing.  Couldn't the penguins find a new place to seek some modest shelter?  In some ways, they are like Salmon swimming upstream to spawn and die at the place they were born.  If that darn salmon just wasn't so insistent on going to the EXACT spot...it would be much more likely to spawn AND survive to spawn another year.Anyway, the other amazing part of the film is the work of the documentary crew.  Be sure to stay through the closing credits, where you get to see them at work for the first time.  In the film, there are some amazing ""up-above"" shots that one can't help but wonder at how they were accomplished.  You'll see how at the end.MARCH OF THE PENGUINS is getting a lot of hype for being a family-film.  My family certainly enjoyed it...but for young children, I think it will be a bore.  We saw it on a Saturday afternoon, and there were probably 50 kids in the audience under 8 years old.  Most of them were quite restless, talking loud, asking questions, running up and down the aisles.  It's a slow paced film, and very mono-chromatic.  White, gray, black.  While fascinating...I think the details of these creature's lives will not immediately draw in the youngest viewer.  And kids today really don't ""get"" documentaries.  They seem to want SHREK or THE INCREDIBLES.  This lovely, stately, powerful movie is NOT that.  So, a word to the wise.But the movie, as skewed towards humanizing its subjects as it is, is well worth seeing.  (A reviewer below implied that you could see the same on PBS for free any day...unless you've got a screen the size of a movie-theatre screen, you should see this film at a theater.  Also, while it's true that PBS has great documentaries...I think the scope and challenge of filming this one is a bit beyond what NOVA or National Geographic can muster up routinely.)

640225,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B00005JOFZ,Robert I. Hedges,"[26, 27]","""March of the Penguins"" is the best film I have seen this year. The story is essentially one of the drive of Emperor penguins to reproduce in the harshest conditions imaginable. The film is wonderfully narrated by Morgan Freeman, and is equally beautiful, exciting, and sad. Any true-to-life nature documentary is bound to have uplifting and triumphant moments, and this movie is full of them. The sheer determination of the penguins to raise their chicks against insurmountable odds is amazing and inspirational: at times the birds seem almost human in their range of emotions and behaviors.Of course, any realistic nature documentary also has sad moments, and this film is no exception: in an environment as harsh as Antarctica some of the penguins don't survive the rigors of the winter, and when that happens it is almost unbearable to watch the seemingly human emotions and reactions of the survivors.The photography and cinematography are utterly amazing and my hat is off to Luc Jacquet and crew for braving the elements to capture this rarely seen and touching spectacle on film and bringing it to the big screen. Some younger children may be upset by the deaths scenes of the penguins (and they are genuinely heartbreaking), even though I think Jacquet did a good job of explaining it as part of the natural life cycle.This is a beautiful and memorable film that must really be seen in the theater to fully appreciate. I recommend it highly to everyone except especially young and sensitive children.

640226,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JOFZ,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 1]","As informative as it is entertaining, the phenomenally popular documentary ""March of the Penguins"" demonstrates that life can flourish even in the remotest corners and harshest environments on our planet.Director Luc Jacquet and his valiant crew of seasoned filmmakers spent a grueling winter in Antarctica getting up-close-and-personal with a group of penguins who turned out to be anything but shy when the cameras started rolling.  The team recorded the complex mating and child-rearing ritual the penguins have been acting out on their own private little continent, far from the prying eyes of the outside world - until now, that is - for thousands upon thousands of years.  After the penguins have marched seventy miles to their breeding ground, the males and females pair off into monogamous couples to do their thing (fear not, worried parents, the film stays within the pristine parameters of a ""G""-rated, family-friendly feature here).  Then, after the egg has been laid, the male and female trade off responsibility for protecting their progeny against the brutal cold in a fashion that can only make many exhausted mothers in the audience green with envy.  Then we watch as the eggs hatch and the pint-sized young'uns finally get a taste of the challenging life they've been brought into this literally cold, cruel world to lead.Although the photography doesn't have the sparkling clarity one would find in an IMAX film on the same subject, ""March of the Penguins"" still does an amazing job placing us right in the center of the action, be it on the ice as the penguins huddle for warmth against a raging blizzard or under water as the exhausted mothers search for food to bring back to their hungry babies.  The movie is both funny and touching, keeping the inevitable anthropomorphic silliness to a decent minimum.  The narration (voiced by Morgan Freedman) occasionally veers towards the sappy, but, for the most part, it stays levelheaded and informative, while the music ranges from the moving to the soupy.""March of the Penguins"" may be no more than a Discovery Channel feature blown up to big screen proportions, but it's still more fun to watch than most of the fiction films in theaters these days.",4,tribute to nature's spirit of endurance,1124323200,"08 18, 2005",2005,2218,"['As', 'informative', 'entertaining', 'phenomenally', 'popular', 'documentary', 'March', 'Penguins', 'life', 'can', 'flourish', 'even', 'remotest', 'corners', 'harshest', 'environments', 'planet.Director', 'Luc', 'Jacquet', 'valiant', 'crew', 'seasoned', 'filmmakers', 'spent', 'grueling', 'winter', 'Antarctica', 'getting', 'up-close-and-personal', 'group', 'penguins', 'who', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'anything', 'shy', 'when', 'cameras', 'started', 'rolling', 'team', 'recorded', 'complex', 'mating', 'child-rearing', 'ritual', 'penguins', 'have', 'been', 'acting', 'out', 'own', 'private', 'little', 'continent', 'far', 'prying', 'eyes', 'outside', 'world', 'now', 'thousands', 'upon', 'thousands', 'years', 'penguins', 'have', 'marched', 'seventy', 'miles', 'breeding', 'ground', 'males', 'females', 'pair', 'off', 'monogamous', 'couples', 'do', 'thing', 'fear', 'not', 'worried', 'parents', 'film', 'stays', 'pristine', 'parameters', 'G', '-rated', 'family-friendly', 'feature', 'here', 'Then', 'egg', 'been', 'laid', 'male', 'female', 'trade', 'off', 'responsibility', 'protecting', 'progeny', 'brutal', 'cold', 'fashion', 'can', 'only', 'make', 'many', 'exhausted', 'mothers', 'audience', 'green', 'envy', 'Then', 'watch', 'eggs', 'hatch', 'pint-sized', ""young'uns"", 'finally', 'get', 'taste', 'challenging', 'life', ""'ve"", 'been', 'brought', 'literally', 'cold', 'cruel', 'world', 'lead.Although', 'photography', ""n't"", 'have', 'sparkling', 'clarity', 'one', 'would', 'find', 'IMAX', 'film', 'same', 'subject', 'March', 'Penguins', 'still', 'amazing', 'job', 'placing', 'right', 'center', 'action', 'be', 'ice', 'penguins', 'huddle', 'warmth', 'raging', 'blizzard', 'water', 'exhausted', 'mothers', 'search', 'food', 'bring', 'back', 'hungry', 'babies', 'movie', 'funny', 'touching', 'keeping', 'inevitable', 'anthropomorphic', 'silliness', 'decent', 'minimum', 'narration', 'voiced', 'Morgan', 'Freedman', 'occasionally', 'veers', 'towards', 'sappy', 'most', 'part', 'levelheaded', 'informative', 'music', 'moving', 'soupy', 'March', 'Penguins', 'may', 'be', 'no', 'more', 'Discovery', 'Channel', 'feature', 'blown', 'up', 'big', 'screen', 'proportions', 'still', 'more', 'fun', 'watch', 'most', 'fiction', 'films', 'theaters', 'days']",N/A

The photography is outstanding; the narration features a familiar voice; and the story is compelling.  It's a movie you can take your kids to and you and they will learn something you're not likely to forget.My only complaint about the movie is that it doesn't give us quite enough information on the penguins.  How long do they live, for example?  How big are they? What is the rate of reproduction given the horrendous hazards of Antartica?  A little bit more of hard, factual information would have made this a perfect movie.Those fascinated with the penguins might wish to read ""The Worst Journey in the World"" a classic of Antarctic literature which, within its many pages, has a long, frightful story of an overland midwinter journey to collect emperor penguin eggs. Antarctica is a bit tamer these days.  Movie makers can survive the Antarctic winter to make a movie like this.  One hopes that easier access to the penguins also contributes to their survival.

The story of Emperor Penguins, who in March of every year, hop out of the ocean and begin the 70 mile walk (or slide on the stomach) to their well-known breeding ground where the ice is thicker.  If they separate from their group they ""fade away"".  I think this means die.  Then the penguins all meet up with each other and decide on one mate.  Since there are more females than males, the females fight over the males.  However, Morgan Freeman intones that ""most"" of them find a mate.  Where do the extra females go? Do they stick around until the other females go back to the ocean to catch some fish, or do they leave once they see they aren't going to get a mate?  Doesn't say.  Also doesn't say how long it takes them to walk the 70 miles.Once they have mated (doesn't say how many times this takes to ensure a pregnancy) the penguin couples wait (how long?)until an egg shows up.  Then the female rolls it over to the male, and the females take off back to where they came from (all in a group) to catch some fish for themselves and their offspring.  Some of the eggs crack open and freeze before the male can even get a good grip on it, so do those males stick around with the other males, or do they go back with the females?  Doesn't say.So the males group around each other, taking turns being in the middle in this freezing cold. The film shows them standing still, but later walking, then Morgan Freeman says the penguins know if they don't keep walking, they will not survive.  Shows one poor guy wandering around by himself, and Morgan says he will simply ""disappear"".  I think this means die.The eggs hatch, and some poor babies freeze to death.  The females come back and take over and regurgitate fish to feed them.  What happens to the females who come back to a dead baby?  Do they leave again? Doesn't say. The males then head off the 70 miles to feed themselves.  Then they come back.  Again some babies have frozen or been eaten by vultures, while the mommas stand around not doing a heck of a lot.Finally, in October, everyone heads back the 70 miles to their own stomping grounds, and jumps in the ocean, which is their home (although I don't think they can breathe underwater - can they?).  The parents leave the babies standing around not knowing what's going on.  One month later (apparently with nothing to eat this whole time), the babies figure it out, and jump in the ocean too.  Then, four or five years later, they start making the 70 mile trip so that it can happen all over again for their children.Not only is this film depressing, it's about as clear as mud.

Again comes from France another documentary 'March of the Penguins' following the life of Emperor Penguins living in the harshest climate in the world.  To see the beautiful picture of the penguins huddling together for warmth in the middle of the blizzard is an awe-inspiring experience.The film follows one year in the life of Emperor Penguin.  First you will see Emperors traveling to their breeding ground in Antarctica all forming one long dotted line.  After walking (or occasionally gliding) on the white field for more than 70 miles, at their colony they find their partner.  After an egg arrives, the male Emperor remains in the snow for months while the female goes back to the sea to feed herself, and to get food for the baby.There are deaths, and some incredible behaviors of some of the penguins (who lost their eggs), but the film is suitable for family viewing.  I for one didn't like some decisions made though, and one of them is that the film looks slightly too much dramatized (especially when some other animals appear before the penguins).  But I know this film is about the penguins, and from their viewpoints, these animals may look like that.[FRENCH VERSION]  Actually, I haven't seen American version narrated by Morgan Freeman; to write this review I'm referring to the original French version, which turned out not what I expected to see.  In this original version, believe me or not, a male penguin, a female penguin, and their boy penguin are all given a voiceover (by Charles Berling, Romane Bohringer, and child actor Jules Sitruk respectively) as if they are talking.  I can tell you it is very strange, and I really wished to hear Morgan Freeman's voice.  In fact, the effects are often detracting our attention.  (I am a Japanese, and among us the narration is quite unpopular).  Plus, French version has Emilie Simon's quirky pop music sung in English.  I heard the US soundtrack (not all), and find it more suitable to the images.Anyway, whatever the version you are going to see, 'March of the Penguins' is one of the most beatiful pictures this year.

That's when MARCH OF THE PENGUINS became the little picture that could and went on to become the highest-grossing documentary of all time (I don't care how they classify it , FAHRENHEIT 9/11 is not a documentary).MARCH OF THE PENGUINS illustrates a nine-month cycle in the life of Emperor Penguins. Each year these birds trek to the same breeding grounds in Antarctica, battling sub-zero temperatures, bone-chilling winds, and ferocious predators all in the name of love and survival. The Emperor Penguin mating rites are one of love because these penguins remain monogamous to their spouses throughout the mating season, they only separate after it's time to leave their little ones behind.MARCH OF THE PENGUINS is a beautifully filmed picture. It not only captures the beauty of nature, but illustrates its wrath as well. Baby penguins are born, but in the process old penguins die and others are eaten by sea lions. It's a difficult lesson for children to grasp, but it is presented so well in the movie that it teaches children about the survival of a species, but without worrying them unduly.Morgan Freeman narrates the picture and his soulful voice adds a distinct flair. As a piece of trivia, Freeman recorded all of his narration in a single day.I'm a huge fan of penguins and if I had the money and resources, I would own a frozen penguin refuge somewhere. I figured since I couldn't do that the next best thing I could do was to see MARCH OF THE PENGUINS. I absolutely loved it and can't wait to see it again.",5,Story of Love and Survival,1128556800,"10 6, 2005",2005,2266,"['used', 'be', 'time', 'when', 'least', 'one', 'nature', 'documentary', 'was', 'released', 'massive', 'national', 'scale', 'other', 'year', 'Disney', 'used', 'be', 'major', 'Hollywood', 'producer', 'distributor', 'films', 'were', 'so', 'family', 'friendly', 'were', 'other', 'studios', 'independent', 'agencies', 'involved', 'too', 'late', '1970s', 'movies', 'virtually', 'stopped', 'being', 'released', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'STAR', 'WARS', 'film', 'changed', 'everything', 'else', 'business', 'why', 'not', 'nature', 'documentaries', 'too', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'because', 'people', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'animals', 'anymore', 'Whatever', 'reasons', 'major', 'nature', 'documentaries', 'released', 'large', 'scale', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'seen', 'most', 'theatres', 'country', 'long', 'time.Until', 'summer', '2005', 'when', 'MARCH', 'THE', 'PENGUINS', 'became', 'little', 'picture', 'could', 'went', 'become', 'highest-grossing', 'documentary', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'how', 'classify', 'FAHRENHEIT', '9/11', 'not', 'documentary', '.MARCH', 'THE', 'PENGUINS', 'nine-month', 'cycle', 'life', 'Emperor', 'Penguins', 'year', 'birds', 'trek', 'same', 'breeding', 'grounds', 'Antarctica', 'battling', 'sub-zero', 'temperatures', 'bone-chilling', 'winds', 'ferocious', 'predators', 'name', 'love', 'survival', 'Emperor', 'Penguin', 'mating', 'rites', 'are', 'one', 'love', 'penguins', 'remain', 'monogamous', 'spouses', 'mating', 'season', 'only', 'separate', 'time', 'leave', 'little', 'ones', 'behind.MARCH', 'THE', 'PENGUINS', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'picture', 'not', 'only', 'beauty', 'nature', 'wrath', 'well', 'Baby', 'penguins', 'are', 'born', 'process', 'old', 'die', 'others', 'are', 'eaten', 'sea', 'lions', 'difficult', 'lesson', 'children', 'grasp', 'presented', 'so', 'well', 'movie', 'children', 'survival', 'species', 'worrying', 'unduly.Morgan', 'Freeman', 'picture', 'soulful', 'voice', 'distinct', 'flair', 'piece', 'trivia', 'Freeman', 'recorded', 'narration', 'single', 'day.I', ""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'penguins', 'had', 'money', 'resources', 'would', 'own', 'frozen', 'penguin', 'refuge', 'somewhere', 'figured', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'next', 'best', 'thing', 'could', 'do', 'was', 'see', 'MARCH', 'THE', 'PENGUINS', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'again']",N/A

That is this popular documentary's greatest achievement: making one realize the humanity in the creatures some claim have no feelings. Jacqet contradicts such statements with masterfully observed sequences such as a male and female penguin exploring each other's bodies lovingly, almost like youthful teenagers experiencing sex for the first time in some nostalgic summer romance. Additionally, Jacquet skillfully forms a bond between audience and subject through the long (but entertaining) marching process. For instance, when baby penguins die and mothers are left alone, their cries of agony hit with an unexpected punch: seeing these penguins make such a difficult journey only to lose the entire purpose of leaving home becomes absolutely devastating. Fortunately, the film is full of humor and is aesthetically pleasing, with stellar camera work that portrays Antarctica as a series of monoliths reminiscent of human faces, a snowed-over version of what we imagine Mars to be. Ultimately, Jacquet achieves success in not allowing boredom to be among the myriad emotions one feels throughout the documentary; ""March of the Penguins"" is obviously one of the most complete films of the year, distinguished in how compelling a literal march of penguins becomes through the eyes of someone as curious about penguins as Jacquet.",5,a great achievement for its visual beauty and humanistic portrayel of penguins,1122681600,"07 30, 2005",2005,1575,"['are', 'favorite', 'animals', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'penguins', 'be', 'as', 'expressive', 'are', 'film', 'fact', 'emotions', 'are', 'made', 'so', 'palpable', 'feel', 'are', 'watching', 'people', 'interact', 'march', 'barren', 'continent', 'popular', 'documentary', 'greatest', 'achievement', 'making', 'one', 'realize', 'humanity', 'creatures', 'claim', 'have', 'feelings', 'Jacqet', 'contradicts', 'such', 'statements', 'masterfully', 'observed', 'sequences', 'such', 'male', 'female', 'penguin', 'exploring', 'other', 'bodies', 'lovingly', 'almost', 'youthful', 'teenagers', 'experiencing', 'sex', 'first', 'time', 'nostalgic', 'summer', 'romance', 'Additionally', 'Jacquet', 'skillfully', 'bond', 'audience', 'subject', 'long', 'entertaining', 'marching', 'process', 'instance', 'when', 'baby', 'die', 'mothers', 'are', 'left', 'alone', 'cries', 'agony', 'hit', 'unexpected', 'punch', 'seeing', 'penguins', 'make', 'difficult', 'journey', 'only', 'lose', 'entire', 'purpose', 'leaving', 'home', 'becomes', 'absolutely', 'devastating', 'Fortunately', 'film', 'full', 'humor', 'aesthetically', 'pleasing', 'stellar', 'camera', 'work', 'Antarctica', 'series', 'monoliths', 'reminiscent', 'human', 'snowed-over', 'version', 'what', 'imagine', 'Mars', 'be', 'Ultimately', 'Jacquet', 'success', 'not', 'allowing', 'boredom', 'be', 'myriad', 'emotions', 'one', 'feels', 'documentary', 'March', 'Penguins', 'obviously', 'one', 'most', 'complete', 'films', 'year', 'distinguished', 'how', 'compelling', 'literal', 'march', 'penguins', 'becomes', 'eyes', 'someone', 'curious', 'about', 'Jacquet']",N/A
640235,A1SPB225CVTRUU,B00005JOFZ,"Wing Lee ""filmfan""","[3, 3]","March of the Penguins could easily be this year's best and most memorable documentary feature, and it's become a huge hit surpassing other major Hollywood movies at the box office. Having seen Winged Migration twice at the cinemas two years ago, I must say that this film really lived upto it's hype, because it's such a wonderful family film that is educational, entertaining, and a heartfelt experience. The story is complete and since it's focused on the life of penguins, it's more captivating and suspenseful. Even though this film is not as visually stunning as Winged Migration, I found it to be more interesting, compelling, and touching.Penguins chose to stay in Antartica when all other species have migrated south for more bearable climates. They can endure and survive the coldest weather, and they have unity.Penguins feed during the summer days before marching 70 miles to their breeding ground during the winter. They mate and the females will eventually lay an egg. There are more females than males, so there is always competition between the ""ladies"". Once the egg is laid, the male penguin is responsible to look after the egg and keep it warm between his feet and belly, so it wouldn't freeze. Then the females must return to sea to find food since they have been starving for weeks, and they have lost about half of their weight. Meanwhile the males are struggling to survive the harsh weather and even if they are hungry, they still  have to endure at least several months without food until the females return. Some may not survive that long and die. The eggs are hatched before the mothers return, and sometimes the fathers will vomit some kind of fluid to feed the chicks so that they won't starve to death, but some will still die from the freezing temperature.Not all the mothers can return safe and sound, because they sometimes encounter predators in the ocean such as seals, and the chicks will not make it if they die. For the more fortunate penguins, they will have a happen family gathering when the chicks get to see their mothers for the first time and get fed. Then it's the father penguins turn to return to sea to feed themselves while the mothers take over the nurturing of the chicks, and soon they would grow strong enough to be on their own.The hardship that these penguins have to endure is incredible and us humans shouldn't be complaining about living conditions. The film is accompanied by a beautiful score that really makes the touching moments more moving and I was on the verge of tears during the dying moment of an older penguin and some of the unfortunate chicks. The penguins are so human like, because they are monogamous, loving, and devoted to making a family. I enjoyed the narration by Morgan Freeman who had a very sincere voice that was perfect for the story about love amongst the penguins.",5,Life Isn't Easy For the Penguins.,1125446400,"08 31, 2005",2005,2852,"['March', 'Penguins', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'year', 'best', 'most', 'memorable', 'documentary', 'feature', 'become', 'huge', 'hit', 'surpassing', 'other', 'major', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'box', 'office', 'Having', 'seen', 'Winged', 'Migration', 'twice', 'cinemas', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'must', 'say', 'film', 'really', 'lived', 'upto', 'hype', 'such', 'wonderful', 'family', 'film', 'educational', 'entertaining', 'heartfelt', 'experience', 'story', 'complete', 'focused', 'life', 'penguins', 'more', 'captivating', 'suspenseful', 'Even', 'film', 'not', 'visually', 'stunning', 'Winged', 'Migration', 'found', 'be', 'more', 'interesting', 'compelling', 'touching.Penguins', 'chose', 'stay', 'Antartica', 'when', 'other', 'species', 'have', 'migrated', 'south', 'more', 'bearable', 'climates', 'can', 'endure', 'survive', 'coldest', 'weather', 'have', 'unity.Penguins', 'feed', 'summer', 'days', 'marching', '70', 'miles', 'breeding', 'ground', 'winter', 'mate', 'females', 'will', 'eventually', 'lay', 'egg', 'are', 'more', 'females', 'males', 'always', 'competition', 'ladies', 'egg', 'laid', 'male', 'penguin', 'responsible', 'look', 'egg', 'keep', 'warm', 'feet', 'belly', 'would', ""n't"", 'freeze', 'Then', 'females', 'must', 'return', 'sea', 'find', 'food', 'have', 'been', 'starving', 'weeks', 'have', 'lost', 'half', 'weight', 'Meanwhile', 'males', 'are', 'struggling', 'survive', 'harsh', 'weather', 'even', 'are', 'hungry', 'still', 'have', 'endure', 'least', 'several', 'months', 'food', 'females', 'return', 'may', 'not', 'survive', 'long', 'die', 'eggs', 'are', 'hatched', 'mothers', 'return', 'sometimes', 'fathers', 'will', 'vomit', 'kind', 'fluid', 'feed', 'chicks', 'wo', ""n't"", 'starve', 'death', 'will', 'still', 'die', 'freezing', 'temperature.Not', 'mothers', 'can', 'return', 'safe', 'sound', 'sometimes', 'encounter', 'predators', 'ocean', 'such', 'seals', 'chicks', 'will', 'not', 'make', 'die', 'more', 'fortunate', 'penguins', 'will', 'have', 'happen', 'family', 'gathering', 'when', 'chicks', 'get', 'see', 'mothers', 'first', 'time', 'get', 'fed', 'Then', 'father', 'turn', 'return', 'sea', 'feed', 'mothers', 'take', 'nurturing', 'chicks', 'soon', 'would', 'grow', 'strong', 'enough', 'be', 'own.The', 'hardship', 'penguins', 'have', 'endure', 'incredible', 'humans', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'complaining', 'living', 'conditions', 'film', 'accompanied', 'beautiful', 'score', 'really', 'touching', 'moments', 'more', 'moving', 'was', 'verge', 'tears', 'dying', 'moment', 'older', 'penguin', 'unfortunate', 'chicks', 'penguins', 'are', 'so', 'human', 'are', 'monogamous', 'loving', 'devoted', 'making', 'family', 'enjoyed', 'narration', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'who', 'had', 'very', 'sincere', 'voice', 'was', 'perfect', 'story', 'love', 'amongst', 'penguins']",N/A

It involves cycles of forced marches of 70 miles, sometimes after months of starvation. It involves parent and child recognizing each other by voice alone, after months apart, among thousands of other. It involves monogamy and parental care, when fierce winds drop the temperatures to nearly 100 below under a sunless sky. It is a spectacular feat of endurance, instinct, and individual bonding.It's also a great reminder that the real world is a lot more amazing than fiction. It's exciting, inspiring, adventurous, and safe for kids. Skittish children might have trouble with a very few predatory scenes. More than just ""safe,"" I recommend it to parents who want to instil a sense of the world's wonder in their children. The pieces of this movie all come together in a wonderful blend of honesty, humor, love, and Morgan Freeman's narration.
