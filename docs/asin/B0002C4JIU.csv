The plot has a lot of twists and turns and a surprising ending.  This one is definitely easy to overlook but certainly worth seeing if you're a fan of thrillers.

I'm glad it is finally available on DVD.  It has re-watchability.  You think this is a love story.  Then you realize it is a drama.  Then it seems like a simple love story.  Then it is a drama.  Perfect editing!  It has the same type of tension that SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY had.  (That was the Julia Roberts movie where she changed her identity to escape her abusive husband).",4,Highly recommend,1093651200,"08 28, 2004",2004,491,"['week', 'used', 'check', 'TV', 'GUIDE', 'see', 'movie', 'was', 'playing', 'WGN', 'only', 'place', 'could', 'find', ""'m"", 'glad', 'finally', 'available', 'DVD', 're-watchability', 'think', 'love', 'story', 'Then', 'realize', 'drama', 'Then', 'simple', 'love', 'story', 'Then', 'drama', 'Perfect', 'editing', 'same', 'type', 'tension', 'SLEEPING', 'WITH', 'THE', 'ENEMY', 'had', 'was', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'movie', 'where', 'changed', 'identity', 'escape', 'abusive', 'husband']",N/A

Natasha Richardson, rest her soul gives one of her best preformances in this film. They both did stunning jobs of acting. Rutger plays a man that has went to jail for a murder he claims he never committed. Natasha plays his social worker after he is released. The movie is suspenseful and keeps you guessing from start to finish. Not only is the acting great but the storyline is wonderful. Natasha ends up trying to help Rutger clear himself of the crime but along the way she has hassitations of his innocence and runs into alot of problems along the way. If you have not seen this film it is a must see. I never took my eyes off of the television screen when I first saw it.VLH",5,Keeps You Watching From Start To Finish,1248912000,"07 30, 2009",2009,741,"['Past', 'midnight', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'Rutger', 'Hauer', 'Natasha', 'Richardson', 'rest', 'soul', 'one', 'best', 'preformances', 'film', 'did', 'stunning', 'jobs', 'acting', 'Rutger', 'man', 'went', 'jail', 'murder', 'never', 'committed', 'Natasha', 'social', 'worker', 'released', 'movie', 'suspenseful', 'guessing', 'start', 'finish', 'Not', 'only', 'acting', 'great', 'storyline', 'wonderful', 'Natasha', 'up', 'trying', 'help', 'Rutger', 'clear', 'crime', 'way', 'hassitations', 'innocence', 'alot', 'problems', 'way', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'film', 'must', 'see', 'never', 'took', 'eyes', 'television', 'screen', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'it.VLH']",N/A
