983314,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000F5JQVO,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","Poor Anthony Perkins.  He had such talent and yet that talent led him to be completely undervalued.  After nailing the repressive insanity of Norman Bates, he moved into a similarly disturbed Dennis Pitt and sealed the fate of his career.  Being typecast, he never progressed in his career, despite showing range in smaller films like `Goodbye Again'.  In `Pretty Poison', Perkins makes an even more distinctive switch between personas as the film progresses and his character becomes out-crazed.`Pretty Poison' is a delicious treat.I mainly expected this to be semi-campy fun, and after the first few scenes I thought that is what I was getting.  The morose music swelled in ways that painted an obvious picture, and the dialog falling from Perkin's lips was hilariously insane that I really was expecting this to be one of those cult favorites that holds up on camp value only.  But then, about mid-way through, things start to shift and you start to realize that what you saw as camp wasn't really camp at all.  As Dennis and Sue Ann develop their relationship, it becomes apparent who the crazy person really is and how far that person is willing to go to get what they think they deserve.Perkin's is pitch perfect, but it is Tuesday Weld who grabs the bulk of the acclaim for her terrifyingly realistic portrayal of Sue Ann.  The way she makes those tonal shifts with so much ease, it's flawless.  Beverly Garland is also wonderful as Sue Ann's mother, bottling her over the top paranoia in order to convey not only what Sue Ann describes but also what she really is.Oh, and Noel Black's direction is fantastic, not to mention the stunning cinematography that really helps set the mood.",4,Crazy good!,1342051200,"07 12, 2012",2012,1691,"['Poor', 'Anthony', 'Perkins', 'had', 'such', 'talent', 'yet', 'talent', 'led', 'be', 'completely', 'undervalued', 'nailing', 'repressive', 'insanity', 'Norman', 'Bates', 'moved', 'similarly', 'disturbed', 'Dennis', 'Pitt', 'sealed', 'fate', 'career', 'Being', 'typecast', 'never', 'progressed', 'career', 'showing', 'range', 'smaller', 'films', 'Goodbye', 'Again', 'Pretty', 'Poison', 'Perkins', 'even', 'more', 'distinctive', 'switch', 'personas', 'film', 'progresses', 'character', 'out-crazed.', 'Pretty', 'Poison', 'delicious', 'treat.I', 'mainly', 'expected', 'be', 'semi-campy', 'fun', 'first', 'few', 'scenes', 'thought', 'what', 'was', 'getting', 'morose', 'music', 'swelled', 'ways', 'painted', 'obvious', 'picture', 'dialog', 'falling', 'Perkin', 'lips', 'was', 'hilariously', 'insane', 'really', 'was', 'expecting', 'be', 'one', 'cult', 'up', 'camp', 'value', 'only', 'then', 'mid-way', 'things', 'start', 'shift', 'start', 'realize', 'what', 'saw', 'camp', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'camp', 'Dennis', 'Sue', 'Ann', 'develop', 'relationship', 'apparent', 'who', 'crazy', 'person', 'really', 'how', 'far', 'person', 'willing', 'go', 'get', 'what', 'think', 'deserve.Perkin', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'Tuesday', 'Weld', 'who', 'grabs', 'bulk', 'acclaim', 'terrifyingly', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'Sue', 'Ann', 'way', 'tonal', 'shifts', 'so', 'much', 'ease', 'flawless', 'Beverly', 'Garland', 'also', 'wonderful', 'Sue', 'Ann', 'mother', 'bottling', 'top', 'paranoia', 'order', 'convey', 'not', 'only', 'what', 'Sue', 'Ann', 'describes', 'also', 'what', 'really', 'is.Oh', 'Noel', 'Black', 'direction', 'fantastic', 'not', 'mention', 'stunning', 'cinematography', 'really', 'set', 'mood']","Pretty Poison ( She Let Him Continue ) [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - United Kingdom ]"

Just seeing her was worth the price of the rental.Usually I point out the photography or the riveting story as the facet (s) of the movie I enjoyed best, but in this case it's the actors and characters they played.It was also fun to see Tony Perkins (""Dennis Pitt"") play his Norman Bates-type ""Pyscho"" character again, although I prefer ""Bates"" over ""Pitt."" At least Bates wasn't all talk like Pitt was in this story. ""Norman"" delivered the goods, when needed! Here, Weld's ""Sue Ann Stepanek"" walks the talk.  Weld, by the way, proves in this film she's a lot more than a pretty face.For those watching for the first time, I would advise being patient with the first half of this film. The story doesn't really have much spark to it until ""Sue Ann"" begins to reveal her true inner self. which is not ""pretty."" Until then, we just get Perkins' nutcase character going on and on to Weld about his supposed CIA connections. Fortunately, as soon as this becomes tiresome, ""Sue Ann"" saves the film by springing into action.This a good movie that has been largely ignored over the years.

You just have to experience first hand the ingenious story twists and complex characterizations for yourself.

With the erosion of the Production Code this is quite daring stuff and pretty provocative for 1968.

The underappreciated Tuesday Weld gives an Oscar-worthy(not nominated, of course) turn as Sue Anne Stepanek, high school majorette and the object of Dennis' affections.  Good supporting turns by John Randolph as Dennis' caseworker and Beverly Garland as Sue Anne's strict mom.  The term indispensible is bandied about for a lot of films but not in this case.

As a heterosexual guy, I agree that you'd have to be deceased not to be turned on by her. Anthony Perkins is great as a mentally ill young man. The movie shows exactly what it would have been like to work inside a non union mill in New England in the 1960's (before they all moved overseas for more expolitable labor abd higher profits). The movie's  strengths are: first its length: 90 minutes- which in my view is exactly the right length for any movie-it is lean and sparse-like a lot of film noir classics of the late 1940's,in a good way in its editing-nothing is wasted in a way that puts today's movies to shame. The other strengths are the top notch acting of Weld and Perkins and the filming  on location in Great  Barrington Mass.  In addition ,Tuesday Weld acts in a way that is delightfully devious and sociopathic as to be the cinematic heir to  film noir's Lizabeth Scott of the 1940's. A weakness is that  there are about 3 or 4 parts in the movie where common sense would tell the viewer- that ""this doesnt make sense"" in the logical progression of the story- and other doable choices in the turn of the story were not taken-thus resulting in a 4 instead of doable 5 star rating.Lastly, no character in the movie is likable, in my opinion-in a way similar in this respect only to another classic film of the next year, (1969), ""The Prime of Ms. Jean Brodie"". Tuesday Weld-had a reputation in the 60's of thinking she was far more beautiful and talented than she in fact was-definitley beautiful and an excellent actress-but not quite as much  of both as she thought, in many observers opinions  and she turned down dozens of excellent roles- like ""Bonnie"" in Arthur Penn's 1967 ""Bonnie and Clyde"" to Faye  Dunaway . As a result ,""she did things HER way"", but was not quite the actress she could have been on screen .",4,Tuesday Weld is the heir to Lizabeth Scott!,1337990400,"05 26, 2012",2012,1956,"['movie', 'moderate', 'flaws', 'many', 'strengths', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'Tuesday', 'Weld', 'very', 'pretty', 'sexy', 'alluring', 'heterosexual', 'guy', 'agree', ""'d"", 'have', 'be', 'deceased', 'not', 'be', 'turned', 'Anthony', 'Perkins', 'great', 'mentally', 'ill', 'young', 'man', 'movie', 'exactly', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'work', 'inside', 'non', 'union', 'mill', 'New', 'England', '1960', 'moved', 'overseas', 'more', 'expolitable', 'labor', 'abd', 'higher', 'profits', 'movie', 'strengths', 'are', 'first', 'length', '90', 'minutes-', 'view', 'exactly', 'right', 'length', 'movie-it', 'lean', 'sparse-like', 'lot', 'film', 'noir', 'classics', 'late', '1940', 'good', 'way', 'editing-nothing', 'wasted', 'way', 'today', 'movies', 'shame', 'other', 'strengths', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'acting', 'Weld', 'Perkins', 'filming', 'location', 'Great', 'Barrington', 'Mass', 'addition', 'Tuesday', 'Weld', 'way', 'delightfully', 'devious', 'sociopathic', 'be', 'cinematic', 'heir', 'film', 'noir', 'Lizabeth', 'Scott', '1940', 'weakness', 'are', '3', '4', 'parts', 'movie', 'where', 'common', 'sense', 'would', 'tell', 'viewer-', 'doesnt', 'make', 'sense', 'logical', 'progression', 'story-', 'other', 'doable', 'choices', 'turn', 'story', 'were', 'not', 'taken-thus', 'resulting', '4', 'instead', 'doable', '5', 'star', 'rating.Lastly', 'character', 'movie', 'likable', 'opinion-in', 'way', 'similar', 'respect', 'only', 'classic', 'film', 'next', 'year', '1969', 'Prime', 'Ms.', 'Jean', 'Brodie', 'Tuesday', 'Weld-had', 'reputation', '60', 'thinking', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'beautiful', 'talented', 'fact', 'was-definitley', 'beautiful', 'excellent', 'actress-but', 'not', 'quite', 'much', 'thought', 'many', 'observers', 'opinions', 'turned', 'down', 'dozens', 'excellent', 'roles-', 'Bonnie', 'Arthur', 'Penn', '1967', 'Bonnie', 'Clyde', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'result', 'did', 'things', 'HER', 'way', 'was', 'not', 'quite', 'actress', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'screen']","Pretty Poison ( She Let Him Continue ) [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - United Kingdom ]"

It is Perkins' performance as Dennis Pitt that makes this movie work so well. At the onset of the story, we know Dennis is being placed on probation as he leaves his voluntary treatment. We do not know the reasons for these terms, yet we are given some foreshadowing hints. How dangerous was he, and is he still capable of perpetrating these acts? Fortunately, we find out the answer to this through his interaction with Sue Ann Stepanek, a pretty high school senior who is attracted to his ostensibly cosmopolitan, important stature. You see, Dennis likes to fantasize that he is involved with top secret missions with the CIA. We don't know whether he does this merely to impress people or he simply finds this a more entertaining way to live his life. Either way, we know it is not true, but does Sue Ann? This is a good ""little"" movie, which has a limited cast and a budget to match. It was directed by Noel Black, a veteran TV director, who also wrote the semi-autobiographical coming-of-age film ""Mischief."" In addition to the great performance by Anthony Perkins, there are some fine supporting performances by character actors John Randolph as Pitt's probation office and Dick O'Neill as the plant foreman. At about twenty-four years of age, Tuesday Weld looks slightly older than a high school student, but she turns in a decent performance nonetheless. The widescreen transfer is quite good and subtitles are a welcome option. With scarcely any bad language, no nudity and very mild violence, this film would warrant a PG rating if re-rated today.",4,Love finds Walter Mitty,1169510400,"01 23, 2007",2007,1715,"['3.5/5', 'stars', 'so', 'difficult', 'not', 'like', 'Anthony', 'Perkins', 'even', 'when', 'characters', 'do', 'things', 'should', 'frustrate', 'anger', 'such', 'killing', 'people', 'Perkins', 'performance', 'Dennis', 'Pitt', 'movie', 'work', 'so', 'well', 'onset', 'story', 'know', 'Dennis', 'being', 'placed', 'probation', 'voluntary', 'treatment', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'reasons', 'terms', 'yet', 'are', 'given', 'foreshadowing', 'hints', 'How', 'dangerous', 'was', 'still', 'capable', 'perpetrating', 'acts', 'Fortunately', 'find', 'out', 'answer', 'interaction', 'Sue', 'Ann', 'Stepanek', 'pretty', 'high', 'school', 'senior', 'who', 'attracted', 'ostensibly', 'cosmopolitan', 'important', 'stature', 'see', 'Dennis', 'fantasize', 'involved', 'top', 'secret', 'missions', 'CIA', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'merely', 'impress', 'people', 'simply', 'more', 'entertaining', 'way', 'live', 'life', 'way', 'know', 'not', 'true', 'Sue', 'Ann', 'good', 'little', 'movie', 'limited', 'cast', 'budget', 'match', 'was', 'directed', 'Noel', 'Black', 'veteran', 'TV', 'director', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'semi-autobiographical', 'coming-of-age', 'film', 'Mischief', 'addition', 'great', 'performance', 'Anthony', 'Perkins', 'are', 'fine', 'supporting', 'performances', 'character', 'actors', 'John', 'Randolph', 'Pitt', 'probation', 'office', 'Dick', ""O'Neill"", 'plant', 'foreman', 'twenty-four', 'years', 'age', 'Tuesday', 'Weld', 'slightly', 'older', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'decent', 'performance', 'nonetheless', 'widescreen', 'transfer', 'quite', 'good', 'subtitles', 'are', 'welcome', 'option', 'scarcely', 'bad', 'language', 'nudity', 'very', 'mild', 'violence', 'film', 'would', 'warrant', 'PG', 'rating', 're-rated', 'today']","Pretty Poison ( She Let Him Continue ) [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - United Kingdom ]"
