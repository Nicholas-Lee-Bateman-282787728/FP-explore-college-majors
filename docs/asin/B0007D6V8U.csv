I, myself, think I only made it the first 30 or so. However, you will find a solid workout here in both circuit and cardio. Tony Horton is a like-able guy, although he always cues his lefts and rights. The music also gets old pretty quick. I like the 100-ab routine because you go through them so quickly that it doesn't feel like you're doing 100 sit ups. I also really like the meter/timer on the side that shows how much you've done so far and how much further you have to go.

I find Power 90 to be a reasonably strenuous workout, comprising circuit/weight training followed by yoga/cardio. Each day can be done in an hour, and by the time you finish, you know you have worked out. People started noticing a difference in my physique within 30-40 days, and the improvements continued throughout the cycle.A few caveats - if you want to make continuous progress, buy a set of bands or dumbbells separate so you can progress your weights upward. The 90 days of essentially 4 workouts (30 days of the 1-2 series and 60 of the 3-4 series) make for a bit of boredom and repetition. You essentially switch back and forth each day between cardio and circuit - and man, after 60 days, you know every Tony Hortonism, joke, cadence and gaffe.A good program if you follow it, and can get past the repetitive nature of it.",4,Effective but Repetitive,1269734400,"03 28, 2010",2010,916,"['am', 'second', 'round', 'Power', '90', 'head', 'P90X', 'Masters', 'series', 'find', '90', 'be', 'reasonably', 'strenuous', 'workout', 'comprising', 'circuit/weight', 'training', 'followed', 'yoga/cardio', 'day', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'hour', 'time', 'finish', 'know', 'have', 'worked', 'out', 'People', 'started', 'noticing', 'difference', 'physique', '30-40', 'days', 'improvements', 'continued', 'cycle.A', 'few', 'caveats', 'want', 'make', 'continuous', 'progress', 'buy', 'set', 'bands', 'dumbbells', 'separate', 'can', 'progress', 'weights', 'upward', '90', 'days', 'essentially', '4', 'workouts', '30', 'days', '1-2', 'series', '60', '3-4', 'series', 'make', 'bit', 'boredom', 'repetition', 'essentially', 'switch', 'back', 'forth', 'day', 'cardio', 'circuit', 'man', '60', 'days', 'know', 'Tony', 'Hortonism', 'joke', 'cadence', 'gaffe.A', 'good', 'program', 'follow', 'can', 'get', 'repetitive', 'nature']",Power 90: Tony Horton (The 90 Day In-Home Boot Camp for Total Body Transformation)

Being I wanted DVDs, I bought this one hoping it wasn't TOO over the top being I'm 69.  YAYY!  I was able to, still, perform most of it.  It'll take a while to do all of it.  It was easier when I was in my 50s/early 60s, though.  I've never been really into working out or going to fitness centers because I don't care to sweat, but I've always been strong despite that.  That has helped me now.  This DVD is worth EVERY penny!

880317,A1P4F6HIXU6WYE,B0007D6V8U,"Lee Mellott ""Work at Home Author""","[147, 153]","Power 90 is a 90 day program for men and women designed to transform your booty from NOT to HOT! The system includes 2 DVD's, a transformation tracker (paper calender to record your progress), descriptive booklet and guide to healthy eating.To begin the program you record your weight and measurements. Then push play with Tony the instructor in your DVD player. You alternate between circuit days and cardio/abs days. The circuit days include exercises such as heavy pants, push ups, one arm triceps, bicep curls, back flys, lunges and more. The cardio/abs day includes kickboxing, leg raises, ab work and more. As you progress you move from the first DVD to the progressively  harder second DVD. One very nice feature is each session is only about 30-40 minutes long. As the Beachbody company says from ""power to shower in under an hour"". Another great feature is the use of a sidebar on your picture screen. As you complete each exercise the color changes so you can view your time and progress.Tony the instructor is a peppy guy with a sense of humor but not overdone. He is accompanied by a man and a woman in each set. Cueing is good with modifications suggested for those who need it. You may do the workout with free weights or purchase bands from the company. The bands are heavy duty and in my opinion make the workout much more difficult but may put strain on the back.A simple diet guide is included in the program. Called ""Michi's ladder"" it suggests good foods to select from and eat most of the time. This is a simple brochure and more information is needed. To transform your body exercise is very important but what you eat counts A LOT! Not enough attention is paid to this.Beachbody also recommends supplements which they sell of course. They claim that these will enhance your workout and help you achieve the body of your dreams at a much more rapid pace. However, when I checked into it, I found the studies they had done were limited and incomplete. Many of the ingredients are unproven. I would think twice about purchasing them. A ""commercial"" for the supplements is included on all Beachbody tapes.I checked out the website over a period of several months and found a number of people who were happily shrinking in size and weight or gaining muscle. Many posted their pictures. Conversely, I also saw many who posted pictures and slowly faded from sight dropping out of the program, leaving their ""befores"" but no ""afters"" for all to see in cyberspace!I really think the exercise program can be very effective, but it is repetitious. Day after day you will for 90 days be doing the same thing. But its a boot camp. For those who want to kick a** and don't mind repetition - this may be the ticket. Those who want to try it should also check out the free message boards at the companies beachbody.com web site.Others may want to go with something simpler. Whatever you do, if you opt to go for it..stick with it a while before you post those ""before"" pictures just in case you never make it to the ""after"" stage!",4,"No fuss, no frills but effective way to transform your bod!",1107820800,"02 8, 2005",2005,3037,"['Power', '90', '90', 'day', 'program', 'men', 'women', 'designed', 'transform', 'booty', 'NOT', 'HOT', 'system', '2', 'DVD', 'transformation', 'tracker', 'paper', 'calender', 'record', 'progress', 'descriptive', 'booklet', 'guide', 'healthy', 'eating.To', 'begin', 'program', 'record', 'weight', 'measurements', 'Then', 'push', 'play', 'Tony', 'instructor', 'DVD', 'player', 'alternate', 'circuit', 'days', 'cardio/abs', 'days', 'circuit', 'days', 'include', 'exercises', 'such', 'heavy', 'pants', 'push', 'ups', 'one', 'arm', 'triceps', 'bicep', 'curls', 'back', 'flys', 'lunges', 'more', 'cardio/abs', 'day', 'kickboxing', 'leg', 'raises', 'ab', 'work', 'more', 'progress', 'move', 'first', 'DVD', 'progressively', 'harder', 'second', 'DVD', 'One', 'very', 'nice', 'feature', 'session', 'only', '30-40', 'minutes', 'long', 'Beachbody', 'company', 'power', 'shower', 'hour', 'great', 'feature', 'use', 'sidebar', 'picture', 'screen', 'complete', 'exercise', 'color', 'changes', 'can', 'view', 'time', 'progress.Tony', 'instructor', 'peppy', 'guy', 'sense', 'humor', 'not', 'overdone', 'accompanied', 'man', 'woman', 'set', 'Cueing', 'good', 'modifications', 'suggested', 'who', 'need', 'may', 'do', 'workout', 'free', 'weights', 'purchase', 'bands', 'company', 'bands', 'are', 'heavy', 'duty', 'opinion', 'make', 'workout', 'much', 'more', 'difficult', 'may', 'put', 'strain', 'back.A', 'simple', 'diet', 'guide', 'included', 'program', 'Called', 'Michi', 'ladder', 'good', 'foods', 'select', 'eat', 'most', 'time', 'simple', 'brochure', 'more', 'information', 'needed', 'transform', 'body', 'exercise', 'very', 'important', 'what', 'eat', 'LOT', 'Not', 'enough', 'attention', 'paid', 'this.Beachbody', 'also', 'supplements', 'sell', 'course', 'claim', 'will', 'enhance', 'workout', 'help', 'achieve', 'body', 'dreams', 'much', 'more', 'rapid', 'pace', 'However', 'when', 'checked', 'found', 'studies', 'had', 'done', 'were', 'limited', 'incomplete', 'Many', 'ingredients', 'are', 'unproven', 'would', 'think', 'twice', 'purchasing', 'commercial', 'supplements', 'included', 'Beachbody', 'tapes.I', 'checked', 'out', 'website', 'period', 'several', 'months', 'found', 'number', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'happily', 'shrinking', 'size', 'weight', 'gaining', 'muscle', 'Many', 'posted', 'pictures', 'Conversely', 'also', 'saw', 'many', 'who', 'posted', 'pictures', 'slowly', 'faded', 'sight', 'dropping', 'program', 'leaving', 'befores', 'afters', 'see', 'cyberspace', 'really', 'think', 'exercise', 'program', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'effective', 'repetitious', 'Day', 'day', 'will', '90', 'days', 'be', 'doing', 'same', 'thing', 'boot', 'camp', 'who', 'want', 'kick', 'a**', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'repetition', 'may', 'be', 'ticket', 'who', 'want', 'try', 'should', 'also', 'check', 'out', 'free', 'message', 'boards', 'companies', 'beachbody.com', 'web', 'site.Others', 'may', 'want', 'go', 'something', 'simpler', 'do', 'opt', 'go', 'it..stick', 'while', 'post', 'pictures', 'just', 'case', 'never', 'make', 'stage']",Power 90: Tony Horton (The 90 Day In-Home Boot Camp for Total Body Transformation)
