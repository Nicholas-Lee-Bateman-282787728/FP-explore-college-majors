I agree that it should be released on DVD; the prices for VHS are too high for a medium that tears up easily.  The storyline, about a singing star who escapes back to the area she came from to get away from showbiz, is cute but it's Dolly who makes the part.  The kids are adorable and I personally think that John Ritter has the best small part he ever played.  He just shines (and amuses you) as a judge.  I'd watch the show for that alone.

There she discovers several orphaned children who have run away from an abusive shelter.The movie is filled with holiday cheer, great new Dolly-composed songs, a witch, and several former 1970's TV stars in its cast like John Ritter and Lee Majors. The story was co-written by Dolly and is directed by the ""Fonz"" himself, Henry Winkler.The soundtrack has never been recorded for commercial use, but is filled with highlights including the title song and ""Mountain Magic"".Dolly would film another TV movie ten years later entitled ""Unlikely Angel"" that, unlike ""A Smoky Mountain Christmas"", is available on DVD. ""A Smoky Mountain Christmas"" was released commercially in the late eighties on VHS and on DVD in the early 2000's in Asia, but has never seen a rerelease on either DVD or Blue Ray in North America.
