I will agree that the first half of this film is really good and well executed. I will also agree that the last half is a little less interesting, though it is still certainly entertaining. I think Snipes made a wise decision by being apart of this film.This film produced by Andrew Stevens, who starred in one of my all time favorite films [The Terror Within], and has also produced other Wesley Snipes, Steven Seagal, and Kevin Sorbo films is about a heist gone completely wrong. And in the process turns into a rescue mission to save a girl, you know typical action hero stuff. Of course Snipes isn't really a good guy in this as he is one of the men who pulled the original heist. Like most people have stated the first half of this film is great, the heist and counter heist were put together excellently. The film really has you interested and ready to see what happens next, but that is were it falls a little short. Don't get me wrong the movie is still good enough to watch even own, but get it used or something.Director Simon Fellows and writer Martin Wheeler did a really good job with this low budget flick, you can tell both set forth to create an entertaining film for movie goers to see. Also performances were top notch, which for a low budget action flick is rare these days. Wesley Snipes obviously did is thing in this film, as did all of the other actors in this film.

Regardless, snipes is a great action actor, so I decided to check it out. The first 20 minutes or so were actually very good! It begins with an elaborately planned armored car company robbery ending in a pretty cool car chase and a terrible double-cross. But then, it spirals downhill quickly. The middle of this movie was soooo boring I almost gave up.The movie begins with snipes as an ex-special forces kind of guy now on the wrong side of the law. He plans this elaborate armored car company robbery, that goes terribly wrong. The woman he's ""with"" in the beginning gets kidnapped and he obviously has to rescue her. After the robbery goes wrong, he car jacks a lady who just happens to be a military official who must not be very busy because after she then makes it her personal mission to catch snipes. However, she SLOWLY, VERY SLOWLY, like so slow you could fall asleep, starts to realize that there are much badder people involved in the whole mess and then in the end teams up with snipes to get the real baddies. After the VERY SLOW middle part, the movie ends in another car chase.This movie is almost totally predictable, it's not a very good story, and the acting is pretty poor. I think snipes did a good job with what was handed to him, and some of the action sequences were good. But for the most part, this was just another straight to dvd movie that we have grown to expect from people like van damn and seagal. Definitely a step back for snipes.Rent it if you like, but buying it would be silly. You'll never watch it twice, and you probably won't even get through it once. Only die-hard snipes fans will be interested in this one.

Jack's failed robbery in Bucharest, Rumania, lands him in a fresh trouble because his girlfriend/partner-in-crime is kidnapped during the shoot-outs. He takes hostage a NATO military cop (Tamzin Outhwaite sporting her British accent) after the mayhem (and saving her life too), and engages in urban car chase with familiar settings. The story doesn't make much sense (why steal the money of casinos in Rumania?), but the earlier part of ""7 Seconds"" is fun with decent car stunts and a little bit of humor. The actions are confusing, and you don't know where these wildly running cars are going, but at least the stunts themselves are not bad.Then in the film's middle section tedium settles in, which stops the actions and starts to introduce superfluous characters, plus an unnecessary plot twist or two. We don't need to see Wesley Snipes walking in the station and putting a brief case in the coin locker there. Or actually we don't care what the briefcase really contains at all; and we don't even want to know whether something in it (whatever it is) is real or not. We want thrill and action, or funny dialogues. Except for some brief martial arts stunts and mildly amusing banter between Snipes and Outhwaite, ""7 Seconds"" doesn't have much to show, particularly in its second part, where the film has another car stunt sequence involving street cars, but it is marred by choppy editing.We often hear complaint or criticism about direct-to-video films, but actually some of them are pretty good, offering diverting 90 minutes like the films of Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren. Unfortunately, for all the fairly good acting from the stars, Wesley Snipes' ""7 Seconds"" is not one of them.",2,"""7 Seconds"" Starts Promisingly, Then Runs out of Gas Soon",1175385600,"04 1, 2007",2007,2251,"['latest', 'heist', 'professional', 'thief', 'team', 'terribly', 'awry', 'organizer', 'flawless', 'more', 'what', 'bargained', 'Agents', 'mobsters', 'chase', 'cool', 'pressure', 'other', 'party', 'plans', 'can', 'always', 'extricate', 'mire', 'standard', 'story', 'format', 'action', 'film', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'predictable', 'well', 'good', 'rhythm', 'action', 'sure-handed', 'guidance', 'director', '7', 'Seconds', ""n't"", 'have', 'them.Wesley', 'Snipes', 'thief', 'named', 'Jack', 'Jack', 'failed', 'robbery', 'Bucharest', 'Rumania', 'fresh', 'trouble', 'girlfriend/partner-in-crime', 'kidnapped', 'shoot-outs', 'hostage', 'NATO', 'military', 'cop', 'Tamzin', 'Outhwaite', 'sporting', 'British', 'accent', 'mayhem', 'saving', 'life', 'too', 'urban', 'car', 'chase', 'familiar', 'settings', 'story', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'why', 'steal', 'money', 'casinos', 'Rumania', 'earlier', 'part', '7', 'Seconds', 'fun', 'decent', 'car', 'stunts', 'little', 'bit', 'humor', 'actions', 'are', 'confusing', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'wildly', 'running', 'cars', 'are', 'going', 'least', 'stunts', 'are', 'not', 'bad.Then', 'film', 'middle', 'section', 'tedium', 'settles', 'actions', 'introduce', 'superfluous', 'characters', 'unnecessary', 'plot', 'twist', 'two', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'see', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'walking', 'station', 'putting', 'brief', 'case', 'coin', 'locker', 'there', 'actually', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'briefcase', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'want', 'know', 'something', 'real', 'not', 'want', 'thrill', 'action', 'funny', 'dialogues', 'brief', 'martial', 'arts', 'stunts', 'mildly', 'amusing', 'banter', 'Snipes', 'Outhwaite', '7', 'Seconds', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'show', 'particularly', 'second', 'part', 'where', 'film', 'car', 'stunt', 'sequence', 'involving', 'street', 'cars', 'marred', 'choppy', 'editing.We', 'often', 'hear', 'complaint', 'criticism', 'direct-to-video', 'films', 'actually', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'offering', 'diverting', '90', 'minutes', 'films', 'Jean-Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'Unfortunately', 'fairly', 'good', 'acting', 'stars', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', '7', 'Seconds', 'not', 'one']",7 Seconds
904789,A3KXV8AFQ550DY,B0009FU0ZG,Wayne C. Rogers,"[0, 0]","I've been a big fan of Wesley Snipes for the last fifteen years, since his film, Passenger 57.  When I saw Wesley in that movie, using his martial arts skills for the first time, I thought to myself that this guy fights just like the late Bruce Lee.  After that I followed every action movie that he did just so I could watch him do his martial arts.  Of course, his ""Blade"" trilogy series is perhaps the most memorable of all the films that he's done.  The role of Blade fits Wesley like a tight glove, plus it gives him the opportunity to really go all out with his martial arts.  Since 2004 and Blade: Trinity, Wesley has opted to do films based in Europe.  Why?  I don't know.  Maybe it has something to do with the money that the IRS claims he owes in back taxes.  Whatever the reason for this decision, it certainly has affected the quality of his films.  In fact, they've pretty much gone down hill in a similar vein as those done by Steven Seagal.  The only redeeming quality of Wesley's European movies is that he still does his own martial arts and can still kick ass in a big way.In 7 Seconds, Wesley Snipes plays Jack Tolliver, who used to be with Delta Force.  Due to a physical confrontation with his commander after a number of his men are killed, Tolliver ends up spending four years in prison.  When he gets out, Tolliver decides to use his unique skills in the Romanian criminal underworld and plans a special heist down to the last second that will net he and his gang twenty million dollars.  Everything goes perfectly, until the very end when his operation is betrayed from the inside so that the Russian gangsters can get their hands on an authentic Van Gogh painting, worth over sixty-five million dollars.  Almost all of Tolliver's crew is murdered.  Though his girlfriend is taken hostage, he manages to escape with a metal case that has the painting in it.  Tolliver, however, doesn't know what's in the mysterious case.  He inadvertently runs into Sergeant Kelly Anders (played by Tamzin Outhwaite), who's with the Military Police at the nearby NATO Air Force Base, while he's being chased by the police and the Russian mafia.  He keeps her from being shot and then uses her car to elude the people that are after him.  As the movie progresses, Tolliver will find himself alone and forced to turn to Anders for help, who now has her own problems to deal with.  Together, they will take on the Russian mafia and try to rescue Tolliver's girlfriend.I honestly didn't think that the movie made a lot of sense.  I got confused at the beginning of the film when the heist of the casino money and the three armored trucks supposedly takes place.  I wasn't following what was happening, and it looked like someone had screwed up with the planning and the intelligence on how the doors to the trucks were to be opened.  Then, after Kelly Anders is basically kidnapped and her car wrecked, the Romanian police accuse her of being Tolliver's accomplice.  Even her own people seem to have their doubts as to her innocence.  That just didn't ring true to me.  We also have the owner of the Van Gogh painting and the head of the Russian mafia (he has Parkinson's Disease and shakes all of the time) who seem to want the painting back for insurance purposes.  When the Russians have Tolliver at their mercy and torture him and his girlfriend to find out where the painting is at, they forget to check his pockets for the key to the locker at the Bus Terminal, or is it the Plane Terminal, and then they allow him to take them to the locker.  How stupid can you be?  Cut off some fingers and some toes.  He'll talk.  Whatever you do, don't let him loose, or else he'll come back and kill you.  The two car chases in the movie were so-so.  It's difficult to make the cars appear as if they're going fast when they're small and running on four cylinders.  The highlight of the movie is getting to watch Wesley Snipes do his martial arts.  He's probably the best film fighter in the movies today.  I'm always impressed with his hands and kicks, and the way he uses his knees and elbows to block and attack.  That's really the only reason to watch an action thriller with Snipes in it, unless it's one of the ""Blade"" movies.  Though 7 Seconds isn't the worse movie I've seen during the past year, it still could've been a lot better.  The script could've been better, the acting, the stunts, the photography, and the directing.  This is why the movie went straight to video here in the States.  Come on, Wesley, we need another ""Blade"" movie before you get too old to do them!",3,Wesley still has a kick or two left in him!!!,1167868800,"01 4, 2007",2007,4584,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'last', 'fifteen', 'years', 'film', 'Passenger', '57', 'When', 'saw', 'Wesley', 'movie', 'using', 'martial', 'arts', 'skills', 'first', 'time', 'thought', 'myself', 'guy', 'fights', 'just', 'late', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'followed', 'action', 'movie', 'did', 'just', 'so', 'could', 'watch', 'do', 'martial', 'arts', 'course', 'Blade', 'trilogy', 'series', 'perhaps', 'most', 'memorable', 'films', 'done', 'role', 'Blade', 'fits', 'Wesley', 'tight', 'glove', 'opportunity', 'really', 'go', 'out', 'martial', 'arts', '2004', 'Blade', 'Trinity', 'Wesley', 'opted', 'do', 'films', 'based', 'Europe', 'Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Maybe', 'something', 'do', 'money', 'IRS', 'back', 'taxes', 'reason', 'decision', 'certainly', 'affected', 'quality', 'films', 'fact', ""'ve"", 'pretty', 'much', 'gone', 'down', 'hill', 'similar', 'vein', 'done', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'only', 'redeeming', 'quality', 'Wesley', 'European', 'movies', 'still', 'own', 'martial', 'arts', 'can', 'still', 'kick', 'ass', 'big', 'way.In', '7', 'Seconds', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'Jack', 'Tolliver', 'who', 'used', 'be', 'Delta', 'Force', 'Due', 'physical', 'confrontation', 'commander', 'number', 'men', 'are', 'killed', 'Tolliver', 'up', 'spending', 'four', 'years', 'prison', 'When', 'out', 'Tolliver', 'use', 'unique', 'skills', 'Romanian', 'criminal', 'underworld', 'special', 'heist', 'last', 'second', 'will', 'net', 'gang', 'twenty', 'million', 'dollars', 'Everything', 'perfectly', 'very', 'end', 'when', 'operation', 'betrayed', 'inside', 'Russian', 'gangsters', 'can', 'get', 'hands', 'authentic', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'painting', 'worth', 'sixty-five', 'million', 'dollars', 'Almost', 'Tolliver', 'crew', 'murdered', 'girlfriend', 'taken', 'hostage', 'escape', 'metal', 'case', 'painting', 'Tolliver', 'however', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'mysterious', 'case', 'inadvertently', 'Sergeant', 'Kelly', 'Anders', 'played', 'Tamzin', 'Outhwaite', 'who', 'Military', 'Police', 'nearby', 'NATO', 'Air', 'Force', 'Base', 'being', 'chased', 'police', 'Russian', 'mafia', 'being', 'shot', 'then', 'car', 'elude', 'people', 'are', 'movie', 'Tolliver', 'will', 'find', 'alone', 'forced', 'turn', 'Anders', 'help', 'who', 'now', 'own', 'problems', 'deal', 'Together', 'will', 'take', 'Russian', 'mafia', 'try', 'rescue', 'Tolliver', 'girlfriend.I', 'honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'made', 'lot', 'sense', 'got', 'confused', 'beginning', 'film', 'when', 'heist', 'casino', 'money', 'three', 'armored', 'trucks', 'supposedly', 'place', 'was', ""n't"", 'following', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'looked', 'someone', 'had', 'screwed', 'up', 'planning', 'intelligence', 'how', 'doors', 'trucks', 'were', 'be', 'opened', 'Then', 'Kelly', 'Anders', 'basically', 'kidnapped', 'car', 'wrecked', 'Romanian', 'police', 'being', 'Tolliver', 'accomplice', 'Even', 'own', 'people', 'seem', 'have', 'doubts', 'innocence', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'ring', 'true', 'also', 'have', 'owner', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'painting', 'head', 'Russian', 'mafia', 'Parkinson', 'Disease', 'time', 'who', 'seem', 'want', 'painting', 'back', 'insurance', 'purposes', 'When', 'Russians', 'have', 'Tolliver', 'mercy', 'torture', 'girlfriend', 'find', 'out', 'where', 'painting', 'forget', 'check', 'pockets', 'key', 'locker', 'Bus', 'Terminal', 'Plane', 'Terminal', 'then', 'allow', 'take', 'locker', 'How', 'stupid', 'can', 'be', 'Cut', 'off', 'fingers', 'toes', ""'ll"", 'talk', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'loose', 'else', ""'ll"", 'come', 'back', 'kill', 'two', 'car', 'chases', 'movie', 'were', 'so-so', 'difficult', 'make', 'cars', 'appear', ""'re"", 'going', 'fast', 'when', ""'re"", 'small', 'running', 'four', 'cylinders', 'highlight', 'movie', 'getting', 'watch', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'do', 'martial', 'arts', 'probably', 'best', 'film', 'fighter', 'movies', 'today', ""'m"", 'always', 'impressed', 'hands', 'kicks', 'way', 'knees', 'elbows', 'block', 'attack', 'really', 'only', 'reason', 'watch', 'action', 'thriller', 'Snipes', 'one', 'Blade', 'movies', '7', 'Seconds', ""n't"", 'worse', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'past', 'year', 'still', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'lot', 'better', 'script', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'acting', 'stunts', 'photography', 'directing', 'why', 'movie', 'went', 'straight', 'video', 'here', 'States', 'Come', 'Wesley', 'need', 'Blade', 'movie', 'get', 'too', 'old', 'do']",7 Seconds
