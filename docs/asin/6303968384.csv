I respect it and in many ways I try to practice it. I watched this film twice giving it my full attention.  I truly enjoyed the scenery and the overall artistic style was very nice.  I did watch it on a VHS tape so it was a bit grainy but that may have added to the charm.  The problem I have with this film is that it goes against my understanding/concept of Buddhism and Zen teachings.  The entire film was a depressing ordeal from beginning to end. I understand the intent and lessons of the film but I would rather see a Zen Master who treated his family with kindness and affection.  A boy lost in the woods and no one cares.  A group of people sitting around the fire in silence who do not recognize the existance of another human being. This is not a Master who I would respect or even enjoy being in his company.  A dying Master who smiled on his death bed and showed compassion is what I want to see.  Life and Death is a combination of emotions.  There should be SOME joy in both Living and Dying. Perhaps this Master needed more training... Then again maybe it will be better for him the next time around. If the intent of this movie is to show how unhappy people can be then it is a Winner.

393650,ACVNA57PI4DLV,6303968384,Francois Tremblay,"[8, 34]","""Why has Bodhi-Dharma Left for the East?"" is a movie that takes place in a Buddhist hermitage deep in the mountains. The story is pretty simple : the Master is on the brink of death and tries to impart to one of his monks enlightenment about the cycle of life and death.It's a contemplative movie, much like the Iranian stuff Kiarostami has made popular. So what we need to look at first are the images and the atmosphere. Well, it's very dissapointing. There are sparks of beauty and raw emotion here and there, but most of the images are murky, badly framed, and sometimes a stereotypical ""city is bad, rural is good"" pap. The DVD itself is TV-quality, and this detracts greatly from the shots. I don't care where (South Korea) or how (with one handheld camera) it was filmed, if it looks crappy, it can't be a good contemplative movie, period.Not only is the theme of this story based on the bad side of Buddhist teachings - the idea that we must cut ourselves from the world and progress - but the images are not nearly good enough to sustain the movie.

393652,A1OZFMJ2AD2R41,6303968384,Furiae,"[49, 64]","As a Buddhist from a devout Buddhist family, I was delighted to find a film about the Mahayana.  I bought it and brought it to California with me on a recent trip when I visited my family, and even invited our teacher, a Vajrayana lama to watch with us.I going to try to word my words respectfully.  Though I appreciate what the author has done and I fully applaud all efforts in Buddhist filmmaking, I was left disappointed with 'Why Has Bodhi-Dharma Left for the East.'The movie is indeed shot beautifully, with gorgeous images and very poetic scenes.  However, imagery does not a movie make.I can see the director's intentions, but some parts terribly misrepresent the path of cultivation.  For instance, the old monk's body is in its current damaged state because he meditated up against a block of ice in attempt to conquer sleep.  Not only is this not advisable and detrimental to health, but misrepresentative of the practice.  Buddha starved with the ascetics only to come to the conclusion that to put his body through so much suffering is extremist, and instead, we should opt for moderation and the middle way.  And why should we want to conquer sleep, anyway?  What's the point?  When Buddha walked the earth with us, even he had to bow to the physical limits of his nirmanakaya form and ate, slept, and cared for his body.The Dharma should bring its followers peace of mind, fulfillment, contentment, and more and more happiness as we practice it more and more.  However, this movie portrays monks undergoing mental torment and anguish throughout the movie.  It seemed as if the movie piled more and more anguish on the monks as the movie progressed.  The only scene I saw where they were at ease and happy was when the old monk pulled a tooth from the boy monk with the help of his other disciple.  In my opinion, it should have been the other way around, with them growing freer and freer, happier and happier, more and more peaceful as the movie went on.Zen is not abstract, it is actually a very straightforward practice, but I fear non-Buddhists who watch this and base all their opinions off it will take away the wrong message of not only Zen, but Buddhism in general.  The concept of Bodhicitta (vast, impartial love for all beings) that is the very heart of all Mahayana practice isn't even addressed (a slight reference is made to compassion).I would consider a successful Buddhist film to be one that inspires its viewers to arouse bodhicitta themselves and, like the Buddha, go forth into the world bravely to alleviate the suffering of the world.  That was not the goal, however, with this film.  It instead focuses on Zen, but without portraying and emphasizing the bodhicitta (or growing, budding bodhicitta) of the monks and how they progress towards that goal using Zen as a means of practice, the concept of &quot;Zen&quot; itself becomes pretentious, useless, and hollow.  With this movie, it's as if the very heart of the practice- love, compassion, tolerance for all beings- was left out.  Zen is just a way of practice.  If Zen is the ship and wisdom the anchor, compassion is the wind that powers the sails.  To make a movie just about &quot;Zen&quot; without giving equal (if not more) emphasis to the other two- wisdom and compassion- is to have a boat lost and just sitting out at sea.  That's how I felt about the movie, that it had no sense of direction or point at the end.That's how I feel about the movie, that it lacks heart.  If you're looking for a Buddhist movie with plenty of heart, I would suggest the movie &quot;The Cup&quot; over this one (it was nominated for 'Best Foreign Film' from Bhutan, but lost the Oscar to 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon').  It's absolutely delightful and wonderfully represents active compassion in practice.I'm sorry if I offend anybody who enjoyed this film-- it's just one person's opinion =)",2,"applaud the effort, but it left me wanting",1077753600,"02 26, 2004",2004,3877,"['Buddhist', 'devout', 'Buddhist', 'family', 'was', 'delighted', 'find', 'film', 'Mahayana', 'bought', 'brought', 'California', 'recent', 'trip', 'when', 'visited', 'family', 'even', 'invited', 'teacher', 'Vajrayana', 'lama', 'watch', 'us.I', 'going', 'try', 'word', 'words', 'respectfully', 'appreciate', 'what', 'author', 'done', 'fully', 'applaud', 'efforts', 'Buddhist', 'filmmaking', 'was', 'left', 'disappointed', 'Has', 'Bodhi-Dharma', 'Left', 'East', 'movie', 'indeed', 'shot', 'beautifully', 'gorgeous', 'images', 'very', 'poetic', 'scenes', 'However', 'imagery', 'not', 'movie', 'make.I', 'can', 'see', 'director', 'intentions', 'parts', 'terribly', 'misrepresent', 'path', 'cultivation', 'instance', 'old', 'monk', 'body', 'current', 'damaged', 'state', 'meditated', 'up', 'block', 'ice', 'attempt', 'conquer', 'sleep', 'Not', 'only', 'not', 'advisable', 'detrimental', 'health', 'misrepresentative', 'practice', 'Buddha', 'starved', 'ascetics', 'only', 'come', 'conclusion', 'put', 'body', 'so', 'much', 'suffering', 'extremist', 'instead', 'should', 'opt', 'moderation', 'middle', 'way', 'why', 'should', 'want', 'conquer', 'sleep', 'anyway', 'What', 'point', 'When', 'Buddha', 'walked', 'earth', 'even', 'had', 'bow', 'physical', 'limits', 'nirmanakaya', 'form', 'ate', 'slept', 'cared', 'body.The', 'Dharma', 'should', 'bring', 'followers', 'peace', 'mind', 'fulfillment', 'contentment', 'more', 'more', 'happiness', 'practice', 'more', 'more', 'However', 'movie', 'monks', 'undergoing', 'mental', 'torment', 'anguish', 'movie', 'seemed', 'movie', 'piled', 'more', 'more', 'anguish', 'monks', 'movie', 'progressed', 'only', 'scene', 'saw', 'where', 'were', 'ease', 'happy', 'was', 'when', 'old', 'monk', 'pulled', 'tooth', 'boy', 'monk', 'help', 'other', 'disciple', 'opinion', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'other', 'way', 'growing', 'freer', 'freer', 'happier', 'happier', 'more', 'more', 'peaceful', 'movie', 'went', 'on.Zen', 'not', 'abstract', 'actually', 'very', 'straightforward', 'practice', 'fear', 'non-Buddhists', 'who', 'watch', 'base', 'opinions', 'will', 'take', 'away', 'wrong', 'message', 'not', 'only', 'Zen', 'Buddhism', 'general', 'concept', 'Bodhicitta', 'vast', 'impartial', 'love', 'beings', 'very', 'heart', 'Mahayana', 'practice', ""n't"", 'even', 'addressed', 'slight', 'reference', 'made', 'compassion', '.I', 'would', 'consider', 'successful', 'Buddhist', 'film', 'be', 'one', 'viewers', 'arouse', 'bodhicitta', 'Buddha', 'go', 'forth', 'world', 'bravely', 'alleviate', 'suffering', 'world', 'was', 'not', 'goal', 'however', 'film', 'instead', 'Zen', 'portraying', 'emphasizing', 'bodhicitta', 'growing', 'budding', 'bodhicitta', 'monks', 'how', 'progress', 'towards', 'goal', 'using', 'Zen', 'means', 'practice', 'concept', 'quot', 'Zen', 'quot', 'pretentious', 'useless', 'hollow', 'movie', 'very', 'heart', 'practice-', 'love', 'compassion', 'tolerance', 'beings-', 'was', 'left', 'out', 'Zen', 'just', 'way', 'practice', 'Zen', 'ship', 'wisdom', 'anchor', 'compassion', 'wind', 'sails', 'make', 'movie', 'just', 'quot', 'Zen', 'quot', 'giving', 'equal', 'not', 'more', 'emphasis', 'other', 'two-', 'wisdom', 'compassion-', 'have', 'boat', 'lost', 'just', 'sitting', 'out', 'sea', 'how', 'felt', 'movie', 'had', 'sense', 'direction', 'point', 'end.That', 'how', 'feel', 'movie', 'heart', ""'re"", 'looking', 'Buddhist', 'movie', 'plenty', 'heart', 'would', 'suggest', 'movie', 'quot', 'Cup', 'quot', 'one', 'was', 'nominated', ""'Best"", 'Foreign', 'Film', 'Bhutan', 'lost', 'Oscar', ""'Crouching"", 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', 'absolutely', 'delightful', 'wonderfully', 'active', 'compassion', 'practice.I', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'offend', 'anybody', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'just', 'one', 'person', 'opinion', '=']",Why Has Bodhi-Dharma Left for the East VHS

393655,A2HKXCAJT5Z7DP,6303968384,John S. Hilliard,"[3, 4]","Buddhism, particularly Zen Buddhism is a central part of my life.  Of course that does not make me a faultless judge of something which purports to be proselytizing one of the most compassionate religions of the world.  And I am sure many of the Buddhist followers/scholars will disagree with my opinion of this movie. Ultimately in things like art and religion, we each must form our own values and opinions, of course.But in short, from my understanding of Zen Buddhist criteria, ""Why Has Bodhi-Dharma Left for the East"" is a very weak and incomplete visual sutra. One of the primary tenets of Buddhism, in all the vehicles, is compassion. And instead of illuminating compassion, this film focuses on alienation, abstruse narrative, emotional coldness and sometimes even cruelty.  Perhaps its purpose is to show that life is hard.  But if that is the case, where is the saving grace of true Buddhism demonstrated here?  The only dharmic moments come from the landscape.  If the film had had no humans in it, I believe it would have taught us more about love and beauty.  Even the statements of the aged monks in the film seem distanced, empty, confusing, and lacking warmth.  So, regretfully, I can't recommend it as a Buddhist film.Not only this, but ignoring Buddhist matters, the film is in great need of some artistic and intelligent editing.  The Tricycle magazine review on the cover praises the movie as in the tradition of the Japanese filmmaker Ozu.  That is extremely far from the truth, if Ozu had done this film it would have lasted ca. 90 minutes, if that, not 145 minutes.  He believed in not prolonging a narrative sequence, but keeping it cryptically brief (he also believed in subtracting movie plot-line).

393658,A22HH1ZD85HN6H,6303968384,P. Belfiglio,"[5, 5]","A while back I wrote a review about this movie as it pertained to the older, previously released DVD.  When this newer version came out, I was hesitant to purchase it because, of course, I already owned a copy.  However I am glad I did.  The enhanced audio and visual quality of this release made the purchase worthwhile.  I even enjoy the added scenes that are not in the earlier version.  For what it's worth here is my previous review:""I was thinking (first mistake!) of saying, ""Top Five."" Then I realized that this is more than even ""Top Three (or Two)"" of all the movies I have in my collection, or have ever viewed, for that matter. The real perplexity is that I don't know why, exactly, except for the fact that it is the only movie that I think about and view more than any other DVD that I have. And so that is why it stands foremost (Doctor Zhivago has now been relegated to the silver podium, at least for these reasons) above of all the other DVD's in my assorted collection. True, as some have commented here, it is not astutely a portrayal of Zen Buddhism as it might be explicated in the truest sense of its dogmas. How would you depict and encapsulate the essence of Zen through the modality of a visual, i.e., movie experience anyway? Pretty tall order, even for The Buddha, I would imagine. This movie for me, however, is a catalyst for SOME things that are related to Zen Buddhism. But overall it leaves that stage and affords me with a visual, meditative experience, be it akin to Zen Buddhism or something other (even Christianity -- for me). Needless to say, this is not a film for everyone; it is not of the ""Saturday Night at the Movies"" genre; it just touches me in a deep, esoteric psychological and spiritual way. Perhaps this movie is something as to what Paul Valery stated: ""To see is to forget the name of the thing one sees.""",5,The Best is Now Better,1240963200,"04 29, 2009",2009,1858,"['while', 'back', 'wrote', 'review', 'movie', 'pertained', 'older', 'previously', 'released', 'DVD', 'When', 'newer', 'version', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'hesitant', 'purchase', 'course', 'already', 'owned', 'copy', 'However', 'am', 'glad', 'did', 'enhanced', 'audio', 'visual', 'quality', 'release', 'made', 'purchase', 'worthwhile', 'even', 'enjoy', 'added', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'earlier', 'version', 'what', 'worth', 'here', 'previous', 'review', 'was', 'thinking', 'first', 'mistake', 'saying', 'Top', 'Five', 'Then', 'realized', 'more', 'even', 'Top', 'Three', 'Two', 'movies', 'have', 'collection', 'have', 'ever', 'viewed', 'matter', 'real', 'perplexity', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'exactly', 'fact', 'only', 'movie', 'think', 'view', 'more', 'other', 'DVD', 'have', 'so', 'why', 'foremost', 'Doctor', 'Zhivago', 'now', 'been', 'relegated', 'silver', 'podium', 'least', 'reasons', 'other', 'DVD', 'assorted', 'collection', 'True', 'have', 'commented', 'here', 'not', 'astutely', 'portrayal', 'Zen', 'Buddhism', 'might', 'be', 'explicated', 'truest', 'sense', 'dogmas', 'How', 'would', 'depict', 'encapsulate', 'essence', 'Zen', 'modality', 'visual', 'i.e.', 'movie', 'experience', 'anyway', 'Pretty', 'tall', 'order', 'even', 'Buddha', 'would', 'imagine', 'movie', 'however', 'catalyst', 'SOME', 'things', 'are', 'related', 'Zen', 'Buddhism', 'overall', 'stage', 'affords', 'visual', 'meditative', 'experience', 'be', 'akin', 'Zen', 'Buddhism', 'something', 'other', 'even', 'Christianity', 'Needless', 'say', 'not', 'film', 'everyone', 'not', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Movies', 'genre', 'just', 'touches', 'deep', 'esoteric', 'psychological', 'spiritual', 'way', 'Perhaps', 'movie', 'something', 'what', 'Paul', 'Valery', 'stated', 'see', 'forget', 'name', 'thing', 'one']",Why Has Bodhi-Dharma Left for the East VHS

393661,AY3AVLL5IWW9,6303968384,Russell Fanelli,"[60, 62]","Those viewers wanting an entertaining evening at the movies may wish to stop reading this review now. Why Has Bodhi-Dharma Left for the East? is not an entertainment in any traditional sense. The purpose of this film is to help us make connections with the world as it is.  As we patiently watch the screen we may be gently or not so gently startled by what we experience.  It may be that what we thought we knew we see truly for the first time.Korean director Bae Yong-Kyun accomplishes this awakening in three ways.  First he presents a story of two monks and a young orphan boy.  The old Zen master, Hyegok, rescued the boy, Haejin from poverty in the city and brought the boy to a Zen mountain retreat to live.  The young novice monk, Kibong, leaves his blind mother in the city to seek enlightenment.  Kibong is directed by a Zen priest to go to the mountain retreat to assist the old master, who is dying.  The master instructs his student and the young boy with few words, the example of his own life, and an occasional sharp remonstrance.One important lesson the master teaches is the illusion of self and the interconnectedness of all beings.  Suffering arises from the false desires of the self.  The novice suffers deeply because he is confused about the right action to take and the purpose of his life.  He feels guilt for having left his blind mother.  At one point the novice goes down the mountain to buy medicine for the master in the city.  He looks in on his mother without announcing himself and then quietly leaves her alone.  He has made the decision to care for his master, not his mother.The orphan has his own story.  What little action takes place in this film centers on the activity of the boy.  First, he throws a rock and stuns a bird which falls in the water.  He quickly retrieves the bird and tries to nurse it back to health.  Next, he himself is almost drowned by a group of boys who continue to dunk him under water as a screams in his fear and anguish.  Soon after his encounter with the boys, he is standing on a rock face above the water and he is startled by the mate of the bird he wounded.  He falls from the rock into the water and almost drowns.  At the last moment he relaxes completely and begins to float.The screech of the bird directs us to the second important element in the film.  Sound is carefully used to bring us back to attention from our slumbers.  This movie is so quiet and peaceful at times that we may be so relaxed we begin to doze off.  The scream of the boy in the water, the screech of the bird, the gong struck by the novice, even the opening frame of the film in which the noise of a train passing alerts us to pay attention to all that will follow.The peace I mentioned directs us to the final ingredient to be discussed.  This film takes place in the beautiful mountains of Korea.  Wind and water, fire and air, forests and fields are all lovingly shown and tell their own story of change and interconnectedness.  For much of 137 minutes we watch from the mountain top the beauty of the world unfold before us.  The master directs the attention of his novice to the breathtaking beauty and reality of what is right there for him to experience.After my first viewing of Bodhi-Dharma, I waited a couple of days and then picked a quiet time to watch the film again.  The elements I have mentioned in this review became more clear with the second viewing.  This is one of those films that repay study for those who want to understand director Bae Yong-Kyun's vision.  Why has Bodhi-Dharma Left for the East? is his only film and it was seven years or more in the making.  This film justly deserves the praise and attention it has received.

Jung ""Barbie""","[11, 18]","When I was in Korea about ten years ago, I heard about this movie, but I have not seen this move until DVD is released recently.This movie is not for everyone, because it is hard to understand Zen and other underlying  stories (also the cinematography). I am not a Buddhist, but I think I know  better than usual Western viewers. Keep in mind that my review is of  novice.At first scene, you hear very loud warning sounds from traffic  signals and sounds of a train passing by. The sounds from wooden bells  carried by Buddhists have been used to open the closed minds of common  people (fools) by the strong wave energy penetrating into their inner  minds. You later hear sounds of the wooden bell by the monk in the market.  Also, you can hear various sounds from metallic bells and others in the  movie.The Zen koan is also used to open the closed mind by sudden  striking force. You can not easily escape from old habits, stereotypes and  various beliefs which you have accumulated and learned after your birth. To  cut those connections which are usually obstacles to the Way to  enlightenment, you need some sudden and strong force. A sound or koan can  be used for this purpose.'Karma' is a basic principle to make the story  in the movie. The boy killed a bird. He later suffered in water. The cow  symbolizes a kind of lucky guider when you are struggling to escape from  darkness. Due to any kind of guider, you can have a chance to move toward  the enlightenment or Nirvana, which is given because you have accomplished  somethings or have helped other lives during the past life.The woman  wearing black Korean cloth is the boy's mother. She appeared in the dream  of the boy when he struggled to escape from a crisis. I could not interpret  who is the woman who danced when the old monk (master) was to pass  away.There are other 'karma' stories overlapping each other, but I could  not interpret all of them. I believe I can understand most of stories,  after seeing the movie several times more.What is the answer to the  title, &quot;Why Has Bodhi-Dharma Left for the East?&quot;.

Were they seperate, I think this movie would get just about 5 stars hands down, each time. Of course it is a movie for those interested in Zen Buddhism, that is somewhat a given. I am sorry to hear that the DVD conversion did not work out well, but I suppose I consider myself lucky enough to have purchased the VHS anyway. The imagery, for one, is so penetrating. I don't really know how to describe it. Impermamance is a recurring theme within this movie. The thing I appreciate about it, is it truly is like &quot;viewing a meditation.&quot; The film is very relaxing, allowing the imagery to tell the story mostly. It is Korean subtitled, featuring a master, monk, and an orphaned boy. I wish I could tell you what this movie is about entirely, but I would not be able to do so in a completely accurate way. It's a movie that really does not collect dust on a shelf, because it is so provoking you will watch it over and over again.
