For years I've had the film on a crummy video cassette but now I can enjoy it fully.  This is like fine wine.  It only gets better with age.Molly McGrath, a school coach is hooked into going to Central High, a school full of underachieving, smart mouth criminals and losers to teach Central's failing football team. Unfortunately their best quarter back LeVander has turned street criminal so the principal ( Nipsie Russell ) hopes McGrath is the new blood needed to win some games. Of course Molly is confronted by the team's hostility at first but when they notice she has a real talent for football and grew up on the sport, they start to respect her. Molly never backs down proving once again that anything a man can do a woman can do better.  The story moves smoothly except for the boring plot line dealing with Molly's eldest daughter, constantly acting out to get attention.  Also the big plot hole is how Molly managed to turn the Central Wildcats into the Dallas Cowboys without explanation. One minute they're the worst team in the district, the next thing we know they're winning the championship!  Go figure. Since this is a comedy overlooking plot holes won't slow up the fun. The highlights are Trumaine ( Wesley Snipes ) who is so disgustingly funny you'll be shocked at some of the things he says. Cerullo's uh...talent ( if you call flatulence a talent ). Flatulence in films wasn't over done in 86' when this is made so it was funny then. It may not be funny to people ( including myself ) who are sick of flatulance being relied on for films of today. And my number one favorite...Finch! The four-hundred pound genius with an attitude!  All the actors have chemistry with each other and keep the ball rolling.  James Keach is funny as Molly's ex-husband who's constantly sticking his nose where it doesn't belong.Wildcats has all the components of a great film: cute jocks, humor, a witty actress and all around good clean 80's fun.  What amazes me about this is that it doesn't seem that dated even though its nineteen years old. Some 80's films lose their spark but Wildcats is funnier than ever. I never tire of the football sequences or the players' funny catch lines such as: "" If they're the cougars, how come they got a goat? ""  "" What are we b------- about? We got a dog dressed like a cat.""Wildcats is Goldie's best movie in my opinion. I liked Overboard but with this Goldie really came into her own. There are a lot of emerging actors from this film such as Wesley Snipes, Woody Harrelson and not to mention the cute cameo from LL. Cool J. Also the man who plays Cerullo is a major hottie! And who can forget the cute little rap song the team does at the end? If you're into light humor or find yourself at home with nothing to do, Wildcats is the perfect movie to just throw in the DVD player and relax. There's no thinking required. The only thing you must have is a sense of humor and the need for two hours of fun-loving entertainment for the entire family ( despite a couple curse words ). Enjoy. And if you haven't seen it, BUY IT!If you enjoy Wildcats you'll love other funny films of this genre:Sunset ParkHardballThe Bad News BearsA League of their OwnAll of these films are good but Wildcats is in a place all its own.",4,One of the Best of its Genre!,1109721600,"03 2, 2005",2005,3332,"['first', 'saw', 'when', 'was', 'child', ""'m"", '27', 'now', 'just', 'bought', 'DVD', 'years', ""'ve"", 'had', 'film', 'crummy', 'video', 'cassette', 'now', 'can', 'enjoy', 'fully', 'like', 'fine', 'wine', 'only', 'better', 'age.Molly', 'McGrath', 'school', 'coach', 'hooked', 'going', 'Central', 'High', 'school', 'full', 'underachieving', 'smart', 'mouth', 'criminals', 'losers', 'teach', 'Central', 'failing', 'football', 'team', 'Unfortunately', 'best', 'quarter', 'back', 'LeVander', 'turned', 'street', 'criminal', 'principal', 'Nipsie', 'Russell', 'McGrath', 'new', 'blood', 'needed', 'win', 'games', 'course', 'Molly', 'confronted', 'team', 'hostility', 'first', 'when', 'notice', 'real', 'talent', 'football', 'grew', 'up', 'sport', 'start', 'respect', 'Molly', 'never', 'down', 'proving', 'once', 'again', 'anything', 'man', 'can', 'do', 'woman', 'can', 'do', 'better', 'story', 'smoothly', 'boring', 'plot', 'line', 'dealing', 'Molly', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'constantly', 'acting', 'out', 'get', 'attention', 'Also', 'big', 'plot', 'hole', 'how', 'Molly', 'managed', 'turn', 'Central', 'Wildcats', 'Dallas', 'Cowboys', 'explanation', 'One', 'minute', ""'re"", 'worst', 'team', 'district', 'next', 'thing', 'know', ""'re"", 'winning', 'championship', 'Go', 'figure', 'comedy', 'overlooking', 'plot', 'holes', 'wo', ""n't"", 'slow', 'up', 'fun', 'highlights', 'are', 'Trumaine', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'who', 'so', 'disgustingly', 'funny', ""'ll"", 'be', 'shocked', 'things', 'Cerullo', 'uh', 'talent', 'call', 'flatulence', 'talent', 'Flatulence', 'films', 'was', ""n't"", 'done', '86', 'when', 'made', 'was', 'funny', 'then', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'funny', 'people', 'including', 'who', 'are', 'sick', 'flatulance', 'being', 'relied', 'films', 'today', 'number', 'one', 'favorite', 'Finch', 'four-hundred', 'pound', 'genius', 'attitude', 'actors', 'have', 'chemistry', 'other', 'keep', 'ball', 'rolling', 'James', 'Keach', 'funny', 'Molly', 'ex-husband', 'who', 'constantly', 'sticking', 'nose', 'where', ""n't"", 'belong.Wildcats', 'components', 'great', 'film', 'cute', 'jocks', 'humor', 'witty', 'actress', 'around', 'good', 'clean', '80', 'fun', 'What', ""n't"", 'seem', 'dated', 'even', 'nineteen', 'years', 'old', '80', 'films', 'lose', 'spark', 'Wildcats', 'funnier', 'ever', 'never', 'tire', 'football', 'players', 'funny', 'catch', 'lines', 'such', ""'re"", 'cougars', 'how', 'come', 'got', 'goat', 'What', 'are', 'b', 'got', 'dog', 'dressed', 'cat', 'Wildcats', 'Goldie', 'best', 'movie', 'opinion', 'liked', 'Overboard', 'Goldie', 'really', 'came', 'own', 'are', 'lot', 'emerging', 'actors', 'film', 'such', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'not', 'mention', 'cute', 'cameo', 'LL', 'Cool', 'J', 'Also', 'man', 'who', 'Cerullo', 'major', 'hottie', 'who', 'can', 'forget', 'cute', 'little', 'rap', 'song', 'team', 'end', ""'re"", 'light', 'humor', 'find', 'home', 'nothing', 'do', 'Wildcats', 'perfect', 'movie', 'just', 'throw', 'DVD', 'player', 'relax', 'thinking', 'required', 'only', 'thing', 'must', 'have', 'sense', 'humor', 'need', 'two', 'hours', 'fun-loving', 'entertainment', 'entire', 'family', 'couple', 'curse', 'words', 'Enjoy', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'BUY', 'IT', 'enjoy', ""'ll"", 'love', 'other', 'funny', 'films', 'genre', 'Sunset', 'ParkHardballThe', 'Bad', 'News', 'BearsA', 'League', 'OwnAll', 'films', 'are', 'good', 'Wildcats', 'place', 'own']",N/A
