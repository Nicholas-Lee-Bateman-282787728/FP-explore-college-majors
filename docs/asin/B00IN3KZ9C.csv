1694607,A12SXDIXSHVJ2L,B00IN3KZ9C,LuckyDan,"[0, 0]","Billy Joel is one my favorite musicians so I was looking forward to watching this DVD. I was under the impression that the BLU-RAY version of this ALSO contained the documentary that aired on Showtime back in February. It doesn't..and that's my misunderstanding - my fault. I also figured that the audio would be available in 5.1 DTS since just about everything I've bought regarding music concerts in the last couple of years have had that option. It doesn't. Only stereo. I think this release could've been so much better than this. I guess if you want the documentary you MUST purchase the &#34;Deluxe Edition&#34;, It's a great concert but I'm left a bit disappointed.",3,Billy Joel is one my favorite musicians so I was looking forward to watching this ...,1405296000,"07 14, 2014",2014,672,"['Billy', 'Joel', 'one', 'favorite', 'musicians', 'so', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'watching', 'DVD', 'was', 'impression', 'BLU-RAY', 'version', 'ALSO', 'contained', 'documentary', 'aired', 'Showtime', 'back', 'February', 'misunderstanding', 'fault', 'also', 'figured', 'audio', 'would', 'be', 'available', '5.1', 'DTS', 'just', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'bought', 'regarding', 'music', 'concerts', 'last', 'couple', 'years', 'have', 'had', 'option', ""n't"", 'Only', 'stereo', 'think', 'release', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'guess', 'want', 'documentary', 'MUST', 'purchase', '34', 'Deluxe', 'Edition', '34', 'great', 'concert', ""'m"", 'left', 'bit', 'disappointed']",A Matter of Trust: The Bridge to Russia: The Concert
