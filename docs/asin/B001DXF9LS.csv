This concert was taped from two separate shows early in Tori's career. You can see how more comfortable she is as a live performer in the 1992 show, she is a riveting artist when she is in her element, live Tori is the best! Winter, Silent All These Years, Smells Like Teen Spirit, and Thank You are performed with sincerity and beauty. I highly recommend this flawless purchase, enjoy!",5,"""Yes I know what you think of me - you never shut-up...""",1224460800,"10 20, 2008",2008,466,"['Live', 'Montreux', 'live', 'concert', 'singer/songwriter', 'genius', 'Tori', 'Amos', 'concert', 'was', 'taped', 'two', 'separate', 'shows', 'early', 'Tori', 'career', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'more', 'comfortable', 'live', 'performer', '1992', 'show', 'riveting', 'artist', 'when', 'element', 'live', 'Tori', 'best', 'Winter', 'Silent', 'All', 'Years', 'Smells', 'Teen', 'Spirit', 'Thank', 'are', 'performed', 'sincerity', 'beauty', 'highly', 'recommend', 'flawless', 'purchase', 'enjoy']",N/A

At least guitar, bass, and drums, maybe even some backing vocalists, and/or strings. I guess I was hoping for a more precise recreation of her wonderful in-studio sound which is usually flawless. Instead Tori performed a one-woman show. Just Tori, her pianos, and an intimate audience on a smaller stage at the Montreux Jazz Festival. Being all alone onstage did allow Tori's personality and charm to shine through however, and the show, while not what I expected, was still very entertaining, if shorter than expected. Of course I suppose that was to be expected as Tori only had two albums released at the time. The second show from 1992 was much like the first from 1991, even many of the songs were repeated, a little disappointing as well as they were performed. Tori's penchant for covering Led Zeppelin showed her affection for their music, and gave one an impression of what that band may have sounded like with a much higher caliber singer of Tori's talent instead of Bobby Plant's androgynous bisexual stage persona and lack of vocal range and presence.My only criticism would concern the 1991 concert. Tori should have something done about her feminine moustache which was somewhat discomforting not only on a large screen, but especially in high definition. Wasn't Tori advised she was going to be on camera that night? Apparently someone must have brought this little oversight to Tori's attention by the time of the second performance. Her performance in 1992 was obviously more polished thanks to the experience of a year's touring, and  maturity, and her confidence showed. All in all beautiful music very well performed by the one and only red and ravenous Tori Amos!",4,Not What I Eexpected (but not necessarily a bad thing),1398297600,"04 24, 2014",2014,1787,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'reason', 'was', 'expecting', 'hoping', 'Tori', 'be', 'backed', 'up', 'band', 'least', 'guitar', 'bass', 'drums', 'maybe', 'even', 'backing', 'vocalists', 'and/or', 'strings', 'guess', 'was', 'hoping', 'more', 'precise', 'recreation', 'wonderful', 'in-studio', 'sound', 'usually', 'flawless', 'Instead', 'Tori', 'performed', 'one-woman', 'show', 'Just', 'Tori', 'pianos', 'intimate', 'audience', 'smaller', 'stage', 'Montreux', 'Jazz', 'Festival', 'Being', 'alone', 'onstage', 'did', 'allow', 'Tori', 'personality', 'charm', 'shine', 'however', 'show', 'not', 'what', 'expected', 'was', 'still', 'very', 'entertaining', 'shorter', 'expected', 'course', 'suppose', 'was', 'be', 'expected', 'Tori', 'only', 'had', 'two', 'albums', 'released', 'time', 'second', 'show', '1992', 'was', 'much', 'first', '1991', 'even', 'many', 'songs', 'were', 'repeated', 'little', 'disappointing', 'as', 'well', 'were', 'performed', 'Tori', 'penchant', 'covering', 'Led', 'Zeppelin', 'showed', 'affection', 'music', 'gave', 'one', 'impression', 'what', 'band', 'may', 'have', 'sounded', 'much', 'higher', 'caliber', 'singer', 'Tori', 'talent', 'instead', 'Bobby', 'Plant', 'androgynous', 'bisexual', 'stage', 'persona', 'lack', 'vocal', 'range', 'presence.My', 'only', 'criticism', 'would', 'concern', '1991', 'concert', 'Tori', 'should', 'have', 'something', 'done', 'feminine', 'moustache', 'was', 'somewhat', 'discomforting', 'not', 'only', 'large', 'screen', 'especially', 'high', 'definition', 'Was', ""n't"", 'Tori', 'advised', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'camera', 'night', 'Apparently', 'someone', 'must', 'have', 'brought', 'little', 'oversight', 'Tori', 'attention', 'time', 'second', 'performance', 'performance', '1992', 'was', 'obviously', 'more', 'polished', 'thanks', 'experience', 'year', 'touring', 'maturity', 'confidence', 'showed', 'beautiful', 'music', 'very', 'well', 'performed', 'one', 'only', 'red', 'ravenous', 'Tori', 'Amos']",N/A

I have the Yes and ELP and Jethro Tull performances too.Something about Tori if you like her music gets under your skin, and her singing ""live"" adds to it when you see her facial expressions. She lives her music.I discovered her by accident, and it turned out to be a happy accident. When you listen to songs like Winter, and you listen to it three times in a row, it must be a good song.I like her energy, the way the music and words flow, and entertain while drawing you in to her stories reflected through her music.

But for those of us that got completely and utterly hooked and obsessed with Tori in 1991, this is for US.  I've had the Montreux CD for many years now and although I enjoy it very much, I had not been prepared to have such an emotional reaction as I did for the accompanying visuals on this Blu-ray.  First of all, the DTS Master Audio sounds phenomenal (the Dolby Digital and PCM stereo also sound good too).  The picture is a little grainy during a few times but for the vast majority it looks AWESOME on my Mitsubishi 65"" DLP.  I can't imagine the DVD would be less than similarly superb, although I don't own that version.What really surprised me is that her 1991 performance was so outstanding.  This particular performance wasn't very fulfilling for me on the CD but after WATCHING it, it gave me a whole new perspective.  While she has been described as ""timid"" by others, for me she looks ""shy"", which I think is a WONDERFUL thing.  I've seen Tori live probably at least a few dozen times.  Some shows she has completely disappointed me and others I was in an emotional elation beyond words.  Unfortunately, as time has gone by these emotional highs have gotten fewer and farther in between.  Not that I don't enjoy Tori today, but it was her earlier work that captured my heart.  This recording takes me back to that time.  Those of you that understand what I'm talking about will totally understand where I'm coming from.My high points were Upside Down and Thank You.  Even after loving Tori for 20 years, the proof of her ability to take me to a wonderful place in my heart is evidenced by the fact that even today while watching this performance, it still brought plenty of tears to my eyes and cheeks.Thanks, Tori for making this wonderful show available on Blu-ray.

THIS is the best of the Tori DVD's out there, in my opinion - it's just her and her piano, sans band, the way she really needs to be heard.  A talented & unique artist (for my money, there's no one out there quite like her), performing great material, showcasing her 'chops'.  90 minutes, from two different years, covering mostly Earthquakes but with some covers thrown in.  The picture is crisp (from video source - it was early hi-def), sound is excellent, and the camerawork and editing is top-notch.  This is a real gem from the Montreaux vaults - one of the better titles in a series that has already brought us some really good performances on DVD.
