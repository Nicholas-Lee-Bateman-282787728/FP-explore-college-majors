802868,A1PID2MT8MMPAF,B0001EQICE,"A. Griffiths ""Adrian""","[0, 1]","This third move based on The Brady Bunch TV seems to have fallen off the radar spectacularly, which isn't surprising if you have seen it. It's an ultra cheap, poorly written quickie that fails to live up to the first two films in any way at all. Here, the Brady family become America's first family when Mike is elected president.That plot aside, the most shocking thing is that apart from Gary Cole and Shelly Long reprising their roles as the parents, all the rest of the main cast (the six children and Alice) are now played by different actors. This means that the whole movie looks like an imposter, with 80% the original characters replaced but still trying to maintain the illusion that we are actually watching the same Brady family. The actors playing the six children seem to be making a brave stab at things, but its very obvious that rather then caricaturing the original TV show cast, they are trying to mimic the cast who weere doing the caricatures in the first two Brady Bunch movies.Most of the children are forgettable, but the biggest loss is not having Jennifer Elise Cox as Jan Brady, which was originally a demented re-working of the TV character, but here, the actress playing Jan simply mimics all the mannerisms of Jennifer's performance rather than playing Jan Brady at all. I would presume that the script is to blame here as she has all the same types of lines and is (presumably) told to grimace, pout, and walk with her hair swinging from side to side just as the character did in the other movies. Equally jarring is the replacement actress who plays Alice, who seem to contort her face wildly and jerk about like a robot in an attempt to become a doppelganger of Henriette Mantel's version. Marcia just seems annoying rather than foxy, Greg is like someone wearing a fancy-dress costuime of Greg, and Cindy is totally unrecognisable. The only pair that come off unscathed are Bobby and Peter, and that's because, well, nobody is interested in Bobby and Peter!Even Shelley Long and Gary Cole seem to sleepwalk through their scripts. Shelly Long in particular seems to have lost any warmth she had, and the script gives neither of them any decent lines or jokes to work with.The threadbare plot hardly seems to matter when you're watching such a creepy cast of bodysnatchers trying to resurrect an originally funny franchise. No wonder it sank without a trace. I would advise you not to spend money on this one, and only watch if you have a morbid curiosity.",1,Miss,1327449600,"01 25, 2012",2012,2488,"['third', 'move', 'based', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'TV', 'have', 'fallen', 'off', 'radar', 'spectacularly', ""n't"", 'surprising', 'have', 'seen', 'ultra', 'cheap', 'poorly', 'written', 'quickie', 'live', 'up', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'way', 'Here', 'Brady', 'family', 'become', 'America', 'first', 'family', 'when', 'Mike', 'elected', 'plot', 'aside', 'most', 'shocking', 'thing', 'apart', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'Shelly', 'Long', 'reprising', 'roles', 'parents', 'rest', 'main', 'cast', 'six', 'children', 'Alice', 'are', 'now', 'played', 'different', 'actors', 'whole', 'movie', 'imposter', '80', '%', 'original', 'characters', 'replaced', 'still', 'trying', 'maintain', 'illusion', 'are', 'actually', 'watching', 'same', 'Brady', 'family', 'actors', 'playing', 'six', 'children', 'seem', 'be', 'making', 'brave', 'stab', 'things', 'very', 'obvious', 'rather', 'then', 'caricaturing', 'original', 'TV', 'show', 'cast', 'are', 'trying', 'mimic', 'cast', 'who', 'doing', 'caricatures', 'first', 'two', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'movies.Most', 'children', 'are', 'forgettable', 'biggest', 'loss', 'not', 'having', 'Jennifer', 'Elise', 'Cox', 'Jan', 'Brady', 'was', 'originally', 'demented', 're-working', 'TV', 'character', 'here', 'actress', 'playing', 'Jan', 'simply', 'mannerisms', 'Jennifer', 'performance', 'rather', 'playing', 'Jan', 'Brady', 'would', 'presume', 'script', 'blame', 'here', 'same', 'types', 'lines', 'presumably', 'told', 'grimace', 'pout', 'walk', 'hair', 'swinging', 'side', 'side', 'just', 'character', 'did', 'other', 'movies', 'Equally', 'jarring', 'replacement', 'actress', 'who', 'Alice', 'who', 'seem', 'contort', 'face', 'wildly', 'jerk', 'robot', 'attempt', 'become', 'doppelganger', 'Henriette', 'Mantel', 'version', 'Marcia', 'just', 'annoying', 'rather', 'foxy', 'Greg', 'someone', 'wearing', 'fancy-dress', 'costuime', 'Greg', 'Cindy', 'totally', 'unrecognisable', 'only', 'pair', 'come', 'unscathed', 'are', 'Bobby', 'Peter', 'because', 'well', 'nobody', 'interested', 'Bobby', 'Peter', 'Even', 'Shelley', 'Long', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'seem', 'sleepwalk', 'scripts', 'Shelly', 'Long', 'particular', 'have', 'lost', 'warmth', 'had', 'script', 'decent', 'lines', 'jokes', 'work', 'with.The', 'threadbare', 'plot', 'hardly', 'matter', 'when', ""'re"", 'watching', 'such', 'creepy', 'cast', 'bodysnatchers', 'trying', 'resurrect', 'originally', 'funny', 'franchise', 'wonder', 'sank', 'trace', 'would', 'advise', 'not', 'spend', 'money', 'one', 'only', 'watch', 'have', 'morbid', 'curiosity']",N/A

If the world was to end tomorrow, three things would still be here. Cockroaches, Cher, and the brood from Clinton Way. The Brady's. Our favorite ployester pests return in this made for TV movie that aired during Thanksgiving of 2002. The tele-film followed in the steps of the two recent big screen adventures, but the fun and hilariousness that made those two films, especially the first one, hysterical and endearing, did not cross over this hodepodge of a film. Bobby Brady finds a lottery ticket and takes it home. The ticket turns out to be the winning one with a grand prize of $67 million. But Mike, being Mike, refuses to keep it and tries to find the rightful owner. Because of his good deed, he is to meet the President. Through some situations, Mike becomes the President Of The United States himself and the first family of TV become the first family of the country. There were many chances here to do something, but the writers play it safe and the situation never rises to what it could of been. Speaking of writing, you know it is not going to be much when it is written by a Schwartz. Lloyd, that is. He tries to mimic the writing and feel of the spoofy big screen adaptions, but he never aces it. The writers of those films wrote it with a sure hand, but he just comes across as an old fashioned ""Brady' writer trying to be hip and self aware. The only good thing this missfire has going for it is the return of Shelley Long and Gary Cole as Carol and Mike Brady. Their association with the project bring that level of hilarity and spark to the proceedings. The kids are not good. The kids are all new, and not that impressive. Jan and Marcia do okay, but the rest leave a lot to be desired. The actress playing Marcia has the uppity up persona of Marcia down pretty well, and has the right kind of 'tease' to her performance like Christine Taylor did in the movies, but she is still no equal. Jan had the mannerisms right, but it seemed too forced. The actor playing Greg isn't playing Greg. He's playing Christopher Daniel Barnes playing Greg Brady. And Alice. I don't know what they were thinking when they cast this actress to play Alice. You will know what I mean when you get a look at her. Veteran actor Saul Rubineck appears in the film as a White House aid with plans of his own, and why he agreed to do this film I have no idea. But most of all, it didn't feel right to be out of the Brady home. But that's just me. All in all, a very weak and disappointing effort in the Brady cannon.

The Brady parents from the first two theatrical release movies: Gary Cole & Shelley Long are in this TV movie recreating their roles.  NEW Alice the maid, NEW Brady Kids.

I actually have no disagreement on that point.I have a big disagreement with how Mr. Brady finds himself in the White House. The Brady Bunch was built on a foundation of cheese, but their White House occupancy is a new level of absurdity.We never see Mike getting elected or undergoing any of the constitutional procedures which people are supposed to go through on their way to becoming the president. Don't tell me that everybody in the government is either so unethical or mysteriously gone that a California architect has to save the country. An eight year old could easily see through this movie's script.I usually like political movies of all types, but this one even had me instead longing for the dentist's chair. It looks like a red, white, and blue version of the ill-fated variety hour (which was made with the television cast).Greedy entertainment executives were placing the 'Brady Bunch' image on a product without first wondering if the overall concept was reasonably consistent with the tone and image of the original series.

Shelly Long and Gary Cole made great Mike and Carol Bradys, and the actors and actresses who played the Brady Kids were funny and memorable.Sadly, this third entry into the Brady Movie 'trilogy' is horrible, at best.  Gary Cole and Shelly Long have to work with weak dialogue, a lame storyline, and a supporting cast that you wished could have stayed locked away in the Presidential Bunker for a long time.  I think the only non-veteran actor or actress in the film that went on to something successful was one of the girls at Marcia's slumber party, who's currently in that irritating McDonald's commercial with that guy who can't find his Happy Meal toy.I'm surprised that this film was even allowed to be broadcast on TV, it was so wretched.
