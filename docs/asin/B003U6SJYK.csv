Jeff Daniels is an actor that I have liked for a long time, and have seen him in many things. Although, in this film he plays one of my favorite characters that I have ever seen. In this movie, he is so odd, and very interesting. He was wonderful in this film. Now to Ryan Reynolds. Ryan did great in this film also, there was a ton of dark comedic relief from his character which I loved. Ryan Reynolds is a very versatile actor and he proves that in this movie. If you don't like Ryan Reynolds after this film, you don't know what you are talking about. Also, Emma Stone does a stellar job tying it all together.

1363137,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B003U6SJYK,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[0, 0]","Paper Man is a beautiful, quirky, strange movie that jumped up out of left field and grabbed me. I loved this film; it is what good independent film is all about.It is very difficult to describe this film, or talk about what is so great; other than to say, the last 15 minutes of this film are the huge pay off. In a few quiet, simple shots, the directors Kieran and Michele Mulroney bring the story to an unpredictable conclusion. I was both happy and sad at the conclusion of this film.Richard Dunn published a book, and apparently has writer's block. His wife, Dr. Dunn, drives him to a small cottage in a seaside town (Montauk, Long Island) so that he can concentrate on his writing. As Richard sits in the car, Captain Excellent shows up to tell him he senses trouble. It's clear; something isn't exactly 100% right with Richard. Eventually his wife leaves and Richard rides a tiny Sting Ray bicycle into town. He meets Abby, a troubled high school student. The film forges ahead from there, exploring the relationship between Abby and Richard.The film is almost two hours long. Many times I found myself thinking, this will end badly, no this will end very badly. About an hour and a half into the film, I found myself a little bit bored with the film, trying to figure out where it was going to end. Once the ending comes around about fifteen minutes later, it is clear this film is exactly the correct length.Technically, this is not an outstanding film. The camera work is fairly sloppy. But it redeems itself just shortly after the big reveal in the last 15 minutes of the film. There is a montage with the most precise perfect framing that represents the character standing on the precipice of death and life (the rafters forming a type of cathedral around Abby the main character).The soundtrack of this film is incredible. This is some of the best independent music I've heard in a film in a very long time. Mark McAdam is the primary performer, the songs are acoustic, alternative sound (Paper Man Songs). The soundtrack reminded me of Middle Brother, Delta Spirit, Deer Tick, and Dawes - not as upbeat as these guys, but in the same genre.The film is perfectly cast. Jeff Daniels has played this role before, the confused author in The Answer Man (The Answer Man) and The Squid and the Whale (The Squid and the Whale (Special Edition)). But I still love the way he plays this role - he is a natural. Ryan Reynolds deserves something special for playing Mr. Excellent. How they got him to put on that tight blue suit, dye his hair white, and play such a dead pan funny role is amazing. There is absolutely no evidence of Van Wilder anywhere in this film (National Lampoon's Van Wilder (Unrated Two-Disc Edition)). Emma Stone has the most incredible piercing blue eyes in this film. She is a beautiful confused young woman. My only criticism of her acting, at times she seemed a bit older than a high school student - 16 to 18 years old. She was 20 years old at the time of filming. Lisa Kudrow was great as the anal control freak wife, Dr. Dunn. Fortunately, she had a smaller part in the film. I'm afraid if she had been in the film much more, Phoebe would have come back. Kieran Culkin does an excellent job playing the sulking dark Christopher. He brings a lot to a pivotal but small part. He was outstanding in Igby Goes Down (Igby Goes Down).The film is rated R. There is a lot of strong language. There are several references to smoking a J, and underage kids are shown drinking. The film touched emotionally on the theme of death, and some could interpret the relationship between Richard and Abby as inappropriate (they would be wrong, but it is possible to see that). There was no nudity and no blood or gore (well a fish gets hacked up pretty mercilessly). I would suggest that this film is appropriate for a more mature younger viewer.This film is almost the definition of quirky. There are a lot of independent films made that are just strange to be strange; this is not one of those films. Perfectly casted - Jeff Daniels and Emma Stone are a pleasure to watch - beautiful music, and a wonderful message; this is a film well worth watching.",5,Quirky Good,1325721600,"01 5, 2012",2012,4167,"['Paper', 'Man', 'beautiful', 'quirky', 'strange', 'movie', 'jumped', 'up', 'left', 'field', 'grabbed', 'loved', 'film', 'what', 'good', 'independent', 'film', 'about.It', 'very', 'difficult', 'describe', 'film', 'talk', 'what', 'so', 'great', 'other', 'say', 'last', '15', 'minutes', 'film', 'are', 'huge', 'pay', 'off', 'few', 'quiet', 'simple', 'shots', 'directors', 'Kieran', 'Michele', 'Mulroney', 'bring', 'story', 'unpredictable', 'conclusion', 'was', 'happy', 'sad', 'conclusion', 'film.Richard', 'Dunn', 'published', 'book', 'apparently', 'writer', 'block', 'wife', 'Dr.', 'Dunn', 'small', 'cottage', 'seaside', 'town', 'Montauk', 'Long', 'Island', 'so', 'can', 'concentrate', 'writing', 'Richard', 'car', 'Captain', 'Excellent', 'up', 'tell', 'trouble', 'clear', 'something', ""n't"", 'exactly', '100', '%', 'right', 'Richard', 'Eventually', 'wife', 'leaves', 'Richard', 'tiny', 'Sting', 'Ray', 'bicycle', 'town', 'Abby', 'troubled', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'film', 'forges', 'ahead', 'there', 'exploring', 'relationship', 'Abby', 'Richard.The', 'film', 'almost', 'two', 'hours', 'long', 'Many', 'times', 'found', 'thinking', 'will', 'end', 'badly', 'will', 'end', 'very', 'badly', 'hour', 'half', 'film', 'found', 'little', 'bit', 'bored', 'film', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'where', 'was', 'going', 'end', 'ending', 'around', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'later', 'clear', 'film', 'exactly', 'correct', 'length.Technically', 'not', 'outstanding', 'film', 'camera', 'work', 'fairly', 'sloppy', 'just', 'shortly', 'big', 'reveal', 'last', '15', 'minutes', 'film', 'montage', 'most', 'precise', 'perfect', 'framing', 'character', 'standing', 'precipice', 'death', 'life', 'rafters', 'forming', 'type', 'cathedral', 'Abby', 'main', 'character', 'soundtrack', 'film', 'incredible', 'best', 'independent', 'music', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'film', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'Mark', 'McAdam', 'primary', 'performer', 'songs', 'are', 'acoustic', 'alternative', 'sound', 'Paper', 'Man', 'Songs', 'soundtrack', 'reminded', 'Middle', 'Brother', 'Delta', 'Spirit', 'Deer', 'Tick', 'Dawes', 'not', 'as', 'upbeat', 'guys', 'same', 'genre.The', 'film', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'played', 'role', 'confused', 'author', 'Answer', 'Man', 'Answer', 'Man', 'Squid', 'Whale', 'Squid', 'Whale', 'Special', 'Edition', 'still', 'love', 'way', 'role', 'natural', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'something', 'special', 'playing', 'Mr', 'Excellent', 'How', 'got', 'put', 'tight', 'blue', 'suit', 'dye', 'hair', 'white', 'play', 'such', 'dead', 'pan', 'funny', 'role', 'amazing', 'absolutely', 'evidence', 'Van', 'Wilder', 'anywhere', 'film', 'National', 'Lampoon', 'Van', 'Wilder', 'Unrated', 'Two-Disc', 'Edition', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'most', 'incredible', 'piercing', 'blue', 'eyes', 'film', 'beautiful', 'confused', 'young', 'woman', 'only', 'criticism', 'acting', 'times', 'seemed', 'bit', 'older', 'high', 'school', 'student', '16', '18', 'years', 'old', 'was', '20', 'years', 'old', 'time', 'filming', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'was', 'great', 'anal', 'control', 'freak', 'wife', 'Dr.', 'Dunn', 'Fortunately', 'had', 'smaller', 'part', 'film', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'had', 'been', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'Phoebe', 'would', 'have', 'come', 'back', 'Kieran', 'Culkin', 'excellent', 'job', 'playing', 'sulking', 'dark', 'Christopher', 'lot', 'pivotal', 'small', 'part', 'was', 'outstanding', 'Igby', 'Goes', 'Down', 'Igby', 'Goes', 'Down', '.The', 'film', 'rated', 'R.', 'lot', 'strong', 'language', 'are', 'several', 'references', 'smoking', 'J', 'underage', 'kids', 'are', 'shown', 'drinking', 'film', 'touched', 'emotionally', 'theme', 'death', 'could', 'interpret', 'relationship', 'Richard', 'Abby', 'inappropriate', 'would', 'be', 'wrong', 'possible', 'see', 'was', 'nudity', 'blood', 'gore', 'well', 'fish', 'hacked', 'up', 'pretty', 'mercilessly', 'would', 'suggest', 'film', 'appropriate', 'more', 'mature', 'younger', 'viewer.This', 'film', 'almost', 'definition', 'quirky', 'are', 'lot', 'independent', 'films', 'made', 'are', 'just', 'strange', 'be', 'strange', 'not', 'one', 'films', 'Perfectly', 'casted', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'are', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'beautiful', 'music', 'wonderful', 'message', 'film', 'well', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A
1363138,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B003U6SJYK,Eric Sanberg,"[1, 1]","This is an indy flick whose script must have impressed a lot of people because it sports a way decent cast. The casting paid off because, as good as the script is, they really work it.Here's the scoop. A writer (Jeff Daniels) with a failed first novel heads off to a rented house on Montauk with three months to meet the deadline on his next novel. He has an imaginary friend, Captain Excellence, (Ryan Reynolds) who he is trying to put to rest. His wife (Lisa Kudrow) is a surgeon who will visit most weekends. Emma stone is a local girl with troubles who agrees to babysit for him even though he has no kids. Jeff and Emma help each other through this rough patch in their lives.This is a cool flick. There are only a few sets so it's all writing and acting. Much of the script is very good and you really root for these folks. Sometimes people find themselves lost. They don't know how they got where they're at but now a certain panic and desperation set in and they want to find their way back. This is what is happening here. They don't try to help each other. They just do by who they are. It's the right things coming together at the right time. Captain Excellence has been with Jeff since childhood and Jeff knows he's gotta go. Emma has to shake a huge demon she's burdened with to realize she's better than the pile of garbage her ""boyfriend"" treats her like. I like Lisa Kudrow and I'm finally getting to the point I can see her without thinking of Phoebe. She's good here as she displays an increasing amount of frustration, then anger, at the way things are going. I'm also getting to like Emma Stone more and more. Her character is good here and pops THE biggest surprise in the movie. The production values are good enough. The music was OK but nothing exceptional. The opening song was disturbingly similar to Rodney Crowell's ""Earthbound."" I had visions of copyright lawyers dancing in my head.I can't say I ""got"" all the scenes and there were a few things that could have been done better. For instance, I didn't believe the party scene.

Daniels plays a quirky writer that smacks of some of his previous roles, less mentally challenged than in Dumb and Dumber and a more insecure and jumpy than in Arachnophobia.  He has writer's block and problems with his wife, making him ""every writer ever depicted in a movie."" The writers likewise cater to Reynolds' stylish character roots.  Of course, Reynolds often seems to play the same character whether he's killing vampires in Blade Trinity, scamming on girls in Buying the Cow, or testing his quippy limits when he got started on Two Guys, A Girl and a Pizza Place (sitcom).  In this case, he's a quippy, dashing superhero with crime-fighting muscles produced by Daniels' character's subconscious.  The banter between the two makes for excellent synergy.As I fail to find the point of this film, I enjoy some delightfully awkward scenes.  For example, Daniels' fumbling attempt to catch a fish for dinner, his personal bouts with a hideous couch, and some disturbing outdoor feng shui.But really, what's the meaning of all this?  Perhaps, that friendships may form unexpectedly.  Daniels and Emma Stone (Easy A, Crazy Stupid Love), playing his babysitter even though he doesn't have a child, develop an endearing chemistry.  Their characters seem to help each other mature past their irrational reservations.  She makes him soup and he makes her feel better about her unhealthy, late-teen relationship.There was ultimately nothing to the plot, but everything to the characters.  The writing was impressive, clever, funny, and tamely off-the-wall.

First is the improbability of a married couple of New Yorkers in which the the wife and the husband are respectively a vascular surgeon and an unsuccessful, rather immature writer of children's books whose companion from childhood is an imaginary superhero called Captain Excellent.  Surely, one must ask how many young ladies on the track to a successful surgical practice are going to have time for an overage adolescent who can't write a viable kids' book and who still converses with an imaginary friend?  That's problem one.  Problem two crops up when our improbable couple moves into a house at the seashore somewhere near NYC.

And especially when the next character on the scene is the Sagacious Teenager, who also finds this lummox worth her attention -- apparently because she finds it charming that he doesn't know enough to feed himself by boiling some vegetables.  But the Sagacious Teenager presents a plausibility problem of her own  I.e., why, as smart and attractive as she is, does her main squeeze turn out to be an ill-mannered slacker who has only the basest interest in her?  One might also question why our author friend chose not to rent a car for what turn out to be frequent trips to the nearby village and instead to laboriously peddle himself on a Schwinn Stingray bike found in the garage.  Could it be that the movie's producers decided that seeing a grown man huffing and puffing along on a kid's bike was a sure-fire laugh worth repeated viewings?

Hint: One character is wearing a costume to emphasize his symbolic position while the other is not, yet that does not change the characters symbolism. Sorry if that seems vague but I don't want to make it too obvious to those who have yet to see it but at the same time clarify that the so-called ""tragic ending"" is a misunderstanding rather than what actually happens in this intimate, probing, revealing, and ultimately healing character study.

His surgeon wife (Lisa Kudrow, as he calls her 'the doctor') takes him away to a small house in a little town to propel his writing and leaves him there.  He brings along an unusual side-kick which is his imaginary friend, 'Captain Excellent' (Ryan Reynolds - who will have you in stitches).  These two have been cohorts since grammar school, and Richard calls upon him in all types of situations. Or, he just may show up on his own?While dredging on with trying to write, Richard decides to take a bike ride to clear his head.  He pulls a child size bicycle from the garage and cruises quite oddly into town.  This is where we meet the amazing Emma Stone in her breakout performance as 'Abby'.  She's a loner, in need of a friend while Richard is of the same mind.  He decides to hire her as a babysitter for no apparent reason and she comes to his home that evening while he leaves.  She realizes that there is no baby present and goes along with this and all of Richard's various oddities that 'the doctor' never can understand.  They soon develop a lovely friendship based in loneliness at first, then find solace and comfort in talking with each other.  Spending time together and learning quickly how alike they truly are, they establish a rapid rapport.  Both are vastly misunderstood and extremely creative.Richard becomes so engrossed in Abby's life, a bit too much, and hastily decides to absentmindedly throw a high school party for Abby and various friends.  The scenes here are risque for some I would think; for some, not.  This would be up to your own judgment of an older man and a high school age girl. The two do end up talking all night and then falling asleep.  There are no lines crossed although some may find it pushing the limit as 'the doctor' does, as she brings a couple of friends to the home to discover Richard and Abby asleep together on the couch.  This is a very disturbing scene for a wife to walk into, Captain Excellent must once again save the day for Richard.  Anytime 'the Captain' shows up, it is sheer brilliance by Reynolds as his sarcastic comedy steals every scene he is in.  Buffed-up and dressed as the superhero he portrays, he delivers every time.This rarity of a film poses several intriguing questions: Who is this mysterious friend of Abby's?  How long will 'Captain Excellent' keep saving Richard from his problems?  Will Richard ever get to his novel?  And finally, will 'the doctor' ever accept her husband for who he is?The film richly blends together drama, comedy, tragedy, craziness, and a few tears which all lend to its heartfelt ending.",5,Parchment Gent,1332115200,"03 19, 2012",2012,2850,"['First-time', 'director', 'Kieran', 'Mulroney', 'together', 'intriguingly', 'thoughtful', 'character', 'study', 'lopsided', 'marriage', 'confused', 'friendship', 'great', 'view.Richard', 'Dunn', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'married', 'novelist', 'case', 'writer', 'block', 'surgeon', 'wife', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', ""'the"", 'doctor', 'away', 'small', 'house', 'little', 'town', 'propel', 'writing', 'there', 'unusual', 'side-kick', 'imaginary', 'friend', 'Excellent', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'who', 'will', 'have', 'stitches', 'two', 'have', 'been', 'cohorts', 'grammar', 'school', 'Richard', 'types', 'situations', 'just', 'may', 'show', 'up', 'own', 'dredging', 'trying', 'write', 'Richard', 'take', 'bike', 'ride', 'clear', 'head', 'child', 'size', 'bicycle', 'garage', 'quite', 'oddly', 'town', 'where', 'meet', 'amazing', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'breakout', 'performance', ""'Abby"", 'loner', 'need', 'friend', 'Richard', 'same', 'mind', 'hire', 'babysitter', 'apparent', 'reason', 'home', 'evening', 'baby', 'present', 'along', 'Richard', 'various', 'oddities', ""'the"", 'doctor', 'never', 'can', 'understand', 'soon', 'develop', 'lovely', 'friendship', 'based', 'loneliness', 'first', 'then', 'find', 'solace', 'comfort', 'talking', 'other', 'Spending', 'time', 'together', 'learning', 'quickly', 'how', 'truly', 'are', 'establish', 'rapid', 'rapport', 'are', 'vastly', 'misunderstood', 'extremely', 'creative.Richard', 'becomes', 'so', 'engrossed', 'Abby', 'life', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'hastily', 'decides', 'absentmindedly', 'throw', 'high', 'school', 'party', 'Abby', 'various', 'friends', 'scenes', 'here', 'are', 'risque', 'would', 'think', 'not', 'would', 'be', 'up', 'own', 'judgment', 'older', 'man', 'high', 'school', 'age', 'girl', 'two', 'do', 'end', 'up', 'talking', 'night', 'then', 'falling', 'asleep', 'are', 'lines', 'crossed', 'may', 'find', 'pushing', 'limit', ""'the"", 'doctor', 'couple', 'friends', 'home', 'discover', 'Richard', 'Abby', 'asleep', 'together', 'couch', 'very', 'disturbing', 'scene', 'wife', 'walk', 'Captain', 'Excellent', 'must', 'once', 'again', 'save', 'day', 'Richard', 'Anytime', 'Captain', 'up', 'sheer', 'brilliance', 'Reynolds', 'sarcastic', 'comedy', 'steals', 'scene', 'Buffed-up', 'dressed', 'superhero', 'time.This', 'rarity', 'film', 'several', 'intriguing', 'questions', 'Who', 'mysterious', 'friend', 'Abby', 'How', 'long', 'will', ""'Captain"", 'Excellent', 'keep', 'saving', 'Richard', 'problems', 'Will', 'Richard', 'ever', 'get', 'novel', 'finally', 'will', ""'the"", 'doctor', 'ever', 'husband', 'who', 'film', 'richly', 'together', 'drama', 'comedy', 'tragedy', 'craziness', 'few', 'tears', 'lend', 'heartfelt', 'ending']",N/A
