She shows you steps in doing her dance that you will learn at the end, and for helping you out in making a dance choreography of your own for your dance. I really love all of her dances on all 3 DVDS. I would really recommend them!",5,"Excellent, but maybe not for beginners",1166140800,"12 15, 2006",2006,534,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'bellydancing', 'while', 'finally', 'found', 'videos', 'introduced', 'new', 'moves', 'go', 'moves', 'little', 'fast', 'dvds', 'were', ""n't"", 'really', 'made', 'beginner', 'experience', 'moves', 'moves', 'are', 'shown', 'dance', 'choreography', 'steps', 'doing', 'dance', 'will', 'learn', 'end', 'helping', 'out', 'making', 'dance', 'choreography', 'own', 'dance', 'really', 'love', 'dances', '3', 'DVDS', 'would', 'really', 'recommend']",N/A

I enjoyed it very much, so I got the other two as well.In each one, Jillina offers some stretching exercises, then she has a segment on technique where you learn some moves individually. Following that there is a part on doing the steps, and she repeats the moves a couple times (at least); then you dance with her to the music. And she's not done yet. There is a section on choreography where you can go over the steps you just learned and practice those with a bit of variation.She tops it all off with a performance in a nightclub setting and it's fun to watch her dance. She's a riveting performer and makes it all look so effortless (and is even more amazing if you know how much work it is).I love that the instruction is done in front of a mirror, so you see her doing the moves from two angles, and she'll even go so far as to instruct you which foot to take a step with, so you can follow her that much more if you have two left feet.She starts slow and explains it thoroughly and then you build up on it. Some moves are easy to pick up and others take a bit more effort, but it's fun to rewind and actually have a chance to do some steps. The first volume is easiest to learn (naturally) and they climb in difficulty but it's not overwhelming (mind you, I'm no pro, just a living room dancer with a few lessons under her belt). I love how well these dvds are done, and how clear Jillina is. They're excellent, especially for people who want stuff that is a bit more challenging and who want to explore more choreography.",5,A superstar bellydance DVD,1110240000,"03 8, 2005",2005,1738,"['own', 'bunch', 'bellydance', 'workout/instruction', 'tapes', 'love', 'others', 'not', 'much.So', 'bought', 'volume', '2', 'just', 'heck', 'quite', 'simply', 'wanted', 'dance', 'tape', 'work', 'out', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'much', 'got', 'other', 'two', 'well.In', 'one', 'Jillina', 'stretching', 'exercises', 'then', 'segment', 'technique', 'where', 'learn', 'moves', 'individually', 'Following', 'part', 'doing', 'steps', 'moves', 'couple', 'times', 'least', 'then', 'dance', 'music', 'not', 'done', 'yet', 'section', 'choreography', 'where', 'can', 'go', 'steps', 'just', 'learned', 'practice', 'bit', 'variation.She', 'tops', 'off', 'performance', 'nightclub', 'setting', 'fun', 'watch', 'dance', 'riveting', 'performer', 'look', 'so', 'effortless', 'even', 'more', 'amazing', 'know', 'how', 'much', 'work', '.I', 'love', 'instruction', 'done', 'front', 'mirror', 'see', 'doing', 'moves', 'two', 'angles', ""'ll"", 'even', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'instruct', 'foot', 'take', 'step', 'can', 'follow', 'much', 'more', 'have', 'two', 'left', 'feet.She', 'slow', 'thoroughly', 'then', 'build', 'up', 'moves', 'are', 'easy', 'pick', 'up', 'others', 'take', 'bit', 'more', 'effort', 'fun', 'rewind', 'actually', 'have', 'chance', 'do', 'steps', 'first', 'volume', 'easiest', 'learn', 'naturally', 'climb', 'difficulty', 'not', 'overwhelming', ""'m"", 'pro', 'just', 'living', 'room', 'dancer', 'few', 'lessons', 'belt', 'love', 'how', 'well', 'dvds', 'are', 'done', 'how', 'clear', 'Jillina', ""'re"", 'excellent', 'especially', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'stuff', 'bit', 'more', 'challenging', 'who', 'want', 'explore', 'more', 'choreography']",N/A
776092,AMNX4BNJMESVM,B0000CEB69,Nikkiya,"[10, 14]","Jillina's ""instructional"" videos include some belly dance technique and combinations which she puts together into a performance at the end of each one. Overall, it seems more instructional in choreography than in belly dance technique, and Jillina filmed choreography that she uses elsewhere. Learning choreography technique and getting ideas from this video can be helpful, but learning music composition is fairly crucial to this process as well if that's what you're seeking. While Jillina can belly dance and put together choreography, the tone of her videos is directed at the American consumer, or it is, rather, commercialized. By her own admission, her background is in Jazz dance. I recommend that if you are looking for technique than the best thing to do is enroll in a class with a teacher you are comfortable with and if you use videos, use them to augment your lessons. Videos, as true in this set, will not teach you emotional interpretation of music and using expression like you'll see with authentic Egyptian performers (this is much more than remembering to smile while you dance).",3,Mixed feelings.,1093910400,"08 31, 2004",2004,1100,"['Jillina', 'instructional', 'videos', 'include', 'belly', 'dance', 'technique', 'combinations', 'together', 'performance', 'end', 'one', 'Overall', 'more', 'instructional', 'choreography', 'belly', 'dance', 'technique', 'Jillina', 'filmed', 'choreography', 'elsewhere', 'Learning', 'choreography', 'technique', 'getting', 'ideas', 'video', 'can', 'be', 'helpful', 'learning', 'music', 'composition', 'fairly', 'crucial', 'process', 'as', 'well', 'what', ""'re"", 'seeking', 'Jillina', 'can', 'belly', 'dance', 'put', 'together', 'choreography', 'tone', 'videos', 'directed', 'American', 'consumer', 'rather', 'commercialized', 'own', 'admission', 'background', 'Jazz', 'dance', 'recommend', 'are', 'looking', 'technique', 'best', 'thing', 'do', 'enroll', 'class', 'teacher', 'are', 'comfortable', 'use', 'videos', 'use', 'augment', 'lessons', 'Videos', 'true', 'set', 'will', 'not', 'teach', 'emotional', 'interpretation', 'music', 'using', 'expression', ""'ll"", 'see', 'authentic', 'Egyptian', 'performers', 'much', 'more', 'remembering', 'smile', 'dance']",N/A

She may not go into it in depth like if you were in a seminar but you do have the reverse button on your control so that you can see the moves over and over again.  Yes, she has a jazz and ballet background but she has performed in other countries and very sought after for weekend seminars which I was lucky to take one and just love her for her easy way and explainations of the moves.  You should have a live teacher to correct any movements you may be doing incorrectly.  However, I think her video series are an excellent tool for those that can't get to a studio or don't have a teacher near by. I am still a student but I think she has one of better instructional videos out there and affordable without being a cheap useless DVD that will sit on my shelf.

She is a GREAT teacher.  She makes it so simple and really gives you good moves and combinations you can rearrange and use again and again.  She also shows you the combinations to a variety of music so you can begin to learn how to apply them to anything you hear and dance to more than just the routine song at the end.You will stretch, learn technique, then 8-10 combinations, followed by complete choreography to a specific song.There are also drum solo and veil dances included on each dvd- performances you will have fun trying (without any instruction).I really love these routines- they are a lot of fun.",5,If you want to learn to bellyDANCE- you want these dvds!,1144454400,"04 8, 2006",2006,760,"['dvds', 'teach', 'three', 'very', 'impressive', 'routines', 'even', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'workout-', 'will', 'be', 'sweating', 'end', 'GREAT', 'teacher', 'so', 'simple', 'really', 'good', 'moves', 'combinations', 'can', 'rearrange', 'use', 'again', 'again', 'also', 'combinations', 'variety', 'music', 'can', 'begin', 'learn', 'how', 'apply', 'anything', 'hear', 'dance', 'more', 'just', 'routine', 'song', 'end.You', 'will', 'stretch', 'learn', 'technique', 'then', '8-10', 'combinations', 'followed', 'complete', 'choreography', 'specific', 'are', 'also', 'drum', 'solo', 'veil', 'dances', 'included', 'dvd-', 'performances', 'will', 'have', 'fun', 'trying', 'instruction', 'really', 'love', 'routines-', 'are', 'lot', 'fun']",N/A
