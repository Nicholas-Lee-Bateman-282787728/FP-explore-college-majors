929038,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000AMWIUI,Grady Harp,"[12, 13]","Argentina's Dirty War and the regime of the Generals from 1976 to 1983 is one of the dark secrets of history and has been examined by poets, writers such as Colm Toibin (and here, Lawrence Thornton in his novel from which the film was adapted), and journalists.  And yet the silence about this period of time is deafening, especially since the amnesty this past June releasing the perpetrators from all responsibility of this terrifying activity and time in Argentina.  Now, with the current 'silencing' of our own covert CIA activities and tortures in the name of a fight against terrorism, this overlooked film takes on particular potency.  And for whatever reasons the film doesn't succeed as a great movie, at least it is a red flag bravely waving.In 1976 the intellects, professors, journalists and writers  began disappearing, kidnapped, taken to secret hideaways, tortured, raped, and disposed of all in the guise of protecting the viability of the military regime.  Carlos (Antonio Banderas) runs a children's theater and is married to Cecilia (Emma Thompson) who writes articles about the ""desaparecidos"" despite the warnings from Carlos and their close friends Silvio (Rub&eacute;n Blades) and Esme (Maria Canals).  Their daughter Teresa (Leticia Dolera) is a young girl who is conflicted about the feelings of her parents in this scandalized government.  Cecilia is abducted, becomes one of the dreaded desaparecidos, and Carlos commits himself to finding her.  He discovers he has clairvoyant powers and holds meetings in his garden to help parents and loved ones of the  desaparecidos to cope.  Working with Teresa he tries to envision Cecilia's whereabouts and the film's d&eacute;nouement  and conclusion deal with this breathless seeking.The acting if good as expected from this cast. The direction is fast paced, but the problem is one of distance from the passion of Carlos.  For some reason Banderas elected to keep such a low profiles that his desperation to find Cecilia is somewhat muted.  But as stated above the real success of this fine little film is the message it carries and that message is too close to home to ignore.  The musical score and cinematography (and the incidental wonderful Tango dancing) are superb.  Recommended.

929039,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B000AMWIUI,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 0]","This is a very serious film on the military dictatorship in Argentina at the end of the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s. Some 30,000 people disappeared and never came back, many of them not even as bones or ashes.It is a total reconstruction of the atmosphere of that period in the mind of a playwright and actor who had the phenomenal capability of being a psychic seer. The film merges many different layers. First some real events and the real atmosphere of a country that does not have any rule of law any more: fear, panic even, and the consequence of it, isolation, silence, thought retention, not to speak of spies and secret agents of the dictatorship.Then some imaginary representations of what happened to those who had been captured as brought to us through the psychic visions of the playwright. He finds some symbols in the world around him in birds and he gets this fascination with birds from some Auschwitz survivors who tell us how birds where attracted into the camp and how the Nazis just destroyed them with a flame thrower or something that burned them alive, a sort of cruel metaphor of the million bodies that were burned in the cremating furnaces of the camp, though this time those human bodies had been killed in a way or another before being pushed into the flames.But the film also adds systematic visions of demonstrators who are just requiring in front of the presidential palace to get news about their vanished parents and relatives. That is some poignant testimony that the Nazi parallel is excessive and that these generals and other military officers and paramilitary personnel is excessive. The Nazi swastikas have nothing to do there. That harms the discourse. Dictatorship is always possible, any time history wants, even in the best democracy, in the form of the rule of a minority imposed in a way or another to the majority of the people, even if and when this majority votes for the dictatorial minority. Voting is no guarantee for democracy. The only guarantee is check and balance on one hand and limited terms on the other hand.Further on the film is explicit about torturing, dropping people into the ocean, raping women and executing people and that explicit representing of shocking elements gives to the film a nauseating dimension. The film itself is not nauseating, but it represents a nauseating reality that still exists and is practised even in our supposedly civilized countries or by representatives, military or other, from our supposedly civilized countries like in Iraq, Afghanistan and Guantanamo.Finally the film also shows some pure pieces of joy and happiness when the dictatorship is finally finished, though it does not explain how it came to an end, and they even manage to give a streak of happy ending in that particularly bleak reality.But keep in mind that can happen any time in the next door house, or the apartment over or under yours, or in the street behind the school or in front of the cathedral. The rule of law is nothing sacred really and if it is then there are many iconoclastic barbarians all around us. But keep that film for people over 14 if possible.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,It could happen in our backyard any time,1341619200,"07 7, 2012",2012,3163,"['very', 'serious', 'film', 'military', 'dictatorship', 'Argentina', 'end', '1970s', 'beginning', '1980s', '30,000', 'people', 'disappeared', 'never', 'came', 'back', 'many', 'not', 'even', 'bones', 'ashes.It', 'total', 'reconstruction', 'atmosphere', 'period', 'mind', 'playwright', 'actor', 'who', 'had', 'phenomenal', 'capability', 'being', 'psychic', 'seer', 'film', 'many', 'different', 'layers', 'First', 'real', 'events', 'real', 'atmosphere', 'country', 'not', 'have', 'rule', 'law', 'more', 'fear', 'panic', 'even', 'consequence', 'isolation', 'silence', 'thought', 'retention', 'not', 'speak', 'spies', 'secret', 'agents', 'dictatorship.Then', 'imaginary', 'representations', 'what', 'happened', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'captured', 'brought', 'psychic', 'visions', 'playwright', 'symbols', 'world', 'birds', 'fascination', 'birds', 'Auschwitz', 'survivors', 'who', 'tell', 'how', 'birds', 'where', 'attracted', 'camp', 'how', 'Nazis', 'just', 'destroyed', 'flame', 'thrower', 'something', 'burned', 'alive', 'sort', 'cruel', 'metaphor', 'million', 'bodies', 'were', 'burned', 'cremating', 'furnaces', 'camp', 'time', 'human', 'bodies', 'had', 'been', 'killed', 'way', 'being', 'pushed', 'flames.But', 'film', 'also', 'systematic', 'visions', 'demonstrators', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'requiring', 'front', 'presidential', 'palace', 'get', 'news', 'vanished', 'parents', 'relatives', 'poignant', 'testimony', 'Nazi', 'parallel', 'excessive', 'generals', 'other', 'military', 'officers', 'paramilitary', 'personnel', 'excessive', 'Nazi', 'swastikas', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'there', 'discourse', 'Dictatorship', 'always', 'possible', 'time', 'history', 'even', 'best', 'democracy', 'form', 'rule', 'minority', 'imposed', 'way', 'majority', 'people', 'even', 'when', 'majority', 'dictatorial', 'minority', 'Voting', 'guarantee', 'democracy', 'only', 'guarantee', 'check', 'balance', 'one', 'hand', 'limited', 'terms', 'other', 'hand.Further', 'film', 'explicit', 'torturing', 'dropping', 'people', 'ocean', 'raping', 'women', 'executing', 'people', 'explicit', 'representing', 'shocking', 'elements', 'film', 'nauseating', 'dimension', 'film', 'not', 'nauseating', 'nauseating', 'reality', 'still', 'practised', 'even', 'supposedly', 'civilized', 'countries', 'representatives', 'military', 'other', 'supposedly', 'civilized', 'countries', 'Iraq', 'Afghanistan', 'Guantanamo.Finally', 'film', 'also', 'pure', 'pieces', 'joy', 'happiness', 'when', 'dictatorship', 'finally', 'finished', 'not', 'explain', 'how', 'came', 'end', 'even', 'manage', 'give', 'streak', 'happy', 'ending', 'particularly', 'bleak', 'reality.But', 'keep', 'mind', 'can', 'happen', 'time', 'next', 'door', 'house', 'apartment', 'yours', 'street', 'school', 'front', 'cathedral', 'rule', 'law', 'nothing', 'sacred', 'really', 'then', 'are', 'many', 'iconoclastic', 'barbarians', 'keep', 'film', 'people', '14', 'possible.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",N/A

929041,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B000AMWIUI,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[31, 33]","Imagining Argentina applies the word disappear in a factual manner, the way it was used by the military government between 1976 and 1983.  The word disappear, opposite of appear, has a direct link with what is removed out of sight and no longer can be noticed.  Disappear in this film refers to the disappearance of several thousand people during the juntas control of Argentina, which they blamed on extremists and terrorists while denying all involvement themselves.  Nonetheless, the disappearances begun shortly after the military had gained control in 1976.A brief historical background can help the audience get a grasp of the situation in Imagining Argentina, which takes place during the junta's control.  After the military coup in 1976 when Mar&iacute;a Per&oacute;n was tossed out of office, the military government began to keep track of those who opposed them.  It led to eight petrifying years, as the megalomaniac military leader Videla and his allies pursued all opposition through state funded terrorism, which often meant rape and murder.  Many of those who opposed the government ended up in concentration camps where the ""disappeared"" people faced gruesome torture and other inhuman acts of violence.  Imagining Argentina takes place amidst these dark years of the military governments intimidating steel grip of the Argentinean population through frequently disappearing individuals.The film opens on a theater stage where Orpheus' wife disappears forever after having acted on an instantaneous impulse to look back at her.  Symbolically, the scene with Orpheus prompts the audience to ponder the ambiguous concept of looking back, which suggests several different ideas such as the pain of the past, the healing power of remembrance, and the wisdom of memories.  The film deals with several of these concepts throughout the film, as it follows the theater director Carlos Rueda (Antonio Banderas) after his wife and journalist, Cecilia (Emma Thompson), ""disappears"".  Through another disappearance of one of his young actors' father, Carlos recognizes that he has a unique gift that helps him see the ""disappeared"" and their fate.  Carlos is clairvoyant.Initially, clairvoyance seems a little insensitive in regards to the tragedy of the not so distant past.  However, the clairvoyance provides an interesting angle on the historical dark period of Argentina, as the military government later sought to forget the time of the disappearances.  It also offers the characters a view into the junta's secretive kidnappings and hideous crimes to which the government denied any involvement.  Even the Amnesty International and other countries questioned the disappearances, but without any result until after 1983.  It was after 1983, the junta was trying to brush it under the carpet, but remembrance would help the people keep their memories of the disappeared alive while the remembering continues to help prevent similar events from happening again.  Thus, looking beyond the discomfort of knowing the fate of Carlos' family, and understand the symbolical meaning of clairvoyance the film presents an important film that reveals that the events of the Nazi concentration camps repeated itself in history some 30 years later.Alicia Partnov (who is not a character in the film, but a real person) was one of those who ""disappeared"", and she tells her story in the biographical novel The Little School.  Another person is the human rights activist Adolfo P&eacute;rez Esquivel (another real person) who received the Nobel peace prize for his humanitarian efforts and spending 14 months in one of these concentration camps.  It is through creative works such as Imagining Argentina that these survivors can spread the words of the horrors and crimes committed in the world.  The theater within the film also provides the notion that fantasy and imagination present an opportunity to help prevent such awful terror, as it pleads through its emotional and contextual content for the audience to understand the pain and agony of those who disappeared.  The performance by the whole cast is very good while Emma Thompson elevates the cinematic experience in one scene where she screams without uttering a single sound.  The scene is tragically disturbing while the pain and agony of Cecilia is very real, and this performance is another reason why creativity can help teach valuable lessons about our past that we should not forget.Thus, at the end of 1983, the Argentinean junta had applied the term ""disappear"" to some 30,000 people, which left the Argentinean people with a deep national scar that should not be forgotten.",4,Artistically Emotional Drama of the Terrifying Argentinean Disappearances...,1131753600,"11 12, 2005",2005,4638,"['Imagining', 'Argentina', 'word', 'disappear', 'factual', 'manner', 'way', 'was', 'used', 'military', 'government', '1976', '1983', 'word', 'disappear', 'opposite', 'appear', 'direct', 'link', 'what', 'removed', 'sight', 'longer', 'can', 'be', 'noticed', 'Disappear', 'film', 'refers', 'disappearance', 'several', 'thousand', 'people', 'juntas', 'control', 'Argentina', 'blamed', 'extremists', 'terrorists', 'denying', 'involvement', 'Nonetheless', 'disappearances', 'begun', 'shortly', 'military', 'had', 'gained', 'control', '1976.A', 'brief', 'historical', 'background', 'can', 'help', 'audience', 'get', 'grasp', 'situation', 'Imagining', 'Argentina', 'place', 'junta', 'control', 'military', 'coup', '1976', 'when', 'Mar', 'iacute', 'Per', 'oacute', 'was', 'tossed', 'office', 'military', 'government', 'began', 'keep', 'track', 'who', 'opposed', 'led', 'eight', 'petrifying', 'years', 'megalomaniac', 'military', 'leader', 'Videla', 'allies', 'pursued', 'opposition', 'state', 'funded', 'terrorism', 'often', 'meant', 'rape', 'murder', 'Many', 'who', 'opposed', 'government', 'ended', 'up', 'concentration', 'camps', 'where', 'disappeared', 'people', 'faced', 'gruesome', 'torture', 'other', 'inhuman', 'acts', 'violence', 'Imagining', 'Argentina', 'place', 'dark', 'years', 'military', 'governments', 'intimidating', 'steel', 'grip', 'Argentinean', 'population', 'frequently', 'disappearing', 'individuals.The', 'film', 'theater', 'stage', 'where', 'Orpheus', 'wife', 'disappears', 'forever', 'having', 'acted', 'instantaneous', 'impulse', 'look', 'back', 'Symbolically', 'scene', 'Orpheus', 'prompts', 'audience', 'ponder', 'ambiguous', 'concept', 'looking', 'back', 'several', 'different', 'ideas', 'such', 'pain', 'past', 'healing', 'power', 'remembrance', 'wisdom', 'memories', 'film', 'deals', 'several', 'concepts', 'film', 'theater', 'director', 'Carlos', 'Rueda', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'wife', 'journalist', 'Cecilia', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'disappears', 'disappearance', 'one', 'young', 'actors', 'father', 'Carlos', 'unique', 'gift', 'see', 'disappeared', 'fate', 'Carlos', 'clairvoyant.Initially', 'clairvoyance', 'little', 'insensitive', 'regards', 'tragedy', 'not', 'so', 'distant', 'past', 'However', 'clairvoyance', 'interesting', 'angle', 'historical', 'dark', 'period', 'Argentina', 'military', 'government', 'later', 'sought', 'forget', 'time', 'disappearances', 'also', 'characters', 'view', 'junta', 'secretive', 'kidnappings', 'hideous', 'crimes', 'government', 'denied', 'involvement', 'Even', 'Amnesty', 'International', 'other', 'countries', 'questioned', 'disappearances', 'result', '1983', 'was', '1983', 'junta', 'was', 'trying', 'brush', 'carpet', 'remembrance', 'would', 'help', 'people', 'keep', 'memories', 'disappeared', 'alive', 'remembering', 'help', 'prevent', 'similar', 'events', 'happening', 'again', 'Thus', 'looking', 'discomfort', 'knowing', 'fate', 'Carlos', 'family', 'understand', 'symbolical', 'meaning', 'clairvoyance', 'film', 'important', 'film', 'events', 'Nazi', 'concentration', 'camps', 'repeated', 'history', '30', 'years', 'later.Alicia', 'Partnov', 'who', 'not', 'character', 'film', 'real', 'person', 'was', 'one', 'who', 'disappeared', 'story', 'biographical', 'novel', 'Little', 'School', 'person', 'human', 'rights', 'activist', 'Adolfo', 'P', 'eacute', 'Esquivel', 'real', 'person', 'who', 'received', 'Nobel', 'peace', 'prize', 'humanitarian', 'efforts', 'spending', '14', 'months', 'one', 'concentration', 'camps', 'creative', 'works', 'such', 'Imagining', 'Argentina', 'survivors', 'can', 'spread', 'words', 'horrors', 'crimes', 'committed', 'world', 'theater', 'film', 'also', 'notion', 'fantasy', 'imagination', 'present', 'opportunity', 'help', 'prevent', 'such', 'awful', 'terror', 'emotional', 'contextual', 'content', 'audience', 'understand', 'pain', 'agony', 'who', 'disappeared', 'performance', 'whole', 'cast', 'very', 'good', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'screams', 'uttering', 'single', 'sound', 'scene', 'tragically', 'disturbing', 'pain', 'agony', 'Cecilia', 'very', 'real', 'performance', 'reason', 'why', 'creativity', 'can', 'help', 'teach', 'valuable', 'lessons', 'past', 'should', 'not', 'forget.Thus', 'end', '1983', 'Argentinean', 'junta', 'had', 'applied', 'term', 'disappear', '30,000', 'people', 'left', 'Argentinean', 'people', 'deep', 'national', 'scar', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'forgotten']",N/A

Nothing is spared as the viewer relives this horrific era in Argentinian history.

A part of this movie's beauty- it feels real, like one is there with them. I really felt I was there with these people, and Carlos relationship with his daughter, wife, and friends  were well portrayed. No one was doing the typical phony overemoting hysterics, which drowns out real emotion, (which was very evident). Banderas was very convincing with just his eyes, and his soft spoken ways. People in the movie make some bad decisions, there is confusion, and one can feel them floundering to find a way to fight back.  I thought to myself, geez, I would be fleeing the country! Yet, history shows people do not generally flee, but, endure.

I admit I am not altogether familiar with the history behind this story but this film, under the assumption that it is portrayed somewhat correctly, gave me a fairly good idea of what happened. However, it is not entirely heavy on the political realm for much symbolism is used throughout. Indeed, the political backstory is almost put on the back-burner in favor of the more dramatically-pleasing plot of finding missing family members.Antonio Banderas proves that he can actually act and gives a fine performance (if at time slightly cheesy). Emma Thompson is, as always, brilliant in a surprising South American accent which she does very well. The film is emotionally charged throughout, especially the last shot. It's a good thing the writers didn't opt for a happy-everyone-returns-safely-ending (cough*War of the Worlds*cough).I can't think why this movie was so badly received at the Venice Film Festival where it was first premiered. The plot moves slowly at times (are all those 'garden' scenes really necessary?) but otherwise I found the plot quite tightly-knit with the appropriate symbols reappearing in the correct places. The major asset to the film, however, is the performances of the two lead actors. The supporting cast is slightly weak, though passable.All in all, a recommended film, especially if you are a fan of either Banderas or Thompson.note: The DVD is woefully bereft of extras.",4,Symbolical political drama,1142294400,"03 14, 2006",2006,1624,"['Mix', 'one', 'part', 'magical', 'realism', 'two', 'parts', 'government', 'corruption', 'heavy', 'dose', 'good', 'acting', ""'ve"", 'basically', 'got', 'idea', 'unflinching', 'portrayal', 'Videl', 'dictatorship', 'Argentina', '1970s', 'admit', 'am', 'not', 'altogether', 'familiar', 'history', 'story', 'film', 'assumption', 'portrayed', 'somewhat', 'correctly', 'gave', 'fairly', 'good', 'idea', 'what', 'happened', 'However', 'not', 'entirely', 'heavy', 'political', 'realm', 'much', 'symbolism', 'used', 'Indeed', 'political', 'backstory', 'almost', 'put', 'back-burner', 'favor', 'more', 'dramatically-pleasing', 'plot', 'finding', 'missing', 'family', 'members.Antonio', 'Banderas', 'can', 'actually', 'act', 'fine', 'performance', 'time', 'slightly', 'cheesy', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'always', 'brilliant', 'surprising', 'South', 'American', 'accent', 'very', 'well', 'film', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'especially', 'last', 'shot', 'good', 'thing', 'writers', 'did', ""n't"", 'opt', 'happy-everyone-returns-safely-ending', 'cough*War', 'Worlds*cough', '.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'why', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'badly', 'received', 'Venice', 'Film', 'Festival', 'where', 'was', 'first', 'premiered', 'plot', 'slowly', 'times', 'are', ""'garden"", 'scenes', 'really', 'necessary', 'otherwise', 'found', 'plot', 'quite', 'tightly-knit', 'appropriate', 'symbols', 'reappearing', 'correct', 'places', 'major', 'asset', 'film', 'however', 'performances', 'two', 'lead', 'actors', 'supporting', 'cast', 'slightly', 'weak', 'passable.All', 'recommended', 'film', 'especially', 'are', 'fan', 'Banderas', 'Thompson.note', 'DVD', 'woefully', 'bereft', 'extras']",N/A

I agree with the other review that criticizes the film for trivializing the sad horrors of South America by playing them out in a movie about a psychic.  The 1982 film MISSING with Jack Lemmon and DEATH & THE MAIDEN with Sigourney Weaver touch on the same topic and do a better job of handling it.You almost feel guilty for watching a form of entertainment about a dark and despicable part of history.Watching IMAGINING ARGENTINA is kind of like watching THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION if that film had included numerous brutal prison gang rapes.,2,If Stephen King had been born in South America....,1160611200,"10 12, 2006",2006,685,"['really', 'feel', 'hesitant', 'giving', 'movie', 'poor', 'review', 'very', 'well-made', 'everyone', 'excellent', ""n't"", 'work', 'agree', 'other', 'review', 'film', 'trivializing', 'sad', 'horrors', 'South', 'America', 'playing', 'out', 'movie', 'psychic', '1982', 'film', 'MISSING', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'DEATH', 'THE', 'MAIDEN', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'touch', 'same', 'topic', 'do', 'better', 'job', 'handling', 'it.You', 'almost', 'feel', 'guilty', 'watching', 'form', 'entertainment', 'dark', 'despicable', 'part', 'history.Watching', 'IMAGINING', 'ARGENTINA', 'kind', 'watching', 'THE', 'SHAWSHANK', 'REDEMPTION', 'film', 'had', 'included', 'numerous', 'brutal', 'prison', 'gang', 'rapes']",N/A
929049,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000AMWIUI,Tsuyoshi,"[7, 13]","Christopher Hampton adapted and directed Lawrence Thornton's novel of the same title, and the film stars Antonio Banderas and Emma Thompson. The theme of the film is very serious, for it deals with the historical fact in Argentina during the late 70s and early 80s, the time of dictatorship when, as the film says, as many as 30,000 people disappeared without trace.The film starts with such a `disappearance of one journalist in Argentina. Cecilia (Emma Thompson) is suddenly taken away, and her husband and stage director for kids Carlos cannot find a single trace of her. Around him, many similar cases had happened, but Carlos never dreamed that it could happen to Cecilia.However ... now, here is the point that divides the opinions, but we are told that Carlos has a certain kind of gift - clairvoyance. He is surprised to find (as much as we would do) that he can see things. Tell Carlos the name and the place of the ones who have vanished, and he can 'see' what happened to them. In fact, he can sometimes tell you what will happen to them, and while Carlos searches his missing wife, his strange psychic-like ability starts to attract people as well as the government.[MAGIC REALISM?] Perhaps Antonio Banderas himself would explain, if asked about Carlos's unique ability, that it is based on the idea often associated with South American literature, the tradition of magic realism. I know the idea, and that works on paper (and in books), but when I see the acting of Banderas in thick beard grimacing at table, I just don't buy the idea simply because his acting is too bad to sustain the heavy weight of the truths about the victims of the brutal violence done by the dictators. And tell me, please, if he can predict the future events, why didn't he think of hiding his own daughter, most sensible thing that even I can think of without supernatural power.Emma Thompson is much better, but when Christopher Hampton mixes many things with the serious social issue so carelessly that `Imagining Argentina' defeats its purpose in the end. There is a message Carlos proudly says -- that is, no violence can kill the imagination of people, but the film's graphic torture scenes suggest otherwise. The symbolism about birds, or the spiritual `guidance' by an owl, could be interesting if the film had presented them with more sophisticated hand. Christopher Hampton (who adapted `Dangerous Liaisons' for screen in 1988) is a good writer but not a great director, and his heavy-handed direction only leaves us bemused when Banderas' Carlos is literally (yes, literally) led by the birds to the place where he should go.And this is about the worst period of this country, which many people must still vividly remember. I do not disagree with the film's violence, which I believe is tamed for the general audiences. I am not against the use of supernatural concept as long as it shows the pains of the people who suffered. But `Imagining Argentina' does them so clumsily and heavy-handedly, with unnecessary flashbacks (about the happy lovers by the seaside, for example); the Great-Escape-like action that has no meaning, and these plot devices all look merely weak and cumbersome before the cruel and shocking historical fact. I admit the film's intention is laudable, but clairvoyance is not the way to tell this story, not the right way to confront the hard reality.",2,Disappearance in Argentina: Unnesesarry Plot Devices Spoil the Impact of the Historical Truths,1135296000,"12 23, 2005",2005,3375,"['Christopher', 'Hampton', 'adapted', 'directed', 'Lawrence', 'Thornton', 'novel', 'same', 'title', 'film', 'stars', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'theme', 'film', 'very', 'serious', 'historical', 'fact', 'Argentina', 'late', '70s', 'early', '80s', 'time', 'dictatorship', 'when', 'film', 'as', 'many', '30,000', 'people', 'disappeared', 'trace.The', 'film', 'disappearance', 'one', 'journalist', 'Argentina', 'Cecilia', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'suddenly', 'taken', 'away', 'husband', 'stage', 'director', 'kids', 'Carlos', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'single', 'trace', 'many', 'similar', 'cases', 'had', 'happened', 'Carlos', 'never', 'dreamed', 'could', 'happen', 'Cecilia.However', 'now', 'here', 'point', 'opinions', 'are', 'told', 'Carlos', 'certain', 'kind', 'gift', 'clairvoyance', 'surprised', 'find', 'as', 'much', 'would', 'do', 'can', 'see', 'things', 'Tell', 'Carlos', 'name', 'place', 'ones', 'who', 'have', 'vanished', 'can', ""'see"", 'what', 'happened', 'fact', 'can', 'sometimes', 'tell', 'will', 'happen', 'Carlos', 'missing', 'wife', 'strange', 'psychic-like', 'ability', 'attract', 'people', 'as', 'well', 'government', '[', 'MAGIC', 'REALISM', ']', 'Perhaps', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'would', 'explain', 'asked', 'Carlos', 'unique', 'ability', 'based', 'idea', 'often', 'associated', 'South', 'American', 'literature', 'tradition', 'magic', 'realism', 'know', 'idea', 'paper', 'books', 'when', 'see', 'acting', 'Banderas', 'thick', 'beard', 'grimacing', 'table', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'idea', 'simply', 'acting', 'too', 'bad', 'sustain', 'heavy', 'weight', 'truths', 'victims', 'brutal', 'violence', 'done', 'dictators', 'tell', 'please', 'can', 'predict', 'future', 'events', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'hiding', 'own', 'daughter', 'most', 'sensible', 'thing', 'even', 'can', 'think', 'supernatural', 'power.Emma', 'Thompson', 'much', 'better', 'when', 'Christopher', 'Hampton', 'mixes', 'many', 'things', 'serious', 'social', 'issue', 'so', 'carelessly', 'Imagining', 'Argentina', 'defeats', 'purpose', 'end', 'message', 'Carlos', 'proudly', 'violence', 'can', 'kill', 'imagination', 'people', 'film', 'graphic', 'torture', 'scenes', 'suggest', 'otherwise', 'symbolism', 'birds', 'spiritual', 'guidance', 'owl', 'could', 'be', 'interesting', 'film', 'had', 'presented', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'hand', 'Christopher', 'Hampton', 'who', 'adapted', 'Dangerous', 'Liaisons', 'screen', '1988', 'good', 'writer', 'not', 'great', 'director', 'heavy-handed', 'direction', 'only', 'bemused', 'when', 'Banderas', 'Carlos', 'literally', 'yes', 'literally', 'led', 'birds', 'place', 'where', 'should', 'go.And', 'worst', 'period', 'country', 'many', 'people', 'must', 'still', 'vividly', 'remember', 'do', 'not', 'disagree', 'film', 'violence', 'believe', 'tamed', 'general', 'audiences', 'am', 'not', 'use', 'supernatural', 'concept', 'as', 'long', 'pains', 'people', 'who', 'suffered', 'Imagining', 'Argentina', 'so', 'clumsily', 'heavy-handedly', 'unnecessary', 'flashbacks', 'happy', 'lovers', 'seaside', 'example', 'Great-Escape-like', 'action', 'meaning', 'plot', 'devices', 'look', 'merely', 'weak', 'cumbersome', 'cruel', 'shocking', 'historical', 'fact', 'admit', 'film', 'intention', 'laudable', 'clairvoyance', 'not', 'way', 'tell', 'story', 'not', 'right', 'way', 'confront', 'hard', 'reality']",N/A
