931383,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,B000AQKZK4,Bobby Underwood,"[27, 28]","It is a shame this film has fallen into obscurity over the years. Though overshadowed by Elia Kazan's more heralded and flashier efforts, I have always found ""A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"" and ""Wild River"" to be his best. Thanks to a scarred Montgomery Clift and a young and earthy Lee Remick, ""Wild River"" has a feeling of quiet reality.Monty's genius was to be so much the person he was portraying that he seemed to disappear onscreen. Clift's sensitive performance here, coming after the accident which altered his appearance, is one of his best. It is matched by lovely Lee Remick.Clift works for the TVA (Tennessee Valley Authority) and has come to Jo Van Fleet's rural home to move her off her land so room can be made for a dam. Clift is not uncaring and his sympathy for the older woman is complicated even further by his attraction to her young granddaughter, Lee Remick.He is also unpopular because of his fair treatment of blacks whom he is employing to help build the dam. But the violence simmering just beneath the surface here is less on his mind than Remick. He cannot have her because of what he is forced to do. Yet it is torture for him.Clift's sensitivity and Remick's heart, torn between what she knows he has to do and what she feels within for him creates a frustration for the would-be couple the viewer can really feel. One scene in particular, as Remick paces back and forth in front of a sitting Clift, reveals the ache in Clift which finally blows.Beautiful location filming by Kazan adds a further sense of reality to this quiet yet moving film. This was one of Clift's best post-accident performances and it is sad it is only available in this region 2 format for those across the pond to enjoy. Perhaps soon it will be recognized for the quiet masterpiece it is and become available to all.",5,A Forgotten Film,1171065600,"02 10, 2007",2007,1817,"['shame', 'film', 'fallen', 'obscurity', 'years', 'overshadowed', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'more', 'heralded', 'flashier', 'efforts', 'have', 'always', 'found', 'Tree', 'Grows', 'Brooklyn', 'Wild', 'River', 'be', 'best', 'Thanks', 'scarred', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'young', 'earthy', 'Lee', 'Remick', 'Wild', 'River', 'feeling', 'quiet', 'reality.Monty', 'genius', 'was', 'be', 'so', 'much', 'person', 'was', 'portraying', 'seemed', 'disappear', 'onscreen', 'Clift', 'sensitive', 'performance', 'here', 'coming', 'accident', 'altered', 'appearance', 'one', 'best', 'matched', 'lovely', 'Lee', 'Remick.Clift', 'TVA', 'Tennessee', 'Valley', 'Authority', 'come', 'Jo', 'Van', 'Fleet', 'rural', 'home', 'move', 'land', 'room', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'dam', 'Clift', 'not', 'uncaring', 'sympathy', 'older', 'woman', 'complicated', 'even', 'further', 'attraction', 'young', 'granddaughter', 'Lee', 'Remick.He', 'also', 'unpopular', 'fair', 'treatment', 'blacks', 'whom', 'employing', 'help', 'build', 'dam', 'violence', 'simmering', 'just', 'surface', 'here', 'less', 'mind', 'Remick', 'can', 'not', 'have', 'what', 'forced', 'do', 'Yet', 'torture', 'him.Clift', 'sensitivity', 'Remick', 'heart', 'torn', 'what', 'do', 'what', 'feels', 'frustration', 'would-be', 'couple', 'viewer', 'can', 'really', 'feel', 'One', 'scene', 'particular', 'Remick', 'back', 'forth', 'front', 'sitting', 'Clift', 'ache', 'Clift', 'finally', 'blows.Beautiful', 'location', 'filming', 'Kazan', 'further', 'sense', 'reality', 'quiet', 'yet', 'moving', 'film', 'was', 'one', 'Clift', 'best', 'post-accident', 'performances', 'sad', 'only', 'available', 'region', '2', 'format', 'pond', 'enjoy', 'Perhaps', 'soon', 'will', 'be', 'recognized', 'quiet', 'masterpiece', 'become', 'available']",N/A

931385,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,B000AQKZK4,Gregor von Kallahann,"[3, 3]","WILD RIVER may not have been a huge hit in its day, but given that it was directed by Elian Kazan, and had a noteworthy cast (with stars Montgomery Clift, Lee Remick and Jo Van Fleet all receiving critical acclaim if few award nominations), it would seem to be a prime candidate for a de luxe DVD release.  Ironically, it's yet to receive any US DVD release at all. Very strange indeed.  Here's a movie selected for preservation by the Library of Congress (2002) but is only available in NON-USA format as a DVD.Well, perhaps there'll come a day when the situation will be remedied, and reviews like mine will be but dated commentary.  Can't come soon enough in my book.And speaking of books, I remember snoozing through the lessons in my high school history classes and barely skimming the textbook on the history of the Tennessee Valley Authority and the bringing of electricity to the rurual South.  I mean, it was then 1968 and electricity everywhere was a given, wasn't it?  Who cared about such ancient history, why that was thirty some odd years before.Well, FORTY plus years on, I realize how important a good understanding of history really is--and how brief a time span thirty, forty or FIFTY years really is in the course of human history.  And I've come to realize how dramatic and literary treatments of historical events, stressing as they do the human element, really makes them come alive.  Why if my 16 year old self had been exposed to a screening of WILD RIVER, it just may have helped me connect with that particular chapter of US history a lot more readily. (The fact that Lee Remick was a teenage crush of mine certainly would have helped).WILD RIVER's storyline seems chock full of readymades (if not actual cliches): there's a feisty old widow whose refusal to sell her island home is holding up progress on the TVA's efforts to develop the Valley economically and to put an end to its cycle of endless flooding.  There's also a somewhat heavy handed treatment of racial issues, with the enlightened Northerner (Clift) doing his bit to bring some justice for the community's black population--and endangering himself and his new love (Remick) in the process.  None of this is especially surprising or dramatically overwhelming.  But it does provide a framework for some very honest scenes--mainly between Clift and Remick--in which conflicting emotions are expressed in refreshingly honest ways.Getting at the truths of the human heart was director Elia Kazan's true forte.  Yes, the history lesson is a valuable one, but what makes this film so compelling is the human element. The legitimacy of Kazan's reputation for being an actor's director was never better exemplified than in WILD RIVER.  Only Jo Van Fleet is permitted to chew the (truly breathtaking) scenery--as would seem to be her (and her character's) right.  Remick and Clift turn in more nuanced and tentative performances, in keeping with the tentativeness of their situation.  No false notes are hit in their scenes together--or with other actors.  A lesser film might have had Remick's jealous hometown beau (Frank Overton) engage in fisticuffs or worse with the newcomer, cityboy who succeeds in capturing his gal's heart.  Instead an odd alliance is actually formed when the decent hometown boyfriend breaks down and warns his rival of plots against him by the racist local populace.Lee Remick always cited her role WILD RIVER as the best of her career, which might surprise fans of DAYS OF WINE AND ROSES or ANATOMY OF A MURDER, but it makes sense.  Her character  here Carol Garth Baldwin is more multi-dimensional that the alcoholic Kirsten Arnesen Clay of the former film or the wanton Laura Manion of the latter.  Her scenes with Montgomery Clift have a ring of authenticity that is still quite rare in American film.  You feel as though you're eavesdropping on real conversations, actual heart-to-hearts.  And that's not easy to achieve.  Kazan and Co. did it here and it's a downright shame that the movie is so hard to get a hold of in its native land.",4,Classic Americana--Available Only In British Format.

931390,A30XR3EIN0IVA5,B000AQKZK4,Ronald E. Weber,"[4, 4]","This interesting little curiosity from 1960 has been little seen since it's initial release. I saw it originally as a noon movie in my high schooI, many moons ago.  But, since then, it's been difficult. It occasionally shows up on the Fox Movie station and probably now will start being on TCM, but basically, it's a forgotten film with a very strong collection of promotable names connected with it.It is a story of the depression, the workings of a the TVA (Tennessee Valley Authority,) and is about rural, desperately poor characters.  Obviously, it didn't make much noise when it appeared in theatres, originally, and has not been easy to see to see in a decent form, since then.But, this is prime work by a number of major film artists. Director Elia Kazan had apparently wanted to do something with this concept for many years, but couldn't get financing for such an artsy, non-commercial idea.  But after several successes in the '50's, it was finally green-lighted. Although it didn't make a dime, it remains one of his finest.  Montgomery Clift, after his '56 car accident disfigurement, had a real problem finding decent parts in big films.  Here he is, in a most unusual role, totally believable, completely vulnerable...a daring, very unconventional, hyper-sensitive kind of hero for a movie from any period. Lee Remick is perfect as an uneducated mountain widow, in probably the best performance of her career. And Jo Van Fleet, outdoes her Oscar winning role in EAST OF EDEN, as a stubborn old mountain woman in her eighties; a totally impressive feat when one considers she was forty-one when the film opened nationally.So, this is a really important dvd release; it rights a number of wrongs that have befallen this project from the beginning. Richard Shickel's commentary is very impressive, too.  As blu ray, there is little of any dazzling effect, but I'm sure it duplicated the way the original bland Fox Cinemascope, color by DeLuxe product looked.

931394,ACM90BRKX73OG,B000AQKZK4,Tom,"[7, 9]","Wild River (20th Century Fox, 1960) was director Elia Kazan's fourteenth film.Chuck Glover (Montgomery Clift), a Tenessee Valley Authority bureaucrat, arrives in a small town with the mission of removing the last remaining property owner holdout but eighty-year-old Ella Garth (Jo Van Fleet) has no intention of selling her soon-to-be-flooded river island. Her widowed granddaughter, Carol Baldwin (Lee Remick), is attracted to Glover and the two quickly form a relationship. Glover persuades Ella's Black workers to leave the island along with their families but she remains adamant. In the meantime, resentment simmers among the locals towards Glover's policy of paying Blacks the same wages as Whites. Carol aggressively pursues the ambivalent Glover, asking him to marry her, just as a mob arrives at her house to send Glover packing. He can only admire Carol's defiance of the rednecks and asks her to elope. A federal marshal is finally called in to evict Ella from the island. She is provided a small house but dies shortly after. On their way to Washington D.C. via airplane, Glover, Carol, and her two children view the river and the only portion of Ella's island still above water; the family cemetery containing her grave.Kazan filmed Wild River on location in Charleston, Tennessee and nearby environs. Close to one-hundred locals were used as extras. The picture was filmed in CinemaScope but we don't see the overtly wide pan shots we saw in East of Eden. Fractured, insecure, emotionally wounded Monty Clift barely held it together throughout the filming. Kazan's accounts of Clift's performance are quite interesting. While Kazan bragged that he bullied Clift into staying sober throughout the shoot, town lore has it that the McClary sisters regularly snuck liquor up to his room at the Cherokee Hotel. Twenty-five-year-old Lee Remick is wonderful as the beautiful, young, sexually aggressive widow. When she confidently and forcefully courts Clift it's all he can do to just sit there, leaving every heterosexual male viewer to ask, what's the matter with this numbskull? Watching Clift kiss Remick is as convincing as watching Michael Jackson kiss Lisa Marie Presley. Jo Van Fleet is superb as Ella, skillfully portraying the eighty-year-old matriarch at the age of forty-five. Albert Salmi is entertaining as the alpha good ol' boy. Kazan fans may be interested to know Salmi was married for a few years to ""A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"" star, Peggy Ann Garner. Kazan gave his mistress at that time, actress Barbara Loden, a small part in the film no doubt to help cope with the cool Tennessee fall evenings. Overall, it's a wonderful cast which includes several Kazan regulars.Wild River was one of Kazan's favorite films although its limited release guaranteed unprofitability. Kazan had been interested in directing a film about the Tennessee Valley Project for many years and tried to write the script himself but eventually hired screenwriter Paul Osborne. Kazan especially admired the conflict between Glover and Ella in which both held to positions that were simultaneously right and wrong. Relations between Blacks and Whites in the 1930's South are portrayed quite candidly.Commentary is provided by Time magazine film critic, Richard Schickel, who doesn't hide his admiration for Wild River or Lee Remick. This is a pretty good film but Remick's performance was Oscar-worthy.",4,Kazan tames the Wild River,1321228800,"11 14, 2011",2011,3401,"['Wild', 'River', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', '1960', 'was', 'director', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'fourteenth', 'film.Chuck', 'Glover', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'Tenessee', 'Valley', 'Authority', 'bureaucrat', 'small', 'town', 'mission', 'removing', 'last', 'remaining', 'property', 'owner', 'holdout', 'eighty-year-old', 'Ella', 'Garth', 'Jo', 'Van', 'Fleet', 'intention', 'selling', 'soon-to-be-flooded', 'river', 'island', 'widowed', 'granddaughter', 'Carol', 'Baldwin', 'Lee', 'Remick', 'attracted', 'Glover', 'two', 'quickly', 'form', 'relationship', 'Glover', 'Ella', 'Black', 'workers', 'leave', 'island', 'families', 'adamant', 'meantime', 'resentment', 'simmers', 'locals', 'towards', 'Glover', 'policy', 'paying', 'Blacks', 'same', 'wages', 'Whites', 'Carol', 'aggressively', 'ambivalent', 'Glover', 'asking', 'marry', 'just', 'mob', 'house', 'send', 'Glover', 'packing', 'can', 'only', 'admire', 'Carol', 'defiance', 'rednecks', 'elope', 'federal', 'marshal', 'finally', 'called', 'evict', 'Ella', 'island', 'provided', 'small', 'house', 'shortly', 'way', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'airplane', 'Glover', 'Carol', 'two', 'children', 'view', 'river', 'only', 'portion', 'Ella', 'island', 'still', 'water', 'family', 'cemetery', 'containing', 'grave.Kazan', 'filmed', 'Wild', 'River', 'location', 'Charleston', 'Tennessee', 'nearby', 'environs', 'Close', 'one-hundred', 'locals', 'were', 'used', 'extras', 'picture', 'was', 'filmed', 'CinemaScope', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'overtly', 'wide', 'pan', 'shots', 'saw', 'East', 'Eden', 'Fractured', 'insecure', 'emotionally', 'wounded', 'Monty', 'Clift', 'barely', 'held', 'together', 'filming', 'Kazan', 'accounts', 'Clift', 'performance', 'are', 'quite', 'interesting', 'Kazan', 'bragged', 'bullied', 'Clift', 'staying', 'sober', 'shoot', 'town', 'lore', 'McClary', 'sisters', 'regularly', 'snuck', 'up', 'room', 'Cherokee', 'Hotel', 'Twenty-five-year-old', 'Lee', 'Remick', 'wonderful', 'beautiful', 'young', 'sexually', 'aggressive', 'widow', 'When', 'confidently', 'forcefully', 'courts', 'Clift', 'can', 'do', 'just', 'sit', 'there', 'leaving', 'heterosexual', 'male', 'viewer', 'ask', 'what', 'matter', 'numbskull', 'Watching', 'Clift', 'kiss', 'Remick', 'as', 'convincing', 'watching', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'kiss', 'Lisa', 'Marie', 'Presley', 'Jo', 'Van', 'Fleet', 'superb', 'Ella', 'skillfully', 'portraying', 'eighty-year-old', 'matriarch', 'age', 'forty-five', 'Albert', 'Salmi', 'entertaining', 'alpha', 'good', 'ol', 'boy', 'Kazan', 'fans', 'may', 'be', 'interested', 'know', 'Salmi', 'was', 'married', 'few', 'years', 'A', 'Tree', 'Grows', 'Brooklyn', 'star', 'Peggy', 'Ann', 'Garner', 'Kazan', 'gave', 'mistress', 'time', 'actress', 'Barbara', 'Loden', 'small', 'part', 'film', 'doubt', 'help', 'cope', 'cool', 'Tennessee', 'fall', 'evenings', 'Overall', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'several', 'Kazan', 'regulars.Wild', 'River', 'was', 'one', 'Kazan', 'favorite', 'films', 'limited', 'release', 'guaranteed', 'unprofitability', 'Kazan', 'had', 'been', 'interested', 'directing', 'film', 'Tennessee', 'Valley', 'Project', 'many', 'years', 'tried', 'write', 'script', 'eventually', 'hired', 'screenwriter', 'Paul', 'Osborne', 'Kazan', 'especially', 'admired', 'conflict', 'Glover', 'Ella', 'held', 'positions', 'were', 'simultaneously', 'right', 'wrong', 'Relations', 'Blacks', 'Whites', '1930', 'South', 'are', 'portrayed', 'quite', 'candidly.Commentary', 'provided', 'Time', 'magazine', 'film', 'critic', 'Richard', 'Schickel', 'who', ""n't"", 'hide', 'admiration', 'Wild', 'River', 'Lee', 'Remick', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'Remick', 'performance', 'was', 'Oscar-worthy']",N/A
