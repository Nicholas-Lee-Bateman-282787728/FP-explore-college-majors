I saw enough to learn the subtitles are unreadably Chinglish, and that I won't understand the dialogue unless it's loud. The video is low quality, as if some guy pirated it with a camera in a theater. So I'm going to pick another time to watch it. I'm not in the mood tonight.It starts outside prison, which never happened in the original, and with Adam Sandler being difficult to watch as usual. If you've seen this, and if you love the NFL the way I do, tell me the truth. Is this crap?Oh, and let me share the cover blurb with you. ""Protect is a red very a fit of occupation rugby contestant ever, but was closed into because of a certain reason jail. The jail grows the cool love rugby, however born nature Endure. He hires the exclusively those excel the jail that play the rugby, letting them proceeding with prisoners' game."" Yeah, I think Roger Ebert wrote that.** UPDATED SEVERAL MONTHS LATER AFTER SEEING THE CORRECT DVD **The first eight minutes reminded me why I hate Adam Sandler. Actually, I didn't need that long. That's just how long it took to end the drunken party of a sort that only happens (I hope) in Hollywood movies with overworked stereotypes, and the car chase with cops who are overworked stereotypes. And Adam Sandler, himself an overworked stereotype portraying a character who is yet another overworked stereotype. Convinced that this was the only scene he and his peeps felt compelled to splice onto the original movie, all of which happens IN PRISON, I ejected the DVD and got back to it three days later.Segment three begins with Sandler's arrival in prison. However, it isn't a real prison. It only exists in Hollywood movies. It's where they lock up the cliches. I waded through ten more boring minutes of prison guard violence, brutal crotch hits and so-called wisecracks. The movie got better when Chris Rock appeared.""The movie got better when Chris Rock appeared."" I never thought I'd type those words.At last, the movie. What came before was backstory in the original film. I dunno why they felt they had to show it now when they were only going to tell it later, since it was too boring to show. Oh well.When this film got down to the football itself, that's when it got real. This one isn't for the girlie girls, okay? Since there were many NFL players in this film, football is what they know. Kinda surprising the prison wasn't more realistic, though, since many NFL players know that subject as well.I enjoyed the hell out of its juvenile humor in a testosterone-charged way. I appreciate what it has to say about football, prisons, violence, and whatever else it's on about. How brutal was the original? So brutal that this one was less so in spots. They tinkered with a few bits, but in a good way. A homage not a copy, they say. I agree. It's excellent. I'll keep it and watch it again, skipping the first 20 minutes or so, and I'll love the hell out of it. It's a damn shame to think everything else Sandler makes will probably suck like the parts of this movie I'll keep skipping.",4,The Longest Yard,1156723200,"08 28, 2006",2006,3094,"['love', 'original', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'good', 'things', 'one', 'saw', 'enough', 'learn', 'subtitles', 'are', 'unreadably', 'Chinglish', 'wo', ""n't"", 'understand', 'dialogue', 'loud', 'video', 'low', 'quality', 'guy', 'pirated', 'camera', 'theater', ""'m"", 'going', 'pick', 'time', 'watch', ""'m"", 'not', 'mood', 'tonight.It', 'prison', 'never', 'happened', 'original', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'being', 'difficult', 'watch', 'usual', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'love', 'NFL', 'way', 'do', 'tell', 'truth', 'crap', 'Oh', 'let', 'share', 'cover', 'blurb', 'Protect', 'red', 'very', 'fit', 'occupation', 'rugby', 'contestant', 'ever', 'was', 'closed', 'certain', 'reason', 'jail', 'jail', 'cool', 'love', 'rugby', 'however', 'born', 'nature', 'Endure', 'exclusively', 'jail', 'play', 'rugby', 'letting', 'proceeding', 'prisoners', 'game', 'Yeah', 'think', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'wrote', '**', 'UPDATED', 'SEVERAL', 'MONTHS', 'LATER', 'AFTER', 'SEEING', 'THE', 'CORRECT', 'DVD', '**The', 'first', 'eight', 'minutes', 'reminded', 'why', 'hate', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Actually', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'long', 'just', 'how', 'long', 'took', 'end', 'drunken', 'party', 'sort', 'only', 'hope', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'overworked', 'stereotypes', 'car', 'chase', 'cops', 'who', 'are', 'overworked', 'stereotypes', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'overworked', 'stereotype', 'portraying', 'character', 'who', 'yet', 'overworked', 'stereotype', 'Convinced', 'was', 'only', 'scene', 'peeps', 'felt', 'compelled', 'splice', 'original', 'movie', 'IN', 'PRISON', 'ejected', 'DVD', 'got', 'back', 'three', 'days', 'later.Segment', 'three', 'begins', 'Sandler', 'arrival', 'prison', 'However', ""n't"", 'real', 'prison', 'only', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'where', 'lock', 'up', 'cliches', 'waded', 'through', 'ten', 'more', 'boring', 'minutes', 'prison', 'guard', 'violence', 'brutal', 'crotch', 'hits', 'so-called', 'wisecracks', 'movie', 'got', 'better', 'when', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'appeared', 'movie', 'got', 'better', 'when', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'appeared', 'never', 'thought', ""'d"", 'type', 'words.At', 'last', 'movie', 'What', 'came', 'before', 'was', 'backstory', 'original', 'film', 'dunno', 'why', 'felt', 'had', 'show', 'now', 'when', 'were', 'only', 'going', 'tell', 'later', 'was', 'too', 'boring', 'show', 'Oh', 'well.When', 'film', 'got', 'down', 'football', 'when', 'got', 'real', 'one', ""n't"", 'girlie', 'girls', 'okay', 'were', 'many', 'NFL', 'players', 'film', 'football', 'what', 'know', 'Kinda', 'surprising', 'prison', 'was', ""n't"", 'more', 'realistic', 'though', 'many', 'NFL', 'players', 'know', 'subject', 'well.I', 'enjoyed', 'hell', 'juvenile', 'humor', 'testosterone-charged', 'way', 'appreciate', 'what', 'say', 'football', 'prisons', 'violence', 'else', 'about', 'How', 'brutal', 'was', 'original', 'So', 'brutal', 'one', 'was', 'less', 'so', 'spots', 'tinkered', 'few', 'bits', 'good', 'way', 'homage', 'not', 'copy', 'say', 'agree', 'excellent', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'watch', 'again', 'skipping', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'so', ""'ll"", 'love', 'hell', 'damn', 'shame', 'think', 'everything', 'else', 'Sandler', 'will', 'probably', 'suck', 'parts', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'skipping']",N/A
917763,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B000A0GP0Y,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[4, 6]","What did I like about this film?  Was there anything worth keeping with this nearly play by play remake that would make even the British version blush?  Outside of the hits and the music, there was absolutely nothing.  ""The Longest Yard"" was the sorriest sad sack of a comedy ever to be called a film.  While it tried to be identical to the first, it misses the mark mainly due to the characters, the cheap inserted jokes, and the obvious over budget.  Do we need to be spending millions of dollars to make the grass greener?  Before I begin, I want everyone to look at the box to this DVD - see Adam grinning - does he look tough enough, does he look like a QB, does he look like he can be hit by huge linebackers and live to tell?  My answer is no, and for you hoping to see a Happy Gilmore in a football jersey, you will be sadly disappointed.  This film was plastic wrap in its grandest of ways.  This film is Styrofoam when you really just needed a big belly laugh to ease the day.  This film was clich&eacute; after clich&eacute; with a VERY LOUD soundtrack.  How could this be?  Basically, this was the same film that Reynolds did a long time ago, but with Adam Sandler ... shouldn't it be funnier?Alas it wasn't.  How did this film fail?  After watching the original film, the British ""Mean Machine"", and finally this one, I came to realize that the spirit was just missing from the cast, the production, and the design.  While Sandler spewed the same lines that Reynolds did during his prime, it was difficult for me to see Sandler filling into Reynolds' boots.  The two actors are not the same, the age of America is different, and what originally was a creative film about self-discovery, turned into an over-budgeted film about trying to make the audience see those amazing hits that can be seen on ESPN.  Director Peter Segal has nobody to blame but himself.  ""The Longest Yard"" is one of those films that couldn't be remade today because the surrounding themes are obsolete.  The bulk of this issue falls on the casting.  I have already denounced Sandler, but Chris Rock is the icing on the cake.  He is absolutely not Caretaker.  He was not the smart, Jiminy Cricket-esque character that Crewe needed to see what was important to him in the long run.  When it comes to the quintessential pinch moment, there is no emotion - I literally didn't care what happened between the two.  They tried to be funny together with words, but the humor in the original fell in the situation, not Rock lounging around like this was his obvious first day at prison.  The rest of the story, with the miscast of these two, fell completely to the ground.  Sandler's cronies are there, Schnieder humiliating himself again, but Cromwell made me twitch again.  Where was his evil, his motive, his sinister tenacity?  Again, due to a much bigger budget, bigger stars, and a decision to make the punches bigger than the story, Segal let this film slip right out of his hands and into a failed category.Nothing worked in this film - at least I didn't think anything did until I finished the film and found myself humming a few bars from the music.  The music was way TOO LOUD - it distracted (like so many other elements of this remake) from the essential storylines, but it was perfect music for this film.  They strengthened the hits, made us feel like we were on the field with the team, and inspired us to root for the good guys - but the music alone doesn't create an amazing film (unless it is a musical - but I digress).  ""The Longest Yard"" suffered because of its poor character development, its poor casting decision, the painful story, and the insufferable direction.  Yet, the music remained a constant focus.  Thank you music team - it is the only one that I am handing out for this review.Overall, I hated this film.  It disgraced the original and I don't even find myself a fan of sports films.  If I had to rank these three films (the original, the remake, and the British) it would be a tight race between Vinnie Jones and young Reynolds - I thought that the Brits seemed to have a better grasp on what this film was trying to accomplish more than Segal did.  Sandler was a joke, Rock sunk to the bottom, and it was obvious that Reynolds was just in it for the nostalgic effect.  While the cameos by the ex-jocks would make any enthusiast drool, they try their best to hold up any remaining value to this film.  It took me two views to make it through this, while I can nearly recite all of the lines from ""Happy Gilmore"" or ""Billy Madison"".  That should be the perfect example of what horrid road Sandler has been traveling.  I would strongly suggest skipping this film.  Watch the original or import, but seem to know better what comedy is all about than Mr. Segal.Grade: * out of *****",1,Fumble.

I admit I mostly liked the Longest Yard because I'm a big WWE fan, and the film featured stars like ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin, The Great Khali, Goldberg, and Kevin Nash (and probably a few others).  It was, however, disappointing that Steve Austin was only featured in a few shots.  He should have played a bigger part.  Despite all the wrestler appearances, I would have probably liked this film anyway.I'm no fan of Chris Rock, but even he was pretty tolerable for the most part.  He played a nice guy in the film (well, as nice as a prisoner can be) and his parts were all pretty decent.I had to laugh at the end of the film when the guards thought Adam Sandler was trying to escape, so they pointed a gun to his head and thought about shooting, but changed their mind when they realized he was only walking away to pick up a football.

This situation would cause a great feeling of exhilaration among many inmates, and it happens to form the main plot of ""The Longest Yard"", a movie remake of the 1974 original that starred Burt Reynolds in the main role.In this updated version of Longest Yard, Adam Sandler stars as Paul Crewe. He is a man with a troubled past and a guilty conscience. He was once a professional football player, but was banned from the sport for fixing the outcome of a game by shaving points. This guilt has never quite left him and now, many years after the shameful scar from his past originated, he finds himself in prison. He is coerced by Warden Hazel- the man in charge of the prison and a guy with political aspirations- to put together a team of football players using other prisoners, with the goal in mind of pitting them against the guards of the prison in a nationally televised game. Sandler resists, but he ultimately gives in.This sports film offers some suspenseful moments and some good action. It also finds Sandler's character in a tough situation once more, when he is blackmailed by Warden Hazel into once again fixing a football game- this time, the actual game between the guards and the prisoners. Sandler has to make a difficult decision between taking the easy way out (fixing the game and avoiding a longer prison sentence) and doing what is ethical: Refusing to fix another game, like he did in the past, regardless of the consequences.Sandler is ok in his role as Paul Crewe, but I find myself a little resistant to accept him playing a semi- serious part. I say ""semi- serious"" because this film has many funny moments and Sandler fits it nicely during the comedic segments. But the more serious parts of the film seem a little awkward for Sandler. However, in the case of ""Longest Yard"", you don't seem to mind because the supporting cast is very good, and it includes Burt Reynolds (just like in the original movie), James Cromwell, Chris Rock, etc., along with several professional athletes, like Brian Bosworth, ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin, and others.Overall, this is a sports film with a generally positive message and a satisfying outcome.

First of all, everyone is going to have an immediate bias because you're not being original and also that the original was good and its a hard movie to live up to.  Luckily, Sandler and crew did a pretty good job of keeping the movie entertaining and funny.This movie is about ex-MVP qarterback Paul Crewes (Sandler).  He got kicked out of the NFL for fixing a playoff game.  So he goes on a drinking binge one night and gets arrested for reckless driving and a DUI.  When he goes to prison, he gets immediately harrassed by the guards and is not well liked by his fellow inmates.  Then the warden of the prison offers him to coach a team that would play his team of prison guards.  Obviously the prisoners want to cream the guards so they make a football team.  They practice really hard and play against the guards.  Sounds like something that you've heard before, right?First, I have to say that I'm glad that Adam Sandler's comedy has grown up a little bit.  Now he's targeting late teens to early twenties, rather than the 13-16 range of teens.  This movie is actually pretty funny.  Much of that has to go to Chris Rock's credit.  Theres a cast of wacky characters on both teams, but Chris Rock provides most of the film's jokes.  I guess the thing that bugged me about the film is that it is way too predictable.  You know whats gonna happen at the end and it takes away from the film.So my overall opinion would be to see this film.  Theres so good stuff in the film, and it does keep you entertained pretty much thoughout.  If you're bored one day or are a football/Sandler fan, then check out this film.

When the original came out in 1974, a six foot quarterback was still believable and the six foot eight giants of today were still rare.  Nowadays, someone who is five foot ten is simply too small except as a running back or a wide receiver.That aside, the movie does take a few twists from the original.  Some are good and some make the movie quite ridiculous.  I like the fact that the football to the groin is thrown at a crooked ref rather than a player.  One change I thought was particularly weak was making the idea of the guards playing the prisoners something new.  In the original it was something that happened every year, but the prisoners were simply beat up and the ""superstar"" was there to give them an edge.  Here, the quarterback is supposed build a team from nothing to a semi-pro quality team in a month.  I don't think so.  Another thing, Eddie Albert as the warden in the original is a lot more sinister than the mean but feckless James Cromwell is in this version.Anyway, this movie is about as raucous for our time as the original was for its.  However, the murder of caretaker is less gruesome and shocking in this remake than it was in the original.  If you want to watch Adam Sandler in a fairly mindless movie, this is OK.

This is one of the best remakes I have ever seen.One of the best things about the film is Sandler actually looks tired, beat, and downright exactly how I would picture a former NFL star quarterback who lost it all and ends up in jail.  Sandler proves that he has staying power with this film.Chris Rock (Caretaker) is excellent as the man to talk to and get the lowdown on prison life (more importantly, how to not end up someone's girlfriend).  Rock has some really funny lines, and he just seemd to fit this role better than I thought he would.  I think this is his greatest work yet, and I hope he just keeps moving up from here.  ""Hey, Chris, if you read this, thanks for making me laugh out loud after an eighty-hour work week!  You rock, Rock.""Burt Reynolds (Coach Nate Scarborough)didn't turn in the performance of a lifetime or anything, but he didn't do all that bad either.  The man has been through so much in his life, it was cool just to know he has bounced back so many times.  He's not a quitter, that's for sure.  I think he's a lot like the coach he played in the movie.  I still want to buy that Trans-Am from Smokey and The Bandit!  If you read this, Mr. Reynolds, can I at least take the T/A out for a weekend?  C'mon, I've spent a lot of loot on your films.William Fichtner (Captain Knauer) is always great in whatever role he plays.  From ""Grace Under Fire"" to ""Contact"" to ""The Longest Yard"", Fichtner is one of my favorite actors.  He never overacts.  He never underacts.  He just slides into a role as himself, and somehow makes it work like it's nobody's business.Nelly (Megget) has got skills - acting skills that is.  It was almost like he has been in jail before.  He was that good!  But best of all, he actually managed to pull off the small amount of talking parts and still be so memorable in the film.Megget: ""Y'all got a running back?""Paul Crewe: ""Not any good ones.""Ya gotta love it!Michael Irvin, Walter Williamson, David Patric Kelly (Warriors, come out to play!), Goldberg (Who's Next?), Terry Crews (with cheese), Bob Sapp (He broke-ded my nose), and the rest of the cast deserve all the credit in the world for coming together to make one of the best movie remakes in the history of film!This movie has a little bit of everything.

917786,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000A0GP0Y,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 2]","Let's face it.  Hitting refs with a football in their own very personal foul areas is just funny.  Fortunately, there's a lot more funny stuff where that came from in this comedic remake of The Longest Yard.  I was never a big fan of the original, so I can't compare and contrast the two here.  What I can say is that the remake, which milks as many stereotypes as it can find for all their comedic worth, is a genuinely funny movie.  There's no effort to make some kind of sociological argument here.  The Longest Yard is just a comedy, pure and simple.  Even the one serious moment in the film doesn't really hit you with anything more than surprise at what just happened.With the tandem of Adam Sandler and Chris Rock leading the way, you know you're going to do some laughing.  Combining two such heavyweight comedians in one film, though, is a handicap in some ways because your expectations may be too high going in.  That's probably why some viewers don't think the film is funny enough for their liking.  I think the inclusion of Burt Reynolds in the cast was a bit of risk, but the role of the old veteran really fits in perfectly with the script.  The rest of the cast is a hodgepodge of surprising faces: Cloris Leachman as the warden's lecherous (and thereby disgusting) secretary; professional wrestlers Bill Goldberg (who, like Burt Reynolds, did play college FB), Kevin Nash, and Steve Austin; former NFL players Michael Irvin (Michael Irvin as a prison inmate is perfect casting, if you ask me), Bill Romanowski, and Brian Bosworth (who was in the NFL only long enough for my man Bo Jackson to run him over on Monday Night Football).  With Sandler serving as executive director, you have to wonder how this motley crew of individuals could have been held together long enough to actually make a movie.  You can't argue with results, though.There's not much to the story.  Paul Crewe (Sandler) is a former NFL MVP whose career ended with a point shaving scandal.  Now, six years later, he seems determined to ruin his life completely and winds up in the big house, Texas-style.  The warden wants him to help get his prison guard football team in shape for the upcoming season, and he ends up recruiting a team of convicts to take on the guards in a pre-season game.  All of the inmates hated him at first, with the exception of Caretaker (Chris Rock), so he's got his work cut out even fielding a team, let alone teaching them how to play.  There are some bad dudes in the joint, though, and the opportunity to crack heads with the hated guards can be a pretty powerful recruiting tool.  The game itself turns into a big event, as ESPN2 and Chris Berman come in to broadcast it nation-wide.  You know everything that's going to happen, but it doesn't matter one iota.  The closest thing you get to suspense is your natural curiosity over the possibility of Burt Reynolds' overstretched face popping at any given moment.Is this Adam Sandler or Chris Rock at his best?  No, not by a long shot.  Still, it's a consistently funny film, and you just can't go too far wrong with a combination of comedy and football - not with male viewers, anyway.",4,You gotta protect your McNuggets!,1140912000,"02 26, 2006",2006,3157,"['Let', 'face', 'Hitting', 'refs', 'football', 'own', 'very', 'personal', 'foul', 'areas', 'just', 'funny', 'Fortunately', 'lot', 'more', 'funny', 'stuff', 'where', 'came', 'comedic', 'remake', 'Longest', 'Yard', 'was', 'never', 'big', 'fan', 'original', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'contrast', 'two', 'here', 'What', 'can', 'say', 'remake', 'milks', 'many', 'stereotypes', 'can', 'find', 'comedic', 'worth', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'movie', 'effort', 'make', 'kind', 'sociological', 'argument', 'here', 'Longest', 'Yard', 'just', 'comedy', 'pure', 'simple', 'Even', 'one', 'serious', 'moment', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'hit', 'anything', 'more', 'surprise', 'what', 'just', 'happened.With', 'tandem', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'leading', 'way', 'know', ""'re"", 'going', 'do', 'laughing', 'Combining', 'two', 'such', 'heavyweight', 'comedians', 'one', 'film', 'handicap', 'ways', 'expectations', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'high', 'going', 'probably', 'why', 'viewers', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'funny', 'enough', 'liking', 'think', 'inclusion', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'cast', 'was', 'bit', 'risk', 'role', 'old', 'veteran', 'really', 'perfectly', 'script', 'rest', 'cast', 'hodgepodge', 'surprising', 'Cloris', 'Leachman', 'warden', 'lecherous', 'thereby', 'disgusting', 'secretary', 'professional', 'wrestlers', 'Bill', 'Goldberg', 'who', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'did', 'play', 'college', 'FB', 'Kevin', 'Nash', 'Steve', 'Austin', 'former', 'NFL', 'players', 'Michael', 'Irvin', 'Michael', 'Irvin', 'prison', 'inmate', 'perfect', 'casting', 'ask', 'Bill', 'Romanowski', 'Brian', 'Bosworth', 'who', 'was', 'NFL', 'only', 'long', 'enough', 'man', 'Bo', 'Jackson', 'run', 'over', 'Monday', 'Night', 'Football', 'Sandler', 'serving', 'executive', 'director', 'have', 'wonder', 'how', 'motley', 'crew', 'individuals', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'held', 'together', 'long', 'enough', 'actually', 'make', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'argue', 'results', 'not', 'much', 'story', 'Paul', 'Crewe', 'Sandler', 'former', 'NFL', 'MVP', 'career', 'ended', 'point', 'shaving', 'scandal', 'Now', 'six', 'years', 'later', 'determined', 'ruin', 'life', 'completely', 'up', 'big', 'house', 'Texas-style', 'warden', 'help', 'get', 'prison', 'guard', 'football', 'team', 'shape', 'upcoming', 'season', 'up', 'recruiting', 'team', 'convicts', 'take', 'guards', 'pre-season', 'game', 'inmates', 'hated', 'first', 'exception', 'Caretaker', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'got', 'work', 'cut', 'out', 'even', 'fielding', 'team', 'let', 'alone', 'teaching', 'how', 'play', 'are', 'bad', 'dudes', 'joint', 'though', 'opportunity', 'crack', 'heads', 'hated', 'guards', 'can', 'be', 'pretty', 'powerful', 'recruiting', 'tool', 'game', 'big', 'event', 'ESPN2', 'Chris', 'Berman', 'come', 'broadcast', 'nation-wide', 'know', 'everything', 'going', 'happen', ""n't"", 'matter', 'one', 'iota', 'closest', 'thing', 'get', 'suspense', 'natural', 'curiosity', 'possibility', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'overstretched', 'face', 'popping', 'given', 'moment.Is', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'best', 'No', 'not', 'long', 'shot', 'Still', 'consistently', 'funny', 'film', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'too', 'far', 'wrong', 'combination', 'comedy', 'football', 'not', 'male', 'viewers', 'anyway']",N/A

Rather than live in the shadow of the original film, THE LONGEST YARD manages to set up a decent comedy of its own, despite being formulaic and cheesy at times.By now, you should be very familiar with the plot: Paul Crewe (Adam Sandler) is a former NFL star, who was indicted for throwing a game and has been recently picked up for reckless driving.  He gets the opportunity to round up a bunch of prison misfits to form a ""prisoner"" football team, set to go head-to-head with the prison guards.  Crewe's rag-tag bunch does remarkably well and the warden of the prison begins to worry about his chances of winning.  In turn, Crewe is faced with a moral dilemma: throw the game again and save his skin or play the game and risk his life.THE LONGEST YARD is the very definition of a formula comedy, but I still managed to eek out some entertainment from it.  The supporting cast is really quite superb if you take a close look at it.

If the film maker adds a lot or makes major changes, the allegation will be that he ruined the movie, that he was not true to the original. If the remake is similar to the original, people will ask, ""what was the point of remaking this movie? It was already done well the first time."" In other words, the film maker is damned if he/she does and damned if he/she doesn't. This film is true to the original. If you saw the original, you have seen everything of importance that occurs here. Still, I enjoyed the remake. One thing I really liked is that Burt Reynolds, who starred in the original was given a major role here. In this remake, he was cast as a coach who helps discredited former NFL quarterback, Paul Crewe, played by Adam Sandler ,put together a prison football team to take on a semipro team composed of prison guards.If you saw the first movie, there are no major twists or turns here that will add any suspense. You know from the first one what will happen. You have the same driven warden who wants to win at any cost. The plot is almost identical in each version. Still, a very different star in Adam Sandler, as opposed to Burt Reynolds, adds a different sort of humor since their on screen personas are so different from one another.

917790,A3GKOMCQTTWPUI,B000A0GP0Y,"David Foskin ""SneakyGoblin on XBL""","[3, 4]","Although less a review than a basic analogy, Peter Segal's 2005 remake of ""The Longest Yard"" is to Robert Aldrich's 1974 prison football epic as 2005 star Adam Sandler is to 1974 leading man Burt Reynolds.While Reynolds' Paul Crewe was a trademark '70s anti-hero, a pigskin-chucking sibling to the pragmatic rebels played by the likes of Jack Nicholson or Gene Hackman, the only real antecedent for Sandler's Crewe are the actor's own highly financially successful string of athletic loveable misfits, a character more intellectually gifted than Bobby Boucher of ""The Waterboy"" and more sedate than the title character in ""Happy Gilmore."" Reynolds could play self-destructive and willfully belligerent, a man who could demand and receive respect in the most precarious of situations. Even if he's trying to play a superstar jock, Sandler is a benign doofus, an Everyman as comfortable in a maximum security prison as Britney Spears would be at a Mensa meeting.Glossy where the original was gritty and raw, silly where the original was scabrously funny, cartoonish where the original was dangerous and threatening, this new ""Longest Yard"" aims only to be a diverting summer lark. With the help of a game and eclectic supporting cast and a spunky (but never convention-challenging) attitude, it succeeds admirably.Sheldon Turner's adapted screenplay stands by Tracy Keenan Wynn's original script down to the tiniest of plot details, lifting every twist and many of the most pointed conversations. Sandler is Paul ""Wrecking"" Crewe, a former NFL MVP quarterback booted from the league for allegedly fixing a game. He bottoms out in an elaborate escalating traffic violation that lands him in Allenville Federal Penitentiary, the personal fiefdom of Warden Hazen (James Cromwell), a martinet passionate about his prison football team and his own political aspirations. Distressed by his team's recent stumbles, the warden entrusts Crewe to put together a squad of inmates to go against the guards in what he assumes will be a season-opening rout. What he doesn't understand is that for the Mean Machine, this game will be a chance at revenge and vindication.Buried amidst the portrait of a disparate group of men bonding in adverse circumstances (a trademark Aldrich theme), the original ""Longest Yard,"" also questioned the rehabilitating possibilities of the penal system, with an interesting racial critique on the side. Sandler's version strips away most of the thematic richness, sprinkling cheap laughs on the already fertile framework like so much natural fertilizer. None of the changes in this new version is more telling than the reimagination of the warden's secretary, a lusty young Bernadette Peters in 1974, a randy and perverse (and hilarious) Cloris Leachman now. Throw in a gang of cross-dressing cheerleaders (led by Tracy Morgan), prison sodomy jokes galore and repeated references to the prodigious size of wrestler Bill Goldberg's, um, Gold-member and this ""Longest Yard"" isn't better, but it's probably funnier.Chris Rock assists with the wisecracking humor as Caretaker, one of those obligatory prison movie inmates who knows all of the loopholes and catches in the system. Rock's acerbic one-liners are sharper than anything else in the film conveying the impression that nobody forced him to stick to the script.The easy interplay between Rock and Sandler probably helped create a comfortable work environment for the cast's legion of non-thespians. The reliable character actors (Cromwell, William Fichtner), genuine football stars (Michael Irvin, Brian Bosworth and Bill Romanowski) and professional wrestlers (Goldberg, Steve Austin) blend perfectly. None of the non-actors embarrass themselves and Cowboys' great Irvin, stretching as a star wide receiver, and rapper Nelly, as an unstoppable running back, are big screen naturals. Less successful are the appearances by various ESPN personalities, particularly Chris Berman, who proves to be even more ingratiating when his shtick is written for him than when he works off the cuff.Reynolds shows up in an extended cameo and he even gets the movie star entrance, striding in purposeful slo-motion with the sun setting behind him, but his presence is mostly a reminder that even at a mind-bogglingly spry 69, he's more convincing as a sporting legend than Sandler.Although he and Sandler have had hits with their previous collaborations (""Anger Management,"" ""50 First Dates""), this is easily Segal's most accomplished film. Much of the credit probably goes to Oscar-winning cinematographer Dean Semler (""Dances with Wolves""), who works with Segal to deliver vigorous football action -- set, often music video-style, to an assortment of classic rock favorites and hip hop -- to accompany the comic scenes and even one or two moments of actual pathos.At some point this summer, a literate independent film will be released with an R-rating because of a fleeting glimpse of a nipple or because characters discuss a sexual relationship in an emotionally honest matter (something in the ""Raising Victor Vargas"" vein), preventing responsible young adults from seeing the movie. When that happens, I hope those filmmakers point to ""The Longest Yard"" and its PG-13 rating as a sign of the MPAA ratings board's ongoing hypocrisy. Whatever the limits are for casual verbal obscenity, crass dialogue and jokes about sexual deviance, this movie pushes them.Sandler's core audience of young male teens and frat boys will love this movie, but the Boys Club tone (Leachman and Courteney Cox, in a fleeting cameo, are the token females) may turn off distaff viewers who would rather see the funnyman romance Drew Berrymore than do hard time.",4,The Longest Yard (DVD),1138665600,"01 31, 2006",2006,5697,"['less', 'review', 'basic', 'analogy', 'Peter', 'Segal', '2005', 'remake', 'Longest', 'Yard', 'Robert', 'Aldrich', '1974',

The Longest Yard fails at being funny mainly because it tries too hard to be like many other sports comedies. It seems to use the same type of jokes over and over again (one liners and overuse of profanity for instance), and the same formulaic and predictable elements that you would find in any Adam Sandler movie.The characters are all typical prototypes. For instance, you have the corrupt warden of the prison who tries to get Adam Sandler's character to form a team that will seemingly be doomed. You have the big dumb guy who just likes to hit people, but wants to play. You have the fat guy who just wants to be a part of the team, and is the source of several jokes. You have the sidekick(Chris Rock) who knows everything about the prison, and is a willing participant to help Sandler's character out. You have Adam Sandler being the washed up athlete with a snobby girlfriend. You have Adam Sandler trying to turn a bunch of less-than-average football players into winners. You have the corrupt guards who try to bully some of the inmates, etc.It also doesn't help this movie to see cameos by the least respected sports personalities (such as Micheal Irvin and Bill Romanowski). I mean, I know it is suppose to be a tasteless comedy, but sheesh!There are certain funny points, sure, but this is a forgetable movie, and there are better and funnier Adam Sandler movies out there (Happy Gilmore and The Wedding Singer come to mind).

Williams ""TheFarisReel on Facebook""","[2, 5]","A remake of the 1974 classic The Longest Yard, this film features Adam Sandler, Chris Rock, and Burt Reynolds in a cons versus guards knockdown, drag-out, bare-knuckles brawl football game.  However, if you've seen the original, you've already seen this film as well, but done much better.The film centers around Paul Crewe (played by Sandler, but made famous by Reynolds), a former football all-star professional quarterback, who was forced to leave the sport after allegations of points-shaving surfaced.  The film opens several years after the allegations, and Crewe is a kept-man.  Forced jump at his girlfriend's every beckon call; Crewe flees their home intoxicated in his girlfriend's Bentley.  A high-speed pursuit ensues, the car is totaled, and Crewe is incarcerated in a federal prison for three years.The warden of the prison is an avid football fan, and the prison has its own semi-professional team.  The warden wants Crewe to coach his team; however, the guards would prefer that he not.  Stuck between a rock and a hard place, Crewe eventually agrees to assemble an all-convict team to scrimmage against the guards; with one catch, Crewe has to play quarterback.What a difference thirty years make.  In the original, you could almost believe this premise.  The film was set in some work-release prison in the bayous of the south, with chain gangs, and southern drawls; where you could almost feel the heat and desperation the convicts not to mention their total resentment toward the guards.  In this remake, the conviction just isn't present; plus, I really find it exceedingly hard to believe that any state would sanction this game, much less it being televised on ESPN.Anyways, I highly recommend watching the original, rather than this 21st century reincarnation of the same.

He's a drunk these days, and in his drunkeness takes off with his rich girlfriend's car, where he ends up in a mad car chase and a colossal crash. He is sentenced to three years jail, in a prison full of wardens and guards who take a little too much pleasure in punishing the prisoners. The guards have a football team, and since Crewe was once a professional football player, they turn to him for advice. Crewe suggests they play a game against a weaker side and beat them to get their confidence up. The guard's agree and get Crewe to make the weaker team, out of the prisoners! Crewe agrees and convinces his cellmates (who he isn't too popular with) to try out. Will they agree to join the team? If they do, will Crewe force them to lose?I remember back in high school, there was this really funny guy in our drama class. He was a fan of Adam Sandler, actually. Anyway, whenever we'd do improvisation, everyone would expect him to do something really funny. He'd end up just going through the motions, kind of a little tired and deadpan. It's kind of how Adam Sandler plays ""Wrecking"" Crewe. Maybe Mr Sandler's heart wasn't in this film, maybe making all these films are exhausting him, I don't know. His dialogue gives the impression that the character's kind of rebellious, but from Sandler's performance, I didn't exactly know why. Sandler's best acting here is when he has to get himself hyped up, like in the drunken car chase.Chris Rock, who plays the friendly cellmate Caretaker, is his usual chirpy self. The inmates are well cast, and are all interesting enough characters. Though they're criminals, they're likeable, and I ended up wanting to see them win. Being a Adam Sandler film, Rob Schneider makes a cameo, as he always does. Oh dear...I don't know that much about American football, but the football parts of this film were easy enough to follow. The teams strategize, play plays and such, and you don't really need to know what they are, which is good.Three and a half stars, but I'll round up to four. Worth a look for Adam Sandler fans.

Adam Sandler plays Paul Crewe, an former NFL player who was kicked out of the sport after being suspected of throwing a game.  Down on his luck, Paul Crewe gets thrown into jail after drunkingly driving his girlfriend's car on national television.While in jail he is convinced to put together a football team made up entirely of convicts to go against the prison guards.  Burt Renolds, who starred as Paul Crewe in the 1974 movie, plays the coach of the Mean Machine team.  Chris Rock also plays Caretaker who comes up with many of the plays.  The rap artist Nelly plays a very fast running back and James Cromwell, the warden from The Green Mile, plays the Warden of the jail in this movie.A lot of this movie is a scene by scene, line by line remake of the original except that a lot of the language and racial references were toned down.  The original movie was rated R but I think they figured out that they would make more money with a PG-13 movie and replaced all but one F-word with substitutes, most of them being the more widely accepted S-word.  This might have worked because the movie actually made some decent money and the teenage crowd was a large contributor to the ticket sales.  In fact, I wouldn't have seen this if it had retained its R rating.I think most would agree that this wasn't as good as the original, but it is still just as funny though a lot of the darker humor from the original movie has been replaced with something a bit more slapstick.  There are many running gags but the one that killed me the most was replacing one guard's steroids with female hormones instead.  Throughout the movie you see him acting more and more feminine.  Of course, hillarity ensues.I wouldn't recommend this for any youngster as they flirted with an R rating and probably came just short of earning it.  If you are looking for a movie that will inspire you to be good or make you a better person, this is not it.

This is actually the first time I've wanted to see a remake, and I caught it the weekend it came out. And I must say, I was entertained the whole time. I think if you look at this movie as a football comedy, and not try to compare it to the Burt Reynolds version, you'll enjoy it. I think a lot of people are turned off by this movie for that reason, and because they see this as being nothing more than ""The Waterboy Pt. 2"". But it's not, despite the cameo by Rob Schneider (sp?), which honestly, I could've done without. The characters could've been a little more developed...I mean, why should we root for the ""Mean Machine"", other than the fact that the guards were really corrupt? With no character development, it just seemed like we were rooting for the lesser of two evils. The library racism scene w/Nelly was a nice start, but there could've been a few more scenes like that.  Like I said, it's a pretty entertaining movie, once you realize that 1) it's not the Burt Reynolds version, and 2) it's not trying to be. If you're a football fan, you'll like this movie. The game will probably get you energized, especially the last moments of the game.

I like Sandler but I think he chews scenery too much in most his movies. Plus they all have the ""YOU CAN DO IT!!"" plot. He has to go against all the odds with everyone rooting for him by the end. Sure the Longest Yard isn't that much different than his usual movies. Still it's funner and for once it's just not only about Sandler's character.Richard Roeper totally tore the movie apart. He said that Chris Rock is in another forgettable role. He's just picking on him due to Rock's comments on Jude Law at the Oscars's though. I'm not the biggest Rock fan and didn't like those comments either. However he does shine here and does have the best lines. I also like the wrestlers in the film that star in supporting roles. You have Kevin Nash as a prison guard who  gets his steroids replaced with estrogen. He's pretty funny in the movie, he doesn't have the potential of the Rock. Still scenes like where he asks the other gaurds why his nipples are so hard are pretty funny.Goldberg is funny as a  prisoner who's nickname for his private part is ""the Sledgehammer"". Stone Cold Steve Austin also stars as a prejudice prison guard. He doesn't get as much to do as Nash and Goldberg. The WWE was promoting the movie by mentioning just Austin and talking about his potential as an actor. If there's potential you don't get to see it that much in this movie. Sandler got knocked by Roeper for not being believeable as a football player. I think he's much more believeable here as one than in the Waterboy though. Plus quarterbacks don't have to be that big. I mean Jamie Fox isn't the biggest guy either and he played a quarterback in Any Given Sunday. I think Sandler pulls off the role fine. This is his best comefy I think. I can't count how many times I laughed. Most football comedies think they need a bar fight in-order to be funny.

I would say that some of the acting was ""entertaining"", but I can just go on and on on the holes in believe-ability, which usually ruin it for me (yes, even though it's a movie!). The believe-ability has to be taken into context, of course (ie-sciene fiction or superhero movies need to be taken in that context)..but this was supposed to a regular sports drama on this planet anyway, right? Here are just SOME of the parts that made me throw popcorn at the movie:-Car chase scene is in downtown Long Beach (clearly with the convention center and Gameworks arcade in the back), but the cop cars say ""San Diego Police"".-There were a few scenes where the prisoners sneak into prohibited areas of the prison to break into the computer system or medical records....oh please...is it that easy??-If Crewe (Sandler) didn't really have an incentive to win from the start (his incentive was to just set up a team to lose to the guards) then why would he go out of his way to recruit such talented players and even risk physical harm to get them to join the team (ie- playing b-ball with Deacon)-So, there are a group of tranvestite gay prisoners just prancing around in prison now?? And they get their own chearleader outfits and get to cheer at the game??? Come on~~ Tracy Morgan could have been better used as a player/prisoner in this movie than as a gay cheerleader...the whole gay cheerleaders portion was actually not necessary to the storyline development at all...and not realistic.-The scene where the guards take Crewe out to talk to the warden while he's playing golf with his important friends doesn't make sense. So, they would actually escort a prisoner out to the golf course just because he wanted to talk to the warden about the game? Couldn't they just have told him to wait until the warden returned? It wasn't that urgent.-If the referees were ""on the payroll"", then why didn't they do anything when Crewe kept hitting that one ref in the balls?? And why would they call touchdown on the last play when it was questionable he was out of bounds?-The prisoner commentator that was put next to Berman (whatever his name is from ESPN) was absolutely unnecessary and not even funny...like they would actually put somebody like that who doesn't even talk as a co-commentator...ok...-They mentioned Nate Scarsborough (Burt Reynolds) didn't play football since 1955....hm...that would make him about 72? And he would still be willing to run the ball on that one play and get hit in mid-air like that? This isn't ""Rocky Balboa"" guys.-And worst of all...I know Adam Sandler produced the movie, but why you use HIM? He doesn't look athletic or strong like a quarterback and he's far from handsome, which the character is supposed to be.There are other holes that insulted me as a viewer, but if you can get beyond many of them and just enjoy some of the funny acting...then it might be decent...but definitely not worth more than 3 stars.  They had a good basic storyline, but just some of the details that were put in (either for humor or lack of common-sense of the real world) just ruined it for me.",2,"Entertaining, but just too many holes in the movie kept me from totally enjoying it",1258070400,"11 13, 2009",2009,3199,"['were', 'just', 'too', 'many', 'holes', 'movie', 'prevented', 'giving', '4', 'star', 'review', 'would', 'say', 'acting', 'was', 'entertaining', 'can', 'just', 'go', 'holes', 'believe-ability', 'usually', 'ruin', 'yes', 'even', 'movie', 'believe-ability', 'be', 'taken', 'context', 'course', 'ie-sciene', 'fiction', 'superhero', 'movies', 'need', 'be', 'taken', 'context', '..but', 'was', 'supposed', 'regular', 'sports', 'drama', 'planet', 'anyway', 'right', 'Here', 'are', 'just', 'SOME', 'parts', 'made', 'throw', 'popcorn', 'movie', '-Car', 'chase', 'scene', 'downtown', 'Long', 'Beach', 'clearly', 'convention', 'center', 'Gameworks', 'arcade', 'back', 'cop', 'cars', 'say', 'San', 'Diego', 'Police', '.-There', 'were', 'few', 'scenes', 'where', 'prisoners', 'sneak', 'prohibited', 'areas', 'prison', 'break', 'computer', 'system', 'medical', 'records', '.oh', 'please', 'easy', '-If', 'Crewe', 'Sandler', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'incentive', 'win', 'start', 'incentive', 'was', 'just', 'set', 'up', 'team', 'lose', 'guards', 'then', 'why', 'would', 'go', 'way', 'recruit', 'such', 'talented', 'players', 'even', 'risk', 'physical', 'harm', 'get', 'join', 'team', 'ie-', 'playing', 'b-ball', 'Deacon', '-So', 'are', 'group', 'tranvestite', 'gay', 'prisoners', 'just', 'prancing', 'around', 'prison', 'now', 'get', 'own', 'chearleader', 'outfits', 'get', 'cheer', 'game', 'Come', 'Tracy', 'Morgan', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'used', 'player/prisoner', 'movie', 'gay', 'cheerleader', 'whole', 'gay', 'cheerleaders', 'portion', 'was', 'actually', 'not', 'necessary', 'storyline', 'development', 'not', 'realistic.-The', 'scene', 'where', 'guards', 'take', 'Crewe', 'talk', 'warden', 'playing', 'golf', 'important', 'friends', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'So', 'would', 'actually', 'escort', 'prisoner', 'golf', 'course', 'just', 'wanted', 'talk', 'warden', 'game', 'Could', ""n't"", 'just', 'have', 'told', 'wait', 'warden', 'returned', 'was', ""n't"", 'urgent.-If', 'referees', 'were', 'payroll', 'then', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'when', 'Crewe', 'kept', 'hitting', 'one', 'ref', 'balls', 'why', 'would', 'call', 'touchdown', 'last', 'play', 'when', 'was', 'questionable', 'was', 'bounds', '-The', 'prisoner', 'commentator', 'was', 'put', 'next', 'Berman', 'name', 'ESPN', 'was', 'absolutely', 'unnecessary', 'not', 'even', 'funny', 'would', 'actually', 'put', 'somebody', 'who', ""n't"", 'even', 'talk', 'co-commentator', 'ok', '-They', 'mentioned', 'Nate', 'Scarsborough', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'did', ""n't"", 'play', 'football', '1955', '.hm', 'would', 'make', '72', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'willing', 'run', 'ball', 'one', 'play', 'get', 'hit', 'mid-air', ""n't"", 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'guys.-And', 'worst', 'know', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'produced', 'movie', 'why', 'use', 'HIM', ""n't"", 'look', 'athletic', 'strong', 'quarterback', 'far', 'handsome', 'character', 'supposed', 'are', 'other', 'holes', 'insulted', 'viewer', 'can', 'get', 'many', 'just', 'enjoy', 'funny', 'acting', 'then', 'might', 'be', 'decent', 'definitely', 'not', 'more', '3', 'stars', 'had', 'good', 'basic', 'storyline', 'just', 'details', 'were', 'put', 'humor', 'lack', 'common-sense', 'real', 'world', 'just', 'ruined']",N/A

There is actually a better film buried underneath all the MTV-style glitz and bull, but the filmmakers tried too hard to ensure that no clich&eacute; or gimmick went unused. We get an uneasy mish-mash of a real film with real actors (Cromwell, Fitchner, Reynolds, etc.) and a cheezy music video with rappers (Nelly) cameos of pro wrestlers (Stone Cold, Goldberg, etc.). Another big problem is the terrible casting of Adam Sandler as a pro football star and overall tough guy. Hello! The guy is too small and fragile-looking to play in a high school league, let alone the pros. Everyone else in the film literally towers over Sandler, including even the old warden, making him look even more puny.

917813,A27CHILBK6HIL2,B000A0GP0Y,Kaya Savas,"[30, 64]","MOVIE: Here we have another watered down remake that tries to take a very well done film and open it to the general public.  The film, while although enjoyable at times, is full of cheap humor, bad dialogue, and illogical events.  The story follows Paul Crewe, a washed up pro quarterback who lands himself a 3 year sentence for getting drunk and stealing his girlfriend's very nice car.  In the original instead of arguing with his girlfriend he beats her and then steals the car, so we already know that any seriousness from the original is lost.  The very first shot of the film is a flashy split screen shot of a girl swimming in the pool in her bikini.  The camera follows her out of the pool to reveal a big party going on, then we follow Courtney Cox Arquette upstairs to find her lovely boyfriend all drunk and watching football.  All the camera does is focus on her bulging bosoms for her entire 5 minute screen time.  We already know the target audience so it's not a shock, but it's just degrading to the original work it's being based off of.  Once Crewe is ordered to assemble a team to face the guards as a ""practice"" game then the eye rolling will come.  You watch and think to yourself, ""These guys are criminals?""  I mean they are all little annoying asses, and the jokes are also tasteless.  Tracy Morgan makes a cameo as the head of the gay guys in the prison, and they become the cheerleaders for the convict team, yeah ha-ha, gay jokes, men in skimpy clothing with pom-poms.  Later, when Sandler is recruiting players he goes to see this huge hispanic guy who is locked up in a room that shares the likes of Hannibal Lecter's cell in Silence of the Lambs.  Sandler finds him banging his head against the concrete and asks ""what's his problem"", the guard replies ""he's crazy"".  Maybe that's how they'll depict Hannibal Lecter in the remake 20 years from now.  So, once they finally recruit this guy who was being guarded 24 hours a day in a room with bullet proof paneling, he is let out to play.  That's right, they just let him out of his hold so that he can practice football, no guards supervising.  The turning point of the film is so out of place because they try to make it serious, and it just doesn't flow with the tone the movie already established.  As for the entire plot, it does not stray away from the formula one bit.  C'mon, guess who wins at the end.  It's not hard since you know what is coming.  They assemble the team, they practice, all odds are against them, they have to overcome the death of a friend (won't say who though), Sandler has to choose between being faithful to his team or be selfish and throw the game . . .  guess the ending.  I thought Burt Reynolds would come to lift this movie, but he didn't.  I laughed out loud maybe 5 or 6 times.  Don't get me wrong, I like Adam Sandler, but this movie is lacking any social commentary and impact that the original had, just like his other remake, Mr. Deeds.  What is Sandler trying to do? Remake classics into crappy comedies? Whatever it is, it's not too hot.ACTING:  You won't buy Adam Sandler as an all pro quarterback for one bit, not at all.  You'd think he'd do some body building for the role, but nah-uh.  As for his acting, he acts the same throughout, and it's funny that he has no funny moments in the film.  It's all the supporting cast of cameos and nobodies.  Don't worry, Rob Schnieder is there like he always is with the ""You can do it!"" line.  He also gets Allen Covert in there as he usually does with his movies.  Chris Rock is pretty unfunny too.  All the funny comes from the wimpy convicts and some mega slowmotion football hits as a huge guy knocks down the little guy.  Those are always funny.BOTTOM LINE: The original had a social commentary, it was a stronger film.  This film shouldn't carry the same name because it's just a tasteless mix of big hits, crappy jokes, and illogic.  It's also filled up the whazoo with Reebok product placement.",3,"A Very Annoying, Borring, and Tasteless Movie",1117497600,"05 31, 2005",2005,3970,"['MOVIE', 'Here', 'have', 'watered', 'down', 'remake', 'take', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'film', 'open', 'general', 'public', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'times', 'full', 'cheap', 'humor', 'bad', 'dialogue', 'illogical', 'events', 'story', 'Paul', 'Crewe', 'washed', 'up', 'pro', 'quarterback', 'who', '3', 'year', 'sentence', 'getting', 'drunk', 'stealing', 'girlfriend', 'very', 'nice', 'car', 'original', 'instead', 'arguing', 'girlfriend', 'then', 'steals', 'car', 'already', 'know', 'seriousness', 'original', 'lost', 'very', 'first', 'shot', 'film', 'flashy', 'split', 'screen', 'shot', 'girl', 'swimming', 'pool', 'bikini', 'camera', 'out', 'pool', 'reveal', 'big', 'party', 'going', 'then', 'follow', 'Courtney', 'Cox', 'Arquette', 'find', 'lovely', 'boyfriend', 'drunk', 'watching', 'football', 'camera', 'focus', 'bulging', 'bosoms', 'entire', '5', 'minute', 'screen', 'time', 'already', 'know', 'target', 'audience', 'not', 'shock', 'just', 'degrading', 'original', 'work', 'being', 'based', 'Once', 'Crewe', 'ordered', 'assemble', 'team', 'face', 'guards', 'practice', 'game', 'then', 'eye', 'rolling', 'will', 'come', 'watch', 'think', 'yourself', 'guys', 'are', 'criminals', 'mean', 'are', 'little', 'annoying', 'asses', 'jokes', 'are', 'also', 'tasteless', 'Tracy', 'Morgan', 'cameo', 'head', 'gay', 'guys', 'prison', 'become', 'cheerleaders', 'convict', 'team', 'yeah', 'ha-ha', 'gay', 'jokes', 'men', 'skimpy', 'clothing', 'pom-poms', 'Later', 'when', 'Sandler', 'recruiting', 'players', 'see', 'huge', 'hispanic', 'guy', 'who', 'locked', 'up', 'room', 'shares', 'likes', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', 'cell', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'Sandler', 'banging', 'head', 'concrete', 'what', 'problem', 'guard', 'crazy', 'Maybe', 'how', ""'ll"", 'depict', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', 'remake', '20', 'years', 'now', 'So', 'once', 'finally', 'recruit', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'being', 'guarded', '24', 'hours', 'day', 'room', 'bullet', 'proof', 'paneling', 'let', 'play', 'right', 'just', 'let', 'hold', 'so', 'can', 'practice', 'football', 'guards', 'supervising', 'turning', 'point', 'film', 'so', 'place', 'try', 'make', 'serious', 'just', ""n't"", 'flow', 'tone', 'movie', 'already', 'established', 'entire', 'plot', 'not', 'stray', 'away', 'formula', 'one', 'bit', ""C'mon"", 'guess', 'who', 'end', 'not', 'hard', 'know', 'what', 'coming', 'assemble', 'team', 'practice', 'odds', 'are', 'have', 'overcome', 'death', 'friend', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'who', 'Sandler', 'choose', 'being', 'faithful', 'team', 'be', 'selfish', 'throw', 'game', 'guess', 'ending', 'thought', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'would', 'come', 'lift', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'maybe', '5', '6', 'times', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'like', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'movie', 'lacking', 'social', 'commentary', 'impact', 'original', 'had', 'just', 'other', 'remake', 'Mr', 'Deeds', 'What', 'Sandler', 'trying', 'do', 'Remake', 'classics', 'crappy', 'comedies', 'not', 'too', 'hot.ACTING', 'wo', ""n't"", 'buy', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'pro', 'quarterback', 'one', 'bit', 'not', ""'d"", 'think', ""'d"", 'do', 'body', 'building', 'role', 'nah-uh', 'acting', 'same', 'funny', 'funny', 'moments', 'film', 'supporting', 'cast', 'cameos', 'nobodies', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'Rob', 'Schnieder', 'there', 'always', 'can', 'do', 'line', 'also', 'Allen', 'Covert', 'there', 'usually', 'movies', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'pretty', 'unfunny', 'too', 'funny', 'wimpy', 'convicts', 'mega', 'slowmotion', 'football', 'huge', 'guy', 'knocks', 'down', 'little', 'guy', 'are', 'always', 'funny.BOTTOM', 'LINE', 'original', 'had', 'social', 'commentary', 'was', 'stronger', 'film', 'film', 'should', ""n't"", 'carry', 'same', 'name', 'just', 'tasteless', 'mix', 'big', 'hits', 'crappy', 'jokes', 'illogic', 'also', 'filled', 'up', 'whazoo', 'Reebok', 'product', 'placement']",N/A

However, this remake is rather amusing, even though it does not measure up with the original.  The cast is decent and the story amusing without much greatness to be pondered, which leaves the audience with an enjoyable cinematic experience that is worth a viewing and several laughs.In football, individuals put in hundreds of hours over the off-season in the weight room to get into ideal shape and the team polishes its plays to perfection through countless hours of preparation by coaches and players.  Despite all the preparations, one single mistake could break the whole situation, which could possibly result in a loss, or injury.  This in turn could have a downward spiraling affect on the team as a whole and affect the whole season.  Thus, when it happens, the coach is usually in the face of the player to make sure that it never happens again, as mistakes are what separate the winners from the losers.  This is why football is the ultimate team sport. In the testosterone pumped remake The Longest Yard, Paul Crewe (Adam Sandler) embodies the mistake of all mistakes in a football career, as he is sent to prison for the theft of his girlfriend's Bentley.Paul Crewe destroyed the valiant notion of hard work and dedication that surrounds football some years before the film takes place by shaving points in a football game for personal gain.  In disgrace, Crewe has withdrawn from public life while his girlfriend, played by Courteney Cox Arquette, flourishes in exposure.  This personal conflict between the two leads the drunken Crewe to steal her car, as she has it reported stolen.  The combination of alcohol, smart mouthing, and the car theft among other things lands Crewe a lengthy prison term in the Texas penal system.  Crewe ends up in Texas due to Warden Hazen (James Cromwell) who has pulled some strings to have Crewe sentenced in his prison, as he wants to win the Texas penitentiary league.When Crewe arrives to the prison, he quickly learns that both the guards and the inmates do not desire his presence.  This is also one of the reasons why he declines to help the Warden, as the guards are disgusted by his past in the professional league where he was appointed the most valuable player.  Immediately Crewe sets an example through which he acquires some respect, but it also means that he must help the warden.  He finds himself suggesting that the guards should play a tune-up game against some bad players, which gives Hazen the idea of a game between the guards and the inmates.At first, some inmates join up with Crewe, but there is a severe lack of talent among the prisoners and many of them are suspicious about Crewe.  Eventually, some talent emerges out of the secret hiding places and offers services to the team.  Many join the team to get a chance to repay the guards for years of humiliation and pain.  With the help of former Heisman winner Nate Scarborough (Burt Reynolds) and Caretaker (Chris Rock) Crewe has four weeks to prepare this rowdy bunch into a well-oiled Mean Machine that will be ready to stomp the guards.  However, it is not a painless journey for Crewe and company, as they face much adversity from within the prison while the heat begins to build up for a game that is beginning to gain national attention.Once again, Peter Segal partners up with Adam Sandler with whom he made Anger Management (2003) and 50 First Dates (2004), but it is not where Segal began his career directing comedies.  It is clear that Segal possess the skill of delivering decent comedies, yet much of the humor in the film is unoriginal and recognizable from other films.  Despite the formulaic approach, Segal succeeds in creating an entertaining concept that works and offers both humor and drama.  Some of the success might be due to that the film staying close to the original by Robert Aldrich from 1974 with Burt Reynolds.  Whatever it is in the film that makes it work, it ends up creating a story of trust, unity, and loyalty, which emerges in one of the least likely places in the world - prison.",4,Remake Offering a Terrific Guilty Pleasure...,1127260800,"09 21, 2005",2005,4138,"['Remakes', 'usually', 'surface', 'bubbles', 'bathtub', 'expected', 'reeking', 'sensation', 'However', 'remake', 'rather', 'amusing', 'even', 'not', 'measure', 'up', 'original', 'cast', 'decent', 'story', 'amusing', 'much', 'greatness', 'be', 'pondered', 'audience', 'enjoyable', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'viewing', 'several', 'laughs.In', 'football', 'individuals', 'put', 'hundreds', 'hours', 'off-season', 'weight', 'room', 'get', 'ideal', 'shape', 'team', 'plays', 'perfection', 'countless', 'hours', 'preparation', 'coaches', 'players', 'preparations', 'one', 'single', 'mistake', 'could', 'break', 'whole', 'situation', 'could', 'possibly', 'result', 'loss', 'injury', 'turn', 'could', 'have', 'downward', 'spiraling', 'affect', 'team', 'whole', 'affect', 'whole', 'season', 'Thus', 'when', 'coach', 'usually', 'face', 'player', 'make', 'sure', 'never', 'again', 'mistakes', 'are', 'what', 'separate', 'winners', 'losers', 'why', 'football', 'ultimate', 'team', 'sport', 'testosterone', 'pumped', 'remake', 'Longest', 'Yard', 'Paul', 'Crewe', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'mistake', 'mistakes', 'football', 'career', 'sent', 'prison', 'theft', 'girlfriend', 'Bentley.Paul', 'Crewe', 'destroyed', 'valiant', 'notion', 'hard', 'work', 'dedication', 'football', 'years', 'film', 'place', 'shaving', 'points', 'football', 'game', 'personal', 'gain', 'disgrace', 'Crewe', 'withdrawn', 'public', 'life', 'girlfriend', 'played', 'Courteney', 'Cox', 'Arquette', 'flourishes', 'exposure', 'personal', 'conflict', 'two', 'drunken', 'Crewe', 'steal', 'car', 'reported', 'stolen', 'combination', 'alcohol', 'smart', 'mouthing', 'car', 'theft', 'other', 'things', 'Crewe', 'lengthy', 'prison', 'term', 'Texas', 'penal', 'system', 'Crewe', 'up', 'Texas', 'due', 'Warden', 'Hazen', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'who', 'pulled', 'strings', 'have', 'Crewe', 'sentenced', 'prison', 'win', 'Texas', 'penitentiary', 'league.When', 'Crewe', 'prison', 'quickly', 'guards', 'inmates', 'do', 'not', 'desire', 'presence', 'also', 'one', 'reasons', 'why', 'help', 'Warden', 'guards', 'are', 'disgusted', 'past', 'professional', 'league', 'where', 'was', 'appointed', 'most', 'valuable', 'player', 'Immediately', 'Crewe', 'example', 'respect', 'also', 'must', 'help', 'warden', 'suggesting', 'guards', 'should', 'play', 'tune-up', 'game', 'bad', 'players', 'Hazen', 'idea', 'game', 'guards', 'inmates.At', 'first', 'inmates', 'join', 'up', 'Crewe', 'severe', 'lack', 'talent', 'prisoners', 'many', 'are', 'suspicious', 'Crewe', 'Eventually', 'talent', 'secret', 'hiding', 'places', 'offers', 'services', 'team', 'Many', 'join', 'team', 'get', 'chance', 'repay', 'guards', 'years', 'humiliation', 'pain', 'help', 'former', 'Heisman', 'winner', 'Nate', 'Scarborough', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'Caretaker', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'Crewe', 'four', 'weeks', 'prepare', 'rowdy', 'bunch', 'well-oiled', 'Mean', 'Machine', 'will', 'be', 'ready', 'stomp', 'guards', 'However', 'not', 'painless', 'journey', 'Crewe', 'company', 'face', 'much', 'adversity', 'prison', 'heat', 'build', 'up', 'game', 'beginning', 'gain', 'national', 'attention.Once', 'again', 'Peter', 'Segal', 'partners', 'up', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'whom', 'made', 'Anger', 'Management', '2003', '50', 'First', 'Dates', '2004', 'not', 'where', 'Segal', 'began', 'career', 'directing', 'comedies', 'clear', 'Segal', 'possess', 'skill', 'delivering', 'decent', 'comedies', 'yet', 'much', 'humor', 'film', 'unoriginal', 'recognizable', 'other', 'films', 'formulaic', 'approach', 'Segal', 'creating', 'entertaining', 'concept', 'humor', 'drama', 'success', 'might', 'be', 'due', 'film', 'staying', 'close', 'original', 'Robert', 'Aldrich', '1974', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'Whatever', 'film', 'work', 'up', 'creating', 'story', 'trust', 'unity', 'loyalty', 'one', 'least', 'likely', 'places', 'world', 'prison']",N/A

By now it's a familiar tale of a bunch of criminal rejects that somehow are made to look better than the (as always) oppressive establishment. In this case it's the evil prison guards and the heartless warden. Adam Sandler is convincing in the title role and there are a couple of memorable performances. Especially Courtney Cox who nearly steals the movie in what is maybe a 10 minute total walk on appearance. Her new and improved body are housed in spectacular red dress that should have the men using their remote controls over and over again! But 10 minutes of beauty can't overcome a weak script and a tired plot and sad to say this movie has both of those things going against it. To put it into simple sports terms why watch an extra point movie when you can enjoy the original which is a six point touchdown! There's just no comparison. This one has a big red flag on the field.

Adam Sandler turns in a good performance as star quarterback Paul Crewe who has fallen from greatness to disgrace after throwing a game.  He eventually ends up in jail after a high-speed police chase.  One hilarious scene after another during the chase.  It all begins with Crewe taking his wife's car on a joy-ride without her consent.  She calls the police and reports the car as stolen.  Once pulled over, Sandler delivers one funny line after another.  One officer smells alcohol, so he asks Crewe if he's been drinking.  Obviously drunk, Crewe hands over one can of beer to the officer.  He says ""you can have that one, I have 5 more"".  He then rams into the officers' vehicle parked behind them, thus leading the officers on the high-speed chase.  He ends up in jail, where he is forced into forming a legitimate football team to play against the guards.  He eventually meets up with CARETAKER, played by Chris Rock and they start the long journey of finding jailmates willing to play against the guards.  Many funny moments occur throughout the search with all sorts of characters joining the team.  Last but not least, Coach Nate Scarborough (played by the original Burt Reynolds) joins the team as coach/player.

917821,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000A0GP0Y,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 9]","Adam Sandler is the straight man for most of this remake of ""The Longest Yard,"" starting when his character, former NFL quarterback Paul Crewe, is hauled off to prison for taking his wife's Bentley for a late night drive and finding a way to wreck a whole lot of cop cars while standing still.  If you have seen the trailer for this 2005 film then you have really seen most of Sandler's funniest bits.  However, most of the funny lines go to Chris Rock, and you are not going to be able to see them on a trailer or repeat them in polite company for that matter.  Unfortunately, Rock's character of Caretaker does not get to stand on the sidelines and make jokes during the big game because that honor goes to ESPN's Chris Berman and color man Baby Face Bob (Steve Reevis), which is too bad because Rock is a lot funnier, especially without a script.The basic situation is the same as the original.  Warden Hazen (James Cromwell) is proud of his football team made up of prison guards but insists Crewe help his team prepare for the new season.  Crewe's suggestion is for the guards to play a tune-up game against some weak opponent they can crush.  The warden loves the idea and insists Crewe put together a team of inmates to be the requisite cannon fodder.  The problem is that all the murderers, thieves and rapists in the prison do not like Crewe because he was kicked out of the NFL for point shaving.  So he has to put together a rag-tag team of misfits and psychotics until the real bad studs come out to play.  There are some bumps along the way but apparently these convicts can run around in the middle of the night all they want and eventually we get to the big game between the Guards and the Cons (a.k.a. the ""Mean Machine"").All of the best scenes in this movie come on the football field, where the goal is usually to come up with the most viscous hits ever seen in a football movie.  The two most famous bits from the original movie pop up in this one as well with only one slight variation on what we enjoyed the first time around way back in 1974.  How different are these two films?  Well, the warden's secretary was played by Bernadette Peters in the original and this time around Cloris Leachman gets to milk the role for more than it is worth.  But I can make a better case for the more important difference that while the original had to do with the quest for human dignity this one is more violence for the sake of violence.  Crewe has to remind the players that any bones the guards break are going to heal, but beating them will be something none of them will ever forget.  But since Burt Reynolds is around to play the coach (""Iron"" Mike Conrad in the original) instead of the quarterback this time around, there is an implicit stamp of approval, although my guess is Reynolds knows these guys are just making the original look even better.It is strange that MTV Films is part of the mix on this one because the familiar faces tend to be from ""Saturday Night Live"" (e.g., Tracy Morgan), ESPN (e.g., Dan Patrick, Jim Rome), and the NFL (e.g., Brian Bosworth, Bill Romanowski).  Then there is Michael Irvin who would count for both the NFL and ESPN, and Nelly, who counts record sales.  Also running around are Steve ""Stone Cold"" Austin, from the wonderful world of wrestling, and playing the role in the film I would most like to have seen cut is Nicholas Turturro, who learns there are worst things then filming a nude scene on ""N.Y.P.D. Blue.""  But for it me it was the fact that not long after I was thinking that Bob Sapp as Switowski was one of the biggest human beings I had ever seen along comes Dalip Singh as Turley to prove me wrong.  The only thing is that there are so many of these characters running around that not everybody gets to have a decent payoff while the difference between steroids and estrogen is driven into the ground.Strange to realize we live in a world where the appearance of Rob Schneider yelling, ""You can do it!"" is greeting by an audience with something akin to delight.  For me it was nice to see Ed Lauter who played Captain Knauer in the original film putting in an appearance in this one, although the cameo was bittersweet given that Eddie Albert died at the age of 99 the day this remake opened (and the obituary in the paper did not mention he was the warden in the original despite the fact everybody was impressed that the guy from ""Green Acres"" played a villain so well).  I was rather disappointed by the sports media people who play themselves and ended up rounding down on this one because the humor was not up to ""BASEketball"" standards let alone ""Major League.""  Chris Rock makes the first half of the film enjoyable and the football game delivers for the most part at the end, but in the final analysis I think that the actors had more fun remaking ""The Longest Yard"" than we had watching it.",3,"Okay, but even with Chris Rock just a patch on the original",1117238400,"05 28, 2005",2005,4869,"['Adam', 'Sandler', 'straight', 'man', 'most', 'remake', 'Longest',

917822,A19RAJY6R7USN0,B000A0GP0Y,"Lee Neville ""emotionboy""","[3, 4]","The Longest Yard tells the story of a former American Football player (Adam Sandler) who is sent to prison after a drink driving incident- don't worry no one is hurt, there's just a lot of heavy damage to several police cars. While there the Warden wants him to form a Football team among the inmates so they can challenge the prison guards in a (supposedly friendly) game. Of course, the inmates might want to inflict permanent damage rather than simply win. And trust me, these guys are tough. Slowly but surely, the former Football star assembles a team with help from Chris Rock and Burt Reynolds.This film is a comedy with a whole lotta sporting violence. This is The Waterboy on steroids and the sound effects guys are having a field day. Though being a comedy, it is not Adam Sandler that gets the most jokes, rather his so-called team does. There are also some genuine surprises, one particularly big one towards the end of the film which you wouldn't expect from this genre which makes it quite shocking. Also watch out for the obligatory Rob Schneider cameo, which though fun, seems more unnatural here than in any other Adam Sandler movies.The pacing of the movie generally holds up well, until it gets towards the end. That is where it begins to feel like a Football game. See, the thing I don't like about Football games is that the scoreboard could say there's 4 minutes left of the game, but with all the stoppages it could actually take 45 minutes. So Football games feel longwinded to me, kinda like the big football game in this movie.

I'm so used to seeing Adam Sandler playing a goof that it was quite refreshing to see him take on a quasi-serious role that pays homage to a wonderful original movie.The car chase that starts this movie was a lot of fun aside from Courtney Cox's lame performance.  Truly, I was fairly disappointed in her acting as it looked pretty canned and not convincing at all.  Her gay friend was a hoot and really should have had a bigger role.  Her only assets to the movie were her boobs hanging out of her dress but even that didn't have a big role.In your typical prison movie, this one holds no real surprises and plays very close to the original.  With the fresh, up-to-date comedy, this puts a new twist on an old classic by keeping it more in line with today's audience which is what has made this movie the beginnings of a classic and definitely one for your home collection.  The prison guards, all beefed up and talking trash, play sort of a modest role and aren't as brutal as they are in other, more violent movies.  I'm thinking the movie was leaning towards playing up the unseen but ""felt"" intimidation qualities rather that putting in a lot of unnecessary violent camera shots.  This does the movie justice and keeps the heart of the storyline intact.  Watch the original before watching this one and you'll see what I mean.Adam's performance keeps with the original story as well.  Instead of the stupid goofy roles we're used to, he does a great job of convincing the audience that, while he did something morally wrong in his former career, he's willing to make up for it in the end.  And he does with all the honesty his role could produce.  You can see he doesn't take crap from anyone at the beginning of the movie.  It was quite a surprise to me to see him being consistent with that attitude throughout the movie as most movie heros these days start out strong but weaken as the movie reels on.  He goes gloves off with the warden soon after meeting him (the first meeting went as expected) and that's where the suspense actually begins.  The ending was perfect.Burt Reynolds.  What can I say about this awesome man?  The first few lines that he says were sort of hammy but he delivers them well and plays second to a role he legendized with accuracy and perfection.  His comedy has aged perfectly and his timing is on the mark.  He's handsome, he's classic and I, for one, was very happy he chose to work in this movie.  He didn't have to as the movie could have stood on it's own and still been a great movie.  He looked like he was enjoying himself.Chris Rock had an excellent performance and excellent sidekick comedy.  I was glad to see him portray a wise-cracking, intelligent yet oddly vulnerable role that was extremely impacting when the timing was right.  He will meet up again with the Weasel and that's where his fun will truly begin.  I wish they had done something more with his character and the Weasel but suspense is a good thing, right?All questions about the characters were answered even if the answer didn't seem quite on the mark at first.  A great movie!  A must see!  And no, I'm not a fanboi.  I'm 42 and a great fan of classic movies.

917831,AAY1YLTKK4JC7,B000A0GP0Y,"Martin Andrade ""Media Gurgitator""","[10, 14]","Thanks to my numerous contacts in the media (okay, I admit, I snuck in), I was able to see a pre-screening of Adam Sandler's latest film ""The Longest Yard."" The movie is a remake of the 1974 Burt Reynold's classic of the same name. Adam Sandler plays Paul Crewe, a former NFL MVP quarterback that was accused of shaving points from a game. He is washed out of the NFL, and we catch up with him five years later at a party being hosted by his girlfriend. Crewe gets drunk, steals his girlfriend's car, and later goes on a high speed chase with police that results in his arrest.Enter James Cromwell as Warden Hazen. Hazen is a warden of a Texas prison that sports a semi-professional football team that could use the help of the NFL inmate. Hazen pulls some favors and finds himself with the star prisoner, and through the standard means forces Crewe to help out his team. Crewe suggests a practice game against a lesser opponent to sharpen the skills of the players and to get their confidence up. Warden Hazen then tells Crewe to put together a team of prisoners to take on the guards. During this Crewe befriends Caretaker, played by Chris Rock.This movie is a fast moving popcorn film that is enjoyable for its faith to the original film, and the new twists and upgrades this film makes. Sandler plays his character well, he even looks like he beefed up for the part, Chris Rock is foul mouthed as usual, but the audience begins to empathize with his character. The audience will enjoy the numerous cameos that include Chris Berman for ESPN, Bill Goldberg and Stone Cold Steve Austin of wrestling lore, and the indefatigable Burt Reynolds, who plays an aged inmate who in a former life won the Heisman trophy.It is important to note that Reynolds truly does embarass the rest of the cast with his acting ability. In a lot of ways I can't believe that I'm actually saying that, but it's true. In the first part of the film, we get used to the onscreen presence of Sandler, Rock et al. But once Reynolds walks into the film, we realize just how poor all the other actors are, despite their above par performances. If you can still suspend your disbelief with Reynolds on screen, then you will enjoy this movie.There were some downpoints to the film. James Cromwell is just not believable. There are plenty of sophomoric antics that Sandler has yet to mature from, and there is plenty of tasteless humor about prison sodomy that detracts greatly from the film. Fortunately, the film moves too quickly to dwell on such things. This movie is not art, and it is not the drama that the first incarnation was, but it's a lot more fun.",4,Good Popcorn Movie,1117152000,"05 27, 2005",2005,2629,"['Thanks', 'numerous', 'contacts', 'media', 'okay', 'admit', 'snuck', 'was', 'able', 'see', 'pre-screening', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'latest', 'film', 'Longest', 'Yard', 'movie', 'remake', '1974', 'Burt', 'Reynold', 'classic', 'same', 'name', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Paul', 'Crewe', 'former', 'NFL', 'MVP', 'quarterback', 'was', 'accused', 'shaving', 'points', 'game', 'washed', 'NFL', 'catch', 'up', 'five', 'years', 'later', 'party', 'being', 'hosted', 'girlfriend', 'Crewe', 'drunk', 'steals', 'girlfriend', 'car', 'later', 'high', 'speed', 'chase', 'police', 'results', 'arrest.Enter', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'Warden', 'Hazen', 'Hazen', 'warden', 'Texas', 'prison', 'sports', 'semi-professional', 'football', 'team', 'could', 'use', 'help', 'NFL', 'inmate', 'Hazen', 'favors', 'star', 'prisoner', 'standard', 'forces', 'Crewe', 'help', 'out', 'team', 'Crewe', 'practice', 'game', 'lesser', 'opponent', 'sharpen', 'skills', 'players', 'get', 'confidence', 'up', 'Warden', 'Hazen', 'then', 'Crewe', 'put', 'together', 'team', 'prisoners', 'take', 'guards', 'Crewe', 'Caretaker', 'played', 'Chris', 'Rock.This', 'movie', 'fast', 'moving', 'popcorn', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'faith', 'original', 'film', 'new', 'twists', 'upgrades', 'film', 'Sandler', 'character', 'well', 'even', 'beefed', 'up', 'part', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'foul', 'mouthed', 'usual', 'audience', 'empathize', 'character', 'audience', 'will', 'enjoy', 'numerous', 'cameos', 'include', 'Chris', 'Berman', 'ESPN', 'Bill', 'Goldberg', 'Stone', 'Cold', 'Steve', 'Austin', 'wrestling', 'lore', 'indefatigable', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'who', 'aged', 'inmate', 'who', 'former', 'life', 'won', 'Heisman', 'trophy.It', 'important', 'note', 'Reynolds', 'truly', 'embarass', 'rest', 'cast', 'acting', 'ability', 'lot', 'ways', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', ""'m"", 'actually', 'saying', 'true', 'first', 'part', 'film', 'get', 'used', 'onscreen', 'presence', 'Sandler', 'Rock', 'al', 'once', 'Reynolds', 'walks', 'film', 'realize', 'just', 'how', 'poor', 'other', 'actors', 'are', 'par', 'performances', 'can', 'still', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'Reynolds', 'screen', 'then', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie.There', 'were', 'downpoints', 'film', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'just', 'not', 'believable', 'are', 'plenty', 'sophomoric', 'antics', 'Sandler', 'yet', 'mature', 'plenty', 'tasteless', 'humor', 'prison', 'sodomy', 'greatly', 'film', 'Fortunately', 'film', 'moves', 'too', 'quickly', 'dwell', 'such', 'things', 'movie', 'not', 'art', 'not', 'drama', 'first', 'incarnation', 'was', 'lot', 'more', 'fun']",N/A

917833,AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ,B000A0GP0Y,"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner""","[1, 4]","As the North American box office begins to stage a recovery from its rather lethargic slump over the past few months earlier this year, though still quite far from where studio executives would desire it to be, thanks to the release of Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith last weekend, focus now shifts to comedian Chris Rock whose two films, both with entirely different demographics, lead the Memorial Day weekend. While Rock has taken quite a bit of criticism as of late due in part to his lackluster performance as host of the 77th Annual Academy Awards presentation, whether this was due to censorship limitations or his own material's inability to clash with the ceremony's key demographic is insignificant, his movie career has yet to be impacted. And should The Longest Yard and Madagascar perform significantly this weekend, even if they end up behind the last Star Wars film on the box office charts, there is no sign that it will be slowing down any time soon.The story for The Longest Yard is not of significance as soon as the game between the guards and the convicts begins and violence quickly ensures. It is all but forgotten with the audience along with a few of the players onscreen as well. How precise this inception follows its predecessor's storyline is not of concern either. This is an Adam Sandler project after all and like another remake he made a few years ago called Mr. Deeds he pays no heed to the classics as long as laughs are able to be made, no matter how lowbrow they may be. However, as Sandler has (somewhat) matured over the years so have the atmospheres of his films. In the past, films such as Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison would be nothing but comedic entertainment from beginning to end. But as was evident with Big Daddy, Sandler began developing a level of sobriety in his projects. The Longest Yard is the most extreme example of this with a heavy emphasis on violence, which in this case is not the comedic kind, and racial slurs. This is a relatively minor difficulty but one which may catch certain audience members off guard if they are not prepared for it.Adam Sandler may exhibit the eccentric personality which makes the cynical and downtrodden Paul Crewe who he is but quite noticeably he lacks the corporeal build of a former NFL quarterback, even one who has been removed from the game for several years. This abstracts from the audience's ability to perceive Sandler's character as a man who is able to bring his underdog team of convicts to victory, even to the last second of the game. This could have been passable in his other football comedy, The Waterboy, seeing as how Bobby Boucher was the underdog who was not foreseen as one who could rise above the odds, but doesn't here. Burt Reynolds on the other hand thoroughly symbolizes the physical build of a man whose fans abandoned him years ago but he has yet to either accept this fact or relegate himself to this position in life. Reynolds, who starred in the original 1974 film, The Longest Yard, on which this picture was based on, fits impeccably in the role of the gruff Coach Nate Scarborough. The only gripe against his character is that Reynolds appears rather late in the storyline and doesn't receive as much screen time as the audience would need to connect with him, although he certainly makes up for his absence in the last half hour of the picture. Surprisingly Chris Rock is not as irritating in this film as he could have been though his white/black people jokes do get old as the movie progresses. Rock's departure in the film leaves a hole in the flow of the picture which is not easily replaced, but it is so late in the film that it is hardly noticeable. And James Cromwell performs to perfection in the role of the corrupt Warden Hazen. Cromwell has had past movie experience in the role of a warden years earlier with his appearance in The Green Mile, although that was a more dramatic opportunity then this one to say the least.Tracy Morgan appeared to have dropped off the face of the planet following his abrupt departure from Saturday Night Live, which few noticed immediately seeing as how at the time he had been restricted to a skit or two per episode to begin with, and after the cancellation of his NBC television program, but his unsettling appearance in The Longest Yard demonstrates he retains the ability to scrounge up work every now and again. Did Adam Sandler, who happens to also be a Saturday Night Live alum, bale him out with a role in this film? Though Sandler has been known to do that for a number of former cast members, especially with his close friend Rob Schneider, Chris Rock may be more to blame for this one given Morgan had a role his Rock's Head of State a year ago. The further it is poured on through the film the more exasperating it becomes for the audience to tolerate without a garbage can nearby. Those with weak constitutions are given no reprieve especially when it comes to the scene Adam Sandler has with Cloris Leachman, his co-star in the James L. Brooks' film Spanglish. Leachman plays Lynette Reynolds, the Warden's secretary, who is obsessed with Crewe's underwear advertisements and forces him to engage in activities of a sexual nature in order to obtain tapes of the guards' games from past seasons. This is of course recorded via the security camera in the room and is shown to the inmates shortly thereafter, much to the chagrin of audience members. It may have been humorous on a certain level in suggestive form but outright repugnant when actually carried to a certain degree onscreen. Courteney Cox's breasts make a brief appearance in this film as those belonging to Crewe's girlfriend, Lena. This must have been while she was pregnant with her first child which actually makes her abrupt stint in The Longest Yard, a mere cameo actually, all the more discomforting. And what would an Adam Sandler film be without Rob Schneider's ""You can do it!"" which surprisingly has not gotten old after all these years.Overall, The Longest Yard fulfills the promise its advertising suggests it set out to accomplish from the beginning which was to deliver a load of cheap laughs to its audience in a senseless piece of comedic entertainment, albeit coming off a bit abrasive, mean-spirited, and even indecisively salacious in the process. This not uncommon amongst Adam Sandler pictures so this should not come as a surprise at all to his royal fan-base which undoubtedly be the backbone of this film's box office receipts. It is quite unusual to see that The Longest Yard received a PG-13 rating especially given its prominent use of vulgar language, particularly racial slurs aimed at the black community, and excessive violence which can hardly be viewed as comical in nature. This however does not necessarily go against the film considerably but it can be quite off putting for a few audience members not accustomed to this sort of behavior in their comedies. There is not a whole lot to say about this film other then the attitude one will have for it vastly depends on how you have viewed Adam Sandler and his comedies in the past. It definitely pales in comparison to his previous football picture, The Waterboy, but it's humorous enough to be recommendable for a shameless evening at the movies.",4,The Moose Hole - Sandler

The Longest Yard is one of the ones that didnt make the cut and which is utterly stupid with some funny one liners in it but otherwise its a Adam Sandler/Peter Segal failure.

The guards are real nasty to its inmates and Sandler finds that out the hard way as he fights and gets into mischief. So, Warden Cromwell tells Sandler to make a team of inmates to play football against his guards and so Sandler does so with the help of the caretaker, played by Chris Rock (Madagascar) in a throwaway role and old timer Coach, played by Burt Reynolds (Dukes Of Hazzard) who played Sandler's part in the 1974 original.

It'd be even harder to imagine a remake of the classic prison football film with Adam Sandler posing for Burt Reynolds.  Well, it became a reality, and just like you'd expect, the remake of the Longest Yard is a lame and needless remake of a classic.  Sandler plays disgraced NFLer Paul ""Wrecking"" Crewe, who finds himself in jail for quite some time.  The warden (James Cromwell) wants Crewe to assemble a team of prisoners to play his guards (led by William Fichtner) in a one-sided football game, which just so happens will be broadcast on ESPN.  Yeah, the Longest Yard is about as mainstream and product placement filled as anyone with operating brain cells can expect, and the supposedly funny and comic moments just come off as tiresome and, well, lame.  Yeah, that word has popped up a lot in this review, but I can't think of a more fitting word that suits this crud remake.  Not to mention the just plain unnecessary racist remarks to come from the guards in attempting to goad the running back (Nelly) into a fight.  The only thing that saves this crummy remake is Reynolds himself who shows up as the coach of Crewe's team, as well as a somewhat spirited performance from Chris Rock.  Not to mention that it's kind of fun to see many ex-NFLer's and greats like Michael Irvin, Bob Sapp, Bill Romanowski, and Brian Bosworth as the guards, as well as pro wrestlers like Bill Goldberg, Steve Austin, and Kevin Nash to boot.

Yes, there were moments which were faithful to the spirit of the original. Yet, there were other moments that were so ridiculously silly & unnecessary, they come close to killing the dynamic of the movie...purists and non-purists alike will likely cringe at the screen. Parts of The Longest Yard feel like a movie which happens to have Adam Sandler in it, other parts feel like a ""stereotypical"" Adam Sandler flick...I mean, for better or worse, just pick one direction and go with it!I guess the bottom line is this: if you haven't seen the original, you'll probably give this version of The Longest Yard alot more rope...but if you happen to be a fan of the original, this version is adequate but unspectacular.

Zwick,"[4, 10]","In what is fast turning out to be one of the biggest years ever for cinematic retreads (doesn`t anybody out in Hollywood have any NEW ideas anymore?), ""The Longest Yard"" is the second remake of a Robert Aldrich film to hit theaters in the past six months.  The first, ""Flight of the Phoenix,"" was released last December.  Now all we can ask is, can the ""new and improved"" version of ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?,"" starring Jane Fonda and Sissy Spacek, be far behind?.In this new edition of the `70`s hit, Adam Sandler plays Paul Crewe, an ex-quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers who was banished from the league six years earlier for allegedly shaving points off a game.  When he is arrested for stealing his girlfriend's car, Crewe is sent to a Texas prison run by a diabolical warden and his cadre of sadistic guards.  The warden, a football fan from way back, enlists Crewe's expertise in putting together a team of convicts to take on the guards in a ""friendly little game"" of intramural football.  The caveat is that this ragtag team must be good enough to make a decent show of things but not good enough to beat their opponent or there will be hell to pay.  Thus, the game becomes an inverted, high stakes encounter pitting the forces of good (the prisoners) against the forces of evil (the penal authorities).Thirty years have elapsed since I saw the original version of this film, so I don't feel particularly qualified to evaluate how this new one stacks up against the old.  I will say, however, that this ""Yard"" faces some serious problems at the get-go with the casting of Sandler in the lead role.  Burt Reynolds, who played the protagonist in the original film and who gets a fairly good-sized role in this one as well, was at least credible as a man who might have been a professional football player.  But Adam Sandler!?  Come to think of it, Sandler is probably more believable as an NFL legend than he is as a hot underwear spokes-model, an absurdity we are also asked to swallow - but the less said about that the better.There isn't much to recommend this latest edition of ""The Longest Yard.""  The plotting is predictable, the characters mere two-dimensional stereotypes and the humor obvious and lowbrow.  And the final showdown - i.e. the big game - goes on for so long that most of the tension inherent in the material simply drains away long before the closing credits.Perhaps the saddest aspect of this movie is watching Cloris Leachman making a complete and utter fool of herself playing a grotesque, beehive-coiffured sex maniac obsessed with seducing the young Mr. Crewe.

This could be a good thing because most reviews I read always stated how much the first one was better. Granted I can still compare this version to the other Adam Sandler football movie, The Waterboy. It's odd that no one complained about Sandler playing a linebacker in that movie yet everyone jumped on him for trying to be a quarterback. And he was a washed up one to boot so I really didn't have a problem with it.Of course the movie is about the washed up QB in prison but how he gets there is great with cameos by Courtney Cox's newly enormous breasts and Dan Patrick, who apparently didn't get the memo that the movie would be set in present day as he instead chose to go with the 70's gay porn mustache with a dash of the Village People. But from there Sandler is shipped off to a Texan prison where the warden pulled some strings in hope that he would help out with the prison guard's football team. And what would be better practice for the guards than a little warm up game against a team of inmates.Even though most of the inmates and guards are played by former football player, pro wrestlers and other non-actors, most of the characters are so well written, it makes up for any lack of acting experience. Ultimate Fighter Bob Sapp is great as the mentally slow Switowski, Michael Irvin in a role before he started holding onto his buddies narcotics plays a con who still doesn't trust Sandler after selling out his teammates in the NFL, and the giant Dalip Singh English was so bad they had to subtitle everything. As for the guards, Stone Cold Steve Austin, Brian Bosworth, who was always a better actor than football player, but that isn't saying much, and Bill Romanowski all play their tough guys well but I bet Romo was mad that Stone Cold got to utter the racial slurs and not him. But the standout of the guard is Kevin Nash who even though goes into every clich&eacute; conceived is hilarious after the inmates replaced his steroids with estrogen.But not all the characters are well flashed out. It's hard to relate to Nelly talking how poor his character is when he has a couple gold teeth and Goldberg one running gag that his, um, chariot swings low, so to speak, gets old before it starts. The cast is filled out with more traditional actors with Chris Rock channeling Morgan Freeman as Caretaker, Terry Crews, who has gone on to play Rock's dad on Everybody Hates Chris, is hilarious as the cheeseburger dude, as is Nicolas Turturro as the early recruit who is quickly benched as more black inmates show up.",4,I Got the Shakes That'll Make You Quake,1136678400,"01 8, 2006",2006,2726,"['have', 'start', 'off', 'review', 'saying', 'have', 'never', 'seen', '1974', 'original', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'who', 'also', 'up', 'update', 'inmates', 'coach', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'two', 'movies', 'could', 'be', 'good', 'thing', 'most', 'reviews', 'read', 'always', 'stated', 'how', 'much', 'first', 'one', 'was', 'better', 'Granted', 'can', 'still', 'compare', 'version', 'other', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'football', 'movie', 'Waterboy', 'odd', 'one', 'complained', 'Sandler', 'playing', 'linebacker', 'movie', 'yet', 'everyone', 'jumped', 'trying', 'be', 'quarterback', 'was', 'washed', 'up', 'one', 'boot', 'so', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'it.Of', 'course', 'movie', 'washed', 'up', 'QB', 'prison', 'how', 'great', 'cameos', 'Courtney', 'Cox', 'newly', 'enormous', 'breasts', 'Dan', 'Patrick', 'who', 'apparently', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'memo', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'set', 'present', 'day', 'instead', 'chose', 'go', '70', 'gay', 'porn', 'mustache', 'dash', 'Village', 'People', 'Sandler', 'shipped', 'off', 'Texan', 'prison', 'where', 'warden', 'pulled', 'strings', 'hope', 'would', 'help', 'out', 'prison', 'guard', 'football', 'team', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'practice', 'guards', 'little', 'warm', 'up', 'game', 'team', 'inmates.Even', 'most', 'inmates', 'guards', 'are', 'played', 'former', 'football', 'player', 'pro', 'wrestlers', 'other', 'non-actors', 'most', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'well', 'written', 'up', 'lack', 'acting', 'experience', 'Ultimate', 'Fighter', 'Bob', 'Sapp', 'great', 'mentally', 'slow', 'Switowski', 'Michael', 'Irvin', 'role', 'started', 'holding', 'buddies', 'narcotics', 'con', 'who', 'still', ""n't"", 'trust', 'Sandler', 'selling', 'out', 'teammates', 'NFL', 'giant', 'Dalip', 'Singh', 'English', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'had', 'subtitle', 'everything', 'guards', 'Stone', 'Cold', 'Steve', 'Austin', 'Brian', 'Bosworth', 'who', 'was', 'always', 'better', 'actor', 'football', 'player', ""n't"", 'saying', 'much', 'Bill', 'Romanowski', 'play', 'tough', 'guys', 'well', 'bet', 'Romo', 'was', 'mad', 'Stone', 'Cold', 'got', 'utter', 'racial', 'slurs', 'not', 'standout', 'guard', 'Kevin', 'Nash', 'who', 'even', 'clich', 'eacute', 'conceived', 'hilarious', 'inmates', 'replaced', 'steroids', 'estrogen.But', 'not', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'flashed', 'out', 'hard', 'relate', 'Nelly', 'talking', 'how', 'poor', 'character', 'when', 'couple', 'gold', 'teeth', 'Goldberg', 'one', 'running', 'gag', 'um', 'chariot', 'swings', 'low', 'so', 'speak', 'old', 'cast', 'filled', 'out', 'more', 'traditional', 'actors', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'channeling', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Caretaker', 'Terry', 'Crews', 'who', 'gone', 'play', 'Rock', 'dad', 'Everybody', 'Hates', 'Chris', 'hilarious', 'cheeseburger', 'dude', 'Nicolas', 'Turturro', 'early', 'recruit', 'who', 'quickly', 'benched', 'more', 'black', 'inmates', 'show', 'up']",N/A

This time around, comedian Adam Sandler replaces Reynolds in this good remake. ""The Longest Yard"" also stars Chris Rock, Nelly, James Cromwell, William Foryster, & Burt Reynolds making a return & having a significant role in the movie as well. The movie also has a great deal of former NFL players & WWE wrestlers to portray certain roles in the film such as Michael Irvin, Bob Sapp, Stone Cold Steve Austin, Kevin Nash, & Bill Goldberg among others.The movie starts out with Paul Crewe (Sandler), a former NFL MVP pro quarterback star suspended indefinitely due to shaving points off a football game, goes on a huge wrecking spree as he (while intoxicated) crashes his girlfriend's car while on a big police chase from the cops. This little wrecking spree would indeed send Crewe to Allenville Prison.While in prison, Warden Hazan (James Cromwell) asks Crewe to be the quarterback for his semi-pro guards football team to win back the championship. Crewe rejects the offer at first & would be given a hard time from the warden until Crewe agrees to do anything that the warden wants. After spending a week in the hot box, the warden gives Crewe another chance to be the quarterback for the guards, however, Crewe comes up with an idea for the guards to have a warm-up game against the inmates before the season starts with Crewe being the quarterback for the inmates. Crewe then gets Caretaker (Rock) & Nate Scarborough (Reynolds) to help him recruit the meanest, ruthless, & biggest inmates for his team.At first, the inmates only joins the team to get revenge on the guards for the hard time they recieved from the guards while doing their time in prison but as time goes on they earn the respect of each other. When it comes to game day, Crewe just plays the game for the warden but as the game goes on, Crewe realizes he wants to win not only the game but also friendship from his team of inmates. When it is all set & done, Crewe, along with his team of inmates, gets the best of the guards & Warden Hazan.""The Longest Yard"" is a very good remake in contrast to the 1974 original.

A convict, (Adam Sandler) who is former quarterback is asked to make a team of convicts to give the guards a warm-up match before their season, but end up trying to win it.

However, things get better for them when Caretaker (Chris Rock) helps him get some ""brothers"" on his team, lead by the runningback Nelly. It is a hilarious ride all the way through, with many of the jokes coming from Chris Rock. The beginning is especially funny in the scenes with Adam Sandler and the cops.

917871,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000A0GP0Y,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[5, 9]","When I told my mom I was going to go and see ""The Longest Yard"" she asked me who was in it. I mentioned Adam Sandler and Chris Rock and then mentioned that Burt Reynolds was also in it. Familiar with the 1974 original, she jokingly asked if Reynolds was going to play the `Coach' in the remake. I said I didn't think so, there was no indication of that in the trailer. After watching the film, I can report that my mother was right. She knew he would be playing the Coach because it is a clich&eacute; and ""The Longest Yard"" is filled with clich&eacute;s.Paul Crewe (Adam Sandler), an ex-quarterback in the NFL convicted of point shaving, goes on a joyride in his girlfriend's (Courtney Cox - Arquette) Bentley. Crashing into a series of police cars, he violates his probation and is sent to Allenville Penitentiary in Texas. Upon arrival, the Warden (James Cromwell) wants Crewe to help his Guard's football team prepare for the new season. The Captain of the Guard (William Fichtner) warns him against participating. He doesn't want the convicts help. Caretaker (Chris Rock) befriends Crewe, who seems to be universally disliked due to the point shaving scandal. Together, they set about forming a team to play the guards, and events quickly escalate. Nate Scarborough (Burt Reynolds), a former Heismann Trophy winner, offers to help coach the team. Soon, the game attracts the attention of the national media and the Warden, who has designs on the Texas Governor's office, plays along.Sandler's company is one of the producers of the film and Sandler is listed as an executive producer. My question is: Why? In his last few `comedies', Sandler has essentially become the straight man to other, funnier actors. In ""Mr. Deeds"", John Turturro stole the film. Granted, it wasn't difficult, but when you are a comedian, making $20 million per film, you should be funny. In ""The Longest Yard"", Sandler essentially hands the reigns to Rock, who is easily the funniest thing in the film. There are more scenes of Sandler being beaten up by prison guards, football players, basketball players, etc. than there are of any comedy.Most of Rock's laughs are generated from comments he makes about other members of their ragtag football team. The other players are your basic tried and true stereotypes, stereotypes that you will recognize from any sports - themed or prison film. Because these characters are so tired and boring, his comedy is lacking.You have: The old geezer who has seen all and knows all, the psychotic guy who can run fast, but also wants to kill everything, the big, lumbering lummox who won't talk to anyone until Crewe takes an extra moment or two to talk to him, the extremely overweight guy who just has to be on the team, if only to provide an excuse for fat jokes, the politically ambitious warden who thinks televising a game between his guards and convicts will be a good thing for his career, the guard with a `heart of gold' who eventually sees the light. There is also a group of transvestites (led by Tracy Morgan of ""Saturday Night Live"") who dress up in cheerleader's outfits for the big game. Yawn. Double yawn.If the filmmakers had managed to do anything, anything at all, original with the story or the characters, the movie would be a little more enjoyable. Let's face it, if you are going to see a sports-themed film, in all likelihood, the underdog is going to win. I can think of only two instances where this was not the case. The reason the underdog always wins? To help create suspense. But since we know the underdog will always win, how much suspense does this type of story create? Zero. What else is there? No suspense. Dumb characters. Predictable story. Hmmmm. Nothing. There is nothing else.I think the filmmakers realized this as well. During the football scenes, they seem determined to show some sort of visual style. What this means is that every time someone makes a catch or tackles someone, the action will slow down, then at the point of impact, stop, and then start moving again. Actually, this in of itself, is a clich&eacute;. We have seen this technique used in a number of films, music videos, commercials, the like. They use another technique of splitting the screen into various different images, so we can `follow the action'. This might have been interesting except more then one of these images is blurry and sort of calls into question the whole technique. Why do we need to see a blurry image when five other things are going on at the same time? We don't.The film is also filled with a number of unbelievable things. Sandler as a quarterback? At one point, Reynold's character calls Crewe a natural athlete, just before he starts playing basketball. Adam Sandler? Also, how does someone living in San Diego get sent to prison in Texas, especially when they are simply serving the remaining three years of a sentence? This doesn't seem realistic. Granted, many comedies are unrealistic in many ways, but it helps if they have some grounding in the real world. It makes the comedy more memorable if we think these situations, characters, etc. have some basis in reality. Nothing in ""The Longest Yard"" has a basis in reality.""The Longest Yard"" will probably find an audience, but hopefully it won't be any of you.",2,The Longest Yawn,1117497600,"05 31,

917872,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B000A0GP0Y,Tim Janson,"[1, 2]","Some people are complaining that the Remake of The Longest Yard is not funny enough.  But if you're familiar with the original, you know that while there was a lot of comedy, there was also an ample amount of drama as well.  In a refreshing change in a remake, Director Peter Segal who also directed Sandler in ""50 First Dates"" and ""Anger Management"" decided to stick to the spirit of the original film.  Too often directors of remakes try to put their own stamp on them and end up changing too much of the story, such as with the recent Dawn of the Dead remake.Segal basically runs the show scene for scene from the original with some cosmetic changing of characters.  Caretaker is now a black man (Chris Rock).  The role that Richard Kiel played as Sampson is now played by the behemoth black wrestler Bob Sapp as Switkoski.  The Role of the baddest cat in the joint which was Connie Shokner in the original, is now played by Giant Indian wrestler Dalip Singh as Turley.Other than these character changes, about the only other major change is that less time is devoted to Pau Crewes (Sandler) life in the joint and his interaction with the other prisoners.  The remake dispenses with that aspect and gets right into Crewe having to assemble a team of inmates to give the guards a tune-up game at the insistence of Warden Hazen (James Cromwell).Sandler probably isn't the athlete that Burt Reynolds was.  Reynolds did play college football afterall, but he pulled off his role as quarterback pretty well.  Rock is toned down a bit from his usual manic personality and Nick Turturro provides the comic relief and the butt of most of the jokes as Brucie.The film is loaded with personalities from wrestlers Stone Cold Steve Austin, Kevin Nash, and Bill Goldberg, to former NFL stars Michael Irvin and Bill Romanowski.  Throw in sports personalities Jim Rome and Chris Berman and you really have an all-star event.The actual football action was pretty well choreographed.  It's easy to spot who were the real athletes and who were the actors, though.

The first remake was the 2001 film called `Mean Machine' staring soccer player-turned-actor Vinnie Jones, and now here comes another `The Longest Yard' with Adam Sandler. Both remakes are reasonably amusing, with the original story kept basically intact, plus the reasonable supporting cast, but I still don't know why the four film companies Columbia/Paramount/MTV/Happy Madison had to remake this film now.Adam Sandler plays the role of ex-NFL player Paul Crewe, who is sent to the jail in Texas after being arrested for `stealing' his girl friend's car and his reckless driving. The warden of the prison Hazen (James Cromwell) asks - or orders - Crowe to organize a football team for the inmates. The warden's idea is, the inmates' team must be so horrible that the guards' semi-professional football team can beat them easily, feeling happy and more confident.But you know, the inmates refuse to be losers. After enlisting a help from `Caretaker' (Chris Rock) and Coach Nate Scarborough (Burt Reynolds), Paul Crowe's team named `Mean Machine' get stronger than he had expected.The director is Peter Segal, whose approach to the material is alarmingly silly at times (inmates' cheerleaders, for example), and as a result the tone of the film is at best very uneven. William Fichtner appears as sadistic prison guard, but his violence is soon forgotten in the following slapstick scenes with supports like Bob Sapp. All in all, the actors supply funny moments and the sports stunts are convincing. Chris Rock and Burt Reynolds are good, if not great, and the brief cameos from Cloris Leachman and Rob Schneider provide amusing scenes, but Sandler is least interesting, far cry from '50 First Date.'The overlong remake has little to offer except several funny scenes and amusing cameos.

Its goal is not to outdo the original, but it makes a decent, companion piece to the great and classic Burt Reynolds original. The inspired Sandler had the good sense of casting Burt Reynolds in the film in a key support role of 'Nate Scarboro'(originated by Michael Conrad-HILL STREET BLUES) and Reynolds had the good mind in accepting it because it was tailor-made for him now that its 30 years since the original was released. In an interview with Reynolds, he stated that he was apprehensive of the whole remake concept along with the fact that he created the 'Paul Crewe' character. However, he realized that the film wasn't 'Shakespeare', so why not? Robert Aldrich directed the first 'YARD' which had a familiar theme from some of his earlier films (FLIGHT OF THE PHOENIX, THE DIRTY DOZEN), showing men in dire situations rising to the occasion. Peter Segal directs the sequel with men making smart-alec remarks in comedic situations. In the original there are characters. The remake has caricatures. Also, the original worked as a dramedy, whearas the remake is more comedy. The original film had a bit more suspense with plot twists in the storyline that leads up to the big game. In the remake, the plot simply has to get from Point A to Point B. Lastly, the creators completely missed the meaning of the title of the film which is exemplified by the final play of the game. Sandler/Paul Crewe scores the winning touchdown  and the inmates (The Mean Machine) win the game.  If one watches the original version compared to the remake, one will see why the film is called THE LONGEST YARD.  If the people involved were more creative, they should have had Burt Reynolds reprise the 'Paul Crewe' character and do a sort of THE HUSTLER/COLOR OF MONEY-type sequel. Overall, a typical Adam Sandler crowd pleaser that retains most of the original film's screenplay with some added contemporary themes.
