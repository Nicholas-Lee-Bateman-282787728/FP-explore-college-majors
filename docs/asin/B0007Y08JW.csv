The shows centers itself around the friendly neighborhood Boston bar named Cheers. The bar is owned by former Boston Red Sox relief pitcher Sam Malone (Ted Danson). Sam has three employees - bartender Woody Boyd (Woody Harrelson) and waitresses Carla Tortelli (Rhea Pearlman) and Diane Chambers (Shelley Long). Noted psychiatrist Dr. Frasier Crane (Kelsey Grammar) and his wife Dr. Lilith Sternin Crane (Bebe Neuwirth) are regulars at the bar (with Grammar later starring in his own series spin-off, Frasier). Regular barflies Norm Peterson (George Wendt) and Cliff Clavin (John Ratzenberger) round out a strong supporting cast.The Cheers (Season 5) DVD offers a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere in which the audience discovers that Sam's marriage proposal from the previous year's season finale was directed at Diane. However, Diane feels that Sam is on the rebound from Janet, so she declines - requesting a more romantic setting for their engagement. When Sam proposes on a boat, Diane turns him down again then spends several episodes attempting to get Sam to propose once again. Meanwhile, Carla falls in love with Boston Bruins goalie Eddie LeBec (Jay Thomas) and John Cleese makes a guest appearance as a famous marriage counselor and friend of Frasier Crane. The season ends with Diane leaving Sam at the altar in order to finish a novel a publishing house is interested in...Below is a list of episodes included on the Cheers (Season 5) DVD:Episode 96 (The Proposal)Episode 97 (The Cape Cad)Episode 98 (Money Dearest)Episode 99 (Abnormal Psychology)Episode 100 (House of Horrors With Formal Dining and Used Brick)Episode 101 (Tan N' Wash)Episode 102 (Young Dr. Weinstein)Episode 103 (Knights of the Scimitar)Episode 104 (Thanksgiving Orphans)Episode 105 (Everyone Imitates Art)Episode 106 (The Book of Samuel)Episode 107 (Dance, Diane, Dance)Episode 108 (Chambers vs. Malone)Episode 109 (Diamond Sam)Episode 110 (Spellbound)Episode 111 (Never Love a Goalie: Part 1)Episode 112 (Never Love a Goalie: Part 2)Episode 113 (One Last Fling)Episode 114 (Dog Bites Cliff)Episode 115 (Dinner at Eight-ish)Episode 116 (Simon Says)Episode 117 (The Godfather, Part III)Episode 118 (Norm's First Hurrah)Episode 119 (Cheers: the Motion Picture)Episode 120 (A House is Not a Home)Episode 121 (I Do and Adieu)The DVD Report",5,One of the greatest sitcoms in television history...,1113782400,"04 18, 2005",2005,2506,"['One', 'greatest', 'television', 'comedies', 'history', 'Cheers', 'absolute', 'must', 'see', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'had', 'regular', 'hangout', 'where', 'everybody', 'name', 'shows', 'centers', 'friendly', 'neighborhood', 'Boston', 'bar', 'named', 'Cheers', 'bar', 'owned', 'former', 'Boston', 'Red', 'Sox', 'relief', 'pitcher', 'Sam', 'Malone', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'Sam', 'three', 'employees', 'bartender', 'Woody', 'Boyd', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Carla', 'Tortelli', 'Rhea', 'Pearlman', 'Diane', 'Chambers', 'Shelley', 'Long', 'Noted', 'psychiatrist', 'Dr.', 'Frasier', 'Crane', 'Kelsey', 'Grammar', 'wife', 'Dr.', 'Lilith', 'Sternin', 'Crane', 'Bebe', 'Neuwirth', 'are', 'regulars', 'bar', 'Grammar', 'later', 'starring', 'own', 'series', 'spin-off', 'Frasier', 'Regular', 'barflies', 'Norm', 'Peterson', 'George', 'Wendt', 'Cliff', 'Clavin', 'John', 'Ratzenberger', 'round', 'out', 'strong', 'supporting', 'cast.The', 'Cheers', 'Season', '5', 'DVD', 'number', 'hilarious', 'episodes', 'including', 'season', 'premiere', 'audience', 'discovers', 'Sam', 'marriage', 'proposal', 'previous', 'year', 'season', 'finale', 'was', 'directed', 'Diane', 'However', 'Diane', 'Sam', 'rebound', 'Janet', 'requesting', 'more', 'romantic', 'setting', 'engagement', 'When', 'Sam', 'boat', 'Diane', 'down', 'again', 'then', 'several', 'episodes', 'attempting', 'get', 'Sam', 'propose', 'once', 'again', 'Meanwhile', 'Carla', 'love', 'Boston', 'Bruins', 'goalie', 'Eddie', 'LeBec', 'Jay', 'Thomas', 'John', 'Cleese', 'guest', 'appearance', 'famous', 'marriage', 'counselor', 'friend', 'Frasier', 'Crane', 'season', 'Diane', 'leaving', 'Sam', 'altar', 'order', 'finish', 'novel', 'publishing', 'house', 'interested', 'Below', 'list', 'episodes', 'included', 'Cheers', 'Season', '5', 'DVD', 'Episode', '96', 'Proposal', 'Episode', '97', 'Cape', 'Cad', 'Episode', '98', 'Money', 'Dearest', 'Episode', '99', 'Abnormal', 'Psychology', 'Episode', '100', 'House', 'Horrors', 'Formal', 'Dining', 'Used', 'Brick', 'Episode', '101', 'Tan', 'N', 'Wash', 'Episode', '102', 'Young', 'Dr.', 'Weinstein', 'Episode', '103', 'Knights', 'Scimitar', 'Episode', '104', 'Thanksgiving', 'Orphans', 'Episode', '105', 'Everyone', 'Imitates', 'Art', 'Episode', '106', 'Book', 'Samuel', 'Episode', '107', 'Dance', 'Diane', 'Dance', 'Episode', '108', 'Chambers', 'vs.', 'Malone', 'Episode', '109', 'Diamond', 'Sam', 'Episode', '110', 'Spellbound', 'Episode', '111', 'Never', 'Love', 'Goalie', 'Part', '1', 'Episode', '112', 'Never', 'Love', 'Goalie', 'Part', '2', 'Episode', '113', 'One', 'Last', 'Fling', 'Episode', '114', 'Dog', 'Bites', 'Cliff', 'Episode', '115', 'Dinner', 'Eight-ish', 'Episode', '116', 'Simon', 'Says', 'Episode', '117', 'Godfather', 'Part', 'III', 'Episode', '118', 'Norm', 'First', 'Hurrah', 'Episode', '119', 'Cheers', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'Episode', '120', 'House', 'Not', 'Home', 'Episode', '121', 'Do', 'Adieu', 'DVD', 'Report']",Cheers: Season 5

894394,A3A4WQL80WOTMH,B0007Y08JW,Green Manalishi,"[0, 0]","It's hard to decided on a star rating for this season.  In terms of hilarity, I found Seasons 3 and 4 funnier - and those were utterly hilarious seasons.  Season 5 is imperitive though for anyone following the Sam and Diane romance as it ties up ends that had been in the making for a long time (namely the prior 4 seasons) so it will be essential to anyone following the series.  While this season is funny and entertaining without a doubt, it doesn't score as high in laughs as previous seasons, and one reason for that is the preoccupation with Sam and Diane's impending marriage. However, while this season perhaps did not quite meet previous season levels of gut laughs, there are many moments of real thought provoking drama, proving again that while Cheers was a comedy, it was also a show of some depth in the issues that it non-chalantly tackled.  Perhaps it was the right time for Shelley Long to leave the show, but seeing her leave in that final episode was somewhat like saying a last goodbye to an old friend.  Diane as a character was obviously not without her faults, but in spite of those, she brought in concepts of higher education, literature, poetry, the arts - AND vanity, snobbery, and pretentiousness - how much more fodder could a character bring to a show?In previous seasons Diane often vasicilated between sexy and cute and vain and high-brow, but in this season she truly reaches an apex of exasperating self-centeredness that will leave the viewer almost crying out at more than one of her stunts!  She usually manages to relent at last, or is it Sam's easy-going nature that brings things back into the realm of stomachability.  I'd not like this season alone to stand as full representation for her character.  But even so, I found that at the end of the season, she'd more or less won me over again - well, I wouldn't want to marry her ;) - but to tell you the truth, it seemed to me that finally Sam stopped the wedding.  You'll have to judge for yourself.  In reality, Long had decided already that season 5 would be her last even though producers had offered her ridiculously high amounts of money for her to continue.  Whether it was for spending more time with her kids, or to pursue a movie career, Long left after this season.  I've yet to go back through the Rebecca shows on DVD and am looking forward to it, but as I grew up with the Diane era myself, these first 5 seasons are more or less gold for me.  All of the characters in this show are unique and form an incredibly varied yet cohesive unit.  I'd give this season 4.5 stars in terms of humour.

894398,A2XAGLR8VDOU6T,B0007Y08JW,"Joshua Spaulding ""Television God""","[18, 18]","While Cheers continued on for another six seasons after this fifth season, for many fans of the show, it ended when Shelley Long's character Diane Chambers walked out of the Boston bar for the final time as Ted Danson's Sam Malone watched her leave, knowing she would never come back.The chemistry between Sam and Diane is what really drove this comedy for the first five seasons that it was on the air. The two actors were truly in sync and their back and forth banter and will they or won't they romance that was on and off countless times during the five years, was something that has not been captured on television many times since.While Long left the show, as I mentioned, the show continued on for another six years, with Kirstie Alley essentially taking over for Long. While Alley's Rebecca Howe and Sam had good chemistry, it was tough to live up to what had come before with Sam and Diane.Season four ended with Sam proposing to Diane and we pick up in season five as she rejects him, then quickly changes her mind. Of course, once he was rejected, Sam decided it was over and didn't want to take her back until midway through the season when they finally officially got proposed, while Sam was in court after Diane brought him there on assault charges. As the season drew to a close, the marriage was still planned, but Sam knew better as he said his goodbyes as the door closed behind her for the last time as a cast regular.While this season marked the final regular cast appearance by Long, it was the first season as a regular cast member for Kelsey Grammer as Dr. Frasier Crane. Dr. Crane was a recurring character for most of the previous seasons, but it was this year that his name came in the opening credits. In this season he becomes serious with the woman who would eventually become his ex-wife, Dr. Lilith Sternin, portrayed absolutely fabulously by the great Bebe Neuwirth. The two move in together and a dinner with Sam and Diane brings out some former relationship secrets that Frasier never shared with his new love.Bar employees Cara Tortelli and Woody Boyd (Rhea Perlman and Woody Harrelson) continue to make life in Cheers enjoyable for everyone with their great humor. While Perlman's humor is more on the cynical, biting side, Harrelson comes across as the innocent youngster who just never seems to say the right thing. A highlight episode in this season was the famous ""Thanksgiving Orphans"" episode, where the Cheers gang gathers at Carla's for Turkey Day and the evening ends with a massive food fight. This was one of the best episodes of the season, and quite possibly of the series, at least in my mind.Bar flies Cliff Clavin and Norm Peterson (John Ratzenberger and George Wendt) seem to live in Cheers, but in this season you get  a glimpse of their lives outside of the bar. Mailman Cliff falls for a woman whose dog bit him and she uses his feelings to help get the lawsuit dropped. Norm gets a new job with an accounting firm and everyone gets a glimpse into his life as they take a look at his new ""office"". Also, for the first time, we get to see Norm's wife Vera, but she is obscured a little. In the Thanksgiving Orphans episode, she shows up at Carla's and immediately gets hit in the face with a pie, so viewers still have no idea just what Vera is like.The only bad thing about this set is the same as with the fourth season. The set has absolutely no extras, which is disappointing, as it would have been great to hear what things were like behind the scenes in Long's last year. But beyond that, this season set featured a lot of great episodes.As a youngster, I enjoyed the final few seasons of Cheers, but I never realized just how fantastic this show was with Shelley Long and Ted Danson's chemistry in the early years. As far as this show goes, this season was certainly a great one, but at the same time, a tough one as the hole left by Long was a big one.",4,"Au revoir, Miss Chambers",1124064000,"08 15, 2005",2005,3915,"['Cheers', 'continued', 'six', 'seasons', 'fifth', 'season', 'many', 'fans', 'show', 'ended', 'when', 'Shelley', 'Long', 'character', 'Diane', 'Chambers', 'walked', 'Boston', 'bar', 'final', 'time', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'Sam', 'Malone', 'watched', 'leave', 'knowing', 'would', 'never', 'come', 'back.The', 'chemistry', 'Sam', 'Diane', 'what', 'really', 'drove', 'comedy', 'first', 'five', 'seasons', 'was', 'air', 'two', 'actors', 'were', 'truly', 'sync', 'back', 'forth', 'banter', 'will', 'wo', ""n't"", 'romance', 'was', 'countless', 'times', 'five', 'years', 'was', 'something', 'not', 'been', 'captured', 'television', 'many', 'times', 'since.While', 'Long', 'left', 'show', 'mentioned', 'show', 'continued', 'six', 'years', 'Kirstie', 'Alley', 'essentially', 'taking', 'over', 'Long', 'Alley', 'Rebecca', 'Howe', 'Sam', 'had', 'good', 'chemistry', 'was', 'tough', 'live', 'up', 'what', 'had', 'come', 'Sam', 'Diane.Season', 'four', 'ended', 'Sam', 'proposing', 'Diane', 'pick', 'up', 'season', 'five', 'then', 'quickly', 'mind', 'course', 'once', 'was', 'rejected', 'Sam', 'decided', 'was', 'over', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'take', 'back', 'midway', 'season', 'when', 'finally', 'officially', 'got', 'proposed', 'Sam', 'was', 'court', 'Diane', 'brought', 'there', 'assault', 'charges', 'season', 'drew', 'close', 'marriage', 'was', 'still', 'planned', 'Sam', 'knew', 'better', 'said', 'goodbyes', 'door', 'closed', 'last', 'time', 'cast', 'regular.While', 'season', 'marked', 'final', 'regular', 'cast', 'appearance', 'Long', 'was', 'first', 'season', 'regular', 'cast', 'member', 'Kelsey', 'Grammer', 'Dr.', 'Frasier', 'Crane', 'Dr.', 'Crane', 'was', 'recurring', 'character', 'most', 'previous', 'seasons', 'was', 'year', 'name', 'came', 'opening', 'credits', 'season', 'serious', 'woman', 'who', 'would', 'eventually', 'become', 'ex-wife', 'Dr.', 'Lilith', 'Sternin', 'portrayed', 'absolutely', 'fabulously', 'great', 'Bebe', 'Neuwirth', 'two', 'move', 'together', 'dinner', 'Sam', 'Diane', 'out', 'former', 'relationship', 'secrets', 'Frasier', 'never', 'shared', 'new', 'love.Bar', 'employees', 'Cara', 'Tortelli', 'Woody', 'Boyd', 'Rhea', 'Perlman', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'continue', 'make', 'life', 'Cheers', 'enjoyable', 'everyone', 'great', 'humor', 'Perlman', 'humor', 'more', 'cynical', 'biting', 'side', 'Harrelson', 'innocent', 'youngster', 'who', 'just', 'never', 'say', 'right', 'thing', 'highlight', 'episode', 'season', 'was', 'famous', 'Thanksgiving', 'Orphans', 'episode', 'where', 'Cheers', 'gang', 'gathers', 'Carla', 'Turkey', 'Day', 'evening', 'massive', 'food', 'fight', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'episodes', 'season', 'quite', 'possibly', 'series', 'least', 'mind.Bar', 'flies', 'Cliff', 'Clavin', 'Norm', 'Peterson', 'John', 'Ratzenberger', 'George', 'Wendt', 'seem', 'live', 'Cheers', 'season', 'get', 'glimpse', 'lives', 'bar', 'Mailman', 'Cliff', 'woman', 'dog', 'bit', 'feelings', 'help', 'get', 'lawsuit', 'dropped', 'Norm', 'new', 'job', 'accounting', 'firm', 'everyone', 'glimpse', 'life', 'take', 'look', 'new', 'office', 'Also', 'first', 'time', 'get', 'see', 'Norm', 'wife', 'Vera', 'obscured', 'little', 'Thanksgiving', 'Orphans', 'episode', 'up', 'Carla', 'immediately', 'hit', 'face', 'pie', 'viewers', 'still', 'have', 'idea', 'just', 'what', 'Vera', 'like.The', 'only', 'bad', 'thing', 'set', 'same', 'fourth', 'season', 'set', 'absolutely', 'extras', 'disappointing', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'hear', 'what', 'things', 'were', 'scenes', 'Long', 'last', 'year', 'season', 'set', 'featured', 'lot', 'great', 'episodes.As', 'youngster', 'enjoyed', 'final', 'few', 'seasons', 'Cheers', 'never', 'realized', 'just', 'how', 'fantastic', 'show', 'was', 'Shelley', 'Long', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'chemistry', 'early', 'years', 'As', 'far', 'show', 'season', 'was', 'certainly', 'great', 'one', 'same', 'time', 'tough', 'one', 'hole', 'left', 'Long', 'was', 'big', 'one']",Cheers: Season 5

The sparring Love Hate relationship she shared with sam was unparralled.  They were recently voted #6 in the TV Land Countdown for Best TV Couple!!  I think they should have at least made the top 3  :)Although it was sad to see Diane leave ,, Kirsty Alley did a wonderful job filling the void ..creating a different chemistry with the show !However, I must note .. a few reviews said that Diane's last appearence was in Season 5 ..this is not true !!  For all of you fans ... she does reappear in the Series 3 Part Finale in Season 11.Here is a little list of the last 3 episodes .. featuring Diane.Episode # 273 - ""One for the Road, Part I""The gang sees Diane winning a Cable ACE award on TV. Sam calls Diane and invites her to Cheers. Don asks Rebecca to marry him, but she can't say yes.Episode # 274 - ""One for the Road, Part II""Rebecca poses as Sam's wife for a double date with Diane and her husband, Reed. Don interrupts the date and asks Rebecca to marry him. She says yes. Reed admits he is not married to Diane. Sam and Diane decide to get married.Episode # 275 - ""One for the Road, Part III (Series Finale)""Sam announces he is leaving Cheers to start a new life in California with Diane, but at the airport, they decide not to marry. Sam returns to Cheers.~*~* In short this is a CLASSIC TV show with excellent writing paired with a Great Cast that had on air chemistry. It will no doubt stand the test of TV Time and be around 50 years from now .. as ancestor shows like I love Lucy and The Honeymooners. ~*~** These 2 shows are merely mentioned to give examples of TV shows that are still around 50 years later ..as I suspect Cheers will be !",5,~*~*  Sam and Diane Voted #6 in TV Land Countdown ~*~*,1118361600,"06 10, 2005",2005,1733,"['~*', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'Seasons', '1-5', 'loved', 'character', 'Diane', 'Chambers', 'sparring', 'Love', 'Hate', 'relationship', 'shared', 'sam', 'was', 'unparralled', 'were', 'recently', 'voted', '6', 'TV', 'Land', 'Countdown', 'Best', 'TV', 'Couple', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'least', 'made', 'top', '3', 'was', 'sad', 'see', 'Diane', 'leave', 'Kirsty', 'Alley', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'filling', 'void', '..creating', 'different', 'chemistry', 'show', 'However', 'must', 'note', 'few', 'reviews', 'said', 'Diane', 'last', 'appearence', 'was', 'Season', '5', '..this', 'not', 'true', 'fans', 'reappear', 'Series', '3', 'Part', 'Finale', 'Season', '11.Here', 'little', 'list', 'last', '3', 'episodes', '..', 'featuring', 'Diane.Episode', '273', 'One', 'Road', 'Part', 'gang', 'Diane', 'winning', 'Cable', 'ACE', 'award', 'TV', 'Sam', 'Diane', 'Cheers', 'Don', 'Rebecca', 'marry', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'yes.Episode', '274', 'One', 'Road', 'Part', 'II', 'Rebecca', 'Sam', 'wife', 'double', 'date', 'Diane', 'husband', 'Reed', 'Don', 'date', 'Rebecca', 'marry', 'yes', 'Reed', 'admits', 'not', 'married', 'Diane', 'Sam', 'Diane', 'decide', 'get', 'married.Episode', '275', 'One', 'Road', 'Part', 'III', 'Series', 'Finale', 'Sam', 'announces', 'leaving', 'Cheers', 'start', 'new', 'life', 'California', 'Diane', 'airport', 'decide', 'not', 'marry', 'Sam', 'Cheers.~*~*', 'short', 'CLASSIC', 'TV', 'show', 'excellent', 'writing', 'paired', 'Great', 'Cast', 'had', 'air', 'chemistry', 'will', 'no', 'doubt', 'stand', 'test', 'TV', 'Time', 'be', '50', 'years', 'now', 'ancestor', 'shows', 'love', 'Lucy', 'Honeymooners', '~*~**', '2', 'shows', 'are', 'merely', 'mentioned', 'give', 'examples', 'TV', 'shows', 'are', 'still', '50', 'years', 'later', '..as', 'suspect', 'Cheers', 'will', 'be']",Cheers: Season 5

While other shows like Seinfeld continue to be ratings juggernauts in re-runs, Cheers has lost a bit of that lustre and I'm not really sure why.  With great writing and great performances Cheers always delivered the laughs and the ratings.  This show finished in the Nielsen Top 10 eight times including SEVEN top 5 finishes.  That's really incredible.  Season five was notable for one big event which was Shelly Long leaving the show in the last episode of the season, paving the way for Kirstie Alley in Season six.  Season Five would begin with dueling wedding proposals between Sam and Diane and end with the pair finally set to marry until Diane gets a book offer.Favorite season five episodes include:1) The proposal - Sam finally proposes to Diane romantically aboard a boat.  When Diane turns him down Sam makes her walk the plank.2) Thanksgiving orphans - One of the all-time great Cheers episodes as the gang gathers at Carla's house for Thanksgiving Dinner that takes all night to cook and ends up in a hilarious food fight featuring the only appearance of Norm's wife Vera as she is totally covered in food.3) Everyone Imitates art.  Sam gets a poem published in a magazine that has rejected Diane's work a number of times and she is sure that he stole the poem from somewhere and is determined to find out.4) Never Love a Goalie - Carla starts dating a Pro hockey goalie named Eddie (Jay Thomas) but as soon as they start dating, Eddie starts playing terribly.5) Dinner at Eight-ish.  Frasier and Lilith invite Sam and Diane over for dinner but things go awry when Lilith finds out that Frasier  and Diane used to date.6) Norm's First Hurrah.  Norm brags about getting a great job as an accountant with a top company but when the gang surprises him at work, things are not exactly as norm described.7) Simon Says - The Great John Cleese plays a noted marriage Counselor who says Sam and Diane are not meant for each other which so upsets Diane that she continues to pester him.  Hilarious episode!8)  I do and Adieu - Diane's leaves Sam when they are finally ready to be married.To be honest I always preferred Kirstie Alley over Shelly long so I was not all that upset to see Diane leave.  But there are lots of great episodes in this season that would lead into the final six season which I truly loved.",5,ONE OF TV'S ALL-TIME GREATS,1116201600,"05 16, 2005",2005,2431,"['Cheers', 'was', 'one', 'great', 'time', 'sit-coms', 'unfortunately', 'have', 'not', 'aged', 'very', 'well', 'viewers', 'other', 'shows', 'Seinfeld', 'continue', 'be', 'ratings', 'juggernauts', 're-runs', 'Cheers', 'lost', 'bit', 'lustre', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'why', 'great', 'writing', 'great', 'performances', 'Cheers', 'always', 'delivered', 'laughs', 'ratings', 'show', 'finished', 'Nielsen', 'Top', '10', 'eight', 'times', 'including', 'SEVEN', 'top', '5', 'finishes', 'really', 'incredible', 'Season', 'five', 'was', 'notable', 'one', 'big', 'event', 'was', 'Shelly', 'Long', 'leaving', 'show', 'last', 'episode', 'season', 'paving', 'way', 'Kirstie', 'Alley', 'Season', 'six', 'Season', 'Five', 'would', 'begin', 'dueling', 'wedding', 'proposals', 'Sam', 'Diane', 'end', 'pair', 'finally', 'set', 'marry', 'Diane', 'book', 'offer.Favorite', 'season', 'five', 'episodes', 'include:1', 'proposal', 'Sam', 'finally', 'Diane', 'romantically', 'boat', 'When', 'Diane', 'down', 'Sam', 'walk', 'plank.2', 'Thanksgiving', 'orphans', 'One', 'all-time', 'great', 'Cheers', 'episodes', 'gang', 'gathers', 'Carla', 'house', 'Thanksgiving', 'Dinner', 'night', 'cook', 'up', 'hilarious', 'food', 'fight', 'featuring', 'only', 'appearance', 'Norm', 'wife', 'Vera', 'totally', 'covered', 'food.3', 'Everyone', 'art', 'Sam', 'poem', 'published', 'magazine', 'rejected', 'Diane', 'work', 'number', 'times', 'sure', 'stole', 'poem', 'somewhere', 'determined', 'find', 'out.4', 'Never', 'Love', 'Goalie', 'Carla', 'dating', 'Pro', 'hockey', 'goalie', 'named', 'Eddie', 'Jay', 'Thomas', 'as', 'soon', 'start', 'dating', 'Eddie', 'playing', 'terribly.5', 'Dinner', 'Eight-ish', 'Frasier', 'Lilith', 'invite', 'Sam', 'Diane', 'dinner', 'things', 'go', 'awry', 'when', 'Lilith', 'out', 'Frasier', 'Diane', 'used', 'date.6', 'Norm', 'First', 'Hurrah', 'Norm', 'getting', 'great', 'job', 'accountant', 'top', 'company', 'when', 'gang', 'work', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'exactly', 'norm', 'described.7', 'Simon', 'Says', 'Great', 'John', 'Cleese', 'noted', 'marriage', 'Counselor', 'who', 'Sam', 'Diane', 'are', 'not', 'meant', 'other', 'so', 'Diane', 'pester', 'Hilarious', 'episode', '8', 'do', 'Adieu', 'Diane', 'leaves', 'Sam', 'when', 'are', 'finally', 'ready', 'be', 'married.To', 'be', 'honest', 'always', 'preferred', 'Kirstie', 'Alley', 'Shelly', 'long', 'so', 'was', 'not', 'upset', 'see', 'Diane', 'leave', 'are', 'lots', 'great', 'episodes', 'season', 'would', 'lead', 'final', 'six', 'season', 'truly', 'loved']",Cheers: Season 5
