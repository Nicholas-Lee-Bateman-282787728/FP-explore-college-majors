The Andes plane crash definitely fits the bill, and has the added drawing power of the terrible but necessary choices the survivors had to make. I was very pleased to see that this documentary was unbiased - often I find that these types of documentaries are based on one or two accounts, and often are heavily biased due to this fact (some of the accounts of Everest's tragedies, for example).I much enjoyed the background on the people involved, and the thorough recreation of the events that led to the crash. I was very pleased to see that the makers of the film dealt with the human error involved in the crash tastefully - they showed testimony that the pilot(s) were at fault, however did not dwell on the subject. I was also pleased to see that they showed the names of each victim after each event (crash/avalanche etc.) - I found that to be very respectful and appropriate.Aside from reading one of the (several) books available on the subject, this is about the best explanation and investigation into this incident that you will be able to find. As another reviewer mentioned, the DVD includes several bonus features including interviews that were/are not included during broadcast, a short featurette and a slideshow of original photos. This DVD is rated as ""PG"" (due to no graphic content or swearing), however I would strongly advise parents to use caution - cannibalism is gruesome enough without adding the emotional trauma and guilt these people went through...Overall, this is an excellent documentary that shows the extraordinary strength of the human spirit - well worth adding to your documentary collection!",5,"Unbiased, powerful.",1352678400,"11 12, 2012",2012,1704,"['have', 'always', 'been', 'intrigued', 'tales', 'survival', 'courage', 'strength', 'Andes', 'plane', 'crash', 'definitely', 'bill', 'added', 'drawing', 'power', 'terrible', 'necessary', 'choices', 'survivors', 'had', 'make', 'was', 'very', 'pleased', 'see', 'documentary', 'was', 'unbiased', 'often', 'find', 'types', 'documentaries', 'are', 'based', 'one', 'two', 'accounts', 'often', 'are', 'heavily', 'biased', 'due', 'fact', 'accounts', 'Everest', 'tragedies', 'example', '.I', 'much', 'background', 'people', 'involved', 'thorough', 'recreation', 'events', 'led', 'crash', 'was', 'very', 'pleased', 'see', 'makers', 'film', 'dealt', 'human', 'error', 'involved', 'crash', 'tastefully', 'showed', 'testimony', 'pilot', 'were', 'fault', 'however', 'did', 'not', 'dwell', 'subject', 'was', 'also', 'pleased', 'see', 'showed', 'names', 'victim', 'event', 'crash/avalanche', 'etc', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'respectful', 'appropriate.Aside', 'reading', 'one', 'several', 'books', 'available', 'subject', 'best', 'explanation', 'investigation', 'incident', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'find', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'DVD', 'several', 'bonus', 'features', 'including', 'interviews', 'were/are', 'not', 'included', 'broadcast', 'short', 'featurette', 'slideshow', 'original', 'photos', 'DVD', 'rated', 'PG', 'due', 'graphic', 'content', 'swearing', 'however', 'would', 'strongly', 'advise', 'parents', 'use', 'caution', 'cannibalism', 'gruesome', 'enough', 'adding', 'emotional', 'trauma', 'guilt', 'people', 'went', 'Overall', 'excellent', 'documentary', 'extraordinary', 'strength', 'human', 'spirit', 'well', 'adding', 'documentary', 'collection']",N/A

Koch ""Beth""","[35, 35]","I watched this documentary when it first aired a few months ago on the History Channel, and decided right then to buy the DVD. I'm fascinated by survival stories and I've always been particularly interested in this one. I remember vividly when it happened and was being reported in the news, I've read the book ""Alive"" (more than once), Nando Parrado's book ""Miracle in the Andes"", and also enjoyed the film that came out in the 90's. This documentary is mainly narrated by Parrado (who with Roberto Canessa was the hero of this event) and his heartfelt memories and emotions are extremely moving, and come through loud and clear because he lived it, and that is something that a professional narrator could never convey. Very interesting sequences show expeditions back to the site of the crash so you can see how things look today, and then follow the escape route, showing exactly what Parrado and Canessa were up against. The photography is beautiful and enhanced by interviews with experts in various fields throughout, to provide technical information about survival, technical mountaineering challenges, etc., emphasizing just how difficult things were for these boys. The DVD has some bonus features which weren't aired on TV which are great, including additional interviews, artifacts from the crash site, etc. If you're interested in survival stories and in particular this one, you can't go wrong with this DVD.",5,"A moving follow-up to the ""Alive"" story",1304208000,"05 1, 2011",2011,1422,"['watched', 'documentary', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'few', 'months', 'ago', 'History', 'Channel', 'decided', 'right', 'then', 'buy', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'fascinated', 'survival', 'stories', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'particularly', 'interested', 'one', 'remember', 'vividly', 'when', 'happened', 'was', 'being', 'reported', 'news', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'Alive', 'more', 'once', 'Nando', 'Parrado', 'book', 'Miracle', 'Andes', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'came', 'out', '90', 'documentary', 'mainly', 'narrated', 'Parrado', 'who', 'Roberto', 'Canessa', 'was', 'hero', 'event', 'heartfelt', 'memories', 'emotions', 'are', 'extremely', 'moving', 'come', 'loud', 'clear', 'lived', 'something', 'professional', 'narrator', 'could', 'never', 'convey', 'Very', 'interesting', 'sequences', 'show', 'expeditions', 'back', 'site', 'crash', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'things', 'look', 'today', 'then', 'follow', 'escape', 'route', 'showing', 'exactly', 'what', 'Parrado', 'Canessa', 'were', 'up', 'photography', 'beautiful', 'enhanced', 'interviews', 'experts', 'various', 'fields', 'provide', 'technical', 'information', 'survival', 'technical', 'mountaineering', 'challenges', 'etc.', 'emphasizing', 'just', 'how', 'difficult', 'things', 'were', 'boys', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'features', 'were', ""n't"", 'aired', 'TV', 'are', 'great', 'including', 'additional', 'interviews', 'artifacts', 'crash', 'site', 'etc', ""'re"", 'interested', 'survival', 'stories', 'particular', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'DVD']",N/A
1389357,A29966ZBLX044D,B0049AF6VA,"K. Pierce ""Optimistic""","[7, 8]","I watched this film after reading the book ""Miracle in the Andes"", written by Nando Parrado, one of the rugby players who survived the crash of the plane in 1972.  I remembered the news back then when they reported the crash of the plane, and that there were survivors, but I never really knew the details of how they were found.  The story is so unbelievable that I'm really haunted by it.  In short, I recommend that people read the book first, then watch the film, because after reading the harrowing story you will become even more blown away when you watch the film and see the unbelievable obstacles faced by these boys who were so determined to live that they absolutely performed miracles.  Parrado is an amazingly humble man considering what he accomplished, and he'll become your hero.

The documentary is very well made and the filmmakers go back to the site and are able to fill in the gaps that the books on the incident have.  They are able to point out the place where the airplane hit the mountain ridge, the path of the fuselage down the mountain and they trace the harrowing 10 day climb and trek that Canessa and Parrado undertake which ends up in saving the lives of the other 14 survivors.  Good interviews with some of the survivors and a study of artifacts from the incident, which are apparently eventually fated for a museum exhibit in Uruguay dedicated to this epic survival story.",5,outstanding,1372723200,"07 2, 2013",2013,735,"[""'re"", 'history', 'buff', 'Uruguayan', 'rugby', 'team', 'survival', 'Andes', 'Mountains', '1972', 'need', 'get', 'DVD', 'documentary', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'filmmakers', 'go', 'back', 'site', 'are', 'able', 'fill', 'gaps', 'books', 'incident', 'have', 'are', 'able', 'point', 'out', 'place', 'where', 'airplane', 'hit', 'mountain', 'ridge', 'path', 'fuselage', 'down', 'mountain', 'trace', 'harrowing', '10', 'day', 'climb', 'trek', 'Canessa', 'Parrado', 'undertake', 'up', 'saving', 'lives', 'other', '14', 'survivors', 'Good', 'interviews', 'survivors', 'study', 'artifacts', 'incident', 'are', 'apparently', 'eventually', 'fated', 'museum', 'exhibit', 'Uruguay', 'dedicated', 'epic', 'survival', 'story']",N/A
