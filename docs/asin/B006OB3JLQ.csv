1517893,AAZRWLML88IZK,B006OB3JLQ,A kids review,"[3, 9]","After spending years in front of the camera as one of the most sought after A-list actresses, Angelina Jolie decided to take a shot at operating behind it, making her writing and directing debut with In the Land of Blood and Honey. Set in Bosnian War-era Sarajevo, Blood and Honey is a dark, disturbing story of star crossed love between a Serbian soldier and his former flame, a Muslim woman now forced into sexual slavery in the camp he oversees. Jolie drew upon her experiences as UN ambassador for inspiration, and I am willing to acknowledge her ambition in the project, even if parts of the story were stretched too thin, the film marked a confidant debut for her. Filmed overseas with local actors from the surrounding regions, it's not the glamorous Hollywood fare normally associated with Jolie's acting roles, but it's an intriguing film, if only to see what potential Jolie might possess as a filmmaker.",3,In the Land of Blood and Honey,1332806400,"03 27, 2012",2012,914,"['spending', 'years', 'front', 'camera', 'one', 'most', 'sought', 'A-list', 'actresses', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'decided', 'take', 'shot', 'operating', 'making', 'writing', 'directing', 'debut', 'Land', 'Blood', 'Honey', 'Set', 'Bosnian', 'War-era', 'Sarajevo', 'Blood', 'Honey', 'dark', 'disturbing', 'story', 'star', 'crossed', 'love', 'Serbian', 'soldier', 'former', 'flame', 'Muslim', 'woman', 'now', 'forced', 'sexual', 'slavery', 'camp', 'Jolie', 'drew', 'experiences', 'UN', 'ambassador', 'inspiration', 'am', 'willing', 'acknowledge', 'ambition', 'project', 'even', 'parts', 'story', 'were', 'stretched', 'too', 'thin', 'film', 'marked', 'confidant', 'debut', 'Filmed', 'overseas', 'local', 'actors', 'surrounding', 'regions', 'not', 'glamorous', 'Hollywood', 'fare', 'normally', 'associated', 'Jolie', 'acting', 'roles', 'intriguing', 'film', 'only', 'see', 'what', 'potential', 'Jolie', 'might', 'possess', 'filmmaker']",In the Land of Blood and Honey
1517894,A2809U2S14N0K1,B006OB3JLQ,BernardZ,"[2, 2]","I did like the movie. It is a conflict that I know much about so I could relate to it. History was not kind to this region. The Bosnian Muslims and Serbs had lived together for centuries. Recently under Tito for many years under a forced peace. When Tito died, the Serbs, firstly, tried to keep Yugoslavia together when that failed tried to secure themselves the biggest part. Not that everyone else was that innocent either in this grab for power.Suddenly, the Bosnian Muslims were remembered not as neighbors and friends but as richer landlords almost 100 years ago. More importantly during ww2 while the Serbs suffered extremely badly from the Nazis, the Bosnian Muslims were remembered as Nazi allies as many of them had in WW2 aligned with the Nazis. They were seen as enemies of the Serbs even though many had aligned with the anti Nazis. Suddenly young people not even born in this conflict are blamed for what happened. It did not, however take much for the hatred to fan out and for a comparative well-armed and prepared Serbian army to commit a series of atrocities in the regions. This is the story of one such place. It was well put together.I thought the acting reasonable. I did like, in particular, Rade Serbedzija performance. I thought he made a very interesting character.Worth seeing",4,Mass murder with ancient hate,1344729600,"08 12, 2012",2012,1302,"['did', 'movie', 'conflict', 'know', 'much', 'so', 'could', 'relate', 'History', 'was', 'not', 'kind', 'region', 'Bosnian', 'Muslims', 'Serbs', 'had', 'lived', 'together', 'centuries', 'Recently', 'Tito', 'many', 'years', 'forced', 'peace', 'When', 'Tito', 'died', 'Serbs', 'firstly', 'tried', 'keep', 'Yugoslavia', 'together', 'when', 'failed', 'tried', 'secure', 'biggest', 'part', 'Not', 'everyone', 'else', 'was', 'innocent', 'either', 'grab', 'power.Suddenly', 'Bosnian', 'Muslims', 'were', 'remembered', 'not', 'neighbors', 'friends', 'richer', 'landlords', 'almost', '100', 'years', 'ago', 'More', 'importantly', 'ww2', 'Serbs', 'suffered', 'extremely', 'badly', 'Nazis', 'Bosnian', 'Muslims', 'were', 'remembered', 'Nazi', 'allies', 'many', 'had', 'WW2', 'aligned', 'Nazis', 'were', 'seen', 'enemies', 'Serbs', 'even', 'many', 'had', 'aligned', 'anti', 'Nazis', 'Suddenly', 'young', 'people', 'not', 'even', 'born', 'conflict', 'are', 'blamed', 'what', 'happened', 'did', 'not', 'however', 'take', 'much', 'hatred', 'fan', 'out', 'comparative', 'well-armed', 'prepared', 'Serbian', 'army', 'commit', 'series', 'atrocities', 'regions', 'story', 'one', 'such', 'place', 'was', 'well', 'put', 'together.I', 'thought', 'acting', 'reasonable', 'did', 'like', 'particular', 'Rade', 'Serbedzija', 'performance', 'thought', 'made', 'very', 'interesting', 'character.Worth', 'seeing']",In the Land of Blood and Honey
1517895,A1ZDEH3V0H290C,B006OB3JLQ,"Betty ""diverduck""","[2, 2]","I have read many reviews about this before renting this and one thing that puzzles me is how viewers conclude this is a Romeo/Juliet type love story. The only true and honest love in this story is shared between the sisters Ajla (a portrait painter who's favorite subject is her sister) and Lejla and for Lejla's baby boy. Danijel is a coward and torn with mixed feelings about this war. He knows what is right and is wrong and enjoys his new power and privilege he obtained only thru his connections from his father. We watch him show indifference to the suffering and abuse the female prisoners endure as Ajla is also subjected to it, witnesses it and helps nurse them. These women could be her sister, they are her sisters and they are her. He talks about how easy it is to kill and holds the barrel of an AK47 to Ajla's head and ponders if she could kill easily herself. Female prisoners, including Ajla are used as human shields in a shoot out in a forest and these women have to watch their men burn alive. Does his so called kindness and so called love making while telling her and his command that she is his property, his personal painter and keeping her in a locked room...true Love? I think it is more like an obsession of power and sexual possession. Danijel does give her advice on how to escape. The first attempt is a disaster, but on the second she runs into a man named Tarik that brings her to a bitter sweet reunion with her sister Lejla.Their group is alone and cut off. No one to save them but themselves. Thru a rather contrived plot, Ajla allows herself to be recaptured to fake a happy reunion with Danijel. It's a rough ride for both of them. If anyone doubts the ending, just look at Ajla's self portrait at the end of the film and compare it to her portrait of her sister that she did before the war. Does it look like a portrait of a women in love? To me it looks like how she feels inside--a corpse that has been beaten and tortured beyond endurance.  A predictable ending, but most war films are. I wouldn't take it for a complete history lesson, but rather a little brush stroke on a huge canvas. It's a good film compared to others offered out there at this time.",4,"""Heaven has no rage like love to hatred turned / Nor hell a fury like a woman scorned.""",1340064000,"06 19, 2012",2012,2195,"['have', 'read', 'many', 'reviews', 'renting', 'one', 'thing', 'how', 'viewers', 'conclude', 'Romeo/Juliet', 'type', 'love', 'story', 'only', 'true', 'honest', 'love', 'story', 'shared', 'sisters', 'Ajla', 'portrait', 'painter', 'who', 'favorite', 'subject', 'sister', 'Lejla', 'Lejla', 'baby', 'boy', 'Danijel', 'coward', 'torn', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'war', 'what', 'right', 'wrong', 'new', 'power', 'privilege', 'obtained', 'only', 'thru', 'connections', 'father', 'watch', 'show', 'indifference', 'suffering', 'abuse', 'female', 'prisoners', 'endure', 'Ajla', 'also', 'subjected', 'nurse', 'women', 'could', 'be', 'sister', 'are', 'sisters', 'are', 'how', 'easy', 'kill', 'barrel', 'AK47', 'Ajla', 'head', 'ponders', 'could', 'kill', 'easily', 'Female', 'prisoners', 'including', 'Ajla', 'are', 'used', 'human', 'shields', 'shoot', 'out', 'forest', 'women', 'have', 'watch', 'men', 'burn', 'alive', 'so', 'called', 'kindness', 'so', 'called', 'love', 'making', 'telling', 'command', 'property', 'personal', 'painter', 'keeping', 'locked', 'room', 'true', 'Love', 'think', 'more', 'obsession', 'power', 'sexual', 'possession', 'Danijel', 'give', 'advice', 'how', 'escape', 'first', 'attempt', 'disaster', 'second', 'man', 'named', 'Tarik', 'bitter', 'sweet', 'reunion', 'sister', 'Lejla.Their', 'group', 'alone', 'cut', 'off', 'one', 'save', 'Thru', 'rather', 'contrived', 'plot', 'Ajla', 'be', 'recaptured', 'fake', 'happy', 'reunion', 'Danijel', 'rough', 'ride', 'anyone', 'ending', 'just', 'look', 'Ajla', 'self', 'portrait', 'end', 'film', 'compare', 'portrait', 'sister', 'did', 'war', 'look', 'portrait', 'women', 'love', 'how', 'inside', 'corpse', 'been', 'beaten', 'tortured', 'endurance', 'predictable', 'ending', 'most', 'war', 'films', 'are', 'would', ""n't"", 'take', 'complete', 'history', 'lesson', 'rather', 'little', 'brush', 'stroke', 'huge', 'canvas', 'good', 'film', 'compared', 'others', 'offered', 'there', 'time']",In the Land of Blood and Honey

1517897,A1KE3JBO3KQX2O,B006OB3JLQ,Brian C.,"[2, 2]","This was a very well done movie. It was well written and directed. The acting was superb. It is extremely visceral and moving (almost too much) and it deals with an important topic. The movie, of course, is a love story (of sorts) set against the backdrop of the war in Bosnia. It follows a Muslim woman and a Serbian soldier and tells the story of the conflict from the ground, or from the perspective of people who actually lived through it. Telling the story from the ground allows the full emotional impact of the conflict to hit home (though it has its drawbacks as well). The characters in the movie are realistic, and their actions all seem to make sense from the standpoint of their characters.I have to qualify my praise, however, for two reasons. First, the movie is very difficult to get through. I have watched other movies that deal with similar themes (such asHotel Rwanda), I have read books about the breakup of Yugoslavia, the holocaust, the Russian Revolution and Civil War, etc.. I am always deeply effected when I read about, or see on screen, the violence that humans perpetrate against each other, but I rarely have trouble finishing a movie (or a book) like this. This movie was different. I had to stop the movie about forty-five minutes in, and I was not sure if I was going to be able to finish it. This movie is not necessarily more violent than other movies (or books), and a lot of the worst violence takes place off screen (for which I was thankful), but this movie personalizes the violence, and portrays the emotional toll of the violence, in a really devastating way. I understand Angelina Jolie's desire to portray the atrocities that took place during the Bosnian war (particularly against women) but one has to walk a fine line when portraying this kind of violence. It would be dishonest to sugarcoat it, but it does no good (in my opinion) to beat the audience into a state of hopelessness and despair. The audience can only take so much at a time without becoming emotionally exhausted. I did decide to stick with the movie, and I am glad I did (the second half was a little bit easier to take), but it was touch and go there for awhile.The second reason I am slightly hesitant with my praise is that the movie seemed to me to provide more heat than light (more anger than understanding). Anger can be a positive force for change at times, but it can also be a very destructive force. I also tend to think that the anger generated from a film like this tends to dissipate fairly quickly. Understanding, on the other hand, lasts forever. In other words, if you succeed in getting people angry about the kinds of violence portrayed in this film, this will usually last a day or two and then dissipate. If, on the other hand, you provide people with greater understanding, that is something they will carry with them for the rest of their lives.This movie certainly succeeds in making the viewer angry about the violence that was committed during the Bosnian war (particularly the violence against women), but I do not really feel like I understand the Bosnian conflict much better than I did before I watched the movie. For example, we can ask a simple question: why did the Serbs invade Bosnia-Herzegovina to begin with? We do not really get an answer to that question within the film. We also do not learn a whole lot about the historical context that gave rise to these events. There are hints here and there (like when the Serbian general describes how his family was shot) but it is not really filled out enough. There is a point where one of the Serb soldiers says ""We are fighting this war so that our children will not have to go to war."" That is a very interesting perspective, but the film does not succeed in making it an intelligible perspective. It is impossible to understand, from the film alone, why any of the Serbs would believe that.So while I thought that the movie was a very well done movie, I wish there was a little more light. While I am by no means an expert on the breakup of Yugoslavia and the ensuing conflicts I thought I would provide a list of a few books I have found helpful in shedding light on various aspects of the conflicts for those who would like a little more light. In full disclosure, I should say that I have not read all of these books from cover to cover. I started a number of them over the summer, and when school started back up again, I had to put them on hold, but I have read enough from each of them to feel comfortable recommending them. I will be updating this list as I read more.Blood & Vengeanceby Chuck Sudetic tells the story of the Bosnian conflict from the standpoint of a Muslim family. Sudetic also does a good job providing the historical context for the conflict.Yugoslavia: Death of a Nationby Laura Silber and Allan Little is a good general introduction to the breakup of Yugoslavia.A Problem from Hell: America and the Age of Genocideby Samantha Power has a chapter on the Srebrenica massacre and the U.S. response.Balkan Tragedy: Chaos and Dissolution after the Cold Warby Susan Woodward goes into some of the social and economic background of the breakup of Yugoslavia and the ensuing conflicts. And finallyFirst Do No Harm: Humanitarian Intervention and the Destruction of Yugoslaviaby David Gibbs analyzes, and critiques, U.S.  and foreign involvement in the conflicts.I will simply end by saying that I think it is extremely important that we all make an effort to understand these conflicts, and movies like this have an important function in raising awareness. This movie is definitely worth watching, therefore, if you are able to stomach it.",4,More heat than light...,1349136000,"10 2, 2012",2012,5657,"['was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'movie', 'was', 'well',

1517900,A328S9RN3U5M68,B006OB3JLQ,Grady Harp,"[29, 34]","THE LAND OF BLOOD AND HONEY is stirring a lot of controversy, both bad and good.  This is actress Angelina Jolie's first outing as writer/director of a film and for many reasons she deserves applause for tackling such a subject as the Balkan War from 1992 - 1995.  Unless the viewer has studied the conditions in the once Yugoslavia, a bit of history may help the view to understand the conflict. `In 1992, conflict engulfed Bosnia and Herzegovina. The war was predominantly a territorial conflict between local Bosniaks and Croats backed by Zagreb, and Serbs backed by the Yugoslav People's Army and Serbia. The Yugoslav armed forces had disintegrated into a largely Serb-dominated military force. Opposed to the Bosnian-majority led government's agenda for independence, and along with other armed nationalist Serb militant forces, the JNA attempted to prevent Bosnian citizens from voting in the 1992 referendum on independence. This did not succeed in persuading people not to vote and instead the intimidating atmosphere combined with a Serb boycott of the vote resulted in a resounding 99% vote in support for independence. On 19 June 1992, the war in Bosnia broke out. The conflict, typified by the siege of Sarajevo and Srebrenica, was by far the bloodiest and most widely covered of the Yugoslav wars. Bosnia's Serb faction led by ultra-nationalist Radovan Karadzi' promised independence for all Serb areas of Bosnia from the majority-Bosniak government of Bosnia. To link the disjointed parts of territories populated by Serbs and areas claimed by Serbs, Karadzic pursued an agenda of systematic ethnic cleansing primarily against Bosnians through genocide and forced removal of Bosniak populations. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in the United States reported in April 1995 that 90 percent of all the atrocities in the Yugoslav wars up to that point had been committed by Serb militants. Most of these atrocities occurred in Bosnia. In 1994 the US brokered peace between Croatian forces and the Bosnian Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. After the successful Flash and Storm operations, the Croatian Army and the combined Bosnian and Croat forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, conducted an operation codenamed Operation Maestral to push back Bosnian Serb military gains.Together with NATO air strikes on the Bosnian Serbs, the successes on the ground put pressure on the Serbs to come to the negotiating table. The fighting in Croatia ended in mid-1995, after Operation Flash and Operation Storm. At the end of these operations, Croatia had managed to reclaim all of its territory except the UNPA Sector East bordering Serbia, however most of the Serbian population in these areas had become refugees, and these operations have led to war crimes indictments by the ICTY against elements of the Croat military leadership. The areas uncaptured by the Croations forces in ""Sector East"" came under UN administration (UNTAES), and were reintegrated to Croatia in 1998. The war ended with the signing of the Dayton Agreement on the 14 December 1995, with the formation of Republika Srpska as an entity within Bosnia and Herzegovina being the resolution for Bosnian Serb demands.From this background Jolie has fashioned a story that relates a strange love story that is difficult to define. Danijel (Goran Kosti') and Ajla (Zana Marjanovi'), rare in a dance hallwhen the explosive war begins Danijel is a  a Serbian policeman, becomes a captain, and Muslim artist Ajla becomes a captive. When Ajla ends up in Danijel's camp, he attempts to protect her without attracting undue attention, so she serves the men meals, but the threat of rape is ever present. Danijel's father Nebojsa (Rade rbedzija) is the general of the Serbs and discovers that his son is hiding a Muslim woman, discovers her, has her tortured, and condemns his son.  Lack of trust between the `lovers' leads to a tumultuous end.The script is slow, the movement slower, but the impact of the bestiality of war, once again based on religion, demonstrates how cruel people can become when it is Serbs against Muslims, even when the individuals are lovers. The point is made, perhaps too repeatedly, but Jolie has assembled a fine cast and manages to give us as raw a picture of war and the camps always associated with the captured ones as can be shown on the screen.  It is a necessary subject to examine: t is not an easy film to watch. Why is it controversial?  The answer lies in why is war controversial - who 'wins' when all lose?

They wouldn't tell us the name of the movie, let alone who directed it. When I find out later it was directed by Angelina Jolie , I was impressed.She did a great job capturing the atrocities of war and the lowest depths of humanity here.  The movie basically shows us the events leading to, during, and after the Bosnian war from the perspective of a Serb and a Bosnian who as it so happens are lovers.The lovers are Ajla and Danijel both excellently played by Goran Kostic and Zana Marjanovic . At first Danijel is very hesitant about carrying his orders as a Serb soldier. At first, but this doesn't last long.He either carries out or orders other members of his team to carry some barbaric actions on the Bosnian civilians they find from either rape, torture, to eventual death.When you see what happens you are going instantly think back to the Nazi's and what they did to Jews in the name of ethnic cleansing.Eventually, we see through Danijel's lead, genocide being committed at every turn. Ajla is captured, but she is treated like royalty (again at first) with no one else being able to touch or come near here except Danijel.This love story though has no happy ending as Ajla sees Danijel for what he is, not an unwilling participant in the war, but an active and willing agitator in one of the most chronicled bloodbaths recorded in Europe.""In the land of Blood and Honey"" is a superb war movie showing the type of atrocities that the Serbs were accused off while the United Nations and United States did nothing to stop it until the end.Angelina Jolie's second directorial debut is impressive.

1517915,AJRFZ0VZ0LD26,B006OB3JLQ,"Reader ""Eugenia""","[2, 3]","Many have been comparing this film with some sort of modern day Romeo and Juliet story.  Set in Balkans, during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1992, this film describes complicated intimate relationship between Serb military man who becomes officer in a civil war and his lover who is a muslim woman and an artist (painter).  They start their relationship before the war and circumstances bring them togehter once the war start when a young woman is brought into (Serb) soldiers' camp that uses women in many ways: they are servants who cook, wash, clean and serve food, but they are also sex slaves or subjects to sexual humiliations and beatings.There are several issues I have with the film.  First of all, there is no such thing as Bosnian nation. In Bosnia three major ethnic groups used to live together: Serbs, Croats and Muslims (I am not even mentioning minorities such as Roma, Jews and other ethnic groups).  All these ethnic groups are Bosnians because they lived in region of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  They share the same language and culture, except that their religion is different.  They are Orthodox Christians, Catholic Christians, Jews and Muslims, not to mention athests (i.e. hard core Communsts over there who do not believe in existance on any kind of God).  Over the centuries, many have intermarried, but traditionally - in that partof the world, each person would assume ""nationality"" of their father.  That is the entire tragedy of ethnic cleansing in Bosnia that all (three) major ethnic groups were actively taking apart of.  But let's go back to this movie.To me personally, this film is more about power and control that one person (usually the one on the ""winning"" side of the war) have over another.  It is also a sort of relationship that is forbidden not only because of lovers' ethnic differences but also because of the fact that they have a sort of ""slave/master"" relationship. In normal circusmances, this type of relationship does not have to be mutually exclusive.  It is typically carried on in private, intimate relation beteen two people who trust each other implicitly.  When bond is strong no other person, or situation can come between them.  But this type of relationship in war circumstances is extreme.  There is war and differnet people have different driving force in tough times like that.  Even family relationships come to extremes that in casual dominant/submissive relationship is typically not so relevant.  Two lovers in this film have commitments not only to each other, but also to their families (father/sister) respectively.  It is no small matter since we are speaking of life and death and even small children are not spared.  In war, all is fair and everyone is a fair game.If one removes politics, local and international conflicts and level sets this story in context of two adult people, fairly well educated, who deeply care about each other but have to make choices based on rules of war, then story is no longer a story about (dominant/submissive) love; but rather a story about survival.  It becomes a chess game where only one person can survive, but even that does not lead that individual to victory, or happiness or fulfillment.  In extreme circumsatnces like this one, everyone loses.  The only way these lovers could preserve their devotion to each other is by removing themselves completely from all of their surrounds and starting over in a place where they know no one and no one knows them.  As far as I see it, this is a deep as this movie goes.It is Angelina Jolie's directorial debit and she also wrote a screenplay for this film.  I can understand her wanting to include international aspect of it, because after all she is UNICEF ambassador has has strong personal interest in international affairs. But he superficial approach to the war in Bosnia (and Balkans in general) makes this film less believable and weak.  As a director, from the artistic point of view, she needs to find a strong mentor.  There is a lot she needs to learn about directing and the other side of the camera.",3,Love and war,1369785600,"05 29, 2013",2013,4077,"['Many', 'have', 'been', 'comparing', 'film', 'sort', 'modern', 'day', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'story', 'Set', 'Balkans', 'war', 'Bosnia', 'Herzegovina', '1992', 'film', 'complicated', 'intimate', 'relationship', 'Serb', 'military', 'man', 'who', 'officer', 'civil', 'war', 'lover', 'who', 'muslim', 'woman', 'artist', 'painter', 'start', 'relationship', 'war', 'circumstances', 'bring', 'togehter', 'once', 'war', 'start', 'when', 'young', 'woman', 'brought', 'Serb', 'soldiers', 'camp', 'women', 'many', 'ways', 'are', 'servants', 'who', 'cook', 'wash', 'clean', 'serve', 'food', 'are', 'also', 'sex', 'slaves', 'subjects', 'sexual', 'humiliations', 'are', 'several', 'issues', 'have', 'film', 'First', 'all', 'such', 'thing', 'Bosnian', 'nation', 'Bosnia', 'three', 'major', 'ethnic', 'groups', 'used', 'live', 'together', 'Serbs', 'Croats', 'Muslims', 'am', 'not', 'even', 'mentioning', 'minorities', 'such', 'Roma', 'Jews', 'other', 'ethnic', 'groups', 'ethnic', 'groups', 'are', 'Bosnians', 'lived', 'region', 'Bosnia', 'Herzegovina', 'share', 'same', 'language', 'culture', 'religion', 'different', 'are', 'Orthodox', 'Christians', 'Catholic', 'Christians', 'Jews', 'Muslims', 'not', 'mention', 'athests', 'i.e', 'hard', 'core', 'Communsts', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'existance', 'kind', 'God', 'centuries', 'many', 'have', 'intermarried', 'traditionally', 'partof', 'world', 'person', 'would', 'assume', 'nationality', 'father', 'entire', 'tragedy', 'ethnic', 'cleansing', 'Bosnia', 'three', 'major', 'ethnic', 'groups', 'were', 'actively', 'taking', 'apart', 'let', 'go', 'back', 'movie.To', 'personally', 'film', 'more', 'power', 'control', 'one', 'person', 'usually', 'one', 'winning', 'side', 'war', 'have', 'over', 'also', 'sort', 'relationship', 'forbidden', 'not', 'only', 'lovers', 'ethnic', 'differences', 'also', 'fact', 'have', 'sort', 'slave/master', 'relationship', 'normal', 'circusmances', 'type', 'relationship', 'not', 'have', 'be', 'mutually', 'exclusive', 'typically', 'carried', 'private', 'intimate', 'relation', 'beteen', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'trust', 'other', 'implicitly', 'When', 'bond', 'strong', 'other', 'person', 'situation', 'can', 'come', 'type', 'relationship', 'war', 'circumstances', 'extreme', 'war', 'differnet', 'people', 'have', 'different', 'driving', 'force', 'tough', 'times', 'Even', 'family', 'relationships', 'come', 'extremes', 'casual', 'dominant/submissive', 'relationship', 'typically', 'not', 'so', 'relevant', 'Two', 'lovers', 'film', 'have', 'commitments', 'not', 'only', 'other', 'also', 'families', 'father/sister', 'respectively', 'small', 'matter', 'are', 'speaking', 'life', 'death', 'even', 'small', 'children', 'are', 'not', 'spared', 'war', 'fair', 'everyone', 'fair', 'game.If', 'one', 'politics', 'local', 'international', 'conflicts', 'level', 'sets', 'story', 'context', 'two', 'adult', 'people', 'fairly', 'well', 'educated', 'who', 'deeply', 'care', 'other', 'have', 'make', 'choices', 'based', 'rules', 'war', 'then', 'story', 'no', 'longer', 'story', 'dominant/submissive', 'love', 'rather', 'story', 'survival', 'chess', 'game', 'where', 'only', 'one', 'person', 'can', 'survive', 'even', 'not', 'lead', 'individual', 'victory', 'happiness', 'fulfillment', 'extreme', 'circumsatnces', 'one', 'everyone', 'loses', 'only', 'way', 'lovers', 'could', 'preserve', 'devotion', 'other', 'removing', 'completely', 'surrounds', 'starting', 'over', 'place', 'where', 'know', 'one', 'one', 'As', 'far', 'see', 'deep', 'movie', 'goes.It', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'directorial', 'debit', 'also', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'film', 'can', 'understand', 'wanting', 'include', 'international', 'aspect', 'UNICEF', 'ambassador', 'strong', 'personal', 'interest', 'international', 'affairs', 'superficial', 'approach', 'war', 'Bosnia', 'Balkans', 'general', 'film', 'believable', 'weak', 'director', 'artistic', 'point', 'view', 'find', 'strong', 'mentor', 'lot', 'learn', 'directing', 'other', 'side', 'camera']",In the Land of Blood and Honey
1517916,A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ,B006OB3JLQ,Robert Blake,"[4, 5]","Angelina Jolie deserves some respect for choosing the Bosnian conflict as the subject of her directorial debut considering she could have easily settled for safer, more mainstream material, but as a writer/director she still has a long way to go and ""In The Land Of Blood And Honey"" stands as a heartfelt movie watered down by recycled melodrama. The sectarian conflicts which erupted after the shattering of Yugoslavia were already explored with greater power in the 1990s in films like ""Savior"" by Predrag Antonijevic and Milcho Manchevski's ""Before The Rain,"" while those movies told strong stories with powerful cultural messages, Jolie's movie simply shows us the horrors of the conflict as background for a standard soap opera.The film's storyline centers on a Muslim woman named Ajila (Zana Marjanovic) whose community is overrun by Christian militias led by Danijel (Goran Kostic). Eight months earlier they had already met at a cafe where a romantic dance floor moment was interrupted by the first bombs of the war. As soldiers go around looting and raping, Ajila finds herself taken captive with a group of women to a nearby base where Danijel decides to give her careful protection, this puts him at risk because his warlord father Nebojsa (Rade Serbedzija) is determined to wipe out all Muslims in a storm of ethnic hatred.""In The Land Of Blood And Honey"" proves Jolie has an eye for capturing memorable images and establishing a place, she knows how to use her camera. She also doesn't flinch away from the horrors of war and provides up close moments of terror and heartbreaking violence, with unflinching honesty she shows how rape is used as a weapon in conflict zones. But Jolie's canvas remains dry, she SHOWS us the horror of the Bosnian war but never digs deep enough into her characters, their backgrounds and the dimensions of their experiences. It's as if the war's grisly details are presented in the style of a high school essay and the characters are no more than vessels for Jolie's overall, general idealization of love surpassing ethnic boundaries (although the ending might seems to leave hope behind). We know what Jolie WANTS to say (the message itself is admirable) but she fumbles in the delivery. For example Ajila and Danijel never have a conversation that feels real, they never have a moment where you really sense or feel the soul-twisting political/religious/social dilemmas they now face, they simply lock up in a room, have intense sex and move along to the basic schemes of a potboiler. Some scenes seem to end abruptly when they should be allowed to play out more, some transitions feel like leaps, leaving confusing or sometimes vague plot holes in the story. The love story itself doesn't develop with a convincing rhythm or sense of real emotional growth.The conflict in the former Yugoslavia is indeed an important event in recent world history, the kind of violence and sectarian terror unleashed there can be seen recycled in a place like Syria today. But of course most Americans have no idea about the events depicted in the film or could care less, so in that sense Jolie's bravery should be commended. But she also suffers from the kind of typical, postmodern attitude dominant in the arts these days except for a few veterans like Oliver Stone. Basically her film laments at how awful the Bosnian war was and has a general critique here of religious division lines, but these ideas have been expressed much better in other films, here she has little to really SAY about the whole history of the region and the conflict. It's as if Jolie wants to play that typical game of exploring a political issue without being political. A few characters say a few lines about Communism's collapse and how it opened the door to sectarian divisions (under Tito ethnic and religious differences were rightfully cast aside as official state policy), but Jolie's views are somewhat vague, she's obviously against war in general, but she never presents any sort of bold political stance. The UN, NATO are almost cartoonish background characters. Maybe it just isn't fashionable in these times to clearly make a political statement.While this film isn't a complete success, it still announces Angelina Jolie as a director with promise, maybe her next effort will be more focused and tighter. It's refreshing to see a celebrity of her calibre with historical, geopolitical interests and it would be a shame to see her fall back into ""mainstream"" genre filmmaking (like Kenneth Branagh with ""Thor"").

After the first viewing of the movie, I immediately viewed it again, and then I replayed the ending--a perfectly fitting, truthful, and unsentimental ending.The inner struggles of the protagonists for dignity and integrity are spirited and moving and bring into sharp relief the atrocities of war. The beginning scene, before the war starts, is just lovely in its innocence and playfulness--all lost in the war. Every detail in every scene is meticulously thought through and poetically expressed. The actors you have chosen are truly accomplished and sensitive, as a leaf in the wind, to different emotional undercurrents. From start to finish, they are convincing in their passion and in their vulnerability. It is a story as old as Romeo and Juliet but also new in its portrayal of intense ethnic hate that has become the hall mark of the 20th century. Your interweaving of the personal and national themes is remarkable and heart-wrenching at every turn.One more thing: at first I thought that the English language spoken in the movie (rather than the local language) would impede the movie's credibility, but it didn't. The plot and the characters are so convincing, and the dialogue so terse and poignant, that the language becomes a universal language of love and war--the eternal subjects of art.Your movie is searing and unforgettable.Bravo!",5,A Masterpiece,1340668800,"06 26, 2012",2012,1546,"['Angelina', 'Jolie', 'are', 'great', 'artist', 'greatness', 'writing', 'directing', 'such', 'thoughtful', 'beautiful', 'visceral', 'movie', 'also', 'condemnation', 'war', 'celebration', 'love', 'first', 'viewing', 'movie', 'immediately', 'viewed', 'again', 'then', 'replayed', 'ending', 'perfectly', 'fitting', 'truthful', 'unsentimental', 'ending.The', 'inner', 'struggles', 'protagonists', 'dignity', 'integrity', 'are', 'spirited', 'moving', 'bring', 'sharp', 'relief', 'atrocities', 'war', 'beginning', 'scene', 'war', 'just', 'lovely', 'innocence', 'playfulness', 'lost', 'war', 'detail', 'scene', 'meticulously', 'thought', 'poetically', 'expressed', 'actors', 'have', 'chosen', 'are', 'truly', 'accomplished', 'sensitive', 'leaf', 'wind', 'different', 'emotional', 'undercurrents', 'start', 'finish', 'are', 'convincing', 'passion', 'vulnerability', 'story', 'as', 'old', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'also', 'new', 'portrayal', 'intense', 'ethnic', 'hate', 'become', 'hall', 'mark', '20th', 'century', 'interweaving', 'personal', 'national', 'themes', 'remarkable', 'heart-wrenching', 'turn.One', 'more', 'thing', 'first', 'thought', 'English', 'language', 'spoken', 'movie', 'rather', 'local', 'language', 'would', 'impede', 'movie', 'credibility', 'did', ""n't"", 'plot', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'convincing', 'dialogue', 'so', 'terse', 'poignant', 'language', 'universal', 'language', 'love', 'war', 'eternal', 'subjects', 'art.Your', 'movie', 'searing', 'unforgettable.Bravo']",In the Land of Blood and Honey

Her directorial debut deals with such serious issues as sexual violence during the war, a topic addressed also in films like ""Grbavica: the Land of My Dreams"" in 2006, but somehow Jolie as filmmaker decided that the film needs a love story.The film's love story centers on Danijel (Goran Kostic), a son of a strict Serbian general, and Ajla (Zana Marjanovic), a Muslim painter. The war begins and the ex-lovers meet each other again at a prisoner camp, one as commander, the other as prisoner.I am no expert on weaponry and artillery, so I have nothing to say about the accuracies or inaccuracies of the uniforms and weapons.

While Jolie and photographer Dean Semler (""Dances with Wolves"") successfully creates the oppressive atmosphere of the war-torn country, the serious message of the film is underdmined by the thin and underdeveloped love story.Though clearly made with all good intention, ""In the Land of Blood and Honey"" needs more credible character developments and skilled storytelling.",3,Well-Intentioned But Too Melodramatic,1376956800,"08 20, 2013",2013,1327,"['Written', 'directed', 'co-produced', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'Land', 'Blood', 'Honey', 'romance', 'set', 'Bosnian', 'War', 'directorial', 'debut', 'deals', 'such', 'serious', 'issues', 'sexual', 'violence', 'war', 'topic', 'addressed', 'also', 'films', 'Grbavica', 'Land', 'My', 'Dreams', '2006', 'somehow', 'Jolie', 'filmmaker', 'decided', 'film', 'love', 'story.The', 'film', 'love', 'story', 'centers', 'Danijel', 'Goran', 'Kostic', 'son', 'strict', 'Serbian', 'general', 'Ajla', 'Zana', 'Marjanovic', 'Muslim', 'painter', 'war', 'ex-lovers', 'meet', 'other', 'again', 'prisoner', 'camp', 'one', 'commander', 'other', 'prisoner.I', 'am', 'expert', 'weaponry', 'artillery', 'have', 'nothing', 'say', 'accuracies', 'inaccuracies', 'uniforms', 'weapons', 'may', 'take', 'issue', 'film', 'political', 'leanings', 'will', 'not', 'discuss', 'here', 'either.My', 'main', 'complaint', 'uneven', 'narrative', 'style', 'uncomfortably', 'grim', 'sentimental', 'Jolie', 'photographer', 'Dean', 'Semler', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'successfully', 'oppressive', 'atmosphere', 'war-torn', 'country', 'serious', 'message', 'film', 'underdmined', 'thin', 'underdeveloped', 'love', 'story.Though', 'clearly', 'made', 'good', 'intention', 'Land', 'Blood', 'Honey', 'more', 'credible', 'character', 'developments', 'skilled', 'storytelling']",In the Land of Blood and Honey
