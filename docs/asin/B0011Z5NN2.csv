1133464,A1MR4HA8LUGCQS,B0011Z5NN2,Elizabeth Richards,"[9, 13]","I am very familiar with Deepak Chopra's work, and I am a big fan of his.  I am right in line with his beliefs, and my new favorite book is Reinventing the Body, Resurrecting the Soul, and I very much recommend that book and/or audio cd.  I have both.  I have MANY of his books, and love them all.  But THIS.  This dvd is just wrong - I don't know what Deepak had in mind when he decided to wear Elton John-like red sparkly glasses.  It completely corrupts his message, in my opinion.  And I LOVE this guy!  My husband and I just couldn't help laughing most of the time while we were watching this because the glasses are just that distracting.  They sparkle!  Deepak Chopra is talking about meditation, chakras, changing your perspective, unity of all things, and these glasses are catching the light everywhere he turns.  This is a great thinker and he's wearing movie star glitter.  The one saving grace are the two meditations under ""Extras"" on the second dvd.  Those are quite enjoyable.  But honestly, I also didn't like the audience format and the small groups of people he sits with.  It's all distracting, and keeps me from wanting to watch again - again, the glasses and the extra people corrupt the message.  I would have preferred just having him speak to the camera.",2,Not His Best Work,1265846400,"02 11, 2010",2010,1278,"['am', 'very', 'familiar', 'Deepak', 'Chopra', 'work', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'am', 'right', 'line', 'beliefs', 'new', 'favorite', 'book', 'Reinventing', 'Body', 'Resurrecting', 'Soul', 'very', 'much', 'recommend', 'book', 'audio', 'cd', 'have', 'have', 'MANY', 'books', 'love', 'THIS', 'dvd', 'just', 'wrong', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'Deepak', 'had', 'mind', 'when', 'decided', 'wear', 'Elton', 'John-like', 'red', 'sparkly', 'glasses', 'completely', 'message', 'opinion', 'LOVE', 'guy', 'husband', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'laughing', 'most', 'time', 'were', 'watching', 'glasses', 'are', 'just', 'distracting', 'sparkle', 'Deepak', 'Chopra', 'talking', 'meditation', 'chakras', 'changing', 'perspective', 'unity', 'things', 'glasses', 'are', 'catching', 'light', 'everywhere', 'great', 'thinker', 'wearing', 'movie', 'star', 'glitter', 'one', 'saving', 'grace', 'are', 'two', 'meditations', 'Extras', 'second', 'dvd', 'are', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'honestly', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'audience', 'format', 'small', 'groups', 'people', 'distracting', 'keeps', 'wanting', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'glasses', 'extra', 'people', 'corrupt', 'message', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'just', 'having', 'speak', 'camera']",The Deepak Chopra: The Happiness Prescription

1133466,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B0011Z5NN2,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[5, 6]","Deepak Chopra believes that if you are happy you will naturally be healthier and more successful. He explains how we have the happiness formula backwards. Wealth does not bring happiness but being happy might bring wealth. This is probably just because you will have a more positive outlook on life.In this DVD, Deepak Chopra explores meditation, cognitive therapy, pleasure, existential suffering, peace, harmony, good relationships, money, choices we make daily, helping humanity, dreams for the world, death, love and compassion. He explains how we should live in the present, get rid of toxic emotions and replace fear with love.The audience is very responsive and there are quite a few times Deepak Chopra has everyone laughing. They do become really quiet when he starts discussing death.While most of this DVD is about Buddhist teachings there is one mention of Jesus Christ. I found that this DVD could be enjoyed by anyone of any religion. The only thing I found myself questioning was Deepak's advice to a young boy to tell people he was ""universal"" when describing how he felt about religion. While you can take something good from most religions and personally apply it to your life I think it would be very difficult to say believe in a religion that worships idols and worship the one true God. It would seem that you would always be in conflict in such a case.Deepak appears in this video wearing his trademark red sparkly glasses. He is very nicely dressed with a matching red shirt and red shoes. At first the glasses were a bit distracting but he is an excellent storyteller and soon I was enjoying his tales from India. I felt that watching this DVD confirmed some of my beliefs like that happiness comes from making other people happy and that you are happier when you have a sense of accomplishment.~The Rebecca Review",5,Be Healthier and More Successful,1256860800,"10 30, 2009",2009,1839,"['Deepak', 'Chopra', 'are', 'happy', 'will', 'naturally', 'be', 'healthier', 'more', 'successful', 'how', 'have', 'happiness', 'formula', 'backwards', 'Wealth', 'not', 'bring', 'happiness', 'being', 'happy', 'might', 'bring', 'wealth', 'probably', 'just', 'will', 'have', 'more', 'positive', 'outlook', 'life.In', 'DVD', 'Deepak', 'Chopra', 'meditation', 'cognitive', 'therapy', 'pleasure', 'existential', 'suffering', 'peace', 'harmony', 'good', 'relationships', 'money', 'make', 'daily', 'helping', 'humanity', 'dreams', 'world', 'death', 'love', 'compassion', 'how', 'should', 'live', 'present', 'get', 'rid', 'toxic', 'emotions', 'replace', 'fear', 'love.The', 'audience', 'very', 'responsive', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'times', 'Deepak', 'Chopra', 'everyone', 'laughing', 'do', 'become', 'really', 'quiet', 'when', 'discussing', 'death.While', 'most', 'DVD', 'Buddhist', 'teachings', 'one', 'mention', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'found', 'DVD', 'could', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'anyone', 'religion', 'only', 'thing', 'found', 'questioning', 'was', 'Deepak', 'advice', 'young', 'boy', 'tell', 'people', 'was', 'universal', 'when', 'describing', 'how', 'felt', 'religion', 'can', 'take', 'something', 'good', 'most', 'religions', 'personally', 'apply', 'life', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'difficult', 'say', 'believe', 'religion', 'idols', 'worship', 'one', 'true', 'God', 'would', 'seem', 'would', 'always', 'be', 'conflict', 'such', 'case.Deepak', 'video', 'wearing', 'trademark', 'red', 'sparkly', 'glasses', 'very', 'nicely', 'dressed', 'matching', 'red', 'shirt', 'red', 'shoes', 'first', 'glasses', 'were', 'bit', 'distracting', 'excellent', 'storyteller', 'soon', 'was', 'enjoying', 'tales', 'India', 'felt', 'watching', 'DVD', 'confirmed', 'beliefs', 'happiness', 'making', 'other', 'people', 'happy', 'are', 'happier', 'when', 'have', 'sense', 'accomplishment.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",The Deepak Chopra: The Happiness Prescription
