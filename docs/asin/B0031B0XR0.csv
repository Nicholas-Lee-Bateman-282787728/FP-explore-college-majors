1317025,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,B0031B0XR0,Bobby Underwood,"[19, 19]","""The funny thing is, after all that's happened, I still miss the old me."" -- JuneThis light and romantic confection from South Korea is perfect when you just want a scrumptious treat rather than a full meal. Filled with a breezy charm, and an adorable performance from Korean pop star and actress, Uhm Jung-hwa, it is often funny, and sometimes tender, yet never forgets that it is a sweet romantic comedy. By never trying to be more than it is, it succeeds in being one of the best in that genre. Director Sang-woo Kim's 2006 film was released in time for Christmas moviegoers to enjoy the mood the season always brings. While the story itself has nothing to do with the holidays, the tone and atmosphere of the film was a good fit a Christmastime mood. Opposite Jung-hwa, is Korean-American actor and model, Daniel Henney. The role was a good fit for him, and he comes off well as a stoic and somewhat calculating corporate shark, charmed by the cute Jung-hwa, just as the audience has been.Lovable and sweet Min-joon, whom everyone calls June, is wondering if she can find a love that doesn't leave her lonely. Dumped twice, she is on the verge of it again when she crashes into Robin Heiden's car from behind. Well-dressed and very much in control, he speaks fluent English, refusing to speak Korean. June pretends to only speak Korean, unaware he is her new corporate boss. This multi-language film, with Robin speaking English and June speaking Korean, proves charming, and is often cited as a factor in the film's success. Robin deliberately picks her as his new assistant, and she begins to feel like James Bond, in a world of corporate spies. Robin is very much in the mold of an up and coming corporate raider, and plays his romantic life in much the same manner. When she is dumped for the third time, he offers no shoulder to cry on, but chastises her for bringing it on herself.Her attempts to win him over so he'll pay up and apologize for the awful things he said to her are often humorous, and never fruitful. Plans A, B, and C all fail, but after a truly funny scene at a party, where another bet is made, a kiss occurs which changes everything. His attempts to remake her into a player able to manipulate love, and win her boyfriend back, has an unsettling effect, however, on both he and her. She discovers that her sweetness and honesty may be working against her in the game of love, but she'd rather be the old her than this new girl. She also discovers the reason behind Robin's cool exterior, amidst a corporate takeover. While we've all seen this before, there's a bit of a twist, as is often the case in Korean films, and enough sweetness to make the journey worth while. Definitely the flip side of the more serious romanticist cinema Korea has made their own over the last decade, this one is breezy and enjoyable on a much lighter, less serious level.Uhm Jung-hwa's captivating performance, and a cheery atmosphere, with just the right songs mixed in, make for a pleasant time at the movies. A definite charmer, deserving of an A+ rating as a date movie. Fluff, but tremendously enjoyable fluff, proving once again just what a force South Korea has become in the film industry.",5,Enjoyable Romantic Comedy,1276992000,"06 20, 2010",2010,3206,"['funny', 'thing', 'happened', 'still', 'miss', 'old', 'JuneThis', 'light', 'romantic', 'confection', 'South', 'Korea', 'perfect', 'when', 'just', 'want', 'scrumptious', 'treat', 'rather', 'full', 'meal', 'Filled', 'breezy', 'charm', 'adorable', 'performance', 'Korean', 'pop', 'star', 'actress', 'Uhm', 'Jung-hwa', 'often', 'funny', 'sometimes', 'tender', 'yet', 'never', 'sweet', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'never', 'trying', 'be', 'more', 'being', 'one', 'best', 'genre', 'Director', 'Sang-woo', 'Kim', '2006', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'time', 'Christmas', 'moviegoers', 'enjoy', 'mood', 'season', 'always', 'story', 'nothing', 'do', 'holidays', 'tone', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'was', 'good', 'fit', 'Christmastime', 'mood', 'Opposite', 'Jung-hwa', 'Korean-American', 'actor', 'model', 'Daniel', 'Henney', 'role', 'was', 'good', 'fit', 'off', 'well', 'stoic', 'somewhat', 'calculating', 'corporate', 'shark', 'charmed', 'cute', 'Jung-hwa', 'just', 'audience', 'been.Lovable', 'sweet', 'Min-joon', 'whom', 'everyone', 'June', 'wondering', 'can', 'find', 'love', ""n't"", 'leave', 'lonely', 'Dumped', 'twice', 'verge', 'again', 'when', 'Robin', 'Heiden', 'car', 'behind', 'Well-dressed', 'very', 'much', 'control', 'fluent', 'English', 'refusing', 'speak', 'Korean', 'June', 'only', 'speak', 'Korean', 'unaware', 'new', 'corporate', 'boss', 'multi-language', 'film', 'Robin', 'speaking', 'English', 'June', 'speaking', 'Korean', 'charming', 'often', 'cited', 'factor', 'film', 'success', 'Robin', 'deliberately', 'new', 'assistant', 'feel', 'James', 'Bond', 'world', 'corporate', 'spies', 'Robin', 'very', 'much', 'mold', 'up', 'coming', 'corporate', 'raider', 'romantic', 'life', 'much', 'same', 'manner', 'When', 'dumped', 'third', 'time', 'shoulder', 'cry', 'bringing', 'herself.Her', 'attempts', 'win', 'over', 'so', ""'ll"", 'pay', 'up', 'apologize', 'awful', 'things', 'said', 'are', 'often', 'humorous', 'never', 'fruitful', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'fail', 'truly', 'funny', 'scene', 'party', 'where', 'bet', 'made', 'kiss', 'everything', 'attempts', 'remake', 'player', 'able', 'manipulate', 'love', 'win', 'boyfriend', 'back', 'unsettling', 'effect', 'however', 'sweetness', 'honesty', 'may', 'be', 'working', 'game', 'love', ""'d"", 'rather', 'be', 'old', 'new', 'girl', 'also', 'reason', 'Robin', 'cool', 'exterior', 'corporate', 'takeover', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'before', 'bit', 'twist', 'often', 'case', 'Korean', 'films', 'enough', 'sweetness', 'make', 'journey', 'worth', 'Definitely', 'flip', 'side', 'more', 'serious', 'romanticist', 'cinema', 'Korea', 'made', 'own', 'last', 'decade', 'one', 'breezy', 'enjoyable', 'much', 'lighter', 'less', 'serious', 'level.Uhm', 'Jung-hwa', 'captivating', 'performance', 'cheery', 'atmosphere', 'just', 'right', 'songs', 'mixed', 'make', 'pleasant', 'time', 'movies', 'definite', 'charmer', 'deserving', 'A+', 'rating', 'date', 'movie', 'Fluff', 'tremendously', 'enjoyable', 'fluff', 'proving', 'once', 'again', 'just', 'what', 'force', 'South', 'Korea', 'become', 'film', 'industry']",Seducing Mr. Perfect
