733607,A1RVT44SHQV8EC,B0000844KY,"Able Devildog ""jackjack5""","[0, 0]","This concert is in Berlin and Andre Rieu speaks in German which then is shown in English sub-titles. This annoying because the viewer does not catch the humor of Rieu's remarks which often depends on the pitch of his voice.The concert is great but typically of Rieu the viewer only gets part of the concert and for this reason I did not rate the DVD as highly as I might have other wise. If the viewer wants to see how the rest of the concert went, the viewer will have to purchase &quot;Dreaming&quot;, which I do not recommend because it is an incredibly boring DVD. But that DVD contains segments of the remainder of the  Berlin concert. Viewers of &quot;La vie est belle&quot; will note that Rieu tells the audience that it looks like rain. However, why Rieu made that remark is never apparent. It is in &quot;Dreaming&quot; where segments of the latter part of the concert are shown and it is pouring rain and even the members of the orchestra have to put on coats. What the viewer also sees is that all the good music was played in this DVD where in &quot;Dreaming&quot; the music that was played later was not only boring, poorly arranged, and poorly played so maybe it is a good thing that the remainder of the concert was omitted in the DVD.Nevertheless, it one of my favorites.",3,What you get is splendid but too much is missing.,1063929600,"09 19, 2003",2003,1287,"['concert', 'Berlin', 'Andre', 'Rieu', 'German', 'then', 'shown', 'English', 'sub-titles', 'annoying', 'viewer', 'not', 'catch', 'humor', 'Rieu', 'remarks', 'often', 'pitch', 'voice.The', 'concert', 'great', 'typically', 'Rieu', 'viewer', 'only', 'part', 'concert', 'reason', 'did', 'not', 'rate', 'DVD', 'as', 'highly', 'might', 'have', 'other', 'wise', 'viewer', 'see', 'how', 'rest', 'concert', 'went', 'viewer', 'will', 'have', 'purchase', 'quot', 'Dreaming', 'quot', 'do', 'not', 'recommend', 'incredibly', 'boring', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'segments', 'remainder', 'Berlin', 'concert', 'Viewers', 'quot', 'La', 'vie', 'est', 'belle', 'quot', 'will', 'note', 'Rieu', 'audience', 'rain', 'However', 'why', 'Rieu', 'made', 'remark', 'never', 'apparent', 'quot', 'Dreaming', 'quot', 'where', 'segments', 'latter', 'part', 'concert', 'are', 'shown', 'pouring', 'rain', 'even', 'members', 'orchestra', 'have', 'put', 'coats', 'What', 'viewer', 'also', 'good', 'music', 'was', 'played', 'DVD', 'where', 'quot', 'Dreaming', 'quot', 'music', 'was', 'played', 'later', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'boring', 'poorly', 'arranged', 'poorly', 'played', 'so', 'maybe', 'good', 'thing', 'remainder', 'concert', 'was', 'omitted', 'DVD.Nevertheless', 'one', 'favorites']",N/A
733608,A2DJGR917JJYDL,B0000844KY,"Gerald E. Murphy ""Warrior""","[12, 13]","Recorded at Waldb&uuml;hne Berlin, this video is very highly rated for musicianship and choice of beautiful music, but videographer Karl M&uuml;ller ought to spend the rest of his days in isolated rehab.  There is very little time spent on any particular frame of video.  It is more like the editor is on a heavy trip with speed, given the nearly constant pan, zoom, fade in and out, jump frentically from scene to scene, and attempts to cover every member of this brilliant orchastra and chorus, and most members of the audience, on every piece of beautiful music. Such shabby editing detracts from an otherwise terrific album; listen to it closely, but don't waste any time looking at it. Something else missing, besides mature editing, is the participation by the always gorgeous and talented sopranos Carmen Monarcha and Carla Maffioletti, either or both of whom would certainly make the title worthy of being called Life is Beautiful.  They are not featured at all.",3,La vie est belle -- Life is Beautiful; Andre Rieu,1168473600,"01 11, 2007",2007,970,"['Recorded', 'Waldb', 'uuml', 'Berlin', 'video', 'very', 'highly', 'rated', 'musicianship', 'choice', 'beautiful', 'music', 'videographer', 'Karl', 'M', 'uuml', 'ought', 'spend', 'rest', 'days', 'isolated', 'rehab', 'very', 'little', 'time', 'spent', 'particular', 'frame', 'video', 'more', 'editor', 'heavy', 'trip', 'speed', 'given', 'nearly', 'constant', 'pan', 'zoom', 'fade', 'jump', 'frentically', 'scene', 'scene', 'attempts', 'cover', 'member', 'brilliant', 'orchastra', 'chorus', 'most', 'members', 'audience', 'piece', 'beautiful', 'music', 'Such', 'shabby', 'editing', 'detracts', 'otherwise', 'terrific', 'album', 'closely', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'looking', 'Something', 'else', 'missing', 'mature', 'editing', 'participation', 'always', 'gorgeous', 'talented', 'sopranos', 'Carmen', 'Monarcha', 'Carla', 'Maffioletti', 'either', 'whom', 'would', 'certainly', 'make', 'title', 'worthy', 'being', 'called', 'Life', 'Beautiful', 'are', 'not', 'featured']",N/A
