It's filled with fun sing-alongs that incorporate vocabulary and conjugation that young children can enjoy.  I have several of the other DVD's in the series as well and they are fantastic!  The little mouse, Fritzi, is my son's favorite.  He's a cute little animated mouse that interacts with the other characters in the movie.",5,Great DVD for my young son!,1345939200,"08 26, 2012",2012,420,"['bought', 'DVD', 'son', 'way', 'introduce', 'familiarize', 'Spanish', 'filled', 'fun', 'sing-alongs', 'incorporate', 'vocabulary', 'conjugation', 'young', 'children', 'can', 'enjoy', 'have', 'several', 'other', 'DVD', 'series', 'well', 'are', 'fantastic', 'little', 'mouse', 'Fritzi', 'son', 'favorite', 'cute', 'little', 'animated', 'mouse', 'other', 'characters', 'movie']",Spanish for Kids: Adentro y Afuera
1256884,A2QX49LS3Y3ANI,B0029KN8BC,Dienne,"[10, 12]","I took German in high school for the sole reason that the German class took a trip to Germany every year, whereas the Spanish class didn't travel.  Then in college I abandoned German for Russian and was told that I have ""an incorrigible American accent"" (perhaps because I'm an incorrigible American?).  And I've spent my adult life regretting those decisions because Spanish would be a very useful language to know, but despite repeated efforts of varying lengths and diligence, I simply can't master it.  Therefore, when I had kids I resolved that one way or another, they would master at least two languages while they're young enough to do it relatively easily.The problem is that it is very difficult for a monolingual parent to raise a bilingual child.  Videos and CDs only do so much because they are passive learning.  Books can help add interaction, but I don't want my kids learning Spanish with my bad pronunciation.  The best choice is language immersion, but such programs don't come cheap.  In fact, when I enroll my older daughter in public school next year, I'm tempted to pretend she doesn't speak English so they'll put her in the bilingual program.  But something tells me they won't believe me.With all of that said, this video (and the other Whistlefritz videos) is perhaps the best introductions to Spanish that I've found for young children.  Yes, it's passive learning, but it's engaging enough to keep kids' attention and the songs are catchy enough to get kids to try to sing along.  ""Maria"" has a bubbly and engaging child-friendly personality which draws younger kids to want to participate with her.  The best part is that it is solely in Spanish and kids learn from visual cues such as the objects in the video and Maria's facial expressions.  This helps to learn to actually put Spanish together as a complete language, rather than just a collection of vocabulary words.This particular Whistlefritz video focuses largely on relational words and phrases such as ""behind"", ""in front of"", ""next to"", etc.  There is also a segment focusing on food and eating and, of course, the obligatory walk through counting to ten.  A rather amusing scene involving cookies which mysteriously disappear during each counting combines all of these lessons.  My daughters also like the mouse, Fritzy.  There are three or four songs on the video that mesh well with the lesson themes.  For instance, one song is a dancing song and instructs the kids to wave their hands over their heads, or in front of their bodies, or out to the side.  Another song is about food.We've been watching this video for about three weeks, probably once every two to four days, and my daughters seem to understand most of what's going on and have even been picking up on some words and phrases.  My older daughter asks for the video fairly often but that is in part because she knows that except for Saturdays the only videos I'll let her watch are Spanish ones - at least it's her favorite language video, even if she still prefers English videos.  Recommended for young children - probably the same target audience as Sesame Street.The video is also helpful for parents.  It's simplistic enough that I can follow what's happening and start to put phrases and sentences together.  Maybe there's hope for me yet.My only complaint about the video is that it's rather expensive for only 30 minutes of playing time, but it's not out of line with other language instruction videos and materials.  Unless you're lucky enough to live in a bilingual family, learning languages is an expensive proposition.  4.5 stars.",4,Spanish for young children - and their parents,1306195200,"05 24, 2011",2011,3600,"['took', 'German', 'high', 'school', 'sole', 'reason', 'German', 'class', 'took', 'trip', 'Germany', 'year', 'Spanish', 'class', 'did', ""n't"", 'travel', 'Then', 'college', 'abandoned', 'German', 'Russian', 'was', 'told', 'have', 'incorrigible', 'American', 'accent', 'perhaps', ""'m"", 'incorrigible', 'American', ""'ve"", 'spent', 'adult', 'life', 'regretting', 'decisions', 'Spanish', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'useful', 'language', 'know', 'repeated', 'efforts', 'varying', 'lengths', 'diligence', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'master', 'Therefore', 'when', 'had', 'kids', 'resolved', 'one', 'way', 'would', 'master', 'least', 'two', 'languages', ""'re"", 'young', 'enough', 'do', 'relatively', 'easily.The', 'problem', 'very', 'difficult', 'monolingual', 'parent', 'raise', 'bilingual', 'child', 'Videos', 'CDs', 'only', 'do', 'so', 'much', 'are', 'passive', 'learning', 'Books', 'can', 'help', 'add', 'interaction', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'kids', 'learning', 'Spanish', 'bad', 'pronunciation', 'best', 'choice', 'language', 'immersion', 'such', 'programs', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'cheap', 'fact', 'when', 'enroll', 'older', 'daughter', 'public', 'school', 'next', 'year', ""'m"", 'tempted', 'pretend', ""n't"", 'speak', 'English', ""'ll"", 'put', 'bilingual', 'program', 'something', 'tells', 'wo', ""n't"", 'believe', 'me.With', 'said', 'video', 'other', 'Whistlefritz', 'videos', 'perhaps', 'best', 'introductions', 'Spanish', ""'ve"", 'found', 'young', 'children', 'Yes', 'passive', 'learning', 'engaging', 'enough', 'keep', 'kids', 'attention', 'songs', 'are', 'catchy', 'enough', 'get', 'kids', 'try', 'sing', 'along', 'Maria', 'bubbly', 'engaging', 'child-friendly', 'personality', 'younger', 'kids', 'want', 'participate', 'best', 'part', 'solely', 'Spanish', 'kids', 'learn', 'visual', 'cues', 'such', 'objects', 'video', 'Maria', 'facial', 'expressions', 'learn', 'actually', 'put', 'Spanish', 'together', 'complete', 'language', 'rather', 'just', 'collection', 'vocabulary', 'words.This', 'particular', 'Whistlefritz', 'video', 'largely', 'relational', 'words', 'phrases', 'such', 'front', 'next', 'etc', 'also', 'segment', 'focusing', 'food', 'eating', 'course', 'obligatory', 'walk', 'counting', 'ten', 'rather', 'amusing', 'scene', 'involving', 'cookies', 'mysteriously', 'disappear', 'counting', 'combines', 'lessons', 'daughters', 'also', 'mouse', 'Fritzy', 'are', 'three', 'four', 'songs', 'video', 'well', 'lesson', 'themes', 'instance', 'one', 'song', 'dancing', 'song', 'kids', 'wave', 'hands', 'heads', 'front', 'bodies', 'side', 'song', 'food.We', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'video', 'about', 'three', 'weeks', 'probably', 'once', 'two', 'four', 'days', 'daughters', 'seem', 'understand', 'most', 'what', 'going', 'have', 'even', 'been', 'picking', 'up', 'words', 'phrases', 'older', 'daughter', 'asks', 'video', 'fairly', 'often', 'part', 'Saturdays', 'only', 'videos', ""'ll"", 'let', 'watch', 'are', 'Spanish', 'ones', 'least', 'favorite', 'language', 'video', 'even', 'still', 'English', 'videos', 'Recommended', 'young', 'children', 'probably', 'same', 'target', 'audience', 'Sesame', 'Street.The', 'video', 'also', 'helpful', 'parents', 'simplistic', 'enough', 'can', 'follow', 'what', 'happening', 'start', 'put', 'phrases', 'sentences', 'together', 'Maybe', 'hope', 'only', 'complaint', 'video', 'rather', 'expensive', 'only', '30', 'minutes', 'playing', 'time', 'not', 'line', 'other', 'language', 'instruction', 'videos', 'materials', ""'re"", 'lucky', 'enough', 'live', 'bilingual', 'family', 'learning', 'languages', 'expensive', 'proposition', '4.5', 'stars']",Spanish for Kids: Adentro y Afuera

1256888,A1V7RL4ODXXWDM,B0029KN8BC,"Jennifer Bogart ""@ Quiverfullfamily.com""","[76, 79]","Educational research continues to point out that the best method for learning a second language is in early childhood, through immersion - the same way children learn their mother tongue. Living North America puts parents who seek to give their children a bilingual advantage in a difficult position. The vast majority of us are monolingual, speaking only English, the international language of trade and commerce.So, what's a mom to do who wants to equip her young children with a solid foundation in a second language when she only speaks one? The lack of high quality resource for Spanish immersion was just the catalyst needed for one mom to launch Whistlefritz and the Spanish for Beginners series in 2006.The latest release in the series - Adentro y Afuera (Inside and Out) is designed to appeal to children from ages two through seven - and does it ever. Who would have thought that a 30-minute DVD, entirely in Spanish, would so captivate the hearts and attention of my one, three, and six-year-old?I was a bit skeptical as I popped in the disc. My children are largely unfamiliar with Spanish. They've seen Dora, watched some educational DVDs that teach common phrases through English to Spanish translation and repetition, but have no formal language education under their belts. I was so surprised to find my children singing, dancing, and laughing throughout an entirely Spanish presentation of what could pass for cable television children's programming.The animated host ""Maria"" leads children through scenarios revolving around a small, animated mouse named Fritzi who whistles to communicate (hence the company name, Whistlefritz.) Similar in style to the popular television series Blues Clues, Maria and her gang of multi-cultural children in the target age ranges interact against a colourful, cartoon backdrop with the animated mouse, and a variety of entertaining hand puppets. Live action segments are also interspersed throughout the DVD, showing the children interacting and singing in real settings.Maria communicates the meaning of the Spanish words she uses through repetition, exaggerated facial expressions, props, hand gestures, and body movements. Her level of enthusiasm is contagious, and she is an excellent teacher. Narrative teaching is broken up with songs from Horge Anya which include activity songs where children are prompted to perform certain hand movements in response to the lyrics, songs about food, songs about the directions (up and down) and so on.The narrative teaching focuses on greetings, room names, common locations (in front of, on the side of, on top of, etc.), food names, numbers up to ten, bathroom tasks, and more. A vocabulary guide which includes the Spanish words in the order they are presented on the disc, and their English translations is provided to help children decipher the meaning of words which are more difficult to determine from context. Parents who watch the DVD with their children and discuss the onscreen action and vocabulary with them will greatly enhance the effectiveness of the DVD, and pick up valuable Spanish skills themselves.With Maria and Horge both speaking Spanish fluently, their accents are bang on to my untrained ear. They speak at a slower pace than a native speaker would in order to allow children to follow them, and often repeat words and phrases to encourage children to join in with responses. My two oldest girls were already chattering away from time to time with the disc on it's second play through.The DVD menu provides options to play the disc through, put the disc on auto play, or play only the song segments. No scene selection option is provided, though with a 30-minute disc that isn't a hardship.I've been teaching my six-year-old the five-star rating system; when I asked her how she'd rateSpanish for Beginners: Adentro y Afuera (Inside and Out) she replied, ""Six stars, I'd give it eight if I could."" The natural humour, infectious joy, and enthusiasm contained on the DVD have already made it a much-requested favourite in our home. My six-year-old has asked for it four times today (I had to stop her or she would have kept going.) It's just this sort of repetition in an immersive language experience that will help build a solid foundation for future studies in Spanish.Whether you want to give your children a taste of Spanish for National Hispanic Heritage Month (Sept. 15-Oct 15, 2009), supplement a more traditional language program, or use the Spanish for Beginners series as the first step in a full-immersion course of study, Adentro y Afuera (Inside and Out) is well worth your investment in time and money.Video clips of every Spanish for Beginners DVD can be found at [...]",5,Spanish Immersion Made
