1132816,A38QX8P4F7MKJ0,B0011UNB04,Mr. Dude Man,"[53, 54]","March 11, 2002. Six months to the day have passed since the terrorist attacks, and many Americans feel that the world is hopelessly overrun by hatred and violence. We're looking for something to remind us of beauty, kindness, love. Like always, we watch television, and I for one have made it a point to watch the new episode of 'Once and Again' tonight. For months ABC has been batting it around the schedule, much as a house cat does with a dead mouse that it still finds slightly amusing. Now the series appears to have an actual timeslot again. This is fortunate for fans of the show, because everything between now and the series finale is payoff.All the core cast members are back in fine form. Shane West really comes into his own, and Susanna Thompson will be famously robbed of an Emmy for pulling off a demanding transformation of her Karen that would have been impossible with a lesser performance. Julia Whelan and Evan Rachel Wood emerge as the two best actors of their generation, playing off each other in scenes that resonate like music because of what they are able to do. Sela Ward is never better than here, as Lily Sammler, anchoring the series as the young matriarch of the blended family at the center of a sublime circus of people and events. There are also unforgettable guest appearances by Eric Stoltz, Mischa Barton, Saul Rubinek, Patrick Dempsey and, yes, Ally Sheedy. One expects the occasional standout performance in a dramatic series, but seldom are so many this good at the same time. Nuance, originality, and authenticity become commonplace.There is worthy material to be covered, with screenplays from a rotating lineup of writers who seem to have been assigned their episodes by omniscient masterminds who knew exactly what they needed out of each. Echoes of previous episodes ring through the house on Oak Street, the halls of Upton Sinclair High School, and the other interior spaces that have become familiar. When the unlikely happens (Lily's new job, the plumber at Thanksgiving, or the snow plow, for example), there's a zany surrealism holding those scenes together, a sense of fun and whimsy that invites us to smile and follow along. The producers are winking as they set us up for what is to come and, when it does, we're fully invested; we're on the inside with these characters, and we'll go anywhere with them.Together, it's synergy. It swings for the bleachers and never lets up. As the final episodes resolve some conflicts, rest some on uneasy plateaus, and scatter fragments of others over an expansive blast area, the viewer is left with the feeling that there aren't real answers, there aren't endings; there are only moments, but those moments can be real and very powerful, and we can find something there to better ourselves.That's what the third season of 'Once and Again' is about. It's about where you can go and what you can do with a dramatic series after you've spent two seasons meticulously developing its characters and story arc with the best scripts and actors that network television has seen in a long, long time. Free from most of the limitations that hobble lesser productions, it soars into new territory and crackles with verve and invention at key moments. Observe how the sexual energy between Jessie and Katie is developed. Mischa Barton finds the right notes here. Certain of Katie's desire, yet so awkward and sweet in how she reveals it, she gives a performance that rings true to the spirit of teenage love and its earnest passion for purity and ideals. The misinformed have sometimes dismissed that plot element as a ratings stunt and, while it may have been promoted as one in the week leading up to ""that scene,"" it doesn't play that way. Most series that exploit lesbian relationships for ratings don't earn the right, aesthetically and emotionally, to use the material that they're showboating. Here's a situation where it's done so well that it feels right, deserving, and never -- never -- cheap. This is the signature 'Once and Again' treatment of delicate issues, to approach with great care, compassion, and intelligence, and explore the real dramatic potential that lies beyond the reach of weaker writing and acting teams.Fans of the show know what I mean when I say that the March 11, 2002 episode is the crowning glory of the series. It contains the most beautiful, cathartic moment between two people that I've seen on TV. It came at a delicate time and really had an impact on viewers. Apparently, I am not alone in my regard for this particular scene; there are entire websites devoted to it and the relationship that centers around it.Believe it or not, there are several other third-season threads that are equally well done and potentially more powerful. The writers have much to say about the appropriateness of various kinds of interpersonal relationships, and how they build their case for each is a marvel to watch unfold. Depending on your background and situation, you may find that another of these is special to you in some way. You might feel it all the way down to your bones, and that's the kind of magic that dramatists fantasize about and work their entire careers trying to capture.So for 'Once and Again', the third and final season is the pinnacle. If a single season of a single television series ever deserved immortality on DVD, it is this one. I've been dreaming of it for six years.",5,The top of the mountain.,1204156800,"02 28, 2008",2008,5405,"['March', '11', '2002', 'Six', 'months', 'day', 'have', 'passed', 'terrorist', 'attacks',

1132817,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0011UNB04,Robert Moore,"[5, 5]","The worst thing about ONCE AND AGAIN getting cancelled was that it was getting better and better as it went along.  In my opinion, Season Two was better than Season One, and Season Three was better than Season Two.  One of the reason the show got so good was that Rick and Lily's families moved in together, following the marriage that ended Season Two.  The result was a host of great family story arcs.  The biggest change of all was the sudden ascendance of Evan Rachel Wood as one of the most compelling characters on the show.  In Seasons One and Two she had been very much in the background most of the time, but in Season Three she is given a major role.  We already knew that she had some typical teen problems as she struggled with anorexia.  In Season Three she struggles entering high school, finding ways to explore her many talents (Wood has a very fine singing voice, which is put on prominent display), finding new friends, and exploring her sexuality in surprising ways.  One of the biggest surprises is her increasingly intense relationship with a friend at school, played by Mischa Barton shortly before finding success on THE O.C.  One of the saddest things about the show ending was that we never got to see how Jessie and Katie's relationship would have played out, and especially how the family members would have reacted.  The irony was that Lily was concerned that Grace might be gay.  I loved the riskiness of dealing with a teen same-sex relationship.  The show was willing to take some risks.I also very much enjoyed Grace's arcs in Season Three.  She is very much a flawed soul, racked by personal insecurities that cause her to make a string of unfortunate decisions.  She undermines Jessie's efforts to get a role in the school Shakespeare play and makes other lamentable decisions.  She also has an unfortunate emotional involvement with a teacher, played superbly by Eric Stoltz.  Though neither of them do anything wrong, they develop feelings for one another that can only be described as inappropriate.  The whole arc is handled tastefully (just as Jessie and Katie's relationship is) and you can feel the conflict they both experience.  Both of these relationships (Grace/Mr. Dimitri and Jessie/Katie) represent ONCE AND AGAIN at its best.What I like about ONCE AND AGAIN is that it is a family drama that isn't, like the endless teen-oriented dramas on the WB and the CW.  You get shows like GOSSIP GIRL where the adults are thrown in almost as afterthoughts, or other shows where the adults behave in ways that are almost like you imagine teens think adults behave.  But ONCE AND AGAIN at no point, even in the arcs focusing on kids, feels like a teen drama.  The show also displays a rare intelligence in its writing.  The show does not often resort to clich&eacute; or hackneyed story, and often had some nicely fresh arcs.The only thing I really dislike about this series are the black and white ""asides,"" where character are interviewed away from the central action.  Sometimes these have a documentary feel.  Sometimes they have feel oddly disembodied, as if we have entered an astral plane of sorts.  Sometimes it feels like they are talking to a psychiatrist.  I just detest these digressions.  MY friend who is a huge ONCE AND AGAIN fan doesn't dislike them as much as I do, but agrees that they are exceedingly odd.  Interestingly, the one time these asides work is at the very end of the series finale, when the cast members are interviewed about their experience on the show and their feelings about it coming to an end.It is absurd that Season Three has never been brought out on DVD and that Seasons One and Two are out of print.  I have only been able to see this show thanks to one of my closest friends who not only has Seasons One and Two on DVD but who has recorded all of Season Three.  If not for her, I would not have been able to see the entire series.  She has for years been checking over and again whether ONCE AND AGAIN will ever be released Season Three on DVD.  Frankly, I would like to own my own copies of all three seasons.  So now I'm hoping for the whole thing to be issued/reissued on DVD.  It is a shame that this fine show was cancelled prematurely.  Now it is a shame that it isn't available at all.  Except through the kindness of friends.",5,The final season of a very good show that just kept getting better,1244332800,"06 7, 2009",2009,4315,"['worst', 'thing', 'ONCE', 'AND', 'AGAIN', 'getting', 'cancelled', 'was', 'was', 'getting', 'better', 'better', 'went', 'along', 'opinion', 'Season', 'Two', 'was', 'better', 'Season', 'One', 'Season', 'Three', 'was', 'better', 'Season', 'Two', 'One', 'reason', 'show', 'got', 'so', 'good', 'was', 'Rick', 'Lily', 'families', 'moved', 'together', 'following', 'marriage', 'ended', 'Season', 'Two', 'result', 'was', 'host', 'great', 'family', 'story', 'arcs', 'biggest', 'change', 'was', 'sudden', 'ascendance', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'one', 'most', 'compelling', 'characters', 'show', 'Seasons', 'One', 'Two', 'had', 'been', 'very', 'much', 'background', 'most', 'time', 'Season', 'Three', 'given', 'major', 'role', 'already', 'knew', 'had', 'typical', 'teen', 'problems', 'struggled', 'anorexia', 'Season', 'Three', 'entering', 'high', 'school', 'finding', 'ways', 'explore', 'many', 'talents', 'Wood', 'very', 'fine', 'singing', 'voice', 'put', 'prominent', 'display', 'finding', 'new', 'friends', 'exploring', 'sexuality', 'surprising', 'ways', 'One', 'biggest', 'surprises', 'increasingly', 'intense', 'relationship', 'friend', 'school', 'played', 'Mischa', 'Barton', 'shortly', 'finding', 'success', 'O.C', 'One', 'saddest', 'things', 'show', 'ending', 'was', 'never', 'got', 'see', 'how', 'Jessie', 'Katie', 'relationship', 'would', 'have', 'played', 'out', 'especially', 'how', 'family', 'members', 'would', 'have', 'reacted', 'irony', 'was', 'Lily', 'was', 'concerned', 'Grace', 'might', 'be', 'gay', 'loved', 'riskiness', 'dealing', 'teen', 'same-sex', 'relationship', 'show', 'was', 'willing', 'take', 'risks.I', 'also', 'very', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'Grace', 'arcs', 'Season', 'Three', 'very', 'much', 'flawed', 'soul', 'racked', 'personal', 'insecurities', 'cause', 'make', 'string', 'unfortunate', 'decisions', 'Jessie', 'efforts', 'get', 'role', 'school', 'Shakespeare', 'play', 'other', 'lamentable', 'decisions', 'also', 'unfortunate', 'emotional', 'involvement', 'teacher', 'played', 'superbly', 'Eric', 'Stoltz', 'do', 'anything', 'wrong', 'develop', 'feelings', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'inappropriate', 'whole', 'arc', 'handled', 'tastefully', 'just', 'Jessie', 'Katie', 'relationship', 'can', 'feel', 'conflict', 'experience', 'relationships', 'Grace/Mr', 'Dimitri', 'Jessie/Katie', 'represent', 'ONCE', 'AND', 'AGAIN', 'best.What', 'like', 'ONCE', 'AND', 'AGAIN', 'family', 'drama', ""n't"", 'endless', 'teen-oriented', 'dramas', 'WB', 'CW', 'get', 'shows', 'GOSSIP', 'GIRL', 'where', 'adults', 'are', 'thrown', 'almost', 'afterthoughts', 'other', 'shows', 'where', 'adults', 'behave', 'ways', 'are', 'almost', 'imagine', 'teens', 'think', 'adults', 'behave', 'ONCE', 'AND', 'AGAIN', 'point', 'even', 'arcs', 'focusing', 'kids', 'feels', 'teen', 'drama', 'show', 'also', 'rare', 'intelligence', 'writing', 'show', 'not', 'often', 'resort', 'clich', 'eacute', 'hackneyed', 'story', 'often', 'had', 'nicely', 'fresh', 'arcs.The', 'only', 'thing', 'really', 'dislike', 'series', 'are', 'black', 'white', 'asides', 'where', 'character', 'are', 'interviewed', 'away', 'central', 'action', 'Sometimes', 'have', 'documentary', 'feel', 'Sometimes', 'have', 'feel', 'oddly', 'disembodied', 'have', 'entered', 'astral', 'plane', 'sorts', 'are', 'talking', 'psychiatrist', 'just', 'detest', 'digressions', 'MY', 'friend', 'who', 'huge', 'ONCE', 'AND', 'AGAIN', 'fan', ""n't"", 'dislike', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'are', 'exceedingly', 'odd', 'Interestingly', 'one', 'time', 'asides', 'work', 'very', 'end', 'series', 'finale', 'when', 'cast', 'members', 'are', 'interviewed', 'experience', 'show', 'feelings', 'coming', 'end.It', 'absurd', 'Season', 'Three', 'never', 'been', 'brought', 'out', 'DVD', 'Seasons', 'One', 'Two', 'are', 'print', 'have', 'only', 'been', 'able', 'see', 'show', 'one', 'closest', 'friends', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'Seasons', 'One', 'Two', 'DVD', 'who', 'recorded', 'Season', 'Three', 'not', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'see', 'entire', 'series', 'years', 'been', 'checking', 'again', 'ONCE', 'AND', 'AGAIN', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'released', 'Season', 'Three', 'DVD', 'Frankly', 'would', 'like', 'own', 'own', 'copies', 'three', 'seasons', 'So', 'now', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'whole', 'thing', 'be', 'issued/reissued', 'DVD', 'shame', 'fine', 'show', 'was', 'cancelled', 'prematurely', 'Now', 'shame', ""n't"", 'available', 'kindness', 'friends']",N/A
