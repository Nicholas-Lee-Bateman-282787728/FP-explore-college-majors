This dvd is no exception as Joe and his drummer and bass player rip through a highly charged set of electric blues.My only personal gripe would be that they kind of drop the ball on the very last song, a cover of Jimi Hendrix' &#34;Have You Ever Been Experienced&#34;, in which they come close,but no cigar, to capturing the feel of the original version. Of course, Jimi being Jimi, I don't know if ANYONE could really replicate the feel of that song. Don't get me wrong, it's not a deal-killer by any means, and everything else on this dvd is well worth the cost of admission. I would advise anyone wanting these Tour de Force dvds to get them individually,rather than in the 4-pack set I've seen advertised on many different sites. There are no differences in the content of the 4-pack and the one-offs, except that the 4-pack will cost you significantly more for putting all 4 dvds together in a simple cardboard box.

1667669,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00EL6NWB8,M. Oleson,"[3, 3]","In the spring of 2013 guitar wiz Joe Bonamassa set out to play 4 nights in London.  No big deal right?  Well this was 4 nights with 4 different sets of musicians playing 4 different play lists at 4 different venues.  His first night out was at a small (200 seats) club called The Borderline.  The stage was tiny, barely enough to hold Bonamassa, bass player Michael Rhodes and drummer Anton Fig.  Some may recognize Fig as the house drummer on Dave Letterman's Late Show.  I believe I'm correct in saying Bonamassa started out with a trio playing blues jams and that's what we get here.  And like everything I've seen Bonamassa do so far, he's as good as ever.It took me a while to get settled in but the group really begins to click with ""Pain and Sorrow,"" ""Happier Times,"" and ""Steal Your Heart Away"" during the middle section.  I also have a fondness for ""Burning Hell,"" a John Lee Hooker song.  The trio wrap things up with the famous Jimi Hendrix number, ""Are You Experienced?""  Joe is an obvious follower of Hendrix.This Blu ray package includes a killer DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track and you will want to turn it up...way up.  The video is top notch as well and must have been exceptionally difficult to film in this small setting.  Still director Philippe Klose and producer Kevin Shirley do a great job with the logistics and the set selection.  The concert itself runs 93 minutes and there is another hour or so of bonus features including ""No Man's Land"" (a behind the scenes look), ""The Making of Tour de Force"" (part 1) and ""All Access Pass"" (photo collection of The Borderline).",5,(BLU RAY REVIEW) 4 1/2 stars for a blues laden jam,1385424000,"11 26, 2013",2013,1592,"['spring', '2013', 'guitar', 'wiz', 'Joe', 'Bonamassa', 'set', 'out', 'play', '4', 'nights', 'London', 'No', 'big', 'deal', 'right', 'Well', 'was', '4', 'nights', '4', 'different', 'sets', 'musicians', 'playing', '4', 'different', 'play', 'lists', '4', 'different', 'venues', 'first', 'night', 'out', 'was', 'small', '200', 'seats', 'club', 'called', 'Borderline', 'stage', 'was', 'tiny', 'barely', 'enough', 'hold', 'Bonamassa', 'bass', 'player', 'Michael', 'Rhodes', 'drummer', 'Anton', 'Fig', 'may', 'recognize', 'Fig', 'house', 'drummer', 'Dave', 'Letterman', 'Late', 'Show', 'believe', ""'m"", 'correct', 'saying', 'Bonamassa', 'started', 'out', 'trio', 'playing', 'blues', 'jams', 'what', 'get', 'here', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Bonamassa', 'do', 'so', 'far', 'as', 'good', 'ever.It', 'took', 'while', 'get', 'settled', 'group', 'really', 'click', 'Pain', 'Sorrow', 'Happier', 'Times', 'Steal', 'Your', 'Heart', 'Away', 'middle', 'section', 'also', 'have', 'fondness', 'Burning', 'Hell', 'John', 'Lee', 'Hooker', 'song', 'trio', 'wrap', 'things', 'up', 'famous', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'number', 'Are', 'Experienced', 'Joe', 'obvious', 'follower', 'Hendrix.This', 'Blu', 'ray', 'package', 'killer', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '5.1', 'track', 'will', 'want', 'turn', 'up', 'way', 'up', 'video', 'top', 'notch', 'as', 'well', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'exceptionally', 'difficult', 'film', 'small', 'setting', 'Still', 'director', 'Philippe', 'Klose', 'producer', 'Kevin', 'Shirley', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'logistics', 'set', 'selection', 'concert', '93', 'minutes', 'hour', 'so', 'bonus', 'features', 'including', 'Man', 'Land', 'scenes', 'look', 'Making', 'Tour', 'de', 'Force', 'part', '1', 'Access', 'Pass', 'photo', 'collection', 'Borderline']",Tour De Force: Live In London - The Borderline

When I first saw these ""coming"" at my local record store (yes I'm lucky to have one near me Fingerprints in Long Beach CA) I thought, why bother putting out 4 videos from 4 shows on the same tour... and it struck me as overkill or as one review thought a runaway ego.  Yesterday I picked them all up and noted that they are 4 shows, 4 different bands, 4 venues and 4 concepts..They are all great and for different reasons, but they all share things in common, great visuals, great sound, great playing and great value for money. All come with 28 page booklets full of excellent pictures and information and all come with bonus features about the shows that are consecutive in nature (4 part making of that ads about an hour to each BR/DVD!).Favorite moments for me are Joe's treatment of the late Gary Moore's ""Midnight Blues"" both on his Blues night at Shepards Bush and his night at The Royal Albert Hall. Jeff Becks ""Spanish Boots"" from the trio/Borderline show is also worth the price on its own! From the first show which features his TRIO days sound to the blues w/horns at Shepards Bush to the Rock show at Hammersmith and the final big night at the Royal Albert Hall these shows (ranging from 1 hour and 40 minutes to over 2 hours each) are wonderful expressions of a love of music by one of this generations greatest guitarists and for me to have this much classic Les Paul guitar playing is heaven.I'd caution folks who think its too much, what would you give to have the same treatment by Gary Moore? Eric Clapton? heck...instead of highlights from the CREAM Reunion , what about a BR disc for every night? Complete? Would you want this from Peter Green at his best? Of course. I think that an artist like Joe Bonamassa who is certainly at a creative peak and has music and ideas flying off his fingers should capture as much of this as possible before he's too darned tired or burned out!!!You can view each individual show to see if there is a song or set list that has more appeal to you. Personally I am in the mood for rock sometimes, blues with horns other times, trio work others, so I'll return to these depending and I'm glad I have all 4.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",5,Guitar heaven is RIGHT....

There's maybe 2 or 3 hundred people crammed into this place. A very small intimate setting. Sound is OK but nothing stellar like some of his other work. Playing is typical Joe. Real good. Rhodes and Fig put forth good performances too. Picture quality is fine. Hard not to capture everything here as the stage is probably 10 x 15 feet. They play tunes you don't hear on his other releases. It's just a couple of amps and a basic drum kit. But these guys whale and have a great time. 5.1 DTS HD is kinda lame cause there's nothing in the rears to record. Occasional audience noise is about it.

I am such a huge fan, having all his albums, DVD's and have seen him five times in concert so I can kind of review this with some knowledge of his work.  First of all, I love seeing him in jeans, t-shirt and jacket - relaxed and happy (although he looks great in Armani too).  This DVD is to me reminiscent of &#34;Live at the Rockpalast&#34; which I think was the idea - his early work - raw, gritty, unpolished, earthy and powerful.  Every song is unbelievably heartfelt and true to his style.  His version here of &#34;Blues Deluxe&#34; is the best I've ever heard of his on any album, although his live performance of this in Chicago was awesome.  &#34;Pain and Sorrow&#34; - a song I haven't heard much - is perfection here and I was so glad to hear the original lyrics put back in &#34;Steal Your Heart Away&#34; - one of my favorite songs of his.  The highlight of this DVD to me is &#34;Burning Hell&#34;.  I never thought Joe could outdo Joe on his version of this song at the Rockpalast, but he does here.  He has so much fun doing this song, it's heartwarming.  &#34;The River&#34; is slide guitar heaven.  &#34;Story of a Quarryman&#34; is superb and the three of them performing &#34;Are You Experienced?&#34; is riveting.  Joe's whole heart and soul is in this performance and Anton and Michael back him up beautifully.
