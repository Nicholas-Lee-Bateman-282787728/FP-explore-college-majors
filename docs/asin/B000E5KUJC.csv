I saw it frankly because the movie seemed like the runt of the litter -- underappreciated, only screening for one day -- and because I needed an excuse to listen to a bunch of Johnny Cash songs I already knew too well.Well, my hunch was right.  This movie is a quiet pleasure, full of illicit love, melodrama, and great music.  Apart from a patch near the end that looks so bizarre compared to the rest of the flick that it had to have been reshot later in a studio, the natural photography is great and sets a lyrical mood.One can see why this movie has been neglected, because it's simple and not showy, but it's a well-told tale, and hopefully DVD will bring it to a new audience.",4,Fine drama with a fine score,1139097600,"02 5, 2006",2006,800,"['remember', 'seeing', 'WALK', 'LINE', 'year', 'two', 'ago', 'John', 'Frankenheimer', 'retrospective', 'New', 'York', 'Film', 'Forum', 'saw', 'frankly', 'movie', 'seemed', 'runt', 'litter', 'underappreciated', 'only', 'screening', 'one', 'day', 'needed', 'excuse', 'listen', 'bunch', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'songs', 'already', 'knew', 'too', 'well.Well', 'hunch', 'was', 'right', 'movie', 'quiet', 'pleasure', 'full', 'illicit', 'love', 'melodrama', 'great', 'music', 'Apart', 'patch', 'end', 'so', 'bizarre', 'compared', 'rest', 'flick', 'had', 'have', 'been', 'reshot', 'later', 'studio', 'natural', 'photography', 'great', 'lyrical', 'mood.One', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'movie', 'been', 'neglected', 'simple', 'not', 'showy', 'well-told', 'tale', 'hopefully', 'DVD', 'will', 'bring', 'new', 'audience']",I Walk the Line

Harvey ""Cricket ,country music and a go...","[10, 10]","Not to be confused with the much lauded-and righly so-Johnny Cash biopic ""Walk the Line"" this is a gritty slice of downbeat country noir that has much going for it but ultimately becomes a rather gruelling exercise for audiencesGregory Peck stars as dour but honest Tennessee backwoods sheriff Henry Tawes ,stuck in a  routine marriage and feeling his life slipping by .He falls head over heels in love with nubile teenager Alma McCain (Tuesday Weld)a decision that proves to have disastrous consequences .Her father -played by Ralph Meeker is the local moonshine baron ,and he ruthlessly exploits Taws obsession with his daughter to compel him to turn a blind eye to his moonshine operation ,and to make sure the Federal agents do the same thing .Things escalate when McCain senior murders Peck's deputy (Charles Durning)and forces Peck to help cover up the crime .From there things move to an ending marked by the  type of inevitability associated with Greek tragedyThe movie is superbly well acted and all the principals acquit themselves splendidly .I must single out Tuesday Weld for special mention however .In my opinion no actress ever has suggested amorality and sensuality so well in US cinema and it is a pity she never really brought this unique gift to more mainstream roles .She nails the accent to perfection as she does the dumb innocence and the sensuous somewhat amoral creature lurking beneath this veneer .Special mention also to Estelle Prsons as Tawes' pathetic and clinging wife and strong cameos from Durning and Bellamy add weight to proceedings ,backing up Peck' sterling work in the lead roleJohnny Cash contibutes 5 songs to the soundtrack and they help establish the bleak ,haunting mood of the piece and form an emotional commentary to events on screen .The whole movie feels and looks authentic in its sobriety and grittiness ,and yet herein lies my chief caveat .It is just too downbeat to be actually entertaining and even the bleakest peice needs some lightening of the mood which we sismply do not get here ,It is as if the makers of the movie have ignored the need of spectators to be entertained and for this reason I mark it down slightly.It is still a powerful and emotional piece of work -country noir as bleak as the best country songs are and conveying a similar emotional kick",3,Country noir,1192579200,"10 17, 2007",2007,2319,"['Not', 'be', 'confused', 'much', 'lauded-and', 'righly', 'so-Johnny', 'Cash', 'biopic', 'Line', 'gritty', 'slice', 'downbeat', 'country', 'noir', 'much', 'going', 'ultimately', 'rather', 'gruelling', 'exercise', 'audiencesGregory', 'Peck', 'dour', 'honest', 'Tennessee', 'backwoods', 'sheriff', 'Henry', 'Tawes', 'stuck', 'routine', 'marriage', 'feeling', 'life', 'slipping', '.He', 'falls', 'head', 'heels', 'love', 'nubile', 'teenager', 'Alma', 'McCain', 'Tuesday', 'Weld', 'decision', 'have', 'disastrous', 'consequences', '.Her', 'father', '-played', 'Ralph', 'Meeker', 'local', 'moonshine', 'baron', 'ruthlessly', 'Taws', 'obsession', 'daughter', 'compel', 'turn', 'blind', 'eye', 'moonshine', 'operation', 'make', 'sure', 'Federal', 'agents', 'do', 'same', 'thing', '.Things', 'escalate', 'when', 'McCain', 'senior', 'murders', 'Peck', 'deputy', 'Charles', 'Durning', 'forces', 'Peck', 'help', 'cover', 'up', 'crime', 'things', 'move', 'ending', 'marked', 'type', 'inevitability', 'associated', 'Greek', 'tragedyThe', 'movie', 'superbly', 'well', 'acted', 'principals', 'acquit', 'splendidly', '.I', 'must', 'single', 'out', 'Tuesday', 'Weld', 'special', 'mention', 'however', '.In', 'opinion', 'actress', 'ever', 'suggested', 'amorality', 'sensuality', 'so', 'well', 'US', 'cinema', 'pity', 'never', 'really', 'brought', 'unique', 'gift', 'more', 'mainstream', 'roles', '.She', 'accent', 'perfection', 'dumb', 'innocence', 'sensuous', 'somewhat', 'amoral', 'creature', 'lurking', 'beneath', 'veneer', '.Special', 'mention', 'also', 'Estelle', 'Prsons', 'Tawes', 'pathetic', 'clinging', 'wife', 'strong', 'cameos', 'Durning', 'Bellamy', 'add', 'weight', 'proceedings', 'backing', 'up', 'Peck', 'sterling', 'work', 'lead', 'roleJohnny', 'Cash', '5', 'songs', 'soundtrack', 'help', 'establish', 'bleak', 'haunting', 'mood', 'piece', 'form', 'emotional', 'commentary', 'events', 'screen', '.The', 'whole', 'movie', 'feels', 'authentic', 'sobriety', 'grittiness', 'yet', 'herein', 'chief', 'caveat', '.It', 'just', 'too', 'downbeat', 'be', 'actually', 'entertaining', 'even', 'bleakest', 'peice', 'lightening', 'mood', 'sismply', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'here', 'makers', 'movie', 'have', 'ignored', 'need', 'spectators', 'be', 'entertained', 'reason', 'mark', 'down', 'slightly.It', 'still', 'powerful', 'emotional', 'piece', 'work', '-country', 'noir', 'as', 'bleak', 'best', 'country', 'songs', 'are', 'conveying', 'similar', 'emotional', 'kick']",I Walk the Line

This was another spur of the moment buy, and again I wasn't disappointed.

They're both manipulative and decitful, but she's the more ""honest"" in only trying to help her family.  On the other hand, Peck's character is just downright creepy, with some deep-seated control freak issues that just compresses him more and more.

968454,A2UUYORVIZ00UH,B000E5KUJC,Noirdame,"[2, 2]","Not to be confused with the 2005 Johnny Cash biopic ""Walk The Line"", this 1970 film directed by John Frankenheimer tells the story of a middle-aged, small-town sheriff, Henry Tawes (Gregory Peck) , who finds himself becoming increasingly disillusioned with his life as a husband and father, and coming to resent his humdrum existence. It could also be argued that he is entering a mid-life crisis, and one day, he stops the daughter of a local moonshiner (played by Ralph Meeker), pretty Alma McCain (Tuesday Weld) and her younger brother for driving without a permit. Captivated by her beauty, he begins a secret affair with her, all the while turning a blind eye to her family's illegal activities. Things become increasingly out of hand as inspectors begin to investigate the goings on in town and Henry's devious deputy (Charles Durning) discovers the liaison and the McCain family's profession. Henry also finds his distraught wife (Estelle Parsons) has also discovered the affair, and he decides to throw all caution to the wind and run away with Alma. Torn between her affection for Henry and her loyalty to her family, Alma's choice and Henry's recklessness result in tragedy and heartbreak.This movie was very much overlooked when it was first released, but it is a good flick and the performances are superb. The production was shot mainly on location in Tennessee and Johnny Cash provides the soundtrack. This role was a very different one for Gregory Peck, especially at this stage of his career, but he embodies the tightly-wound sheriff expertly. Tuesday Weld is convincing and captivating as a young woman caught in a way of life that not only limits her opportunities but also her choices. Used by her father to keep Henry smitten in order to keep the family business secret, she makes the only choice she feels she can make, but not without cost to Henry.Columbia released the movie on DVD a few years back, and it is unforgivably very bare-bones (there isn't even a menu), but it is in widescreen and the transfer looks wonderful, capturing the bleak yet lush countryside.If you're a fan of Gregory Peck and Tuesday Weld, this is a film that must be viewed.",5,Underrated and Neglected Little Masterpiece,1358553600,"01 19, 2013",2013,2175,"['Not', 'be', 'confused', '2005', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'biopic', 'Line', '1970', 'film', 'directed', 'John', 'Frankenheimer', 'story', 'middle-aged', 'small-town', 'sheriff', 'Henry', 'Tawes', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'who', 'becoming', 'increasingly', 'disillusioned', 'life', 'husband', 'father', 'coming', 'resent', 'humdrum', 'existence', 'could', 'also', 'be', 'argued', 'entering', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'one', 'day', 'daughter', 'local', 'moonshiner', 'played', 'Ralph', 'Meeker', 'pretty', 'Alma', 'McCain', 'Tuesday', 'Weld', 'younger', 'brother', 'driving', 'permit', 'Captivated', 'beauty', 'secret', 'affair', 'while', 'turning', 'blind', 'eye', 'family', 'illegal', 'activities', 'Things', 'become', 'increasingly', 'hand', 'inspectors', 'begin', 'investigate', 'goings', 'town', 'Henry', 'devious', 'deputy', 'Charles', 'Durning', 'liaison', 'McCain', 'family', 'profession', 'Henry', 'also', 'distraught', 'wife', 'Estelle', 'Parsons', 'also', 'discovered', 'affair', 'throw', 'caution', 'wind', 'run', 'away', 'Alma', 'Torn', 'affection', 'Henry', 'loyalty', 'family', 'Alma', 'choice', 'Henry', 'recklessness', 'result', 'tragedy', 'heartbreak.This', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'overlooked', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'good', 'flick', 'performances', 'are', 'superb', 'production', 'was', 'shot', 'mainly', 'location', 'Tennessee', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'soundtrack', 'role', 'was', 'very', 'different', 'one', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'especially', 'stage', 'career', 'tightly-wound', 'sheriff', 'expertly', 'Tuesday', 'Weld', 'convincing', 'captivating', 'young', 'woman', 'caught', 'way', 'life', 'not', 'only', 'opportunities', 'also', 'choices', 'Used', 'father', 'keep', 'Henry', 'smitten', 'order', 'keep', 'family', 'business', 'secret', 'only', 'choice', 'can', 'make', 'not', 'cost', 'Henry.Columbia', 'released', 'movie', 'DVD', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'unforgivably', 'very', 'bare-bones', ""n't"", 'even', 'menu', 'widescreen', 'transfer', 'wonderful', 'capturing', 'bleak', 'yet', 'lush', 'countryside.If', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'Tuesday', 'Weld', 'film', 'must', 'be', 'viewed']",I Walk the Line

968459,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B000E5KUJC,Wuchak,"[1, 1]","Not to be confused with the 2005 biopic of Johnny Cash, 1970's ""I Walk the Line"" stars Gregory Peck as a taciturn Appalachian sheriff who suffers a mid-life crisis and falls head-over-heels in love with some pretty young thing (Tuesday Weld), the daughter of a local moonshine baron. The sheriff turns a blind eye for obvious reasons and everything's fine, until others find out and his redneck deputy interferes with the ""arrangement.""WHAT WORKS:- First of all, how can you go wrong with Gregory Peck? Although I've only seen about a dozen of his movies over the years he's always been an unvoiced favorite of mine. He's tall, noble, masculine, likable, determined and just has an unshowy star quality. Here he plays his usual self with the exception that, facing his mid-life crisis, he makes the wrong choices and hurts everyone involved (more on this below).- Tuesday Weld was 26 years-old during filming and is easy on the eyes. Her character in the story maintains a naive quality even though what she does is totally wrong. I suppose you could say she's more ignorantly amoral than immoral.- The film was shot in the beautiful Appalachian hills of North-central Tennessee. The courthouse square scenes were shot in Gainesboro, but the dam scene that opens the movie was shot at Center Hill Dam. The Drive-In movie sequence where they are watching the 1969 Jerry Lewis movie ""Hook, Line and Sinker"" was shot at the Green Hills Drive-in in Carthage (hometown of Al Gore), about 45 minutes from Gainesboro. During the production Gregory Peck, Tuesday Weld, director John Frankenheimer and other cast and crew stayed at the Holiday Inn in Cookeville, TN. All the buildings in Gainsboro are still there (including the pool hall) except the first store that the sheriff went in to that was cattycorner to the courthouse, which was torn down. A small portion of the film was also shot in Northern California, in a little town called Colusa, the seat of Colusa County, but I can't tell which specific scenes. Much of Colusa's architecture has a very Southern influence and has been featured in a number of movies.- I like the moral of the story: One's actions have a ripple effect -- wrong choices will inevitably hurt not only you but those linked to you, just as right choices bless you and others.- On that same note, the film effectively shows how a powerful man can be reduced to the strength of a loaf of bread simply by unwisely falling prey to the temptation of some young cutie.- If you like Johnny Cash this film's a must; it features a handful of his songs.WHAT DOESN'T WORK:- The story plays out in an ultra-realistic manner like other films of the 60s and 70s before the brainless ""blockbuster"" came into vogue. This isn't a negative to me because I actually prefer realism but others might not appreciate it, especially the flat vibe of of the first act, but the story picks up steam in the second act and holds till the end.- Some don't like the film because the usually-noble Peck is playing a sad and lonely adulterer. This is against type and perhaps explains why Peck took the part; he was 53 at the time and likely saw the role as a challenge. Here was an opportunity to play a character who is neither a hero nor anti-hero, a character who feels trapped by routine and meaninglessness, who makes a desperate and ill-fated attempt to drag himself out by means of his desire for a (much) younger woman, the one thing that makes him feel alive again. Peck rose to the challenge admirably but this naturally has the negative effect of stirring anger in the viewer since the sheriff's wife couldn't have been more loving and devoted yet he comes off aloof and uncaring, barely even acknowledging his precious 11 year-old daughter, not to mention the domino-effect problems he willingly shackles himself to in the third act.[SPOILER ALERT! Don't read this paragraph unless you've seen the film] It's not clear at the end if the sheriff (Peck) dies or not. Yes, he's clearly wounded by the metal hook, but the climax doesn't ever show him falling over dead. I would hope that, at this point, he came to his senses and goes back to restore his relationships with his wife & daughter and never entertains another thought of adultery (assuming he wasn't mortally wounded, of course). Does anyone have any insights about this? [END SPOILER].FINAL WORD: ""I Walk the Line"" is one of those 'hidden gems' in cinema, a really good film that was never acknowledged and seems to have been lost over time. It's along the lines of the contemporaneous ""Deliverance"" albeit without the sexual perversion and more on the dramatic side, less the adventure.
