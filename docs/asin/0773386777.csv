I remember watching this movie when I was just a little girl, it was an addiction, and obsession, we had it on tape and I must have watched it weekly.

Whenever I asked any of my friends if they remembered the movie with Fairuza Balk and Tim Curry in it that was a lot like Harry Potter they looked at me like I had 6 heads.  One day however this VHS just happened to show up on my recommendations and I was ecstatic, and purchased it immediately!While the quality of the VHS is fair, the special affects compared to today are the worst, but honestly what can you expect of a childrens movie made in 1986?

I languished in the Muppet Treasure Island for Tim Curry. I stayed awake for the entire duration of Charlie's Angels for Tim Curry. I slogged through every last frame of Congo for Tim Curry. I EVEN survived McHale's Navy for Tim Curry -- and for this I should receive bonus Curry-fan brownie points because in order to get my fix, I had to also get a mad, protracted splash of Tom Arnold. I'm not trying to brag about my intestinal fortitude here, I just want you all to understand the depths of my love, that's all.I believe -- from the bottom of my black little heart -- that Tim Curry is the great stage and screen villain of our time. There is no role so stupid that he can't make it sinister. There is no part so hackneyed that he can't make it enjoyable to watch. There is no voiceover so poorly-written that he can't turn it into warm, gooshy sex-lube for the ears. And yes, I am well aware that there is also no script so terrible that he won't consider it -- but in my rather unbalanced opinion, this only adds to his charm.So a few weeks ago, my boyfriend made a post referencing a little-known Curry classic of potentially epic badness. A lesser fan might have cringed and clicked through the madness ... but not I. No, I ran over to amazon.com and tracked down a copy of The Worst Witch. Finally, my bold ""I can watch anything with Tim Curry"" stance was challenged.Wow. Just ... wow.  In short, and all besotted Tim Curry affection aside, this is -- and I say this as a woman who actually watched House of the Dead without grabbing her Blockbuster card and gouging her eyes out -- possibly the worst hour and a half in the history of entertainment.  Rent it if you must -- but skip the film at all costs.  The DVD offers you the option of simply watching the ""music video"" (God, I wish I could use heavier quotes).  Go and watch the ""music video.""For you see, thought of Tim breaking spontaneously into song is a rather pleasant one, really, so I got all excited about the prospect of an imbedded video; but what I had not been accurately warned about was the fact that this song is accompanied by eight minutes of what can only be described as pure, distilled graphic manipulation hell. No, really. If Satan himself sat down with a Commodore 64 and The Buggles ... he might have been able to come up with something almost as bad as the music video that is embedded in this movie. Maybe.But at least it's funny, and you can hold it up as the Worst Thing Ever Filmed.

Like Mildred, I was also bullied by some of the more popular kids in my class so I greatly sympathized with her. I especially liked her little friend Maud Warlock who stood by Mildred even when everybody else was laughing at her.Mildred Hubble, played by Fairuza Balk, is a young girl, (probably about ten or eleven) in her first year at Miss Cackle's Academy for Witches. While the other first years are progressing at the ""average"" rate, Mildred is at the bottom of the class, as everything she touches seems to turn to dust, even though she tries her best. Ethel Hollow, the youngest sister in a family of high acheivers, is at the other end of the spectrum, receiving the highest grades so far, the favorite of the teachers, and unfortunately, a trouble maker for Mildred. One of my favorite parts of the movie is when Mildred turns Ethel into a pig, even though she was supposed to turn her into a frog! Personally, I think the pig was much better suited to the character! LOL!On Halloween, Ethel's meaness goes too far when she frames Mildred for messing up the Broomstick Formation, a presentation for the Grand Wizard to showcase the talents of the first year witch students. Poor Mildred and her little gray and white kitten, Tabby, flee the school, only to run into Miss Cackle's evil sister, hell bent on taking over her sister's operation!I won't give away the end, but this, I think, definitely the predecessor for Harry Potter. True, the speical effects might look cheesy today, but hey, for 1986, I think they did the best that they could at the time. Remember people, computer animation was still very much in its infancy!

But I'm sure that children and adults will love this fun classic film based on the popular books by Jill Murphy. It was also made into a popular and fun TV series.I mainly adore and love the cast: Fairuza Balk (Return To Oz/The Craft) as Mildred Hubble, Diana Rigg as Miss Hardbroom, Charlette Rae (The Facts Of Life) as Miss Cackle and as her evil sister Agatha, Anna Kipling as Ethel Hallow, Danielle Batchelor as Maud Warlock (Mildred's best friend) and most of all my all time favorite Tim Curry as The Grand Wizard who does a fun singing performance of a Halloween number!I was really excited to see this finally arrive on DVD.

23861,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,0773386777,Monty Moonlight,"[70, 70]","Imagine if ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" was made in the mid-eighties, for television, with almost no budget. Also, imagine the hero is a misfit young witch rather than a wizard prodigy, attending an all-girl school for witchcraft. Replace Maggie Smith with Diana Rigg, Richard Harris with Mrs. Garrett from ""Facts of Life,"" and Lord Voldemort with... Mrs. Garrett from ""Facts of Life,"" and you have the 1986 classic television Halloween special, ""The Worst Witch.""Fairuza Balk plays Mildred Hubble, the absolutely worst witch at Miss Cackle's International Academy for Witches. No matter how hard she tries, Mildred screws up everything, from her potions to her broomstick flying, and being tormented by school bully Ethel Hallow doesn't help her any either. As Halloween approaches, Mildred does her best to improve, especially at flying, knowing that this year's Halloween guest of honor will be the Grand Wizard himself! To her joy, Mildred manages to make her way onto the team of students who will fly in formation for the Grand Wizard's visit. Sadly, good ol' Ethel manages to make Mildred look bad again, and right in front of the Grand Wizard (Tim Curry). Her heart broken, Mildred gathers her belongings and her cat, Tabby, and sets out to run away the following morning, but encounters a group of evil witches plotting in the woods as she makes her getaway. Now, Mildred will have to face her fears and conquer her low self-esteem if she is going to save her friends and school from Miss Cackle's wicked sister, Agatha, and her plot to take over!Despite the no-budget special effects, Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer-like plot, campy...everything, and a disturbing Halloween night music video performance by Tim Curry himself, ""The Worst Witch"" is an annual must-watch film at the very least! In fact, it is because of all those reasons, and the fantastic cast, that this film should not be overlooked! It is the best at being the worst! As enjoyable as a cheesy Halloween special can be, and as cheesy as a cheesy Halloween special can be! I'm so glad this is finally on DVD and wish ""The Night Dracula Saved the World"" (AKA ""The Halloween That Almost Wasn't"") would follow suit. I'm dying to see that ol' chestnut again! If you're a fan of Halloween and have strong feelings for 80's childhood nostalgia, if you are a die-hard Tim Curry or Fairuza Balk fan, or if you just want to know what Harry Potter would have been like on a shoe-string TV budget, ""The Worst Witch"" is a must see! Based on the popular children's books by Jill Murphy, ""The Worst Witch"" was more recently revitalized through a TV series (that I've yet to see) which is also available here on Amazon, but for your first look at Mildred Hubble, make sure you see this Fairuza Balk/Tim Curry classic! The Curry video alone is worth the price! Also highly recommended: The Harry Potter film series, ""Hocus Pocus,"" ""The Night Dracula Saved the World,"" ""The Witches,"" ""Bewitched,"" ""Return to Oz,"" the Casper film series, ""Labyrinth,"" and ""The Wizard of Oz.""Extra info about the DVD: While it is great to finally have this classic on DVD, it was clearly produced on a budget to equal the film itself, relatively speaking. The picture quality is about the same as the VHS (without VHS problems), and some DVD players might not play the film properly. For example, I can't play this at all on my Samsung player. However, it should be noted that, in my experience, Samsung players stink and won't play an awful lot of DVDs, and I need to replace my player at the first opportunity. The DVD probably plays fine on most other stuff. It plays perfectly on my family's Sony. Anyway, in addition to that, there are 3 extra feature sections. Two are run of the mill text extras: Cast Bios and Cast Trivia. The third is something to be more aware of, especially if you buy this DVD for your children. The third text extra (actually, on the menu it is the first) is basically a brief schooling on Wicca. That's right, not the fantasy, Harry Potter style witchcraft of the film, but several pages of basic info on various spells, tools one needs (including a dagger), etc... Yeah, shocking and inappropriate for this particular DVD, since the film is about Halloween style witchery, not the Wicca religion. So, there's the information, just so you parents can be aware and decide for yourselves whether or not to buy the DVD without an unpleasant surprise. As an adult who grew up with this children's classic, the extras are not a problem for me to ignore, but I can see how some parents would be very concerned to find such information on a DVD they've bought for their small children. If this is a problem for you and you don't think talking to your kids about it will be enough (or controlling the remote), I recommend seeking out the VHS version. The film by itself is such a wonderful treat that it would be a shame for them to miss it!",5,The Spirit of Halloween Past for Children of the `80s!,1131062400,"11 4, 2005",2005,4916,"['Imagine',
