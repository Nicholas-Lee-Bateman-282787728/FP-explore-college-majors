However, this is far from what you'd expect. It's about a taxi driver who picks up various people, most of them are Hollywood stars, and they talk about problems. It's not a bad movie and it's well acted but I wish they would have choosen a different title for the movie. They also say it takes on one day which is the longest of the year but it seems days pass before the movie ends. A minor problem but it is worth watching at least once.",3,Hellcab,1260921600,"12 16, 2009",2009,577,"['just', 'saw', 'film', 'pile', 'other', 'unknown', 'dvds', 'liquidation', 'store', 'horror', 'film', 'vein', 'Bone', 'Collector', 'However', 'far', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'taxi', 'driver', 'who', 'up', 'various', 'people', 'most', 'are', 'Hollywood', 'stars', 'talk', 'problems', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'well', 'acted', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'choosen', 'different', 'title', 'movie', 'also', 'say', 'one', 'day', 'longest', 'year', 'days', 'pass', 'movie', 'minor', 'problem', 'worth', 'watching', 'least', 'once']",Hell Cab

It's a film about a guy working as a cabbie having a bad day.At first, I almost stopped watching it because I thought it was about his passengers. They just are not all that unusual really. They are just people caught up in their own lives and it is not pretty. What makes it interesting is that it gets to him. He is not immune or numb to it.It's about how he feels and his situation. It's kind of subtle and not a standard Hollywood product. I am glad I saw it.This film is advertised as ""Starring Gillian Anderson, Laurie Metcalf and John Cusack"". That is a lie. It stars Paul Dillon.

Film consists of a series of vignettes--as it should, because that's the cab business, the way it is for any cabbie: people get in, people get out--and most you never see again (if you're a cab driver in any big city.)And yet, this is what hurts the movie. The actors are not to blame, because this is one amazing cast; neither are the directors (there were two; it was co-directed) it comes down to the writing.The reason Scorcese's Taxi Driver works as well as it does (for the most part) is because the DeNero character did a lot more than just drive around New York dealing with abnoxiius and/or insane fares; there was an actual storyline that went somewhere and took the audiance along for the duration of the ride.",4,Where to?,1214956800,"07 2, 2008",2008,762,"['way', 'know', 'Film', 'series', 'vignettes', 'should', 'cab', 'business', 'way', 'cabbie', 'people', 'get', 'people', 'get', 'out', 'most', 'never', 'see', 'again', ""'re"", 'cab', 'driver', 'big', 'city', 'yet', 'movie', 'actors', 'are', 'not', 'blame', 'one', 'amazing', 'cast', 'are', 'directors', 'were', 'two', 'was', 'co-directed', 'down', 'writing.The', 'reason', 'Scorcese', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'part', 'DeNero', 'character', 'did', 'lot', 'more', 'just', 'drive', 'around', 'New', 'York', 'dealing', 'abnoxiius', 'and/or', 'insane', 'fares', 'was', 'actual', 'storyline', 'went', 'somewhere', 'took', 'audiance', 'duration', 'ride']",Hell Cab

Also known as ""Chicago Cab,"" and based on the play of that name, Hellcab is one of those flicks that follows around a cab driver (Paul Dillon, a fantastic actor who looks like Flea, sounds like Flea two octaves lower, is as well-cast as Flea in the highly-underrated Dudes... well, you get the idea) as he picks up fares and wanders in and out of the lives of the passengers. Tight, funny, high-pitched. Small parts from Gillian Anderson, John Cusack (also one of the film's producers), and best actress 2000 nominee Julianne Moore in the kind of scene that makes us realize why she could be nominated for best actress.

878827,A3JTBJC5WSEZ7Q,B00079HZSY,Thomas M. Sipos,"[5, 12]","Don't be misled by the title, cover art, or log line: ""Dare You Pay The Fare?"" HELLCAB is not a horror film.HELLCAB is a boring art film (and normally, I love indie/art films). It's about the depressing day in the life of a Chicago cabby. Each passenger gets one or two minutes of screen time, including ""star"" Gillian Anderson, who struggles with an Italian blue-collar accent.Film is a series of vingettes; nothing is ever resolved. We see the passenger, their situation set up, then go on to the next passenger.  I kept waiting for a story to gel, but there is no story.  And no point other than: see how depressing this guy's life is?  Yes, it is.  This is not a pleasant or fun film to watch.  Nor is it engaging or involving.  We feel sorry of the cabbie, but don't particularly like (or dislike) him.HELLCAB has a few strong moments (the rape victim, the architect, the sleazeball played by the always talented John C. Reilly) but not enough to make this cab ride worth it.According to the credits, HELLCAB was based on a play.  I suppose they put some chairs on stage with the actor in the driver's seat, and other actors coming in and out.A much better film about cabbies is DRIVEN (not to be confused with the Sly Stallone film of the same name).  DRIVEN has its depressing moments, but it has fully fleshed, memorable characters, with interesting story arcs.Curiously, both HELLCAB and DRIVEN occur around Christmas time, and use that to contrast the cabbies' depressed lives with the joyous yuletide lights.",2,"Misleading cover art for a depressing ""slice of life""",1116633600,"05 21, 2005",2005,1519,"['Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'misled', 'title', 'cover', 'art', 'log', 'line', 'Dare', 'Pay', 'Fare', 'HELLCAB', 'not', 'horror', 'film.HELLCAB', 'boring', 'art', 'film', 'normally', 'love', 'indie/art', 'films', 'depressing', 'day', 'life', 'Chicago', 'cabby', 'passenger', 'one', 'two', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', 'including', 'star', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'who', 'Italian', 'blue-collar', 'accent.Film', 'series', 'vingettes', 'nothing', 'ever', 'resolved', 'see', 'passenger', 'situation', 'set', 'up', 'then', 'go', 'next', 'passenger', 'kept', 'waiting', 'story', 'gel', 'story', 'point', 'other', 'see', 'how', 'depressing', 'guy', 'life', 'Yes', 'not', 'pleasant', 'fun', 'film', 'watch', 'engaging', 'involving', 'feel', 'sorry', 'cabbie', 'do', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'like', 'dislike', 'him.HELLCAB', 'few', 'strong', 'moments', 'rape', 'victim', 'architect', 'sleazeball', 'played', 'always', 'talented', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'not', 'enough', 'make', 'cab', 'ride', 'it.According', 'credits', 'HELLCAB', 'was', 'based', 'play', 'suppose', 'put', 'chairs', 'stage', 'actor', 'driver', 'seat', 'other', 'actors', 'coming', 'out.A', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'cabbies', 'DRIVEN', 'not', 'be', 'confused', 'Sly', 'Stallone', 'film', 'same', 'name', 'DRIVEN', 'depressing', 'moments', 'fully', 'fleshed', 'memorable', 'characters', 'interesting', 'story', 'arcs.Curiously', 'HELLCAB', 'DRIVEN', 'occur', 'Christmas', 'time', 'use', 'contrast', 'cabbies', 'depressed', 'lives', 'joyous', 'yuletide', 'lights']",Hell Cab
