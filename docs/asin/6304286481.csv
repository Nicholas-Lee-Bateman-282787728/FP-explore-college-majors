411637,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6304286481,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","I love the fact that Tom Cruise passed on this, solely because I didn't know that while I was watching the film and the whole time I kept thinking that Michael J. Fox reminded me of a young Tom Cruise.  His mannerisms, charisma, delivery; everything just felt very much like 80's Tom Cruise.  That is not a bad thing.  Think what you will of Mr. Cruise, but he certainly draws in your eye.Jay McInerney broke out in the 80's as one of those young, tortured writers who exploited his own vices through the printed page.  He was friends with Bret Easton Ellis (that should say a lot) and so his books were met with the same amount of intrigue and caution.  He just went for it.  I have not read `Bright Lights, Big City', but I have a feeling that this big screen adaptation is a lot lighter in tone and is cushioned so as not to be too forthright.  Look at what they did to Ellis's own `Less Than Zero' the year before.  Gutted it and made it a Lifetime movie.  `Bright Lights, Big City' feels like it is mellowed out.  Still, there is some great moments here (`Less Than Zero' had a few itself) and so it shouldn't be avoided altogether, despite many considering it forgettable entertainment.The cast is rather impressive.  Michael J. Fox makes the most of a mature role and really nails some vital scenes (his longwinded drunk rant about his wife is perfection) and his narration (which bookends the film) is spot on.  The film is stolen by Kiefer Sutherland though.  His arrogant, self-centered yet manipulative best friend Tad is a sensational scene stealer, especially in the film's earlier moments.  He slides through his dialog with ease and never once flinches an acting muscle.  He just IS.Still, the pacing has issues and there are segments in the film's core that feel empty and unnecessary.  The idea that Jamie is throwing his life away in nights of debauchery with coke and booze is lightened to such a point that the audience never really gets into the thrust of his decline.  It feels sugarcoated.  Maybe it was the studios really aching to get a crowd or maybe it was the star not wanting to look too immoral, but the depictions of drug use never feel gritty enough.  While we can feel his despair and depression, it is based on outside influences (his mother, his wife) and not directly related to the powder going up his nose.It is worth a gander, but it doesn't say what it wants to say and that is a shame.",3,The city should have been darker...,1374624000,"07 24, 2013",2013,2426,"['love', 'fact', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'passed', 'solely', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'watching', 'film', 'whole', 'time', 'kept', 'thinking', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'reminded', 'young', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'mannerisms', 'charisma', 'delivery', 'everything', 'just', 'felt', 'very', 'much', '80', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'Think', 'what', 'will', 'Mr.', 'Cruise', 'certainly', 'eye.Jay', 'McInerney', 'broke', 'out', '80', 'one', 'young', 'tortured', 'writers', 'who', 'exploited', 'own', 'vices', 'printed', 'page', 'was', 'friends', 'Bret', 'Easton', 'Ellis', 'should', 'say', 'lot', 'so', 'books', 'were', 'met', 'same', 'amount', 'intrigue', 'caution', 'just', 'went', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'Bright', 'Lights', 'Big', 'City', 'have', 'feeling', 'big', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'lot', 'lighter', 'tone', 'cushioned', 'so', 'not', 'be', 'too', 'forthright', 'Look', 'what', 'did', 'Ellis', 'own', 'Less', 'Than', 'Zero', 'year', 'before', 'Gutted', 'made', 'Lifetime', 'movie', 'Bright', 'Lights', 'Big', 'City', 'feels', 'mellowed', 'out', 'Still', 'great', 'moments', 'here', 'Less', 'Than', 'Zero', 'had', 'few', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'avoided', 'altogether', 'many', 'considering', 'forgettable', 'entertainment.The', 'cast', 'rather', 'impressive', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'most', 'mature', 'role', 'really', 'nails', 'vital', 'scenes', 'longwinded', 'drunk', 'rant', 'wife', 'perfection', 'narration', 'film', 'spot', 'film', 'stolen', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'arrogant', 'self-centered', 'yet', 'manipulative', 'best', 'friend', 'Tad', 'sensational', 'scene', 'stealer', 'especially', 'film', 'earlier', 'moments', 'dialog', 'ease', 'never', 'once', 'acting', 'muscle', 'just', 'IS.Still', 'pacing', 'issues', 'are', 'segments', 'film', 'core', 'feel', 'empty', 'unnecessary', 'idea', 'Jamie', 'throwing', 'life', 'away', 'nights', 'debauchery', 'coke', 'booze', 'lightened', 'point', 'audience', 'never', 'really', 'thrust', 'decline', 'sugarcoated', 'Maybe', 'was', 'studios', 'really', 'aching', 'get', 'crowd', 'maybe', 'was', 'star', 'not', 'wanting', 'look', 'too', 'immoral', 'depictions', 'drug', 'use', 'never', 'feel', 'gritty', 'enough', 'can', 'feel', 'despair', 'depression', 'based', 'outside', 'influences', 'mother', 'wife', 'not', 'directly', 'related', 'powder', 'going', 'up', 'nose.It', 'gander', ""n't"", 'say', 'what', 'say', 'shame']","Bright Lights, Big City VHS"

Fox in comedies like &quot;Back to the Future&quot; and I was absolutely  shocked to see him in this type of role. My innocent childhood hero looked  like a horrible person in this movie--because he portrayed a horrible  person. After watching this film, I vowed to never touch a drug in my life  and I keep that vow. Jamie Conway (Fox's character) is a cocaine snorting,  selfish, scary individual with serious problems who finally hits rock  bottom. It took me years before I was able to accept Fox in other roles  after being literally taken in by his performance. As far as entertainment  value, this film keeps you interested but it isn't for casually viewing  because you'll be feeling the power of it long after you watch and that  state of mind stays with you.

411641,A3BXS0A7CMJ1CJ,6304286481,linus,"[5, 8]","Over the space of three years, the reviled triumvirate of hot young (no longer young, these days) '80s New York novelists - Tama Janowitz (&quot;Slaves of New York&quot;), Bret Easton Ellis (&quot;Less Than  Zero&quot;), and Jay McInerney (&quot;Bright Lights, Big City&quot;) -  watched Hollywood turn their books into tepid movies. This adaptation is  probably the best of the three, due to a strong lead performance by Michael  J. Fox as protagonist Jamie Conway and a lively supporting cast. The movie  has an exciting title sequence, featuring a great-looking female bartender  with a shaved head, but swiftly loses energy from there. The book was a  vague celebration of the nouveau sex-and-drugs scene, with an undercurrent  of yearning for simplicity and wholesomeness; the movie, made smack dab in  the middle of the Just Say No era, fails to establish what would lure  people like Jamie, who now seems to get high solely to blot out the pain of  his mother's death and being dumped by Phoebe Cates. (At times the movie is  like an '80s remix of &quot;Looking for Mr. Goodbar.&quot;)The  coke-snorting, promiscuous Jamie was a stretch for the amiable Fox  (remember, at that point he was best known as Alex P. Keaton and Marty  McFly; the following year he would make &quot;Casualties of War&quot; and  discover that moviegoers preferred him in comedy). He gives the film  whatever core of feeling it has. But the coldness of the images (Gordon  Willis shot this as if he were still working on &quot;The Godfather&quot;)  numbs us to his plight. We don't know whether to take Jamie's flailings as  desperate comedy or as drama, and McInerney's own script is no help. The  novel, written in ironic second-person present tense, like a &quot;Choose  Your Own Adventure&quot; book for jaded teens (it begins, &quot;You are not  the kind of person who would be at a place like this at this time of the  morning&quot;), didn't exactly cry out for film adaptation in the first  place. The movie is inoffensive but pointless. Two stars, upgraded to three  for Fox and the cool '80s soundtrack featuring Donald Fagen, Bryan Ferry,  Prince, New Order, Depeche Mode, and others.BOTTOM LINE: For $10, Fox  fans can't go too far wrong.",3,Not terrible; worth it for Fox,964656000,"07 27, 2000",2000,2231,"['space', 'three', 'years', 'reviled', 'triumvirate', 'hot', 'young', 'longer', 'young', 'days', ""'80s"", 'New', 'York', 'Tama', 'Janowitz', 'quot', 'Slaves', 'New', 'York', 'quot', 'Bret', 'Easton', 'Ellis', 'quot', 'Less', 'Than', 'Zero', 'quot', 'Jay', 'McInerney', 'quot', 'Bright', 'Lights', 'Big', 'City', 'quot', 'watched', 'Hollywood', 'turn', 'books', 'tepid', 'movies', 'adaptation', 'probably', 'best', 'three', 'due', 'strong', 'lead', 'performance', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'protagonist', 'Jamie', 'Conway', 'lively', 'supporting', 'cast', 'movie', 'exciting', 'title', 'sequence', 'featuring', 'great-looking', 'female', 'bartender', 'shaved', 'head', 'swiftly', 'energy', 'there', 'book', 'was', 'vague', 'celebration', 'nouveau', 'sex-and-drugs', 'scene', 'undercurrent', 'yearning', 'simplicity', 'wholesomeness', 'movie', 'made', 'smack', 'dab', 'middle', 'Just', 'Say', 'No', 'era', 'establish', 'what', 'would', 'lure', 'people', 'Jamie', 'who', 'now', 'get', 'high', 'solely', 'blot', 'out', 'pain', 'mother', 'death', 'being', 'dumped', 'Phoebe', 'Cates', 'times', 'movie', ""'80s"", 'remix', 'quot', 'Looking', 'Mr.', 'Goodbar.', 'quot', 'coke-snorting', 'promiscuous', 'Jamie', 'was', 'stretch', 'amiable', 'Fox', 'remember', 'point', 'was', 'best', 'known', 'Alex', 'P.', 'Keaton', 'Marty', 'McFly', 'following', 'year', 'would', 'make', 'quot', 'Casualties', 'War', 'quot', 'discover', 'moviegoers', 'preferred', 'comedy', 'film', 'core', 'feeling', 'coldness', 'images', 'Gordon', 'Willis', 'shot', 'were', 'still', 'working', 'quot', 'Godfather', 'quot', 'numbs', 'plight', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'take', 'Jamie', 'flailings', 'desperate', 'comedy', 'drama', 'McInerney', 'own', 'script', 'help', 'novel', 'written', 'ironic', 'second-person', 'present', 'tense', 'quot', 'Choose', 'Own', 'Adventure', 'quot', 'book', 'jaded', 'teens', 'quot', 'are', 'not', 'kind', 'person', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'place', 'time', 'morning', 'quot', 'did', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'cry', 'out', 'film', 'adaptation', 'first', 'place', 'movie', 'inoffensive', 'pointless', 'Two', 'stars', 'upgraded', 'three', 'Fox', 'cool', 'soundtrack', 'featuring', 'Donald', 'Fagen', 'Bryan', 'Ferry', 'Prince', 'New', 'Order', 'Depeche', 'Mode', 'others.BOTTOM', 'LINE', '10', 'Fox', 'fans', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'too', 'far', 'wrong']","Bright Lights, Big City VHS"
