Just think of the great series, like Rod Serling's Twilight Zone and Night Gallery, or the 1980's Twilight Zone resurrection; how about Tales From the Darkside; or to some extent Tales From the Crypt [although not nearly as gory]--well Ghost Stories has similarities of all of these! Now, add the opening narration by Rip Torn, and episode specific intro and outro narration--again similar to The Twilight Zone or even The [more sci-fi oriented] Outer Limits, and you have MOST of the elements for a great anthology series.I say MOST because threre's one great difference between the above mentioned icon shows and Ghost Stories; the actors appearing in Ghost Stories are all mostly unknown, much like that of daytime soap operas. But that doesn't make this series weak at all. The performances are strong and convincing. The writing and teleplays are clever and to the point with many surprises, twists and turns, quite reminisint to another great series: Alfred Hitchcock Presents. The characters and storylines are well developed but not complicated [which usually makes or breaks such a series considering each episode is only about 20 minutes].The high production quality, and no-nonsense story-telling makes this an enjoyable viewing experience, episode after episode. Of course some episodes are better than others, but I have thoroughly enjoyed all 44 of them--unlike the [many versions of] The Twilight Zone and all of the series which have many outstanding episodes augmented with several clunkers. With Ghost Stories, the episodes compliment each other so that you come to expect a fairly simple, but decent supernatural plot with a lot of great ideas that makes you eager to see the next episode. There are some special effects where necessary, but for most of the stories, special effects aren't needed for a great story.It is interesting that this show was made for and played on the Fox Family Channel, as, in my opinion, most of these stories are not family oriented, that is, not suitable for, well at least pre-teens.  Perhaps this is what kept Ghost Stories from proceeding to become a longer running and more well known show. Oh well!By the way, this 6 DVD set is the only one you would want. There is a five disc set that excludes four episodes, and there are other single DVDs entitled Haunted: Ghost Stories. Apparently the parent company, Echo Bridge Entertainment bought and re-released these titles from Platinum Disc. This 6 disc set is well worth the price!

1193511,A3JTBJC5WSEZ7Q,B001G79DX6,Thomas M. Sipos,"[13, 13]","I loved this horror anthology when it was first syndicated in 1997. Back then, I taped it on Beta (yes, I know).I've since bought both the 40 episode DVD set, and then the 44 episode set (yes, a ripoff for selling the earlier set without all the episodes).This show has a low-budget, TV feel, which works well for TV horror.  A low budget forces the makers to focus on story and acting, rather than rely on special effects.(This show's special effects are the sort of 1990s computer CGI effects found on The New Outer Limits -- the effects LOOK like computer effects, which don't match the ""look"" of the live action shots.)The stories are pare for horror anthologies.  Some great and original tales, some so-so, some stale and dull.  The usual ""box of chocolates.""I disagree with another reviewer about the acting quality.  Unlike most TV horror anthologies, there are NO ""name actors"".  Not even any recognizable B actors.  Even so, I was especially impressed by the acting quality.  Many of the actors did excellent work.  Not all of them, but many.Let's clear this up: This show did NOT debut on the Fox Family channel, despite what it says on the DVD box.  It was syndicated in 1997.  I even have the show's press kit from back then, touting their upcoming second season (which was not to be).Maybe it appeared on the Fox Family Channel, but I suspect it was after its initial syndicated run.Finally, the 44 episode DVD edition says that it includes 4 ""never before seen"" episodes.  NOT TRUE.  The earlier set didn't include these 4 episodes.  And perhaps the Fox Family Channel didn't air them.  But they were included in the syndication run.  I SAW them, and I still have them on my Beta tapes of the show.Hardcore fans of low-budget, TV horror anthologies, who don't mind seeing many of the same old tropes (people who don't realize they're dead; greedy murderers or adulterers who get their comeupance, etc.), should enjoy this show.",5,Great horror anthology -- misleading marketing,1300752000,"03 22, 2011",2011,1941,"['loved', 'horror', 'anthology', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'syndicated', '1997', 'Back', 'then', 'taped', 'Beta', 'yes', 'know', '.I', ""'ve"", 'bought', '40', 'episode', 'DVD', 'set', 'then', '44', 'episode', 'set', 'yes', 'ripoff', 'selling', 'earlier', 'set', 'episodes', '.This', 'show', 'low-budget', 'TV', 'feel', 'well', 'TV', 'horror', 'low', 'budget', 'makers', 'focus', 'story', 'acting', 'rather', 'rely', 'special', 'effects', 'show', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'sort', '1990s', 'computer', 'CGI', 'effects', 'found', 'New', 'Outer', 'Limits', 'effects', 'LOOK', 'computer', 'effects', 'do', ""n't"", 'match', 'look', 'live', 'action', 'shots', 'stories', 'are', 'pare', 'horror', 'anthologies', 'great', 'original', 'tales', 'so-so', 'stale', 'dull', 'usual', 'box', 'chocolates', 'disagree', 'reviewer', 'acting', 'quality', 'most', 'TV', 'horror', 'anthologies', 'are', 'NO', 'name', 'actors', 'Not', 'even', 'recognizable', 'B', 'actors', 'Even', 'so', 'was', 'especially', 'impressed', 'acting', 'quality', 'Many', 'actors', 'did', 'excellent', 'work', 'Not', 'clear', 'up', 'show', 'did', 'NOT', 'debut', 'Fox', 'Family', 'channel', 'what', 'DVD', 'box', 'was', 'syndicated', '1997', 'even', 'have', 'show', 'press', 'kit', 'back', 'then', 'touting', 'upcoming', 'second', 'season', 'was', 'not', 'be', '.Maybe', 'appeared', 'Fox', 'Family', 'Channel', 'suspect', 'was', 'initial', 'syndicated', 'run.Finally', '44', 'episode', 'DVD', 'edition', '4', 'never', 'before', 'seen', 'episodes', 'NOT', 'TRUE', 'earlier', 'set', 'did', ""n't"", 'include', '4', 'episodes', 'perhaps', 'Fox', 'Family', 'Channel', 'did', ""n't"", 'air', 'were', 'included', 'syndication', 'run', 'SAW', 'still', 'have', 'Beta', 'tapes', 'show.Hardcore', 'fans', 'low-budget', 'TV', 'horror', 'anthologies', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'seeing', 'many', 'same', 'old', 'tropes', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', ""'re"", 'dead', 'greedy', 'murderers', 'adulterers', 'who', 'get', 'comeupance', 'etc', 'should', 'enjoy', 'show']",Ghost Stories Set
