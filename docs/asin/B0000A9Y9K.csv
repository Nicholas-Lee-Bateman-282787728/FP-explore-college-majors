762112,A3H82LUT1EC655,B0000A9Y9K,Erika Sorocco,"[6, 8]","With Christmas just a few days, everyone's favorite classic cartoon character, Strawberry Shortcake, has decided that it's time for her to choose some extra special Christmas presents for her extra special friends. So, with Honey Pie Pony in tow, she travels to a magical place called Holiday Land, to search for the perfect gifts, and she finds them. But when an unexpected incident involving a pile of melting snowballs ruins all of the presents that Strawberry Shortcake selected for her friends, she is forced to realize that the most important aspect of Christmas isn't giving presents, or even receiving them, but rather having friends to celebrate with.STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE was my absolute favorite cartoon when I was younger. So seeing her come back, especially in a holiday movie, I knew I had to have it. I must admit, it doesn't disappoint. BERRY MERRY CHRISTMAS features the classic cartoon character, along with all of her closest friends, and teaches children and adults of all ages a special lesson about Christmas, and the holidays all together, through a series of songs and adventures that they embark on, in this holiday movie. A must-have gift for all this year. Especially for those of us who grew up with the cute little red-haired girl named Strawberry Shortcake.Erika Sorocco",5,Fun Musical Adventure for All Ages,1070323200,"12 2, 2003",2003,1299,"['Christmas', 'just', 'few', 'days', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'classic', 'cartoon', 'character', 'Strawberry', 'Shortcake', 'decided', 'time', 'choose', 'extra', 'special', 'Christmas', 'presents', 'extra', 'special', 'friends', 'So', 'Honey', 'Pie', 'Pony', 'tow', 'magical', 'place', 'called', 'Holiday', 'Land', 'search', 'perfect', 'gifts', 'when', 'unexpected', 'incident', 'involving', 'pile', 'melting', 'snowballs', 'presents', 'Strawberry', 'Shortcake', 'selected', 'friends', 'forced', 'realize', 'most', 'important', 'aspect', 'Christmas', ""n't"", 'giving', 'presents', 'even', 'receiving', 'rather', 'having', 'friends', 'celebrate', 'with.STRAWBERRY', 'SHORTCAKE', 'was', 'absolute', 'favorite', 'cartoon', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'So', 'seeing', 'come', 'back', 'especially', 'holiday', 'movie', 'knew', 'had', 'have', 'must', 'admit', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'BERRY', 'MERRY', 'CHRISTMAS', 'classic', 'cartoon', 'character', 'closest', 'friends', 'teaches', 'children', 'adults', 'special', 'lesson', 'Christmas', 'holidays', 'together', 'series', 'songs', 'adventures', 'embark', 'holiday', 'movie', 'must-have', 'gift', 'year', 'Especially', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'cute', 'little', 'red-haired', 'girl', 'named', 'Strawberry', 'Shortcake.Erika', 'Sorocco']","Strawberry Shortcake - Berry, Merry Christmas"

We already owned Meet Strawberry Shortcake and Springtime for Strawberry Shortcake, and she watches them over and over and over again all day long. I find myself singing the songs in the shower! So, when I saw that there is now a Christmas movie, I had to get it for her! And I'm glad that I did because she loves it just as much as the other two. It is full of great Christmas scenery and catchy little Christmas songs (there is also a soundtrack to this movie that you can buy for all of the Christmas songs). The story is about Strawberry Shortcake and all of her friends at Christmas time. Strawberry finds herself stuck in the dilemma of what to get for each of her friends - she wants to get everyone the absolute PERFECT gift. All of the main characters are in this movie.  It's a must have for any Strawberry Shortcake fan!I'm kind of tired of hearing people saying that it doesn't live up to the Strawberry Shortcake of the past. I grew up watching and playing with the old Strawberry Shortcake, and although it has changed slightly, it is only a little bit in a appearance. They are better quality and a little bit more modernized... so what??? I don't understand what the big deal is. And it's not like little girls now even know the difference, so who cares? They are great movies! Especially this one!
