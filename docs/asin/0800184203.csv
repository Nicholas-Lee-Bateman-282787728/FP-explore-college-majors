I was quite surprised by how much I liked it. Not because it was sexy but because it was funny. The main thing this flick has going for it is that it didn't take itself seriously. Ving Rhames, who I always love, did a superb job playing a no BS bodyguard. Burt Reynolds was hilarious. And Demi? Well, she got naked. That's about all I can say for her. The story was hugely predictable, and the acting was pretty bad, but this movie was really funny. There were some great one-liners. The best line of the movie was one of Ving's: ""Nico: What are you, nuts?! Shad: Yeah, psycho. Delusions of invincibility combined with a strong homicidal urge. I have a kick-your-ass fetish."" Rent it with the guys, drink a few beers, have a few laughs. It's not as bad as you might think.",4,"Surprisingly Good!

In other words, a real human being. Her ex-husband is a piece of crap, yes, but not the cartoonish lout we see in the film. Really, everyone in a Hiaasen novel is a bit of a goofball, once their foibles are looked at unflinchingly, which is part of the fun.Those only familiar with &quot;Strip Tease&quot; via the movie don't get any of that: The good guys are too good to screw up, and the bad guys are too stupid to have any redeeming qualities. And to top it all off, Demi apparently doesn't understand that stripping is meant to titillate, not spiritually enlighten its audience. Those aroused by the film ought to get out more.In fact, the book tops the film in every way, with the possible exception of what Burt Reynolds brings to the film. But even then, in his role as a corrupt politician -- and, ultimately, the engine for the story -- punches are pulled and he's not quite as sleazy as in the book. Apparently, giving people a lesson into how greed is destroying the Everglades was just too heavy for the film audience.Those who liked the film -- and they exist, strangely enough -- still ought to pick up the book, to learn all about the characters and read the situations that didn't make the final cut. For current fans of Hiaasen's work, the book is roughly on par with &quot;Stormy Weather,&quot; although much more politically barbed than that work, which took aim at humanity's folly generally.And for Demi Moore, what were you thinking? You owe Carl and his fans a big apology, as well as your own fans, who deserve better.",2,"Forget the movie, read the book",976060800,"12 6, 2000",2000,1914,"['not', 'Carl', 'Hiaasen', 'best', 'novel', ""'d"", 'nominate', 'quot', 'Skin', 'Tight', 'quot', 'quot', 'Native', 'Tongue', 'quot', 'quot', 'Strip', 'Tease', 'quot', 'far', 'wiser', 'funnier', 'richer', 'anemic', 'film', 'version', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'would', 'have', 'believe.Instead', 'FBI', 'secretary-turned-stripper', 'Erin', 'being', 'strangely', 'desexualized', 'perfect', 'being', 'novel', 'complicated', 'mess', 'other', 'words', 'real', 'human', 'being', 'ex-husband', 'piece', 'crap', 'yes', 'not', 'cartoonish', 'lout', 'see', 'film', 'Really', 'everyone', 'Hiaasen', 'novel', 'bit', 'goofball', 'once', 'foibles', 'are', 'looked', 'unflinchingly', 'part', 'fun.Those', 'only', 'familiar', 'quot', 'Strip', 'Tease', 'quot', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'good', 'guys', 'are', 'too', 'good', 'screw', 'up', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'too', 'stupid', 'have', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'top', 'off', 'Demi', 'apparently', ""n't"", 'understand', 'stripping', 'meant', 'titillate', 'not', 'spiritually', 'enlighten', 'audience', 'aroused', 'film', 'ought', 'get', 'out', 'more.In', 'fact', 'book', 'film', 'way', 'possible', 'exception', 'what', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'film', 'even', 'then', 'role', 'corrupt', 'politician', 'ultimately', 'engine', 'story', 'punches', 'are', 'pulled', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'sleazy', 'book', 'Apparently', 'giving', 'people', 'lesson', 'how', 'greed', 'destroying', 'Everglades', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'heavy', 'film', 'audience.Those', 'who', 'liked', 'film', 'exist', 'strangely', 'enough', 'still', 'ought', 'pick', 'up', 'book', 'learn', 'characters', 'read', 'situations', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'final', 'cut', 'current', 'fans', 'Hiaasen', 'work', 'book', 'roughly', 'par', 'quot', 'Stormy', 'Weather', 'quot', 'much', 'more', 'politically', 'barbed', 'work', 'took', 'aim', 'humanity', 'folly', 'generally.And', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'what', 'were', 'thinking', 'owe', 'Carl', 'fans', 'big', 'apology', 'as', 'well', 'own', 'fans', 'who', 'deserve', 'better']",N/A

Her dancing is truly a show that will cause men to stick bills of higher denomination in her garter. The supporting cast of strippers is also very good, including a few women whose mammary endowment is something that could knock you out if they swung around at even a moderate rate of rotation. However, that is the only thing even remotely positive about this movie. The plot is thin and some of the male characters are dumber than owl excrement.Demi plays a mother where her ex-husband has custody of their infant daughter. The only job that she can get that pays enough is to strip at a club called ""The Eager Beaver."" The ex-husband steals wheelchairs from hospitals by putting on hospital scrubs, the daughter in the chair and walking out the door. The ex-husband's sister and her husband live in one of the ugliest and dirtiest trailers ever to appear in a movie. However, the dumbest male role in this movie and quite possibly the dumbest in the history of cinema was played by Burt Reynolds. His character is a congressman so stupid that you wouldn't want him to even drive a bus or clean the subways in D. C. for fear that it would be contagious.The ending is so preposterous that my impression was that the writers just wanted to put something together to end the movie so they could go on to more interesting work.

I would say that except for a collapse at the end, this film does capture the essence and spirit of the movie.  And that's not an easy thing to do.  Carl Hiaasen's novel about the topless business in Florida walked a very fine line.  On one hand, just about everyone but Erin, played very well by Demi Moore, was portrayed as a loser to some degree under the biting pen of the author.  Yet he told a story that made these characters seems realistic.The movie does  a much better job than I thought could be done with the subtle attitude of the story.  A lot of the reviews I've seen show that the reviewers who saw it just don't get it.  Yes, most of the characters are dumb and or evil, but they are done so in a sly, elegant manner.  Just about every character in the movie nails the book, except Stuart Pankin's dull portrayal of the sleazy lawyer.There are two factors that keep it from five-star territory.  First, Hollywood does wimp out on the ending.  One of the fine things Hiassen does while keeping his characters funny is also to make some of them realistically dangerous.  These are nasty people, and while there is death in the movie, there was a lot more in the book.  Were they thinking of making a sequel?The other factor, and I have to be a stickler about it, is that the book portrayed a nude club, and there's just not enough shots of the ladies the way I'd like to see them.

The latter comes from Demi Moore who plays Erin Grant, the FBI secretary - losing her job and the custody over her daughter to no good small time crook wheelchairs stealing husband (Robert Patrick looking and acting like a stoned, redneck version of Gary Oldman) and who takes a job as an exotic dancer in the local club ""Eager Beaver"" to earn money for her court appeal. In the club she becomes the hottest attraction and meets many...interesting characters, the most colorful being, of course Congressman David Dilbeck (Burt Reynolds) who ""just loves naked women. It's a character flaw"" and who is absolutely smitten by Erin. Erin also makes friends with a club bouncer, Shad (Ving Rhames) who is perhaps the best thing in the movie - clever, sharp, sarcastic, with the great sense of humor. One scene where Shad tells to Dilbeck's bodyguards that Meryl Streep used to work in ""Eager Beaver"" as an exotic dancer and they seem to believe him is brilliant. If only everything had been as good as he was we would've had a really great movie. What do we have now? Well, Demi Moore looks really good with the minimum clothes on. I mean, the woman was a 33 year old mother of three at the time and her body was marvel to behold. I just think that she was too serious, intense, and solemn doing the striptease numbers - after all it is not only strip it is tease, too. It goes to her acting in the movie in general. Reynolds seemed to have a lot of fun with his sleazy drunk Congressman David Dilbeck, election-day choice of Christian groups and a lot of laughs comes from his mannerism and quotes. There are plenty of laughs, actually, in ""Striptease"" but quite often they seem like the wrong and unintentional type for the movie material.Who had the best laugh? I'd guess, Demi Moore did after been paid $12.5 million - one of the highest paychecks for an actress back then.2.5/5",2,Good or bad? Funny or ridiculous?

I found the story to be plausible, but the bad acting and choppy story flow left much to be desired.  From what I understand, this movie was originally set as a drama, but it was turned into comedy for the sake of mass appeal.  If it was a drama it would have made a little more sense.Demi Moore plays Erin, a single mom who is looking to make ends meet and keep custody of her daughter.  Like a lot of desperate women with no education or skills, she turns to the pole.  She's a likeable gal despite the sleaze and desperation a job and enviornment like this constitutes, and is completely drug free as well.  (Now we're talking fiction!)  Burt Reynolds, in the only true comic relief in this movie, is a senator who's a little off his meds one day when he sees Erin dancing and becomes obsessed with her, providing the one and only plot movement to see what will happen once they see each other again.  And there's some crime or something that they witness in between and there's a twist in it.  Or something.THis was a vehicle for showing us Demi's buff and tumble body.  I admit, I hope I will look like her at age 40, let alone after one, let alone after THREE children.  And perhaps she wanted to make us a little jealous, but now I have every reason to be jealous since she's married to Ashton Kutcher 15 years her junior.  Still, it's a weak movie.

166334,A16GM9G38VTJMV,0800184203,RedConOne,"[0, 0]","This movie is actually pretty funny. Its acting makes it hard to take it serious even at parts that in any other movie would be serious points. In this film Demi Moore plays Erin Grant a recently divorced mother who is unemployed from her desk job with the FBI. In a unfair custody ruling her criminal ex-husband gets custody of their daughter. In order to pay for the appeal Erin starts working at The Eager Beaver which is a strip club. Her problems proceed to get worse as a crooked politician falls head over heels for her and begins to romantically pursue her. As Erin finds herself wondering deeper and deeper into troubled waters she must make risky decisions to protect herself, her daughter, and their future together.Striptease is a good movie, its not real high quality acting but i tend to believe that is intentional due to it is the only time i have ever seen some of the actors give such a 'unique' performance. It has plenty of funny moments and one liners where you get a decent laugh. It won't make you laugh until you cry but they will be decent laughs. This is a good popcorn movie that is enjoyable to watch. Its not going to gross you out, its not going to scare you, or keep you on the edge of your seat in suspense. The plot is fairly predictable and easy to guess what will happen next. It will however offer decent entertainment to those who are willing to lower their nose and give it a chance.The nudity in my opinion deserves its own paragraph. If your planning on buying this for the nudity then be warned you may be slightly disappointed while there is a good amount of it i wouldn't consider much of it extremely good. If your a Demi fan then you will love it because this is the only film i know of that she bares as much as she does in this film. There is plenty of nudity but i agree with the review written by The Hawk that the casting department did a good job making Demi one of the better looking girls in the movie.I also agree with The Hawk on the statement that this movie does attempt to change some social stereotypes that plague strippers and related professions. Being someone who knows two strippers and also knowing a few women in the adult film industry i was happy to see a movie that tries to show that strippers are people and are just as human as anyone else. Many people forget that about strippers and in related fields (adult film industry) that the women in those occupations are still people who feel all the same emotions that the rest of us feel. It was nice to see a film that tries to show that they are not evil people but are just people.This film is really funny and is fun to watch. It is not a movie to that will leave much of a long lasting impression on you. Meaning you it won't really change how you look at life. Other than what i mentioned above, it might make you realize strippers and women in related professions are not evil people. This is not a twisting thriller or a complex puzzle like Courage Under Fire it is just something that will entertain you with quirky acting, funny lines, and decent nudity.To sum it up Striptease is a pretty good movie for the value. I give it 4/5 stars it is pretty good and a fun popcorn movie that is fun to watch over and over.",4,Not a bad movie,1349827200,"10 10, 2012",2012,3241,"['movie', 'actually', 'pretty', 'funny', 'acting', 'hard', 'take', 'serious', 'even', 'parts', 'other', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'serious', 'points', 'film', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'Erin', 'Grant', 'recently', 'divorced', 'mother', 'who', 'unemployed', 'desk', 'job', 'FBI', 'unfair', 'custody', 'ruling', 'criminal', 'ex-husband', 'custody', 'daughter', 'order', 'pay', 'appeal', 'Erin', 'working', 'Eager', 'Beaver', 'strip', 'club', 'problems', 'proceed', 'get', 'worse', 'crooked', 'politician', 'head', 'heels', 'romantically', 'pursue', 'Erin', 'wondering', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'troubled', 'waters', 'must', 'make', 'risky', 'decisions', 'protect', 'daughter', 'future', 'together.Striptease', 'good', 'movie', 'not', 'real', 'high', 'quality', 'acting', 'i', 'tend', 'believe', 'intentional', 'due', 'only', 'time', 'i', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'actors', 'give', ""'unique"", 'performance', 'plenty', 'funny', 'moments', 'one', 'liners', 'where', 'get', 'decent', 'laugh', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'cry', 'will', 'be', 'decent', 'laughs', 'good', 'popcorn', 'movie', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'not', 'going', 'gross', 'out', 'not', 'going', 'scare', 'keep', 'edge', 'seat', 'suspense', 'plot', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'easy', 'guess', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next', 'will', 'however', 'offer', 'decent', 'entertainment', 'who', 'are', 'willing', 'lower', 'nose', 'give', 'chance.The', 'nudity', 'opinion', 'own', 'paragraph', 'planning', 'buying', 'nudity', 'then', 'be', 'warned', 'may', 'be', 'slightly', 'disappointed', 'good', 'amount', 'would', ""n't"", 'consider', 'much', 'extremely', 'good', 'Demi', 'fan', 'then', 'will', 'love', 'only', 'film', 'i', 'know', 'as', 'much', 'film', 'plenty', 'nudity', 'i', 'agree', 'review', 'written', 'Hawk', 'casting', 'department', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'making', 'Demi', 'one', 'better', 'looking', 'girls', 'movie.I', 'also', 'agree', 'Hawk', 'statement', 'movie', 'attempt', 'change', 'social', 'stereotypes', 'plague', 'strippers', 'related', 'professions', 'Being', 'someone', 'who', 'two', 'strippers', 'also', 'knowing', 'few', 'women', 'adult', 'film', 'industry', 'i', 'was', 'happy', 'see', 'movie', 'show', 'strippers', 'are', 'people', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'human', 'anyone', 'else', 'Many', 'people', 'forget', 'strippers', 'related', 'fields', 'adult', 'film', 'industry', 'women', 'occupations', 'are', 'still', 'people', 'who', 'feel', 'same', 'emotions', 'rest', 'feel', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'film', 'show', 'are', 'not', 'evil', 'people', 'are', 'just', 'people.This', 'film', 'really', 'funny', 'fun', 'watch', 'not', 'movie', 'will', 'leave', 'much', 'long', 'lasting', 'impression', 'Meaning', 'wo', ""n't"", 'really', 'change', 'how', 'look', 'life', 'Other', 'what', 'i', 'mentioned', 'might', 'make', 'realize', 'strippers', 'women', 'related', 'professions', 'are', 'not', 'evil', 'people', 'not', 'twisting', 'thriller', 'complex', 'puzzle', 'Courage', 'Fire', 'just', 'something', 'will', 'entertain', 'quirky', 'acting', 'funny', 'lines', 'decent', 'nudity.To', 'sum', 'Striptease', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'value', 'give', '4/5', 'stars', 'pretty', 'good', 'fun', 'popcorn', 'movie', 'fun', 'watch']",N/A

166344,APRZ2IVM8JTLV,0800184203,The Mysterious Traveler,"[2, 3]","STRIPTEASE (1996) Written and Directed by Andrew Bergman. Based on the book by Carl Hiassen. Some songs by Joan Jett and Annie Lennox. Score by Howard Shore. Luscious cinematography by Stephen Goldblatt.Starring Demi Moore, Burt Reynolds, Ving Rhames, Robert Patrick, Paul Guilfoyle and Armand Assante.Demi Moore plays a former secretary for the F.B.I. who, because of her slimy criminal White Southern ex Husband, loses both her job and the custody of her daughter. So, in an attempt to get her daughter back on appeal, Moore becomes a popular stripper at the Eager Beaver while at the same time becoming involved with a murderous, psychopathic, sexually degenerate Congressman and fending off her brutal ex.On one hand, one supposes, that this film is wildly offensive. Besides making concerted bigoted attacks on White Southerners and on Christians, the film is a raving hate screed on the Republican Party portraying them as being little more that a gigantic Death Squad led by Hispanics and sexual degenerates. It is ironic that the whole situation including the sexual predatory politico and the Hispanic death squads was obviously the situation in Bill Clinton's Arkansas simply transplanted to Florida and renamed. Of special passing interest is that all the Republican criminal behavior is set in Broward County--almost as if Hollywood were laying the groundwork for what nearly took place in 2000. HOWEVER, on the other hand, other than in passing, none of this is of any real importance what so ever.What IS important is whether a film starring Demi Moore called STRIPTEASE delivers the goods?And it does.Between the various attempts by the Democrats to reach out to the Stripper community and their customers, on an average of every five to six minutes, the viewer is presented with a variety of stripteases by all of Demi's friends(with names like Ariel Sharon and Urbanna Sprawl) and several high-powered ones by the Demster herself. When the Demster is not stripping in front of an audience, she is practicing her technique while flouncing about the house in a towel, running about holding a gun while wearing a nice white boa and corset ensemble with white leather knee high boots, taking her young daughter swimming in a nearby beach wearing a bikini and going through a wide variety of tight T-shirts and halter tops. THAT is what is important here. Bergman is to be commended for his insight into what the film is all about. So successful is he that this viewer would support a whole series of films about strippers fighting the Evil Republican Party. If Demi is unavailable, perhaps they could get Nikki Cox(as Moore's now grown up daughter stripping to put herself through dental school), Jennifer LOOOOVVVVEEE Hewitt(as a Feminist Operative infiltrating the Republican owned strip dens), Neve Campbell (as a shy inhibited Catholic girl who can only find freedom when she strips in front of a large group of drunks) and Denise Richards as Trixie--the conscience of the piece. I smell trilogy.Though the film has a hideous reputation, it actually is more than watchable. If one approaches it for it's deep insight into various sociopolitical issues then perhaps one might be a tad disappointed but to repeat this is a Demi Moore movie called STRIPTEASE---not PRIMARY COLORS or THE CIDER HOUSE RULES so get a grip.The plot--basically an excuse--is more than serviceable for what is required. The film is hardly dull with the odd clever line and a few impressive non-Demi visuals. The performances--Reynolds(doing a Senator Claghorn imitation), Rhames and Assante are all very good and are pleasant company between strips. And Demi!!! Instead of her usual glum stick in the mud performances, the actress really seems come alive here---practically bouncing off the screen. Apparently being half naked throughout 3/5ths of the film liberated Moore and for the first time this viewer found her more than a blank---thespically speaking of course. And as for her very elaborate and take no prisoners strips? A) Moore is actually a fine dancer and does all of her own routines. While CHICAGO had to create the dancing of its leads, that is most definitely Moore up there spinning on the pole and doing backflips over a chair. B) The actress is very agile. One had no idea from her other films. She should try an action film. CATWOMAN???? C) She can probably crack walnuts with her thighs.Tacky, crude, a prostitution of the cinematic arts for political purposes, exploitative, obscene language and filled with semi naked women, the film has no socially redeeming qualities at all.It is a keeper.Recommended.YEEEEHHHAAAAAAAA!!!!!",3,the greatest liberal propaganda movie EVER made!!,1344729600,"08 12, 2012",2012,4640,"['STRIPTEASE',
