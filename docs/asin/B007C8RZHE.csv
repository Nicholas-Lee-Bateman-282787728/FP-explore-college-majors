In one instance, a quick shot of B-29's were shown on island bases as the story of McArthur's withdrawl from the Bataan was discussed (B-29's entered the war well after Bataan). In another, B-29's were shown on on an air base in England just before D-Day was launched. I don't believe they were there in June of 1944, nor were ever used in the European theater.

Race ""Jose Mango""","[1, 1]","3474 men and women received the country's highest military honor, and their stories are remarkable and representative of our brave souls.  The series covers battles from the Civil War right up to present times.  The medal is ""awarded for conspicuous gallantry at the risk of his or her life above and beyond the call of duty while engaged in an action against an enemy of the USA.""  As the act has to be witnessed by two people, I often wonder how many medals are never awarded, like when a whole unit is wiped out, e.g. Custer's Last Stand.

1529721,ANW7ZQSOJQ2A7,B007C8RZHE,"Richard Muller ""old school audiologist""","[13, 14]","This just arrived yesterday, and I must admit, I ordered it with some misgivings.  I have seen some of the men awarded this Medal on The Military Channel, and most do not think that they were heroes at all.  They were simply doing their job when extraordinary circumstances put them in a position that called for sacrifice -- not something you spend time thinking about!  This particular documentary is divided into 6 parts: Civil War, World War One, World War II Europe, World War II Pacific, Korea and Vietnam.  At the conclusion of the Vietnam segment there is the inclusion of recipients from the Somalia, Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts as well.  This documentary appears to be very up to date (2012) and covers the awards presented by President Obama.  There are some speeches made at these presentations by former Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson and George W. Bush, as well as by President Obama.  Otherwise this film is centered on the backgrounds of the conflicts/wars, giving us an idea of what brought men to these terrible venues.There is a great deal of stock photos and footage, with a progression of technical achievements that allows better realism.  There are also many scenes done by ""re-enacters"", from the Civil War up to and including Vietnam.  These are supplemented by footage pertinent to the era.  I have to register one complaint, and that is the sound of the narrator.  Oddly compressed for an HD recording, the lack of dynamics also lulls one to doze during certain stretches.  Also, one must sit through the introduction to each portion of the film.  This may have been due to showing it in other venues as a series of films instead of one lengthy piece.  Once again, the last bits of the film fare better, but that hardly makes up for almost 3 hours of mediocre sound and continual intros.  Overall the presentation is good, the idea behind the presentation even better, and  -lest we forget -- the number of people who live to tell the tale of their personal battle are few indeed.  As the film points out, as the weapons of war ""improve"", the odds of surviving a close encounter go way down.  Most of all it is imperative that we recognize and honor the ultimate sacrifice made by these extraordinary members of the armed forces.  It gets you to thinking: ""Could I do this?""  Unless we are faced with the incredible test of being in such horrendous situations, we may never know.  But it is this virtually instantaneous response to choose a certain path that makes this decoration truly a Medal Of Honor.",3,"Medal Of Honor, Valor, Gallantry, Devotion...",1336089600,"05 4, 2012",2012,2532,"['just', 'arrived', 'yesterday', 'must', 'admit', 'ordered', 'misgivings', 'have', 'seen', 'men', 'awarded', 'Medal', 'Military', 'Channel', 'most', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'were', 'heroes', 'were', 'simply', 'doing', 'job', 'when', 'extraordinary', 'circumstances', 'put', 'position', 'called', 'sacrifice', 'not', 'something', 'spend', 'time', 'thinking', 'about', 'particular', 'documentary', 'divided', '6', 'parts', 'Civil', 'War', 'World', 'War', 'One', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Europe', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Pacific', 'Korea', 'Vietnam', 'conclusion', 'Vietnam', 'segment', 'inclusion', 'recipients', 'Somalia', 'Iraq', 'Afghanistan', 'conflicts', 'as', 'well', 'documentary', 'be', 'very', 'up', 'date', '2012', 'awards', 'presented', 'President', 'Obama', 'are', 'speeches', 'made', 'presentations', 'former', 'Presidents', 'Lyndon', 'B.', 'Johnson', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'as', 'well', 'President', 'Obama', 'Otherwise', 'film', 'centered', 'backgrounds', 'conflicts/wars', 'giving', 'idea', 'what', 'brought', 'men', 'terrible', 'venues.There', 'great', 'deal', 'stock', 'photos', 'footage', 'progression', 'technical', 'achievements', 'better', 'realism', 'are', 'also', 'many', 'scenes', 'done', 're-enacters', 'Civil', 'War', 'up', 'including', 'Vietnam', 'are', 'supplemented', 'footage', 'pertinent', 'era', 'have', 'register', 'one', 'complaint', 'sound', 'narrator', 'Oddly', 'compressed', 'HD', 'recording', 'lack', 'dynamics', 'also', 'one', 'doze', 'certain', 'stretches', 'Also', 'must', 'sit', 'introduction', 'portion', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'due', 'showing', 'other', 'venues', 'series', 'films', 'instead', 'one', 'lengthy', 'piece', 'Once', 'again', 'last', 'bits', 'film', 'fare', 'better', 'hardly', 'up', 'almost', '3', 'hours', 'mediocre', 'sound', 'continual', 'intros', 'presentation', 'good', 'idea', 'presentation', 'even', 'better', '-lest', 'forget', 'number', 'people', 'who', 'live', 'tell', 'tale', 'personal', 'battle', 'are', 'few', 'indeed', 'film', 'points', 'out', 'weapons', 'war', 'improve', 'odds', 'surviving', 'close', 'encounter', 'go', 'way', 'down', 'Most', 'imperative', 'recognize', 'honor', 'ultimate', 'sacrifice', 'made', 'extraordinary', 'members', 'armed', 'forces', 'thinking', 'Could', 'do', 'are', 'faced', 'incredible', 'test', 'being', 'such', 'horrendous', 'situations', 'may', 'never', 'know', 'virtually', 'instantaneous', 'response', 'choose', 'certain', 'path', 'decoration', 'truly', 'Medal', 'Honor']",N/A
