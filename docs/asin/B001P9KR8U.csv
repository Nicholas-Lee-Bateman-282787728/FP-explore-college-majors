It is more like, he knows the value of love and clings to it, even in the slums. From the episode in the crapper, where he will do anything to earn a living, and also get the autograph of his favorite Bollywood star, to the way his mother sacrifices herself, to the way he repays the little girl for helping them by making her a third 'Musketeer', he holds on to love no matter what.By contrast we have Salim, his brother, only out for himself, and selfdestructive with it. He is the true slumdog, not willing to work an honest job, acting as a pimp to the poor girl Jamal tries to rescue because he has always loved her, and so full of hate he kills without compunction.  Only at the end does he show he is able to love but by then it is too late.This film has layers like an onion and some great performances by young actors, but it is not jolly happy viewing, with rape, torture, maiming, and every other crime and inhumanity to man you can think of. It is also a predictable ending, a kind of modern morality play, so while it is a compelling narrative, and I would recommend it, I do have my reservations as above.",4,Jamal's journey,1241740800,"05 8, 2009",2009,1610,"['Jamal', 'journey', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'title', 'film', 'interesting', 'means', 'perfect', 'Best', 'Picture', 'material', 'except', 'insofar', 'think', 'touched', 'liberal', 'hearts', 'plight', 'poor', 'Bombay-so', 'will', 'hand', 'out', 'gold', 'statuettes', 'forget', 'them.Jamal', 'child', 'man', 'still', 'remain', 'pure', 'idealistic', 'temptations.When', 'being', 'tortured', 'interrogated', 'asked', 'slumdog', 'know', 'said', 'answers', 'more', 'value', 'love', 'clings', 'even', 'slums', 'episode', 'crapper', 'where', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'earn', 'living', 'also', 'get', 'autograph', 'favorite', 'Bollywood', 'star', 'way', 'mother', 'sacrifices', 'way', 'little', 'girl', 'helping', 'making', 'third', ""'Musketeer"", 'love', 'matter', 'what.By', 'contrast', 'have', 'Salim', 'brother', 'only', 'out', 'selfdestructive', 'true', 'slumdog', 'not', 'willing', 'work', 'honest', 'job', 'acting', 'pimp', 'poor', 'girl', 'Jamal', 'rescue', 'always', 'loved', 'so', 'full', 'hate', 'compunction', 'Only', 'end', 'show', 'able', 'love', 'then', 'too', 'late.This', 'film', 'layers', 'onion', 'great', 'performances', 'young', 'actors', 'not', 'jolly', 'happy', 'viewing', 'rape', 'torture', 'maiming', 'other', 'crime', 'inhumanity', 'man', 'can', 'think', 'also', 'predictable', 'ending', 'kind', 'modern', 'morality', 'play', 'so', 'compelling', 'narrative', 'would', 'recommend', 'do', 'have', 'reservations', 'above']",N/A
1226078,A3CCVD1MKDVWZ7,B001P9KR8U,"A. Heifetz ""Arlekino1""","[3, 9]","""Slumdog Millionaire"" is a gripping film.  It has a great story, even though it is not plausible.  The camera work is so magnificent that even without the storytelling part, it would be a great documentary about India akin to ""Baraka"".  The acting is superb.  There have been many great reviews and enough said about its strengths.  The part I found puzzling that Jamal is arrested after the first day of the show and tortured all night.  Is there enough evidence to get him arrested?  The torture is even more severe than anything allowed at Guantanamo Bay - at least they do not use electric shocks there.  At one point, even the police officer in charge gets scared that Jamal is electrocuted.  I wonder if that is the standard practice in India and what Indian viewers would make of it.  Then, perhaps in only a few hours, Jamal seems to be in perfect form to continue the contest on television.  If I survived that kind if an ordeal, I would probably need at least a month to recover.  The mutilation of an orphan child scene is very disturbing.  Even during the darkest of times and among the most depraved of people, it is hard to even imagine a character as evil as the orphanage keeper who mutilates a child for monetary gain.  If that sort of thing really happened, I wonder how it would affect the keeper's karma.  Finally, the ending is lame.  Although completely fictional, the film's story is serious and the silly dance scene erodes it's emotional impact.  It was like telling viewers, ""You got into it, didn't you?  But we were just kidding here.""  Still, this is a great film and it deserves 4 stars.",4,"Yes, I agree, it is a great film but let me add something...",1235174400,"02 21, 2009",2009,1617,"['Slumdog', 'Millionaire', 'gripping', 'film', 'great', 'story', 'even', 'not', 'plausible', 'camera', 'work', 'so', 'magnificent', 'even', 'storytelling', 'part', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'documentary', 'India', 'akin', 'Baraka', 'acting', 'superb', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'great', 'reviews', 'enough', 'said', 'strengths', 'part', 'found', 'puzzling', 'Jamal', 'arrested', 'first', 'day', 'show', 'tortured', 'night', 'there', 'enough', 'evidence', 'get', 'arrested', 'torture', 'even', 'more', 'severe', 'anything', 'allowed', 'Guantanamo', 'Bay', 'least', 'do', 'not', 'use', 'electric', 'shocks', 'there', 'one', 'point', 'even', 'police', 'officer', 'charge', 'scared', 'Jamal', 'electrocuted', 'wonder', 'standard', 'practice', 'India', 'what', 'Indian', 'viewers', 'would', 'make', 'Then', 'perhaps', 'only', 'few', 'hours', 'Jamal', 'be', 'perfect', 'form', 'continue', 'contest', 'television', 'survived', 'kind', 'ordeal', 'would', 'probably', 'need', 'least', 'month', 'recover', 'mutilation', 'orphan', 'child', 'scene', 'very', 'disturbing', 'Even', 'darkest', 'times', 'most', 'depraved', 'people', 'hard', 'even', 'imagine', 'character', 'as', 'evil', 'orphanage', 'keeper', 'who', 'child', 'monetary', 'gain', 'sort', 'thing', 'really', 'happened', 'wonder', 'how', 'would', 'affect', 'keeper', 'karma', 'Finally', 'ending', 'lame', 'completely', 'fictional', 'film', 'story', 'serious', 'silly', 'dance', 'scene', 'emotional', 'impact', 'was', 'telling', 'viewers', 'got', 'did', ""n't"", 'were', 'just', 'kidding', 'here', 'Still', 'great', 'film', '4', 'stars']",N/A

1226087,A1ZOF747O5EB6R,B001P9KR8U,Andrew Desmond,"[1, 2]","""Slumdog Millionaire"" is a terrific film.  It is a film of great drama set against the backdrop of modern India where an uneducated boy from the slums rises to challenge for stardom on ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire"".  Yet it is more than just this.  It is also a film of escape from horror and poverty.  In many ways, it touches the core of the human spirit.Do not for one minute think that this film is typical Bollywood.  It is gripping drama with not a song in reach.  We see the lives of three slum children: Jamal, Salim and Latika.  They are forced to struggle as orphans when their parents are killed in religious unrest.  They are sold into beggary and prostitution but manage to escape to greater or lesser degrees.  They drift apart until a final reckoning when Jamal receives national fame for challenging on the Millionaire programme.The story is told in flashbacks.  Jamal is being forced to explain his television success.  As his story unfolds, we also come to understand how he arrived at television success.  The simple fact was that each question had an answer that he had learned somewhere along the road of life.  The show's producers are not convinced but India is entranced.  Jamal is a folk hero.  But before the reader concludes that the game show is the heart of the plot, I must stress that it is not.  Rather, the true story is one of escape from dreadful poverty.

1226088,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B001P9KR8U,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 4]","It seemed that about mid-year, 2008, the entire world (at least the cinematic world) caught a serious case of Slumdog Fever and soon the critics bodies and big prestigious awards bodies followed suit, handing over a near complete sweep of awards to a small yet bountiful film entitled `Slumdog Millionaire', a project that was probably on no ones radar and yet proved to be on everyone's minds.  Looking back on the film (and recently revisiting it) I have to say that I'm still somewhat baffled by the rapturous applause this film received.I said somewhat.Personally, I have never seen a film that was so over-thought and yet simultaneous so under-thought as `Slumdog Millionaire'.  For a film that prides itself in telling elaborate stories to add layers to a humble `slumdogs' apparent knowledge (a young boy actually wades through fecal mater for an autograph), this film all but seems to stop thinking completely in parts where it truly matters (like wrapping up a sloppy ending with a rather unlikely love story).  The film had a nice concept, but the script is poorly realized and comes off unnecessary and actually quite choppy in the end.Not for a lack of trying though.There are many elements in play here, but the film doesn't know how to tie them all together cohesively.  It is almost like the `gameshow' aspect of the film was an afterthought, something used to connect the dots when instead it actually serves as a distraction.  Yes, I know that this is adapted from a novel; I'm just stating how the tone of the film came across to me, especially in the end, as the film is tying up lose ends.I kind of have to applaud Danny Boyle here, and so I'll stop my critique to offer a slice of appreciation for the director behind this uneven offering.  Boyle is a director that I really admire and respect.  I have seen a number of his films, and what I love so much about him is that he is a director who will try anything and will adapt to any subject.  He is hard to pigeonhole because his vision is not tied down to one specific theme.  He has a masterful way of creating imagery that is honest and raw without losing a slice of humor that sets the tone of his films apart.  As a directorial effort, I can see a lot of thought in `Slumdog Millionaire'.  I don't think that his efforts were entirely successful (obviously) but I can see flourishes of greatness here.  I'm so elated that he has an Oscar, but I'm saddened at the same time because it came for (arguably) his weakest work.Where was Oscar in '03, when he delivered the brilliant '28 Days Later'?  Where were they in '05 when he stunned with his touching yet original `Millions'?  What about his shocking sophomore film in '96, `Trainspotting'?Alas...`Slumdog Millionaire' follows young Jamal as he nears the home stretch of India's version of `Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'.  The film begins with an interrogation where he is being accused of cheating.  The film then jumps back and forth between his moments on the show, his interrogation and his childhood as he explains to the cops how he knows all the answers.  At times the films explanation of things can be pretty smart, other times they are fairly lazy.  That is what I mean by uneven; over-thought and under-thought.  The ending itself is shamefully under-thought.  The entire `Jamal/Latika' love story is seriously under-thought.  The character development feels like an afterthought.  The development of Salim alone is disgusting.  I have never really encountered a more vile character in recent cinema, and yet for some reason I'm not supposed to feel this way.  The film offers no real development to persuade me in the desired direction.  In fact, I can't decide if my smile at the films end had to do with what happened on the gameshow or in the bathtub.The acting was decent, but nothing (and I mean NOTHING) to write home about.  Dev Patel was bland beyond words, and Freida Pinto was barely used (but effective).  The real standout here was Anil Kapoor, who evoked more emotional commitment than any actor in the film.  The young actors were well used, especially Ayush Mahesh Khedekar, who played young Jamal.I won't lie; I enjoyed this film, I was just disappointed.  For a film with such promise, `Slumdog Millionaire' easily finds itself suffering from generic clich&eacute;s that haunt many films.  I expected more from Boyle.  I expected a film with this much praise to rise above those stereotypes and formulate something fresh and original.  The characters feel like skeletal variations (as in `lacking detail') of many other characters from many other movies.  In then end, I was smiling but when the confetti cleared I was left pondering just how much better this movie really could have been.And is it just me or was the ending credits nosedive into music video edited `You Got Served' territory totally fun yet tremendously cheap feeling?",3,Not quite out of the slums yet...,1274918400,"05 27, 2010",2010,4894,"['seemed', 'mid-year', '2008', 'entire',

However, it is more like deeply depressing. As others have mentioned it is the story of a very poor boy from the slums of India that grows up and becomes a millionaire and gets the girl.There are a lot of problems with the story itself (severe violence that verges on the edge of a horror flick) but also, there are problems with lack of characterization and poor editing. Most of the flashback scenes of the children are horribly shot, with jerky motions and thick accents.  It was very hard to follow and very hard to pull characterization out of this video game style direction. The brother of the main character loves him so he risks his life to escape with him from a very bad man but later, brother points a gun at his bother and threatens to kill him so that he can get laid. Really? Later same brother gives up something big for his brother and this girl to be together. Make up your mind man...The love story is supposed to be epic but it is one of those stories where a girl and a guy stand together and the story tells us that they are in love but there is no reason in the story for the great love. The final scene is supposed to be redemptive, I guess, as the hero and the girl kiss and then there is a very bollywood type dance scene (not part of the story) - but I was in no mood. The violence and horror the two characters go through in no way could be made better by the final events of the film -- so I was in no mood.It was in now way enjoyable.

I gave the movie three stars because the cinematography (the visual) and the soundtrack are excellent.  As I said however in my review title this type of movie has such a predictable outcome that it lacks suspense.  Because of the flashbacks you know everything will turn out for Jamal and why would the game show set be used in the first place if he were not going to win everything?I do think Jamal's adult character does a good job of acting as someone suffering post-traumatic stress as he is forced to relive his life while answering the questions but beyond that the acting is average.  Again, the acting is rescued by spectacular visuals of India, very good juxtaposition between the slums and modern technology and by those cute, adorable children used during the first part of Jamal's life.  Images of cute children will always rescue a mediocre plot.The story also skips around a lot and has a bizarre speed of slow pace, fast pace- back to slow pace which I found very hard to keep track of.  There were times the movie seemed to be getting interesting, then it would switch back to dull.Movies that are set in foreign countries tend to do well at the Academy and Slumdog was no exception.  An unfamiliar location and culture adds a certain amount of romanticism to a movie which often will override a mediocre plot as Slumdog Millionaire benefits from the location where it was filmed.

E Jackson,"[0, 0]","First of all, the VERY first thing I need to say is this-Do NOT let the previews you've seen of Slumdog Millionaire fool you- this movie is much more than just a contestant appearing on a gameshow, winning money, and winning back his girlfriend for a happy conclusion.Slumdog Millionaire is about MUCH more than that.It's about the contestant winning money on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire (the Mumbai version, which is the name of a city in India), but the storyline is more about how the contestant even GOT the opportunity to appear on the show, and the life long build-up of the contestants tragic and horrible past.It's a story that focuses on the contestants past, and the way he had to grow up in a poor, dangerous and just unsettling and unhealthy environment. He had to go through life basically looking out for himself, along with his small group of friends, just to survive.Throughout the movie, every time the contestant is about to answer a question on the gameshow, the story switches to something that happened in his past that enabled him to remember the answer to the questions he was being asked. Eventually there comes a point when the contestant answers so many questions correctly that he gets accused of cheating which leads to a little bit of violence.It might sound a bit tacky, and maybe to some it is tacky, but to me, it was a story told exceptionally well, and I highly recommend this movie. What will happen to the contestants group of friends as they grow up and grow apart? Well, you have to see it to believe it. I was totally attached to Slumdog Millionaire the entire time and I can NOW see why the film received so many awards.

This is a portrayal of India at odds with the modern image in every way.  Having never visited, I couldn't tell you which is correct.  But it sure puts you off of any thoughts you ever had about going to the Taj Majal or anywhere else in the country.The majority of this movie is a oft-distressing downer, unrelenting in its grimness.  Nevertheless, the first part of the film starts to become unintentionally funny after a while.  As in ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles,"" whatever our hero does, things always get worse for him, and you can count on a calamity whenever he starts to become comfortable or happy.  The ending is indeed uplifting and a Triumph of the Human Spirit, but it's ultimately too little, too late.So what's good about the film?  The performances are fantastic across the board, and we really buy into the characters.  The cinematography is colorful and spectacular.  You can always count on Boyle for great photography, whether in his best films like ""28 Days Later"" or his worst, ""Sunshine.""

I find the location and people fascinating and tend to gravitate towards anything and everything dealing with the Indian landscape, both physical, cultural and spiritual. Obviously this was a film I was destined to appreciate.I was impressed by the performances delivered by newcomers and stars; Dev Patel and the lovely Freida Pinto. However there were also a number of excellent though minor performances by actors who are all but unknown in American but actually quite famous and popular in India.

Director Danny Boyle (Trainspotting - Director's Cut (Collector's Edition),28 Days Later (Widescreen Edition)) has once again successfully eluded being pigeonholed as a genre director or as someone who revisits the same ground over and over with 'Slumdog', and even if the entire effort is not the most original, it's told with such energy and passion that it feels like a new experience.The young actors in 'Slumdog' are what elevates this film, in addition to the disturbing yet fascinating scenery of their journeys through Mumbai.  When it comes to the scenes in the slums, I'm sure there will be as many different opinions as there are reviewers, but personally, I thought the director gave an honest glimpse of a world that I know very little about.  What I especially appreciated was how he did not try to play on the viewers sympathy by taking time to over-emphasize the horrid conditions.  He simply filmed - and viewers may draw their own conclusions.And it is horrid, but that reinforces the vitality of these characters - that they are survivors.  What is even more endearing are the child actors who portray the main characters in the flashback sections.  According to an interview I caught the end of, they were plucked from the very slums the movie is set in.  All of the main characters (at whatever age) are played by young actors that without fail carry their roles with confidence and skill, until I couldn't hardly help but root for them as they tried to overcome all the obstacles between them.It is possible that the depiction of the slums in this movie, and Indian society as a whole, may overshadow the movie.  I think that would be a shame, though many of the images certainly have the ability to engender strong feelings.  I would encourage viewers sensitive to small children in extreme poverty think twice about watching, but I have to remember that, even though it doesn't conform to my views, this society has been successful for centuries.I did have a few minor problems with the film, though not really enough to drop the rating.  The biggest one was a scene that I felt was a swipe at Americans, who are shown as seeing a problem and only know how to throw money at it.  Stereotyping good hearted people who honestly try to do something doesn't help accomplish anything.This is almost a faultless date movie, and even though the characters are just teenagers, there was a mature feel to the whole film.  On the night we went, it was also senior night at the theater, and we were surrounded by the over 60 crowd.  But I was very impressed at how well they all behaved, and afterwards overheard them talking amongst themselves about how well they enjoyed it.  I do think that this movie deserved it's R rating though.  There are some early scenes of torture, plus some gun violence, and the life portrayed in the slums itself can be disconcerting.

Who would have thought Danny Boyle, a man from Manchester could have created such an award winning phenomenon. Slumdog Millionaire is a film I tried to keep away from as long as possible as I didn't want to seem like a person who jumps on the bandwagon. I guess it was inevitable that I was to see it eventually and tonight was the night. It has remained in my memory for a few hours so far and that lump in my throat has yet to subside. From start to finish I was completely engrossed and I have decided that those saying negative things about this picture are ones trying a bit too hard to steer clear of that dreaded wagon.So the story itself is based around 3 main characters, 4 if you count the ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?"" host. Jamal the main character starts off in a police station as he is accused of cheating to win the ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?"" big 20 Rupees prize. Determined to prove his innocence to the Police, he starts telling them the stories of situations in his life which taught him the answers to the questions which he has inadvertently remembered for all that time. What we get to see as the game show progresses are a number of different defining events in Jamals childhood that are in one way heart breaking and in another heart warming.He and his brother Salim remained very close to one another from birth and stuck together after their mother was killed. One night after the murder of their mother, they were sleeping in a container as protection from the rain and they met a girl named Latika. Jamal took this companionship from one of his favourite books and labelled them the Three Musketeers, although they could never remember the name of the third after Athos and Porthos. Salim's relationship is never too favourable towards Latika until they get older and after being split up at the still very early age, they meet up many years later and events get worse and worse with Salim raping Latika.There are other events that take place which I will not spoil for the sake of your enjoyment, so I will now comment on the other amazing parts of the film. The acting was superb throughout and brought some genuinely surprising choices and showed us what they were capable of. Of course the young and teenage versions of Salim, Jamal and Latika were superb but unfortunately attracted accusations of these Indian child actors being taken advantage of. Whether they were or not doesn't take anything away from their fantastic performances. The adult versions of the three characters are played by the fantastically surprising Dev Patel (Jamal), Freida Pinto (Latika) and Madhur Mittal (Salim). Each delivered an astonishing performance, especially from the wonderful Dev Patel known originally to myself as Anwar from Skins in the UK.The film was set mostly on location which allowed for the true tragedy of the Mumbai slums to be captured in all their glory. There have been things I've read that accuse Danny Boyle's picture of being demonising of the life in the slums. I don't know how you can demonise actual conditions being shown as they are, if anything I believe this is more complementary of the life in the slums. Although you could imagine it to be a very poor and dirty area, the slums are shot in a way that looks very artistic and in some senses quite beautiful. The soundtrack complements this immensely and I think without such spectacular music behind it, I think I would have had a whole different perspective on the film.To those steering clear of the film because of its massive award success, I have only one thing to say. You're idiots, the lot of you. This is a beautifully artistic masterpiece that should be enjoyed by all film fans alike. I could talk for hours about the psychological implications of the life suffered by the children in this picture, but I have chosen not too. It's a brilliant film that I know as long as you give it a chance, you will love it.",5,Stunning,1235433600,"02 24, 2009",2009,4071,"['know', 'been', 'said', 'million', 'times', 'already', 'hate', 'sound', 'clich', 'eacute', 'statement', 'true', 'time', 'say', 'Who', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'Danny', 'Boyle', 'man', 'Manchester', 'could', 'have', 'created', 'award', 'winning', 'phenomenon', 'Slumdog', 'Millionaire', 'film', 'tried', 'keep', 'away', 'as', 'long', 'as', 'possible', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'seem', 'person', 'who', 'bandwagon', 'guess', 'was', 'inevitable', 'was', 'see', 'eventually', 'tonight', 'was', 'night', 'remained', 'memory', 'few', 'hours', 'so', 'far', 'lump', 'throat', 'yet', 'subside', 'start', 'finish', 'was', 'completely', 'engrossed', 'have', 'decided', 'saying', 'negative', 'things', 'picture', 'are', 'ones', 'trying', 'bit', 'too', 'hard', 'steer', 'clear', 'dreaded', 'story', 'based', '3', 'main', 'characters', '4', 'count', 'Who', 'Be', 'A', 'Millionaire', 'host', 'Jamal', 'main', 'character', 'off', 'police', 'station', 'accused', 'cheating', 'win', 'Who', 'Be', 'A', 'Millionaire', 'big', '20', 'Rupees', 'prize', 'Determined', 'prove', 'innocence', 'Police', 'telling', 'stories', 'situations', 'life', 'taught', 'answers', 'questions', 'inadvertently', 'remembered', 'time', 'What', 'get', 'see', 'game', 'show', 'are', 'number', 'different', 'defining', 'events', 'Jamals', 'childhood', 'are', 'one', 'way', 'heart', 'breaking', 'heart', 'warming.He', 'brother', 'Salim', 'remained', 'very', 'close', 'one', 'birth', 'stuck', 'together', 'mother', 'was', 'killed', 'One', 'night', 'murder', 'mother', 'were', 'sleeping', 'container', 'protection', 'rain', 'met', 'girl', 'named', 'Latika', 'Jamal', 'took', 'companionship', 'one', 'favourite', 'books', 'labelled', 'Three', 'Musketeers', 'could', 'never', 'remember', 'name', 'third', 'Athos', 'Porthos', 'Salim', 'relationship', 'never', 'too', 'favourable', 'towards', 'Latika', 'get', 'older', 'being', 'split', 'up', 'still', 'very', 'early', 'age', 'meet', 'up', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'events', 'get', 'worse', 'worse', 'Salim', 'raping', 'Latika.There', 'are', 'other', 'events', 'take', 'place', 'will', 'not', 'spoil', 'sake', 'enjoyment', 'will', 'now', 'comment', 'other', 'amazing', 'parts', 'film', 'acting', 'was', 'superb', 'brought', 'genuinely', 'surprising', 'choices', 'showed', 'what', 'were', 'capable', 'course', 'young', 'teenage', 'versions', 'Salim', 'Jamal', 'Latika', 'were', 'superb', 'unfortunately', 'attracted', 'accusations', 'Indian', 'child', 'actors', 'being', 'taken', 'advantage', 'were', 'not', ""n't"", 'take', 'anything', 'away', 'fantastic', 'performances', 'adult', 'versions', 'three', 'characters', 'are', 'played', 'fantastically', 'surprising', 'Dev', 'Patel', 'Jamal', 'Freida', 'Pinto', 'Latika', 'Madhur', 'Mittal', 'Salim', 'delivered', 'astonishing', 'performance', 'especially', 'wonderful', 'Dev', 'Patel', 'known', 'originally', 'Anwar', 'Skins', 'UK.The', 'film', 'was', 'set', 'mostly', 'location', 'allowed', 'true', 'tragedy', 'Mumbai', 'slums', 'be', 'captured', 'glory', 'have', 'been', 'things', ""'ve"", 'read', 'accuse', 'Danny', 'Boyle', 'picture', 'being', 'demonising', 'life', 'slums', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'can', 'demonise', 'actual', 'conditions', 'being', 'shown', 'are', 'anything', 'believe', 'more', 'complementary', 'life', 'slums', 'could', 'imagine', 'be', 'very', 'poor', 'dirty', 'area', 'slums', 'are', 'shot', 'way', 'very', 'artistic', 'senses', 'quite', 'beautiful', 'soundtrack', 'immensely', 'think', 'such', 'spectacular', 'music', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'whole', 'different', 'perspective', 'film.To', 'steering', 'clear', 'film', 'massive', 'award', 'success', 'have', 'only', 'one', 'thing', 'say', ""'re"", 'idiots', 'lot', 'beautifully', 'artistic', 'masterpiece', 'should', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'fans', 'alike', 'could', 'talk', 'hours', 'psychological', 'implications', 'life', 'suffered', 'children', 'picture', 'have', 'chosen', 'not', 'too', 'brilliant', 'film', 'know', 'as', 'long', 'give', 'chance', 'will', 'love']",N/A

In ""City of God"" the protagonist uses his wits and photography to escape the slums to a decent and realistic life. This film is a bit more over the top with it's vehicles for delivering Jamal out of the slums. This film also heavily pushes fate as the driving force of nature behind everything. ""City of God"" just shows good old fashioned good luck and someone relying on their wits. Money is not the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow in ""City of God"" either.

Boy loses girl. Boy tries to get girl back...  But yet, in so many ways, it takes what could be such a dusty old story and makes it new again. Even the premise of a game show on first blush seems like it will yield little if anything of interest, but even though I am not a fan of these silly game shows (except of course Jeopardy, which challenges the mind) I was enthralled by this movie.And on top of the compelling story, you also get a most fascinating backdrop: India, and the City of Mumbai, formerly known as Bombay. You get teeming slums filled with poor but resourceful people juxtaposed with the splendor of the Taj Mahal; you get an ancient culture making rapid fire changes to a modern one, transforming before your eyes. Slumdog Millionaire is quite an achievement, and one that seems to have come along at precisely the best time: Like the game show, it offers an escape in times of economic strife.The device of the game show is brilliant, as it allows the questions, and the subsequent interrogations, to each trigger a flashback, an episode in the past that will illuminate how Jamal Malik, the nominative Slumdog Millionaire, came to know the answer. Sure, there is some luck involved, but oftentimes a memorable event in Jamal's past will make the answers stick in his mind. As we discover how he knew the answers we also learn about how much he loves Latika, and how his brother Salim became a gangster. The performances of the three characters in that ""bazaar"" love triangle, as children, and then young adults, were brilliant. Kudos to Dev Patel, Madhur Mittal, and the lovely Freida Pinto.

We were glued to the screen in order to find out why a non-educated orphan could answer correctly all the questions in Who Wants to Be a Millionaire show.The scenes of the answers to the last 2 questions are full of twists and suspense. One example is the moment when Jamal phoned his brother for the answer of the last question.The movie graphically and convincingly shows how determined Jamal was in order to get what he wanted. For example, he jumped into a pile of human waste that was higher than he in order to see his movie star in person.The scene where the bad guys scooped out the eye of the street kid had some truth in it. Some of my friends from a third world country said something like that did happen in their homeland. There were some gangs that kidnapped children. Then they twisted their arms to make them disabled.

He and his more ruthless brother, Samil, were left as orphans after their mother was killed by anti-Muslim rioters. They are soon joined by a sweet orphan girl named Latika (Freida Pinto). But after Latika and he become separated Jamal devotes himself to finding her.This is an energetic, fast paced movie sure to be a crowd pleaser, with its fairy tale story of a downtrodden underdog who refuses to give in. It's also realistic in its depiction of the horrific poverty that still exists in India despite the country's new high rise towers and other signs of economic development.

1226120,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001P9KR8U,Chris Pandolfi,"[4, 12]","For something that was meant to be a fable, Danny Boyle's ""Slumdog Millionaire"" takes itself far too seriously. It's a story of both the Rags to Riches and Love Conquers All persuasions, about an eighteen-year-old Indian boy who becomes a contestant on the Hindi version of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"" All throughout, his draws on life experience to select the answers. And what a life he has led; he came from nothing, a penniless orphan from the streets of Mumbai (formerly known as Bombay), and he grew up surrounded by poverty, violence, and abuse at the hand of unscrupulous people. I find it odd that Boyle, screenwriter Simon Beaufoy, and author Vikas Swarup (who wrote ""Q and A,"" the book on which this movie is based) were able to evoke so much hope, especially since it's unlikely the main characters would have survived past the age of ten.As I watched this movie, I made mental comparisons to last year's brilliant ""August Rush,"" which is thematically similar. The thing is, ""August Rush"" had the good sense to be totally unrealistic, which in turn allowed me to engage the story at a more emotional level. If the intention was for ""Slumdog Millionaire"" to be a heightened version of reality, then it didn't go far enough. When it comes to fairy tales, modern-day or otherwise, you either go all the way over the top, or you stay grounded--finding a gray area doesn't really get the job done.""Slumdog Millionaire"" tells the extraordinary story of Jamal Malik, who was born in the slums and raised with very little to his name. His life was anything but boring: when he was just a young boy (Ayush Mahesh Khedekar), he managed to get an autograph from Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan; he witnessed the death of his mother, who was brutally beaten to death during an anti-Muslim raid; he and his brother Salim (Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail) befriended an impoverished, parentless girl named Latika (Rubiana Ali). All three are taken in by the villainous Maman (Ankur Vikal), a gangster who forces destitute orphans to beg for money by singing. Some of his children are blinded so as to make them seem even more pathetic. Jamal and Salim are able to escape, but poor Latika is left behind, forcing her into a life of prostitution.The story flashes forward some years, at which point Jamal (Tanay Hemant Chheda) and Salim (Ashutosh Lobo Gajiwala) are teenagers barely getting by as souvenir sellers, pickpockets, and phony tour guides at the Taj Mahal. Jamal insists that they return to Mumbai to find Latika (Tanvi Ganesh Lonkar). At this point, we see just how different Jamal and Salim are: the former is hopeful and patient while the latter is hotheaded and easily impressionable. Upon returning to Mumbai, he seeks out a rival crime lord named Javed (Mahesh Manjrekar) and vies to be a part of his gang. This coupled with the discovery of Latika forces a divide between the two brothers.And this brings me to the present day, where Jamal (Dev Patel) works as a tea-fetching assistant at an Indian call center. In attempting to get back in touch with Latika (Freida Pinto), he tries out for ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"" which is so popular that he knows she will be watching. A physical reunion won't be so easy; Latika is kept in line by Salim (Madhur Mittal), who Javed has since promoted. If Jamal wins the game show, he just might be able to take Latika away from Mumbai and live happily ever after.Interwoven throughout the entire film are police interrogation scenes involving Jamal and a sergeant named Srinivas (Saurabh Shukla). I won't go into great detail here, but I will say that it directly relates to ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"" I'll also say that each of their scenes kick starts another flashback sequence that explains how Jamal answered specific questions on the show.It's an intriguing concept, and I'll admit that some of ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is satisfying. But a lot more of it is disappointing. Partly, it has to do with Jamal's sense of optimism, which seems a little overplayed given his terrible circumstances. I never really believed that someone so downtrodden could have so much to live for. A very negative thing to say, I know, but I really do feel that way. And while I get that this movie is supposed to be a fable, I still feel that too much of it is rooted in harsh reality. It certainly doesn't fit with the end credit sequence, which features a completely ill fitting Bollywood-style musical number. ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is a decent effort, but it doesn't quite measure up as far as escapist fantasies are concerned.",3,Is That Your Final Answer?,1230681600,"12 31, 2008",2008,4583,"['something', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'fable', 'Danny', 'Boyle', 'Slumdog', 'Millionaire', 'far', 'too', 'seriously', 'story', 'Rags', 'Riches', 'Love', 'Conquers', 'All', 'persuasions', 'eighteen-year-old', 'Indian', 'boy', 'who', 'contestant', 'Hindi', 'version', 'Who', 'Be', 'Millionaire', 'draws', 'life', 'experience', 'select', 'answers', 'what', 'life', 'led', 'came', 'nothing', 'penniless', 'orphan', 'streets', 'Mumbai', 'formerly', 'known', 'Bombay', 'grew', 'up', 'surrounded', 'poverty', 'violence', 'abuse', 'hand', 'unscrupulous', 'people', 'find', 'Boyle', 'screenwriter', 'Simon', 'Beaufoy', 'author', 'Vikas', 'Swarup', 'who', 'wrote', 'Q', 'A', 'book', 'movie', 'based', 'were', 'able', 'evoke', 'so', 'much', 'hope', 'especially', 'unlikely', 'main', 'characters', 'would', 'have', 'survived', 'age', 'ten.As', 'watched', 'movie', 'made', 'mental', 'comparisons', 'last', 'year', 'brilliant', 'August', 'Rush', 'thematically', 'similar', 'thing', 'August', 'Rush', 'had', 'good', 'sense', 'be', 'totally', 'unrealistic', 'turn', 'allowed', 'engage', 'story', 'more', 'emotional', 'level', 'intention', 'was', 'Slumdog', 'Millionaire', 'be', 'heightened', 'version', 'reality', 'then', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'far', 'enough', 'When', 'fairy', 'tales', 'modern-day', 'otherwise', 'either', 'go', 'way', 'top', 'stay', 'grounded', 'finding', 'gray', 'area', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'Slumdog', 'Millionaire', 'extraordinary', 'story', 'Jamal', 'Malik', 'who', 'was', 'born', 'slums', 'raised', 'very', 'little', 'name', 'life', 'was', 'anything', 'boring', 'when', 'was', 'just', 'young', 'boy', 'Ayush', 'Mahesh', 'Khedekar', 'managed', 'get', 'autograph', 'Bollywood', 'superstar', 'Amitabh', 'Bachchan', 'witnessed', 'death', 'mother', 'who', 'was', 'brutally', 'beaten', 'death', 'anti-Muslim', 'raid', 'brother', 'Salim', 'Azharuddin', 'Mohammed', 'Ismail', 'befriended', 'impoverished', 'parentless', 'girl', 'named', 'Latika', 'Rubiana', 'Ali', 'three', 'are', 'taken', 'villainous', 'Maman', 'Ankur', 'Vikal', 'gangster', 'who', 'destitute', 'orphans', 'beg', 'money', 'singing', 'children', 'are', 'blinded', 'so', 'make', 'seem', 'even', 'more', 'pathetic', 'Jamal', 'Salim', 'are', 'able', 'escape', 'poor', 'Latika', 'left', 'forcing', 'life', 'prostitution.The', 'story', 'flashes', 'forward', 'years', 'point', 'Jamal', 'Tanay', 'Hemant', 'Chheda', 'Salim', 'Ashutosh', 'Lobo', 'Gajiwala', 'are', 'teenagers', 'barely', 'getting', 'souvenir', 'sellers', 'pickpockets', 'phony', 'tour', 'guides', 'Taj', 'Mahal', 'Jamal', 'return', 'Mumbai', 'find', 'Latika', 'Tanvi', 'Ganesh', 'Lonkar', 'point', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'different', 'Jamal', 'Salim', 'are', 'former', 'hopeful', 'patient', 'latter', 'hotheaded', 'easily', 'impressionable', 'returning', 'Mumbai', 'out', 'rival', 'crime', 'lord', 'named', 'Javed', 'Mahesh', 'Manjrekar', 'vies', 'be', 'part', 'gang', 'coupled', 'discovery', 'Latika', 'forces', 'divide', 'two', 'brothers.And', 'present', 'day', 'where', 'Jamal', 'Dev', 'Patel', 'tea-fetching', 'assistant', 'Indian', 'call', 'center', 'attempting', 'get', 'back', 'touch', 'Latika', 'Freida', 'Pinto', 'out', 'Who', 'Be', 'Millionaire', 'so', 'popular', 'will', 'be', 'watching', 'physical', 'reunion', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'easy', 'Latika', 'kept', 'line', 'Salim', 'Madhur', 'Mittal', 'who', 'Javed', 'promoted', 'Jamal', 'game', 'show', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'take', 'Latika', 'away', 'Mumbai', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'after.Interwoven', 'entire', 'film', 'are', 'police', 'interrogation', 'scenes', 'involving', 'Jamal', 'sergeant', 'named', 'Srinivas', 'Saurabh', 'Shukla', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'great', 'detail', 'here', 'will', 'say', 'directly', 'Who', 'Be', 'Millionaire', ""'ll"", 'also', 'say', 'scenes', 'kick', 'flashback', 'sequence', 'how', 'Jamal', 'answered', 'specific', 'questions', 'show.It', 'intriguing', 'concept', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'Slumdog', 'Millionaire', 'satisfying', 'lot', 'more', 'disappointing', 'Partly', 'do', 'Jamal', 'sense', 'optimism', 'little', 'overplayed', 'given', 'terrible', 'circumstances', 'never', 'really', 'believed', 'someone', 'so', 'downtrodden', 'could', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'live', 'very', 'negative', 'thing', 'say', 'know', 'really', 'do', 'feel', 'way', 'get', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'fable', 'still', 'feel', 'too', 'much', 'rooted', 'harsh', 'reality', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'fit', 'end', 'credit', 'sequence', 'completely', 'ill', 'fitting', 'Bollywood-style', 'musical', 'number', 'Slumdog', 'Millionaire', 'decent', 'effort', ""n't"", 'quite', 'measure', 'up', 'as', 'far', 'escapist', 'fantasies', 'are', 'concerned']",N/A
1226121,AN9J46667D80O,B001P9KR8U,"Chris Swanson ""I'm just this guy, you know?""","[4, 8]","Believe the hype. Slumdog Millionaire, the latest film from Trainspotting director Danny Boyle, is every bit as amazing as you've heard. It's sweet, it's funny, it's tense, it's uplifting, it's spectacular!The movie tells the story of Jamal, a young Muslim boy (played at various stages by three different actors, but most notably by Dev Patel of Skins fame), who grows up in the slums of Bombay/Mumbai. These slums are the sort of places governments ignore until either a: they catch on fire, b: there's some major world event, like the Commonwealth Games, on the way and they want to clean up the place, or c: the people who live there make them pay attention.Through a series of unlikely events, ends up on India's version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, where he's about to win the highest jackpot ever. This, of course, leads to questions: is he cheating? How can he be doing this? He's just a boy from the slums, what does he know?As the movie unfolds, we see exactly how he answers the questions: he relates them to moments in his life. His knowledge of American currency, for example, comes up from a blind beggar boy who told him the name of the man whose face is on the $100 bill. There's another moment where he reads a person in a ""The Lady or the Tiger"" kind of way, trying to figure out if the answer the man fed him is real, or a bluff (for the record, I got the answer right before anything was fed. I have no idea why. It's not like I follow cricket, but at some point I must've picked up that bit of trivia and it stuck in my head, rather like with Jamal).The movie is as flawless as anything I've ever seen. Sure, it's unrealistic; a fairy-tale, basically, but who cares? It's beautifully told with some incredibly good acting and writing. The fact that Dev Patel is not up for an Oscar goes to prove that the Academy is pretty out-of-touch with the world. Well, that plus the fact that they give thirteen nominations to The Curious Case of Benjamin Boring. Even the music is noteworthy. I may well pick up the soundtrack.I cannot possibly praise this film high enough. It is a wonderful, delightful, uplifting movie. If you have a choice this weekend between seeing this and, say, My Bloody Valentine, see this. You can thank me later.One last side note: for reasons unclear to me the MPAA, that bastion of conservative nonsense, has rated this movie R. I have no idea why. Sure, there's a bit of language and you see some mild nudity, but so what? I'd feel quite comfortable taking children as young as eight or nine to this movie, provided they can read well enough to keep up with the occasional subtitles. The MPAA really just needs to be reformed or go away.

1226122,A35FC3DWA1M79H,B001P9KR8U,Christopher,"[2, 3]","I just got around to watching this.  It was very good, although only worth watching once.  This was a clear attempt to explore the Indians and their culture.  Years ago, they attempted a ""latin fever"" in order to sell people on that.  However, that was just a forced-fed fad that only lasted a year.East Indians are a very private and somewhat mysterious group.  They tend to keep to themselves, are usually highly educated (via books only), amass great wealth (which they keep on the low) and their numbers and wealth continues to increase, at least in the US.  Like all groups who were not known - seen, but not heard, Indians want to finally become visible.  So-called ""latin"" culture like East Indian cultures can never become an attractive sell to western audiences.  While you can take a little of this and a little of that, most of it is unattractive in many ways.With films like this and many Indians doing film and TV, it appears as if they would like to come out of their shells.  This happens when groups gain wealth and status within another society.  At first you just want to live, then you want to live well, then after you live well you want to be credited with living well!  This is good and I cannot knock the Indian commitment to education (on the books) and plans to gain and KEEP wealth, as it has more than worked.  They need to share some plans with African-Americans instead of being so secretive.So now, films like this and other TV and films help to shine light on East Indians - albeit in a European light, as opposed to an untouched version of Indians, which brings me to my next observation about the film.  First, it is no shocker that India started out black and then was invaded by white or white-like peoples referred to as Aryans and now called Hindus.  These people imposed an apartheid system in India thus keeping the blacks on the bottom and the white-like people at the top.  It has been that way it is still that way, although the more mixed ones move up since the top is getting darker.  Then you had the British and their racist ways which follows the Indian until this day.So, now my observations...  There are two brothers.  One is darker and one is lighter.  One (the darker one, Salim) has African type facial features and curly hair and the other has a narrower nose with straight hair.  From the start, Salim is more aggressive, heartless, greedy, selfish and not concerned with education.  The other brother is calm, caring, selfless, loving and cares about people.  It COULD be a coincidence that the lighter one is essentially ""good"" while the darker one is essentially ""bad,"" but I am sure someone will argue against it.As the film progresses, Salim becomes more embroiled in ""thug life"" and gangsta life while the other is always calm and loving and cares about the world around him.  Salim is ALWAYS thinking about crime, sex and drugs.  His hair also becomes more curled as the film goes on too!  Of course, Salim had to rape Latika while the other brother wanted love!  So, you throw in drugs, aggression, rape, crime, dark skin, African features AND curled hair - I am left with no choice but to think that this character was designed to emulate or give the audience thoughts about an African-American stereotype of criminality as opposed to an Indian.  The other brother (lighter with STRAIGHT hair) is shown to embody the righteousness in Indians.I could be wrong (I doubt it), but if they are brothers, how both of their hair was not curled of straight?  How come the brothers features were not consistent?  I just thought I'd point this out as this is another trick in Hollywood and Indian films.  I have noticed in Indian themed films, they seem to do what they can to separate themselves from the black family and unite with the whites.  Let's see...  There was ""Bend it Like Beckham"" where light-brown Indians were cast to contrast the very dark African or Jamaican in the film.  Of course they had to mention that ""those"" people are black while not mentioning their own blackness.  Instead, they act is if the whites are their people!  That casting was done on purpose.  Then you had Mississippi Masala with Denzel Washington.  He was darker than the Indians although they get much darker than he does.  It was to make the people ""called"" blacks appear to be black and separate from others in the black family.  In fact, I cannot think of any film where there are Indians and African type blacks where the Indians are shown as darker than the ""blacks.""  This is clear propaganda.Aside from that social commentary, it was a good film.  I just do not understand why the light brother stayed in love with the girl all of those years.  You mean to tell me that he did not have sex since she first left?  If he had, he would not have kept thinking about her.",4,"Pretty Good, Although it is Indian CUlture Propaganda and Borderline ""Racist.""",1313280000,"08 14, 2011",2011,4818,"['just', 'got', 'around', 'watching', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'only', 'worth', 'watching', 'once', 'was', 'clear', 'attempt', 'explore', 'Indians', 'culture', 'Years', 'ago', 'attempted', 'latin', 'fever', 'order', 'sell', 'people', 'However', 'was', 'just', 'forced-fed', 'fad', 'only', 'lasted', 'year.East', 'Indians', 'are', 'very', 'private', 'somewhat', 'mysterious', 'group', 'tend', 'keep', 'are', 'usually', 'highly', 'educated', 'books', 'only', 'amass', 'great', 'wealth', 'keep', 'low', 'numbers', 'wealth', 'increase', 'least', 'US', 'groups', 'who', 'were', 'not', 'known', 'seen', 'not', 'heard', 'Indians', 'want', 'finally', 'become', 'visible', 'So-called', 'latin', 'culture', 'East', 'Indian', 'cultures', 'can', 'never', 'become', 'attractive', 'sell', 'western', 'audiences', 'can', 'take', 'little', 'little', 'most', 'unattractive', 'many', 'ways.With', 'films', 'many', 'Indians', 'doing', 'film', 'TV', 'would', 'like', 'come', 'shells', 'when', 'groups', 'gain', 'wealth', 'status', 'society', 'first', 'just', 'want', 'live', 'then', 'want', 'live', 'well', 'then', 'live', 'well', 'want', 'be', 'credited', 'living', 'well', 'good', 'can', 'not', 'knock', 'Indian', 'commitment', 'education', 'books', 'plans', 'gain', 'KEEP', 'wealth', 'more', 'worked', 'need', 'share', 'plans', 'African-Americans', 'instead', 'being', 'secretive.So', 'now', 'films', 'other', 'TV', 'films', 'help', 'shine', 'light', 'East', 'Indians', 'albeit', 'European', 'light', 'opposed', 'untouched', 'version', 'Indians', 'next', 'observation', 'film', 'First', 'shocker', 'India', 'started', 'out', 'black', 'then', 'was', 'invaded', 'white', 'white-like', 'peoples', 'referred', 'Aryans', 'now', 'called', 'Hindus', 'people', 'imposed', 'apartheid', 'system', 'India', 'thus', 'keeping', 'blacks', 'bottom', 'white-like', 'people', 'top', 'been', 'way', 'still', 'way', 'more', 'mixed', 'ones', 'move', 'up', 'top', 'getting', 'darker', 'Then', 'had', 'British', 'racist', 'ways', 'Indian', 'day.So', 'now', 'observations', 'are', 'two', 'brothers', 'One', 'darker', 'one', 'lighter', 'One', 'darker', 'one', 'Salim', 'African', 'type', 'facial', 'features', 'curly', 'hair', 'other', 'narrower', 'nose', 'straight', 'hair', 'start', 'Salim', 'more', 'aggressive', 'heartless', 'greedy', 'selfish', 'not', 'concerned', 'education', 'other', 'brother', 'calm', 'caring', 'selfless', 'loving', 'cares', 'people', 'COULD', 'be', 'coincidence', 'lighter', 'one', 'essentially', 'good', 'darker', 'one', 'essentially', 'bad', 'am', 'sure', 'someone', 'will', 'argue', 'it.As', 'film', 'Salim', 'more', 'embroiled', 'thug', 'life', 'gangsta', 'life', 'other', 'always', 'calm', 'loving', 'world', 'Salim', 'ALWAYS', 'thinking', 'crime', 'sex', 'drugs', 'hair', 'also', 'more', 'curled', 'film', 'too', 'course', 'Salim', 'had', 'rape', 'Latika', 'other', 'brother', 'wanted', 'love', 'So', 'throw', 'drugs', 'aggression', 'rape', 'crime', 'dark', 'skin', 'African', 'features', 'curled', 'hair', 'am', 'left', 'choice', 'think', 'character', 'was', 'designed', 'emulate', 'give', 'audience', 'thoughts', 'African-American', 'stereotype', 'criminality', 'opposed', 'Indian', 'other', 'brother', 'lighter', 'STRAIGHT', 'hair', 'shown', 'embody', 'righteousness', 'Indians.I', 'could', 'be', 'wrong', 'doubt', 'are', 'brothers', 'how', 'hair', 'was', 'not', 'curled', 'straight', 'How', 'come', 'brothers', 'features', 'were', 'not', 'consistent', 'just', 'thought', ""'d"", 'point', 'out', 'trick', 'Hollywood', 'Indian', 'films', 'have', 'noticed', 'Indian', 'themed', 'films', 'seem', 'do', 'what', 'can', 'separate', 'black', 'family', 'unite', 'whites', 'Let', 'see', 'was', 'Bend', 'Beckham', 'where', 'light-brown', 'Indians', 'were', 'cast', 'contrast', 'very', 'dark', 'African', 'Jamaican', 'film', 'course', 'had', 'mention', 'people', 'are', 'black', 'not', 'mentioning', 'own', 'blackness', 'Instead', 'act', 'whites', 'are', 'people', 'casting', 'was', 'done', 'purpose', 'Then', 'had', 'Mississippi', 'Masala', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'was', 'darker', 'Indians', 'get', 'much', 'darker', 'was', 'make', 'people', 'called', 'blacks', 'appear', 'be', 'black', 'separate', 'others', 'black', 'family', 'fact', 'can', 'not', 'think', 'film', 'where', 'are', 'Indians', 'African', 'type', 'blacks', 'where', 'Indians', 'are', 'shown', 'darker', 'blacks', 'clear', 'social', 'commentary', 'was', 'good', 'film', 'just', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'light', 'brother', 'stayed', 'love', 'girl', 'years', 'mean', 'tell', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'sex', 'first', 'left', 'had', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'kept', 'thinking']",N/A

Slumdog Millionaire is the little movie that I'm sure not many expected to become the blockbuster hit it was and of course winning all the Oscars it did. There's a lot of hype on Slumdog and the good news is due to that people will see it; the downside is there's bound to be some backlash. What many people though are wondering does Slumdog Millionaire live up to all the hype? The answer is yes and no.Slumdog Millionaire is a great flick for sure and I would rate the movie as one of my favorites of 2008, but personally I don't think Slumdog is best picture good. I thought the movie was good enough, but there were some other movies I thought were a bit better and some weren't nominated, but despite that Slumdog Millionaire is a great flick and worthy of the praise, but don't get caught up too much with the hype because than you'll be bound to be disappointed. A lot of people have compared Slumdog Millionaire to Rocky due to the underdog vibe both movies have and that's where the strength of Slumdog comes from. Everybody loves an underdog story and I'm sure that in part is what helped Slumdog dominate the Oscars.The screenplay by Simon Beaufoy is very well written and the characters are rock solid; the main character is Jamal and we follow him through his life played by three different actors and I really liked the concept of that and I think that's what makes this movie so likeable to you follow the character around and see the tough life he has and it brings sympathy to him. Slumdog is sort of that movie that as you watch it you get more and more invested in the lives of these characters and any possible flaws you can find are more than made up for due to that.Danny Boyle has been a director who has had a nice following, but here with Slumdog Millionaire he's now a major player in Hollywood. Boyle does a great job with Slumdog and all the praise he's gotten for the movie is more than deserving; the pacing of Slumdog is excellent and the movie is always moving forward with the plot or characters. Boyle manages to grab the viewers' attention from the start and always keeps you invested in the life of Jamal and the other characters. Danny Boyle creates some truly deep and touching scenes and is able to really bring out a lot of different emotions while you watch the movie.The acting is solid from pretty much all the cast members and Dev Patel and Freida Pinto are both talents to watch for in the future. The character of Jamal played Ayush Mahesh Khedekar, Ashutosh Lobo Gajiwala and then by Dev Patel is a truly great character that you can get behind and root for and all three actors are excellent.Slumdog Millionaire is a great movie, but what elevates the movie is how we follow Jamal through different times in his life and that's what will hook the viewer and make us so invested in his life and how it will all turn out.

Director Danny Boyle and scenarist Simon Beaufoy ingeniously tap into this wish fullfillment and transplant it to India, a country that contains some of the most unimaginable poverty.  Reading some of the other reviews it appears that their film runs the gamut of love it or hate it.  Some feel that they are exploiting the suffering in India for commercial gain.  Others react to the plaudits the film received at the Oscars this year.  I don't have an answer to either criticism.  I can tell you I was engrossed throughout.  I think the critical and commercial success of the film is a response to the Cinderella aspects of the story which serve as an anecdote to our tough economic times.

Simon Beaufoy's screenplay, adapted from a novel by Vikas Swarup, tells this story brilliantly through the Indian version of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"", where Jamal, an uneducated young man, manages to know the answers to some very difficult questions, leading him to the point where he has only one question to win the 20 million rupees.  Why he knows these particular answers and how he got to the game show unfolds through flashbacks, starting with the massacre of an entire village except for Jamal, his brother Samil, and a little girl named Latika. The violent street life that Jamal has known and the love he has lost have uniquely prepared him for this moment.Dev Patel as the adult Jamal and Freida Pinto as the adult Latika create their roles with passion and subtlety, giving the rest of the cast an opportunity to shine next to them.  The child actors are as natural and compelling as their adult counterparts.  Viewers will find themselves alternately looking away from the horrors and then cheering for the way destiny exerts its ironies.

1226139,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B001P9KR8U,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[2, 3]","The camera pans the white monoliths baking in the glaring Indian sun as Jamal's street smart brother Salim waves his hand towards the burgeoning panorama of construction concrete and dust and in a manner of introduction (he has not seen his sibling for years) explains that the site of this savvy new business park in Mumbai's boomtown of finance and commerce once contained the unbelievable (from a Western stance) dichotomy of vibrant patchwork color and dingy garbage-fill filth that like a Bizarro-World sunburnt vision of Legoland constructs the mire mosaic slum in which the Brothers Malik were born.In director Danny Boyle's 2008 film ""Slumdog Millionaire"" one gets the impression that as the apprehensive Jamal, the child-to-teenage protagonist, struggles to emerge as a viable force with which to be reckoned in his own right--he consistently overcomes one trial of urban treachery after another as all the mythic heroes from Hercules, Jason and Krishna do, literally rising from a sludge of excrement in a moment of quasi-lightness as he imperturbably pursues a coveted autograph from a Bollywood actor helicoptered into the capital amidst a scattershot of plastic and cardboard garbage fluttering as innocuously as autumn leaves--so does modern day India strive to reinvent itself, wishing to shed its reputation of over population and poverty with the apparent ease of a bulldozer flattening acres of slum dwellings to reveal a real-time optical illusion of power and prosperity shimmering with the promise of world-class commercial status after the dust settles.Whether or not Boyle had this analogy in mind, ""Slumdog Millionaire"" fascinates with its vivid depiction of a transitional India in a twist on the typical rag-to-riches storyline where grossly-over-populated-slum boy makes good and, of course, gets the girl of his dreams. Jamal, a chai-wallah (tea maestro) for a large telecommunications firm inadvertently finds himself on India's version of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"" complete with smarmy jokes and a slick Bollywood version of Regis Philbin. Unlucky Slumdog, with just one question to go to win 20 million rupees, is arrested for cheating and spends most of the film's running time in the police station explaining through life-lesson rather than lifeline vignettes just how he knows the answers to questions that have stumped far more educated contestants. Through the devise of flashback, the audience cringes as Jamal and his older brother Salim played initially by younger child actors, watch their mother murdered by a marauding group of Muslim-hating crazies and as orphans fend in a horrific stomach-churning world of harsh endurance that seems more hellish than anything Dante could imagine. Somehow they survive some downright disturbing almost vomit-inducing entrapments escaping from personifications of evil that Dickens would have loved to make you hate. On average Boyle dishes up an extra huge serving of fraternal devotion with zings as tangy as an expertly concocted chutney as the brothers and Jamal's love interest, Latika, barrel through the underbelly of their country undergoing two other actor reincarnations before the final denouement revolving around the television game show studio hot seat.Bottom Line? ""Slumdog Millionaire"" gruesomely depicts an India that few would want to visit. Set in Mumbai's Dharavi slum, the otherwise could-be predictability of the boy-meets-girl, boy-conquers-adversity formula escapist fare takes on the additional nuance of the travelogue, introducing the viewer beyond the Pillars of Hercules to an unfamiliar world where dragons lie and commerce wants to reign. No one need `ask the audience' for the final answer on this flick--it surely entertains on a variety of levels despite its predictability and almost ruthless exploitation of the viewer's emotions.

That said, while it seemed at first that Slumdog might actually live up to the enormous hype, things started getting a bit silly when the boys reached Agra. Having spent several months in India over the course of two trips, the Taj scenes were unrealistic at best and I was never really hypnotized by the film again after that. Security is very tight at the Taj and street urchins operating a stolen shoe ring simply wouldn't happen as you don't take your shoes off until you're well past the military style checkpoint that ""slumdogs"" would never be able to pass. This in itself didn't ruin the film or anything, but starting with those scenes my suspension of disbelief generally faltered and the whole thing began to feel somewhat contrived. I suppose the writer's desire to plug in the trusty old ""rags to riches"" story was probably the main reason for this as VERY FEW Indian street kids ever climb the social ladder. I feel that Jamal losing out on the money but finally rescuing the girl would have made for a more realistic (and artistically apropos) ending. Concerning Jamal, I also failed to see any physical resemblance between the adult version and the two younger ones. Actually, Dev Patel has a significantly lighter complexion than any of the actors who played Salim, Latika, or the younger Jamal.Ultimately, it seems to me that the gaggle of Oscars might actually damage Slumdog's reception somewhat as they inevitably lead one to believe that this is a once in a generation type of film. Simply put, it's not. For my money, City of God was a better executed film about street kids and Born into Brothels (while a documentary) was a superior chronicle of the Indian variety. Oh well.

Through some strange twist of fate, he was arrested on suspicion of cheating and from there on, we see Jamal's life unravel in front of us as he recalls the answers to the questions.Much credit must be given to the child star Ayush Mahesh Khedekarwho plays the child Jamal, for his excellent and endearing portrayal of a slum child who lost his mother to religious insurgents. Along with his brother, Salim, they navigate their way through the streets, making money through the most ingenious ways while never forgetting the young girl, Latika, whose hand let go of his during an escape. The main cast also works well but it's really also A.R.

SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE just has that inscrutable ""something about it"" that makes it a true stand-out.Although it's often described as a ""feel-good"" movie, SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE also gives a starkly realistic portrait of the Mumbai slums, showing how life there (and any hope for something better) is left both to the individual and to chance.

Not only is the cinematography breathtaking (the realism and graphic imagery is searing), but the acting is amazing and the story is especially relevant to today's global situation (and the timing could not be more on point, considering the recent incident of terrorist violence in Mumbai).SLUMDOG is set in the slums of Mumbai, and follows young street urchin cum game show contestant, Jamal Malik (Dev Patel).  He has the chance to win the big rupee prize on the Indian version of WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE.  No one can believe that he is answering the questions correctly without cheating.  Malik is in love with Latika (Freida Pinto) who has been taken into  a gang members den, to be groomed as a prostitute, with her virginity to be auctioned off to the highest bidder.  They both come from poverty and profound pain.  Life has dealt them damn near impossible cards, and, yet, they keep on going with heads held high in the face of tremendous (and, at times excruciating) adversity.  We see Jamal's evolution from boy to man.  In the end, it is not the promise of money that does that to him.  It is, perhaps, something on a higher plane.I won't divulge any more details here.  You just need to see this film for yourself.  It will quite possibly change your life, the way you view your existence and also the life you are living and how you want to live it, as well as humbling all of us to the great bounty and possibility that exists in this world (regardless of class, caste, culture, ethnicity, religion or way of life).

Made on a relatively modest budget, it has captured the hearts and minds of moviegoers and garnered a fistful of Academy Award nominations. Jamal Malik, played with soulful sweetness by Dev Patel, grows up in Mumbai under wretched conditions. When their mother is killed, he and his older brother, Salim, scramble to stay alive by sleeping wherever they can, stealing food, and even allowing themselves to be duped by a Fagin-like con man. Latika is a homeless girl who teams up with Jamal and Salim, and the trio struggle mightily to get through each day. After enduring unspeakable hardships, Jamal grows up and takes a job in a call center. In an unlikely turn of events, the eighteen-year-old somehow becomes a contestant on ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"" To everyone's shock, this barely educated former street urchin comes up with some very unlikely answers and is on the verge of winning a fortune. Surely he must have cheated, but how?Directors Danny Boyle and Loveleen Tandan elicit touching performances from a fine cast. The lovely Freida Pinto plays Latika as a young woman who is badly treated by a thuggish gangster.  Jamal grows to worship her, but formidable obstacles stand in his way. The brothers soon veer off in different directions. Salim, played with menace and barely controlled rage by Madhur Mittal, turns on Jamal and the two become bitter enemies. Also worth mentioning is the wonderful Anil Kapoor, who brilliantly depicts the unctuous and phony host of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"" With a frozen smile, he pretends to be supportive of the calm and collected Jamal, while inside, he is seething with resentment and incredulity that this nobody is succeeding beyond all reason.The intriguing script by Simon Beaufoy is a fairy tale with a twist. ""Slumdog"" combines comedy, tragedy, music, and romance with such energy and excitement that we are willing to accept the surreal plot on its own terms. Somehow, this film would have us believe that in a chaotic world torn apart by violent religious fanatics, sadistic mobsters, brutal policemen, and exploiters of women and children, love and redemption are still possible.""Slumdog"" is helped immeasurably by its biting sardonic humor and pulsing and electrifying musical score. Boyle, along with his editor and cinematographer, deserve kudos for creating a world that is both repellent and seductive. Mumbai is a teeming city with many faces.  There are fetid slums filled with pitiful beggars, and brothels where young women are used and abused. On the other hand, businessmen in modern skyscrapers are attempting to transform India into a competitive global economic power. Although several appalling scenes make us want to avert our eyes, we cannot help but root for Jamal and Latika, two resilient and courageous youngsters who deserve the happiness and peace of mind that has been denied them by fate.",5,"""This is our destiny.""",1232582400,"01 22, 2009",2009,2935,"['Slumdog', 'Millionaire', 'become', 'sleeper', 'hit', 'Made', 'relatively', 'modest', 'budget', 'captured', 'hearts', 'minds', 'moviegoers', 'garnered', 'fistful', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominations', 'Jamal', 'Malik', 'played', 'soulful', 'sweetness', 'Dev', 'Patel', 'up', 'Mumbai', 'wretched', 'conditions', 'When', 'mother', 'killed', 'older', 'brother', 'Salim', 'scramble', 'stay', 'alive', 'sleeping', 'can', 'stealing', 'food', 'even', 'allowing', 'be', 'duped', 'Fagin-like', 'con', 'man', 'Latika', 'homeless', 'girl', 'who', 'up', 'Jamal', 'Salim', 'trio', 'struggle', 'mightily', 'get', 'day', 'enduring', 'unspeakable', 'hardships', 'Jamal', 'up', 'job', 'call', 'center', 'unlikely', 'turn', 'events', 'eighteen-year-old', 'somehow', 'contestant', 'Who', 'be', 'Millionaire', 'everyone', 'shock', 'barely', 'educated', 'former', 'street', 'urchin', 'up', 'very', 'unlikely', 'answers', 'verge', 'winning', 'fortune', 'Surely', 'must', 'have', 'cheated', 'how', 'Directors', 'Danny', 'Boyle', 'Loveleen', 'Tandan', 'touching', 'performances', 'fine', 'cast', 'lovely', 'Freida', 'Pinto', 'Latika', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'badly', 'treated', 'thuggish', 'gangster', 'Jamal', 'grows', 'worship', 'formidable', 'obstacles', 'stand', 'way', 'brothers', 'soon', 'veer', 'off', 'different', 'directions', 'Salim', 'played', 'menace', 'barely', 'controlled', 'rage', 'Madhur', 'Mittal', 'Jamal', 'two', 'become', 'bitter', 'enemies', 'Also', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'wonderful', 'Anil', 'Kapoor', 'who', 'brilliantly', 'unctuous', 'phony', 'host', 'Who', 'Be', 'Millionaire', 'frozen', 'smile', 'be', 'supportive', 'calm', 'collected', 'Jamal', 'inside', 'seething', 'resentment', 'incredulity', 'nobody', 'succeeding', 'reason.The', 'intriguing', 'script', 'Simon', 'Beaufoy', 'fairy', 'tale', 'twist', 'Slumdog', 'combines', 'comedy', 'tragedy', 'music', 'romance', 'such', 'energy', 'excitement', 'are', 'willing', 'accept', 'surreal', 'plot', 'own', 'terms', 'Somehow', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'chaotic', 'world', 'torn', 'apart', 'violent', 'religious', 'fanatics', 'sadistic', 'mobsters', 'brutal', 'policemen', 'exploiters', 'women', 'children', 'love', 'redemption', 'are', 'still', 'possible', 'Slumdog', 'helped', 'immeasurably', 'biting', 'sardonic', 'humor', 'pulsing', 'electrifying', 'musical', 'score', 'Boyle', 'editor', 'cinematographer', 'deserve', 'kudos', 'creating', 'world', 'repellent', 'seductive', 'Mumbai', 'teeming', 'city', 'many', 'are', 'fetid', 'slums', 'filled', 'pitiful', 'beggars', 'brothels', 'where', 'young', 'women', 'are', 'used', 'abused', 'other', 'hand', 'businessmen', 'modern', 'skyscrapers', 'are', 'attempting', 'transform', 'India', 'competitive', 'global', 'economic', 'power', 'several', 'appalling', 'scenes', 'make', 'want', 'avert', 'eyes', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'root', 'Jamal', 'Latika', 'two', 'resilient', 'courageous', 'youngsters', 'who', 'deserve', 'happiness', 'peace', 'mind', 'been', 'denied', 'fate']",N/A
1226149,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B001P9KR8U,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 4]","It's difficult to categorize a film that takes as many precariously driven dramatic turns as this 2008 picture directed by the versatile Danny Boyle. So why even bother since he manages to navigate fluidly between the feel-bad and feel-good extremes of Simon Beaufoy's (Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day) emotionally dense script with aplomb? The apt title refers to someone who grew up in the slums of Mumbai, and in this case, is on the verge of becoming very wealthy due to a serendipitous situation that leads him to be a finalist on the Hindi version of ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"" On the surface, the premise sounds rather silly, but the familiar game show, already a trivia footnote in this country, provides the catalyst for the vividly rendered events that unfold for one particular boy named Jamal Malik, a coffee carrier at a local telemarketing company. Contrivances aside, it is his life experiences that feed him the answers to the increasingly difficult questions, but the producers suspect a scam at work and have the police torture him in order to confess. What really emerges is Malik's undying devotion to his one true love, Latika, from whom he has long been estranged due to the desperate circumstances in her life.The movie's childhood flashbacks have a Dickens-level quality set against a cultural tableau unfamiliar to most of us. They focus on young Jamal and his older brother Salim, who are soon orphaned after their mother is killed for being a Muslim. They are joined by another abandoned orphan Latika, and together they dub themselves the Three Musketeers. They eventually find themselves indentured under the servitude of the deceptively kind Maman, who goes to extremes in keeping the children as street beggars. The brothers escape and eventually figure out how to scam tourists at the Taj Mahal, while Latika suffers the consequences of being left with Maman. The rest of the plot shows how the brothers diverge in values and how Latika becomes an unwilling mistress for a rival gang leader. Amazingly, Beaufoy's screenplay juxtaposes these spiraling events with the multiple-choice questions posed by Prem, the jocular ""Millionaire"" host, a popular figure who reveals his own sleazy underside in short order. There is such a swirl of activity with every episode in the film that there is little time to question the plausibility of the many plot turns because the resulting implausibility is what makes the movie so arresting.Boyle gives co-directing credit to Loveleen Tandan, previously a casting director specializing in India-themed films like Mira Nair'sMonsoon WeddingandVanity Fair, and it's obvious that the combination of their talents gives us a greater intimacy into India than one would expect from Boyle by himself. Other than his charming fable,Millions, there is little indication in Boyle's resume (the sci-fi shockerSunshine, the post-apocalyptic thriller28 Days Later, the drug-infestedTrainspotting) that he would have been capable of telling such a fanciful tale so convincingly. At the same time, the visual flourishes (thanks primarily to the stunning cinematography by Anthony Dod Mantel) and fast-cut editing reflect his familiar touches. The no-frills performances befit the story with Dev Patel bringing emotional focus to the grown Jamal and Frieda Pinto appropriately fetching as the grown Latika. Smaller roles are filled with a few more familiar faces with Indian movie icon Anil Koopar playing Prem and character actor Irrfan Khan (the father inThe Namesake) as the determined police inspector.

1226150,AIWDJ3S85O10Q,B001P9KR8U,Edward Aycock,"[0, 2]","I love this movie.  Chaotic, loud, colorful, frenzied and so many other adjectives, the Dickensian ""Slumdog Millionaire"" was one of my top choices of 2008.  I was so thrilled by the film after I first saw it that I brought a friend along with me the second time because I was afraid the movie would come and go too quickly for him to get another chance to see it.  The big surprise was when it started sweeping awards shows and emerged as the front runner for Best Picture at the Academy Awards.But much like Jamal Malik, the hero of this film, ""Slumdog Millionaire"" came out of (almost) nowhere and rose to the top during the 2008 awards season.  I say ""almost"" because director Danny Boyle was already known for such films as ""Shallow Grave,"" ""Trainspotting"" and ""28 Days Later.""  But ""Slumdog Millionaire"" made him even better known.  Heck, nearly every single member of my family saw this movie, and that never happens.  One of the real treats of this film is the performance by the youngest children who are excellent as children put into a precarious position in their lives.Some of the scenes of abuse and the rough life of the slums can be hard to watch for some, so let those be forewarned.  How accurately does this film depict reality for people in cities like Mumbai?  I can't really say.  There is criticism that this movie is unfair in its look at the brutal trials these children undergo, that it only shows the absolute worst but come on, how many films have ever been a perfect mirror?  ""Slumdog"" did not purport to be reality any more than ""Sex and the City"" tried to be a documentary of life in New York City.  (And thank God.)  I love this movie.  Ably assisted from the charismatic Dev Patel and Frieda Pinto as well as more established actors such as Anil Kapoor and Irfan Khan (who was wonderful in 2006's ""The Namesake""), this tale is one for the ages.

I have lived in Faridabad ( just outside of Deli), and have firsthand seen some of the things the film touched on. In the spirit of Mira Nair, Boyle opens ones eyes to this incredible country, but he doesn't sugar coat things like most Bollywood films ( which are basically musicals, some with depth others that are laughable but enjoyable nonetheless).Slumdog divulges what real India is like: a fight for survival, but one that has moments of beauty in it as well. Again, MOMENTS. The amount of children MUTILATED and forced by parents and others to work is disgusting. It is beyond belief. I was in the Deli area, and that has nothing on Calcutta or some of the bad areas of Mumbai.And despite this, one can see a beauty in these people that simply does not exist in the West. One brief scene ( SPOILER) in the movie when Dev is about to play the last round of Millionare, a woman on the street taps on his window and says 'go and win it all'. THIS type of genuine 'I'm happy for you', aka namaste, aka respect exists amongst the dire poverty.And then Slumdog dives into the Muslim-Hindu tension. In the kashmir region, fighting is horrendous. This type of confusion, dislike, and sometimes hatred exists between these two religions, and now with the recent terrorist attacks, things aren't looking too good.Slumdog Millionaire shows how hard working, diligent, determined, and driven many ( most) Indians are in their fight to survive and feed themselves/their families. The main character has to do this from when he was born, which is a sad reality for many infants/kids there.THE FILM IS ARTISTIC, FAST PACED AND TYPICAL BOYLE STYLE, WITH A GREAT SOUNDTRACK.Please watch it, and then DO something about what you have seen.

There's more to the story than this, but I really don't want to spoil anything. Other than being set in India, I never felt compelled to see this film, especially after the Totally Rad Show's verdict was not to seek it out, but my sister-in-law loved it enough to convince us, and it was definitely a pleasant surprise.Though the director isn't Indian so technically this isn't a Bollywood movie, I really wish that we had more Bollywood movies like this. A movie like this could definitely make an Indian man feel more proud about his country's cinema. I understand that Bollywood musicals have their place and I'm fine with that, I just wish it would produce films like this that cast India in this light that the world doesn't see: ugliness and beauty all at once permeating the streets. Any scenes that were set on the streets definitely gave me that vibe, and the cinematography was a big part of that. I didn't like how often the camera tried to give the audience a vertigo effect, but other than that it was quite impressive. The casting choices reminded me of Pan Labyrinth in that each one seemed to fit perfectly since these are actors/actresses you've never seen before and they do such a great job of portraying these characters that you don't imagine them in a world outside this movie. The music in this movie was also something that stood out to me: every song really held its own and they've since been stuck in my head at random times because their poignancy really resonated with me.If all those things weren't enough, it was one of those movies where we were talking about it long after we left the theater and debating motivations and plot points and such. Even though it can try to be too obvious at times with themes and symbols, you can forgive it because it tells the story so well. I was worried that parts of the movie would feel contrived, but I thought that things flowed rather smoothly. If I had one complaint about this film, it would probably be that the pacing felt a bit off. It definitely felt like a long movie, and it was only 2 hours long. I strongly recommend running out and catching this movie if it's playing in your city, or keeping it in mind to rent later this year if you can't see it now. I give it an A+ and say that it's worth seeking out because I feel like it tells a very unique story in a great way and it does suspense so well that I'd compare that element of it to the likes of 24.",5,If only Bollywood produced gems like this!,1231113600,"01 5, 2009",2009,2602,"['Essentially', 'movie', 'bum', 'who', 'become', 'millionaire', 'famous', 'TV', 'show', 'was', 'craze', 'India', 'shortly', 'was', 'big', 'US', 'more', 'story', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'anything', 'Other', 'being', 'set', 'India', 'never', 'felt', 'compelled', 'see', 'film', 'especially', 'Totally', 'Rad', 'Show', 'verdict', 'was', 'not', 'seek', 'out', 'sister-in-law', 'loved', 'enough', 'convince', 'was', 'definitely', 'pleasant', 'director', ""n't"", 'Indian', 'so', 'technically', ""n't"", 'Bollywood', 'movie', 'really', 'wish', 'had', 'more', 'Bollywood', 'movies', 'movie', 'could', 'definitely', 'make', 'Indian', 'man', 'feel', 'more', 'proud', 'country', 'cinema', 'understand', 'Bollywood', 'musicals', 'have', 'place', ""'m"", 'fine', 'just', 'wish', 'would', 'produce', 'films', 'cast', 'India', 'light', 'world', ""n't"", 'see', 'ugliness', 'beauty', 'once', 'permeating', 'streets', 'scenes', 'were', 'set', 'streets', 'definitely', 'gave', 'vibe', 'cinematography', 'was', 'big', 'part', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'how', 'often', 'camera', 'tried', 'give', 'audience', 'vertigo', 'effect', 'other', 'was', 'quite', 'impressive', 'casting', 'choices', 'reminded', 'Pan', 'Labyrinth', 'one', 'seemed', 'fit', 'perfectly', 'are', 'actors/actresses', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'portraying', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'world', 'movie', 'music', 'movie', 'was', 'also', 'something', 'stood', 'out', 'song', 'really', 'held', 'own', ""'ve"", 'been', 'stuck', 'head', 'random', 'times', 'poignancy', 'really', 'resonated', 'me.If', 'things', 'were', ""n't"", 'enough', 'was', 'one', 'movies', 'where', 'were', 'talking', 'long', 'left', 'theater', 'debating', 'motivations', 'plot', 'points', 'such', 'Even', 'can', 'try', 'be', 'too', 'obvious', 'times', 'themes', 'symbols', 'can', 'forgive', 'story', 'so', 'well', 'was', 'worried', 'parts', 'movie', 'would', 'feel', 'contrived', 'thought', 'things', 'flowed', 'rather', 'smoothly', 'had', 'one', 'complaint', 'film', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'pacing', 'felt', 'bit', 'off', 'definitely', 'felt', 'long', 'movie', 'was', 'only', '2', 'hours', 'long', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'running', 'out', 'catching', 'movie', 'playing', 'city', 'keeping', 'mind', 'rent', 'later', 'year', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'now', 'give', 'A+', 'say', 'worth', 'seeking', 'out', 'feel', 'very', 'unique', 'story', 'great', 'way', 'suspense', 'so', 'well', ""'d"", 'compare', 'element', 'likes', '24']",N/A

It doesn't follow the well-worn Hollywood conventions and stereotypes. The acting is heartwarming, not mushy. The characters take interesting and unexpected twists.The movie also teaches Western audiences (most of whom have never been to the slums of a developing country) about the struggles of life as a ""slumdog"" without lecturing or moralizing. In fact, at times, the movie turns heartbreaking situations into heartwarming ones. For example, in one scene, a little boy wants to see a famous movie star but is locked in a run-down outhouse, so he runs out of the outhouse, through the waste, and asks for the movie star's autograph while he is covered in poop.This is definitely one of the best movies of the past few years.

And while I enjoyed this movie, I wouldn't recommend seeing it more than once to anyone.  So I find the hyperbole surrounding ""Slumdog"" a little alarming.I am in total agreement with Salman Rushdie, who has called this movie ""visually brilliant.""  The cinematography is outstanding, kinetic, and the use of perspective and color to establish a scene is superb (in this regard, ""Slumdog"" reminds me of ""City of God,"" a better movie by far).  The soundtrack too is mesmerizing, loaded with pitch-perfect fusions of eastern and western music.  ""Slumdog"" is in this way every bit as good as ""Trainspotting,"" one of director Danny Boyle's best movies.Yet I also agree with Rushdie that ""Slumdog""'s biggest flaw is its storyline.  Perhaps in the context of Bollywood, a game show which asks questions drawing entirely from the contestant's experience is fine.  But when a western director makes a movie in which this happens, I have a sneaking suspicion that ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is the result of lazy storytelling.  One coincidence in a movie is almost necessary; two is starting to strain plausibility; the dozen or so in this movie alternately provoke indifference and cynicism.  While watching ""Slumdog,"" I realized that this was precisely my reaction to ""Forrest Gump,"" another movie which leans heavily on a succession of improbabilities.  The flashbacks, which in many movies can heighten tension, are sometimes ineffective because we know Jamal (the protagonist) survives these tense moments.The characterizations in this movie don't always help either.  Jamal's love interest, Latika, never seems to suffer anything worse than living with a rich guy.  And she only seems to care about Jamal when he has won ten million rupees, despite abundant evidence of his virtues beforehand.  Yet I am supposed to identify with her?""Slumdog Millionaire"" is probably worth seeing once, but its best attributes are also found in other movies.  It's better than ""The Kite Runner"" by a bit, but far worse than ""City of God.""

Bombay, from the perspective of the have-nots, is something straight out of a nightmare (Charles Dickens, eat your heart out). The only reason the beginning of the film wasn't overwhelming was because Jamal's childhood was meted out in flashbacks, which gave us an occasional rest as well as the assurance that everything might work out after all.I have to say that even knowing that a happy ending was probably in sight (this was an Indian film, after all), Slumdog Millionaire was nail-bitingly tense. There were moments when I actually wondered if our hero would get the quiz-show answer right, or if he would indeed ""get the girl,"" as heroes generally do.

We are taken through a series of flashbacks as he is questioned, and we learn about young Jamal's life with his brother, the difficulties and tragedies he's faced (such as the murder of his mother), the places he's been, and his initial meeting with childhood friend and eventual love, Latika. As perplexing as it seems, his ability to answer is based on some amazing coincidences, and he's also been able to find Latika several times and once even saves her from the clutches of a gangster. It seems that every time he catches up with her, fate intervenes and it is a short lived moment. The film moves back to the present, and the officers who interrogate the young man come to understand who he is. The two major conflicts within the story are: will Jamal be able to finally see Latika, his true love, and will he be the next millionaire. Certainly the love story takes precedent over his appearance on the show.There's a certain Dickens-like quality to the film, as it has amazing coincidences and a ""rags-to-riches"" feel to it. From the depths of poverty, the protagonist experiences pain in life but rebounds, and is given the chance of a lifetime.  There's also an aspect to the production where we cannot expect to take things at face value; things have a fantasy element to them, and the story can be likened to a parable about love or overcoming one's roadblocks in life.Slumdog Millionaire presents the often done ""rags to riches"" story in a unique manner and setting, and the film is worthy of its best picture status for 2008 (an award that has become a sham of late). Still, I felt that at some points the film dragged on a bit, and began to lose steam, and took some of the film's power with it. There is some violence, and some language, and the ""feel good"" label attached to Slumdog could be misleading without the resolution at the end.Over all, though, this is a film with heart, and its story was presented effectively.

The acting by three main characters especially by a newcomer, Dev Patel, is compelling. Patel plays a street kid Jamal Malik (Patel), an 18 year-old orphan from the slums of Mumbai, who made it to the Indian version of the TV show Who wants to be a millionaire?"" and keeps answering correctly every question. The secret is that every question represents a chapter of his own life, his growing up and surviving on the streets, his adventures and experiences often dramatic and even tragic. When he is just one question away from winning 20 million rupees (around $450,000), the time is up, and millions of TV-viewers who root for Jamal would have to wait for the following night to see him go for the big prize. Jamal is arrested by the police right after the game and he will spend the next day been rather brutally interrogated by police officers who want to find out how the street boy with no education can answer the difficult questions correctly. Fifteen years from the lives of Jamal, his older brother Salem and another orphan from the slums of Mumbai, ""the third musketeer"", the girl named Latika (Frieda Pinto), Jamal's true love since their childhood will reveal in flashbacks, and by the end of Jamal's story, it won't surprise us why he knows all answers. IMO, the only weak point in the story was the big 20 million rupees question. I won't reveal it but trust me, the whole reading or movie watching world knows the answer, and the question was too easy for such high stake BUT it fits the story very well, so I tend to be lenient.The best part of the movie is IMO the look at India from within, the glorious views of India's beauty and horrifying captures of its unspeakable poverty, from the slums of Mumbai and the dizzyingly crowded streets of Bombay to the heavenly magnificent Taj Mahal.Boyle's directing very much reminds Fernando Meirelles inspiring movie-making in Cidade de Deus aka City of God by its dynamism, fast and furious camera movements, and amazingly deep and compassionate understanding of the material",4,Three Musketeers from the slums of Mumbai,1342310400,"07 15, 2012",2012,2185,"['Slumdog', 'Millionaire', '2008', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'astounding', 'cinematography', 'virtuoso', 'directing', 'heartbreaking', 'yet', 'optimistic', 'story', 'acting', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'especially', 'newcomer', 'Dev', 'Patel', 'compelling', 'Patel', 'street', 'kid', 'Jamal', 'Malik', 'Patel', '18', 'year-old', 'orphan', 'slums', 'Mumbai', 'who', 'made', 'Indian', 'version', 'TV', 'show', 'Who', 'be', 'millionaire', 'answering', 'correctly', 'question', 'secret', 'question', 'chapter', 'own', 'life', 'growing', 'up', 'surviving', 'streets', 'adventures', 'experiences', 'often', 'dramatic', 'even', 'tragic', 'When', 'just', 'one', 'question', 'away', 'winning', '20', 'million', 'rupees', '450,000', 'time', 'up', 'millions', 'TV-viewers', 'who', 'root', 'Jamal', 'would', 'have', 'wait', 'following', 'night', 'see', 'go', 'big', 'prize', 'Jamal', 'arrested', 'police', 'right', 'game', 'will', 'spend', 'next', 'day', 'been', 'rather', 'brutally', 'interrogated', 'police', 'officers', 'who', 'want', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'street', 'boy', 'education', 'can', 'answer', 'difficult', 'questions', 'correctly', 'Fifteen', 'years', 'lives', 'Jamal', 'older', 'brother', 'Salem', 'orphan', 'slums', 'Mumbai', 'third', 'musketeer', 'girl', 'named', 'Latika', 'Frieda', 'Pinto', 'Jamal', 'true', 'love', 'childhood', 'will', 'reveal', 'flashbacks', 'end', 'Jamal', 'story', 'wo', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'why', 'answers', 'IMO', 'only', 'weak', 'point', 'story', 'was', 'big', '20', 'million', 'rupees', 'question', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'trust', 'whole', 'reading', 'movie', 'watching', 'world', 'answer', 'question', 'was', 'too', 'easy', 'such', 'high', 'stake', 'BUT', 'story', 'very', 'well', 'tend', 'be', 'lenient.The', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'IMO', 'look', 'India', 'glorious', 'views', 'India', 'beauty', 'horrifying', 'captures', 'unspeakable', 'poverty', 'slums', 'Mumbai', 'dizzyingly', 'crowded', 'streets', 'Bombay', 'heavenly', 'magnificent', 'Taj', 'Mahal.Boyle', 'directing', 'very', 'much', 'reminds', 'Fernando', 'Meirelles', 'inspiring', 'movie-making', 'Cidade', 'de', 'Deus', 'aka', 'City', 'God', 'dynamism', 'fast', 'furious', 'camera', 'movements', 'amazingly', 'deep', 'compassionate', 'understanding', 'material']",N/A

His latest film, ""Slumdog Millionaire"", is undeniably enjoyable.  Each member of the cast was excellent, Boyle himself was in top form, and the plot was well-constructed.  However, I felt that the film lacked any real sense of social commentary on the issue of poverty.Poverty in the East, and certainly in India, is a gruesome and desperate state that most people in the Western world can barely fathom.  ""Slumdog"" never truly addresses this problem.  Based on the conversations I've had with people who enjoyed this film, most of them are struck by the horrendous living conditions of the three main characters only momentarily, and then their shock is seemingly swept away by the inspirational ending.  Poverty and its effects of disease, illiteracy, desperate hunger, and social exclusion does not seem to resonate with many viewers.  The film does not instill any sense of urgency about the issue, which is a shame considering that there are approximately 2.8 billion people in the world who live at least as badly, and in many cases worse, than the film's main characters.So, if you're looking for a great story, then you can do much worse than ""Slumdog Millionaire"".

The transitions are smooth, and they resemble quite a bit, so it makes it believable.The storyline is made up of a series of back flashes that give you the background story of Jamal. A key element that ties the story together is Jamal's undying love for Latika, who he eventually wins over.The Bad: Latika becomes the servant of a gangster, and when she tries to run away, her face is scarred. Women are undermined in this film and treated more like property to be used and abused at will, rather than equal human beings. (Maybe this has to do with the Indian culture).The Ugly: What I found quite disturbing about this film is the over-emphasis on the cruelty shown to children. Displayed is the deliberate blinding of children so that when they go begging they would get twice as much. Additionally young Jamal is shown jumping into a sewerage pit and is totally covered in filth.

1226176,A2UYAFQ40U2PHS,B001P9KR8U,"Grigory's Girl ""GR""","[2, 4]","Slumdog Millionare is a good film, but it is also a very overrated film, and a rather simplistic one.  There are some amazing things in it, but there are some incredibly dull ones as well.Like all of Danny Boyle's films, there is some truly astonishing imagery in this film.  The shots of Mumbai's slums are brilliantly shot (the cinematographer, Anthony Dod Mantle, deservedly won an Oscar for his work).  Boyle and company deserve kudos for these scenes, as they are rarely seen in feature filmmaking, and are hardly ever seen in contemporary Bollywood films.  There is also a scene where the children go to an opera, and steal wallets and purses from under the bleachers.  This scene is achingly beautiful, and I wish it was longer.  There are many shots like that in this film.  Boyle has always had an amazing eye, especially in Trainspotting and 28 Days Later.  But too often Boyle dazzles us with eye candy, and his films end up being unrelenting hollow, and Slumdog Millionare is no exception.The script of this film is predictable and, especially in the 2nd half of the film, surprisingly boring.  There is a love story at the heart of the film, and it feels forced, like it doesn't belong there, like the filmmakers insisted that it have some sort of love story in it, like typical Bollywood films do.  The dialogue is very forgettable, and the characters (except for Dev Patel's character) are cartoonish and very one note.  Boyle's array of dazzling images suddenly disappears in the 2nd half when he concentrates on the love story, and he's left with just the story, which is very uncompelling, even though it should be.  The motivation of the TV host is also strange, as it doesn't make any real sense other than to give the story an unnecessary twist.Most of the performances are adequate, but the best one is by Dev Patel.  While he has the classic Bollywood look, you do believe that his character was raised in the slums, and he has a certain anger and sadness that makes you feel for him.  One of the most fascinating things about this film is the jarring (intentionally) juxaposition between Patel's interrogation (he's tortured by the police rather brutally), Patel's life in the slums (which is all done in flashback), and the slick, hollowness of the TV show Who Wants to be a Millionare?.  It works very well, but it's predominantly in the first half, and the 2nd half is much more conventional and quite staid by comparison.The musical score is quite good, especially the end credits song/dance, which is one of the highlights of the film.I think this is another Best Picture Oscar winner that people will question in future years.  Too often the Oscars is not about which is really the best film of the year, but about politics (like great directors like Scorsese winning for mediocre films like The Departed instead of winning for Goodfellas, a true masterpiece), and/or momentum (Slumdog Millionare's wins were all about having momentum and riding a tide, so to speak).  It's not a bad movie at all, but it really is not a fantastic film by any stretch of the imagination.

1226180,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B001P9KR8U,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 4]","Mumbai, a frenetic metropolis and home to 14 or 15 million inhabitants, certainly boasts its share of glitz and glitter. It is the entertainment and commercial capital of India. It is home to Bollywood. But flip that coin over and you'll find the less glamourous side, that Mumbai also happens to be the site of some pretty deplorable living conditions. The poverty and squalor - and the quality of life attached to that - are horrific. And I guess it makes the ideal backdrop for SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE, a film of seemingly relentless bleakness but a film which ultimately champions hope, love, destiny, and the tenacity of the human spirit.The plot is this: Improbably, Jamal Malik (Dev Patel), an uneducated young chai wallah (tea server) from the slums of Mumbai, is one correct answer away from winning it all on the Indian version of the game show Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? But time runs out for that evening's episode and the flabbergasted audience must wait one more evening to see if Jamal can win the big prize. But Jamal is arrested and tortured, on the suspicion of cheating. Because how can a mere slumdog advance so far in the quiz show when even scholars before him have all failed ignominiously?The conceit of the movie lies in that each of Jamal's responses to the game show questions ties into a significant moment in his past. As Jamal reluctantly explains to the Mumbai police, the film flashes back to his painful childhood in the Mumbai slums. In the past, we meet his older brother Salim, a bully and avaricious and who soon becomes jealous of Jamal's close friendship with the young orphaned girl Latika. We see these three endure tragic life-changing experiences, as Jamal, Salim, and Latika claw out an existence by begging, stealing, and hustling naive tourists. Down the years, the three separate and reunite several times. Yet one thing never changes. Jamal keeps faith, believing that he and Latika are destined to be together. And that is the heart of the film.Based on Vikas Swarup's novelQ & A: A Novel, SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE is graced with dazzling technical mastery. Danny Boyle directs it and makes the thing accessible for western eyes. And, yet, the film does still feature a few of the core elements so favored by Indian cinema. Most notable is the gulf between classes, with the lead character so lowborn that when he achieves something seemingly beyond his capability, his integrity is promptly doubted and he is brutalized. Also regard the sweeping, star-crossed romance, that theme of love surmounting all odds, most definitely a staple of Bollywood's. And, while SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE is by no means a musical, Danny Boyle couldn't resist putting in an exuberant dance number ""Jai Ho,"" staged during the closing credits.The story is solid, the hook is good. The film looks visually charged. It's sharply edited, with awesome cinematography, with the cameras capturing the bustle and energy and vibrancy of Mumbai, whether the focus is on the slums or on the city's rapid phases of globalization. The pulsating soundtrack contributes to the emotional texture of the thing (although I laughed when ""Aaj Ki Raat"" from DON came out, since I just saw DON again very recently). The actors are marvelous, with Dev Patel strong as the central character. The film covers three stages in Jamal's life, when he was roughly 7, 13, and 18. The children who play Jamal, Salim, and Latika are terrific, particularly Ayush Mahesh Khedekar and Rubina Ali, who are very moving as Jamal and Latika at seven years of age. There is one moment which crystallizes Jamal's personality to the audience and young Ayush pulls it off perfectly, this being the outhouse scene and what Jamal goes thru to nab an autograph from his Bollywood idol Amitabh Bachchan. Really, from that point on, you're totally on this kid's side. SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE is essentially a flashback film, with the game show sequences used as a framing device. And, ultimately, it's the honest performances of the children which hooks you in. Fair warning, there are some very disturbing scenes played out during these kids' time on screen.Two other actors make an impact. One is veteran Bollywood actor Anil Kapoor and his trademark mustache. He plays the smug game show host, himself born out of the slums and who doesn't want Jamal to win the game and upstage him. Meanwhile, Freida Pinto makes an auspicious debut as the present-day Latika. She doesn't really have a lot of scenes or a lot of lines, compared to Dev Patel, but she makes them count. Freida Pinto is stunning. She has a presence and flashes such an utterly winning smile that the film flashes back to it several times. With her as Latika, I get how Jamal just never wavers in his efforts to reunite with her. Although, to be fair, Jamal fell in love with Latika before she grew up to look like Freida Pinto.What I have is the single disc version, with the following special features: the Making of the Film featurette (23 minutes long); 12 deleted scenes, all worth watching and key to filling in several gaps in the film - definitely check out ""The Folder,"" which reveals why the Police Inspector dealt with Jamal in the way he did; two audio commentaries, one with Director Danny Byole & actor Dev Patel, the other with producer Christian Colson & screenplay writer Simon Beaufoy; and the ""Slumdog Cutdown"" segment, which basically is a series of scenes from the film serving as a synopsis and set to the exhilarating song ""Jai Ho.""As someone who's watched Indian cinema for a few years now, I'm so happy this film came out and I hope that it'll whet the appetites of more westerners, intrigue them enough so that they dip their toe into Bollywood films or Tamil films or Telugu. But if you're not sure yet and you're looking for a more accessible intro to Indian cinema, you should probably check out frothier films likeBride and PrejudiceandOther End of the Line (Widescreen). Word to the wise, the Indian film industries tend to produce films which lean towards the more colorful, exuberant, and unabashedly over-the-top and sentimental, so prep yourself if you want to indulge in the real thing. I also recommendSwades, an awesome film which attempts to make a telling statement about the state of poverty and the lack of education in India. SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE ended up winning a busload of Oscar awards, and justifiably so. In this film's depiction of the state of things with the poorer masses, I quote from a slumdog in the film as he is about to get trounced by the Indian constabulary in front of American tourists: ""You wanted to see a bit of the real India - here it is!"" SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE shows not all, but only a bit of the real India.

1226184,A3RFXU3P0XKKF4,B001P9KR8U,"Herbert L Calhoun ""paulocal""","[7, 24]","If most Americans are like me, they will associate the term ""slumdog"" with the term ""slumlord,"" as in a  ""dog of a slumlord. I initially thought the word referred to a ""slumlord dog"" -- that is a slumlord that had a doggish reputation for failing to keep up run-down properties rented to the poor at unseemly profits. However, ""slumdog,"" in the context of Indian society, is a derogatory label given to the lowest of the ""untouchable caste:"" the mostly street orphans and wretched waifs and urban denizens that rule the streets by day and night and live on (and off of) the dumps of trash of most Indian cities.The plot, upon which the movie hangs, is the story of an endearing ""slumdog"" named Jamal who upon reaching adulthood, accidently manages to get on the Indian version of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. "" And as he progresses up the ladder towards the magic jackpot, the host becomes suspicious and reports him to the local authorities on suspicions of cheating. As a result, the game show contestant is called into the nearest police station for interrogation. And the rest of the movie consists of flashbacks of the interrogation, which soon reveals that, associated with each of his answers, is a corresponding incident in Jamal's earlier life as a street urchin, that predicts with a certainty to each of his correct answers. The cleverness of the movie is that the game show motif becomes just a pretext for exposing the many horrors of the violence of poverty of Jamal's childhood as a ""slumdog"" on the streets of Mumbai, and by extension it is a broader expose of the poverty of the underclass of Indian society, more generally.Despite my initial apprehensions about the movie after misunderstanding the true meaning of the term ""slumdog,"" I wanted to be seduced by this movie. But this was not to be. For the movie shocked me into a corrected understanding of the term ""slumdog"" with a negative act of symbolic vulgarness that could be interpreted in only one way: as the dark mean-spirited political undertones of a ""caste-conscious"" culture.The incident in question involves a prank by his friends, in which the eight year-old, Jamal gets locked in an outhouse and he has no exit except to take the dive and come up through the toilet hole dripping with fecal slime from head to toe. He then proceeds to run smiling through a crowded street with hundreds of other kids, and somehow manages to get the signature of his movie hero, still draped unnoticed by the crowd in this dripping, stinking, unhealthy fecal robe.What a metaphor for an uncaring society!This scene is the most powerful, if not the pivotal scene of the movie, because symbolically it sets the context, the subtext and the pretext of the rather thin and syrupy melodrama that follows. Next to this opening image, the quiz show motif is little more than a handy vehicle for ""allowing"" the wretched ""to be seen"" achieving a modicum of success in a society where it is fully recognized that it is next to impossible to do so.  A society where the only normal routes to ""upward mobility"" for these ""outcasts"" is crime and scheming. The callousness of Indian society is normalized through the shock treatment of the ""outhouse scene"" and then thereafter relegated to the background. After the fecal robe parade, nothing about Indian society can be more shocking or vulgar. This one scene inoculates Indian society from any responsibility for what happens to its poor.With this shock treatment, it is difficult not to be disturbed throughout the movie by this image of an eight year old walking in public dripping in a fecal robe. For in my mind, that robe points to the deeper and darker political motives of the moviemakers: After that scene, it is no longer an uplifting comedy, but a mean-spirited behind the scene ""caste conscious"" political movie manipulated by the upper classes to maintain the rules of the status quo intact, even as it weaves an unreal story of improbable success for a slumdog. And although it's deeper and darker political messages are cleverly tucked behind the syrupy facile melodramatic Bollywood quiz show motif, one that ends happily with the street urchin getting the girl and living happily ever after, the movie is fun, only if you turn your blinders off to the savagery of the poverty and violence of everyday life of the Indian underclass. I could not.The unmistakable message embedded in the context is that no one cares that millions of orphaned kids run around each day in wretched, violent poverty, having their limbs severed and their eyes gouged out, their organs sold, all for profits for those on the next level up the class ladder. No one cares if they run the streets with no clothes, no where to live, even in fecal robes. The point of the movie is to desensitize the moviegoer to the fact that in India, poverty is like the grass, a part of the national landscape, most Indians are over it: so the movie's appeal is for the moviegoer to also to just get over it too. Some of us could not.The subtext is equally clear, the movie attempts to expose, even as it ""tiptoes around"" the edges of the ""uber sensitivities"" of the caste warfare going on today, the utter hopelessness of trying to rise above ones own station in Indian society. Although the motif of ""fictionally allowing"" the wretched to rise up for a fleeting moment of ""upward mobility"" via a TV game show is clever, it belies the truth of Indian society. Plus, that triumph is accidental and occurs by societal and artistic fiat, and even under these odd circumstances, still the success immediately comes under suspicion as involving some kind of ""slumdog"" trickery.If this shallow, slick, movie wins an Oscar I will be very disappointed.Three stars",3,The Title says it all,1233446400,"02 1, 2009",2009,5738,"['most', 'Americans', 'are',

1226189,A1RDPBXEFS35K9,B001P9KR8U,H. Paul Moon,"[6, 8]","So I just sat down with Slumdog Millionaire for the first time.  Even if I adore the cinematic medium, I avoid the Academy Awards like the plague, and when that time came I decided to watch this film instead which happens to have won in 2009's major categories.  As the film came out, I was into the thick of travel, and moreover the film didn't seem to me like a good fit for Danny Boyle's style.  No less, it is one of those films about foreign poverty, with a grand conscience, and those can just turn out awful.  My perception is that, inevitably, people patronized (and then patronized) the film with work-righteous emotions fit for the occasion, and its distributors piled onto that package with the moniker that it was the ""feel-good movie of the year.""  No thanks.But I watched it anyway, because it was just remastered onto Blu-Ray and I became an admirer of Danny Boyle's wild directorial style from his science fiction masterpiece Sunshine, which ranks with Kubrick's 2001 and Tarkovsky's Solaris as perfected speculative fiction, lacking any mess of cowboys and indians in space with noises magically permeating vacuums.Something surprised me about Slumdog Millionaire, though I ultimately found it flawed from its failure to resist utter sappiness with a hyper-romantic disregard of reality (too many perfect coincidences; it might as well have tried to be a Greek drama about gods and fates).  The surprise for me was in its brash, stylistic disregard for the culture.  Boyle shot the film with agitated camera movements, super-wide-angle lenses (practically fish-eyed), avant-garde compositions, skewed framings, and so forth -- in other words, idiomatic to Boyle's modernist style.  Yet, if the original vision were that of the typical Birkenstock-armored documentarian (I am surrounded by them), all of these stylistic measures would be a violation.  It is in fact only at the end of the film (train station dancing sequence) where the Hindi cultural sensibility of Bollywood bridges the gap, and it becomes a merged work of cinema.And that is the whole point.  A Westerner visiting India arrives a Westerner and leaves a Westerner -- show me exceptions and I'll show you a skeptic.  The pretense of all filmmakers, composers, authors and visual artists who immerse themselves for the purpose of divining native art is perfectly inauthentic.  (Notably, my favorite living composer, Philip Glass, ""invented"" the last major movement in serious contemporary music -- Minimalism -- under the guidance of Ravi Shankar when tasked with transcribing microtonal indigenous ragas into Western notation.  Minimalism, and Glass's Minimalism, does not sound Indian, yet those Eastern fingerprints are all over the place.)It only increased my otherwise simple affection for the film when I surfed around a bit only to find significant mass criticism against it for failing (in one fell swoop?) to ""capture"" the spirit and the desolation of Mumbai.  I also find it comical as well as hypocritical that many are quite furious to know that the untrained child actors are still living amidst the depicted poverty.  Surely they can only be prosperous and happy in comparison to Western standards of heavyweight wealth!  And surely, snatching them from that ""slumdog"" environment will solve it all.",3,A Western film that finds virtue in being a Western film,1268179200,"03 10, 2010",2010,3296,"['So', 'just', 'sat', 'down', 'Slumdog', 'Millionaire', 'first', 'time', 'Even', 'adore', 'cinematic', 'medium', 'avoid', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'plague', 'when', 'time', 'came', 'decided', 'watch', 'film', 'instead', 'have', 'won', '2009', 'major', 'categories', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'thick', 'travel', 'moreover', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'good', 'fit', 'Danny', 'Boyle', 'style', 'less', 'one', 'films', 'foreign', 'poverty', 'grand', 'conscience', 'can', 'just', 'turn', 'out', 'awful', 'perception', 'inevitably', 'people', 'patronized', 'then', 'patronized', 'film', 'work-righteous', 'emotions', 'fit', 'occasion', 'distributors', 'piled', 'package', 'moniker', 'was', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'year', 'thanks.But', 'watched', 'anyway', 'was', 'just', 'remastered', 'Blu-Ray', 'became', 'admirer', 'Danny', 'Boyle', 'wild', 'directorial', 'style', 'science', 'fiction', 'masterpiece', 'Sunshine', 'Kubrick', '2001', 'Tarkovsky', 'Solaris', 'perfected', 'speculative', 'fiction', 'lacking', 'mess', 'cowboys', 'indians', 'space', 'noises', 'magically', 'permeating', 'vacuums.Something', 'surprised', 'Slumdog', 'Millionaire', 'ultimately', 'found', 'flawed', 'failure', 'resist', 'utter', 'sappiness', 'hyper-romantic', 'disregard', 'reality', 'too', 'many', 'perfect', 'coincidences', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'tried', 'be', 'Greek', 'drama', 'gods', 'fates', 'surprise', 'was', 'brash', 'stylistic', 'disregard', 'culture', 'Boyle', 'shot', 'film', 'agitated', 'camera', 'movements', 'super-wide-angle', 'lenses', 'practically', 'fish-eyed', 'avant-garde', 'compositions', 'skewed', 'framings', 'so', 'forth', 'other', 'words', 'idiomatic', 'Boyle', 'modernist', 'style', 'original', 'vision', 'were', 'typical', 'Birkenstock-armored', 'documentarian', 'am', 'surrounded', 'stylistic', 'measures', 'would', 'be', 'violation', 'fact', 'only', 'end', 'film', 'train', 'station', 'dancing', 'sequence', 'where', 'Hindi', 'cultural', 'sensibility', 'Bollywood', 'gap', 'merged', 'work', 'cinema.And', 'whole', 'point', 'Westerner', 'visiting', 'India', 'Westerner', 'Westerner', 'show', 'exceptions', ""'ll"", 'show', 'skeptic', 'pretense', 'filmmakers', 'composers', 'authors', 'visual', 'artists', 'who', 'immerse', 'purpose', 'divining', 'native', 'art', 'perfectly', 'inauthentic', 'Notably', 'favorite', 'living', 'composer', 'Philip', 'Glass', 'invented', 'last', 'major', 'movement', 'serious', 'contemporary', 'music', 'Minimalism', 'guidance', 'Ravi', 'Shankar', 'when', 'tasked', 'transcribing', 'microtonal', 'indigenous', 'ragas', 'Western', 'notation', 'Minimalism', 'Glass', 'Minimalism', 'not', 'sound', 'Indian', 'yet', 'Eastern', 'fingerprints', 'are', 'place', 'only', 'increased', 'otherwise', 'simple', 'affection', 'film', 'when', 'surfed', 'bit', 'only', 'find', 'significant', 'mass', 'criticism', 'failing', 'one', 'fell', 'swoop', 'capture', 'spirit', 'desolation', 'Mumbai', 'also', 'find', 'comical', 'as', 'well', 'hypocritical', 'many', 'are', 'quite', 'furious', 'know', 'untrained', 'child', 'actors', 'are', 'still', 'living', 'depicted', 'poverty', 'Surely', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'prosperous', 'happy', 'comparison', 'Western', 'standards', 'heavyweight', 'wealth', 'surely', 'snatching', 'slumdog', 'environment', 'will', 'solve']",N/A

I was going to go watch it again a couple more times and was going to urge all my friends, colleagues, and family to go watch it. But now that I have found out that the movie was never a fiction for these children, I cannot.Note to Mr. Danny Boyle: You are a pretty good director, but it wasn't merely your talent that made this movie great, and the teenage and adult actors were not that impressive. You would not have gotten this kind of outcome without this particular group of children. I guess that is precisely why you chose them in the first place.Let's say somebody made a wonderful horror movie where several people meet horrible endings, and it is really a good movie. How many people do you think can sit through the movie, knowing what they are seeing is those unfortunate people dying in reality? I feel kind of the same way about this movie.The movie is really good, but for it to be entertainment, the people who control the money from this movie should seriously give more consideration to how to better take care of these wonderful children, who were the best part of the movie.As it is right now, the makers and distributors of this movie are peddling these children's real-life misery for their own fame and fortune, and that is pretty low.

Is it the hype? I don't know.  If I had never heard of this film, and had seen it on the IFC or Sundance channel, I would have thought it was a slightly below average indie film.  I guess seeing some kid jump into a pool of ""Sh-T"" to get a Bollywood actor's autograph, and later selling it shows how one survives in abject poverty, but isn't that what every film showing survival on the 'streets' is about? Our little hero defies everyone's expectations by seeming to know the answers to challening questions on the popular game show, even though he's an uneducated slumdog; but he learned a lot of info. through his life experience. Big deal. People have been saying Shakespeare couldn't have written Shakespeare because the Bard wasn't sufficiently educated. Of course our protagonist also has 'street smarts' as well as 'trivia smarts,' showing he's an all around cool guy, and is able to survive terrible ordeals and evil people. This is the oldest plot line in the book, probably the oldest in every book.  Then you toss in some goofy romantic interest story about being in love with a girl forced into prostitution, and you have yet another cliche.

They have to answer that unfair competition from the deprived Indians and go directly on their turf, since we can't really speak of a lawn, and bring the biblical truth to those pagans. That's what I found most fascinating at first: the image of the USA seen through the filter of Mumbai. First, make some simple questions fuzzy and difficult to capture. Moslems and Hindus are sure there but we don't know who is who. They speak the same language. No more difference really between Urdu and Hindi. Only the names of the main characters sound Moslem, that's all and the anti-Moslem pogrom or riot is just an unclear detail, especially since the dregs of this society are them, the Moslems. First serious blurred issue. The second is of course the problem of the Untouchables, the Dalits. They cannot be Moslems since they are a Hindu caste. And sure enough our characters who are living in the ""slums"" or shantytown, on the pile of garbage, are not Hindus, hence are not Untouchables. Then we are surprised because taking care of toilets is one of the tasks of these untouchables, or doing the washing for the fortunate who can afford that kind of service. So where are they? Invisible of course, but not in a city like Mumbai where there must be several millions of them. The episode of the little kid jumping into the toilet hole is just unthinkable for a Moslem child. If we go on with that fuzziness, we find out that the orphanage must be on the side of evil, since exploiting the Moslem orphans, hence Hindu. And the gangster who recuperates one of the boys when they are running away from the orphanage people after saving the girl and killing the main organizer of that begging and whoring ring, since he defines himself as the friend of the enemy of his enemies, must be Moslem. All that is unclear and that is done on purpose and it keeps some ambiguity about the Moslems in India without giving the slightest real knowledge about the real situation in India. But then of course we can speak of India itself and of its emergence from the mud-pit of the world. The picture that is given there is this time a reflection of and on what the West was fifty years ago, and some will say still are. Anything is good for these super poor people to do something to improve their lot, essentially by using any kind of opportunity that comes along that is half honest and half dishonest, like borrowing something that has been left somewhere like shoes at the entrance of a temple, but with the firm intention of not bringing them back and of making them circulate further for a little profit. This great poverty is not at all nurturing resignation but all the opposite, determination and the will to gamble everything to get up at least one step if not two. The film is entirely centered on a TV game, Questions and Answers that can lead the winner to 20 million Rupees. A game of punctual knowledge for a lot of money and nothing else. And yet out of that game popular fame is produced, the conviction that you can never keep people down longer than they will decide, that the survival instinct is nothing because it leads to killing, but the instinct to improve one's lot is a lot more stronger because it is supposed to lead to improving your lot in society itself. Then the story is of course a comedy because of the love affair that is intertwined and entangled in that story and the rewriting of Stephen King's ""Running Man"" (with Schwarzenegger) has become pleasant and even funny and not the gruesome drama of the model. The final scene is a typical Bollywood scene with hundreds of actors and actresses dancing in Mumbai's Victoria Station and it is some kind of cherry to top off the ice cream. This film will entertain you deeply if you try to use your brain to see the social discourse that is hiding behind the flashy and colorful surface.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",5,Emerging or submerging,1232841600,"01 25, 2009",2009,4082,"['America', 'mean', 'United', 'States', 'America', 'are', 'changing', 'sides', 'Hollywood', 'Bollywood', 'have', 'answer', 'unfair', 'competition', 'deprived', 'Indians', 'go', 'directly', 'turf', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'speak', 'lawn', 'bring', 'biblical', 'truth', 'pagans', 'what', 'found', 'most', 'fascinating', 'first', 'image', 'USA', 'seen', 'filter', 'Mumbai', 'First', 'make', 'simple', 'questions', 'fuzzy', 'difficult', 'capture', 'Moslems', 'Hindus', 'are', 'sure', 'there', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'who', 'speak', 'same', 'language', 'more', 'difference', 'really', 'Urdu', 'Hindi', 'Only', 'names', 'main', 'characters', 'sound', 'Moslem', 'anti-Moslem', 'pogrom', 'riot', 'just', 'unclear', 'detail', 'especially', 'dregs', 'society', 'are', 'Moslems', 'First', 'serious', 'blurred', 'issue', 'second', 'course', 'problem', 'Untouchables', 'Dalits', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'Moslems', 'are', 'Hindu', 'caste', 'sure', 'enough', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'living', 'slums', 'shantytown', 'pile', 'garbage', 'are', 'not', 'Hindus', 'hence', 'are', 'not', 'Untouchables', 'Then', 'are', 'surprised', 'taking', 'care', 'toilets', 'one', 'tasks', 'untouchables', 'doing', 'washing', 'fortunate', 'who', 'can', 'afford', 'kind', 'service', 'where', 'are', 'Invisible', 'course', 'not', 'city', 'Mumbai', 'where', 'must', 'be', 'several', 'millions', 'episode', 'little', 'kid', 'jumping', 'toilet', 'hole', 'just', 'unthinkable', 'Moslem', 'child', 'go', 'fuzziness', 'find', 'out', 'orphanage', 'must', 'be', 'side', 'evil', 'exploiting', 'Moslem', 'orphans', 'hence', 'Hindu', 'gangster', 'who', 'one', 'boys', 'when', 'are', 'running', 'away', 'orphanage', 'people', 'saving', 'girl', 'killing', 'main', 'organizer', 'begging', 'whoring', 'ring', 'friend', 'enemy', 'enemies', 'must', 'be', 'Moslem', 'unclear', 'done', 'purpose', 'ambiguity', 'Moslems', 'India', 'giving', 'slightest', 'real', 'knowledge', 'real', 'situation', 'India', 'then', 'course', 'can', 'speak', 'India', 'emergence', 'mud-pit', 'world', 'picture', 'given', 'time', 'reflection', 'what', 'West', 'was', 'fifty', 'years', 'ago', 'will', 'say', 'still', 'are', 'Anything', 'good', 'super', 'poor', 'people', 'do', 'something', 'improve', 'lot', 'essentially', 'using', 'kind', 'opportunity', 'half', 'honest', 'half', 'dishonest', 'borrowing', 'something', 'been', 'left', 'somewhere', 'shoes', 'entrance', 'temple', 'firm', 'intention', 'not', 'bringing', 'back', 'making', 'circulate', 'further', 'little', 'profit', 'great', 'poverty', 'not', 'nurturing', 'resignation', 'opposite', 'determination', 'will', 'gamble', 'everything', 'get', 'up', 'least', 'one', 'step', 'not', 'two', 'film', 'entirely', 'centered', 'TV', 'game', 'Questions', 'Answers', 'can', 'lead', 'winner', '20', 'million', 'Rupees', 'game', 'punctual', 'knowledge', 'lot', 'money', 'nothing', 'else', 'yet', 'game', 'popular', 'fame', 'produced', 'conviction', 'can', 'never', 'keep', 'people', 'down', 'longer', 'will', 'decide', 'survival', 'instinct', 'nothing', 'killing', 'instinct', 'improve', 'one', 'lot', 'lot', 'more', 'stronger', 'supposed', 'lead', 'improving', 'lot', 'society', 'Then', 'story', 'course', 'comedy', 'love', 'affair', 'intertwined', 'entangled', 'story', 'rewriting', 'Stephen', 'King', 'Running', 'Man', 'Schwarzenegger', 'become', 'pleasant', 'even', 'funny', 'not', 'gruesome', 'drama', 'model', 'final', 'scene', 'typical', 'Bollywood', 'scene', 'hundreds', 'actors', 'actresses', 'dancing', 'Mumbai', 'Victoria', 'Station', 'kind', 'cherry', 'top', 'off', 'ice', 'cream', 'film', 'will', 'entertain', 'deeply', 'try', 'use', 'brain', 'see', 'social', 'discourse', 'hiding', 'flashy', 'colorful', 'surface.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', 'Dauphine', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Versailles', 'Saint', 'Quentin', 'Yvelines']",N/A
1226195,A1A535W556ROBQ,B001P9KR8U,James Ferguson,"[2, 3]","Danny Boyle certainly knows how to tell a good story as he weaves together an entertaining yarn of growing up hard in Mumbai.  He builds the plot around ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"" using the questions to reveal Jamal's hard life, as the chaiwalla seems to know all the right answers much to the chagrin of the host, Prem Kumar.It takes a little while to get on track but Boyle and Loveleen Tandan never lose sight of their characters, charting a course that has a number of amazing twists and turns.  While Jamal never gives up his pursuit for the lovely Latika, his older brother Salim is the one who figures out how to get them out of one jam after another, but not always to Jamal's liking.  Some of the scenes are pretty harrowing, as one would expect from being forced to live on the street after Jamal's and Salim's mother is beaten to death in a race riot, but ultimately Boyle keeps to the spirit of Bollywood moreso than Dickens.The cast is an intriguing mix of first-time actors and Bollywood stars, as fantasy meets reality.  I can see why the movie is such a favorite among audiences. One would have to be pretty callous not to give into the kinetic energy of the movie, and let yourself be taken along on this wild ride.

1226196,A1RECBDKHVOJMW,B001P9KR8U,"Jana L. Perskie ""ceruleana""","[1, 1]","Charles Dickens' novel ""Oliver Twist,"" with its child protagonist and portrayal of criminals - their sordid lives in London's Victorian slums, and their exploitation of children, was made into a very successful musical motion picture, ""Oliver."" Slumdog Millionaire"" reminds me of a British-Bollywood version of ""Oliver."" Like ""Oliver"" it romanticizes the terrible poverty of children who are left alone to live and die by their wits. Just as ""Oliver"" had more than a few extremely dramatic moments, some difficult to watch, ""Slumdog"" follows suit. Primarily, however, both films are made to be more entertainment than social commentary.Eighteen year-old Jamal Malik, (Dev Patel), is a ""chai wallah,""  who serves tea to employees at a Bombay call center. Unbelievably, he manages to get himself on the popular game show, ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,"" as a contestant. Although literate, Jamal has no formal education. However he mysteriously manages to answer all the difficult questions put to him by the show's egocentric host, Prem Kumar, (Anil Kapoor). It seems like all of India is watching to see if the young man, originally from the slums of Darvi, will answer the final question correctly, an answer which would net him 20 million rupees. The show ends with the promise of an even greater audience and more tension the following evening, when Jamal makes his final, and hopefully winning, appearance.The film begins with a scene of a Mumbai policeman torturing Jamal. The young man is beaten, waterboarded, shocked with electricity, you name it. Superimposed on the screen is a multiple choice question with four possible answers. ""Jamal Malik is one question away from winning the jackpot. How did he do it? (A) He cheated, (B) He's lucky, (C) He's a genius, (D) It is written."" This is the same format as the ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire"" questions. Mr. Kumar reported Jamal to the police on suspicion of cheating. After all, how could a slumdog know the answers to questions which have stumped doctors, lawyers, even Ph.Ds?  Finally, after an exhaustive interrogation, the police chief believes that Jamal may be legit, and asks him to tell how he acquired his knowledge.Thus, Jamal takes the viewer on an adventure...on many, many exhilarating, terrifying adventures. For every question asked on the show, Jamal has experienced a life event which gives him the wisdom needed to respond correctly. There are frequent flashbacks to his childhood, and these flashbacks are what I most enjoyed about the film. These scenes include the vast, colorful, impoverished hell of the Darvi slums, where he and his older brother, Salim, were born and try to survive. Adorable scamps, Ayush Mahesh Khedekar, as young Jamal, and Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail, as older brother Salim, run with a crowd of children who inflict mayhem on their surroundings. Their energy is so contagious, that one focuses more on the baby hooligans' activities, mostly illegal,  than on their terrible way of life. In one instance, the camera pans out, and from high above the filthy slums look like a colorful patchwork quilt.The boys witness their mother's murder by a group of marauding, anti-Muslim hating fanatics. Left on their own, they meet another orphan in similar straights, Latika, a shy and lovely girl. (Rubina Ali plays the child, Freida Pinto the teenager). They call themselves the ""Three Musketeers."" Together they hitch a ride on a train and are thrown off in Agra India, the home of the Taj Mahal. The boys, after a few days listening to guides, improvise an improbable history of the fabulous monument, and show gullible European tourists around, earning enough money to live on.The three children are eventually discovered by a Fagin-like character, the brutal gangster Maman, (Ankur Vikal). He and his cronies tell Jamal, Salim and Latika that they run a comfortable orphanage  and convince the kids to go with them. In fact, Maman collects street children and trains them to beg for money. He cruelly has some of them blinded and crippled so they can earn more money on the streets. Salim, who is being groomed for bigger things, sees one of the children being deformed and he and Jamal escape before Jamal can be treated in a similar manner. Through an ""accident,"" as Jamal is led to believe, Latika is left behind. Jamal never forgets her. He loved her as a child and will continue to love her as a man. His obsession is to find her. It is his destiny. Salim's destiny is quite different.To avoid spoilers, I won't continue to summarize the plot. I will say that I loved the extraordinary energy of the film and the wonderfully lavish colors, of the clothing, landscapes and characters. There are so many rags to riches fairytales out there, but this one is special. The last musical number, ""Jai Ho"" is outstanding - a great song and memorable choreography! The acting, by a relatively unknown cast, is usually excellent and the pace is fast.Screenwriter, Simon Beaufoy adapted the story from the novel ""Q & A,"" (2005) by Indian author and diplomat Vikas Swarup. Beaufoy has expressed his joy at developing and introducing so many different genres and mini-tales within the overall story. Director Danny Boyle earned himself a 2008 Academy Award for Best Director and ""Slumdog Millionaire"" won for best picture.My only complaint is that the adult characters of Jamal and Latika seem flat and detached. I also think the movie could be improved upon by eliminating the romance, which I felt was a bit cliched and confused. Underdog, slumdog, Jamal is a BIG winner & that is so upbeat...but does he need to be a millionaire to finally win the girl?Jana Perskie",4,"Wonderful energy, colorful characters - a modern day

I'm sure I'd win it all.  It never happens, of course, and there ends up being questions about Zoroastrianism, famous European architecture, or Finnish lakes.  For one Indian slumdog, however, the stars align.A young man, Jamal, is a contestant on the Indian version of ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire"", and he's quickly turning into an improbable Ken Jennings-like participant with a nation of cheering .  He simply cannot lose, and none of the game-show or police officials, who torture him, believe he's doing it legitimately; they're willing to beat him in order to prove that he's cheating.  Time and time again, however, Jamal unfolds exhilarating tales of how he has answered the seemingly impossible questions, and proves through flashbacks that his difficult, poverty-stricken life filled with the pressure of both the impossible rags-to-riches life of urban Mumbai, India, but also a criminal element constantly grasping at his shoestrings, has provided him with a lot more knowledge than anyone could believe.Together with his brother Salim - who drifts towards the criminal element rather than living a more difficult ethical life - and the only woman he has ever loved, Latika, the three form as children their own version of the Three Musketeers.  When hardship causes them to separate multiple times in life, it's love that eventually brings Jamal back to his brother, and eventually Latika.  When he improbably ends up on the game-show, he realizes it is his best, and possibly last, chance at a dream life with Latika.Very rarely does a highly touted film actually deserve the praise Hollywood bestows upon it.  In the case of Slumdog Millionaire, I'd say that for a welcome change, the praise is warranted.  The story itself is enthralling; there is intense drama, excellent acting, and a total package that brings about heartbreaking emotion.  Comparable to several movies, I'd say this most closely resembles an Indian Romeo and Juliet, but with a less tragic ending.  Amidst the squalor of the Indian slums, this fast-paced gem shines right through the fast-rising garbage typical of Hollywood, as well as the garbage piling up in the Mumbai slums.

Staying with the actors for a minute, they are raw and fabulous; Frieda Pinto is beautiful and backs it up with pure talent; Dav Patel has superb range; and Madhur Mittel showed strong qualities.  I look forward to seeing each one of them in future roles.  They propelled this movie from a 1 star to 3 in my book.The screen play is pure junk...yes it had all the fancy shots, and it makes you cringe one minute and smile the next...it has all the qualities every other cookie cutter movie needs to make it in a theater today.  I tried my hardest throughout the entire movie to be fair and ignore the fact that I actually read the book that supposedly inspired this cinematic garbage.  I know with certainty that if I had seen the movie without reading the book, I would have sat there on as many occasions and said WTF!!  ""A 6 year old would really jump into an outhouse pit and run covered head to toe in human feces into a crowd of people to see his favorite actor?""  Sorry spoiler; but that's how the movie started and it didn't improve much from that point forward!There were a few moments during the movie that I recognized the bastardized version of the book.  I am especially critical about the movie because while reading the book (Q&A;) I looked forward to seeing the magical writing jump to life form on the big screen and it just didn't happen.

It's also one of the few movies released in the last months or two that is worth watching. You get enough plot info from the trailer. Slum Kid Jamal ends up on the Indian version of ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire,"" and is on his way to the 20 million rupee top prize. But how does he get his answers? The movie intertwines Jamal's present-day troubles with his back story as a dirt poor kid, his wild adventures with his streetwise brother, and his loyalty to a young girl. There are gansters and call centers and Muslim-Hindu violence and young blue child-gods -- a fantastic blend of Indian of the past and present spiced with danger and love. Also phenomenal music -- one of the few movie soundtracks I wouldn't mind picking up. It's blend of atmospheric tunes and pulsing beats anchors the movie's intense action. The acting by the entire ensemble is first rate. The three leads are played at different ages by three actors, some of the best child actors I have ever seen on screen. Watching ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is a great way to spend 2 hours on a cold, wintry Sunday afternoon. Wild, action-packed, dramatic and moving.

1226202,A1RSXP7MB772E3,B001P9KR8U,"Jeff W. Shimkus ""Movie Manji""","[1, 3]","Slumdog Millionaire is directed by Danny Boyle and he has a unique style to making a movie and how it leaves a viewer. If you don't know already, I really am a huge fan of his. He makes awesome movies, and he usually pushes genres furthur with new techniques and improvements. Such as being one of the first to film entirely with handheld digitals in the brilliant, and redefining, zombie film: ""28 days later."" He did this even though the medium was panned by some directors as being inferior to film, yet he found some use to its grainy quality and it helped produce the gritty, concrete feel to that marvelous classic. He has a great cinematic eye for the speed of sequences and film editing process, and he always has very good, interesting, new-age music, usually done by the magnificent Murphy.And again, in Slumdog Millionaire Danny Boyle proves how emmaculate a director he truely is by using a large cast of unknown actors and actresses. For most Americans, there is absolutely no recognizable stars used. I'm sure there is a successful Indian star that I'm not giving proper credit to and sorry for that. And yet it works here in the states because the cast is natural and excellent; big complement considering the age range of the entire cast (k-adult).This movie is uncompromising in its representation of India's Mega-slums and the transformation of the slums later is epic. This is a must see for not just the Director fans and Love stories but fans of great movie making. You travel from epic land fills to the rising skyscapers that are the sign of the developing future of Indian. You get a sense of the maturation of not only the children as time passes by of the country India, as if she were the grandest character of all. This movie is a successful romance film about the coming of age of children that even people of a different culture can identify with. I love Danny Boyles bold movie making decisions, and feel that he is one of the few pioneering directors with emmense talent helping who is helping to spread culturalism to households that may not have had the opportunity otherwise.",5,"One of the Best movies of 2008, not just Bollywood.",1231200000,"01 6, 2009",2009,2110,"['Slumdog', 'Millionaire', 'directed', 'Danny', 'Boyle', 'unique', 'style', 'making', 'movie', 'how', 'viewer', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'already', 'really', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'awesome', 'movies', 'usually', 'genres', 'furthur', 'new', 'techniques', 'improvements', 'Such', 'being', 'one', 'first', 'film', 'entirely', 'handheld', 'digitals', 'brilliant', 'redefining', 'zombie', 'film', '28', 'days', 'later', 'did', 'even', 'medium', 'was', 'panned', 'directors', 'being', 'inferior', 'film', 'found', 'use', 'grainy', 'quality', 'helped', 'produce', 'gritty', 'concrete', 'feel', 'marvelous', 'classic', 'great', 'cinematic', 'eye', 'speed', 'sequences', 'film', 'editing', 'process', 'always', 'very', 'good', 'interesting', 'new-age', 'music', 'usually', 'done', 'magnificent', 'Murphy.And', 'again', 'Slumdog', 'Millionaire', 'Danny', 'Boyle', 'how', 'emmaculate', 'director', 'truely', 'using', 'large', 'cast', 'unknown', 'actors', 'actresses', 'most', 'Americans', 'absolutely', 'recognizable', 'stars', 'used', ""'m"", 'sure', 'successful', 'Indian', 'star', ""'m"", 'not', 'giving', 'proper', 'credit', 'sorry', 'yet', 'here', 'states', 'cast', 'natural', 'excellent', 'big', 'complement', 'considering', 'age', 'range', 'entire', 'cast', 'k-adult', '.This', 'movie', 'uncompromising', 'representation', 'India', 'Mega-slums', 'transformation', 'slums', 'later', 'epic', 'must', 'see', 'not', 'just', 'Director', 'fans', 'Love', 'stories', 'fans', 'great', 'movie', 'making', 'travel', 'epic', 'land', 'fills', 'rising', 'skyscapers', 'are', 'sign', 'developing', 'future', 'Indian', 'get', 'sense', 'maturation', 'not', 'only', 'children', 'time', 'passes', 'country', 'India', 'were', 'grandest', 'character', 'movie', 'successful', 'romance', 'film', 'coming', 'age', 'children', 'even', 'people', 'different', 'culture', 'can', 'identify', 'love', 'Danny', 'Boyles', 'bold', 'movie', 'making', 'decisions', 'feel', 'one', 'few', 'pioneering', 'directors', 'emmense', 'talent', 'helping', 'who', 'helping', 'spread', 'culturalism', 'households', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'had', 'opportunity', 'otherwise']",N/A

The viewer is not spared the very apparent misery of those slums and the legions of poor who pick through the garbage, the beggars the very lowest on the social ladder.The tale is of Jamal, Salim and a girl, Latika, who becomes attached to them under horrible circumstances as very young children. Taken under the wing of a villain lifted directly from Dickens, but who is probably all too real in such poverty, the children are groomed for lives as beggars and prostitutes.Fate conspires to separate Jamal and Salim from Latika. The boys go off on their not-very-honest adventures across India. A few years later - with the kids being played by different actors now to reflect their emergence into adolescence - Jamal returns to Bombay to search for Latika, a rather daunting task in a city of 19 million, but as a product of the slums, he knows where to look.The story takes darker and darker turns with the would-be lovers separated again and again.Finally, in an unlikely set of coincidences, Jamal winds up as a winning contestant on ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire"" and as a victim of police torture.There are more twists and turns to this story than you can count, but the literate viewer will be able to identify all the plot devices lifted from classics and name their authors. Dickens and Dumas are prominent as is Shakespeare and numerous others. In short, this is a brilliant concept for a love story, turned into a compelling script and then an irresistible movie. It is a classic love story as well as poor-boy-makes-good. Some might be put off by the brutal depiction of Indian poverty, violence and generally depressing lives of many shown in this film.Jerry",5,Interesting story of love and emergence from the slums of Bombay,1252540800,"09 10, 2009",2009,1845,"['like', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'lesser', 'extent', 'Horatio', 'Alger', ""'ll"", 'love', 'movie.Jamal', 'older', 'brother', 'Salim', 'are', 'children', 'Bombay', 'now', 'Mumbai', 'slums', 'viewer', 'not', 'spared', 'very', 'apparent', 'misery', 'slums', 'legions', 'poor', 'who', 'pick', 'garbage', 'beggars', 'very', 'lowest', 'social', 'ladder.The', 'tale', 'Jamal', 'Salim', 'girl', 'Latika', 'who', 'attached', 'horrible', 'circumstances', 'very', 'young', 'children', 'Taken', 'wing', 'villain', 'lifted', 'directly', 'Dickens', 'who', 'probably', 'too', 'real', 'such', 'poverty', 'children', 'are', 'groomed', 'lives', 'beggars', 'prostitutes.Fate', 'conspires', 'separate', 'Jamal', 'Salim', 'Latika', 'boys', 'go', 'off', 'not-very-honest', 'adventures', 'India', 'A', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'kids', 'being', 'played', 'different', 'actors', 'now', 'reflect', 'emergence', 'adolescence', 'Jamal', 'returns', 'Bombay', 'search', 'Latika', 'rather', 'daunting', 'task', 'city', '19', 'million', 'product', 'slums', 'where', 'look.The', 'story', 'darker', 'darker', 'would-be', 'lovers', 'separated', 'again', 'again.Finally', 'unlikely', 'set', 'coincidences', 'Jamal', 'up', 'winning', 'contestant', 'Who', 'Be', 'Millionaire', 'victim', 'police', 'are', 'more', 'twists', 'story', 'can', 'count', 'literate', 'viewer', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'identify', 'plot', 'devices', 'lifted', 'classics', 'name', 'authors', 'Dickens', 'Dumas', 'are', 'prominent', 'Shakespeare', 'numerous', 'others', 'short', 'brilliant', 'concept', 'love', 'story', 'turned', 'compelling', 'script', 'then', 'irresistible', 'movie', 'classic', 'love', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'poor-boy-makes-good', 'might', 'be', 'put', 'off', 'brutal', 'depiction', 'Indian', 'poverty', 'violence', 'generally', 'depressing', 'lives', 'many', 'shown', 'film.Jerry']",N/A

Maybe I saw a different film than the majority of the reviewers here, but I was amazed after viewing this film that it was so heavily lauded.  I found it to be no different than hundreds of other formulaic films that are overly violent and graphic throughout with a nice wrap-it-all-up Hollywood ending where the guy and the girl kiss and then the film is over.  The only difference with this film is that it takes place in India and focuses on Indian culture.  I was willing to stomach the graphic violence and torture scenes at first under the mistaken impression that this film was based on a true story.  After learning that the story is fictional, I was appalled that people would find inspiring a story about a kid who suffers unimaginable mistreatment and torture throughout his life only to be redeemed by winning a bunch of money on a game show by answering questions that he ""learned"" the answers to through his life experiences.  Yeah right!  Not only would that never happen in real life, it isn't as though the money he wins or the fact that he gets the girl at the end are going to undo all of the horrible things that happened to him and his brother throughout the film and ""make it all okay.""  Fans of this film like to say that the violence and torture scenes are realistic depictions of life in the slums of India.  While this may very well be true, I don't find it entertaining and I go to the movies to be entertained first and educated second.  If I wanted to see that kind of stuff, I have no problem with watching it in a documentary.  I feel that the filmmakers overdid it on the violence in such a way that more screen time is given to the violent scenes than is given to the supposed ""inspirational"" ones.

It got such rave reviews and awards at the Oscars I figured this had to be a fabulous film by far.  To my surprise the film was rather violent and showed abuse and exploitation of children.  I guess this was a touch of realism of the happenings in poor villages.  Anyhow, the story is a bit depressinig and sad, however, the only uplifting part is Jamal's undying love for Letita whom he knew briefly as a little boy, got separated from, and despreately sought to find throughout the rest of the movie.  The story has many holes in it and leaves you wondering what happened here and there.  I thought the flashbacks to how Jamal came to know the answers to some of the questions on the game show was a pretty creative idea.  I never understood why they thought he was cheating or how they could legally get away with torturing him for such an accusation.  The most a game show would do if you cheated is to take back the winnings!!  Not shock you with electrical currents and hang you from a wall!!  That part made no sense.  He was sitting in the hosts face the whole time...how could he cheat??  I just wish the love story was built up more since a good portion of the film showed Jamal searching for this girl.  Also, I wish they would have shown what he did once he won all that money.  Again, the film was good but I don't see what the massive hype was about.

Rooney,"[0, 1]","""Slumdog Millionaire"" is an entirely neoteric movie, extremely suspenseful with fantastic views of Mumbai especially film of one of the world's largest slums. The Taj Mahal hotel and Victoria Station are featured as are many other aspects of this vibrant city. I visited Mumbai(formerly Bombay)and can attest to the frantic, frenetic rhythm and energy of the city you see in the movie.Three or four levels of suspense are going on simultaneously in this story which will mesmerize you. The life of the poverty-stricken boy-protagonist who is a contestant on a millionaire game show with its huge stakes, the police interrogation, the missing girl, the hardships and manipulation of slum life--all cry out for your attention. It's a multi-layered, very intense movie. The acting is topnotch. Everything about the movie is done with meticulous care. I think it'd destined to be a classic.It's fascinating to realize how the moviemakers get you drawn into the movie. But stay for the credits because they are in the old Bollywood musical extravaganza tradition. They put you into another world and are sensational.There are excruciatingly exciting chases, gangsters, extreme poverty, humor, and always the slums and the slum mentality. The survival wiliness of the two brothers as they grow up is fascinating to watch. The three musketeers is a theme that gallops through the movie. It's triumph and tragedy. The protagonist becomes a chai wallah, a delivery boy of chai, spice milk tea.The editing is done so superbly you cannot take your eyes off the screen full of vivid imagery and non-stop action. It's a portrait of a city and a boy on their headlong dash toward destiny with ferocity and velocity. India is a place where one in a million can hit it big, but for most people can barely survive in one of the world's countries with the highest rate of poverty and intractable slums.

Sure, it was a great effort; the photography was great, the music was also great, and the acting for the most part was good, but there were a few things that really turned me off when it came to Slumdog Millionaire. One of them being how the film presented itself in the form of a Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? question and ended with the painfully predictable answer. This was just a way too pretentious and just flat out silly way to start a movie.  I also felt the hackneyed back-and-forth storytelling between Jamal being accused of cheating and the story of his life and how he came to know the answers was trite and very formulaic, especially for a Danny Boyle movie. Also, even though I did like the ending to the movie, it was the exact ending I saw coming within the first 10 minutes of the movie. There were literally no surprises in Slumdog. Just a rather stale connect-the-dots movie. I also felt the dance number at the end credits was horribly out of place and I had to remind myself that I didn't just watch a Step Up sequel, but a Danny Boyle film.

The movie owes much of its success to the small children who play Jamal and his brother in flashbacks; they're wonderfully talented and believable in quite challenging roles.

This is how the story goes: The story of Jamal Malik, an 18 year-old orphan from the slums of Mumbai, who is about to experience the biggest day of his life. With the whole nation watching, he is just one question away from winning a staggering 20 million rupees on India's ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?"" But when the show breaks for the night, police arrest him on suspicion of cheating; how could a street kid know so much? Desperate to prove his innocence, Jamal tells the story of his life in the slum where he and his brother grew up, of their adventures together on the road, of vicious encounters with local gangs, and of Latika, the girl he loved and lost. Each chapter of his story reveals the key to the answer to one of the game show's questions. Intrigued by Jamal's story, the jaded Police Inspector begins to wonder what a young man with no apparent desire for riches is really doing on this game show? When the new day dawns and Jamal returns to answer the final question, the Inspector and sixty million viewers are about to find out...The cast led by Dev Patel (as Jamal) & Freida Pinto (as Latika) is excellent!

It's that kind of tale:  Unlikely underdog rises from despair due to pluck, perseverance and highly improbable coincidence.  And yet it works.Make no bones; it's a dark-toned film in the early going, especially the first half hour or so.  You will see the kind of gut-wrenching, cruel beyond belief poverty and exploitation that will make you want to turn away.

I can understand how some viewers don't want to see the ugly reality of this young man's world, but I would also counter that we can't pretend it's not the way life is for some.But that being said, if you will give the film the time it needs to tell this story, I think you might be sucked into Jamal's narrative, just as I was.  You might come to admire his resolve; his single-mindedness and the idea that he believes in the future -- not that he will be rich, mind you -- but that he will find the girl who is his destiny despite all of the things that keep pulling them apart.  Ultimately, his motivation is not the money, but doing right by the girl who was left behind.  As the layers unfold of how Jamal came to knows what he knows, I became as intrigued as the police captain who is interrogating him.But beyond the love story, there's the equally compelling relationship of the two brothers.  Jamal's brother Salim alternately exploits, protects, and betrays him throughout the film as the story spans through their childhood, teenage, and young adult years.

It's an emotional roller coaster ride that left me exhilarated and convinced that this breakthrough film is a true global masterpiece.The film opens as a young Indian man competes on a television quiz show.  He is winning and winning. In the next scene he is being tortured by the police because they think he is cheating as he is not educated and is a child of the slums.  His story is then told in flashbacks, as the audience learns how he came to know the answers to each of the questions.We meet him and his brother as young children living on the street and exploited by gangsters to become street beggars.  However, there is constant humor in juxtaposition to the wince-inducing revulsion which adds a special kind of humanity to the story.  Through all the misfortunes to which the brothers are exposed, there is an upbeat quality to the film, as we come to understand that it was these traumatic incidents in this young man's life that taught him the specific answers to the question being asked on the quiz show.Of course there is also a romance.  Our hero is looking for the young woman he loves, a childhood companion through the horror, who is still being exploited by the Indian underworld, which now includes his brother.All of this is packed in an upbeat and moving story that involved me from the beginning and made me want to stand up and cheer at the happy ending.This is not a film to be missed.

I was wrong. Slumdog Millionaire is a very well done movie and deserved the Oscar for best picture and cinematography. Throughout the movie you are never really sure whether he is going to get the girl or the money. Both are certainly worth having.Be aware that this movie is rated R for a reason. The main character is tortured by the police, his mother is killed during a violent rampage against Muslims, his brother becomes an assassin at an early age, and a ruthless organized crime gang intentionally blinds a young boy.Slumdog is much more edgy than old school Bollywood films like Asoka or Lagaan.

Appearing on the popular quiz show, he somehow knows the answers.  The narcissistic tv host mocks him as a  'chai wallah,'  (tea boy) yet Jamal remains unfazed.Suddenly, we see the police torturing this slightly built young man to admit he cheated and forfeit the opportunity for the big prize.  The realisation dawns that Jamal is tougher than he seems, and so the story begins.It's not about the money, and it's not about the quiz show.  It's more about how character is forged not by adversity, but how you respond to it.As he tells his story the police officer gets caught up in it. ""What happened to the girl?,"" he asks, the same question we're asking.It's a twin story showing the contrast, between the two brothers, who both have similar experiences.  Both make entirely different decisions that lead them down two certain but separate paths.  These conflicts drive the narrative at rocket like speed.  Latika, the orphan girl, is the damsel in distress, the subject of desire and conflict.In fact life is harder for Jamal, because of a certain someone, one of a series of antagonists, as you will see, yet Jamal remains resilient, resourceful, and has a capacity for love and even forgiveness, that is indeed inspiring.Slumdog has already won numerous film awards, particularly for Danny Boyle, who previously directed Shallow Grave, and Trainspotting.  It's also been nominated for 4 Golden Globes for Best Director, Motion Picture, Score and Screenplay. It does deserve Academy Awards for Best Picture, Direction, and Screenplay.

1226252,A36EW68H08UOCS,B001P9KR8U,"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[123, 147]","Slumdog Millionaire deserves a place among the masterpieces of world cinema.  Praise is pouring in for this brilliant film, directed by Danny Boyle from a screenplay by Simon Beaufoy adapted from a novel by Vikas Swarup.The settings move from the bleakest - the slums outside Mumbai, where our hero, Jamal Malik, lives as a child with his older brother Salim - to high rise vistas and no less than the Taj Mahal.  The story ranges from the worst despair and heartbreak to the noblest sacrifice and most romantic love.We are introduced in the opening moments to the young adult Jamal, played by Dev Patel.  He is a contestant on the Indian version of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire and has just answered the ten million rupee question prior to the end of the show.  His next question will be worth twenty million rupees, an unimaginable fortune to the average Indian.  The arrogant, primping star of the show, played with artificial charm concealing an oily narcissism by Anil Kapoor, cannot stand that young Jamal is stealing some of his spotlight, and believes that the young, uneducated ""slumdog"" is cheating.  (One of the key sequences involves the host ""proving"" to himself that Jamal MUST be cheating.) Jamal has been handed over to the police, who torture him to make him confess his deception.  This moment in Jamal's life frames the rest of the film, told in flashback, and explains the torturous road that allowed Jamal to answer even the most difficult questions.We are not told about Jamal and Salim's father, but in an early sequence we see their mother murdered in a brutal religion riot as club-wielding Hindu's attack a Muslim slum.  Orphaned, Jamal and Salim live in the trash dump at the edge of the slum.  They befriend another orphan, the young girl Latika.The remainder of the film fills in the gaps of the lives of Jamal and Salim and Latika, who call themselves the Three Musketeers, but only got far enough in school before the murder of their mother to learn the names Athos and Porthos.  Along the way they encounter police brutality, orphanage directors who make Fagin and Bill Sykes look like Mother Teresa, as well as Indian gangsters and other people-traffickers.  Several sequences show us that Salim is becoming hardened by their harsh life, although he retains a degree of love for Jamal.  For his part Jamal makes the most of what life gives him. He only resorts to the criminal activities Salim sees as the only way to make it out of necessity.  At two different times Jamal is heart-breakingly separated from Latika, and at one level the entire film is a love story about Jamal's single-minded dedication to reunite with the only girl he ever loved. (Nine astonishing performances are given of the ""Three Musketeers"" at three different ages of life, and it is appropriate to give credit to Ayush Mahesh Khedekar, Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail and Rubiana Ali as the youngest Jamal, Salim and Latika as well as Tanay Chheda, Ashutosh Lobo Gajiwala and Tanvi Ganesh Lonkar as the just-past-puberty versions.  Dev Patel and the beautiful Freida Pinto may become international sensations as the adult star-crossed lovers.  Madhur Mittal has less screen time as the adult Salim, but his character plays an important role.)The faint-hearted should know that the language could appear on American television and that there is no nudity, but the violence, in particular two torture scenes, are flinch-inducing.Slumdog is a piece of fiction - a fantasy - but it includes real emotions and believable human characters.  I walked from the theater feeling a little better about being alive, and knowing that I had just viewed a stunning artistic achievement.One of the inequities of the movie business is that a film like this can only open in a few theaters in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, and take weeks to arrive at ""lesser"" destinations like Atlanta and Houston and St. Louis, while Beverly Hills Chihuahua opened nationwide on thousands of screens.

And this goes back further than the pinnacle of this genre, ROCKY. So what did the voters of the Academy do this year when it came to an Oscar winner for best film? They picked SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE.This movie features the most improved character when it comes to tough times. The major plot of the film is actually quite simple. A young man goes on TV in India for a WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIR show. His goal is to make enough to find the girl of his dreams and settle down with her. That's it. And yet, that's not all there is to it.The film uses a combination of present day situations combined with well executed flashbacks to show just how fortunate he is on the show. Each and every question asked of him is something he has learned through the rough and tumble times of his life. And troubled times they were.As the film opens our hero, Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) is being interrogated by the police. His suspected crime is cheating on the game show he is winning. How could someone of his background, a dweller from the poorest community in Mumbai (thus the Slumdog portion of the title), possible know the answers to these questions? As he is questioned, he provides the police chief as well as the viewers of the story of his life and how he came to know them.As a small child Jamal and his brother Salim play amid fields of garbage while living with their mother. A riot involving the Muslim and non-Muslim factions leads to their mother's murder and their quickly becoming orphans. Along with a young girl they meet named Latika, they live off the street until they are rescued by a missionary who collects young orphans.But this is no real missionary as it turns out he uses the small children to scam people on the street into giving them money. He collects it all. He even goes so far as to blind those that can sing so they will make more money. With a little luck, Salim, Jamal and Latika escape, only to have Latika captured before they can get away.Jamal is infatuated with Latika and his search for her spurs the romantic side of the story. He and his brother search for her until the day she is found. But this leads to more tragedy as Salim gets a gun and becomes a young gangster involved with crooks in town. A break between brothers results in Latika and Jamal parting ways once more.More and more happens to Jamal and each experience shows his determination to find a better life as well as Latika. And while Jamal works hard, attempting to rise above his circumstances, Salim dives into the worst the world has to offer, making a living for himself but at what cost?The end result is Jamal's appearance on the game show where he has the chance to make more than he could have ever dreamed of. And with the money he has the chance to rescue Latika from the fate that befell her not only at the hands of Salim but of the local gangster head who has chosen her for his own.There are more scenes and difficulties than I've listed here, but better to see them for yourself. And the best part of this film was the slow unspooling of the tale, as Jamal recounts his life and how each part of it provided the answers he needed to win, The world through his eyes is one of hope, the eyes of Salim a despair. How two brothers can see the world differently makes up a major portion of the tale.All of the acting in the film is impressive not only for the professionals but for the children who play them in their youth as well. Chosen to play these parts were actual children from the area, the real slumdog children. Dev Patel as the adult Jamal has a future ahead of him granted he gets parts as good as this one.So was this the best film that came out last year? Good enough that it deserved the Oscar for best film? Yes, it is an exceptional film. But I can think of others I enjoyed more. Then again I've rarely agreed with what the Academy chooses over the past few years. But if you enjoy good storytelling, then you'll want to make a point of watching this film.

From ""Trainspotting"" to ""Millions"". From ""28 Days Later"" to ""Slumdog Millionaire"". The only thing any of these movies have in common is they're extraordinary works of filmmaking that both critics and consumers seem to love. And you won't find a blockbuster among them, and you probably never will from Mr. Boyle. But the lack of box office recognition will probably be the last thing on Boyle's mind come award season when ""Slumdog Millionaire"" predictably becomes an Academy Award sleeper. Is it that good? You betcha!The style, the substance, the tone, the story all scream wow! And all defy description. It's a heart wrenching, gut wrenching, heart tugging, heart warming, soul searching, spirit lifting, epic drama that is as much romantic as it is harrowing, as suspenseful as it is funny.Slumdog is the name attached to orphans that grow up in the human cesspool of Mumbai India that somehow manage to survive much like poly wags would in stagnant pools of waste back here in America. Against all odds. Miracle against miracle, this slumdog grows into a smart, streetwise young man, who makes it onto India's version of ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?"" And...well, without spoiling the film, all I'll say is ""he doesn't."" ""Want to be a millionaire, that is.""Smart, intuitive, unpredictable and refreshing. With a Hollywood ending that's only succeeded by it's Bollywood ending. Is this one of my favorite movies of the year?

If you care about the ending, read no further***When the idea of going to view this film was first presented I have to admit I had little inkling of the implications of the term `slumdog' nor did I have prior knowledge of the film's premise. For all I knew it could have been a documentary regarding the luxurious life of Leona Helmsley's pampered pooch. Once the term was explained to me, the denouement couldn't have been any more obvious and in many respects, impressed me only as a relatively creative interpretation of an age old story.`Slumdog' is at its' core a classical love story encapsulated in an ""Algerian"" style - Horatio the author rather than the North African inspired bric a brac of Pier One  - modern fairy tale intentionally constructed to bring a swell to the tear ducts of any compassionate being. It's an invigorated modernization of Oliver Twist where the trenchantly inspirational yet deterministically encumbered hero will not permit any barrier to obstruct his sojourn to reunification with the love of his life.Director Danny Boyle did a commendable job with his overwhelmingly young and relatively inexperienced cast. The leads Dev Patel, in the role of Jamal Malik and Freida Pinto, as Latika, were often equally competent and  enthralling in their roles as the star-challenged if not crossed, sweethearts. Patel had some prior acting experience while Pinto's background included a great deal of modeling and a presence that guarantees she will be heard from in the future. By utilization of the backdrop of participation on the Indian version of the game show, `Who wants to be a Millionaire' the director was able to flow near seamlessly from the present to a variety of past settings and scenarios to bring the harsh lives of the characters, most noticeably Jamal but by extrapolation all of the marginalized children of the urban morass, into focus and at the same time provide a view of western ambivalence to intra-cultural subjugation. Significantly, the strata of the game served as an interesting dichotomy with the travails of the main character. As the questions he had to master became increasingly difficult, so it appeared were the obstacles he had been forced to overcome at each segment of his life recollections.Films with predominately uplifting, cathartic conclusions, most especially those fortunate enough to enjoy wide exposure during eras as universally challenging as we presently endure,  generally will be received as spiritually restorative. While `Slumdog' is a pleasant, largely non-offensive offering, I am not certain it would garner the same extraordinary level of accolades if it had first appeared during a more prosperous epoch.  While the regions may differ, in its' essence I didn't find this movie substantially  dissimilar in underlying message to the Brazilian filmCity of Godand the South African film,Tsotsi.",3,Plentitudes and Placebos,1234656000,"02 15, 2009",2009,2908,"['***Inductive', 'Spoiler', 'Alert', 'care', 'ending', 'read', 'further***When', 'idea', 'going', 'view', 'film', 'was', 'first', 'presented', 'have', 'admit', 'had', 'little', 'inkling', 'implications', 'term', 'slumdog', 'did', 'have', 'prior', 'knowledge', 'film', 'premise', 'knew', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'documentary', 'regarding', 'luxurious', 'life', 'Leona', 'Helmsley', 'pampered', 'pooch', 'term', 'was', 'explained', 'denouement', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'more', 'obvious', 'many', 'respects', 'impressed', 'only', 'relatively', 'creative', 'interpretation', 'age', 'old', 'story.', 'Slumdog', 'core', 'classical', 'love', 'story', 'encapsulated', 'Algerian', 'style', 'author', 'rather', 'North', 'African', 'inspired', 'bric', 'brac', 'Pier', 'One', 'modern', 'fairy', 'tale', 'intentionally', 'constructed', 'bring', 'swell', 'tear', 'ducts', 'compassionate', 'being', 'invigorated', 'modernization', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'where', 'trenchantly', 'inspirational', 'yet', 'deterministically', 'encumbered', 'hero', 'will', 'not', 'permit', 'barrier', 'obstruct', 'sojourn', 'reunification', 'love', 'life.Director', 'Danny', 'Boyle', 'did', 'commendable', 'job', 'overwhelmingly', 'young', 'relatively', 'inexperienced', 'cast', 'leads', 'Dev', 'Patel', 'role', 'Jamal', 'Malik', 'Freida', 'Pinto', 'Latika', 'were', 'often', 'equally', 'competent', 'enthralling', 'roles', 'star-challenged', 'not', 'crossed', 'sweethearts', 'Patel', 'had', 'prior', 'acting', 'experience', 'Pinto', 'background', 'included', 'great', 'deal', 'modeling', 'presence', 'will', 'be', 'heard', 'future', 'utilization', 'backdrop', 'participation', 'Indian', 'version', 'game', 'show', 'Who', 'be', 'Millionaire', 'director', 'was', 'able', 'flow', 'near', 'seamlessly', 'present', 'variety', 'past', 'settings', 'scenarios', 'bring', 'harsh', 'lives', 'characters', 'most', 'noticeably', 'Jamal', 'extrapolation', 'marginalized', 'children', 'urban', 'morass', 'focus', 'same', 'time', 'provide', 'view', 'western', 'ambivalence', 'intra-cultural', 'subjugation', 'Significantly', 'strata', 'game', 'served', 'interesting', 'dichotomy', 'travails', 'main', 'character', 'questions', 'had', 'master', 'became', 'increasingly', 'difficult', 'appeared', 'were', 'obstacles', 'had', 'been', 'forced', 'overcome', 'segment', 'life', 'recollections.Films', 'predominately', 'uplifting', 'cathartic', 'conclusions', 'most', 'especially', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'enjoy', 'wide', 'exposure', 'eras', 'universally', 'challenging', 'presently', 'endure', 'generally', 'will', 'be', 'received', 'spiritually', 'restorative', 'Slumdog', 'pleasant', 'largely', 'non-offensive', 'offering', 'am', 'not', 'certain', 'would', 'garner', 'same', 'extraordinary', 'level', 'accolades', 'had', 'first', 'appeared', 'more', 'prosperous', 'epoch', 'regions', 'may', 'differ', 'essence', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'movie', 'substantially', 'dissimilar', 'underlying', 'message', 'Brazilian', 'filmCity', 'Godand', 'South', 'African', 'film', 'Tsotsi']",N/A
1226257,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B001P9KR8U,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[2, 4]","Slumdog Millionaire brings to life a most unusual but plausible story of a young man who had to raise himself with his brother on the streets of Mumbai and deal with his affection and ever increasing love for a young woman who seems to be pitifully elusive. In addition, he must fight against the thugs and street gangs, one of which his brother eventually joins for excitement and money. Yes, on the surface it's about a young man who is so good at the Indian TV version of ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire"" that the police torture him to make him reveal ""his way of cheating"" on the quiz show. However, this film goes so much deeper; we see his life in a series of flashbacks as he explains to the police just how he was actually able to know all the answers to the questions on the quiz show. In addition, the cinematography and the choreography lack nothing; I couldn't ask for better. The casting was wonderfully done with great care and the acting is extremely convincing--wow, what a group of actors they had in this movie! The musical score enhances the movie as well.When the action starts, we meet two young boys who are brothers, the very young Salim (Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail) and Jamal (Ayush Mahesh Khedekar). After they witness their mother being brutally killed by an angry mob, the two young boys are defenseless and they toughen up pretty quickly to adapt to being on their own, although Salim seems to do a little bit better at it. Salim is not afraid of much and he even sells his brother's prized celebrity autograph merely because he wants the money for himself; when Jamal is upset about it Salim just smiles and says he got good money for it and so that makes it right. Already we are seeing Salim going to the wrong side of the tracks. Salim and Jamal also meet another orphaned child, Latika (Rubina Ali) and Jamal takes a liking to Latika almost immediately, he even feels that with a third kid they can be just like ""The Three Musketeers!""As time goes by we see the boys grow and develop; but Latika is sadly left behind when the boys climb aboard a moving train to escape the evil operator of an ""orphanage"" who likes to maim the youngsters who he forces to beg for money in the streets. Jamal misses Latika very, very badly but Salim just makes light of it; Jamal however is determined to find Latika and ultimately make her his own no matter low long his search for her takes. Eventually they do find Latika but Salim and Latika mysteriously spurn Jamal; and then it takes Jamal several years more to find Latika again. As adults, we see the grown Jamal (Dev Patel), Salim (Madhur Mittal) and Latika (Freida Pinto) coping with life and trying to work on relationships as best they can under horrible circumstances that I will not reveal here; I don't want to give you any spoilers. Of course, what you do know is that Jamal makes it onto the quiz show and he is well on his way to winning a lot of money; he even gets around the game show host Prem Kumar (Anil Kapoor) who tries to throw Jamal off with a phony tip on the answer to the next question on the quiz show.The rest is left for you to discover; but I shall say you won't be bored. This is an excellent, poignant film that will leave you with quite a lasting impression. The extras on the DVD are quite well done, too. I especially liked the featurette entitled ""Slumdog Dreams: Danny Boyle & The Making of Slumdog Millionaire."" There are optional audio commentaries by director Danny Boyle and Dev Patel and producer Christian Colson and writer Simon Beaufoy. We get deleted scenes, too.Slumdog Millionaire makes a great addition to your DVD collection; it did win eight Academy Awards including the Oscar for Best Picture and that alone proves this movie is very, very special. There is a modicum of violence so if you're turned off by that you may wish to reconsider; but the way this plays out is so artistic that you might just want to get this and enjoy it anyway.",5,"20,000,000 Rupees wasn't the prize...",1250121600,"08 13, 2009",2009,3960,"['Slumdog', 'Millionaire', 'life', 'most', 'unusual', 'plausible', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'raise', 'brother', 'streets', 'Mumbai', 'deal', 'affection', 'ever', 'increasing', 'love', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'be', 'pitifully', 'elusive', 'addition', 'must', 'fight', 'thugs', 'street', 'gangs', 'one', 'brother', 'eventually', 'excitement', 'money', 'Yes', 'surface', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'so', 'good', 'Indian', 'TV', 'version', 'Who', 'Be', 'Millionaire', 'police', 'torture', 'make', 'reveal', 'way', 'cheating', 'quiz', 'show', 'However', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'deeper', 'see', 'life', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'police', 'just', 'how', 'was', 'actually', 'able', 'know', 'answers', 'questions', 'quiz', 'show', 'addition', 'cinematography', 'choreography', 'lack', 'nothing', 'could', ""n't"", 'ask', 'better', 'casting', 'was', 'wonderfully', 'done', 'great', 'care', 'acting', 'extremely', 'convincing', 'wow', 'what', 'group', 'actors', 'had', 'movie', 'musical', 'score', 'movie', 'well.When', 'action', 'meet', 'two', 'young', 'boys', 'who', 'are', 'brothers', 'very', 'young', 'Salim', 'Azharuddin', 'Mohammed', 'Ismail', 'Jamal', 'Ayush', 'Mahesh', 'Khedekar', 'witness', 'mother', 'being', 'brutally', 'killed', 'angry', 'mob', 'two', 'young', 'boys', 'are', 'defenseless', 'toughen', 'up', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'adapt', 'being', 'own', 'Salim', 'do', 'little', 'bit', 'better', 'Salim', 'not', 'afraid', 'much', 'even', 'brother', 'prized', 'celebrity', 'autograph', 'merely', 'money', 'when', 'Jamal', 'upset', 'Salim', 'just', 'smiles', 'got', 'good', 'money', 'so', 'right', 'are', 'seeing', 'Salim', 'going', 'wrong', 'side', 'tracks', 'Salim', 'Jamal', 'also', 'orphaned', 'child', 'Latika', 'Rubina', 'Ali', 'Jamal', 'liking', 'Latika', 'almost', 'immediately', 'even', 'third', 'kid', 'can', 'be', 'just', 'Three', 'Musketeers', 'time', 'see', 'boys', 'grow', 'develop', 'Latika', 'sadly', 'left', 'behind', 'when', 'boys', 'climb', 'moving', 'train', 'escape', 'evil', 'operator', 'orphanage', 'who', 'maim', 'youngsters', 'who', 'beg', 'money', 'streets', 'Jamal', 'misses', 'Latika', 'very', 'very', 'badly', 'Salim', 'just', 'light', 'Jamal', 'however', 'determined', 'find', 'Latika', 'ultimately', 'make', 'own', 'matter', 'low', 'long', 'search', 'Eventually', 'do', 'find', 'Latika', 'Salim', 'Latika', 'mysteriously', 'spurn', 'Jamal', 'then', 'Jamal', 'several', 'years', 'more', 'find', 'Latika', 'again', 'adults', 'see', 'grown', 'Jamal', 'Dev', 'Patel', 'Salim', 'Madhur', 'Mittal', 'Latika', 'Freida', 'Pinto', 'coping', 'life', 'trying', 'work', 'relationships', 'can', 'horrible', 'circumstances', 'will', 'not', 'reveal', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'spoilers', 'course', 'what', 'do', 'know', 'Jamal', 'quiz', 'show', 'well', 'way', 'winning', 'lot', 'money', 'even', 'game', 'show', 'host', 'Prem', 'Kumar', 'Anil', 'Kapoor', 'who', 'throw', 'Jamal', 'off', 'phony', 'tip', 'answer', 'next', 'question', 'quiz', 'show.The', 'rest', 'left', 'discover', 'shall', 'say', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'bored', 'excellent', 'poignant', 'film', 'will', 'leave', 'lasting', 'impression', 'extras', 'DVD', 'are', 'quite', 'well', 'done', 'too', 'especially', 'liked', 'featurette', 'entitled', 'Slumdog', 'Dreams', 'Danny', 'Boyle', 'Making', 'Slumdog', 'Millionaire', 'are', 'optional', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'director', 'Danny', 'Boyle', 'Dev', 'Patel', 'producer', 'Christian', 'Colson', 'writer', 'Simon', 'Beaufoy', 'get', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'too.Slumdog', 'Millionaire', 'great', 'addition', 'DVD', 'collection', 'did', 'win', 'eight', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'including', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Picture', 'alone', 'movie', 'very', 'very', 'special', 'modicum', 'violence', 'so', ""'re"", 'turned', 'off', 'may', 'wish', 'reconsider', 'way', 'out', 'so', 'artistic', 'might', 'just', 'want', 'get', 'enjoy', 'anyway']",N/A
1226258,A3JZ5L52FM318H,B001P9KR8U,"Matthew T. Weflen ""Matthew Weflen""","[3, 6]","The Film:""Slumdog Millionaire"" presents the Horatio Alger story of Jamal, a young, poor kid in the Bombay/Mumbai slums who endures various trials and tribulations to win a TV quiz show, get the girl, and escape his troubled life.The movie is slick and entertaining in the best Hollywood tradition. It puts the protagonists in various dangers, and has them escape in the nick of time, usually with some comeuppance being delivered to the antagonists. ""Slumdog"" offers a gritty portrayal of slum life in Mumbai, to the point where I was left wondering how accurate it really was. The relationship between the two brothers (Jamal and Salim) is relatively interesting. The central love story, between Jamal and Latika, strains credulity just a bit.The casting director did a very good job of matching child actors to their older counterparts, and it lends a nice continuity to the story.Overall, the ending is a bit too pat, much like many Hollywood stories. I also found the central conceit, that Jamal succeeds because ""it is written"" to be troublesome. Isn't this sort of reliance on destiny, social status conferred by birth, and prophecy, the kind of stuff that has held large portions of Indian society back by making them second-class citizens? I am by no means scholar of India's history or society - but I found this notion to be troubling.It's an entertaining movie, but in my opinion it never rises above its material. You can find the same type of story, conflict, and resolution in just about any Hollywood film. A young ""nice guy"" protagonist makes his way through a tough world, is rewarded by the universe for how swell he is, and gets a happy ending. This one just has ""foreign"" trappings. I found it to be a sort of poor man's ""City of God,"" a much better film by Fernando Meirelles.The Blu-Ray:The image in this transfer is relatively detailed, but it suffers from a wildly fluctuating black level throughout. Some scenes have good contrast, while others (usually in dark locales) exist in a grayed-out fog. I get the impression that this movie was filmed on digital, which doesn't handle low light scenes as well as celluloid. Whatever the reason, it just doesn't look very good during these scenes, which I would say comprise about 30% of the film. In its defense, the Blu-Ray offers a very vibrant and colorful image when it is not subject to the hazy mosquito noise of the darker scenes. At its best, this disc looks very good. It's just not always at its best.The DTS audio mix is also seriously problematic. This film switches between very quiet dialogue scenes and EXTREMELY loud action so quickly, (such as trains, gunshots, car crashes, etc.) it threatens to blow out your speakers. Making things more irksome is the heavily accented English - you need to have the dialogue scenes cranked up to really make them out. Essentially, it is impossible to watch this film without subtitles at a lower volume, because of the drastic changes in volume. This plagues the movie throughout. The center channel dialogue never, ever, ever manages to win in any contest with the front and rear channels. I wish they would have just done the film in Hindi with English subtitles. Then I could turn it down and just read the dialogue. Instead, I am forced to fiddle with the volume control for 2 straight hours, trying to anticipate when the next sudden rushing train noise might occur.Which is not to say that the loud stuff is bad. The sound, especially the music, is very rich and has a lot of surround effects. This is nice. But its dynamic range is just too much for the quiet and tender dialogue scenes. They should have leveled it out better.Extras include some making-of material, two commentaries, a music video, and deleted scenes.

1226259,A2XW6Y6NS70JSV,B001P9KR8U,"M. B. DaVega ""pop culture historian""","[30, 45]","Director Danny Boyle's 'Slumdog Millionaire' is a touching, moving and completely riveting cinematic experience. I was blown away not just by its poignant story, but also by its striking contrast in cultural and societal differences from our own here in the Western Hemisphere. In addition to its compelling screenplay, it's also beautifully photographed and captures the backdrop of the dauntingly wretched conditions in the slums of modern-day India as meticulously and realistically as any movie can and probably ever will. The musical score is quite amazing and unlike any other I've ever heard, which hilights several intense dramatic sequences of chasing and running.The story opens up with Jamal Malik (Dev Patel), a seemingly uneducated teenager from the slums of Mumbai who gets a much coveted, one-in-a-million chance to escape from his hopelessly indigent existence by appearing on India's 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?' gameshow where contestants have a chance to win monetary prizes by answering a variety of trivia questions. He's had an unprecedented hot-streak on the show thus far by answering a rather difficult and seemingly esoteric series of questions and in the movie's opening moments, Jamal is just one question shy of winning the grand prize of 20,000,000 rupees. But the show is out of time before he has the opportunity and must reconvene the following night. Following the episode's airing, Jamal is arrested and detained after the police and the show's host (Anil Kapoor) suspect him of cheating. While in poilce custody, Jamal recounts through a series of vivid flashbacks to his childhood that brilliantly reveal how he knows the answers to all of the questions he has answered correctly.We learn that as children growing up in the squalid, nightmarish poverty of Mumbai's slums, Jamal and his older brother, Salim, were orphaned at a young age when their mother was killed in an attack from an angry Hindu mob on their shantytown. Together with their female companion, Latika (whom Jamal loves even as a child), the three band together as a scrappy, self-styled version of 'The Three Musketeers', their favorite literary work from school. They stick together and endure a wretched existence on the muddy streets that is at times despondent and depressing. But this is where the movie's message of hopefulness comes in as the three are a plucky group who display courageous fortitude and spirited resourcefulness despite their trying circumstances. Jamal and Salim become separated from Latika after escaping from a nefarious child exploiter where the two subsequently take to riding the many railroad trains crisscrossing India. The trains become a source of livelihood for the two brothers as they manage to eek out a scant subsistence on the trains by peddling to, hustling and in some cases outright stealing from the trains' passengers. There's even a rather funny passage in this part of the movie where Jamal and Salim end up at the Taj Mahal where they hustle tourists as faux tour guides and even steal their shoes to sell on the streets! The two brothers continue this for several years until they eventually end up in the booming metroplois of Bombay. Here, after becoming employed as a tea server at a mega communications call center, Jamal then gets the opportunity at appearing on the gameshow, something every teenager and young adult in his society longs for. It's at this moment the story segues back into the point we originally see in the movie's beginning. After being grilled and harshly interrogated by the police, Jamal is set free and allowed to continue on his final night of the gameshow after he becomes a national celebrity and hero to the public who demand to see him get his chance to win the grand prize. But having not seen his long-lost love Latika (Freida Pinto) in years, his shot at winning the jackpot is more about reuniting with her than it is about wealth.Slumdog Millionaire is a love story at its core, but there are no sweeping romantic locations and visuals. Jamal, Salim and Latika grow up in a level of squalid, forlorn poverty that makes even the most impoverished American ghettos look like a vision of paradise by comparison. Still, it's surprising how much their culture has been influenced (or polluted) by the West. Interestingly enough, the poor of India are seeming to be as obsessed with gameshows and tv as we are, possibly because it's their sole lifeline to a better existence so few in their society get to experience. A wonderful movie that inspires and teaches us that true knowledge and wisdom comes not from age or education, but from the sum total of our life experiences. A beautifully irreverent and moving cinematic experience with one of the most amazingly original endings and credit sequences I've ever seen in a movie. Always interesting and at times fascinating.

I was drawn to the film after its win at the Golden Globes and after viewing it, I can see why there is so much fuss over it.The story is a familiar one, abliet with a refreshed, updated feel. Young Jamal has become an overnight sensation after his amazing streak on India's ""Who Want To Be a Millionare?"". With just one more question left to win big, the question on everyones mind is, how on earth did this kid from the slums, with no formal education, stable living conditions, and answering questions that have stumped dozens of contestents before. Slowly, we are taken back in time and shown Jamal's life, as each question he is asked pretains to a certain event in his life. All the while, he hopes to find the love he lost long ago, and maybe even come on top.The film literally crackles with intensity. The locations are awashed in a bright gold color, the camera is fast and moving (though no so much to make you dizzy), and the music is so lively and kinetic that it's almost like your actually in the movie with these characters, with Danny Boyle being the main person involved in this, injecting so much life and vibrancy that the film just pops off the screen. He also manages to equally balance the drama, humor, and tenderness of the screenplay without it coming off as to heavy handed.All the cast members do great, and while there is no particular standout, they all equally play of each other and hold their own scenes, with no one being overshadowed or underplayed.But what I really liked about the film was that (minor spoiler) unlike most other drama films, by the end of the film, you feel so happy and lifted that you just want to jump up and down as Jamal goes for the million dollars. I can't remember the last time a movie has actually made me grab my seat in suspense, baiting my breath, hoping and praying that Jamal actually wins it all and gets the girl. Plus, the Bollywood dance at the end was just so spectacular.Slumdog Millionare is definintly one of the best films of 2008, and whether your a Bollywood fan, drama person, awards seeker, this is the film that has everything for everyone.

He is accused of cheating and is taken into custody. The authorities grill him on how a boy from the slums was able to answer every question on the show. Jamal explains question by question how he knew the answers, and also giving away his life story.

The director uses flashbacks in a confusing manner starting with an adult Jamal being tortured in a Mumbai police station.  We are then treated to all kinds of flashbacks with an adult Jamal playing the India version of Who Wants to be a Millionaire and a very poor kid Jamal being abused by his bully brother Salim.  Salim locks Jamal in an outhouse when the local celebrity comes to visit their villiage.  The only way Jamal can get out is to fall in the cesspool beneath the outhouse.  A Jamal covered with feces is able to get an autograph from the star.Jamal's misery is intensified as his brother sells his Jamal's autographed photo and then a bunch of rioters kill the boys' mother.  The two boys escape the rioters to be taken in by some criminals that are trafficing and exploiting young children.  The boys eventually escape but Salim twarts the escape of Jamal's female friend Latika.The movie follows them as they grow up and Jamal is constantly searching for his friend Latika.  The movie shifts constantly between the present day torture in the police station, Jamal answering questions on the TV game show and the boys story growing up.All through their life Salim is bad to Jamal and Jamal can never seem to find happiness without Latika.  I really liked most of the film but I found the constant flashbacks and time shifts to be annoying.  Also, the subtitles when needed were virtually impossible to read.  Jamal's game show experience did not seem believable except if the movie were to be labelled a fantasy.I did like the Bollywood number that the director threw in to the end.  I liked the Paper Planes song that is played in part of the movie.One of the better movies of 2008 but not the epic film that many make this movie out to be.",4,A Really Good Film but not as Great As I Was Led To Believe!,1258329600,"11 16, 2009",2009,1846,"['enjoyed', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'was', 'as', 'great', 'hype', 'received', 'director', 'flashbacks', 'confusing', 'manner', 'starting', 'adult', 'Jamal', 'being', 'tortured', 'Mumbai', 'police', 'station', 'are', 'then', 'treated', 'kinds', 'flashbacks', 'adult', 'Jamal', 'playing', 'India', 'version', 'Who', 'be', 'Millionaire', 'very', 'poor', 'kid', 'Jamal', 'being', 'abused', 'bully', 'Salim', 'Salim', 'Jamal', 'outhouse', 'when', 'local', 'celebrity', 'visit', 'villiage', 'only', 'way', 'Jamal', 'can', 'get', 'out', 'fall', 'cesspool', 'outhouse', 'Jamal', 'covered', 'feces', 'able', 'get', 'autograph', 'star.Jamal', 'misery', 'intensified', 'brother', 'Jamal', 'autographed', 'photo', 'then', 'bunch', 'rioters', 'kill', 'boys', 'mother', 'two', 'boys', 'escape', 'rioters', 'be', 'taken', 'criminals', 'are', 'trafficing', 'exploiting', 'young', 'children', 'boys', 'eventually', 'escape', 'Salim', 'escape', 'Jamal', 'female', 'friend', 'Latika.The', 'movie', 'grow', 'up', 'Jamal', 'constantly', 'searching', 'friend', 'Latika', 'movie', 'constantly', 'present', 'day', 'torture', 'police', 'station', 'Jamal', 'answering', 'questions', 'TV', 'game', 'show', 'boys', 'story', 'growing', 'up.All', 'life', 'Salim', 'bad', 'Jamal', 'Jamal', 'can', 'never', 'seem', 'find', 'happiness', 'Latika', 'really', 'liked', 'most', 'film', 'found', 'constant', 'flashbacks', 'time', 'shifts', 'be', 'annoying', 'Also', 'subtitles', 'when', 'needed', 'were', 'virtually', 'impossible', 'read', 'Jamal', 'game', 'show', 'experience', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'believable', 'movie', 'were', 'be', 'labelled', 'fantasy.I', 'did', 'Bollywood', 'number', 'director', 'threw', 'end', 'liked', 'Paper', 'Planes', 'song', 'played', 'part', 'movie.One', 'better', 'movies', '2008', 'not', 'epic', 'film', 'many', 'make', 'movie', 'be']",N/A

It has 12 deleted scenes and several other bonus features that some dvd pressings did not have evidently.  You have 156 people mostly telling you that this is a great movie, and are they all correct? Absolutely , this is a great movie that has strong characters and is easy enough to follow even though the story jumps from the police station to the game show and back into the past of the main character. This seems confusing but it's not at all. The story is a solid story of the terrible conditions the poor are facing in the hugely overpopulated democratic country of India.  The picture deeerved it's best picture oscar because it tells it's story well , and it is as well acted as any A budget movie made anywhere else in the world.  This isn't bollywood though; a type of movie which had musical numbers thrown into the middle of it and which has it's place in world cinema; this is straight forward filmaking with solid direction and a more western style of storytelling.  Which is why it holds up well against the many other great movies made in the last 100 years and rightly joins them as a top effort in film.  The story of a slumdog orphan escaping poverty and by strange coincidences having his life mirror the questions on the Indian version of ""Who wants to be a millionaire!"".  The actor who plays the host of the show also creates a  very engaging and interesting character. He is all about himself yet not a villian and he certainly doesn't like to be reminded that he was once himself a slumdog.  The blu ray looks great and the sound is excellent.

The story revolves around an impoverished and uneducated Indian man who is one question away from winning the Indian equivalent of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. First he is captured by police forces who simply cannot believe that this impoverished man is one question away from winning the ultimate prize. This leads the viewer on a back-tracking whirlwind through the life of this man through his childhood, the formation of the three Musketeers with his childhood friend Salim and his eventual love interest. Jamal and Salim eventual take off, leaving Latika to become an exotic dancer known as Cherry until the two friends retain to rescue their Third Musketeer.Eventually Salim turns on Jamal to become a hired gunmen for an Indian muscle-man ejecting Jamal from his life and separating him from Latika once again. The style of this movie is a bit bothersome for me because it comes across as an our and half period of flashback ended with a half an hour of present time period action. There had to have been a better way to do it than just stuff that felt like constant flashback. Still I can't complain about the cinematography because they made India look at once bright, beautiful, and hopeful through colors, but yet dangerous through the blacks, whites, and grays of thug life and things lost.

While nothing in life ever works like that I think it made a really nice story.Basically the movie was exactly what I thought it would be. It was good but I wouldn't call it great. I heard from tons of people how wonderful it was but also from a few friends (who have similar tastes) who said it was good but not THE BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME, and I would have to agree with them.

1226275,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B001P9KR8U,mirasreviews,"[0, 1]","""Slumdog Millionaire"" is a bilingual British-Indian production based on the novel ""Q & A"" by Loveleen Tandan, which I understand has been modified considerably be screenwriter Simon Beaufoy. Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) is an 18-year-old tea-server originally from the slums of Mumbai. In an attempt to reach the woman he loves (Freida Pinto), he becomes a contestant on the Indian version of ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"". He gets so close to the grand prize of 20 million rupees that he is suspected of cheating and arrested. He tries to convince a jaded police inspector (Irfan Khan) that he really did know the answer to the questions by recounting the episodes in his life from which he learned them.This is an optimistic romance that is coy about being either of those things most of the time. It generates a lot of energy but has a startling edge. The audience is hit full force with Jamal's violent life as a street child. Shifts back and forth in time, between Jamal's interrogation, his appearance on the show, and his recollections of years past can be jarring at first. But the frenetic energy of it all matches that of the slums and of life on the run for Jamal and his brother Salim. Irfan Khan can play any role, and he is terrific here as a detective whose patience is wearing thin but whose curiosity gets the better of him, even though he's not such a nice guy.There have been a lot of sleazy characters in Jamal's life, and the film is populated with them. Jamal is the proverbial nice guy from the wrong side of the tracks who has been hindered by circumstances and unscrupulous people. Yet he is savvy and single-minded. His brother Salim (Madhur Mittal) is almost Jamal's alter-ego, a bully who chose a life of crime to get ahead. But he is equally savvy and single-minded, with a different value system. The love-hate relationship between the two men brings a lot of substance to the story. ""Slumdog Millionaire""'s amalgamation of gritty reality, upbeat rhythms, and clich&eacute;d optimism make it a unique, enjoyable experience.

And it was with the expectation of LOVING this movie that my husband and I went to it today. And unwisely brought our very mature 13 year old son with us.(Note: I'm not a careless parent, far from it. This was the first R rated movie we've ever taken him to. I read about Slumdog online extensively - but I guess I chose to deny the few comments such as ""tough to watch"" and ""rough"" in favor of the many, many comments and critic reviews that RAVED about how wonderful, inspirational and uplifting this movie was.)Well. What these little children endure in this story--the brutal, vicious, hopeless, filthy, disgusting, violent, despairing, depressing nature of their lives--cannot be emphasized enough. This is not presented in a tame way. It will turn your stomach and make you turn your head away, for at least the first hour, which is when I walked out, sat down on a bench outside the theater, and sobbed.It was an ingenious and engaging idea for a story, and well done.

The commercials will mislead you into thinking this is ""a romantic adventure about a poor kid doing well on a game show.""

Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad movie.  It's just not the great one I was expecting after all of the awards.  It makes me wonder about the people who are giving out these award nominations....this, the God-awful Doubt, and Milk are three movies I will probably never watch again in my entire life yet they were nominated for every award imaginable.  I don't know maybe I am wrong in the point that movies are supposed to be an exciting way to entertain you for 2 hours.  Maybe these movies have some hidden meaning or artistic cinematography or some other term I am too dumb to understand, but one thing they aren't are a fun time at the theaters.  I think I would rather watch an actual carton of Milk for 2 hours than watch the actual movie Milk again.  And I don't even want to get started on the movie Doubt.  It's sad that The Dark Knight, one of the highest grossing films of all time, was not even nominated for best picture yet these movies were.  If the great Heath Ledger had not unfortunately passed on way too soon he also probably would of been snubbed.  Anyway...back to the movie.Like I said this movie isn't that bad.  It reminds me a little of a far superior film called City of God.  It tells the life in flashbacks of a boy while he is on the Indian version of Who Wants to be a Millionaire.  The movie jumps around so much it is kind of hard to follow, and it seems like there is some scene with kids running around while it plays some sort of weird Indian rap music way too often.

It was interesting and kept me captivated on what was going to happen next.Jamal (Dev Patel among other actors), a young boy from the slums of India and his brother Salim (Madhur Mittal among other actors) sadly lose their mother early to a violent death.  While most of the movie starts from when they are very young, the different scenes show them growing up and fending for themselves on the streets.More of the plot however, centers around Jamal being on the show of India's version of ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire.""  One question away from winning the grand prize, he is forced into police custody and tortured to see how he is winning (they believe he is cheating).  Instead, he tells them how he knows the answers and in doing so, gives them the story of his life.  Prominently featured in these stories is Latika (Freida Pinto among others) who is a young girl who joins them in their travails after their mother's death.Each question a new part of Jamal's life is uncovered.  Most of it is very brutal; to be sure there are not many happy parts in this movie.  Now as a contestant on this show, his only thought is to get Latika back, which could prove very dangerous.For warning, this movie is very graphic.  It features beatings, murders, and other acts of violence.  Definitely not a good movie for the younger crowd.  It is realistically done though so I could imagine things like this happening.The characters were well played I thought.  Dev Patel especially as Jamal did great at portraying his worry over Latika and his quest to find her.  For some reason the actor who played his brother reminded me of Michael Jackson in his younger years, but it was only mildly distracting from the movie.  All the other characters seemed authentic enough as well.  The only character that wasn't truly amazing to me was the older Latika, while she was quite beautiful, there wasn't a lot of depth that went into her character like there was for the rest of them.The music in this movie was fantastic.  It was a mix of Indian/English so while a non-Indian dialect speaker might not be able to understand some of the lyrics, there were some that could be understood.  They had great rhythm and fit the flow of the story nicely.Overall a great movie.  There was a lot of action but enough story to keep you engaged in the characters.  I truly cared about how the ending would turn out and was pleasantly surprised and equally as shocked at the results.

1226283,A3ZMC6NFTXEKO,B001P9KR8U,"M. R. Griffin ""griffinfinity""","[1, 1]","I love foreign films. I feel this way because storytelling comes first. If explosions, skin or violence is required to accurately tell their stories, so be it. But the story is everything in films made outside the USA. When I think of great `story' based films, `The Usual Suspects' (USA), `Run Lola Run' (Germany), and `Roshomon' (Japan) come to mind. There is only one element to these films that is similar. They all involve a recounting or revisiting of events that lead up to the finale. `Slumdog Millionaire' belongs in this category as well.This film has the courage to go almost two-hours. The `standard' for movies these days is 90 minutes. That's mainly because studios listen more to focus groups than directors. The same standard applied in the sixties with record releases. The cardinal rule: never go over three minutes in length. This `wisdom' was obliterated when FM radio and `album oriented rock' ushered in an era of unprecedented creativity. In 'Slumdog Millionaire', Writer, Simon Beaufoy, Editor, Chris Dickens, and Directors, Danny Boyle & Loveleen Tandan complimented each other in a magnificent display of ensemble work behind the scenes. The precious extra minutes were used unselfishly and gave the story room to breath, and ultimately triumphAnother aspect of risk (beautifully handled here) was in seaming together multiple time periods. Many potentially excellent films are ruined as the story gets lost in the time tunnels, and confusion ensues. In `Slumdog Millionaire', we have three characters, interpreted by nine actors. Six of them being children. Each part was brilliantly acted, and the continuity was allowed to develop clearly and naturally. Again, Directors, Danny Boyle & Loveleen Tandan were the reason it worked. They say you get what you give, and they must have been quite generous with the young cast.I would be negligent not to mention a marvelous supporting cast. Not to be outshone, the people and settings throughout were spectacular. Cinematographer, Anthony Dod Mantle, made the most of capturing an amazing country. The film was shot entirely in India. A few months before viewing `Slumdog Millionaire' I was extremely fortunate to have seen the amazing documentary `Story of India' on public television. I am certain that it enhanced this film for me.`Slumdog Millionaire' is funny, adventurous, cruel, dramatic and clever. Boyle and wove all of these elements into pure delight. A.R. Rahman's score set the tone for lively, dramatic and humorous sequences. At the end of the film, I felt a sigh of relief; having already known everyone mentioned in this piece was recognized for their excellence. I don't know why, but when I have experienced outstanding film making, I want everyone else to have the same chance as well. If this piece was truly headed straight to DVD, one wonders if it would have been seen at all.Much speculation has occurred in Hollywood over the connection, particularly financial, with Bollywood. But here is yet another example of something originating from outside of Hollywood that is literally defines `world class' film making. I hope the global boundaries that are falling `flat' in the business world take root in movies as well. Here's hoping that we can do away with the preface and just call them `films'.",4,Hooray for Bollywood!...,1245801600,"06 24, 2009",2009,3295,"['love', 'foreign', 'films', 'feel', 'way', 'storytelling', 'first', 'explosions', 'skin', 'violence', 'required', 'accurately', 'tell', 'stories', 'so', 'be', 'story', 'everything', 'films', 'made', 'USA', 'When', 'think', 'great', 'story', 'based', 'films', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'USA', 'Run', 'Lola', 'Run', 'Germany', 'Roshomon', 'Japan', 'come', 'mind', 'only', 'one', 'element', 'films', 'similar', 'involve', 'recounting', 'revisiting', 'events', 'lead', 'up', 'finale', 'Slumdog', 'Millionaire', 'belongs', 'category', 'well.This', 'film', 'courage', 'go', 'almost', 'two-hours', 'standard', 'movies', 'days', '90', 'minutes', 'mainly', 'studios', 'listen', 'more', 'focus', 'groups', 'directors', 'same', 'standard', 'applied', 'sixties', 'record', 'releases', 'cardinal', 'rule', 'never', 'go', 'over', 'three', 'minutes', 'length', 'wisdom', 'was', 'obliterated', 'when', 'FM', 'radio', 'album', 'oriented', 'rock', 'ushered', 'era', 'unprecedented', 'creativity', ""'Slumdog"", 'Millionaire', 'Writer', 'Simon', 'Beaufoy', 'Editor', 'Chris', 'Dickens', 'Directors', 'Danny', 'Boyle', 'Loveleen', 'Tandan', 'complimented', 'other', 'magnificent', 'display', 'ensemble', 'work', 'scenes', 'precious', 'extra', 'minutes', 'were', 'used', 'unselfishly', 'gave', 'story', 'room', 'breath', 'ultimately', 'triumphAnother', 'aspect', 'risk', 'beautifully', 'handled', 'here', 'was', 'seaming', 'together', 'multiple', 'time', 'periods', 'Many', 'potentially', 'excellent', 'films', 'are', 'ruined', 'story', 'lost', 'time', 'tunnels', 'confusion', 'ensues', 'Slumdog', 'Millionaire', 'have', 'three', 'characters', 'interpreted', 'nine', 'actors', 'Six', 'being', 'children', 'part', 'was', 'brilliantly', 'acted', 'continuity', 'was', 'allowed', 'develop', 'clearly', 'naturally', 'Again', 'Directors', 'Danny', 'Boyle', 'Loveleen', 'Tandan', 'were', 'reason', 'worked', 'say', 'get', 'what', 'give', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'quite', 'generous', 'young', 'cast.I', 'would', 'be', 'negligent', 'not', 'mention', 'marvelous', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Not', 'be', 'outshone', 'people', 'settings', 'were', 'spectacular', 'Cinematographer', 'Anthony', 'Dod', 'Mantle', 'made', 'most', 'capturing', 'amazing', 'country', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'entirely', 'India', 'A', 'few', 'months', 'viewing', 'Slumdog', 'Millionaire', 'was', 'extremely', 'fortunate', 'have', 'seen', 'amazing', 'documentary', 'Story', 'India', 'public', 'television', 'am', 'certain', 'enhanced', 'film', 'me.', 'Slumdog', 'Millionaire', 'funny', 'adventurous', 'cruel', 'dramatic', 'clever', 'Boyle', 'wove', 'elements', 'pure', 'delight', 'A.R', 'Rahman', 'score', 'set', 'tone', 'lively', 'dramatic', 'humorous', 'sequences', 'end', 'film', 'felt', 'sigh', 'relief', 'having', 'already', 'known', 'everyone', 'mentioned', 'piece', 'was', 'recognized', 'excellence', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'when', 'have', 'experienced', 'outstanding', 'film', 'making', 'want', 'everyone', 'else', 'have', 'same', 'chance', 'well', 'piece', 'was', 'truly', 'headed', 'straight', 'DVD', 'one', 'wonders', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'seen', 'all.Much', 'speculation', 'occurred', 'Hollywood', 'connection', 'particularly', 'financial', 'Bollywood', 'here', 'yet', 'example', 'something', 'originating', 'outside', 'Hollywood', 'literally', 'defines', 'world', 'class', 'film', 'making', 'hope', 'global', 'boundaries', 'are', 'falling', 'flat', 'business', 'world', 'take', 'root', 'movies', 'well', 'Here', 'hoping', 'can', 'do', 'away', 'preface', 'just', 'call', 'films']",N/A

It is endlessly diverting, constantly surprising and yet consistent. The inventive camera movements don't so much call attention to the director as they capture a complex and confusing reality into which impoverished Indian teen Jamal Malik has been thrown.The telling of the story is both remarkably simple and highly effective: Jamal Malik has gone further than anyone on the Indian version of ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?""  Since he is a ""slumdog"" from Mumbai, the authorities assume he must be cheating and interrogate him harshly in order to extract a confession.  Instead, he begins to relate incidents from his harrowing life that explain exactly how he came to know each answer.  His real interest in being on the show, it turns out, is not to become wealthy but to reconnect with a lost childhood friend Latika.One very refreshing element of this film is that instead of making coincidence a liability -- all romantic dramas employ coincidence in order to increase the tension and excitement -- the filmmakers build the entire premise around the possibility that fate can determine a life and can bring lost loves together.  I was also impressed by the way the film paid homage to numerous traditions of filmmaking, but mostly to Bollywood cinema -- even including an exhuberant musical number.  One thing I hope for this film, in fact, is that it may serve to introduce more Western audiences to Bollywood film (many of the actors here are popular in Bollywood) and prepare them for the many delights that can be found there.",4,Heartwarming love story against the backdrop of heartbreaking circumstances,1357257600,"01 4, 2013",2013,1976,"['delightful', 'exhilarating', 'film', 'pathos', 'excitement', 'over-the-top', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'classical', 'Hollywood-style', 'romances', 'dark', 'gritty', 'portrayal', 'life', 'streets', 'India', 'filmed', 'excitingly', 'kinetic', 'style', 'different', 'kinds', 'footage', 'create', 'hyperreal', 'Mumbai.Danny', 'Boyle', 'Trainspotting,28', 'Days', 'Later', 'Beach', 'really', 'outdone', 'one', 'endlessly', 'diverting', 'constantly', 'surprising', 'yet', 'consistent', 'inventive', 'camera', 'movements', 'do', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'call', 'attention', 'director', 'capture', 'complex', 'confusing', 'reality', 'impoverished', 'Indian', 'teen', 'Jamal', 'Malik', 'been', 'thrown.The', 'telling', 'story', 'remarkably', 'simple', 'highly', 'effective', 'Jamal', 'Malik', 'gone', 'further', 'anyone', 'Indian', 'version', 'Who', 'be', 'Millionaire', 'slumdog', 'Mumbai', 'authorities', 'assume', 'must', 'be', 'cheating', 'interrogate', 'harshly', 'order', 'extract', 'confession', 'Instead', 'relate', 'incidents', 'harrowing', 'life', 'exactly', 'how', 'came', 'know', 'answer', 'real', 'interest', 'being', 'show', 'out', 'not', 'become', 'wealthy', 'reconnect', 'lost', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Latika.One', 'very', 'refreshing', 'element', 'film', 'instead', 'making', 'coincidence', 'liability', 'romantic', 'dramas', 'employ', 'coincidence', 'order', 'increase', 'tension', 'excitement', 'filmmakers', 'build', 'entire', 'premise', 'possibility', 'fate', 'can', 'determine', 'life', 'can', 'bring', 'lost', 'together', 'was', 'also', 'impressed', 'way', 'film', 'paid', 'homage', 'numerous', 'traditions', 'filmmaking', 'mostly', 'Bollywood', 'cinema', 'even', 'including', 'exhuberant', 'musical', 'number', 'One', 'thing', 'hope', 'film', 'fact', 'may', 'serve', 'introduce', 'more', 'Western', 'audiences', 'Bollywood', 'film', 'many', 'actors', 'here', 'are', 'popular', 'Bollywood', 'prepare', 'many', 'delights', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'there']",N/A

This is exactly what happened when I saw this film near Christmas. Some of us had tears in our eyes. I've never seen a response like that for any film, much less a mid-budget production with no A-list talent. SLUMDDOG MILLIONAIRE is that good. It deserves the 4 golden globes it has already won, and should be a strong contender for Best Picture in February.A straightforward premise guides this film: Jamal, a contestant on the Indian version of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, has successfully answered all but the final question facing him. One more correct answer and he will win the prize of 20 million Rupes. Before he can answer the show ends for the night and he is arrested under suspicion that he is cheating to win. It turns out that Jamal is a 'Slumdog,' a former resident of the largest and nastiest slums in Mumbai. Because of lack formal education the police are convinced he must be cheating to have had so much success on the game show.He is taken in for interrogation, complete with torture, to force him to admit he is cheating. The rest of the movie consists of Jamal explaining how he knew each answer, which are shown in flash-backs of the events in his life which taught him the answers. The scenes with the police are very well done and are reminiscent of THE USUAL SUSPECTS. Jamal, sullen, tired, and unusually honest, explains his life and current circumstances with a gripping urgency that correlates well with the vignettes from his past. We learn of his escape from the slums, his survival buy whatever means necessary, and of his great love, Latika.The film starts with a wild chase through the slums, Jamal and his older brother Salim running from the police, afraid and yet taunting the them at the same time. This intro is sheer genius, painting the boy's environs as well as their personalities with deft strokes. We learn that Salim is a risk taker, that Jamal follows his older brother's lead, that the slum is a horrific place to grow up, and that despite that, it is filled with the vibrancy and hope of human endeavor. Danny Boyle, in an interview on the NPR program FRESH AIR, said that originally they shot the opener in English, but that it just didn't feel right. Only after switching to Hindi did the scene successfully convey the slum and its inhabitants.There are several remarkable things about this film. First is that because it is comprised of many flashbacks, there are three actors each for Jamal, Salim, and Latika that portray them at different ages. All of them nail their roles. There is no let down at any point. The viewer never doubts the continuity of the characters. Each actor delivers a powerful, believable performance that resonates with the viewer.Another high quality element is the carefully assembled plot that never becomes predictable, despite the ending being fairly obvious from the beginning of the film. SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE is shockingly original, and sometimes just shocking. The film is gritty and frightening, and doesn't shy away from the harsher realities of growing up in a slum or the consequences of bad choices. The characters are believable, the sets are perfect, and the dramatic moments as intense as the well done action sequences.Finally, near the end of the film when the various themes of the movie are being woven together, the viewer is allowed to see the full impact of Jamal on the world around him. As 60 million viewers tune in to see if he will be allowed to answer the final question, we see Jamal as much more than a Slumdog with a chance to become vastly wealthy. He is the embodiment of hope. Hope that we can escape the grimness of our circumstances, hope that love can overcome desperation, and hope that even people that seem lost can find redemption.If you've seenRun Lola Runyou might understand what I mean by saying this is a movie that requires the viewer to believe that hope is more than a just feeling. It is equal parts force of nature and destiny, and something worth contending for. It is also similar to RUN LOLA RUN by featuring a soundtrack heavy with electronic dance music that somehow fits the film perfectly.The closing scene is very well done. Without ruining it, the director shows a restraint that makes it poignant. As it unfolds, I was thinking ""if only Boyle is smart enough to end it here, the film will be perfect,"" and then he does. CASABLANCA like in impact, there were few in the the showing I attended who were not moved.An epic, beautiful film that will move you, this is the best film of 2008.

From Shallow Grave, to Trainspotting, to 28 Days Later, to Millions, to Sunshine; he's always managed to deliver visually striking, hypnotic, and intelligent films.  Slumdog Millionaire has proved to be Boyle's most celebrated film yet, as the Oscar darling has captured the hearts and minds of viewers across the globe.  As a fan of Boyle's work, I can honestly say that I'm not in love with it as much as everyone else seems to be, but that aside, Slumdog Millionaire remains a powerful film that should be seen whether you be a Boyle fan or not.  With all the attention it has received, going into the film's storyline would only seem redundant at this point, but what I will say is that Slumdog Millionaire finds Boyle at his technical best.  The editing, sound design, and music are beautifully done, and the film manages to keep a kinetic pace throughout its two hour running time as well.  All in all, while I don't think Slumdog Millionaire was quite the masterpiece that a majority of viewers do, it is a powerful, engaging, and incredibly compelling work that will stay with you after the credits roll, and is by all means definitely worth seeing.",4,"Powerful indeed, but somewhat overrated",1238544000,"04 1, 2009",2009,1254,"['love', 'Danny', 'Boyle', 'death', 'nearly', 'everything', 'done', 'seen', 'light', 'day', 'Shallow', 'Grave', 'Trainspotting', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'Millions', 'Sunshine', 'always', 'managed', 'deliver', 'visually', 'striking', 'hypnotic', 'intelligent', 'films', 'Slumdog', 'Millionaire', 'proved', 'be', 'Boyle', 'most', 'celebrated', 'film', 'yet', 'Oscar', 'darling', 'captured', 'hearts', 'minds', 'viewers', 'globe', 'fan', 'Boyle', 'work', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', ""'m"", 'not', 'love', 'as', 'much', 'everyone', 'else', 'be', 'aside', 'Slumdog', 'Millionaire', 'powerful', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'Boyle', 'fan', 'not', 'attention', 'received', 'going', 'film', 'storyline', 'would', 'only', 'seem', 'redundant', 'point', 'what', 'will', 'say', 'Slumdog', 'Millionaire', 'Boyle', 'technical', 'best', 'editing', 'sound', 'design', 'music', 'are', 'beautifully', 'done', 'film', 'keep', 'kinetic', 'pace', 'two', 'hour', 'running', 'time', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Slumdog', 'Millionaire', 'was', 'quite', 'masterpiece', 'majority', 'viewers', 'do', 'powerful', 'engaging', 'incredibly', 'compelling', 'work', 'will', 'stay', 'credits', 'roll', 'means', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing']",N/A

Jamal and Silam become separated from Lakita in the midst of a daring escape from a gangster. For years thereafter, Jamal searches for Lakita.

1226297,AW9QRZNFIT95F,B001P9KR8U,"Phoenix ""AZ""","[5, 13]","The movie starts off very well, MIA/AV Rahman's O'Saya (MIA was robbed of an Oscar for this) kick starts the movie with the kids ....young Jamal in particular and the ride starts....Its an amazing beginning for this ride....Like a 747 taking off that requires maximum thrust at take off, the song ""O'Saya"" and its intensity was what gave the lifting thrust along with the cute kids running with equal intensity . I have never seen a movie that started with such a bang. However, it peters out soon and by the time the adult Jamal's is in the story, it becomes a cheesy film to tie the lose ends.The good thing I liked about this was the showcasing of the slums as it is for real. The slums and the extreme poverty in India is the work of the congress party (The liberal left). they have ruled India almost 85% of the time since independence and this is what they have to show for it. China seems to have done so much better. India's liberal lefties have failed India miserably. It's time to stop India's anarchy (disguised as liberty) and get a China like government in place to clean up the mess.Recently New Delhi Municipal did not allow new slums to be built in the city...and the left was out in full force demanding the right of poor migrants from rural areas to live wherever they want. India's left help build these slums. and then they have the audacity to point it out and tell the world...""hey look... these poor people are living in slums"" while they have controlled India for the most part(government).so at least we got to see that.There is also this interesting thread in this story. The relationship between Jamal and his ""evil"" brother Salim. This was fascinating. Salim was not an one dimensional character.  Salim has let down  his younger brother a few times...but where it mattered, Salim came through for his brother. Jamal knew it when he tried to explain to Latika that his brother would help them. He knew his brother.One more thing I did not care for, was the originaly story (Q&A;) had a pedophile Christian priest exploiting the kids. This was conveniently left out of the story and the ""Hindus"" killing the Muslims was introduced that was not in the original story.  India is a country where you hear Islamic terrorism almost every month. This was PC at its worst.So all in all there were some very nice parts...particularly the kids. They were amazing. I guess, its worth at least one watch for the kids performance.There are couple of songs that you may want to download for your ipods.1. O'Saya (MIA and A V Rahman)2.

The film runs not only in constant flashback segments, but it also has a fractured and fragmented style of editing that was both confusing and art house experimental in style. The entire film seemed confused with it's self and what it was trying to present it's self as. For instance, when MIA's excellent track 'Paper Planes' was thrown into a scene, the film took a direction that felt like an experimental music video, tourist commercial, or some kind of low budget after school special. The film uses jolty and dizzying camera angles sometimes, and then other moments those camera techniques are dismissed in favor of more traditional ones. Our main characters are supposed to feel to us like tortured children who are caught in great exploitation and misfortune, yet when the audience might just begin to feel concerned about them they become deceptive thieves who would go as far to commit murder. I also felt it was not very appealing to showcase India's government officials as those who would commit torture on one of their citizens simply because he won a vast amount of money on a game show. That to me was rediculous. To add insult to injury the film is filled with constant depressing landscapes and violent moments, and much of the comic relief was bizzare and over the top. In my opinion this film contains nothing that should garner it even a single academy award nomination, much less a best picture nod.

Jamal has lived a tough life and every tragedy and misfortune was etched in his memory.  His seemimgly emotionless reaction to each correct answer on ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire"" was a testimony to the suffering the answer brought to mind.

It is a unique masterpiece that grabs the viewer on several levels: the story, the setting, the acting and the cinematography.  SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE is the story of how Jamal, a young, uneducated man, from India's lowliest slums, working in the most menial of jobs, achieves unprecedented success as a contestant on ""Who Wants to Be A Millionaire?"" It seems impossible to believe that he would have the kind of knowledge to answer a wide assortment of questions that clearly would appear to be outside his scope of experience.  But therein lies the brilliance of the film: how he knows the answers to each question is woven into the fabric of his life's experiences and told in flashback.Orphaned at a very young age when their mother is brutally murdered, Jamal and his older brother Salim, survive amidst trash dumps. Their lives are brutally harsh and made more so when they become ensnared by a professional gang of beggars, and later when they do what they must to eke out a living.  Yet in each vignette of their lives something occurs that provides Jamal with the critical knowledge he uses later on the TV program.

Set in India, story covers the life of a young man of muslim descent who along with his older brother becomes an orphan at early age.  Without parents, they do whatever it takes to survive in a world.  Younger one, Jamal becomes a contestant on indian version of the show ""Who wants to be a millionaire?"".  Show seems to be the only way to conquer poverty an destitute for a young man with no education or any other prospects.When his answers lead him on top of the game, he arouses suspicions of the show host of being a cheat and impostor.  Jamal is kidnapped by a local police nad subjected to brutal interrogation in attempt to find out how he cheated,  It is during this interrogation that becomes obvious that events in this young man's life seem to have led to his knowledge on all answers to his questions.Good music, solid acting (Dev Patel is over the top, but Freida Pinto is natural), but not so convincing story.

1226310,A1U8DHSI18EEJ1,B001P9KR8U,Richard E. Noble,"[1, 2]","MovieSlumdog MillionaireReviewBy Richard E. NobleThis movie is touted as ""the feel good movie of the year."" Anybody who watched this movie and left feeling good about it, in my opinion, is lacking in something vital to their social conscience.I don't know what the creators' intentions were with this film but I will certainly not be planning my next getaway vacation to India.After watching this movie, I am left feeling much as I did after watching the movie, ""Midnight Express."" I was happy for the man's release from the Turkish prison in Midnight Express, just as I am happy for the two slumdogs who are the protagonists in this movie.I definitely think this movie warrants praise and it deserves any awards that have been accorded to it but it certainly didn't make me feel good. It made me feel very, very bad.A slumdog appears to be India's modern day equivalent to what was once referred to in that culture as ""Untouchables."" The word ""slumdog"" is, of course, meant to be derogatory. An English equivalent might be dirtbag or scumbag.India once suffered under what was called a caste system and it appears from this movie that they still do.Supposedly this caste system belief is a part of the Hindu religion and its notion of reincarnation and Karma. It is a system of social stratification and a person's karma,his behavior in his previous lives, determines his position in his present life.The karma of certain people is so bad that they are placed in a caste not included in even the lowest caste of the caste system.They are the Untouchables or the Dolits.I remember reading about the horrid lives of these poor Untouchables decades ago.I thought Dickens' ""Oliver Twist"" was a horror story until I began reading about the real lives of the Untouchables in the non-fiction Indian culture.These people lived in garbage dumps and scavenged and begged for their survival. The parents in these families would cripple, maim and blind their children so as to make them better beggars and increase their beggary dividends.If I can believe this movie, it does not appear that much has changed in the Indian culture of today. I think it was George Orwell who stated, in his trekking India travelogue, that India would never become a great country because of its Hindu beliefs and the Hindu acceptance of fate and destiny and consequently poverty and social injustice and inequality. Considering the impressions left by this movie, I think he makes a good point.This movie undermines all that I have been reading lately about the new India and the social progress it has been making over the past few decades.That there are people living in India today who are boasting that they will soon be the leading economic culture in the world boggles my imagination. Much worse than that is the notion that if this actually were to be the case, the picture of the future that this film paints for the world is bleak indeed.On the surface this is a love story. But unfortunately the moral, only revealed at the conclusion of the movie is one from that old time religion based on the Hindu notion of karma, destiny and fate.So it seems that the Hindu caste system and the faith that spawned it are still alive and well in modern day India - at least according to this movie.The male hero's mother is murdered as she washes her clothes in some filthy pool of water. Her murder is not explained other than it had something to do with rivaling religious fanatics.The two sons are now orphaned slumdogs. They are captured by a Faganesque, drug dealing gangster. He tortures, maims and brutalizes his captives to keep them in line and enhance their beggary. The two brothers and the younger brother's little girlfriend attempt an escape before the younger boy is blinded by his tortures.The boys escape but the little girl does not catch the train and remains with the drug dealing gangster and his gang of cutthroats. The remainder of this tale centers on this couple's reunification.Somehow mixed in here in this slum ridden, horror show of a country, a modern day TV program is incorporated into the film. As hard as it is to believe, the younger brother has matured and is a contestant on the TV show, an Indian version of ""Who wants to be a millionaire.""The show ends in a Michael Jackson type dance celebration and production extravaganza.As I said in the beginning of this review, I do not know the real intentions of the creators of this film but they left a huge impression on me.Unfortunately that impression is extremely negative.At one point in the movie, one of the characters says to somebody,""Well, you wanted to see a true picture of the real India, didn't you?""My god! Thank-you very much but I've seen enough of the ""real"" India to last me a good while.The Hobo Philosopher is a writer and the author of ""Hooked on Books"" among others.",3,The Hobo

Verious plot holes for this movie have been explained to me and I have to agree with a good amount of them or respect that point of view. So here's what I enjoyed about it. The movie is pretty good at giving a sense you are in India, in that parts of the movie feel as if this is indeed a less developed country, and as the movie progress you see skyscrapers and some western elements. I feel India is justly represented in that way.The characters are pretty nice as I get reactions from the acting. I feel like laughing in the right spots, I feel terrified or hurt correctly and get very powerful moments in many spots be it good or bad moments. The way the flashbacks explain both Jamal's life and the answer to MOST OF THE QUESTIONS, was pretty well done, it was an engaging story and pretty interesting to see how someone of low (sorry) education learns interesting trvia.How the movie played out, mostly was interesting and pleasant to view(minus the issues discussed below) and I felt it was a good two hours. It was a movie that made me feel good, reminds me of the older movies where everyone works out in a good way and you have a love story that, although doesn't have much behind it, you know will work and you enjoy.Now problems with the movie... I have been pointed out many legit problems and remembering the movie I have to agree with some. First it is possible to argue most of the plot is contrived and most stuff happens only because it needs to (though I THINK you can say that for most fiction book/movie/tv). Some flashbacks don't provide the answer to the questions, and some questions are edited out. The studio side's opinion is not shown well and Jamal gets brought back without any real conclusion reached (unless the host or producers just decided to believe him without seeing him talk to them). Also I've heard the argument that maybe Jamal shouldn't have won as since Latika is free, their love would've been enough for them. Some ways I think it would've been better others I don't.So I still like the movie, but regonize problems with it and wish bitts could be added to solve them. And as the beginning stated, the reasons I like it, only work for me and can just as easily have not worked for haters of this film.

Don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoyed this film, but I did find some of it's premises to be strectching it in terms of reality and believability.The acting, by all players young, old and not-so-old, is highly commendable, especially some of the younger talent, which I have learned had little to no acting experience. The story, although a little too unrealistic in some parts, is well-written and told with a sort-of ""flashback"" methodology which I found to be different and refreshing. The ending, although a bit sappy, is uplifting. I was sooooo thankful that they saved the big ""dance number"" for the credits (I know it's the ""in"" thing to do in Bollywood, but in this film it would have seemed completely silly and ruined the feel of the whole thing).All in all, a VERY good film, but to me, it shouldn't have been picture of the year.

1226315,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B001P9KR8U,RMurray847,"[3, 5]","Danny  Boyle is a filmmaker who crafts strong works of cinema.  What I mean by that is that his films don't just feature good acting, or fun scripts, or terrific pacing...but they make you feel quite clearly that the experience you've  just had is one you can only get by seeing a movie.Let me illustrate in an obvious manner:  The recent film DOUBT is based on a play.  In seeing the film, I can also imagine seeing the stage show and probably not feeling greatly different about it.  It might be a good movie, but I don't feel it is IMPORTANT to have been told as a film.Danny Boyle's best works (my favorites include TRAINSPOTTING, MILLIONS & 28 DAYS LATER) use EVERYTHING film has to offer.  Editing, composition, music and even variations in film stock and color saturation.  He tells his stories through all the elements that go into filmmaking...nothing is left to just sort of happen by itself.  And he also understands that film can TELL A STORY AT A MORE BLISTERING PACE THAN ANY OTHER MEDIA.  A book might be described as a ""fast read,"" but are we individually really capable of reading faster for one book or another?  A play might be ""fast paced"" but it is still padded with scene-changes and perhaps even an intermission.  TV can come close (if you have a channel without commercials), but unless you're watching it with a theatre-sized crowd...you don't get the group viewing experience that Boyle somehow knows how to play to.His films are not perfect.  His blistering pace sometimes allows for some, frankly, sloppy performances or difficult to understand framing or editing.  His movies often have actors/characters with HEAVY accents, which can take a bit of attuning to.So having blathered on for so long, we come at last to SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE.  This is probably Boyle's best film.  It has him at the top of his powers and a story that is truly fascinating and involving.  It also features the weaknesses of the past.It's the story of two brothers, Jamal & Salim, living in a VERY poor neighborhood in Mumbai, India.  At a young age, they lose their mother, and thus spend some time in an orphanage (naturally one with a proprietor who DOESN'T have the best interests of his charges at heart).  They also spend most of their teen years living on the streets by their wits.  And then they become young adults and begin to make their ways in society.  Along the way, they are occasionally joined in their misadventures by Latika, a lovely young girl with whom Jamal falls more or less immediately in love, and the feelings might be mutual.But the film is FAR, FAR from linear.  We open with the adult Jamal being tortured by two policemen.  Why?  Because Jamal is doing EXTREMELY well on India's version of WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE.  How could a  poor, young ""kid"" from the slums know so much?  He must be cheating.  But Jamal is able to explain to the police exactly why he knows each answer...because each answer took him back to a place in his past.  And as Jamal explains, we see the story of his life unfold.  It's a device so different and so clever as to bring a smile to my face.Jamal and Salim led a very difficult life, and their personalities grew very much different.  Salim, the older brother, clearly bore the burdens of taking care of his brother with some difficulty, and he grows in his resentment of Jamal as he grows in his brutality.  Life has forced him to make some violent choices, and those actions have scarred him.  Jamal, as a young boy, is prankish and full of life, but grows to be somewhat passive.  He is smart though, and sees everything around him.  But what really gives his life meaning is the yearning to be with Latika.  He has almost infinite patience.  And when you see WHY he really went on MILLIONAIRE, you'll be touched.  It isn't just to win some money.The three main characters are played by 3 different actors...children, teens, young adults.  The younger performers are excellent and thoroughly convincing.  The scenes of their childhood are brutal, funny, painful & even tender.  It's hard to believe India is a ""modern"" country when watching some of the early scenes of life in the slums.  Squalor has never seemed more squalid on film.  Boyle, using super-saturated film stock, practically makes the smell of the place come through the screen (which is scary indeed when a key early scene takes place in a public outhouse!).How the lives of these three parallel, diverge, intersect and eventually achieve uneasy understanding is the heart of this film.  But Boyle also shows us that Mumbai (and the people of India) may be squalid, crowded & noisy but is also beautiful, vibrant and musical.  His editing, cinematography and soundtrack practically burst off the screen.  (And his recreation of MILLIONAIRE is pretty spot-on as well.)In the center of the delightfully palpable story, a story that is both completely believable and charmingly magical, is Dev Patel, the young actor who plays the grown-up Jamal.  And while I understand that Jamal doesn't really come to life unless he's with his beloved Latika...Patel plays Jamal so anemically in so many scenes that he actually comes across as a little dullwitted...which is NOT how the younger versions of Jamal come across.  I have read a lot of reviews that fawn over this young man, but to me, he was the big flaw in Boyle's film.The other flaw is the very breathless pacing that makes the film so energetic and immediate.  I sometimes wished, especially in early scenes, that Boyle has been able to slow down a little and give us a little background.  The film assumes we understand the socio/religious/political undercurrents that ran through India society...but I'm not really up on my history of India in the `80s/'90s.  I was left to speculate and fill in some blanks.But while Patel's performance didn't move me as much as another performer's might have, I still  had myself one heck of a good time.  And to top it all off, the final scene (playing beneath the closing credits) and feature Patel and the radiant Freda Pinto (Latika) in easily the most joyous...heck, darn near perfect...closing credits I've ever seen.  It's worth seeing the whole movie for that scene alone...and the movie is quite a wonderful ride itself.",5,"Joyful, vibrant and UNIQUELY cinematic.

1226316,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B001P9KR8U,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[3, 6]","Slumdog Millionaire (Danny Boyle, 2008)It's taken me quite a while since I saw this movie to get around to reviewing it, mostly because I really have no idea how I felt about it. Yes, I was uplifted, blah blah blah, but while I was watching the movie, I realized I was being manipulated, which bothered me. I'm used to needing to suspend disbelief when watching movies, but this one tosses belief right out the window from the first moment and never comes back to it. For all that I know that, however, it's an enjoyable enough movie.In case anyone actually managed to miss the plot of the 2008 Oscar winner for Best Picture, it involves a young man, Jamal Malik (Dev Patel), who ends up on the Indian version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?.  As the host asks him questions, we see flashbacks to pieces of his life (amazingly, in chronological order!) that give him the answers. Boyle uses this to take us on a tour of Mumbai slum life, the state of gang warfare in India, a romantic subplot, and much much more.As long as you don't mind being herded into the pen like cattle, or don't notice, this is just about the perfect movie; it took home eight Oscars, and as I write this is sitting at #64 on IMDB's Top 250. Heady stuff indeed, but I still find myself unimpressed with the complete lack of subtlety to be found in the script. Granted, everyone involved did a bang-up job of bringing that script to life, but the script itself left a lot to be desired. It's shameless in everything it tries to do, but it garnered a whole lot of true believers, both behind and in front of the cameras.

Or should I say, Bollywood - for the plot takes its basic structure from countless Bollywood movies, with two brothers, one ""good"" and one ""bad"", a beautiful girl caught in the middle, and truly hideous villains - yet, reportedly, it has not been a hit in India itself, possibly through being implicitly critical of harsh realities.  The use of the game show to structure specific plot points is contrived, but works fantastically well.  The characters, again much like in an action film, are charismatic without suggesting too much inner complexity, and this suits the wild visual and auditory ride that constitutes the film's prime appeal.For someone like me only distantly acquainted with Indian film and culture, this was a totally unexpected blast of melodrama and social commentary.

1226319,A16QODENBJVUI1,B001P9KR8U,Robert Moore,"[0, 3]","Warning! Minor spoilers can be found in this review!Although I've seen some really good movies this year, I can say with confidence that SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE is the one that I've enjoyed most. It has already generated perhaps the best critical reviews of any film released in 2008 and has won audience awards at notable film festivals. The film completely lives up to the hype that has surrounded it.In the first couple of minutes of the film we learn several things. First, Jamal, a Muslim who is a product of the slums, is a participant on the Indian version of WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE? Second, he is suspected of cheating and is subjected to horrific torture at the hands of the police. Gradually, after having failed to elicit confessions of how he had cheated, Jamal related, while they all watch a video of his television appearance, how he knew the answers of each of the questions. The result is a series of flashbacks that essentially tell the story of Jamal's life and his relations with the two most important relationships in his life, that of his street smart but sometimes amoral brother Salim, and Latika. These scenes are set in some of the most horrific squalor that one can imagine. It may seem unrealistic that someone could come out of such wretched life experiences as relatively unscarred as Jamal appears to be, but that is in part because at heart the film is a fairy tale. It is not an expose of the abuses of modern economic life. At heart it is a love story.I am not a big fan of director Danny Boyle, not having enjoyed at all 28 DAYS or TRAINSPOTTING or his other efforts, but his work here is nothing short of miraculous. I knew none of the cast, though I've read that several members are well known Bollywood actors. This film, I have to hasten to add, has nothing in common with a Bollywood film apart from some of the actors. Though filmed in India, this is every bit a Western film. There are many marvelous performances, not least Dev Patel as Jamal. There are a number of child actors who turn in remarkable performances. And as the grown up Latika, the newcomer Freida Pinto is fascinating to look at with her almost surreal beauty.As I said, despite the squalid settings for much of the film, this is a fairy tale, a love story. But even knowing that the film ends as a fairy tale does not prepare one for the particulars. There were a number of ways that it might have ended and while the ending wasn't completely unexpected, it wasn't entirely predictable.

1226322,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B001P9KR8U,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 2]","Winner of eight Academy Awards, including one for Best Picture of 2008, ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is like a Charles Dickens story updated to the techno-savvy 21st Century.  The movie focuses on a trio of impoverished orphans living and loving and contending with a slew of heartless villains in the slums of Mumbai, India.  Jamal, his older brother, Salim, and their compatriot, Latika, a young girl they take under their wing, undergo enormous trials and tribulations as they struggle to survive in a world that has pretty much abandoned them to the vagaries of fate.  In true Dickensian fashion, the story also provides generous doses of melodrama, implausible coincidences, hairbreadth escapes and heart-tugging sentimentality to help mitigate the suffering.Based on the novel ""Q & A"" by Vikas Swarup, the movie starts off with a now 18-year-old Jamal being interrogated - and, indeed, tortured - by the Indian authorities who don't believe that an ordinary kid from the slums could be racking up this much money as a contestant on ""Who Wants to Be A Millionaire?"" (he's fast approaching the 20,000,000 rupee mark) without somehow cheating.  With this unlikely but clever narrative device serving as a framework, the movie then travels back in time to show the skeptical police investigator just how it is that Jamal does indeed happen to know the answers to all those questions.Written by Simon Beaufoy and co-directed by Loveleen Tandan and Danny Boyle (""Trainspotting,"" ""28 Days Later""), ""Slumdog Millionaire"" somehow manages to push the envelope in the areas of plausibility and credibility without sacrificing its authenticity in the process. One moment it may be being brutally honest in its depiction of the effects of grinding poverty and cruelty on the human body and spirit - and the next be indulging in the veriest of feel-good fantasies, as Jamal stands on the brink of the ultimate rags-to-riches fable, getting both the money and the girl, in the best Horatio Algers tradition.  Yet, the movie never feels exploitative or compromised as a result of this dichotomy - a dichotomy, in fact, that clearly reflects the Indian culture of both wealth and poverty, traditionalism and modernity from which the story arises.The flashiness of the editing and the liveliness of the directing keep the film hurtling ahead at a breakneck pace, while the cast of mainly amateur actors - playing the children at various ages - engages our sympathy from the outset.  Dev Patel and the gorgeous Freida Pinto are both splendid as the oldest incarnations of the two main characters.  And don't step out before the closing credits, a fun and lively bit of Bollywood hoopla designed to send audiences out of the theater with a spring in their steps and a smile on their faces - a smile that is well and honestly earned, I must say.",4,enjoyable if occasonally outlandish melodrama,1244937600,"06 14, 2009",2009,2823,"['Winner', 'eight', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'including', 'one', 'Best', 'Picture', '2008', 'Slumdog', 'Millionaire', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'story', 'updated', 'techno-savvy', '21st', 'Century', 'movie', 'trio', 'impoverished', 'orphans', 'living', 'loving', 'contending', 'slew', 'heartless', 'villains', 'slums', 'Mumbai', 'India', 'Jamal', 'older', 'brother', 'Salim', 'compatriot', 'Latika', 'young', 'girl', 'take', 'wing', 'undergo', 'enormous', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'struggle', 'survive', 'world', 'pretty', 'much', 'abandoned', 'vagaries', 'fate', 'true', 'Dickensian', 'fashion', 'story', 'also', 'generous', 'doses', 'melodrama', 'implausible', 'coincidences', 'hairbreadth', 'escapes', 'heart-tugging', 'sentimentality', 'help', 'mitigate', 'suffering.Based', 'novel', 'Q', 'A', 'Vikas', 'Swarup', 'movie', 'now', '18-year-old', 'Jamal', 'being', 'interrogated', 'indeed', 'tortured', 'Indian', 'authorities', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'ordinary', 'kid', 'slums', 'could', 'be', 'racking', 'up', 'much', 'money', 'contestant', 'Who', 'Be', 'A', 'Millionaire', 'fast', 'approaching', '20,000,000', 'rupee', 'mark', 'somehow', 'cheating', 'unlikely', 'clever', 'narrative', 'device', 'serving', 'framework', 'movie', 'then', 'back', 'time', 'show', 'skeptical', 'police', 'investigator', 'just', 'how', 'Jamal', 'indeed', 'happen', 'know', 'answers', 'questions.Written', 'Simon', 'Beaufoy', 'co-directed', 'Loveleen', 'Tandan', 'Danny', 'Boyle', 'Trainspotting', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'Slumdog', 'Millionaire', 'somehow', 'push', 'envelope', 'areas', 'plausibility', 'credibility', 'sacrificing', 'authenticity', 'process', 'One', 'moment', 'may', 'be', 'being', 'brutally', 'honest', 'depiction', 'effects', 'grinding', 'poverty', 'cruelty', 'human', 'body', 'spirit', 'next', 'be', 'indulging', 'veriest', 'feel-good', 'fantasies', 'Jamal', 'brink', 'ultimate', 'rags-to-riches', 'fable', 'getting', 'money', 'girl', 'best', 'Horatio', 'Algers', 'tradition', 'movie', 'never', 'exploitative', 'compromised', 'result', 'dichotomy', 'dichotomy', 'fact', 'clearly', 'Indian', 'culture', 'wealth', 'poverty', 'traditionalism', 'modernity', 'story', 'arises.The', 'flashiness', 'editing', 'liveliness', 'directing', 'keep', 'film', 'hurtling', 'ahead', 'breakneck', 'pace', 'cast', 'mainly', 'amateur', 'actors', 'playing', 'children', 'various', 'ages', 'sympathy', 'outset', 'Dev', 'Patel', 'gorgeous', 'Freida', 'Pinto', 'are', 'splendid', 'oldest', 'incarnations', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'step', 'out', 'closing', 'credits', 'fun', 'lively', 'bit', 'Bollywood', 'hoopla', 'designed', 'send', 'audiences', 'theater', 'spring', 'steps', 'smile', 'smile', 'well', 'honestly', 'earned', 'must', 'say']",N/A

Slumdog (I'm just going to refer to it as simply ""Slumdog"" is the story of Jamal, a teen from the slums of Mumbai and how he became a winning contestant of India's version of ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?"" . . . The movie consists of flashback after flashback that reveals Jamal's lifestory along with revealing how Jamal knew the answers to the questions asked.The Movie was rated R and it was rated R for a reason . . Here's why:1) Language . . .There's a considerable amount of cussing2) Violence . . . While at times the violence was almost distasteful, it was vital to the plot . . Boyle (the Director) took a almost political stand point in showing the corruptness the roamed the streets of India (namely Mumbai [previously known as Bombay]) . . .There were gang affairs, murderous acts, disfiguration (of a child nonetheless!), a massacre, and sexual abuse [and abuse in general] (if any of those topics bother you intensely I wouldn't see this movie, but remember it's just a movie . . It's NOT real)3) Prostitution is an issue that's also covered in SlumdogH'okay I like Slumdog and rated it as 4 stars because:1) The acting was excellent . . . I never heard of any of these actors before and I think that's what makes it all the more special . . . In my opinion it makes you less biased if you don't know who the actors/actresses are because you can't automatically like a movie because it has whatshisface in or or automatically dislike the movie because whathisface is in it . . . It's weird how some people get really emotionally involved with their most/least favorite actors/actresses . .2)It has a message unlike all those stupid teen movies (which sometime can be entertaining but not in an artistic sense . . . I see Slumdog as a piece of art). Sure the main message is sort of corny: Love conquers all yada-yada . . .but be sure to note the other messages (some political) as well . . .3) The Music - I'm such a sucker for M.I.A.'s ""Paper Planes"" and the more traditional Indian music was good tooThings that I didn't like Slumdog (aka why I took off a star):1) It ruined my image of India . . sort of .  . I always knew there was a lot of poverty there, but I still wanted to go visit sometime . . . I'm not sure if I want to anymore . .2) The movie made me very tense .  . . I was a bit uncomfortable throughout most of the movie . . But then again, it doesn't take a lot to make me tense . . .

It uses the program 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire' as a metaphor to tell the life of an Indian boy born into the shantytowns of Mumbai.The film does a good job in portraying the poverty of these places, although some who know of this poverty may say it does not go far enough. However, even in this poverty the film provides a moment of emotional power where you are horrified, shocked but also hilariously amused when the boy meets his Bollywood actor idol.There are also disturbing scenes where the boy, his brother and their friend are duped by a 'professional begging outfit'. If you ever see street children/adults in the Indian subcontinent again, you will never look on them in the same light.The film also provides a wider critique of how these people are looked upon by the richer/more powerful classes. It also provides a powerful critique of 'modern India' which the trio inevitably get swept up in. Modern India seems to be more about superficial appearances rather than true development.The film looks at India's class prejudices, communal violence, poverty and alleged modernisation. Some Indians, who are very patriotic, despise this film because of it. This is a shame because the film could be used as a springboard for the discussion of these issues. The film is not patronising to India, nor does it preach and it certainly does not practise escapism.For me, the childhood actors really were the stars of the film. They did a fantastic job of maintaining their childhood exuberance despite all that was going on around them.Ultimately, the film has a happy ending, but you may feel this happiness is tainted by what has gone on prior to that point.p.s. I hope the child actors in this film are given a real opportunity to escape the poverty that they have come from, or otherwise the film makers are just as bad as those they portray in the film. From what I have read, they have not really made an attempt to bring the children out of poverty.

Danny Boyle's narration moves too fast to explore and further develop the characters. As a result, there is a bit of a superficial sheen that gleams that merely fixes the film as a lighthearted and breezy, though occasionally exhilarating, great novelty. Indeed, it is a crowd-pleaser, but the tragedies, daunting they may be, seem underplayed, so our rooting for the underdog seems a bit manufactured, and thus, undeserved, and his happy ending seems contrived. On the other hand, Boyle's overall unshaken optimism and idealistic fairy tale sensibilities take control of how this film is perceived: a glass half full. It is through his unwavering positive philosophy which propagates that everything is going to work out in the end that anchors this work by unpretentiously using the old-fashioned way of telling a story: to simply tell a story, and indeed reading it as a fairy tale book. So by virtue of doing this, ""Slumdog Millionare"" succeeds as a fairy tale, and it is a grandly entertaining one at that, with a highly positive and singing ending to boot.

It never fails to choke me up by the end. My favourite part, after they reunite in the end, is the Bollywood dance to ""Jai Ho"".The cinematography in this film is so unique and I really enjoyed it.

This is one of them, and quite an unlikely entry from Danny Boyle in that we see a simple love story.  Up till now, Mr. Boyle hasn't gone for the cheaply sentimental, and while there are plenty of opportunities to go in that direction with ""Slumdog,"" it never gets too treacly.How he does that is the conceat of the storytelling.  Split between Jamal's gritty backstory of a childhood in the the slums of Mumbai is the glitzy tension of him compeating in the Indian version of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?""  A rags to riches story this is, but Jamal has come up from the absolute bottom to the very top of winning it all, and stays basically a good guy motivated by the right things.  Namely the love of his life whom he's known since childhood.  Boyle takes an unflinching look at life in the slums of India's megacities, and this keeps us grounded.  The youngsters picked to play the characters as children have great heart, which can be pretty heartbraking when you see how they keep their innocence in such dark surroundings.  Some Indian citizens claim the depiction of Mumbai is too negative, but this can be a good thing in showing one's country as well.  After all, we can see the good touristy things in a travelogue.  We can experience a country by seeing all sides of it.Boyle even throws an homage to the musical numbers common in the the Hindi/Marsala Bollywood productions in the end credits.

1226332,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B001P9KR8U,Scott Schiefelbein,"[4, 5]","Danny Boyle's ""Slumdog Millionaire"" has been described as ""Dickensian,"" and there may be no better description of this heartbreaking, funny, riveting tale of three young kids from the slums of Mumbai.Much of the story's strength comes from its willingness to throw the viewer into a world that is completely alien to most Americans - the slums of Mumbai.  These ramshackle tin roof warrens are home to hundreds of thousands of people, each with their own stories, tragedies, and triumphs.  Like ""City of God,"" which ripped aside the veil to show the horrific slums just outside of the paradise of Rio, ""Slumdog"" shows the squalor that can be found side-by-side with such romantic icons as the Taj Mahal.I saw ""Slumdog"" after all the awards and accolades, and I was worried.  Could it possibly live up to the hype?  I knew that one of the characters, Jamal (played in teen version by Dev Patel, in youth by other actors) would end up on the Indian version of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,"" and that he had the hots for a gorgeous gal, Latika (teen version, Freida Pinto).  Would this movie strike me as flat as ""Juno,"" another movie I didn't see until dozens of people had told me that ""you have to see this"" (turns out, no I didn't).  Or would this be like ""Sideways,"" a movie that charmed me out of my socks even though everyone seemingly had raved about it?The great news is that ""Slumdog"" is another ""Sideways"" in that regard.Using the structure of the increasing dollar amounts of ""Millionaire,"" ""Slumdog"" tells the story of three kids as they try to make their way in a harsh, bleak world that chews up and spits out kids like so many cherry pits.  No spoilers here - just prepare to be shocked at the horrors these kids face with so much aplomb as well as the snatches of beauty and humanity these kids find along the way.  Not as harsh as ""City of God"" by any means, ""Slumdog"" nevertheless contains more than its share of powerful scenes that will haunt you.All in all, an excellent film.",5,"Familiar yet surprising tale of love, friendship, and abject poverty",1254528000,"10 3, 2009",2009,1997,"['Danny', 'Boyle', 'Slumdog', 'Millionaire', 'been', 'described', 'Dickensian', 'may', 'be', 'better', 'description', 'heartbreaking', 'funny', 'riveting', 'tale', 'three', 'young', 'kids', 'slums', 'Mumbai.Much', 'story', 'strength', 'willingness', 'throw', 'viewer', 'world', 'completely', 'alien', 'most', 'Americans', 'slums', 'Mumbai', 'ramshackle', 'tin', 'roof', 'warrens', 'are', 'home', 'hundreds', 'thousands', 'people', 'own', 'stories', 'tragedies', 'triumphs', 'City', 'God', 'ripped', 'veil', 'show', 'horrific', 'slums', 'just', 'paradise', 'Rio', 'Slumdog', 'squalor', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'side-by-side', 'such', 'romantic', 'icons', 'Taj', 'Mahal.I', 'saw', 'Slumdog', 'awards', 'accolades', 'was', 'worried', 'Could', 'possibly', 'live', 'up', 'hype', 'knew', 'one', 'characters', 'Jamal', 'played', 'teen', 'version', 'Dev', 'Patel', 'youth', 'other', 'actors', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'Indian', 'version', 'Who', 'Be', 'Millionaire', 'had', 'hots', 'gorgeous', 'gal', 'Latika', 'teen', 'version', 'Freida', 'Pinto', 'Would', 'movie', 'strike', 'as', 'flat', 'Juno', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'dozens', 'people', 'had', 'told', 'have', 'see', 'out', 'did', ""n't"", 'would', 'be', 'Sideways', 'movie', 'charmed', 'socks', 'even', 'everyone', 'seemingly', 'had', 'raved', 'great', 'news', 'Slumdog', 'Sideways', 'regard.Using', 'structure', 'increasing', 'dollar', 'amounts', 'Millionaire', 'Slumdog', 'story', 'three', 'kids', 'try', 'make', 'way', 'harsh', 'bleak', 'world', 'up', 'out', 'kids', 'so', 'many', 'cherry', 'pits', 'spoilers', 'here', 'just', 'prepare', 'be', 'shocked', 'horrors', 'kids', 'face', 'so', 'much', 'aplomb', 'as', 'well', 'snatches', 'beauty', 'humanity', 'kids', 'find', 'way', 'Not', 'as', 'harsh', 'City', 'God', 'means', 'Slumdog', 'nevertheless', 'more', 'share', 'powerful', 'scenes', 'will', 'haunt', 'you.All', 'excellent', 'film']",N/A

Bhansali's 2-star review in large part. Slumdog really isn't about India or even poor people. It's about the transformative of power cinematic illusions. But so what?**spoiler alert**To see how manipulative this film is consider the following question: how would the film have been different if Jamal's mother did not die? Answer: the only consequence is that he would not have known the answer to a game show question.I'm not joking. That is the only discernable difference. Jamal's mother is beaten to death in a pogrom and this influences Jamal's psyche in no apparent way. Later in the film, Jamal's girlfriend (Latika) is raped by Jamal's brother. Again, Latika seems to suffer no ill effects from this sexual assault.How are the children of the slums able to overcome such trauma? What is their source of inner strength? We never find out because Slumdog makes it very clear that the events it depicts are mere plot devices. They don't represent real events. The mother really didn't die; the girl really wasn't raped. It's all fake. It's just a movi about a game show. There will be Bollywood ending--complete with a little Bollywood dance--just in case you had any doubts about the complete unreality of what you just saw. Memories of children being orphaned, mutilated, sexually assaulted and sold into slavery are all erased in the blinding light of Latika's model-perfect (but entirely vacant) smile. Hey, that's cool. Why not? After all, it's just a movie.This sort of nonsense comes off rather badly when compared to the brilliant film Salaam Bombay! The street kids in Salaam Bombay! face the same tragidies the kids in Slumdog face. But Salaam Bombay! demonstrates that these stark circumstances are bearable because the children of the slums have individual worth. The urchins speak and have real motivations (compare this to Latika or the one-eyed urchin). The children of Salaam Bombay! survive their suffering because they create dignity within that suffering. At no time does Salaam Bombay suggest that the main character's suffering is illusory or can be easily forgotten if he can just find a beautiful Bollywood girlfriend.I don't deny that Slumdog is at times enjoyable. It's reasonably well acted and entertaining. But that is part of the problem.

1226336,A1L8HRCM60W0W7,B001P9KR8U,Shashank Tripathi,"[4, 5]","Frantic and pitiless, profane yet eloquent, flush with the ability to create laughter out of unspeakable situations, Slumdog Millionaire takes its simple message--what doesn't kill you yields the most lasting education--and weaves a riveting masterpiece about the life of a boy who makes it in a world of delicious contradictions.This is trademark Danny Boyle stuff (of ""Trainspotting"" and ""The Beach"" fame). His stunners have left no doubt that he can poke into a subculture and emerge with a fresh new look at it. But Slumdog goes one better. It is pitch-perfect in its take, but also perhaps his most accessible endeavor thus far.The narrative couches a crisp homage to Bollywood. Funky A.R.Rehman music. A largely Indian crew. Crisp acting, even from kids, in fact especially from kids. And then the gloriously larger-than-life thematic flourishes: poor folks at the behest of a cruel world, friend pitted against friend, brother against brother--and the most tried and tested one of all-- a rags to riches cavalcade of an underprivileged hero who makes it amid impossible odds. It's hero-giri alright.But where it departs from Bollywood is Simon Beaufoy's screenplay. It's dazzling. Professional Indian reviewers have been overly delicate in their reference to Vikas Swarup's novel that inspired the film, ""Q & A"". The book was an enjoyable read, but the film merely borrows the central premise and that's basically it. There is a scene towards the end with our two protagonists at a train station where a trick of reverse cutting will tell a discerning viewer just how innovative the thinking behind the screenplay truly is--that is such a sweet, affectionate shot that it moistened my eyes.It's a bummer that such fuss and to-do has been made about how this film projects an unfair image of the country. Guess the confusion arises when established reviewers such as Roger Ebert decide to call it a testament to ""the real India"". I wouldn't be so pedantic. To me, the film carries no such delusions of grand purpose. It's a gleeful entertainer. A breakneck story of one individual from *one* aspect of an astonishingly multifaceted country. To that extent, it covers its subject with addicting vigor and focus. It's witty, gritty, and--for suitable values thereof--sh*tty.To address some petty cavils:(1) The use of English by the characters. It's a British production, what did you expect. There's a world outside a specific country. We call it ""International Cinema"". Bet there will be local dubbed versions for those who truly desire it that way (now that the film's multitude of nominations have drawn it far away from a SlumUnderdog status).(2) The disrespectful use of the word ""dog"" in the title. This smacks of nothing but ignorance of colloquialisms. ""Word up, dawg"", for instance? People forget that an insult becomes an insult only when we choose to let it become one.(3) Finally, the unfairness of how it depicts India in a manner that might give people the WrongIdea. To these Einsteins may I point out that the baffling kaleidoscope we call India makes it pretty hard to ever get the RightIdea to begin with?What level of dimness would make a viewer go seeking a wholesome view of a country in *one* film? Just because ""The Godfather"" showed with such pizzazz one specific aspect of the American underworld, should we infer that every American is a gun-slinging gangster? ""Crouching Tiger.."" may have sketched a mellifluous perspective of China, but I don't recall anyone thinking that our Chinese colleagues fly from tree to tree on their way to work. And so on.It's a movie, not a national treatise. Sure, it depicts poverty. So? Those who have expanded their horizons beyond Spiderman Part 38 will know that countless movies have been made in the last decade alone that depict hard times in *every* country. At any rate, reality is nothing but a collectively accepted notion. I'd say Slumdog is as equidistant from reality as, say, Bollywood's gigantic palaces (yeah, we live that way) or the scantily-clad ""item girls"" gyrating on snow-capped mountains.To people who have yet to see this upbeat thriller: ignore all the Pavlovian drivel.

I just knew it had swept the awards season, and I had a great respect for Danny Boyle, as a director. The film was, in turn, amazing, horrifying, romantic, beautifully photographed, engaging, and satisfying. What I do not understand are people who found it cliched or formulaic. There is nothing ordinary about ""Slumdog Millionaire"". The use of flashbacks to explain how Jamal knew the answers to the difficult questions was brilliant. Not that flashbacks are new territory; it is how they were used that is intriguing. How hardened do people have to be not to feel swept up into the emotions of the children in the slums of Mumbai? Are people that ignorant of what life is like in India? Danny Boyle just showed you what life was like for a certain caste of people, and some people still cannot see it. There are slums and abject poverty and beggars and orphans and thieves and human traffickers. I found a lot of this unsettling, but I can face the truth. Why is it easier to watch a teen slasher film than the truth about a real country? Danny Boyle and Simon Beaufoy, the screenwriter, as well as all the wonderful actors, have created a masterpiece.

Since I am originally from India so, I am aware of most of what is shown in the movie. So this might have taken away some of the impact that Boyle tries to deliver.Is the movie Oscar worthy? I would say, it deserved oscars for 7 out of the 8 categories except for best picture(which I thought The reader should have won).Danny Boyle has done a wonderful job in directing this movie and has captured a slice of India very well. The screenplay and the writing is terrific and the scenes seamlessly fit in the plot. Some people feel that he has wrongly portrayed India as a poor country. But as a film maker he has a right to choose a segment of India and make a movie about it. Yes, what you see only part of Indian life.India is a country where there are palaces and slums side by side. When someone makes a movie about King kakaka with lavishing palaces etc, no one would complain about the movie wrongly portraying India as such a rich country.A.R.Rahman has done a wonderful job, as usual. A lot of people feel that this is not his best work and he has done better. But we are talking about the original score here and NOT the actual songs. The score certainly delivered the knock out punch and had a tremendous impact throughout the movie. As far as the best song goes, yes Rahman has done better. But ""Jai ho"" was the perfect feel good song to finish off the climax. The academy was definitely unjust towards Bruce Springsteen for not nominating the song from ""The Wrestler"". Among the nominations ""Jai ho"" certainly deserved the honor.Dev Patel, Freida Pinto, Irfan Khan and Anil Kapoor have done a good job but nothing spectacular.

It is told in flash backs, with each part of his life history linked to the question being asked on the gameshow. This is a novel way of progressing both stories and explained his motivation to be on the show in the first place. This film was marketed in the trailers as quite a light hearted affair, but in reality it is quite dark in places and very gritty. It shows the harsh life of those born into the slums of India and although it has the rags to riches element to it, you are also shown the more ugly side of a life of poverty. I thought the film was all the better for this and it made for a film with greater weight and depth. Everyone plays their roles very well and the acting is good from child and adult cast alike and the direction is as good as Boyle is renowned for. There is also an excellent Bollywood dance scene at the end credits which made for a delightful way to end the film.

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[2, 6]","I did not see this Academy Award winning ""darling"" in the theatres last year so I can only review it based on the DVD version (not Blu-ray). From all the press and the awards it won, it became known as the Indian ""Rocky"". The ""little film that could"".I watched the DVD on a moderately large TV screen and from the first few moments had a trouble with the subtitles. Unlike the usual ""bottom of the screen"" titles, Director Danny Boyle gets ""cutesy"" and has them appear at various places on the screen. Sometime upper right; sometimes left center. And they are not only in smaller print than most subtitles but they appear in colored boxes. Sort of reminds me of those ""trivia bits"" that some nostalgia films add. Now the film is MOSTLY in English but there are large portions in the first half that are in Hindi and need translation to know what is being said. This was enough to drop a full star off my rating. I'm not sure how this all came across in the theatres. Your eyes need to scan the screen, as you never know where the subtitle will appear. (Question: Is it still a ""subtitle"" when it appears in the upper right part of the screen?)The other thing that got me about the film is the amazing amount of violence. There is a lot of graphic violence going on here and definitely not for kids. The major emotional moments at the end of the film - both the ""will he get the Ru 20,000,000 answer right?"" one and the ""will the lovers finally get together?"" one - are underscored by either the ""So You Want To be a Millionaire"" theme or the crescendo building love theme.

The story is about two brothers Jamal and Salim, and their friend Latika, who are played by three teams of actors, roughly aged five, 12 and 21. The film starts when Jamal is thrown into police interrogation, suspected of cheating on a 20,000,000 rupee quiz show. No one can understand how a street kid could get so many questions right, but somehow he does. Through flashback, we understand how he does it. And the police, never having encountered someone so truthful, cannot keep him in the cell any longer. And so he goes back to the TV studios to play the final round.Of course, the question of luck is a bit like the story of Chance the Gardener in ""Being There"" - he never did anything other than be himself, and was immensely successful at it - but the story of young people who fought their way out of poverty and bad luck to finally make something of their lives, and to win the support of the population in so doing, is simply a tale that is hard to beat.

After all, the story of Jamal, an Indian muslim orphan from the slums, becomes a contestant on the Indian hit game show version of ""Who Wants to Be A Millionaire?"" but for not the obvious reasons. He is treated with suspicion by authorities and even the game show host played brilliantly of Anil Kapoor, one of Bollywood's biggest stars. The young man played by three different actors at different stages seamingly blend into one character of Jamal Patel as his brother and another female orphan. With each question, Jamal remembers something to help him answer and that's the brilliance. When he explains his history, he comes across so natural rather than intensive. There is a lot of drama and flashbacks to his life in only 18 years. In only 2 hours, you are transformed into becoming one of his supporters and win or lose. You are rooting for him all the way to get the money and the girl. You laugh, you cry, and you will remember this film for a long time.

1226353,A256QKS1DIQ54U,B001P9KR8U,T. Bollinger,"[0, 0]","In reality, I could go on all day about the standard features of a film production that &#8216;Slumdog&#8217; excels at, be it the excellent pacing, stunning direction from Danny Boyle, the awesome and versatile score courtesy of longtime Bollywood composer A. R. Rahman, or the solid performances from Dev Patel, Freida Pinto, and Madhur Mittal, none of which were out of this world, but together formed a brilliant cast through their chemistry. I could do all that, but I won&#8217;t. Instead, I will focus on what I believe made this film work on so many levels &#8212; as a drama, a love story, and an inspirational philosophical journey.Much has been made about the love story central to &#8216;Slumdog&#8217;s story, but I would like to point out and give credit to the union of the two brothers in the script, played by Dev Patel and Madhur Mittal. While they are relatively simple underdog characters on the surface, as one of my peers pointed out, they also each represent a different philosophy on how to live one&#8217;s life. The protagonist, Jamal (Patel), embodies idealism in the sense that he strives to live his life in a true and pure way. He has clear set of morals and a code of conduct that he assigns to everyone, not just those close to him. His older brother, Salim (Mittal), is a metaphor for pragmatism, or realism. Salim is a survivor. He makes his way through life with the lone goal of self-promotion, only occasionally pausing to help those close to him. Morals are a guideline rather than a rulebook for him. Throughout the story, &#8216;Slumdog&#8217;s&#8217; script never clearly chooses which path or philosophy is the correct one. It hints that both are needed to successfully navigate through life, but beyond that, remains silent as far as philosophical preaching goes.&#8216;Slumdog Millionaire&#8217; is primarily a Cinderella story infused with philosophical contemplation of moral values. This mix of love story, underdog-against-the-odds tale, and examination of philosophy is what makes the movie work. I freely admit that multiple aspects of &#8216;Slumdog&#8217; are cliched and overused in Bollywood, Hollywood, and elsewhere in cinema. However, it is the combination, chemistry, and delivery of all these various elements that make &#8216;Slumdog Millionaire&#8217; great. The mastermind behind all that is writer, Simon Beaufoy. Another section which I briefly alluded to earlier, mostly for those who pay special attention to the technical details of films (more so than the writing or character building moments), is the editing and the direction of this picture. Critics will certainly attempt to bully SM on its believability, but there is no way in hell anyone can chastise SM when it comes to the way it was shot, and how those shots were put together in postproduction. First off, multiple scenes stand out for there slick, inventive cinematography, such as the opening slum chase scene, the night train escape scene, and the climax&#8217;s gangster shootout. Editing stands out in particular with the way the questionnaire MCTs and flashbacks are interwoven and whenever a major music ensemble forms. I could really go on all day about these two facets of filmmaking with regard to SM, however, so I&#8217;ll stop there. You get the picture.Lastly, for those people (probably mostly die-hard Bollywood fans) who watch this movie and cry foul at the less than flattering depiction of India and/or the so-called imitation of Bollywood cinema for Western audiences, you really need to get your head out of your ass. The criticism of nations in cinema is nothing new, and it&#8217;s not going away anytime soon. Condemning a movie solely on these grounds is usually insufficient, unless the holier-than-thou attitude is truly excessive. Anyway, with all the criticism of other large, powerful nations like the United States, Great Britain, China, and Russia so frequent in the motion picture industry, I&#8217;m not sure what the big deal is with &#8216;Slumdog.&#8217; I will also argue that this film does not take a low-brow, manipulative mode of self-righteousness the way films like James Cameron&#8217;s &#8216;Avatar&#8217; and Kevin Costner&#8217;s &#8216;Dances with Wolves&#8217; do. The dense, beautiful, and sometimes dangerous streets of Mumbai are the setting for this underdog epic, not the focus.And finally, those who are Bollywood veterans and look at &#8216;Slumdog Millionaire,&#8217; saying, &#8220;What&#8217;s the big deal?&#8221; I have two responses: First, read the first 6 paragraphs of this review. This movie clearly separates from Bollywood with its gritty style and veteran direction. It may walk and talk like a Bollywood hit, but it is of a different breed entirely. My second response is this: (Psuedo) Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, my friends. &#8216;Slumdog Millionaire&#8217;s success can only do good for Hindi films, acting as a bridge between Western and South Asian film audiences. That&#8217;s what happened to me, anyway.So, this picture is not really Hollywood&#8217;s and Danny Boyle&#8217;s take on Bollywood, rather, it is an experimentation of a variety of storytelling devices that chooses its home in India. It is NOT a ripoff of Hindi films. It has virtually nothing in common with them. Because of the aforementioned reasons, I argue that this is one of the few Academy Award dominations that deserved every Oscar it received.&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;SCORE: 10/10+ The cinematography is nothing short of marvelous. Danny Boyle definitely showcases some of his best camerawork here. At least four scenes in the film are so gloriously shot that they could be the centerpieces of most films, and the environments and mood of the narrative are brought to life in striking detail.+ A. R. Rahman&#8217;s score is off the charts, combining multiple genres into soundscapes that bring the emotional intensity from the scenes to the foreground with great results.+ The chemistry between the two brothers is effective and believable, making you root for both of them as the story progresses. Each brother is likable in their own way, and their dialogue is both witty and feels very genuine. Come to think of it, they should&#8217;ve got one of those younger kids to star as Anakin instead of Jake Lloyd.? It&#8217;s great to see an epic film that is both excellent AND happy by the end. Too many tragedies need to be balanced out by Cinderella stories celebrating underdog success every now and then.",5,'Slumdog Millionaire' (2008): Review,1362700800,"03 8, 2013",2013,6694,"['reality',

I knew that this film won the Oscar and many other awards but didn't know much about the plot.  It essentially is the love story of two young people and how their lives separate them and bring them back together.The way this film is shot is definately unique. The violence and brutality in the movie don't quite seem as realistic as a typical action/drama movie.

1226358,A2QR035HCPBSLC,B001P9KR8U,"The B ""ahnonamis""","[1, 2]","THE MOVIEThe story of Slumdog Millionaire is, oddly enough, something you could easily see becoming a movie. A little heralded, straight-to-DVD movie; an executive taking a chance by putting it out in theaters; that same film dominating the Academy Awards, and becoming one of the best films of the year, making a star of its young leading actor. Sounds Hollywood, doesn't it?It's odd for a movie to become so inexplicably popular, but Slumdog did it. While I did (and do) love the movie -- and consider it one of the best films of 2008 -- I have to step out on a limb here and state, on the record, that I do think the movie is overrated. Good? Yes. Great? Close. The best movie of 2008? Not quite.Still, Slumdog is a fantastic movie the first time you experience it.The story revolves around Jamal Malik, a young man from the slums of Mumbai, suddenly finding himself in the hot seat on India's version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? Inexplicably, Jamal seems to know the answers to every question. Accused of cheating, he's taken to a secure location, where the police ""interview"" him to get a confession. Of course, it turns out Jamal isn't cheating; rather, the answers to the questions come from his own life experiences. And what a life this young slumdog has led!The film plays artfully between past and present. In one moment, you'll witness Jamal being ""questioned,"" and in the next you'll witness a much younger Jamil having to find a way to survive in the world, as many poor orphans (and non-orphans) are forced to do in India's slums. Along for the ride are Jamal's older brother, Salim, and the girl he knew since childhood, Latika. Starting out as homeless, penniless, hopeless orphans, the seesawing chronological tale shows the ways life can treat a young slumdog, and Jamal and Salim play perfect foils to one another; Jamal is the boy who desires to escape and avoid a life of crime in favor of moderate living, while Salim is slowly enticed by illegal workings and the gangster lifestyle.As the film progresses, director Danny Boyle (yes, the same guy from the zombie flicks) takes us to places in India we may have seen in books, but that we've never seen before. Aside from the well weaved story, Slumdog's true charm comes from the feeling it exudes. On one hand a familiar world we can understand; on the other something so different that it may shock or disgust more sheltered viewers.Ultimately, Slumdog is one of those ""feel good"" movies that, at the end, makes you smile. Is the journey always happy? No. But, as I'm sure you'll be able to ascertain, the ending certainly leaves off on an overall happy note. There are a few problems with the narrative here and there, but overall, the story is solid, it leaves you feeling good, and there are only minor issues. The biggest issue, perhaps, is that once you've seen it, you can never see it the same way again. Some movies get better with repeat viewings -- some stay roughly the same. Slumdog Millionaire, however, is markedly lessened with each viewing. Maybe it's because, after seeing it, the strange and unfamiliar sights and culture aren't so strange and unfamiliar anymore?THE DISC- Audio and Video -One of Danny Boyle's signatures is using various types of cameras and films when shooting, resulting in scenes that look entirely unique to the rest of the movie. That strategy is employed in full force in Slumdog Millionaire, and never has it looked so good. The transfer to Blu-ray is spectacular, and near-reference quality. Colors are vivid, blacks are deep, and certain scenes look incredibly realistic. The only problem I noticed was, in some scenes, grain seemed to be a bit more present, and less an artistic use and more a technical limitation. There's also a problem with bloom in some scenes, but nothing too worrying.Those two issues are minor, and on the whole the video of Slumdog Millionaire on Blu-ray is as close to reference quality as you can get. It just misses the boat, but it's definitely one of the best looking films to come out so far this year.If the video is near-reference, the audio is above and beyond reference quality. I knew the movie (and soundtrack) sounded good when I saw it in theaters, but who knew it could sound better in my living room! Presented in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 Surround, the audio is easily the best part of this release. Surrounds are employed to a great extent, really capturing the feel of urban slums. If it has one drawback, it's that it can be too loud -- too overbearing -- at times. With all of the little sounds going on in every scene, it's easy to want to turn it up to fully hear the atmosphere. But a minute later, the bass will kick in, or some foreground sound will increase, and suddenly you'll find yourself fumbling with the remote so you don't agitate your neighbor. (Although, if you live in a city maybe you can convince them the noise is coming from outside...)- Extras -The extras include the fare you'd expect with a release like this, but little of what you'd hope to see. To start off, there's the mandatory commentaries, the main one being by Danny Boyle and Slumdog star Dev Patel. Boyle goes on and on about the making of the movie and generally covers everything with a thick layer of enthusiasm, but Patel only offers a few real interesting tidbits, likely since he's not used to this sort of thing yet.Next you have the deleted (and extended) scenes. A majority of the running time is spent extending scenes currently in the movie, but there are some worthy deleted ones that should be watched, including more fleshing out of Jamal and Salim's teenage years. Nothing that will alter how you view the picture, but worth watching for fans and non-fans alike.Then, there's my favorite, ""Slumdog Dreams,"" which is the ""making of"" of Slumdog Millionaire. It gives an interesting look at some of the challenges a Western crew faced filming in Mumbai, as well as some of the unexpected problems that arose. Not too long (at a little over 20 minutes), but entertaining and informative.In a move that may surprise many people, Slumdog Millionaire actually has Blu-ray exclusive features! One of them (""from script to screen"") is short, clcoking in at about 5 minutes, but the other is substantially longer. Unfortunately, it's a very specific piece for a very specific audience. Titled ""Manjha,"" the short black and white film (about 40 minutes running time) follows an actual slumdog through the streets of Mumbai, as he struggles to survive along with his baby sister. A fantastic story and one that must be told... But compared to the movie, a little -- make that a lot -- dark. If Slumdog made you happy and romanticize slums, then this will bring you back to earth.- Verdict -Slumdog Millionaire may not have been my favorite movie of 2008, but it's still a fantastic film. Sadly, there aren't as many extras for a Best Picture winner as I'd hope, but maybe we'll get the No Country treatment and see a special edition down the line. Until then, if you haven't seen Slumdog yet, this is by far the best way to do so. The film looks gorgeous, sounds bloody fantastic, and is a very inviting tale with enough character development to satisfy even the most jaded of critics. If you already saw it in theaters and were hoping for a few hours of extra material, I'm sad to say you'll have to keep waiting. In the meantime, still give picking this one up a thought. It may not have been my Best Picture for 2008, but so far it's easily the Best Blu of 2009.

1226359,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B001P9KR8U,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[1, 2]","Slumdog Millionaire offers an enticingly original presentation of familiar tales by utilizing a flashback system of storytelling that fuses exhilarating adventure with suspenseful drama.  Many of the scenarios created are nothing new, but the fantastical delivery and extraordinary setting undoubtedly provide a refreshing take on more traditional themes.In a series of flashbacks, Slumdog Millionaire retraces young Jamal Malik's (Dev Patel) life up to his current predicament.  He is a contestant on the Hindi version of ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire"" and, much to the chagrin of the show's producers and arrogant host Prem Kumar (Anil Kapoor), Jamal manages to reach the million dollar question.  But before he can answer, time runs out and he is brought backstage to be violently interrogated by Mumbai's thuggish police.  As Jamal explains how he knew the answer to each of the questions presented, we learn the amazing tale of the youth's turbulent childhood and his undying search for a long lost love.Slumdog's finest accomplishment lies within a unique method of flashback storytelling that perfectly complements the line of questioning presented during the game show.  As Jamal recounts his adventurous and often dangerous childhood growing up in the slums of Mumbai, we slowly learn the trials and triumphs he has faced and his ultimate reason for competing on the show.  This steady build of characters and settings creates a mesmerizing vehicle that allows the audience to easily ride along with Jamal on his tempestuous journey to face his destiny.For a cast consisting primarily of child actors and debut performances, the acting is surprisingly strong.  The three main characters are shown at several different stages in their lives and each perfectly complements their previous incarnations.  The children truly steal the show as they face the hardships of growing up in such despondent situations, yet while their innocence is lost their spirits remain unbroken, and Patel, Mittal, and Pinto admirably carry on their legacies to a fateful conclusion.Slumdog Millionaire presents a recognizably surefire love story that has been seen before. But the process in which it is used - the method of storytelling - is wholly original and genuinely entertaining. A rare setting, a coming of age flashback setup, and wonderfully developed characters make Slumdog Millionaire a winning fantasy of unyielding love.

1226362,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B001P9KR8U,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[1, 3]","""Slumdog Millionaire"", the new film from director Danny Boyle (""Trainspotting"", ""28 Days Later"") is the foreign film break out this year. There is always one. One film containing believable characters, an interesting story and great filmmaking that attracts more than the core audience of foreign film aficionados. ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is the film that will play in multiplexes across the country.Jamal (Dev Patel, BBC America's ""Skins"") is a contestant on the Hindi version of ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire"" and he is doing quite well, surprising everyone even the show's host, Prem Kumar (Anil Kapoor), an oilier version of our own Regis. Jamal reaches a very high plateau just as time runs out. Join us tomorrow as Jamal goes for the big 4 million-rupee question. As Jamal and Prem walk backstage, two cops take Jamal in and begin interrogating him. A little slum dog like him could not possibly have the intelligence or knowledge to make it this far. Doctors and professors don't make it this far. He must be cheating. Who is helping him? How is he doing it? Thus begins ""Slumdog Millionaire"", director Danny Boyle's newest creation and a film that easily erases any memory of the travesty he last perpetrated on us. (That was called ""Sunshine"" and I don't recommend it. At all. In fact, sorry to bring it up again.)As Jamal sits in the police station, the Inspector (Irrfan Khan, ""A Mighty Heart"", ""The Namesake"", ""The Darjeeling Limited"") shows a VHS tape of the show he was just on, starting with his introduction. Everyone politely applauds as Jamal enters and Prem tries to get a few personal facts out of the young man. When Jamal manages to make the audience laugh, at Prem's expense, the tides turn and Prem, always aware of his status as one of India's biggest personalities, is a bit taken back. But as he is being watched by millions of people, he laughs it off. They start with the easy questions and Jamal answers the first.For each of the questions, we revisit a part of Jamal's life, watching how he grew up in the slums, the lengths he would go to to get an autograph from one of his favorite stars, a particularly harrowing stay in an orphanage right out of a Dickens's novel and much more. We quickly get the rhythm director Boyle wants to show us. Jamal is able to answer all of these questions because he has experienced something in his life providing him with the answer. It is almost as though he is fated to appear on the show at this time, because all of the questions seem to be written for him, catering to his knowledge.The film presents an episode from Jamal's life to give us the background on how he obtained the knowledge necessary to answer the question. And as we watch these moments, most form the coherent narrative of the young man's life to this point. Early on, he becomes an orphan, living on the mean streets of Bombay with his older brother, Salim, and an orphan girl named Latika, whom they befriend and adopt. As Jamal grows up, he makes decisions that will affect his life based on Salim and Latika. In fact, early on, he develops a love for Latika, believing her to be the most beautiful woman in the world. Throughout his life, she is always on his mind and he desperately wants a reunion. Again, the fates seem to step in.As the story follows many twists and turns, Jamal, Salim and Latika end up in an orphanage where all the children are expected to sing, literally, for their supper. When they achieve a certain skill, the director of the orphanage uses a truly Dickensian method to eke more money out of the children's earnings as street performers and beggars.Jamal does not have an easy life and all of these harrowing moments are shown to us, giving us a unique portrait of what his life is like and a snapshot of the time and place.As a young man, Jamal's infatuation with Latika (Freida Pinto) knows no bounds and he tries to relocate his brother, now a well-known enforcer for a local gangster, in the hopes of locating her again. When he finds out she is the 'kept' girl of the same gangster, he decides to pay her a visit. He soon realizes he must have money, to help them both escape, and decides to appear on her favorite show, ""Who Wants to Be A Millionaire?"" He figures any money he wins will help them and his appearance will also attract her attention, proving his love and devotion. More, it will provide a sort of calling card to her, hopefully prompting her to take the next step and meet him, so they can run off together.He surprises himself when he realizes he knows most of the questions.At first, Prem is entertained by the little 'slumdog' sitting in the chair opposite him. His appearance could only help improve the already outstanding ratings of his show, and increase his already great star power. But Jamal gets over his stage fright too quickly and begins to verbally spar with the host of the popular show. Then he begins to answer many questions right.How is he able to answer questions that doctors and lawyers have failed at? Therein lies the story.Prem tries to maintain his show's reputation and the suspense by drawing things out as much as possible. When they reach a high plateau, he is happy to realize they have run out of time. The 'slumdog' will have to return tomorrow. His director and producers are thrilled, but Prem is happy to see the police take him away.Directed by Danny Boyle and Loveleen Tandan and written by Simon Beaufroy (""The Full Monty""), ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is very close to a perfect film. Boyle and his co-director weave a stunningly complex tale of three young people who start out the same and follow their lives down different paths. It is the lifelong love Jamal has for Latika that will bring them all back together in a completely rousing, believable and very romantic finale.Naturally, there are moments as terrifying as others are amusing. Yet, Boyle achieves a fine balance making them all seem believable and taking us on a journey through many emotions. One moment we might laugh at Jamal's predicament, the next cry at his misfortune. The remarkable thing about this is that Boyle manages to make everything seem natural, to flow with ease. Nothing ever seems forced or cinematic.Quite honestly, there isn't a single thing I can think of to criticize about this film. No false steps, no story holes, none of the acting sticks out for the wrong reasons. What is clear is that Boyle and his team film many scenes in India, on the crowded streets of Mumbai, in the slums, making the film all the more authentic. I know this must seem like a given, but it is difficult to control all of the elements of a film shoot on any actual city street. When you multiply the crowds and decrease the size of the streets, the job becomes all the more difficult. Yet, there are a surprising number of scenes set outside in Mumbai and in very wretched, horrible looking slums.There have been more than a few films in the last few years to use game shows as part of the story, providing a certain amount of dramatic subtext to the main character's story. Generally, these seem forced and don't really work. In ""Slumdog Millionaire"", there is a key difference; the game show host is a character in the film, involved in the story and the game show is used as a framing device to show us various key moments in Jamal's life. This technique is so much more inherently engaging it makes all the difference in the world.Even the overly romantic nature of the climax seems well earned by the viewer and fits with the rest of the story.Boyle is a very good filmmaker who takes his time and seeks out the right projects. When he finds the right project, because there have been missteps (""Sunshine"", ""A Life Less Ordinary""), he knocks them out of the ballpark.",5,"You'll Feel All the More Rich for Having Seen this

Jamal Malik (Dev Patel), an 18 year-old orphan, has lived the hard-knock life, so that when he gets to each question posed by the slimy narcissistic host (Anil Kappor), there was some tragedy in his life to illuminate the answer.""Slumdog Millionaire"" highlights the cavernous divide between India's nouveau riche and it's impoverished. As Jamal and his orphaned brother start out, they are driven from the slums by a murderous religious riot (where the cops act annoyed as a flaming body races by screaming), the find themselves in a nightmare Orphan camp, pimped out by a deadly keeper, caught inside the web of an Indian Mobster's empire, and then Jamal finally incarcerated by sadistic law enforcement. He's a mere question from beating the game, yet no-one wants to admit that this ""slumdog"" could know so much.The difference between knowledge and experience is what drives ""Slumdog Millionaire,"" and what drives Jamal is his love for Lakita (the stunning beauty, Freida Pinto). Even as his brother and he grow apart, Jamal can't stop pursuing his dream, and like all the good fairy-tales, ""Slumdog Millionaire"" has both a Prince and Princess.

1226364,AJYGQV81FSFE2,B001P9KR8U,Timothy P. Scanlon,"[2, 4]","I spend a little over two years in a hi-rise just adjacent to a bhasti (slum) in Calcutta not unlike the one portrayed in Mumbai in this film. That's what induced me to want to see it.Interesting, though. The last Danny Boyle film I saw was the indy ""Sunshine,"" which, while having some pretty great special effects, was not scientifically realistic.A technique frequently used by directors these days is to show a time, then swing back some years, then back again, perhaps to the future, then back, perhaps to the present. It can be confusing, but Boyle uses the techique effectively in ""Slumdog Millionaire."" The film starts with Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) in a Mumbai police office. He's being brutally treated by the police for reasons you're not yet able to discern. Then you move to the past, while Malik is a boy in a Mumbai slum (surrounded, as they are, by the hi-rise condos of the affluent.)You realize that the police are accusing Malik of cheating. On what?Then the story goes closer to the present, to a game show in which Malik, the slumdog, is doing remarkably well. But the host and his lieutenants are asking, ""How can this kid from the slums know so much? Ahhh...that's why the police...Time shift again. Little Jamal is the victim of a mob attack of anti-Muslim activists who end up killing his mother while she's doing laundry amidst the Mumbai slum. But during the process he learned a little, and that little is the answer to the question posed to him in the game show.The time shifts proceed in little Jamal's life: he becomes a skilled con artist (from which he learns who's on the US $100 bill; see it. You'll know what I'm talking about), then is picked up by the the personnel of an ""orphanage"" who uses both Jamal, his brother, and Latika (Frieda Pinto), another orphan they met during a torrential rainstorm.My spouse finds it hard to tolerate violence on screen. So it was terribly difficult for her to sit through what was going on both in the Mumbai police office and at the ""orphanage."" I won't give away what that brutality is in both because I know it's true and because it might discourage some others from seeing the film, and to then learn of that which discouraged my spouse.Malik pursues Latika through the film, at risk of more violence and death. And the time-shifts show what the two of them--as well as Malik's brother--grew up with.It's a powerful script revolving, in the final analyis, on ""The Three Musketeers."" Yes, that IS a teaser. (Hint: Jamal, his brother, Latika...And again, the timeshifts were effective in showing what the gameshow host couldn't figure out, that even a slumdog could have answers to the questions the host was asking! If I have an ""objection"" to the script, is that it was a tad too romantic for my tastes. Not that Jamal pursued Latika. Heaven knows most of us probably have visions of ourselves pursuing something--money or love--through thick and thin. But just about every romance ends the same way.How the story got to the end is what redeems it: our assumptions that a kid of Jamal's background couldn't have possibly had the brains to know what he did; that his way up the ladder was riddled with abuse and violence...I recommend the film but warn you that there are scenes that will shock you--and they're based on fact, not on speculative or gangster fiction.But there are no end surprises.",4,May encourage one to ask: What is progress?,1233705600,"02 4, 2009",2009,3371,"['spend', 'little', 'two', 'years', 'hi-rise', 'just', 'adjacent', 'bhasti', 'slum', 'Calcutta', 'not', 'one', 'portrayed', 'Mumbai', 'film', 'what', 'induced', 'want', 'see', 'it.Interesting', 'though', 'last', 'Danny', 'Boyle', 'film', 'saw', 'was', 'indy', 'Sunshine', 'having', 'pretty', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'was', 'not', 'scientifically', 'realistic.A', 'technique', 'frequently', 'used', 'directors', 'days', 'show', 'time', 'then', 'swing', 'back', 'years', 'then', 'back', 'again', 'perhaps', 'future', 'then', 'back', 'perhaps', 'present', 'can', 'be', 'confusing', 'Boyle', 'techique', 'effectively', 'Slumdog', 'Millionaire', 'film', 'Jamal', 'Malik', 'Dev', 'Patel', 'Mumbai', 'police', 'office', 'being', 'brutally', 'treated', 'police', 'reasons', ""'re"", 'not', 'yet', 'able', 'discern', 'Then', 'move', 'past', 'Malik', 'boy', 'Mumbai', 'slum', 'surrounded', 'are', 'hi-rise', 'condos', 'affluent', 'realize', 'police', 'are', 'accusing', 'Malik', 'cheating', 'what', 'Then', 'story', 'closer', 'present', 'game', 'show', 'Malik', 'slumdog', 'doing', 'remarkably', 'well', 'host', 'lieutenants', 'are', 'asking', 'How', 'can', 'kid', 'slums', 'know', 'so', 'much', 'Ahhh', 'why', 'police', 'Time', 'shift', 'again', 'Little', 'Jamal', 'victim', 'mob', 'attack', 'anti-Muslim', 'activists', 'who', 'end', 'up', 'killing', 'mother', 'doing', 'laundry', 'Mumbai', 'slum', 'process', 'learned', 'little', 'little', 'answer', 'question', 'posed', 'game', 'show.The', 'time', 'shifts', 'proceed', 'little', 'Jamal', 'life', 'skilled', 'con', 'artist', 'who', 'US', '100', 'bill', 'see', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking', 'then', 'picked', 'up', 'personnel', 'orphanage', 'who', 'Jamal', 'brother', 'Latika', 'Frieda', 'Pinto', 'met', 'torrential', 'rainstorm.My', 'spouse', 'hard', 'tolerate', 'violence', 'screen', 'was', 'terribly', 'difficult', 'sit', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'Mumbai', 'police', 'office', 'orphanage', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'what', 'brutality', 'know', 'true', 'might', 'discourage', 'others', 'seeing', 'film', 'then', 'learn', 'discouraged', 'spouse.Malik', 'pursues', 'Latika', 'film', 'risk', 'more', 'violence', 'death', 'time-shifts', 'show', 'what', 'two', 'as', 'well', 'Malik', 'brother', 'grew', 'up', 'with.It', 'powerful', 'script', 'revolving', 'final', 'analyis', 'Three', 'Musketeers', 'Yes', 'teaser', 'Hint', 'Jamal', 'brother', 'Latika', 'again', 'timeshifts', 'were', 'effective', 'showing', 'what', 'gameshow', 'host', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'even', 'slumdog', 'could', 'have', 'answers', 'questions', 'host', 'was', 'asking', 'have', 'objection', 'script', 'was', 'tad', 'too', 'romantic', 'tastes', 'Not', 'Jamal', 'pursued', 'Latika', 'Heaven', 'most', 'probably', 'have', 'visions', 'ourselves', 'pursuing', 'something', 'money', 'love', 'thick', 'thin', 'just', 'romance', 'same', 'way.How', 'story', 'got', 'end', 'what', 'assumptions', 'kid', 'Jamal', 'background', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'possibly', 'had', 'brains', 'know', 'what', 'did', 'way', 'ladder', 'was', 'riddled', 'abuse', 'violence', 'recommend', 'film', 'warn', 'are', 'scenes', 'will', 'shock', ""'re"", 'based', 'fact', 'not', 'speculative', 'gangster', 'fiction.But', 'are', 'end']",N/A

1226366,A1RNMPOY4XIAA8,B001P9KR8U,Tristan,"[1, 6]","As someone who watches a lot of movies, and especially loves the dark, dramatic, serious ones that get showered with Oscars, I was excited to see Slumdog Millionaire when it finally arrived on DVD. However after seeing it I was left with the same feeling as There Will Be Blood in 2007--and for those who were blessed with missing that little film, in short I think it will be on ""The most overhyped of all time"" list.After missing it in theaters (I blame limited release and school schedules) I finally rented a copy and sat down to watch the much anticipated and lavishly praised and reviewed film. After all according to the Academy this was the best picture of 2008. It started with a jolt (literally, as electrocuting a teenager's toes was not the kind of beginning I had in mind for a feel-good underdog story) the main character, Jamal I believe, is being tortured by a thug hired by the host of India's ""Who wants to be a millionaire"". Yes, you read that right, tortured because he has gotten to 10 million rupees (no slumdog--as they are called--ever has) and the host thinks he is cheating.The rest of the film is each question being asked of him and subsequent flashback to describe how he came to know which American president appears on the one hundred dollar bill, and so forth.Oh yes, and how could I forget there is a girl, yes a girl Jamal is pining after the entire movie. She is the on that got away. Mixed in with the flash backs is a story of how Jamal from a small age became an orphan. A slumdog.I have no criticisms for the technical aspects, the cinematography is wonderful with the camera racing through the claustrophobic streets of overcrowded slums as a small Jamal and his brother race to get away from a cop hard on their heels. My criticism lies in that dreaded feeling (I felt the same in There Will Be Blood) that all movie buffs hate...""that's it?""I started to think maybe I missed something. Maybe just maybe I did not quite read into the story as much as my English professor would have liked; but the more I thought I realized this, just like 2007s There Will Be Blood is another Overhyped, Over-awarded picture that just hit the majority of the critics just right.Still days after I kept think why, oh why was this so recommended even by regular moviegoers and friends. I remember The Kite Runner a couple years back that failed miserable due to (what many cited in their reviews) the child rape scene. This didn't have it quite that bad, but pouring acid in a 5 year old kid's eyes is pretty disturbing for a ""happy"" little guy against insurmountable odds story. So, I thought some more until it hit me...it's all about timing!In this massive, global economic downturn, academy voters and movie audiences didn't want to see a three hour movie were a previously named ""sexiest man alive"" actor ages backwards, or the border-on-pedophilia love affair of a fifteen year old boy and a thirty-some-odd year old female Nazi prison guard. And with the election finally over after almost an entire year of watching debates, reading polls, hearing soaring speeches, and watching a myriad of interviews; let's just say the mood for political dramas weren't exactly the hottest ticket. Especially when the two films in questions were about a disgraced Republican president who lied (sound familiar?) being interviewed and after the infamously entertaining and just as catastrophic Couric/Palin interview that is a tough sell. Oh and the other--an assassination of the first publicly elected gay man (Prop 8 anyone? If one of the most liberal states in the union failed to stop prop 8, how did the studio think they were going to be able to market and sell tickets to the rest of the nation). What audiences wanted was that rags-to-riches romance, a basic plot line that makes Cinderella such an endearing classic.

1226367,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B001P9KR8U,Turfseer,"[3, 6]","Slumdog Millionaire chronicles the odyssey of Jamal Malik from the slums of Bombay to now modern Mumbai. The film's framing device is Malik's attempt to win the Hindi version of ""Who wants to be a Millionaire"". He ends up answering each question correctly and a day before he attempts to answer the final question for the grand prize, he's whisked away by the police on suspicion of fraud. The police want to know how a kid from the slums could possibly answer all those questions correctly. As they question him (sometimes using torture at first), the viewer is treated to a series of flashbacks which explains how he's able to successfully answer each question.The first half of the movie (the much better part) involves Malik first as a young child (of about five) and later at about the age of 10 (played by two different child actors). Malik's older brother, Salim, is the more aggressive of the two, in contrast to the sensitive younger brother. We see how they are orphaned at an early age when their mother is killed during a riot where Hindus attack Muslims. The children must fend for themselves in the slums of Bombay and there are many memorable and shocking scenes that chronicle their tactics of survival. One indelible scene involves Malik securing an autograph from a famous Indian singer who is on a publicity tour in the area. Malik extricates himself from inside a locked latrine and appears at the autograph signing covered head to toe in human excrement. Eventually Malik and Salim are lured by a gang of criminals who end up training them to become professional beggars. The gang goes so far as to increasing their profits by blinding certain children who have sweet singing voices. The blind children are used by the criminals to manipulate unsuspecting tourists who feel sorry for the now handicapped children. Salim alerts Malik to the gang's nefarious plan and they escape along with another child, Latika who Malik falls in love with.At the midpoint of the film, with Salim now a young teenager, he takes revenge on head of the gang who almost blinded Malik by shooting him to death. But Salim incurs Malik's enmity by raping Latika. Flash forward to the present as we find Malik working at a menial job as a gopher at a large international customer service company. Malik eventually locates Salim who is now working for the boss of Mumbai's biggest crime syndicate. And he finds out that Latika is basically an indentured servant in the boss's mansion. In the film's climax, the police release Malik who goes on to answer the final question correctly and hooks back up with Latika who escapes the crime boss's lair (with the help of Salim, who, in a final act of contrition, sacrifices himself by murdering the crime boss and in turn is killed by the boss's bodyguards).Slumdog Millionaire has a lot going for it. It's highly entertaining and features some great performances (especially by the child actors in the first half). Dev Patel as Malik is also excellent as the low-key hero who eventually gets the girl. The passionate conflict between the two brothers adds to the verisimilitude of the story.Slumdog is really designed to be a gritty fairy tale. But even fairy tales must have some kind of internal logic. The weakest part of the story for me was the whole idea that the producer of the 'Millionaire' show was some kind of crook who wanted to fix things so Malik would lose. And was it at all believable, that Malik, who had become a national hero, would suddenly be brought in by the police and tortured merely because they could not believe a kid from the slums could answer such the tough questions on the show? In reality, the police would never have chanced abducting Malik while the show was going on and risk losing their jobs due to possible adverse press coverage. And why would the producer of the show want Malik to lose? If he wins, the producer's ratings go much higher and he makes more money.Slumdog also stumbles by becoming a Bollywood production in the second half. The villain in the first half, the child exploiter is much more believable and menacing than the crime syndicate boss in the second half. And Latika is wholly an underdeveloped character--she has nothing much to do except being the love object of Malik.I'm not sure if Slumdog Millionaire deserved to win the Academy Award for best picture. For all its shotcomings, it's still a solid piece of entertainment and will keep you riveted in your seat.",3,Occasionally cheesy Bollywood-like Production still entertains!,1236988800,"03 14, 2009",2009,4471,"['Slumdog', 'Millionaire', 'odyssey', 'Jamal', 'Malik', 'slums', 'Bombay', 'now', 'modern', 'Mumbai', 'film', 'framing', 'device', 'Malik', 'attempt', 'win', 'Hindi', 'version', 'Who', 'be', 'Millionaire', 'up', 'answering', 'question', 'correctly', 'day', 'answer', 'final', 'question', 'grand', 'prize', 'whisked', 'away', 'police', 'suspicion', 'fraud', 'police', 'want', 'know', 'how', 'kid', 'slums', 'could', 'possibly', 'answer', 'questions', 'correctly', 'question', 'sometimes', 'using', 'torture', 'first', 'viewer', 'treated', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'how', 'able', 'successfully', 'answer', 'question.The', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'much', 'better', 'part', 'Malik', 'first', 'young', 'child', 'about', 'five', 'later', 'age', '10', 'played', 'two', 'different', 'child', 'actors', 'Malik', 'older', 'brother', 'Salim', 'more', 'aggressive', 'two', 'contrast', 'sensitive', 'younger', 'brother', 'see', 'how', 'are', 'orphaned', 'early', 'age', 'when', 'mother', 'killed', 'riot', 'where', 'Hindus', 'attack', 'Muslims', 'children', 'must', 'fend', 'slums', 'Bombay', 'are', 'many', 'memorable', 'shocking', 'scenes', 'chronicle', 'tactics', 'survival', 'One', 'indelible', 'scene', 'Malik', 'securing', 'autograph', 'famous', 'Indian', 'singer', 'who', 'publicity', 'tour', 'area', 'Malik', 'locked', 'latrine', 'autograph', 'signing', 'covered', 'head', 'toe', 'human', 'excrement', 'Eventually', 'Malik', 'Salim', 'are', 'lured', 'gang', 'criminals', 'who', 'end', 'up', 'training', 'become', 'professional', 'beggars', 'gang', 'so', 'far', 'increasing', 'profits', 'blinding', 'certain', 'children', 'who', 'have', 'sweet', 'singing', 'voices', 'blind', 'children', 'are', 'used', 'criminals', 'manipulate', 'unsuspecting', 'tourists', 'who', 'feel', 'sorry', 'now', 'handicapped', 'children', 'Salim', 'Malik', 'gang', 'nefarious', 'plan', 'escape', 'child', 'Latika', 'who', 'Malik', 'love', 'with.At', 'midpoint', 'film', 'Salim', 'now', 'young', 'teenager', 'revenge', 'head', 'gang', 'who', 'almost', 'blinded', 'Malik', 'shooting', 'death', 'Salim', 'incurs', 'Malik', 'enmity', 'raping', 'Latika', 'Flash', 'forward', 'present', 'find', 'Malik', 'working', 'menial', 'job', 'gopher', 'large', 'international', 'customer', 'service', 'company', 'Malik', 'eventually', 'Salim', 'who', 'now', 'working', 'boss', 'Mumbai', 'biggest', 'crime', 'syndicate', 'out', 'Latika', 'basically', 'indentured', 'servant', 'boss', 'mansion', 'film', 'climax', 'police', 'release', 'Malik', 'who', 'answer', 'final', 'question', 'correctly', 'back', 'up', 'Latika', 'who', 'crime', 'boss', 'lair', 'help', 'Salim', 'who', 'final', 'act', 'contrition', 'sacrifices', 'murdering', 'crime', 'boss', 'turn', 'killed', 'boss', 'bodyguards', '.Slumdog', 'Millionaire', 'lot', 'going', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'great', 'performances', 'especially', 'child', 'actors', 'first', 'half', 'Dev', 'Patel', 'Malik', 'also', 'excellent', 'low-key', 'hero', 'who', 'eventually', 'girl', 'passionate', 'conflict', 'two', 'brothers', 'verisimilitude', 'story.Slumdog', 'really', 'designed', 'be', 'gritty', 'fairy', 'tale', 'even', 'fairy', 'tales', 'must', 'have', 'kind', 'internal', 'logic', 'weakest', 'part', 'story', 'was', 'whole', 'idea', 'producer', ""'Millionaire"", 'show', 'was', 'kind', 'crook', 'who', 'wanted', 'fix', 'things', 'so', 'Malik', 'would', 'lose', 'was', 'believable', 'Malik', 'who', 'had', 'become', 'national', 'hero', 'would', 'suddenly', 'be', 'brought', 'police', 'tortured', 'merely', 'could', 'not', 'believe', 'kid', 'slums', 'could', 'answer', 'tough', 'questions', 'show', 'reality', 'police', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'chanced', 'abducting', 'Malik', 'show', 'was', 'going', 'risk', 'losing', 'jobs', 'due', 'possible', 'adverse', 'press', 'coverage', 'why', 'would', 'producer', 'show', 'want', 'Malik', 'lose', 'producer', 'ratings', 'go', 'much', 'higher', 'more', 'money.Slumdog', 'also', 'stumbles', 'becoming', 'Bollywood', 'production', 'second', 'half', 'villain', 'first', 'half', 'child', 'exploiter', 'much', 'more', 'believable', 'menacing', 'crime', 'syndicate', 'boss', 'second', 'half', 'Latika', 'wholly', 'underdeveloped', 'character', 'nothing', 'much', 'do', 'being', 'love', 'object', 'Malik.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'Slumdog', 'Millionaire', 'deserved', 'win', 'Academy', 'Award', 'best', 'picture', 'shotcomings', 'still', 'solid', 'piece', 'entertainment', 'will', 'keep', 'riveted', 'seat']",N/A

Why not, big business has caused films to lose all the elements that make the movie going public want to sit in a theater. No one knows how to tell a good story, put the right actors in the right role, and even know how to tug at the human emotions. Slumdog Millionaire on the other hand, did know what to do.This film is the story of a boy named Jamal who came out of the slums of Mumbai India, to end up on the Indian version of the hit game show Who Wants To Be A Millionaire...and he wins! Because of that he is thrust into the worst few hours of his life because he was accused of cheating. You'd like to think his spirit is being crushed, then the story begins, the story of how he knew each and every answer. Then as the story unfolds you are brought into a grand story of family, survival, betrayal and true love. The real heavy hitter is when the police find out exactly why Jamal got on that show and it really makes you wonder about your own life and what truly are treasures in our lives.I was blown away by this movie for many different reasons. The acting, the story, the music...you name it was a cut above everything I had seen all year. This movie could not have been released in a better time. A time when we in America think we have it bad during a time of misfortune. It teaches us to really look deep inside and find what matters to us and not take things for granted. This movie should also teach the big movie companies a thing or two. I think it is time to stop figuring out how much money a movie can make and just put a great story on the screen.

This is the question that launches Danny Boyle's tenderly sublime Slumdog Millionaire, 2008's best chance at a film that will both earn the respect of critics and satisfy audiences (well, other than that little movie about a billionaire moonlighting as a crime-fighter).The film begins just as Jamal's first episode on Millionaire has ended, when the sounding alarm prevents India's version of Regis from asking the final question.  Because of Jamal's lowly socio-economic status, the producers and authorities believe him to be a cheat and begin a Guantanamo-like search for answers.  After some brutal torture tactics (yes, brutal) do not achieve the desired results, Jamal is able to plead his innocence by explaining how he knew the answers to the questions.Each answer comes with a vignette from his young life, and those scenes make up the majority of the film.  In the accompanying story to his answer about a poet, we learn of a time when he sang poems as a street beggar and in his answer to ""who invented the revolver"", we hear about the time he saw a gun fired.  Something almost supernatural seems to be at play, as it appears that someone followed Jamal through his life and selected questions relating to moments forever burned into his memory.An ever-present theme to his stories is his desire to reconnect with a girl from his youth.  Like Estella to Pip or Jenny to Forrest, Jamal's Latika is a girl who first stumbled into his life at a young age and has lived in his dreams ever since.  Even in the most dire circumstances and seemingly unlivable conditions, Jamal is able to survive in part because of his memories of Latika and his need to find her, to rescue her, and to care for her.Equal parts David Copperfield and Artful Dodger, Jamal is always shown to be clever, resilient and slippery.  For a film that's sure to inspire audiences with its sweet, enchanting core, we're also given a look at the horrors of poverty, the absurdity of religious warring and the gloomy life of orphans.  It's impossible to not think of the kids like Jamal and Latika who aren't able to escape the slums, but that's a story for another day.  The one we're given is a refreshing mixture of romance, adventure and coming of age poignancy, all wrapped up in an immediately identifiable piece of pop culture.What's the most emotionally satisfying film experience this year?

It starts with Jamal orphaned by lethal sectarian violence, his childhood friend turning to guns and violence, his cute little female friend turned into - well, you get the picture.

I don't want to steal a thread that has been circulating around the reviews for this product, but it does seem to be a bit contrived in its storytelling method, where a poor contestant on the Indian version of ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire"" wows the entire nation with his knowledge of matters that should be beyond him.  Over the course of the movie, though, viewers are shown exactly how he came to know the answers to those questions through a series of flashbacks.The film did a good enough job of building suspense that I could give it four stars over three, but I think its biggest downfall was that the central romance of the film was not a little more fleshed out.  The romantic angle is supposed to provide the great drama at the end of the film, but instead (at least to me) it fell a bit flat in the notion that there wasn't enough romantic chemistry built up along the way.Thus, while I loved the ""Millionaire"" segments and the ensuing drama that this film created, I felt that the background stories weren't quite compelling enough to turn this film into a classic.  However, it is one of those unique movies that a person must see for themselves to make an accurate judgment on, so I would urge you to check it out.

1226380,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B001P9KR8U,Z Hayes,"[7, 11]","""Slumdog Milionaire"" is definitely a feel-good movie - from early on,young Jamal [Dev Patel] wins our hearts as he desperately tries to find his childhood sweetheart Latika [Freida Pinto] by entering the Indian version of ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"" Incredulous and sceptical of Jamal's intelligence [after all, Jamal is a 'slumdog'], the show's host [Anil Kapoor] gets him carted off by the police for interrogation. Faced by the cynical inspector [Irfan Khan of ""Namesake""], Jamal proceeds to convince the policeman of his innocence by recounting his childhood experiences till the present that accounts for his almost miraculous run of good luck on the show.I loved the child actors in this show - the ones who played Jamal, his brother Salim and Latika as children were absolutely incredible and wholly credible as street children struggling to survive, falling prey to the most predatory and repugnant of criminals, those who maim children in order that the kids may 'convincingly' beg on the streets to fill the criminals coffers. One of the most horrifying scenes in this movie is the part where the criminal mastermind watches over the removal of a little boy's eyes.So why only 3 stars you may ask - I liked this movie a lot but I did find that it didn't truly explore the plight of street children which it purportedly aims to portray on-screen. The coverage somehow seems shallow, using the story arc of the child maiming syndicate to shock audiences instead. Perhaps this is due to the fact that I've watched too many Indian movies that deal more convincingly with such themes - ""Nayagan"" [Tamil, starring Kamal Hasan, a renowned South Indian actor], Thalapathi [Tamil, stars Rajni Kanth], the incomparable Salaam Bombay [1988,Hindi by Mira Nair], and also City of Joy [1992, English, starring Patrick Swayze] all are more credible in showing the plight of street children.""Slumdog Millionaire"" on the other hand is a Bollywood fairytale with a predictably happy ending. It makes one feel good, and in a world filled with cruelty and depravity, most of us are happy to see the fulfillment of Jamal's dreams. But reality is very different, and the majority of street children in India will never experience even a fraction of the success that Jamal attains in this movie.
