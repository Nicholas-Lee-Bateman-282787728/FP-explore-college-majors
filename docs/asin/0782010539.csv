Al Freeman, who one cannot stop thinking of as Elijah Muhammad after the Malcolm X movie, is quite good as the kind of strong and wise patriarchs once common, but sadly missing in today's Black America.This is essentially a series of vignettes about a young boy's life from 1946 to 1962 in Mississippi. But the vignettes do not flow well together and the story is full of holes (How did the Uncle get into passing out voter registration flyers? what happened to Uncle cleve after the boycott? What happened to the boy's father? How did the grandfather explain the KKK to his grandson after the encounter? etc. etc.).

41707,ACXHNOC6L8LUO,0782010539,Artist & Author,"[5, 7]","I think this is a movie that everybody who has not had regular contact with African Americans should see.  There isn't really much of a plot, but I wouldn't say that it lags either.  Its main benefit for African Americans, especially senior citizens, would be to be reminded of how it was.  For the younger ones, it would help 'flesh out' their culture's history.  For those whose main 'knowledge' of African Americans is the news and television or movies, this will be a wonderful way to see that no matter what the color, people are, emotionally, basically the same.  We all are just trying to make the best of whatever situation in which we find ourselves.My father had dozens of apartments when integration became the law.  When we let in the first black family in a building, virtually all the 'white trash' moved out.  Very quickly, we realized that the black tenants were much cleaner and more desirable as tenants.  I am also old enough to remember the 'whites' and 'colored' restrooms and drinking fountains.  My cousins marched in the South's integration marches.  The point is that if everyone saw African Americans as the great majority of them really are, and not as portrayed in the media, there would be much less tension between races.  This is a good movie to see them as most of them really are like.Only three (and a half) stars is due to a lack of a real plot - this shows more like a documentary biography than a drama.",3,A People as Most of Them Really Are,1182384000,"06 21, 2007",2007,1440,"['think', 'movie', 'everybody', 'who', 'not', 'had', 'regular', 'contact', 'African', 'Americans', 'should', 'see', ""n't"", 'really', 'much', 'plot', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'either', 'main', 'benefit', 'African', 'Americans', 'especially', 'senior', 'citizens', 'would', 'be', 'be', 'reminded', 'how', 'was', 'younger', 'ones', 'would', 'help', ""'flesh"", 'out', 'culture', 'history', 'main', ""'knowledge"", 'African', 'Americans', 'news', 'television', 'movies', 'will', 'be', 'wonderful', 'way', 'see', 'matter', 'what', 'color', 'people', 'are', 'emotionally', 'basically', 'same', 'are', 'just', 'trying', 'make', 'best', 'situation', 'find', 'ourselves.My', 'father', 'had', 'dozens', 'apartments', 'when', 'integration', 'became', 'law', 'When', 'let', 'first', 'black', 'family', 'building', 'virtually', ""'white"", 'trash', 'moved', 'out', 'Very', 'quickly', 'realized', 'black', 'tenants', 'were', 'much', 'cleaner', 'more', 'desirable', 'tenants', 'am', 'also', 'old', 'enough', 'remember', ""'whites"", ""'colored"", 'restrooms', 'drinking', 'fountains', 'cousins', 'marched', 'South', 'integration', 'marches', 'point', 'everyone', 'saw', 'African', 'Americans', 'great', 'majority', 'really', 'are', 'not', 'portrayed', 'media', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'less', 'tension', 'races', 'good', 'movie', 'see', 'most', 'really', 'are', 'like.Only', 'three', 'half', 'due', 'lack', 'real', 'plot', 'more', 'documentary', 'biography', 'drama']",N/A

He still finds himself in too many schlocky TV movies,  and weak situation comedies. One must pay the rent,  and no one can argue with that.More and more a champion of black film,  he has been careful, deliberate in his choice of projects to produce. Once  Upon a Time When We Were Colored, elevates him, appropriately, as a serious  filmmaker, black, white, or otherwise.This is not a `new' film, but it  is a different approach. An insightful look into Afro-American existence  during turbulent times, the  focus is on the community, rather than the  oppression, the individuals rather than the cause. The result is every bit  as effective in getting the message across. `You get more flies with  honey...'Al Freeman Jr. gets a well-deserved opportunity to show that he's  not just some kind of TV Morgan Freeman. His portrayal of Poppa, the family  patriarch is wonderful and slighted unfortunately by the Academy. Even the  Image awards overlooked him, preferring to bestow honor on the over-cooked  and under-talented Phylicia Rashad, one of the only weak links in this  strong cast.

A young woman suddenly goes into labor and quickly delivers Cliff, the main character. The rest of the movie is about Cliff growing up in the Deep South from 1946-62. It's the story of Cliff's grandparents and aunt taking responsibility for raising Cliff when the family of his father refuse to have anything to do with him and his young, unmarried mother is unable to do so. It's about a community of African-Americans forced to live separately but (un)equally in a white dominated society where we see Grandad teaching little Cliff how to recognize 'W' and 'C' so he drinks from the correct fountain and uses the right bathroom. It's about a proud community that is willing to work hard and long for meager wages and still not accept charity. It's about a kind, white woman that keeps Cliff in supply of good reading when she realizes 'coloreds' aren't allowed in the library. It's about a community that worships together in a style and form that helps them overcome the daily oppression. And, finally, it's about hope that doing the right thing will eventually be rewarded. There is a feeling that this is probably very much what it was like to grow up in 1950's Mississippi. The only objectionable family scenes might be a brief fight in a bar setting where some sensual dancing between couples takes place and when Cliff and a friend sneak into the burlesque show tent at the circus. None of it is graphic or overemphasized. As one of the characters responded when asked why he returned to Glen Allan to visit, 'to remind me of why I left', so this movie should remind us of why we left discrimination 'officially' behind and why we must work to keep it behind.
