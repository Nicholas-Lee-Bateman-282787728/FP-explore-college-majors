It is the first of the two. You will not know the meaning of the play's title till almost the end of the play, and the actors' being the embodiment of a culture that had disappeared makes this all the more poignant. All performances in this play are stellar, and the author tells us that it was only after he started working with the 4-person cast that he knew what the play was about, and where it was taking place.

""Amazing,"" says Jack.This play by David Storey, preserved on tape and DVD by Broadway Theatre Archive, is one of those things where meaning slips in almost unnoticed between the words. Literal viewers will probably find themselves adrift amidst pauses, fragments of dialogue and inconsequential small talk that appears to go nowhere. Stay with it and you'll enter a world where reality shifts bit by bit, where the tail end of life can seem as hopeless as it seems, in a poignant way, funny and sad, where parallels to Britain's national condition come into focus. More than anything else, you'll find yourself witnessing two star acting turns by Ralph Richardson, then 70, and John Gielgud, then 68.We meet Harry (Gielgud) and Jack (Richardson) on the grounds of what seems to be a home for the elderly. They are two aging men, carefully dressed, discrete and polite, considerate and...a bit off. Gradually we realize the home for the elderly must be a home for those with mental problems, where treacle pud and making baskets in ""remedial"" are topics of conversation. They and we encounter Kathleen (Mona Washbourne) and her friend Marjorie (Dandy Nichols), two women from an entirely different class, who have their own stories which are as shifting as Jack's and Harry's. Jack and Harry talk to each other. Kathleen and Marjorie talk to each other. The four talk amongst themselves. Eventually Harry and Jack walk off together. Then Kathleen and Marjorie leave. We realize the next day will be much the same as this day...and this day turned out to be a bit sadder and braver than we expected. However, as Jack points out, ""The older one grows, the more one takes into account other people's foibles. If a person can't be what they are, what's the point of being anything at all?""Gielgud and Richardson, two of the three great acting knights of Britain, made their reputations in the classic roles. As they aged, the British theater changed as playwrights such as John Osborne and Storey found an audience that appreciated the view of an England propped up by tradition and decaying from within. Just as Olivier was able to recast himself by starring in Osborne's The Entertainer, Gielgud and Richardson broke through contemporary barriers by appearing in Home. They do magnificent jobs of it.This is a recording of the stage play. The action takes place around a table and chairs in the courtyard of the institution. It might seem limiting, except that Storey's words and the acting carry us along. The DVD picture has the quality of a VHS tape; not great but not bad.",4,"Sad, Brave And Superbly Acted By Richardson And Gielgud",1138838400,"02 2, 2006",2006,2707,"['Clouds', 'Harry', 'Watch', 'different', 'shapes', 'See', 'how', 'drift', 'apart', 'First', 'sight', 'nothing', 'Then', 'just', 'watch', 'edges', 'See', 'Amazing', 'Jack.This', 'play', 'David', 'Storey', 'preserved', 'tape', 'DVD', 'Broadway', 'Theatre', 'Archive', 'one', 'things', 'where', 'meaning', 'slips', 'almost', 'unnoticed', 'words', 'Literal', 'viewers', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'adrift', 'amidst', 'pauses', 'fragments', 'dialogue', 'inconsequential', 'small', 'talk', 'go', 'nowhere', 'Stay', ""'ll"", 'enter', 'world', 'where', 'reality', 'shifts', 'bit', 'bit', 'where', 'tail', 'end', 'life', 'can', 'seem', 'as', 'hopeless', 'poignant', 'way', 'funny', 'sad', 'where', 'parallels', 'Britain', 'national', 'condition', 'come', 'focus', 'More', 'anything', 'else', ""'ll"", 'find', 'witnessing', 'two', 'star', 'acting', 'turns', 'Ralph', 'Richardson', 'then', '70', 'John', 'Gielgud', 'then', '68.We', 'meet', 'Harry', 'Gielgud', 'Jack', 'Richardson', 'grounds', 'what', 'be', 'home', 'elderly', 'are', 'two', 'aging', 'men', 'carefully', 'dressed', 'discrete', 'polite', 'considerate', 'bit', 'off', 'Gradually', 'realize', 'home', 'elderly', 'must', 'be', 'home', 'mental', 'problems', 'where', 'treacle', 'pud', 'making', 'baskets', 'remedial', 'are', 'topics', 'conversation', 'encounter', 'Kathleen', 'Mona', 'Washbourne', 'friend', 'Marjorie', 'Dandy', 'Nichols', 'two', 'women', 'entirely', 'different', 'class', 'who', 'have', 'own', 'stories', 'are', 'as', 'shifting', 'Jack', 'Harry', 'Jack', 'Harry', 'talk', 'other', 'Kathleen', 'Marjorie', 'talk', 'other', 'four', 'talk', 'amongst', 'Eventually', 'Harry', 'Jack', 'walk', 'together', 'Then', 'Kathleen', 'Marjorie', 'leave', 'realize', 'next', 'day', 'will', 'be', 'much', 'same', 'day', 'day', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'bit', 'sadder', 'braver', 'expected', 'However', 'Jack', 'out', 'older', 'one', 'grows', 'more', 'one', 'account', 'other', 'people', 'foibles', 'person', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'what', 'are', 'what', 'point', 'being', 'anything', 'Gielgud', 'Richardson', 'two', 'three', 'great', 'acting', 'knights', 'Britain', 'made', 'reputations', 'classic', 'roles', 'aged', 'British', 'theater', 'changed', 'playwrights', 'such', 'John', 'Osborne', 'Storey', 'found', 'audience', 'appreciated', 'view', 'England', 'propped', 'up', 'tradition', 'decaying', 'Just', 'Olivier', 'was', 'able', 'recast', 'starring', 'Osborne', 'Entertainer', 'Gielgud', 'Richardson', 'broke', 'contemporary', 'barriers', 'appearing', 'Home', 'do', 'magnificent', 'jobs', 'it.This', 'recording', 'stage', 'play', 'action', 'place', 'table', 'chairs', 'courtyard', 'institution', 'might', 'seem', 'limiting', 'Storey', 'words', 'acting', 'carry', 'along', 'DVD', 'picture', 'quality', 'VHS', 'tape', 'not', 'great', 'not', 'bad']",N/A

715090,A319KYEIAZ3SON,B00006G8HL,Mary Whipple,"[21, 21]","Winner of the New York Critics Best Play of the Year Award in 1970, this hilariously funny but ineffably sad, five-character play by David Storey, directed by Lindsay Anderson, pairs Sir Ralph Richardson and Sir John Gielgud as two proud men who meet and talk in the garden of what appears to be some sort of assisted living facility.  Well-spoken Jack (Richardson) and Harry (Gielgud), dressed in jackets and ties and carrying a cane and gloves, are clearly men of some status as they meet and make small talk--about the news, the clouds, varieties of chrysanthemums, whether Vale Evesham in England is the Garden of Eden, and the fact that their wives are not going to be visiting that day.When they go off for a walk, two raucous and uninhibited women (brilliantly played by Mona Washbourne and Dandy Nichols) take their places in the garden, completely changing the mood.  Kathleen (Washbourne) and Marjorie (Nichols) are obviously from a different background, with different accents, casual attitudes towards clothing and hygiene, bawdy humor, and a willingness to say absolutely anything.  The fact that the women joke about having had shoelaces and belts removed and to being admitted involuntarily, one for the second time, ironically change our view of Jack and Harry, who they really are, and why they may be there.When the men and the women all meet in the garden after lunch, their need to communicate, when they have so little in common, is touching.  The men stay true to their class and upbringing and the women true to their own backgrounds, but all get teary at various times, and as they try to help each other, despite the fact their paths would never have crossed in ""real"" life, their universal need for companionship and understanding is highlighted.  As the characters begin to confuse their stories, the viewer becomes aware that despite our hopes, the characters probably belong where they are.Author David Storey, a Booker Prize winner for his novel Saville, has won innumerable awards for his plays, and this one is breath-taking.  The actors are flawless, feeding off each other to make the play come alive.  Small gestures and camera close-ups, especially with Richardson and Gielgud, make the drama intimate and powerfully affecting, and the final scene, accented by silent tears, is unforgettable.  Productions like this are what theater is all about.

715091,A2NT656K8QYTX3,B00006G8HL,"PDC ""PoeBoy""","[0, 0]","The title of David Storey's quietly funny, quietly touching, and ultimately devastating play takes on multiple meanings in this quietly unforgettable tragi-comic drama.'Home' also contains four virtuoso performances which are, justifiably, the stuff of theatre legend -- reason enough to make this DVD a MUST for anyone who cares about great theatre and great acting. But, marvelous as Mona Washbourne and Dandy Nichols are, it is the protean performances of John Gielgud (as Harry) and Ralph Richardson (as Jack) that lifts this production into the stratosphere. (Which was also the case in Harold Pinter's equally brilliant play 'No Man's Land', luckily taped for television but unluckily (and criminally) unavailable for purchase.But take note: To watch the justifiably famed double-act of Richardson and Gielgud here is to behold a virtual master-class, distilling a lifetime's worth of theatrical knowledge into a mere 90 minutes. And what minutes they are! The four main actors are like a superb string quartet, with Warren Stevens providing occasional off-kilter counterpoint, as Gielgud's melancholy violin hauntingly contrasts and ultimately forms an ineffable duet with Richardson's rich, dark cello. And all is brilliantly orchestrated and conducted by Lindsay Anderson, here repeating his role as the ""maestro"" of London's original Royal Court production.And if any play was ever about what is NOT said, as opposed to the actual dialogue being spoken, it is, without doubt, Mr. Storey's remarkable 'Home'. In fact, it's sometimes as though two plays were being performed simultaneously -- one spoken and one unspoken; one seen and one deeply, painfully felt. Then, at the eloquent denoument, words fail altogether. And the final tableau, with both men standing in silent tears gazing at the last of the dying afternoon light, is an image you won't soon forget.",5,Home Again,1377907200,"08 31, 2013",2013,1872,"['title', 'David', 'Storey', 'quietly', 'funny', 'quietly', 'touching', 'ultimately', 'devastating', 'play', 'multiple', 'meanings', 'quietly', 'unforgettable', 'tragi-comic', 'drama', 'also', 'four', 'virtuoso', 'performances', 'are', 'justifiably', 'stuff', 'theatre', 'legend', 'reason', 'enough', 'make', 'DVD', 'MUST', 'anyone', 'who', 'great', 'theatre', 'great', 'acting', 'marvelous', 'Mona', 'Washbourne', 'Dandy', 'Nichols', 'are', 'protean', 'performances', 'John', 'Gielgud', 'Harry', 'Ralph', 'Richardson', 'Jack', 'production', 'stratosphere', 'Which', 'was', 'also', 'case', 'Harold', 'Pinter', 'equally', 'brilliant', 'play', 'Man', 'Land', 'luckily', 'taped', 'television', 'unluckily', 'criminally', 'unavailable', 'purchase.But', 'take', 'note', 'watch', 'justifiably', 'famed', 'double-act', 'Richardson', 'Gielgud', 'here', 'behold', 'virtual', 'master-class', 'distilling', 'lifetime', 'worth', 'theatrical', 'knowledge', 'mere', '90', 'minutes', 'what', 'minutes', 'are', 'four', 'main', 'actors', 'are', 'superb', 'string', 'quartet', 'Warren', 'Stevens', 'providing', 'occasional', 'off-kilter', 'counterpoint', 'Gielgud', 'melancholy', 'violin', 'hauntingly', 'contrasts', 'ultimately', 'ineffable', 'duet', 'Richardson', 'rich', 'dark', 'cello', 'brilliantly', 'orchestrated', 'conducted', 'Lindsay', 'Anderson', 'here', 'repeating', 'role', 'maestro', 'London', 'original', 'Royal', 'Court', 'production.And', 'play', 'was', 'ever', 'what', 'NOT', 'said', 'opposed', 'actual', 'dialogue', 'being', 'spoken', 'doubt', 'Mr.', 'Storey', 'remarkable', ""'Home"", 'fact', 'sometimes', 'two', 'plays', 'were', 'being', 'performed', 'simultaneously', 'one', 'spoken', 'one', 'unspoken', 'one', 'seen', 'one', 'deeply', 'painfully', 'felt', 'Then', 'eloquent', 'denoument', 'words', 'fail', 'altogether', 'final', 'tableau', 'men', 'standing', 'silent', 'tears', 'gazing', 'last', 'dying', 'afternoon', 'light', 'image', 'wo', ""n't"", 'soon', 'forget']",N/A
715092,AEXGGB9P0MOTN,B00006G8HL,"Sarah Hadley ""I'm a graduate student and Engl...","[6, 25]","I enjoy theatrical drama, and recently I have rented several of Broadway Theatre Archive's DVDs of classic televised plays. All of them I have enjoyed - with one, notable exception: ""Home.""To say that it's merely irritating is an understatement. Most of the time, the characters (all five of them) don't even speak in complete sentences; chiefly, they drift in and out of thought, responding to each other's half-muttered reflections on bygone days. That can work for a short play, but something that is 90 minutes long (not 120, as Amazon states) frankly needs more substance. The actual meaning of the play is, thus, left up almost totally to the audience. Are these characters in a mental institution? Are they dead, and in Heaven? Or are they simply on vacation? There's a few subtle clues, but nothing definite, and we're never given enough information to really form much of an opinion.The saddest thing about this production is the complete squandering of two great actors, Sir John Gielgud and Sir Ralph Richardson. Richardson is served particularly poorly, forced to play a somewhat confused character viewed with amused pity by Gielgud's more straightforward fellow. Still worse, their efforts are undermined by two female counterparts (played by Mona Washbourne and Dandy Nichols) who are little more than broad caricatures, and don't do anything to raise the proceedings beyond a combination of annoyance and boredom.Perhaps this play reads better on paper, though I rather doubt it. And it's possible that I've missed the ""point"" - certainly, someone else might get a lot more out of it than I. Yet I can't shake the feeling that I was looking for greatness, even goodness, that simply isn't present in this production.
