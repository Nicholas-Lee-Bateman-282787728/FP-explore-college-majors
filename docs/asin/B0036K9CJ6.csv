While experience and observation have helped us make a lot of sense out of the jumble of fossilized Dinosaur bones, behavior itself of course, does not fossilize.  Everything we believe we know about these creatures is extrapolated from bone desposits and observation of (very distant) living dino relatives.The effects are pretty decent, but it doesn't take a sharp eye to realize much of the animation was cannibalized from other shows.  With all that said, I was already aware of much of the information given so if you're ""experienced"" at this sort of thing, or have done a lot of reading/research on your own, there is likely not much for you in this series.I do agree with some other reviewers, that the sea-creature episode was the best, and seemed to have the most interesting bits.",3,"Entertaining, good info",1283040000,"08 29, 2010",2010,1088,"['Definitely', 'aimed', 'armchair', 'paleontologist', ""n't"", 'always', 'make', 'clear', 'what', 'pure', 'theory', 'what', 'known', 'think', 'most', 'viewers', 'would', 'probably', 'understand', 'just', 'everything', 'know', 'dinosaurs', 'conjecture', 'narration', 'text', 'could', 'be', 'bit', 'more', 'precise', 'experience', 'observation', 'have', 'helped', 'make', 'lot', 'sense', 'jumble', 'fossilized', 'Dinosaur', 'bones', 'behavior', 'course', 'not', 'fossilize', 'Everything', 'believe', 'know', 'creatures', 'extrapolated', 'bone', 'desposits', 'observation', 'very', 'distant', 'living', 'dino', 'relatives.The', 'effects', 'are', 'pretty', 'decent', ""n't"", 'take', 'sharp', 'eye', 'realize', 'much', 'animation', 'was', 'cannibalized', 'other', 'shows', 'said', 'was', 'already', 'aware', 'much', 'information', 'given', 'so', ""'re"", 'experienced', 'sort', 'thing', 'have', 'done', 'lot', 'reading/research', 'own', 'likely', 'not', 'much', 'series.I', 'do', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'sea-creature', 'episode', 'was', 'best', 'seemed', 'have', 'most', 'interesting', 'bits']",N/A

Each program is basically the same as the next, and since the individual shows are very repetitive (showing the same scenes and making the same statements over and over again), you're going to snooze after a while.

They were informative, entertaining & have much re-watch value. The only reason that this dvd set is getting 4 stars and not a full five is that there is an episode missing from the series. According to the packaging, there are supposed to be episodes about the following animlas: Terror Bird, Mosasaur, Spinosaurus, Acrocanthosaurus, Megalania & the Bear Faced Dog. The Bear Faced Dog episode is absent from the DVDs. Now granted they included a bonus documentary called ""What Killed the Mega Beasts"" and it was also very good, but what about The Bear Faced Dog? What the Hell? I just really wish that episode had come with the set. I hope that Discovery Channel will release another DVD set with more Mega Beastepisodes and that the Bear Faced Dog will be included.
