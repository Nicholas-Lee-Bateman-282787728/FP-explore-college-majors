939690,A2PYMYL11MW8N5,B000BBOUAE,Aaron Wooldridge,"[1, 1]","This is a truly frightening portrayal of a clash of world views that can scarcely end any way but violently. 95% of the movie focuses on a group of extremely dangerous Christian extremists who promote (and sometimes participate in) the murder of medical professionals who perform abortions. However I thought my fellow Unitarian Universalists out there would be interested to know that the remaining 5% of the movie is about the good guys - a UU church that speaks out against the Army of God.This film is a must-see, just don't expect it to put you in a good mood. This is NOT a good film for encouraging interfaith dialogue. This is a film about an irreconcilable clash of values and where the battle-lines are drawn. You will be pissed off and depressed when the movie is over.",4,Fundy extremists vs Unitarian Universalists,1314576000,"08 29, 2011",2011,780,"['truly', 'frightening', 'portrayal', 'clash', 'world', 'views', 'can', 'scarcely', 'end', 'way', 'violently', '95', '%', 'movie', 'group', 'extremely', 'dangerous', 'Christian', 'extremists', 'who', 'promote', 'sometimes', 'participate', 'murder', 'medical', 'professionals', 'who', 'perform', 'abortions', 'However', 'thought', 'fellow', 'Unitarian', 'out', 'there', 'would', 'be', 'interested', 'know', 'remaining', '5', '%', 'movie', 'good', 'guys', 'UU', 'church', 'out', 'Army', 'God.This', 'film', 'must-see', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'put', 'good', 'mood', 'NOT', 'good', 'film', 'encouraging', 'interfaith', 'dialogue', 'film', 'irreconcilable', 'clash', 'values', 'where', 'battle-lines', 'are', 'drawn', 'will', 'be', 'pissed', 'off', 'depressed', 'when', 'movie']",Soldiers in the Army of God

This film is an excellent exploration into how people, driven by the urge to ""do good"", commit horrible acts of violence(in other words: evil).  The utter hypocrisy of their actions is breathtaking, if not ironic, as they  condemn individuals they deem ""murderers"" while martyring people who murderer for their cause.

939692,AYYEKLSAZ07Y1,B000BBOUAE,Karlis Streips,"[12, 16]","I was slack-jawed during most of this excellently produced documentary, in which men (almost entirely men) discuss breaking the law in pursuit of their crazed ""Christian"" agenda.  There were a couple of things which struck me particularly hard.  First of all, again I say that almost all of these aborto-terrorists are men.  It seems that none of them has ever been pregnant or had to deal with the emotions of keeping or getting rid of a pregnancy.  What the hell are they doing in the debate?  Second, the men all appeared to be completely sans women -- the lead loony said that God told him to stay away from women altogether.  That's a convenient way of saying ""I don't think any woman would be crazed enough to come anywhere near me"".  He also announced that on God's orders, he circumcized himself, ""and I'm probably the only one who's done that and isn't insane.""  Now there's a wee bit of self-delusion.  He is insane, and he is such an excellent representative of how crazed semi-fascists have taken over the Christian church in America.  What a sad thing that is in a democracy.  What a sad, sad thing, but thanks to the people who produced this documentary, which should open up many, many eyes.",5,Absolutely terrifying,1178236800,"05 4, 2007",2007,1206,"['was', 'slack-jawed', 'most', 'excellently', 'produced', 'documentary', 'men', 'almost', 'entirely', 'men', 'discuss', 'breaking', 'law', 'pursuit', 'crazed', 'Christian', 'agenda', 'were', 'couple', 'things', 'struck', 'particularly', 'hard', 'First', 'all', 'again', 'say', 'almost', 'aborto-terrorists', 'are', 'men', 'none', 'ever', 'been', 'pregnant', 'had', 'deal', 'emotions', 'keeping', 'getting', 'rid', 'pregnancy', 'What', 'hell', 'are', 'doing', 'debate', 'Second', 'men', 'appeared', 'be', 'completely', 'sans', 'women', 'lead', 'loony', 'said', 'God', 'told', 'stay', 'away', 'women', 'altogether', 'convenient', 'way', 'saying', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'woman', 'would', 'be', 'crazed', 'enough', 'come', 'anywhere', 'also', 'announced', 'God', 'orders', 'circumcized', ""'m"", 'probably', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'done', ""n't"", 'insane', 'Now', 'wee', 'bit', 'self-delusion', 'insane', 'such', 'excellent', 'representative', 'how', 'crazed', 'semi-fascists', 'have', 'taken', 'over', 'Christian', 'church', 'America', 'What', 'sad', 'thing', 'democracy', 'What', 'sad', 'sad', 'thing', 'thanks', 'people', 'who', 'produced', 'documentary', 'should', 'open', 'up', 'many', 'many', 'eyes']",Soldiers in the Army of God

939695,A1TK6WNUIAEQRU,B000BBOUAE,stoic,"[3, 3]","Soldiers in the Army of God is a fascinating look at anti-abortion activists who believe that it is OK to murder abortion providers. These extremists can be fascinating. What is like to believe in a cause strongly enough to kill for it? What if God ""tells"" someone to commit murder? Soldiers of God forces viewers to consider these questions.The ""soldiers"" in this video are almost all men. They all say that they respect women. But viewers may wonder after hearing activists Neal Horsley and Bob Lokey discuss what they perceive to be women's role.Where do extremists come from? One of the film's best sub-plots involves an earnest young man (Jonathan O'Toole) who becomes involved in the Army of God. Viewers see Lokey and Horsley ""coach"" the O'Toole - and viewers wonder whether he is destined to become the movement's next martyr. (The DVD extras contain an interesting update on O'Toole).This film gives viewers little cause for hope. Unlike most political issues, abortion does not lend itself well to compromise. At the end, the viewer feels that the anger over abortion is likely to continue.I highly recommend Soldiers in the Army of God to anyone interested in the abortion debate or political extremism. Viewers come away with food for thought.",4,The pursuit of truth does not permit violence on one's opponent. - Mohandas Gandhi,1276473600,"06 14, 2010",2010,1255,"['Soldiers', 'Army', 'God', 'fascinating', 'look', 'anti-abortion', 'activists', 'who', 'believe', 'OK', 'murder', 'abortion', 'providers', 'extremists', 'can', 'be', 'fascinating', 'What', 'believe', 'cause', 'strongly', 'enough', 'kill', 'What', 'God', 'tells', 'someone', 'commit', 'murder', 'Soldiers', 'God', 'forces', 'viewers', 'consider', 'questions.The', 'soldiers', 'video', 'are', 'almost', 'men', 'say', 'respect', 'women', 'viewers', 'may', 'wonder', 'hearing', 'activists', 'Neal', 'Horsley', 'Bob', 'Lokey', 'what', 'perceive', 'be', 'women', 'role.Where', 'do', 'extremists', 'come', 'One', 'film', 'best', 'sub-plots', 'earnest', 'young', 'man', 'Jonathan', ""O'Toole"", 'who', 'involved', 'Army', 'God', 'Viewers', 'see', 'Lokey', 'Horsley', 'coach', ""O'Toole"", 'viewers', 'wonder', 'destined', 'become', 'movement', 'next', 'martyr', 'DVD', 'extras', 'contain', 'interesting', 'update', ""O'Toole"", '.This', 'film', 'viewers', 'little', 'cause', 'hope', 'most', 'political', 'issues', 'abortion', 'not', 'lend', 'well', 'compromise', 'end', 'viewer', 'feels', 'anger', 'abortion', 'likely', 'continue.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Soldiers', 'Army', 'God', 'anyone', 'interested', 'abortion', 'debate', 'political', 'extremism', 'Viewers', 'come', 'away', 'food', 'thought']",Soldiers in the Army of God
