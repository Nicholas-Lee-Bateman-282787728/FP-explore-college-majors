Sadly, the show could not live up to the high expectations in season 2 and 3. The story was just too weird and too extreme in my opinion with a lot of unnecessary characters (Johnny etc). Surprisingly, as some guys noted before, the show recovered nicely in its fourth season, though not quite as good as the first one. The show regained its good sense of humor and relationships were, for most part, more credible than in the previous two seaons.I think Autumn Reeser does a pretty good job taking the co-lead female role, showing some very good acting skills. I have to admit really convincing performance. I could have well imagined her for further seasons of the O.C.What I can still not understand is how it got cancelled. Ok, granted, season 2 and 3 were not too exciting. Still, it seems like the few TV shows that are worth watching get cancelled too soon. And others, without naming them, are running for the 10th season or something.

While much of the focus from this season did in fact revolve around light humor, this was also much of the reason I give the fourth season such a low rating.  Nothing really important happened until the final three episodes (mainly the earthquake) and that's not enough to give any high scores to a once really good show.However, the final 10 minutes of the very last episode was REALLY good.  Everything from those final moments were spectacular.  I won't give anything away, but it was simply beautiful, sad, and happy all wrapped in one.  The best ending I've ever seen for a show, perhaps.  I'm glad Fox gave the OC a proper ending.  So many times, with so many shows, it doesn't happen that way.I think as far as bringing together loose storyline points, they did a nice job of wrapping everything up.  Every one of the main characters was featured in the final episode to give the viewer a proper and logical goodbye.

Season 4 was cut short by Fox and as a result the show suffered in its last 5 to 8 episodes, but really pulled through with an emotional and uplifting series finale. Just keep in mind the season 3 finale is actually the real final episode (cause in essence the show has always been tragic) and Season 4 is the epilogue - its basically to just follow up what happened in that season.

I was surprised that the last season only had bout 16 episodes since the other seasons had about 27 or so each. Either way, the season started a little slow.  It starts with 5 months later after the 3rd season finale and shows how everyone is coping after the tragedy in which the 3rd season ended.  I think Taylor (Autumn Reese) saved this final season.  She did an excellent job at being bright, funny, scheming and somehow was always there to save the day. I loved her and Ryan together.The only thing I hated about this season is that every couple became and on again off again couple...even Julie Cooper couldn't make up her mind who she wanted to be with.  They had us guessing the whole season.They brought Marissa's little sister back to the show, Kaitlyn, but her scenes weren't worth watching. I kept fastforwarding every time she came on.

It took me a little longer to get into it, but once I got into I really enjoyed the show. The characters are great and the drama/humor mix makes this show a lot of fun. This season for me continued the same feeling at the third season. It was good and interesting, but it didn't have the same laid back fun feeling of the first (and most of the second season). I gave this season three stars because there were a few episodes that were too far out there for me. Also because I enjoyed watching it but it didn't keep me as invovled and keep my interest as well as the past seasons have.

1057595,A254A6HH0Z4CW0,B000NJXG6I,Geneva,"[3, 4]","I must say, this was probably the best season yet. Of course, it was pretty much an entirely different show, seeing as how the characters were no longer in high school, and it just went in an entirely different direction than the previous seasons (it reminded me of 90210 after they had all graduated high school, and the cast was almost an entirely different group of people) but it was, in all honestly, the first season where all the characters were actually likeable. The only downside being that some of the episodes were extremely corny (come on, the christmas episode was completely ridiculous)And Ok, I know a lot of people will probably hate me for saying this, but I was kind of happy that Marissa was gone, and I was interested to see what the show would be like without her. I've always had an extreme love/hate relationship with her character. Ill admit, that in some ways, the show really wasn't as good without her on it, and at times I missed her, but at the same time it was a big relief, and a much needed change with the depature of her character.I'm sorry, but it was always the same old story with Marissa. Every season, she whined and cried about how hard her life was, and always, ALWAYS there was some guy that would fall in love with her, come between her and ryan (think oliver and johnny!), and Marissa, the ditz that she was, would always deny it, even though everyone told her different and it was extremely annoying. I really don't know why ryan kept going back to her to be honest!But don't get me wrong, she wasnt the only character that I disliked.Summer (although I love her now)was extremely annoying in both the first and second season. In the first season she was annoyingly ditzy, and completely different than the summer you see in later seasons. the entire love-triangle between summer, seth, and anna during season one was extremely irritating.Need I even mention Oliver, who was, and probably always will be, the most annoying character I've ever seen on a TV show.Then in season two you have the extremely dull Zach, who bought nothing of interest to any of the storylines, and of course there was Jess, the character you wanted to just reach through the screen and bitch slap.Ryan was irritating, just for the mere fact that all during the first three seasons, he did nothing but get in fights with people. I actually lost count of how many fights he got into during season one alone!Julie Cooper was also a highly despicable character, especially during season one. She came to grow on me as her character changed little by little, until she finally became a great character in  season 3, and especially during the 4th season. You can't help but be touched as you watch her grieve over the loss of her daughter, yet you also can't help but feel bad for kaitlin, the daughter she ignores.Seth is the only character I've actually liked during all four seasons. The show definitely wouldn't have lasted as long as it did without the humor you get from his character.Another good thing was Taylors transformation, from being one of the most annoying characters ever on the show (I despised her during season 3), to becoming an actual likeable character. During this season I found her to be quite funny, and found myself actually coming to appreciate her presence.I think my favorite character of them all is Kaitlin Cooper, who is as different from Marissa as day and night. The only thing I didn't understand was why they didn't show her, along with the rest of the characters, grieving over the loss of her sister. You get no emotion from her whatsoever on that particular issue, which is extremely odd.All in all, the fourth season is one I would definitely recommend. The first episode is briliant. Even my mom, who has never liked the show, was impressed with the way they did the first episode. Everything from the characters grieving, to the music they play, is nothing short of amazing.I believe that the show could have gone on even longer than it did, atleast for a season or two more, but nevertheless, I was satisified with the series finale, as well as the rest of season 4.",5,I must admit this season brought me much relief,1211068800,"05 18, 2008",2008,4129,"['must', 'say', 'was', 'probably', 'best', 'season', 'yet', 'course', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'entirely', 'different', 'show', 'seeing', 'how', 'characters', 'were', 'no', 'longer', 'high', 'school', 'just', 'went', 'entirely', 'different', 'direction', 'previous', 'seasons', 'reminded', '90210', 'had', 'graduated', 'high', 'school', 'cast', 'was', 'almost', 'entirely', 'different', 'group', 'people', 'was', 'honestly', 'first', 'season', 'where', 'characters', 'were', 'actually', 'likeable', 'only', 'downside', 'being', 'episodes', 'were', 'extremely', 'corny', 'come', 'christmas', 'episode', 'was', 'completely', 'ridiculous', 'Ok', 'know', 'lot', 'people', 'will', 'probably', 'hate', 'saying', 'was', 'kind', 'happy', 'Marissa', 'was', 'gone', 'was', 'interested', 'see', 'what', 'show', 'would', 'be', ""'ve"", 'always', 'had', 'extreme', 'love/hate', 'relationship', 'character', 'Ill', 'admit', 'ways', 'show', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'times', 'missed', 'same', 'time', 'was', 'big', 'relief', 'much', 'needed', 'change', 'depature', 'character.I', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'was', 'always', 'same', 'old', 'story', 'Marissa', 'Every', 'season', 'whined', 'cried', 'how', 'hard', 'life', 'was', 'always', 'ALWAYS', 'was', 'guy', 'would', 'fall', 'love', 'come', 'ryan', 'think', 'oliver', 'johnny', 'Marissa', 'ditz', 'was', 'would', 'always', 'deny', 'even', 'everyone', 'told', 'different', 'was', 'extremely', 'annoying', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'ryan', 'kept', 'going', 'back', 'be', 'honest', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'wasnt', 'only', 'character', 'disliked.Summer', 'love', 'now', 'was', 'extremely', 'annoying', 'first', 'second', 'season', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'annoyingly', 'ditzy', 'completely', 'different', 'summer', 'see', 'later', 'seasons', 'entire', 'love-triangle', 'summer', 'seth', 'anna', 'season', 'one', 'was', 'extremely', 'irritating.Need', 'even', 'mention', 'Oliver', 'who', 'was', 'probably', 'always', 'will', 'be', 'most', 'annoying', 'character', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'TV', 'show.Then', 'season', 'two', 'have', 'extremely', 'dull', 'Zach', 'who', 'bought', 'nothing', 'interest', 'storylines', 'course', 'was', 'Jess', 'character', 'wanted', 'just', 'reach', 'screen', 'bitch', 'slap.Ryan', 'was', 'irritating', 'just', 'mere', 'fact', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'did', 'nothing', 'get', 'fights', 'people', 'actually', 'lost', 'count', 'how', 'many', 'fights', 'got', 'season', 'one', 'alone', 'Julie', 'Cooper', 'was', 'also', 'highly', 'despicable', 'character', 'especially', 'season', 'one', 'came', 'grow', 'character', 'changed', 'little', 'little', 'finally', 'became', 'great', 'character', 'season', '3', 'especially', '4th', 'season', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'touched', 'watch', 'grieve', 'loss', 'daughter', 'also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'bad', 'kaitlin', 'daughter', 'only', 'character', ""'ve"", 'actually', 'liked', 'four', 'seasons', 'show', 'definitely', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'lasted', 'as', 'long', 'did', 'humor', 'get', 'character.Another', 'good', 'thing', 'was', 'Taylors', 'transformation', 'being', 'one', 'most', 'annoying', 'characters', 'ever', 'show', 'despised', 'season', '3', 'becoming', 'actual', 'likeable', 'character', 'season', 'found', 'be', 'quite', 'funny', 'found', 'actually', 'coming', 'appreciate', 'presence.I', 'think', 'favorite', 'character', 'Kaitlin', 'Cooper', 'who', 'as', 'different', 'Marissa', 'day', 'night', 'only', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'was', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'rest', 'characters', 'grieving', 'loss', 'sister', 'get', 'emotion', 'whatsoever', 'particular', 'issue', 'extremely', 'odd.All', 'fourth', 'season', 'one', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'first', 'episode', 'briliant', 'Even', 'mom', 'who', 'never', 'liked', 'show', 'was', 'impressed', 'way', 'did', 'first', 'episode', 'Everything', 'characters', 'grieving', 'music', 'play', 'nothing', 'short', 'amazing.I', 'believe', 'show', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'even', 'longer', 'did', 'atleast', 'season', 'two', 'more', 'nevertheless', 'was', 'satisified', 'series', 'finale', 'as', 'well', 'rest', 'season', '4']",The O.C.: Season 4

It started out, and pretty much remained, a good show. I didn't watch many episodes on TV, though, because I had to work nights. My sister watched them, though, so I was pretty glad when I heard that they were being released on DVD.My sister was able to buy the first season. I bought her the next two. No, I'm not big on watching shows that were released almost a year old, but it's what I had to do.Sometimes I noticed repeating themes or storylines that were very similar to ones that had been used before. But, they were able to tell the stories tongue-in-cheek, and usually made jokes about storylines being repetitive. I rather liked how each episode never came to a completely satisfying conclusion. Something would be left open. Seth & Summer might break up while Ryan & Marissa begin to get back together, while Sandy discovers his wife has a drinking problem, meanwhile Julie Cooper is working a scam.Marissa's death at the end of Season 3 will go down in history as the episode that almost (almost) moved me to tears.I liked that at the beginning of Season 4 they would have to restructure everything. Having moved out from my parent's house, I knew the show restructuring itself it was a lot like growing up. While ratings may have made THE O.C. close, it seemed like it was time. Kaitlin and her friends just could not replace the Fantastic Four's (meaning Ryan, Seth, the late Marissa, and Summer, not the Marvel superheroes) appeal. The FF had grown up. It was time for the show to close.I was able to see how the last episode ended. It was just perfect, though I would've liked to have seen some definite hint that Ryan and Taylor (who replaced Marissa only as becoming a main character and becoming a new love interest for Ryan, I'm glad they didn't try to turn her into Marrissa) would go further than dating. And the final scene with Ryan seeing the kid was just perfect. ""Do unto others."" Just finally showing what may happen because of something similar done back in the first episode.My sister or I are definitely buying this.

I never viewed season one when it originally aired, I did see an episode here & there but I didn't really get hooked until I got the first season as a birthday present two years ago. I still watch it!! I've enjoyed every season. Lots of viewers like to compare the seasons, which one was the best & which one was the worst. All I can say is that I've enjoyed all the seasons & I've enjoyed watching the characters grow & seeing relationships end & others begin. It's truly a very well written, well casted series. The music, the sets, the clothes & the characters mostly are amazing. I did miss that Marissa isn't in this season & I was very upset when I found out that they killed her off but it was enjoyeable seeing where the show went after that happened & it was something very real that people have to face & deal with everyday. The cast did amazing in season four of portraying the greif & loss of just losing a best friend, soulmate & daughter. Marissa was my favorite character & I missed her but I enjoyed getting to know other characters better this season such as Taylor & Katelyn. Taylor really lit up the show & kinda shed some light during a very dark situation. Autumn Reeser is amazing!! I've only viewed disc one so far but once I finish the entire season, I'll update my review. I'd also have to say that the packaging & artwork are perfect as usual. Also, I got my copy at Target where they are selling a limited edition of season four. It's 5$ more but it's worth it. You get a bonus disc of special features which is over an hour long.

1057603,A2XAGLR8VDOU6T,B000NJXG6I,"Joshua Spaulding ""Television God""","[3, 5]","With the death of Marissa Cooper bringing to an end the third season of The O.C., things certainly had to swing upward with the start of the fourth season. While the first few episodes of what turned out to be the final season of this addictive primetime soap opera were a little sluggish, the rest of the season was a return to the glory of season one, albeit a little too late to salvage the show.Coming into season four, it was likely that this would be the last season for the show, one of my favorites and midway through the season it was announced that the show would conclude after 16 episodes. The announcement did give creator Josh Schwartz enough time to pen a great ending, one that wrapped the series up in a nice bow and presented it to the fans who had been with the show since day one.But starting the season was tough, as it was six months after Marissa was killed in a traffic accident caused by bad boy Volchok. Ryan (Ben McKenzie) is still traumatized over the death of the girl who had changed his life, and as we open the season, he is working in a seedy bar and cage fighting. But, he has connections with Marissa's mom, Julie Cooper (Melinda Clarke), who reaches out to him when her private investigator finds out where Volchok is located.Ryan's distance is hard on Sandy (Peter Gallagher) and Kirsten Cohen (Kelly Rowan), as they struggle with watching their adopted ""son"" fall on hard times. In the first few episodes, Ryan is finally convinced to come home to Newport Beach and begin mending his life and his heart.The early part of the season takes viewers on a trip to Mexico as Ryan and Seth (Adam Brody) look for Volchok south of the border. Sandy and Kirsten follow and eventually, Volchok turns himself in, with Sandy's help, keeping Ryan from going off the deep end and killing him as he truly wanted to do. Sandy's act not only helps Volchok, but helps Ryan stay out of trouble and on the right side of the law.From there, the season picks up and returns to the soapy drama and humor that made it such a hit in the first season. This season truly found the groove again, thanks in part to a great casting move, one that anybody watching season three would've found hard to believe.The show runners brought in Taylor Townsend (the gorgeous Autumn Reeser) in season three, seemingly as a foil for the main characters. While she was only a guest star during that season, the new season finds her among the regular stars in the opening credits and her addition to the full time cast was a blessing. She truly brought a lot of the  humor that the show needed. Taylor has been away in France in college for the six months since graduation and returns to California with a wedding ring and a need to escape her French husband, Henri-Michel. She finds her reason in Ryan, though their relationship takes some great twists and turns along the way. Ryan trying to express his feelings for Taylor is pretty funny and when Henri-Michel comes to Newport to woo Taylor back to France, it becomes obvious that he has feelings for her even if he can't completely express them.The relationship with Taylor is Ryan's main story throughout the season, as he is still having a hard time letting go of the memory of Marissa and can't commit to Taylor the way she wants. Watching him struggle to figure out what he is feeling provides a good dose of humor.Summer (the beautiful Rachel Bilson) has spent her first semester at Brown University where she has undergone major changes. Instead of the Newport girl that left Seth, she is now an environmental activist, wreaking havoc on the Rhode Island campus with her new friend Che (guest star Chris Pratt, who is hilarious in this role). When she gets kicked out of school for setting rabbits free from their cages, she returns to Newport and has to face the fact that her best friend is gone, something she had been putting on a back page during her activist stage.Seth is working in a comic book store, leaving long messages on Summer's answering machine, longing for the days when he had Ryan and Summer to keep him company in Newport. He soon gets both of them back and things seem to return to ""normal"" for Seth despite the fact that Summer has obviously changed.Julie and Kirsten continue as business partners in New Match, a high-end dating service that Julie turns into a male prostitution ring, temporarily ruining her friendship with Kirsten. It is through this business that Julie meets Gordon Bullitt (guest star Gary Grubbs) and Ryan's father, Frank Atwood (guest star Kevin Sorbo). Unable to decide, Julie dates both men, unable to make a choice in her life, despite the best efforts of her daughter Kaitlin (Willa Holland) to get her to choose the wealthy Bullitt.The return of Ryan's father also brings trouble, much like the return of his mother and brother in previous seasons. Frank has been in jail and initially, Ryan wants nothing to do with him, but Frank lies to get Ryan to see him and the two slowly begin to mend the fences that came down quickly in the past. Ryan even helps Frank on the Julie front, teaming with Taylor to form ""Team Frank.""Sandy and Kirsten get a major surprise on Kirsten's 40th birthday, as she reveals she is pregnant and instead of having an empty nest, the couple will be welcoming a new baby, though both parents cringe at the thought of raising another kid in Newport.Perhaps the highlight of the season was the Chrismukkah episode, where Ryan and Taylor fall off a ladder and end up in an alternate Newport, where Sandy is mayor and married to Julie, Kirsten is still working at the Newport Group and married to Jimmy Cooper (guest star Tate Donovan), Seth is still a geek and Summer is marrying Che (or Chester as he's known in the alternate world). This episode allowed the stars to play different characters for a while and was pretty funny to watch.The final few episodes wrap the series up very nicely. An earthquake rattles Orange County, putting everyone in danger and it is revealed that the Cohen house has been destroyed. This leads Ryan and Seth on a mission to Berkeley to try and purchase Sandy and Kirsten's first house even as a pregnant (with Frank's kid) Julie prepares to marry Bullitt (and yes, he knows). Sandy and Kirsten fly to Berkeley and end up having the baby in their old house, prompting Julie and Bullitt to move the wedding there as well, eventually convincing the new owners to sell the house to Sandy and Kirsten.The final few minutes glimpses into the future of the characters, looking at what Ryan, Summer, Seth, Sandy, Kirsten, Julie, Kaitlin and the whole group is up to. It is a great way to end, with everyone seemingly in a good place, just where you might hope they'd be.This set also has some good extras, which add to the release. Schwartz provides commentary on the series finale and it is well done and informative. There is a couple of good featurettes, one on the creation of Seth's holiday blend, Chrismukkah and another on the evolution of the Summer character, focusing on her transformation from Newport Barbie to well-rounded young woman. Her character did go through possibly the most changes throughout the four-year history of the show.All told, the season wrapped up well, surely leaving viewers pleased and as a big fan of the show, I think this DVD set did a great job presenting the final 16 episodes.",5,"The end's not near, it's here",1182816000,"06 26, 2007",2007,7374,"['death', 'Marissa', 'Cooper', 'bringing', 'end', 'third',

The plot lines were dumber and crazier than anything in Seth's 'Atomic County' comic book.  I think the writers knew the show was cancelled and decided to drop any pretense at serious drama and go for cartoon laughs.  Taylor Townsend had no redeeming qualities, yet she became a leading character and love interest for Ryan, who lost his noble and heroic edge.  Summer became a silly activist and acted like Seth's squabbling sibling.  Julie became involved with a  billionaire buffoon and Ryan's once-loathsome-now-good-guy father, and her suddenly-15-year old daughter Kaitlin went from unlikable delinquent to selfless daughter and true friend.It's all too much and insulting to loyal fans who loved the show since it's wonderful first season.

It just doesn't work.Add to that the fact that many of the characters are at least ten years older than the characters they are playing. I don't know if any of you noticed it, but Adam Brody started looking really old here (hes in his late 20s) and the role just did not work. The actor seemed really tired.Benjamin McKenzie is exactly ten years older than the character he plays here, and the fourth season is when I totally lost any love I may have had for this character. The actor just got very weak - and the performances are, dare I say it, strange.Pity, because despite being a show that perhaps had one of the greatest seasons in TV History (Season 1), Season 4 seems like an afterthought.

It's a good season, it just feels like a different show. With the death of their best friend Marissa, Ryan, Seth and Summer must cope with the tragedy. Julie is affected greatly also. Let me say that the third season finale with Marissa's death TOTALLY shocked me. I couldn't even believe that it was happening...literally. I don't understand why they had to kill her. I mean, why her? She was awesome! But if you loved her also, you will be affected by the emotion of this season.Everyone's trying to deal with her death and it really upsets you as a viewer. The dialogue is sometimes heartbreaking, and even being a guy it is really sad. Taylor becomes a main character this season and having her and Ryan have a serious relationship is kind of upsetting. I guess he has to move on and everything...but I mean come on, Marissa is his girl and will always be his girl. They were soul mates. I mean really, on TV dramas like this, you usually know who's gonna end up with who. Before Marissa died, you totally thought that by the series finale they would be together. But in this case no. Some of the relationships are kind of disappointing (Julie-Frank, Taylor-Ryan). I like Julie and Frank and all...but it just doesn't seem like The O.C. It feels like they were pushing it a little.That being said, this season is really good and has really good episodes, all good storylines. The best episode this season is The Cold Turkey. It's really sad and really affects you if Marissa was your favorite character.P.S. I still can't believe The O.C. is over. It was described as such a ""phenomenon.""

But it was healthy that they did come back, tie up the loose ends and give a credible finale to the lives of our heroes in Newport, as they go their separate - and sometimes a little unexpected -  ways.Tonally, the series starts off incredibly bleak as Ryan reaches an all time low, Summer and Seth have yet another problem placed in their path to eternal romance and even Sandy and Kirsten have some surprises in store... however, a few episodes in the tone changes radically.  New characters are brought in, and it looks scarily like they are setting us up for The OC: The New Generation... and it sits very badly.  Kaitlin, Marissa's younger sister is at first an annoying jailbait version of Marissa, but to give the writers credit she really becomes a fleshed out character in quite a short time.  However, her hangers-on at school seem squarely pitched at a younger audience, as do a few of her storylines.  Her mother's new boyfriends also take on a sillier bent than they have in the past, reaching a nadir with Bullit the oilman.  Even the otherwise starworthy performance from Rachel Bilson as Summer Roberts is blighted by a juvenile ecowarrior companion.  Thankfully, he fades away as the season progresses.These sillier elements get the season off to a bumpy start and knock off a star from the season - but from there it gets better as the elements that have made the show a success are reintroduced.  Summer Roberts (Rachel Bilson) has really come into her own and her relationship with Seth reaches interesting new places.  The drama inherent in growing up and leaving home adds new energy to the show, and even the at-first-annoying Taylor plotline with Ryan helps get away from the ever repeating will-they won't-they episodes that blighted the third season to some extent.The final episode is a disappointment for most of it, going deliberately far off the rails to start off with, in order to gain audience support when they put it all right again.. however, it does seem like largely a wasted opportunity... until the last 5 minutes, when the tearful farewells to homes and between characters should tug at the heartstrings of longtime fans.So it is an odd mix of 1 star moments and 5 star moments but it all comes out right in the final mix.  None of the show reaches any deep intellectual places, but for fans of the hyper-reality of sun, sexy teens, rich Californian surfing town and soap opera story lines with a dose of issues of the day - Season 4 is no disaster, and not one to miss if you have seen the rest of the series.

I guess because of the crash in the ratings - partly because of Grey's Anatomy - the writers thought they had to take the series in a new, direction, and so they turned the series into a farce.Let me back up a bit. I loved the start of the 4th season, the conflict of Ryan trying to find Volchok, but once Volchok turned himself in there was no central, compelling conflict to propel the action. Instead there was an endless parade of comedy, most of which I didn't think worked.Again we were introduced to more unbelievable characters: Che and Bullit that made me groan.Yes, it was nice to see Kaitlin and Taylor grow, but I still found Taylor somewhat annoying and unrealistic.Sandy Cohen became more of a spectator than someone taking part in the action. I don't know why he wasn't given a stronger, dramatic storyline. For exammple, now that he was back in the Public Defender's office, why couldn't he have a new, compelling client, perhaps a young woman who shares a bond with Ryan?I liked the way Summer and Julie evolved for the better.Finally, I loved the way the series ended. (Yes, I had tears in my eyes.) Afterward, I listened to Josh Schwart'z commentary, and heard him say he was definately going for comedy in season 4. I suspect he forgot that one of the things that made the O.C. so addicting was the way it went back and forth from comedy to drama. Also, I rewatched the pilot. It was a compelling, dramatic episode that got the series off to a bang - viewers loved it and became addicted to the show - and yet the pilot wasn't that funny.IMHO, what sunk the OC was a bad, first half of the 3rd season, where we were introduced to several unlikeable characters and unbelievable storylines.I suspect is the writers of The OC never figured out where they lost their way.Anyway, that's my two cents. It's certainly a lot easier criticizing a series than writing one.Thanks Josh and everyone else who worked on the show for some great tv!",2,The Series Lost Its Way,1243382400,"05 27, 2009",2009,2007,"['Many', 'people', 'loved', '4th', 'season', 'was', 'disappointed', 'guess', 'crash', 'ratings', 'partly', 'Grey', 'Anatomy', 'writers', 'thought', 'had', 'take', 'series', 'new', 'direction', 'so', 'turned', 'series', 'farce.Let', 'back', 'up', 'bit', 'loved', 'start', '4th', 'season', 'conflict', 'Ryan', 'trying', 'find', 'Volchok', 'once', 'Volchok', 'turned', 'was', 'central', 'compelling', 'conflict', 'propel', 'action', 'Instead', 'was', 'endless', 'parade', 'comedy', 'most', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'were', 'introduced', 'more', 'unbelievable', 'characters', 'Che', 'Bullit', 'made', 'groan.Yes', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'Kaitlin', 'Taylor', 'grow', 'still', 'found', 'Taylor', 'somewhat', 'annoying', 'unrealistic.Sandy', 'Cohen', 'became', 'more', 'spectator', 'someone', 'taking', 'part', 'action', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'given', 'stronger', 'dramatic', 'storyline', 'exammple', 'now', 'was', 'back', 'Public', 'Defender', 'office', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'new', 'compelling', 'client', 'perhaps', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'shares', 'bond', 'Ryan', 'liked', 'way', 'Summer', 'Julie', 'evolved', 'better.Finally', 'loved', 'way', 'series', 'ended', 'Yes', 'had', 'tears', 'eyes', 'Afterward', 'listened', 'Josh', 'Schwart', 'z', 'commentary', 'heard', 'say', 'was', 'definately', 'going', 'comedy', 'season', '4', 'suspect', 'forgot', 'one', 'things', 'made', 'O.C', 'so', 'addicting', 'was', 'way', 'went', 'back', 'forth', 'comedy', 'drama', 'Also', 'rewatched', 'pilot', 'was', 'compelling', 'dramatic', 'episode', 'got', 'series', 'bang', 'viewers', 'loved', 'became', 'addicted', 'show', 'yet', 'pilot', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny.IMHO', 'what', 'sunk', 'OC', 'was', 'bad', 'first', 'half', '3rd', 'season', 'where', 'were', 'introduced', 'several', 'unlikeable', 'characters', 'unbelievable', 'storylines.I', 'suspect', 'writers', 'OC', 'never', 'figured', 'out', 'where', 'lost', 'way.Anyway', 'two', 'cents', 'certainly', 'lot', 'easier', 'criticizing', 'series', 'writing', 'one.Thanks', 'Josh', 'everyone', 'else', 'who', 'worked', 'show', 'great', 'tv']",The O.C.: Season 4
1057613,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000NJXG6I,Robert Moore,"[28, 33]","I deeply regret both that FOX didn't order a slate of episodes for THE O.C.'s final season and even more strongly regret that they cancelled it when it still had a lot of life left in it.  Season Three had been a thudding disappointment that both chased off a lot of previous fans and made FOX consider ending it.  The network never really gave it a chance in its final season, putting it in a timeslot in which it couldn't possible maintain strong ratings.  Nonetheless, after the dismal third season, it was great to see the series regain the charm that had made it so much fun to watch in its first and most of its second season.One of the reasons for the success of the show in the fourth season is that they finally seemed to realize that the endless number of hated characters that popped up over the years were simply that:  hated.  They were not characters we loved to hate, we simply didn't like them.  It all started with Oliver and then mushroomed in the next two seasons, exploding in Season Three.  But this year they managed to avoid introducing any truly awful characters.  I never really warmed up to Ch&eacute; and Taylor's French ex-husband was not very likable, but neither approached the loathsome characters of the first two season.  Instead, we were left mainly with the same characters that were the real reasons we enjoyed the show all along.I must admit that at first I was leery about the reappearance of Taylor and Kaitlin.  The latter in Season Three seemed to be on the verge of being as self-destructive as Marissa had been.  With Marissa gone I was certain that Kaitlin was going to go down her path.  Instead, the writers took her character in a number of unexpected ways and she ended up being a delightful character.  But even more shocking was what they did with Taylor.  Even in Season Three they had done a great deal to redeem her character.  Taylor had started out as one of the least likable characters on the show, but they gradually made her sympathetic.  Still, at the end of Season Three she at most could be described as irritating.  This year they managed to make her actually likable.  And by the time that we realized that they were actually going to have her and Ryan get together I had actually warmed to her.  She was still high strung and obsessive, but she was also shown to be someone with a large heart.  And in a way that Marissa never was, she turned out to be good for Ryan.All in all, the show had a good four-year run.  I think it had another year or two in it and would have enjoyed seeing it come back.  But given how terrible Season Three was, I must confess that my overwhelming feeling about Season Four was gratitude.  The most abused and meaningless phrase in talking about television is ""jumped the shark.""  If any show ever had truly jumped the shark, that was THE O.C. in Season Three.  But Season Four was a wonderful return to form.  I'm not sure that any other show ever had such a terrible year and then followed it with such a great one.  So it ended, but at least it ended well.  Not many series can make that claim.",5,A surprisingly strong rebound for a series that still had some life in it,1176163200,"04 10, 2007",2007,3092,"['deeply', 'regret', 'FOX', 'did', ""n't"", 'order', 'slate', 'episodes', 'O.C', 'final', 'season', 'even', 'more', 'strongly', 'regret', 'cancelled', 'when', 'still', 'had', 'lot', 'life', 'left', 'Season', 'Three', 'had', 'been', 'thudding', 'disappointment', 'chased', 'off', 'lot', 'previous', 'fans', 'made', 'FOX', 'consider', 'ending', 'network', 'never', 'really', 'gave', 'chance', 'final', 'season', 'putting', 'timeslot', 'could', ""n't"", 'possible', 'maintain', 'strong', 'ratings', 'Nonetheless', 'dismal', 'third', 'season', 'was', 'great', 'see', 'series', 'regain', 'charm', 'had', 'made', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'watch', 'first', 'most', 'second', 'season.One', 'reasons', 'success', 'show', 'fourth', 'season', 'finally', 'seemed', 'realize', 'endless', 'number', 'hated', 'characters', 'popped', 'up', 'years', 'were', 'simply', 'hated', 'were', 'not', 'characters', 'loved', 'hate', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'started', 'Oliver', 'then', 'mushroomed', 'next', 'two', 'seasons', 'exploding', 'Season', 'Three', 'year', 'managed', 'avoid', 'introducing', 'truly', 'awful', 'characters', 'never', 'really', 'warmed', 'up', 'Ch', 'eacute', 'Taylor', 'French', 'ex-husband', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'likable', 'neither', 'approached', 'loathsome', 'characters', 'first', 'two', 'season', 'Instead', 'were', 'left', 'mainly', 'same', 'characters', 'were', 'real', 'reasons', 'enjoyed', 'show', 'along.I', 'must', 'admit', 'first', 'was', 'leery', 'reappearance', 'Taylor', 'Kaitlin', 'latter', 'Season', 'Three', 'seemed', 'be', 'verge', 'being', 'as', 'self-destructive', 'Marissa', 'had', 'been', 'Marissa', 'gone', 'was', 'certain', 'Kaitlin', 'was', 'going', 'go', 'down', 'path', 'Instead', 'writers', 'took', 'character', 'number', 'unexpected', 'ways', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'delightful', 'character', 'even', 'more', 'shocking', 'was', 'what', 'did', 'Taylor', 'Even', 'Season', 'Three', 'had', 'done', 'great', 'deal', 'redeem', 'character', 'Taylor', 'had', 'started', 'out', 'one', 'least', 'likable', 'characters', 'show', 'gradually', 'made', 'sympathetic', 'Still', 'end', 'Season', 'Three', 'most', 'could', 'be', 'described', 'irritating', 'year', 'managed', 'make', 'actually', 'likable', 'time', 'realized', 'were', 'actually', 'going', 'have', 'Ryan', 'get', 'together', 'had', 'actually', 'warmed', 'was', 'still', 'high', 'strung', 'obsessive', 'was', 'also', 'shown', 'be', 'someone', 'large', 'heart', 'way', 'Marissa', 'never', 'was', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'good', 'Ryan.All', 'show', 'had', 'good', 'four-year', 'run', 'think', 'had', 'year', 'two', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'come', 'back', 'given', 'how', 'terrible', 'Season', 'Three', 'was', 'must', 'confess', 'overwhelming', 'feeling', 'Season', 'Four', 'was', 'gratitude', 'most', 'abused', 'meaningless', 'phrase', 'talking', 'television', 'jumped', 'shark', 'show', 'ever', 'had', 'truly', 'jumped', 'shark', 'was', 'O.C', 'Season', 'Three', 'Season', 'Four', 'was', 'wonderful', 'return', 'form', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'other', 'show', 'ever', 'had', 'such', 'terrible', 'year', 'then', 'followed', 'great', 'one', 'ended', 'least', 'ended', 'well', 'Not', 'many', 'series', 'can', 'make', 'claim']",The O.C.: Season 4

It had been a rocky road for the series and the characters over the 4-years that `The OC' aired on the FOX network, but through it all the series persisted.The theme of season 4 was essentially `going back to the beginning' and that was exactly what happened in this final season.  Since all the main characters either died or graduated high school in the third season finale, the four season premier seemed more like a pilot than a season finale of a show near its end.  And for 15 additional episodes the writers brought the humor, wackiness, and pop cultural refrences that made the series so popular to begin with back, leaving the melodrama at a bare minimum.I'm sad to see `the OC' go, it will always be a part of my history because for better or for worse I watched the show through every-one of its 94 episodes, and I will remember these characters fondly.  I also need to mention the series finale, which to my amazement didn't dissapoint in the least, it was lighthearted, fun, zany, and had all the right ingredients, and definitely worth a rental if you just want to see how the series comes to a close.This DVD set contains all 16-episodes on 5 discs, in additional to deleted Scenes, Gag Reel, 2 Featurettes, as well as a commentary on the final episode, `The end is not Near, it's Here'",5,"Now Leaving 'The OC', B*tch",1172188800,"02 23, 2007",2007,1402,"['final', '16', 'episodes', 'once', 'pop-cultural', 'phenomenon', 'OC', 'finally', 'white', 'had', 'been', 'rocky', 'road', 'series', 'characters', '4-years', 'OC', 'aired', 'FOX', 'network', 'series', 'persisted.The', 'theme', 'season', '4', 'was', 'essentially', 'going', 'back', 'beginning', 'was', 'exactly', 'what', 'happened', 'final', 'season', 'main', 'characters', 'died', 'graduated', 'high', 'school', 'third', 'season', 'finale', 'four', 'season', 'premier', 'seemed', 'more', 'pilot', 'season', 'finale', 'show', 'end', '15', 'additional', 'episodes', 'writers', 'brought', 'humor', 'wackiness', 'pop', 'cultural', 'refrences', 'made', 'series', 'so', 'popular', 'begin', 'back', 'leaving', 'melodrama', 'bare', 'minimum.I', ""'m"", 'sad', 'see', 'OC', 'go', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'part', 'history', 'better', 'worse', 'watched', 'show', 'every-one', '94', 'episodes', 'will', 'remember', 'characters', 'fondly', 'also', 'need', 'mention', 'series', 'finale', 'amazement', 'did', ""n't"", 'dissapoint', 'least', 'was', 'lighthearted', 'fun', 'zany', 'had', 'right', 'ingredients', 'definitely', 'rental', 'just', 'want', 'see', 'how', 'series', 'close.This', 'DVD', 'set', '16-episodes', '5', 'discs', 'additional', 'deleted', 'Scenes', 'Gag', 'Reel', '2', 'Featurettes', 'as', 'well', 'commentary', 'final', 'episode', 'end', 'not', 'Near', 'Here']",The O.C.: Season 4
