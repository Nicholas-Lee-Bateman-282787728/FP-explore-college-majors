The songs are pleasant (even if some of the lyrics are strained) and the animal muppets are friendly and non-threatening. My grandson goes right to sleep after one of the songs is played two or three times -- and after a while you will know them all so well that you can sing them to your baby yourself.

1299139,A34BONVNM07TRG,B002YE26MA,Webmama,"[2, 2]",My toddler son just loves the Pajanimals!  This DVD is watched every night and it just lulls him right to sleep.  He loves the songs and this keeps his attention 100%.  I even allow him to watch it before nap time too and this is the icing on the cake to a wonderful sleepy time!  I even play this DVD when he happens to wake in the middle of the night and is of need of a little encouragement to go back to sleep!  I have to say that I don't agree with some reviews that says that this DVD does not sound like the Pajanimals because these are the same sounding characters that my son has grown to love from the Sprout channel.  No complaints here except that I wish that they made more DVDs at this time but for now he and I will have to wait until more comes out.,5,Apart of Bedtime Rituals!,1348099200,"09 20, 2012",2012,765,"['toddler', 'son', 'just', 'Pajanimals', 'DVD', 'watched', 'night', 'just', 'right', 'sleep', 'songs', 'attention', '100', '%', 'even', 'allow', 'watch', 'nap', 'time', 'too', 'icing', 'cake', 'wonderful', 'sleepy', 'time', 'even', 'play', 'DVD', 'when', 'wake', 'middle', 'night', 'need', 'little', 'encouragement', 'go', 'back', 'sleep', 'have', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'reviews', 'DVD', 'not', 'sound', 'Pajanimals', 'are', 'same', 'sounding', 'characters', 'son', 'grown', 'love', 'Sprout', 'channel', 'No', 'complaints', 'here', 'wish', 'made', 'more', 'DVDs', 'time', 'now', 'will', 'have', 'wait', 'more', 'out']","Pajanimals: Good Night, Pajanimals!"
