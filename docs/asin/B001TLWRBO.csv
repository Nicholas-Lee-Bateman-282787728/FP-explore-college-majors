1236840,A3GPL5JEP3G1VS,B001TLWRBO,Hmph,"[0, 0]","Ghajini is a great movie, with an excellent story! The acting is well done too, and most of the songs sound beautiful (my favorite is ""Guzarish""). Something that happened towards the end of the movie was completely unrealistic...I don't want to spoil that part for you, but I'm just letting you know. However, that scene didn't ruin the movie for me, and I still loved Ghajini.And by the way, I've seen Memento. This movie is NOT a play-by-play remake of Memento*. It's true that in both films, the men have a special type of amnesia, they're after their significant other's murderer, and they take Polaroid photos to remember situations. But the plot is otherwise completely different. Memento is a thriller and Ghajini is full of action and romance. The romance in this movie is actually really sweet, and I don't say that about most romantic movies.*Ghajini is, however, a remake of a movie with the same name released in Tamil, another Indian language.

Not only is he ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS but he's such a gifted actor.  He makes you feel Sanjay's grief but also makes you laugh and go ""awwww"" in the scenes recounting Sanjay's relationship with Kalpana.  Asin, who plays Kaplana is great in this movie as well.

1236845,A290A3XO7XK33X,B001TLWRBO,Prominence,"[9, 11]","For so long I have wanted to review Ghajini, each time I put it off because I just cannot seem to find the right words to put down that would do justice to this movie. In one word, WOW! I have seen this movie 15 billion times (ok, tongue in cheek), no but for real I have seen it so many times I lost count. The 3 hours go by so fast for a weekend watch and I have the movie divided into mental sections that I watch every night until the movie is finished, only to start all over. Ghajini makes me laugh until my ribs ache and cry too. Oh and did I mention how my jaw drops at the last 15 minutes of the movie.I'm sure you're aching to get to the cr&egrave;me of the crop, so I'll make it easy. A quick warning though, this is in no way the Hindi version of the movie Memento! The only thing the two movies have in common would be a protagonist with short term memory loss who carries a Polaroid camera with him everywhere to keep new memory, along with tattooed messages all over his body. Oh and I suppose they both share the loss of a loved one. Besides these, the two movies couldn't be any farther apart.The movie starts out with a group of curious medical students looking for a real life case for their capstone project. They find one that seems really interesting, but are told it's a police case, which means they cannot study it, hence the opening into the life of Sanjay Singhania, the bald guy with scars running in different directions on his head. The sheer rage at which this guy murders his victim seems unrealistic and definitely uncalled-for. I found myself wincing as I watched these scenes. Anyway, one thing leads to the other, cops trail the murder evidence up to Sanjay's apartment and that's when we get a look at Sanjay's diary. The diary opens with the photograph of a remarkably good-looking man, which makes you wonder how such beauty is transformed into the monster we've seen so far. It is this story that made me laugh and cry. One thing it doesn't leave me with is the same wonder at if the rage in the opening is warranted or not. I'll let you be the judge of that since this is my opinion.Aamir Khan is a delight to watch as always. He keeps getting better and looking fabulous. I love the song Guzarish so much but I'd only listen to the audio (and skip it in the actual movie) because Aamir is so fine and he shows off his bod so well (in the right places too!) that it makes a woman's head spin out of control...sigh. Yeah, so I skip it just so I'm not harboring some thoughts if you know what I mean :D ...  Asin, absolutely gorgeous lady, she fits in Kalpana's  role so well, as a matter of opinion, fitting so well might be an understatement. Check out her reaction when she couldn't find someone to double for her ""fianc&eacute;e"" at her company's New Year party (don't want to give too much away).  Or the first time she tells Sanjay how she met her ""fianc&eacute;e"". This is the part where I crack up so bad.The only thing that I kept saying ""Nah...not possible to"" was the stylized fight sequence especially at the end of the movie. I kept thinking ""Short term memory loss doesn't make one the Terminator, or does it?"" Well, I enjoy the movie enough to overlook this. Seriously, have fun watching this movie, it's worth the watch.",5,"Hi, I'm Sanjay Singhania",1242950400,"05 22, 2009",2009,3275,"['so', 'long', 'have', 'wanted', 'review', 'Ghajini', 'time', 'put', 'off', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'seem', 'find', 'right', 'words', 'put', 'down', 'would', 'do', 'justice', 'movie', 'one', 'word', 'WOW', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', '15', 'billion', 'times', 'ok', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'real', 'have', 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'lost', 'count', '3', 'hours', 'go', 'so', 'fast', 'weekend', 'watch', 'have', 'movie', 'divided', 'mental', 'sections', 'watch', 'night', 'movie', 'finished', 'only', 'start', 'over', 'Ghajini', 'ribs', 'ache', 'cry', 'too', 'Oh', 'did', 'mention', 'how', 'jaw', 'drops', 'last', '15', 'minutes', 'movie.I', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'re"", 'aching', 'get', 'cr', 'egrave', 'crop', ""'ll"", 'make', 'easy', 'quick', 'warning', 'way', 'Hindi', 'version', 'movie', 'Memento', 'only', 'thing', 'two', 'movies', 'have', 'common', 'would', 'be', 'protagonist', 'short', 'term', 'memory', 'loss', 'who', 'Polaroid', 'camera', 'everywhere', 'keep', 'new', 'memory', 'tattooed', 'messages', 'body', 'Oh', 'suppose', 'share', 'loss', 'loved', 'one', 'two', 'movies', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'farther', 'apart.The', 'movie', 'out', 'group', 'curious', 'medical', 'students', 'looking', 'real', 'life', 'case', 'capstone', 'project', 'find', 'one', 'really', 'interesting', 'are', 'told', 'police', 'case', 'can', 'not', 'study', 'hence', 'opening', 'life', 'Sanjay', 'Singhania', 'bald', 'guy', 'scars', 'running', 'different', 'directions', 'head', 'sheer', 'rage', 'guy', 'victim', 'unrealistic', 'definitely', 'uncalled-for', 'found', 'wincing', 'watched', 'scenes', 'Anyway', 'one', 'thing', 'other', 'cops', 'trail', 'murder', 'evidence', 'up', 'Sanjay', 'apartment', 'when', 'get', 'look', 'Sanjay', 'diary', 'diary', 'opens', 'photograph', 'remarkably', 'good-looking', 'man', 'wonder', 'how', 'such', 'beauty', 'transformed', 'monster', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'far', 'story', 'made', 'laugh', 'cry', 'One', 'thing', ""n't"", 'leave', 'same', 'wonder', 'rage', 'opening', 'warranted', 'not', ""'ll"", 'let', 'be', 'judge', 'opinion.Aamir', 'Khan', 'delight', 'watch', 'always', 'getting', 'better', 'looking', 'fabulous', 'love', 'song', 'Guzarish', 'so', 'much', ""'d"", 'only', 'listen', 'audio', 'skip', 'actual', 'movie', 'Aamir', 'so', 'fine', 'bod', 'so', 'well', 'right', 'places', 'too', 'woman', 'head', 'spin', 'control', 'sigh', 'Yeah', 'skip', 'just', 'so', ""'m"", 'not', 'harboring', 'thoughts', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'D', 'Asin', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'lady', 'Kalpana', 'role', 'so', 'well', 'matter', 'opinion', 'fitting', 'so', 'well', 'might', 'be', 'understatement', 'Check', 'out', 'reaction', 'when', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'someone', 'double', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'company', 'New', 'Year', 'party', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'first', 'time', 'Sanjay', 'how', 'met', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'part', 'where', 'crack', 'up', 'so', 'only', 'thing', 'kept', 'saying', 'Nah', 'not', 'possible', 'was', 'stylized', 'fight', 'sequence', 'especially', 'end', 'movie', 'kept', 'thinking', 'Short', 'term', 'memory', 'loss', ""n't"", 'make', 'one', 'Terminator', 'Well', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'enough', 'overlook', 'Seriously', 'have', 'fun', 'watching', 'movie', 'watch']",Ghajini
