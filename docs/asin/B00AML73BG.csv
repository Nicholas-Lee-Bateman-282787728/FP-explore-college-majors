Marvin runs the show from his little studio, and it is interesting to see the crime story's through jailhouse, police, and victims interviews. They also do reenactments using these people, so while the acting isn't the best, it's still fun to watch. The picture quaility varies, but considering that they dug these out of the archives, I find it to be pretty good. I also like that they tour the major US cities, so you can get cross-section of crime and law enforcement techniques during this time period.",5,Unique Program,1364688000,"03 31, 2013",2013,660,"['found', 'program', 'be', 'unique', 'being', 'made', 'early', '60', 'color', 'used', 'actual', 'party', 'involved', 'crimes', 'when', 'possible', 'Marvin', 'show', 'little', 'studio', 'interesting', 'see', 'crime', 'story', 'jailhouse', 'police', 'victims', 'interviews', 'also', 'do', 'reenactments', 'using', 'people', 'so', 'acting', ""n't"", 'best', 'still', 'fun', 'watch', 'picture', 'quaility', 'varies', 'considering', 'dug', 'archives', 'find', 'be', 'pretty', 'good', 'also', 'like', 'tour', 'major', 'US', 'cities', 'can', 'get', 'cross-section', 'crime', 'law', 'enforcement', 'techniques', 'time', 'period']",Lawbreaker - Lee Marvin Presents

I thought it was a show in the same vein as Lee Marvin's M-Squad series. But this show is different! You might say it was a precurser to today's reality shows. Using real crime stories with theactual people involved. Featuring a different story from both major & minor citiesacross America during the 1960s. A sort of time capsule look into just how the problem of urban and youth crimewas. And still is today 60 years later!PS. It is also a look into just how awful looking 60s fashions were.

It is NOT a docudrama, but Marvin introduces you to the people actually involved in the case, & the acting parts usually include the actual people involved in the case, thus, the acting is usually pretty TERRIBLE (& that's being nice).

1613371,A10RGJ0NVVGODV,B00AML73BG,Ron Wise,"[40, 43]","Timeless Media Group (TMG) will soon be releasing yet another great, nearly-forgotten television series that hasn't seen the light of day in fifty years. Well, fifty years is long enough to wait for this television gold mine.After legendary actor Lee Marvin appeared in the TV crime classic ""M Squad"" and in numerous motion pictures, he decided to delve into another television series. This time he was the host of a syndicated series that first aired during the 1963-64 season. That series was titled ""Lee Marvin Presents: The Lawbreakers."" (also known as just ""Lawbreaker""), produced by United Artist Television.There were a total of 32 episodes, each being 25 minutes long without commercials. All 32 episodes are included in this collection. One thing that is not known at this point is whether this collection will be in color or black and white. It seems that the series was filmed in color, and some cities' local television stations broadcast the series in color, while others broadcast it in black and white. In 1963, there were few color sets in homes, although those numbers were increasing at a large rate annually thanks to ""Bonanza"" and ""Walt Disney Presents,"" both early color series.Also, filming a series in color for future color broadcast was not a new concept.  The last three seasons of  ""The Adventures of Superman"" were filmed in color, and all episodes of ""The Cisco Kid"" were filmed in color. Some TV markets with the equipment to broadcast in color in the 1950's and early 1960's did so to attract a wider audience and achieve higher ratings.*UPDATE* There is a ""Lawbreaker"" trailer on the Timeless Media Group website that is in color. The colors are somewhat faded and the picture quality is not in a ""restored"" condition, but there is a good possibility that the ""Lawbreaker"" episodes will be presented in color as the producers intended.As for ""Lee Marvin Presents: The Lawbreakers,"" this series was filmed documentary style with all stories carefully based on true police situations, oftentimes featuring the actual police personnel involved and the procedures and techniques used.  This real-life footage is edited in with recreated scenes, much like the reality crime shows of today.While some of the episodes involved murders, robberies, and kidnappings, there were also plenty of other stories that focused on other areas of law enforcement. In fact, each featured city's law enforcement agency in the series was allowed to select a true crime story that it wanted to be told.Here are a few sample episodes: ""The Miami Story"" is about the Miami police racing against the clock to find a bomb hidden in a synagogue; ""The Milwaukee Story"" tells of the Milwaukee police searching for a female gang of armed robbers; ""The Burbank Story"" is about Burbank police efforts to save a young boy who has fallen over a cliff; and ""The Dallas Story"" is about the Dallas police attempting to end a hostage-taking situation.TMG is currently offering several other series from television's ""Golden Age"" that are anthology series with episodes based on true events. They are: ""West Point,"" ""The Lawless Years,"" and ""State Trooper"" and they are all excellent entertainment.So if you are a Lee Marvin fan and you like your vintage television series with a lot of fast-paced action based on true events, then ""Lee Marvin Presents: The Lawbreakers"" may be just what the forensic scientist ordered. If we keep supporting companies like TMG, Shout! Factory, TGG, Image, and others then, hopefully, they will keep releasing these wonderful old series from American television's rich past.",5,"""Lee Marvin Presents: The Lawbreakers,"" another cool series from TMG",1358640000,"01 20, 2013",2013,3599,"['Timeless', 'Media', 'Group', 'TMG', 'will', 'soon', 'be', 'releasing', 'yet', 'great', 'nearly-forgotten', 'television', 'series', ""n't"", 'seen', 'light', 'day', 'fifty', 'years', 'Well', 'fifty', 'years', 'long', 'enough', 'wait', 'television', 'gold', 'mine.After', 'legendary', 'actor', 'Lee', 'Marvin', 'appeared', 'TV', 'crime', 'classic', 'M', 'Squad', 'numerous', 'motion', 'pictures', 'decided', 'delve', 'television', 'series', 'time', 'was', 'host', 'syndicated', 'series', 'first', 'aired', '1963-64', 'season', 'series', 'was', 'titled', 'Lee', 'Marvin', 'Presents', 'Lawbreakers', 'also', 'known', 'as', 'just', 'Lawbreaker', 'produced', 'United', 'Artist', 'Television.There', 'were', 'total', '32', 'episodes', 'being', '25', 'minutes', 'long', 'commercials', '32', 'episodes', 'are', 'included', 'collection', 'One', 'thing', 'not', 'known', 'point', 'collection', 'will', 'be', 'color', 'black', 'white', 'series', 'was', 'filmed', 'color', 'cities', 'local', 'television', 'stations', 'broadcast', 'series', 'color', 'others', 'broadcast', 'black', 'white', '1963', 'were', 'few', 'color', 'sets', 'homes', 'numbers', 'were', 'increasing', 'large', 'rate', 'annually', 'Bonanza', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Presents', 'early', 'color', 'series.Also', 'filming', 'series', 'color', 'future', 'color', 'broadcast', 'was', 'not', 'new', 'concept', 'last', 'three', 'seasons', 'Adventures', 'Superman', 'were', 'filmed', 'color', 'episodes', 'Cisco', 'Kid', 'were', 'filmed', 'color', 'TV', 'markets', 'equipment', 'broadcast', 'color', '1950', 'early', '1960', 'did', 'so', 'attract', 'wider', 'audience', 'achieve', 'higher', 'ratings', '*UPDATE*', 'Lawbreaker', 'trailer', 'Timeless', 'Media', 'Group', 'website', 'color', 'colors', 'are', 'somewhat', 'faded', 'picture', 'quality', 'not', 'restored', 'condition', 'good', 'possibility', 'Lawbreaker', 'episodes', 'will', 'be', 'presented', 'color', 'producers', 'intended.As', 'Lee', 'Marvin', 'Presents', 'Lawbreakers', 'series', 'was', 'filmed', 'documentary', 'style', 'stories', 'carefully', 'based', 'true', 'police', 'situations', 'oftentimes', 'featuring', 'actual', 'police', 'personnel', 'involved', 'procedures', 'techniques', 'used', 'real-life', 'footage', 'edited', 'recreated', 'scenes', 'much', 'reality', 'crime', 'shows', 'today.While', 'episodes', 'involved', 'murders', 'robberies', 'kidnappings', 'were', 'also', 'plenty', 'other', 'stories', 'focused', 'other', 'areas', 'law', 'enforcement', 'fact', 'featured', 'city', 'law', 'enforcement', 'agency', 'series', 'was', 'allowed', 'select', 'true', 'crime', 'story', 'wanted', 'be', 'are', 'few', 'sample', 'episodes', 'Miami', 'Story', 'Miami', 'police', 'racing', 'clock', 'find', 'bomb', 'hidden', 'synagogue', 'Milwaukee', 'Story', 'tells', 'Milwaukee', 'police', 'searching', 'female', 'gang', 'armed', 'robbers', 'Burbank', 'Story', 'Burbank', 'police', 'efforts', 'save', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'fallen', 'cliff', 'Dallas', 'Story', 'Dallas', 'police', 'attempting', 'end', 'hostage-taking', 'situation.TMG', 'currently', 'offering', 'several', 'other', 'series', 'television', 'Golden', 'Age', 'are', 'anthology', 'series', 'episodes', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'are', 'West', 'Point', 'Lawless', 'Years', 'State', 'Trooper', 'are', 'excellent', 'entertainment.So', 'are', 'Lee', 'Marvin', 'fan', 'vintage', 'television', 'series', 'lot', 'fast-paced', 'action', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'then', 'Lee', 'Marvin', 'Presents', 'Lawbreakers', 'may', 'be', 'just', 'what', 'forensic', 'scientist', 'ordered', 'keep', 'supporting', 'companies', 'TMG', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'TGG', 'Image', 'others', 'then', 'hopefully', 'will', 'keep', 'releasing', 'wonderful', 'old', 'series', 'American', 'television', 'rich', 'past']",Lawbreaker - Lee Marvin Presents
