898932,A3G7W5O2OX8MTC,B0008FPIQ8,"Grey ""b09boy""","[2, 2]","It starts up well enough.  We get more insight into the character Z, who is genuinely entertaining though seen extremely little.  From there we get to see a rather unnecessary set of flashbacks of the series which might've been fine if the voicework had been done well.  As it is, it only takes up episode space.  Aside from that, however, the first episode is pretty good.  Funny, though the girls have a disturbing lack of interaction with Tenchi.  And at the end of the episode there's an emotional shocker which could really set up for something good.From there it all goes downhill.  New characters are introduced like mad, leaving all the main ones, aside from Tenchi, Washu and Ryo-ohki, in the background.  This is made all the more annoying by a few things.  All the new characters (aside from the one introduced at the end of the first episode) are overblown and annoying.  To make it worse, they have this freakish and instant attraction to Tenchi not seen anwhere else in the series (despite many of their relations to him).  One in particular, the third woman introduced, seems completely unnecessary to the series and makes little sense being there.  The fourth, on the other hand, is annoyingly perfect.  Like Sakuya except with a temper against Mihoshi.  And worse, we get most of the third episode devoted to her.  Then of course we hear about (but aren't introduced to) Seto, the devil princess of Jurai, who even the Emperor Azusa doesn't mess with and even Kagato avoided at all costs.  :/  Considering the cast we've been introduced to and those two characters, that screams fanfiction to me more than OVA.On the other hand the girls we know are glazed over.  Washu and Ryo-ohki are best off, retaining ample screen time and the same personalities we know and love, though Washu seems more social than I remember.  Sasami is not far behind, retaining her innocent playfulness and hard-working attitude whenever possible, though her relationship with Tsunami is never touched on in the least. Mihoshi and her antics are largely ignored, given background screen time every once and awhile and little more.  Ayeka and Ryoko suffer most, though.  As much screen time as they are given, it is largely as the two jealous girls arguing with each other (no fighting).  With Ayeka it's easy to forget she's the first princess of the most powerful (politically) family in the universe, she gets so little time outside of jealousy and Ryoko arguments.  For all that, however, Ryoko has it even worse.  She starts off well enough in the first episode, but by the second it's like looking at a different character.  For instance, in none of the three episode does she once give a hint of a flirt to Tenchi.  Besides that, she's incredibly mild and cowardly in the face of intimidation.  It's funny at first, with her fear toward Misaki, but it quickly gets out of hand, her backing down to the new characters as if they had any sort of authority or power over her (she's gotten hit and screamed at worse with Ayeka, Washu or Misaki more than these characters combined and she's still cowering away).  The absolute worst for me, however (and this is a spoiler, so you've been warned) is how she just sort of accepts that Tenchi has a fiance because the devil princess arranged it.  That goes against everything we've seen of Ryoko up to this point in any of the series.The voice acting is alright.  I only had a problem with Tenchi, whose voice is constantly breaking, and the last two additions to the cast, whose voices are as annoying and unreal as their personalities.  Everyone else is good (aside from the shoddy flashback scenes) including Ryoko's new voice which, though different, makes a pretty good replica to the old one.  I honestly had no problem with it aside from the flashbacks.  The animation is alright as well.  It's different from the OVA, for good and for bad.  It's smoother, but also goes into the crazier anime tendencies as well.Overall, this is failed potential.  Very sad and disappointing.  I'm hoping this will get resolved in later episodes, but I hold little hope.",2,Convoluted.,1171670400,"02 17, 2007",2007,4103,"['up', 'well', 'enough', 'get', 'more', 'insight', 'character', 'Z', 'who', 'genuinely', 'entertaining', 'seen', 'extremely', 'little', 'get', 'see', 'rather', 'unnecessary', 'set', 'flashbacks', 'series', 'might', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fine', 'voicework', 'had', 'been', 'done', 'well', 'only', 'up', 'episode', 'space', 'Aside', 'however', 'first', 'episode', 'pretty', 'good', 'Funny', 'girls', 'have', 'disturbing', 'lack', 'interaction', 'Tenchi', 'end', 'episode', 'emotional', 'shocker', 'could', 'really', 'set', 'up', 'something', 'good.From', 'downhill', 'New', 'characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'mad', 'leaving', 'main', 'ones', 'aside', 'Tenchi', 'Washu', 'Ryo-ohki', 'background', 'made', 'more', 'annoying', 'few', 'things', 'new', 'characters', 'aside', 'one', 'introduced', 'end', 'first', 'episode', 'are', 'overblown', 'annoying', 'make', 'worse', 'have', 'freakish', 'instant', 'attraction', 'Tenchi', 'not', 'seen', 'anwhere', 'else', 'series', 'many', 'relations', 'One', 'particular', 'third', 'woman', 'introduced', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'series', 'little', 'sense', 'being', 'there', 'fourth', 'other', 'hand', 'annoyingly', 'perfect', 'Sakuya', 'temper', 'Mihoshi', 'worse', 'get', 'most', 'third', 'episode', 'devoted', 'Then', 'course', 'hear', 'are', ""n't"", 'introduced', 'Seto', 'devil', 'princess', 'Jurai', 'who', 'even', 'Emperor', 'Azusa', ""n't"", 'mess', 'even', 'Kagato', 'avoided', 'costs', '/', 'Considering', 'cast', ""'ve"", 'been', 'introduced', 'two', 'characters', 'screams', 'fanfiction', 'more', 'OVA.On', 'other', 'hand', 'girls', 'know', 'are', 'glazed', 'Washu', 'Ryo-ohki', 'are', 'best', 'off', 'retaining', 'ample', 'screen', 'time', 'same', 'know', 'love', 'Washu', 'more', 'social', 'remember', 'Sasami', 'not', 'far', 'retaining', 'innocent', 'playfulness', 'hard-working', 'attitude', 'whenever', 'possible', 'relationship', 'Tsunami', 'never', 'touched', 'least', 'Mihoshi', 'antics', 'are', 'largely', 'ignored', 'given', 'screen', 'time', 'once', 'awhile', 'little', 'more', 'Ayeka', 'Ryoko', 'suffer', 'most', 'though', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'are', 'given', 'largely', 'two', 'jealous', 'girls', 'arguing', 'other', 'fighting', 'Ayeka', 'easy', 'forget', 'first', 'princess', 'most', 'powerful', 'politically', 'family', 'universe', 'so', 'little', 'time', 'jealousy', 'Ryoko', 'arguments', 'however', 'Ryoko', 'even', 'worse', 'off', 'well', 'enough', 'first', 'episode', 'second', 'looking', 'different', 'character', 'instance', 'none', 'three', 'episode', 'once', 'give', 'hint', 'flirt', 'Tenchi', 'incredibly', 'mild', 'cowardly', 'face', 'intimidation', 'funny', 'first', 'fear', 'Misaki', 'quickly', 'hand', 'backing', 'down', 'new', 'characters', 'had', 'sort', 'authority', 'power', 'gotten', 'hit', 'screamed', 'worse', 'Ayeka', 'Washu', 'Misaki', 'more', 'characters', 'combined', 'still', 'cowering', 'away', 'absolute', 'worst', 'however', 'spoiler', ""'ve"", 'been', 'warned', 'how', 'just', 'sort', 'accepts', 'Tenchi', 'fiance', 'devil', 'princess', 'arranged', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Ryoko', 'up', 'point', 'series.The', 'voice', 'acting', 'alright', 'only', 'had', 'problem', 'Tenchi', 'voice', 'constantly', 'breaking', 'last', 'two', 'additions', 'cast', 'voices', 'are', 'annoying', 'unreal', 'personalities', 'Everyone', 'else', 'good', 'aside', 'shoddy', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'including', 'Ryoko', 'new', 'voice', 'different', 'pretty', 'good', 'replica', 'old', 'one', 'honestly', 'had', 'problem', 'aside', 'flashbacks', 'animation', 'alright', 'as', 'well', 'different', 'OVA', 'good', 'bad', 'smoother', 'also', 'crazier', 'anime', 'tendencies', 'well.Overall', 'failed', 'potential', 'Very', 'sad', 'disappointing', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'will', 'get', 'resolved', 'later', 'episodes', 'hold', 'little', 'hope']",Tenchi Muyo!

898933,A2S56SO002IE21,B0008FPIQ8,"J. A. Dispensa ""The original Mistress Ryoko *...","[2, 2]","I'm a HUGE TM! fan, I'm talkin' everything bit of merchandise ever made regarding this little anime saga, I own it.  So naturally when the new OVA came out, I just had to have it, despite what some critics said about it...Now, first off, I have to say that I was more than a bit unrattled when I heard that Petrea Burchard (sometimes credited as Celeste Burch) was no longer providing the voice of Ryoko, however I figured that I didn't mind as long as she didn't sound like the voice actress that did Ryoko's voice in GXP.  Boy was I in for a shock...Let's put it this way...Ryoko's beautifully sultry voice has been replaced by a nasally, whiny sub-par 'Giget'.  I'd equate it almost like the voice actress who did Yuzuha in 'Daughter of Darkness', only a little more squeaky.  It didn't do Ryoko's character justice at all, and truth be told, it took all the self-control I had to keep from jamming Q-tips in my ears.  Long gone are the days of the wonderfully deep alto undercurrents Miss Burchard had provided, the kind that made men melt into their socks, instead I felt insulted that the creators would think that a fan like myself wouldn't notice such a drastic change.  Let's face it, Ryoko's voice that we all know and love made her who she was, and it is truely sad to see (and hear) that she is gone (I won't even SPEAK of the voice overs for the flash backs!).  Don't get me wrong, I don't hate the actress, I just feel she would have made a better voice over for a character on Pokemon rather than Ryoko from TM.Everyone else seems pretty much the same, except Mihoshi sounds more like the bubbly blonde in Tenchi in Tokyo, and Washu doesn't really sound all that cheerful anymore.  'Tenchi' from time to time sounds like he's going through a growth spurt rather than the voice most of us are used to, but pretty much the same.  Tokimi's voice actress is different, but didn't really phase me.Ok, on to business...The artistry isn't the same either.  It seems more 'Tenchi in Tokyo' rather than the original OVA, but didn't take away all that much away from the experience.  I think the special effects were just a tad over done; it just didn't seem right to have to use special effects on a moving truck, but that's just me I guess.As for the series itself, it's pretty slow, as well as a bit confusing.  The first episode deals with pretty much how it left off.  We get a better look at 'Z', although his motives are still unclear.  It's a bit confusing who exactly he works for...D or Lady Tokimi.  Either way, he has compiled info regarding Tenchi and the girls and is sent on another mission: to keep an eye on Tenchi, but not to harm him.  From that point, we go back to where things ended in episode 13 of the second OVA, only some flash backs thrown into the mix.  Tenchi goes into the city to see his dad, and is met with a few of his schoolmates, who in turn inform him of Amagasaki's (the 'clown' from the first OVA episode) current situation.  After meeting with Nobuyuki and his dad's secretary/friend (are they dating?), father and son return home in the mountains, all the while Tenchi asking about his late mother (his father however dodging the most painful of them).  Later at home, it seems Ryoko has taken a more relaxed, motherly role in the way she treats Ryo-Ohki, and this seems to upset little Sasami a bit.  Things seem to go on as usual, however it isn't long before Tenchi's world is turned upside down all over again as someone drops by for a visit.The second episode deals with a few surprise relatives dropping by, all of which are female, and in the same token, all of them find Tenchi irresistably cute (who'd've thunk it?).  Most of the group is flabbergasted (can you guess who) when it's discovered that Tenchi is betrothed to a young Jurian woman, a match made possible by Princess Aeka's grandmother.  Needless to say this doesn't settle at all with Ryoko, eliciting a couple of comedic moments as the ex-pirate receives quite a punishment for calling one of Tenchi's 'long lost' relatives a ""crusty old hag"".  Oh, what will happen to Tenchi this time?In the third episode, Tenchi collapses from the stress (or so it seems) and it's up to his new fiance to take care of him (much to the displeasure of Aeka and Ryoko).  While he rests, his chosen lady rallies everyone around to help out with the everyday chores, and she seems to prove that she can handle both Lady Aeka and Ryoko quite well, not to mention Mihoshi (we all know that Kiyone wasn't part of the original series, and she isn't in this either, but this woman's nature seems to fill that void a bit).  As Tenchi recovers, Ryoko and Aeka (as well as Tenchi's grandfather) learn the truth behind this new fiance's motives.  Deep in space though, a space ship is on it's way to Earth...it's mission: to rescue Mihoshi.All in all it wasn't bad...not as exciting as the first or second OVA, but not bad.  The quality is quite good, but I felt the writing was a little forced and lacking in some areas.  Nothing too much to discourage me from watching it (but again, the voices...oh Goddess the voices!).If you're a true Tenchi fan, this disk is a must have if only to continue the set.  Other than that, it's really nothing to write home about (but that's just me).",4,TENCHI'S BACK!

Hernandez ""fromthewoods""","[0, 0]","I guess I could join the chorus of nay-sayers about the new voice of Ryoko, however change IS the only constant in the Universe. And I can only hope the voice actress can mature into the strong character that Ryoko really is supposed to be.As for the comment about Kiyone (Mihoshi's partner in the Tenchi Universe series... which has NOTHING to do with the storyline of the original 13 ep. OAV) it just reflects a lack of familiarity with the variety of Tenchi series and their intent (experiments in marketing and technique).This new series is the continuation promised at the end of the original OAV.This is the unwinding of all the questions that arise in the original.  And though it seems confusing to some it is based on a lot of ancient Japanese culture... which is what Kasijima Musaki was reflecting in the original story.The whole idea of the Three Shinto Goddesses of Nature, Waashuu, Tokimi and Tsunami of which one (Waashuu) has a 'daughter', who is of course Ryoko.  The term 'Devil' or 'Demon' is to be taken in a gollum-type sense concerning Ryoko, she is really the daughter of a Goddess and not a 'devil'.  And if you really follow the story, Kasihito (Tenchi's grandfather) son of the first wife (Funaho) of the Emperor (Azuza) and Ayeka and Sasami are the daughter of his second wife (Misaki).  So Ayeka and Sasami are Tenchi's Great Aunts.  Ayeka was to be Kasihito's wife according to royal tradition.  Being they had the same father but different mothers.  But as we see in this series, Kasihito has taken a wife previously.  Then there is the matter of Mihoshi.  According to some sources Mihoshi is related to Waashuu through the son Waashuu had with the man she became human and resigned her memory for... sound familiar all you students of mythology?  Dr. Clay was hinting that he suspected something much the same and was digging to find out what was beyond that in the  before time of that.What I am waiting to see is if all the questions that were raised are answered: Who was Tenchi's mother and what is her lineage?  Why does Kasihito not take the throne in line with the wishes of his father?  What is the Karamitsu Family madness about?  What was the origin of Waashuu's feud with her younger sister Tokimi?  Why is Tsunami on the Earth as well?  Will Tenchi in the end marry BOTH Ryoko and Ayeka and take the throne?.. What is Noike's real family line... is she related in some strange way to Tenchi?  She claims that the person she sees in her dream is Tenchi... also she is pictured with Deep3 in the beginning sequence, is he her 'brother'? OR is she a manipulation of Tokimi and Deep3 thrown into the melieu?  And what is with Mihoshi's past and the arranged marriage she underwent?  And what is with her brother (who looks a lot like Mihoshi) Misou? I WANT TO KNOW!!!!Now IF Funimation will kindly get the show on the road and distribute volume two... (ahem!) being it has been nearly a year since the release of volume one!... I guess one could just learn Japanese and get an all region DVD player and order the original Japanese series of the new OAV.

And I suffered through the lesser and more pathetic ""sequels"" - the three movies that were billed as resolving the Tenchi storyline but didn't - the last of which never even came out in Laser Disc format - and I even bought the Tenchi Universe boxed sets. And in each, the production value was less and less - even as the storyline was changed for the worse in each incarnation. And in each new series, the original storyline was ignored or abandoned and my favorite characters acted in ways that were totally out of character for them. It was like reading an ""updated"" book of fairy tales in which Snow White refuses to kiss the prince because he has bad breath, little Red Riding Hood gets a dog brush and curries the wolf, and the Big Bad Wolf rents a Bob-Cat, knocks down the brick house, and makes sushi out of the pigs. It's just not the same. I didn't even bother to watch or buy the Tenchi GPX series. You don't have to hit me in the face with a skunk three times before I realize something stinks. So, when I read that there was to be a new OVA series that would resolve the original story line, I was happy, but also a bit skeptical, as Pioneer/Genon have crushed my hopes so many times before.Inexplicably, this new series is by Funimation, and not Genon/Pioneer. The production values are excellent, and the animation is almost on a par with the original OVA, quality-wise. It is a strange mix of cell animation and computer generation animation. The storyline also ignores most of the non-cannon events that took place in the Universe series and Pretty Sammy series and the GPX series, etc.  All of the original OVA characters are back, though many with different voice actors. And they act like the characters in the original OVAs, for the most part, though the artwork doesn't match. Ayeka and Rhyoko especially look different, Rhyoko being a bit scarier and having more of an ""edge"" than she originally had. The first three episodes also pick up cues from the original OVAs - we see Tokimi, of whom Sasami had nightmares, which made her cry ""don't take Tenchi away Tokimi"", and whom we only saw as a floating goddess head in the OVA, backed up by silhouettes that looked like Tsunami and Washu but was never explained.  But the producers also throw in Tenchi's mother but really a sister he never knew about and a new fiance who is really a spy sent by the royal family to keep watch on Tenchi. They then run with these new characters, leaving the original love triangle dangling in the dust. Will this new series fulfill the promise of the original OVAs?

LaPonte ""mo""","[37, 38]","Before I even get started, I'll address what was for me, and so I assume it was for many Tenchi fans, the anxiety over the replacement English dub for Ryoko.  Mona Marshall replaces Petrea Burchard in this third OVA series.  You'll know her as both the English dub voices of Kite in the .hack games and Nataku in X.  Her voice here tries to capture Petrea's essence, but comes off as much younger.  Of course, as a long time Tenchi fan, I miss Petrea as Ryoko, but I think Mona has done a fine job, certainly better in any event, than she did for the GXP series.Most of the rest of the voice cast returned this time around, however they are all also ten years older, and a tuned ear can hear the minute differences.  Sasami was dead on with the original though, however, Sherri Lynn hasn't been out of practice using it, as she has done the same voice for numerous other anime and games over the years (most notably MOMO in Xenosaga).Now, the series as a whole is interesting.  It's the same show, only some ten years later in coming.  A lot more CG is used this time around, and most of it is very obvious and almost seems out of place.  The story picks up where it left off, and for anyone who is either unfamiliar with it or can't remember it, being that it has been so long, the first episode has quite a few flashbacks to acquaint and re-aquaint the audience with the backstory and characters.The first volume of OVA 3 deals with the arrival of Noike, an arranged fiance to Tenchi by everyone's favorite Devil Princess of Jurai, that you may remember from Tenchi GXP, Lady Seto.  Yosho's wife Airi (also from GXP) arrives, as does an unexpected relative of Tenchi.  Supposedly this new OVA series will deal more heavily with Washu, Tsunami, and the mysterious Tokimi.  For fans who were hoping that Kiyone from the Universe and Tokyo series and movies would arrive, sorry, she isn't a part of the original OVA storyline and won't be appearing (her appearance in the Mihoshi special isn't part of the OVA timeline).  However, Noike does a lot to fill that void for any lingering Kiyone fans out there (you'll just have to watch and see what I mean).  And for anyone who is confused, in the proper timeline, Kiyone is the name of Tenchi's mother.  It was changed for the first movie to Achika, to reduce confusion between herself and the other Kiyone.In any event, I highly recommend this DVD for any old Tenchi fans, as well as the GXP series for anyone who is confused about all the new characters who appear on this disc.",5,Can't wait for Volume 2 already...,1120003200,"06 29, 2005",2005,2527,"['even', 'get', 'started', ""'ll"", 'address', 'what', 'was', 'so', 'assume', 'was', 'many', 'Tenchi', 'fans', 'anxiety', 'replacement', 'English', 'dub', 'Ryoko', 'Mona', 'Marshall', 'Petrea', 'Burchard', 'third', 'OVA', 'series', ""'ll"", 'know', 'English', 'dub', 'voices', 'Kite', '.hack', 'games', 'Nataku', 'X', 'voice', 'here', 'capture', 'Petrea', 'essence', 'off', 'as', 'much', 'younger', 'course', 'long', 'time', 'Tenchi', 'fan', 'miss', 'Petrea', 'Ryoko', 'think', 'Mona', 'done', 'fine', 'job', 'certainly', 'better', 'event', 'did', 'GXP', 'series.Most', 'rest', 'voice', 'cast', 'returned', 'time', 'around', 'however', 'are', 'also', 'ten', 'years', 'older', 'tuned', 'ear', 'can', 'hear', 'minute', 'differences', 'Sasami', 'was', 'dead', 'original', 'though', 'however', 'Sherri', 'Lynn', ""n't"", 'been', 'practice', 'using', 'done', 'same', 'voice', 'numerous', 'other', 'anime', 'games', 'years', 'most', 'notably', 'MOMO', 'Xenosaga', '.Now', 'series', 'whole', 'interesting', 'same', 'show', 'only', 'ten', 'years', 'later', 'coming', 'lot', 'more', 'CG', 'used', 'time', 'most', 'very', 'obvious', 'almost', 'place', 'story', 'up', 'where', 'left', 'off', 'anyone', 'who', 'unfamiliar', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'being', 'been', 'so', 'long', 'first', 'episode', 'quite', 'few', 'flashbacks', 'acquaint', 're-aquaint', 'audience', 'backstory', 'characters.The', 'first', 'volume', 'OVA', '3', 'deals', 'arrival', 'Noike', 'arranged', 'fiance', 'Tenchi', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'Devil', 'Princess', 'Jurai', 'may', 'remember', 'Tenchi', 'GXP', 'Lady', 'Seto', 'Yosho', 'wife', 'Airi', 'also', 'GXP', 'unexpected', 'relative', 'Tenchi', 'Supposedly', 'new', 'OVA', 'series', 'will', 'deal', 'more', 'heavily', 'Washu', 'Tsunami', 'mysterious', 'Tokimi', 'fans', 'who', 'were', 'hoping', 'Kiyone', 'Universe', 'Tokyo', 'series', 'movies', 'would', 'arrive', 'sorry', ""n't"", 'part', 'original', 'OVA', 'storyline', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'appearing', 'appearance', 'Mihoshi', 'special', ""n't"", 'part', 'OVA', 'timeline', 'However', 'Noike', 'lot', 'fill', 'void', 'lingering', 'Kiyone', 'fans', 'out', 'there', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'watch', 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'anyone', 'who', 'confused', 'proper', 'timeline', 'Kiyone', 'name', 'Tenchi', 'mother', 'was', 'changed', 'first', 'movie', 'Achika', 'reduce', 'confusion', 'herself', 'other', 'Kiyone.In', 'event', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'old', 'Tenchi', 'fans', 'as', 'well', 'GXP', 'series', 'anyone', 'who', 'confused', 'new', 'characters', 'who', 'appear', 'disc']",Tenchi Muyo!

We had Tenchi in Tokyo, which was disappointing, and we had GXP, which strayed far from the original story and characters.  So this new series is a chance to finally get back into The Groove.  Does it work?Mostly, yeah.  I do have a couple of criticisms.  It's true that Ryoko doesn't sound like her old self.  It's a shame.  On the other hand, the new voice isn't as awful as I think some reviewers made it out to be.  I suppose I can live with it.I'm unhappy that this series picks up where the first OVA left off.  I think Tenchi Universe was a lot more cohesive -- it was the second and more polished draft of Tenchi's story.  I would certainly have preferred a follow-on to Tenchi Universe, rather than reverting to the OVA ideas. . .  (I cringe when anyone refers to Washu as Ryoko's mother.)  But again, I suppose I can live with it.These three episodes have other weaknesses, but in general they are the same ones Tenchi Muyo has always had -- if you're a fan already, they aren't going to turn you away from this.The disc feels short, it left me wanting more.  We get three episodes: the first has several flashbacks, and the rest are largely exposition and setting up the story, which seems like it will start to really unfold with future releases.  Therefore, it's too early to judge this series after viewing this one disc.  Still. . .  This is recognizably Tenchi Muyo, to a degree that I haven't seen for a long time.  We've got Tenchi, Ryoko, Ayeka, Washu and the rest of the gang back under one roof in the Musaki household, up to their old tricks.

They may have been bombarded by marketers and other behind the scenes tampering. Maybe this absurdly long-awaited return to the original OVA storyline was supposed to be a lot better than it was.But it was rushed, unfocused, and all but devoid of any satisfying action or comedy. Do not even buy it used; rent it if you must.This review comes too late for most of us (frankly, I tried to put the experience out of my mind), who fell in love with these characters years ago, and jumped at the chance to see them again. But by 'these characters' I don't mean the ones introduced here, who waste at least a third of this already too short 'wrap up'.If I thought it would work, I'd have tried to gather everyone together for a mass returning of DVDs to the publisher, demanding not a refund, but a return to the drawing board.After this debaccle, though, I'd almost hate to see the Masaki family subjected to any furhter indignity.",2,"It gets worse from here, not better.",1187913600,"08 24, 2007",2007,1042,"['was', 'ready', 'give', 'whole', 'series', 'one', 'star', ""'ll"", 'give', 'people', 'who', 'worked', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'bombarded', 'marketers', 'other', 'scenes', 'tampering', 'Maybe', 'absurdly', 'long-awaited', 'return', 'original', 'OVA', 'storyline', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'lot', 'better', 'was.But', 'was', 'rushed', 'unfocused', 'devoid', 'satisfying', 'action', 'comedy', 'Do', 'not', 'even', 'buy', 'used', 'rent', 'must.This', 'review', 'too', 'late', 'most', 'frankly', 'tried', 'put', 'experience', 'mind', 'who', 'fell', 'love', 'characters', 'years', 'ago', 'jumped', 'chance', 'see', 'again', ""'these"", 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'ones', 'introduced', 'here', 'who', 'waste', 'least', 'third', 'already', 'too', 'short', ""'wrap"", ""up'.If"", 'thought', 'would', 'work', ""'d"", 'have', 'tried', 'gather', 'everyone', 'together', 'mass', 'returning', 'DVDs', 'publisher', 'demanding', 'not', 'refund', 'return', 'drawing', 'board.After', 'debaccle', ""'d"", 'almost', 'hate', 'see', 'Masaki', 'family', 'subjected', 'furhter', 'indignity']",Tenchi Muyo!
