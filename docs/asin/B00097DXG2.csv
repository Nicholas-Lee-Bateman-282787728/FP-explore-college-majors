The quality of the restoration and the rarity of many of the films makes this an ideal introduction to Roscoe Arbuckle, a comic actor many people rank just below Chaplin, Keaton and Lloyd. If your only familiarity with Arbuckle is the Virginia Rappe scandal (of which he was found NOT GUILTY), I recommend you take a look at these films to discover what a marvelous talent the world lost when the media figuratively railroaded him out of Hollywood. Several examples of his work as a director under the pseudonym William Goodrich are also included. By the way, he was never known as Will B.

902483,A62G4QX6XQVLP,B00097DXG2,Anyechka,"[5, 5]","It's such a treat and joy to have so many Roscoe Arbuckle films gathered together in one place, and with such a respectful and top-notch treatment, after so many years of unavailability.  This set proves that he was indeed the true fourth genius of silent comedy, a title which I personally think he deserves far more than the overrated Harry Langdon.  Most of my favorites on this set are on the third and fourth discs, among them 'The Waiters' Ball' (1916), 'Love' (1919), 'Coney Island' (1917), co-starring a frequently smiling Buster Keaton, 'He Did and He Didn't' (1916), and the four 1920s shorts he wrote and directed with various second-tier silent comedians.  (The final short, 'Bridge Wives' [1932], stars his nephew Al St. John, who appears in almost all of the other shorts; it was so nice to finally hear his voice, after so long of only seeing him in silents!)  Viewing the shorts in order really gives a sense of how much he was developing as a performer and a comedian, going from the rather crude and simplistic earliest Keystones (which, to be honest, haven't really aged that well) to more complex, polished, and sophisticated shorts like 'He Did and He Didn't' and 'Love,' culminating in his long-unreleased feature 'Leap Year' (1921), a truly well-crafted and sophisticated character comedy.Though for many people, Keystone comedies are an acquired taste, one can't really be a fan of Roscoe unless one appreciates and respects these early film roots of his.  Though the earliest Keystones haven't aged so well, they were hugely successful and made him a huge star, so much so that the other comedians of the era, particularly Chaplin and Keaton, often copied from him and considered him a very important teacher.  And even within the confines of Mack Sennett's style, one can see Roscoe adapting his own character and slowly breaking out of that Keystone mold, becoming more independent.  There's a huge difference, for example, between films like 'Fatty Joins the Force' (1913) and 'A Flirt's Mistake' (1914), and mid-range films like 'Fatty's Plucky Pup' (1915) and 'Wished on Mabel' (1915), where there's more of a plot and greater character development.  One also must consider the audience for whom these early films were made.  At this time, the movies were still by and large the entertainment of the masses, many of them immigrants who couldn't speak English, not refined high-society folks.  These shorts may appear cookie-cutter, crude, and badly-aged today, but in their time they did the job they were supposed to for their target audience.Once Roscoe did get away from the Keystone mold and gained more control over his films, he just got better and better, more and more professional, funnier and funnier, with a more and more endearing character.  It's such a pity that the unfortunate scandal and his subsequent undeserved blacklisting happened when they did, since he'd been at the peak of his career, the top of his game, in some places voted the number-one comedian, above even Chaplin.  He was even the very first of the big-name comedians to make a feature film, though it was unreleased in America for decades.  There's no telling how his career would have continued to unfold had events gone otherwise.  One can only guess how well he might have transitioned into features, the later part of the silent era (since the late Teens and very early Twenties were kind of a transitional period for film), or even the early sound era.  Given the strength of the included shorts he wrote and directed, though, it seems as though he would have continued to soar as a star in his own right.  It's too bad that the producers of this set didn't include one of his own sound shorts from the early Thirties, just to complete the view of the development of his career.  It's too bad that this wonderful set is already out of print, but perhaps someday there might be another volume issued of more of his surviving films, esp. as more of them are turning up in recent years.",5,A true treasure trove,1208995200,"04 24, 2008",2008,4003,"['such', 'treat', 'joy', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'Roscoe', 'Arbuckle', 'films', 'gathered', 'together', 'one', 'place', 'such', 'respectful', 'top-notch', 'treatment', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'unavailability', 'set', 'was', 'indeed', 'true', 'fourth', 'genius', 'silent', 'comedy', 'title', 'personally', 'think', 'far', 'more', 'overrated', 'Harry', 'Langdon', 'Most', 'favorites', 'set', 'are', 'third', 'fourth', 'discs', 'Waiters', 'Ball', '1916', '1919', 'Island', '1917', 'co-starring', 'frequently', 'smiling', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'Did', 'Did', ""n't"", '1916', 'four', '1920s', 'shorts', 'wrote', 'directed', 'various', 'second-tier', 'silent', 'comedians', 'final', 'short', 'Wives', '[', '1932', ']', 'nephew', 'Al', 'St.', 'John', 'who', 'almost', 'other', 'shorts', 'was', 'so', 'nice', 'finally', 'hear', 'voice', 'so', 'long', 'only', 'seeing', 'silents', 'Viewing', 'shorts', 'order', 'really', 'sense', 'how', 'much', 'was', 'developing', 'performer', 'comedian', 'going', 'rather', 'crude', 'simplistic', 'earliest', 'Keystones', 'be', 'honest', 'have', ""n't"", 'really', 'aged', 'that', 'well', 'more', 'complex', 'polished', 'sophisticated', 'shorts', 'Did', 'Did', ""n't"", ""'Love"", 'culminating', 'long-unreleased', 'feature', ""'Leap"", 'Year', '1921', 'truly', 'well-crafted', 'sophisticated', 'character', 'comedy.Though', 'many', 'people', 'Keystone', 'comedies', 'are', 'acquired', 'taste', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'be', 'fan', 'Roscoe', 'one', 'appreciates', 'early', 'film', 'roots', 'earliest', 'Keystones', 'have', ""n't"", 'aged', 'so', 'well', 'were', 'hugely', 'successful', 'made', 'huge', 'star', 'so', 'much', 'other', 'comedians', 'era', 'particularly', 'Chaplin', 'Keaton', 'often', 'copied', 'considered', 'very', 'important', 'teacher', 'even', 'confines', 'Mack', 'Sennett', 'style', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'Roscoe', 'adapting', 'own', 'character', 'slowly', 'breaking', 'Keystone', 'mold', 'becoming', 'more', 'independent', 'huge', 'difference', 'example', 'films', ""'Fatty"", 'Force', '1913', 'A', 'Flirt', 'Mistake', '1914', 'mid-range', 'films', ""'Fatty"", 'Plucky', 'Pup', '1915', ""'Wished"", 'Mabel', '1915', 'where', 'more', 'plot', 'greater', 'character', 'development', 'One', 'also', 'must', 'consider', 'audience', 'whom', 'early', 'films', 'were', 'made', 'time', 'movies', 'were', 'still', 'large', 'entertainment', 'masses', 'many', 'immigrants', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'speak', 'English', 'not', 'refined', 'high-society', 'folks', 'shorts', 'may', 'appear', 'cookie-cutter', 'crude', 'badly-aged', 'today', 'time', 'did', 'job', 'were', 'supposed', 'target', 'audience.Once', 'Roscoe', 'did', 'get', 'away', 'Keystone', 'mold', 'gained', 'more', 'control', 'films', 'just', 'got', 'better', 'better', 'more', 'more', 'professional', 'funnier', 'funnier', 'more', 'more', 'endearing', 'character', 'such', 'pity', 'unfortunate', 'scandal', 'subsequent', 'undeserved', 'blacklisting', 'happened', 'when', 'did', ""'d"", 'been', 'peak', 'career', 'top', 'game', 'places', 'voted', 'number-one', 'comedian', 'even', 'Chaplin', 'was', 'even', 'very', 'first', 'big-name', 'comedians', 'make', 'feature', 'film', 'was', 'unreleased', 'America', 'decades', 'telling', 'how', 'career', 'would', 'have', 'continued', 'unfold', 'had', 'events', 'gone', 'otherwise', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'guess', 'how', 'well', 'might', 'have', 'transitioned', 'features', 'later', 'part', 'silent', 'era', 'late', 'Teens', 'very', 'early', 'Twenties', 'were', 'kind', 'transitional', 'period', 'film', 'even', 'early', 'sound', 'era', 'Given', 'strength', 'included', 'shorts', 'wrote', 'directed', 'would', 'have', 'continued', 'soar', 'star', 'own', 'right', 'too', 'bad', 'producers', 'set', 'did', ""n't"", 'include', 'one', 'own', 'sound', 'shorts', 'early', 'Thirties', 'just', 'complete', 'view', 'development', 'career', 'too', 'bad', 'wonderful', 'set', 'already', 'print', 'perhaps', 'someday', 'might', 'be', 'volume', 'issued', 'more', 'surviving', 'films', 'esp', 'more', 'are', 'turning', 'up', 'recent', 'years']","The Forgotten Films of Roscoe ""Fatty"" Arbuckle"
902484,AH9K6PPVZKVY3,B00097DXG2,Barbara (Burkowsky) Underwood,"[26, 27]","This is a superb 4-disc set that has been long overdue, but well worth the wait.  Obviously a great deal of careful thought and effort has gone into this set, both in film restoration and overall presentation so that silent comedy experts and novices alike are sure to get a lot out of it.  For a start, a 36-page booklet with excellent photos (some in color) contains essays and various information on Arbuckle, his work and films, as well as the manslaughter charge in 1921 - of which he was acquitted - that drastically changed the course of his career.  Due to those unfortunate events many Arbuckle films have been sorely neglected, and most people might only be familiar with him through his 1917-1919 films with his famous prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Buster Keaton.  The films presented here range from his start in the classic Keystone comedies in 1913 to a sound comedy (the only sound film in this set) from 1932 directed by Arbuckle, but most of them are Keystone comedies from 1915.  They are the classic slapstick comedies most of us are familiar with, yet this selection is enhanced by other great comedy talents like the charming and delightful Mabel Normand who interacted with Arbuckle so well that this team was immensely popular with audiences; the often overlooked talents of lanky Al St John, who often plays Arbuckle's love rival and is an amusing contrast to Arbuckle's rotundness; and let's not forget Luke, the amazing super dog who adds spice to every scene in which he appears.  Other highlights for me personally are, of course, Arbuckle's trademark flips and flicks with flapjacks and huge kitchen knives which he does expertly without even looking, and his very convincing transformation in women's apparel:  really, if you didn't know it was Roscoe, you'd swear it was a funny, chubby girl!Most of my favourites are on the fourth disc which features films of the 1920s, starting with a great 1-hour feature film ""Leap Year"", which was never released in the US.  There is an entertaining segment featuring  brief (ie a few seconds) appearances of other big stars: Keaton, Valentino, Fairbanks, Harold Lloyd and Jackie Coogan, and then five more comedies, each one quite different and all directed by Roscoe Arbuckle (some written by him as well) under the name of William Goodrich, and each one features other comedians.  Particularly impressive is ""My Stars"" with Johnny Arthur, who does a great job of impersonating and making fun of stars like Harold Lloyd and Douglas Fairbanks - the latter dressed as Robin Hood, making flying leaps, bounds and gestures in an attempt to put Fairbanks to shame.  I also got a kick out of the clever short sound comedy, ""Bridge Wives"", but with such variety on this disc and overall in the whole set, I'm sure there'll be something to satisfy everyone.  Furthermore, careful attention to musical accompaniment means variety in performances and instruments (though most are piano scores) and there are also a few commentary tracks which add more insight into Arbuckle, his films and his many talented co-stars.  Definitely a must for all silent comedy and slapstick fans!",5,The Forgotten 'Fourth Genius' of Silent Comedy,1118361600,"06 10, 2005",2005,3132,"['superb', '4-disc', 'set', 'been', 'long', 'overdue', 'well', 'wait', 'Obviously', 'great', 'deal', 'careful', 'thought', 'effort', 'gone', 'set', 'film', 'restoration', 'overall', 'presentation', 'silent', 'comedy', 'experts', 'novices', 'alike', 'are', 'sure', 'get', 'lot', 'start', '36-page', 'booklet', 'excellent', 'photos', 'color', 'essays', 'various', 'information', 'Arbuckle', 'work', 'films', 'as', 'well', 'manslaughter', 'charge', '1921', 'was', 'acquitted', 'drastically', 'changed', 'course', 'career', 'Due', 'unfortunate', 'events', 'many', 'Arbuckle', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'sorely', 'neglected', 'most', 'people', 'might', 'only', 'be', 'familiar', '1917-1919', 'films', 'famous', 'prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'films', 'presented', 'here', 'range', 'start', 'classic', 'Keystone', 'comedies', '1913', 'sound', 'comedy', 'only', 'sound', 'film', 'set', '1932', 'directed', 'Arbuckle', 'most', 'are', 'Keystone', 'comedies', '1915', 'are', 'classic', 'slapstick', 'comedies', 'most', 'are', 'familiar', 'yet', 'selection', 'enhanced', 'other', 'great', 'comedy', 'talents', 'charming', 'delightful', 'Mabel', 'Normand', 'who', 'interacted', 'Arbuckle', 'so', 'well', 'team', 'was', 'immensely', 'popular', 'audiences', 'often', 'overlooked', 'talents', 'lanky', 'Al', 'St', 'John', 'who', 'often', 'Arbuckle', 'love', 'rival', 'amusing', 'contrast', 'Arbuckle', 'rotundness', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'Luke', 'amazing', 'super', 'dog', 'who', 'spice', 'scene', 'Other', 'highlights', 'personally', 'are', 'course', 'Arbuckle', 'trademark', 'flips', 'flicks', 'flapjacks', 'huge', 'kitchen', 'knives', 'expertly', 'even', 'looking', 'very', 'convincing', 'transformation', 'women', 'apparel', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'Roscoe', ""'d"", 'swear', 'was', 'funny', 'chubby', 'girl', 'Most', 'favourites', 'are', 'fourth', 'disc', 'films', '1920s', 'starting', 'great', '1-hour', 'feature', 'film', 'Leap', 'Year', 'was', 'never', 'released', 'US', 'entertaining', 'segment', 'featuring', 'brief', 'ie', 'few', 'seconds', 'appearances', 'other', 'big', 'stars', 'Keaton', 'Valentino', 'Fairbanks', 'Harold', 'Lloyd', 'Jackie', 'Coogan', 'then', 'five', 'more', 'comedies', 'one', 'quite', 'different', 'directed', 'Roscoe', 'Arbuckle', 'written', 'as', 'well', 'name', 'William', 'Goodrich', 'one', 'other', 'comedians', 'Particularly', 'impressive', 'Stars', 'Johnny', 'Arthur', 'who', 'great', 'job', 'impersonating', 'making', 'fun', 'stars', 'Harold', 'Lloyd', 'Douglas', 'Fairbanks', 'latter', 'dressed', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'making', 'flying', 'leaps', 'bounds', 'gestures', 'attempt', 'put', 'Fairbanks', 'shame', 'also', 'got', 'kick', 'clever', 'short', 'sound', 'comedy', 'Bridge', 'Wives', 'such', 'variety', 'disc', 'overall', 'whole', 'set', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'be', 'something', 'satisfy', 'everyone', 'Furthermore', 'careful', 'attention', 'musical', 'accompaniment', 'variety', 'performances', 'instruments', 'most', 'are', 'piano', 'scores', 'are', 'also', 'few', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'add', 'more', 'insight', 'Arbuckle', 'films', 'many', 'talented', 'co-stars', 'Definitely', 'must', 'silent', 'comedy', 'slapstick', 'fans']","The Forgotten Films of Roscoe ""Fatty"" Arbuckle"
902485,A3M5UGU0NGD38D,B00097DXG2,Casey62,"[1, 1]","It's ironic that at one time Roscoe ""Fatty"" Arbuckle's popularity as a silent screen comedian rivaled that of Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, and Harold Lloyd, until the scandalous rape/murder trial of 1921 that sealed his fate. Although judged innocent of the charge, Arbuckle was blacklisted and his films were banned across the nation. He made a brief comeback in the early '30's in shorts made by the Vitaphone Co. until his untimely death in 1933.Arbuckle's comedies relied heavily on slapstick, which was the main ingredient at Mack Sennett's Keystone studio where Arbuckle got his start in 1913. His films also contain clever gags and are often more technically innovative than those of his contemporaries. Some even reach a sublime level, such as the charming HE DID AND HE DIDN'T (Triangle, 1916). Being as rotund as he was, Arbuckle was extremely agile, and could take pratfalls with the grace of a dancer. Not only did he influence Chaplin and Keaton at the beginning of their careers, but others like Stan Laurel, Oliver Hardy and The Three Stooges borrowed and expanded many of Arbuckle's ideas.Mackinac Media's 4 DVD collection of 32 shorts preserves the legacy of Fatty Arbuckle for the 21st century in fully restored prints, some containing previously lost footage. Several of Arbuckle's co-stars included here besides Chaplin and Keaton are Mabel Normand, Harold Lloyd, Al St. John, Ford Sterling and Edgar Kennedy. The quality, considering the age of the films, is excellent. New scores were composed by Philip Carli, David Drazin, Ben Model, The Mont Alto Orchestra, The Paragon Ragtime Orchestra, Rodney Sauer and Donald Sosin. Bonus features include alternate commentary tracks, a handsomely illustrated 36 page booklet that includes essays and a chronological list of the movies in this volume. There's also a new music video, ""The Arbuckle Shuffle"", made up of film clips.I cannot praise this collection highly enough. Every lover of silent comedy should grab this up and experience the genius of ""Fatty"" Arbuckle from a fresh perspective. It's a long overdue tribute to a totally original performer, one of the first great clowns of the cinema.Highly recommended.",5,FORGOTTEN FUNNYMAN IS DONE JUSTICE,1376438400,"08 14, 2013",2013,2187,"['ironic', 'one', 'time', 'Roscoe', 'Fatty', 'Arbuckle', 'popularity', 'silent', 'screen', 'comedian', 'rivaled', 'Charlie', 'Chaplin', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'Harold', 'Lloyd', 'scandalous', 'rape/murder', 'trial', '1921', 'sealed', 'fate', 'judged', 'innocent', 'charge', 'Arbuckle', 'was', 'blacklisted', 'films', 'were', 'banned', 'nation', 'made', 'brief', 'comeback', 'early', ""'30"", 'shorts', 'made', 'Vitaphone', 'Co.', 'untimely', 'death', '1933.Arbuckle', 'comedies', 'relied', 'heavily', 'slapstick', 'was', 'main', 'ingredient', 'Mack', 'Sennett', 'Keystone', 'studio', 'where', 'Arbuckle', 'got', 'start', '1913', 'films', 'also', 'contain', 'clever', 'gags', 'are', 'often', 'more', 'technically', 'innovative', 'contemporaries', 'even', 'reach', 'sublime', 'level', 'such', 'charming', 'HE', 'DID', 'HE', 'DID', ""N'T"", 'Triangle', '1916', 'Being', 'as', 'rotund', 'was', 'Arbuckle', 'was', 'extremely', 'agile', 'could', 'take', 'pratfalls', 'grace', 'dancer', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'influence', 'Chaplin', 'Keaton', 'beginning', 'careers', 'others', 'Stan', 'Laurel', 'Oliver', 'Hardy', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'borrowed', 'expanded', 'many', 'Arbuckle', 'ideas.Mackinac', 'Media', '4', 'DVD', 'collection', '32', 'shorts', 'legacy', 'Fatty', 'Arbuckle', '21st', 'century', 'fully', 'restored', 'prints', 'containing', 'previously', 'lost', 'footage', 'Several', 'Arbuckle', 'co-stars', 'included', 'here', 'Chaplin', 'Keaton', 'are', 'Mabel', 'Normand', 'Harold', 'Lloyd', 'Al', 'St.', 'John', 'Ford', 'Sterling', 'Edgar', 'Kennedy', 'quality', 'considering', 'age', 'films', 'excellent', 'New', 'scores', 'were', 'composed', 'Philip', 'Carli', 'David', 'Drazin', 'Ben', 'Model', 'Mont', 'Alto', 'Orchestra', 'Paragon', 'Ragtime', 'Orchestra', 'Rodney', 'Sauer', 'Donald', 'Sosin', 'Bonus', 'include', 'alternate', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'handsomely', 'illustrated', '36', 'page', 'booklet', 'essays', 'chronological', 'list', 'movies', 'volume', 'also', 'new', 'music', 'video', 'Arbuckle', 'Shuffle', 'made', 'film', 'clips.I', 'can', 'not', 'praise', 'collection', 'highly', 'enough', 'Every', 'lover', 'silent', 'comedy', 'should', 'grab', 'up', 'experience', 'genius', 'Fatty', 'Arbuckle', 'fresh', 'perspective', 'long', 'overdue', 'tribute', 'totally', 'original', 'performer', 'one', 'first', 'great', 'clowns', 'cinema.Highly', 'recommended']","The Forgotten Films of Roscoe ""Fatty"" Arbuckle"

One of its most rewarding aspects is the tracing of Arbuckle's development as a comic genius and having the opportunity to see the antics of some of the lesser known people he surrounded himself with. The collaborations with Mabel Normand and Al St John have been around for years but you almost never get to see Minta Durfee (Arbuckle's first wife and lifelong friend) or Edgar Kennedy (when he had hair) before his Hal Roach days. It's great to have the early Keystone comedies in decent prints (paper prints from the Library Of Congress) although the formula does wear thin after awhile.Of special interest are discs 3 and 4 devoted to Arbuckle after Keystone and to his directing efforts after the 1921 scandal which wrongly resulted in his being banned from the screen as a performer. This material is very rare and features comics Lloyd Hamilton and Lupino Lane as well as a special treat from Douglas Fairbanks called CHARACTER STUDIES which features Carter DeHaven and a surprise postscandal appearance by Arbuckle. There is also an over the top sound film with Al St John (before he became a B Western sidekick) called BRIDGE WIVES which must be seen to be believed.This brings me to the three minor issues I have with this otherwise sterling set. It would have nice to have one of the late Arbuckle sound shorts included so that we could hear Roscoe talk as well as see one of his last onscreen appearances. Why are there two versions of HE DID AND HE DIDN'T (only the tinting differs) when there could have been one more comedy added? It would also have been nice to have more commentary to give background on these films as they unfold. Out of 30 films only 7 have this feature.But these are minor complaints with one of the best packaged silent sets in recent memory. The film presentations are fine, the musical accompaniment ideal, the commentary good, and the choice of material is great  (Fatty's only surviving feature film LEAP YEAR is especially valuable to have and see). This release also comes with a comprehensive 35 page booklet on Arbuckle and the restoration work that needed to be done.

902487,A2ZA2FUK6UVRNX,B00097DXG2,Donald Rogers,"[17, 24]","For diehard fans of silent comedy, this is an important and overdue collection of Arbuckle's shorts, mostly from the teens, as well as some of his post-scandal directorial efforts. It contains much rare material, and it is very nicely restored and assembled.And yet... compared to the best silent comedies, say the Keaton shorts or the Chaplin Mutuals, this is mostly pretty thin stuff. It's not Arbuckle's fault, exactly -- he was an incredibly dextrous physical comedian. But his screen persona -- a giant man-child ball of id -- is far less attractive than Keaton's or Chaplin's.

These films, like the earliest Chaplins, work mainly on the Sennett principle: effectively delivering the gag you expect.This is certainly the best Arbuckle collection available, and the four DVDs are reasonably priced.

I absolutely love these DVDs, the quality is fantastic, the music is great, no annoying sound effects here, and the booklet that comes with the set is gold.

He has been repeatedly trashed and lied about through the decades, starting with contemporary newspapers, women's groups, rubbish on tabloid-TV  shows, Anger's obscene books, and the recent ""I, Fatty"" whose author fictionalized the man's life and passed it off as truth. A drunken woman of very ill repute died after possibly having a back-alley abortion at one of Arbuckle's parties. Thanks to a lying friend of the victim and a crooked DA (Hollywood couldn't even write this), as well as a public eager for gossip on newly created movie stars and phony pictures in the papers, Arbuckle is still known by the lesser educated at the ""fat guy who killed a woman with a bottle."" Thank goodness Paul Gierucki and his Laughsmith company have come along with these films and a documentary. The man died over 70 years ago, still slandered.These films looks so good you wouldn't think they were made as long ago as 1913. Some you can watch with commentary, and I prefer the latter.

902499,A22BL7L1Y40VPE,B00097DXG2,Robert Morris,"[20, 20]","You don't have to believe that Roscoe ""Fatty"" Arbuckle is the equal in genius to Chaplin, Lloyd and Keaton to appreciate this collection. The producers of this set believe he is, and they have put a great deal of love and dedication into this collection. Two aspects of Arbuckle's talents are showcased: as a silent comic actor with Keystone and later independently, and as a writer or director (later using the pseudonym ""William Goodrich"" after his notorious scandal rendered him unemployable after 1922).To be convinced of Roscoe's talents as a comic actor, one needs first to check out  ""Fatty's Plucky Pup"", the best Keystone entry in this collection.  Often, Arbuckle's screen character is lazy, clumsy and empty-headed, prone to intentional or unintentional violence, until eventually driven by the love of a girl or some other incentive into redemptive action. The first reel of this movie is one of the best sequences in early silent comedy, as Fatty first burns his bed by falling asleep smoking, then transforms wash day into a disaster, as he first drops the laundry into the mud, then hangs it up, then tries to wash the clothes again with the hose, only resulting in getting himself, and his mother, soaked. The visual humor builds and cascades naturally, with all the actors well synchronized as in a dance or a vaudeville tumbling act. The Keystone-style chase at the end, showcasing the remarkable Luke the dog, is surprisingly refined, even suspenseful. This film matches easily, and perhaps exceeds, the creative output of Chaplin  during the same period. Other fascinating films include ""He Did and He Didn't"" with Mabel Normand, which is a surprisingly dark, serious (albeit with a surprise ending) study of jealousy and revenge; ""Coney Island"" with Buster Keaton, an early glimpse into their partnership; and a generous sampling of other Keystone partnerings with Mabel Normand.  This team produced movies that are remarkably sweet and romantic without being sugary.As a sheer creative force, however, I was not convinced that Arbuckle belongs with Chaplin, Lloyd or Keaton. The later films in volume 4, which showcase his technical skills as writer and director, are at best a mixed bag. The movies starring Al St. John and Lupino Lane, in particular, are tired, unfunny imitations of the style of Keaton, Lloyd and the Keystone studio.Another reason for owning this set is to gain a new appreciation of the output of the Keystone studio itself. The restorations in this set are superb, with good resolution and an apparent reduction in the speed of the film, so one gets a chance to observe the comic detail. The result is a realization that Keystone films were not all punches, kicks, cop chases and exaggerated pantomime.As a final side note, someone seriously should do a box set on Mabel Normand. Her grace, breeziness and natural style of acting make her entirely convincing to the modern viewer -- she is closer to modern comic actresses like Meg Ryan than to the ""silent clowns"" she appeared with. Her humor often arises from a contrast between her innocent, petite, feminine exterior and a flirtatious, even lascivious behavior, and she can take or give a punch, or a comic fall, as good as the guys.

Until this set came true, the only films of Arbuckle that were available to the public in reasonably appealing presentations were his collaborations with Buster Keaton at Triangle in 1917-19; and though some of these films are rightly evaluated as possibly his best work, the progression he underwent while still at Keystone turns out to have been quite remarkable in its own right. While the set has received enthusiastic response for the most part, a few reviewers have been dismissive of its content, arguing that Arbuckle was solely a crowd-pleaser of his own time and that his work has not aged with the grace of Chaplin, Keaton or Lloyd. What this analysis fails to recognize, is that Arbuckle's career was shut down almost at the precise moment when silent comedy reached its golden period of the early 1920's and throughout the decade. However, I'm convinced that anyone who cares to grant these films more than casual attention will discover that Arbuckle did things in 1915, both as a comedian and film-maker, which made him stand out from most of his contemporaries, let alone at Keystone's ""madcap factory."" Take a short film like MABEL AND FATTY'S WASH DAY, released early in 1915 and included in this set, and then compare it to films of almost any other comedian of the same period. Yes, the plot is extremely simplistic (what do you expect; Roscoe had to make two or three such films each month), but there is a warmth, a human touch which still charms irresistibly, nearly a hundred years later. Even at this early point, Arbuckle was developing a relatively consistent personality for his character, which made him into more of a fully-rounded human being on screen, and less of a ""type"" that would uncritically adjust his behavior to what the particular scenario of a film demanded.As for his directorial skills, Arbuckle was clearly among the most inventive comedy directors of the 'teens. Somewhat disappointingly, his possibly most outstanding work FATTY AND MABEL ADRIFT is not to be found in this set (it is available as part of the huge set SLAPSTICK ENCYCLOPEDIA), but HE DID AND HE DIDN'T also ranks among the more sophisticated comedies of the period, a cleverly directed parody on melodrama which, I suspect, could likely be interpreted as a genuine, serious intrigue to unfamiliar viewers. My personal favorite may be the long-lost LOVE, whose two reels were recently obtained, incredibly, from two distinct sources. Also among the highlights are the shorts Arbuckle directed under the ""Will B. Good""-pseudonym in the 1920's; as his directorial abilities are being further emphasized in films such as THE MOVIES, FOOL'S LUCK and MY STARS, a slight depression is likely to appear as one imagines how far Arbuckle could have reached, had it not been for the scandal. Less inspired is the feature LEAP YEAR, which was never released in the U.S. due to the scandal but survives thanks to its European distribution. The film, it should be stressed, was not directed by Arbuckle, and resembles more of a ""drawing-room"" domestic comedy, providing Roscoe with little opportunity to showcase his amazing physical agility. Yet, the film improves somewhat with repeated viewings, and as a completist I'm glad it is included here.THE FORGOTTEN FILMS OF ROSCOE ""FATTY"" ARBUCKLE is a set which no devoted silent film fan should let pass by, and I am crossing fingers that there will be a follow-up compilation, as has been rumored. I do miss the six sound shorts Arbuckle starred in towards the end of his life, but apparently these were unavailable for release at this point. Finally, be sure to get, if at all possible, a copy that contains the booklet included in the set, which provides essays written by film historians and archivists, covering both Arbuckle's career as well as the making of this project.

902501,AT07UZQQR7ZEH,B00097DXG2,"Stephen H. Wood ""Film scholar and vintage mov...","[10, 11]","""The Forgotten Films of Roscoe `Fatty' ARBUCKLE"" is a sad and wonderful four volume DVD boxed set.  It is a heartfelt labor of love valentine to a great silent era movie clown who bounced back even stronger after a 1922 San Francisco sex scandal that was filled with scandalous lies and downright nastiness.  Faced with a public that refused to believe the court ruling that he was innocent of all charges Arbuckle, helped by best friend Buster Keaton, became a renowned and downright brilliant writer and director in the late twenties.  He also helped direct several Keaton silent feature masterpieces without credit.What a lovely DVD boxed set this is!  Volumes one and two, about two-and-a-half-hours each, give us the Keystone gems of 1914-1915.  Roscoe Arbuckle stars in several two-reelers for Mack Sennett with newcomer Charlie Chaplin, including THE KNOCKOUT and THE ROUNDERS.  These two volumes give generous coverage to ""Fatty and Mabel"" (Normand), often as neighbors, often married to one another.  Titles include ...WASH DAY, ...AT THE SAN DIEGO EXPOSITION, FATTY'S NEW ROLE, FATTY'S FAITHFUL FIDO, ...MARRIED LIFE, and WISHED ON MABEL.  These shorts are funny, poignant, and very nostalgic.  I've only seen one Mabel Normand feature film, from 1923; I do wish she had lived to make more.  Rumor has it that Mabel and Roscoe (no one close to him called him ""Fatty"") often directed their own films.  And that Chaplin and Arbuckle (and Keaton later) stole gags from one another.  Significantly, Arbuckle usually got there first.ARBUCKLE disk three has FATTY'S TINTYPE TANGLE (1915); HE DID AND HE DIDN'T (1916) with full tinting, and the nostalgic CONEY ISLAND (1917).  Co-stars include Keaton, Al St. John, Normand, Louise Fazenda, and Edgar Kennedy.  But the jewel of disk three is the premiere revival of a ""lost"" film called  LOVE (1919), with Monty Banks and St. John joining Roscoe.  My only regret is the exclusion of my favorite ""Fatty and Mabel"" two-reeler, FATTY AND MABEL ADRIFT (1916).  Maybe it can star in an Arbuckle volume two collection.The real revelations take place in disk four with LEAP YEAR (1921), never released in America.  It is presented here in a gorgeous 35mm tinted archive print found in Europe and shows us a new direction Arbuckle might have taken  if the blasted scandal had not destroyed him forever as an actor.  It is a Noel Coward-like drawing room romantic comedy.  Let's search some more European film archives for other ""lost"" Arbuckle features from around 1921.But the real astonishment for me with this whole incomparable boxed set is the second half of volume four, Arbuckle spending the 1920's  busy as a stunningly creative writer and director named ""William Goodrich."" Rumor has it that, uncredited, Arbuckle helped best friend Buster Keaton direct several silent Keaton features.  As Goodrich, he just about floors one with uproarious laughter in a 1925 western cliffhanger serial spoof called CURSES (Al St. John), the 1925-1926 Hollywood satires THE MOVIES (Lloyd Hamilton) and MY STARS (Johnny Arthur), and a 1926 thrill comedy called FOOL'S LUCK (Lupino Lane).Funniest and most inventive of all is a 1932 sound one-reel domestic farce with Al St. John called BRIDGE WIVES.  People, this comic masterpiece was made only one year before Arbuckle died, giving  the complete lie to the Hollywood myth that he died alone and forgotten.  He really died of a heart attack at a writer/director peak.  And he was clearly magnificently talented in both capacities as ""William Goodrich"".  We simply have to find some more ""lost"" Goodrich/Educational Pictures silent shorts if the found and restored ones here are this peerlessly funny!Silent film comedy lovers, do yourselves a favor.  Buy or rent the fabulously funny ""The Forgotten Films of Roscoe `Fatty' ARBUCKLE"" on four disk DVD today.  Spend four very special nights with Roscoe and realize that he truly was and is one of the silver screen's four great silent clowns, now and forever.The DVD set, incidentally, comes with a lovely 36

902502,A2D63RN5LF14R2,B00097DXG2,"THE BLUEMAHLER ""THE BLUEMAHLER""","[3, 4]","Hidden deep in the recesses of early cinema lies a rarely seen, obscure gem that might be described as something resembling a Max Beckman Moving Picture.Roscoe Arbuckle's 1916 He Did and He Didn't is a humorous, expressionistic nightmare which not only calls to mind the texture and atmosphere of Max Beckman expressionist paintings, but also, in heroine Mabel Normand, evokes Edvard Munch as well.Arbuckle had been shifting away from the frantic style of the Mack Sennett factory towards more character driven comedy, and had taken over writing and directing his own films and making features long before Chaplin, Keaton and Lloyd followed suit.He Did and He Didn't uniquely stands out even among the later Arbuckle films, which is saying quite a bit as Arbuckle was innovative both as a performer and director.  His perfectionism was well known and he might very well have earned the crown for king of multiple takes, although the gracefulness he displayed on both sides of the camera never even remotely hints at such perfectionist standards.Arbuckle has been widely credited for influencing such artists as Charlie Chaplin,  Buster Keaton, Oliver Hardy and Curly Howard.  His distinct on-screen persona was normally that of a country bumpkin and ladies man.Naturally, every great screen personality needs an equally distinct nemesis.  Chaplin had Eric Campbell, Langdon had Vernon Dent, Arbuckle had his Al St. John.  The two appeared together in numerous films and, later, Arbuckle directed St. John in Curses (1925) and Bridge Wives (1932).  Lanky, bad teeth, bad hair and bad clothes, St. John was Arbuckle's perfect country bumpkin foil in The Waiter's Ball (1916), Coney Island (1917) and the recently restored Love (1919), in which Arbuckle donned drag, as he frequently did (Good Night Nurse, an imaginative nightmare fantasy with Keaton, St. John and Arbuckle as a nurse, remains his most memorable drag performance ).  Love seems like a charmed, distant cousin to an imagined early Tex Avery cartoon starring John Water's late star, Divine.Mabel Normand was Arbuckle's frequent leading lady and possessed an inimitable personality of the pixie girl from the wrong side of the tracks.  She was never better than when directed by Arbuckle.  She and St. John are on hand for He Did and He Didn't, but compared to their other Arbuckle projects, this film has a different quality altogether.Arbuckle, dressed in evening tux, is an upper class doctor and Mabel his much put upon wife.  The two are preparing for evening dinner. Arbuckle looks the image of the suave, sinister, cigarette in hand, Beckmanesque figure, ready for a party.  Mabel, his pale, thin, dark haired, bug-eyed wife appears to have just stepped out of an angst-ridden Munch canvas.  There's a bit of business about Arbuckle attempting to fasten his bow tie.  Mabel offers sympathy, but Arbuckle only makes faces in his mockery of her.  She jumps up, asks him to fasten her dress, and sneaks in a kiss as her arms fling around his neck.  Disgusted, Arbuckle wipes off the kiss and punches her in the ribs... dress fastened!  We are told this is their usual evening and the interplay between two recalls and pre-dates similar domestic strife shows like The Honeymooners.Mabel leaves to fetch the butler so he can assist Arbuckle.  Arbuckle smashes his fingers in a drawer.  Rube Miller's saturnine butler arrives to find his master on his knees, rubbing his sore fingers together.  Miller assumes Arbuckle is praying and drops to his knees to pray with him.  Arbuckle angrily grabs his employee and gives him a swift kick for his error, fairly sacrilegious for 1916.These are ugly, grotesque characters and Arbuckle daringly does not ask, nor does he receive, much in way of audience sympathy.Mabel's childhood schoolmate, William Jefferson, has come for a reunion and soon jealousy soon rears it's ugly head.  Arbuckle welcomes his wife's childhood sweetheart to dinner, but then rips up Mabel's childhood picture.  A  lobster dinner is served and Mabel exclaims, ""we won't sleep a wink""; prophetic words indeed.Arbuckle is called off to a fake emergency so burglar Al St. John can make his way into the home.  This leaves Mabel and Jefferson alone with temptation.  Of course, fate will have the upper hand and soon St. John is discovered, leading to predictable frantic mayhem with Arbuckle arriving just in time to find Jefferson putting his wife to bed.  In a rage, Arbuckle throws Jefferson out of the house and strangles his wife, but not before she fires off a shot from a revolver, bringing the giant crashing down the stairwell. Arbuckle knows how to utilize sets and does so here splendidly.  The scenes in which Arbuckle strangles his wife and then goes tumbling after being shot by her are nightmarish and disturbingly funny, much more so than the standard Keystone fair.  Sexual foreplay, murder, deceit, attempted murder, and dreams are all afoot, making this a standout film for the period.  It all turns out to be a bad, shared dream of Arbuckle and Jefferson which they realize as dreamy images of lobsters are superimposed over them. They go to check up on Mabel, who sleeps innocently, having remained true to her Roscoe.  Arbuckle smiles knowingly at the camera and bids a suave, devilish adieu as he slowly shuts the door to his wife's bedchamber, to imagined private delights.He Did and He Didn't, in it's characters, atmosphere and tinting feels like a fevered lullaby from the heart of all that is expressionism.Arbuckle and Normand were enormously popular during the period and, even though their characters here are not necessarily sympathetic, it's easy to relate to 1916 tastes since they possess an undeniable, infectious charm.This film is available on the indispensable The Forgotten Films of Roscoe Arbuckle collection from Mackinac Media.
