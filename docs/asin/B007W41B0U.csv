Yet, the whole storyline has that same half-baked, fragmented feel that we get from so many films these days. Suspenseful at times, with some genuinely harrowing scenes, as well as some clever and surprising tie-ups. In the end, though, the whole feel of ""Intruders"" is draggy and repetitive.

What makes the movie less than it could have been is that either the writer, or script writer, or director, or editor just chopped up the storyline with mixed period timelines - first showing a young boy in an earlier time period and then later a young girl and then constantly jumping back and forth.

1539207,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B007W41B0U,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[3, 4]","Imagination is probably the most important tool to a child. Children grow the most fascinating things out of their imagination primarily because children are encouraged to use their imaginations in order to understand or to cope with the uglier parts of adulthood. By the time we become adults, we put a stop to many of the flights of imagination of youth because we know too much about the world. The less fantastical things seem, the more we as adults can mold them and control them. Those ideas are central to the theme of Juan Carlos Fresnadillo's psychological/paranormal thriller INTRUDERS, and with the gravitas of a world-class heavyweight actor like Clive Owen and some fascinating performances by younger actors such as Ella Purnell and Izan Corchero, along with some very clever effects work, these ideas are allowed to take shape for viewers to be engrossed and terrified by.The film has a dual narrative structure; at the beginning, we are introduced to the world of Luisa (Pilar Lopez de Ayala) and her son Juan (Corchero) as they live their middle-class existence in Madrid, but soon after a powerful and creepy opening, we switch to the slightly more affluent world of John Farrow (Owen), his beautiful wife Susanna (Carice Van Houten) and his loving daughter Mia (Purnell) and their lives in London. Both Juan and Mia are very similar in their gift of imagination, and both of them write of a frightening figure they call Hollowface, which is essentially a hooded man with a shapeless face. And as the writing continues, they seem to call forth an otherworldly force that comes to resemble their imaginary character, which seems initially to be the result of the child's overworked imaginations, but becomes all too real when John not only sees, but physically confronts Hollowface as it comes for his daughter. Back in Madrid, Luisa begins to believe that there is something unseen that is working its way into Juan, and turns to her church and one priest in particular (Daniel Bruhn) is very determined to help them. In London, the problems only worsen for Mia and for John as well, and they turn to psychology to drive the imaginings of Hollowface away. Both of these tales lead to a shocking twist as they start to come together, and to a conclusion that will save the souls and the sanity of both children.Fresnadillo joins the ranks of another Spanish director who has based his works of terror in an imaginary world, and that director is the much higher-profile Guillermo Del Toro, but this film bears a striking similarity to the early films of Del Toro's catalog, such as CRONOS or THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE or more recent films, particularly PAN'S LABIRYNTH. INTRUDERS has as much to do with the spiritual world and the imaginary world as it does with the real world, which is something quite common about many Spanish fantasy/horror filmmakers. Religion carries very heavily on these directors' themes, and this is a film that is of three different worlds: Imagination, Religion and Science, and these are certainly not things that we get very often in most Western cinema. The film, from a visual sense, is very striking and creates a consistent mood of of unease and disorientation for the viewer. From the scenes when John's at his construction job high above the streets of London, to scenes traveling through Luisa and Juan's home, there is a general sense that something is off-balance, and the split-narrative device also assists that. There are very few ""genuine scares"" to this film that one might expect for a more Americanized horror thriller, but this isn't a horror film; it's a terror film, and there is a distinct difference. This film has much more in common with the psychic damage of THE SIXTH SENSE than the more visceral horror of THE EXORCIST. It's more of a pervasive feeling of dread rather than a film that will scare you out of your seat; that's what I mean by calling this a ""terror"" film.Cast-wise, I've been wanting to wash the bad taste out of my mouth that Clive Owen (admittingly doing the best he could with what he had to work with) with the awful KILLER ELITE and the occasionally absurd HEMINGWAY AND GELLHORN and return him to the supremely good work he did in David Schwimmer's TRUST, and INTRUDERS is that film. I thought he was terrific in this as the frustrated and doting father who is watching his child getting lost further and further into her own psyche. Ella Purnell (who first made an impression on me in NEVER LET ME GO) is a talented-beyond-her-years young actress with tremendous instincts, and it's almost impossible to take your eyes off her when she's on screen. She radiates innocence and youthful charisma, but has a dark depth that she doesn't shy away from. Carice Van Houten, so excellent in films like BLACK BOOK and (coincidentally) BLACK DEATH, is sadly kind of wasted here; she's essentially the foil for the father-daughter dynamic but thankfully not to the point of parody. Pilar Lopez de Ayala is quite good as the harried and frightened mother to Izan Corchero's Juan. Corchero is also quite good, with a great expressiveness in his face and eyes that lend a much greater depth to this role. Daniel Bruhl (most famous for INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS, and can apparently speak every language) is not given a great deal to do here, but when he's on, he beings a kind of wide-eyed naivete and a kindness and charm to Luisa and Juan's priest.The script by Jaime Marques and Nicolas Casariego is smart enough to know when to talk and when to stop and let the dread take over. This is the first film I've seen from Fresnadillo, who also directed INTACTO and 28 WEEKS LATER, but those films are quickly going into my rental list. The way that Fresnadillo builds suspense and tension is something that not many have the werewithal to do with directing films of this type anymore. He holds things in long and deliberate shots to allow the things in the darkness to slowly appear. Technically, the film does have some problems from an effects angle, but it's very negligible. Also, the only things keeping this from being a PG-13 film are a few obscenities that get thrown around and a scene of brief nudity. It sets a certain expectation when you have an R-rated supernatural thriller and it doesn't deliver on the bloody thrills, and that's also going to alienate some of the potential audience. And from a storytelling standpoint, the twist that comes before the climax of the film was delivered with great effect, but that effect should have kept the momentum going through the remainder of the film rather than being stronger than the climax. The final confrontation of the story will definitely leave more casual horror fans disappointed due to its complete lack of visceral joy, but fans of good storytelling will appreciate they went for something that was more in line with the story this film is telling rather than going to a lowest-common-denominator ""Hasta La Vista, baby"" type of ending.Frankly, this is a film that fans of supernatural horror won't care for at all, and also people with shorter attention spans.INTRUDERS is very much a scary bedtime story that a child's imagination would concoct, and it allows all of us to identify with that child in all of us that despite ourselves and our fears, would create our own terrifying tales that we would eventually find the strength to fight our way out of.",4,"""I know Hollowface doesn't exist.

1539208,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,B007W41B0U,John's Horror Corner,"[5, 6]","It took me a long time to deduce the point of this movie.  Once I did, there was no satisfaction as there should have been.  It's not that anything was presented poorly, per se.  I think it's that they failed to present what they needed to in order to sell me on this story.The opening scene of this movie casts a less serious mood than one would expect from an R-rated horror.  Two children (one 12, one 8) living in different countries (England and Spain) are visited nightly by a faceless being who wants to take possession of them.  Each child has found a convincingly similar story about the faceless fiend.  Quickly quelling this immature storytelling notion is the disturbing faceless imagery of ""Hollowface,"" our spectral intruder.The parents of each child have their own passed-down methods of alleviating their children's fears: nostalgic children's books, burning an effigy (a bit extreme if you ask me), closing your eyes and counting to five--none of them seem to work.  Then some strange things start happening with the parents, too: a near death experience for Clive Owen's work buddy and Juan's mom has some issues finding credibility claiming demonic possession.The children's childish(?) fears worsen toward mania and the parents have difficulty handling their terror.  But what happens when the parents start seeing the same thing?  Both children's parents adopt increasingly paranoid, but protective, behavior.  The British family turns to the police, the Spanish family to the church; both fail to find credibility in the parents' story which, in their mind, is a case of the children's story ""infecting"" the parents.  When efforts to help these families inexplicably fail, they are considered crazy and/or psychological explanations are forced upon them.Throughout the process the audience questions the notion of ""Hollowface.""  Is it just a common term (i.e., a title like the boogeyman) used by some analyst through whose eyes we perceive this story (i.e., this movie's perspective).  Or is the story told through the eyes of the children and parents?  Or just the children?  Or just the parents?  Is the common element between both families--this specific, named villain with an unmistakable appearance--the clue that tells us that this is really happening to these people?  Or is it just a device, a paralleling machination dreamt up by a screenplay writer or director to lead us into one sense of awareness and comfortable conclusion before pulling the rug out from under our feet?The mystery is revealed to us, and gracefully so.

Intruders tells the story of a young boy and girl that are haunted by Hollow Face, a faceless, ghostly figure searching for a face of his own.First, I really enjoyed the story, although it is a bit predictable. Hollow Face is a creepy character as he swiftly moves and haunts the characters; the first time John (Clive Owen) and his daughter see ghost face creep out of the closet is dreadfully tense and one of my favorite scenes in the movie. But, Hollow Face would've been better if they used better effects like an actual costume instead of obvious computer effect; Hollow Face feels out of place because of the effects, in my opinion. The story has plenty of tense and spooky moments, although it has some typical horror clich&eacute;s. The ending was great, and I really enjoyed the music that compliments it. The acting was great, and the music was very well done. It delivers some great scares, but it won't keep you up at night.Overall, Intruders tells a great story and effectively uses Hollow Face most of the time, although obvious computer effects and some clich&eacute;s hold the film back.

Over the decades, there have been horror story anthologies and horror short story magazines.  I know there are plenty of horror novels as well, but really, in the grand scheme, a great, well-told and to-the-point horror story just doesn't take very long to articulate effectively.It's much the same with horror movies.  While over the history of cinema, there have been plenty of good full-length horror movies...the stinkers far outweigh the classics.  (Please note, I'm not even thinking of slasher movies in all this.  Different genre, IMO.)  A very recent example is THE WOMAN IN BLACK (with Daniel Radcliffe).  It very effectively built an atmosphere.  It established a good setting and backstory.  It introduced a likeable character.  And then it dragged on and on...with the same basic scares over and over.  What started out so well was finally over-stuffed needlessly in order to get it to be ""full length.""  THE OTHERS (with Nicole Kidman) could have been half the length and twice as effective.And the same is true with INTRUDERS.  There is much to admire here.  An excellent, effectively creepy beginning.  Some fine atmospherics.  Acceptable performances (although I would not cast Carice Van Houten in anything where she speaks in English).  The movie simply takes to long so that when the climax and revelations come at the end...we've nearly stopped caring and the ""twist"" ending isn't strong enough to support a 90 minute build-up.So often with horror movies, the ending feels lame because we've invested so much time in getting there.  Imagine if the film were only 45 minutes instead of 90.  You'd be more tolerant.  I know this sounds shallow, but I believe it is true.  Having watched plenty of half-hearted episodes of MASTERS OF HORROR (coming in just under 1 hour)...I'm much more forgiving of their plot shortcomings than if they had padded by 30 more minutes.INTRUDERS has an intriguing story and introduces a creepy villian, namely Hollow Face, who seems determined to literally take away the faces (or at least senses) of its young targets.  Half the film takes place in Spain, and features a young boy and his mother, as they attempt to use the church to help them fight the horror that the boy alone sees.  Half the film is in England, where Clive Owen and his teen daughter both see the frightful creature, and attempt to use science and police work to battle it.It was all interesting enough, but then merely became repetitive.  ""He's in my closet!""  YIKES!!  Next day: ""He's in my closet!""  HO-HUM.  INTRUDERS is simply a ghost story with too thin a plot (and not enough legitimate scares) to really be worth your time.

Spain has quietly been putting together a solid horror environment over the past decade or so (as long as you ignore Jaume Balaguero's attempts at direction that do not involve Paco Plaza); Fresnadillo tapped into that same well, and ended up with the same strengths (fantastic atmosphere--Spanish horror directors, in the main, have learned very well from the Southeast Asian horror contingent) and weaknesses (unfortunately, he forgot to include a plot) that mark such overlooked Spanish horror flicks as Eskalofrio and Hierro.Our parallel plot introduces two families--one Spanish, one British--who seem to be haunted by the same hooded, faceless apparition who looks a whole lot like classic depictions of Death (without the scythe).

In England, a second storyline follows John Farrow (Croupier's Clive Owen) and his wife Susanna (Black Death's Carice van Houten), whose twelve-year-old daughter, Mia (Never Let Me Go's Ella Purnell), is haunted by a ghost she calls Hollowman. While Susanna does not believe, John does, and much of this part of the movie focuses less on the hauntings than on John's attempts to convince Susanna and Mia's doctor (An Angel at My Table's Kerry Fox) that she's not hallucinating. (One of the best things about Casariego and Marques' script is a parallel between Farrow trying to convince people Hollowface DOES exist and Luisa attempting to convince the family priest, played by White Smoke's H&eacute;ctor Alterio, that Hollowface doesn't exist. Which, of course, she doesn't believe...)The main problem with Intruders is a very simple one: the one-two punch of plot twists at the end of the film (and they come in quick succession) just isn't punchy enough to hold up the entire movie, even if you never saw 'em coming. While Owen and van Houten are exemplary at combining eye candy with acting chops, the movie's not worth it for an hour and a half of Owen trying to punch ghosts, even if he does look very good doing it. Well-acted, well-shot, and chock full of atmosphere, but ultimately trite. ** ",3,"Got the Humanoid, Not the Intruder...",1377820800,"08 30, 2013",2013,2694,"['Intruders', 'Juan', 'Carlos', 'Fresnadillo', '2011', 'Fresnadillo', '2001', 'thriller', 'Intacto', 'kicked', 'off', 'five', 'years', 'fantastic', 'Eurocrime', 'thrillers', 'followed', 'up', 'being', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'shooting', '28', 'Days', 'franchise', 'Danny', 'Boyle', 'was', 'latest', 'offering', 'Intruders', 'ghost', 'story', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'two', 'features', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'bad', 'may', 'have', 'heard', 'Spain', 'quietly', 'been', 'putting', 'together', 'solid', 'horror', 'environment', 'past', 'decade', 'so', 'as', 'long', 'ignore', 'Jaume', 'Balaguero', 'attempts', 'direction', 'do', 'not', 'involve', 'Paco', 'Plaza', 'Fresnadillo', 'tapped', 'same', 'well', 'ended', 'up', 'same', 'strengths', 'fantastic', 'atmosphere', 'Spanish', 'horror', 'directors', 'main', 'have', 'learned', 'very', 'well', 'Southeast', 'Asian', 'horror', 'contingent', 'weaknesses', 'unfortunately', 'forgot', 'include', 'plot', 'mark', 'such', 'overlooked', 'Spanish', 'horror', 'flicks', 'Eskalofrio', 'Hierro.Our', 'parallel', 'plot', 'introduces', 'two', 'families', 'one', 'Spanish', 'one', 'British', 'who', 'seem', 'be', 'haunted', 'same', 'hooded', 'faceless', 'apparition', 'who', 'whole', 'lot', 'classic', 'depictions', 'Death', 'scythe', 'Spain', 'mom', 'Luisa', 'Alatriste', 'Pilar', 'L', 'oacute', 'Ayala', 'telling', 'son', 'Juan', 'Audacia', 'Iz', 'aacute', 'Corchero', 'apparition', 'who', 'Juan', 'Hollowface', ""n't"", 'exist', 'mannerisms', 'belie', 'words', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'England', 'second', 'storyline', 'John', 'Farrow', 'Croupier', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'wife', 'Susanna', 'Black', 'Death', 'Carice', 'van', 'Houten', 'twelve-year-old', 'daughter', 'Mia', 'Never', 'Let', 'Me', 'Go', 'Ella', 'Purnell', 'haunted', 'ghost', 'Hollowman', 'Susanna', 'not', 'believe', 'John', 'much', 'part', 'movie', 'less', 'hauntings', 'John', 'attempts', 'convince', 'Susanna', 'Mia', 'doctor', 'Angel', 'My', 'Table', 'Kerry', 'Fox', 'not', 'hallucinating', 'One', 'best', 'things', 'Casariego', 'Marques', 'script', 'parallel', 'Farrow', 'trying', 'convince', 'people', 'Hollowface', 'DOES', 'exist', 'Luisa', 'attempting', 'convince', 'family', 'priest', 'played', 'White', 'Smoke', 'H', 'eacute', 'ctor', 'Alterio', 'Hollowface', ""n't"", 'exist', 'Which', 'course', ""n't"", 'believe', 'main', 'problem', 'Intruders', 'very', 'simple', 'one', 'one-two', 'punch', 'plot', 'twists', 'end', 'film', 'come', 'quick', 'succession', 'just', ""n't"", 'punchy', 'enough', 'hold', 'up', 'entire', 'movie', 'even', 'never', 'saw', 'coming', 'Owen', 'van', 'Houten', 'are', 'exemplary', 'combining', 'eye', 'candy', 'acting', 'chops', 'movie', 'not', 'worth', 'hour', 'half', 'Owen', 'trying', 'punch', 'ghosts', 'even', 'look', 'very', 'good', 'doing', 'Well-acted', 'well-shot', 'chock', 'full', 'atmosphere', 'ultimately', 'trite', '**']",N/A

Presented in Spanish and English the film tells two stories simultaneously.The first story involves a little boy(Iz&aacute;n Corchero) in Spain troubled by nightmares. The latest nightmare involves a faceless that the boy begins writing stories about that he calleds ""hollow face"". The creature returns again and again to the boy's home to try and take his identity by stealing the boy's face. The boy's mother (Pilar L&oacute;pez de Ayala)also encounters the creature and contacts a priest (Daniel Br&uuml;hl)to help drive the creature away.The second story focuses on a girl (Carice van Houten) who finds herself haunted by the same creature. The only problem is that no one will believe her except her father (Clive Owen)who also sees the creature.Director Fresnadillo does a good job of keeping us guessing as to who or what the creature. In a fractured story like this that takes place across two different countries the director runs the risk of losing the audience but Fresnadillo and the writers of the film do an exceptional job of tying to stories together.The Blu-ray transfer of the film is often quite stunning. The presentation has nice detail throughout and although the image is occasionally a bit soft, the muted colors and presentation of the film appears to be quite true to the original theatrical presentation of the film.The lossless audio sounds marvelous and the surround mix puts you right smack dab in the middle of the action.The special features for those that pay attention to such things will leave viewers wanting more. We get two featurettes on the production of the film: the first is a nine minute featurette featuring interviews with the cast and crew discussing what attracted them to the project; the second featurette runs a good twenty minutes featuring a good amount of behind-the-scenes footage intercut with further interviews.It's a pity we don't get a commentary track or a deeper examination of the themes of the film but what really matters here, ultimately, is the quality of the film and whether or not it's worth watching more than once. ""Intruders"" is a suspenseful and well made film that will keep most fans of thrillers guessing.Although the third act doesn't quite build on the power of the first two thirds of the film ""Intruders"" still manages to be an involving thriller.Recommended.",3,"Two children threatened by a faceless, nameless entity and the parents that try to protect them in involving thriller",1342915200,"07 22, 2012",2012,2553,"['Intruders', 'atmospheric', 'thriller', 'director', 'Juan', 'Carlos', 'Fresnadillo', '28', 'Weeks', 'Later', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'episode', 'Night', 'Gallery', 'directed', 'Guillermo', 'Del', 'Toro', 'Pan', 'Labyrinth', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'Presented', 'Spanish', 'English', 'film', 'two', 'stories', 'simultaneously.The', 'first', 'story', 'little', 'boy', 'Iz', 'aacute', 'Corchero', 'Spain', 'troubled', 'nightmares', 'latest', 'nightmare', 'faceless', 'boy', 'writing', 'stories', 'hollow', 'face', 'creature', 'again', 'again', 'boy', 'home', 'try', 'take', 'identity', 'stealing', 'boy', 'face', 'boy', 'mother', 'Pilar', 'L', 'oacute', 'Ayala', 'also', 'creature', 'priest', 'Daniel', 'Br', 'uuml', 'hl', 'help', 'drive', 'creature', 'away.The', 'second', 'story', 'focuses', 'girl', 'Carice', 'van', 'Houten', 'who', 'haunted', 'same', 'creature', 'only', 'problem', 'one', 'will', 'believe', 'father', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'who', 'also', 'creature.Director', 'Fresnadillo', 'good', 'job', 'keeping', 'guessing', 'who', 'what', 'creature', 'fractured', 'story', 'place', 'two', 'different', 'countries', 'director', 'risk', 'losing', 'audience', 'Fresnadillo', 'writers', 'film', 'do', 'exceptional', 'job', 'tying', 'stories', 'together.The', 'Blu-ray', 'transfer', 'film', 'often', 'quite', 'stunning', 'presentation', 'nice', 'detail', 'image', 'occasionally', 'bit', 'soft', 'muted', 'colors', 'presentation', 'film', 'be', 'quite', 'true', 'original', 'theatrical', 'presentation', 'film.The', 'lossless', 'audio', 'marvelous', 'surround', 'mix', 'right', 'smack', 'dab', 'middle', 'action.The', 'special', 'features', 'pay', 'attention', 'such', 'things', 'will', 'leave', 'viewers', 'wanting', 'more', 'get', 'two', 'featurettes', 'production', 'film', 'first', 'nine', 'minute', 'featurette', 'featuring', 'interviews', 'cast', 'crew', 'discussing', 'what', 'attracted', 'project', 'second', 'featurette', 'good', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'featuring', 'good', 'amount', 'behind-the-scenes', 'footage', 'intercut', 'further', 'interviews.It', 'pity', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'commentary', 'track', 'deeper', 'examination', 'themes', 'film', 'what', 'really', 'matters', 'here', 'ultimately', 'quality', 'film', 'not', 'worth', 'watching', 'more', 'once', 'Intruders', 'suspenseful', 'well', 'made', 'film', 'will', 'keep', 'most', 'fans', 'thrillers', 'guessing.Although', 'third', 'act', ""n't"", 'quite', 'build', 'power', 'first', 'two', 'thirds', 'film', 'Intruders', 'still', 'be', 'involving', 'thriller.Recommended']",N/A
