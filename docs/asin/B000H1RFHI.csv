1008924,A3ANETCTMAN1NP,B000H1RFHI,&#308;&#308;,"[0, 0]","Having enjoyed a lot of Crunch fitness DVDs, I was very hopeful that I would enjoy this one, as well.  Unfortunately the fitness moves used were so extremely basic, boring, and low impact that I found myself eagerly anticipating the end of the routine.The instructor, Lizbeth Garcia, was a good instructor.  She would often preview what she wanted the viewer to do so that there would be no confusion, and she was pleasantly motivatng.  She starts out with a good warm up, teaching mambos, squats, and V-steps before finishing the warm up with some stretching.  After the warm up, the workout is divided into 6 sections:Latin Dance 1 - This is very, very basic dancing with some easy mambos and triple steps.  My heart rate did not get up much at all, and I was very bored since just 2-3 steps were taught.Latin Dance 2 - This added 1-2 more moves onto the first moves that you learned, creating a short dance routine.  It was just more mambos and triple steps, which did not get my heart rate up any more, nor did it make me have any more fun.  At the end of this section you do your first ""cardio burst"" which is 60 seconds of one move that is supposed to really burn fat.  It was simply a lunge and triple step that finally got my heart rate up.Thai Boxing 1 - My heart rate quickly went down again as I started this section which only taught a bob and weave, a heel tap, and a knee thrust.Thai Boxing 2 - You finally start to box in this section as you learn an uppercut, a hook punch, and a boxer's shuffle.  This got my heart rate up, and my heart rate stayed up through the cardio burst, which were some knee thrusts and runs.Sweatshop 1 - My heart rate continued to remain high into this section where the grapevine, hamstring curls, and V-step were introduced.Sweatshop 2 - Then, like the Latin Dance section, more moves were added onto the first moves, making this like a routine.  Lunges, kicks, and step touches were the moves that were added before finishing the cardio workout with the last power burst, which was made up of skates and step touches.After the workout, you finish off with a cool-down and ab workout.  I really liked the cool-down; I found it to be sufficient with some back and leg stretches.  I would have enjoyed some arm stretches thrown in there, though.  The ab workout was on a mat and consisted of basic crunches that didn't work me out too much.  After the crunches, you do more stretching on the mat.Overall, it was a decent workout for beginners, but if you are experienced with fitness at all, give this one a pass.",3,"Great for beginners, but horrible for everyone else",1292976000,"12 22, 2010",2010,2556,"['Having', 'enjoyed', 'lot', 'Crunch', 'fitness', 'DVDs', 'was', 'very', 'hopeful', 'would', 'enjoy', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'Unfortunately', 'fitness', 'moves', 'used', 'were', 'so', 'extremely', 'basic', 'boring', 'low', 'impact', 'found', 'eagerly', 'anticipating', 'end', 'routine.The', 'instructor', 'Lizbeth', 'Garcia', 'was', 'good', 'instructor', 'would', 'often', 'preview', 'what', 'wanted', 'viewer', 'do', 'so', 'would', 'be', 'confusion', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'motivatng', 'out', 'good', 'warm', 'up', 'teaching', 'mambos', 'squats', 'V-steps', 'finishing', 'warm', 'up', 'stretching', 'warm', 'up', 'workout', 'divided', '6', 'sections', 'Latin', 'Dance', '1', 'very', 'very', 'basic', 'dancing', 'easy', 'mambos', 'triple', 'steps', 'heart', 'rate', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'up', 'much', 'was', 'very', 'bored', 'just', '2-3', 'steps', 'were', 'taught.Latin', 'Dance', '2', 'added', '1-2', 'more', 'moves', 'first', 'learned', 'creating', 'short', 'dance', 'routine', 'was', 'just', 'more', 'mambos', 'triple', 'steps', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'heart', 'rate', 'more', 'did', 'make', 'have', 'more', 'fun', 'end', 'section', 'do', 'first', 'cardio', 'burst', '60', 'seconds', 'one', 'move', 'supposed', 'really', 'burn', 'fat', 'was', 'simply', 'lunge', 'triple', 'step', 'finally', 'got', 'heart', 'rate', 'up.Thai', 'Boxing', '1', 'heart', 'rate', 'quickly', 'went', 'down', 'again', 'started', 'section', 'only', 'taught', 'bob', 'weave', 'heel', 'tap', 'knee', 'thrust.Thai', 'Boxing', '2', 'finally', 'start', 'box', 'section', 'learn', 'uppercut', 'hook', 'punch', 'boxer', 'shuffle', 'got', 'heart', 'rate', 'heart', 'rate', 'stayed', 'up', 'cardio', 'burst', 'were', 'knee', 'thrusts', 'runs.Sweatshop', '1', 'heart', 'rate', 'continued', 'remain', 'high', 'section', 'where', 'grapevine', 'hamstring', 'curls', 'V-step', 'were', 'introduced.Sweatshop', '2', 'Then', 'Latin', 'Dance', 'section', 'more', 'moves', 'were', 'added', 'first', 'moves', 'making', 'routine', 'Lunges', 'kicks', 'step', 'touches', 'were', 'moves', 'were', 'added', 'finishing', 'cardio', 'workout', 'last', 'power', 'burst', 'was', 'made', 'skates', 'step', 'touches.After', 'workout', 'finish', 'off', 'cool-down', 'ab', 'workout', 'really', 'liked', 'cool-down', 'found', 'be', 'sufficient', 'back', 'leg', 'stretches', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'arm', 'stretches', 'thrown', 'there', 'ab', 'workout', 'was', 'mat', 'consisted', 'basic', 'crunches', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'too', 'much', 'crunches', 'do', 'more', 'stretching', 'mat.Overall', 'was', 'decent', 'workout', 'beginners', 'are', 'experienced', 'fitness', 'give', 'one', 'pass']",Crunch: Fat Burning Blast

I don't really enjoy the latin section though.  Honestly, it didn't challenge me as much physically as the other sections did and, admittedly I am not the world's most coordinated person, but I couldn't really follow it.  If you were a better dancer I think that you may enjoy it but for me it was just frustrating.  The way the video is set up is that the ab section is after the cool down.  I just do the abs either before my workout or right before the cooldown, because by the time I do the cooldown I just want to be done.  I started exercising again with this video and the cooldown/stretching is very short but when I do it I am never uncomfortably sore the next day so it is very worth it.  I have a really weak upper body so I felt the workout in my arms and shoulders but for more of a challenge you could add some light hand weights and really increase the intensity level.  The instructor is upbeat and positive without being over the top, and I really like how she will tell you what is coming up next since it makes it go by so much faster for me.  Also, she does 60 second power bursts at the end of the sections that will really get your heart rate up.
