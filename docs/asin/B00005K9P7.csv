A complete stranger who he knows for less than a few minutes.  Was penpal Anne Hechte's character that desireable?  The job search to become a liquor/deli store clerk or bust, seemed painfully degrading for this sucessful insurance executive who did not seem unhappy with his former life.  The policeman who keeps his eye on Goldblum, seemingly knowing what is happening inside him while he undergoes this identity change, was also hard to buy.  He had no motivation to do this as it did not appear that a crime was or would be committed.

That is because the cable industry will frequently take a chance on a script with less than blockbuster appeal.  This film is a case in point with Jeff Goldblum given a chance to develop his acting chops by playing insurance executive John Nolan, who becomes more and more obssesed with the life of the late Auggie Rose. Rose died as a result of a deli-liquor hold up when Nolan was in the store.  Nolan feels guilty about Rose's death because he had made Rose replace a bottle, which startled the robber into shooting.  However, guilt quickly turns into something more as Nolan starts taking over Rose's life, including meeting the woman Rose corresponded with but never met.  Nolan becomes Rose when he meets her.  Probably we could have used more motivation for the Nolan character's extraordinary choices throughout the film but Goldblum makes it work, that this guy wants out of his present life.  Heche is very good as the girlfriend.  Goldblum and Heche are quite equal in their roles, both showing a great deal of acting talent and character development.  Some harder edges and clearer motivation in the script would have pushed it up to a 5 star movie.

Middleton,"[12, 12]","This unusual and truly noteworthy film recently landed in our video shop without the trumpet blast that new releases usually carry along with them. A long time fan of Jeff Goldblum and a budding fan of Anne Heche, feeling adventurous and somewhat bored, I thought I would give it a try and haven't regretted the decision for a second.This is a story about identity, love, emotional crises and that time of life (some point between thirty-five and forty) where some of us get hit with a major wake up call, and decide to throw in the old life and start a new one. Please do not let this general description of ~Auggie Rose~ put you off - because it is not your run of the mill comedy/drama, but something a lot more.The plot is basic with a touch of originality: John Nolan (Jeff Goldblum) is a successful life insurance salesman that one night walks into his local liquor store to buy some special wine he has ordered. He notices that the label is damaged and asks for another bottle. The assistant walks in the back to retrieve it when the place gets robbed. The assistant, unaware of the crime in progress, walks back out to the counter and the shooter pops him one. Nolan holds the man in his arms and accompanies him to the hospital where he dies. While in the process of dying, a connection is made between Nolan and the victim, Auggie Rose, who turns out to be an ex con, recently released from a twenty year prison sentence. He feels somehow responsible for the murder and begins investigating the man's life. The more Nolan learns about Auggie, the more inextricably drawn into his life he becomes. The journey of obsession begins.After a chain of subtle stimulators and interesting circumstances, Nolan is pulled even further into Auggie's life, and assumes his identity. And the trouble starts.This film had all the charm and strangeness of a Paul Auster novel. Specifically, his early books like 'The Music of Chance' or 'Moon Palace'. I really can't compare ~Auggie Rose~ to Auster's film 'Smoke' for example, but their ambience or general atmosphere are very similar. This film lacks that mainstream gloss and has real depth without being mawkish. (More cynical viewers might diasagree) The original soundtrack helps to create that feeling of strangeness, and is an excellent piece of work in its own right.Anne Heche's performance is polished and quite charming as Auggie's prison pen pal: meeting Nolan, believing it is Auggie and the relationship ensues. Surprising to some, Goldblum and Heche mesh as their on screen presence as lover's works well.Writer/director, Mathew Tabak, is unknown to me, but if this is his first major instalment into the Hollywood arena, he has a great career in front of him.This film deserves to be seen.",4,Unusual and charming...,1015804800,"03 11, 2002",2002,2750,"['unusual', 'truly', 'noteworthy', 'film', 'recently', 'landed', 'video', 'shop', 'trumpet', 'blast', 'new', 'releases', 'usually', 'carry', 'along', 'A', 'long', 'time', 'fan', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'budding', 'fan', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'feeling', 'adventurous', 'somewhat', 'bored', 'thought', 'would', 'give', 'try', 'have', ""n't"", 'regretted', 'decision', 'second.This', 'story', 'identity', 'love', 'emotional', 'crises', 'time', 'life', 'point', 'thirty-five', 'forty', 'where', 'get', 'hit', 'major', 'wake', 'up', 'call', 'decide', 'throw', 'old', 'life', 'start', 'new', 'one', 'Please', 'do', 'not', 'let', 'general', 'description', '~Auggie', 'Rose~', 'put', 'off', 'not', 'run', 'mill', 'comedy/drama', 'something', 'lot', 'more.The', 'plot', 'basic', 'touch', 'originality', 'John', 'Nolan', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'successful', 'life', 'insurance', 'salesman', 'one', 'night', 'walks', 'local', 'liquor', 'store', 'buy', 'special', 'wine', 'ordered', 'label', 'damaged', 'bottle', 'assistant', 'walks', 'back', 'retrieve', 'when', 'place', 'robbed', 'assistant', 'unaware', 'crime', 'progress', 'walks', 'back', 'counter', 'shooter', 'one', 'Nolan', 'man', 'arms', 'hospital', 'where', 'process', 'dying', 'connection', 'made', 'Nolan', 'victim', 'Auggie', 'Rose', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'ex', 'con', 'recently', 'released', 'twenty', 'year', 'prison', 'sentence', 'somehow', 'responsible', 'murder', 'investigating', 'man', 'life', 'more', 'Nolan', 'Auggie', 'more', 'inextricably', 'drawn', 'life', 'journey', 'obsession', 'begins.After', 'chain', 'subtle', 'stimulators', 'interesting', 'circumstances', 'Nolan', 'pulled', 'even', 'further', 'Auggie', 'life', 'identity', 'trouble', 'starts.This', 'film', 'had', 'charm', 'strangeness', 'Paul', 'Auster', 'novel', 'Specifically', 'early', 'books', ""'The"", 'Music', 'Chance', 'Palace', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', '~Auggie', 'Rose~', 'Auster', 'film', ""'Smoke"", 'example', 'ambience', 'general', 'atmosphere', 'are', 'very', 'similar', 'film', 'mainstream', 'gloss', 'real', 'depth', 'being', 'mawkish', 'More', 'cynical', 'viewers', 'might', 'diasagree', 'original', 'soundtrack', 'create', 'feeling', 'strangeness', 'excellent', 'piece', 'work', 'own', 'right.Anne', 'Heche', 'performance', 'polished', 'quite', 'charming', 'Auggie', 'prison', 'pen', 'pal', 'meeting', 'Nolan', 'believing', 'Auggie', 'relationship', 'ensues', 'Surprising', 'Goldblum', 'Heche', 'mesh', 'screen', 'presence', 'lover', 'works', 'well.Writer/director', 'Mathew', 'Tabak', 'unknown', 'first', 'major', 'instalment', 'Hollywood', 'arena', 'great', 'career', 'front', 'him.This', 'film', 'deserves', 'be', 'seen']",N/A

Physically he is unscathed, but a recently hired store assistant, Augie Rose, is killed by the assailant, practically dying in Nolan's arms with the words ""John, it'll be OK"".  Mentally injured and haunted by these events, and disturbed by the callousness and inability of the police department to make proper arrangements for a funeral and the personal effects of Rose, Nolan pursues the matter himself.  He learns that Rose spent 20 years in prison for armed robbery, aggravated by a history of previous petty crimes, has no next of kin, and was released from prison three weeks ago.  By signing as a brother, he gets the personal effects no one else wants.  Thus he finds the apartment.  And so the involvement cascades.  With each discovery, Nolan entangles himself ever deeper in the web of Rose's prior life.This film is not a crime story about bringing a murderous assailant to justice; that's not even part of the script.  The Tony's Deli incident merely sets in motion what becomes a psychological obsession (""Suspicion"" is a misnomer!) in a willing individual and the consequences thereof.  Nolan has the option on several occasions of withdrawing from this obsession, but he deliberately chooses to go completely overboard in the opposite direction.Aside from the necessity of having a plot for this film, why would the Nolan character have this obsession and be so willing to abandon his cushy life style?  There are some good answers presented here: a personal feeling of guilt that he was in some fateful way responsible (After all, if he had accepted the bottle of wine as is and left immediately, the incident likely would have been nothing more than a routine street-punk robbery.); a deep sense of injustice relative to the mindless consequences of this random killing and his desire to mitigate it if he can; a cooling of ardor toward his housemate Carol, whom he has been dating for 6 years but never married; the dull grind of the life insurance business; a life where importance is measured by whether or not a wine bottle's label is scratched (and how fate hangs in the balance on that trivial detail!); an existentialist mindset where there is no longer meaning or purpose in his middle-aged life, with little more to achieve beyond marriage, a house in the suburbs, a flashy Volvo, and monetary independence.  Perhaps he sees in the deceased a way to escape his own human predicament: engagement.Goldblum's acting ability is particularly well suited to this type of role, which is strongly reminiscent of that in ""Into the Night"".  In both films, his character becomes disenfranchised from the daily grind and departs to greener pastures, getting in way over his head in the process.  Those who enjoyed one film will likely enjoy the other.The 1.85-1.00 picture is crisp with good color and detail.  The Dolby 5.1 Stereo Surround track is fine.  The DVD keep-case is good.
