The conversation between the Judge and the Mayor by way of the City Hall exchange though each is in an adjoining booth at the city airport is hilarious. Just one of the clever twists in the tale.A family film!",5,"Now we know as to why Clarke Gable was ""King"" in his time",1371081600,"06 13, 2013",2013,342,"['excellent', 'film', 'humour', 'moral', 'story', 'City', 'Hall', 'corruption', 'cast', ""'zing"", 'one', 'roles', 'conversation', 'Judge', 'Mayor', 'way', 'City', 'Hall', 'exchange', 'adjoining', 'booth', 'city', 'airport', 'hilarious', 'Just', 'one', 'clever', 'tale.A', 'family', 'film']",N/A

I saw years ago..its a fun film..its almost unbelievable in too many ways..yet your drawn in by the performances..romance is what all these films are about, certainly some of the better ones. Cities are what the ancient world, was about, and nowadays with competing cities this film and a focus on the background and the romance which is in the story..interests and engages us even more.LOretta young appears at first against the backdrop of San FRancisco and Chinatown which appears in the film and the police and fire and all the city services which are always at themayors reach..especially the fire chief..loretta appears like lucille buttoned up and Gable first appears and sees that he must change her wardrobe and it exists throughout forces him to gaze through his eyes..and they talk..shes that kind of girl..thats how she engages her male interlocutors the few she meets and glance back,,,and herespects and remembers her..she has a scarf..and later a kerchief and her hair is always tied up in a bun..never down across her shoulders..the clothes are all too business like and the various wardrobe sais much in this film as the persons seem almost like talking through their wardrobe they play the part they dress..like LOretta..the ""facts' like in DIckens Coketown..the film begins and shes all facts too Gables brawn, a self made man, and she later falls for him and they marry i would like to think its a romantic film and it is but the romance never convinces the script is something like she marries him for being all brawn..like the brawn pierces to some unknown depth..and the film is really a drama..and its comedy here..the arrangement of the marriage and how they pull it off with marilyn maxwell(always the good comedienne bob hope liked to have her along shes good for so many ways sensual off putting and funny) and raymond burr as a heavy..these minor characters do the film well..one reviewer finds the romance bland..sure is and it doesnt succeed well there as the film begins with the virile male and the single aesthete Young(and she plays the part well which improves this film)..there are many good comedic scenes..the chinatown restaurant scene being one..the burlesque type dance with the baloons..the waterfront..there's much here..it plays well at times..a film about the machinations of  amarriage and city politics,,the politics is all to real..even as a key to the orient..why she likes him i never really got and he her seems almost medieval..maybe thats the romances MAYORS have..the violent scene at the end seems out of place with a fight with hooks..thereis much bravado and fights..the Young character comments on the violence showing the virility of the Gable character..hooks..and at the end he certainly does hook her..a fun film the various elements mix well one of Gables more enjoyable 50's films and still worth looking at today..",4,still enjoyable and modern in ways after all these years,1368921600,"05

When small-town mayor Steve Fisk (Gable) arrives at a national mayors' convention in San Fancisco, he meets attractive Clarissa Standish (Young), mayor of Winonah, Maine.  They are from completely different backgrounds -- she's a Harvard law school grad, he's a roughneck ex-longshoreman -- but they are both honest politicians.Steve invites Clarissa to dine at a rowdy nightclub, which lands them both in jail.  Their arrests make the morning papers, Clarissa finds herself falling for Steve, and she's forced to choose between love and duty when the scandal threatens both of their careers.  Co-starring Raymond Burr (TV's Perry Mason), ""Key to the City"" also marked the final screen appearance of Frank Morgan (the title character in ""The Wizard of Oz"").  Three years later, Loretta Young would abandon her big-screen career and turn to television with a top-rated, long-running NBC anthology series.There are no bonus extras.",4,Oil & Water Romantic Comedy Has Charm,1365379200,"04 8, 2013",2013,1091,"['Key', 'City', '1950', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'starring', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'Loretta', 'Young', 'first', 'final', 'screen', 'pairing', 'Call', 'Wild', '1935', 'When', 'small-town', 'mayor', 'Steve', 'Fisk', 'Gable', 'national', 'mayors', 'convention', 'San', 'Fancisco', 'attractive', 'Clarissa', 'Standish', 'Young', 'mayor', 'Winonah', 'Maine', 'are', 'completely', 'different', 'backgrounds', 'Harvard', 'law', 'school', 'grad', 'roughneck', 'ex-longshoreman', 'are', 'honest', 'politicians.Steve', 'Clarissa', 'dine', 'rowdy', 'nightclub', 'jail', 'arrests', 'make', 'morning', 'papers', 'Clarissa', 'falling', 'Steve', 'forced', 'choose', 'love', 'duty', 'when', 'scandal', 'careers', 'Co-starring', 'Raymond', 'Burr', 'TV', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'Key', 'City', 'also', 'marked', 'final', 'screen', 'appearance', 'Frank', 'Morgan', 'title', 'character', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'Three', 'years', 'later', 'Loretta', 'Young', 'would', 'abandon', 'big-screen', 'career', 'turn', 'television', 'top-rated', 'long-running', 'NBC', 'anthology', 'are', 'bonus', 'extras']",N/A
