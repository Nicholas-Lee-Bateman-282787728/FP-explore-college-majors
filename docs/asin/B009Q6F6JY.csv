I am in the minority, but I really enjoyed ADV's dub of the original Saiyuki series, and lost interest in Reload/Gunlock due to the change in art, voice-acting (dub) and characterizations. When I heard that this was going to be released featuring the &#34;ancient past&#34; characters, whose appearances I greatly enjoyed in the original series, as well as the the original ADV voice acting, I was very excited. Unfortunately, what we got wasn't really up to par.I haven't read the Saiyuki Gaiden comics that these are based on, but I have seen the 3 episodes that cover their story-arc from the original series. However, instead of picking up where those stories left off, the first of the three episodes on the disc starts with a massive flashback that crams lots of information into a short amount of time. It's disconnected and jumbled, and it was hard to tell when the &#34;flachback&#34; stopped and when the actual episode began. The story is basically such that the four heroes have decided heaven is corrupt, and they want to escape.The characterizations seemed a little off to me. Saiyuki has always been a very &#34;bro-mantic&#34; type series, but sometimes the relationships and dialogue between the characters was a bit over-the-top, particularly between Konzen and Goku. It was also hard to feel invested in the story because I feel like we as the audience are just thrown into the climax of a bigger movie. The battle scenes are fun and well-animated, although the foursome are doomed from the start (which anyone familiar with who the characters are should know) so throughout the episodes they slowly are picked off or sacrifice themselves so the others can continue trying to escape.Overall, it was fun to see the characters brought to life again and it was an extra treat to have the original dub cast back, but the story was just a little too disjointed to really enjoy, and the characterizations struck me as off. I don't think I'll be watching this movie again, even though the artwork and animation is lovely and I really enjoy the &#34;ancient past&#34; characters that we rarely got to see from the original series. I'd reccomend this to hardcore Saiyuki fans only, and only as a rental.",2,"Odd Portrayal of Characters, Confusing Presentation",1403049600,"06 18, 2014",2014,2277,"['hate', 'rate', 'so', 'poorly', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'Saiyuki', 'am', 'minority', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'ADV', 'dub', 'original', 'Saiyuki', 'series', 'lost', 'interest', 'Reload/Gunlock', 'due', 'change', 'art', 'voice-acting', 'dub', 'characterizations', 'When', 'heard', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'released', 'featuring', '34', 'ancient', '34', 'characters', 'appearances', 'greatly', 'enjoyed', 'original', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'original', 'ADV', 'voice', 'acting', 'was', 'very', 'excited', 'Unfortunately', 'what', 'got', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'up', 'par.I', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'Saiyuki', 'Gaiden', 'comics', 'are', 'based', 'have', 'seen', '3', 'episodes', 'cover', 'story-arc', 'original', 'series', 'However', 'instead', 'picking', 'up', 'where', 'stories', 'left', 'off', 'first', 'three', 'episodes', 'disc', 'massive', 'flashback', 'lots', 'information', 'short', 'amount', 'time', 'disconnected', 'jumbled', 'was', 'hard', 'tell', 'when', '34', 'flachback', '34', 'stopped', 'when', 'actual', 'episode', 'began', 'story', 'basically', 'such', 'four', 'heroes', 'have', 'decided', 'heaven', 'corrupt', 'want', 'escape.The', 'characterizations', 'seemed', 'little', 'off', 'Saiyuki', 'always', 'been', 'very', '34', 'bro-mantic', '34', 'type', 'series', 'sometimes', 'relationships', 'dialogue', 'characters', 'was', 'bit', 'over-the-top', 'particularly', 'Konzen', 'Goku', 'was', 'also', 'hard', 'feel', 'invested', 'story', 'feel', 'audience', 'are', 'just', 'thrown', 'climax', 'bigger', 'movie', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'fun', 'well-animated', 'foursome', 'are', 'doomed', 'start', 'anyone', 'familiar', 'who', 'characters', 'are', 'should', 'know', 'so', 'episodes', 'slowly', 'are', 'picked', 'sacrifice', 'so', 'others', 'can', 'continue', 'trying', 'escape.Overall', 'was', 'fun', 'see', 'characters', 'brought', 'life', 'again', 'was', 'extra', 'treat', 'have', 'original', 'dub', 'cast', 'back', 'story', 'was', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'disjointed', 'really', 'enjoy', 'characterizations', 'struck', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'watching', 'movie', 'again', 'even', 'artwork', 'animation', 'lovely', 'really', 'enjoy', '34', 'ancient', '34', 'characters', 'rarely', 'got', 'see', 'original', 'series', ""'d"", 'reccomend', 'hardcore', 'Saiyuki', 'fans', 'only', 'only', 'rental']",Saiyuki Gaiden Complete Collection

For those who have not seen the previous volumes of the story I agree that it will make more sense if you watched them first before viewing this OVA.Be aware though that there is a lot of blood and gore during the fight scenes and there is some profanity so I do not recommend that children watch this.As a long time fan I was moved to tears at the ending.
