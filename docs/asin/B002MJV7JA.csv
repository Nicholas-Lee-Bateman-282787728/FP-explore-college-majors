Luckily though, it's not the worst show on television. Season 2 is still great. The dvd however is lacking. Just as the first season on dvd, it is censored and lacking in extras.

The 1 that will tug at the heart strings is the last episode when they go to New Orleans & help a family out who lost their home in the 2005 Katrina storm.No special extras.  A few deleted scenes & a video segment with Rob.Now, here are the problems with it 1.  EPISODES ARE NOT UNCUT.  Come on.  The Girls Next Door DVD's are uncut they have nudity & language.  Why is this show NOT shown uncut?  I am very disappointed in that. 2.  This HORRIBLE & CHEAP DVD case/holder.  It has intentional HOLES IN IT ON BOTH FRONT & BACK  Cheap, stupid & THOUGHTLESS 3.  No commentary as well on the episodesAt lease it does have a chapter/episode list.

1278289,A2C5VLIJMDPWHI,B002MJV7JA,"Shamontiel L. Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[0, 2]","I never knew who the Kardashians were. I'd heard about the Ray J. and Kim tape, but I still wasn't interested in them, and if not for me being too tired to change the channel, I'd have never run into a marathon of this show. The latest season seems pretty OK, and for the life of me, I can't figure out why people hate Kim Kardashian so much. She seems like the nicest one out of the entire family (minus Bruce). There's pretty much nothing Khloe could do to make me be interested in her on the show after watching how she made fun of her mother for incontinence. That was so uncool to me that I cringe every time I see her. And she wasn't much better on this season, but Kourtney bugs me even more. It's not just the nasally voice or the vulgar humor. It seems like Kourtney can NEVER make a decision on her own.When she thought Scott was cheating on her on this episode (and his excuses were absolutely lame), she wanted to talk to him on speaker phone in front of her sisters. Then, she wanted to talk to him on speaker phone again to let him know she was coming over only for Khloe's meddling self to jump in. Then, she wanted both of her sisters to go to dinner with her and Scott, but all the while she's screaming she's an adult. I went to high school with girls more mature than Kourtney. I just find how dependent she is to be painful to watch.Then watching those two be so disrespectful, immature and tacky at Bruce's cocktail dinner the night before his speech blew me away. Guys I run into who have nothing better to do than hang by train stations seem to have more class than the both of them put together. I'm hoping they're doing this for entertainment instead of really being real on this ""reality"" show.As far as Kim and her Bentley, I thought Kourtney and Khloe were ridiculous at the car shop, and I understood where Kim was coming from. I really don't understand why Kris lets them talk to her like she's a bum on the street (ironically enough, I found out on a later season that Khloe is much nicer to homeless people than her own mother), curse her out, hang up on her and she seems to take it all in stride.I was starting to wonder if this show was going to be a car crash through the entire DVD, but the scenes with Rob and his girlfriend were really cute. The tattoos were over the top but still cute. I like Bruce. I think Bruce is classy, entertaining and focused, although he's a bit of a pushover. (He looked good in his new wardrobe, minus that tight sweater.) Kim is cool, too. (FYI: I don't pay much attention to the younger girls.)Do I like the show? It's OK. A little awkward. The most uncomfortable episode was the one in New Orleans. Something just struck me as odd for the girl to ask for an autograph and immediately tell the Kardashians that they need to see all of the worst parts of Louisiana THEN take them to their trailer THEN tell them how rough it is for them and then be ""surprised"" when they wanted to help. Let's see. A bunch of reality stars with a camera in front of them? It came off as two opportunists as opposed to two people who were down on their luck and really didn't expect the Kardashians to help. I could be wrong. It could all be in the editing. But instead of feeling inspired by them helping out (like with the homeless guy on whatever season that was, or feeding the homeless [that girl who hung out with the two younger girls seemed genuine]), this one time felt like they were set up.",2,It's such an awkward show,1317772800,"10 5, 2011",2011,3452,"['never', 'knew', 'who', 'Kardashians', 'were', ""'d"", 'heard', 'Ray', 'J.', 'Kim', 'tape', 'still', 'was', ""n't"", 'interested', 'not', 'being', 'too', 'tired', 'change', 'channel', ""'d"", 'have', 'never', 'run', 'marathon', 'show', 'latest', 'season', 'pretty', 'OK', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'people', 'hate', 'Kim', 'Kardashian', 'so', 'much', 'nicest', 'one', 'out', 'entire', 'family', 'Bruce', 'pretty', 'much', 'nothing', 'Khloe', 'could', 'do', 'make', 'be', 'interested', 'show', 'watching', 'how', 'made', 'fun', 'mother', 'incontinence', 'was', 'so', 'uncool', 'cringe', 'time', 'see', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'better', 'season', 'Kourtney', 'even', 'more', 'not', 'just', 'nasally', 'voice', 'vulgar', 'humor', 'Kourtney', 'can', 'NEVER', 'make', 'decision', 'own.When', 'thought', 'Scott', 'was', 'cheating', 'episode', 'excuses', 'were', 'absolutely', 'lame', 'wanted', 'talk', 'speaker', 'phone', 'front', 'sisters', 'Then', 'wanted', 'talk', 'speaker', 'phone', 'again', 'let', 'know', 'was', 'coming', 'only', 'Khloe', 'meddling', 'self', 'jump', 'Then', 'wanted', 'sisters', 'go', 'dinner', 'Scott', 'screaming', 'adult', 'went', 'high', 'school', 'girls', 'more', 'mature', 'Kourtney', 'just', 'find', 'how', 'dependent', 'be', 'painful', 'watch.Then', 'watching', 'two', 'be', 'so', 'disrespectful', 'immature', 'tacky', 'Bruce', 'cocktail', 'dinner', 'night', 'speech', 'blew', 'away', 'Guys', 'run', 'who', 'have', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'hang', 'train', 'stations', 'seem', 'have', 'more', 'class', 'put', 'together', ""'m"", 'hoping', ""'re"", 'doing', 'entertainment', 'instead', 'really', 'being', 'real', 'reality', 'show.As', 'far', 'Kim', 'Bentley', 'thought', 'Kourtney', 'Khloe', 'were', 'ridiculous', 'car', 'shop', 'understood', 'where', 'Kim', 'was', 'coming', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'Kris', 'talk', 'bum', 'street', 'ironically', 'enough', 'found', 'out', 'later', 'season', 'Khloe', 'much', 'nicer', 'homeless', 'people', 'own', 'mother', 'curse', 'out', 'up', 'take', 'stride.I', 'was', 'starting', 'wonder', 'show', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'car', 'crash', 'entire', 'DVD', 'scenes', 'Rob', 'girlfriend', 'were', 'really', 'cute', 'tattoos', 'were', 'top', 'still', 'cute', 'Bruce', 'think', 'Bruce', 'classy', 'entertaining', 'focused', 'bit', 'pushover', 'looked', 'good', 'new', 'wardrobe', 'tight', 'sweater', 'Kim', 'cool', 'too', 'do', ""n't"", 'pay', 'much', 'attention', 'younger', 'girls', 'Do', 'show', 'OK.', 'A', 'little', 'awkward', 'most', 'uncomfortable', 'episode', 'was', 'one', 'New', 'Orleans', 'Something', 'just', 'struck', 'odd', 'girl', 'ask', 'autograph', 'immediately', 'tell', 'Kardashians', 'need', 'see', 'worst', 'parts', 'Louisiana', 'THEN', 'take', 'trailer', 'THEN', 'tell', 'how', 'rough', 'then', 'be', 'surprised', 'when', 'wanted', 'help', 'Let', 'see', 'bunch', 'reality', 'stars', 'camera', 'front', 'came', 'off', 'two', 'opportunists', 'opposed', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'down', 'luck', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Kardashians', 'help', 'could', 'be', 'wrong', 'could', 'all', 'be', 'editing', 'instead', 'feeling', 'inspired', 'helping', 'out', 'homeless', 'guy', 'season', 'was', 'feeding', 'homeless', '[', 'girl', 'who', 'hung', 'out', 'two', 'younger', 'girls', 'seemed', 'genuine', ']', 'one', 'time', 'felt', 'were', 'set', 'up']",N/A
