861973,A3B6JWWBJKDPSS,B000674DO6,"Magickal Merlin ""Wizard""","[1, 2]","Bizarre documentary.Excellent film.It's the only real film about the 'Family'.However,the film starts with the Tate/LoBianca trial and spans over some four years.Half the flock is caged and the remaining brethern are like lost sheep in search of the bell-wether.I was stunned at the raw emotion the documentary conveyed.I felt sorry for Nancy Pitman aka Brenda,whose brother was killed in the Vietnam war.She was a member on the fringe,who then became a devout follower of Manson's harem.Manson is a victim himself too.I think he was simply used by more cunning people,who knew some things about Charlie's life and situation.Charlie was just the fall-guy for Helter Skelter,perhaps a CIA plot to scare hippies off the streets of San Francisco.One thing that many watchers of the trial ,and even Vincent Bugliosi himself perhaps,did not understand was that to what extent the misuse of 'Witchcraft' played in the mind-set of the 'Family'.They just thought they were crazed hippies on drugs.I think they were channeling a lot of negative energy against innocent people,and that's what destroyed their desert paradise.If the Manson Family had continued to survive,it may have wound up as a Jonestown atrocity or a Waco massacre.And if Manson became more sophisticated,he may have turned the desert collective into a depraved gulag concentration camp for hapless drifters.This is a chilling documentary on the real aftermath of the post-60s ,not to be dismissed or easily forgotten.",5,(These Children come at You with Knives...)
