559769,A3QC4SG7NA4ULG,B00004YS4O,A reader,"[3, 4]","Most, if not all, of the songs performed on this DVD are available for viewing free on various video sites, so I wondered: is it really worth it to own the thing?  The answer is yes. The sound quality and visuals are way better on DVD, and it's nice to have the continuity of the recording, since it was taped for German TV without editing. This live, raw performance of the early Cars is more than a historical curiosity. The band demonstrates their technical skill, tight ensemble and sophisticated, quirky material with an intensity and focus that knocked me out. This is hardcore rock 'n roll with a new wave sensibility, and very exciting to listen to.Dressed in red, white and black, The Cars already have some of the fashion sense that would characterize their later shows. But they were never famous for their stage presence, and that lack showed itself right out of the gate.  They don't speak except to introduce the songs, and they drink beer, wander around the stage and fiddle with the amps. The lighting is weird, and the sound is not well-modulated, although it captures the feel of a show in a small club. Never mind about any of that, or about the young, dazed German crowd who clearly don't get it. Focus instead on those catchy songs with great hooks and deep grooves. Notice the brilliant guitar playing of Elliot Easton, whose eclectic mix of 1960's references keeps the band solidly in the rock vein; the Energizer-Bunny dynamism of drummer David Robinson, who barely breaks a sweat; and Greg Hawkes' multi-tasking of synth/guitar/saxophone/vocals and assorted analog sound effects. Then there are the signature vocals of composer/frontman Ric Ocasek and especially bassist Benjamin Orr, a really fine singer. There's great chemistry between Easton and Orr, who sidle up to each other on the instrumental breaks, stare into each other's eyes and make a whole lot of guitar love.The 2000 interview that follows was The Cars' last as a group, since Orr died shortly thereafter. I cannot imagine the emotions they had to grapple with, knowing their task was to reminisce about the good old days while Ben was wasting away from cancer and barely able to talk. But they pull it off with candor, humor and grace. It's rare to see someone that ill in front of the camera, and it's a credit to Orr's strength and humility that he allowed himself to be filmed. The comparison with the beautiful, sexual man in the concert footage makes his condition in the interview all the more painful to see. The Cars reveal themselves to be articulate, serious musicians with serious love for one another. Ocasek notes that he and Orr were teenagers when they formed their musical partnership (they're both in their 50's here). There's a brief moment where he smiles at Orr and touches his shoulder that says more about the bond between them than words ever could.Sometimes I think the purpose of celebrity is to provide the rest of us with role models of how to, and how not to, behave. This interview was a demonstration in being present for our loved ones, even as they're about to leave us forever.Once I was done crying, I was very glad I purchased this musical reminder of how great The Cars were, along with a poignant glimpse into who they came to be.",5,Wow,1258416000,"11 17, 2009",2009,3260,"['Most', 'not', 'songs', 'performed', 'DVD', 'are', 'available', 'viewing', 'free', 'various', 'video', 'sites', 'wondered', 'really', 'own', 'thing', 'answer', 'yes', 'sound', 'quality', 'visuals', 'are', 'way', 'better', 'DVD', 'nice', 'have', 'continuity', 'recording', 'was', 'taped', 'German', 'TV', 'editing', 'live', 'raw', 'performance', 'early', 'Cars', 'more', 'historical', 'curiosity', 'band', 'technical', 'skill', 'tight', 'ensemble', 'sophisticated', 'quirky', 'material', 'intensity', 'focus', 'knocked', 'out', 'hardcore', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'new', 'wave', 'sensibility', 'very', 'exciting', 'listen', 'to.Dressed', 'red', 'white', 'black', 'Cars', 'already', 'have', 'fashion', 'sense', 'would', 'characterize', 'later', 'shows', 'were', 'never', 'famous', 'stage', 'presence', 'lack', 'showed', 'right', 'gate', 'do', ""n't"", 'speak', 'introduce', 'songs', 'drink', 'beer', 'wander', 'stage', 'fiddle', 'amps', 'lighting', 'weird', 'sound', 'not', 'well-modulated', 'feel', 'show', 'small', 'club', 'Never', 'mind', 'young', 'dazed', 'German', 'crowd', 'who', 'clearly', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'Focus', 'instead', 'catchy', 'songs', 'great', 'hooks', 'deep', 'grooves', 'Notice', 'brilliant', 'guitar', 'playing', 'Elliot', 'Easton', 'eclectic', 'mix', '1960', 'references', 'band', 'solidly', 'rock', 'vein', 'Energizer-Bunny', 'dynamism', 'drummer', 'David', 'Robinson', 'who', 'barely', 'sweat', 'Greg', 'Hawkes', 'multi-tasking', 'synth/guitar/saxophone/vocals', 'assorted', 'analog', 'sound', 'effects', 'Then', 'are', 'signature', 'vocals', 'composer/frontman', 'Ric', 'Ocasek', 'especially', 'bassist', 'Benjamin', 'Orr', 'really', 'fine', 'singer', 'great', 'chemistry', 'Easton', 'Orr', 'who', 'sidle', 'up', 'other', 'instrumental', 'breaks', 'stare', 'other', 'eyes', 'make', 'whole', 'lot', 'guitar', 'love.The', '2000', 'interview', 'was', 'Cars', 'last', 'group', 'Orr', 'died', 'shortly', 'thereafter', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'emotions', 'had', 'grapple', 'knowing', 'task', 'was', 'reminisce', 'good', 'old', 'days', 'Ben', 'was', 'wasting', 'away', 'cancer', 'barely', 'able', 'talk', 'pull', 'off', 'candor', 'humor', 'grace', 'rare', 'see', 'someone', 'ill', 'front', 'camera', 'credit', 'Orr', 'strength', 'humility', 'allowed', 'be', 'filmed', 'comparison', 'beautiful', 'sexual', 'man', 'concert', 'footage', 'condition', 'interview', 'more', 'painful', 'see', 'Cars', 'reveal', 'be', 'articulate', 'serious', 'musicians', 'serious', 'love', 'one', 'Ocasek', 'Orr', 'were', 'teenagers', 'when', 'formed', 'musical', 'partnership', ""'re"", '50', 'here', 'brief', 'moment', 'where', 'Orr', 'touches', 'shoulder', 'more', 'bond', 'words', 'ever', 'could.Sometimes', 'think', 'purpose', 'celebrity', 'provide', 'rest', 'role', 'models', 'how', 'how', 'not', 'behave', 'interview', 'was', 'demonstration', 'being', 'present', 'loved', 'ones', 'even', ""'re"", 'leave', 'forever.Once', 'was', 'done', 'crying', 'was', 'very', 'glad', 'purchased', 'musical', 'reminder', 'how', 'great', 'Cars', 'were', 'poignant', 'glimpse', 'who', 'came', 'be']",N/A

559774,AY12DBB0U420B,B00004YS4O,Gary Peterson,"[1, 1]","In 1978, I discovered ""New Wave"" music starting with Devo and Talking Heads. I loved it. Not too much later I discovered The Cars, first through their debut LP, The Cars, and then the Candy-O followup LP. What nicely arranged and produced music! I almost wore those records out! Memories of the Cars gradually receded as I began to listen to more and more newly-minted New Wave bands. Then recently, I came across ""The Cars Live"" DVD, a recording of a concert originally produced as a TV show in 1979. I had to have it.I have very mixed feelings about this DVD. The sound quality is simply awful. The video portion is only so-so. The Cars performance comes across as routine and somewhat tired rather than inspired. The crowd is polite, but shows no great enthusiasm. Yet, it's great to see this band perform live so close to their beginnings.If you sit through this DVD, be sure to go to the Special Section where all five of the Cars are sitting around and discussing their early careers, It's very interesting, actually more interesting than the TV performance. Ben Orr looks near death, and I guess that actually was the case. It was great fun to view the band members in their fully adult state and discussing their early careers as a band.So, my suggestions might be, if you're just interested in Cars music, then go with their first two record albums now available on CDs. It doesn't get any better. If you're a Cars fan and would like to see them as they really were on stage in the 70s in the very early part of their careers, this can be a fun DVD to view for that reason only, if you can get around the wretched production. If you would like to see what the Cars are like as people, the special section is excellent.

559784,APN6DO7VHDLTN,B00004YS4O,Missing Person,"[51, 54]","Although certain Cars fans favor the ""Heartbeat City"" era, I suspect that a high percentage of Cars lovers lean toward their first couple albums, from 1978 and '79 respectively, as their favorites.  The concert performance contained herein was recorded for the German pop music series Musikladen in late 1978, and although The Cars received notoriously unflattering reviews from the British press on this European tour, every track is performed with a lot of energy and conviction anyway--it barely feels at all like they're merely going through the motions.  The only time that technological primitiveness seems to be a problem is with the pompous, overloud syndrums at the beginning of ""Good Times Roll""--the syndrums were kept in check on the studio version--and if this was the best they could do in a live setting, they should have just been smart & ditched them altogether instead of feeling the need to recreate the studio version so exactingly.  As for the camera work, it's very tastefully done--Elliot Easton was a great lead guitarist and thankfully both he and synth player Greg Hawkes are given solid coverage so you can actually watch what they do.  Hawkes' performance with various devices on ""I'm In Touch With Your World"" is impressive and highly amusing, plus it's interesting to see him switch to guitar making for a 3 guitar attack on ""Take What You Want"".  Hawkes usually looks incredibly stiff and hopelessly nerdy on stage, but what the hell, it's pretty amusing--it's probably just what came naturally to him.  Ben Orr had a total command on playing bass guitar, and he's in great voice here, plus he kind of serves as the ""front man"".  Ric Ocasek's stage presence is ultra-collected--he never smiles or speaks to the audience (it's no surprise to learn that Ric hated touring)--and when matched with his confident performance, not to mention his sunglasses, it provides a certain mysteriousness which is quite fitting for a guy like Ocasek.  The background vocals leave a little to be desired, but still, it's not a huge gripe.  Don't come to this DVD expecting ""Jurassic Park""-style sound & visuals--the sound quality, although mono, is real good sounding mono, and the picture quality is very good as well.  Plus, there are no weak tracks in the entire concert.  Although others have complained about the audio & picture quality, I must say I feel the lack of gloss and relative 'lo-fi'-ness to be a refreshing change of pace.  If you prefer gloss and polish, then go listen to the Cars' studio albums.In addition to the concert, you get a 40+ minute interview segment with all 5 Cars members together, and it's a major addition.  Although there is a slight sense of awkwardness from time to time, Easton, Ocasek, and David Robinson are all in great spirit and display cool personalities that are impossible to dislike.  Easton had long hoped for a Cars reunion and he's clearly delighted to be with his old band-mates again.  And Ocasek once again comes across as mysterious yet with a solid dose of whimsy--he has a way of being amusingly evasive.  Hawkes, true to form, is pretty quiet, as is Orr.  It's obvious that they all knew Ben Orr was nearing the end, and indeed, he died just a few months or so after the interview took place--this probably had a lot to do with the idea of bringing the full band together one last time, but either way, I think it's really great that they did so before it was too late.If you're a bonafide Cars fanatic, I can't imagine you'd think this is anything less than a supremely enjoyable DVD.  Even medium-level fans ought to find it worthwhile.",5,a splendidly entertaining document of this seminal 'New Wave' band,1108598400,"02 17, 2005",2005,3611,"['certain', 'Cars', 'fans', 'favor', 'Heartbeat', 'City', 'era', 'suspect', 'high', 'percentage', 'Cars', 'lovers', 'lean', 'first', 'couple', 'albums', '1978', ""'79"", 'respectively', 'favorites', 'concert', 'performance', 'contained', 'herein', 'was', 'recorded', 'German', 'pop', 'music', 'series', 'Musikladen', 'late', '1978', 'Cars', 'received', 'notoriously', 'unflattering', 'reviews', 'British', 'press', 'European', 'tour', 'track', 'performed', 'lot', 'energy', 'conviction', 'anyway', 'barely', ""'re"", 'merely', 'going', 'motions', 'only', 'time', 'technological', 'primitiveness', 'be', 'problem', 'pompous', 'overloud', 'syndrums', 'beginning', 'Good', 'Times', 'Roll', 'syndrums', 'were', 'kept', 'check', 'studio', 'version', 'was', 'best', 'could', 'do', 'live', 'setting', 'should', 'have', 'just', 'been', 'smart', 'ditched', 'altogether', 'instead', 'feeling', 'need', 'recreate', 'studio', 'version', 'so', 'exactingly', 'camera', 'work', 'very', 'tastefully', 'done', 'Elliot', 'Easton', 'was', 'great', 'lead', 'guitarist', 'thankfully', 'synth', 'player', 'Greg', 'Hawkes', 'are', 'given', 'solid', 'coverage', 'can', 'actually', 'watch', 'what', 'do', 'Hawkes', 'performance', 'various', 'devices', ""'m"", 'Touch', 'Your', 'World', 'impressive', 'highly', 'amusing', 'interesting', 'see', 'switch', 'guitar', 'making', '3', 'guitar', 'attack', 'Take', 'What', 'Want', 'Hawkes', 'usually', 'incredibly', 'stiff', 'hopelessly', 'nerdy', 'stage', 'what', 'hell', 'pretty', 'amusing', 'probably', 'just', 'what', 'came', 'naturally', 'Ben', 'Orr', 'had', 'total', 'command', 'playing', 'bass', 'guitar', 'great', 'voice', 'here', 'kind', 'serves', 'front', 'man', 'Ric', 'Ocasek', 'stage', 'presence', 'ultra-collected', 'never', 'audience', 'surprise', 'learn', 'Ric', 'hated', 'touring', 'when', 'matched', 'confident', 'performance', 'not', 'mention', 'sunglasses', 'certain', 'mysteriousness', 'quite', 'fitting', 'guy', 'Ocasek', 'background', 'vocals', 'leave', 'little', 'be', 'desired', 'still', 'not', 'huge', 'gripe', 'Do', ""n't"", 'come', 'DVD', 'expecting', 'Jurassic', 'Park', '-style', 'sound', 'visuals', 'sound', 'quality', 'mono', 'real', 'good', 'sounding', 'mono', 'picture', 'quality', 'very', 'good', 'well', 'are', 'weak', 'tracks', 'entire', 'concert', 'others', 'have', 'complained', 'audio', 'picture', 'quality', 'must', 'say', 'feel', 'lack', 'gloss', 'relative', ""'lo-fi'-ness"", 'be', 'refreshing', 'change', 'pace', 'prefer', 'gloss', 'polish', 'then', 'go', 'listen', 'Cars', 'studio', 'albums.In', 'addition', 'concert', 'get', '40+', 'minute', 'interview', 'segment', '5', 'Cars', 'members', 'together', 'major', 'addition', 'slight', 'sense', 'awkwardness', 'time', 'time', 'Easton', 'Ocasek', 'David', 'Robinson', 'are', 'great', 'spirit', 'display', 'cool', 'personalities', 'are', 'impossible', 'dislike', 'Easton', 'had', 'long', 'hoped', 'Cars', 'reunion', 'clearly', 'delighted', 'be', 'old', 'band-mates', 'again', 'Ocasek', 'once', 'again', 'mysterious', 'yet', 'solid', 'dose', 'whimsy', 'way', 'being', 'amusingly', 'evasive', 'Hawkes', 'true', 'form', 'pretty', 'quiet', 'Orr', 'obvious', 'knew', 'Ben', 'Orr', 'was', 'nearing', 'end', 'indeed', 'died', 'just', 'few', 'months', 'so', 'interview', 'took', 'place', 'probably', 'had', 'lot', 'do', 'idea', 'bringing', 'full', 'band', 'together', 'one', 'last', 'time', 'way', 'think', 'really', 'great', 'did', 'so', 'was', 'too', 'late.If', ""'re"", 'bonafide', 'Cars', 'fanatic', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', ""'d"", 'think', 'anything', 'less', 'supremely', 'enjoyable', 'DVD', 'Even', 'medium-level', 'fans', 'ought', 'find', 'worthwhile']",N/A

What is particularly interesting is that the songs sound the way they do on the albums, and Rhino left in the spaces between the songs so you can see the knob turning and effects-box stepping, just like you were at the show.

The Cars play a strong set of songs, including a song, ""Take What You Want,"" which was never released on vinyl or CD. I must state that ""Take What You Want"" was a pretty cool song.Certainly, The Cars, as a whole, don't have much flair during during their performance. There's virtually zero interaction between them and the audience. In between songs is quiet as they prepare for the next one. However, I must admit that the audience, itself, was rather subdued. With that said, I really had fun. This DVD brought back memories.The sound was quite decent. There were some minor issues, a combination of performance and post production - very minor.

Uncanny? I don't know. It's just that each member had a presence that was somehow so extremely different from the other, that each managed to work out their own, individual brand of appeal. I love the way Ric Ocasek wanders around indifferently (and dig those praying mantis sunglasses!), the way David Robinson plays the drums with a goofy-yet-precise rock n' roll manner, the way Greg Hawkes diplays his endearing, not-of-this-earth new wave preening (often directly at the camera), the way Elliot Easton tosses off his Kinks-like riffing (complete with eye squints, gaping mouth, and glossy stare), and the way Ben Orr (the greatest voice of the era and my sentimental favorite) exudes the ideal sensibility, a combination of arrogant swagger and artsy sensitivity. The Cars have unfortunately faded in reputation, yet this dvd monumentalizes all that was great about them, a group of great musicians who all brought something unique to the band, giving it a one-of-a-kind chemistry. As a humourous plus, the Musikladen audience seems every bit as ""out there"" and indifferent as Ocasek! Sure, the interview that is included on the disc is tinged with melancholy (especially when Ocasek pats the visibly ailing Orr on the shoulder...), yet it's an invaluable document.

559789,A3A81ZZ4ANLZ8G,B00004YS4O,"The Critic ""Movie Maniac""","[3, 5]","The ""Cars"" live at Musikladen 1979 concert DVD is one of the best and worst in my DVD concert collection. I realize that this show is from the late 70's and technology back then isn't what it is today but come on. This is another low budget attempt by Rhino to release a great band on DVD with poor picture and sound quality. The picture is average to good at best and there are lots of blemishes and artifacts in the video transfer. The 5.1 audio as stated on the DVD ranges from poor to average at best and given the fact its ""The Cars"" I was absolutely disappointed with the DVD quality for the money I spent.While ""Cars"" concert performances are extremely rare, I believe a better effort could have been made by Rhino records on this one. Other companies like Eagle Rock Entertainment put out concerts from the 70's with better picture and sound than Rhino. This concert DVD is over priced in my opinion considering the lack of audio/video quality from Rhino. Cars fans, Make no mistake; the show itself is top notch and the band is in great form. Overall there just wasn't enough to satisfy me with this purchase. It's a five star performance from a five star band on a two star DVD.
