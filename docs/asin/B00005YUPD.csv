Jack is also trying to avoid three goons who want to break his legs after he is caught in a compromising position with a married women (Mary Steenburgen). Selma Blair plays a hooker who goes along with them and Jack soon falls for her. Also good is the barely recognisable John C. McGinley as a dreadlocked, pothead hippie (New Zealanders, does this remind you of a certain MP?).HIGHWAY features music by Rich Robinson from The Black Crowes. There's an amusing scene where Jack chainsaws the top off Pilot's car while he is asleep to make it into a convertible.

691050,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B00005YUPD,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[6, 16]","I am going to use the word 'hip' a number of times in this review, so I decided to look it up and see what the defintion was in the context of how I will be using it.  The internet dictionary says the following -1.  Keenly aware of or knowledgeable about the latest trends or developments.2.  Very fashionable or stylish.This movie had it's moments, but they were far and few between.  Jared Leto plays Jack Hayes, a guy on the run because he was having an affair with another man's wife.  And the man just happened to be connected to the mob of sorts, so he sends three goons after Jack to mess him up.  Kind of hard to feel any sympathy for this guy, as he pretty much gets what he deserves.  Next we have Pilot, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, a stoner who agrees to travel with Jack from Las Vegas to Seattle, intially as support, but later it's discovered he has his own motives.  He's a pusher who smokes a lot of pot, so again, another character undeserving of anyone's sympathies.  Finally, we meet Cassie, played by Selma Blair.  After the boys make a quick stop at a brothel, the hook up with Cassie.  Cassie is a prostitute who sort of fell into the business and stayed in because the money was good.  Another wonderful character.  There were some funny moments, with scenes involving Jeremy Piven and John C. McGinley, but overall this movie fell kinda flat for me.  I enjoy the road trip type movie, Fandango being one of my favorites, but, with that movie, I developed an interest in the characters, and wanted to see what happened next.  It's like you wanted to put yourself in the group, go with them, have the experiences they're having, but there was none of that in this movie.  I felt little to nothing for the characters, as they were a bunch of self serving a&&holes.;  At the end of the movie, when one character got caught and punished, I couldn't have cared less.  Actions have consequences, and negative actions usually have negative consequences.  I know this wasn't supposed to be a full on comedy, as I think it was supposed to be a reflection of the gen-x culture, much like Easy Rider was a relflection of the 60's counterculture, but it didn't come off that way. The exagerrated attempt to be quirky and hip really showed and fell flat, like a can of soda pop left open for too long.  ""But"", you ask, ""how can a movie with characters with such hip and cool names like Pilot, Johnny the Fox, Scawldy, Boneman, Moon, Shanks, and Softboy not be cool?"" Well, there you go.  Mildly amusing at times, but trying too hard the rest of the time.  You can't make a concious effort to be hip.  Either you are or you aren't.  And the harder you try, the less you are.  You want to see a good road trip movie?

I, however, am on the other side. There are any number of road flicks out there and I've seen my share, but this was one of the better ones in my book.What makes this work for me are the characters. Yes. The John McGinley character is over the top and the Jeremy Piven character is WAYYYYYY over the top but they have really good scenes. The kind of scenes you rarely get in movies.The story is pretty basic. Jared and Jake are buds since forever. Jared gets caught with his woowoo in a bad guy's wife's honey pot and the 2 are on the run to Seattle so Jared doesn't get his feet busted.These are interesting people. They all have their stories and there is a whole homosexual underpinning between the two. They aren't necessarily good people and you probably won't want to sit and have a beer with them but you do find yourself liking them in spite of their trashiness. Maybe it's because they really aren't bad people and not particularly given to violence. They're just lost.The performances and the writing bring this to a the upper, upper levels of viewing enjoyment. Everyone does a fine job. The directing, production design, music etc., etc., etc. are all pro level. The pace is so even you can practically set your watch to it. And it doesn't run on too long. It knows when to end. And like too many Hollywood movies this does not have a happy ending. Jake's fantasy explodes and the cavalry doesn't show up in the nick of time.

Jake Gyllenhaal proved once again that his selection of diverse movie roles sets him apart from all other of the new actors, this role of Pilot not being an exception to the rule.  Jake, like Brando, Nicholson and Penn, has again made a wise choice displaying his intensity and moodiness that is so appealing in diversification.  He has not even gotten close to showing his full potential, but I imagine it will blossom further and to the delight of hard core performance seekers like me.  I recommend this movie on many levels.

What comes out of their mouths is a whole lot of nonsense and you end up watching these characters go from point A to point D and have no idea why or what they're doing. Towards the beginning of the movie, Leto and Gyllenhaal visit this lunatic before heading out on their road trip. This guy goes on a rant about God only knows what for what seems like 15min and you can tell by the look on Leto and Gyllenhaal's faces that they wish they were in any movie besides this one. All of the characters in this movie are obnoxious and you care nothing about any of them. But what I found to be the most ridiculous is how these character kept bumping into each other. The movie starts out in Nevada and ends in Washington. Somehow, they all just happen to have run-ins. And what was the point of Alligator Boy? Seriously?This movie should have been 10min long.

It's about some people doing some stuff that happens to be funny. And while that may sound stupid it makes for an entertaining movie because well, state of mind!! Think what the characters might be thinking to do what they do and say.""Desmond the Alligator Boy is a major happener"", who the heck can say something like that? Well, Pilot!I'm anti drugs so this movie assures me that using drugs is senseless and I don't need to have that in my life in order to be happy. But Pilot (Jake Gyllenhaal) is high a lot so what he does/thinks/says is influenced by 'the influence'. *wink*More importantly, movies like this make me miss my friends if they're not around.

691066,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00005YUPD,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[17, 21]","Highway (James Cox, 2002)There are any number of reasons to watch James Cox's first feature film, Highway (not least of which because Cox directed one of 2003's most talked-about and controversial films, Wonderland). It's hard to say the film itself is one of them, oddly enough.It centers around two stoned-out buddies, Pilot (the always wonderful Jake Gyllenhaal) and Jack (Jared Leto, looking for all the world like Charlie Sheen in Repo Man here). Jack, the womanizer, has found himself in bed with the wrong woman, the trophy wife of a mob boss, and needs to get out of Las Vegas. He and Pilot head for Seattle after one of the most surreal drug buys in all of film (the dealer played by Jeremy Piven, recently seen in Black Hawk Down and Very Bad Things, deserves a film all to himself). Along the way, they find themselves repeatedly entangled with a homeless runaway (Selma Blair) and an old hippie trying to get to Seattle for the Kurt Cobain vigil (John C. McGinley). The stage is set, and the movie makes its Easy Rider-esque way through the West.The main reason to see this movie is that Jake Gyllenhaal and Jared Leto are fantastic actors. Blair (soon to be in the much-hyped Hellboy) and McGinley make great foils for the two. I'd be hard-pressed to call this a comedy, but it does have its share of uncomfortably funny lines. It ends up, however, being (as odd as this sounds) a lighthearted tale about the myriad ways in which one's dreams can be shattered.Did I like it? I still haven't figured that out.
