I watched the first hour of the movie and I felt boredom. Then, almost at the end I got my desired action. Another disappointment is lack of aliens from other movies. I don't know whether it was good or bad. We saw the new species, but as the prequel to alien I expected to see at least one facehugger. I don't really see much connection between Xenomorphs and those aliens. Then, at the end I wanted to see the scientist travel to another planet. Those who watched the movie, know why she would travel on that planet, but still they could just give another 30 minutes to show exactly what would happen. Ending didn't satisfy me. There will be no second part to the movie, so I felt disappointed. Still, it isn't a waste of time, just a little boring movie. And last but not least, I knew there would a famous actress playing in Prometheus. I expected Angelina Jolie. But Charlize Theron was chosen and she was great! I really thought that this decision would suck. I was wrong. She was by far my favorite actress in the movie. Others played good, but I had no feelings to them.Update:I watched an extended edition (fan made) with the run time of 02:21:32. While the very beginning is boring, it was quite important to the plot itself. The theatrical edition features no xenomorphs, but in the extended edition there is a creature that is either a xenomorph or a pre-xenomorph. That moment was the only great moment in the whole movie. Only after seeing it, am I so much looking forward for the 'Prometheus Paradise' movie.While given extended cuts, we still weren't given everything and instead of adding the complete extended version together with theatrical version a fan of the movie had to manually put all parts together to make an extended edition himself. Unless you see the extended edition of the movie, you haven't really seen 'Prometheus'. We all know how much potential the movie's got, but extended edition is simply the best. I really want to see more special features and more deleted scenes put back in the official extended version. Also I hope the cast for the 'Prometheus Paradise' movie is going to be different. I didn't like actors in this movie. Please get rid of the main surviving actress, like kill her in the early beginning of the second movie or just do anything.",4,Extended edition,1339977600,"06 18, 2012",2012,2375,"['Theatrical', 'edition', 'Prometheus', 'got', 'story', 'visual', 'effects', 'action', 'watched', 'first', 'hour', 'movie', 'felt', 'boredom', 'Then', 'almost', 'end', 'got', 'desired', 'action', 'disappointment', 'lack', 'aliens', 'other', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'good', 'bad', 'saw', 'new', 'species', 'prequel', 'alien', 'expected', 'see', 'least', 'one', 'facehugger', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'much', 'connection', 'Xenomorphs', 'aliens', 'Then', 'end', 'wanted', 'see', 'scientist', 'travel', 'planet', 'who', 'watched', 'movie', 'know', 'why', 'would', 'travel', 'planet', 'still', 'could', 'just', 'give', '30', 'minutes', 'show', 'exactly', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'Ending', 'did', ""n't"", 'satisfy', 'will', 'be', 'second', 'part', 'movie', 'felt', 'disappointed', 'Still', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'just', 'little', 'boring', 'movie', 'last', 'not', 'least', 'knew', 'would', 'famous', 'actress', 'playing', 'Prometheus', 'expected', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'was', 'chosen', 'was', 'great', 'really', 'thought', 'decision', 'would', 'suck', 'was', 'wrong', 'was', 'far', 'favorite', 'actress', 'movie', 'Others', 'played', 'good', 'had', 'feelings', 'them.Update', 'watched', 'extended', 'edition', 'fan', 'made', 'run', 'time', '02:21:32', 'very', 'beginning', 'boring', 'was', 'quite', 'important', 'plot', 'theatrical', 'edition', 'xenomorphs', 'extended', 'edition', 'creature', 'xenomorph', 'pre-xenomorph', 'moment', 'was', 'only', 'great', 'moment', 'whole', 'movie', 'Only', 'seeing', 'am', 'so', 'much', 'looking', 'forward', ""'Prometheus"", 'Paradise', 'movie.While', 'given', 'extended', 'cuts', 'still', 'were', ""n't"", 'given', 'everything', 'instead', 'adding', 'complete', 'extended', 'version', 'together', 'theatrical', 'version', 'fan', 'movie', 'had', 'manually', 'put', 'parts', 'together', 'make', 'extended', 'edition', 'see', 'extended', 'edition', 'movie', 'have', ""n't"", 'really', 'seen', ""'Prometheus"", 'know', 'how', 'much', 'movie', 'got', 'extended', 'edition', 'simply', 'best', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'more', 'special', 'features', 'more', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'put', 'back', 'official', 'extended', 'version', 'Also', 'hope', 'cast', ""'Prometheus"", 'Paradise', 'movie', 'going', 'be', 'different', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'actors', 'movie', 'Please', 'get', 'rid', 'main', 'surviving', 'actress', 'kill', 'early', 'beginning', 'second', 'movie', 'just', 'do', 'anything']",N/A

I actually had to call and talk to a live person at Fox, so hopefully this will help.  If you want to download to iTunes, the steps remind me of a computer equivalent to the multiple doors at the Get Smart headquarters from the old TV show.  First, insert the digital copy disc into your disc drive on your computer.  Second, go to your Computer program and select the DVD and right click and Open. Third, double click on DVDROM.  Fourth, double click to opent Media Manager.  Fifth, at the bottom of the list is MediaManagerII.exe.  Sixth, double click on that and it will open a box for fox digital copy.  There you will have three more steps to follow!  Sixth, enter the code from the DVD insert and then at step 2 pick iTunes for the platform.  Step 3 will give you the actual code you need to enter in iTunes, so copy and paste it into the redemption code box in the iTunes store.  Then, click your heels three times and say ""There's no place like iTunes"" three times.  By then, it should start downloading.I feel like I just completed a successful brain surgery on someone after getting this accomplished.  I'm going to copy and past this review, because the same thing is needed for Abraham Lincoln Vampire Slayer.

They explained everything.""  There's an old maxim in creative writing.  Never TELL your audience - SHOW them.  That maxim has been both ignored and abused in the case of Prometheus. The filmmakers show you too much and explain just about everything too.  Director Ridley Scott's return to the Alien universe is mostly non-triumphant.  On revisiting a flame he he first ignited in 1979, one done with a great minimalist and atmospheric effect, Scott has betrayed his success by employing a genuinely odd and disjointed script, perfunctory direction and an endless hall of monster's closet scares.  Ridley is much better than this.  In fact, I'm hard pressed to find if he's ever been worse.  If you don't want to read the rest of the review, I'll cut to the chase right here.  You ever see the recent prequel of The Thing?  It was good, not great, but good.  Well Prometheus is pretty much the exact same movie, but much much stupider and no where near as absorbing.Prometheus is a concept film, wrapped in leftover sets and costumes from Avatar and spiced with Creature from the Black Lagoon.  Despite how hard the movie  tells the audience what we are watching is an Alien ""prequel,"" (or by the end he's trying to tell us its a prequel to a prequel), I'm hard pressed to find any substantive in execution to connect Pormetheus Alien, Aliens or even the jumbled Alien3.  Those films were at best, riveting.  At worst, in the case of Alien 3, boring.  I will stop there with comparisons because all that followed Fincher's mess really don't bother mention and I believe this one could fall into that category.  Aliens vs Predator may even have a better script..I know right?Exposition is at a premium here but development is scarce.  From the first scenes, mystery is left to the dogs and before we can immerse ourselves in the unknown, voluble lectures of the plot yet to unfold are given ad nauseum. Prometheus is essentially two films.  One is a concept of human origin, the other, and the majority in general, is an endless series of monster's closets.  Just when things settle down and it feels as if we could be watching an actual science fiction movie, the jumpy music cues, gooey scares and terrible dialog set in.  Then there's the other half.  A nebulous origin story - one that could be interesting - is buried under rubber chicken on the string gags.  Oh but there are mysteries.  Why do they keep taking the helmets off?  Why bother having them at all?  Why did nobody ask Liz about her quickie operation and that nasty ""leftover?""  That's just the short end of it.  How can we trace our DNA to these tall aryans?  Then what the heck were the Neatherthals and all the other humans we share nearly identical DNA with? The script displays the trademark ravenous touch for dead ends of writer Damon Lindeloff, one of the head writers of TV's LOST.  He should stick to television or perhaps working the McDonalds drive up, or would he screw that up too?  Deus ex machina is at a premium, character exchanges are laughable, scenes pace with the tempo of a video game commercial and I still can't count how many endings the movie had.  That last ""reveal""  was certainly a laugh, because a lot of the people in the theater found it funny.But it's not all bad.  Noomi Rapace is a decent match for Sigourney Weaver and proves yet again, even in the face of a terrible script, she will pull off anything handed to her.  Just like in the superior Swedish Dragon Tattoo film, her unwavering commitment to her character shores up a meager story and holds us to the end.  Michael Fassbender too gives a noteworthy play as the android and gives Lance Henrickson's turn in the same boots a run for his money.  I don't know what Charlize Theron and Guy Pierce were doing here but she and everybody else are simply cashing a paycheck.Where did humans come from?  I don't know but the mystery of who bankrolled a script this bad is a conundrum worth solving.  It is pretty obvious why Ripley never wanted people to know where the Aliens came from.  She saw Prometheus and knew it sucked.  Ripley warned us and tried to save us, but we had to ask.

Or this is the latest Alien in the fashion of the last Indy Jones movie, it's that garish! Or a pretentious bookstore that only sells porno mags. The mystery of the film is a real presence but once you get to the actual details it just falls apart. I'd like to say this is NOT a Hollywood movie, this is a British cast and production shot on location nowhere near America. Hollywood at least doesn't put on the airs that these jokers to do being sophisticated. The secret of our makers is that they will rip our heads off?

Ugly British actors don't help either. The Brits would be the last ones to get so far in space, the modern ones mind you not the empire ones.I'm not going to go into all the details but suffice it to say one major example is the UGLY main female actress directs her own c-section by a robotic surgery machine, which patches her up with metal staples (like out of an actual stapler) then gets up immediately afterwards and runs away. Come on, really?  Also they have the obligatory android with his head ripped off, again really? Recycling is great, just not in a movie. And these ""scientists"" are about as competent as teenage girls at the prom.

This film provides a multitude of thrills and chills, and -- yes -- the Aliens are there.  But it's a more philosophical film that asks questions about man's origins and our inability to find the ultimate creative spark for our existence.  The film is constantly dark befitting its mood of imminent danger.  The crew that lands on the distant planet looking for architectural evidence of the beings that created us seems constantly on the verge of destruction, and, in fact, most of them die.  Director Ridley Scott (Alien, Blade Runner) is at the top of his game, even when the script doesn't match up to his directorial and special effects powers.  And while you expect plenty of death and mayhem in this film, it's still horrifying.  If you need that catharsis in your life, you'll find the film provides it -- and without the need for cartoonish characters from slasher films.I was particularly impressed with the scenes when the pre-cursor human being projected our galaxy around him and demonstrated his complete control of it.  In 3-D, this projection was quite magical and worth the price of admission.  But can a woman go through abdominal surgery (done by a robotic surgical system with no human being present other than the patient), then struggle to get off the operating cable, and have the energy and will power to save the galaxy?  Kind of doubtful, but plenty exciting as well.  The best 3D came in the projection of the solar system, much of the rest of it was depth and ambience.

Unfortunately, I felt it went on about 30-40 minutes too long, and I didn't find any of the characters in the movie interesting.  In that way, it reminded me of the 'Star Wars' Episodes I-III movies, which also lacked anyone that I cared for; in all of these movies, I was hoping that all of these characters would be killed off in the first 15 minutes, so the real stars of the movie would enter.  Never happened.  We were stuck with the same dolts throughout the picture.Also, am I the only one who felt that the characters in 'Prometheus' were almost exactly like the characters in 'Alien vs. Predator', another uninteresting and overcrowded group that you didn't mind seeing killed off one-by-one?Overall, I wouldn't call the money I spent on this movie a waste, but this won't find an honored spot in my movie collection, either.

My expectations were obviously very high for this movie and for me it exceeded those expectations.First those expecting an ""Alien"" movie were forewarned by Ridley himself that this was not going there and that the story was focused on telling that of the space jockey and his race. THAT is what I expected and that is what we got.The elements of ""Alien"" that give a nod to the xenomorph was just fine for me in explaining where they evolved from, and what they were ""engineered"" for which has been obvious and foretold in prior Alien movies which was to be used as a weapon. Starting out as a killer bacteria and just like any bacteria they eventually grew from their first incarnation. But honestly who cares about that? This movie explores a much deeper element of that universe which I feel is way more thought provoking. Where do we come from? Who are the creators?I do not want to give away to much because I want to keep this spoiler free. All I can say is I LOVE where Ridley Scott took this movie and I hope that HE follows through with two more sequels to continue THIS story line.

Those who have seen the movie and get it will understand what I am talking about.

I usually am indifferent to most movies and can jump in and out of a movie without regretting having stepped away for a few moments.

1474960,AYYXP75GUA6RP,B005LAIHXQ,Amazon Customer,"[2, 4]","My first thought was to generously give this movie three stars, on the basis that: while it is similar (but inferior) to Alien, it is much more ambitious. The defense of the poor execution and conception would be in the degree of difficulty (in telling a survival-horror story against a SF-creation-myth backdrop). But that defense doesn't wash, because the SF story is a fake-out: we ultimately understand as little about the universe of Prometheus as we do about the Alien. Since there actually is no explanation here, there can be no justification for ending up with a story as loose and floppy as this one. Perhaps Ridley Scott wants to make a more cerebral type of movie now; if this is the outcome, then I think that decision is a pity. Alien feels tense, urgent, and mysterious & has a definite point of view. I didn't love it, but it's an excellent movie. Prometheus resolves to the same type of hidden danger creature feature, but without those qualities and with: empty pretension, meaningless character detail, and (unintentional?) comedy where a ""climax"" involves outrunning a spaceship. I watched it through to the end partly to find the (non-existent) answers, but mostly because Michael Fassbender and Charlize Theron play their characters as though they might develop into something interesting (they do not). But where I was watching, everyone else gave up halfway through (and I can't blame them).It seems to be an ambitious failure, but I have to ask why such an ambitious failure is necessary. Apparently, Ridley Scott was always surprised that fans weren't keen to know the origin of the original alien humanoids.

Not much happens in the exact story, but the overall legend that this story adds to the Alien universe is essential!

1474974,AQUVTQFFXP4AC,B005LAIHXQ,"Andariel Halo ""Disillusioned Smark""","[15, 40]","I think the movie's near-hysterical marketing campaign did it in more than any number of flaws and acting problems in the movie itself.  Being billed as somehow the next generation of movie-making, an epic so incredible and so beyond the medium of cinema itself, with a plot supposedly so spellbinding and powerful that it has to be kept secret until the screenings.And I can safely say there was almost nothing original, colossal, or paradigm-shifting in this entire movie.The plot is basically the next step to the Ancient Alien craze brought on by the crazies on ""Ancient Aliens"" on History Channel (IF ALIENS DIDN'T EXiST, HOW DID THEY BUILD EVERYTHING?!  I DON'T KNOW, THEREFORE ALIENS), by having someone rich and stupid enough front a trillion dollars for a deep space vessel to follow up on what they think to be a starmap in the form of pictographic carvings found all over the earth from far-flung, disconnected civilizations all portraying the same set of circles in the sky.Leaving side the obvious conjecture that maybe they all saw the same cosmic event or series of meteors rather than assuming it's somehow alien-related, the fact that this starmap leads where it does makes it a gaping plot hole, considering that the location the go to is one where the aliens clearly would never want us to ever find if we did manage to reach the technological level to find it and go to it.  Add to that the fact that it's a trillion dollar mission that could have ended up leading to nowhere if my hypothesis that it wasn't aliens was correct.There are no real ""characters"" to this story; they're little more than cardboard cut-outs with their personalities etched in their faces and speech.  Archetypes largely consisting of people with no discernable purpose beyond dying and being ""sciencey"".  Their only role in this movie is as ""Meat 1"", ""Meat 2"" and so on.Considering this is a TRILLION DOLLAR MISSION trying to find THE FIRST ABSOLUTE EVIDENCE OF LIFE OUTSIDE OF EARTH, much less ALIENS WHO CREATED US, this is facepalmingly stupid the cast of cretins they've gathered up for this mission.  I literally thought the random punk guy was some random mercenary hired on for protection, so I was genuinely shocked when they started relying on him being ""sciencey"" later on in the movie.  The rest of them are stupid enough to make people with even the most basic knowledge of archaeology and biology shake their heads.Considering once again that this is a TRILLION DOLLAR MISSION bent on finding LIVING ALIENS, I honestly thought it was either an inside joke or a jab at the people when they walk into an ancient cavern on the alien planet, unopened in 2000 years, and start TOUCHING everything, stepping everywhere, and SITTING on the artifacts.  There's a reason archaeologists use those tiny little brushes to dust off found artifacts; THEY'RE TRYING TO PRESERVE AND DOCUMENT A SITE; THEY DON'T JUMP INTO A PIT OF BONES AND START KICKING SKULLS AROUND.They also see fit to take off their helmets, just because the air is breathable.  Nevermind the fact that people are strongly urged to immunize just to visit another country for fear of contracting some unknown disease, these people are on a WHOLE OTHER PLANET UNTOUCHED BY HUMANS OR ANY LIFE FORM FOR TWO THOUSAND YEARS.  The TRILLION DOLLAR MISSION could've ended then and there with all of them dying of space-smallpox, and all due to their own stupidity.Pretty much from the moment of their arrival, the movie plays out less as THE STORY OF OUR BEGINNING and more like a typical horror movie.  I had constant instances of deja vu with this movie reminding me of scenes from ""Alien vs Predator"".  Even the characters had exactly the same tones and reactions as those in AVP.Michael Fassbender is a great actor, but his performance here is terribly uneven, though it seems more to me symptomatic of bad writing than any fault of his own.  His entire opening sequence of him watching Lawrence of Arabia, combing his hair like Peter O'Toole, riding his bike while shooting perfect hoops in basketball, and just walking around maintaining the ship play him up as a bright-eyed innocent, an android fully aware of what he is and giddy to learn more about the world and himself.  Then at random instances, he becomes sarcastic, dry, seemingly malevolent, even snotty, enough to arouse suspicion in a child, much less supposed scientists on a TRILLION DOLLAR MISSION.  He then pulls a temporary heel turn with a little ""science"" experiment that would be considered crude and reckless by Medieval standards of medicine---people DID practice quarantine back then.I say temporary because as the film progresses some more, this action of his not only proves to be pointless, but is subsequently dropped and ignored for the rest of the film.Then comes the whole moral of the story... I see a lot of positive reviews mentioning that it's okay that the story ""doesn't explain"" everything, or that it's not the film at fault if you ""don't get it"".Well I got it.  What I got was grade-school navel gazing hiding its own childishness behind a slick veneer of cool and hip to dismiss any criticism as ""You just didn't get it"".As much as I trash on ""Ancient Aliens"" on History Channel, I find the idea of paleolithic contact to be utterly thrilling, only waiting for even the slimmest shred of evidence to justify giving it further exploration.  This movie began with something like that, and close to the end, completely dropped the existential navel-gazing unaddressed to turn to the philosophical quandry of a bawling child wondering ""Why is daddy hurting me?""From there, another gaping plothole emerges; the aliens are suddenly hostile towards us, and the humans can't understand why.  They then proceed to make up reasons that completely ignore the facts; we're BAAAAAD people!  We burn fossil fuels!  We don't recycle!  We kill each other!  We eat animals!  We invent big shooty guns and bombs!  We touch ourselves at night!It never gets that specific, but the ""Why me?"" wailing gets tired, fast, and suddenly I realized I don't care what the aliens wanted.  If they have a problem with us and are unwilling to negotiate, we can just kill them all.  They DID leave their planet full of a self-replicating biological superweapon ABANDONED for two thousand years, and then left us with the starmaps all over our planet!The ending is typical, and would seemingly open the door for sequels, though of the sort that would be close to nothing like this movie, and thoroughly unwanted or uncared about.  Considering they had devised this great plan for the human race, it seems downright nutty of the scientist to STILL want to meet with them and ask them ""Why me?""As for visuals, I suppose they were impressive.  I wasn't impressed with them; CGI is cheap, fast, and easy these days.  A dozen movies are churned out with better and better visuals and plots and characters just as bad every year.  Boasting the greatest special effects with no substance to justify them will only make the movie look quaint and silly in 5-10 years when something better is done.I found a slight comparison with this film and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and realized it was literally the exact same basic plot:  Man finds evidence of ancient aliens, invests in a deep space mission to seek out the aliens based on their map, stuff happens, only one survivor and their pet robot.What separates this from ""2001"" is that ""2001"" told a story that needed no words; it was the story of us, open to all manner of interpretation, with scientists actually behaving like SCIENTISTS---Poole and Bowman kept their calm when they suspected HAL of lying to them, they casually gathered inside a space pod to discuss it, they didn't freak out and start cursing at each other or playing childish games of pretend with a damn SUPERCOMPUTER thinking they could outsmart a machine designed to read people like a pamphlet.In ""Prometheus"", they don't let you think, at least not the way you're expected to.  You're not left thinking about our beginnings, or the ancient alien concept, so much as wondering the same dumb question of ""Why us?"".  In fact, when we saw the movie, the only thing we kept wondering about is exactly what the alien at the prologue did and whether he knew what was happening.  I don't think that is what the filmmakers wanted.",1,Ordinary action/horror/sci-fi Hollywood,1345420800,"08 20, 2012",2012,8352,"['think', 'movie', 'near-hysterical', 'marketing', 'campaign', 'did',

1474976,A2JDYUSI2RILEB,B005LAIHXQ,Andre Dursin,"[23, 36]","Ridley Scott's triumphant return to the science fiction genre may have started off as a prequel to his 1979 classic ""Alien,"" but PROMETHEUS is a very different type of picture: a suspenseful and captivating film with provocative concepts and thematic material that challenges the viewer as much as it satisfies on a rich aesthetic level.Its ""Alien"" aspects - and there are some - are secondary to a story that asks where the human race came from, how we got here, and where we're going. Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof's screenplay posits these eternal questions in a manner that's positively refreshing in our current age of soulless blockbusters, opening with an utterly beautiful prologue set on Earth at the dawn of time (shot in Iceland by Scott) and proceeding to follow a spaceship crew in the late 21st century setting out to uncover the answers.Among the crew of the ship ""Prometheus"" are scientists Noomi Rapace and Logan Marshall-Green, gruff captain Idris Elba, icy cold Weyland corporation exec Charlize Theron, and a curious android named David (Michael Fassbender), the work of the elderly Charles Weyland (Guy Pearce) himself, who funded the mission to track down the whereabouts of beings who left ""calling cards"" on ancient cave paintings around the globe. Upon arriving on a desolate planet, Rapace and company find a dank, deserted chamber with remnants of an alien race that fled the scene some time before - as well as a gooey chemical substance that's anything but benevolent.It's easy to see why some viewers expecting a straight-ahead ""Alien"" prequel may be turned off by ""Prometheus"": this film isn't just a variation on its predecessor, with a group of disparate characters running around in the dark from a monster. Its brilliance is due to Scott's blending of familiar genre conventions with a story line that's deeper and more involved than most viewers may be prepared for. Granted, there are times when you wish certain plot points were clarified more than they are - especially in a mid-section that seems a bit rushed - but what's left unanswered aren't so much flaws as they are concepts left intentionally dangling for viewers to further contemplate. It may be less accessible to the masses than ""Alien"" but it's also emotionally stronger and deeper in terms of what it's attempting to do and say.Rapace's sensitive performance resonates strongly here in the latter regard, giving her character an emotional vulnerability that's wholly sympathetic - not just a Ripley clone, her Elizabeth Shaw is the moral epicenter of a crew that watches as their lofty hopes of finding out where life came from turns into a nightmarish assortment of questions about why the would-be Gods are trying to destroy them. Shaw's unshakeable faith is intriguingly tested by both the circumstance the crew finds themselves in, as well as her unusual relationship with the mysterious David, whose motivations are never entirely made clear in an otherwise fine performance from Fassbender.Scott's penchant for amazing visuals are, of course, on-hand throughout the film, and there are a handful of dynamic set-pieces: a thrilling storm that threatens the crew is later followed by a harrowing ""medical"" sequence and a sensational finale with a truly miraculous sense of scale. The director said in pre-publicity that he wanted ""Prometheus"" to be ""big"" and the film is indeed that, both in the messages it develops and the visuals on-screen. Spectacular effects and haunting creatures include concepts that resemble the work of H.R. Giger, giving fans a taste of the universe that Scott first brought to the screen with ""Alien"" but here in a very different context. (In fact, if there's a moment that feels somewhat out of step here, it's in a quote from Jerry Goldsmith's unused main title from ""Alien"" that comes across as unnecessarily shoe-horned into the picture).Dariusz Wolski's cinematography and even the score, credited to Marc Streitenfeld but enhanced with a lovely theme by Harry Gregson-Williams that's used throughout the picture (so much that it's surprising he only received an ""Additional Music"" credit), are likewise effective: this is a film that's filled with so much artistic invention and memorable images that one can see sci-fi fans returning to ""Prometheus"" for some time to come, both to dissect its narrative as well as take in its amazing artistic design.Throughout his career, Ridley Scott has shown himself to be a master craftsman in terms of imagery: not just in his classics like ""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner,"" but also in the commercial failures of ""Legend,"" ""1492"" and ""White Squall."" Throughout them all, Scott has brought the beauty of nature and, indeed, different worlds and even whole universes to life, very much like an artist painting on a blank canvas. While not without its flaws, ""Prometheus"" ranks not only with those films visually, but has one of the most compelling story lines from any of Scott's works, as well as an emotional range that's particularly surprising at its conclusion. It's a movie that stays with you long after the credits have rolled, a film that entertains and engages, a sublime mix so rarely seen at the movies any more.",5,"Challenging, Thoughtful, Captivating

1474979,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B005LAIHXQ,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 3]","Ever since the initial trailer for `Prometheus' was released and the dynamic score (which is sadly NOT utilized in the film) overtook the scenes of apparent suspense and horror, I was driven by an insane sense of passion, to see this movie.  I'm a huge fan of the franchise, despite some of the later films falling off `so-to-speak', and Ridley Scott is one of my favorite directors (the man has such range) and so to see him returning to the film that made him a household name (his 1979 `Alien' is still very much the best in the bunch) was something that made me really excited.But life is busy and this is NOT a children's movie and so I never made it to the theater to see this.That said, on a big screen at home with surround sound and the lights out, this is pretty impressive in its own right.  To place this up against the other films in the series is somewhat unnecessary but wholly expected and unavoidable and so to see the fans semi-disappointed and the critics throwing complaints at it, I wasn't surprised.  As a whole, I think `Prometheus' works well in the context of the type of film it is.  As for being something `more than that', I don't know if it was as successful.`Prometheus' flirts with the idea of delivering to the audience answers or explanations to life's biggest questions.  Why are we here?  Who made us?  What is the purpose of life?  These are questions that everyone asks and so few feel as though they have a genuine answer to.  This is a hefty undertaking for a horror film to try and take on, and for the most part `Prometheus' kind of drops the ball entirely and without unapologetically at that.  It just doesn't seem to care that it never even attempts to answer these questions.  In fact, it basically leaves off where we started, with a certain individual intent on finding the answers to those questions.And the journey repeats itself.And then again, maybe that is the point.  Maybe the point being made by `Prometheus' is that there are no answers, at least not easy ones, to those questions and so man's life is spent in an endless circle of a journey trying desperately to uncover answers they will never fully grasp or understand.  When confronted with the opportunity to find out, they are met with hostility and irrational behavior and, in most cases death.  In `Prometheus' we find a group of people with varying ideas of what these answers are worth, and varying lengths they will go to uncover them.  Sadly, the open-ending leaves the viewer feeling almost jilted; betrayed by a promise of closure (especially for fans of the series expecting something provoking for a grand finale of sorts) and left with a taste of unresolved differences in our mouths.And yet I don't hate this, and at the end of the day kind of love it.Like I said, for the mere fact that `Prometheus' only flirts with this concept and then entirely gives it up in order to focus on the more mechanical aspects of the genre, I give it a pass.  It doesn't really want to be something deeper, we just wanted it to want to be.  Instead, it really wants to be an effects heavy horror film, and it delivers in spades there.  The suspense built is remarkable (that abortion scene alone is ridiculously effective), the special effects are spectacular, the production department had a field day creating these sets (that stun, by the way) and the overall development of certain key characters (David for one) is pitch perfect.  Rapace, Fassbender and Theron are fantastic here, delivering beautifully crafted characters that reach out further than the confines of the genre would suggest.At the end of the day, the film works.  It may not be what we wanted, but it certainly should be what we expected.",4,The beginning of pangs of distress...,1363910400,"03 22, 2013",2013,3717,"['Ever', 'initial', 'trailer', 'Prometheus', 'was', 'released', 'dynamic', 'score', 'sadly', 'NOT', 'utilized', 'film', 'overtook', 'scenes', 'apparent', 'suspense', 'horror', 'was', 'driven', 'insane', 'sense', 'passion', 'see', 'movie', ""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'franchise', 'later', 'films', 'falling', 'off', 'so-to-speak', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'one', 'favorite', 'directors', 'man', 'such', 'range', 'so', 'see', 'returning', 'film', 'made', 'household', 'name', '1979', 'Alien', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'best', 'bunch', 'was', 'something', 'made', 'really', 'excited.But', 'life', 'busy', 'NOT', 'children', 'movie', 'so', 'never', 'made', 'theater', 'see', 'this.That', 'said', 'big', 'screen', 'home', 'surround', 'sound', 'lights', 'out', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'own', 'right', 'place', 'up', 'other', 'films', 'series', 'somewhat', 'unnecessary', 'wholly', 'expected', 'unavoidable', 'so', 'see', 'fans', 'semi-disappointed', 'critics', 'throwing', 'complaints', 'was', ""n't"", 'surprised', 'whole', 'think', 'Prometheus', 'well', 'context', 'type', 'film', 'being', 'something', 'more', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'successful.', 'Prometheus', 'flirts', 'idea', 'delivering', 'audience', 'answers', 'explanations', 'life', 'biggest', 'questions', 'Why', 'are', 'here', 'Who', 'made', 'What', 'purpose', 'life', 'are', 'questions', 'everyone', 'asks', 'so', 'few', 'feel', 'have', 'genuine', 'answer', 'hefty', 'undertaking', 'horror', 'film', 'try', 'take', 'most', 'part', 'Prometheus', 'kind', 'drops', 'ball', 'entirely', 'unapologetically', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'care', 'never', 'even', 'attempts', 'answer', 'questions', 'fact', 'basically', 'where', 'started', 'certain', 'individual', 'intent', 'finding', 'answers', 'journey', 'repeats', 'itself.And', 'then', 'again', 'maybe', 'point', 'Maybe', 'point', 'being', 'made', 'Prometheus', 'are', 'answers', 'least', 'not', 'easy', 'ones', 'questions', 'so', 'man', 'life', 'spent', 'endless', 'circle', 'journey', 'trying', 'desperately', 'uncover', 'answers', 'will', 'never', 'fully', 'grasp', 'understand', 'When', 'confronted', 'opportunity', 'find', 'out', 'are', 'met', 'hostility', 'irrational', 'behavior', 'most', 'cases', 'death', 'Prometheus', 'find', 'group', 'people', 'varying', 'ideas', 'what', 'answers', 'are', 'worth', 'varying', 'lengths', 'will', 'go', 'uncover', 'Sadly', 'open-ending', 'viewer', 'feeling', 'almost', 'jilted', 'betrayed', 'promise', 'closure', 'especially', 'fans', 'series', 'expecting', 'something', 'provoking', 'grand', 'finale', 'sorts', 'left', 'taste', 'unresolved', 'differences', 'mouths.And', 'yet', 'do', ""n't"", 'hate', 'end', 'day', 'kind', 'love', 'it.Like', 'said', 'mere', 'fact', 'Prometheus', 'only', 'concept', 'then', 'entirely', 'up', 'order', 'focus', 'more', 'mechanical', 'aspects', 'genre', 'give', 'pass', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'be', 'something', 'deeper', 'just', 'wanted', 'want', 'be', 'Instead', 'really', 'be', 'effects', 'heavy', 'horror', 'film', 'spades', 'there', 'suspense', 'built', 'remarkable', 'abortion', 'scene', 'alone', 'ridiculously', 'effective', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'spectacular', 'production', 'department', 'had', 'field', 'day', 'creating', 'sets', 'stun', 'way', 'overall', 'development', 'certain', 'key', 'characters', 'David', 'one', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'Rapace', 'Fassbender', 'Theron', 'are', 'fantastic', 'here', 'delivering', 'beautifully', 'crafted', 'characters', 'reach', 'out', 'further', 'confines', 'genre', 'would', 'suggest.At', 'end', 'day', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'what', 'wanted', 'certainly', 'should', 'be', 'what', 'expected']",N/A

I have seen all of the Aliens movies and consider the original Alien one of my favorite SciFi movies of all time.  Prometheus has a weak disjointed storyline that was hard to follow and often made little sense.  Example, the head of Weyland Corp., the company owning the spaceship, makes a holographic visit early in the story, I presumed he was dead, and near the middle end he appears on the spaceship and is promptly killed by the giant, resurrected alien/human.  Similarly the Charlize Theron character bickers with the crew early on and then fades into the background and her role becomes unimportant.  Also, the resurrected giant alien, not the monster but the genetically human giant, starts immediately fighting with all the crew members for no apparent reason. Of course there is included the obligatory decapitated, talking android head who saves the day.There was nothing exciting about the 3D effects.  If you see it in 2D you will have not missed anything.In summary, this was a must see movie for me and probably everyone else interested in the Alien series, but it is not one of the better SciFi movies I have seen.

I'm a fan of Idris Elba from alot of british shows and Charlize Theron is almost always good in her roles. I don't see alot of mesmerizing performances in sci-fi movies simply because too much is usually going on story-wise to get deep into characters. That is true in this film unfortunately, i say that not because the characters weren't explored early on and introduced through story (they were) but since i didn't feel emotionally attached to them like in some of the more memorable films i've seen. It's very hard to create that sense of feeling for a character in a few hours as opposed to tv where when an actor dies it's enveloping after watching for an entire season(walking dead, sons of anarchy, etc.) Overall, i was entertained and would say that this movie is to this franchise (alien) what terminator salvation was to it's franchise, just another installment. I've rarely seen preqeuls or sequels that are better than the original and this lives up to that stereotyping. I have to admit my #1 reason for renting was i crave sci-fi films which are few and far between unless you like the cheesy network b-movie variety and #2 was I'm a fan of Charlize Theron.

The plot is rife with holes, scientific method advisers were clearly not consulted in the studio's rush to get this movie out after god knows how many years since Alien now? And these aliens look way too much like us to be scary.There are astronaut zombies and cobratic phallic hissing dentata-face things, as suggested by other reviewers. But it's more like a horror scifi Tone Poem. A sort of visual symphony. With proper logic notes and implausible hues, it kinda draws you into a world that's vast and alien, yet with archetypes sprinkled throughout which awaken glimpses of prescient wonder, harkening back to our genetic memories. What would confronting your creator be like? How would You fare?Sir Ridley Scott has created a particularly potent world, and populated it with dunderheads. Monty Python in outer space might've done better, even survived the events. Benny Hill would've made it out. I'm talking about some of the writing required to get the crew from point A to point Z in the movie, with all the scares intact.  The actual actors played it perfectly. And even the characters were well rounded, for their roles. I think many sympathize with Shaw, as many as with David. When he says ""I think I can,"" at the end, it's chilling.Themes in the movie delve into lineage, mortality and genetics, with emphasis on an alien catalytic fluid, where accelerated dna dissolution and recombination yields voracious organisms that quickly wipe everything out, morphing towards their host's form with every generation. The end of the movie is great in that regard, by the way.Monsters? Exploding heads? Zombie spacemen? Self-induced abortion of a tentacled demon foetus? All there.Presentation is epic. Sets feel totally real. Costumes, setting, lighting, spacecraft, effects? Magnificent. Biblical at points.This is a companion to Alien, more than a prequel. What else happened in that universe, that Ripley happened on to? The events are in different planets... so it's easy to think of them as nearly simultaneous. So while Shaw is off looking for the creators, the colonial marines are getting splattered.It would be soooooo freaking cool if Blade Runner was tied into this world somehow.

There is also an android crew member and a determined heroine, just like the other Alien movies.The plot centers on a team of scientists who land on a planet thought to be inhabited by extraterrestrial beings. One of the scientists thinks the beings created humans, but there is no evidence of this. Later on, a specimen is recovered and its DNA sequence is found to match human DNA. All this proves is that we are related to the beings, not that they bioengineered us from scratch. We could have been deposited here by another intelligence and left to evolve before the beings discovered us.If the beings did create us, did they create us in our present state, or did they create earlier homo species? If they created earlier homo species, they would have to have created chimpanzees. The reductio leads to the conclusion that they created all life on the planet. It is too much of a leap to say they created us.The crew thinks the beings (the ""Engineers"" as they call them) are using the planet ruins as a biowarfare lab to exterminate humans. Eventually, one of the Engineers is awakened from a stasis chamber and tries to kill the expedition team. So, clearly there are signs that the beings are hostile. But at the end, Noomi Rapace announces that she wants the android to fly her to the Engineer home world. If they want to exterminate humans, why would she want to go near them? And how would they sneak in there? They'd be intercepted and killed before they could touch down.Like most science fiction films, the extraterrestrials say nothing interesting. There is no indication that the beings are intelligent aside from their technology. The film makers need to do more than show us the interior of their spaceship to demonstrate their eminence. After all, the awakened Engineer behaves like an uncaged brute.

The harsh tone of a distant Arctic land (actually Iceland) can grab the viewer.I went back to the movie theater twice after the first viewing and still marveled at the cold and dangerous place.Director Ridley Scott once again showed his touch for the artistic and stunning. He also did the original 1979 film and then no more. Like some other reviewers I long felt that ""Alien"" was one of the best all-time science fiction movies. Right there with 2001,and in some ways much better.Scott said he wanted to go back and find out more about that giant pilot with an exploded chest in a crashed ship on a distant moon. Where was that alien from, and on what kind of mission?To make up for lost time, Scott loads Prometheus with lots of high-tech, plot and characters (the ship now has a crew of 17.) But you will still find the evil corporation reps there, along with a very determined Ripley type, played by Noomi Rapace of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo."" She really carries on the Ripley determination. And don't forget the robot---here identified right from the start. But which side is he on?There is a new dimension to the Alien story which where prehistoric cave paintings seem to point toward that distant moon, and our ancestors (or creators?)Lots of excitement, and  very scary moments.You might wonder whether the certain sequel to this prequel will develop the distant ancestors as the prime feature.

A space faring alien race seeds seemingly countless planets with life and then seems prepared to return to them and distribute not a bio-weapon, but a biological collation and collection machine. That machine, if you could call it that, is actually a microscopic lifeform with a unique form of sexual reproduction. Unlike the modes of asexual and sexual reproduction known to science today, this fantastic lifeform can breed with any species, of any size, while not only harvesting all of the most beneficial traits of its parents, but also consistently producing viable offspring. An ability of terrifying potential. Given a short time, this chimeric lifeform would essentially unite all living creatures within any given ecosystem into a single hydra-like monstrosity of unimaginable intelligence, complexity and adaptability. I saw the ancient alien race of engineers grand plan not being one of biological extermination, as was postulated by the terrified astronaut explorers, but one which would bring together nature's grand designs from all corners of the Galaxy. Imagine, for a moment, what the result of the fruits of thousands of planets' long evolutionary histories would create if brought together. It would undoubtedly be the birth of an unthinkably complex and powerful being.Unfortunately for Ridley Scott, this movie is not for religious people, or the scientifically illiterate, and as such it has unduly received a tremendous amount of negative reviews. As for the reviewers using phrases like plot holes, or lack of continuity, these people are either ill informed as to the definitions of these terms, or just small minded, there were no such drawbacks.

The film was filmed in 3D (not post-converted) and it looks amazing. There aren't any artifacts that pop out at the viewer, but the depth within the environments is amazing.  Highly recommend watching the 3D version. I'll do a review of the Blu-ray set when I receive it.As for the film, it was very enjoyable throughout. The reason for the 9 rating is because I felt like it was missing something.  The film was 2 hours long, and it feels like it should have been a two and half hour long film.  I think we needed more exposure with the ""engineers"", showing how they operated and even created the weapons contained in the urns.  I think we needed to get to know the crew better so we could feel more for them when certain members perish or are hurt.The pacing of the film was excellent, never seemed to get boring, but I think certain scenes could have built up the suspense a little more.  The camera work was excellent, and the environments look amazing. The technology and visuals were impressive.This film is in the same universe as Alien, but is not a direct prequel to Alien. It shouldn't be compared with Alien.  It's a different type of film as Alien, as was Aliens (Cameron's).

So I ordered the 3D Blu ray and I must say that after watching the movie once, I was supremely disappointed.  I wrote a scalding review here which I have subsequently removed.  I didn't have nice things to say about this installment.  The problem for me was that the story didn't seem to make much sense: actors where doing things that didn't make much sense and the logic just seemed off.  For a movie of this caliber, the actors, the director, the special effects etc.  It just seemed like the biggest mistake of their careers.Recently I was on a long transatlantic flight and I had some movies loaded onto my ipad.  One of them the classic Dune and another Prometheus (With high anticipation I had loaded Prometheus onto my ipad before seeing).  Long flight, what the hey I played the movie again after watching Dune.It opened my eyes.  The symbolism was all there.  The movie only makes sense when you look at it through the lens of ancient mythology + ancient christian and other belief systems:  sacrifice, rebirth, survival, motherhood, giving birth, circle of life stuff.  Seen through this lens, the movie is brilliant just like Dune.I found myself sad that I had taken Prometheus too literally the first time around and that I didn't give proper credit to the writers, directors, actors, and special effects team.  These people went out of their way to create a beautiful masterpiece here and I didn't even ""get it"" at first.  For this I am deeply sorry.Give this movie a chance.  Almost every scene, every line (even the background lines) and little actions by the actors has symbolic meaning.  The robot's behavior is brilliant when you taken into consideration all of the symbolism.The challenge is that because they put so much symbolism into the movie, you wind up with logic gaps.  It sometimes appears that the characters are not making rational decisions.  This is quite literally very true.  That's because there are multiple stories being told here.  So you have to suspend the logic portion to get the broader symbolism aspect of the movie.  Maybe they tried to do too much I don't know.Thank you to Ridley Scott for making this.

Same thing that usually goes wrong with many a film today: too much focus on effects, not enough on character or story. This less-than-stellar film was directed by the innovative Ridley Scott, which makes it that more disappointing. ""Prometheus"", in a roundabout way, is a prequel to the ""Alien"" franchise, pre-dating Scott's classic 1979 film. Ironically, the last major sci-fi offering was ""Avatar"", made by James Cameron, who directed the first ""Alien"" sequel ""Aliens"" and it was much better received than ""Prometheus"", although there have been many complaints about ""Avatar's"" unoriginal story. But somehow, that film transcended the detractors. Scott's ""Prometheus"" could not. And it's all-too-apparent why. Except for the effects, this is pretty much an awful movie in EVERY possible way: lazy storytelling, odd dialogue, poor characterization, bad acting (mostly due to the odd dialogue!). The film has a self-important aura that's undeniable. The movie tries unsuccessfully to explain the origins of man in a manner in which, frankly, could have been told better by a grade-schooler!""Prometheus"" asks more questions than it answers. And that's fine since we are talking about the beginning of life as we know it, and that should be a mystery. But the questions this movie asks are as abstract, vague and open-ended as can be! In this movie, everything is left up in the air. The film says that an alien race, called ""Engineers"", created life on Earth as we know it, then for some unknown reason in the 21st century decides that the human race must be annihilated. The characters, consisting mostly of ""scientists"", spends the film's entirety not really doing anything scientific, logical, or that even begins to TRY to answer any questions! Virtually everything the scientists and crewmembers do is a detriment to the mission, not an enhancement. In particular, the 2 scientists, who in my opinion, should be the MOST important to the mission, a geologist and a biologist, literally don't care anything about it and spend their limited screen time acting like scared, clueless buffoons. They don't do anything ""scientific"". The nominal mission leader, the corporate lady Vickers (played by Charlize Theron) tells the 2 archaelogists whose discovery on Earth even led to the mission happening that they can't ""talk to"" the aliens. What does this even mean? She doesn't even believe that there's anything on the planet worth discovering, so why even tell them something like this? It's like the character knows what's happening before it's supposed to happen. So you would think Vickers knows something. She doesn't! She's completely clueless throughout. There are other instances like this where character actions and dialogue almost seem to illogically preface the actual turn of events. The script-writers really didn't proofread their own material!The actual star of the film is Naomi Rapace (never heard of her), who plays archaelogist Shaw, but she is apparently acclaimed from several foreign films, and Scott does her character no favors. Shaw has a chemistry-lacking love story with the other archaelogist Holloway (played by Logan Marshall-Green, never heard of him either). We are to accept them as an already-established couple, but the flat dialogue undermines them, as well as the rest of the cast, boasting several talented and acclaimed actors, most notably the aforementioned Theron (an Oscar-winner!), Guy Pearce, Idris Elba, and Michael Fassbender (who plays the android David, by default the best and most interesting character of the film). David is supposed to be an android, but he has an all-too-obvious ""Data"" vibe (from Star Trek:TNG). He at times seems too ""human"" to be convincing and he does an inordinately amount of head-scratching things in the movie. In fact, every single character does something that makes no sense. EVERY one of them! Elba plays Captain Janek, whose sole responsibility is ensuring everyone's safety and he has an pretentious cowboy quality about him. Not sure who Elba is emulating in this weird performance. Pearce for some reason is in old-man makeup for the entire film. I was waiting for the scene where the Engineers would reverse the life-cycle and make him young again. Never happened!Perhaps the biggest violation of ""Prometheus"" is in it's not-so-subtle and confusing ties to ""Alien"". Not really a direct prequel per se, the film still has to be connected somehow as the ship that the crew finds on the planet is similar to the one found in ""Alien"", with the Engineers seeming to be from the same species as the space jockey from ""Alien"", and finally a revelation at the end that would reveal that ""Prometheus"" MUST be connected to ""Alien"". But, again, many more questions have popped up now than have been answered. It makes what's going on in ""Alien"" all the more confusing. And THAT is a huge violation as ""Alien"" is a masterpiece that doesn't deserve to be tainted by this awful film!",1,Suprisingly superficial!,1401753600,"06 3, 2014",2014,5076,"['PROMETHEUS', '2012',

Its been some years that Iv'e gone to a film that has truly blown my mind. Most of Science Fiction today is so poor and embarrasing, that it hurts to watch. This is the return of true Sci-Fi genius and done by a master of the genre.Some people are saying, ""They didn't explain that"", or ""I don't get it"", or ""that doesn't make sense."" Well, not all films explain everything, and to me, that's a good thing. I was glued to my seat the whole time and my palms were so sweaty, I dropped my pop.I'm not going to go into a massive rant about the effects, or the plot or the macabre sets. There's plenty of those reviews here.(Thumbs up to Michael Fassbender who's performance as the android David was extrordinary.)So my point is basically do what other reviews have said, ""don't expect Oscars"" and go into this with a clear head and forget about ""Alien"". Even though you'll want to watch ""Alien"" as soon as you get home from the theatre.I want to give this 5 stars but I have to go with my gut and give it 4 and a half stars. Still a remarkable accomplishment.This is truly unbelievable filmaking and this is what Sci-Fi is all about. Take it for what it is, a spetacular ride from start to finish.And thanks again Ridley for a truly remarkable film. Cannot wait for ""Blade Runner 2.""

1475063,A30TQET02FLSUX,B005LAIHXQ,BLACKBOXBLUE,"[0, 0]","MOVIE RATING:  3.5 stars (B)Sir Ridley Scott is back...to making smart sci-fi movies. Prometheus (2012) is his ""prequel"" to the Alien franchise that he started in 1979, and his first sci-fi film in 30 years since his cult favorite Blade Runner (1982). I REALLY wanted to LOVE this movie. Not just like it, but all-out love it.  If only Scott had a better story to match the greatness of everything else that he brought to this fantastic visual and aural blockbuster. Still, there's a lot to love here. And maybe my expectations were so high that there was no way for the film to ever live up. I just saw it yesterday, so I probably need more time to fully appreciate all its details. But my initial take on Promtheus is that it's very good, but not outstanding and not Scott's best work. Sorry, Sir Ridley!!! You know I love your work though. Gladiator (2000) is my current #1 movie of all time. And Thelma & Louise (1991) isn't far behind.Prometheus is an origin story, much like every other sci-fi/fantasy movie of the last decade. But this is about the origin of mankind, not some superhero. So it's grounded in something more realistic and relevant...at least initially. It's picking up the gauntlet thrown down by director Stanley Kubrick with 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). If only it didn't just pick it up and then put it on the shelf to be forgotten about. The movie opens with two archaeologists discovering a 35,000 year old cave painting in Scotland that has 6 orbs floating in the sky of its drawing with a large humanoid pointing at them. It's in that 35,000 year old mystery, that the story got me VERY intrigued, in the same way Stargate (1994) got me with it's ancient Egyptian alien archaeology. However, instead of really delving into the origins and mysteries of life on earth and the big questions of is there a God and how did the universe come into being, Prometheus simply turns into a guts-and-glory horror action flick halfway in. At that point, no one, human or alien really cares anymore about the big questions of life that got this whole journey started. They're simply concerned with killing life at whatever cost.I love that the humanoid aliens seemingly created us, but now want to destroy us. But WHY? I don't need a definitive answer, but couldn't we have at least played with the question for awhile after asking it? But maybe that's all Promotheus was ever supposed to give us. I guess I expected more from Sir Ridley Scott at this stage in his filmmaking career. I wanted him to bring the smarts and finesse in his other great films to this one. Now, maybe, just maybe, these questions are meant to be looked at in more detail in Prometheus 2 and 3, which seem likely to have been on Scott and 20th Century Fox's minds during the production of this first one. But as a moviegoer, I want each movie to be complete and great on its own merits as well as across its subsequent sequels if and when they happen. What if we don't get another Prometheus? Then we're left with a movie that's really just a one-act ""trailer"" for something that could have or should have been. I know I'm being harsh on Ridley Scott and his team of thousands that worked hard for years to give us Prometheus. But I expected more from a guy who didn't even make the sequel to his original film that helped start this current Hollywood movie franchise mess.Ok...now that I've gotten out the bad, it's time for the good. Prometheus is one of the most visually stunning sci-fi movies of all time. It's pure eye candy from the first frame to the last. Every shot, every graphic, every visual effect, and every set/location just wowed me on the big screen in 4k digital projection. This film was completely shot on the Red Epic digital cinema camera and it shows just how fantastic and ""filmic"" digital cinematography can be. I hear the arguments, most recently by director Christopher Nolan, about how digital is not yet at the same level as film, but if Prometheus doesn't put the final nail in that coffin, I don't know what else possibly could. I never once wished that Prometheus was shot on film. It was just so perfect in digital. In fact I don't think it could look as good in film, especially with all the visual effects. I give Director of Photography Dariusz Wolski and his camera team kudos for helping craft one of the best looking movies ever. This movie, and Wolski, better be a candidate for Best Cinematography at next year's Oscars.In terms of acting, Michael Fassbender once again steals the show...this time as an android named David. But most of the cast does a fine job in their contributing roles. I didn't really like Noomi Rapace as Elizabeth Shaw though. I think a better actress could have brought more to the role, but she's satisfactory. She's the protagonist that we are being told this story through the eyes of, and maybe that's partly why the story didn't sink in with me as much as I wanted it to. Her character just didn't have the human and emotional character depth that Fassbender's robot had. And I think that's a problem when the robots are more human than the humans. Sigourney Weaver brought something more to the party in her role as Ellen Ripley. Idris Elba was great as the ship's captain, but I wanted more of him. And Charlize Theron played a ""bitch"" as good as anyone can. That's a compliment by the way. I would've liked to found out more about the humanoid aliens that created us. One would assume they are as intelligent as us, if not more, but we're given no one to connect with. Too bad.The production design on Prometheus is breathtaking and epic. I can't even imagine all the work by hundreds if not thousands of people that went into designing and building the sets, ships, vehicles, costumes, and props of this world. Arthur Max brought the same greatness to the production design of Prometheus as he brought to Se7en (1995), Gladiator (2000), and Black Hawk Down (2001), all three visual masterpieces.The sound on Prometheus is just as epic and important, if not more so, than the visuals. And the entire sound team executed with precision and power. There's really nothing else to say about it. You just have to hear it in a huge way on the big screen and you know exactly what I mean. The music on the other hand, by composer Marc Streitenfeld is a mixed bag. Half of it is perfect and the other half felt weird to me. Some of the music just didn't fit emotionally in my opinion. I noticed several times that I was taken out of the storytelling because of the music creating the wrong mood. I was surprised because I certainly didn't expect the musical score to not fit on a film like this. I can't really think of any sci-fi film that it hasn't fit on.While Prometheus doesn't quite live up to the high expectations I had for it, the bottom line is that I ABSOLUTELY 100% suggest you see it.",4,Big Questions that ALMOST get big answers,1355616000,"12 16, 2012",2012,6856,"['MOVIE', 'RATING', '3.5', 'stars', 'B', 'Sir', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'back', 'making', 'smart', 'sci-fi', 'movies',

1475068,A20IIR0422G3A5,B005LAIHXQ,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[1, 2]","I'll get the visceral reaction out of the way quickly. I was disappointed with the movie the first time I watched it, from a director who gave us the original ""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner"" plus gripping non-sci fi films such as ""Black Rain"" and ""Gladiator"". The best thing I can say for Director Scott is that I believe the primary problem is not with the premise, which had enormous potential, but in the plot and the line by line writing. But, I watched it a second time the next night, and some of the kinks were ironed out by noticing some lines. Also, the relevance of the Prometheus myth became far clearer, and through it, I realized an important back story explanation which was obscured by the characters' ignorance. Read the Prometheus story before watching the movie and pay very close attention to the opening (and think 2001 opening.)One indicator of how incomplete things seem is that the very old billionaire, Peter Weyland, is played by a fine middle aged actor, Guy Pearce, but we never see him younger in flashbacks, which were probably cut from the final editing. Without giving too much away, the Peter Weyland character adds very little to the story aside from being the person who funds the mission.I sensed something was seriously out of joint when the ""away team"" enters the cavernous artifact. After encountering something just a bit squeamish, the geologist Fifield (Sean Harris) and biologist Milburn (Rafe Spall) decide to return to the Prometheus (the name of the humans' interstellar space ship.) The remaining team does a fair amount of exploring. Among other things, they see a hologram of the intelligent giants, drawings of whom they found on Earth. they are seeking running from some unseen danger. I saw no clue to what triggered the hologram. Following the hologram, they find the decapitated head of one of the giants (as opposed to the 'aliens' we encountered in earlier films).The captain of the Prometheus sends them a message that a serious storm is approaching. The team, with the usual annoyingly distracting side efforts which slow them down, reach the entrance and begin driving their vehicles back to the ship. But, and here the train falls off the track, never to return, we find Fifield and Milburn still in the artifact, when they said they were returning to the ship. They found some kind of life which intrigued the biologist. But why didn't the team returning to the ship notice that none of their vehicles were gone. Why did they leave the other two behind? Somehow, the two truants don't get the warning about the storm, or ignore it, so they become stuck in the artifact.There are loose ends aplenty with the alien fauna on this desolate world. My expectation coming in was that the film would explore the origins of two creatures, the ""Alien"" and the race of the giant pilot discovered by the crew of the mining ship Nostromo in ""Alien"". We meet the giants soon enough, but we also encounter at least three other life forms which have a passing resemblance to THE Alien, but their connection to the life cycle of the Alien is never explained.I'm entering dangerous ""spoiler"" territory now, so I will not discuss any more of the plot except to say that there are a number of unexplained events. Mysteries are great in the middle of the film, but one expects most of these to be wrapped up and revealed at the end of the picture. Many are not, leaving a huge jumping off point for a sequel to ""Prometheus"".Part of the special attraction of this story is that the audience knows full well what will eventually happen, so there is a lot of mental ""don't go there"" and ""don't do that"" moments, because we already know what things that look like that can do. The problem with that is that there is too much ""quoting"" from ""Alien"" for my tastes. Most of it is done relatively well, but it becomes more and more obvious as time goes on, and increasingly annoying. There is also ample quoting from other major Sci Fi movies such as 2001: A Space Odyssey (both in situations and in dialogue). There are also some subtle cinematic (visual) quotes from ""Avatar"" and ""Jurassic Park"".One of the bright spots, aside from the imaginative, well done CGI and cinematography, is the acting, which I always thought was a weak spot in ""Alien"". The crewmen, such as Captain Idris Elba, are spot on (unlike Yahpet Kotto in ""Alien""). Instead of the strong Ellen Ripley character, we have the physically smaller and less imposing archaeologist, Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) who sports a convincing English accent as the lead character. Charlize Theron's character is restrained and unlikable. Like both Scott and Cameron's ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"", this movie has an android (artificial person) as a principal character, in a role much fuller than in the earlier movies. The only thing which distinguishes 'David', Michael Fassbender's android from Scott's earlier android Ash (Ian Holm, Alien) and Cameron's Bishop (Lance Hendrickson, Aliens)is that David is ever so slightly stilted, somewhat like Data from ""Startrek, The Next Generation.""I will give this the benefit of the doubt for now, but I found a strong disjoint in the rationale between two early scenes and the climax. I sense Scott wanted to leave plenty of meat on the bone to support a sequel. (In contrast, Avatar is almost totally devoid of preparation for a sequel I suspect I will need to revisit this review after seeing the film again. If my suspicion about gaps and disconnects is born out, I may have to lower my rating to 3 stars.",4,Not your daughter's Alien.,1350777600,"10 21, 2012",2012,5530,"[""'ll"", 'get', 'visceral',

Even with the emergence of Aliens and Alein 3 certain keys were relatively maintained so as to respect the original movie.Some 15 years or more down the line from the last relatively cohesive sequal, Prometheus' opening was of critical interest, forcing me to the movie theatres after a decade or more hiatus. I didnt want to miss one special feature or 3D effect. I even saved the movie tickets...Well the movie missed the mark -numerous times- with its cliche's and somehow obvious mishaps. Several things annoyed me about this movie and I have listed them here...1) Mogul and developer Weyland seemed to look like a professional makeup job more so then anything else and he was not entirely convincing in my oppinion-2) Weyland's daughter in charge was too similar to other Hollywood actresses doing not so similar cryptic roles in recent years. She was also too white-washed. The script was extremely predictable and she seemed more a fashion style study ie decked even with high heels reminiscent of the present then looks of the far future setting.I would assume, based on the time of the film, that Weyland's daughter could be genetically enhanced but at the same time she seemed to be too cold and authoritative to convey earthy fear and vulnerability, a stirring effect well used with Sigourney Weaver. I will say at certain times she did try though. In that sense, the film turned its back on the original Alien and the sequels which were often so subtle and sensitive that a definite mood was created and maintained.3)The emergence of several characters and mechanized voices with a pronounced ""English/British"" accent was over burdening and seemed to be a recent trend concept and surely not based on the movie setting at all which seemed to ignore the dominating all ""American"" working class tone of the original movie and several sequals.4)Several times the robot droid said phrases that were actually echoes of the first film. Examples are ""impressive"" or ""its organic"" I keep wishing they had left those words off the script or used other descriptives.5) The connection of the engineers to creating us ""the human race"" even though it was what ""they"" the cave scientists/doctors ""chose"" to believe- was kinda ""off center"" and most definently not what the general consensus would seem to be open or bothered with as thought or concept but that could be arguable. It was annoying for me and a million miles away from welcome images of ""God' or ""Allah"" and also truly not developed in any real clarifying sense. The extra terrestrial being was completely believable however and convincing as an alien life form to me. When the DNA matched us ""humans"" to the alien engineers, I was disappointed as it ruined some important mystique of their character and origin.6)The ""far out"" engineer/alien could have been maintained at around 10 feet in height for spooky effect vs 7.5 feet range as it appears in key screen shots and angles on film.7)The fact that the planet was different from the original Alien film is because as I recall in second sequel Aliens, the planet was ""nuked"" or blown up. That seems to be the main forgotten fact of the film that I can understand thus-far although dates and times would play a key part in confirming. So far with that there would be no return to the original planet which could have been more cohesive in a way.8) Although the alien pyramid design scheme was marginally successful to me, it could have been ""developed"" further in numerous ways even though I think a truly original scheme would be easy to do that could match the same tone of originality as the first Alien film. I think the artist HR Giger could have played a pivotal hand in the design of the pyramids beyond what he had already done albeit with more time.9) The octopus creature that would emerge from the med pod was marginally successul even though it resembled a robust or large octopus. I dont think too much work was needed on that creature but the ""zenophile"" that would emerge from the impregnated engineer at the end slipped when it opened its mouth. Neither the roar nor the mouth extension was needed to me. By having the creature quiet and examining the darkish surrounding environment would have easily set a more cryptic, haunting tone for the future.10) The fact that other space craft and engineer pyramids exist on the planet is slightly irritating to me because it reveals too much about what else is on the planet as a whole. By having several pyramids in the same area atleast allows for more space craft without giving away too much information on the rest of the planet and that gives room for a sequel on that subject matter alone. A possible way to capitalize yet on another sequel that is not forced to address the ""end all"" questions of the engineer/extraterrestrial origin or home.11) When the female doctor at the end said that she wanted to know where they ""the engineers"" came from she seemed relatively shallow, hasty and childlike. Not a bother much but it seemed thrown togethor with no follow up on just how the droid and remaining supplies could offer the opportunity for such long term, precarious exploration away from earth much less other humans and communication.On another note, I am sure that to find the Alien engineer's home would be and is going to require some of the best Hollywood sci fi designers available first to try to pull it off with success.12) The alien craft which is probably the most original and ""other worldly"" ever- really needed force and momentum for the final ending scene of its ascension from underground. I am talking sounds or unusual light effects that could have gave it soom needed life. At the end, when the ship began to fall back to the ground it made no substantial noise- in a way there was no strong sense of debris or crashing and breaking which could be permissable but really isnt to me due to its size, the cargo and how the internal materials related in the film. Instead it ends up reminding me of a doughnut of sorts. When the ship ascended it should have had an unusual sound, vibration, light effect and or sense of motor. It instead was lifeless and forgettable despite the superb untypical design of it.13) When the humanlike robot droid predicted the engineer was headed to earth to ""destroy to create"" it seemed off regardless of the supposed weapons development. In fact the engineer should have never been headed any place necessarily known. What would have been better was if the engineer reacted more hostile, sensitive or inquisitive about the humans entering the flight navigation room. The engineer did in fact react to the humans as if they were cousins or relatively familiar entities and was not fearful or threatened even though the creature seemed on an inner time clock programmed to begin flight or shut down and go into hyper sleep. That part could be believable for even more important reasons but the inclusion of earth as destination should have been omitted because there is no solid exploration of the alien engineers having any lomg term qualm with the earth or humans atleast directly to destroy. Their own problems with contamination or outbreak seem to open room once for further look but closes the need to return to earth in lieu of their original interest in seeding the planet with their DNA or the first communications with human beings to me.14) In the beginning of the movie the alien who supposedly seeded the earth with its DNA was disappointing. I did acrtually think they were on their home planet not Earth. In this case we are treated to desolation and what appears to be briefly a mormon or sorted religious figure as the space engineer's into. The need to seed the planet is plainly a unconfirmed or more so explored concept and really could have been omitted. The flying saucer in the beginning arguably used did become literally vertical at one point as it ascended back into space but it was unimaginative even seemed worth little as something to pay attention to. One could have seen it as a lunar event or something like an eclispe because detail was truly absent.Overall I would not bother with this film although its stellar moments are  extraordinary. Scenes with the engineer were never without amazement but trust me one will have to pick and choose key parts to survive the films goof-ups. It seems that the directors and everyone involved should have seized at the chance to really make certain parts shine as bright as others. Attempts should have been made to enhance wherever they could to balance the movie out. Basically its slightly less intricate then the first three Alien films though it makes a good effort from time to time.What is so annoying is that the concepts introduced here are a bit disruptive and substract from certain other elements.In conclusion it would be the Bonus/Extras disc that would have the most informative material on the movie itself and much more. Although it is a 7 hour segment and I only viewed 3 hours as of yet it was worth looking at. Loads of sci fi imagery, imaginative details, models, drawings, computer work, scaled demos, prep work, scripts, alternate endings make up for any movie shortcomings and has been recommended viewing with near A+ ratings from several news publications and critics.The bonus extras will do many times over what the movie only attempts. Also the screen saver phase before the ""Bonus"" feature begins literally ""blows one away"" with linear, dreamy, super science effects as if at a flight console of a futuristic vehicle getting ready to fly to another distant planet on and on... The screen saver has program data and information on what to expect in the distant planet.Finally one could not help but get a sense of haste in this movie in relation to the original Alien film which was studied, slow and effectively detailed. What is most promising for the future though of the Alien movies at this point is that the engineers are not yet proven to have created humans which they do not set the tone for necessarily and the female doctor at the end has yet set out on the seemingly impossible problematic course to find the engineer beings home planet. All new subjects to develop on.3D and digital formats were not discussed directly in this review.So for now I am returning to hyper sleepPeace till the next sequel-)End",5,Prometheus never quite

It wasn't until I watched the making of Alien that help me to move beyond dramatic scenes and watch how they created the aliens. So, when I heard Ridley Scott was creating a prequel to the blockbuster hit Alien I was kinda leary about going to the movies to see Prometheus. But, I ordered the movie and was pleasantly surprised it wasn't as gruesome as the 80's hit. Good storyline, two scientist are granted a multi-million dollar expedition into outerspace to conduct onsite research to find out who/what is behind the start of life on planet earth. What's funny to me is, they didn't have any type of security or planned protection if/when they got there, how to protech themselves.  They didn't have anything planned, no rules of engagement or protocol?!? They just jumpped off the spaceship and ran into a unknown cave and the movie went from there.Special effects were top notch, weird scences, and the ending was not satisfactory for me.

The story is engaging and enough was left for the imagination to make you exited for potential sequels.It's not a five star movie for a few reasons (may contain spoilers):- the movie felt too short, it seems like certain things should have been explained better such as the motivation of the engineers in the very beginning potentially creating humanity and in their desire to later destroy it. Maybe this is left to the imagination or for sequels, but a little more background would have been nice.- there was a crew of 17 but most of them had little no screen time or simply disappeared, this should have been fleshed out better, again this may have needed more time or was cut out- many pointed this out but crew behaviour was reckless, the biologist getting cute with the snake, people putting their fingers in all sorts of questionable things and messing with stuff better left alone and in general no respect for the environment- David's motivation for infecting the other guy was not clear to me.

Some of them decent, but mostly bad. So, leave it to Sir Ridley Scott to create a smart science fiction film that sets the film in the `Alien' world, but doesn't rely on it as a cheap way to market the film. Naoomi Rappose (from Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) is a breath of fresh air, with her excellent performance as the crew leader Shaw, but it is David the robot, (played by Michael Fassberer) which deliveres the performance that most people will be talking about. Simply amazing. For me, what makes this film so great is the perfect balance between the amazing action and exploration, allowing audiences to fully immerse themselves in the world. The controversy surrounding the film in regards to being 'confusing' is quite ridiculous, so if you do get the chance, make sure to see the film in IMAX 3D for an out-of-this world experience.Best bit?Giving birth to a human child is the most wonderful and joyous occasions that could happen.

Schar,"[1, 2]","""Prometheus"" certainly looks great; its production design echoes ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"" without being a slavish copy; it's shot well, and its locations and milieu are convincing.  However, like a pretty girl with no brains, good looks aren't enough to keep you happy for more than a few minutes.  It doesn't start well, with the movie being very confused about a solar system vs. a galaxy vs. planets.  (It doesn't help that later there is discussion of being ""half a billion miles from Earth.""  Um, Pluto is further than that.)  Then you scratch your head more when you discover that this trillion-dollar mission is crewed by an assemblage of idiots and putzes who are briefed on the mission _only after they wake up from hypersleep_.  I'm not buying it.  I'm also not buying how the Engineers can have human DNA when biochemistry and genetics show that all animal life on Earth has common DNA elements, and human is 99% chimpanzee DNA.Stuff happens, some more convincing than others, and we reach the third act.  The last 45 minutes or so kicks into gear, and makes you suspend your disbelief.  Nooma Rapace channels some Sigourney Weaver in her own way.

1475089,A6WZVL0SRQAPY,B005LAIHXQ,Brian Driver,"[1, 1]","THERE ARE NO SPOILERS WITHIN!I liked ""Prometheus"" a lot, but there are just a couple of really important things I found wrong with it.  I found I wanted to give it two scores, which of course is not possible under the auspices of  Amazon.  I decided, therefore, to treat the film as if it were allowed to get those scores, then average them.  Hence, the three points.THE GOOD:It is stunning from the opening shot: a sweeping, panoramic vista lies ahead, one in which nature is seen in its forbidding glory.  It is the Earth in its formative days, and as the camera swooshes along, the viewer soon finds himself at the top of a waterfall where a Prometheus, indeed, stands in all his glory: a huge, silvery proto-man who drinks a liquid under the shadowy form of an nearby spacecraft.  It can only be his species' ship, and we watch the liquid take effect his body granulates, crumbling into the water and washing over the falls, apparently on its way to seed the planet with his DNA.Several million years later we find ourselves in the near future, and we are now part of an archeological team that has made an apparently stunning discovery in Scotland.  It is one more piece of a puzzle they have assembled, culminating in a plan to discover our birthplace in the stars.It's a glorious and stirring opening, very much like Spielberg might have done it.  It is done with little dialogue, little formal exposition, but the objective is clear to all (though at the end of the movie there may be more questions than answers). It's an excellent start worthy of a promising movie concept.This kind of epic, iconic storytelling is director/producer Ridley Scott's forte, and it is one for which so many have been on tenterhooks: the prequel to the equally iconicAlien [Blu-ray] made in 1979.  It's a daunting task, as over thirty years have passed since the original.  Pleasing everyone will be an impossibility.  But does he come close?""Prometheus"" is lush and breathtaking throughout.  Whether you are traveling along with them in their spaceship, or on the planet where the clues to our ancestors may rest, the movie is beautifully rendered and/or photographed.  The setting, therefore, is one of the GOOD points.I can say the same thing about the special effects, which are awesome without being overpowering...I really dislike movies whose makers have decided that good CGI is abundant CGI, and therefore every shot has thousands of soldiers or ridiculously sized monsters or packed cityscapes full of so many clever gimmicks and gadgets that the scene is impossible to comprehend.Thankfully, Ridley gives us sumptuous shots and amazing FX without these drawbacks, and the ultimate effect is positive: grand planetary vistas, frighteningly forbidding chambers, and monsters that can hide in a drop of black fluid.  Again, done very well.So...the beauty, pageantry, and special effects win ""Prometheus"" a 5.And then we get to the story.THE BAD:It's not so much the WHOLE story...just parts of it.I get it that this crew has been selected to travel across the universe.  I get it that a millionaire--hell, billionaire--is funding this expedition, and he's not only hand-picked the crew, but also hired one kickass captain to command the mission.BUT: If these are the very best scientists in their field, there is a pretty sad dearth of scientists around.  First of all, the team has no PLAN.  They never work on a way to approach the site.  They land and immediately rush out of the ship.  When they find a site where interesting specimens might be there is never any caution...they simply go right after it.  And not only do two of them miss their transport back to the ship right before a hellacious storm, but they find REAL LIVING ALIEN BEINGS and get all gootchy-gooey with them...saying, ""Come on, little feller.  Come on...ooh, you're so cute. Come on over here...""AND YOU'D NEVER GUESS WHAT HAPPENS.Honestly, this REALLY detracted from the movie.  It was so beyond STUPID, even IMBECILIC, that I felt as if the movie were insulting me.  And a lot of the later behavior seemed similarly ridiculous.This bothered me for more than the obvious reason...I felt that it really hurt a good movie.  I know there are a lot of people who feel the movie was faulted because it didn't answer all their questions about ""Alien,"" but that didn't bother me.  (I'd heard that there was one more film coming, PLUS the film itself pretty much says so.)  And as to the other main complaint of many fans: I simply don't hate films that leave me with questions.  Why can't they?  Isn't life like that?But those DAMN scientists, and the whole crappy team of idiots on that ship...they really did, and still do bother me.  It spoke to such a lack of credibility.That aside, I really loved how beautiful ""Prometheus"" looked, and I loved the overarching story.  In fact, in almost ALL other ways, I loved the movie.  So a 1 for the plot line, and a 5 for the technical beauty of the movie.Make up your mind: if you want to see a really beautiful, gorgeous movie that ALMOST answers your questions aboutAlien [Blu-ray] rent (or buy) ""Prometheus."" But when those damned scientists get to work, close your eyes...",3,Terrific!

Stupid me, I pre-ordered from Amazon and just received, watched it. My title explains my feelings.  The only thing I hope comes out of this is that someone makes a movie, different writer and director, of where the Aliens came from and why they created humans.There are number of things that make this unbelievable; e.g., David learns the language by studing early earth languages, but how can he read the Engineer's writing, as the Engineer's spaceship crashes and roll towards them, Vickers and Shaw run in the same direction as the roll instead of to the side and out of its' path.After wathing the extended and deleted scenes with the commentary on it was apparent that all these deletions were done for time, even if they helped explain the movie better.  This was done to keep the time to about 2 hours which allows more showing at the theater - pure profit motive.  I think they did this because they knew that they had a real lousy movie and needed to make their money ASAP.Reviewers that gave this a 4 or 5 star only proves the point that America is becoming the stupidest country in the world.

1475106,A3I7YI4NMP6SV8,B005LAIHXQ,"B. Wells ""CineMan""","[5, 14]","A couple of days ago I read a review of Ridley Scott's ""Prometheus"", and the film critic's biggest complaint appeared to be that he found the film to be very confusing.  First of all, I'd like hear what this critic has to say about one of David Lynch's films; if he was addled by ""Prometheus"" then ""Mulholland Drive"" must've had him scurrying for the exit.  Because, while there are surely complaints to be made about Scott's nominal ""Alien"" prequel, confusing it is not.In the year 2089, while exploring caves in the cliffs on Scotland's Isle of Skye, a pair of archaeologist/lovers (Noomi Rapace and Logan Marshall-Green) discover an ancient ""star map"".  Soon enough, they realize that the location of the stars in the image matches up EXACTLY with similar drawings from other ancient cultures.  Four years later, the sinister Weyland Corporation is jetting the pair, along with a complete crew--mostly self-serving and unlikable types--to a distant planet that may be home to humanity's creator(s).  The starship is named Prometheus and its occupants include corporate bigwig, Meredith, an Ice Queen (Charlize Theron) who is too-obviously up to no good (or is she?); Michael Fassbender's David, both devilishly good-looking and just devilish as the corporate android with several agendas; and Janek (Idris Elba) the ship's stalwart captain, who is probably the most sensible one of the bunch.Once on the planet, the explorers find themselves in a series of interconnected caves that turn out not to be caves at all; they also find that they are not alone.  There are several different species of creatures, one, our ""creators"", not even indigenous to this particular planet.  There are some spooky scenes, too, although none come close to the claustrophobic terror of Scott's original ""Alien"".  When one of the female members of the mission suddenly finds herself (impossibly) pregnant and graphically aborts the ""fetus"", it's somehow reminiscent of that dinner table scene in ""Alien"" when the creature bursts out of John Hurt's chest.  It's a queasy, disturbing scene that stays with you.Noomi Rapace, so captivating in ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" and its sequels, is completely believable as archaeologist, Elizabeth Shaw, wearing her conflicting emotions like a Kabuki mask, her shell-shocked victim eventually giving way to Ripley-like heroics.  As her other half, Logan Marshall-Green--looking more like a male fashion model than a seasoned archaeologist (not necessarily a complaint)--is also heroic, yet much more vulnerable than Rapace; when he says he wants to ""meet his maker"", he gets more than he bargains for.  Charlize Theron uses her blonde, athletic good looks in the same way that Michael Fassbender uses his--both seem like androids but only one truly has that distinction, and both are dripping with malevolence--but I think that Fassbender gives the better performance.  In fact, considering that he's playing a robot, Fassbender arguably gives the best performance in the film.  The rest of the cast aquit themselves nicely, but some seem like stock characters spouting stock dialogue and doing various stock things until it's time for their characters to get killed off.Above all, the special effects in ""Prometheus"" are wondrous; the team who created the ships, and this world with its strange and dangerous beings, are true artists.  The musical score, by Marc Streitenfeld, is portentuous and exciting, and there is a sleek sexiness to the costumes worn by most of the characters that would be equally appropriate for a superhero movie.The movie questions the morality of creating life only to later seek to destroy it, assuming that alien beings would have the same sense of morality as humans.  It also presents searching for our origins in space as an elusive task, at best, one that is pursued at considerable peril, and with an almost certainty of deadly consequences.

1475110,A2983KT3N8FGM0,B005LAIHXQ,Calder,"[0, 0]","This film is visually jaw-dropping on a big screen. I would go so far as to say that this movie looked better at the theater than anything I have seen in years. We have a sizable home theater, but I am glad I did not wait for the video release. A friend strongly recommended seeing it in 3D. Having seen it in that format, I disagree. Some of the scenes are very dark. While the 3D is done pretty well, I do not think you necessarily have to see it in 3D - in fact I think it gave some of the very dark scenes a muddied appearance. I do not yet own the 3D blu-ray, so I cannot comment on how the darkest scenes translate to home systems.From a technical standpoint this film is Ridley Scott on steroids. It is shot very well. The cinematography, editing, effects, acting, sounds and action sequences are all done extremely well. There are a couple of action sequences in particular that are just relentless and leave you feeling drained. This is the type of film that sucks you in and doesn't let you catch your breath. I'm not even a huge fan of the sci-fi genre, but I could easily watch this again.If Amazon allowed half-stars, I would probably give this film four and a half stars instead of four. It isn't a perfect five star film. There is a tremendous amount of violence and some of it is very gory - bordering on gratuitous in a place or two. While I wasn't especially bothered, the person next to me hated it for that very reason. The storyline does have a few weak points, but nothing too serious. Also, I thought the ending was OK, but not as believable as it could have been. Again, none of these things mattered a great deal to me, I was very impressed with this movie. The biggest drawback for me personally was experiencing some of the excessively dark scenes in 3D - I would probably watch the 2D version if I had it to do over. I actually caught myself removing the glasses a couple of times, but of course that will just make things worse when watching 3D formatting.It is not for the squeamish, but if you enjoy good science fiction - it really doesn't get much better than Prometheus.",4,Prometheus is a superb looking film that excels on the big screen,1341187200,"07 2, 2012",2012,2104,"['film', 'visually', 'jaw-dropping', 'big', 'screen', 'would', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'movie', 'looked', 'better', 'theater', 'anything', 'have', 'seen', 'years', 'have', 'sizable', 'home', 'theater', 'am', 'glad', 'did', 'not', 'wait', 'video', 'release', 'friend', 'strongly', 'recommended', 'seeing', '3D', 'Having', 'seen', 'format', 'disagree', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'dark', '3D', 'done', 'pretty', 'well', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'necessarily', 'have', 'see', '3D', 'fact', 'think', 'gave', 'very', 'dark', 'scenes', 'muddied', 'appearance', 'do', 'not', 'yet', 'own', '3D', 'blu-ray', 'can', 'not', 'comment', 'how', 'darkest', 'scenes', 'translate', 'home', 'systems.From', 'technical', 'standpoint', 'film', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'steroids', 'shot', 'very', 'well', 'cinematography', 'editing', 'effects', 'acting', 'sounds', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'done', 'extremely', 'well', 'are', 'couple', 'action', 'sequences', 'particular', 'are', 'just', 'relentless', 'leave', 'feeling', 'drained', 'type', 'film', ""n't"", 'let', 'catch', 'breath', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'huge', 'fan', 'sci-fi', 'genre', 'could', 'easily', 'watch', 'again.If', 'Amazon', 'allowed', 'half-stars', 'would', 'probably', 'give', 'film', 'four', 'half', 'stars', 'instead', 'four', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'five', 'star', 'film', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'violence', 'very', 'gory', 'bordering', 'gratuitous', 'place', 'two', 'was', ""n't"", 'especially', 'bothered', 'person', 'next', 'hated', 'very', 'reason', 'storyline', 'have', 'few', 'weak', 'points', 'nothing', 'too', 'serious', 'Also', 'thought', 'ending', 'was', 'OK', 'not', 'as', 'believable', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Again', 'none', 'things', 'mattered', 'great', 'deal', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'movie', 'biggest', 'drawback', 'personally', 'was', 'experiencing', 'excessively', 'dark', 'scenes', '3D', 'would', 'probably', 'watch', '2D', 'version', 'had', 'do', 'actually', 'caught', 'removing', 'glasses', 'couple', 'times', 'course', 'will', 'just', 'make', 'things', 'worse', 'when', 'watching', '3D', 'formatting.It', 'not', 'squeamish', 'enjoy', 'good', 'science', 'fiction', 'really', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'better', 'Prometheus']",N/A

In a sense, Prometheus is similar to Contact as we as humans want to figure out the following:  ""What are we doing here?  And why are we even here?""  Or some questions that I believe that the Jody Foster character asked in that other film.I have to admit, I'm not much into the genre for the most part.  But that's only because many directors and writers tend to dehumanize the actors in science fiction for some reason; I think that most of the people in Sci-fi are just too mechanical and therefore not believable.  They didn't make that mistake in ""Contact"" for sure, a movie that I actually liked better because of the human element.  But the director here did a pretty good job, particularly by the third act, to give us some sympathetic characters, so kudos there.I think that this film did get some of the science correct.  There were issues though, of course.  Without giving much away, one of the main characters has emergency surgery (won't say why) but she is still able to ""bounce around"" pretty well immediately afterwards.  I didn't buy that.  Also, one of the doctors at one point during a diagnosis is using a tablet computer, and in my opinion, by the time that this film is set (I think almost 100 years in the future) you would expect most human-computer interaction to be voice-activated.  Also, one major issue:  there is an assumption that is made that I didn't buy at all, the assumption that, if you have someone become a linguist expert on earth that that being would be able to understand another language on another planet with ease.  Not.  Natural language appears to be inate to higher-order creatures on earth, but the structure of natural language on another planet may be totally different.  (A similar but worse error was made by Jeff Goldblum in some other unwatchable film, where he uploads a virus into an alien computer system.  Really?  I laughed out loud during that scene.)But overall, I'm giving this movie a recommendation for a view, even if you aren't really a sci-fi fan.

I think everyone was processing...This movie doesn't use the typical sci fi tactics to engage the audience... there isn't really a constant feed of mind-numbing visual action one would assume. This movie was done tastefully (for the most part) and speaking of good taste...wow, there is a really freaking hot guy in this. Logan Marshall-Green is so friggin' hawwwwwwt he made me smile just watching him. But prepare thyself because there is a price to pay for those good looks of his. I will not spoil anything but if you're squirmish, get ready!. .Initially it was hard for me to accept Noomi as the female protagonist for a few reasons. I'll just come out and say it: there is something off-putting about her facial structure and hair for me. Her bone structure is maybe just bad on film. I wanted to slick her hair back the whole movie because it was always in her face. Not to mention her accent in this. In the end, she won me over with her perseverance for answers despite the obstacles and her ability to survive. I can't say I'm sold on the idea that she would have pushed through all she did due to how her character was presented, but I accepted it and kept my eye on the idea her character brought up which is you may not like what answers you find that reside beyond your faith but the truth is freeing. She really is a pretty good actress so eventually my shallow reasons for not liking her fell by the wayside.I love the guy who plays the captain of the Prometheus- Idris Elba. He has a few cheesy lines, but I think he was good for the role. And ya gotta have the black guy! Charlize Theron is, as usual, wonderful to watch. Fassbender was pretty good but I never got why he was such a vindictive android plus I had just recently seen him in Shame and the transition from a sex crazed sad guy to android was a little (*cough*) hard to shake. Guy Pearce was okay at best being a gross old rich man; I wish they would have just used an old man though. Older actors need roles and this would have fit the bill for the right old man. And I REALLY wish they would have better visualized the ship itself since the movie was even named after it. I never got a good sense of the layout. One of the things I didn't like about this movie.SPOILER ALERT! The aliens in the movie are well done. I got so frustrated when the alien doesn't answer Dr. Shaw in some way after she pleads for answers and pours her heart out. In his facial expression, the alien seems moved by her briefly, but then the android steps in and just pisses him off. You'd think Mr. Weyland would have a better plan for first contact than to use an android as ambassador asking for sh1t. That is not how you get what you want. No less from an HR Giger represented alien species.Despite the stereotypical plot twists and tactics, I really enjoyed this film.

Ridley Scott returns to the Science Fiction genre in a major way with PROMETHEUS, a spiritual prequel to the 1979 classic ALIEN. PROMETHEUS falls very closely in line with the look, feel, and overall mood of the original ALIEN, following a similar structure that includes many familiar characters and settings. Where the two diverge is in their actual storytelling techniques. ALIEN tells a simple yet effective story that comes to a conclusive end after the rising tension found in the first and second acts. The unavoidable plot holes that frequent PROMETHEUS raise more questions than answers every step along the way, leaving the audience to question the writers intentions more so than the grandiose theological discussions that are being proposed. If one thing is for certain, however, it is that Ridley Scott has lost none of his command over this visual medium, creating a mind-blowing display of visual effects that take us well into the next century and beyond the farthest reaches of space. With the suspension of disbelief held high, PROMETHEUS can surely be enjoyed as an epic space adventure in search of far greater meaning amongst the stars.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",4,Prometheus,1359590400,"01 31, 2013",2013,1482,"['band', 'renegade', 'scientists', 'are', 'joined', 'members', 'Weyland', 'Corporation', 'explore', 'uncharted', 'planet', 'may', 'hold', 'key', 'creation', 'biological', 'left', 'world', 'previous', 'inhabitants', 'will', 'pose', 'deadly', 'threat', 'may', 'instead', 'mark', 'end', 'existence', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'genre', 'major', 'way', 'PROMETHEUS', 'spiritual', 'prequel', '1979', 'classic', 'ALIEN', 'PROMETHEUS', 'very', 'closely', 'line', 'look', 'feel', 'overall', 'mood', 'original', 'ALIEN', 'following', 'similar', 'structure', 'many', 'familiar', 'characters', 'settings', 'Where', 'two', 'diverge', 'actual', 'storytelling', 'techniques', 'ALIEN', 'simple', 'yet', 'effective', 'story', 'conclusive', 'end', 'rising', 'tension', 'found', 'first', 'second', 'acts', 'unavoidable', 'plot', 'holes', 'frequent', 'PROMETHEUS', 'raise', 'more', 'questions', 'answers', 'step', 'way', 'leaving', 'audience', 'question', 'writers', 'intentions', 'more', 'so', 'grandiose', 'theological', 'discussions', 'are', 'being', 'proposed', 'one', 'thing', 'certain', 'however', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'lost', 'none', 'command', 'visual', 'medium', 'creating', 'mind-blowing', 'display', 'visual', 'effects', 'take', 'well', 'next', 'century', 'farthest', 'reaches', 'space', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'held', 'high', 'PROMETHEUS', 'can', 'surely', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'epic', 'space', 'adventure', 'search', 'far', 'greater', 'meaning', 'stars.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",N/A

In saying that, it loses its way almost immediately. Prometheus is a confusing, uneven film with a plot that might make sense, but is beset by characters that make even less sense. An example, the Captain and lead scientist Elizabeth have encountered unbelievable hardships, terror and death, but in the very next scene they're chatting as if nothing has happened. The actions of the android are even more puzzling. Why does he `spike' someone's drink, knowing full well the possible repercussions?  Is it just because of his affinity for his favorite film's main character? Obviously the Three Laws of Robotics don't exist in this Universe. The film eventually devolves into silliness with medical systems that have no knowledge of female anatomy, to self surgery and then into guessing games as to why the aliens seeded our planet and why they're not so happy about it now. Yet, those questions might easily be put to rest if rather than referring to the name of the vessel Prometheus actually refers to the god who brought fire to earth.

After reading about some of the things that confused me and thinking about it some I decided to watch it again.Parts I still didn't like:- all parts with the geologist and biologist. Two wasted characters in my mind. A company spends a trillion dollars on a ship, you can make an assumption that they are going to find the best scientists around and that are motivated to be there. The geologist doesn't want to be there at all and can't wait to get back to the ship. Lame. The biologist is an equally worthless, underdeveloped character that is too stupid to not interact with a alien creature that is obviously not timid, and more importantly, wasn't there the last time they were in the 'vase' room. They got what they deserved.- as many others have commented on, trying to outrun a crashing ship behind you is almost comical. Moments later we see Dr Shaw roll a couple of times to dodge the ship after she trips. It was that easy. Lame- couple other things I won't get into.Good things:- The special effects are awesome (except for trying to outrun a crashing ship); the space craft are well done, the set in the 'vase room' is pretty neat, etc.- all scenes with the big alien. The fight scene with the tentacled creature is f'n amazing and worth watching a couple times.- at the end of the movie are some deleted scenes that are quite good. One is a brief conversation with the alien they wake up before it goes homicidal. Why they cut that out I have no idea as those few seconds add a tremendous amount to that scene. Another is a longer scene when the alien and Dr Shaw are together after the crash and before the tentacle fight.I could go on and on. I did expect more but was not as disappointed as others seem to be. It is a miss from Alien quality that's for sure but I still enjoyed it. 'Enhanced' will definitely make it more enjoyable.

Giger & ""Alien"" got a slow trickling of information about the movie release of ""Prometheus"". It's story, plot and origin were a complete mystery and should remain that way until you view it. The mystery surrounding the movie is as intense, mysterious and teasing as the trailer included with this review. In fact, the trailer is a fair depiction of what you will get with the film. You will get great science fiction, intense gut wrenching scenes and mysterious cave drawings that lead scientists to another world.Don't talk to many people who have already seen ""Prometheus"" before going. You don't want to know. If you enjoy great science fiction and you enjoyed the ""Alien"" series of movies, just go. ""Prometheus"" is beautiful and horrifying at the same time. It isn't for the squeamish. I will be ultra careful not to tell too much as well.Those familiar with the ""Alien"" series are also familiar with the name ""Weyland Industries"". They are the corporation behind the original ""Alien"" movies. They are the money and brains behind the operation to explore alien life forms. So when Elizabeth Shaw, played by Noomi Rapace (who rose to fame with the Swedish ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" movies), finds cave drawings all over earth that are similar, it leads her and her boyfriend Charlie Holloway to question our origins. Who are we and where did we come from?""Prometheus"" is more thought provoking than action movie. Not to say that the action isn't plentiful, but the thought and development that went into the film are top notch, as well as the acting, direction and cinematography. There really isn't much to criticize about the film. ""Prometheus"" is pure and simple, great escapism cinema. You will be gone away for two hours to a place that will have you thinking, wondering and cringing.There have been a great variety of summer movies this year and Hollywood has finally learned a valuable lesson about moviegoers. We want variety. ""Prometheus"" is possibly one of the best science fiction movies of all time, emphasis on the science. It mixes the ""Alien"" genre with a great movie like ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". It does what every great movie should do, make you question and make you think.

I saw the display at the theater last year and had it on my list to buy from that point on. I don't do many movies in the theater. I prefer to buy them later on Blu-Ray and save the money. It's cheaper to own most movies than to take my wife and myself to the theater, and we can watch at our leisure.While I was waiting for delivery I started reading some of the reviews and found out it left a lot to be desired. It was a good movie, and since I no longer expected it to be on the same level as Alien, I enjoyed it. I try to watch movies for the entertainment value alone, and if it is something I really enjoy then go back and watch to see if I can find deeper meaning and mistakes. Knowing some of this movies mistakes ahead of time made it a little harder to do that, but, it made me understand I should not expect quite the movie I'd planned to see.That being said, it was a good movie. It was entertaining, it did have some character build out. The affects were great, it was fun to see the ship design, the image of the ""Engineer"" in his control seat with his helmet on that matched what we saw in Alien on the crashed ship. The shape of the ships, the development of the creatures as they assimilated DNA from their hosts. Even the corridors in the base brought back images from the Alien movie.I recommend this movie, BUT, I recommend you sit down to watch it without the assumption you will be blown away like the first Alien movie did.

Generally the casting is pretty good: Michael Fassbender once again proved how versatile he is, playing a quirky intelligent robot, Charlize Theron is convincing as the cold ambitious commander of the ship and Noomi Rapace generally plays the lead well.The film unfortunately had a lot of elemental flaws, often seeming to follow a clich&eacute;d horror film rather than recapturing the originality of the first Alien film. The peripheral characters have stock roles making it clear who will die first and stupid mistakes are made, such as opening the ship's hatch to an infected team member, the captain leaving the tracking board to go and have sex when the machine has picked up the signal for an alien life form, and generally characters having a very lax approach to quarantine procedures. I think the most ridiculous moment occurs at the end of the film when Noomi and Charlize continue to run in the path of a falling space ship instead of just taking a couple of quick steps to the side and easily avoiding it...Having said all that, the film does fit in quite nicely with the Alien films and it definitely kept my attention throughout: the story was compelling and the 'abortion' scene was suitably disturbing.

You hear that phrase a lot in action movies.  Take that phrase and let us consider its meaning in a literal sense.  Do you want to meet your maker?  Most people would answer a definite yes.  And that is the underlying theme of this ambitious, thought-provoking movie.  Throughout the eons, man has been longing to meet his maker.  Various belief systems have arisen to address this very desperate longing.  But, what would happen if technology has advanced to the point where this desire of the human heart can now be fulfilled?This movie was inspired by the works of the Swiss author, Erich Von Daniken.  He was the one who had originally proposed the idea that an advanced race of space travelers have visited Earth in the distant past.  And not only that, these ancient visitors have had an impact on the development of civilization, technology, and perhaps even the human species itself.  The works of Zacharia Sitchin have also had a clear influence on the themes of the movie.  Sitchin's works have claimed that a group of advanced humanoids called the Anunaki have influenced ancient humans and their ways of life.The premise of the movie is that a pair of researchers uncovered ancient clues that space travelers may have visited Earth in the past.  Cave paintings and drawings, from diverse geographical locations and different time periods, all indicated the same symbol.  The symbol is a unique star formation.  A star map.  Within the drawings, there is always a figure of a tall humanoid pointing to the stars.  The researchers concluded that this meant an invitation from the ""Star People"" to mankind.  With the help of Weyland Industries, the researchers embark on a long journey to the distant star system shown on the star ""map"".  After a two year journey onboard Prometheus (the ship), the research team is woken up from their deep sleep and arrives at the destination.  Among the crew is an android, David.  David is an advanced, synthetic humanoid created by the CEO of Weyland Industries.The Prometheus descends on the planet, entering its atmosphere.  Analysis showed that the atmosphere will not support humans.  Donning on their protective gear, the crew sets off to investigate a mysterious structure on the planet's surface.  The structure seems to have been artificial, not natural.  Upon entering the structure, they discover the remnants of what appears to be an alien scientific base camp.  Further exploration took the crew to a temple-like room, littered with metallic cylinders.  An unknown black substance is oozing out of some of the cylinders.  David, with his superior intellect, discovers a recorded hologram of events that took place on the facility more than two thousand years ago.  Meanwhile, Drs. Shaw and Ford decides to bag a preserved alien head in order to take it back to the Prometheus for further study.I don't want to spoil the plot for you.  Suffice it to say that the ending will be a surprise.  The reasons for David's mysterious behavior and strange choices will be revealed as the plot unfolds.  Yes, the crew will end up finding a living specimen.  And those acid-blooded creatures from ""Alien"" do make an appearance.Technically, Ridley Scott has said that this movie is not a direct prequel to ""Alien"".  However, it was inspired by that film franchise, as well as by the works of the authors mentioned above.  HR Geiger's artwork and style also dominate the movie sets.  As you may know, Geiger designed the original Alien.  He also designed Sil, creature in the movie ""Species"".  And clearly, the same ferocious creatures in the Alien franchise also are present and wreaking havoc in this film.  The special effects are what you would expect of a high-budget Ridley Scott movie.  Everything about this movie is top-notch.  And that includes the nearly all-star cast.This is the best science fiction movie that I have seen in a long time.  If you are looking for movie in this genre that offers more than action thrills and special effects, then this is it.  And, you will be pleased to know that unlike some of those other ""cerebral"" Sci-Fi movies that start off slow, this one actually gets off to a fairly fast start.

He practices the languages that may of in fact be the language of ""The Humanoid"" and later on is rudely dealt with though perhaps his undoing had more to do with not knowing the ""Humanoid"" rather than not speaking its language.The disaster that unfolds does place opportunity as a reckless even provocative position whereby none will survive.The utter careless and as well uncaring path that the entire crew followed was anything but careful or perhaps even more to the point even scientific.There was a hands on approach to such danger that only death can be thanked for getting rid of these idiots.Death here is more than merely the unknown,it is in fact what may be driving this mission to begin with, with the results being something predictable and not entirely unexpected.""Dave"" possesses a loyal and pre-determined position whereby his creator may in fact be ""The Weyland Corporation"", ""Dave"" so it seems is following orders. ""Dave"" is very dangerous and this concept is most certainly not lost on Dr.Shaw.The name of the ship is ""Prometheus"" with the year 2089 being the year that this picture for the most part takes place.The Crew was placed in a state of suspended animation with the time of 2 years 4 months and 20 days having been eclipsed as the ""Prometheus"" traveled from one galaxy to another in a location suggested to be the galaxy ""Alpha Centuri"".Something of a look a like to this particular Milky Way world that presently the Earth is located.The ""Humanoid"" like individual is difficult to know as his or its purpose is as well not entirely understood.The Reference earlier to Photographs is suggestive as an illustration of what this race of humanoid beings might be capable of-It appears that the ""Humanoid"" may only if anything be many copies of himself.This is indeed perhaps even a startling discovery that this discovery is not as yet knowable however The ""Humanoid"" is more than merely a threat.This is a dangerous development with a undetermined cause providing Its place at all.The picture leaves no doubt that the ""Humanoid"" is or perhaps was planning to attack the Earth and had the technology to do it or so it would seem.It is truly not entirely clear as to who or what this ""Humanoid"" creature actually in fact represents.Some of the film suggests gentically engineered DNA completing something of a quest as to Mans place in the Universe.There is not enough information though some might say more is needed to know.Appearing in a 2 Disc-Documentary, titled ""The Nazis:A Warning From History""There is a photograph of Nazi German Dictator Adolf Hitler looking intently at a bust of this films ""Humanoid"".This reference provides an integral link as to who this being in fact represents.He in fact represents an Aryan concept and further his place is as a superior human being.There is a fight nearing the films completion between The ""Humanoid"" and The ""Parasitic Octopus"" with the ""Parasitic Octopus"" indicating just how dangerous this creature was to begin with.The result appears to be a creature that defies pre-history.This was the result of the violation of Dr.Shaw whereby the ""Parasite""  came from a large depository,almost like a weapons hold and seem again to represent a underwriting of Bio-Terroism. This film is an attempt upon mans place and perhaps as well it prescribes another world entirely.This as it were alternative is not really an alternative but the end of this world and our place here as well.The threat that this film represents is truly felt with the discovery of both the ""Humanoid"" and the ""Parasitic"" developments.The Parasite should not be ignored however the ""Humanoid"" ship possesses a weapon which as much as it serves notice it is symbolic as well as in fact a very formidable looking development.This is in fact something that looks familiar as there is a War that is about to be Launched.It is a unmistakable Alarm that needs to be put in place to properly ascertain how to gauge this  threat.This is a real threat and a real threat is what this picture wishes to be. This is the agenda this world has underwritten with the Motion Picture and it is this motion picture that is conveying this threat.",4,A Threat !,1351900800,"11 3, 2012",2012,7144,"['Motion',

Hustwick,"[3, 7]","When I saw Prometheus in the theater, I thought it messed with the entire mythos of Alien, and pretty much undermined most of that amazing film -- but that Ridley Scott had crafted a science fiction experience unlike any other in years. It was quite mesmerizing to watch, and anything that has to do with discovering hyper-advanced Alien technology is sure to have me hypnotized  -- and there's a lot of that here.But take away the set pieces and this thing is a cobbled-together mess of a film. Not only is it totally new-agey, but it comes across as a juvenile recreation of 2001; the visual cues and themes are all over the place. And we all know that Scott loves Kubrick (just check out The Duellists). The plot winds up pulling some pretty clever tricks out of its hat with its total re-imagining of the Alien universe, and I think it should be given credit for some brilliant ideas particularly regarding the development of the species.But for me where the wheels come off is with the characters. Aside from the outstanding performance and subtext to Michael Fassbender's character (David), no one else in the film is anything better than standard Hollywood fare. Noomi Rapace is okay, but Charlize Theron is positively godawful and Guy Pearce is poorly misused.  The rest of the crew is totally throw-away, and as many other have pointed out, only seem to exist to serve the plot contrivances.So on the positive end of the spectrum you have some of the greatest, jaw-dropping (and thrilling) effects work in years taking place on a planet light years from earth, involving Alien technology, mutated viruses and androids -- while on the other end are weak characters, a gimmicky plot, and an underdeveloped metaphysical theme. Not the first time for Scott with that. The first film said everything that needed to be said, and only had to hint at the larger and more frightening aspects of the material. The biblical allegories are all over the place here -- just look at what he's saying about the development of the planet itself.",3,Shows its weaknesses on video.,1350604800,"10 19, 2012",2012,2037,"['When', 'saw', 'Prometheus', 'theater', 'thought', 'messed', 'entire', 'mythos', 'Alien', 'pretty', 'much', 'undermined', 'most', 'amazing', 'film', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'had', 'crafted', 'science', 'fiction', 'experience', 'other', 'years', 'was', 'quite', 'mesmerizing', 'watch', 'anything', 'do', 'discovering', 'hyper-advanced', 'Alien', 'technology', 'sure', 'have', 'hypnotized', 'lot', 'here.But', 'take', 'away', 'set', 'pieces', 'thing', 'cobbled-together', 'mess', 'film', 'Not', 'only', 'totally', 'new-agey', 'juvenile', 'recreation', '2001', 'visual', 'cues', 'themes', 'are', 'place', 'know', 'Scott', 'Kubrick', 'just', 'check', 'out', 'Duellists', 'plot', 'up', 'pulling', 'pretty', 'clever', 'tricks', 'hat', 'total', 're-imagining', 'Alien', 'universe', 'think', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'credit', 'brilliant', 'ideas', 'particularly', 'regarding', 'development', 'species.But', 'where', 'wheels', 'come', 'off', 'characters', 'Aside', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'subtext', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'character', 'David', 'one', 'else', 'film', 'anything', 'better', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'fare', 'Noomi', 'Rapace', 'okay', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'positively', 'godawful', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'poorly', 'misused', 'rest', 'crew', 'totally', 'throw-away', 'many', 'other', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'only', 'seem', 'exist', 'serve', 'plot', 'contrivances.So', 'positive', 'end', 'spectrum', 'have', 'greatest', 'jaw-dropping', 'thrilling', 'effects', 'work', 'years', 'taking', 'place', 'planet', 'light', 'years', 'earth', 'involving', 'Alien', 'technology', 'mutated', 'viruses', 'androids', 'other', 'end', 'are', 'weak', 'characters', 'gimmicky', 'plot', 'underdeveloped', 'metaphysical', 'theme', 'Not', 'first', 'time', 'Scott', 'first', 'film', 'said', 'everything', 'needed', 'be', 'said', 'only', 'had', 'hint', 'larger', 'more', 'frightening', 'aspects', 'material', 'biblical', 'allegories', 'are', 'place', 'here', 'just', 'look', 'what', 'saying', 'development', 'planet']",N/A

I wish I'd seen it in 3-D, but I was too eager to get the HD download to wait for the Blu-Ray (and I  missed it in theaters). There are some questionable casting decisions that bothered me, specifically casting Noomi Rapace as an English scientist named Emma Shaw, I think, when she's only been speaking English for about a year. It would have taken little more than a five minute search and replace function in the script to make her a Swedish scientist working in an international operation and then she might have spent less effort trying to get an accent right. She's a brilliant actress,(The Swedish Stiege Larson trilogy) and in the latter 45 minutes of the movie, when so much of the acting is physical, you can absolutely see why she was cast, but why they made her English seems like giving her an extra stone to carry when it wasn't necessary. Likewise Idris Alba, who is almost always terrific, and successfully played a Baltimore gangster for five years on The Wire without a hitch in the accent, is cast as, I guess, a Texan. He was credible, but there was no reason not to give him a Cockney or Northern English Accent if you needed him to be working class.(He plays the captain of the ship.)You don't care about any of that. It's a fun, flashy, sci-fi horror movie with first-rate actors. It's not quite as scary and atmospheric as Alien, but it's cool to look at. You'll be tempted to try to think too hard, and a lot of people who saw it said they found it confusing, but it does resolve and explain itself by the very end, so just sort of hang on for the ride and think, ""I'm watching a monster movie, not a philosophical treatise.""

Of course, an artificial mound still has those monstrous eggs to be discovered, some gnashing little embryos, a humanoid who'll surprise you (at least the actor who plays it will) and a secret that could spell the destruction of humankind.Scott and his writers give us an alien's (the Engineer) DNA in a beautiful, pompous and incomprehensible opening, a corrupt desire to prolong life, a father/daughter question, tentacles down a few throats and a nasty surprise clawing out of a chest. Plus an obvious set-up for Prometheus II. Scott combines self-aware ""messages"" and some taut scenes. The end of the movie brings the realization that, more than anything else, we paid good money to watch more overwrought computer special effects.What, ultimately, a yawn this movie is.

A boat load of excellent special effects, subtle to the eye Real 3-D and well blended audio surround track with punch are the highlights in this 2012 prequel ""Prometheus."" Based on the 1979 sci-fi smash, ""Alien,"" this prequel falls a little short of what movie goes have come to expect from legendary/visionary/director/producer, Ridley Scott. In this action pack yet cerebral shaker, Scott attempts to bridge mankind with the God's of Mythology while at the same time trying to end ""Prometheus"" where critical acclaimed award winning ""Alien"" begins. Considering Alien was released 32 year before Prometheus, I think it possible some people just won't get it. Yet for die hard fans of ""Alien,"" Ridley Scott does connect the dots but we have to assemble the pieces. Scott now 74 may not be making many more films at his age, so a ticket to see ""Prometheus"" is worth it, just to see the brillance of Scott at work.

It's pretty ****ing hard to believe this guy was involved with something like Alien or Blade Runner in particular. The latter film being one of the greatest films of all time in my book and Alien not far behind. This one.... well it certainly had the chance to be completely awesome and it just comes across like some high-budget made for TV film.WHY can they no get competent script writers and people to tell these guys this stuff resembles really weak storytelling and acting. As others have pointed out the incompetence of this high-tech culture is a little unbelievable and the situations they find themselves in are just a little too much to bear. It is well shot and the settings are very cool I just wish more talent and taste were put into the film. At the point one guy addresses an alien snake creature with, ""Hey baby, Hey baby,"" I almost had to call it quits. That is about all you need to know. I am willing to say at this point that Ridley's late brother's films are quite underrated, many of them with great scripts to be honest, compared to the blockbuster flicks the elder is putting out. I mean, you find an alien creature and the thing looks horrifying and is staring at you as it slithers up from a pool... and you sit there addressing it with that? Really? How about when the captain asks Charlize if she is a robot and then they go sleep together as she proves she is not one or something? WTF?Seriously, Roomi and the lead male are TOTALLY miscast. Just insane how bad they are this film. Pretty much ruins it for me. Your mileage may differ but Roomi is by far the worst here looking like someone totally different from the love interest the male would truly be into.

1475207,A10HIGTSU45VAI,B005LAIHXQ,CriticNic,"[1, 2]","Prometheus was one of my most anticipated films of the year. The mysterious Ridley Scott project showed promise of being a modern sci-fi masterpiece while at the same time building off of the world created by a classic sci-fi masterpiece (Alien). Now, I won't go on pretending to be an Alien expert, it's been years since I've seen the original film and science fiction isn't my typical go-to genre. However, I love a creative and imaginative sci-fi flick when I do watch them, and Prometheus seemed like it had everything I was looking for.Perhaps more importantly than the overall look and concept of the film, the initial reports of the film's cast had me intrigued long before I saw any images from the film itself. Noomi Rapace quickly became my favorite actress from her demanding performance in the Swedish The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and sequels. I've since sought out all her other work I could obtain in the States, and was only more in love. Her exposure in Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows was only a teaser for her U.S. film debut, the true test was her leading role as Elizabeth Shaw in the futuristic epic.Aside from Noomi, the rest of the cast would leave movie fans dying with excitement. The powerful Michael Fassbender and the always amazing Charlize Theron, along with a promising supporting cast offered much to look forward to. Needless to say, the film set its expectations fairly high, which usually always ends up in fan disappointment. But hype aside, I can honestly say I loved this film. I actually felt that my relative unfamiliarity with the Alien franchise gave me some benefit in enjoying the film, as I didn't put pressure on the film to live up to anything else. I took it in for what it was, and I think that's always the best thing to do when watching any movie.Aesthetically the world in the film is stunning. The barren wasteland of the far away planet our group of discoverers arrive on has a decrepit yet mystifying beauty to it. The space scenes are gorgeous as well, which are prime examples of how modern effects can be used efficiently. Then there are the ""Engineers,"" who are crafted with such beauty and eeriness. Every aspect of the film visually was spot on, which one can greatly appreciate when watching the Blu-ray. Visually speaking, the film is a work of art.But of course a film has to be more than eye candy. So does it truly deliver? The story for me was very interesting. Many questions are asked, and just as many left unanswered. Perhaps this is what frustrated some moviegoers, but that's something I can really appreciate about a film. Our main characters, doctors Shaw (Rapace) and Holloway (Marshall-Green) lead the voyage on which they seek answers to the origins of life. We're presented with images of ancient beings throughout the film, and our characters experience several events that only build up the questions and complexity in an otherwise straight-forward plot.One of the potential pitfalls the film fell victim was its urge to cut to the chase. After watching the Blu-ray, I dove into some of the special features. The commentary on several deleted scenes revealed while certain scenes were cut. These cut scenes added more dimension to the characters, made them seem more real and made us feel more connected to them. They were cut more or less to save time. This is the one aspect I felt held the film down. The mentally intriguing story, astounding visuals and superb cast were the building blocks for a truly amazing film. This is one of those films that could easily be near 3 hours long, and I wouldn't complain (such as with the Harry Potter films). That extra time dedicated to building on the characters gives the film that humanity that makes it more of an emotional experience than a titillating thrill ride.Putting that one aspect aside, this film was fantastic. Whenever a film comes with a huge hype surrounding it, it's bound to let many down. It's tough to avoid the advertisements, articles and gossip about blockbusters like this, but the effort to do so pays off in terms of enjoying the movie. I loved Prometheus, and it really left me wanting more. I just hope for a possible extended, uncut version, and potentially even better, a sequel that can be as good as the original while making up for what this film left out.Source: criticnic.com 5 December 2012",4,"Missing something, but still fantastic",1356652800,"12 28, 2012",2012,4358,"['Prometheus', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'anticipated', 'films', 'year', 'mysterious', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'project', 'showed', 'promise', 'being', 'modern', 'sci-fi', 'masterpiece', 'same', 'time', 'building', 'world', 'created', 'classic', 'sci-fi', 'masterpiece', 'Alien', 'Now', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'pretending', 'be', 'Alien', 'expert', 'been', 'years', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'original', 'film', 'science', 'fiction', ""n't"", 'typical', 'go-to', 'genre', 'However', 'love', 'creative', 'imaginative', 'sci-fi', 'flick', 'when', 'do', 'watch', 'Prometheus', 'seemed', 'had', 'everything', 'was', 'looking', 'for.Perhaps', 'more', 'importantly', 'overall', 'look', 'concept', 'film', 'initial', 'reports', 'film', 'cast', 'had', 'intrigued', 'long', 'saw', 'images', 'film', 'Noomi', 'Rapace', 'quickly', 'became', 'favorite', 'actress', 'demanding', 'performance', 'Swedish', 'Girl', 'Dragon', 'Tattoo', 'sequels', ""'ve"", 'sought', 'out', 'other', 'work', 'could', 'obtain', 'States', 'was', 'only', 'more', 'love', 'exposure', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'Game', 'Shadows', 'was', 'only', 'teaser', 'U.S.', 'film', 'debut', 'true', 'test', 'was', 'leading', 'role', 'Elizabeth', 'Shaw', 'futuristic', 'epic.Aside', 'Noomi', 'rest', 'cast', 'would', 'leave', 'movie', 'fans', 'dying', 'excitement', 'powerful', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'always', 'amazing', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'promising', 'supporting', 'cast', 'offered', 'much', 'look', 'forward', 'Needless', 'say', 'film', 'set', 'expectations', 'fairly', 'high', 'usually', 'always', 'up', 'fan', 'disappointment', 'hype', 'aside', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'loved', 'film', 'actually', 'felt', 'relative', 'unfamiliarity', 'Alien', 'franchise', 'gave', 'benefit', 'enjoying', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'put', 'pressure', 'film', 'live', 'up', 'anything', 'else', 'took', 'what', 'was', 'think', 'always', 'best', 'thing', 'do', 'when', 'watching', 'movie.Aesthetically', 'world', 'film', 'stunning', 'barren', 'wasteland', 'far', 'away', 'planet', 'group', 'discoverers', 'arrive', 'decrepit', 'yet', 'mystifying', 'beauty', 'space', 'scenes', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'well', 'are', 'prime', 'examples', 'how', 'modern', 'effects', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'efficiently', 'Then', 'are', 'Engineers', 'who', 'are', 'crafted', 'such', 'beauty', 'eeriness', 'aspect', 'film', 'visually', 'was', 'spot', 'one', 'can', 'greatly', 'appreciate', 'when', 'watching', 'Blu-ray', 'Visually', 'speaking', 'film', 'work', 'art.But', 'course', 'film', 'be', 'more', 'eye', 'candy', 'So', 'truly', 'deliver', 'story', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'Many', 'questions', 'are', 'asked', 'just', 'many', 'left', 'unanswered', 'Perhaps', 'frustrated', 'moviegoers', 'something', 'can', 'really', 'appreciate', 'film', 'main', 'characters', 'doctors', 'Shaw', 'Rapace', 'Holloway', 'Marshall-Green', 'lead', 'voyage', 'seek', 'answers', 'origins', 'life', ""'re"", 'presented', 'images', 'ancient', 'beings', 'film', 'characters', 'experience', 'several', 'events', 'only', 'build', 'up', 'questions', 'complexity', 'otherwise', 'straight-forward', 'plot.One', 'potential', 'pitfalls', 'film', 'fell', 'victim', 'was', 'urge', 'cut', 'chase', 'watching', 'Blu-ray', 'dove', 'special', 'features', 'commentary', 'several', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'revealed', 'certain', 'scenes', 'were', 'cut', 'cut', 'added', 'more', 'dimension', 'characters', 'made', 'seem', 'more', 'real', 'made', 'feel', 'more', 'connected', 'were', 'cut', 'more', 'less', 'save', 'time', 'one', 'aspect', 'felt', 'held', 'film', 'down', 'mentally', 'intriguing', 'story', 'astounding', 'visuals', 'superb', 'cast', 'were', 'building', 'blocks', 'truly', 'amazing', 'film', 'one', 'films', 'could', 'easily', 'be', '3', 'hours', 'long', 'would', ""n't"", 'complain', 'such', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'films', 'extra', 'time', 'dedicated', 'building', 'characters', 'film', 'humanity', 'more', 'emotional', 'experience', 'titillating', 'thrill', 'ride.Putting', 'one', 'aspect', 'aside', 'film', 'was', 'fantastic', 'Whenever', 'film', 'huge', 'hype', 'surrounding', 'bound', 'let', 'many', 'down', 'tough', 'avoid', 'advertisements', 'articles', 'gossip', 'blockbusters', 'effort', 'do', 'so', 'pays', 'off', 'terms', 'enjoying', 'movie', 'loved', 'Prometheus', 'really', 'left', 'wanting', 'more', 'just', 'hope', 'possible', 'extended', 'uncut', 'version', 'potentially', 'even', 'better', 'sequel', 'can', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'making', 'up', 'what', 'film', 'left', 'out.Source', 'criticnic.com', '5', 'December', '2012']",N/A

The CGI is plentiful, as one comes to expect with modern cinema (especially in the scifi/fantasy genre) but it is used with great artistry and panache.The story is, given the circumstances, original enough and the panspermia origins idea has an interesting modern resonance that will delight or annoy. Much is left unsaid, allowing the audience to draw their own conclusions (whilst simultaneously paving the way for a sequel), although the story is somewhat confusing, making a second or third watching essential. The details do let the film down a little though and my guess is that amateur biologists will have many a bone to pick with the film's writer. It has already been noted that some of the other details are a little off kilter (to be generous), for instance spending a trillion dollars on such a huge space mission and then manning it with a bunch of (let's be honest) incomptetent amateurs just doesn't make sense.The acting is... adequate. Wheras Scott managed to crew the Nostromo with some excellent performers (I'm thinking of Veronica Cartwright, Harry Dean Stanton and Ian Holm), the best he can do here is Charlize Theron and Noomi Rapace, neither of whom will win the film any Oscars, I'm afraid. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing particularly egregious going on here, but neither are there any stand-out performances. OK, perhaps I'm being a little unfair: Fassbender's depiction of the android David is rather tasty, but I would say that he steals the film, highlighting the ordinariness of his co-actors rather than lifting their performances.My main complaint is that Scott, despite his protestations that Prometheus is NOT a prequel to Alien, has simply warmed over many of the themes, images and ideas that he adressed in that film. The decor and external design of the ship Prometheus looks suspiciously Nostromo-esque, David plays an almost identical role to Ash (and eventually meets a very similar end) and the film explores the same rape and childbirth-horror themes as did the original film. The life-raft? The flamethrowers? The xenomorph eggs/DNA jars? Which film was I watching? I would even go so far as to suggest that the film draws very heavily on the second of the sequence ""Aliens"". Of course Scott wanted to maintain coherence and consistency across the canon but I think he may have gone too far and it simply looks like he picked out the best bits of Alien and had another go at them with Prometheus.Well, there you go. On balance, this is an excellent scifi thriller and I have no hesitation in recommending it: the story tickles, tempts and teases and there's sufficient tentacle madness to please the hoariest xenomorph hunter. Although it's let down by some unimaginitive writing and not helped by some uninspired acting, it stands it's ground manfully, looks good enough to eat and has great rewatch potential.Oh yes, and you get to see Ms Theron and Ms Rapace in their scanties.

1475212,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B005LAIHXQ,C. Sawin,"[12, 24]","This film is absolutely gorgeous from beginning to end. The ""beginning of time"" montage that starts the film is beautiful; roaming shots of the Icelandic countryside and angry waterfalls wash over you as the score tries to soothe you in a way that feels like it's trying to mislead you. It's as if it's trying to say, ""There there, it'll be alright,"" and pats you softly on the hand like a caring grandmother before turning around in the next scene and growing to its peak as something horrific takes place on screen that wasn't expected mere moments ago.Everything is awe-inspiring to look at. One of the reasons for that is that Scott tried to use as little CGI in the film as possible (although there are over 1300 digital VFX shots) and mostly stuck to computer generated shots being used in space. If you're not blown away by the scenery, their exploration of the planet's surface and what that leads to, or the incredible shots in space, the technology they use in the film is beyond astounding; Reacting with holograms, 3D maps that can be accessed with the swipe of a finger, and an android capable of doing things some people only dream of is only scratching the surface.Where do we come from? Who are our makers? Will we still trust our faith when we find the answers? These are the questions ""Prometheus"" explores in its story. You also have a pretty great idea of just what the heck a Space Jockey is by the time ""Prometheus"" ends. The thing is that if you go into this expecting a straight shooting ""Alien"" prequel, you'll more than likely be disappointed. There are definitely nods to it and parts of the film play out similarly to ""Alien,"" but this is more like taking place in the same universe as ""Alien"" and more of an indirect prequel. That quote Ridley Scott gave about this ""having 'Alien' DNA,"" is extremely accurate.""Prometheus"" isn't perfect. It may be really slow moving for some. It takes its sweet time establishing its atmosphere and you may be left wanting a bit more action. Patient viewers who can sit still and admire dialogue and a solid story will be rewarded while trigger happy viewers will more than likely get antsy. The ending, although somewhat satisfying, is mostly just this huge tease. If a sequel isn't made, we should probably riot; although, with repeat viewings, it's less of a problem.The biggest issue people may have is that technology seems so much more advanced in the past than in the future. ""Prometheus"" mostly takes place in 2093 while ""Alien"" takes place in 2122. You also have to keep in mind that the Prometheus is a more advanced ship than the Nostromo, a towing vessel; more of a grunt ship. So the argument could go either way.Repeat viewings also leave you with more questions. The main one being why did the atmosphere have such an altering affect on the ampule room yet didn't affect the cargo hold at all?""Prometheus"" is really freaking superb on one hand. Its cast is ridiculous and every one of them delivers, the visuals are fantastic, and the storyline is mostly incredibly enthralling. Imagine being a film critic who's used to taking notes throughout the duration of a film, but during ""Prometheus"" you were so absorbed in it that you didn't write anything down other than the title. That's kind of a big deal.On the other hand, something more definitive seems like it would have been more gratifying. With stakes so high that define what we, as humans, actually are, an open ending leaving room for a sequel feels like a bit of a cop out. ""Prometheus"" is still spectacular and mesmerizing. Ridley Scott is back in top form, but ""Prometheus"" suffers from pulling (and relying on) the strings of anticipation a bit too much.",5,Embrace the return of exceptional sci-fi,1339113600,"06 8, 2012",2012,3695,"['film', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'beginning', 'end', 'beginning', 'time', 'montage', 'film', 'beautiful', 'roaming', 'shots', 'Icelandic', 'countryside', 'angry', 'waterfalls', 'wash', 'over', 'score', 'tries', 'soothe', 'way', 'feels', 'trying', 'mislead', 'trying', 'say', 'there', ""'ll"", 'be', 'alright', 'pats', 'softly', 'hand', 'caring', 'grandmother', 'turning', 'around', 'next', 'scene', 'growing', 'peak', 'something', 'horrific', 'place', 'screen', 'was', ""n't"", 'expected', 'mere', 'moments', 'ago.Everything', 'awe-inspiring', 'look', 'One', 'reasons', 'Scott', 'tried', 'use', 'little', 'CGI', 'film', 'possible', 'are', '1300', 'digital', 'VFX', 'shots', 'mostly', 'stuck', 'computer', 'generated', 'shots', 'being', 'used', 'space', ""'re"", 'not', 'blown', 'away', 'scenery', 'exploration', 'planet', 'surface', 'what', 'incredible', 'shots', 'space', 'technology', 'use', 'film', 'astounding', 'Reacting', 'holograms', '3D', 'maps', 'can', 'be', 'accessed', 'swipe', 'finger', 'android', 'capable', 'doing', 'things', 'people', 'only', 'dream', 'only', 'scratching', 'surface.Where', 'do', 'come', 'Who', 'are', 'makers', 'Will', 'still', 'trust', 'faith', 'when', 'find', 'answers', 'are', 'questions', 'Prometheus', 'story', 'also', 'have', 'pretty', 'great', 'idea', 'just', 'what', 'heck', 'Space', 'Jockey', 'time', 'Prometheus', 'thing', 'go', 'expecting', 'straight', 'shooting', 'Alien', 'prequel', ""'ll"", 'more', 'likely', 'be', 'disappointed', 'are', 'definitely', 'nods', 'parts', 'film', 'play', 'out', 'similarly', 'Alien', 'more', 'taking', 'place', 'same', 'universe', 'Alien', 'more', 'indirect', 'prequel', 'quote', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'gave', 'having', ""'Alien"", 'DNA', 'extremely', 'accurate', 'Prometheus', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'may', 'be', 'really', 'slow', 'moving', 'sweet', 'time', 'establishing', 'atmosphere', 'may', 'be', 'left', 'wanting', 'bit', 'more', 'action', 'Patient', 'viewers', 'who', 'can', 'sit', 'still', 'admire', 'dialogue', 'solid', 'story', 'will', 'be', 'rewarded', 'trigger', 'happy', 'viewers', 'will', 'more', 'likely', 'get', 'antsy', 'ending', 'somewhat', 'satisfying', 'mostly', 'just', 'huge', 'tease', 'sequel', ""n't"", 'made', 'should', 'probably', 'riot', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'less', 'problem.The', 'biggest', 'issue', 'people', 'may', 'have', 'technology', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'advanced', 'past', 'future', 'Prometheus', 'mostly', 'place', '2093', 'Alien', 'place', '2122', 'also', 'have', 'keep', 'mind', 'Prometheus', 'more', 'advanced', 'ship', 'Nostromo', 'towing', 'vessel', 'more', 'grunt', 'ship', 'argument', 'could', 'go', 'either', 'way.Repeat', 'viewings', 'also', 'leave', 'more', 'questions', 'main', 'one', 'being', 'why', 'did', 'atmosphere', 'have', 'altering', 'affect', 'ampule', 'room', 'yet', 'did', ""n't"", 'affect', 'cargo', 'hold', 'Prometheus', 'really', 'freaking', 'superb', 'one', 'hand', 'cast', 'ridiculous', 'one', 'delivers', 'visuals', 'are', 'fantastic', 'storyline', 'mostly', 'incredibly', 'enthralling', 'Imagine', 'being', 'film', 'critic', 'who', 'used', 'taking', 'notes', 'duration', 'film', 'Prometheus', 'were', 'so', 'absorbed', 'did', ""n't"", 'write', 'anything', 'down', 'other', 'title', 'kind', 'big', 'deal.On', 'other', 'hand', 'something', 'more', 'definitive', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'gratifying', 'stakes', 'so', 'high', 'define', 'what', 'humans', 'actually', 'are', 'open', 'ending', 'leaving', 'room', 'sequel', 'feels', 'bit', 'cop', 'out', 'Prometheus', 'still', 'spectacular', 'mesmerizing', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'back', 'top', 'form', 'Prometheus', 'suffers', 'pulling', 'relying', 'strings', 'anticipation', 'bit', 'too', 'much']",N/A
1475213,A2RLK9KKVGEETZ,B005LAIHXQ,"C. Tsao ""Seaview1""","[10, 17]","It has been over thirty years since director Ridley Scott (Gladiator, Black Hawk Down) made two highly influential, game-changing science fiction films, Alien and Blade Runner.  Now he revisits his earliest triumph, Alien, not as a sequel but as a kind of prequel that has threads connecting both films.  An intelligent science fiction film with elements of horror, Prometheus embraces bold concepts of human origin and its creation by `ancient astronauts'.  The film is not quite a classic, but should thoroughly satisfy purists and general moviegoers alike.An archeological couple has pieced together remarkable clues from early human drawings revealing a stellar map that may lead to the source of mankind.  The couple, Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green), join a crew and its Captain Janek (Idris Elba) on a two year mission to a mysterious planet aboard the spaceship Prometheus.  Financed by the Weyland Corporation and represented by Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron), the only non-human on board is an android named David (Michael Fassbender).  Prometheus lands near some structures which, upon investigation, reveal evidence of life, but the discovery has startling implications leading to a desperate struggle for survival that threatens the earth.The film is not without some surprises and plot twists, and without giving too much away, Scott likes to end his films with an ambiguous sense of hope.  There are some unanswered questions, however, and there is one glaring injustice that gets lost amid the film's fascinating conclusion.  One pivotal, incredible scene involves a remarkable, graphic emergency surgery that strains the limits of credibility, but nevertheless holds the viewers' agonized attention.The story has a compelling setup and when the crew goes inside the structure, they discover a series of chambers that takes the journey closer to potential answers or deadly threat.  It's like the ultimate funhouse of terrors.  It's also a safe bet that nasty things happen when curious humans meet invasive, alien life forms.Having to live up to its predecessor, Prometheus builds its own fascinating world and broadens storyline implications for future films. It's not Alien, whose novelty and groundbreaking creature designs stunned audiences, but there are certainly enough connections to draw parallels between the two films. Alien is referenced in several ways including bits of dialogue, a sampling of Jerry Goldsmith's original theme, and culminating with markedly familiar set pieces.  (Ironically Alien itself was a big budget reworking of a B-movie, It the Terror from Beyond Space.)The film does feel a bit derivative at times and borrows liberally from other science fiction classics.  The early scenes where David is the only conscious crew member who wiles away his solitary existence with basketball, watching holographic dreams of the hibernating crew, and admiring Lawrence of Arabia, harken back to the Discovery crew of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey.  Some scenes are not original as they seem lifted right out of Alien vs. Predator, Leviathan and various episodes of TV's The X Files.Fassbender, who shines in the film, does a very convincing job imbuing his android with almost human characteristics and a potentially sinister side.  Think of 2001's disembodied computer HAL and you get the idea.  Strong female leads are a staple of Scott's films (Thelma and Louise), and Rapace is a strong female heroine whose faith is sorely tested amid personal loss and her obsessive hunt for the truth about mankind's beginnings.Cinematography has always been a strong point in Scott's films, and the film's stunning visuals display the planet's otherworldly beauty.  The production design is imaginative particularly inside the structure with its myriad of biomechanical architecture and impressive special effects.  Swiss artist H. R. Giger, who designed the original Alien monster, contributes a bit of reverse engineering that fans will appreciate.Prometheus is a thought provoking adventure that not only can stand on its own, but rises tall among most science fiction films.  It's a visually impressive epic with an ambitious agenda that doesn't completely work, but even so, this antecedent to Alien is a worthy bookend to the series.",4,The Testament of PROMETHEUS,1340668800,"06 26, 2012",2012,4324,"['been', 'thirty', 'years', 'director', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'Gladiator', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'made', 'two', 'highly', 'influential', 'game-changing', 'science', 'fiction', 'films', 'Alien', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'Now', 'earliest', 'triumph', 'Alien', 'not', 'sequel', 'kind', 'prequel', 'threads', 'connecting', 'films', 'intelligent', 'science', 'fiction', 'film', 'elements', 'horror', 'Prometheus', 'bold', 'concepts', 'human', 'origin', 'creation', 'ancient', 'astronauts', 'film', 'not', 'quite', 'classic', 'should', 'thoroughly', 'satisfy', 'purists', 'general', 'moviegoers', 'alike.An', 'archeological', 'couple', 'pieced', 'together', 'remarkable', 'clues', 'early', 'human', 'drawings', 'revealing', 'stellar', 'map', 'may', 'lead', 'source', 'mankind', 'couple', 'Elizabeth', 'Shaw', 'Noomi', 'Rapace', 'Charlie', 'Holloway', 'Logan', 'Marshall-Green', 'join', 'crew', 'Captain', 'Janek', 'Idris', 'Elba', 'two', 'year', 'mission', 'mysterious', 'planet', 'spaceship', 'Prometheus', 'Financed', 'Weyland', 'Corporation', 'represented', 'Meredith', 'Vickers', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'only', 'non-human', 'board', 'android', 'named', 'David', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'Prometheus', 'structures', 'investigation', 'reveal', 'evidence', 'life', 'discovery', 'startling', 'implications', 'leading', 'desperate', 'struggle', 'survival', 'earth.The', 'film', 'not', 'surprises', 'plot', 'twists', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'Scott', 'end', 'films', 'ambiguous', 'sense', 'hope', 'are', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'however', 'one', 'glaring', 'injustice', 'lost', 'film', 'fascinating', 'conclusion', 'One', 'pivotal', 'incredible', 'scene', 'remarkable', 'graphic', 'emergency', 'surgery', 'limits', 'credibility', 'nevertheless', 'viewers', 'agonized', 'attention.The', 'story', 'compelling', 'setup', 'when', 'crew', 'structure', 'discover', 'series', 'chambers', 'journey', 'closer', 'potential', 'answers', 'deadly', 'threat', 'ultimate', 'funhouse', 'terrors', 'also', 'safe', 'bet', 'nasty', 'things', 'happen', 'when', 'curious', 'humans', 'meet', 'invasive', 'alien', 'life', 'forms.Having', 'live', 'up', 'predecessor', 'Prometheus', 'own', 'fascinating', 'world', 'broadens', 'storyline', 'implications', 'future', 'films', 'not', 'Alien', 'novelty', 'groundbreaking', 'creature', 'designs', 'stunned', 'audiences', 'are', 'certainly', 'enough', 'connections', 'draw', 'parallels', 'two', 'films', 'Alien', 'referenced', 'several', 'ways', 'including', 'bits', 'dialogue', 'sampling', 'Jerry', 'Goldsmith', 'original', 'theme', 'culminating', 'markedly', 'familiar', 'set', 'pieces', 'Ironically', 'Alien', 'was', 'big', 'budget', 'reworking', 'B-movie', 'Terror', 'Beyond', 'Space', 'film', 'feel', 'bit', 'derivative', 'times', 'borrows', 'liberally', 'other', 'science', 'fiction', 'classics', 'early', 'scenes', 'where', 'David', 'only', 'conscious', 'crew', 'member', 'who', 'away', 'solitary', 'existence', 'basketball', 'watching', 'holographic', 'dreams', 'hibernating', 'crew', 'admiring', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'harken', 'back', 'Discovery', 'crew', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', '2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'original', 'seem', 'lifted', 'right', 'Alien', 'vs', 'Predator', 'Leviathan', 'various', 'episodes', 'TV', 'X', 'Files.Fassbender', 'who', 'film', 'very', 'convincing', 'job', 'imbuing', 'android', 'almost', 'human', 'characteristics', 'potentially', 'sinister', 'side', 'Think', '2001', 'disembodied', 'computer', 'HAL', 'get', 'idea', 'Strong', 'female', 'leads', 'are', 'staple', 'Scott', 'films', 'Thelma', 'Louise', 'Rapace', 'strong', 'female', 'heroine', 'faith', 'sorely', 'tested', 'personal', 'loss', 'obsessive', 'hunt', 'truth', 'mankind', 'beginnings.Cinematography', 'always', 'been', 'strong', 'point', 'Scott', 'films', 'film', 'stunning', 'visuals', 'display', 'planet', 'otherworldly', 'beauty', 'production', 'design', 'imaginative', 'particularly', 'structure', 'myriad', 'biomechanical', 'architecture', 'impressive', 'special', 'effects', 'Swiss', 'artist', 'H.', 'R.', 'Giger', 'who', 'designed', 'original', 'Alien', 'monster', 'bit', 'reverse', 'engineering', 'fans', 'will', 'appreciate.Prometheus', 'thought', 'provoking', 'adventure', 'not', 'only', 'can', 'stand', 'own', 'tall', 'most', 'science', 'fiction', 'films', 'visually', 'impressive', 'epic', 'ambitious', 'agenda', ""n't"", 'completely', 'work', 'even', 'so', 'antecedent', 'Alien', 'worthy', 'bookend', 'series']",N/A

Sure there's some stuff that defies logic, they do jump into things hastily especially considering they landed on a new and hostile planet, but it puts you into a world like no other and leaves you wanting to see what's next. And it raises questions we're all interested in even outside the context of the film - about things like faith, our origins, and artificial intelligence. ""Why do you hate us!"" is a line that resonates strongly.

Why not just YouTube yourself while riding a go-cart for 2 hours and yelling ""Weeeeeee!"" at the top of your lungs at certain intervals to keep us entertained.Using the 2 scientists who were fatally attacked by the alien white snakes was actually supposed to be ""comic relief"" according to the director.

A Blu-ray release will be a definite must because the cinematography was superb in this movie. The alien world and ship(s) settings are remarkably beautiful and felt real. The acting was top notch with kudos to Michael Fassbender being the most memorable. The beautiful Noomi Rapace and seriousness of Charlize Theron also helped push Prometheus narrative as well. Of course, the hate comments I read after this movie was released make it not perfect, as usual:""this is not a direct Alien sequel, but only based in the universe."" Duh, we knew this from the beginning, Why is this hump hard to get over, dumb metacritic reviewer?Scientific fact nerds will be nit picky... even though we know it's a sci-fi film. Do we really need to point out every great sci-fi films problems? The movie is set in the future and on out of this world ideas.  Just Go with it!The story was cliched and predictable, even though, wait, why are these guys lost? Okay that doesn't make sense, but oh well.My biggest problem and the only constructive argument that I agreed on was, what exactly does the main plot device actually do? In Alien, the xenomorph monster was easy to understand. In Prometheus, Ridley Scott and writers loaded the black goo monster mechanic into a plot shotgun and shot the effects everywhere making it hard to figure out what exactly is the menace here. So Scott's films of the past, it seems that a need for a director's cut is in need.So with that in mind, this may not be THE copy of Prometheus to own at the time. However, I still liked what I watched and I beleive that of all the movies releases lately with a director's commentary, this may be the one if you are seeking possible answers to questions of the film.. It did suck me back into the Weyland/Utani cooperate future of the Alien universe.

I find it even more surprising that throughout the entire movie, very little hint is given that the movie is actually a prequel to the Aliens movie other than indirect evidences. I'm not sure of the reason for this. Whether it's because of the fact that they can't say it belongs to Alien franchise (due to copyrights or whatever) or they don't want new audience viewers (Alien franchise is about 30 years old I think) to be misrepresented. Whatever the reason, the ""A word"" (known as Alien) is never mentioned anywhere in the film and not a single description was given that indicates it was part of the Alien world other than Ridley Scott directed it and that he directed Alien.The movie itself is rather good. At the start, we learn that Weyland Yutani, the evil  faceless company from the Aliens movie, is spearheading a research vessel to reach a planet in a far off world in space. A surprising fact about Weyland is that it was never mentioned in the first Alien movie which was directed by Ridley Scott, so I was a bit surprised that he actually decided to use this name.The reason for the space vessel is noble. Throughout earth, it appears there are many clues to point to a system of stars that isn't visible by the naked eye that many ancient cultures drew. It pinpoints that somehow an alien visitor must have told them about these star systems. So Weyland decided to build a ship, hire these scientists, and attempt to make contact with this far off world not knowing if anything is there or if they'll make it back.The movie tries to make battle between a lot of things and I think at some point it sort of falls apart. The first attempt is to try and settle the argument between science and religion. Throughout the movie, the main theme is to find the origins of earth life through these ancient aliens the characters refer to as the ""creators."" The main character Elizabeth has a cross that she got from her father who died when she was young. Her mother also died early. So Elizabeth is left without family and on top of that, as a cruel joke, Elizabeth also can't have children so she's doomed to always try and find the answer to life yet at the same time she'll never be able to pass the knowledge. So with this in mind, Elizabeth is at great conflicts, she wants to find answers but she also wants to believe that there is something more than just this physical world. Many other characters try to battle this out with Elizabeth and try to say, ""Why do you believe in god and yet know that these 'creators' are indeed your god?"" And Elizabeth answer is, ""What created the creator?"" That is the entire basis of it and it's corny as anything.The movie itself taken a very different turn from the Aliens universe. The aliens movies, at least the first two, were about discovering a new life form that happens to be hostile. It was aimed at scaring people and on top of that produce a great movie about battling aliens and surviving. The movie Prometheus was suppose to be a prequel to explain where the aliens originated from. In the first Alien film, when the crew landed on LV426 discovered a crashed alien ship infested with what appears to be egg capsules and the lone humanoid pilot (that is much larger than a normal person) appearing to suffer a massive explosion from inside his abdomen. So the question by many fans was where did the ship come from? Who was in the ship? And that was what this movie, Prometheus was supposedly suppose to answer.So how did this film compare to the Aliens world? Does it answer the question that everyone had after watching the first Alien movie? The answer is no, in my opinion. The movie tries to make it that these ""creators"" created some biological weapon against humans. The star map that the creators told the humans was actually a biological weapon storage planet that house some biological weapon that can destroy humans and on top of that evolve to any shape and form. It turns out that the ship in the first Alien movie was actually a biological weapons vessel that house very dangerous weapons. So the movie begs more questions than answers. Why the creators decide to give humans a starmap to their destruction? Could they be upset that their creation can travel space? Or what if the creators never actually created life on earth and just gave the starmap in case life ever evolved too far? It doesn't make sense and I think this film Prometheus is indeed a prequel to another film.Overall I didn't like it. To say the aliens were actually evolved biological weapons might fit into the aliens world since in both films the ""company"" (aka Weyland Yutani) was interested in the Aliens for biological weapons. It appears in the first film, the company actually knew about the alien vessel and wanted to have it at all cost knowing that a hostile life form was on it but gave little explanation. So it was almost like the company was searching for that and never really knew where the planet Prometheus went to (or maybe it was destroyed which might be explained in Prometheus 2).Whatever it is, the movie was rather interesting but it fell apart in some areas. I found it to be a very visually pleasing movie. Elizabeth Shaw was a very fitting character for the film. There were some silly parts of the film but as a whole, the movie is okay and I liked it. I recommend to all Aliens fans out there.",4,Can't say the A word,1352937600,"11 15, 2012",2012,5516,"['was', 'bit', 'surprised', 'lot', 'folks', 'who', 'watched', 'preview', 'movie', 'were',

1475237,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B005LAIHXQ,DanD,"[6, 10]","Let's get this straight: PROMETHEUS is a polarizing film for many reasons.  I personally have yet to truly make up my mind about it.  Do I think it's an epically-drawn sci-fi piece, or an ego-driven effort into heady ideas and special effects?  I can't tell you.  Probably because, truthfully, it's both.The plot begins simply enough: a pair of scientists discover ancient cave drawings that they feel point toward a distant planet.  This planet may or may not hold the secret to life on Earth.  The scientists gain funding, a crew, and a spaceship, and head toward said planet.  Bad things happen when they get there.  Very bad things.There's a lot of good to be said in PROMETHEUS's favor.  The acting is solid; mainstays Charlize Theron, Noomie Rapace, Guy Pearce, and Logan Marshall-Green deliver solid, if not altogether memorable, performances.  Idris Elba is a standout in his supporting role.  Undoubtedly the best thing to be said about the film, everything else aside, is Michael Fassbender's performance as the LAWRENCE OF ARABIA-loving android David.  Fassbender has Peter O'Toole down pat, quoting him left and right in a near-perfect imitation, while keeping his character ambiguous and vaguely threatening (think Lance Henriksen's Bishop, but British).  Fassbender possibly deserves an Oscar nom for this one...but then, he usually does.Other good things: cinematography, special effects, overall ideology.  This film was a labor of love, and it truly shows.  There are some shocking scenes; there are some funny scenes; there are some touching and haunting scenes.  Bad thing: these scenes don't necessarily congeal.  Or maybe they do.  It depends if you buy into the overall goal of the movie, the point that it either makes or doesn't make (depending on how close attention you pay to details and plot holes).  The script is decidedly lackluster; it's bland and cliched, especially in dialogue.  Where the film excels is ideas.  The question is whether those ideas are carried out effectively.MILD SPOILERS MAY FOLLOW (though I give nothing away that I didn't know going into the film; if you are overly cautious, skip to the final paragraph).Here's the thing: PROMETHEUS tries to do too much.  It's a sci-fi adventure film; it's a borderline-theology piece; it's needlessly a part of the ALIEN universe (as though director Ridley Scott forced his writers to add that in there); it's a commentary on the human desire to know everything, and the consequences that come with such knowledge.  It is all of these things separately; it is rarely all of these things together.  There are many great ideas buried at the core of PROMETHEUS; Scott and company mine deep enough to give us a glimpse of most of these, but rarely go far enough to fully dig them out of the ground.Ultimately, whether you enjoy PROMETHEUS is based on your ability to suspend disbelief, open your mind, and marvel in what is otherwise a solid B-movie with A-list special effects and talent behind it.  If you can't do that, don't fret--PROMETHEUS doesn't work hard to make you to believe.  Instead, it bombards you with ideas.  It's supposedly the first of three films, so hopefully the second entry will settle all of the unanswered questions, and perhaps explain many of the plot holes.

As a matter of disclosure, Alien is a film I have watched more than any other, starting in my high school years with a long run at a local drive-in visited just about every weekend.  Alien set the tone for everything that followed.  And also as a matter of disclosure, force ranking the Alien series, from best to less than best:  Alien, Aliens, Resurrection, and Alien 3.  I know why people might put Aliens in front of Alien, but that is another discussion.So where does Prometheus fall in this continuum?  At this point, I have probably watched Prometheus more than 20 times.  The first viewing in the theater and in 3D left me wanting more and a bit perplexed.  After watching it multiple times on cable, I think it is well made, answers lots of questions, and provides a great base for further films.  For me it falls right in behind Aliens as slightly better than Resurrection for various reasons (although the actors picked for Resurrection were stellar).  For this review I am not going to get into plot lines, holes, acting, or really anything that has been covered ad nauseum by other reviewers.  You either like Prometheus or you don't.What I wanted to say is that the Blu-ray 3D version is a great transfer, and while not quite the big screen theater experience, the 3D effects are wonderous in places.  Moving to about 4 feet in front of a 65"" plasma, things start popping.  The formation of life in the opening sequence is just an opening salvo. The initial presentation with the projection cube on the ""why are we here"" mission briefing makes you seem like you are right there in the room.  The 3D model on Prometheus' bridge of the mapped alien complex really comes forward.  And then there is David standing in the middle of the alien navigation diagram, still as exciting as it was in the theater. This version of the film is well worth it if you can view it properly, and there is enough 3D to keep your interest without being over the top.3D is seemingly on its way out on the broadcast side, but let's hope that it is not dead as a format to be experienced in theaters or on disks like Prometheus.  5/5 for the 3D transfer and effects, 5/5 for the Amazon price (cheap!), 4/5 for being potentially confusing without multiple views, and 4/5 cus it is not Alien or Aliens!",4,3D worth it,1389571200,"01 13, 2014",2014,2373,"['Prometheus', 'prequel', 'Alien', 'was', 'destined', 'be', 'loved', 'hated', 'viewers', 'matter', 'disclosure', 'Alien', 'film', 'have', 'watched', 'more', 'other', 'starting', 'high', 'school', 'years', 'long', 'run', 'local', 'drive-in', 'visited', 'just', 'weekend', 'Alien', 'set', 'tone', 'everything', 'followed', 'also', 'matter', 'disclosure', 'force', 'ranking', 'Alien', 'series', 'best', 'less', 'best', 'Alien', 'Aliens', 'Resurrection', 'Alien', '3', 'know', 'why', 'people', 'might', 'put', 'Aliens', 'front', 'Alien', 'discussion.So', 'where', 'Prometheus', 'fall', 'continuum', 'point', 'have', 'probably', 'watched', 'Prometheus', 'more', '20', 'times', 'first', 'viewing', 'theater', '3D', 'left', 'wanting', 'more', 'bit', 'perplexed', 'watching', 'multiple', 'times', 'cable', 'think', 'well', 'made', 'answers', 'lots', 'questions', 'great', 'base', 'further', 'films', 'right', 'behind', 'Aliens', 'slightly', 'better', 'Resurrection', 'various', 'reasons', 'actors', 'picked', 'Resurrection', 'were', 'stellar', 'review', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'get', 'plot', 'lines', 'holes', 'acting', 'really', 'anything', 'been', 'covered', 'ad', 'nauseum', 'other', 'reviewers', 'either', 'Prometheus', ""don't.What"", 'wanted', 'say', 'Blu-ray', '3D', 'version', 'great', 'transfer', 'not', 'big', 'screen', 'theater', 'experience', '3D', 'effects', 'are', 'wonderous', 'places', 'Moving', '4', 'feet', 'front', '65', 'plasma', 'things', 'start', 'popping', 'formation', 'life', 'opening', 'sequence', 'just', 'opening', 'salvo', 'initial', 'presentation', 'projection', 'cube', 'why', 'are', 'here', 'mission', 'briefing', 'seem', 'are', 'right', 'there', 'room', '3D', 'model', 'Prometheus', 'bridge', 'mapped', 'alien', 'complex', 'really', 'forward', 'then', 'David', 'standing', 'middle', 'alien', 'navigation', 'diagram', 'still', 'as', 'exciting', 'was', 'theater', 'version', 'film', 'well', 'can', 'view', 'properly', 'enough', '3D', 'keep', 'interest', 'being', 'top.3D', 'seemingly', 'way', 'broadcast', 'side', 'let', 'hope', 'not', 'dead', 'format', 'be', 'experienced', 'theaters', 'disks', 'Prometheus', '5/5', '3D', 'transfer', 'effects', '5/5', 'Amazon', 'price', 'cheap', '4/5', 'being', 'potentially', 'confusing', 'multiple', 'views', '4/5', 'cus', 'not', 'Alien', 'Aliens']",N/A

Who can forget the Alien after you've enjoyed that oldie but goodie.  Then I rented the video on Amazon - why buy when you can rent, eh?  I liked this movie so much I then bought the blue-ray.The movie, I give five stars.  I am looking forward to the sequels that are sure to follow.  Fantastic story line, great effects and the effects dont' overwhelm.  The acting is awesome - even the side cast did a fantastic job with believable characters.  So much so that you can't tell who the main players are for quite a while - and the twist at the end made me go ""wow!""The Blue ray menu system on this particular set is my only complaint.  It requires a huge amount of memory and if you don't have aux memory on your blue ray player, you will get an error message - then you can watch the movie.  Without the menu system, though, you cannot watch the extras which are pretty good.  To give perspective, I never watch the extras typically, and a movie has to be fantastic for me to bother.My one complaint about the deleted/alternative and extended scenes is you cannot watch the movie with those add-ins so you can see the impact on the story.  Since they were all batched together, I couldn't really even pick out the alternative paths and wasn't able to figure out what was diffent as far as an alternative ending goes.So if you want a fantastic movie, like sci-fi and want to see what turns out to be a stretch-of-a-prequel to Alien, rent the movie.  If you want to own it like I did after watching it, look for a better packaging that gives you the ability to select rewatching the movie with the alternates in line.

It looks better than just about any movie ever made.That's where the good ends.This script is a disaster. No one ever acts logically, in fact, they almost always act in exact opposition to logic. A scientist that starts an expedition based on no objective interpretation of hard data, but on her ""belief""in what she WANTS her data to mean. Archeologists that are ""depressed"" at the discovery of the first proof of an alien civilization just because they can't talk to any of the long dead aliens. A geologist WHOSE SOLE PURPOSE IS TO MAP THE RUINS they are exploring, who gets LOST despite the fact that HE'S THE ONE WITH THE BLOODY MAP. A biologist who, after seeing a room full of dead alien bodies (done in by some unknown attacker), discovers a giant hissing alien worm and his first reaction is to POKE IT.This is just the set up to the mess that follows. Entire sequences happen concurrently without ever affecting one another, so that they seem to be from different movies. You keep waiting for the actions in one to affect the other, and they never do, indeed, they often never come up again at all. And the final ""reveals"" are so stupid (not to mention telegraphed) that all the tension in the third act is just sucked out the airlock.The connections to the Alien movies simply muddle things further. These plot elements don't actually make sense in relation to the original two movies, and they don't add much of anything to the film on its own. This film would have been better off as a stand alone film rather than being a prequel, since the connection only serves to make an incoherent script downright inconsistent.You could go, scene by scene, through the entire movie, and find something very wrong in each sequence. It's that big a mess. And it's all due to a screenplay that thinks it's being profound by asking ""big questions"" when it has absolutely no idea what questions it is actually asking, let alone how to answer any of them. This is not surprising when you learn that the screenplay was written by one of the showrunners from LOST, the king of ""make-it-up-as-you-go-without-any-idea-where-you're-going"" storytelling.Any assertions that the movie is somehow deeply profound or spiritual and that those who do not like it just don't ""get it"" is pseudo-intellectual mental masturbation. You might as well assert that you can see the Emperor's new clothes, whereas I see a naked fool walking down the street.This movie LOOKS and SOUNDS like it should be a really good film, and the performances are for the most part really solid.

Acting was decent to very well, in my opinion. Story was my main issue. This is set in the Alien universe, years before the first film, but this creates the issues mostly due to problems with the production staff. Ridley Scott was trying to make a not too direct prequel to Alien. However, the head writer, Damon Lindelof, was trying to expand the universe with whole new characters and a whole new franchise that wouldn't go anywhere near Aliens and Ellen Ripley. Basically a spinoff franchise. You combine these two visions and you get Prometheus. A disappointment for Alien fans (as I will discuss below) and a decent sci-fi film for those who have never seen Alien and its sequels. I will go on to say, however, whether an Alien fan or a new viewer, this film does have an ominous ending leaving old and new questions unanswered on purpose for hopes of a definite sequel.SPOILERS AHEAD.This was a complicated movie as it raised hopes for those of us who have seen the Alien franchise and eager to see this supposed prequel to explain the origins of the Alien. However, it didn't quite do that. As my post title says, this movie created more questions than it answered. This movie goes off in a tangent explaining supposedly who/what created the aliens and mankind itself, but there are just too many problems. First off, it doesn't really tell us where the Alien came from. Supposedly, some say the Engineers made them, indirectly, as some sort of biological weapon. Indirectly because if the engineers ingest the black spore liquid, they literally start dissolving. Other creatures are mutated into killing machines, such as the worms or maggots in the room with the Giant head turning into the snake like hammerpedes, or the geologist turning into some sort of hills have eyes super strong punk monster. Holloway, however, only had a very low dose of the black spore liquid so it was slowly killing him and mutating him. His mutated sperm was somehow able to impregnate a sterile woman, with what turns out to be some sort of facehugger, which attachs to an engineer and has some sort of xenomorph pop out of his chest, possibly an ancestral precursor to the familiar aliens as it does not fully have all their characteristics. This would make some sense if it wasn't for the plot hole of the biologist and the geologist looking at a mural in the room with the giant head of what is obviously an Alien that looks exactly like the ones from the original films. Why would the Engineers have a mural of the familiar Alien if it has never been encountered before (if you follow the process the movie has that I outlined above)? And why would they have a mural of it anyway, like it's some sort of god to them or something? Scott says if they make a sequel and it is successful, its successor (a third movie) would be the direct link between these new movies and the original Alien. Unless Lindelof is involved. He says if Scott and the studios want to work with him, they have to move the new franchise away from the old. I think this guy trying to sabotage the Alien prequel is more intense than the entire movie. I hope Ridley Scott and James Cameron get beck to trying to make a fifth Alien movie with each other.

1475256,A31LHED3SKLWVB,B005LAIHXQ,Darren,"[2, 6]","Well, this is what happens when you believe your own hype, your own mythology.  In Ridley Scott's &#34;Alien&#34; from 1979, there's a brief scene where the crew of the &#34;Nostromo&#34; find a giant figure, long dead, in a large captain's chair -- the famous &#34;space jockey&#34;.  33 years later, Scott took this brief, mood-setting bit from a great film he made in his youth and turned it into one of the most pretentious world-building exercises I've ever seen.  Turns out the space jockey was an &#34;Engineer&#34;, part of a godlike race that found our planet tens of thousands of years ago and created life as we know it.  This &#34;terraforming&#34; is accomplished by our pale muscled giant opening a cup of blackberry yogurt and sucking it down.Next: it's 2089, and we're flying spaceships to distant parts of the galaxy (yeah, right), looking for aliens we think we saw on cave paintings.  Smh.For a thorough dissecting of the mindboggling stupidity of the characters' actions, I refer you to Alfred J. Bullock's review on the front page.  Mr. Bullock turned the bad plot into a fun questionnaire, which is more than I'm capable of.  I can only add that Noomi Rapace is an unprepossessing lead actor who won't be replacing Sigourney Weaver in the public's hearts anytime soon.  There's a smarmy hunk who plays her love interest.  There's Michael Fassbender as the android &#34;David&#34; -- we can only mourn that his fine and chilly performance is wasted here.  Charlize Theron apparently hasn't aged a day in 15 years.  Maybe she sleeps in a cryogenic pod,Despite unusually crisp photography, cool effects, choice locations, and a rather great scene where Rapace is trying to rid herself of an unwanted bodily guest, this film stinks.  The many nods to the original &#34;Alien&#34; film don't save it,  Scott's ongoing fascination with reproduction themes and imagery doesn't save it, and his ongoing fascination with artificial intelligence doesn't save it.  Those elements certainly make &#34;Prometheus&#34; an &#34;auteur&#34; picture, but that doesn't mean that this is a good, let alone interesting, picture.  It is, in fact, quite boring.  After all, we've been down this road with Scott so many times before.  It's also a gyp: we're led to believe we'll find &#34;answers&#34; to humanity's oldest questions, but Scott's writers obviously don't know what those answers are and in any case they're probably too timid to venture an opinion.  Instead, they set up a sequel: who made the Makers?  Great.  Who cares?  I would've preferred a fun and well-done monster movie.1 out of 5.",1,Boo Ridley,1401667200,"06 2, 2014",2014,2603,"['Well', 'what', 'when', 'believe', 'own', 'hype', 'own', 'mythology', 'Ridley', 'Scott', '34', 'Alien', '34', '1979', 'brief', 'scene', 'where', 'crew', '34', 'Nostromo', '34', 'find', 'giant', 'figure', 'long', 'dead', 'large', 'captain', 'chair', 'famous', '34', 'space', 'jockey', '34', '33', 'years', 'later', 'Scott', 'took', 'brief', 'mood-setting', 'bit', 'great', 'film', 'made', 'youth', 'turned', 'one', 'most', 'pretentious', 'world-building', 'exercises', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'out', 'space', 'jockey', 'was', '34', 'Engineer', '34', 'part', 'godlike', 'race', 'found', 'planet', 'tens', 'thousands', 'years', 'ago', 'created', 'life', 'know', '34', 'terraforming', '34', 'accomplished', 'pale', 'muscled', 'giant', 'opening', 'cup', 'blackberry', 'yogurt', 'sucking', 'down.Next', '2089', ""'re"", 'flying', 'spaceships', 'distant', 'parts', 'galaxy', 'yeah', 'right', 'looking', 'aliens', 'think', 'saw', 'cave', 'paintings', 'Smh.For', 'thorough', 'dissecting', 'mindboggling', 'stupidity', 'characters', 'actions', 'refer', 'Alfred', 'J.', 'Bullock', 'review', 'front', 'page', 'Mr.', 'Bullock', 'turned', 'bad', 'plot', 'fun', 'questionnaire', 'more', ""'m"", 'capable', 'can', 'only', 'add', 'Noomi', 'Rapace', 'unprepossessing', 'lead', 'actor', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'replacing', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'public', 'hearts', 'anytime', 'soon', 'smarmy', 'hunk', 'who', 'love', 'interest', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'android', '34', 'David', '34', 'can', 'only', 'mourn', 'fine', 'chilly', 'performance', 'wasted', 'here', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'apparently', ""n't"", 'aged', 'day', '15', 'years', 'Maybe', 'cryogenic', 'pod', 'unusually', 'crisp', 'photography', 'cool', 'effects', 'choice', 'locations', 'rather', 'great', 'scene', 'where', 'Rapace', 'trying', 'rid', 'herself', 'unwanted', 'bodily', 'guest', 'film', 'stinks', 'many', 'nods', 'original', '34', 'Alien', '34', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'save', 'Scott', 'ongoing', 'fascination', 'reproduction', 'themes', 'imagery', ""n't"", 'save', 'ongoing', 'fascination', 'artificial', 'intelligence', ""n't"", 'save', 'elements', 'certainly', 'make', '34', 'Prometheus', '34', '34', 'auteur', '34', 'picture', ""n't"", 'mean', 'good', 'let', 'alone', 'interesting', 'picture', 'fact', 'quite', 'boring', ""'ve"", 'been', 'road', 'Scott', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'also', 'gyp', ""'re"", 'led', 'believe', ""'ll"", 'find', '34', 'answers', '34', 'humanity', 'oldest', 'questions', 'Scott', 'writers', 'obviously', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'answers', 'are', 'case', ""'re"", 'probably', 'too', 'timid', 'venture', 'opinion', 'Instead', 'set', 'up', 'sequel', 'who', 'made', 'Makers', 'Great', 'Who', 'would', ""'ve"", 'preferred', 'fun', 'well-done', 'monster', 'movie.1', '5']",N/A

Wend,"[0, 0]","If you have not seen the film, there are spoilers, below.I saw Prometheus first when it was in theaters and found it interesting but somewhat bewildering in some of its plot development. On taking a second look recently, I found I enjoyed the film much more as a nave journey to find the extraterrestrial origins of the Earth.  The opening of the film is among my favorites, as we watch the robot David going through his daily routine as the crew and scientists sleep.The idea of setting off on a space voyage in search of alien forms of life is hardly a new concept in film.  What makes this film work are the strong performances of the cast.  Michael Fassbender's David is fascinating to watch, although a robot exhibiting high intelligence he also imbues his character with a touch of humanity. He is nave and sinister by turns. He mimics Peter O'Toole after watching Lawrence of Arabia and administers the lethal biological weapon being developed by the aliens without regard for the consequences.Noomi Rapace brings out the idealism of her character (Elizabeth Shaw) believing that the aliens they are setting off to visit will somehow be benign creators only to discover the opposite. Even though she has every reason to believe the mission is a failure, Shaw wants to pursue her questions deeper into how humans failed their creators. While Elizabeth Shaw represents the inspiration behind the expedition her fellow scientist and lover Charlie Holloway (played by Logan Marshall-Green) is the force behind the quest.Charlize Theron plays the formidable Meredith Vickers, who represents the corporation financing the mission.  Clearly, Vickers does not believe in the mission and has no regard for the other members of the crew. The fact that she has her own module that can be ejected from the ship underscores that she intends to survive if things go bad. Her hostility is more than not believing in the mission and is only revealed by the presence of her father on board Prometheus.The film has a lot of suspense but is also has plot twists that seem lifted from Alien. Some of the action is contrived and certainly, the unforgettable scene where the pregnant Noomi Rapace has radical surgery and manages to walk away stretches belief to the limit.  For me, with all its faults Prometheus remains a highly interesting film and one that I would want to see more than once if only to appreciate the stunning visual effects.

I really wanted to like it and it delivers masterfully on a visual level.  There are also some very good individual scenes.  Unfortunately, the screenplay is pretty much a mess.  It's hard to imagine that such an unprofessional, irrational group of characters would be selected for such an important mission.  Exhibit A: the team members who decide to bail in the middle of a trip to an alien relic because they decide it's too scary but also think it's a good idea to try to pet a weird-looking alien.  The film also raises a lot of unanswered questions about the Engineers and their motivations.  I enjoy it when a well-written film declines to answer all the questions it raises, but this script has so many inconsistencies that any planned ambiguities get lost in the general sloppiness.Nevertheless, since I can't award half-stars, I'm going with four instead of three.  I was consistently entertained by the effects and performances, there are some great set pieces (such as a brutal dust storm), and I can't deny a certain thrill at the iconic sight of (SPOILER AHEAD!) an Engineer transforming into the Space Jockey from ""Alien"" as he seats himself at the controls of his ship.

Well I saw it on opening day and found it to be a worthy addition to the franchise so I've pre-ordered the 3-D version and look forward to getting it when it becomes available. There are a number of unanswered questions the film leaves the viewer wondering about and I hope that I find some clues on my second viewing when the disc comes in.The movie itself is about a discovery which promises to reveal important information about the origins of man. An expedition is sent across space to try and uncover more truths about this discovery. What they find turns into a challenge for their survival as very unfriendly forces are unleashed which must be defeated or the crew from earth will all suffer death.The movie ends just as the story takes a new direction which is setting up the audience for a sequel. Should that one get made I'll probably get it too for my ""Alien"" collection. Although this story takes place in the familiar alien universe it is pre-Ripley and not directly related to the older movie, ""Alien."" The story line is similar in that a strong female personality survives adversity and an aberrant android with a hidden agenda complicates life for all of his unsuspecting shipmates.The movie was actually less violent than the previews of coming movies that were shown before ""Prometheus"" started. This is one of those sci-fi action flicks that are reasonably cerebral with sufficiently toned down violence to avoid running off the non-fan of the franchise.We found the movie satisfying and entertaining and I look forward to seeing it again.

1475266,AAE2DUEMTR30I,B005LAIHXQ,DAVID BRYSON,"[2, 8]","All I have is one single, simple DVD of Prometheus, so that is all I can review or would even try to. Naturally I am interested in the production, the direction and the acting, and of course I was hoping for great things in the department of camera-work and special effects. However what I am rating this film on is one thing more than all the rest put together - the story.That is not quite the same thing as the `plot', which I can tell you would not get four stars from me. I mean, these intrepid boldly-goers take the most irresponsible risks you could imagine. One of them is an android, sure, and he probably is the worst offender, but that is only because he is operating in obedience to His Master's Voice, and the master is another human being. Not only that, he is a business tycoon who seems to have been totally unsupervised by anyone supposedly given responsibility for protecting the rest of us. Business deregulation is all very well within rational limits, I dare say, but even now in 2012 we are all too aware of what some financial interests did to us and what they nearly did when we took our eye off them. That was only money, I suppose, but what this well-spoken old English geezer is playing with is the very survival of humanity to satisfy his own moribund curiosity, which seems to bother nobody. I shall not complain about the general scenario of interstellar travel being a fait accompli within this century, within my grandchildren's lifetime on a reasonable actuarial basis, because without that I would not have my treasured story at all. However I must protest about the collision between the spacecraft. In the context of the threatened apocalypse, and considering the power that these interstellar ships must have packed, this climactic scene is downright tame. Think of the wreck of the Hindenburg.Still, the story gave me most of what I was looking for. The original Alien was found aboard an abandoned spaceship of unknown provenance or destination. That film was followed with three sequels, each in my opinion weaker than the one before. All the time I craved information regarding that sinister craft, and I have got it at last. Whether the craft's mission was one I might have expected I'm not sure because I had no clear ideas about that, but what we have here is a good old sci-fi yarn, of the kind I am old enough to enjoy because I have read so many of them. It tells us the origin of our race, which is rather an unexciting origin, humanity on earth being no more than a modified version of some other pre-existing beings, hailing from somewhere else but exactly like us only bigger.Right at the end guess which old friend puts in a cameo appearance: I shall mask its identity subtly behind the abbreviation A...n. What goes along with this is the clear promise of further sequels, and these I shall make a point of surviving long enough to watch, because the heroine and the robot commandeer a spare spaceship to head off into the realm where our deep-space ancestors really originated. Her interest in this is curiosity again, I suppose, but this time of a more reputable kind, given what she has been through, than the old moneybags had.The acting is not exactly Oscars stuff, and the script is a bit wooden in places, especially near the start, but it is not bad in general. The special effects department do very well, as you would expect. As in Alien, there are some fine creepy sequences that may take you two viewings to appreciate in the dim light - what-are-they-seeing-that-I'm-not-seeing kind of stuff. However two viewings and I think I have got the whole plot, or most of it. I might even watch it again sometime, but what I really want is the sequel.",4,IN THE BEGINNING,1349827200,"10 10, 2012",2012,3709,"['have', 'one', 'single', 'simple', 'DVD', 'Prometheus', 'can', 'review', 'would', 'even', 'try', 'Naturally', 'am', 'interested', 'production', 'direction', 'acting', 'course', 'was', 'hoping', 'great', 'things', 'department', 'camera-work', 'special', 'effects', 'However', 'what', 'am', 'rating', 'film', 'one', 'thing', 'more', 'rest', 'put', 'together', 'story.That', 'not', 'quite', 'same', 'thing', 'plot', 'can', 'tell', 'would', 'not', 'get', 'four', 'stars', 'mean', 'intrepid', 'boldly-goers', 'take', 'most', 'irresponsible', 'risks', 'could', 'imagine', 'One', 'android', 'sure', 'probably', 'worst', 'offender', 'only', 'operating', 'obedience', 'Master', 'Voice', 'master', 'human', 'being', 'Not', 'only', 'that', 'business', 'tycoon', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'totally', 'unsupervised', 'anyone', 'supposedly', 'given', 'responsibility', 'protecting', 'rest', 'Business', 'deregulation', 'very', 'well', 'rational', 'limits', 'dare', 'say', 'even', 'now', '2012', 'are', 'too', 'aware', 'what', 'financial', 'interests', 'did', 'what', 'nearly', 'did', 'when', 'took', 'eye', 'was', 'only', 'money', 'suppose', 'what', 'well-spoken', 'old', 'English', 'geezer', 'playing', 'very', 'survival', 'humanity', 'satisfy', 'own', 'moribund', 'curiosity', 'bother', 'nobody', 'shall', 'not', 'complain', 'general', 'scenario', 'interstellar', 'travel', 'being', 'fait', 'accompli', 'century', 'grandchildren', 'lifetime', 'reasonable', 'actuarial', 'basis', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'treasured', 'story', 'However', 'must', 'protest', 'collision', 'spacecraft', 'context', 'threatened', 'apocalypse', 'considering', 'power', 'interstellar', 'ships', 'must', 'have', 'packed', 'climactic', 'scene', 'downright', 'tame', 'Think', 'wreck', 'Hindenburg.Still', 'story', 'gave', 'most', 'what', 'was', 'looking', 'original', 'Alien', 'was', 'found', 'abandoned', 'spaceship', 'unknown', 'provenance', 'destination', 'film', 'was', 'followed', 'three', 'sequels', 'opinion', 'weaker', 'one', 'before', 'time', 'craved', 'information', 'regarding', 'sinister', 'craft', 'have', 'got', 'last', 'craft', 'mission', 'was', 'one', 'might', 'have', 'expected', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'had', 'clear', 'ideas', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'good', 'old', 'sci-fi', 'yarn', 'kind', 'am', 'old', 'enough', 'enjoy', 'have', 'read', 'so', 'many', 'origin', 'race', 'rather', 'unexciting', 'origin', 'humanity', 'earth', 'being', 'more', 'modified', 'version', 'other', 'pre-existing', 'beings', 'hailing', 'somewhere', 'else', 'exactly', 'only', 'bigger.Right', 'end', 'guess', 'old', 'friend', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'shall', 'mask', 'identity', 'subtly', 'abbreviation', 'n.', 'What', 'along', 'clear', 'promise', 'further', 'sequels', 'shall', 'make', 'point', 'surviving', 'long', 'enough', 'watch', 'heroine', 'robot', 'commandeer', 'spare', 'spaceship', 'head', 'off', 'realm', 'where', 'deep-space', 'ancestors', 'really', 'originated', 'interest', 'curiosity', 'again', 'suppose', 'time', 'more', 'reputable', 'kind', 'given', 'what', 'been', 'old', 'moneybags', 'had.The', 'acting', 'not', 'exactly', 'Oscars', 'stuff', 'script', 'bit', 'wooden', 'places', 'especially', 'start', 'not', 'bad', 'general', 'special', 'effects', 'department', 'do', 'very', 'well', 'would', 'expect', 'Alien', 'are', 'fine', 'creepy', 'sequences', 'may', 'take', 'two', 'viewings', 'appreciate', 'dim', 'light', ""what-are-they-seeing-that-I'm-not-seeing"", 'kind', 'stuff', 'However', 'two', 'viewings', 'think', 'have', 'got', 'whole', 'plot', 'most', 'might', 'even', 'watch', 'again', 'sometime', 'what', 'really', 'want', 'sequel']",N/A

The Trailer's for this film had me on the edge of my seat. I thought for certain this was going to be a billion dollar hit.

The imagery from the commercial leads one to believe that we will find out who the 'space jockey,' as he's known was and how his ship came to crash on LV426. But very soon in the film we learn this is not LV426 so this can't be the space jockey from Alien.They tricked us!With regards to the plot holes, I won't go into all of them, (my lunch break is only an hour).

1475278,A1H2QTHHP2DJJ5,B005LAIHXQ,David Thompson,"[1, 1]","Ridley Scott seems to be setting up a storyline that connects Blade Runner to Prometheus to Alien. Promotional materials released in England at the time of the London premiere of Prometheus included a screen capture of a statement written by Peter Weyland. A statement in which he discusses his professional relationship with Eldon Tyrell and the Tyrell Corporation. Weyland broke with Eldon Tyrell when he realized that Tyrell wanted to create Replicants for the purpose of various forms of slave labor. Peter Weyland believed that Replicants had a ""higher purpose"". So the Weyland Corporation began creating their own line of Replicants. Ash, Bishop and David are Replicants, but for a very prosaic reason they're not referred to as Replicants. Why? Because the term Replicant, as applied to androids, is co-owned by the estate of Philip K. Dick and Warner Brothers. And the Alien movies are owned 20th Century Fox, and licensing-the-use-rights-fees would have to be paid...I've been told that much of this Peter Weyland/Eldon Tyrell backstory is told in the Special Features of the Blu-ray and the Blu-ray/3D editions of Prometheus. So...order those editions from Amazon, if you want to learn more about the Weyland/Tyrell connection. The online ordering information is available through a link on this page. Amazon's computers are waiting to take your call...I suspect that David is a Nexus 8, who's been given a voice similar to the voice given to the Hal 9000 mainframe computer, that went online at the IBM laboratory in Urbana, ILL, in the 1990's. The Hal 9000 was installed in the spaceship Discovery, for its mission to Jupiter, in the early years of the 21st century. The history of that space mission is highly classified. Top Secret. Not even accessible to those with the highest security clearance. NASA has put those files deep into cold storage...metaphorically speaking. Something about cultural shock and disorientation, should those files go public...However, footage related to that expedition IS available from Amazon! Just enter...2001: A Space Odyssey...Footnote: Rumor has it that Ridley Scott wants to make a sequel to Blade Runner. Rumor also has it that Harrison Ford wants to play Rick Deckard again. Which would necessitate setting the story approximately 30 years after the first film...around 2050. But I emphasize, these are just rumors at this time, unless someone out there in Amazon Land knows more than I do.Sir Ridley has also said he intends to make a sequel to Prometheus. The story of David and Elizabeth Shaw's journey to the home planet of the Engineers. And Dr. Shaw's confrontation with the Engineers, asking them why they created human kind and then wanted to destroy human kind, with that bio-weapon of mass destruction...the Alien, which seemed to have bitten the hand that created it...so to speak. So, perhaps both films will be coming soon to a multiplex near you. And subsequently available in Blu-ray, 3D and DVD from Amazon.

Many times the actors reactions did not seem appropriate to the scene.  It appears as if they were directed to act one way and then editing may have made their reaction seem out of place.No doubt most of Ridley's time was spent on the set, nobody does sets better, he started as a set builder and designer.

Well, I wish that the premise itself could have been improved upon- the fossil evidence related to human evolution is overwhelming and thus the idea that we are created by advanced humanoids is a bit ridiculous. I think a much better plot device could have been created. Apparently the Engineers were using a  moon of a gas giant as a bioweapons lab and something went wrong and the facility was destroyed by by the bioweapons. Prometheus's crew is entirely disfunctional and different teams have competing , or at leats non-aligned , agendas, dooming the mission from the start, in all reality.(This is another aspect of the plot which requires the suspension of belief on the part of the viewer. ) The Engineers were apparently about to seed Earth with a bio-weapon (which we know of as ""The Alien"") to eliminate humankind (I guess we didn't turn out well enough) when their progeny escaped and destroyed their creators. One Engineer is found in stasis by the Prometheus's android and awoken and then he tries to complete his mission and the Prometheus rams the alien spaceship and both are destroyed. It's hard to imagine that a civilization of the Engineers technological level would not have a way to destroy the Prometheus before it hits the alien ship. At the end, the lone human survivor of the Prometheus heads off in another Engineer starship on a searxch for their home planet- could make an interesting sequel, I suppose.While the plot was bit disappointing I liked the production design and how everything more or less fit in with the first Alien movie. For example, the alien we see in the big room in the first movie, sitting in some kind of hgiant chair with its chest burst open, is simply another Engineer which was infected with an Alien and died while trying to launch his craft. The Alien ship is spectacular- you have to wonder about the technology needed to create sush a vessel and you forget for a few moments that it's just a movie.

Although tied to the Alien films, ""Prometheus"" is creepy and suspenseful but doesn't dwell in the high-octane gore of the original films -- it's there, but it's not the whole point of the film.  Instead, big concepts about the conquest of space, cosmic seeding and the spiritual yearnings of aliens, androids and man are probed and examined, and many big questions are left dangling, tantalizingly in need of further exploration. I can't remember a recent movie I've wanted a sequel of more than this one - I'm itching to see what happens next!In addition to the direction and special effects, the acting is also pretty good. I did not care much for the pair of lead actors Noomi Rapace and Logan Marshall-Green (the scientists behind the expedition) although Charlize Theron is fine as their unlikable corporate minder, and Idris Alba is fun as the noble spaceship captain (with major props to the supporting actors who played his crew...) The breakaway star of this show, though, is the steely-eyed Michael Fassbender, who plays David, the film's obligatory android, who is a spine-tingling combination of 2001's HAL and Star Trek's Data, one of the best portrayals of an AI being you'll ever see. Truly delicious. The aliens look cool, too.Bravo for Ridley Scott, who is back in the saddle again... Hopefully the studios will be smart and keep him at the helm for the planned sequels...

Sorry, ""Prometheus"" didn't do it for me. Yeah, I know we might be a little sick of our old drooling friend with the acid blood, but at least he didn't talk, which is more than I can say for everyone in this movie. In fact, they yak all the way through it.

The problem wasn't the casting. The set was well done and seemed well set up for a sci-fi movie.The director was Ridley Scott who usually does a good job with the movies that he is involved in. Considering all of these things, why was this movie a disappointment? I my opinion it had to be the script itself. The writing was kind of disjointed. The script left more questions about the alien race than it answered. The actions of most of the crew didn't make much sense with the exception of Idris Elba's character as the captain and Noomi Rapace's character.I also didn't understand why they chose to have Idris Elba do a southern accent when they had other characters with british accents. Idris Elba with a british accent has a commanding presence. Why waste that?If this script had been well written with a better storyline, this movie would have had great potential.

The vistas and visuals created in PROMETHEUS are breathtaking and believable; a futuristic expedition to one of Saturn's moons to--perhaps--discover mankind's ancestral roots sets a promising beginning--until we get to vet and learn about the various characters, who are not only exceedingly reckless, but hopelessly unlikable and petulant and petty.  Yet even these disadvantages are trumped by the non-climax. . .when we learn that, ultimately, PROMETHEUS is merely a mind-numbing prequel for (*spoiler alert!*) Scott's classicAlien.  Such a discovery garners little more than irritable ire and growing contempt; the viewer, having invested two hours into this increasingly silly romp, feels utterly ripped off.With the exception of Noomi Rapace (a poor man's Sigourney Weaver)--whose self-performed abortion promises to cause excessive squirming--PROMETHEUS presents a cast of forgettable, or completely unlikable, characters, from Michael Fassbender as a conniving humanoid, to Charlize Theron as the expedition's stone-faced, unemotional commander, to Logan Marshall-Green as the Rapace character's love interest who is so clueless and reckless his demise can be seen from a thousand clicks away.  As to the rest of the cast:  Who was in this movie?  Beats the stuffings out of me.  With an A+ for visuals, but an F- for plot, character assassination, and gilded conclusion, PROMETHEUS is a Ridley Scott offering I'll be happy to avoid on any and all future occasions.

Ridley Scott, Damon Lindelof, Noomi Rapace, link to the ""Alien"" franchise? I'm there, when does it open?Saw it in IMAX 3D, and that's the way it was meant to be seen. A great use of that median, especially Fassbender's scene with the interstellar map. You feel like you are in the room. It is a spectacular gorgeous film, the fly by over Iceland in the beginning is remarkable, and the action/horror scenes have an added impact, due to the sight and sound technology. Kudos to Scott for using all of it.Lindelof's script revisits a ""Lost"" theme - Science versus/and faith. Rapace's Shaw is at the center, a scientist who believes in a God, and wants to find the Creator. ""Where did we come from"" is her big question. Rapace is surrounded with a great cast, including Fassbender (who delivers his part excellently), Theron, Elba, Pearce and even Kate Dickie (crazy Lysa Arryns from Game of Thrones.)It's Ridley's ride, and he takes you from feeling whistful and optimistic to being horrified and scared in the space of 2 hours. It does have all of the elements of the original ""Alien"". Space jockey, face hugger, chest burster, robot, evil corporation, it's all there. Noomi Rapace as Lizbeth Shaw fulfills every expectation I had of her. She is the motor to the movie, the one to watch.I've read where some folks don't like the film because it doesn't answer any questions. I wouldn't see this movie in that light, since when do we ever get the answers we want with anything Lindelof writes? It is a great sci-fi film, and you should see it if you are a fan of the genre, and especially if you love the ""Alien"" franchise. See it on the big screen, then buy the Blu Ray. Sit back, enjoy.I was 18 years old when I saw the first ""Alien"" movie in the theater. I remember how it made me feel to this day - scared, horrified, anxious, suspenseful, and finally thrilled when the hero turned out to be a woman. It was the first VHS tape I bought, it was the first DVDs (box set) I bought, I even named my dog Ripley. I love this franchise, and ""Prometheus"" is a fine addition.EDIT: I was so fascinated by this movie in IMAX 3D I went and saw it again, knowing that I would probably never have that chance again. I spent the week in between reading reviews and interviews about the film.  I enjoyed it as much the second time, and believe that this is one helluva sci-fi film. I'd say it's Scott's best film in years. ""Prometheus"" manages to find a balance as a beautiful, thoughtful clever film, with some very visceral horror thrown in. The action snaps along at brisk pace, the music score is great,and there are some interesting techniques used to move the story along that I've never seen before.I eagerly wait for this Blu ray dvd to be released, I'd love to see the directors cut.",5,Ridley's Ride,1339459200,"06 12, 2012",2012,2856,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'film', 'read', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'Damon', 'Lindelof', 'Noomi', 'Rapace', 'link', 'Alien', 'franchise', ""'m"", 'there', 'when', 'open', 'Saw', 'IMAX', '3D', 'way', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'seen', 'great', 'use', 'median', 'especially', 'Fassbender', 'scene', 'interstellar', 'map', 'feel', 'are', 'room', 'spectacular', 'gorgeous', 'film', 'fly', 'Iceland', 'beginning', 'remarkable', 'action/horror', 'scenes', 'have', 'added', 'impact', 'due', 'sight', 'sound', 'technology', 'Kudos', 'Scott', 'using', 'it.Lindelof', 'script', 'Lost', 'theme', 'Science', 'versus/and', 'faith', 'Rapace', 'Shaw', 'center', 'scientist', 'who', 'God', 'find', 'Creator', 'Where', 'did', 'come', 'big', 'question', 'Rapace', 'surrounded', 'great', 'cast', 'including', 'Fassbender', 'who', 'part', 'excellently', 'Theron', 'Elba', 'Pearce', 'even', 'Kate', 'Dickie', 'crazy', 'Lysa', 'Arryns', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'Ridley', 'ride', 'feeling', 'whistful', 'optimistic', 'being', 'horrified', 'scared', 'space', '2', 'hours', 'have', 'elements', 'original', 'Alien', 'Space', 'jockey', 'face', 'hugger', 'chest', 'burster', 'robot', 'evil', 'corporation', 'there', 'Noomi', 'Rapace', 'Lizbeth', 'Shaw', 'expectation', 'had', 'motor', 'movie', 'one', 'watch.I', ""'ve"", 'read', 'where', 'folks', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'film', ""n't"", 'answer', 'questions', 'would', ""n't"", 'see', 'movie', 'light', 'when', 'do', 'ever', 'get', 'answers', 'want', 'anything', 'Lindelof', 'great', 'sci-fi', 'film', 'should', 'see', 'are', 'fan', 'genre', 'especially', 'love', 'Alien', 'franchise', 'See', 'big', 'screen', 'then', 'buy', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'Sit', 'back', 'enjoy.I', 'was', '18', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'saw', 'first', 'Alien', 'movie', 'theater', 'remember', 'how', 'made', 'feel', 'day', 'scared', 'horrified', 'anxious', 'suspenseful', 'finally', 'thrilled', 'when', 'hero', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'woman', 'was', 'first', 'VHS', 'tape', 'bought', 'was', 'first', 'DVDs', 'box', 'set', 'bought', 'even', 'named', 'dog', 'Ripley', 'love', 'franchise', 'Prometheus', 'fine', 'addition.EDIT', 'was', 'so', 'fascinated', 'movie', 'IMAX', '3D', 'went', 'saw', 'again', 'knowing', 'would', 'probably', 'never', 'have', 'chance', 'again', 'spent', 'week', 'reading', 'reviews', 'interviews', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'much', 'second', 'time', 'believe', 'one', 'helluva', 'sci-fi', 'film', ""'d"", 'say', 'Scott', 'best', 'film', 'years', 'Prometheus', 'find', 'balance', 'beautiful', 'thoughtful', 'clever', 'film', 'very', 'visceral', 'horror', 'thrown', 'action', 'along', 'brisk', 'pace', 'music', 'score', 'great', 'are', 'interesting', 'techniques', 'used', 'move', 'story', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'before.I', 'eagerly', 'wait', 'Blu', 'ray', 'dvd', 'be', 'released', ""'d"", 'love', 'see', 'directors', 'cut']",N/A

Billed as a ""prequel"" to the infamous ""Alien"" franchise, Prometheus had very bill shoes to fill from the get go.  There's been a ""Making Of"" on HBO, where Ridley Scott toots his own horn about this movie.  I would like to ask him if it was his plan to make a movie that would bore people to death?  If that's the case, he succeeded.""Prometheus"" is the name of a spaceship that sets out to investigate alien forms--I guess.  We first see David the Android, played by Michael Fassbender.  He's preparing everyone for wakeup call.  His portrayl was spot-on; however, his character is played without emotion, so what's there to care about him?  Charlize Theron plays Meredith Vickers, who is involved with the company that wants this research or the alien life form.  She usually looks like she's just been hit in the head with a brick, but at least she doesn't chew on the scenery like she did in ""Snow White and the Huntsman.""  When the crew arrives at its destination, Noomi Rapace (playing Liz Shaw) and her boyfriend/lover find some sort of ""temple,"" and they're off to see the Wizard.I saw this movie in a packed theater the day after it opened.  I cannot tell you how much pain I was in just trying to keep myself AWAKE.  For a movie that lasts over two hours, it sure was short on action.  And there's a scene in which Liz Shaw does her own c-section, which was just TOTALLY unbelievable.  I don't care if the movie was set a billion years from now; talk to ANY woman that's had a c-section.  Ask her if she could be on her feet, running five minutes after the procedure.  If that was meant to shock, it didn't.  The ending (did it really have one?) was also laugh-outload funny; so contrived; so nonbelievable.If Ridley Scott or any of his cronies thinks they've created the next science fiction masterpiece, they'd better think again.  Not only did this movie NEVER live up to its billing, it never comes close to the action and story in either ""Alien"" or ""Aliens.""  Both those movies were talked about for quite sometime because they told a great story, the acting was great, and the aliens gave everyone the willies.

The name is practically synonomous with something that will entertain you.And second, who would find fault with a genuine attempt at a good movie??Okay, there are a few problems, but nothing that would prevent me from thoroughly enjoying this movie. It was awesome.For factual people out there, there are some very legitimate ""problems"" with our whole history of evolution. What has been taught and thought for the last 100 years has been a questionable enterprise. There are historical sites around the world that call into question some very basic ideas that most of us hold as TRUE. Current underwater archeology has shown cities that are not where they should be. That the 11 or 13,000 years of human activity may actually be a LOT longer. I know, it infuriates some people to think that some of the human history we accept, may be a little off. Or totally wrong, different, longer. Using Procession of the Earth, some very respected scientists are dating the Great Pyramid to an age of 13,000 years (this would be to accurately point the 'holes' directly at those stars, and there's no way to carbon date the Pyramid, so who's to say?).The point is, that our history IS ACTUALLY a mystery, the greatest mystery. And for someone to offer up a fictional story, exploring an idea is wonderful. No, I don't think that Prometheus accurately tells our historical beginnings, but why not think outside of the BOX? It's the only way we will ever get closer to the truth. The TRUTH, IS INDEED STRANGER THAN FICTION. If anything, I believe that. So go on Ridley, you keep at it, I AM ENTERTAINED.

Moran ""Computer+History/Politics""","[14, 21]","This is yet another Hollywood product that envisions/portrays life as an extension of, or proxy for, high school. Although the actors themselves are obviously older, they are transparently playing 15 year olds. Noomi Rapace stars as an over-the-top spoiled brat/drama queen. And there are the requisite doofuses and other stock characters of this genre. The characters' ""adventures"" are a result of a mix of their impulsiveness, rebelliousness, recklessness, carelessness, and other compulsive and pointless risk-taking behaviors, enhanced by stupidity and inexperience.Although it conforms to the teen horror movie convention of having characters take the most unimaginably stupid actions, it does not qualify as a horror movie because the surprises aren't. Plus I had no empathy for any of the characters. And the only (mild) suspense came from monitoring my own reactions: Did I think that this character deserved to die a slow gruesome death, or did I simply want him/her dead quickly so that the movie would be closer to being over? Turned out to always be the latter.From the reviews, I knew to expect a mediocre movie in terms of plot, but I watched for the visuals. Not worth it. Although extensive, the CGI seemed quite mundane, but it may simply have been overwhelmed by the massive, unrelenting stupidity of the rest of the movie.And some of the key visuals contributed to the sense of ""stupid, stupid, stupid"". One of the strengths of the ""Alien"" movie was its claustrophobic feel and that it conveyed the impression of a real working freighter -- it was packed, cluttered, gritty, and suffering from wear-and-tear. In this movie, the inspiration for the ship's interior comes from mansions dressed for a photo shoot. The rooms are humongous and sparsely furnished, leaving vast open spaces.

But while James Cameron's ""Avatar"" was a crowd-pleasing affair, creating a vibrant, almost psychedelic world, ""Prometheus"" is a somber, cerebral and ambiguous piece of filmmaking.Two archaeologists, Elizabeth (Noomi Rapace) and her boyfriend Charlie (Logan Marshall-Green) discover cave paintings around the world, all from different civilizations and eras, which point to a moon far away in space which has the ability to support life. The two are convinced that the creators of human life (or ""Engineers"" as they refer to them) are from there, and that the paintings are an actual invitation to visit. They find a corporate sponsor (Wayland Corp.) willing to bankroll a trillion-dollar space mission to the faraway moon to investigate (although it's clear from the beginning that they have their own motives beyond just the archeologists' fantasy of meeting humanity's creators). So off Elizabeth and Charlie go, along with an entire crew which includes android David (a spellbinding Michael Fassbender) and Wayland Corp. administrator (an icy Charlize Theron).And so it begins. Anyone who's seen any of the ""Alien"" films will have no doubt that the crew is not, sadly, going to be meeting up with a benevolent, advanced civilization that created humanity and welcomes them with open arms. The film is called ""Prometheus,"" which refers to a Greek myth about a god who is punished for helping humanity by being forced to have his liver eaten, and then regenerate in order to relive the ordeal day after day. In my opinion, the myth of ""Oedipus"" would be just as fitting a reference for this film; Oedipus' fatal flaw, his relentless need to learn the truth, is what caused his downfall and suffering. Similarly, the main characters in the film mostly share a need to find the origin and meaning behind human life, and suffer greatly for it.""Don't we all want to see our parents die?"" asks David at one point, which is a strange question coming from an android who doesn't actually have parents per se.

My original rating was 3.5 stars (3), but rounded to 4 after consuming those two links.=== END EDIT ====About me:- Easygoing, it's just a movie.- I don't expect perfection, because I am not perfect.- I Like *all* genres of film.- Would be hard pressed to really deride/berate any film.- Not a film snob, book snob, and don't need to use big words to build my confidence or assert my value to myself and others.Other Films I Like; I like almost anything, but here are a some favorites (by date):- To Kill a Mockingbird- Being There- Predator- Sleepless in Seattle- Usual Suspects- Yip Man- New in Town- InceptionThis is besides the usual Indiana Jones, Back To the Future, Goonies, Alien, etc, etc series. Pretty much anything with Redford, Newman, Ford... I seriously like almost everything... Legend... hell, I'll admit it, I like Keanu Reeves movies!Films I didn't care for:- The Shinning- anything by Alfred Hitchcock- American Pie- Donnie DarkoThere are others, but these just get under my skin to the point where I'm not interested to watch, which is rare.=======================PROMETHEUS - 4=======================To consider anything about the content of this movie, we must first accept the following (as true for when this movie takes place):#1 Humans have interstellar space travel down.#2 Humans have terraformed other planets.#3 Humans have successfully leveraged stasis.#4 Humans have a level of success with AI.#5 Humans are relying on computers/robots for everything from sensors to surgery.Given that we even today are moving forward into remote/3d surgery, robot assisted surgery, computer implant devices, rovers on Mars that can successfully read everything about an atmosphere, and building theories on terraforming, I can only conclude that when when they do these things as common place in the future, I should trust they are fairly well thought out and would not suffer from ""issues"" one in 2012 might fret about.Now, since you have likely read other reviews that like contained common complaints, let me dismiss those now.#6 You likely heard that one scientists, after learning that the atmosphere (in their survey area) is cleaner than Earths, removes his helmet, and how obviously ""foolish"" this is. Given that we (now) can nearly tell what the atmosphere is like - just by using telescopes, and we can send PC's to planets like Mar's and get complete results on air, soil, water... I have to extrapolate that since we (then) have progressed to interstellar space travel, that our equipment is even more sound, dare I say near perfect. Furthermore, was anyone's panties getting in a bunch when the entire team in Stargate when to another planet with NO helments whatsoever after their probe told them the atmosphere was perfect? And Stargate was present day...So, do yourself a favor and ignore those that cannot imagine how a scientist doing a common place maneuver (for their time) would have the audacity to do so. I mean, I am sure someone in the year 1400 would freak out if they saw me get into a plane and take off. They would be flabbergasted at my lack of worry.#7 You might hear about others saying that the crew released ""mapping devices"" and instead of waiting for the results, continued to explore. They also might say how foolish it is to ignore the writings on the wall that might yield valuable information before continuing the survey. Consider us today, going into a pyramid, cave, etc. Do we enter a cave and instantly translate any writings before moving forward? No, we do a ""survey"" or ""overview"" of the find to determine the extent of the find (the variables), then once done, we go back and investigate with a fine tooth comb with priority based on our findings. It's one thing to want to translate some writings on wall, but first? What if it takes 10 days, and in the very next room there is an alien that can speak English? Furthermore, one might say ""well, the writings might signal a danger"". I suppose they are saying that maybe the alien cave dwellers might have had a ""danger"" sign on the door. In any case, there was nothing dangerous to the aliens in any room - the danger was fruit from unpredicted events. So regardless, the writing would not have helped. Furthermore, would you be so surprised to see an alien on earth flagrantly ignoring the danger signs in our hallways?#8 You might read a lot about ""David's"" behavior. David was an Android (you quickly find this out) who had an entirely different mission (you also quickly find this out) than the other crew. So it's inconsistent to expect David's behavior to match the behaviors of others that are on a quite conflicting mission. It's like wondering why Verbal Kent acted like Kaiser Souze at the end of Usual Suspects. It's like asking the medic in your squad for orders, and your captain for some morphine. Peoples behaviors and consequently our expectations of them should match their mission. The only surprises are for those that want to mash everyone into a single mold.#9 You may hear a lot about the seaworthyness of the crew. There is a realization (not really a reveal) in the movie that explains this (I'll go into this below). The expedition team - the 4 people hired onto the Prometheus - act quite naturally (unfortunately) given their histories and purpose. You'll note that everyone else (ships crew, med staff, and OIC's) act as you'd expect.#10 There are those that might complain about the minute structure and cadence of the film. They might yearn for a different story to have been told because they have a deep seeded need for Ridley Scott to be more what they would like him to be. For them, I can only offer, ""who cares"". If you want to invest a trillion of your dollars into a movie, then it can follow your agenda.=================REVIEW=================This was a fun romp definitely worth $9 to see and a no brainer at $2.99 rental. It added to the mythology of the Aliens/AVP franchise. I don't even need to mention the CGI was awesome, I'm sure nobody insulted that. If you end up watching the extras you will find the film is pretty heavily edited. I heard someone say that they were making two films, but condensed it into one at the last minute because of budget. Consequently there are some sequences that seem misplaced, particularly around Shaw. Shaw can be annoying (correctly so), but a little too annoying thanks to the editing - that was unfortunate, as it made her seem... I hate to use the word again, but she was annoying. Maybe the final OK was given because people like Shaw are in fact generally annoying! Given all they had leaned by 2093, I am sure she was even moreso to them.I think David's part was developed masterfully. I think he plays the largest role of all, and even predict that he is in fact what we will find to be ""Weyland"" during the Ripley era (and beyond?).You may be disappointed at the extent of Guy Pearce's role. I am under the impression a lot of his scenes were omitted or severely cut. He had a (young) extended part in an early preview cut, which was not in the version I saw. I can only conclude he was lost in editing, or, there is more in store. When you see him aged, you might wonder ""why use him?"". Consider Moriarty in the first Sherlock Holms flick. It was obviously not the masterful Jared Harris as in the sequel. Annoying? Perhaps. Would it have been nice to have consistency? Yes. Perhaps that is what this is.Was it perfect? No. I am not the type of person to expect 4, 8, 12 films of a franchise to be perfect. Was it a story? Yes. Did it have to do with Aliens? Yes. Did I like it? Yes. Did I love it? On it's own, no. Can this be changed based on where this story goes next? Yes.================SPOILERS================Given the explanations and expectations above, you can imagine, one should be hard pressed to find ""absolute"" or ""obvious"" fault in this film (unless they are just a blow hard in love with how many words they know). But there are some things that will strike you as odd until they are fully (if ever) explained. Here are some of them:#11 The 4 person expedition team were actually not the expedition team. The only person there with the actual (real) mission was David. The mission was simply to try and extend Weylands life, as he was dying. If Weyland took these measures, that should be confirmation that A) there was no other way he could figure out to extend his life and B) he wanted to live on - not in memory - not in legacy - in real life. Otherwise, he would have had more kids. David is tasked with using (in every sense of the word) this 4 person expedition team to either help locate aliens, or help ""locate"" aliens, if you know what I mean. After all, does your car have a spare tire, and and a jack? Sure it does. Do you still subscribe to AAA roadside? Sure you do. Now imagine if you have trillions of dollars at your disposal.#12 This 4 person team are usable parts for the mission. Knowing this, you could not take the worlds foremost geologist, et al. Why? A) David and your tech can already do anything they can do and B) the worlds foremost biologist would be missed when/if he didn't come back, and suspicions raised. Why take a geologist at all you might ask. Again, C) you have a spare tire and AAA do you not? and D) Weyland needed it to look like a legitimate mission for the two scientists in the lead.#13 Then why did he even need those two scientists in the lead? Because they *believed*. Belief is powerful, and if you can control/manipulate ones beliefs, they will die for you. If you simply pay the person without beliefs, they can fail you in many ways, especially if they think you are almost dead, or they might almost die, or if they already have been paid. His daughter, had she been in control, would have turned around parked on the dark side of the moon for 4 years and said ""Oh, there was nothing there, please die now"". Or worse. David was not 100% trustable because of his apparent lack of a ""soul"". I am sure Weyland had safeguards in David's programming, but as is known in any point in time, your tech is only as good as the next unpredictable moment. That does not stop us from leveraging cars or calculators, or online banking though, does it?#14 Don't let other's fool you. This was NOT a film *about* the origins of humans. This film also did NOT conclude that A) the Engineers were mad at us, B) they wanted to destroy us, and C) they were using their cache as a weapon.

1475362,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,B005LAIHXQ,Dr. James Gardner,"[13, 51]","""Prometheus"" is a prequel to the great classic sci fi film ""Alien"" (1979). It sets out to explain what the spaceship was doing, who was the big guy in the driving seat, and what the alien creatures were designed for. The film does a pretty job in these objectives, but the rest leaves a lot to be desired. This film is so bad I hardly know where to begin. But here goes...* Guy Pearce appears as an old man in makeup. The old man looks like Guy Pearce in old man makeup. Surely with a plethora of old men who are excellent actors (Mickey Rooney, Ernie Borgnine, Peter O'Toole), one of them might have been chosen. Or if the writers and producers had some real imagination, how about an old woman?* If it hadn't been for ""Snow White and the Huntsman"", I could say that this was Charlize Theron's worst performance to date. She is simply terrible. This very talented actress has shown what she can do, but none of it is apparent here.* One of the chief virtues of ""Alien"" and its sequels was the dark foreboding, almost claustrophobic atmosphere. The brightness of this film is a stark contrast.* For a space ship on a 2 year mission to explore an alien environment, there is a stunning lack of military preparedness. Surely at the end of the 21st Century we have more lethal weapons at our disposal than a shotgun, 2 flame throwers, and a few .45 handguns.* For a group of so-called scientists, most of the participants act in a very unscientific manner and take chances that are unacceptable. Of course this gives us the drama we are looking for, but a more clever film would not have it originate in the unscientific behavior of the scientists. For example, in the late 21st Century why are they walking without their helmets on into this unknown environment prior to the mapping technology completing the task. And where are the remote probes which exist in 2012 and by the end of the century will surely be more advanced?SPOILER ALERTS (if it's possible to ""spoil"" a terrible film)* There are many incredulous plot flaws. For example, the giant alien walks from his crashed space ship through the poisonous atmosphere to confront Dr. Shaw. But it's already been established that he can only breathe in the ""earth-like"" atmosphere in the cave; otherwise he needs a space suit which he leaves behind. How did he do it? Did he hold his breath? Think how big his ship was. How long would it take him to go from his gigantic ship to the survival vessel? How would he even know there was a survival vessel and where it was? etc.* Since the earth spaceship is equipped with a robotic medical center, why would the center be configured only for male patients, especially when Weyland's own daughter is aboard?* It's also been established in ""Alien"" that the big guy died in the command seat in his spaceship. So if he died elsewhere, who was in the seat? It was established that everyone else was dead. Or maybe there was another spaceship also with a giant engineer guiding it also equipped with alien creatures that also crashed? Yeah, maybe!* The robot chooses to kill Dr. Holloway by putting some alien substance in his drink, but there is no rationale for this since the robot's mission is to help Dr. Weyland meet the ""engineers"". Killing Dr. Holloway does not advance this agenda and in fact puts the mission at some peril since Holloway is a valued member of the crew.* As a prequel to ""Aliens"" there is an abominable discontinuation between that film and this one.  For example, there is a vast difference between the means of impregnation in this film (a gigantic creature) and the impregnation in ""Aliens"". What comes out is also vastly different.* If the start of the film is accurate, the alien engineers have enormous technological capabilities. They create the humans in our world with exquisite engineering. So why would they be wasting their time with the type of killing machine which the alien creature represents?The film isn't completely worthless and there are some nice touches here and there, like the sterile Shaw getting pregnant with an alien, or the mapping technology. But these are few and far between.Given the talent and resources that went into making this film, it's a big disappointment.",1,Insult to a sci fi classic,1339200000,"06 9, 2012",2012,4217,"['Prometheus', 'prequel', 'great', 'classic', 'sci', 'fi', 'film', 'Alien', '1979', 'out', 'explain', 'what', 'spaceship', 'was', 'doing', 'who', 'was', 'big', 'guy', 'driving', 'seat', 'what', 'alien', 'creatures', 'were', 'designed', 'film', 'pretty', 'job', 'objectives', 'rest', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'film', 'so', 'bad', 'hardly', 'know', 'where', 'begin', 'here', '*', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'old', 'man', 'makeup', 'old', 'man', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'old', 'man', 'makeup', 'Surely', 'plethora', 'old', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'excellent', 'actors', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'Ernie', 'Borgnine', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'one', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'chosen', 'writers', 'producers', 'had', 'real', 'imagination', 'how', 'old', 'woman', '*', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'Snow', 'White', 'Huntsman', 'could', 'say', 'was', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'worst', 'performance', 'date', 'simply', 'terrible', 'very', 'talented', 'actress', 'shown', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'none', 'apparent', 'here', '*', 'One', 'chief', 'virtues', 'Alien', 'sequels', 'was', 'dark', 'foreboding', 'almost', 'claustrophobic', 'atmosphere', 'brightness', 'film', 'stark', 'contrast', '*', 'space', 'ship', '2', 'year', 'mission', 'explore', 'alien', 'environment', 'stunning', 'lack', 'military', 'preparedness', 'Surely', 'end', '21st', 'Century', 'have', 'more', 'lethal', 'weapons', 'disposal', 'shotgun', '2', 'flame', 'throwers', 'few', '.45', 'handguns', '*', 'group', 'so-called', 'scientists', 'most', 'participants', 'act', 'very', 'unscientific', 'manner', 'take', 'chances', 'are', 'unacceptable', 'course', 'drama', 'are', 'looking', 'more', 'clever', 'film', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'originate', 'unscientific', 'behavior', 'scientists', 'example', 'late', '21st', 'Century', 'why', 'are', 'walking', 'helmets', 'unknown', 'environment', 'prior', 'mapping', 'technology', 'completing', 'task', 'where', 'are', 'remote', 'probes', 'exist', '2012', 'end', 'century', 'will', 'surely', 'be', 'more', 'advanced', 'SPOILER', 'ALERTS', 'possible', 'spoil', 'terrible', 'film', '*', 'are', 'many', 'incredulous', 'plot', 'flaws', 'example', 'giant', 'alien', 'walks', 'crashed', 'space', 'ship', 'poisonous', 'atmosphere', 'confront', 'Dr.', 'Shaw', 'already', 'been', 'established', 'can', 'only', 'breathe', 'earth-like', 'atmosphere', 'cave', 'otherwise', 'space', 'suit', 'behind', 'How', 'did', 'do', 'Did', 'hold', 'breath', 'Think', 'how', 'big', 'ship', 'was', 'How', 'long', 'would', 'take', 'go', 'gigantic', 'ship', 'survival', 'vessel', 'How', 'would', 'even', 'know', 'was', 'survival', 'vessel', 'where', 'was', 'etc', '*', 'earth', 'spaceship', 'equipped', 'robotic', 'medical', 'center', 'why', 'would', 'center', 'be', 'configured', 'only', 'male', 'patients', 'especially', 'when', 'Weyland', 'own', 'daughter', 'aboard', '*', 'also', 'been', 'established', 'Alien', 'big', 'guy', 'died', 'command', 'seat', 'spaceship', 'So', 'died', 'elsewhere', 'who', 'was', 'seat', 'was', 'established', 'everyone', 'else', 'was', 'dead', 'maybe', 'was', 'spaceship', 'also', 'giant', 'engineer', 'guiding', 'also', 'equipped', 'alien', 'creatures', 'also', 'crashed', 'Yeah', 'maybe', '*', 'robot', 'kill', 'Dr.', 'Holloway', 'putting', 'alien', 'substance', 'drink', 'rationale', 'robot', 'mission', 'help', 'Dr.', 'Weyland', 'meet', 'engineers', 'Killing', 'Dr.', 'Holloway', 'not', 'advance', 'agenda', 'fact', 'mission', 'peril', 'Holloway', 'valued', 'member', 'crew', 'prequel', 'Aliens', 'abominable', 'discontinuation', 'film', 'one', 'example', 'vast', 'difference', 'means', 'impregnation', 'film', 'gigantic', 'creature', 'impregnation', 'Aliens', 'What', 'out', 'also', 'vastly', 'different', '*', 'start', 'film', 'accurate', 'alien', 'engineers', 'have', 'enormous', 'technological', 'capabilities', 'create', 'humans', 'world', 'exquisite', 'engineering', 'why', 'would', 'be', 'wasting', 'time', 'type', 'killing', 'machine', 'alien', 'creature', 'film', ""n't"", 'completely', 'worthless', 'are', 'nice', 'touches', 'here', 'there', 'sterile', 'Shaw', 'getting', 'pregnant', 'alien', 'mapping', 'technology', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'between.Given', 'talent', 'resources', 'went', 'making', 'film', 'big', 'disappointment']",N/A
1475363,A1E6JS6C205VZD,B005LAIHXQ,Dr. Laurence Raw,"[0, 2]","Like many Scott buffs, I remember ALIEN (1979) as being one of the defining films in the late twentieth century horror canon.  The blend of horror and science fiction, coupled with some genuinely memorable sequences (for example, involving John Hurt), have remained with me throughout my career as moviegoer and sometime critic.  Likewise BLADE RUNNER, in all its versions, has always struck me as a film that defined the canon of science fiction films.  Having sat through two hours of PROMETHEUS, which doesn't so much revisit ALIEN as reproduce in many cases precisely the same sequences contained in the earlier film, I really wondered why Scott bothered to make it at all.

In other words, evil has always been with us.This movie takes 81 minutes before it becomes awesome - shoutworthy awesome.  Then the visuals and the surprise are so mindblowing that you don't mind the 81 minutes that you've lost and just love this movie.  They should definitely sell a version that has the first 81 minutes removable.Coincidentally,Alien vs. Predatortook 83 minutes to get good.  It seems that the Weyland in Prometheus is the descendant of the Weyland in Aliens vs. Predator.  Charlize Theron has a thankless very small part in this film and Idris Elba has a very fake corny accent.  Noomi Rapace is awful, just this mealy wife until 81 minutes in when she becomes awesome and she is completely forgiven forgotten for her unbelievable obviously younger husband who keeps calling her Babe as if to keep her attention as well as flaunt intimacy to embarrass her so as to keep her off balance and awkward.So this movie kind of sucks for the first 81 minutes and then it blooms into something amazing and hardcore trashtalking if you think it's not a coincidence that Fascist meets Sharktopus Rectum and make an Alien.You have to wonder at the uncredited cameo of shokushu goukan (poor Comfort Women and Joy Division) in this film and the obvious Vril-like excuse by the Weylanders for embarking on this mission.  I think its great that Ridley Scott brings the franchise full circle and expands it emotionally with this film makingAliensmore than a movie with clever one-liners and makes it likely that Bishop knocked out Reese, picked up Ripley and Newt LATE because he was picking up an egg sac and not because ""the platform looked unstable"" - what does flying away and coming back have to do with that? and infected Ripley in hypersleep with his bottom half missing.  He tells Ripley inAlien 3that the Alien was with them the whole time and that the Company knows everything that goes on - just like those black boxes in every Toyota vehicle.  Bishop's declaration about never going to be top notch ever again indicates that he was built to see himself as a real Weyland just like David is the closing thing to a son that Guy Pearce will ever have.German Michael Fassbender (raised in Ireland, summered back in Germany) imitates Peter O' Toole and rewatches Lawrence of Arabia to practice his delivery while his dye job sets in which might be the reason for that incredible false note when he puts his jacket around Noomi Rapacious's character even though he is the cause of her suffering.  VERY STRANGE and obviously a lack in understanding what he is imitating and a failure to watch IRISHMAN Peter O'Toole inRogue Maleboth as David the character and as himself the actor Michael Fassbender - it really makes you wonder why Quentin Tarantino cast him as the Englishman pretending to be German inInglourious Basterds.",5,The timeline totally works - SPOILERS,1374364800,"07 21, 2013",2013,3251,"['remember', 'Noomi', 'Rapace', 'character', 'opines', 'cave', 'paintings', 'are', 'least', '35,000', 'years', 'old', 'see', 'Engineer', 'when', 'world', 'was', 'new', 'beginning', 'film', 'when', 'own', 'dna', 'strands', 'imbibing', 'evil/seafood', 'dna', 'sense', 'earlier', 'missionaries', 'crashed', 'ships', 'should', 'appear', 'not', 'only', 'inAlienand', 'inAlien', 'vs.', 'Predatorand', 'home', 'base', 'should', 'be', 'discovered', 'film', 'other', 'words', 'evil', 'always', 'been', 'us.This', 'movie', '81', 'minutes', 'awesome', 'shoutworthy', 'awesome', 'Then', 'visuals', 'surprise', 'are', 'so', 'mindblowing', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', '81', 'minutes', ""'ve"", 'lost', 'just', 'love', 'movie', 'should', 'definitely', 'sell', 'version', 'first', '81', 'minutes', 'removable.Coincidentally', 'Alien', 'vs.', 'Predatortook', '83', 'minutes', 'get', 'good', 'Weyland', 'Prometheus', 'descendant', 'Weyland', 'Aliens', 'vs', 'Predator', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'thankless', 'very', 'small', 'part', 'film', 'Idris', 'Elba', 'very', 'fake', 'corny', 'accent', 'Noomi', 'Rapace', 'awful', 'just', 'mealy', 'wife', '81', 'minutes', 'when', 'awesome', 'completely', 'forgiven', 'forgotten', 'unbelievable', 'obviously', 'younger', 'husband', 'who', 'calling', 'Babe', 'keep', 'attention', 'as', 'well', 'flaunt', 'intimacy', 'embarrass', 'so', 'keep', 'off', 'balance', 'awkward.So', 'movie', 'kind', 'sucks', 'first', '81', 'minutes', 'then', 'something', 'amazing', 'hardcore', 'trashtalking', 'think', 'not', 'coincidence', 'Fascist', 'meets', 'Sharktopus', 'Rectum', 'make', 'Alien.You', 'have', 'wonder', 'uncredited', 'cameo', 'shokushu', 'goukan', 'poor', 'Comfort', 'Women', 'Joy', 'Division', 'film', 'obvious', 'Vril-like', 'excuse', 'Weylanders', 'embarking', 'mission', 'think', 'great', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'franchise', 'full', 'circle', 'emotionally', 'film', 'makingAliensmore', 'movie', 'clever', 'one-liners', 'likely', 'Bishop', 'knocked', 'out', 'Reese', 'picked', 'up', 'Ripley', 'Newt', 'LATE', 'was', 'picking', 'up', 'egg', 'sac', 'not', 'platform', 'looked', 'unstable', 'what', 'flying', 'away', 'coming', 'back', 'have', 'do', 'infected', 'Ripley', 'hypersleep', 'bottom', 'half', 'missing', 'Ripley', 'inAlien', '3that', 'Alien', 'was', 'whole', 'time', 'Company', 'everything', 'just', 'black', 'boxes', 'Toyota', 'vehicle', 'Bishop', 'declaration', 'never', 'going', 'be', 'top', 'notch', 'ever', 'again', 'was', 'built', 'see', 'real', 'Weyland', 'just', 'David', 'closing', 'thing', 'son', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'will', 'ever', 'have.German', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'raised', 'Ireland', 'summered', 'back', 'Germany', 'Peter', 'O', 'Toole', 'rewatches', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'practice', 'delivery', 'dye', 'job', 'sets', 'might', 'be', 'reason', 'incredible', 'false', 'note', 'when', 'jacket', 'Noomi', 'Rapacious', 'character', 'even', 'cause', 'suffering', 'VERY', 'STRANGE', 'obviously', 'lack', 'understanding', 'what', 'imitating', 'failure', 'watch', 'IRISHMAN', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'inRogue', 'Maleboth', 'David', 'character', 'actor', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'really', 'wonder', 'why', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'cast', 'Englishman', 'pretending', 'be', 'German', 'inInglourious', 'Basterds']",N/A

The product... very nice all around, though I don't think I will try out the Ultra-Violet due to the issues I've read on that technology.  It was an inclusion that was not a selling point for me, so no big deal.The movie:  Visuals and effects?  Incredible and satisfying, so nothing to fault there.  Character development?  Ok at best with Noomi and with the android, but silly and hokey at times inre to the rest of the crew.  Not too bad overall as this is an aggressive film where the action sequences that are shown and the build-up to them leaves little time for character development... so it ends up being rather laser chiseled in where it can.  The story?  Great premise, ambitious, but would be a better long novel instead of a 2 hour movie in the telling.  That being said, it is not too hard to see that this is the first of a trilogy unfolding, and not too difficult for the Alien/Sci-Fi Horror fan's mind to fill in.  You don't have to be the 'hardcore' Alien or Sci-Fi fan or purest to enjoy this movie, but go into it without constantly comparing it to the early Alien movie looking for pitfalls, nor go into it expecting (like the 'Thing' prequel to John Carpenter's the 'Thing' did pull off) that the end of this movie immediately leads in to the original 'Alien'.  There is still some evolution to go to get to that point, but this movie does waft of the essence of that evolution, and not too bad at all with subtle tie-ins to the Alien Universe that... in juxtiposed time... is yet to come.  Finally, the Horror?  Great!  Creepy!  New Creatures and even a Zombie!  I wonder if one of the creatures was an homage to the Lovecraft 'Cthulu'!  Yes, there is still a lot of the 'why do people always do the most illogical and against all common sense things' moments during the suspense, reminiscent of slasher movies everywhere... but all in all, with the pitfalls, the lapses, the holes, and other such things that people love to lambaste in reviews... I thought this movie was entertaining and satisfying for what it is... and can clearly see it as the first part of a longer story... or prequel... that will move us eventually forward... back to the Alien Universe we have come to know and love!Four stars simply because, imho, Charlize and Guy Pierce were completely wasted on this film.  Their characters were weak... too weak for their presence.  I believe it would have been better to get Lance Henricksen to play Wheylan (why not, as he appears in the Alien Universe more than any other actor outside of Sigourney), and someone like Mimi Rogers or some other recognizable name to play the cold hearted company gal.  I believe NOT having their names in the cast and credits would NOT have slowed the ticket sales, nor made any difference to anything in this film if less 'screen presence' actors were used.  I really like both of them, but was especially disappointed in the character Charlize portrayed.BTW...

Not only were the visuals stunning, the plot was interesting even if it was just another take on the ancient astronaut theory and the special effects were remarkable. I was expecting another crappy, mindless alien movie with nothing but a bunch of predictable mindless beasts lurking in the shadows waiting to pounce. I think a lot of nerdy fanboys got butthurt because it didn't turn out to be just that. Aliens have been done to death, brought back as a zombie and then done to death again and then some. I find it humorous that fanboys think the Alien films were wonderful and without plot holes and inconsistencies. The same basement dwelling virgins that have posters of Bladerunner on their walls forget that that film was also ripped to shreds by their ilk when it first came out. It wasn't until the director's cut came out and a few years had passed that it became a respected sci-fi classic. Fanboys are a lazy lot, want only mindless, nonstop action and just don't want to think. They want everything spoon-fed to them on a silver platter with nothing left to the imagination. Nerd fanboys are ruining chances of more great sci-fi movies being made because producers know fanboy losers will hang out in their darkened rooms and pick the movie to shreds frame by frame so they can go online and tear it a part in a vain attempt to sound smart when it just makes them look pathetic.

1475376,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B005LAIHXQ,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[5, 11]","""Prometheus"" is an ambitious movie -- it wants to answer (in a sci-fi way) the questions that have haunted humanity for eons.And... it doesn't. This sorta-kinda-maybe prequel to the ""Alien"" franchise raises a lot of scientific/philosophical questions and never really answers them. But if you can bypass that, it's still a very solid, harrowing sci-fi adventure, with some powerful lead performances and truly brilliant direction by Ridley Scott.Dr. Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and her partner Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) have discovered ancient star maps that may lead to the Engineers, aliens responsible for making the human race. So with the funding of elderly bazillionaire Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce), they set out to a remote moon on board the Prometheus.Upon landing, the crew finds a vast torc-shaped spaceship, filled with the dead bodies of Engineers. But there is also a bizarre black liquid that ravages anyone who is exposed to it -- and leaves Shaw threatened by a bizarre alien life form. As she discovers the ugly true reason behind the expedition, she also finds that the Engineers are not what she expected...""Prometheus"" can be kind of frustrating -- it has a lot of unanswered questions and dangling plot threads, and eventually it makes you feel like it's the first half of a two-part story. And there's a lot of scientific/philosophical/religious stuff that is lightly touched on, but isn't really handled in an insightful way (although it was nice to see a scientist who is also religious).But despite those flaws.... ""Prometheus"" is actually a really enjoyable movie. There's a lot of passion and earnest intensity to this movie, and it was clearly made with a lot of love.And Ridley Scott's direction is absolutely brilliant -- he interweaves slimy tentacled horror with sleek, shadowy sci-fi, until they are indistinguishable from each other. Everything grows more intense as the black liquid starts mutating the crew members, until the climax explodes into a chaos. Things just spiral more and more out of control, and you never quite know what's going to happen.You also wouldn't recognize Rapace as the girl with the dragon tattoo here -- she's elfin and luminous, with enormous expressive eyes and a mop of rumpled hair. She handles the role of Shaw beautifully -- a person who is deeply religious but also devoted to science, extremely intellectual but also very strong (particular in the... um, medical procedure scene).She's also flanked by awesome performances by the icy, rigid Charlize Theron and the pleasant, charming Idris Elba. But the scene-stealer is Fassbender, who plays a charming, elegant android who occasionally shows some flickers of human emotion. At times he seems soulless and cold, but then we see him watching his favorite movie or asking questions about faith.""Prometheus"" is a riveting sci-fi story, albeit a flawed one that never answers most of our questions.

It boasts two very talented actresses: Noomi Rapace, Lispeth Salander in the Millenium Trilogy, and Charlize Theron.  Viewers will recognize the alien spaceship, the command chair, and helmeted alien from the first Alien movie. The story, however, suffers from any number of ambiguities. I will accept a certain number of ambiguities, but the motivations of the characters should be reasonably understandable.  Kubrick achieved this in his masterpiece, ""2001, a Space Odyssey"". In that film, the meaning of the monolith and the Louis XVI bedroom are left to the viewer's imagination, but there was never any doubt about the character's motivations. In ""Prometheus"", what was the significance of the opening scene in which a character consumes some liquid, undergoes physical changes, and dies? What was his motivation? Why did the android put his finger with a drop of oily-looking fluid in the man's drink? What did he know? How did the crew come to understand so quickly that the canisters on the alien spaceship were WMD's targeted for earth? How did Dr. Shaw believe that the aliens had decided not to annihilate the the earth? One may infer that they all knew something, but whatever it was, I must have missed it.

I was waiting for another movie to start and I took a peek.  I was mesmerized by how visually stunning it looked.  I never got a chance to go back to see it, so I figured I would just buy it in 3D when it came out.  Sometimes you know you're going to love a movie before you even see it.  After some of the negative reviews I was even more fascinated.  The meaning of life connected to the ""Alien"" movies?  Wow!  It upset people because everything wasn't clearly explained.  I have to get this movie.  After viewing it I was exhilarated from the experience.  3D at it's best!  There are quite a few movies with 3D with cheezy in your face gimmicks.  If they did that with this movie the cheap distraction would cause a huge suspension of belief.  I drifted right into the screen.  The depth was enthralling!  It was like watching IMAX's ""Space Station"" and ""Hubble"" with a great suspenseful story.  I didn't want it to end.  I didn't expect it to be a shocker, like the other ""Alien"" movies.  It had that same intense prolonged suspense that ""Alien"" had.  I love ""Ancient Aliens"" and such subject matter.  So I was fascinated with the idea. What if at some point we actually found them?  What would we learn?  Would they be kind?  Could they help us understand our purpose?  Who made them? And so on.  This alone being the foundation for one of the best Sci-Fi movies ever made.  Time will tell when people stop scratching their heads.  I wasn't expecting the meaning of life to be revealed.  What was revealed made sense within the realm of the story itself.  With video you can go back and you can subtitle things you have trouble hearing and I found certain things could easily be missed with a straight non-stop viewing.  I can't wait to see it again and watch the 3 1/2 hour documentary.  I did watch the deleted scenes and understand why they were cut.  Great job Ridley Scott.  I would like to see this the beginning of what should end with ""Aliens"".  I'm sorry, like so many, I just didn't like the post ""Aliens"" movies.  You can probably pop in ""Alien"" after this one and find a flow, but I know there is more.  The tech in ""Alien"" seems older.  More like Prometheus without the touchscreen. Let's just say that crew got a second rate vessel because it wasn't as highly financed as the first.  Maybe for some reason certain technology plateau's at some point. The similiarities of the crafts are very obvious.  I love this movie and highly recommend it.  I have a feeling it will age very well and become a classic.

I think many have a problem because the role of God is left to our speculation, but this actually elevates Deity beyond human understanding--just where It should be. The feeling of aloneness this leaves makes us shudder before the Here and Now. Our immediate progenitors are spacemen who apparently have scorn for us and want to wipe us out, to denude Earth of human life. Strong as they are, they are mortal, and they can be eaten alive just as humans have been in previous Alien films by something they wished to use to wipe out humanity.Yes, humans perform some silly deeds in this film--just as humans often do. We wouldn't have tragedy if humans always acted  perspicaciously. The point is that we're human, and although we can be brilliant, we can also be very impulsive and foolish. I don't see that the plot shows anything other than human fallibility and a fragility of intellect under the pressure of emotions such as fear, lust for power and superiority and sexual abandon. Finally, we are led to ask why we are here, why our ""engineers"" (creators) have found us wanting and where do we go from here? Where are you, God? We need you!The 3-D is glorious, the effects stupendous. I couldn't have asked for more. I saw it with an adult goddaughter who had asked to see it, and she couldn't stop saying ""wow!"". I think that, if you've seen this in 2-D, you owe it to yourself to see it in 3-D. The PQ is sharp, clear, revealing of detail, and the audio is perfect.

In this case, the movie proved itself worthy, & I highly recommend it.Although I could give a detailed analysis of the characters, etc., I'll keep this part short & to the point.  ""Prometheus"" effectively combines science & philosophy with action & atmosphere. The characters are believable & relatable, & their personal evolution reflects the storyline's premise:  who are we?Mythologically, Prometheus was an immortal who gave fire to man & was subsequently persecuted for it by the gods.  Restrained to a rock, he suffered an unending ritual that allowed an eagle to eat his liver; every night his liver regenerated only to be eaten again the next day.  An immortal suffering for us . . . sound familiar?The way you choose to view this is dependent on your primary philosophy.  I find it interesting that (in the case of this film) these beings essentially provided the building blocks of our lives & then were equally ready to destroy us, essentially playing God.

1475405,A1AZ2GJ6S8SUCE,B005LAIHXQ,Elizabeth Kuntz,"[19, 49]","Prometheus is, without a doubt, one of the best movies of the year and of the decade. Not only is it part of a phenomenal, long-lived franchise that's loved by many, but it brings to light a story that existed longer than that of the Alien; the ""Space Jockey."" What was that thing sitting in the pilot's chair of the crashed alien ship? Well, thanks to Ridley's newest film, Prometheus, you learn just what it is, and more. Prometheus is a perfect installment into the Alien franchise and brings back the awesome might and terror of space exploration; it brings many answers Alien fans have been looking for, but it also brings to light new questions as to what the universe has to offer, along the scale of godly, apocalyptic and unfathomable.Ridley's directing for this film was absolutely spectacular; he takes the shots that seem to be impossible for other filmmakers to get, and then adds on to that with even more heart-stopping visuals and sequences that defy imagination. The acting was superb; i think everyone already knows that the star who steals the show is Michael Fassbender as David, the new android created by Peter Weyland (played by Guy Pearce) who is very mischievous and mysterious at the same time. Noomi Rapace was great as Shaw, one of the scientists who co-discovers the ""invitation"" by the aliens, with the other scientist being played by Logan Marshall-Green as Holloway, who is very believable on screen. My favorite i would have to say is Idris Elba as Janek, the pilot of Prometheus because, when the situation gets ""hairy,"" he's one of the very few who knows what they should do; flee. The score was ominous and incredible; Marc Streitenfeld really knows what to do when it comes to film scores, with harry Gregson-Williams helping with two of the tracks. Last but not least, the visual effects; they were, not only better than Avatar, but there was not a moment when i thought it was CG. Ridley was a genius when it came to this; Alien used realistic practical effects with some CG to give the feel of sci-fi, but Prometheus did the opposite, and it works.All in all, Prometheus is an instant classic that falls short of being just as good as Alien, but just as good as James Cameron's Aliens.

Prometheus is one of those movies that is hyped beyond expectation, literally. The hype for this movie was too high, and unfortunately left many disappointed. I didn't have any real expectation or idea of what the movie was going to be like, but I was pleasantly surprised of how good this movie is. The acting is superb from all actors. The main character, Shaw, really gave this movie that needed thrill and horror factor. Shaw goes through absolutely hell before she gets off that damn planet. She survived an attack against a 8ft tall humanoid, and had to surgically remove an alien feeding off of her womb while conscious. While she tries to survive with a stapled stomach. Noomi really gave us that amazing acting to give us anxiety and make us cringe of the horrors she was going through. All characters had their own personality. Charlize was pure evil, but her evil is more of a survival instinct. The ""space jockey"" is really creepy and demonic looking, which makes ""him"" look really intimidating and scary, which is the point. The visuals are amazing and huge in scale. I paid attention to certain details of the characters. For example, Shaw was a believer in God, and it was very interesting how battling against an alien made her faith in God even stronger. I am excited of how the home world of the ""space jockey""/aliens will look like, and what the next explorers or Shaw will discover. My favorite elements of the movie are the small things in the characters, like Shaw's faith, and how the captain of prometheus was really dedicated to not transport death to earth, and how charlize's character is somewhat mean and cold because her father treated her that same way. Very good movie, and may not be for everyone.

1475411,A3V4ZFNKJ21P1M,B005LAIHXQ,Endless Kitchen,"[0, 0]","In 2089, the Weyland corporation sponsors archaeologists, including Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green), who discover celestial maps on ancient walls in Scottish caves that match those in other ancient ruins around the world. Following these maps, an advanced spaceship called ""Prometheus"" travels across galaxies in a four-year span to reach a distant moon that matches the ancient maps. Among the crew of this ship is an all-purpose android named David (Michael Fassbender) whose intellect is nearly perfect and has immense capabilities and perhaps a growing sense of self. There is also a sage but salty captain, Janek (Idris Alba), a naively friendly biologist (Rafe Spall), a grumpy geologist (Sean Harris) and a corporate micro-manager, Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron). The exact mission of Prometheus is unknown as the initial thesis behind these suspected maps, that they were extraterrestrials who visited Earth thousands of years ago, may be the starting point of surprising and horrifying truths. To make things even more mysterious, we occasionally see hologram messages of the late, enigmatic Mr. Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce) himself. What exactly is on the mysterious moon and why did the Weyland Corporation spend trillions on this voyage? Where will the search for the truth lead them?Prometheus is a semi-prequel and sidequel to its director's, Ridley Scott, 1979 film Alien. The film is very well-paced and it hooked me from the start. Scott still has his directing magic and the editing and cinematography are top-notch. Despite the alien moon being a gloomy and creepy place, the gray, purple and desert landscapes and skys are gorgeous. Like the original film Alien, the special effects, set pieces, costumes and props are imaginative and an interesting blend of modernism and futurism. Fear not, the unique, influencing styles of H.R. Giger are still to be found throughout the film. While the film was excellent in many technical ways, I was very disappointed by much of the story and some of the acting.Prometheus is a film Scott has tried to create for years and production began in 2009. Jon Spaihts developed an outline and rough draft of the script. Spaihts leaked script shows a much more explained and nuanced story as well as character development then the final product. Co-writer Damon Lindelof might be the reason behind the perplexing elements of the film. For instance, the protagonist Elizabeth Shaw was a well written, interesting character who was smart, strong and curious but she orders the crew to do something monumentally stupid shortly after Prometheus lands on the moon. In fact, there are a lot of horror film cliches where people (educated professional people, in this case) do things so ridiculously dumb even a sea sponge would know not to do. This is just poor writing.Still, this was a very good film with some memorable highlights. An unforgettable sequence unfolds at about seventy-three minutes into the film involving striking holograms; it is something like a gorgeously alien planetarium. I also enjoyed the authentic usage of Proto-Indo-European in the film; a nice touch by Scott and the other filmmakers in getting the details right rather than using gibberish or linguistic unobtainium. Michael Fassbender is given a very interesting role as an android who looks just like a man and mimics the feelings and expressions of people perfectly. Like a replicant, he has a fascinating emotional state as his mimicry might at some point in the journey have developed into an actual ego. Fassbender's performance is impeccable here. Rapace, Pearce, Alba and Theron all do well in their roles but the clear weak link is Logan Marshall-Green. His performance is closer to a drunken fratboy whose matriculation was due to his father being the dean than an actual archeaologist. Denise Richards was far more convincing as nuclear scientist Dr. Christmas Jones in The World Is Not Enough than Marshall-Green was here. That is saying a lot. For those who enjoyed the horror of the Aliens series, there are some very intense and squeamish scenes. Those who are a bit sensitive to body horror and gore might want to close their eyes during some scenes in Prometheus.I do not see the problem with the open-ended and unanswered questions in Prometheus. The film was designed to be the first in a trilogy, and great science fiction and pensive fictions require such questions to ask of its audience. The overall experience of Prometheus is dreamy, nearly surreal, with the great mysteries touched upon but only superficially addressed. This film fall far short of the truly great and cerebral, philosophical science fiction films such as Blade Runner, 2001: A Space Oydessy and Metropolis. Prometheus was entertaining and, at times, horrifying and scary. I appreciate the fact that Prometheus provided some amazing sights and entertaining mysteries, and it loosely had some heavy themes but it could have been a lot better without the plotholes. The sights and sounds of the film wowed me, but the story's flaws are unfortunately present.",4,"Good movie, much more entertaining if you ignore the plot holes",1357257600,"01 4,

1475413,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B005LAIHXQ,Enjolras,"[13, 20]","Many have described Prometheus as Ridley Scott's attempt to take Alien to the level of Kubrick's Space Odyssey: 2001, and I think that's broadly a good assessment. However, while I found the film enjoyable, it never quite reaches the heights of either of its spiritual predecessors.MINOR SPOILERS BELOWWhen I first heard about the concept of aliens creating men, I was worried. However, it's important not to take the science in the film too seriously. Even Ridley Scott says this isn't a science class. It is kind of silly that these large humanoid aliens called the ""Engineers"" (or Space Jockeys for fans of the original Alien) created humans. The film even points out the ridiculousness of the concept when the biologist jokes it would throw out ""300 years of Darwinism."" In watching the movie, it becomes clear pretty quickly that the plot is a device to answer philosophical questions about the nature of God, creation, and death. The atmosphere and story during the first half of the movie is great.The acting is also surprisingly good. Other reviewers have gone on about how good the big three - Michael Fassbender, Noomi Rapace, and Charlize Theron - are, so all I'll say is that I really enjoyed their performances. Fassbender's performance as the android is stunning in how calmly chilling he is. Some of his lines were so cruel, yet so innocently recited, that I want to rematch the movie just to see him. Most of the other characters I thought were fine, with some exceptions (particularly Noomi Rapace's character's husband who came off as a lame Ashton Kutcher wannabe).The problem with the movie is that its exploration of these themes and acting are hampered by action/horror scenes that clearly weren't well thought out. As other reviewers noted, many of the deaths are caused by characters making stupid decisions. Many reviewers have criticized the crew for taking off their helmets, which at first is fine because one would expect that alien microbes would not be able to infect humans. However, once it was apparent that the Space Jockey DNA was the same as humans AND that one of the crew members was infected, they still continue to take their helmets off! Other stupid decisions include the biologist's attempt to pet a snake; the captain's decision to open the ship's door when a crew member's signal is detected without receiving audio confirmation from him; and the fact that the characters can only run straight to avoid a rolling ship. Overall, the action scenes seem like they were a symptom of today's brain dead Hollywood.For me, the biggest drawback to the movie was pacing. The beginning was slow, which was fine by me. However, when the action starts, it never really slows down. The audience isn't given time to breathe and absorb. The tension never really builds. For example, after Noomi Rapace's infamous scene, she runs down the hallways and has a conversation with the crew, and then they go try to communicate with the Space Jockeys. First of all, the fact that Rapace's character doesn't even inform the other crew members about what happened to her is ridiculous. But then the movie switches gears so quickly that it's like it never happened. Rapace's character is clearly hurting from the encounter, but not as much as she probably would in real life.Another major problem is that the film leaves a lot of questions unanswered. I'm not an Alien fanboy - I don't need to know every detail about the Space Jockey's origins. However, major plot points that are (deliberately) left open, setting it up for a sequel. I like some mystery, but for most viewers the movie will seem incomplete or ridiculous. For example, as many other reviewers have noted, it seems pretty stupid for one of the Space Jockey's, presumably an intelligent alien species, to simply start killing humans, arguably an intelligent species, when he wakes up after sleeping for 2,000 years. The film hints that there might be a reason why the Space Jockeys hate humans so much, but you'd think he would at least be confused at seeing humans or worried that they were able to travel so far. As it is the Space Jockey's actions look more like Hollywood's attempt to throw in some mindless violence. Maybe it'll all make sense after we see the inevitable sequel, but too much of it just doesn't seem to have been thought through very clearly.Overall, if you like sci-fi, especially the Alien franchise, Prometheus is well worth seeing. Don't set your expectations too high, and be willing to accept some thoughtless plot points. I'd give the movie 3 stars. If Ridley Scott and his scriptwriters had put a bit more thought into the plot, it could have been so much more.UPDATE on Blu-Ray (10/15/12):My initial review was a bit harsh, but upon rewatching the movie I think it was eminently justified. While there are some interesting philosophical concepts, they're buried deep beneath stupid characters and poor scriptwriting. The contrast with Scott's Alien, which I also recently rewatched, is telling. Alien never pulled me out of the movie and the characters seemed utterly believable. It's just a shame Prometheus didn't quite work on that level.The blu-ray set comes with all the standard deleted scenes, making-of documentaries, and commentaries. The deleted scenes are definitely the highlight. As happens so often, I wonder why they were deleted. The deleted version of the Fiefield fight uses a much more interesting Fiefield monster concept than the ugly guy we saw in the film. Also, Vickers has a few compelling character moments in the deleted scenes. Even the Engineer has more character. The deleted scene gives him a very compelling reason for attacking the Promtheus crew, whereas in the finished film he seems like a mindless brute. In short, Prometheus would have been a much better movie with these scenes incorporated.The 4-disc set comes with even more impressive special features, particularly the 3-hour ""The Furious Gods"". This is the documentary that the ads claim will ""answer"" the questions left from the film's plot holes. While that goes a bit too far, ""The Furious Gods"" is rich in content. I enjoyed hearing about the making of the movie, from beginning to end. It is definitely revealing, both in good ways and bad, However, I really don't like the idea of ""enhancement pods"", which essentially require you to interrupt the documentary in order to watch shorter featurettes. I'd have preferred if the short featurettes were simply part of the feature documentary.",4,"Generally strong, except for a few of the action/horror scenes",1339286400,"06 10,

It's fair to say that my and others expectations were set too high.But let's look at reality for a moment. There were only two good Alien movies. Namely Alien and Aliens. Everything since then has been a creative failure. Partly that's because the alien xenomorph itself is the epitome of a one note villain. There's really nothing extra to explore. No motivations, no morals.Prometheus is in many ways an attempt to move onto fresh ground and maybe find out what else there is to see in this universe.At it's core Prometheus is a simple movie. Much like Alien and Aliens before it, there's a very basic action/horror premise in a remote and isolated location.. And when it focuses on that it works.But the problem is that Prometheus desperately wants to be more. It's a creation tale. It's a moral about biological weapons. It's about faith. And all of that really weighs down the early parts of the movie.It's trying to do so many things at once, that several of the characters really never get the development they deserve.But for all that, once it gets going it really never lets up. There are some strong central characters (particularly Michael Fassbender's android) that are easily capable of carrying the action forward. The visuals are, naturally, stunning. And it does carry a lot of the feel of the original Alien movie.So a qualified success then.

Do I call out the haters and point out that the bulk of their complaints were based on the movie not being what they thought it'd be? What about the epic 7.1 soundtrack and score? The ferocious Noomi Rapace? The synthetic David? The fact that the Prometheus ship looks like a Firefly on steroids? There are a few hundred reviews that wrongly wax on plot elements and acting. Here's the film AND the BD review:This IS an ALIEN movie. We are watching the start of it all. While the film takes place in the same meta-plot, it is easy to see the creatures presented being some how related to xenomorphs... maybe with a dose or two of Cthulhu mentality - tentacles a plenty.  The BD release has some great features by way of deleted scenes (some that might have done better to have been kept in the film), commentary tracks (Ridley Scott pretty much narrates the film, but it's not as bad as it sounds; he gets really excited about this film), and a background featurette that focuses on Wayland. The visuals are amazing on an up-to-date BD player, and as I said, we get the treat of 7.1 (which shook my apartment, literally, at normal volumes; so be mindful of the volume unless you want your photos and whatnots to get shaken off the walls at what you might consider a 'normal' volume). It's overpowering at points, but it sounds great despite the heft of it.Enjoy this for what it is - a long awaited reunion to the Alien epic universe. We're just going to be experiencing some elements that were never covered in the Alien franchise. Where does that leave us?Where else, but in the trusted hands of Mr. Ridley Scott. It seems this new trilogy is going to answer more than the questions left open by the film Prometheus. We're getting to see some answers that have gone unanswered for over 30 years. Key word there - some.I've waited this long; the promise of two more films in this series have me waiting, hopeful, that Mr. Scott can deliver the next movies on the same level that is Prometheus.

But I am not able to do that.Can you accept the premise that a super-rich mogul would spend a ""trillion dollars"" to finance an expedition to an earth-like planet in search of ancient astronauts who might, just might, have been the parents of the human race? Fine. Then can you accept that for this trillion dollar mission they would pick the most unprofessional, unscientific, incautious staff who proceed to ignore every sound principle of archaeological investigation, lab quarantine, and common sense?If you can't accept supposedly educated, trained, technically skilled people doing one moronic and dangerous thing after another, then about halfway through this film you just might be fighting the urge to throw heavy objects at the screen, or bang your head against the wall.On the other hand, if you enjoy typical horror films where people, through their typically unthinking behavior, put themselves in greater and greater danger and end up running from said danger until they meet with dismemberment and death, this is the sci-fi equivalent.This is a blot on Ridley Scott's filmography. Also, the slipcover on the DVD claims that Roger Ebert rated this four stars and called it ""magnificent."" If this is not an out-of-context quote, it is another sign that Roger Ebert's opinion is no longer of any use to the movie going public.The special effects are indeed magnificent.

1475426,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,B005LAIHXQ,Erik North,"[8, 14]","The 1979 film ALIEN took the modern-day lead in alien invasion and/or possession movies with some fairly gruesome special effects (remember the alien bursting through John Hurt's chest?), and making it so that any film of this sort more or less has had to utilize those same methods from that point on, with the most noticeable example being John Carpenter's 1982 opus THE THING.  And now, in a new century, thirty-three years after that huge box office achievement, ALIEN (and BLADE RUNNER) director Ridley Scott has returned to this theme with PROMETHEUS.Named for the Greek god who stole and gave the gift of fire and was cast out from Mount Olympus, the spaceship ""Prometheus"" and her crew are venturing through the galaxy to find the origins of the strange lights in the sky that ancient Earth civilizations, including the Egyptians and the Mayans, reputedly saw some thirty-five thousand years before--an idea floated around by theologian Erich von Daniken.  When they arrive on a planet hundreds of billions of miles from Earth, they find evidence of this in a huge hollow mountain on the surface.  Unfortunately, what they also find is that this alien presence is extremely hostile; and one by one, they die very horrible deaths.  In between, they come to realize that these aliens are actually intent on hitching a ride on ""Prometheus"" and coming to Earth in order to either destroy or possess every living human being there.  In doing so, they have to sacrifice themselves, often in the most horrible ways; and in the end, one of the female crew members (Noomi Repace), who had initially been infected and impregnated by one of the alien beings, manages to escape the planet in one of the various spaceships left over from the alien race.  But there's something she doesn't know yet....Although he had done some impressive work following BLADE RUNNER, including GLADIATOR, BLACK HAWK DOWN, BLACK RAIN, and 1492: CONQUEST OF PARADISE, Scott had been basically been overshadowed by his younger brother Tony, who co-produced PROMETHEUS with him, David Giler, and Walter Hill (the last two the original co-producers of ALIEN), and had upped the hyper-directional stakes with 2004's MAN ON FIRE and the 2009 reworking of 1974's THE TAKING OF PELHAM ONE-TWO-THREE.  In essence, Ridley was going back to the basic premise of ALIEN, so much to the point that it could be argued that basically PROMETHEUS itself is a basic reworking of ALIEN, with a ""Chariots Of The Gods"" plot thrown in, and some up-to-date and extremely graphic alien special effects.  The crew of ""Prometheus"" here is far less well known than the cast that comprised the crew of ""Nostromo"" in ALIEN; only Charlize Theron, who had won an Oscar in 2003 for portraying a serial killer in MONSTER, and Guy Pearce, who was in the 1997 film noir hit L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, have any real ""name value."" As a result, whatever success PROMETHEUS can claim, though it is substantial, must rest on how well the entire cast, the gruesome plot, and Scott's direction hold up under very close scrutiny.  In general, Scott is a fairly classical director, relying more on what he learned from masters like Stanley Kubrick and Orson Welles than his younger brother, who has taken the MTV ""splinters to the brain"" style of direction to new highs and lows, this in spite of the many special visual effects, and the many ultra-gory make-up effects sequences as well.Given how many dozens of alien invasion movies there have been since he made ALIEN, one wouldn't understand what more Scott could do to make PROMETHEUS really stand out.  And in truth, he really doesn't.  But the one thing he does different from most alien invasion films is that he is given a good plot outline from Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof (based on unused elements from the original Dan O'Bannon/Ronald Shusett script for ALIEN), a good cast, and credible production values, the kind that somehow seem to fly out the window in most blockbuster films because of the need to concentrate on spectacle.  Therefore, despite some imperfections and a lot of gruesomeness, PROMETHEUS succeeds better than most others of its kind today.",4,Ridley Scott Returns To Familiar ALIEN Territory,1339632000,"06 14, 2012",2012,4148,"['1979', 'film', 'ALIEN', 'took', 'modern-day', 'lead', 'alien', 'invasion', 'possession', 'movies', 'fairly', 'gruesome', 'special', 'effects', 'remember', 'alien', 'bursting', 'John', 'Hurt', 'chest', 'making', 'so', 'film', 'sort', 'more', 'less', 'had', 'utilize', 'same', 'methods', 'point', 'most', 'noticeable', 'example', 'being', 'John', 'Carpenter', '1982', 'THING', 'now', 'new', 'century', 'thirty-three', 'years', 'huge', 'box', 'office', 'achievement', 'ALIEN', 'BLADE', 'RUNNER', 'director', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'returned', 'theme', 'PROMETHEUS.Named', 'Greek', 'god', 'who', 'stole', 'gave', 'gift', 'fire', 'was', 'cast', 'out', 'Mount', 'Olympus', 'spaceship', 'Prometheus', 'crew', 'are', 'venturing', 'galaxy', 'find', 'origins', 'strange', 'lights', 'sky', 'ancient', 'Earth', 'civilizations', 'including', 'Egyptians', 'Mayans', 'reputedly', 'saw', 'thirty-five', 'thousand', 'years', 'before', 'idea', 'floated', 'theologian', 'Erich', 'von', 'Daniken', 'When', 'arrive', 'planet', 'hundreds', 'billions', 'miles', 'Earth', 'find', 'evidence', 'huge', 'hollow', 'mountain', 'surface', 'Unfortunately', 'what', 'also', 'find', 'alien', 'presence', 'extremely', 'hostile', 'one', 'one', 'die', 'very', 'horrible', 'deaths', 'come', 'realize', 'aliens', 'are', 'actually', 'intent', 'hitching', 'ride', 'Prometheus', 'coming', 'Earth', 'order', 'destroy', 'possess', 'living', 'human', 'being', 'there', 'doing', 'so', 'have', 'sacrifice', 'often', 'most', 'horrible', 'ways', 'end', 'one', 'female', 'crew', 'members', 'Noomi', 'Repace', 'who', 'had', 'initially', 'been', 'infected', 'impregnated', 'one', 'alien', 'beings', 'escape', 'planet', 'one', 'various', 'spaceships', 'left', 'over', 'alien', 'race', 'something', ""n't"", 'know', 'yet', 'had', 'done', 'impressive', 'work', 'following', 'BLADE', 'RUNNER', 'including', 'GLADIATOR', 'BLACK', 'HAWK', 'DOWN', 'BLACK', 'RAIN', '1492', 'CONQUEST', 'PARADISE', 'Scott', 'had', 'been', 'basically', 'been', 'overshadowed', 'younger', 'brother', 'Tony', 'who', 'co-produced', 'PROMETHEUS', 'David', 'Giler', 'Walter', 'Hill', 'last', 'two', 'original', 'co-producers', 'ALIEN', 'had', 'upped', 'hyper-directional', 'stakes', '2004', 'MAN', 'ON', 'FIRE', '2009', 'reworking', '1974', 'THE', 'TAKING', 'OF', 'PELHAM', 'ONE-TWO-THREE', 'essence', 'Ridley', 'was', 'going', 'back', 'basic', 'premise', 'ALIEN', 'so', 'much', 'point', 'could', 'be', 'argued', 'basically', 'PROMETHEUS', 'basic', 'reworking', 'ALIEN', 'Chariots', 'Gods', 'plot', 'thrown', 'up-to-date', 'extremely', 'graphic', 'alien', 'special', 'effects', 'crew', 'Prometheus', 'here', 'far', 'less', 'well', 'known', 'cast', 'comprised', 'crew', 'Nostromo', 'ALIEN', 'only', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'who', 'had', 'won', 'Oscar', '2003', 'portraying', 'serial', 'killer', 'MONSTER', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'who', 'was', '1997', 'film', 'hit', 'L.A', 'CONFIDENTIAL', 'have', 'real', 'name', 'value', 'result', 'success', 'PROMETHEUS', 'can', 'claim', 'substantial', 'must', 'rest', 'how', 'well', 'entire', 'cast', 'gruesome', 'plot', 'Scott', 'direction', 'hold', 'up', 'very', 'close', 'scrutiny', 'general', 'Scott', 'fairly', 'classical', 'director', 'relying', 'more', 'what', 'learned', 'masters', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'younger', 'brother', 'who', 'taken', 'MTV', 'splinters', 'brain', 'style', 'direction', 'new', 'highs', 'lows', 'spite', 'many', 'special', 'visual', 'effects', 'many', 'ultra-gory', 'make-up', 'effects', 'sequences', 'well.Given', 'how', 'many', 'dozens', 'alien', 'invasion', 'movies', 'there', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'ALIEN', 'one', 'would', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'more', 'Scott', 'could', 'do', 'make', 'PROMETHEUS', 'really', 'stand', 'out', 'truth', 'really', ""n't"", 'one', 'thing', 'different', 'most', 'alien', 'invasion', 'films', 'given', 'good', 'plot', 'outline', 'Jon', 'Spaihts', 'Damon', 'Lindelof', 'based', 'unused', 'elements', 'original', 'Dan', ""O'Bannon/Ronald"", 'Shusett', 'script', 'ALIEN', 'good', 'cast', 'credible', 'production', 'values', 'kind', 'somehow', 'seem', 'fly', 'out', 'window', 'most', 'blockbuster', 'films', 'need', 'concentrate', 'spectacle', 'Therefore', 'imperfections', 'lot', 'gruesomeness', 'PROMETHEUS', 'better', 'most', 'others', 'kind', 'today']",N/A

For me there are 2 Alien movies, Alien and Aliens. The others I don't bother with and of the first two I really like the directors commentary on the first.So when Scott announced he would be making this I was delighted. Then came promising trailers and viral trailers like Guy Pearce in the Peter Wayland TED viral or Fassbender in the David 8 trailer are terrific (both can be found on youtube). So it looked very good.It isn't very good. It isn't even good. It is a mess.The film starts o.k. but very quickly goes past the point of reasonable disbelief. Lets enter orbit of a planet in the hope of finding a landing place (rather than find one from orbit) and this group of scientist act about as rationally as a group of highschool kids if you set them on a space voyage for spring break. Regularily something new is thrown in to keep tension in the film without ever resolving what had happened previously. And this goes on and on until it is a mess. Even the characters became one dimensional wrecks. Although an abdominal cesarean of a large alien didn't prevent them from running around with a few staples. Well admittedly Noomi Rapace does cry after the operation but then again she cries a lot - so much for Scott's strong female lead.Of course if you set out with the promise of finding ""the answer to life the universe and everything"" - you will fail to deliver since Ridley simply can't.By the end I was more excited to see the movie finish rather than wait for another new twist and I was hugely disappointed. they had the budget, they had the actors and they had Scott so whiskey tango foxtrot went wrong?I had to look it up on IMdB and there it was crystal clear. Damon Lindelof is what is wrong. If you don't know who he is then he wrote Lost, a series that lived up to its title. And it all falls into place. Prometheus is no more a prequel to Alien than it is 42 episodes of Lost squeezed into a feature film. Constantly being bombarded with new events without resovling a thing = LOST. Characters behaving unbelievably unrationally and ever more so = LOST.So this prequel falls into place with Aliens3 and Alien: Resurrection and is in fact probaly worse than those two bad as they were.",2,It isn't very good.

1475487,A16FUU8WW76QFY,B005LAIHXQ,gork57,"[5, 8]","The controversy and criticism of ""Prometheus"" pretty much centers on two things: 1. Movie fans expected a straight-up ""Alien"" prequel, complete with queens, face-huggers, and worker aliens, and 2. The film does not have a neatly laid out, simplistic plot like the usual fare we see nowadays. Director Ridley Scott decided to go his own way, not taking the easy and simple route. The result is a masterpiece of mystery and questions. Lost by the critics is Scott's examination of human nature and the desire for absolute power and immortality contained within the search for our origins.Prometheus asks big questions about the creation of life on Earth, as well as what might be out there in deep space beyond our present technological capabilities. Human civilization has existed for a mere few thousand years, but the universe is billions of years old. The foolish belief by many of us today that we somehow have it all figured out is exemplified in the film by the monumental hubris of Peter Weyland, who selfishly set up the expedition to somehow cheat death-and to profit by whatever else it found.The fact that the Engineers in Prometheus were able to create magnificent technologies on such a vast scale only amplifies the mysteries of what we don't know. The universe is vast beyond our comprehension, and the world Ridley Scott creates in this film, with it's monsters, spacecraft, and buildings reinforce his plot device. The ending of the film, with the robot David and Dr. Shaw leaving LV-223 in the Engineer spacecraft, tells us in no uncertain terms that there remains a great deal still to be discovered.Think about it! Humanity has only begun to scratch the surface of space travel; we've only landed a few men on the moon, and the sum total of our exploration beyond that is limited to our own solar system-which constitutes a tiny portion of the Milky Way galaxy. We humans are like a speck of sand on the shores of a vast ocean-but one must remember it was only a few centuries ago that we thought Earth was the center of the universe!It takes a bit more than Transformers or the Avengers (which is a good movie for its intended audience) to touch on the kind of questions Scott is tackling here. He assumes his audience will consider the questions his film is asking. Many critics condemned ""2001"" and the original ""Alien"" for the very same things people are saying now; they weren't easy to understand, they didn't fit into established categories, etc.""Prometheus"" thus fits into something the ancient Greek philosopher Socrates said 2400 years ago: ""I know nothing except the fact of my own ignorance."" Scott asked us to open our minds, and see beyond the usual formula stuff. It seems some lack the imagination to follow where he leads. That's okay.

While the movie was visually appealing (it looked pretty amazing in point of fact) the story seemed rushed. Almost as if it could have benefited from an extra 30 minutes of scenes added in (I can only assume the typical Hollywood Dougs didn't think people would wanna watch a 3 plus hour long movie) to stretch out the story better and make things seem less like happenstance. I thought the premise and concept were great, I thought the effects and design were great, I just think the execution was not great. It seemed like something was missing, and even though I found the movie enjoyable and a good modern horror sci-fi film much in the vein of Alien, I think this movie could have used an extended cut to draw out sequences and segue one scene to the next more smoothly as I felt some of the transitions were choppy. I could even see this being better as a 6 episode miniseries as the concept was to big for the length of the film. On Blu-Ray, Twentieth Century Fox puts out another immaculate transfer of a movie, it pops onscreen and is one of the best and most detailed releases I've seen to date. And with a 3 and a half hour making of, the special features are great. Well worth the $25 bucks. Aside from the pacing problems, I wish the design was a bit more plain and a bit more 1970's like Alien. Although I really like the design in this movie, in Alien the computer screens were green and simple (because that's what computers looked like in 1979 and movie magic couldn't really enhance that like it can today since the advent of CGI) and costumes weren't as sleek as this movie which makes some distance between them, continuity wise.

The visuals are very impressive and detailed, with effective blending of CGI and practical sets.  The performances are really strong all around and the general pacing and atmosphere and things like that are all effective and evenly laid out.  It's so technically strong that it makes the absolute insanity and inconsistencies in the script and story really, really standout.  It's not a fun movie.  It's an impressive movie, but certainly not a fun one, and I wouldn't really know who to recommend it to.  It's not good sci-fi, because there are too many plot and logic holes.  It's certainly not a horror film, though it pretends to be one every so often.  I suppose it's more of an action/thriller?I guess the bottom line is, so long as you're not looking for anything that makes sense, you'll be okay.  It sounds weird to say that, because we all assume that we're want things to make sense, but...  I guess if you really, really liked Lost, and didn't care that it turned out to be made up on the fly, you might really get off on Prometheus.Mostly it's a visually impressive mess; a mediocre-to-bad script with excellent performances.And the occasional penis snake.Let's cut this thing open, shall we?****HEAVY SPOILERS!  SUPER HEAVY SPOILERS!  I'M SERIOUSLY!*****Okay, so the basic plot of the movie is this: Some archeologists... or space archeologists or whatever... find various evidence that points to a planet where they believe the aliens who created human life may have come from.  Old Man Guy Pearce hears about this and funds a trillion dollar expedition to go to the planet to meet the creators because it would be awesome and because maybe they can keep him from dying from horrible old-age makeup.  Once they get there they do find their creators, but also find out that said creators seem to hate humans and had been planning on wiping us all out with a super weapon (super-gross weapon, actually) before they accidentally killed themselves with that same weapon.  It's left unclear whether all of the creators (or ""engineers"" as they call them because it sound more differenter) died out or whether they just gave up on the whole attack earth thing and our surviving protagonist hijacks an alien ship with her bodyless robot friend to try and found out.I actually, really like that plot.  That's a neat story.  The problem comes from all the BS they layer on top of and around that story to pad it out to beyond necessary lengths.  It's such an awkward and stupid script; I'm not sure where to begin.There's a whole subplot with the android, David (played by Magneto), starts messing around with this Black Goo they find.Now, there's a bit in the beginning where an alien drinks the Black Goo and melts... which is not what the Black Goo (or BG, as I call it for no reason) does later, but whatever.So, the scientists science it a little bit and sort of off-handedly decide its some kind of weapon.  David steals a jar of it, brings it on the ship, and secretly feeds it to the head scientist... for some reason.  It's heavily implied that Old Man Pearce asked him to do this during a clandestine meeting (while Old Man Pearce is faking his death for some reason; a ruse that fools exactly zero people in the audience).  The BG winds up making the head scientist really sick, but not until the next day and not until after he's had sex with Scientist hot-pants.  So he dies and she gets pregnant with an alien monster baby that almost kills her.  Magneto tells her about it after examining her, but then says that she shouldn't have the monster surgically removed, but instead should just go be re-frozen.  Hot Pants puts herself into an auto-surgeon 9000 and the movie turns into torture porn for a bit as the rapidly growing alien squid thing gets removed from her gut, c-sections style. ...in her defense, she takes it pretty well and is running and climbing in about twenty minutes time.  Also, that squid thing just sort of hangs out in there until the end of the movie, when it's grown into a nine-foot long version of the facehugger from Alien.  Oh, also, the BG turns a different guy into a murderous zombie... somehow.  Also another guy tries to pet a hissing alien penis snake and gets (deservedly) brutally murdered for being a dumb action movie idiot.If you bothered to read all that and you're wondering what it had to do with the plot about finding the creator aliens, the answer is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!!  It's 60% of the movie and it is total, pointless filler.Why would David feed the Goo to what's-his-name?  Did Guy Pearce ask him to, just to see what would happen?  Did he become an evil Android for a minute, just for the hell of it?  It couldn't have possibly been planned out beforehand because they didn't even know that the BG existed until David stole a bunch of it.  The whole sub-plot implies, with half conversations and significant glances, that David or Guy Pearce or possibly Charlize ""Daddy Issues"" Theron is carrying out some intricate plan... that benefits literally no one and gets a bunch of people killed.It's a total red-herring (along with several others I don't have the energy to relive right now) that desperately tries to confuse the audience into thinking the movie is super-duper smart.Also, how about this - near the end of the movie it's established that this is NOT the Alien's home planet, but a planet they use to make awful, awful weapons.  This is confirmed at the end when David tells Hot-pants that he can lead her to the actual home planet so she can get her answers... or, you know, die horribly, which is far more likely.  So WHY would the aliens leave, on Earth, little maps to the planet they make weapons on.  Of all the planets they (apparently) hang out at, why a map to THAT one?I could keep going, but there's no need to beat that poor horse anymore.Aside from the insultingly stupid script, the visuals (while well done) are just a series if images borrowed from other sources.  Alien, Star Trek, the Abyss... a slew of sci-fi designs were yoinked to make the ship, the space-suits, the planet itself - almost nothing felt truly original to me.  But, I don't know, maybe that's me reading too much into it and being hypercritical.  I'm not exactly on the movie's side at this point.I suppose the greatest falling apart is that the film never knows what it wants to be.  It wants to be a prequel to Alien, but doesn't want to be an Alien movie.  Sometimes it's a horror movie, with creepy monsters and jump scares.  Sometimes it wants to be an action movie, with obligatory action scenes and flamethrowers and expendable guys with guns.  Sometimes it wants to be a psychological thriller about God, Religion and hating your parents.  Sometimes it's a stupid monster movie.And never once is it Science Fiction.  Don't even bother.  Just because something is in space doesn't make it science fiction.I don't argue that Ridley Scott is a very talented film maker, and I don't argue the movie is a lot better than a wide array of things out right now.  But if you're like me, and you like a decent story, this mess is absolutely infuriating.Vagina squids and all.",2,Fancy Filler,1342396800,"07 16, 2012",2012,7295,"['Prometheus', 'might', 'be', 'most',

1475504,A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ,B005LAIHXQ,"Grimmy ""Grimmy""","[32, 48]","In this movie, Scott explores again the theme of creator versus creation. However, it is maddeningly incomplete - sometimes purposefully, I hope. (POSSIBLE SPOILERS)A pale-skinned ""god"" sacrifices himself to seed a planet - ours? - with his DNA. Why is his dramatic death necessary? How about a blood extraction? It appears to be ritualistic and gratuitous. Perhaps it speaks to the theme of God's self-sacrifice in Christianity, and is meant to be a basis (racial memory, etc.) for such elements in religion.So, the team takes off in a Weyland ship to meet their makers. On the journey, we are entertained by watching David, the android, who passes time shooting hoops, watching movies, and eavesdropping on his co-passengers' dreams. Rapace's Shaw remembers her father, who passes on to her his reasons for belief - ""choosing to believe"" - which Shaw echoes.On the one hand, this sounds maddeningly unscientific, which is Scott's intent. However, as recent philosophers and historians of science have come to agree, Shaw's answer is actually the only basis for believing science can tell us anything - faith in a rational God who is consistent (due to his promises) is the underlying foundation of modern knowledge. As Nancey Pearcey summarizes for us inThe Soul of Science: Christian Faith and Natural Philosophy (Turning Point Christian Worldview Series)Rejection of this foundation has left the sciences (and even math) in deep confusion, although we see the external shell continuing to operate.Also, in our real world, many scientists or agnostics have embraced ""faith"" due to what they have discovered in science (e.g. Allen Sandage). But that's another story. I doubt that Scott, whose ""1492"" was filled with historical gaffes (no one during Columbus's time thought the world was flat), was even aware of these points.Things start to not make sense. Finding that the air is breathable, they remove their helmets. That's right. Who needs to worry about infectious agents in an alien world? Then two scientists, including the one who mapped the alien structure/ship they find, get lost. Later, one of them tries to pet a hitherto unknown alien life form, with bad results.Some of the crew are dismissive of David, almost rude and contemptuous. This behavior is hard to believe, unless we accept this as objective, scientific callousness (they know David has no feelings - or does he?), but is needed for a creepy plot point where, in conversation with David, one of them essentially approves his own demise. It's a very effective and squirmworthy scene.In another scene, the captain opens the door to an unexpected visitor. Right. Chaos ensues. In a way, it's all rather silly, if you think about it.There are questions. Is Vickers an android as well? Or is she Weyland's daughter? Weyland says David is the closest he'll have to a son, and Vickers looks pained. Some think this means she's really human (along with the fact that she has sex with humans). Yet later she slams super-strong David against a wall to get him to divulge something. Is this super-strength or is David merely humoring her? (The fact that she calls Weyland ""Father"" means nothing. Androids tend to become unpredictable in the movies, and David is no exception, either.)Also, why do the Engineers want to destroy us? Are we a threat? There is a phrase in the movie to the effect that ""sometimes to create you first have to destroy."" Likewise, Vickers is waiting for Weyland to die so she can take over (""A king dies ..."") and David seems to want his creators dead (""Doesn't everyone ...?"") Do the Engineers want to start over? Or is it just a necessary step in their whole scheme of things? Is something else going to take over from us?Or ... are we their creators? Wow.Why does the awakened Engineer go beserk? What did David say to him? A great scene underscoring the importance of android-thought-process monitoring, but somewhat abrupt.And why are there still other ships and Engineers on the planet, after 2,000 years? Are they on Union rules? (Note: this seems to be a different planet than the one in Aliens.)So many questions, hopefully to be answered in a sequel, where Scott can really jump the shark. A real fear, if you know what his ""twist"" in Blade Runner (regarding Tyrell) was supposed to be, thankfully averted.Note, though, the movie's tie-ins to ""In the Mountains of Madness"". I don't know how much Scott sticks to that plot, but it may explain most everything.The CGI is mostly great, except for the Engineer's death at the start (looks a little cartoonish). But otherwise the visuals are sci-fi wonderful. The monolithic spaceship hovering over the barren planet. The Prometheus, the Porsche to the Nostromo's Tonka. The Engineers. The Engineer seated in his slithering seat. The falling of the alien ship. (Too bad the cause was telegraphed in the trailers - I would have liked that to be a surprise.) The color palettes and production design demand to be seen over and over again. And I can't wait to see this on a 3D TV.The score evokes a theme or two from Blade Runner, appropriately.Ultimately, it's a little confused or confusing. The people don't behave logically, and some plot points don't make sense. But any fan of Blade Runner and sci fi will enjoy it nevertheless. Fassbender's David is spellbinding, and is reason alone to enjoy this movie.",3,"Sometimes senseless, but sensually splendid",1339977600,"06 18, 2012",2012,5356,"['movie', 'Scott', 'again', 'theme',

Is this a Tool video? It sure looks like a Tool video. I didn't even know Tool were still making videos anymore...No this is actually the film, definitely the start of the movie. Definitely not a Tool video........................................this is meant to be someone's dream huh? Looks very structured for a dream to me but then my dreams are always pretty 'out there', especially that one where I was a seahorse and I was taking off my trainers all the time sucking tea through the laces and then..................................I don't think the robot would have watched my dream...I think he would have turned it off. For a robot he sure likes his hair. It's nice hair don't get me................................I can't remember Alien moving this fast, that first film was all about the suspense, the creeping dread...are we in a rush? Just how much are they trying to squeeze into this film? S-l-o-w d-o-w-n. Weren't we in Scotland two minutes ago? How big is this crew? Oh look, is that Charlize Theron? She can be a bit up and down, was impressed with her in Monster but generally not too...................................ok, so weren't these two stranded scientists absolutely terrified of their own shadows two minutes ago, now they are embracing their inner Steve Irwins and trying to tickle alien life forms...................................oooooh icky...think we saw that one coming...................................I still don't feel I know much about any of the crew at all...oh, there's Charlize Theron again. She's a little wooden in this. Ah ok, they just made a joke about that in the film so that's...heh heh...that's kinda funny. Still wouldn't mind seeing her get killed off though, is that wrong? I think that might be wrong. Does that make me a bad person? I don't know..................................is it me or have I watched people put on and take off space helmets a hell of a lot in this film..................................so that's the future of medical science, a very big staple gun...and wasn't that one of those grabbers you get in the amusement arcade? You can't pull an alien out of someone with one of those, nine times out of ten you'll end up getting the Angry Birds plushy...............................those helmets are still on and off, on and off...not the most dramatic of devices all told.................................ok, that wasn't a huge surprise. It was a ship. In the shape of...a dog turd?!!! Now that IS a bit of a surprise, some definite creativity there................................time to wake up sleeping beauty then...time to find out the meaning of life, our origins...this is it...oh, he just wants to fight..................................flying dog turd!!!..................................you can't outrun this giant turd Charlize...Oh! Oh that is beautiful...poetic even! She is crushed by the giant whoopsy! Oh, this film is almost redeeming itself here.................................this film is taking an age wrapping up, sheesh. What is that? Oh, an alien! Like the ones we know and love! I'd almost forgotten about them...................................well that was disappointing................END TRANSMISSIONUnfortunately 'Prometheus' will go down as the cinematic disappointment of the year - there's little new here, the film brings up a few interesting ideas but doesn't know where to run with them, the plot is threadbare, there is a painful lack of suspense and horror (even the music is pretty poor and fails to help to build tension), the characterisation is for the most part non existent, many of the performances are unengaging, the dialogue functional at best. All the best ideas were done before and better - the 'pregnancy' scene was nowhere near as dramatic as the one in Alien, we've seen the robot before and played more effectively by both Ian Holm and Lance Henriksen (Fassbender doesn't have the machine like coldness and appears too outwardly evil right from the start), Noomi Rapace is no Sigourney Weaver and isn't charismatic enough to lead this film, the alien life forms aren't as interesting as in the previous films (compare the brilliant designs of the egg pods, facehuggers and aliens themselves to the random collections of tentacles and dark eyed baldies in this film, no comparison - the psychosexual imagery which is perhaps the main theme of Alien is more often than not comedic here rather than unsettling).The saddest thing of all is that there IS a good idea for an Alien film here - it just never satisfactorily materialises in this guise.[see Comments link for further thoughts on 'Prometheus' after a second viewing]",2,"Life,

YEO ""gyeo""","[2, 5]","To his credit somewhat, Ridley Scott, visual maverick and visionary director - had moved on from Alien when he approached this project and clearly didn't want to replicate the genre he had created and others had built on.  Instead, Scott delivers an old-fashioned existentialistic sci-fi film with a plot that feels more early 1970s than the post-modern look it offers.The challenge appears to be: one can't go back anymore to Alien - but you still need to rope in the faithful, so what do you do?  You revive some familiar elements, dash it with a cryptic 2001: A Space Odyssey opening; get Michael Fassebender to channel David Bowie (from The Man Who Fell to Earth); go where no man has gone before ala Star Trek, and try to infuse the meaning of life into this space opera.  Casting wise, Noomi Rapace is capable, but she's no Sigourney Weaver. Charlize Theron's character is far more intriguing & edgier and should have been given more to do.  While Michael Fassbender pretty much carries the show.Visually, Prometheus is a nice film and the cast do a good job - but overall the film is too bright (you feel like you're standing in a florescent room); the pacing is too slow to be scary and it telegraphs its moves.  Understandably, Ridley Scott is an elder statesman of film.  He's still got the visual chops and art direction, but in creating a deliberate Kingdom of Heaven style of film in space, it all becomes a bit pedestrian.  At times we are intrigued; at other times, we feel we've seen it before and it's coming at us as it always has - but somewhat slowly.So that's what Prometheus leaves me: a mixed bag experience with moments of wonder and moments of B-movie.  The Alien franchise has not been particularly upped or enhanced by this, and Ridley's original film will remains the true classic that defined a genre.  Where the original was gripping and engaging - Prometheus will come across somewhat cold and removed in its emotional core.",3,An Average Not Quite Alienish Experience,1367712000,"05 5, 2013",2013,1955,"['credit', 'somewhat', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'visual', 'maverick', 'visionary', 'director', 'had', 'moved', 'Alien', 'when', 'approached', 'project', 'clearly', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'replicate', 'genre', 'had', 'created', 'others', 'had', 'built', 'Instead', 'Scott', 'old-fashioned', 'existentialistic', 'sci-fi', 'film', 'plot', 'more', 'early', '1970s', 'post-modern', 'look', 'challenge', 'be', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'back', 'anymore', 'Alien', 'still', 'need', 'rope', 'faithful', 'what', 'do', 'do', 'revive', 'familiar', 'elements', 'cryptic', '2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', 'opening', 'get', 'Michael', 'Fassebender', 'channel', 'David', 'Bowie', 'Man', 'Who', 'Fell', 'Earth', 'go', 'where', 'man', 'gone', 'before', 'ala', 'Star', 'Trek', 'try', 'infuse', 'meaning', 'life', 'space', 'opera', 'Casting', 'wise', 'Noomi', 'Rapace', 'capable', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'character', 'far', 'more', 'intriguing', 'edgier', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'more', 'do', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'pretty', 'much', 'show.Visually', 'Prometheus', 'nice', 'film', 'cast', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'film', 'too', 'bright', 'feel', ""'re"", 'standing', 'florescent', 'room', 'pacing', 'too', 'slow', 'be', 'scary', 'telegraphs', 'moves', 'Understandably', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'elder', 'statesman', 'film', 'still', 'got', 'visual', 'chops', 'art', 'direction', 'creating', 'deliberate', 'Kingdom', 'Heaven', 'style', 'film', 'space', 'bit', 'pedestrian', 'times', 'are', 'intrigued', 'other', 'times', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'coming', 'always', 'somewhat', 'slowly.So', 'what', 'Prometheus', 'mixed', 'bag', 'experience', 'moments', 'wonder', 'moments', 'B-movie', 'Alien', 'franchise', 'not', 'been', 'particularly', 'upped', 'enhanced', 'Ridley', 'original', 'film', 'will', 'remains', 'true', 'classic', 'defined', 'genre', 'Where', 'original', 'was', 'gripping', 'engaging', 'Prometheus', 'will', 'come', 'somewhat', 'cold', 'removed', 'emotional', 'core']",N/A

I mean it starts off amazing but the last 20 minutes felt like an episode from Buffy the Vampire slayer. Its like the producers inserted the big explosions at the end and edited out the better parts, like the scene with Guy Pierce giving a Ted talk (you can see it on Youtube, its better than the film). There were other clever scenes planned for Prometheus that didn't make it into the final cut.I don't know why it's being marketed as a prequel to the Alien movies, this has nothing to do with Alien and Aliens, it isn't a prequel, it is sh't! AlI reckon that the produces chickened out and dumbed it down for some reason...Its like they showed another version to a group of people who didn't get it and so they cut all the cool stuff out and patched it up with rubbish.I listened to Terry Gilliam once on the radio saying that Hollywood is reluctant to release a film unless it's first been viewed by a focus group. This way the film can better suit the tastes of the public, or to be more precise, the tastes of the small sample picked for the focus group, and because this tiny sample of humanity represents the rest of us, the film will be just great. So this boils down to about 40 people, picked at random from the public, like they do in jury service, choosing what goes into the final cut. It doesn't matter if the writer of the film is a genius, like Terry Gilliam, because these days, a jury of 'yahoos' choose how the film develops""! I borrowed the 'yahoo' bit from Bill Hicks who complained about the same phenomenon.This 'sample of the public' that Terry Gilliam and Bill Hicks are talking about, or to use less Orwell-spach jargon, the whims of the average person, is reflected on the final cut of the film and this is why many films we see these days always end happily, even when the plot was obviously leading to a tragic finale, or the narrative sometimes seams 'chopped' and dumbed down in places and so confuses and abuses the intelligence of the paying viewer.Welcome Prometheus, the biggest pile of horse dung the yahoos can muster!""If an ass peers into a book, do not expect a saint to peer out.""

The characters that were built up for destruction like a Cabin in the woods really had no purpose of attention in the first place. Some say this was a prequel to some other film and some say there is a sequel coming, the acting and directing was quite horrible I felt. Michael Fassbender who is usually a terrific actor was quite mediocre in this, there was no sync in his character from beginning to end even though...*insert spoiler* The director didn't seem to know whether to make a Jurassic Park out of this film, or whether to make a Planet of the Apes or whether to just make this film ""The Core"" and trying to do so many things at once proved a little unbecoming for the viewer.

1475520,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B005LAIHXQ,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[21, 35]","PROMETHEUS may be a prequel to ALIEN, but fixating too much on making those connections will probably sabotage your overall enjoyment of the film. After more than three decades Ridley Scott returns to the franchise that established a new watershed mark for sci-fi horror. That's plenty of time to stew things over for a sequel. But while PROMETHEUS does address a few questions, it frustratingly raises even more. Case in point, the mystery of the Space Jockey figure. Still, I appreciate that the narrative doesn't spoonfeed you the answers.In 2093 the deep space vessel Prometheus, spurred by a clue 35,000 years old, journeys to a distant and inhospitable moon in search of mankind's origins. Prometheus is manned by a crew of seventeen, many of them anonymous cannon fodder. On the barren moon a scouting team eyes a vast, unnatural construct and explores it. Inside they find air that is breathable... and the remains of an ancient alien civilization.Prepare to be gobsmacked by the eloquence and scope of Ridley's storytelling. The set designs are magnificently realized and, gratifyingly, still very much influenced by H.R. Giger's ominous surrealism. For those who may get their Scotts and Camerons confused, PROMETHEUS is more reminiscent of ALIEN in its slow burn evocation of atmosphere and tone. The tone itself is contemplative. There's an exploration into the metaphysical stuff, into the relationship between science and religion. The story takes its time but builds to a blistering crescendo. The spooky bits are parceled out in measured doses; Scott once more prefers to let your imagination do the work. Honestly, the film is heavy on mood but light on terror. It does eventually unleash several nice scares, and ****REST-OF-SENTENCE SPOILER NOW**** particularly one harrowing moment involving a cringe-inducing bout of self-surgery.Next to THE AVENGERS and THE DARK KNIGHT RISES, PROMETHEUS is this summer's most anticipated film. Which leaves it vulnerable for a letdown, expectations being so high. Those going in the theater salivating for a comprehensive backstory will probably exit grumbling. There is a connective tissue, but Ridley Scott doesn't confine himself to the ALIEN mythos and with crossing t's and dotting i's. He expands on it, paints a bigger canvas. He introduces even more concepts. He lays in the puzzle of the Space Jockeys, who we learn are genetic engineers who may have created humanity. We're left questioning their motivations with regards to the human race.The film gives us expert direction, staggering visual effects, marvelous acting. Noomi Rapace's archaeologist Elizabeth Shaw emerges as our point-of-view character. She starts out as this sort of sweet, unprepossesing scientist willing to be coddled by her more adventurous scientist partner. In time, when it all turns to sh--, we see her channel the strength and awesome kickassery of Sigourney Weaver (although Rapace doesn't quite match Weaver's thunder). A deliciously creepy Michael Fassbender plays David, the android whose motivations seem mercurial and ever suspect. The excellent Idris Elba, as the laid back ship's captain, provides a dash of levity and a much needed human touch. And stepping in the shady Paul Reiser ""company man"" role, Charlize Theron is so icy and impassive that debate immediately surfaces regarding her true nature. Is she or isn't she? What she is, is underused.I rate PROMETHEUS 3.5 out of 5 stars. The stuff I liked, I liked very much. But the flaws... aaaiiyeeee! Or is that perceived flaws? I'm a bit torn about something. I refer to Ridley Scott's measure of ambiguity and his reluctance to produce those big reveals, to provide an even more pronounced connective tissue to ALIEN. One thought is that he's holding out for a sequel, in which case I'm on board. There's something to be said for slow burn gratification. But other elements undermine the film. Bits of metaphysical exposition come off as heavyhanded. I hate that a sizable chunk of the narrative stems from the scientists' making so many poor choices. Personnel eschew proper protocol. They throw caution to the winds and discard their oxygen helmets. They abandon their observation posts for a quickie while other crewmen are stranded off the ship. They think menacing tentacles emerging from inky pools are cute and harmless. I won't even go into Guy Pearce's unconvincing old man make-up. These nitpicks wouldn't be as readily apparent were this film not a furtherance of the classic ALIEN mythology. You can probably brush them off on BATTLESHIP or the TRANSFORMERS sequels. But there's a level of intelligence attached to this franchise that is compromised here. So, to sum it up, PROMETHEUS is a dazzling, powerful visual feast and thought-provoking enough, and it does give you moments in which you make those instant connections. Its grand scope absolutely begs for a viewing in the movie theater (you can probably give the 3-D a pass). I wouldn't mind seeing the survivor(s) in a follow-up picture.

This movie just leaves the audience confused. I admired the direction that the movie was striving for (where do we come from, who made us, etc.), but this garbage only answers those questions with more questions.

1475526,A2L5IDS334C1GL,B005LAIHXQ,Hexanova,"[5, 12]","These are impressions I typed up after seeing it last weekend.- Overall Rating:  8.5/105 of us went, and we went to a restaurant after and talked about it for an hour.  After we did I asked for ratings out of 4.Me - 3.5/4 (I upped my review above to 8.5/10 which is close to 3.5/4.Wife - 3.5/4Brother - Initially said 4/4, then backed off to 3.5/4Male friend - 3.5/4Female friend - 3.5/4.  This one blew me away, because I thought she would HATE this movie.  It's not up her alley AT ALL.  She said she liked it because it was tense and adult, not like Avatar.  Those were her words.  I asked her about the xenosnake going down the guys throat (she was squirming like crazy during that part) and she said she loved it.  Go figure.- Awesome FX, great 3D, amazing design, amazing filming/cinematography.  No debate there.- The main story is pretty simplistic, it parallels Alien (and unfortunately AVP).  The difference is the whole spiritual subplot...and I think that needed some more work.- Needed more engineer action IMO.  They were under utilized.  The surviving engineer is barely in the movie.  The engineers were in the first and last shot of the movie but kind of ignored as the central antagonist of the movie.  Really disappointed in this aspect of the movie.The xeno scene at the end was both necessary and completely unnecessary at the same time.  I really wouldn't have cared one bit if they'd never tied this to Alien at all.  I was perfectly willing to keep this completely separate.- I still maintain that the central story is about Weyland even though he's barely in it.  Everything David does is because of Weyland.  David has no agenda or motivation beyond that.  Everything Vickers does is to defy her father.- The motives of Holloway and Shaw are secondary (yet more interesting, and left mostly unexplored and fleshed out).  I'm hoping the sequel will explore this side of it more since Shaw seemed damned determined to find out.  I wished they had focused on either Weyland's quest for immortality OR Shaw's quest for the mysteries of life/creation.  Mixing them together led to both being muted.- I found the acting to be pretty solid (Fassbender stands out as everyone has said).  There are bad lines, but that's not the fault of the acting.- I find movies that create questions to be just as satisfying as those that spoon feed us the answers.  The Fountain is like this.  A million questions but I still liked it.  Prometheus is in the vein.- Fox marketing really screwed the pooch on the trailers.  They DID show way too much.  The viral aspects have been brilliant though.- I think this movie was cut in the hope of a PG-13 rating, and they barely missed it.

LUI,"[17, 28]","Other than the seemingly forced appearance by one of cinema's most famous monsters at the end, Prometheus is very much a film that stands on its own apart from the Alien universe . Sir Ridley Scott and co. I think were very wise in going toward a different direction for the franchise and to focus on the ""Engineers"" . As a result those like myself who is a big fan of the Alien movies are introduced to a much richer universe.I am intrigued by the character of Dr. Shaw because she not only is a person of science but a person of faith as well and this dichotomy I think is the basis of her journey, which is the search for truth to humanity's origins. To me I think the true horror in this movie are not the horrible creatures that wreck havoc on the crew of the Prometheus but the revelation that the gods or God have forsaken their creations and even worse intend to destroy what they made(What if you found out that you were a mistake?). Dr. Shaw's discovery does not make her want to run back to Earth but instead drives her to find the source of the ""Engineers"" thus her journey continues for answers  and sets us up for a sequel which I certainly hope happens.This is another winner from Ridley Scott. The cinematography is awe-inspiring. The art direction is superb. The effects enhance. The music by Marc Streitenfeld is channeling Vangelis (composer of Scott's Bladerunner and 1492).The most thrilling scene of the movie is Dr. Shaw's self surgery to remove an unwanted embryo from her body. Definitely a keeper.Michael Fassbender treats us to another great performance as the artificial man DAVID 8 who himself was engineered by humanity which introduces us to another potential dichotomy that can be explored in the sequel. He is definitely more interesting than most of the human crew. You can call him a HAL 9000 with legs.As a film Prometheus truly stands apart from the rest of the Alien films. In fact the presence of the ""Alien"" or xenomorph in the film is almost questionable. If you remove that then the only thing that ties this movie to Alien are the ""Engineers"". So what we have here is really a spinoff which makes it all the more interesting for fans of the Alien universe. Highly recommended.",5,A spinoff and not a prequel.

The sets & computer generated scenics/effects are pretty well unmatched in our time. That being said, it seems as if all that cool & beautiful stuff distracted the film makers from everything else. They ignored the fact that the characters were becoming more senseless & unlikeable as the film progressed. as was the script.

For a movie to look so beautiful & have such annoying characters doing idiotic things throughout, is unforgivable...I watched the short documentary ""Direct Effect"" to try to gain some understanding of Ridley Scott's creative vision. Unfortunately, I found him to be just as ambiguous & contradictory as the plot of Prometheus.

1475541,A2ICW5OUWX2A2V,B005LAIHXQ,Ian,"[5, 13]","Prequels to extremely popular films rarely turn out well.  By and large, they're not great, and only occasionally good.  Even rarer is a prequel that is just as good as the originals...but ""Prometheus"" is not one of them.  It gets so tantalizingly close to reaching that coveted rank, but just misses it.In the near future, a group of scientists travel to a distant planet for the scientific expedition of a lifetime: the chance to learn exactly where humans came from, and the chance to meet with our creators.  But upon arriving, they quickly learn that they may have discovered something that will lead to humanity's end.In many ways, ""Prometheus"" is an excellent film: its basic concept (what if humans were created by aliens and we could go and meet them?) is fantastic; the atmosphere and visuals are top notch, and when the film hits it's stride, it's an undeniable masterpiece, especially during the first half, where there's a constant sense of exploration and adventure, of finding new things and getting closer and closer to a coveted goal.  ""Prometheus"" functions as a prequel to 1979's, ""Alien"" and although events in this film do not lead into the original, there are numerous winks and nods towards what has come before, which are a delight for fans of the Xenomorph creature.  I especially loved learning more about the so called, ""Space Jockey"" creature that was seen in the original, and learning more about it's species, which arguably makes for the most engaging moments in the film.Sadly however, while ""Prometheus"" is more often then not, a fascinating film, it makes some huge blunders along the way.  The pacing in the second half of the second act unexpectedly ratchets up from slow paced to breakneck, with things happening so fast it's easy to loose track of what's going on, especially with regards to the characters (of which there are too many), and why they act the way they do; for a bunch of scientists, they make some really stupid decisions (look!  An alien life form!  Let's try to pick it up when it's clearly angry at us!) and do really bizarre things (one character, after going through a rather horrific act, goes back to wandering around the ship/exploring without bothering to tell anyone what happened, which bugs me to no end).  David the android, in particular, while fascinating to watch, lacks the simple, effective characterization that Ash and Bishop had; he does things seemingly out of random, and even two days after seeing the film, I'm still trying to figure out his motivations.The editing also adds to the frustration, as I got the sense that a lot was cut out of the finished film, as the rushed pace feels like a lot was cut out to save on the running time.  But worst of all is the feeling of not getting any closure. ""Prometheus"" raises questions it has no intention of answering, and with the ending hinting towards a sequel, the movie feels frustratingly incomplete, rather then a stand-alone film.While ""Prometheus"" comes so tantalizingly close to being a perfect film, it's incomplete feeling, breakneck speed, and choppy editing pull it down (though the third act does manage to recover, and ends with a rather spectacular finale).  It's a great movie, and when it worked, I was more absorbed in it then any other film in recent memory, but I was left with the maddening feeling that it could have crossed the threshold into classic territory if it had been a little more focused and tightened up.  Still, for what it is, it's a great ride for anyone who's ever wondered if we owe our existence to beings beyond the stars.",3,"So very, very, very close",1339286400,"06 10, 2012",2012,3587,"['Prequels', 'extremely', 'popular', 'films', 'rarely', 'turn', 'out', 'well', 'large', ""'re"", 'not', 'great', 'only', 'occasionally', 'good', 'Even', 'rarer', 'prequel', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'originals', 'Prometheus', 'not', 'one', 'so', 'tantalizingly', 'close', 'reaching', 'coveted', 'rank', 'just', 'misses', 'it.In', 'near', 'future', 'group', 'scientists', 'travel', 'distant', 'planet', 'scientific', 'expedition', 'lifetime', 'chance', 'learn', 'exactly', 'where', 'humans', 'came', 'chance', 'meet', 'creators', 'arriving', 'quickly', 'learn', 'may', 'have', 'discovered', 'something', 'will', 'lead', 'humanity', 'end.In', 'many', 'ways', 'Prometheus', 'excellent', 'film', 'basic', 'concept', 'what', 'humans', 'were', 'created', 'aliens', 'could', 'go', 'meet', 'fantastic', 'atmosphere', 'visuals', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'when', 'film', 'stride', 'undeniable', 'masterpiece', 'especially', 'first', 'half', 'where', 'constant', 'sense', 'exploration', 'adventure', 'finding', 'new', 'things', 'getting', 'closer', 'closer', 'coveted', 'goal', 'Prometheus', 'functions', 'prequel', '1979', 'Alien', 'events', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'lead', 'original', 'are', 'numerous', 'winks', 'nods', 'towards', 'what', 'come', 'are', 'delight', 'fans', 'Xenomorph', 'creature', 'especially', 'loved', 'learning', 'more', 'so', 'called', 'Space', 'Jockey', 'creature', 'was', 'seen', 'original', 'learning', 'more', 'species', 'arguably', 'most', 'engaging', 'moments', 'film.Sadly', 'however', 'Prometheus', 'more', 'often', 'then', 'not', 'fascinating', 'film', 'huge', 'blunders', 'way', 'pacing', 'second', 'half', 'second', 'act', 'unexpectedly', 'up', 'slow', 'paced', 'breakneck', 'things', 'happening', 'so', 'fast', 'easy', 'loose', 'track', 'what', 'going', 'especially', 'regards', 'characters', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'why', 'act', 'way', 'do', 'bunch', 'scientists', 'make', 'really', 'stupid', 'decisions', 'look', 'alien', 'life', 'form', 'Let', 'try', 'pick', 'up', 'when', 'clearly', 'angry', 'do', 'really', 'bizarre', 'things', 'one', 'character', 'going', 'rather', 'horrific', 'act', 'back', 'wandering', 'ship/exploring', 'bothering', 'tell', 'anyone', 'happened', 'end', 'David', 'android', 'particular', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'simple', 'effective', 'characterization', 'Ash', 'Bishop', 'had', 'things', 'seemingly', 'random', 'even', 'two', 'days', 'seeing', 'film', ""'m"", 'still', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'motivations.The', 'editing', 'also', 'frustration', 'got', 'sense', 'lot', 'was', 'cut', 'finished', 'film', 'rushed', 'pace', 'feels', 'lot', 'was', 'cut', 'out', 'save', 'running', 'time', 'worst', 'feeling', 'not', 'getting', 'closure', 'Prometheus', 'questions', 'intention', 'answering', 'ending', 'hinting', 'towards', 'sequel', 'movie', 'frustratingly', 'incomplete', 'rather', 'then', 'stand-alone', 'film.While', 'Prometheus', 'so', 'tantalizingly', 'close', 'being', 'perfect', 'film', 'incomplete', 'feeling', 'breakneck', 'speed', 'choppy', 'editing', 'pull', 'down', 'third', 'act', 'manage', 'recover', 'rather', 'spectacular', 'finale', 'great', 'movie', 'when', 'worked', 'was', 'more', 'absorbed', 'then', 'other', 'film', 'recent', 'memory', 'was', 'left', 'maddening', 'feeling', 'could', 'have', 'crossed', 'threshold', 'classic', 'territory', 'had', 'been', 'little', 'more', 'focused', 'tightened', 'up', 'Still', 'what', 'great', 'ride', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'wondered', 'owe', 'existence', 'beings', 'stars']",N/A

I have read countless reviews on IMDB that crucify this movie for being inaccurate and lacking in scientific reason. I found this movie to be a hypnotizing cinematic experience. The CGI sucked me right into the movie, and I was only watching the 2d version.I will admit that I have never watched any of the Alien films that came before Prometheus. I do not see this as a bad thing. Prometheus stands on its own just perfectly, especially since it is a prequel after all. I will also admit it took awhile for me to get sucked into the world that this film creates. The story gets set up superbly around the mid point of the film and the CGI starts to really shine.With an abundance of bonus features, this 4 disc blu ray package is a steal at $19.99.

1475547,A1Y0HX12MCT6OR,B005LAIHXQ,I'm Right,"[42, 69]","Prometheus came out with high, high expectations, so it's no biggie that it didn't live up to that hype. No, there were many different problems, but the biggest one I had with it was that it awkwardly shifted between horror and sci-fi, and doing neither effectively.Actually the horror aspect wasn't so bad, I got truly scared when I first saw one of the scientists had a pink mowhawk and tattoos. I was really scared for how the movie would turn out. So a crew is sent on a trillion dollar mission to search for life on a distant planet, judging by the sheer enormity of the mission you'd think they'd send only the best and brightest right? Well no, not at all. Almost every crew member makes completely baffling stupid decisions throughout the movie, and the ones that don't make stupid decisions are completely underutilized.Once they arrive on the planet, they drive down one little valley to the 'tomb' or whatever is located, so that's all you see of the planet, that little valley and the one tomb, ok whatever. So they get into the 'tomb' and one of them decides to pull off his helmet because the air is breatheable. Ok? So what if it's breatheable, what about alien viruses, toxins, bacteria, aren't you guys supposed to be really smar-oh great now they're all removing their helmets. So Ridley Scott made this movie to appeal to mouth-breathing neanderthals, ok whatever maybe it'll be a good horror movie.So the Punk Scientist (I can't believe what I'm typing) and his ambigiously gay friend go split off from everyone in true bad horror movie writing, and can't find their way out for plot convience. Eventually they get trapped inside the tomb because of a storm and the ship is monitering them. Well only one guys is monitering these two idiots stranded on a planet and all he says to them is 'sleep tight' then laughs at his gay joke. Don't worry it gets dumber. Charlize Thereon, who's made out to be this cold calculating badass captain decides to sleep with the only guy watching the two stranded crew guys, and I think it was at this point where I started chucking candy at the screen. This was directed by the same guy that did Alien, Black Hawk Down, and Gladiator?So the two scientists are scared s***less about the crew finding other signs of life in the tomb, but when some snake-like creature comes out of the water they're next to, what do they do? Well the choice is obvious, stick your arm out and try to pet it. Then goofus and gallant get picked off in admittably creepy ways while the whole crew on Prometheus is busy f***ing each other. Later in another scene the captain realizes that one of the crewmembers is contaminated and can't come back on the ship, however later when one of the idiots who's been missing for like a day comes back the crew just opens up the hatch without checking him out first, not realizing that the guy is now some angry giant mutant straight outta the Hills Have Eyes.So it seems like this is going to go for to pure adrenline-rushing horror, but instead Prometheus takes a left turn and brings Guy Pearce in a cheap old man costume out for no reason other than to throw in a tweest, and none of the crew members seem to care, I sure as hell didn't. The rest of the movie turns into some stupid social commentary, such as ""they ain't stupid 'nuff to build weapons of mass destruction on their front doorstep"" or ""what did we do to deserve to die""? Great, now this movie thinks it's smart.So Prometheus could've been a solid albeit dumb horror movie, but instead it tries to expand upon it's vague half-baked typical self-loathing hollywood message that humans don't deserve to live. Then Ridley Scott shoves his 'working class good, corporations bad' message AGAIN. We see the white collar members are up to no good, scheming behind everyone's back while the cool down to earth blue collar guys are the good guys. The crew don't even get picked off in a tense cool way of getting hunted or anything, they ram their ship into another ship, dying in the lamest way possible. See kids, Prometheus is too smart to be fun.So later the crew with Old Guy pearce meet up with the engineer who was sleeping and when they wake him up, does he want to communicate with the beings that he supposedly created? Does he want to assess the situation to know there's a giant ship outside ready to ram his if he tries to escape? Nope, he goes on a gorilla rampage beating everyone then jumps into his ship. Then after the multi-cultural blue collar folks ram into his ship the two leading ladies are being chased by the donut-shaped ship rolling along, only one of them realizing that you should move out of the direction that it's rolling in.Prometheus is a flat out disappointment. Nice set designs and atmosphere don't erase poor script-writing and a geniuenly lame story, Prometheus is made for idiots who want to pretend that they're smart.",2,Poopetheus,1339372800,"06 11,

1475548,A3CALY5BP8OQ9C,B005LAIHXQ,Infinite Loop,"[2, 4]","Ridley Scott is tapped out, time to retire. I actually felt sorry for the actors; imagine how excited they were to get on board a film directed by The Famous Ridely Scott!  This film is evidence of how even good actors can't save a disastrous plot and helpless script.  It's too bad Mr. Scott didn't consult with me prior to making this epic dog pile.  This would've been my advice:1) DO NOT do another Alien movie!  That signature franchise is tapped out. Do something completely different. Surprise your audience, come up with some fresh ideas or new approaches to old themes.2) You HAD the basis for something interesting during the film's five minute opening. It was beautiful, stunning and mind-blowing imagery up until the moment when the dude drank the black goop then disintegrated in the water.3) Make spaceship interiors look like REAL spaceships!  Aliens #1 & #2 were much more believable, as were the sets for Battlestar Galactica or Firefly.  Try visiting the next closest thing we have to a spaceship with a large crew -- an aircraft carrier or, better yet, a submarine. Maybe watch Das Boot a couple of times, maybe you'll get an idea of what it's like to have 100 people living in a 300-ft long, 30-ft wide iron tube for months at a time.4) Never waste a character!  ALL characters are important, even if they're going to be killed off half-way through the film; they all have stories, give them real relationships with other crew members.  I'm reminded of the famous squad of Colonial Marines from Aliens #2 -- their performance as a unit made the whole movie work, they made it believable.

Alien was a dark, cold, spartan film set in a bleak, merciless universe. The budget and effects limitations at the time meant that Scott had to use his imagination to create dread. Here he has all the money and effects he can ask for and the resulting film is the polar opposite. Less is more. A filmmaker like Scott should know that. All 4 Alien movies were filmed on a soundstage (save for one 'beach' shot in Alien 3). They were confined and claustrophobic. Prometheus is set in massive, wide-open spaces, which I assume is supposed to make us feel desolate and isolated. But when it cuts back and forth between interior and exterior so much the opposites negate each other, meaning we feel neither confined nor abandoned.The story is set a number of years before Alien in which a bunch of expendable characters (including a lot of nobodies) travel to a distant planet (a 4-year round trip) to find the beings that created life on Earth. When they get there they discover...a load of confusing, muddled nonsense that is far from frightening and is only just barely above mildly interesting.Alien was populated with 7 single or double-syllabled characters that felt real and authentic thanks to their quiet interactions and dialogue. We learned their names and positions quickly. Prometheus has more characters than I can count (some appear out of nowhere and quickly disappear as fast) with some of them not even being coherently named. Not that coherence is this film's strong point.Noomi Rapace is cute as Elizabeth Shaw, the lead scientist who believes in 'The Creators' (the Space Jockey creatures), but she's very miscast. Michael Fassbender as android David is the only other character who gets a notable amount of screen time. You'll care about none of them.Scott once said that the film wasn't a prequel to Alien (after originally announcing that it was) then changed his mind a short while later. If this was supposed to keep us intrigued it didn't work. If anything it only got the confusion going before anyone even saw the movie.It has some lofty ambitions, and succeeds at neither of them. The opening scene of a Creator sacrificing himself at an indefinite point in history to create mankind by putting his DNA into our water is nonsense. Was disintegrating himself the only way of doing this? Could he not have just bled into the primordial soup? Did he create the dinosaurs too? Was it a scene set just after the last ice age? Did they accidentally create primates in the process? Why did they create us in the first place? How did the early civilizations learn of the Creators? Did they visit? Why did they have a star map that led to a planet that was just a testing field?The creation of the famous Xenomorph Alien is so convoluted and preposterous. Let's see if you can follow this:Android David finds a vase of goo in the pyramid/mountain place. He touches it to his finger. He deliberately puts his finger into Holloway's champagne, infecting him as he ingests. Holloway gets sick. Before the symptoms become obvious he mates with his infertile lover Elizabeth. She becomes pregnant and quickly goes into labor. She aborts her 'hell baby' by caesarian section but just leaves it there in the operation room. Some time later the angry Creator is attacked by the full grown hell baby and is consumed by it, to a degree, for unknown reasons. That dead Creator then births a primitive Xenomorph.Pardon me, but that is a load of garbage. I honestly cannot believe something that ludicrous made its way into, what is essentially, an Alien movie. The original had so much purity and mythos. Did Ridley Scott not even watch his own movie for pointers? Lindelof and Spaihts have really painted themselves into a corner with that dumb ending too. When Shaw gets to the real Creator planet she will be the only human being in the film, if that is the way the speculative sequel will go.The mystery of the Space Jockey has been completely ruined. It could have been so much better. But Scott needs to be brought back down to Earth (pun intended) and he should have chosen his writing team more wisely. Still, it was nice to hear Jerry Goldsmith's Alien theme, albeit briefly.",2,Written by Mary Shelley,1338768000,"06 4, 2012",2012,4982,"['Spoilers', 'thar', 'be', 'Maytees.Is', 'man', 'created',

who already hate the so called ""black bars"" on top and bottom of the screen while watching a regular movie, the Aspect Ratio of 2.40:1 on 3D Home viewing brings back those horrible ""Black Bars"" and with that TAKING AWAY FROM WHAT MAKES 3D WORTH THE PURCHASE TO BEGIN WITH, minimizing the effect by a big percentage.Usually I don't mind those ""black bars"" on 2D viewing, maybe because we are all used to it by now, plus it doesn't take anything away...BUT ON 3D viewing this is the complete opposite.SO WHAT'S THE ""APPROPRIATE"" ASPECT RATIO THAT SHOULD BE IN 3D HOME MOVIES?Most 3D movies right now are NOT being released with the desirable Aspect Ratio that will fill the whole screen giving you the whole 3D effect BUT movies like Wrath Of The Titans, The Avengers, and the soon to be released AVATAR 3D, are some of the very few that could display with an average Aspect Ratio of: 1.78:1 WHICH WILL take advantage of the FULL SCREEN of your New 3D TV as you expected to display from day one.With that said, This movie unfortunately does NOT support that type of Aspect Ratio which makes it NOT worth the extra few dollars on the 3D Bluray version.Even with an enormous TV set you wouldn't want to watch a 3D movie with the black bars because...the bigger the TV, the bigger the ""black bars"" .ABOUT THE MOVIE IN GENERAL:I did like this movie when I went to see it in IMAX 3D, I

These films transcended the science fiction I was used to seeing and offered a grown-up, more cynical and dangerous version of Star Wars, Star Trek and the like. So I was one of the first in line to get tickets to Prometheus which I hoped would reboot the franchise and erase the memory of the later inferior Alien films.Overall, there are moments of supreme cinematic greatness combined with a few gaffs of bad science and plot logic but largely it's a fusion of some of Ridley Scott's most brilliant themes.*** Potential spoilers ahead ***First, the weaker parts: scientists discover a drawing of 5 dots in a cave in Scotland which they've seen in other caves throughout history - they take the massive leap of logic to presume that not only did these come from aliens as a map, but these same aliens were the creators of humans. These scientists use this flimsy thesis to convince a death-obsessed rich guy to funnel one trillion dollars into developing the technology to reach the dots.The really bad science doesn't end there. Once we reach the alien cave, they continue to make one bad decision after another despite some very scary things happening. This is where it lurches more into the teen horror flick genre where characters disband, poke around the dark and inevitably meet their Alien-oriented grisly endings.There are also some weaker moments of dialog that seem like a tack-on from test audience screenings not understanding what's happening: one has Shaw discussing her infertility with her partner in a conversational segway that's really off. Later, Charlize Theron reveals her true relationship with Weyland which is a little tired. I'm probably being a little harsh because I expect so much from this film.But on the plus side, this is an excellent movie in any regular context but also a welcome addition to the Alien universe. There is so much overlap from Alien and Aliens that there is a sense of having seen much of it all before but large parts of the idea do stand on their own. There are some truly great horror moments that are simultaneously gripping, revolting, disturbing and original, and it's these handful of scenes that stand out after watching the whole thing.The visuals have never been better, featuring an alien landscape that's seductive, fluid and organic, supported by the invisible use of first class CGI - and it looks even better in 3D. Whereas Alien pulled back from the full sexuality of H R Giger's designs, this film doesn't pull punches in the creature designs and attacks of the face-huggers. The design of the engineers, the creative use of holograms and look of the ship are all extremely well conceived.This is also an exceptional cast. Noomi Rapace reminded me of how great Sigourney Weaver was and delivers ferociously in this role. Similarly Michael Fassbender crafts a delicate performance as the ship's android, treading the line between its appreciation of the beauty of life's designs and the psychotic nature of something that can think but not feel. His character is essential in connecting the themes of death being a part of life and the desire to meet and sometimes destroy your creator.This is all wrapped in a very, very complicated backstory about how the engineers spread life around the universe like space-travelling gardeners. There are mythical connections to Prometheus (wiki it to see) and some not-too-subtle religious parallels (Shaw is a barren woman made pregnant by God?). There are strong themes of selfishness and self sacrifice, natural death and immortality, and many many references to other science fiction works.It's worthy of five stars since it's a league ahead of anything else I've seen this year and it's good to see Ridley Scott at the top of his game.",5,A worthy addition to the Alien universe,1339372800,"06 11, 2012",2012,3858,"['saw', 'two', 'original', 'Alien', 'movies', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'enough', 'would', 'forge', 'lifelong', 'love', 'movies', 'films', 'transcended', 'science', 'fiction', 'was', 'used', 'seeing', 'offered', 'grown-up', 'more', 'cynical', 'dangerous', 'version', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Star', 'Trek', 'like', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'line', 'get', 'tickets', 'Prometheus', 'hoped', 'would', 'reboot', 'franchise', 'erase', 'memory', 'later', 'inferior', 'Alien', 'films.Overall', 'are', 'moments', 'supreme', 'cinematic', 'greatness', 'combined', 'few', 'gaffs', 'bad', 'science', 'plot', 'logic', 'largely', 'fusion', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'most', 'brilliant', 'themes', '***', 'Potential', 'spoilers', 'ahead', '***First', 'weaker', 'parts', 'scientists', 'discover', 'drawing', '5', 'dots', 'cave', 'Scotland', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'caves', 'history', 'take', 'massive', 'leap', 'logic', 'presume', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'come', 'aliens', 'map', 'same', 'aliens', 'were', 'creators', 'humans', 'scientists', 'use', 'flimsy', 'thesis', 'convince', 'death-obsessed', 'rich', 'guy', 'funnel', 'one', 'trillion', 'dollars', 'developing', 'technology', 'reach', 'dots.The', 'really', 'bad', 'science', ""n't"", 'end', 'there', 'reach', 'alien', 'cave', 'continue', 'make', 'one', 'bad', 'decision', 'very', 'scary', 'things', 'happening', 'where', 'more', 'teen', 'horror', 'flick', 'genre', 'where', 'characters', 'disband', 'poke', 'dark', 'inevitably', 'meet', 'Alien-oriented', 'grisly', 'are', 'also', 'weaker', 'moments', 'dialog', 'seem', 'tack-on', 'test', 'audience', 'screenings', 'not', 'understanding', 'what', 'happening', 'one', 'Shaw', 'discussing', 'infertility', 'partner', 'conversational', 'segway', 'really', 'off', 'Later', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'true', 'relationship', 'Weyland', 'little', 'tired', ""'m"", 'probably', 'being', 'little', 'harsh', 'expect', 'so', 'much', 'film.But', 'plus', 'side', 'excellent', 'movie', 'regular', 'context', 'also', 'welcome', 'addition', 'Alien', 'universe', 'so', 'much', 'overlap', 'Alien', 'Aliens', 'sense', 'having', 'seen', 'much', 'large', 'parts', 'idea', 'do', 'stand', 'own', 'are', 'truly', 'great', 'horror', 'moments', 'are', 'simultaneously', 'gripping', 'revolting', 'disturbing', 'original', 'handful', 'scenes', 'stand', 'out', 'watching', 'whole', 'thing.The', 'visuals', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'featuring', 'alien', 'landscape', 'seductive', 'fluid', 'organic', 'supported', 'invisible', 'use', 'first', 'class', 'CGI', 'even', 'better', '3D', 'Whereas', 'Alien', 'pulled', 'back', 'full', 'sexuality', 'H', 'R', 'Giger', 'designs', 'film', ""n't"", 'pull', 'punches', 'creature', 'designs', 'attacks', 'face-huggers', 'design', 'engineers', 'creative', 'use', 'holograms', 'look', 'ship', 'are', 'extremely', 'well', 'conceived.This', 'also', 'exceptional', 'cast', 'Noomi', 'Rapace', 'reminded', 'how', 'great', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'was', 'delivers', 'ferociously', 'role', 'Similarly', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'delicate', 'performance', 'ship', 'android', 'treading', 'line', 'appreciation', 'beauty', 'life', 'designs', 'psychotic', 'nature', 'something', 'can', 'think', 'not', 'feel', 'character', 'essential', 'connecting', 'themes', 'death', 'being', 'part', 'life', 'desire', 'meet', 'sometimes', 'destroy', 'creator.This', 'wrapped', 'very', 'very', 'complicated', 'backstory', 'how', 'engineers', 'spread', 'life', 'universe', 'space-travelling', 'gardeners', 'are', 'mythical', 'connections', 'Prometheus', 'wiki', 'see', 'not-too-subtle', 'religious', 'parallels', 'Shaw', 'barren', 'woman', 'made', 'pregnant', 'God', 'are', 'strong', 'themes', 'selfishness', 'self', 'sacrifice', 'natural', 'death', 'immortality', 'many', 'many', 'references', 'other', 'science', 'fiction', 'works.It', 'worthy', 'five', 'stars', 'league', 'ahead', 'anything', 'else', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', 'good', 'see', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'top', 'game']",N/A

1475574,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B005LAIHXQ,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[4, 8]","Ridley Scott, while making many other films during his almost 40-year career, is still most beloved for his work within the Sci-Fi genre with the original ALIEN and the neo-futuristic noir BLADE RUNNER. While I don't share most fans' love for ALIEN (I think it's a triumpth of design and style over substance), I do go gaga over the fascinatingly dark and deeply intelligent BLADE RUNNER. So I'm relatively sure that it will anger some people out there that in my opinion, Ridley Scott's return to the Sci-Fi genre after a 30-year absence in PROMETHEUS is a thematically superior film to ALIEN, but will never be a classic such as ALIEN was destined to become.I will never fault a film or its creators for thinking big, and that's definitely what's going on here. Written by master mindbender Damon Lindelof (the love him/hate him co-creator of LOST) and Jon Spaihts (writer of the high-concept flop THE DARKEST HOUR), we start with a bizarre, mood-setting prologue presumably millions of years ago, and then jump to the year 2089 where we have Doctors Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace of the original Swedish MILLENNIUM trilogy) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green, who looks like a stringier Tom Hardy and that character name HAS to be a easter-egg reference to LOST) discovering on Earth a pictographic pattern amongst great civilzations of the past separated by centuries and great distance. They believe it to be a star map and present this to the old, dying trillionaire Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce in convincing old-man makeup) and thus begins the adventure of discovering the origins of Earth's species in a two-year space flight in the massive ship dubbed ""Prometheus"" named for the Greek mythological figure who stole fire from the gods and gave it to humans. Upon arrival at their destination they pulled from this star map which is a moon for the planet LV-223, all of the crew members are awoken from their cryogenic sleep by David (Michael Fassbender), the resident synthetic (or ""artifical person"", if you will). The crew, led by company woman Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron) and the ship's captain Janek (Idris Elba), set down on a moon in this far-flung galaxy. Once there, they start exploring a pyramid-like structure and, in true sci-fi horror fashion, the greatest discovery in scientific history may very well mark the end of our history.The film has a number of problems once things really get underway. My first problems are matters of pet peeves rather than distinct criticisms: I do NOT like it when futuristic films put a specific year on them; just say ""The Future"", or put it so far in the future that this technology may seem charming and antiquated. Also, as in the STAR WARS prequels, it's not a terribly good idea to have technology be more advanced than what we see in the stories that are supposed to come AFTER this. Now comes my real criticisms: Certain members of the crew are such obvious ""red shirts"" that you know they will meet their fate before too long, however that works both ways as a major character meets their fate somewhat early on in the film which does up the ante for all of the crew. Some of the dialogue is clunky, and some character motivations are murky or just plain indecipherable. Noomi Rapace as Dr. Shaw is obviously meant to fit into the Ellen Ripley mold, which is especially apparent during the film's most visceral and suspenseful scene which involves a horrifying self-surgery, but she somehow doesn't quite fit. She's alternately too demure and then too aggressive. There is also a significant reveal that comes near the beginning of the third act that should have more impact than it does, but it just feels inorganic. Also the character of Vickers as being the ""company woman"" for Weyland Industries is designed for you to hate almost immediately; she's far too cold and self-serving. She plays the role very well, but when her character is given a spin that could make her more sympathetic, it doesn't go that way. Even Carter Burke had moments of genuine likability. The character of Janek, as played by Elba, is less of a character and more of a cliche, and it's a sad waste of such a talented actor (He's Stringer Bell, for god's sakes!). And Scott doesn't really have too many edge-of-your-seat moments that a film like this would need particularly in the film's climactic 'battle' which is more of a footnote rather than epic confrontation. Another big problem is that this has essentially already been designed as a franchise rather than a self-contained story. That may be a studio decision (knowing Fox, it probably was), but it still hurts the film more than helps it. And there is a death of another major character in this film that is done so ridiculously that it actually made me kind of angry.However, when the film does work, it REALLY works well. The scenes of initial discovery are incredibly absorbing and the production design work by Arthur Max (designer of every Ridley Scott film since G.I. JANE as well as David Fincher's SE7EN) is stunning to behold. The cinematography of Dariusz Wolski (DP of all of the PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN films, but my favorite work of his is Alex Proyas' underrated masterpiece DARK CITY) is crisp and moody, and the team at Weta Digital who did the effects work did some eye-popping work as well. The philosophical/theological themes and ideas are handled in an intelligent and thought-provoking fashion, and when the suspense is really unleashed, it's far more effective than the large-scale set pieces. The show is essentially stolen right out from everyone else by the brilliant work by Fassbender (who I believe to be one of the hardest working men in the business right now), who is charming and eerie in his childlike fascination, and seems so eager to please, despite his true motives. His moments, even when he's done something truly terrible, are still done with such a benevolence that you know that everything terrible he's doing is not his responsibility, and he does play to a certain regret as he seems to grow throughout the film. Marc Streitenfeld's (also all of Scott's films since AMERICAN GANGSTER) score is somewhat restrained, and that's unusual in a film like this, until the suspense racks up and we're flooded in sound and fury.While this doesn't directly link to the ALIEN franchise, it obviously went out of its way to make sure it was in the same universe, with the whole expedition being financed and overseen by Weyland Industries (which would later become Weyland-Yutani, the company that sent out The Nostromo), and finding these strange and aggressive species on LV-223. As I stated before, this film doesn't present a self-contained story lending itself very obviously to a sequel or entire new franchise for Fox to explore (and eventually exploit, because after all... it's Fox) and so, all the questions that are posed in this film are left relatively unexplored and whether or not we'll see more classical versions of face-huggers, chest-bursters or xenomorphs in future films is up in the air. There is something to work with there both on a thematic and visceral scale, but like the previous ALIEN franchise, it's unlikely that we'll see Ridley Scott returning.I certainly didn't love this film, because when it is good, it's really very good, and when it's bad, it's more innocuous rather than totally debilitating. But unless Fox decides to cede more (or less, depending upon whatever made the film less than stellar) control to the creative team of this film, I'm sure that any further adventures of the remaining crew members of PROMETHEUS might be similarly hamstrung.3.5/5 Stars",4,"Visually arresting and intelligent, but not destined to be a classic.",1342569600,"07 18, 2012",2012,7650,"['Ridley', 'Scott',

Produced by Ridley Scott, David Giler, Walter Hill.Written by Jon Spaihts, Damon Lindelof. Elements from Dan O'Bannon, Ronald Shusett.This is the 7th movie in the series. This is a prequel, a story in the same universe asAliens (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)(1979).After loading in your DVD, a video explains ""The Blu-Ray Experience"". Movie Trailers of Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter (2012), the Raven (2012).On the Earth-like planet, Theshold, a UFO hovers over a raging river. A man, a humanoid (Ian Whyte), with very fair, young and smooth skin, appears next to the river. He opens an orb, which is a bowl of something. He drinks it as if it is an offering. The liquid suddenly changes him. It damages his DNA and begins to disintegrate him. The UFO leaves vertically. The man, in pain, falls into the river and his body breaks apart. He was the last Engineer.Now, we go to the year 2089 on the Isle of Scotland. Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Repace) has found something while clearing rock. It is an opening of a tunnel leading to a cave. She shows Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green). On the cave wall are hand prints from a dye and other drawings. One drawing shows a person pointing at a configuration in the sky. The configuration is one that Shaw and Holloway are familiar with. It is of 5 stars.Now, we go to December 21, 2093.  On the Scientific exploratory vessel, Prometheus, are 17 crew members. Inside, they have a big area for recreation for basketball. They can watch movies like Lawrence of Arabia (1962) and play billiards.  David (Michael Fassbender) gets the crew out of sleep hibernation of 2 years. The vessel has reached their destination.At the meeting, a hologram of Peter Wayland (Guy Pearce), the CEO of the Weyland Corporation, instructs the crew. Then Elizabeth and Holloway explain the drawing they found in the cave in 2089, the same drawing found on other famous tablets of stone found. The configuration is a galactic system with a planet and a sun. Now they have arrived at the planet, Theshold. What they find on this planet is incredible and dangerous.Also in the cast: Charlize Theron, Sean harris, Rafe Spall, Emun Elliott, Benedict Wong, Kate Dickle.Filmed in Dettifoss, Vatnajokull National Park, Iceland.

1475588,A18D87U8CUN0F9,B005LAIHXQ,"Jason Harrington ""Trucker Hater Magazine""","[3, 3]","Acting:I seriously doubt anyone's career will be made or broken based on this, but it was far from the embarrassment of squandering Sigourney Weaver, Winona Ryder, & Ron Perlman the way the 3rd film did. Here, despite the illogical design of the plot, the actors performed at least decently. (Warning: plot spoiler in the next sentence) However, after Charlize Theron's character was killed, then the movie was somewhat balanced on the shoulders of less riveting actors, which even dragged her performance down, when looking back upon this film. Regardless, it was far from her awkwardly overacted Snow White performance. Most of the actors/actresses at least performed on a level well above the gutter-level, where the franchise lost course after A3.Plot:Other reviewers have gone to lengths to explain all the ways the character's decisions made no sense, and it is true that this is typically the key aspect of most plots, however in the case of comic book and science fiction type movie, plot also serves on a macro level to tie-in other chapters, background stories, and to explain or justify supernatural forces which defy common science. So, on a mirco level like a play, this is far from Shakespeare, and the motivations and justifications for each character's actions are wildly skewed, but for me this was merely a vehicle to deliver the actions of placing this group of screw-ups in the right place at the right time to cause the critical error that gave birth to countless nightmares later in the chronology. Of course, the more extreme nerds will not be able to resist the kind of over-analysis that can shred any appreciation of a film like this. But, if no one was stupid in a sci-fi/horror film, then no one would die or make the critical errors that led to this otherwise mostly non-regrettable franchise.Appearance:Clearly the film's strong suit is it's often mind-numbing CGI and the way it blends so seamlessly in most scenes. The only part where the illusion may have been broken a bit was when the robotic guy's head was laying there talking and it just felt like an invisible body, and not the visceral milk-blood robot head that it strove to reference and be similar to, from Alien 3. The rolling ship was a very cool scene, even if it was a little bit of a forced Indiana Jones thing. The hologram parts were very cool, and overall it was money well spent on both the graphics and the special effects make-up. I cannot say as much for the bottled set design or forced toy marketing of Resurrection or Alien Vs Predator 1-2.Overall:The film did it's job of rebooting the franchise, under proper direction. with a fairly ample cast and some flashy technology. Of course the actions and motivations of the characters can tend to be a bit flimsy in a way that does not render cliches into tropes, because it does not really shout-out the sort of films where an idiot going into a dark place is charmingly classic. However, the script was actually written nicely, which is a key element seldom mentioned, and also sorely lacking from the blunder of Resurrection. With enjoyable special effects, a decent script, and mostly ample performances, I don't see a reason why this film is not a suitable addition to the franchise. It is a situation where I am afraid our memory of the early films is greater than the films themselves. The first film was almost entirely shot in the dark and barely showed the alien at all. The second film had a big part played by Paul Riser (the man should have a tattoo that says ""campy""), and the series really only reached fever pitch in the third film, which raised the bar on the franchise only long enough for it to be plunged into the abyss of the next 3 films. So, what hardcore nerds want out of this film is impossible to deliver (much like Star Wars, Evil Dead, Star Trek, etc). It was a great concept in the macro-plot, driven by a clumsy mini-plot, with an ample script, ample acting, and mind-bending graphics.",3,"Not as good as 3, b/ way better than Resurrection",1369699200,"05 28, 2013",2013,3970,"['Acting', 'seriously', 'doubt', 'anyone', 'career', 'will', 'be', 'made', 'broken', 'based', 'was', 'far', 'embarrassment', 'squandering', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'Ron', 'Perlman', 'way', '3rd', 'film', 'did', 'Here', 'illogical', 'design', 'plot', 'actors', 'performed', 'least', 'decently', 'Warning', 'plot', 'spoiler', 'next', 'sentence', 'However', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'character', 'was', 'killed', 'then', 'movie', 'was', 'somewhat', 'balanced', 'shoulders', 'less', 'riveting', 'actors', 'even', 'dragged', 'performance', 'down', 'when', 'looking', 'back', 'film', 'Regardless', 'was', 'far', 'awkwardly', 'overacted', 'Snow', 'White', 'performance', 'Most', 'actors/actresses', 'least', 'performed', 'level', 'well', 'gutter-level', 'where', 'franchise', 'lost', 'course', 'A3.Plot', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'gone', 'lengths', 'explain', 'ways', 'character', 'decisions', 'made', 'sense', 'true', 'typically', 'key', 'aspect', 'most', 'plots', 'however', 'case', 'comic', 'book', 'science', 'fiction', 'type', 'movie', 'plot', 'also', 'macro', 'level', 'tie-in', 'other', 'chapters', 'background', 'stories', 'explain', 'justify', 'supernatural', 'forces', 'defy', 'common', 'science', 'So', 'mirco', 'level', 'play', 'far', 'Shakespeare', 'motivations', 'justifications', 'character', 'actions', 'are', 'wildly', 'skewed', 'was', 'merely', 'vehicle', 'deliver', 'actions', 'placing', 'group', 'screw-ups', 'right', 'place', 'right', 'time', 'cause', 'critical', 'error', 'gave', 'birth', 'countless', 'nightmares', 'later', 'chronology', 'course', 'more', 'extreme', 'nerds', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'resist', 'kind', 'over-analysis', 'can', 'shred', 'appreciation', 'film', 'one', 'was', 'stupid', 'sci-fi/horror', 'film', 'then', 'one', 'would', 'die', 'make', 'critical', 'errors', 'led', 'otherwise', 'mostly', 'non-regrettable', 'franchise.Appearance', 'Clearly', 'film', 'strong', 'suit', 'often', 'mind-numbing', 'CGI', 'way', 'so', 'seamlessly', 'most', 'scenes', 'only', 'part', 'where', 'illusion', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'broken', 'bit', 'was', 'when', 'robotic', 'guy', 'head', 'was', 'laying', 'there', 'talking', 'just', 'felt', 'invisible', 'body', 'not', 'visceral', 'milk-blood', 'robot', 'head', 'strove', 'reference', 'be', 'similar', 'Alien', '3', 'rolling', 'ship', 'was', 'very', 'cool', 'scene', 'even', 'was', 'little', 'bit', 'forced', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'thing', 'hologram', 'parts', 'were', 'very', 'cool', 'overall', 'was', 'money', 'well', 'spent', 'graphics', 'special', 'effects', 'make-up', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'much', 'bottled', 'set', 'design', 'forced', 'marketing', 'Resurrection', 'Alien', 'Vs', 'Predator', '1-2.Overall', 'film', 'did', 'job', 'rebooting', 'franchise', 'proper', 'direction', 'fairly', 'ample', 'cast', 'flashy', 'technology', 'course', 'actions', 'motivations', 'characters', 'can', 'tend', 'be', 'bit', 'flimsy', 'way', 'not', 'render', 'cliches', 'tropes', 'not', 'really', 'shout-out', 'sort', 'films', 'where', 'idiot', 'going', 'dark', 'place', 'charmingly', 'classic', 'However', 'script', 'was', 'actually', 'written', 'nicely', 'key', 'element', 'seldom', 'mentioned', 'also', 'sorely', 'lacking', 'blunder', 'Resurrection', 'enjoyable', 'special', 'effects', 'decent', 'script', 'mostly', 'ample', 'performances', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'reason', 'why', 'film', 'not', 'suitable', 'addition', 'franchise', 'situation', 'where', 'am', 'afraid', 'memory', 'early', 'films', 'greater', 'films', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'almost', 'entirely', 'shot', 'dark', 'barely', 'showed', 'alien', 'second', 'film', 'had', 'big', 'part', 'played', 'Paul', 'Riser', 'man', 'should', 'have', 'tattoo', 'campy', 'series', 'really', 'only', 'reached', 'fever', 'pitch', 'third', 'film', 'raised', 'bar', 'franchise', 'only', 'long', 'enough', 'be', 'plunged', 'abyss', 'next', '3', 'films', 'So', 'what', 'hardcore', 'nerds', 'want', 'film', 'impossible', 'deliver', 'much', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'Star', 'Trek', 'etc', 'was', 'great', 'concept', 'macro-plot', 'driven', 'clumsy', 'mini-plot', 'ample', 'script', 'ample', 'acting', 'mind-bending', 'graphics']",N/A

And Charlize Theron's character was too one-dimensional. She actually was the robot of the film. And sorry folks, but even if ""Avatar"" wasn't the best script ever written, it did wonders when it came to making us discover an alien world. After that, a movie who wants to do the same thing must be better or else, what's the point?When a talented director like Ridley Scott makes an error of judgment like that, it makes you wonder about his previous films. Maybe those films didn't come from his mind, after all. Maybe he is simply a director. Maybe he always was lucky and had great scripwriters. And for this one, he wasn't lucky and he had not-so-good scriptwriters. And since he obviously cannot make the difference between a good story and a bad one, well he did it anyway. That is the only explication. Ridley Scott is not so wise after all. He is simply a doer. A director who directs.I'm sure it's not that. But c'mon! ""Prometheus"" cannot come from Ridley Scott. It's worthy of Michael Bay, in terms of dialogues and character's motivation. And for the great critic Roger Ebert to praise this film, well it's beyond me. The humans in this film diserves to be eaten by the bad aliens.

Meade,"[0, 1]","I liked Prometheus, but I really enjoy sci-fi books and movies so I tend to have a good time even when the story or other elements are somewhat mediocre.I have read some of the other reviews and there are many points I would agree with. In hindsight some of the decisions made by the characters in the movie really don't make much sense. A few of those decisions are extremely stupid. Yeah, petting the thing that looks like a pissed off snake is probably a bad idea. There are some pretty hilarious reviews out there pointing out all the dumb decisions that were made throughout the movie.Where I disagree with some of the other reviews is regarding David and the crew. I saw David as a emotionless robot that was given a specific agenda by his ""creator"". Sometimes he seemed almost evil, but he was making decisions like a computer would and not based on actual emotional connections. As for the crew, the movie takes place more than 75 years in the future, but we are watching it and seeing it through the eyes of the world we live in today. The movie doesn't at all discuss the state of the planet, its technology, or space exploration, but quite a bit can be inferred from what we do see. Space travel is most likely very normal with jobs in space being common so who makes up the crew didn't really seem strange to me, especially considering it was a private company paying for the mission and not the government.The cast did a good job, though I was disappointed to see Charlize Theron so under-utilized when she is capable of so much more. I enjoyed Noomi Rapace as the main character and Michael Fassbender did do a really good job playing a character that seemed both good and bad at different times which means he was a great robot for the movie.As for the movies connection to the original Alien movies, Prometheus does do a good job of answering some things, but it also leaves you really scratching your head asking the question Why quite a few times. Why exactly were the aliens on that moon? Was it really just a place to create biological weapons? Why would the aliens create us and then want to destroy us? Why were they using the methods they did and not just super nukes or a disease that kills everyone? When the last living alien realized the crew was from Earth its reaction was to start killing everyone. Why? Are they just evil? Is there something about humanity that we don't know? I also want to know why that alien in the beginning of the movie killed himself and where the huge spaceship was going. The questions can go on and on, and it looks like a sequel is in the works that will officially bridge the gap between Prometheus and the original Alien movies.

Besides that, before breathing any unknown atmosphere you must first study it's chemical and biological makeup before even attempting to breath it. Yet, what is the first thing they do?

1475614,A9LSLYQW28X6H,B005LAIHXQ,Jeff Van Gastel,"[0, 0]","Like many reviews on here, I was very excited to view Prometheus when it came out.  Unfortunately, I did not have the time, and thus had to wait until it came out on DVD.  In the meantime I had read the reviews, and my enthusiasm for the movie waned a bit.  Though, after watching Prometheus recently, I was pleasantly surprised with the movie, and a bit disappointed with parts as well.The movie is beautiful to watch.  From the opening scenes of the Engineer by the waterfall, to the scenes on LV-223 within both the Prometheus and the Engineer's spaceship.  There were scenes tying into the Aliens Universe if you looked hard enough, and enough new territory to make this something new in that Universe.I thought the acting for the most part was very well done.  Michael Fassbender as David, the cyborg, was excellent, especially his scenes with Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron) and Dr. Shaw (Noomi Rapace).  Both those ladies did a fantastic job, as did Idris Elba as the Prometheus's Captain.  Logan Marshall-Green's performance as Dr. Holloway was a bit stiff, however Guy Pearce had a complete old-man makeover as Peter Weyland, the CEO of Weyland Corp.  It took me 5 minutes of viewing before I realized that it was even Guy Pearce.  I should have listened more to the voice.Definitely some of the more frustrating things of the movie was the way the crew reacted when they encounter the Engineer ship,and some of the scenes within.  As others have recounted:  the taking off of the helmets, the two crew getting ""lost"" within the spaceship, not being ultra-careful with many ominous canisters lined up in the ""Head"" room, ect...The Extra's featured on the Blu-Ray & Digital Copy:*  Deleted & Alternate Scenes - A couple were interesting, and a couple were not.  Not many for a long film.  I did like the scene where at the beginning where they decided to do 1 Engineer rather than many.*  Peter Weyland Files -  4 short files on Weyland's computer.  1 is of a speech made by Weyland in 2023, however I liked the one of an Infomercial for David the Cyborg.*  Prometheus Mobile App so you can interact with your smartphone or tablet when the movie is on.*  Commentary by writer Jon Spaihts and writer/ex producer Damon Lindelof.*  Commentary by director/producer Ridley Scott.I did really enjoy this movie, even with some of the more frustrating behaviors of the crew, and many questions being unanswered.  I have heard this is part 1 of a trilogy, so hopefully our questions will be answered in the future.",4,I Think They Want Us To Come And Find Them,1357689600,"01 9, 2013",2013,2516,"['many', 'reviews', 'here', 'was', 'very', 'excited', 'view', 'Prometheus', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'Unfortunately', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'time', 'thus', 'had', 'wait', 'came', 'out', 'DVD', 'meantime', 'had', 'read', 'reviews', 'enthusiasm', 'movie', 'waned', 'bit', 'Though', 'watching', 'Prometheus', 'recently', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'movie', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'parts', 'well.The', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'watch', 'opening', 'scenes', 'Engineer', 'waterfall', 'scenes', 'LV-223', 'Prometheus', 'Engineer', 'spaceship', 'were', 'scenes', 'tying', 'Aliens', 'Universe', 'looked', 'hard', 'enough', 'enough', 'new', 'territory', 'make', 'something', 'new', 'Universe.I', 'thought', 'acting', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'David', 'cyborg', 'was', 'excellent', 'especially', 'scenes', 'Meredith', 'Vickers', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'Dr.', 'Shaw', 'Noomi', 'Rapace', 'ladies', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'did', 'Idris', 'Elba', 'Prometheus', 'Captain', 'Logan', 'Marshall-Green', 'performance', 'Dr.', 'Holloway', 'was', 'bit', 'stiff', 'however', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'had', 'complete', 'old-man', 'makeover', 'Peter', 'Weyland', 'CEO', 'Weyland', 'Corp', 'took', '5', 'minutes', 'viewing', 'realized', 'was', 'even', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'should', 'have', 'listened', 'more', 'voice.Definitely', 'more', 'frustrating', 'things', 'movie', 'was', 'way', 'crew', 'reacted', 'when', 'encounter', 'Engineer', 'ship', 'scenes', 'others', 'have', 'recounted', 'taking', 'off', 'helmets', 'two', 'crew', 'getting', 'lost', 'spaceship', 'not', 'being', 'ultra-careful', 'many', 'ominous', 'canisters', 'lined', 'up', 'Head', 'room', 'ect', 'Extra', 'featured', 'Blu-Ray', 'Digital', 'Copy', '*', 'Deleted', 'Alternate', 'Scenes', 'couple', 'were', 'interesting', 'couple', 'were', 'not', 'Not', 'many', 'long', 'film', 'did', 'scene', 'where', 'beginning', 'where', 'decided', 'do', '1', 'Engineer', 'rather', 'many', '*', 'Peter', 'Weyland', 'Files', '4', 'short', 'files', 'Weyland', 'computer', '1', 'speech', 'made', 'Weyland', '2023', 'however', 'liked', 'one', 'Infomercial', 'David', 'Cyborg', '*', 'Prometheus', 'Mobile', 'App', 'can', 'interact', 'smartphone', 'tablet', 'when', 'movie', '*', 'Commentary', 'writer', 'Jon', 'Spaihts', 'writer/ex', 'producer', 'Damon', 'Lindelof', 'Commentary', 'director/producer', 'Ridley', 'Scott.I', 'did', 'really', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'even', 'more', 'frustrating', 'behaviors', 'crew', 'many', 'questions', 'being', 'unanswered', 'have', 'heard', 'part', '1', 'trilogy', 'so', 'hopefully', 'questions', 'will', 'be', 'answered', 'future']",N/A

Stop expecting ANYTHING from this title.  That is the problem we seem to be having:  the hype and expectations.  We've all done it now and then.  You know, get drawn into trailers and think the film will be like that.  You think we would have learned by now, but we never do.  That simple little fact that trailers are rarely, if ever, are what the movie will play out.Blink away trailers, cast/director interviews, and random rumor mills.  Walk into this film with open eyes.  Expect nothing and get your head in the mindset that this is a stand-alone Sci-Fi film, not connected to any other film.  Do that and you will enjoy it more.  Any attempts to connect it to Alien franchise or fall for the trailer hype and the film will be ruined.Now, if you walk into this as a stand-alone film, it isn't that bad.  Yeah, some things don't make sense like why super intelligent being would act so simplistically or how a football sized critter grows to huge proportions without a food source.  But, it is a Sci-Fi film we are talking about.  We have to roll the dice and let some things slide.  No one watched Jaws and got hung up on how the shark got to the island, after all, right?Is it an instant classic?  Nope.  Is it the worse thing ever captured on film?  Of course not.  It is a nice, middle of the road film that is a good way to kill just over 2 hours, with trailers.

What's stopping it, apart from a minor technicality of the planet's name being slightly different? Nothing, really. So it's the prequel I was expecting.Other than that, it's just a matter of gritting my teeth and accepting that creating weird imagery that exists solely for the purpose of being weird, no matter the logic behind it (see: the entirety of Lost) is just something that Lindelof does and, somehow, keeps being paid to do.

1475626,A2SJ7L8QB52WDW,B005LAIHXQ,jgcrackerass,"[1, 2]","I had heard a lot of bad things about this movie from critics so when I first watched it I didn't know what to expect. Lots of people said it was confusing or full of holes and not really a prequel but a side-ways blah blah whatever. I have no idea what any of them are talking about. The plot was fairly simple and easy to follow. The idea was well laid out and not at all confusing. It was a very direct prequel to Alien. There was no beating around the bush, no questions about anything. The ending left it open for more story to be told, but certainly didn't leave much unanswered.The movie was visually, probably the best movie I've ever seen. To explain that a little better, the CGI didn't look like CGI, it looked real. It was like a cross between CGI and rubber suit technology. CGI always leaves me feeling like I just watched a cartoon and a rubber suit always leaves me feeling like I just watched a guy in a rubber suit run around. When the creatures featured here did their creature feature thing (say that 5 times fast) it left me with the feeling of; wow that was awesome.The chick from the dragon tattoo flicks did an extremely impressive job of equaling (if not surpassing) Sigourney's B.A. sci-fi chick image. She went from delicate religious flower to (Spoiler Alert (sort of))""I'm going to go ahead and carve myself up like a pumpkin to survive"" in a relatively small amount of time. The most impressive thing about this transformation was it didn't seem rushed or false, it just seemed like she was truly terrified, and had no choice but to suck it up and take it like a boss.One thing a lot of people harp on, that I totally agree with was the scientists did a lot of really dumb stuff. I would argue though, that they were put under quite a bit of duress before they started acting ignorantly. I'm sorry, but if I'm on an alien planet and I discover the very first signs of life outside of Earth and then immediately discover that those signs of life were killed heinously by unknown assailants that may or may not still be lurking around the spooky caves I'm in, I'd probably experience a slightly heightened stress level. This could possibly be accompanied by a slightly lowered ability to properly assess my surroundings and act with the utmost clarity of thought. The scenes in particular that people are harping on, can be paralleled pretty easily to the original Alien film, which nobody seems to be harping on. Would I let in a crazy zombie-alien infected crew mate? Hopefully not, but I wouldn't let in a crew mate that had a giant spider-squid stuck to his face either. The thing we have to realize about horror movies in general is, if nobody did anything that allowed them to be put in terrifying situations, the movie wouldn't be scary. This is a movie about two scientists that want to find the origins of life, and a bunch of support staff that could care less about that and just want to get paid. The exception is of course, the always questionably unethical android that may or may not be working for ""the company."" If those scientists didn't want to go out and explore, the movie wouldn't have gone anywhere. It would have been about a spaceship that landed on an alien planet whose crew then did nothing except say ""this looks like it might get a little scary, lets fly back home for 3 years and report that it looked scary so we did nothing."" According to the critics, this is what would have made the film more realistic and therefore, more watchable. I respectfully disagree. Sometimes making stupid mistakes is what people do. That makes it more realistic than having a ship full of 180 IQ nuclear physicists that never make any mistakes or act questionably.I guess what I'm trying to say is, this movie was awesome.

Griffiths,"[0, 2]","This review is based on the Amazon Instant Video HD version (I mention this because you don't get the extra material at the end in the Standard Def. version) I can't believe all the people that said they are big fans of the Alien movies that said this movie has nothing to do with that series. The Aliens in this movie are the same aliens that were found in the first movie. I'm referring to the dead alien found in the pilots chair inside the alien space ship. They don't look the same because the alien in the first movie was wearing a space suit. The same space suit that is seen at the first encounter with the aliens in this movie. To make this more clear, in this movie  there are 2 alien life forms in the movie. A human like alien and a monster like octopus alien that starts out like a worm. This movie takes place before the first Alien movie. Another misconception is the one where the humans had touched the alien goo, and how dumb that was. Watch the movie again but more closely this time. It's the android that does all the touching of the alien substances . I didn't see this movie in the theater because of all the criticisms. And I have to admit that the previews made the movie look dumb. But after I saw it I thought it was mostly misunderstood. But I had the advantage of reading the reviews and I was looking for what was said regarding the dumb things that were reported. As my title says, after the credits there are scenes that were cut out and should not have been that show a more recognizable alien bursting through the chest of the human like alien. As stated in the first Alien movie, these creatures take on DNA from their host that changes their appearance. So what you see in this movie as far as the octopus like creature becomes the aliens that were in all the other movies. I've got enough spoilers in my review and I'm sorry for that but I thought there was to much confusion (and intentional misdirection from Dir. Scott) to just review the movie. There have been a number of poorly made Alien Vs Predator movies recently and that's probably why Mr Scott said that this wasn't another Alien movie like the previous ones.So do I recommend this movie? Well if you know the difference between interesting SIFI and Horror SIFI, then I would say it's good interesting SIFI. But if your looking for a movie more like Aliens where the monster aliens eat everybody, or turn them into incubator's hanging from slim covered walls, and lots of machine gun action and space marines then your out of luck. Mr Scott has made a movie that's more like there were no other sequels to Alien until this one. I would suggest anyone that wants to make more sents of this movie watch the first one again, then this one and rather then paying close attention to the action, and all the other visual attractions, listen to and remember what's being said. you'll find there some interesting connections.",4,Watch thru the credits.

1475644,AXCVJPP41H8BA,B005LAIHXQ,"Jim Van Cise ""Caffeine Anthropologist""","[5, 6]","I'm reviewing the 4 disc set. It's not unusual for a DVD to have a lot of deleted scenes but this time you need them all to flesh out the overly refined theatrical release. The 3.5 hour documentary on disc 3 is worth the extra money but I will never buy a new Blu-ray a mere 5 weeks from Black Friday ever again. There is enough here to be very thought provoking which is the mark of an unforgettable movie. I spent an hour online when I got home from after seeing this for the first time. I had a ton of questions but I have to say that repeated viewings has improved my opinion of Prometheus. Fresh out of the theater, I would have had trouble giving this more than 3 stars. I noticed when the DVD was released that the film seemed to have been rebranded to renew interest. The engineer wasn't shown in any of the theatrical release commercials or print ads but the DVD cover features a close up of the unmasked engineer. Prometheus may not be a prequel but unfortunately, there are so many coincidences that most people will leave the theater believing that they saw the derelict ship from Alien crash on LV-426. I think of my years spent wondering if the Alien had a home planet or was made to be a bioweapon. Ridley leaves enough hanging to spark debate and trade theories. It's ambiguous. I also hang onto the tension of whether or not Rick Deckard is a replicant. By the way, the franchises for Alien and Blade Runner have more in common right now than ever in my opinion. I've probably said this in another review but the more you know about a character, the less interesting they become. Boba Fett and Hannibal Lecter are good examples. These characters could all come from the same Earth where Tyrell and Weyland are one and the same or competitive rivals. One thing I did have in mind before I saw the movie was a tip from a friend who told me to Google: ""Prometheus Flow Chart"". There's a chart with icons illustrating the four possible outcomes. Even if you're already clear on the squid/zombie/human/alien biology, it's worth a look.",4,The DVD Release Has Plenty of Damage Control,1354492800,"12 3, 2012",2012,2047,"[""'m"", 'reviewing', '4', 'disc', 'set', 'not', 'unusual', 'DVD', 'have', 'lot', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'time', 'need', 'flesh', 'out', 'overly', 'refined', 'theatrical', 'release', '3.5', 'hour', 'documentary', 'disc', '3', 'extra', 'money', 'will', 'never', 'buy', 'new', 'Blu-ray', 'mere', '5', 'weeks', 'Black', 'Friday', 'ever', 'again', 'enough', 'here', 'be', 'very', 'thought', 'provoking', 'mark', 'unforgettable', 'movie', 'spent', 'hour', 'online', 'when', 'got', 'home', 'seeing', 'first', 'time', 'had', 'ton', 'questions', 'have', 'say', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'improved', 'opinion', 'Prometheus', 'Fresh', 'theater', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'trouble', 'giving', 'more', '3', 'stars', 'noticed', 'when', 'DVD', 'was', 'released', 'film', 'seemed', 'have', 'been', 'rebranded', 'renew', 'interest', 'engineer', 'was', ""n't"", 'shown', 'theatrical', 'release', 'commercials', 'print', 'ads', 'DVD', 'cover', 'close', 'unmasked', 'engineer', 'Prometheus', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'prequel', 'unfortunately', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'coincidences', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'leave', 'theater', 'believing', 'saw', 'derelict', 'ship', 'Alien', 'crash', 'LV-426', 'think', 'years', 'spent', 'wondering', 'Alien', 'had', 'home', 'planet', 'was', 'made', 'be', 'bioweapon', 'Ridley', 'enough', 'hanging', 'spark', 'debate', 'trade', 'theories', 'ambiguous', 'also', 'hang', 'tension', 'not', 'Rick', 'Deckard', 'replicant', 'way', 'franchises', 'Alien', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'have', 'more', 'common', 'right', 'now', 'ever', 'opinion', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'said', 'review', 'more', 'know', 'character', 'less', 'interesting', 'become', 'Boba', 'Fett', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', 'are', 'good', 'examples', 'characters', 'could', 'come', 'same', 'Earth', 'where', 'Tyrell', 'Weyland', 'are', 'one', 'same', 'competitive', 'rivals', 'One', 'thing', 'did', 'have', 'mind', 'saw', 'movie', 'was', 'tip', 'friend', 'who', 'told', 'Google', 'Prometheus', 'Flow', 'Chart', 'chart', 'icons', 'illustrating', 'four', 'possible', 'outcomes', 'Even', ""'re"", 'already', 'clear', 'squid/zombie/human/alien', 'biology', 'look']",N/A

He drinks a potion out of a sealed vessel. His body begins to disintegrate and he falls into the flowing water of a waterfall as his DNA dissolves and seeds the Earth for human life.Flash forward to 2089 where scientists find a cave in Scotland with ancient cave paintings showing people worshiping a giant alien who is pointing to a star cluster painted on the ceiling of the cave. It is the same star cluster as painted in numerous cave paintings found around the world and made by civilizations separated by thousands of miles and thousands of years. Is it an invitation to come visit the home world of the race that created mankind?In 2093 Prometheus is nearing the end of its journey to find the source of the alien message. It is 200 trillion miles from earth and its crew of 17 is awakened by the ship's systems and the on board robot who has cared for the ship during their sleep. Will they find the clues about the origins of mankind or unlock Pandora's Box....This movie is touted as a prequel to the Alien series of movies. It has a great story line and a good cast so the movie had a lot of potential. I wind up rating it as a 4 star film but it was somewhere between a 3 and a 4 star movie. The special effects were very good and the acting was also above average. What lowered the movie in my opinion was the silliness of the script and the actions of the characters.If you were to write down the 10 to 15 things that any intelligent person would not do in the event of an alien encounter while on another planet and watch this movie then you would see them do every one of them in about 2 hours. What is it with Hollywood that makes them think that having characters behave like this is entertaining?This movie had the potential to be a 5 star movie as the premise was excellent. The execution of the characters behavior was just outlandishly silly. I will not list the flaws of the movie here because it would expose too much of the details of the film but to me it dropped the films rating. I gave it a 3 star rating and my wife gave it a 4. Since my feeling was between a 3 and a 4 star I compromised to a 4 star.The movie is reasonably entertaining it just is not spectacular in its production. It is now where near as scary, entertaining or suspenseful as the first Alien movie with Sigourney Weaver.

1475659,A1KRNQWUNCTJS3,B005LAIHXQ,joebobhenrybob,"[9, 14]","The real review is relatively short and separated from the following rant for ease in reading...You could watch instead:Planet Of The VampiresForbidden PlanetThe ThingThis is about as bad a prequel as Phantom Menace - if anything it may be worse.Overall, it appears to be bad for roughly the same reasons.First, like the Star Wars prequels, the director seems to have started with a bunch of scenes they wanted to do for special effects reasons, then attempted to stitch them together after the fact.  Like Star Wars, the overall concept of what the movie is about and specific scenes either fail to connect or conflict.The characters are illogical and make mistakes, yes, but on a more basic level, they don't make sense as people.  Characters are driven by emotion not logic, so we can't fault them for making the occasional mistake, but the characters act with no motivation or in a way that invalidates previously-established motivation or basic aspects of their character.  As a result, I don't like, relate to, care about any of these characters.  I'm a little bit intrigued by the android until he too turns out to be nonsensical.  By making the actions of people incoherent, contradictory, stupid, and inconsistent, they're made into non-characters.  They aren't believable as people.I'd say there isn't much of a plot, an actual narrative per se.  There is no discernable character arc for any of the characters.  You could describe what happens on their mission in a sentence or two.The film is awfully derivative - there seems to be a lot of borrowing from different places.  Maybe Leviathan.  And Stargate.  Most of this film stole scenes or concepts directly from Alien vs Predator, Alien, and Aliens.  However, the award goes to Star Trek Next Generation season 6 episode 20 The Chase, in which an ancient humanoid race referred to as The Founders is sought by scientists due to the result of archaeological research and found to have seeded their own DNA billions of years ago on other planets, giving rise to other humanoid races including of course humans.  They're kind of albino-ish looking with strong brow ridges and bald heads.So overall, I'd say if you watch something like Forbidden Planet or Planet of the Vampires, you'll be more satisfied.  Maybe even more satisfied with The Green Slime...end of the overview.  But I can't resist going into a few more specific diatribes...========================Some specific examples of bad filmakingLAZY characterization.  The lead female scientist has ""faith.""  Not in Christianity per se but just a generally faith-y disney-its-maaagic kinda person.  How do we know?  Other characters tell her she's a ""believer"" several times and she wears a cross.  Yet she's following a line of thinking that directly contradicts the cross she wears.  Maybe she'd have been more believable if she was referred to as a ""dreamer"" and ""mystic.""  ...show her hanging a dreamcatcher over her bed, reading Crowley and Chariots of the Gods, have her talk about a few other off-the-wall ideas to establish a general hunger for strangeness and hidden mystery.  As it was, she was a person with two diametrically opposed beliefs and no inner tension.  Worse, she's a scientist and a Christian but believes - without specific evidence - that the figures in various ancient illustrations created humanity so she strays from BOTH her main character traits - her faith and her science.  A person who doesn't even value their own values is difficult to like as a protagonist.LAZY science fiction - they reference ""ancient civilizations"" all having the same star map and include Cave Men, the Mayans, and the Babylonians.  So you've got cave painters from 40,000BC, Babylonians from 1700BC, and Mayans from 250-900 AD cited as all ancient and all having the same star map.  What, they didn't want to drop off the same map for Atilla, Constantine, Diocletian or Charlemagne?  With the other civilizations cited, it implies Engineers being constantly on earth interacting with humans for essentially all of human history.  So they were around for 41,000 years, THEN decided they felt like getting rid of us, then at that convenient moment - but not anytime in the 40,000 years before - destroyed themselves with their own weapons just at the perfect moment - and apparently the Engineers at this one facility were the only ones to know this needed to be done.If we are to believe the Engineer in the first shot was on a very early earth, we should remember life started maybe 3.5 BILLION years ago which is a long wait to decide you made a bad go of it.  But let's assume they only intended to modify existing life.  You'd probably need to arrive close to the development of invertabrates to at least have some chance of influencing local evolution to lead to an Engineer-like creature so they could have shown up for the Cambrian explosion which still gives them about 580 MILLION years to mull over the fate of all life on Earth.Of course, to think that various influences that cause mutation leading to evolution - such as cosmic radiation hitting the earth for 580 million years straight - not to mention evolutionary pressures ie a different environment/planet - could possibly allow for CONVERGENT evolution leading to a specific body plan reveals a deep, deep non-understanding of science in general and in multiple disciplines.  Like, this was what they wanted the movie to be ABOUT but they couldn't be bothered to crack a single book on the subject?  Does the story of Prometheus take place in a heliocentric universe by chance?  Or is the Earth flat?  Are humans assumed to be composed of 4 substances/humors?LAZY writing and choice of scenes.  A surprising amount of time in Prometheus is spent setting up the same scenario as a single scene in Aliens - the same plot with the same exact plan - the evil Corporation plans to expose a human being to alien contagion, then transport them back to Earth in suspended animation.  In Aliens, it was a quick, suspenseful scene and it made sense - the corporate guy did it because he was seeking profit at everyone else's expense.  In Prometheus, it doesn't make any sense.  The android has no personal motivation to do it and the guy who owns and controls the corporation is THERE onboard for a completely different purpose than profit - in fact, introducing an uncontrolled unknown never before studied contagion on board could greatly threaten his project and of course his life.  Why do they do it then?  Not for any goal but because er... it's what happened in another Alien movie so... it happens because that's what happens in these movies?  Like, Ridley Scott wanted to make a non-Aliens prequel that was big-concept and thoughtful and did new things... therefore decided he needed to RE-DO the same thing covered by Cameron in the first alien sequel??? WTF?  Lazy, lazy writing to rehash a previously - and well - explored idea.  Characters that work against their own purposes.  If they KNEW a monster would result from the trick, having it inside the ship would kill the crew and perhaps the billionaire and thus ruin his mission and end his life when he came there to extend his life - or if they had no idea what it would do, it hardly made sense to set it loose outside of a lab environment, considering how paranoid they were about living in a lifeboat.Most of the movie is taken up with people doing things that make no sense and things that make no sense happening.  Even making no sense in terms of the plot or story or just the basic idea for the film - such as why rehash previously explored Alien movie subplots? - the movie is about the big picture, alien ""gods"" as opposed to alien monsters... but the Engineer we meet is essentially indistinguishable from the no longer sentient crazed spider-monkey former crew member that goes berzerk.Or having the automated medical system software not have any directions loaded for females - wouldn't it come standard?  Wouldn't the old millionaire want it to be capable of helping his daughter who he was dependent on while he was in coldsleep?  Moreover, shouldn't it be unable to operate at all under those conditions?  These are all considerations that reveal the movie as stupid... But consider it from the writer's perspective from outside the story - they planned to have this character do the decathalon within 24 hours of a cesarean section.  Sprinting, jumping, getting smashed by an alien and thrown across the room, jumping and landing heavily on things, climbing, more sprinting, more climbing... assuming the writers decided the same character MUST go through both the operation and feats of athleticism instead of using two different characters or giving her time to heal, do you really want to go out of your way to have the medical system state it is not equipped to take care of women?  Maybe you could argue that futuristic technology makes it all possible but not when you have that technology itself tell the audience it isn't set up to help.  Dumb nonsensical writing.Alien was about a bunch of space-truckers who get re-routed from their normal job by their employer unexpectedly and run into something they can't handle.  They're essentially expendables for a corporation who thinks first of profit and last of their safety.  Despite the fact that they aren't scientists, they still worry about basic safety things like quarantine.  Conversely, the owner of the corporation himself takes his A team out on a mission with him for the purpose of saving himself from death and they appear to be universally foolish, incompetent, and generally not A personality types.  They don't seem to have much concern for each other or even their own lives let alone their jobs.  You'd want a cast of sophisticated scientists and professionals for Prometheus to replace the hapless space-truckers of Alien because you want characters capable of the kind of nuanced, depthful discussions and actions needed to address the ""big questions"" of the film.  Instead you have a badly written teenage slasher film with some of the best special effects ever.  I recommend Scream or I Know What You Did Last Summer over Prometheus.===============...a small example of character development/character arc in Prometheus:Shaw:(dreamily, flakily) ""I want to visit that planet, because I believe they are our creators, and I want to meet them.

and one of their ships with a flight path they'll be able to follow back to this planet, where they'll find the remains of our own ship and our intact lifeboat, both full of information - the navigation databases certainly showing the location of Earth along with, most likely, every major human settlement. ...so I can ask them why.""",1,surprisingly disappointing even to those expecting

1475683,A356HRZZFCEGL1,B005LAIHXQ,"John Panagopoulos ""John Andrew Panagopoulos""","[0, 2]","***This review may contain spoilers***Yes, I'm late to the party.  This would-be science-fiction epic has already garnered over 3,100 Amazon.com reviews with little danger of abating.  Therefore, I'm probably adding no new insights into ""Prometheus"".  This review most likely adheres to the criticism most 1-, 2-, and even 3-star reviews have already observed: ""The movie is just about flawless technically, cinematographically, and conceptually, but juvenile and superficial (for the most part) in character creation and motivation.""  Arthur J. Bullock's Question and Answer format Amazon.com review has already ingeniously encapsulated my and many others' views of logic lapses in ""Prometheus"".  So, what's left to say?  Well, I guess I'll just basically summarize the aforementioned logic lapses with the opinion that the Prometheus crew's lack of professional discipline grievously hinders the movie.Contrary to what others believed, I felt that the numerous petroglyphs outlining the Engineers' frequent visits to Earth ostensibly to initiate life were sufficient incentive to organize an outer space expedition to contact these progenitors (even if they DID look like albino bodybuilders).  What irked me was the unlikelihood that a private corporation would be permitted, or even have the resources, to attempt this interstellar flight.  I would have thought that searching for humanity's origins should be a paramount international matter.  And yet somehow the wizened, apparently deceased Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce, looking like Goldmember from the third Austin Powers movie) has scraped together a trillion dollars (I guess quintillionaires exist in the 2090's) for the half-baked purpose of going to the Engineers' solar system to somehow find an elixir of youth and immortality.  Even more baffling, instead of amassing the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me of biologists, geologists, archeologists, and other -ologists, Weyland decided to select the motliest of crews for this little space trip.  With the exception of the competent, devout but intellectually curious, and surprisingly scrappy Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and the near-infallible but disregarded and even faintly malevolent and enigmatic android David (Michael Fassbender), the crew is an unorganized joke.In actual charge of the gargantuan ""Prometheus"" vessel is the sinister, irritable icicle Meredith Vickers, with a gradually revealed connection to Weyland.  The rugged, capable Captain Janek (Idris Elba) is reduced to being a passive spaceship chauffeur. Dr. Shaw's colleague and love interest Dr. Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) is cocky, brash, unkempt, and unwisely disdainful of David.  Rounding out this ragtag gallery is the really unprincipled doofus duo Fifield (Sean Harris) the geologist and Millburn (Rafe Spall) the biologist, who turn out to be the equivalent of the ""red shirt"" officers in Star Trek.  What a bunch of winners!No Prometheus crew member - not even Dr. Shaw or David - follows any kind of protocol or discipline, military or otherwise.  They seemingly act as if they're on some pleasure cruise, with time to play pool, swig vodka, make bets, and make love.  Captain Janek occasionally and vainly issues orders.  Usually he's idly staring at the schematic of the Engineer cavern stronghold on moon LV-223 or playing his squeezebox.  Everyone else does whatever the hell they want without supervision, including Dr. Shaw's do-it-yourself Caesarean to extract a squid fetus.  Therefore, it's relatively easy for David to explore the cavern, decipher the hieroglyphics, get samples of the Engineers' DNA ooze, and ""vengefully"" start the mutation havoc onboard the ship.  Again, I recommend you read Mr. Bullock's review to get an outline of the genetic blunders the crew foolishly unleashes upon themselves that utterly unravels the mission for almost everyone.Watching this movie, I couldn't help thinking that, for all the time-worn techno-prattle and tired, corny humanistic themes, the Star Trek crew (whether Captain Kirk's or Picard's) would have handled the momentous events on LV-223 more professionally and competently.  Certainly some crew members would have been infected and even killed, but the main characters would have thoroughly analyzed the terrain, the Engineer corpses, the caverns, and the pods before going into action.  The crew would also have heeded any information from Spock or Data and acted appropriately.  Furthermore, the Star Trek crew would have had time to address evolutionary, theological, and even ethical implications of the missions meaningfully.  Star Trek naval discipline would have made more epochal discoveries about the Engineers without blowing up their ship. But then again, this discipline would have bored some Ridley Scott or ""Alien"" fans who wanted their icky snake/squid/slimy tentacle thingie fix.What a waste of a evolutionary/theological vision!  Dr. Shaw is practically the only Prometheus member still curious about the Engineers.  Others, like the doomed Dr. Holloway, thought that the revelation of the human/Engineer 100% genetic matchup solved the problem - Humanity comes from Engineers.  Dr. Shaw perceptively retorts ""Who made the Engineers?""  The mystery continues, and only she and David's head are still around to pursue it (in the Prometheus sequel).  Perhaps the sequel will also answer the questions 1) Are the Engineers attempting to correct their run-amok planetary DNA sowing, including that of Earth's?, 2)What did David say to infuriate the resuscitated, murderous Engineer?, 3) Where is the ""Neck-Pillow Shaped"" Engineer spaceship escaping to?, 4) Can Dr. Shaw and David follow them in another ""Neck-Pillow Shaped"" spaceship?, 5) Can Dr. Shaw really trust David? 6) How will the surprisingly humanoid xenomorph emerging at the end of the film figure in all this?Whatever the ""Prometheus"" sequel holds in store, I hope Dr. Shaw and David encounter a space crew that has more in common with the discipline, philosophy, and mentality of ""Star Trek"" than that of ""Friday the 13th"".",3,"Lack of Professional (Star Trek) Discipline

Too bad the same cannot be said of the movie itself.  The movie is disappointing on many, many levels.Watching the making-of documentary, one really gets the sense of the tremendous amount of skill and care that went into the production design of this film.  It's a shame that the same skill and care was not put into the script or the character development.  It's like the right dress on the wrong girl.I did have problems playing the documentary, though.  I had to stop and restart it several times, and even unplug my Blu-ray player twice to clear the player's memory.  The disc would freeze in the middle of fast-forwarding, and it had great difficulty returning to the Top Menu of the bonus disc on command, if it responded at all.  The documentary is nearly 4 hours long so it is not practical to watch it in one sitting.  Sometimes it would offer to resume playback at the previous cut-off point, but more often than not I'd have to start from the beginning again and fast-forward and chapter search.  My Blu-ray player is only 4 years old.  I haven't had this issue with other discs.The movie itself was a beautiful-looking disaster.  It made me sad to watch it because of all the amateurishness in the script and dialogue.

Simply put, Ridley Scott shot a breathtakingly beautiful film; the Real3D is amazing and isn't poorly done like in some converted films. Every frame in this film is beautiful and, although limited, the computer-generated images are stunning. Also, the soundtrack matches the film, at least in my opinion. I thought it sounded epic as the crew made their discovery. The music from the trailers and the teasers isn't actually heard, or at least I don't remember hearing it.The acting was great from the whole cast; I didn't see any notable flaws in the acting. The actions of some characters were questionable though. Why would you move toward a snake-like species when you've seen so many unexplained dead bodies already? Aside from a couple of silly, or stupid, character choices, the actual story is amazing. The story is the search for the engineers that may have engineered us; the search for our creators. It builds a very creepy yet fascinating atmosphere filled with the mystery of life. There are many unanswered questions, but I think it was done purposely. It leaves the door open for the very-likely sequel. Regardless, I actually enjoyed the mystery.This is the best film I've seen all year and possibly last year as well. I don't recommend going into this film expecting a direct prequel to Alien, since it really isn't. It can really standalone.

Now we cut to a ship named Prometheus with a large crew, one of them not quite human who knows a lot about the ship and how the crew should take care of themselves.The crew arrives on a distant planet that seems capable of sustaining life, once they investigate they find giant stone faces and many things that seem to confirm that some form of life was here once. Well of course something is here and it begins to attack the crew person by person, so the rest of the film is the survivors trying to escape this planet and return home.Some of the crew have ulterior motives, mainly for profit (would this be a peaceful expedition if money wasn't a motive?) and quite frankly there's not a lot of people to root for. The cast includes Charlize Theron (""Monster""), Noomi Rapace (""Girl With The Dragon Tattoo""), Guy Pearce (""The Time Machine""), Idris Elba (""Obsessed"") and others, though no one really has a standout performance and just kinda go by the books.One thing I give major credit to is the visual effects and locations as they are both top notch, there is some good atmosphere and a little creepiness at times but at its core its mainly quite a dull and uninspired flick. This prequel reminds me a lot of prequel of ""The Thing"", in that it had some decent parts but mainly felt unnecessary. Scott is a great director but he has directed some duds (""G.I.

1475699,A3AVNX9RHHNSLD,B005LAIHXQ,Jorge A. Lacayo,"[15, 32]","The greatest strength - one of many - in ""Prometheus"" is that it is decidedly not another ""Alien"" movie. It's a film that exists entirely in its own framework, only borrowing elements from the series and hinting at things that would happen in other films.While ""Prometheus"" is clearly a prequel to the ""Alien"" franchise, I now understand why Ridley Scott has said multiple times that it's not a ""direct prequel"" to the series. It's not like last year's ""The Thing,"" which literally ends to lead into the opening shots of the 1982 classic. ""Prometheus"" sets the stage for ""Alien,"" yes, but it leaves plenty unexplained.So if you're expecting a retread of Ridley Scott's original monster movie in space, you'll be sorely disappointed. And that's why I think some reviews of the film are coming in so soft.But what were you really expecting? Even a quick glance over Ridley Scott's filmography shows that he doesn't tread the same ground twice. Even films like ""Gladiator"" and ""Kingdom of Heaven,"" which share a lot of themes and elements, are entirely different movies. Why would anyone expect ""Alien: The Prequel - The Tragic Journey of the Space Jockey""?At it's heart, ""Prometheus"" is a grand piece of speculative fiction, which opens some thought-provoking doors as to humanity, our beginnings, morality and immortality. It's the story of a scientific vessel traveling to a distant planet to discover our extraterrestrial ancestors. However, upon arrival, the crew finds some terrifying things and uncovers some unpleasant secrets about our origins.I won't say anything more than that, but rather will let the film sit for itself. Things in ""Prometheus"" need to be revealed by the film, not by trailers, marketing and spoilery reviews. Yes, there are bits and pieces you will recognize from the ""Alien"" universe, but it gives a very different view of that universe.Noomi Rapace holds her own as the lead of the film, playing a bit of a precursor to Ellen Ripley. Her character is tough, adorable and complex, and she can be both the victim and the hero. She is supported by a strong cast that includes Charlize Theron as the corporate bigwig driving the mission, Guy Pearce as the aging benefactor and Idris Elba as the overly cliched but still enjoyable pilot.Still, the star that outshines Rapace in this film is Michael Fassbender as David, they synthetic human keeping control of the ship. (Yes, there's gotta be one of those in every movie, it seems.) Fassbender has been impressive in both indie and mainstream films lately, and here's another feather in his cap. It's an understated role, but like any great character, there's as much in what he doesn't say and do as is in what he does.""Prometheus"" is best enjoyed is a relative vacuum from the franchise that left Scott's hands more than 30 years ago. It's good to be familiar with the films, but it's best to expect a grand space journey along the lines of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" with teeth and less psychedelic drugs. It is not quite what you'll expect, and it's a better film for it.",5,The Alien saga regains credibility through Ridley Scott's mastery.,1339286400,"06 10, 2012",2012,3047,"['greatest', 'strength', 'one', 'many', 'Prometheus', 'decidedly', 'not', 'Alien', 'movie', 'film', 'entirely', 'own', 'framework', 'only', 'borrowing', 'elements', 'series', 'hinting', 'things', 'would', 'happen', 'other', 'films.While', 'Prometheus', 'clearly', 'prequel', 'Alien', 'franchise', 'now', 'understand', 'why', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'said', 'multiple', 'times', 'not', 'direct', 'prequel', 'series', 'not', 'last', 'year', 'Thing', 'literally', 'lead', 'opening', 'shots', '1982', 'classic', 'Prometheus', 'stage', 'Alien', 'yes', 'plenty', 'unexplained.So', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'retread', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'original', 'monster', 'movie', 'space', ""'ll"", 'be', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'why', 'think', 'reviews', 'film', 'are', 'coming', 'so', 'soft.But', 'what', 'were', 'really', 'expecting', 'Even', 'quick', 'glance', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'filmography', ""n't"", 'tread', 'same', 'ground', 'twice', 'Even', 'films', 'Gladiator', 'Kingdom', 'Heaven', 'share', 'lot', 'themes', 'elements', 'are', 'entirely', 'different', 'movies', 'Why', 'would', 'anyone', 'expect', 'Alien', 'Prequel', 'Tragic', 'Journey', 'Space', 'Jockey', 'heart', 'Prometheus', 'grand', 'piece', 'speculative', 'fiction', 'thought-provoking', 'doors', 'humanity', 'beginnings', 'morality', 'immortality', 'story', 'scientific', 'vessel', 'traveling', 'distant', 'planet', 'discover', 'extraterrestrial', 'ancestors', 'However', 'arrival', 'crew', 'terrifying', 'things', 'uncovers', 'unpleasant', 'secrets', 'origins.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'anything', 'more', 'rather', 'will', 'let', 'film', 'sit', 'Things', 'Prometheus', 'need', 'be', 'revealed', 'film', 'not', 'trailers', 'marketing', 'spoilery', 'reviews', 'Yes', 'are', 'bits', 'pieces', 'will', 'recognize', 'Alien', 'universe', 'very', 'different', 'view', 'universe.Noomi', 'Rapace', 'own', 'lead', 'film', 'playing', 'bit', 'precursor', 'Ellen', 'Ripley', 'character', 'tough', 'adorable', 'complex', 'can', 'be', 'victim', 'hero', 'supported', 'strong', 'cast', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'corporate', 'bigwig', 'driving', 'mission', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'aging', 'benefactor', 'Idris', 'Elba', 'overly', 'cliched', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'pilot.Still', 'star', 'Rapace', 'film', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'David', 'synthetic', 'human', 'keeping', 'control', 'ship', 'Yes', 'got', 'ta', 'be', 'one', 'movie', 'Fassbender', 'been', 'impressive', 'indie', 'mainstream', 'films', 'lately', 'here', 'feather', 'cap', 'understated', 'role', 'great', 'character', 'as', 'much', 'what', ""n't"", 'say', 'do', 'as', 'what', 'Prometheus', 'best', 'enjoyed', 'relative', 'vacuum', 'franchise', 'left', 'Scott', 'hands', 'more', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'good', 'be', 'familiar', 'films', 'best', 'expect', 'grand', 'space', 'journey', 'lines', '2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', 'teeth', 'less', 'psychedelic', 'drugs', 'not', 'quite', 'what', ""'ll"", 'expect', 'better', 'film']",N/A

1475710,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B005LAIHXQ,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[8, 14]","Prometheus marks Ridley Scott's first science-fiction film since Blade Runner 30 years ago and returns to the universe of his seminal, 1979 masterpieceAlien. The question over whether or not this is actually a prequel to Alien (as was originally intended) has been thoroughly exhausted at this point and ultimately irrelevant. You need not have seen any other film to appreciate, admire, and enjoy Scott's latest sci-fi venture. Prometheus takes place in the same universe and references Scott's earlier film, but it really does function as a stand-alone film. With a budget somewhere between $120 and $130 million, there is little to separate Prometheus from a typical summer blockbuster. What ultimately does separate it is Ridley Scott, a man gifted in making big films with big ideas. There is enough action and visual effects to please the average moviegoer, but Prometheus is backed by an intelligent script that asks a lot of questions, answers few of them, and gives us something to ponder instead of just mindlessly blowing things up. Take that, Michael Bay.The hypnotic opening sequence (shot in Iceland) shows a humanoid alien standing above a waterfall, drinking a mysterious liquid that induces vomiting and rapid decay. This scene is ambiguous in that it gives us no information about where he is, what he is, and or what the implications of this moment are. It intrigues us for a moment, before the film jump cuts to the year 2089. Here, archaeologist Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) has discovered a star map among wall paintings from several unrelated cultures that she views as an invitation from the Engineers that may have created human life. Funded by Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce), the elderly CEO of Weyland Corporation, Shaw and a crew embark on a voyage to the distant moon LV-223 aboard the vessel Prometheus. Travelling in stasis and monitored by the android David (Michael Fassbender), they arrive in 2093 and embark on their mission to find their creators.Despite taking place in the same universe as Alien, the world created by the extravagant sets in Prometheus evoke a world all its own. The sets are intricately designed, large-scale creations; early contenders for the best set design Academy Award next year. Scott masterfully blends large sets, special effects, and good location scouting to create an atmospheric new world. If Prometheus offered nothing else by way of quality, it's an amazing film to look at.It recalls Alien most noticeably in that both have a strong female protagonist and both emphasize patient, slow-burning suspense, atmosphere, and an intelligent script that equally balances a complex narrative with beautifully integrated special effects. Prometheus does not jump directly in to the action. You'll be intrigued before you'll be amazed. In a genre that frequently allows acting prowess to take a backseat to hyperkinetic imagery, you'll find some fine performances here too.Fassbender, always the fascinating actor, wonderfully captures the ambiguous emotions of his android character. His performance is sophisticated, robotic, and yet layered with depth. It's as if HAL-9000 had assumed the look of T.S. Lawrence and was allowed to freely wander the ship. It's a performance that hurtles him ever-closer to the A-list. Rapace makes a strong, sensitive substitute for Sigourney Weaver and Charlize Theron sternly embodies a character that metaphorically holds the entire narrative subtext together.Prometheus is imperfect, but these flaws are few and far between. Sure, fanboys may find fault with how it works chronologically with Alien (despite the fact that it's not a prequel officially), but my issues come from two much different aspects. One is Guy Pearce's makeup. When compared to the seamless visual effects, his makeup seems unconvincing and overdone. Granted, I didn't initially recognize Pearce, but I also didn't believe that Peter Weyland was an elderly man. Another issue comes from something I've already praised; the script. As intelligent and thought-provoking as it is, it doesn't offer anything new by way of story structure. It follows the template seen in Alien and more recently in Sunshine (as well as, I assume, several movies in-between). It just follows too many cues that the seasoned moviegoer will recognize right away (establish reason for mission, upon arrival there's a change in the mission, the characters begin exploring, ominous things happen, characters get scared and die unbeknownst to the others, etc.). Sure, writers Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof have fashioned something spectacular, but it wouldn't hurt to break from the template and create something wholly new.Minor issues aside, it's terrific summer entertainment and a roaring return for Ridley Scott to the genre in which he made his name. Prometheus is a terrific film and one of the better high-minded science-fiction films to emerge from Hollywood in several years. It has suspense, horror, intelligence, drama, and depth typically eschewed in favor of a special effects extravaganza during Hollywood blockbuster season.",4,A Fine Science Fiction Film,1344729600,"08

An alien snakelike creature pops up from a puddle of goo, and presumed scientists taunt and play with it like it is harmless, which of course it isn't. In one instance an infected crew member is killed rather than be allowed back on board, while later another member who has reappeared after vanishing has  the door opened for him without question -- and with negative consequences for everyone else.

The movie does however garner a lot of nerd-rage from those expecting more from it. The problem with Prometheus is it's a big dumb movie masquerading as a thoughtful, intelligent film about the origins of our existence and the questions such as ""What is our place in universe?"" Personally, it makes it hard for me to give a crap about these existential questionings when I'm given cardboard characters straight out of any generic slasher film except instead of teens they're scientists who are all well out of their teens, which makes their stupid decision all the more clich&eacute;d. These supposedly intelligent and experienced scientists go around making all the basic horror movie mistakes. They're all easily broken down as, the hothead, the goofy sidekick with glasses, the b*tch (who never quite lives up to her title yet the script seems to think she does), the jerk boyfriend, the nice (boring) girlfriend and the cool guy (the pilot). The only exceptions are David, the android, who clearly has emotions yet chooses (understandably so) to hide this from his shipmates and the other 10 crewmembers who have no purpose other than to be killed off. This lack of character means you have no horse in this race.The next problem is the fact that this movie has no idea what it wants to be, a generic monster/horror film or an intelligent sci-fi delving into questions of the origin of human life and the meaning of having a soul.

Hazarding a guess, I would imagine it began with a stupid script, and then Ridley Scott hired LOST alumnus Damon Lindelof to shroud everything in mystery so you could not tell how stupid it all was.  If you choose to have faith that, in the end, it will somehow all hold together, then you will be invited to buy the DVD or BluRay in the hopes that 20-30 minutes of extended footage will throw some small light on a thousand unanswered questions.  If you are still in the dark (as you surely will be), then you will be invited to further deepen your confusion by viewing the next episode of this unfinished story, due to be released a year or two from now.The setup:  Peter Weyland (aged billionaire) buys into Von-Daniken-style theories that life on Earth was created and nurtured by alien ""gods"", so he sends the starship PROMETHEUS to find them.  The crew of 17 includes Janek (captain), Chance and Ravel (pilots), Shaw (idiot archaeologist partially to blame for Weyland's dumb theories), Holloway (Shaw's idiot boyfriend), Vickers (inscrutable ice princess), Millburn (idiot biologist), Fifield (idiot geologist), Ford (woman with Scottish accent) and about 8 nameless, faceless nobodies.  Also on board is ""David"" (inscrutable android).After 2 years in hypersleep and a 35+ light-year journey in the general direction indicated by ancient cave art, these assorted idiots arrive in a distant star system, choose a convenient moon of a convenient gas giant, and, after flying over the surface for a minute or two, land in an almost-random location after noticing some straight lines in the earth.  By luck, it turns out they have landed right next a giant alien pyramid.  They start exploring, and, as you would expect in an Alien prequel, soon start dying horribly.  Despite some assorted mayhem, this film does not work as horror, mainly because the viewer does not give a rat's whisker about any of the people getting killed.  Most victims are completely unlikeable and/or seem to lack any instincts for self-preservation.  If they don't care whether they live or die, then why should we?  Meanwhile, suspension of disbelief is constantly being shattered by the general idiocy of the script.Don't expect to know what is going on.  While the visuals, events and atmosphere are vaguely similar to the sort you would expect from an Alien movie, the creatures we encounter are not the same, and their precise connection to the creatures we know will remain obscure - adding to the dozens of unanswered questions you will be left with at the film's end.  The failure to tie in directly with ALIEN would be fine if it managed to tell its own story, but it doesn't.Meanwhile, the film-makers try to impress you by asking ""big questions"" about God, creation, what is the essential difference, if any, between a robot and a human being, whether creating ""life"" makes you a ""god"", etc., etc.  If you have any sense, you will notice that it takes no intelligence to merely ASK such questions, and that the film fails to offer any answers or even meaningful insights concerning them.",1,Drowning in a Sea of Phony Mystery,1339459200,"06 12, 2012",2012,3162,"['Prometheus', 'quasi-prequel', 'Alien', 'pretty', 'sense', 'whatsoever', 'Hazarding', 'guess', 'would', 'imagine', 'began', 'stupid', 'script', 'then', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'hired', 'LOST', 'alumnus', 'Damon', 'Lindelof', 'shroud', 'everything', 'mystery', 'could', 'not', 'tell', 'how', 'stupid', 'was', 'choose', 'have', 'faith', 'end', 'will', 'somehow', 'hold', 'together', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'invited', 'buy', 'DVD', 'BluRay', 'hopes', '20-30', 'minutes', 'extended', 'footage', 'will', 'throw', 'small', 'light', 'thousand', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'are', 'still', 'dark', 'surely', 'will', 'be', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'invited', 'further', 'deepen', 'confusion', 'viewing', 'next', 'episode', 'unfinished', 'story', 'due', 'be', 'released', 'year', 'two', 'now.The', 'setup', 'Peter', 'Weyland', 'aged', 'billionaire', 'Von-Daniken-style', 'theories', 'life', 'Earth', 'was', 'created', 'nurtured', 'alien', 'gods', 'starship', 'PROMETHEUS', 'find', 'crew', '17', 'Janek', 'captain', 'Chance', 'Ravel', 'pilots', 'Shaw', 'idiot', 'archaeologist', 'partially', 'blame', 'Weyland', 'dumb', 'theories', 'Holloway', 'Shaw', 'idiot', 'boyfriend', 'Vickers', 'inscrutable', 'ice', 'princess', 'Millburn', 'idiot', 'biologist', 'Fifield', 'idiot', 'geologist', 'Ford', 'woman', 'Scottish', 'accent', '8', 'nameless', 'faceless', 'nobodies', 'Also', 'board', 'David', 'inscrutable', 'android', '2', 'years', 'hypersleep', '35+', 'light-year', 'journey', 'general', 'direction', 'indicated', 'ancient', 'cave', 'art', 'assorted', 'idiots', 'arrive', 'distant', 'star', 'system', 'choose', 'convenient', 'moon', 'convenient', 'gas', 'giant', 'flying', 'surface', 'minute', 'two', 'land', 'almost-random', 'location', 'noticing', 'straight', 'lines', 'earth', 'luck', 'out', 'have', 'landed', 'right', 'giant', 'alien', 'pyramid', 'start', 'exploring', 'would', 'expect', 'Alien', 'prequel', 'soon', 'start', 'dying', 'horribly', 'assorted', 'mayhem', 'film', 'not', 'work', 'horror', 'mainly', 'viewer', 'not', 'give', 'rat', 'whisker', 'people', 'getting', 'killed', 'Most', 'victims', 'are', 'completely', 'unlikeable', 'and/or', 'seem', 'lack', 'instincts', 'self-preservation', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'live', 'die', 'then', 'why', 'should', 'Meanwhile', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'constantly', 'being', 'shattered', 'general', 'idiocy', 'script.Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'visuals', 'events', 'are', 'vaguely', 'similar', 'sort', 'would', 'expect', 'Alien', 'movie', 'creatures', 'encounter', 'are', 'not', 'same', 'precise', 'connection', 'creatures', 'know', 'will', 'remain', 'obscure', 'adding', 'dozens', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'will', 'be', 'left', 'film', 'end', 'failure', 'tie', 'directly', 'ALIEN', 'would', 'be', 'fine', 'managed', 'tell', 'own', 'story', ""doesn't.Meanwhile"", 'film-makers', 'try', 'impress', 'asking', 'big', 'questions', 'God', 'creation', 'what', 'essential', 'difference', 'robot', 'human', 'being', 'creating', 'life', 'god', 'etc.', 'etc', 'have', 'sense', 'will', 'notice', 'intelligence', 'merely', 'ASK', 'such', 'questions', 'film', 'offer', 'answers', 'even', 'meaningful', 'insights', 'concerning']",N/A

Although ""Alien"" was essentially a horror movie in space, it adhered to the ""Star Wars"" philosophy of a ""used"" universe where everything is functional, it looks used and lived in as a deep space voyage would be. ""Alien"" also spawned several sequels (to varying degrees of success) and now ""Alien"" follows ""Star Wars"" into the land of prequels.""Prometheus"" starts in the year 2089 when a pair of archeologists, Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) discover the oldest cave paintings that depict giant aliens pointing to a star system they couldn't possibly have known about. The next thing we know the archeologists and team of scientists are off on a mission, paid for by the ultimately corrupt Weyland Corporation, to the mystery planet which turns out to be LV-426, here named LV-23. Although the planet isn't as inhospitable as it is in ""Alien"", they quickly discover a series of pyramids and set off to explore the nearest one (rather impetuously). They quickly discover alien  holograms that lead them to the fossilized remains of the alien seen in the spaceship in ""Alien"" and discover a room full of canisters and the statue of a head with very human like features. David (Michael Fassbinder), an android, soon demonstrates a propensity for carrying a secret agenda different from the stated goals of the mission In space you shouldn`t trust an android.One of the mistakes sequels and prequels make is to try and remake the original movie by recycling scenes from the original and giving them a slightly different context. While ""Prometheus"" gives its fair share of nods and homage to ""Alien"" they're reimagined in ""Prometheus"" and the ""Alien"" reference or scene isn't dependent or redolent of ""Alien.""There have been numerous comparisons between ""Prometheus"" and ""2001"" and parallels certainly exist. The most obvious is the introductory ""creation"" scene of life on earth which is the rough equivalent to the monolith in ""2001"" spurring the explosion of intelligence in the hominids. Michael Fassbinder as David is the HAL of the movie with a little Jude Law from ""A.I."" and Michael Rennie from ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" and perhaps a little David Bowie (although Peter O'Toole in ""Lawrence of Arabia"" is referenced). The plots of ""Prometheus"" and ""2001"" are similar. The search for a higher intelligence, God, that created us and the search for answers although ""Prometheus"" is a film for the 21st century and has a darker vision of the future than the forward looking ""2001"" of the late 60's and 20th century did. There's even a scene towards the end that could qualify as the psychedelic scene at the end of ""2001"". Or is Guy Pearce as a corrupt industrialist doing an homage to Keir Dullea as the old man at the end of ""2001""?Director Ridley Scott (""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner"" among others) gives us a movie with lush visuals and a panoramic scope (which I guess made for great viewing of the movie in 3-D), and the acting he gets from the cast is top notch. A special nod should be given to Charlize Theron as the ice queen commander of the ship, but she manages to interject a bit of humanity into the role and doesn't deserve the end she meets in the movie.While there are some plot holes in the film and some that are instantly obvious, ignore them, there's more going on in this movie that holds your attention and as the story moves along. We become intrigued as to the origin and intentions of the giant aliens that drew the humans to the planet, as the ""Alien"" creature evolves, moving us and the story closer to the ""Alien"" we all know and enjoy.It's a rare movie that I didn't want to see end and when it did end I wanted to see more.",5,A 2001 for the 21st Century,1339804800,"06 16, 2012",2012,3775,"['1979', 'Alien', 'was', 'part', 'science', 'fiction', 'boom', 'created', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Alien', 'was', 'essentially', 'horror', 'movie', 'space', 'adhered', 'Star', 'Wars', 'philosophy', 'used', 'universe', 'where', 'everything', 'functional', 'used', 'lived', 'deep', 'space', 'voyage', 'would', 'be', 'Alien', 'also', 'spawned', 'several', 'sequels', 'varying', 'degrees', 'success', 'now', 'Alien', 'Star', 'Wars', 'land', 'prequels', 'Prometheus', 'year', '2089', 'when', 'pair', 'archeologists', 'Elizabeth', 'Shaw', 'Noomi', 'Rapace', 'Charlie', 'Holloway', 'Logan', 'Marshall-Green', 'oldest', 'cave', 'paintings', 'depict', 'giant', 'aliens', 'pointing', 'star', 'system', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'have', 'known', 'about', 'next', 'thing', 'know', 'archeologists', 'team', 'scientists', 'are', 'off', 'mission', 'paid', 'ultimately', 'corrupt', 'Weyland', 'Corporation', 'mystery', 'planet', 'out', 'be', 'LV-426', 'here', 'named', 'LV-23', 'planet', ""n't"", 'as', 'inhospitable', 'Alien', 'quickly', 'discover', 'series', 'pyramids', 'set', 'off', 'explore', 'nearest', 'one', 'rather', 'impetuously', 'quickly', 'discover', 'alien', 'holograms', 'lead', 'fossilized', 'remains', 'alien', 'seen', 'spaceship', 'Alien', 'discover', 'room', 'full', 'canisters', 'statue', 'head', 'very', 'human', 'features', 'David', 'Michael', 'Fassbinder', 'android', 'soon', 'propensity', 'carrying', 'secret', 'agenda', 'different', 'stated', 'goals', 'mission', 'space', 'shouldn', 't', 'trust', 'android.One', 'mistakes', 'sequels', 'prequels', 'make', 'try', 'remake', 'original', 'movie', 'recycling', 'scenes', 'original', 'giving', 'slightly', 'different', 'context', 'Prometheus', 'fair', 'share', 'nods', 'homage', 'Alien', ""'re"", 'reimagined', 'Prometheus', 'Alien', 'reference', 'scene', ""n't"", 'dependent', 'redolent', 'Alien', 'have', 'been', 'numerous', 'comparisons', 'Prometheus', '2001', 'certainly', 'exist', 'most', 'obvious', 'introductory', 'creation', 'scene', 'life', 'earth', 'rough', 'equivalent', 'monolith', '2001', 'spurring', 'explosion', 'intelligence', 'hominids', 'Michael', 'Fassbinder', 'David', 'HAL', 'movie', 'little', 'Jude', 'Law', 'A.I', 'Michael', 'Rennie', 'Day', 'Earth', 'Stood', 'Still', 'perhaps', 'little', 'David', 'Bowie', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'referenced', 'plots', 'Prometheus', '2001', 'are', 'similar', 'search', 'higher', 'intelligence', 'God', 'created', 'search', 'answers', 'Prometheus', 'film', '21st', 'century', 'darker', 'vision', 'future', 'forward', 'looking', '2001', 'late', '60', '20th', 'century', 'did', 'even', 'scene', 'end', 'could', 'qualify', 'psychedelic', 'scene', 'end', '2001', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'corrupt', 'industrialist', 'doing', 'homage', 'Keir', 'Dullea', 'old', 'man', 'end', '2001', 'Director', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'Alien', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'others', 'movie', 'lush', 'visuals', 'panoramic', 'scope', 'guess', 'made', 'great', 'viewing', 'movie', '3-D', 'acting', 'cast', 'top', 'notch', 'special', 'nod', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'ice', 'queen', 'commander', 'ship', 'interject', 'bit', 'humanity', 'role', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'end', 'movie.While', 'are', 'plot', 'holes', 'film', 'are', 'instantly', 'obvious', 'ignore', 'more', 'going', 'movie', 'attention', 'story', 'moves', 'along', 'become', 'intrigued', 'origin', 'intentions', 'giant', 'aliens', 'drew', 'humans', 'planet', 'Alien', 'creature', 'moving', 'story', 'closer', 'Alien', 'know', 'enjoy.It', 'rare', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'end', 'when', 'did', 'end', 'wanted', 'see', 'more']",N/A
1475737,AJNW2SVETWAW1,B005LAIHXQ,kacunnin,"[8, 26]","Ridley Scott's PROMETHEUS is a mushy mix-up of science fiction, horror, and new-age spirituality.  The film, set in the year 2093 (29 years before the action in the 1979 film ALIEN takes place), suggests that alien humanoid beings ""seeded"" the earth with their own DNA (or a combination of their own DNA and manufactured DNA) in order to create intelligent life.  These alien humanoid beings are the ""space jockeys"" first seen in the 1979 film - they are the pilots of the derelict space ship Ripley and her crew discover on the surface of LV-426.  As Dr. Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) concludes in PROMETHEUS, they are the ""engineers"" of humanity, or the architects of our intelligent design.This all sounds very deep and complex and earth-shattering, and it could have been.  But it isn't.  Because very little is actually revealed about the ""space jockeys,"" their purpose in the universe, or their ultimate connection to life as we know it.  This is a story created backwards.  Scott and his cohorts (including LOST's Damon Lindelof) are doing the ""reboot"" thing in PROMETHEUS.  They take the known Alien universe and re-engineer it to set up a new legion of films.  These won't be films about Aliens . . . or even about space.  These are films about creationism.  Who is our father, this film asks.  Who created us?  And why do we ultimately want to destroy our creator, just as our creator wants to destroy us?Basically, PROMETHEUS is about a team of scientists on a corporate-sponsored mission to discover the origins of humanity.  They follow star charts discovered in ancient cave drawings to a planetoid (or moon) light years away, on which they find the remains of a humanoid outpost - the ""space jockeys"" of ALIEN fame.  Once they get there, they behave in very unscientific fashion, making every mistake in the book (why, oh why didn't they watch a few sci-fi movies before venturing into that freaky bunker?).  Again, there are cool visuals . . . and a few heart-jumping action scenes.  Bad things happen and a lot of people die.  But it all feels very formulaic, very reminiscent of the other movies, almost as if it was put together from a targeted list (infected crewmember wants back onto the ship, check!; creepy worm thing plunges down someone's throat, check!; someone is ""impregnated,"" check!; someone else is chest-busted, check!; water drips everywhere, check!).And not one character is particularly likable or memorable or interesting in any way.  Corporate hack Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron) is a cool icy blond with little to do in the film but walk around and act like she owns the ship (which I guess she does) - she is part of neither the action nor the spiritual heart of the film.  She's just there, and she's dull as dirt.  Shaw (Rapace) is supposed to be the Ripley character, the strong, resourceful woman with the guts to survive.  But she's weepy and silly, making bad decision after bad decision - the worst of which is to get too close to equally silly boyfriend Dr. Charley Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green).  Robot David (Michael Fassbender) is what we expect a robot to be - he alternates between sounding like Hal from 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY and Data from STNG.  We know what robots are like in these films - they're either evil corporate stooges (like Ash in ALIEN) or friendly protectors of humanity (like Bishop in ALIENS).  David is more like Data, I guess - he is intrigued by humanity and by his connection to his creator, corporate honcho Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce, in a horrific old-guy suit).  I guess you could say that David is the most interesting character in the film . . . but that's not saying all that much.  He brings little to the franchise that hasn't already been seen a hundred times.The problem is, Lindelof is doing his ""Lost thing"" here.  He throws out just enough intriguing stuff to get his viewers scratching their heads.  What planet do we really see in the opening scenes of the film?  There's a gorgeous waterfall and breathtaking vistas.  There's a cool saucer-shaped ship, and something really strange and portentous happens.  Is it Earth?  Is it?  And what planet (or moon or planetoid) do our intrepid band of scientists visit?  Is it the same planet on which ALIEN and ALIENS take place?  Or some other planet in the same system?  So does that mean two ""space jockey"" ships crash land in exactly the same way on two different planets?  And what's the black goo all about, and those tiny worms, and the octopus thing?  And why does the technology in 2093 seem light years ahead of the technology in 2122?  Ask all you like, because there are no answers here.  There are ""suggestions,"" of course.  And you can make of them whatever you like.  It's the easiest kind of screenplay to write - don't worry about it all making sense; the viewers will fill in the blanks for you!Ultimately, PROMETHEUS is a watchable mess, a conglomeration of stuff that could, in less fractured hands, have come together into a truly great film.  As it is, Scott bows to Lindelof and we get little more than a watchable mess.  It's a gorgeous film, and it's worth seeing.  But it makes little sense.  Wait . . . the sequels will clear everything up for us!  Sure, Mr. Lindelof.  That's what you said about LOST.",2,"PROMETHEUS is a watchable mess -- it makes little sense, but it looks good",1339372800,"06 11, 2012",2012,5267,"['Ridley', 'Scott', 'PROMETHEUS', 'mushy',

When I commented on the original Alien I said that the reaction of those in the theater was spectacular and we all realized that we had just witnessed  a very special film.  My opinion is that Ridley Scott has equaled or exceeded his origin Alien vision.I have also kept up with the franchise over the years by seeing all the Alien spinooffs (like the Alien vs Preditor series which I didn't like too much). Prometheus on DVD viewed very well on my 52"" HDTV and watching this new movie was as unique an experience as watching the original Alien and I viewed it three times serially! Now that I have seen it I know I would like to see it again on Blu-Ray for the slightly superior screen quality and the information contained on the total of four disks.Again it did not dissapoint except for being left open for a sequel.  I have seen the various chat sites at which dedicated Alien fans have left their opinions and suggested some plots for a possible Prometheus 2 after the gears of our legal system grind out to their conclusion.I hope the great Ridley Scott or as talented a director  can make it.

I am a great fan of really good scifi...this is not it. I own all the major dvds on the major Alien franchise...personally saw ALIENS two times at my theater...when the BIG SCREEN meant that; not those over sized projection screens we are all now subjected to. Those were all awesome films...personally the first two Alien and Aliens kicked, the last two were mediocre at best but workable and had a story line. (also loved Gladiator and own that too; Sir Ridley Scott shined). I am personally surprised this film ever received above a one star rating by any objective critic. It SUCKED..sorry for the venacular.DON'T READ BEYOND THIS SINCE IT INVOLVES SPOILERS....OR LACK OF THEM.  This story starts with the alleged human god or human ancestor with a spaceship coming down, perhaps after him and then basically he takes some suicide drink, falls off the cliff into water and is dissolved, with DNA strands disbanding in the water he fell into and the spaceship leaves...no explanation what any of that meant..(even later we don't know ever)...Later in the film we discover this weird DNA match to these massive humans or this particular human is brought up to show our possible lineage to them (i am guessing but nothing is every later confirmed anyway). Later this human/ancestor wants to go to earth to destroy earth. (Ending of the film is the other heroes and captain of the expeditions ship destroys the first ship ((the one containing the human/ancestor giant now fighting a large squid type alien)) and inbetween all that are good actors with no script to work with and having multiple different FRAGMENTS of individual stories that in the end never become cohesive. No one can like or have any personal bond to any of the characters because there are too many, plastic, one dimensional characters and too many individual elements that never largely meet anywhere. But on with the story beginning,our expedition ship arrives. No Aliens actually transpire (except the one the ancestor/human fights at the end of picture) but the story alludes (sort of) that these vases found in the caves they explored were aka alien pods. (Yes they went many times to caves and opened up several doors and saw holographs of our alleged alien/ancestors running around the caves and which we chased after them...again nothing is resolved for sure with that or ""explained"" ). Two crew members who chose to leave early run into some snake like creature and begin to tease/annoy it...(strange behavior for anyone, escpecially scientists to teast an unknown alien life form not knowing what it's capable of). These were the same bozos who just earlier became frightened of the holographs and chose to leave the cave expedition party to head back to the home ship.  But now later seeing this snake creature, they almost annoy and aggitate it...to their demise. (ONlY Hollyweird can write such inconsistent BS). Later it is suggested or inferred that this anomoly/area was a product of the military (aliens for biotech warfare is alluded to) and a greedy company to make money who have no moral compass helped in the construction of something...again they constructed what??? We never are told! (geeze does this sound new??) But they sent this party to this rock/planet anyway. David the robot/cyborg is evil then turns kind of good but job is to protects his architect who is this old man who funded this operation. He appeared as a holograph at the beginning of the film and was to be dead long before the crew arrived on this rock/planet and before the major crew was defreezed for the expedition...but lo and behold he is alive (towards the end of the film) and with all the greedy company (motives) and military weapon testing (motives to create something and not sure what???) alluded to throughout the film, the first story line now changes completely and it was REALLY about the old guy (the one funding the expedition)who was looking to avoid death...His fountain of youth he was hoping would be found in the alien ship...Of course that never happened and he and the robot/cyborg David are killed...(well David the robot is decapitated but alive and can speak....geeezze now isn't this new) and the alleged heroine (who got impregnaged by her briefly exposed boyfriend to an ""alien"" microbe)had this weird thing removed from her stomach...that later (towards end of filme)grew and killed the alleged ancestor/father to the human race who also wanted to destory earth(and we still don't know why). Now he (David the robot/cyborg missing his body from his head wants to help her (the heroine of our story...sort of) after she successfully runs from the ship and the evil human god/ancestor now fighting an alleged alien that came from her stomach that grew. This alleged protype alien that looks like a squid (truly national geo has a more frightening large squid photoed than this) and kills this alleged human ancestor/god with some weird tongue going down our alleged ancestor/alien throat that gives birth to a chest explosion with a brief 3 sec view of some creature coming out of the human/ancestor's chest. Now David the now NICE robot/cyborg will take her (our heroine) elsehwere to find the answers to all of this....THE END......I truly wish I were joking but that is it (largely) in a nutshell...I DEMAND my whopping $5 I paid for watching on ""demand"" tv.  Horrible, horrible film and yes Sir Ridley Scott should bow his head in shame to have his name associated with this monstrosity. (as far as these 5 or 4 points stars given; my ONLY explanation is they didn't WATCH the film or they are friends or relatives to the performers, director with a personal issue to hold).OK now for the good points:  (crickets..the sound of silence hmmmmmmmmmmm)  Ok Ridley Scotts name; good actors (with a limited script); hype and good special effects...truly THE END!

1475772,A2BDJOIXPR2AYU,B005LAIHXQ,King of Controversy,"[0, 0]","Aliens sure have some amazing DNA. When the movie begins an alien, outside a giant spaceship, ingests some squirmy material filling up a small tin. Immediately he begins to dissolve - falling into a waterway where he completely disintegrates. This is intended to show the origins, if not of all life on Earth, then the origins of man. This image is closer to something out of the book of Revelations than science that I know. Later in the film, one of the Aliens loses a fight to the death with another (seemingly primitive) blob-like alien, and his dead body is impregnated by it's larva or eggs. When the youngling hatches out of the Aliens body it is a small, boy-sized Alien of the type from the first four movies. The films have come full circle. We've now seen the origin of the 'Aliens'. During the film it's revealed that the humanoid Aliens have DNA that is a match for humans. But somehow it's more amazing. OK. All part of the amazing, and frightening power of DNA. This should also mean aliens are part human.The 'human aliens', by their appearance look a little bit like cartoons and not realistic like the 'Predator' aliens from earlier movies, or even the Aliens of the earlier films. The space ships and visuals look nice (aside from the human aliens); the film has some amazing footage. Then there are terrible scenes such as one showing a dimly lit room with menacing looking canisters that the film cuts back to over and over. The space ships look nice, and then one of their moon buggies, or land rovers they could be called, looks half out of a scene from Mad Max. I was giving the film the benefit of the doubt, thinking the bland and drab scenes (and dumb scenes) were included to make the scenes following them look that much more impressive, and that they are. Prometheus is an impressive film, with just too many 'flaws' to ignore.There's a great, funny, scene in the movie, where two scientists (stranded in an alien cave or building) are notified that there are alien life forms near; near, but not moving, and they say, 'we're going in the opposite direction', 'the decorations on the walls look like something out of the holocaust', one says. Then later, these same two discover an alien life-form and play with it like a pet until it kills them. Very Dumb. This change-up adds up to a big let-down for the viewer. You know we're trying to take this film seriously.To it's credit, this film embraces the earlier Alien vs Predator film (I liked that film). At least it embraces the aliens vs aliens while humans pass by theme. It also seems similar to that film in that much of it also takes place in a strange, foreign, cramped space. Something about Prometheus also reminds me of the film Event Horizon (which I liked too).What this film does well is explain it's plot, or the larger meanings to the actions, without in any way simply telling us. The robot mentions, ""this is a cargo bay""  (and we have to assume the robot knows more than anyone) and by hearing the captain of the Prometheus say things like, ""This is a military installation"", and a bit, perhaps, by intuition, we learn that this group of human aliens were intending to return to Earth to destroy us, and they were killed by other aliens. When the only surviving human alien is revived, he escapes, intending to piloting his ship to Earth to complete his mission. Why the human alien's civilization hasn't bothered to investigate the silence coming from this military installation (has it been days or thousands of years?) or even independently completed this mission, is a good question.What this film also does well is portray the robot accompanying the crew. So many of these Sci Fi movies have had these robot characters or automated intelligence's and this may have been the best one yet. The intelligence the AI seems to have, combined with his humor at the troubles of humans really is done effectively. Alas, near the end of the film, when the AI has a conversation with the human-alien the crew have awoken, it immediately walks up to him and then tears his head off. The lone human survivor of the film rescues his head, and then these two make-off for a new adventure at the end. To me, for a tiny moment when these two were together, it is almost sexual. Perhaps more humor than sex. And that could be because I've seen a scene like this before, one where a young Sci Fi fan, and his girlfriend, who is now just a face on a board, more or less, are the fitting survivors of a parody episode of Dr. Who. It was an incredible episode. If a small half-moment in this film was influenced, or a nod to this Dr. Who episode, I don't know. Maybe it's just me. The Sci Fi film 'Jason X' had a 'similar' love affair between a spaceman and a female robot - a robot who also loses her head. The be-smitten man carries it around for the rest of Jason X. He presumably intends to give her a new body. I liked Jason X too.Most of the reviews that I'd previously skimmed, suggested that the aliens want to kill us mostly because they can. The AI (and remember he is really smart) suggests instead that the aliens created us (the same reason we created him) because they can. This movie suggest the aliens want to kill us because they are afraid of us. If this idea is obvious, or if this may be an idea that may be being picked up 'unconsciously' by the viewer, let me know. . .  The movie suggests more than once that the young desire to kill the old. In one scene a character says, ""doesn't everyone want to kill their parents""? The captain of the ship tells her aging father, ""Just die"". There was quite an emphasis on this. Explaining, in my estimation, why the aliens would be afraid of us and want to kill us. If this is true, if people have a secret desire to see their parents die, I have no idea. If presenting such an idea is intended to increase support for say, the space program, it would seem just as likely a viewer would want to never see us enter space at all after seeing this film (but of course continue to expand our technology). One wouldn't think such a complex connection or inference would be picked up by our 'unconscious' mind but perhaps they've discovered our unconscious mind is more intelligent than our conscious mind. It may be. That they might be afraid of us (or afraid of us at some future time) is an old idea for me, the old Sci Fi reader that I am. The short story I read long ago, 'first contact', might have been where the idea came to me. I don't know.The ship's captain was my favorite (of the human characters) but it turns out she's a villain of sorts in the film. The actual (human) hero is really, really, impressive. I wonder if her body is done in part by some kind of 'CGI affects'. To tell the truth, I was thinking about this lady's image and 'type' a while after this film was over. This might be a good time to write another paragraph or two exploring the AI in the film, but, I'm out.A reviewer on a racist website denounced this movie saying, the white people are all portrayed as bad guys and the people of color all sacrifice themselves to save humanity. These are often the same people who always say that 'Hollywood' produces nothing but sin and anti-white racism. If this is true, having the (normal) roles reversed, shouldn't Prometheus be like mana from heaven for them?. I might have posted such a comment to the 'racist' review but I've only just seen the movie. That's not to say they may not have a point of some kind, or another kind of point, rather. Or some kind of point. It's complex issue. And what about those who have disdain for the racists, those who have a normal view, or even those who have a view that Hollywood is a racist (of the normal kind) hotbed, and that the entertainment industry has been nothing but disparaging to women and people of color (there was even a college lecture series by that name a couple of decades ago titled 'women, minorities and the media')? Someone claiming that Hollywood has been unfair to white women and men of color. . . ? Well, we needn't listen to anything else they would say for the rest of their lives.",3,The white people are bad guys. . the people of color all sacrifice themselves to save Earth.,1400803200,"05 23,

1475774,A26IONLR1YZ0U5,B005LAIHXQ,K. Jones,"[4, 7]","Yes, this is full of spoilers, but really the movie is so bad that it doesn't matter...I just wasted two hours of my life.  Let me preface this by saying that I am a huge sic-fi fan.  I loved Alien.  Blade Runner is one of my favorite movies.  But this movie just didn't make any sense at all.  None of the characters were developed.  About half of the crew only appeared on the screen to die.  The ""science"" didn't make any sense.  The actions of the characters didn't make any sense.Questions: Why would the biologist run away from dead bodies and then try to play with an aggressive alien ""snake"" thing?  How could the ""engineer"" DNA match human DNA even though they look totally different?  How could a geologist who just mapped the entire cave system with his probe ""pups"" become lost?  Why would the head of the corporation hide on the ship instead of just being honest about it?  Why does no one seem to care to ask why a woman (who just gave herself an emergency C-section) is running around the ship in her underwear covered in blood?  What happened to the characters who tried to subdue Shaw (I'm pretty sure she didn't kill them, but they never seemed to appear again)?  And, for goodness sake, why don't they run sideways when the ship is rolling towards them?  Oh, there are so many more questions!Since this is pretending to be a prequel, let me trace how we get to the xenomorph that we're more familiar with from the Alien franchise:1.  In the beginning of the film one of the ""engineers"" swallows a bunch of black dots which then completely destroy his DNA and cause him to disintegrate.2.  Android puts a single one of these black dots into the drink of a human so human becomes infected with DNA destroying substance.3.  An hour later, infected human has sex with another human and she becomes ""pregnant"" with...something.4.  Infected man is burned to death, but then reawakens as a transformed maniac zombie that proceeds to kill everything in sight for no reason.  This is never explained.5.  After 10 hours, pregnant woman gives herself a C-section and some sort of alien is pulled out.  (But it's not THE alien!)6.  After another day, this alien manages to grow into a 10 ft long tentacled beast.7.  The alien beast then infects an ""engineer"" (who is also a maniac killer for reasons unbeknownst to me) by jamming a tentacle down his throat and enveloping him.8.  An unspecified amount of time later, the engineer's chest bursts open and something crawls out.  Now, finally, we have the xenomorph!  And then the movie ends.Summary: Black dot > human > sexual transmission to another human > alien > engineer > xenomorph.And this makes sense, how?  And don't tell me it all makes sense because there are some fracking Easter eggs or that the storytelling is so deep that it's beyond my comprehension.  Rubbish!Oh, and if you knew an alien race was building up an arsenal and planning to come to Earth to destroy all humans, and you meet one of these aliens and he immediately tries to kill you, would you then decide to go to their planet to ASK THEM WHY?

And I am an AVID scifi fan as well as a HUGE supporter of remake/sequel/prequel modernizing of predetermined storylines. There was alot that couldn't be done in the originals of almost ALL the epic and genre setting scifi films, which took away alot from the experience. Such films as the Star Wars Saga, the Aliens Quadrilogy (which is also associated and tied into the Predator franchise and storyline now), the Terminator Story Arc and just about anything else that was mind blowing 22 years ago or more is now just a joke compared to modern film. Characterization in scifi genre'd films is richer and more colorful now, not to mention the visualizations and music scores almost acting as main characters to the films themselves. You will never find ANYONE who supports modernizing a project more than me!!!With that said, this film couldn't have been any further off the mark. Charlize Theron phoned it in (or I hope so, because she was worse in this than she was in ""The Astronaut's Wife). The accent of Noomi Rapace was so thick, I couldn't understand 90% of what she was saying. Scott tried WAY TOO HARD to wedge this story to fit one or two stories away from the original Alien, so much so that he lost all traction with what started out to be a very original story! I won't get into the canon mistakes that were made when the story is held up against the 4 previous Alien films and the 2 Alien vs Predator films, but needless to say, there were ALOT mistakes(if you go against canon, you start to erase the story, and you WILL lose fans that way, which is obviously what is happening here).You should definitely give this movie atleast one watching. It is very entertaining (albeit predictable as all hell), and just visually STUNNING!!! It has some suspense. VERY GRAPHIC surgical scenes (which I could not watch). It's good to have under your belt, especially if you're like me, and want to have ALL CANON locked into your brain. I honestly hope that they go through with making the next film (which they leave it open for) to fill in as the OFFICIAL Alien prequel.

1475786,A356RFKNIG043B,B005LAIHXQ,K. Swanson,"[4, 8]","4.5 starsPrometheus sure ain't for everybody; it's too slow for horror fans, too horrific for art house fans, too anti-romantic and too weird for many in general. But I've been loving Scott's work since going to Alien as a kid in 1979 and for me this is perhaps the perfect summation of many of his themes and the consummation of many of his incredible visual signatures.The opening of Prometheus is just mind-blowingly stunning, Lord Of The Rings epic but with its own special otherworldly feel. The Iceland landscapes are stunning, and as at various points during the film my jaw literally dropped in true amazement at both the perfection of the framing and the insane depth and color of the blu-ray image. This has got to be the best BD transfer I've ever seen except perhaps Baraka and Up.Add to that the sort of attention to quality and detail that all good movies deserve on BD, and you've got a disc that's well worth the 20 clams they want here. The dvd is only a sad reminder of how awesome 50gb of BD space can be when used for an image this crisp and a soundtrack this wide and how 7.4 gigs just can't ever compare.How much time did they spend making this blu-ray good? Well, the movie audio has 28 different subtitle tracks. 28! Including two commentaries in various languages. Even the well-laid out deleted scenes have 18 subtitle tracks. Normally it's a miracle to get one. The Weyland film they made just as an extra is another excellent addition with lots of good ideas the film couldn't assimilate.But caring about every detail like that is Scott's hallmark, and his exemplary commentary is typically sharp and incisive, with many drily humorous thoughts on the film making process and some great jabs at the moneymen who still don't let him do what he wants, despite a career as fine as almost any modern director's.The deleted scenes extra shows how wisely ruthless Scott can be as an editor; many fine things were dumped but in hindsight you can see why he cut each one, as good as some were. He wants to preserve the mystery and weirdness that comes with leaving out some details, and he gets so much intense atmosphere so often that he makes most directors seem like they're still in film school.Whereas the details he leaves in, with many references to his own masterpieces Blade Runner and Alien and also 2001 and other sci-fi landmarks, all work together to highlight the truly interesting central conceit here: the earth as petri dish for people. If you've read much Sitchin you know this idea is rich with possibility and perhaps even probability. Scott plows into it with verve, and the effects and cgi folks do him proud.There are some cgi scenes here that redefine the art, especially the alien ship cosmos map scene. Wow. Watch that in slo-mo on a good LCD screen and be awestruck. I really wish I'd seen this in an Ima. Sigh.But movies do not live on images alone, and the performance that really carries the drama is from Fassbender, who takes Rutger Hauer's emotional ice from Blade Runner and warms it up to vapor, saying volumes as the perfectly sly cyborg with wry glances and deft details of movement.Rapace and Elba certainly have their moments, and no one is weak, but it's the visual splendors that are the real star of this film.All that said, this is not for everyone. It's too harsh and too slow if you're not totally into the tale, and I could see where it could drag. But if you love sci-fi, the art of film and an epic film maker with a truly unleashed imagination, Prometheus is a delight that will only get better as time goes by.It also highlights various parallels between Scott and James Cameron in both epic scope and idea (each also chose Sigourney Weaver as his favorite hero archetype---the indomitable professional woman), but Ridley is more about the mind game while Cameron goes for the heart. This makes his films much more successful, but I think as time goes by Scott's vision is emerging as one of the finest of all living filmmakers. Who else has done a film like this and also (the sadly neglected but wonderfully sharp) Matchstick Men? Now that's breadth.I've always dreamed of a sequel to Blade Runner, and I guess this is as close as we'll get. And while it lacks BR's once-in-a-lifetime feel, it has a visual sophistication that not only makes BR seem primitive but redefines how wild a movie can look while still seeming real. My eyes are still reeling.The main qualm I have is the music, which is always big but never deeply memorable like Vangelis' incomparable Blade Runner OST. It's the Giger-esque imagery that haunts the brain most here, and Scott's various tributes and nods to his filmic past make Prometheus a many-layered visual and mental splendor for cinephiles with patience, open minds and hungry eyes.",5,"Ridley Scott, master of wild eye candy, delivers an incredible blu-ray",1350604800,"10 19, 2012",2012,4787,"['4.5', 'starsPrometheus', 'sure', 'ai', ""n't"",

This is the question you'll be asking yourself if you watch this awful science fiction film from 2012. With stars like Charlize Theron and Guy Pearce in the crew and noted filmmaker Ridley Scott producing, you'd think this would be almost a sure-fire hit. You'd be wrong thinking that, for this is a turkey.The plot of Prometheus, what there is of one, is about a privately-funded space search to meet our makers. The ship and crew land successfully on the new planet which, of course, has breathable oxygen. They find remnants of a cizilization with DNA that matches human, which gives question to what God created in 7 days and 7 nights. Then comes the standard horror, some awful gory scenes of terror, an admission that the old civilization stocked the planet with WMDs, and an obligatory and completely predictable battle for the survival of the human race. In between, there are a few interesting or watchable scenes including one where a woman gives herself a C-section; but this film is, in the main, drivel.It did one thing well: it probably takes the cake as the most derivative big budget blockbuster in film history. I counted scenes in this movie borrowed fromAlien, the movie that put Scott on all filmgoers' radar, as well as2010: The Year We Make Contact,The Hidden,Poltergeist,The Thing1981 version andSpecies, without doubt making Prometheus the biggest copycat film I have ever seen. There are a few original scenes in it but little else the experienced sci-fi/horror fan hasn't seen done better elsewhere.Prometheus was the mythical god of fire who was sentenced by Zeus, for whom he disobeyed, to be chained to a rock where an eagle would come daily and eat his liver. This kept up until Prometheus was freed by Hercules. There's even some of this in this movie, with lots of guts on display. If it wasn't bad enough Prometheus borrowed from just about every other sci-fi and horror film made in recent years, did it have to ruin it for the mythological figure too?One final note: Charlize Theron, one of the most dependable and talented dramatic actresses in Hollywood, is wasted in this film with incredibly poor direction making her a whiny, downcast character with a Johnny one note dimension. I couldn't tell how well Pearce did because I couldn't figure out which character he played. Whatever it was, it wasn't enough to save this turkey.

1475800,A15XDN628LIEK5,B005LAIHXQ,Lbones007,"[0, 1]","Review of:Prometheus (Blu-ray 3D/ Blu-ray/ DVD/ Digital Copy)When Ridley Scott directed ""Alien"" in 1979 it was revolutionary. A terrifying, tense, science-fiction masterpiece. It spawned three direct sequels one of which (Aliens) is excellent, the other two, not so much.When Prometheus was announced as the prequel to Alien, I imagine it had fan-boys jumping for joy. But do not think of this as a direct prequel to Alien. It covers much more deep, philosophical ground than the original.The basic plot of the film goes like this; The story is set in the late 21st century and centers on the crew of the spaceship Prometheus as they follow a star map discovered among the artifacts of several ancient Earth cultures. Seeking the origins of humanity, the crew arrive on a distant world and discover a threat that could cause the extinction of the human race.That is all I will give away in this review, but lets just say things don't go exactly as planned. Anyway the reason why I loved this film is the big questions it asks; is there a god? Where did we come from? What is our purpose?

(I am laughing repeatedly that the attempt at &#34;At the Mountains of Madness&#34; adaptation has dived repeatedly, and that the &#34;Alien&#34; franchise has languished in a development hell that would make Satan's secretaries sit up on their hooves and take notice.) I like it on its own terms, but I don't think it's a coherent venture. I really feel like the kitchen sink could have been tossed in in order to completely distort this picture! It is noteworthy, though, because it's a film that advocates abortion (check out that surgery scene guys!), and questions the productive aspects of sexual intercourse (this would be funny, if there weren't always something alien or insect lurking beneath the eyes of the fornicator on the morning after). &#34;Prometheus&#34; suffers from the gladiatorial combat syndrome; it wants to be big, it wants to be bad, but it flexes its muscles for the wrong audience, while pouncing around as an unofficial prequel (of sorts) to &#34;Alien&#34;. Well, I don't know about that. I don't see much of &#34;Alien&#34; in this. However, it irks me more that Scott didn't try to make an actual prequel to that movie! This looks like hodgepodge. But, since we are never going to see Strazincysky's film remake of &#34;Forbidden Planet&#34; (a dubious undertaking I would say, since the backstory of that movie leaves a lot to be desired), &#34;Prometheus&#34; will have to do for those of us who are starved for big-budget science fiction-themed epics. Oh, I've got it, why don't they remake &#34;The Thing?&#34; Oh wait...they did, and it sucked. At least we can't speak of &#34;Prometheus&#34; like we can that unfortunate travesty.

1475811,A1KEBJIP4FF6PC,B005LAIHXQ,Lethal G3cko,"[2, 9]","First of all, Prometheus is a prequel. It takes place, many years, before the events of Alien.There are Space Jockeys. What they are and what their intentions seem to be, are partially, explained. By the end of the film, there are still many questions to be answered. Its obvious there is more to be told and revealed in another film.If you're hoping to see facehuggers, chestbursters and xenomorphs (full-grown Aliens), well, you do get to see some creatures, but none of them are recognizable. In fact, these creatures seem to be early versions of the Aliens or the original creatures that the Aliens came from. These creatures have elements of the Aliens and are no doubt, related.I don't want to give away the plot, but know the planet and the Jockeys are not the same that are seen in Alien. This is a different planet and these Jockey ships aren't carrying eggs.Now, people who have seen the film say it lacks character development and the film is overall, disappointing. I agree that the film is a little slow and doesn't have a lot of action, but the action scenes, including a self-surgical procedure scene, are intense.The cinematography and visual effects are stunning, as well as designs and sets. The production is just fantastic.The acting is well done, especially, by Michael Fassbender as ""David"", Noomi Rapace as ""Elizabeth Shaw"", and Charlie Theron as ""Meredith Vickers"".The story/script is kind of frustrating to follow, due to many questions it proposes, but I thought the pacing was ok. It felt like it was quicker than Alien's and that has to do with less character development scenes (which honestly, Alien was rather light on character development).I understand that people were disappointed that this was not ""Alien"" and I agree, to an extent, but that was  not the intention of Ridley and the writers, to make another Alien film. It's a prequel story that takes place at a much earlier time. There are elements of the franchise, absolutely, but this is it's own prequel story.For what is, I enjoyed it and can't wait to see the answers in the sequel.If you read other reviews that are mixed or negative, I just say don't expect ""Alien"".

Got halfway through and the thing just stopped. With some movies, this would have been a relief. With many, I would have just gone, oh well, and waited for the movie to start streaming for free somewhere or come back to a cable channel to which I subscribe, So, when I tell you that my choice was not only to buy the movie from instant video, but also to buy it in HD, I am telling you how compelling the set up is for this story and how beautiful I thought the cinematography and special effects were.My only trepidation came from the fact that I didn't know if after watching it I would ever want to see it again.To this day, I have tons of DVDs I have watched only once, remnants from the days when that was what you had to do if you couldn't find a rental copy at the video store (remember those?). I do not want to spoil this for the maybe ten people who haven't seen the reviews and the numerous websites dissecting the story, but I am so glad I own this. My first viewing was unspoiled. Completely unspoiled - except for knowing that it was a Ridley Scott sci fi project - so I got the full force and effect of the big reveals when I watched the first time AND now I want to re-watch, probably several times, to spend some time evaluating the more technical aspects of the plot set up.As stated, the movie is GORGEOUS, visually. I'm giving it four out of five stars, mostly because it felt a little bit ponderous and confusing in spots and also because the casting choices - I thought - just didn't quite measure up to those from movies of Ridley Scott past. It is entirely possible that I will feel differently upon subsequent viewings, and, if so, I will update.Special features included with the Amazon Prime copy of this are limited to deleted/alternate scenes that would have added a lot of explication and maybe really are better left out. The movie, in spite of its length, leaves a LOT of room for interpretation, which, to me, makes it more interesting to re-watch.Bottom line?

1475818,A19B0WUZCH8I4R,B005LAIHXQ,Lionheart,"[1, 2]","This movie is disappointing in a number of ways. First, the effects are mostly computer-generated, and thus hard to get excited over. This is 2012; we've seen all this before. Nothing looks particularly real, and the actors always have to try to respond to thrilling things that we know just aren't there. In a lot of places, it could just be another cut scene from the latest highly-promoted video-game release.  Then the characters talk unrealistically and act unbelievably, particularly in the intitial setup scenes -- which I found just plain boring. Once the overall plot of the movie is finally revealed, there really is no reason to keep watching this film.Prometheus could have made the Alien franchise scary again for a new generation (particularly because Scott was directing it). Instead, it's just your standard sub-par sci-fi movie. Sorry.On the plus side (and there aren't many points to be made here), it can at least be taken as the first serious effort to reinvigorate the series since Alien 3. It's not comical. It just fails. Also it has a very good cast, particularly the actor who portrays the android (but why must there be one in every film? tradition?)I was disappointed that Prometheus did not even manage to synch up storywise with the first Alien film. If you remember, in that movie Ripley's ship responded to a distress call and found a crashed alien ship on an inhospital planet. Ultimately they found a kind of ""bridge"" on this ship and the pilot dead in his chair, with his ribs broken outward. But in this film, though the ship still crashes, the pilot dies nowhere near his alien spacecraft. And what causes all these transformative phases of the Alien species, from octopus-like thing to retro-alien laying eggs to scitterers to chest-bursters to final Alien from 1979 film? It doesn't add up. What added up originally was an alien species that had evolved for eons on some distant planet into producing perfect killing machines ...The last complaint I have about this film is that it ruins the fear factor of the Alien species itself. The Alien from 1979 was as frightening as it was because it was so completely alien to a human being -- it frightened in the same way insects frighten, on an instinctual level. But once you say (as this movie does) that human-like creatures created both men and Aliens, you link the two as brothers of a sort and thus lower that fear factor immeasurably, albeit unintentionally. And to those who respond that it is MORE frightening because it is somewhat related to man, I offer my humble opinion that an instinctual fear (say of the dark) is far more powerful than, say, a fear based on evidence obtained by science (like that the Bible if rife with inaccuracies, if not downright impossibilities).",3,"Disappointing, but better than the last Alien movie",1351123200,"10 25, 2012",2012,2770,"['movie', 'disappointing', 'number', 'ways', 'First', 'effects', 'are', 'mostly', 'computer-generated', 'thus', 'hard', 'get', 'excited', '2012', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Nothing', 'particularly', 'real', 'actors', 'always', 'have', 'try', 'respond', 'thrilling', 'things', 'know', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'there', 'lot', 'places', 'could', 'just', 'be', 'cut', 'scene', 'latest', 'highly-promoted', 'video-game', 'release', 'Then', 'characters', 'talk', 'unrealistically', 'act', 'unbelievably', 'particularly', 'intitial', 'setup', 'scenes', 'found', 'just', 'plain', 'boring', 'overall', 'plot', 'movie', 'finally', 'revealed', 'really', 'reason', 'keep', 'watching', 'film.Prometheus', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'Alien', 'franchise', 'scary', 'again', 'new', 'generation', 'particularly', 'Scott', 'was', 'directing', 'Instead', 'just', 'standard', 'sub-par', 'sci-fi', 'movie', 'Sorry.On', 'plus', 'side', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'points', 'be', 'made', 'here', 'can', 'least', 'be', 'taken', 'first', 'serious', 'effort', 'reinvigorate', 'series', 'Alien', '3', 'not', 'comical', 'just', 'Also', 'very', 'good', 'cast', 'particularly', 'actor', 'who', 'android', 'why', 'must', 'there', 'be', 'one', 'film', 'tradition', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Prometheus', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'manage', 'synch', 'up', 'storywise', 'first', 'Alien', 'film', 'remember', 'movie', 'Ripley', 'ship', 'responded', 'distress', 'call', 'found', 'crashed', 'alien', 'ship', 'inhospital', 'planet', 'Ultimately', 'found', 'kind', 'bridge', 'ship', 'pilot', 'dead', 'chair', 'ribs', 'broken', 'outward', 'film', 'ship', 'still', 'crashes', 'pilot', 'nowhere', 'alien', 'spacecraft', 'what', 'transformative', 'phases', 'Alien', 'species', 'octopus-like', 'thing', 'retro-alien', 'laying', 'eggs', 'scitterers', 'chest-bursters', 'final', 'Alien', '1979', 'film', ""n't"", 'add', 'up', 'What', 'added', 'up', 'originally', 'was', 'alien', 'species', 'had', 'evolved', 'eons', 'distant', 'planet', 'producing', 'perfect', 'killing', 'machines', 'last', 'complaint', 'have', 'film', 'fear', 'factor', 'Alien', 'species', 'Alien', '1979', 'was', 'as', 'frightening', 'was', 'was', 'so', 'completely', 'alien', 'human', 'being', 'frightened', 'same', 'way', 'insects', 'frighten', 'instinctual', 'level', 'say', 'movie', 'human-like', 'creatures', 'created', 'men', 'Aliens', 'link', 'two', 'brothers', 'sort', 'thus', 'lower', 'fear', 'factor', 'immeasurably', 'unintentionally', 'who', 'respond', 'MORE', 'frightening', 'somewhat', 'related', 'man', 'offer', 'humble', 'opinion', 'instinctual', 'fear', 'say', 'dark', 'far', 'more', 'powerful', 'say', 'fear', 'based', 'evidence', 'obtained', 'science', 'Bible', 'rife', 'inaccuracies', 'not', 'downright', 'impossibilities']",N/A

The trailers were fantastic and I love both Alien and Aliens.  I haven't seen the other films in the series, due to that hearing less than stellar things thing.I think Prometheus had one major problem: it's philosophy isn't that interesting.  There is lots of listening to people talk about why humans were created and what their purpose is which is a question many people care about, but it's irrelevant to reality when the movie is proposing the answer lies with giants in space.  Plus, the scientists have zero evidence for believing the aliens are benevolent creators, rather than people who just happened to visit Earth.  And yet that plot takes up almost half of the movie.Many people forget the pacing of Alien, how long it takes before a facehugger appears and then a guy gets his chest busted open.  The fault in Prometheus is not that the aliens don't appear soon enough, but that what happens before the aliens appear is pseudoscientific nonsense and pseudophilosophical babble.  And Prometheus does improve exponentially once the aliens appear and people start worrying more about survival than the origins of humanity.The casting is fantastic.  Noomi Rapace is beatific and miles away from her fierce, star-making role as Lisbeth Salander.  Michael Fassbender is strangely inhuman and quietly furious at his own creators.  Charlize Theron manages to make herself a plausible villain despite doing nothing truly villainous and being one of the most competent people in the movie.  (Everyone in Prometheus makes at least one dumb, out of character mistake.  Why is the geologist who maps the cave and can pinpoint his coordinates the one who gets lost?)  And Idris Elba is fantastic as always and injects some real personality into the Prometheus's crew.Prometheus could be much, much worse.  But as sci-fi horror goes, it is no Alien.  It does not live up to the promise of its trailer.  However, I can fast forward through the worst babbling scenes to enjoy the true scares the second half of the film delivers.",4,"Not as good as the trailer, but entertaining",1363219200,"03 14, 2013",2013,2150,"[""'ve"", 'heard', 'less', 'stellar', 'things', 'Prometheus', 'Claudia', 'Gray', 'like', 'still', 'wanted', 'see', 'trailers', 'were', 'fantastic', 'love', 'Alien', 'Aliens', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'other', 'films', 'series', 'due', 'hearing', 'less', 'stellar', 'things', 'thing.I', 'think', 'Prometheus', 'had', 'one', 'major', 'problem', 'philosophy', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'lots', 'listening', 'people', 'talk', 'why', 'humans', 'were', 'created', 'what', 'purpose', 'question', 'many', 'people', 'care', 'irrelevant', 'reality', 'when', 'movie', 'proposing', 'answer', 'giants', 'space', 'scientists', 'have', 'zero', 'evidence', 'believing', 'aliens', 'are', 'benevolent', 'creators', 'rather', 'people', 'who', 'just', 'happened', 'visit', 'Earth', 'yet', 'plot', 'up', 'almost', 'half', 'movie.Many', 'people', 'forget', 'pacing', 'Alien', 'how', 'long', 'facehugger', 'then', 'guy', 'chest', 'busted', 'open', 'fault', 'Prometheus', 'not', 'aliens', 'do', ""n't"", 'appear', 'soon', 'enough', 'what', 'aliens', 'appear', 'pseudoscientific', 'nonsense', 'pseudophilosophical', 'babble', 'Prometheus', 'improve', 'exponentially', 'once', 'aliens', 'appear', 'people', 'start', 'worrying', 'more', 'survival', 'origins', 'humanity.The', 'casting', 'fantastic', 'Noomi', 'Rapace', 'beatific', 'miles', 'away', 'fierce', 'star-making', 'role', 'Lisbeth', 'Salander', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'strangely', 'inhuman', 'quietly', 'furious', 'own', 'creators', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'make', 'plausible', 'villain', 'doing', 'nothing', 'truly', 'villainous', 'being', 'one', 'most', 'competent', 'people', 'movie', 'Everyone', 'Prometheus', 'least', 'one', 'dumb', 'character', 'mistake', 'Why', 'geologist', 'who', 'cave', 'can', 'pinpoint', 'one', 'who', 'lost', 'Idris', 'Elba', 'fantastic', 'always', 'real', 'personality', 'Prometheus', 'crew.Prometheus', 'could', 'be', 'much', 'much', 'worse', 'sci-fi', 'horror', 'Alien', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'promise', 'trailer', 'However', 'can', 'fast', 'forward', 'worst', 'babbling', 'scenes', 'enjoy', 'true', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'delivers']",N/A

1475830,A2W00XKTTF1G0Z,B005LAIHXQ,"Lorenzo M. in the Hollywood CA Area ""Movie Wa...","[8, 25]","MOVIE REVIEW #37: "" Prometheus ""Director and Producer Ridley Scott (Gladiator, Blade Runner) is back and unfortunately (or apparently) he didn't read this script very closely. I am a big fan of ALL of Ridley Scott's projects and even his weakest films (1942, Kingdom of Heaven) have had something of value in them in regards either their characters or story - but Prometheus - wow...I was a severe disappointment.Let me tell you what's good about it - It does have two really great performances by the creepy and mysterious Android David played amazingly and hauntingly by Michael Fassbinder (300, X-Men First Class) - and - the spaceships main scientist (Elizabeth Shaw) played by intensely and passionately by Noomi Rapace (Sherlock Holmes: Game of Shadows, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo). These were some of the most dramatic highlights/scenes of the film.The story written by first time writer John Spaihts and Damon Lindeloff -(Cowboys & Aliens, Lost) - takes a giant leap from the original Alien four films and is trying to be a prequel to the entire franchise. The story is full of holes, the logistics of some of the action had the audience rolling their eyes in `you gotta be kidding' style. The theatrical trailer made me excited and eager to see this film - coupled with the fact it was directed by the `former' master of modern-day suspense Ridley Scott.  I was so disappointed. Yes it has Aliens - different in style, face-huggers that now look like octopuses and the incubation process is completely different - involving worms in the eyeballs! Need I say more?The Prometheus crew is assigned on a two-year long term mission to investigate a serious of pictographs found in various Earth cultures over centuries of time which leads them to the race of super tall beings (great CG effects here) that actually `seeded' Earth millennium's ago. Turns out - they - made a mistake - we don't know why - but apparently they create a biological weapon (i.e. the Aliens) to destroy their mistakes all over the universe - apparently.The special effects, the score by Marc Steitenfeld  (Gladiator, Black Hawk Down) and the cinematography by Dariusz Wolski (Pirates of the Caribbean, Sweeny Todd) are state-of-the-art, extremely realistic, very enchanting and incredibly imaginative. Using the production design that reminded my of the first two Alien films in a more cleaner and sleeker design. But this film lacked the story, realistic actions and the heart that the first two Alien films had and it was extremely unbelievable to me.Charlize Theron as the daughter of the mission financier (Snow White and the Huntsmen, Monster), Idris Elba as the Captain of the Prometheus (Thor, 28 Weeks Later) and a mission specialist Logan Marshal-Green (Across the Universe, Devil) all gave some not-so-impressive performances that made me appreciate the Android David (Fassbinder) and the Chief Scientist Elizabeth Shaw (Rapace) that much more.I wish it was better. I was hoping it would have been better. But this is a direct to video/DVD or Netflix film. Not worth $12 to $16! Not a lot of substance.

He was banished, punished and bound for daring to interfere with domain of the gods.Similarly the author of Frankentein called her book the modern Prometheus, where a scientist presumed to usurp the very process of creation itself, and created a monster using lightning.In Prometheus the movie scientist Elizabeth Shaw played by Noomi Rapace, and her partner makes a series of scientific discoveries which shows that we were put here by extraterrestrials, and embark on a funded mission to a distant planet to meet these aliens.While the scientists aims are pure other people on board have mixed agendas. We have a soulless humanoid played by Michael Fassbender, and a ruthless female leader played by Charlize Theron and the mysterious owner of the company.Director Ridley Scott directed the Aliens series starring Sigourney Weaver, and I think Prometheus will please fans of Aliens and win new fans. Like Aliens we have a heroic female protagonist played by Noomi Rapace from the Girl with the Dragon tattoo series. Their arrival on the planet sets in motion a series of events with implications beyond the mission.While it appears to be a dead planet there is mischief on board the craft and danger on the planet itself.The alien planet is menacing as you expect, (so rarely do we meet friendly aliens), and if there are alien life forms they may not be friendly.There are several surprises and some well crafted scenes, which were quite originally done, including the duffel bag, and an improvised medical procedure which I found highly intriguing.One of my favorite lines from the movie: 'We may have gotten off on the wrong foot.'I love movies with a strong female protagonist, and Noomi Rapace really excels at this type of role. If you have seen the Alien movies, I think you will appreciate that he has given a style of science fiction that he pioneered a fresh and interesting twist. Who can forget that famous scene with John Hurt in the original Alien?Will Prometheus spawn a sequel? You could argue that it already has.

Scott makes as well.BUTThe weakness here is glaring. The plot does not make much sense, especially in the context of the trilogy.

Scott was successful when he did this in Blackhawk Down, but it does not fit here. The characters are barely likeable and they share no chemistry. And after all of those issues, it is the plot that kills the show.The only good about this movie comes from the great visuals and sound.

1475844,ALND45MWBGUQS,B005LAIHXQ,Lunar Boulevard,"[1, 2]","Love it or hate it, this film has kept people talking ever since it was released last summer. Obviously it's had a polarizing effect and everyone has an opinion, ranging from calling it a masterpiece to calling it one of the worst movies ever made. While I think calling Prometheus a masterpiece is a bit of a stretch, I do think it's a fantastic slice of sci-fi and it reminds me why I love the genre so much in the first place.Countless others have already talked about the stunning cinematography, great performances, and impressive atmosphere so I won't spend time reiterating those elements here. What really makes this film so engrossing is the questions it raises and, in many cases, leaves lingering long after the credits roll. Now this is precisely what so many filmgoers have been irked about and I certainly do not fault anyone for feeling shortchanged. We all expect different things from our films and I can understand why many left this one feeling disappointed. I won't deny that there are some plot holes and questionable moments; in the end they weren't enough to detract from the film, at least for me. Good sci-fi raises big questions and doesn't always answer them. The first time I saw Prometheus I was mesmerized and instantly began asking friends and family if they had seen it and what their interpretations were. After viewing it again I caught so many details that I had missed the first time around and in the process answered some of my own questions while raising a sizable amount of new ones. It's a joy to return to this film in the attempt to see what I've missed and to soak in the experience time and time again.This film is meant to be viewed and discussed. It's designed to to keep you on your toes and to spark your imagination, something that most Hollywood films these days won't do. I find it refreshing to have a film that encourages me to think for myself and explore instead of spoon-feeding everything to me. Prometheus isn't perfect and there are some inconsistencies that I can't ignore, as is the case with most films. Despite that, I'm simply having fun getting lost in the film and hearing what others have to say.

1475849,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B005LAIHXQ,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[2, 2]","This twice revised verdict contains A LOT OF SPOILERS:This High Court finds the accused guilty of:1) disappointing the expectations of large numbers of devoted fans and admirers2) soiling his own legacy3) dumping garbage in theatres around the world4) insulting the intelligence of the viewers5) wasting the talent of good actors6) robbing defenceless Engineers of the totality of their ""cool"" factor7) wagging his 3D in public, in a crowded area, without any valid reason8) using office staples in medicine9) causing waste of perfectly good popcorn in a world where hundreds of millions do not have enough to eatJustification: A LOT was expected from ""Prometheus"". It is however the finding of this Court that this film failed to meet the required standards to such a point, that it is at best an average SF film, many quality levels beneath ""Alien"" and in fact not even as good as ""Alien3""... This Court finds particularly reprehensive the fact, that Sir Ridley Scott, one of the greatest directors alive, accepted a piss-poor scenario, which, unlike in his masterpieces (""Alien"", ""Blade Runner"", ""Blackhawk Down"", etc.) doesn't make any sense. This Court rejects with extreme energy the argument of the defense, that the scenarist is responsible for this film fiasco. The director is the person really in charge of the film and therefore the responsibility is all his, for everything, including the scenario. Also, as the scenarist is currently hiding in his own butt and refuses to come out (understandable under the circumstances), his testimony couldn't be heard - and therefore the whole point is considered moot and irrelevant for the present proceedings.This Court finds particularly offensive to common sense that the whole idea of First Contact with intelligent aliens was wasted and played at the level of a B-class ""direct to DVD"" SF film. It can be resumed briefly - an intelligent entity, belonging to a race which could fly interstellar spaceships already at least tens of thousands years ago, wakes up and sees smaller creatures, clearly intelligent because they obviously made it out of their solar system. So what does it do? It doesn't even try to communicate, but just starts to rip them apart. This Court allows itself here the right to laugh its (---) off, but with much underlying sadness.As a mitigating circumstance, this Court finds that there is a possibility that this deplorable scene was caused by the android David messing up the communications. The android seems to have learned alien's language from ancient human inscriptions - which certainly did not include phonetics (this is why NOBODY today can say with certainty how the Latin was REALLY spoken). So it may be that what the alien heard from the android was in fact: ""I fart in your general direction. Your mother was a hamster and your father smells of elderberries"". Which would explain everything... All doubts being considered in favour of the accused, those mitigating circumstances will be duly weighted at the sentencing, below.There can be however no mitigating circumstances concerning another weakness of the scenario, namely the fact that a mission which cost Weyland Corporation a trillion of dollars is manned by a bunch of total IDIOTS! This Court reminds here, that the crew of ""Nostromo"", made just of hard working blue collar people, acted with much more logic, caution and discipline than the 17 crew members of ""Prometheus"", who are for most part simply pathetic. This Court acknowledges however, that captain Janek, pilot Chance, navigator Ravel and medical officer Ford are - to some extent - exceptions here.In the interest of justice, this Court presents here some most blatant examples of above mentioned idiocy:- you were selected to be part of a trillion dollars interstellar mission - so the first time you see an alien skellington you panic and run like crazy away from others!- you were selected to be part of a trillion dollars interstellar mission, because you are a renowned biologist - so the first time the guy next to you sees an alien skellington, panics and runs away like crazy, you scream like a little girl and run after him, so you can get lost together in a maze of dark underground galleries (even if it is YOU who have the only map)...- on a planet able to support life you find an alien underground complex and the atmosphere is OK! Let's all take off our helmets, so we can inhale all the local bacteria, viruses and other stuff against which we have no immunity!- a living creature, vaguely snakelike, appears and approaches - let's give it our hand immediately, after all this is how we handle cobras and vipers on our planet - and I should know, I am a biologist!- oops, I am contaminated by an alien organism and there are already little tentacles growing out of my eye - as I am an educated person with a PhD, I will not say one word about it, I absolutely want this thing to develop until I can not be saved anymore; also let's contaminate the others, after all, Mum always told me it is nice to share!- a guy who was missing for 24 hours signals his presence at the spaceship entry - let's not even have ONE LOOK at him, like for example to see if it is REALLY him, BEFORE opening the doors!- two of my people are stranded in a weird underground complex and there are signs appearing that there is SOMETHING alive inside. Should I maintain regular contact and keep a careful watch over them until they are recovered? Naah! Let's just get drunk and get laid, they will be surely fine... And anyway there is no manpower for this, there is only 15 people left on board...- last but not least, on a trillion dollar interstellar mission on a planet which can support life (and therefore presence of predators can be expected) the whole arsenal on board consists of one shotgun, one handgun and two little flamethrowers - and therefore at some moments it will be down to knives, axes and wrenches...Idiocy being contagious, it is the finding of this Court that the giant aliens a.k.a. Engineers, also caught it:- I am a supremely intelligent ancient life form; I wake up from cryogenic sleep and see facing me five smaller, but clearly intelligent life forms; because I am evil and aggressive I wish to destroy them; of course it doesn't matter that I am alone here and unarmed, and there may be a hundred other small life forms waiting outside, packing heat; it doesn't matter that there is their whole SPACESHIP somewhere outside, which definitely must be packing REAL heat (if only for its propulsive system and mass); it doesn't matter that for all I know there can be a whole FLEET of spaceships on the orbit - no, I am going after them with my bare hands, without collecting the slightest intelligence, without even trying to find some weapons, maybe wake up some reinforcements. Tens of thousands of years of brilliant intelligence development = charge at sight and fight bare handed!- I am a suppremely intelligent ancient life form and my spaceship was just downed by those pesky small life forms; it appears that one of them is still alive and hiding in a small sized but sophisticated container; I want to kill this life form! Should I find a weapon? Use the equipements of my ship which still function to scan the alien container and check for booby traps or weaponry? Go find another spaceship and use its weaponry to vaporize the intruder? No! The correct answer is to charge blindly towards the alien container, with my bare hands, without even having a look for any possible traps or surprises.This Court admits that the casting was made skilfully, but many actors were underused. Idriss Elba (captain Janek) plays very well a tough and brave man - but his screen time is surprisingly limited! Charlize Theron looks in this film as a goddess - frankly, at some moments this Court almost had the impression that looking at her hurt this Court's eyes, so beautiful she is. Her character (Meredith Vickers, mission supervisor) is IMPRESSIVE - but again, the scenario mostly leaves the lead to others and her part in the second part of the film is especially disappointing. Guy Pearce plays Peter Weyland, the CEO and owner of the redoubtable Weyland Corporation. But Peter Weyland is a venerable, truly ancient old man - and Guy Pearce is not, which forces him to wear SO OBVIOUSLY a silly rubber mask! Why Sir Ridley couldn't hire just an old actor (there must be some in Hollywood), is beyond this Court's ability to understand - and forgive.An even more serious charge concerns messing with elements linking ""Prometheus"" to ""Alien"". The Engineers, mysterious giant humanoids furtively suggested in the alien spaceship wreck in ""Alien"" (the giant skeleton sitting in the chair), were a very promising thing for more than 30 years - and in this film all those promises were betrayed! Helmets? Really!? And the short scene revealing the origins of creatures from ""Alien"" made this Court frankly laugh (and it was a sad laughter...)Some mitigating circumstances are nevertheless recognized:- Michael Fassbender is the real star of this film as he steals the show as David the android.- Noomi Rapace cannot (nobody can!) match Sigourney Weaver, but she still gives a honourable performance. It is highly appreciated by this Court that her character is a believing Christian, even if she seems to be the only one on board (captain Janek may be the second one, but there is not enough hard evidence to prove this). Much will be pardoned to the director for the scene in which she says ""This is the Year of Grace 2093"".- Another mitigating factor is the scene in which the alien ship develops a crush on Charlize Theron and she in return imprints on it...)))- And finally, it must be recognized that the accused is still suffering from PTSD following his association with a film about Fat Robin Hood and Old Maid Marian...Therefore, taking all the evidence in account, this Court decides as follows: 1. The film itself receives two stars. 2. The director is sentenced to a total of no less than 5 and no more than 15 years of bitch slapping by an alien queen of average size and temper, in a facility to be determined at a further hearing. 3. The sentence is suspended until the opening of the sequel of ""Blade Runner"" - it will be however executed in full if this film proves to be another disappointment.This Court is now adjourned and will drown its sorrows by ingesting Black Slime.

1475850,A17NVM7IAPF2NS,B005LAIHXQ,Maek,"[10, 19]","...I still enjoyed the hell out of it anyway.First - let's get a major (or not considering how often this is covered in movie reviews) spoiler out of the way.  This is NOT an Alien movie.It is, however, set in the same universe.  Do you recall the ship on LV426 in the first Alien movie discovered by the ill-fated crew of the Nostromo?  Ever wonder who the other aliens were, the ones who originally piloted the craft which included the well-preserved remains of a giant humanoid featuring a chest wound that only foreshadowed what was to come?Ridley Scott answers those questions.  You may not like the answers, but the answers that Ridley Scott does provide are plausible and yet raise more questions at the same time.  Where did humanity come from?  Did we originate from elsewhere?  Does life exist elsewhere?  Do ancient sigils hail from somewhere else?  Two archaelogists would love to find out although their opinions differ from the scientific on one end and from faith on the other.Ridley Scott doesn't usually make the same movie twice and if you're expecting a Blade Runner or Alien out of Prometheus, you will be sorely disappointed.  Prometheus (unlike the Nostromo) is lavishly appointed by its funder, Mr. Weyland, and features state-of-the-art navigation and equipment unlike the funded-for-blue-collar-workers' ship, the Nostromo.  Our crew is also well-equipped to map out the areas, although they do take questionable risks at times.Even so, what they encounter ultimately will change the origins of the Alien mythos and their intended purpose may not be as far off from the vision that Weyland-Yutani had in mind for them later on in the franchise.Yes, you'll read in some of the reviews that some characters are cardboard cutouts, some lines are cliched, and it is also not a game-changer in the sci-fi genre, but what Ridley Scott still manages to accomplish is an enormous sense of scale in both his world creation, environments, and scope of story.This movie certainly invites additional outings to be sure and with additional questions to be answered, I hope that he's on board to continue the ride.",5,"Not a mind-blowing sci-fi experience, mind you, but...",1339632000,"06 14, 2012",2012,2125,"['still', 'enjoyed', 'hell', 'let', 'get', 'major', 'not', 'considering', 'how', 'often', 'covered', 'movie', 'reviews', 'spoiler', 'way', 'NOT', 'Alien', 'movie.It', 'however', 'set', 'same', 'universe', 'Do', 'recall', 'ship', 'LV426', 'first', 'Alien', 'movie', 'discovered', 'ill-fated', 'crew', 'Nostromo', 'Ever', 'wonder', 'who', 'other', 'aliens', 'were', 'ones', 'who', 'originally', 'piloted', 'craft', 'included', 'well-preserved', 'remains', 'giant', 'humanoid', 'featuring', 'chest', 'wound', 'only', 'foreshadowed', 'what', 'was', 'come', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'answers', 'questions', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'answers', 'answers', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'provide', 'are', 'plausible', 'yet', 'raise', 'more', 'questions', 'same', 'time', 'Where', 'did', 'humanity', 'come', 'Did', 'originate', 'elsewhere', 'Does', 'life', 'exist', 'elsewhere', 'Do', 'ancient', 'sigils', 'hail', 'somewhere', 'else', 'Two', 'archaelogists', 'would', 'love', 'find', 'out', 'opinions', 'differ', 'scientific', 'one', 'end', 'faith', 'other.Ridley', 'Scott', ""n't"", 'usually', 'make', 'same', 'movie', 'twice', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'Alien', 'Prometheus', 'will', 'be', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'Prometheus', 'Nostromo', 'lavishly', 'appointed', 'funder', 'Mr.', 'Weyland', 'state-of-the-art', 'navigation', 'equipment', 'funded-for-blue-collar-workers', 'ship', 'Nostromo', 'crew', 'also', 'well-equipped', 'map', 'out', 'areas', 'do', 'take', 'questionable', 'risks', 'times.Even', 'so', 'what', 'encounter', 'ultimately', 'will', 'change', 'origins', 'Alien', 'mythos', 'intended', 'purpose', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'far', 'vision', 'Weyland-Yutani', 'had', 'mind', 'later', 'franchise.Yes', ""'ll"", 'read', 'reviews', 'characters', 'are', 'cardboard', 'cutouts', 'lines', 'are', 'cliched', 'also', 'not', 'game-changer', 'sci-fi', 'genre', 'what', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'still', 'accomplish', 'enormous', 'sense', 'scale', 'world', 'creation', 'environments', 'scope', 'story.This', 'movie', 'certainly', 'additional', 'outings', 'be', 'sure', 'additional', 'questions', 'be', 'answered', 'hope', 'board', 'continue', 'ride']",N/A
1475851,AK9UPC78LIPIR,B005LAIHXQ,maelje,"[0, 0]","I find it ironic and perversely satisfying that ""Prometheus"" is getting such mixed reviews. Why? Because it only reinforces my opinion that this is some kind of great movie, to paraphrase an old friend. And furthermore, because this is EXACTLY what happens to director Ridley Scott when he makes science fiction films. Look back at some of the contemporaneous reviews of 1979's ""Alien"" and 1982's ""Blade Runner."" When you do, you'll find a lot of vitriol being directed at Scott by film critics.One tired gripe, which is resurfacing with ""Prometheus,"" is that Scott puts the visuals ahead of the story. I think that is baloney. Yes, the visuals in ""Prometheus"" are astonishing, but science fiction MUST look good; it must astound us and fill us with wonder. Besides, the story here does have depth -- it's just that Scott, as always, is asking you, the viewer, to do some of the work. This is in the grand tradition of another filmmaker, by the way -- Stanley Kubrick, who directed ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" And Scott has said in recent interviews that ""2001"" influenced ""Prometheus.""I am not ready to say that ""Prometheus"" is in the same league as ""2001,"" which stands as one of the greatest movies of all time, science fiction or otherwise. But it shares some of the themes of ""2001,"" including the idea that some sort of alien presence manipulated things here on Earth so that humans would evolve into the dominant species. Also, ""Prometheus"" refuses to answer all the questions it poses, just as ""2001"" did. To me, that's the sign of great storytelling, whether the medium be film, novel or stage play.I think ""Prometheus"" will -- as ""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner"" did -- acquire more stature over time. Meanwhile, naysayers might want to note that as of December 8, 2012, the film has made more than $400 million worldwide, meaning it has recouped its cost, and then some. Clearly, the film is reaching a receptive audience.In addition to its other strengths, the theatrical version of the film deployed some of the best and most subtle 3D visuals to date. I am happy to report that the Blu-ray 3D version looks every bit as good on my TV, despite the much smaller picture. The 4-disc edition (3D Blu-ray, Blu-ray, Blu-ray special features, DVD/Digital Copy) contains seven hours of bonus materials.I agree that ""Prometheus"" is not perfect. My biggest complaint is that the picture clearly was written with a sequel in mind -- the ending practically screams the word ""sequel,"" to be honest. Back in the day, though -- I'm talking more than half a century ago -- one could go to the theater and see science fiction and other genre pieces presented in serial form.Despite its flaws, ""Prometheus"" is a winner. Why? Because, in the end, it is greater than the sum of its parts. The holes in the story, the mediocre acting by some of the minor cast members, the occasional bit of silliness -- all of that can be forgiven, for this is a film that asks huge questions about who we are, how we began, and what we might become as a species. ""Prometheus,"" like its namesake, is overly ambitious, but I'd rather have that, any day of the week, in my movies, music and literature. Far better to aspire and fall slightly short than not to care at all.",5,"SF as it should be: Excellent, exploratory",1339804800,"06 16, 2012",2012,3238,"['find', 'ironic', 'perversely', 'satisfying', 'Prometheus', 'getting', 'such', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'Why', 'only', 'opinion', 'kind', 'great', 'movie', 'paraphrase', 'old', 'friend', 'furthermore', 'EXACTLY', 'what', 'director', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'when', 'science', 'fiction', 'films', 'Look', 'back', 'contemporaneous', 'reviews', '1979', 'Alien', '1982', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'When', 'do', ""'ll"", 'find', 'lot', 'vitriol', 'being', 'directed', 'Scott', 'film', 'critics.One', 'tired', 'gripe', 'resurfacing', 'Prometheus', 'Scott', 'visuals', 'ahead', 'story', 'think', 'baloney', 'Yes', 'visuals', 'Prometheus', 'are', 'astonishing', 'science', 'fiction', 'MUST', 'look', 'good', 'must', 'astound', 'fill', 'wonder', 'story', 'here', 'have', 'depth', 'just', 'Scott', 'always', 'asking', 'viewer', 'do', 'work', 'grand', 'tradition', 'filmmaker', 'way', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'who', 'directed', '2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', 'Scott', 'said', 'recent', 'interviews', '2001', 'influenced', 'Prometheus', 'am', 'not', 'ready', 'say', 'Prometheus', 'same', 'league', '2001', 'one', 'greatest', 'movies', 'time', 'science', 'fiction', 'otherwise', 'shares', 'themes', '2001', 'including', 'idea', 'sort', 'alien', 'presence', 'manipulated', 'things', 'here', 'Earth', 'humans', 'would', 'evolve', 'dominant', 'species', 'Also', 'Prometheus', 'answer', 'questions', 'just', '2001', 'did', 'sign', 'great', 'storytelling', 'medium', 'be', 'film', 'novel', 'stage', 'play.I', 'think', 'Prometheus', 'will', 'Alien', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'did', 'acquire', 'more', 'stature', 'time', 'Meanwhile', 'naysayers', 'might', 'want', 'note', 'December', '8', '2012', 'film', 'made', 'more', '400', 'million', 'worldwide', 'meaning', 'recouped', 'cost', 'then', 'Clearly', 'film', 'reaching', 'receptive', 'audience.In', 'addition', 'other', 'strengths', 'theatrical', 'version', 'film', 'deployed', 'best', 'most', 'subtle', '3D', 'visuals', 'date', 'am', 'happy', 'report', 'Blu-ray', '3D', 'version', 'bit', 'good', 'TV', 'much', 'smaller', 'picture', '4-disc', 'edition', '3D', 'Blu-ray', 'Blu-ray', 'Blu-ray', 'special', 'features', 'DVD/Digital', 'Copy', 'seven', 'hours', 'bonus', 'materials.I', 'agree', 'Prometheus', 'not', 'perfect', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'picture', 'clearly', 'was', 'written', 'sequel', 'mind', 'ending', 'practically', 'word', 'sequel', 'be', 'honest', 'Back', 'day', ""'m"", 'talking', 'more', 'century', 'ago', 'one', 'could', 'go', 'theater', 'see', 'science', 'fiction', 'other', 'genre', 'pieces', 'presented', 'serial', 'form.Despite', 'flaws', 'Prometheus', 'winner', 'Why', 'end', 'greater', 'sum', 'parts', 'holes', 'story', 'mediocre', 'acting', 'minor', 'cast', 'members', 'occasional', 'bit', 'silliness', 'can', 'be', 'forgiven', 'film', 'huge', 'questions', 'who', 'are', 'how', 'began', 'what', 'might', 'become', 'species', 'Prometheus', 'namesake', 'overly', 'ambitious', ""'d"", 'rather', 'have', 'day', 'week', 'movies', 'music', 'literature', 'Far', 'better', 'aspire', 'fall', 'slightly', 'short', 'not', 'care']",N/A

1475857,A340XDQO1NMQSN,B005LAIHXQ,Marcus Harmon,"[0, 1]","Ridley Scott made people fall in love with the Alien films (at least the first two). Now,he really engages us with Prometheus. This film has many magnificent aspects that people will love (if they can see them). Prometheus is a really good and genuine film, but it also leaves the audience guessing too much.This movie is classified as science fiction for a reason. The plot is highly interesting and highly unpredictable. It keeps the audience wanting more. The synopsis is truly amazing. Everything that takes place in the film can be related back to one core concept. As long as viewers remember that, the film should be really intriguing. Also, this is the best aspect of the film. At the same time, it is the most disappointing. The questions that viewers watched throughout the movie barely got answered. They were really replaced by new ones. It keeps you always wanting more, even after the film. This is one of the main reasons why some viewers do not like this film. Honestly, it appears to be Scott's intention to leave the audience wanting more and it fits with one of the themes in the film. But I truly must say to clear any misunderstanding that this film is NOT an Alien film. This is not suppose to relate directly back to the Alien franchise, but it does leave bread crumbs that help viewers understand it's origins.Next, the visuals were amazing. When watching this film in HD, you will love the vividness on the screen. Unlike other sci-fi films, this film did not use heavy emphasis on computer graphics while sacrificing a strong plot. The graphics are stunning and all other aspects of the film are still great. They are realistic and not cheap looking.Finally, the actors are really good.

1475869,AWPODHOB4GFWL,B005LAIHXQ,"Martin A Hogan ""Marty From SF""","[4, 5]","If you are even close to being a fan of the ""Alien"" films, particularly the first one, you may enjoy this.  There's a lot of good and not so great features to this 4-Disc Collector's Edition.  The look of the film is pure Ridley Scott with the graphics, colors and moods.  One thing is certain.  Scott did not scrimp on sets, but the story could have been pulled together a bit better.  The story-line will satisfy an average film goer, but if you are into plot, you'll find a lot of holes here.  To add to that, there is NO ""Director's Cut"" of this film!  That's blasphemy!The 3D special effects are, however, phenomenal. I saw the film is a theater and the effects are not overused and there are no blurry edge spots or gratuitous things flying in your face.  If you could simply see the scene where the universe is shown in 3D with see-through holograms slowly moving around each other, with a character is the center, you'd be amazed.  That in itself is worth the film.  But a home theater 3D system is very expensive.  Still it is worth it.So what's in the box?The first disc is the 3D version and as a collector, I like having it even though I know no one with a system that can play it.  There is no price difference between the collector's set.The second disc is the actual film as it was shown in the theater.  It also includes the options of commentaries by Ridley Scott and the two writers, Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof.  They explain the manic writing force that drove them and how Scott took their vision and `corrected' it over and over.  They didn't seem to mind.  Here is an interesting quote:  ""That is very much in tune with the movie that Ridley wanted to make, which is, ""This is what happens when mankind is silly enough to think they can go and ask God questions."" First off, God might not necessarily be interested in answering you, but even worse than that, you might just set him off just for the act of trying"".The Deleted and Alternate Scenes are what fill in the plot holes.  Ever wonder why Guy Pearce is only shown as an older Weyland?  There is a huge scene as a young man here that completely (almost) explains why this expedition took place.  It was not exactly the archeologist's idea alone.  The alternate beginning and endings really are simply extended versions of what you already see in the main film.  Scott's explanation for the plot holes and some of the placement of certain scenes was more for pacing the film than explaining the plot.  That's a tough trade-off.You also get the film in English DTS 7.1, English Descriptive Audio 5.1, Spanish Dolby Digital 5.1, French Dolby Digital 5.1 and subtitles in English and Spanish.The third disc is more extras, including `The Making of Prometheus Documentary"", which is kind of fun to watch once.  There is also the Production Galleries and featurettes called the ""Weyland Corp. Archives"", which are extensive.The fourth disc is your `digital copy' and the Standard Definition of the film.  There is also a ""Prometheus"" for Portable Media Players.In summary, you could say that the film is gorgeous to look at (especially 3D), but the plot is pure Swiss-cheese, even with the extras that seem to pull the story together more.  There will be at least one more sequel to this prequel and probably more than that.  I'm happy I purchased it, as the price is right, but try not to be too picky.

Daneker,"[8, 14]",":::::::::::Warning, all manner of spoilers ahead, ending revealed::::::::::::::Prometheus, who was killed by the gods for giving humans fire is the name of the ship and a reference to the aliens called Engineers, or at least to one of them. The opening is a DNA blowing CGI fest wherein a 10-ft-tall Engineer abandoned on a desolate and lifeless earth drinks a black genetic goo and is ripped apart at the molecular level scattering it's DNA about the waters of our planet.Cut ahead several thousand years cave paintings thousands of miles and years apart all depict the same 10ft engineer pointing to the same star cluster. Does it seem like weak science, yes! But that's the point, in fact they admit as much in the film. They go on the journey on the whim of a dying old trillionaire out to meet his maker and maybe cheat death. He's got nothing else to loose and he's using his own daughter and an android to lead the mission. So you can't take this as a ""week-science"" issue, because it's a leap of human faith to make the journey and the whim of a dying recluse with endless funds.There destination is moon in the same solar system as the Planet in Alien. There they discover vast numbers of dead Engineers (including at least one with a chest-burst!)and a mysterious life sign that keeps moving and disappearing (and is actually never found or explained - cue sequel)There's also a room of canisters vaguely resembling the Alien egg room but it's a visual only, these aren't eggs. There's more of the black-goo in them, and in that is tiny worms that have grown in it, these become the prototype of the famous face-hugger model.Part of the interest, and some of the complaints for this film start here. The worm doesn't just cause an alien to form, for example, but instead mutates and drives the infected insane. The ""alien"" is actually a more complicated creation, the ""goo"" is unwittingly ingested and the infected couples and impregnates our female scientist, she in-turns ""gives birth"" (through the most emergency c-section on film)and that ""face hugger"" will later attach to an Engineer and something similar to the ""Alien"" of the classic films is the result, and the end.Basically it seems many were expecting the goo to simply interact and cause the first ""alien"" but that's not the case, the film won't be that simplistic, the ""alien"" isn't even the purpose of the film, it's a side chapter.Turns out there is at least one living, but ""sleeping"" engineer, they wake him and learn more secrets, he attacks and tries to take a ship full of the deadly goo to Earth, there's sacrifice and he is stopped. However, there are more ships, many more and that strange life-sign knocking around as well as the proto-typical Alien at the last second of film. The one ""survivor"" goes off in search of the Engineers home world and we see several sequel opportunities including a more flat out Alien prequel (that would be a great idea, really, two sequels, one tracking the journey to the Engineers home the other filling in the gaps between this and Alien.) It would be especially unnerving to find out there was another crew lost before the Nostromo and that Waylend Industries sent them to the Alien ship knowing full well they'd all likely die (obviously they knew something, hence the issues with the android.)As far as ""doesn't explain"" well, Prometheus tells a story, and in that story the Characters never find all the answers, so, neither do we. And that's okay. It tells a complete tale, you could argue that cutting 15 - 20 minutes would take away the questions so people would stop complaining about not having answers but that would degrade the film.This is an awesome, I felt too short (if it's epic, make it 3hrs, the material was there!!!) film, it's not mindless action, it's not neat and tidy, it's more Shakespeare than Micheal Bay.

What made that movie such a phenomenal flick is the stunning cinematography, story telling, pacing and acting -AND the visuals.  The grittiness of the characters, the tension between them before the movie really even gets going, watching them do their jobs -almost from a documentary style format.  That movie stunned audiences and deservedly so for 1979.This movie is a sort of ""prequel"" to ""Alien"" -though not completely.  The movie is obviously well filmed, has stunning visuals and effects, like its predecessor.  Now, to me -the acting was... okay.  You couldn't cut the tension with a knife -like in ""Alien"". The movie does, sort of, answer the question of where the aliens came from as well other little questions, like the ""space jockey"" and so forth.The time line for this movie is supposed to be before that of ""Alien"", though that movie was gritty (it WAS the 70's) and this film is very clean -too clean, almost like a ""Star Trek"" film.  There is no grittiness or realism to the characters -just nothing that makes you think these people could be you, me or anyone else.  To me this is a big issue as in the ""Alien"" film you could actually relate and connect to a degree with the characters.I admit that I did NOT see it in theaters, and ordered it as soon as it came out on blu ray (got a used copy, even!) so my excitement was high, and I admit that my expectations were thru the roof as well.  I also admit to being disappointed in this film... Scott is an excellent director (Alien, Gladiator, The Duellists, Black Hawk Down, BLADE RUNNER!) but this movie feels too commercial -there's nothing in it that makes me ""dare to want to see it"" like its predecessor.

This big budget catastrophe cheated us out of the big question outside the box of if God didn't create us then who did? Why? And where is this location in the multi-verse? It avoided the true subject matter and left us hanging so badly. The out the box subject matter is what interested me in the first place and not the fact it was an ""Alien"" prequel.It so sucked.

1475917,A3FJSHVW02YAK3,B005LAIHXQ,Michael S.,"[0, 1]","Although Prometheus suffers from a few story elements that don't seem to add up, it perhaps suffered even greater from the anticipation that many felt for the movie prior to its release. That anticipation - couple with the ambiguity of whether or not the movie was a direct prequel - set the movie up for disappointment in the eyes of some.The storyline in Prometheus is not original. It is a play on the ancient astronaut theory in the context of the Alien universe. In the film, scientists discover a map and view it as an invitation, which launches a trek across the galaxy that ultimately leads to disaster. Such a story needs to rely on acting and atmosphere to be successful, and Prometheus accomplishes just that. Noomi Rapace is fantastic as the lead, while Idris Elba is a scene-stealer and Michael Fassbender deserves as many rewards and praise that can be heaped upon him. His portrayal of the android David is nothing less than astonishing as he walks a fine line between emotionless and calculating. Although Charlize Theron and Guy Pearce feel wasted, Pearce's viral TED talk is a fantastic set-up for Weyland's motivations in accompanying the crew on their journey.There are certainly unanswered questions. Prometheus was written by one of the producers of Lost, so this should have been expected right away. These are good unanswered question though since you'll find yourself debating them with friends for months after seeing the film. For example, the plot holes and mischaracterizations, on the other hand, stop this film from reaching its full potential. Much has been made of the biologist's ridiculously enthusiastic treatment of the snake creature; however, deleted scenes show an earlier moment when that enthusiasm is directed towards minor worm life forms. Had this scene - which fleshes out the character and his personality - remained in the film, it would have made that scene less ridiculous. Alternatively, the death of Charlize Theron's character due to her inability to run to either side of the tumbling spaceship remains unforgiveable, while the ending sequence with the xenomorph only further confuses whether or not this is a prequel.Despite these flaws, the film is still highly enjoyable and thought-provoking. It meets the visual expectations of a Ridley Scott Alien movie, and provides a good storyline that allows for intelligent debate.",4,"Flawed, but fascinating",1358294400,"01 16, 2013",2013,2380,"['Prometheus', 'suffers', 'few', 'story', 'elements', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'add', 'up', 'perhaps', 'suffered', 'even', 'greater', 'anticipation', 'many', 'felt', 'movie', 'prior', 'release', 'anticipation', 'couple', 'ambiguity', 'not', 'movie', 'was', 'direct', 'prequel', 'set', 'movie', 'up', 'disappointment', 'eyes', 'some.The', 'storyline', 'Prometheus', 'not', 'original', 'play', 'ancient', 'astronaut', 'theory', 'context', 'Alien', 'universe', 'film', 'scientists', 'discover', 'map', 'view', 'invitation', 'trek', 'galaxy', 'ultimately', 'disaster', 'story', 'rely', 'acting', 'atmosphere', 'be', 'successful', 'Prometheus', 'accomplishes', 'just', 'Noomi', 'Rapace', 'fantastic', 'lead', 'Idris', 'Elba', 'scene-stealer', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'as', 'many', 'rewards', 'praise', 'can', 'be', 'heaped', 'portrayal', 'android', 'David', 'nothing', 'less', 'astonishing', 'fine', 'line', 'emotionless', 'calculating', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'feel', 'wasted', 'Pearce', 'viral', 'TED', 'talk', 'fantastic', 'set-up', 'Weyland', 'motivations', 'accompanying', 'crew', 'journey.There', 'are', 'certainly', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'Prometheus', 'was', 'written', 'one', 'producers', 'Lost', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'expected', 'right', 'away', 'are', 'good', 'unanswered', 'question', ""'ll"", 'find', 'debating', 'friends', 'months', 'seeing', 'film', 'example', 'plot', 'holes', 'mischaracterizations', 'other', 'hand', 'stop', 'film', 'reaching', 'full', 'potential', 'Much', 'been', 'made', 'biologist', 'ridiculously', 'enthusiastic', 'treatment', 'snake', 'creature', 'however', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'show', 'earlier', 'moment', 'when', 'enthusiasm', 'directed', 'towards', 'minor', 'worm', 'life', 'forms', 'Had', 'scene', 'out', 'character', 'personality', 'remained', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'scene', 'less', 'ridiculous', 'Alternatively', 'death', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'character', 'due', 'inability', 'run', 'side', 'tumbling', 'spaceship', 'unforgiveable', 'ending', 'sequence', 'xenomorph', 'only', 'further', 'not', 'prequel.Despite', 'flaws', 'film', 'still', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'thought-provoking', 'visual', 'expectations', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'Alien', 'movie', 'good', 'storyline', 'intelligent', 'debate']",N/A

1475920,ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,B005LAIHXQ,Micheal Hunt,"[9, 27]","Well, as you should have gathered by now, this a prequel to Alien/s. With that said, it was more a very try-hard effort to try and inter grate the two together, meaning, it's really only the end of the movie that kind of ties it... it's like it was either meant to be an unsuspected surprise, but with every critic already telling you it's confirmed it is a prequel, that surprise has been blown away, and the ending it self looked like it was included at last minute.The story is probably what you expect from seeing trailers. In 2090 or so, a couple of archeologists/explorers find a cave in Scotland with some ancient paintings on the wall that show a star system. Putting two and two together, they link this start system to a bunch of other ancient drawings from around the world and luckily have the technology to head towards those stars in hopes of discovering where mankind evolved from. When they get there, they find it has a moon orbiting a planet that has an atmosphere that is not quite breathable to humans, but it most likely is the planet they have come to explore. They land on the planet and discover a bunch of structures that they decide to go into and blah blah blah blah... outbreak.The characters of the movie aren't so much the reason I didn't enjoy this film. For the most part, every actor did a decent job in being a believable character. All but two actors. One being the old man who has terrible make-up, and the other being whats-his-face who played a robot (that guy from X-men First Class as Magneto) despite the bad make up of one, both characters seemed very dry and make you beleive they are planning something very sinister only to be killed off in seconds when their time comes (Well, the Robot guy doesn't die, but still), which left me thinking, ""what was the point of all that crap building up to this then?""The other thing that brought the whole thing down was the pace. It was too slow, and focused too much on creating a CGI environment and wasting time with pointless character interactions that lead to nothing. An example of that would be the Charlize Theron's role of being something of a dull and lifeless military woman who you wonder if she is human or not, but by the end of the movie, you realize, it wasn't leading up to something with her useless scenes of showing she is heartless, no, it was just a terrible role, much like the other guy who played Magneto.. whatever his name is... dull, lifeless, almost completely pointless.If only Elvis was around to tell Riddley Scott that he needs a little less conversation and a lot more action, then there might have been a decent flick here, but instead, it did the cheap thing it was most likely written for, to get Alien fans to hear it's a prequel, then suck them into any old rubbish, and end it on a note that there will be a sequel to this prequel.... and I won't be wasting my time with it if it does.",2,I wish I was in Stasis during this film.,1339632000,"06 14, 2012",2012,2909,"['Well', 'should', 'have', 'gathered', 'now', 'prequel', 'Alien/s', 'said', 'was', 'more', 'very', 'try-hard', 'effort', 'try', 'inter', 'grate', 'two', 'together', 'meaning', 'really', 'only', 'end', 'movie', 'kind', 'ties', 'was', 'either', 'meant', 'be', 'unsuspected', 'surprise', 'critic', 'already', 'telling', 'confirmed', 'prequel', 'surprise', 'been', 'blown', 'away', 'ending', 'looked', 'was', 'included', 'last', 'minute.The', 'story', 'probably', 'what', 'expect', 'seeing', 'trailers', '2090', 'so', 'couple', 'archeologists/explorers', 'find', 'cave', 'Scotland', 'ancient', 'paintings', 'wall', 'show', 'star', 'system', 'Putting', 'two', 'two', 'together', 'link', 'start', 'system', 'bunch', 'other', 'ancient', 'drawings', 'world', 'luckily', 'have', 'technology', 'head', 'towards', 'stars', 'hopes', 'discovering', 'where', 'mankind', 'evolved', 'When', 'get', 'there', 'find', 'moon', 'orbiting', 'planet', 'atmosphere', 'not', 'quite', 'breathable', 'humans', 'most', 'likely', 'planet', 'have', 'come', 'explore', 'land', 'planet', 'discover', 'bunch', 'structures', 'decide', 'go', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'outbreak.The', 'characters', 'movie', 'are', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'film', 'most', 'part', 'actor', 'did', 'decent', 'job', 'being', 'believable', 'character', 'two', 'actors', 'One', 'being', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'terrible', 'make-up', 'other', 'being', 'whats-his-face', 'who', 'played', 'robot', 'guy', 'X-men', 'First', 'Class', 'Magneto', 'bad', 'make', 'one', 'characters', 'seemed', 'very', 'dry', 'make', 'are', 'planning', 'something', 'very', 'sinister', 'only', 'be', 'killed', 'off', 'seconds', 'when', 'time', 'Well', 'Robot', 'guy', ""n't"", 'die', 'still', 'left', 'thinking', 'what', 'was', 'point', 'crap', 'building', 'up', 'then', 'other', 'thing', 'brought', 'whole', 'thing', 'down', 'was', 'pace', 'was', 'too', 'slow', 'focused', 'too', 'much', 'creating', 'CGI', 'environment', 'wasting', 'time', 'pointless', 'character', 'interactions', 'lead', 'nothing', 'example', 'would', 'be', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'role', 'being', 'something', 'dull', 'lifeless', 'military', 'woman', 'who', 'wonder', 'human', 'not', 'end', 'movie', 'realize', 'was', ""n't"", 'leading', 'up', 'something', 'useless', 'scenes', 'showing', 'heartless', 'was', 'just', 'terrible', 'role', 'much', 'other', 'guy', 'who', 'played', 'Magneto..', 'name', 'dull', 'lifeless', 'almost', 'completely', 'pointless.If', 'only', 'Elvis', 'was', 'tell', 'Riddley', 'Scott', 'little', 'less', 'conversation', 'lot', 'more', 'action', 'then', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'decent', 'flick', 'here', 'instead', 'did', 'cheap', 'thing', 'was', 'most', 'likely', 'written', 'get', 'Alien', 'fans', 'hear', 'prequel', 'then', 'suck', 'old', 'rubbish', 'end', 'note', 'will', 'be', 'sequel', 'prequel', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'wasting', 'time']",N/A

1475926,A39SJ6V6QCGC37,B005LAIHXQ,Midge,"[2, 3]","We are so starved for a decent sci-fi, anything with a bit of special effects seems to suffice. The plot makes very little sense and leaves you hanging at the end with zero explanation. The really disturbing part is this was one of the better scifi movies in the past 12 years. That doesn't make this a quality movie. They just spent more on sets, props and graphics. Too bad they didn't use original ideas instead of copying Alien.Charlize Theron and Michael Fassbender were the only two bright spots of the film. In fact, their performance was so far above the others, it was clear this film was far beneath their talent. Their presence by comparison, just showed us how seriously lacking of talent the rest of the script, cast and film crew management were. The graphics were also good but nothing spectacular.The director & writers were simply awful as was the performance of Logan Marshall-Green. The rest of the ship crew were even worse, but that was the fault of the writers & director who designed them that way. The actors were only doing what they were told. Conversely, Logan was simply awful like some raunchy stranger you wake up with, after overindulging at a party the night before. There are so few actors with genuine talent anymore. It just makes you cringe to watch them.Obviously, most of these reviewers aren't old enough to remember the original alien. Thus, they don't know a copycat film when they see one. This is not just some tie to the original alien. It is nearly a duplicate from the alien growing in a crew members abdomen, to the robot with its own agenda ending up talking with its head torn off (named Dave, of course. Remember 2001 Hal & his voice?).Then we have a giant octopus generating a claw hammer headed alien (identical to Alien). A bit of DNA improbability. Let's not forget a corporate employer with a hidden agenda. This isn't an alien prequel. It's a full-bore ripoff of the first alien movie right down to the scurvy crew. They had to tie it to alien as a possible prequel & pay them homage (pronounced Ho'mAj not O'mozh) to stay out of copyright court.You have to picture a crew & 2 field professionals who wake up from 2 year hibernation acting like they've never met each other nor seen the inside of the craft before. Who would go on a 2 year journey without knowing who they were traveling with; or who was in charge or seeing the ship before they boarded? Or having an idea as to what the mission was before they left earth?Next we have a rowdy, cigar smoking captain into 60's rockstars and a tattooed punk, sucking tobacco in his spacesuit & hating the world. No one would tolerate smoking on a space craft today; much less in 2093. Talk about selling your soul to tobacco sponsors. It was absurd and insulting to the audience's intelligence. After 2 years in sleep, their bodies would surely have eliminated the need for tobacco-if it was even still available in 2093. I would hope not.The same movie formula which worked on smoking, chauvinistic audiences 30 years ago, does not float today. We have improved society & attitudes a bit since then. Why would hyper-clean, respectable corporate leaders spend Billions on a space journey and hire a bunch of rowdy, grubby, smoking, tattooed bikers as a crew? This wasn't some salvage ship for an ore company.Not to mention building a top of the line interstellar ship to go to the unknown without including a single weapon for protection except one portable flame thrower? Nary a single weapon for the ship. And you ask why we still hang onto star trek. At least they used common sense about the future.Then we have the tired stupidity of having our actors run longways under the path of a tall falling object when a simple right or left turn would suffice. It's like those dumb scenes when someone runs down a road with a car chasing them and never consider to run sideways off the road. Plus, they always have to fall down while running if they are females.I also wasn't happy with the ""everyone eagerly awaiting their parents deaths"" theme. I guess if you are a dropout Xgen addict who can't or wont hold a job... then that would be your only way to succeed to something you haven't earned nor deserved. If this is your attitude, hopefully, your parents have changed their Wills to exclude you. Frankly, I found this dialogue (of someone telling their father he should die and get out of the way so they can take over everything he worked for) quite disturbing. Even worse when coming from a supposedly clean cut, soft spoken, successful offspring who, quite sweetly, tells father he should die so they can pursue their own ambitions with the corporation, money & empire the father built. Whoever wrote this has some serious parental issues. If I was the parent of the person who wrote this dialogue and thematic attitude, I would hire personal security & immediately charge my Will. This was one scary IRL mindset. Since the director also kept this scene (and had an even worse deleted scene for this parental death wish conversation) and the discussion of how ""Everyone"" looks forward to their parents deaths... this directors parents should find this mindset disturbing as well. As for movie value, it really degraded the movie further by ruining any respect this supposedly clean cut character had garnered. We might have expected this from one of the rowdy crew such as the tattooed punk biker type but not the character which spoke the lines.This movie will not fulfill your need for a new scifi but I guess it's better than nothing. The entire crop of untalented film directors over the past 12 years has become pathetic... not to mention the tired, plagiaristic writers with no imagination of their own. I guess this is all the Ritalin generation is capable of doing since imagination & initiative was bred out of them in exchange for peaceful classrooms.If being left hanging at the and of a film without any explanation is a problem for you, then you might want to wait until 2014 and watch this with the sequel which hopefully will explain the story & provide an acceptable ending (if they ever get the project off the ground). Hopefully, they will hire a new director and new writers and restore the characters played by Charlize Theron & Fassbender along with Noomi Rapace since her character is critical to the sequel.",3,shades of Alien knockoff,1354060800,"11 28, 2012",2012,6340,"['are', 'so', 'starved', 'decent', 'sci-fi', 'anything', 'bit', 'special', 'effects', 'suffice', 'plot', 'very', 'little',

1475933,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,B005LAIHXQ,Mike S.,"[3, 5]","I say kind of because it is not a direct prequel.  You do not see tons of Aliens running around on the planet.  I would best describe the story in Alien as an offshoot to this one.  There are certainly elements of Alien in the film, and you can see where Alien picks up after this. If however you are looking for a story that leads right into the other movie, this is not it.Taste in a movie like this will be totally subjective.  If you are not a fan of Alien or Aliens (or similar movies) you are probably not going to like this.  As I said before, if you are looking for a direct tie in, and are expecting it to be exactly like Alien, you will probably be disappointed by this.  This movie does have its own story apart from the Alien aspect which, if another movie is made, will likely be the focus.  If you read any of Ridley Scott's comments about the film before it came out, you can tell what he meant after seeing it.As for the story, it is really about the origins of humanity.  I will not give too much of the story away, but it explores the possibility that humans were created by a race called ""Engineers"" seen briefly in Alien as the dead Space Jockey.  The ship travels to what the crew thinks is the home world of the Engineers only to find them gone and clues to what happened to them.It definitely sticks to some of the horror and sci-fi movie cliches.  There are stupid decisions made left and right by the characters, and if those kind of things bug you about a movie, this one will too.  There is not a lot of character development (not that there was a ton in the original movie either) so you do not really find yourself rooting for anyone.  I do think it is a solid enough story that if it is continued it has potential to be very good and go in a lot of different directions.  If you can look past the weak points and not set your hopes too high on the Alien aspect of the film I think you can still find this enjoyable.",4,Kind of a prequel to Alien,1349827200,"10 10, 2012",2012,1945,"['say', 'kind', 'not', 'direct', 'prequel', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'tons', 'Aliens', 'running', 'around', 'planet', 'would', 'best', 'describe', 'story', 'Alien', 'offshoot', 'one', 'are', 'certainly', 'elements', 'Alien', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'Alien', 'up', 'however', 'are', 'looking', 'story', 'right', 'other', 'movie', 'not', 'it.Taste', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'totally', 'subjective', 'are', 'not', 'fan', 'Alien', 'Aliens', 'similar', 'movies', 'are', 'probably', 'not', 'going', 'like', 'said', 'are', 'looking', 'direct', 'tie', 'are', 'expecting', 'be', 'exactly', 'Alien', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'have', 'own', 'story', 'apart', 'Alien', 'aspect', 'movie', 'made', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'focus', 'read', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'comments', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'can', 'tell', 'what', 'meant', 'seeing', 'it.As', 'story', 'really', 'origins', 'humanity', 'will', 'not', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'story', 'away', 'possibility', 'humans', 'were', 'created', 'race', 'called', 'Engineers', 'seen', 'briefly', 'Alien', 'dead', 'Space', 'Jockey', 'ship', 'what', 'crew', 'home', 'world', 'Engineers', 'only', 'find', 'gone', 'clues', 'what', 'happened', 'them.It', 'definitely', 'sticks', 'horror', 'sci-fi', 'movie', 'cliches', 'are', 'stupid', 'decisions', 'made', 'left', 'right', 'characters', 'kind', 'things', 'movie', 'one', 'will', 'too', 'not', 'lot', 'character', 'development', 'not', 'was', 'ton', 'original', 'movie', 'so', 'do', 'not', 'really', 'find', 'rooting', 'anyone', 'do', 'think', 'solid', 'enough', 'story', 'continued', 'potential', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'go', 'lot', 'different', 'directions', 'can', 'look', 'weak', 'points', 'not', 'set', 'hopes', 'too', 'high', 'Alien', 'aspect', 'film', 'think', 'can', 'still', 'find', 'enjoyable']",N/A

In ""some ways"" it is, but Prometheus is its own movie simply set within the ""Alien"" universe. This isn't the story of the xenomorph aliens of old per-say, this is the story about the Engineers, aka the Space Jockey race (of course there's religious things as well but you'll get out of it what you'll get out of it). If the decide to make sequels its already been stated such sequels will step further away from Alien and be its own thing, which I think is good.This movie is visually stunning, breathtaking even. Top notch quality here. Ridley Scott shows off his abilities to make wondrous photography, something most who didn't like the movie but actually watched it might agree with. The sound is likewise as good, creating a vibrant surround sound atmosphere I think anybody with a home theater will appreciate. I can't comment on the 3D since I lack the glasses to view it on my ST50, but one day I will for certain. Extra's are plentiful with extended/deleted scenes, two commentaries, and a good sized documentaries.People had these questions about the film they felt weren't answered throughout the story. I urge someone to watch a bit closer next viewing: most answers are within the movie, some extended/deleted scenes help likewise. I'm not gonna run through a Q&A; on them, but I have one popular spoiler that baffles me whenever I hear someone didn't understand why the event took place (see SPOILER below).In a nut shell, this is a great blu-ray and while not a Directors Cut with the extended scenes inserted back into the film, someone who loved the film will buy the Collectors Edition simply because its worth it.&lt;SPOILER: one common one is ""why did David poison Halloway?"" I thought that was answered in the film. He was commanded to ""try harder"" and took things the next step. No where in the movie does it state that androids have to follow the Asimov's Law. In a promotional vid, I know not in the movie but this is extra content to flesh out the universe and included in the BD, a commercial for David claims he will do things employee's would consider ""unethical."">",5,To Alien or Not to Alien?

The idea was to do an origin tale of how the horrible creatures came into existence.Tale focuses upon a science team researching early civilizations which leads them to another planet where human beings were possibly created. It begins with clues and mysteries and then leads to violence, action and especially horror. I found the characters all over the board in quality though nobody was below average.I suspect the biggest problem was that the cast was too big for the plotting but I wonder if Scott will come out with an extended edition and then the movie will be better with the extra 30-60 minutes. Time will tell. This is a movie that you see more for the visuals than one in which you appreciate the tale or the awesome characters.Starring a number of known actors/actresses: Charlize Theron, Guy Pearce, Michael Fassbender, Idris Elba and Noomi Rapace.As of August 2012 Fox is in the works for a sequel. The budget for this picture was $130M and it made over $402M at the Box Office.CINEMATOGRAPHY: B to B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus to B; STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: B; CGI/SPECIAL EFFECTS: B to B plus; WHEN WATCHED: mid November 2012; OVERALL GRADE: B.SPOILER: some of the scientists were idiots like the dudes who let the coils wrap around them and tried to baby talk it.

El-Hewie""","[3, 8]","The contrast between the very advanced animation art and the mediocre planning of the crew, in Prometheus, is an afterthought. The story for searching for the creator was compelling in the sense that the Earth explorers, via comparative studies of various Earth's civilizations were hinted that a specific planet in a nearby star-system might host the original creators of our Earth species. Up to this point, everything looks very realistic.Skip the funding alibis; get to the machine that will voyage to the remote planet and its crew. The spaceship was truly impressively depicted. With onsite surgical robot in case of medical emergency, plenty of dream automated technologies that captured the imagination and render the movie enjoyable.Things get annoying when the exploring crew move into the mysterious structure on the remote planet and start violating the protocol of exploration. Even a dialogue between a smoker explorer and a nonsmoker shows the improper embarking on incompetent people for such extremely complicated mission. All exposed individuals got infected with mysterious parasites or DNA altering agents.With few crew members, taking the risk of making stupid mistakes and ending up being exterminated, in order to spare the remaining crew the risk of spread of infection, rendered the science fiction less challenging. There was compelling sequence of events that certain human activities were in process in the parked spaceship on such remote planet. Such compelling logic could have be farther enhanced to advance a more intriguing conclusion than spoiling the scenario with some foolish errors by scientists uncaring about the basics of their craft.In comparison toMarvel's The Avengers, which I enjoyed watching few times, Prometheus is not that kind of movie that would attract me to see it more than once. The few memorable scenes were silent, gray, and not very engaging.One would question the rationale of inserting into the movie a robot of the exact likeness of man, then let that robot conspire to transmit DNA stolen from the site of exploration into the drink of the principle investigator of the expedition crew, which led to the death of the crew member and the impregnation of his mate with alien fetus. In fact, David the robot was entirely a misfit. Likewise, the ship captain performed as if he was a cap driver, with very limited intellectual feel of his role in scientific expedition. It is truly fortunate that the moveimakers are not entrusted with selecting scientific crews of such eminent tasks.Mohamed F.

1475954,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B005LAIHXQ,M. Oleson,"[26, 42]","If asked what my favorite ""type"" of movie is, I'm apt to respond science fiction.  Yet the genre is a relatively small percentage of my film collection.  The fact is that they are rarely done well.  Having said that, a few rank high on my favorites list.  Two were directed by Ridley Scott (""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner"").  Scott's ""Prometheus"" will join that list.  It is no secret at this point, but this film is a prequel of sorts to ""Alien.""  Not that there is a direct linkage, but as Scott says there's common DNA.  Indeed human DNA is a source for this story.Numerous discovered cave art from across Earth have been analyzed to suggest a common cluster of stars and perhaps the origin of human life.  Two prominent scientists, who happened to also be romantically attached, are hired by Wayland Corp. (also from ""Alien"") to travel to a distant moon to investigate the possibility.  Wayland's representative on the trip is a stone-faced Meredith Vickers played by Charlize Theron, reenacting a similar sinister character from the recent ""Snow White and the Huntsman.""  As in all the ""Alien"" films the corporate representatives are never there to help.Other key characters include scientist Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) a true evolutionist and God-fearing girlfriend scientist, Elizabeth Shaw played by Noomi Rapace (""The Girl Who Played With Fire"") in another memorable performance.  The other performance to watch is the amazing Michael Fassbender (""Haywire"") as the android called David.  In an early scene check out how David acquires his ""personality.""  He emulates blond Peter O'Toole from his favorite movie, ""Lawrence of Arabia.""Ridley Scott's return to the franchise allows him to follow-up on the neglected sequence when the ""Space Jockey"" is found in the original film.  Who was he?  What was he after?  How did he die?  Where did he come from?  Some questions are answered.  Some will have to wait for a probable sequel and before we get the direct connection to ""Alien.""  Scott, who always seems to direct films with strong female leads, makes no exception here.  Rapace's Dr. Shaw is no shrinking violet and takes the most courageous actions of the ship's crew, aided by Captain Janek (Idris Elba).  She even undergoes a self-directed but machine automated surgical procedure which will get you squirming in your seat.There are some ever engulfing scenes of the ship (Prometheus), the vastness of space and the confines of caves that are in a word, magnificent.  I saw this movie in 3-D and it looks great.  There are few, if any, in-your-face effects but the overall quality of the camera work is excellent.  The 3-D adds depth to many of the shots and doesn't darken the picture.  Ultimately, the film doesn't answer all the questions, but gives us enough to conjure plenty of ideas.  More please.BLU RAY UPDATE (10-11-12):  I wasn't surprised to find this Blu ray transfer to be near perfect.  Since I don't have 3-D at home yet I opted for the Blu ray/DVD/Digital copy version.  The video is in 1080p as you would expect and has a 2.40:1 aspect ratio nearly identical to the original theatrical release.  Lighting is a major factor in the film.  It is dark (takes place in space) so director Scott and his crew had to manage cameras and lighting to get the proper intensity.  The transfer looks beautiful. Stunning.  Gorgeous. Spectacular.  Detail is excellent.The audio is likewise perfect.  The prime track to sample is the DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1.  If you have a properly set up rig, this soundtrack will knock your socks off.  The subs and woofers will get a workout, but none of the small sounds are missed either.  The great orchestral score washes over the entire picture.  Optional audio includes Dolby Digital 5.1 tracks with Enlish descriptive, Spanish, and French.There are plenty of interesting special features as well.  Audio commentaries are provided by director/producer Ridley Scott and another by writer John Spaihts and writer/executive producer Damon Lindelof.  There are 14 deleted/extended/alternate scenes that total about 37 minutes.  Finally there is a segment called ""The Peter Weyland Files.""

The events take place about 30 years before Ripley and her crew land on a neighboring planet, where they find the same huge alien species that suffered the same fate here. Yes it is confusing at times (hence the four star rating), but I did manage to have most of my questions answered on that one big movie site (ya know the one). It does tarnish the mystery element of the Space Jockey from the first film, but I didn't think it took away anything from the series either. Maybe it didn't reach my high expectations as a whole, but I couldn't take my eyes off the screen.The acting from Noomi Rapace (the new Ripley, or is it the old?) and Michael Fassbender (the new Ash/Bishop android) stole the show. Both were very convincing. Charlize Theron also added quite a bit as well.The IMAX 3-D visuals were clear and impressive. None of the CGI looked bad...well the last minute or so could have been less blurry. You'll know the iconic moment when you see it.I read that Ridley Scott said he will be releasing the Blu-ray with 20 extra minutes. Like Kingdom of Heaven, I think this will elevate the movie even farther than this shorter cut.Smart, beautiful, intense and full of questions to ponder over long after you have left the theater, Prometheus is one of the strongest Sci-Fi films I've seen in a long time.",4,Forget NASA!

Prometheus is a prequel of sorts detailing events that may have set the story of Alien in motion and created it's iconic creatures. So why at the climax are we so unsatisfied by what we just saw? As with all Scott's films Prometheus is a gorgeously designed and filmed movie but, despite the interesting set up about the possible origins of man and the existence of other superior beings, the visuals are a just an empty candy coating as the film goes nowhere with these ideas. We get a story about Dr. Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Repace) who discovers numerous occurances of a hieroglyphic throughout various earth times and cultures which she interprets as an invitation from a extraterrestrial race. Enter the Weyland Corporation (The villainous ""Company"" from the Alien films) who fund an expedition but, apparently with there own agenda. And the Prometheus is off to investigate with it's cliche' corporate villain captain (Charlize Theron, who really doesn't do much but be a company bitch) and the usual suspicious android, David (Michael Fassbender who has the best role). And here lies the problem, we start out expecting to find something fascinating and Damon Lindelof and Jon Spaihts' script gives us a cliche' story of extraterrestrials whose intentions aren't as noble as first believed and slimy corporate villains who want to use what they find for there own nefarious purposes. Sorry, been there, done that. Seen it all before. The beings true purpose in their genetic tampering is never revealed nor does it make sense to leave evidence of their existence on earth when they are ultimately up to no good. Prometheus leaves the most interesting questions unanswered and instead moves the plot along by having characters do the stupidest things... seriously, genius scientists taking their helmets off in an alien environment without any clue that there might be an undetected threat?... Are you kidding me?... I'll admit there are a few tense scenes, althought the film is rather laid back pace wise, and could have used a lot more suspense and energy if it wasn't going to get overly interesting with it' story. And most aggrevating of all, is that the film is open ended. It doesn't even give us a satisfying conclusion. It leaves the most important questions unanswered and implies we have to wait for yet another film to find out how this story ends and how it links to the begining of Alien, which it eventually will.

1475961,A20OMCGB73X5LV,B005LAIHXQ,Moon Donkey,"[16, 21]","All I ask is that a movie make some sense.  Just some.  I want to feel like the writers and directors actually thought about it before filming it.Well... that didn't happen in Prometheus.Let's just skip ahead to when the humans enter the alien facility and find the black goo stuff.  So what exactly does the black goo do anyway?  Does it destroy your body?  Does it make your head explode?  I suppose it does because that's what happens to the alien head they discover it and thaw out.  But wait a minute... what about the astronaut geologist who falls on his face in the black goo after having his helmet melted?  Apparently, the black goo turns him into a super strong psychotic zombie or something.  One minute we think he is dead, the next he is running around like something out of The Walking Dead.  What's up with that?  How come to goo basically dissolves one person, but turns another into a zombie?But wait... maybe it depends on the amount of black goo you are exposed to.  The android gives one of the humans a small drop of the black goo in a glass of booze.  Now you may be wondering why the android would do that... good question.  Perhaps an experiment or something.  Can't say for sure because it really isn't clear.  Anyway, in the case of one drop of black goo I guess it takes a day or so to have an effect on the victim.  The infected guy doesn't go haywire until maybe 24 hours have passed.  But that was enough time for him to get his woman pregnant... which is even weirder because I guess that the black goo infects your sperm or something.  The women gets pregnant with some freaky octopus looking alien thing.Let's explore the alien octopus pregnancy for a minute.  When the android finds out, he tries to force the woman to carry the fetus to term.  Why?  Again, who knows.  Was the android trying to impregnate humans with alien fetuses?  I don't think so.  Did the android know that infecting the dude would also infect the dude's sperm and impregnate a woman with an alien fetus.  I don't think so.  Ok... so what is the android trying to accomplish?  I can't say really.Well, the woman freaks of course and breaks into a special room on the ship which contains a surgical chamber like something you would see on Star Trek.  Wait a minute... how did she get in there?  Wasn't that area off limits?  Wasn't it locked or something?  Nevermind... so the woman gets in the surgery unit and has the alien octopus fetus cut from her womb.  She then gets stitched up and stumbles back out into the ship.Question - how do people react when they see this nearly naked woman stumbling around with a big incision across her abdomen?  How do they react?  They don't react at all!  They are just like ""Hey... how's it going"" or something.  In fact, she somehow wanders into a room where the android and the gang are waking up the really old man who secretly funded the mission.  They don't react to her at all... even the android who knew she had been pregnant.  WTF?Now the film gets really dumb.The super old dude planned the whole trip because he wanted to meet these aliens.  Therefore, the android suits him up and they enter the alien facility in order to wake one from 2,000 years of hibernation.  The alien, of course, freaks on everyone, kills the old dude, and rips the android's head off.  Uhhhh.... Anyone else wondering why they didn't wake the alien guy up ahead of time?  Is there any particular reason why the old dude felt he needed to be standing right in front of the alien the minute they woke him up?  Didn't anyone think that a little caution was warranted?  After all, apparently the team had already figured out that this facility was an alien outpost for the production of a biological weapon (the captain just threw out that thought at random).  Apparently the android had already figured out that the ship was supposed to have traveled to Earth.  Ok then... so if you know all that, why are you sending a 100 year old man to stand right in front of the alien the minute you wake him up?  Does that make any sense at all?To make a long story short - alien activates ship and attempts to take off.  We assume he is heading to Earth in order to destroy the human race with the biological weapon.  Therefore, the captain of the human team pilots the human spaceship into the alien spaceship and destroys them both - causing the alien ship to crash back to the surface.I guess that the whole human kamikaze thing really ticked the alien dude off, so he comes out looking for the human woman - since she is the only person left alive.  He tracks her into the escape pod section of the ship (which is really a large apartment) and gets caught by the alien fetus that the woman cut out of her womb a few scenes earlier.  Except this isn't just a little octopus fetus anymore, now it is giant.  I'm kind of wondering how in the heck it got so big so fast.  I'll defer on the accelerated growth rate, but any idea what this thing was eating?  How do you get that big without eating something?  The fetus thing was locked in the medical room.  What did it eat in there? Ahhhh... nevermind....Regardless... one dead alien dude later, the woman goes back into the alien spaceship in order to retrieve the android's decapitated head (which is still working).  Then, for some unknown reason, she decides they need to find another alien ship and travel to the alien home world.  I'm thinking... oh... maybe that makes sense... perhaps she wants to infect the alien home world with the biological weapon.  Ahhhh... no.  She says she wants to visit in order to ask them ""why"".  Why did they create humanity and why did they want to destroy it?Dumb.  Let me get this straight.  You just blew up your own spaceship in order to prevent an alien ship from reaching Earth.  Now you decide it would be a good idea to travel to the alien home world to ask them questions?  Did you ever consider that this would be just drawing attention to yourself?Also, what have the aliens been doing for the last 2,000 years?  Apparently the facility was 2,000 years old.  So if the aliens were trying to wipe out humanity, then why didn't they just send another ship?  Was this the only facility of its kind?  Even if it was, do they not have any other weapons?  What?  Was nuking Earth too complicated for them?  How about tossing an asteroid our way?  What's the deal?Final thought.  The human scientists determine that the alien DNA is exactly the same as human DNA.  It is?  Have you seen the alien dude?  Does it look like he has identical DNA to you?  I mean... besides the fact that he is twice the size of a normal person, has black eyes, pasty skin, crazy muscles, etc.  Oh yeah... other than that we are identical!  Right.  We have more in common with a chimp than that alien dude.",2,Stupidity in space,1353024000,"11 16, 2012",2012,6800,"['ask', 'movie', 'make', 'sense', 'Just', 'want', 'feel', 'writers', 'directors',

The compound the alien ingested rips apart his DNA, and causes new sequences to form, this is clearly shown in the video.  We are left to assume that his Dna being dispersed down the river forms, the basis of life.  A river being the source of all life in many cultures ancient writings, keeping with the theme of the movie.Then we meet the two Archaeologists who are researching the origins of man, documenting many cave paintings that have appeared throughout many cultures in time.  This part of the movie takes a hypothesis from the strange painting and carvings that have been discovered in Hopi Indian, Sumerian cultures to mean that Humans are an engineered species by extra terrestrials. Reminiscent of Erich von D&auml;nikens' Chariots of the Gods.  The story is well done.  The quest of man to meet his maker to know God, then to discover that their God is flawed, with violent tendencies, at the same time you have a little drama taking place where the owner of the corporation that is paying for the expedition has secretly gone along for the voyage so he could meet his God, find a cure for his illness and become immortal, another example of a man with no faith, and comes to the end one would expect.The story of the God alien is obviously taken from Zacharia Sitchens research on the Annunaki carvings and Sumerian Cuneiform tablets.His book series on the Earth chronicles are a fertile ground of ideas, his research has been known for decades now.  I have long wondered why no other Sci-fi writer or movie maker has borrowed from this man before, obviously the writer of this film is very familiar with his work.  Overall Ridley Scott is an excellent story teller, the film was handled very well, the ending with the Captain of the ship and what he has to do was an example of mans nobility.  The special effects are not over done, which If they were it would  detract from a good story.

Even so, I had such high hopes and was looking forward to seeing it. It does have some truly excellent visuals and the story-line had great potential but it falls flat, and quickly. Here are just a few examples from many*****Spoilers Ahead*****On the alien moon the ship's crew enters one of the `pyramid' rooms which is really inside one of the Engineer's ships. David the android makes a quick comment that the atmosphere is `clean', and pretty soon everyone is taking off their helmets. This would never happen, especially with supposed field professionals; they only know about the air in one room. There's no regard for pathogens, no regard for trapped gases that are toxic and other things that might not show up on routine tests. This scene shows the incredible ignorance of the writer and Scott. Any team would first search and test thoroughly EVERY room before even thinking about removing their helmets.The Geologist and Biologist, oh my, the horrible writing behind these two. These guys are in the movie only to be killed and to provide Abbott and Costello style comic relief. First when they encounter a dead alien body they suddenly transform into whiny little girls- just awful. Then later while possessing a 3-D map of the whole area and being in contact with the Captain who also has a 3-D map (of a ship that's U-shaped!) these two somehow `get lost'- ridiculous. Finally the pair encounter a hissing snake-like alien that is OBVIOUSLY dangerous, but suddenly they've lost all fear (and intelligence) and proceed to try and play kissy face with the monster- then they get attacked and die- unforgivably bad writingThe Engineer aliens themselves. This race is supposed to be an incredibly advanced people but when the crew finally encounters one he acts like a mindless rhino. Oh and the `Engineers' play little flutes to startup their ships- seriously. In the end Mr. super advanced engineer guy tries to fly away but the cartoon characters left piloting the Prometheus decide to ram his ship. So super advanced Engineer with his super advanced ship can't detect, evade, or stop this ramming and down he goes. His reaction is priceless, he knows there are other Engineer ships he can use, and perhaps even other survivors of his race but instead like a big moron he runs after our young Sigourney Weaver clone with the intention of killing her with his fists! Bad, bad, just badHow to get an Alien creature: so to get an Alien creature like in the other movies it appears there's a whole new process: first a human male must be infected with a near magical bio weapon black ooze. Then he must have sex and impregnate a human woman who in turn must give birth to a squid creature who then must parasitically infect an Engineer alien. Stir it all up with an exploding Engineer torso and 'B-L-A-M-O' you have the acid blood Alien we all know and love.This movie is a friggin mess complete with infantile dialog and derivative cartoon characters that insult the audience and expose the writer and director, with this project anyway, as being both incompetent and out of touch.",1,Just a Bad Movie,1339372800,"06 11, 2012",2012,3215,"['What', 'mess', 'movie', 'not', 'prequel', 'first', 'Alien', 'movie', 'most', 'people', 'think', 'so', 'did', 'rather', 're-boot', 'Even', 'so', 'had', 'such', 'high', 'hopes', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'have', 'truly', 'excellent', 'visuals', 'story-line', 'had', 'great', 'potential', 'flat', 'quickly', 'Here', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'examples', 'many*****Spoilers', 'Ahead*****On', 'alien', 'moon', 'ship', 'crew', 'one', 'pyramid', 'rooms', 'really', 'inside', 'one', 'Engineer', 'ships', 'David', 'android', 'quick', 'comment', 'atmosphere', 'clean', 'pretty', 'soon', 'everyone', 'taking', 'off', 'helmets', 'would', 'never', 'happen', 'especially', 'supposed', 'field', 'professionals', 'only', 'know', 'air', 'one', 'room', 'regard', 'pathogens', 'regard', 'trapped', 'gases', 'are', 'toxic', 'other', 'things', 'might', 'not', 'show', 'up', 'routine', 'tests', 'scene', 'incredible', 'ignorance', 'writer', 'Scott', 'Any', 'team', 'would', 'first', 'search', 'test', 'thoroughly', 'EVERY', 'room', 'even', 'thinking', 'removing', 'helmets.The', 'Geologist', 'Biologist', 'oh', 'horrible', 'writing', 'two', 'guys', 'are', 'movie', 'only', 'be', 'killed', 'provide', 'Abbott', 'Costello', 'style', 'comic', 'relief', 'First', 'when', 'encounter', 'dead', 'alien', 'body', 'suddenly', 'transform', 'whiny', 'little', 'girls-', 'just', 'awful', 'Then', 'later', 'possessing', '3-D', 'map', 'whole', 'area', 'being', 'contact', 'Captain', 'who', 'also', '3-D', 'map', 'ship', 'U-shaped', 'two', 'somehow', 'get', ""lost'-"", 'ridiculous', 'Finally', 'pair', 'encounter', 'hissing', 'snake-like', 'alien', 'OBVIOUSLY', 'dangerous', 'suddenly', ""'ve"", 'lost', 'fear', 'intelligence', 'proceed', 'try', 'play', 'kissy', 'face', 'monster-', 'then', 'get', 'attacked', 'die-', 'unforgivably', 'bad', 'writingThe', 'Engineer', 'race', 'supposed', 'be', 'incredibly', 'advanced', 'people', 'when', 'crew', 'finally', 'one', 'mindless', 'rhino', 'Oh', 'Engineers', 'play', 'little', 'startup', 'ships-', 'seriously', 'end', 'Mr.', 'super', 'advanced', 'engineer', 'guy', 'tries', 'fly', 'away', 'cartoon', 'characters', 'left', 'piloting', 'Prometheus', 'decide', 'ram', 'ship', 'super', 'advanced', 'Engineer', 'super', 'advanced', 'ship', 'ca', ""n't"", 'detect', 'evade', 'stop', 'ramming', 'reaction', 'priceless', 'are', 'other', 'Engineer', 'ships', 'can', 'use', 'perhaps', 'even', 'other', 'survivors', 'race', 'instead', 'big', 'moron', 'young', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'clone', 'intention', 'killing', 'fists', 'Bad', 'bad', 'just', 'badHow', 'get', 'Alien', 'creature', 'so', 'get', 'Alien', 'creature', 'other', 'movies', 'whole', 'new', 'process', 'first', 'human', 'male', 'must', 'be', 'infected', 'near', 'magical', 'bio', 'weapon', 'black', 'ooze', 'Then', 'must', 'have', 'sex', 'impregnate', 'human', 'woman', 'who', 'turn', 'must', 'give', 'birth', 'squid', 'creature', 'who', 'then', 'must', 'parasitically', 'infect', 'Engineer', 'alien', 'Stir', 'up', 'exploding', 'Engineer', 'torso', 'B-L-A-M-O', 'have', 'acid', 'blood', 'Alien', 'know', 'love.This', 'movie', 'friggin', 'mess', 'complete', 'infantile', 'dialog', 'derivative', 'cartoon', 'characters', 'insult', 'audience', 'expose', 'writer', 'director', 'project', 'anyway', 'being', 'incompetent', 'touch']",N/A

I don't know where to begin in my disappointment. Just read through these ""1 Star"" reviews on Amazon.com. Most of them are right on - I couldn't say it any better. Personally, what bugged me the most were the characters in the film - totally boring and non-believable, a complete mis-casting. And the movie simply was not scary, not one scene!

1475981,AYBL30P5NXNZ4,B005LAIHXQ,"Mr. Stephen Kennedy ""skenn1701a""","[0, 1]","Watching Scott's re-entry into the world ofAlien [Blu-ray] reminds you that there just aren't enough filmmakers around who really believably create philosophically interesting movies, in painstakingly created universes, designed to both entertain and make you think.  It's a treat to see him back in the genre.  Here, his original Alien movie has been used as a kick off point only.  Although, as he puts it, the `DNA' of that movie can be found here, this is not a direct prequel.  It simply happens in the same world, and has some fanboy satisfying nods to the original.  Here, the tone is markedly different, setting out a larger question on a more epic scale... how were we created? If life can be created in a lab, who then is the god?We start briefly on Earth, where a couple of scientists have found common themes in petroglyphs around the globe, persuading them that these are a map, an invitation if you will, to come visit.  And so this movie is that deep space expedition, now funded by Weyland Corporation represented by the icy cool Charlize Theron.  Of course, things don't work out for the scientific expedition quite as expected once they arrive.  Soon vials of black goo are infecting the crewmembers and creatures start to appear in which the sharp eyed will see links back to Giger's original designs.  Don't go expecting the same claustrophobia of the original however.  Here the canvas is much more open, with sweeping vistas and grand set pieces.  Scott's eye for design is as evident as ever, and the effects uniformly satisfying, not least due to his penchant for creating real sets and props as much as possible, limiting the uses of cgi to areas you might not even realise.  Ultimately though, the movie is most satisfying in its almost arthouse beauty and grandeur in the first half.  As it lurches into elements of action and horror, the tension is never as vivid and the action beats never as shocking as you might expect.  Crucially, some plot elements are just a little fuzzy, and it takes the captain of the vessel to walk in to one scene and in a few sentences of exposition suddenly explain out of the blue what is happening, for things to start to come together.  The nagging questions at the end are mostly deliberate creation of mystery, but there are a few things that are not obvious that perhaps should be, and so the end is not wholly satisfying.The 3D is actually probably the most satisfying since Avatar, in that it is never obtrusive or distracting, and the extras, ranging from the multiple commentaries, 3 hour 40 minute documentary (in modular format to let you jump in and out as you wish) and myriad of other materials including about 40 minutes of deleted and extended scenes, make for a terrific package.  Certainly watching the documentary was gripping and exhaustively illuminating in its discussion on how the details of the design came together, and the deleted scenes help illustrate some of the ideas that were left on the shelf.. and its nice to find the scene that was intended as a precursor to that scene of the Captain's exposition, to understand it was not always intended to be so out of the blue.All in all, this is a great package, of a fascinating, though not perfect movie.  Even where it doesn't work completely, the ambition and vision is laudable.

1475991,A1Y71PWTRZDR77,B005LAIHXQ,Napski,"[14, 45]","First off, I am a big sci-fi fan and two of my favorite movies are Blade Runner and Alien.So it's safe to say that I have TONS of respect Ridley Scott.I was convinced that this would be THE movie of the year.  I mean, how could Ridley Scott screw it up?  He is one of the sci-fi masters after all, right?THERE ARE SPOILERS HERE!!What was great about this film:1.) The visuals and cinematography - I saw this in 3D on the IMAX screen and it was visually stunning!  Big thumbs up there2.) Michael Fassbender - This actor is amazing!  His acting in this film was great, but the character lacked that trusting faith that you wanted him to have because you knew he was going to screw over the crew someway.  In the previews of just him talking in an interview were incredible, but all of that was missing from this film.3.) The operating machine - Ok, when Noomi Rapace hopped into that operating machine and performed the removal of the alien from her, I was impressed.  It was gross as hell, but still neat and very sci-fi!  Excellent!  Heck, we need those today to cut back health care costs!  LOL!Now, what was bad about this film?Simply, everything else, but there was some that annoyed me more than others like:1.) The script - No excuses people.  The script was lousy and remember, it was NOT written by Ridley Scott, but by Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof.  So maybe Mr. Scott tried to do the best he could, but still if I was him, I would have pushed to make some MAJOR changes in the script before filming it.2.) The alien creatures - Whatever they are, as soon as I saw them I thought the same thing as most people...a good looking Squidward from Spongebob.  Man, I almost lost it in the theater laughing, but being pissed off at the same time.  Just do a Google search ""prometheus squidward"" and you'll see the pictures.3.) The guy smoking weed in his space suit - Ok, that was a major face-palm.4.) The guy wanting to play with the white looking snake creature saying ""Oh look!  It's so cute!""  MAJOR face-palm.5.) The characters were shallow and bland - with the exception of Michael Fassbender, everyone just plain sucked, period.6.) The end - God, that ending was just horrible, with the exception of the cool looking alien that emerged in the very end.  Still, seeing a giant Squidward fight that giant face hugger was just hilarious!  I smiled, laughed and said, ""God this movie stinks"".7.) The lack of feeling isolated out there in space - This was one of the best things Ridley Scott was able to do in Alien!  He made you feel like, ""In space, no one can hear you scream"" which was the tag line in promoting the movie.  He filmed in large open areas that were quiet and dark with flickering computer screens.  You felt alone and isolated with the crew in that movie, then throw in a freaking crazy alien with a traitor among you and it becomes legend.  This film had NONE of that whatsoever.  I know maybe I shouldn't have expected it, but I did and that's my fault.  Still the film lacked anything scary, isolating, exciting or even just plain interesting.Now, I have tons more to complain about, but these are just a very small amount.When you compare this movie to other works of Ridley Scott, you would understand why I am writing this.I would be tempted to pick it up just for the visuals, IF I had a 65"" kick ass 3D TV with a stunning surround sound system, but I don't...at least not yet.  If I ever do get one, then I'll buy this blu ray for about $4 just to watch certain visual scenes, but that's all.But even that would be majorly depressing because of everything else.So far, the movies this summer have not impressed me a whole bunch.The Avengers:  Eh, I was never an Avengers fan anyway.  At least it was better than this!The Amazing Spiderman:  Disappointed, but loved the way the Lizard looked!  Wanted to see more action scenes with them fighting.

1475996,A2WZXKO0DHFZXK,B005LAIHXQ,"Nathan T. Parker ""Hallowscorp""","[5, 10]","Prometheus is a visually stunning and entertaining sci-fi movie that largely succeeds despite having elements of its story which sometimes feel half-baked. Personally, I was drawn in by the visuals and the over-all pacing of Prometheus and had a good enough time with it's eerie atmosphere, shocks and thrills - enough that I was able to overlook some weak characterizations and a story that, despite some big themes, ended up being plagued by implausible details.What saves the movie for me is the fact that at the core of the story are some BIG QUESTIONS - about the possible origins of humanity and what our place might be in a bigger universe where we have only begun to understand our place. So few science-fiction movies even ATTEMPT to tackle ideas that have these kinds of implications, so I have to give Prometheus credit for actually TRYING to sail into deeper waters. On the flip-side, Prometheus also had enough thrilling pulp genre trappings (ooh, rocket ships and alien Monsters!) that the 12 year-old inside me was kept happy.The things that are really missing in this movie are three-dimensional characters whose motivations make consistant sense. At this point, I have to compare Prometheus with ALIEN - especially because Prometheus trades so freely in the mythology of the universe created by ALIEN. In ALIEN, all the characters were fully realized, distinct from each other, believable, and crucial to the story. Prometheus has too many characters - many of whom are not given much to do and could easily be removed without having any impact on the story whatsoever. Other characters are a little bit too obvious about their purpose - overtly stating their symbolic role, where it would of been more interesting for us to figure that out by their actions as they respond to unfolding events. There are also moments where the actions taken by characters go completely against reasonable logic and even their established motivations - simply bending conveniently to satisfy where the story wants to go.For me, the faults were easily overlooked and I was swept up in the hypnotic rhythm of the visuals and the shear SCALE of the thing. I enjoyed the aesthetic sensibility of the production design and the performances of Michael Fassbender and Noomi Rapace, which anchored the movie. Prometheus was a good time and did most everything I expected an ALIEN prequel to do, including giving me a few visceral shocks that were delivered in surprising ways. Prometheus isn't as good as ALIEN, but I was able to enjoy it on its own terms.",4,"A visually impressive, lazily written, ultimately entertaining sci-fi romp",1347408000,"09 12, 2012",2012,2548,"['Prometheus', 'visually', 'stunning', 'entertaining', 'sci-fi', 'movie', 'largely', 'having', 'elements', 'story', 'sometimes', 'feel', 'half-baked', 'Personally', 'was', 'drawn', 'visuals', 'over-all', 'pacing', 'Prometheus', 'had', 'good', 'enough', 'time', 'eerie', 'atmosphere', 'shocks', 'thrills', 'was', 'able', 'overlook', 'weak', 'characterizations', 'story', 'big', 'themes', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'plagued', 'implausible', 'movie', 'fact', 'core', 'story', 'are', 'BIG', 'QUESTIONS', 'possible', 'origins', 'humanity', 'what', 'place', 'might', 'be', 'bigger', 'universe', 'where', 'have', 'only', 'begun', 'understand', 'place', 'few', 'science-fiction', 'movies', 'even', 'ATTEMPT', 'tackle', 'ideas', 'have', 'kinds', 'implications', 'have', 'give', 'Prometheus', 'credit', 'actually', 'TRYING', 'sail', 'deeper', 'waters', 'flip-side', 'Prometheus', 'also', 'had', 'enough', 'thrilling', 'pulp', 'genre', 'trappings', 'ooh', 'rocket', 'ships', 'alien', 'Monsters', '12', 'year-old', 'was', 'kept', 'happy.The', 'things', 'are', 'really', 'missing', 'movie', 'are', 'three-dimensional', 'characters', 'motivations', 'make', 'consistant', 'sense', 'point', 'have', 'compare', 'Prometheus', 'ALIEN', 'especially', 'Prometheus', 'trades', 'so', 'freely', 'mythology', 'universe', 'created', 'ALIEN', 'ALIEN', 'characters', 'were', 'fully', 'realized', 'distinct', 'other', 'believable', 'crucial', 'story', 'Prometheus', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'many', 'whom', 'are', 'not', 'given', 'much', 'do', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'removed', 'having', 'impact', 'story', 'whatsoever', 'Other', 'characters', 'are', 'little', 'bit', 'too', 'obvious', 'purpose', 'overtly', 'stating', 'symbolic', 'role', 'where', 'would', 'been', 'more', 'interesting', 'figure', 'out', 'actions', 'respond', 'unfolding', 'events', 'are', 'also', 'moments', 'where', 'actions', 'taken', 'characters', 'go', 'completely', 'reasonable', 'logic', 'even', 'established', 'motivations', 'simply', 'bending', 'conveniently', 'satisfy', 'where', 'story', 'go.For', 'faults', 'were', 'easily', 'overlooked', 'was', 'swept', 'up', 'hypnotic', 'rhythm', 'visuals', 'shear', 'SCALE', 'thing', 'enjoyed', 'aesthetic', 'sensibility', 'production', 'design', 'performances', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'Noomi', 'Rapace', 'anchored', 'movie', 'Prometheus', 'was', 'good', 'time', 'did', 'most', 'everything', 'expected', 'ALIEN', 'prequel', 'do', 'including', 'giving', 'few', 'visceral', 'shocks', 'were', 'delivered', 'surprising', 'ways', 'Prometheus', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'ALIEN', 'was', 'able', 'enjoy', 'own', 'terms']",N/A

Well, that and the fact that it takes place in the same universe as Alien.  Well, Prometheus isn't quite the science fiction epic that many would hope for, but it is a highly enjoyable return to the genre from Scott, and sets the stage for future installments as well.  Noomi Rapace, the original Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, stars as an archaeologist that discovers the origins of mankind, leading her and her scientist boyfriend (Logan Marshall-Green) along with an interstellar crew (including a vampy Charlize Theron, Idris Elba, and Michael Fassbender in a brilliant performance as the android David) across the universe to learn the truth of humankind's origins, and naturally getting more than they bargained for.  For what it's worth, Prometheus doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it does throw out a lot of ideas at the viewer, albeit a good handful of which form questions that never get answered...in this film anyway, by the time the credits roll, there's practically begging for a sequel happening.

However, I am willing to give this some leeway as it is bound to come up in the sequel(s). I am guessing sacrifice and probably I am not alone in this.-- A geologist/gun expert that is so grossly stereotyped and has such a bad temper (no one thought of running a personality screen BEFORE launch, right?) that his (telegraphed) death is actually a relief.-- A Biologist who is eager to abandon all notion of evolution in favor of an alien designer at the drop of a penny. And his sole contribution, when faced with an alien creature that looked like a cobra (fear of snakes is innate, mind you), was to try to...pet it, while uttering ""here, kitty-kitty-kitty!"".Of course, said...""kitty"" eats his face off. As a Biologist myself, I felt shame - and I have to ask: of all the millions of Biologists on Earth, why did they choose this hooded hippie again?-- The owner's daughter who decides to follow her father in order to cause his death and finally inherit him. Would it not make more sense to simply wish him farewell and stay behind on Earth? There was no way this ship of idiots would ever return!PLANET-SIZED PLOT HOLESSuspension of disbelief is a requirement for almost every single movie and needed in a large dosage for every science fiction one. Nevertheless, there are some thorns in my side that would not let go.-- A spaceship that is capable of traveling between stars, entering an alien atmosphere without burning up and and being set down like a helicopter wherever managed to catch the team's eye at the last moment? No one even thought of scouting and mapping out the planet first in order to have a landing plan, right?-- Said magic spaceship can also accelerate like a sports car in Earth-like gravity at a 45 degrees angle (in order to ram the alien ship) and the captain manages to make it do this, not in an g-suit and strapped in a harness, but standing up in his loose-hanging veteran jacket.-- The archeologists were pursuing their discovery whereas the rest of the rag-tag team probably needed the money. But why would ultra-rich Vicker's daughter go on a mission like this? Did she have a death wish to undertake such a dangerous (and haphazardly slapped together) mission?-- Relativity is a heartless mistress. Gliese-86 is 35 light years away. That means that even at light-speed, it would take 70 years to get there and back. Did she leave no one she cared for behind? Because almost everyone she knew will be dead by the time she gets back.-- Okay now, what WAS the plan? Meet with these alien creators so that Vickers can become immortal? Did they have any indication that this was even remotely possible? Then how would they know about the mutating alien and have a plan to bring it back in a host in stasis?I saw it in 3D and, with the exception of the first 3 minutes, it was not worth the glasses hassle.

1476007,A1DK5AZMXS1QA3,B005LAIHXQ,Newton Ooi,"[6, 9]","2012 will probably go down as the year of flops in Hollywood.  We had 5, count it 5, big name bombs, each of which had loads of special effects, a cast full of superstars, and months worth of preceding advertising on print, online, TV, and big screen.  In no particular order, they were Prometheus from 20th Century Fox, John Carter from Disney, Snow White and the Huntsman by Universal Pictures, Battleship also by Universal Pictures, and Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter by a consortium of production companies.  Of these bombs, Prometheus was probably the one with the most hype as it built on the legacy of the Alien films by Sigourney Weaver.The movie was billed as part science fiction, part adventure, and lots of horror.  Unfortunately, it came across as more of s slapstick with gore than anything else.  Scene after scene broke all boundaries of logic, as if people were purposefully doing things to get killed.  The movie's premise is simple.  Sometime in the near future, human scientists discover a series of archaeological relics that point to a star system far away that sent visitors to Earth.  These scientists join a mission funded by a major corporation to travel to this star system.  Joining them is a crew of security, other scientists, and the CEO of said company, Peter Weyland and his daughter.  Upon reaching their destination, the crew of this voyage proceed to do everything possible to risk their lives and get each other killed in a variety of manners.  If you have ever seen the various incarnations of Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, or Halloween, then you have an idea for the stupidity of the acting and screenwriting.  This is unfortunate because the original Alien movies were smart and well written, with characters that generally made smart if sometimes shortsighted choices.  Not here; not in this film.  Whether it be the biologist of the crew getting killed by a snake-like creature, or the geologist getting lost in a structure he supposedly mapped, or the crew deciding to do an autopsy of an alien creature in open air instead of inside a quarantined environment; this film was a series of stupid scenes one after another.  The only saving graces of this film was the cinematography, the special effects, the majestic soundtrack, and the oral language of the alien race; glad they weren't speaking English.Overall, a very disappointing flick.

If you like everything having to do with the Alien franchise such as AvP, then you are probably safe in getting the DVD.This movie was marketed so well with an excellent trailer, complete with the 'aahhhh' siren sounds from the original 1979 Alien trailer, which leads prospective viewers to believe it will be a horror type prequel to Alien. I would have been more satisfied had I paid to watch the trailer looped for two hours, because it had the right background music, the right dialogue, and the right scenes. The rest of the movie should have been left on the cutting room floor. ""Cut it off! Cut it off!""It's a B rated sci-fi TV show at best with interesting concepts poorly executed.Some people may consider the next comments SPOILERS:It's not a horror movie, but it does have all the aspects from the Alien franchise in it such as how the alien attacks and reproduces with scenes that are supposed to be gross/gory but fall flat. The background music was similar to that of Apollo 13 when Tom Hanks was excited to be going to the moon. The alien type creatures looked like they came from the movie Sphere or an aquarium. I found myself laughing half the time, especially when ""the claw"" from Toy Story appeared.I actually liked the concept of the evolution of the ""alien"" to show something different and of it being more of a space exploration movie. I liked the concept of maybe 3 prequel sequels. I also like the concept of what I believe the twist is going to be in the sequel to this movie, which would explain the Space Jockeys' motives. Unfortunately, it just was not executed well at all.Other reviewers, who downgraded the movie, were correct. It lacked character development. Do I need to read their resumes? No, but some more interaction among the crew would've helped like they did with Aliens or Blade Runner for that matter. Then there's the illogical things the characters do. For example, in one scene that is in the trailer involving Shaw dropping to her knees, logical dialogue would have been ""What happened? Are you okay?"", instead it's more like ""Hello. Nice of you to stop by.""SPOILER****SPOILER*****SPOILER - Just as an added side note for people who watched it, but thought it didn't correspond to Alien correctly. Prometheus is not a direct prequel. The Space Jockey and his ship are NOT the same Space Jockey and ship that the Nostromo found. Prometheus was on LV-223 with pyramid structures that are supposed to tie in with Earth's pyramids. The Nostromo went to LV-426 and found a ship that had crashed on its own accord. Remember from Aliens, Ripley said, ""..It was not from there. It was a derelict spacecraft...."" The LV-223 Space Jockeys had begun terra forming the place and were using it as a storage facility. Maybe the sequel explains how a different ship ended up on LV-426 with eggs instead of vases. Perhaps it's the ship Dr. Shaw was flying at the end of Prometheus.

This flick wastes no time getting into the thick of things.... as thankfully there's no long drawn out plot set up to endure....before you know it we are hurtling across the universe on a mission to discover the secret of life. Next thing you know....they are fighting for their lives.Yes this one is intense, well written, acted & the sets n special effects are TOP NOTCH....add all that together & you have a film that grabs you by the throat & squeezes tighter & tighter until......well you'll just have to watch it & find out as i cant just tell you everything... much as i would like too.This is a must see for most everybody as it will entertain, enthrall, fascinate & scare just about anyone even if they have no interest in the central theme as when the explorers get buried under an avalanche of ""unfolding alien circumstance"" you cannot help but feel some identification anxiety....after all....we are all still human aren't we? ;)Add note afterthoughts :SPOILER alert!Ok, in light of reconsideration i have downgraded my rating from 5 to 4 stars for the following reasons.The psychotic violent nature of the ""engineer"" they woke up just did not make sense, i mean i can relate to being grumpy when woken abruptly from a sound sleep but that was uncalled for, perhaps if they had a giant cup of hot coffee ready for him things may have turned out differently? :)The actions of the crew were amazingly unprofessional, case in point..... as soon as they get inside the pyramid they immediately all take off their helmets & breath in the alien atmosphere ... you would think at least one of them would have opted not to risk their life for the sake of bravado.The entire crew appeared to be almost suicidally stupid, as a real expedition to an alien world would have required far more stringent security precautions that would have been followed to the letter. Safety seemed an afterthought or secondary consideration....instead of intuitive & primary.Case in point... opting NOT to bring a weapon for defensive purposes into the alien pyramid was just crazy & simply hard to believe.And then.... correct me if i am wrong but was one of those guys that got lost getting high as they were waiting inside the pyramid for the storm to pass? Are you kidding me? that just seemed weirdly out of place. I think that this was a necessary variable in the movie's ""outcome equation"" to set the stage of believability for the incredibly stupid thing that happens next....when the guy gets all friendly with the little slimy alien ""snake"" thing....as you would HAVE to be stoned stupid to approach & touch an alien life form that resembles a snake!So yeah there are a lot of little things that detracted from the believability factor....yet despite that it did hold my attention & raise my pulse, so in the end it did not fail to impress & i find it to be a movie of merit nonetheless. Well...actually one star less.Ok, i would be remiss if i did not mention David, the deceivious android. As he is the most compelling character of this movie....and the most intriguing cinematic portrayal of artificial intelligence to date. I cannot help but notice a similarity of shared character personality & plot purpose between David & Dr. Smith of the old Lost in Space series. As they both were subversive agents of change that had their own agenda or purpose in being that stood in stark contrast to their unsuspecting star faring companions. I dont think it is a stretch to connect the dots & assume Davids character design was largely influenced by the ""good"" Dr. Zachary Smith of LIS. In fact, it just occurred to me....that David is in an amalgamation of TWO characters from LIS, Dr. Smith AND ""the robot"" [did he ever have a name?] who became Dr. Smiths constant companion & ""friend"" if you will. Much of the shows latter day episodes relied heavily on the barbed banter between these two.Favorite scenes1st one... has to be the fetus extraction in the surgery pod... WOW to say it was intense is almost an understatement..2nd ... Vickers panic stricken race to leave her ship in the escape pod before the collision of the Prometheus & the alien craft & the ensuing aftermath that claims the life of the beautiful yet pernicious Vickers.3rd.... The near end.....when Shaw loaded up Davids head & parts into the spare alien ship & they blasted off together in search of the engineers home planet for a final? confrontation that will occur in the next movie.....yes, it is set up perfectly for a sequel.So, although i look forward to seeing this... and seeing what kind of nasty little surprises David has up his synthetic sleeve, i do not get my hopes up in seeing all the loose ends tied up so that it all makes perfect sense...as it IS just a movie that they are likely just making up as they go along & their bottom line is to make $ not pander to our insatiable need to know.So likely the sequel will be very similar in it's overarching construct....great visuals, good acting, frenetic action, intense suspense & a plot with holes big enough to lose your interest in.But i am OK with that....as the construct equation works....the movie moves with such forward momentum i lose little interest in the plot holes...so they are but minor speed bumps in an otherwise highly entertaining ride. But yeah, it WOULD be nice if it all came to a logical yet thought provoking conclusion.

Idris Elba, Noomi Rapace (who looks amazingly fit!), Charlize Theron, Michael Fassbender and Logan-Michael Green are really always a joy to watch perform. I particularly enjoyed Idris Elba's kind of hayseed captain character, and the too brief scene near the end of the film with him and Noomi Rapace is one of my favorites.The special effects and scene modelling are good.There's some really decent action in this movie near the end.The Not so good:From a science perspective this movie was hilarious. I'll not rehash the premise as other reviewers have done. What struck me was that these were absolutely some of the silliest scientists you will ever see in a film. Here are some highlights:*Spoilers*Taking off your protective gear and breathing strange air on an alien planet you just arrived atHooking up a dead alien head (outside of a hood no less) with unidentified cells growing on it to electrical currents until it explodesDeciding to settle down for the evening in the room filled with unidentified black viscous gooReaching your hand out to a hissing serpent like alien life formThe angry geologist with the nifty mapping tools was the first one to get lost* End Spoilers*I know this isn't meant to be a comedy, but as someone who has worked in a variety of science fields (including environmental science), I laughed a lot.

1476034,A237RLQXTL55RG,B005LAIHXQ,off the tropic,"[1, 2]","Prometheus is a feast for the senses, a grand odyssey and search for beginnings, in the outer reaches of space. Ridley Scott's trademark impeccable taste and ""eye"" for sumptuous design is evident in every frame in this film and reminiscent of the best of science fiction movies, especially those genre re-defining and representative films, the always enthralling 2001: A Space Odyssey and Scott's very own, Bladerunner.The visual spectacle of Prometheus is impressive though it does not succeed in the way Scott's Bladerunner succeeded at multiple levels, from the spectacular world conjured up before the camera to the deeply human theme of the story. We do see a reprisal of big questions here with a vision to match the scope of those questions. But Scott's resurrection of a lost world in the cosmos has a thin story line with its initially promising theme languishing as the formulaic story overwhelms the film.Scott has not lost his talent for making his visuals relevant to the ideas that frame this story, its first and last metaphysical/religious questions. The ship perched in orbit on the vast canvas of outer space has that inimitable Ridleyan cinematic quality of conjuring the horror and thrill of seeing a spaceship venturing out to regions where human beings have no business snooping into. We feel the magnificent aloofness and dangers of this mission in those first ten minutes of the film introducing us to the space ship Prometheus and her crew.Prometheus is a quietly intense reminder of what a director of genius can do with the tools at his disposal. Certain scenes in this film stand as impressively and as nobly crafted as any in science fiction films. The other worldly form of the Gods conceived and depicted here is truly spectacular, even inspired filmmaking. The great scene of a figure in white at the head of a waterfall is Scott's own account of a God giving birth to his world, the ""Genesis"" of the human species. All this is visually intoxicating. This first scene builds up to another visually breathtaking scene in revolving, swirling, shapes in light at the heart of the mother ship, in the middle of the film, with ghostly images of Gods preparing for an expedition to earth to meet human beings face to face. I wish the story of Prometheus were built around these two central scenes to highlight the themes of the creation myth and the prospective reunion of Gods and human beings as the main strands of the plot.But the encumbrance of a formulaic script rapidly dilutes the effect of this otherwise pioneering and thought provoking film. This great odyssey into space and the initial promise of its grand themes are marred by the script. After an hour into the film, roughly half way, recycled concepts of the mythology of the Alien franchise with familiar scenes and situations make this grand poetic odyssey relatively prosaic. The story of Prometheus rapidly dwindles down to the now familiar horror story of a crew caught unwittingly in a hostile world of predatory aliens. I was hoping that the mythology of this creation of Gods and monsters would have a more expansive premise. If only the film had continued to emphasize the odyssey, this quest to seek out human origins, the mystery and promise of its magnificent opening, this would have been a film for the ages.Even if Prometheus quickly dilutes the sense of wonder that it initially conjures with its stunning visual conception of an early earthly paradise and its Gods, the sheer spectacle of Scott's vision of Gods and the space they inhabit shines through the weak plot. Scott's visual conception of the God-like species, his account of the genesis of human life is undeniably stirring. He has also succeeded in creating the poetic, even religious, pathos of a grander species succumbing to a more primitive, destructive, logic of predators. Scott resurrects this powerful myth that he had brought to life once before with unforgettable pathos in 2019 Los Angeles in Bladerunner but the voyage out to a forbidden planet in 2093 in Prometheus is an empty myth that starts so promisingly.Noomi Rapace, as Dr. Shaw, the archeologist, is cast in the same mold as Sigourney Weaver. She is an intense presence on screen, entirely believable, as the intellectually driven, conflicted, and guilt ridden doctor who will be the very personification of the sort of human being that is alternately envied and admired by the mercurial resident android of Weyland Corporations's Prometheus spaceship, David (Michael Fassbender). Charlize Theron was initially considered for the main part but she is convincingly cold and tragic as Vickers, the director of the mission, in league with the powers that be who have financed the ""Prometheus"" enterprise.Michael Fassbender, as the alternately reliable and resentful android, programmed to look after the crew of Prometheus and its larger mission puts together another brilliantly crafted performance. Fassbender is a force in Hollywood and for good reason; there is nothing this actor cannot do. His performance as an efficient but emotionally erratic android carrying out its duties with a growing sense of resentment for the crew is an effortlessly fluid performance. The performance brings out the chilling elegance of David's persona easily making it the centerpiece and attraction of this film. David is fully conscious of the advantages of not being human. His privileged role in this mission in search for human origins is acknowledged in his beaming face. When the crew is in ""stasis"" in their cryogenic chambers on the way to their destination he meticulously manages the ship with intelligent efficiency.Promising themes and ideas by themselves are not sufficient to do justice to a film of this imaginative scope. The story has to be built around these themes. It is difficult to stay interested in a cliched, tired, story, after four ""Alien"" films, of seeing a reckless crew bring in the slime, the ooze, the gore, to make themselves hospitable hosts for the hideous life forms that take life within them. But those contemplative moments in scenes of astonishing visual beauty redeems this film, in part. The sheer scale and detail of the digital art in display here is well worth seeing. There are scenes in this film that can be put up in museums to illustrate a sense of beauty that is unsurpassed in cinema .Prometheus is a flawed masterpiece that I recommend seeing. As a tantalizingly suggestive excursion into the origins of life and death, Gods and monsters, implicit in the Alien franchise, this film is worth a look.  But the world of Prometheus hardly lifts off in this theological sense as its great predecessor Bladerunner did, and only ends up being a magnificent possibility. Prometheus began with a stirring glimpse of a crumbling God and in the end this is an apt metaphor to describe how the beauty and loftiness of this film and its theme are undone and marred by the ordinariness, the predictability, of its story.  One is left with a sense of regret that the vast conception of this film was not allowed to develop at all.  Prometheus is an imposing work of beauty, brilliantly conceiving an enigmatic God. This exquisitely well crafted but marred film stands in my memory, like the God of legend re-imagined in its memorable first scene, a crumbling titan, a God in ruins",3,Prometheus: A God In

But was so intrigued by all the comments and an especially long thread started by 1 review I simply could not resist. Yes there are flaws in this movie, the biologist behaved like a teenage girl finding a kitten upon discovering an obviously hostile alien, the geologist probably got his degree from a struggling junior college or in prison, as for David the android he had his own somewhat twisted agenda. As for the other characters most played their roles well and were crewmen not scientists. There are other minor inconsistancies and any movie can be dissected ad-nausium if you want to put your mind in ""attack"" mode and seek out flaws. Overall I enjoyed this flic very much and am relieved that I did not feel I wasted $5. The special effects were truly fantastic, the story was well written though as indicated in my title flawed in some respects, but certainly not fatally flawed. The ending was a suprise and I will not give it away though in the original Alien movie the pilot of the alien ship was found in the pilots seat with injuries indicating an alien had sprung from his chest (I'm just saying its a bit of a headscratcher).

This is, of course, the stuff of Erich von D&auml;niken, fashionable as long ago as the 1970s but long since discredited. Nonetheless, Shaw and Holloway propose a multi-billion dollar, ten year expedition to a remote star system to further investigate. Elderly philanthropist Weyland (a rubber-suited Guy Pierce) green-lights the proposal.It must have been one hell of a business pitch.We jump forward a further four years and 50 billion light years (the laws of physics being due an overhaul between now and 2090) to the spaceship Prometheus, which has arrived at that star system. Without ado the ship fetches up on a blasted, steaming landscape, adjacent to a quitevon D&auml;nikenesquearchaeological complex.House android David (an excellently Hal-like Michael Fassbinder) and ship commander Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron) are busily waking up their scientists and nursing hidden agendas. It quickly becomes clear that the crew of scientists, shaken from their stupor, have their own agendas too. Thus do we conform to the deep space adventure playbook established by the likes of2001: A Space Odysseyand, well, Alien. Yet note a dissonance here: just as the dialogue starts in earnest, Scott shifts our gaze from the reverend contemplation of the immortal to the petty melodramas of some new characters with whom we cannot, yet, empathise. Naturally there are figurative parallels but, all the same, this shift in perspective risks rendering the cosmic mundane.I mention this because but for the wonderful production design and those grand metaphysical thoughts there is really nothing really new about the first hour of Prometheus. It is to Alien what2010: The Year We Make Contactwas to 2001. In place of ineffable profundity there is talky exposition.Ridley Scott renders the cosmic mundane in another way too: We are treated again to HR Giger's stunning necro-organic architecture, rendered briefly in Alien and largely unexplained in the form of a ghastly skeleton with a blown out rib-cage. But this time Scott indulges in exposition: he begins to fill in the details of this race of &Uuml;bermensch, ascribing them motives and agendas. We even meet one. It was better not knowing.In Alien the titillating ambiguity of their remnants left the job of world construction to the viewer. In Prometheus Scott takes away the viewer's autonomy,Aliendictates a back story, and opens himself wide to plot illogicalities and non-sequiturs. Disappointingly the Engineers' motivations are base, predictable, and not worthy of the phallic grandeur of Giger's production design.By half time in this two hour picture the studied monkishness of its opening has entirely given way to melodramatic space opera, rendered in haphazardly-directed action set pieces. As convention dictates, the dysfunctional crew must be picked off, but this is accompanied by none of the grimness of Scott's original, because the characters are only caricatures of the real men and women we met aboard the Nostromo.There are, generally, too many of them, and they spend too much of the picture gabbing at each other in the meter of stock Hollywood dialogue, depriving the screenplay of the air it needs to work up a genuine chill or to properly frame its grand eternal cogitations.  There are about three false summits before the final denouement, which falls on an offbeat not quite accented enough to justify its build up.This makes me sound too negative: I enjoyed Prometheus a great deal, but hoped to enjoy it immensely more still. It is a beautiful picture to look at, and many of the action set pieces are well executed (Noomi Rapace has her own John Hurt moment, self-inflicted, and it is in equal parts horrifying and (deliberately) hilarious.Ridley Scott has famously railed against studio demands to tinker with the final edits of his pictures. Here, I suspect he had full autonomy. I left the cinema wondering what might have been had someone been more assiduous in that regard: this is a good movie which could have been made great had there been a director more prepared to cut.Olly Buxton",4,The cosmic rendered mundane,1338681600,"06 3, 2012",2012,5208,"['Prometheus', 'was', 'titan', 'who', 'stole', 'fire', 'Gods', 'gave', 'humans', 'prevented', 'Zeus', 'obliterating',

The film looks really slick on dvd and the story makes more sense when you watch it the second time. The film, while having an intelligent premise , unfortunately also has numerous gaping plotholes -  such as the so-called scientists thinking its ok to remove their helmets on an alien planet just because the air is breathable or  our heroine being able to perform major surgery on herself. The film will also not decisively answer the questions that you have had ever since seeing the dead ""Spacejockey"" in the original Alien.  It only partially confirms the theory of the Aliens having been created as bioweapons by the Engineers - but it isn't really conclusive. You will only be left with more questions. In a way that's good because it stimulates speculation and debate until the sequel (if there is one) arrives. But its also bad because we could have learnt and seen more of the Engineer's and their civilisation. Ridley obviously decided that less is more as the Engineers have very little screen time. More attention seems to have been focused on the (presumably first) synthetic David and his interactions and motivations. But as I said what you do see looks quite polished, its just somewhat lacking in scope.

I must say I have had very high expectations of this film since I first caught wind of it. The original Alien film is by far my favorite movie of all time, it's original and brilliantly directed. The perfect blend of sci-fi and horror is exactly the type of movies love.The idea behind Prometheus is that Ridley Scott did not want to trespass on his original masterpiece from 1979, Alien. Prometheus is a prequel yes, however it is very original and is o so careful about not overstepping it's boundaries into the Alien film series. It is extremely well done and well written with solid acting and amazing special effects. Those who are not true fans or do not know Ridley will not understand why he was so careful with this film. Of his 30+ directed movies, this is only his third sci-fi film. The others being the original Alien 1979 and Blade Runner 1982 (also, he is currently working on a new Blade Runner project).Prometheus does start off a little slow, simply to build the tension for the remainder of the film. The cast was perfectly chosen and each character has a strong, solid personality. The special effects are quite natural and realistic looking, they did an amazing job. The last 45 minutes of the movie are very intense and it is almost too wild for your mind to keep up with. The sets and models are huge and very detailed and each shot is naturally filmed which glues your eyes to the screen.Those who are expecting a new film just like Alien may be disappointed due to the fact that this is an entirely new story built in as a early prequel to Alien. I also could see them making a sequel to Prometheus, which would be another prequel to Alien.For true fans, Prometheus will not disappoint. It is new, fresh and is the untold story of one of the best sci-fi films of all time. Prometheus is less horror and more of a solid sci-fi film, don't get me wrong, there are plenty of scary moments and parts which will make you jump, but it seems like it had less of a focus on the horror aspect. This is one of those movies which is very deep on many levels and you must contemplate the movie after you watch it.

I'm glad I did. The 3D visuals are pretty much outstanding throughout, set in razor-sharp perspective. So yes, it is worth the extra couiple of dollars to see this in 3D, at least in the theatre. I have no idea how well the 3D version will translate to your TV screen.As to the movie itself, while the story seemed a bit overly complicated at time, once the movie got rolling about 45 minutes into it, it was a non-stop riveting ride to the very end. At first I thought that Noomi ""Dragon Tattoo"" Rapace was miscast as Elizabeth Shaw, but I most surely changed my mind after seeing what she goes through in the second half of the movie, and in fact I think her performance stacks up well to Sigourney Weaver's. Michael Fassbender's performance as the human-like robot David is also worth mentioning.A special mention must be made about the movie's outstanding visuals. It really felt as rich as say ""Avatar"". As I was watching the movie, I couln't help but think to myself, ""this sure looks like one heck of an expensive movie"". Curiosity got the better of me so I looked it up, and indeed the production costs alone (never mind the marketing costs) are estimated at $125 million. Amazing. Even though the movie's ending is left fairly wide open with a clear path for a ""prequel-sequel"", I don't know that the studio will even greenlight it, unless ""Prometheus"" is a big hit (which is not likely; I wash shocked how poorly attended the huge theatre was that I saw this in).

1476063,AVTICTX2MD3NR,B005LAIHXQ,Paula Varjack,"[35, 45]","Part ALIEN VS PREDATOR and part Chariots of the Gods, PROMETHEUS is a beautiful but convoluted mess of a movie that manages to breath a tiny bit of life into an old franchise, but not much else.The plot - which is more or less explained in the trailers - is fairly simple:  80 years into the future scientists find evidence that aliens have been to earth - and that they've left a clue as to where to meet them.  Naturally, we go to find out what all the cave drawings are about and predictably, things go terribly wrong.Considering that PROMETHEUS is set in the ALIEN universe (something that only the newest trailers even admit to), nearly every ALIEN fan will immediately recognize the similarities - the alien world, a morally corrupt robot, a large corporation with it own designs, and lots of space ship stuff (both alien in nature and human).  Which is all well and good, but somehow returning director Ridley Scott and writers Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof still manage to step on their dicks, despite a massive budget and familiar stomping grounds.The plot is simple, which is fine (it is a prequel to a movie who's sole original purpose was to have someones chest explode from the inside out after all), but so are the characters - all very one dimensional, very flat.  Some of that's because it's just not a great cast - the ""Ripley"" type character is played by Noomi Rapace who is a fine actor, but simply doesn't have either the charisma or physique to pull off her role in this film.  Other roles are just as flat.  Ironically, only Michael Fassbender as the robot is interesting in the slightest.Besides the flatness of characters, they also act unbelievably - a death knell for any scifi movie, no matter how big the sets.  Characters take off their helmets in what's clearly a f'd up looking spaceship where shit's gone wrong - 'cause that's safe.  When they discover what should be the biggest thing in history, they seem no more amazed then if they had just bought a Happy Meal and the toy was broken.  They then leave that discovery because it will be getting cold outside - not 150 degrees below zero cold mind you, just cold.  I guess the trillion dollar expedition forgot to bring matches for a fire.  Just totally unbelievable.No sense from the script (which is set so relatively near in the future) if there's even been any other alien life discovered before this trip or even when warp drive was discovered.  It doesn't seem like the adventure of a life time to these characters (which of course it should), but more like a pain in the ass trip to the corner store for diapers.  When they see the giant human head statue found on a deserted world in the middle of dead space, no one bats so much as an eyelash.  Absolutely the wrong tone.  Even the characters in the original ALIEN - who were nothing but glorified space truckers - took more glee in their potential discovery.Equally stupid are the character's actions - Somehow 2 characters get lost 50 feet from the front door of the alien ship.... then even more inexplicably are left behind there b/c no one knows they're missing.  One guy gets infected by what I guess is an alien, but says NOTHING (you know, even though they're on a trillion dollar scientific research spaceship).  Just dumb, both in believability and in tone.Just as wrong in tone is the music, which half the time is brilliant (when he channels Jerry Goldsmith) and the rest of the time is just awful.  For some unknown reason, Scott must have instructed composer Marc Streitenfeld to write ""hero"" music for the ""Prometheus"" alien, which any time it's played take one immediately out of any sort of suspense that might have built up to that point.  Absolutely stupid and again it makes one wonder just how Scott could have made such a plainly wrong decision - it is a horror movie after all, right?  At other times, when the shit hits the fan, the music is so loud and so wrong that it literally kills any danger that characters you barely care about might be in.And lastly, the continuity errors.  Just oodles of them when compared to the original, including two so huge they had to be on purpose... didn't they?In the end, you really have to ask yourself why this movie was made.  Whatever it does for the storyline could have been done in about a 1/4 of the screen time - and regardless of the storytelling (or lack thereof), it covers much of the same ground that ALIEN V PREDATOR did (without ever telling the audience whether or not we should consider that movie canon or not).  If I sound frustrated, that's because I am.  The ALIEN universe is a cool one, with more then enough story-lines to do something new.  The ""revelations"" this movie shows us are A) predictable and B) underwhelming, both in scope and execution.  At times, just when you think the movie might pull it's feet from the blah mire it's in and reach something special, it falls right back into the goop.Simply put, a movie set in that universe with a $150 plus million budget aught not be so average.  It feels like it should be a great film, or at least a very good film (mostly because of the amazing sets and CG work), but in the end it's terribly blah.  In the end, I'd have to say that AVP is actually a better movie, b/c while that film doesn't reach nearly so high, it does actually achieve what it sets out to do.Hate to say it, but after ROBIN HOOD and now this, it's clear that Ridley's lost it.BOTTOM LINE:  3 I think Michael Fassbender looks like a young Peter O'Toole too! out of 5",3,A very shiny turd is still a turd,1354665600,"12 5,

I am impressed with the story, the cinematography, the characters, the costume design, the sets, the spaceship designs, the alien designs, the CGI, and on and on. It seems like Ridley Scott successfully homaged his own ALIEN movie and at the same time successfully homaged 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. The first scenes of the robot/android prowling the ship and the crew waking up feels like a perfect blending of the 2 movies; no small feat. Noomi Rapace is my favorite actor from her role as Lisbeth, and here she plays Elizabeth, and it felt like the movie is her vehicle, she is the ultimate survivor, and her quest could easily become another trilogy. I will mention a few things that I liked, but that could have been even better ( I'm not complaining ): The main CREATOR aliens could have been less musclebound, and could have had female counterparts... I suspect there is more to this story. I liked the tentacled aliens, and they look and move superbly, and I liked that there were 3 or 4 different types in different stages, but it is a bit confusing and not completely coherent, but if this were reality we would not know what was going on anyway so it's ok, the 3 part storyline is not apparent at first viewing, so we are left wondering what does this mean and where are we now, but I caught on quickly enough. I am a little tired of tentacled aliens, but these are done so well and the action is so realistic and so interesting that I love it. the story basically is that a rich guy goes in search of the CREATORS, who look like musclebound albinos. The rich guy and his crew find them on another planet, they investigate, they all become infected with various aliens, Noomi survives, and with the robot she goes on in search of the CREATORS home world. Of course, it is all much more complicated than that. It is also superiorly beautiful. There are fantastic and beautiful special effects, all tasteful and very creative. The characters are good and beautiful to look at. I think there is even an homage to Lisbeth Salander in the movie. And even the character of Elizabeth seems like a continuation of Lisbeth's life, and I am very satisfied with it all.

1476094,A3TD7HLTDWZ382,B005LAIHXQ,"Pikminfan ""bobsworld3""","[7, 15]","I was a little worried when I walked into the theater to see ""Prometheus"".  The stakes were high.  I'm an enormous fan of the Alien film series and the original is still my favorite (only by a narrow margin with the second though).  ""Alien"" was a Ridley Scott masterpiece.  It was dark, it was suspenseful, it was immersive, it was terrifying and launched one Ellen Ripley into the stuff of cinematic legend.  What would this new film, this mysterious ""pseudo"" prequel to Alien be like?  I had heard very mixed reviews and even outright thrashings of the movie.  Ridley Scott himself was reluctant to call it a true prequel and was very cryptic about what it was.  My hopes were firmly in check as I entered the theater.  Even if the reviews were bad, I still thought maybe there was hope.  Afterall, a lot of people hated ""Alien Resurrection""-and I thought that was a great film.  (I even enjoy the AVP movies on some level-even if they aren't ""real"" Alien movies.  I hope that doesn't destroy my credibility here)  :)I'm pleased to say that both myself and the buddy I was with LOVED Prometheus.  That being said, it was not at all what I expected.  Instead, it was something entirely unique.  In short, ""Prometheus"" was this strange new thing I discovered unlike any other film I have ever seen.  It was bold, it was gorgeous, it was thought provoking and it dared the audience to invest in it's odd mythos.  Plus, I never knew where the next crazy turn would take me.  There was just no way to predict what curveball would come next.  Hours, even days later after viewing it-I was still thinking back on it, trying to put pieces of it together, thinking about all of the elements and how the chain of circumstances came together to create the end result.  In today's age of disposable entertainment, where films are so easily forgettable the second the end credits roll-I found Prometheus to be a welcome disrupter to the flow.  It takes a special film for me to find myself repeatedly drawn back to it and drawn back to it I was.Prometheus is a haunting film.  Not just for the world that it creates and the bizarre events that unfold, but also for the intriguing and memorable characters it introduces (David anyone?) and for the stunning beauty of the film itself.  I did not see the film in 3D, but will probably see a follow up viewing in 3D because I'm curious about the possibilities of what the third dimension could add to the film.  Prometheus truly is the most beautifully shot film I have seen since.....well I can't even remember.  It's an absolute visual stunner on every level and easily the most immersive Science Fiction film I have seen since the original Alien.All of this being said, there were a few things I did not understand immediately following the film.  I will not go into them for fear of spoiling others, but the buddy I was with had a pretty strong theory on what the first few minutes of the film meant and also made a biblical correlation that I had missed completely.  (On both accounts I believe he was spot on).  The only major issue I had with Prometheus is a continuity problem with the original.  The way Prometheus ended did not line up for me.  In order for the Nostromo team to make their initial discovery in the original, events would have had to transpire a little differently than the way they did in Prometheus.  I don't quite understand that either since it seemed to me like like that particular plot hole would've been easy enough to fix.  I assume Ridley Scott knew what he was doing and I guess if you really want to get creative there are scenarios you could imagine where the two could possibly line up, but to me-it seemed like a gapping plot crater in an otherwise profound and thought provoking piece of Sci-Fi brilliance.  (Still loved the film though)  Prometheus is fairly open ended and even though I don't imagine there will be a sequel, I would absolutely love to see one made.  My hat's off to Ridley Scott and the writers for creating something so vastly unique.  That's really quite an accomplishment for a prequel (of sorts).",5,Beautiful and thought provoking,1339977600,"06 18, 2012",2012,4096,"['was', 'little', 'worried', 'when', 'walked', 'theater', 'see', 'Prometheus', 'stakes', 'were', 'high', ""'m"", 'enormous', 'fan', 'Alien', 'film', 'series', 'original', 'still', 'favorite', 'only', 'narrow', 'margin', 'second', 'though', 'Alien', 'was', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'masterpiece', 'was', 'dark', 'was', 'suspenseful', 'was', 'immersive', 'was', 'terrifying', 'launched', 'one', 'Ellen', 'Ripley', 'stuff', 'cinematic', 'legend', 'What', 'would', 'new', 'film', 'mysterious', 'pseudo', 'prequel', 'Alien', 'be', 'had', 'heard', 'very', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'even', 'outright', 'thrashings', 'movie', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'was', 'reluctant', 'call', 'true', 'prequel', 'was', 'very', 'cryptic', 'what', 'was', 'hopes', 'were', 'firmly', 'check', 'entered', 'theater', 'Even', 'reviews', 'were', 'bad', 'still', 'thought', 'maybe', 'was', 'hope', 'Afterall', 'lot', 'people', 'hated', 'Alien', 'Resurrection', '-and', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'film', 'even', 'enjoy', 'AVP', 'movies', 'level-even', 'are', ""n't"", 'real', 'Alien', 'movies', 'hope', ""n't"", 'destroy', 'credibility', 'here', ""'m"", 'pleased', 'say', 'buddy', 'was', 'LOVED', 'Prometheus', 'being', 'said', 'was', 'not', 'what', 'expected', 'Instead', 'was', 'something', 'entirely', 'unique', 'short', 'Prometheus', 'was', 'strange', 'new', 'thing', 'discovered', 'other', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'was', 'bold', 'was', 'gorgeous', 'was', 'thought', 'provoking', 'dared', 'audience', 'invest', 'odd', 'mythos', 'never', 'knew', 'where', 'next', 'crazy', 'turn', 'would', 'take', 'was', 'just', 'way', 'predict', 'what', 'curveball', 'would', 'come', 'next', 'Hours', 'even', 'days', 'later', 'viewing', 'it-I', 'was', 'still', 'thinking', 'back', 'trying', 'put', 'pieces', 'together', 'thinking', 'elements', 'how', 'chain', 'circumstances', 'came', 'together', 'create', 'end', 'result', 'today', 'age', 'disposable', 'entertainment', 'where', 'films', 'are', 'so', 'easily', 'forgettable', 'second', 'end', 'roll-I', 'found', 'Prometheus', 'be', 'welcome', 'disrupter', 'flow', 'special', 'film', 'find', 'repeatedly', 'drawn', 'back', 'drawn', 'back', 'was.Prometheus', 'haunting', 'film', 'Not', 'just', 'world', 'bizarre', 'events', 'unfold', 'also', 'intriguing', 'memorable', 'characters', 'David', 'anyone', 'stunning', 'beauty', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'film', '3D', 'will', 'probably', 'see', 'follow', 'up', 'viewing', '3D', ""'m"", 'curious', 'possibilities', 'what', 'third', 'dimension', 'could', 'add', 'film', 'Prometheus', 'truly', 'most', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'film', 'have', 'seen', '..well', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'remember', 'absolute', 'visual', 'stunner', 'level', 'easily', 'most', 'immersive', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'original', 'Alien.All', 'being', 'said', 'were', 'few', 'things', 'did', 'not', 'understand', 'immediately', 'following', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'go', 'fear', 'spoiling', 'others', 'buddy', 'was', 'had', 'pretty', 'strong', 'theory', 'what', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'film', 'meant', 'also', 'made', 'biblical', 'correlation', 'had', 'missed', 'completely', 'accounts', 'believe', 'was', 'spot', 'only', 'major', 'issue', 'had', 'Prometheus', 'continuity', 'problem', 'original', 'way', 'Prometheus', 'ended', 'did', 'not', 'line', 'up', 'order', 'Nostromo', 'team', 'make', 'initial', 'discovery', 'original', 'events', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'transpire', 'little', 'differently', 'way', 'did', 'Prometheus', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'understand', 'seemed', 'particular', 'plot', 'hole', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'easy', 'enough', 'fix', 'assume', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'guess', 'really', 'want', 'get', 'creative', 'are', 'scenarios', 'could', 'imagine', 'where', 'two', 'could', 'possibly', 'line', 'up', 'me-it', 'seemed', 'gapping', 'plot', 'crater', 'otherwise', 'profound', 'thought', 'provoking', 'piece', 'Sci-Fi', 'brilliance', 'Still', 'loved', 'film', 'Prometheus', 'fairly', 'open', 'ended', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'will', 'be', 'sequel', 'would', 'absolutely', 'love', 'see', 'one', 'made', 'hat', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'writers', 'creating', 'something', 'so', 'vastly', 'unique', 'really', 'quite', 'accomplishment', 'prequel', 'sorts']",N/A

Heck, I even kinda liked Alien 3(Alien 4 is a joke)...but this was a poorly written film.  Visually it looks pretty and the CGI stuff is generally good(it should be, the movie cost over 100 million to make), but as we all know pretty effects can't carry a movie.  This is supposed to be a prequel to Alien but in many ways it isn't.  Most of you will be left scratching your heads as to where in time this is supposed to take place.  Are they on the same planet that the first crew landed on in the first Alien?  In that movie the alien craft had thousands of eggs presumably carrying the face huggers.  In this film the ship had these canisters containing some form of contaminant or other.  It's never really explained.  Much isn't clear in this mess.  Here we have snake like things then an octopoid thing.  What are they? Dunno.  What made the original Alien so cool was the humans stumbling on a planetoid where a derelict craft had crashed, piloted by some unknown species.  In Prometheus that idea is being killed by somehow bringing humans into the mix by saying that that unknown species is really our creators.  That is that they are genetically linked to us thus taking the exotic feel of Alien 1 out of the equation.  To me that is a cop-out bit of writing and whoever green-lighted the idea is an idiot.

The filmmakers did a splendid job with the parallax (3D layers) in most scenes, but don't search for pop out of the screen moments, as this isn't designed as such. Depth reaches far into the screen as would be expected with any 3D film.The 3rd dimension surely gives this horror/sci fi film an extra layer of dimension, transporting you into the exploration of these scientists searching for the origin of the human species, as they so grimly discover. The plethora of gory horror moments are as real as they can get thanks to the well implemented and very effective 3D.Does the 3D look as good as Avatar 3D? No, but it's a very pleasant 3D experience for sure, and a few good notches above most average quality 3D movies. There are scenes that really highlight the 3D, and most of the film conveys impressive 3D layers.For the movie itself, if you enjoyed the original Alien, there is no reason you won't enjoy this patient but tense horror/sci fi film, fairly reminiscent of the original nightmare discovery of Weaver's crew in many aspects.3D: Strong 3D throughout.3D Parallax: Nicely done.3D Depth: Good depth.3D Pop Outs: Few if any to remember.Overall 3D: 9/10.Thoroughly enjoyed the movie and the 3D.

There seemed to be many subplots, themes. Who or what is the Prometheus, Zeus overcoming his father Cronus, the Kings who do not wish to relinquish their power, the created who loose their need for their creators, and the creators fearing the growing power of the created so that when they awaken and achieve their freedom it is time to cripple them. The Cycles of Life turn. The only apparent connection between this film and Alien is the bioweapon and the race of beings that created them, and perhaps the same purpose for those bioweapons, the destruction or enslavement of the human race on earth.

1476119,AO9IRDRYPU9A6,B005LAIHXQ,"Rare Book Collector ""RBC""","[7, 12]","I attended the opening night of Prometheus at an IMAX 3D theater. The movie will undoubtedly receive Academy Award nominations in all categories. The IMAX 3D presentation was the finest use of IMAX 3D technology that I have ever experienced. The 3D was so excellent that it was literally like sitting in the middle of the action! The filmmakers know how to manipulate 3D and make it look good! I get a tingling sensation even thinking about it! That is why I pre-ordered Prometheus in the Blu-ray 3D/ Blu-ray/ DVD/ Digital Copy version without hesitation. This will become a treasured work of timeless cinematic art in my movie collection.Beyond the existential components of this film, Prometheus is a true prequel that fully explains the Alien Anthology (also out in Blu-ray and part of my collection). You will understand how it all began, and if you view the 2003 alternate endings for the films up to the finale, Alien Resurrection (the final movie of the Alien saga) replaced with a ""feel good ending"" in theaters, you will understand WHY that ultimate ending was inevitable. Although the Alien saga is a dark journey into the depths of hell, so to speak -- in essence an anthology of humanity's evolution through extinction and rebirth into a new quasi-human species over the course of centuries -- it is existentially worth the dark journey. How would YOU like to have acid for blood?I found many epiphanies about this universe and our existence as its intelligent observers. Perhaps parallel universes are God's proving grounds for intelligent life to decide if they truly want the burden and anguish of becoming ""like"" God, ""knowing good and bad""? Atheists, theists and agnostics will each find a different interpretation, no doubt, because it is debatable as to the true implications of Prometheus and the Alien movies that chronologically follow.However, theists will find solace in the unstoppable faith of Dr. Shaw. Perhaps one epiphany and take away from Prometheus is life may exist beyond this tiny blue planet -- the ancient holy texts may be allegories and not literal. Dr. Shaw believed God still exists and shall receive her beyond the great veil of reality when her temporal life ends. When her tests are over, however long that takes, God will deliver her from this great void. Atheists can pay no mind to these implications because Prometheus offers plenty of grist for the mill to argue that Shaw's faith is noble at best. That is the beauty of this film. Prometheus challenges both sides to think carefully about any preconceived fanciful illusions about God's existence as allegorically taught by the Church, or as dogmatically denied by hardcore nihilists.",5,Spectacular Film with Brilliant IMAX 3D Execution!,1342742400,"07 20, 2012",2012,2684,"['attended', 'opening', 'night', 'Prometheus', 'IMAX', '3D', 'theater', 'movie', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'receive', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominations', 'categories', 'IMAX', '3D', 'presentation', 'was', 'finest', 'use', 'IMAX', '3D', 'technology', 'have', 'ever', 'experienced', '3D', 'was', 'so', 'excellent', 'was', 'literally', 'like', 'sitting', 'middle', 'action', 'filmmakers', 'know', 'how', 'manipulate', '3D', 'make', 'look', 'good', 'get', 'tingling', 'sensation', 'even', 'thinking', 'why', 'pre-ordered', 'Prometheus', 'Blu-ray', '3D/', 'Blu-ray/', 'DVD/', 'Digital', 'Copy', 'version', 'hesitation', 'will', 'become', 'treasured', 'work', 'timeless', 'cinematic', 'art', 'movie', 'collection.Beyond', 'existential', 'components', 'film', 'Prometheus', 'true', 'prequel', 'fully', 'Alien', 'Anthology', 'also', 'out', 'Blu-ray', 'part', 'collection', 'will', 'understand', 'how', 'began', 'view', '2003', 'alternate', 'endings', 'films', 'up', 'finale', 'Alien', 'Resurrection', 'final', 'movie', 'Alien', 'saga', 'replaced', 'feel', 'good', 'ending', 'theaters', 'will', 'understand', 'WHY', 'ultimate', 'ending', 'was', 'inevitable', 'Alien', 'saga', 'dark', 'journey', 'depths', 'hell', 'so', 'speak', 'essence', 'anthology', 'humanity', 'evolution', 'extinction', 'rebirth', 'new', 'quasi-human', 'species', 'course', 'centuries', 'existentially', 'worth', 'dark', 'journey', 'How', 'would', 'YOU', 'have', 'acid', 'blood', 'found', 'many', 'epiphanies', 'universe', 'existence', 'intelligent', 'observers', 'Perhaps', 'parallel', 'universes', 'are', 'God', 'proving', 'grounds', 'intelligent', 'life', 'decide', 'truly', 'want', 'burden', 'anguish', 'becoming', 'God', 'knowing', 'good', 'bad', 'Atheists', 'theists', 'agnostics', 'will', 'find', 'different', 'interpretation', 'doubt', 'debatable', 'true', 'implications', 'Prometheus', 'Alien', 'movies', 'chronologically', 'follow.However', 'theists', 'will', 'find', 'solace', 'unstoppable', 'faith', 'Dr.', 'Shaw', 'Perhaps', 'one', 'epiphany', 'take', 'away', 'Prometheus', 'life', 'may', 'exist', 'tiny', 'blue', 'planet', 'ancient', 'holy', 'texts', 'may', 'be', 'allegories', 'not', 'literal', 'Dr.', 'Shaw', 'believed', 'God', 'still', 'shall', 'receive', 'great', 'veil', 'reality', 'when', 'temporal', 'life', 'ends', 'When', 'tests', 'are', 'however', 'long', 'God', 'will', 'deliver', 'great', 'void', 'Atheists', 'can', 'pay', 'mind', 'implications', 'Prometheus', 'plenty', 'grist', 'mill', 'argue', 'Shaw', 'faith', 'noble', 'best', 'beauty', 'film', 'Prometheus', 'sides', 'think', 'carefully', 'preconceived', 'fanciful', 'illusions', 'God', 'existence', 'allegorically', 'taught', 'Church', 'dogmatically', 'denied', 'hardcore', 'nihilists']",N/A

I have to say from the time the movie started till the very end, I never found a dull moment to be honest!  I think alot of people were expecting this film to be similar to Aliens, with tons of aliens raging about killing people.  I really didn't want to see another similar flick like that, instead I very much appreciated this one, it was rather refreshing to say the least! I know not everyone agrees but it all boils down to our expectations of a film and how we perceive it!As far as the special edition 2D bluray is concerned, I did have a problem with mines when it started to break up in blocks around 1 hour 28 minutes into the movie. Then the problem got worse and the picture became all fuzzy and froze. I couldn't operate the remote or power it off, so I had to unplug the player from the outlet, power it back on and eject the disc.  I have read on avsforum.com that certain batches of this bluray dvd have the same problem.  I decided to load the regular dvd and continued watching from that point onwards with no issues at all.I must say despite the problem I encountered with my bluray disc, I will still rate the picture quality as 10/10, and the sound is fantastic as well...10/10. I never had to adjust my volume control like I have had to on some other movies when it came to the dialogue and action.Here's an update for October 14 @ 3:30 P.M.Ok! There is a solution I've found for those defective discs! Ofcourse you have all read my dilemma with the bluray disc but here is what I did and it worked flawlessly.Go to the player's own menu. Go: Setup > BD / DVD Viewing Settings > BD Internet Connection > Do Not Allow or Disable.You will need to turn it back on after you're through watching the film for your other applications if need be.

The movie was visually fantastic. For sure you see they wanted you to know that this was set in the Alien universe, but don't go in expecting Alien. I think Ridley Scott and Co. were better off not mentioning Alien at all. This would've quelled the criticism the movie got because now people have an expectation that may not have been intended. If people weren't given hints of the connection, it would've given a surprise that was unexpected but also more open minds looking at this as it's own thing.

Most of the crew is male and only two (out of three) females have important and significant presence.  One of them is Meredith Vickers played by Charlize Theron.  An ice woman, beautiful but unapprochable who from the start makes it clear for the entire crew that ""her job is to ensure that everyone on the mission does their job"".  In other worlds, Meredith is an ultimate project manager.  Her decisions are made rationally, she does not expect to be anyone's friend (even her living quarters have special accommodations) and she is shrewd - she makes sure that everyone understands that they are employees and nothing else.Everything else in this film is so ""Hollywood Formula"" style that it is not worth writing about.

It's very pretty looking2. It's better than the Phantom MenaceSeriously. People keep comparing this to The Phantom Menace, and that's so unfair. It's easily better. For one it's prettier and there's some nice creepy characters. But ultimately, Prometheus is a movie so bad that I can only recommend it to people the same way I recommend The Phantom Menace: not at all.Before people tell me I didn't get this movie or I didn't grow up in the time the Alien was released: I actually grew up with these movies in my video collection. I like Alien, Aliens and Alien 3, but Alien Ressurection disappointed me greatly. And let's not even get started on those horrid Alien Vs. Predator movies- those movies are just plain insulting to both franchises. And sadly, so is Prometheus. Oh, and I got it just perfectly. It's too bad the film is just a steaming pile of crap, though.One thing I could imagine was that Ridley must have overheard his 5 year old grandson telling a friend a story when coming up with the idea for the film. Seriously. ""And then a robot can see people's memories, and then they go to a planet, and there's a cave with all these coccoons, and then they find a head, then they bring it back to their ship, then they revive it, then it explodes, and then the robot puts alien blood in a guy's drink, and then the woman scientist has a baby in her tummy, and then she removes it from her stomach but it's not really a baby but an alien and then the guy turns into an alien, then they go to a cave, and then they meet a bald guy, and then the robot gets his head torn off, then the woman goes back to the ship, and then the alien from her tummy didn't die there and fights the bald guy that followed her..."" seriously. As Peter Griffin says, ""There, I just saved you two long and boobless hours!""In addition to such a ludicrous plot, There's also hideously bad acting- I typically love Noomi Rapace but she was abysmal. Not her fault, she is a Swede, so why make her a Brit? Charlize was just boring to watch and spoke all her lines in a similar fashion to Kristen Stewart. Shaw's boyfriend was bad too, and the only good performance was from Michael Fassbender. I felt sorry for him, watching him be the one good actor in a film riddled with bad performances.Then there's the dialogue. Dear lord. I swear for 10 minutes the dialogue consided of ""Prometheus are you seeing this? Prometheus did you catch the image I just saw? Prometheus are you still following us?"" I swear if I heard the word ""Prometheus"" one more time I was going to walk out of the cinema. And that horrid ""I am your father"" moment... UGH.Just avoid this film at all cost.

1476146,A2SSKER1T8047B,B005LAIHXQ,Riaan,"[60, 81]","*** WAY TOO MANY SPOILERS***Visually, Prometheus is a stunner. The CGI and photography look fantastic; you get your money's worth in that regard.  The same can't be said for the script and characters, which are dumber than a bucket of dirt! Here's why:1. Peter Weyland, who funds the expedition, appears at the beginning of the film via recorded video, introduces himself to the crew and reveals that, by the time they see this, he would be dead. Near the end of the film, he re-appears, but in human form. In the ship. Right there. In the ship. The question arises: Why the hell would Weyland appear to be dead, hide in his own bloody ship - HIS OWN SHIP!! - then casually re-appear an hour or so later in the movie to ask the Engineers to prevent his death from old age?2. Before heading out on their mission, Shaw informs Jackson, expedition SECURITY, that this is a scientific expedition and that no weapons are allowed. Why was Jackson included for the mission then? If he's not allowed to carry weapons, how will he defend the team in case real trouble arises on an alien planet on which no humans have ever set foot? What's he going to use? Karate? The Judo chop?3. Fifield's tantrum upon finding the first dead alien. Why would Weyland choose a wimpy geologist - who just ""loves rocks"" - for an enormously expensive and potentially dangerous expedition to an alien planet gazillion miles from earth?  Surely the suitable candidate for such a mission should be robust and prepared for any sort of emergency, including finding dead weird stuff he's never seen before! But instead, Fifield scampers off back to the ship, taking scared-stiff biologist Millburn along with him! Where did Weyland find these wimps?4. Why is David, the programmed and therefore supposedly obedient and smart android so ill-disciplined? He opens alien doors without asking permission (""oops, sorry""), he touches the stone cylinders without thinking (""sorry""), he inexplicably and intentionally poisons Holloway with the black liquid (not sorry, I presume). Why doesn't he test the stuff in a lab first? He's android gone wild! And yet, towards the end he helpfully and sincerely assists Shaw to find another ship! How touching. Aw[...]5. Before the storm arrives, why do Millburn and Fifield wander around aimlessly in the caves? They're lost, see. And they're smart, too. They're scientists. Why then, don't they ask help from Prometheus who could EASILY guide them back to the ship via the mapping system which, only recently, had mapped out the entire cave?!6. Fifield and Millburn are scared of dead aliens. Apparently, Millburn is not scared of live alien snakes. What does he do when he's confronted by a threatening alien snake? He pets it of course. Fifield just stands by. And watches. Why not? Makes perfect sense. The snake then kills Millburn. Even better.7. With the help of a medicinal apparatus, Shaw performs abdominal surgery on herself to remove an alien host - a squid.  Shortly after, she stumbles into a room filled with crew members. Nobody notices her exposed stomach with surgery staples the size of door handles. Nobody bothers to ask her: ""Excuse me, but WTF happened to you?"" Nobody. Amazing huh? What's more remarkable is that a mere few hours later she dashes around like an Olympic athlete, trying to get away from a ship, completely pain-free and mobile. Oh yes.8. Why doesn't Holloway raise the alarm when he realizes he's infected by some weird bug that's crawling around in his eye? You know, have it looked at in the lab by his fellow SCIENTISTS? Seems like the smart thing to do, right? No. The smart thing would be to not tell a soul and become so ill that you REQUEST to be doused with fire and die a horrible, painful death. But of course!9. Why does Shaw, who remains a professional for the most part of the film, suddenly act like a petulant child towards the end when the group and Weyland confront the Engineer? Why yell and scream like an irritable toddler at the Engineer? Doesn't make one bit of sense.10. Shaw convinces Janek to ram himself, his two pilots and all of Prometheus into the Engineer's craft. It takes her only a few seconds to persuade three other human beings to give up their lives by turning their spacecraft into a giant fireball. And they happily oblige. Just like that. No questions. No discussions. Really? REALLY?!?!?!11. When Shaw and Vickers run from the falling alien spacecraft, why do they run in a straight line? It's obvious to everyone and their mother that, if you just turn right or left, just by a few meters, that you'll avoid the craft and save your life. But noooooooo. Eventually Shaw realizes this. Not Vickers. Turns out she's not only a bitch, but a stupid one, too.See? If you break it down, this movie is just unbelievably f***ing stupid. Roger Ebert awarded this film four stars. Ironic, since he's always been an ardent crusader for films with intelligent scripts and characters.  Strangely, I do recommend this film. Grab your popcorn and soda, but DON'T switch your brain on.

1476148,A3LGT6UZL99IW1,B005LAIHXQ,"Richard C. Drew ""Anaal Nathra/Uthe vas Bethod...","[8, 14]","The movie has been reviewed to death. Nothing much I can add there - except that some parts will really make you squirm!  The quality is flawless, the effects mind-blowing, the ancestral/nascent versions of the Face Huggers and Aliens is friggin great.So I'll review the product.  Movie: 5 stars. Digital extras, etc. - 0 stars. The digital download options are horrible. You can pick the new ""Untraviolet"" option - this requires that you join one of two streaming video services. It's 10 minutes of jumping through hoops, answering questions, entering the same code multiple times and verifying email accounts. You can't simply copy and play.The other option is using iTunes to copy the movie. What if I don't have iTunes or don't want to use iTunes?  So I went to my old computer that did have iTunes. It won't accept the code. It gives an error that the movie must be redeemed using the DVD. The DVD runs a program that simply opens iTunes and instructs you to manually enter the code. The end result - no digital copy on iTunes. After six tries it finally worked. The program was not loading iTunes correctly. Want to watch it on your Droid tablet? Forget it - unless you want to stream the Ultraviolet version. I don't want to waste my battery powering WiFi when I don't need it.  But I can't copy the digital version to my tablet. So much for watching it ""anytime, anywhere.""While that's going on, I decided to scan the QR code on the insert ""to learn more.""  Too bad it can't be scanned. Droid X phone, Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 tablet, iPhone4 and iPad2 - none of these could scan the QR code. I guess the designers never bothered to test it.So I figured I'd try the app. What an irritating, frustrating little program this is. It just screams ""DELETE ME!"" Slow, clunky, half the options just give an error that it has to be synced to the movie to work - and even then they don't.This disc was obviously designed to push Blu-Ray to it's limits. Interactivity, menus - you name it. The problem is that they pushed it too far, to the point that unless you have a top-end player, the entire system fails miserably. For example - In the main menu, I could not navigate to any option except ""Play"" unless I powered down the player, powered up again, and immediately selected a different menu option, such as ""Extras"". If I played the movie first, then went back, it locked.  As for the ""Easter eggs"" - forget it. Could not get one to work. Locked up or did nothing.The deleted scenes - not too many. A couple were interesting, and you could tell that they could have played the characters a couple of different ways.  ""Alternate ending"" - could not get it to work, and that's assuming I even found the correct menu option. Again, the power-cycling between options was frustrating.So if you want a great movie on a fantastic format - and don't care about the digital copies or app, then you'll be thrilled.  Expect anything else to work? Forget it.Final insult: I have three Blu-Ray players. All three have the most current firmware. The DVD will only play on one of them. Won't play in my Samsung or Sony, but it will play in my Sanyo. But it takes forever to load, and sounds like an old computer floppy disk on and off for a minute - The rattly sound when it loads data and the machine-gun staccato when it resets.One final comment. They used the cheapest possible case for this product. It offers almost no protection, and is way too flexible. The DVD cases were great - this is not much better than paper. As for printed extras - just the insert with the redeemable code.",3,"Fantstic movie, terrible system for digital copies - They pushed the envelope for Blu-Ray features too far.",1349740800,"10 9, 2012",2012,3573,"['movie', 'been', 'reviewed', 'death', 'Nothing', 'much', 'can', 'add', 'parts', 'will', 'really', 'make', 'squirm', 'quality', 'flawless', 'effects', 'mind-blowing', 'ancestral/nascent', 'versions', 'Face', 'Huggers', 'Aliens', 'friggin', 'great.So', ""'ll"", 'review', 'product', 'Movie', '5', 'stars', 'Digital', 'extras', 'etc', '0', 'stars', 'digital', 'download', 'options', 'are', 'horrible', 'can', 'pick', 'new', 'Untraviolet', 'option', 'join', 'one', 'two', 'streaming', 'video', 'services', '10', 'minutes', 'jumping', 'hoops', 'answering', 'questions', 'entering', 'same', 'code', 'multiple', 'times', 'verifying', 'email', 'accounts', 'ca', ""n't"", 'simply', 'copy', 'play.The', 'other', 'option', 'using', 'iTunes', 'copy', 'movie', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'iTunes', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'use', 'iTunes', 'So', 'went', 'old', 'computer', 'did', 'have', 'iTunes', 'wo', ""n't"", 'accept', 'code', 'error', 'movie', 'must', 'be', 'redeemed', 'using', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'program', 'simply', 'iTunes', 'instructs', 'manually', 'enter', 'code', 'end', 'result', 'digital', 'copy', 'iTunes', 'six', 'tries', 'finally', 'worked', 'program', 'was', 'not', 'loading', 'iTunes', 'correctly', 'Want', 'watch', 'Droid', 'tablet', 'Forget', 'want', 'stream', 'Ultraviolet', 'version', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'waste', 'battery', 'powering', 'WiFi', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'ca', ""n't"", 'copy', 'digital', 'version', 'tablet', 'So', 'much', 'watching', 'anytime', 'anywhere', 'going', 'decided', 'scan', 'QR', 'code', 'insert', 'learn', 'more', 'bad', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'scanned', 'Droid', 'X', 'phone', 'Samsung', 'Galaxy', 'Tab', '2', 'tablet', 'iPhone4', 'iPad2', 'none', 'could', 'scan', 'QR', 'code', 'guess', 'designers', 'never', 'bothered', 'test', 'it.So', 'figured', ""'d"", 'try', 'app', 'What', 'irritating', 'frustrating', 'little', 'program', 'just', 'DELETE', 'ME', 'Slow', 'clunky', 'options', 'just', 'give', 'error', 'be', 'synced', 'movie', 'work', 'even', 'then', ""don't.This"", 'disc', 'was', 'obviously', 'designed', 'push', 'Blu-Ray', 'limits', 'Interactivity', 'menus', 'name', 'problem', 'pushed', 'too', 'far', 'point', 'have', 'top-end', 'player', 'entire', 'system', 'miserably', 'example', 'main', 'menu', 'could', 'not', 'navigate', 'option', 'Play', 'powered', 'down', 'player', 'powered', 'up', 'again', 'immediately', 'selected', 'different', 'menu', 'option', 'such', 'Extras', 'played', 'movie', 'first', 'then', 'went', 'back', 'locked', 'Easter', 'eggs', 'forget', 'Could', 'not', 'get', 'one', 'work', 'Locked', 'up', 'did', 'nothing.The', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'not', 'too', 'many', 'couple', 'were', 'interesting', 'could', 'tell', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'characters', 'couple', 'different', 'ways', 'Alternate', 'ending', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'work', 'assuming', 'even', 'found', 'correct', 'menu', 'option', 'Again', 'power-cycling', 'options', 'was', 'frustrating.So', 'want', 'great', 'movie', 'fantastic', 'format', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'digital', 'copies', 'app', 'then', ""'ll"", 'be', 'thrilled', 'Expect', 'anything', 'else', 'work', 'Forget', 'it.Final', 'insult', 'have', 'three', 'Blu-Ray', 'players', 'three', 'have', 'most', 'current', 'firmware', 'DVD', 'will', 'only', 'play', 'one', 'Wo', ""n't"", 'play', 'Samsung', 'Sony', 'will', 'play', 'Sanyo', 'forever', 'load', 'old', 'computer', 'floppy', 'disk', 'minute', 'rattly', 'sound', 'when', 'data', 'machine-gun', 'staccato', 'when', 'resets.One', 'final', 'comment', 'used', 'cheapest', 'possible', 'case', 'product', 'almost', 'protection', 'way', 'too', 'flexible', 'DVD', 'cases', 'were', 'great', 'not', 'much', 'better', 'paper', 'printed', 'extras', 'just', 'insert', 'redeemable', 'code']",N/A

I didn't know what to expect when I saw this movie but I will say now that I loved it and I think it is just what the franchise needs to save it from the ridiculous Alien: Erection film and the AvP films (although the predator/alien fight scene in AvP 1 was pretty bad @$$)!They did a much better job on choosing actors this time compared to the above mentioned films in the series and I think Noomi Rapace was a great choice for the main.  Like the other reviewers have said, they do some stupid things sometimes...like wanting to pet what looks like some kind of a lethal alien snake, but overall, they're good!It has a controversial plot.  I loved it!  But I think it will anger the atheist crowd somewhat as the main actor still believes in God nearly 100 years from now.  This shouldn't be a reason to give the movie a 1 star rating.  And it may anger the Christians a bit by saying an alien race created us (I'm a bit of a spiritual agnostic/ancient astronaut theory kinda guy myself).The special effects are bad @$$!

There are a few things I had issues with, but overall an entertaining film that is better by quite a bit compared to Aliens 3 and 4, though not as good as II or the masterpiece first film.The plotline is posted in wikipedia if you want to know what happens, but basically they find evidence of alien life through archeological digs in ~2080.  They convince a really old guy to build a starship to go to this world and find it.The biggest issue I had with the film was similar to what I had with no. 2.  The crew of the ship is a bunch of misfits.  This old guy spends 1 trillion bucks to put this thing together, and he gets a bunch of hard drinking, mohawk wearing wackos to be his crew.  Similar to the marines in no. 2 - as if they found the flunkies from basic training instead of elite professionals to be the choice team to send on some multi-gazillion dollar mission.They get on the planet.. take off their helmets, and black goo from X files starts leaking all over the floor.  Gee... whats that?  Dead alien bodies everywhere... hmmmm... the air SMELLS good...Yadda yadda people die and turn into genetically modified monsters.. more people die and things start exploding.They also have the philosophical undertones of why are we here?  What is our purpose?  But at the end of the film it didn't seem to matter all that much.  The focal point was scary aliens and black goo and people splatting all over the screen.And thats why I give it four stars.  There are some good scenes with the engineers (the humanoid aliens) and the black goo.  The lead is pretty good and some of the rest of the characters (especially david - very well done by Fesbender) do a good job.  And overall when I walked out of the theater I was glad I saw it.

""Ginger Vitus""","[0, 1]","... and on a sliding scale of all the ""Alien"" films, a solid ""A"".Since my opinion of this film is favorable, I read many of the low-star reviews posted on Amazon.com to get a sense of what the complaints were among those who were less than impressed.I agree with the nay-sayers that the viewer must overlook stereotypical characterizations and the outright illogical - if not stupid - decisions the crew of the Prometheus make over the course of this movie. However, some of those same critical observations can also be directed at ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""Star Wars"", or even 1979's ""Alien"", all considered by most to be worthwhile movies, if not sci-fi classics. And much of what made those films great is what makes ""Prometheus"" rate my four stars... it is visually spectacular and terrifying.""Prometheus"" returns to the dark, Geiger-esque set design that made the original so appealing and it surprises viewers with extra-terrestrials not seen in the earlier offerings. The plot, though often predictable, revolves around seeking the origin of humans as a species and man's quest for eternal life. This ""Alien"" prequel takes place in the not-too-distant future, from 2089 on planet Earth until New Year's Day, 2094, on LV-223, the moon of a distant planet. The effects and cinematography are superb. And director Ridley Scott once again succeeds in making the viewer feel the fear and isolation of the hostile environment experienced by the crew of the scientific vessel. In the movie ""Alien"", the tag line was ""In space, no one can hear you scream."" That line is still appropriate in ""Prometheus"".If I had to point out weak points of this film, it would be the dialogue and sound. I initially saw Prometheus at the theater, which is where it was intended to be viewed. Obviously you lose much in the transfer to the smaller screen. However, because of the sometimes pressured dialogue, I gained more from the movie plot-wise after watching it again on DVD (it doesn't hurt to have the closed caption feature on or the remote close by). If you can get past this, the rest should be a breeze.If you are an uber-critic of films you will definitely be disappointed. To the perfectionist viewer, ""Prometheus"" will be easy to pick apart. And no one will will be nominated for an Oscar here (althought there are good performances, especially and not surprisingly from Charlize Theron). As far as the same old, same old is concerned, there are the traditional creatures from the 1979 film, as well as a Ripley-like heroine, an android, a cavernous spacecraft, a corporate CEO heavy, and the oft-repeated stereotypical crew of both the good and the not so good. However, the movie is not silly or ridiculous and the suspense goes a long way in covering up most mistakes. The mapping ""pups"" are very cool, as are the new ET's. Especially impressive to me was the 5 minute or so lead-up to the opening title.Since I've yet to see the perfect film and in spite it's flaws, ""Prometheus"" has earned my praise and recommendation. It is a fun film, not a documentary. It is meant to be entertaining, not informative.

Additionally, the twists of plot were not sufficiently strong enough to meet expectations. Finally, this was the time to tie up loose ends, answer questions from the predecessor movies. It didn't even attempt to answer it's own questions and indeed seemed more intent on bashing Christians for their faith than horrifying movie goers.Lots of great computer graphics, yes, but this is a Sci-Fi HORROR movie and frankly I never jumped. It was NOT horrific. I have to hold Ridley Scott accountable because he clearly knows what works and what doesn't. Hollywood has got to separate itself from politics. At least they didn't bash or blame George Bush - something a lot of flicks still do to this day.The cast was fairly seasoned, yet the acting was more horrific than the ""horror scenes.""The scenes with the greatest potential for real horror seemed to be abbreviated. Showing me odd, gross, weird, disgusting things does not horror make. True horror makes one jump, maybe yell out an expletive, throw their popcorn barrel and/or turn away. The problem is this movies never drew me into the scenes like Alien and Aliens did. In those movies, I was right there with the crew, horrified, running, screaming; as the aliens moved in.How do you know when a movie isn't working? You find yourself checking email while the movie runs in the background.Was it worth $3.99 rental?  Yes. The novelty of it being the prequel to Alien makes it worth seeing...once. Would I own it? NO!The rental did include two bonus features at the end, after the credits --that was a nice extra.The best scenes were the opening scenes of Iceland and were probably worth the $3.99. Gorgeous land, that! Incredible.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thanks for reading my reviews.

Peter Weyland,Logan Marshall-Green as Charlie Holloway,and many others in this solid cast.The film opens as we float over a barren and desolate landscape.Standing on the edge of a precipice beside a Niagara like gorge,is a humanoid looking alien who drinks a strange black potion.As it courses through his body he literally falls to pieces and into the water,which reforms in it as new strands of DNA(ours?).Fast forward to 2089 and the Weyland Corporation has hired two archeologists to accompany one of their space ships to a distant galaxy/planet,which matches the grouping found in an ancient cave in some wall art.Of course this demands the use of cryogenic pods,as the distance takes over two years to reach.A lone android by the name of David,presides over the ships functions and reawakens everyone when the ship nears its destination.They enter the planet's atmosphere,which is covered in clouds.As they finally get close to ground the sky opens up,and as they search they spot a large long ""runway"" which leads to a larger dome like structure;obviously not natural.Part of the crew exits the ship and enters the dome.They have artificial round drones that start to automatically map the interior.It is a huge complex and the Android David,who has spent much of his alone time deconstructing a myriad of languages,scrolls and ancient texts,believes if they contact any life,he can more than likely communicate with them.They run across some strange symbols on the walls and in short order David is gaining access to the inaccessible.He first activates a hologram which has holographic images of giant humanoids running through the corridors.They follow them which leads them to a large door with one of the creatures actually dead in front of it(decapitated).David gains them access through the door and into a chamber with a large head at the back of it,human like in shape.Leading to it is an area filled with sleek short stubby topped tubes with something in a black liquid inside them.Around all of them are shallow trenches into which the excess liquid drains.The rest of the crew takes the disembodied head of the dead alien back to the ship,while David secretly takes back one of the tubes.Most of the crew make it back but two members stay behind because of a storm that comes up very quickly.David asks Charlie how far he would go to find out the truth of what is going on,and he answers as far as he would need to.They both drink a toast to that,but David has slipped a tiny portion of that alien black liquid into his drink.Back inside the dome the two men are roaming the room with the head and tubes.Suddenly a long thin neck with a bulb like head pops up from the liquid trench.At first the one thinks it cute until it latches onto him,envelopes his arm and eventually gets inside his suit and his mouth.The other man had tried to cut the creature off and got sprayed by its ""blood"",which ate through his helmet and he collapsed.The crew from the ship make it back to aide the two men,too late of course,but by now Charlie has become seriously ill.By the time they make it back to the ship ,he is in real dire straights and looks terrible.The ships head,Ms.Vickers,over rules everyone and won't allow him to contaminate the ship and carries a flame thrower to back herself up with.Charlie asks her to go ahead and incinerate him and she indeed does,as his girlfriend Elizabeth screams in agony.It is around this time we learn that company founder/owner Mr Weyland is alive and on board.He is dying but is anxious to see if the alien on board,what they now have determined is an actual alien ship,can help him cure the disease he has.David had discovered(on his own of course)the ship control room and an actual alien pilot in stasis there.In the meantime Ms.Shaw has learned she is three months pregnant by her late boyfriend Charlie,whom she had relations just a day before.David refuses to tell her what the fetus looks like so she takes it upon herself to have it surgically removed by an on board medical machine,after David refuses to perform the procedure.What comes out is a small snake like creature which is held in the tube after she leaves it.Shaw accompanies Mr Weyland,David and others over to the alien ship's control room where they awaken the alien.He is not a happy camper and sets about killing as many as he can before the rest flee,and then starts up his craft.Shaw and Vickers flees the craft,warning that the alien ship must be stopped,because it is taking its payload to Earth,which will be infected and destroyed.As the huge alien ship lifts off,the captain of the Prometheus puts his ship on a collision course and brings his ship and the alien one back to the ground.The huge alien ship kills Vickers as it settles back on the ground and Shaw barely manages to live through it herself.She makes it back to the wreckage of the Prometheus but soon hears Davids voice over the intercom.His disembodied head is still lying on the floor of the alien control room and he warns Shaw the alien pilot is coming her way and looking for revenge.When he arrives they struggle near the sick bay where the creature taken out of Shaws belly has now grown into a huge tentacled monster.She opens the door and it grabs and envelopes the alien pilot,depositing its egg within its stomach.Shaw escapes to the alien ship and retrieves David's disembodied head and his body to take with her.David claims he can pilot another alien craft,of which there are others on the planet.To Davids surprise,she wants to find out where the aliens are from and wants to go there to seek answers.The film ends as a young alien(the type we are more used to seeing)bursts out of the dead alien pilot's chest,standing on its spindly legs and screeching.I recall Ridley Scott being so very coy in avoiding any comparison of Prometheus to the Alien movies before its initial release.But I think it safe to say that this is defintely part of the Alien franchise,a pre-quel if you will,and what a doozy.Like the first one it slowly but surely pulls you in and from then on you cannot help but be a ""prisoner"".The film begins with alot of questions and ends with as many.I like Scott's editing and pace.A fine example is the scene where David brings up the alien holographic schematic of our galaxy.The music rises in crescendo and it is a gorgeous moment of discovery(and visuals)by the character,and instead of lingering on and enjoying the moment to its fullest,the schematic suddenly ends(sooner than one would expect)and we're off once again.Scott had alot to tell and obviously didn't want to get bogged down in any one area too long,which enhances the entire dynamic.Along the way we are seeing hints and visual cues of the familiar,from the Alien cannon.The egg shaped cylinders in the ""head""room(not unlike the more rounder versions the later Queens laid),another android(David)which,if you know anything about the Alien franchise,you NEVER trust,the Weyland company name(pre Weyland-Yutani)and for a bonus Weyland himself,the alien head they found and took back to the ship,we first saw in the original Alien,which turns out to be a space helmet,the aliens themselves,their attacks in which they go for the mouth and their manor of incubation in the stomach,the alien ship as seen again in the first Alien,and on and on.It is obvious how much new ground there is to mine regarding the Alien franchise and this back story.The franchise has pretty much been run into the ground these past few years and I am so glad Ridley Scott came back triumphantly to tell and sell a new chapter in the Alien history book.It is intriguing and absorbing and I cannot wait until the next one.Just an aside,I would like to see an extended version(which I am sure exists and will be released sometime)of this movie.It would certainly flesh out more of what we saw.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r and is clear and crisp.There are no extras here.In conclusion Ridley Scott regains the Alien helm once more and breathes new life into this grounded franchise.The actors,the plot and the pace are all there.It's full of questions,some solved and others later posed.But you will eat it all up and be left wanting for more.Highly recommended.",4,4 - 4 1/2 stars -The Alien back story!,1351209600,"10

1476185,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B005LAIHXQ,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[4, 11]","&lt;strong>Prometheus&lt;/strong> (Ridley Scott, 2012)You know what? If &lt;em>Prometheus&lt;/em> had been directed by anyone other than Ridley Scott, or if it hadn't been marketed as an &lt;em>Alien&lt;/em> prequel--I am working on the hypothesis that it originally was not, and the &lt;em>Alien&lt;/em> elements were retrofitted either at the insistence of the studio or when Scott and Spaits/Lindelof realized how much there was in common there--we wouldn't be having any of the discussions we are currently having about this movie. We'd probably be pretty united in hailing it as one of the more inventive (if derivative), and certainly one of the most technically accomplished, science fiction movies in recent memory, probably the best sci-fi movie since &lt;em>Cube&lt;/em> almost fifteen years ago. From a technical standpoint, &lt;em>Prometheus&lt;/em> is unassailable; the acting is pitch-perfect, the direction is exactly what one would expect form the guy who brought you &lt;em>Gladiator&lt;/em> and &lt;em>Bladerunner&lt;/em>, every member of the crew brought his or her A game, the 3D is hands-down the best I've seen since &lt;em>Cave of Forgotten Dreams&lt;/em> (and is used much in the same way, to my delight). In short, this is the type of movie for which the word ""sumptuous"" was coined. Forget all that Merchant-Ivory boondoggle. (After all, what are sci-fi films if not period dramas for periods that haven't happened yet?) It is, in short, an impressive achievement by any empirical yardstick one would choose to measure it with.The problem is, of course, that it &lt;em>was&lt;/em> directed by Ridley Scott, and even if you hadn't caught all the in-jokes and references in the script before you hit the final sequence, well, when you get to that point there's no denying this is an &lt;em>Alien&lt;/em> movie. (And in a movie that seemed awfully retrofitted, that final sequence was the most garishly tacked-on bit. But I am getting ahead of myself.) Now, while I am a pretty darned big fan of the Alien series, or at least the first three movies (I still to this day have not gotten round to seeing &lt;em>Alien Resurrection&lt;/em>, despite pretty much everyone I know telling me how much better it is than &lt;em>Alien&lt;supr>3&lt;/supr>&lt;/em>, a movie I actually quite liked), and even the one guy in the room who actually enjoyed &lt;em>Alien vs. Predator&lt;/em> for the stupid fun fanboy movie it was, I'm still a casual fan of the series as opposed to a true &lt;em>otaku&lt;/em>. You kind of have to be, in order to enjoy the big stuff-blows-up stupidity of &lt;em>Alien vs. Predator&lt;/em> in any way.There's also another layer to this, and one that most people don't seem to have thought about, but that's come up a few times in my discussions on the movie since I saw it Friday night (I'm writing this on the following Monday afternoon); there's a meta layer that was absent from the other films. And perhaps I'm overstepping the bounds here, but it seems to me that Scott and co., and specifically Avy Kaufman, who cast Noomi Rapace as a character named Elizabeth (and in at least one place during an action scene, an actor slips up and calls her character Lisbet), pretty much invited this meta layer into the film. And it casts an interesting light on what has become one of the movie's big controversies. But again, I'm getting ahead of myself.NOTE: There is one thing revealed in the synopsis that I can't believe is a spoiler, though there is a scene in the film that leads me to believe it was meant that way. If you are especially spoiler-sensitive, you may want to skip over the synopsis.Plot: two sceintists, Elizabeth Shaw (Rapace, rocketed to fame through playing Lisbeth Salander in the Millennium trilogy) and Charlie Holloway (&lt;em>Devil&lt;/em>'s Logan Marshall-Green), uncover what would seem to be a star map in the cave paintings and stone carvings of half a dozen, maybe more, ancient civilizations. Thanks to new-and-improved 2089 technology, they pinpoint the exact star system those paintings depict.[Problem #1: 35,000+ years later, the positions of some of those stars will have changed; after a tenth of that, some of the Greek constellations have lost their original shapes to modern eyes.]So Weyland Technologies, headed up by the very, very old Peter Weyland (&lt;em>The Adventures of Priscilla&lt;/em>'s Guy Pearce, and I'd be tempted to ask him which film had the tougher make-up job) and his ice-queen daughter Meredith Vickers (&lt;em>Monster&lt;/em>'s Charlize Theron), send a ship out to this star system, which happens to contain one very earth-like moon revolving a Saturn-like planet. The ship contains seventeen crew members, including various scientists, navigators, Vickers as the Weyland Technologies representative, and an android named David (&lt;em>Shame&lt;/em>'s Michael Fassbender) who learns human mannerisms from watching old movies obsessively, but, as a hologram of Weyland reminds us during the mission briefing, has no soul. Holloway and Shaw believe this planet to be the home of a race they call the Engineers--advanced beings who created the human race. When they get to the planet they do indeed find evidence that something other than nature has been there (""God does not create in straight lines,"" as Holloway tells us), but of course, what they are seeking and what they find are two entirely different things...As regards the meta I spoke of earlier, and its particular application to &lt;em>Prometheus&lt;/em>: Michael Fassbender garnered a great deal of critical acclaim for his role in &lt;em>Shame&lt;/em>, playing a sex addict. An interesting choice to play the role of an asexual robot, especially when so many of your audience members leave asking themselves (or the people they were with) ""was David gay?"". It's a frankly ridiculous question to even be asking, and while half of me doubts that 90%+ of the people involved in the debate are even aware &lt;em>Shame&lt;/em> exists, it still feels like that particular casting choice forced the issue, rather like not changing the name of Noomi Rapace's character. And I've been mulling on this for days without being able to come up with another motive than ""provide non-controversy to get butts in seats."" Which seems to be working, but it feels a little disingenuous.But you know what else? I'm going to ask you to forget all that. I'm also going to ask you to forget about all those plot holes that aren't really plot holes (if you're watching the movie on DVD, pause it when they reveal the designation of the planet, then go back and watch the first &lt;em>Alien&lt;/em>; they're two different, albeit somehow related, planets), forget about the anachronisms that make this ship so much technologically cooler (despite predating it) than the Nostromo, forget this movie is in any way related to the Alien franchise, which it actually &lt;em>is&lt;/em> possible to do until you get to that last sequence that drove me up the wall. Instead, focus on the other obvious source material from which they drew when writing this script: &lt;em>2001&lt;/em>. All the stuff about exploration and the dawn of man and all that. That, to me, is where the core of this film lay: in the sense of wonder at the discoveries they were making. &lt;em>That&lt;/em> is what this movie was about, and in that, it succeeded as well as it could given the script tinkering and retrofitting and all the other silliness. All of which means this is not a perfect movie by any means, but it is a lovely one, and worth seeing. *** ",4,Brilliant film burdened with unreasonable-expectations baggage,1341532800,"07 6,

1476189,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,B005LAIHXQ,Robert J. Crawford,"[2, 3]","This is a good SF film, with concepts, mysteries, and strong action.  However, after so much expectation, it disappoints.  The story takes place many years before Alien, when a privately funded group makes an exploratory inter-stellar voyage to investigate some intriguing archaeological clues.  They are on the track of the ""engineers"", an exemplar of whom died mysteriously at the beginning of the film and whose whereabouts were hinted at in cave paintings found all over the world by Shaw and her partner, Charlie.  What they discover is not what they expect, to say the least.  Also, there are many secret agendas revealed, adding nuance.  In the end, as a survivor, Shaw continues her quest.Now, this is intriguing stuff, full of possibility.  Unfortunately, the execution of the film, its uneven acting, and problems with the plot combine to make a mediocre viewing experience.  I do not want to give away the plot details, but some may slip through.First, the quality of the acting was a constant problem.  While Rapace was great in Dragon Tatoo, she is supposed to be English but can't get the accent consistently.  While she does a good job with the complexity of her character's motivations, her intimate relationship with Charlie (who is terribly acted by Logan and never cogent as a character) makes little sense.  The other crew members were clearly fodder for destruction and the few with any character seemed rushed in their actions and motivations.  Theron is an exception to this, but David the android is perhaps the best - he is clearly not human, has inscrutable motives and emotions that are consistent, and is somehow always menacingly creepy.  Alas, the character chemistry doesn't quite hang together.Second, the explanation for the monsters was disappointing, indeed much of the logic of the film is wobbly.  While the engineers were very well done as beings of superior intelligence and seemingly incomprehensible motives, their behavior and what they were doing were unconvincing to me.  In addition, the resulting monstrosities were not conceived with much care, but just seemed hideous and violent, without interesting constraints and clear powers.  The development of the monsters appears too magical:  how could they develop so quickly, live so long and be so overwhelmingly strong, without a source of energy or food?  Take, for example, Shaw's aborted monster:  it continues to grow to monstrous proportions in the med lab with nothing but itself.  Even worse, after Shaw undergoes major surgery, she just gets stapled up, and then with some futuristic pain killers is fine running around and fighting baddies.  How could she do so without hemorrhaging?  Also, the way that David deciphers the alien language and writing and instrument panels smacks me as contrived.  As others have pointed out, the behavior of the scientists is also incomprehensible:  if one of them saw an alien worm slithering out of the cornea of one of his eyes - and experiencing no pain? - would he not quarantine himself or bring it to someone's attention?  Would the biologist not fear a snake-like creature rising out of some primordial muck?  Would the scientists not fear infection in an unknown atmosphere, but instead instantly take their helmets off?  These things are so ridiculous that they strain all credibility.Third, the effects were not entirely convincing.  This is a high budget film, but much of it seemed clunky, such as the creature that drags itself to the ship and offs, like, half the crew in a few instants - it looks like a flailing rubber doll.  Or take a creature that emerges from a character's stomach - it comes out bigger than it could have been.

1476201,AY76Q07AI4MBW,B005LAIHXQ,Robert Wallace,"[494, 560]","I'm reviewing the 4-Disc Collector's Edition.  I'll go through each disc individually to give you a good idea of what you will be getting, and which version you should purchase.  But first, let's briefly discuss the movie itself.If you haven't seen the film yet, you will still undoubtedly be aware of the polarized reception it received.  Some love it, some hate it.  Instead of giving you another opinion on why it's the best/worst film ever, let me tell you what to expect.  PROMETHEUS is not a horror film.  Certainly it has structural similarities to ALIEN, and there is one scene that I would consider very ""stressful.""  But overall, the film is what I would classify as a ""concept drama.""  That is, a drama that doesn't focus on characters, but rather on concept.  Don't let any of the tense trailers fool you, this movie was meant as a discussion piece, not an adrenaline rush.  You can decide whether it succeeds or fails when you watch it yourself.Onto the discs ...DISC 1 - 3D Blu-Ray (ONLY AVAILABLE IN THE 4-DISC VERSION)A lot of critics commented that PROMETHEUS had some of the best use of 3D they have ever seen.  Many compare it to AVATAR or animated films.  With expectations set so high, I was expecting quite a lot out of the 3D version of the movie.  I don't know that it fully delivered on what I was expecting, but here is my take on the 3D presentation seen on this disc.1) 3D isn't used as a gimmick where things jut out of the screen at you, which is a plus in my book.2) There are a few sequences that look absolutely gorgeous in 3D, usually involving holograms or ""projected"" images.  I also think that the medpod scene benefits particularly by the use of 3D.3) I feel like the depth of the 3D was under-utilized.  Almost everyone seems to disagree with me, but I felt that throughout most of the film, the 3D was a bit flat.  That being said, if you prefer 3D, you should get this disc in order to fully appreciate the aforementioned scenes.The image quality was near perfect, and there were no noticeable signs of ghosting on my TV setup.  Audio quality was fantastic, the mix sounded nearly identical to the 2D disc, so I'll comment more on it in my review of that disc.  Subtitles are also included.DISC 2 - 2D Blu-Ray (AVAILABLE IN ALL BLU-RAY VERSIONS)The image quality here is near perfect.  Most important for me are the blacks, which are quite striking on this transfer.  Definite reference quality material here.  As far as audio clarity goes, it's spot on.  The dynamics are up to a bit of interpretation, but it is worth noting that the speakers are seperated with precision.  And there aren't any silly choices made like dialogue coming only from the front speakers, or the back speakers being dedicated exclusively to music.  Subtitles are again included.The primary draw of this disc, apart from the film itself, is the surprisingly large wealth of bonus features.  We have two audio commentaries: one by director Ridley Scott, and one by the writers.  In addition, there are more than 30 minutes of alternate and deleted scenes (although many scenes have incredibly minimal changes) with optional audio commentary, and The Peter Weyland files.  For those who have not yet seen the movie, I would actually recommend watching The Peter Weyland files before delving into the film itself.  It's comprised of four videos (created for the express purpose of promoting the movie) that play very much like deleted scenes or webisodes.  None of the content is necessary to understand the film, but they certainly help give further context and depth.For any casual fan, this disc includes all of the elements comprising of PROMETHEUS's ""canon.""  So unless you want a 3D copy of the movie, or are into bonus features, the standard Blu-Ray release should be more than satisfactory.DISC 3 - Blu-Ray Bonus Disc (ONLY AVAILABLE IN THE 4-DISC VERSION)As far as completionists go, this disc is solid, if not perfect. I was hoping that FOX would come out with an extended cut of the film to be released six months down the road, but this seems to be the definitive home video release for the foreseeable future.The good news is that it's the most COMPLETE wealth of bonus features I have seen since the transition of home video to the Blu-Ray format.  From the ""Behind the Scenes"" documentary, which performed beyond my wildest dreams, to an incredibly massive collection of pre-vis sequences, artwork, stills, storyboards, promotional content, and more.  (Side-note: I love when they're willing to include marketing material like trailers, tv spots, and posters, because those so often shape our opinions of the final product.)So why do I think that the disc is imperfect?  Because there is more content that we were told that we would get that we're not getting.  In an interview, Ridley mentioned at least one deleted scene that would appear on the ""special edition"" that we're not getting here.  We were also promised an early version of the script, while the film was still a hardcore ALIEN prequel.  That was supposed to be on the ""second screen"" app.  Due to ambiguous legal reasons, that's not happening.(On that note, the second screen app is a nice supplement, but really isn't necessary to have a complete viewing experience.)DISC 4 - DVD + DIGITAL COPY DISC (AVAILABLE IN THE 2 & 4-DISC BLU-RAY VERSIONS)This is a bare bones version of the DVD and includes a digital copy. It doesn't include any of the special features that are on the standard DVD release, but those are all included on the 2D Blu-Ray disc anyway. (Still, it would have been nice to have them in DVD form as well.) The advantage I see with these combo packs isn't that I need to watch the same movie on a billion different devices, but if I currently have only a DVD player, and plan on upgrading to Blu-Ray eventually, I can buy the special edition now for only a few dollars more than buying the DVD on its own.Both the two and four-disc version comes with an Ultraviolet copy of the movie IN ADDITION to the standard digital copy.As a final thought, here are the different home video releases available for purchase:1) Standard DVD Version2) 2-Disc Blu-Ray (Standard Release)3) 1-Disc Blu-Ray (Walmart Release)4) 4-Disc Blu-Ray (Collector's Edition)There are also various digital copies available from Amazon or iTunes, but those have been available for some time, and like the standard DVD release, do not come with much in terms of bonus features.[EDIT AS OF OCT. 21st] Some have reported macro-blocking and various other issues with the 2D Blu-Ray disc and the Extras disc.  Not all copies are affected, but if yours is, and you don't wish to exchange your discs, you should be able to fix it by turning off your Blu-Ray player's internet connection.  It apparently has something to do with new copy protection protocal.  In addition, there have been reports of these discs working well after updating the firmware, and/or on different Blu-Ray players.",4,4-Disc Collector's Edition Analysis,1350000000,"10 12,

After a very long discussion at lunch, none of us felt we were satisfied and we agreed the story was convoluted and ineptly told.  So many unanswered questions and so many dumb scenes and situations that seemed contrived or exploitive and in no way touched on the very big issues that were hinted at.We're all educated and we love movies of all kinds.  We discussed the hints of pagan and Christian mythology as well as possible source material for the story (such as it was) on screen.  Was it lifted from Ray Bradbury's poem ""Christus Apollo""?  And why does it have an eerie resemblance to a ""Dr. Who"" episode that includes a Dr Shaw character, Prometheus and a big element of one of the apparent central themes?That said, Noomi Repace was excellent and so was Michael Fassbender as an android.  The visuals were of course cutting edge as in all of Ridley Scott's films.  But that's not enough for a satisfying movie experience.  This near debacle of a movie does not even come close to ALIEN.

Somehow, from five or six random circles on old cave murals, humans find the path to a place light years distant (which is a heckuva lot farther than the ""half billion miles"" the woman in charge, Vickers, claims).  Beware of plot giveaways in the following, although I don't think any of them is significant.It's hard to imagine a more unbelievably dopey crew than this one.  When they discover that the founder race's folks are dead, the male scientist goes on an extended drinking binge.  What a dumb slob.  He wanted to talk to the creators, and when he couldn't he took non-stop to the bottle.  Which also indirectly led to his downfall.  If he'd thought for about 2.7 seconds he'd realize that the master race is quite likely still alive, even if its crew on this planet is dead.  Then there's the Laurel and Hardy duo which turns chicken and heads back early to the Prometheus, only to get lost.  Even though they can give their position's coordinates inside the ancient structure and are being tracked on a 3-D hologram in the Prometheus, they're still turned around.  In order to make the plot work, one of these morons plays with the critter swimming around in the mysterious black goo running between the mysterious canisters.  By this time you're pretty much rooting for the monsters to win.It turns out at the end that there are many alien ships on that forsaken planet.  Why?  What happened to their crews?  Given what happened to the Prometheus's crew, does it make sense to confront the creators' home planet, other than as a suicide run?What made Aliens work was a believable plot filled with believable people acting in believable ways in a horrific situation.

Despite awesome visuals, ""Prometheus"" leaves you with a lot of plot wholes and WTF moments.But first - what it's about""Prometheus"" begins with a giant humanoid being walking near the top of a waterfall on an apparently pristine world.  Drinking something, he begins to slowly and agonizingly die - his body disintegrating while he's still alive.  We see his DNA break apart...only to miraculously reassemble themselves and begin forming new organisms.  Is this Earth - are we watching the creation of us?  The story jumps ahead to the late 21st century.  Archaeologists have found evidence of the giant humanoid's presence in drawings and inscriptions made by a number of Earth's unconnected pre-modern cultures.  Scientists Elizabeth Shaw and Charlie Halloway makes a dramatic deduction - the beings are engineers...of us.  Grabbing the attention of Peter Weyland, the chief of the huge Weyland-Yutani company, Shaw and Halloway are given the massive deep-space exploration Ship ""Prometheus"".  Their destination: a possibly habitable moon located in the orbit of a planet in a distant system, one that appears to match that found in the ancient cave drawings.  Their mission, under the nominal control of Meredith Vickers - a cybernetically sleek corporate rep - seek out the engineers and in so doing, learn the secret of mankind's existence.Now what WE thought:We confess we were seduced by the 1979-Alien-trailer style trailer for this movie.  Very few movies live up to their trailer, but the one for ""Prometheus"" was strongly suggested a very compelling story: scientists set foot on a distant world and discover remains of an advanced civilization.  They dig deeper for more clues, inevitably tampering and setting in motion some horrible secret left dormant by that civilization.  Soon the scientists find themselves dealing not with an ancient dead secret but with a very real and living nightmare.  At first the terror appears minimal - more ominous than implacable - and the scientists believe they can contain it using their powers of reason.  Each attempt do so fails, and the terror only grows, creating a pyramid of fear, desperation, agony and horrible death.That was the movie the trailer promised.""Prometheus"", the real movie, is completely different.  The scientists don't act very scientific - in fact they don't do much at all.  Ultimately, all the work falls on David, a beautifully artificial person programmed to speak ancient languages, read alien hieroglyphics, operate the technology of highly evolved civilizations and quote lines from ""Lawrence of Arabia"".  (Like Lawrence, David has left civilization for an alien wilderness - finding himself an anomaly in both.)  Although the scientists do find the world LV-223 to hold a catalog of horrors, the scenes of death and destruction barely link to each other as the trailer suggests they will.  At times it seems each episode of horror comes from a different movie, and none of them are all that vital to the overall story.What really kills ""Prometheus"" is the lack of a central mythos - that overarching story that holds up the one we see on screen.  The myth doesn't have to be fully detailed or even correct, but it must be compelling and specific enough to drive our characters, and exotic and scary enough to fulfill the promise of science-fiction and horror.  In ""ancient astronaut"" stories like ""Prometheus"" - The Mountains of Madness"", ""The Thing"", ""Five Million Years to Earth"" or ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" - the myth is bound by the actions and motives of godlike and long-dead beings.  The myth can be used to explain the ""why"" of the story, and while it can be vague, there should be enough to suggest something more than anybody can come up with on the IMDB message board for Prometheus.  There is only a paltry attempt at a myth here (the engineers created us), one that the scientist protagonists uncharacteristically avoid discussing (if engineers and humans have the same DNA, then that means that they are basically the same creature as us, rather than our creators; also if that was Earth at the beginning of the movie, and the dying Engineer brought life to it, then it means that Engineers have been physically unchanged for half a billion years - a span of time that saw dinosaurs rise from small reptiles to giant monsters and then shrink to become birds.  You'd think that scientists who crossed light years of space would have something to say about that).Despite its lovely looks, there's enough on the surface of ""Prometheus"" to make you scratch your head - from David's effortless navigation of an ancient alien spaceship, to Shaw's and Vickers desperately trying to escape a falling spacecraft (they look like Fred and Barney running away from a wild brontosaurus).  It's possible that ""Prometheus"" actually suffers for its beauty.  The movie is so primed to wow you with awesome visuals that it tosses out ""The Code of Alien"" which requires that terror be as unseen as possible.  Instead, the screen is packed with alien snakes, alien squid, holograms of engineer armies, holographic space navigation computers and reforming DNA.  Eventually we see so much that we're primed to expect anything except a story to make sense of it all.",2,Insure movie looks awesome - All other considerations secondary.

1476225,A3VNYMNK7OC7CM,B005LAIHXQ,R. Sardrena,"[83, 153]","Ridley Scott's first three films - The Duellists, Alien, and Blade Runner - established his reputation as one of the most fascinating directors of his time.  His intricate visual style, which he called ""layering,"" drew comparisons to Stanley Kubrick's work.  But the comparison was not apt; whereas Kubrick wanted his visuals to serve his highly personal intellectual themes, Scott never strayed too far from his roots as a director of commercials.  Scott always looks for arresting images which will indelibly remain in the viewer's memory long afterwards.  He's not a great storyteller, not a big ""idea man,"" and has marked impatience (as anyone who knows the story behind Blade Runner knows) for those who are.Prometheus is a collection of arresting images and scenes which - when considered as a story - don't amount to much.  The writer - a frequent JJ Abrams collaborator who helped turned Star Trek into execrement in 2008 - met his usual qualitative standards here.  Whereas Alien was notorious for one gruesome scene, Prometheus spends its final hour on a flesh-defiling parade of bodily penetrations and mutations.  In his youth, Scott bragged about his sense of restraint in Alien; he claimed that most of the horror in that film was inferred.  The septagenarian Scott could learn a thing from that young man.  Some vestiges of the good visualist remain; the harsh beauty of Iceland's lava fields serves as both primordial Earth and planet LV-whatever.  If Scott settled for an IMAX film about that beauty - or showed some semblence of good taste during the latter stages of the film - it wouldn't have felt as if one of his snake-like uglies slithered in and picked my pocket.  Instead, Scott conducted a symphony of pus and slime in an abatoir.  Perhaps in anticipation of what's to come, the space travelers find themselves retching as soon as they emerge from cryogenic sleep.The themes - such as they are - are displeasing too.  An extra-terrestrial source of humanity has been done before in science fiction - most notably in Kubrick's 2001 - and done better.  It seems that Prometheus' writer was watching an old episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation (""The Chase"") while working on his drafts.  Even the progenitor seen on TV looks suspiciously familar.  Prometheus is somehow sillier than this source material though, evoking memories of Erich Von Daniken's book Chariots of the Gods.  In that popular early seventies work, every exotic feature of an ancient statue or building was seen as evidence of extra-terrestrial visitation.  Though the protagonists of Prometheus are scientists, this film not only feels pseudo-scientific (we've come to expect that in sci-fi cinema), it actually feels anti-scientific.  It's not that Scott can't be bothered to get things right, it's that he would rather be wrong.  In a nod to changing audience demographics, Scott makes his heroine a Christian-scientist too.  It makes one think of Charlton Heston's rebuke of his antagonist in 1968's ""Planet of the Apes"" in which he sees a fundamental contradiction between his opponent's joint-role as both Minister of Science and Defender of the Faith.There's also a clumsy misstep here; it's always a mistake for a bad film to refer to a good one.  Scenes from ""Lawrence of Arabia"" are played here, including some choice lines.  It starkly reminds viewers of how far cinema has sunk since those glorious days, as well as how their time could be better employed.But Scott is right about one thing; his images are indelible.  I sympathize with victims in the Aliens films, always pleading: ""Get it out, get it out!"" and ultimately: ""Kill me!""",1,"In Space, No One Can Hear You Retch",1339632000,"06 14, 2012",2012,3645,"['Ridley', 'Scott', 'first', 'three', 'films', 'Duellists', 'Alien', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'established', 'reputation', 'one', 'most', 'fascinating', 'directors', 'time', 'intricate', 'visual', 'style', 'called', 'layering', 'drew', 'comparisons', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'work', 'comparison', 'was', 'not', 'apt', 'whereas', 'Kubrick', 'wanted', 'visuals', 'serve', 'highly', 'personal', 'intellectual', 'themes', 'Scott', 'never', 'strayed', 'too', 'far', 'roots', 'director', 'commercials', 'Scott', 'always', 'arresting', 'images', 'will', 'indelibly', 'remain', 'viewer', 'memory', 'long', 'afterwards', 'not', 'great', 'storyteller', 'not', 'big', 'idea', 'man', 'marked', 'impatience', 'anyone', 'who', 'story', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'who', 'are.Prometheus', 'collection', 'arresting', 'images', 'scenes', 'when', 'considered', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'amount', 'much', 'writer', 'frequent', 'JJ', 'Abrams', 'collaborator', 'who', 'helped', 'turned', 'Star', 'Trek', 'execrement', '2008', 'met', 'usual', 'qualitative', 'standards', 'here', 'Whereas', 'Alien', 'was', 'notorious', 'one', 'gruesome', 'scene', 'Prometheus', 'final', 'hour', 'flesh-defiling', 'parade', 'bodily', 'penetrations', 'mutations', 'youth', 'Scott', 'bragged', 'sense', 'restraint', 'Alien', 'claimed', 'most', 'horror', 'film', 'was', 'inferred', 'septagenarian', 'Scott', 'could', 'learn', 'thing', 'young', 'man', 'vestiges', 'good', 'visualist', 'remain', 'harsh', 'beauty', 'Iceland', 'lava', 'fields', 'primordial', 'Earth', 'planet', 'LV-whatever', 'Scott', 'settled', 'IMAX', 'film', 'beauty', 'showed', 'semblence', 'good', 'taste', 'latter', 'stages', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'felt', 'one', 'snake-like', 'uglies', 'slithered', 'picked', 'pocket', 'Instead', 'Scott', 'conducted', 'symphony', 'pus', 'slime', 'abatoir', 'Perhaps', 'anticipation', 'what', 'come', 'space', 'travelers', 'find', 'retching', 'as', 'soon', 'emerge', 'cryogenic', 'sleep.The', 'themes', 'such', 'are', 'are', 'displeasing', 'too', 'extra-terrestrial', 'source', 'humanity', 'been', 'done', 'science', 'fiction', 'most', 'notably', 'Kubrick', '2001', 'done', 'better', 'Prometheus', 'writer', 'was', 'watching', 'old', 'episode', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'Chase', 'working', 'drafts', 'Even', 'progenitor', 'seen', 'TV', 'looks', 'suspiciously', 'familar', 'Prometheus', 'somehow', 'sillier', 'source', 'material', 'evoking', 'memories', 'Erich', 'Von', 'Daniken', 'book', 'Chariots', 'Gods', 'popular', 'early', 'seventies', 'work', 'exotic', 'feature', 'ancient', 'statue', 'building', 'was', 'seen', 'evidence', 'extra-terrestrial', 'visitation', 'protagonists', 'Prometheus', 'are', 'scientists', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'pseudo-scientific', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'sci-fi', 'cinema', 'actually', 'anti-scientific', 'not', 'Scott', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'bothered', 'get', 'things', 'right', 'would', 'rather', 'be', 'wrong', 'nod', 'changing', 'audience', 'demographics', 'Scott', 'heroine', 'Christian-scientist', 'too', 'one', 'think', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'rebuke', 'antagonist', '1968', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'fundamental', 'contradiction', 'opponent', 'joint-role', 'Minister', 'Science', 'Defender', 'Faith.There', 'also', 'clumsy', 'misstep', 'here', 'always', 'mistake', 'bad', 'film', 'refer', 'good', 'one', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'are', 'played', 'here', 'including', 'choice', 'lines', 'starkly', 'viewers', 'how', 'far', 'cinema', 'sunk', 'glorious', 'days', 'as', 'well', 'how', 'time', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'employed.But', 'Scott', 'right', 'one', 'thing', 'images', 'are', 'indelible', 'sympathize', 'victims', 'Aliens', 'films', 'always', 'pleading', 'Get', 'out', 'get', 'out', 'ultimately', 'Kill']",N/A

Prometheus is a great Prequel to ALIEN. This movie answered a lot of questions I've always had about the ALIEN movie. However, after viewing this movie, new questions arise. Ridley Scott has once again reset the true baseline of any good SCI-FI movie. This movie is so well written and produced, and there are no dry or dull areas at all. This movie is all hardcore action from the word go. That's impressive! Alien movies are very complicated and can go off into any direction.

As, in my opinion there needs to be to fill the gap where this movie ended and the original Alien movie started.Stand alone it was quite a good watch.  Noomi Rapace (Lisbeth Salander from the original foreign language Girl with a Dragon Tattoo) is a good actress.  She does need to work on her British accent as she started the movie herself (and the child version of her) with a very broad, posh English accent but ended up speaking in accented English, a small criticism but one that can ruin a great movie for me.Guy Pearce is another favourite actor of mine but he just didn't work very well in his role in this movie.  He was obviously a young man trying to play an old man.  Just no need for that given the number of great older actors out there that would have fitted the bill so well.Like I said, so many more questions which let the movie down but I won't list them here as they are spoilers for the story.I wouldn't rush out to watch this but it did pass a couple of hours in a quite entertaining way.

1476261,A2A1HXFSAPA9A5,B005LAIHXQ,S. Der,"[3, 28]","I never seen any of the previous Aliens movies and as this is the only movie I seen, I must have to said that this movie isn't that good.My friends invited me to watch this movie because they got free tickets to go watch it and so I watched it with them. I didn't know anything about this movie going into it. Only when I got there my friends told me it was a prequel to Alien, so that's good because I didn't see Alien in the first place, so I'm at a good start in terms of learning about the storyline.I thought the whole idea of one giant race of beings made us was so stupid. And, how it all started was the group told this one being that he should scarface his life to create the human race was dumb. Then, all he needed to do was to drink some black stuff out of a cup. This would start destroy his cells and then he would drops himself into the waterfall. When that happens all of his DNA will now somehow create human race. The very idea was so stupid.I only like the graphics and special effects in this movie. All those star maps are very impressive. Also the look of the beings look very real and the aliens too.What I found stupid was that the main female scientist didn't want to bring weapons into the cave/structure. She said it was a scientific mission and so they didn't need it. What in the hell was she thinking??? She doesn't know what's down in there? Is she thinking they can reason with whatever hostile inside? Well, that's usually not going to happen. Look, they are the invaders and for them to go somewhere totally new like this, 90% of the time, it doesn't turn out good. And, they're not just going to a new place, they're going to a whole new planet! Dumbest move ever made!What even proved main point even further was when, they actually meet the creator. They waked him from hyper sleep and not even 1 minute into the conversation were they all died!!! Anyone that was surprised by that must be on the same page as the stupid scientist. Also, only one person had a flame thrower? Oh come on??? Really??? They should had all had 1 weapon at least, but they thought they could just ""reason with him"". NO WAY!!!Again, they are the invaders and they don't know what they're going to find. Most likely, it's not going to be good when they meet with whatever down there. The only time, the female scientist ever thought she needed a weapon was after she got back to her small safe pod that rip from the main ship. Then, she hears a noise. So, she gets a weapon? What in the world??? She now thinks she can defect whatever she finds inside. Anyone else would had picked up a weapon and ran for the hills, but no. Not her. She got an axe and now she thinks she can go find it and kill whatever inside. Dumb move and dumber moves.This movie is below average in terms of story and common sense. My friends told me it gave them even more questions than answers and so it was worse for them than me. If I had watched the other aliens movie, I'll probably give this movie a 1 star!!!But, they lucked out and I gave it a 2 stars just because I don't know much than what I saw. But, what I saw wasn't exactly, the best I have ever seen. I've seen way better other alien type movies with better story plots and things that actually made more sense.

1476263,A10M34X7D468CL,B005LAIHXQ,Sean,"[1, 2]","Ok. So, the good: Great acting and great cinematography. The bad: There are just too many random things that happen that come out of nowhere or don't follow logically from the action or are unexplained. Here are a few things that come to mind (and there are many). The main female character gets an emergency c-section, which was suspenseful and interesting. That's fine. But, she suddenly stumbles into a room where she sees their, supposedly dead, benefactor awake from his sleep. The emotion of the scene unnaturally shifts from the female lead's ordeal to the old man's awakening. Her very recently psychologically traumatic and physically shocking ordeal is suddenly an afterthought (and remains so for the rest of the movie). This is unsettling to the viewer because the plot line is not allowed to be carried through, or at least comes to a satisfying end. The female lead should be the one lying down receiving medical attention, not the old guy. The awakening of the old guy isn't even necessary to further the plot. Speaking of unnecessary characters, Theron's character is a total waste of space. She doesn't add anything to the movie besides her isolated chamber that comes into play at the end. Her presence also complicates the captain's raison d'etre. Isn't he the captain? They could have made him the evil corporate watch dog and saved some time and money. It's almost like Theron's character is included for star-power to sell tickets. Not only does her character not further the plot, she's annoying. Either make the captain the captain or eliminate the captain and make her the captain. There are too many characters in this movie with no clear purpose. Lastly, (and by that I don't mean the last problem) the male love-interest comforts the lead female character in one scene where he reassures her and it illustrates his zest of life, but in next scene, he is very quick to commit suicide by offering himself up to Theron. His actions do not follow what was established for his character. And, it is complicated by Theron's insistence that the door be shut and he dies (another reason why her character was a poor choice). It would have been better to have the male and female love interest have a tender moment outside of the ship when he realizes that he cannot compromise the security of the ship. Better yet, there could be an isolation area for just that purpose where he gets quarantined and he could eventually morph into something that the female lead has to reluctantly kill later. That would have added more meaningful, ironic tension to the plot, making us sympathize with the the female lead's choice to kill what used to be her lover. Oh, and another thing. The holograms and dead bodies are never fully explained and I don't see how they fit into the alien-development-ingestation-development-continuum.

Phillips ""Five5x""","[13, 24]","There are so many things about Prometheus that I think are amazing, but there are just as many things that completely destroys it as well.First off finding a planet by using cave paintings as your map makes no sense what so ever. Everything in space moves and changes so how could cave maps that are thousands of years old still work?Secondly the crew of the ship is utterly wrong. Instead of having intelligent people working together, we have what feels like monkeys playing around and banging on things. It just makes no sense and this quite frankly destroyed a big chunk of the movie. I keep thinking about the moon landing back in 60's and I wonder if the crew acted anything like the crew in the movie. I'm guessing more than likely they were proper scientist embarking on a mission, not a bunch of bumbling idiots that do not belong anywhere near a ship, space or an alien planet. We have the 2 laid back scientists, a Scottish soccer beer drinking buffoon, the evil cold bitch running the ship, a robot who looks like the lead character in Lawrence of Arabia, a couple of guys driving the ship that look like the type of guys that would hi five and say bro all the time, some other guys that are just here to die like in Startrek and plenty more colourful characters. These people are just not realistic especially 80 something years in the future and you can easily tell that these personalities are here to play all too familiar roles. Is it impossible to make a movie based around actual proper scientists and how they would act and react in these sort of situations?My 3rd problem with this movie is how the crew go about their business. Let's swap out the scientists for some soldiers, would you A. plan out your mission, find out any and all information you can about the structure you're about to explore and take the necessary precautions to ensure your crew were safe or B. land on a planet, run straight over to the structure and start firing at the first thing you see? Sadly B is the answer this crew picked. Who in hell would land on a planet, go straight to the structure without running a FULL diagnostic, run willy nilly into it without waiting and then just fool around touching things, taking off helmets and playing with doors without knowing what might happen. For god sakes they didn't even run a full life scan first! Who knows what these creatures are capable of, but who cares let's just go explore and see what happens. Here's a little run down of how things go. The crew finds a dead alien, while they look at the alien, David decides to open the door and Shaw's says ""we don't know what is behind that door"". They didn't know anything about anything anyways so why is she worried about what's behind the door? Okay yes they did scan the corridors that they were in but there could have been booby traps, diseases and an untold amount of dangerous things that they didn't know about so why is she so worried what's behind the door, it's not like they cared about anything else. My favorite funny moment is when the 2 guys run off because they are scared, but when they encounter life they decide to investigate. Didn't they try to leave because they were scared?, now they're going to play with some snake thingy's. This is just the tip of the iceberg and I could go on forever about what was done wrong.My last problem with this movie is the fact that this was supposed to be a stand alone movie from the Alien franchise, when in fact it is completely a prequel hiding behind mythology. Just because they focused so much of the movie on how humans evolved and their creators doesn't mean it doesn't have everything to do with the other Alien movies.Overall there is some amazing ideas, acting and visual effects in this movie and for some people that may be enough. I myself enjoyed the mythology and the idea that we came from gods, but the story is hindered by all the problems.",2,This was....,1349049600,"10 1, 2012",2012,3915,"['are', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'Prometheus', 'think', 'are', 'amazing', 'are', 'just', 'many', 'things', 'completely', 'well.First', 'finding', 'planet', 'using', 'cave', 'paintings', 'map', 'sense', 'what', 'so', 'ever', 'Everything', 'space', 'moves', 'changes', 'so', 'how', 'could', 'cave', 'maps', 'are', 'thousands', 'years', 'old', 'still', 'work', 'Secondly', 'crew', 'ship', 'utterly', 'wrong', 'Instead', 'having', 'intelligent', 'people', 'working', 'together', 'have', 'what', 'feels', 'monkeys', 'playing', 'around', 'banging', 'things', 'just', 'sense', 'quite', 'frankly', 'destroyed', 'big', 'chunk', 'movie', 'keep', 'thinking', 'moon', 'landing', 'back', '60', 'wonder', 'crew', 'acted', 'anything', 'crew', 'movie', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'more', 'likely', 'were', 'proper', 'scientist', 'embarking', 'mission', 'not', 'bunch', 'bumbling', 'idiots', 'do', 'not', 'belong', 'anywhere', 'ship', 'space', 'alien', 'planet', 'have', '2', 'laid', 'back', 'scientists', 'Scottish', 'soccer', 'beer', 'drinking', 'buffoon', 'evil', 'cold', 'bitch', 'running', 'ship', 'robot', 'who', 'lead', 'character', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'couple', 'guys', 'driving', 'ship', 'look', 'type', 'guys', 'would', 'hi', 'five', 'say', 'bro', 'time', 'other', 'guys', 'are', 'just', 'here', 'die', 'Startrek', 'plenty', 'more', 'colourful', 'characters', 'people', 'are', 'just', 'not', 'realistic', 'especially', '80', 'something', 'years', 'future', 'can', 'easily', 'tell', 'personalities', 'are', 'here', 'play', 'too', 'familiar', 'roles', 'impossible', 'make', 'movie', 'based', 'actual', 'proper', 'scientists', 'how', 'would', 'act', 'react', 'sort', 'situations', '3rd', 'problem', 'movie', 'how', 'crew', 'go', 'business', 'Let', 'swap', 'out', 'scientists', 'soldiers', 'would', 'A.', 'plan', 'out', 'mission', 'find', 'out', 'information', 'can', 'structure', ""'re"", 'explore', 'take', 'necessary', 'precautions', 'ensure', 'crew', 'were', 'safe', 'B.', 'land', 'planet', 'run', 'straight', 'structure', 'start', 'firing', 'first', 'thing', 'see', 'Sadly', 'B', 'answer', 'crew', 'picked', 'Who', 'hell', 'would', 'land', 'planet', 'go', 'straight', 'structure', 'running', 'FULL', 'diagnostic', 'run', 'willy', 'nilly', 'waiting', 'then', 'just', 'fool', 'around', 'touching', 'things', 'taking', 'off', 'helmets', 'playing', 'doors', 'knowing', 'what', 'might', 'happen', 'god', 'sakes', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'run', 'full', 'life', 'scan', 'first', 'Who', 'what', 'creatures', 'are', 'capable', 'who', 'let', ""'s"", 'just', 'go', 'explore', 'see', 'what', 'Here', 'little', 'run', 'down', 'how', 'things', 'go', 'crew', 'dead', 'alien', 'look', 'alien', 'David', 'open', 'door', 'Shaw', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'door', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'anything', 'anyways', 'so', 'why', 'worried', 'what', 'door', 'Okay', 'did', 'scan', 'corridors', 'were', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'booby', 'traps', 'diseases', 'untold', 'amount', 'dangerous', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'about', 'so', 'why', 'so', 'worried', 'what', 'door', 'not', 'cared', 'anything', 'else', 'favorite', 'funny', 'moment', 'when', '2', 'guys', 'run', 'off', 'are', 'scared', 'when', 'encounter', 'life', 'decide', 'investigate', 'Did', ""n't"", 'try', 'leave', 'were', 'scared', 'now', ""'re"", 'going', 'play', 'snake', 'thingy', 'just', 'tip', 'iceberg', 'could', 'go', 'forever', 'what', 'was', 'done', 'wrong.My', 'last', 'problem', 'movie', 'fact', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'stand', 'alone', 'movie', 'Alien', 'franchise', 'when', 'fact', 'completely', 'prequel', 'hiding', 'mythology', 'Just', 'focused', 'so', 'much', 'movie', 'how', 'humans', 'evolved', 'creators', ""n't"", 'mean', ""n't"", 'have', 'everything', 'do', 'other', 'Alien', 'movies.Overall', 'amazing', 'ideas', 'acting', 'visual', 'effects', 'movie', 'people', 'may', 'be', 'enough', 'enjoyed', 'mythology', 'idea', 'came', 'gods', 'story', 'hindered', 'problems']",N/A

Sadly (especially sad, consider Ridley Scott directed this), the script and plot both contain holes big enough to drive a tank through, and as always in such films it is BEYOND AGGRAVATING to watch characters - supposedly highly-trained and educated scientists - do the truly idiotic/lame things they do, here, to get themselves into trouble.

I opted for Instant Video and I think that the movie is so good that I should have purchased it to put in my Blu Ray collection next to myAlien Quadrilogy.Prometheus is a must for fans of the Alien franchise. It takes a more philosophical turn than the action-heavy Alien movies, but that's what makes it uniquely great. And don't get me wrong...there is ultimately plenty of action. It's just that Director Ridley Scott and his writing team decided to throw in the ""all important"" controversial questions: Evolution created Man? God created Man? Both??? Prometheus takes a ride down this slippery slope that is sure to get the ire up more from the pro-religion crowd than the scientific crowd.I'd be surprised if there's anyone here that already isn't aware of the movie's premise, but basically here's what you get: Some scientists/geologists/archeologists discover a clue on Earth to the beginnings of mankind that takes them to a planet/moon that will be familiar to Alien fans. There, they hope to have ""the all important question"" answered. And you know--by at minimum watching the trailers--that the crew get a lot more than they bargained for than just answered questions.The acting is awesome and the special effects are top notch. I was glued to my seat. I felt that the movie moved at a quick pace, and I thoroughly enjoyed every bit of the just over 2-hour flick.Is the movie flawless?...Heck, no. And if you've already seen the movie and you have not read the 1-star review on the front of the Prometheus product page here at Amazon called ""Take the Scientist's Survival Pop Quiz v2.0!"" on September 23, 2012 by Arthur J Bullock Jr, it is worth the short, accurate and amusing recap of the movie's major holes. If you've not seen the movie, I'd stay away from Mr. Bullock's review due to the spoilers involved.My take is that Prometheus fits in as an outstanding, unexpected, unique and unpredictable prequel to some of my favorite movies ever made.",4,Tell Me What You Believe...I'll Tell You What You Should See,1350259200,"10 15, 2012",2012,2183,"['Well', 'almost', '650', 'very', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'already', 'Amazon', 'Prometheus', 'more', 'fair', 'share', 'help', 'determine', 'not', 'should', 'be', 'viewing', 'Instant', 'Video', 'renting', 'purchasing', 'DVD', 'opted', 'Instant', 'Video', 'think', 'movie', 'so', 'good', 'should', 'have', 'purchased', 'put', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'collection', 'myAlien', 'Quadrilogy.Prometheus', 'must', 'fans', 'Alien', 'franchise', 'more', 'philosophical', 'turn', 'action-heavy', 'Alien', 'movies', 'what', 'uniquely', 'great', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'ultimately', 'plenty', 'action', 'just', 'Director', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'writing', 'team', 'decided', 'throw', 'important', 'controversial', 'questions', 'Evolution', 'created', 'Man', 'God', 'created', 'Man', 'Prometheus', 'ride', 'slippery', 'slope', 'sure', 'get', 'ire', 'up', 'more', 'pro-religion', 'crowd', 'scientific', 'crowd.I', ""'d"", 'be', 'surprised', 'anyone', 'here', 'already', ""n't"", 'aware', 'movie', 'premise', 'basically', 'here', 'what', 'get', 'scientists/geologists/archeologists', 'discover', 'clue', 'Earth', 'beginnings', 'mankind', 'planet/moon', 'will', 'be', 'familiar', 'Alien', 'fans', 'hope', 'have', 'important', 'question', 'answered', 'know', 'minimum', 'watching', 'trailers', 'crew', 'get', 'lot', 'more', 'bargained', 'just', 'answered', 'questions.The', 'acting', 'awesome', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'was', 'glued', 'seat', 'felt', 'movie', 'moved', 'quick', 'pace', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'bit', 'just', '2-hour', 'flick.Is', 'movie', 'flawless', 'Heck', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'movie', 'have', 'not', 'read', '1-star', 'review', 'front', 'Prometheus', 'product', 'page', 'here', 'Amazon', 'called', 'Take', 'Scientist', 'Survival', 'Pop', 'Quiz', 'v2.0', 'September', '23', '2012', 'Arthur', 'J', 'Bullock', 'Jr', 'short', 'accurate', 'amusing', 'recap', 'movie', 'major', 'holes', ""'ve"", 'not', 'seen', 'movie', ""'d"", 'stay', 'away', 'Mr.', 'Bullock', 'review', 'due', 'spoilers', 'involved.My', 'take', 'Prometheus', 'outstanding', 'unexpected', 'unique', 'unpredictable', 'prequel', 'favorite', 'movies', 'ever', 'made']",N/A

But having just seen PROMETHEUS at a theater, I know as a science fiction fan and as an appreciator of A-quality films that this was a good solid movie that would be bashed by many ignorant viewers who do not understand why this good movie does not deserve to be bashed. I have not read any reviews, but I imagine some viewers will bash PROMETHEUS because it was not as good as the original ALIEN or because it did not give them an orgasm while they watched it.Well, it is not a stand-up-and-cheer movie. Nor are most good movies, and you are going to starve to death if your hunger for a good movie is not satiated unless it makes you stand up and cheer. No, it did not have the impact of the original ALIEN, but that was because the original ALIEN was original and for that reason you should not expect an ALIEN tie-in to be better.Nevertheless PROMETHEUS has many excellent things going for it. One is the acting, which--from my perspective as an amateur--seemed perfect. No one smiled out of place. The characterizations were presented earnestly with depth and convincingness. Though when everyone does a good job at acting, maybe the credit should go to the director. Another excellent thing was the artwork. Cinematics, sound, art, background, props--they were all science fictionally immersive, setting a proper, believable atmosphere. I especially appreciated the concept of the Engineers, the giant hereditary progenitors of human beings. They were a good conceptual take on the mythological Greek Titans and they put Michelangelo's David to shame.Certainly the movie had its flaws. Every movie does. But they are not worth pointing out because the movie is worth your time. The story is pretty much a platitude, reminiscent of preceding ALIEN movies. Still it holds together logically, well enough, and it pulls you on so you can experience the good sound and visuals and the suspense. And if you don't stand up and cheer at the ending, you can at least be pleased that Dr. Elizabeth Shaw is one tough gal, with heart, soul, and inspiration.",5,"Good solid, science fiction cinematic entertainment!",1340668800,"06 26, 2012",2012,2128,"['Generally', 'do', 'not', 'review', 'movies', 'give', 'more', 'attention', 'written', 'word', 'having', 'just', 'seen', 'PROMETHEUS', 'theater', 'know', 'science', 'fiction', 'fan', 'appreciator', 'A-quality', 'films', 'was', 'good', 'solid', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'bashed', 'many', 'ignorant', 'viewers', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'good', 'movie', 'not', 'deserve', 'be', 'bashed', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'reviews', 'imagine', 'viewers', 'will', 'bash', 'PROMETHEUS', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'ALIEN', 'did', 'not', 'give', 'orgasm', 'watched', 'it.Well', 'not', 'stand-up-and-cheer', 'movie', 'are', 'most', 'good', 'movies', 'are', 'going', 'starve', 'death', 'hunger', 'good', 'movie', 'not', 'satiated', 'stand', 'up', 'cheer', 'No', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'impact', 'original', 'ALIEN', 'was', 'original', 'ALIEN', 'was', 'original', 'reason', 'should', 'not', 'expect', 'ALIEN', 'tie-in', 'be', 'better.Nevertheless', 'PROMETHEUS', 'many', 'excellent', 'things', 'going', 'One', 'acting', 'perspective', 'amateur', 'seemed', 'perfect', 'one', 'smiled', 'place', 'characterizations', 'were', 'presented', 'earnestly', 'depth', 'convincingness', 'when', 'everyone', 'good', 'job', 'acting', 'maybe', 'credit', 'should', 'go', 'director', 'excellent', 'thing', 'was', 'artwork', 'Cinematics', 'sound', 'art', 'background', 'props', 'were', 'science', 'fictionally', 'immersive', 'setting', 'proper', 'believable', 'atmosphere', 'especially', 'appreciated', 'concept', 'Engineers', 'giant', 'hereditary', 'progenitors', 'human', 'beings', 'were', 'good', 'conceptual', 'take', 'mythological', 'Greek', 'Titans', 'put', 'Michelangelo', 'David', 'shame.Certainly', 'movie', 'had', 'flaws', 'movie', 'are', 'not', 'worth', 'pointing', 'out', 'movie', 'time', 'story', 'pretty', 'much', 'platitude', 'reminiscent', 'preceding', 'ALIEN', 'movies', 'Still', 'together', 'logically', 'well', 'enough', 'can', 'experience', 'good', 'sound', 'visuals', 'suspense', 'do', ""n't"", 'stand', 'up', 'cheer', 'ending', 'can', 'least', 'be', 'pleased', 'Dr.', 'Elizabeth', 'Shaw', 'one', 'tough', 'gal', 'heart', 'soul', 'inspiration']",N/A

So many others have pointed out the HUGE plot holes, inconsistencies and continuity problems that they've saved me a lot of time and writing.  I will say that the film is gorgeous to look at.  Much of that has to do with the use of good, old fashioned practical effects...like miniatures used for the Star Wars films and huge sets built to human scale.  It makes very little use of CGI.  Because you're looking at REAL sets with REAL creatures, you always feel like these elements are actually in the scene with the actors because...the ARE, and it adds realism that most movies that depend on CGI today lack.That's the best thing about this movie.  Don't expect a cohesive story at all.  I knew the problems were going to be big when the space explorers land on a planet they've NEVER been to  and enter an alien structure they know NOTHING about only for one, supposedly educated ""scientist"" to say, ""Hey, my electronic analyzer said the air is breathable out here.""

It would take an entire 45 minutes of programming (minus commercials) to reveal one teeny tiny bit of information that may or may NOT be relevant to the barely-there plot...but you'll have to tune in next week folks to find out if that's so.

There is no natural limit to this imperialistic expansion of the scope of reason, unless reason does encounter something that is truly beyond its capacity to grasp.  Kierkegaard argues that such an encounter could be viewed as the fulfillment of reason's quest, and not simply a defeat, because 'the ultimate paradox of thought' is 'to discover something that thought itself cannot think' (Philosophical Fragments, p. 37).  It is the passionate quest to find this limit that lies behind reason's restless and relentless search.""

How can you not be fascinated with an android who (that, which, I admit confusion over the proper term here) loves Peter O'Toole as Lawrence?

1476310,A2I7NGKA8LPN89,B005LAIHXQ,Stacy Hackney (formerly customerS),"[6, 7]","The characters lack of common sense hinders the audiences ability to enjoy the story, and as the audience experiences a story (intellectually and emotionally) on the backs of its characters (by recognizing pretty and/or ugly human behavior), poor characterization and unbelievable motivation leaves the audience with few ways to enter this story.Characters without the basics of self-preservation make no sense to an audience (who after all are animals living in a hostile world).  Even the smallest fish (with the tiniest brain) will try to avoid a net, thus demonstrating a recognition of danger and a desire to continue living.  Most characters in Prometheus showed no such basic commitment to their own lives [SPOILER ALERT] (ex: upon reaching destination in the cave, almost immediately removing life sustaining and life protecting helmets on an alien, unknown, unexplored planet; trying to pet a hostile snake-like alien; and the list goes on).  Almost across the board the characters make poor choices inconsistent with life (which makes no sense to the audience as the story is not presented as a suicide mission), so no surprise by the story's end, most of the characters are dead.The problem is that in a similar situation, most of the audience would not have made the same choices.  I think a 5 year old would not have removed her/his helmet - the fact that the scientists, doctors and experts do so push the audience right out of the story and into critical analysis (and a critical audience is a hostile audience); dido for trying to pet the alien snake.  I think even an infant would have avoided the hissing alien snake (though they'd probably watch it from the safety of their parent's arms if they were a comfortable distance away), and I'm positive 99.999% of toddlers would have avoided same.  So when an adult male with specialized training - who wants to leave an area after he comes into contact with a dead alien, but is so entranced by a live one that he forgets all rules of self preservation, is promptly killed, the audience rolls their eyes.And it doesn't matter that this behavior comes from a secondary character.  Poorly constructed secondary characters (non-leads whose behavior makes no sense given the story premise and their job title in the story) ruin good films all the time - so much time and effort is put into making the primary characters appealing, that secondary characters' character development is often ignored.  Yet secondary characters provide the frame into which primary characters are placed; secondary characters provide the ""world."" If the story's world makes no sense to the audience, it doesn't matter how attractive the leads are, the story won't fly.  A story is only as strong as its weakest link and cannot reach its full potential with poorly constructed secondary characters.George Lucas comes to mind as showing a solid working knowledge of this fact as he demonstrates successfully in Star Wars: the jawas are believable as alien tinkers, the Skywalkers are believable as isolated farmers, the sandpeople are believable as opportunistic predators - these secondary characters' behavior and work are recognizable to the audience and so make sense and serve to strengthen the story, therefore making the story believable.  [A story is a proof, after all.]  In my opinion, the clear sign of a subpar script is poor secondary character development; in an expensive special effects movie like Prometheus, it's like putting a high end paint job on an inexpensive car.The audience for Prometheus would have accepted as reasonable the two lost scientists (who needed to have gotten lost by somehow losing their equipment, or some other logical reason, as no reason is provided in the film [a mistake on the filmmakers part]), spotting the snake-alien, fleeing, and being killed subsequently, if perhaps the snake-alien exhibited an unusual skill set prior to attacking (for example, being able to hover over the scientists, defying gravity, or any type of unusual hunting technique not previously seen, and done so fast the scientists have no time to effectively counter).  The audience could buy that and would have remained in the story, but it is impossible for most people in the audience to believe that anyone would wish to pet a never-before-seen, hissing, snake-alien.  Especially considering that these same characters recently fled when they saw a dead alien.The job of filmmakers is to create a story that makes sense to the audience - the audiences' reality is the ruling reality.  If the filmmakers' story makes no sense to the audience, the story fails.  Prometheus fails because the filmmakers do not understand that the audience judges the protagonists (good team) characters' reactions to the story's hostile environment and antagonist (villans) characters, as well as against the audiences' reaction to said antagonists and hostile environment.  Somewhat of a mental game the audience plays, audience intellectual/emotional investment in a film stems from an comparison/competition on the audience's part between the audience and protagonists, with the antagonists/hostile environmental as a backdrop, forming a triangle.  The audience puts themselves in the story, subconsciously, and reacts to the story's threats.  We react to threats as the animals we are - physical safety first, for ourselves, our loved ones, our team, our group.  In a way, the protagonists physically stand in for the audience (in the audience's psychology), and when the protagonists' reaction doesn't match our own when we assess the specific threat being presented in the story, and the protagonists or someone on their team comes to harm because of what the audience perceives as the protagonists' inappropriate reaction, the audience blames the protagonist, and subconsciously, on an emotional level, exits the story.For instance, had the scientists initially fled from the snake-alien and subsequently been killed by an unexpected, unusual attack - unusual as judged by the audience - the audience would have accepted the scientists death uncritically; but fleeing first was necessary because the audience's first instinct was to flee.  But the lost scientists were killed after one tried to pet a hissing alien-snake, something the audience would not do, so the audience judged the characters as nonsensical, blamed the scientists for their own deaths, and emotionally and intellectually left the story.  Prometheus takes a logic hit and does not recover.  Two hundred million dollars spent for a fail because the filmmakers do not understand how an audience engages with a story.Comparison and assessment are at the heart of audience intellectual/emotional participation in a film.  As the audience, I guess the challenging process of filmmaking, i.e., obtaining funding, attaching stars, scheduling, is so overwhelming to filmmakers that the audience's needs are often ignored, and yet studios seem surprised when expensive films fail.  But the audience never wants a story to fail.  The audience wants entertainment, pleasure, seeing a representation of itself on the big screen.  The audience doesn't enjoy seeing poorly constructed films - we pay twice after all, earning the money to view the film (and we all know earning money takes time); we pay again by giving time to view the film.  Time is the ultimate gift because we have a limited amount of it.  Therefore it is clear the audience, willing to pay so dearly for a commodity, desires that commodity.In Prometheus, the filmmakers had the writers kill off secondary characters in such sub-common-sense ways that the audience could not enjoy the story.  Characters in inexpensive slasher movies fall like flies, but the audience knows it's a horror movie and accepts the convention.  More was expected from Prometheus, prequel to the really good Alien franchise, but clearly the filmmakers ran out of ideas; no crime just disappointing.  The acting, cinematography, set design, visuals, and other technical work on the film was fine (though shots seemed to be missing). I am curious to see how the survivors fare in Prometheus II, so I'll check out the movie from the library when it is released next year.Grade: disappointing story and character development as audience comes to film with high expectations, but overall, watchable due mainly to solid acting, cinematography, and other visuals.",3,characters seem to have no protocals in place once they reach their

1476316,A10C5CJK1YKGV0,B005LAIHXQ,Steffan Piper,"[3, 4]","Too many unanswered questions on this film. I'm forced to post this after many months of thought and add mine to the sea of over 3,200 reviews. (3,246 as of posting). This film will, like Blade Runner, likely have several different releases and edits to shore this up over the passage of time. Hopefully Ridley takes care of this sooner rather than later. He's approaching the same problems that Weyland faced.Here goes:I've finally rewatched Prometheus one more time last night, after a long period of letting it digest. I think I might've seen it now 5 times total. I'm stunned to say that after all these months, no hype, no expectation, nada ... honestly ... that film had A LOT of problems.It was still good, but it was a definite let down. Better writing than Tron:Legacy? No. Not even close. The visuals were very good. But too many plot holes - and a whole sea of different plot holes than the ones people were bitching about before elsewhere on the internet.1. Why was Peter Weyland represented as an old man, since he was a master of robotics and making robots that look like humans? Cosmetic surgery didn't seem like it would be that difficult. He should've been represented as a young man, but still dying. Even in 2013, life expectancy is about to shoot up to around 200-300 years in the next 50 (for those who can afford it), so why do we see the ruler of the Universe incapable of basic surgery? Makes no sense. I get that people might have been confused about the difference of aging and physical appearance, but it would've fit to see this addressed appropriately. Just Google: Aubrey de Gray.2. Why did Ms. Vickers even go along on the flight? She could've stayed home and run the company from Earth (her main priority) if she believed that he was going out there to die, which she had stated. Her very presence after that dialogue killed her character. Did the real Ms. Vickers send a Replicant in her stead? This will likely open the next film if so.3. After waking from hypersleep, Shaw became shocked to discover what the real mission was and that the mission had a corporate interest that superseded the scientific. This reaction and plot twist was incredibly unbelievable and poorly thought out. One would be trained, debriefed and know full well what was going on, and expected, long before that ship would've ever leave Earth orbit. Recall Aliens 2, when everyone awakes. Everyone was clear on the mission.4. Millburn (with Fifield abandoned during storm) thought that a snake looking animal on a foreign planet, where everyone mysteriously died, that rises up into an attack posture, like a cobra, is non-threatening and a 'good girl'? That whole scene should've been removed / reshot / never shown. That is seriously bad writing. C'mon, ya'll. This scene has universally been derided the most and found to be the weakest of ideas.5. What was with the weird sexual energy between Ms. Vickers and Peter Weyland, her father? It was never explained, never looked at beyond the one scene in his bedroom, although definitely underlined. For what reason? The scene between Weyland / Vickers and then the later scene with Capt. Janek (Idris Elba) and Vickers, where he questions her about being a robot - leaves me to believe that Ms. Vickers, too, was a Replicant, and probably not dead -- yet. Here, we once more approach the ""I want more life, Father!"" Nexus 10?6. The theatrical version's end fight scene between Shaw and the Spacejockey was  way too convenient and over too quick. You could blink and miss it. The extended scenes fight version was the scene they should've shown. Editing down for time is always a bad idea and one would think that Ridley Scott would learn his lesson. I don't think he can blame anyone else other than himself on this one.7. The Prometheus had *absolutely no means of defense*? Really? Ramming the other ship was the *only* option? That's bad writing. Ship travels through hostile space to a distant location and not even a single missile? That didn't seem to fit the story line at all. Other ships in previous films look like mining vessels. Okay. Got it. But the Prometheus looked like a serious piece of hardware. No defenses? Fail.8. Strangely, the centerpiece scene of the film, from what I saw, with the most energy and action, was the self-abortion / self-surgery scene with Shaw and the Alien fetus. Odd that a scene like that would be the center-piece in the editing. Odd that a meaningless scene that was fully spectacle become the biggest scene in a film that was  ... 100% spectacle. Well, haha ... maybe not ...9. Having the waking Spacejockey kill Peter Weyland and rip David's head off for no apparent reason without any kind of hesitation or even having the Spacejockey ask how long he was in Hypersleep for, (like a Han Solo shooting at Darth Vader without even hesitating), was probably the worst writing of the film. Yes, it's a top secret Military Installation and he had to kill anyone on sight immediately, but after having been asleep for a few thousand years ... one would wake to ask questions ... no matter who you were. That's honestly poor character development. If you did that in a novel, people would accuse you of 'avoiding conflict / resolution' which is pivotal for any story. Thus, I'm accusing them of avoiding conflict in order to wrap things up too quick.10. I wasn't bothered by the falling ship scene as typically, when someone throws something at you, and you run away to avoid it, there's often a scenario where you end up running directly into the downward arc of it. However, that being said, the real problem of that scene was the physics of forward momentum, or lack there of. After those ships took off, they would inevitably crash down farther away in the direction of travel and not fall back to earth -- in reverse. Yes -- that was definitely odd. I need to see that one in a simulator before I would've said: ""Yeah, let's do that in the final minutes of the film.""And then there's this ... possibly the whole point of this thing ...11. Perhaps this film is actually, in some strange, tangential way, about abortion. Not the morality of it, which is what we humans seem to get wrapped up in, but the reality of it. Like the line from Fight Club, delivered by Tyler Durden:""Listen to me! You have to consider the possibility that God does not like you. He never wanted you. In all probability, he hates you. This is not the worst thing that can happen.""Humans now become D-Listed as an awkward, embarrassing accident. Which opens the obvious reality that -- we, the humans -- are a greater threat somewhere down the line genetically, than all these monsters we've set out to find or discover, perhaps including even our own engineers. Consider the following:A) Dude offs himself in a primordial stream and up we pop like a goddamned freak show.B) The Engineers panic and set in motion a desire that they need to kill these bashtards (us) off somehow, before it's too late. Like they knew we were too-violent based upon the missing strands of DNA that we lacked from our forefathers.C) Make goo -- make a boatload of it, enough to possibly wipe out two worlds -- ship it off to Earth -- wipe them out, because these acid blood, body humping, multi-strain life-forms are less dangerous than those freaky Earthlings are. Wow. Now -- that's something to consider. Those humans are destined to destroy everyone and everything, they're tribal and pretty stupid to boot. Eff those effers. Send in the bugs. Send them now!I give 3 stars, because while it was beautiful and somewhat entertaining. The writing is incredibly questionable. It doesn't deliver what it could have, or even leads us to believe....",3,Too many unanswered questions to love this unconditionally ...,1369612800,"05 27, 2013",2013,7705,"['Too', 'many',

The movie had great depth and stayed with me for days after watching it, which I did twice before writing this review.  The writing and acting were very solid and if the viewer paid attention, the meaning of the film was quite rewarding.  SPOILER ALERT!  The movie starts out with one of the tall aliens standing on a earth-like world, next to a massive waterfall, with an alien space craft hanging in the air overhead.  With a religious air, he kneels down and opens a jar and consumes some kind of substance, which causes his body to come apart and he falls into the waterfall.  His body breaks  into many small cells, which grow and divide as they are carried off by the enormous river they have fallen into.  This is an act of creation, and as the movie suggests, it is how the human race came into existence.  The movie then moves forward in time, introduces the 2 scientists/archeologists who have discovered that most of the ancient races on earth worshiped these tall humanoid beings, that they came from a star system depicted in cave drawings, and that humans could not have known about this system without modern technology.  The scientists call the tall ones ""Engineers,"" and they feel they are the ones who created our race.  A dying billionaire decides to fund an expedition to this system, so that he can meet his maker.There are 2 very interesting characters that mostly survive the movie- the heroine, Elli, who I felt was very authentic and a great example of what is best about humanity, and David, the android, also authentic, but not being human does things that are evil at times.  For example, he asked Charlie (the other scientist and Elli's lover) how far he would go to find the answers to the questions he has about the engineers.  Charlie says he would go all the way to the end, so David slips an alien substance into his drink that causes him to mutate and eventually die, but not before impregnating Elli with a bizarre alien that nearly kills her.  After a timely abortion, Elli and David discover that the engineers have decided to return to earth and destroy the human race, to build something anew; however, the captain of the Prometheus is able to collide with the alien ship, causing it to crash and our race is saved.  The one surviving engineer comes after Elli to kill her, but she outwits him, using his own technology (and something from herself as well).  Elli now has the option of taking another alien ship and returning to earth, but she decides she is going to travel to the engineer's home planet, to ask them why they wanted to destroy the human race.I like movies that show humans at their best, and this one certainly does.  Perhaps when they take a closer look at Elli, the Engineers may decide their creation was better than they thought.

1476323,A3A4ZAIBQWKOZS,B005LAIHXQ,Stephen M. Lerch,"[0, 1]","Despite purchasing the 3D edition of the film, I don't have 3D capability, so my review is, sadly, relegated to the standard 2D release. I purchased this set with the knowledge that one day I will go 3D and I will want this in 3D.The other reason to go with this edition is the bonus disc. This release actually comes with a disc of extras that you CANNOT get with the standard 2D release. It also helps that. at the time of this writing (and indeed, when I purchased it), the 4 disc set is a few dollars cheaper than the standard release. In this case, it makes no sense to NOT purchase the 3D edition.The movie:They do a fairly good job setting up the back story for the original Alien movie. I struggle with the things you always struggle when it comes to creating a prequel many years after the fact. Everything just seems so much better, in terms of technology, etc, than the original. In this, they did a really good job of really only making the alien ship something more special - it's ALMOST believable that this all occurred just before the original.As for the story, scientists figure out where ancient alien visitors came from and decide to try to meet them, believing they could be why humans exist. Off world they go. It's much better than I make it sound, I promise.Video:1080p AVC encoded. There are no compression issues and nothing you would associate with improper mastering. This section of my reviews is starting to look redundant - it's been a long, long time since anyone's put out a disc with bad video (that I've purchased).HIghly detailed and clear. Since I believe this was done on digital, it's difficult to have many issues between filming and Blu Ray release.As I understand it, the 3D edition looks to have a clearer picture, but I cannot compare so that is hear say on my part.Audio:7.1 DTS MA means you get the movie as best it will sound at home (as of today anyway).Astounding. Crisp, clear and as expected. Deep bass effects lend to the atmosphere, and there is no undue audio where it isn't needed. Music and sound effects are used to good effect and really lend themselves to the immersion into the film.They use the sound stage all around you and it's magnificent. If you don't have a surround system for this film, you really don't know what you are missing.Extras:You get commentaries and deleted scenes on the main film disc. You get the Peter Weyland files (essentially recorded interviews before people are hired for the trip to the alien planet). And there's a mobile app that I didn't use. That's on the Blu Ray (2D) disc.Then on the disc of just extras you get: Making of, enhancement pods (just little videos that add depth to the film or explain how an effect was done - nothing amazing, but fun to watch), Pre Production artwork, Pre production vis (you can see some of the sequences done with pre-final special effects), Various actor screen tests, time lapse video of the construction of the ship on the planet, Photo archive (production shots), Marketing gallery (poster photos, etc), trailers, Promo featurettes, and the HBO First Look video.In other words, if you think you'll enjoy Prometheus and want to dig deeper, you owe it to yourself to purchase the 3D edition with the bonus Blu Ray disc.Final thoughts:Amazing film gets a perfect transfer, both aural and visual, on Blu Ray. Chocked full of special featurettes, the 4 disc edition is well worth the purchase price.Recommended.",5,Fantastic,1358726400,"01 21, 2013",2013,3440,"['purchasing', '3D', 'edition', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', '3D', 'capability', 'review', 'sadly', 'relegated', 'standard', '2D', 'release', 'purchased', 'set', 'knowledge', 'one', 'day', 'will', 'go', '3D', 'will', 'want', '3D.The', 'other', 'reason', 'go', 'edition', 'bonus', 'disc', 'release', 'actually', 'disc', 'extras', 'CAN', 'NOT', 'get', 'standard', '2D', 'release', 'also', 'time', 'writing', 'indeed', 'when', 'purchased', '4', 'disc', 'set', 'few', 'dollars', 'cheaper', 'standard', 'release', 'case', 'sense', 'NOT', 'purchase', '3D', 'edition.The', 'movie', 'do', 'fairly', 'good', 'job', 'setting', 'up', 'back', 'story', 'original', 'Alien', 'movie', 'struggle', 'things', 'always', 'struggle', 'when', 'creating', 'prequel', 'many', 'years', 'fact', 'Everything', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'terms', 'technology', 'etc', 'original', 'did', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'really', 'only', 'making', 'alien', 'ship', 'something', 'more', 'special', 'ALMOST', 'believable', 'occurred', 'just', 'original.As', 'story', 'scientists', 'figure', 'out', 'where', 'ancient', 'alien', 'visitors', 'came', 'decide', 'try', 'meet', 'believing', 'could', 'be', 'why', 'humans', 'exist', 'Off', 'world', 'go', 'much', 'better', 'make', 'sound', 'promise.Video:1080p', 'AVC', 'encoded', 'are', 'compression', 'issues', 'nothing', 'would', 'associate', 'improper', 'mastering', 'section', 'reviews', 'starting', 'look', 'redundant', 'been', 'long', 'long', 'time', 'anyone', 'put', 'out', 'disc', 'bad', 'video', ""'ve"", 'purchased', '.HIghly', 'detailed', 'clear', 'believe', 'was', 'done', 'digital', 'difficult', 'have', 'many', 'issues', 'filming', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'release.As', 'understand', '3D', 'edition', 'looks', 'have', 'clearer', 'picture', 'can', 'not', 'compare', 'so', 'hear', 'say', 'part.Audio:7.1', 'DTS', 'MA', 'get', 'movie', 'best', 'will', 'sound', 'home', 'today', 'anyway', '.Astounding', 'Crisp', 'clear', 'expected', 'Deep', 'bass', 'effects', 'lend', 'atmosphere', 'undue', 'audio', 'where', ""n't"", 'needed', 'Music', 'sound', 'effects', 'are', 'used', 'good', 'effect', 'really', 'lend', 'immersion', 'film.They', 'use', 'sound', 'stage', 'magnificent', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'surround', 'system', 'film', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'are', 'missing.Extras', 'get', 'commentaries', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'main', 'film', 'disc', 'get', 'Peter', 'Weyland', 'files', 'essentially', 'recorded', 'interviews', 'people', 'are', 'hired', 'trip', 'alien', 'planet', 'mobile', 'app', 'did', ""n't"", 'use', 'Blu', 'Ray', '2D', 'disc.Then', 'disc', 'just', 'extras', 'get', 'Making', 'enhancement', 'pods', 'just', 'little', 'videos', 'add', 'depth', 'film', 'explain', 'how', 'effect', 'was', 'done', 'nothing', 'amazing', 'fun', 'watch', 'Pre', 'Production', 'artwork', 'Pre', 'production', 'vis', 'can', 'see', 'sequences', 'done', 'pre-final', 'special', 'effects', 'Various', 'actor', 'screen', 'tests', 'time', 'lapse', 'video', 'construction', 'ship', 'planet', 'Photo', 'archive', 'production', 'shots', 'Marketing', 'gallery', 'poster', 'photos', 'etc', 'trailers', 'Promo', 'HBO', 'First', 'Look', 'other', 'words', 'think', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'Prometheus', 'want', 'dig', 'deeper', 'owe', 'purchase', '3D', 'edition', 'bonus', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'disc.Final', 'thoughts', 'Amazing', 'film', 'perfect', 'transfer', 'aural', 'visual', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'Chocked', 'full', 'special', 'featurettes', '4', 'disc', 'edition', 'well', 'purchase', 'price.Recommended']",N/A

Details are clearly defined even in  the darker areas of the film.  At no point did I see any ringing as a result of the CGI scenes and no artifacting was ever noticed either.  Grain was never present that I could see and I can find absolutely no fault in any of the film's presence on this Blu Ray disc.Audio Quality&#8230;.I was very excited that this Blu Ray offered a choice between a DTS MA HD 5.1 and 7.1 audio.  Both are a lossless codec which will always provide a clearer and more transparent dialogue, soundtrack and foley effects.  Since I do watch and listen on a hi end 7.1 audio system, that they provided a 7.1 choice is always a treat. My system includes a center channel, two front left and right speakers, two rear side channels where my listening position is and two left and right rear channels.  The audio tracking included a great many discreet channeling pans and foleys to the side front and rear channels creating a very immersive audio experience.  To be honest, I did not notice any discreet channeling to the last two rear channels.  While they contributed greatly to the audio immersion effect, discreet foley audio from those channels were not heard.  I have watched and listened to this film in a 5.1 mode and could tell very little difference between the 5.1 and 7.1 mix, thus I was a touch disappointed with the 7.1 mix.  Never the less, the audio is exceptionally good no matter what type of system you are using and this, along with the beautifully produced video is why I gave the film 5 stars.  As a movie itself, it would not have been so highly rated.Extras&#8230;.Several deleted and alternate scenes which I always enjoy and the commentary regarding these scenes was really quite interesting.  Also included are a couple of full film commentaries which I have not listened to.

1476328,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B005LAIHXQ,Steven Aldersley,"[17, 27]","I've had the pleasure of seeing Prometheus twice. The first occasion was my first exposure to IMAX/3D and it was easily the best presentation I have ever seen in a theater. That prompted me to share the experience with two UK friends who were in town for my 50th birthday. Yes, I'm old.The most difficult thing to overcome when reviewing Prometheus is separating the incredible presentation from the story. Should I review the experience, or just the movie itself? I have chosen to comment on both elements.The opening shots immediately draw you in and establish that you are about to witness something special in terms of presentation. As the camera pans over the surface of a moon, you are part of the experience. As with Avatar, you are transported to a different world. The first shot of the ship is also effective, with the roar of the engines. Kubrick would probably turn over in his grave at the technical error of portraying sound in space, but it does add something for the viewer.Prometheus is quite ambitious. It does a good job of explaining some of the events that led up to the mission in Alien. We are shown some of the discoveries which prompted the Weyland Corporation to explore deep space. A crew is sent to search for an incredible secret, which I won't reveal here. Unlike other films in the Alien franchise, the presence of an android is explained from the beginning. David (Fassbender) is accepted for what he is without anything being hidden. The one thing that does remain consistent is that the android knows more than he admits. Where did he get that information?There is more than one alien species present in Prometheus, plus the humans. The story explains the origin of the type of ship discovered in Alien and we experience a small thrill of recognition. Ridley Scott balances new information with previous events in an effective way. I came away feeling like I knew a lot more about this universe, but I didn't feel that the original film had been betrayed in any way.It took me several viewings over a number of years to raise my rating for Alien to 4.5/5. Perhaps because I know that film so well, Prometheus had more of an immediate impact. However, there is one thing preventing me from rating the film as highly. The character of Fifield (Sean Harris) is a blatant flaw in the film. He's a British geologist with the personality of an idiotic criminal. He's clearly intended to provide comic relief, and I admit that the audience did laugh at his comments during both viewings, but his inclusion felt so out of place. Up until that point, the film had me fully engaged. The story seemed plausible and interesting. Fifield would never have passed any serious attempt at psychological screening by the Weyland Corporation and would never have become part of the crew in any realistic scenario. His inclusion pulled me right out of the movie as soon as he spoke his opening dialogue. His scenes with Millburn (Rafe Spall) were all ludicrous and I'm forced to deduct half a point just because of their presence.Everything else worked.I'm not against the idea of humor in a serious movie. Vickers (Theron) and Janek (Idris Elba) did have an amusing exchange which was handled in a far more intelligent manner. Theron played her part well and her icy personality was believable.The highlight of the film for me was the unexpectedly wonderful performance from Noomi Rapace. I liked her portrayal of Lisbeth Salander in the original Dragon Tattoo trilogy and was pleasantly surprised to see her tackling a role in English. Like Alien, the movie ends with a fight for survival, and Shaw (Rapace) is the equivalent of Ripley. There's one sequence which made me laugh because it was so outlandish, but Rapace played it totally straight and still had me on the edge of my seat and rooting for her. This will upset some people, but I think she was a more effective character than Sigourney Weaver's Ripley. I like both tremendously, so I guess it doesn't matter.Prometheus delivers in terms of story, action, and special effects, and most of the acting is good. The conclusion left the possibility of a sequel and I wouldn't be sorry to see that happen. It's always tricky when a franchise is continued after a long absence, but Scott really pulled it off.

1476332,A17639YIJLDS1G,B005LAIHXQ,still searching,"[0, 0]","This prequel to Alien attempts to outline what happened prior to the Nostromo receiving the signal that proved so fatal to its crew a few decades after the Prometheus mission takes place. The film's opening shot traverses a stunning landscape until we reach the edge of a raging torrent of a river that plunges into a mammoth water fall. Here we see a hooded humanoid figure walk to the water's edge and consume the liquid contents of, what looks to be, a steel sphere-like object that obviously doesn't agree with the humanoid as we find out in spectacular fashion.Cut to the Outer Hebrides in 2089 as Dr. Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace), an archeologist, is hacking away at a mountainside and discovers a cave full of what appear to be ancient paintings depicting, amongst other things, a scene in which a very large figure is pointing to a constellation in the night sky. We then find out that very similar images have been found in various other places on the Earth all dating from its pre-history, which means, of course, that the artists could never have met and exchanged information. Shaw, and her boyfriend/collaborator, Dr. Charlie Holloway (the improbably named Logan Marshall-Green), convince Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce made up to look like a really old bloke who looks like Guy Pearce made up to look like a really old bloke), the decrepit head of the Weyland corporation, that they have discovered a race of beings, who we come to know later as the `Engineers', and it was they who created Homo Sapiens, us! Weyland, who appears to have at least 1.999 feet in the grave, is desperately keen to make contact with the engineers thinking that, if he can have a chat with his maker(s) he might achieve some form of immortality.Cut to a team meeting in the spacecraft Prometheus addressed by Weyland, Shaw and Holloway in which the team are apprised of their destination; the aforementioned constellation that comprises a star with a planet with an Earth-like satellite; the apparent `home' of the engineers. The team comprises the `usual (united nations) suspects'; a nerdy biologist, an anti-social, bordering on sociopathic, geologist played hammingly to the hilt by a typecast Sean Harris and various examples of grunt muscle sporting mammoth machine gun type weapons, etc. All of this is presided over by an ice queen bitch, Charlize Theron, who plays Meredith Vickers who, we subsequently learn, has her own very special reasons for being involved.The plus points are the look of the whole thing which has brilliant production design. The movie credits H. R. Giger, rightly, as it's look, once we've returned to the Engineer's ship, is heavily influenced by his original artwork.The score, by German composer, Marc Streitenfeld, is also moderately impressive and even manages to feature a smidgeon of the original Jerry Goldsmith score for Alien, but lacks the latter's lyrical beauty and its insidious power to get under the skin of the listener to convey convincingly the sheer otherworldliness of the alien landscape that the Nostromo's crew encounters.The performances are fine with Michael Fassbender's subtly invidious robot, David, and Idris Elba's ship's captain highlights (although why he has to be American is anyone's guess).However, there is virtually no originality on show anywhere: this is sheer derivation albeit, in places, self-derivation some examples of which are:Guy Pearce's Peter Weyland looks like 2001's elderly Dave Bowman; Peter Weyland's talk mirrors his relative/namesake, Charles Bishop Weyland's talk to his team in Alien vs Predator during which the same plot point re: the cave images is made; the Prometheus crew members' space suits look as if they have been directly `lifted' from the original Tron; the ground team attempt to make the same stupid mistake and bring a contaminated individual back into the ship; the robot, David, is the same amoral corporate toady as is Ash in Alien and Elizabeth Shaw, who appears to be an expert in everything (including making luxury chocolates?) initiates the feisty female role later reprised by the Nostromo's third officer, Ripley; Shaw is impregnated as is Ripley later at the end of Aliens; the seemingly natural mineral `covering' of the alien ship is revealed by the hurricane to have a statuesque Mount Rushmore type face sculpted into it very reminiscent of the Necromonger's gargantuan statuesque Mount Rushmore type weapon delivery system in the Chronicles of Riddick; Shaw reaches seeming sanctuary after a truly crappy day only to find an engineer and a giant alien hexapus on board; a similar scenario to that which Ripley will experience a few decades hence; the engineers appear to be albino versions of Dr. Manhattan from Watchmen, and so on and so on.Part of what made the original so compelling was the make-up of the crew; they were all believable and behaved in expected ways and, largely, went about their jobs with humour and sometimes, apart from allowing Kane back on board, grudging, efficiency. The crew members of the Prometheus are exactly the opposite: these people have been chosen by a corporation who can afford the best of the best in terms of intellect, knowledge, experience, skill, versatility, the ability to think strategically and above all, logically, and they pick these buffoons?  That is taking the suspension of disbelief too far!  Ridley, what in God&#8217;s name were you thinking?  These supreme ambassadors of the human race make very brainless decisions throughout; e.g. why would you snuggle up to a cute little alien when it could be a killing machine and harbour any number of pathogens unknown and lethal to human beings - and this from a biologist! And talking biology, how is it that the engineers have identical DNA to humans but look dramatically different; i.e. 8 feet albinos built like over-inflated Arnie balloons? And how in Heaven's name does a robot `like' a film anyway?

The movie itself is awesome--much more so than i had dared hope.  I am a big Alien fan, and I'd heard some so-so things about this movie.  For me, this was exactly what the franchise needed...a sideways retool, not precisely a reboot, because the mythology is just being more carefully fleshed out.  Alien was a small focus, insular, claustrophobic horror film--perfect in itself, but it left much shrouded in mystery (to good effect.  I appreciated the laser like focus of that film)  This film is grand and broad, with a wider viewpoint than Alien, but it clarifies so many things.... A wonder and a treat.

Many people claimed the plot was confusing, or it lacked one, and that's to be expected from unintelligent movie goers. In fact, the reason I think so many people were baffled by the plot, or rather story, was because it wasn't a character driven plot but a concept driven one.This is a bold move for any film maker, but Ridley Scott's genius was able to pull it off.The concept this film wraps itself around is simply this: What are the origins of life on Earth? Where do we come from? Was it god? Or perhaps, aliens? There is a great line, edited out of the film but found on the special features, in which the lead scientist Charlie Holloway, played by Logan Marshall-Green, is asked what his scientific purpose is. He simply replies, ""To find the origins of life and smash all man-made religions proving them wrong.""Needless to say, this is the focus of the plot, and the search for this answers is what drives the mission, the characters, and the story.

Even `want' is seen as a concept by David(Fassbinder)the android.Fassbinder steals the movie as the gentle robot who models himself on O'Toole's Lawrence of Arabia and oversees the sleeping astronauts' dreams,does tests/examinations on them.Its all in the script. Ridley Scott has picked up a story which he made 30 years ago and tried to re-imagine it and failed to the highest order in his attempts. This was a movie made specifically to be part of a larger framework - at least a sequel and probably a trilogy. The meaning of life, immortality, the punishment by the gods, the source of humanity, evolution vs creation, religion,the scope was too big for the story,too cluttered for alien life to fit into a context.No awe,wonder,panic or dread as in Alien.Shucks!Star Wars did prequels inferior to the 1st trilogy.Scott has seen Alien sequels and wanted to cut them away and do a reboot return to origins,as the original director.Scott takes the Space Jockey-the dead giant humanoid pilot with burst chest found in the crashed spaceship along with the alien eggs-and ask where he came from.Prometheus shows an Earth expedition that happens on the site before Alien.There is no paranoia or claustrophobia in this version.The people who created us want us wiped out.This is like old concepts of disaster being visited on Earthlings for original sins.Beset here by ancient alien genetic engineering of humanity a la 2001 and Von Daniken.The director takes precedence over the writer Lindelof.Alien was hard-pressed,uplit,down-beat,post-industrial,a simple shocker about people we wondered would live through the next 5 minutes.That universe had been deeply thought-about, contained mysteries,had a sense of knowing more than it told,showed didn't tell.Prometheus is a complex movie asking big questions about the nature of the universe.Alien's modesty made it awesome,revealing mysteries and horrors embedded in its fabric(Of that which we cannot speak we must remain silent).I liked Noomi Rapace's Dr Elizabeth Shaw,she reprises some of Ripley's quick,fiery ferocity and anguish.Prometheus struggles to reconcile its origins-of-life quest with the need to deliver regular gloopy shocks.Here all surprise has been evicerated, most characters made expendable.There is a plot-twist reveal that is a non-event.The mission is to ""overturn 3 centuries of darwinism"".Like yeh.Ideas are add-ons not component parts.The later Alien's graphics look earlier than Prometheus's CGI fx(as they are,its just the director that used CGI as the Emperor's New Clothes to hide the shallowness of creationism run wild).From such a cast,so little.From such a director we expected so much.",3,Great idea crashes

It also shows things like how the medical beds/capsules are more advanced in the past than they were in Alien/Aliens so yeah, some of the stuff really sticks out like that. That advanced medical bed would have helped Ripley out.Another big discrepancy are holograms in Prometheus where as I remember the scene in Aliens where they had the big screen looking for the colonists in the table looking for them in the sublevels, this was the movie made how many years later too!  Some of the alien eggs are different too.  As a matter of fact so much of the movie is different I need to get the book so I can better understand everything what was going on.  The ending was a bit trite and would anyone in their right mind do that after what he did?  I guess she didn't know what he did to her guy but eventually she'll find out.  One thing that was a high point of the movie is how they showed the ""giant"" chamber from Alien where they showed the giant on the ""couch"" with his chest blown out from an Alien.

1476370,A2D63RN5LF14R2,B005LAIHXQ,"THE BLUEMAHLER ""THE BLUEMAHLER""","[10, 20]","Numerous artists, from Ludwig van Beethoven to modernist composer Luigi Nono and Trappist monk Thomas Merton have found useful symbology in the legend of the great existential seeker Prometheus. Ridley Scott's Prometheus (2012) filters the legend through the director's pop science fiction sensibilities. Prometheus is the most ambitious film of the Alien franchise, so it is not surprising that fans are not altogether responding to it.Alien (1979) was, of course, Scott's breakthrough. It is a film that holds up far better than many of the period. Alien borrowed from other films, including Mario Bava's Planet of the Vampires (1965) and numerous old dark house movies. A highly stylized film, its intensity is most nervously heightened early on. The infamous indigestion scene with John Hurt and the building tensions between Ian Holm and Sigourney Weaver (climaxing with the two actors locked in a mortal combat involving a girlie magazine) create searing impressions. Weaver's performance in the original film is a pitch-perfect example of femininity locked into Herculean survival mode when coming fact to face with H.R. Giger's impeccably designed monster of the house. Still, following the Jacques Tourneur rule, the most frightening of the man-meets-monster scenes involves Tom Skerrit, in claustrophobic setting, pitted against an unseen adversary.1986's Aliens (dir. James Cameron) was a rousing take on the Ritz Brothers (as redneck outer space Marines) versus a slew of aliens with a returning Weaver (complete with Joan Crawford shoulder pads and ray gun) leading the charge. While Cameron's Aliens appeased twelve year-old boys fantasies, it was also filled to the rim with risible dialogue. Weaver, surprisingly, received an Academy Award nomination for her second turn as Ripley, even though her performance was nowhere as nuanced as it was under Scott's direction. Her nomination, although deserving, is even more surprising when viewed today because she is saddled with eye-rolling, tough guy one-liners and a hackneyed scenario in the director's cut (wherein we find that, during her hibernation, her only daughter had grown old and died. This, of course, gives impetus to Ripley's later relationship with the the orphan Newt. Ok, we get it). Weaver, one of the most accomplished actors of her generation, is at her best when minimally directed. Her simple ""no"" in response a request to allow an infected shipmate into the ship in the original elicits far more chills than does her fist-waiving, audience appeasing, Clint Eastwood imitation ""Get away from her, you bitch!"" in the sequel.Scott is, simply put, a better director of actors than Cameron. Science fiction fables seem to find Scott at his most innovative and inspired. His last sci-fi opus was the brilliantly detached cult classic Blade Runner (1982). Considering how well Scott does in such alternative universes (Blade Runner is his most satisfying film), his avoidance of the genre over the last twenty plus years has been mystifying.If Blade Runner was an apt project for Scott's slick sense of pop surrealism, Prometheus is, perhaps, even more so. Clearly, this film is in an abridged state (Scott has said some forty minutes were excised). A full-fledged evaluation will have to be forthcoming with the director's cut. However, even in this truncated version, Prometheus is an amazing motion picture. It is perhaps best approached, for now, as something akin to highlights of an opera, with it's bleeding chunks of meat still providing a sense of wonder. Perhaps this film's most remarkable quality is its organic, painterly texture. Some ""fans"" of the Alien series have complained about the narrative loopholes in Prometheus. Prometheus is not traditional story-telling and those looking for narrative logic would do best to look elsewhere (although, expecting narrative logic in a science fiction film seems like an oxymoron).Like Blade Runner, Scott's Prometheus is a sci-fi pop theology picture that asks unanswered questions, which,of course, is a more appealing kind of theology. The Jesuit Tielhard de Chardin proposed that man most likely achieved his current level via external assistance. Science fiction is the superlative vehicle for such awe-inspiring, sublime riddle-making. (I do not think it's an accident that my quite thorough professor of the Hebrew Testament, Dr. Marti Steussy, also writes and publishes science fiction novels when she's not teaching and writing theology).The Prometheus of Scott's grandiose opus is a silent, chalky-skinned enigma. He exudes grey menace and he exhumes something more, but we're not really sure what. Apparently, Prometheus' bad case of acid reflux starts something. Is it life on Earth?It is the year 2093, the ship Prometheus carries its crew to a distant world. Among the crew are a pair of wise men, following a star of sorts--ancient cave paintings. These paintings point to the ""engineers"" of human existence.On this world, a pyramid is discovered. The Ripley character here is divided between two women: the scientist/seeker Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and company suit Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron, icily channeling Grace Kelly). Elizabeth still wears the cross of her Christian tradition, and is open to the possibility that universal answers remain divinely inspired. Her attachment to the imaginative symbology of faith annoys her soon to be martyred, Darwinist boyfriend Charlie (Logan Marshall-Green).Somewhat ironically, it is the company woman Meredith whom Scott gives the opportunity that Ripley was never afforded. When faced with the risk of contagion, Meredith takes matters into the hands of a flame thrower, rather than expose the crew, whom she is duty bound to protect.Amongst this ensemble (all perfectly cast) are Fifield (Sean Harris) and Millburn (Rafe Spall), who fulfill a kind of tragic-tinted comedy relief.  The characters Fifield and Millburn are akin to the types of characters Hank Worden and Ward Bond used to inhabit in John Ford films. The scenes in which the two are stranded, exploring the pyramid caverns, are nail-biting indeed.Underrated British actor Idris Elba lends steely charm to his supporting role of Prometheus' captain Janek. Janek is a blue-collar type and follows an engaging arc when he perceives a higher purpose. Meredith touches a smile with Janek, but her guard goes up in light of paternal rejuvenation/rejection issues (in the form of Guy Pearce as octogenarian Peter Weyland--a kind of Robert Quarry as Beiderbeck, seeking the fountain of youth). Meredith's shattered sense of security later morphs into survival mode. Although a small role, Theron makes it a compelling performance, which draws in the viewer.Shaw's intimate tragedy lies in that she cannot create. And she wants to create. This ability would bond her with the creator of life. David (Michael Fassbender), Prometheus' android, malevolently provides that opportunity. Shaw's decision regarding her unexpected ""miracle"" is, perhaps, the most intense, edge-of-your-seat, jaw-hitting-the-floor moment. It is an inversion of all the biblical miracle birth fables, perversely cast.  All I will say about it is that it should probably not be seen by sensitive expectant mothers.As superb as Rapace is in her survive and seek at all costs role, Fassbender tops her. His David channels Hal from 2001 (1968), Ash in Alien, Roy in Blade Runner, and Gigolo Joe in A.I. (2001). These inspirations build a bridge to David, who models his imitation of humanity from Peter O'Toole's performance in David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia. We are never sure how to feel about David or his motives. He is alternately curious and fearless, compassionate and sadistic, empathetic and impersonal, knowing and ambiguous, a bit like the biblical David. It is this ambiguity that makes him the most unforgettable of the crew.The interior sets of the Prometheus are ordered, sophisticated, artistic, clean and quintessentially precise. Perfectly choreographed to the visual design is composer Marc Streitenfeld's intoxicating score. But, the jumbled questions and plots are in direct contrast. Duplicate DNA would seem to be the point of entry into the new Promised Land. Rather than homogenizing the final, chaotic gaps of Scott's epic jigsaw, which sprawls across creation much like T.E. Lawrence wandering across the vast desert, this DNA discovery only perpetuates the puzzle, further scattering it. To be certain, the director's cut will be Prometheus` second coming, but it's a safe bet that second coming will be another layered vignette.* My review originally appeared at 366 Weird Movies",5,SCI

Now on to my review.----------------------------------------I have just finished viewing today 'Prometheus' and 'Snow White & The Huntsman', (see my review on the later as well).  I can honestly say viewing these 2 movies back to back, I preferred 'Snow White...'.  Let me also state that I am a hard-core Sci-Fi fan.  I am not easily confused by Science Fiction movies.  Not like my brother...come on is the time travel concept from 'Terminator' so complicated?  John Conner in the future sent his dad back in time to protect and i.e. father him, easy.  Why is this so confusing, yes John Conner is older than his father...in the future.  Well...I feel like my brother now after watching 'Prometheus', but I will give this review/analysis my best try.  Here it goes...--Casting Choices/Some of the Main Actors--Michael Fassbender as ""David"":  By far the most interesting character in the whole film.  David is of course an android in the manner that ""Ash"" and ""Bishop"" were androids in the other 'Alien' films.  Fassbender though takes a unique spin on being an artificial lifeform.  Every aspect of his performance makes him appear un-human.  The way he walks, his speach, the way he sits completely erect in a chair versus slumping down like we humans do.  David is also extremely intelligent, but is treated like a slave by the other humans.  They are practically calling him ""boy"" in the movie.  David of course is forced to serve, it's part of his programming.  Unlike other androids in the 'Alien' franchise, David does not go into hyper-sleep.  He maintains the ship, oversees the slumbering passengers and spends his free time learning dead lanuages and watching 'Lawrence of Arabia'.  By the way writers, cool move having David dye and style his hair after a young Peter O'toole.  I personally thought that was neat having him altering his appearance after an actor he loved watching.  Being alone for over 2 years though probably hasn't done David any good, solitude even for androids is bad...  I read that Fassbender modeled his performance after the replicant ""Rachael"" in 'Blade Runner' and the voice of Hal from '200l...', along with other inspirations.  This is clear in the movie as David starts to develope his own unique versions of emotions, which isn't good for us.  One thing, what's with the name ""David"" and Sci-Fi films?  David in '2001...', David in 'Independance Day', David Bowie in 'The Man Who Fell To Earth', David the android in 'A.I.', time for some new names writers...Guy Pearce as ""Peter Weyland"":  Pearce is the current Weyland in this film.  Apx 5 minutes of screen time is all he had, as an extremely old man.  Nothing memorable, nothing quite going into any depth about.  Just an old man desperate to escape death.Charlize Theron as ""Meredith Vickers"":  The woman with the power in this movie.  Theron's screen time is also not that much, apx 25 minutes total, which is probably why she is listed last on the opening credits...  Theron does not have many action sequences in the film, really she just stands around a lot.  I read tonight that she is a big smoker and this limited her action sequences in the film.  Limited them, ELIMINATED them more like it.  Acting wise she does not give the best performance in this film.  It ends up feeling like is was just a side project for her, a paycheck, nothing more.  Could be I'm also missing Sigourney Weaver.Noomi Rapace as ""Elizabeth Shaw"":  The Sigourney Weaver of this movie.  Rapace's on screen performance was paled by Fassbender's but still one of the best in the film.  A scientist out to unravel the secrets of our existence, she still chooses to wear her father's cross around her neck.  By far one of the strongest female characters I've seen in film, I mean come on the woman gives herself a C-Section.  I practically piss my pants when I hear my dentist rev up his his tooth drill, I doubt I could ever give MYSELF a surgery like she did.  The only thing I didn't like was that everything is going to hell and she doesn't leave.  I mean come on, if I was impregnated with an ""octopus"" and had to cut it out myself, I would be firing up the rockets asap and setting myself a course for anywhere but that place.There are other actors of course, but due to review size constraints on Amazon, coupled with the fact that most of the other actors give less than memorable performances I will stop here.***Plot Details/Analysis, Warning: Spoilers Ahead***The film begins with us the viewer seeing Earth in the past.  A large extraterrestrial space ship is leaving our planet.  A lone cloaked being is left behind.  After he removes his cloak we see he is fact humanoid.  He proceeds to open a device and drink a black fluid.  He then dies, dissentagrating and falling into the tidal pools below.  It's alluded to that he basically ""unravels"" and his DNA is left intact in the waters, serving as the base material for our evolution.  Okay...Jump forward to 2089, a team of archaeologists discover a cave with 35,000 year old (or older) cave paintings in it.  The paintings have ancient man pointing towards the heavens at a particular set of stars.  This alludes to ancient man having encounters with an alien race and maybe more...Flash forward another 4 years, 2093.  The ship Prometheus is heading toward an unknown destination with I believe 17 passengers.  The only awake ""person"" on board is David, an android created by the Weyland Corporation.  David oversees the ship and it's sleeping crew, rides his bicycle and shots basketball.  He also is in the process of learning all the ancient dead lanuages he can.  After 2 years of flight the vessel has reached it's destination and starts to automatically wake up the passengers.It is soon revealed in a crew meeting what the purpose of this trip is, to meet our makers, literally.  Dubbing this aliens ""Engineers"" the goal is to make contact and to ascertain the answers to our most burning questions about our existence.  Why are we here and all that...Not long after the crew has touched down and is embarking toward a structure on the planet's surface that is obviously not natural.  Once inside the crew starts to ""map"" the tunnel system.  It is uncovered that there is a dead ""Engineer"" in one of the tunnels, decapitated by a bulk head door coming down apx 2000 years ago.  This is also were the crew discovers a room filled with jars, jars that after the door is opened start to excrete a black ooze.  They also find the ""Engineer's"" head.  Without the crew noticing, earthworms start to come up out of the ground and swim around in this ooze.Out of nowhere a violent storm erupts outside and the crew is forced to evac back to the ship.  2 crew members are left behind though.  Once back on the ship Shaw realizes the ""Engineer's"" head is actually encased in a helmet.  After David removes the helmet our scientists see that the ""Engineer's"" are in fact VERY similar to us in appearance.  They try to reanimate his head, failing, and the head explodes.  After sampling some the head material Shaw is astounded that the DNA is an exact match to human DNA.Well...things start to go from bad to worse.  David cracks open the jar he has brought back with him and after getting a sample of the black ooze, purposely infects Charlie Holloway.  Shaw and Holloway have sex and Shaw is unknowingly impregnated with Holloway's mutated sperm.To sum up (I feel this review is becoming too long), Holloway mutates rapidly and is incinerated by Vickers.  Shaw is informed by David that she is pregnant.  After escaping the medical lab she gets into a surgery pod and gives herself an emergency C-Section.  What is removed is similar to an octopus and is not happy about being removed early.  Shaw escapes and traps the creature in the surgery pod.  It appears the worms mentioned earlier have mutated into a form of ""face-hugger"", complete with molecular acid for blood.  One of these ""face-hugger's"" successfully latchs onto one of the 2 crew members left behind during the evac.  The other crew member get's his helmet burned off with acid and falls into the black ooze, causing him to mutate and return to the ship and attack the crew.  He is finally killed, after killing at least 4 people.It is about this time that the film FINALLY starts to tie up some loose ends.  It is revealed that the elderly Peter Weyland is in fact on board in stasis.  He has been awakened and is preparing to embark toward the alien structure, in hopes these ""makers"" can save his life.  David has successfully found an ""Engineer"" alive and in a hyper-sleep chamber.  Vickers is revealed to be Weyland's daughter and she is strickly along to have proof when her father dies, so she can return home and become the new CEO of Weyland without any questions.  David admits to Shaw he infected Holloway with the mutating ooze.It is also this time in the movie that Captain Janek (Idris Elba) reveals what this place is.  This planet is a weapon testing facility.  The ""Engineers"" here are making biological weapons and this place is not their home planet, but just an outpost.David, Weyland and Shaw re-enter the structure and awaken the ""Engineer"".  David states that the bio-weapons on board were originally meant to be sent to Earth to exterminate us, at least until something went wrong killing all but one of the ""Engineers"".  The awakened ""Engineer"" has no interest in talking, rips off David's head and beats Weyland to death with it.  He then attempts to lauch the buried alien space craft and head to Earth with the lethel payload of black mutating ooze.  The Prometheus rams the alien space craft, wrecking it.  Everybody but Shaw dies.  David although decapitated is still functioning and warns Shaw that the ""Engineer"" is coming.  Shaw makes her way to the ejected lift-raft.  The ""Engineer"" forces his way inside desperately wanting to kill her.  Shaw realizes that the surgical pod is inside the lift raft and the aborted life-form has now grown to tremendous size.  She releases it and it attacks the ""Engineer"".  She escapes.  The aborted life-form turns out to be a giant ""face-hugger"" and quickly latches onto the ""Engineer"" and proceeds to impregnate him.  Shaw goes back and recovers David's head and body.  David reveals that there many ships buried throughout the planet and that he could if repaired pilot on of them and return Shaw and him to Earth.  Shaw says she has no plans of returning to Earth and instead wants to go where the ""Engineers"" come from, and confront them.Not long after, Shaw and David are shown flying another alien spacecraft off the planet, towards presumably the ""Engineers"" home planet.  We flash back to the life raft.  The ""face-hugger"" is dead.  The ""Engineer's"" body is ripped open and out comes a similar in appearance ""Xenomorph"" Alien.  It hisses and protudes it's jaws out of it's mouth...---Flaws With The Movie---I know that this review is approaching mammoth size.  If your still with me at this point, thank you.  I'll try to sum things up.This movie above all suffers from BAD WRITING.  Not much makes sense.  Here is a list off the top of my head of things that were not hashed out properly:1. Your telling me the only way an alien race could seed our planet with life is forone of their own to die?2. Why would the ""Engineers"" create us, than millions of years later want to killus?3. What exactly was the plan to kill us?  Drop that black ooze on us and mutate us?4. Why did David purposely infect Holloway?  What did he gain by doing this?5. Okay, so there is a lot of these buried ""Engineer"" spacecraft throughout theplanet, did they all suffer from breachs in containment?  Wouldn't some of themhave been able to launch?6. If this is truly the same planet from 'Alien' and 'Aliens', wouldn't some ofthese buried ships have been found by some of the settlers or exploration teams?If this planet is capable of sustaining life, with the only bad condition beingtoo much CO2 in the air, why were there terraformers in 'Aliens' transforming it?7. How does this all fit into the 'Alien' mythology?  The alien ship featured in'Prometheus' is supposedly I read not the same alien ship from 'Alien', so wheredid the Xenomorphs we are all familier with come from?  I'm assuming they werejust another weapon being developed, on another ship perhaps?How did the ""Predators"" get a hold of them for hunting?Sadly the list goes on and on, and I'm out of road here.  Obviously the writers for this film had some grand scheme in mind, but failed to transmit it onto the screen.---In Conclusion---This Sci-Fi film tries to pass itself off as a horror/thriller, but fails.  I was never scared or anoxious once while watching it.  Poor writing kills this movie's flow and leaves you scratching your head as the end credits start to roll.  Fans of the 'Alien' franchise who go seeing this hoping for answers concerning the Xenomorphs will leave wanting.  There is no unifying elements in this film at all.  I know that the ""Engineers"" are responsible for the creation of Humans and the Xenomorphs, but the explanations stop there.  Is this worth seeing?  Only if your a die hard fan of Science Fiction, but go into this knowing that answers will not be awaiting you.  Also don't waste your money on 3-D, I watched this in 2-D and could see no elements that would have been enhanced by 3-D.In the end I'll probably end up buying this for my collection, I'm a completist.  But I will be waiting a LONG time for the price to drop.  This is no more than a 9.99 purchase.Well that's my review.  Sorry for the length, this film DEMANDED an in depth review.  Now if you'll excuse me I need to go ice my hands, their tired from typing...--References--1.

1476384,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B005LAIHXQ,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[1, 1]","The writers intended this to be an ""Alien"" prequel by incorporating ""Chariots of Gods"" into the film, although some might question the timeline. They concentrated on creating a special effects film, putting science facts on the back burner. It's basically 60's science fiction with great special effects.Earth has been visited by aliens who created us, and leave a calling card. Instead of traveling to a moon of Jupiter like in 2001, we travel to a distant ""galactic system"" to a moon of a planet that looks like Saturn. The year is 2091, the crew is placed in suspended animation for a trip that takes 3 years, nearest star is 4.5 light years away. Sirius is the star frequently indicated as that ""ancient"" alien connection. It is 11 light years away. The writers needed to do the math.In this ""2091: A Space Odyssey"" tale, HAL is replaced by an android named David (Michael Fassbender) who like HAL has his own orders. When they get to the planet it turns into a special effects sci-fi horror as man tries to find his ""creator."" Noomi  Rapace provides us the only decent human performance in this film. In fact she was so good at one point they called her character, Dr. Elizabeth Shaw, ""Noomi"" in the film. They are either paying tribute to the famous Carrie Fischer ""Star Wars"" blooper, or their film editor is Ed Wood.The dialogue was written in such a way that it lacked entertainment value. It needed to be lighter. The theme of creating life, so that it is not special, bogged down the film. In case you are unaware, the earliest common human language was believed to be a form of ""click"" language. I waited for Fassbender to start clicking when he spoke the alien language to show me the extensive research the writers did. It didn't happen.Why is there always some idiot who takes off his helmet to test the air in these films? It's not the oxygen, its the foreign microbes, stupid!Great movie to let the teens go see. Yes, I liked the film, but the writers were a let down. The good news is we can gut part of the voice track and do over the text and make it science fiction presentable without any re-shooting. Heck we might even add a joke or two... ""These two earthlings, one an android, land on this alien planet and say, ""Why did you create us?""....SPOILER: And if you haven't figured it out from watching 3 movies...the reason why we were created is to generate a species genetically similar to the ""creators"" so they could test their biological weapons out on us, i.e. those alien critters.Parental Guide: 1 f-bomb, 2 people in bed, near sex, no nudity, brief hot chicks.

1476388,A2IL4AJIXXXLEM,B005LAIHXQ,the smart guy,"[4, 16]","Prometheus was a lot smaller than I expected this is because the plot takes place on the space station and the alien planet which sets the scene for a trite stereotypical science fiction movie. Prometheus is clearly not the typical high standard artistic Ridley Scott masterpiece that one would expect. The acting was pretentious and forced throughout the movie which was the most obvious disappointment. The actor who played the Captain (Idris Elba) was notably the worst actor: he appeared to have hated working on the movie the most. For instance when a harsh windstorm tears down the team he just sits there mumbling to himself and not truly caring as he watches the team get blasted on a high-tech spaceship monitor. Furthermore, it seemed as if the actors hated working on the set with each other and with Ridley Scott.The script was average but great actors could have redeemed that flaw. The movie progressed very slowly as the languid main actress Noomi Rapace(the scientist/doctor) discovers what look like cave drawings and cryptic writings. She determined without proof that whoever wrote that also engineered humans. A sub-plot includes Dr. Weyland who expects to find a cure for old age on the mysterious planet. Dr. Weyland is in for a shock when the blue humanoid man who is found hibernating inside the planet reacts with hostility.As the movie slowly progressed it seemed to me that Ridley Scott borrowed many ideas from Star Trek: The Next Generation rather than working with previous ideas from the Alien series. There are also no hints of Blade Runner elements in Prometheus. Rather than innovating and making a progressive science fiction movie this is more of a return to the Star Trek era which is unoriginal to say the least.What saves this movie from being a complete disappointment is that it gets more intriguing, foreboding, ominous, and eerie as it progressed. The level of gore and violence was stereotypical for any modern science fiction movie made after the 1990's era; causing me to disagree with those reviewers who stated that Prometheus was more of a horror movie. Prometheus is not a horror movie although there is a bizarre and terrifying scene where Noomi Rapace must have an automated mechanical c section in order to remove an Alien squid. The baby squid Alien looked both ridiculous and eerie which didn't add any sparkle to the already odd movie. The other mildly horrific moments were quick, to the point, and odd: that included a giant alien squid attack on a blue humanoid that was originally hibernating from within the planet; and at the end of the movie the blue humanoid grotesquely gives birth to what looks like The Alien from the first Alien movie.In addition to that there are a few long drawn out scenes where the team explores the planet; several frightening windstorms; a random creature attack which breaks one of the team member's arms; a random zombie attack; and an enormous spaceship literally crashed on and crushed Charlize Theron's annoying character.Unfortunately, the production design and set design are average. There is nothing unique or notable about that. The creatures, and special effects looked out-dated by at least 6 years. I believe H.R. Giger did not work on this movie which was a shame.Overall, this movie was very intriguing starting in the middle part and I was not bored. However, Prometheus seemed rushed, forced, pretentious, and ultimately like a Star Trek: The Next Generation movie. Noomi Repace's underwhelming performance was a disappointment considering how Alien fans are accustomed to the power and strength of the Ripley female character. Charlize Theron's character was catty, antagonistic, and selfish: nothing interesting there. At one point the ship's captain asks if she is a robot. Michael Fassbender performed well as the creepy narcissistic android but wasn't anything very special. The team that explores the planet is dull and doesn't add anything to the movie. The movie itself was filmed well: the cinematography shots throughout the movie were interesting but nothing that lived up to the original Alien movie or Blade Runner.As of now I give this move a C+. I recommend you watch it if you like Star Trek: The Next Generation and Star Trek (the movie remake).",3,Prometheus is more like Star Trek: The Next Generation and Deep Space Nine.,1344902400,"08 14, 2012",2012,4270,"['Prometheus', 'was', 'lot', 'smaller', 'expected', 'plot', 'place', 'space', 'station', 'alien', 'planet', 'scene', 'trite', 'stereotypical', 'science', 'fiction', 'movie', 'Prometheus', 'clearly', 'not', 'typical', 'high', 'standard', 'artistic', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'masterpiece', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'acting', 'was', 'pretentious', 'forced', 'movie', 'was', 'most', 'obvious', 'disappointment', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Captain', 'Idris', 'Elba', 'was', 'notably', 'worst', 'actor', 'appeared', 'have', 'hated', 'working', 'movie', 'most', 'instance', 'when', 'harsh', 'windstorm', 'tears', 'down', 'team', 'just', 'there', 'mumbling', 'not', 'truly', 'caring', 'team', 'get', 'blasted', 'high-tech', 'spaceship', 'monitor', 'Furthermore', 'seemed', 'actors', 'hated', 'working', 'set', 'other', 'Ridley', 'Scott.The', 'script', 'was', 'average', 'great', 'actors', 'could', 'have', 'redeemed', 'flaw', 'movie', 'progressed', 'very', 'slowly', 'languid', 'main', 'actress', 'Noomi', 'Rapace', 'scientist/doctor', 'what', 'look', 'cave', 'drawings', 'cryptic', 'writings', 'determined', 'proof', 'whoever', 'wrote', 'also', 'engineered', 'humans', 'sub-plot', 'Dr.', 'Weyland', 'who', 'find', 'cure', 'old', 'age', 'mysterious', 'planet', 'Dr.', 'Weyland', 'shock', 'when', 'blue', 'humanoid', 'man', 'who', 'found', 'hibernating', 'planet', 'movie', 'slowly', 'progressed', 'seemed', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'borrowed', 'many', 'ideas', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'rather', 'working', 'previous', 'ideas', 'Alien', 'series', 'are', 'also', 'hints', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'elements', 'Prometheus', 'Rather', 'innovating', 'making', 'progressive', 'science', 'fiction', 'movie', 'more', 'return', 'Star', 'Trek', 'era', 'unoriginal', 'say', 'least.What', 'movie', 'being', 'complete', 'disappointment', 'more', 'intriguing', 'foreboding', 'ominous', 'eerie', 'progressed', 'level', 'gore', 'violence', 'was', 'stereotypical', 'modern', 'science', 'fiction', 'movie', 'made', '1990', 'era', 'causing', 'disagree', 'reviewers', 'who', 'stated', 'Prometheus', 'was', 'more', 'horror', 'movie', 'Prometheus', 'not', 'horror', 'movie', 'bizarre', 'terrifying', 'scene', 'where', 'Noomi', 'Rapace', 'must', 'have', 'automated', 'mechanical', 'c', 'section', 'order', 'remove', 'Alien', 'squid', 'baby', 'squid', 'Alien', 'looked', 'ridiculous', 'eerie', 'did', ""n't"", 'add', 'sparkle', 'already', 'odd', 'movie', 'other', 'mildly', 'horrific', 'moments', 'were', 'quick', 'point', 'odd', 'included', 'giant', 'alien', 'squid', 'attack', 'blue', 'humanoid', 'was', 'originally', 'hibernating', 'planet', 'end', 'movie', 'blue', 'humanoid', 'grotesquely', 'birth', 'what', 'Alien', 'first', 'Alien', 'movie.In', 'addition', 'are', 'few', 'long', 'drawn', 'out', 'scenes', 'where', 'team', 'planet', 'several', 'frightening', 'windstorms', 'random', 'creature', 'attack', 'one', 'team', 'member', 'arms', 'random', 'zombie', 'attack', 'enormous', 'spaceship', 'literally', 'crashed', 'crushed', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'annoying', 'character.Unfortunately', 'production', 'design', 'set', 'design', 'are', 'average', 'nothing', 'unique', 'notable', 'creatures', 'special', 'effects', 'looked', 'out-dated', 'least', '6', 'years', 'believe', 'H.R', 'Giger', 'did', 'not', 'work', 'movie', 'was', 'shame.Overall', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'intriguing', 'starting', 'middle', 'part', 'was', 'not', 'bored', 'However', 'Prometheus', 'seemed', 'rushed', 'forced', 'pretentious', 'ultimately', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'movie', 'Noomi', 'Repace', 'underwhelming', 'performance', 'was', 'disappointment', 'considering', 'how', 'Alien', 'fans', 'are', 'accustomed', 'power', 'strength', 'Ripley', 'female', 'character', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'character', 'was', 'catty', 'antagonistic', 'selfish', 'nothing', 'interesting', 'there', 'one', 'point', 'ship', 'captain', 'robot', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'performed', 'well', 'creepy', 'narcissistic', 'android', 'was', ""n't"", 'anything', 'very', 'special', 'team', 'planet', 'dull', ""n't"", 'add', 'anything', 'movie', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'well', 'cinematography', 'shots', 'movie', 'were', 'interesting', 'nothing', 'lived', 'up', 'original', 'Alien', 'movie', 'Blade', 'Runner.As', 'now', 'give', 'move', 'C+', 'recommend', 'watch', 'like', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'Star', 'Trek', 'movie', 'remake']",N/A
1476389,A17INQNCZ1HMHL,B005LAIHXQ,TheSnowman,"[0, 1]","I watched this movie in the theater. While it has its plot holes and is not what many people expected from a prequel, I think it is a good movie.The story is a bit flimsy, but I'm not sure there is a way to set up the phenomenal movies of Alien and Aliens that wouldn't be flimsy. It is almost one of those back stories that is better off not filled in. Regardless, I knew going into it that an Alien prequel would be some tall shoes to fill. Besides, it is an action/suspense movie, I wasn't expecting an award winning screenplay.Visually, the movie is very good. Many special effects were filmed the old fashioned way with puppets, wires, etc. and edited only slightly. This adds a nice touch compared to some movies where entire sequences are either blue screened or just pure CGI. The visual effects honestly reminded me of Terminator 2, the first A movie to have a lot of computer effects. Both movies used CGI sparingly and to great effect.Despite some of the shortcomings of the movie, I like it and bought this at full price when it became available. There are only two real gripes I have about the movie.The movie has an R rating due to a single scene near the end. If they were not going to edit or omit that scene to reduce the rating, why couldn't they make other scenes more gory and worthy of an R rating? It wouldn't have hurt.Second, it takes suspension of disbelief to accept interstellar travel and other sci-fi elements in this movie. I am okay with that. I'll take quite a bit of sci-fi in a movie and be okay with it. Even a machine that can perform automated surgery... in the future! In space! Fine. But if a machine can perform surgery, why not go all the way and give it a laser that can cauterize and seal flesh instead of using staples I can buy at the store? For a real humorous take on this, youtube the honest trailer for this movie. See what a person can do after having surgery. Walking hurts: but running and rappelling is okay?Anyway, I like the movie but can't give it five stars.

The title of director Ridley Scott's Alien prequel says a lot doesn't it?

1476403,AJYGQV81FSFE2,B005LAIHXQ,Timothy P. Scanlon,"[6, 16]","Director Ridley Scott tends to anti-corporate themes. InAlienof this is a prequel, the corporation (Okay. I forgot its name.) attempted to capture a species as a weapon, even at the expense of the crew of the ship.And all the alien-themed films (onlyAlienandAlienswere worth taking seriously) had androids as main characters. So there's a predictabilty about them that can be a little disconcerting, despite the good acting on the part of all of them. (As others pointed out, Michael Fassbender plays the role in this film).This story starts with a rather pale humanoid drinking something that consumes him. Next, we're with some archaeologists who find similar artistic reference in a 35,000 year old art work in Scotlant. it seems that such ""extraterrestrial references"" are all over the globe. Consequently, next we're on a ship flying to a planet where the humanoid in the first scene comes from.The underlying theme of this film is represented--yes--by a cross; one of the archaologists had been given a cross to wear around her neck. Its symbolism was related to her search, for meaning, and specifically for our (human) origin.After that it wsa predominantly an adventure movie. To be sure, it was well done. It had some of the best special effects I've ever seen, I won't deny that. And I've always respected Idris Elba (Stringer Bell on The Wire: The Complete Series), especially that he's a Londoner and, like in ""The Wire,"" in this film, he's adept at African American accent and jargon. And, true, Fassbender was good, as were most of the others. But, while I know it was an Alien prequel, it didn't do a good job of leading into that, except that this disgusting creature exists, and will appear again in the Alien series.In that sense, the film was a little of a let down.So, again, from an adventure film perspective, it was good; from a special effects perspective, it was great.

I have now seen this film 4 times: first in the theater, then 3 times at home on Blu-ray. It took watching it with the director's commentary and again with the screenwriters' commentaries to appreciate the great scope of vision these guys had when making this film. Watching it the fourth time was the fulfilling experience I had hoped for in the first place.  So, shouldn't a film stand on its own?  Should a great film be ""great"" with only a single viewing?I am old enough to have seen 2001 A Space Odyssey in a first run engagement, and I can tell you that very few left the theater ""getting it."" While it generated a lot of discussion, not many claimed to have loved it. I believe if we had a review system like Amazon, the film would have earned marks similar to what Prometheus is getting. I still find it difficult to sit through, but most today consider 2001 A Space Odyssey to be a classic.Nobody will put Prometheus in the same conversation as 2001, except to compare the character David with HAL.  Unfortunate, because Prometheus is technically as well crafted and thematically as challenging. It is possible that its detractors will view Prometheus in a few years and see it in a much more favorable light.Why didn't Prometheus satisfy me the way Alien did upon seeing it the first time? I admit to disappointment at the derivative plot elements in Prometheus.  Alien was so original, with surprises coming every 5 minutes. On the other hand, Alien was a science fiction horror movie--no big questions asked or answered. Prometheus, like 2001, asks the greatest question of all--how did it all begin? Prometheus does work as a prequel, in that we do learn how the alien creatures originated. To succeed as a prequel, there had to be references taking us back to Alien, though some of these were a little ham-fisted.I am left feeling much like I did at the end of The Empire Strikes Back, another film that good as it is, sets the viewer up for a sequel. I am hoping Ridley Scott finds the money to fund another film, one that doesn't need the alien creature at all to move forward the journey of Dr Shaw and David to find the origin of life. I am like Shaw--I will continue to believe what I believe no matter what Scott comes up with--but I think I will enjoy the discussion.",4,Great?

1476406,A3CZVZ35U5F96H,B005LAIHXQ,T. Kucukyumuk,"[11, 27]","This is probably the greatest disappointment of the year, if not the decade. Building up hype is a risky game. When you fall; you fall from a really high place. Ridley Scott, the legendary director; the man who gave us the Alien in the first place has done just that. He failed miserably.I do not want to ruin anybody's experience so there are no spoilers here. I just want to share why I am so unhappy with it.Prometheus tries to be too many things and fails at everything it tries to do.Visually it is truly stunning and beautiful. But that's all. Even Avatar had a better and more coherent story. At least it had some characters that were not one-dimensional.Unfortunately, it is not possible to isolate Prometheus from the Alien series and treat it as a stand-alone movie as some are advising us to do. (not that it would save it from being a mediocre film at best). There are too many references to the Alien franchise from the beginning till the end (oh, the horrible horrible end). Prometheus is meant to be a prequel whatever people may say.First of all, with its glorious target of tying everything together, this movie should have been much longer. Diffeent stories and ideas fly from every direction and are simply left there lying untouched as they crash and burn. Mr. Scott, who had shown great mastery in the Alien by not giving too much information and keeping the details to the minimum necessity level has done the opposite here. And this is one of the basic reasons the film fails. There are too many things happening and you don't have the time to absorb them. You never feel immersed. You never feel you are there with the crew. You are not scared. You don't even care when they die.One could have left the movie theater feeling a bit satisfied if at least a few things had made sense. But that, unfortunately, does not happen either.There are movies, where I leave my brain outside so that my intelligence is not insulted. But then, Prometheus claims not to be this kind of a movie. It asks the grandest of questions: Where do we come from? Why? So, is it an intelligent movie? No.Alien was almost philosophical. It was slow. It had this sinister atmosphere which started with the opening scene and the haunting music. And it ended with the same note. There is no suspense, no claustrophobia in Prometheus. No atmosphere at all.With Aliens, we had more action than brains. And we chose not to see the plot holes because the action was so good. I still think Aliens is the best action movie ever. Prometheus doesn't even come close to Aliens.So, where does this leave us? If another director had tackled these questions without trying to tie all the loose ends with one single knot to one of the greatest movies of all time, I could have said: Good effort but mediocre result.When Ridley Scott kills off such a good idea and almost ruins Alien for me; then I say this is unacceptable.Extended review 11/06/2012:Please be warned, there be SPOILERS FROM THIS POINT ONWARDS.Having gone through reading more of the positive reviews (and being rather disturbed by the one who called anyone with a negative review as retarded) I thought may be I should share my problems with the movie more openly. If there is anyone who can make some explanation about the below problems I would be most indebted.1. Why would an intelligent humanoid extraterrestrial decide to destroy himself to create life on Earth? Is there no better way? And the Earth looks quite developed at that time. Are all Earthlings their children or is it only us?2. Why would there be a map on Earth for a military base that was meant to destroy Earth? If it was not meant for us why did so many civilizations know about it?3. When you go exploring a planet that may hold the key to one of the greatest questions ever asked do you only take a ragtag band of few scientists?4. How does a geologist who has ""dogs"" that can map an entire structure, get lost in the same structure?5. How does an android know the language of an advanced civilization without prior contact with that civilization?6. Why would there be a 3D recording of what happened to the ""soldiers"" 2000 years ago? How did David know which sequence would start the recording?7. Having seen there is (or was)  something deadly in the structure that killed members of  a more advanced civilization - how can scientists be so ignorant to open doors or touch anything in that structure before thoroughly testing everything?8. Following the same line of thought, how could a biologist be stupid enough to try touching a new life form that has suddenly appeared out of the blue?9. How can a ship's captain be so uncaring about his crew when they are stuck inside an unkown structure with a potential reading from an undetermined lifeform?10. Why would a very advanced race create deadly creatures that need other creatures' wombs to reproduce, as weapons of mass destruction? Wouldn't a specific virus be a better solution? Who would be cleaning up those pests after the attack? Obviously even the Engineers have a problem with controlling these ""weapons"". And yet they keep thousands of cylinders ready to be deployed on their ships.11. We know the xenomorph has an accelerated growth rate and we know it grew to a considerable size quickly in Alien (I always assumed it ate a lot of rats). However, the one that Shaw got out of her body had no food available to it. Yet it was enormous within a few hours. How?12. For me one of the worst scenes was the ending where we see a proto-xenomorph being born. There we see a reference to the horrible AVP: Requiem. It would appear that the xenomorph evolves by taking genes from its host and by creating something else. If so, why didn't we observe the same behavior with human hosts? The proto-xenomorph is born from the body of the Engineer, having obviously evolved further from the white octpussy thingy that grew in Shaw's womb. Yet in all Alien movies humans have been used as hosts but we see no such result (except on Alien 4 where Ripley herself is a genetic mashup of human and xenomorph).I may have made wrong observations or may have reached wrong conclusions. After all, I watched Prometheus only once. I have watched Alien and Aliens may be 20 times each. But these points bugged me and caused me to dislike this movie (and I did want to love it).

Cinematographically, handled with the usual deftness and aplomb that one would expect from Ridley Scott; though there are a few things that I thought were goofy (**POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT** notably the escape scene of certain character having had a certain surgical procedure was particularly ridiculous and coulda/shoulda been at least 'scified' into a semblance of believability).

It seems odd right off the bat because the paintings and/or etchings are just stick figures any mongoloid would draw pointing to the sky with a couple of circles that, I suppose, represent this moon/planet.This is where civilization started, but the creators aren't very nice and, from what I could gather, they have created so many terrifying species that nobody can keep track of them all.  You have worms, snakes, lizards, guys who look like the character Powder, squids, and zombies.  There's horrifying black ink, eggs that glow, mosaics that morph, hollow structures with scary-Crazy Horse size skulls carved into them, decapitated bodies, and epic dust storms.  I think Ridley Scott wants us to think that the creators are on a plot to destroy mankind and this must be the case because the pretty archeologist says so even though she just went through an incredible surgery on her abdomen (she's a quick healer, folks).It's really a complete and total mess and it was difficult for this viewer to truly know exactly what was going on because there are so many different creatures/alien forms to keep track of.  The zombie bit didn't make a lick of sense to me and I was just hopin' Charlize Theron would just torch everyone (including herself, the crew and myself), but at least she got run over by a spaceship.I mean, man...man, I...I'm trying to remember a collection of dumber characters assembled in one film.  These top of the line scientists embark on a field trip of the dumbest decision making ever captured on film and it's hard to even attempt to enjoy a movie/story when there is so much cerebral floundering taking place.  At least the majority of them get killed, I guess.  Sometimes the dumb really deserve that.  I mean, when your dumb-as-hell neighbor has his garbage disposal running and drops two kernels of Orville Redenbachers into it and then thrusts his arm down there, do you really feel sorry for him?  Of course you don't.  Don't pretend that you do!Adding insult to injury, the android in the movie looks like Michael Score from A Flock Of Seagulls.

Not because they were good FX, just because they had some. (FYI - you can't give 0 stars). As other reviews have noted there isn't any science in their fiction. The tie in to the Alien movie(s) is really weak. What really bugged me was when the girl that did a caesarian to extract the alien and then hops off the table and runs down the hall. I took my wife 24 hours before she could stand up. I really laughed my A_ _ off of this. I guess the script for this movie must have taken say 10 minutes to write. It is obviously totally derivative of ""Aliens"", with more special effects, less story. Same spaceship on dubious company business, same robot as key perpetrator of said company business, same deserted planet, same dormant aliens waiting for dumb earthlings, same plans to decimate Earth, same baseball cap to prepare for the ultimate heroic sacrifice. Big change this time is that the spaceship lands in a direct line to the buried spaceships/aliens via a conveniently built road. The actors are a very mixed bag - Noomi Rapace is hard to reconcile as the mesmeric, energetic lead in ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" - her acting in ""Prometheus"" is wooden to the nth degree and her facial features are reminiscent of someone post root canal - the Novocain look. And her hair? How the remaining actors were able keep a straight face throughout is a mystery. And she was ready to jump into bed with the first BBMF. Utter drivel with sub-themes of religion and immortality - oh and the master race. I've seen Tom and Jerry cartoons that have better and more logical dialog - and by that yardstick - Homer Simpson is a thoughtful genius. This movie is yet another sign of the decline of Western culture, aided and abetted by Hollywood greed. The visual effects were stunning in Blu-Ray, but the story went nowhere - pointless is one descriptive word that springs to mind; another is contrived. The Prometheus plot is what I would expect from a low budget horror movie - this one just has better special effects. Perhaps the disappointment that the movie ended before the story was over stems from a less than subtle attempt to set the stage for a sequel? If that is the case, the effective cost of this entertainment is at least double - not an acceptable proposition - a movie must stand on its own, or be marketed as a series. I could not identify with any of the characters.

1476437,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B005LAIHXQ,Tsuyoshi,"[6, 15]","""Prometheus"" is a Ridley Scott sci-fi action movie, which means it has amazing cinematography and tough heroines. If you are looking for them, you will not be disappointed. But how about the story? Please don't expect an intelligent and intricate screenplay here because ""Prometheus,"" an indirect prequel to the ""Alien"" franchise, is a typical case of Hollywood blockbuster full of sound and fury, a visual extravaganza with so many big plot holes.Set in 2093, an expedition team of scientists and experts including an archaeologist Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) is sent on a mission to the moon LV-223. This is a trillion-dollar project financed by the Weyland Corporation (the CEO Peter Weyland is played by a nearly unrecognizable Guy Pearce), to discover the ""Engineers"" and secrets about the origin of the humans.The film starts promisingly, benefitting the veteran director's assured control of scenes, but as the story of ""Prometheus"" (script penned by Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof) unfolds, you may have a very strong feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. While the film's main theme is very ambitious, each set-piece looks as if borrowed from some other sci-fi films including Ridley Scott's own works.Michael Fassbender plays an android David. Though Fassbender as always delivers a solid performance, the android's decision making is random and sometimes unaccountable. The way he speaks reminds us of HAL9000, but Fassbender's character behaves more illogically than the computer of ""2001: A Space Odyssey.""

1476438,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B005LAIHXQ,Turfseer,"[13, 27]","***This review may contain spoilers***No matter how much he and his fellow scenarists deny it, Ridley Scott's 'Prometheus' is very much a souped-up update of Scott's 'classic' 1979 sci-fi horror show, 'Alien'. The film begins with a cryptic scene set during pre-historic times when a space traveler (who looks like a muscle-bound 'Mr. Clean' with pasty skin) drinks a dark liquid concoction that causes him to disintegrate. We find out later, that quite incredibly, the traveler's disintegration causes a biogenetic chain reaction, which is responsible for the origin of life on earth.Cut to 2089. Archaeologist couple, Elizabeth Shaw and Charlie Holloway, make a new discovery of an ancient cave drawing that's similar to other cave drawings already discovered, pointing to a distant moon where Mr. Clean might have come from (these humanoids are dubbed 'Engineers'). Cut to the Prometheus, a giant spaceship financed by multi-billionaire Peter Weyland, CEO of the Weyland Corporation. Weyland is played by Guy Pearce, made up to look like a senior on his last legs (despite a ton of prosthetics, the make-up department ends up managing to turn Weyland into a clone of Biff Tanner from 'Back to the Future, Part 2').Weyland gives the Prometheus crew a pep talk after they wake up from suspended animation, except he's a hologram. We're told by Vickers (Charlize Theron) that Weyland had a few weeks to live before the Prometheus took off but it turns out that he's been in stasis in private quarters, off limits to the rest of the crew. Weyland can't accept the idea that he's soon going to kick the bucket and hopes that the Engineers will restore his youth. Boy is he in for a big surprise!Before the ship arrives at its destination, David the Android house sits while crew members sleep in their pea pods. David, designed by Weyland, has a mind of his own and a nice British accent to boot. He keeps himself busy before the crew wakes up by studying thousands of obscure languages and watching old movies. For some reason, David doesn't seem to be programmed to obey orders and ends up digging around for clues by himself once the crew lands on the moon.Despite all the neat special effects, 'Prometheus' is saddled with one clich&eacute;d character after another. Holloway, the archaeologist leader, is the skeptical scientist who's contrasted with his lover Shaw, the 'believer', who is still bent on finding out the 'meaning of life' at film's end. Holloway is virtual cannon fodder after David infects him with the dark liquid seen earlier. Holloway proves to be thoroughly expendable when he becomes a virtual Zombie and Vickers must torch him to death with a flamethrower, to prevent him from getting back on the ship. Theron's Vickers, who turns out to be Weyland's daughter, has no interest in alien first contact and is a most unlikeable, one dimensional villain. Like Holloway, she's easily disposed of when she's crushed by the Engineer's disabled ship, during the denouement.The bulk of the action takes inside a giant cave which turns out to be the Engineer's spaceship. Crew members Milburn and Fifield, decide to run back to the Prometheus after they're spooked by all the bad vibes inside the cave. As there is no discipline amongst the crew members, they're allowed to abandon their colleagues and promptly end up getting lost. Of course they're the first ones to be dispatched by the alien monsters, squid like creatures completely reminiscent of Scott's '79 'frightfest'.Scott must have reasoned that audiences today still want a taste of that old 'Alien' magic, so Milburn and Fifields' demise must go the usual route of having the creature's tentacles reach inside the victims' bodies (through the mouth) and then having them subsequently disemboweled from the 'inside out'. But wait! Scott must up the 'ante' and he does so by having Shaw impregnated by an infected Holloway. Since she's now got an alien embryo in her belly, she's informed by David that she's now three months pregnant after one day! Not to worry! Set your self-service 2093 surgery machine on automatic pilot and let the device remove the nasty creature for you. Just make sure you give yourself enough shots of morphine, or whatever pain-killer does the trick!It turns out that David has discovered that one of the Engineers is still alive, inside one of those pea pods inside the cave. When they wake him up, the crew members who went back into cave (including Weyland), have to deal with the humanoid's 'anger management' problem, which they didn't count on. Everyone is killed and David gets his head ripped off (don't worry, he's somehow still able to think, talk and communicate!).It's not enough for the director to channel 'Alien' but why not a dose of 'Alien vs. Predator' while you're at it? That's essentially happens when the surviving bad-guy Engineer takes on the giant squid-like Alien, in a fight to the death struggle. Guess who wins?Leave it to Shaw (the aforementioned true believer), to want to go off to distant places, in an attempt to extract an explanation from the Engineers, who seemingly gave humans life but then changed their minds. As Shaw jets off with the help of David, one wonders why Shaw seems to ignore all the unpleasantness associated with her first encounter with the surviving Engineer. Is there any reason why she wouldn't get her head ripped off, during a second encounter with these baddies?If you're going to see 'Prometheus', it's for the special effects and not the characters. There's actually some neat visuals in this film, including a wondrous sandstorm and a star map highlighting Earth. But in the end, most of this stuff we've seen before. One thing I did learn from 'Promethesus' is that inside every giant squid-like alien, is one hell of an adorable gargoyle calling the shots!",2,"Inside every giant squid-like alien, is one hell of an

I originally bought the 2-disc version and it is pretty good, with extras and Director commentary track, plus the Weyland Files (with a lengthy ""TED"" speech by a young Weyland (in 2023 during his youth)), all very interesting. The deleted scenes and alternates definitely clear up most of the plot holes for me. The theatrical release kind of made me feel angry, cheated, which now seems to have been due to over-editing. Bad editor! Bad!  The 4-disc set is the one to get. I give the 2-disc set 4 stars.However, I did have a lot of trouble getting the blu-ray disc to work properly on my Sony BD player. First ever BD fail. Menus screwing up, film freezing, even a data error mid-film! Seems to work properly now after I updated the firmware--which i had never done before, had never needed to. This, IMO, is due to crappy BD authoring, not my Sony player. But whatever....is film is compelling enough that I was willing to purchase it twice AND do a firmware update. Thats how much i enjoyed it. Theatrical release: 2 stars for plot fail.[Addendum]: While watching a second time, normal BD disc, with commentary, data corruption began at about 1 hour into the film, with video artifacts. Did not happen with the standard audio track. Upon viewing BD stats, the film is pushing 35-40Mbps, which i have never seen before in a film. I do not think my Sony olayer can handle it. Clearly not a disc error, but data error rendering the film (decoding). If i restart the BD player, then FFW to the scene, it doesnt corrupt. Seems to happen due to overheating or something after playing for a while? I dont know if this is a flaw or hardware issue with my Sony player (BDP-S360), never before had any issues with any other film. Firmware update apparently didnt help. Perhaps newer players do not have such issues but I thought BD was standardized.Due to all of the aforementioned issues, i must reduce my rating to 3 stars due to fails at every turn. this film seems to not want to be watched and enjoyed.",3,Over-edited theatrical release--blu-ray makes more sense,1350172800,"10 14, 2012",2012,2142,"['am', 'giving', 'blu-ray', 'collector', 'edition', '4', 'discs', '5', 'stars', 'excellent', '4th', 'disc', 'containing', 'documentary', 'film', 'extras', 'originally', 'bought', '2-disc', 'version', 'pretty', 'good', 'extras', 'Director', 'commentary', 'track', 'Weyland', 'Files', 'lengthy', 'TED', 'speech', 'young', 'Weyland', '2023', 'youth', 'very', 'interesting', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'definitely', 'clear', 'most', 'plot', 'holes', 'theatrical', 'release', 'kind', 'made', 'feel', 'angry', 'cheated', 'now', 'have', 'been', 'due', 'over-editing', 'Bad', 'editor', 'Bad', '4-disc', 'set', 'one', 'get', 'give', '2-disc', 'set', '4', 'stars.However', 'did', 'have', 'lot', 'trouble', 'getting', 'blu-ray', 'disc', 'work', 'properly', 'Sony', 'BD', 'player', 'First', 'ever', 'BD', 'fail', 'screwing', 'up', 'film', 'freezing', 'even', 'data', 'error', 'mid-film', 'Seems', 'work', 'properly', 'now', 'updated', 'firmware', 'i', 'had', 'never', 'done', 'before', 'had', 'never', 'needed', 'IMO', 'due', 'crappy', 'BD', 'authoring', 'not', 'Sony', 'player', '.is', 'film', 'compelling', 'was', 'willing', 'purchase', 'twice', 'AND', 'do', 'firmware', 'update', 'Thats', 'how', 'much', 'i', 'enjoyed', 'Theatrical', 'release', '2', 'stars', 'plot', 'fail', 'Addendum', ']', 'watching', 'second', 'time', 'normal', 'BD', 'disc', 'commentary', 'data', 'corruption', 'began', '1', 'hour', 'film', 'video', 'artifacts', 'Did', 'not', 'happen', 'standard', 'audio', 'track', 'viewing', 'BD', 'stats', 'film', 'pushing', '35-40Mbps', 'i', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'Sony', 'olayer', 'can', 'handle', 'Clearly', 'not', 'disc', 'error', 'data', 'error', 'rendering', 'film', 'decoding', 'i', 'restart', 'BD', 'player', 'then', 'FFW', 'scene', 'corrupt', 'Seems', 'happen', 'due', 'overheating', 'something', 'playing', 'while', 'dont', 'know', 'flaw', 'hardware', 'issue', 'Sony', 'player', 'BDP-S360', 'never', 'before', 'had', 'issues', 'other', 'film', 'Firmware', 'update', 'apparently', 'didnt', 'help', 'Perhaps', 'newer', 'players', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'such', 'issues', 'thought', 'BD', 'was', 'standardized.Due', 'aforementioned', 'issues', 'i', 'must', 'reduce', 'rating', '3', 'stars', 'due', 'fails', 'turn', 'film', 'not', 'want', 'be', 'watched', 'enjoyed']",N/A

But it does not look as good as the original, and given how the original looked in 79, this is one is downright lame.The reasons for why the first movie was good have been talked about for decades and it had allot to do with not doing the wrong things. all of which he does here.The aliens are now a dime a dozen, all different. Then you have one small alien somewho growing huge by staying in an ER room devoid of organic matter. There is not logic to the aliens, they are tiny, huge, snake like, octopus like, or microbes in slime. then the microbes become worms in the eye. Then a woman gets impregnated by the carier of the eye worms, with a different kind of alien. however, once that alien is removed she is healthy and has no eye worms. and so on.Worst of all, the human-aliens, who appear to be made out of wax, are seen running for their lives toward the familiar shaped pods full of aliens that are presumably their version of weapons of mass destruction. Not away from, but toward what they know to be death.Then you have many characters that have no function what so ever, like the Charlie Theron character, why was she there? Or weyland? He was so predictable, anybody saw that coming.What bothers me most is that lack of anything inovative. The aliens are much much more conventional und unsurprising than H.R.Gigers masterpiece. you will never better giger in this, so stick with it! The look of the ship was more bland und like ""ehh, spaceship"" than the old one.And the sexiness level was turned down. There is less new ground, less chances taken, here also with regards to the female cast. Who here will pretend he does not remember the scene in the first movie, where weaver puts on that space suit. This was more than 30 years ago. In this flick you got doctors who do not take of their undies, even while having mafor surgery.If this was NOT scott, and not alien, this would movie would be just another sci fi.However, there are no where near enough sci fi, and so I am glad they made it. Its better than nothing. But it also proves an old theory: good movie are LUCK, not the director. Exception may have been Lawrence's david lean.The movie is made watchable by Fassbender, the visiuals, and the references to Lawrence of arabia. My favorite movie of all time and one that shows how to do it right.Finally, there is bit of a scandal here in the news about how amazon scews its reviews systematically to push good ratings. and it is true that any rating that dislike a product or movie gets massive dings here. But I loved Alien, and this is movie is almost lazy in its attempt to cash in on that. Though, obviously, we have had allot worse with Indiana Jones, Tron, and the Horror that are the newer star wars flicks.",2,"Pretty Images, plot holes everywhere, nothing new, average",1345852800,"08 25, 2012",2012,2928,"['nothing', 'short', 'sad', 'Scott', 'churned', 'out', 'such', 'normal', 'hollywood', 'version', 'Alien.Everything', 'stock', 'predictable', 'making', 'movie', 'actually', 'boring', 'times.Yes', 'great', 'not', 'look', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'given', 'how', 'original', 'looked', '79', 'one', 'downright', 'lame.The', 'reasons', 'why', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'have', 'been', 'talked', 'decades', 'had', 'allot', 'do', 'not', 'doing', 'wrong', 'things', 'here.The', 'aliens', 'are', 'now', 'dime', 'dozen', 'different', 'Then', 'have', 'one', 'small', 'alien', 'somewho', 'growing', 'huge', 'staying', 'ER', 'room', 'devoid', 'organic', 'matter', 'not', 'logic', 'aliens', 'are', 'tiny', 'huge', 'snake', 'octopus', 'microbes', 'slime', 'then', 'microbes', 'become', 'worms', 'eye', 'Then', 'woman', 'impregnated', 'carier', 'eye', 'worms', 'different', 'kind', 'alien', 'however', 'once', 'alien', 'removed', 'healthy', 'eye', 'worms', 'so', 'on.Worst', 'human-aliens', 'who', 'appear', 'be', 'made', 'wax', 'are', 'seen', 'running', 'lives', 'familiar', 'shaped', 'pods', 'full', 'aliens', 'are', 'presumably', 'version', 'weapons', 'mass', 'destruction', 'Not', 'away', 'what', 'know', 'be', 'death.Then', 'have', 'many', 'characters', 'have', 'function', 'what', 'so', 'ever', 'Charlie', 'Theron', 'character', 'why', 'was', 'there', 'weyland', 'was', 'so', 'predictable', 'anybody', 'saw', 'coming.What', 'bothers', 'most', 'lack', 'anything', 'inovative', 'aliens', 'are', 'much', 'much', 'more', 'conventional', 'unsurprising', 'H.R.Gigers', 'masterpiece', 'will', 'never', 'better', 'giger', 'so', 'stick', 'look', 'ship', 'was', 'more', 'bland', 'und', 'ehh', 'spaceship', 'old', 'one.And', 'sexiness', 'level', 'was', 'turned', 'down', 'less', 'new', 'ground', 'less', 'chances', 'taken', 'here', 'also', 'regards', 'female', 'cast', 'Who', 'here', 'will', 'pretend', 'not', 'remember', 'scene', 'first', 'movie', 'where', 'weaver', 'space', 'suit', 'was', 'more', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'flick', 'got', 'doctors', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'take', 'undies', 'even', 'having', 'mafor', 'surgery.If', 'was', 'NOT', 'scott', 'not', 'alien', 'would', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'sci', 'fi.However', 'are', 'where', 'near', 'enough', 'sci', 'fi', 'so', 'am', 'glad', 'made', 'better', 'nothing', 'also', 'old', 'theory', 'good', 'movie', 'are', 'LUCK', 'not', 'director', 'Exception', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'Lawrence', 'david', 'lean.The', 'movie', 'made', 'watchable', 'Fassbender', 'visiuals', 'references', 'Lawrence', 'arabia', 'favorite', 'movie', 'time', 'one', 'how', 'do', 'right.Finally', 'bit', 'scandal', 'here', 'news', 'how', 'amazon', 'reviews', 'systematically', 'push', 'good', 'ratings', 'true', 'rating', 'product', 'movie', 'massive', 'dings', 'here', 'loved', 'Alien', 'movie', 'almost', 'lazy', 'attempt', 'cash', 'Though', 'obviously', 'have', 'had', 'allot', 'worse', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'Tron', 'Horror', 'are', 'newer', 'star', 'wars', 'flicks']",N/A
1476449,A35L2E8M7S59MQ,B005LAIHXQ,V. Berk,"[15, 25]","Who created us?That is perhaps one of the greatest questions ever asked by mankind and is the driving idea at the center of Ridley Scott's new science-fiction adventure Prometheus, the first entry of a proposed trilogy from the celebrated British director who brought us ALIEN, and Blade Runner. This story detailing a possible origin of mankind follows journey of a research team traveling in a spaceship years away from home in search of their creators. Prometheus is a fantastic looking movie set in the same fictional universe as Ridley Scott's sci-fi/horror classic ALIEN (1979) and uses the mythology suggested by Dan O'Bannon's original script to fashion an entirely new sci-fi adventure.Prometheus is the name of a trillion dollar research vessel created by Weyland Industries. A science team along with an assorted group of professionals has been recruited to find a planet that has been depicted in numerous cave paintings back on earth. Dr Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace, Sweden's original Girl with the Dragon Tattoo [2009]) , and her lover Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshal Green) leads the science team under the critical, cold gaze of Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron). It takes over two years for the Prometheus to reach LV-223, during which the human crew is watched over by David 8 (Michael Fassbender), a highly advanced robotic organism programmed to simulate human life. Once they arrive on LV-223 they discover a structure left behind by the previous inhabitants. There Shaw and her science team searches for the key to mankind's creation, but instead finds a weapon with the potential of destroying all life on Earth.The break out character of the movie is Michael Fassbender as David 8. We meet David going about his daily routines while the rest of the crew is asleep in one of the best scenes the movie offers in ways of character development. David eats, watches over the crew, plays basketball by himself, learns new languages, and memorizes lines from his favorite movie, Lawrence of Arabia. Here's how I'd descrive this character: Imagine if HAL9000 from 2001: A Space Odyssey could take human form; if you could see him actually grappling and occasionally hinting at signs of having developed genuine emotions. That is David 8.As Elizabeth Shaw Noomi Rapace's first leading role in an English-language movie begins shaky, but by the end of the movie she's hit her stride, bringing Elizabeth Shaw to life. Her performance lacks the subtle nuance of her portrayal of Lisbeth Salander in the original Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, but it does pack a punch. By the end of the film she does firmly step into her action heroine shoes.A character I liked that not many people talk about as much is the Prometheus's Captain Janek, an underutilized character who had more potential than the movie allowed him. He starts off as an outsider to the worlds of Shaw, Vickers ,and the expedition, but by the end has completely devoted himself to it.Ridley Scott's stylish direction played a huge part in cementing ALIEN and Blade Runner as two of the movie world's science-fiction masterpieces and there is no doubt that Prometheus is a great looking movie. When Ridley Scott does science-fiction he knows how to make it look right, and that still holds true thirty years after Blade Runner. The full-scale sets are fantastic, there are plenty of great special effects. You shouldn't wait to see this movie on your home television: it needs to be seen on a big screen.That brings me to 3D. I saw this movie in IMAX 3D, and it is one of the best movies I've seen in 3D...That being said I still fail to see why on earth anyone cares about 3D. I've given Coraline, Avatar, TRON: Legacy, Hugo, and Prometheus a fair chance to dazzle me with this recent development in price raising- I mean exciting technology. These are some of the best movies to see 3D in, and yes they look good, but all of them I've also enjoyed just as much, if not better in 2D. If you really are obsessed with 3D then yes, knock yourself out, you're going to have a blast. But, if you're like me and still aren't sold on 3D this movie will not be an eye opener.The most important thing one needs to understand before sitting down for Ridley Scott's Prometheus: this is NOT an Alien movie. It takes place in the same universe as Alien, has visual elements of Alien, has locations and even the fledgling evolutionary stage of what will become the monsters of the 1979 classic, but alone Prometheus is not a straight-up ALIEN prequel. Prometheus is a standalone science-fiction adventure, and it is one that in my humble opinion works extraordinarily well. Ridley Scott announced he intends Prometheus to be the first part of a science-fiction trilogy set within the Alien universe. That means you should expect H.R. Giger's infamous monsters to be leaping around. This movie is about the creation of man, with the creation of what ultimately becomes the xenomorphs by the time the Nostromo arrives at LV-426 in the first Alien movie.Do not go into Prometheus expecting a direct ALIEN prequel.I feel I need to clarify that Prometheus is not an Alien movie because too many disappointed, annoyed, or downright angered reviewers are coming down hard on Prometheus for not filling the shows, or delivering the same goods of Ridley Scott's 1979 classic. To go in expecting another Alien movie would be to set yourself up for disappointment. This is Prometheus, part 1 of a new science fiction trilogy. It is not Ridley Scott's ALIEN 2 Electric Boogaloo.At times Prometheus is a bit in over its head with the scope of its ambition, but at the same time I love this idea of searching for a possible extra-terrestrial root to man's DNA. Sure, the plot has been done several times in books, but only a few times in movies, and I honestly feel Prometheus has done a better job of it than does other films.Prometheus isn't ALIEN but it is a damn good first step for what could be a great new series. For what it's worth: I loved Prometheus. Even with its flaws.Here's to the hopes of a brilliant trilogy from Sir Ridley Scott!",5,"""Big things have small beginnings.""- Great start to a new series",1339200000,"06 9, 2012",2012,6096,"['Who',

In that regard I would rank it third in the series behind the original Alien and the follow up Aliens, but ahead of Alien 3.The production quality is strong, though I'm not a fan of 3D. At this time I still find it clumsy and clunky to always have to wear the glasses and readjust them on my face through out a movie. I look forward to the eventual day when 3D movies will be viewed without glasses at all.

1476462,A4YXKE5F62II8,B005LAIHXQ,Visual Bureau,"[0, 1]","""Without being familiar with Alien, the initial reaction I received at my first midnight screening for this film was well worth it. It is the kind of film that leaves the audience boggling with questions and it all works well than probably AvP (Alien v. Predator).The acting was prime especially from Rapace and Fassbender. Even when some may view David as cold, it is all integral paying as a homage to HAL-9000 (2001) and his performance serves as a reminder of the future and its dependence of technology (no hints/spoiler but he is empty in one part). The somewhat minimal special effects, reasonable time length, Oscar-level cinematography, and scenery is phenomenal, better than Avatar (which ain't all that good/look over the Cameron hand-kissing hype) especially when considering everything is centrally located to one location (often touching on minimalist points than the extravagant and grand). The opening has an ethereal quality about it and its calming yet tense soundtrack all complements the mood of the film. The idea that it is a horror is quite contradictory to the film's particular core- the idea of space exploration and research into new life and signifies itself as a human futuristic thriller about the importance of ideas and peril in the face of scientific discovery. It follows along the lines of other great films, but not to the level of celebration by critics, like Moon (neat, cerebral film from David Bowie's son- Duncan Jones), The Island of Dr. Moreau, Pandorum (which is very similar), and Fantastic Planet (a classic but not-very-good animated fantasy.In regards to particular criticisms, the story is grand but slightly choppy involving the man behind the spaceship that Charlize Theron finds is hostile as well as the troubling figure known as The Engineer who has a rather faint significance here beginning and ending. The film does lack a sense of a stronger foundation in the opening but is forgiven with the insight into discovery of a new planet and the R rating was particularly too high for the film's rather infrequent yet disturbing images and the film feels altogether tamer compared to many R-rated films and even PG-13 films like Casino Royale and Taken.A newer notice is at stake with the many haters-and-lovers who view Prometheus in a mixed fashion. The film as a whole is more positive in terms of film criticism when you consider viewing it from a perspective that does not have much familiarity with the Alien franchise and/or science-fiction. Patience is best a virtue when viewing a film that is as contemplative and gradually tense as Prometheus.

1476467,A3DUE5E90OLJRL,B005LAIHXQ,"w ""aenima3174""","[12, 25]","I think people have this propensity to pick apart and complain about every minute and somewhat insignificant plot detail that doesn't spell out exactly what they are seeing, while simultaneously failing to see the overall picture and vision. This movie answered some big questions in my mind that began with Alien, if not in exact detail, they were eluded to enough to hopefully get the bigger picture if and when a sequel is filmed. I think in part that was the point, to begin to uncover some of the answers, but allow more questions to be answered in the future. Maybe some won't, who knows. Either way, I had the opposite reaction of people who didn't like it, where I was totally pulled into the fllm and from start to end tried to make connections to start to piece together the entire story. From Prometheus you realize the Alien story is more epic than you would have imagined, and I hope it will continue because it has taken the story in a new direction similar to what the new Star Trek did for that series. Alient 3 and 4 were watchable, but kind of ridiculous and disappointing at the same time. I'd rather watch A v P. People who don't like this movie might have also thought Avatar or Independence Day were great sci-fi films. Wait.. I'm getting a flashback; Will Smith punching out a huge alien and not breaking his frail hand on it's massive helmet, Bill Pullman's here comes America to save the world again speech, and Avatar's high school-like, over-emotional chosen one alien love story. Hut hut... hike! Ugh. Maybe I would have liked Avatar better if I hadn't seen it in 3d. Those glasses are terrible, and then when I took them off because I couldn't stand keeping them on my face, I realized they should probably come with a free packet of dramamine. Anyway. I'd say if you like darker, more 'realistic' sci-fi movies like Pandorum, Moon, The Thing ('82), or the original Alien/Aliens then you'll love this. I saw a comment about there being a bunch of insignificant people on the team which created weak characters - I think this was true of Aliens, where the marine team was larger until the core 'team' went into the installation and you care that they made it or not. In another comment someone said they didn't care at all about the main characters, but in Alien there wasn't a lot of backstory given about each person either. Prometheus was a different story with different characters, some of which you weren't supposed to like. I personally thought it was a great movie that if given a chance, will ignite the imagination, and at the same time loosely tie together the Alien/Aliens movies. Its 'message', if there is one, is much deeper and more haunting than the average sci-fi charater-undeveloped effect-fest that works well for the person that searches for the true answers to understanding the universe, whatever they may be.

Although flawed ""Prometheus"" does have merit. You can read all the pro (5 star) and con (1 star)reviews to determine the brilliance or stupidity of this film.I'd argue that eventually ""Prometheus"" may, like ""Blade Runner"", see its reptutation rise with time. Either way, ""Prometheus"" is an often stunning looking film from Scott and, in spite of its narrative flaws (the script does have issues), the larger-than-life production values certainly make the film appear impressive looking.You're mileage may vary but try and ignore the hype associated with the film and put your expectations aside. If you ignore both you may find the film enjoyable.The 3D Blu-ray disc looks positively stunning--Scott shows an instinctive feel for 3D--the director uses the process to impress with the gradeur of the film and not as a gimmick. The transfer looks brilliant with deep, inky blacks and an amazing amount of detail evident. During the starmap sequence in particular the 3D effect is positively stunning. Depth is remarkably strong throuhgout the presentation.The regular Blu-ray also looks stunning BUT some players are having some issues (Sony players for example even with the latest upgrade for firmware)with pixelation and cubing where the image breaks up. Usually this is an issue with the disc itself and I'm going to assume that it is in this case although it would be wise to make sure your firmware is up-to-date.The 3D four disc edition comes with a DVD of the film in addition to the 3D and 2D Blu presentation. All three discs have the commentary track and there are deleted/alternate scenes (some of which should have been kept in the film despite pacing issues as they explained the behavior of some characters and gave others additional depth).The fourth disc features a terrific, in depth documentary on the making of the film directed by Charles de Lauzirika. ""Furious Gods"" covers everything from the conception of the film (it began as an ""Alien"" prequel/reboot), changes to the script over time, production designs and changes to the look of the film as pre-production progressed to production. We get plenty of behind-the-scenes footage. At three hours it's a massive documentary that is equally as impressive as the film looks.We also get the ""viral"" videos made of a younger Weyland, information on the production of ""David"" the android and other bits and pieces (including a bit of text that ""suggests"" a link between ""Blade Runner"" and ""Prometheus"" --something that Damon Lindelof had in mind while writing the script but never made explicit).Although flawed with dumb behavior by characters, plot holes that, in this version, you could fly a spaceship through ""Prometheus"" still manages to be entertaining particularly if you set aside the expectations created by the hype associated with the film.",4,"Review for 3D 4 disc set--film looks stunning, documentary terrific--you're mileage may vary on the film itself",1339113600,"06 8, 2012",2012,2979,"['Ridley', 'Scott', 'wanted', 'make', 'film', 'asked', 'big', 'questions', 'same', 'time', 'could', 'be', 'tied', 'same', 'universe', 'pioneered', 'Alien', 'franchise', 'flawed', 'Prometheus', 'have', 'merit', 'can', 'read', 'pro', '5', 'star', 'con', '1', 'star', 'determine', 'brilliance', 'stupidity', 'film.I', ""'d"", 'argue', 'eventually', 'Prometheus', 'may', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'see', 'reptutation', 'rise', 'time', 'way', 'Prometheus', 'often', 'stunning', 'looking', 'film', 'Scott', 'spite', 'narrative', 'flaws', 'script', 'have', 'issues', 'larger-than-life', 'production', 'values', 'certainly', 'make', 'film', 'appear', 'impressive', 'looking.You', ""'re"", 'mileage', 'may', 'vary', 'try', 'ignore', 'hype', 'associated', 'film', 'put', 'expectations', 'aside', 'ignore', 'may', 'find', 'film', 'enjoyable.The', '3D', 'Blu-ray', 'disc', 'positively', 'stunning', 'Scott', 'instinctive', 'feel', '3D', 'director', 'process', 'impress', 'gradeur', 'film', 'not', 'gimmick', 'transfer', 'brilliant', 'deep', 'inky', 'blacks', 'amazing', 'amount', 'detail', 'evident', 'starmap', 'sequence', 'particular', '3D', 'effect', 'positively', 'stunning', 'Depth', 'remarkably', 'strong', 'presentation.The', 'regular', 'Blu-ray', 'also', 'stunning', 'BUT', 'players', 'are', 'having', 'issues', 'Sony', 'players', 'example', 'even', 'latest', 'upgrade', 'firmware', 'pixelation', 'cubing', 'where', 'image', 'up', 'Usually', 'issue', 'disc', ""'m"", 'going', 'assume', 'case', 'would', 'be', 'wise', 'make', 'sure', 'firmware', 'up-to-date.The', '3D', 'four', 'disc', 'edition', 'DVD', 'film', 'addition', '3D', '2D', 'Blu', 'presentation', 'three', 'discs', 'have', 'commentary', 'track', 'are', 'deleted/alternate', 'scenes', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'kept', 'film', 'pacing', 'issues', 'explained', 'behavior', 'characters', 'gave', 'others', 'additional', 'depth', '.The', 'fourth', 'disc', 'terrific', 'depth', 'documentary', 'making', 'film', 'directed', 'Charles', 'de', 'Lauzirika', 'Furious', 'Gods', 'covers', 'everything', 'conception', 'film', 'began', 'Alien', 'prequel/reboot', 'changes', 'script', 'time', 'production', 'designs', 'changes', 'look', 'film', 'pre-production', 'progressed', 'production', 'get', 'plenty', 'behind-the-scenes', 'footage', 'three', 'hours', 'massive', 'documentary', 'equally', 'as', 'impressive', 'film', 'looks.We', 'also', 'get', 'viral', 'videos', 'made', 'younger', 'Weyland', 'information', 'production', 'David', 'android', 'other', 'bits', 'pieces', 'including', 'bit', 'text', 'suggests', 'link', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'Prometheus', 'something', 'Damon', 'Lindelof', 'had', 'mind', 'writing', 'script', 'never', 'made', 'explicit', 'flawed', 'dumb', 'behavior', 'characters', 'plot', 'holes', 'version', 'could', 'fly', 'spaceship', 'Prometheus', 'still', 'be', 'entertaining', 'particularly', 'set', 'aside', 'expectations', 'created', 'hype', 'associated', 'film']",N/A

1476479,A1JV1FA7LCDDA3,B005LAIHXQ,Wendell Best,"[3, 6]","I knew beforehand that this movie was a prequel to the other alien movies, but thought that finding out how they came about would be interesting. I thought the plot was formulaic and the plot twists made me think the writers and producers just decided that instead of following the usual formula they would do a complete 180 on how the plot resolved itself which made a lot of the movie not make any sense at all.The movie started out with an alien dropped off on ancient Earth drinking a dark liquid that causes his DNA to rip apart into tiny pieces and he disintegrated and fell into the waterfall he was standing next to. This causes his DNA to merge with other DNA fragments in the water and leap ahead however many thousands upon thousands of years and we see two archeologists finding a cave painting with big aliens pointing to a star formation which is similar to drawings they found in six or so other cultures.  Kind of the typical alien calling card, ""Come see us when you figure things out and can travel across time and space.""So they travel to the star system, find a planet and several underground passageways that will later be revealed to be a ship. The team is the usual you expect from the Alien franchise, the company man(woman), the scientists, the warriors and the android who seems to be up to his own agenda. It's no surprise at this point that only one of the female scientists would survive just like the unstoppable Ripley. She also gets pregnant with an alien creature that gets removed in a gruesome way.  Apparently, the aliens that spawned the human race did it so they could use the same thing that killed the alien they left on earth to wipe out all life on Earth.The man who funded the mission reveals himself towards the end of the movie after having left a video message saying he was dead of old age by the time they arrived. This actually explains why the android was operating on his own, he was trying to find the aliens so they could ""fix"" the old man and give him eternal youth. Inexplicably, the alien they revive just starts roaring incoherently and killing everyone except for the lone female who escapes the ship just moments before the alien launches. A suicidal kamikaze attack using the ship they arrived in to ram the alien ship stops it from leaving the planet, but they jettison the luxury suite life pod moments before they kill hit.Now or lone survivor goes to the life pod and searches for supplies only to stop when she hears a noise. Amazingly, that little creepy crawly turned into a monstrous creepy crawly and the alien who is now pissed and looking for her appears and they begin to fight it out until she ""strategically"" opens the door to the monstrous creepy crawly and it kills the alien, basically by wrapping itself around the alien and shoving something in its mouth. Needless to say, the queen alien rips out of the dead alien's chest and gives that famous double teeth smile.The disembodied android head tells the last survivor that there is another ship which they use to leave the planet, but not to return to earth, no, they plan on finding the aliens home world to ask all the questions the audience is asking, such as, why did they create life on a planet just to destroy it with a biological weapon they nearly wiped the aliens that created it out? And why did we pay all this money for a movie that claimed it would reveal the beginnings of the aliens (okay, it did, it was an accident, really? A bunch of aliens want to kill us and ""accidentally"" start the series of events that creates the aliens) then left us with another unanswered question that will most likely go unanswered?I was disappointed, if anything the android that was deciphering the door locks and knew how to control the ship could at least have found the time to read the alien captains log and said something like, ""We are getting tired of visiting Earth, last time we were there we were mistaken for albino basketball players and paid too much for coffee from a place called Starbucks.

1476485,A15U46ZENEHGTH,B005LAIHXQ,Wicked_Smaht,"[1, 3]","Sometimes I walk into a movie with high hopes and I'm profoundly disappointed (Green Lantern) and sometimes I walk into movies with low expectations and am pleasantly surprised (X-Men: First Class), but every so often, I walk into a movie knowing exactly what to expect and the film delivers exactly that. Prometheus is one of those movies, but not in a good way. As a Ridley Scott fan, I expected this movie to have stunning visuals and in that, the film does not disappoint. The man is clearly a visual storyteller and all of his films (whether they be his duds or his best work) are always visually compelling. As an Alien franchise fan, I expected any continuation of the series (whether it's the original series, the AvP films or this tangent of a film) to subscribe to the law of diminishing returns and in that, this film meets that expectation fully. As a person who's learned to become wary of any project Damon Lindelof is involved in, this movie certainly proves its point as to why it's wise to check the fine print in the credits...It's easy to find faults with the film (as several reviewers have already pointed out), but I feel like the most disappointing aspect of the film is that it portends to be a return to a classic sci-fi film that explores the bigger mysteries of life cocooned inside a thrilling space adventure. However, the film ultimately resigns itself to bringing up larger concepts and then never really exploring them. This is a film content to revel in quasi-philosophical wonderings without any real sort of point of view and, once again, we plumb the depths of the basic gist of Chariots of the Gods? without adding anything even remotely new to the concept (which is even sadder when you realize that they've even already explored this concept in the colossally dumb first AvP movie.) This is a movie trying very hard to be serious, but ending up as hokey as any other sci-fi film that takes itself way too seriously. As a result, this is a film that has style to spare, but barely any substance to speak of.On this, I would point the finger at Lindelof. He did the same thing with the TV series Lost (bringing up questions without any answers and then casually trying to cop out by claiming the questions are bigger than the answers) and this is a 2-hour film version of that screenwriting conundrum with a lot of visual flair and an unsatisfying reason to exist. I didn't find the characters to be especially fleshed-out and I found the main plot points to be a little ham-handed. Some elements of the script feel like they were written by first-year philosophy students and other elements are simply winking at the Alien franchise. Ultimately, there's only one thing I found interesting in this movie and it's something that isn't even addressed in this film, but seems to be held over for a sequel (SPOILER ALERT - I thought it would be interesting to follow Noomi Rapace's character to the Engineer homeworld, but it looks like that won't happen until a sequel.) To me, it seems like this movie wants to be so much more than it is and it's frustrating to watch it struggle at the seams.Of course, many reviewers have already pointed out the nonsensical antics of most of the characters: Yes, several characters in this movie do not make sense - whether doing things that do not make sense, existing for no apparent reason or vaguely being an archetype for a whole host of sci-fi cliches (never trust a robot... unless it's R2-D2... because he'll save your ass every time you do something idiotic.) A large number of these characters' motivations seem unbelievable, a few characters are incredibly unlikable, but most are played by actors and actresses you like in other things. I like Michael Fassbender, I like Charlize Theron, I like Idris Elba and I even like Noomi Rapace, but most of these talents are seriously wasted. Seriously, Idris Elba is more interesting in Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance and have you seen that film? That film's a wreck, but at least he's entertaining in it. Here... well, he's in it, but that's about all I can say. Same thing for Charlize Theron - you keep waiting for her character to pay off eventually, but it never does, so it begs the question: why is the character there? Some of the other characters are pointless, too, but you know that they're alien fodder, so they don't really matter. It's a shame that most of the main cast don't really matter either.Like people who are fans of this film, I was fascinated by the Engineers themselves and wanted to know more about them, but the film isn't interested in exploring them for any length of time and, from what information we do get of them, they're mostly a parallel to humans themselves in other entries of this series (in that they fool around with things they couldn't possibly hope to understand and usually destroy themselves doing it.) Maybe this is the central conceit of the film: we're the Engineers, the Engineers are us... man, that's boring. It's one of the oldest chestnuts in the bag of sci-fi cliche - make up an alien race that's pretty much a mirror image of us and point out the irony in the dumb things that we do. I get it. It's been done. It's been done a lot. It gets old after awhile, but not as old as these other cliche chestnuts that Prometheus explores: 1.) Humans are so dumb, they couldn't have possibly evolved without the help of alien interference; 2.) Although they helped to create us, we will never really be on the same level as our alien benefactors, so whenever we try to reach towards the heavens, they will destroy us...; 3.) ...which is kind of a religious allegory that calls into question the very nature of faith itself. Are we all part of some sort of divine plan (alien or otherwise) or are we just fooling ourselves into thinking that we're more than the sum of our parts? These are heavy concepts, to be sure, but like I've said previously, they're concepts the film delights in bringing up, but never fully exploring (in fact, it reminds me slightly of Star Trek V, which tried to explore similar territory, but then suddenly remembered it was a Star Trek movie halfway through and threw in a bunch of Klingons and an alien pretending to be God to skirt around the issue.)The bottom line is this: the Alien films seem to work best when they're either a straight-up horror-type film like the original Alien or a balls-to-the-wall action film like Aliens. Whenever it strays too far from either of these genres, it seems to fall flat and be mediocre at best. Prometheus might work better if it were removed from the Alien franchise and stood alone as its own work (which is something the film seems like it wants to do, but knows it'll gain an audience if you relate it to something audiences already liked, which really just results in a film without a coherent identity.) At the end of the day, it's more enjoyable than some of the entries into the franchise, but it won't be one that you'll necessarily return to as often (for me, I'm always down for watching Alien and Aliens, I'll reluctantly watch Alien 3 and pass over Alien: Resurrection without comment. AvP is its own thing and I don't know that I can ever fully integrate it into the Alien franchise as a whole.) Prometheus is a movie that I might get talked into watching again solely because the visuals are so stunning, so even though I don't care much for what is happening on screen, it sure looks beautiful. As for the casual viewer, I can only recommend it if you go in with the right amount of expectations. If you aren't expecting much, you will find it watchable. If you're expecting a lot, forget it, because you won't find it here.It's interesting to note that in Greek mythology, Prometheus played a trick on Zeus, offering up two different sacrifices: one was a selection of beef hidden inside an ox's stomach (nourishment hidden inside a displeasing exterior), and the bull's bones wrapped completely in ""glistening fat"" (something inedible hidden inside a pleasing exterior). Zeus chose the latter and, like this movie, that's what we, as audiences, got: something inedible hidden inside a pleasing exterior...",3,"Visually Stunning, But Sorely Lacking...",1353196800,"11 18,

I can see some truth in those observations, but there's still enough good stuff in Prometheus that I got a kick out of it.  First, the opening scene is fairly amazing, although I'll admit I still didn't quite understand it, even after watching the entire flick.  Then there's all the sci-fi/tech/CGI elements, which include but aren't limited to how great the ship looks landing on the alien planet, the nifty ""puppies"" (flying probes sent out to map the inside of the ancient Engineers' structure), and the automated surgical capsule.  Also, as a fan of the Alien film series (not counting the AvP movies, which are another thing), I appreciated all of the links to the other films, especially the android David and the giant control chair the Engineer sits in.  Whatever Ridley Scott says, Prometheus is certainly an Alien prequel -- the final scene leaves no doubt about that.  In fact, I'd rate it maybe 3rd or 4th best out of the five Alien films.  One negative aspect, though, was the poor or limited use of 3D.  I experimented with briefly removing my 3D glasses every so often for comparison, and usually I could see no difference between 2D and 3D.

There is real excitement.Later, LG sold me 3D TVs and Blu-Ray 3D players that were not ready for the marketplace. LG stinks. It took them over a year to issue a firmware fix/patch for 3 out of 6 products I bought from Amazon.The 3D is very excellent.The lack of 3D takes away from the movie. If these damn studios claim it is 3D then they are liars. There is no in your face 3D in this movie even at the most critical 3D times in the script. And 3D has been around for a century. It was around at the San Francisco World's Fair in 1915.The San Francisco World's Fair's 3D is stunning. Check it out on the WWW.Editing, 3D was around in 1830s in stereoscopic viewers, something like Viewmaster. Euclid himself knew about stereo vision. How ancient is that?I remember the 3 Stooges 3D movie or movies when I was a little kid. The 3D was vastly superior in the day of the 3 Stooges. WYSIWYG. If the cardboard glasses deliver great 3D and Blu-Ray 3D ain't great, which is better?The actors in all these movies are carrying on to keep themselves out of print in the movies themselves. Prometheus is no exception. Perhaps, these morons think they are making a threat with their words,scenes and stupid gestures. I guess they call it a one two career saving punch. Show business would start a war for their next role, their next production. How American can that be?Give me 3D or shove it. Have to pay a premium for 3D that doesn't really exist. The openings have graphically 3D titles. Then the 3D is reduced to about nothing. My LG 3D TV set works. My LG 3D DVD Blu-Ray player has the latest patch. My glasses are the recommended. Got em all at Amazon.There should be laws protecting the consumer over 3D fraud.Show business stinks and are partly responsible for the WorldTradeCenter. 9/11? 9/11 is 911 the police emergency telephone number. Show business and the press have never said a word about that or anything about their entertainment or the telephone companies comments. The government is pathetic and sickening.Would buy Prometheus as a regular DVD release if I were you. Where is the beef? Where is the 3D.Want 3D where I to have duck, bob, dodge and weave objects coming at me. I want the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune in my face. Want to use my arms and hands to defend myself against the 3D onslaught on the screen. Traditional movies have the same vanishing point and perspective basically as most 3D movies. In the critical 3D scenes in Prometheus there was no 3D. The opening with Noomi mulling and puking into a bowl there was no vomit spill over unto the viewer. There was no sand/silica storm blowing in your face. Noomi's operation in the medical pod had no 3D where it was most crucial. The worms/snakes attacking the crew in the alien craft had no 3D whatsoever where it was very important. And on and on...My comments are honest. I am not trying to sound like a snob with excessively florid language. Am not in the employ of the studios. Want Prometheus? Buy the regular DVD and save the difference. Damn good movie. It is a terrific movie.Avatar is coming out next week. Have seen a few clips from a B&W; version that had tremendously excellent 3D. Will the new release deliver the same?

One can only assume the producers figured fans of the frist two ""Alien"" films would line up for a prequel that answered the questions those films raised. Had I been the reader, I would have sent back the script with ""Try again -- a lot harder!"" scribbled on the cover.I expected a film with profound insights into Life, the Universe, and Everything. What I got was a story that, for the first 90 minutes, rehashed ""Alien"". The voyagers do all the stupid things the people in the first film do, with minor variations. When we finally start getting answers to our questions, they turn out not to be particularly surprising or deep. And at least one major issue isn't properly addressed or resolved.The following is from the Wikipedia article: ""According to Scott, although the film shares 'strands of Alien's DNA, so to speak', and takes place in the same universe, Prometheus explores its own mythology and ideas."" Most viewers are likely to strongly disagree -- especially as the first film had no particular mythology, or any ""idea"" other than to scare the crap out of the audience (which it did very well).The script is mechanical, sloppy, and thin, especially in the dialog department. Unlike the first two films, which focus tightly on the characters and their predicament, ""Prometheus"" has unnecessary scenes and slack, pointless dialog. I was particularly annoyed by the scenes in which Janek asks Vickers if she's interested in hanky-panky, and Vickers stating that Weyland is her father (when their //actions// up to that point make that clear).Ridley Scott's direction is no more than competent. Though the general lack of tension might be partly due to our familiarity with the material, it's hard to believe ""Prometheus"" was directed by the man who helmed ""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner"". The only sequence that doesn't come across as wholly mechanical is Shaw's using a computer-controlled surgery machine to perform a Caesarian. But it's so over the top that it's hard to believe, as is Shaw's ability to be up and around right after.A major disappointment from a director who seems to have been asleep at the wheel.",1,"diddly-squat -- a big, fat, nothing",1357776000,"01 10, 2013",2013,2196,"['difficult', 'understand', 'how', 'such', 'ill-conceived', 'film', 'got', 'funded', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'producers', 'figured', 'fans', 'frist', 'two', 'Alien', 'films', 'would', 'line', 'up', 'prequel', 'answered', 'questions', 'films', 'raised', 'Had', 'been', 'reader', 'would', 'have', 'sent', 'back', 'script', 'Try', 'again', 'lot', 'harder', 'scribbled', 'cover.I', 'expected', 'film', 'profound', 'insights', 'Life', 'Universe', 'Everything', 'What', 'got', 'was', 'story', 'first', '90', 'minutes', 'rehashed', 'Alien', 'voyagers', 'do', 'stupid', 'things', 'people', 'first', 'film', 'do', 'minor', 'variations', 'When', 'finally', 'start', 'getting', 'answers', 'questions', 'turn', 'out', 'not', 'be', 'particularly', 'surprising', 'deep', 'least', 'one', 'major', 'issue', ""n't"", 'properly', 'addressed', 'resolved.The', 'following', 'Wikipedia', 'article', 'According', 'Scott', 'film', 'shares', 'Alien', 'DNA', 'so', 'speak', 'place', 'same', 'universe', 'Prometheus', 'own', 'mythology', 'ideas', 'Most', 'viewers', 'are', 'likely', 'strongly', 'disagree', 'especially', 'first', 'film', 'had', 'particular', 'mythology', 'idea', 'other', 'scare', 'crap', 'audience', 'did', 'very', 'well', '.The', 'script', 'mechanical', 'sloppy', 'thin', 'especially', 'dialog', 'department', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'focus', 'tightly', 'characters', 'predicament', 'Prometheus', 'unnecessary', 'scenes', 'slack', 'pointless', 'dialog', 'was', 'particularly', 'annoyed', 'scenes', 'Janek', 'Vickers', 'interested', 'hanky-panky', 'Vickers', 'stating', 'Weyland', 'father', 'when', '//actions//', 'up', 'point', 'make', 'clear', '.Ridley', 'Scott', 'direction', 'more', 'competent', 'general', 'lack', 'tension', 'might', 'be', 'partly', 'due', 'familiarity', 'material', 'hard', 'believe', 'Prometheus', 'was', 'directed', 'man', 'who', 'helmed', 'Alien', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'only', 'sequence', ""n't"", 'come', 'wholly', 'mechanical', 'Shaw', 'using', 'computer-controlled', 'surgery', 'machine', 'perform', 'Caesarian', 'so', 'top', 'hard', 'believe', 'Shaw', 'ability', 'be', 'up', 'around', 'right', 'after.A', 'major', 'disappointment', 'director', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'asleep', 'wheel']",N/A

Charlize Theron, in particular, put on an exceptional performance. Her character, with never a gelled blond hair out of place, came across as steelier and more robotic than the robot character. On anyone else with a gorgeous figure like hers, the cat-suit would have enhanced the feminine side - on her, it just smoothed over those human little bumps and folds, giving an inhuman impression of plastic perfection.What's not: Pretty much everything else. The space-suit helmets reminded me ofOutland- the lights pointed inward, conveniently illuminating the characters' faces, but blinding them in the process. Utter lack of quarantine against alien biota worked well for the plot but badly for common sense. The android's bio-sabotage of a fellow crewman came across without feeling - not even malice or greed, just one more chore to get done. And, although enjoyable in itself, Noomi Rapace's underwear scene just couldn't compare to Sigourney Weaver's back in the original Alien.If you haven't seen the originalAlienmovies, and Weaver's ""Ripley"" character in particular, this comes across as a perfectly adequate SF/monster flick, maybe a cut above in its production values. Alien is iconic, though.

The effects and visuals alone justify the ticket purchase, or in this case, the Amazon rental. However, the plot, writing and repeated gaps were painful. Indeed, they were so disparately jarring at times that the ability to suspend reality and enjoy the ride was impacted. I found myself constantly seeing the flaws as I watched the movie. It was worse than the horror flick where the main characters say ""let's split up and search"" - although in that genre you often forgive that particular cliche. In good science fiction, one needs internal consistency and solid writing - and even with a willing fan who will overlook many negatives - Prometheus fell far short of the bare minimum. I would still see it for the frame of reference, but don't expect a lot.Spoiler Alert - stop here if that's a concern for you. These are small examples apart from the overall story issues:If you have absurd technology that can 3-d map a hive-like stone structure on the surface of an alien planet in real time, how do characters get lost finding their way back outside? If those same charactes are a biologist and a geologist, would they really just leave the main group (for lack of interest) when the others have discovered alien technology/artifacts/bodies? If that same technology can detect life forms and give you active feeds on people's video/life signs, how do you not know what happened to them? If you are wearing clear helmets as part of an enclosed space suit, wouldn't there be a system to prevent them from fogging up? If you encounter a new life form that looks a lot like an aggravated cobra sizing you up for a meal... do you pet it like a puppy dog? Do you enter that same area without a single weapon or any security personnnel, especially when the lead corporate characters like to avoid risk? Do you use a ship that has not one offensive capability when traveling a bazillion miles from Earth so that ramming speed is your only option? If there is widespread contagion in a crew member (quizzotically put there by a corporate-created artificial human that we have no rules for, nor apparently do the characters expect any either) and that infected crew member has sex with another crew member - wouldn't the contagion spread throughout the second? If you are cut open to the core to remove a foreign object and stapled shut... should you be running a marathon the same day for example - even allowing for drugs, which the viewer has to assume will dull tremendous pain but have no effect on your mental state or physical performance? When said foreign object is removed and advanced medical tech machines are instructed to kill it... how many ways could that have been done so that the object actually dies without coming back?The list goes on and on... and while I can take unknowns in my Sci-Fi movies, and I often relish hard to understand plots that leave the viewer thinking... that's not what happened here.",2,Good Effects Only Go So Far,1349827200,"10 10, 2012",2012,3011,"['Sci-Fi', 'fan', 'forever', 'can', 'say', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'completely', 'dissapointed', 'film', 'effects', 'visuals', 'alone', 'justify', 'ticket', 'purchase', 'case', 'Amazon', 'rental', 'However', 'plot', 'writing', 'repeated', 'gaps', 'were', 'painful', 'Indeed', 'were', 'so', 'disparately', 'jarring', 'times', 'ability', 'suspend', 'reality', 'enjoy', 'ride', 'was', 'impacted', 'found', 'constantly', 'seeing', 'flaws', 'watched', 'movie', 'was', 'worse', 'horror', 'flick', 'where', 'main', 'characters', 'say', 'let', 'split', 'up', 'search', 'genre', 'often', 'forgive', 'particular', 'cliche', 'good', 'science', 'fiction', 'one', 'internal', 'consistency', 'solid', 'writing', 'even', 'willing', 'fan', 'who', 'will', 'overlook', 'many', 'negatives', 'Prometheus', 'fell', 'far', 'short', 'bare', 'minimum', 'would', 'still', 'see', 'frame', 'reference', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'lot.Spoiler', 'Alert', 'stop', 'here', 'concern', 'are', 'small', 'examples', 'apart', 'overall', 'story', 'issues', 'have', 'absurd', 'technology', 'can', '3-d', 'map', 'hive-like', 'stone', 'structure', 'surface', 'alien', 'planet', 'real', 'time', 'how', 'do', 'characters', 'get', 'lost', 'finding', 'way', 'back', 'same', 'charactes', 'are', 'biologist', 'geologist', 'would', 'really', 'just', 'leave', 'main', 'group', 'lack', 'interest', 'when', 'others', 'have', 'discovered', 'alien', 'technology/artifacts/bodies', 'same', 'technology', 'can', 'detect', 'life', 'forms', 'give', 'active', 'feeds', 'people', 'video/life', 'signs', 'how', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'are', 'wearing', 'clear', 'helmets', 'part', 'enclosed', 'space', 'suit', 'would', ""n't"", 'there', 'be', 'system', 'prevent', 'fogging', 'up', 'encounter', 'new', 'life', 'form', 'lot', 'aggravated', 'cobra', 'sizing', 'up', 'meal', 'do', 'pet', 'puppy', 'dog', 'Do', 'enter', 'same', 'area', 'single', 'weapon', 'security', 'personnnel', 'especially', 'when', 'lead', 'corporate', 'characters', 'avoid', 'risk', 'Do', 'use', 'ship', 'not', 'one', 'offensive', 'capability', 'when', 'traveling', 'bazillion', 'miles', 'Earth', 'ramming', 'speed', 'only', 'option', 'widespread', 'contagion', 'crew', 'member', 'quizzotically', 'put', 'there', 'corporate-created', 'artificial', 'human', 'have', 'rules', 'apparently', 'do', 'characters', 'expect', 'infected', 'crew', 'member', 'sex', 'crew', 'member', 'would', ""n't"", 'contagion', 'spread', 'second', 'are', 'cut', 'open', 'core', 'remove', 'foreign', 'object', 'stapled', 'shut', 'should', 'be', 'running', 'marathon', 'same', 'day', 'example', 'even', 'allowing', 'drugs', 'viewer', 'assume', 'will', 'dull', 'tremendous', 'pain', 'have', 'effect', 'mental', 'state', 'physical', 'performance', 'When', 'said', 'foreign', 'object', 'removed', 'advanced', 'medical', 'tech', 'machines', 'are', 'instructed', 'kill', 'how', 'many', 'ways', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'so', 'object', 'actually', 'coming', 'back', 'list', 'can', 'take', 'unknowns', 'Sci-Fi', 'movies', 'often', 'relish', 'hard', 'understand', 'plots', 'leave', 'viewer', 'thinking', 'not', 'what', 'happened', 'here']",N/A

As for the 6 alternate scenes, all 15 minutes were fun to watch. I think the only scene completely dropped was the one where those two guys that got lost on the alien ship, find the snake-like shedded skin. The alternate scenes were either slightly longer versions of the original scenes (like the Christmas tree), or completely rewritten scenes (like the sex scene, when Noomi gets pregnant with an alien.) The 5.1 mix was well done, however the mixers played bizarre games with the dynamics. Since Prometheus is a ""rock movie"", you have to play it LOUD. I have 15"" Woofers, and they couldnt reproduce the Prometheus' lift-off sound without distorted rumbling. If you dont play this soundtrack thru a fairly good Home Theater sound system, I'm afraid you'll get a lot of distortion during the loud portions of the film. (The storm, the liftoff, orchestral swells, etc.)As for the film itself, visually its simply stunning. The overlay of intricate CGI provides the alien ship an oppulent, fairy tale quality. However, the Prometheus ship is all clean lines and white walls. Quite the opposit from the first Alien movie's earth ship, with its dark, threatening, industrial design. The Alien space ship in PROMETHEUS, is hands down the creepiest, most realistic depliction of an Alien craft ever created on film. In that sense, Ridley Scott surpased his masterpeice, ALIEN. But the visuals at times are so intricate and overlayered they confuse the eye. And the plot does the same--confuse and overwhelm. Just how many DIFFERENT aliens exist in this film? How many forms does each alien morph thru? How many cast members got infected this time? Four? Add to that the infected Alien, plus the dead aliens that were infected 2000 years ago. You need a flow chart to figure out whats going on.Apparently the complex plot sets up the next two films. That's good to know. Maybe we'll find out why that Alien drinks acid and melts at the beginning of the movie. When all's said and done, PROMETHEUS is a complex, visually stunning cinematic achievement. I cant place it at the same level of ALIEN, but only ""2001"" and ""StarWars"" sit that high. My only regret is that I bought the cheapest version.

The film is an incoherent, hyperactive, jabbering, noisy mess mainly based on the image of the fossilized pilot of the derelict starship from the original 1979 ""Alien"". The killer aliens are merely incidental in this new film and aren't anything scarier or more original than anything you've seen before. That there is hardly a single character one identifies with or even likes isn't why this movie sucks, nor is it the non-stop background music that only serves to muddy the soundtrack or the horrible dialogue that drops not-so-subtley contrived hints as to later events. It isn't even the lack of atmosphere one normally associates with Scott's films.What it is that makes this film so awful is exactly what ruined ""Lost"": too many unsolved mysteries designed to get you to come back and see more, and too many cases of lead characters spouting dialogue claiming that things are one way or another and being wrong every time just to suit the plot - what Lindelof attributed to ""faith"" in both ""Prometheus"" and ""Lost"". The fact is that Damon is not a talented enough writer to answer or solve any of the interesting stuff he randomly hurls against the walls of his audience's attention. And this film is a cliff-hanger and no one, not even the critics, have bothered to tell the public. You are not going to understand what the hell is going on at any given moment of this film and you will not be provided with answers. The list of unsolved or explained baloney is too long to get into so I'll leave it to the geeks to squabble over. I saw the original ""Alien"" in the theatres - I have nothing to prove.As with ""Lost"" after six seasons, do not be disappointed if in, say, 10 years from now the last chapter of the ""Alien"" prequel saga leaves you more baffled than when you began in 2012 and you are told by the producers, Lindelof among them, that it was all ""character oriented"" - you aren't supposed to care about the whats and whys, just Noomi and if she's happy in the end.As for me, I won't be among you. I will be re-watching the first (and only, as far as I'm concerned) ""Alien"" film and enjoying every terrifying minute. You say I can't erase three decades of ""Alien"" history, that it's canon? Phooey - Lindelof changes the rules and reasons all the time in the course of two hours, reducing his plots to the point of nonsense - and I'm asking 20th Century Fox for my money back.Screw you, Damon.***********************************************************************************DAMON LINDELOF, RE-IMAGINED:The fantasy-loving American public has been wild about deconstructions and ""re-imaginings"" since Alan Moore re-wrote the origin of the DC comic's ""Swamp Thing"" in 1985. In the interest of complete fairness, consider this:Those of us who lived through the life and times of Andy Kaufman will recall how, from ground level and at any particular moment, he appeared unfunny and perhaps insane. I mean, my family groaned when he came on Saturday Night Live - he really sucked. And yet, with hindsight, the body of work he left behind after an untimely death proves him to be a rare genius - even funny. It just took a while to get there, an overview of everything he performed... and a cold corpse.Lindelof may in fact be such a genius. Throughout ""Lost"" the primary point was faith versus science, or factual knowledge - which is better? How do ordinary people cope and where do they differ, what are their individual approaches to life's catastrophes? Great questions, great theme, even if Lindelhof reduces ""faith"" to simply one's personal assertions having little to do with spirituality or ""super-rational intuition"" as Aldous Huxley would phrase it - knowledge of the heart. And Lindelhof carries this theme into ""Prometheus"", wherein his primary cast are motivated by ""faith"": a trillionaire spends all his money seeking an audience with an alien master race to obtain immortality. Who said they were immortal or had the secret? No one in the course of the film does, yet he has ""faith"". Likewise in ""Prometheus"", ancient neolithic cave maps show the location of alien beings among the stars. Noomi Rapace goes to meet her ""makers"". Who said they created human life? No one. She just has ""faith"", and later by the film's conclusion she is ""... so wrong!!!"".Throughout ""Lost"", the ""faith-based"" character, Locke, finds himself continually wrong about his deeply held beliefs regarding the bizarre island he and other plane crash survivors are stranded on. That he is wrong repeatedly does not serve to encourage him to take anyone else's word for anything during the course of the show's six seasons and eventually he ends up dead and his corpse possessed by a devil of some sort.A writer relates the plot to his audience through his character's dialogue. Revelations during the course of a plot must be consistent and correct. If the characters are consistently wrong in their assertions, the viewer ceases to suspend disbelief (necessary in a fantasy film) and simply disbelieves. The plot becomes nonsense and the story crashes. The audience walks out - disinterested, unfulfilled, angry.So, is Damon, throughout the body of his professional work, trying to show us something about the futility - nay, the stupidity - of blind faith and subjective assertions? Is he criticizing the concept of faith throughout his work by making us despise his ""faith based"" protagonists for jerking us around repeatedly? Could it be that by constantly irritating his audience with these ""plot fails"" (Hollywood calls them ""twists"") that he is trying over time to prove a point about the importance of being sure of one's facts? That would indeed be a gift. Much of the world bases it's important decisions on ""faith"" and personal feelings than on facts or evidence - it could indeed use such a lesson, however long-term it may take during the course of Lindelof's career.So maybe Damon's body of work won't be recognized for it's brilliance until his demise... or maybe he just isn't that talented.Genius or idiot? If he dropped dead now we could find out.",1,"""A film is made, and then it sucks..."" or ""Screw you, Damon!""",1340668800,"06 26, 2012",2012,6389,"['knew', 'better', 'said', 'so', 'review', 'Lost',

The alien DNA breaking and then going through recombination with some kind of small earth amoeba living in the ocean is typical of someone who made a movie without any advice or consultation from a biologist. Or if Ridley Scott had a biologist on the set, the guy is purely and totally incompetent.Few words on the plot: Scientists discover in a cave in 2089 drawings from 5000 years ago attesting to the fact that aliens came to colonize the planet. Fast forward 2093 when an eccentric billionaire has paid for a mission to go to a planet where we think the Alien creatures came. Michael Fassbender plays David a robot who apparently knows a lot about the mission, however nobody on the ship appears to realize it. We also find out that he knows how to drive the alien ship and he knows how to speak their language. Maybe in the next two movies we will find what is exactly his role. The other important player in the movie is Noomi Rapace (Elisabeth) who is one of the doctors of the mission. There are 15 more people on the mission and outside the driver of the ship and Charlize Theron, a really cold and calculated person, we don't know exactly what everybody is doing on the ship and why they are there.I strongly believe that David is homage to ""2001 Space Odyssey"" (...I am sorry Dave I think I cannot do that). His voice, and his demeanor reminds us of the robot driving the ship in ""2001 Space Odyssey"". Also the plots are similar. I also believe that Elisabeth reminds us of Lizbeth, the"" Girl with the Dragon tattoo"". I am not sure why Scott kept the names, but throughout the entire movie, and since I was not sitting on the edge of my seat, I was constanly reminded of ""2001 Space Odysee"" and of the ""Girl with the dragon tattoo"".Charlize Theron's role is totally secondary, and while her acting is absolutely fantastic as always, I think she should be more involved.Three stars for the fantastic performance of the actors, and for the special effects, but the movie plot is really a work in progress.
