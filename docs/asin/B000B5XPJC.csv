I've done both DVDs & prefer her newer DVDs.  I dont think they are as hard or as intense as her other DVDs, I wasnt sore the next day after either workout & w/her other DVDs I'm always sore the next day.  They are both fast paced & relatively short workouts but they do make you sweat & are good when you are short on time.",3,"Fairly ""easy"" for a Jillian workout",1267488000,"03 2, 2010",2010,498,"['saw', 'DVD', 'two', 'pack', 'w/the', 'maximize', 'full', 'frontal', 'local', 'discount', 'store', 'enjoy', 'Jillian', 'other', 'DVDs', '30DS', 'NMTZ', 'BFBM', 'thought', ""'d"", 'give', 'try', ""'ve"", 'done', 'DVDs', 'prefer', 'newer', 'DVDs', 'dont', 'think', 'are', 'as', 'hard', 'as', 'intense', 'other', 'DVDs', 'wasnt', 'sore', 'next', 'day', 'workout', 'w/her', 'other', 'DVDs', ""'m"", 'always', 'sore', 'next', 'day', 'are', 'fast', 'paced', 'relatively', 'short', 'workouts', 'do', 'make', 'sweat', 'are', 'good', 'when', 'are', 'short', 'time']","The Biggest Winner: How to Win by Losing (Butt, Back, Abs, Hamstrings, Biceps, Nutrition)"
936349,ARACFER5IVXIP,B000B5XPJC,Marylou Hansen,"[0, 0]",What can I say... it is Jillian.  I love her toughness!!  I own all of her work-out DVDs (except beginners) and use them on a daily basis.  I am pretty buff for a woman in her mid 60s and I give Jillian some of the credit.  ALL of her work-outs are intense and give you the MOST bang for the buck (or time).  Her 30day Shred is KILLER!!!  I am in really good shape (ask my personal trainer) and this work-out leaves me completely exhausted..GO Jillian!!!,5,ahhhh Jillian,1233100800,"01 28, 2009",2009,454,"['What', 'can', 'say', 'Jillian', 'love', 'toughness', 'own', 'work-out', 'DVDs', 'beginners', 'use', 'daily', 'basis', 'am', 'pretty', 'buff', 'woman', 'mid', '60s', 'give', 'Jillian', 'credit', 'work-outs', 'are', 'intense', 'give', 'MOST', 'bang', 'buck', 'time', '30day', 'Shred', 'KILLER', 'am', 'really', 'good', 'shape', 'ask', 'personal', 'trainer', 'work-out', 'completely', 'exhausted..GO', 'Jillian']","The Biggest Winner: How to Win by Losing (Butt, Back, Abs, Hamstrings, Biceps, Nutrition)"

As one reviewer pointed out, many will need to warm up just to be able to do the warm ups - all of the exercises are performed very, very fast compared to what I've seen in other videos, and they aren't that easy if you aren't already in good shape.  That said, there is one person in there who performs the easier version of many of the exercises but the problem is that often the camera doesn't even show her so you don't know how to do the less intense version.  Instead, it seems to focus mainly on keeping up the pace and pushing yourself to the limit (or even beyond).  This looks like a good workout, but beginners will have to ease into it. Like I said, I haven't done the exercises yet but I already know it is going to be a struggle!",4,"Seems Intense, Not for Beginners",1164412800,"11 25, 2006",2006,969,"['must', 'confess', 'have', 'not', 'actually', 'tried', 'exercises', 'dvd', 'did', 'watch', 'can', 'tell', 'based', 'own', 'experience', 'watching', 'following', 'along', 'other', 'exercise', 'dvd', 'one', 'not', 'beginners', 'one', 'reviewer', 'pointed', 'out', 'many', 'will', 'need', 'warm', 'up', 'just', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'warm', 'ups', 'exercises', 'are', 'performed', 'very', 'very', 'fast', 'compared', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'videos', 'are', ""n't"", 'easy', 'are', ""n't"", 'already', 'good', 'shape', 'said', 'one', 'person', 'who', 'easier', 'version', 'many', 'exercises', 'problem', 'often', 'camera', ""n't"", 'even', 'show', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'do', 'less', 'intense', 'version', 'Instead', 'focus', 'mainly', 'keeping', 'up', 'pace', 'pushing', 'limit', 'even', 'good', 'workout', 'beginners', 'will', 'have', 'ease', 'said', 'have', ""n't"", 'done', 'exercises', 'yet', 'already', 'know', 'going', 'be', 'struggle']","The Biggest Winner: How to Win by Losing (Butt, Back, Abs, Hamstrings, Biceps, Nutrition)"
