She's determined5. They're divorced6. They're going treasure hunting7. You can guess the ending before watching the opening creditsIn other words, there's nothing new about this light and ditzy treasure hunting romp that plays heavily on stereotyping and McConaughey's shirtless bod.The legend behind the treasure is interesting enough. Forty chests of gold and jewels, destined to be a dowry fit for an eighteenth century queen, was lost without a trace during the hurricane season of 1715.  Finn (McConaughey) and Tess (Hudson) had been searching for it for years, until an accidental discovery clues them in that they're finally on the right track.With the exception of Donald Sutherland, the movie loses momentum whenever the supporting actors are on-screen and the burden of the caricaturized characters sink the movie even deeper than the plotline.The action scenes were good, especially at the end, and although there is violence, most of it is off camera.

1137698,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0012KJ0DK,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 3]","The horrible reviews made me well aware walking into this that it was going to be pretty bad.  Still, I had hope.  While I am not an avid fan of McConaughey or Hudson for that matter, I really enjoyed both on them in `How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days' and was excited about them reteaming for this film.  When you couple that with the fact that Dennis Sutherland is a wonderful veteran actor, Ray Winstone is one of my favorite guilty pleasures and the whole premise reminded me of `Into the Blue', a film that I am not ashamed to admit totally loving (yes, I do occasionally shut my brain off and enjoy ridiculousness) you can see why I wanted to see this despite the poor reception given by critics.I mean, this is obviously not a critic's darling.Sadly, this movie fails on so many levels I can't even begin to understand why anyone would give this more than one solitary star (if it even deserves that, but you cannot review it without giving it a star placement).  I mean, the film is ridiculously stupid (especially that whole blowhole thing) and horribly acted and there is absolutely no real chemistry between the two leads (I'm serious, everything appears forced).I can't find a redeeming factor anywhere.The film tells the story of recently divorced Finn and Tess.  Finn is a slacker who owes a ton of money to a rapper and Tess is working for a millionaire and is easily distracted by her ex-husbands apparent charm.  First of all I want to point out that neither of these two stars has ever looked WORSE on screen than they do here.  McConaughey (who is rather unattractive when you take away his stomach anyway) looks like a washed up shipwreck survivor here, with some of the worst hair I've ever seen, and Hudson, who was once so stunning, is aging horribly and looks just hard, worn and overly tanned here.  The acting between them, especially on the part of Matthew, is just C-Grade movie mediocre.  They can't stumble through their lengthy treasure ogling speeches without sounding like they are reading off of a plaque board.There is no naturalism here, at all.So Finn finds remnants of this legendary treasure he and Tess have waited nearly forever to find and so he persuades her, and her boss, to embark on a treasure hunt.  They have competition in Finn's former employee, Moe, as well as rapper Biggbunny (he said it was one word).When you strip chemistry and acting from a film this preposterous you are left with absolutely nothing to warrant its existence.Alexis Dziena is just excruciating here, Ray Winstone's accent goes in and out in every scene (I still love you, but I have to be honest), Kevin Hart is just another stereotype and WHAT WAS UP WITH MALCOLM-JAMAL WARNER?!?!?!?I don't think I can express enough hatred for this vile cinematic offering.  I wish that I had never seen it.  Wait, I wish that it had never been made so that I would never have been tricked into thinking that I could possible enjoy it.  It is that worthless.  I hate films that are worthless.  I mean, even bad films have SOMETHING to justify their existence.  These people don't even look pretty here.This should have starred the sexy beast (you know who you are).",1,Fun in the sun...right?,1257724800,"11 9, 2009",2009,3171,"['horrible', 'reviews', 'made', 'well', 'aware', 'walking', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'pretty', 'bad', 'Still', 'had', 'hope', 'am', 'not', 'avid', 'fan', 'McConaughey', 'Hudson', 'matter', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'How', 'Lose', 'Guy', '10', 'Days', 'was', 'excited', 'reteaming', 'film', 'When', 'couple', 'fact', 'Dennis', 'Sutherland', 'wonderful', 'veteran', 'actor', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'one', 'favorite', 'guilty', 'pleasures', 'whole', 'premise', 'reminded', 'Blue', 'film', 'am', 'not', 'ashamed', 'admit', 'totally', 'loving', 'yes', 'do', 'occasionally', 'shut', 'brain', 'enjoy', 'ridiculousness', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'wanted', 'see', 'poor', 'reception', 'given', 'critics.I', 'mean', 'obviously', 'not', 'critic', 'darling.Sadly', 'movie', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'begin', 'understand', 'why', 'anyone', 'would', 'give', 'more', 'one', 'solitary', 'star', 'even', 'can', 'not', 'review', 'giving', 'star', 'placement', 'mean', 'film', 'ridiculously', 'stupid', 'especially', 'whole', 'blowhole', 'thing', 'horribly', 'acted', 'absolutely', 'real', 'chemistry', 'two', 'leads', ""'m"", 'serious', 'everything', 'forced', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'redeeming', 'factor', 'anywhere.The', 'film', 'story', 'recently', 'divorced', 'Finn', 'Tess', 'Finn', 'slacker', 'who', 'ton', 'money', 'rapper', 'Tess', 'working', 'millionaire', 'easily', 'distracted', 'ex-husbands', 'apparent', 'charm', 'First', 'want', 'point', 'out', 'two', 'stars', 'ever', 'looked', 'WORSE', 'screen', 'do', 'here', 'McConaughey', 'who', 'rather', 'unattractive', 'when', 'take', 'away', 'stomach', 'anyway', 'washed', 'up', 'shipwreck', 'survivor', 'here', 'worst', 'hair', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Hudson', 'who', 'was', 'once', 'so', 'stunning', 'aging', 'horribly', 'just', 'hard', 'worn', 'overly', 'tanned', 'here', 'acting', 'especially', 'part', 'Matthew', 'just', 'C-Grade', 'movie', 'mediocre', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stumble', 'lengthy', 'treasure', 'ogling', 'speeches', 'sounding', 'are', 'reading', 'plaque', 'naturalism', 'here', 'all.So', 'Finn', 'remnants', 'legendary', 'treasure', 'Tess', 'have', 'waited', 'nearly', 'forever', 'find', 'so', 'boss', 'embark', 'treasure', 'hunt', 'have', 'competition', 'Finn', 'former', 'employee', 'Moe', 'as', 'well', 'rapper', 'Biggbunny', 'said', 'was', 'one', 'word', '.When', 'strip', 'chemistry', 'acting', 'film', 'preposterous', 'are', 'left', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'warrant', 'existence.Alexis', 'Dziena', 'just', 'excruciating', 'here', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'accent', 'scene', 'still', 'love', 'have', 'be', 'honest', 'Kevin', 'Hart', 'just', 'stereotype', 'WHAT', 'WAS', 'UP', 'WITH', 'MALCOLM-JAMAL', 'WARNER', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'can', 'express', 'enough', 'hatred', 'vile', 'cinematic', 'offering', 'wish', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'Wait', 'wish', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'made', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'tricked', 'thinking', 'could', 'possible', 'enjoy', 'worthless', 'hate', 'films', 'are', 'worthless', 'mean', 'even', 'bad', 'films', 'have', 'SOMETHING', 'justify', 'existence', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'look', 'pretty', 'here.This', 'should', 'have', 'starred', 'sexy', 'beast', 'know', 'who', 'are']",Fool's Gold

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[1, 1]","Before film fans ream me a new one for rating FOOL'S GOLD as an adequate movie, let me explain why I did.It was a loooong day at work. Really long. One of those days where your body feels like a freight train ran it over and your brain's a bowl of oatmeal. You've probably had those days. You just want to come home, unwind, sip a cool one, and sit back in a mindless haze for a while. Ahh!Normally I like films that are bit more visceral and cerebral. But not this day. My mind needed the minimal amount of energy expended in order to ingest something, and Fool's Gold met that need.Yes, we certainly get to see Matthew McConaughey (Tropic Thunder) without his shirt on more times than you can shake a stick at. And Kate Hudson looks mighty nice in those tight fitting clothes and bikini. The ease with which I fell into the story was exactly what I needed to end this rather rough day. And so it goes...Benjamin Finnegan (McConaughey) is an underwater treasure hunter, but he's hit some rough waters. His wife Tess (Hudson) is divorcing him. His boat that's financed by a meanspirited, island-owning rapper has just sunk. And his partner Alfonz (Ewen Bremner,Death at a Funeral) has no qualms about leaving him when things are tough. He's been searching nearly his entire life for something known as The Queen's Dowry, a fortune in treasure that sunk aboard a ship in 1715.

This on the other hand is a new low for all involved, which basically means it's barrel scraps. It's labeled as a romantic comedy, yet their were no real romantic moments, and the majority of the comedy comes from two minor gay cooks. Sure, there are other redeemable elements, but they're few and far between. It's National Treasure at sea, except less exiting, less humorous, and more juvenile (Wow, that's pretty bad). First the bad elements.With the exception of a few Kate Hudson (although I would've preferred another Sarah Jessica Parker outing) and the general rough jerk-persona of Matthew McConaughey, the acting is bad to pathetic. The villains being the worst offenders, with not even that Cosby kid showing one bit of prose. Ray Winstone is bad as always, along with the main villain, Bunny, and his white hired gun. And poor old Donald Sutherland gives possibly the WORST performance of the movie, and/or his career. Matt's sidekick doesn't add to anything either. The story is unoriginal, and obviously little to no thought went into this treasure tale, so I won't dwell on the plot. The action is also mostly uninteresting.Good elements? Well, Donald Sutherland's screen daughter does well as a stupid and ditsy Paris Hilton like character. There is some good humor involved, again mostly coming from two minor gay guys, and a few of Hudson's comments.Amazingly, it could've been much worse, but not by much.

While Matthew is no Kurt Russell, I think Kate is better than her mother ever was. So these two have pretty good chemistry together and then you shoot this movie in the best parts of Australia with great actors like Ray Winstone and Kevin Hart and Donald Sutherland and make it an adventure film, then you've got something really good.

She was happy to be with him for some time, chasing his dreams of finding sunken Spanish treasure, but inevitably he never managed to find gold or strike it rich.  On the day of their wedding annulment, Finn finds a clue that may lead him to the riches that could make him famous and filthy rich, not to mention rekindling his marriage.Once he links back up with Tess, the two go through relationship struggles, quirky scenarios, and with the help of a rich financier (Sutherland) and his dim-witted daughter Gemma (Dziena), they seek to find their treasures.  Facing an unscrupulous and criminal opponent nicknamed Bigg Bunny (Hart) - as well as his mischievous and sometimes bumbling crew - the dangerous race is on for the treasure.Even though this is a complete rip-off of Into the Blue, and Kate Hudson is nowhere near Jessica Alba, it's a decent date movie nonetheless.  Whereas Into the Blue took the drama/suspense angle, Fool's Gold goes the romantic dramedy route.  With a few good laughs, a not-so-deep plot (and an appropriate title), the next move is constantly predictable, and it never really has a chance of being hilarious or memorable in any specific way.  Perhaps if the cocaine addicted sharks from Into the Blue were used, and Hudson was replaced with Alba, then this would be more highly regarded.

1137744,A3LZBOBV9H1HDV,B0012KJ0DK,"Kris King ""Kristopher""","[0, 0]","""Fool's Gold"" is great! This is how the story goes: Ben ""Finn"" Finnegan is a good-natured, surf bum-turned-treasure hunter who is obsessed with finding the legendary 18th century Queen's Dowry--40 chests of exotic treasure that was lost at sea in 1715. In his quest, Finn has sunk everything he has, including his marriage to Tess Finnegan and his more-rusty-than-trusty salvage boat, ""Booty Calls."" Just as Tess has begun to rebuild her life, working aboard a mega-yacht owned by billionaire Nigel Honeycutt, Finn discovers a vital clue to the treasure's whereabouts. Certain that his luck will change with the newfound information, Finn maneuvers himself aboard Nigel's yacht and, using his good-natured charm, convinces the tycoon and his Blackberry-wielding, celebutante daughter, Gemma, to join him in the pursuit of the Spanish treasure. Against Tess' better judgment, the search rekindles her love... of discovery. But they are not the only ones after the treasure. Finn's mentor-turned-nemesis Moe Fitch has also set out to claim the prize. The cast led by Matthew McConaughey (as Finn) and Kate Hudson (as Tess), both who also starred in ""How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days"" (2003) is great! The directing by Andy Tennant (who also directed ""Hitch"" (2005) & ""Sweet Home Alabama"" (2002) is great! The story by John Clafin & Daniel Zelman is great! The screenplay by Clafin, Zelman, & Tennant is great! The music by George Fenton (who also did the music to ""Hitch"" & ""Sweet Home Alabama"") is great!

The art direction by Damien Drew (who also did the art direction to ""Superman Returns"" (2006) is excellent!

They still had the same chemistry but instead of being really outrightly hillarious, it was more silly than anything.  It's a predictable mystery movie rather than being a completely romantic comedy and you really felt as if you were the ones on a treasure hunt.  I thought Donald Sutherland was very good in here and I also thought that Kate did a great job with her physical comedy and also the location was stunning.You have to see this for yourself to make up your own mind.  It would seem that people are fairly much evenly divided between loving and hating it, and I'm somewhere in the middle.  Go see this expecting some funny stupidity and a few good one liners and not expect Oscar material from it.  It's definately a DVD movie rather than a movie theatre viewing.

Too bad, since the love story aspect thankfully took a backseat to the action/adventure.A pair of minor complaints. Unlike her mom, I've never found Kate Hudson either sexy or particularly funny. So that hampered the romantic aspects in my opinion. A case where the echo isn't as clear and crisp as the voice.And this appears to be another walk-through role by Donald Sutherland, who seems to be doing a lot of paycheck appearances lately. Not too long ago I wasted some funds on what looked like a promising Anglo-Sino production. Rented entirely on his featured spot on the cover artwork for ""Big Shot's Funeral"", a flick where he was on screen for a grand total of two minutes - and not even a continuous two minutes.I know that Matt would like a wider audience, but I don't see any real issue with him being this generation's Tom Selleck - handsome, funny, but not an actor known for great range. And there's nothing wrong with making a solid living, as Selleck has proven these past 40 years. He continues to perform well past what would've been career enders for so many his 'face' peers.

Hudson plays his longsuffering wife who fancies herself an intellectual and therefore has filed for divorce from a man who is all brawn and no brains and who is always off chasing rainbows when he should be at home with the woman he loves.To say that ""Fool's Gold"" lands on the screen with a resounding thud would be to minimize its awfulness.  McConaughey and Hudson, both highly attractive performers under other circumstances, are here reduced to flailing around like mad and mugging for the camera just to cover up for the fact that there is not a single clever or witty line in a screenplay that takes a full one-hour-and-fifty-two minutes to play itself out - a screenplay, incidentally, in which every single black character is either a rap star, an armed-to-the-teeth cutthroat or both (the gays don`t fare much better, come to think of it, as they`re all portrayed as ninnies and cowards).  In supporting roles, Donald Sutherland and Malcolm-Jamal Warner also wind up getting trapped in the wreckage.Unfortunately, for all those involved in ""Fool`s Gold,"" the boats aren't the only things sinking in this film.",2,dreadful romantic adventure film,1238284800,"03 29, 2009",2009,1770,"['appropriately', 'titled', 'Fool', 'Gold', 'lame', 'thoroughly', 'hopeless', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'sole', 'purpose', 'existence', 'allow', 'watch', 'couple', 'impossibly', 'beautiful', 'people', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'romping', 'around', 'impossibly', 'beautiful', 'setting', 'Caribbean', 'Sea', '.McConaughey', 'increasingly', 'frivolous', 'roles', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'seemed', 'have', 'ambition', 'be', 'actual', 'actor', 'down-on-his-luck', 'treasure', 'salvager', 'who', 'uncovered', 'whereabouts', 'vast', 'fortune', 'Queen', 'Spain', 'dowry', 'be', 'exact', 'was', 'lost', 'shipwreck', 'coast', 'Florida', 'early', '1700s', 'Hudson', 'longsuffering', 'wife', 'who', 'intellectual', 'therefore', 'filed', 'divorce', 'man', 'who', 'brawn', 'brains', 'who', 'always', 'chasing', 'rainbows', 'when', 'should', 'be', 'home', 'woman', 'say', 'Fool', 'Gold', 'screen', 'resounding', 'thud', 'would', 'be', 'minimize', 'awfulness', 'McConaughey', 'Hudson', 'highly', 'attractive', 'performers', 'other', 'circumstances', 'are', 'here', 'reduced', 'flailing', 'mad', 'mugging', 'camera', 'just', 'cover', 'up', 'fact', 'not', 'single', 'clever', 'witty', 'line', 'screenplay', 'full', 'one-hour-and-fifty-two', 'minutes', 'play', 'out', 'screenplay', 'incidentally', 'single', 'black', 'character', 'rap', 'star', 'armed-to-the-teeth', 'cutthroat', 'gays', 'don', 't', 'fare', 'much', 'better', 'come', 'think', 're', 'portrayed', 'ninnies', 'cowards', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Malcolm-Jamal', 'Warner', 'also', 'wind', 'up', 'getting', 'trapped', 'wreckage.Unfortunately', 'involved', 'Fool', 's', 'Gold', 'boats', 'are', ""n't"", 'only', 'things', 'sinking', 'film']",Fool's Gold

The treasure-seeking story doesn't have to be believable as long as the film is fun to watch. I liked Matthew McConaughey's ""Sahara"" for what it was: good, clean fun of watching our hero doing what he is expected to do. I'm sorry to say this, but for me ""Fool's Gold"" turned out a disappointing entry from Matthew McConaughey who deserves a much better film.Matthew McConaughey is a treasure hunter Finn, who is rather single-mindedly pursuing his dream - a Spanish ship loaded with gold, which has been lost for 300 years off the coast of Florida. Kate Hudson is his wife Tess, now divorcing him as she wants a new life in college. The story is all too familiar, but not bad. However, Andy Tennant, usually a competent director (whose CV includes ""Hitch"" and ""Ever After"") tells the story in an awfully slow and confusing way.""Fool's Gold"" tries to be an action-adventure-comedy-romance, but it becomes none of them. There really isn't much thrilling action to speak of, let alone thrilling adventures. To make matters worse, there isn't much comedy or romance either. The film suffers contrived situations, confusing subplots and lack of style. The action/adventures become abruptly violent as characters get shot in the foot or harpooned in the thigh. Romance or love-hate relationship of Tess and Finn doesn't convince as they talk a lot about treasures and love, but either character (with their long, boring dialogues) doesn't really look serious about what he or she is talking about.Both stars look great, it is true, and they are clearly having a good time. But Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson, formerly seen together as the leads of a romantic comedy ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days,"" does not have enough on-screen chemistry together to make us really care. Probably they are not to be blamed, but the weak script is, as it contains so many detracting factors. Stereotypical characters--Ewen Bremmer as British sidekick; Donald Sutherland as eccentric billionaire and Kevin Hart as murderous gangster (or rap star), etc--do not help, nor lack of coherent storyline that goes on and on, not knowing where to go. And as to the annoying, bikini-clad ""Gemma Honeycutt"" character, what can I say?""Fool's Gold"" is a missed opportunity. It could have been more enjoyable like ""Romancing the Stone,"" which was fun with two likable leads (and their charisma as stars), beautiful locations and story full of adventures.

Donald Sutherland plays Hudson's new rich boss and Alexis Dziena is Sutherland's bimbo-ish daughter. Ray Winstone and Kevin Hart also factor in as potential villains.If you can imagine serious island-thrillers like ""The Deep"" & the two ""Into the Blue"" flicks mixed with a heavy dose of comedy and cartooney action you'd have a good idea of ""Fool's Gold."" It's basically ""The Goonies"" as adults in the Bahamas.Kate and McConaughey look great and are great together, and everyone else is likable, even the villains (sort of). The problem is the film is way too long at 112 minutes. A silly, fun film like this should never go over the 90 minute mark, meaning ""Fool's Gold"" is at least 22 minutes overlong.The story takes place in (or near) the Bahamas, but the film was shot on the east coast of Queensland, and you can tell. The coast ofQueensland is gorgeous but it lacks the lushness of the Caribbean.
