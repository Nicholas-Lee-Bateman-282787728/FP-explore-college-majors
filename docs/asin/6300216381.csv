221055,A36HN1NO7CV072,6300216381,"Amazon Customer ""grenadines""","[11, 11]","When Berry Gordy announced that Diana Ross was to play Billie Holiday in a biopic, jazz ""purists"" were outraged.  They blasted that the ""plastic princess of pop"" couldn't possibly play Lady Day for the following reasons:1 There was no physical resemblance between Lady Day and Diana - Billie wasn't a slim woman.2 Diana's musical heritage haled from a different era to Holiday's.3 At the age of 28, Diana simply hadn't been on the planet long enough to even dream of portraying one of the greatest jazz singers who ever lived.  How dare she!So, it was clear from the outset that Diana had a lot to prove, and that there were critics who were itching to see her and Motown fall flat on their faces.  When Lady Sings the Blues premiered in the US, Diana proved the critics wrong.  I must say, that I was around 12 or 13 (in the early 80s) when I watched this movie for the first time on British TV.  At that time, I had no idea who Billie Holiday was.  I was bowled over by Diana's electric performance, and this prompted me to buy Holiday's music and learn more about her turbulent life.The film is loosely based on Holiday's autobiography.  Holiday's three husbands were whittled down to just one - Louis MacKay, played brilliantly by Diana's co-star, Billie Dee Williams.  The first scene of Holiday being thrown into a padded cell like a piece of meat - and then going completely crazy before being restrained in a straight jacket- sets the tone for the movie.  Billie's mind then travels back in time to her teenage years, when she worked in a brothel in Baltimore.Billie's love affair with music ignites when she's sent to Harlem by her mother to meet a ""Sister Edson from church"".  What her mother didn't know was that Sister Edson ran a brothel of her own.  Billie wanders around the neighbourhood where she slips into a nightclub.  To her, it was the most amazing place she'd ever been to.  It's here that she sets eyes on Louis MacKay for the first time, and falls in love with him.The movie's a roller coaster ride through Billie's jazz and blues career, her drug addiction, arrests, and it climaxes with the majestic, emotional finale.  Diana's acting performance was superb - she threw herself into the role, and it was clear that she was touched by Billie's life.  There are certain scenes where Diana simply screams `gimme an Oscar!' especially when Billie withdraws in her padded cell, with her doctor and Louis doing everything they can to help her - it's a touching and desperately sad scene.  There are other scenes: the one where she and Louis have a fight over her bag of heroine is ferocious. ...Gripping stuff!Diana's interpretations of Holiday's songs were outstanding. She didn't attempt to impersonate Holiday, yet she managed to capture the emotion and mood of each song with great effect.  Her razor sharp phrasing and crystal clear diction were stunning - even to the point of being eerie.  Just listen to ""Strange Fruit"" (not the most comfortable song to listen to).  The music score, written by Michael Legrand, and conducted by Gil Askey, is beautiful, sweeping and moving.Credit must also go to the support cast.  Billie Dee Williams and Diana have great on-screen chemistry.  They teamed up again for ""Mahogany"" and ""Red Hot Rhythm & Blues"". Richard Prior was hilarious as the Piano Man, and he provided a bit of light relief.  James Callahan deserves a mention too, as the caring Reg.  Billie's mother, Mama Holiday, is played sympathetically by Virginia Capers.While this movie is not a totally authentic account of Billie Holiday's life, I feel that Diana captures the essence of her legend.  At the end of the movie, I sensed that Holiday was beautiful, talented, vulnerable and complex.  Most of all, she was a human being who battled with the many demons in her life. In the end, that battle proved too much for her.Lady Sings the Blues was nominated for 5 Academy Awards, including ""Best Actress"" for Ross.  She didn't win, but I don't think it mattered - the film speaks for itself, and being nominated - in the leading female category - was a great achievement.  All was not lost, however as Ross picked up a Golden Globe for her performance, plus a host of other awards.It's a shame that Diana didn't get the guidance of a strong film director after Lady Sings the Blues.  However, Diana's outstanding performance in ""Out of Darkness"" restored her reputation as talented actress, and proved that with the right material, she could rise to the challenge.I have no hesitation of recommending this movie.A note for UK viewers: you'll need a VHS with NTSC playback to watch this movie.",5,Diana Ross in her knockout film debut,1049414400,"04 4,

She is a legend and an icon she is multi-talented she was with one of the most legendary female musical groups of all time with the legendary motown records she has achieved much success has done just about everything and has been seen with just about everyone and also has performed with many legendary artsits such as Stevie Wonder, Lionel Richie, she did outstanding performances with Marvin Gaye and she is a founding member of the supergirl group &quot;The Supremes&quot; this woman is the true meaning of what you call a &quot;diva&quot; and by the way the most of her men are and were very successful to name a few. But she isn't perfect just like everyone we all have flaws.  But I don't know anyone who has achieved as much stardom as this woman has and in this movie she does an outstanding performance as Billie Holiday  she sings with Beauty,Style,and Grace and she has that naturally but in this movie she does some superb acting .  Her acting was so good I was really beginning to think that she was the real Billie Holiday so therefore Diana delivered in this role and she played her part wonderfully. and Co-starred her was Richard Pryor he did an exceptional job another multi-talented african american a legendary comic who is and will always be my favorite comedian!!!! And alongside Diana, and Richard co-starred Billy Dee Williams a very handsome man back in the days and he is still very nice looking today and he still has that voice that can light a fireplace so therefore if you are a fan of anyone of these people mentioned and a huge fan of Diana Ross and Billie Holiday I would truly recommend you to buy this video it is excptional!!!!",5,Fabulous Perfomance acting,1065571200,"10 8, 2003",2003,1749,"['Miss', 'Ross', 'can', 'sing', 'dance', 'act', 'beauty', 'style', 'grace', 'legend', 'icon', 'multi-talented', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'legendary', 'female', 'musical', 'groups', 'time', 'legendary', 'motown', 'records', 'achieved', 'much', 'success', 'done', 'just', 'everything', 'been', 'seen', 'just', 'everyone', 'also', 'performed', 'many', 'legendary', 'artsits', 'such', 'Stevie', 'Wonder', 'Lionel', 'Richie', 'did', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'Marvin', 'Gaye', 'founding', 'member', 'supergirl', 'group', 'quot', 'Supremes', 'quot', 'woman', 'true', 'meaning', 'what', 'call', 'quot', 'quot', 'way', 'most', 'men', 'are', 'were', 'very', 'successful', 'name', 'few', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'just', 'everyone', 'have', 'flaws', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anyone', 'who', 'achieved', 'much', 'stardom', 'woman', 'movie', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'Billie', 'Holiday', 'Beauty', 'Style', 'Grace', 'naturally', 'movie', 'superb', 'acting', 'acting', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'was', 'really', 'beginning', 'think', 'was', 'real', 'Billie', 'Holiday', 'therefore', 'Diana', 'delivered', 'role', 'played', 'part', 'wonderfully', 'Co-starred', 'was', 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'did', 'exceptional', 'job', 'multi-talented', 'african', 'american', 'legendary', 'comic', 'who', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'favorite', 'comedian', 'alongside', 'Diana', 'Richard', 'co-starred', 'Billy', 'Dee', 'Williams', 'very', 'handsome', 'man', 'back', 'days', 'still', 'very', 'nice', 'looking', 'today', 'still', 'voice', 'can', 'light', 'fireplace', 'so', 'therefore', 'are', 'fan', 'anyone', 'people', 'mentioned', 'huge', 'fan', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'Billie', 'Holiday', 'would', 'truly', 'recommend', 'buy', 'video', 'excptional']",N/A
221060,ANGH6401L9Y0T,6300216381,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[2, 3]","I tried twice. I simply cannot watch the whole thing again. It's just too depressing. Also, even though I know it's mostly a true story, I simply cannot believe that any woman lucky enough to have Billy Dee Williams in love with her would ever do anything to risk that relationship.Well, that's not entirely true. I know how potent addiction can be, but it leaves me very little respect for Diana Ross in her role as Billie Holliday. But I love Holliday's music, and don't want to lose respect for her. So it makes my stomach knot up, and I have to turn it off.In fact, the movie starts with Billie being thrown into a padded cell, going cold turkey. Most of the rest of the movie is flash-back.Her mother sent her off to work for one of the ladies she knew from church, assuming she was a respectable woman. No, she was a madam. Billie cleaned the House, but was soon doing the same work as the rest of the girls who lived there. She learned to sing by listening to phonograph records on one of those old wind-up Victrolas.One day, she notices a sign saying a local club needs a dancer, so she presents herself as a dancer. That didn't fool anyone, but she told Pianoman (Richard Pryor) that she could sing, and he persuaded the boss to give her an audition as a singer. Of course she was good, so he hired her.What he neglected to tell her was how the tips were made. A patron would fold a dollar bill lengthwise, set it on the edge of the table with maybe a third of it over the edge. The singer would raise her skirt (or wear a slit skirt) and catch the bill between her thighs. But Billie was way too nervous, and finally Louis McKay (Billy Dee Williams, looking like a million bucks before taxes) holds out a bill for her to simply take in her hands. After he sets the precedent, so do other patrons. That's apparently how she got the nickname Lady: too much of a lady to pick it up with her thighs.Billie and Louis fall in love, obviously. But she goes on the road with an all-white band and hardly ever sees him. It is the palest, whitest member of the band who introduces her to heroin.Her career goes up and down along with her health, and eventually McKay puts her into a real rehabilitation program -- the one pictured at the beginning of the movie. She seems to get clean and has one more comeback, but we all know she eventually died of the stuff.Sorry; I can't provide much in the way of details. Diana Ross is way too skinny to play Billie, who was somewhat plump from the beginning. But she is beautiful, and has some superb costumes. Billy D, as I said, looks delicious throughout. And of course, Ross can indeed sing. So it's not an altogether wasted movie, especially with Richard Prior doing some very clever improv with Ross in a scene where they are both very stoned and are attempting to disguise the fact. In a way, it's really funny; in another, it's simply heartbreaking.If you know anyone who doesn't believe drugs can ruin your life, show them this movie.",2,"Quite Well Acted, But Terribly Depressing",1336953600,"05 14, 2012",2012,2984,"['tried', 'twice', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'watch', 'whole', 'thing', 'again', 'just', 'too', 'depressing', 'Also', 'even', 'know', 'mostly', 'true', 'story', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'woman', 'lucky', 'enough', 'have', 'Billy', 'Dee', 'Williams', 'love', 'would', 'ever', 'do', 'anything', 'risk', 'relationship.Well', 'not', 'entirely', 'true', 'know', 'how', 'potent', 'addiction', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'little', 'respect', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'role', 'Billie', 'Holliday', 'love', 'Holliday', 'music', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'lose', 'respect', 'stomach', 'knot', 'up', 'have', 'turn', 'off.In', 'fact', 'movie', 'Billie', 'being', 'thrown', 'padded', 'cell', 'going', 'cold', 'turkey', 'Most', 'rest', 'movie', 'flash-back.Her', 'mother', 'sent', 'off', 'work', 'one', 'ladies', 'knew', 'church', 'assuming', 'was', 'respectable', 'woman', 'No', 'was', 'madam', 'Billie', 'cleaned', 'House', 'was', 'soon', 'doing', 'same', 'work', 'rest', 'girls', 'who', 'lived', 'there', 'learned', 'sing', 'listening', 'phonograph', 'records', 'one', 'old', 'wind-up', 'Victrolas.One', 'day', 'sign', 'saying', 'local', 'club', 'dancer', 'dancer', 'did', ""n't"", 'fool', 'anyone', 'told', 'Pianoman', 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'could', 'sing', 'persuaded', 'boss', 'give', 'audition', 'singer', 'course', 'was', 'good', 'hired', 'her.What', 'neglected', 'tell', 'was', 'how', 'tips', 'were', 'made', 'patron', 'would', 'fold', 'dollar', 'bill', 'lengthwise', 'set', 'edge', 'table', 'maybe', 'third', 'edge', 'singer', 'would', 'raise', 'skirt', 'wear', 'slit', 'skirt', 'catch', 'bill', 'thighs', 'Billie', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'nervous', 'finally', 'Louis', 'McKay', 'Billy', 'Dee', 'Williams', 'looking', 'million', 'bucks', 'taxes', 'out', 'bill', 'simply', 'take', 'hands', 'precedent', 'so', 'do', 'other', 'patrons', 'apparently', 'how', 'got', 'nickname', 'Lady', 'too', 'much', 'lady', 'pick', 'up', 'thighs.Billie', 'Louis', 'fall', 'love', 'obviously', 'road', 'all-white', 'band', 'hardly', 'ever', 'palest', 'whitest', 'member', 'band', 'who', 'heroin.Her', 'career', 'up', 'down', 'along', 'health', 'eventually', 'McKay', 'real', 'rehabilitation', 'program', 'one', 'pictured', 'beginning', 'movie', 'get', 'clean', 'one', 'more', 'comeback', 'know', 'eventually', 'died', 'stuff.Sorry', 'ca', ""n't"", 'provide', 'much', 'way', 'details', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'way', 'too', 'skinny', 'play', 'Billie', 'who', 'was', 'somewhat', 'plump', 'beginning', 'beautiful', 'superb', 'costumes', 'Billy', 'D', 'said', 'delicious', 'course', 'Ross', 'can', 'indeed', 'sing', 'not', 'altogether', 'wasted', 'movie', 'especially', 'Richard', 'Prior', 'doing', 'very', 'clever', 'improv', 'Ross', 'scene', 'where', 'are', 'very', 'stoned', 'are', 'attempting', 'disguise', 'fact', 'way', 'really', 'funny', 'simply', 'heartbreaking.If', 'know', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'believe', 'drugs', 'can', 'ruin', 'life', 'show', 'movie']",N/A

Being a huge fan of Motown music I was less than thrilled though when I heard that Diana Ross was going to portray the troubled and brilliant jazz legend but out of curiosity ran to see ""Lady Sings The Blues"" the week of its release and was totally impressed with the drama and pathos created by the great performances contained in this ground-breaking motion picture that also made a romantic leading man out of Billy Dee Williams plus Richard Pryor gives a winning performance as well.  Diana Ross is simply tremendous and amazing to watch in this moody atmospheric motion picture classic that still holds up today as an engrossing drama of a singer who had brilliant and uniquely original talent but made all the wrong choices in life...Bravo to everyone involved with this earthy and deeply moving and yes somewhat troubling and disturbing classic!!! Diana Ross and Liza Minnelli both gave magnificent career defining performances the same year and these grand and legendary performers should have gone on to greater heights in motion pictures but a burned-out Hollywood no longer knew how to put together great projects for great female talent and this sadly still holds true today!  Since the 70's a legendary screen career such as a Bette Davis, Joan Crawford, Judy Garland, etc. would not or could not have happened and this is a sad loss to the audience and those many artists whose career's have floundered with their wonderful talent left untapped...Hollywood in many ways has really lost the way and movies today for the most part look and feel completely fake and manufactured...""Lady Sings The Blues"" is from another era where talent reined supreme and this era is sadly gone and it would take nothing short of a miracle for it to return.",5,ELECTRIFYING  PERFORMANCE~BRAVO DIANA!!!,1152662400,"07 12, 2006",2006,2293,"['early', '70', 'jazz', 'legend', 'Billie', 'Holiday', 'had', 'been', 'gone', 'decade', 'harrowing', 'life', 'was', 'truly', 'incredible', 'story', 'was', 'bound', 'hit', 'big', 'screen', 'first', 'choice', 'play', 'Lady', 'Day', 'was', 'magnificent', 'Jazz/Soul/Pop', 'legend', 'Nancy', 'Wilson', 'who', 'had', 'just', 'turned', 'passionate', 'impressive', 'guest', 'star', 'performance', 'singer', 'strung', 'out', 'one', 'popular', 'television', 'dramatic', 'series', 'looked', 'was', 'shoo-in', 'plum', 'role', 'was', 'Diana', 'who', 'had', 'Berry', 'Gordy', 'moment', 'was', 'ticket', 'Being', 'huge', 'fan', 'Motown', 'music', 'was', 'less', 'thrilled', 'when', 'heard', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'was', 'going', 'portray', 'troubled', 'brilliant', 'jazz', 'legend', 'curiosity', 'ran', 'see', 'Lady', 'Sings', 'Blues', 'week', 'release', 'was', 'totally', 'impressed', 'drama', 'pathos', 'created', 'great', 'performances', 'contained', 'ground-breaking', 'motion', 'picture', 'also', 'made', 'romantic', 'leading', 'man', 'Billy', 'Dee', 'Williams', 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'winning', 'performance', 'as', 'well', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'simply', 'tremendous', 'amazing', 'watch', 'moody', 'atmospheric', 'motion', 'picture', 'still', 'up', 'today', 'engrossing', 'drama', 'singer', 'who', 'had', 'brilliant', 'uniquely', 'original', 'talent', 'made', 'wrong', 'choices', 'life', 'Bravo', 'everyone', 'involved', 'earthy', 'deeply', 'moving', 'yes', 'somewhat', 'troubling', 'disturbing', 'classic', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'Liza', 'Minnelli', 'gave', 'magnificent', 'career', 'defining', 'performances', 'same', 'year', 'grand', 'legendary', 'performers', 'should', 'have', 'gone', 'greater', 'heights', 'motion', 'pictures', 'burned-out', 'Hollywood', 'no', 'longer', 'knew', 'how', 'put', 'together', 'great', 'projects', 'great', 'female', 'talent', 'sadly', 'still', 'true', 'today', '70', 'legendary', 'screen', 'career', 'such', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'etc', 'would', 'not', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'happened', 'sad', 'loss', 'audience', 'many', 'artists', 'career', 'have', 'floundered', 'wonderful', 'talent', 'left', 'untapped', 'Hollywood', 'many', 'ways', 'really', 'lost', 'way', 'movies', 'today', 'most', 'part', 'look', 'feel', 'completely', 'fake', 'manufactured', 'Lady', 'Sings', 'Blues', 'era', 'where', 'talent', 'reined', 'supreme', 'era', 'sadly', 'gone', 'would', 'take', 'nothing', 'short', 'miracle', 'return']",N/A

Some visual images used in the movie are quite intense and emotionally riveting. They make it easy to understand how the 'blues' are truly experienced.Ms Ross's smooth jazzy vocals resonate the soundtrack with a contrasting clarity to Holiday's original recordings but superbly capture the emotional intensity of Billie's vaccilating depression and addiction.Billy Dee Williams and Richard Pryor are excellent in supporting roles. Williams provides the love and compassion that just aren't enough to rescue Holiday from the depths of her addiction. Pryor and Scatman Crothers (in a small role) add some islands of comic relief to the generally depressed mood.Lady Sings the Blues is for those who want to get a glimpse of the tragic life of Billy Holiday.

221072,A3PPSZB0W5DZH6,6300216381,"DEWEY M. ""MOVIE & MUSICAL THEATRE MAN""","[3, 4]","Early on in ""Lady Sings The Blues"" (1972), 14 year old Billie Holiday is raped by a drunken bum. Her story goes downhill from there. After scrubbing the steps of a Harlem bordello, she goes to work as a prostitute for a while. Billie eventually becomes a singer and a drug addict. It is Billie Holiday, the drug addict that the film is most interested in. I recall film critic Pauline Kael stating, in her review, it seemed that nobody involved in ""Lady"" had any love for Billie Holiday; except for star Diana Ross.In biopics, a certain amount of dramatic license is acceptable. But the screenplay, by Terence McCloy, Chris Clark and Suzanne de Pass, takes so many liberties with, and shows such a blatent disregard for, the truth, the movie almost qualifies as a work of pure fiction. In her book (on which the film is allegedly based), Billie says it was her own choice to take drugs. A self-destructive choice, certainly, but her own choice, nevertheless. In the film, a devious white musician named Harry (Paul Hampton) gets her hooked on heroin. In real life, Billie toured with Artie Shaw and his band. In the film, she tours with the fictious Reg Handley (James Callahan) and his band.  Louis McKay (Billy Dee Williams) is portrayed as Billie's would-be Prince Charming and protector. According to record producer John Hammond, Billie was often afraid of Louis and tried to hide from him. Given that the real Louis McKay served as a technical consultant on the film, it is perhaps understandable that his character is altered. And, given the potent chemistry between Billy Dee Williams and Diana Ross, executive producer Berry Gordy probably wanted to inject more romance into the story. But the movie hardly qualifies as a romance. It isn't even much of a biopic. But the film narrative does make the case that Billie Holiday became a drug addict as a reaction to the horrorific racisim she experienced throughout her lifetime.Diana Ross rises far above the mess of a movie.  Her performance is dynamic and miraculous. Diana Ross, not the movie, makes you feel and understand Billie Holiday's confusion, anger, lonliness, vulnerability, and pain. And boy, do we ever feel her PAIN. Director Sidney J. Furie seems to delight in long scenes of absolute agony. There is a harrowing scene where Billie witnesses the aftermath of a lynching; inspiring her most controversial song ""Strange Fruit."" There is another harrowing scene where Billie's tour bus is attacked by the Klu Kluk Klan. In fact, the film is one harrowing, nightmarish scene after another: Billie fighting Louis for her fix, Billie shooting up, Billie going through numerous drug withdrawls, and Piano Man (Richard Pryor in a solid dramatic performance) being beaten to death. The movie is ultimately so depressing and brutal it becomes gratuitous and explotive.There is also music in the mix. Diana Ross made a decision not to copy Billie Holiday's sound, but she certainly absorbed Billie's intonation and style; particularly singing ""Good Morning Heartache"" and ""God Bless The Child"". Berry Gordy reportedly told Diana to sound less like Billie Holiday and more like herself; resulting in the criticism that the film made Billie Holiday's  signature songs sound more Motown than classic 1930's-1940's jazz standards.Diana Ross is the saving grace in this flawed film. She deservedly received an Academy Award nomination as Best Actress. But, in 1972, Hollywood was still backward and not willing to give an African-American actress the award. (Ciceily Tyson was also nominated the same year for her role in ""Sounder""). Thus, Liza Minnelli won the award for her intense, but far less demanding, role in ""Cabaret."" That's unfortunate because, although Billie Holiday deserved a far better biopic, Diana Ross definitely deserved the award for portraying her.",3,"""DIANA ROSS IS DYNAMIC AND MIRACULOUS, BUT THE MOVIE IS A MESS.""",1274745600,"05 25, 2010",2010,3828,"['Early', 'Lady', 'Blues', '1972', '14', 'year', 'old', 'Billie', 'Holiday', 'raped', 'drunken', 'bum', 'story', 'downhill', 'there', 'scrubbing', 'steps', 'Harlem', 'bordello', 'work', 'prostitute', 'while', 'Billie', 'eventually', 'singer', 'drug', 'addict', 'Billie', 'Holiday', 'drug', 'addict', 'film', 'most', 'interested', 'recall', 'film', 'critic', 'Pauline', 'Kael', 'stating', 'review', 'seemed', 'nobody', 'involved', 'Lady', 'had', 'love', 'Billie', 'Holiday', 'star', 'Diana', 'Ross.In', 'biopics', 'certain', 'amount', 'dramatic', 'license', 'acceptable', 'screenplay', 'Terence', 'McCloy', 'Chris', 'Clark', 'Suzanne', 'de', 'Pass', 'so', 'many', 'liberties', 'shows', 'such', 'blatent', 'disregard', 'truth', 'movie', 'almost', 'qualifies', 'work', 'pure', 'fiction', 'book', 'film', 'allegedly', 'based', 'Billie', 'was', 'own', 'choice', 'take', 'drugs', 'self-destructive', 'choice', 'certainly', 'own', 'choice', 'nevertheless', 'film', 'devious', 'white', 'musician', 'named', 'Harry', 'Paul', 'Hampton', 'hooked', 'heroin', 'real', 'life', 'Billie', 'toured', 'Artie', 'Shaw', 'band', 'film', 'fictious', 'Reg', 'Handley', 'James', 'Callahan', 'band', 'Louis', 'McKay', 'Billy', 'Dee', 'Williams', 'portrayed', 'Billie', 'would-be', 'Prince', 'Charming', 'protector', 'According', 'record', 'producer', 'John', 'Hammond', 'Billie', 'was', 'often', 'afraid', 'Louis', 'tried', 'hide', 'Given', 'real', 'Louis', 'McKay', 'served', 'technical', 'consultant', 'film', 'perhaps', 'understandable', 'character', 'altered', 'given', 'potent', 'chemistry', 'Billy', 'Dee', 'Williams', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'executive', 'producer', 'Berry', 'Gordy', 'probably', 'wanted', 'inject', 'more', 'romance', 'story', 'movie', 'hardly', 'romance', ""n't"", 'even', 'much', 'biopic', 'film', 'narrative', 'make', 'case', 'Billie', 'Holiday', 'became', 'drug', 'addict', 'reaction', 'horrorific', 'experienced', 'lifetime.Diana', 'Ross', 'far', 'mess', 'movie', 'performance', 'dynamic', 'miraculous', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'not', 'movie', 'feel', 'understand', 'Billie', 'Holiday', 'confusion', 'anger', 'lonliness', 'vulnerability', 'pain', 'boy', 'do', 'ever', 'feel', 'PAIN', 'Director', 'Sidney', 'J.', 'Furie', 'delight', 'long', 'scenes', 'absolute', 'agony', 'harrowing', 'scene', 'where', 'Billie', 'aftermath', 'lynching', 'inspiring', 'most', 'controversial', 'song', 'Strange', 'Fruit', 'harrowing', 'scene', 'where', 'Billie', 'tour', 'bus', 'attacked', 'Klu', 'Kluk', 'Klan', 'fact', 'film', 'one', 'harrowing', 'nightmarish', 'scene', 'Billie', 'fighting', 'Louis', 'fix', 'Billie', 'shooting', 'up', 'Billie', 'going', 'numerous', 'drug', 'withdrawls', 'Piano', 'Man', 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'solid', 'dramatic', 'performance', 'being', 'beaten', 'death', 'movie', 'ultimately', 'so', 'depressing', 'brutal', 'gratuitous', 'also', 'music', 'mix', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'made', 'decision', 'not', 'copy', 'Billie', 'Holiday', 'sound', 'certainly', 'absorbed', 'Billie', 'intonation', 'style', 'particularly', 'singing', 'Good', 'Morning', 'Heartache', 'God', 'Bless', 'Child', 'Berry', 'Gordy', 'reportedly', 'told', 'Diana', 'sound', 'less', 'Billie', 'Holiday', 'more', 'resulting', 'criticism', 'film', 'made', 'Billie', 'Holiday', 'signature', 'sound', 'more', 'Motown', 'classic', ""1930's-1940"", 'jazz', 'standards.Diana', 'Ross', 'saving', 'grace', 'flawed', 'film', 'deservedly', 'received', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Actress', '1972', 'Hollywood', 'was', 'still', 'backward', 'not', 'willing', 'give', 'African-American', 'actress', 'award', 'Ciceily', 'Tyson', 'was', 'also', 'nominated', 'same', 'year', 'role', 'Sounder', 'Thus', 'Liza', 'Minnelli', 'won', 'award', 'intense', 'far', 'less', 'demanding', 'role', 'Cabaret', 'unfortunate', 'Billie', 'Holiday', 'deserved', 'far', 'better', 'biopic', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'definitely', 'deserved', 'award', 'portraying']",N/A

I don't know that the film is technically a musical, but it is the closest thing to one I can think of, that I completely enjoyed.Having watched it on the small screen, I can say that a fair amount of the majesty of the film is lost, but the performances are still just as satisfying today as they were in 1972.Update--1 July 2008: If this review was not helpful to you, I would appreciate learning the reason(s) so I can improve my reviews.

It's like if Usher suddenly gave the performance Jamie Foxx did in Ray.  It's astonishing she never went on to have a big film career.  Today, people talk about Dorothy Dandridge getting nominated more - for a musical where she didn't even do her own singing.The eerie thing about watching this.

221077,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6300216381,Ed Uyeshima,"[5, 7]","The recent death of Richard Pryor prompted me to look at the 2005 DVD package of 1972's ""Lady Sings the Blues"", which proves the then-young comedian to be a fine actor in the meaty supporting role of Piano Man. Even though he was a master stand-up comic, it's still too bad he never pursued roles of a similar dramatic caliber since he obviously had the talent. Similarly, Diana Ross never fulfilled the promise of her big screen debut in the title role as legendary jazz singer Billie Holiday (1915-59).Bearing no physical and little vocal resemblance to Holiday, Ross somehow gets under her true-life character's skin much like Joaquin Phoenix does in ""Walk the Line"" or Jamie Foxx in ""Ray"". Thirty-three years have elapsed since I first saw this movie, and it is with a certain amount of regret that I report that Ross as an actress has not been anywhere near this good since then. Granted she only has three features under her belt, 1975's ""Mahogany"" reflected an ego run amok, and she was disturbingly miscast in 1978's ""The Wiz"". From the opening scene where she is suffering through heroin withdrawal in raw, harrowing detail to her sultrier nightclub performances, she manages to be incendiary by her sheer will. She is even convincing in the early scenes where she is barely a teenager. Her vocal performances really don't evoke Holiday's earthier style, though to Ross's credit, her vivid renditions of standards such as ""Mean to Me"", ""Fine and Mellow"" and ""Gimme a Pigfoot (and a Bottle of Beer)"" don't sound like Supremes redux either.This achievement is all the more impressive since director Sidney J. Furie, a journeyman filmmaker at best, has surrounded Ross with an unwieldy rags-to-riches biopic that should have been edited down from its 144-minute running time. The screenplay - credited to Chris Clark, Suzanne De Passe and Terence McCloy (none of whom wrote a movie script before or since) based in part on Holiday's autobiography - plays fast and loose with the facts and piles on the clich&eacute;s in true Oscar-baiting fashion. The drug-related scenes are powerful, though they eventually start to feel like condescending plot devices to make the viewer sympathize with Holiday for the persecution she experienced at the hands of abusive men and a bigoted society. Moreover, as Furie discloses on the accompanying audio commentary, the dialogue for several scenes is improvised by the actors, for example, the unnecessarily lengthy Club Manhattan sequence, where the lack of discipline becomes wearing.Contrary to the fact that Holiday's true life story has been well documented and interest in her legacy increased, the filmmakers altered events and people in order to maintain interest from what they thought were mainstream audiences at the time. Consequently, the character of Louis McKay, Holiday's love interest and eventual husband, played with toothsome charm by Billy Dee Williams, synthesizes a lot of men who came into her life and helped shape her career. The dramatized results leave out key figures of the jazz world like saxophonist Lester Young, trombonist Jimmy Monroe to whom Holiday was married, and record producer John Hammond, as well as Benny Goodman, Count Basie, Artie Shaw and Teddy Wilson--all important colleagues and mentors during the period covered in the film. Instead, we are given Holiday's story as filtered through Ross's own story, an observation confirmed by Ross herself on the accompanying 2005 making-of featurette.When the music is true to the period, it's quite wonderful, but composer Michel Legrand composed some gauzy, anachronistic interludes that sound like symphonic outtakes from his work on ""Brian's Song"". The costumes also have a Vegas revue feel, no surprise since designer Bob Mackie's flamboyant, early 1970's style is on full display here. For such an overlong movie, the ending feels quite truncated as newspaper clips are used to telegraph her eventual fate as Ross triumphantly sings her signature song, ""God Bless the Child"", in Carnegie Hall. Credit Motown mogul and Ross's Svengali, Berry Gordy, for having the fortitude, foresight and tenacity to oversee the project, and the DVD hammers that point in not only the overemphatic, only partially insightful commentary by Furie, Gordy and artists' manager Shelly Berger but also the making-of featurette which features Ross looking strangely youthful and Williams at least looking his age. There are several deleted scenes included in the DVD with no additional commentary from Furie, none refurbished and all understandably excised from the final cut.",3,Ross's Truly Once-in-Her-Lifetime

Diana Ross was 28 when she played the part of Billie Holiday and is almost 62 now.  The audience of the time as the actors are much older and newer audiences may not accept this being up to snuff with today's works.Also, I guess many people opt out listening to the commentaries on their DVDs?  If they didn't one would realize that this film was almost shelved and Barry Gordy had to put up $2 million of his own money to complete it.  That when films were made in 1972 it was a different era and racial tension still prevailed.  And this was the ""first"" movie depicting blacks that wasn't a ""black"" movie (aka blaxploitation)  [Note... reviewer Charles Dixon overlooked the meaning in what was said here stating this was the first black movie not made specifically for black audiences].  All this taken into consideration I am sure there were certain creative liberties taken which may not add up being a to-the-letter biography, but tell me one MOVIE title that truly is?  Each have some fiction in them.  With that said...Diana Ross does have some fantastic moments within this film and if for nothing more than pouring her heart out into the roll she deserved the Academy Award nomination.  On the other hand, certain scenes seemed a bit distracting and dysfunctional which was due in part by the producer and director letting the actors improvise unwritten lines and even kept the cameras rolling longer than they should.  This was brought up many times within the commentary.For 1972, it was really pushing the envelope for a black feature film and was also the most expensive up to that time.  It raised the bar for future films but to sell tickets to white audiences, there was some gloss over and even omittances.  Deleted scenes (included on the DVD) that I thought developed characters and situations should have been left in while some of the improvised ramblings could have been trimmed down hence my 4-star rating.All in all, this is a great movie and long overdue on DVD (with a great anamorphic transfer) but if you are looking for an accurate biography about Billie Holiday (Eleanora Fagan 1915-1959), go read a book.  After all, this is just a movie and an entertaining one at that.Sit back with an open mind and enjoy knowing even a little about the tragedy of the jazz legend Billie Holiday as it was filmed in 1972.",4,"Great  ""entertainment""  for a 1972 biopic...",1133654400,"12 4, 2005",2005,2422,"['First', 'film', 'was', 'made', '1972', 'not', '2005', 'movie', 'audiences', 'were', 'different', 'then', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'was', '28', 'when', 'played', 'part', 'Billie', 'Holiday', 'almost', '62', 'now', 'audience', 'time', 'actors', 'are', 'much', 'older', 'newer', 'audiences', 'may', 'not', 'accept', 'being', 'up', 'snuff', 'today', 'works.Also', 'guess', 'many', 'people', 'opt', 'out', 'listening', 'commentaries', 'DVDs', 'did', ""n't"", 'one', 'would', 'realize', 'film', 'was', 'almost', 'shelved', 'Barry', 'Gordy', 'had', 'put', 'up', '2', 'million', 'own', 'money', 'complete', 'when', 'films', 'were', 'made', '1972', 'was', 'different', 'era', 'racial', 'tension', 'still', 'prevailed', 'was', 'first', 'movie', 'depicting', 'blacks', 'was', ""n't"", 'black', 'movie', 'aka', 'blaxploitation', '[', 'Note', 'reviewer', 'Charles', 'Dixon', 'overlooked', 'meaning', 'what', 'was', 'said', 'here', 'stating', 'was', 'first', 'black', 'movie', 'not', 'made', 'specifically', 'black', 'audiences', ']', 'taken', 'consideration', 'am', 'sure', 'were', 'certain', 'creative', 'liberties', 'taken', 'may', 'not', 'add', 'up', 'being', 'to-the-letter', 'biography', 'tell', 'one', 'MOVIE', 'title', 'truly', 'have', 'fiction', 'said', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'have', 'fantastic', 'moments', 'film', 'nothing', 'more', 'pouring', 'heart', 'roll', 'deserved', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'other', 'hand', 'certain', 'scenes', 'seemed', 'bit', 'distracting', 'dysfunctional', 'was', 'due', 'part', 'producer', 'director', 'letting', 'actors', 'improvise', 'unwritten', 'lines', 'even', 'kept', 'cameras', 'rolling', 'longer', 'should', 'was', 'brought', 'up', 'many', 'times', 'commentary.For', '1972', 'was', 'really', 'pushing', 'envelope', 'black', 'feature', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'most', 'expensive', 'up', 'time', 'raised', 'bar', 'future', 'films', 'sell', 'tickets', 'white', 'audiences', 'was', 'gloss', 'even', 'omittances', 'Deleted', 'scenes', 'included', 'DVD', 'thought', 'developed', 'characters', 'situations', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'improvised', 'ramblings', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'trimmed', 'down', 'hence', '4-star', 'rating.All', 'great', 'movie', 'long', 'overdue', 'DVD', 'great', 'anamorphic', 'transfer', 'are', 'looking', 'accurate', 'biography', 'Billie', 'Holiday', 'Eleanora', 'Fagan', '1915-1959', 'go', 'read', 'book', 'just', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'one', 'that.Sit', 'back', 'open', 'mind', 'enjoy', 'knowing', 'even', 'little', 'tragedy', 'jazz', 'legend', 'Billie', 'Holiday', 'was', 'filmed', '1972']",N/A

221084,A1F2IPYSXB0ZCX,6300216381,Ian Phillips,"[2, 2]","Soul music legend Diana Ross broke down many racial barriers between blacks and whites and opened doors for many other black entertainers. The oscar-nominated, critically-acclaimed Lady Sings The Blues (1972) is a prime example of her remarkable achievements.Lady Sings The Blues (1972) is (very) loosley drawn from Billie Holidays startling autobiography (co-written by William Duffy) of the same name though as i'm sure many of you are aware lots of the incidents that take place in the movie are completely fictionalised, re-worked supposedly for dramatic clarity. Die-hard Billie Holiday fans were up in arms for the films often fictionalised account of the tortured Jazz legend but they all rightly joined in to praise Diana Ross's truly dynamic and riviting silver screen debut. Incredibly Diana Ross had never before taken an acting lesson in her life and her only acting credit before this was a guest apperance in the U.S T.V series, Tarzan, playing a singing nun as well as some impressive comedy sketches in her 1971 television special Diana! (which included an amusing sketch with a very young Michael Jackson). Critics (wrongfully) doubted almost immediatley that she could truly carry out this challenging role. However once the film was released, critics were silenced and astounded by Diana's masterful playing.The film follows Billie Holiday (born Eleanora Fagin) as a teenager where she worked as a prostitute in a brothel run by her mothers friend and chronicles her rise and fall of the days greatest Jazz/Blues singer. It largely focuses on her complex relationship with her husband, Louis Mckay, which is superbly played by Billy Dee Williams and details her horrific and physical decline into heroin addiction. There is also a fantastic supporting turn from Richard Pryor as the Piano Man who really bites into his part and makes the most of every scene he's in.However the ultimate fact here is that Diana Ross is the star and she is just amazing! Watching her play those harrowing scenes as Billie goes through cold turkey from her heroin addiction, makes you appreciate her deep, raw talent. Her acting is purley instinctive and as one critic accuratley pointed out that wherever the eyes of the film makers may have been, the heart of it's star was certainly in the right place.Diana doesn't once try and emulate Holidays vocal style, instead making the songs surprisingly her own. She completley escaped and shook off the traditional Motown sound and never does a Supremes-type number. What emerges in her vocal performances on the films soundtrack is some of her strongest and most passionate work. Her diction and phrasing is so precise and when you hear her sing such quintessential jazz classics such as Strange Fruit, God Bless The Child, Lover Man (Oh Where Can You Be), Good Morning Heartcache and the tear-jerking, My Man, you just get goose bumps from her almost stark delivery.What Lady Sings The Blues often draws upon is racial predujice, a fact which Diana could certainly relate too as she began her career (during one of Motown's early tours around America their coach was shot at). There are some very emotionally moving scenes as Billie saw a black man hung from a tree during one of her early tours.

221085,A35XFZN4MWNKK4,6300216381,ianphillips@uk.dreamcast.com,"[16, 18]","Soul music legend Diana Ross broke down many racial barriers, opening doors for many black entertainers. Lady Sings The Blues is a prime example of her remarkable acheivements. Diana Ross wasn't, to be fair, the most ideal Billie Holiday but she was certainly perfect for this vehicle. Lady Sings The Blues is loosley drawn from Holidays autobiography of the same name though many incidents are fictionalised and re-worked for dramatic clarity. Die-hard Holiday fans were up in arms for the films often fictionalised account but they all rightly joined in to praise Diana Ross' remarkable and truly dynamic silver screen debut. Incredibly Diana had never before taken an acting lesson in her life and her only acting credit before this was a guest apperance in the U.S T.V series, Tarzan, playing a singing nun. She certainly didn't garner any such recognised praise for that role and critics doubted almost immediatley that she could truly carry out this challenging role. However once the film was released critics were silenced and astounded by Diana's masterful playing.The film follows Billie as a teenager where she worked as a prostitute in a brothel run by her mothers friend and chronicles her rise and fall of the days greatest Jazz/Blues singer. It largely focuses on her complex relationship with her husband Louis Mckay, which is played superbly by Billy Dee Williams and details her horrific, physical decline into heroin addiction. There is also a fantastic supporting turn from Richard Pryor as the Piano Man who really bites into his part and makes the most of every scene he is in. But the ultimate fact here is that Diana Ross is the star and she is just incredible. Watching her play those harrowing scenes as Billie goes through cold turkey from her heavy heroin addiction makes you appreciate her deep, raw talent. Her acting is purley instinctive and as one critic of the day accuratley pointed out that where ever the eyes of the film makers may have been, the heart of its star is in the right place! She doesn't once try and emulate Holidays vocal style, instead making the songs surprisingly her own. She completley escaped and shook off the traditional Motown sound and never does a Supreme type number. What emerges in her vocal performances on the films soundtrack are some of her strongest, most passionate work. Her diction and phrasing is so precise and when you hear her sing such quintessential jazz classics such as Strange Fruit, Lover Man (Oh Where Can You Be), Good Morning Heartache, God Bless The Child and the tear-jerking, My Man, you just get goose bumps from her almost stark delivery. What Lady Sings The Blues often draws upon is racial predujice, a fact which Diana could certainly relate to herself where she and most other Motown atists had been subjected to as they began their career's. There are some moving scenes as Billie saw a black man hung from a tree during one of her early tours. It sends shivers down the spine when she sings Strange Fruit which had been based on that horrific occurence Billie had witnessed. Diana projects the unhappy and vulnreable side to Billie which some didn't now about and plays it out with such conviction and gritty realism. The whole thing is also complimented by the thirties ambience such as the nightclubs and drug culture which are superbly and convincingly evoked. Diana certainly deserved her oscar nomination for Best Actress and its a shame she didn't win as it was such a remarkable debut but receiving the oscar nomination in the first place was an acheivement alone and she certainly deserves to be proud of her performance in this film.

221086,AQQFI7YHMRL7S,6300216381,James Morris,"[10, 25]","Billie Holiday was arguably the most important jazz singer of the 20th century.  Her musical legacy should be the primary focus of any serious attempt to film her life story, but the producers of Lady Sings the Blues have instead chosen to concentrate their efforts on a highly fictitious and overly sentimental love story.  Her third husband, Louis McKay, was but the last in a series of many abusive men in her life, yet he has been enshrined in this film as a noble and romantic figure, and falsely depicted as the main love of Billie Holiday's life.  Meanwhile, in nearly two and one half hours of screen time, there is not one single mention of the hundreds of records that Lady Day made, or the enormous influence she had on her musical peers.  Instead of a film that explores the musical genius of one of the most important artists of the 20th century, we get a trite romantic fable, with almost no basis in fact and absolutely no focus on the innovative music that was the essence of Miss Holiday's legacy.  Billie Holiday's music WAS her life; her relationship with Louis McKay was singularly unimportant in her story yet looms disproportionately large in this movie.  In short, this film bears no resemblance to Billie Holiday's life, nor does it offer any substantive information on what her music was about.  While it's true that many critics singled out the acting debut of Diana Ross as impressive, her performance is not nearly enough to compensate for the factual, musical and dramatic deficiencies of this film.",1,Should Have Focused on the Music,1133395200,"12 1, 2005",2005,1528,"['Billie', 'Holiday', 'was', 'arguably', 'most', 'important', 'jazz', 'singer', '20th', 'century', 'musical', 'legacy', 'should', 'be', 'primary', 'focus', 'serious', 'attempt', 'film', 'life', 'story', 'producers', 'Lady', 'Sings', 'Blues', 'have', 'instead', 'chosen', 'concentrate', 'efforts', 'highly', 'fictitious', 'overly', 'sentimental', 'love', 'story', 'third', 'husband', 'Louis', 'McKay', 'was', 'last', 'series', 'many', 'abusive', 'men', 'life', 'yet', 'been', 'enshrined', 'film', 'noble', 'romantic', 'figure', 'falsely', 'depicted', 'main', 'love', 'Billie', 'Holiday', 'life', 'Meanwhile', 'nearly', 'two', 'one', 'half', 'hours', 'screen', 'time', 'not', 'one', 'single', 'mention', 'hundreds', 'records', 'Lady', 'Day', 'made', 'enormous', 'influence', 'had', 'musical', 'peers', 'Instead', 'film', 'musical', 'genius', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'artists', '20th', 'century', 'get', 'trite', 'romantic', 'fable', 'almost', 'basis', 'fact', 'absolutely', 'focus', 'innovative', 'music', 'was', 'essence', 'Miss', 'Holiday', 'legacy', 'Billie', 'Holiday', 'music', 'WAS', 'life', 'relationship', 'Louis', 'McKay', 'was', 'singularly', 'unimportant', 'story', 'yet', 'disproportionately', 'large', 'movie', 'short', 'film', 'resemblance', 'Billie', 'Holiday', 'life', 'offer', 'substantive', 'information', 'what', 'music', 'was', 'about', 'true', 'many', 'critics', 'singled', 'out', 'acting', 'debut', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'impressive', 'performance', 'not', 'nearly', 'enough', 'compensate', 'factual', 'musical', 'dramatic', 'deficiencies', 'film']",N/A

She starts out the first 20 or so minutes of the film playing a ""girl ALMOST 14""! Ridiculous. Diana is laughable as a twenty-something woman talking girl talk, wearing pigtails, using what she thinks are child-like mannerisms and working in a whore house! The movie is loosely based on Billie Hoiday's autobiography which is loosely based on reality. Many, many things Billie claims happen just didn't. In essence, she lied. There are dozens and dozens of silly things about this movie that I will point out just a few: Billie NEVER saw a lynching as they show in the film. She did sing a song ""Strange Fruit"" about lynching but the movie would have you think she had something to do with writing the song after this event. She didn't. The song was written by a Jewish school teacher years earlier based on a picture in a book of a lynching. Billie just came across it and sang it. Next: she never ran into the KKK in her life and she certainly didn't scream and yell at the klansmen like they show her doing in this movie, drawing attention to herself and putting her life and her friends' lives all in danger. Never happened. She was a great singer but she was a junkie who lost her voice and died with $750.00 strapped to her leg, all she had left.Diana screams, cries, goes hysterical, pouts, tries to play a junkie in this campy black ""Valley of the Dolls"" and is horrible. Diana has a tiny, whiny voice that is in no way like Billie's.To make matters worse, she repeats the same mistake a few years later in ""The Wiz"", an otherwise good film she sinks by again playing a part written for a young girl and whining, crying, screaming and rarely smiling throughout (there are 3 songs where she cracks a smile unconvincingly). The woman just cannot act. Her voice is so slight she has no reason to be in a musical.Instead of paying tribute to Billie she ends up slapping her in the face with a cheesy Lifetime movie interpretation of a truly great American artist.The direction of ""Lady Sings the Blues"" is by-the-numbers.

Though the film is not historically accurate about her life and her relationship with Louis McKay (played by Billie Dee Williams), it is effective in demonstrating the traumas of her early life, the color bar which prevented her from singing in many whites-only venues, her drug and alcohol addictions (which eventually led to her death at age forty-four of liver and heart disease), and the events which led to many of her most famous songs.Diana Ross, as Billie, is passionate and driven, and her portrayal of Billie in the midst of drug withdrawal is heart-rending and effective.  Playing the role ""full out,"" Ross deals with the script she has been given, and she richly deserves her Golden Globe Award for Most Promising Female Newcomer in this screen debut.  A consortium of scriptwriters, which drew on the frank, but partly fictionalized, autobiography Billie wrote with William Dufty in 1956, has omitted or changed many aspects of her life in order to make the film more unified and dramatic, creating a film that creates even more myths about Billie.Billy Dee Williams is terrific as Louis McKay, appearing slick and smooth at the beginning, but showing subtle changes of feeling as he is drawn into Billie's orbit and provides some stability for her.  The accompanist (Richard Pryor) seems genuinely to care for her, as, it seems, does Reg Hanley (James T. Callahan), though the reasons Harry Bradford (Paul Hampton) has for getting her hooked on drugs is not clear.  Ross is surprisingly good when she sings Billie's songs, copying her phrasing and creating a sound that somewhat resembles hers, though Billie's gutsy heart is missing.Nominated for Best Actress (Diana Ross), Set Decoration and Art Direction, Costumes (Bob Mackie), Best Music/Scoring, and Best Story and Screenplay, this is a dramatic and showy film about a singing legend's tragic life, but it is more entertainment than  biography, especially in its emphasis on the Reg Hanley band.  Though one would not know this from the film, Teddy Wilson, Benny Goodman, Duke Ellington, and Count Basie also played important roles in Billie's career.

221097,A2R6RA8FRBS608,6300216381,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[4, 5]","Lady Sings The Blues tells the life story of Billie Holiday, one of the greatest jazz singers of all time. Billie is portrayed so ably by Diana Ross; and Billy Dee Williams also stars as Louis McKay, the man who (at least in the movie) loves Billie unconditionally. The very convincing acting makes up for a plot that moves along nicely but then starts to move too fast through the last twenty years of Billie Holiday's life.We see Billie Holiday (Diana Ross) begin her life by being a prostitute and washer woman courtesy of the school of hard knocks. Billie's mother (Virginia Capers) turns in a great performance as a geographically distant mother who loves her daughter Billie and eventually they spend more time together after Billie moves to New York. Billie shows her persistence and finally gets her first job singing in a club/brothel where the clients learn to like a woman who respects herself enough to not be a dancing prostitute for the crowd.Enter Louis McKay (Billy Dee Williams), portrayed in this movie as the love of Billie's life. He remains true to Billie while she does a breakneck cross country tour that eventually leaves her paying a hefty price in her personal life. Louis again stays true to Billie through the ups and downs of her career; and these career ups and downs also take quite a toll on Billie's health as they influence the lives of those around her. ""Piano Man,"" played by Richard Pryor, eventually pays a terrible price for ""helping"" Billie when his plans to ""help"" her go awry.The movie goes into depth about Billie's general quality of life and her milestones--up to 1936, that is, when the plot starts moving at breakneck speed after taking a long but very thorough road to the middle point of Billie's all too short life. Specifically, the movie takes 90 minutes to get to 1936 when Billie was roughly 21 years old; and the remaining 23 years of Billie's life are covered in a superficial 28 minutes. The plot moves so fast that it covers the last three years of Billie's life in about a minute simply by showing truncated headlines of newspaper articles that point to nothing but tragedy and endless misery. Worse yet, Billie's relationship with her common-law husband Joe Guy (1951-1957) is ignored by the plot; and Louis McKay is featured as the only man in Billie's life even though they were separated at the time of her passing. According to The Internet Movie Database, Billie was also married to Jimmy Monroe but this is also absent from the plot. The flawless performances by the actors in the movie tempt me to give the movie five stars; but I have to put my personal feelings aside and give it three and one half stars for the very noticeable inaccuracies in the story of Billie's life.The DVD extras include commentary by director Sidney Furie, producer Berry Gordy and Motown manager Shelly Berger. You get some deleted scenes but the image quality of the deleted scenes leaves something to be desired. You also get is a 23 minute featurette about the making of Lady Sings The Blues. The choreography reflects a lot of hard work and thought during crowded scenes including the numerous nightclub scenes and the K** rally during the bus tour that Billie takes in her early years with an all white band. The cinematography really impresses me with scenes that have Billie and Piano Man on the California beach. The lighting also enhances the cinematography; every scene appears to have been carefully crafted to produce just the right effect.Overall, Lady Sings The Blues gives us a relatively good but not perfect biopic of the life and times of the late, immortal jazz singer Billie Holiday. We get the story of a woman's life sensitively told through words and music. The performances help to minimize the plot problems: Diana Ross turns in a wonderful performance as Billie Holiday. Billy Dee Williams shines as her lover and husband Louis McKay; and Richard Pryor acts very ably as Piano Man.",4,"The Portrait Of A Lady--sensitive, well acted and engaging",1183680000,"07 6, 2007",2007,3952,"['Lady', 'Blues', 'life', 'story', 'Billie', 'Holiday', 'one', 'greatest', 'jazz', 'singers', 'time', 'Billie', 'portrayed', 'so', 'ably', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'Billy', 'Dee', 'Williams', 'also', 'Louis', 'McKay', 'man', 'who', 'least', 'movie', 'Billie', 'unconditionally', 'very', 'convincing', 'acting', 'up', 'plot', 'along', 'nicely', 'then', 'move', 'too', 'fast', 'last', 'twenty', 'years', 'Billie', 'Holiday', 'life.We', 'see', 'Billie', 'Holiday', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'begin', 'life', 'being', 'prostitute', 'washer', 'woman', 'courtesy', 'school', 'hard', 'knocks', 'Billie', 'mother', 'Virginia', 'Capers', 'great', 'performance', 'geographically', 'distant', 'mother', 'who', 'daughter', 'Billie', 'eventually', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'together', 'Billie', 'New', 'York', 'Billie', 'persistence', 'finally', 'first', 'job', 'singing', 'club/brothel', 'where', 'clients', 'learn', 'like', 'woman', 'who', 'enough', 'not', 'be', 'dancing', 'prostitute', 'crowd.Enter', 'Louis', 'McKay', 'Billy', 'Dee', 'Williams', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'love', 'Billie', 'life', 'true', 'Billie', 'breakneck', 'cross', 'country', 'tour', 'eventually', 'paying', 'hefty', 'price', 'personal', 'life', 'Louis', 'again', 'true', 'Billie', 'ups', 'downs', 'career', 'career', 'ups', 'downs', 'also', 'take', 'quite', 'toll', 'Billie', 'health', 'influence', 'lives', 'Piano', 'Man', 'played', 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'eventually', 'terrible', 'price', 'helping', 'Billie', 'when', 'plans', 'help', 'go', 'awry.The', 'movie', 'depth', 'Billie', 'general', 'quality', 'life', 'milestones', 'up', '1936', 'when', 'plot', 'moving', 'breakneck', 'speed', 'taking', 'long', 'very', 'thorough', 'road', 'middle', 'point', 'Billie', 'too', 'short', 'life', 'Specifically', 'movie', '90', 'minutes', 'get', '1936', 'when', 'Billie', 'was', 'roughly', '21', 'years', 'old', 'remaining', '23', 'years', 'Billie', 'life', 'are', 'covered', 'superficial', '28', 'minutes', 'plot', 'so', 'fast', 'last', 'three', 'years', 'Billie', 'life', 'minute', 'simply', 'showing', 'truncated', 'headlines', 'newspaper', 'articles', 'point', 'nothing', 'tragedy', 'endless', 'misery', 'Worse', 'yet', 'Billie', 'relationship', 'common-law', 'husband', 'Joe', 'Guy', '1951-1957', 'ignored', 'plot', 'Louis', 'McKay', 'featured', 'only', 'man', 'Billie', 'life', 'even', 'were', 'separated', 'time', 'passing', 'According', 'Internet', 'Movie', 'Database', 'Billie', 'was', 'also', 'married', 'Jimmy', 'Monroe', 'also', 'absent', 'plot', 'flawless', 'performances', 'actors', 'movie', 'tempt', 'give', 'movie', 'five', 'stars', 'have', 'put', 'personal', 'feelings', 'aside', 'give', 'three', 'one', 'half', 'stars', 'very', 'noticeable', 'inaccuracies', 'story', 'Billie', 'life.The', 'DVD', 'extras', 'include', 'commentary', 'director', 'Sidney', 'Furie', 'producer', 'Berry', 'Gordy', 'Motown', 'manager', 'Shelly', 'Berger', 'get', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'image', 'quality', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'also', 'get', '23', 'minute', 'featurette', 'making', 'Lady', 'Sings', 'Blues', 'choreography', 'lot', 'hard', 'work', 'thought', 'crowded', 'scenes', 'including', 'numerous', 'nightclub', 'scenes', 'K**', 'rally', 'bus', 'tour', 'Billie', 'early', 'years', 'white', 'band', 'cinematography', 'really', 'scenes', 'have', 'Billie', 'Piano', 'Man', 'California', 'beach', 'lighting', 'also', 'cinematography', 'scene', 'have', 'been', 'carefully', 'crafted', 'produce', 'just', 'right', 'effect.Overall', 'Lady', 'Sings', 'Blues', 'relatively', 'good', 'not', 'perfect', 'biopic', 'life', 'times', 'late', 'immortal', 'jazz', 'singer', 'Billie', 'Holiday', 'get', 'story', 'woman', 'life', 'sensitively', 'told', 'words', 'music', 'performances', 'help', 'minimize', 'plot', 'problems', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'Billie', 'Holiday', 'Billy', 'Dee', 'Williams', 'shines', 'lover', 'husband', 'Louis', 'McKay', 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'very', 'ably', 'Piano', 'Man']",N/A

I know to many Diana Ross fans, even suggesting the immortal diva is nothing but a gift from heaven is unthinkable sacrilege. But to those of us who are less than sheep, let's look at the film's so-called ""strong"" points, one by one:First: Ross neither looked or sounded like Billie. Not even close. This isn't opinion, it's fact. She didn't even try to mimic her physical style. Kinda hard to do a musical biopic when that sort of disparity exists. You'd be far better off buying a real Billie CD and reading Lady Sings The Blues - the book. And the argument, ""But she put her own spin on Billie"" doesn't wash. That's like Green Day doing an album of Stones songs. Neither belongs in a movie about the performer.Second: Gordy and many others had never made a film or even been involved in a movie before, and it shows. Not in a good way, either. There are a lot of amateurish touches here that are very easy to spot.Third, if you're gonna make even a half-baked bipopic of someone, shouldn't the really pertinent facts about their lives be present and/or intact? FAR from the case here.Fourth, and most important, Ross was a good (solo) to great (Supremes) singer, but she was WAY out of her depth here. The fact is, she's a horrible actress, and that's what sinks this movie (let's not even discuss Mahogany or Wiz). Again, if you want to be honest, this is not conjecture, but fact. I'm sorry; rolling around on mats doesn't constitute good acting. Neither does opening your eyes wide and screaming - ""insane look #247a"" from the would-be actors' handbook. It'd have been interesting to see what someone like Cicely Tyson or Ruby Dee could've done with this... even Leslie Uggams, who has definitely had her moments of surprisingly good acting. In fact, the only really decent acting in the whole film, which is why I gave it two stars, was Richard Pryor, who really excelled, even though his role was largely fictitious.Fifth, the Oscar nominations don't mean diddly; lots of bad acting and films have been nominated and even won Oscars over the years. Need I say more than John Wayne in True Grit or Halle Berry?Sixth, the wonderful reviews the film got when it first came out weren't all that numerous.Check for yourself. And I'm sure Gordy bought some, too; remember, he had all kinds of juice back then.Seventh, the argument that the film brought Billie Holiday out of obscurity to the masses is total garbage.

There was little hint of the depth of her dramatic ability.So, why 4 stars instead of 5? Though Diana Ross is great, there are some scenes that drag, as they only rehash what we already know.

Upon the film's release, there was much criticism of the casting of Ross, due to her waiflike size and voice that didn't come close to matching the power of Holiday.  However, Ross does an admirable job, as she states in the accompanying featurette, in portraying ""Lady Day"" as best that Ross could do.Another plus of the film is its presentation of the romance between Ross's Holiday and Billy Dee Williams's ""Louis McKay.""  There have been few films, before and after, that have shown African-Americans as strong, romantic figures and in that arena, LSTB soars.  It is a shame that thirty-three years have passed with only a smattering of films featuring African-American principals shown in a loving relationship.Also, the cinematography and lighting are superb.  The different hues of the black, as well as white, actors are shown at their singular differences.Michel Legrand's score, though dated in spots, is effective as it dramatizes the various events in Holiday's life.  Ross does well in her interpretations of Billie's trademark songs.Though the film isn't quite up to par with later similarly themed musical biopics (""Ray"" and the current theatrical ""Walk the Line""), it is still a fine representation of expert storytelling, fine performances, and attention to detail.Bravo to Berry Gordy for producing this landmark film.",4,"Entertaining, if not biographically accurate!",1134259200,"12 11, 2005",2005,1639,"['Other', 'biopics', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'mark', 'accurate', 'depiction', 'celebrities', 'profiled', 'Lady', 'Blues', 'engaging', 'story', 'featuring', 'Oscar-worthy', 'performance', 'first-time', 'actress', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'supporting', 'player', 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'also', 'doing', 'noteworthy', 'job', 'acting', 'film', 'release', 'was', 'much', 'criticism', 'casting', 'Ross', 'due', 'waiflike', 'size', 'voice', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'close', 'matching', 'power', 'Holiday', 'However', 'Ross', 'admirable', 'job', 'accompanying', 'featurette', 'portraying', 'Lady', 'Day', 'best', 'Ross', 'could', 'do.Another', 'film', 'presentation', 'romance', 'Ross', 'Holiday', 'Billy', 'Dee', 'Williams', 'Louis', 'McKay', 'have', 'been', 'few', 'films', 'have', 'shown', 'African-Americans', 'strong', 'romantic', 'figures', 'arena', 'LSTB', 'shame', 'thirty-three', 'years', 'have', 'passed', 'only', 'smattering', 'films', 'featuring', 'African-American', 'principals', 'shown', 'loving', 'relationship.Also', 'cinematography', 'lighting', 'are', 'superb', 'different', 'hues', 'black', 'as', 'well', 'white', 'actors', 'are', 'shown', 'singular', 'differences.Michel', 'Legrand', 'score', 'though', 'dated', 'spots', 'effective', 'various', 'events', 'Holiday', 'life', 'Ross', 'well', 'interpretations', 'Billie', 'trademark', 'film', ""n't"", 'quite', 'up', 'par', 'later', 'similarly', 'themed', 'musical', 'biopics', 'Ray', 'current', 'theatrical', 'Walk', 'Line', 'still', 'fine', 'representation', 'expert', 'storytelling', 'fine', 'performances', 'attention', 'detail.Bravo', 'Berry', 'Gordy', 'producing', 'landmark', 'film']",N/A

She lost to Liza Minnilli for ""Cabaret"".Diana plays Blues singer Billie Holliday. As most ardent Holliday fans know Billie was a severe drug addict. Her drug addiction is what destroyed her and Diana Ross should be applauded for her mesmerizing performance of a woman who eventually had everything in the world then threw it all away to drugs. The most dramatic scenes are the ones in which Billie argues with her boyfriend, played beautifully by Billy Dee Willimas, when he insists she stop using heroine. Billie runs into the bathroom, slams the door, and injects heroine into her veins. The withdrawal scenes are exceptionally well acted and directed. This film was one of the first to dramatize drug use.The music of Billie Holiday is well documented in this film and Diana does a superb job in recapturing the esssence of one of America's finest Blues singers.The DVD comes with commentary by Barry Gordy who produced the film, director Sidney Furie, and artist manager Shelly Berger.

Then go play Billie Holiday's. It's eerie. Ross didn't try to imitate Holiday, that would have been shameful, what she DID was study Holiday and captured that elusive Billie-phrasing and timing. Components that separated Holiday from Fitzgerald, Washington, Vaughn or Clooney and Day. And anyone doubting her acting capabilities, should watch that padded cell scene, which opens the film.
