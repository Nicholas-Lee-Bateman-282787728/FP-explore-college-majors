Well tonight I finally got a chance to see this heart warming movie on DVD. I am a huge fan of Keaton as well. His performance here is unique and vast. She will always amaze me in her acting if it is from movies like Crimes of the Heart to The First Wives Club, Father of the Bride, even Baby boom. She will forever be an amazing talent woman, of acting in my book. I saw Lewis for the first time in The Evening Star yet another fine film that is a sequel Terms of Endearment. This move is well directed and well paced as well. I was about give up on it about 45 min into the move talking about the story line. But I was so trapped with Keaton's performance that I gave it a chance. I am glad I did. The story came around in more ways than one. It is a beautiful love story about two special people that fall in love and are given a hard time form people around them (e.g. Keaton the mother). Her role as a mother of three daughters tends to be over protecting. She wants to run their lives as she sees fit, not to what makes them happy. It is a test of emotional fitness between Keaton and Lewis (mother and daughter) that makes it worth seeing. The performance of Ribisi presented here is amazing too. The chemistry between Lewis and Ribisi are very special that keeps the warmth in this movie alive. The Other Sister will warm your heart, make you laugh and bring tears of joy to your eyes.

With every viewing the tenderness and good qualities just improve.  Though the film industry is dealing more often with the mentally challenged these days (I AM SAM, RADIO, etc) few can equal the tender love story that is created by Juliet Lewis and Giovanni Ribisi.

But it is the overwhelmingly fine performances by Lewis and Ribisi that are of the quality of commitment that seeing them on repeated viewings just fortifies the brilliance of their acting.

466438,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,6305492042,Gregor von Kallahann,"[4, 6]","The acting carries the day in this one.  Juliette Lewis is fascinating to watch as a mentally challenged young woman trying to establish her independence from her wealthy family (especially her overly protective mother, well played by Diane Keaton).  Tom Skerritt turns in a fine performance as the young woman's equally concerned but ultimately more supportive dad.  Throw in a touching performance by Giovanni Ribisi as a similarly mentally challenged suitor, and you've got the 'feel good' movie of whatever year it is that you happen to see it in.Many critics have found the film's portrayal of the mentally challenged a bit condescending.  There may be some validity to that criticism--after all, these two young people are really quite articulate given their condition.  But that's the point here.  These are high functioning individuals who can reach full potential given half a chance.  More challenged individuals may never reach this level of independence and may never be able to accept full responsibility for their lives (e.g. or to marry as two leads in this film do).  But many can and they deserve the right to pursue thier happiness in their way and to the best of their abilities.So the film's message is a good one and the acting is solid throughout.  Diane Keaton as the conflicted mom is particularly impressive.  She is not just a shrew.  She is a concerned and loving parent who has a lot of baggage of her own to overcome.  (She is also troubled by another daughter's lesbian relationship, and ultimately overcomes some of her prejudices on that score as well.)  Why doesn't the film achieve something like greatness?  The answers are many and varied.While it's true that the movie is sweet, and not overly sentimental, it's just sentimental enough to bring it down a couple of notches (or a couple of stars) in my estimation.  We know that everything is going to work out just fine in the end.  Juliette Lewis' Carla just radiates resiliency, and the spirit is contagious enough to bring out the best in all around her.  So there's a predictablility problem there.  And what isn't predictable is often just too heavy handed.  Ribisi's drunken public profession of love (and admission of ""doing it"") at a country club celebration--followed by his interruption of Carla's sister's wedding, to effectively do the same, is all just a little too much.There are even more fundamental problems. The film's choppy editing makes for poor pacing too.  The subplots aren't given nearly enough time to develop.  The gay sister's life and the complications that brings to the family deserved more attention.  As a plot device, it's just one more thing the family has to deal with and one more prejudice the mother, in particular, has to overcome.  We also learn, in the context of one of the parents many arguments, that the hubby once had a drinking problem.  But after that one mention, that potentially interesting subplot gets dropped too.And does it make any sense that Carla was apparently tucked away in a special school a few hundred miles away from the family's San Francisco home, and went for years without much visititation from her family members, only to be fully integrated into the family once again upon her completion of that program?  If that were the case, there would likely be a lot more anger on Carla's part than there seems to be.  Is she basically so sweet natured that that neglect is something she can ignore.  Hard to believe that any child would accept that.Ultimately, the acting becomes the film's saving grace.  Juliette Lewis did not receive an Oscar nomination for her role in this film--strange considering the Acacemy's prediliction for films about the handicapped.  Maybe it's because of the Academy's relative bias against younger actors. Or maybe it's because it was a Garry Marshall comedy, not a Jim Sheridan drama.  Whatever the case, this admittedly flawed film is still worth watching--for Juliette Lewis, Giovanni Ribisi and just about everyone else in the cast.  Well worth checking out..",3,"Great Cast, Flawed Movie",1119139200,"06 19, 2005",2005,4047,"['acting', 'day', 'one', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'young', 'woman', 'trying', 'establish', 'independence', 'wealthy', 'family', 'especially', 'overly', 'protective', 'mother', 'well', 'played', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'Tom', 'Skerritt', 'fine', 'performance', 'young', 'woman', 'equally', 'concerned', 'ultimately', 'more', 'supportive', 'dad', 'Throw', 'touching', 'performance', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'similarly', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'suitor', ""'ve"", 'got', ""'feel"", 'good', 'movie', 'year', 'happen', 'see', 'in.Many', 'critics', 'have', 'found', 'film', 'portrayal', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'bit', 'condescending', 'may', 'be', 'validity', 'criticism', 'two', 'young', 'people', 'are', 'really', 'quite', 'articulate', 'given', 'condition', 'point', 'here', 'are', 'high', 'functioning', 'individuals', 'who', 'can', 'reach', 'full', 'potential', 'given', 'chance', 'More', 'challenged', 'individuals', 'may', 'never', 'reach', 'level', 'independence', 'may', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'accept', 'full', 'responsibility', 'lives', 'e.g', 'marry', 'two', 'leads', 'film', 'do', 'many', 'can', 'deserve', 'right', 'pursue', 'thier', 'happiness', 'way', 'best', 'abilities.So', 'film', 'message', 'good', 'one', 'acting', 'solid', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'conflicted', 'mom', 'particularly', 'impressive', 'not', 'just', 'shrew', 'concerned', 'loving', 'parent', 'who', 'lot', 'baggage', 'own', 'overcome', 'also', 'troubled', 'daughter', 'lesbian', 'relationship', 'ultimately', 'prejudices', 'score', 'as', 'well', 'Why', ""n't"", 'film', 'achieve', 'something', 'greatness', 'answers', 'are', 'many', 'true', 'movie', 'sweet', 'not', 'overly', 'sentimental', 'just', 'sentimental', 'enough', 'bring', 'down', 'couple', 'notches', 'couple', 'stars', 'estimation', 'know', 'everything', 'going', 'work', 'out', 'just', 'fine', 'end', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'Carla', 'just', 'resiliency', 'spirit', 'contagious', 'enough', 'bring', 'out', 'best', 'predictablility', 'problem', 'there', 'what', ""n't"", 'predictable', 'often', 'just', 'too', 'heavy', 'handed', 'Ribisi', 'drunken', 'public', 'profession', 'love', 'admission', 'doing', 'country', 'club', 'celebration', 'followed', 'interruption', 'Carla', 'sister', 'wedding', 'effectively', 'do', 'same', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'fundamental', 'problems', 'film', 'choppy', 'editing', 'poor', 'pacing', 'too', 'subplots', 'are', ""n't"", 'given', 'nearly', 'enough', 'time', 'develop', 'gay', 'sister', 'life', 'complications', 'family', 'deserved', 'more', 'attention', 'plot', 'device', 'just', 'one', 'more', 'thing', 'family', 'deal', 'one', 'more', 'prejudice', 'mother', 'particular', 'overcome', 'also', 'learn', 'context', 'one', 'parents', 'many', 'arguments', 'hubby', 'once', 'had', 'drinking', 'problem', 'one', 'mention', 'potentially', 'interesting', 'subplot', 'dropped', 'too.And', 'make', 'sense', 'Carla', 'was', 'apparently', 'tucked', 'away', 'special', 'school', 'few', 'hundred', 'miles', 'away', 'family', 'San', 'Francisco', 'home', 'went', 'years', 'much', 'visititation', 'family', 'members', 'only', 'be', 'fully', 'integrated', 'family', 'once', 'again', 'completion', 'program', 'were', 'case', 'would', 'likely', 'be', 'lot', 'more', 'anger', 'Carla', 'part', 'there', 'be', 'basically', 'so', 'sweet', 'natured', 'neglect', 'something', 'can', 'ignore', 'Hard', 'believe', 'child', 'would', 'accept', 'that.Ultimately', 'acting', 'film', 'saving', 'grace', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'did', 'not', 'receive', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'role', 'film', 'strange', 'considering', 'Acacemy', 'prediliction', 'films', 'handicapped', 'Maybe', 'Academy', 'relative', 'bias', 'younger', 'actors', 'was', 'Garry', 'Marshall', 'comedy', 'not', 'Jim', 'Sheridan', 'drama', 'case', 'admittedly', 'flawed', 'film', 'still', 'worth', 'watching', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'just', 'everyone', 'else', 'cast', 'Well', 'checking', 'out..']",The Other Sister VHS
466439,A3ML2HRDE3PY5I,6305492042,Hikari,"[4, 9]","One can't help feeling like a heel for dissing, however slightly, a story about sweet and gutsy mentally challenged people.  However, I came away from &quot;The Other Sister&quot; with the vague feeling the Garry  Marshall, however unintentionally, has exploited the very subjects he means  to elevate, all in the name of popular entertainment.  I applaud the  standout leads, Juliette Lewis and Giovanni Ribisi, who both give  convincing and humanizing performances as Carla and Danny, a pair of  mentally-challenged young people who fall in love.  The bubbly soundtrack  and lovely exterior shots of San Francisco complement the story well.  However, it seems that Marshall is uncertain whether he is making a  uplifting romantic comedy or a treatise on family dysfunction in the 90s.  The movie veers uncomfortably between these two extremes, sometimes with  jarring results.  Because of the subject matter, Marshall seems to feel  that he must present a socially &quot;significant&quot; piece, and throws  in enough family trauma to fuel an entire season of both &quot;Jenny  Jones&quot; AND &quot;Montell&quot;.  I don't deny that a disabled child is  a source of great strain on a family, but the characters Marshall presents  us with are little more than a set of cardboard, ultimately insulting  stereotypes.  Diane Keaton, teetering on the edge of self-parody, plays  Carla's overbearing and high-strung socialite mother, a clothes horse who  cannot come to terms with the fact that her youngest daughter will never be  Deb of the Year.  Tom Skerritt is more sympathetic as Carla's loving but  ineffectual father, a recovering alcoholic who is wracked by guilt over his  daughter and his inability to stand up to his domineering wife.  Throw in  two spoiled and self-involved &quot;normal&quot; sisters, one of whom  further overloads the already over-burdened storyline by insisting that her  family accept her lesbian companion, the disintigrating marriage of Carla's  parents, and Danny's burgeoning alcohol problem and own family troubles,  and you have one colossal stewpot of pain and misery.The film really  shines in its lighter moments. When Carla gets a disasterous makeover at  the mall, or when she and Danny discuss initiating a sexual relationship,  Marshall displays the light touch that made &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; such a  hit.  But too much of &quot;The Other Sister&quot; feels like a failed  attempt at family therapy.  Imagine if Marshall had let us see the dark  side of his hooker heroine Vivian Ward's life in &quot;Pretty  Woman&quot;--beatings by her pimp, nights in the county lockup, visits to  the STD clinic and so on.  You get the idea.  Somewhere in this unfocused  heap of pain, &quot;Other Sister&quot; houses a comedy gem.  It's just  really hard to find.  I'm not suggesting that the plight of people like  Carla and Danny is laughable, far from it.  Just that Marshall tries to  show us too much, and would have done better to err on the side of humor.  All too often, I felt I was watching a glorified TV Movie of the Week,  albeit with outstanding production values.  By the time Carla has her dream  wedding at the end, we are past caring, since it all rings so false and  overwrought.  However, Lewis and Ribisi keep you watching.  Despite all the  Sturm and Drang going on around them, Carla and Danny transcend their  handicaps, and come off as more grounded than the so-called  &quot;normal&quot; people in their lives.  Look for Marshall favorite  Hector Elizondo in a small role as a musician that befriends the beleagered  couple.&quot;The Other Sister&quot; is a pleasant enough video  evening.  Pop plenty of popcorn, so the crunching will distract you from  the story's many implausibilities.  Whether you are expecting a  light-hearted romantic comedy, or a serious topical film on mental  retardation, you will be vaguely disappointed, but it's worth one go round.",2,Sweet but ultimately unsatisfying love story,950054400,"02 9, 2000",2000,3926,"['One', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feeling', 'heel', 'dissing', 'however', 'slightly', 'story', 'sweet', 'gutsy', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'people', 'However', 'came', 'away', 'quot', 'Other', 'Sister', 'quot', 'vague', 'feeling', 'Garry', 'Marshall', 'however', 'unintentionally', 'exploited', 'very', 'elevate', 'name', 'popular', 'entertainment', 'applaud', 'standout', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'who', 'give', 'convincing', 'humanizing', 'performances', 'Carla', 'Danny', 'pair', 'mentally-challenged', 'young', 'people', 'who', 'fall', 'love', 'bubbly', 'soundtrack', 'lovely', 'exterior', 'shots', 'San', 'Francisco', 'complement', 'story', 'well', 'However', 'Marshall', 'uncertain', 'making', 'uplifting', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'treatise', 'family', 'dysfunction', '90s', 'movie', 'veers', 'uncomfortably', 'two', 'extremes', 'sometimes', 'jarring', 'results', 'subject', 'matter', 'Marshall', 'feel', 'must', 'present', 'socially', 'quot', 'significant', 'quot', 'piece', 'enough', 'family', 'trauma', 'fuel', 'entire', 'season', 'quot', 'Jenny', 'Jones', 'quot', 'AND', 'quot', 'Montell', 'quot', 'do', ""n't"", 'deny', 'disabled', 'child', 'source', 'great', 'strain', 'family', 'characters', 'Marshall', 'are', 'little', 'more', 'set', 'cardboard', 'ultimately', 'insulting', 'stereotypes', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'teetering', 'edge', 'self-parody', 'Carla', 'overbearing', 'high-strung', 'socialite', 'mother', 'clothes', 'horse', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'come', 'terms', 'fact', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'Deb', 'Year', 'Tom', 'Skerritt', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'Carla', 'loving', 'ineffectual', 'father', 'recovering', 'alcoholic', 'who', 'wracked', 'guilt', 'daughter', 'inability', 'stand', 'up', 'domineering', 'wife', 'Throw', 'two', 'spoiled', 'self-involved', 'quot', 'normal', 'quot', 'sisters', 'one', 'whom', 'further', 'already', 'over-burdened', 'storyline', 'insisting', 'family', 'lesbian', 'companion', 'disintigrating', 'marriage', 'Carla', 'parents', 'Danny', 'burgeoning', 'alcohol', 'problem', 'own', 'family', 'troubles', 'have', 'one', 'colossal', 'stewpot', 'pain', 'misery.The', 'film', 'really', 'lighter', 'moments', 'When', 'Carla', 'disasterous', 'makeover', 'mall', 'when', 'Danny', 'discuss', 'initiating', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'Marshall', 'light', 'touch', 'made', 'quot', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'quot', 'hit', 'too', 'much', 'quot', 'Other', 'Sister', 'quot', 'feels', 'failed', 'attempt', 'family', 'therapy', 'Imagine', 'Marshall', 'had', 'let', 'see', 'dark', 'side', 'hooker', 'heroine', 'Vivian', 'Ward', 'life', 'quot', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'quot', 'beatings', 'pimp', 'nights', 'county', 'lockup', 'visits', 'STD', 'clinic', 'so', 'get', 'idea', 'Somewhere', 'unfocused', 'heap', 'pain', 'quot', 'Other', 'Sister', 'quot', 'houses', 'comedy', 'gem', 'just', 'really', 'hard', 'find', ""'m"", 'not', 'suggesting', 'plight', 'people', 'Carla', 'Danny', 'laughable', 'far', 'Just', 'Marshall', 'show', 'too', 'much', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'err', 'side', 'humor', 'too', 'often', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'glorified', 'TV', 'Movie', 'Week', 'outstanding', 'production', 'values', 'time', 'Carla', 'dream', 'wedding', 'end', 'are', 'past', 'caring', 'rings', 'so', 'false', 'overwrought', 'However', 'Lewis', 'Ribisi', 'keep', 'watching', 'Sturm', 'Drang', 'going', 'Carla', 'Danny', 'transcend', 'handicaps', 'come', 'off', 'more', 'grounded', 'so-called', 'quot', 'normal', 'quot', 'people', 'lives', 'Look', 'Marshall', 'favorite', 'Hector', 'Elizondo', 'small', 'role', 'musician', 'beleagered', 'couple.', 'quot', 'Other', 'Sister', 'quot', 'pleasant', 'enough', 'video', 'evening', 'Pop', 'plenty', 'popcorn', 'crunching', 'will', 'distract', 'story', 'many', 'implausibilities', 'are', 'expecting', 'light-hearted', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'serious', 'topical', 'film', 'mental', 'retardation', 'will', 'be', 'vaguely', 'disappointed', 'worth', 'one', 'go', 'round']",The Other Sister VHS

This film was hard to watch.  Intellectual Disability isn't a set of behaviours, its a set of perceptions, a way of processing information.  When a non-disabled actor steps into such a role, they have to really get to grips with this or the disability they are portraying seems 'clad' onto them, unconvincing, inconsistent and to those who have these disabilities and their families, the performance can seem patronising.  Whilst The Other Sister set out with great intentions, to draw attention to the equal need for relationship and sexuality of a person with an intellectual disability, the performance itself was a let down.  Hoffman in Rain Man did a remarkable job.  Penn in I Am Sam did a great acting job but the focus of the film seemed more on disability than the person with it.

Obviously she was supposed to be annoying, but I think she overacted a bit and she needed better lines, she seemed to say the same stuff over and over again. Another reason I didn't love this film was because Hollywood once again tried to push us into accepting homosexuality as normal and good.

Lewis and Ribisi do excellent jobs with their parts, making their characters sympathetic and realistic, never veering off into quirky for the sake of quirk or into stereotyping.  You laugh a lot during the film and cry more than once and feel like you've experienced something worthwhile when the credits finally role. If there's anything that keeps me from giving it five stars, it's more due to the directing and the script which tend to be a little sappy, a little heavy handed at times, and sometimes you feel like the characters speak not so much what and how they would, but what the screenwriter is thinking, things that could be gotten across with less words and more indirectly, subtly.

466476,A96K1ZGW56S2I,6305492042,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[4, 5]","Juliette Lewis stars in this movie about a very wealthy (don't forget that, it's important to the story) mentally handicapped young woman, named Carla Tate, who returns home after spending eight years in a special school. Carla is very strong minded and wants to take classes at a local vocational school, move into her own apartment, and live a life of her own away from her family. She gets along with most of her family really well but is often in conflict with her controlling and demanding mother (Diane Keaton). While taking classes Carla meets a mentally challenged young man, Daniel (Giovani Ribisi) and the two quickly become good friends and eventually become romantic, a relationship which Carla's mother does not approve.I was pleasantly surprised by THE OTHER SISTER. I knew before hand that it was a &quot;chick flick&quot; and was directed by Garry Marshall. However, for the most part the movie worked. The acting was wonderful. The family struggles were lifelike. The simple adventures of Carla and Danny were rather believable, but Danny's more so because not many mentally handicapped people come from wealthy families like Carla's. Some of the scenes were quite humorous and some were rather touching, evoking real emotion.There are only two major complaints about the film. One, it was incredibly long (about 135 minutes). At points the movie was dragged out much too long and in those places the film lost some of it's poignancy. My only other complaint is that the film used THE GRADUATE throughout as a prop. I realize that often movies are influenced by other films and sometimes those films are even referenced and parts of them copied in another movie.

466479,AI1MNBBIZPBTJ,6305492042,"Vanessa ""amazon lover""","[0, 0]","I completely disagree with the amazon review at the top of the page. There was tension and conflict as the family- the mother in particular, tried to adjust to Carla's newly demanded independence. There are some very deep and touching scenes and the ending always brings me to tears. I think the person who wrote the review in the product description must have missed that. I agree with them however that the acting was superb. Govanni Risibi and Juliette Lewis give an extremely convincing performance which made you think twice about those we might usually dismiss.Diane Keaton is also one of my favorite actresses and shines as the quintessential charming and good-graced, albeit uptight mother.Essentially- the main message of the film is that special needs people think and feel the exact same things in romantic relationships. The boy-girl interractions between Carla are humourous just for the fact that they are so typical of male-female relations. Point: special needs or not- men will piss you off! Joke (I'm a woman). No, but seriously. Gary Marshall always delivers (Beaches, Pretty Woman, a League of Their Own- Penny Marshall)and this is no exception (you've even got a few extras who were in Pretty Woman starring in minor roles in this movie too). I like the fact that the usual themes that you would expect to find in dysfunctional upper-class families are also touched upon without it becoming too heavy. Additionally- the fact that the public school in the Bay area is actually portrayed with the type of people you would expect to find in a public school in the area. The makers did try to include some diversity- which is a plus for me. Good movie.",4,heart-warming...juliette lewis is a great actress,1313107200,"08 12, 2011",2011,1669,"['completely', 'disagree', 'amazon', 'review', 'top', 'page', 'was', 'tension', 'conflict', 'family-', 'mother', 'particular', 'tried', 'adjust', 'Carla', 'newly', 'demanded', 'independence', 'are', 'very', 'deep', 'touching', 'scenes', 'ending', 'always', 'tears', 'think', 'person', 'who', 'wrote', 'review', 'product', 'description', 'must', 'have', 'missed', 'agree', 'however', 'acting', 'was', 'superb', 'Govanni', 'Risibi', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'give', 'extremely', 'convincing', 'performance', 'made', 'think', 'twice', 'about', 'might', 'usually', 'dismiss.Diane', 'Keaton', 'also', 'one', 'favorite', 'actresses', 'shines', 'quintessential', 'charming', 'good-graced', 'albeit', 'uptight', 'mother.Essentially-', 'main', 'message', 'film', 'special', 'needs', 'people', 'think', 'feel', 'exact', 'same', 'things', 'romantic', 'relationships', 'boy-girl', 'interractions', 'Carla', 'are', 'humourous', 'just', 'fact', 'are', 'so', 'typical', 'male-female', 'relations', 'Point', 'special', 'needs', 'not-', 'men', 'will', 'piss', 'off', 'Joke', ""'m"", 'woman', 'No', 'seriously', 'Gary', 'Marshall', 'always', 'delivers', 'Beaches', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'League', 'Their', 'Own-', 'Penny', 'Marshall', 'exception', ""'ve"", 'even', 'got', 'few', 'extras', 'who', 'were', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'starring', 'minor', 'roles', 'movie', 'too', 'fact', 'usual', 'themes', 'would', 'expect', 'find', 'dysfunctional', 'upper-class', 'families', 'are', 'also', 'touched', 'becoming', 'too', 'heavy', 'Additionally-', 'fact', 'public', 'school', 'Bay', 'area', 'actually', 'portrayed', 'type', 'people', 'would', 'expect', 'find', 'public', 'school', 'area', 'makers', 'did', 'try', 'include', 'diversity-', 'plus', 'Good', 'movie']",The Other Sister VHS

Who can say that these are not real problems that one or two mentally challenged people would face?  Carla comes from a rich family... so, yes, she would have very different issues than Daniel would!  Just as there are millions of different people in the world, there will be a million different lives to live ... that means each person has their own sets of problems.  This movie is fun, funny, sweet, sad and loveable.  I watch it over and over and many of my friends and family have watched it and most have enjoyed it as well.

I recall watching this movie once a long time ago and was not a huge fan of the content (seems to be predominately a chick-flick). However, I can see the merit in viewing this movie at least once, regardless of gender or movie taste. This movie does a great job at presenting topics that are not often portrayed in Hollywood, but have real-life implications for many people. Overall, I feel that this was a great buy.
