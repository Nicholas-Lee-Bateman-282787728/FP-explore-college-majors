The good being, it was quite generic, yet solid with interesting characters. Even the obnoxious jerk behaves like he's unaware people are viewing him as one. What might interest people is the families band together to catch the monster before finding out that it's lethal instead of for survival. A saying I'm unsure of the original source, was something about leaving the audience wanting more, and I would've enjoyed seeing these characters more.The negatives - besides being anticlimactic there's something that keeps happening in the movies this company produces, which is quite atypical of normal horror, but I kinda know it's going to happen. I had some suspicions of who would die, which were technically inaccurate in the details but in general fell within the expected parameters.There's alternate artwork on the inside of the cover, which seems more appropriate for a film like this and should've been the front cover.MINOR SOAPBOX:One other issue: some people had issues with the monster effects. The monster was onscreen for maybe three minutes total. Frankly I can't consider that a significant issue, and don't understand why anyone would, especially since, well...I've left the immature/borderline trolling ""Jaws"" review I'd written from 2006 untouched to highlight that I've matured over the years.I consider it a good film though.

1523047,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B006Z7Z3NG,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 3]","Great character actors Michael Rooker and Blanche Baker headline this low budget shocker about a strange creature lurking beneath icy waters. While it's good to see these seasoned vets, I couldn't help but wish they had a better film to support their talents. While Rooker makes the most of his role as a father and husband pushed to defend his family, Baker seems oddly strained and robotic. But performances aside, there is little in ""Hypothermia"" to excite movie-goers. You've seen so many variations of this story (back to the Creature From The Black Lagoon), ""Hypothermia"" really needed to bring something new or interesting to the discussion. And it really doesn't. The plot, such as it is, seemed stretched even with a scant 73 minute running time. The screenplay forces characters to consistently make the most idiotic choices to protract the story to its bloody conclusion. For example, after battling the underwater monster through several deaths, one character decides to lay down right next to a fishing hole for a rest. Genius, huh? I know that's what I'd do! You'd have to be as lame-brained as the characters not to foresee the result of this poor decision.""Hypothermia"" is, in the most classic sense, a throw-back to the cheapie monster movies of the fifties. Wait until you get a look at the murderous creature in question. It's a guy in a poorly fitting SCUBA suit and a bad mask. Far more silly than horrifying, this is a movie that would definitely have benefited by leaving the menacing creature largely unseen. But that's not the choice the makers went with, the creature is front and center and elicits a few more laughs than screams. Rooker and his family have a house on the shores of an icy lake. He, his wife, his son, and his son's girlfriend wander out for a day of ice fishing. A couple of clowns show up to share the ice with them. The father is so over-the-top, he seems to be impersonating Danny McBride at his most outrageous. When encountered with the dangerous beast, they eschew all logical choices to serve themselves up as fish food. It's all so awkward and clunky and familiar, there's not much fun to be had.Maybe that's my primary problem with ""Hypothermia."" It takes itself so darn seriously. A little camp or humor would have lightened things up immeasurably. I love bad movie monster mayhem more than most. But ""Hypothermia"" wants to play as a straight-up shocker. But without genuine thrills or originality, it falls short of its goals. I loved the ridiculous creature! In a humorous spoof, it would have been an outrageously successful creation. But is it scary? Don't make me answer that. Enacting every cliche that you've come to expect, ""Hypothermia"" simply doesn't serve up satisfying drama or tension. The 73 minutes felt easily twice as long, especially when their cozy house is just a few paces away from the deadly mayhem. A silly and unoriginal misfire.

Michael Rooker does admirably in his roll as do a couple of the bit players and the frigid atmosphere of a deep winter Maine ice-fishing outing is well photographed. However .... there was some seriously ham-fisted acting, too obvious attack opportunities, a laughable ""creature"" that will be familiar to any one who watched the classic  'The Outer Limits' series and any cheap-o creature feature from the 50's - 60's that utilized a guy in a frogman suit with fins taped on and ping-pong balls used as eyes and - then - there's a hilarious' talking the monster down' epilogue. If the producers and creature (guy in ridiculous rubber suit) effects crew had put their hearts and another few thousand bucks into this, even with some shoddy acting, this could have been a righteously classic cult creature film.Sad to see the efforts of a couple of good performances sunk so deep in this clunker.

While they are out on the ice enjoying themselves another father and son show up and quickly start to annoy Ray and family. When they notice something ""as big as a sturgeon"" they come up with a plan to catch it. When it starts to attack them the plan changes and saving lives are the priority. I  am a fan of the cheesy sci/fy channel movies, the over the top acting and bad effects make them fun to watch, going in I was expecting that level of film making from this one. I have to say this was in most cases better then that level. The acting wasn't good but wasn't awful either. I can actually say that about most of the movie. While the movie isn't ""good"" it doesn't really do anything to annoy or make you want to stop watching. The movie seemed to know what it was and didn't try to do too much, which is a rare thing lately. The only exception to that was the last two minutes, without trying to give anything a way it was a HUGE cop-out ending and the horrible beast was pretty much a dude in a swamp thing costume you can find at Walmart...other then the ending though this wasn't terrible. Overall, not as bad as I expected and if you are into cheesy movies this one will do. I give it a C+.",2,A scy/fy channel like movie that was actually not that bad. Not offensive or that good just OK. Ending was awful.
