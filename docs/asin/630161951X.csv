258307,A3N0HBW8IP8CZQ,630161951X,"Melissa P. Cooper ""kymissyin""","[10, 13]","This one's a mixed bag--but Sela Ward and Michael Woods are AWESOME in every scene they have together.  I wouldn't spend the money that this website is charging for the video, however.  Seventy bucks for a made-for-TV movie?  Come on. Even the hot, hot theatrical releases don't cost that much on DVD when they first come out.  That's gotta be a typo. . .but I digress.I caught this one on ABCFamily Channel the other night, and while the setting is beautiful and the actors do a great job with the material they're given, something about the whole thing was just. . .off.Sela Ward--who stands with Jennifer Aniston and Susan Sarandon as one of the most beautiful women in show biz today--has the title role. We also see Roscoe Born--who played Joe Novak in ""Ryan's Hope""--as the childhood friend who's always been in love with Sarah and still is, even though she's chosen another man to marry. And Morgan Fairchild--another beautiful lady who, alas, always gets stuck with the second banana, duplicitous friend role. Michael Woods--a man with a very familiar face, maybe from print or TV ads--is Sarah's sexy new husband. (Someone give this man a starring role of his own--he's worth watching!!) Veteran actress and former cosmetics executive Polly Bergen is almost unrecognizable here as a longtime secretary/housekeeper to Sarah's family.This film is lovely to look at. Most of the action takes place at the mansion where Sarah grew up and has now returned to live as a newlywed. Both Sela and Morgan are elegantly dressed--although Morgan's clothing is always flashier, where Sela's is more understated and everyday elegant. And don't get me started on Michael Woods again--the man is a hunk:)The problems with this film begin in about the last half-hour to 45 minutes. It seems as though the directors took too much time setting things up, and then had to race to the finish, leaving out some things in the process. At the end of the film, you realize that there are two main characters who simply vanished from the storyline--and this would have been out of character for them, given the established plot. This is a real problem in the final scene, when it's implied that the previous scene happened early in the day and now it's night-time. The character who does not show up in the last scene would have definitely had time to get there and possibly change the outcome. Hello? What happened? Is there something we didn't see on the cutting room floor?This needs a sequel or to be re-released with the Director's cut. Like I said, it's just out of whack in some way. Again, I wouldn't pay anything to buy or rent it.  But next time it's rerun on TV, I would watch that first half-hour or so again just to watch Sela Ward and Michael Woods in the wedding and newlywed scenes.

258310,A3JTBJC5WSEZ7Q,630161951X,Thomas M. Sipos,"[2, 2]","Yes, Sela Ward looks great.  But horror fans will be disappointed by THE HAUNTING OF SARAH HARDY because this is NOT a horror film, despite the misleading title.  It's a soap opera/romance/suspense tale!To find out why, you must get past this...SPOILER ALERTThere's NO GHOST.  NO HAUNTING.  Which is pretty obvious from the start, to hardcore horror film viewers.  The ""hauntings"" look very fake.Sela Ward plays a classic romance heroine.  A beautiful young heiress, strong yet vulnerable.  She only wants to find love.  She thinks she finds this in the form of a strong-jawed stock broker, with classic romance hero looks.But 15 minutes into the film, it seems Sarah is haunted by her dead mother.  But the ""hauntings"" look fake, because they are.50 minutes into the film, we discover that Sarah's husband, and her best friend (Morgan Fairchild), are having an affair.  They want to drive Sarah insane, or kill her and make her death appear to be a suicide.They appear to succeed.  Sarah disappears, apparently drowning in the ocean (few viewers will buy this for an instant).During the next 40 minutes, Sarah, who's not really dead (no surprise -- we saw it coming), turns the tables and appears to haunt the evil couple.Near the film's end, Sarah's husband appears to die in a car accident, but he faked his death (once again, we saw that coming).In the last scene, Sarah sees a man in her bed.  She enters the bed, thinking it's her doctor friend.  But no -- it's her husband! (Sarah is the only person on the planet who didn't see that coming.)A dull, plodding romance/suspense soap opera.  I guess if you like the genre, you might like this film, but it's not for horror fans.If you're a Sela Ward fan AND a horror fan, I recommend CHILD OF DARKNESS, CHILD OF LIGHT.Like THE HAUNTING OF SARAH HARDY, CHILD OF DARKNESS, CHILD OF LIGHT is a made-for-cable TV movie, made about the same time (maybe within a year of each other), but this is a REAL horror film.  It's yet another ""coming of the antichrist"" films, but a good one.Sela Ward plays a nun, but Ward fans don't worry.  She gets possessed at one point, and gets very sexual.It's also a good horror film.",2,misleading and disappointing -- NOT a horror film,1246838400,"07 6, 2009",2009,2165,"['Yes', 'Sela', 'Ward', 'great', 'horror', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'THE', 'HAUNTING', 'OF', 'SARAH', 'HARDY', 'NOT', 'horror', 'film', 'misleading', 'title', 'soap', 'opera/romance/suspense', 'tale', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'must', 'get', 'SPOILER', 'ALERTThere', 'NO', 'GHOST', 'NO', 'HAUNTING', 'Which', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'start', 'hardcore', 'horror', 'film', 'viewers', 'hauntings', 'look', 'very', 'fake.Sela', 'Ward', 'classic', 'romance', 'heroine', 'beautiful', 'young', 'heiress', 'strong', 'yet', 'vulnerable', 'only', 'find', 'love', 'form', 'strong-jawed', 'stock', 'broker', 'classic', 'romance', 'hero', 'looks.But', '15', 'minutes', 'film', 'Sarah', 'haunted', 'dead', 'mother', 'hauntings', 'look', 'fake', 'are.50', 'minutes', 'film', 'discover', 'Sarah', 'husband', 'best', 'friend', 'Morgan', 'Fairchild', 'are', 'having', 'affair', 'want', 'drive', 'Sarah', 'insane', 'kill', 'make', 'death', 'appear', 'be', 'suicide.They', 'appear', 'succeed', 'Sarah', 'apparently', 'drowning', 'ocean', 'few', 'viewers', 'will', 'buy', 'instant', '.During', 'next', '40', 'minutes', 'Sarah', 'who', 'not', 'really', 'dead', 'surprise', 'saw', 'coming', 'tables', 'haunt', 'evil', 'couple.Near', 'film', 'end', 'Sarah', 'husband', 'die', 'car', 'accident', 'faked', 'death', 'once', 'again', 'saw', 'coming', 'last', 'scene', 'Sarah', 'man', 'bed', 'bed', 'thinking', 'doctor', 'friend', 'husband', 'Sarah', 'only', 'person', 'planet', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'dull', 'plodding', 'romance/suspense', 'soap', 'opera', 'guess', 'like', 'genre', 'might', 'like', 'film', 'not', 'horror', 'fans.If', ""'re"", 'Sela', 'Ward', 'fan', 'horror', 'fan', 'recommend', 'CHILD', 'OF', 'DARKNESS', 'CHILD', 'OF', 'LIGHT.Like', 'THE', 'HAUNTING', 'OF', 'SARAH', 'HARDY', 'CHILD', 'OF', 'DARKNESS', 'CHILD', 'OF', 'LIGHT', 'made-for-cable', 'TV', 'movie', 'made', 'same', 'time', 'maybe', 'year', 'other', 'REAL', 'horror', 'film', 'yet', 'coming', 'antichrist', 'films', 'good', 'one.Sela', 'Ward', 'nun', 'Ward', 'fans', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'possessed', 'one', 'point', 'very', 'sexual.It', 'also', 'good', 'horror', 'film']",N/A
258311,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,630161951X,Z Hayes,"[2, 2]","I came across this 1989 title while browsing older movies on Youtube (it is amazing how many movies are available there, especially older, hard to come by movies). Since this isn't even available on DVD, I felt fortunate to be able to watch the entire film online.Contrary to its title, this is not a horror movie but more of a psychological thriller. Sela Ward plays Sarah Hardy, an heiress who as a child witnessed her mother's suicide after her father's death. Sarah has not returned to her ancestral home, The Pines for the last fifteen years because of painful memories, but after her marriage to stockbroker Austin (Michael Woods), she decides to move back and put her ghosts to rest.Easier said than done - as soon as Sarah begins living at The Pines again, she experiences strange occurrences and begins to wonder if she is losing her grip on reality. Roscoe Born plays her childhood friend Allen, who is also her therapist. Allen has loved Sarah for a long time, and continues to love her even though she is now another man's wife. There's also Morgan Fairchild playing the role of Sarah's best friend, Lucy, a TV actress. Polly Bergen puts in a strong performance as housekeeper and retainer, Emily Stepford who has served Sarah's family for many years.There are some surreal moments in the film, which causes confusion at times as I was trying to figure out what was real and what was imagined, but overall I thought this was quite a decent TV thriller which I actually enjoyed more than some of the more popular movies masquerading as thrillers.
