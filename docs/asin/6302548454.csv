All I have to say about this film is that it is indeed worth a look, if simply to see Bette Davis past her prime years at Warner Bros.The film is talky and if you can sit through it all in one sitting without snoozing from time to time....(I had to watch it four times before I could see it all .....)....you are a great Bette Davis fan and my hat is off to you!This film does have its memorable moments and it is interesting to watch Davis subdued and restrained.  The last shot of the film is particularly moving.It is no surprise that this film did not do well at the box office when it was released in 1948.  Jack Warner, head of production at Warners was tired of Bette at this point and it would only take two more films before he was rid of her.  Studio politics were rampant in Hollywood and forgetting all the millions she made for the studio in the past, relegated her to mediocrity in films like Winter Meeting.However, the film does have its merits....the acting is good (Davis pulls it up to her level and Jim Davis is properly convincing as a war hero torn between a vocation for marriage and a vocation to the priesthood.)Davis made far worse debacles in her career and this film is different because it features Bette in a 'quiet' role for a change.......not one full of hammy mannerisms that tended to taint a lot of her other performances.  But as she once said, ""MY acting hammy is what the public expects"".  It is interesting to see a different side of her.",3,NOT BETTE'S BEST,1092787200,"08 18, 2004",2004,1555,"['can', 'not', 'add', 'anything', 'plot', 'detailed', 'here', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'say', 'film', 'indeed', 'worth', 'look', 'simply', 'see', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'prime', 'years', 'Warner', 'Bros.The', 'film', 'talky', 'can', 'sit', 'one', 'sitting', 'snoozing', 'time', 'time', 'had', 'watch', 'four', 'times', 'could', 'see', '..', 'are', 'great', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'fan', 'hat', 'film', 'have', 'memorable', 'moments', 'interesting', 'watch', 'Davis', 'subdued', 'restrained', 'last', 'shot', 'film', 'particularly', 'moving.It', 'surprise', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'well', 'box', 'office', 'when', 'was', 'released', '1948', 'Jack', 'Warner', 'head', 'production', 'Warners', 'was', 'tired', 'Bette', 'point', 'would', 'only', 'take', 'two', 'more', 'films', 'was', 'rid', 'Studio', 'politics', 'were', 'rampant', 'Hollywood', 'forgetting', 'millions', 'made', 'studio', 'past', 'relegated', 'mediocrity', 'films', 'Winter', 'Meeting.However', 'film', 'have', 'merits', '.the', 'acting', 'good', 'Davis', 'up', 'level', 'Jim', 'Davis', 'properly', 'convincing', 'war', 'hero', 'torn', 'vocation', 'marriage', 'vocation', 'priesthood', 'Davis', 'made', 'far', 'worse', 'debacles', 'career', 'film', 'different', 'Bette', ""'quiet"", 'role', 'change', '.not', 'one', 'full', 'hammy', 'mannerisms', 'tended', 'taint', 'lot', 'other', 'performances', 'once', 'said', 'acting', 'hammy', 'what', 'public', 'interesting', 'see', 'different', 'side']",N/A

319681,A35LWA8VY66G8F,6302548454,Daniel G. Madigan,"[1, 2]","""Winter Meeting"" is a film Bette Davis never liked. She wanted Jim Davis for the male lead and when she and others saw his screen test they balked. Richard Widmark was selected to replace him but Warner wouldn't hear of it, so on they went with a censored screenplay, Jim Davis, and Bette's frustrations.The result is a great performance by Bette Davis as always. Here she works very hard to put her arch character across, and she does so with subtlety and a million gestures, small ones, that define her as a poet,a friend of other artists, and a lover of a war hero. I think that because she decided to be generous to Jim Davis he comes across very well, and then Bette picks up so many scenes of his that would have been difficult for him, making him seem truly akward, disturbed, and kind of in love with Bette.She in turn makes the relationship tentative, edgy. In the midst of their talks she reveals her dysfunctional past and you can see that his answers do not satisfy at the moment he tells her what she must do, but later she makes the gesture to call an important person and all is well, seemingly well. She's back being herself again, back now tending to others, and now unloved and unmarried. But his advice was solid and she follows it.The priesthood business is true enough in its simplicity; Jim Davis was saved from death and now wants to atone in some way, make it all up to God. It plays out in a disturbing manner and you can see it on Bette's face. It's hard for him to convince us that this is what he needs to do. And that's the point, he cannot convice us. It's an escape, not a good one at all, and this loss of him to a more dysfunctional life than Bette as Susan had, adds to the pathos of ""Winter Meeting."" Bette's grief at his departure is stunningly played. The chill of winter sets in as he leaves and she copes with a past that was unsavory and a present that is barren and loveless.There is a beautiful score to this film and a very good Janis Paige on tap, a protegee of Bette's.

319683,A1L43KWWR05PCS,6302548454,Lawyeraau,"[12, 13]","This is a largely mediocre film with a story that is somewhat implausible. Bette Davis stars as Susan Grieve, a well to do poetess living in a very plush townhouse in New York City. She dresses divinely in black for all her social engagements and is articulate and low key in demeanor. She is a single woman in an era when such were called spinsters. She leads a well ordered life devoid of any romantic interests.Enter a romantic war hero with the improbable name of Slick Novak, played by the boyishly good looking and earnest James Davis. It seems that our hero is invited out to dinner by an upper crust friend of Ms. Grieve named Stacey, wonderfully played by the urbane John Hoyt. Stacey also invites Ms. Grieve, as well as his secretary, played by the lusciously lovely Janis Paige. Stacey believes that Slick will fall for his secretary, when to his and everyone's surprise, Slick falls for the prim and proper Susan.Susan awakens under the tender and romantic ministrations of Slick and finds herself falling in love. She is brought up short, however, when he discloses that he always wanted to be a priest and appears to be in some personal turmoil over it. Shortly after his disclosure, he suddenly pulls the rug out from under Susan. What follows is somewhat difficult to fathom and the movie, which had started out promisingly, begins to collapse. The only thing that saves the film are the wonderful performances by the cast.Ms. Davis gives a memorable performance as a woman who comes out of her shell and becomes more three dimensional. James Davis is credible as an angst ridden war hero who falls in love with the reluctant Susan, who, as the viewer discovers, has her own secret, inner turmoil. John Hoyt is delightful as Susan's well to do, dapper and socially prominent confidant and friend. Janis Paige, as a young working woman on the make, succeeds in her role. Unfortunately, the screen play misses its mark and, what could have been a great movie, is merely mediocre, worthy only for the notable performances given by the cast. The performance by Ms. Davis, in particular, makes the film worth watching, despite the somewhat plodding script.",3,SO SO FILM...GREAT CAST,1004745600,"11 3, 2001",2001,2167,"['largely', 'mediocre', 'film', 'story', 'somewhat', 'implausible', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'Susan', 'Grieve', 'well', 'do', 'poetess', 'living', 'very', 'plush', 'townhouse', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'divinely', 'black', 'social', 'engagements', 'articulate', 'low', 'key', 'demeanor', 'single', 'woman', 'era', 'when', 'such', 'were', 'called', 'spinsters', 'well', 'ordered', 'life', 'devoid', 'romantic', 'interests.Enter', 'romantic', 'war', 'hero', 'improbable', 'name', 'Slick', 'Novak', 'played', 'boyishly', 'good', 'looking', 'earnest', 'James', 'Davis', 'hero', 'invited', 'dinner', 'upper', 'crust', 'friend', 'Ms.', 'Grieve', 'named', 'Stacey', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'urbane', 'John', 'Hoyt', 'Stacey', 'also', 'Ms.', 'Grieve', 'as', 'well', 'secretary', 'played', 'lusciously', 'lovely', 'Janis', 'Paige', 'Stacey', 'Slick', 'will', 'fall', 'secretary', 'when', 'everyone', 'surprise', 'Slick', 'prim', 'proper', 'Susan.Susan', 'awakens', 'tender', 'romantic', 'ministrations', 'Slick', 'falling', 'love', 'brought', 'up', 'short', 'however', 'when', 'always', 'wanted', 'be', 'priest', 'be', 'personal', 'turmoil', 'Shortly', 'disclosure', 'suddenly', 'rug', 'Susan', 'What', 'somewhat', 'difficult', 'fathom', 'movie', 'had', 'started', 'out', 'promisingly', 'collapse', 'only', 'thing', 'film', 'are', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'cast.Ms', 'Davis', 'memorable', 'performance', 'woman', 'who', 'shell', 'more', 'three', 'dimensional', 'James', 'Davis', 'credible', 'angst', 'ridden', 'war', 'hero', 'who', 'love', 'reluctant', 'Susan', 'who', 'viewer', 'discovers', 'own', 'secret', 'inner', 'turmoil', 'John', 'Hoyt', 'delightful', 'Susan', 'well', 'do', 'dapper', 'socially', 'prominent', 'confidant', 'friend', 'Janis', 'Paige', 'young', 'working', 'woman', 'make', 'role', 'Unfortunately', 'screen', 'play', 'mark', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'movie', 'merely', 'mediocre', 'worthy', 'only', 'notable', 'performances', 'given', 'cast', 'performance', 'Ms.', 'Davis', 'particular', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'somewhat', 'plodding', 'script']",N/A
319684,A1O79Y7BTGJF8K,6302548454,"MasterMarquette ""Karim Marquette""","[3, 4]","The plot synopsis and excellence of acting is mentioned in other reviews.However, the psychological crises depicted in this story are dramatic and timeless.  An adapted screenplay, I wonder how much of the book was unable to translate to film.  I imagine the book probed far deeper into the main characters, Susan Grieve and Slick Novak.I don't think it's an accident the author chose the last name ""Grieve"", as the character is still in grief from her father's death. This character wearing mostly black clothing stood out especially in the beginning of the movie, I wondered ""who died?"".  She is troubled on a deep level regarding her mother.  Her mother left the house while she was quite young and was, apparently, responsible for her father's (a pastor) broken heart and ultimate demise just five years before this story plays out.Novak is a troubled war hero, who shuns the newspaper headlines of his return home and the hometown parade in his honor.  Instead, we find him seemingly an alcoholic who doesn't care a bit about his ""hero"" status.  The revelation of why he shuns this status is believable, the submarine from which he saved a few lives was later torpedoed and all were killed.  Hollywood's grand portrayals of war often omit the trauma which some soldiers experience, something now called Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome (PTSS).Bette Davis and Jim Davis do an excellent job of delivering the subtle nuances of these troubled characters, despite a lackluster script.  Yet, the overarching theme of this story is of forgiveness. In Grieve's case, forgiving Novak and then her mother, mostly due to Novak's intervention.  In Novak's case, I believe he forgives himself for the pride bestowed upon a hero.  He comes to terms with his past and sees hope in fulfilling his dream of becoming a priest.  Despite the many flaws of this film, this theme is delivered forcefully.  Forgiveness is a complex emotional journey, this is one of the best films I've seen about it.  The character development happens near the end of the film, climaxing in the final scene.  It brought me to tears.",4,Vastly Underrated Film,1287100800,"10 15, 2010",2010,2097,"['plot', 'synopsis', 'excellence', 'acting', 'mentioned', 'other', 'reviews.However', 'psychological', 'crises', 'depicted', 'story', 'are', 'dramatic', 'timeless', 'adapted', 'screenplay', 'wonder', 'how', 'much', 'book', 'was', 'unable', 'translate', 'film', 'imagine', 'book', 'probed', 'far', 'deeper', 'main', 'characters', 'Susan', 'Grieve', 'Slick', 'Novak.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'accident', 'author', 'chose', 'last', 'name', 'Grieve', 'character', 'still', 'grief', 'father', 'death', 'character', 'wearing', 'mostly', 'black', 'clothing', 'stood', 'out', 'especially', 'beginning', 'movie', 'wondered', 'who', 'died', 'troubled', 'deep', 'level', 'regarding', 'mother', 'mother', 'left', 'house', 'was', 'quite', 'young', 'was', 'apparently', 'responsible', 'father', 'pastor', 'broken', 'heart', 'ultimate', 'demise', 'just', 'five', 'years', 'story', 'out.Novak', 'troubled', 'war', 'hero', 'who', 'newspaper', 'headlines', 'return', 'home', 'hometown', 'parade', 'honor', 'Instead', 'find', 'seemingly', 'alcoholic', 'who', ""n't"", 'care', 'bit', 'hero', 'status', 'revelation', 'why', 'status', 'believable', 'submarine', 'saved', 'few', 'lives', 'was', 'later', 'torpedoed', 'were', 'killed', 'Hollywood', 'grand', 'portrayals', 'war', 'often', 'trauma', 'soldiers', 'experience', 'something', 'now', 'called', 'Post', 'Traumatic', 'Stress', 'Syndrome', 'PTSS', '.Bette', 'Davis', 'Jim', 'Davis', 'do', 'excellent', 'job', 'delivering', 'subtle', 'nuances', 'troubled', 'characters', 'lackluster', 'script', 'overarching', 'theme', 'story', 'forgiveness', 'Grieve', 'case', 'forgiving', 'Novak', 'then', 'mother', 'mostly', 'due', 'Novak', 'intervention', 'Novak', 'case', 'believe', 'pride', 'bestowed', 'hero', 'terms', 'past', 'sees', 'hope', 'fulfilling', 'dream', 'becoming', 'priest', 'many', 'flaws', 'film', 'theme', 'delivered', 'forcefully', 'Forgiveness', 'complex', 'emotional', 'journey', 'one', 'best', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'character', 'development', 'end', 'film', 'climaxing', 'final', 'scene', 'brought', 'tears']",N/A

WINTER MEETING however, if anything, confirmed Davis as the best actress of her time. In her imperious moments, she is mannered, but in her quieter moments, there is no one as relaxed or able to suggest a ""thinking woman"". She plays a spinster publisher involved with a naval hero (Jim Davis, later known as Jock Ewing on TV's DALLAS), a relationship likely to be futile, since he wants to become a priest. This actor's lumbering integrity is quite convincing, but at the time, he shared in the opprobrium cast upon the film by reviewers, possibly bewildered by a SUGGESTION of depth and an almost complete lack of melodrama. The ending is trite, but under Bretaigne Windust's (what a name!) direction, the film is sharp on certain strata of New York society, and Catherine Turney's dialogue, if anything, avoids cliches.
