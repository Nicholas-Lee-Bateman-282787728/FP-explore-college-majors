They add their special talents to this movie and their faces to the cover, a big reason why I bought it. Mr. Henriksen repeats his classic role as the controling mad man behind the scenes. Mr. Rossi, playing a cop, doesn't get to display his usual cocky attitude much, a drawback he overcomes. Anther great in this movie of doublecross is David Warner (Wax Works, Time After Time). His British cool is perfect as the resourceful rougue CIA agent. Jeffery Combs (Re-animator) takes a step out of the sci-fi realm here portraying a film maker, but one keeps expecting him to revert any minute. Other greats are Joe Don Baker (Walking Tall) and Charles Napier (Hit List). Ashley Lawrence (Hellraiser) is the girl trying to do good. There's plenty of action and nothing is what it seems. Worth buying or renting to see these great actors together.",4,"Great cast keeps up ""Felony""s interest",1003622400,"10 21, 2001",2001,949,"['Lance', 'Henriksen', 'Hard', 'Target', 'Millennium', 'Leo', 'Rossi', 'Relentless', 'are', 'together', 'again', 'Hit', 'List', 'add', 'special', 'talents', 'movie', 'cover', 'big', 'reason', 'why', 'bought', 'Mr.', 'Henriksen', 'classic', 'role', 'controling', 'mad', 'man', 'scenes', 'Mr.', 'Rossi', 'playing', 'cop', ""n't"", 'get', 'display', 'usual', 'cocky', 'attitude', 'much', 'drawback', 'Anther', 'great', 'movie', 'doublecross', 'David', 'Warner', 'Wax', 'Works', 'Time', 'Time', 'British', 'cool', 'perfect', 'resourceful', 'rougue', 'CIA', 'agent', 'Jeffery', 'Combs', 'Re-animator', 'step', 'sci-fi', 'realm', 'here', 'portraying', 'film', 'maker', 'one', 'expecting', 'revert', 'minute', 'Other', 'greats', 'are', 'Joe', 'Don', 'Baker', 'Walking', 'Tall', 'Charles', 'Napier', 'Hit', 'List', 'Ashley', 'Lawrence', 'Hellraiser', 'girl', 'trying', 'do', 'good', 'plenty', 'action', 'nothing', 'what', 'Worth', 'buying', 'renting', 'see', 'great', 'actors', 'together']",Felony VHS
387090,A2SKHUNCGF9RKR,6303867901,Dee Mess,"[5, 6]","Although I'm sure it was not the intent of anyone involved in its making, this movie is a *laugh riot*.My interest in ""Felony"" is the ensemble of actors they've put together--David Warner!!! Lance Henriksen!! Jeffrey Combs!! Joe Don Baker!! Charles Napier!! My God, what a cast!The story is some vague, double-crossing FBI/drug running thing (not to--heh!--spoil it, for anyone), but I can't say I was really watching for the plot. The movie could have been about just about anything, and, with that cast, I would have bought it.It was a joy to watch these actors--some of them, my very favorites--together.The highlights for me: David Warner driving a pickup truck, and dropping an F-bomb; Jeffery Combs (in the Bruce Campbell role, apparently) escaping Joe Don Baker's rescue, and later, crashing through his front window when he could have very easily gone through the door he had just used; and, finally, David Warner telling Lance that Joe Don was ""just waiting for us to do something stupid"" and Lance replying, ""It's FAR too late for that."" My husband and I had to pause the movie--we were laughing too hard to hear any more dialogue.It's really not a bad movie, by any means; it's just rather clumsily put together. The cast does what they can, and it is because of them that ""Felony"" is in any way watchable.

The writing is illogical, the directing is choppy and disjointed, and the acting is awful, with one exception.  The camera work looks like a poorly done television production.
