Everybody loves ""Wizard of Oz"", of course I love it too, but take a look ""Everybody Sing"". This is the real Judy I think. ""Wizard of Oz"" is a great movie but there is not Judy Garland there is Drothy, you see.Judy Garland is a great entertainer and this movie is the best to see such her talent in her early days and also co-staring is very nice. I don't know Fanny Brice's performance very well but she was like born to make people laugh.The story is as cheap as classical musical usually is, but the musical sean is so wounderful.My favorite seans are which Judy sings Mendelssohn with swing rhythm, or which Judy sing a blues in an audition for restrant with black-face like Al Jolson, or which in a bus sean Judy and other casts sing ""Down"".Oh my god!

My mother alwaysliked to go to the theater on Friday night. Everybody Sing was the movie we watched and loved. I watched Judy dance andI jumped up and started dancing. My mother grabbed me and said &#34;Wait until we go home!&#34;  When I watched the movietonight, I remembered that Friday night and what great talent we had from Hollywood in those days.This is a wonderful movie with great talent, dancing, singing and acting.  Judy Garland was always my favorite. Bille Burkewas my mother's favorite and the great talent of Fanny Brice. Allan Jones had a marvelous voice. All the supportingactors were great and the stage settings were beautiful.My father was overseas in Europe and we were very depressed about the War. We needed Hollywood to cheer us up and theydid a very good job during that time in our lives. Oh, I did dance when I got home!

308241,A37S3ACL57LN62,6302341108,"Samantha Glasser ""Maliejandra""","[9, 9]","Everybody Sing is the story of an insane family (all somehow involved in show business, which makes them a bit eccentric). The youngest daughter of the family (Judy Garland), has been expelled from four schools due to her intense adoration for jazz and swing music. She has a right to; that is the type of music she excells at singing, and we get to hear a lot of it. Her parents just don't understand, so they attempt to send her away again, but she escapes so she can join a musical describing her own feelings on music.Judy Garland is wonderful here in a very early part where her eyebrows are still plucked down and her body has not been restrained to make her look younger. Despite how different she looks, her personality and voice shine through and prove that even at this young age, Judy was a force to be reckoned with. All of her songs are sung with heart, even the one she performs in blackface, and each song is so good it is a shame it is not better known.Fanny Brice makes a rare film appearance here as Olga, the housekeeper for the family. She is wry, intelligent, and very funny throughout. She also makes an appearance in a few musical numbers that show off her abilities as a comedienne which were made famous on the Ziegfeld stage.Overall, this is a very fun film filled with good musical numbers and a great cast.",4,Why Sing When You Can Swing?,1152748800,"07 13, 2006",2006,1334,"['Everybody', 'Sing', 'story', 'insane', 'family', 'somehow', 'involved', 'show', 'business', 'bit', 'eccentric', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'family', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'been', 'expelled', 'four', 'schools', 'due', 'intense', 'adoration', 'jazz', 'swing', 'music', 'right', 'type', 'music', 'singing', 'get', 'hear', 'lot', 'parents', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'attempt', 'send', 'away', 'again', 'so', 'can', 'join', 'musical', 'describing', 'own', 'feelings', 'music.Judy', 'Garland', 'wonderful', 'here', 'very', 'early', 'part', 'where', 'eyebrows', 'are', 'still', 'plucked', 'down', 'body', 'not', 'been', 'restrained', 'make', 'look', 'younger', 'how', 'different', 'personality', 'voice', 'shine', 'prove', 'even', 'young', 'age', 'Judy', 'was', 'force', 'be', 'reckoned', 'songs', 'are', 'sung', 'heart', 'even', 'one', 'blackface', 'song', 'so', 'good', 'shame', 'not', 'better', 'known.Fanny', 'Brice', 'rare', 'film', 'appearance', 'here', 'Olga', 'housekeeper', 'family', 'wry', 'intelligent', 'very', 'funny', 'also', 'appearance', 'few', 'musical', 'numbers', 'show', 'abilities', 'comedienne', 'were', 'made', 'famous', 'Ziegfeld', 'stage.Overall', 'very', 'fun', 'film', 'filled', 'good', 'musical', 'numbers', 'great', 'cast']",N/A

The film features many catchy tunes including ""Down on Melody Farm"", ""Swing Mr. Mendhelsson"", and ""Why? Because"". For anyone who is an avid 1930s MGM movie fan, there are dozens of character actors that are readily recognizable. Reginald Owen as Judy's blow hard father, Reginald Gardiner as a pompous actor, Billie Burke as Judy's ham actress mother, and Monty Woolley as an exasperated backer for a play are all wonderful! It's certainly a treat to see Judy Garland and Billie Burke together before they were Dorothy and Glinda the Good Witch. The film has a witty script with Fanny Brice as the main comic influence.
