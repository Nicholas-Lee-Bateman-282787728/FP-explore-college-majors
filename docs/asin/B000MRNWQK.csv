1050444,A37FUJC2L7DSPT,B000MRNWQK,"J. L LaRegina ""Jim LaRegina""","[0, 0]","Is the 2007 documentary FIRED! supposed to be about losing one's job for just or unjust reasons, as in stealing from the cash register or discrimination, respectively?  Or is this film about being not so much fired, which implies punitive action, and more in the sense of a layoff, where there just isn't enough work for the staff so some are dismissed?  Or, is it about losing a job that was going to end anyway, which is the situation that inspires actor Annabelle Gurwitch to make FIRED! after being fired from a play by a famous director, by definition temporary employment?FIRED! seems to be about all three scenarios though the way it zigs and zags, you may not be sure if that's its purpose.  I'm not sure Ms. Gurwitch and her fellow filmmakers have much in mind other than to send her out to talk to anyone who will listen about what happened to her at her acting job.  Try talking to everyone about the same topic and you'll get what we see in FIRED!: Some responses are interesting, others aren't.  FIRED!'s attempts are humor are less successful.I wrongly thought FIRED! was going to address the American government's appalling lack of a long overdue (by about 30 years as I write this in 2014) jobs program.  However, the closest to anything other than one personal account of unemployment after the next it comes to solutions is interviews with a career counselor and a seminar on jobs (or something) Gurwitch attends where, once again, she tells everyone about being fired from a play by that famous director.",2,We'll call you,1397952000,"04 20, 2014",2014,1523,"['2007', 'documentary', 'FIRED', 'supposed', 'be', 'losing', 'one', 'job', 'just', 'unjust', 'reasons', 'stealing', 'cash', 'register', 'discrimination', 'respectively', 'film', 'being', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'fired', 'punitive', 'action', 'more', 'sense', 'layoff', 'where', 'there', 'just', ""n't"", 'enough', 'work', 'staff', 'are', 'dismissed', 'losing', 'job', 'was', 'going', 'end', 'anyway', 'situation', 'actor', 'Annabelle', 'Gurwitch', 'make', 'FIRED', 'being', 'fired', 'play', 'famous', 'director', 'definition', 'temporary', 'employment', 'FIRED', 'be', 'three', 'scenarios', 'way', 'zags', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'sure', 'purpose', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'Ms.', 'Gurwitch', 'fellow', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'much', 'mind', 'other', 'send', 'out', 'talk', 'anyone', 'who', 'will', 'listen', 'what', 'happened', 'acting', 'job', 'Try', 'talking', 'everyone', 'same', 'topic', ""'ll"", 'get', 'what', 'see', 'FIRED', 'responses', 'are', 'interesting', 'others', 'are', ""n't"", 'FIRED', 'attempts', 'are', 'humor', 'are', 'less', 'successful.I', 'wrongly', 'thought', 'FIRED', 'was', 'going', 'address', 'American', 'government', 'appalling', 'lack', 'long', 'overdue', '30', 'years', 'write', '2014', 'jobs', 'program', 'However', 'closest', 'anything', 'other', 'one', 'personal', 'account', 'unemployment', 'next', 'solutions', 'interviews', 'career', 'counselor', 'seminar', 'jobs', 'something', 'Gurwitch', 'where', 'once', 'again', 'everyone', 'being', 'fired', 'play', 'famous', 'director']",Fired!
1050445,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000MRNWQK,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[9, 12]","Actress/comedienne Annabelle Gurwitch has made a nice little career for herself from being fired.  Unceremoniously dumped from a Woody Allen play for appearing to be ""retarded,"" Gurwitch has channeled this negative experience into new creative processes.  ""Fired!"" is a semi-documentary that is the culmination of this event--a chance for her to expand upon this one incident and to reveal universal truths behind the repercussions of being abandoned by your job.  In this wildly uneven film, Gurwitch does manage to amuse with stories from the entertainment community.  However, when trying to relate to the real world, the results are decidedly mixed.First, the good.  Gurwitch is an appealing personality and an engaging host.  Even in forced situations, she's a likable presence.  Gurwitch has many friends in the entertainment community (mostly comedic actors) and their stories provide genuine amusement.  She even put together a stage show where her friends shared their experiences with a live audience.  It looks like great fun, and if Gurwitch had stayed focused on these elements--""Fired!"" might have been a rousing success.Now, the not-so-good.  ""Fired!"" doesn't really know what it wants to be.  There are quite a few comedy bits inserted into the film that undermine the documentary feel.  From the staged recreation of Woody Allen letting her go, to David Cross' phony advice which leads to a self indulgent skit, to a bizarrely unnecessary romp with Andy Dick serving food--Gurwitch wants to appeal to everyone.  That's fine, I suppose--but the tone of the piece shifts all over the place.  From Dick's outrageousness in a contrived setup to the plight of the autoworkers facing mass layoffs--that is a huge leap.  In the serious bits, Gurwitch does well interviewing professionals about the psychological implications of being let go.  One on one, she's fine.  But other times, she inserts herself into real situations that seem inappropriate.  Attending class to help individuals transition into new professions, her Woody Allen story seems trite compared to people who might be having actual problems.Overall, ""Fired!"" is pleasant enough.  If Gurwitch had limited her scope to the entertainment industry, she might have crafted an uproarious and fun film.  But by venturing into the real world, the film falters.  It's still watchable--it just isn't as enlightening as it seems to think it is.

1050446,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000MRNWQK,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 2]","***1/2They say that when life hands you a lemon, make lemonade.  Well, that's pretty much what actress/comedienne Annabelle Gurwitch did when she was summarily fired from a Woody Allen play.  She turned her experience first into a successful stage show, and then into a feature-length documentary, appropriately entitled ""Fired!""Gurwitch uses this film not merely as therapy for herself but as a means of comforting other people who have experienced the same situation.  In wildly funny terms, the filmmaker reenacts the euphoric moment when she first heard that she had been hired by the great director, then the personally devastating scene when she was dismissed from the production, and finally the initial dark days of depression immediately following the canning.  She then chronicles the proactive steps she took to convert her sour experience into a sweet-tasting personal triumph.  After seeking solace and advice from an assortment of friends, therapists and clergy (also reenacted here), she decided to delve into other people's stories about being fired and to use them as material for a stand-up comedy stage show of which she herself was the host.  When that turned out to be a hit, Gurwitch decided to make a documentary film about the experience.In the movie, she interviews well-known comic celebrities such as Fred Willard, Anne Meara, Tim Allen, Andy Dick, Illeana Douglas and others on their experiences of losing a job and provides snippets of her stage show as well.  She also sets up a booth at a local job fair to hear the firing stories of some of the people there.  Towards the end of the movie, Gurwitch launches her own Michael Moore-style investigation into some of the dismissal practices of massive corporations like GM, and interviews people whose job it is to ""soften the blow"" of firing.With this small but entertaining film, Gurwitch and her comic buddies gently apply the healing balm of laughter to one of the most painful aspects of human life.",3,funny take on a serious theme,1186012800,"08 2, 2007",2007,1982,"['***1/2They', 'say', 'when', 'life', 'lemon', 'make', 'lemonade', 'Well', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'Annabelle', 'Gurwitch', 'did', 'when', 'was', 'summarily', 'fired', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'play', 'turned', 'experience', 'first', 'successful', 'stage', 'show', 'then', 'feature-length', 'documentary', 'appropriately', 'entitled', 'Fired', 'Gurwitch', 'film', 'not', 'merely', 'therapy', 'herself', 'means', 'comforting', 'other', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'experienced', 'same', 'situation', 'wildly', 'funny', 'terms', 'filmmaker', 'euphoric', 'moment', 'when', 'first', 'heard', 'had', 'been', 'hired', 'great', 'director', 'then', 'personally', 'devastating', 'scene', 'when', 'was', 'dismissed', 'production', 'finally', 'initial', 'dark', 'days', 'depression', 'immediately', 'following', 'canning', 'then', 'proactive', 'steps', 'took', 'convert', 'sour', 'experience', 'sweet-tasting', 'personal', 'triumph', 'seeking', 'solace', 'advice', 'assortment', 'friends', 'therapists', 'clergy', 'also', 'reenacted', 'here', 'decided', 'delve', 'other', 'people', 'stories', 'being', 'fired', 'use', 'material', 'stand-up', 'comedy', 'stage', 'show', 'was', 'host', 'When', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'hit', 'Gurwitch', 'decided', 'make', 'documentary', 'film', 'experience.In', 'movie', 'well-known', 'comic', 'celebrities', 'such', 'Fred', 'Willard', 'Anne', 'Meara', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'Andy', 'Dick', 'Illeana', 'Douglas', 'others', 'experiences', 'losing', 'job', 'snippets', 'stage', 'show', 'as', 'well', 'also', 'up', 'booth', 'local', 'job', 'fair', 'hear', 'firing', 'stories', 'people', 'there', 'end', 'movie', 'Gurwitch', 'own', 'Michael', 'Moore-style', 'investigation', 'dismissal', 'practices', 'massive', 'corporations', 'GM', 'interviews', 'people', 'job', 'soften', 'blow', 'firing.With', 'small', 'entertaining', 'film', 'Gurwitch', 'comic', 'buddies', 'gently', 'apply', 'healing', 'balm', 'laughter', 'one', 'most', 'painful', 'aspects', 'human', 'life']",Fired!

Annabelle Gurwitch gets people to tell their getting fired stories, and when they are stories about crappy jobs and insufferable employers, it's pretty funny. When it gets serious (people with long-term jobs getting cast off in corporate reorgs while the execs get big bonuses), it's out of its depth. It isn't always the case that losing a job means you're in the wrong one, as Gurwitch seems to believe, yet she includes no stories of those whose lives crashed and burned and never recovered after getting a pink slip.That caveat aside, there are many laughs to be had in this documentary, and they are often exhilarating. Celebrity interviews include Anne Meara, Jeff Garlin, Tim Allen, and Harry Shearer.
