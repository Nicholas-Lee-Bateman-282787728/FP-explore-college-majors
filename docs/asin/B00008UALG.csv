747407,AJYILFULOQ3CX,B00008UALG,a man from the east coast,"[1, 1]","This film truly disappoints, and here's why:  it could have been truly great.  The premise is wonderful.  A mafia bodyguard spends years watching over the daughter of his boss, falls in love with her from afar, and then the boss is killed ... and the only way to continue to protect her is to reveal his identity to her.  As the plot continues, she must depend upon him more and more for her survival, thus appealing to the better angels of his nature.  What better catayst to propel the plot than his protective instincts to feed the fires of his love?Sounds great, doesn't it?  Well, it didn't turn out that way.  Not even close.The problem is, the aforementioned plot treatment is not funny.  Not even in the slightest.  This could have been -- and really should have been -- a touching love story with a bit of comic relief, and that would have worked beautifully.  Instead, this film is not even remotely funny, although it tries to be.  The scenes that were obviously intended to be ROTFLMAO screamers fell absolutely flat.To me, Stallone seems to play two characters in this film.  One was the loyal bodyguard falling in love with his boss' daughter, the other was a good actor going through the motions of a script he clearly finds uninspiring.  There are a few scenes in the film where Stallone shows his tender, engaging side, and several in which he just can't seem to find anything within himself to bring to this poorly developed screenplay.  It is clear throughout the film that Stallone WANTS to be inspired by this screenplay, but how?  Ay, there's the rub.I don't really blame Stallone, or even the lovely Ms. Stowe, for this film's ultimate demise.  I blame the writers.  A good idea for a film does not a great movie make.A good plot will grow in a particular direction, seemingly of its own accord, like a plant leaning towards the sunlight for its nourishment.  This film needed to grow into a poignant love story, and a dramatic format, or perhaps even a tragic storyline, would have served the premise far better than did a comedic treatment.  The screenwriters tried to force the plot of this film to be something that it wasn't, which is a recipe for disaster.  This film should have been a drama, not a comedy.  I just can't say that enough.To the writers:  Remember, a good plot wants to achieve something.  If you insist on making this a comedy, remember that every good comic play wants to accomplish a mission.  ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World"" showed the truly destructive nature of human greed, and ""Ghostbusters"" presented mere mortals defeating the forces of death.  Comedy is really quite serious, guys.  Freud said that ""All laughter is supressed anger"".  Remember that.  What is the point that this film seeks to achieve?  To mock or satirize the mafia?  To show the foolishness of falling in love with someone out of reach?  To say that love conquers all?  This film had no message or point whatsoever.  A comedy must have a theme, just like a tragedy or a romance.  ""Avenging Angelo""'s plot was only skin-deep.  One can not sink one's teeth into something hollow and pointless.To Stallone:  You are a fine actor and writer.  You can pick better writers than these.  Why not find some college guy who wants to make a name for himself?  You could even hold a contest in the English departments of universities across the country.  ""Write My Next Movie"", the flyers would read.  Anything to find some writers with fresh ideas true to their artistic intergrity.On a brief side note, this was Anthony Quinn's last film, and his talent and charm provide one of the very few bright spots in  this movie.  His greatness as a performer is unrivaled, and yet even the goldmine of talent offered by Mr. Quinn was not fully excavated by the writers.  He and Stallone could have been great together, as were Stallone and DeNiro in ""Copland"", or Stallone and Burgess in ""Rocky"".  (Warning!  My next comment is a plot-spoiler.)  The event that ruined Anthony Quinn's role in this film was when Stallone steps outside to talk to a cop, whilst Mr. Quinn is left behind in a restaurant, vulnerable and unprotected.  We then see a couple of goofy, completely unbelieveable hitmen move in for the kill.  It is painfully obvious to me that no mafia bodyguard would EVER have done something so stupid ... unless he was a conspirator in the attempt to whack his boss.  Such an oversight shows disloyalty in ""La Cosa Nostra"", which is exactly the opposite of the relationship these writers intended to develop.In the future, I hope Stallone will start to take a more ""Rambo-ish"" take-no-prisoners attitude when it comes to insisting upon quality writing in his movies.  He is a fine writer himself, as he demonstrates most capably in ""Rocky"" I and II, and the original ""First Blood"".  My expectation is that a man with Stallone's literary abilities would have ""Rambo'ed"" these writers into putting forth a screenplay worthy of both this fine plot idea and Mr. Stallone's largely untapped dramatic ability.Every once in a long while, Stallone shows us what he can really accomplish.  I do get frustrated with the long wait between his truly fine dramatic accomplishments, like ""Copland"" and ""Rocky"".  This film could have been great if it had been a romance, or even better, a tragic romance.  It just didn't work as a comedy, and if anything, it seems to stunt Stallone's acting abilities, rather than encourage them.",2,"What could, should, and would have been a good movie if

Which is all the more tragic, as this was the last film Anthony Quinn made, being released a few months after his death. Quinn, of course, left us a great legacy of more than 100 roles, with films like ""Zorba the Greek"" (1961), ""Lust for Life"" (1956), ""Viva Zapata"" (1952), and ""Wild is the Wind"" (1957). He was nominated for an Oscar 4 times, winning twice for Best Supporting Actor.Madeline Stowe plays Sandra Bullock and not only adopts her speech and mannerisms, but manages to look like her twin sister. Of course, there's nothing wrong with Sandra Bullock, but an actress of Madeline Stowe's stature can afford to be herself. Stowe has given us great performances in films such as ""Last of the Mohicans"" (1992), ""Short Cuts"" (1993), and ""China Moon"" (1994). My personal preference is her work in ""Twelve Monkeys"" (1995).The one good thing about this film is Sylvester Stallone's performance. Stallone needs no introduction. His ""Rocky"" and ""Rambo"" films are film icons, although most of his other films have been forgettable, apart from his sensitive portrayal of the overweight cop wannbe in ""Copland"" (1997).The film is OK and even has a certain charm, but one has to wonder.

747424,A25RN8X70DSZLU,B00008UALG,JRP,"[0, 0]","This is my final review for the month of August & this is 2002 in film Avenging Angelo. I got this in a 3 pack with Shade & Eye See You. I only got it for Eye See You. This movie came out around the time in between Copland & Rocky VI which was a real down period for Slyvester Stallone. When he was doing movies like this & Spy Kids 3. This movie is very very boring & it's attempts at humor doesn't work. The movie lies the discription makes it sound like it's going to be a bad a  s  s here's what the discription is Frankie Delano a tough as nails bodygaurd has to protect a Mafia Bosses Daughter from being the next hit. It sounds like the movie is going to fire on all cylinders. What we get is a romance comedy that happens to involve the mob. Avenging Angelo was directed by Marytn Burke he directed Pirates Of Silicon Valley which that was a good movie. It stars Slyvester Stallone as Frankie Delano, Madeleine Stowe as Jenifer, Anthony Quinn as Angelo Alliegheri & Raoul Bova as Marcello. The story is Franki Delano is a Bodygaurd for Mob Boss named Angelo Alliegheri this rival mob wants him dead so you have this guy named Bruno kill him. Then your introduced to this chick named Jenifer who is so annoying & I can't stress that enough. She acts like a goof a  s  s. She is into these books written by this guy named Marcello. When she goes home she finds her Husband cheating on her with 1 of her friends. I honestly felt like I was watching a movie made for Life Time. Madeline Stowe's acting wasn't bad in We Were Soldiers she was great. In fact that was 1 of my favorites in 2002. You have Frankie come in play this DVD of Angelo telling Jenifer that he is her father. Jenifer goes out shopping Frankie follows her to The Mall & some hit man tries to kill her Frankie gets her down to saftey no shoot out no fight with Stallone & the hit man nothing. I know I'll get a comment saying that this is a comedy. I'm sorry but the poster & DVD artwork make it look like it's going to be a movie where Stallone has to protect this woman & he's going to war with The Mob. As a comedy it is not funny & when a comedy is not funny it fails. Skipping ahead Jenifer decides to kill the person that is after her Tucio Malatista her cigarette smoke causes him to have a heart attack. He is taken off on an ambulance they take her along The Mob forces her to Marry Tucio Malatista & he wants to have s  3  x she causes him to have another 1 & die. So she doesn't need Frankie anymore so she is dating Marcello. That guy Bruno shows up at her house Frankie's there reading 1 of Jenifer's chick books. He asks if Bruno ever read this book. He says ""It insaults my intellgence & insaults my ignorance."" Stallone says ""It's a killer."" He fires the gun bullet goes through the book & straight for his head. Cool scene & that's it. Jenifer is visiting Italy with Marcello  & she tells him that she is The Daughter of Angelo Alliegieri. Then Marcello tells her that he's really a guy named Gianni Carbon & it really gets confusing basically he tries to kill her but Frankie shows up Stallone has a lame fight with Raoul Bova. Then he tells Jenifer his feelings for her they get Married & have a family & WOW this was an awful movie. A comedy that isn't funny with DVD & poster artwork that makes it look like an action movie. A 98 minute movie that feels like a slow burn. Marytn Burke did a bad & I mean bad job directing . Sylvester Stallone was decent but that's it. Madeline Stowe was annoying & I didn't care aboout her character. Raoul Bova was terrible just like in AvP. Anthony Quinn did fine shame that this was his last role.

747428,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B00008UALG,Lee Armstrong,"[17, 17]","""Avenging Angelo"" is a fairly good movie, but one I enjoyed despite its shortcomings.  It will forever be remembered as the last film of Anthony Quinn's long and illustrious career.  Quinn does a good job of playing the mobster with a heart.  Sylvester Stallone looks great & has enough puppy dog eyes directed at Madeleine Stowe to charm the coldest of hearts.  Stowe as Jennifer does a good job at giving reality to her rich girl with a rocky marriage character.  The give and take between she and Stallone keeps the romantic aspect alive.  Italian actor Raoul Bova does a good job as the pseudo-writer who charms Jennifer.  I'm not sure if it's Harry Van Gorkum or Kip Barrett who played the husband, but he did a great job of being irritating.  My favorite moment is when the drugged Jennifer crashes the car in the driveway, only to find her husband making whoopee in the pool with her best friend.  This was apparently Martyn Burke's first feature directing job.  He had previously written the screenplay for ""Gross Anatomy"" starring Matthew Modine.  The difficulty with the flick is the pull between the romance and the mafia hits.  There is humor in the film, kind of a feature-length ""Sopranos.""  For its shortcomings, this is still a pleasant evening's entertainment.  Of course, you'll want to see Anthony Quinn one last time.

Angelo does not want to admit this, but he comes to this realization gradually and definitely.  Stallone's grim resolve throughout the movie and devil-may-care attitude is rather refreshing.  Gone is the aloof hitman, but an involved bodyguard.  Stallone plays it well, and Madeline Stowe portrayal of his former boss' daughter is also laced with humor and sensuality at the same time.

747442,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00008UALG,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","Listen this. Sylvester Stallone plays a professional watcher/bodyguard for a married woman Madeleine Stowe, and he gradually falls in love with her. Sounds familiar? Yet unlike Kevin and Whitney's mega-hit film, &quot;Avenging Angelo&quot; has been given different sides to the story -- One, it's supposed to be comedy (or comedy-like thriller ... whatever); Two, it's Anthony Quinn's last film. Sorry, but these two extra values couldn't save the film from its being absolutely forgettable.The story is so familiar that you don't need any more introduction, except that Stowe's character Jeniffer is a daughter of a mobster, Quinn's Angelo, who is gunned down in a restaurant. So, as you know, Frankie thinks that this is his fault (and it is), and swears to the dying man that he will protect his daughter no matter what it takes.So far, good. I mean, not original, but could be a starting point for good action, thriller, or even comedy. Actually, &quot;Avenging Angelo&quot; doesn't know what it really wants to be. As comedy, it is too slack and lazy; as thriller, too slow; and as action, ... did I see any actions in here? Sorry, but cannot remember any.Some say Sly's acting is bad. I disagree. He is not as bad as you might think. The truth is, he retains certain amount of charisma and presence, but the awful film just squanders it.And talking about awful, Maleleine Stowe's over-the-top acting as mentally unstable woman is awfulness itself. Look how she appears first, and you will know it. She sticks her legs and head out of the roof of a running car, yelling and shouting something about her son, as if saying it is funny. If your friends, learning English, ask you what &quot;embarrassing&quot; means, show the scene. They would understand immediately.And it is Quinn's last film. I personally do not like him much, but I know he deserves a better film (and better lines to say when his character falls). But Chaplin's last film was also awful, so let's forget this one, and see his old Felini film instead.",2,Anthony Quinn's Last Film; He (& Sly) Deserve a Better One,1090368000,"07 21, 2004",2004,2024,"['Listen', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'professional', 'watcher/bodyguard', 'married', 'woman', 'Madeleine', 'Stowe', 'gradually', 'love', 'familiar', 'Kevin', 'Whitney', 'mega-hit', 'film', 'quot', 'Avenging', 'Angelo', 'quot', 'been', 'given', 'different', 'sides', 'story', 'One', 'supposed', 'be', 'comedy', 'comedy-like', 'thriller', 'Two', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'last', 'film', 'Sorry', 'two', 'extra', 'values', 'could', ""n't"", 'save', 'film', 'being', 'absolutely', 'forgettable.The', 'story', 'so', 'familiar', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'more', 'introduction', 'Stowe', 'character', 'Jeniffer', 'daughter', 'mobster', 'Quinn', 'Angelo', 'who', 'gunned', 'down', 'restaurant', 'So', 'know', 'Frankie', 'fault', 'swears', 'dying', 'man', 'will', 'protect', 'daughter', 'matter', 'what', 'takes.So', 'far', 'good', 'mean', 'not', 'original', 'could', 'be', 'starting', 'point', 'good', 'action', 'thriller', 'even', 'comedy', 'Actually', 'quot', 'Avenging', 'Angelo', 'quot', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'really', 'be', 'comedy', 'too', 'slack', 'lazy', 'thriller', 'too', 'slow', 'action', 'did', 'see', 'actions', 'here', 'Sorry', 'can', 'not', 'remember', 'any.Some', 'say', 'Sly', 'acting', 'bad', 'disagree', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'might', 'think', 'truth', 'certain', 'amount', 'charisma', 'presence', 'awful', 'film', 'just', 'squanders', 'it.And', 'talking', 'awful', 'Maleleine', 'Stowe', 'over-the-top', 'acting', 'mentally', 'unstable', 'woman', 'awfulness', 'Look', 'how', 'first', 'will', 'know', 'legs', 'head', 'roof', 'running', 'car', 'yelling', 'shouting', 'something', 'son', 'saying', 'funny', 'friends', 'learning', 'English', 'ask', 'what', 'quot', 'embarrassing', 'quot', 'show', 'scene', 'would', 'understand', 'immediately.And', 'Quinn', 'last', 'film', 'personally', 'do', 'not', 'much', 'know', 'better', 'film', 'better', 'lines', 'say', 'when', 'character', 'Chaplin', 'last', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'awful', 'let', 'forget', 'one', 'see', 'old', 'Felini', 'film', 'instead']",N/A

747446,AP3B615GM191G,B00008UALG,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 0]","When reviewing ""Avenging Angelo"", there really are only about two avenues down which a reviewer can proceed. The first choice is to say that it is a terrible film, devoid of any semblance of plot or point, and filled with stupid little puns and jokes that really aren't all that funny. If you would take this approach, you would probably be backed by most of the American population, as this film never actually made it to cinemas and ended up a ""straight-to-DVD"" production.Yet, for viewers of ""Angelo"" familiar with Sylvester Stallone's ""unique"" brand of humor, this will be one of the most entertaining (if not all that important) films you ever watch. As a fan of Stallone, I have sat viewed the good (Rocky, Rambo), the bad (Demolition Man, The Specialist), and the ugly (Stop or My Mom Will Shoot!, Shade), and this film fits none of those categories as it is so unique.The basic plot centers on Stallone's character, Frankie, trying to avenge the death of his ""beloved mob boss"" Angelo (played by Anthony Quinn in his final role ever before his death). To do so, Frankie vows to protect Angelo's daughter Jennifer (Madeleine Stowe) from the mob scene, but (in predictable fashion) begins to fall in love with her, and (slowly) she with him.Unfortunately, besides some decent chemistry between Stallone and Stowe, the plot completely fails on pretty much all accounts (it isn't compelling, it doesn't lead anywhere, etc.), thus the likely reason it never went to theaters. In fact, the crucial opening scenes between Frankie and Angelo need subtitles in order to understand, as Quinn's voice is so raspy. Basically, the plot is a complete and utter failure.Why the four-star rating then? If you have ever seen Sly Stallone on TV appearances (Letterman, Leno, etc.), you know that his ""brand"" of humor is far different than most actors. Sly will tell a stupid joke (""pooping machine with hooves"") or make a ridiculous statement (""snip ropes""), get absolutely no response, yet continue on as if he were Robin Williams or Jim Carrey, providing the REAL humor of the situation. That EXACT same type of humor is played up to its fullest in this movie, and is a complete hoot! Whether it be stuffing a burglar into a wheelbarrow, ""farting squirrels"" in the walls, or Sly telling Jennifer's boyfriend to ""reconsider"" before fighting him, you (if a fan of Stallone) will be one the floor laughing.So if you have 90 minutes to spare, are a fan of Sylvester Stallone, and would like to lighten your mood a bit, this film will be perfect for you. There's no plot to worry about, no high-action to dazzle you, just a good old fashion ""bad"" movie that is hilarious for that exact reason.",4,"Need To Understand ""Stallone Humor"" To Like This Movie At All",1249516800,"08 6, 2009",2009,2680,"['When', 'reviewing', 'Avenging', 'Angelo', 'really', 'are', 'only', 'about', 'two', 'avenues', 'down', 'reviewer', 'can', 'proceed', 'first', 'choice', 'say', 'terrible', 'film', 'devoid', 'semblance', 'plot', 'point', 'filled', 'stupid', 'little', 'puns', 'jokes', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'funny', 'would', 'take', 'approach', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'backed', 'most', 'American', 'population', 'film', 'never', 'actually', 'made', 'cinemas', 'ended', 'up', 'straight-to-DVD', 'production.Yet', 'viewers', 'Angelo', 'familiar', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'unique', 'brand', 'humor', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'entertaining', 'not', 'important', 'films', 'ever', 'watch', 'fan', 'Stallone', 'have', 'sat', 'good', 'Rocky', 'Rambo', 'bad', 'Demolition', 'Man', 'Specialist', 'ugly', 'Stop', 'My', 'Mom', 'Will', 'Shoot', 'Shade', 'film', 'none', 'categories', 'so', 'unique.The', 'basic', 'plot', 'centers', 'Stallone', 'character', 'Frankie', 'trying', 'avenge', 'death', 'beloved', 'mob', 'boss', 'Angelo', 'played', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'final', 'role', 'ever', 'death', 'do', 'so', 'Frankie', 'protect', 'Angelo', 'daughter', 'Jennifer', 'Madeleine', 'Stowe', 'mob', 'scene', 'predictable', 'fashion', 'fall', 'love', 'slowly', 'him.Unfortunately', 'decent', 'chemistry', 'Stallone', 'Stowe', 'plot', 'completely', 'pretty', 'much', 'accounts', ""n't"", 'compelling', ""n't"", 'lead', 'anywhere', 'etc', 'thus', 'likely', 'reason', 'never', 'went', 'theaters', 'fact', 'crucial', 'opening', 'scenes', 'Frankie', 'Angelo', 'need', 'subtitles', 'order', 'understand', 'Quinn', 'voice', 'so', 'raspy', 'Basically', 'plot', 'complete', 'utter', 'failure.Why', 'four-star', 'rating', 'then', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Sly', 'Stallone', 'TV', 'appearances', 'Letterman', 'Leno', 'etc', 'know', 'brand', 'humor', 'far', 'different', 'most', 'actors', 'Sly', 'will', 'tell', 'stupid', 'joke', 'pooping', 'machine', 'hooves', 'make', 'ridiculous', 'statement', 'snip', 'ropes', 'get', 'absolutely', 'response', 'yet', 'continue', 'were', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'providing', 'REAL', 'humor', 'situation', 'EXACT', 'same', 'type', 'humor', 'played', 'up', 'fullest', 'movie', 'complete', 'hoot', 'be', 'stuffing', 'burglar', 'wheelbarrow', 'farting', 'squirrels', 'walls', 'Sly', 'telling', 'Jennifer', 'boyfriend', 'reconsider', 'fighting', 'fan', 'Stallone', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'floor', 'laughing.So', 'have', '90', 'minutes', 'spare', 'are', 'fan', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'would', 'like', 'lighten', 'mood', 'bit', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'perfect', 'plot', 'worry', 'about', 'high-action', 'dazzle', 'just', 'good', 'old', 'fashion', 'bad', 'movie', 'hilarious', 'exact', 'reason']",N/A

In order to completely enjoy ""Avenging Angelo"", you need to be able to understand ""Stallone humor.""""Avenging Angelo"" is about the daughter of ex Italian mobster Angelo Allieghieri. (Anthony Quinn) However, his daughter Jennifer Barrett does not even know he is her father, because Angelo does not want his enemies to get to her. Angelo has a bodyguard named Frankie Delano. (Stallone) As they are eating out, Frankie gets distracted by a police officer writing him a ticket. While Frankie is outside, one of Angelo's enemies kills him. Earlier in the film Angelo says ""if anything happens to me, you've gotta keep doing what your doing for me"" meaning when he is gone, Angelo wants Frankie to be Jennifer's bodyguard. After Angelo's death, Frankie tries to explain to Jennifer that Angelo Allieghieri is her real father.Throught the rest of the film there are some great scenes between Stallone and Stowe.Overall, Avenging Angelo is very enjoyable film if you like/understand Stallone's style of comedy. ""Avenging Angelo"" is that it is not purely a comedy film.
