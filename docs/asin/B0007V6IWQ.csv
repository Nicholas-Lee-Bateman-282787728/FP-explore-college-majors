891695,A2FVE6V3YTFIDO,B0007V6IWQ,"Amazon Customer ""Glen""","[16, 17]","It only took until their 35th anniversary for Sony to loosen the locks on their vault to finally present one of the best TV sitcoms to come out of the seventies! The Partridge Family was a money making phenomenon and it makes me wonder why the Sony execs have taken so long to bring this show out of seclusion. Due to extremely high syndication rights, this show has only seen limited airplay on classic television, much to the dismay of its fans. Well, now the time is here to ""C'mon Get Happy!"" once again. This set features 25 episodes of the first season, including the series pilot which captured the nation by storm!Starring Oscar nominated actress/singer Shirley Jones and her real life stepson, 70s pop icon David Cassidy, the show focuses on the exploits of a single widowed mom and her five children who tour the country in a Mondrian painted school bus and play their hearts out for audiences from Caesars Palace to local night clubs. Rounding out the cast is fifteen year old activist/feminist, Laurie (played wonderfully by NY model Susan Dey), 10 year old finanacial mogel, Danny (played to the tee by comedic genius Danny Bonaduce) and seven year old Chris (them played by Jeremy Gelbwaks later replaced by Brian Forster) and tamborene banging, five year old Tracy (played by Suzanne Crough). As a kid, I loved this group and was disappointed to learn they didn't really sing. But the songs and stories were quite good and funny and they won me over! Despite comments by ney-sayers, the stories were fun, solid and actually quite well written. The family was not perfect by the standards of their fore-runners and actually fought and argued and played pranks on each other, but in the end, there was a solid family foundation of love and togetherness sadly lacking in today's television. Each episode revolved around a song which most critics sighed that were moralistic and tied in with the story, but then again, isn't that what song writers do? Write about life experiences? I think people fought too hard against this show. In it's simplisticness, it is funny, touching and extremely enjoyable and addictive. 35 years later, I still enjoy David Madden's dead pan exasperation as the Partridge's harried manager, Reuben Kincaid as he realzes once again, he has been foiled by Danny Partridge. Filled with guest stars making their television debut are the likes of Jackyn Smith, Farrah Fawcett, Lou Gossett Jr, Richard Pryor, Bobby Sherman and many more. The first year of Partridges follow their exploits on the road whereas subsequent seasons show them more at home. This does not fail the show in any way, however, yet makes the freshness and newness of the magical first season stand out above the rest.As to the production value, to the trained eye, some DVD enthusiasts may say these were not cleaned up but whereas the show was safely locked away there is little to complain about. The colors are beautiful, the picture and sound quality are excellent. Extras include two episodes of Hanna Barbera's Partridge Family 2200 A.D. featuring voice overs by Susan Dey, Danny Bonaduce, Suzanne Crough and Brian Forster. Plus a bonus sampler CD disc from ""C'mon Get Happy: The Very Best Of The Partridge Family"" by Arista, plus features ""Jump To Musical Performances"" also two short documentries featuring David Cassidy, Shirley Jones and Danny Bonaduce and one about the music of the Partridges. Although short in length, the documentaries are fun to watch. Overall, a great package and a great price! Worth EVERY penny of the purchase price to view these in order!!! Thanks Sony for finally providing me with a time capsule to teleport me back to my favorite childhood years! Bring on Season Two, three and four and blow us away with the extras!!!!",5,Climb Back on the Bus For the Ride Of Your Life!,1115683200,"05 10, 2005",2005,3766,"['only', 'took', '35th', 'anniversary', 'Sony', 'loosen', 'locks', 'vault', 'finally', 'present', 'one', 'best', 'TV', 'sitcoms', 'come', 'seventies', 'Partridge', 'Family', 'was', 'money', 'making', 'phenomenon', 'wonder', 'why', 'Sony', 'execs', 'have', 'taken', 'so', 'long', 'bring', 'show', 'seclusion', 'Due', 'extremely', 'high', 'syndication', 'rights', 'show', 'only', 'seen', 'limited', 'airplay', 'classic', 'television', 'much', 'dismay', 'fans', 'Well', 'now', 'time', 'here', ""C'mon"", 'Get', 'Happy', 'once', 'again', 'set', '25', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'including', 'series', 'pilot', 'captured', 'nation', 'storm', 'Starring', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'actress/singer', 'Shirley', 'Jones', 'real', 'life', 'stepson', '70s', 'pop', 'icon', 'David', 'Cassidy', 'show', 'exploits', 'single', 'widowed', 'mom', 'five', 'children', 'who', 'tour', 'country', 'Mondrian', 'painted', 'school', 'bus', 'play', 'hearts', 'out', 'audiences', 'Caesars', 'Palace', 'local', 'night', 'clubs', 'Rounding', 'out', 'cast', 'fifteen', 'year', 'old', 'activist/feminist', 'Laurie', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'NY', 'model', 'Susan', 'Dey', '10', 'year', 'old', 'finanacial', 'mogel', 'Danny', 'played', 'tee', 'comedic', 'genius', 'Danny', 'Bonaduce', 'seven', 'year', 'old', 'Chris', 'played', 'Jeremy', 'Gelbwaks', 'later', 'replaced', 'Brian', 'Forster', 'tamborene', 'banging', 'five', 'year', 'old', 'Tracy', 'played', 'Suzanne', 'Crough', 'kid', 'loved', 'group', 'was', 'disappointed', 'learn', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'sing', 'songs', 'stories', 'were', 'quite', 'good', 'funny', 'won', 'over', 'comments', 'ney-sayers', 'stories', 'were', 'fun', 'solid', 'actually', 'quite', 'well', 'written', 'family', 'was', 'not', 'perfect', 'standards', 'fore-runners', 'actually', 'fought', 'argued', 'played', 'pranks', 'other', 'end', 'was', 'solid', 'family', 'foundation', 'love', 'togetherness', 'sadly', 'lacking', 'today', 'television', 'episode', 'revolved', 'song', 'most', 'critics', 'sighed', 'were', 'moralistic', 'tied', 'story', 'then', 'again', ""n't"", 'what', 'song', 'writers', 'do', 'Write', 'life', 'experiences', 'think', 'people', 'fought', 'too', 'hard', 'show', 'simplisticness', 'funny', 'touching', 'extremely', 'enjoyable', 'addictive', '35', 'years', 'later', 'still', 'enjoy', 'David', 'Madden', 'dead', 'pan', 'exasperation', 'Partridge', 'harried', 'manager', 'Reuben', 'Kincaid', 'once', 'again', 'been', 'foiled', 'Danny', 'Partridge', 'Filled', 'guest', 'stars', 'making', 'television', 'debut', 'are', 'likes', 'Jackyn', 'Smith', 'Farrah', 'Fawcett', 'Lou', 'Gossett', 'Jr', 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'Bobby', 'Sherman', 'many', 'more', 'first', 'year', 'Partridges', 'follow', 'exploits', 'road', 'whereas', 'subsequent', 'seasons', 'show', 'more', 'home', 'not', 'fail', 'show', 'way', 'however', 'yet', 'freshness', 'newness', 'magical', 'first', 'season', 'stand', 'out', 'rest.As', 'production', 'value', 'trained', 'eye', 'DVD', 'enthusiasts', 'may', 'say', 'were', 'not', 'cleaned', 'up', 'show', 'was', 'safely', 'locked', 'away', 'little', 'complain', 'colors', 'are', 'beautiful', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'excellent', 'Extras', 'include', 'two', 'episodes', 'Hanna', 'Barbera', 'Partridge', 'Family', '2200', 'A.D.', 'featuring', 'voice', 'overs', 'Susan', 'Dey', 'Danny', 'Bonaduce', 'Suzanne', 'Crough', 'Brian', 'Forster', 'bonus', 'sampler', 'CD', 'disc', ""C'mon"", 'Get', 'Happy', 'Very', 'Best', 'Partridge', 'Family', 'Arista', 'Jump', 'Musical', 'Performances', 'also', 'two', 'short', 'documentries', 'featuring', 'David', 'Cassidy', 'Shirley', 'Jones', 'Danny', 'Bonaduce', 'one', 'music', 'Partridges', 'short', 'length', 'documentaries', 'are', 'fun', 'watch', 'Overall', 'great', 'package', 'great', 'price', 'Worth', 'EVERY', 'penny', 'purchase', 'price', 'view', 'order', 'Thanks', 'Sony', 'finally', 'providing', 'time', 'capsule', 'teleport', 'back', 'favorite', 'childhood', 'years', 'Bring', 'Season', 'Two', 'three', 'four', 'blow', 'away', 'extras']",The Partridge Family - The Complete First Season

Watching it on DVD brought back some great memories and made me smile. I even remember liking the songs. Eeek! Don't tell anyone.......However, while I was okay with the picture quality considering the show's age, I was not impressed with the compression of so many episodes on 1 disc. Some of the episodes jumped which became very frustrating. (it's not my player- I have a high quality player)I also experienced this same problem with The Brady Bunch- Season 1. Too many episodes on 1 disc!!!On the Partridge Family set, I could have done without the CD sampler. I'll buy the greatest hits if I want to listen to the music. Besides, there is a ""jump to musical selections"" on the DVD menu.I know the executives are looking to keep costs down but please don't compromise the quality! I think I'd rather spend a few more bucks for more discs or if they can use the double-sided discs, that might make it a little better.I really wished they listened to the people buying these sets once in a while!",4,Great release but too many shows per disc,1116201600,"05 16, 2005",2005,1078,"['have', 'fond', 'memories', 'Patridge', 'Family', 'having', 'watched', '9', 'year', 'old', 'Watching', 'DVD', 'brought', 'back', 'great', 'memories', 'made', 'smile', 'even', 'remember', 'liking', 'songs', 'Eeek', 'Do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'anyone', '.However', 'was', 'okay', 'picture', 'quality', 'considering', 'show', 'age', 'was', 'not', 'impressed', 'compression', 'so', 'many', 'episodes', '1', 'disc', 'episodes', 'jumped', 'became', 'very', 'frustrating', 'not', 'player-', 'have', 'high', 'quality', 'player', 'also', 'experienced', 'same', 'problem', 'Brady', 'Bunch-', 'Season', '1', 'Too', 'many', 'episodes', '1', 'disc', 'Partridge', 'Family', 'set', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'CD', 'sampler', ""'ll"", 'buy', 'greatest', 'hits', 'want', 'listen', 'music', 'jump', 'musical', 'selections', 'DVD', 'menu.I', 'know', 'executives', 'are', 'looking', 'keep', 'costs', 'down', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'compromise', 'quality', 'think', ""'d"", 'rather', 'spend', 'few', 'more', 'bucks', 'more', 'discs', 'can', 'use', 'double-sided', 'discs', 'might', 'make', 'little', 'better.I', 'really', 'wished', 'listened', 'people', 'buying', 'sets', 'once', 'while']",The Partridge Family - The Complete First Season

891698,A1YB29BIDULEYE,B0007V6IWQ,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[1, 1]","This review is dedicated to the wonderful Farrah Fawcett. Thank you for your guest appearance in this dvd set.Well, I'm not the biggest ""Partridge Family"" fan. So, other reviewers could probably give a better review. But that said, I enjoyed this dvd set even though it was a little before my time.If you are on this site, you probably already know that this show is about a widowed mother who joins her son Keith's band. (And of course the band of her 2 other sons, and her 2 daughters.)While Keith runs the group, the child who often steals the show is the (impossibly smart for a 10 year old) Danny. As the 'often frustrated' Reuben says: ""I keep thinking I'm talking with a 40 year old midget.""Very quickly, Reuben is hilarious as the often frustrated, but still loyal manager. (Who kind of doubles as a likable father figure in the absence of Shirley's husband.)(D1) The pilot episode is well done; watch for an appearance by the wonderful Farrah Fawcett in 'The Sound of Money.' 'Private Partridge' is silly, but funny. 'But the Memory Lingers On' is also silly, but funny.(D2) A little more serious, Danny feels he wrecked a show in: 'Did You Hear the One ABout Danny Partridge?' 'This Is My Song' has kind of a sadness to it. 'My Son the Feminist' has a decent story about going too far. 'Star Quality' has a sad lesson about what can happen when you single someone out rather than just complimenting the whole group. 'Mom Drops Out' is possibly the BEST episode in that Shirley is lead to believe she is too old to stay with the group; but the children defend her the best they can; and we see the fans REALLY WANT Shirley back.(D3) 'A Partridge Up A Pear Tree' has a HILARIOUS episode where big spender Keith must borrow money from RICH Danny and even sign 'financial control agreements.' 'Road Song' is a great episdoe where the P Family gets mixed up with a teenage runaway, and Reuben suggests running away to Mexico is a pretty good option.I should also say this dvd set includes 2 bonus animated episodes. One where Danny borrows Keith's car; and where Danny tries to convince his mother he made a 'space ball team.'Overall, it's a nice dvd package.It's wonderful to see a family perform together like this, but I think the most touching thing here is that we see that there IS LIFE after trauma. (In this case the death of Shirley Jone's husband, and how she goes on in a new direction.)It's a nice way to have a 70s night.",4,Good For a 70s Night,1302825600,"04 15, 2011",2011,2439,"['review', 'dedicated', 'wonderful', 'Farrah', 'Fawcett', 'Thank', 'guest', 'appearance', 'dvd', 'set.Well', ""'m"", 'not', 'biggest', 'Partridge', 'Family', 'fan', 'So', 'other', 'reviewers', 'could', 'probably', 'give', 'better', 'review', 'said', 'enjoyed', 'dvd', 'set', 'even', 'was', 'little', 'time.If', 'are', 'site', 'probably', 'already', 'know', 'show', 'widowed', 'mother', 'who', 'son', 'Keith', 'band', 'course', 'band', '2', 'other', 'sons', '2', 'daughters', 'Keith', 'group', 'child', 'who', 'often', 'show', 'impossibly', 'smart', '10', 'year', 'old', 'Danny', ""'often"", 'frustrated', 'Reuben', 'keep', 'thinking', ""'m"", 'talking', '40', 'year', 'old', 'midget', 'Very', 'quickly', 'Reuben', 'hilarious', 'often', 'frustrated', 'still', 'loyal', 'manager', 'Who', 'kind', 'doubles', 'likable', 'father', 'figure', 'absence', 'Shirley', 'husband', 'D1', 'pilot', 'episode', 'well', 'done', 'watch', 'appearance', 'wonderful', 'Farrah', 'Fawcett', ""'The"", 'Sound', 'Money', ""'Private"", 'Partridge', 'silly', 'funny', ""'But"", 'Memory', 'Lingers', 'also', 'silly', 'funny', 'D2', 'little', 'more', 'serious', 'Danny', 'wrecked', 'show', ""'Did"", 'Hear', 'One', 'Danny', 'Partridge', ""'This"", 'My', 'Song', 'kind', 'sadness', 'Son', 'Feminist', 'decent', 'story', 'going', 'too', 'far', 'Quality', 'sad', 'lesson', 'what', 'can', 'happen', 'when', 'single', 'someone', 'rather', 'just', 'complimenting', 'whole', 'group', 'Out', 'possibly', 'BEST', 'episode', 'Shirley', 'lead', 'believe', 'too', 'old', 'stay', 'group', 'children', 'defend', 'best', 'can', 'see', 'fans', 'REALLY', 'WANT', 'Shirley', 'back', 'D3', 'Partridge', 'Up', 'Pear', 'Tree', 'HILARIOUS', 'episode', 'where', 'big', 'spender', 'Keith', 'must', 'borrow', 'money', 'RICH', 'Danny', 'even', 'sign', ""'financial"", 'control', 'agreements', ""'Road"", 'Song', 'great', 'episdoe', 'where', 'P', 'Family', 'mixed', 'up', 'teenage', 'runaway', 'Reuben', 'running', 'away', 'Mexico', 'pretty', 'good', 'option.I', 'should', 'also', 'say', 'dvd', 'set', '2', 'bonus', 'animated', 'episodes', 'One', 'where', 'Danny', 'Keith', 'car', 'where', 'Danny', 'convince', 'mother', 'made', ""'space"", 'ball', 'team', ""'Overall"", 'nice', 'dvd', 'package.It', 'wonderful', 'see', 'family', 'perform', 'together', 'think', 'most', 'touching', 'thing', 'here', 'see', 'IS', 'LIFE', 'trauma', 'case', 'death', 'Shirley', 'Jone', 'husband', 'how', 'new', 'direction', 'nice', 'way', 'have', '70s', 'night']",The Partridge Family - The Complete First Season
891699,A3N8RZSXKN1OR2,B0007V6IWQ,Chrijeff,"[0, 0]","The five Partridge kids of San Pueblo, CA, are musically gifted.  Keith (David Cassidy), 17, writes music and lyrics, sings, and plays lead guitar; Laurie (Susan Dey), about 14, ""has a social conscience,"" sings, and plays keyboards; Danny (Danny Bonaduce), the best financial and legal mind you'll find in a 10-year-old body, plays bass and sings; Chris (Jeremy Gelbwaks) is a drummer (and a baseball nut); and Tracy (Suzanne Crough), who's five, ""has perfect pitch and plays tambourine.""  It's natural that they should have started a garage band.  And when their father dies suddenly and their mother (Shirley Jones, in real life Cassidy's stepmother) has to go to work full-time, they're determined ""to help her if our music would pay.""  So Danny borrows some high-end recording equipment from his school, and when the girl they've lined up as a vocalist comes down with the mumps they persuade their mom to stand in.  The sound that results is surprisingly good, and Danny, who won't take no for an answer, manages to get it heard by the excitable Reuben Kincaid (Dave Madden), who reluctantly signs on as the family's manager--and lo and behold, they're a hit!Based loosely on the real ""family band"" the Cowsills, the series follows the Partridges at home, in school, and on the road as they try to adjust to their sudden celebrity.  This was one of the last true ""family"" sitcoms (in the '70's the genre was changing over to the Norman Lear model that gave rise to the silly, scatological, or ""relevant"" comedies of today): funny yet gentle, relevant yet unpretentious, and helped by the very attractive and wholesome family that serves as its focus.  Some of the episodes arise from situations any family might encounter (Shirley's dad, retired plumber Fred Renfrew (Ray Bolger), suffers a later-than-midlife crisis and wants to join the group, much to the dismay of his wife Amanda (Rosemary DeCamp); Shirley encounters an old guyfriend and the kids fear it's serious; Laurie gets braces and suffers terribly from self-consciousness; Keith buys an ancient Hudson, but the expenses are so high he can't afford to take his girlfriend anywhere; Danny becomes convinced he was adopted; Keith gets overprotective wgen Laurie dates a reputed high-school Lothario); others from their status as pop idols (Reuben gets engaged, but his fiancee doesn't want him travelling with the family; Shirley wonders if ""life on the road"" is really good for the kids; Keith tries to cope with hometown groupies while struggling to gain the attention of the one girl (played by Lane Bradbury, who, as the hill girl Merry Florene, threw herself at Newly O'Brien for several seasons on ""Gunsmoke"") who won't give him a look) or from the '70's time period (Keith's new (liberationist) girlfriend tries to get the family to appear at a rally, and a morality-watchdog parents' group gets involved; a computer foulup results in Danny receiving a draft notice).  Among the guest stars are Harry Morgan (as a malingerer who tries to sue the Partridges for supposed whiplash injuries after he bumps their bus), Jackie Coogan, Morey Amsterdam, Stuart Margolin (as a convict at a minimum-security facility), then-unknown Farrah Fawcett and Jaclyn Smith, Mark Hamill (with light brown hair), Richard Pryor, and Lou Gossett.  The music is on the same innocent order as that of the early Beach Boys, focusing mostly on young-teen love, and is nicely done, though mostly by uncredited artists (Jones began in movie musicals and has a very respectable voice, as does Cassidy, who performs to this day).  Baby-boomer parents will enjoy this look back to the days of their youth, and while today's kids may find the Partridges a bit hokey, that may be all the better reason to get to know them.  This set also includes two episodes from the concurrent Hanna-Barbera cartoon series ""Partridge Family--2220 AD"" (which used several of the original voice talents) and a CD of tracks from the new collection of Partridge standards.",4,I think I love them,1292371200,"12 15, 2010",2010,3993,"['five', 'Partridge', 'kids', 'San', 'Pueblo', 'CA', 'are', 'musically', 'gifted', 'Keith', 'David', 'Cassidy', '17', 'music', 'lyrics', 'sings', 'plays', 'lead', 'guitar', 'Laurie', 'Susan', 'Dey', 'about', '14', 'social', 'conscience', 'sings', 'keyboards', 'Danny', 'Danny', 'Bonaduce', 'best', 'financial', 'legal', 'mind', ""'ll"", 'find', '10-year-old', 'body', 'bass', 'sings', 'Chris', 'Jeremy', 'Gelbwaks', 'drummer', 'baseball', 'nut', 'Tracy', 'Suzanne', 'Crough', 'who', 'five', 'perfect', 'pitch', 'plays', 'tambourine', 'natural', 'should', 'have', 'started', 'garage', 'band', 'when', 'father', 'suddenly', 'mother', 'Shirley', 'Jones', 'real', 'life', 'Cassidy', 'stepmother', 'go', 'work', 'full-time', ""'re"", 'determined', 'help', 'music', 'would', 'pay', 'Danny', 'high-end', 'recording', 'equipment', 'school', 'when', 'girl', ""'ve"", 'lined', 'up', 'vocalist', 'down', 'mumps', 'persuade', 'mom', 'stand', 'sound', 'results', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'Danny', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'take', 'answer', 'get', 'heard', 'excitable', 'Reuben', 'Kincaid', 'Dave', 'Madden', 'who', 'reluctantly', 'signs', 'family', 'manager', 'lo', 'behold', ""'re"", 'hit', 'Based', 'loosely', 'real', 'family', 'band', 'Cowsills', 'series', 'Partridges', 'home', 'school', 'road', 'try', 'adjust', 'sudden', 'celebrity', 'was', 'one', 'last', 'true', 'family', 'sitcoms', ""'70"", 'genre', 'was', 'changing', 'Norman', 'Lear', 'model', 'gave', 'rise', 'silly', 'scatological', 'relevant', 'comedies', 'today', 'funny', 'yet', 'gentle', 'relevant', 'yet', 'unpretentious', 'helped', 'very', 'attractive', 'wholesome', 'family', 'focus', 'episodes', 'arise', 'situations', 'family', 'might', 'encounter', 'Shirley', 'dad', 'retired', 'plumber', 'Fred', 'Renfrew', 'Ray', 'Bolger', 'later-than-midlife', 'crisis', 'join', 'group', 'much', 'dismay', 'wife', 'Amanda', 'Rosemary', 'DeCamp', 'Shirley', 'old', 'guyfriend', 'kids', 'fear', 'serious', 'Laurie', 'braces', 'suffers', 'terribly', 'self-consciousness', 'Keith', 'ancient', 'Hudson', 'expenses', 'are', 'so', 'high', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'take', 'girlfriend', 'anywhere', 'Danny', 'convinced', 'was', 'adopted', 'Keith', 'overprotective', 'wgen', 'Laurie', 'reputed', 'high-school', 'Lothario', 'others', 'status', 'pop', 'idols', 'Reuben', 'engaged', 'fiancee', ""n't"", 'want', 'travelling', 'family', 'Shirley', 'wonders', 'life', 'road', 'really', 'good', 'kids', 'Keith', 'cope', 'hometown', 'groupies', 'struggling', 'gain', 'attention', 'one', 'girl', 'played', 'Lane', 'Bradbury', 'who', 'hill', 'girl', 'Merry', 'Florene', 'threw', 'Newly', ""O'Brien"", 'several', 'seasons', 'Gunsmoke', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'look', ""'70"", 'time', 'period', 'Keith', 'new', 'liberationist', 'girlfriend', 'tries', 'get', 'family', 'appear', 'rally', 'morality-watchdog', 'parents', 'group', 'involved', 'computer', 'foulup', 'results', 'Danny', 'receiving', 'draft', 'notice', 'guest', 'stars', 'are', 'Harry', 'Morgan', 'malingerer', 'who', 'sue', 'Partridges', 'supposed', 'whiplash', 'injuries', 'bumps', 'bus', 'Jackie', 'Coogan', 'Morey', 'Amsterdam', 'Stuart', 'Margolin', 'convict', 'minimum-security', 'facility', 'then-unknown', 'Farrah', 'Fawcett', 'Jaclyn', 'Smith', 'Mark', 'Hamill', 'light', 'brown', 'hair', 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'Lou', 'Gossett', 'music', 'same', 'innocent', 'order', 'early', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'focusing', 'mostly', 'young-teen', 'love', 'nicely', 'done', 'though', 'mostly', 'uncredited', 'artists', 'Jones', 'began', 'movie', 'musicals', 'very', 'respectable', 'voice', 'Cassidy', 'who', 'day', 'Baby-boomer', 'parents', 'will', 'enjoy', 'look', 'back', 'days', 'youth', 'today', 'kids', 'may', 'find', 'Partridges', 'bit', 'hokey', 'may', 'be', 'better', 'reason', 'get', 'know', 'set', 'also', 'two', 'episodes', 'concurrent', 'Hanna-Barbera', 'cartoon', 'series', 'Partridge', 'Family', '2220', 'AD', 'used', 'several', 'original', 'voice', 'talents', 'CD', 'tracks', 'new', 'collection', 'Partridge', 'standards']",The Partridge Family - The Complete First Season

891710,A3GI22GLBVBGC2,B0007V6IWQ,Dusty,"[5, 6]","Wow! Having watched only the first two DVD's of Season 1 so far over the past week, I had to stop by here and mention how thrilling it is to see The Partridge Family again! Sure, we all know the show itself was great. But this DVD set also comes loaded with some great extra features. For the price I just don't see how any Partridge Family fan could say no.I don't remember The Partridge Family meaning so much to me when the show originally aired, when I was quite young. Except that I'm pretty sure Susan Dey was my first crush (and I instantly remembered why while watching episode one!).There is so much I'd forgotten about this show--Danny's precociousness, Mr. Kinkaid's furrowed brow, that crazy bus, the hilariously awful lip-synching, and something I never noticed when I was just a kid: Shirley Jones looks pretty fine in a mini-skirt!And of course, when the show originally aired, I didn't realize who guest stars like Farrah Fawcet, Jaclyn Smith, and Mark Hamill were (or would later become, to be precise). What a great surprise to see these up-and-coming stars, along with established greats like Ray Bolger (The Wizard of Oz's ""Scarecrow"") and Jackie Coogan (The Addam's Family's ""Uncle Fester"").The special features are a mixed bag. There's an excellent documentary describing how the show came to be, including recent interviews with some cast members. There's also a brief documentary showing the men and women who actually made the music. I've always thought David Cassidy had a fabulous voice, so it was funny to learn that no one even bothered to hear him sing before he was cast as Keith Partridge. Some episodes have commentaries by Danny Bonneduce and Shirley Jones that, while fairly short of talk and inside information, are still a gas to listen to. There's also a sampler CD of four classic Partridge Family songs. It's a rather blatant marketing tool for the greatest hits CD, but I already have the CD, so it was a genuine bonus for me.Overall, this is just plain a fun ride. In my opinion, The Partridge Family was superior to The Brady Bunch because it was always upbeat (The Brady's could get so depressing with their guilt and shame sometimes). Like the ""Cheers"" theme song, the Partridge Family theme really sums up what the show was all about: Come On, Get Happy!The only negative thing I'd say is shame, Shame, SHAME on Sony for replacing the original ding-a-ling-a-ling episode ending with their own lame logo and ""music"". That sound was completely associated with this show in my mind after so many viewings as a kid, and Sony's idiotic decision to replace it may ruin that memory for me forever. Why can't these arrogant corporations leave the classics alone? I can only hope Sony will restore the original ding-a-ling thing in upcoming season sets.",5,"Come On, Get Happy -- Get This DVD!",1123459200,"08 8, 2005",2005,2790,"['Wow', 'Having', 'watched', 'only', 'first', 'two', 'DVD', 'Season', '1', 'so', 'far', 'past', 'week', 'had', 'stop', 'here', 'mention', 'how', 'thrilling', 'see', 'Partridge', 'Family', 'again', 'Sure', 'know', 'show', 'was', 'great', 'DVD', 'set', 'also', 'loaded', 'great', 'extra', 'features', 'price', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'Partridge', 'Family', 'fan', 'could', 'say', 'no.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'Partridge', 'Family', 'meaning', 'so', 'much', 'when', 'show', 'originally', 'aired', 'when', 'was', 'quite', 'young', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'Susan', 'Dey', 'was', 'first', 'crush', 'instantly', 'remembered', 'why', 'watching', 'episode', 'one', 'so', 'much', ""'d"", 'forgotten', 'show', 'Danny', 'precociousness', 'Mr.', 'Kinkaid', 'furrowed', 'brow', 'crazy', 'bus', 'hilariously', 'awful', 'lip-synching', 'something', 'never', 'noticed', 'when', 'was', 'just', 'kid', 'Shirley', 'Jones', 'pretty', 'fine', 'mini-skirt', 'course', 'when', 'show', 'originally', 'aired', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'who', 'guest', 'stars', 'Farrah', 'Fawcet', 'Jaclyn', 'Smith', 'Mark', 'Hamill', 'were', 'would', 'later', 'become', 'be', 'precise', 'What', 'great', 'surprise', 'see', 'up-and-coming', 'stars', 'established', 'greats', 'Ray', 'Bolger', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'Scarecrow', 'Jackie', 'Coogan', 'Addam', 'Family', 'Uncle', 'Fester', '.The', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'mixed', 'bag', 'excellent', 'documentary', 'describing', 'how', 'show', 'came', 'be', 'including', 'recent', 'interviews', 'cast', 'members', 'also', 'brief', 'documentary', 'showing', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'actually', 'made', 'music', ""'ve"", 'always', 'thought', 'David', 'Cassidy', 'had', 'fabulous', 'voice', 'was', 'funny', 'learn', 'one', 'even', 'bothered', 'hear', 'sing', 'was', 'cast', 'Keith', 'Partridge', 'episodes', 'have', 'commentaries', 'Danny', 'Bonneduce', 'Shirley', 'Jones', 'fairly', 'short', 'talk', 'inside', 'information', 'are', 'still', 'gas', 'listen', 'also', 'sampler', 'CD', 'four', 'classic', 'Partridge', 'Family', 'songs', 'rather', 'blatant', 'marketing', 'tool', 'greatest', 'hits', 'CD', 'already', 'have', 'CD', 'was', 'genuine', 'bonus', 'me.Overall', 'just', 'plain', 'fun', 'ride', 'opinion', 'Partridge', 'Family', 'was', 'superior', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'was', 'always', 'upbeat', 'Brady', 'could', 'get', 'so', 'depressing', 'guilt', 'shame', 'sometimes', 'Cheers', 'theme', 'song', 'Partridge', 'Family', 'theme', 'really', 'sums', 'up', 'what', 'show', 'was', 'Come', 'Get', 'Happy', 'only', 'negative', 'thing', ""'d"", 'say', 'shame', 'Shame', 'SHAME', 'Sony', 'replacing', 'original', 'ding-a-ling-a-ling', 'episode', 'ending', 'own', 'lame', 'logo', 'music', 'sound', 'was', 'completely', 'associated', 'show', 'mind', 'so', 'many', 'viewings', 'kid', 'Sony', 'idiotic', 'decision', 'replace', 'may', 'ruin', 'memory', 'forever', 'Why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'arrogant', 'corporations', 'leave', 'classics', 'alone', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'Sony', 'will', 'restore', 'original', 'ding-a-ling', 'thing', 'upcoming', 'season', 'sets']",The Partridge Family - The Complete First Season

Part of that is because in the first season of the Brady's, the kids were very, very small and the classic episodes didn't happen until they grew up a bit, whereas the Partridge's are of varying ages (smart, smart move) and they're mobile.  They're on the go all the time, they sing, they have fun adventures and Shirley Jones is perfect as the pretty, hip mom.  Plus, the show is very, very funny.  Danny Bonaduce and Dave Madden (as Reuben Kincaid) are perfectly matched for one another and Bonaduce always has a good line.  Sure, some of the episodes haven't aged well, but don't let that hamper your enjoyment; every episode is still worth seeing.

Sandwiched in between 'The Brady Bunch' and 'Love, American Style,' you just didn't do much else when the weekend hit (not that there were many options available when you were nine(!)).  I've always thought the first season of 'The Partridge Family' was the best - the first wave of 'Partridgemania' for us little kids, the wonderful music, and the sheer innocent fun of the show.  Personally, I think the color transfers are great on the DVD (much better than my Columbia House PF videos that are available) and several of the extra features are fun.  It's always great to listen to people like Shirley Jones, David Cassidy and Danny Bonaduce look back fondly on what must have been a wonderful experience.  Hopefully, by the issuance of the second season, we'll be able to hear memories from Brian Forster, Suzanne Crough...and, hopefully, Dave Madden?  My understanding is that Susan Dey, sad to say, still refuses to give interviews about her Partridge experiences.Apart from the episodes themselves, it's great to hear interviews with the Bahler brothers, Jackie Ward, Michael Melvoin and Bernard Slade (Wes Farrell has since passed on) on the vital roles they played in the development of the musical style and the production of the show.  These are folks who haven't been given as much credit as they deserve; it's nice that they are featured in this set.  All in all, everybody involved with this classic television show can be proud of their achievement.

891728,A2HIBAJEMRFX3W,B0007V6IWQ,"Michael Rogers ""Mego73""","[100, 105]","The first thing that must be said after watching these shows (in full for the first time)is that I was impressed with the writing. Keeping in mind that it was a sitcom, the writing is pretty sharp, much sharper than The Brady Bunch.Look fast, not only for the ""Before they were famous"" pop ups of people like Farrah Fawcett, Louis Gossitt Junior(with hair!), Richard Pryor and others but for the houses. The Partridge family lives on the ""street"" with the houses from ""Bewitched"", ""I Dream Of Jeannie"", ""Hazel"" and others.You even see Keith Partridge drop off a date of his in front of the ""Bewitched"" house. Reusing these house facades was done over and over again in Screen Gems shows. It's fun to pick them out.The shows are nicely cleaned up and sharp but fall short when it comes to the color.On most shows, the color is not as rich as I'd expect from other releases of late 60's, early 70's color shows (which were made to showcase color TV which was newer and more expensive). Most properly done DVD releases of color shows of this era have a rich technicolor sheen (like The Brady Bunch, Star Trek and Here's Lucy).Here, it looks like the color was dialed back a bit. While this doesn't make it an inferior transfer, it makes it less reflective of the time it was shown. The biggest effect of this is the lack of color in the skin tones. Where most shows of this period show skin tones looking pretty rich and colorful, on this DVD they are subdued.The mono sound is fine and represents the soundtrack well.The set loses a bit on the restoring of ephemeral bits that probabaly weren't seen since the original airings. Both Hogan's Heroes and Brady Bunch releases restored the opening ""In Color"" bumpers to beginnings of all the shows. I wish it was also done for PF.Also, someone else mentioned that the original ""Screen Gems"" logo was delteted at the end as well (although I never found it scary). My memory of the yellow/orange background Screen Gems logo is inseperably tied to shows like Partridge Family, Bewitched, Gidget, I Dream Of Jeannie and others. Replacing it with the new Sony logo is jarring (just as it was jarring to have the SG logo replaced with Columbia Tristar before in syndication and tapes). It's a little thing but to buy a vintage show on DVD is to hope they get the little details like that right.And yes, one show is edited. I know that even though I'm no PF expert. Shows of this time were expected to run at least 25 minutes sans commercials. The final episode of the season runs a bit over 23 minutes and is missing the tag. The least you should expect from purchasing shows on DVD is for the shows to be unedited. This appears to be an oversight so maybe it will be corrected.The extras include featurettes and commentary and do thier part of giving little known details on the show. The best is a feature on the musicians that ""augmented"" the Partridge Family.I have to admit the most fun extra was the couple bonus episodes of the Animated spin off ""Partridge Family 2200 AD"". As a fan of the good, bad and the ugly of 1970's Saturday Morning TV I loved seeing this. I never saw this when it was originally on (must of been busy watching Bugs Bunny) but it is a hoot. It looks like an excuse for Hanna Barbara to use the Partridge Family name and to reuse a lot of thier ""The Jetsons"" backgrounds. The writing is awful, of course, but so familiar to creatures of 1970's Saturday Morning that it works despite itself.Note to DVD makers, do this whenever possible.

The show was very different the first year with the band on the road and the shows' centered around young Danny and Mr. Kincades' antics more.The show became a big hit and because David Cassidy was a huge part of that, they started to write more lines for Keith. Keith and Danny were very funny together, but unfortunately the show became a ""living room"" comedy in the following years. The DVD transfer is not bad, but there is some room for improvement.The extras are cool with a featurette on the casting and one on the sound and music of the group. There is an episode of the short lived cartoon 'The Partridge Family 2200 A.D.' which is hilarious to see now!

The show is charmingly retro, looks great, audio quality is great, and the silly costumes can't hide the fact that Shirley Partridge is the hottest mom you ever saw (next to my wife of course).As someone who prefers that reissues not reinvent history I was glad that the first season theme song ""When We're Singing"" (which has the same melody as ""C'mon Get Happy"") was left intact. This is the theme song I remember.So far I've only viewed the first two episodes but what a kick recognizing Harry Morgan (M*A*S*H) and a very young Farrah Fawcett in episode two. And the first episode, the man in black himself, Johnny Cash! The shows may be standard sitcom fare but what makes them unique is that you can play these DVDs with the kids around, no predictable double entendres, no tacky wisecracks, no characters trying to impress us with how ""edgy"" they are.Although pre-order buzz suggested that a number of unreleased songs would be included on a bonus CD, what you get is a four song promotional CD for the companion ""greatest hits"" audio CD. Includes three of the most popular tracks from the first Partridge Family album as well as ""C'mon Get Happy"". Whole bonus audio CD clocks in at about ten minutes in length.Well, maybe the absence of rarities is not a bad thing after all. The two unreleased songs from the pilot episode are only ""Partridge Family songs"" because they appear in the show but they don't have the Partridge sound and all vocals are handled by a faceless studio chorus. Worse yet, these two songs, ""Together (Having A Ball)"" and ""Let The Good Times In"", sound like they came from the same people who recorded generic songs for the Scooby Doo cartoons. The only notable thing about these two throwaways is that Neil Sedaka gets a writing credit on the latter song. As my wife came in I found myself embarrassed and explaining, ""this isn't the Partridge Family singing in the first episode, they didn't know David Cassidy could sing yet.""With a price point like this there's bound to be some cut corners somewhere. In this case you get no accompanying booklet or sleeve with the DVD, just case and disks. If you're curious what songs are associated with which episode, or other details that you might expect with a DVD set, you'll just have to watch the shows or use the ""jump to the songs"" feature.Seeing as the Partridge Family's music continued charting in the top 40 throughout the second season perhaps a Season Two DVD set will appear in six months. If that happens hopefully the final disk of that set will be an audio compilation of all the unreleased songs from seasons one and two.

The scripts were good and the characters played off each other well.  The series was really Cassidy, Jones, Dey, Bonaduce and Dave Madden (Ruben Kincaid).

891738,AMZYAGVDQWTS,B0007V6IWQ,Reviews No More,"[4, 5]","You know why the Partridge Family is a good show?  Because the Brady Bunch makes this family look like a love-in.  Sure, this show had its saccharine and unbelievable moments, but you can forgive them next to Marsha Brady's ""oh my nose!"" episode.  Usually, this show is quite believable in the family's music business predicaments, and also the writing is quite good.Danny Bonaduce and Dave Madden had great chemistry as a comedy team, but they were also quite close off the set of the show as well.  The two youngest kids are cute, if stiff, as actors, Susan Dey was good as budding teenage feminist Laurie, and Shirley Jones has always been a pleasure in most any venture she's undertaken.  Must I really mention that, just like every other little girl and teenager back in the early 70's, I had a crush on David Cassidy?  I was also at the right age to develop a crush on younger brother Shaun a few years later.If you grew up with this show like I did and wish they'd run it on cable somewhere, this box set should be quite pleasing.  My favorite episodes, to name a few, are the pilot, the incident with the skunk, and when Laurie gets braces.  After all these years, I can admit the songs aren't so bad either.Extras include music performances, interviews, two episodes of the short-lived Saturday morning cartoon, and Shirley Jones commenting on one of the best episodes.  The Partridge family is 25 episodes, and then some, of good clean fun for the entire family with a lesson generally involved.

All family members get groovy crushed velvet vests, and go on tour as a rock and roll band with a Mondarin-themed school bus.Manager Ruben Kincaid (Dave Madden) is always booking the group in 'small' joints, despite their 'megahit' status in the series---which should actually have them headlining the big venues. This 'small' booking is supposed to be part of the band's/show's charm. They are rock stars, but they are also a suburban family.The Partridges are rock stars who get mobbed by screaming girls--- but this family also goes shopping in the local supermarket and the kids attend area public schools just like many other early 1970's suburbanites. The Patridges also still live in the same house before their band instead of moving off to a mansion which would have more accurately reflected their new earning power.A neat series factoid is that Jones was actually David Cassidy's real-life step mom, but neither of them knew that the other had read for this series until they were cast. Both Jones and Cassidy got along in real life and during the series run. Cassidy of course played eldest son and lead singer Keith Partridge.I like eldest daughter Laurie Partridge (Susan Dey) who balances this rock and roll career with activist tendencies, including the emergent women's movement. She is actively involved with the local (fictional) Power Of Womanhood group and tries to call her brothers on their sexist behavior in several episodes.In ""My son the feminist"" Laurie is amused when older brother Keith Partridge attempts to convince one of HER friends that he shares the same politics---when actually he is only trying to get her to date him and could really care less about performing at a feminist political rally. Throughout the season, Laurie makes observations that her oldest brothers (including Danny Partridge) do not share simmilar social convictions.One thing this 'family' shares is the lip-synching. Although Jones could actually sing, and Cassidy eventually launched an offscreen singing career from his Partridge Family stint, the other cast members could not cary a tune to save their own lives. The voices heard during 'performances' and on the albums are actually studio musicians.DVD extras are a feature which can 'jump' you directly to the song being played in each episode and episodes from the tie-in cartoon 'The Partridge Family 2200 A.D'. That Hanna Barbera cartoon had the Partridge Family playing music in a Jetsons-like future, AND can actually boast of some original 'family members' doing voicework for their characters.Even though this DVD release only offers 3 discs, I like that many of the extras are spread out over two discs instead of having been crammed onto one dic.",5,Get happy with Season One of the Partridge Family,1109030400,"02 22, 2005",2005,3237,"['Partridge', 'Family', 'was', 'sitcom', 'capitalized', 'counterculture-bubblegum', 'scaring', 'off', 'middle', 'America.Because', ""'family"", 'show', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'group', 'trashing', 'hotel', 'rooms', 'doing', 'other', 'shennanigans', 'am', 'certain', 'are', 'rock', 'roll', 'roadtrip', 'staples', 'Even', ""'ladies"", 'man', 'lead', 'singer', 'Keith', 'Partridge', 'David', 'Cassidy', 'very', 'chaste.Season', 'One', '1970-1971', '25', 'episodes', 'how', 'group', 'was', 'formed', 'Single', 'mom', 'Shirley', 'Partridge', 'Shirley', 'Jones', 'had', 'feed', 'family', 'somehow', 'family', 'members', 'get', 'groovy', 'crushed', 'velvet', 'vests', 'go', 'tour', 'rock', 'roll', 'band', 'Mondarin-themed', 'school', 'bus.Manager', 'Ruben', 'Kincaid', 'Dave', 'Madden', 'always', 'booking', 'group', ""'small"", 'joints', ""'megahit"", 'status', 'series', '-which', 'should', 'actually', 'have', 'headlining', 'big', 'venues', ""'small"", 'booking', 'supposed', 'be', 'part', ""band's/show"", 'charm', 'are', 'rock', 'stars', 'are', 'also', 'suburban', 'family.The', 'Partridges', 'are', 'rock', 'stars', 'who', 'get', 'mobbed', 'screaming', 'girls', 'family', 'also', 'shopping', 'local', 'supermarket', 'kids', 'attend', 'area', 'public', 'schools', 'just', 'many', 'other', 'early', '1970', 'suburbanites', 'Patridges', 'also', 'still', 'live', 'same', 'house', 'band', 'instead', 'moving', 'off', 'mansion', 'would', 'have', 'more', 'accurately', 'reflected', 'new', 'earning', 'power.A', 'neat', 'series', 'factoid', 'Jones', 'was', 'actually', 'David', 'Cassidy', 'real-life', 'step', 'mom', 'knew', 'other', 'had', 'read', 'series', 'were', 'cast', 'Jones', 'Cassidy', 'got', 'along', 'real', 'life', 'series', 'run', 'Cassidy', 'course', 'played', 'eldest', 'son', 'lead', 'singer', 'Keith', 'Partridge.I', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'Laurie', 'Partridge', 'Susan', 'Dey', 'who', 'rock', 'roll', 'career', 'activist', 'tendencies', 'including', 'emergent', 'women', 'movement', 'actively', 'involved', 'local', 'fictional', 'Power', 'Womanhood', 'group', 'call', 'brothers', 'sexist', 'behavior', 'several', 'episodes.In', 'son', 'feminist', 'Laurie', 'amused', 'when', 'older', 'brother', 'Keith', 'Partridge', 'attempts', 'convince', 'one', 'HER', 'friends', 'shares', 'same', 'politics', '-when', 'actually', 'only', 'trying', 'get', 'date', 'could', 'really', 'care', 'less', 'performing', 'feminist', 'political', 'rally', 'season', 'Laurie', 'observations', 'oldest', 'brothers', 'including', 'Danny', 'Partridge', 'do', 'not', 'share', 'simmilar', 'social', 'convictions.One', 'thing', 'shares', 'lip-synching', 'Jones', 'could', 'actually', 'sing', 'Cassidy', 'eventually', 'launched', 'offscreen', 'singing', 'career', 'Partridge', 'Family', 'stint', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'could', 'not', 'cary', 'tune', 'save', 'own', 'lives', 'voices', 'heard', ""'performances"", 'albums', 'are', 'actually', 'studio', 'musicians.DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'feature', 'can', ""'jump"", 'directly', 'song', 'being', 'played', 'episode', 'episodes', 'tie-in', 'cartoon', 'Partridge', 'Family', '2200', 'A.D', 'Hanna', 'Barbera', 'cartoon', 'had', 'Partridge', 'Family', 'playing', 'music', 'Jetsons-like', 'future', 'can', 'actually', 'boast', 'original', ""'family"", 'members', 'doing', 'voicework', 'characters.Even', 'DVD', 'release', 'only', '3', 'discs', 'like', 'many', 'extras', 'are', 'spread', 'out', 'two', 'discs', 'instead', 'having', 'been', 'crammed', 'one', 'dic']",The Partridge Family - The Complete First Season

891741,A178LLZ84A2JB5,B0007V6IWQ,"S. Spears ""Artwomyn""","[0, 0]","The Partridge Family premiered in 1970. Sure, it was sort of corny. But most TV shows back then were. It was a more innocent era then, and so was television. It revolved around the misadventures of a squeaky-clean, middle-class family, who decided to form a band and make records. It was based on the real-life rock-n-roll family, the Cowsills. David Cassidy, who was a teen heart-throb on the show, played the eldest brother, Keith Partridge. Laurie Partridge, played by Susan Dey, was his cover-girl-pretty younger sibling, and tended to annoy Keith on a frequent basis. His other siblings were cute, precocious-types, especially Danny Partridge (who was the 10-year-old financial wizard).The family was headed by widow, and cool mom, Shirley Partridge (played by David Cassidy's real-life step-mom, Shirley Jones). The cast was rounded-out by their hapless Manager, Reuben Kincaid (played by rubber-faced comic Dave Madden), who always made a perfect comic-foil for Danny. The whole family sang and played instruments. They cut several albums during the course of the series, that spawned some hit singles. Their songs to me, were really quite good, especially if you like soft-rock and love ballads.I could identify with the Partridge's suburban life-style, having grown-up in a solid middle-American, middle-class suburb myself. Some of the kids on the show were my age, and some were the same ages as my own siblings.This show came on ABC on Friday night, following another family sitcom with several kids, the Brady Bunch. The Partridge Family even had many episodes that were so similar to some Brady Bunch episodes, they could only be called shameless rip-offs. Still, it was a gentle, family-oriented show, with good music and good acting by the cast. I always looked forward to Friday nights back then, just so I could enjoy the Partridge Family on TV.",5,One of the best 70s sitcoms.,1262044800,"12 29, 2009",2009,1863,"['Partridge', 'Family', 'premiered', '1970', 'Sure', 'was', 'sort', 'corny', 'most', 'TV', 'shows', 'back', 'then', 'were', 'was', 'more', 'innocent', 'era', 'then', 'so', 'was', 'television', 'revolved', 'misadventures', 'squeaky-clean', 'middle-class', 'family', 'who', 'decided', 'form', 'band', 'make', 'records', 'was', 'based', 'real-life', 'rock-n-roll', 'family', 'Cowsills', 'David', 'Cassidy', 'who', 'was', 'teen', 'heart-throb', 'show', 'played', 'eldest', 'brother', 'Keith', 'Partridge', 'Laurie', 'Partridge', 'played', 'Susan', 'Dey', 'was', 'cover-girl-pretty', 'younger', 'sibling', 'tended', 'annoy', 'Keith', 'frequent', 'basis', 'other', 'siblings', 'were', 'cute', 'precocious-types', 'especially', 'Danny', 'Partridge', 'who', 'was', '10-year-old', 'financial', 'wizard', '.The', 'family', 'was', 'headed', 'widow', 'cool', 'mom', 'Shirley', 'Partridge', 'played', 'David', 'Cassidy', 'real-life', 'step-mom', 'Shirley', 'Jones', 'cast', 'was', 'rounded-out', 'hapless', 'Manager', 'Reuben', 'Kincaid', 'played', 'rubber-faced', 'comic', 'Dave', 'Madden', 'who', 'always', 'made', 'perfect', 'comic-foil', 'Danny', 'whole', 'family', 'sang', 'played', 'instruments', 'cut', 'several', 'albums', 'course', 'series', 'spawned', 'hit', 'singles', 'songs', 'were', 'really', 'quite', 'good', 'especially', 'like', 'soft-rock', 'love', 'ballads.I', 'could', 'identify', 'Partridge', 'suburban', 'life-style', 'having', 'grown-up', 'solid', 'middle-American', 'middle-class', 'suburb', 'kids', 'show', 'were', 'age', 'were', 'same', 'ages', 'own', 'siblings.This', 'show', 'came', 'ABC', 'Friday', 'night', 'following', 'family', 'sitcom', 'several', 'kids', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'Partridge', 'Family', 'even', 'had', 'many', 'episodes', 'were', 'so', 'similar', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'episodes', 'could', 'only', 'be', 'called', 'shameless', 'rip-offs', 'Still', 'was', 'gentle', 'family-oriented', 'show', 'good', 'music', 'good', 'acting', 'cast', 'always', 'looked', 'forward', 'Friday', 'nights', 'back', 'then', 'just', 'so', 'could', 'enjoy', 'Partridge', 'Family', 'TV']",The Partridge Family - The Complete First Season

With apologies to the actors playing Chris and Tracy, the enjoyment of the show comes heavily from the interactions of its five leads:  Mom Shirley, Handsome but flaky Keith, Passionate Laurie, Conniving but adorable Danny, and their rumpled manager, Reuben Kincaid.  In sitcom world it is no secret that the storylines are often excuses for the characters to create interesting chemistry, and, when casting is well-done, these character relationships can keep an otherwise vacuous series on the air for years.  It was, then, a very happy stroke of luck that brought this crew together.  Nowadays, the oft-repeated stories of how this series was cast leave one to wonder that it came together at all.  And yet, it did, and you find yourself not only liking this group of people, but thinking it would be nice to know someone like them.  Need I forget, one must also mention the music.  Dismissed as ""bubble-gum"" pop by folks of that era (not to mention today!) the music was a major player, as many of the episodes were created solely for the purpose of backing up one song or another (most notably ""Point Me in the Direction of Albuquerque"").  In other words, if you don't like the music, you are sunk.  The reality is, however, many of us do like the music ... a lot.  Yes, hundreds of us busy professionals with our families and our complex lives in the post 9/11 world actually enjoy pulling down the blinds late at night and secretly cranking up ""I Think I Love You"" or ""Come On, Get Happy"" just to put a smile on our face.  Try it - you might be pleasantly surprised at how good you feel when you listen to music which is actually upbeat.  Speaking of which, the DVD set (short on extras but with a neat ""jump to the song"" feature) should lose a point due to lame commentary.  I know it's a clich&eacute;, but producers need to realize that good commentary is worth its weight in gold and bad commentary - well it just puts a bad taste in your mouth to waste your time.  The talented and sweet Shirley Jones does one episode, but mostly just giggles and ""mmm-hmms"" throughout.  Danny Bonaduce does one episode and resorts to his now trademark humor, which is to say, more than a step over the line of mean (""Hey, that's something you'll never see, Susan Dey eating!"").  Ditch the commentary and just watch the episodes.

Perhaps it was because it didn't get as much rerun airtime as Lucy or the Bradys, but I see now the real reason; the show was absymal was so it didn't enjoy a long shelf life.I've been buying as many of this ""era sets"" as I can get a hold of, many are good, some are even great, and some are a ""surprise"". So, a gamble is sometimes all you have and it works both ways. Leave it to Beaver was a definite welcome surprise, Land of the Lost was not. The Partridge Family is not.The acting is so painful to watch. The scripts are so lousy (Ten year old Danny gets drafted!?). The music is so grating (and I LIKE the Brady music). The guest stars are equally terrible (the grandfather/grandmother). I really cannot for the life of me figure out how a show like THIS lives on. Are people really this thick? It really makes me question television in general. I mean if this ISN'T bad television then WHAT IS!??Here's what I did like about it; the opening credits and song is very nostalgic, Reuben Kincaid and Danny's chemistry, and the fact that David Cassidy and Susan Dey look like brother and sister. That's IT! And out of 25 epsiodes that ain't much.",1,Shockingly terrible,1137456000,"01 17, 2006",2006,1269,"['Being', 'born', ""'68"", 'sometimes', 'have', 'rely', 'reruns', 'memories', 'sake', 'even', 'still', 'show', 'was', 'VERY', 'distant', 'memory', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'as', 'much', 'rerun', 'airtime', 'Lucy', 'Bradys', 'see', 'now', 'real', 'reason', 'show', 'was', 'absymal', 'was', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'long', 'shelf', 'life.I', ""'ve"", 'been', 'buying', 'many', 'era', 'sets', 'can', 'get', 'hold', 'many', 'are', 'good', 'are', 'even', 'great', 'are', 'surprise', 'So', 'gamble', 'sometimes', 'all', 'have', 'ways', 'Leave', 'Beaver', 'was', 'definite', 'welcome', 'surprise', 'Land', 'Lost', 'was', 'not', 'Partridge', 'Family', 'not.The', 'acting', 'so', 'painful', 'watch', 'scripts', 'are', 'so', 'lousy', 'Ten', 'year', 'old', 'Danny', 'drafted', 'music', 'so', 'grating', 'LIKE', 'Brady', 'music', 'guest', 'stars', 'are', 'equally', 'terrible', 'grandfather/grandmother', 'really', 'can', 'not', 'life', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'show', 'THIS', 'Are', 'people', 'really', 'thick', 'really', 'question', 'television', 'general', 'mean', ""N'T"", 'bad', 'television', 'then', 'WHAT', 'Here', 'what', 'did', 'like', 'opening', 'credits', 'song', 'very', 'nostalgic', 'Reuben', 'Kincaid', 'Danny', 'chemistry', 'fact', 'David', 'Cassidy', 'Susan', 'Dey', 'look', 'brother', 'sister', 'IT', '25', 'epsiodes', 'ai', ""n't"", 'much']",The Partridge Family - The Complete First Season
