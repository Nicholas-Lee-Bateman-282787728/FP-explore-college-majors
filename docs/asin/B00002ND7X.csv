515156,A1RPJHUVVSI98A,B00002ND7X,Justin Opinion,"[2, 2]","This concert DVD is no longer being manufactured (out of print, as it were), and that is a terrible shame. This video captures Natalie Merchant at what I consider to be her prime. Filmed in a broadway theatre in NYC, the concert is wonderfully shot. No silly effects or odd camera angles - just a great edit of a nicely filmed and beautifully performed show.This film captures Ms. Merchant in great voice, with the full catalog of her best work at her disposal. Her personality onstage comes shining through as well. She is very interactive with her audience and her sincerity as a person and performer is evident. Today's self-proclaimed ""divas"" should watch this concert film to get an idea what genuine talent looks and sounds like.This needs to be re-issued! Perhaps on Blu-ray with some additional footage, etc.",5,No longer available... what a shame!!,1285632000,"09 28, 2010",2010,816,"['concert', 'DVD', 'no', 'longer', 'being', 'manufactured', 'print', 'were', 'terrible', 'shame', 'video', 'Natalie', 'Merchant', 'what', 'consider', 'be', 'prime', 'Filmed', 'broadway', 'theatre', 'NYC', 'concert', 'wonderfully', 'shot', 'silly', 'effects', 'odd', 'camera', 'just', 'great', 'edit', 'nicely', 'filmed', 'beautifully', 'performed', 'show.This', 'film', 'captures', 'Ms', 'Merchant', 'great', 'voice', 'full', 'catalog', 'best', 'work', 'disposal', 'personality', 'onstage', 'shining', 'as', 'well', 'very', 'interactive', 'audience', 'sincerity', 'person', 'performer', 'evident', 'Today', 'self-proclaimed', 'divas', 'should', 'watch', 'concert', 'film', 'get', 'idea', 'what', 'genuine', 'talent', 'looks', 'like.This', 'needs', 'be', 're-issued', 'Perhaps', 'Blu-ray', 'additional', 'footage', 'etc']",N/A

She's wonderful, extremely feminine, utterly poised, completely natural, brilliant, with a rare and beautiful voice.  Her lyrics shine as gems of insight.  She's a treasure to be near.The pre-show interviews on this dvd show her to be more popular with women than she is with men.  What I think is going on is that her fans adore her without aching to go to bed with her.  Her appeal isn't sex appeal, as it is with almost every other lead singer or actor.  She's not as cheap as that.  She's not like that idiot Brittany Spears dressing like a whore.In fact, Natalie is covered up almost as much as an Arab.  You can see her face, and her lower legs, but not a whole lot else.  She's just fine that way.  She sways and dances, she smiles and shares her wonderful personality, and you really don't need to see her cleavage.  There's no way in hell you're getting a peak at that.Think about the lyrics of most popular songs.  They are usually about either sex or an insincere phony version of moon-june boy-band romance for pre-teens.  Natalie is one antidote to that garbage.  But she is awfully sweet medicine.She's smart and completely without ego on stage.  She's deep too.  For those of you knowledgeable about astrology, she's a Scorpio, like Neil Young.  There's another brilliant songwriter who doesn't play ""star"" onstage, doesn't play celebrity, doesn't show ego.Natalie's band on this dvd is very good, as she herself comments late in the show.I was happy to hear her sing Beloved Wife, one of my favorite of her songs.  Who else but Natalie would write a song about an elderly couple's love for each other, the aged husband wondering if he should commit suicide to be with the beloved wife he has just lost to illness.  The lyrics of this song are priceless, and always reminded me of my own parents, when my mom was suffering with illness and my father was the caregiver.Who else could have written that song?  The only people I could think of are Simon and Garfunkel, for their song Old Friends.  So you can see what level Natalie is on.  She's writing with the intelligence and sensitivity of Simon and Garfunkel.  There aren't too many on that high level.I'm glad Natalie is in our artistic world.  With so much unoriginal garbage around, we're lucky to have her.",4,Didn't think of a title,1137801600,"01 21, 2006",2006,2298,"['Natalie', 'unique', 'wonderful', 'extremely', 'feminine', 'utterly', 'poised', 'completely', 'natural', 'brilliant', 'rare', 'beautiful', 'voice', 'lyrics', 'shine', 'gems', 'insight', 'treasure', 'be', 'near.The', 'pre-show', 'interviews', 'dvd', 'show', 'be', 'more', 'popular', 'women', 'men', 'What', 'think', 'going', 'fans', 'aching', 'go', 'bed', 'appeal', ""n't"", 'sex', 'appeal', 'almost', 'other', 'lead', 'singer', 'actor', 'not', 'as', 'cheap', 'not', 'idiot', 'Brittany', 'Spears', 'dressing', 'whore.In', 'fact', 'Natalie', 'covered', 'up', 'almost', 'as', 'much', 'Arab', 'can', 'see', 'face', 'lower', 'legs', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'else', 'just', 'fine', 'way', 'dances', 'shares', 'wonderful', 'personality', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'see', 'cleavage', 'way', 'hell', ""'re"", 'getting', 'peak', 'that.Think', 'lyrics', 'most', 'popular', 'songs', 'are', 'usually', 'sex', 'insincere', 'phony', 'version', 'moon-june', 'boy-band', 'romance', 'pre-teens', 'Natalie', 'one', 'antidote', 'garbage', 'awfully', 'sweet', 'medicine.She', 'smart', 'completely', 'ego', 'stage', 'deep', 'too', 'knowledgeable', 'astrology', 'Scorpio', 'Neil', 'Young', 'brilliant', 'songwriter', 'who', ""n't"", 'play', 'star', 'onstage', ""n't"", 'play', 'celebrity', ""n't"", 'show', 'ego.Natalie', 'band', 'dvd', 'very', 'good', 'herself', 'comments', 'late', 'show.I', 'was', 'happy', 'hear', 'sing', 'Beloved', 'Wife', 'one', 'favorite', 'songs', 'Who', 'else', 'Natalie', 'would', 'write', 'song', 'elderly', 'couple', 'love', 'other', 'aged', 'husband', 'wondering', 'should', 'commit', 'suicide', 'be', 'beloved', 'wife', 'just', 'lost', 'illness', 'lyrics', 'song', 'are', 'priceless', 'always', 'reminded', 'own', 'parents', 'when', 'mom', 'was', 'suffering', 'illness', 'father', 'was', 'caregiver.Who', 'else', 'could', 'have', 'written', 'song', 'only', 'people', 'could', 'think', 'are', 'Simon', 'Garfunkel', 'song', 'Old', 'Friends', 'can', 'see', 'what', 'level', 'Natalie', 'writing', 'intelligence', 'sensitivity', 'Simon', 'Garfunkel', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'many', 'high', 'level.I', ""'m"", 'glad', 'Natalie', 'artistic', 'world', 'so', 'much', 'unoriginal', 'garbage', 'around', ""'re"", 'lucky', 'have']",N/A

I have been a Natalie fan since back in the 10,000 Maniacs days and all I can say about this DVD is WOW! Granted the &quot;special features&quot; aren't all that special...but the FEELING of actually being at this concert is a joy. For all the true fans...This DVD was recorded on June 12th 1999; this was one day before her CD of the same title was recorded. That alone is pretty cool. The people that have complained about the &quot;quality&quot; of the lighting and such on this DVD are NOT taking into account that this was filmed at a LIVE concert! Go watch Pink Ployd's Pulse, and lets see you make the same complaint. This is totally worth the money for the great visuals and audio of Natalie Merchant's wonderfull abilities in a wonderfull setting. Can you say &quot;live in a hall on DVD&quot;?

I've only seen one of her shows years ago but I couldn't hear her and I don't think she put on this much of a production back then.  She is AWESOME!
