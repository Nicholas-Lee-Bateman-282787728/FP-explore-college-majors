Talking heads and short clips is the M.O. here.It moves quickly, skipping through the high points so fast you might find it hard to believe they've said all they're going to say about ""Kind of Blue,"" ""Sketches of Spain,"" ""Bitches Brew,"" etc.  And since this is a Sony project, they give particularly short shrift to his pre-Columbia years.Granted, it would take hours to cover all the various aspects of Miles Davis' art sufficiently and this program is merely intended to give an overview.  But watching it, I wasn't sure if a newcomer would be pulled into the documentary or if, overwhelmed by the pace and the subject, they might get a little bored.I'll watch and, on some level, enjoy *anything* that features the music, performances and photographs of one of my favorite jazz icons, but Sony should apply the same marketing strategy they're currently employing with the Miles Davis box sets and start issuing as much live performance footage as they can on video, particularly in light of the enthusiasm of myself and the other reviewers.",3,"Spotty and spread too thin, but a decent introduction",1097366400,"10 10, 2004",2004,1477,"['Glad', 'decided', 'Netflix', 'instead', 'making', 'impulse', 'buy', 'know', 'very', 'least', 'basics', 'work', 'career', ""'re"", 'bound', 'be', 'frustrated', 'by-the-numbers', 'skip', 'Davis', 'life.Since', 'just', 'one', 'figure', 'Miles', 'Davis', 'Story', 'able', 'focus', 'Miles', 'more', 'intense', 'magnification', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'Jazz', 'was', 'sorely', 'entity', 'engaging', 'fascinating', 'approach', 'Talking', 'heads', 'short', 'clips', 'M.O', 'here.It', 'moves', 'quickly', 'skipping', 'high', 'points', 'so', 'fast', 'might', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', ""'ve"", 'said', ""'re"", 'going', 'say', 'Kind', 'Blue', 'Sketches', 'Spain', 'Bitches', 'Brew', 'etc', 'Sony', 'project', 'give', 'particularly', 'short', 'shrift', 'pre-Columbia', 'years.Granted', 'would', 'take', 'hours', 'cover', 'various', 'aspects', 'Miles', 'Davis', 'art', 'sufficiently', 'program', 'merely', 'intended', 'give', 'overview', 'watching', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'newcomer', 'would', 'be', 'pulled', 'documentary', 'overwhelmed', 'pace', 'subject', 'might', 'get', 'little', 'bored.I', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'level', 'enjoy', '*anything*', 'music', 'performances', 'photographs', 'one', 'favorite', 'jazz', 'icons', 'Sony', 'should', 'apply', 'same', 'marketing', 'strategy', ""'re"", 'currently', 'employing', 'Miles', 'Davis', 'box', 'sets', 'start', 'issuing', 'as', 'much', 'live', 'performance', 'footage', 'can', 'video', 'particularly', 'light', 'enthusiasm', 'myself', 'other', 'reviewers']",The Miles Davis Story

It covers the various decades of Miles' life and the evolution of his music.  Many facts that I didn't know about the man and his music are covered here. Did you know he was supposed to collaborate with Jimi Hendrix before he died? WOW! Very entertaining and still leaves a certain mystique surrounding the man with the horn.  Very insightful interviews with his sidemen as well (Hancock, Jarret, DeJohnette, Corea, Zawinul, Liebman).Trust me, if you primarily want to see Miles' in concert buy ""Miles Electric: A different Kind of Blue"", I highly reccomend it.

726562,AO4A961ZKHJPL,B00007CVRL,"Enrique Torres ""Rico""","[1, 3]",Rather than focus on what it is not I prefer to focus on what it is; a documentary that utilizes people from Miles Davis life and Miles himself to comment on his eclectic life. I for one found it interesting to hear his ex-wives and fellow musicians making  commentary on the lives and times of Miles. It is pretty funny listening to everyone tell stories in mock wispy Miles voice; it seems as though everyone tries to imitate his throat box whisper. The sequence of events are interesting as everyone recalls what he was like at a given point in time. Most interesting of all is Miles telling his own story as he tells little stories about different parts of his life.It is a shame there is not more music but when there is it is amazing. It is especially amazing to see the events of his life unfold in conjunction with the music. The various phases of his life are covered in depth and the pace is fast enough to keep you invloved throughout the disc. The narrative speakover is typical of documentaries in that it grabs you and demands you to pay attention. The musical snippets are brief but the story is well told. The concert material is worthwhile although not nearly long enough. The fusion period is very captivating both as a story and as performance.If you are into Miles Davis you will like having this added to your collection. It is a part of the total picture that will help make your collection complete.,4,The Man and very little horn,1172448000,"02 26, 2007",2007,1422,"['Rather', 'focus', 'what', 'not', 'prefer', 'focus', 'what', 'documentary', 'utilizes', 'people', 'Miles', 'Davis', 'life', 'Miles', 'comment', 'eclectic', 'life', 'one', 'found', 'interesting', 'hear', 'ex-wives', 'fellow', 'musicians', 'making', 'commentary', 'lives', 'times', 'Miles', 'pretty', 'funny', 'listening', 'everyone', 'tell', 'stories', 'mock', 'wispy', 'Miles', 'voice', 'everyone', 'tries', 'imitate', 'throat', 'box', 'whisper', 'sequence', 'events', 'are', 'interesting', 'everyone', 'what', 'was', 'given', 'point', 'time', 'Most', 'interesting', 'Miles', 'telling', 'own', 'story', 'little', 'stories', 'different', 'parts', 'life.It', 'shame', 'not', 'more', 'music', 'when', 'amazing', 'especially', 'amazing', 'see', 'events', 'life', 'unfold', 'conjunction', 'music', 'various', 'phases', 'life', 'are', 'covered', 'depth', 'pace', 'fast', 'enough', 'keep', 'invloved', 'disc', 'narrative', 'speakover', 'typical', 'documentaries', 'demands', 'pay', 'attention', 'musical', 'snippets', 'are', 'brief', 'story', 'well', 'told', 'concert', 'material', 'worthwhile', 'not', 'nearly', 'long', 'enough', 'fusion', 'period', 'very', 'captivating', 'story', 'performance.If', 'are', 'Miles', 'Davis', 'will', 'like', 'having', 'added', 'collection', 'part', 'total', 'picture', 'will', 'help', 'make', 'collection', 'complete']",The Miles Davis Story

Historical-, social-, personal-, musical-, and all sorts of -markers are scattered throughout, at times even connected.From a musical perspective, as others here suggest, this material comes short by not providing full(er) versions of Miles' works. Worse yet, it is the absence of most any conceptual considerations regarding Miles Davis' works that bothers your exigent documentary-viewer. For example, was he a religious man, did philosophy matter to him, what was his debt to, let's say, classical and other forms of music? We learn, in passing, from family members about his listening to Khatchaturian and French impressionists or to Flamenco music in preparation of Sketches of Spain. We also learn about his interest in painting and drawing though there is no connecting line back into/from his jazz music. Too little analysis, too many trivial facts. In other words, the viewer is left wanting to learn more about how much of Miles' creation was pure instinct vs. informed?Oh well, most interviews were taped in 1986 (he was still alive) and he wasn't making a good interviewee either. Apparently, too little time has passed for us to comprehend Miles Davis beyond the tunes of his recorded music. It will take time, and who knows how many degrees in musicology to start figuring out the enigma behind the notes.On a technical note, this DVD brings little in addition to the VHS version since the menu-items are few and slooow to move among.Considering its price, this DVD could safely make do  as an introduction to Miles Davis' or as a pleasant encounter with some jazz legends of the past century.",3,adequate intro / short encouters,1095984000,"09 24, 2004",2004,1673,"['possible', 'entry', 'point', 'Miles', 'Davis', 'life', 'creation', 'Historical-', 'social-', 'personal-', 'musical-', 'sorts', '-markers', 'are', 'scattered', 'times', 'even', 'connected.From', 'musical', 'perspective', 'others', 'here', 'suggest', 'material', 'short', 'not', 'providing', 'full', 'er', 'versions', 'Miles', 'works', 'Worse', 'yet', 'absence', 'most', 'conceptual', 'considerations', 'regarding', 'Miles', 'Davis', 'works', 'bothers', 'exigent', 'documentary-viewer', 'example', 'was', 'religious', 'man', 'did', 'philosophy', 'matter', 'what', 'was', 'debt', 'let', 'say', 'classical', 'other', 'forms', 'music', 'learn', 'passing', 'family', 'members', 'listening', 'Khatchaturian', 'French', 'impressionists', 'Flamenco', 'music', 'preparation', 'Sketches', 'Spain', 'also', 'learn', 'interest', 'painting', 'drawing', 'connecting', 'line', 'back', 'jazz', 'music', 'Too', 'little', 'analysis', 'too', 'many', 'trivial', 'facts', 'other', 'words', 'viewer', 'left', 'wanting', 'learn', 'more', 'how', 'much', 'Miles', 'creation', 'was', 'pure', 'instinct', 'vs.', 'informed', 'Oh', 'well', 'most', 'interviews', 'were', 'taped', '1986', 'was', 'still', 'alive', 'was', ""n't"", 'making', 'good', 'interviewee', 'Apparently', 'too', 'little', 'time', 'passed', 'comprehend', 'Miles', 'Davis', 'tunes', 'recorded', 'music', 'will', 'take', 'time', 'who', 'how', 'many', 'degrees', 'musicology', 'start', 'figuring', 'out', 'enigma', 'notes.On', 'technical', 'note', 'DVD', 'little', 'addition', 'VHS', 'version', 'menu-items', 'are', 'few', 'slooow', 'move', 'among.Considering', 'price', 'DVD', 'could', 'safely', 'make', 'do', 'introduction', 'Miles', 'Davis', 'pleasant', 'encounter', 'jazz', 'legends', 'past', 'century']",The Miles Davis Story

726567,AM7PR12D8180Q,B00007CVRL,"J. Lund ""jazzbrat""","[45, 47]","This fast-paced two-hour documentary is probably the best introduction to the life of Miles Davis available, considerably more expansive than the hour-long 1986 PBS documentary MILES AHEAD.  Nonetheless, being that this product is a companion to the 2-CD career overview ESSENTIAL MILES DAVIS, that's a warning to Davis fans not to expect too much in the way of details or extensive video footage.  STORY provides a balanced presentation of his musical and personal life, from his upbringing in East St. Louis to his death in 1991...somewhat ala Ken Burns' JAZZ series (sans Wynton Marsalis and Stanley Crouch, of course), but much more concise due to the time constraints.  Those fans who are familiar with Miles' career won't find much new here, especially if you've read John Szwed's new bio SO WHAT.  For one, Miles' succession of musical achievements are alluded to but not examined in depth.As with Szwed's book, STORY benefits by the participation of family members, from ex-wives/partners Irene Cawthorn & Frances Davis to daughter Cheryl and youngest son Erin (who briefly joined Miles' band in 1990).  For the most part there is an uplifting sense of joy in the retracing of Miles' steps offered by both these participants and an impressive but too-short list of musicians newly interviewed (from Jimmy Cobb to Marcus Miller).  Many still-living sidepersons are conspicuous by their absence: one wonders did they decline to be interviewed...or were they not asked?  In addition, STORY lifts some interview segments from the 1984 CBS promo video, the above-mentioned PBS documentary, and other 1980s sources...so the voice of Miles and other greats who either have passed (e.g., Gil Evans, Dizzy Gillespie) or unavailable for this latest project (e.g., Keith Jarrett), are heard.For Miles fans the big frustration will be in seeing every performance clip shown for only a few seconds before there is a voice-over or cut to the next segment.  However, in trying to cover the life of an artist who was artistically productive for most of his adult life, one has to accept that Davis' story cannot be told in two hours without moving quickly through each period of his career.  Otherwise they might as well turn it into a multi-volume project (which btw is a great idea--ala the Beatles ANTHOLOGY video).  I was disappointed that no one from Miles' last band was interviewed (except for Erin), and surprised that no mention was made of the 1991 `Miles Plays Gil"" Montreux concert (the 1991 Paris ""reunion"" show two days later IS covered), or of Davis' last ""significant other"" (Jo Gelbard).  Hopefully Legacy will soon compile a video series that presents the wealth of available video footage in an unabridged form.  For now, STORY provides a concise overview of the life of Miles Davis that touches on rather than digs into the details.",4,"Good intro to Miles, but his fans deserve a boxed-set.",1038787200,"12 2, 2002",2002,2844,"['fast-paced', 'two-hour', 'documentary', 'probably', 'best', 'introduction', 'life', 'Miles', 'Davis', 'available', 'considerably', 'more', 'expansive', 'hour-long', '1986', 'PBS', 'documentary', 'MILES', 'AHEAD', 'Nonetheless', 'being', 'product', 'companion', '2-CD', 'career', 'overview', 'ESSENTIAL', 'MILES', 'DAVIS', 'warning', 'Davis', 'fans', 'not', 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'way', 'details', 'extensive', 'video', 'footage', 'STORY', 'balanced', 'presentation', 'musical', 'personal', 'life', 'upbringing', 'East', 'St.', 'Louis', 'death', '1991', 'somewhat', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'JAZZ', 'series', 'sans', 'Wynton', 'Marsalis', 'Stanley', 'Crouch', 'course', 'much', 'more', 'concise', 'due', 'time', 'constraints', 'fans', 'who', 'are', 'familiar', 'Miles', 'career', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'much', 'new', 'here', 'especially', ""'ve"", 'read', 'John', 'Szwed', 'new', 'bio', 'SO', 'WHAT', 'one', 'Miles', 'succession', 'musical', 'achievements', 'are', 'alluded', 'not', 'examined', 'depth.As', 'Szwed', 'book', 'STORY', 'benefits', 'participation', 'family', 'members', 'ex-wives/partners', 'Irene', 'Cawthorn', 'Frances', 'Davis', 'daughter', 'Cheryl', 'youngest', 'son', 'Erin', 'who', 'briefly', 'joined', 'Miles', 'band', '1990', 'most', 'part', 'uplifting', 'sense', 'joy', 'retracing', 'Miles', 'steps', 'offered', 'participants', 'impressive', 'too-short', 'list', 'musicians', 'newly', 'interviewed', 'Jimmy', 'Cobb', 'Marcus', 'Miller', 'Many', 'still-living', 'sidepersons', 'are', 'conspicuous', 'absence', 'one', 'wonders', 'did', 'decline', 'be', 'interviewed', 'were', 'not', 'asked', 'addition', 'STORY', 'interview', 'segments', '1984', 'CBS', 'promo', 'video', 'above-mentioned', 'PBS', 'documentary', 'other', '1980s', 'sources', 'so', 'voice', 'Miles', 'other', 'greats', 'who', 'have', 'passed', 'e.g.', 'Gil', 'Evans', 'Dizzy', 'Gillespie', 'unavailable', 'latest', 'project', 'e.g.', 'Keith', 'Jarrett', 'are', 'heard.For', 'Miles', 'big', 'frustration', 'will', 'be', 'seeing', 'performance', 'clip', 'shown', 'only', 'few', 'seconds', 'voice-over', 'cut', 'next', 'segment', 'However', 'trying', 'cover', 'life', 'artist', 'who', 'was', 'artistically', 'productive', 'most', 'adult', 'life', 'one', 'accept', 'Davis', 'story', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'told', 'two', 'hours', 'moving', 'quickly', 'period', 'career', 'Otherwise', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'turn', 'multi-volume', 'project', 'btw', 'great', 'idea', 'Beatles', 'ANTHOLOGY', 'video', 'was', 'disappointed', 'one', 'Miles', 'last', 'band', 'was', 'interviewed', 'Erin', 'surprised', 'mention', 'was', 'made', '1991', 'Miles', 'Gil', 'Montreux', 'concert', '1991', 'Paris', 'reunion', 'show', 'two', 'days', 'later', 'IS', 'covered', 'Davis', 'last', 'significant', 'other', 'Jo', 'Gelbard', 'Hopefully', 'Legacy', 'will', 'soon', 'compile', 'video', 'series', 'wealth', 'available', 'video', 'footage', 'unabridged', 'form', 'now', 'STORY', 'concise', 'overview', 'life', 'Miles', 'Davis', 'rather', 'digs', 'details']",The Miles Davis Story

Should have clocked in at 4 hours - at the very least!6 hours might have done the man and his prodigious careerjustice.  Might have, if it was organised intelligentlywith an emphasis on THE MUSIC and how and why it was maderather than the dude's personal life.2. Weighted with lots of gossipy interviews in an attempt toilluminate the person behind the persona. Which is fine andvalid, as far as that sort of thing goes.  Unfortunately,this stunt is attempted in a suspiciously selective way:ex-wives, some business associates, a relative or two anda handful of former sideman; but either too little too oftenor too much too frequently to be fair to someone who cannotdefend himself (not that Miles would even care to bother).3. Likewise, plods through some relatively minor stuff that wasobviously readily available (case in point: long segments onthe Louis Malle score), while absurdly glossing over so manykey periods (example: everything between Jack Johnson andthe 1980 comeback is treated as some drug-addled aberration).Taken in tandem with Ken Burns' lame treatment of Miles,similarly stupidly dismissive of the Dark Magus period, thisuncoolness is more than annoying - its insulting.4. A biographer who does not seem to be at all hip. I cannotbelieve how inept his description of a saxophonist's playingwas.  Does this guy know anything about music? Don't seemso.

Very eccentric, sometimes mean.Probably misunderstood but it all envelopes him and made him the man he became. Anyone that loved Miles Davis this is a must buy to get a better understanding of why he would play live shows with his back to the audience. Clever he is in my opinion. What also blew me away is how he worked with most of the modern jazz musicians we see today such as, Marcus Miller, Herbie Hancock, John Scofield, Chick Correa, Keith Jarrett, the list goes on. Miles never ending struggle to reach new boundaries with his horn is inspiring. Miles, a true musician that never wanted be pigeon-holed in one style or genre of music.",5,MILES AHEAD OF THE REST,1203033600,"02 15, 2008",2008,754,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'documentary', 'Miles', 'gave', 'more', 'insight', 'man', 'love', 'music', 'Very', 'eccentric', 'sometimes', 'mean.Probably', 'misunderstood', 'made', 'man', 'became', 'Anyone', 'loved', 'Miles', 'Davis', 'must', 'buy', 'get', 'better', 'understanding', 'why', 'would', 'play', 'live', 'shows', 'back', 'audience', 'Clever', 'opinion', 'What', 'also', 'blew', 'away', 'how', 'worked', 'most', 'modern', 'jazz', 'musicians', 'see', 'today', 'such', 'Marcus', 'Miller', 'Herbie', 'Hancock', 'John', 'Scofield', 'Chick', 'Correa', 'Keith', 'Jarrett', 'list', 'Miles', 'never', 'ending', 'struggle', 'reach', 'new', 'boundaries', 'horn', 'inspiring', 'Miles', 'true', 'musician', 'never', 'wanted', 'be', 'pigeon-holed', 'one', 'style', 'genre', 'music']",The Miles Davis Story

There are some samplings from each phase of Miles' muscial career, however this is not meant to be a concert film. This is great documentary film making with interviews from numerous musicians, friends, family,lovers , etc that really gets to the essence of who Miles Davis was and most importantly shows clearly the influence this man had on jazz music in the second half of the 20th century. The testimony of so many jazz greats speaks for itself. Miles Davis' life was remarkable in many aspects and is certainly deserving of this  type of treatment. I thoroughly enjoyed this and am happy to own a copy. Miles' recordings are there for the listening. This film enhances my understanding of the individual responsible for some of the best music ever created.",5,This is a great biographic documentary,1072224000,"12 24, 2003",2003,824,"['Many', 'below', 'have', 'complained', 'lack', 'performance', 'footage', 'are', 'samplings', 'phase', 'Miles', 'muscial', 'career', 'however', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'concert', 'film', 'great', 'documentary', 'film', 'making', 'interviews', 'numerous', 'musicians', 'friends', 'family', 'lovers', 'etc', 'really', 'essence', 'who', 'Miles', 'Davis', 'was', 'most', 'importantly', 'clearly', 'influence', 'man', 'had', 'jazz', 'music', 'second', 'half', '20th', 'century', 'testimony', 'so', 'many', 'jazz', 'greats', 'speaks', 'Miles', 'Davis', 'life', 'was', 'remarkable', 'many', 'aspects', 'certainly', 'deserving', 'type', 'treatment', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'am', 'happy', 'own', 'copy', 'Miles', 'recordings', 'are', 'there', 'listening', 'film', 'understanding', 'individual', 'responsible', 'best', 'music', 'ever', 'created']",The Miles Davis Story

So when I saw this DVD in the public library, I jumped at a chance to watch it and learn.The story wanders through Miles Davis' life, interviewing him, his fellow musicians, biographers, ex-wives and girlfriends. It does a great story of bringing to life the musical magus as he was known and loved. We learn about his upbringing in Saint Louis, how he fathered three children while still in his teens, his musical upbringing, the throat operation that left him with a raspy voice and his first big breaks. Then there is the early first trip to Europe, where he got an enthusiastic reception and was treated as an equal. He got a scarf from a French girlfriend that he always wore. There's the anecdote about how, when he was already very famous, how he was three hours later for a concert in Venice. Facing an angry crowd that has been kept waiting a very long time, he lifted up his trumpet to play, and within 25 seconds you could hear a pin drop in the audience. Bizarre, freaky musical discipline with an eagle eye towards innovation. ""Keith, you know why I don't play ballads any more? Because I like playing ballads so much.""Miles Davis was a good cook too, cooked up fish for Bill Evans.",5,Great intro to the master,1327276800,"01 23, 2012",2012,1359,"[""'m"", 'embarrassed', 'say', 'know', 'nearly', 'nothing', 'Miles', 'Davis', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'musicians', 'era', 'said', 'major', 'cultural', 'icon', 'as', 'well', 'when', 'saw', 'DVD', 'public', 'library', 'jumped', 'chance', 'watch', 'learn.The', 'story', 'wanders', 'Miles', 'Davis', 'life', 'interviewing', 'fellow', 'musicians', 'biographers', 'ex-wives', 'girlfriends', 'great', 'story', 'bringing', 'life', 'musical', 'magus', 'was', 'known', 'loved', 'learn', 'upbringing', 'Saint', 'Louis', 'how', 'fathered', 'three', 'children', 'still', 'teens', 'musical', 'upbringing', 'throat', 'operation', 'left', 'raspy', 'voice', 'first', 'big', 'breaks', 'Then', 'early', 'first', 'trip', 'Europe', 'where', 'got', 'enthusiastic', 'reception', 'was', 'treated', 'equal', 'got', 'scarf', 'French', 'girlfriend', 'always', 'wore', 'anecdote', 'how', 'when', 'was', 'already', 'very', 'famous', 'how', 'was', 'three', 'hours', 'later', 'concert', 'Venice', 'Facing', 'angry', 'crowd', 'been', 'kept', 'waiting', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'lifted', 'up', 'trumpet', 'play', '25', 'seconds', 'could', 'hear', 'pin', 'drop', 'audience', 'Bizarre', 'freaky', 'musical', 'discipline', 'eagle', 'eye', 'innovation', 'Keith', 'know', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'play', 'ballads', 'more', 'like', 'playing', 'ballads', 'so', 'much', 'Miles', 'Davis', 'was', 'good', 'cook', 'too', 'cooked', 'up', 'fish', 'Bill', 'Evans']",The Miles Davis Story
