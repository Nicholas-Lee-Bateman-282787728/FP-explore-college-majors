It concerns a group of college friends who begin dying in godawful (and quite original) ways, after one of them inherits a mysterious wooden box. The survivors must figure out what's happening and how to stop the carnage, if they want to live. Just imagine if SAW's Jigsaw could use black magik, and you'll be pretty close to guessing how this one goes. Extra points for A- The cool-looking box of doom, and B- the way it works.

1494269,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,B005M2A4BQ,Einsatz,"[1, 1]","What would you get if Rube Goldberg got together with a practitioner of Voodoo: The Box.  But since that title was already taken, and ruined, Needle it is.  Because goodness knows, Le Vaudou Mort wouldn't have had anyone running for the theater (or in this case, wherever you can purchase DVDs).The plot is a poor attempt to mix horror with mystery (although it owes a lot to Agatha Christie's mystery, And Then There Were None).  The attempt to find out what was going on is handled so casually it's a wonder they even bothered.  There is absolutely no sense of urgency until the very end.  By that time, it's too late to invest any interest in the proceedings.  Suddenly, after a very lengthy ramble, the villain is unmasked and it's over, leaving one with a lot of unanswered questions (lapses in logic notwithstanding).  As this type of genre goes, the filmmakers played it rather safe; neither spooky enough nor gory enough for the type of audience they must have aimed for and missed.  It's tepid at best, just interesting enough to justify its almost 90 minute length.Among the actors, the only one who stood out was Travis Fimmel, and I'm not certain whether that was a good thing or not.  His performance was weird to say the least.  I kept thinking, as a photographer for the police, maybe they should have given him a few more surprise drug tests than most.  His behavior was decidedly odd throughout, made even more apparent when doing scenes opposite his brother (Michael Dorman), who came across more mundane than just ordinary.  I will say I was kept fascinated by the prospect of what Travis Fimmel's crazy character would do next, forgetting what the movie was about.  For a supporting character, it's never a good thing to eclipse the movie as a whole.After it was over, I immediately tossed the DVD into my discard pile, never to watch again (not because it was a bad movie, but because it failed to reach for anything beyond the norm).

1494273,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B005M2A4BQ,Mark Turner,"[5, 5]","It would seem that the well would run dry of ideas for a decent horror film these days. We've had tons of slashers and serial killers, demons and wizards, witches and warlocks and vampires that run from blue faced ghouls to sparkly inspirations for lust. But still once in a while a decent idea comes along that's new and fresh. The only problem is it usually ends up in a so so film like NEEDLE.Opening with the death of a dirty artifact dealer years ago by some remote instrument, the film moves forward to the present day. Ben Rutherford is a college student with the usual group of friends (which these days means there must be at least one gay couple). The family lawyer shows one day with an item belonging to his late father, an item found in a warehouse, an intricate box with a burned picture inserted in it, ornate metalwork and a crank. With no idea what it is or what it's for, Ben shows it off to his friends that night.Waking the next morning with a hangover, Ben discovers the box is missing. Having taken a picture of it the night before, he takes that to a teacher who specializes in antiquities to see if she has an idea of what it is. Eventually she lets him know that the French inscribed on it seems to lead her to think it was connected to the Grand Guignol, the graphic horror shows from France around 1800. After talking to someone she knows, it is later discovered this is a machine made to wreak revenge on others and worth nearly $500,000 to the right buyer.At the same time this is going on, Ben's brother Marcus is attempting to make contact with him once more. Having left behind the family years ago he hopes to reunite but Ben isn't having any of it. To say he carries a grudge is oversimplification. But the two are forced together as Ben's friends begin dying in mysterious ways. Since Marcus is the crime scene photographer he takes an interest in the murders and trying to solve them.The list of suspects includes nearly everyone seen so far, from various friends (that don't get killed off) to Ben's teacher to even Marcus. When it's finally revealed who the killer is it is actually a bit of a surprise, a nice twist.But the mystery isn't the main reason fans of horror films watch these days. Hardcore fans are there for the kills and how original they are and they're fairly inventive here. We watch as a gloved hand pours wax and blood into the box, inserts a picture of one of Ben's friends, turns the crank and then extracts a wax figure. The hand then wields damage to the figure which in turn happens to that friend, everything from limbs torn off to eyes skewered.What makes this film part of the so so crowd is that while well made it doesn't leap from B-movie status to top line feature. The acting ranges from believable to mediocre not helped by a script that does the same. Still it made for a nice evening's entertainment and would be well worth the cost of rental.",3,YOU DO THAT VOODOO...,1332806400,"03 27, 2012",2012,2917,"['would', 'seem', 'well', 'would', 'run', 'dry', 'ideas', 'decent', 'horror', 'film', 'days', ""'ve"", 'had', 'tons', 'slashers', 'serial', 'killers', 'demons', 'wizards', 'witches', 'warlocks', 'vampires', 'run', 'blue', 'faced', 'ghouls', 'sparkly', 'inspirations', 'lust', 'still', 'once', 'while', 'decent', 'idea', 'new', 'fresh', 'only', 'problem', 'usually', 'up', 'so', 'so', 'film', 'NEEDLE.Opening', 'death', 'dirty', 'artifact', 'dealer', 'years', 'ago', 'remote', 'instrument', 'film', 'forward', 'present', 'day', 'Ben', 'Rutherford', 'college', 'student', 'usual', 'group', 'friends', 'days', 'must', 'be', 'least', 'one', 'gay', 'couple', 'family', 'lawyer', 'one', 'day', 'item', 'belonging', 'late', 'father', 'item', 'found', 'warehouse', 'intricate', 'box', 'burned', 'picture', 'inserted', 'ornate', 'metalwork', 'crank', 'idea', 'what', 'what', 'Ben', 'off', 'friends', 'night.Waking', 'next', 'morning', 'hangover', 'Ben', 'box', 'missing', 'Having', 'taken', 'picture', 'night', 'before', 'teacher', 'who', 'antiquities', 'see', 'idea', 'what', 'Eventually', 'know', 'French', 'inscribed', 'lead', 'think', 'was', 'connected', 'Grand', 'Guignol', 'graphic', 'horror', 'shows', 'France', '1800', 'talking', 'someone', 'later', 'discovered', 'machine', 'made', 'wreak', 'revenge', 'others', 'worth', 'nearly', '500,000', 'right', 'buyer.At', 'same', 'time', 'going', 'Ben', 'brother', 'Marcus', 'attempting', 'make', 'contact', 'once', 'more', 'Having', 'left', 'family', 'years', 'ago', 'reunite', 'Ben', ""n't"", 'having', 'say', 'grudge', 'oversimplification', 'two', 'are', 'forced', 'together', 'Ben', 'friends', 'begin', 'dying', 'mysterious', 'ways', 'Marcus', 'crime', 'scene', 'photographer', 'interest', 'murders', 'trying', 'solve', 'them.The', 'list', 'suspects', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'seen', 'so', 'far', 'various', 'friends', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'killed', 'off', 'Ben', 'teacher', 'even', 'Marcus', 'When', 'finally', 'revealed', 'who', 'killer', 'actually', 'bit', 'surprise', 'nice', 'twist.But', 'mystery', ""n't"", 'main', 'reason', 'fans', 'horror', 'films', 'watch', 'days', 'Hardcore', 'fans', 'are', 'there', 'kills', 'how', 'original', 'are', ""'re"", 'fairly', 'inventive', 'here', 'watch', 'gloved', 'hand', 'pours', 'wax', 'blood', 'box', 'picture', 'one', 'Ben', 'friends', 'crank', 'then', 'wax', 'figure', 'hand', 'then', 'damage', 'figure', 'turn', 'happens', 'friend', 'everything', 'limbs', 'torn', 'off', 'eyes', 'skewered.What', 'film', 'part', 'so', 'so', 'crowd', 'well', 'made', ""n't"", 'leap', 'B-movie', 'status', 'top', 'line', 'feature', 'acting', 'ranges', 'believable', 'mediocre', 'not', 'helped', 'script', 'same', 'Still', 'made', 'nice', 'evening', 'entertainment', 'would', 'be', 'well', 'cost', 'rental']",Needle
