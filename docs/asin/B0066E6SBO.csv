1511026,A3PPSZB0W5DZH6,B0066E6SBO,"DEWEY M. ""MOVIE & MUSICAL THEATRE MAN""","[19, 19]","After her eight year run on the classic TV Sitcom, ""Bewitched"", Elizabeth Montgomery appeared in several compelling TV Movies that showcased her amazing dramatic range and versatility. The subject matter was often grim (""A Case Of Rape"", ""The Legend Of Lizzie Borden"", ""With Murder In Mind""), but Elizabeth also played strong women who survived terrible situations with a great deal of courage and determination. ""Between The Darkness And The Dawn""  (1985)  falls into this category.17 year old Abby suddenly falls into a coma. She remains in a zombie-like state, similar to the patients in the movie ""Awakenings"", for 20 years. Her devoted mother Beryl (Dorothy McQuire) believes that Abby is still alive and vital, somewhere deep down inside, and trying to wake up and return to the world. She decides to try a new experimental drug called ""El Dopa."" Then, one evening, Abby wakes up again; just as suddenly as she fell into her coma. Everyone is in for major shocks and adjustments. Abby must come to terms with the heartbreaking realization that she is not 17; that she has, in fact, lost 20 years of her life. ""Where was I, Mama, -- when I grew old?"", she cries. On top of this, her resentful, jealous sister Ellen (Karen Grassle) married her high school sweetheart David. But Abby, with a sense of child-like wonder, does discover the world again. Elizabeth Montgomery is delightful in these scenes; especially when she bursts into uncontrollable laughter upon learning that Ronald Regan is President of The United States!James Naughton is nicely paired with Montgomery as Jack, a teacher (and love interest) who helps Abby reach for new goals and make the most of her life.  While on a date with Jack, Abby gets a ""beauty make-over"" at the Mall. Elizabeth Montgomery, of course, is breathtakingly beautiful in these scenes. But her outstanding performance is the reason to watch. Elizabeth Montgomery's fans will definitely want to add ""Between The Darkness And The Dawn"" to their DVD Collection.",4,ANOTHER OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE BY THE AMAZNG ELIZABETH MONTGOMERY,1328227200,"02 3, 2012",2012,2003,"['eight', 'year', 'run', 'classic', 'TV', 'Sitcom', 'Bewitched', 'Elizabeth', 'Montgomery', 'appeared', 'several', 'compelling', 'TV', 'Movies', 'showcased', 'amazing', 'dramatic', 'range', 'versatility', 'subject', 'matter', 'was', 'often', 'grim', 'Case', 'Rape', 'Legend', 'Lizzie', 'Borden', 'Murder', 'Mind', 'Elizabeth', 'also', 'played', 'strong', 'women', 'who', 'survived', 'terrible', 'situations', 'great', 'deal', 'courage', 'determination', 'Darkness', 'Dawn', '1985', 'category.17', 'year', 'old', 'Abby', 'suddenly', 'coma', 'zombie-like', 'state', 'similar', 'patients', 'movie', 'Awakenings', '20', 'years', 'devoted', 'mother', 'Beryl', 'Dorothy', 'McQuire', 'Abby', 'still', 'alive', 'vital', 'somewhere', 'deep', 'inside', 'trying', 'wake', 'up', 'return', 'world', 'try', 'new', 'experimental', 'drug', 'called', 'El', 'Dopa', 'Then', 'one', 'evening', 'Abby', 'up', 'again', 'just', 'as', 'suddenly', 'fell', 'coma', 'Everyone', 'major', 'shocks', 'adjustments', 'Abby', 'must', 'come', 'terms', 'heartbreaking', 'realization', 'not', '17', 'fact', 'lost', '20', 'years', 'life', 'Where', 'was', 'Mama', 'when', 'grew', 'old', 'top', 'resentful', 'jealous', 'sister', 'Ellen', 'Karen', 'Grassle', 'married', 'high', 'school', 'sweetheart', 'David', 'Abby', 'sense', 'child-like', 'wonder', 'discover', 'world', 'again', 'Elizabeth', 'Montgomery', 'delightful', 'scenes', 'especially', 'when', 'uncontrollable', 'laughter', 'learning', 'Ronald', 'Regan', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'James', 'Naughton', 'nicely', 'paired', 'Montgomery', 'Jack', 'teacher', 'love', 'interest', 'who', 'Abby', 'reach', 'new', 'goals', 'make', 'most', 'life', 'date', 'Jack', 'Abby', 'beauty', 'make-over', 'Mall', 'Elizabeth', 'Montgomery', 'course', 'breathtakingly', 'beautiful', 'scenes', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'reason', 'watch', 'Elizabeth', 'Montgomery', 'fans', 'will', 'definitely', 'want', 'add', 'Between', 'Darkness', 'Dawn', 'DVD', 'Collection']",Between Darkness & Dawn
1511027,A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ,B0066E6SBO,Kasey G,"[11, 11]","While nowhere near as good as her early output such as ""A Case of Rape"" and ""The Legend of Lizzie Borden"", ""Between the Darkness and the Dawn"" is perhaps Elizabeth Montgomery's best TV-Movie of the 1980s.Here she plays a teenager named Abigal who slips into a coma and remains there for 20 years, cared for by her mother (Dorothy Mcguire). When some risky but miraculous new drugs snap her out of it, she needs to pick up her life as a woman in her late thirties who never graduated high school, held a job, or married and started a family.Complicating things is that her sister (Karen Grassle) has married Abby's high school sweetheart David and they now have a teenaged son Matthew, who's a dead ringer for his father at that age. Old teenage rivalries and resentments resurface between the sisters. It's fun to see ""Ma Ingalls"" all decked out in '80s pastels and shoulder pads, though Grassle seems a little stiff in her early scenes.The best parts of the movie occur in the first two-thirds as we witness Liz's character slowly comprehend what's happened to her and demands McGuire tell her ""how long have I been asleep?""; her walk through town discovering how much things have changed as she watches an aerobics class in progress and walks into a video arcade. There are some humorous moments like the dinner table scene when an incredulous Liz says ""Ronald Reagan is PRESIDENT??"". In the last third, the script becomes very predictable and the movie loses steam.James Naughton plays the high-school coach who helps Liz earn her diploma and the two fall in love. Marcia Rodd appears as an old school chum who's own life gives Abby/Liz some new perspective.Warner Archive has done it again and the film looks terrific: bright, crisp and clear. **NOTE** See the Images section of this product for the screen captures I posted.
