854999,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B00049QQP0,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[1, 1]","In 20 Minute Yoga Makeover: Weight Loss, instructor Sara Ivanhoe connects various series of poses--or vinyasas--in a flowing manner. Although she repeatedly states that the addition of movement in the poses (namely moving the arms while inhaling and exhaling) will keep your heart rate up and contribute to weight loss, the practice isn't nearly aerobic enough for this purpose. However, the practice is suited to those who prefer movement rather than static poses.  Instructor comments: Sara Ivanhoe comes across as similar to in her Crunch videos--if you liked her down-to-earth style (although sometimes she is seen as a bit patronizing), you will probably like her here as well.Sara begins with a chair pose vinyasa, adding arm movement and a forward bend and linking the series with breath; this is followed by a standing backbend combined with forward bend series. Next comes a vinyasa that is repeated throughout the workout: you move from plank to cobra to down dog, again combining the series with breath. From a 3-legged down dog position, Sara leads you into several series of standing poses: she begins with triangle/revolved triangle, moves on to warrior/side angle pose/revolved side angle in the next series, and finishes with crescent lunge/revolved crescent lunge. She completes the plank-cobra-down dog vinyasa between each series, eventually substituting upward dog for cobra. Finally, the practice ends in a seated position with head-to-knee pose and a brief hand mudra. Overall, this is a nicely flowing 20-minute practice with a standing pose focus.",4,Standing poses combined with movement to increase intensity,1105488000,"01 12, 2005",2005,1571,"['20', 'Minute', 'Yoga', 'Makeover', 'Weight', 'Loss', 'instructor', 'Sara', 'Ivanhoe', 'various', 'series', 'poses', 'vinyasas', 'flowing', 'manner', 'repeatedly', 'addition', 'movement', 'poses', 'namely', 'moving', 'arms', 'inhaling', 'exhaling', 'will', 'keep', 'heart', 'rate', 'contribute', 'weight', 'loss', 'practice', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'aerobic', 'enough', 'purpose', 'However', 'practice', 'suited', 'who', 'prefer', 'movement', 'rather', 'static', 'poses', 'Instructor', 'comments', 'Sara', 'Ivanhoe', 'similar', 'Crunch', 'videos', 'liked', 'down-to-earth', 'style', 'sometimes', 'seen', 'bit', 'patronizing', 'will', 'probably', 'here', 'well.Sara', 'chair', 'pose', 'vinyasa', 'adding', 'arm', 'movement', 'forward', 'bend', 'linking', 'series', 'breath', 'followed', 'standing', 'backbend', 'combined', 'forward', 'bend', 'series', 'Next', 'vinyasa', 'repeated', 'workout', 'move', 'plank', 'cobra', 'down', 'dog', 'again', 'combining', 'series', 'breath', '3-legged', 'down', 'dog', 'position', 'Sara', 'several', 'series', 'standing', 'poses', 'triangle/revolved', 'triangle', 'moves', 'warrior/side', 'angle', 'pose/revolved', 'side', 'angle', 'next', 'series', 'finishes', 'crescent', 'lunge/revolved', 'crescent', 'lunge', 'plank-cobra-down', 'dog', 'vinyasa', 'series', 'eventually', 'substituting', 'upward', 'dog', 'cobra', 'Finally', 'practice', 'seated', 'position', 'head-to-knee', 'pose', 'brief', 'hand', 'mudra', 'Overall', 'nicely', 'flowing', '20-minute', 'practice', 'standing', 'pose', 'focus']",N/A
855000,A32GK89C999834,B00049QQP0,"Elisa ""HipMom""","[1, 1]","This is, to date, my favorite yoga DVD. I have been practicing yoga (mostly Power Yoga and Vinyasa) on and off for about 6 years. After the birth of my 2nd child and a move overseas it has become increasingly difficult to fit in exercise, particularly anything I coulnd't do with my new baby, like Pilates or Yoga. This DVD was my introduction to Sara Ivanhoe and I was instantly hooked. Aside from being easy to fit in, this is also a remarkably well-designed yoga practice, especially considering it lasts only 20 minutes.Sara Ivanhoe is a fantastic instructor, who manages to blend perfect instruction and tips on good form and modifications with the focus on wellbeing that is so key to yoga. She has an accessible style that is great for those new to yoga and she manages to guide you through the poses without being distracting or overly chatty.This practice would work for anyone in the beginner/intermediate level, because of the easy modifications, and it is definitely recommended to anyone who has ever had to sacrifice their practice for time constraints - no more!",5,Excellent yoga routine for those tight on time!,1197417600,"12 12, 2007",2007,1077,"['date', 'favorite', 'yoga', 'DVD', 'have', 'been', 'practicing', 'yoga', 'mostly', 'Power', 'Yoga', 'Vinyasa', '6', 'years', 'birth', '2nd', 'child', 'move', 'overseas', 'become', 'increasingly', 'difficult', 'fit', 'exercise', 'particularly', 'anything', ""coulnd't"", 'do', 'new', 'baby', 'Pilates', 'Yoga', 'DVD', 'was', 'introduction', 'Sara', 'Ivanhoe', 'was', 'instantly', 'hooked', 'Aside', 'being', 'easy', 'fit', 'also', 'remarkably', 'well-designed', 'yoga', 'practice', 'especially', 'considering', 'only', '20', 'minutes.Sara', 'Ivanhoe', 'fantastic', 'instructor', 'who', 'blend', 'perfect', 'instruction', 'tips', 'good', 'form', 'modifications', 'focus', 'wellbeing', 'so', 'key', 'yoga', 'accessible', 'style', 'great', 'new', 'yoga', 'guide', 'poses', 'being', 'distracting', 'overly', 'chatty.This', 'practice', 'would', 'work', 'anyone', 'beginner/intermediate', 'level', 'easy', 'modifications', 'definitely', 'recommended', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'had', 'sacrifice', 'practice', 'time', 'constraints', 'more']",N/A

As yoga instructor to the stars, she must be in her element here, when she is targeting weight loss. I can't agree with the other reviewer who gave it only '3' stars that its not good cardio. Compared to other yoga workouts, its very good on that front. I feel like I have just done 15 min on a treadmill at weight loss target heart rate. But this workout, gives butt toning and thigh strengthening that I would NOT get on a treadmill -- so its really worth it. I did her butt workout (Sculpted Buns and Thighs) in this series as a beginner but would not do *this one* as a beginner without some technique instruction first. Its better for an advanced beginner as she does cobra and upward dog without pointers which could be dangerous without some background. Finally, I got this used from Goodwill of Southern CA & again from Goodwill Oregon; reconsider any used purchases from Goodwill!!! Both times Goodwill shipped the correct DVD jacket with the *incorrect DVD* inside - one time even refusing a return.

This is definitely a cardiovascular workout with aesthetic appeal. You have a beach in the background with waves gently lapping at the shore. Sara Ivanhoe exercises on the grass and you feel like you are at the beach.The deliciously challenging twists were the highlight of this practice session. The Vinyasa sections are exciting and challenging and you move from plank to cobra to down dog. Then she ups the challenge with a flowing series that moves into an upward facing dog.The active postures make this an invigorating and calorie-burning workout that also strengthens the arms and tones the entire body.The special features on this DVD include a section where you can select to workout without narration and you can view pictures of the postures.The 20-minute Yoga routines are very healing and especially fun. If you have 20-40 minutes you can get an excellent workout with added emotional benefits. I always feel spiritually cleansed and physically energized after a Sara Ivanhoe routine.

855005,A2D5ZYRQX2IMX5,B00049QQP0,R. Esposito,"[3, 3]","This is my favorite routine from Sara Ivanhoe's Yoga Makeover series (although my husband swears by the Flat Abs workout).This short, invigorating workout is a perfect practice for a busy schedule. It's a true 20 minutes.The routine consists of vinyasas with added arm movements to, supposedly, increase the calorie burn. Initially, these are fairly typical sequences: mountain to chair to forward bend to mountain, or chaturanga to up dog to down dog to chaturanga. But once things get rolling, Ivanhoe adds in extended leg (3-legged) down dogs and standing twists such as revolved crescent lunge and revolved triangle. I love standing poses and these additions allow me to push my edge in a short amount of time. A real treat!She ends the practice, rather abruptly, with just one quick seated stretch (single-legged forward bend) and a mudra. The mudra doesn't quite ""seal in the practice"" for me, so I usually do my own final relaxation.Ivanhoe has a warm, unaffected charm and doing her workouts is like practicing with a friend. Some video fitness enthusiasts have complained that her measured speech and use of colloquialisms appear condescending, but I just don't see it.

855006,ATKVDKXO3Q6ZM,B00049QQP0,Teedums,"[5, 5]","This is a nice yoga practice in 20 minutes, I often do this one in the mornings as I find that it's a good way to start the day, plus it's short and I can squeeze it in before work.  The title may have weight loss in it, but I don't think one should expect to lose weight with this routine.  It does however, increase the heartrate as you are constantly moving and not holding poses for very long, plus you are using a lot of arm movements.The scenery is very nice, I also like doing this video on days that I want to imagine that I am in a warmer climate.  It is very colorful and the yoga outfit that Sara is wearing seems to suit the background, which is the ocean and mountains in Hawaii.The routine does move pretty fast, especially when you are doing the vinyasa, but you perform enough times so you get lots of practice and eventually you will be able to keep up with Sara.  I like the flow of this routine, plus Sara will give you options for some of the poses to make them more challenging if choose.I would recommend this video for those already familiar with yoga, as there is really no demonstration of the poses and you do move fairly quickly.Sara Ivanhoe is my favorite yoga instructor, I have her Crunch yoga workouts and am glad that she has her own series.  I like her style of teaching and her approach towards yoga, which is non-intimidating.  She is friendly and light about it, not serious in anyway which is what I like.  I do yoga because I like to stretch and it's something different, she helps make it fun for me.
