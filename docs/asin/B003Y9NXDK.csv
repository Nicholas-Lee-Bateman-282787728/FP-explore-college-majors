If, however, you like to dwell in what the characters are saying with their eyes, feel the energy passing between the two characters and get wrapped up in the subtext of thoughts which the actors protray...then see/buy this film.Truly it is cinema in the European sense of the word.  Texture, depth and a spirit of humanity are elements that the director brings to play as the characters each find out who they are and what motivates them.  Coupled with a modern, nonchalant acceptance/ambivalence towards gay lifestyle in the film, the characters ultimately find themselves and realize their destinies.It is about time that a gay themed film finally has characters who don't hate themselves or act like ninny's. Also, it is refreshing to see a film where there is a happy ending with no one killing themselves or walking off into the sunset stoically.  More so the pity that our American directors can't bring to the screen anything close to what their European and South American counterparts have been presenting lately.

An amazingly complex matter we all go through many, many times in life. Skillfully directed and edited by the Argentinean first timer Marco Berger, the film is an emotional statement of sexual confusion, artistically created by a team of young dedicated and intelligent friends.  Two other amazing films comes to mind after watching this extraordinary work of art; Alexander Sokurov's Mother and Son and the young and talented Romanian Corneliu Porumboiu's Politist, Adjectiv.This film is not for everyone, but bright heterosexual people will find it very honest and even valuable.  You just do not know what will they do next and will question why are these two nice straight guys get it on? Because sexuality is complex by nature and societies made it even more difficult for them to express what they are feeling and Marco Berger knows that.  It seems like the Kinsey Scale is hard at work in this film, where the numbers they belong is keep shifting, but as a spectator, never for a moment lost interest or joy in the beautifully composed scenes especially when they are at sleep or just standing and waiting for something to happen naturally.  Your finger might be on the fast-forward side of the remote control, but if you are a true film lover ""you will not! touch that button.""  The joy and artistry are coming from these long, beautiful and important takes and cuts.  The film takes its time to let those feelings and expressions do the work, so we the audience get into the characters and almost feel their pain or joy.One has to be very ambitious and a fanatic Tarkovsky fan to be able to make this stunning expressionist film and Marco Berger, I suspect, is both.  I only recommend Plan B to hard-core film lovers and open-minded beautiful human beings, because the film will ask you to participate, will give you the space to be there with them and even examine your own feelings about this complex subject matters as sexuality, society and honesty.",5,"Honest, Touching, Profound and Beautiful film",1289001600,"11 6, 2010",2010,2072,"['Plan', 'B', 'captivating', 'movie', 'feelings', 'struggle', 'be', 'honest', 'least', 'yourself', 'amazingly', 'complex', 'matter', 'go', 'many', 'many', 'times', 'life', 'Skillfully', 'directed', 'edited', 'Argentinean', 'first', 'timer', 'Marco', 'Berger', 'film', 'emotional', 'statement', 'sexual', 'confusion', 'artistically', 'created', 'team', 'young', 'dedicated', 'intelligent', 'friends', 'Two', 'other', 'amazing', 'films', 'mind', 'watching', 'extraordinary', 'work', 'art', 'Alexander', 'Sokurov', 'Mother', 'Son', 'young', 'talented', 'Romanian', 'Corneliu', 'Porumboiu', 'Politist', 'Adjectiv.This', 'film', 'not', 'everyone', 'bright', 'heterosexual', 'people', 'will', 'find', 'very', 'honest', 'even', 'valuable', 'just', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'will', 'do', 'will', 'question', 'why', 'are', 'two', 'nice', 'straight', 'guys', 'get', 'sexuality', 'complex', 'nature', 'societies', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'difficult', 'express', 'what', 'are', 'feeling', 'Marco', 'Berger', 'Kinsey', 'Scale', 'hard', 'work', 'film', 'where', 'numbers', 'belong', 'keep', 'shifting', 'spectator', 'never', 'moment', 'lost', 'interest', 'joy', 'beautifully', 'composed', 'scenes', 'especially', 'when', 'are', 'sleep', 'just', 'standing', 'waiting', 'something', 'happen', 'naturally', 'finger', 'might', 'be', 'fast-forward', 'side', 'remote', 'control', 'are', 'true', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'touch', 'button', 'joy', 'artistry', 'are', 'coming', 'long', 'beautiful', 'important', 'cuts', 'film', 'time', 'let', 'feelings', 'expressions', 'do', 'work', 'audience', 'get', 'characters', 'almost', 'feel', 'pain', 'joy.One', 'be', 'very', 'ambitious', 'fanatic', 'Tarkovsky', 'fan', 'be', 'able', 'make', 'stunning', 'expressionist', 'film', 'Marco', 'Berger', 'suspect', 'only', 'recommend', 'Plan', 'B', 'hard-core', 'film', 'lovers', 'open-minded', 'beautiful', 'human', 'beings', 'film', 'will', 'ask', 'participate', 'will', 'give', 'space', 'be', 'there', 'even', 'examine', 'own', 'feelings', 'complex', 'subject', 'matters', 'sexuality', 'society', 'honesty']",Plan B

The seduction works too well, with consequences he had not anticipated.I don't expect a film about a concept such as sexual confusion to be quick and precise, but this film drags on with glacier-like pacing throughout.  It has numerous extraneous scenes that don't seem to contribute anything to the film, and the dialogue meanders even further, in between long periods of silence with characters staring as if in a daze.

When it did, we were two-thirds of the way through the film, and my interest had long since faded.The film techniques used, while artistic, made an already slow film even slower.  At times, the directors would cast the audience to watch a scene with nothing happening.

Bruno is jealous of his ex-girlfriend's new relationship (despite that they still see each other for recreational sex). In order to win her back, he plans to befriend her new boyfriend, Pablo, and find a way to destroy their relationship. Instead, the two men end up quickly developing a close friendship and then, to the complete surprise of both, fall in love.Much credit should go to the director, writer, and two lead actors of the film, because somehow the film manages to make the progression of the relationship between the two young men seem believable and natural. Despite Bruno's initial malicious intentions toward befriending Pablo, when the two start spending time together, their relationship has an innocent, almost childlike, quality to it. The two share the unguarded, intimate closeness that many same-sex close friendships in childhood and youth do. The two talk about their favorite childhood toys, have sleepovers, take photos of one another, and just hang out together in the unhurried way that young people do.Unlike most gay themed American films, the film doesn't feel the need to include gratuitous nudity or simulated sex scenes. Instead, the film depicts the characters finding emotional intimacy, which leads to a slow, hesitant exploration of romantic feelings.

1376012,A8QG61LYK0XO1,B003Y9NXDK,JUST A REVIEWER2,"[32, 35]","Yo.....let me get something out of the way right up front. If you don't think the ending 4 minute scene makes your viewing time more than worth it, then I'll eat my ticket stub, AND tell you that you're not the gay romantic you'd like to think you are.The Big Question addressed by this movie is....Will ""Plan B"" backfire?  And since we're given seemingly ""Dyed in the Wool"" Hetereos as our 2 leads, it's a valid one.  Just know, however, that this viewer has never seen a ""straight guys falling for each other"" story which felt and seemed more real than this (well, maybe in novels).  And what really stumps me is HOW they got such intangible feelings to come across on film!  That's a Biggie.  Now a WARNING:  Don't be mislead by viewers who say nothing ""seems"" to be happening in this movie.  The fact is, for most of us, it'll take time to sink in that IT has been happening right before our eyes all along; we just weren't ""recognizing"" it.  So when several of those long (in time taken) shots occur, showing one or another of our leads standing alone, staring off into space....or sitting by himself, gazing at nothing......BUT then this silly smile starts to appear on his face.....or you hear the guy start whispering funny or surprised little comments to himself......THEN is when you pick up on what all this is about.  You suddenly realize what these two are thinking and agonizing over:  ""What's the hell's happening to me?"".......""How come I'm feeling this way?"".......""No way this can be real!"".......""Well, what the F--- do I do now?!""So, with all that out of the way, here's a little bit of what your having been patient will bring you:  There's a written confession of love.....there's a face to face admission of love.  There's some hurt.....there's some tears.  And, as already mentioned, you'll witness lots of feelings expressed in just a look.....or in the manner a character is standing or sitting during his alone time.  So, Viewers, don't rush this.  Your Director intended for you to be as patient as are his 2 characters (even if that does cause them confusion along the way).  But, in the end, you'll be happy to know:  We CAN see it.....Falling in Love.....oh, yes we can.Not everything is perfect; there are things I think wrong with this film.  However, most of them have to do with a lack of resources to produce a top-grade production. This young and talented (cute, too) writer / director likely did the best he could with what he had. Foremost problem is a lack of inviting surroundings in which to shoot---especially an important waterfront ""getting to know one another"" scene---which takes place in an abandoned industrial area of crumbling cement, rusting metal and weed growth. Sadly, those surroundings undermine the relationship development such a scene is aiming for. Still, it does remind us that our 2 lead characters are not upscale, wealthy types (and their living quarters reflect that, as well).Speaking of the leads (Manuel Vignau and Lucas Ferraro).....if you begin by thinking these 2 are mere eye candy, they'll have you right where they want you---squirming for ""IT"" to happen. What's ""IT"" you ask?  Duh, c'mon, be honest; you came into this thing thinking, ""Oooh, 2 straights falling for each other."" Sure ya did.  And along the way you may just start to notice that these guys play off each other wonderfully---which is no small thing if a film is to be memorable. (Even though a low budget Indie, the DVD Special Features interviews of both actors show them to be quite well-spoken and certainly well aware of what they needed to do to get the point of this story across to us).PS--So, the Moral of this tale is that:  Yes, you can have a Backup Plan (""B"") in place for a first attempt that goes wrong.  BUT keep in mind that, if the situation involves love... jealousy...getting-back-at....and if it results in deviousness or hurtfulness toward another person, then you may find out the hard way that ""B"" can also stand for ""B""ackfire or ""B""oomerang.  Which is not to say, Dear Viewer, that LOVE can't be the end result.(( I've revised this review and in doing so am adding this following comment about the film. I've come to find it strangely surprising that these 2 actors have REALLY grown on me, and that I want to watch and rewatch them. Sure, one's kind of an idiot at the beginning....until an ""earthquake"" hits him, and you begin to see him differently. And the other lead....well, Wow, the tears he is brought to suddenly become the tears you share. And sure, sometimes I fast-forward through scenes not mainly involving them, but that's only because I want them back. So, there you have it. ))For your viewing pleasure, why not take a look at a few recent gems:  ""Ciao"" // ""Just Say Love"" // ""Eyes Wide Open"" // ""Patrik Age 1.5""",4,Worth it for the last 4 minutes alone....or I'll........,1285027200,"09 21, 2010",2010,4795,"['Yo', '..let', 'get', 'something', 'way', 'right', 'up', 'front', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'ending', '4', 'minute', 'scene', 'viewing', 'time', 'more', 'worth', 'then', ""'ll"", 'eat', 'ticket', 'stub', 'AND', 'tell', ""'re"", 'not', 'gay', 'romantic', ""'d"", 'like', 'think', 'are.The', 'Big', 'Question', 'addressed', 'movie', '.Will', 'Plan', 'B', 'backfire', ""'re"", 'given', 'seemingly', 'Dyed', 'Wool', 'Hetereos', '2', 'leads', 'valid', 'one', 'Just', 'know', 'however', 'viewer', 'never', 'seen', 'straight', 'guys', 'falling', 'other', 'story', 'felt', 'seemed', 'more', 'real', 'well', 'maybe', 'novels', 'what', 'really', 'stumps', 'HOW', 'got', 'such', 'intangible', 'feelings', 'come', 'film', 'Biggie', 'Now', 'WARNING', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'mislead', 'viewers', 'who', 'say', 'nothing', 'be', 'happening', 'movie', 'fact', 'most', ""'ll"", 'take', 'time', 'sink', 'IT', 'been', 'happening', 'right', 'eyes', 'along', 'just', 'were', ""n't"", 'recognizing', 'So', 'when', 'several', 'long', 'time', 'taken', 'shots', 'occur', 'showing', 'one', 'leads', 'standing', 'alone', 'staring', 'off', 'space', 'sitting', 'gazing', 'nothing', 'BUT', 'then', 'silly', 'smile', 'starts', 'appear', 'face', 'hear', 'guy', 'start', 'whispering', 'funny', 'surprised', 'little', 'comments', 'THEN', 'when', 'pick', 'up', 'what', 'about', 'suddenly', 'realize', 'what', 'two', 'are', 'thinking', 'agonizing', 'What', 'hell', 'happening', 'How', 'come', ""'m"", 'feeling', 'way', 'way', 'can', 'be', 'real', 'Well', 'what', 'F', 'do', 'do', 'now', 'So', 'way', 'here', 'little', 'bit', 'what', 'having', 'been', 'patient', 'will', 'bring', 'written', 'confession', 'love', 'face', 'face', 'admission', 'love', 'hurt', 'tears', 'already', 'mentioned', ""'ll"", 'witness', 'lots', 'feelings', 'expressed', 'just', 'look', '..or', 'manner', 'character', 'standing', 'sitting', 'alone', 'time', 'So', 'Viewers', 'do', ""n't"", 'rush', 'Director', 'intended', 'be', 'as', 'patient', 'are', '2', 'characters', 'even', 'cause', 'confusion', 'way', 'end', ""'ll"", 'be', 'happy', 'know', 'CAN', 'see', '..Falling', 'Love', '..oh', 'yes', 'can.Not', 'everything', 'perfect', 'are', 'things', 'think', 'wrong', 'film', 'However', 'most', 'have', 'do', 'lack', 'resources', 'produce', 'top-grade', 'production', 'young', 'talented', 'cute', 'too', 'writer', '/', 'director', 'likely', 'did', 'best', 'could', 'what', 'had', 'Foremost', 'problem', 'lack', 'inviting', 'surroundings', 'shoot', '-especially', 'important', 'waterfront', 'getting', 'know', 'one', 'scene', '-which', 'place', 'abandoned', 'industrial', 'area', 'crumbling', 'cement', 'rusting', 'metal', 'weed', 'growth', 'Sadly', 'surroundings', 'undermine', 'relationship', 'development', 'scene', 'aiming', 'Still', 'remind', '2', 'lead', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'upscale', 'wealthy', 'types', 'living', 'quarters', 'reflect', 'as', 'well', '.Speaking', 'leads', 'Manuel', 'Vignau', 'Lucas', 'Ferraro', '..if', 'begin', 'thinking', '2', 'are', 'mere', 'eye', 'candy', ""'ll"", 'have', 'right', 'where', 'want', '-squirming', 'IT', 'happen', 'What', 'IT', 'ask', 'Duh', ""c'mon"", 'be', 'honest', 'came', 'thing', 'thinking', 'Oooh', '2', 'straights', 'falling', 'other', 'Sure', 'ya', 'did', 'way', 'may', 'just', 'start', 'notice', 'guys', 'play', 'off', 'other', 'wonderfully', '-which', 'small', 'thing', 'film', 'be', 'memorable', 'Even', 'low', 'budget', 'Indie', 'DVD', 'Special', 'Features', 'interviews', 'actors', 'show', 'be', 'quite', 'well-spoken', 'certainly', 'well', 'aware', 'what', 'needed', 'do', 'get', 'point', 'story', '.PS', 'So', 'Moral', 'tale', 'Yes', 'can', 'have', 'Backup', 'Plan', 'B', 'place', 'first', 'attempt', 'wrong', 'BUT', 'keep', 'mind', 'situation', 'love', 'jealousy', 'getting-back-at', '.and', 'results', 'deviousness', 'hurtfulness', 'person', 'then', 'may', 'find', 'out', 'hard', 'way', 'B', 'can', 'also', 'stand', 'B', 'ackfire', 'B', 'oomerang', 'Which', 'not', 'say', 'Dear', 'Viewer', 'LOVE', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'end', 'result', ""'ve"", 'revised', 'review', 'doing', 'so', 'am', 'adding', 'following', 'comment', 'film', ""'ve"", 'come', 'find', 'strangely', 'surprising', '2', 'actors', 'have', 'REALLY', 'grown', 'want', 'watch', 'rewatch', 'Sure', 'one', 'kind', 'idiot', 'beginning', 'earthquake', 'begin', 'see', 'differently', 'other', 'lead', '.well', 'Wow', 'tears', 'brought', 'suddenly', 'become', 'tears', 'share', 'sure', 'sometimes', 'fast-forward', 'scenes', 'not', 'mainly', 'involving', 'only', 'want', 'back', 'So', 'have', 'viewing', 'pleasure', 'why', 'not', 'take', 'look', 'few', 'recent', 'gems', 'Ciao', 'Just', 'Say', 'Love', '//', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Open', '//', 'Patrik', 'Age', '1.5']",Plan B

Marco Berger's work with actors is phenomenal - the performances in this film are so complex and honest it takes your breath away.  He's a master at sexual tension (he even titles his last set of short films that) --the silent spaces where people don't understand or can't define the feelings they have (but know they have them).  Also his subject matter, or themes as you might have it are controversial in both a gay and straight context. He's interested in the gray area, where gay desires are often unlocked in straight men - which lead to mental torture because they conflict with all the values these men have taken for granted. So here we have a gay film about straight guys. How realistic can that be? Well, as it turns out, very. It's also a love story that shows how difficult it is to recognize what you feel, and the marvelous vibes that can naturally exist between two kindred souls --in other words, the real thing. Seldom do we see films that exhibit such affection and tenderness for their characters--oh yes, you can hear the nay-sayers--From straights: &#34; Talk about gay fantasy. Oh brother&#34;  From gays: &#34; Where's the nudity and sex?&#34;.  But for those of you who want to enjoy a real love story, you won't object, you'll be thrilled.  Berger has a more somber version of the same themes in his prize winning, Absent. And his last has been a series of short films, which excel in fine performances and well...sexual tension.

The plan, of course backfires when Pablo discovers what Bruno is up to and Bruno discovers he is falling in love.The actors are great, and there is a nice chemistry between Vignau and Ferraro.Being a foreign movie the film moves at a leisurely pace, but that's okay with me.  One drawback is that there is very little dialogue.  Many of the scenes are played in near silence which is effective up to a point.  Vignau and Ferraro do a very good job communicating their feelings through facial expressions and body language.  The problem is that the lack of dialogue leads to a lot of confusion, at least for me.  I couldn't even figure out who the girlfriend was until the film was almost over (I thought she was the neighbor).  I guess I wasn't paying enough attention.
