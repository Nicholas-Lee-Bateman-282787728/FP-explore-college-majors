275888,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,6301964306,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[11, 13]","One of the best things about this epic based on Alexander the Great is watching and listening to Richard Burton ply his magnificent craft. He was 29 at the time this film was made, and his resonant voice is remarkable, and one of the most unique sounds to be heard in the cinema. He is unfortunately wearing a strawberry blonde wig that has so much spray on it, it could be made of plastic, but otherwise makes a marvelous Alexander, in one of his rare appearances in an ""ancient costume epic"", others being ""The Robe"" and the infamous ""Cleopatra"".Written, directed and produced by Robert Rossen, it has some excellent dialogue, overall fine acting, and of course, battle sequences with 1001 extras. There is also quite a bit of ""beefcake"", but not many who are ready for the bare chest exposure, including Burton, whose abs are almost absent, and many of the extras are flabby and rotund, and hard to imagine are warriors.Shot on location in Spain, the cinematography by Robert Krasner, in typical '50s vibrant Technicolor, is wonderful. Claire Bloom is beautiful as Barsine, a dark and hairy, savage and quite unrecognizable Frederick March is terrific as Philip of Macedon, Harry Andrews is a good Darius, and Danielle Darrieux is Alexander's crafty mother. Others of note in the cast are Stanley Baker as Attalus, and Peter Cushing as Memnon.Though flawed, this is a film that can be viewed repeatedly, for its well written scenes, Burton's acting, and a smattering of history as well, which is condensed and altered to fit the Hollywood format, but has some basis in truth; it is also fascinating to note that if one listens carefully, one will hear things reminiscent of recent news stories; history seems to be a wheel that is ever turning, and for the brief time that Alexander was in power, he would say ""The world is my domain, and my mission is to rule it and rebuild it"".Total running time is 136 minutes, and the DVD extra is the original theatrical trailer.",4,"""The world is my domain""",1109894400,"03 4, 2005",2005,1971,"['One', 'best', 'things', 'epic', 'based', 'Alexander', 'Great', 'watching', 'listening', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'ply', 'magnificent', 'craft', 'was', '29', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'resonant', 'voice', 'remarkable', 'one', 'most', 'unique', 'sounds', 'be', 'heard', 'cinema', 'unfortunately', 'wearing', 'strawberry', 'blonde', 'wig', 'so', 'much', 'spray', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'plastic', 'otherwise', 'marvelous', 'Alexander', 'one', 'rare', 'appearances', 'ancient', 'costume', 'epic', 'others', 'being', 'Robe', 'infamous', 'Cleopatra', '.Written', 'directed', 'produced', 'Robert', 'Rossen', 'excellent', 'dialogue', 'overall', 'fine', 'acting', 'course', 'battle', 'sequences', '1001', 'extras', 'also', 'quite', 'bit', 'beefcake', 'not', 'many', 'who', 'are', 'ready', 'bare', 'chest', 'exposure', 'including', 'Burton', 'abs', 'are', 'almost', 'absent', 'many', 'extras', 'are', 'flabby', 'rotund', 'hard', 'imagine', 'are', 'warriors.Shot', 'location', 'Spain', 'cinematography', 'Robert', 'Krasner', 'typical', ""'50s"", 'vibrant', 'Technicolor', 'wonderful', 'Claire', 'Bloom', 'beautiful', 'Barsine', 'dark', 'hairy', 'savage', 'quite', 'unrecognizable', 'Frederick', 'March', 'terrific', 'Philip', 'Macedon', 'Harry', 'Andrews', 'good', 'Darius', 'Danielle', 'Darrieux', 'Alexander', 'crafty', 'mother', 'Others', 'note', 'cast', 'are', 'Stanley', 'Baker', 'Attalus', 'Peter', 'Cushing', 'Memnon.Though', 'flawed', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'repeatedly', 'well', 'written', 'scenes', 'Burton', 'acting', 'smattering', 'history', 'well', 'condensed', 'altered', 'fit', 'Hollywood', 'format', 'basis', 'truth', 'also', 'fascinating', 'note', 'one', 'carefully', 'one', 'will', 'hear', 'things', 'reminiscent', 'recent', 'news', 'stories', 'history', 'be', 'wheel', 'ever', 'turning', 'brief', 'time', 'Alexander', 'was', 'power', 'would', 'say', 'world', 'domain', 'mission', 'rule', 'rebuild', '.Total', 'running', 'time', '136', 'minutes', 'DVD', 'extra', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer']",Alexander the Great VHS

He over acted some parts too much and some parts not enough. I liked watching the guy who plays Philip much more. He seemed to really get into his character and made him work for the time that he was in the film.The battle scenes are anemic compared to what we're used to today and even for that time I think left a bit to be desired in that realm. The dialogue could be a bit silly in places and odd in some other parts.I would say, and this had it going for it, it's no worse than the modern version of Alexander with Colin Farrell.

275890,A2SHF3F8N7HGS3,6301964306,"Allen Eaton ""aleaton3""","[10, 11]","I have recently rented or purchased so-called ""remastered"" films on DVD and have frequently been very disappointed.  For instance, ""Pope Joan"" (1972) starring Liv Ullman, and ""Third Man On The Mountain"" (1959) starring James MacArthur.  Both are terrible film/disc transfers, with scratches, dirt and no color correction.  So, I shuddered to think what ""Alexander the Great"" would look like.  To my surprise, and enjoyment, the DVD transfer is very good, with excellent Surround sound.  The picture image (widescreen, 2:35.1) is free of dirt, scratches and distortion.That said, the film is . . . well, what it is.  You can't go back and remake this particular version with this cast.  So, we're stuck with making the best tranfer we can with what we've got.I heard that Burton disclaimed his performance because he so strongly disagreed with Robert Rossen's approach.  He was probably right.  You can see patches of a potentially good film, but Rossen's approach (plodding and episodic), with rough, patchy editing, destroys what vision he may have started with.  Characters come and go so frequently that it's hard to keep up without a playbill in your lap.  This is because Rossen told Alexander's ENTIRE life story, from birth to death. That's a lot of history, not to mention people,  to absorb in just over 2 hours.Very good actors are given only limited screen time.  These seasoned character actors do the best with what they've got, but writer Rossen generally gives them only a thumb-nail sketch of their characters, people who are central to Alexander's life. I get the sense that this is the Reader's Digest version of a much longer movie.Also, every scene feels exactly like the previous one.  Rossen's direction is simple, mechanical and workman-like.  Burton doesn't seem to ""grow"" into the role (but this, again, may be the result of choppy editing).  I am reminded that Burton's performance as Antony in ""Cleopatra"" (1963) was generally panned, but there was a situation where the director was forced by the studio to cut 2 1/2 hours, most of which turned out to be of Burton. Burton's REAL performance as Antony is lying around . . . somewhere.  It would be nice to see it.The rssult (in ""Anexander"" as in ""Cleopatra"") is that Burton looks mechanical; he sounds the same at the end as he did in the beginning.  It is also true to say that Burton's acting style at this time was generally very much effected and way over-the-top.  (Look at the DVD of his Hamlet peformance on Broaway 8 years after ""Alexander).Of course, we can vetch and vetch till Doombsday, but at least the DVD transfer is wholly satisfactory in preserving this interesting piece of movie history.",4,Good Looking DVD,1099526400,"11 4, 2004",2004,2684,"['have', 'recently', 'rented', 'purchased', 'so-called', 'remastered', 'films', 'DVD', 'have', 'frequently', 'been', 'very', 'disappointed', 'instance', 'Pope', 'Joan', '1972', 'starring', 'Liv', 'Ullman', 'Third', 'Man', 'Mountain', '1959', 'starring', 'James', 'MacArthur', 'are', 'terrible', 'film/disc', 'transfers', 'scratches', 'dirt', 'color', 'correction', 'So', 'shuddered', 'think', 'what', 'Alexander', 'Great', 'would', 'look', 'surprise', 'enjoyment', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'very', 'good', 'excellent', 'Surround', 'sound', 'picture', 'image', 'widescreen', '2:35.1', 'free', 'dirt', 'scratches', 'distortion.That', 'said', 'film', 'well', 'what', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'back', 'remake', 'particular', 'version', 'cast', 'So', ""'re"", 'stuck', 'making', 'best', 'tranfer', 'can', 'what', ""'ve"", 'got.I', 'heard', 'Burton', 'disclaimed', 'performance', 'so', 'strongly', 'disagreed', 'Robert', 'Rossen', 'approach', 'was', 'probably', 'right', 'can', 'see', 'patches', 'potentially', 'good', 'film', 'Rossen', 'approach', 'plodding', 'episodic', 'rough', 'patchy', 'editing', 'what', 'vision', 'may', 'have', 'started', 'Characters', 'come', 'go', 'so', 'frequently', 'hard', 'keep', 'up', 'playbill', 'lap', 'Rossen', 'told', 'Alexander', 'ENTIRE', 'life', 'story', 'birth', 'death', 'lot', 'history', 'not', 'mention', 'people', 'absorb', 'just', '2', 'hours.Very', 'good', 'actors', 'are', 'given', 'only', 'limited', 'screen', 'time', 'seasoned', 'character', 'actors', 'do', 'best', 'what', ""'ve"", 'got', 'writer', 'Rossen', 'generally', 'only', 'thumb-nail', 'sketch', 'characters', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'central', 'Alexander', 'life', 'get', 'sense', 'Reader', 'Digest', 'version', 'much', 'longer', 'movie.Also', 'scene', 'exactly', 'previous', 'one', 'Rossen', 'direction', 'simple', 'mechanical', 'workman-like', 'Burton', ""n't"", 'seem', 'grow', 'role', 'again', 'may', 'be', 'result', 'choppy', 'editing', 'am', 'reminded', 'Burton', 'performance', 'Antony', 'Cleopatra', '1963', 'was', 'generally', 'panned', 'there', 'was', 'situation', 'where', 'director', 'was', 'forced', 'studio', 'cut', '2', '1/2', 'hours', 'most', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'Burton', 'Burton', 'REAL', 'performance', 'Antony', 'lying', 'around', 'somewhere', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'see', 'it.The', 'rssult', 'Anexander', 'Cleopatra', 'Burton', 'mechanical', 'same', 'end', 'did', 'beginning', 'also', 'true', 'say', 'Burton', 'acting', 'style', 'time', 'was', 'generally', 'very', 'much', 'effected', 'way', 'over-the-top', 'Look', 'DVD', 'Hamlet', 'peformance', 'Broaway', '8', 'years', 'Alexander', '.Of', 'course', 'can', 'vetch', 'vetch', 'till', 'Doombsday', 'least', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'wholly', 'satisfactory', 'preserving', 'interesting', 'piece', 'movie', 'history']",Alexander the Great VHS
275891,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6301964306,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","Alexander the Great is easily one of the most fascinating historical figures.  Because of that, his life is something that has been the subject of portrayal many times over, whether it be film or book or theater.  Sadly, because of the epicness of his existence, despite his short lifespan, his story is a difficult one to tell.  Even with all the passion and good intentions, the finished product often feels stuffy and cold and not entirely convincing.  There are just so many aspects, so many points, and touching upon them all (which is what many filmmakers attempt to do) overwhelms, and not in a good way.Yes, this is the stuff epics were made of, but maybe someone should try and scale it back a little.This 1956 tale is, like most others, a grand depiction of Alexander&#8217;s life, from birth to death, but there is something about Robert Rossen&#8217;s direction that makes this all feel more grounded and effective than the others have.  With nicely composed war sequences kept for special moments and not thrust in the forefront, we are given a nicely developed emotional journey of a man torn between his fleshly existence and his belief in his own deity.  Liberties were obviously taken, as with all films of this nature, and yet they never distract.  Burton, one of the greatest actors of any generation, feels slightly miscast at times, and the climax gets a little muddy, but Rossen&#8217;s obvious attachment to the material shows in the best possible ways, and Fredric March, completely unrecognizable under all that makeup, delivers a scene stealing performance that will leave you wanting more.  It&#8217;s a beautiful film, with stunning cinematography and some lavish sets and costumes, and the earthy, emotional core makes this one of the better more inspired takes on this legacy.",4,The man behind the legend&#8230;,1400544000,"05 20, 2014",2014,1806,"['Great', 'easily', 'one', 'most', 'fascinating', 'historical', 'figures', 'life', 'something', 'been', 'subject', 'portrayal', 'many', 'times', 'be', 'film', 'book', 'theater', 'Sadly', 'epicness', 'existence', 'short', 'lifespan', 'story', 'difficult', 'one', 'tell', 'Even', 'passion', 'good', 'intentions', 'finished', 'product', 'often', 'feels', 'stuffy', 'cold', 'not', 'entirely', 'convincing', 'are', 'just', 'so', 'many', 'aspects', 'so', 'many', 'points', 'touching', 'what', 'many', 'filmmakers', 'attempt', 'do', 'overwhelms', 'not', 'good', 'way.Yes', 'stuff', 'epics', 'were', 'made', 'maybe', 'someone', 'should', 'try', 'scale', 'back', 'little.This', '1956', 'tale', 'most', 'others', 'grand', 'depiction', 'Alexander', '8217', 's', 'life', 'birth', 'death', 'something', 'Robert', 'Rossen', '8217', 'direction', 'feel', 'more', 'grounded', 'effective', 'others', 'have', 'nicely', 'composed', 'war', 'sequences', 'kept', 'special', 'moments', 'not', 'thrust', 'forefront', 'are', 'given', 'nicely', 'developed', 'emotional', 'journey', 'man', 'torn', 'fleshly', 'existence', 'belief', 'own', 'deity', 'Liberties', 'were', 'obviously', 'taken', 'films', 'nature', 'yet', 'never', 'distract', 'Burton', 'one', 'greatest', 'actors', 'generation', 'feels', 'slightly', 'miscast', 'times', 'climax', 'little', 'muddy', 'Rossen', '8217', 'obvious', 'attachment', 'material', 'best', 'possible', 'ways', 'Fredric', 'March', 'completely', 'unrecognizable', 'makeup', 'scene', 'stealing', 'performance', 'will', 'leave', 'wanting', 'more', '8217', 's', 'beautiful', 'film', 'stunning', 'cinematography', 'lavish', 'sets', 'costumes', 'earthy', 'emotional', 'core', 'one', 'better', 'more', 'inspired', 'legacy']",Alexander the Great VHS
275892,A1PASRZ81DY9C,6301964306,Austin Somlo,"[4, 5]","Viewed: 3/09Rate: 43/09: Alexander the Great, although much better than Oliver Stone's version, is a very flat picture with neither the imagination nor the excitement of Braveheart. Save a few elements, it doesn't even compare with Ben-Hur or The Ten Commandments. Richard Burton holds on his own very well, but I am disappointed that he had to work with inferior material. The cast is good, but stale performances abound. I hadn't recognized Peter Cushing as Memnon until the ending credits, and I did like his hair. As for the film, the rivalry between Alexander and Philip is interesting but too unconvincing. The best parts of Alexander the Great, aside from Richard Burton, are the costumes and the backgrounds including the architecture. They really looked great. I wish I could say the same of the battle scenes; they looked pitifully bad and mediocre, lacking realism. The biggest advantage of Alexander the Great has over Alexander is that the former is never loquacious. That was the reason how I survived the film where Alexander just put me to dead sleep within minutes. However, the dialogues of Alexander the Great need more sharpening in terms of wit, relevance, and power. All in all, I've thought about giving a `5' for Alexander the Great with occasional thinking of `6', but the last twenty minutes of the movie firmly sealed my opinion due to the increasingly boredom. Upon reading the trivia page of IMDB, Charlton Heston, turning down Richard Burton's role, makes a great point by saying, ""Alexander is the easiest kind of picture to make badly.""

275893,ANGH6401L9Y0T,6301964306,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[1, 5]","I didn't understand this movie very well. Indeed, I got so lost that when it was over, I went to Wikipedia and read about the life of Alexander before I thought I could write this review properly. But I can tell you one thing which I did pick up from the movie, and which was confirmed by Wikipedia. This movie was a gay man's dream. All those healthy young specimens, very scantily clad, wrestling and doing all sorts of gymnastics! Oh, my! And in fact even Richard Burton, playing Alexander, was convincingly gay. (Forget that he later married Liz Taylor; he was an ACTOR, after all. He could be anything he wanted, anything the script called for.)As mentioned, Richard Burton plays Alexander, and does a reasonably good job. I have not looked up the specifics, but he must have been pretty young at the time. Either he was not quite the actor he became later or the director wanted him to be enigmatic, because he shows very little emotion in his facial expressions. Fredric March plays Philip of Macedonia, his father, and Claire Bloom his ambitious and rather ruthless mother Olympias, with whom he had quite an enduring attachment. She said that a god was born when she gave birth to Alexander, and indeed both she and Philip had prophetic dreams about him. The soothsayers agreed, but then soothsayers generally knew which side of the bread was buttered.The first we see Alexander as an adult, or nearly so, is the scene with all those buffed young men. Aristotle is his teacher, and it would not be too much to say that it was Aristotle who was really responsible for Alexander's greatness, in that it seems Alexander took his advice quite seriously.When Philip goes off to conquer Greece, he leaves Alexander in charge as his regent in Macedonia. But it seems he did rather too good a job; Philip developed quite a jealousy of Alexander which caused some trouble. Just before Philip was killed, he ordered several of Alexander's closest companions into exile. However, he was killed by an angry young man on the steps of the temple before the exile was carried out. It seems Olympias hinted to the young man. Alexander overheard the conversation and did not approve, but later on the steps of the temple, Philip tells Alexander to go ahead of him, that he will walk alone. Since Alexander had already spotted the would-be assassin in the crowd, his agreement to walk ahead of Philip probably seemed like permission to the assassin. After Philip was dead, Alexander killed the assassin. To prove he had no part of it, or to shut him up before he could say anything about Olympias? Who knows?Alexander had to conquer Greece all over again, because they rebelled, and then went on to conquer the Persian empire, which included Judea, Egypt and Mesopotamia, as well as the turf in between. While in Egypt, he founded Alexandria, later the seat of the Ptolemaic dynasty which ruled Egypt when Cleopatra ruled Marc Antony. (Burton revisited?)Then he went on to India, but eventually drew back, as it was just too much for him. He left some of his men in control and returned over the desert. (Wasn't clear where he returned to, but it was green, not desert.)In Persia, Alexander adopted Persian dress and customs, which made a lot of his Greek and Macedonian followers mad. He attempted to unite the two empires peacefully by marrying a Persian princess and also arranging a huge mass marriage like Sun Moon with his officers and Persian women. Not long after that, he got sick and died. On his deathbed, his officers asked him to whom he left his empire, and he answered, ""to the strongest.""If you like lots of battle and all that, or if you are fond of ancient history, you will probably like this film. As I said above, I did not understand it very well, and never got so far as to sort out the names to go with the faces of most of the main characters.

275894,A2Z28WKY1LHBKY,6301964306,"blockhed ""blockhed""","[3, 4]","But difficult to call good. The actors are good, but have crummy lines to speak and are poorly directed. It seems a waste, since one is left with a feeling that with greater creative imagination and more dynamic direction this could have been an effective film. The look of it is heavily dated, with the costumes far too bright and clean-looking all the time, and the style is generally very theatrical. Nothing convinces: certainly not the battles; and the way the scenes are shot is mostly plain dull. It also seems to jump about in a jerky manner, especially in the later scenes: probably it had been heavily cut down by someone with minimal sense of pacing. It would be nice, some time, to see a film where someone had taken the trouble to deeply immerse himself in the way people truly lived, thought, spoke and interacted in Ancient Greece. I could never quite believe what I was seeing here. Nevertheless, there is something memorable about the movie, and I think it must simply be down to the presence, voice and look of Burton, in spite of his back-combed strawberry blond rug and fake tan. Every now and then you suspect that, given a director with a tauter, clearer vision and more drive, he might have produced an Alexander to match the legend.

275896,A2TJWNRBBU82FQ,6301964306,Cowboy Buddha,"[7, 9]","Someday, someone is going to make a great film about Alexander. Writer/director Robert Rossen took a crack at it in the mid-1950's, an era of epic films. The result was interesting but ultimately disappointing. Perhaps Rossen tried to squeeze too much into a standard running time. Some scenes, usually the historic ones, seem rushed and truncated while others, the fictionalised ones, seem superfluous. Visually, the film is quite good. In fact, it is one of those films where the stills are more impressive than the actual scenes.But Rossen obviously wanted to make an ""intelligent"" epic. Some of the script and casting reflect that. The supporting cast has a number of respected British thesps -Claire Bloom, Harry Andrews, Peter Cushing, Michael Hordern, Stanley Baker. But there are also a lot of Italians whose dialogue is dubbed by those same two guys who did all the film dubbing in the 1950's. One can only wonder who chose Fredric March (hammy as ever) as Philip of Macedon or Danielle Darrieux (who apparently had only one facial expression) as his mischievous queen.But the critical casting was Richard Burton as Alexander. He certainly looks the part, despite the blonde hair. But he frequently suffers from his career-long inability to adapt his stage-acting technique to the more intimate demands of cinema. Or maybe that's how he thought a wannabe god should behave. You sit there praying for him to lighten up - just a little.For the rest, the many battle scenes tend to be confusing rather than spectacular, the uncertain pace suggests a lot of pre-release cuts were made, and the music not only sounds primitive but seems to have been recorded in somebody's basement. Still, the film is an interesting failure. But you end up admiring its ambitions more than its results.",3,An Epic That Never Was,1022716800,"05 30, 2002",2002,1790,"['Someday', 'someone', 'going', 'make', 'great', 'film', 'Alexander', 'Writer/director', 'Robert', 'Rossen', 'took', 'crack', 'mid-1950', 'era', 'epic', 'films', 'result', 'was', 'interesting', 'ultimately', 'disappointing', 'Perhaps', 'Rossen', 'tried', 'squeeze', 'too', 'much', 'standard', 'running', 'time', 'scenes', 'usually', 'historic', 'ones', 'seem', 'rushed', 'truncated', 'others', 'fictionalised', 'ones', 'seem', 'superfluous', 'Visually', 'film', 'quite', 'good', 'fact', 'one', 'films', 'where', 'stills', 'are', 'more', 'impressive', 'actual', 'scenes.But', 'Rossen', 'obviously', 'wanted', 'make', 'intelligent', 'epic', 'script', 'casting', 'reflect', 'supporting', 'cast', 'number', 'respected', 'British', 'thesps', '-Claire', 'Bloom', 'Harry', 'Andrews', 'Peter', 'Cushing', 'Michael', 'Hordern', 'Stanley', 'Baker', 'are', 'also', 'lot', 'Italians', 'dialogue', 'dubbed', 'same', 'two', 'guys', 'who', 'did', 'film', 'dubbing', '1950', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'wonder', 'who', 'chose', 'Fredric', 'March', 'hammy', 'ever', 'Philip', 'Macedon', 'Danielle', 'Darrieux', 'who', 'apparently', 'had', 'only', 'one', 'facial', 'expression', 'mischievous', 'critical', 'casting', 'was', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'Alexander', 'certainly', 'part', 'blonde', 'hair', 'frequently', 'career-long', 'inability', 'adapt', 'stage-acting', 'technique', 'more', 'intimate', 'demands', 'cinema', 'maybe', 'how', 'thought', 'wannabe', 'god', 'should', 'behave', 'sit', 'praying', 'lighten', 'up', 'just', 'little.For', 'rest', 'many', 'battle', 'scenes', 'tend', 'be', 'confusing', 'rather', 'spectacular', 'uncertain', 'pace', 'lot', 'pre-release', 'cuts', 'were', 'made', 'music', 'not', 'only', 'primitive', 'have', 'been', 'recorded', 'somebody', 'basement', 'Still', 'film', 'interesting', 'failure', 'end', 'up', 'admiring', 'ambitions', 'more', 'results']",Alexander the Great VHS

I purchased and viewed this today, Oct. 27th. 04. It is not my intention to give this a detailed review as has been done at lenght eleswhere. Not my style anyway.To write about Greek or Roman history/heros with all the factions and diverse warring rulers of those times is tedious at best. And a hard subject to put into a screenplay, to breathe the least. However this is a literate screenplay and all the players are mentioned, just a bit hard to follow unless you've read your Will Durant. Not just another popcorn flick.No, I just want to say that if anyone is thinking of buying this DVD, I don't think you'd be disappointed, providing you love all the Hollywood epics of the 50's. If you do you may want this one too! Not the spectacle of Quo Vadis, Ben Hur, King of Kings or the pagentry of Cleopatra, but a worthy entry none the less. Matte paintings used in all aforementioned used here as well, but not as many. The Babalonian City is extraordinary and enough glass paintings to convey an epic, unlike the claustrophobic Spartacus. The sets are somewhat meger, like Spartacus, but what lacks there is made up for in the use of Technicolor and Cinemascope and the absolutely remarkable and stunning wardrobe. This is a terrific transfer and will look even better on your 16 x 9 HDTV! The 480 that DVD's put out look as though you might reach for that goblet on wine on the table.Spain seems to double well for Greece and Persia and although the battles were not of the rousing kind, one over looks this as a trade off to the overall movie. This film also doesn't have that ''Hollywood touch'' of the others of the 50's and seems more adult for that reason {Barabbas 61' is another}.So if you're looking for  another great but not Great 1950's epic just cut the Grodian Knot and ride out of the store on old Bucephalus!Oh yes, I hope the up coming new release of Alexander, anticipated and welcomed, surpasses this version as there is nothing much better than a good movie, but this 1956 Richard Burton, Fredric March film may be above the mark in the end, as so many remakes or rehashed films can never come close the their predecessors, even with all of the CGI of today.

Bernabo,"[19, 23]","With films about Alexander the Great directed by Oliver Stone and Baz Luhrmann supposedly being released in 2004 and 2005 respectively, the 1956 film ""Alexander the Great"" from director Robert Rossen with Richard Burton in the title role is probably going to see renewed interest.  However, despite providing a realistic portrayal of a historical legend and being one of the most historically faithful films about the ancient world ever to be made, there is something missing from this would be epic.""Alexander the Great"" was written, produced and directed by Rossen, who had won the Academy Award for ""All the King's Men"" (1949) and would be nominated gain for ""The Hustler"" (1961).  All three films have in common the realistic portrait of a complex psychological figure.  Burton plays Alexander as being both energetic and a visionary, with quicksilver changes in mood.  Alexander is both idealistic and practical, intelligent but hot-tempered, courageous but shrewd.  Although he conquers the Persian Empire while still basically a boy, this is a conqueror who suffers defeats and almost falls prey to becoming an Oriental potentate just like Darius (Harry Andrews), the Persian king he just conquered.  This is a man who can kill a friend in a moment of anger while drunk and weep over the body.The more you know about the historical Alexander the more impressed you are by the film's fidelity to what appears in Plutarch.  Here is the Alexander who worshiped Achilles and loved Homer's ""Iliad,"" who was taught by Aristotle, cut the Gordian knot, destroyed Persepolis, and died a young man at Babylon.  The battles sequences, such as the battle at the river Granicus, run rather short, but are not all that bad.  The problem is that for all the complexity of Alexander's character and the intensity of Burton's performance, there is no real sense of mission or accomplishment to his conquering the known world.  We see what happened, but are curiously unaffected by the film's implicitly explanation for why he did it.The rationale suggested by the film is found in Alexander's father, King Philip of Macedonia.  Played by Fredric March, Philip has a memorable scene after the battle of Chaeronea against the united city-states of Greece when he gets drunk and mocks the Athenian orator Demosthenes for having called him a barbarian.  When Philip is assassinated Alexander chases after the assassin and kills him, and even the most basic understanding of Freudian psychology tells us that the son will spend the rest of his life trying to impress his dead father.In the end the explanation for conquering the world becomes the same as Sir Edmund Hillary's famous quote for why he climbed Mt. Everest.  To wit, ""Because it was there.""  When you are on top of the world, there is a certain logic to such a quip.  But when the subject is conquering the known world starting with a relatively small kingdom north of Greece, the same idea seems rather hollow.  Hopefully Stone and/or Luhrmann can come up with not only better explanations, but much better films.",3,A less than stellar 1956 epic film about Alexander the Great,1053129600,"05 17, 2003",2003,3062,"['films', 'Alexander', 'Great', 'directed', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'Baz', 'Luhrmann', 'supposedly', 'being', 'released', '2004', '2005', 'respectively', '1956', 'film', 'Alexander', 'Great', 'director', 'Robert', 'Rossen', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'title', 'role', 'probably', 'going', 'see', 'renewed', 'interest', 'However', 'providing', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'historical', 'legend', 'being', 'one', 'most', 'historically', 'faithful', 'films', 'ancient', 'world', 'ever', 'be', 'made', 'something', 'missing', 'would', 'be', 'epic', 'Great', 'was', 'written', 'produced', 'directed', 'Rossen', 'who', 'had', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'King', 'Men', '1949', 'would', 'be', 'nominated', 'gain', 'Hustler', '1961', 'three', 'films', 'have', 'common', 'realistic', 'portrait', 'complex', 'psychological', 'figure', 'Burton', 'Alexander', 'being', 'energetic', 'visionary', 'quicksilver', 'changes', 'mood', 'Alexander', 'idealistic', 'practical', 'intelligent', 'hot-tempered', 'courageous', 'shrewd', 'Persian', 'Empire', 'still', 'basically', 'boy', 'conqueror', 'who', 'defeats', 'almost', 'falls', 'prey', 'becoming', 'Oriental', 'potentate', 'just', 'Darius', 'Harry', 'Andrews', 'Persian', 'king', 'just', 'conquered', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'kill', 'friend', 'moment', 'anger', 'drunk', 'weep', 'body.The', 'more', 'know', 'historical', 'Alexander', 'more', 'impressed', 'are', 'film', 'fidelity', 'what', 'Plutarch', 'Here', 'Alexander', 'who', 'worshiped', 'Achilles', 'loved', 'Homer', 'Iliad', 'who', 'was', 'taught', 'Aristotle', 'cut', 'Gordian', 'knot', 'destroyed', 'Persepolis', 'died', 'young', 'man', 'Babylon', 'battles', 'sequences', 'such', 'battle', 'river', 'Granicus', 'run', 'rather', 'short', 'are', 'not', 'bad', 'problem', 'complexity', 'Alexander', 'character', 'intensity', 'Burton', 'performance', 'real', 'sense', 'mission', 'accomplishment', 'conquering', 'known', 'world', 'see', 'what', 'happened', 'are', 'curiously', 'unaffected', 'film', 'implicitly', 'explanation', 'why', 'did', 'it.The', 'rationale', 'suggested', 'film', 'found', 'Alexander', 'father', 'King', 'Philip', 'Macedonia', 'Played', 'Fredric', 'March', 'Philip', 'memorable', 'scene', 'battle', 'Chaeronea', 'united', 'city-states', 'Greece', 'when', 'drunk', 'Athenian', 'orator', 'Demosthenes', 'having', 'called', 'barbarian', 'When', 'Philip', 'assassinated', 'Alexander', 'chases', 'assassin', 'even', 'most', 'basic', 'understanding', 'Freudian', 'psychology', 'tells', 'son', 'will', 'spend', 'rest', 'life', 'trying', 'impress', 'dead', 'father.In', 'end', 'explanation', 'conquering', 'world', 'same', 'Sir', 'Edmund', 'Hillary', 'famous', 'quote', 'why', 'climbed', 'Mt', 'Everest', 'wit', 'was', 'there', 'When', 'are', 'top', 'world', 'certain', 'logic', 'quip', 'when', 'subject', 'conquering', 'known', 'world', 'starting', 'relatively', 'small', 'kingdom', 'north', 'Greece', 'same', 'idea', 'rather', 'hollow', 'Hopefully', 'Stone', 'Luhrmann', 'can', 'come', 'up', 'not', 'only', 'better', 'explanations', 'much', 'better', 'films']",Alexander the Great VHS
275903,A22MG5N2AY9HB8,6301964306,Louise,"[2, 2]","The 1956 Alexander the Great is a historically accurate film about the life of the Macedonian King Alexander the Great. The first plus about the film is the cast. Richard Burton plays a blonde haired Alexander son of Phillip and Olympias. Olympias is played by the French actress Danielle Darrieux. Fredric March plays Phillip II of Macedonia. There were at least thirty characters in the film. Charlton Heston was sought for the role of Alexander but turned it down. He quoted ""Alexander is the easiest kind of picture to make badly"". Burton was 29 when he played the part but obviously looked to old to play the Macedonian King. The film originally was to be three hours long but was cut to 2 hours 16 minutes.The 1956 movie unlike the Oliver Stone film starts with Phillip (Fredric March) on his campaigns. Alexander hasn't even been born yet. Phillip wants to take over the Greek city states. He leads a campaign to take over Olynthus when he is told that Olympias has borne him a son.  Phillip returns to Macedonia to see Alexander. He is told by the Egyptian soothsayer that Alexander is a god born of the god Zeus. At this time the General Parmenion  campaigned with Phillip. Parmenion is played by Niall Mac Ginnis. The movie really engages the viewer into a father son relationship. Alexander learns from his tutor Aristotle played by Barry Jones. Alexander goes with his father on campaigns and fights at his side. The battle scenes were superb. The first battle is at Athens with the Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BCE.As the movie progresses we find that there are some family problems. Phillip divorces Olympias to marry Eurydice and make her his Queen. (Historically this was true but the woman's name was Cleopatra Eurydice not just Eurydice.) There are no undertones of Alexander's homosexuality like in the Colin Farrell production. In truth I could have done without all of the homosexual undertones of the Oliver Stone film. Richard Burton is much better suited to the role of an intellectual  Alexander who was hungry for power and glory and slowly goes mad.(After all Richard Burton can pull off any part and make it come alive)The film continues to follow history as the evil Olympias puts her plot into motion to have Phillip killed. Phillip and Eurydice have a boy who is full blooded Macedonian which would cut Alexander out of the succession. Olympias was from Epirus. Alexander was not full blooded Macedonian. The marriage of Phillip to Attalus' niece severs the father son relationship and Olympias uses this as an opportunity to turn  Alexander away from his drunken father. Pausanias, a loyal friend of Alexander and part of Phillip's Army murders the Macedonian King. In turn Alexander murders Pausanias. Now Alexander is King of Macedonia. His first aim is to follow in his father's footsteps and conquer Asia, something his father wanted but never achieved. Alexander wants the Macedonians to swear an oath of loyalty to him. Memnon (Peter Cushing) is exiled for not swearing loyalty to Alexander.The film switches to the land of Persia with Darius III as the King of Kings. The costuming for the Persians was superb as well as the crowns and headdresses. Harry Andrews plays Darius. Memnon is in Darius' court. Memnon is played by Peter Cushing who later starred in various horror flicks with Vincent Price and Christopher Lee. Historically Memnon of Rhodes was the commander of the Greek mercenaries in the service of the Persian King Darius III. Memnon advocated a scorched earth policy against Alexander. Alexander attacks Darius at the River Granicus. Alexander goes to Phrygia and cuts the Gordius knot. This movie follows history as it would play out in a documentary. It doesn't flip back and forth like the Oliver Stone production. At the battle in Babylon Darius flees and is killed by his own commanders. When Alexander finds this out he executes the two commanders then he reads a letter that Darius wrote telling him to take Roxana his daughter as a wife. (This is where history is a little shady). Stateira was Darius' daughter. Alexander does marry Stateira but leaves to go to Bactria where he marries Princess Roxana. She also goes with him on his campaigns. According to the history Alexander truly loved Roxana. There is a plot to kill Alexander.  Philotas fails to warn Alexander of the plot and is put to death. Parmenion, the father of Philotas is also killed. They are killed by Alexander's Generals. In Babylon a woman named Barsine sets fire to the temples in Babylon to avenge Greece. This happened in the history. Then Alexander goes into India. He kills his friend Cleitus  in a drunken rage. Alexander marries Roxana in Susa and dies in Babylon. (Alexander was poisoned by Cassander and his father Antipater.  It has was thought that the water was mixed with the wine and the water had a bacteria that caused a fever. Later Cassander has Roxana and her thirteen year old son killed and has Olympias killed. Cassander was not in this film but was in the Oliver Stone version.)So if you love Greek History and old films you will like and appreciate this film. Some might find this film boring but when you know your facts and if your a lover of ancient history you will enjoy this film. It was much better than the Oliver Stone's version of Alexander the Great. I recommend this film to lovers of history and old film lovers.",5,A Sword And Sandal Epic!,1372032000,"06 24, 2013",2013,5382,"['1956', 'Alexander', 'Great', 'historically', 'accurate', 'film',

275904,AAW58LG72PG7I,6301964306,"Martin Asiner ""Adjunct College Instructor""","[1, 1]","For a film that has as many classic actors as it does, ALEXANDER THE GREAT still manages to misfire enough to cause the viewer to lose interest by midpoint.  Whenever a film goes off course like that, the fault is usually the director's.  In this case, Robert Rossen took a very big budget film and used it appallingly.  Rossem filmed ALEXANDER THE GREAT as if it were two unrelated movies.  The first half has Alexander (Richard Burton) in constant Oedipal conflict with his father Phillip (Frederick March).  March plays Phillip as a ruler more interested in protecting his realm from a son whom he considers to be only quasi-legitimate since his wife (Danielle Darrieux) was forced on him as part of a political alliance.  Phillip raises Alexander as one who is fit to command an army but not a nation.  For that, he dreams of choosing a wife with whom he may bear a son to rule after him.  Burton plays Alexander as one who owes fealty to his father but only at the cost of fealty to his destiny.  From the very moment of Alexander's birth, omens presage his latent divinity, all the while reinforcing in Phillip's mind that his son is a mixed blessing.  Alexander grows knowing that his future in irrevocably mixed with the Gods of Olympus.  By the time that Phillip is assassinated, Alexander is convinced that his destiny and Greece's destiny are the same thing.The second half is a working out of Alexander's vision of world conquest.  The Gods of Olympus choose their entrants most carefully and Alexander deduces that it is only by humbling the Persian king Darius that he may assume the mantle of divinity.  The problem of the second half is a continuation of that of the first half.  For a film that chronicles the exploits of a world conquerer, ALEXANDER THE GREAT does not deliver the military dramatic goods. Whenever Alexander's forces face a foe, the entire filmed battle is more of a vignette than lively interpretation of blood and gore.  Historically, Alexander overcame fearsome odds at nearly every battle by means of tactical genius.  Here, he simply lines up his men and shouts at them ""Charge!""  The frequent discourses between March and Burton hold the first half more or less together, but there is nothing like that to do likewise in the second.  Alexander runs from one battle to another whose fiercest opposition comes not from any Persian but from malcontents in his own army who see him as a false god unwilling to take them back to Greece after a ten year hiatus in Asia conquering the known world.  Burton, as usual, holds up his end with his richly resonant voice though his physique seems a little too pretty-boy like for the role.  There is not a whiff of any homesexual subtext that is usually associated with any filmed version of Alexander's life.  ALEXANDER THE GREAT concludes as a film that is a sad misuse of what should have been a soul stirring spectacle of one who sought to rule a world when he could not first rule himself.",3,Long on Spectacle Short on Drama,1251676800,"08 31, 2009",2009,2972,"['film', 'as', 'many', 'classic', 'actors', 'ALEXANDER', 'THE', 'GREAT', 'still', 'misfire', 'enough', 'cause', 'viewer', 'lose', 'interest', 'midpoint', 'Whenever', 'film', 'course', 'fault', 'usually', 'director', 'case', 'Robert', 'Rossen', 'took', 'very', 'big', 'budget', 'film', 'used', 'appallingly', 'Rossem', 'filmed', 'ALEXANDER', 'THE', 'GREAT', 'were', 'two', 'unrelated', 'movies', 'first', 'half', 'Alexander', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'constant', 'Oedipal', 'conflict', 'father', 'Phillip', 'Frederick', 'March', 'March', 'Phillip', 'ruler', 'more', 'interested', 'protecting', 'realm', 'son', 'whom', 'be', 'only', 'quasi-legitimate', 'wife', 'Danielle', 'Darrieux', 'was', 'forced', 'part', 'political', 'alliance', 'Phillip', 'Alexander', 'one', 'who', 'fit', 'command', 'army', 'not', 'nation', 'choosing', 'wife', 'whom', 'may', 'bear', 'son', 'rule', 'Burton', 'Alexander', 'one', 'who', 'fealty', 'father', 'only', 'cost', 'fealty', 'destiny', 'very', 'moment', 'Alexander', 'birth', 'presage', 'latent', 'divinity', 'while', 'reinforcing', 'Phillip', 'mind', 'son', 'mixed', 'blessing', 'Alexander', 'knowing', 'future', 'irrevocably', 'mixed', 'Gods', 'Olympus', 'time', 'Phillip', 'assassinated', 'Alexander', 'convinced', 'destiny', 'Greece', 'destiny', 'are', 'same', 'thing.The', 'second', 'half', 'working', 'Alexander', 'vision', 'world', 'conquest', 'Gods', 'Olympus', 'choose', 'entrants', 'most', 'carefully', 'Alexander', 'deduces', 'only', 'humbling', 'Persian', 'king', 'Darius', 'may', 'assume', 'mantle', 'divinity', 'problem', 'second', 'half', 'continuation', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'exploits', 'world', 'conquerer', 'ALEXANDER', 'THE', 'GREAT', 'not', 'deliver', 'military', 'dramatic', 'goods', 'Whenever', 'Alexander', 'forces', 'face', 'foe', 'entire', 'filmed', 'battle', 'more', 'vignette', 'lively', 'interpretation', 'blood', 'gore', 'Historically', 'Alexander', 'fearsome', 'odds', 'nearly', 'battle', 'means', 'tactical', 'genius', 'Here', 'simply', 'lines', 'men', 'shouts', 'Charge', 'frequent', 'discourses', 'March', 'Burton', 'hold', 'first', 'half', 'more', 'less', 'together', 'nothing', 'do', 'likewise', 'second', 'Alexander', 'one', 'battle', 'fiercest', 'opposition', 'not', 'Persian', 'malcontents', 'own', 'army', 'who', 'see', 'false', 'god', 'unwilling', 'take', 'back', 'Greece', 'ten', 'year', 'hiatus', 'Asia', 'conquering', 'known', 'world', 'Burton', 'usual', 'end', 'richly', 'resonant', 'voice', 'physique', 'little', 'too', 'pretty-boy', 'role', 'not', 'whiff', 'homesexual', 'subtext', 'usually', 'associated', 'filmed', 'version', 'Alexander', 'life', 'THE', 'GREAT', 'film', 'sad', 'misuse', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'soul', 'stirring', 'spectacle', 'one', 'who', 'sought', 'rule', 'world', 'when', 'could', 'not', 'first', 'rule']",Alexander the Great VHS
275905,A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z,6301964306,Octavius,"[7, 12]","Robert Rossen 1950's attempt at writing and directing a film on a character as intriguing and dynamic as Alexander The Great falls flat. The subject itself calls for only the most devoted and skilled masters of film which Rossen was not for purposes of this genre.Because Alexander The Great accomplished so much within only 13 of his 33 years of life, it is virtually impossible to make a good movie on that part alone in less than 3 hours. Richard Burton delivers a strong performance as Alexander but also seems too constrained; Butrton fails to deliver the youthful vigor of which Alexander had so much of. Not only was Alexander a king and conqueror, he was a military genius; a philosopher; a bold explorer; and, in his own mind anyway, a god amongst mortal men. Burton's performance often seems too grave and reserved and fails to reflect Alexander's dynamic personality.I did like the movie for its focus on Alexander's childhood but that also came short. Alexander's family in this film almost seems to be an excerpt from 'Leave It To Beaver' than the depiction of a pagan royal family that lived 2000 years ago. Although a military genius in his own right, Phillip was a debauche and drunkard whose bizzare sexual preferences shocked even his Greek neighbors. For example, after the battle of Charonea, Phillip II swaggered drunk around the corpses of the enemy and, lifting their heads as if seeking an audience, would yell for Demonsthenes (Athenian orator and staunch enemy of Phillip.) Olympias was a conspiring queen and pagan priestess whose incessant scheming were directed at both Alexander and/or Phillip at one point or another. The characters were poorly presented in this film.The movie doesn't really cover the campaign or its battles very well either. Looking at the movie, one barely gets any view as to how Alexander refined his father's tactics of the Macedonian phalanx to its peak; a military tactic unmatched until it came against the more fluid ones of the Roman legions almost 200 years later. The same is true as to Alexander's great siege of Tyre in which he built a mile-long jetti into the sea to connect with the City's gates; his hard fought geurilla campaign against Darius' renegade satraps; or his victories against Porus' elephants in India. There are also gross inaccuracies in the film in that Roxanne wasn't Darius III's daughter.Regardless of its flaws, this film is one hundred times better than Oliver Stone's new film on Alexander The Great: take my word for it. In the spirit of Phillip's last words of wisdom to his son, ""Viewers, ask for thyselves a greater movie, for that which Rossen and Stone leave you is too small for thee.""",2,Nothing Great About This Alexander,1091145600,"07 30, 2004",2004,2682,"['Robert', 'Rossen', '1950', 'attempt', 'writing', 'directing', 'film', 'character', 'intriguing', 'dynamic', 'Alexander', 'Great', 'flat', 'subject', 'only', 'most', 'devoted', 'skilled', 'masters', 'film', 'Rossen', 'was', 'not', 'purposes', 'genre.Because', 'Great', 'accomplished', 'so', 'much', 'only', '13', '33', 'years', 'life', 'virtually', 'impossible', 'make', 'good', 'movie', 'part', 'alone', 'less', '3', 'hours', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'strong', 'performance', 'Alexander', 'also', 'too', 'constrained', 'Butrton', 'deliver', 'youthful', 'vigor', 'Alexander', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'Alexander', 'king', 'conqueror', 'was', 'military', 'genius', 'philosopher', 'bold', 'explorer', 'own', 'mind', 'anyway', 'god', 'mortal', 'men', 'Burton', 'performance', 'often', 'too', 'grave', 'reserved', 'reflect', 'Alexander', 'dynamic', 'personality.I', 'did', 'movie', 'focus', 'Alexander', 'childhood', 'also', 'came', 'short', 'Alexander', 'family', 'film', 'almost', 'be', 'excerpt', ""'Leave"", 'Beaver', 'depiction', 'pagan', 'royal', 'family', 'lived', '2000', 'years', 'ago', 'military', 'genius', 'own', 'right', 'Phillip', 'was', 'debauche', 'drunkard', 'bizzare', 'sexual', 'preferences', 'shocked', 'even', 'Greek', 'neighbors', 'example', 'battle', 'Charonea', 'Phillip', 'II', 'swaggered', 'drunk', 'corpses', 'enemy', 'lifting', 'heads', 'seeking', 'audience', 'would', 'yell', 'Demonsthenes', 'Athenian', 'orator', 'staunch', 'enemy', 'Phillip', 'Olympias', 'was', 'conspiring', 'queen', 'pagan', 'priestess', 'incessant', 'scheming', 'were', 'directed', 'Alexander', 'and/or', 'Phillip', 'one', 'point', 'characters', 'were', 'poorly', 'presented', 'film.The', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'cover', 'campaign', 'battles', 'very', 'well', 'either', 'Looking', 'movie', 'one', 'barely', 'view', 'how', 'Alexander', 'refined', 'father', 'tactics', 'Macedonian', 'phalanx', 'peak', 'military', 'tactic', 'unmatched', 'came', 'more', 'fluid', 'ones', 'Roman', 'almost', '200', 'years', 'later', 'same', 'true', 'Alexander', 'great', 'siege', 'Tyre', 'built', 'mile-long', 'jetti', 'sea', 'connect', 'City', 'gates', 'hard', 'fought', 'geurilla', 'campaign', 'Darius', 'renegade', 'satraps', 'victories', 'Porus', 'elephants', 'India', 'are', 'also', 'gross', 'inaccuracies', 'film', 'Roxanne', 'was', ""n't"", 'Darius', 'III', 'daughter.Regardless', 'flaws', 'film', 'one', 'hundred', 'times', 'better', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'new', 'film', 'Alexander', 'Great', 'take', 'word', 'spirit', 'Phillip', 'last', 'words', 'wisdom', 'son', 'Viewers', 'ask', 'greater', 'movie', 'Rossen', 'Stone', 'leave', 'too', 'small', 'thee']",Alexander the Great VHS

As the movie unfolded, I had a hard time believing that he would participate in this film of near-epic length.  He plays the role of Phillip, the father of Alexander and manages to appear through nearly half of the movie.  We get a sort of Oedipal understanding of Alexander and his parents which adds nothing to the movie.  The role of Phillip requires that March convey a robust masculine appearance which, at this stage of his life, required as much make-up as acting ability.  On the other hand, once we get a look at Richard Burton as the adult Alexander, we can't see anything but his curly blond hair.  I mention these things because this lengthly movie tends to underscore the importance of costume, makeup, coiffering, sets, special effects, etc. by doing such a sloppy job with each.  The story is disjointed and might have survived impressing the pre-teen male audience if it at least had some powerful battle scenes.  However, each battle shows us a mass of soldiers on horse and afoot who hold their swords in the air and occassionally swing them about weakly.  Nobody seems to be agressive (or even assertive) in these encounters.  They seem more like commuters trying to get through Grand Central Station at rush hour; they don't mean to hurt anyone but they're too busy trying to get through the crowd to care if they do.  I have to admit that I am confessing my own personal short-comings by acknowledging that I watched the entired 135 minutes of this farce.

275911,A2BIAR1V0PWO27,6301964306,"Roger Kennedy ""International Military Music S...","[20, 26]","With the recent Oliver Stone movie on Alexander just out, its always interesting to dive back and look at earlier versions of this subject.  One thing for sure, Colin Farrell cannot compare to Richard Burton!  Burton looks and acts the part, and is not all dolled up with dyed hair!  He has a commanding presence about him.  This film has a docu-drama quality to it, which may bore the average movie-goer, but at least there is a good effort to re-create the history of the time.Here we get a stronger portrait of the tortured relationship between Alexander and his father, Philip II.  Frederic March is terrific in the role, and again, Val Kilmer loses out badly!  The qaulity of acting in this earlier movie far surpases the current epic on many levels.  Some may find this film a bit stiff, but at least it keeps close to its subject matter and never loses sight of it.  The same cannot be said of the recent Oliver Stone epic.The production value for 1960 is pretty good, although perhaps not as impressive as the current version.  The battle scenes are brief, and not large scale.  Both movies fail to show the true origin of the Macedonian Phalanx system and how it would defeat the Persians. Here we see a brief version of the Battle of Cheronea in 336 BC which saw Philip and Alex defeat the last Greek resistence of Macedonia in the form of Athens and Thebes.  We get a small Granicus here, and no Issus.  Both Movies show Gaugamala (Arbela)and I would have to give the Oliver Stone movie more credit for showing this epic battle more impressively.This older movie presents a striaght-forward portrait of Alexander.  There are no homo-erotic overtones which are popular today, and little deviation from the image we know of him.  The style of production is more standard and traditional.  Perhaps a little statuesque, some may find this film too stiff and boring, but it is a worthy companion to the current epic which seeks to wow its audience with special effects and visually imagery.  None of that here!  Burton gives a moody and convinving look at the great Macedonian, without having to show a lurid image.  Of course there are many views of Alexander to chose from, and one must decide which one suits their interests best.  If the more traditional view is sought then this movie should fit the bill nicely.",4,Ponderous Classic,1101859200,"12 1, 2004",2004,2323,"['recent', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'movie', 'Alexander', 'just', 'out', 'always', 'interesting', 'dive', 'back', 'look', 'earlier', 'versions', 'subject', 'One', 'thing', 'sure', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'can', 'not', 'compare', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'Burton', 'part', 'not', 'dolled', 'up', 'dyed', 'hair', 'commanding', 'presence', 'film', 'docu-drama', 'quality', 'may', 'bore', 'average', 'movie-goer', 'least', 'good', 'effort', 're-create', 'history', 'time.Here', 'get', 'stronger', 'portrait', 'tortured', 'relationship', 'Alexander', 'father', 'Philip', 'II', 'Frederic', 'March', 'terrific', 'role', 'again', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'out', 'badly', 'qaulity', 'acting', 'earlier', 'movie', 'far', 'current', 'epic', 'many', 'levels', 'may', 'find', 'film', 'bit', 'stiff', 'least', 'close', 'subject', 'matter', 'never', 'sight', 'same', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'said', 'recent', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'production', 'value', '1960', 'pretty', 'good', 'perhaps', 'not', 'as', 'impressive', 'current', 'version', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'brief', 'not', 'large', 'scale', 'movies', 'fail', 'show', 'true', 'origin', 'Macedonian', 'Phalanx', 'system', 'how', 'would', 'defeat', 'Persians', 'Here', 'see', 'brief', 'version', 'Battle', 'Cheronea', '336', 'BC', 'saw', 'Philip', 'Alex', 'defeat', 'last', 'Greek', 'resistence', 'Macedonia', 'form', 'Athens', 'Thebes', 'get', 'small', 'Granicus', 'here', 'Issus', 'Movies', 'show', 'Gaugamala', 'Arbela', 'would', 'have', 'give', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'movie', 'more', 'credit', 'showing', 'epic', 'battle', 'more', 'impressively.This', 'older', 'movie', 'striaght-forward', 'portrait', 'Alexander', 'are', 'homo-erotic', 'overtones', 'are', 'popular', 'today', 'little', 'deviation', 'image', 'know', 'style', 'production', 'more', 'standard', 'traditional', 'Perhaps', 'little', 'statuesque', 'may', 'find', 'film', 'too', 'stiff', 'boring', 'worthy', 'companion', 'current', 'epic', 'wow', 'audience', 'special', 'effects', 'visually', 'imagery', 'None', 'here', 'Burton', 'moody', 'convinving', 'look', 'great', 'Macedonian', 'having', 'show', 'lurid', 'image', 'course', 'are', 'many', 'views', 'Alexander', 'chose', 'one', 'must', 'decide', 'one', 'suits', 'interests', 'best', 'more', 'traditional', 'view', 'sought', 'then', 'movie', 'should', 'fit', 'bill', 'nicely']",Alexander the Great VHS

De Mille's enjoyable excesses or undemanding star vehicles for the likes of Tony Curtis and Cornel Wilde. He certainly chose a big subject - the most successful conqueror of the classical era - so it's perhaps not too surprising that with only 136 minutes at his disposal to do the Macedonian leader's short but eventful life justice he fell short.Focusing on Alexander's conflicts with his brash and vulgar father and his mother's plotting as he sets out to live a life worthy of a god, it's not nearly as talky as its reputation, although unfortunately some of the talk does bring out the ham in Richard Burton and Frederic March in particular. Yet it's a more focused and accessible telling of a man who determinedly set out to become a legend than Oliver Stone's flawed but ambitious fractured narrative half a century later, and many of the scenes are surprisingly memorable. It's never entirely successful, but it works well enough to keep your interest, and if history doesn't always get its due onscreen at least for once it's not because the director is aiming for the lowest common denominator but overreaching himself with a subject that's too big for just one film.MGM/UA's DVD has a decent widescreen transfer with the original theatrical trailer the only extra.",4,An ambitious but not always successful attempt at a thinking man's epic,1301270400,"03 28, 2011",2011,1498,"['was', 'bold', 'Robert', 'Rossen', 'attempt', 'make', ""'thinking"", 'man', 'epic', 'four', 'years', 'term', 'would', 'creep', 'common', 'usage', 'Spartacus', 'time', 'when', 'popular', 'image', 'screen', 'epic', 'was', 'Cecil', 'B', 'De', 'Mille', 'enjoyable', 'excesses', 'undemanding', 'star', 'vehicles', 'likes', 'Tony', 'Curtis', 'Cornel', 'Wilde', 'certainly', 'chose', 'big', 'subject', 'most', 'successful', 'conqueror', 'classical', 'era', 'perhaps', 'not', 'too', 'surprising', 'only', '136', 'minutes', 'disposal', 'do', 'Macedonian', 'leader', 'short', 'eventful', 'life', 'justice', 'fell', 'short.Focusing', 'Alexander', 'conflicts', 'brash', 'vulgar', 'father', 'mother', 'plotting', 'out', 'live', 'life', 'worthy', 'god', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'talky', 'reputation', 'unfortunately', 'talk', 'bring', 'out', 'ham', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'Frederic', 'March', 'particular', 'more', 'focused', 'accessible', 'telling', 'man', 'who', 'determinedly', 'set', 'out', 'become', 'legend', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'flawed', 'ambitious', 'fractured', 'narrative', 'half', 'century', 'later', 'many', 'scenes', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'memorable', 'never', 'entirely', 'successful', 'well', 'enough', 'keep', 'interest', 'history', ""n't"", 'always', 'get', 'due', 'onscreen', 'least', 'not', 'director', 'aiming', 'lowest', 'common', 'denominator', 'overreaching', 'subject', 'too', 'big', 'just', 'one', 'film.MGM/UA', 'DVD', 'decent', 'widescreen', 'transfer', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'only', 'extra']",Alexander the Great VHS
