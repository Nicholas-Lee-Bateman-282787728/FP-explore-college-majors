1378294,A1DURK17MGKBEB,B003ZTNT38,Ben Wasden,"[0, 0]","Unsolved Suburbia is a gay noir drama. The cast is comprised of mostly teen characters. And boy, is it a mess! There is some humor (but not enough), and some good nudity (but again not enough). However, that's where the positives stop. Everything else, from the acting, to the pacing, to the direction is pretty bad. And the plot goes back and forth, and it makes things really confusing. How Unsolved Suburbia got released is a mystery that is and will always be ""Unsolved"". 2 stars out of 5 for the nudity and cute guys.",2,Almost As Bad As People Say It Is,1316563200,"09 21, 2011",2011,522,"['Unsolved', 'Suburbia', 'gay', 'noir', 'drama', 'cast', 'comprised', 'mostly', 'teen', 'characters', 'boy', 'mess', 'humor', 'not', 'enough', 'good', 'nudity', 'again', 'not', 'enough', 'However', 'where', 'positives', 'stop', 'Everything', 'else', 'acting', 'pacing', 'direction', 'pretty', 'bad', 'plot', 'back', 'forth', 'things', 'really', 'confusing', 'How', 'Unsolved', 'Suburbia', 'got', 'released', 'mystery', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'Unsolved', '2', 'stars', '5', 'nudity', 'cute', 'guys']",Unsolved Suburbia
1378295,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B003ZTNT38,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[7, 7]","Marty is a high school senior who is gay ... on weekdays.  Weekends, he has a girlfriend.  Life gets complicated when the girlfriend meets the boyfriend, then implausible when they decide to become one combined, happy ""triple.""But Marty is also concerned about his friend Jake, whose claim to fame seems to be as a peeping Tom, a skill which reportedly he has used to influence friends and make some spare cash.  Then there's Thomas, whom Marty helps to hide after Thomas' boyfriend Eddie is shot, possibly by Thomas' homophobic brother, a theory with which Marty disagrees.This is essentially a parody of an old film noir mystery - complete with ""red herring"" tangents - crossed with a ""gay boys go wild"" sex comedy. The screenwriter seamlessly uses black and white as well as color photography, dramatic music, and multiple showings of scenes from different perspectives.  It gets rather confusing, though the inexperienced actors make a shaky script and meandering dialogue seem better with their efforts, for the most part. Coming in at just 66 minutes, counting the numerous repeats of scenes, there simply isn't much here, if you look at the film as a whole. DVD has only chapter stops; not rated, but would be an R for lots of male and female nudity.  I'll give it just three stars out of five.",3,Amusing but lightweight/meandering gay film noir mystery,1287446400,"10 19, 2010",2010,1301,"['Marty', 'high', 'school', 'senior', 'who', 'gay', 'weekdays', 'Weekends', 'girlfriend', 'Life', 'complicated', 'when', 'girlfriend', 'boyfriend', 'then', 'implausible', 'when', 'decide', 'become', 'one', 'combined', 'happy', 'triple', 'Marty', 'also', 'concerned', 'friend', 'Jake', 'claim', 'fame', 'be', 'peeping', 'Tom', 'skill', 'reportedly', 'used', 'influence', 'friends', 'make', 'spare', 'cash', 'Then', 'Thomas', 'whom', 'Marty', 'hide', 'Thomas', 'boyfriend', 'Eddie', 'shot', 'possibly', 'Thomas', 'homophobic', 'brother', 'theory', 'Marty', 'disagrees.This', 'essentially', 'parody', 'old', 'film', 'noir', 'mystery', 'complete', 'red', 'herring', 'tangents', 'crossed', 'gay', 'boys', 'go', 'wild', 'sex', 'comedy', 'screenwriter', 'seamlessly', 'black', 'white', 'as', 'well', 'color', 'photography', 'dramatic', 'music', 'multiple', 'showings', 'scenes', 'different', 'perspectives', 'rather', 'confusing', 'inexperienced', 'actors', 'make', 'shaky', 'script', 'meandering', 'dialogue', 'seem', 'better', 'efforts', 'most', 'part', 'Coming', 'just', '66', 'minutes', 'counting', 'numerous', 'repeats', 'scenes', 'simply', ""n't"", 'much', 'here', 'look', 'film', 'whole', 'DVD', 'only', 'chapter', 'stops', 'not', 'rated', 'would', 'be', 'R', 'lots', 'male', 'female', 'nudity', ""'ll"", 'give', 'just', 'three', 'stars', 'five']",Unsolved Suburbia
