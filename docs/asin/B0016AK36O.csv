1153095,AVGEP46YTOH9Q,B0016AK36O,"Happosai ""Happy""","[0, 2]","The final season doesn't contain the ""true"" ending as shown in the final manga volume. In that volume, Ranma's mother accepts her son's and husband's curse. It would've been nice if the writers included this ending. I've read every manga volume, watched every episode as well as the two movies and the OAV series. So many stories in the manga have been left out of the anime. One story in particular is about Ryoga's new girlfriend near the end of the manga. She knows his secret and still loves him. I wished that the entire manga series was written into the anime (look at Dragonball/DBZ for example).I only wonder what Rumiko Takahashi has to say about all of this.",3,disapointed,1218153600,"08 8, 2008",2008,668,"['final', 'season', ""n't"", 'contain', 'true', 'ending', 'shown', 'final', 'manga', 'volume', 'volume', 'Ranma', 'mother', 'son', 'husband', 'curse', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'nice', 'writers', 'included', 'ending', ""'ve"", 'read', 'manga', 'volume', 'watched', 'episode', 'as', 'well', 'two', 'movies', 'OAV', 'series', 'So', 'many', 'stories', 'manga', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'anime', 'One', 'story', 'particular', 'Ryoga', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'end', 'manga', 'secret', 'still', 'wished', 'entire', 'manga', 'series', 'was', 'written', 'anime', 'look', 'Dragonball/DBZ', 'example', 'only', 'wonder', 'what', 'Rumiko', 'Takahashi', 'say']",Ranma 1/2: Ranma Forever - Season 7
1153096,A1EEG7YJIYN60B,B0016AK36O,Lesley Aeschliman,"[1, 1]","Ranma 1/2 Ranma Forever is a DVD box set of the seventh season of Ranma 1/2.  This set contains a total of twenty-five episodes.  The first four discs contain five episodes, while the fifth disc contains five episodes and the special features.The special features menu contains seven options: ""Line Art Gallery,"" ""Textless Opening,"" ""Textless Ending,"" ""Cast List,"" ""Actor Profiles,"" ""Ranma 1/2 `Cast Wrap Party',"" and ""Ranma 1/2 `End of Ranma 1/2 Party'.""  As expected, the textless opening and ending are just the opening and ending credits without the text.  The line art gallery contains twenty-five pages of model sketches of the characters and some of the locations that appear in this DVD box set.  The cast list is a list of the English and Japanese voice actors for each character.  The actor profiles are selected filmographies for the English voice actors.The Ranma 1/2 ""Cast Wrap Party"" is a roughly six minute feature that includes interviews with some of the English cast, intercut with footage from the English dub version of Ranma 1/2.  However, the audio quality on this features isn't very good; in fact, there's one voice actor interviewed in this piece that you really can't hear well enough to understand what she is saying.  The Ranma 1/2 ""End of Ranma 1/2 Party"" is another six minute feature from a fan party celebrating the end of the series.  This feature includes interviews with some of the cast, as well as some fans; this is also intercut with footage from the English dub version of Ranma 1/2.  On the one hand, I applaud Viz Media for going to the effort to include these final two special features on the set.  However, I'm disappointed by the quality of these two features, especially the audio quality for the ""Cast Wrap Party.""Even with this set's flaws, it really should be in an anime fan's DVD collection.",3,The final season box set for Ranma 1/2,1249344000,"08 4, 2009",2009,1843,"['Ranma', '1/2', 'Ranma', 'Forever', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', 'seventh', 'season', 'Ranma', '1/2', 'set', 'total', 'twenty-five', 'episodes', 'first', 'four', 'discs', 'contain', 'five', 'episodes', 'fifth', 'disc', 'five', 'episodes', 'special', 'features.The', 'special', 'features', 'menu', 'contains', 'seven', 'options', 'Line', 'Art', 'Gallery', 'Textless', 'Opening', 'Textless', 'Ending', 'Cast', 'List', 'Actor', 'Profiles', 'Ranma', '1/2', 'Cast', 'Wrap', 'Party', 'Ranma', '1/2', 'End', 'Ranma', '1/2', 'Party', 'expected', 'textless', 'opening', 'ending', 'are', 'just', 'opening', 'ending', 'credits', 'text', 'line', 'art', 'gallery', 'twenty-five', 'pages', 'model', 'sketches', 'characters', 'locations', 'appear', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', 'cast', 'list', 'list', 'English', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'actors', 'character', 'actor', 'profiles', 'are', 'selected', 'filmographies', 'English', 'voice', 'actors.The', 'Ranma', '1/2', 'Cast', 'Wrap', 'Party', 'roughly', 'six', 'minute', 'feature', 'interviews', 'English', 'cast', 'intercut', 'footage', 'English', 'dub', 'version', 'Ranma', '1/2', 'However', 'audio', 'quality', 'features', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'fact', 'one', 'voice', 'actor', 'interviewed', 'piece', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hear', 'well', 'enough', 'understand', 'what', 'saying', 'Ranma', '1/2', 'End', 'Ranma', '1/2', 'Party', 'six', 'minute', 'feature', 'fan', 'party', 'celebrating', 'end', 'series', 'feature', 'interviews', 'cast', 'as', 'well', 'fans', 'also', 'intercut', 'footage', 'English', 'dub', 'version', 'Ranma', '1/2', 'one', 'hand', 'applaud', 'Viz', 'Media', 'going', 'effort', 'include', 'final', 'two', 'special', 'features', 'set', 'However', ""'m"", 'disappointed', 'quality', 'two', 'features', 'especially', 'audio', 'quality', 'Cast', 'Wrap', 'Party', 'Even', 'set', 'flaws', 'really', 'should', 'be', 'anime', 'fan', 'DVD', 'collection']",Ranma 1/2: Ranma Forever - Season 7
1153097,AFV2584U13XP3,B0016AK36O,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),"[4, 4]","With this season box set I now have all the Ranma 1/2 seasons and I'm very happy.  This season actually had the appearance of Ranma's true mother for the last two part episodes actually he doesn't get to really see her as male Ranma since his father made an agreement with his mother that if he wasn't a ""Man Among Men"" that both he and his father would commit sepuku(Ritualized suicide).  Also one of the few episodes I really liked was when Akane while trying to see if Ranma was truly meant for her buys some strawberry rice-cakes from a vendor who tells her that if that person was truly meant for her to stay with that after eating the rice cake that cherry blossom marks would appear on their face.  The video is for the most part sharp and pretty clear a little bit better than some of the earlier season box sets and the audio is very good to both Japanese and English voice actors are superb in this series.  With this last season box sets the only extras you get other than the text-less intro/ending songs is the two videos of the English voice actors at a wrap-up party after the final episode and a follow up party to discuss the Ranma series.  So to all Ranma fans who've yet to complete their collection I say with the prices of these sets start getting them today...",5,The Final Season To A Great Anime Series,1217808000,"08 4, 2008",2008,1282,"['season', 'box', 'set', 'now', 'have', 'Ranma', '1/2', 'seasons', ""'m"", 'very', 'happy', 'season', 'actually', 'had', 'appearance', 'Ranma', 'true', 'mother', 'last', 'two', 'part', 'episodes', 'actually', ""n't"", 'get', 'really', 'see', 'male', 'Ranma', 'father', 'made', 'agreement', 'mother', 'was', ""n't"", 'Man', 'Men', 'father', 'would', 'commit', 'sepuku', 'Ritualized', 'suicide', 'Also', 'one', 'few', 'episodes', 'really', 'liked', 'was', 'when', 'Akane', 'trying', 'see', 'Ranma', 'was', 'truly', 'meant', 'buys', 'strawberry', 'rice-cakes', 'vendor', 'who', 'person', 'was', 'truly', 'meant', 'stay', 'eating', 'rice', 'cake', 'cherry', 'blossom', 'marks', 'would', 'appear', 'face', 'video', 'most', 'part', 'sharp', 'pretty', 'clear', 'little', 'bit', 'better', 'earlier', 'season', 'box', 'sets', 'audio', 'very', 'good', 'Japanese', 'English', 'voice', 'actors', 'are', 'superb', 'series', 'last', 'season', 'box', 'only', 'extras', 'get', 'other', 'text-less', 'intro/ending', 'songs', 'two', 'videos', 'English', 'voice', 'actors', 'wrap-up', 'party', 'final', 'episode', 'follow', 'up', 'party', 'discuss', 'Ranma', 'series', 'Ranma', 'fans', 'who', ""'ve"", 'yet', 'complete', 'collection', 'say', 'prices', 'sets', 'start', 'getting', 'today']",Ranma 1/2: Ranma Forever - Season 7
