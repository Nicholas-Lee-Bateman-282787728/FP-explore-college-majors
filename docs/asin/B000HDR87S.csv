1013127,A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL,B000HDR87S,Little Miss Cutey,"[20, 23]","This is one of the funniest shows around.  I really love it.  Chris Rock narrates, while actors act out the story of his childhood when he was 13 years old.  It's about Chris and his family moving out of the projects and making a new start.  Chris goes to school by himself to a good school in an Italian neighborhood (a real long haul) while his two siblings (younger brother Drew and younger sister Tonya go to their same school) so he has to learn to fight new battles as he tries to fit in.  His first day there he faces a bully but also makes a new friend Greg (who couldn't win a fight if he tried).  Back at home there is his dad Julius (played by the hilarious Terry Crews) and his take-no-nonsense mum Rochelle.  His dad is really tight and tries to save money wherever he can and however he can.All the episodes are called Everyone Hates The ... and each episode keeps getting better and better.  To me, my favourite is episode 7 called Everyone Hates The Babysitter.  Julius and Rochelle decide to have a date night and hire this girl to babysit the three kids.  She always leaves the house to take care of her business.  That in itself is funny but then Julius and Rochelle are at a restaurant that doesn't accept their coupon and the restaurant gets robbed.It's such a great show and you will be in stitches watching it.  Chris Rock narrates perfectly and you can see his life coming to life in each episode.  I love it and hope you enjoy it and are as entertained by it as much as I am.  I can't wait to get my copy.",5,So funny ;-),1157155200,"09 2, 2006",2006,1530,"['one', 'funniest', 'shows', 'really', 'love', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'narrates', 'actors', 'act', 'out', 'story', 'childhood', 'when', 'was', '13', 'years', 'old', 'Chris', 'family', 'moving', 'projects', 'making', 'new', 'start', 'Chris', 'school', 'good', 'school', 'Italian', 'neighborhood', 'real', 'long', 'haul', 'two', 'siblings', 'younger', 'brother', 'Drew', 'younger', 'sister', 'Tonya', 'go', 'same', 'school', 'so', 'learn', 'fight', 'new', 'battles', 'fit', 'first', 'day', 'bully', 'also', 'new', 'friend', 'Greg', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'win', 'fight', 'tried', 'Back', 'home', 'dad', 'Julius', 'played', 'hilarious', 'Terry', 'Crews', 'take-no-nonsense', 'mum', 'Rochelle', 'dad', 'really', 'tight', 'tries', 'save', 'money', 'can', 'however', 'episodes', 'are', 'called', 'Everyone', 'episode', 'getting', 'better', 'better', 'favourite', 'episode', '7', 'called', 'Everyone', 'Babysitter', 'Julius', 'Rochelle', 'decide', 'have', 'date', 'night', 'hire', 'girl', 'babysit', 'three', 'kids', 'always', 'house', 'take', 'care', 'business', 'funny', 'then', 'Julius', 'Rochelle', 'are', 'restaurant', ""n't"", 'accept', 'coupon', 'restaurant', 'robbed.It', 'such', 'great', 'show', 'will', 'be', 'stitches', 'watching', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'perfectly', 'can', 'see', 'life', 'coming', 'life', 'episode', 'love', 'hope', 'enjoy', 'are', 'entertained', 'as', 'much', 'am', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'get', 'copy']",N/A
1013128,A31U2QT7SAL7K,B000HDR87S,"Reginald D. Garrard ""the G-man""","[2, 4]","Tyler James Williams has the title role in this comedy gem, now in its second year on the CW Network. Creator (and narrator) Chris Rock has crafted a show that chronicles (with much ""poetic license"") his growing up in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn and paints a warmly humorous look at his family.Williams is perfect as the boy that must deal with home life as the eldest that is held responsible for his younger siblings while dealing with a school where he is an oddity: the only Black person in the school. The latter allows Rock to mix comedy with social commentary, something that he does quite well.The rest of the cast is fantastic. Terry Crews plays the stern and hardworking father, Julius; Tichina Arnold (formerly of Martin Lawrence's series) shines as the mother; Tequan Richmond is Chris's younger but larger and more-appealing-to-the-girls brother Drew; Imani Hakin is Keisha, the sister that makes life miserable for her older sibling; and Vincent Martella plays Chris's only friend at school, Greg.The twenty-two episodes on the disc are self-explanatory and offer a sly nod to the show's premise by containing the words ""Everybody Hates"" in their titles (""Everybody Hates Basketball,"" ""Everybody Hates Sausage,"" "" Everybody Hates Food Stamps,"" and ""Everybody Hates the Gout,"" just to cite a few).The compilation disc also contains cast commentaries on selected episodes and fascinating featurettes on the director/co-creator, the integral part that music plays in the show, and auditions, along with others.The quality of the DVD is excellent and the show is presented in the widescreen format.Hopefully, sales will be strong enough to persuade the release of season two at its end.",5,"The first year of Chris Rock's ""autobiographical"" Emmy-worthy series",1179619200,"05 20, 2007",2007,1716,"['Tyler', 'James', 'Williams', 'title', 'role', 'comedy', 'gem', 'now', 'second', 'year', 'CW', 'Network', 'Creator', 'narrator', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'crafted', 'show', 'much', 'poetic', 'license', 'growing', 'up', 'Bedford-Stuyvesant', 'neighborhood', 'Brooklyn', 'warmly', 'humorous', 'look', 'family.Williams', 'perfect', 'boy', 'must', 'deal', 'home', 'life', 'eldest', 'held', 'responsible', 'younger', 'siblings', 'dealing', 'school', 'where', 'oddity', 'only', 'Black', 'person', 'school', 'latter', 'Rock', 'mix', 'comedy', 'social', 'commentary', 'something', 'quite', 'well.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'fantastic', 'Terry', 'Crews', 'stern', 'hardworking', 'father', 'Julius', 'Tichina', 'Arnold', 'formerly', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'series', 'mother', 'Tequan', 'Richmond', 'Chris', 'younger', 'larger', 'more-appealing-to-the-girls', 'brother', 'Drew', 'Imani', 'Hakin', 'Keisha', 'sister', 'life', 'miserable', 'older', 'sibling', 'Vincent', 'Martella', 'Chris', 'only', 'friend', 'school', 'Greg.The', 'twenty-two', 'episodes', 'disc', 'are', 'self-explanatory', 'offer', 'sly', 'nod', 'show', 'premise', 'containing', 'words', 'Everybody', 'titles', 'Everybody', 'Basketball', 'Everybody', 'Hates', 'Sausage', 'Everybody', 'Food', 'Stamps', 'Everybody', 'Gout', 'just', 'cite', 'few', '.The', 'compilation', 'disc', 'also', 'cast', 'commentaries', 'selected', 'episodes', 'fascinating', 'featurettes', 'director/co-creator', 'integral', 'part', 'music', 'show', 'auditions', 'others.The', 'quality', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'show', 'presented', 'widescreen', 'format.Hopefully', 'sales', 'will', 'be', 'strong', 'enough', 'persuade', 'release', 'season', 'two', 'end']",N/A
1013129,AYZV1PJP6NXPT,B000HDR87S,"R. Long ""JaminRebel""","[0, 0]","I bought season one of ""Everybody Hates Chris"" used at a pawn shop. The lady at the pawn shop let me have the first season for FIVE DOLLARS, so if I hated the show I wouldn't be out much money. Being a white male I wasn't sure I would like this show. I have liked somes shows with mostly black casts but not everything appeals to me. For instance, I never cared for Living Color or the Wayman brothers. However, back in the day I used to watch ""Good Times"" all the time. I also used to watch ""What's Happening"", even though it was not as good as ""Good Times"", imo.Anyway, I must say I got my money's worth and more out of season one. All of the actors are talented. However, in season one I can't say that Chris' brother did much for me at all. I guess it is mostly a question of the concept of the character. That character is simply a chick magnet. That character simply doesn't have to do much. But the father, mother and little sister are all hillarious. I must say though that I think perhaps the mother got too much of a role in the first season, but if the father was always at work then I guess that was what life was all about, life with mom. I love how Chris accused his mother of being a ghetto snob. That is such a riot. The father is a penny pincher, a real cheapo, that is funny too, but not nearly as funny. And the story is so real at times that I feel like slapping the wife. I can just see Chris' mother quitting her jobs telling folks how her man has two or three jobs. And then the mother tries to work from home, another funny concept. I come away feeling sorry for the father though. I think the father is the hero of that family. I also like Chris' friend, he seems like a real buddy and all around good guy. I wanted to see Chris get even with the white red headed bully also, but that didn't happen in season one. Based upon season one I will look for the other three seasons. The show is real good fun. The one thing that got on my nerves in season one though is the THEME SONG. That song got very OLD very QUICK. I started skipping past the theme song because it was really getting on my nerves.Anyway, if you haven't seen this show it is well worth your while. Also, Chris Rock is the narrator, of course, and it's really good fun to hear him narrate the episodes. Also, it is a who's who of black actor special guests on this show, folks like the guy who played J. J. Walker on Good Times, and the guy who played Raj on What's Happening and the guy who played Huggie Bear on Starsky and Hutch, aka, Antonio Vargas. Plus the black guy who was on The Mod Squad was a tenant in one of the episodes. It's fun to see all of these people who are now old.Oh, and the funny perspective of this show is that it is a black guy's perspective of LIFE in a mostly white school. Chris was bused to a white school.",5,Funny perspective for a sitcom. Talented cast.
