705279,A282A0P69UT137,B000068TOM,"Captain Hornblower ""captainhornblower""","[11, 17]","Orignally, Farscape's Season 2 Premiere episode was one called ""Re: Union"".  However, it was decided before the second season aired that the second episode they had filmed, ""Mind the Baby"", would make a more appropriate season premiere (they aired ""Re: Union"" later in the season as ""Dream a Little Dream"", with a few new scenes to make it a story in flashback).""Mind the Baby"" was certainly much better suited to be the season premiere episode.  It picks up after Crichton and D'Argo have been rescued from floating in space by Aeryn (where they were left at the end of Season 1).  They are hiding from the Peacekeepers at an abandoned mining facility on an asteroid.  Aeryn makes supplies runs in her Prowler, but is secretly rendevouzing with someone on these trips.  In the meantime, the rest of Moya's crew is trying to find Crichton, Aeryn, and D'Argo, and so is Scorpius and his command carrier.  They will all collide in a good episode, though one that is a bit rushed in its plot.""Vitas Mortis"", the second episode on the tape, is a very mediocre episode about D'Argo's encounter with a Luxan holy woman on a planet.  She will manipulate D'Argo into helping her, but these actions will put Moya in danger.  Really, this episode is good for a one time see, but is not very interesting and rather boring.  This is one of the few Farscape episodes that was not really that great.So you've got one good episode and one mediocre episode on this first volume.

Farscape fans, such as myself, have been waiting patiently for over a year to see Farscape in DVD Box sets. ADV has released a ""Best of"" collection but that isn't going to cut it. What the producers think the best episode is many other people will disagree on. I thought ""Through the Looking Glass"" was the best episode in Season one. And agian, many people will disagree with me. That is the basis to releasing Box Sets. You get it all.StarGate SG-1 fans got what they wanted when companies began doing what they do with Farscape, releasing seasons little by little. They got Box Sets. Good Box Sets. Region 2 DVD owners have a little bit of an advantage with Farcsape DVD's. They get season releases in three sections, with 6-8 episodes in each set. But even that will not cut the list to most fans.A show with so many awards and so much more ahead of it should be granted a good DVD realease.

705282,A2HKBL4AP6WHEN,B000068TOM,"John Kahane ""book and movie lover""","[0, 0]","Well, the Second Season of FARSCAPE has started out on dvd with the release of the double DVD from the folks at ADV Films.  It contains two dvds with a couple of episodes on each, but overall the package is something of a disappointment.The first DVD holds the first two episodes of the 2nd Season of FARSCAPE, ""Mind the Baby"" and ""Vitas Mortis.""  Well, technically, ""Mind the Baby"" is the second episode of the season because originally, the plan was to start the season off with an episode called ""Re:Union,"" but it was felt that the fans needed to know what happened to Crichton, Aeryn, and D'Argo immediately after the end of the first season finale ""Family Ties.""  ""Mind the Baby"" is the story that concerns the rescue of Crichton and D'Argo by Aeryn, the deal she has to strike with one-half of our villainous duo, Crais and Scorpius, and the search on the part of the other half of the duo for Moya and her offspring, Talyn.  This is very much a character-driven episode in which the actions and motivations of much of the cast are explored in new ways, and where Crais may well surprise viewers with his actions, although he appears to be playing a dangerous game with Scorpius throughout.  While Chiana, Zhaan, and Rygel have very little to do in this story, it is one that lays a lot of groundwork for the rest of the Season 2 material, and hints at several ominous aspects of the season.  The second episode on this first DVD, ""Vitas Mortis,"" brings Crichton, Zhaan and D'Argo to a planet in search of a Luxan who turns out be an ancient Orican, one of the Luxan holy women, whom D'Argo agrees to aid in her Ritual of Passage.  When she instead invigorates herself and regains her youth, it is Moya who suffers, however.  The story has some very good character development in it, and the relationship between Chiana and Aeryn becomes clearer.  D'Argo shines in this story, and that is all too the good.The second DVD begins with ""Taking the Stone,"" the tale of Chiana's joining a gang of drug-taking, risk-taking young men and women on a Royal Cemetary Planet, as a result of her trying to come to terms with her brother's (supposed) death after the life disc she has implanted in her stops working.  Aeryn and Crichton go down to the planet where they try to retrieve her, while Rygel makes off with spoils from the planet's cemetary plots - as it turns out, haunted spoils.  This is a somewhat weak episode in many ways, but certainly gives Gigi Edgley's Chiana a starring role and goes into her motivations and background a bit more without becoming too obvious.  Another episode that is a lead-in to upcoming plots and material for Season 2, but still a weak episode.  The DVD positively sparkles, however, with the fourth episode, ""Crackers Don't Matter,"" in which the arrival of the alien T'raltixx on Moya puts the crew at odds with one another in very spectacular (and somewhat violent) fashion.  It is an episode that has Crichton playing the knight in tarnished armour, and features some wonderful characterisation and over-the-top acting by various members of Moya's crew - including Pilot.Where this double DVD set fails to please is in the special features.  First, the episodes on these DVDs are only about 45 minutes long, indicating no additional, unseen material in them, although there are two deleted scenes on each DVD.  The first DVD has two scenes from ""Mind the Baby"" and nothing from ""Vitas Mortis,"" while the second DVD has a scene each from ""Taking the Stone"" and ""Crackers Don't Matter"" (and this latter one is a marvellous scene that really should have been on the DVD version episode).  I have no idea whether there were other deleted scenes that could have been added to this DVD set or not, but this material seems somewhat skimpy when all is said and done.  There is only one commentary version on this double DVD, and that is Claudia Black and director Ian Watson on ""Crackers Don't Matter.""  The commentary has little to do with the episode itself, but does reveal a lot about Claudia Black, acting, and some directorial wisdom.  However, there should have been commentaries on this for each of the episodes to really make the DVD worthwhile.  The rest of the special features - the John Crichton Backstory, Ben Browder Actor Profile, Alien Encounters, Farscape Alien Slang - are all *text* files that contain nothing that isn't elsewhere on the internet.  I don't know how much input Henson had to this ""content"" but it is highly disappointing and seriously annoying on a double DVD that cost ...at regular prices!  The Conceptual Artwork features are quite good, but when it comes down to it, this pair of DVDs cost far too much for the most part, especially in light of some of the special features on the British DVDs that seem to come out more frequently than the American ones.When all is said and done, the Season 2, Volume 1 FARSCAPE double DVD is worth the cost merely to have the four episodes on an excellent quality medium, but is still far pricier than other products of its sort.  ADV Films is doing an injustice to the folks who love FARSCAPE and want the series on DVD, but there is no other means to get the episodes short of purchasing the UK DVDs (and a player to view them on) or to just tape them off the television.  I have very mixed feelings about the quality of this DVD,  but the commentary for ""Crackers Don't Matter"" makes up for this in some ways.",3,Farscape Season 2 DVDs Begin With a

705284,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000068TOM,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 1]","Season 1 of ""Farscape"" ended with as many cliffhangers as they could cram into the season finale. We had Crichton (Ben Browder) and D'Argo (Anthony Simcoe) floating in space; Moya new born baby boy turns out to have built-in Peacekeeper technology, which thrills Captain Crais (Lani John Tupu); Aeryn (Claudia Black) in a Prowler hiding from Scorpius (Wayne Pygram); and Moya starbursts away with Zhaan (Virginia Hey), Chiana (Gigi Edgley), and Rigel. To be fair, there was no ""To Be Continued"" announcement for that season finale, probably because the fate of the show was still up in the air, but with the ""Farscape"" crew scattered to the winds of space there was a sense of anticipation as to how they were going to get out of their respective messes.That is why ""Mind the Baby"" is such a great disappointment. When I started watching the episode I thought I had the wrong one in the machine because suddenly Crichton and D'Argo are no longer in space. They must have saved a small fortune not having to do the special effects to show how this happened, but it comes across as a cheat to me. It really go the whole episode off on the wrong foot for me and every new revelation as to how things would be different in Season 2 ended up being met with skepticism. I liked the second episode, ""Vitas Mortis"" a lot better, which is rather ironic because the story has absolutely nothing to do with any of the new plot elements that were just established. D'Argo meets up with another Luxan, a Orican (holy woman) named Nilaam, who wants him to attend to her death. However, their association has unexpected consequences, both for the two Luxans and for Moya. This look at Luxan culture is rather brief, but it does give D'Argo some new depth to go along with the dark skin colors he picked up floating around in space between the first two seasons. After all the new information thrown at us in the previous episode, a character study of one of Moya's crew other than Crichton stands us in good stead.Chiana takes center stage in ""Taking the Stone,"" when she is driven by grief to visit a Royal Cemetary planet where she joins a group of decadent youngsters who engage in ritualistic jumping off of cliffs to test death.  The group is led by Molon (Anthony Hayes), who has even more disdain for the visitors than he does for his own people.  Meanwhile, Crichton is trying to convince Chiana not to ""take the stone.""  This episode reminds me of the ""Star Trek"" episode ""Miri,"" although Chaina provides it with much more emotional depth.  ""Crackers Don't Matter"" is one of those episodes where the characters are driven semi-insane by alien forces and the actors get to cut loose (the cunning Pilot was my favorite).  Behind it all is Traltixx (Danny Adcock), who was called in to help make Moya undetectable to sensors and instead is making her walls glow.  However, it is only the fourth episode of the second season, so why would the cast need a change of pace episode already?The DVD extras are pretty much a mixed bag, especially after the above average batch of additives from the first season set. There is a character backstory on John Crichton and an actor biography of Ben Browder, but they are both text pages that you have to flip through rather than filmed featurettes; they are also rather brief.  There is a commentary track on ""Crackers Don't Matter,"" which is mostly actress Claudia Black interviewing director Ian Watson about his craft in general.  There are several deleted scenes just for something different this time around and more pages offering a look at the alien encounter with Nilaam and some conceptual drawings, including nice costume drawings for Nilamm.  Finally, there is the Farscape Dictionary of alien slang so you can know  what ""blez,"" ""frodank,"" and ""loomas"" mean.  So these end up being rather average episodes of ""Farscape,"" although obvious the season premiere is setting the stage for what is to come.

705285,A1MN1Y3QNUFRBE,B000068TOM,"Robert W. Berg ""Rob""","[52, 55]","No, ""Farscape"" is not yet being put into full season sets, but this is a vast improvement. As the plan goes now, a new 2-disc set will be released each month, with 4-5 episodes on each. And that's much better than only 2 episodes, every few months, as we've previously been getting.""Farscape"" is, bar none, the best science-fiction on TV. It's daring, bold, insane, whimsical, scary, and fun...and also has one of the most complex, involving, and brilliant mythologies of any sci-fi out there, including some fascinating stuff about wormholes.With that said, on to the episode reviews...""Mind the Baby"" is an excellent season-opener that picks up from the season finale with a punch, and leads the show into its new direction for the new year. Its only weakness is the fact that it was not originally meant to be the season-opener, but the second episode. The first one was aired later in the season, and turned into a flashback episode, where we find out what happened. Therefore, some of the aspects of the previous season finale cliffhanger are strangely resolved without an explanation...Although that explanation will be given later in the season, in the episode, ""Dream a Little Dream.""The next 2 episodes, unfortunately, are not the best ""Farscape"" has to offer. ""Taking the Stone"" and ""Vitas Mortis"" are both rather slow, unexciting episodes. Although each focuses on a different character and provides some great, sometimes crucial, character development, the actual stories don't pack the right amount of punch. That is not to say that they are not worth watching. Just they are not as good as they should have been.The fourth episode of the set, however, is the crown jewel of the 4, and completely makes up for the minor weaknesses of ""Mind the Baby"" and the more serious ones of the other two. ""Crackers Don't Matter"" is an utterly brilliant, demented, hilarious, black comedy that strikes a perfect balance between the dark and the funny. It is one of the best episodes the show has ever done. It's impossible to describe the episode without giving it away, but, suffice it to say, it is brillant on every level: character-wise, plot-wise, comedy-wise, drama-wise...Very few shows can produce an episode that can make you laugh till it hurts, and cringe, also. It also greatly benefits from being an episode with a stand-alone plot which also speaks a great deal aobut the characters, and foreshadows the major story arc of the year, something that won't come completely into focus and be fully revealed until much later in the year, in the ingenious ""Won't Get Fooled Again,"" which will take away its crown as the best episode up to that point.What is great about ""Farscape"" is how it always manages to top itself. Therefore, ""Crackers Don't Matter"" was the best episode for a while, until ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" took its place, which was then taken by the season finale, ""Die Me Dichotomy."" And that doesn't even factor in the two brilliant trilogies: ""Look at the Princess"" and ""Liars, Guns, and Money.""
