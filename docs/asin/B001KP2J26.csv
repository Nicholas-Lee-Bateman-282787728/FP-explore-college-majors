1208433,A3OWMX70M5NXVQ,B001KP2J26,"Aaron F. ""aaronfissel""","[21, 23]","Hulk Vs. is so far the best animated film created by Marvel. Both short films are full of graphic violence, great animation, and the characters are played as they should be. Even the storylines are great in this DVD!Hulk Vs. Wolverine: Logan is assigned to take down the monstrous Hulk as he tears apart the Canadian countryside. Or is it really the Hulk alone who is causing all the damage? Wolverine soon finds out that Sabretooth, Omega Red, Lady DeathStrike, and Deadpool have been hunting the Hulk for the Weapon X program and attempt to use the most powerful monster on the planet as a weapon. But Lady DeathStrike and the others have other plans.Hulk Vs. Thor: Odin is asleep and it seems that all of Asgard's enemies have been defeated. But Loki has captured Bruce Banner and plans to unleash the Hulk and destroy Thor. But can Loki truelly control such a savage and powerful monster? For not even Thor nor any God has the strength or the power to stop the Hulk!My addvice, buy this DVD set. If you are true fan of the core material of the comics, then this DVD is for you. However, beware it is extremely graphic and should not be seen by those under the age of 13. The bonous features are a great treat and plus we get a look at Thor: Tales Of Asgard. So, what are you waiting for? Buy now and enjoy!",5,Hulk Vs. Wolverine & Hulk Vs.

1208439,AVIG0TFY9CDPD,B001KP2J26,"Baton Rouge Brent ""Purplehound!""","[0, 0]","I just had the opportunity to check out the new Marvel/Lionsgate direct-to-dvd animated film, ""Hulk Vs."" and was pretty pleased overall.First off, unlike previous entries in the Marvel animated films, this one is NOT a regular feature-length presentation.  It instead consists of two separate and unrelated stories.  The artwork was either pretty darned good (Thor) or excellent (Wolverine).  The animation itself is extremely good.  The previews on the disc are for the new animated series ""Wolverine and the X-Men"" and the next animated dvd movie ""Thor: Tales of Asgard"", which looks brilliant and is due in September.""Hulk Vs. Wolverine"" was the feature I enjoyed best but it had its weaknesses.  Its strengths are the characterization, the art and animation, and the beuatiful background paintings of the Canadian wilderness.  The weaknesses are that if you happen to be a casual viewer and are not familiar with the backstories of Wolverine and the Weapon X program, you will become lost very quickly.  There are a series of flashbacks that I felt were porly integrated into the story.  It was a little unclear (especially for casual viewers) that these were actually flashbacks and not occuring in real-time, thus causing a bit of confusion.  Also, to truly appreciate the villains (Sabretooth, Deadpool, Omega Red, and Lady Deathstrike), one needs to be familiar with them and their personalities from the comic books.  The action itself is brutal, violent, and non-stop--a hardcore beatdown that comic fans will love!""Hulk Vs. Thor"" was also quite good, but I simply didn't enjoy it quite as much.  The animation, artwork, and characterizartion were all excellent, though.  I think my reaction is based on my own personal preference for darker material, which ""Hulk Vs. Wolverine"" dafinitely catered to.  In the Thor story, Asgard is (as it should be) bright, gleaming, and beautiful.  Again, the action is quite good, although not as brutal as in the previous tale.  Fans of the Marvel take on Norse mythology will be quite pleased as lots of mythical figures are featured and various realms of Asgard are visited.  Magic, myth, and even a bit of romance dominate this tale and the Hulk is as dangerous as ever, even against immortals.I watched this with my wife, who has enjoyed most of the previous superhero movies, animated or otherwise.  The difference is that I am a comic fan who is familiar with the characters and their backstories and she is not.  So from an objective point of view, I can say that the ""Hulk Vs. Wolverine"" story left her a bit confused and unsatisfied.  She enjoyed the Thor storyline far better as it isn't quite so dependent on knowing the characters and their backstories.  She is also a great fan of fantasy and mythology, so Thor was right up her alley.Because of the brutal violence (which includes dismemberment) in the Wolverine story, I wouldn't recomend it for kids under 12.  I would be comfortable showing the Thor story to kids of 5 or older.  Of course, you should know your own children's ability to handle and process action and violence in a healthy way, so I'm just mentioning my own assesment.  Take it for what it's worth to you.Keep the excellent animated movies coming, Marvel!

1208440,A3GKMQFL05Z79K,B001KP2J26,blackaciddevil,"[1, 1]","In my opinion, Hulk Vs. has to be Marvel Animation's crowning achievement, thus far. After 5 great direct-to-DVD features, it finally gives us (not one but two) features with the right amount of exciting comic-book storytelling, thrilling action and cutting-edge animation to bring every comic fan's dream to the small screen. This 2-disc DVD set features 'twice the carnage' with Hulk Vs. Wolverine and Hulk Vs. Thor.Disc 1:Hulk Vs. Wolverine. This feature starts off with the two battling from the very beginning. You soon find out that The Hulk has been leaving a path of destruction all over the canadian countryside and he needs to be stopped at all costs. So, the government calls in the only man that can truly take on the green giant: Wolverine. That leads us back to the battle. Yet, members of the Weapon X program(Deadpool, Omega Red, Sabretooth, and Lady Deathstrike) are pursuing The Hulk as a means of turning him into a weapon(not only to destroy Wolverine but to use to their benefit). That's when things get nasty. The remainder of the feature has The Hulk & Wolverine battling them instead of each other, actually. Bonus features include:Audio Commentary, three featurettes(including a first look at Wolverine & The X-Men) and a trailer gallery. While the story was alright and it had its' moments, I still loved it. Seeing Hulk and Wolverine square off(at least, a little bit) was well worth it.Disc 2:Hulk Vs. Thor. While Odin(Asgard's protector and ruler) is taking his winter slumber, Loki(Thor's evil stepbrother) decides to sieze the opportunity to bring Thor and Asgard to their knees by bringing The Hulk to Asgard. With the help of The Enchantress, Loki separates Bruce Banner from The Hulk and takes control of The Hulk's functions attempting to storm the kingdom. However, The Hulk isn't so easily controlled and he's soon creating chaos all his own. Loki soon realizes that his only recourse is to reunite The Hulk with Bruce Banner. Only Bruce is in Hela's Realm(or Hell, as I'm taking it) and it takes Loki and Thor both to bring them both back together to stop the Hulk from bringing Ragnarok down on Asgard and bringing about the end of days for the godly paradise. Bonus features here include:Audio Commentary, several featurettes, a first look at ""Thor:Tales of Asgard"" and a trailer gallery as well. You'll notice there is a different look to this feature. Hulk himself has longer hair, thicker limbs and a bigger body. I like this as it stands as its' own feature, even though it is part of a larger one. Overall, I loved this feature better(and I hate to admit it but I've never been a fan of Thor). It has a more epic feel to it and feels more cohesive in its' plot. There's more characters from Thor's universe here as well so it doesn't just center around the two.You can tell Marvel Animation loves The Hulk as he has been in 4 of 6 of their animated efforts.I really loved this Special Edition DVD set and look forward to Marvel Animation's coming projects. Here's hoping that they continue the VS. series in some way. I'd love to see The Hulk go up against some of Marvel's other characters(like The Thing, Wendigo, or Red/Grey Hulk).",5,Hulk Vs. .............,1233360000,"01 31, 2009",2009,3179,"['opinion', 'Hulk', 'Vs.', 'be', 'Marvel', 'Animation', 'crowning', 'achievement', 'thus', 'far', '5', 'great', 'direct-to-DVD', 'features', 'finally', 'not', 'one', 'two', 'features', 'right', 'amount', 'exciting', 'comic-book', 'storytelling', 'thrilling', 'action', 'cutting-edge', 'animation', 'bring', 'comic', 'fan', 'dream', 'small', 'screen', '2-disc', 'DVD', 'set', 'features', ""'twice"", 'carnage', 'Hulk', 'Vs.', 'Wolverine', 'Hulk', 'Vs.', 'Thor.Disc', '1', 'Hulk', 'Vs.', 'Wolverine', 'feature', 'two', 'battling', 'very', 'beginning', 'soon', 'find', 'out', 'Hulk', 'been', 'leaving', 'path', 'destruction', 'canadian', 'countryside', 'be', 'stopped', 'costs', 'So', 'government', 'only', 'man', 'can', 'truly', 'take', 'green', 'giant', 'Wolverine', 'back', 'battle', 'members', 'Weapon', 'X', 'program', 'Deadpool', 'Omega', 'Red', 'Sabretooth', 'Lady', 'Deathstrike', 'are', 'pursuing', 'Hulk', 'means', 'turning', 'weapon', 'not', 'only', 'destroy', 'Wolverine', 'use', 'benefit', 'when', 'things', 'get', 'nasty', 'remainder', 'feature', 'Hulk', 'Wolverine', 'battling', 'instead', 'other', 'actually', 'Bonus', 'include', 'Audio', 'Commentary', 'three', 'featurettes', 'including', 'first', 'look', 'Wolverine', 'X-Men', 'trailer', 'gallery', 'story', 'was', 'alright', 'had', 'moments', 'still', 'loved', 'Seeing', 'Hulk', 'Wolverine', 'square', 'least', 'little', 'bit', 'was', 'well', 'worth', 'it.Disc', '2', 'Hulk', 'Vs.', 'Thor', 'Odin', 'Asgard', 'protector', 'ruler', 'taking', 'winter', 'slumber', 'Loki', 'Thor', 'evil', 'stepbrother', 'sieze', 'opportunity', 'bring', 'Thor', 'Asgard', 'knees', 'bringing', 'Hulk', 'Asgard', 'help', 'Enchantress', 'Loki', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'Hulk', 'control', 'Hulk', 'functions', 'attempting', 'storm', 'kingdom', 'However', 'Hulk', ""n't"", 'so', 'easily', 'controlled', 'soon', 'creating', 'chaos', 'own', 'Loki', 'soon', 'only', 'recourse', 'reunite', 'Hulk', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'Only', 'Bruce', 'Hela', 'Realm', 'Hell', ""'m"", 'taking', 'Loki', 'Thor', 'bring', 'back', 'together', 'stop', 'Hulk', 'bringing', 'Ragnarok', 'down', 'Asgard', 'bringing', 'end', 'days', 'godly', 'paradise', 'Bonus', 'here', 'include', 'Audio', 'Commentary', 'several', 'featurettes', 'first', 'look', 'Thor', 'Tales', 'Asgard', 'trailer', 'gallery', 'as', 'well', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'different', 'look', 'feature', 'Hulk', 'longer', 'hair', 'thicker', 'limbs', 'bigger', 'body', 'like', 'own', 'feature', 'even', 'part', 'larger', 'one', 'Overall', 'loved', 'feature', 'better', 'hate', 'admit', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'fan', 'Thor', 'more', 'epic', 'feel', 'more', 'cohesive', 'plot', 'more', 'characters', 'Thor', 'universe', 'here', 'as', 'well', ""n't"", 'just', 'center', 'around', 'two.You', 'can', 'tell', 'Marvel', 'Animation', 'Hulk', 'been', '4', '6', 'animated', 'efforts.I', 'really', 'loved', 'Special', 'Edition', 'DVD', 'set', 'look', 'forward', 'Marvel', 'Animation', 'coming', 'projects', 'Here', 'hoping', 'continue', 'VS.', 'series', 'way', ""'d"", 'love', 'see', 'Hulk', 'go', 'up', 'Marvel', 'other', 'characters', 'Thing', 'Wendigo', 'Red/Grey', 'Hulk']",Hulk Vs.

The story lines were pretty well thought out too but not too deep and that's fine since there are two short stories here and where the hulk is involved with a title that has `vs.' in it I knew what I wanted from it and they knew how to provide it. Needless to say, I wasn't expecting much when I rented this and was pleasantly surprised to see story development beyond what one might expect from a movie made up of two short stories. The action was intense and over the top in a great way.BUT........ I what I enjoyed even more was watching both Thor and wolverine get the absolute crap kicked out of them. Oh yeah, Hulk destroys them both and I loved every minute of it. Both stories showcase the hulk's immense power and unstopability and believe me he goes ALL out here especially in the Thor story. Sadly due to wolverine's popularity dear wolvy didn't take quite the beating Thor did which was a shame since I have always believed wolverine is an overrated character and really deserved the beating Thor took but oh well, he still got `it' handed to him and that was good enough for me.Great animation, great storylines and great action.

1208444,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B001KP2J26,Caleb Williams,"[0, 1]","Well not really being that into comic books and their characters (apart from the live action adaptations) I didn't really have high expectations of this, but I must say I genuinely enjoyed it. I have only managed to catch Hulk vs. Wolverine so far, but I will add my two cents in regards to Hulk vs. Thor when I've viewed that.Hulk vs. Wolverine had a runtime by my calculations of around 37 minutes, so I really wasn't going to get a genuine plot or that much character depth. Well the story starts with X-Man, Wolverine being called into a remote and snowy location in which a small town has fell victim to the wrath of what the Americans call the Hulk. Wolverine must stop the Hulk before he finds another small town, but little does Wolverine know, all is not what it seems and Wolverine finds himself being re-united with his creator and some of his biggest enemies including Sabre tooth and Lady Death strike.The overall tone of the piece is simply the violence of it all; there's no real dialogue that has any relevance and the plot is very basic even for an animation this short on time. I guess this is something definitely and primarily aimed at the types of people who have read the comics for years and have been begging for this to happen for twice as long. Who am I to know, maybe it's already happened in paper form and Marvel just took the decision to animate it for a new audience. Either way it's entertaining as hell.I only gave it 3 stars for a number of reasons. Although it was genuinely better than I originally imagined, it didn't do anything for me that will have me remember it for a time. The brutality of some of the fights between Hulk and Wolverine made me cringe with the ferocity of it. There were times when I thought the violence was a bit too over the top and just un-necessary, but was still enjoyable. The characters were as you would expect them to be. Hulk is just a mindless violent beast and Wolverine is also a mindless violent beast who actually loves a good fight.Another reason for just giving it 3 stars is that they're called all new Marvel movies. But what exactly constitutes the moniker of movie? Hulk vs. Wolverine was just over 35 minutes long and I have no doubt that Hulk vs. Thor will be roughly the same length. Even if you label the two of them as one combined piece, the length I still wouldn't define as a movie. The cover of the DVD appears much better than that of the animation within the film. Don't get me wrong, the animation isn't anywhere near awful or anything like that, but it's just very basic stuff that we've seen time and time again.I would say that if you're thinking of checking this out, then you really need to be one of the guys who reads the comics and has wanted this for years. If not then you'll probably end up like me and although enjoying it, you'll feel like it didn't really serve any sort of purpose or explain anything to you.",4,Better Than I Expected,1237852800,"03 24, 2009",2009,2916,"['Well', 'not', 'really', 'being', 'comic', 'books', 'characters', 'apart', 'live', 'action', 'adaptations', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'high', 'expectations', 'must', 'say', 'genuinely', 'enjoyed', 'have', 'only', 'managed', 'catch', 'Hulk', 'vs.', 'Wolverine', 'so', 'far', 'will', 'add', 'two', 'cents', 'regards', 'Hulk', 'vs.', 'Thor', 'when', ""'ve"", 'viewed', 'that.Hulk', 'vs.', 'Wolverine', 'had', 'runtime', 'calculations', '37', 'minutes', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'get', 'genuine', 'plot', 'much', 'character', 'depth', 'Well', 'story', 'X-Man', 'Wolverine', 'being', 'called', 'remote', 'snowy', 'location', 'small', 'town', 'fell', 'victim', 'wrath', 'what', 'Americans', 'call', 'Hulk', 'Wolverine', 'must', 'stop', 'Hulk', 'small', 'town', 'little', 'Wolverine', 'know', 'not', 'what', 'Wolverine', 'being', 're-united', 'creator', 'biggest', 'enemies', 'including', 'Sabre', 'tooth', 'Lady', 'Death', 'strike.The', 'overall', 'tone', 'piece', 'simply', 'violence', 'real', 'dialogue', 'relevance', 'plot', 'very', 'basic', 'even', 'animation', 'short', 'time', 'guess', 'something', 'definitely', 'primarily', 'aimed', 'types', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'comics', 'years', 'have', 'been', 'begging', 'happen', 'twice', 'long', 'Who', 'am', 'know', 'maybe', 'already', 'happened', 'paper', 'form', 'Marvel', 'just', 'took', 'decision', 'animate', 'new', 'audience', 'way', 'entertaining', 'hell.I', 'only', 'gave', '3', 'stars', 'number', 'reasons', 'was', 'genuinely', 'better', 'originally', 'imagined', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'will', 'have', 'remember', 'time', 'brutality', 'fights', 'Hulk', 'Wolverine', 'made', 'cringe', 'ferocity', 'were', 'times', 'when', 'thought', 'violence', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'top', 'just', 'un-necessary', 'was', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'characters', 'were', 'would', 'expect', 'be', 'Hulk', 'just', 'mindless', 'violent', 'beast', 'Wolverine', 'also', 'mindless', 'violent', 'beast', 'who', 'actually', 'good', 'fight.Another', 'reason', 'just', 'giving', '3', 'stars', ""'re"", 'called', 'new', 'Marvel', 'movies', 'what', 'exactly', 'moniker', 'movie', 'Hulk', 'vs.', 'Wolverine', 'was', 'just', '35', 'minutes', 'long', 'have', 'doubt', 'Hulk', 'vs.', 'Thor', 'will', 'be', 'roughly', 'same', 'length', 'Even', 'label', 'two', 'one', 'combined', 'piece', 'length', 'still', 'would', ""n't"", 'define', 'movie', 'cover', 'DVD', 'much', 'better', 'animation', 'film', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'animation', ""n't"", 'anywhere', 'near', 'awful', 'anything', 'just', 'very', 'basic', 'stuff', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'time', 'time', 'again.I', 'would', 'say', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'checking', 'out', 'then', 'really', 'need', 'be', 'one', 'guys', 'who', 'reads', 'comics', 'wanted', 'years', 'not', 'then', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'end', 'up', 'enjoying', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'serve', 'sort', 'purpose', 'explain', 'anything']",Hulk Vs.

This DVD is on 37 minute tale of Hulk Vs. Wolverine, the second a 45 minute tale of  Hulk Vs Thor.  For summaries of the storylines, you can look at many of the other reviews or the product description.I must say, I purchased this single disc edition and am very pleased with the set up. The package is a slipcase 3d lenticular motion picture that alternates between Hulk-Thor and Hulk-Wolverine.  The disc set up has a master menu, then two sub menus for Hulk vs Thor and Hulk Vs Wolverine, and corresponding commentary and previews are under each sub menu.  I am not sure if the two disc edition gains much on this one, other than two making of features (one for Thor and one for Wolverine).  The only version I would see gaining the worth of a higher price is the Blu-Ray because of the better picture and the makings of feature.The action/battle scenes are unparalleled in any of the other animated features by marvel, and by far much more violent and bloody, earning the PG-13 rating.  Definitely a parental guidance needed prior to younger kids watching.  My only qualm is that the animation is not quite as detailed as past marvel projects such as Dr. Strange, Iron Man, and Ultimate Avengers.  The character faces and shadows are not set in the same tone, not a big deal, but a few of the scenes with the Hulk I was distracted a bit by the simplicity of his face up close. It looked more of Saturday morning cartoon rather than feature film/movie quality animation.  The effect of pure rage was still not lost though, but it could have been helpful. I am somewhat fearful of the previews for Thor Tales of Asgard  and  Wolverine and the X-Men mainly because I feel Marvel may be jumping on the prequel bandwagon which usually ends up in many inconsistencies and sore feelings from longtime fans, and a potential further quality drop in animation detail.Overall, longtime fans will not be disappointed with this in the long haul, and for two short movies that keep you saying ""ouch"" at the thunderous punches and brutal blows, this DVD has it.",4,Good new storyline to the Hulk series,1233705600,"02 4, 2009",2009,2202,"['Hulk', 'pretty', 'much', 'appeared', 'most', 'marvel', 'storylines', 'two', 'mini', 'features', 'blend', 'nicely', 'characters', 'involved', 'histories', 'DVD', '37', 'minute', 'tale', 'Hulk', 'Vs.', 'Wolverine', 'second', '45', 'minute', 'tale', 'Hulk', 'Vs', 'Thor', 'summaries', 'storylines', 'can', 'look', 'many', 'other', 'reviews', 'product', 'description.I', 'must', 'say', 'purchased', 'single', 'disc', 'edition', 'am', 'very', 'pleased', 'set', 'up', 'package', 'slipcase', '3d', 'lenticular', 'motion', 'picture', 'Hulk-Thor', 'Hulk-Wolverine', 'disc', 'set', 'up', 'master', 'menu', 'then', 'two', 'sub', 'menus', 'Hulk', 'vs', 'Thor', 'Hulk', 'Vs', 'Wolverine', 'corresponding', 'commentary', 'previews', 'are', 'sub', 'menu', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'two', 'disc', 'edition', 'gains', 'much', 'one', 'other', 'two', 'making', 'features', 'one', 'Thor', 'one', 'Wolverine', 'only', 'version', 'would', 'see', 'gaining', 'worth', 'higher', 'price', 'Blu-Ray', 'better', 'picture', 'makings', 'feature.The', 'action/battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'unparalleled', 'other', 'animated', 'features', 'marvel', 'far', 'much', 'more', 'violent', 'bloody', 'earning', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'Definitely', 'parental', 'guidance', 'needed', 'prior', 'younger', 'kids', 'watching', 'only', 'qualm', 'animation', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'detailed', 'past', 'marvel', 'projects', 'such', 'Dr', 'Strange', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Ultimate', 'Avengers', 'character', 'shadows', 'are', 'not', 'set', 'same', 'tone', 'not', 'big', 'deal', 'few', 'scenes', 'Hulk', 'was', 'distracted', 'bit', 'simplicity', 'face', 'up', 'close', 'looked', 'more', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'cartoon', 'rather', 'feature', 'film/movie', 'quality', 'animation', 'effect', 'pure', 'rage', 'was', 'still', 'not', 'lost', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'helpful', 'am', 'somewhat', 'fearful', 'previews', 'Thor', 'Tales', 'Asgard', 'Wolverine', 'X-Men', 'mainly', 'feel', 'Marvel', 'may', 'be', 'jumping', 'prequel', 'bandwagon', 'usually', 'up', 'many', 'inconsistencies', 'sore', 'feelings', 'longtime', 'fans', 'potential', 'further', 'quality', 'drop', 'animation', 'detail.Overall', 'longtime', 'fans', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'long', 'haul', 'two', 'short', 'movies', 'keep', 'saying', 'ouch', 'thunderous', 'punches', 'brutal', 'blows', 'DVD']",Hulk Vs.

There is such potential there, but they have dropped the ball over and over.  DC really has it together and the Justice League Unlimited cartoon is argueably the best animated superhero cartoon of all time.  Marvel has opted to use sub par animators with stories better suited to small children.  This is the movie that is redeeming themOut of the two, Hulk vs. wolverine is by far the best.  The story for Hulk vs. Thor is very good, but the animation is much like some of there recent releases.  It looks like the X-men Evolution series mixed with Ultimate Avengers.  The character designs are straight out of the comic and the story is something that would appear in a comic.  This alone is better than anything Marvel has done, now on to the good stuff.When I say the preview to Hulk vs. Wolverine, I figured that it was the best scene in the movie.  Seeing wolverine dripping blood from his mouth and then forcing his arm into place, seeing the hulk and jumping out of the way at the last second was amazing.  It really just got better and better.  The animation is very original.  It is very stylized and really made Wolverine out to be the animal he truly is.  The dialogue was great, they really pinned Wolverine and the hulk was awesome.Marvel has finally outdone themselves with this animation.  To often they tone everything down and alter their properties to be safe for kids and the general public.  They water their characters down so that anybody who knows nothing about any of the characters can follow along.  This is one for the comic fans.  This cartoon was straight out of the comics!  They even had a scene where the Hulk's reflection was flashed in Wolverine's claws like the famous McFarlene cover!  The fight is brutal!  Wolverine is a complete animal and the hulk is giant!  Wolverine slices him and lets the blood fly!!!  The hulk is a monster and beats wolverine to a pulp, it just goes back and forth.This movie also has some great appearances by Deadpool, Lady Deathstrike, Omega Red and Sabretooth.  They are done properly!  Sabretooth is a psycho like the comics, not the sniveling lackey they potray in the movies.  Deadpool is hilarious as well!  You even get to see Wolvie in his Weapon X gear.  They took a little leeway by adding all these characters to weapon x, but the fight were brutal.This is a must have for marvel fans!  Finally a cartoon for fans of the comic, finally they nailed wolverine as well.

1208451,A1FJ4WAOIDPEF4,B001KP2J26,David J. Brown,"[0, 0]","*** and 1/2 stars actually.Okay, first let me state I love almost all things comic book.  I read comics religeously when I was younger right up until about the time I turned 14 or so.  Around that time I got interested in filmmaking and videography and theatre.  I was always able to draw and design graphically so there was always a possibility that comics was a field for me to go into, but then filmmaking consumed my being.  Anyway, I tell you all this because I want to make clear that I can't stand fan-boys(those annoying little gnats who didn't like Spider-Man simply because his web-shooters were changed to being biological as opposed to made by him) and I haven't read a comic since the 90's.  I do love comic book movies, and am very happy they are practically a genre by themselves at this point, but I want a satisfying film experience, and not random crap that has nothing to do with the movie's arch, plot or character development just because comic nerds will have a joygasmn over it.  Movies are not books, they're not comics, they're not tv shows.  They're their own beast and create a whole other universe for familar and unfamilar characters alike to exist.Okay, now onto Hulk VS.  This is purely for comic book nerds and fans.  There are very little backstories or character development momemts, why would there be, the fans already know all there is to know about the characters.  Luckily, the animation is so vivid and fun you can easily be dazzled and enjoy it.  I vaguley remember origins and plotlines from X-Men and Hulk, so I was fine, but those who have never picked up a comic but enjoyed Batman Begins, Iron-man or the Spider-man films may be lost.  I'm shocked the studio allowed this one to be made its so specific, but I like it.  It's ballsy to do something like that.  Hell, it still surprises how Kevin Smith was able make 6 films that were simply for a very specific group of fans and they were all loaded with obscure references and in-jokes.Marvel Animation is hitting its stride and this, so far, is their crowning achievement.  They started getting good with Dr. Strange.  The animation was more alive and the storytelling more interesting.  Ultimate Avengers was pretty good, but the sequel was a little lackluster and boring.  Iron-Man was just dull and the CGI animaton didn't look good with the cell stuff.  Didn't see the Next Avengers, sorry but the idea of it just didn't appeal to me at all.HULK VS. THORThis is the best of the two, and I've never read a Thor comic beyond The Ultimate Avengers.  It had character development and actual drama.  Plus, we are take to the world of Asgard which is alien and obviously Norse influenced.  Thor was more than a brute but a hero with real conflict.  How the Hulk fits into the story is also original and not something I expected.  *MILD SPOILER*  Remember those comic covers with Bruce Banner and The Hulk sharing the image, well this short lets it happen and it's part of the plot.  A real good time.HULK VS. WOLVERINENot as good as the Thor film, but who doesn't love Wolverine?  Wolverine is sublime considering that he is technically one of the weakest of the X-Men as far as powers go(considering Storm can control the weather).  But he is in a long line of American anti-heroes, despite the fact that he is from Canada, sort of.  This short is thin on plot, thinner on character development, but the action is mostly fun and it's laced with humor tracing back to origins that all Fan-Boys, past and current, will recall.  This was is pretty bloody for something rated PG-13, but the money sucking machine in Hollywood would never allow a comic book movie go out the door with an R rating, whether it deserves it or not(Yes, Fan Boys I'm aware of the three Punisher movies, Sin City and others).So check it out.

1208458,A3V5DUZ5KXPGQA,B001KP2J26,Ervin Griffin,"[25, 28]","First, let me say that the Blu-Ray version of this is crisp and clean. Gave me some minor issues loading at first but after I got those cleared up, it was smooth sailing.The features themselves are not very long. I'll talk about them individually:Hulk Vs. Wolverine - This was before his X-Men days as Wolverine was working for Department H. The Hulk invades Canada and Wolverine is sent to hunt him down to stop him or put him down for good. The fight between them is short but pretty violent. Wolvie even makes the Hulk bleed in this one!Not a lot of plot to this adventure but we do get appearances from Wolverine's rogue gallery in the forms of Sabretooth, Lady Deathstrike, Omega Red and (most entertaining of all) Deadpool. Also, these guys explored Wolverine's time with the Weapon X project in a way that none of the animated series' could go (not even the classic '90's series) nor has the movies gone yet. Ending is unresolved but hey, this feature gave us what it should and that's a smash mouth donnybrook!The Hulk Vs. The Mighty Thor - In this one, Loki (the step-brother of Thor) brings The Hulk to Asgard, seperates him from Banner and takes control of him in order to wreak havoc in the Kingdom of Asgard. But his plan backfires and now Thor (as well as Loki and all of Asgard) faces the full fury of a Banner-less, mindless Hulk! While not bloody as Hulk Vs. Wolverine, its no less violent as The Hulk does put a brutal beating at one point on Thor, nearly killing him! This one also has a bit more story to it than the previous feature.There are also several features to this release. The most entertaining, to me, is the behind the scenes of both features as well as a tribute to Jack Kirby as it relates to Thor. There is also footage of Hulk Vs. Wolverine at one of the big Comic conventions.Overall, I was happy with this release. I would not, however, recommend this to small children. This is definitely a feature that should only be viewed by teens and adults. It might be too intense for younger kids. Plus, there is brief language in Hulk Vs. Wolverine during their fight so if you are the kind of person that gets offended easily or is a Bible thumper, this isn't for you.Its a great release overall.",5,The Green Goliath Vs.

1208459,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B001KP2J26,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[1, 1]","HULK VSBeing that I am a fan of Marvel Comics and just about every character that has come out of there you know that I had to have this. In fact I don't know why I have yet to review this up to this point. I remember seeing this on the shelf the day it was released and getting excited because I just knew this would be the best of the latest group of animated films from Marvel. So after calling my bro to come see this with me and since my girl is a fan of basically anything animated we all sat down to watch this. I am very excited to say even though it has been out for a while and you probably know this is an excellent way to spend time in front of the TV. I enjoyed both to the fullest as did the other two in the room with me, I personally think that each one is as good as the other.HULK VS WOLVERINE - this seems to be everybody's favorite right here and I can definitely see why that is, this is a fun and violent little tale. We are right in the middle of Canada it seems and a path of destruction lay right in the heart of it, I think maybe the Hulk had a little to do with that right? Well that is what the government thinks and they have hired everyone's favorite mutant Wolverine or Logan [whatever he wishes to be called I guess] to hunt the Hulk down and stop him in any way possible. So the chase is on but it doesn't take long for them to come face to face and the battle is on. When these two go at it I was really surprised how violent the battle was for a pg-13 film, I sure am glad it is what it is though. Still the biggest plus has to be the fact that Weapon X is not only in this film but stars as well, and Logan's back story is a good yet brief history lesson for those who do not know it [slap yourself].The gang is all here Lady Deathstrike, Sabretooth, Omega Red, and of course the show stealer Deadpool, if for no other reason get this for him he is absolutely hilarious in this. He even sticks to the pointing out that this is a comic [or animation, whatever] like he does in his series. There is not enough I can say about Deadpool in this other then this may have killed it for Ryan Reynolds. This animated version and the guy who did the voice seem like they have built this character up so well in this film that Ryan may not live up to the standards for the Wolverine movie. Still Deadpool may be the best reason to watch this. For the casual viewer this is most likely the one for you, violent, exciting, and funny all wrapped into one. Plus the end shot is completely awesome and stay tuned after the credits for a little more Deadpool.HULK VS THOR- while the Wolverine one may get most of the attention thanks to all the very popular characters and the scene stealing Deadpool the truth of the matter is story wise this may be the better film of the two. For those who don't know Thor is the protector of Asgard especially when his father Odin is resting up, this is the time when all the evil of their planet attacks Asgard. Of course Thor and the Asgard armies are always too much for them that is until Loki the half brother of Thor captures Bruce Banner and uses the Hulk to destroy not only Thor but Asgard as well.The story line here and the way it plays out is extremely well done and really feels like a complete story as were the Wolverine one seemed rushed at times and left you feeling it ended way to soon. Also the animation here is great just like the first one but they are completely different. In the Wolverine one the animation seems more realistic which was fitting due to the story and violent nature of it. But here on the Thor one we are treated to more of a cartoonish feel that helps play to the fact that this is more story oriented than the other.I have to say that of all the animated features to come from Marvel lately this has got to be the best yet. The writing was great in both as was the direction and voice acting for both films, like I said Deadpool in particular. I think the biggest thing to come from this release though is that everyone wants to know when Deadpool will get his own film. If he does get one you better believe I will be buying it, and I won't wait so long to review it either. But enough about that and back onto this, this is an excellent set that seems to be the first in a line of vs films and if they are like this one then they will all be successful. I highly recommend buying this, skip a lame rental.",5,BOTH ARE EXCELLENT,1240963200,"04 29, 2009",2009,4408,"['HULK', 'VSBeing', 'am', 'fan', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'just', 'character', 'come', 'know', 'had', 'have', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'have', 'yet', 'review', 'up', 'point', 'remember', 'seeing', 'shelf', 'day', 'was', 'released', 'getting', 'excited', 'just', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'best', 'latest', 'group', 'animated', 'films', 'Marvel', 'So', 'calling', 'bro', 'come', 'see', 'girl', 'fan', 'basically', 'anything', 'animated', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'am', 'very', 'excited', 'say', 'even', 'been', 'out', 'while', 'probably', 'know', 'excellent', 'way', 'spend', 'time', 'front', 'TV', 'enjoyed', 'fullest', 'did', 'other', 'two', 'room', 'personally', 'think', 'one', 'as', 'good', 'other.HULK', 'VS', 'WOLVERINE', 'be', 'everybody', 'favorite', 'right', 'here', 'can', 'definitely', 'see', 'why', 'fun', 'violent', 'little', 'tale', 'are', 'right', 'middle', 'Canada', 'path', 'destruction', 'lay', 'right', 'heart', 'think', 'maybe', 'Hulk', 'had', 'little', 'do', 'right', 'Well', 'what', 'government', 'thinks', 'have', 'hired', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'mutant', 'Wolverine', 'Logan', '[', 'be', 'called', 'guess', ']', 'hunt', 'Hulk', 'down', 'stop', 'way', 'possible', 'chase', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'come', 'face', 'face', 'battle', 'When', 'two', 'go', 'was', 'really', 'surprised', 'how', 'violent', 'battle', 'was', 'pg-13', 'film', 'sure', 'am', 'glad', 'what', 'Still', 'biggest', 'plus', 'be', 'fact', 'Weapon', 'X', 'not', 'only', 'film', 'stars', 'as', 'well', 'Logan', 'back', 'story', 'good', 'yet', 'brief', 'history', 'lesson', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'know', '[', 'slap', ']', '.The', 'gang', 'here', 'Lady', 'Deathstrike', 'Sabretooth', 'Omega', 'Red', 'course', 'show', 'stealer', 'Deadpool', 'other', 'reason', 'get', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'even', 'pointing', 'out', 'comic', '[', 'animation', ']', 'series', 'not', 'enough', 'can', 'say', 'Deadpool', 'other', 'then', 'may', 'have', 'killed', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'animated', 'version', 'guy', 'who', 'did', 'voice', 'seem', 'have', 'built', 'character', 'up', 'so', 'well', 'film', 'Ryan', 'may', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'standards', 'Wolverine', 'movie', 'Still', 'Deadpool', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'reason', 'watch', 'casual', 'viewer', 'most', 'likely', 'one', 'violent', 'exciting', 'funny', 'wrapped', 'one', 'end', 'shot', 'completely', 'awesome', 'stay', 'tuned', 'credits', 'little', 'more', 'Deadpool.HULK', 'VS', 'THOR-', 'Wolverine', 'one', 'may', 'get', 'most', 'attention', 'thanks', 'very', 'popular', 'characters', 'scene', 'stealing', 'Deadpool', 'truth', 'matter', 'story', 'wise', 'may', 'be', 'better', 'film', 'two', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Thor', 'protector', 'Asgard', 'especially', 'when', 'father', 'Odin', 'resting', 'up', 'time', 'when', 'evil', 'planet', 'attacks', 'Asgard', 'course', 'Thor', 'Asgard', 'armies', 'are', 'always', 'too', 'much', 'Loki', 'half', 'brother', 'Thor', 'captures', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'Hulk', 'destroy', 'not', 'only', 'Thor', 'Asgard', 'well.The', 'story', 'line', 'here', 'way', 'out', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'really', 'feels', 'complete', 'story', 'were', 'Wolverine', 'one', 'seemed', 'rushed', 'times', 'left', 'feeling', 'ended', 'way', 'soon', 'Also', 'animation', 'here', 'great', 'just', 'first', 'one', 'are', 'completely', 'different', 'Wolverine', 'one', 'animation', 'more', 'realistic', 'was', 'fitting', 'due', 'story', 'violent', 'nature', 'here', 'Thor', 'one', 'are', 'treated', 'more', 'cartoonish', 'feel', 'play', 'fact', 'more', 'story', 'oriented', 'other.I', 'have', 'say', 'animated', 'features', 'come', 'Marvel', 'lately', 'got', 'be', 'best', 'yet', 'writing', 'was', 'great', 'was', 'direction', 'voice', 'acting', 'films', 'said', 'Deadpool', 'particular', 'think', 'biggest', 'thing', 'come', 'release', 'though', 'everyone', 'know', 'when', 'Deadpool', 'will', 'get', 'own', 'film', 'get', 'one', 'better', 'believe', 'will', 'be', 'buying', 'wo', ""n't"", 'wait', 'so', 'long', 'review', 'either', 'enough', 'back', 'excellent', 'set', 'be', 'first', 'line', 'vs', 'films', 'are', 'one', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'successful', 'highly', 'recommend', 'buying', 'lame', 'rental']",Hulk Vs.
1208460,A3UHRZG3CS022C,B001KP2J26,"frankbif ""frankbif""","[0, 0]","Earlier reviews went over the storylines and the MARVEL universe in-depth, so I'll just add that as only an occasional frequenter to the MARVEL universe and comic book stuff in general, I liked this Blu-Ray disc.  The interviews with the creators and the behind-the-scenes looks were illuminating; before that, I had just thought the voice actors/actresses read the scripts pretty straightforward.  I didn't realize the effort and time they put into the different voice inflections, the physical effort to voice the characters, etc.The Blu-Ray disc came through very nicely on my 720p plasma TV and Sony 460 BR player.  The menu is a bit confusing as it doesn't appear to resume play if you stop the movie and I never figured out how to use the BOOKMARKS function, assuming it works.  The BR disc takes a bit longer to load but these are minor quibbles.What would have been a great addition for the EXTRAS would have been some of the 1960's cartoon shorts that you see on YouTube and might now be available on DVD's.  I remember the old ""THOR"" cartoons because of the opening jingle.  They should have put some of those on the BR disc, re-digitalized and upconverted to make it look nice.  There have been 2 ""HULK"" cartoons since the 1980's but they've made the rounds on TV and reruns and I think the older fans and the newer ones would have appreciated those 1960's cartoons that came out only a few years after Stan Lee and MARVEL had hit the ground running.The length of the 2 movies is fine, but don't expect much in the way of character development or in-depth personality analysis of the characters.

1208465,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B001KP2J26,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[6, 7]","Hulk, his essence being that of always having a mad on, has had repeated run-ins with several of the other Marvel characters. There's his classic battles with the Thing, but Ben Grimm's not in here so let's put that aside. While I don't really recall the Hulk having much of a rivalry with Thor, Wolverine is another matter. Wolverine made his debut in the Hulk's comic book (issue #181) and these two have had a history since then, most of it not lovey-dovey. HULK VS. WOLVERINE and HULK VS. THOR are companion pieces - two short animated direct-to-dvd films, respectively 37 minutes and 45 minutes long - and are showcases not for intricate plotting and exposition but for meaty, hard-hitting, down-and-dirty fighty fights.So Wolverine is the best there is at what he does, and here what Wolverine does best is get the Canuck pounded out of him. As HULK VS. WOLVERINE takes place, Logan is still a ways away from his stint with the X-Men. Here, he's still under orders from Department H, which sends him to investigate a creature which has crossed into Canada and annihilated a tiny town. And this sets up the first meet between Wolverine and the Hulk, as they face off in the Canadian wilds. The tussle follows its logical course, with the Hulk mostly getting the better licks in. I'd never seen Wolverine go painfully airborne so many times, at the behest of the Hulk's mighty haymakers. But then their fun bag of hurt is interrupted by Logan's old pals from the Weapon X program...There is some serious violence featured in both HULK VS. WOLVERINE and HULK VS. THOR, and both films are most definitely NOT recommended for the young kids. In VS. WOLVERINE, with its free-for-all monster vs. monsters theme (even Logan doesn't come off as so noble) and with just about every character endowed with a healing factor, the storytellers are able to cut loose with the extremely brutal action sequences. Arms get ripped off or sliced off. People get gutted. And Logan calls everyone ""Bub,"" except for Bruce Banner, whom he calls ""Weepy."" But it's cool that ferocious, remorseless fighters like Wolverine and the Hulk aren't restrained to PG-rated patty cake stuff.Happy fun time for Wolverine fans as he's featured heavily in this one, his origins getting a good once over and with particular focus on his involvement with Weapon X. This story is set not too far removed from those days, and so what we get is a Logan who's even more hardcore than he is with the X-Men. Check out the way he induces Banner's transformation into the Hulk.It's pretty neat seeing the other messed-up characters from Weapon X. Lady Deathstrike is as formidable as I remember her, while the merrily insane, scene-stealing Deadpool absolutely brings down the house with his hilarious one-liners. The levity he injects into this very grim movie is most welcome. And, by the way, do yourself a favor and stick around for a brief but funny post-end credits sequence.Segueing now to Norse mythology. Apparently, it's all about Odin the All-Father. Odin's power is what safeguards Asgard, the Realm Eternal and home to the Norse gods. Except that once a winter the All-Father must rest, must spend a cycle of time in Odinsleep. At this time Asgard is at its most vulnerable, a most inauspicious time for its warriors, most especially when a rampaging Hulk shows up. It's all a plan of Loki's, of course, the god of mischief and the Thor-scorned Enchantress working dark enchantments to separate Bruce Banner from his always cheesed off alter ego. This division renders the Hulk at his most mindless and savage, become pure rage incarnate, and he makes short work of the pantheon of Norse gods.Here's one example of these two films working in harmony, balancing each other. While VS. WOLVERINE feels gritty and dark, VS. THOR, even at only 45 minutes, has an epic tone. Gods are featured here, and frost giants, valkyries, the Warriors Three, the enchanted hammer Mjolnir, and the rainbow bridge, so immediately the story feels larger than life, but then factor in too the widescreen scenery and the bright colors. And, above all else, Thor, the god of thunder, who is so noble I feel like I should hate on him on principle. The Hulk goes thru Asgard's protectors as violently and easily as chimichangas go thru my dyspeptic grandmother. And, yes, the Hulk also batters Thor into pancake, in fact punches him thru a mountain. Thor is clearly worried about the Hulk (""This is no immortal evil that we face now. The Hulk has come to Asgard.""). It's pretty intense, seeing the god of thunder being pummeled this badly, and I reiterate what's said in the audio commentary: ""It says something, when a god... is afraid of you.""The resolution, of course, is easy to figure out, but I like that Bruce Banner wants no part of it. While I dig the Hulk, I'm not a fan of Bruce Banner. Note that in these two short films, he doesn't come away in a flattering light, presented as this tormented dude all weepy and sniveling. Anyway, if you've ever enjoyed Jack Kirby and Walt Simonson's takes on Thor and Asgard, then HULK VS. THOR'll put a grin on your mug.This is a two disc package. Disc one has the HULK VS. WOLVERINE short animated film and the following special features: two audio commentaries (one by producer/co-writer Craig Kyle & co-writer Chris Yost, the other by supervising director/producer Frank Paur and storyboard artists Kevin Altieri & story Butch Lukic); ""This Is Gonna Hurt"" - the 20-minute-long Making Of HULK VS. WOLVERINE; Fan Frenzy: 2008 Comic Con - a Q & A panel with cast & crew (8 minutes long); and a first look at the television animated series WOLVERINE & X-MEN.Disc two has the HULK VS. THOR short animated film and the following special features: two audio commentaries (one by Craig Kyle & Chris Yost, the other by Frank Paur, director Sam Lui & colorist James Peters); ""Of Gods And Monsters"" - the 18-minute-long Making Of HULK VS. THOR; Jack Kirby + Thor - various folks talk about artist Jack Kirby's influence on the look and feel of Thor; and a first look at the upcoming THOR: TALES OF ASGARD (about Thor when he was a youth).I actually think that having these short running times was a good thing. HULK VS. WOLVERINE and VS. THOR are more impactful, get their plots rapidly moving, and benefits from a lack of dead spots. The voice acting is really good and the animation is terrific and fitting for each respective film: the rough-and-tumble grit of HULK VS. WOLVERINE, the archaic majesty and might versus might of HULK VS. THOR. In any case, both moods succeed in drawing you in. And, if you're like me, you'll end up in Blissville as the Hulk resentfully smashes about him like the world is one huge Whack-a-Mole, Wolverine unleashes his claws to do some serious damage, and Thor keeps on talking funny.

Tague ""nerd""","[1, 2]","I had a lot of anticipation for this animated feature from Marvel when I first heard about it from the Next Avengers DVD, and it didn't let me down.Hulk vs. Wolverine is almost right out of the classic comic that first introduced everybody's favorite Canadian antihero. The story starts off simple enough, Hulk's on a rampage and it's up to Logan to stop him. Only problem is the Weapon-X program gets involved. This feature is almost more of a Wolverine Origin story, but in the end it's Hulk, Logan, and the Weapon-X program in a massive brawl with every man and woman for themself! The animation is actually more simplistic looking then recent Marvel animated features. It almost looks more like the animated DC universe at times. But this is quickly made up for by the over-the-top action sequences. What's more is The Hulk and Wolverine don't pull their punches at all in this one. They smash, slash, crush, and carve each other up like they mean it, which is long overdue.Hulk vs. Thor is, as the preview from Next Avengers said, more like Hulk vs. Asgard. The big green war machine takes on the land of the Gods while Odin sleeps, and it's up to Thor to stop him. Thor and Hulk have had a number of great fights over the years, and an animated feature dedicated to their rivalry was long overdue. The animation is actually a step up from Hulk vs. Wolverine, though still very stylized. The action is just as good though. Hulk smashes like their no tomorrow, and Thor does what he does best, fight monsters!Both films are great additions to the Marvel Animated collection, and with a new X-men series on the way and an animated Thor special later this year, it looks like we'll have to make more room on the shelves.",4,Another great animated title from Marvel!,1234569600,"02 14, 2009",2009,1722,"['had', 'lot', 'anticipation', 'animated', 'feature', 'Marvel', 'when', 'first', 'heard', 'Next', 'Avengers', 'DVD', 'did', ""n't"", 'let', 'down.Hulk', 'vs.', 'Wolverine', 'almost', 'right', 'classic', 'comic', 'first', 'introduced', 'everybody', 'favorite', 'Canadian', 'antihero', 'story', 'off', 'simple', 'enough', 'Hulk', 'rampage', 'up', 'Logan', 'stop', 'Only', 'problem', 'Weapon-X', 'program', 'involved', 'feature', 'almost', 'more', 'Wolverine', 'Origin', 'story', 'end', 'Hulk', 'Logan', 'Weapon-X', 'program', 'massive', 'brawl', 'man', 'woman', 'themself', 'animation', 'actually', 'more', 'simplistic', 'looking', 'then', 'recent', 'Marvel', 'animated', 'features', 'almost', 'more', 'animated', 'DC', 'universe', 'times', 'quickly', 'made', 'up', 'over-the-top', 'action', 'sequences', 'What', 'more', 'Hulk', 'Wolverine', 'do', ""n't"", 'pull', 'punches', 'one', 'smash', 'slash', 'crush', 'carve', 'other', 'up', 'mean', 'long', 'overdue.Hulk', 'vs.', 'Thor', 'preview', 'Next', 'Avengers', 'said', 'more', 'Hulk', 'vs.', 'Asgard', 'big', 'green', 'war', 'machine', 'land', 'Gods', 'Odin', 'sleeps', 'up', 'Thor', 'stop', 'Thor', 'Hulk', 'have', 'had', 'number', 'great', 'fights', 'years', 'animated', 'feature', 'dedicated', 'rivalry', 'was', 'long', 'overdue', 'animation', 'actually', 'step', 'up', 'Hulk', 'vs.', 'Wolverine', 'still', 'very', 'stylized', 'action', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'Hulk', 'smashes', 'tomorrow', 'Thor', 'what', 'best', 'fight', 'monsters', 'films', 'are', 'great', 'additions', 'Marvel', 'Animated', 'collection', 'new', 'X-men', 'series', 'way', 'animated', 'Thor', 'special', 'later', 'year', ""'ll"", 'have', 'make', 'more', 'room', 'shelves']",Hulk Vs.

It's on par with monsters fighting.I was exicited to finally hear they were making a movie with Hulk fighting Wolverine. While I still enjoyed the film, I was really dissapointed in it. Here's my reviews for both filmsHulk vs. Wolverine- I was exicited to see this film. However, I feel like this film came up really short. First off, it focuses too much on Wolverine's backstory. This is something we didn't need to see since we already know who Wolverine is. Second, it doesn't live to the title. For a film called ""Hulk vs. Wolverine"", it's only a minor scene because they only fight for like a minute or two in an half hour film. they pretty much take a backseat to Deadpool. It be like making King Kong & Godzilla fight in the very beginning of their movie and the rest is having a random monster steal the spotlight from them. Third, too many unnecessary characters. I don't know why they added all this characters from Wolverine's past. I know it's interesting to added a few more, but I feel they just took up space in the movie. Space that could have been used for more of Hulk & Wolverine fights. Most notibly, Deadpool who just chewed the scenes he was in (Yes, I don't give a darn about Deadpool). I feel like the animators forgot that they were making a Hulk vs. Wolverine film and thought they were making a Wolverine vs. Weapon X film with Hulk. It's like they had Hulk & Wolverine fight for two mintues and the rest is just Deadpool with his lame jokes. But all my rants aside, it's still entertaning. Though it was short, the fight with Hulk & Wolverine is fun with lots of slashes & blood. Although I don't care about Deadpool, the voice work by Nolan North is great. Finally the animation is great for this film. Overall, This one was still entertaining but still dissapointing because it doesn't live up to the title.Hulk vs. Thor- This is what I expected to see in Hulk vs. Wolverine. Unlike that movie, Hulk & Thor fight through out the movie with the other characters only being background characters. I'm not a Thor fan however, so I wasn't exicited about this film one bit. Because we've already seen this two fight in Ultimate Avengers. Plus, nobody wants to see Thor fight Hulk as much as they do want to see Hulk fight Wolverine. I don't have much to say about this one, it was decent and it's what you'd expect. Thor fans will love this.Overall, both film are fun and entertaining.

1208470,AY8C0WLCA5GD2,B001KP2J26,Isaac J. Mahoney,"[0, 1]","If you love the Hulk Smash, then this dvd is for you.  Hulk Vs. is a compilation of two animated short films, Hulk vs. Wolverine and Hulk vs. Thor. The first: Hulk vs. Wolverine was created to feature the character of Deadpool and generate hype for the new Wolverine and the X-men TV series, (which is now in its second season and doing rather well).  Hulk vs. Thor introduces audiences to Thor and his world, designed to build up interest in Marvels upcoming Thor live-action film.Hulk vs. Wolverine features Logan's original comic debut, where he's sent by the government to bring down the Hulk.  Our two heroes duke it out for awhile before being captured by Weapon X.  We're introduced to Wolverine's past and his villains,\ (Sabretooth, Lady Deathstrike, Omega Red, and Deadpool).  The script really showcases Deadpool as a comedic highlight; the movie is worth watching for him alone.  Packed with tons of nicely choreographed action and a stunningly well-cast Wolverine, Hulk Vs. Wolverine is an excellent watch for any X-men or Hulk fan.Hulk vs. Thor does a fine job of introducing the realm of Asgard and its heroes.  Loki, the God of Mischief, captures Bruce Banner and sends the rampaging Hulk to kill Thor.  Thor and all of Asgard throw themselves against the Hulk, but it'll take even more than Mijolnir's Hammer to stop this raging green beast.  If you get tired of really repetitive action and a lot of screaming ""RAARGH!"" every time someone gets hit, this movie is not for you.  Some more fight choreography would have done wonders here.  But if you're up for half an hour of Hulk going head to head with Asgard, (it fittingly reminded me of Minas Tirith from Lord of the Rings), then you'll get an eyeful.  Hulk vs. Thor serves its purpose of introducing Thor's characters and his world, but it just gets a little too long and a little too ridiculous.  The ""eye-roll"" moments are rather high here, what with lines like ""but if the mighty Thor fails, what hope is there for Asgard?""  I recommend it for the fact that it sets up Planet Hulk extremely well.",3,"vs. Wolverine = great, vs. Thor = just okay.",1278720000,"07 10, 2010",2010,2071,"['love', 'Hulk', 'Smash', 'then', 'dvd', 'Hulk', 'Vs.', 'compilation', 'two', 'animated', 'short', 'films', 'Hulk', 'vs.', 'Wolverine', 'Hulk', 'vs.', 'Thor', 'first', 'Hulk', 'vs.', 'Wolverine', 'was', 'created', 'feature', 'character', 'Deadpool', 'generate', 'hype', 'new', 'Wolverine', 'X-men', 'TV', 'series', 'now', 'second', 'season', 'doing', 'rather', 'well', 'Hulk', 'Thor', 'introduces', 'audiences', 'Thor', 'world', 'designed', 'build', 'up', 'interest', 'Marvels', 'upcoming', 'Thor', 'live-action', 'film.Hulk', 'vs.', 'Wolverine', 'Logan', 'original', 'comic', 'debut', 'where', 'sent', 'government', 'bring', 'down', 'Hulk', 'two', 'heroes', 'duke', 'out', 'awhile', 'being', 'captured', 'Weapon', 'X', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'Wolverine', 'past', 'villains', '\\', 'Sabretooth', 'Lady', 'Deathstrike', 'Omega', 'Red', 'Deadpool', 'script', 'really', 'Deadpool', 'comedic', 'highlight', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'alone', 'Packed', 'tons', 'nicely', 'choreographed', 'action', 'stunningly', 'well-cast', 'Wolverine', 'Hulk', 'Vs.', 'Wolverine', 'excellent', 'watch', 'X-men', 'Hulk', 'fan.Hulk', 'vs.', 'Thor', 'fine', 'job', 'introducing', 'realm', 'Asgard', 'heroes', 'Loki', 'God', 'Mischief', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'rampaging', 'Hulk', 'kill', 'Thor', 'Thor', 'Asgard', 'throw', 'Hulk', ""'ll"", 'take', 'even', 'more', 'Mijolnir', 'Hammer', 'stop', 'raging', 'green', 'beast', 'get', 'tired', 'really', 'repetitive', 'action', 'lot', 'screaming', 'RAARGH', 'time', 'someone', 'hit', 'movie', 'not', 'more', 'fight', 'choreography', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'wonders', 'here', ""'re"", 'up', 'hour', 'Hulk', 'going', 'head', 'head', 'Asgard', 'fittingly', 'reminded', 'Minas', 'Tirith', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'then', ""'ll"", 'get', 'eyeful', 'Hulk', 'Thor', 'purpose', 'introducing', 'Thor', 'characters', 'world', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'long', 'little', 'too', 'ridiculous', 'eye-roll', 'moments', 'are', 'rather', 'high', 'here', 'what', 'lines', 'mighty', 'Thor', 'what', 'hope', 'there', 'Asgard', 'recommend', 'fact', 'up', 'Planet', 'Hulk', 'extremely', 'well']",Hulk Vs.

After watching Hulk Vs., however, I can say that I'm a fan.Battle #1: HULK vs THOR (and friends)Clearly based on the original Avengers storyline, this is a story of Asgard in danger.  Odin is asleep, and it's up to Thor and his soldiers to protect their land.  His brother Loki, desperate for control, seeks to attack by putting a spell on the Hulk and turning him loose.  The action is tense and exciting.  Watching Hulk tear through Asgard, and beating Thor to a pulp is awesome.  Seeing him palm people by their heads, necks, and legs, throwing them like ragdolls, is hilarious.  Have no fear!  Without ruining the ending, it's safe to say that the story ends up as most Marvel storylines.With this story, I have a problem.  Hulk could not beat Thor.  It's just unreal.  Even the most cursory knowledge of Marvel superheroes would tell someone that.  Thor was literally created by Stan Lee as an answer to the near omnipotence of Hulk.  He's a demigod for goodness sakes!  Overall, however, the storyline for this one is fairly well developed, the action is awesome, and the resolution is near perfection.Battle #2: Hulk vs. Wolverine (and friends)Let's see... a massive free-for-all inside the Weapon X compound where Hulk is the proverbial bull in a China shop headlines the story.  Battling Wolverine is bad enough, but add in Deadpool, Lady Deathstrike, Omega Red, and Sabertooth and you have a serious battle royal.  At one point there is a great flashback to the Weapon X series, and issue #181, that brought us all the most awesome of all X-Men characters: Wolverine.Deadpool's wise-cracking steals every scene, absolutely hilarious.  The story really isn't all that developed; it's just an excuse to have a vicious, bloody battle for 30 minutes.  Not that I'm complaining.With incredible animation, superb story-telling, perfect voiceovers, and just HEAPS of action, this double-header is the quintessential reason why people become comic book fans.

Although it could have been a bit longer both of the stories were compelling and interesting.

This was basically because I was more familiar with Wolverine's back story than I was of Thor.  In any case this Blu-ray gets top marks.

Especially on Hulk vs. Wolverine.+ Interesting (although somewhat predictable) storylines.+ Nice behind the scenes ""making of"" extras.+ Brilliant musical score by Guy Michelmore (he's scored most of the other recent Marvel animated features as well).+ Amazing voice acting cast. Deadpool in particular was brought to life extremely well in this feature.Cons- A bit short, even with 2 stories.- Not as enjoyable if you're not entirely familiar with all the characters in the Marvel Universe.  I had this problem with the Hulk vs. Thor portion of the story.- Somewhat unbelievable that The Hulk can best Thor, who is a god.

As you can imagine, these two confrontations strike very different tones.The action begins with ""Hulk vs. Thor"" and it sets the bar quite high. Odin goes into hibernation every winter to regain his strength for a week, during which time Asgard's enemies attack. Thor (Matthew Wolf, reprising his role from ""Thor: Tales of Asgard"") along with the Einherjar rally to defend Asgard each year.  For accomplished fighters like the Asgardian warriors, they consider the seasonal raids to be a fun exercise, making a mockery of their enemy's efforts.Loki (Graham McTavish) is not happy about this state of affairs and crafts a plan: Using the Enchantress' (Kari Wahlgren) sorcery, he captures Bruce Banner (Bryce Johnson), turns him into the Hulk (Fred Tatasciore), and then extracts Banner's soul.  Without the calming influence of Banner, the Enchantress turns the Hulk into Loki's puppet, making him the ultimate killing machine.  Ignoring Banner's pleas, Loki sends the remote-controlled Hulk into Asgard.The Hulk makes short work of just about everybody, including Thor. When Thor manages to wrest control of the Hulk away from Loki, the Hulk goes berserk and nearly beats Thor to death. He is saved from death's door by the Enchantress, who has a crush on Thor and betrays Loki by explaining his plot.  When Thor confronts Loki about his nefarious plans, he discovers Banner dead, murdered by Loki in a fit of pique. Banner's death in Asgard condemns his soul to Hel, one the nine Asgardian realms.Thor convinces Loki that if they don't reunite Banner's soul with the Hulk he will destroy all of Asgard.  Loki commits his forces to delay the Hulk while he and Thor descend to Hel to retrieve Banner's soul.  But the Queen of Hel, Hela (Janyse Jaud) is in no mood to release any souls from her embrace.This is where ""Hulk vs. Thor"" really does an excellent job of fleshing out Bruce Banner, who is normally just an irritating side character whining about getting angry.  Unlike the other souls tortured in Hell, Banner has finally found peace, living a fantasy life with Betty Ross (Nicole Oliver) and even raising a child. In short, Banner doesn't want to be reunited with the Hulk and it's hard to blame him.Conversely, ""Hulk vs. Wolverine"" is just a bunch of Weapon X characters slicing each other up, with the Hulk occasionally in the middle. There's cigar-chomping, ""bub""-spouting Wolverine (Steven Blum), grim Russian Omega Red (Colni Murdock), the angry Lady Deathstrike (Janyse Jaud), the prickly Sabretooth (Mark Acheson), and joke-machine Deadpool (Nolan North).  Wolverine's out to catch the Hulk and the Weapon X team is out to catch Wolverine at the behest of mad professor Thornton (Tom Kane).Unlike ""Hulk vs. Thor,"" ""Hulk vs. Wolverine"" features a wimpy Banner whom everyone looks down on, including Wolverine.  His only purpose is to be goaded into turning into the Hulk, which ignores a major facet of the Hulk persona.Throughout ""Hulk vs. Wolverine"" are intermittent flashbacks to Wolverine's origin, which is peculiar because it shifts the focus away from the Hulk.  On the plus side, the film lets Wolverine really let loose with his claws, slicing off limbs and stabbing people in great gouts of bloody gore.  Still, the attacks are meaningless - the X factor healing ability of the entire Weapon X team means such wounds are temporary at most. Deadpool is the sole standout if only because he makes light of the absurdity of a top secret facility populated with nobody but killer mutants.As the titular character, only ""Hulk vs. Thor"" gives the big green guy his due.  The first installment is basically ""Wolverine vs. Hulk,"" which is fine if you're a Wolverine fan but if you're a Hulk fan, not so much.

1208491,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B001KP2J26,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[0, 0]","The Marvel animated films from Lion's Gate have been pretty good so far, but Hulk VS is by far the best yet. Instead of just one feature-length flick, Hulk VS is two different animated films that total to be about 80 minutes in length, in which the Hulk takes on two different Marvel icons. Hulk VS Wolverine finds the Hulk rampaging through Canada and getting the attention of a pre-X-Men Wolverine and Department H. Wolverine's bloody battle with the Hulk results in running into Wolvie's old Weapon X cohorts (Sabretooth, Deathstrike, Omega Red, and Deadpool), and then things really get interesting. The second film, Hulk VS Thor, finds Thor's evil brother Loki seeking to take control of the Hulk for his own purposes in destroying Asgard, but naturally, things don't work out too well. While Hulk VS Wolverine is definitely the better of the two, Hulk VS as a whole is a blast that is compelling and fun from start to finish. There's plenty of odes to Marvel mythology peppered throughout the film, and there's great voice work as well. The only drawback of Hulk VS is that the animation may not be everyone's cup of tea, and the film is definitely too violent for younger viewers (who would be better off sticking with Next Avengers), but for the rest of us, Hulk VS is a treat.

Although the characters were not well developed, they were portrayed fairly as very evenly matched. Very violent though, this is not a kids' animation feature. Quite enjoyable and action-packed.My one star rating is for the horribly one sided Hulk vs Thor.Hulk vs Thor, as already mentioned by other reviewers, was obviously made by people with a total dislike for the Thunder God.I love both Thor and the Hulk and have been following their encounters since I was a kid. The record of their fights is slightly inclined to Hulk's favor: lots of draws between the two, with 1 or 2 wins for Thor and 3 or 4 wins for Hulk; or something close to that.Yet in this movie Thor is portrayed as a totally inferior and ineffective adversary against the Hulk.And why is that? Just turn on the commentary feature of the film to hear the makers of the movie ridicule the Thor character (this has been mentioned by at least another reviewer of this movie).I would have been equally disappointed if the Hulk character was the one depicted as badly as Thor was in this movie. As a fan of comics I expect DC, Marvel and the other companies to be aware of the respect they owe to their characters and to us the fans of those characters. In my book that means to portray them fairly and true to their imaginary attributes, qualities and weaknesses. And not to make that portrayal based on biases, personal likes/dislikes and whims of writers, directors or any others responsible for developing the plots or scripts.This charade of a superheroes animation film is an affront to those of us who appreciate and value the fair depiction of the fictional characters whose publications we have cherished for so many years. The mockery of the Mighty Thor that is so evident in the story and so admittedly true in the makers' commentaries is something that Marvel should have not let happened.Again I would have disliked this film just as much if the despising and disrespect had been directed against the Hulk. No superhero character should be disrespected like this.The other aspects of this film are fine: good animation technique, excellent color saturation, great voicing and awesome scenery (the portrayal of Asgard and the Underworld are great).Too bad all of the effort and work for making this animation feature was ruined by turning it into a spite-release valve of the makers against one of the oldest and noblest characters of the Marvel Universe.Hopefully the newly found success of the Mighty Thor in its feature non-animated film and in the mega block buster The Avengers (and hopefully also on Thor The Dark World) will make Marvel aware that they need to be more vigilant to prevent that some buffoons ruin the image (and thus potentially the profitability) of their superheroes.It makes me wish that Thor was for real so he could do some lightning ass-frying to the makers of this dissapointing animated movie.",1,Hulk Vs Spite,1383264000,"11 1, 2013",2013,2936,"['Hulk', 'vs', 'Wolverine', 'was', 'fun', 'watch', 'characters', 'were', 'not', 'well', 'developed', 'were', 'portrayed', 'fairly', 'very', 'evenly', 'matched', 'Very', 'violent', 'though', 'not', 'kids', 'animation', 'feature', 'Quite', 'enjoyable', 'action-packed.My', 'one', 'star', 'rating', 'horribly', 'one', 'sided', 'Hulk', 'vs', 'Thor.Hulk', 'vs', 'Thor', 'already', 'mentioned', 'other', 'reviewers', 'was', 'obviously', 'made', 'people', 'total', 'dislike', 'Thunder', 'God.I', 'love', 'Thor', 'Hulk', 'have', 'been', 'following', 'encounters', 'was', 'kid', 'record', 'fights', 'slightly', 'inclined', 'Hulk', 'favor', 'lots', 'draws', 'two', '1', '2', 'wins', 'Thor', '3', '4', 'wins', 'Hulk', 'something', 'close', 'that.Yet', 'movie', 'Thor', 'portrayed', 'totally', 'inferior', 'ineffective', 'adversary', 'Hulk.And', 'why', 'Just', 'turn', 'commentary', 'feature', 'film', 'hear', 'makers', 'movie', 'Thor', 'character', 'been', 'mentioned', 'least', 'reviewer', 'movie', '.I', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'equally', 'disappointed', 'Hulk', 'character', 'was', 'one', 'depicted', 'as', 'badly', 'Thor', 'was', 'movie', 'fan', 'comics', 'expect', 'DC', 'Marvel', 'other', 'companies', 'be', 'aware', 'respect', 'owe', 'characters', 'fans', 'characters', 'book', 'portray', 'fairly', 'true', 'imaginary', 'attributes', 'qualities', 'weaknesses', 'not', 'make', 'portrayal', 'based', 'biases', 'personal', 'likes/dislikes', 'whims', 'writers', 'directors', 'others', 'responsible', 'developing', 'plots', 'scripts.This', 'charade', 'superheroes', 'animation', 'film', 'affront', 'who', 'appreciate', 'value', 'fair', 'depiction', 'fictional', 'characters', 'publications', 'have', 'cherished', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'mockery', 'Mighty', 'Thor', 'so', 'evident', 'story', 'so', 'admittedly', 'true', 'makers', 'commentaries', 'something', 'Marvel', 'should', 'have', 'not', 'let', 'happened.Again', 'would', 'have', 'disliked', 'film', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'despising', 'disrespect', 'had', 'been', 'directed', 'Hulk', 'superhero', 'character', 'should', 'be', 'disrespected', 'this.The', 'other', 'aspects', 'film', 'are', 'fine', 'good', 'animation', 'technique', 'excellent', 'color', 'saturation', 'great', 'voicing', 'awesome', 'scenery', 'portrayal', 'Asgard', 'Underworld', 'are', 'great', '.Too', 'bad', 'effort', 'work', 'making', 'animation', 'feature', 'was', 'ruined', 'turning', 'spite-release', 'valve', 'makers', 'one', 'oldest', 'noblest', 'characters', 'Marvel', 'Universe.Hopefully', 'newly', 'found', 'success', 'Mighty', 'Thor', 'feature', 'non-animated', 'film', 'mega', 'block', 'buster', 'Avengers', 'hopefully', 'also', 'Thor', 'Dark', 'World', 'will', 'make', 'Marvel', 'aware', 'need', 'be', 'more', 'vigilant', 'prevent', 'buffoons', 'ruin', 'image', 'thus', 'potentially', 'profitability', 'superheroes.It', 'wish', 'Thor', 'was', 'real', 'could', 'do', 'lightning', 'ass-frying', 'makers', 'dissapointing', 'animated', 'movie']",Hulk Vs.

Wind,"[1, 1]","While I enjoyed the previous animated features from Marvel (Ultimate Avengers 1 & 2), I was not overly excited by the animation used in those films. They were a bit cheap-looking, and could have been so much more.Well, it looks like Marvel realized that, and they've stepped it up a bit. Both mini-features in ""Hulk VS"" are well-animated, and pull no punches when it comes to blood, violence, and fine details. Anything with the Hulk and Wolverine in it should be violent, and bloody... and this is. Kids should probably not get to see this one until they're in their teens.The Wolverine film is less Hulk and more Weapon X, but that's a good thing. All characters a represented well in this story. There are lots of background details for fans (Did you see X-23 in there?) and a lot of excitement. Voice work is excellent; Especially for Wolverine and Deadpool. The script is intelligent and not dumbed-down for a kid audience. My only complaints are that they don't give the casual viewer any idea WHEN this occurred in Wolverine's history, and the ending is pretty abrupt (though you should stick around after the credits to see the outcome).The Thor feature was true to the comics, and really followed the Asgardian tales from Marvel quite well... But I've always had a problem with voice casting for Asgardians. Why do they always cast people who do British English (or faux-British) accents to portray the Asgardians? They aren't the gods of the U.K.! They're the NORSE gods, and as such should probably have Norse accents (and yes, I realize they're still speaking English, which is also just nonsensical, but I chalk that up to magic; They're speaking ancient Norse, but are understood by the listener, whatever their language, due to their Asgardian/godly nature).  Seriously-- Why does Loki sound like the British god of Mischief, instead of the Norse god of Mischief? Why does Thor sound like an Englishman who has lived in the United States for 40 years, rather than sounding like a Nordic god?Seriously, Marvel-- This is simple. They are NORSE. They have more in common with the Swedish Chef than the cast of Fawlty Towers. Is that so hard to grasp, that you'd fail at voice casting Every. Single. Time?This is no slight on the actors, who I'm sure did what they were told... But it's about time we got a Thor who sounds like he should, and not like a character from Monty Python & the Holy Grail.That little quibble aside, the Thor story was decent, and had a better resolution than the Wolverine story. The ending was a nice nod to older television endeavors, and the writing was worthy of a Thor comic.Is this worth a purchase? Only if you're an animation superfan, a Marvel superfan, or a Wolverine superfan that needs every little thing made featuring these characters. Otherwise, I think it's entertaining to watch, but not something I'd rush to purchase. It is, after all, two 60-minute features (or less) that are pretty straightforward. There's not much twisting and turning in these plots, and that's fine. It's the nature of a Hulk story to be 70% action, and 30% plot. It's what you want, and expect, with a Hulk story.I'd give it five stars if they had given the Asgardians the right voices. For me, it breaks the suspension of disbelief to hear some Asgardians sounding like Englishmen from upper-class London, and some sounding like women from Los Angeles.

1208506,A73QPH7NGI0DJ,B001KP2J26,Sean Curley,"[1, 1]","Marvel's latest D-T-DVD, a double-feature pitting the Hulk against, respectively, Wolverine and Thor; each is about the length of an animated series two-parter (around 40 minutes apiece), except (particularly in the case of the Wolverine one) much more violent.Generally, I've not found Marvel's D-T-DVD stuff released so far to be that impressive, but these both really worked, in terms of what they set out to do.Starting out, I'd say that the Hulk is really just kind of there in both stories; he's worked into the plot, but in both cases the writers basically hijacked the initial idea (Hulk vs. Wolverine, Hulk vs. Thor) to tell some other story. In Wolverine it's ""finally, we get to do an R-rated version of Weapon X"", and in Thor it's ""finally, we get to cram in absolutely every aspect of the Thor mythos that we have any interest in onto animation"" (which, given that there's both an animated series and a second D-T-DVD which is trailed here, may have been a bit unnecessary, but it's still good).Part I:  Hulk vs. WolverineBasically a big fight scene. Wolverine is called in by Department H to deal with a rampaging Hulk, who has seemingly destroyed an entire town along the US-Canadian border. Wolverine tracks the Hulk down (not really knowing what he is at this point), fights him, and basically fights to a draw (this is the 70s-era version that Wolverine was created to fight), and then are captured by Weapon X (which apparently isn't associated with Department H here). This story is tied into the Wolverine and the X-Men cartoon, so Wolverine, Banner, Sabretooth, and Professor Thornton all have the same voice actors; also here are Lady Deathstrike, Omega Red, and Deadpool. Thornton wants Wolverine back in the program, but Deathstrike and Sabretooth would rather kill him, so they stab Thornton and, well, try to kill him. Big fight, etc. The attraction here is seeing ""claw people"" (as Hulk calls them) stab each other a lot with blood and stuff; Deadpool's quite funny.Part II:  Hulk vs. ThorStarting out, I'll say that fans of Thor who were expecting an epic throwdown between the two will be disappointed here; this might more accurately be titled ""Hulk walks all over Thor, and so Thor has to find some other way of stopping the Hulk"". I personally have never found the uber-godmoder Hulk all that interesting, but it's an established thing, so there you go; getting past that, the story's pretty good, and if you like Thor's world pretty everybody is here.The story takes place during the yearly Odinsleep, when the All-Father rests and all the villains try to conquer Asgard because Odin is absurdly powerful and they've only got a chance when he's not there. Thor and co. beat up all comers, as usual (Thor's getting rather depressed by this endless cycle). Loki and Enchantress capture Bruce Banner, and turn him into the Hulk; Amora then pulls Banner out the Hulk (and Loki kills him), leaving only the incarnate rage (see Hulk #300 in the early 80s), with Loki pulling the strings. However, the rage becomes too much and breaks Loki's control, and Rage-Hulk is loosed and starts destroying everything. He beats up the Warriors Three and Balder, then pummels Thor to death (to Loki's delight), and heads off towards the city; Hela is about to claim Thor's soul, but Enchantress intervenes and brings him back to life, since her whole motivation for helping Loki was she was angry that Thor chose Sif over her. Thor and Enchantress capture Loki, and Thor makes Loki go with him to Hel to reclaim Banner to put him back in the Hulk, and sends Enchantress to help Sif, who's the End Boss guarding Odin. So Thor and Loki journey thither, while Hulk punches his way through like a bajillion random guards, Brunnhilde and the other Valkyries, etc. on his way there.As a tour of the Nine Worlds, it packs quite a lot into 40+ minutes (it's the longer of the two); both of these stories just drop you into an established world, which is refreshingly different from how a lot of these films do things; you pick up all the necessary information as you go along.All in all, it's a good package; less character or plot than big fights, but the short lengths of each piece means that they don't overstay their welcomes.",4,The best of Marvel's animated DVDs to date.,1233014400,"01 27, 2009",2009,4239,"['Marvel', 'latest', 'D-T-DVD', 'double-feature', 'pitting', 'Hulk', 'respectively', 'Wolverine', 'Thor', 'length', 'animated', 'series', 'two-parter', '40', 'minutes', 'apiece', 'particularly', 'case', 'Wolverine', 'one', 'much', 'more', 'violent.Generally', ""'ve"", 'not', 'found', 'Marvel', 'D-T-DVD', 'stuff', 'released', 'so', 'far', 'be', 'impressive', 'really', 'worked', 'terms', 'what', 'set', 'out', 'do.Starting', 'out', ""'d"", 'say', 'Hulk', 'really', 'just', 'kind', 'stories', 'worked', 'plot', 'cases', 'writers', 'basically', 'hijacked', 'initial', 'idea', 'Hulk', 'vs.', 'Wolverine', 'Hulk', 'vs.', 'Thor', 'tell', 'other', 'story', 'Wolverine', 'finally', 'get', 'do', 'R-rated', 'version', 'Weapon', 'X', 'Thor', 'finally', 'get', 'cram', 'absolutely', 'aspect', 'Thor', 'mythos', 'have', 'interest', 'onto', 'animation', 'given', 'animated', 'series', 'second', 'D-T-DVD', 'trailed', 'here', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'unnecessary', 'still', 'good', '.Part', 'Hulk', 'vs.', 'WolverineBasically', 'big', 'fight', 'scene', 'Wolverine', 'called', 'Department', 'H', 'deal', 'rampaging', 'Hulk', 'who', 'seemingly', 'destroyed', 'entire', 'town', 'US-Canadian', 'border', 'Wolverine', 'Hulk', 'down', 'not', 'really', 'knowing', 'what', 'point', 'basically', 'fights', 'draw', '70s-era', 'version', 'Wolverine', 'was', 'created', 'fight', 'then', 'are', 'captured', 'Weapon', 'X', 'apparently', ""n't"", 'associated', 'Department', 'H', 'here', 'story', 'tied', 'Wolverine', 'X-Men', 'cartoon', 'so', 'Wolverine', 'Banner', 'Sabretooth', 'Professor', 'Thornton', 'have', 'same', 'voice', 'actors', 'also', 'here', 'are', 'Lady', 'Deathstrike', 'Omega', 'Red', 'Deadpool', 'Thornton', 'Wolverine', 'back', 'program', 'Deathstrike', 'Sabretooth', 'would', 'rather', 'kill', 'stab', 'Thornton', 'well', 'try', 'kill', 'Big', 'fight', 'etc', 'attraction', 'here', 'seeing', 'claw', 'people', 'Hulk', 'stab', 'other', 'lot', 'blood', 'stuff', 'Deadpool', 'quite', 'funny.Part', 'II', 'Hulk', 'ThorStarting', 'out', ""'ll"", 'say', 'fans', 'Thor', 'who', 'were', 'expecting', 'epic', 'throwdown', 'two', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'here', 'might', 'more', 'accurately', 'be', 'titled', 'Hulk', 'walks', 'Thor', 'so', 'Thor', 'find', 'other', 'way', 'stopping', 'Hulk', 'personally', 'have', 'never', 'found', 'uber-godmoder', 'Hulk', 'interesting', 'established', 'thing', 'so', 'there', 'go', 'getting', 'story', 'pretty', 'good', 'like', 'Thor', 'world', 'pretty', 'everybody', 'here.The', 'story', 'place', 'yearly', 'Odinsleep', 'when', 'All-Father', 'rests', 'villains', 'try', 'conquer', 'Asgard', 'Odin', 'absurdly', 'powerful', ""'ve"", 'only', 'got', 'chance', 'when', 'not', 'there', 'Thor', 'co.', 'beat', 'up', 'comers', 'usual', 'Thor', 'getting', 'rather', 'depressed', 'endless', 'cycle', 'Loki', 'Enchantress', 'capture', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'turn', 'Hulk', 'Amora', 'then', 'Banner', 'Hulk', 'Loki', 'kills', 'leaving', 'only', 'incarnate', 'rage', 'see', 'Hulk', '300', 'early', '80s', 'Loki', 'pulling', 'strings', 'However', 'rage', 'too', 'much', 'Loki', 'control', 'Rage-Hulk', 'loosed', 'destroying', 'everything', 'up', 'Warriors', 'Three', 'Balder', 'then', 'Thor', 'death', 'Loki', 'delight', 'heads', 'city', 'Hela', 'claim', 'Thor', 'soul', 'Enchantress', 'intervenes', 'back', 'life', 'whole', 'motivation', 'helping', 'Loki', 'was', 'was', 'angry', 'Thor', 'chose', 'Sif', 'Thor', 'Enchantress', 'capture', 'Loki', 'Thor', 'Loki', 'go', 'Hel', 'reclaim', 'Banner', 'put', 'back', 'Hulk', 'Enchantress', 'help', 'Sif', 'who', 'End', 'Boss', 'guarding', 'Odin', 'So', 'Thor', 'Loki', 'journey', 'thither', 'Hulk', 'way', 'bajillion', 'random', 'guards', 'Brunnhilde', 'other', 'Valkyries', 'etc', 'way', 'tour', 'Nine', 'Worlds', 'quite', 'lot', '40+', 'minutes', 'longer', 'two', 'stories', 'just', 'drop', 'established', 'world', 'refreshingly', 'different', 'how', 'lot', 'films', 'do', 'things', 'pick', 'up', 'necessary', 'information', 'go', 'along.All', 'good', 'package', 'character', 'plot', 'big', 'fights', 'short', 'lengths', 'piece', 'do', ""n't"", 'overstay', 'welcomes']",Hulk Vs.

1208509,A3AAK33K3BUUTM,B001KP2J26,trashcanman,"[2, 2]","Well, it looks like Marvel has finally hit it's animation groove.  After some solid 90's series, Marvel fell way behind while DC came out with a blitz of top-notch cartoons likeBatman - The Animated SeriesandJustice Leaguethat easily blew away the competition.  Straight to video releases from both comic giant have failed to be extraordinary.  That seems to have changed at least on Marvel's end. The glut of recent animated works that match the quality of blockbusters likeIron Manhas this geek foaming at the mouth.  It seems as though Marvel has finally stopped trying to appease the masses and is giving the fans what they want.  And what we want is quality animation written by comic book writers and produced by genuine comic book geeks.  ""Hulk Vs"" consists of two (around) 40 minute films intended for hardcore fans that packs tons of action, creative direction, top-of-the-line voice acting, flawless representations of classic characters, and doesn't skimp on the violence either.  There are tons of references and homages to classic moments from the comics that are sure to please as well. This is what I want to see when I watch an animated comic book adaptation.  End of story.The two discs in this set are divided one film plus bonus features for each DVD.  First up: Wolverine.  This is far and away the best of the two.  The true title should be ""Wolverine Is A Total Bada$z With The Coolest Villains And Plus He Fights The Hulk"".  Logan is sent in to take down The Hulk dead or alive.  ""Sounds like fun"" is his reply. The first encounter between the two icons is violent, bloody, and just plain sweet.  I'm talking knock-down, drag-out, stab a motherfudger in the heart, leap onto his back using adamantium claws to dig in and stabilize yourself, bashing somebody into the ground and keep on pounding, dislocated joints, blood everywhere, and the whole whammy.  Hard frickin' core.  And that's all before the bad guys show up.  Sabretooth ring a bell?  How about Omega Red?  Cool, right?  add a truly psychotic Lady Deathstrike to that mix.  Oh, and did I mention the animated debut of DEADPOOL, my very favorite character in all of comicdom?!  This guy makes this film for me even more than the awesome action scenes.  He is the Merc with the Mouth and he's exactly as he should be; wise-cracking, gun-blasting, trash-talking, and a$z-kicking.  If you don't laugh at him struggling to piece together his trisected arm (healing factor) while pitched battle rages around him you are a sad, sad person.  This is at least one fanboy's dream come true.  Other moments of note include Hulk's battle with Deathstrike (doesn't end so well for the cyborg assassin; you will wince) and the look on Sabretooth's face when he turns to see an especially angry Hulk bearing down on him full-tilt.5 stars, easy.  And don't skip out on the credits, either.The second disc is not nearly as amazing, but still geektacular and a first in that it takes place entirely in Asgard, home of the gods.  Here, the Allfather Odin sleeps his periodical slumber during which all of the evil hordes of the realm unleash their full might to attempt to take the kingdom while the king of the gods cannot defend it.  That's where our hero comes in, the God of Thunder himself, Thor Odinson.  Having sent the forces of evil packing yet again, the heroes of Asgard prepare for some rest and await Odin's awakening.  But Thor's evil half-brother Loki has one more trick up his sleeve. Combining his own magic with Enchantress's, he is able to bring Bruce Banner to Asgard, separate him from The Hulk, and place Big Green under his direct control. This is not really ""Hulk Vs Thor"" This is ""Hulk Vs. Asgard"".  Thor Odinson, verily thy might fared thee not well against the green behemoth's Fedoresque ground-and-pound.  This is awesome if you're a Hulk fan, and not so much if you are a Thor fan. Come on, the dude's a GOD.  Only cosmic entities should have near the juice to send him to death's door.  But hey, minor complaint.  We all know that these head-to-heads are little more than popularity contests anyways. Soon, Hulk breaks Loki's control and then he is everybody's problem.  Too bad the God of Mischief sent Banner to the underworld.  Now nobody can rein the monster in.  Not Volstagg, nor Fandral, Hogun, and Balder, not Sif and Enchantress put together or Asgard's entire army, not one Frost Giant and not two.  HULK SMASH EVERYONE!  Very cool, but more emphasis on Thor's power would have served the fans much better.4 starsTwo animated comic book movies done right, one great price.  Don't be a dope; if you have any interest in comics whatsoever, buy it.  Special features include outstanding making-of featurettes for both, multiple commentaries for both, a tribute to Jack Kirby's groundbreaking work on the Thor comic, interviews and footage from the Comic-con premier of ""Hulk Vs. Wolverine"", and special looks at an upcoming animated Thor project and""Wolverine and the X-Men"" which having seen the first 3 episodes I can safely say is the most exciting adaptation of the mutant superhero team yet. Every single one of these special features is well worth your time.

I've loved the animated Batman films, so I decided to take a venture into the animated Marvel universe.  Needless to say, I wasn't blown away by this blu-ray.  Let me break it down for you:Hulk Vs. Thor- being a huuuge Thor fan, I feel like this didn't do justice to Asgard.  It tried to bring Simonson's and Kirby's work to life, but the result was too hokey for me.  Thor is best when subtle and powerful, instead of loud and ungraceful.  They nearly got there for me, but its a really tough balance.  The tone would have been better for kids.  I can't complain about the action or the actual Hulk.  The story was well done, and I enjoyed the fanboy nods.  My only dissapointment was that the tone didn't quite align with the story.Hulk Vs. Wolverine- I actually enjoyed this one more, since it attempted to be more badass.  My first of two complaints was that it danced between kiddy and brutal too much.  The curseword-hiding dopey jokes do not match ultraviolence with blood at all.  Secondly, I praised the attempt to adapt Windsor-Smith's origin of Wolverine, but it should have been done separately.  That series is very dark and eerie, and it deserved it's standalone separate adaptation.  Cramming it into this movie didn't quite work for me because it was rushed, and it didn't fit witht the whole of the film.Together these films aren't bad, I just won't be watching them again and again.  They mostly consist of great ideas, with scattered efforts.  To sum it up its all over the place.  The animation company did a mediocre job, really.  They should have gone with the full anime treatment, instead of an overseas company trying to mimic American animation.  There are a couple moments that are shoddy.  Don't worry though, because you will be entertained, but I doubt you will be totally impressed.

Just when it was getting really good, the fight interruption just spoiled the flow things for me. I enjoyed what happened, but there wasn't all that much to it and it wasn't that deep. Deadpool was great though.  After they get back to fighting, there was really no resolution. It's not like you can have Wolverine kill the Hulk or vice versa.

Hulk Vs. is a double feature with two short stories featuring the Hulk goin up against Thor and Wolverine. This DVD is on 37 minute tale of Hulk Vs. Wolverine, the second a 45 minute tale of Hulk Vs Thor. For summaries of the storylines, you can look at many of the other reviews or the product description.In Hulk vs. Thor, Odin, who is God of that place, sleeps every winter and in that time, Asgard comes under attack by the forces of evil. The champion, Thor, always fights them off to the chagrin of his stepbrother Loki, the God of mischief. Loki enacts a plan that he hopes will defeat Thor. That plan is to bring in the Hulk, the strongest creature in Midgard (earth's plane), to destroy Asgard's defenses. Hulk is placed under a spell and Bruce Banner is seperated from him so that he will have no check on his power. Then Loki sends him on a rampage through Asgard.In Hulk vs. Wolverine, Wolverine has been given the task of deafeating the Hulk. Both are then confronted by Weapon X consisting of Sabertooth, Lady Deathstrike, Omega Red and Deadpool. This on has the bloodiest and most brutal violence that I have ever seen in an animated film. Deadpool was hilarious being comic relief and I liked this one better then Hulk vs. Thor.Marvel fans will be pleased to pick up this up. This is something that will mostly appeal to fans of the characters or those looking for some good action. Remember this is rated PG-13. I will not recommend this to be viewed by kids for the violence is brutal and bloody, especially in Hulk vs. Wolverine which had scenes consisting of slashing, slicing off arms with blood gushing out of the wound, soldiers lying dead in a pool of their own blood and sinking claws into flesh. Deadpool even gets his arm sliced off in a scene. I recommend that this should NOT be viewed by kids.The DVD also has some commentary and a few trailers. I would recommend this to any Marvel fan and this could mean that Marvel should continue producing more animated films similar to this one.",5,"Twice the carnage, twice the rampage",1234051200,"02 8, 2009",2009,2075,"['was', 'pleased', 'pick', 'up', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'Marvel', 'Hulk', 'Vs.', 'double', 'feature', 'two', 'short', 'stories', 'featuring', 'Hulk', 'goin', 'up', 'Thor', 'Wolverine', 'DVD', '37', 'minute', 'tale', 'Hulk', 'Vs.', 'Wolverine', 'second', '45', 'minute', 'tale', 'Hulk', 'Vs', 'Thor', 'summaries', 'storylines', 'can', 'look', 'many', 'other', 'reviews', 'product', 'description.In', 'Hulk', 'vs.', 'Thor', 'Odin', 'who', 'God', 'place', 'winter', 'time', 'Asgard', 'attack', 'forces', 'evil', 'champion', 'Thor', 'always', 'fights', 'off', 'chagrin', 'stepbrother', 'Loki', 'God', 'mischief', 'Loki', 'plan', 'will', 'defeat', 'Thor', 'plan', 'bring', 'Hulk', 'strongest', 'creature', 'Midgard', 'earth', 'plane', 'destroy', 'Asgard', 'defenses', 'Hulk', 'placed', 'spell', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'seperated', 'so', 'will', 'have', 'check', 'power', 'Then', 'Loki', 'rampage', 'Asgard.In', 'Hulk', 'vs.', 'Wolverine', 'Wolverine', 'been', 'given', 'task', 'deafeating', 'Hulk', 'are', 'then', 'confronted', 'Weapon', 'X', 'consisting', 'Sabertooth', 'Lady', 'Deathstrike', 'Omega', 'Red', 'Deadpool', 'bloodiest', 'most', 'brutal', 'violence', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'animated', 'film', 'Deadpool', 'was', 'hilarious', 'being', 'comic', 'relief', 'liked', 'one', 'better', 'then', 'Hulk', 'vs.', 'Thor.Marvel', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'pleased', 'pick', 'up', 'up', 'something', 'will', 'mostly', 'appeal', 'fans', 'characters', 'looking', 'good', 'action', 'Remember', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'will', 'not', 'recommend', 'be', 'viewed', 'kids', 'violence', 'brutal', 'bloody', 'especially', 'Hulk', 'vs.', 'Wolverine', 'had', 'scenes', 'consisting', 'slashing', 'slicing', 'off', 'arms', 'blood', 'gushing', 'wound', 'soldiers', 'lying', 'dead', 'pool', 'own', 'blood', 'sinking', 'claws', 'flesh', 'Deadpool', 'even', 'arm', 'sliced', 'off', 'scene', 'recommend', 'should', 'NOT', 'be', 'viewed', 'kids.The', 'DVD', 'also', 'commentary', 'few', 'trailers', 'would', 'recommend', 'Marvel', 'fan', 'could', 'mean', 'Marvel', 'should', 'continue', 'producing', 'more', 'animated', 'films', 'similar', 'one']",Hulk Vs.
1208516,A3HP9JNRHOA5CW,B001KP2J26,William James Taylor IV,"[0, 0]","BEWARE OF SPOILERSPretty straight forward, plot light action fodder stories, one pits a pre-X-Men Wolverine against both the Hulk & the clawed one's particular rogue's gallery (which includes such fan favorites as Deadpool and Sabertooth), the other has a completely savage Banner-less Hulk being used by Loki to attack Thor & Asgard during the Odinsleep (when Odin the All-Father, AKA: Thor & Loki's dad, rests, leaving Asgard more vulnerable to attack).In the end the Wolverine segment is the stronger of the two, much stronger perhaps because screenwriters & frequent partners in crime Craig Kyle & Chris Yost are at heart more X-Men fans - and especially appear to be more Wolverine fans - and appear to be more fans of Hulk than Thor (which makes it strange that ""Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes"" for which Yost was the show-runner a few years later, treated both characters more equally than this pathetic drivel), though one should probably not discount corporate shenanigans (the same shenanigans that resulted in Hulk & Iron Man having big supporting roles in ""Next Avengers"" while Thor got completely vilified as well as being reduced to a cameo). The Wolverine segment gives fans of this extremely overrated character what they expect - a better adaptation of his origin than the god awful 2009 film, as well as very hard hitting action, the kind Wolverine has never been able to have in past animated efforts for obvious reasons. The voice acting all around is very good - Steve Blum is an excellent Wolverine (he even sounds a little bit like Cal Dodd from the 90s series) and Nolan North is absolutely hilarious as Deadpool, the merc with a mouth (how North got miscast as Cyclops on ""Wolverine & the X-Men"" remains a mystery).The Thor segment, however, is nothing puerile garbage designed to be lowest common denominator masturbation for the Hulk fans as Hulk subjects Thor to a laughably humiliating beat down & then proceeds to batter Asgard to its knees, courtesy of Loki's machinations. Good voice actors - Graham McTavish as Loki steals every scene he's in - are wasted on poor writing that fails to invest the audience in the plight of its characters because the characters clearly aren't as important as Hulk's rampage. Not even Bruce Banner getting a glimpse of a peaceful ending resonates the way it should. Where the Wolverine segment featured an eye rollingly laughable shot of Wolverine bringing the equally overrated Hulk to his knees after a few chest slashes, here Thor is reduced to a green rookie who just stands around like an idiot allowing the Hulk to beat the crap out of him, ignoring the centuries of combat experience, just so the Hulk, who's really not even that interesting of a character no matter who's writing him, can look good and Hulk fans can squeal like children while Thor fans are left with nothing. On top of that, the animation in the Thor segment is absolutely hideous - the character designs are ugly and clunky as Hell, with Thor being the ugliest and clunkiest of all (his love interests, steadfast Sif and evil Amora, don't exactly live up to their comic book beauty either), and the designs don't animate well, which makes the already poor quality fight scenes look even more ridiculous. Yeah, the Wolverine segment also features highly stylized designs but they actually work for the more grounded hard edged thriller that they set out to be, while the stylized designs of the Thor segment don't work at all. Thor & his fellow Asgardians would receive far better designs on ""Earth's Mightiest Heroes"" and even in ""Tales of Asgard"" where Thor, Loki, Sif & Amora are mere teenagers.Hulk and Wolverine fans should eat this right up, Thor fans will be disappointed.",3,"Good for Hulk & Wolverine fans, terrible for Thor fans",1379808000,"09 22, 2013",2013,3724,"['BEWARE', 'OF', 'SPOILERSPretty', 'straight', 'forward', 'plot', 'light', 'action', 'fodder', 'stories', 'one', 'pre-X-Men', 'Wolverine', 'Hulk', 'clawed', 'one', 'particular', 'rogue', 'gallery', 'such', 'fan', 'favorites', 'Deadpool', 'Sabertooth', 'other', 'completely', 'savage', 'Banner-less', 'Hulk', 'being', 'used', 'Loki', 'attack', 'Thor', 'Asgard', 'Odinsleep', 'when', 'Odin', 'All-Father', 'AKA', 'Thor', 'Loki', 'dad', 'rests', 'leaving', 'Asgard', 'more', 'vulnerable', 'attack', 'end', 'Wolverine', 'segment', 'stronger', 'two', 'much', 'stronger', 'perhaps', 'screenwriters', 'frequent', 'partners', 'crime', 'Craig', 'Kyle', 'Chris', 'Yost', 'are', 'heart', 'more', 'X-Men', 'fans', 'especially', 'appear', 'be', 'more', 'Wolverine', 'fans', 'appear', 'be', 'more', 'fans', 'Hulk', 'Thor', 'strange', 'Avengers', 'Earth', 'Mightiest', 'Heroes', 'Yost', 'was', 'show-runner', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'treated', 'characters', 'more', 'equally', 'pathetic', 'drivel', 'one', 'should', 'probably', 'not', 'discount', 'corporate', 'shenanigans', 'same', 'shenanigans', 'resulted', 'Hulk', 'Iron', 'Man', 'having', 'big', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Next', 'Avengers', 'Thor', 'got', 'completely', 'vilified', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'reduced', 'cameo', 'Wolverine', 'segment', 'fans', 'extremely', 'overrated', 'character', 'what', 'expect', 'better', 'adaptation', 'origin', 'god', 'awful', '2009', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'very', 'hard', 'hitting', 'action', 'kind', 'Wolverine', 'never', 'been', 'able', 'have', 'past', 'animated', 'efforts', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'voice', 'acting', 'around', 'very', 'good', 'Steve', 'Blum', 'excellent', 'Wolverine', 'even', 'little', 'bit', 'Cal', 'Dodd', '90s', 'series', 'Nolan', 'North', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'Deadpool', 'merc', 'mouth', 'how', 'North', 'got', 'miscast', 'Cyclops', 'Wolverine', 'X-Men', 'mystery', 'Thor', 'segment', 'however', 'nothing', 'puerile', 'garbage', 'designed', 'be', 'lowest', 'common', 'denominator', 'masturbation', 'Hulk', 'fans', 'Hulk', 'Thor', 'laughably', 'humiliating', 'beat', 'down', 'then', 'proceeds', 'batter', 'Asgard', 'knees', 'courtesy', 'Loki', 'machinations', 'Good', 'voice', 'actors', 'Graham', 'McTavish', 'Loki', 'steals', 'scene', 'are', 'wasted', 'poor', 'writing', 'invest', 'audience', 'plight', 'characters', 'characters', 'clearly', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'important', 'Hulk', 'rampage', 'Not', 'even', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'getting', 'glimpse', 'peaceful', 'ending', 'way', 'should', 'Where', 'Wolverine', 'segment', 'featured', 'eye', 'rollingly', 'laughable', 'shot', 'Wolverine', 'bringing', 'equally', 'overrated', 'Hulk', 'knees', 'few', 'chest', 'slashes', 'here', 'Thor', 'reduced', 'green', 'rookie', 'who', 'just', 'around', 'idiot', 'allowing', 'Hulk', 'beat', 'crap', 'ignoring', 'centuries', 'combat', 'experience', 'just', 'Hulk', 'who', 'really', 'not', 'even', 'interesting', 'character', 'matter', 'who', 'writing', 'can', 'look', 'good', 'Hulk', 'fans', 'can', 'squeal', 'children', 'Thor', 'fans', 'are', 'left', 'nothing', 'top', 'animation', 'Thor', 'segment', 'absolutely', 'hideous', 'character', 'designs', 'are', 'ugly', 'clunky', 'Hell', 'Thor', 'being', 'ugliest', 'clunkiest', 'love', 'interests', 'steadfast', 'Sif', 'evil', 'Amora', 'do', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'live', 'up', 'comic', 'book', 'beauty', 'designs', 'do', ""n't"", 'animate', 'well', 'already', 'poor', 'quality', 'fight', 'scenes', 'look', 'even', 'more', 'ridiculous', 'Yeah', 'Wolverine', 'segment', 'also', 'highly', 'stylized', 'designs', 'actually', 'work', 'more', 'grounded', 'hard', 'edged', 'thriller', 'set', 'out', 'be', 'stylized', 'designs', 'Thor', 'segment', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'Thor', 'fellow', 'Asgardians', 'would', 'receive', 'far', 'better', 'designs', 'Earth', 'Mightiest', 'Heroes', 'even', 'Tales', 'Asgard', 'where', 'Thor', 'Loki', 'Sif', 'Amora', 'are', 'mere', 'teenagers.Hulk', 'Wolverine', 'fans', 'should', 'eat', 'right', 'up', 'Thor', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed']",Hulk Vs.

Now, many people complained about the lack of action in Ang Lee's Hulk movie, but these flicks more than make up for that here.  Perhaps a bit too much.  The Wolverine part is very action-driven to the point it feels more like part of a story rather than a complete one.  This DVD was also ill-timed in its release as the short-lived Wolverine and the X-Men cartoon had a Hulk appearance at roughly the same time (although it's not quite as adult in tone).  The Thor story, though, fares a bit better and is a little more well-developed in comparison.  The only major complaint I have there is that Banner is drawn with these insane jowls that just droop.Overall, both segments were entertaining and worth at least a watch.
