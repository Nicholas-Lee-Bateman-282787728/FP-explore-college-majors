It is hard to imagine the beauty of coral reefs in this part of the world, and I was so taken in that it felt like being in a private submarine. The island adventure is captured both above and below the waves in a manner that deserves a second volume.

Papua itself is poorly represented several views of the mushroom islands and the same black cockatoo about 5 times, and what is this ""dancing with the natives"" referred to?

I believe the problem is with his TV and not with the film. Papua 3D was absolutely gorgeous! He was also incorrect about the score, which was above-average, and the comment about seeing the same fish was just ridiculous. I watched it three times to try and find this reappearing fish he/she mentions, all to no avail. Don't believe the three-star review.

Throughout the program, the image is fine for ~5 seconds, then blurs badly for a few seconds.

I don't think it's defective, just poorly produced.The film is also surprisingly boring; it shows the same shots over and over, and a few times when they showed a really attractive fish, they didn't say one word about it!Some of the other reviewers had similar experiences, while others claimed they loved it (could they have been watching a different film?).
