Created and primarily written by author and former police reporter David Simon, the series was broadcast by the premium cable network HBO in the United States. The Wire premiered on June 2, 2002, and ended on March 9, 2008, comprising 60 episodes over five seasons.Each season of The Wire introduces a different facet of the city of Baltimore. In chronological order they are: the illegal drug trade, the seaport system, the city government and bureaucracy, the school system, and the print news media. The large cast consists mainly of character actors who are little known for their other roles. Simon has said that despite its presentation as a crime drama, the show is &#34;really about the American city, and about how we live together. It's about how institutions have an effect on individuals. Whether one is a cop, a longshoreman, a drug dealer, a politician, a judge or a lawyer, all are ultimately compromised and must contend with whatever institution to which they are committed.&#34;",5,"Intelligent police style show. good acting, action and intriguing story line.",1403913600,"06 28, 2014",2014,1179,"['Intelligent', 'police', 'style', 'show', 'good', 'acting', 'action', 'intriguing', 'story', 'line.The', 'Wire', 'American', 'crime', 'drama', 'television', 'series', 'set', 'produced', 'Baltimore', 'Maryland', 'Created', 'primarily', 'written', 'author', 'former', 'police', 'reporter', 'David', 'Simon', 'series', 'was', 'broadcast', 'premium', 'cable', 'network', 'HBO', 'United', 'States', 'Wire', 'premiered', 'June', '2', '2002', 'ended', 'March', '9', '2008', 'comprising', '60', 'episodes', 'five', 'seasons.Each', 'season', 'Wire', 'different', 'facet', 'city', 'Baltimore', 'chronological', 'order', 'are', 'illegal', 'drug', 'trade', 'seaport', 'system', 'city', 'government', 'bureaucracy', 'school', 'system', 'print', 'news', 'media', 'large', 'cast', 'mainly', 'character', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'little', 'known', 'other', 'roles', 'Simon', 'said', 'presentation', 'crime', 'drama', 'show', '34', 'really', 'American', 'city', 'how', 'live', 'together', 'how', 'institutions', 'have', 'effect', 'individuals', 'Whether', 'one', 'cop', 'longshoreman', 'drug', 'dealer', 'politician', 'judge', 'lawyer', 'are', 'ultimately', 'compromised', 'must', 'contend', 'institution', 'are', 'committed.', '34']",The Wire: Season 1

The storylines are very complex, and if you don't understand all, you tend to miss important details.  You must also have some awareness for corruption in the system, and some insight into the operations of the drug world.The drama doesn't solve itself each week, it continues, in other words, the bad guy isn't always caught or neither is the murder of the day solved in 60 minutes, neither are there happy endings at season's end.  Storylines are not cut and dried for the viewer to understand, you must work at each show, work to understand what is going on, as there are many characters in the police force, the justice system, and of course the streets where the drug world plays out.  Actors in The Wire tend to mumble a lot, so it is imperative that you pay close attention, as names and associations are not clearly identified.The first season focuses on the drug gang of the streets of Baltimore, where murders, witnesses, money, corrupt politicians, failed justice system, and drugs are a way of life.

832092,A2YOSGV8YE3NJ8,B0002ERXC2,Adam,"[13, 13]","I have long thought that some of the best stuff on TV can be found among HBO's Original Series.  I'm a big fan of some of HBO's better known dramas including Rome and The Sopranos, as well as of some lighter fare such as The Ali G Show and Curb Your Enthusiasm.  Strangely, I'd barely even heard of The Wire until very recently, when a friend of mine (who generally has very good taste) was raving about it.  Up until then, I hadn't given The Wire a chance, which was a mistake.  At his suggestion, I purchased Season One on DVD.I won't waste much time going into what The Wire is about, as that info can be found elsewhere.  For those who don't know, it's about an under-funded, under-manned, rag-tag group of police officers going after a fairly sophisticated, deep-pocketed, and well connected network of murderous drug dealers in West Baltimore.  While this general theme (underdog cops vs. powerful criminal organization) might not sound all that original, the series is extremely well executed.This is likely not an original opinion, but I think what really sets The Wire apart is its realism.  Granted, I'm an upper middle class nerd who's lived a coddled life, so I may not be the best qualified reviewer to comment on the realism of a show about drug dealers in the West Baltimore projects, but to me it achieves realism in a way that many if not most television (as well as big screen) dramas fail.  It isn't over dramatized.  The cops look and generally act like cops (they don't look like models and they live in crappy apartments, for example).  The ""bad guys"", similarly, look and act like rational participants in ""the game"" would be expected to.  The character development is excellent, and as a viewer I related to (even rooted for) characters on both sides - in fact there are both protagonists and antagonists on both sides.The Series does begin a little bit slow, but this is necessary in my opinion due to its complexity, so be sure not to write it off too early.  I'd guess that, had I been forced to rate The Wire after say, 3 episodes, I would have awarded it about 3 stars.  After 6 episodes, 4 stars.  But around episode 8 or 9 or so, the intensity really builds up and the plot lines start to unfold FAST.  It's well worth the time invested in the first, slower half of the season, in my opinion.I'd consider The Wire one of the best dramas in recent memory, and I'd definitely recommend buying, renting, or borrowing the Season One DVDs.  I would note though that, due to the general complexity of the Series, it's likely you'll want to go back and watch some (or all) episodes more than once, so the DVDs are worth purchasing in my opinion.As for the ultimate endorsement, will I be continuing the Series?  You bet, I'll be ordering Season 2 on Amazon soon after I submit this review.",5,Excellent Dramatic Television,1175126400,"03 29, 2007",2007,2813,"['have', 'long', 'thought', 'best', 'stuff', 'TV', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'HBO', 'Original', 'Series', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'HBO', 'better', 'known', 'dramas', 'including', 'Rome', 'Sopranos', 'as', 'well', 'lighter', 'fare', 'such', 'Ali', 'G', 'Show', 'Curb', 'Your', 'Enthusiasm', 'Strangely', ""'d"", 'barely', 'even', 'heard', 'Wire', 'very', 'recently', 'when', 'friend', 'mine', 'who', 'generally', 'very', 'good', 'taste', 'was', 'raving', 'then', 'had', ""n't"", 'given', 'Wire', 'chance', 'was', 'mistake', 'suggestion', 'purchased', 'Season', 'One', 'DVD.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'waste', 'much', 'time', 'going', 'what', 'Wire', 'about', 'info', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'elsewhere', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'under-funded', 'under-manned', 'rag-tag', 'group', 'police', 'officers', 'going', 'fairly', 'sophisticated', 'deep-pocketed', 'well', 'connected', 'network', 'murderous', 'drug', 'dealers', 'West', 'Baltimore', 'general', 'theme', 'underdog', 'cops', 'vs.', 'powerful', 'criminal', 'organization', 'might', 'not', 'sound', 'original', 'series', 'extremely', 'well', 'executed.This', 'likely', 'not', 'original', 'opinion', 'think', 'what', 'really', 'Wire', 'apart', 'realism', 'Granted', ""'m"", 'upper', 'middle', 'class', 'nerd', 'who', 'lived', 'coddled', 'life', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'best', 'qualified', 'reviewer', 'comment', 'realism', 'show', 'drug', 'dealers', 'West', 'Baltimore', 'projects', 'realism', 'way', 'many', 'not', 'most', 'television', 'as', 'well', 'big', 'screen', 'dramas', 'fail', ""n't"", 'dramatized', 'cops', 'look', 'generally', 'act', 'cops', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'models', 'live', 'crappy', 'apartments', 'example', 'bad', 'guys', 'similarly', 'look', 'act', 'rational', 'participants', 'game', 'would', 'be', 'expected', 'character', 'development', 'excellent', 'viewer', 'related', 'even', 'rooted', 'characters', 'sides', 'fact', 'are', 'protagonists', 'antagonists', 'sides.The', 'Series', 'begin', 'little', 'bit', 'slow', 'necessary', 'opinion', 'due', 'complexity', 'so', 'be', 'sure', 'not', 'write', 'off', 'too', 'early', ""'d"", 'guess', 'had', 'been', 'forced', 'rate', 'Wire', 'say', '3', 'episodes', 'would', 'have', 'awarded', '3', 'stars', '6', 'episodes', '4', 'stars', '8', '9', 'so', 'intensity', 'really', 'up', 'plot', 'lines', 'start', 'unfold', 'FAST', 'well', 'time', 'invested', 'first', 'slower', 'half', 'season', 'opinion.I', ""'d"", 'consider', 'Wire', 'one', 'best', 'dramas', 'recent', 'memory', ""'d"", 'definitely', 'recommend', 'buying', 'renting', 'borrowing', 'Season', 'One', 'DVDs', 'would', 'note', 'due', 'general', 'complexity', 'Series', 'likely', ""'ll"", 'want', 'go', 'back', 'watch', 'more', 'once', 'DVDs', 'are', 'worth', 'purchasing', 'opinion.As', 'ultimate', 'endorsement', 'will', 'be', 'continuing', 'Series', 'bet', ""'ll"", 'be', 'ordering', 'Season', '2', 'Amazon', 'soon', 'submit', 'review']",The Wire: Season 1

832108,A29Y34ALWJUGB5,B0002ERXC2,"Antonio D. Paolucci ""Collector of Entertainment""","[7, 7]","Television today is polluted with cop shows, whether they are reality ones of the same name, or one of the many spin-offs of Law and Order or CSI, only with specific twists that attempt to make the series unique. Problem is, there are at least three spin-offs of each of these series, so uniqueness is obviously no longer there.That's where The Wire comes in. This show has elements of all of the shows above but actually does it with a sense of reality that only HBO can achieve. Cops swear, and drug-dealers talk in slang. These things you just don't here on regular TV because of censorship. Not only that, but HBO has a gift for creating huge casts to cover all aspects of a certain story without bogging down the flow of the story or becoming confusing (see Oz and Deadwood). The story in The Wire follows a group of hastily brought together police officers, detectives, and undercover agents as they attempt to bring down Baltimore's biggest drug kingpin using wire taps and hidden cameras. On the opposite side of this fight, the drug dealers range every where from the simple messenger to the leader himself. Then, there are the inbetweeners, such as the ""Robbin Hood"" who robs from drugs from the dealers and sells it to other dealers to gain favors, the dopers, the kids surrounded by this mess, and the women of the dealers. When brought together, it makes a cast of characters too many to count, but by the end of this season, it's easy to distinguish each and every character.Another great thing about this series is the realism. Anyone who lives in a neighborhood where drugs prevail will feel a pang when watching this show. Cops can be corrupt and cops can be good-guys, while the drug dealers can be the same way, bad or good. What distinguishes them is the choices they made or were forced to make in their pasts, and the side of the law they are on when they break the law. Those who live around this know this well, and will find the realism of The Wire stark indeed.I can't recommend The Wire highly enough. It easily the best cop drama on TV, and if HBO didn't have so many other great shows appearing on DVD and on their channel, I'd say that it may well be the best show on TV. Either way, it's damn close. Get this if you loved The Wire when you first watched it on TV, or if you just want to see something different.

832113,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B0002ERXC2,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[6, 6]","The Wire is, at first glance, Yet Another Cop Show, about a group of disparate and conflicted police officers working to bring down criminals who are often not much better than they are. Yawn. However, there are two things that mean that people should take this seriously. Firstly, it's made by HBO who, up to a couple of years ago anyway, seemed physically incapable of making something unless it was absolutely gripping and awesome. Secondly, it's the creation of former police writer and journalist David Simon, whose previous show was the brilliant Homicide: Life on the Street.The Wire kicks off on the mean streets of Baltimore, Maryland. A murder case against a young black man named D'Angelo Barksdale collapses when one of the witnesses is scared into retracting her testimony. The furious judge learns from homicide detective Jimmy McNulty that D'Angelo is a junior member of a far-reaching criminal gang run by his cousin, the extremely elusive Avon Barksdale. This gang controls all the drug supplies on the west side of the city, and are protected by a labyrinth of legit front organisations. Determined to get some payback, the judge uses his influence to have a special joint homicide-narcotics unit formed to bring down the Barksdale gang, with McNulty assigned and an up-and-coming officer named Lt. Daniels placed in charge.The investigation into the Barksdale organisation by the unit forms the backbone of the first season of the show, but that's just one side of the story. We also get to see the investigation from the POV of the criminals themselves, most notably D'Angelo as he finds himself free but busted down to supplying the lowest of the estates, as well as the kids who work for him. A dangerous, unpredictable third faction is also in play in the form of the one-man army Omar Little, a criminal whose personal code means he can only steal from other criminals. The police try to form an alliance with Omar to bring down Barksdale, but their erstwhile ally has an unfortunate tendency to blow away the criminals they're trying to get locked up, which makes this a difficult task.The appeal of The Wire is hard to explain to those who haven't seen it. It's fairly slow-moving (although never dull) in places and arguably takes two or three episodes to really kick in. It's also pretty unforgiving if you miss an episode. Flashbacks to prior episodes are non-existent, and plot points and character and emotional arcs often turn on a single conversation from several episodes earlier. You need to pay attention here. Luckily, that's made easy by the tight writing, the ingenious methods the criminals go to avoid being caught and the even more intelligent methods the police need to use to investigate them, and the acting. It'd be almost impossible to single out any of the actors for praise. British actor Dominic West has the closest thing to a central role as McNulty, and handles the character very well, but Lance Reddick (more recently seen as the enigmatic Abbadon in Lost) holds every scene he's in as the formidable Lt. Daniels. Clarke Peters develops his character of Lester Freamon from almost a background role to that of the most intelligent and confident officer on the team in a natural and impressive manner. John Doman's constantly-infuriated performance as McNulty's commanding officer and eternal nemesis Major Rawls has to be mentioned as well.On the criminal side of things, British actor Idris Elba (formerly seen as Vaughn in the excellent Ultraviolet) impresses as Stringer Bell, Avon Barksdale's trusted number-two man, and Larry Gilliard Jr. provides the main criminal POV as 'D' Barksdale, as he tries to claw his way back up the organisation amidst growing concerns about how the family does business. For most people - including Barak Obama - the stand-out performances in the show belong to two of the more morally ambiguous characters, namely Michael K. Williams as the dangerously unpredictable Omar and Andre Royo as 'Bubs', a street informant struggling with his own drug addiction. Royo's performance was so convincing that whilst filming he was offered a heroin fix by a passer-by who thought he badly needed it, and later referred to this as his 'street Oscar'.The cast is uniformally brilliant, the writing is fantastic and the show is, surprisingly, very funny. Whether it's the stories of some mind-bogglingly stupid criminals, or the ridiculous difficulties the team faces at getting a desk into their basement office, or Bubs' methods of identifying suspects for the police observers, the show has a jet-black vein of comedy which gives several laughs per episode. This is necessary because the show can be quite bleak, showing as it does wasted young lives amidst the crumbling tenements of a poor city, and a lot of the characters die in rather unpleasant ways over the course of the investigation. The investigation also ends messily, and the fates of many of the characters is left wide open for the second season.The Wire: Season 1 (*****) takes a couple of episodes to build up a head of steam and get you into its headspace, but once that's done it never lets go.",5,Flawlessly enjoyable,1223424000,"10 8, 2008",2008,5143,"['Wire', 'first', 'glance', 'Cop', 'Show', 'group', 'disparate',

I never thought it would be possible to top ""Homicide: Life on the Streets"", but ""The Wire"" has done that in spades in my book. In part it's because David Simon learned a great deal from observing ""Homicide""'s adaptation to television and he's gotten better at his craft (the HBO miniseries ""The Corner"" he wrote after ""Homicide"" is also excellant, and a few actors that later appeared on ""The Wire"" debuted in that series).But beyond that, unlike when ""Homicide"" was on NBC with all of its attendant prime time restraints, ""The Wire"" is an HBO production, which allowed for much more realism (it's ridiculous to depict drug dealers saying nothing harsher than ""fudge"", as is the case on network crime shows) and at the same time, less pressure to 'throw in a steamy love story' or one of those other network conventions.  It does make one wonder how much better ""Homicide"" might've been had it been a HBO series back in the day.It was obvious by the first episode of ""The Wire"" that it had the same great qualities of ""Homicide"", and it was even richer. I thought after the first season of ""The Wire"" that it was inevitable that the second would disappoint, as was the case with ""The Sopranos"" and ""Six Feet Under"" on HBO (two series that have primarily disintergrated into adult soap operas), but amazingly, ""The Wire"" got even better in its second season. Now, with the additional writers Simon has enlisted to help on The Wire's third season (including Dennis LaHane, author of Mystic River), added to the already impressive Richard Price (author of Clockers), it seems likely that the show is just going to get better. Hopefully the Emmys people will finally take notice (though, as David Simon said recently, he already knew from ""Homicide"" that the best way to get ignored in the television world is to film a show in Baltimore).It sounds like the Wire DVDs will have some great extras- which are much appreciated, since the DVDs of David Simon's also excellant ""The Corner"" didn't have any.",5,"BETTER than Homicide, Sopranos, or you name it!",1095120000,"09 14, 2004",2004,2293,"['am', 'not', 'prone', 'exaggeration', 'when', 'talking', 'films', 'television', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'excellant', 'work', 'life', 'television', 'especially', 'improved', 'great', 'deal', 'firmly', 'believe', 'would', 'be', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'make', 'better', 'television', 'series', 'Wire', 'never', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'possible', 'top', 'Homicide', 'Life', 'Streets', 'Wire', 'done', 'spades', 'book', 'part', 'David', 'Simon', 'learned', 'great', 'deal', 'observing', 'Homicide', 'adaptation', 'television', 'gotten', 'better', 'craft', 'HBO', 'miniseries', 'Corner', 'wrote', 'Homicide', 'also', 'excellant', 'few', 'actors', 'later', 'appeared', 'Wire', 'debuted', 'series', 'when', 'Homicide', 'was', 'NBC', 'attendant', 'prime', 'time', 'restraints', 'Wire', 'HBO', 'production', 'allowed', 'much', 'more', 'realism', 'ridiculous', 'depict', 'drug', 'dealers', 'saying', 'nothing', 'harsher', 'fudge', 'case', 'network', 'crime', 'shows', 'same', 'time', 'less', 'pressure', ""'throw"", 'steamy', 'love', 'story', 'one', 'other', 'network', 'conventions', 'make', 'one', 'wonder', 'how', 'much', 'better', 'Homicide', 'might', ""'ve"", 'been', 'had', 'been', 'HBO', 'series', 'back', 'day.It', 'was', 'obvious', 'first', 'episode', 'Wire', 'had', 'same', 'great', 'qualities', 'Homicide', 'was', 'even', 'richer', 'thought', 'first', 'season', 'Wire', 'was', 'inevitable', 'second', 'would', 'disappoint', 'was', 'case', 'Sopranos', 'Six', 'Feet', 'HBO', 'two', 'series', 'have', 'primarily', 'disintergrated', 'adult', 'soap', 'operas', 'amazingly', 'Wire', 'got', 'even', 'better', 'second', 'season', 'Now', 'additional', 'writers', 'Simon', 'enlisted', 'help', 'Wire', 'third', 'season', 'including', 'Dennis', 'LaHane', 'author', 'Mystic', 'River', 'added', 'already', 'impressive', 'Richard', 'Price', 'author', 'Clockers', 'likely', 'show', 'just', 'going', 'get', 'better', 'Hopefully', 'Emmys', 'people', 'will', 'finally', 'take', 'notice', 'though', 'David', 'Simon', 'said', 'recently', 'already', 'knew', 'Homicide', 'best', 'way', 'get', 'ignored', 'television', 'world', 'film', 'show', 'Baltimore', '.It', 'sounds', 'Wire', 'DVDs', 'will', 'have', 'great', 'extras-', 'are', 'much', 'appreciated', 'DVDs', 'David', 'Simon', 'also', 'excellant', 'Corner', 'did', ""n't"", 'have']",The Wire: Season 1

Responses like ""it's boring"" or ""too realistic"" ride under the ""I hate it"" response. If someone says ""I love it"" my affinity for that persons intelligence and personal sense of their place in a diverse and yet mostly unknowable world grows exponentially. ""I hate it"" pegs their life-outlook in the CSI, Law & Order et al mode. Quintessentially myopic in just about every sense of the word. ""I haven't seen it"" immediately brings out the Santa Claus in me as I hand them over my copy for them to ingest, digest, and ultimately get back to me with a measured response. If they come back with the ""I hated it"" they're probably not worth my time. On the other hand, I just got my wife to finally watch the show; she hates those ""f***, f***, f*** n' f***"" shows (as she likes to call them), it took her five episodes to begin to understand what this new beast was. We watched, I saw the light of reality start to dawn on her on just what this was... nothing short of Dostoyevsky's ""Crime and Punishment"", a bit of Hugo's ""Les Miserables"", Dicken's ""Oliver"" - all of which are stunning comments on not only crime, but poverty, and the role that the everyday citizen who turns a blind eye and does not demand accountability from it public service officials plays in the further decline of our society.Now, I love shows like Rome, I can enjoy the happy romp of BBC's Jekyll, Babylon 5, although sorely lacking in most departments, tells a mythic story, The Sopranos was devious tv that was just damn fun to watch, Six Feet Under showcased that comedy could come from anywhere, but The Wire is something altogether different.

At best it would end up being a secret santa present or a rotating loan between friends and family. The Wire is different and actually worth the investment.

The beauty of the show lies in the careful character development and the attention to detail. There are no extra characters who appear in one episode never to be seen again - even the seemingly least important background character will come up again later in the season and again in subsequent seasons. More importantly there are no filler episodes in the season - each one is important to the plot of the season, the overall plot of the series and to the development of major and minor characters.I wouldn't consider myself a tv junkie or a dedicated fan of crime dramas like Law & Order, but this series is simply too good to miss out on.

In fact, why would anyone listen to me when almost 92% of the hundreds who have reviewed this series give it five stars?  Well, just my opinion but here it is:What was expected was that when I started this series, beginning with season one, I was in for a spectacular viewing.  A detective drama set in Baltimore that mixed undercover work, court drama and various themes of humanity.  Does it have it?  Well, sometimes, but the delivery is done with ground shipping, and like the po-boys they try to show in the projects, I end up sitting around on a couch waiting...waiting......waiting for drama that never comes.  Waiting for action that is weak, and waiting to strain through the bog of endless office talk.  Perhaps it is in the office where the show falters the most, sometimes having camera shots zoom in on a person for three seconds at a time while they are thinking about nothing.  Then there is the whole thing with the detective using a typewriter.  Okay, did I miss something?  Is this 2008 or 1978 people??  High Profile crime unit using typewriters, sure I buy it and a bag of that counterfeit money they had in the first episode.I read where someone said the Wire was the Shield ""With brains"", well the intellect may be there but the likeable characters sure are not.  Not in twenty years have I seen a show that has such a weak character development.  The minor details they do try to add to give them some kind of personality, are ultimately just for nothing.  The bad guys are not bad, mean, or scary and the good guys are just plain boring.  Up that with a bunch more office talk where various stiffs wearing suits stand in dark corners trying to act like imposing forces.  Again, nothing there, these characters could be loafs of bread with bright red twisty ties and they would garner more attention.I'm so glad I just rented this season, I was planning on buying season 2 if I liked the first one, but this has to be one of the worst television dramas HBO has EVER done.  One other thing that adds to the NO ORIGINALTIY section of their accolades from me is the fact they seem to think it is necessary to drop 400 F-bombs every show.  For those of you who don't understand that, it means the F-word, and this show has them throwing it around like its DEADWOOD.  Then again, that show got cancelled after only three seasons.

It unravells itself in a way some have compared to a novel, each episode being like a chapter, and this is litterally unlike anything I have ever seen from a television series, and it's just a joy to watch. It covers the investigation in such a detailed, muliviewed way that I felt if I was a part of the community. There aren't cliffhangers or satisfying hollywood conclusions at the end of most episodes, but I was eagarly awaiting every next episode because I was drawn into the story and characters and needed to see what will happen next. The cast from top to bottom is outstanding (no major stars, just character actors), and I won't bother trying to pick a few favorite performances as that would just be too difficult.The Wire is brutally honest in dealing with it's material, which may be a reason it hasn't gotten the recognition it deserves from the likes of the Emmys. People in law enforcement are human, and some are corrupted, while others bend the rules a little bit here and there when it's convienent. The police are not all these rightous crusaders like many television shows depict; in the end it's a job like anything else. It's not a bash on law enforcement at all though; in fact there are great moments of redeption for a few characters. On the criminal side it deals with shades of grey, some being just bad and others victims of their circumstance, but none are thrown under the train as being completey inhuman. The big enemy on the show seems to not be the cops, and not even the criminals, but the beauracracy and the highers ups with political motives that impedes justice.If you've never seen the show do yourself a favor and get this first season.

832163,A1FF2KROA1D87,B0002ERXC2,Denise P,"[5, 5]","One of the best series on TV. Runs at least neck and neck, I think better then the Sopranos.The characters are fascinating and complex. Some of the best story telling and acting I've seen in a long time. The characters personalities are compelling and captivating. You just get hooked.I was a Soprano's snob. I just felt it was the best thing on TV and safely tucked away in Jersey so I didn't have to think about the crimes affecting my life.Before I viewed The Wire, I guess I didn't want to be bothered with the whole urban crime thing, especially so close to home. I felt like what on earth could these kids, with pants hanging down to there knees and rap music blasting have to say that's intelligent?I found that the crime hierarchy is so much like the Sopranos, organized to the point of being genius. I found just like the Sopranos there is a Family like element, but a brutality that is unbelievable.There are characters you will love but know they are paid to kill. Characters you find ultimately ruthless almost with animal cunning. Then you will find some characters eloquent in there lifestyle and speech.Among the characters in Season One, a young dealer who lives in a condemned building with about 6 little elementary school kids. He buys food for them and sends them off to school. He's lost with no parents like those kids. The show isn't preachy in any way. It just is.Also The Wire is about both sides of the coin. The police officers, politics, and lifestyles are just as riveting. Cops that drink too much, have an awful family life, fighting with ex's, or not giving a damn.It's outstanding.......I think it's not as popular as the Sopranos because there aren't a lot of big time stars in it although there are local actors and cameos by some well known artists.Please take a look at this outstanding series; you'll be glad you did.",5,The Wire First Season is outstanding  just like 2 and 3,1173312000,"03 8, 2007",2007,1855,"['One', 'best', 'series', 'TV', 'least', 'neck', 'neck', 'think', 'better', 'then', 'Sopranos.The', 'characters', 'are', 'fascinating', 'complex', 'best', 'story', 'telling', 'acting', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'characters', 'personalities', 'are', 'compelling', 'captivating', 'just', 'get', 'hooked.I', 'was', 'Soprano', 'snob', 'just', 'felt', 'was', 'best', 'thing', 'TV', 'safely', 'tucked', 'away', 'Jersey', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'think', 'crimes', 'affecting', 'life.Before', 'viewed', 'Wire', 'guess', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'bothered', 'whole', 'urban', 'crime', 'thing', 'especially', 'so', 'close', 'home', 'felt', 'what', 'earth', 'could', 'kids', 'pants', 'hanging', 'down', 'there', 'knees', 'rap', 'music', 'blasting', 'have', 'say', 'intelligent', 'found', 'crime', 'hierarchy', 'so', 'much', 'Sopranos', 'organized', 'point', 'being', 'genius', 'found', 'just', 'Sopranos', 'Family', 'element', 'brutality', 'unbelievable.There', 'are', 'characters', 'will', 'love', 'know', 'are', 'paid', 'kill', 'Characters', 'find', 'ultimately', 'ruthless', 'almost', 'animal', 'cunning', 'Then', 'will', 'find', 'characters', 'eloquent', 'lifestyle', 'speech.Among', 'characters', 'Season', 'One', 'young', 'dealer', 'who', 'condemned', 'building', '6', 'little', 'elementary', 'school', 'kids', 'food', 'off', 'school', 'lost', 'parents', 'kids', 'show', ""n't"", 'preachy', 'way', 'just', 'is.Also', 'Wire', 'sides', 'coin', 'police', 'officers', 'politics', 'lifestyles', 'are', 'just', 'riveting', 'Cops', 'drink', 'too', 'much', 'have', 'awful', 'family', 'life', 'fighting', 'ex', 'not', 'giving', 'damn.It', 'outstanding', 'think', 'not', 'as', 'popular', 'Sopranos', 'are', ""n't"", 'lot', 'big', 'time', 'stars', 'are', 'local', 'actors', 'cameos', 'well', 'known', 'artists.Please', 'take', 'look', 'outstanding', 'series', ""'ll"", 'be', 'glad', 'did']",The Wire: Season 1

Both sides have to deal with similar challenges: managing a big group of people that sometimes back-stab each other, adjusting to new technologies, and deciding how to spread the blame around when things go wrong.  I found it interesting that the cartel's juvenile &#34;hoppers&#34; acting as lookouts, touts, runners, and entry-level &#34;product&#34; handlers were forbidden to get high because it would make them unreliable. . . so in a way, the cartel was keeping at least some kids off drugs!Cinematography, acting, dialogue and plot are all top-notch.  None of the &#34;dope fiends&#34; are the least bit chic or enviable, and it was clear that the dealers had zero respect for their customers.  Some of the cops' immediate bosses are the type that could make their employees eager to get out on the street and be shot at, just to get out of the office.  At the top police administrative levels, it's &#34;Dilbert&#34; with guns; any work that gets done is in spite of them rather than because of them.

Terhune ""Ed T.""","[10, 10]","Hard for me to top some of the more laudatory comments already made about this program set on the hard, seedy streets of Baltimore, but I feel as if I should try in this particular instance, as I seldom, and I do mean very seldom, have anything positive to say about the current state of TV, and that includes Cable-TV. Invariably, it panders to the lowest common denominator, it celebrates puerility and all that is execrable about humanity, and it unalterably infects our cultural atmosphere like some pestilential miasmic cloud of banality. This superb dramatic series, a singular exception to that nearly-uniform and depressing rule, is almost enough to restore my faith in the integrity and power of the creative process. I've never been a cop or a criminal, but I can't imagine any dramatic representation more realistic, or gritter, than this. There's no facile moralizing, no craven simplifications, no easy solutions offered, no stalwart cardboard saints pitted against stereotyped dark-hearted sinners. The ""hero"" of this show is a self-destructive, alcoholic detective, portrayed by the talented Dominic West. The ""villain"" is Russell ""Stringer"" Bell, a quietly-charismatic, cold-blooded drug-lord portrayed by the equally-talented Idris Elba. While Bell can certainly and unambiguously be classified as ""evil"", Elba is able to invest the character with a nuanced, complex humanity that, if anything, makes him even more terrifying than he might otherwise seem. As for the other roles, there isn't a bad actor in the ensemble, and the idiomatic dialogue is reminiscent of the better novels by George V. Higgins. Those involved in the creation of this show, to their great credit, assume that their audience is comprised of intelligent, thoughtful adults, and proceed accordingly. The result is a masterful TV-series that will surely restore the faith of those like myself who have become jaded and refuse to believe that anything significant or worthwhile can be produced in our contemporary culture...that includes movies, books, and music, much less TV.

Kutinsky ""ekutinsky""","[3, 3]","If you're like me, you never caught The Wire on HBO in any of its original, low-rated airings, and you heard - through critics, friends, in passing - that it was something akin to the Great Dramatic Series no one had seen, but you never quite wanted to get yourself hooked.  Well, I held out for years, and when I finally got to watching The Wire's critically acclaimed first series, I still had no idea what to expect - a bonus, perhaps, of the low ratings: even its best secrets remain hidden.  Like The Sopranos before it, The Wire creates such a rich web of characters and subcharacters, respects so thoroughly its creation of place and environment, that it takes no time to become absorbed in each brilliant, bristling detail - the show comes roaring in with ""The Target,"" and by episode 2, ""The Detail,"" we're already so entrenched in the reality of events, when a full-scale police-incited riot breaks out, it feels like the most natural, long-time-coming event that could have happened.  The Wire bristles with personality, by every character involved - Dominic West's drunk, egotistical, brilliant McNulty that leads his crew of detectives - the magnificent, moral Greggs (Sonja Sohn), the stalwart Lester (Clarke Peters) - is interesting enough, but he's the least interesting character considering the astonishing crop of personalities and performances that play out amidst the beaurocratic and street-led turmoil of the Baltimore streets - The Wire stands as such an accomplishment because its drug world is as vivid and corrupt as its police world.  In that, the personalities on the street - chilly, calm Stringer Bell (Idris Elba), confused D'Angelo (Larry Gilliard Jr.), smart, innocent Wallace (Michael B. Jordan) - become as absorbing as the world they inhabit.  Each unexpected, nuanced plotline flies in the face of ordinary - or even recognizable - TV convention and lets the conflicting humanity of these personalities jut up against their world, and simply lets us be mesmerized by their results.  I'm thinking of the plot thread that follows Bubbles, the heroin-addicted snitch played fearlessly by Andre Royo, who, in one astonishing scene at an NA meeting in ""One Arrest"" shows, with a mere flicker of his eye, his buried desire to live.  Where the season follows him from there is an indicator of everything this series does right - creates and fulfills the humanity buried in every corner of a dying city.",5,Completely extraordinary,1184889600,"07 20, 2007",2007,2433,"[""'re"", 'never', 'caught', 'Wire', 'HBO', 'original', 'low-rated', 'airings', 'heard', 'critics', 'friends', 'passing', 'was', 'something', 'akin', 'Great', 'Dramatic', 'Series', 'one', 'had', 'seen', 'never', 'quite', 'wanted', 'get', 'hooked', 'Well', 'held', 'out', 'years', 'when', 'finally', 'got', 'watching', 'Wire', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'first', 'series', 'still', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'expect', 'bonus', 'perhaps', 'low', 'ratings', 'even', 'best', 'secrets', 'remain', 'hidden', 'Sopranos', 'Wire', 'creates', 'such', 'rich', 'web', 'characters', 'subcharacters', 'respects', 'so', 'thoroughly', 'creation', 'place', 'environment', 'time', 'become', 'absorbed', 'brilliant', 'bristling', 'detail', 'show', 'roaring', 'Target', 'episode', '2', 'Detail', ""'re"", 'already', 'so', 'entrenched', 'reality', 'events', 'when', 'full-scale', 'police-incited', 'riot', 'breaks', 'out', 'most', 'natural', 'long-time-coming', 'event', 'could', 'have', 'happened', 'Wire', 'bristles', 'personality', 'character', 'involved', 'Dominic', 'West', 'drunk', 'egotistical', 'brilliant', 'McNulty', 'crew', 'detectives', 'magnificent', 'moral', 'Greggs', 'Sonja', 'Sohn', 'stalwart', 'Lester', 'Clarke', 'Peters', 'interesting', 'enough', 'least', 'interesting', 'character', 'considering', 'astonishing', 'crop', 'personalities', 'performances', 'play', 'out', 'beaurocratic', 'street-led', 'turmoil', 'Baltimore', 'streets', 'Wire', 'such', 'accomplishment', 'drug', 'world', 'vivid', 'corrupt', 'police', 'world', 'personalities', 'street', 'chilly', 'calm', 'Stringer', 'Bell', 'Idris', 'Elba', 'confused', ""D'Angelo"", 'Larry', 'Gilliard', 'Jr.', 'smart', 'innocent', 'Wallace', 'Michael', 'B.', 'Jordan', 'become', 'absorbing', 'world', 'inhabit', 'unexpected', 'nuanced', 'plotline', 'flies', 'face', 'ordinary', 'even', 'recognizable', 'TV', 'convention', 'conflicting', 'humanity', 'personalities', 'jut', 'up', 'world', 'simply', 'be', 'mesmerized', 'results', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'plot', 'thread', 'Bubbles', 'heroin-addicted', 'snitch', 'played', 'fearlessly', 'Andre', 'Royo', 'who', 'one', 'astonishing', 'scene', 'NA', 'meeting', 'One', 'Arrest', 'mere', 'flicker', 'eye', 'buried', 'desire', 'live', 'Where', 'season', 'indicator', 'everything', 'series', 'right', 'creates', 'humanity', 'buried', 'corner', 'dying', 'city']",The Wire: Season 1

America's endemic racism can be seen in the white power structures that created and perpetuates social inequality, injustice, spiritual and economic poverty; and what goes on in these Projects is a pernicious capitalism that cheapens life, undermines human values, and deepens the schism between Americans divided by race and capital. The well written scripts of The Wire have lines that are unforgettable and often sum up American values.

It does the impossible, making you care about the criminals and putting the law in an often unflattering light, exposing infighting, career move climbing, backstabbing and corruption by those enforcing the law as much as those breaking it.  Everyone is revealed in the myriad complexity that humanity is.

Dialogue is a bit forced at times and sometimes has that 'scripted' feel.  It doesn't take long though for the show to find it's groove and total absorption to ensue - will certainly be the case by mid-season and definitely by the end.  Fortunately there are 4 more seasons after this each better than the next *though people argue about season 5.  Don't worry - you're in for a riveting ride, and more lost sleep than you might think possible.  Careful about starting this on a night (or week) where you have to get up the next day.  The dangerous thing about the DVD set is that you CAN go on to the next episode without needing to wait a week.  You can go on.. and on.. and on.I have to admit, McNulty was never my favorite character, and one of the reasons I feel later seasons are better than Season 1 (still great in its own right, no mistake) is that his dominance recedes season by season so that he's hardly even in Season 4.

After a conversation with a judge, Det. James McNulty has been assigned to lead a joint homicide and narcotics team, in order to bring down drug kingpin Avon Barksdale. Avon Barksdale, accompanied by his right-hand man Stringer Bell, enforcer Wee-Bey and many lieutenants (including his own nephew, D'Angelo Barksdale), has to deal with law enforcement, informants in his own camp and around town, and competition with a local rival, Omar, who's been robbing Barksdale's dealers and reselling the drugs. The supervisor of the investigation, Lt. Cedric Daniels, has to deal with his own problems, such as a corrupt bureaucracy, some of his detectives beating suspects, hard-headed but determined Det. McNulty, and a blackmailing deputy. The show depicts the lives of every part of the drug ""food chain"", from junkies to dealers, and from die hard cops who are all about heir work, corrupt cops and brownnose higher ranking officials to clean and dirty politicians that lead to a very deep and compelling tale of the corruption, life and more then all, the truth in the city,  David Simon (who has been the main force in a few other great series' set in Baltimore The corner, and tv drama Homicide) brings this great tale to life and this may be the best series I've ever seen on TV!!!!!

And oddly, some of the most realistic television ever made is being made right now.  I once read that you can bring a group of conservatives, liberals, and libertarians together and they will all love The Wire, because they will all find something in it to confirm their worldview.  I'm sure this is true.  It's not because David Simon and Ed Burns made any effort to present a balanced view.  Quite the opposite: they presented an unflinchingly honest view.  So of course people draw from this what they draw from the real world.Many have said that The Wire is the greatest TV show ever produced.  I can't attest to that, but I will say that it is the greatest TV show I have ever watched.  And a very peculiar sort of TV show it is, appropriately described as ""novel-esque.""  Individual episodes rarely come with their own climax, viewers are expected to watch each episode and recall events from the beginning of the season at the end, and the cast of characters is sprawling.I have watched the entire five season run of The Wire, and it is a delight to see each characters beginnings again: the path for some is obvious, others veer sharply from the direction they were headed, and others are not as they appear.  And none are anywhere near where they will end up.  They multiply like cockroaches, but the main characters for season 1 are: Jimmy McNulty, the brilliant homicide detective with a disastrous personal life; Cedric Daniels, a straight-laced police lieutenant with a shady past and a bright future in the force; Kima Greggs, an openly gay and calmly competent narcotics detective; Bubbles, a loquacious heroin addict and reformer; and D'Angelo Barksdale, a mid-level drug dealer who beats a murder rap in episode 1 and is the nephew of the target for season 1.Each season of The Wire has a broad theme and focus (the entire series is thematically about institutional failure), and Season 1 focuses on street drug dealers through the prism of the effort to catch drug kingpin Avon Barksdale and the self-destruction of homicide detective Jimmy McNulty.I think the hype that you can't miss an episode and that it takes a while to get into is overblown.  I missed an episode on my initial watch of each season and maintained a pretty good hold on what was going on.  I was also hooked from watching the last half hour of an episode on HBO while on a business trip, postponing drinks with my coworkers to finish what I thought was some masterful gangster movie that had somehow escaped my notice.  That being said, this is not a show to put on in the background while wandering in and out of the living room.  It does demand your attention.The Wire is notoriously hard to follow, but the producers do what they can to help on the DVD.  Selecting an episode opens another menu with options to watch the ""previously on,"" to watch the ""next on,"" to select a scene, and provides an introductory synopsis for the episode.Simon and the other commentators provide a lot of great context and insight on the DVD commentary, but it can also get overbearing.  To a certain extent, particularly when Simon gets into his personal views, it can become ""sausage making.""  Only the first, second, and penultimate episode of the season have commentary.  Please be forewarned that spoilers abound, including spoilers for the second season.",5,A Novel (and a Great One) in DVD Form Told Over 13 Hours,1314835200,"09 1, 2011",2011,3448,"['Perversely', 'Americans', 'flee', 'reality', 'television', 'escape', 'reality', 'entering', 'world', 'surreal', 'not', 'real', 'oddly', 'most', 'realistic', 'television', 'ever', 'made', 'being', 'made', 'right', 'now', 'once', 'read', 'can', 'bring', 'group', 'conservatives', 'liberals', 'together', 'will', 'love', 'Wire', 'will', 'find', 'something', 'confirm', 'worldview', ""'m"", 'sure', 'true', 'not', 'David', 'Simon', 'Ed', 'Burns', 'made', 'effort', 'present', 'balanced', 'view', 'opposite', 'presented', 'unflinchingly', 'honest', 'view', 'course', 'people', 'draw', 'what', 'draw', 'real', 'world.Many', 'have', 'said', 'Wire', 'greatest', 'TV', 'show', 'ever', 'produced', 'ca', ""n't"", 'attest', 'will', 'say', 'greatest', 'TV', 'show', 'have', 'ever', 'watched', 'very', 'peculiar', 'sort', 'TV', 'show', 'appropriately', 'described', 'novel-esque', 'Individual', 'rarely', 'come', 'own', 'climax', 'viewers', 'are', 'expected', 'watch', 'episode', 'recall', 'events', 'beginning', 'season', 'end', 'cast', 'characters', 'sprawling.I', 'have', 'watched', 'entire', 'five', 'season', 'run', 'Wire', 'delight', 'see', 'characters', 'beginnings', 'again', 'path', 'obvious', 'others', 'veer', 'sharply', 'direction', 'were', 'headed', 'others', 'are', 'not', 'appear', 'none', 'are', 'anywhere', 'where', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'multiply', 'cockroaches', 'main', 'characters', 'season', '1', 'are', 'Jimmy', 'McNulty', 'brilliant', 'homicide', 'detective', 'disastrous', 'personal', 'life', 'Cedric', 'Daniels', 'straight-laced', 'police', 'lieutenant', 'shady', 'past', 'bright', 'future', 'force', 'Kima', 'Greggs', 'openly', 'gay', 'calmly', 'competent', 'narcotics', 'detective', 'Bubbles', 'loquacious', 'heroin', 'addict', 'reformer', ""D'Angelo"", 'Barksdale', 'mid-level', 'drug', 'dealer', 'who', 'murder', 'rap', 'episode', '1', 'nephew', 'target', 'season', '1.Each', 'season', 'Wire', 'broad', 'theme', 'focus', 'entire', 'series', 'thematically', 'institutional', 'failure', 'Season', '1', 'focuses', 'street', 'drug', 'dealers', 'prism', 'effort', 'catch', 'drug', 'kingpin', 'Avon', 'Barksdale', 'self-destruction', 'homicide', 'detective', 'Jimmy', 'McNulty.I', 'think', 'hype', 'ca', ""n't"", 'miss', 'episode', 'while', 'get', 'overblown', 'missed', 'episode', 'initial', 'watch', 'season', 'maintained', 'pretty', 'good', 'hold', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'was', 'also', 'hooked', 'watching', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'episode', 'HBO', 'business', 'trip', 'postponing', 'drinks', 'coworkers', 'finish', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'masterful', 'gangster', 'movie', 'had', 'somehow', 'escaped', 'notice', 'being', 'said', 'not', 'show', 'put', 'background', 'wandering', 'living', 'room', 'demand', 'attention.The', 'Wire', 'notoriously', 'hard', 'follow', 'producers', 'do', 'what', 'can', 'help', 'DVD', 'Selecting', 'episode', 'menu', 'options', 'watch', 'previously', 'watch', 'next', 'select', 'scene', 'introductory', 'synopsis', 'episode.Simon', 'other', 'commentators', 'provide', 'lot', 'great', 'context', 'insight', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'can', 'also', 'get', 'overbearing', 'certain', 'extent', 'particularly', 'when', 'Simon', 'personal', 'views', 'can', 'become', 'sausage', 'making', 'Only', 'first', 'second', 'penultimate', 'episode', 'season', 'have', 'commentary', 'Please', 'be', 'forewarned', 'spoilers', 'abound', 'including', 'spoilers', 'second', 'season']",The Wire: Season 1

I never heard of The Wire until I had discovered other series on DVD, mainly Deadwood and Boardwalk Empire. So I encountered this 2002 crime series only 10 years later. I had heard that it is considered by some to be the best ever. That is quite possibly true.In 2002, the FBI had a new job description, defined by 9-11, and was not interested in drug gangs.The Baltimore police, under pressure from the judiciary after a witness murder,  sets up a special unit, half heartedly, to investigate a mystery man related to drug distribution and murders. The unit consists of some dead weight guys and some outsiders, but it grows into the job. There is more than just drugs and killing witnesses or rivals. There is a vast real estate scam and political corruption, extending into the police force. We are following both sides, the cops as well as the gangs in their business processes.The series has 13 episodes. It focuses on this one big case, the job of unravelling the gang. The work is based on electronic surveillance, hence the series title. The cast consists of  unknown professional actors, no stars. The script stays away from cheap effects.

832208,A17RG4CS9EYYUS,B0002ERXC2,"hydrophilic ""hydrophilic""","[9, 9]","Since there are tons of reviews here singing the praises of 'The Wire', I wanted to aim my review at the people out there who are on the fence about whether to check out this criminally under-rated show.I watched the first episode of 'The Wire' when it first aired, and decided that I didn't like it. To me, it looked like an unfortunate combination of ""Lost"", ""Sopranos"" and ""Oz"". ""Lost"", because as the viewer, you know the characters are never going to succeed, either in getting off the island or getting Baltimore off drugs. I figured there would be a pattern of episodes where the police gain some traction in the drug war, and then the drug dealers would rally, and then the police would come back, et cetera, ad nauseum. ""Sopranos"", because I assumed there would be many bacchanalian scenes where the evildoers revel in their unlimited access to wealth, power, and women. ""Oz"", because it looked relentlessly bleak and violent. I'm not knocking any of those shows, it just seemed to me like 'The Wire' was taking the worst parts of all three.I reluctantly tried the series again because my friends kept raving about it. And here I am, five years later, to say the hype is true. 'The Wire' may well be the best television ever.'The Wire' is first and foremost, a superbly crafted story. As others have said, the season is really one long narrative with thirteen separate chapters. This frees up the television medium considerably. Episodes are not themed, do not uniformly end with shocking twists, and don't adhere to any formula of ""primary plotline interspersed with two minor plotlines."" The acting is brilliant, the dialog is razor-sharp, and view of corruption and poverty is unflinching.Before seeing this show, I have always said that ""Homicide (Life on the Street)"" was the best television series ever made. 'The Wire' includes many of the same elements, but the format - long story arcs and no censorship - take it much further than Homicide ever went.HBO has also shown an admirable restraint in the depiction of violence. 'The Wire' is a violent show, but most of it takes place off-screen, and some of the most memorable scenes are almost finished before you notice them. In one scene, a dealer stops at a shady-looking convenience store for a late night snack, and literally everything in the store, including the owner, is protected by a bullet-proof sheet of glass. In another scene, children from the projects leave for school with a small bag of chips for lunch. The lucky ones also get a juice box.I don't know if this show is qualitatively better than the Sopranos, but personally, I enjoy the Wire more. I would say the Wire is less ambitious in scope, but what it does, it does better. Unlike 'Sopranos' 'The Wire' is plot-driven, which means the characters must serve the story. However, character-driven or not, I got tired of being inside Tony Soprano's head after a few years. Tony is after all a banal, violent man. This may be a realistic depiction of a mafioso, but it does begin to wear. 'The Wire' performs that miraculous trick of depicting boredom, pettiness and venality with actually being boring, petty or venal. People and places are ever so slightly larger than life. It's gritty enough to keep it real, while fantastical enough to keep you enthralled.Finally, the series had the guts to do what almost no other show does: end. The final episode in the season actually brings everything to an incredibly satisfying (though not necessarily neat) conclusion.I hope I've brought at least one more viewer on board to this truly excellent series. A few last notes:- Buy or rent the DVDs. You are going to be lost without subtitles.- Be aware that the dialogue includes an incredible amount of profanity. If that offends you, you will hate this series, all the pros notwithstanding.- As others have warned, the DVD menus contain spoilers. Be careful not to read the plot summaries at the start of every episode. You can't skip them, so just close your eyes and keep pressing ""play."" Also be aware that some of the commentary contains spoilers for following seasons.- A lot of people have said that the good guys aren't so good and the bad guys aren't so bad. This is true. However, don't be fooled into thinking that the show is simple moral relativism. A corrupt cop may beat up a suspect; a high level drug dealer might commit a murder. The show is about many things, primarily about individuals versus the institutions they serve. It also makes a lot of interesting statements about the nature of information - what the cops can glean from the criminals, what the criminals figure out about the cops, what the cops hide from each other. To paraphrase the series tag line, everyone is listening carefully.- On top of everything else, this show is funny!",5,For the doubters out there,1217203200,"07 28, 2008",2008,4794,"['are', 'tons',

I was worried it couldn't live up to the hype, it does.Important things to remember, it's not structured like a normal show. Most TV shows will have a sub plot that runs every episode, this doesn't. It's set up like a book, things aren't going to be 100 percent clear in the beginning. But it will all come together. If it doesn't, you didn't pay attention and this is a show you NEED to pay attention to.This show will not hold your hand through most scenes. If something big happens, it won't alert you to it with music, or a close up or a character telling you that this is important. It expects you to realize what's going on.Most of these actors I don't know, so to me it is really easy to believe that they are not actors but these are the actual lives of these people. It's meant to feel like a documentary, and it truly does feel like one.There were very few moments that wowed me or made me feel extreme emotions, but yet, every time an episode ended, I had to know what was going to happen. Even when I finished the season and everything wraps up, I had to start the second one right away and see what happens next.I recommend this show to any and everyone, above the age of 18.

On the surface, the first few episodes seemed like your typical run of the mill police show, but soon enough i truly started caring for the characters on my screen.  The show is exceptionally well-written with a complex storyline and every episode is packed with so much drama its almost as if every episode has been adapted from a novel.I enjoy that the story isn't simply told from the police officer's point of view, but also The Barksdale Crew, who are the drug dealing gang that supplies crack and heroin throughout their Baltimore projects.I highly reccomend this series to anyone who enjoys really well-written television dramas.

Even though this show didnt win tons of awards like The Sopranos it is in my opinion a more rewarding viewing experience than The Sopranos.  This show is not for those who are impatient and have short attention spans or want instant gratification...if you are then you won't last the first few episodes of season 1.  The beauty of The Wire is that it grows and evolves so by the time you reach the final season things fall into place in such a masterful way that it is time well spent.

I'm Kind Of A ...","[4, 5]","Unlike the Amzon.com editorial review I don't think the wire hooks you after the first episode, actually I think it's like that with both the first and second season. The beginning episodes actually may turn some people off of it but you have to keep watching. Everybody starts out swearing way too much, I mean they can't go three regular words without swearing and your trying to figure out why the cast looks so dumb and why you can barely understand them. You have to push yourself through the first couple episodes to get to the real quality episodes and that's when you're hooked. Not only the cast does a great job but also the writers did a great job of basically knowing Baltimore in and out. They have the slang, the accents, the attitudes, and the gritty drug and political wars right on point. I've been to Baltimore myself but I have never seen the other side of it and that's where it all goes down.The Wire shows the intelligence of Baltimore crime and the fearlessness of all the little soldiers doing the top dogs dirty work on the good guys side and bad guys side. The acting is real and it is so good that they make you believe that they're the characters they're playing. You sure won't find a love story in the wire because everybody wants money, respect, and respect. The story is great because you don't truly know who's good and who's bad like Stringer Bell played by Idris Elba who is the right hand man of Avon Barksdale, Barksdale is basically running Baltimore's drug dealing and all the crime possible. In reality Avon would have been caught if it wasn't for Stringer who is a genius, he goes to school for business and takes all the dirty money and makes it untraceable by buying all the property he can. The funny thing though is that none of the property is in either Avon or Stringer's name so if they ever get caught nobody can touch it.In a way you could say that Stringer is a street savior because he's buying up property and making it black owned but the process of getting the money to do it is killing the young and old people in the community. Stringer is one of my favorite characters but my absolute favorite is Omar played by Michael Kenneth Williams. Now I have to admit he is a little hard to get used to especially when you find about his not so well kept secret, Ok I'll give you a hint, he went to jail and got out liking not having a girlfriend. Omar is also sort of like a street savior because he's one of the worst types of stick up kids you could ever run into. He robs the drug dealers and he takes everything possible. Plus Omar is the cat that gives that extra gun slinging action to the series because he fears no one and even crazier everybody fears him. The wire is a very addictive series and so I suggest watching it on a weekend and if the first few episodes turn you off a little please don't stop watching.",5,How Deep Can It Get,1160524800,"10 11, 2006",2006,2871,"['Amzon.com', 'editorial', 'review', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'wire', 'hooks', 'first', 'episode', 'actually', 'think', 'first', 'second', 'season', 'beginning', 'episodes', 'actually', 'may', 'turn', 'people', 'have', 'keep', 'watching', 'Everybody', 'out', 'swearing', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'mean', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'three', 'regular', 'words', 'swearing', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'cast', 'so', 'dumb', 'why', 'can', 'barely', 'understand', 'have', 'push', 'first', 'couple', 'episodes', 'get', 'real', 'quality', 'episodes', 'when', ""'re"", 'hooked', 'Not', 'only', 'cast', 'great', 'job', 'also', 'writers', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'basically', 'knowing', 'Baltimore', 'have', 'slang', 'accents', 'attitudes', 'gritty', 'drug', 'political', 'wars', 'right', 'point', ""'ve"", 'been', 'Baltimore', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'other', 'side', 'where', 'down.The', 'Wire', 'intelligence', 'Baltimore', 'crime', 'fearlessness', 'little', 'soldiers', 'doing', 'top', 'dogs', 'dirty', 'work', 'good', 'guys', 'side', 'bad', 'guys', 'side', 'acting', 'real', 'so', 'good', 'make', 'believe', ""'re"", 'characters', ""'re"", 'playing', 'sure', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'love', 'story', 'wire', 'everybody', 'money', 'respect', 'respect', 'story', 'great', 'do', ""n't"", 'truly', 'know', 'who', 'good', 'who', 'bad', 'Stringer', 'Bell', 'played', 'Idris', 'Elba', 'who', 'right', 'hand', 'man', 'Avon', 'Barksdale', 'Barksdale', 'basically', 'running', 'Baltimore', 'drug', 'dealing', 'crime', 'possible', 'reality', 'Avon', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'caught', 'was', ""n't"", 'Stringer', 'who', 'genius', 'school', 'business', 'dirty', 'money', 'untraceable', 'buying', 'property', 'can', 'funny', 'thing', 'though', 'none', 'property', 'Avon', 'Stringer', 'name', 'so', 'ever', 'get', 'caught', 'nobody', 'can', 'touch', 'it.In', 'way', 'could', 'say', 'Stringer', 'street', 'savior', 'buying', 'up', 'property', 'making', 'black', 'owned', 'process', 'getting', 'money', 'do', 'killing', 'young', 'old', 'people', 'community', 'Stringer', 'one', 'favorite', 'characters', 'absolute', 'favorite', 'Omar', 'played', 'Michael', 'Kenneth', 'Williams', 'Now', 'have', 'admit', 'little', 'hard', 'get', 'used', 'especially', 'when', 'find', 'not', 'so', 'well', 'kept', 'secret', 'Ok', ""'ll"", 'give', 'hint', 'went', 'jail', 'got', 'out', 'liking', 'not', 'having', 'girlfriend', 'Omar', 'also', 'sort', 'street', 'savior', 'one', 'worst', 'types', 'stick', 'up', 'kids', 'could', 'ever', 'run', 'drug', 'dealers', 'everything', 'possible', 'Omar', 'cat', 'extra', 'gun', 'slinging', 'action', 'series', 'one', 'even', 'crazier', 'everybody', 'wire', 'very', 'addictive', 'series', 'so', 'suggest', 'watching', 'weekend', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'turn', 'off', 'little', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'stop', 'watching']",The Wire: Season 1

Just like a great novel, ""The Wire""'s plot and characterizations unfold gradually (13 episodes) and in great detail, with a more satisfying ending than can be achieved by telling a whole story in just one hour. My only complaint is that the resolution is rushed. They should have taken two episodes to present everything in the last one. It almost ceratainly is the first cop show to give equal time to the bad guys. Both cops and bad guys on ""The Wire"" commit deplorable and heroic acts. Much like Tony Soprano, Baltimore drug lord Avon Barksdale is at times an admirable businessman. Particularly early on he shows a knack for inspiring loyalty and confidence in his employees in a way that would make organizational psychologists proud. It sure doesn't stay pretty all the time, though. Episode 12's climax, the potential inside job hit on a young employee, may be the most gut-wrenching and terrifying moment in television's history. The dialogue on ""The Wire"" is sharp, poignant, hilarious and always authentic. Most of the acting is terrific.

And Sonja Sohn as Greggs, the gay, compassionate, tough undercover cop is equally up to the task, talking the talk and walking the walk.It lacks the breathlessness of 24 in the sense that each episode does not leave you gasping. On the other hand, there's an aspect of 24 that's incredible. You can believe that characters 'would' act that way given the circumstances. It's just that the circumstances seem unrealistic. Not so with ""The Wire."" You're right in there in a Pelecanos or Lehane novel - two of the writers on ""The Wire"" by the way, overhearing the street talk and feeling the heat.

Witness a police detective that allows nothing to interfere with his single-minded pursuit of justice. Like a doberman with a juicy bone, McNulty is dogged and relentless. He circumvents the chain of departmental command, annoys fellow officers, treats partners poorly, breaks the rules, and refuses to compromise. He's arrogant, self-righteous, a binge drinker, an adulterer, a drunk driver, and a general all-around jerk.But if he's on the case, you'd better believe it's going down.

What with the preponderance of characters, the street-smart 'ear' of the dialogue and the lack of typical 'get-up-to-speed' moments, I had to watch this with the subtitles on just so I could keep up.After what some may perceive as a slow first episode, this series sweeps you away with its slew of characters and storylines. Its realism prevents the series from ever taking the easy way out, and with its focus on both the drug-dealing end as well as the narcotics squad end, we learn that no one side has it easy and both come up against opposing forces from within. The cops are ruled by a political hierarchy and judicial red-tape; the drug-dealers are ruled by opposing dealers, CI snitches and the constant need to reshuffle their operations to stay ahead of the police.Perhaps the most appealing feature of this show is that there's no 'shocks' in the 'Sopranos' or 'Shield' nature of the word. There's hardly any violence, and all of the 'action' comes from the incendiary dialogue between the characters. There's a lot of bad language and drug abuse, but certainly nothing gratuitous.What must be remembered is that it takes a few episodes to really get into.

I can't really add to what others have said here, except to say that this is definitely a series to watch.  It's got everything you'd want from a crime drama like CSI, but much more.  The characters are interesting: nobody fits an easy stereotype, and no one is simply a good guy or a bad guy.  There are several overlapping story arcs, but they all fit together in a complex puzzle.  There are hints of many much larger storylines that could be followed up on, but aren't -- it has the feel of a world, the world of Baltimore, unfolding on its own, and we happen to be given a glimpse of some of the interconnected lives of a few investigators  and the ones they are investigating.  But their lives are set against a backdrop of politicians, lawyers, a changing climate in America after 9/11, and much more.I'd heard so many good things about this series but never had a chance to see it -- now that I've seen season one and am halfway through season two, I am hooked and will be watching through to the end.  There's something about television done right that enables an experience you can't get from film -- stories that begin and end and of other stories that pick up where they leave off; a real sense of character growth that doesn't feel artificial, contrived to fit into a 2 hour window; also the feeling for continuity in character and places, of something unfolding over time.  This is television done right, and it is rare and exciting to see it.

Judges turn coat because it is election time, money goes missing, burnt out cops get wire tap equipment from the 1950s, computers are like gold and the body bags are mounting up. If you are not drinking then you are on the take. If you are on the take then the guilt of it runs home fast. Baltimore is falling apart and the worst thing about the drug war is that this label is all wrong... wars are something you can win.The show revolves around Det. Jimmy McNulty, good police who does things behind the backs of his superiors, gets dumped with a bad detail and slowly turns into it a career making case that threatens to rock everyone from the street dealer to Capitol Hill. Within the space of 13 episodes you watch how broken cops build a reliable unit out of nothing and they work the streets to build a case against a residential area's top hoods. This is great drama through and through.The Wire's got a lot of heart for telling it like it is and this is one of the reasons why this little known show often hits the top 10 best TV shows in the reviews. If it wasn't for the reviewers who know a good TV series when they see one, we wouldn't have a clue this was out there.  Who would have thought that a little unknown knocking around could be a contender? If you like good TV then chances are that you will eventually want to try a few episodes and who knows, you might get the wire bug.Pros:- Like the real deal- Solid police story, good balance of views- TV drama for menCons:- Only 13 episodes- Sometimes its low production values are apparent- Catering for male viewers and is not really viewing material for a couple.-  You might expect too much with the hype.",4,Law enforcement drama with a real edge,1223078400,"10 4, 2008",2008,2098,"['Reality', 'bites', 'one', 'protagonists', 'mothers', 'asks', 'final', 'episode', 'season', 'what', 'right', 'Baltimore', 'narcotic', 'investigation', 'unit', 'hard', 'say', 'Nearly', 'everyone', 'little', 'dirt', 'Most', 'bad', 'guys', 'were', 'just', 'born', 'doing', 'what', 'do', 'way', 'out', 'take', 'bullet', 'stretch', 'inside', 'Narcos', 'bust', 'headlines', 'make', 'rank', 'Dealers', 'are', 'game', 'have', 'other', 'way', 'Judges', 'turn', 'coat', 'election', 'time', 'money', 'missing', 'out', 'cops', 'get', 'wire', 'tap', 'equipment', '1950s', 'computers', 'are', 'gold', 'body', 'bags', 'are', 'mounting', 'up', 'are', 'not', 'drinking', 'then', 'are', 'take', 'are', 'take', 'then', 'guilt', 'home', 'fast', 'Baltimore', 'falling', 'apart', 'worst', 'thing', 'drug', 'war', 'label', 'wrong', 'wars', 'are', 'something', 'can', 'win.The', 'show', 'around', 'Det', 'Jimmy', 'McNulty', 'good', 'police', 'who', 'things', 'backs', 'superiors', 'dumped', 'bad', 'detail', 'slowly', 'career', 'making', 'case', 'rock', 'everyone', 'street', 'dealer', 'Capitol', 'Hill', 'space', '13', 'episodes', 'watch', 'how', 'broken', 'build', 'reliable', 'unit', 'nothing', 'work', 'streets', 'build', 'case', 'residential', 'area', 'top', 'hoods', 'great', 'drama', 'through.The', 'Wire', 'got', 'lot', 'heart', 'telling', 'one', 'reasons', 'why', 'little', 'known', 'show', 'often', 'top', '10', 'best', 'TV', 'shows', 'reviews', 'was', ""n't"", 'reviewers', 'who', 'know', 'good', 'TV', 'series', 'when', 'see', 'one', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'clue', 'was', 'there', 'Who', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'little', 'unknown', 'knocking', 'around', 'could', 'be', 'contender', 'like', 'good', 'TV', 'then', 'chances', 'are', 'will', 'eventually', 'want', 'try', 'few', 'episodes', 'who', 'might', 'get', 'wire', 'bug.Pros', 'real', 'deal-', 'Solid', 'police', 'story', 'good', 'balance', 'views-', 'TV', 'drama', 'menCons', 'Only', '13', 'episodes-', 'Sometimes', 'low', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'apparent-', 'Catering', 'male', 'viewers', 'not', 'really', 'viewing', 'material', 'couple.-', 'might', 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'hype']",The Wire: Season 1

HBO's ""The Wire"" is not nearly as breakneck as ""The Shield,"" but it is wholly engaging in a very different way.""The Wire"" draws you in slowly, putting the story together piece by piece as a detail of Baltimore police come together to target a West Baltimore dope dealer who has been operating under the radar. When one of the dealer's lieutenants beats a murder rap in court by intimidating witnesses, Det. Jimmy McNulty ends up griping to the case's judge about it. The judge complains to the higher-ups in the police department, and pretty soon everyone in the Baltimore PO-leece (as they pronounce it) is mad at McNulty for sticking his nose where it doesn't belong.On top of that, when the detail expands its focus to follow not just the drugs, but the money, the case's tentacles start to reach into some high places...What I enjoyed most was the way the show detailed the various workings of a wiretap operation. As one character puts it in the second season, to a detective who feels there isn't enough action on this case, ""We're putting people in jail using wiretaps and typewriters.""The show also takes a frank look at the West Baltimore drug trade -- ""In this town, what other crime is there?"" one detective asks -- from the higher-ups down to the street-level teenage dealers.The focus in particular on the young crews that actually slang dope was interesting. One storyline, which examines the way a baby slanger feels in the aftermath of having been responsible for the torture and death of a neighborhood rip-n-runner (a stick-up man who robs drug dealers) at the hands of his crew, is a pretty powerful tale.The show is chock full of memorable characters, from the suits who run McNulty's homicide unit who are pretty much totally concerned with the unit's clearance rate, to (I believe) Wendell Davis' portrayal of the hilarious and drunken Det. Bunk Moreland, McNulty's partner (there's one scene in which Moreland and McNulty, surprised at what they find in their recreation of a crime scene, use only the 'f' word for about five minutes.... hilarious), to Omar, a -- no joke -- homosexual rip-n-runner, who robs people with a shotgun, gets many of the series' funniest lines and somehow manages to inject some tenderness into a very icy character.The ending doesn't have the slam-bang excitement that a lot of other season finales do, but then again, it's probably more indicative of the way cases like this really do end: you don't nail everyone, and a lot of people walk away unhappy.It's very realistic, and still consistently very entertaining... a hard balance to strike, but HBO and creator David Simon have done it.",4,"Not quite ""The Shield,"" but engaging in a different way",1146528000,"05 2, 2006",2006,2728,"['Shield', 'now', 'gold-standard', 'cop', 'drama', 'Relentless', 'fast-paced', 'great', 'HBO', 'Wire', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'breakneck', 'Shield', 'wholly', 'engaging', 'very', 'different', 'way', 'Wire', 'draws', 'slowly', 'putting', 'story', 'together', 'piece', 'piece', 'detail', 'Baltimore', 'police', 'come', 'together', 'target', 'West', 'Baltimore', 'dope', 'dealer', 'who', 'been', 'operating', 'radar', 'When', 'one', 'dealer', 'lieutenants', 'murder', 'rap', 'court', 'intimidating', 'witnesses', 'Det', 'Jimmy', 'McNulty', 'up', 'griping', 'case', 'judge', 'judge', 'higher-ups', 'police', 'department', 'pretty', 'soon', 'everyone', 'Baltimore', 'PO-leece', 'pronounce', 'mad', 'McNulty', 'sticking', 'nose', 'where', ""n't"", 'belong.On', 'top', 'when', 'detail', 'focus', 'follow', 'not', 'just', 'drugs', 'money', 'case', 'tentacles', 'start', 'reach', 'high', 'places', 'What', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'was', 'way', 'show', 'detailed', 'various', 'workings', 'wiretap', 'operation', 'one', 'character', 'second', 'season', 'detective', 'who', ""n't"", 'enough', 'action', 'case', ""'re"", 'putting', 'people', 'jail', 'using', 'wiretaps', 'typewriters', 'show', 'also', 'frank', 'look', 'West', 'Baltimore', 'drug', 'trade', 'town', 'what', 'other', 'crime', 'there', 'one', 'detective', 'asks', 'higher-ups', 'down', 'street-level', 'teenage', 'dealers.The', 'focus', 'particular', 'young', 'crews', 'actually', 'slang', 'dope', 'was', 'interesting', 'One', 'storyline', 'way', 'baby', 'slanger', 'feels', 'aftermath', 'having', 'been', 'responsible', 'torture', 'death', 'neighborhood', 'rip-n-runner', 'stick-up', 'man', 'who', 'drug', 'dealers', 'hands', 'crew', 'pretty', 'powerful', 'tale.The', 'show', 'chock', 'full', 'memorable', 'characters', 'suits', 'who', 'run', 'McNulty', 'homicide', 'unit', 'who', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'totally', 'concerned', 'unit', 'clearance', 'rate', 'believe', 'Wendell', 'Davis', 'portrayal', 'hilarious', 'drunken', 'Det', 'Bunk', 'Moreland', 'McNulty', 'partner', 'one', 'scene', 'Moreland', 'McNulty', 'surprised', 'what', 'find', 'recreation', 'crime', 'scene', 'use', 'only', 'f', 'word', 'five', 'minutes', 'hilarious', 'Omar', 'joke', 'homosexual', 'rip-n-runner', 'who', 'people', 'shotgun', 'many', 'series', 'funniest', 'lines', 'somehow', 'manages', 'inject', 'tenderness', 'very', 'icy', 'character.The', 'ending', ""n't"", 'have', 'slam-bang', 'excitement', 'lot', 'other', 'season', 'finales', 'do', 'then', 'again', 'probably', 'more', 'indicative', 'way', 'cases', 'really', 'do', 'end', 'do', ""n't"", 'nail', 'everyone', 'lot', 'people', 'walk', 'away', 'unhappy.It', 'very', 'realistic', 'still', 'consistently', 'very', 'entertaining', 'hard', 'balance', 'strike', 'HBO', 'creator', 'David', 'Simon', 'have', 'done']",The Wire: Season 1
832307,AUDSM2CTLLW1Q,B0002ERXC2,Patrick L. Randall,"[2, 2]","""The Wire"" is one of those truly great pieces of television cinema.  It's a show that, even in its weakest moments, still entertains, shocks and compels the viewer.  Baltimore is known for being the home of the Star Spangled Banner, the Orioles and Ravens, the great Harbor, Aquarium, and Science Center.  It's also known for its seedier side of rundown tenements which are fertile ground for rampant crime.  In a way that few other crime dramas have (Baltimore-based ""Homicide"" included), ""The Wire"" goes straight to the brutal core of the lives and motivations of the criminals, the police officers who are pursuing them and the politicians who may be hedging their bets with both.Season 1 sets the table masterfully as troubled detective, Jimmy McNulty (Dominic West), learns about a shadowy drug organization called the `Barksdale Gang', so named after its leader, Avon Barksdale (Wood Harris).  Jimmy has numerous sources that keep him close enough to the street that he hears about this group that the rest of Baltimore PD hasn't not heard of (due to Barksdale's expert control of information).  After stirring up enough pots to get senior administration interested in taking down the crew, McNulty is assigned to a task force of seemingly screwed up, but enormously talented, street and investigative police officers.The series name is a reference to the wire taps (on land line phones and cellular phones) that the task force makes use of to get intel to work against Barksdale.  There are some great scenes involving how the criminal empire is structured,  how information is compartmentalized and how they manage to stay one step ahead of the cops (such as using temporary cell phones called `burners').In addition to the great narrative and background of ""The Wire"", this series also benefits from an astounding array of truly memorable characters, such Lester, Bunk, Bubbles, Senator Clay Harris (`sheeeeeeeeeeeet'), Prop Joe, Stringer Bell (Barksdale's second in command), and the ubiquitous free-agent stick up man, Omar (""Omar's Coming!!!"").Upon a first viewing, ""The Wire"" may seem to start off slow.  However, that is not a fault of the series writers.  It is simply a matter that there is so much information for the viewer to take in at first, in order to get the overall scope of the environment, that it takes a while before familiarity comes into play.  Once it does, the show really takes off and the viewer ends up realizing the slower beginning was completely necessary.Unlike other HBO series (like ""The Sopranos"") which seem to pull their punches and pull fast ones of their audience, ""The Wire"" is about a raw and honest a show as you can find.",5,A truly great crime drama,1371427200,"06 17, 2013",2013,2672,"['Wire', 'one', 'truly', 'great', 'pieces', 'television', 'cinema', 'show', 'even', 'weakest', 'moments', 'still', 'shocks', 'compels', 'viewer', 'Baltimore', 'known', 'being', 'home', 'Star', 'Spangled', 'Banner', 'Orioles', 'Ravens', 'great', 'Harbor', 'Aquarium', 'Science', 'Center', 'also', 'known', 'seedier', 'side', 'rundown', 'tenements', 'are', 'fertile', 'ground', 'rampant', 'crime', 'way', 'few', 'other', 'crime', 'dramas', 'have', 'Baltimore-based', 'Homicide', 'included', 'Wire', 'straight', 'brutal', 'core', 'lives', 'motivations', 'criminals', 'police', 'officers', 'who', 'are', 'pursuing', 'politicians', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'hedging', 'bets', 'both.Season', '1', 'sets', 'table', 'masterfully', 'troubled', 'detective', 'Jimmy', 'McNulty', 'Dominic', 'West', 'shadowy', 'drug', 'organization', 'called', 'Barksdale', 'Gang', 'named', 'leader', 'Avon', 'Barksdale', 'Wood', 'Harris', 'Jimmy', 'numerous', 'sources', 'keep', 'close', 'enough', 'street', 'group', 'rest', 'Baltimore', 'PD', ""n't"", 'not', 'heard', 'due', 'Barksdale', 'expert', 'control', 'information', 'stirring', 'up', 'enough', 'pots', 'get', 'senior', 'administration', 'interested', 'taking', 'down', 'crew', 'McNulty', 'assigned', 'task', 'force', 'seemingly', 'screwed', 'up', 'enormously', 'talented', 'street', 'investigative', 'police', 'officers.The', 'series', 'name', 'reference', 'wire', 'taps', 'land', 'line', 'phones', 'cellular', 'phones', 'task', 'force', 'use', 'get', 'intel', 'work', 'Barksdale', 'are', 'great', 'scenes', 'involving', 'how', 'criminal', 'empire', 'structured', 'how', 'information', 'compartmentalized', 'how', 'manage', 'stay', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'cops', 'such', 'using', 'temporary', 'cell', 'phones', 'called', 'burners', '.In', 'addition', 'great', 'narrative', 'background', 'Wire', 'series', 'also', 'benefits', 'astounding', 'array', 'truly', 'memorable', 'characters', 'such', 'Lester', 'Bunk', 'Bubbles', 'Senator', 'Clay', 'Harris', 'sheeeeeeeeeeeet', 'Prop', 'Joe', 'Stringer', 'Bell', 'Barksdale', 'second', 'command', 'ubiquitous', 'free-agent', 'stick', 'up', 'man', 'Omar', 'Omar', 'Coming', '.Upon', 'first', 'viewing', 'Wire', 'may', 'seem', 'start', 'off', 'slow', 'However', 'not', 'fault', 'series', 'writers', 'simply', 'matter', 'so', 'much', 'information', 'viewer', 'take', 'first', 'order', 'get', 'overall', 'scope', 'environment', 'while', 'familiarity', 'play', 'show', 'really', 'viewer', 'up', 'realizing', 'slower', 'beginning', 'was', 'completely', 'other', 'HBO', 'series', 'Sopranos', 'seem', 'pull', 'punches', 'pull', 'fast', 'ones', 'audience', 'Wire', 'raw', 'honest', 'show', 'can', 'find']",The Wire: Season 1

It took me a while before I really discovered this drama since I was following most HBO big hit dramas.  But, I think this series definitely deserves credit for story-telling and character development.  I can only compare this with other dramas on HBO which require strong committment to your Sunday night life and also cable subscription.  Well, that all changed with DVDs which are pricey with HBO compared with network dramas.  I guess that's what you get when you have big budgets with really good dramas.  Recently, HBO has been having deals on their older series so this isn't a problem if you keep your eyes open to Sunday ads.  That's how I got caught into this series and it kept me on the edge of my seat.  Alot of new faces with strong talent makes this drama rolling.  I tried to follow typical crime dramas like CSI and Law & Order but I lose interest fast.  This drama actually has a detailed drawn-out plot which builds up momentum for the whole season unlike your typically weekly show that neatly wraps up the plot that night.  You then appreciate that HBO brought this show to light even though it hasn't gotten the real appreciation from others.The DVDs are packaged quite nicely like most HBO season sets are typically released.  There are not much frills on this DVD set as most TV DVD releases, but that's fine with most people who have little patience to sit through commentaries and deleted scenes.

832319,A2VDLWH94XAKBP,B0002ERXC2,Prism,"[0, 0]","I binge watched all 5 seasons in the last two weeks, so that might say something. The first season is easily the best out of all of them. I would give it five stars. The characters are great. The story moves along. The writing is crisp and tight. The second season starts to get sloppy. It isn't about being complex or not. It just feels like so much of the story was unresolved and never really made it out of earlier draft stages. That theme carries through the rest of the show. However, the original characters and the relationships among them keep you going through the whole show. The new characters that enter the picture, and sometime replace the old ones (I won't say which) are never as interesting as the originals in the way West Wing continued to add great characters through at least four seasons. They are either devoid of personality or they seem a bit of caricature.Never expect the sweeping positivism of a show like West Wing. This is a gritty drama and it takes you into the crap of society, and not in just the drug ridden streets at that. It shows you the scum at the highest levels. This show is definitely not black hats and white hats. Good guys are flawed and do some bad things, and the bad guys have some redeeming values and do some honorable things. There is a lot of gray.  It is the interweaving of characters (mostly original), personalities and situations that does get you hooked. All i all, it's life and more real than any &#34;reality show.&#34;It can get confusing, as there are a lot of chacters to keep track of. I frequently referred to wiki episodes guides to look up look up characters. If you are googling characters, use episode guides because otherwise you see many big spoilers (this one gets killed, this one survives, these two break up, these two get together, whatever).The one thing that this show is, unfortunately, is very truthful. I have worked closely with all the types of people in this show (cops, journalists, politicians, community leaders and educators). The depiction of of how much greed, unsavory politics and personal agendas constantly overcome true achievement is all too real. And like real life, it is often the ones looking out only for themselves are the ones who win in the beginning, middle and end. But not always. Some of them lose. At the same time, as the show reveals, changing the system will not be easy, as the system is entrenched and there are so many moving pieces, one can't possibly hope to change the whole system.You will get 'hooked' just like an addict on the great 'product&#34; they are selling. You will know you saw a great show. You will be driven to find out what happens to characters. You just might not always feel great about it, just like the cops don't always don't feel great about their work. But like the cops, you will have those great moments where you can only relish loudly among friends in Irish pub or quietly in parking lot chucking empty beer cans up on a roof. Or quietly, where the whole messed up world might not see it or value it, but you know you did the right thing.Plan on losing the next few weeks once you start watching.",4,"Addictive like the stuff being sold, but not always good",1402790400,"06 15, 2014",2014,3147,"['binge', 'watched', '5', 'seasons', 'last', 'two', 'weeks', 'might', 'say', 'something', 'first', 'season', 'easily', 'best', 'would', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'characters', 'are', 'great', 'story', 'moves', 'along', 'writing', 'crisp', 'tight', 'second', 'season', 'get', 'sloppy', ""n't"", 'being', 'complex', 'not', 'just', 'feels', 'so', 'much', 'story', 'was', 'unresolved', 'never', 'really', 'made', 'earlier', 'draft', 'stages', 'theme', 'rest', 'show', 'However', 'original', 'characters', 'relationships', 'keep', 'going', 'whole', 'show', 'new', 'characters', 'enter', 'picture', 'sometime', 'replace', 'old', 'ones', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'are', 'never', 'as', 'interesting', 'originals', 'way', 'West', 'Wing', 'continued', 'add', 'great', 'characters', 'least', 'four', 'seasons', 'are', 'devoid', 'personality', 'seem', 'bit', 'caricature.Never', 'expect', 'sweeping', 'positivism', 'show', 'West', 'Wing', 'gritty', 'drama', 'crap', 'society', 'not', 'just', 'drug', 'ridden', 'streets', 'scum', 'highest', 'levels', 'show', 'definitely', 'not', 'black', 'hats', 'white', 'hats', 'Good', 'guys', 'are', 'flawed', 'do', 'bad', 'things', 'bad', 'guys', 'have', 'redeeming', 'values', 'do', 'honorable', 'things', 'lot', 'gray', 'interweaving', 'characters', 'mostly', 'original', 'personalities', 'situations', 'get', 'hooked', 'i', 'life', 'more', 'real', '34', 'reality', 'show.', '34', 'can', 'get', 'confusing', 'are', 'lot', 'chacters', 'keep', 'track', 'frequently', 'referred', 'wiki', 'episodes', 'guides', 'look', 'up', 'look', 'up', 'characters', 'are', 'googling', 'characters', 'use', 'episode', 'guides', 'otherwise', 'see', 'many', 'big', 'spoilers', 'one', 'killed', 'one', 'two', 'break', 'up', 'two', 'get', 'together', 'one', 'thing', 'show', 'unfortunately', 'very', 'truthful', 'have', 'worked', 'closely', 'types', 'people', 'show', 'cops', 'journalists', 'politicians', 'community', 'leaders', 'educators', 'depiction', 'how', 'much', 'greed', 'unsavory', 'politics', 'personal', 'agendas', 'constantly', 'overcome', 'true', 'achievement', 'too', 'real', 'real', 'life', 'often', 'ones', 'looking', 'out', 'only', 'are', 'ones', 'who', 'win', 'beginning', 'middle', 'end', 'not', 'always', 'lose', 'same', 'time', 'show', 'changing', 'system', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'easy', 'system', 'entrenched', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'moving', 'pieces', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'hope', 'change', 'whole', 'system.You', 'will', 'get', ""'hooked"", 'just', 'addict', 'great', ""'product"", '34', 'are', 'selling', 'will', 'know', 'saw', 'great', 'show', 'will', 'be', 'driven', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'characters', 'just', 'might', 'not', 'always', 'feel', 'great', 'just', 'cops', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'great', 'work', 'cops', 'will', 'have', 'great', 'moments', 'where', 'can', 'only', 'relish', 'loudly', 'friends', 'Irish', 'pub', 'quietly', 'parking', 'lot', 'chucking', 'empty', 'beer', 'up', 'roof', 'quietly', 'where', 'whole', 'messed', 'up', 'world', 'might', 'not', 'see', 'value', 'know', 'did', 'right', 'thing.Plan', 'losing', 'next', 'few', 'weeks', 'once', 'start', 'watching']",The Wire: Season 1

I watched every show on HBO, and then when the series came out on DVD, my first request was for 'The Wire'. Once you have seen one show, you cannot stop. You know this because you are reading this review and have found it to be so true.I have become entranced with every character- McNulty, Daniels, Greggs, Freamen, Moreland, Hauck, Sydnor, Rawls, Burrell, Norris, and Omar, Barksdale and Bubbles. All the detectives in Baltmore, their superiors, the street gang, and the people, the innocent people. David Simon the writer who gave us 'The Wire' wanted us to get to know all of them. we started to care about them. 'Damn, that Rawls for putting McNulty in such a position. Burrell, protecting all of his cronies, thinking he was doing his job...but we knew better. The streets, the drugs, the terror, the blood and guts all of this so unreal to most of us. I thought many times, there but for the grace of God is me, there but for the benefit of my birth, I was given the good life, a white middle class life. The good and the evil, the crime that these brave detectives try to wipe out, day by day, doing the best job they can and becoming proud of the job they are doing. How can we not love this series? I finished year one in two days. I have seen it before, but I picked up new highlights- oh how I love this series.In Season One, the police tried to infiltrate the West Baltimore drug ring. We saw the crime and evil, up close and personal. Yet,we find nothing is done in the real world. David Simon said ""We are a culture without the will to seriously examine our own problems. We eschew that which is complex, contradictory or confusing. As a culture, we seek simple solutions. We enjoy being provoked and titillated, but resist the rigorous, painstaking examination of issues that might, in the end, bring us to the point of recognizing our problems, which is the essential first step to solving any of them.""Really, you must view this series again.

Now, thanks to Amazon Instant Video, I have been able to binge-watch the entire first season again.  Needless to say, I am a big fan of The Wire and really wanted to give it five stars.  But to be honest, there were a few areas for improvement in the first season that subsequently did get better in future seasons.  The major complaint is the pacing and the payoff.  Yes, The Wire is a slow-moving storm and that is one of its strengths, yet there were times in the first season where the pace really was too slow.  As Detective Freeman said, all the pieces matter, but at the same time, it's tough to know what we're looking at when there is so much to decipher.  As far as the payoff goes, it's slightly annoying that the big payoff for this season really does not occur within the season.

It probably sat there for a year.  Then on a whim one cold winter evening, I decided to pop it in the DVD player.  I thought the first episode was good, but not earth shattering as many of the reviews on this site suggest.  But, I nonetheless stuck with it.  By the sixth or seventh episode, I was completely hooked.  What magnificent storytelling with fully realized, complex characters!  No one is perfect in this series, and everyone is flawed a a major way.  And what I like most is the writers' willingness to make drug dealers  - who, let's face it, are not viewed with much sympathy by damn near anyone - look, talk and act like real human beings (who can be just as fascinating as the people we more traditionally choose to admire).  THE WIRE is television at its finest - it simply doesn't get any better.  But here's a kicker for you - this series never won a single major television award.  NOT ONE!!! When I think about it, it's probably a good thing - a real testament to its uncompromising superiority to much of the other mindless garbage on television.

832334,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,B0002ERXC2,Robert J. Crawford,"[5, 5]","I came to this series with very very high expectations:  it is supposed to be realistic with ambiguous outcomes and the realization of a wider tableau than normally expected in pat cop melodramas.  I was astonished to find that it surpassed my expectations by an order of magnitude, to the point that I unequivocally believe that this is the best coherent drama that I have ever seen on TV.  This isn't about taut drama that is self-contained in a single episode and full of deus ex machina resolutions, but a long multifaceted narrative with complex characters and deep themes on urban America at a time of industrial decline.  The acting - all by relative unknowns who are perfectly cast - could not be better:  the subtlety and slow evolution of the characters is unprecedented in my view, as is the realism.  You get difficult careers, vital political issues, and damaged personal lives, all while fulfilling the calling of being ""a police"".  I have never seen anything like it.In this first season, a team slowly coalesces into a wonderful combination of talent, fanatical focus, and mission.  McNulty is the emotional focus of the team:  he is a screwup with an alcohol problem, but a great cop.  His family life is a disaster, his career in ruins because of his failures to play the politics.  Gifted with raw charm and a maniacal focus on getting the bad guys, he finds a way to become a member in an extraordinary team.  Though he has many internal enemies, there are many people of great talent he can latch onto.  He is a realistic participant in the Baltimore ecosystem of struggling workers in a deindutrialized economy, sociopathic drug dealers, corrupted politicians, and caring citizens, including cops.  One of his greatest enemies is the need to maintain statistics in the drug war, going for short-term showiness that hinders deeper investigations into crime lords who are entering legitimate businesses.The underworld is a parallel universe with its own rituals and ethic.  The characters in it are also great, with vividly believable nicknames, like string and little man, and they are realistic personalities.  There are outcasts in it who are parasites in conflict with the organized crime figures who are corrupting politics in the city (e.g. Omar v. Stringer), pathetic junkies who try to survive (e.g. Bubbles), and young ghetto rats trying to make it and willing to murder their adversaries to do so.What is the most interesting, for me, was the portrayal of the extraordinary intricacy, each with its uncertainties and consequences, of the way that a prosecutorial case must be put together.  While somewhat successful, it leaves much to be done, in the next seasons.  There are baddies pursued, and their organization in all its intricate parts become potential targets in a legal proceedings, with wonderful lawyers developing them with egotistical judges.Each episode is dense, but dependent on the others and ever more densely complex.  You can watch them multiple times, with deeper perception of them at each viewing.  It is best not to watch too many in one sitting, but at most 2 per evening.This is some of the best TV I have ever experienced.

In this case the main villian is Avon Barksdale, who is the top kingpin in a family run drug empire. You have a squad of police officers and detectives out to bring down his street empire through use of the wire (tapping public phones and business offices that Barksdale and his associates use). Yet Barksdale isn't some young thoughtless moron. He has the IQ boarding genius level, and he's got public officials and people in high places in his pocket. Taking him down or even putting a dent in the drug traffic on the Baltimore streets will take more than just a few simple arrests. What I like about this series is that there really isn't a line between good and evil. Meaning that there is actually a very deep human drama, real acting going on here.

832344,AO6U3C5QH8CON,B0002ERXC2,"Samuel Louis ""raisindot""","[1, 1]","I watched all of the The Wire when it originally aired, and now I'm rewatching the entire series again. In all of the passing years, I don't think any other series has surpassed it in terms of amazing writing, acting, and a take-no-prisoners narrative style that neither dumbs down nor sentimantalizes a single thing.Is the first season of The Wire the best? One could argue that it is, because it was so new and groundbreaking at the time that David Simon and Co. didn't have the ""How are we going to outdo this"" onus that marred Season 2 and occasionally caused narrative lapses in seasons 3, 4 and 5. It's also the strongest season because the narrative focused solely on developing the stories of the ""poh-lice"" and the criminals. It didn't let ""bigger"" issues like corruption on the docks, mayoral elections or the plight of city newspapers dilute this central premise. For the most part, The Wire was able to successfully integrate these themes into the main narrative without ever jumping the shark, even in its weakest episodes.Some people claim that the pace of the first season is slow, particularly those who were hooked by the images of the computers and phone lines displayed in the opening sequences. But this pace reflected the true difficulty of getting things done in a post 9/11 law enforcement environment, when all attention and funds were diverted to monitoring library card use rather than combating good old fashioned drug dealers and gang violence. These cops aren't heroes; they're flawed, lazy, alcoholic, career- focused, bigoted, abusive and, except for lone wolves like McNulty, Kima and Freeman, generally fearful of rocking the boat. In short, they're human. Just like many of the crew in the Low-Risers are. A teenage dealer wakes up a bunch of homeless kids living in a decrepit apartment and sends them off to school. D'Angelo Barksdale, boss of the drug pit, shows genuine remorse when confronted with the death of an a witness who had testified against him even though he wasn't responsible for the man's death. In the face of unsparing poverty and hopelessness, they occasionally try to do good.If there is one episode of Season 1 that stands out, it's the fourth episode, written by Simon. It features the hilariously vulgar defense of McNulty by his self-effacing sargeant, and Lester Freeman's backstory. But the true stand-out scene occurs when McNulty and his partner Bunk are meticulously re-examining a long-dormant murder scene. As they place crime scene photos and wield tape measures and explore every surface in a kitchen where the shooting had taken place, the only word either man speaks for nearly five minutes is the f-word and variations therefor. But it's not spoken merely as an expletive, but as an adjective, an adverb, a question, an answer, and a hypothetical. Such a scene shouldn't work at all; its sheer audacity calls attention to its artifice, but somehow it works because the two cops have worked so closely together they can use a single word to communicate everything with each other. For this scene alone, the entire first season is worth purchasing.",5,Perhaps the best of perhaps the best series ever.,1357171200,"01 3, 2013",2013,3118,"['watched', 'Wire', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', 'now', ""'m"", 'rewatching', 'entire', 'series', 'again', 'passing', 'years', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'other', 'series', 'surpassed', 'terms', 'amazing', 'writing', 'acting', 'take-no-prisoners', 'narrative', 'style', 'dumbs', 'down', 'sentimantalizes', 'single', 'thing.Is', 'first', 'season', 'Wire', 'best', 'One', 'could', 'argue', 'was', 'so', 'new', 'groundbreaking', 'time', 'David', 'Simon', 'Co.', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'How', 'are', 'going', 'outdo', 'marred', 'Season', '2', 'occasionally', 'caused', 'narrative', 'lapses', 'seasons', '3', '4', '5', 'also', 'strongest', 'season', 'narrative', 'focused', 'solely', 'developing', 'stories', 'poh-lice', 'criminals', 'did', ""n't"", 'let', 'bigger', 'issues', 'corruption', 'docks', 'mayoral', 'elections', 'plight', 'city', 'newspapers', 'dilute', 'central', 'premise', 'most', 'part', 'Wire', 'was', 'able', 'successfully', 'integrate', 'themes', 'main', 'narrative', 'ever', 'jumping', 'shark', 'even', 'weakest', 'episodes.Some', 'people', 'claim', 'pace', 'first', 'season', 'slow', 'particularly', 'who', 'were', 'hooked', 'images', 'computers', 'phone', 'lines', 'displayed', 'opening', 'sequences', 'pace', 'reflected', 'true', 'difficulty', 'getting', 'things', 'done', 'post', '9/11', 'law', 'enforcement', 'environment', 'when', 'attention', 'funds', 'were', 'diverted', 'monitoring', 'library', 'card', 'use', 'rather', 'combating', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'drug', 'dealers', 'gang', 'violence', 'cops', 'are', ""n't"", 'heroes', ""'re"", 'flawed', 'lazy', 'alcoholic', 'career-', 'focused', 'bigoted', 'abusive', 'lone', 'wolves', 'McNulty', 'Kima', 'Freeman', 'generally', 'fearful', 'rocking', 'boat', 'short', ""'re"", 'human', 'Just', 'many', 'crew', 'Low-Risers', 'are', 'teenage', 'dealer', 'up', 'bunch', 'homeless', 'kids', 'living', 'decrepit', 'apartment', 'off', 'school', ""D'Angelo"", 'Barksdale', 'boss', 'drug', 'pit', 'genuine', 'remorse', 'when', 'confronted', 'death', 'witness', 'who', 'had', 'testified', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'responsible', 'man', 'death', 'face', 'unsparing', 'poverty', 'hopelessness', 'occasionally', 'try', 'do', 'good.If', 'one', 'episode', 'Season', '1', 'out', 'fourth', 'episode', 'written', 'Simon', 'hilariously', 'vulgar', 'defense', 'McNulty', 'self-effacing', 'sargeant', 'Lester', 'Freeman', 'backstory', 'true', 'stand-out', 'scene', 'when', 'McNulty', 'partner', 'Bunk', 'are', 'meticulously', 're-examining', 'long-dormant', 'murder', 'scene', 'place', 'crime', 'scene', 'photos', 'wield', 'tape', 'measures', 'explore', 'surface', 'kitchen', 'where', 'shooting', 'had', 'taken', 'place', 'only', 'word', 'man', 'nearly', 'five', 'minutes', 'f-word', 'variations', 'therefor', 'not', 'spoken', 'merely', 'expletive', 'adjective', 'adverb', 'question', 'answer', 'hypothetical', 'scene', 'should', ""n't"", 'work', 'sheer', 'audacity', 'attention', 'artifice', 'somehow', 'two', 'cops', 'have', 'worked', 'so', 'closely', 'can', 'use', 'single', 'word', 'communicate', 'everything', 'other', 'scene', 'alone', 'entire', 'first', 'season', 'worth', 'purchasing']",The Wire: Season 1

I've read a number of places that this is an excellent series, so I thought I'd give it a try.This has a large cast, and it takes a while to put every one of them in their place.  You've got your politicians, your police, your detectives, your FBI, your reporters, your drug runners, your murderers, your spouses, your lovers, and your drug kingpins.  Wow!  And those are just the main characters.The conceit of the series is that the police must get judges (oops, forgot them in the cast...) to approve wiretaps.  In the first season, that means the pay phones that the drug runners and drug middlemen use to run their drug trade, primarily in the projects.The cast is outstanding.  The setting is good, the photography great.I liked the first series, even though the ending is sort of a let down because there are many loose ends.  However, that just sets up the second season.Highly recommended.  It paints a picture of the intractability of shutting down drug traffic, because if you put one cadre out of business, another quickly takes its place.  After all, nature abhors a marketplace vacuum.I liked this a lot.  Season two promises to be just as good.Update:  I've seen the entire series, and all I can say is, wow!

Here the bleakness that we saw in ""The Corner"" is made more palatable, and more interesting, by contrasting ""the game"" with the machinations of the police on the other side of the line.

Whether ""The Wire"" is better or worse than other hallowed series such as ""The Sopranos,"" ""Band of Brothers,"" or ""Rome"" is immaterial - this series is, without hyperbole, magnificent.  Creator David West and co-writer Ed Burns, along with the rest of the bunch, deserve all the praise heaped upon them.Essentially, ""The Wire"" is a cop show set in Baltimore.  The drug trade is ruining this troubled city - not for nothing does Episode One open with a cop cynically discussing the fate of a dead kid with a local, and then follow it up with a murderer being acquitted because a witness has been bought off.  The lone witness who testifies is murdered almost immediately thereafter. A frustrated cop, McNulty (Dominic West) discloses to the judge that a local drug ring led by Avon Barksdale (Wood Harris) is operating with impunity, including buying off and murdering witnesses.  The judge authorizes the titular ""wire"" - wire-taps on project payphones - to nail Barksdale.The judge also raises a beef with the police force, a close-knit, regimented fraternity where rogues like McNulty are despised.  So, to keep the judge happy, the cops assemble a rag-tag squad of cast-offs and rejects, stick them with the basement, and assume the investigation goes nowhere.  But thanks to some stellar detective work, the wire starts to produce results.So far, so good. That's all to be expected in a police procedural.  But what elevates ""The Wire"" is that we don't just see the good cops tracking down the bad drug dealers.  We see the dealers and those who live with them in all their humanity.  There are good guys who deal drugs in Baltimore because that's all they have done for generations.  Adding further spice to ""The Wire"" is the rampant corruption of Baltimore police and politicians.""The Wire"" keeps the viewer jumping from plot-line to plot-line, which include such varied threads as a dealer struggling with his conscience, a cop fighting for visitation rights to his kids, a trigger-happy cop learning while on suspension that he's got a gift for data-crunching, a dealer forced to work with the cops to avenge his murdered lover, and a druggie struggling to clean himself up.  None of these plot lines is forced to walk a straight line, but all are allowed to bob and weave through the characters' lives.  Through it all, ""The Wire"" remains true to itself, and no notes ring false.Here's looking forward to Season Two.

After watching the first season of HBO's the wire I now understand that I was mistaken.  This is not to say that the Wire is necessarily a superior drama to the Shield and Homicide, but it is definitely better at the realistic portrayal of both criminals and police.  In particular the Wire's portrayal of systematic corruption; as largely entrenched, petty and venial; is unique and resonates with anyone who has had to operate within a bureaucracy.The wire is also unique in its story-telling method.  The season revolves around a single police investigation, with point of view perspectives (and major protagonists) on either side of the law.  Everyone is flawed and conflicted.  Even the best cops are either self-destructive alcoholics (McNulty) or on the take; and the criminals range from the chillingly ruthless Stringer Bell; to the conflicted D'Angelo; and the poetic professionalism of Omar.  This is a true ensemble cast, given great writing and a seamless, season long arc to work with.  As other reviewers have commented, this a novel that was written for television as you must watch it from beginning to end to get the full impact.  There is a feeling of great immediacy and authenticity throughout the production.  I give the Wire Season 1 my highest recommendation, particularly to anyone who is a fan of Homicide, the Sopranos, the Shield, Boomtown or any other dark, character driven drama with great writing and season long story arcs.",5,"Dark, gritty and cynical police procedural...",1120176000,"07 1, 2005",2005,1635,"['recently', 'had', 'believed', 'Shield', 'was', 'best', 'police', 'procedural', 'currently', 'production', 'Homicide', 'Life', 'Street', 'represented', 'pinnacle', 'genre', 'watching', 'first', 'season', 'HBO', 'wire', 'now', 'understand', 'was', 'mistaken', 'not', 'say', 'Wire', 'necessarily', 'superior', 'drama', 'Shield', 'Homicide', 'definitely', 'better', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'criminals', 'police', 'particular', 'Wire', 'portrayal', 'systematic', 'corruption', 'largely', 'entrenched', 'petty', 'venial', 'unique', 'anyone', 'who', 'had', 'operate', 'bureaucracy.The', 'wire', 'also', 'unique', 'story-telling', 'method', 'season', 'around', 'single', 'police', 'investigation', 'point', 'view', 'perspectives', 'major', 'protagonists', 'side', 'law', 'Everyone', 'flawed', 'conflicted', 'Even', 'best', 'cops', 'are', 'self-destructive', 'alcoholics', 'McNulty', 'take', 'criminals', 'range', 'chillingly', 'ruthless', 'Stringer', 'Bell', 'conflicted', ""D'Angelo"", 'poetic', 'professionalism', 'Omar', 'true', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'given', 'great', 'writing', 'seamless', 'season', 'long', 'arc', 'work', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'commented', 'novel', 'was', 'written', 'television', 'must', 'watch', 'beginning', 'end', 'get', 'full', 'impact', 'feeling', 'great', 'immediacy', 'authenticity', 'production', 'give', 'Wire', 'Season', '1', 'highest', 'recommendation', 'particularly', 'anyone', 'who', 'fan', 'Homicide', 'Sopranos', 'Shield', 'Boomtown', 'other', 'dark', 'character', 'driven', 'drama', 'great', 'writing', 'season', 'long', 'story', 'arcs']",The Wire: Season 1

832354,AJJ11F5MHN8K9,B0002ERXC2,"sfarmer76 ""sfarmer76""","[4, 6]","HBO produces The Wire, $79.99 US, which is an original drama that I've only recently discovered. The Wire is the creative vision of David Simon and Ed Burns, and skilled writers like George Pellecanos have even been caught contributing to episodes. The thing I like most about The Wire is this, it doesn't condescend to the audience. The plot is fairly intricate for a one hour drama, and there are many different characters to follow, actors to keep track of. Also, the show is fairly realistic in its portrayal of a months long investigation, wherein criminals engage in deadly but lucrative turf wars, and hard working cops face mean-spirited reprisals for simply doing their jobs. People that live in Baltimore will especially enjoy this show, since it's the setting for the drama and exteriors are shot here. There are also some good inside jokes that people from Baltimore will understand, such as when a detective holds up a Laura Lippman paperback.I was able to check out The Wire: The Complete First Season on DVD from my local library, otherwise I might never have reviewed it. Surprisingly, many DVDs (Desperate Housewives, Mr. & Mrs. Smith, Sex in the City, The Forty Year Old Virgin) can be found at the library, especially boxed sets, so I'd suggest you check out the online card catalog (and interlibrary loan & hold) at your local branch before you blow your meager paycheck at the nearest Blockbuster. If you like audiobooks, you can find many of these at the library also. Some of the actors that headline The Wire are: Dominic West, John Doman, Idris Elba, Frankie R. Faison, Larry Gilliard, Jr., Wood Harris, Deidre Lovejoy, Wendell Pierce, Lance Reddick, Andre Royo, and Sonja Sohn.Each episode of The Wire has (as an added feature) audio commentary from the writers, and it was fun to go back and listen to the commentary after watching each episode. If you don't speak english, you can listen to each episode in French or Spanish. Deaf viewers can follow along with English, French, or Spanish subtitles. The run time is 775 minutes, so I'd suggest setting aside a rainy three day weekend for maximum viewing pleasure. If you lose track while switching between disks, you can review an optional Previously On... or Next On... trailer for each episode of The Wire. The video is clean and vibrant, displayed in a 4:3 aspect ratio. The DVDs featured no biographical information about the actors featured in The Wire, so disappointingly I cannot tie names to all faces. I think all the acting was superb.Although I love the theme music by Blind Boys of Alabama, I didn't enjoy having to sit through (or click through) the show intro 13 times. When you have the whole season in a box, I think one intro is enough. I'd rather have had a short audio bumper inserted in front of episodes 2-13, and the front end credits replaced with title cards on the back end. 41 whole minutes could have been carved out of the run time if the intro were removed from 12 episodes, and this might have allowed HBO to squeeze the season onto four discs instead of five, eliminating the overdone packaging in the process. I think the actors deserve more credit than I can accord them here, because if there were any paper booklets or inserts that were supposed to accompany the box set -- well -- the library must've removed them from the slipcase. Below find a single summary for the best episode of this boxed set. Enjoy viewing!DISC 5Episode 12: Cleaning UpAfter Barksdale's supply gets confiscated in the bust, Stringer hands down new rules to the crews. Barksdale and Stringer meet with Levy to discuss their next steps, which includes the elimination of any and all persons that can connect Barksdale to the drugs. Wallace returns to the pit and asks to get put back on the crew. However, Stringer has other plans for Wallace, and asks Bodie to step up for the job. The actor that plays Wallace is absolutely phenomenal.This episode (teleplay by Pellecanos) is perhaps the strongest episode in the first season of The Wire.",4,McNulty Says This Case Needs A Wire...,1137024000,"01 12, 2006",2006,4027,"['HBO', 'Wire', '79.99', 'US', 'original', 'drama', ""'ve"", 'only', 'recently', 'discovered', 'Wire', 'creative', 'vision', 'David', 'Simon', 'Ed', 'Burns', 'skilled', 'writers', 'George', 'Pellecanos', 'have', 'even', 'been', 'caught', 'contributing', 'episodes', 'thing', 'like', 'most', 'Wire', ""n't"", 'condescend', 'audience', 'plot', 'fairly', 'intricate', 'one', 'hour', 'drama', 'are', 'many', 'different', 'characters', 'follow', 'actors', 'keep', 'track', 'Also', 'show', 'fairly', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'months', 'long', 'investigation', 'wherein', 'criminals', 'engage', 'deadly', 'lucrative', 'turf', 'wars', 'hard', 'working', 'cops', 'face', 'mean-spirited', 'reprisals', 'simply', 'doing', 'jobs', 'People', 'live', 'Baltimore', 'will', 'especially', 'enjoy', 'show', 'setting', 'drama', 'exteriors', 'are', 'shot', 'here', 'are', 'also', 'good', 'inside', 'jokes', 'people', 'Baltimore', 'will', 'understand', 'such', 'when', 'detective', 'up', 'Laura', 'Lippman', 'paperback.I', 'was', 'able', 'check', 'out', 'Wire', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'DVD', 'local', 'library', 'otherwise', 'might', 'never', 'have', 'reviewed', 'Surprisingly', 'many', 'DVDs', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'Sex', 'City', 'Forty', 'Year', 'Old', 'Virgin', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'library', 'especially', 'boxed', 'sets', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'check', 'out', 'online', 'card', 'catalog', 'interlibrary', 'loan', 'hold', 'local', 'branch', 'blow', 'meager', 'paycheck', 'nearest', 'Blockbuster', 'like', 'audiobooks', 'can', 'find', 'many', 'library', 'also', 'actors', 'headline', 'Wire', 'are', 'Dominic', 'West', 'John', 'Doman', 'Idris', 'Elba', 'Frankie', 'R.', 'Faison', 'Larry', 'Gilliard', 'Jr.', 'Wood', 'Harris', 'Deidre', 'Lovejoy', 'Wendell', 'Pierce', 'Lance', 'Reddick', 'Andre', 'Royo', 'Sonja', 'Sohn.Each', 'episode', 'Wire', 'added', 'feature', 'audio', 'commentary', 'writers', 'was', 'fun', 'go', 'back', 'listen', 'commentary', 'watching', 'episode', 'do', ""n't"", 'speak', 'english', 'can', 'listen', 'episode', 'French', 'Spanish', 'Deaf', 'viewers', 'can', 'follow', 'along', 'English', 'French', 'Spanish', 'subtitles', 'run', 'time', '775', 'minutes', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'setting', 'aside', 'rainy', 'three', 'day', 'weekend', 'maximum', 'viewing', 'pleasure', 'lose', 'track', 'switching', 'disks', 'can', 'review', 'optional', 'Previously', 'Next', 'trailer', 'episode', 'Wire', 'video', 'clean', 'vibrant', 'displayed', '4:3', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'DVDs', 'featured', 'biographical', 'information', 'actors', 'featured', 'Wire', 'so', 'disappointingly', 'can', 'not', 'tie', 'names', 'think', 'acting', 'was', 'superb.Although', 'love', 'theme', 'music', 'Blind', 'Boys', 'Alabama', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'having', 'sit', 'click', 'show', '13', 'times', 'When', 'have', 'whole', 'season', 'box', 'think', 'one', 'intro', 'enough', ""'d"", 'rather', 'have', 'had', 'short', 'audio', 'bumper', 'inserted', 'front', 'episodes', '2-13', 'front', 'end', 'credits', 'replaced', 'title', 'cards', 'back', 'end', '41', 'whole', 'minutes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'carved', 'run', 'time', 'intro', 'were', 'removed', '12', 'episodes', 'might', 'have', 'allowed', 'HBO', 'squeeze', 'season', 'four', 'discs', 'instead', 'five', 'eliminating', 'overdone', 'packaging', 'process', 'think', 'actors', 'deserve', 'more', 'credit', 'can', 'accord', 'here', 'were', 'paper', 'booklets', 'inserts', 'were', 'supposed', 'accompany', 'box', 'set', 'well', 'library', 'must', ""'ve"", 'removed', 'slipcase', 'find', 'single', 'summary', 'best', 'episode', 'boxed', 'set', 'Enjoy', 'viewing', 'DISC', '5Episode', '12', 'Cleaning', 'UpAfter', 'Barksdale', 'supply', 'confiscated', 'bust', 'Stringer', 'down', 'new', 'rules', 'crews', 'Barksdale', 'Stringer', 'meet', 'Levy', 'discuss', 'next', 'steps', 'elimination', 'persons', 'can', 'connect', 'Barksdale', 'drugs', 'Wallace', 'pit', 'get', 'put', 'back', 'crew', 'However', 'Stringer', 'other', 'plans', 'Wallace', 'Bodie', 'step', 'up', 'job', 'actor', 'Wallace', 'absolutely', 'phenomenal.This', 'episode', 'teleplay', 'Pellecanos', 'perhaps', 'strongest', 'episode', 'first', 'season', 'Wire']",The Wire: Season 1

I was not disapointed it would be the best cop show ever, except it is far more than your everyday tale of police tracking down the bad guys. The Shield showed us complex characters like Vic Mackie, but in The Wire every character, even the minor ones, have more than one side. The drug dealers are shown to have a human side with one of them looking after a group of little kids and making sure they go to school with their lunch. Another drug dealer feels uneasy when a witness against him is murdered and another struggles to shoot a mate when ordered to do so by the boss. The cops are also shown as real people. The main character, if this show can be said to have a main character, is a boozing adulterer who uses his children to trail the bad guy. Another is also a boozing adulterer but a good cop.The Wire is in the 2000s what Hill Street Blues was for the 1980s. A quantum leap in TV drama.The acting is outstanding with the prize going to Clarke Peters as Detective Lester Freamon, a good detective who rediscovers himself after 13 years in a dead end job.

It does one of the very few things that 'realistic and gritty' tv shows often never do by not forgetting to bring the humour along for the ride.The plot is relatively complex but it's never hard to follow due to the acting talents of the cast, stellar writing, and the fact that you can't help but become invested in the show. The writers make you feel like you're in safe hands and that they know where they're going, and whomever did the casting deserves a thumbs up and a pat on the head, the recessions answer to a payrise.By the time I got half-way through the first season I ended up rushing out to buy the rest of the set and said goodbye to friends and family.

I took a liking to The Wire when it first came on, then became quickly addicted. (Hmmm...is there a 12 step program for Wire addicts?)I've so far watched the first season on DVD twice. And, no that won't be ""it."" In fact, that's why I waited before writing this review. Because it's complex enough that it can't be described as a ""mere television show."" Others have said already that it's frightfully REAL! Look at it: half of the best television crime and drug/police-related dramas are from Baltimore. So is what happens on The Wire. Many argue--with good reason--that The Wire is an offshoot of ""The Corner,"" another good book and HBO miniseries also in Bal'mer. David Simon is Executive Producer of both; he even wrote the book ""The Corner"" (yes, available from Amazon.com) Even the actors: nearly all of those from The Corner have quite different roles in The Wire.Why is it so complicated? Well, you need to see it again and again to see how McNulty (Dominic West) got into such trouble with the police hierarchy. There's his dedication, the police bureucracy (numbers!) and the politicians, both their corruption (probably getting funds from drug dealers; ignoring the dealers' purchase of property to add to their booty) and on and on.Then it's the politics of how the police squad is put together. All of the actors are superb--and there's enough humor to make it worth watching too.Then there's the other acting/actors. You've got Omar, the local hit man, essentially in business to rile up the drug trade. He's gay in the script, yet his lover is brutally murdered by the culprits. Then there's Andre Royo's character, Bubbles. What a work of art!It's everything you could want: passion, crime, sex, violence, laughter, idiocy, family problems. Just what you wanted to see, huh? Well, I was among the several thousand who'd petitioned to bring back The Wire for a fourth season. And I'll continue to press for more seasons.By the way, a book is available on the series, ""The Wire: Truth Be Told"" which you may want to read to keep up on the series--and get lots of inside info too.

That is a landin which the police are upright and good and in which wrongdoers lackmoral quality. A land in which the solving of crime is an intellectualexercise carried out by the superior mind. CSI is a modern example of ashow coming from Agatha Christie land, skilled crime sceneinvestigators, police and public prosecutors work to bring fiendishlycunning wrongdoers to justice.The Wire is from somewhere else all together it is from reality land.The opening to the Wire is a murder trial when an open and shut casecollapses because witnesses have been bribed. A judge asks a homicideinvestigator what has happened following the end of the trial. What hashappened is that a new gang has moved into the public housing areas andtaken over the illegal drug trade. This gang has carried out at leastten murders and beaten three homicide charges. The Judge makes somecalls to try to get an investigation started into the gang.The response from the law enforcement agencies is one of outrage thatthey have been required to do some work. A number of police arereleasedfrom different departments who are seen as incompetent by their bosses.(Why lose a good officer to some other agency who will get the praisefor what they do and not you.)  The new task force is told to make somecosmetic arrests and to wind up the operation. The original homicideinvestigator who tipped of the Judge is called McNulty. He isimmediately seen by his superiors as a trouble maker who is distractingthem from doing what they like to do which is clear up homicides. Closethe file and give it to a DA but not be really concerned if there willbe a conviction or if the gang who carried out the hit will be closeddown. McNulty wants to do things and must be leaned on.The series is remarkable as it must be seen as a whole. The episodes donot stand alone well and what makes the series good is the portrayal ofthe dynamics of the operation and the reality of dealing with seriousdrug crime. Over the series each of the members of the unit is affectedby what they are doing. Some who are have been incompetent start tolearn the complexity of serious police work. Others who were wronglysidelined are able to demonstrate their skills and the depth of theirknowledge. Others just fail and fall by the wayside.This is only half the story. One of the key attractions of the seriesis the realistic portrayal of the drug trafficking gang. No cardboardcut out villains like in Agatha Christie but characters who have beendealt certain cards in life and know how to play them. Violence andmurder are the key to survival and the running of the gang. Yet some ofthe characters have a certain nobility. Of course to achievesignificantevil gang members have to have sufficient skills to lead and inspiretheir followers in what they do. If they have no skills they would beineffectual criminals.The quality of the writing in the series is outstanding. Watching thisseries (I saw half of it during a weekend) one realizes the hackneyednature of so much that passes for crime fiction. The dialogue is greatand the characterization is such that one is drawn to all thecharacterseven the most flawed.

I love that the filmmakers respect us as the audience, respects the skills of the actors and the work of the writers and even respects the criminals that are so much a part of the story. If you like your crime dramas one-dimensional this is not going to sit well with you. There are times when you really quite like some of the bad guys and when you despise some of the ""good"" guys. For this viewer, at least, that feels like real life.Watch this if you like dramas like Homicide: Life of the Streets, Deadwood, Six Feet Under, The Sopranos. I know those are all quite different, but they're at the same high level. Actually, I think The Wire is better than any of them. Ever watch The Sopranos thinking that this is pretty good stuff but that you're kinda getting tired of seeing these creeps commit random acts of violence? I felt that way through the four seasons of the series that I watched. But The Wire never feels gratuitous. It's never violent or sexy just to titillate the viewers.This is the best real life cop drama out there, in a whole different league than the glossy CSI stuff. Highly recommended. And if you do start it stick with it. The series builds slowly, picking up steam as we come to know the characters over time and as the plot becomes ever more complex.",5,Best of the Best,1141516800,"03 5, 2006",2006,1383,"[""'m"", 'one', 'who', 'series', 'intelligent', 'credible', 'complex', 'everyone', 'love', 'filmmakers', 'respect', 'audience', 'skills', 'actors', 'work', 'writers', 'even', 'criminals', 'are', 'so', 'much', 'part', 'story', 'like', 'crime', 'dramas', 'one-dimensional', 'not', 'going', 'sit', 'well', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'really', 'quite', 'bad', 'guys', 'when', 'despise', 'good', 'guys', 'viewer', 'least', 'feels', 'real', 'life.Watch', 'like', 'dramas', 'Homicide', 'Life', 'Streets', 'Deadwood', 'Six', 'Feet', 'Sopranos', 'know', 'are', 'quite', 'different', ""'re"", 'same', 'high', 'level', 'Actually', 'think', 'Wire', 'better', 'Ever', 'watch', 'Sopranos', 'thinking', 'pretty', 'good', 'stuff', ""'re"", 'kinda', 'getting', 'tired', 'seeing', 'creeps', 'commit', 'random', 'acts', 'violence', 'felt', 'way', 'four', 'seasons', 'series', 'watched', 'Wire', 'never', 'gratuitous', 'never', 'violent', 'sexy', 'just', 'titillate', 'viewers.This', 'best', 'real', 'life', 'cop', 'drama', 'there', 'whole', 'different', 'league', 'glossy', 'CSI', 'stuff', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'do', 'start', 'stick', 'series', 'slowly', 'picking', 'up', 'steam', 'come', 'know', 'characters', 'time', 'plot', 'ever', 'more', 'complex']",The Wire: Season 1
832388,A3N5XIM9R2OQH0,B0002ERXC2,Wheelchair Assassin,"[297, 315]","Over the last two decades I've watched a great deal of television, maybe even more than the average for my generation, and out of all of it The Wire is doubtless the most challenging and important show I've ever seen, leaving even other classics like The Shield and The Sopranos in its dust, and this first season remains its defining document.  All thirteen of these episdoes are filled with amazingly detailed and complex storytelling, sharp characterization, and endless insights into the nature of modern crime and punishment--and they're mighty exciting to watch, to boot.  The whole season covers the participants in a single case, as an impromptu squad of cops is assembled to bring down the housing-project drug empire of Avon Barksdale and Stringer Bell, but the implications of the investigation, and the show's ambitions, stretch far beyond one tiny front in the interminable drug war.  We watch the case, built almost entirely on electronic surveillance (hence the title) come together piece by piece from the ground up, with the emotional stakes and social relevance being ratcheted up consistently along the way, right up until a harrowing conclusion that takes up the last two episodes.  Watching the Wire, one thing is certain: Law and Order this ain't; you'll be thinking about it a lot longer afterward.Even if nothing else, season one of The Wire would be notable for its narrative structure, which represents a new twist of the serialized TV format-the visual novel, with everything connected, so an event that happens in one episode can be referenced seven or eight episodes later and the viewer had better know what's going on.  The season is deliberately structured in a novelistic format, with individual episodes making up the chapters, so watching, say, the ninth episdoe of this season will get you nowhere except a state of abject confusion.  Thanks to its narrative flow, the Wire is easily the most naturalistic show I've ever watched, as the progression of events from the season's beginning to its end never feels forced or contrived.  This format demands a lot of the viewer, as it practically requires you to watch nonstop without blinking or looking away from the screen, but it proves so rewarding you'll probably want to anyway.That having been said, I can actually understand why this show's viewership is so limited (and it is REALLY limited; check the numbers).  For many, The Wire will probably be so lifelike and believable that it doesn't even function as entertainment.  In that sense, the show's greatest strength is also its (only) weakness, as there's nothing remotely sensationalistic or cliched about it, no reliance on overdirected action scenes, contrived cliffhanger endings, or improbable plot twists, which right away separates it from pretty much everything on network TV.  For all involved, the season is filled with setbacks, frustrations, and long periods of waiting for something to happen, just like real life.  The action quotient is also a lot lower than you'll find on a show like The Shield, and what violence there is is frequently disturbing, but it's always employed with a purpose, rather than just for the sake of mindless entertainment (make no mistake, I'm not opposed to a little mindless violence from time to time, but The Wire makes far more effective use of it).  The world is made to look as and feel as real as possible, as though you're actually there-no dream sequences, no haunting visions, only one extremely brief flashback-an emphasis on realism that extends to the most seemingly insignificant bits of setting and dialogue.  It all adds up to a show that's unfailingly convincing and authentic, but definitely not for those looking for an escape.Hmmm, how else can I count the ways in which The Wire wipes the floor with its competition?  Well, for another thing, the scope is just so much wider than any other crime show's, going far beyond even The Shield (a great show, but still an also-ran in comparison to The Wire) in capturing the workings of an American city in the early 21st century. David Simon himself has said the show's principal focus is on how institutions affect (and are affected by) individuals, and The Wire casts a decidely unflinching light on the functions and dysfunctions of the groups it examines.  Anyone who's part of an institution-in this case a police force, a court system or a large-scale drug organization-has to compromise his individuality to a certain extent, and the show perfectly captures the conflicts that come with the tough decisions the real world requires of its characters.  The only truly independent character on the show is Omar Little, the freelance street operator who makes his living robbing drug dealers, and he has to make the tradeoff of constant threats on his life.  The world of The Wire is a difficult and unforgiving one, where having a conscience can get you killed while someone infinitely more vicious walks, and where conscientious cops can lose out to those who know how to play the game.In yet another break with convention, there's no Tony Soprano/Vic Mackey/Greg House-style main character here around whom everything is required to revolve, at least to some extent-The Wire is about the story, and while the characters are hardly interchangeable or inconsequential, the emphasis is on fitting them all into the whole universe the show inhabits.  That said, everyone depicted in this season, from the junkies and street dealers to high-ranking cops and politicians inhabiting halls of power, is played brilliantly.  Although there isn't really a main character per se, Dominic West is sort of a first among equals as Jimmy McNulty, the self-righteous, insubordinate, irresponsible detective who turns the case into a personal crusade to prove his superior intelligence and frequently succeeds.  For all his flaws, Jimmy's a man's man, the kind of guy you can't help but like, especially since he really is smarter than pretty much everyone else around him.  After West, the biggest impression among the wire team is probably made by Lance Reddick as Cedric Daniels, the almost impossibly intense, glaring leader whose initially suspect dedication steadily grows over the course of the season.  Backing them is a whole crew of memorable characters, from the odd-couple pairing of loutish white detective Herc (Domenick Lombardozzi) and his smooth black partner Carver (Seth Gilliam); to Jimmy's trash-talking, cigar-chomping partner Bunk Moreland (Wendell Pierce); to paternal, wisdom-dispensing ex-homicide detective Lester Freamon (Clarke Peters); and of course abrasive, venal Major Bill Rawls (John Doman), who manages to save his best vitriol for Jimmy.Unlike the typical crime drama, though, The Wire's focus doesn't stop with the cops, providing a ground-up view of the inner workings of the Bell-Barksdale drug operation, from the lowest street dealers to the two leaders.  The wire team's targets aren't just plot devices, nor are they slobbering, inhuman evildoers; rather; the Barksdale-Bell Crew are just as sharply drawn and fleshed out as anyone else, with an operation whose corporate structure and intricate business practices are just as pure a distillation of American capitalism as any legitimate company's.  The incredible Idris Elba, especially, leaves an impression as Stringer, the smooth, highly intelligent, and icily calculating lieutenant who oversees Avon's operations, but he's hardly alone.  Wood Harris is all intensity all the time as Avon, while Larry Gilliard Jr. as Avon's conscience-stricken nephew D'Angelo captures all of his character's emotional conflicts without any undue melodrama.  As a whole, the experiences of the Bell-Barksdale crew provide a sad commentary on the lives of unwanted blacks in housing projects nationwide-many of them have the intelligence and motivation to be doing other things, but isolated from the mainstream of society there's nothing else for them to do.  The game is all they have, whether they want to be involved or not.So, yeah, that's pretty much it.  The emergence of TV as a respectable medium (especially in comparison to the movies) over the past decade or so has been well documented, and The Wire is definitely one of the shows leading the charge.  The show's subsequent seasons, while indisputably brilliant and still better than pretty much anything else out there, have watered down the show's formula just a little bit as they branch out in all sorts of directions, but no matter.  This season stands alone as one of the decade's crowning visual achievements.  Easily worth the time and money you'll invest in it, especially for how much time you'll spend thinking about it afterwards.",5,Even superlatives aren't enough,1161820800,"10 26,
