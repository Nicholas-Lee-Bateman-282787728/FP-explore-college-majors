Animation quality is mediocre, only slightly better than current Saturday morning fare (though the backgrounds are nice).The worst feature is the introduction, which features over 10 minutes of commercials for other DVDs. You cannot use the MENU button to skip these advertisements! You have to fast-forward over them manually. THIS IS EXTREMELY ANNOYING. I've made a copy disc to eliminate this problem, but most users will have to sit through the obnoxious spam ads over and over again. BAD PUBLISHER. NO DONUT.",3,Crude-looking; fine for small kids.

I took my friend's daughter's to see it a few weekends ago, and I agreed with their first reaction after it ended:  ""Holy Moses!""  Sure, the animation is not up to Pixar standards.  But there are surprisingly good jokes, lots of spine-tingling thrills (don't let the super-young ones see the evil Lord Licorice!), and basically a family-friendly good time that you will definitely want to replay over and over again.  My friend's daughter's are basically teenagers, but after the movie they were inpired to break out the old board game and have a ""Candyland"" tournament.
