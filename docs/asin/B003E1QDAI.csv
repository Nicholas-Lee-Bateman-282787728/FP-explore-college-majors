""La Mission "" was a really good movie.  It's a shame that it was so good, because I was the only person in the theater watching it.  This movie is about acceptance, it's about racial tolerance, tolerance of sexual preference, family and tradition.  The dramatic elements are moving, tear jerking and powerful.  The father son dynamic is very touching.  The point is that the father loved his son, even if he couldn't accept his son.  Wow, I could go on forever.

1337653,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B003E1QDAI,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[2, 2]","""La Mission"" refers to the Mission District of San Francisco, home to Che (Benjamin Bratt) and his 17 year old son Jesse (Jeremy Ray Valdez).  Che is a macho, reformed ex-convict and recovered alcoholic who raised Jesse alone, after the death of his mother when he was very young.  He works as a city bus driver, and lives for his hobby of restoring old car, turning them into ""low riders"" he takes cruising with his friends on weekend nights.Jesse is a good boy, and a good student, planning to attend UCLA in the fall.  He is also gay, a secret he has kept from his father and extended family, and has been dating a young man from a wealthy family. When Che finds photos of the two of them together, Jesse is initially thrown out of the house, and goes to live with his uncle, who tries to get the stubborn Che to reconcile with him.  Che goes on a self-destructive binge, perhaps believing God is punishing him for his earlier misdeeds.  Ultimately, fate forces Che to examine his reactions and attitudes, remembering that family and his son were once so important to him.An emotionally devastating film, ""La Mission"" paints a realistic portrait of the knee-jerk reactions of many lower-class Latino men to homosexuality, as well as the clash between traditional values and modern realizations. The film also features a unique musical score, ranging from Aztec folk music to some great, mellow classic R&B.;  The acting is first rate, especially Bratt, young Valdez, and Erika Alexander as Lena, Che's African-American neighbor who tries to make him realize what he is risking to lose.

1337656,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B003E1QDAI,Chris Pandolfi,"[3, 5]","Che Rivera (Benjamin Bratt) defines himself not merely by his ethnic and spiritual culture, but also by street culture, growing up tough and maintaining that image on a daily basis. Living in the Mission district of San Francisco, he earns the respect of his neighbors by being the very definition of masculinity: Physically strong, emotionless except for anger, able to finish a fight should one start. He's also passionate about restoring classic cars, a hobby that requires intensive manual labor. He has served time in prison, but he's now working towards reforming himself. He has quit drinking. He earns a living as a bus driver. He wants to do right by his teenage son, Jes (Jeremy Ray Valdez), who he's had to raise on his own since the death of his wife. Jes is a high school honor student who will soon graduate and head south to attend college at UCLA. Che has every reason to be proud of him.But Jes has a secret. He's gay. He doesn't know when or how he's going to tell his father. For the time being, he assumes, he will continue making school-related excuses for staying out late. Che discovers his son's secret entirely by accident, unleashing a torrent of anger that leads to a public fistfight and Jes being kicked out of his home. His son can't possibly be gay. There is, after all, a reason God created men and women. Why would he choose to be something that's so clearly wrong? Is Che being punished for his past sins? His best friend and fellow car enthusiast recounts how he asked himself the same thing when his sickly son was hospitalized. He also tells Che that, in the end, he was just glad that his son was alive. Che eventually lets Jes move back in, although we quickly realize that he hasn't really come to terms with anything. He's merely pretending that Jes is something he isn't.As father and son walk on eggshells around each other, Che begins a relationship with his new neighbor Lena (Erika Alexander), who's a caring and supportive staple at an abused woman's shelter. At the same time, she's headstrong and saddled with emotional baggage, the latter qualities revealing themselves as their attraction grows physical. Is it possible for her to love a man with such a terrible history? She's seen his kind before - violent men who have no healthy outlet for their anger. Is it possible for him realize that his macho reputation isn't getting him anywhere? And can she get him to see things from a different angle when it comes to his son?One could ask these questions all day long. But you know how men like Che are. They're stubborn. They live by an unspoken but well-understood street code. And homosexuality is a concept completely outside their range of comprehension. This is perhaps a bit broad, but Bratt manages to make his character convincing, mostly in the way he navigates the emotional range; Che can be volatile, but there are also times when he's great to be around, especially when he's with his low-rider buddies. It's also interesting to watch him around Jes - the anger, the embarrassment, the denial that allows him to treat his son with some degree of respect.We know, of course, that the problem lies not with Jes but with Che, which means he will spend the rest of the film working towards accepting his son for who he is. One of the film's more interesting approaches is that it's told from the father's perspective; it's not about the son reaching out to the father, but the father having to learn how to reach out to the son, if such a thing is even possible. It's about Che having to deal with himself before dealing with Jes. It's about coming to terms with an image that may not have much to do with the person inside. Of course, this also presents some problems, namely that it's awfully one-sided. Jes, as depicted, is so decent and likeable that he he's obviously in service of the film's message. Why couldn't he be just as flawed as his father? What if he realized he was prejudiced towards straight people?Or what about Jes' lover, Jordan (Max Rosenak)? He's an all-around pleasant guy from an affluent and supportive family, although that's pretty much the extent to which he's developed. Is there nothing more we can learn about him? Does he not have his own insecurities or weaknesses or intolerances to sort through? I began to wonder all this late in the film, when he and Che have ... an encounter; while the intent of this scene is clear, the execution comes off as overbearing. Much like Jes, Jordan is merely a plot device, solely created as a way for the filmmakers to get a point across. This could have been a great movie had it not been so insistent on telling us something we've heard many times before. As it stands, ""La Mission"" is a good movie, lacking complexity but livened up with an engaging story and believable performances.",4,I Didn't Choose to Be This Way,1278633600,"07 9, 2010",2010,4819,"['Che', 'Rivera', 'Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'not', 'merely', 'ethnic', 'spiritual', 'culture', 'also', 'street', 'culture', 'growing', 'up', 'tough', 'maintaining', 'image', 'daily', 'basis', 'Living', 'Mission', 'district', 'San', 'Francisco', 'respect', 'neighbors', 'being', 'very', 'definition', 'masculinity', 'Physically', 'strong', 'emotionless', 'anger', 'able', 'finish', 'fight', 'should', 'one', 'start', 'also', 'passionate', 'restoring', 'classic', 'cars', 'hobby', 'intensive', 'manual', 'labor', 'served', 'time', 'prison', 'now', 'working', 'towards', 'reforming', 'quit', 'drinking', 'living', 'bus', 'driver', 'do', 'right', 'teenage', 'son', 'Jes', 'Jeremy', 'Ray', 'Valdez', 'who', 'had', 'raise', 'own', 'death', 'wife', 'Jes', 'high', 'school', 'honor', 'student', 'who', 'will', 'soon', 'graduate', 'head', 'south', 'attend', 'college', 'UCLA', 'Che', 'reason', 'be', 'proud', 'him.But', 'Jes', 'secret', 'gay', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', 'how', 'going', 'tell', 'father', 'time', 'being', 'will', 'continue', 'making', 'school-related', 'excuses', 'staying', 'out', 'late', 'Che', 'son', 'secret', 'entirely', 'accident', 'unleashing', 'torrent', 'anger', 'public', 'fistfight', 'Jes', 'being', 'kicked', 'home', 'son', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'be', 'gay', 'reason', 'God', 'created', 'men', 'women', 'Why', 'would', 'choose', 'be', 'something', 'so', 'clearly', 'wrong', 'Che', 'being', 'punished', 'past', 'sins', 'best', 'friend', 'fellow', 'car', 'enthusiast', 'how', 'asked', 'same', 'thing', 'when', 'sickly', 'son', 'was', 'hospitalized', 'also', 'Che', 'end', 'was', 'just', 'glad', 'son', 'was', 'alive', 'Che', 'eventually', 'Jes', 'move', 'back', 'quickly', 'realize', ""n't"", 'really', 'come', 'terms', 'anything', 'merely', 'pretending', 'Jes', 'something', 'father', 'son', 'walk', 'eggshells', 'other', 'Che', 'relationship', 'new', 'neighbor', 'Lena', 'Erika', 'Alexander', 'who', 'caring', 'supportive', 'staple', 'abused', 'woman', 'shelter', 'same', 'time', 'headstrong', 'saddled', 'emotional', 'baggage', 'latter', 'qualities', 'revealing', 'attraction', 'physical', 'possible', 'love', 'man', 'terrible', 'history', 'seen', 'kind', 'violent', 'men', 'who', 'have', 'healthy', 'outlet', 'anger', 'possible', 'realize', 'macho', 'reputation', ""n't"", 'getting', 'anywhere', 'can', 'get', 'see', 'things', 'different', 'angle', 'when', 'son', 'One', 'could', 'ask', 'questions', 'day', 'long', 'know', 'how', 'men', 'Che', 'are', ""'re"", 'stubborn', 'live', 'unspoken', 'well-understood', 'street', 'code', 'homosexuality', 'concept', 'completely', 'range', 'comprehension', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'broad', 'Bratt', 'make', 'character', 'convincing', 'mostly', 'way', 'emotional', 'range', 'Che', 'can', 'be', 'volatile', 'are', 'also', 'times', 'when', 'great', 'be', 'around', 'especially', 'when', 'low-rider', 'buddies', 'also', 'interesting', 'watch', 'around', 'Jes', 'anger', 'embarrassment', 'denial', 'treat', 'son', 'degree', 'respect.We', 'know', 'course', 'problem', 'not', 'Jes', 'Che', 'will', 'spend', 'rest', 'film', 'working', 'towards', 'accepting', 'son', 'who', 'One', 'film', 'more', 'interesting', 'approaches', 'told', 'father', 'perspective', 'not', 'son', 'reaching', 'out', 'father', 'father', 'having', 'learn', 'how', 'reach', 'out', 'son', 'thing', 'even', 'possible', 'Che', 'having', 'deal', 'dealing', 'Jes', 'coming', 'terms', 'image', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'much', 'do', 'person', 'course', 'also', 'problems', 'namely', 'awfully', 'one-sided', 'Jes', 'depicted', 'so', 'decent', 'likeable', 'obviously', 'service', 'film', 'message', 'Why', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'just', 'as', 'flawed', 'father', 'What', 'realized', 'was', 'prejudiced', 'towards', 'straight', 'people', 'what', 'Jes', 'lover', 'Jordan', 'Max', 'Rosenak', 'all-around', 'pleasant', 'guy', 'affluent', 'supportive', 'family', 'pretty', 'much', 'extent', 'developed', 'there', 'nothing', 'more', 'can', 'learn', 'not', 'have', 'own', 'insecurities', 'weaknesses', 'intolerances', 'sort', 'began', 'wonder', 'late', 'film', 'when', 'Che', 'have', 'encounter', 'intent', 'scene', 'clear', 'execution', 'off', 'overbearing', 'Much', 'Jes', 'Jordan', 'merely', 'plot', 'device', 'solely', 'created', 'way', 'filmmakers', 'get', 'point', 'across', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'movie', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'so', 'insistent', 'telling', 'something', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'many', 'times', 'before', 'La', 'Mission', 'good', 'movie', 'lacking', 'complexity', 'livened', 'up', 'engaging', 'story', 'believable', 'performances']",La Mission

1337658,A33EN2ZL2MS0CI,B003E1QDAI,Compay,"[25, 26]","La Mission, set in the streets of San Francisco's Mission District, is easily the most powerful Latin-interest film released in years.  Peruvian leading man Benjamin Bratt's brother Peter Bratt directed the film, which focuses on the relationship between a macho bus driver and his son.Benjamin Bratt is nothing short of brilliant as the tatted-up Che Rivera, a recovering alcoholic with a passion for lowriders, and pride for the academic achievements of his son Jesse.  Bratt channels his inner pachuco with genuine swag, in a role destined for him to play.Che is old-school Chicano to the bone, which makes for tremendous conflict when he discovers his son's sexual orientation.  Rivera's son Jesse is played by Jeremy Ray Valdez, a young Latino with serious acting chops, and an infectious smile.  Valdez and Bratt share an incredible on-screen chemistry as father and son, and Rivera's intolerance is something many Hispanic viewers will recognize.  The stigma attached to homosexuality amongst old-school (and largely Roman-Catholic) Latinos is something almost never confronted in film.For those of you already saying, ""I'm not going to watch this,"" calm down.  This isn't a ""gay"" movie, but it does address issues that Latinos tend to sweep under the rug.  Jesse's orientation serves as a means of revealing who his father Che really is, and uncovering the pain and rage that needed to be healed in the ex-convict.  Helping Che battle his inner demons is Lena, the earthy and extremely sexy neighbor who works for a woman's shelter.  Played by beautiful morena Erika Alexander (of Living Single fame), Lena attempts to heal the rift between father and son, while dealing with her own fears of Che.  Before the film is over, expect plenty of love, anger, and loss.The rest of the supporting cast also make for an interesting movie.  Jesse Borrego, best remembered as the artist Cruz from Bound by Honor, is reunited on-screen with his compadre Benjamin.  Bratt's wife Talisa Soto, playing the gorgeous wife to Borrego's character, also rounds out the cast of well-known Latino actors.  One of my favorite inclusions to the cast was talented voice actor Kevin Michael Richardson, who adds plenty of great comic relief to keep the film light.Perhaps the best aspect of this film is that it's genuine.  I've seen more than a few movies that try to work in ""Latino"" themes, only to come off as gimmicky.  LA Mission is a movie with alma, real soul.  From the clothing and music to the lowriders and pachuco swagger, La Mission gets it right.  If you're a car enthusiast, the ranflas in this movie are guaranteed to put a smile on your face.

1337661,A328S9RN3U5M68,B003E1QDAI,Grady Harp,"[16, 17]","Writer/director Peter Bratt had the choice in LA MISSION to make a film about the Hispanic culture in San Francisco's Mission district to create a predictable imitation of life or a sensitive study of a culture with all of its beauty and with all of its problems: gratefully he took the latter.  This is a film bursting with fantastic color from the inimitable clash of pigments used for the interiors of the homes of this culture to the fantasyland carefully restored old cars painted with religious and emotional scenes - the proud mark of the Low Riders - and the street celebrations full of lust and glamour and the intoxicating foods and dance.  But it is also an internal film dealing with such realities as alcoholism, prison time, single parenting problems, pride in a child's educational and athletic achievements - and the delicate issue of responding to the presence of same sex relationships.  It is a banquet of delights and problems that Bratt handles magnificently well.Che Rivera (Benjamin Bratt in a role that defines his fine acting abilities) has served time in prison, is an Alcoholics Anonymous member, and since his wife's death early in their marriage is the loving father of his well-educated and well-loved son Jesse (Jeremy Ray Valdez, in a role that should mark him for an important career).  Che works hard as a bus driver, spends his free time restoring old cars to ride every Friday evening -  'slow, low riding through the streets of San Francisco's Mission neighborhood'. His family includes Rene (Jesse Borrego) and Ana (Talisa Soto) who share as much pride in Jess as Che: their only son was born with a cardiac defect that has made them more sensitive to the differences in children.  Che has only one problem: Jesse is gay and has a boyfriend Jordan (Max Rosenak) and the discovery of Jesse secret life destroys Che image of his family and of himself.  A neighbor Lena (Erika Alexander) befriends Jesse and eventually Che and Lena are draw together over a tragedy that occurs: Jesse is shot by a homophobic fellow student, forcing Che to face his own demons and begin to understand his son more fully.  The excellent way in which Bratt handles these major crossroad confrontations is written and directed and acted with such sensitivity - nothing occurs as expected and everyone maintains dignity - a very difficult range of emotions to handle.The entire cast is excellent, the dialogue is spicy, the characters are well conceived, the particular gifts of Erika Alexander as a woman with a history of abuse who is devoting her life to working in a women's shelter who allows her physical needs to be met while maintaining her ownership of a wise woman of experience are extremely well utilized, and this film offers a platform deserving of the talent of Benjamin Bratt and Jeremy Ray Valdez.  It is a tough story told with great sensitivity and truth.  Hiro Narita's cinematography and Mark Kilian's musical score round out this very fine achievement in cinematic art.

He turns in an excellent performance as the macho father who has a very difficult time after learning his son is gay.  Bratt does an excellent job of teetering between extremes.  On one hand, he is a loving father; on the other, he is a low rider filled with pride and bravado.  Thrown in to the mix is his struggle with alcoholism and his romantic reawakening with his neighbor Lena.  It is a replete performance, well worth the admission price.  As Lena, Erika Alexander turns in an incredibly powerful performace.  We see her as a recovering victim, probably of domestic violence, but also as a strong woman who balances her ideals with compassion.  Jeremy Ray Valdez plays Che's son Jes.  With his mother deceased and his father who spent time in prison, he has found his way in the world, often with the help of his uncle and aunt.  He does a good job showing an intelligent young man who doesn't quite fit into his own culture.  His love interest is Jordan, played by Max Rosenack who does a nice job as the caring young man who sticks by Jes' side through thick and thin.  Talisa Soto also turns in a caring supporting performance as Jes' aunt Ana.  ""La Mission"" is a strong film, probably not perfect, but well worth seeing.

The most enjoyable performances for me came from the female lead (Erica Alexander) and the actors who played the son and brother of Benjamin Bratt's lead. The son was everything a gay man dreams of in a husband - handsome, smart, sensitive, funny, loyal. Bratt's performance was solid, but he had a tendency to take some things too far - like saying ""know what I mean"" about a thousand times. All together the cast created a tight latino community that was the heart and soul of this story and could be felt throughout the movie. What I didn't completely understand was how a part of one of the most liberal cities in the country could still be so prejudiced against gays and at the same time be so integrated with the black community. It felt like a disconnect that might could've been bridged with more backstory to better explain the neighborhoods of San Francisco. But what the movie brought home in spades was the deep bond between father and son that ultimately survived in spite of everything thrown at it.

Bratt, plays an ex-con,who is raising a son, who he doesn't know is gay, and when he finds out, wow.  He's like an OG (original gangster), with heart.  And, the chemistry between he and Erika Alexander is very nice, as she sees both sides to Bratt's character, which is macho and kinda romantic.  The end, I don't know if that he would have given in on his strict views, especially, being a Catholic.

1337683,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B003E1QDAI,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[1, 1]","This is set in the Mission district of San Francisco and is about Che Rivera (Benjamin Bratt - `Miss Congeniality). He is an ex con, reformed alcoholic tough guy who has spent too much time in a `twattoo' parlour. By day he drives a bus and in his spare time he hangs with his homies and builds low ride classic American autos. He is something of a character in his neighbourhood - sorry `hood' and is one of those people that does kind deeds for no apparent gain, but is as tough as nails and keeps his fighting training up, just in case.He has brought up Jay (Jeremy Ray Valdez) - his only son after his wife died and has a very strong bond with him. Then a feisty new neighbour moves in and causes a certain amount of friction and his son decides to not accompany him on one of the low ride cruises as he has some study to do. And study he indeed does, although it is at a gay discorama of his white boyfriends tonsils with his tongue. Unfortunately some Polaroid's are taken and Che finds them. As a strong Latino macho man he finds this more than a little upsetting. What happens next is a story of how Che tries to deal with, what he sees as a hammer blow to all he believes in and how stunted some people's world view is. It can often take an apparent out-sider from the community to shine a light on the goodness that is right under peoples noses and this is brought to the fore.Whilst this is a story based around a boy being gay this is not really a gay film, so if that is what you are looking for then this might not be for you. All of the acting is top notch and some of the camera work is truly excellent. This though is a narrative driven plot and it does so with a great deal of care and feeling. Jay also has to deal with being outed at school and the rank homophobia of some of the bottom feeders from the hood.I really enjoyed this film from writer and director Peter Bratt who is Benjamin's brother but I am sure that did not influence why he got the gig - yeah right, well irrespective of the whiff of nepotism this is still an outstanding effort from all concerned and if a brotherly love in can come up with something this good, then let's hope they collaborate again very soon.",5,"Low Rides, Latinos', Violence in the `hood' and a Gay Disco!",1344816000,"08 13, 2012",2012,2201,"['set', 'Mission', 'district', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Che', 'Rivera', 'Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'Miss', 'Congeniality', 'ex', 'con', 'reformed', 'alcoholic', 'tough', 'guy', 'who', 'spent', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'twattoo', 'parlour', 'day', 'bus', 'spare', 'time', 'homies', 'builds', 'low', 'ride', 'classic', 'American', 'autos', 'something', 'character', 'neighbourhood', 'sorry', 'hood', 'one', 'people', 'kind', 'deeds', 'apparent', 'gain', 'as', 'tough', 'nails', 'fighting', 'training', 'up', 'just', 'case.He', 'brought', 'up', 'Jay', 'Jeremy', 'Ray', 'Valdez', 'only', 'son', 'wife', 'died', 'very', 'strong', 'bond', 'Then', 'feisty', 'new', 'neighbour', 'moves', 'certain', 'amount', 'friction', 'son', 'decides', 'not', 'accompany', 'one', 'low', 'ride', 'cruises', 'study', 'do', 'study', 'indeed', 'gay', 'discorama', 'white', 'boyfriends', 'tonsils', 'tongue', 'Unfortunately', 'Polaroid', 'are', 'taken', 'Che', 'strong', 'Latino', 'macho', 'man', 'more', 'little', 'upsetting', 'What', 'next', 'story', 'how', 'Che', 'deal', 'what', 'hammer', 'blow', 'how', 'stunted', 'people', 'world', 'view', 'can', 'often', 'take', 'apparent', 'out-sider', 'community', 'shine', 'light', 'goodness', 'right', 'peoples', 'noses', 'brought', 'fore.Whilst', 'story', 'based', 'boy', 'being', 'gay', 'not', 'really', 'gay', 'film', 'so', 'what', 'are', 'looking', 'then', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'acting', 'top', 'notch', 'camera', 'work', 'truly', 'excellent', 'though', 'narrative', 'driven', 'plot', 'so', 'great', 'deal', 'care', 'feeling', 'Jay', 'also', 'deal', 'being', 'outed', 'school', 'rank', 'homophobia', 'bottom', 'feeders', 'hood.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'writer', 'director', 'Peter', 'Bratt', 'who', 'Benjamin', 'brother', 'am', 'sure', 'did', 'not', 'influence', 'why', 'got', 'gig', 'yeah', 'right', 'well', 'irrespective', 'whiff', 'nepotism', 'still', 'outstanding', 'effort', 'concerned', 'brotherly', 'love', 'can', 'come', 'up', 'something', 'good', 'then', 'let', 'hope', 'collaborate', 'again', 'very', 'soon']",La Mission
