Keith (Freeman) and Gaby (Banderas) are master thieves who join forces to break into an impenetrable vault in NYC. Just as the two thieves are establishing their plan, Gaby starts up a steamy romance with Keith's goddaughter (Radha Mitchell). Their intense chemistry adds a sexy tone to the heist theme of the movie. As the pair puts their plan in action and outmaneuvers law enforcement and the Russian jewelers who guard the vault, alliances are put to the test. Full of suspense and shocking twists and turns, The Code is definitely worth watching.

Morgan Freeman does another great job of making us believe that he is the character.  The movie uses an old story line of something needing to be stolen.  It combines this with a love theme, family loyality, and friendship.  Who's honor will be kept?  Who's honor will be challenged?  Who really is telling the truth?

While, as I said, earlier, hardcore fans will probably guess everything well before the finish, I enjoyed the ride!The acting is very good, with Freeman as solid and reliable as ever, and Banderas displaying his typical teasing playfulness. The real standout is Mitchell, who combines cool sophistication with a fire and carnal sexuality that ignites her intimate scenes with Banderas (even surpassing his famous tryst with Salma Hayek in ""Desperado"").

Morgan Freeman brings an element of believability and fun to anything he touches. Antonio Banderas does a fine job as well as the rogue in love with a Russian girl played by Radha Mitchell. I won't spoil any surprises even though the producers of this genre seem to be creating more of this type surprise ending movie of late. To accuse this movie of being lesser because it uses this theme is unjust. Twists of this sort have been in movies far longer than any in the last twenty years. So be little this one and you be little the others.A highly experienced thief and assassin, played by Morgan Freeman, takes an unorthodox thief, played by Antonio Banderas, under his wing to do a impossibly tough heist. The target are mysterious Faberge eggs that have rarely been seen. They are housed in a Russian vault with a great deal of high tech and normal security. They are successful in getting the eggs but the ending is somewhat flashbacks of things that gave you clues as to what was really going on, just hard to realize until all is made clear.

Those movies that pit individuals against an almost impregnanble vault and which the protagonists must use cunning and expertise to overcome. Whether it be the more modern set such as ""Ocean's Eleven,"" ""Mission Impossible,"" ""Entrapment"" to the more classic such as the 1960s original ""Italian Job"" to ""11 Harrowhouse"" they all manage to weave a clever plan into an entertaining picture.Why am I giving this movie a mere three starts then? Why, because it just doesn't work. The means of achieving the heist are somewhat pedestrian at best and the protagonists use gedgetry to overcome some of the obstacles in their way. Even the obligatory ""surprise"" ending (another part of any good heist movie) seems rather forced and muddled.But we do have Morgan Freeman doing as much as can be expected with the awkward material and Antonio Banderas does a good job also, although it sometimes seems he plays his characters the same way 99 percent of the time. Freeman plays veteran thief Keith Ripley who tags up-and-coming thief Gabriel Martin (played by Banderas) to be his partner in a job to steal two faberge eggs from the vault of a Russian jeweler in New York. However the movie lacks dramatic tension and it's all a rather ho-hum experience. All in all this movie may deserve a rental, but as far as purchasing is concerned - buyer beware.The Blu-ray features an above average transfer, if nothing to write home about. The detail is rendered in the majority of the scenes, with only a few appearing less distinct and the colors appear natural. The audio track is more troublesome with some dailogue difficult to make out, though rear speakers are used to good effect.The supplemental package is largely forgettable with a series of interviews that look like they were filmed in a trailer with hideous Audio and Visual quality and a 16 minute behind the scenes feature that is largely fluff.Worth a rental.",3,Talent wasted in a forgettable heist movie,1264118400,"01 22, 2010",2010,1959,"['Let', 'get', 'right', 'there', 'love', 'heist', 'movies', 'movies', 'pit', 'individuals', 'almost', 'impregnanble', 'vault', 'protagonists', 'must', 'use', 'cunning', 'expertise', 'overcome', 'Whether', 'be', 'more', 'modern', 'set', 'such', 'Ocean', 'Eleven', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'Entrapment', 'more', 'classic', 'such', '1960s', 'original', 'Italian', 'Job', '11', 'Harrowhouse', 'manage', 'weave', 'clever', 'plan', 'entertaining', 'picture.Why', 'am', 'giving', 'movie', 'mere', 'three', 'starts', 'then', 'Why', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'means', 'achieving', 'heist', 'are', 'somewhat', 'pedestrian', 'best', 'protagonists', 'use', 'gedgetry', 'overcome', 'obstacles', 'way', 'Even', 'obligatory', 'surprise', 'ending', 'part', 'good', 'heist', 'movie', 'rather', 'forced', 'muddled.But', 'do', 'have', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'doing', 'as', 'much', 'can', 'be', 'expected', 'awkward', 'material', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'good', 'job', 'also', 'sometimes', 'characters', 'same', 'way', '99', 'percent', 'time', 'Freeman', 'veteran', 'thief', 'Keith', 'Ripley', 'who', 'tags', 'up-and-coming', 'thief', 'Gabriel', 'Martin', 'played', 'Banderas', 'be', 'partner', 'job', 'steal', 'two', 'faberge', 'eggs', 'vault', 'Russian', 'jeweler', 'New', 'York', 'However', 'movie', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'rather', 'ho-hum', 'experience', 'movie', 'may', 'deserve', 'rental', 'as', 'far', 'purchasing', 'concerned', 'buyer', 'Blu-ray', 'features', 'above', 'average', 'transfer', 'nothing', 'write', 'home', 'detail', 'rendered', 'majority', 'scenes', 'only', 'few', 'appearing', 'less', 'distinct', 'colors', 'appear', 'natural', 'audio', 'track', 'more', 'troublesome', 'dailogue', 'difficult', 'make', 'out', 'rear', 'speakers', 'are', 'used', 'good', 'effect.The', 'supplemental', 'package', 'largely', 'forgettable', 'series', 'interviews', 'look', 'were', 'filmed', 'trailer', 'hideous', 'Audio', 'Visual', 'quality', '16', 'minute', 'scenes', 'feature', 'largely', 'fluff.Worth', 'rental']",The Code

The cast is admirable enough, the story is very clever in parts and the director an experienced professional who has delivered very good movies before - yet somehow, ""The Code"" (aka ""Thick As Thieves"") just doesn't work.The idea on paper of Banderas and Freeman working together is probably what got this made - the reality of it is that there's very little chemistry between them - they come across as misfits instead of matches.It does work between Banderas and the lovely/sexy Radha Mitchell and its also fab to see Robert Forster in any movie.

1167633,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B001AR011A,Mark Turner,"[17, 18]","Film stars, like everyone else, need to work to pay their bills. Granted their incomes exceed most peoples and their bills match, but they must still work. Thus it is that we find stars featured in films that get smaller releases than most. The odd thing is that while the film may not get a wide release or go straight to DVD, it doesn't mean it isn't as good if not better than big screen fare. Such is the case with THE CODE.Morgan Freeman stars as Keith Ripley, a professional burglar who has yet to be caught. While working on his next goal he comes across a young upstart named Gabriel Martin (Antonio Banderas) and recruits him. Ripley has a huge heist planned, the culmination of his long heralded career but he needs a partner.As the story unfolds we also meet Alexandra (Radha Mitchell), the daughter of Ripley's late best friend. Alexandra has caught the eye of Gabriel, much to the chagrin of Ripley. Feeling a debt of protecting his old friend's daughter, he warns Gabriel to steer clear, which of course Gabriel ignores.It is because of his old friend that Ripley has set in motion his latest scheme. Ripley's old partner owed a debt to a group of Russian mobsters. With his untimely death, the debt was passed on to Ripley who now has no choice but to follow through with the heist they insist he go through to pay off the debt. And Alexandra is the wedge they are using to force his hand.Ripley plans to steal two unknown Faberge eggs, jewel encrusted ornaments once owned by the Russian royal family, from the Romanovs, a high class Russian jeweler. The eggs are located in their high tech vault. But this is no ordinary vault. This one is voice and fingerprint activated just to get inside the first set of doors. The even bigger problem, the main vault door itself, will take more to crack but only after they get past the security system in place first.The pair make their plans and plot out everything they can to bypass all obstacles in their way. But even Ripley knows things can go wrong as he warns Gabriel to plan for the unexpected, to learn to adapt as things move forward.Eventually the Russians capture Alexandra, now romantically involved with Gabriel, and hold her ransom until the job is finished. With time running out and the NYPD on their trail led by Ripley's long time nemesis Lt. Weber (Robert Forster) as well as the FBI, they must move forward with their plans and succeed.But in a world of thieves where a code of honor is placed between them, not all parties can be trusted. Not the Russians, not the Romanovs, not the police, not Gabriel and especially not Ripley.The story moves along at a steady pace, giving the necessary information to keep you up to speed with the plans and the plot. The romance here doesn't interfere with the story and actually helps set up characters and affections for later.Some may claim that the storyline and portions of it seem lifted from other films or familiar but the fact is when it comes to heist films there is little to differentiate one from another with the exception of the acting and pacing. Both are commendable in this film.Freeman does a great job as the wizened pro who knows the ropes and how to steer clear of a prison sentence. Banderas comes along for the ride and seems to be enjoying himself as he learns Ripley's tricks and applies some of his own along the way. Both actors play well off one another coming off as co-conspirators rather than settling for the old passing the torch along mentality seen in so many films with characters of different ages.The film offers an entertaining evening should you choose to rent it. For fans of both actors its worth adding to your collection. And it stands as proof positive that you can't judge a DVD based on the popularity of the film prior to its release. First Look Pictures has done a great job with this one. My hope is that they continue to do so in the future.",4,HONOR AMONG THIEVES?,1245974400,"06 26, 2009",2009,3910,"['Film', 'stars', 'everyone', 'else', 'need', 'work', 'pay', 'bills', 'Granted', 'incomes', 'exceed', 'most', 'peoples', 'bills', 'match', 'must', 'still', 'work', 'Thus', 'find', 'stars', 'featured', 'films', 'get', 'smaller', 'releases', 'most', 'odd', 'thing', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'get', 'wide', 'release', 'go', 'straight', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'mean', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'not', 'better', 'big', 'screen', 'fare', 'Such', 'case', 'THE', 'CODE.Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Keith', 'Ripley', 'professional', 'burglar', 'who', 'yet', 'be', 'caught', 'working', 'next', 'goal', 'young', 'upstart', 'named', 'Gabriel', 'Martin', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'Ripley', 'huge', 'heist', 'planned', 'culmination', 'long', 'heralded', 'career', 'partner.As', 'story', 'also', 'meet', 'Alexandra', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'daughter', 'Ripley', 'late', 'best', 'friend', 'Alexandra', 'caught', 'eye', 'Gabriel', 'much', 'chagrin', 'Ripley', 'Feeling', 'debt', 'protecting', 'old', 'friend', 'daughter', 'Gabriel', 'steer', 'clear', 'course', 'Gabriel', 'ignores.It', 'old', 'friend', 'Ripley', 'set', 'motion', 'latest', 'scheme', 'Ripley', 'old', 'partner', 'owed', 'debt', 'group', 'Russian', 'mobsters', 'untimely', 'death', 'debt', 'was', 'passed', 'Ripley', 'who', 'now', 'choice', 'follow', 'heist', 'insist', 'go', 'pay', 'off', 'debt', 'Alexandra', 'wedge', 'are', 'using', 'force', 'hand.Ripley', 'plans', 'steal', 'two', 'unknown', 'Faberge', 'eggs', 'jewel', 'encrusted', 'ornaments', 'once', 'owned', 'Russian', 'royal', 'family', 'Romanovs', 'high', 'class', 'Russian', 'jeweler', 'eggs', 'are', 'located', 'high', 'tech', 'vault', 'ordinary', 'vault', 'one', 'voice', 'fingerprint', 'activated', 'just', 'get', 'first', 'set', 'doors', 'even', 'bigger', 'problem', 'main', 'vault', 'door', 'will', 'take', 'more', 'crack', 'only', 'get', 'security', 'system', 'place', 'first.The', 'pair', 'make', 'plans', 'plot', 'out', 'everything', 'can', 'bypass', 'obstacles', 'way', 'even', 'Ripley', 'things', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', 'Gabriel', 'plan', 'unexpected', 'learn', 'adapt', 'things', 'move', 'forward.Eventually', 'Russians', 'capture', 'Alexandra', 'now', 'romantically', 'involved', 'Gabriel', 'hold', 'ransom', 'job', 'finished', 'time', 'running', 'out', 'NYPD', 'trail', 'led', 'Ripley', 'long', 'time', 'nemesis', 'Lt.', 'Weber', 'Robert', 'Forster', 'as', 'well', 'FBI', 'must', 'move', 'forward', 'plans', 'succeed.But', 'world', 'thieves', 'where', 'code', 'honor', 'placed', 'not', 'parties', 'can', 'be', 'trusted', 'Not', 'Russians', 'not', 'Romanovs', 'not', 'police', 'not', 'Gabriel', 'especially', 'not', 'Ripley.The', 'story', 'moves', 'along', 'steady', 'pace', 'giving', 'necessary', 'information', 'keep', 'up', 'speed', 'plans', 'plot', 'romance', 'here', ""n't"", 'interfere', 'story', 'actually', 'set', 'up', 'characters', 'affections', 'later.Some', 'may', 'claim', 'storyline', 'portions', 'seem', 'lifted', 'other', 'films', 'familiar', 'fact', 'when', 'heist', 'films', 'little', 'differentiate', 'one', 'exception', 'acting', 'pacing', 'are', 'commendable', 'film.Freeman', 'great', 'job', 'wizened', 'pro', 'who', 'ropes', 'how', 'steer', 'clear', 'prison', 'sentence', 'Banderas', 'along', 'ride', 'be', 'enjoying', 'Ripley', 'tricks', 'own', 'way', 'actors', 'play', 'well', 'one', 'coming', 'off', 'co-conspirators', 'rather', 'settling', 'old', 'passing', 'torch', 'mentality', 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'films', 'characters', 'different', 'ages.The', 'film', 'entertaining', 'evening', 'should', 'choose', 'rent', 'fans', 'actors', 'worth', 'adding', 'collection', 'proof', 'positive', 'ca', ""n't"", 'judge', 'DVD', 'based', 'popularity', 'film', 'prior', 'release', 'First', 'Look', 'Pictures', 'done', 'great', 'job', 'one', 'hope', 'continue', 'do', 'so', 'future']",The Code

They put the same shirt on Banderas as Douglas, and a sexier more revealing dress on Mitchell - both grinding to some rave music. A very similar scene from Entrapment but Banderas instead of Zeta-Jones, and the list continues. There are also some mad Russians, ego-driven Federal officers, and rebellious NYPD hot shots filling the supporting ranks. What makes this watchable is wondering where the twists might come in and seeing if they can pull off the impossible heist.The Blu clarity looks great at times, average in various other indoor scenes. The music makes the 5.1 get utilized the most, and the supplements add a dry logistical feel to the rest.

1167644,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B001AR011A,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","""The Code"" (aka ""Thick as Thieves"") stars Morgan Freeman and Antonio Banderas, plus two of my favorite actors Robert Forster and Radha Mitchell. And somehow this heist movie went straight to DVD in America. This is no surprise after all, as the film (directed by Mimi Leder, ""Deep Impact"") suffers from unfocused story, pedestrian direction and the least interesting and one-dimensional characters.A veteran art thief Keith Ripley (Freeman) recruits a younger (and daring) crook Gabriel Martin (Banderas) after witnessing the latter pull off a robbery in NYC subway. Keith, who must repay his debt to a gangster, has been planning his final heist: stealing two Faberg&eacute; eggs worth $ 40 million from a museum. Things get complicated when Gabriel meets Alexandra Korolenko (Mitchell), a goddaughter of Keith and daughter of a murdered Russian mobster. Gabriel tries to seduce her despite her godfather's warning to leave her alone.The story is almost clich&eacute; with those familiar types of characters, and not in the delightful way. The heist itself is uninteresting, lacking the details of the situation the characters must go through. The obligatory romance only slows down the action. A few twists and turns are thrown in, which I admit are unpredictable, but they only help make the whole confusing storyline more incomprehensible.""The Code"" looks as if concocted from the mediocre episodes of a caper TV show.

1167645,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B001AR011A,Z Hayes,"[40, 46]","The only reason I picked this movie up [as a rental] was because of Morgan Freeman, an actor I've always respected and admired. The fact that Antonio Banderas plays opposite him also intrigued me, and then there's the beautiful Radha Mitchell. So, the idea of these three together in a movie kind of made it an appealing choice, though I have to say I was disappointed with the results.The movie is a standard heist film - Antonio Banderas plays Gabriel aka Gaby, an armed bandit who encounters Morgan Freeman's character, Ripley whilst pulling off a robbery on a subway train. Ripley sees potential in the relatively younger Gaby and persuades him to join him in a heist at the famous Romanov's Jewelers. The objects of desire are two prized Faberge eggs whose existence have never been officially acknowledged but which Ripley assures Gaby are very much in existence and priceless [well, about 40 million]. Anyway, as Gaby agrees to be Ripley's sidekick, he finds himself falling for Ripley's Russian goddaughter [played by Radha Mitchell]. Things get more complicated when a detective resentful of not being able to convict Ripley for his past heists starts putting the heat on the pair, despite being warned off by the Feds [who are investigating the Russian jewelers]. When Radha Mitchell's character gets kidnapped, Ripley and Gaby are forced to race against time to pull off the heist of a lifetime with some interesting plot twists along the way.What worked for me - the acting was credible on the whole, despite the unimaginative and at times, implausible plot. There is no genuine chemistry between Freeman and Banderas, and the pairing seems awkward. The story itself is uninspired - there have been so many other heist movies that were much better than this, and so I felt let down by the writing and the direction.What does work is the chemistry between Banderas and Mitchell. Radha Mitchell is a very attractive actress and she pulls off her role convincingly, playing a rather enigmatic character who seems to know more than she is letting on. The pair sizzle on-screen which helps the romance part of the movie,which happens to be another focus in this film. The heist part of the movie is rather weak, though the action picks up when Ripley and Gaby finally break into the jewelers, though once again, there is nothing new here.On the whole, I'd recommend this as a rental at best - like I mentioned earlier, there are much better heist movies out there and ""The Code"" does not bring anything new to the table.",3,Good talent put to waste in a been-there-done-that heist movie,1245888000,"06 25, 2009",2009,2527,"['only', 'reason', 'picked', 'movie', 'up', '[', 'rental', ']', 'was', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'actor', ""'ve"", 'always', 'respected', 'admired', 'fact', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'opposite', 'also', 'intrigued', 'then', 'beautiful', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'So', 'idea', 'three', 'together', 'movie', 'kind', 'made', 'appealing', 'choice', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'disappointed', 'results.The', 'movie', 'standard', 'heist', 'film', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'Gabriel', 'aka', 'Gaby', 'armed', 'bandit', 'who', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'character', 'Ripley', 'whilst', 'pulling', 'off', 'robbery', 'subway', 'train', 'Ripley', 'potential', 'relatively', 'younger', 'Gaby', 'join', 'heist', 'famous', 'Romanov', 'Jewelers', 'objects', 'desire', 'are', 'two', 'prized', 'Faberge', 'eggs', 'existence', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'officially', 'acknowledged', 'Ripley', 'Gaby', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'existence', 'priceless', '[', 'well', '40', 'million', ']', 'Anyway', 'Gaby', 'be', 'Ripley', 'sidekick', 'falling', 'Ripley', 'Russian', 'goddaughter', '[', 'played', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', ']', 'Things', 'get', 'more', 'complicated', 'when', 'detective', 'resentful', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'convict', 'Ripley', 'past', 'heists', 'putting', 'heat', 'pair', 'being', 'warned', 'off', 'Feds', '[', 'who', 'are', 'investigating', 'Russian', 'jewelers', ']', 'When', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'character', 'kidnapped', 'Ripley', 'Gaby', 'are', 'forced', 'race', 'time', 'pull', 'off', 'heist', 'lifetime', 'interesting', 'plot', 'twists', 'worked', 'acting', 'was', 'credible', 'whole', 'unimaginative', 'times', 'implausible', 'plot', 'genuine', 'chemistry', 'Freeman', 'Banderas', 'pairing', 'awkward', 'story', 'uninspired', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'heist', 'movies', 'were', 'much', 'better', 'so', 'felt', 'let', 'down', 'writing', 'direction.What', 'work', 'chemistry', 'Banderas', 'Mitchell', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'very', 'attractive', 'actress', 'role', 'convincingly', 'playing', 'rather', 'enigmatic', 'character', 'who', 'know', 'more', 'letting', 'pair', 'sizzle', 'on-screen', 'romance', 'part', 'movie', 'be', 'focus', 'film', 'heist', 'part', 'movie', 'rather', 'weak', 'action', 'up', 'when', 'Ripley', 'Gaby', 'finally', 'break', 'jewelers', 'though', 'once', 'again', 'nothing', 'new', 'here.On', 'whole', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'rental', 'best', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'heist', 'movies', 'there', 'Code', 'not', 'bring', 'anything', 'new', 'table']",The Code
