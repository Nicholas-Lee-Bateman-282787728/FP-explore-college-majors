There was a very valid reason the griping began the moment Ms. Lohan was announced as being cast for the role - she is simply NOT RIGHT FOR THE ROLE!!! There should have been a talent search for an unknown who was more physically and facially appropriate. The ONLY thing this ""movie"" got right was the placement of Taylor's beauty mark. As Martha said in ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"", ""...sad, sad, sad."" Undoubtedly THE low point for Lifetime! A true and total trainwreck that does NOTHING to give the viewer even the remotest idea of who Elizabeth Taylor was.

Lohan is known as a mediocre actress, who squandered what little talent she had by her obsurd and childish lifestyle choices.This could have been a fantastic movie, but the choice of cast was so far off the mark it became laughable.

1634826,AD50CYPEWH6NN,B00BI6SRVY,Jon Wynne,"[0, 0]","As something of a Richard Burton scholar and the author of a play called &#8220;Dick & Liz&#8221; (believe it or not), I approached this film with trepidation. And yet, like most people who find the story of the Burtons&#8217; love affair so intriguing, I couldn&#8217;t wait. It turns out LIZ & DICK isn&#8217;t as bad as many people make it out to be.There is no denying that Lindsay Lohan is inspired casting as Elizabeth Taylor. But no one stands a chance when compared to Elizabeth Taylor in her prime when she was one of the world&#8217;s great beauties and arguably the finest film actress of her generation. Were she somehow able to play Ms Taylor without being compared to her&#8211;only the distance afforded by time, perhaps, would allow for this&#8211; Ms Lohan might&#8217;ve come off better.Ms Lohan plays sex well, though arguably sex is different from being sexy (and Elizabeth Taylor was definitely sexy). For example, about half the film is taken up with kissing and, luscious as Lindsay Lohan is, her sullied reputation conveys a person less in love and more going through the motions of intimacy. She never gets to the heart of Elizabeth Taylor (who certainly equated sex with love) though many of the essential ingredients are on display: vulnerability, childishness, vanity, etc. As a result, the emotional scenes never portray the passion they should. If the premise of LIZ & DICK is to tell one of the world&#8217;s great love stories, then we need access to the feelings and passions of the protagonists. Instead of being told Burton and Taylor are in love, we should be shown it. Going through the motions of intimacy, or jealousy, or quarreling isn&#8217;t convincing enough.The production design is the real star of this biopic. The jewellery (essential in a film about Elizabeth Taylor) looks real, the sets are lavish, sometimes opulent, and the clothes, though sometimes ridiculous (oh, the seventies!) are right on the money.Grant Bowler is very good as Richard Burton, though claims that his voice captures Burton&#8217;s timbre are highly exaggerated. Bowler conveys the essence of Burton, however: the insecure coal miner&#8217;s son who never got over the death of his mother. His relationship with older brother Ifor is explored reasonably well, though the lifeline Ifor represented to Burton isn&#8217;t fully examined. Bowler is a better actor than Lohan, which is problematic, given that Elizabeth Taylor arguably had the stronger personality. If not, she at least had the power, for Burton was constantly afraid she would leave him&#8211;which she eventually did. Here it is clear Ms Lohan is the star, but she is simply acting opposite someone who is better than her, which serves to undermine whatever star power she may have.The real problem with LIZ & DICK though, is the script, which moves from climax to climax with such haste that it becomes comical towards the end. If this great love story is going to have the effect it is supposed to have on an audience then we must be made to feel the tragedy of it all. Trying to cover too much ground makes the story superficial, ultimately. Without the roots of character and psychology firmly planted, we simply can&#8217;t respond with the emotional investment tragedy requires from an audience. To truly plumb the depths of tragedy and sorrow and move beyond the shallowness of tabloid fantasy is the greatest challenge in telling this tale. People of privilege who live a life of riches beyond the imaginings of most of us must be seen to fall mightily if we are going to feel sympathy for them and thus deem their suffering tragic. It is sometimes a very fine line between catharsis (a purging of emotion as we respond with fear and pity) and comeuppance.Make no mistake, this is a tragic tale, but mainly for reasons not explored here. Richard Burton was destroyed by Elizabeth Taylor. LIZ & DICK ignores that truth and tries to persuade us that Elizabeth&#8217;s suffering was the real tragedy here. We are told she kept Burton&#8217;s letters to her to the end of her life. Sorry, that is sentiment, not tragedy. Burton&#8217;s downfall and early death is a tragedy.LIZ & DICK isn&#8217;t as bad as some say, but it could&#8217;ve been a lot better. For fans of Liz and Dick, there&#8217;s still plenty to enjoy. Just don&#8217;t expect, well, Liz and Dick.",3,Not as bad as one might think.,1397433600,"04 14, 2014",2014,4356,"['something', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'scholar', 'author', 'play', 'called', '8220', 'Dick', 'Liz', '8221', 'believe', 'not', 'approached', 'film', 'trepidation', 'yet', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'find', 'story', 'Burtons', '8217', 'affair', 'so', 'intriguing', 'couldn', '8217', 'wait', 'out', 'LIZ', 'DICK', 'isn', '8217', 'as', 'bad', 'many', 'people', 'make', 'denying', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'inspired', 'casting', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'one', 'chance', 'when', 'compared', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'prime', 'when', 'was', 'one', 'world', '8217', 'great', 'beauties', 'arguably', 'finest', 'film', 'actress', 'generation', 'Were', 'somehow', 'able', 'play', 'Ms', 'Taylor', 'being', 'compared', '8211', 'only', 'distance', 'afforded', 'time', 'perhaps', 'would', 'allow', '8211', 'Ms', 'Lohan', 'might', '8217', 'come', 'off', 'better.Ms', 'Lohan', 'sex', 'well', 'arguably', 'sex', 'different', 'being', 'sexy', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'was', 'definitely', 'sexy', 'example', 'film', 'taken', 'up', 'kissing', 'luscious', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'sullied', 'reputation', 'conveys', 'person', 'less', 'love', 'more', 'going', 'motions', 'intimacy', 'never', 'heart', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'who', 'certainly', 'equated', 'sex', 'love', 'many', 'essential', 'ingredients', 'are', 'display', 'vulnerability', 'childishness', 'vanity', 'etc', 'result', 'emotional', 'scenes', 'never', 'portray', 'passion', 'should', 'premise', 'LIZ', 'DICK', 'tell', 'one', 'world', '8217', 'great', 'love', 'stories', 'then', 'need', 'access', 'feelings', 'passions', 'protagonists', 'Instead', 'being', 'told', 'Burton', 'Taylor', 'are', 'love', 'should', 'be', 'shown', 'Going', 'motions', 'intimacy', 'jealousy', 'quarreling', 'isn', '8217', 'convincing', 'enough.The', 'production', 'design', 'real', 'star', 'biopic', 'jewellery', 'essential', 'film', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'real', 'sets', 'are', 'lavish', 'sometimes', 'opulent', 'clothes', 'sometimes', 'ridiculous', 'oh', 'seventies', 'are', 'right', 'money.Grant', 'Bowler', 'very', 'good', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'claims', 'voice', 'captures', 'Burton', '8217', 'are', 'highly', 'exaggerated', 'Bowler', 'conveys', 'essence', 'Burton', 'however', 'insecure', 'coal', 'miner', '8217', 'son', 'who', 'never', 'got', 'death', 'mother', 'relationship', 'older', 'brother', 'Ifor', 'explored', 'reasonably', 'well', 'lifeline', 'Ifor', 'represented', 'Burton', 'isn', '8217', 'fully', 'examined', 'Bowler', 'better', 'actor', 'Lohan', 'problematic', 'given', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'arguably', 'had', 'stronger', 'personality', 'not', 'least', 'had', 'power', 'Burton', 'was', 'constantly', 'afraid', 'would', 'leave', '8211', 'eventually', 'did', 'Here', 'clear', 'Ms', 'Lohan', 'star', 'simply', 'acting', 'opposite', 'someone', 'who', 'better', 'undermine', 'star', 'power', 'may', 'have.The', 'real', 'problem', 'LIZ', 'DICK', 'script', 'climax', 'climax', 'such', 'haste', 'comical', 'end', 'great', 'love', 'story', 'going', 'have', 'effect', 'supposed', 'have', 'audience', 'then', 'must', 'be', 'made', 'feel', 'tragedy', 'Trying', 'cover', 'too', 'much', 'ground', 'story', 'superficial', 'ultimately', 'roots', 'character', 'psychology', 'firmly', 'planted', 'simply', 'can', '8217', 'respond', 'emotional', 'investment', 'tragedy', 'audience', 'truly', 'plumb', 'depths', 'tragedy', 'sorrow', 'move', 'shallowness', 'tabloid', 'fantasy', 'greatest', 'challenge', 'telling', 'tale', 'People', 'privilege', 'who', 'live', 'life', 'riches', 'imaginings', 'most', 'must', 'be', 'seen', 'fall', 'mightily', 'are', 'going', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'thus', 'deem', 'suffering', 'tragic', 'sometimes', 'very', 'fine', 'line', 'catharsis', 'purging', 'emotion', 'respond', 'fear', 'pity', 'comeuppance.Make', 'mistake', 'tragic', 'tale', 'mainly', 'reasons', 'not', 'explored', 'here', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'was', 'destroyed', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'LIZ', 'DICK', 'truth', 'tries', 'persuade', 'Elizabeth', '8217', 'suffering', 'was', 'real', 'tragedy', 'here', 'are', 'told', 'kept', 'Burton', '8217', 's', 'letters', 'end', 'life', 'Sorry', 'sentiment', 'not', 'tragedy', 'Burton', '8217', 'downfall', 'early', 'death', 'tragedy.LIZ', 'DICK', 'isn', '8217', 'as', 'bad', 'say', 'could', '8217', 've', 'been', 'lot', 'better', 'fans', 'Liz', 'Dick', '8217', 'still', 'plenty', 'enjoy', 'Just', 'don', '8217', 'expect', 'well', 'Liz', 'Dick']",Liz & Dick

Some parts of it appear a little unbelievable. It's difficult to think Burton was so in awe of Taylor at their first meeting he continually fluffed his lines. There's no build-up to their attraction...one day they apparently hate each other, the next they're so madly in love they use each break to head to a trailer for some afternoon (or morning or mid-day) delight. There's no transition from one to the other. I was hoping for scenes showing the making of specific movies the two were in, as well as their interaction with others in the casts, etc.. Instead there were merely various scenes of lovemaking and fights, break-ups and reconciliations. Perhaps that's the way the screenwriters saw their lives together, or perhaps they didn't want to make this a 3-hour epic, or...perhaps they merely had to choose what to portray and this is the result.
