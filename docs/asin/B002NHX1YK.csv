I just wish the video ""Pancho Barnes"" with Valerie Bertinelli was on DVD too.  I think Kim Stanley in ""The Right Stuff""  had a better grasp on how Pancho acted.  Though Bertinelli had no idea how to pro tray Pancho because Pancho really could get her own way at times, and she much louder than life it self.

1279841,AM1672DGAV2TY,B002NHX1YK,Theo J.,"[2, 2]","Nick Spark's excellent documentary was wonderful viewing for me personally , because I first met Pancho at an airshow/fundraiser in 1972. I'd just been out flying open-cockpit with a buddy, and (Gods' truth) introduced myself to her wearing a leather flight jacket and carrying my helmet and goggles. She looked me up and down, cocked an eyebrow, and said precisely nothing. Unpromising as that beginning was, I became friendly with her son Bill and his wife Shoulang. Pancho wasn't in good health then, and her energies were intermittent; but I'd read a transcipt of Don Kuhns' taped interview with Pancho (featured on this DVD), and had a healthy respect for what she'd accomplished in her life. I was also glad to see her honored as a guest at a major aviation function (Pancho in silver-lame evening wear was a sight to behold, surrounded by friends who regarded with a respect which she richly deserved). She was an amazing woman, and I'm glad to see her place in aviation history so well acknowledged.",5,"Pancho Barnes: A Tough, Tender, Surprising Legend",1297209600,"02 9, 2011",2011,1007,"['Nick', 'Spark', 'excellent', 'documentary', 'was', 'wonderful', 'viewing', 'personally', 'first', 'met', 'Pancho', 'airshow/fundraiser', '1972', ""'d"", 'just', 'been', 'out', 'flying', 'open-cockpit', 'buddy', 'Gods', 'truth', 'introduced', 'wearing', 'leather', 'flight', 'jacket', 'carrying', 'helmet', 'goggles', 'looked', 'down', 'cocked', 'eyebrow', 'said', 'precisely', 'nothing', 'Unpromising', 'beginning', 'was', 'became', 'friendly', 'son', 'Bill', 'wife', 'Shoulang', 'Pancho', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'health', 'then', 'energies', 'were', 'intermittent', ""'d"", 'read', 'transcipt', 'Don', 'Kuhns', 'taped', 'interview', 'Pancho', 'featured', 'DVD', 'had', 'healthy', 'respect', 'what', ""'d"", 'accomplished', 'life', 'was', 'also', 'glad', 'see', 'honored', 'guest', 'major', 'aviation', 'function', 'Pancho', 'silver-lame', 'evening', 'wear', 'was', 'sight', 'behold', 'surrounded', 'friends', 'who', 'regarded', 'respect', 'richly', 'deserved', 'was', 'amazing', 'woman', ""'m"", 'glad', 'see', 'place', 'aviation', 'history', 'so', 'well', 'acknowledged']",N/A
