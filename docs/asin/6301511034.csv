254444,A35L2AGZXN37CE,6301511034,"Alexander Duval ""Admirer of Good Films""","[3, 3]","This film is probably one of the better ones for the 1970s and certainly the performance of Art Carney is worthy of an Academy Award.  I am not trying to take anything away from the other nominees for 1974, but the late Mr. Carney deserved the Oscar for his memorable performance.  I remember the 1970s well and this film brought back many personal memories.  The film has a superb cast including Ellen Burtsyn (one of my favorite actresses) and there was the character actor Arthur Hunnicutt who brought a special flavor to the film.  The devotion of Harry to his cat Tonto and their adventures are heartwearming.  While the ending is sad in itself, it is also one that gives the film a touch of genuine reality. Carney's acting ability is clearly evident in this film and I would recommend it to any one who appreciates seeing a son;s devotion to his aging father; and of a person's love for their pet.  There are too many memorable scenes to talk about here, but in total, Harry and Tonto represents, to me at least, filmmaking at its best.",5,A Superb Film Worth Seeing Over,1093392000,"08 25, 2004",2004,1043,"['film', 'probably', 'one', 'better', 'ones', '1970s', 'certainly', 'performance', 'Art', 'Carney', 'worthy', 'Academy', 'Award', 'am', 'not', 'trying', 'take', 'anything', 'away', 'other', 'nominees', '1974', 'late', 'Mr.', 'Carney', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'memorable', 'performance', 'remember', '1970s', 'well', 'film', 'brought', 'back', 'many', 'personal', 'memories', 'film', 'superb', 'cast', 'including', 'Ellen', 'Burtsyn', 'one', 'favorite', 'actresses', 'was', 'character', 'actor', 'Arthur', 'Hunnicutt', 'who', 'brought', 'special', 'flavor', 'film', 'devotion', 'Harry', 'cat', 'Tonto', 'adventures', 'are', 'heartwearming', 'ending', 'sad', 'also', 'one', 'film', 'touch', 'genuine', 'reality', 'Carney', 'acting', 'ability', 'clearly', 'evident', 'film', 'would', 'recommend', 'one', 'who', 'seeing', 'son', 'devotion', 'aging', 'father', 'person', 'love', 'pet', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'talk', 'here', 'total', 'Harry', 'Tonto', 'least', 'filmmaking', 'best']",N/A
254445,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6301511034,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 6]","Let me start by being completely honest with you.  Art Carney does a very fine job in the title role as Harry Coombes.  He's effectively warm and tender in his scenes, layering the `at times rather annoying' Harry with enough human realness that he becomes a genuine person and not just a hollow caricature.  That said, no matter how good he was, he was no where near the brilliance that was Al Pacino or Jack Nicholson.  Honestly, how he was nominated let alone crowned the victor in the 1974 Oscar race is far beyond me to comprehend.  It's madness to even suggest that this merely `good' performance is even on the same level as Pacino or Nicholson's masterclass work.That said; I will do my best to review this film without any prejudice whatsoever.Harry Coombes is a retired schoolteacher who has just recently been evicted from his apartment.  He moves into his son's home along with his dear cat Tonto.  When living under the rules of another grow tiresome for Harry he decides to up and leave, traveling cross-country with his cat to see his daughter.  He has an eventful journey indeed, and in the end he seems to find a small part of himself he thought was lost forever.It's a sweet story and it's told rather well, but in the end it is really nothing more than that; a sweet story.  Carney does some nice work, keeping Harry believable (although at times rather ridiculous) despite his obnoxious tendencies.  His refusal to conform to modern society is an outward statement about the fall of society in general, a world that has no respect for those who came before us.  It's written well, although it could have been written better.It reminds me a lot of `The Trip to Bountiful' except that movie actually managed to develop it's points rather soundly.In the end the film is a good film that could have been a great one had the script been a little more intuitive.  It seems that the film kind of carries a predictable calculated relaying of events.  As `interesting' as some of Harry's encounters may seem, they never feel as `interesting' as we are to believe they are.  They all feel rehearsed and even average; expected almost.  When Harry is arrested for peeing on the outside wall of a building it doesn't have the tinge of fresh humor it was going for.  It feels rather expected and kind of leaves a `been-there-done-that' feel in the back of your mouth.  Carney elevates the film in areas and helps keep us interested, but in the end this movie does little more than entertain.It's no where near and poignant as it wants to be.So, with all prejudice aside I say that this is a B- kind of movie.  It is sweet and adequately executed, but it is no where near the best in anything, and Carney, while effective, is not even nomination worthy here.  There is a list of at least ten names that come before him for me, six of which weren't even nominated.",4,"It's sweet, but that's about it...",1229299200,"12 15, 2008",2008,2868,"['Let', 'start', 'being', 'completely', 'honest', 'Art', 'Carney', 'very', 'fine', 'job', 'title', 'role', 'Harry', 'Coombes', 'effectively', 'warm', 'tender', 'scenes', 'layering', 'times', 'rather', 'annoying', 'Harry', 'enough', 'human', 'realness', 'genuine', 'person', 'not', 'just', 'hollow', 'caricature', 'said', 'matter', 'how', 'good', 'was', 'was', 'where', 'brilliance', 'was', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Honestly', 'how', 'was', 'nominated', 'let', 'alone', 'crowned', 'victor', '1974', 'Oscar', 'race', 'far', 'comprehend', 'madness', 'even', 'suggest', 'merely', 'good', 'performance', 'even', 'same', 'level', 'Pacino', 'Nicholson', 'masterclass', 'work.That', 'said', 'will', 'do', 'best', 'review', 'film', 'prejudice', 'whatsoever.Harry', 'Coombes', 'retired', 'schoolteacher', 'who', 'just', 'recently', 'been', 'evicted', 'apartment', 'son', 'home', 'dear', 'cat', 'Tonto', 'When', 'living', 'rules', 'grow', 'tiresome', 'Harry', 'up', 'leave', 'traveling', 'cross-country', 'cat', 'see', 'daughter', 'eventful', 'journey', 'indeed', 'end', 'find', 'small', 'part', 'thought', 'was', 'lost', 'forever.It', 'sweet', 'story', 'told', 'rather', 'well', 'end', 'really', 'nothing', 'more', 'sweet', 'story', 'Carney', 'nice', 'work', 'keeping', 'Harry', 'believable', 'times', 'rather', 'ridiculous', 'obnoxious', 'tendencies', 'refusal', 'conform', 'modern', 'society', 'outward', 'statement', 'fall', 'society', 'general', 'world', 'respect', 'who', 'came', 'written', 'well', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'better.It', 'reminds', 'lot', 'Trip', 'Bountiful', 'movie', 'actually', 'managed', 'develop', 'points', 'rather', 'soundly.In', 'end', 'film', 'good', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'one', 'had', 'script', 'been', 'little', 'more', 'intuitive', 'film', 'kind', 'predictable', 'calculated', 'relaying', 'events', 'interesting', 'Harry', 'encounters', 'may', 'seem', 'never', 'feel', 'interesting', 'are', 'believe', 'are', 'feel', 'rehearsed', 'even', 'average', 'expected', 'almost', 'When', 'Harry', 'arrested', 'peeing', 'outside', 'wall', 'building', ""n't"", 'have', 'tinge', 'fresh', 'humor', 'was', 'going', 'rather', 'expected', 'kind', 'been-there-done-that', 'feel', 'back', 'mouth', 'Carney', 'film', 'areas', 'keep', 'interested', 'end', 'movie', 'little', 'more', 'entertain.It', 'where', 'near', 'poignant', 'be.So', 'prejudice', 'aside', 'say', 'B-', 'kind', 'movie', 'sweet', 'adequately', 'executed', 'where', 'best', 'anything', 'Carney', 'effective', 'not', 'even', 'nomination', 'worthy', 'here', 'list', 'least', 'ten', 'names', 'come', 'six', 'were', ""n't"", 'even', 'nominated']",N/A

The film revels in the eccentricities of our fellow-humans and the ways in which their quirks enrich our lives.There are few, if any, weak links to the cast. The performances of veteran director, Herbert Berghof, Ellen Burstyn, Geraldine Fitzgerald, Josh Mostel and Chief Dan George are dead, solid perfect.Carney delivers an understated performance that captured the 1974 Oscar for Best Actor.  In the final moments of the film, Harry --aat the end of his journey -- sees a vision of the past on a California beach.At the instant he stops running, completely winded, and accedes to life as it is, he triggers a catharsis I found unforgettable.Eye-catching cinematography, a durable,  moving score  by Bill Conti and thoughtful art direction enhance the trip futher.A lovely film, capably remastered, and a steal at this price.",5,Harry's Turn,1128124800,"10 1, 2005",2005,1271,"['1974', 'jewel', 'addressed', 'deepening', 'loneliness', 'elders', 'country', 'role', 'animals', 'other', 'strangers', 'play', 'sustaining', 'loss', 'displacement.Harry', 'Tonto', 'John', 'Steinbeck', 'Charley', 'embarking', 'final', 'journey', 'discover', 'America', 'characters', 'prefer', 'share', 'deepest', 'insights', 'four-legged', 'creatures', 'humanity', 'Mazursky', 'characters', 'make', 'movie', 'shimmer', 'film', 'revels', 'eccentricities', 'fellow-humans', 'ways', 'quirks', 'are', 'few', 'weak', 'links', 'cast', 'performances', 'veteran', 'director', 'Herbert', 'Berghof', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'Geraldine', 'Fitzgerald', 'Josh', 'Mostel', 'Chief', 'Dan', 'George', 'are', 'dead', 'solid', 'perfect.Carney', 'delivers', 'understated', 'performance', 'captured', '1974', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Actor', 'final', 'moments', 'film', 'Harry', 'aat', 'end', 'journey', 'vision', 'past', 'California', 'beach.At', 'instant', 'running', 'completely', 'winded', 'accedes', 'life', 'catharsis', 'found', 'unforgettable.Eye-catching', 'cinematography', 'durable', 'moving', 'score', 'Bill', 'Conti', 'thoughtful', 'art', 'direction', 'trip', 'futher.A', 'lovely', 'film', 'capably', 'remastered', 'steal', 'price']",N/A

254450,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,6301511034,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[15, 17]","Well, I'll agree Art Carney was certainly the unlikely Oscar winner in 1975 for his role as gallivanting, cat toting septuagenarian Harry Coombes in the film Harry and Tonto (1974), especially given his competition including Jack Nicholson (Chinatown), Al Pacino (The Godfather: Part II), Dustin Hoffman (Lenny), and Albert Finney (Murder on the Orient Express), but that shouldn't overshadow the fact that this is just a really wonderful film, one worth checking out.  Produced, co-written, and directed by Paul Mazursky (Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice, Down and Out in Beverly Hills), the film stars, as I mentioned, Art Carney (W.W. and the Dixie Dancekings, Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood), probably best know for his role of Ed Norton, the world's most famous sewer worker, on the 1950s series ""The Honeymooners"".  Also appearing is Philip Bruns (The Great Waldo Pepper), Cliff De Young (F/X), Josh Mostel (City Slickers), Geraldine Fitzgerald (Wuthering Heights), Melanie Mayron (My Blue Heaven), Chief Dan George (The Outlaw Josey Wales), Larry Hagman (""I Dream of Jeannie""), and Ellen Burstyn (The Exorcist), who won an Oscar for another film she appeared in released the same year titled Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore.Carney plays Harry Coombes, a widowed, 72 year old retired teacher who's recently found out that he and his orange tabby named Tonto, are soon to be among the homeless throngs as their NY apartment building is slated for destruction, to be replaced by a parking lot.  Harry reluctantly moves in with his son Burt (Bruns) in his suburban home, but quickly realizes living with a group isn't his (or Tonto's) bag.  Harry begins looking for a new place in the city, but it's difficult, especially when you've got a cat in tow.  After the death of a close friend, Harry decides to do a little traveling and spend time with his two, other children, one of whom named Shirley (Burstyn) lives in Chicago, and the other named Eddie (Hagman) who lives in California.  After problems not only at the airport and subsequently on the bus, Harry and Tonto find themselves on foot somewhere between the moon and New York City, eventually buying a car, picking up a couple of hitchhikers (the scripture quoting hitchhiker soon finds another ride, thank God, as he's headed south rather than west), one of them a runaway named Ginger (Mayron), who manages to convince Harry to look up an old flame (Fitzgerald) along the way (it's not like Harry or Ginger are in that big of a hurry to get anywhere in particular).  The trio do make it to Chicago and see Harry's daughter, but they're soon on their way again, with Harry's grandson Norman (Mostel) along for the ride (Norman was sent from NY to collect his grandfather, but ends up sort of hooking up with Ginger).  After some interesting encounters (a vitamin salesman, a benevolent prostitute, and an honest to goodness Native American medicine man), Harry and Tonto finally make it out west, learning the journey can often times be more enjoyable than the destination.Here's one of my favorite lines from the film...it comes from an elderly landlady of a shoddy NYC apartment building as Harry, who's looking for a new place, comments on the limited view...""At our age, if you don't know what the world looks like, you never will.""  Everyone's a comedian...I like how she just walked in on the tenant still living in the apartment to show it (apparently, he was moving out at the end of the week).  You know what's strange?  I've never seen anyone walking a cat (as they would a dog, with a leash), until I saw this film.  This is a fairly sweet, mellow, sometimes sad film that flows along at a amiable pace, taking its' time in the telling.  Carney, who was in his mid 50s at the time, is really wonderful as Harry, an educated man (he's always got a line of Shakespeare handy), and devoted cat owner, always with a song in his heart, just beginning to explore the opportunities now in front of him, some of which he traded off on many years past in choosing to settle down and raise a family.  One of my favorite elements of the character is, despite the time spent in the Big Apple (he'd been mugged four times that year), he displays a willingness to open himself up to the experience of traveling the country by the seat of his pants with his furry companion, meeting new and interesting people, and seeing the world outside of a major, metropolitan city.  He does seem a little nave at times, but I think it's more of him just leaving his preconceptions behind and his willingness to want to understand how the rest of the world lives.  As far as the rest of the performances, they were all very well done, doing exactly what they should have, supporting Carney's role.  I thought Harry's children interesting...there's Burt, the sort of clingy, overly concerned son, Shirley, the independent daughter who seems to have inherited her father's intelligence as well as his stubbornness, and finally Eddie (Hagman), the seemingly well-to-do Hollywood schmoozer who puts up a good, but transparent faade (he's broke as the day is long).  As I said, the story moves along pretty well, and I hardly even realized nearly two hours had passed by the time it was over.  I was really engaged in the characters and relationships, along with the bits of humor and drama.  There are a couple of poignant moments in the film, but they're never milked as they would have been in other films, and for that I was impressed and thankful.  They were relatively short, sweet, and appropriate, and kept the film well away from the realm of schmaltzy sentimentality.The picture, presented in anamorphic widescreen (1.85:1), looks clean and comes across well, as do the audio tracks, available in both Dolby Digital mono (English and Spanish) and stereo (English only).  There's a commentary track with producer, co-writer, and director Paul Mazursky, along with a theatrical teaser, a theatrical trailer, and three television spots, and English and Spanish subtitles.Cookieman108By the way, not only did Mazursky produce, co-write, and direct this film, but he also appeared in a bit part credited as the `Gay Hustler'.  Watch for his scene in the last third of the film, as Harry's at a bus terminal in L.A. waiting for his son Eddie to pick him up.  One last thing, if this film taught me anything it's that people sure loved the Raymond Burr television series ""Ironsides"" back in the day.",5,"""I'll tell you something Harry, I don't always like

254451,A39CX0EE4BZCZC,6301511034,Craig Connell,"[1, 1]","Every once in a while - but less and less these days - a movie comes around that has some impact, in that you find it hard to get it out your mind for awhile. That's what ""Harry and Tonto"" did to me, recently.It wasn't the world's greatest film but it was great storytelling, sometimes a lost art among filmmakers in recent decades. ""Harry"" is a retiree and ""Tonto"" is his cat. The movie follows the two around as the pair travel from the East Coast to the West. It all begins when Harry's building is demolished as part of ""urban renewal."" He quickly finds out he doesn't want to live with his quirky son and his even-stranger kids, so he hits the road to Chicago to seek out other relatives. It goes from there.The movie is filled with little vignettes. For instance, how the cat adapts or doesn't adapt to some modes of travel and the interesting and very diverse people Harry meets on the way (which winds up going all the way to Los Angeles).Art Carney as ""Harry Coombes"" got the Academy Award for best actor.

Excellent transfer of an marvelous film.Evicted (literally carried) from his New York apartment, Harry Coombes (Carney) and Tonto, his cat, undergo a series of encounters that move them slowly, inevitably west. Harry stays briefly with each of his three children, and reinforced by casting choices, we feel that we're moving backward in time, eldest to youngest. Harry, too, seems to move backward in time. Through a series of other encounters - an Indian healer, a young girl running away from home, and others - Harry sheds his past, piece by piece, and moves toward an open future in which anything might happen.There are memorable character portraits by Ellen Burstyn, Larry Hagman, Arthur Hunnicutt, Chief Dan George, and others. And of course Harry, whose acceptance of loss and refusal to indulge in sentimentality or self-pity show us it is possible to age with dignity and suppleness. This is a gem of a movie, from a time when Hollywood was not afraid to tell real stories about real people.Would someone, PLEASE, release this on DVD!?

254454,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,6301511034,David Baldwin,"[1, 1]","""Harry and Tonto"" is an engaging film but I view it as something of a missed opportunity.  Director Paul Mazursky opens the film with a montage of the downtrodden elderly of New York City.  It's starts out swimmingly by introducing us to Harry(Art Carney) and his elderly friends who congregate on a park bench regaling about their past glories.  It's when the film leaves New York and becomes a road movie where I think it loses it's way.  Certainly there are some amusing vignettes but they don't say much.  An example would be a scene where a drunken Harry is arrested in Las Vegas for urinating on a casino wall.  The only real purpose for this is to put him in a jail cell with a colorful Indian medicine man played by Chief Dan George.  A slight chuckle but so what.  The main reason to see the film is the towering performance by Carney.  Carney imbues Harry with dignity and a self deprecation that helps protect him from the slings and arrows life throws at him.  If you want to see Carney even better check out Robert Benton's ""The Late Show"".  It's apples and oranges whether Carney should have beat Al Pacino for the Oscar in 1974.

254462,A1W661TC1P6VQI,6301511034,"Kevin T. Rodriguez ""The Movie Wizard.com Revi...","[4, 4]","""Harry & Tonto"" is unlike any movie you are going to see. I know, people say that a lot, but this is one of the few times that statement is true. This movie was made in 1974, but it feels more fresh today then most of the movies released in 2002. Rarely is there a time when odd-ball comedies work, and even rarer are the times they work on a deeper level then you expect them to. ""Harry & Tonto"" is such a film that starts out as, of all things, a road trip movie, but ends with an examination of the human soul. The movie revolves around Harry Coombes (Art Carney in an Oscar winning role), a lonely man whose wife has died and children moved away. Harry lives a quiet life in his apartment with his best friend, an orange tabby cat named Tonto. This is the life Harry lives until he is forced out of his apartment, which is set to be torn down and turned into a parking lot.Harry's son invites him to stay with his family, but a few days living with his sons family shows that they are crowded enough as it is. Sizing up the situation, Harry grabs Tonto and the two set out on a trip across the country. On bus, through hitchhiking, and even by foot, these two make their way from one town to another, not really sure where they will end up but determined to savor the journey. As you might expect, Harry runs into several eccentric people along his way, but they are not as stereotypical as they might sound. There's an Indian doctor, a hooker, a teenager who ran away from home, characters that are all ripe to be used as colorful cliches, and yet the movie gives these characters real feelings and real personalities. Harry talks with these people and gives them fatherly advice, while admitting that he's not sure whether his advice fits in with the world anymore.In one brilliant scene, Harry is talking with a run away teenager. The teenager shares her problems and Harry muses ""I guess I just don't know what it's like to be a teenager these days."" The girl looks at him, looks out the window and replies ""neither do I."" I never expected a movie about an old man and his cat to be so deep in it's conversations. The acting is universally excellent. People discuss their hopes, dreams, and fears with such delegacy that you get to know them as people, not characters. One great conversation between Harry and his best friend involves both of them talking about their past, how much the world has changed, and how much do they really have left to live for. A few days later Harry's friend dies, and in Harry's face you can see that a piece of who he is has gone with him.But this is not a downer of a movie by any means. In fact, this is a very uplifting movie in many regards. There are regrets in life, and there are things we are not proud of, but does life ever truly end? Getting thrown out of his apartment was the best thing to happen to Harry. That stupid lady at the airport who wouldn't let Tonto on the plane was also a blessing, because had the two flown to their destination then they would have missed the journey. As Harry makes this journey he discovers that even though he is 72 years old, there is still plenty of life out there to live and many sights to be seen. I guess I should make a note that Harry's relationship with Tonto is no mere gimmick, as there is a real bond there that comes with being together for many years.

Harry was forced to change, and the journey with all its adventures gave him a second chance.  Harry and Tonto was released in 1974, but still plays well as a comedy-drama.  Harry Golden (played well by Art Carney) is a 72 year old widower who has to leave his Manhattan apartment because the building is being leveled.  The demolition ball is ready to make the first strike as Harry is carried out in his favorite chair, holding Tonto close.  He does not like change so he is the last one out of the building. His oldest son takes him in, but by the end of the film Harry has visited all three of his grown children, and then decides to that he is happier taking care of himselfAs Harry and Tonto proceed on the erratic road trip, they get off a bus and hitchhike, buy an old car, enjoy detours and decide to go to the West Coast, after visiting his daughter in Chicago.  Harry realizes he will never be happy living with someone else.The oddball  characters Harry and Tonto meet on this adventure are up-beat and each give Harry a lesson or help along the way.  Harry's road trip helps him relive old memories of where he has been and where he is going. He visits a lost love in a nursing home, he sees how his children have made their lot in life, he also meets a hooker from Las Vegas and a Indian Chief/Medicine man who shares a jail cell with him.

254467,ABE8YHLYSM15G,6301511034,Luke Killion,"[1, 1]","""Harry and Tonto"" is quirky road movie from 1974. Art Carney plays the lead as Harry Coombes, costaring with his feline sidekick Tonto. When I first heard the premise of this movie, I thought the idea seemed very eccentric, even a bit audacious. But the acting of Carney makes the duo a relatable and poignant tale of growing old in an era of radical change within young America. Carney is doing a bit of a Peter Pan routine with this old man, whose willingness to experiment in his golden year creates the subtle humor which drives this tale.One of the perspectives that director Paul Mazursky brings here is the bond between the youth movement of the hippy generation and a young at heart jazz age grandpa who is forced out of his home in New York City due to a gentrification project that was typical of that era. Coombes comes across as a bit of a curmudgeon at first, in part due to the urban decay of his neighborhood and his typical old man ""in my day"" type of attitude. As the story progresses, Coombes does reveal that he and his late wife were ""liberated before it was in fashion"", but he is very grounded, if only a tad bit eccentric.The most obvious statement that comes to mind here is the mentality of the older generation that observed the hippies and their defiant and often bizarre ways. It was often said in the 60' and 70's that ""no one over 30 was to be trusted"". Mazursky's stance as a director is so amazing here because of his centrist viewpoint in the union between the old and the young. Coombes does not change all that dramatically in this film; his easy going yet proper demeanor brings him into contact with all kinds of strangers he meets on the road, and for the most part this is a carefree story. I did consider this film going to a dark place, in that an elderly and somewhat disoriented man travels cross country with his cat on a leash, but like most of Mazursky's work in this era, he flirts with danger without dwelling on it to seriously. This movie did not go into the strange water that ""Scarecrow"" did the year before, a similar hippy road movie, but one that ends with a committal to a mental hospital.Carney is obviously the glue that makes this film stick, but the ensemble cast is very strong. Joshua Mostel plays one of Harry's grandsons who has taken a ""vow of silence"" (along with mind altering drugs), Melanie Mayron is Ginger, a run away who plans on heading to a Colorado commune and Ellen Burstyn also has a cameo as a friend. Larry Hagman, one of the costars the 1970's and 80's hit show ""Dallas"" (who just passed away in the last week) also has a small role as Harry's second son, Eddie. This is one of those magic films that really clicks on all levels. Carney beat out an impressive roster for Best Actor at the 1974 Academy Awards. This film may be a bit hard to find, but it is a 70's classic and well worth a watch.",5,Young at heart 70's road flick,1354320000,"12 1, 2012",2012,2875,"['Harry', 'Tonto', 'quirky', 'road', 'movie', '1974', 'Art', 'Carney', 'lead', 'Harry', 'Coombes', 'costaring', 'feline', 'sidekick', 'Tonto', 'When', 'first', 'heard', 'premise', 'movie', 'thought', 'idea', 'seemed', 'very', 'eccentric', 'even', 'bit', 'audacious', 'acting', 'Carney', 'duo', 'relatable', 'poignant', 'tale', 'growing', 'old', 'era', 'radical', 'change', 'young', 'America', 'Carney', 'doing', 'bit', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'routine', 'old', 'man', 'willingness', 'experiment', 'golden', 'year', 'subtle', 'humor', 'tale.One', 'perspectives', 'director', 'Paul', 'Mazursky', 'here', 'bond', 'youth', 'movement', 'hippy', 'generation', 'young', 'heart', 'jazz', 'age', 'grandpa', 'who', 'forced', 'home', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'due', 'gentrification', 'project', 'was', 'typical', 'era', 'Coombes', 'across', 'bit', 'curmudgeon', 'first', 'part', 'due', 'urban', 'decay', 'neighborhood', 'typical', 'old', 'man', 'day', 'type', 'attitude', 'story', 'Coombes', 'reveal', 'late', 'wife', 'were', 'liberated', 'was', 'fashion', 'very', 'grounded', 'only', 'tad', 'bit', 'most', 'obvious', 'statement', 'mind', 'here', 'mentality', 'older', 'generation', 'observed', 'hippies', 'defiant', 'often', 'bizarre', 'ways', 'was', 'often', 'said', '60', '70', 'one', '30', 'was', 'be', 'trusted', 'Mazursky', 'stance', 'director', 'so', 'amazing', 'here', 'centrist', 'viewpoint', 'union', 'old', 'young', 'Coombes', 'not', 'change', 'dramatically', 'film', 'easy', 'going', 'yet', 'proper', 'demeanor', 'contact', 'kinds', 'strangers', 'road', 'most', 'part', 'carefree', 'story', 'did', 'consider', 'film', 'going', 'dark', 'place', 'elderly', 'somewhat', 'disoriented', 'man', 'travels', 'cross', 'country', 'cat', 'leash', 'most', 'Mazursky', 'work', 'era', 'danger', 'dwelling', 'seriously', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'go', 'strange', 'water', 'Scarecrow', 'did', 'year', 'before', 'similar', 'hippy', 'road', 'movie', 'one', 'committal', 'mental', 'hospital.Carney', 'obviously', 'glue', 'film', 'stick', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'very', 'strong', 'Joshua', 'Mostel', 'one', 'Harry', 'grandsons', 'who', 'taken', 'vow', 'silence', 'mind', 'altering', 'drugs', 'Melanie', 'Mayron', 'Ginger', 'run', 'away', 'who', 'heading', 'Colorado', 'commune', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'also', 'cameo', 'friend', 'Larry', 'Hagman', 'one', 'costars', '1970', '80', 'hit', 'show', 'Dallas', 'who', 'just', 'passed', 'away', 'last', 'week', 'also', 'small', 'role', 'Harry', 'second', 'son', 'Eddie', 'one', 'magic', 'films', 'really', 'levels', 'Carney', 'beat', 'out', 'impressive', 'roster', 'Best', 'Actor', '1974', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'hard', 'find', '70', 'classic', 'well', 'watch']",N/A

I promptly ordered the video, watched the movie for the first time last night, and wow! it was so sad it ripped my heart out!  It's a great movie, with an outstanding performance by Art Carney (yes, I do think he deserved the Oscar).  The thing that most prompted me to get it was the fact that I love cats.  If you love cats, I guarantee you'll love this movie, but I also guarantee you'll cry at the end.  You'll also feel sorry for Carney's character, an old man who feels he's lost all his old friends and doesn't know his place in the world.  He sets out with his cat Tonto trying to find roots, and along the way he meets some strange characters.  That's one thing that makes the movie interesting.  This movie also took me back to the 1970's and made me realize that life was actually simpler then, when we didn't have the Internet, cell phones, and computerized cars.  Watching the movie will give you a feeling of nostalgia (if you can remember the 70's), as well as humor, sadness, and sympathy.

254469,A2R6RA8FRBS608,6301511034,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[2, 2]","Harry and Tonto is an excellent film that tells the story of how an old man takes his cat Tonto with him on an impromptu trip across the country. The cinematography and choreography are very well done and the musical score enhances the film, too. The acting is very convincing and although the movie is almost two hours long I was never once bored; instead I felt a constant interest in what would happen next to the old man and his cat. Although this could have been syrupy sweet and very saccharine, the excellent acting, especially by Art Carney, saves the film from this fate.When the film starts we meet Harry Coombes (Art Carney, who won an Oscar for this role) who is being forced out of his apartment in what has become a run-down neighborhood in Manhattan; he refuses to look for another place to live even though the building is being torn down and he has been mugged four times in just the past year! When the police finally have to carry Harry out of the building in his easy chair so they can demolish it and build a parking lot, Harry's son Burt (Philip Bruns) takes him to live with his family. Although Harry and Burt's family try their best to make a go of it, it's not long before Harry wants to move on to Chicago where his daughter Shirley Mallard (Ellen Burstyn) lives; perhaps Harry and Tonto can live with her for a while.Of course, there's much more to the story than what I've just told you. Harry winds up taking the bus to Chicago instead of using the plane ticket his son Burt bought for him; and when Harry's cat Tonto has to relieve himself and the bus cannot wait by the road any longer Harry's adventure becomes more complicated yet much more colorful and meaningful as well. We see exactly how Harry and his cat eventually make the journey to Los Angeles; he meets up with quite a cast of characters on his way there to see and possibly live near his other son Eddie (Larry Hagman).In essence, the film shows how Harry meets new friends and, at times, has to say a sad good bye to old friends.Look for excellent performances by Josh Mostel as Harry's nephew Norman; and Herbert Berghof does a great job of portraying Harry's friend Jacob Rivetowski back in Manhattan before Harry is evicted from his home. Melanie Mayron plays Ginger, a young run away from home who wants to live in a commune. Geraldine Fitzgerald has a cameo as Jessie Stone, an old love interest from Harry's past.The DVD comes with a few extras including an optional running commentary and three TV spots as well as the theatrical trailer.I recommend this movie for anyone who enjoys sentimental yet understated dramas with some comedy thrown in for a great effect.

Like Woody Allen, Larry David, Jerry Seinfeld, Billy Crystal, and many others, Mazursky has that brilliant spark of biting Jewish, New York, cynical humor which you either love or hate (I absolutely love it). Why so many great Jewish comics? One very salient theory is that the Jews have been persecuted so much over the centuries that they've had to laugh to keep from crying. It's like the little kid with glasses who gets picked on; he lacks the physical strength to beat the bully so he relies on humor.Anyway, I loved this movie back when it first came out. It deals with topics which, in our youth-crazy US culture, are anathema to filmmakers and filmgoers: old age and end-of-life issues (however, I do have a feeling that as the ranks of boomers swell, the interest in this subject will increase). It's a quirky, ""road"" movie that is full of wonderfully interesting characters and scenes. No other reviewer has mentioned the great ""banana"" scene at the beginning of the film. I haven't seen this movie in 20 years, but this scene is still memorable to me. Harry stops in to see his grocer, an old Jewish guy (I am going by memory here, so bear with me). The grocer tells him about his even-older brother, who was still having sex regularly at 80+ years of age. Next scene shows Harry walking down the street....munching on a banana. Very funny.Then there is the final, magical scene at the California beach, and I would love to hear the details of how this happened. Whether it was spontaneous or planned, it remains for me one of the most poignant and magnificent movie scenes I have ever had the pleasure of seeing. Harry and the cat are down by the water, near a little girl who is intently playing in the sand. The wind is blowing, the waves are crashing, and the cat, as cats will do, prances up to the little girl and briefly rubs against her. She looks up at Harry and playfully sticks her tongue out at him and smiles. And that is it. Simply fantastic. Absolutely perfect.We're all getting older, kids. Sooner or later we will find ourselves, for better or worse, more able to relate to Harry's situation. When he made this film, Art Carney was about six years younger than I am right now, so yes, I have already begun to get the AARP mailings, cemetary plot adverts, retirement seminar invitations, etc.. However, I plan to go out kicking and screaming, just like Harry. Well, maybe not kicking and screaming, but I sure as h*ll don't plan to take up golf, square dancing, cards and shuffleboard.",4,The Golden Years,1300752000,"03 22, 2011",2011,2730,"['probably', 'Paul', 'Mazursky', 'greatest', 'film', 'am', 'glad', 'see', 'Mr.', 'Mazursky', 'still', 'may', 'have', 'seen', 'recently', 'episode', 'Curb', 'Your', 'Enthusiasm', 'one', 'funniest', 'sit-coms', 'all-time', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Larry', 'David', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'many', 'others', 'Mazursky', 'brilliant', 'spark', 'biting', 'Jewish', 'New', 'York', 'cynical', 'humor', 'either', 'love', 'hate', 'absolutely', 'love', 'Why', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'Jewish', 'comics', 'One', 'very', 'salient', 'theory', 'Jews', 'have', 'been', 'persecuted', 'so', 'much', 'centuries', ""'ve"", 'had', 'laugh', 'keep', 'crying', 'little', 'kid', 'glasses', 'who', 'picked', 'physical', 'strength', 'beat', 'bully', 'humor.Anyway', 'loved', 'movie', 'back', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'topics', 'youth-crazy', 'US', 'culture', 'are', 'anathema', 'filmmakers', 'filmgoers', 'old', 'age', 'end-of-life', 'issues', 'however', 'do', 'have', 'feeling', 'ranks', 'boomers', 'swell', 'interest', 'subject', 'will', 'increase', 'quirky', 'road', 'movie', 'full', 'wonderfully', 'interesting', 'characters', 'scenes', 'other', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'great', 'banana', 'scene', 'beginning', 'film', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', '20', 'years', 'scene', 'still', 'memorable', 'Harry', 'see', 'grocer', 'old', 'Jewish', 'guy', 'am', 'going', 'memory', 'here', 'so', 'bear', 'grocer', 'even-older', 'brother', 'who', 'was', 'still', 'having', 'sex', 'regularly', '80+', 'years', 'age', 'Next', 'scene', 'shows', 'Harry', 'walking', 'down', 'street', '.munching', 'banana', 'Very', 'funny.Then', 'final', 'magical', 'scene', 'California', 'beach', 'would', 'love', 'hear', 'details', 'how', 'happened', 'was', 'spontaneous', 'planned', 'one', 'most', 'poignant', 'magnificent', 'movie', 'scenes', 'have', 'ever', 'had', 'pleasure', 'seeing', 'Harry', 'cat', 'are', 'down', 'water', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'intently', 'playing', 'sand', 'wind', 'blowing', 'waves', 'are', 'crashing', 'cat', 'cats', 'will', 'do', 'prances', 'up', 'little', 'girl', 'briefly', 'rubs', 'up', 'Harry', 'playfully', 'tongue', 'out', 'smiles', 'Simply', 'fantastic', 'Absolutely', 'perfect.We', ""'re"", 'getting', 'older', 'kids', 'Sooner', 'later', 'will', 'find', 'better', 'worse', 'more', 'able', 'relate', 'Harry', 'situation', 'When', 'made', 'film', 'Art', 'Carney', 'was', 'six', 'years', 'younger', 'am', 'right', 'now', 'so', 'yes', 'have', 'already', 'begun', 'get', 'AARP', 'mailings', 'cemetary', 'plot', 'adverts', 'retirement', 'seminar', 'invitations', 'etc..', 'However', 'plan', 'go', 'out', 'kicking', 'screaming', 'just', 'Harry', 'Well', 'maybe', 'not', 'kicking', 'screaming', 'sure', 'h*ll', 'do', ""n't"", 'plan', 'take', 'up', 'golf', 'square', 'dancing', 'cards', 'shuffleboard']",N/A
254472,A24GLNOGCWICTP,6301511034,Neil Cotiaux,"[0, 0]","Here's a bittersweet drama-comedy that's every bit as relevant today as it was when it first hit theaters in the 70's - perhaps even more so given the huge Baby Boomer population passing into their so-called ""Golden Years"".Art Carney portrays Harry Coombes, a retired widower and former professor in New York City who's still full of vinegar. Harry fills his marital void by doting on his cat, Tonto, by engaging in park bench musings with a Left Bank-style intellectual and by staging a sit-in in his condemned apartment building. Carried out of his home still ensconced in his easy chair, little does Harry know that this single act of forced separation will liberate him from family tensions and daily rituals and allow him to experience the kind of self-definition and spiritual renewal so necessary in the final years of life.Moving east to west, from greyness and personal ambiguity to increased confidence and sunshine, Harry begins to shed, by both design and happenstance, the emotional straightjacket that might have engulfed him like so many other New Yorkers at his age. (The opening sequence of the film is a touching, vivid portrayal of real-life Manhattanites that eerily reminded me of the sights, smells and temperature of the late fall days that I had personally experienced in Gotham as I was growing up.) A rapid-fire ensemble of ""characters"" - including a pre-Viagra-obsessed used car salesman, a ""Jesus freak"", a convertible-driving hooker, flim-flam artist and latter-day Medicine Man - allows Harry to let go, live more in the moment and enjoy the serendipity of finding new acquaintances who, if they do not supplant, then at least evoke the fond memories of loved ones who have departed his life permanently.The closing scene of this poignant, humorous film has been described as a let-down by some and as a cliche by others. I disagree. Whether director Mazursky knew it or not, his beach scene is an alternative version of one of the final shots in Fellini's masterpiece ""La Dolce Vita"" where the protagonist ambles upon a young girl that he once knew in happier times, makes brief eye contact, and then moves on in a vacuum. Harry does no such thing. He stays put, embracing the moment - and his future - with newfound confidence.With ""Harry and Tonto"", Art Carney again demonstrated the terrific breadth of his talents, first demonstrated when he was paired with Jackie Gleason in the early 50's teledrama ""The Laugh Maker"", then progressing through the antics of ""The Honeymooners"" to his Broadway stint as Felix in ""The Odd Couple"".

254473,A15LK8DSFQZZ52,6301511034,"Patricia R. Andersen ""redheaded booklover""","[3, 7]","I like Art Carney and I like orange cats, so this combination should be a clear winner for me. But it's note. The basic story is a retired schoolteacher gets evicted from his home due to urban renewal and visits with each of his 3 children. Art Carney does a wonderful job, _but_ the actor playing the older son looks old enough to be Art Carney's dad. Maybe it's just me, but while Mr Carney's acting was flawless, he did not move like a 77 year old man. As a matter of fact, I expected him to break out in a huge song and dance scene any time during the movie.Now the cat, Tonto, is great. He is the most mellow cat I have ever seen on my life and I've been owned by a very mellow cat. The carrying around, the walking on the harness, the interactions between Carney and Tonto were beautiful. In fact, Tonto's interaction with everybody was sweet and beautiful.But WHY, WHY, WHY did Tonto have to die? He was 11 which is really not that old for a cat. There were no leading up to it, just ""Tonto doesn't look well"" and the next thing you know, Tonto is in a cage at the shelter, you know he is going to be ""put down"" and ""Harry"" is saying goodbye. Mr Carney does not pull off this particular scene very well. And it made me think ""If you got a thousand bucks to give to your deadbeat younger son, you couldn't have spent a little on a vet?"" I'm not saying pets are more important than people - just that if you have the money to spare, be a responsible pet owner and do right by your pet. Tonto's death did not advance the storyline or make any difference in ""Harry"" or his life. What this a cheap trick to yank tears out of the moviegoers' eyes? The movie could have ended at the chess scene, before Tonto was noted to be ill and I would have happily gave this movie 4 stars. But I feel somehow cheated out of what could have been a happy ending.The last little bit to me makes me wonder what it was supposed to represent. Were we seeing Harry's death and his meeting with Tonto? Or were we just seeing a ""77 year old man"" chase after a cat? I tend to believe it was Harry's death, simply because the movie already inserted the downer of Tonto's death.But you may like this movie much better than I do. Having gone through a lot of loss (loved ones - 2 legged and 4 legged), I just wanted it to end with Harry and Tonto settled in one place, just relaxing. My advice would be to skip this movie, but your mileage may vary.",1,Spoiler Alert!

I think now that the film requires the audience to just accept it for what it is. Its a wonderful story about an aging man who experiences some changes in his life and decides to be as optimistic as possible and simply go with the flow, enjoy life, and go where ever it might take him. The character Art Carney plays lives a simple life. An average life. But his optimism and free spirited attitude toward adventure takes him on a cross country trip where he simply takes each day as it comes. What he experiences doesnt reflect some dramatic excitement and major life affirming changes. But what it does offer him is more of a connection with people that enriches him and creates a balanced harmony in his life. It makes him a happier human being. There is a little sadness here and there, but he also learns that the simple things in life are what make it beautiful. So with his cat Tonto beside him he goes where ever the road leads, and he has some memorable experiences along the way. Theres a few great cameos here, and Ellen Burstyn is one of the real treats of the movie. I have loved her since seeing her in The Exorcist. I Also loved the care free life affirning mood of this film. It remembers a simpler time and reminds us of the joy that can be found in the simplest of events. And Carneys performce is simply beautifully done. He truly deserved his Oscar. Harry Koons is a lovable old koot, and I wish I knew some elderly people like him.

What can you do if your best friend, who promised to take you in, then up &amp; dies? What can you do if you are then taken in by your son and his family who pretend that they want you but, all the while, you know in your gut that you are an absolute burden to them? What can you do if your only true friend is yourself--and your cat? Would you have the courage to uproot yourself for the first time in your life and to discover new places, new experiences and yourself?Such is the predicament of Harry Coombes (Art Carney, in his Oscar-winning performance), who sets out in search of a new, better life after the old, comfortable existence he always knew is unceremoniously cast by the wayside. In his quest across America, which takes him from New York City to Southern California, he occasionally hooks up with family members--his neurotic son Burt (Philip Bruns) and his dysfunctional family, cold-hearted daughter Shirley in Chicago (a well-cast Ellen Burstyn, who won her much-deserved Best Actress Oscar in the same year for Martin Scorsese's ALICE DOESN'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE) and philandering son Eddie (an earnest Larry Hagman)--but it's his experiences with others such as hippy chick Ginger (Melanie Mayron), Native American healer Sam Two Feathers (an unforgettable Chief Dan George) and possible new love interest Celia (Sally Marr) that truly guide him to his destination; perhaps his destiny.Also memorable is the earlier-mentioned dysfunctional family of eldest son Burt, consisting of wife Elaine (Dolly Jonah) and their two grown sons, the ingrate Burt Jr. (Cliff De Young) and the weird, silent Norman (Josh Mostel, in the second significant role of his career). One of the most touching scenes in HARRY AND TONTO is the brief reunion of Harry with his old flame Jessie (a radiant Geraldine Fitzgerald). Their scene together in which they dance to their old memories is one of the greatest in all of cinema.Art Carney's performance as the 72-year-old Harry Coombes is so incredibly natural that you don't realize that Art was, in fact, only 56 at the time. You also forget all about him having played Ed Norton for all those years in the 1950's on the classic TV sitcom &quot;The Honeymooners.&quot; HARRY AND TONTO may not be the most exciting film from 1974, but it is has the most human interest.

Literally carried out in his recliner kicking and shouting, Harry comes to live with the oldest of his three adult children and his family.  But it's clear that the arrangement is not working out--his son's family appears to be having problems and Harry senses that he's a burden on them.  So he then takes off to the Windy City to try living with his independent daughter (Ellen Burstyn, who, incidentally, won the year's Best Actress Oscar for ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"").  But that doesn't work out, either, as Harry and Shirley (the daughter in question) don't see eye to eye on anything.  So he takes off once again (with his grandson and Ginger, a teenage hitch hiker Harry picks up, along for the ride) and heads for the west coast where his youngest one (Larry Hagman, four years after ""I Dream of Jeannie"" and four years before ""Dallas"") lives.  By the time he gets to California, he realizes that he likes where he is and doesn't wish to go back home.At first glance, ""Harry and Tonto"" is simply a movie about a man who travels the country with his pet cat.  That's certainly true--Harry and Tonto go everywhere together, but it's about more than that.  The movie is about people, specifically the ones Harry meets on his cross-country journey.  There's the aforementioned Ginger, a 16-year-old hitch hiker who's just run away from home; Jacob, Harry's cynical Polish friend (who dies just before Harry leaves New York); Leroy, Harry's janitor friend who's having a hard time finding a job and still lives with his mother; the Bible-quoting hitch hiker who Harry picks up when he first meets Ginger; Jessie, Harry's ex-girlfriend (they dance together during a very touching scene); the vitamin salesperson whose health remedies have questionable cures; Stephanie, a prostitute who picks up Harry and shows him that he isn't too old to have sex; the elderly Native American shaman who cures Harry of his bursitis using an ancient chant (Harry meets him in jail after he's arrested for urinating in public); and a friendly woman with a large cat family who offers Harry use of her spare room after he arrives in L.A., plus all the other people in between.  All together, they make Harry's journey--and life--interesting.  This is exactly the kind of movie director Paul Mazursky made: interesting, because that's what life is when you meet many kinds of people.

His constant companion is his cat, Tonto.Along the way, we meet Harry's friends, his grown kids, his grandsons, assorted oddballs, etc.This is a story that is more about the journey than the destination, as is the case with most American road trip movies.  Harry is nearing the end of his days but is still full of life.  He tries to stay in his apt. even when the city wants the building torn down, he defends his cat against the airport security and bus regulations, and he gets along with all sorts of people without judging them.There is no reason for the R rating on this film, by the way.

254479,A3T46X7M3AUDAB,6301511034,William Timothy Lukeman,"[0, 0]","When Art Carney won the Oscar for Best Actor, there were some who chalked it up to sentimentality. Don't you believe it! He delivers a superb performance that's anything but sentimental. There's genuine warmth, to be sure; but Harry is still irascible, hungry for life & experience, passionate in his friendships & memories & loyalties. And in an era when so many young people were going on the road to discover America & themselves, it's a special treat to see an older man doing the same -- a man whose spirit is younger than that of his own children, in fact. The supporting cast is excellent, down to the smallest roles -- and Melanie Mayron is particularly sweet & honest as the teenaged runaway who becomes his traveling companion for a time -- but this is Art Carney's show, from first to last. We see him not only as paterfamilias, but as friend, lover, philosopher, wayfarer. In crossing all of America, from East to West, he's still eager for new possibilities as he comes to the shores of the Pacific Ocean in the twilight, the end of the American frontier ... but not the end of his exploration, both inward & outward. I can't understand why this film isn't as well-known as it should be, except that beautifully written & acted character studies aren't popular in a world of GCI action fests these days. And more's the pity! Its a film that remains rich & deeply rewarding over many viewings; and the commentary track by director Paul Mazursky is all that a good commentary should be -- informative, personal, intelligent..
