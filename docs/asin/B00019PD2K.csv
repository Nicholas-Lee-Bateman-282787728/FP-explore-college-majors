797096,A2UMN0G7MUC1U,B00019PD2K,theadman95,"[15, 16]","This could and should have been easily a 5 star review.  The music is just plain wonderful, and the performers, for the most part (there are a couple of minor exceptions) sound nearly as good as they did 30 years ago.  A lot of vibrancy, and the band(s) were uniformly tight and enthusiastic.  A wonderful musical experience.HOWEVER, my copy of the DVD (which they may have fixed by now), had a VERY annoying mismatch between the sound and the visuals.  That is, the performers lip and mouth movements were never in sync with what you were hearing - always a delay or lag.  I mean, c'mon people...  I thought that this sort of thing went out with 1950's public service cafeteria school films.  In this digital day and age, there is simply NO EXCUSE for this.  It's pure laziness or sloppiness for something that should have been easily fixed prior to letting the DVD go out.  I'm sorry, but I have to take points off for this, as it detracts from the viewing experience.That said, again, the music is wonderful.  After having evacuated New Orleans for Katrina, I am now living in Memphis, and happy to be in what I view as the 2nd most important American city for music.  This DVD gives a good argument for that.  By the way, the DVD puts in a plug for the STAX records museum here (the DVD is actually a tribute to STAX, filmed at the Orpheum Theater in Memphis).  The museum is worth seeing, and contains 2 items that thrilled me:  the actual Hammond Organ that Booker T used to record ""Green Onions"", and the actual Wah-Wah pedal used on the intro to Isaac Haye's ""Shaft"".  These are like holy relics to me, and there are many more.  Memphis also has several other music related museums, etc.If you don't mind the performer's mouths not matching the sound, you'll love this Dvd!",3,"Great Music, BUT",1139529600,"02 10, 2006",2006,1781,"['could', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'easily', '5', 'star', 'review', 'music', 'just', 'plain', 'wonderful', 'performers', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'couple', 'minor', 'exceptions', 'sound', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'did', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'lot', 'vibrancy', 'band', 'were', 'uniformly', 'tight', 'enthusiastic', 'wonderful', 'musical', 'experience.HOWEVER', 'copy', 'DVD', 'may', 'have', 'fixed', 'now', 'had', 'VERY', 'annoying', 'mismatch', 'sound', 'visuals', 'performers', 'lip', 'mouth', 'movements', 'were', 'never', 'sync', 'what', 'were', 'hearing', 'always', 'delay', 'lag', 'mean', ""c'mon"", 'people', 'thought', 'sort', 'thing', 'went', '1950', 'public', 'service', 'cafeteria', 'school', 'films', 'digital', 'day', 'age', 'simply', 'NO', 'EXCUSE', 'pure', 'laziness', 'sloppiness', 'something', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'easily', 'fixed', 'prior', 'letting', 'DVD', 'go', 'out', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'have', 'take', 'points', 'off', 'viewing', 'experience.That', 'said', 'again', 'music', 'wonderful', 'having', 'evacuated', 'New', 'Orleans', 'Katrina', 'am', 'now', 'living', 'Memphis', 'happy', 'be', 'what', 'view', '2nd', 'most', 'important', 'American', 'city', 'music', 'DVD', 'good', 'argument', 'way', 'DVD', 'plug', 'STAX', 'records', 'museum', 'here', 'DVD', 'actually', 'tribute', 'STAX', 'filmed', 'Orpheum', 'Theater', 'Memphis', 'museum', 'worth', 'seeing', '2', 'items', 'thrilled', 'actual', 'Hammond', 'Organ', 'Booker', 'T', 'used', 'record', 'Green', 'Onions', 'actual', 'Wah-Wah', 'pedal', 'used', 'intro', 'Isaac', 'Haye', 'Shaft', 'are', 'holy', 'relics', 'are', 'many', 'more', 'Memphis', 'also', 'several', 'other', 'music', 'related', 'museums', 'etc.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'performer', 'mouths', 'not', 'matching', 'sound', ""'ll"", 'love', 'Dvd']",Soul Comes Home: A Celebration of Stax Records and Memphis Soul Music
