932586,A3Q04XXGGED746,B000AS4L16,"Jan Peczkis ""Scholar and Thinker""","[21, 52]","This newly-reissued work includes interviews with Jewish sonderkommando survivors of Auschwitz, Polish peasants, Jan Karski (the legendary Polish Underground courier who vainly tried to warn the world about the Holocaust), Holocaust historian Raul Hillberg, a German official at Treblinka, and others.Lanzmann should have examined fewer topics, and done so more thoroughly and objectively. He used only 9.5 hours out of 350 hours of taping, making one wonder what he left out. Intentionally or not, his work comes across as anti-Polish. Students of the Holocaust deserve better, and I now provide some context, a few of the necessary corrections, and books for further study from solely Jewish sources. From there, read my reviews. [I originally provided direct links. These, for some reason, have been removed by Amazon's software. So I have replaced the ellipses with the titles of the books themselves.]The Polish peasants interviewed by Lanzmann exhibit a ""Jews owned everything"" mindset. In fact, there were many wealthy Jews and, even with the formal and informal discriminatory policies enacted to reverse Jewish economic dominance, the average Jew remained wealthier than the average Pole. See: SOCIAL AND POLITICAL HISTORY OF THE JEWS IN POLAND, 1919-1939.  In Poland, most peasants lived in poverty, and were stuck in it because the next-higher economic niche (the shopkeepers, tailors, shoemakers, etc.) was largely pre-occupied by Jews. This (rather than simple prejudice against, or jealousy, of Jewish successes) explains frequent Polish peasant resentments against Jews. Also, the employer-employee, seller-buyer, and lender-borrower relations are partly adversarial in nature. When there are different ethno-religious groups on each side of the divide, this will naturally generate friction between groups.One interviewed German tries to relativize German conduct. In fact, despite the fact that anti-Semitism existed in countless nations since time immemorial, it was only in Germany (Haman excepted) that it ever developed into a never-before-seen effort to exterminate the Jews. Also, the sources and course of anti-Jewish policies in pre-Nazi and Nazi Germany, and those in prewar Poland, were entirely different. See: THE JEWISH WAR FRONT.Poles are portrayed as generally laughing at Jewish deaths, and mocking Jews with the you-will-die gesture. Against both misrepresentations, see: AM I A MURDERER? TESTAMENT OF A JEWISH GHETTO POLICEMAN.As for the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, the conduct of the Polish Blue Police is incorrectly conflated with that of the collaborationist Ukrainian police. For the truth, see: MARTYRS AND FIGHTERS (by Friedman). Also, mention is made of some Poles turning-in Jews who had fled after the Uprising, but not the circumstances behind it. Besides imposing the automatic death penalty for the slightest assistance to individual Jews, the Germans had created draconian collective terror against the Polish population of Warsaw for any semblance of assistance to, or connection with, the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. Some Poles made life-or-death decisions to turn Jews in rather than risk large groups of Poles shot by the Germans in reprisal for the Germans killed by Jews during the Uprising. See: MURANOWSKA 7: THE WARSAW GHETTO RISING.Finally, Lanzmann's analysis is so Judeocentric that it is completely sanitized of any reference to Polish suffering. Did you know that Poles lived in daily fear of their lives, under near-starvation conditions, during the German occupation? Did you know that 3 million Polish gentiles (including about half of all educated Poles) were murdered by the Germans?

Lithuanians, Germans, Polish, etc., all involved in the camps in some way or another. Guards, train drivers, farmers around the camps. He goes to the places and does many interviews right there. He leaves no stone unturned. He deals with every detail imaginable about transport to the camp, the happenings in the camps, the terrible sufferings and cold brutal treatment. He is very hard on the Germans but what he covers is a terrible thing. There is one major dynamic he misses. That is the spiritual dynamic. He makes no mention of the evil etiology of the whole matter, that is utterly satanic. He takes a humanist social ethos position. While most of the people systematically murdered were Jews, Lanzmann's main focus, there were also many political enemies of the state and Christians also murdered.It should be born in mind that most Germans, fighting for the Wehrmacht, were not hard Nazis but just drafted. In general they were patriots, fighting for Germany. The officer class was often not at all sympathetic to the situation of the camps. How much they knew or thought about the camps varied. They had all they could handle obviously. Of course, Lanzmann is dealing solely with the camps.He keeps asking or implying how could you do this. Why?

932592,A24O54AMGXLFOB,B000AS4L16,Paul Wiener,"[2, 5]","Shoah is a great film, and an important one, not to be missed. But it's not a good one. I watched it over a 4-month period, mostly in 2-hours stints. It's over 9-1/2 hours long. Claude Lanzmann intended for the viewer to see it in one sitting, perhaps with a short intermission.The average viewer won't recognize it as a film - a movie - at all, but as a document, which is what it really is - a document that's not only a testament to the horror, cruelty, inhumanity and suffering perpetrated on the Jews by the Germans and Poles in World War 2, but a testament to Lanzmann's perseverance, anger, discipline, fearlessness, energy and sense of justice. Yet all that doesn't necessarily make a film that's very watchable or even effective as a purge or as an education. Lanzmann chose very deliberately NOT to include archival footage in his film - of which an enormous amount exists: footage of the starved and doomed and dead and dying, and of their oppressors, where they lived, how they were tortured, marched, transported, rotted in the streets. Instead, his film comprises interviews with survivors, Nazi soldiers and administrators, endless interviews by people who look normal, sane, even healthy, witnesses, and of the empty concentration camp fields, towns, villages, forests, railroads, factories, cities, and rooms that remained (as of 1985, when it was released to universal acclaim, and during the many preceding years of research, filming, travel, editing, and planning) after the Holocaust was over. If it was ever over. In my opinion this intellectual or aeshetic approach to telling the story was a poor one, and fails to horrify the viewer. And horror is the only proper response. Shoah merely fascinates, outrages, pains and infuriates. But in my opinion only an up close and personal recreation of the worst horrors that are recounted and are well-documented by thousands of historians, the Nazis themselves, artists, and survivors could come close to reminding. We need to be scarrred the way a brand, a tattoo might do - future viewers have to feel in their blood what human beings were once - and still are - capable of doing to others in the name of ideology, bureaucracy, politics, government, righteousness, race and what Amitav Ghosh calls supremacism. Blood should run from the screen. That aside, Lanzmann's film hypnotizes the attentive viewer with information and memories - and the absence of both - much of which come from the mouths and faces of the people who made or saw or felt it happen. What was it like for mothers and sons and fathers and brothers to watch their kin be tortured and murdered and walk naked to their deaths? Shoah can only  make you imagine: it does not traffic in the gruesome, the specific, the flesh. It tries to make do with language and imagination - and with silence and emptiness Nevertheless, Lanzmann's dogged, relentless pursuit of these people - murderers, officials and victims alike - across continents and countries is breathtaking and awesome, and some of the sequences, such as his having people sing the same songs they did in the camps, or drive the same locomotive on the same rails, or force their recollections through sobs and tears, have become famous and iconic images, even though, in my opinion, they aren't as devastating and heartrending as they're meant to be. Because the viewer is overwhelmed with information, with repetition, with hearing what he expects to hear. Overwhelmed but not injured, educated but not changed. And yet: what else could Lanzmann have done with his nearly lifelong, obsessive effort to keep these memories alive, to confront the remaining agents of horror - the faces and voices of what became unspeakable now appearing as common, sometimes ignorant, self-interested survivors whose very continuation into the present day seems an affront to humanity and biology. Can people live with such pain? With the inadequacy of words, of translation, the limits of memory? Can people still smile so heartlessly or pitiably, or be so helplessly, hopelessly willing to remember?  Can everything be explained, justified, transcended? The film itself came out 40 years after the Holocaust - and so much had already been forgotten, buried, outgrown and overgrown, denied. Now it's 67 years later.

Bayerl ""Specialist in having fun""","[18, 27]","This Lenten season, I've taken up the topic of the Holocaust for a fuller review than the stuff that generally comes out on PBS (though I do seem to recall them running this very film at one time or another).  Without any actual photographs or film clips from the 1940's, Lanzmann gives us the best portrait through the oral histories that I've yet to encounter in the visual media.  It was a bit annoying at times to wait for the interpreter to translate languages such as Polish into French, but the German part had substantial impact, since I claim to ""speak German"" and wish to study it more.  I've been through the whole film as in the 4-disc set, and have started doing the separate discs again.  Especially interesting to me was the extensive coverage of central and eastern European rail systems, with the fine assortments of how they looked in 1985.  I want to take another trip to that part of the world and see what it's like today (e.g., is there still such use of horses in Poland?).What gets me the most, I think, is that my overall impression of the way Europeans live is as a much more earnest, sincere and authentic style than some of the phoniness we put up with in America, but then they got into all of this, didn't they?

932594,ANBOOQR5NVJPM,B000AS4L16,S. A DUNN,"[44, 52]","The contents of this DVD is usually only obtained in libraries, research institutions and colleges.If one desires to get a complete understanding of the Holocaust and it's result, there is not a better investment you can make!Unlike stereotypical black and white Army documentaries of the result of Hitler's ""Final Solution,"" ""Shoah"" brings to light the personal human stories of the Holocaust, both from the side of the surviving perpretrators and the victims. Also brought to light are the testimonies of the casual witnesses in the countries that were involved. It is far more personal than Schindler's List. It is over 9 hours of history in your face.No archival footage was used in this presentation. It was filmed in the late 70's and early 80's by Claude Lanzmann. He interviews hundreds of surviving victims, SS officers and native populations of that era. Vividly through filming of the extermination camp sites, the ""De-Jewed"" villages in Poland, the forests where hundreds of thousands were burnt and buried, he brings the Holocaust to us in a personal, gut-wrenching manner.This is especially important today. One must obtain a heartfelt experience of the Holocaust to appreciate the efforts of the hundreds of thousands of American lives sacraficed then to put an end to that mad ""Thousand year Reich"" that sponsored the industrial scale butchery of humanity. Relying on the thousand year hatreds of ethnic groups in Europe, Hitler and his goons fanned those fires in the hopes of ""purifying"" humanity of those they personally hated. Never in the history of humanity has this been possible until the Industrial Revolution made possible the machinery, technology and science required to make death an industry, where even the by-products of the butchery were a commodity.In this movie you will see aged Jewish survivors of the ""Aktion Reinhard"" program. You will see them open up to Claude. You will see them break down in tears as he makes them remember the horrors that will haunt them the rest of their days. You will see many native Poles of that era, now as old people, as they reenact the slitting of their throats- the sign that they gave the trainloads of jews as they passed by them on their way to Treblinka. You will see hidden camera interviews of some surviving SS personell of those camps. As these people are being interviewed, Claude takes us on a visual tour of the camp properties as they appear today.It is as if ghosts come back to life. We witness the ghosts of forgotten landscapes give up their dead to our view.I cannot more powerfully reccomend you to obtain a copy of ""Shoah"" whatever the price. These days we are assaulted by Holocaust deniers, whether thay are Neo-Nazis spewing their excuses and hatreds through the media of Community Television of the internet, or Presidents of countries! Worst of all, there are even regimes in the world who sponsor Anti-Holocaust conventions in their country to discount and deny the reality of the Final Solution. This film is neccesary for everyone to examine the truth and examine their conciousnesses. ONLY through personal experience that this film depicts can collective humanity purify their souls so ""never again"" can such inhumanity and horror be revisited upon the world.After viewing this film, you will never hear a train whistle in the same way again!Look at the cover of this DVD set. You can see that aged train engineer, and the sign Treblinka. What you can't see there is shown in this film. It is that same engineer slitting his throat with his finger after the train passes that sign! All the people shown in this film have now died. But their ghosts, their souls and their stories are preserved forever in Shoah.",5,The Human Side Of The Holocaust,1259539200,"11 30, 2009",2009,3711,"['contents', 'DVD', 'usually', 'only', 'obtained', 'libraries', 'research', 'institutions', 'colleges.If', 'one', 'get', 'complete', 'understanding', 'Holocaust', 'result', 'not', 'better', 'investment', 'can', 'make', 'Unlike', 'stereotypical', 'black', 'white', 'Army', 'documentaries', 'result', 'Hitler', 'Final', 'Solution', 'Shoah', 'light', 'personal', 'human', 'stories', 'Holocaust', 'side', 'surviving', 'perpretrators', 'victims', 'Also', 'brought', 'light', 'are', 'testimonies', 'casual', 'witnesses', 'countries', 'were', 'involved', 'far', 'more', 'personal', 'Schindler', 'List', '9', 'hours', 'history', 'face.No', 'archival', 'footage', 'was', 'used', 'presentation', 'was', 'filmed', 'late', '70', 'early', '80', 'Claude', 'Lanzmann', 'hundreds', 'surviving', 'victims', 'SS', 'officers', 'native', 'populations', 'era', 'Vividly', 'filming', 'extermination', 'camp', 'sites', 'De-Jewed', 'villages', 'Poland', 'forests', 'where', 'hundreds', 'thousands', 'were', 'burnt', 'buried', 'Holocaust', 'personal', 'gut-wrenching', 'manner.This', 'especially', 'important', 'today', 'One', 'must', 'obtain', 'heartfelt', 'experience', 'Holocaust', 'appreciate', 'efforts', 'hundreds', 'thousands', 'American', 'lives', 'sacraficed', 'then', 'put', 'end', 'mad', 'Thousand', 'year', 'Reich', 'sponsored', 'industrial', 'scale', 'butchery', 'humanity', 'Relying', 'thousand', 'year', 'hatreds', 'ethnic', 'groups', 'Europe', 'Hitler', 'goons', 'fanned', 'fires', 'hopes', 'purifying', 'humanity', 'personally', 'hated', 'Never', 'history', 'humanity', 'been', 'possible', 'Industrial', 'Revolution', 'made', 'possible', 'machinery', 'technology', 'science', 'required', 'make', 'death', 'industry', 'where', 'even', 'by-products', 'butchery', 'were', 'commodity.In', 'movie', 'will', 'see', 'aged', 'Jewish', 'survivors', 'Aktion', 'Reinhard', 'program', 'will', 'see', 'open', 'up', 'Claude', 'will', 'see', 'break', 'down', 'tears', 'remember', 'horrors', 'will', 'haunt', 'rest', 'days', 'will', 'see', 'many', 'native', 'Poles', 'era', 'now', 'old', 'people', 'reenact', 'slitting', 'throats-', 'sign', 'gave', 'trainloads', 'jews', 'passed', 'way', 'Treblinka', 'will', 'see', 'hidden', 'camera', 'interviews', 'surviving', 'SS', 'personell', 'camps', 'people', 'are', 'being', 'interviewed', 'Claude', 'visual', 'tour', 'camp', 'properties', 'appear', 'today.It', 'ghosts', 'come', 'back', 'life', 'witness', 'ghosts', 'forgotten', 'landscapes', 'give', 'up', 'dead', 'view.I', 'can', 'not', 'more', 'powerfully', 'reccomend', 'obtain', 'copy', 'Shoah', 'price', 'days', 'are', 'assaulted', 'Holocaust', 'deniers', 'thay', 'are', 'Neo-Nazis', 'spewing', 'excuses', 'hatreds', 'media', 'Community', 'Television', 'internet', 'Presidents', 'countries', 'Worst', 'are', 'even', 'regimes', 'world', 'who', 'Anti-Holocaust', 'conventions', 'country', 'discount', 'deny', 'reality', 'Final', 'Solution', 'film', 'neccesary', 'everyone', 'examine', 'truth', 'examine', 'conciousnesses', 'personal', 'experience', 'film', 'can', 'collective', 'humanity', 'purify', 'souls', 'never', 'again', 'can', 'such', 'inhumanity', 'horror', 'be', 'revisited', 'world.After', 'viewing', 'film', 'will', 'never', 'hear', 'train', 'whistle', 'same', 'way', 'again', 'Look', 'cover', 'DVD', 'set', 'can', 'see', 'aged', 'train', 'engineer', 'sign', 'Treblinka', 'What', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'shown', 'film', 'same', 'engineer', 'slitting', 'throat', 'finger', 'train', 'sign', 'people', 'shown', 'film', 'have', 'now', 'died', 'ghosts', 'souls', 'stories', 'are', 'preserved', 'forever', 'Shoah']",N/A
