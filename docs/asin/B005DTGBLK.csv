1456048,A1AKCBFLLI1P7Z,B005DTGBLK,Doug,"[6, 9]","Every year, about this time...I get into the Christmas spirit. Instead of all the trash I usually watch throughout the year, my attention turns to holiday movies. A good one leaves you feeling like you haven't wasted the last 2 hours of your life. The good ones are either funny, sad, romantic, or a combination of all of them. Most are pretty predictable. You pretty much know where they're going from the get go. It's up to the director and the writers to make the journey enjoyable for the viewer. Unfortunately, for me, this movie had none of those things. Emily is a career girl off on a business trip. Ben is at home waiting for her to get back, so they can get married. Right away, we know the whole movie is going to be about the journey. Romance is out, because they're apart for 98% of the movie. Sad is out, because no one is sick, dying, or losing their home. It's now up to the creators to make Emily's trip, and Ben's experience with the family...funny. I wish I could say it was a ""Planes, Trains, and Automobiles"" experience, but it was far from it. I don't blame the actors. I blame the writers. The script was just plain boring all the way through. The cast did the best with what they had...",3,Forgettable Journey,1322956800,"12 4, 2011",2011,1210,"['year', 'time', 'get', 'Christmas', 'spirit', 'Instead', 'trash', 'usually', 'watch', 'year', 'attention', 'holiday', 'movies', 'good', 'one', 'feeling', 'have', ""n't"", 'wasted', 'last', '2', 'hours', 'life', 'good', 'ones', 'are', 'funny', 'sad', 'romantic', 'combination', 'Most', 'are', 'pretty', 'predictable', 'pretty', 'much', 'know', 'where', ""'re"", 'going', 'get', 'go', 'up', 'director', 'writers', 'make', 'journey', 'enjoyable', 'viewer', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'had', 'none', 'things', 'Emily', 'career', 'girl', 'business', 'trip', 'Ben', 'home', 'waiting', 'get', 'back', 'can', 'get', 'married', 'Right', 'away', 'know', 'whole', 'movie', 'going', 'be', 'journey', 'Romance', 'out', ""'re"", 'apart', '98', '%', 'movie', 'Sad', 'out', 'one', 'sick', 'dying', 'losing', 'home', 'now', 'up', 'creators', 'make', 'Emily', 'trip', 'Ben', 'experience', 'family', 'funny', 'wish', 'could', 'say', 'was', 'Planes', 'Trains', 'Automobiles', 'experience', 'was', 'far', 'do', ""n't"", 'blame', 'actors', 'blame', 'writers', 'script', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'boring', 'way', 'cast', 'did', 'best', 'what', 'had']",A Christmas Wedding

It showed two people who were in love and one did not realize how important her husband to be was until she let her boss and job almost come between them.  But in the end real loves perseveres and that is what matters.  It's a family friendly movies, there was no indecent language which won rave reviews with me. It also showed when you are determined to do something or get somewhere you forget about everything else and ""just do it"".

Maybe a couple of times during the Christmas season.  I really liked Eric Mabius in How To Fall In Love.  That's why I got this one.  I find most of the actors when watching other movies then check them out online to see what other movies they have made and select more to watch. I find the best movies are the ones made just for TV.

However, I am glad I finally did purchase it because I enjoyed the movie very much and it is a much more modern movie that the cover suggests. It is a pretty traditional romantic holiday movie but around the holidays those type of movies are so nice to watch. Please ignore the poor cover and give this movie a try.
