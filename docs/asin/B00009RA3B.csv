Both Scott Wolf and Tim Roth play good guys, it's just that they're motivated by different things. Roth sees Wolf's character as ""the man he could have been"" and takes the hit job as a personal vendetta. Then, as time progresses and he takes a new mind set, his outlook changes and you find yourself rooting more for his character than Wolf. But there are no bad actors in this film. I was never a Party of Five fan, but Wolf's acting here is nothing short of amazing! The story ends a little too abruptly (and with a major plot thread left out there), but I was still very satisfied with the movie when it was over. By the way, it gets its rating mostly from the language (and there's not really much of that) and the subject matter of the serial killer. If they'd just toned down a couple of the words, this could easily have passed for PG-13. A strong, compelling story that will hold you until the film is over.

It's a gritty cop drama about a police officer who belives he is dying (a mature and interesting Scott Wolf) and hires someone to kill him before his painful disease takes over his life.  Twists abound at every corner and this film, shot in Philadelphia, makes excellent use of the city and has a gritty, realistic feel.  The ending is a bit abrupt but the film is well acted (especially by Scott Wolf and by Tim Roth in a tricky role) and well made.  Kudos to director Keith Snyder, he should be proud of his debut film.  I only wish it got the theatrical release that it deserved.  Highly recommended !!!!! 4.5 stars",4,A little seen gritty gem set in Philadelphia,1062806400,"09 6, 2003",2003,783,"['was', 'originally', 'called', 'quot', 'Emmett', 'Mark', 'quot', 'saw', 'world', 'premiere', 'Philadelphia', 'World', 'Film', 'Festival', 'where', 'played', 'sell', 'out', 'crowds', 'gritty', 'cop', 'drama', 'police', 'officer', 'who', 'dying', 'mature', 'interesting', 'Scott', 'Wolf', 'someone', 'kill', 'painful', 'disease', 'life', 'abound', 'corner', 'film', 'shot', 'Philadelphia', 'excellent', 'use', 'city', 'gritty', 'realistic', 'feel', 'ending', 'bit', 'abrupt', 'film', 'well', 'acted', 'especially', 'Scott', 'Wolf', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'tricky', 'role', 'well', 'made', 'Kudos', 'director', 'Keith', 'Snyder', 'should', 'be', 'proud', 'debut', 'film', 'only', 'wish', 'got', 'theatrical', 'release', 'deserved', 'Highly', 'recommended', '4.5', 'stars']",N/A
