284380,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6301973313,Andrew Ellington,"[5, 5]","Lush and yet beautifully quiet, `The Old Maid' is one of those films that you may never see because its stars went on to make more noted films, but that's what makes discovering this beautiful film all the more exciting.  With stellar performances by the entire cast (especially a young and remarkably mature Bette Davis) and a script that will leave you in tears, `The Old Maid' is the definition of a hidden gem.Coming out in the year of all years (1939), it is easy to see how a film like `The Old Maid' could be overlooked with sweeping Hollywood epics and starry-eyed fairytales devouring the critical bests of the year.  Bette Davis herself starred in a slew of films this very year, and wound up Oscar nominated for her turn in `Dark Victory'.  Despite that, it is a shame that `The Old Maid' walked away without a mere mention at the Academy Awards, for it is a beautifully told and crafted film about love, life and sacrifice.Charlotte and Delia are cousins.  On the outset of the film, the wealthy and rather spoiled Delia is getting married, only to find that her lover, Clem, has finally returned from war to make her his bride.  She maintains composure and goes through with her wedding, while Charlotte confesses her love for Clem and soon finds herself pregnant with his child, only to hear of his death overseas.  Instead of acknowledge her child, Charlotte lives as if Clementina is just an orphan staying in the orphanage she helps manage.  When Charlotte is about to wed Delia's brother-in-law her secret is revealed and her life is thrust into turmoil.  In order to care for her daughter the best way possible, Charlotte winds up moving in with Delia and soon finds that her own daughter starts gravitating towards Delia and considers her, her mother.Thus, Charlotte becomes nothing but an old maid.Davis is spectacular here, for she really understands the heartbreak that her character is undergoing.  She emulates that sheltered love very well, wearing a mask of harshness that is lifted ever so lightly by the devastation and pain in her eyes.  Miriam Hopkins is also quite good here (she reminds me a lot of Lana Turner in her roles in films like `Imitation of Life'), but Davis acts circles around her (Davis does have the meatier role).  I also really adored Donald Crisp here (such a standout supporting player he was) and Jane Bryan's frustrated tantrums were effectively handled without ever straying into that `actorly' territory.In the end I really, really must recommend this film.  It is such a beautiful portrayal of parental love and sacrifice.  The pre-wedding night scene, where Charlotte enters her daughter's room, is just so heart-swelling; and that final kiss carries such emotional weight.  This film captures the true meaning of parenthood, even if this extreme case is one that hopefully we will never have to endure.",5,A mother's self-sacrificing love...,1263254400,"01 12, 2010",2010,2861,"['Lush', 'yet', 'beautifully', 'quiet', 'Old', 'Maid', 'one', 'films', 'may', 'never', 'see', 'stars', 'went', 'make', 'more', 'noted', 'films', 'what', 'discovering', 'beautiful', 'film', 'more', 'exciting', 'stellar', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'especially', 'young', 'remarkably', 'mature', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'script', 'will', 'leave', 'tears', 'Old', 'Maid', 'definition', 'hidden', 'gem.Coming', 'out', 'year', 'years', '1939', 'easy', 'see', 'how', 'film', 'Old', 'Maid', 'could', 'be', 'overlooked', 'sweeping', 'Hollywood', 'epics', 'starry-eyed', 'fairytales', 'devouring', 'critical', 'bests', 'year', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'starred', 'slew', 'films', 'very', 'year', 'wound', 'up', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'turn', 'Dark', 'Victory', 'shame', 'Old', 'Maid', 'walked', 'away', 'mere', 'mention', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'beautifully', 'told', 'crafted', 'film', 'love', 'life', 'sacrifice.Charlotte', 'Delia', 'are', 'cousins', 'outset', 'film', 'wealthy', 'rather', 'spoiled', 'Delia', 'getting', 'married', 'only', 'find', 'lover', 'Clem', 'finally', 'returned', 'war', 'make', 'bride', 'composure', 'wedding', 'Charlotte', 'love', 'Clem', 'soon', 'finds', 'pregnant', 'child', 'only', 'hear', 'death', 'overseas', 'Instead', 'acknowledge', 'child', 'Charlotte', 'Clementina', 'just', 'orphan', 'staying', 'orphanage', 'manage', 'When', 'Charlotte', 'wed', 'Delia', 'brother-in-law', 'secret', 'revealed', 'life', 'thrust', 'turmoil', 'order', 'care', 'daughter', 'best', 'way', 'possible', 'Charlotte', 'up', 'moving', 'Delia', 'soon', 'finds', 'own', 'daughter', 'gravitating', 'towards', 'Delia', 'mother.Thus', 'Charlotte', 'nothing', 'old', 'maid.Davis', 'spectacular', 'here', 'really', 'heartbreak', 'character', 'undergoing', 'sheltered', 'love', 'very', 'well', 'wearing', 'mask', 'harshness', 'lifted', 'ever', 'so', 'lightly', 'devastation', 'pain', 'eyes', 'Miriam', 'Hopkins', 'also', 'quite', 'good', 'here', 'lot', 'Lana', 'Turner', 'roles', 'films', 'Imitation', 'Life', 'Davis', 'circles', 'Davis', 'have', 'meatier', 'role', 'also', 'really', 'adored', 'Donald', 'Crisp', 'here', 'such', 'standout', 'supporting', 'player', 'was', 'Jane', 'Bryan', 'frustrated', 'tantrums', 'were', 'effectively', 'handled', 'ever', 'straying', 'actorly', 'end', 'really', 'really', 'must', 'recommend', 'film', 'such', 'beautiful', 'portrayal', 'parental', 'love', 'sacrifice', 'pre-wedding', 'night', 'scene', 'where', 'Charlotte', 'daughter', 'room', 'just', 'so', 'heart-swelling', 'final', 'kiss', 'such', 'emotional', 'weight', 'film', 'true', 'meaning', 'parenthood', 'even', 'extreme', 'case', 'one', 'hopefully', 'will', 'never', 'have', 'endure']",Old Maid VHS
284381,A2T74RP19O2K4Q,6301973313,Ben,"[1, 4]","I'm happy enough watching this, but I sure ain't gonna start a parade.It starts off with Davis as a bridesmaid, ducking out on her duties (that always happens) to do the nasty with Geroge Brent.  Who supposedly is involved with Miriam Hopkins (who phones it in a la Norma Shearer), but Hopkins is marrying Brent's brother, ""A Ralston!"" and Davis winds up havinga baby.That she hides and he hides and everybody hide hides.  Davis does the only thing she can do: open an orphange.""Twenty children to hide one!""The baby grows up and poor Bette is waylaid by so many emotions she becomes an old maid. At 25 or so.  The precise age where every woman becomes an old maid. But it's Davis so we just live with this cinematic fluff.  She will never make love again with any man.  Hopkins, as her cousin, who married the ""Ralston"" of choice,  takes the kid in and raises it as her own.  The great lie begins.Of course the girl grows up. And, according to the doctor (there was always a doctor hanging around in these parts and times) he diagnoses the girl as being ""too happy"".WTF?  The girl is ""roo happy"", and so we must MUST reel her in.  And she's in love.""When she walks, she dances, when she laughs, she sings"" or some such BS.  That's the good doctor's diagnosis.  We, as the audience, can do nothing to sway him.  We sit there and take it. Too happy????  Is there even such a thing?  But the doctor gives his verdict and everyone worries about ""the girl"".  The girl that Davis borned and that Hopkins raises.  How on earth can anyone be too happy?  Obviously, it's a sickness in this 1800 (circa) year or so clap=trap.  Too happy. Please.I would love to be so happy and not have a doctor tell me that I was ""too happy"".  Happiness as a sickness?  WTF?Davis is marvelous, and so, sometimes, is Hopkins.

284382,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,6301973313,Byron Kolln,"[2, 2]","One of Davis' most overlooked gems, 1939's THE OLD MAID (based on the Zoe Akins play which itself was drawn from the Edith Wharton novel) finds Ms Davis in peak form, playing opposite rival Miriam Hopkins as cousins bound together by a scandalous family secret.On the day of her marriage into the rich Ralston family, Delia Lovell (Miriam Hopkins) is shocked to welcome a visit from her former beau, Clem Spender (George Brent).  Explaining to him that money and stability mean much more to her than romantic bliss in the long-term, Delia breaks off their relationship for good.  Looming in the wings is Delia's meek cousin Charlotte (Bette Davis), who privately reveals her own feelings for Clem, before he leaves for the Civil War.Years pass, in which time Clem is revealed to have been killed in battle.  Charlotte opens a home for displaced war orphans, but there's one child amongst the brood that's more special than the others - Tina - her secret lovechild with Clem.  When Charlotte's last hope for marriage is dashed and Delia's husband is killed in an accident, the two women and their respective children all move in together, where the roles of the ""mother"" and ""aunt"" of Tina become blurred for respectability's sake.  Charlotte dutifully assumes the mantle of Tina's fussy, strait-laced aunt, but how long can she keep her silence about Tina's true parentage?THE OLD MAID is a grand drama, much too refined and accomplished to ever be regarded as ""soap"", despite often being labelled as such.  Bette Davis' softer roles are frequently forgotten in the wake of her ferocious turns in ""All About Eve"", ""Baby Jane"", etc., but let us never forget that she could also underplay her parts when the scripts called for it as well.It's in THE OLD MAID that the long-standing rivalry between Davis and Miriam Hopkins came to the boil.  Their feud had started in the previous year, when Davis starred (to Oscar-winning effect) in ""Jezebel"", in the same role that Hopkins had played on Broadway in 1933--and no doubt also felt she should have reprised in the film!  Things weren't helped much when Davis insisted on calling Miriam by the sickly-sweet nickname of ""Hoppy"" on the set.  Their feud was in fact largely welcomed by publicists, who used the antagonistic angle to help play up anticipation for the film.  In 1943, Davis and Hopkins teamed for the second (and last) time in ""Old Acquaintance"".George Brent was a frequent Bette Davis co-star (it's been said that she considered him something of a good luck charm) and could successfully play opposite her without shifting the spotlight.  In the same year, they also starred together in ""Dark Victory"", but the role of Clem in THE OLD MAID had in fact originally been offered to Humphrey Bogart, who spent a few days in the part before leaving the film.Jane Bryan co-stars as the grown Tina.  If anybody could convincingly play the offspring of Bette Davis it was Ms Bryan, who, in the same year as THE OLD MAID, starred opposite James Cagney in the landmark prison drama ""Each Dawn I Die"".

Miriam Hopkins rejects him for marriage to wealth and position and Bette Davis gives berth to his daughter out of wedlock. The film is a tour-de-force for Davis as she ages into a withered spinster, watching as Hopkins takes over the role of mother of her foundling. This is all pretty melodramatic stuff but Davis has the talent and skill to make her role very moving. Unfortunately, she is paired with that dreadful Miriam Hopkins, an actress who never missed an opportunity to gesture when it wasn't required and manages to foul up the bitterness between the 2 women by playing for sympathy and not ageing at all. No wonder Davis loathed her offscreen. The film is a sumptuous studio product and the DVD print is excellent.The package comes with a comprehensive set of mainly mediocre extras, part of Warner's Night at the Movies, the best of which are the cartoons. The technicolour short on Abraham Lincoln may be a reasonable history lesson but it is artificial and dull.

The child's father, George Brent, was Hopkins' former fiance, and was killed in the Civil War.  Needless to say, it's a painful thing to watch her daughter calling another woman Mother.  Davis gives a sympathetic, tightly controlled performance that anchors the film.  Hopkins' character isn't well defined, although she manages to give the character some dimension.  Brent, in the presence of these two actresses staking their territories, is his customary non-presence.  Jane Bryan, as the grown up daughter, again shows that it is too bad her career in Hollywood didn't last more than a few years.  She's excellent as the spoiled, headstrong girl.  The film has a number of quiet, moving moments, although I found the pacing a little slow.

Clem returns home, only to find that the woman he loves, Delia, is getting married that same day. She is marrying a rich banker and, though she loves Clem, a ne'er do well, she wants security, so she goes through with the marriage. Seeing and seizing an opportunity, Charlotte declares herself to Clem, telling him how she has always loved him, as he goes off to fight in the war.Duting the war, Charlotte manages to hook up with Clem long enough to get pregnant. While away, ostensibly to recover from an illness, she has Clem's out of wedlock baby, unbeknownst to the very married Delia. Clem, in the meantime is killed in action. When Charlotte returns home, she converts her stables into a foundling home for war orphans. Among them is a special favorite named Tina.Charlotte decides to marry her cousin's brother-in-law. On the day of her wedding, Charlotte confesses to Delia what happened between her and Clem and tells her the truth about Tina. Delia, insanely jealous over this, puts a crimp in Charlotte's wedding plans. and the wedding never takes place.Charlotte remains single and becomes a bitter and formidable woman whom Tina knows as Aunt Charlotte. Delia, meanwhile, has Tina call her &quot;Mummy&quot;, much to Charlotte's chagrin. Delia is having the ultimate revenge, as she has never forgiven Charlotte for her amatory trespass. As Tina grows into womanhood, she speaks disparagingly to Charlotte, saving her love and adoration for &quot;Mummy&quot;. As Tina approaches the age at which young women marry, Charlotte makes the ultimate sacrifice for her daughter. It is a sacrific that Tina will never know, but one that will allow Tina to have the hapiness that Charlotte never had.Miriam Hopkins and Bette Davis give wonderful performances, each compelling in its own way. Charlotte's appearance toward the end of the film is a caricature of the proverbial old maid, while Delia remains youthful and vibrant. Undoubtedly, Charlotte's appearance is a result of her suffering, knowing that her own flesh and blood loves another, as a child love's its mother.

Bette Davis was riding high as Hollywood's elite actress and in this film she shows how she could morph from a kindly and vivacious young woman to one who has aged unmercifully and deliberately all the while showing a mean streak that is mean only on the surface.  Director Edmund Goulding surrounded Miss Davis with a reliable stable of actors who had worked well with her in the past.  George Brent, who had just played her husband in DARK VICTORY, now is in love with Delia (Miriam Hopkins), who jilts him to marry into money.  Delia still loves him but coldly chooses a life of material things over love.  Bette Davis is Charlotte, Delia's cousin, who consoles Clem only too well, winding up in his arms.  She discretely has a baby off screen and chooses to raise her with the child thinking that Delia is the mother and Charlotte is ""Aunt Charlotte.""  Jane Bryan is Trina, who grows up loving Delia as her mother even knowing that she is not her biological daughter. What marks this film as the apex of sudsers is the shedding that each of the three female stars had to undergo relative to their respective motivations.  Bette Davis had to age in a most ungraceful manner in the second half of the film.  She is surprisingly mean to Jane Bryan, explaining her coldness only as a desire to hide the bitter truth.  Miriam Hopkins seemingly ages not at all, but she sheds her original skin of cold-bloodedness to become increasingly more humane and lovable as the film winds down.  As a subtext to the knowledeable theater-goer, in real life Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins were bitter rivals who spoke not a word together off screen.  Yet, their final scenes of reconciliation ring true.  Jane Byran plays against type as one who shouts at Charlotte: ""You are a dried up prune of an old maid.  You hate me because I am young and attractive and you are not.""  In earlier films Miss Bryan had played Miss Davis' love rival (KID GALAHAD) and her sister (MARKED WOMAN). Here as her daughter, Jane Bryan's lashing out at a woman who torments her for no apparent reason (at least to her)is no more than many other young women would have done.  By the last reel, each of the three women have gained at least a partial understanding of their basic drives and needs.  THE OLD MAID is a marvelous film that suggests that oldness need not be a disqualifying factor in determining one's essential goodness.",5,As Good as Suds Can Get,1260576000,"12 12, 2009",2009,2465,"['OLD', 'MAID', 'one', 'most', 'remarkable', 'tearjerkers', 'time', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'was', 'riding', 'high', 'Hollywood', 'elite', 'actress', 'film', 'how', 'could', 'morph', 'kindly', 'vivacious', 'young', 'woman', 'one', 'who', 'aged', 'unmercifully', 'deliberately', 'while', 'showing', 'mean', 'streak', 'mean', 'only', 'surface', 'Director', 'Edmund', 'Goulding', 'surrounded', 'Miss', 'Davis', 'reliable', 'stable', 'actors', 'who', 'had', 'worked', 'well', 'past', 'George', 'Brent', 'who', 'had', 'just', 'played', 'husband', 'DARK', 'VICTORY', 'now', 'love', 'Delia', 'Miriam', 'Hopkins', 'who', 'jilts', 'marry', 'money', 'Delia', 'still', 'coldly', 'life', 'material', 'things', 'love', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'Charlotte', 'Delia', 'cousin', 'who', 'Clem', 'only', 'too', 'well', 'winding', 'up', 'arms', 'discretely', 'baby', 'screen', 'chooses', 'raise', 'child', 'thinking', 'Delia', 'mother', 'Charlotte', 'Aunt', 'Charlotte', 'Jane', 'Bryan', 'Trina', 'who', 'up', 'loving', 'Delia', 'mother', 'even', 'knowing', 'not', 'biological', 'daughter', 'What', 'film', 'apex', 'sudsers', 'shedding', 'three', 'female', 'stars', 'had', 'undergo', 'relative', 'respective', 'motivations', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'had', 'age', 'most', 'ungraceful', 'manner', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'surprisingly', 'mean', 'Jane', 'Bryan', 'explaining', 'coldness', 'only', 'desire', 'hide', 'bitter', 'truth', 'Miriam', 'Hopkins', 'seemingly', 'not', 'original', 'skin', 'cold-bloodedness', 'become', 'increasingly', 'more', 'humane', 'lovable', 'film', 'down', 'subtext', 'knowledeable', 'theater-goer', 'real', 'life', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'Miriam', 'Hopkins', 'were', 'bitter', 'rivals', 'who', 'spoke', 'not', 'word', 'together', 'screen', 'final', 'scenes', 'reconciliation', 'ring', 'true', 'Jane', 'Byran', 'type', 'one', 'who', 'Charlotte', 'are', 'dried', 'prune', 'old', 'maid', 'hate', 'am', 'young', 'attractive', 'are', 'not', 'earlier', 'films', 'Miss', 'Bryan', 'had', 'played', 'Miss', 'Davis', 'love', 'rival', 'KID', 'GALAHAD', 'sister', 'MARKED', 'WOMAN', 'Here', 'daughter', 'Jane', 'Bryan', 'lashing', 'out', 'woman', 'who', 'apparent', 'reason', 'least', 'more', 'many', 'other', 'young', 'women', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'last', 'reel', 'three', 'women', 'have', 'gained', 'least', 'partial', 'understanding', 'basic', 'drives', 'needs', 'OLD', 'MAID', 'marvelous', 'film', 'oldness', 'need', 'not', 'be', 'disqualifying', 'factor', 'determining', 'one', 'essential', 'goodness']",Old Maid VHS
284396,A152C8GYY25HAH,6301973313,Matthew Horner,"[15, 17]","This melodrama / tearjerker is fairly typical of Hollywood from the 1930s to the 1960s - a basically decent woman breaks the moral code of her day and pays dearly for it. The story is interesting, but its biggest asset is Bette Davis' rather subdued performance as Charlotte Lovell, the woman who pays the price. Made in 1939, the film is from Davis' golden period. She was nominated for an Academy Award every year from 1939 to 1943. While her work here is strong, she received no special acclaim for it, possibly because the role is so similar to the one she played in the superior ""Jezebel"", for which she won an Oscar in 1939.The movie begins during the Civil War. Socialite Delia Lovell [Miriam Hopkins] is about to be wed, and her cousin Charlotte is in attendance. When Delia learns that the man she promised to marry two years earlier is in town, she sends Charlotte to beg him not to make a scene. The guy is one Charlotte is secretly in love with, and she winds up consoling him in a very intimate fashion. Several years pass. The man has been killed in the war, and Charlotte is running a home for war orphans. When Delia learns that one of the children is actually one Charlotte had out of wedlock and that the father was the dead soldier, she destroys Charlotte's chance to marry a very prominent man. In a cruel twist of fate, Charlotte's daughter grows up in Delia's home and is led to believe that her mother is her aunt.Bette Davis was a rather unusual star for her time because she was also a consummate actress. As such, she demanded roles in which glamour and beauty were often cast aside. Stunningly pretty in the first part of the movie, she spends the rest of it heavily made up to look like a dowdy old maid aunt. It's a startling transformation. By contrast, her co-star, Ms. Hopkins, typical of female stars at the time, barely ages at all. Hopkins actually gives a sensitive, studied performance, but, because of her determination to portray her character as realistically as possible, Davis totally dominates the picture.The photography and the sets are first-rate. The script seems a little truncated, and I wonder if the print we have today is an edited one that the studio made for second run engagements. [This was a common practice in those days.] The score by Max Steiner is not one of his best and relies heavily on stock music, such as Old My Darling Clementine and Wagner's Wedding March. But when would he have had the time to compose one of his full, lush scores for the movie? He worked on at least a dozen movies that year.

Bette then must stand by and watch as the daughter grows up treating her contemptuosly as a spinster aunt.  Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins had thier legendary ""feud"" during the making of this highly esteemed yet mostly forgotten Davis vehicle.In her playing of the sacrificial - mother role of Charlotte Lovell, Bette gives an admirable and creditable performance, but in her playing of this type of part (the sacrificial mother)  - which was meat-and-potatoes to many a trouper - Davis builds her characterisation so painstakingly that she tends to lose her flair and her character turns rather mealy. While this film seems to be a deliberate attempt to play upon the viewer's emotions, it's a superior mother-love story; the entire production has style, which is enhanced by Orry-Kelly's costume designs and Max Steiner's music score. My only real complaint is that the daughter (Jane Bryan) never finds out that Davis (as her ""old maid"" Aunt Charlotte) is indeed her mother and because she never finds out the truth, Bette is made out to be a martyr and the viewer is left more than a trifle unsatisfied.

The behind the scenes story of this production makes very amusing reading as two notorius scene stealers and grand dames went into daily war with each other. Amazingly this terrible tension however never shows on screen and the two women have a terrific screen chemistry that glows in one scene after another.""The Old Maid"" is a beautiful story that is nevertheless one full of tragedy, regret and pent up emotions. Davis's character has a brief affair with George Brent's character after Hopkins character passes him over to marry into money. The result is a child which Miriam Hopkins adapts and raises as her own . ""Tina"" the child, spends her youth calling Davis ""Aunt Charlotte"" and never does find out the truth about who her mother actually is. It is the stuff that great soaps are made of but the two actresses here carry it off beautifully and raise the story to great art.George Brent, so often a co star in Davis vechicles here plays Clem Spencer, the object of both women's affection who is killed in the civil war. Brent's character dies less than half way through the film but his presence remains front and centre for the rest of the film and largely controls the lives of both women. He is very effective in his role and appears less stiff than he does in alot of Warner Bros 1940's vechicles. The great character actor Donald Crisp lends his usual dignified presence to this production. Crisp, an exceptional actor, I dont think ever gave a bad performance and here plays the family Doctor who witnesses over a number of years all the tragedy and heartbreak experienced by the two women and is the only one , with the exception of Hopkins's Delia, who knows Tina's real parentage.The overraul look of the film is lavish and I feel it resembles an MGM production in some ways more than a Warner Bros one. Attention to sets and in particular costumnes and lighting is first class and in reality Bette Davis, long thought of as no great beauty in Hollywood here looks terrific and in  the scene where she is in her own Wedding dress for her marriage which doesn't take place, she looks stunning.""The Old Maid"" has so many wonderfully touching moments and the one that never fails to move me is the concluding moment of the film after Tina's own wedding has taken place and where finally Delia and Charlotte are able to unite and put aside past grievances and regrets and walk arm in arm back through the front door which closes behind them. Never fails to bring great emotion forward!!!As a less well known film of Bette Davis I know you will be very moved by this excellent production which I would rate among her top 5 performances.",5,One of Bette Davis's greatest films,1020124800,"04 30, 2002",2002,3383,"['often', 'think', 'Old', 'Maid', 'been', 'unfairly', 'forgotten', 'film', 'historians', 'get', 'overshadowed', 'other', 'famous', 'Davis', 'vechicles', 'time', 'Dark', 'Victory', 'Now', 'Voyager', 'Letter', '.Bette', 'Davis', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'role', 'Charlotte', 'Lovell', 'young', 'lady', 'who', 'one', 'indiscretion', 'doomed', 'spend', 'life', 'bitter', 'old', 'maid', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'be', 'real', 'mother', 'daughter', 'who', 'others', 'affection', 'guidance.The', 'film', 'justly', 'famous', 'first', 'two', 'screen', 'teamings', 'Davis', 'Miriam', 'Hopkins', 'resulted', 'fireworks', 'daily', 'basis', 'two', 'locked', 'horns', 'aspect', 'production', 'making', 'nightmare', 'assignment', 'talented', 'director', 'Edmund', 'Goulding', 'scenes', 'story', 'production', 'very', 'amusing', 'reading', 'two', 'notorius', 'scene', 'stealers', 'grand', 'dames', 'went', 'daily', 'war', 'other', 'Amazingly', 'terrible', 'tension', 'however', 'never', 'screen', 'two', 'women', 'have', 'terrific', 'screen', 'chemistry', 'one', 'scene', 'Old', 'Maid', 'beautiful', 'story', 'nevertheless', 'one', 'full', 'tragedy', 'regret', 'pent', 'up', 'emotions', 'Davis', 'character', 'brief', 'affair', 'George', 'Brent', 'character', 'Hopkins', 'character', 'marry', 'money', 'result', 'child', 'Miriam', 'Hopkins', 'adapts', 'own', 'Tina', 'child', 'youth', 'calling', 'Davis', 'Aunt', 'Charlotte', 'never', 'find', 'out', 'truth', 'who', 'mother', 'actually', 'stuff', 'great', 'soaps', 'are', 'made', 'two', 'actresses', 'here', 'carry', 'off', 'beautifully', 'raise', 'story', 'great', 'art.George', 'Brent', 'so', 'often', 'co', 'star', 'Davis', 'vechicles', 'here', 'Clem', 'Spencer', 'object', 'women', 'affection', 'who', 'killed', 'civil', 'war', 'Brent', 'character', 'less', 'half', 'way', 'film', 'presence', 'front', 'centre', 'rest', 'film', 'largely', 'lives', 'women', 'very', 'effective', 'role', 'less', 'stiff', 'alot', 'Warner', 'Bros', '1940', 'vechicles', 'great', 'character', 'actor', 'Donald', 'Crisp', 'usual', 'dignified', 'presence', 'production', 'Crisp', 'exceptional', 'actor', 'dont', 'think', 'ever', 'gave', 'bad', 'performance', 'here', 'family', 'Doctor', 'who', 'number', 'years', 'tragedy', 'heartbreak', 'experienced', 'two', 'women', 'only', 'one', 'exception', 'Hopkins', 'Delia', 'who', 'Tina', 'real', 'parentage.The', 'overraul', 'look', 'film', 'lavish', 'feel', 'MGM', 'production', 'ways', 'more', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'one', 'Attention', 'sets', 'particular', 'costumnes', 'lighting', 'first', 'class', 'reality', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'long', 'thought', 'great', 'beauty', 'Hollywood', 'here', 'terrific', 'scene', 'where', 'own', 'Wedding', 'dress', 'marriage', ""n't"", 'take', 'place', 'stunning', 'Old', 'Maid', 'so', 'many', 'wonderfully', 'touching', 'moments', 'one', 'never', 'move', 'concluding', 'moment', 'film', 'Tina', 'own', 'wedding', 'taken', 'place', 'where', 'finally', 'Delia', 'Charlotte', 'are', 'able', 'unite', 'put', 'aside', 'past', 'grievances', 'regrets', 'walk', 'arm', 'arm', 'back', 'front', 'door', 'Never', 'bring', 'great', 'emotion', 'forward', 'less', 'well', 'known', 'film', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'moved', 'excellent', 'production', 'would', 'rate', 'top', '5', 'performances']",Old Maid VHS

It may be something for an intelligent teen daughter to watch with her mother. If you like tense films where a lot of the tension is between women, you might like it. It's very much a soap-opera type of movie with drama around female relationships; it's surprising most of the reviewers are men.The acting is certainly first rate, but at times you may find they lay it on a bit thick. The ending is somewhat surprising, yet not completely satisfying, and somewhat sad. Recommended also for mothers who put a child up for adoption and maybe still wonder if they made the right decision. Or any birth mothers who are considering finally uniting with their child (esp. daughter). You can really feel their deeply personal struggle.",3,Serious Chick Flick,1248566400,"07 26, 2009",2009,852,"['decent', 'movie', 'women', 'reviewer', 'called', 'mother-love', 'story', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'date', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'something', 'intelligent', 'teen', 'daughter', 'watch', 'mother', 'like', 'tense', 'films', 'where', 'lot', 'tension', 'women', 'might', 'like', 'very', 'much', 'soap-opera', 'type', 'movie', 'drama', 'female', 'relationships', 'surprising', 'most', 'reviewers', 'are', 'men.The', 'acting', 'certainly', 'first', 'rate', 'times', 'may', 'find', 'lay', 'bit', 'thick', 'ending', 'somewhat', 'surprising', 'yet', 'not', 'completely', 'satisfying', 'somewhat', 'sad', 'Recommended', 'also', 'mothers', 'who', 'put', 'child', 'up', 'adoption', 'maybe', 'still', 'wonder', 'made', 'right', 'decision', 'birth', 'mothers', 'who', 'are', 'considering', 'finally', 'uniting', 'child', 'esp', 'daughter', 'can', 'really', 'feel', 'deeply', 'personal', 'struggle']",Old Maid VHS
