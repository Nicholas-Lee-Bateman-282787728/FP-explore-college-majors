I have a somewhat bad back and am in my 30s. (my weight is normal/underweight) The Yoga Zone video was easy to follow, good paced, they explained the manuvers well. The twisting and stretches are targeted to mainly your back so do not expect a full body stretch. I can't say the poses totally cured my back problem but I am much more flexible and the excercises leave me feeling great afterward. Neck/shoulder tension were also a huge problem and that has improved immensely!  I'm sticking with this one! I'm trying Yoga Zone for Stretching and Flexibility next.UPDATE: I have been using the poses from this video and Stretching for Flexibility for 2 years and have had just amazing results! I have noticed health improvements in areas that had nothing to do with my back. Migrain headaches for instance are completely gone. Also frequent indigestion cramps are gone and just a whole list of problems have basically disappeared. These videos have been about the best thing I have spent money on!

661257,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B00005K9PO,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[14, 14]","I don't have back problems, but my back and shoulders often feel sore after long hours of sitting in front of a computer at work.  I found that the two practices on Yoga Zone's Yoga for a Strong and Healthy Back DVD provided gentle stretches which helped to both elongate and relax my spine.  Each program is billed as being 20 minutes long, although I clocked them both at closer to 18 minutes.The first practice is led by Jennifer Monness with Jeanne assisting, and it is filmed it a grassy wooded setting.  This session focuses mainly on twisting postures, mostly performed in a standing position.  After grounding you in mountain pose, Jennifer leads you through gentle twists in chair and then a series of other twisting standing poses, including pyramid, revolved prayer twist, twisting fan pose (wide-legged forward bend), and a deeper chair twist.  After about 15 minutes, she moves to the floor for several minutes of work in bound angle (cobbler's pose), ending the practice iwht seated meditation.The second practice is led by Douglas Stewart with Suzanne assisting; this time it's an oceanfront setting.  Although this practice includes twists as well, the focus is more on spinal undulations and extensions, with the majority of the postures being performed on the floor.  Douglas starts the practice in a seated position, performing a simple seated twist and then moving to hands and knees for cat spinal rolls.  He then moves to just a few standing postures, including down dog, twisting chair, and fan pose.  The practice returns to the floor for a sequence which includes potted palm (with spinal undulations), boat, bridge, and reclined poses; again, the practice ends with a seated meditation.Both Jennifer and Douglas instruct well.  Although they do frequently suggest modifications, they don't offer much specific information on form or alignment; therefore, I wouldn't recommend this video for those who are brand-new to yoga.  I have been practicing yoga for several years now and consider myself to be about at an intermediate level, so I found these practices to be quite gentle.  However, my back still felt as if it got a good stretch, and those newer to yoga are likely to find this video to be a bit more of a challenge.",4,Two very nice yoga practices offer gentle twists and stretches for your back,1135900800,"12 30, 2005",2005,2250,"['do', ""n't"", 'have', 'back', 'problems', 'back', 'shoulders', 'often', 'feel', 'sore', 'long', 'hours', 'sitting', 'front', 'computer', 'work', 'found', 'two', 'practices', 'Yoga', 'Zone', 'Yoga', 'Strong', 'Healthy', 'Back', 'DVD', 'provided', 'gentle', 'stretches', 'helped', 'elongate', 'relax', 'spine', 'program', 'billed', 'being', '20', 'minutes', 'long', 'clocked', 'closer', '18', 'minutes.The', 'first', 'practice', 'led', 'Jennifer', 'Monness', 'Jeanne', 'assisting', 'filmed', 'grassy', 'wooded', 'setting', 'session', 'mainly', 'twisting', 'postures', 'mostly', 'performed', 'standing', 'position', 'grounding', 'mountain', 'pose', 'Jennifer', 'gentle', 'twists', 'chair', 'then', 'series', 'other', 'twisting', 'standing', 'poses', 'including', 'pyramid', 'revolved', 'prayer', 'twist', 'twisting', 'fan', 'pose', 'wide-legged', 'forward', 'bend', 'deeper', 'chair', 'twist', '15', 'minutes', 'floor', 'several', 'minutes', 'work', 'bound', 'angle', 'cobbler', 'pose', 'ending', 'practice', 'iwht', 'seated', 'meditation.The', 'second', 'practice', 'led', 'Douglas', 'Stewart', 'Suzanne', 'assisting', 'time', 'oceanfront', 'setting', 'practice', 'twists', 'as', 'well', 'focus', 'more', 'spinal', 'undulations', 'extensions', 'majority', 'postures', 'being', 'performed', 'floor', 'Douglas', 'practice', 'seated', 'position', 'performing', 'simple', 'seated', 'twist', 'then', 'moving', 'hands', 'knees', 'cat', 'spinal', 'rolls', 'then', 'just', 'few', 'standing', 'postures', 'including', 'down', 'dog', 'twisting', 'chair', 'fan', 'pose', 'practice', 'returns', 'floor', 'sequence', 'potted', 'palm', 'spinal', 'undulations', 'boat', 'bridge', 'reclined', 'poses', 'again', 'practice', 'seated', 'meditation.Both', 'Jennifer', 'Douglas', 'instruct', 'well', 'do', 'frequently', 'suggest', 'modifications', 'do', ""n't"", 'offer', 'much', 'specific', 'information', 'form', 'alignment', 'therefore', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'video', 'who', 'are', 'brand-new', 'yoga', 'have', 'been', 'practicing', 'yoga', 'several', 'years', 'now', 'consider', 'be', 'about', 'intermediate', 'level', 'found', 'practices', 'be', 'quite', 'gentle', 'However', 'back', 'still', 'felt', 'got', 'good', 'stretch', 'newer', 'yoga', 'are', 'likely', 'find', 'video', 'be', 'bit', 'more', 'challenge']",Yoga Zone - Yoga for a Strong and Healthy Back
661258,A3PO3YRFX4BI2J,B00005K9PO,CMCM,"[12, 12]","After too many strenuous days of skiing, I got hit by lower back spasms, which shocked me because I thought I was in fairly good shape.  I go to the gym and work with weights, I ski in winter, bike in summer.  I do frequent stretch routines.  So my sudden back problem threw me for a loop!  My chriopractor helped, and as it turned out, he's very into Yoga and suggested some yoga poses which helped a lot.  This led me to search for yoga DVD's that are back specific and I figured at this point in my life (I'm 57), Yoga might be a good addition to the mix of exercise.  Since there weren't many back specific DVDs, I got this one and found that I like it a lot.  The two sessions are only 20 min. each, which allows me to sneak in a session here and there whereas a longer, more involved program would be less easy to make routine.  None of the exercises were extreme for a beginner, and were done with 2 people, one of which would often point out things and modifications on the other one as the pose was being done.  Directions were easy and clear....after watching this a couple of times I think you would then remember and be able to follow directions without keeping an eye on the TV constantly.  After the pose was explained, comments on how you could modify the pose to be easier were given.  Douglas, on the 2nd session, has a very clear, calming voice and his explanations and comments were very good and to the point, very useful and clarifying.The Jamaica ocean beach setting on the 2nd session was especially wonderful, and I could almost imagine myself there doing yoga on the beach as well.  I found the whole DVD was low key and quite relaxing.  Oddly, I don't recall a thing about the music...so I'd say at least it wasn't distracting.  Maybe I was enjoying the beach scene too much to notice the music.The key with this or any other such DVD is to be regular with it and give it a chance to work.  And if you are new to Yoga, follow the instructor comments about how to do the various poses.  As I said, none of them are anything that requires expertise or a high level of fitness or yoga experience, but that certainly doesn't mean they don't have an effect.  The harder ones can easily be modified in the beginning as necessary.One thing many people complain about is that yoga DVDs are often slow and boring.  I used to think that too, but now I'm finding this slow pace quite relaxing and enjoyable.  I plan to take a little trip to the Jamaica beach and do this DVD every day and I'll report back about how successful it is in rehabbing my back.

661265,ARF5OI5V9OI00,B00005K9PO,Max A. Lebow,"[8, 9]","If you have ever had back pain, check with your doctor before using Yoga for a Strong and Healthy Back.The instructor presents the basics of postures and yoga breathing with no nonsense, and no jargon. Using this program takes about 20-minutes of workout time per day.The instructor focuses on the lower back, often neglected in general exercise videos. There is also plenty of work for the upper back, too. Viewers learn poses that utilize the lower back, such as the warrior pose.The video contains two complete, 20-minute workouts, one for beginners -- featuring Jennifer and Jeanne -- and one for survivors of the first -- featuring Douglas and Suzanne. The second workout contains more advanced poses, and stretches that keep your back supple and happy.Have your doctor review both workouts if he or she is unfamiliar with them. Users of either level can improve back flexibility without getting frustrated with impossible poses.The video was made in Jamaica, known for its beautiful, white-sand beaches and breathtaking scenery. The Grand Lido Sans Souci Resort in Ochos Rios hosted the taping of the original video.The video features original music which greatly enhances the experience, it is an easy-to-listen-to sound that seems to move between Salsa and Reggae.All Yoga Zone videos are created with guidance from Yoga Master Alan Finger, founder of The Yoga Zone in Manhattan in 1992. A second generation Yoga Master, Alan has practiced yoga for over 35 years. After opening up modest yoga studios in the New York metropolitan area, The Yoga Zone became well-known, and opened a studio in Old Brookville, on Long Island, New York, which accepts students for private lessons. Interested viewers can learn more about The Yoga Zone at [...] Information about The Yoga Zone on TV is also available there.Aside from the general benefits of yoga -- relaxation and refreshment -- this video can help keep your back flexible, strong and healthy.The DVD is probably a better value than the tape, since one need not rewind or fast forward with the DVD.",4,The Benefits of Yoga and a Healthy Back,1142035200,"03 11, 2006",2006,2053,"['have', 'ever', 'had', 'back', 'pain', 'check', 'doctor', 'using', 'Yoga', 'Strong', 'Healthy', 'Back.The', 'instructor', 'basics', 'postures', 'yoga', 'breathing', 'nonsense', 'jargon', 'Using', 'program', '20-minutes', 'workout', 'time', 'day.The', 'instructor', 'lower', 'back', 'often', 'neglected', 'general', 'exercise', 'videos', 'also', 'plenty', 'work', 'upper', 'back', 'too', 'Viewers', 'learn', 'poses', 'utilize', 'lower', 'back', 'such', 'warrior', 'pose.The', 'video', 'two', 'complete', '20-minute', 'workouts', 'one', 'beginners', 'featuring', 'Jennifer', 'Jeanne', 'one', 'survivors', 'first', 'featuring', 'Douglas', 'Suzanne', 'second', 'workout', 'more', 'advanced', 'poses', 'stretches', 'keep', 'back', 'supple', 'happy.Have', 'doctor', 'review', 'workouts', 'unfamiliar', 'Users', 'level', 'can', 'improve', 'back', 'flexibility', 'getting', 'frustrated', 'impossible', 'poses.The', 'video', 'was', 'made', 'Jamaica', 'known', 'beautiful', 'white-sand', 'beaches', 'breathtaking', 'scenery', 'Grand', 'Lido', 'Sans', 'Souci', 'Resort', 'Ochos', 'Rios', 'hosted', 'taping', 'original', 'video.The', 'video', 'original', 'music', 'greatly', 'experience', 'easy-to-listen-to', 'sound', 'move', 'Salsa', 'Reggae.All', 'Yoga', 'Zone', 'videos', 'are', 'created', 'guidance', 'Yoga', 'Master', 'Alan', 'Finger', 'founder', 'Yoga', 'Zone', 'Manhattan', '1992', 'second', 'generation', 'Yoga', 'Master', 'Alan', 'practiced', 'yoga', '35', 'years', 'opening', 'up', 'modest', 'yoga', 'studios', 'New', 'York', 'metropolitan', 'area', 'Yoga', 'Zone', 'became', 'well-known', 'opened', 'studio', 'Old', 'Brookville', 'Long', 'Island', 'New', 'York', 'students', 'private', 'lessons', 'Interested', 'viewers', 'can', 'learn', 'more', 'Yoga', 'Zone', '[', ']', 'Information', 'Yoga', 'Zone', 'TV', 'also', 'available', 'there.Aside', 'general', 'benefits', 'yoga', 'relaxation', 'refreshment', 'video', 'can', 'help', 'keep', 'back', 'flexible', 'strong', 'healthy.The', 'DVD', 'probably', 'better', 'value', 'tape', 'one', 'need', 'not', 'rewind', 'fast', 'forward', 'DVD']",Yoga Zone - Yoga for a Strong and Healthy Back

I thought perhaps that ""Yoga Zone - Yoga for a Strong and Healthy Back"" could help me. I'll just say upfront that I'm not an exerciser. I sit on my butt all day at work, and while I do common household chores, I get terribly bored with workouts and so I rarely do organized routines. I also had never tried yoga, although it seemed a lot more interesting than many workout styles I have looked at.The instructors were quite clear and the setting beautiful. My back was also hurting pretty bad that first night because I overdid it without realizing it. I cannot stress enough that unless you are some kind of yoga master you must TAKE IT EASY when you are starting on this program. No matter how easy their movements seem, just be a lot more careful than you think you need to. After I experienced that terrible soreness, I continued doing the program but was much, much more careful. Now, after a couple of weeks, my back feels overall feels better and stronger, and the after-workout soreness has lessened considerably.",4,Take it very easy in the beginning and you'll be OK,1086220800,"06 3, 2004",2004,1128,"['have', 'had', 'bad', 'back', 'past', 'five', 'six', 'years', 'nothing', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'tried', 'really', 'worked', 'thought', 'perhaps', 'Yoga', 'Zone', 'Yoga', 'Strong', 'Healthy', 'Back', 'could', 'help', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'upfront', ""'m"", 'not', 'exerciser', 'sit', 'butt', 'day', 'work', 'do', 'common', 'household', 'chores', 'get', 'terribly', 'bored', 'workouts', 'so', 'rarely', 'do', 'organized', 'routines', 'also', 'had', 'never', 'tried', 'yoga', 'seemed', 'lot', 'more', 'interesting', 'many', 'styles', 'have', 'looked', 'at.The', 'instructors', 'were', 'quite', 'clear', 'setting', 'beautiful', 'back', 'was', 'also', 'hurting', 'pretty', 'bad', 'first', 'night', 'overdid', 'realizing', 'can', 'not', 'stress', 'enough', 'are', 'kind', 'yoga', 'master', 'must', 'TAKE', 'IT', 'EASY', 'when', 'are', 'starting', 'program', 'matter', 'how', 'easy', 'movements', 'seem', 'just', 'be', 'lot', 'more', 'careful', 'think', 'need', 'experienced', 'terrible', 'soreness', 'continued', 'doing', 'program', 'was', 'much', 'much', 'more', 'careful', 'Now', 'couple', 'weeks', 'back', 'feels', 'overall', 'feels', 'better', 'stronger', 'after-workout', 'soreness', 'lessened', 'considerably']",Yoga Zone - Yoga for a Strong and Healthy Back

If you have problems rotating at the mid back or suffer muscle spasms in the lat area this will cause problems as it did for me. If you want an upper/mid back mild stretch then by all means buy it because it is definately good for that.
