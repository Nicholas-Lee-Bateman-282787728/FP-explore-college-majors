It does feature a few people who were not interviewed in previous Till books or documetnaries (some who appear only in shadows and under assumed names on camera) and one lady witness even reveals one of the biggest mysteries of the Till case-the name of the Black traitor who told Milam and Bryant about the alleged ""wolf whistle."" (This appears in the director's commentary). We also see some post-production footage of the Till case being reopened because of some of these interviews.However, I would have to give the edge to the ""American Experience"" documentary DVD on this subject, as that one does a better job of getting the viewer to know who Emmett Till was as a person before the murder and as he grew up in Chicago.Both are good, so I would recommend to those who want to know about the Till case to watch both of these DVDs.",4,"Gret, but see this before the ""American Experience"" DVD",1160179200,"10 7, 2006",2006,966,"['great', 'documentary', 'Till', 'case', 'director', 'Keith', 'Beauchamp', 'clearly', 'lot', 'subject', 'feature', 'few', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'not', 'interviewed', 'previous', 'Till', 'books', 'documetnaries', 'who', 'appear', 'only', 'shadows', 'assumed', 'names', 'camera', 'one', 'lady', 'witness', 'even', 'one', 'biggest', 'mysteries', 'Till', 'case-the', 'name', 'Black', 'traitor', 'who', 'told', 'Milam', 'Bryant', 'alleged', 'wolf', 'whistle', 'director', 'commentary', 'also', 'see', 'post-production', 'footage', 'Till', 'case', 'being', 'reopened', 'interviews.However', 'would', 'have', 'give', 'edge', 'American', 'Experience', 'documentary', 'DVD', 'subject', 'one', 'better', 'job', 'getting', 'viewer', 'know', 'who', 'Emmett', 'Till', 'was', 'person', 'murder', 'grew', 'up', 'Chicago.Both', 'are', 'good', 'would', 'recommend', 'who', 'want', 'know', 'Till', 'case', 'watch', 'DVDs']",The Untold Story of Emmett Louis Till

As I grew older, this story haunted me so I tried to find more information, but the history books at school were limited and pieces of information gradually surfaced more and more as the year went by.

Factually presented and emotionally balanced.  The facts alone evoke emotions that reminds one of the horrific potential of humanity to acconmplish evil against another human being. And beyond that, the willingness to cover the truth by the guilty parties and peer citizens goes beyond the ugliness of the act itself. The family and friends that recall that day in their lives amazed me that they could do so in such a calm and factual manner.  I commend their courage for the sake of telling Emmit's story so that his death would not have been in vain. His mother's parting thought that it was her faith in the Lord and His comfort that gave her the strength to go on, until then, as a mother I could not fathom the weight of the pain she must have endured.

Beauchamp spent years conducting interviews and doing research in support of his documentary film The Untold Story of Emmett Louis Till. As you may know, Emmett was a young boy from Chicago who went down south to Mississippi to visit relatives. During his visit he whistled at a white woman outside of a store and days later he was brutally beaten and murdered. Emmett's murder caused a huge shift in the struggle for civil rights. His case also African Americans to protest and strike out against lynchings.The Untold Story of Emmett Louis Till is the best documentary every produced about the Emmett Till case. What makes this documentary unique is the first person interviews Beauchamp scored for the film. These never before seen interviews in conjunction with archive footage paint a picture of the events surrounding Till's murder and the case afterwards that has never been seen. The interviews with Mamie Till-Mobley are excellent. She remembers with so much detail the events leading up to Emmett's murder and the struggle that she went through after the muder and during the trial. The film also includes interview footage of the brother of Medgar Evars, Emmett's cousins, Reverend Al Sharpton and more. It's a great film and it's captivating. The DVD includes a directors commentary and a featurette titled ""The Impact of the Emmett Till Case in American History and Today."" This film is so special it should be used in ever Black American Studies program and every African-American family should own a copy of this film. Many people feel like lynching and racism are far in the past, but watching this film will make people realize that what happened 51 years ago is an important part of not only African-American history but American history.",5,Excellent Documentary,1139961600,"02 15, 2006",2006,1861,"['think', 'know', 'everything', 'Emmett', 'Louis', 'Till', 'case', 'think', 'again', 'Young', 'film', 'maker', 'Keith', 'A.', 'Beauchamp', 'spent', 'years', 'conducting', 'interviews', 'doing', 'research', 'support', 'documentary', 'film', 'Untold', 'Story', 'Emmett', 'Louis', 'Till', 'may', 'know', 'Emmett', 'was', 'young', 'boy', 'Chicago', 'who', 'went', 'down', 'south', 'Mississippi', 'visit', 'relatives', 'visit', 'whistled', 'white', 'woman', 'store', 'days', 'later', 'was', 'brutally', 'beaten', 'murdered', 'Emmett', 'murder', 'caused', 'huge', 'shift', 'struggle', 'civil', 'rights', 'case', 'also', 'African', 'Americans', 'protest', 'strike', 'out', 'lynchings.The', 'Untold', 'Story', 'Emmett', 'Louis', 'Till', 'best', 'documentary', 'produced', 'Emmett', 'Till', 'case', 'What', 'documentary', 'unique', 'first', 'person', 'interviews', 'Beauchamp', 'scored', 'film', 'never', 'before', 'seen', 'interviews', 'conjunction', 'archive', 'footage', 'paint', 'picture', 'events', 'surrounding', 'Till', 'murder', 'case', 'afterwards', 'never', 'been', 'seen', 'interviews', 'Mamie', 'Till-Mobley', 'are', 'excellent', 'so', 'much', 'detail', 'events', 'leading', 'up', 'Emmett', 'murder', 'struggle', 'went', 'muder', 'trial', 'film', 'also', 'interview', 'footage', 'brother', 'Medgar', 'Evars', 'Emmett', 'cousins', 'Reverend', 'Al', 'Sharpton', 'more', 'great', 'film', 'captivating', 'DVD', 'directors', 'commentary', 'featurette', 'titled', 'Impact', 'Emmett', 'Till', 'Case', 'American', 'History', 'Today', 'film', 'so', 'special', 'should', 'be', 'used', 'ever', 'Black', 'American', 'Studies', 'program', 'African-American', 'family', 'should', 'own', 'copy', 'film', 'Many', 'people', 'feel', 'lynching', 'racism', 'are', 'far', 'past', 'watching', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'people', 'realize', 'what', 'happened', '51', 'years', 'ago', 'important', 'part', 'not', 'only', 'African-American', 'history', 'American', 'history']",The Untold Story of Emmett Louis Till

These are obviously not people who have been coached or scripted, but people speaking from their very hearts.  Especially touching is the testimony of Mamie Till, Emmett's mother, to whose memory this documentary is dedicated.  Her courage and bravery come through in this documentary as do her humanity and individuality.  One is able to see one's own mother or grandmother in her, and this brings to the foreground the shock, the sorrow, and the human element in this whole tragedy.One reviewer warned of the graphic image shown in this documentary of Emmett Till's mutilated face.  As an educator, I strongly feel it is important that we present the absolute truth of Emmett Till's kidnapping, torture and murder, no matter how unpleasant it may be.  My fear is not that a parent or administrator will question me on my decision to present this documentary to my class, but that we as teachers will become afraid to present the uncomfortable yet essential truths of our country's history; and isn't this what more than anything makes possible the kind of society where routine atrocities are able to flourish -- a society which, as Harper Lee states in _To Kill a Mockingbird_, ""...[preserves] polite fiction at the expense of human life""?The tragedy of Emmett Till is a defining moment of the U.S. in the twentieth century, but in order to fully appreciate the significance of this tragedy, we must feel how it impacted the lives of those closest to him.

963713,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000DZ95MQ,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[81, 82]","It was in August of 1955 that 15-year-old Emmett Till was sent from Chicago by his mother to spend the summer with his great uncle, Moses Wright, in Money, Mississippi.  On August 24, Till and some other black teenagers who had been picking cotton went to Bryant's Grocery and Meat Market to get some candy.  In the store Till allegedly whistled at Carolyn Bryant.  When her husband returned from a trip several days later and heard about the incident, Bryant and his half-brother J. W. Milam decided to ""teach the boy a lesson.""  On August 28, they kidnapped Till from his uncle's house, too him to a plantation shed, brutalized the boy, shot him, and dumped his body in the Tallahatchie river, having tied a seventy pound fan from a cotton gin around Till's neck with barbed wire.  The two men were tried and found not guilty by an all-white jury.  In January 1956 their confession was paid for and published by ""Look"" magazine.  Both men would die from cancer, Milam in 1980 and Bryant in 1990.I do not remember when I first heard of Emmett Till, but the story of the black teenager who was killed by white men in Mississippi for the crime of whistling at a white woman was a pivotal event in energizing the Civil Rights Movement and I have known about it for a long time.  However, I never saw a photograph of Emmett Till's body until I was at the Seattle Art Museum looking at an exhibit having to deal with depictions of race and gender in art, and there was a small photograph of Till's body on display at his funeral.  The photograph was too small to tell any details, but you were struck by the swollen and misshaped head.  It did not look human, but then to Milam and Bryant, Emmett Till was never a human being.The title of Keith A. Beauchamp's documentary is ""The Untold Story of Emmett Louis Till,"" not because the story has not been told, but because the people he interviewed, including Till's mother, Mamie Carthan Mobley, along with several cousins and friends from that summer in Mississippi, never had a chance to tell their story in court.  Beauchamp provides them with that opportunity, using newsreel footage from 1955 as well.  It follows the chronology of events, from Till's birth to the present and Beauchamp's own investigations into the case (his chief claim is that up to 14 other people were involved in the crime in various ways).  For just telling the story and covering the facts, Beauchamp keeps things pretty basic in his documentary, letting people speak for themselves.The most unforgettable part of the documentary is when Mobley tells the story of getting her son's body back home.  Officials in Mississippi wanted to bury the body before anybody got a good look at it and when Mobley managed to get it back to Chicago the coffin was nailed shut.  But she got it opened and then describes what it was she saw in simple and graphic details, emphasizing not the horrors but the child she remembered (e.g., she smiles as she talks about how she thought Emmett's teeth were the most beautiful things she had ever seen and then remembering seeing only two of them and wondering where the rest of them were).  It is only after Beauchamp lets her tell of the pivotal point where she decides to leave the casket open at the funeral so the world can see what was done to her son in Mississippi that we go from a school photograph of a smiling Emmett Till to the wrecked ruin of his face and head.  This is the most disturbing image from the Civil Rights movement, but that is exactly why it is the most important one and why its publication in ""Jet"" was an important catalyst.  You really cannot tell the story unless you look at the photograph, and teachers who want to show this documentary to their students should be prepared to defend their decision.In addition to Mobley, it is Moses Wright, who stood up in court and pointed to the two white men who came and took away Till (there is a photograph of the dramatic moment), who stands out here.  But it strikes me that somebody who is not mentioned by name, William Bradford Huie, played a key role as well.  A journalist and author (""The Americanization of Emily,"" ""The Klansman""), Huie was often criticized by mainstream journalists for using his checkbook to get stories.  But it was Huie who paid the murderers to confess in a national publication five months later.  A follow up story revealed that the businesses of Milam and Bryant had gone under because they were ostracized by local whites.  I am sure this did not happen because of the murders, which clearly the jury representing the town supported, but because of the published confession that took away the thin veneer provided by the not guilty verdict.This documentary received a lot of publicity because it fueled an effort to reopen the case.  The U.S. Department of Justice did reopen the case to determine whether others in addition to Milam and Bryant were involved.  The F.B.I. and Mississippi officials worked on a joint investigation, and while Till's body was exhumed so an official autopsy could be performed, the federal investigation was closed in March of this year.  Consequently, justice in this case will not result in anybody ending up in jail, but rather with preserving the testimony of these witnesses for posterity (Till's mother died after the documentary was completed).  Carolyn Bryant (now Donham after her fourth husband) is still alive and living in Greenville Mississippi.  Signs in her front yard warn that uninvited visitors will be prosecuted, an apparent indication that she believes the law in Mississippi continues to protect her a lot more than it ever did Emmett Till.",5,The story of the murder and funeral that galvanized the Civil Rights Movement,1151884800,"07 3, 2006",2006,5654,"['was', 'August', '1955', '15-year-old', 'Emmett', 'Till', 'was', 'sent',

How gruesome.  Emmett Louis Till deserved what any other person deserved, to live and love, instead his life was cut short.  This is very painful to watch.  Emmett's Mother, Mrs. Mobley, was such an inspiration, her words touched me, she was a wonderful woman.This is a must-see film, it is always a good idea to see history so we do not forget what ""civilized"" man is capable of.

Emmett Louis Till was 15 years old who was the loving son of Mrs. Till. His father died in World War II under suspicious circumstances. His mother and family migrated north from Mississippi to Chicago, Illinois. When he was 15 years old, he traveled with his family to Money, Mississippi to spend time there before going back to school in the fall.Chicago and Money were different as night and day. Emmett had no idea of the dangers that lurked in the South. According to reports, he made a pass at white woman which was totally ludicrous at Bryant's Deli when he handed her money. He also supposedly whistled at her as well. According to his mother, he had a speech impediment because he survived polio and he was only out on one date with a girl his age by that time.According to his mother, Emmett was a beautiful son who was naive in the South. Emmett's crimes which were ridiculous was found out by Bryant's husband and her brother-in-law. He was kidnapped and savagely beaten. He was found in the river in Mississippi. During the time period of 1955, this documentary recounts Emmett's final days and moments with his beloved mother, Mamie Till-Mobley. She would die after this documentary finished. His body was left deformed and badly beaten. The Southern authorities wanted to leave his body in a grave right away but Mamie wouldn't have it. She wanted her son in Chicago and she wanted to see him one last time.According to her, we got only a hint of the horror that she saw when he returned home in a locked coffin. Nobody in Mississippi wanted anybody else to see what happened to that 14 year old boy. Finally enough was enough and the story of Emmett Till's murder and his open-casket funeral opened the door to the civil rights movement. Who is to say that his savage, heinous murder which was unjustified and nobody held accountable led to the civil rights movement? Emmett Till was just a young man who was wrongly taken away from his family and from us.I am angry at the lack of injustice which led to a revolution and the Civil Rights movement for African Americans during the terrible time.

Bostic,"[2, 3]","I was about 15 years old in the tenth grade when I heard about this story for the first time as Emitts mother re-told the famous story again to Oprah Winfrey on her show. I remember Oprah warning the audience about the upcoming images being very graphic...I didnt care, (as usual) I wanted to see how the boy looked after hearing that horrible story. Oprah said that photo of his face was on the cover of JET magazine etc.... When that photo flashed across that screen I was literlly in shock, could not move. I dreamed nightmares of that image back when I was younger. That was in the 90's I am 33 years old now with 2 children of my own & my god forbid that ever is to occur with any of my kids. That image has haunted me all these years until I would tell & ask anybody about this story.I got this DVD a couple of years ago. I watch it every Black History month with my now 11 year old daughter. As a child you realize this is a terrible story. But as an adult & parent you feel this mothers pain, you respect her as a woman & mother- having so much courage...as to show the world the UGLY face of EVIL & RACISM during that time. & To know that this 14 year old young man was beaten, toutured, shot & killed, by these evil cold hearted white men because the boy ""whistled"" at a white lady (& not hardly the best looking white woman, at that---trust me, if you seen her, its like ""OH PLEASE""!) you think OMG...this was senseless & rediculous the boy had to lose his life over something like that? White people made their own STUPID RULES back in the South against Black people & they were called ""Jim Crow laws"".The Killers didn't get to do any jail time during that time thanks to an all WHITE JURY (as usual). But later on many years later sadly after Emitt's mom passes away...Justice does prevail. But I am almost certain that image of Emitt's disfigured, decomposed, face haunted those evil men for many years (thats a form of justice in itself). Especially since they thought that body would never be found.AMERICA has a seriously UGLY past & it began with SLAVERY.
