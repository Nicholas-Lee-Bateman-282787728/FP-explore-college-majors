1269078,A3GKMQFL05Z79K,B002I41KKA,blackaciddevil,"[2, 3]","Village of the Damned and Children of the Damned has always been two of my favorite 'evil-kid' movies. There's just something inherently creepy & disturbing about kids, sad but true, and that's why movies such as the previously mentioned are just so dadblamed good. Along comes The Children.The story is about a Christmas and New Year's holiday that degenerates into a fight for survival when the children start turning on their parents. It all starts out with the local children succumbing to an unknown afflication. Starting off with a dead-eye stare and eventually leading to some pretty awful homicidal behavior. The parents must figure out a way to defend themselves against them and combat whatever force is transforming their innocent children into murderous monsters.After viewing this movie, I have to admit I've found me a newer favorite. The Children is, by and far, one of the best horror films to come from Britain in a long, long time. It's slow in its' execution but it delivers in all its' thrills and chills. Not only that but it makes me have more faith in the direct-to-DVD market(where most movies are cheap cash-ins and whatnot). Director Tom Shankland did an excellent job and I hope, at some future point, he decides to give us another visit to the land of The Children.Creepy but intense, The Children delivers and you'd be a fool to miss out on this one, folks.

Turner ""B.A.T.""","[7, 20]","You will find a lot of this review may not make perfect sense, because the film itself is so bad its hard to no where to start and where to stop to hopefully save someone some stress, time, and money. Certainly do not watch this to calm you, or to find something new (except for a new mindset of terrible acting, directing, and editing).Okay, the film was released on Ocotber the 6th, and you will notice about 50% of the reviews were on the exact release date. They PRAISED the film... You can easily see a pattern that almost seems like the only people whom wrote good reviews were part if the crew that had a part in the film.THE STORY: For the 1st hour there is sqealing & screaming and of course the movie starts out with someone vommiting. It seems any time there is a loss for footage, the producer, director, or editor will take you to a quick shot of Vomit in a film. The film is all SUPPOSED to be based on the Children in the movies acting quality (since the film is obviously about the children). You're going to probably do like us and come back to Amazon just to see what people found even half way ""decent"" about this film. The last 20-30 minutes is all you will need to watch. I would not suggest paying more than a Redbox/Netflix 99 cent rental for this, even if you have a Blu-Ray player and HDTV (as I do). The kids are finally ""told"" to act (I think they were at least maybe trying) during the last 20 minutes.THE CAMERA WORK: Jumpy... Non stop jumpiness to seem to be in attempt to dodge almost all of the footage of the film. It's confusing it's so terrible.I would explain more, but Im just speachless at this point. The only comment I can leave is I think I would have been VERY angry at any video store for allowing me to rent this film without at least warning me that I was about to waste 5+ Dollars for a rental. I would not even let someone purchase this film for more than 99 cents in Blu-Ray form if I were to sell it on eBay. I would feel that bad about allowing the person to pay a dime to see it. Oh goodness... I dont know what to tell you other than ""Good Luck"" if you read this and still plan to spend more than 99 cents for the rental.",1,"Pay attention to REVIEW ""Dates"", This was horrible!",1259884800,"12 4, 2009",2009,2173,"['will', 'find', 'lot', 'review', 'may', 'not', 'make', 'perfect', 'sense', 'film', 'so', 'bad', 'hard', 'where', 'start', 'where', 'stop', 'hopefully', 'save', 'someone', 'stress', 'time', 'money', 'Certainly', 'do', 'not', 'watch', 'calm', 'find', 'something', 'new', 'new', 'mindset', 'terrible', 'acting', 'directing', 'editing', '.Okay', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'Ocotber', '6th', 'will', 'notice', 'about', '50', '%', 'reviews', 'were', 'exact', 'release', 'date', 'PRAISED', 'film', 'can', 'easily', 'see', 'pattern', 'almost', 'only', 'people', 'whom', 'wrote', 'good', 'reviews', 'were', 'part', 'crew', 'had', 'part', 'film.THE', 'STORY', '1st', 'hour', 'sqealing', 'screaming', 'course', 'movie', 'out', 'someone', 'vommiting', 'time', 'loss', 'footage', 'producer', 'director', 'editor', 'will', 'take', 'quick', 'shot', 'Vomit', 'film', 'film', 'SUPPOSED', 'be', 'based', 'Children', 'movies', 'acting', 'quality', 'film', 'obviously', 'children', ""'re"", 'going', 'probably', 'do', 'come', 'back', 'Amazon', 'just', 'see', 'what', 'people', 'found', 'even', 'half', 'way', 'decent', 'film', 'last', '20-30', 'minutes', 'will', 'need', 'watch', 'would', 'not', 'suggest', 'paying', 'more', 'Redbox/Netflix', '99', 'cent', 'rental', 'even', 'have', 'Blu-Ray', 'player', 'HDTV', 'do', 'kids', 'are', 'finally', 'told', 'act', 'think', 'were', 'least', 'maybe', 'trying', 'last', '20', 'minutes.THE', 'CAMERA', 'WORK', 'Jumpy', 'Non', 'stop', 'jumpiness', 'seem', 'be', 'attempt', 'dodge', 'almost', 'footage', 'film', 'confusing', 'so', 'terrible.I', 'would', 'explain', 'more', 'Im', 'just', 'speachless', 'point', 'only', 'comment', 'can', 'leave', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'VERY', 'angry', 'video', 'store', 'allowing', 'rent', 'film', 'least', 'warning', 'was', 'about', 'waste', '5+', 'Dollars', 'rental', 'would', 'not', 'even', 'let', 'someone', 'purchase', 'film', 'more', '99', 'cents', 'Blu-Ray', 'form', 'were', 'sell', 'eBay', 'would', 'feel', 'bad', 'allowing', 'person', 'pay', 'dime', 'see', 'Oh', 'goodness', 'dont', 'know', 'what', 'tell', 'other', 'Good', 'Luck', 'read', 'still', 'plan', 'spend', 'more', '99', 'cents', 'rental']",N/A
1269080,A2FPDWTD9AENVK,B002I41KKA,Carl Manes,"[2, 3]","THE CHILDREN stands out as one of the better entries from the recent revival in British Horror. A family's idyllic trip to their country getaway in the snow ends in bloodshed when the children are overcome by a mysterious illness that causes them to attack and kill their parents. It starts off slowly, with what seems like a series of accidents, but things quickly take a terrifying turn for the worst. Director Tom Shankland understands how to produce old-fashioned scares using a slow, creeping suspense and an elevated mood. After a slow and calculated build, the action is unleashed at a lightning pace, with many horrifying moments along the way. Shankland has found a group of children that are so sweet and innocent in appearance that it seems impossible that they would be able to do anyone any harm. It is therefore that much more alarming when they do begin playing their deadly games. While the film does feature some shocking gore, it is only used to punctuate its moments of suspense. The bright red of the blood contrasted against the pure white snow is also quite disturbing. THE CHILDREN shares much more in common with Serrador's WHO CAN KILL A CHILD than it does with many of the American-made killer children pictures, which typically give a lighter tone to the taboo theme of child murder. Shankland has created a dark, bloody, and mean-spirited survival film with a hopelessly downbeat ending.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",4,The Children,1294185600,"01 5, 2011",2011,1446,"['CHILDREN', 'out', 'one', 'better', 'entries', 'recent', 'revival', 'British', 'Horror', 'A', 'family', 'idyllic', 'trip', 'country', 'getaway', 'snow', 'bloodshed', 'when', 'children', 'are', 'overcome', 'mysterious', 'illness', 'attack', 'kill', 'parents', 'slowly', 'what', 'series', 'accidents', 'things', 'quickly', 'take', 'terrifying', 'turn', 'worst', 'Director', 'Tom', 'Shankland', 'how', 'produce', 'old-fashioned', 'scares', 'using', 'slow', 'creeping', 'suspense', 'elevated', 'mood', 'slow', 'calculated', 'build', 'action', 'unleashed', 'lightning', 'pace', 'many', 'horrifying', 'moments', 'way', 'Shankland', 'found', 'group', 'children', 'are', 'so', 'sweet', 'innocent', 'appearance', 'impossible', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'anyone', 'harm', 'therefore', 'that', 'much', 'more', 'alarming', 'when', 'do', 'begin', 'playing', 'deadly', 'games', 'film', 'feature', 'shocking', 'gore', 'only', 'used', 'punctuate', 'moments', 'suspense', 'bright', 'red', 'blood', 'contrasted', 'pure', 'white', 'snow', 'also', 'quite', 'disturbing', 'CHILDREN', 'shares', 'much', 'more', 'common', 'Serrador', 'WHO', 'CAN', 'KILL', 'A', 'CHILD', 'many', 'American-made', 'killer', 'children', 'pictures', 'typically', 'give', 'lighter', 'tone', 'taboo', 'theme', 'child', 'murder', 'Shankland', 'created', 'dark', 'bloody', 'mean-spirited', 'survival', 'film', 'hopelessly', 'downbeat', 'ending.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",N/A

1269082,A18D0R137EYS6C,B002I41KKA,Clinton Enlow,"[13, 15]",I've seen both Paul Andrew Williams The Cottage and Tom Shanklands W Delta Z and nothing in those films would have been harbinger for The Children. Its been compared to Who Can Kill a Child and in some ways the comparison is apt as it involves children slowly succumbing to some unknown cause that turns them violent towards adults. Who Can Kill a Child was more involved in creating suspense in the unknown and questioning the idea of violence against children. The Children like the recent Grace more or less involves parents and their children and the lengths people will go to protect their offspring even when those kids might have set up a trap for an adult invovling sleds and gardening equipment. This might be a big statement but its one of the best British horror films since The Descent.How does it achieve this? It simply sets up its situation and its story. Two families come together before Christmas carrying their children to a remote area in the woods. Slowly with one event the children start showing signs of sickness. The parents however are too self absorbed in their own problems complicated by teenager Casey whos acting rebellious flirting with her uncle and trying to hide a tatoo from her parents. Slowly though things begin to change. There are hints but things are never clear until the first fatality. Then the adults are scrambling around looking for their children while Casey begins to suspect the truth trying to warn adults who only want to protect their children even if those kids are coming at them with a pair of scissors.The children as it is is a slow burn of a film that is more about tension and suspense than gore. The gore is still there in flashes and glimpses. The kills are brutal and effective as they're happening to characters who are well defined and acted. And unlike Who Can Kill a Child I'll admit even the violence to the little tykes was unnerving without feeling exploitative. This is an excellent film a great addition to the new Ghost House Underground series. Even if you didn't like last years releases do check this one out.For the price you do get a great release for a budget. The audio is terrific while the visuals a bit grainy in the opening do improve and make one of the better discs from Lionsgate. To go with the film theres also quiet a bevy of featurettes that are better than most. All in all a recommended disc though I'm more for the movie than anything else.,5,The Children,1254787200,"10 6, 2009",2009,2435,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'Paul', 'Andrew', 'Williams', 'Cottage', 'Tom', 'Shanklands', 'W', 'Delta', 'Z', 'nothing', 'films', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'harbinger', 'Children', 'been', 'compared', 'Who', 'Can', 'Kill', 'Child', 'ways', 'comparison', 'apt', 'children', 'slowly', 'succumbing', 'unknown', 'cause', 'violent', 'towards', 'adults', 'Who', 'Can', 'Kill', 'Child', 'was', 'more', 'involved', 'creating', 'suspense', 'unknown', 'questioning', 'idea', 'violence', 'children', 'Children', 'recent', 'Grace', 'more', 'less', 'involves', 'parents', 'children', 'lengths', 'people', 'will', 'go', 'protect', 'offspring', 'even', 'when', 'kids', 'might', 'have', 'set', 'up', 'trap', 'adult', 'invovling', 'sleds', 'gardening', 'equipment', 'might', 'be', 'big', 'statement', 'one', 'best', 'British', 'horror', 'films', 'Descent.How', 'achieve', 'simply', 'up', 'situation', 'story', 'Two', 'families', 'come', 'together', 'Christmas', 'carrying', 'children', 'remote', 'area', 'woods', 'Slowly', 'one', 'event', 'children', 'start', 'showing', 'signs', 'sickness', 'parents', 'however', 'are', 'too', 'self', 'absorbed', 'own', 'problems', 'complicated', 'teenager', 'Casey', 'whos', 'acting', 'rebellious', 'flirting', 'uncle', 'trying', 'hide', 'tatoo', 'parents', 'Slowly', 'things', 'begin', 'change', 'are', 'hints', 'things', 'are', 'never', 'clear', 'first', 'fatality', 'Then', 'adults', 'are', 'scrambling', 'looking', 'children', 'Casey', 'suspect', 'truth', 'trying', 'warn', 'adults', 'who', 'only', 'want', 'protect', 'children', 'even', 'kids', 'are', 'coming', 'pair', 'scissors.The', 'children', 'slow', 'burn', 'film', 'more', 'tension', 'suspense', 'gore', 'gore', 'still', 'flashes', 'glimpses', 'kills', 'are', 'brutal', 'effective', ""'re"", 'happening', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'well', 'defined', 'acted', 'Who', 'Can', 'Kill', 'Child', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'even', 'violence', 'little', 'tykes', 'was', 'unnerving', 'feeling', 'exploitative', 'excellent', 'film', 'great', 'addition', 'new', 'Ghost', 'House', 'Underground', 'series', 'Even', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', 'years', 'do', 'check', 'one', 'price', 'do', 'get', 'great', 'release', 'budget', 'audio', 'terrific', 'visuals', 'bit', 'grainy', 'opening', 'do', 'improve', 'make', 'one', 'better', 'discs', 'Lionsgate', 'go', 'film', 'theres', 'also', 'quiet', 'bevy', 'featurettes', 'are', 'better', 'most', 'recommended', 'disc', ""'m"", 'more', 'movie', 'anything', 'else']",N/A

Anyway....I like a good horror flick as much as the next person so this one got reviews good enough to deem it at least watchable. I popped that baby into the DVD player and I was very satisfied.A couple and their kids (one being a teenager) go to visit friends way out in the English countryside during the Christmas/New Year's holiday. Things start off well enough but one and then more of the younger children seem to start getting sick. It's not obvious right away but as the illness progresses and spreads the kids start getting more uncontrollable, and what, at first glance, seems to be accidents happening in their presence turns into outright hostility and killing.This movie was shot very well. The serenity of the setting was well juxtaposed with the craziness of the escalating storyline. It was directed well enough. I suppose my main concern was not knowing the subtext. What was the director trying to say? There were some vague references to abortion, Chinese viruses/ medicine and the different way the two families chose to raise their kids and run their households. This was exacerbated by the fact I couldn't make out some of the dialogue. I have a very good surround system and either the movie's sound wasn't mixed well or I simply couldn't work the British accents. But one way or the other some important things got past me.What IS good is the way the movie escalates. I'm sure most of us know how unnerving it can be when you have a group of young kids running around, screaming and crying. This goes right to the bones of a lot of people. Now add to that some horrible accidents happening and the resulting confusion about what is actually going on. Add to that the cold, isolation and seemingly innocence of the children and the dial on the creepiness factor climbs way up.This isn't a great movie I suppose but overall it achieves the desired effect.

1269090,A1TU06ANCFKAJZ,B002I41KKA,GODFREY H.,"[5, 6]","The Children is a brilliant, low-budget, intimate horror from the UK that delivers its shocks and sense of dread in bright winter sunlight, in dazzlingly lit rooms full of glittering Xmas cheer, inside a beautiful country house. It amounts to a superb evocation of family breakdown in the face of crisis (I disagree with a reviewer who wanted a more explanatory history of the virus; even the microscope-eye-view of the multiplying viral culprit was unnecessary). The irritating young upper-middle-class professionals get their come-uppance, as it were, for paying so little attention to their children and are compelled (by their unwillingness to face up to their own realities) to blame one another for the domestic apocalypse breeding around them and specifically to accuse the astute and intuitive Casey, the teenage daughter who IS paying attention and sees exactly what's happening, but whose burgeoning sexuality is more than the ""adults"" want to acknowledge (especially Chloe, who doesn't like the dubious attention her husband is giving Casey). Hannah Tointon's hypnotising performance as Casey is the anchor of the movie - she's clearly going to be a major screen actress in years to come. But all the performances are great, although a lot of women viewers (not to mention we gay men) will be disappointed that mega-hunky Jeremy Sheffield (SPOILER COMING UP!) meets such an early and horrifying end. Ultimately the movie suggests that the ""adults"" are the ones behaving like untrustworthy children, while the actual kids are in the thrall of a kind of viral anomie and bewilderment that can only express itself in rage at the world they've been born into. A deeply unsettling and stunningly achieved movie. And it's full of brief but telling details - a viewer on IMDB has observed, for example, that Casey's ""foetal"" tattoo is a reproduction of the cover art for Sigur Ros's 'Agaetis Byrjun'.One caveat re the US DVD - is it just me, or are some of the Special Features promised on the box - 'Snow Set design'/ 'Inside Tom Shankland's Lair'/ 'Micro video featuring In This Moment' - not repeat NOT among the actual Special Features available on the disc????",5,superb movie but... extras?,1257379200,"11 5, 2009",2009,2169,"['Children', 'brilliant', 'low-budget', 'intimate', 'horror', 'UK', 'shocks', 'sense', 'dread', 'bright', 'winter', 'sunlight', 'dazzlingly', 'lit', 'rooms', 'full', 'glittering', 'Xmas', 'cheer', 'beautiful', 'country', 'house', 'superb', 'evocation', 'family', 'breakdown', 'face', 'crisis', 'disagree', 'reviewer', 'who', 'wanted', 'more', 'explanatory', 'history', 'virus', 'even', 'microscope-eye-view', 'multiplying', 'viral', 'culprit', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'irritating', 'young', 'upper-middle-class', 'professionals', 'get', 'come-uppance', 'were', 'paying', 'so', 'little', 'attention', 'children', 'are', 'compelled', 'unwillingness', 'face', 'up', 'own', 'realities', 'blame', 'one', 'domestic', 'apocalypse', 'breeding', 'specifically', 'accuse', 'astute', 'intuitive', 'Casey', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'who', 'paying', 'attention', 'exactly', 'what', 'happening', 'burgeoning', 'sexuality', 'more', 'adults', 'want', 'acknowledge', 'especially', 'Chloe', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', 'dubious', 'attention', 'husband', 'giving', 'Casey', 'Hannah', 'Tointon', 'hypnotising', 'performance', 'Casey', 'anchor', 'movie', 'clearly', 'going', 'be', 'major', 'screen', 'actress', 'years', 'come', 'performances', 'are', 'great', 'lot', 'women', 'viewers', 'not', 'mention', 'gay', 'men', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'mega-hunky', 'Jeremy', 'Sheffield', 'SPOILER', 'COMING', 'UP', 'meets', 'such', 'early', 'horrifying', 'end', 'Ultimately', 'movie', 'adults', 'are', 'ones', 'behaving', 'untrustworthy', 'children', 'actual', 'kids', 'are', 'thrall', 'kind', 'viral', 'anomie', 'bewilderment', 'can', 'only', 'express', 'rage', 'world', ""'ve"", 'been', 'born', 'deeply', 'unsettling', 'stunningly', 'achieved', 'movie', 'full', 'brief', 'telling', 'details', 'viewer', 'IMDB', 'observed', 'example', 'Casey', 'foetal', 'tattoo', 'reproduction', 'cover', 'art', 'Sigur', 'Ros', ""'Agaetis"", ""Byrjun'.One"", 'caveat', 're', 'US', 'DVD', 'just', 'are', 'Special', 'Features', 'promised', 'box', 'Set', ""design'/"", 'Tom', 'Shankland', ""Lair'/"", 'video', 'featuring', 'Moment', 'not', 'repeat', 'NOT', 'actual', 'Special', 'Features', 'available', 'disc']",N/A

First, usually when children turn out to be evil killers the viewer is given some history and development as how this could take place. In this case there was none - no explanation; just kids being killers except at the end some kids that had no connection with the entire movie appear out of nowhere and stand like little zombies in a forest. That's it! Producers are thinking - money sequel.(2.) Second, the story is totally unbelievable in showing parents as easily misled and then overpowered by nine year olds. There is some unclear suggestion that one or more of the kids can telepathically control the other kids - boring old '60s ripoff, and if so why not control the parents! Vague, script writing.(3.) Third, no horror in a horror story! The filming and editing was so poor that you see nothing horrific happening until the event is over and then you see little e.g. a cat is the first to go (another idea ripoff) but all you see is a collar and a bit of blood on the ground; mom gets her ending with a pencil through the eye but unless you stop frame the movie to see those prosthetic 2 seconds you don't see her again; dad gets a hook in the head and what you get is a bloody body lying on the ground for a couple of minutes and if you stop frame the movie you get 3 seconds of prosthetic scalp pulled away; another dad dies in a car and you see nothing except the standard broken windshield and a bit of blood on the ground.(4.)

What starts off as a normal vacation turns into a hectic battle for survival as the children snap and start attacking the adults.The story starts off hinting at an illness as vomiting occurs, the family pet goes missing, and the children act unusually aggressive. The children become more and more aggressive until a brutal ""accident"" occurs, then hell breaks loose. The parents are delusional and refuse to believe the children are responsible. So, they are skeptical and refuse to defend themselves - kids will be kids, right? The parents are slowly, and violently picked off, and their corpses are usually further disfigured. However, it doesn't actually explain why the children snapped, aside from being an ambiguous illness. I really like the story of this film, it's like Children of the Corn on steroids.The acting is great from the entire cast. The children are impressive as their characters change over time. They start of playful and happy, and end up deceptive and violent. You'll hate these kids for doing such an amazing job. It really is frustrating and infuriating. Some of the parents are completely delusional - blind to what is happening before their eyes. I think the adult actors did a good job portraying these feelings, although some was overacted. The makeup is great yet disturbing; the film is very graphic, bloody, and effective. In fact, it was unexpected considering how vivid the violence is when it involves the children. The music is also suitable, although a bit forgettable. The pace is ferocious, it'll be over before you know it.Overall, The Children is a great, brutal horror film; a film that'll make you look at children differently. It is very entertaining, and a great update to the psycho children genre. I recommend a purchase for fans of the genre, a rental otherwise.The Children has strong violence and blood.",4,"...a great, brutal horror film; a film that'll make you look at children differently...",1369872000,"05 30, 2013",2013,1988,"['holidays', 'family', 'get-together', 'brings', 'two', 'sisters', 'together', 'husbands', 'young', 'children', 'one', 'teenager', 'What', 'off', 'normal', 'vacation', 'hectic', 'battle', 'survival', 'children', 'snap', 'start', 'attacking', 'adults.The', 'story', 'hinting', 'illness', 'vomiting', 'occurs', 'family', 'pet', 'missing', 'children', 'act', 'unusually', 'aggressive', 'children', 'become', 'more', 'more', 'aggressive', 'brutal', 'accident', 'occurs', 'then', 'hell', 'breaks', 'loose', 'parents', 'are', 'delusional', 'refuse', 'believe', 'children', 'are', 'responsible', 'So', 'are', 'skeptical', 'refuse', 'defend', 'kids', 'will', 'be', 'kids', 'right', 'parents', 'are', 'slowly', 'violently', 'picked', 'corpses', 'are', 'usually', 'further', 'disfigured', 'However', ""n't"", 'actually', 'explain', 'why', 'children', 'snapped', 'aside', 'being', 'ambiguous', 'illness', 'really', 'story', 'film', 'Children', 'Corn', 'steroids.The', 'acting', 'great', 'entire', 'cast', 'children', 'are', 'impressive', 'characters', 'change', 'time', 'start', 'playful', 'happy', 'end', 'up', 'deceptive', 'violent', ""'ll"", 'hate', 'kids', 'doing', 'such', 'amazing', 'job', 'really', 'frustrating', 'infuriating', 'parents', 'are', 'completely', 'delusional', 'blind', 'what', 'happening', 'eyes', 'think', 'adult', 'actors', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'feelings', 'was', 'overacted', 'makeup', 'great', 'yet', 'disturbing', 'film', 'very', 'graphic', 'bloody', 'effective', 'fact', 'was', 'unexpected', 'considering', 'how', 'vivid', 'violence', 'when', 'children', 'music', 'also', 'suitable', 'bit', 'forgettable', 'pace', 'ferocious', ""'ll"", 'be', 'know', 'it.Overall', 'Children', 'great', 'brutal', 'horror', 'film', 'film', ""'ll"", 'make', 'look', 'children', 'differently', 'very', 'entertaining', 'great', 'update', 'psycho', 'children', 'genre', 'recommend', 'purchase', 'fans', 'genre', 'rental', 'otherwise.The', 'Children', 'strong', 'violence', 'blood']",N/A

The actors, most of which I'd never heard of, were kind of dull, at least the adults, which may have been more script than casting.  The kids though, they truly were creepy when need be.  I'm not a parent, but I've been in charge of kids before so that part of the film resonated with me.  The fact that these kids start attacking the parents starts to get into your head after a while.Yes, the plotting is ridiculously slow.  Yes, there are moments of screaming at the tv in frustration.  Yes, you will probably wonder what the point of the movie is after a while.  But, The Children is actually half decent for an indie film with probably little budget.  It will get into your head because it's kids and kids can do creepy things even when you want to protect them.  I kind of actually liked this movie even if other people are panning it.

1269096,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B002I41KKA,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[2, 3]","THE CHILDREN, a British horror film about murderous -- wait for it -- children, may not have many surprises up its sleeve, but surprisingly adept execution and plotting keep it from devolving into derivative schlock.  The story follows two families that have gathered at a large home in the snowy woods for fun and frivolity.  Unfortunately, the tots start to vomit (vanilla pudding, it would seem) and then come up with some games that happen to be fun even AFTER someone loses an eye.Tom Shankland's script does a great job of establishing the subtle rivalries, flirtations, and complicatons between the two couples and the sole teenager -- an observant, resourceful, and reliably surly girl named Casey -- without taking too long or being obvious about it.  There are a few cheap scare tactics -- brief hallucinatory images accompanied by screeching sounds, an overuse of creepyHalloween-esque music -- but the meat of the horror comes from the juxtaposition of obviously lethal children with parents who can't (more likely won't) comprehend what they're dealing with.The film is not without its flaws.  Anytime your script relies this heavily on the acting abilities of children, some of them no more than toddlers, your bound to run into a few snags unless you manage to find the nextHaley Joel Osment.  Likewise, there's some vague nonsense about viruses bandied about, perhaps as an oblique explanation for the change in the children, but it's half-hearted, and the movie would've worked much better had the creators decided to leave that part of the story up to the viewers to decide.  Add in some sloppy editing and a single, cheesy image at the ending, and you've got a movie that doesn't trust its own staying power.It has it, though, in spite of its various pulled punches.

The gore effects are quite good though.  I don't agree at all that this is a terrible movie. In fact it's a quite horrible idea that your kids would kill you at that age. And this explains how parents would be easy prey for killer kids.  They wouldn't believe it till it was too late.  The acting is quite decent and this british film has nothing to be ashamed about.  It's hard for me to rate a decent horror movie badly when it's low budget. What do viewers expect when they buy low budget horror? Masterpieces of cinema?  A few become that but to be fair how many A movies are bad and they have lots of money? The violence when it comes is pretty graphic and this movie is not for children. It takes about half the movie for the violence to start but who cares?  Movies tell a story and not every horror movie can be fast moving action fests. Those are fine too; but movies are NOT video games and I don't expect insant gratification from them.  So for me I enjoyed this movie and was creeped out by it quite nicely.

A family get together turns deadly when a virus infects the young children, which subsequently causes them to attack and murder the adults. As they fight for survival, it becomes clear that director Tom Shankland (The Killing Gene) is quite simply going for the throat of the viewer, as he pulls no punches in presenting some shocking scenes of brutality and bloodletting. Not to mention the fact that the film is actually suspenseful and it features a simply dynamite ending, The Children winds up being a blood-curdling shocker.

Shankland's movie is not as good as either of those, and because those films were both so good, I have a hard time believing that the shortcomings here were the result of studio interference; still, that's a possibility one must take into account when approaching a film by a Hollywoodized director from overseas. Maybe the studio decided to rip out everything from the first half of the movie that would have made it coherent...Plot (as far as I could tell): a family heads to the mountains for a Christmas vacation to spend time with relatives: mom Elaine (&lt;em>Wake Wood&lt;/em>'s Eva Birthistle) is the matriarch of the travelling family, while her sister Chloe (&lt;em>Lagaan&lt;/em>'s Rachel Shelley) owns the destination house. Between the two families, there are five children, one of whom, Paulie (William Howes in his screen debut), has been feeling unwell since getting a vaccine shot earlier in the day. As the night progresses, Paulie gets more and more fractious, and by the next day, well, he's positively murderous. And what he's got seems to be catching...once we get to the survival-horror aspect of the movie, all the pieces fall into place and this becomes a fast-paced thriller that works more often than not (there is some fiery debate about the final scene that there doesn't need to be--if you've paid enough attention, what's going on in that last shot is obvious). And I'm certain that at some point in the movie's development, the first half of it was just as good, but it seems as if either the script or the dailies got eviscerated at some point. Kudos to the folks trying to defend the first half of this film for being at atmospheric character-building exercise. If it actually were that, I'd be giving kudos to the film as well, and to be sure there are little threads where you can see, if you squint, where pieces of what must have been an admirable whole remain. But there are far too many obvious holes for it to be effective in that regard as is. Which doesn't make the film not worth watching; just expect to have some trouble figuring out what's going on for a bit. ** ",3,"The first half was chopped too much, but the second works well.",1347321600,"09 11, 2012",2012,2609,"['lt', 'strong', '>', 'Children', 'lt', '>', 'Tom', 'Shankland', '2008', 'British', 'TV', 'director', 'Shankland', 'second', 'feature', '2007', 'lt', '>', 'Killing', 'Gene', 'lt', '>', 'got', 'picked', 'up', 'America', 'Ghost', 'House', 'Pictures', 'can', 'be', 'career-killer', 'domestically', 'even', 'finest', 'directors', 'Spanish', 'auteur', 'Nacho', 'Cerd', 'aacute', '2006', 'film', 'lt', '>', 'Abandoned', 'lt', '>', 'was', 'Ghost', 'Housed', 'Pang', 'Brothers', '2008', 'film', 'lt', '>', 'Messengers', 'lt', '>', 'got', 'same', 'treatment', 'are', 'painfully', 'aware', 'Shankland', 'movie', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'films', 'were', 'so', 'good', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'believing', 'shortcomings', 'here', 'were', 'result', 'studio', 'interference', 'still', 'possibility', 'one', 'must', 'take', 'account', 'when', 'approaching', 'film', 'Hollywoodized', 'director', 'overseas', 'Maybe', 'studio', 'decided', 'rip', 'out', 'everything', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'coherent', 'Plot', 'as', 'far', 'could', 'tell', 'family', 'mountains', 'Christmas', 'vacation', 'spend', 'time', 'relatives', 'mom', 'Elaine', 'lt', '>', 'Wake', 'Wood', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Eva', 'Birthistle', 'matriarch', 'travelling', 'family', 'sister', 'Chloe', 'lt', '>', 'Lagaan', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Rachel', 'Shelley', 'destination', 'house', 'two', 'families', 'are', 'five', 'children', 'one', 'whom', 'Paulie', 'William', 'Howes', 'screen', 'debut', 'been', 'feeling', 'unwell', 'getting', 'vaccine', 'shot', 'earlier', 'day', 'night', 'Paulie', 'more', 'more', 'fractious', 'next', 'day', 'well', 'positively', 'murderous', 'what', 'got', 'be', 'catching', 'once', 'get', 'survival-horror', 'aspect', 'movie', 'pieces', 'fall', 'place', 'fast-paced', 'thriller', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'fiery', 'debate', 'final', 'scene', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', ""'ve"", 'paid', 'enough', 'attention', 'what', 'going', 'last', 'shot', 'obvious', ""'m"", 'certain', 'point', 'movie', 'development', 'first', 'half', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'script', 'dailies', 'got', 'eviscerated', 'point', 'Kudos', 'folks', 'trying', 'defend', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'being', 'atmospheric', 'character-building', 'exercise', 'actually', 'were', ""'d"", 'be', 'giving', 'kudos', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'sure', 'are', 'little', 'threads', 'where', 'can', 'see', 'squint', 'where', 'pieces', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'admirable', 'whole', 'remain', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'obvious', 'holes', 'be', 'effective', 'regard', 'Which', ""n't"", 'make', 'film', 'not', 'worth', 'watching', 'just', 'expect', 'have', 'trouble', 'figuring', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'bit', '**']",N/A

Be afraid, very, very afraid of the children. Watch out for when your child begins to throw up. The cast did a fine job of acting, especially the children actors. The adults are typical stupid parents that can't believe there is anything wrong with their precious children and they pay the price. The only smart one is teen daughter Casey. As they say, there are none so blind as those that choose not to see. Overall, this film kept me interested. I think it will keep you interested too.",4,Well done!

There is some rather bloody stuff here, with the kids becoming killers and not realizing it or being able to help it.I just wish we had known a bit more about how they got infected and how others were getting it too. This is never explained.
