892215,A10DQWWRKGQ6FY,B0007WFUBU,"Eric B. Gordon ""The greatest thing we ever ha...","[6, 6]","This is a special on the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge which I didn't catch until approximately twelve years after it was produced (in 1995).  When first I saw it, I was trying not to expect anything, what with my loyalty to the 1981 documentary by Ken Burns (his first ever).  However, I did find this one a highly enjoyable documentary, informative and including plenty of common ties with the earlier special, plus some other nuggets of information (such as the role the Brooklyn Bridge played in the merger of the 5 Boroughs).I only give it four stars out of five, because I do feel the conveyance of historical accounts worked better with the dramatic role-playing of the earlier bridge documentary (Paul Roebling, Arthur Miller, etc).  However, the historians' interviews and the one with Kristian Roebling do give the depiction of the saga a great, human element.  (Kristian is a descendent of John A. Roebling (the bridge designer) and his son, Washington A. Roebling (the builder).)",4,It paints a picture,1233014400,"01 27, 2009",2009,997,"['special', 'construction', 'Brooklyn', 'Bridge', 'did', ""n't"", 'catch', 'approximately', 'twelve', 'years', 'was', 'produced', '1995', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'was', 'trying', 'not', 'expect', 'anything', 'what', 'loyalty', '1981', 'documentary', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'first', 'ever', 'However', 'did', 'find', 'one', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'documentary', 'informative', 'including', 'plenty', 'common', 'ties', 'earlier', 'special', 'other', 'nuggets', 'information', 'such', 'role', 'Brooklyn', 'Bridge', 'played', 'merger', '5', 'Boroughs', 'only', 'give', 'four', 'five', 'do', 'feel', 'conveyance', 'historical', 'accounts', 'worked', 'better', 'dramatic', 'role-playing', 'earlier', 'bridge', 'documentary', 'Paul', 'Roebling', 'Arthur', 'Miller', 'etc', 'However', 'historians', 'interviews', 'one', 'Kristian', 'Roebling', 'do', 'give', 'depiction', 'saga', 'great', 'human', 'element', 'Kristian', 'descendent', 'John', 'A.', 'Roebling', 'bridge', 'designer', 'son', 'Washington', 'A.', 'Roebling', 'builder']",Modern Marvels: Brooklyn Bridge
