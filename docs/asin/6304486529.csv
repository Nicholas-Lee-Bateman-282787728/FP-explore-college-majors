425286,A1A4DEENGHK51T,6304486529,Alan Attebery,"[1, 1]","For what it's worth, this movie can be enjoyable. Much like the TV series, you have to take this movie with a grain of salt. Don't expect to much and you won't be disappointed.The special effects for this sequel do not come close to those of the first movie. The Turbo Megazord kind of looks like a few rejects from the junkyard got together and walked out. And the scenes of the lava pit in Maligore's will remind you of one of those bad B-grade TV Sci-Fi series that were prevalent during the 60s and 70s.One of the bright spots of this movie is Divitox, a new evil villaness played deliciously over-the-top by Hilary Turner. Never taking herself too seriously, Ms. Turner camps up Divitox just enough to make us almost want to route for her to win. Hands down, Divitox is the best villaness (or villan for that matter) to hit Angel Grove in years.Fans of the TV series will appreciate the fact that this movie picks up roughly where the series ended the season, and the series picks up roughly where the movie ends. This is contrary to the first movie which had nothing to do with the TV series except for the fact that it was about the Power Rangers.As I stated earlier, don't expect much and you will be able to enjoy this movie. It can be a lot of fun, and all the action in Maligore's cave at the end of the movie is well worth the pain it takes to get there.",3,Turbo: A Power Rangers Dud,1023494400,"06 8, 2002",2002,1366,"['what', 'worth', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'Much', 'TV', 'series', 'have', 'take', 'movie', 'grain', 'salt', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed.The', 'special', 'effects', 'sequel', 'do', 'not', 'come', 'close', 'first', 'movie', 'Turbo', 'Megazord', 'kind', 'looks', 'few', 'rejects', 'junkyard', 'got', 'together', 'walked', 'out', 'scenes', 'lava', 'pit', 'Maligore', 'will', 'remind', 'one', 'bad', 'B-grade', 'TV', 'Sci-Fi', 'series', 'were', 'prevalent', '60s', '70s.One', 'bright', 'spots', 'movie', 'Divitox', 'new', 'evil', 'villaness', 'played', 'deliciously', 'over-the-top', 'Hilary', 'Turner', 'Never', 'taking', 'too', 'seriously', 'Ms.', 'Turner', 'up', 'Divitox', 'just', 'enough', 'make', 'almost', 'want', 'route', 'win', 'Hands', 'down', 'Divitox', 'best', 'villaness', 'villan', 'matter', 'hit', 'Angel', 'Grove', 'years.Fans', 'TV', 'series', 'will', 'appreciate', 'fact', 'movie', 'up', 'roughly', 'where', 'series', 'ended', 'season', 'series', 'up', 'roughly', 'where', 'movie', 'contrary', 'first', 'movie', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'TV', 'series', 'fact', 'was', 'Power', 'Rangers.As', 'stated', 'earlier', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'lot', 'fun', 'action', 'Maligore', 'cave', 'end', 'movie', 'well', 'pain', 'get', 'there']",Turbo: Power Rangers VHS

So I made notes of my favorite parts as well as those that were worse in my opinion.The Worst:1. Justin - I hated this kid. A preteen a Power Ranger? It's bad enough Jason left. But Rocky was replaced by this kid? I don't know who the worse Power Ranger replacement was - this kid, Aisha or both. Speaking of replacements, I have to say this for people who don't know or don't remember. This was it for Alpha 5 and Zordon. They were replaced with a hipper Alpha 6 and Dimitria. Alpha 6 was nothing compared to Alpha 5 and when ti comes to Power Ranger mentors, no one touches Zordon. It was also it for Adam, Tanya, Katherine, and Tommy, who were replaced by TJ, Carlos, Ashley, Cassie. The new faces were good. But not as good as Tanya, Kat, Adam, and Tommy. Rocky was great. But as as great as Jason. Tommy, Jason, Kim, Trini, Zack, Billy, and Adam were the best to this day in my opinion.2. The plot - Wasn't really good. Divatox, a wicked galactic pirate wants to wed with a powerful demon creature named Maligore, who looks so identical to Dark Specter. That was even pointed out in the Power Rangers In Space series by Divatox herself!3. Cars - If the cars were nothing more than what the Zeo Cycles were for the Zeo Rangers, then I wouldn't have a problem with the cars. But cars transforming into a Megazord? Kinda ridiculous if you ask me lol.My Favorite Parts:1. Kim & Jason return - It was nice to see two original Rangers return. Though would've been better if they all came. Rita & Zedd have a small cameo too.2. Bulk & Skull - Funny as always.3. The karate tournament match (the last scene) - When you have Tommy, Jason or Adam in anything involving karate, you are guaranteed pure awesomeness at its absolute best!4. Music - Not as good as MMPR music. But still quite good.Do I like PRT? Yeah. Just not as much as Zeo and especially not as much as MMPR. As for this movie? It has its ups and downs. It's pretty cheap now if you wanna buy it. But if you can see it for free, I suggest you take that route instead.",4,SHIFT INTO TURBO,1335139200,"04 23, 2012",2012,2150,"[""'ve"", 'wanted', 'review', 'no', 'longer', 'had', 'VHS', 'was', 'not', 'able', 'now', 'aired', 'TV', 'recently', 'made', 'notes', 'favorite', 'parts', 'as', 'well', 'were', 'worse', 'opinion.The', 'Worst:1', 'Justin', 'hated', 'kid', 'preteen', 'Power', 'Ranger', 'bad', 'enough', 'Jason', 'left', 'Rocky', 'was', 'replaced', 'kid', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'worse', 'Power', 'Ranger', 'replacement', 'was', 'kid', 'Aisha', 'Speaking', 'replacements', 'have', 'say', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'was', 'Alpha', '5', 'Zordon', 'were', 'replaced', 'hipper', 'Alpha', '6', 'Dimitria', 'Alpha', '6', 'was', 'nothing', 'compared', 'Alpha', '5', 'when', 'ti', 'Power', 'Ranger', 'mentors', 'one', 'Zordon', 'was', 'also', 'Adam', 'Tanya', 'Katherine', 'Tommy', 'who', 'were', 'replaced', 'TJ', 'Carlos', 'Ashley', 'Cassie', 'new', 'were', 'good', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Tanya', 'Kat', 'Adam', 'Tommy', 'Rocky', 'was', 'great', 'as', 'great', 'Jason', 'Tommy', 'Jason', 'Kim', 'Trini', 'Zack', 'Billy', 'Adam', 'were', 'best', 'day', 'opinion.2', 'plot', 'Was', ""n't"", 'really', 'good', 'Divatox', 'wicked', 'galactic', 'pirate', 'wed', 'powerful', 'demon', 'creature', 'named', 'Maligore', 'who', 'so', 'identical', 'Dark', 'Specter', 'was', 'even', 'pointed', 'out', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'Space', 'series', 'Divatox', '3', 'Cars', 'cars', 'were', 'nothing', 'more', 'what', 'Zeo', 'Cycles', 'were', 'Zeo', 'Rangers', 'then', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'cars', 'cars', 'transforming', 'Megazord', 'Kinda', 'ridiculous', 'ask', 'lol.My', 'Favorite', 'Parts:1', 'Kim', 'Jason', 'return', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'two', 'original', 'Rangers', 'return', 'Though', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'came', 'Rita', 'Zedd', 'have', 'small', 'cameo', 'too.2', 'Bulk', 'Skull', 'Funny', 'always.3', 'karate', 'tournament', 'match', 'last', 'scene', 'When', 'have', 'Tommy', 'Jason', 'Adam', 'anything', 'involving', 'karate', 'are', 'guaranteed', 'pure', 'awesomeness', 'absolute', 'best', '4', 'Music', 'Not', 'as', 'good', 'MMPR', 'music', 'still', 'quite', 'good.Do', 'like', 'PRT', 'Yeah', 'Just', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'Zeo', 'especially', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'MMPR', 'movie', 'ups', 'downs', 'pretty', 'cheap', 'now', 'wan', 'buy', 'can', 'see', 'free', 'suggest', 'take', 'route', 'instead']",Turbo: Power Rangers VHS
425289,AMICVV9N2U2R4,6304486529,Atli Hafsteinsson,"[2, 9]","I love Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers: The Movie, some good clean fun, but this movie is just embarrassing, and nowhere near as fun.The plot centres around an extraterrestrial wizard named Lerigot, who goes to Earth in order to avoid capture by a crazed alien queen, Divatox (no, seriously). She plans to use Lerigot to open up a portal so that she can marry an evil dark creature, Maligore, and unite their powers. Naturally, the Power Rangers must stop this.Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie is nowhere near as much fun or cool to watch as the first movie. Most notably, Aisha and Billy are completely missing, with no explanation, and Kimberly is no longer a Power Ranger either for some reason, even though she has an important part in the film, thankfully, along with old regular Jason. Rocky is technically there, but he suffers an injury at the start of the film, as if trying to get him out of it, which is sad. Then we have a new blue ranger, Justin, who really is much too young to be a Ranger.A more serious problem is the Zords. The whole mythology around the Power Rangers is much lamer here. The Zords are no longer kinds of animals, they are now all cars, called ""Turbo"" powers, which just feels nowhere near as imaginative. At a pivotal point of the film, the car Zords merge into what I find hard to describe as anything but a Transformers rip-off. Even worse than that, though, is the fact that the Power Rangers, in Power Ranger form, have so little screen time.Furthermore, the plot is terribly paced, and not very fun to follow. The Rangers have to travel to another dimension via an old pirate ship. Seriously? In the first half hour, a lot of time is wasted with the Rangers trying to find Lerigot, and some insufferable scenes of him wandering around the jungle. Nothing hangs together at all. Remember how central the very concept of being a Power Ranger was to the first movie? Here, it feels like little more than a gimmick.Lerigot is a body-sized puppet who looks like an extra from The Dark Crystal. With his wide doe eyes and nonsensical slurring, he gets on your nerves very quickly, and he just does not stop. The rest of the supporting cast is just as bad. Divatox's henchmen are just laughably embarrassing, especially the insufferable Elgar. Remember Goldar, and Mordant? Those were entertaining henchmen. Maligore, for a supposed unstoppable force of evil, is incredibly ungainly and ineffective. Divatox herself is amusing and Hilary Shephard Turner clearly has a lot of fun with the role, but her overacting gets a little over the top. All the puns are so self-conscious as if the writer were self-aware how bad it would turn out. The special effects are much poorer than in the first movie, too, especially Zordon (he barely looks like he's talking) and Maligore's crater (amateur bluescreen mistake there). Thank goodness Alpha is as good as ever.The best part of the movie is an amusing cameo from Rita and Lord Zedd. That's about a minute in length, and it made the movie for me. Too bad that the rest isn't as fun to watch. Not even having Kimberly and Jason there can help, really. There's none of the spirit of adventure from the first movie. Do yourself a favour and pass this one up, you're not really missing anything. Watch Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers instead.",1,Power Rangers + Transformers + Magic Crystal: let me think about that for a minute... no,1308441600,"06 19, 2011",2011,3305,"['love', 'Mighty', 'Morphin', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'Movie', 'good', 'clean', 'fun', 'movie', 'just', 'embarrassing', 'nowhere', 'fun.The', 'plot', 'extraterrestrial', 'wizard', 'named', 'Lerigot', 'who', 'Earth', 'order', 'avoid', 'capture', 'crazed', 'alien', 'queen', 'Divatox', 'seriously', 'use', 'Lerigot', 'open', 'up', 'portal', 'can', 'marry', 'evil', 'dark', 'creature', 'Maligore', 'unite', 'powers', 'Naturally', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'must', 'stop', 'this.Turbo', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'Movie', 'nowhere', 'near', 'much', 'fun', 'cool', 'watch', 'first', 'movie', 'Most', 'notably', 'Aisha', 'Billy', 'are', 'completely', 'missing', 'explanation', 'Kimberly', 'no', 'longer', 'Power', 'Ranger', 'reason', 'even', 'important', 'part', 'film', 'thankfully', 'old', 'regular', 'Jason', 'Rocky', 'technically', 'there', 'injury', 'start', 'film', 'trying', 'get', 'sad', 'Then', 'have', 'new', 'blue', 'ranger', 'Justin', 'who', 'really', 'much', 'too', 'young', 'be', 'Ranger.A', 'more', 'serious', 'problem', 'Zords', 'whole', 'mythology', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'much', 'lamer', 'here', 'Zords', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'kinds', 'animals', 'are', 'now', 'cars', 'called', 'Turbo', 'powers', 'just', 'feels', 'nowhere', 'imaginative', 'pivotal', 'point', 'film', 'car', 'Zords', 'merge', 'what', 'find', 'hard', 'describe', 'anything', 'Transformers', 'rip-off', 'Even', 'worse', 'though', 'fact', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'Power', 'Ranger', 'form', 'have', 'so', 'little', 'screen', 'time.Furthermore', 'plot', 'terribly', 'paced', 'not', 'very', 'fun', 'follow', 'Rangers', 'have', 'travel', 'dimension', 'old', 'pirate', 'ship', 'Seriously', 'first', 'half', 'hour', 'lot', 'time', 'wasted', 'Rangers', 'trying', 'find', 'Lerigot', 'insufferable', 'scenes', 'wandering', 'jungle', 'Nothing', 'together', 'Remember', 'how', 'central', 'very', 'concept', 'being', 'Power', 'Ranger', 'was', 'first', 'movie', 'Here', 'little', 'more', 'gimmick.Lerigot', 'body-sized', 'puppet', 'who', 'extra', 'Dark', 'Crystal', 'wide', 'doe', 'eyes', 'nonsensical', 'slurring', 'nerves', 'very', 'quickly', 'just', 'not', 'stop', 'rest', 'supporting', 'cast', 'just', 'bad', 'Divatox', 'henchmen', 'are', 'just', 'laughably', 'embarrassing', 'especially', 'insufferable', 'Elgar', 'Remember', 'Goldar', 'Mordant', 'were', 'entertaining', 'henchmen', 'Maligore', 'supposed', 'unstoppable', 'force', 'evil', 'incredibly', 'ungainly', 'ineffective', 'Divatox', 'amusing', 'Hilary', 'Shephard', 'Turner', 'clearly', 'lot', 'fun', 'role', 'overacting', 'little', 'top', 'puns', 'are', 'so', 'self-conscious', 'writer', 'were', 'self-aware', 'how', 'bad', 'would', 'turn', 'out', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'much', 'poorer', 'first', 'movie', 'too', 'especially', 'Zordon', 'barely', 'talking', 'Maligore', 'crater', 'amateur', 'bluescreen', 'mistake', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'Alpha', 'as', 'good', 'ever.The', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'amusing', 'cameo', 'Rita', 'Lord', 'Zedd', 'minute', 'length', 'made', 'movie', 'Too', 'bad', 'rest', ""n't"", 'as', 'fun', 'watch', 'Not', 'even', 'having', 'Kimberly', 'Jason', 'can', 'help', 'really', 'none', 'spirit', 'adventure', 'first', 'movie', 'Do', 'favour', 'pass', 'one', 'up', ""'re"", 'not', 'really', 'missing', 'anything', 'Watch', 'Mighty', 'Morphin', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'instead']",Turbo: Power Rangers VHS

425295,A239PPUVV8O0U0,6304486529,D. A. Reed,"[1, 1]","I didn't see this one in theatres like the first one. I wasn't even aware that there was a sequel until the Turbo season was well under way. Gone are the PVC/metal costumes and CGI Zords. In this big screen season premiere (this one actally leads into the beginning of the new season) we lose the second Mighty Morphin Red Ranger/Blue Zeo Ranger Rocky (due to a real-life injury from the Zeo season) and what do we gain? Is it a worthy successor like he was for Jason? Absolutely not! We get a kid! This is one of two things that bothered me. Like I said in a previous review, they included a twelve-year old so the kids at home could have someone to identify with. While every kid who was into the original series did want to be a Ranger (myself included), my suspension of disbelief couldn't believe it. Maybe if the producers hadn't made David Yost (Billy) upset during the Zeo season because they reduced his role causing his departure, maybe he could've made a triumphant return as the Blue Ranger again. Second, I was never a fan of the switch to cars as the Zords over animals, it just looks bland and unimaginative. I also don't get why they had to switch to the Turbo powers anyway. Were Divatox's forces far too powerful for them? Or was Kat's fall into the water just too much of a strain on the Zeo Crystal? At any rate, a little explaination, as others have said, would've been nice. However the positive outways the negative. Divatox was such a great villain, reminding me of Rita Repulsa (who makes a cameo with husband Lord Zedd and tries to give the newbie a bit of advice, only to fall on deaf ears). She's far more enjoyable than the Machine Empire from the Zeo season though Hilary Shepard Turner, who plays her in the film with energy and wit and would return later in the season, exits on maternity leave and is replaced by Carol Hoyt for the majority of the Turbo season (though Hoyt was good, Turner was better as she's the one I saw first. Not much of a reason but its mine). The return of Jason and Kimberly was welcome but it was a shame they really didn't get in on the action as much as I would've liked (despite the fact that they do become evil and get to beat the Rangers). And look for the Maligore costume to resurface during Power Rangers in Space, only instead he'll be called Dark Spectre (even Divatox mentions the similarity). All in all, it was an enjoyable film that kept me entertained. Sadly, not even Divatox was enough, as Turbo would prove to be the last season of the series I watched on a regular basis, as they switched out the senior Rangers for newer, blander (though I did like TJ and Carlos) characters and I was growing tired (and older) of the repetitive plots. But from what I hear, many kids who grew up with series stopped watching either before, during or after Turbo, which has garned the distinction of being the season that almost got Power Rangers cancelled.",4,A Worthy Follow Up,1240617600,"04 25, 2009",2009,2921,"['did', ""n't"", 'see', 'one', 'theatres', 'first', 'one', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'aware', 'was', 'sequel', 'Turbo', 'season', 'was', 'well', 'way', 'Gone', 'are', 'PVC/metal', 'costumes', 'CGI', 'Zords', 'big', 'screen', 'season', 'premiere', 'one', 'actally', 'beginning', 'new', 'season', 'lose', 'second', 'Mighty', 'Morphin', 'Red', 'Ranger/Blue', 'Zeo', 'Ranger', 'Rocky', 'due', 'real-life', 'injury', 'Zeo', 'season', 'what', 'do', 'gain', 'worthy', 'successor', 'was', 'Jason', 'Absolutely', 'not', 'get', 'kid', 'one', 'two', 'things', 'bothered', 'said', 'previous', 'review', 'included', 'twelve-year', 'old', 'kids', 'home', 'could', 'have', 'someone', 'identify', 'kid', 'who', 'was', 'original', 'series', 'did', 'want', 'be', 'Ranger', 'included', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Maybe', 'producers', 'had', ""n't"", 'made', 'David', 'Yost', 'Billy', 'upset', 'Zeo', 'season', 'reduced', 'role', 'causing', 'departure', 'maybe', 'could', ""'ve"", 'made', 'triumphant', 'return', 'Blue', 'Ranger', 'again', 'Second', 'was', 'never', 'fan', 'switch', 'cars', 'Zords', 'animals', 'just', 'bland', 'unimaginative', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'why', 'had', 'switch', 'Turbo', 'powers', 'anyway', 'Were', 'Divatox', 'forces', 'far', 'too', 'powerful', 'was', 'Kat', 'fall', 'water', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'strain', 'Zeo', 'Crystal', 'rate', 'little', 'explaination', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'nice', 'However', 'positive', 'negative', 'Divatox', 'was', 'such', 'great', 'villain', 'reminding', 'Rita', 'Repulsa', 'who', 'cameo', 'husband', 'Lord', 'Zedd', 'tries', 'give', 'newbie', 'bit', 'advice', 'only', 'fall', 'deaf', 'ears', 'far', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'Machine', 'Empire', 'Zeo', 'season', 'Hilary', 'Shepard', 'Turner', 'who', 'film', 'energy', 'wit', 'would', 'return', 'later', 'season', 'exits', 'maternity', 'leave', 'replaced', 'Carol', 'Hoyt', 'majority', 'Turbo', 'season', 'Hoyt', 'was', 'good', 'Turner', 'was', 'better', 'one', 'saw', 'first', 'Not', 'much', 'reason', 'mine', 'return', 'Jason', 'Kimberly', 'was', 'welcome', 'was', 'shame', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'action', 'as', 'much', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'fact', 'do', 'become', 'evil', 'get', 'beat', 'Rangers', 'look', 'Maligore', 'costume', 'resurface', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'Space', 'only', 'instead', ""'ll"", 'be', 'called', 'Dark', 'Spectre', 'even', 'Divatox', 'similarity', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'kept', 'entertained', 'Sadly', 'not', 'even', 'Divatox', 'was', 'enough', 'Turbo', 'would', 'prove', 'be', 'last', 'season', 'series', 'watched', 'regular', 'basis', 'switched', 'out', 'senior', 'Rangers', 'newer', 'blander', 'did', 'like', 'TJ', 'Carlos', 'characters', 'was', 'growing', 'tired', 'older', 'repetitive', 'plots', 'what', 'hear', 'many', 'kids', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'series', 'stopped', 'watching', 'Turbo', 'garned', 'distinction', 'being', 'season', 'almost', 'got', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'cancelled']",Turbo: Power Rangers VHS

But this movie signals for me the moment where the Power Rangers lost their cool, and it's considered by some to be the moment the franchise ""jumped the shark,"" when characters and powers started to become easily interchangable, beginning a process that nowadays sees a new team of Power Rangers, new powers, new Zords, and new villains each and every season.Unlike Might Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie, which was an independent ""alternate universe"" story that didn't attempt to connect itself to the events of the television show, Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie serves as a direct bridge between Season 4 (Power Rangers Zeo) and Season 5 (Power Rangers Turbo), explaining the events that occur between these seasons.An evil space pirate named Divatox is looking for a couple human sacrifices to bring her long lost love (a giant lava beast) to life, choosing two retired Power Rangers from series' past, Kimberly and Jason (Amy Jo Johnson and Austin St. John, the original Pink and Red Rangers from the first season) and it's up to the current team of spandex-wearing heroes to rescue them and defeat Divatox. But before they can do that, they need all-new Turbo Powers with matching Turbo Zords to make sure they're up to the task.And that's where the movie loses me. In previous seasons, the Power Rangers never needed new Powers until they were defeated and/or their previous powers were destroyed. In Season 4, the Power Rangers acquired new Zeo Powers after their old powers are destroyed, an event that was built up and hyped during Season 3 quite effectively. But in this movie, the much-hyped Zeo powers have suddenly been deemed inadequate for fighting Divatox.They don't even so much as attempt to fight her with their Zeo powers, they just go ahead and make new ""Turbo"" powers. In previous seasons of the show, the powerless Rangers would often need to fulfill some task or go on some quest in search of a new power source or new Zords. But if they can simply make new and improved powers out of the blue, then why haven't they done it previously in the show? Wouldn't it have been a lot easier to do that than to go on some quest?And why are Ranger powers so abundant anyway? Everytime the Rangers lose their powers, there's always a new power source that allows them to become Rangers again. Instead of having just five or six Rangers, why not gather all the various power sources and put together a Ranger army? I know, I'm thinking way too much into this for a kid's show, but this stuff does run through your mind when you realize how long the Power Rangers have been around.Another thing that puts me off about this movie is the introduction of a child as a new Power Ranger. Granted, all the Rangers are supposed to be kids, they're normal high school students when they're not fighting monsters. But none of them have been fresh out of elementary school when they became Power Rangers until now. However, this isn't a complete precedent. The Super Sentai series, the Japanese inspiration and originator of the United States' Power Rangers brand, included a child Ranger in one of their seasons. But it's done in Turbo as a blatant attempt to draw in younger viewers since the core of the Power Rangers audience (like me) was growing up and becoming teenagers. This backfired on them, as the older viewers were put off by it and tuned out.In the end, it's a kid's movie. The costumes and effects are on par with the television series, a contrast from the first movie's redesigned armor-like costumes and splashier special effects. And it is more or less a very long toy commercial, but these new toys don't feel as cool as the previous ones. What's cool about riding around in Zord that's just an oversized car when you can pilot a giant robotic T-Rex or Dragon Zord instead? Well, at least this movie will distract your kids for a little while anyway.",2,Here's where the Power Rangers franchise started going downhill,1247270400,"07 11, 2009",2009,4046,"['watched', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'battle', 'evil', 'weekdays', 'Saturday', 'mornings', 'elementary', 'school', 'years', 'yes', 'did', 'stick', 'show', 'when', 'was', 'middle', 'school', 'movie', 'signals', 'moment', 'where', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'lost', 'cool', 'considered', 'be', 'moment', 'franchise', 'jumped', 'shark', 'when', 'characters', 'powers', 'started', 'become', 'easily', 'interchangable', 'beginning', 'process', 'new', 'team', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'new', 'powers', 'new', 'Zords', 'new', 'villains', 'season.Unlike', 'Might', 'Morphin', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'Movie', 'was', 'independent', 'alternate', 'universe', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'attempt', 'connect', 'events', 'television', 'show', 'Turbo', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'Movie', 'direct', 'bridge', 'Season', '4', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'Zeo', 'Season', '5', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'Turbo', 'explaining', 'events', 'occur', 'seasons.An', 'evil', 'space', 'pirate', 'named', 'Divatox', 'looking', 'couple', 'human', 'sacrifices', 'bring', 'long', 'lost', 'love', 'giant', 'lava', 'beast', 'life', 'choosing', 'two', 'retired', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'series', 'past', 'Kimberly', 'Jason', 'Amy', 'Jo', 'Johnson', 'Austin', 'St.', 'John', 'original', 'Pink', 'Red', 'Rangers', 'first', 'season', 'up', 'current', 'team', 'spandex-wearing', 'heroes', 'rescue', 'defeat', 'Divatox', 'can', 'do', 'need', 'all-new', 'Turbo', 'Powers', 'matching', 'Turbo', 'Zords', 'make', 'sure', ""'re"", 'up', 'task.And', 'where', 'movie', 'previous', 'seasons', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'never', 'needed', 'new', 'Powers', 'were', 'defeated', 'previous', 'powers', 'were', 'destroyed', 'Season', '4', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'acquired', 'new', 'Zeo', 'Powers', 'old', 'powers', 'are', 'destroyed', 'event', 'was', 'built', 'up', 'hyped', 'Season', '3', 'quite', 'effectively', 'movie', 'much-hyped', 'Zeo', 'powers', 'have', 'suddenly', 'been', 'deemed', 'inadequate', 'fighting', 'Divatox.They', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'so', 'much', 'attempt', 'fight', 'Zeo', 'powers', 'just', 'go', 'ahead', 'make', 'new', 'Turbo', 'powers', 'previous', 'seasons', 'show', 'powerless', 'Rangers', 'would', 'often', 'need', 'fulfill', 'task', 'go', 'quest', 'search', 'new', 'power', 'source', 'new', 'Zords', 'can', 'simply', 'make', 'new', 'improved', 'powers', 'blue', 'then', 'why', 'have', ""n't"", 'done', 'previously', 'show', 'Would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'easier', 'do', 'go', 'quest', 'why', 'are', 'Ranger', 'powers', 'so', 'abundant', 'anyway', 'Everytime', 'Rangers', 'lose', 'powers', 'always', 'new', 'power', 'source', 'become', 'Rangers', 'again', 'Instead', 'having', 'just', 'five', 'six', 'Rangers', 'why', 'not', 'gather', 'various', 'power', 'sources', 'put', 'together', 'Ranger', 'army', 'know', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'kid', 'show', 'stuff', 'run', 'mind', 'when', 'realize', 'how', 'long', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'have', 'been', 'around.Another', 'thing', 'off', 'movie', 'introduction', 'child', 'new', 'Power', 'Ranger', 'Granted', 'Rangers', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'kids', ""'re"", 'normal', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'when', ""'re"", 'not', 'fighting', 'monsters', 'none', 'have', 'been', 'fresh', 'elementary', 'school', 'when', 'became', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'now', 'However', ""n't"", 'complete', 'precedent', 'Super', 'Sentai', 'series', 'Japanese', 'inspiration', 'originator', 'United', 'States', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'brand', 'included', 'child', 'Ranger', 'one', 'seasons', 'done', 'Turbo', 'blatant', 'attempt', 'draw', 'younger', 'viewers', 'core', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'audience', 'was', 'growing', 'up', 'becoming', 'teenagers', 'backfired', 'older', 'viewers', 'were', 'put', 'off', 'tuned', 'end', 'kid', 'movie', 'costumes', 'effects', 'are', 'par', 'television', 'series', 'contrast', 'first', 'movie', 'redesigned', 'armor-like', 'costumes', 'splashier', 'special', 'effects', 'more', 'less', 'very', 'long', 'toy', 'commercial', 'new', 'toys', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'as', 'cool', 'previous', 'ones', 'What', 'cool', 'riding', 'around', 'Zord', 'just', 'oversized', 'car', 'when', 'can', 'pilot', 'giant', 'robotic', 'T-Rex', 'Dragon', 'Zord', 'instead', 'Well', 'least', 'movie', 'will', 'distract', 'kids', 'little', 'anyway']",Turbo: Power Rangers VHS

First a kid named Justin becomes a Power Ranger after another one is injured and the character and the acting just doesn't cut it.  What also sucks is that Kimberly and Jason from the original Mighty Morphin PRs are there and it is clear that Tommy still have feelings for Kimberly and as a fan of the Tommy/Kimberly romance Kat being there just ruins everything.  Divatox is cool as a villian but doesn't compare to Rita and Ivan Ooze as she is too conceited and superficial which gets annoying after a while.  Overall, at this point the series Power Rangers has changed so much that what made the Power Rangers popular is completely GONE.  I can't even identify with the characters anymore.

Also, with a great plot that was a little better than the first movie and an awesome soundtrack there was just a hint of a little somthing going on with kimberly and jason so hopfully fans of the show will find somthing to talk about and find scenes in there that their gonna end up loving for a long time...my only problem was the end because they spent a fair amout of time on buildup with k/t -{{ remember the end credits anyone? he so wanted to hug her amoung other things}}- and to bring in the kat thing was a bad move, it lacked any feeling what so ever and was just fake in having it in there buy in spite of that I loved it alot.PS- take not as i'm sure one of the only reasons why it ended that way was because with the series 1-3 and this alpha's magical christmas thing that i've just heard about and the stupid ""letter"" that i won't bring up i'm sure that they had it in there because ppl were asking about a possible reunite and it wasn't going to happen whick s#cks!

425323,A6DM1B2370X1Y,6304486529,RockinRobin411,"[3, 4]","I mean that about Power Rangers in general, even after seeing the Super Sentai series of which Power Rangers is based on.  Every couple of years at least, I go through this big Power Ranger crazy phase (it goes basically from Mighty Morphin Power Rangers season 1 to Power Rangers in Space, but I also enjoy Power Rangers Lost Galaxy, which is how I got into it).  I don't know exactly what it is, but I'm guessing that it's because it's just good fun, but it can get pretty epic, yet it's still not completely serious.Now, I feel that the Power Rangers Turbo television show wasn't as good as the previous shows in many ways.  I feel that Power Rangers Turbo was more of a transitional show with some good episodes here and there.  I really liked many of the subplots from episodes of the show.What do I think of the movie?  The movie is the opposite of the television series in my personal opinion.  While the show had a several really good subplots about the Rangers' personal lives, but wasn't as good a show, the film is great.  It's not exactly the opposite because there is a subplot about a karate competition where the award is a check that is planned to be donated to the orphanage, but one of them, who also happens to be the Blue Ranger, breaks his back.Meanwhile, there's a wizard from another planet who has a key that can open many dimensional gateways, and he's being chased by an awesome villain, Divatox (she's not as evil as King Mondo, Rita Repulsa, or Lord Zedd but she's sure a lot more entertaining).  I really like Divatox's henchmen, but again, they're nowhere near as evil as the Machine Empire or Rita and Zedd's henchmen.  These villains are much more comical, but they're also very different from the previous villains.  While the Machine Empire and Rita and Zedd were more epic villains, Divatox seems a bit more like an underground sort of villain, but that might be because she's working underwater.The film is about Divatox's attempt to use a wizard's magical key to free a giant beast from where he had been trapped centuries ago.  The Power Rangers create new powers to go on a journey to stop Divatox, and because Rocky, the Blue Ranger, has broken his back, they get a new Blue Ranger.  When overhearing a the Power Rangers being contacted by their leader, Justin, a twelve year old boy, is chosen to be the Blue Ranger.  One of the things I like about one of the scenes, and one of the episodes of Power Rangers Turbo, is the way they develop the relationship between Justin and Kat, the Pink Ranger.  Don't worry, it's not like that; it's in some ways more like a mother son type of relationship.The film also includes the return of probably the two most popular original Power Rangers.  Jason was the original Red Ranger, and had recently become the Gold Ranger in Power Rangers Zeo.  Kimberly was the original Pink Ranger, and developed an extremely serious relationship with Tommy, originally the Green Ranger, but now the Red Ranger.  In Zeo, she sent Tommy a letter telling him that she had fallen in love with someone else, but that Tommy would always be a good friend, so there isn't really anything in that area.  Also, Tommy already is with Kat.Now, how does this film compare to Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie?  Well, Ivan Ooze is one of my favorite villains, but I'll admit that part of it is that he's the only villain that wasn't part of the shows or anything, so there really isn't much of him.  Ivan Ooze is a much more epic villain than Divatox, but Divatox has two things that Ivan Ooze doesn't have, and she's much more comedic.  Ivan Ooze had funny moments, but Divatox had a much more over-the-top personality.Some other things about this film in comparison to the other Power Rangers movie is that this film was part of the continuity.  The other film redesigned Lord Zedd, Rita Repulsa, and Goldar, got rid of Finster, Squatt, and Baboo, and added this pig-like creature.  With that film, they also redesigned the Power Rangers suits, and in my personal opinion, it was for the worst.  With Turbo, the film happens right between Power Rangers Zeo and Power Rangers Turbo, instead of in a rewritten world.One of the things I really like about Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie is that, from what I understand, it doesn't use any Super Sentai footage, and it doesn't use any of the episodes of Super Sentai Carranger for inspiration.  It's the same with Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie, but I still prefer Turbo.Overall, I really like Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie because it's mainly entertaining.",5,A huge guilty pleasure of mine,1252886400,"09 14, 2009",2009,4568,"['mean', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'general', 'even', 'seeing', 'Super', 'Sentai', 'series', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'based', 'Every', 'couple', 'years', 'least', 'go', 'big', 'Power', 'Ranger', 'crazy', 'phase', 'basically', 'Mighty', 'Morphin', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'season', '1', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'Space', 'also', 'enjoy', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'Lost', 'Galaxy', 'how', 'got', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'exactly', 'what', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'just', 'good', 'fun', 'can', 'get', 'pretty', 'epic', 'still', 'not', 'completely', 'serious.Now', 'feel', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'Turbo', 'television', 'show', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'previous', 'shows', 'many', 'ways', 'feel', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'Turbo', 'was', 'more', 'transitional', 'show', 'good', 'episodes', 'here', 'there', 'really', 'liked', 'many', 'subplots', 'episodes', 'show.What', 'do', 'think', 'movie', 'movie', 'opposite', 'television', 'series', 'personal', 'opinion', 'show', 'had', 'several', 'really', 'good', 'subplots', 'Rangers', 'personal', 'lives', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'show', 'film', 'great', 'not', 'exactly', 'opposite', 'subplot', 'karate', 'competition', 'where', 'award', 'check', 'planned', 'be', 'donated', 'orphanage', 'one', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'Blue', 'Ranger', 'back.Meanwhile', 'wizard', 'planet', 'who', 'key', 'can', 'open', 'many', 'dimensional', 'gateways', 'being', 'chased', 'awesome', 'villain', 'Divatox', 'not', 'as', 'evil', 'King', 'Mondo', 'Rita', 'Repulsa', 'Lord', 'Zedd', 'sure', 'lot', 'more', 'entertaining', 'really', 'Divatox', 'henchmen', 'again', ""'re"", 'nowhere', 'near', 'as', 'evil', 'Machine', 'Empire', 'Rita', 'Zedd', 'henchmen', 'villains', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'comical', ""'re"", 'also', 'very', 'different', 'previous', 'villains', 'Machine', 'Empire', 'Rita', 'Zedd', 'were', 'more', 'epic', 'villains', 'Divatox', 'bit', 'more', 'underground', 'sort', 'villain', 'might', 'be', 'working', 'underwater.The', 'film', 'Divatox', 'attempt', 'use', 'wizard', 'magical', 'key', 'free', 'giant', 'beast', 'where', 'had', 'been', 'trapped', 'centuries', 'ago', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'create', 'new', 'powers', 'go', 'journey', 'stop', 'Divatox', 'Rocky', 'Blue', 'Ranger', 'broken', 'back', 'get', 'new', 'Blue', 'Ranger', 'When', 'overhearing', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'being', 'contacted', 'leader', 'Justin', 'twelve', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'chosen', 'be', 'Blue', 'Ranger', 'One', 'things', 'like', 'one', 'scenes', 'one', 'episodes', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'Turbo', 'way', 'develop', 'relationship', 'Justin', 'Kat', 'Pink', 'Ranger', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'not', 'ways', 'more', 'mother', 'son', 'type', 'relationship.The', 'film', 'also', 'return', 'probably', 'two', 'most', 'popular', 'original', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'Jason', 'was', 'original', 'Red', 'Ranger', 'had', 'recently', 'become', 'Gold', 'Ranger', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'Zeo', 'Kimberly', 'was', 'original', 'Pink', 'Ranger', 'developed', 'extremely', 'serious', 'relationship', 'Tommy', 'originally', 'Green', 'Ranger', 'now', 'Red', 'Ranger', 'Zeo', 'sent', 'Tommy', 'letter', 'telling', 'had', 'fallen', 'love', 'someone', 'else', 'Tommy', 'would', 'always', 'be', 'good', 'friend', ""n't"", 'really', 'anything', 'area', 'Also', 'Tommy', 'already', 'Kat.Now', 'how', 'film', 'compare', 'Mighty', 'Morphin', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'Movie', 'Well', 'Ivan', 'Ooze', 'one', 'favorite', 'villains', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'part', 'only', 'villain', 'was', ""n't"", 'part', 'shows', 'anything', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'Ivan', 'Ooze', 'much', 'more', 'epic', 'villain', 'Divatox', 'Divatox', 'two', 'things', 'Ivan', 'Ooze', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'more', 'comedic', 'Ivan', 'Ooze', 'had', 'funny', 'moments', 'Divatox', 'had', 'much', 'more', 'over-the-top', 'personality.Some', 'other', 'things', 'film', 'comparison', 'other', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'movie', 'film', 'was', 'part', 'continuity', 'other', 'film', 'redesigned', 'Lord', 'Zedd', 'Rita', 'Repulsa', 'Goldar', 'got', 'rid', 'Finster', 'Squatt', 'Baboo', 'added', 'pig-like', 'creature', 'film', 'also', 'redesigned', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'suits', 'personal', 'opinion', 'was', 'worst', 'Turbo', 'film', 'right', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'Zeo', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'Turbo', 'instead', 'rewritten', 'world.One', 'things', 'really', 'Turbo', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'Movie', 'what', 'understand', ""n't"", 'use', 'Super', 'Sentai', 'footage', ""n't"", 'use', 'episodes', 'Super', 'Sentai', 'Carranger', 'inspiration', 'same', 'Mighty', 'Morphin', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'Movie', 'still', 'prefer', 'Turbo.Overall', 'really', 'Turbo', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'Movie', 'mainly', 'entertaining']",Turbo: Power Rangers VHS
