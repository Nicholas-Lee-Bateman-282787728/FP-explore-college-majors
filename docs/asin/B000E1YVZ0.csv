966301,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000E1YVZ0,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","A few months back I had the privilege of catching Louis Malle's masterful `Au Revoir Les Enfants' and I was immediately smitten.  His command of the material is nearly flawless, and his inspired subject matter is as heartbreaking as it is heartwarming.  He has the ability to transcend the boundaries of film by presenting the audience with a complex moral debate, and `Lacombe, Lucien' is no exception.  Just as haunting, but slightly less commanding, `Lacombe, Lucien' is an extremely well crafted character study that is as controversial as it is important.The film takes place during the summer of 1944 in a small town in France.  A young teen named Lucien attempts to join the resistance but is rejected due to his age.  Feeling betrayed and embittered Lucien makes a grave choice; to turn his back on his friends and join the Gestapo.  Never fully understanding the weight of his decisions, Lucien lives his new life like it were a right, taking what he feels he deserves and holding his power over the heads of those in his way.  He forms a relationship of sorts with a Jewish tailor and his beautiful daughter, whom Lucien takes a liking to.  His morals are conflicted by his new situation, and his choices thereafter cause a huge rift in his life.Delicately directed, `Lacombe, Lucien' is a very graceful film, despite its dark subject.  It flows fluidly, never dragging or testing our patience.  The weight of the material is always felt, but it never becomes a burden as Malle knows well how to balance out the darkness with the light.My one slight concern with the film falls in the line of Lucien himself.  Pierre Blaise (who looks a lot like a young Ray Liotta) is not an actor (or at least he wasn't at the time) and while he possesses an odd naturalness that compliments his character, he also lacks the technical proficiency that would have elevated his character.  There are moments of silence that would have been drastically uplifted had he known what to do with his face, but instead Blaise wears the same mask of indifference throughout the film.  This is effective during the films center scenes, where his head is big and his cruelty is dominant; but as the film closes and his emotional conflictions become the films focus I was put off by Blaise's lack of depth.Fairing much greater are Aurore Clement and Holger Lowenadler.  Lowenadler is fascinating as Albert.  He captures this mans desire to reach this child without contaminating his daughter in the process, and Clement is marvelous as France, allowing the actions of Lucien to affect her personally.  She wears her every emotion clear to us.  We can see her mix of disgust and fascination as she battles her own attraction to Lucien.  It's a very intimate and effective performance.In the end the film is fascinating to say the least.  The script is brilliantly written.  It flows masterfully, complete with a beautiful rise and fall that keeps us glued to the seat.  One is left with many questions to ask about their own feelings and beliefs.

966302,A1AC9S8U66SNMU,B000E1YVZ0,Buenoslibros.es,"[7, 7]","Very interesting film, and technically perfect. It captures the attention from start to finish, although it becomes a little agravating in its middle part because of the inactivity of its main character.Beautiful exterior locations in the southwest of France during the weeks following the landing in Normandy of the British and American troops. A young country kid, very good at hunting and domestic chores, is rejected by the local teacher and leader of the resistence. Knowing no better he enrolls in the German police and becomes a collaborator. The role of Lucien is played by a non professional, and he does great. His naturalness couldn't be achieved otherwise. But I think the director didn't give him enough lines. Lucien is too quiet -unnaturally quiet-, too inactive. This becomes agravating through the middle section of the film when you wish he would do something, either way good or worse. But the story lingers as it is stuck with the Jewish taylor and his daughter. They seem to be feeling the same as the viewer: ""What's up with you? Do something!""It's almost 2 and a half hours of film, not 70 odd minutes as it says above. Not the best Malle movie (which to me is 'Au revoir les enfants', also during the German occupation of France), but it is a great movie.It's an excellent study of characters, universal characters. It poses the question whether this simple young kid could be blamed for what he did by those who refused to accept him for the cause of the resistence. But then, who would we blame? If we start forgiving him, we'd end forgiving everyone, then justice would be so relativistic it would have no sense even defending oneself. It would be anarchy, the law of the stronger. Well, this is the kind of debate ir arises, because Lucien is a likable fellow, although simple.",4,Collaboration in France from an understanding point of view,1169769600,"01 26, 2007",2007,1805,"['Very', 'interesting', 'film', 'technically', 'perfect', 'attention', 'start', 'finish', 'little', 'agravating', 'middle', 'part', 'inactivity', 'main', 'character.Beautiful', 'exterior', 'locations', 'southwest', 'France', 'weeks', 'following', 'landing', 'Normandy', 'British', 'American', 'troops', 'young', 'country', 'kid', 'very', 'good', 'hunting', 'domestic', 'chores', 'rejected', 'local', 'teacher', 'leader', 'resistence', 'Knowing', 'better', 'German', 'police', 'collaborator', 'role', 'Lucien', 'played', 'non', 'professional', 'great', 'naturalness', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'achieved', 'otherwise', 'think', 'director', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'enough', 'lines', 'Lucien', 'too', 'quiet', '-unnaturally', 'quiet-', 'too', 'inactive', 'agravating', 'middle', 'section', 'film', 'when', 'wish', 'would', 'do', 'something', 'way', 'good', 'worse', 'story', 'lingers', 'stuck', 'Jewish', 'taylor', 'daughter', 'seem', 'be', 'feeling', 'same', 'viewer', 'What', 'up', 'Do', 'something', 'almost', '2', 'half', 'hours', 'film', 'not', '70', 'odd', 'minutes', 'Not', 'best', 'Malle', 'movie', ""'Au"", 'revoir', 'enfants', 'also', 'German', 'occupation', 'France', 'great', 'movie.It', 'excellent', 'study', 'characters', 'universal', 'characters', 'question', 'simple', 'young', 'kid', 'could', 'be', 'blamed', 'what', 'did', 'who', 'refused', 'accept', 'cause', 'resistence', 'then', 'who', 'would', 'blame', 'start', 'forgiving', ""'d"", 'end', 'forgiving', 'everyone', 'then', 'justice', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'relativistic', 'would', 'have', 'sense', 'even', 'defending', 'would', 'be', 'anarchy', 'law', 'stronger', 'Well', 'kind', 'debate', 'ir', 'arises', 'Lucien', 'likable', 'fellow', 'simple']","Lacombe, Lucien"

966304,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,B000E1YVZ0,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[4, 4]","Every so often a director makes an inspiring casting choice to not hire a real actor for a role, but go with an unknown, an amateur. Perhaps the best example of this was in Vittorio De Sica's 1952 film Umberto D., wherein he cast Carlo Battisti, a retired college professor from the University of Florence, as the lead character. Yet, not that far behind has to be Louis Malle's decision to caste the lead character for his 1974 film, Lacombe, Lucien with an amateur named Pierre Blaise. No actor would likely be able to capture the natural ferality that Blaise brings to the role of a none too bright French farm boy who unwittingly, at first, becomes an accomplice and collaborator with the Gestapo in the final months of Vichy France, in late 1944.He is not evil, even though the film abounds with moments of animal cruelty that seem to delight both the actor and character to such a degree that separating the two of them is nearly an impossible task. Then there is the utter grunting stolidity that Blaise brings to the role. Any real actor would likely have gone over the top, trying to `make a scene' where the film dictates the character need only be in the margins of the scene. And, the truth is that there is little to be had from each scene. The screenplay is assured but minimal, but that feels right, as we sort of wander through scene after scene of evil and violence with the same lack of bearing that Blaise/Lacombe does....In some ways, Lacombe has much in common with Stanley Kubrick's thuggish Little Alex, from A Clockwork Orange, save that he is more restrained and realistic. He also never really changes in the film- he starts and ends the tale as an impassive and predatory Sphinx who could have easily become a Resistance hero as a Vichy thug, if only his bicycle's back tire had not blown out near the local Vichy leaders' home. Perhaps this is why Albert tells him that, despite his abuse of his family, `Somehow I can't bring myself to completely despise you.' Neither can the viewer of this film, which is why the complex and probing Malle is a much better filmmaker than the obvious and often preachy works of his New Wave rivals, Jean-Luc Godard and Franois Truffaut. But, I need not even state such a case, when his films do all the talking necessary.

This is a fascinating character study since director Louis Malle resists any contrivance to make the boy sympathetic or reduce his complexity to some easily understood platitude.  Unwelcome at home, he seems to be largely motivated by an understandable desire to belong to some group, yet we also see, right from the beginning, his casual cruelty to animals.  It may seem heartless for the local leader of the Resistance to reject his request to join the struggle, but when we see the ease with which he abuses his power later, we are forced to conclude that it may have been the correct decision.  In the end, when he appears to be acting more morally, is it really motivated by the pangs of conscience or is it a thoughtless shifting of allegiance to avoid being alone?

Thus, this film can be seen as more a precursor of films like ""Good Fellas"" than ""Schindler's List"".  It's the simple story of a boy who falls in with a gang of thugs--who in this case are the German police.Pierre Blaise was an excellent and brave choice to play the boy, Lucien, because Blaise was an untrained and untried actor of seventeen.  The raw crudeness he brings to the character is authentic--Blaise, according to observers, was unsure of himself and resentful of the film crew.  He truly ""did not like being talked down to"", both in the film and in real life.  With his guarded expressions, clumsy attempts at being a 'tough guy', and inarticulateness, Blaise nearly resembles a very young version of Charles Bronson.Lucien, of course, is a character who is not fully formed into adulthood, and this sets up the central tension in the film, which is a kind of Faustian struggle for his soul.  The angel of Lucien's ""better nature"" is his Jewish girlfriend, ""France"", played by Aurore Clement.  Clement brings a fresh-faced beauty (equal to present day actress Gwyneth Paltrow's) to her character, who holds out the possibility of freeing up Lucien's emotions.In the final frames, Clement and Blaise flee to the countryside and cavort in brief, fleeting glimpses of idyllic bliss.  Like the outlaws in ""Bonnie and Clyde"", the characters are revealed as doomed in these haunting last scenes.Strangely enough, the young actor Pierre Blaise perished in an auto accident only a year after this movie was completed.",5,Essential Viewing,1193356800,"10 26, 2007",2007,1804,"['master', 'touch', 'director', 'Louis', 'Malle', 'work', 'Lacombe', 'Lucien', 'one', 'best', 'yet', 'apparently', 'least', 'venerated', 'films', ""1970's.Malle"", 'masterstroke', 'was', 'approach', 'German', 'gestapo', 'tentacles', 'French', 'collaborators', 'type', 'Mafia', 'organization', 'Thus', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'more', 'precursor', 'films', 'Good', 'Fellas', 'Schindler', 'List', 'simple', 'story', 'boy', 'who', 'gang', 'thugs', 'who', 'case', 'are', 'German', 'police.Pierre', 'Blaise', 'was', 'excellent', 'brave', 'choice', 'play', 'boy', 'Lucien', 'Blaise', 'was', 'untrained', 'untried', 'actor', 'seventeen', 'raw', 'crudeness', 'character', 'authentic', 'Blaise', 'according', 'observers', 'was', 'unsure', 'resentful', 'film', 'crew', 'truly', 'did', 'not', 'being', 'talked', 'down', 'film', 'real', 'life', 'guarded', 'expressions', 'clumsy', 'attempts', 'being', ""'tough"", 'guy', 'inarticulateness', 'Blaise', 'nearly', 'very', 'young', 'version', 'Charles', 'Bronson.Lucien', 'course', 'character', 'who', 'not', 'fully', 'formed', 'adulthood', 'up', 'central', 'tension', 'film', 'kind', 'Faustian', 'struggle', 'soul', 'angel', 'Lucien', 'better', 'nature', 'Jewish', 'girlfriend', 'France', 'played', 'Aurore', 'Clement', 'Clement', 'fresh-faced', 'beauty', 'equal', 'present', 'day', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'character', 'who', 'out', 'possibility', 'freeing', 'up', 'Lucien', 'emotions.In', 'final', 'frames', 'Clement', 'Blaise', 'flee', 'countryside', 'cavort', 'brief', 'fleeting', 'glimpses', 'idyllic', 'bliss', 'outlaws', 'Bonnie', 'Clyde', 'characters', 'are', 'revealed', 'doomed', 'haunting', 'last', 'scenes.Strangely', 'enough', 'young', 'actor', 'Pierre', 'Blaise', 'perished', 'auto', 'accident', 'only', 'year', 'movie', 'was', 'completed']","Lacombe, Lucien"

We learn his father is in prison and his mother has taken up with someone else. Though we never learn about the father's absence, it's likely that it has something to do with the war which may be why Lucien seems to want to be a member of the French Resistance. He tries to join, but is rebuffed by a former teacher who believes he's too young and undisciplined. Lucien has an ambivalent reaction to the rebuff and we assume he'll just continue his employment at the nursing home. The action changes when patrons at a hotel capture Lucien's attention. His curiosity gets him in trouble but ends up being an opportunity. He then becomes involved with the police who are in line with the Gestapo.Pierre Bliase is an excellent Lucien. He's consistent throughout and never gives us a chance to see the character as a lovable ruffian who would be different if is someone cared. Holger Lowenadler plays Albert Horn, a Jewish tailor and the father of Aurore Clement's France, the woman who becomes Lucien's love interest. The Horns accommodate Lucien, but it's unclear as to whether he realizes it is out of convenience and nothing more. Other characters in the film include members of the police who seem like typical turncoats, a middle aged maid who has a brief romantic entanglement with Lucien, and the villagers of Lucien's hometown. Like Malle's AU REVOIR LES ENFANTS, we get a feeling of occupied France toward the end of the war.At the time of its release, the film was somewhat controversial. Only French resisters with noble character made it to the screen. Lucien is anything but noble. He's a misfit who never would have been accepted as a member of the police if it had not been 1944. Anyone with even a glimmer of intelligence knew the American would be liberating France in due time and had changed their loyalties but Lucien is unaware of any reality outside his own world. Malle had originally planned on setting the film in Mexico during a revolution but was unable to film in that country, so he decided that the setting could be France and the story set in the late days of the war. No one would ever guess from viewing the film of these changes which is a testament to the strength of Lucien's character and why the film can be so haunting today as we wonder what causes young people to become terrorists, join gangs, or take the wrong side in struggles that are ultimately against their best interest.",5,A Powerful Film With Great Impact,1148256000,"05 22, 2006",2006,3103,"['LACOMBE', 'LUCIEN', 'assume', ""'ll"", 'like', 'main', 'character', 'find', 'work', 'nursing', 'home', 'take', 'break', 'tedious', 'job', 'washing', 'floors', 'window', 'get', 'glimpse', 'sunny', 'day', 'enjoy', 'beauty', 'small', 'yellow', 'songbird', 'singing', 'tree', 'then', 'see', 'reach', 'pocket', 'take', 'out', 'slingshot', 'kill', 'bird', 'Later', ""'ll"", 'see', 'same', 'rabbits', 'chickens', 'Lucien', 'beginning', 'film', 'one', 'who', 'still', 'see', 'end.LACOMBE', 'LUCIEN', 'directed', 'Louis', 'Malle', 'film', 'story', 'Lucien', 'troubled', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'have', 'few', 'friends', 'not', 'welcome', 'home', 'learn', 'father', 'prison', 'mother', 'taken', 'up', 'someone', 'else', 'never', 'learn', 'father', 'absence', 'likely', 'something', 'do', 'war', 'may', 'be', 'why', 'Lucien', 'want', 'be', 'member', 'French', 'Resistance', 'join', 'rebuffed', 'former', 'teacher', 'who', 'too', 'young', 'undisciplined', 'Lucien', 'ambivalent', 'reaction', 'rebuff', 'assume', ""'ll"", 'just', 'continue', 'employment', 'nursing', 'home', 'action', 'changes', 'when', 'patrons', 'hotel', 'capture', 'Lucien', 'attention', 'curiosity', 'trouble', 'up', 'being', 'opportunity', 'then', 'involved', 'police', 'who', 'are', 'line', 'Gestapo.Pierre', 'Bliase', 'excellent', 'Lucien', 'consistent', 'never', 'chance', 'see', 'character', 'lovable', 'ruffian', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'different', 'someone', 'cared', 'Holger', 'Lowenadler', 'Albert', 'Horn', 'Jewish', 'tailor', 'father', 'Aurore', 'Clement', 'France', 'woman', 'who', 'Lucien', 'love', 'interest', 'Horns', 'accommodate', 'Lucien', 'unclear', 'convenience', 'nothing', 'more', 'Other', 'characters', 'film', 'include', 'members', 'police', 'who', 'seem', 'typical', 'turncoats', 'middle', 'aged', 'maid', 'who', 'brief', 'romantic', 'entanglement', 'Lucien', 'villagers', 'Lucien', 'hometown', 'Malle', 'AU', 'REVOIR', 'LES', 'ENFANTS', 'get', 'feeling', 'occupied', 'France', 'end', 'war.At', 'time', 'release', 'film', 'was', 'somewhat', 'controversial', 'Only', 'French', 'resisters', 'noble', 'character', 'made', 'screen', 'Lucien', 'anything', 'noble', 'misfit', 'who', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'accepted', 'member', 'police', 'had', 'not', 'been', '1944', 'Anyone', 'even', 'glimmer', 'intelligence', 'knew', 'American', 'would', 'be', 'liberating', 'France', 'due', 'time', 'had', 'changed', 'loyalties', 'Lucien', 'unaware', 'reality', 'own', 'world', 'Malle', 'had', 'originally', 'planned', 'setting', 'film', 'Mexico', 'revolution', 'was', 'unable', 'film', 'country', 'decided', 'setting', 'could', 'be', 'France', 'story', 'set', 'late', 'days', 'war', 'one', 'would', 'ever', 'guess', 'viewing', 'film', 'changes', 'testament', 'strength', 'Lucien', 'character', 'why', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'haunting', 'today', 'wonder', 'what', 'young', 'people', 'become', 'terrorists', 'join', 'gangs', 'take', 'wrong', 'side', 'struggles', 'are', 'ultimately', 'best', 'interest']","Lacombe, Lucien"

At his best, he was as good as Bergman-- perhaps even better-- because he was much less a ""dramatist,"" his technique was more invisible, and his penetration into his subject even deeper.  Seen as a group, MURMUR OF THE HEART, LACOMBE LUCIEN, and AU REVOIR LES ENFANTS may be the highest mark the cinema has yet achieved.The link between the last two films is obvious, but why group MURMUR OF THE HEART with the pair of films about the WW2 occupation?  Because stylistically and thematically there is much about them that belongs together.  Malle's subject is the unknowability of the self.  His camera allows us access to  most profound study of human nature in ways that are beyond our ability to conceptualize rationally.  These three films are perhaps the greatest visual poem ever created on the subject of what it means to be human.Miraculously, Malle achieves works of superhuman complexity in a form so simple as to seem almost invisible.In LACOMBE LUCIEN, the story achieves an achingly beautiful tension that culminates in a lyrical sequence which seems to be the blossoming of a new kind of innocence-- and yet, ironically, this very affirmation contains the seeds of its own destruction.  Some may be tempted to dismiss the ending as ""incomplete,""  but if so, it is incomplete in the same way as the ending of ""No Country for Old Men,"" another great and visionary movie.On a technical level, I think LACOMBE LUCIEN may be the single most refined and effective piece of cinematography in film history.  Tonino Delli Colli (known in America primarily for his work with Sergio Leone-- ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST), here merges his craft with Malle's genius for putting the camera in the right place and allowing ""truth"" to seep out of the screen.Equally, the editing of this film achieves a flow and pacing that puts it also on the level of the finest work of Bergman, Fellini, Hitchcock, and Bunuel.But it is Malle's insight and intelligence that plants this film ultimately at the summit of the highest art.Until I saw this film again recently, I usually named RULES OF THE GAME as my candidate for ""greatest film ever made.""I better stop before I exhaust all superlatives.  In the face of genius, perhaps the best one can do is remain silent.  The awe I feel in the face of this film has kept me from doing my best, but if I can convince a few people to experience this work for themselves, then the excesses of these lines will have served some purpose.",5,Louis Malle is one of the very greatest directors;  this is one of his greatest films,1281052800,"08 6, 2010",2010,2521,"['been', 'greater', 'filmmaker', 'Louis', 'Malle', 'best', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'Bergman', 'perhaps', 'even', 'better', 'was', 'much', 'less', 'dramatist', 'technique', 'was', 'more', 'invisible', 'penetration', 'subject', 'even', 'deeper', 'Seen', 'group', 'MURMUR', 'THE', 'HEART', 'LACOMBE', 'LUCIEN', 'AU', 'REVOIR', 'LES', 'ENFANTS', 'may', 'be', 'highest', 'mark', 'cinema', 'yet', 'achieved.The', 'link', 'last', 'two', 'films', 'obvious', 'why', 'group', 'MURMUR', 'THE', 'HEART', 'pair', 'films', 'WW2', 'occupation', 'stylistically', 'thematically', 'much', 'together', 'Malle', 'subject', 'unknowability', 'self', 'camera', 'access', 'most', 'profound', 'study', 'human', 'nature', 'ways', 'are', 'ability', 'conceptualize', 'rationally', 'three', 'films', 'are', 'perhaps', 'greatest', 'visual', 'poem', 'ever', 'created', 'subject', 'what', 'be', 'human.Miraculously', 'Malle', 'works', 'superhuman', 'complexity', 'form', 'so', 'simple', 'seem', 'almost', 'invisible.In', 'LACOMBE', 'LUCIEN', 'story', 'achingly', 'beautiful', 'tension', 'lyrical', 'sequence', 'be', 'blossoming', 'new', 'kind', 'innocence', 'yet', 'ironically', 'very', 'affirmation', 'seeds', 'own', 'destruction', 'may', 'be', 'tempted', 'dismiss', 'ending', 'incomplete', 'so', 'incomplete', 'same', 'way', 'ending', 'No', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'great', 'visionary', 'movie.On', 'technical', 'level', 'think', 'LACOMBE', 'LUCIEN', 'may', 'be', 'single', 'most', 'refined', 'effective', 'piece', 'cinematography', 'film', 'history', 'Tonino', 'Delli', 'Colli', 'known', 'America', 'primarily', 'work', 'Sergio', 'Leone', 'ONCE', 'A', 'TIME', 'IN', 'THE', 'WEST', 'here', 'craft', 'Malle', 'genius', 'putting', 'camera', 'right', 'place', 'allowing', 'truth', 'seep', 'screen.Equally', 'editing', 'film', 'flow', 'pacing', 'also', 'level', 'finest', 'work', 'Bergman', 'Fellini', 'Hitchcock', 'Bunuel.But', 'Malle', 'insight', 'intelligence', 'plants', 'film', 'ultimately', 'summit', 'highest', 'art.Until', 'saw', 'film', 'again', 'recently', 'usually', 'named', 'RULES', 'THE', 'GAME', 'candidate', 'greatest', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'better', 'stop', 'exhaust', 'superlatives', 'face', 'genius', 'perhaps', 'best', 'one', 'can', 'do', 'remain', 'silent', 'awe', 'feel', 'face', 'film', 'kept', 'doing', 'best', 'can', 'convince', 'few', 'people', 'experience', 'work', 'then', 'excesses', 'lines', 'will', 'have', 'served', 'purpose']","Lacombe, Lucien"
966313,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B000E1YVZ0,Trevor Willsmer,"[11, 11]","Louis Malle's Lacombe, Lucien still impresses, although it does tend to amble in the third act just when you might expect it to tighten its grip. But it's still a casually powerful reminder of the less heroic side of France under Vichy rule (the Nazis are barely seen in the film) as its none too bright farmboy just drifts almost accidentally into collaboration with the German Police made up entirely of his compatriots after being turned down for the Resistance. The film's major achievement is in showing, much like fascism in general, the appeal that collaboration had to the disaffected and the underachieving outsiders in the community (only one of the `police' is a real zealot) and the attraction of undeserved and unearned power as Lucien finds the power he has over people (particularly the unspoken threat of handing his Jewish `girlfriend' - perhaps a little over symbolically called `France' - to the Germans) is far more intoxicating than killing mere animals.Throughout, as with Melville's resistance masterpiece L'Armee des Ombres, there's a mundane sense of reality that heightens the drama. Set in the kind of small picturesque village that outsiders find idyllic but which is a tedious hell to live in for the locals, it shows how malaise and opportunity is far more of a driving force than malice. Certainly it's far from glamorous, its collaborators hanging round in a local hotel getting drunk and bemoaning their lot as the war news gets continually worse (as one points out, you have to listen to both the German and the British radio reports ""and split the difference"" to find the truth) and they gradually get picked off by the emboldened locals.The only extra on Criterion's disc is the imaginative theatrical trailer, so this might be worth picking up in Criterion's boxed set which also includes Au Revoir Les Enfants, Murmur of the Heart and an exclusive disc of extras mainly focussing on Louis Malle rather than the films themselves.",5,Evil at its most banal and inadequate,1150070400,"06 12, 2006",2006,1966,"['Louis', 'Malle', 'Lacombe', 'Lucien', 'still', 'tend', 'amble', 'third', 'act', 'just', 'when', 'might', 'expect', 'tighten', 'grip', 'still', 'casually', 'powerful', 'reminder', 'less', 'heroic', 'side', 'France', 'Vichy', 'rule', 'Nazis', 'are', 'barely', 'seen', 'film', 'none', 'too', 'bright', 'farmboy', 'just', 'almost', 'accidentally', 'collaboration', 'German', 'Police', 'made', 'up', 'entirely', 'compatriots', 'being', 'turned', 'down', 'Resistance', 'film', 'major', 'achievement', 'showing', 'much', 'fascism', 'general', 'appeal', 'collaboration', 'had', 'disaffected', 'underachieving', 'outsiders', 'community', 'only', 'one', 'police', 'real', 'zealot', 'attraction', 'undeserved', 'unearned', 'power', 'Lucien', 'power', 'over', 'people', 'particularly', 'unspoken', 'threat', 'handing', 'Jewish', 'girlfriend', 'perhaps', 'little', 'symbolically', 'called', 'France', 'Germans', 'far', 'more', 'intoxicating', 'killing', 'mere', 'animals.Throughout', 'Melville', 'resistance', 'masterpiece', ""L'Armee"", 'Ombres', 'mundane', 'sense', 'reality', 'drama', 'Set', 'kind', 'small', 'picturesque', 'village', 'outsiders', 'find', 'idyllic', 'tedious', 'hell', 'live', 'locals', 'how', 'malaise', 'opportunity', 'far', 'more', 'driving', 'force', 'malice', 'Certainly', 'far', 'glamorous', 'collaborators', 'hanging', 'round', 'local', 'hotel', 'getting', 'drunk', 'bemoaning', 'lot', 'war', 'news', 'continually', 'worse', 'one', 'out', 'have', 'listen', 'German', 'British', 'radio', 'reports', 'split', 'difference', 'find', 'truth', 'gradually', 'get', 'picked', 'off', 'emboldened', 'locals.The', 'only', 'Criterion', 'disc', 'imaginative', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'might', 'be', 'worth', 'picking', 'up', 'Criterion', 'boxed', 'set', 'also', 'Au', 'Revoir', 'Les', 'Enfants', 'Murmur', 'Heart', 'exclusive', 'disc', 'extras', 'mainly', 'focussing', 'Louis', 'Malle', 'rather', 'films']","Lacombe, Lucien"
