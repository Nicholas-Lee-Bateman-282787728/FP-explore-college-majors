Tom Burlinson who starred in both ""The Man from Snowy River"" films and ""Phar Lap: Heart of a Nation"" appears in a supporting role. Irish actor Brendan Gleeson provides a strong screen presence and Stephen Curry and Daniel MacPherson are energetic and poignant.It is a story that wonderfully captures the Australian spirit and persona.Nicholas R.W.

This is a movie based on the true story of the 2002 Melbourne Cup horse race in Australia. After winning the best jockey award for the 4th year in a row Damien Oliver (Curry) surprises everyone, including his brother in announcing he will race for the hated Irish trainer Dermot Weld (Gleeson). After tragedy strikes during the qualifying races for the cup Damien must decide if racing is still for him and if he can regain the spark. I may have to rethink the way I feel about certain movies. I was not interested in seeing ""Seabiscuit"" because it was about horse racing and I really enjoyed that movie. I was still not looking forward to ""Secretariat"" and that movie blew me away with how good it was. For the third time I was really reluctant to see this movie and again I was shocked at how good it was. The movie is pretty cheesy in parts and even the tragedies are kind of glossed over but this is still very much worth watching. Whether you are a horse racing fan or not this is still a very good movie that is very entertaining and a very good watch. I highly recommend this. Overall, pretty cheesy and acting is iffy at best but the fact that this is a true story helps overcome those short-comings and makes it very much worth watching.
