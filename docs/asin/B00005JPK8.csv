They form little gangs that dance against each other like the dancers in Michael Jackson's ""Beat It"". It's a positive step for black youth culture that a film be about black, or urban, youths... Ohh wait a second. Man,__Nevermind__ .I SWEAR TO GOD -- just as I was typing this out on my computer, just NOW, it got to the part where they beat each other up and dude has a gun and kills somebody.

Just substitute stepping (and ""krumping""-the street dancing of the West Coast) with Black marching show bands and you get the idea.The stepping (which the film does NOT acknowledge as having its roots among the gumboots and ""careful treading"" styles of the Zulus of South Africa) and Krump dancing scenes are entertaining. But as for the story, you've seen it all before. Arrogant street punk goes to college and learns the meaning of friendship, love and teamwork, etc. etc.It is true that the only similarities between this film and ""School Daze"" are that stepping is shown (in only one scene in ""School Daze"") and they are both based at fictional Black colleges in Atlanta. The only reason I really liked School Daze THEN was because I was in college at the time and could relate to it. From a perspective of some 20 years, I realize now that it wasn't that hot. This film likewise will find its biggest audience among the college crowd and the hiphoppers.

It just so happened that my wife was sick and in bed this weekend and happened to watch this film simply because there was nothing else on.  I came in about halfway through and it sparked my interest, so I made her rewind and we watched it together.I'd watch it again.The story is very much `Romeo + Juliet' meets `Drumline', with MTV editing and a whole lot of `stank face', but that combination works rather well here.  I wasn't a fan of `Drumline', but this one kept my attention.When DJ's brother is shot and killed, he finds himself living with his aunt and uncle.  Hoping for a better life, with a good education, DJ's uncle pulls some strings and gets him into Truth University.  Immediately, DJ finds that he doesn't quite fit in, or maybe it's that he fits in too well.  He makes rivals with an arrogant `stepper' named Grant who happens to be dating mega-hottie April, who seems to have eyes for DJ.  When DJ is pressured to pledge with the fraternity Grant is a member of, he opts to join his rival, using their tradition of `step' competitions (an aggressive hip-hop, krump-like dance style) as a way to `battle' his new adversary.  All the while, DJ is pining for April's affections, causing issues with DJ's education, especially when her father gets word and pushes to have DJ expelled.But love, and dance, prevail.The storyline is a tad overdone, but it works here thanks to some high intensity dance sequences, some really good acting and some sizzling chemistry.  Columbus Short can dance and act, which is a plus here.  He has a `Vin Deisel' baritone and a smooth delivery (not to mention some modelesque good looks) that makes him rather irresistible, and his screen partner (the ubber-gorgeous Meagan Good) is more than enough hotness to make them a tantalizing couple.  You just WANT to watch them.  Darrin Henson is a pretty bad actor, but he's a convincing dancer, so he's forgivable.  I really liked Brian White here too.  He has a suave yet commanding presence.And then you have the killer dance scenes that just get better and better as the film progresses.Yes, `Stomp the Yard' is brainless at times and even a tad corny (the forced sense of `tension' in the films finale is rather laughable) but it also has rare and unexpected moments of touching and moving `heart' (the ""I love you"" even made my wife go ""WOW"") and for a film claiming to offer a fun, good time, `Stomp the Yard' definitely does what it sets out to do.",4,I actually liked this...,1269216000,"03 22, 2010",2010,2576,"['Yeah', ""'m"", 'kind', 'shocked', 'too', 'mean', 'like', 'stuff', 'sometimes', 'rule', 'usually', 'avoid', 'kinds', 'films', 'just', 'so', 'happened', 'wife', 'was', 'sick', 'bed', 'weekend', 'happened', 'watch', 'film', 'simply', 'was', 'nothing', 'else', 'came', 'halfway', 'sparked', 'interest', 'made', 'rewind', 'watched', 'together.I', ""'d"", 'watch', 'again.The', 'story', 'very', 'much', 'Romeo', '+', 'Juliet', 'meets', 'Drumline', 'MTV', 'editing', 'whole', 'lot', 'stank', 'face', 'combination', 'rather', 'well', 'here', 'was', ""n't"", 'fan', 'Drumline', 'one', 'kept', 'attention.When', 'DJ', 'brother', 'shot', 'killed', 'living', 'aunt', 'uncle', 'Hoping', 'better', 'life', 'good', 'education', 'DJ', 'uncle', 'strings', 'Truth', 'University', 'Immediately', 'DJ', ""n't"", 'quite', 'fit', 'maybe', 'too', 'well', 'rivals', 'arrogant', 'stepper', 'named', 'Grant', 'who', 'be', 'dating', 'mega-hottie', 'April', 'who', 'have', 'eyes', 'DJ', 'When', 'DJ', 'pressured', 'pledge', 'fraternity', 'Grant', 'member', 'join', 'rival', 'using', 'tradition', 'step', 'competitions', 'aggressive', 'hip-hop', 'krump-like', 'dance', 'style', 'way', 'battle', 'new', 'adversary', 'while', 'DJ', 'pining', 'April', 'affections', 'causing', 'issues', 'DJ', 'education', 'especially', 'when', 'father', 'word', 'pushes', 'have', 'DJ', 'expelled.But', 'love', 'dance', 'prevail.The', 'storyline', 'tad', 'overdone', 'here', 'thanks', 'high', 'intensity', 'dance', 'sequences', 'really', 'good', 'acting', 'sizzling', 'chemistry', 'Columbus', 'Short', 'can', 'dance', 'act', 'plus', 'here', 'Vin', 'Deisel', 'baritone', 'smooth', 'delivery', 'not', 'mention', 'modelesque', 'good', 'looks', 'rather', 'irresistible', 'screen', 'partner', 'ubber-gorgeous', 'Meagan', 'Good', 'more', 'enough', 'hotness', 'make', 'tantalizing', 'couple', 'just', 'WANT', 'watch', 'Darrin', 'Henson', 'pretty', 'bad', 'actor', 'convincing', 'dancer', 'forgivable', 'really', 'liked', 'Brian', 'White', 'here', 'too', 'suave', 'yet', 'commanding', 'presence.And', 'then', 'have', 'killer', 'dance', 'scenes', 'just', 'get', 'better', 'better', 'film', 'progresses.Yes', 'Stomp', 'Yard', 'brainless', 'times', 'even', 'tad', 'corny', 'forced', 'sense', 'tension', 'films', 'finale', 'rather', 'laughable', 'also', 'rare', 'unexpected', 'moments', 'touching', 'moving', 'heart', 'love', 'even', 'made', 'wife', 'go', 'WOW', 'film', 'claiming', 'offer', 'fun', 'good', 'time', 'Stomp', 'Yard', 'definitely', 'what', 'out', 'do']",Stomp the Yard

She is pissed, that black folks have smarten up.  By the way, Betty Boo, pissed is a Black American expression. In addition, the mainstream uses this word everyday, as if they created it.

The best thing about it is when it touched on history of university educated Black men and women, so for that alone I am giving 3 stars.  The rest of the movie rated lower in my opinion.I thought the story was trite and had a lot of holes in it.  But who cares, that is secondary to wanting to see the Stomping.  Some of the dance scenes were good but there is a lot of flashing light so you can't even see the real action -- not a good sign.  The big ending seems unrealistic, does a fraternity really put together a rock star show with smoke and blacklights?  The ending scene reminded me of -- horrors -- the disney movie, Jump In.  In fact, the story line in Stomp the Yard is a lot like Jump In, just more corny and fake.  The only good thing was the honor of the guys in the fraternity.  But everyone else is a scumbucket, even the university leaders, that's weak.If you want to see a really really good movie with hot moves and poignancy try The ATL (also set in Atlanta).  ATL also has a guy going to college.  The love story is similar but better told.  The moves are more real, and I have never seen the team skate thing - it's hot.  It is just a way better movie of this type and hasn't got the attention it deserves.

On there, DJ, a character played by Columbus Short went to an all Black historical college Truth University. DJ was from L.A. and when he moved to Atlanta with his uncle and aunt, that suddenly changed. One thing is when you're ready to go to Truth, there's brotherhood is always there for you. First, Mu Gamma Xi, a crew led by Grant ( Darrin Henson ) who won seven times easily and the president of Mu Gamma is Zeke ( Laz Alonzo ). As soon as the beef comes between DJ and Grant after DJ schoolling him, Theta Nu Theta's leader Sylvester ( played by Brian White ) came to DJ's rescue. When DJ turned down on Mu Gamma Xi, he went to the Theta crew along with Rich (Ne-Yo) and Noel (Jermaine Williams) joning with DJ. Meagan Good, who plays April (DJ's love interest) finally saved the movie when Theta Nu & Mu Gamma faces head to head for the competition. What I do love about the movie is the hardcore move: Krumping! April's father Dr William Palmer wasn't interested with DJ because he's a troublemaker thanks to DJ's rivalries Grant and Zeke. But that didn't stop it, April and DJ's aunt Jackie (played by the sweetest Valarie Pettiford) came to DJ's rescue for the second time. Final scene is the greatest scene in my opinion when Theta Nu Theta win that competition for the better.

651855,A1Q1PP3Z4QDUQM,B00005JPK8,Farffleblex Plaffington,"[3, 10]","Is there really a world where gang members and hip college students' lives are centered around often-absurd group-choreographed ""dance-off"" parties?  Sure, it's good exercise for kids (and the athleticism and choreography in the film are impressive), but it's difficult for me to believe that this is really going on.  Maybe we're going to see a craze for this now as we had similar crazes in the wake of Saturday Night Fever (1977) and Urban Cowboy (1980)?Of course, it doesn't have to be about reality for me to think it's a good film, but the problem here is that the dance-off, or ""stomp"", sections are incredibly bizarre, yet they're played completely straight.  You'd only have to notch it up slightly to make a hilarious absurdist comedy out of this.  The funniest parts are when the dancers effectively ""trade insults"" through choreography.  It's not that I can't appreciate ""dance-off"" films.  I love Saturday Night Fever, for example.  And even the recent Roll Bounce (2005) was a great film.But here the ""dance-off"" bits eat up the majority of screen time, and not only do the participants approach them in a deadly serious way, as if they care far more about them than anything imaginable--members of the opposite sex, other sports, other music . . . or how about concentrating on schoolwork?--but even people who aren't participating tend to react to the ""stompers"" like late 1950s teens in the presence of Elvis.  And with Elvis, they at least had the excuse that they didn't go to school with him every day.  There's also a hard-to-swallow militarism in the ""stomping"".  Cadet Kelly (2002) featured something like this, but it made sense in that context.  Maybe this should have been set at a military school?A bigger problem (since the ""stomping"" as intentionally absurdist is something I'd probably rate relatively high) is that there's a decent, serious drama buried here.  We get to explore it for about 15 - 20 minutes, but that's not enough.  This could be quite a tear-jerker from many different angles, but instead, you find yourself continually asking ""What planet is this on?"" as director Sylvain White makes sure that we get more ""stomping"" every few minutes.",2,"There's a good story buried in there . . . or a surreal, hilarious romp",1194048000,"11 3, 2007",2007,2185,"['really', 'world', 'where', 'gang', 'members', 'hip', 'college', 'students', 'lives', 'are', 'centered', 'often-absurd', 'group-choreographed', 'dance-off', 'parties', 'Sure', 'good', 'exercise', 'kids', 'athleticism', 'choreography', 'film', 'are', 'impressive', 'difficult', 'believe', 'really', 'going', 'Maybe', ""'re"", 'going', 'see', 'craze', 'now', 'had', 'similar', 'crazes', 'wake', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Fever', '1977', 'Urban', 'Cowboy', '1980', 'course', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'reality', 'think', 'good', 'film', 'problem', 'here', 'dance-off', 'stomp', 'sections', 'are', 'incredibly', 'bizarre', 'yet', ""'re"", 'played', 'completely', 'straight', ""'d"", 'only', 'have', 'notch', 'up', 'slightly', 'make', 'hilarious', 'absurdist', 'comedy', 'funniest', 'parts', 'are', 'when', 'dancers', 'effectively', 'trade', 'insults', 'choreography', 'not', 'ca', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'dance-off', 'films', 'love', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Fever', 'example', 'even', 'recent', 'Roll', 'Bounce', '2005', 'was', 'great', 'film.But', 'here', 'dance-off', 'bits', 'eat', 'up', 'majority', 'screen', 'time', 'not', 'only', 'do', 'participants', 'approach', 'deadly', 'serious', 'way', 'care', 'far', 'more', 'anything', 'imaginable', 'members', 'opposite', 'sex', 'other', 'sports', 'other', 'music', 'how', 'concentrating', 'schoolwork', 'even', 'people', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'participating', 'tend', 'react', 'stompers', 'late', '1950s', 'teens', 'presence', 'Elvis', 'Elvis', 'least', 'had', 'excuse', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'school', 'day', 'also', 'hard-to-swallow', 'militarism', 'stomping', 'Cadet', 'Kelly', '2002', 'featured', 'something', 'made', 'sense', 'context', 'Maybe', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'set', 'military', 'school', 'A', 'bigger', 'problem', 'stomping', 'intentionally', 'absurdist', 'something', ""'d"", 'probably', 'rate', 'relatively', 'high', 'decent', 'serious', 'drama', 'buried', 'here', 'get', 'explore', '15', '20', 'minutes', 'not', 'enough', 'could', 'be', 'quite', 'tear-jerker', 'many', 'different', 'angles', 'instead', 'find', 'continually', 'asking', 'What', 'planet', 'director', 'Sylvain', 'White', 'sure', 'get', 'more', 'stomping', 'few', 'minutes']",Stomp the Yard

DJ (the enormously talented dancer/actor Columbus Short) is sent from Los Angeles to Atlanta's Truth University after his conviction for street brawling, a fight in which his brother (Chris Brown) was killed. Once on campus DJ is works for his uncle as a gardener and is soon courted for his step dance skills by two rival fraternities. One fraternity gains DJ's attention and he pledges. Of course there is the requisite love conflict (the beautiful Meagan Good as April), who just happens to be the girlfriend of the rival fraternity step leader (Darrin Henson), and the usual undercurrent of familial dichotomies between DJ's humble background and April's influential father bring the tension to the front: the result is DJ's triumphant performance in the annual stepping competition between the two fraternities.  The ending is predictable but sensitive and with a message.The real star of the film is the magnificently choreographed and executed dancing, performed by the actual cast members.  Director Sylvain White and his choreographers center their attention on the big sequences and the result is very fine entertainment.  In addition to the gifted Columbus Short and Darrin Henson the cast includes such fine actor/dancers as Brian J. White, Ne-Yo, Laz Alonzo, Oliver Ryan Best, Richmond Duain Martyn, Justin Hires, and many others.  It is difficult to resist the excitement of the commitment of this fine cast to the introduction of step dancing to the public at large. So much talent!

I also like that this film tries to shed light on one subculture's social life at historically Black colleges. As is with so many typical Hollywood productions, lots of focus is on the protagonist's love interest, and there's lots of 'bad boy' male ego and aggression, blah blah blah... The plot is predictable and formulaic - not much in the way of suspense, tension, or surprise. The level of this film is about that of most middle school students, though some parents might object to those elements that helped it get an 'R' rating. I do wish that this film tried more to draw the viewer in to college life (and higher education in general) for Southern Blacks; that was the piece that interested me the most.

I figured that if there was anything else good about it then that would only be a bonus.Well, I found little else to get excited about.First of all, the music was not disappointing.  When I cranked up my home theater I not only heard the music but felt it.  I really enjoyed the beat, rhythm, and tempo.  But I think I would have been better off if I had just fast forwarded through the rest of the movie.There is a love story, but it is unrealistic and, at best, silly.  There was the whole emotional thing about the main character's brother, but the main character really didn't seem to have much trouble putting that stuff behind him except for one scene that was completely comical (""Do it for your brother!?!?!?"") and obviously written where the director was expecting an Oscar or something.  There was the Fraternity thing about brotherhood and togetherness, but it was touched on so lightly that it just became background noise.  Good grades and education?  Hardly mentioned.  Hard work?  Same.  And if there are any rules to ""stepping"" or ""stomping"" or ""battling"" or whatever they want to call it, I had trouble following it.  The only rule that made sense was that the winner was the one/group who made the audience most excited.  But I was struck how little, stupid, mindless silly things would get them excited.  So..... *shrug*It got so bad that my wife couldn't take it anymore after about 2/3rds of the movie and pretty much fell into a Mystery Science Theater 3000 movie mockery which is entirely not like her.  But I couldn't blame her, it was the only way to make the movie interesting.So, if you love a killer soundtrack with a great beat then pick it up for that.

The big standout in the film is of course Columbus Short as a lead actor. Though he has many dancing and television credits on his resume, this film marks his first turn in a lead film role--and it is the perfect opportunity. Short is an above-average talent who possesses the kind of charm and screen presence that could make him a leading man for his generation. He plays the part of D.J., a teen-age dancer who battles competitively in Los Angeles until tragedy strikes. Eventually, he is sent by his mother to live in Atlanta with his uncle and aunt, who have helped him enroll in the historically Black Truth University. While D.J. takes classes and works at Truth, he is drawn to the culture of stepping at Black fraternities. He soon finds a way to mesh his talents with his new environment, while also pursuing a new love interest, April (Meagan Goode). Against the odds, D.J.--young, talented and arrogant-- is drawn into the competition of his life.After watching this you will come to fine out that some musicians such as Ne-Yo and Chris Brown can be actors too. They both provided some comical relief and some pretty good acting I thought that ""Stomp the Yard"" was a good movie. Very entertaining, and the dancing was remarkable, but it had a deep inner message to go with it... for young and old alike! There is so much talent in our young African Americans but at times directed in the wrong direction. What was also likable and quite inspiring, is a scene in which the main character visits an honorary hall, filled with various pictures of national African-American figures affiliated with many well-known fraternities. Some of the people shown? Esther Rolle, Rosa Parks, Coretta Scott King, and Martin Luther King, to name a few. This scene really gave me a sense of pride when I saw it, and a respect for the leaders of the past.Though the electric dance routines give this movie its vibrant energy. It may not be representative of what happens on Black campuses or inside Black fraternities but it offers nuance about the campus stepping culture--new school versus old school, traditional versus styles influenced by hip hop and break dancing. I appreciate ""Stomp the Yard"" for trying to show a well-known culture in a respected community, but it might not go as deep as you might expect it to be other than that it's a good movie.",4,Some people seriously need to stop sipping on hatred.,1179964800,"05 24, 2007",2007,2412,"['story', 'might', 'be', 'predictable', 'stomping', 'amazing', 'big', 'standout', 'film', 'course', 'Columbus', 'Short', 'lead', 'actor', 'many', 'dancing', 'television', 'credits', 'resume', 'film', 'first', 'turn', 'lead', 'film', 'role', 'perfect', 'opportunity', 'Short', 'above-average', 'talent', 'who', 'kind', 'charm', 'screen', 'presence', 'could', 'make', 'leading', 'man', 'generation', 'part', 'D.J.', 'teen-age', 'dancer', 'who', 'competitively', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'tragedy', 'strikes', 'Eventually', 'sent', 'mother', 'live', 'Atlanta', 'uncle', 'aunt', 'who', 'have', 'helped', 'enroll', 'historically', 'Black', 'Truth', 'University', 'D.J', 'classes', 'Truth', 'drawn', 'culture', 'stepping', 'Black', 'fraternities', 'soon', 'way', 'mesh', 'talents', 'new', 'environment', 'also', 'pursuing', 'new', 'love', 'interest', 'April', 'Meagan', 'Goode', 'odds', 'D.J.', 'young', 'talented', 'arrogant', 'drawn', 'competition', 'life.After', 'watching', 'will', 'come', 'fine', 'out', 'musicians', 'such', 'Ne-Yo', 'Chris', 'Brown', 'can', 'be', 'actors', 'too', 'provided', 'comical', 'relief', 'pretty', 'good', 'acting', 'thought', 'Stomp', 'Yard', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'Very', 'entertaining', 'dancing', 'was', 'remarkable', 'had', 'deep', 'inner', 'message', 'go', 'young', 'old', 'alike', 'so', 'much', 'talent', 'young', 'African', 'Americans', 'times', 'directed', 'wrong', 'direction', 'What', 'was', 'also', 'likable', 'quite', 'inspiring', 'scene', 'main', 'character', 'visits', 'honorary', 'hall', 'filled', 'various', 'pictures', 'national', 'African-American', 'figures', 'affiliated', 'many', 'well-known', 'fraternities', 'people', 'shown', 'Esther', 'Rolle', 'Rosa', 'Parks', 'Coretta', 'Scott', 'King', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'name', 'few', 'scene', 'really', 'gave', 'sense', 'pride', 'when', 'saw', 'respect', 'leaders', 'past.Though', 'electric', 'dance', 'routines', 'give', 'movie', 'vibrant', 'energy', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'representative', 'what', 'Black', 'campuses', 'inside', 'Black', 'fraternities', 'nuance', 'campus', 'stepping', 'culture', 'new', 'school', 'versus', 'old', 'school', 'traditional', 'versus', 'styles', 'influenced', 'hip', 'hop', 'break', 'dancing', 'appreciate', 'Stomp', 'Yard', 'trying', 'show', 'well-known', 'culture', 'respected', 'community', 'might', 'not', 'go', 'as', 'deep', 'might', 'expect', 'be', 'other', 'good', 'movie']",Stomp the Yard

I'm Kind Of A ...","[11, 14]","It's a terrible experience when someone close to you passes and it's even rougher when it's your baby brother. After dancing in a battle and winning a hat full of money Dj ""Columbus Short"", his brother ""Chris Brown"" and his team beat the wrong team this time. While walking home in a dark alley the other team jumped them to get their money back but bad turns to worst and DJ's brother is shot and killed. DJ is sent to live with his Uncle and aunt in Atlanta and is expected to go to college. When he arrives on campus he sees some things he's never seen before like fraternities and stepping and it's all downhill from there. During this film DJ learns things that boys need to learn to become men especially love and even gets to do what he loves most while he's there. He ends up becoming a major key to one frat in dieing need of something fresh.The first time I saw the preview for ""Stomp the Yard"" I automatically thought, ""Wow, the stepping version of Drumline"" but at the same time I felt it would be pretty good. Though this movie does resemble Drumline the story differs a bit. The first being ""Darrin Henson"" (Soul Food the series) who is a good actor but a dancer and choreographer first and I would say a better choreographer than actor since he probably makes more money off of it. Of course the others being ""Chris Brown"" and ""Columbus Short"", most of the cast are dancers acting unlike ""Drumline"" where Nick Cannon was an actor who had to learn how to play the drums. Even the two frats remind you of ""Drumline"" one frat has an old school style and hasn't won in 7 years and the other has a grimey aggressive new shchool that never loses.Darrin played his character well and though Chris Brown wasn't in there that long he did ok but Columbus Short danced better than he acted and it took a little from the movie. He didn't show the same feeling and emotion in his acting as he did in his dancing. You can see this in the film when he loosens up when he dances and then starts to get really tight when he goes back to acting. There was only one big problem I had with ""Stomp the Yard"", the first being how the story is told. In the middle of the movie when DJ is pledging to get into a fraternity his pledging is basically skipped and he's in.The stepping and overall choreography is amazing and gets better towards the end of the film. The acting was cool as well as the story but still the dancing outshines them. The history told in this movie makes me proud and gives the movie that extra something. It would've been really cool though if they shined a little more light on where stepping came from and why it's so important in black colleges today. Overall this is a very good movie that was made very well but I have to say that I think women will enjoy this more than guys, when you see it you'll know what I mean.",4,This Movie Reminds Me Of Something,1179705600,"05 21, 2007",2007,2838,"['terrible', 'experience', 'when', 'someone', 'close', 'passes', 'even', 'rougher', 'when', 'baby', 'brother', 'dancing', 'battle', 'winning', 'hat', 'full', 'money', 'Dj', 'Columbus', 'Short', 'brother', 'Chris', 'Brown', 'team', 'beat', 'wrong', 'team', 'time', 'walking', 'home', 'dark', 'alley', 'other', 'team', 'jumped', 'get', 'money', 'back', 'bad', 'turns', 'worst', 'DJ', 'brother', 'shot', 'killed', 'DJ', 'sent', 'live', 'Uncle', 'aunt', 'Atlanta', 'expected', 'go', 'college', 'When', 'campus', 'things', 'never', 'seen', 'like', 'fraternities', 'stepping', 'downhill', 'there', 'film', 'DJ', 'things', 'boys', 'need', 'learn', 'become', 'men', 'especially', 'love', 'even', 'do', 'what', 'most', 'there', 'up', 'becoming', 'major', 'key', 'one', 'frat', 'dieing', 'need', 'something', 'fresh.The', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'preview', 'Stomp', 'Yard', 'automatically', 'thought', 'Wow', 'stepping', 'version', 'Drumline', 'same', 'time', 'felt', 'would', 'be', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'resemble', 'Drumline', 'story', 'bit', 'first', 'being', 'Darrin', 'Henson', 'Soul', 'Food', 'series', 'who', 'good', 'actor', 'dancer', 'choreographer', 'first', 'would', 'say', 'better', 'choreographer', 'actor', 'probably', 'more', 'money', 'course', 'others', 'being', 'Chris', 'Brown', 'Columbus', 'Short', 'most', 'cast', 'are', 'dancers', 'acting', 'Drumline', 'where', 'Nick', 'Cannon', 'was', 'actor', 'who', 'had', 'learn', 'how', 'play', 'drums', 'Even', 'two', 'frats', 'remind', 'Drumline', 'one', 'frat', 'old', 'school', 'style', ""n't"", 'won', '7', 'years', 'other', 'grimey', 'aggressive', 'new', 'shchool', 'never', 'played', 'character', 'well', 'Chris', 'Brown', 'was', ""n't"", 'long', 'did', 'ok', 'Columbus', 'Short', 'danced', 'better', 'acted', 'took', 'little', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'same', 'feeling', 'emotion', 'acting', 'did', 'dancing', 'can', 'see', 'film', 'when', 'up', 'when', 'then', 'get', 'really', 'tight', 'when', 'back', 'acting', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'big', 'problem', 'had', 'Stomp', 'Yard', 'first', 'being', 'how', 'story', 'told', 'middle', 'movie', 'when', 'DJ', 'pledging', 'get', 'fraternity', 'pledging', 'basically', 'skipped', 'in.The', 'stepping', 'overall', 'choreography', 'amazing', 'better', 'end', 'film', 'acting', 'was', 'cool', 'as', 'well', 'story', 'still', 'dancing', 'history', 'told', 'movie', 'proud', 'movie', 'extra', 'something', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'really', 'cool', 'shined', 'little', 'more', 'light', 'where', 'stepping', 'came', 'why', 'so', 'important', 'black', 'colleges', 'today', 'Overall', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'very', 'well', 'have', 'say', 'think', 'women', 'will', 'enjoy', 'more', 'guys', 'when', 'see', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', 'mean']",Stomp the Yard

Hinton ""avid reader""","[2, 6]","After his younger brother Duron is killed following a misunderstand with a rival dance team, Los Angeles native DJ moves to Atlanta to live with his aunt and uncle. His aunt works as a real estate agent and his uncle works as a groundskeeper at hisotrically-black college Truth University, where DJ enrolls in school. College has never been DJ's goal, but he goes because Duron wanted to graduate from college and because he feels responsble for Duron's death.Almost immediately after arriving on the campus of fictional Truth University, DJ realizes the south is nothing like LA. When he sees a beautiful girl (Meagan Good) that he simply has to talk to, he makes the mistake of breaking the invisible line created by one of the fraternity step teams and is immediately put in his place by Sylvester, head of Theta Nu Theta. DJ quickly learns that Theta Nu has been in a vicious battle with rival fraternity Mu Gamma for the last seven years to see who will be crowned the national step champion. Theta Nu has lost the last seven years in a row--and DJ has lost the girl he wanted to talk to.It just so happens that the girl, April, happens to be dating Grant, second-in-command with Mu Gamma. When DJ sees the way that Grant treats April, walking all over her and making her feel like she's lucky to be with him, he decides to put him in his place. Breaking out all of his moves from his LA dance battling days, DJ pretty much serves Grant in front of all of the Truth students at a dance club one night. Though he's embarrassed that he got served, Grant has grudging respect for DJ and tries to recruit him to join Mu Gamma. Then DJ spews my favorite line of the whole film, ""I don't step. I battle."" And you just know it's going to be on from that point.Long story short, DJ's roommate convinces him that joining a black fraternity is about more than just stepping. It's about honor, history, and being a part of something bigger than yourself. He convinces DJ to join Theta Nu with him, with the hope that DJ's fresh moves will bring the Theta Nu step team out of the dark ages.Stomp the Yard is a must-see for anyone who enjoys teen dance movies like Honey and You Got Served. Yes, the plot does bear some resemblance to YGS, with the addition of a college campus and a sense of purpose to take the place of drug deals and gang violence. Columbus Short (who plays DJ and is a former backup dancer for Britney Spears) dances his [...] for most of the film, and I've got to say the dance sequences were way better in this film than in YGS. In fact, there were a lot of familiar faces if you're into hip hop and R&B; with DJ's roommate played by young star Ne-Yo and his younger brother by Chris Brown of ""Run It"" fame. Additionally, it was nice to see a movie targeted at young people where the romance was used as a nice backdrop to the real plot of the movie instead of its sole focus.If you're interested in an ""urban"" movie with great dance sequences and people getting served that isn't just about life on the streets, Stomp The Yard should be right up your alley.",4,"""I don't step, I battle""",1169769600,"01 26, 2007",2007,3073,"['younger', 'brother', 'Duron', 'killed', 'following', 'misunderstand', 'rival', 'dance', 'team', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'native', 'DJ', 'Atlanta', 'live', 'aunt', 'uncle', 'aunt', 'real', 'estate', 'agent', 'uncle', 'groundskeeper', 'hisotrically-black', 'college', 'Truth', 'University', 'where', 'DJ', 'school', 'College', 'never', 'been', 'DJ', 'goal', 'Duron', 'wanted', 'graduate', 'college', 'responsble', 'Duron', 'death.Almost', 'immediately', 'arriving', 'campus', 'fictional', 'Truth', 'University', 'DJ', 'south', 'nothing', 'LA', 'When', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'Meagan', 'Good', 'simply', 'talk', 'mistake', 'breaking', 'invisible', 'line', 'created', 'one', 'fraternity', 'step', 'teams', 'immediately', 'put', 'place', 'Sylvester', 'head', 'Theta', 'Nu', 'Theta', 'DJ', 'quickly', 'Theta', 'Nu', 'been', 'vicious', 'battle', 'rival', 'fraternity', 'Mu', 'Gamma', 'last', 'seven', 'years', 'see', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'crowned', 'national', 'step', 'champion', 'Theta', 'Nu', 'lost', 'last', 'seven', 'years', 'row', 'DJ', 'lost', 'girl', 'wanted', 'talk', 'to.It', 'just', 'so', 'girl', 'April', 'be', 'dating', 'Grant', 'second-in-command', 'Mu', 'Gamma', 'When', 'DJ', 'way', 'Grant', 'April', 'walking', 'making', 'feel', 'lucky', 'be', 'put', 'place', 'Breaking', 'moves', 'LA', 'dance', 'battling', 'days', 'DJ', 'pretty', 'much', 'serves', 'Grant', 'front', 'Truth', 'students', 'dance', 'club', 'one', 'night', 'embarrassed', 'got', 'served', 'Grant', 'grudging', 'respect', 'DJ', 'tries', 'recruit', 'join', 'Mu', 'Gamma', 'Then', 'DJ', 'spews', 'favorite', 'line', 'whole', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'step', 'battle', 'just', 'know', 'going', 'be', 'point.Long', 'story', 'short', 'DJ', 'roommate', 'convinces', 'joining', 'black', 'fraternity', 'more', 'just', 'stepping', 'honor', 'history', 'being', 'part', 'something', 'bigger', 'DJ', 'join', 'Theta', 'Nu', 'hope', 'DJ', 'fresh', 'moves', 'will', 'bring', 'Theta', 'Nu', 'step', 'team', 'dark', 'Yard', 'must-see', 'anyone', 'who', 'teen', 'dance', 'movies', 'Honey', 'Got', 'Served', 'Yes', 'plot', 'bear', 'resemblance', 'YGS', 'addition', 'college', 'campus', 'sense', 'purpose', 'take', 'place', 'drug', 'deals', 'gang', 'violence', 'Columbus', 'Short', 'who', 'DJ', 'former', 'backup', 'dancer', 'Britney', 'Spears', '[', ']', 'most', 'film', ""'ve"", 'got', 'say', 'dance', 'sequences', 'were', 'way', 'better', 'film', 'YGS', 'fact', 'were', 'lot', 'familiar', ""'re"", 'hip', 'hop', 'R', 'B', 'DJ', 'roommate', 'played', 'young', 'star', 'Ne-Yo', 'younger', 'brother', 'Chris', 'Brown', 'Run', 'fame', 'Additionally', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'movie', 'targeted', 'young', 'people', 'where', 'romance', 'was', 'used', 'nice', 'backdrop', 'real', 'plot', 'movie', 'instead', 'sole', 'focus.If', ""'re"", 'interested', 'urban', 'movie', 'great', 'dance', 'sequences', 'people', 'getting', 'served', ""n't"", 'just', 'about', 'life', 'streets', 'Stomp', 'Yard', 'should', 'be', 'right', 'alley']",Stomp the Yard

I didn't know anything about the movie except that there would be stepping in it and a fraternity story tied into it. So of course I expected to see a movie that was right along the lines of school daze. Totally wrong!!!!! Stomp the yard should have been named You got served 2 or drumline 2 because it was more focused on dancing than on Frat life and stepping. The average  age in the movie theater was around 14 years of age so this movie really wasn't geared toward a 30 year black greek. When stepping was shown, (which wasn't a lot of the movie) the scenes were decent. I was more impressed with the B-Boy dance scenes when the actors were break dancing. I made sure to ask some friends of mine that are in other frats (alphas, ques) what they thought of  the movie and they all felt the same as me. The movie did not show the positive aspects of the frat (community service, mentoring) and only made it look like frats are about partying and dancing.

That includes the plot, which revolves around a young L.A. street dancer named D.J. (Columbus Short) who enrolls in Atlanta's Truth University and immediately finds himself caught up in the rivalry between two fraternities specializing in what is called competitive ""stomp"" dancing.  The film also chronicles the lovelorn lad's near-stalker-like efforts to woo April (Meagan Good), the provost's beautiful daughter, despite the fact that she is already going out with a self-centered, super creep of a boyfriend (Darrin Dewitt Henson), who also happens to be one of the leaders of a rival fraternity.Although the plot complications are relatively straightforward and easy to follow, you just might want to keep a ""street slang-to-English"" dictionary handy to help you through some of the dialogue.  Unfortunately, the predictability of the storyline and the triteness of the romantic entanglements pretty much vitiate the attractive novelty of the context and setting.That pretty much leaves just the dancing, which isn't all that terrific, actually, thanks to the frenetic, hurdy-gurdy quality of the editing, which breaks up the movements and prevents the dancers from establishing a smooth-flowing rhythm and style.  We see their dance routines only in fragmented bits and pieces, a technique that does little justice to the vision and hard work of the performers, who clearly possess an impressive store of untapped energy and talent.  At least that's more than can be said for the acting, which ranges in quality from the merely passable to the distressingly amateurish.There are moments of inspirational racial pride sprinkled in among the melodrama and dance sequences, but they are quickly swept away by the contrivances and cliches that ultimately inundate the film.Stomp on over to the refund counter.",2,unimpressive dance film,1182297600,"06 20, 2007",2007,1901,"['Stomp', 'Yard', 'film', 'solely', 'dancing', 'else', 'mere', 'filler', 'plot', 'young', 'L.A.', 'street', 'dancer', 'named', 'D.J', 'Columbus', 'Short', 'who', 'Atlanta', 'Truth', 'University', 'immediately', 'caught', 'up', 'rivalry', 'two', 'fraternities', 'specializing', 'what', 'called', 'competitive', 'stomp', 'dancing', 'film', 'also', 'lovelorn', 'lad', 'near-stalker-like', 'efforts', 'woo', 'April', 'Meagan', 'Good', 'provost', 'beautiful', 'daughter', 'fact', 'already', 'going', 'out', 'self-centered', 'super', 'creep', 'boyfriend', 'Darrin', 'Dewitt', 'Henson', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'one', 'leaders', 'rival', 'plot', 'complications', 'are', 'relatively', 'straightforward', 'easy', 'follow', 'just', 'might', 'want', 'keep', 'street', 'slang-to-English', 'dictionary', 'handy', 'help', 'dialogue', 'Unfortunately', 'predictability', 'storyline', 'triteness', 'romantic', 'entanglements', 'pretty', 'much', 'attractive', 'novelty', 'context', 'setting.That', 'pretty', 'much', 'just', 'dancing', ""n't"", 'terrific', 'actually', 'thanks', 'frenetic', 'hurdy-gurdy', 'quality', 'editing', 'up', 'movements', 'dancers', 'establishing', 'smooth-flowing', 'rhythm', 'style', 'see', 'dance', 'routines', 'only', 'fragmented', 'bits', 'pieces', 'technique', 'little', 'justice', 'vision', 'hard', 'work', 'performers', 'who', 'clearly', 'possess', 'impressive', 'store', 'untapped', 'energy', 'talent', 'least', 'more', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'acting', 'quality', 'merely', 'passable', 'distressingly', 'are', 'moments', 'inspirational', 'racial', 'pride', 'sprinkled', 'melodrama', 'dance', 'sequences', 'are', 'quickly', 'swept', 'away', 'contrivances', 'cliches', 'ultimately', 'inundate', 'film.Stomp', 'refund', 'counter']",Stomp the Yard

It's hard to decipher cool, but Short is, and ""Stomp The Yard"" burns his wick to its advantage.Short is DJ, a hip-hop ""battle"" dancer from Los Angeles who specializes, from the look of it, in ""crunking,"" a hyper kinetic series of violent-yet-rhythmic convulsions that culminates in a leap, flip or some other form of levitation. The movie opens with a battle-gone-bad, as DJ watches a dance rival murder his brother Davon (Chris Brown, in a cameo).DJ is sent to Atlanta to attend Truth University - a historical black college - under the eye of his uncle (Harry Lennix), a campus landscaper. At Truth, the scene revolves around two fraternities that field teams in stepping. If you've seen ""Stomp!"", you seen stepping. It's a choreographed dance-and-chant performance that grows more elaborate as the movie progresses.Both frats want DJ. DJ wants a cute girl named April (Meagan Good). April dates the captain of one of the teams, who doesn't like DJ, who finally decides to pledge with the underdog, while learning to be part of a team, as the girl begins to fall for him...OK, look. The story's a shaggy dog. But it doesn't apologize for it, and the performances lack the self-consciousness found in ""Dreamgirls.""  The dance scenes, directed by Sylvain White, are terrific. Especially the opening battle, which combines ""You've Got Served"" with the grit of the stage in ""8 Mile.""Short is such a veteran of ""Stomp!"" and dance he could perform half these routines sedated. But he also gives DJ a quiet, impressive certitude. Short has more than the charm of the misunderstood thug - he's sly and understated. DJ's courtship of April isn't frantic, nor exploitative. Good  flounces around with her breasts all bunched up and exposed, but she's a good-natured movie vixen otherwise.White delays the climactic stepping competition with plot nonsense for a half-hour before DJ and his team finally deliver the dance moves. The musical production seems right out of a Bollywood musical (or a Wes Anderson film) but, somehow, this seems in line with the movie's spirit. Happy. Passionate. Sweaty.In a performance film, give me exuberance over calculation. And ""Stomp The Yard"" over the acclaimed ""Dreamgirls.""

651882,A2C5VLIJMDPWHI,B00005JPK8,"Shamontiel L. Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[4, 7]","Pros: I am crazy about college movies, television shows, books, etc. When I was going to a small, secluded college for two years, I realized quickly that that place was not for me and transferred to an HBCU to explore the culture of Greeks, learn more about African American literature and history, and getting that college experience I'd been waiting for since elementary school. I was not disappointed there and I definitely was not disappointed with this movie. Greek stepping has been around for almost a century, and before that, many African tribal dances were the root of it. I've read reviews from various sites that keep comparing this movie to ""You Got Served,"" ""Step Up,"" and ""Drumline,"" but there is no comparison. Stepping has been around for almost 50 years more than hip hop and breakin, and battling is something that has been done for centuries with African tribes. Stepping was originally created from the old Wally dance where Africans would wear bells on their shoes to create music. There was no dominant male father figure in ""Drumline"" or ""You Got Served"" the way ""Stomp the Yard"" had. There was no serious legal trouble in YGS or DL. There was no off-beat white boy trying to reclaim his instrument in STY. And for those of you who say the history was not explored in STY, why weren't you all making those same complaints about drums and other instruments of Africa when watching DL? If the movie is going to be compared to something, ""School Daze"" is a better comparison considering both movies explore administrative hold-ups and battles between those of the street and those in school (remember the KFC scene?) I appreciate how STY took it a step further and showed how the legal system and universities interact with each other, and how our OWN can hold us back as well.One of my cousins is an AKA and she said that she felt the movie didn't give credit to Greeks for performing community service, but there was a whole scene in the movie that showed positive black leaders who had not only been Greek members, but OBVIOUSLY went on to perform bigger tasks (ex. Martin Luther King as an Alpha and Rosa Parks as an AKA). And several instances in the movie, people kept telling DJ that a frat is ""more than stepping."" From a nonGreek perspective, I felt the movie was true to form, but it did highlight the entertainment aspect moreso than the charitable aspect of Greek life.When I watch Greeks step, I can feel the energy, the urgency, the enthusiasm, and sweat of it all. The real Greeks and actors alike sucked me right into every single stepoff (ugly faces and all). On top of that, this movie brought on a new dimension by discussing how society views ex-convicts; the connection that a man can have to a younger man; chivalry; education; love; and brotherhood. There was so much of this movie that made me beam and recall moments I've had just like it to the point where I felt like I was there. And if that didn't do it, there was SO much eye candy (like Columbus Short, Brian White, Laz Alonso) in this movie that it was ridiculous. Chris Brown did the damn thing with his dancing, and I was not surprised. But I was surprised by how excellently the guy from ""Soul Food"" did. I'd never seen him dance, although I'd heard about it. I was also very surprised to see that JET magazine was right when they stated how audience members would be impressed with Columbus Short's performance. The magazine talked about how challenging his role would be to play one of the lead characters and the best stepper, but he pulled it off quite nicely. I cracked up when he hit up all of the coasts to make fun of their dances, and that man is an excellent dancer. I have seen the movie twice so far and I plan on seeing it at least three more times before it leaves the show. I'm telling everybody I know to go see it and so far, the feedback I've heard from friends and family has been ""explosive.""When ""A Different World"" came out, that show helped to increase money for HBCUs because people really wanted to learn about that environment and have the HBCU experience. I went to see the movie with someone who I've never heard say a word about being interested in college, and she yelled at me for never inviting her up to mine. That's impressive! When a movie is so captivating that it can make people want to go to an institution to experience it too, that's when you know that the movie's mission has succeeded.Cons: Absolutely nothing.",5,My new favorite movie,1174780800,"03 25, 2007",2007,4459,"['Pros', 'am', 'crazy', 'college', 'movies', 'television', 'shows', 'books', 'etc', 'When', 'was', 'going', 'small', 'secluded', 'college', 'two', 'years', 'realized', 'quickly', 'place', 'was', 'not', 'transferred', 'HBCU', 'explore', 'culture', 'Greeks', 'learn', 'more', 'African', 'American', 'literature', 'history', 'getting', 'college', 'experience', ""'d"", 'been', 'waiting', 'elementary', 'school', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'there', 'definitely', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'Greek', 'stepping', 'been', 'almost', 'century', 'many', 'African', 'tribal', 'dances', 'were', 'root', ""'ve"", 'read', 'reviews', 'various', 'sites', 'keep', 'comparing', 'movie', 'Got', 'Served', 'Step', 'Up', 'Drumline', 'comparison', 'Stepping', 'been', 'almost', '50', 'years', 'more', 'hip', 'hop', 'breakin', 'battling', 'something', 'been', 'done', 'centuries', 'African', 'tribes', 'Stepping', 'was', 'originally', 'created', 'old', 'Wally', 'dance', 'where', 'Africans', 'would', 'wear', 'bells', 'shoes', 'create', 'music', 'was', 'dominant', 'male', 'father', 'figure', 'Drumline', 'Got', 'Served', 'way', 'Stomp', 'Yard', 'had', 'was', 'serious', 'legal', 'trouble', 'YGS', 'DL', 'was', 'off-beat', 'white', 'boy', 'trying', 'reclaim', 'instrument', 'STY', 'who', 'say', 'history', 'was', 'not', 'explored', 'STY', 'why', 'were', ""n't"", 'making', 'same', 'complaints', 'drums', 'other', 'instruments', 'Africa', 'when', 'watching', 'DL', 'movie', 'going', 'be', 'compared', 'something', 'School', 'Daze', 'better', 'comparison', 'considering', 'movies', 'explore', 'administrative', 'hold-ups', 'battles', 'street', 'school', 'remember', 'KFC', 'scene', 'appreciate', 'how', 'STY', 'took', 'step', 'further', 'showed', 'how', 'legal', 'system', 'universities', 'interact', 'other', 'how', 'OWN', 'can', 'hold', 'back', 'well.One', 'cousins', 'AKA', 'said', 'felt', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'credit', 'Greeks', 'performing', 'community', 'service', 'there', 'was', 'whole', 'scene', 'movie', 'showed', 'positive', 'black', 'leaders', 'who', 'had', 'not', 'only', 'been', 'Greek', 'members', 'OBVIOUSLY', 'went', 'perform', 'bigger', 'tasks', 'ex', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'Alpha', 'Rosa', 'Parks', 'AKA', 'several', 'instances', 'movie', 'people', 'kept', 'telling', 'DJ', 'frat', 'more', 'stepping', 'nonGreek', 'perspective', 'felt', 'movie', 'was', 'true', 'form', 'did', 'highlight', 'entertainment', 'aspect', 'moreso', 'charitable', 'aspect', 'Greek', 'life.When', 'watch', 'Greeks', 'step', 'can', 'feel', 'energy', 'urgency', 'enthusiasm', 'sweat', 'real', 'Greeks', 'actors', 'alike', 'sucked', 'right', 'single', 'stepoff', 'ugly', 'top', 'movie', 'brought', 'new', 'dimension', 'discussing', 'how', 'society', 'views', 'ex-convicts', 'connection', 'man', 'can', 'have', 'younger', 'man', 'chivalry', 'education', 'brotherhood', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'movie', 'made', 'beam', 'recall', 'moments', ""'ve"", 'had', 'just', 'point', 'where', 'felt', 'was', 'there', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'was', 'SO', 'much', 'eye', 'candy', 'Columbus', 'Short', 'Brian', 'White', 'Laz', 'Alonso', 'movie', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'Chris', 'Brown', 'did', 'damn', 'thing', 'dancing', 'was', 'not', 'surprised', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'excellently', 'guy', 'Soul', 'Food', 'did', ""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'dance', ""'d"", 'heard', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'surprised', 'see', 'JET', 'magazine', 'was', 'right', 'when', 'stated', 'how', 'audience', 'members', 'would', 'be', 'impressed', 'Columbus', 'Short', 'performance', 'magazine', 'talked', 'how', 'challenging', 'role', 'would', 'be', 'play', 'one', 'lead', 'characters', 'best', 'stepper', 'pulled', 'off', 'quite', 'nicely', 'cracked', 'up', 'when', 'hit', 'up', 'coasts', 'make', 'fun', 'dances', 'man', 'excellent', 'dancer', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'twice', 'so', 'far', 'plan', 'seeing', 'least', 'three', 'more', 'times', 'show', ""'m"", 'telling', 'everybody', 'know', 'go', 'see', 'so', 'far', 'feedback', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'friends', 'family', 'been', 'explosive', 'When', 'Different', 'World', 'came', 'out', 'show', 'helped', 'increase', 'money', 'HBCUs', 'people', 'really', 'wanted', 'learn', 'environment', 'have', 'HBCU', 'experience', 'went', 'see', 'movie', 'someone', 'who', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'say', 'word', 'being', 'interested', 'college', 'yelled', 'never', 'inviting', 'up', 'mine', 'impressive', 'When', 'movie', 'so', 'captivating', 'can', 'make', 'people', 'want', 'go', 'institution', 'experience', 'too', 'when', 'know', 'movie', 'mission', 'succeeded.Cons', 'Absolutely', 'nothing']",Stomp the Yard
