843529,A3DGB4HN3QCGAL,B0002PYT7I,A. Burchfield,"[2, 8]","I've always liked Roswell, and always found that things that started out well were poorly handled before they were finished/dropped.First Season ended with Nasedo taking on the persona of Agent Pierce to protect the kids from the FBI special unit. Second season starts with a few months having gone by and Tess,who lived with Nasedo for 10 years presumably learning a lot about their origins, not teaching the gang anything about their past (evidently they didn't ask either).As the season goes on a lot of interesting plotlines/ ideas are shown to us, all could've been better handled. Last season ended with other aliens on Earth picking up on the signal our guys triggered, were the ""Skins"" these aliens?, I was never clear on that. I kind of liked that ""Summer of '47"" storyline where Michael meets the man who 'saved' the aliens, turns out their were a total of 8 pods & 2 Nasedo types. My biggest personal gripe with that story is that actor Charles Napier was too young to play his character. This story led to the two with the ""Dupes"", the second set of clones- whatever happened to them?- another plot flaw. I always felt like the Tess character was just tossed in late 1st season without sufficient reason, Emilie DeRavin wasn't served very well by how her role was handled in second season. The writers had her all over the place from being one of the gang to being the worst( that subplot with Alex ""going to Sweden"" and then dying in a  Tess mindwarp induced car crash was a mess). The going home episode at season finale was about the only good ""bad Tess"" episode, one of her better moments was the Christmas with the Valenti's segment- Tess was a better ""human"" than they were.The future Max bit was visually interesting but never very well handled, not thru the rest of the series.Michael and Isabel learned about his human donor ancestry and later met the man's granddaughter, that tied in with the plotline of the Gandarium, some sort of lifeform needed to make their bodies freed in the '47 crash and now a threat to the world. All pretty to look at, even interesting, but a lot of loose threads left there.""Viva Las Vegas"" was the dumbest story of the season, Michael felt the need to spend some of that Dupree (granddaughter's family) buy off money so he decides to go off to Vegas, ending up with the whole gang going. Doesn't anybody in that school ever actually go to school?As for the extras in the DVD set- I still don't see the need for going widescreen, looks O.K. but I'd have spent the money on something else. The music?, most of it doesn't matter to me but I see that a lot of it has been changed, again. There are some on set interview bits that are O.K. but not great. Shiri & Majhandra do another commentary bit on this set too, an improvement over first season. The first one was  a vocal commmentary set with one episode for no particular reason, this time it is a separate program altogether. The first one sounded as though they were just rattling on about all three seasons, this one is on a talk show type set and is season specific- it's an improvement.I see that we'll have to wait until next summer for season three. The British got it a month ago, why do we have to wait?",3,"So much potential, so poorly handled- still good stuff",1100131200,"11 11, 2004",2004,3216,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'liked', 'Roswell', 'always', 'found', 'things', 'started', 'out', 'well', 'were', 'poorly', 'handled', 'were', 'finished/dropped.First', 'Season', 'ended', 'Nasedo', 'taking', 'persona', 'Agent', 'Pierce', 'protect', 'kids', 'FBI', 'special', 'unit', 'Second', 'season', 'few', 'months', 'having', 'gone', 'Tess', 'who', 'lived', 'Nasedo', '10', 'years', 'presumably', 'learning', 'lot', 'origins', 'not', 'teaching', 'gang', 'anything', 'past', 'evidently', 'did', ""n't"", 'ask', '.As', 'season', 'lot', 'interesting', 'plotlines/', 'ideas', 'are', 'shown', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'handled', 'Last', 'season', 'ended', 'other', 'aliens', 'Earth', 'picking', 'up', 'signal', 'guys', 'triggered', 'were', 'Skins', 'aliens', 'was', 'never', 'clear', 'kind', 'liked', 'Summer', ""'47"", 'storyline', 'where', 'Michael', 'man', 'who', ""'saved"", 'aliens', 'out', 'were', 'total', '8', 'pods', '2', 'Nasedo', 'types', 'biggest', 'personal', 'gripe', 'story', 'actor', 'Charles', 'Napier', 'was', 'too', 'young', 'play', 'character', 'story', 'led', 'two', 'Dupes', 'second', 'set', 'clones-', 'happened', 'plot', 'flaw', 'always', 'felt', 'Tess', 'character', 'was', 'just', 'tossed', 'late', '1st', 'season', 'sufficient', 'reason', 'Emilie', 'DeRavin', 'was', ""n't"", 'served', 'very', 'well', 'how', 'role', 'was', 'handled', 'second', 'season', 'writers', 'had', 'all', 'place', 'being', 'one', 'gang', 'being', 'worst', 'subplot', 'Alex', 'going', 'Sweden', 'then', 'dying', 'Tess', 'mindwarp', 'induced', 'car', 'crash', 'was', 'mess', 'going', 'home', 'episode', 'season', 'finale', 'was', 'only', 'good', 'bad', 'Tess', 'episode', 'one', 'better', 'moments', 'was', 'Christmas', 'Valenti', 'segment-', 'Tess', 'was', 'better', 'human', 'were.The', 'future', 'Max', 'bit', 'was', 'visually', 'interesting', 'never', 'very', 'well', 'handled', 'not', 'thru', 'rest', 'series.Michael', 'Isabel', 'learned', 'human', 'donor', 'ancestry', 'later', 'met', 'man', 'granddaughter', 'tied', 'plotline', 'Gandarium', 'sort', 'lifeform', 'needed', 'make', 'bodies', 'freed', ""'47"", 'crash', 'now', 'threat', 'world', 'pretty', 'look', 'even', 'interesting', 'lot', 'loose', 'threads', 'left', 'there', 'Viva', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'was', 'dumbest', 'story', 'season', 'Michael', 'felt', 'need', 'spend', 'Dupree', 'granddaughter', 'family', 'buy', 'off', 'money', 'go', 'off', 'Vegas', 'ending', 'up', 'whole', 'gang', 'going', ""n't"", 'anybody', 'school', 'ever', 'actually', 'go', 'school', 'extras', 'DVD', 'set-', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'need', 'going', 'widescreen', 'O.K', ""'d"", 'have', 'spent', 'money', 'something', 'else', 'music', 'most', ""n't"", 'matter', 'see', 'lot', 'been', 'changed', 'again', 'are', 'set', 'interview', 'bits', 'are', 'O.K', 'not', 'great', 'Shiri', 'Majhandra', 'do', 'commentary', 'bit', 'set', 'too', 'improvement', 'first', 'season', 'first', 'one', 'was', 'vocal', 'commmentary', 'set', 'one', 'episode', 'particular', 'reason', 'time', 'separate', 'program', 'altogether', 'first', 'one', 'sounded', 'were', 'just', 'rattling', 'three', 'seasons', 'one', 'talk', 'show', 'type', 'set', 'season', 'specific-', 'improvement.I', 'see', ""'ll"", 'have', 'wait', 'next', 'summer', 'season', 'three', 'British', 'got', 'month', 'ago', 'why', 'do', 'have', 'wait']",N/A

843536,A3KMTOFTUUNFHG,B0002PYT7I,Brett D. Cullum,"[20, 24]","ROSWELL has impressed me to no end.  I avoided it when it was on television, and caught the first DVD set and was blown away.  The first season was simple, had a lot of concentration on the love story, and set the stage for something more dark and intense by its season finale.  Well ... Season Two picks up 3 months after the first, and things definitely pick up into a fever pitch quickly.  The teen aliens now have to deal with new enemies (including ones from space), and grapple with their destinies and assigned roles. Everybody feels the ripples of their discoveries in that first season, and nothing gets resolved until the very last episode.I am troubled by the music replacement (gone are Gomez, U2 and Coldplay), but the show is arguably strong as ever.  The big thing in this second season is a real shift in tone.  Many of the romance elements are lost in favor of some serious Science Fiction / Action episodes.  I noticed a lot of the directors seem to come from BUFFY and ANGEL, so that explains a lot of the focus on action.  There are fewer commentaries in this set, but a bit more features (sorta balances that).  These are great characters, acted very well by a group of good-looking and truly wonderful actors.  The scripts vary, but for the most part remain quite strong throughout.  It has many connections to STAR TREK (even one of its producers was a NEXT GENERATION cast member).  And it also seems to owe a great deal to DAWSON'S CREEK (the romance and teen issues) and BUFFY (the action and mystery as well as fantasy).  Yet it is still its own unique blend of all of these elements in a very outstanding show.

843539,AWIF8AR75LL9L,B0002PYT7I,"Colorgirl ""Spreading color around my world""","[5, 7]","When Roswell was on TV, the first season was wonderful, the second season was, well, worrisome.  When it got to the idiocy of Max and Tess and a baby, well, I stopped watching the show.  It infuriated me that they could desecrate such a decent storyline with such mucky inconsistent lousy sci fi writing.  The team of writers played too much handball with the characters' personalities.When I got to see this collection of shows again one after the other, I could see the inconsistencies and overall bad writing shifts even more glaringly.  It was not until I saw the show's finale that I even wanted to own the last two seasons.Having said that, would I still buy this series again?  The answer is YES if nothing else for the spectacular Christmas episode.  Next to Blind Date (and a few others from season one), it was one of the series' best episodes.  Seems like a full length movie even though it is just about 40 minutes long.The rest of this season is unnecessarily dark, in my opinion.  The plots zig zag and contradict themselves through the season, leaving some ends completely loose that never get explained or resolved.  The writing is too choppy, almost like they were trying to achieve certain things with each episode (more sex, wider audience, better ratings, etc) rather than let the original writers flow with the show, which is what made it so good to begin with.Few shows do well over a several seasons, but the struggling character developement in the second season of Roswell is what carries it through.  It seems like they constantly changed writers because of the gross fluctuations in out-of-character behavior through the second season.  The writing styles of the scripts varied so much that it made the season like an annoying bumpy road that you just wish would be smooth.The best episode of this season which echoes the first season that so many fans loved the show for is the Christmas episode.  That is one of the very few Christmas episodes of any show that we hold dear and want to watch every Christmas.  It was deep, meaningful and the characters gave us a glimpse of what made them to dear to fans in the first season.There are a couple of other episodes in this season that are enjoyable, but there are many that are the kind of dark writing that completely ruined Buffy, which was delightful in the beginning as well, but mutated the show completely.Is this season worth owning?  Yes.  Despite all that I do not enjoy about it, the characters are still strong enough to warrant following the series all of the way through to the end.  The quirky mannerisms and personalities of the characters somehow manage to hang on through all of this and keep us endeared to them through the season.To put it in the words of my mother who is seeing the series for the first time, and is working through season 2, ""Each episode is so dark and sometimes so disoriented that you just want to stop watching it, but then you just have to see what happens to the characters, so you watch one more episode.""The fact that the series ended in the same manner that it began makes it worth while.  The last few episodes bring us back to the type of show that Roswell started out to be.I call the Second Season of Roswell, the ""tunnel season"".  It is dark, you really don't want to be there, but hope that there will be light at the end keeps you walking through instead of giving up.The music changes are barely noticeable unless you are addicted to particular songs and watched videos of the TV shows repeatedly.  I think that they did a great job of substituting the music in the DVD's so far.  The show still is just as good as it was when it was on television.  In fact, I find the music less intrusive than on the TV show.I do wish that the DVD's were packed into a case that you could secure them in, they fall out constantly, and that is frustrating for everyone I know that has any of the seasons in this series.",4,I Would Buy This Only For the Christmas Episode,1110412800,"03 10, 2005",2005,3935,"['When', 'Roswell', 'was', 'TV', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'wonderful', 'second', 'season', 'was', 'well', 'worrisome', 'When', 'got', 'idiocy', 'Max', 'Tess', 'baby', 'well', 'stopped', 'watching', 'show', 'infuriated', 'could', 'desecrate', 'decent', 'storyline', 'such', 'mucky', 'inconsistent', 'lousy', 'sci', 'fi', 'writing', 'team', 'writers', 'played', 'too', 'much', 'handball', 'characters', 'personalities.When', 'got', 'see', 'collection', 'shows', 'again', 'one', 'other', 'could', 'see', 'inconsistencies', 'overall', 'bad', 'writing', 'shifts', 'even', 'more', 'glaringly', 'was', 'not', 'saw', 'show', 'finale', 'even', 'wanted', 'own', 'last', 'two', 'seasons.Having', 'said', 'would', 'still', 'buy', 'series', 'again', 'answer', 'YES', 'nothing', 'else', 'spectacular', 'Christmas', 'episode', 'Next', 'Blind', 'Date', 'few', 'others', 'season', 'one', 'was', 'one', 'series', 'best', 'episodes', 'full', 'length', 'movie', 'even', 'just', 'about', '40', 'minutes', 'long.The', 'rest', 'season', 'unnecessarily', 'dark', 'opinion', 'plots', 'zig', 'zag', 'contradict', 'season', 'leaving', 'ends', 'completely', 'loose', 'never', 'get', 'explained', 'resolved', 'writing', 'too', 'choppy', 'almost', 'were', 'trying', 'achieve', 'certain', 'things', 'episode', 'more', 'sex', 'wider', 'audience', 'better', 'ratings', 'etc', 'rather', 'let', 'original', 'writers', 'flow', 'show', 'what', 'made', 'so', 'good', 'begin', 'with.Few', 'shows', 'do', 'well', 'several', 'seasons', 'struggling', 'character', 'developement', 'second', 'season', 'Roswell', 'what', 'constantly', 'changed', 'writers', 'gross', 'fluctuations', 'out-of-character', 'behavior', 'second', 'season', 'writing', 'styles', 'scripts', 'varied', 'so', 'much', 'made', 'season', 'annoying', 'bumpy', 'road', 'just', 'wish', 'would', 'be', 'smooth.The', 'best', 'episode', 'season', 'first', 'season', 'so', 'many', 'fans', 'loved', 'show', 'Christmas', 'episode', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'Christmas', 'episodes', 'show', 'hold', 'dear', 'want', 'watch', 'Christmas', 'was', 'deep', 'meaningful', 'characters', 'gave', 'glimpse', 'what', 'made', 'dear', 'fans', 'first', 'are', 'couple', 'other', 'episodes', 'season', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'are', 'many', 'are', 'kind', 'dark', 'writing', 'completely', 'ruined', 'Buffy', 'was', 'delightful', 'beginning', 'as', 'well', 'mutated', 'show', 'completely.Is', 'season', 'owning', 'Yes', 'do', 'not', 'enjoy', 'characters', 'are', 'still', 'strong', 'enough', 'warrant', 'following', 'series', 'way', 'end', 'quirky', 'mannerisms', 'personalities', 'characters', 'somehow', 'manage', 'hang', 'keep', 'endeared', 'season.To', 'put', 'words', 'mother', 'who', 'seeing', 'series', 'first', 'time', 'working', 'season', '2', 'episode', 'so', 'dark', 'sometimes', 'so', 'disoriented', 'just', 'want', 'stop', 'watching', 'then', 'just', 'have', 'see', 'what', 'characters', 'watch', 'one', 'more', 'episode', 'fact', 'series', 'ended', 'same', 'manner', 'began', 'worth', 'last', 'few', 'episodes', 'bring', 'back', 'type', 'show', 'Roswell', 'started', 'out', 'be.I', 'call', 'Second', 'Season', 'Roswell', 'tunnel', 'season', 'dark', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'there', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'light', 'end', 'walking', 'instead', 'giving', 'up.The', 'music', 'changes', 'are', 'barely', 'noticeable', 'are', 'addicted', 'particular', 'songs', 'watched', 'videos', 'TV', 'shows', 'repeatedly', 'think', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'substituting', 'music', 'DVD', 'so', 'far', 'show', 'still', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'was', 'when', 'was', 'television', 'fact', 'find', 'music', 'less', 'intrusive', 'TV', 'show.I', 'do', 'wish', 'DVD', 'were', 'packed', 'case', 'could', 'secure', 'fall', 'out', 'constantly', 'frustrating', 'everyone', 'know', 'seasons', 'series']",N/A

At that time, I was working a job that usually occupied my nights, so unless it was Buffy, Ally McBeal or Friends (or something like South Park or Sex And The City that was on cable and repeated during post-prime time hours),  chances are I didn't watch it if it aired between 1998-2002.About a year ago, I was bored and found my roommate watching a marathon Roswell on Sci-Fi, he knew the show from it's WB days,  he talked me into watching an episode with him... and as he got ready for work, I found myself watching the entire 5 hour block of episodes...  and then I found out season one was shortly coming to DVD.  I kept taping the Sci-Fi daily marathons and bought season 1 asap,  and I was able to finish the entire season in barely over a week.  I've seen all 61 episodes and without hesitation would say that after Buffy (my all time favorite series), Roswell is definately the second best show WB has ever aired.Unlike most high school dramas, this show really had great characters, and the series was all about the ensemble.  Even though Max and Liz were the central couple of the series, you found yourself just as fascinated with Michael, Maria, Alex, Isabel, Kyle and Sheriff Valenti.  I was never crazy about the character Tess, and unfortunately season 2 has way too much of her.  Season 2 is probably my least favorite of the 3 seasons because she got on my last nerve.  My favorite character is Maria.I love the characters, love the atmosphere.  I have never been to New Mexico, but from watching Roswell, I feel like I know what it must be like (even tho I know it was filmed in California).Definately a must-buy DVD come October 5.Thank you Jason Katims for turning a small book franchise into a wonderful series,  and thank you Fox for preserving this series on DVD.",4,Self-Slapping,1093132800,"08 22, 2004",2004,1860,"['never', 'saw', 'episode', 'Roswell', 'WB', 'UPN', 'tenures', 'time', 'was', 'working', 'job', 'usually', 'occupied', 'nights', 'so', 'was', 'Buffy', 'Ally', 'McBeal', 'Friends', 'something', 'South', 'Park', 'Sex', 'City', 'was', 'cable', 'repeated', 'post-prime', 'time', 'hours', 'chances', 'are', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'aired', '1998-2002.About', 'year', 'ago', 'was', 'bored', 'found', 'roommate', 'watching', 'marathon', 'Roswell', 'Sci-Fi', 'knew', 'show', 'WB', 'days', 'talked', 'watching', 'episode', 'got', 'ready', 'work', 'found', 'watching', 'entire', '5', 'hour', 'block', 'episodes', 'then', 'found', 'out', 'season', 'one', 'was', 'shortly', 'coming', 'DVD', 'kept', 'taping', 'Sci-Fi', 'daily', 'marathons', 'bought', 'season', '1', 'asap', 'was', 'able', 'finish', 'entire', 'season', 'barely', 'week', ""'ve"", 'seen', '61', 'episodes', 'hesitation', 'would', 'say', 'Buffy', 'time', 'favorite', 'series', 'Roswell', 'definately', 'second', 'best', 'show', 'WB', 'ever', 'aired.Unlike', 'most', 'high', 'school', 'dramas', 'show', 'really', 'had', 'great', 'characters', 'series', 'was', 'ensemble', 'Even', 'Max', 'Liz', 'were', 'central', 'couple', 'series', 'found', 'just', 'fascinated', 'Michael', 'Maria', 'Alex', 'Isabel', 'Kyle', 'Sheriff', 'Valenti', 'was', 'never', 'crazy', 'character', 'Tess', 'unfortunately', 'season', '2', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'Season', '2', 'probably', 'least', 'favorite', '3', 'seasons', 'got', 'last', 'nerve', 'favorite', 'character', 'Maria.I', 'characters', 'love', 'atmosphere', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'New', 'Mexico', 'watching', 'Roswell', 'feel', 'know', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'even', 'tho', 'know', 'was', 'filmed', 'California', '.Definately', 'must-buy', 'DVD', 'come', 'October', '5.Thank', 'Jason', 'Katims', 'turning', 'small', 'book', 'franchise', 'wonderful', 'series', 'thank', 'Fox', 'preserving', 'series', 'DVD']",N/A

At the time, honestly, I never even heard of it.However, a little more than a year ago I bought the first season after reading great reviews about it, and was hooked into the story of the three (now four) alien-human hybrids living among the residents of the famous alien-town of Roswell, New Mexico.While the first season focused a lot on the relationship between Max Evans, one of the aliens, and Liz Parker, a normal human, the second season took a new turn with the arrival (late in the first season) of Tess Harding, another alien, and the realization of just what the four were meant to be.The second season of Roswell was the middle of the three seasons that ran on network television. It was also the last year it ran on the WB, as it moved to UPN for the third and final season (which is due on DVD this summer).After enjoying the first season, the second season was certainly different, but it wasn't a disappointment. The storylines were more alien oriented and tended to be a little darker, but all in all, it was a solid season effort and made me look forward to season three.The three aliens we met in the first episode, Max Evans (Jason Behr), his sister Isabelle (Katherine Heigl) and MIchael Guerin (Brendan Fehr) are joined by Tess Harding (Emilie de Ravin) for the second season. The group finds out late in the first season that they are actually the rulers of their home planet, with Max as king, Tess as queen, Michael as second in command and Isabelle as his wife.While this is their destiny, they continue to pursue relationships with those people in Roswell who know their secret. Those include Liz Parker (Shiri Appleby) who Max healed in the first episode after she was shot, Maria DeLuca (Majandra Delfino), Liz's best friend, Alex Whitman (Colin Hanks), who dies near the end of the season, Sheriff Valenti (William Sadler) who spends much of his time protecting the aliens and his son Kyle (NIck Wechsler) who is also Liz's ex-boyfriend.The attraction between Liz and Max served as the storyline in the first season and their relationship becomes much more complicated in season two. While Max's destiny with Tess is known, he still loves Liz and she has to find a way to make him stop loving her to allow his destiny to be fulfilled. The two actors do a fine job, as the chemistry between the two is amazing and you can see the genuine affection Max has for his human love.Michael and Maria are almost the opposite. They came together in the first season, but are constantly arguing. Their relationship grows much deeper throughout the season and at the end, it is his love for her that keeps him, and eventually, Max and Isabelle, from returning to their home planet.Isabelle and Alex also had a relationship in the first season. Although it wasn't a central story line for much of the season, it did play an important role near the end when Alex was killed in a car crash shortly after the prom. Hanks' career was taking off at the time and the producers found it best to let him pursue other opportunities, which led to his eventual death on the show.Sheriff Valenti and his son became keepers of the alien secret late in season one when Max healed Kyle after he was almost killed. They also welcomed Tess into their home after her guardian was killed by other aliens.

As any true Roswellian fan would respond, &quot;Absolutely nothing!&quot;. &quot;Roswell&quot; was the first TV show I've ever know that had this amazing balance of sci-fi action and drama (especially in the first two seasons). Why? Because the actors pulled it off! The talented cast portrayed sincere emotional performances within a web of confusing, far-reached circumstances that made their stories and romances so real. This show does not only deal with the every day dilemmas of love-angst teens, but issues surrounding the aliens: Max, Isabelle, Tess and Michael and their search for their &quot;real home&quot;. What these aliens discover is that home is not necessarily where you are from, or what one thinks is best for you, home is where you make it. Season 2, explores this journey with the aliens and the humans, where relationships are tested, friendships and trusts are destroyed, but most importantly, where they discover not just where they belong but with who they belong. Season 2 is an amazing follow-up to the spectacular Season 1. It will have you thinking, turning in one direction than the next, it will have you feeling hurt, sorrow, anger and redemption. I won't say more because I don't want to give to much away (like some have done in previous reviews)but know that you will enjoy every look, every discovery snd every adventure this story takes you.

I mean Season one is my favorite (and probably the best) but season two has just as many memorable moments and happenings as the first. It takes the romance and sci-fi action of the first season to a completely new level, which is awesome. Some of the best episodes are in the second season, and a lot of important things in the story happen, like Alex's death, Tess's betrayal, the transaltion of the book that Max, Micheal, Isabel and Tess have been trying to read forever, Valenti lossing his badge and so many more.Season two's story is just so engaging. I think Tess adds so much to the cast, even though you probably hate her (as does everyone else). The story in season one was just mainly eluding cops and federal agents, but season two has so much more. Max and the others aren't just trying to keep their identies hidden from the public, they also have to deal with other aliens, like the skins, who are trying to destroy them. They are also trying to figure out a way to get back home. Max and Liz's relationship is severely strained, as Liz realizes Max is meant to be with Tess, and then distances herself from him. There's even an episode where a Max from the future comes and tells Liz she must help Max fall in love with Tess, or the world will end. That's probably what eventually leads Max to impregnate Tess (accidentally mind you). Max then sees flashes that his child can not survive in earth's atmosphere (in season three you find out those flashes were fake, and Tess was just mind warping him so that he would have to go back to Antar), so he knows that they must all return to their home planet. Right before they leave though, Alex is killed. Liz won't believe it was a suicide, and eventually uncovers that Tess did it. Max is disgusted with her and Tess ends up being the only one to return to their planet. Max holds Liz in his arms as the final episode ends, and we have to wait until the third and final season of the show to find out all the true answers.Season two is still a great season. You can't have one without the other, and I recommend of course buying season one first so that all of it makes sense. Much like the first season, some of the music in some places has been changed due to copyright laws, so that's the one downer. Other than that everything is perfect, and you will undoubtably watch the episodes again and again now that you have them on DVD, and no longer need all those VHS tapes you taped the show on.

I read from a reviewer that some writers from Buffy and Angel worked on this show, but I don't see any of that influence here. That's part of my problem with the show. It's centered on the teenagers but there's so much drama going on and not enough light moments. The show is TOO dark and when they attempt light moments it doesn't work. Another failure is the romance department. Maria and Michael's romance fizzled this season. They're together, but Michael seemed too easy this time around as opposed to his complex character during the 1st season. For Liz and Max, wow. The writers doomed that romance for the second season. Between Tess and Maria's annoying cousin, Sean, hanging around so much, Liz and Max didn't stand a chance. I have to say the addition of Sean DeLuca did NOT help the series. I don't know if its the character or the actor, but I was really bugged by that character. He came on so strong in the beginning which reminded me of the actor's previous portrayal as Julie's rapist boyfriend Zach on ""Felicity"". It was hard to separate the two characters. And I don't know if other fans agree, but there's a big ""Will and Grace"" type problem here as well. On ""W & G"", the co-stars Jack and Karen are the most entertaining characters. The same with Roswell. While I like the characters Liz and Max, I find Maria, Isabelle and Michael MUCH MORE entertaining and intersting than those two. Even Kyle is more interesting than Max.As for the dvd contents, I don't know anything about the music substition. I didn't watch the show in it's original broadcast and anyone else who hasn't won't be able to tell the difference with the music so to newer fans it won't and shouldn't matter.

It almost seemed like a different show for the first half of the season. The love story element between Max and Liz is barely apparent at all in the first half of season two.  For me that is the thing that made season one so special. Season two is much more sci-fi/x-filesish...The aliens battle another group of aliens called the skins, and they also have to keep a alien bacteria from destroying the earths water supply.Now the second half of the season is where everything picks up.  Alex is murdered, Micheal discovers he has a family, Max and Tess ""get it on"" for a lack of a better phrase, and Liz dates around with Maria's cousin. This half of the season sees the group taking a trip to Vegas, having a their first prom, and burying one of their own.I think one of the things I liked most about this season was the decision to make Tess evil.  I mean to be honest everyone hated her from the get go anyway.

All hopeful dreams are shattered and it would seem that shifts in networks, executive interference and the desperate grab to get rating caused the show to concentrate on the more sci-fi elements of the show. The concepts get slighty more gimmicky and the universe opens up as we met other aliens both friends and foe, goppelgangers and the increasing knowledge of an intergalatic war.Furthermore, the foundation of the show, Max and Liz, was torn ...no......shredded apart !!! I for one was screaming at the screen during the episode 'The End Of The World' because for me it was. My instant reaction was one of utter disappointment, betrayl - i felt cheated. Why...why...oh why !!!!!Though did i stop watching ....nup......did i stop enjoying....hell no.....was i emotionally further drawn in to this world ......HELL YEAHHHHHHH !For whatever annoyance i had with the show i couldn't stop watching.....i could not stop being completely sucked in to ever emotional, draining punch that Season Two delivered.Summer of 47 had me suckered punched. The episode was tight, well scripted, a great way to expand the cast's abiltites and all builds to an unexpected and emotionally charged ending that just blew me away. It not like a twist ending or anything but when u know the character and know he wouldn't share his secret for anything, the instance when he does....well it emotional ok :)However this is nothing compared to the aftermath that is episode titled ' Cry Your Name'. Any fan of Season One is gunna feel it here and this is one of the Season's final episodes so by this stage you are already pretty gutted out.These are only but a few of my highlights of Season Two and for all my be-gruding ealier about my annoynances they are a staple of the impact and emotions that I persoanlly feel for this series.In other words, its a credit to the writers as what could they do? Rehash Season One....no...they developed and gave us charaters that we truly love and engage with - my annoynace at the Max - Liz realtionship was due to the impact it had hit me at. Good dramatic televison if u ask me !!!!!There are like 3 part storylines that faulter in Season Two and a more intensive focus put into the action and sci-fi elements. I believe due to this there is a little less magic emmbedded in the shining light that shone over Season One but the characters and development is too intriguing and emotional to let go.The electricty of the characters are still there and so is the range of human interpersonal relations which only Rowellians get.Be prepared for things to change in Season Two, be prepared to be shocked and engaged to one of the most intense 3 part series i have ever seen. Remeber this is Roswell and nothing is gunna be how you thought it would be !!!!!!* I have taken one star of because though still great televison and powerful drama its clear the show started to rely more on the sci-fi angle with more effects and some hokey storylines.

Why? This season is alot more fast paced than season 1 was and focuses mainly on scifi elements for this season and drops the relationship stuff to the side. It is still there. I am just trying to say that this season has more special effects and scifi than relationships. However the show goes back on the human side of the story around the last 5 epsiodes. &quot;Off The Menu&quot; was originally schedule to be airred after &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot; but The WB thought it would be better to put that episode before the season finale. So they did. It is considered a &quot;flashback episode.&quot;Anyway about Season 2, I am not gonna try and give alot away for the newcomers buying the set but here are a few headlines of what happens in season 2.1. There will be a ton of recurring characters in season 2, a ton of them and there will also be alot of deaths in season 2.2. We learn alot more about the 4 aliens3. The 4th episode this season is a very important episode that will forever change the show. Also some important key episodes areCry Your Name -- Someone major dies.Its's Too Late and Its Too Bad and Baby Its You -- ITLAITB is prob everyone's episode they hate. When you watch it you'll know what I mean.4. At the end of this season 2 of the regulars will not be regulars for season 3 (but each of them come back in season 3 for 1 final episode for their character.THats All I think I should say except that I really enjoyed Season 2 and I can't wait to see what the newcomers have to say about it.

Now I was a bit concerned that the second season would not be as good as the first, but to my surprise it was just as good if not better. After 5 days of watching the entire second season on DVD I can still say Roswell is still one of my favorite TV shows. Like the first season, season 2 still has a bit of a love story to it, but goes beyond that and in to a full fledged sci-fi series. I have to say I have never cared much for sci-fi series but Roswell is so much more than just that. Like the wonderful first season, this second season still takes you on a journey. As you go through each episode you still find yourself growing more and more attached to the characters as they go on their own emotional journey and self discovery. For me Season 2 is much more emotional with all the tension between Max and Liz, along with the drama of Tess and the loss of Alex.

843582,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0002PYT7I,Robert Moore,"[8, 9]","Season One of ROSWELL was an utter delight and Season Two often continued in the steps of the previous season despite introduction of new plot lines that ultimately doomed the show to silliness.  What made Season One so compelling was the marvelous dilemma of three (and later four) teenagers being stranded in Roswell, New Mexico, striving for some degree of normalcy in the midst of their unique situation, working to develop relationships, and working to keep their secrets secret.  At the very end of Season One, however, the writers unfortunately revealed that Max, Isabel, Michael, and Tess were, in fact, not just random aliens, but alien royalty, the embodied spirits of deceased alien rulers, hidden away on planet Earth to protect them against their enemies.  The OTHER show, the one about teen aliens trying to fit in and wondering about home, was a very compelling show; the one about King Max was just impossible to take.  I don't know of a show that started so well and ended up hurting itself so much by self-inflicted mistakes (well, Season Four of ANGEL with the Evil Cordy plot would rival it).Mind you, the show was still very enjoyable in even the episodes focusing on alien royalty; it is just that you had to blank a lot of stuff out.  There is no question that the dynamics in the show changed considerably in Season Two.  I personally think giving the aliens a definite identity robbed the show of much of its existential angst.  I think it was more interesting when they didn't know who they were.  But it didn't help that the plot line chosen made so little sense, one of those plot lines that didn't bear thinking about because it became sillier and sillier when contemplated.  For instance, why, if this was such an advanced planet, did they retain a primitive monarchial form of government.  When was an absolute monarchy EVER a model of political enlightenment?  Furthermore, in a form of government featuring monarchial succession, why the fetishization of these particular aliens and why the overwhelming obsession to keep them alive?  It simply didn't make any sense, and should someone reply that it is just a show and that we aren't supposed to focus on such questions, let me just point out that the best shows (like BUFFY) do in fact answer such questions.The show stayed fun when they just let everyone be teenagers.  Things between Liz and Max got terribly complicated when a future Max returns to Roswell to tell Liz that if she and Max get together, the world will eventually come to an end, causing her to break off her relation with Max.  Meanwhile, Michael and Maria continue their on and off and on and off relationship, so that we frequently don't know if they are together or not.  One of the highpoints of Season Two is the way that Michael grows up.  I love it when shows allow their characters to change and grow (one of the greatest of many legacies of BUFFY), and Michael's maturation is probably the finest example of this on ROSWELL.  One character who became progressively less important on the show for off-the-set reasons was Colin Hanks, a relatively minor character on the show whose screen career was beginning to take off.  As a result they wrote him off the show by killing him towards the end of the season.There are, in addition to the very bad alien royalty arc, some other nice story arcs.  I especially liked the one that involved Isabel receiving visions in dreams of a young girl who is being abducted by a masked man, an episode that led to several subsequent episodes.  There were also several great stand alone episodes, including a fun episode that flashbacked to 1947 and the original Roswell crash, with all the show's regulars playing historical characters.  And throughout the season there was considerable enjoyment as the group of very fine characters interacted with one another.  Had they just avoided the terrible royalty arc, the show would almost certainly have been as good as the first season.  As it was, it became a show you continue to enjoy despite having to filter out some plot silliness.My two favorite current shows are VERONICA MARS and LOST and it is interesting that both shows had ties to Season Two of ROSWELL.  The LOST connection is, of course, Emilie de Ravin, who plays the ultimately unlikable Tess but on LOST the quite likable Claire (on ROSWELL I keep yearning for her adorable and natural Australian accent, faking an American accent instead, not always successfully).  VERONICA MARS has two major connections.  During the episodes in which the law authorities look for the girl in Isabel's visions, we are introduced to an African-American FBI agent played by Erica Gimpel, who also plays the mother of Veronica's best friend Wallace on VERONICA MARS.  But the real shock for VERONICA fans comes in the episode in which Alex dies.  The pizza delivery boy, who ends up having a pretty substantial part, is played by Jason Dohring, who plays, of course, Logan Echols on VERONICA, probably the most popular character on the show after Veronica herself.All in all, this is definitely an enjoyable season, though it is by no means as consistently satisfying or as good as the first season.",4,A good season two despite some bad story

843583,A17TRO3RZKDFA9,B0002PYT7I,Sabalom Glitz,"[3, 3]","The series kind of changed direction near the end of the first season. Season 2 continues that change by concentrating a little more on sci-fi elements. Overall this is still a strong season, but I think the move worked to the shoe's detriment. And there are a couple of really weak episodes here, especially ""Meet the Dupes"" and ""Max in the City"". Yikes! On the other hand, there are some great ones, too, particularly ""The End of the World,"" ""A Roswell Christmas Carol,"" and ""Cry Your Name.""Speaking of which, others have commented on the changes in music due to licensing issues. If you're a newcomer to the series, that probably won't make a difference to you except for one instance. The episode ""Cry Your Name"" was titled after a haunting song by Beth Orton. Ron Moore talks at length during the commentary track of that episode about how much he liked the song and why it's so important to the episode. This may leave you scratching your head since the song was replaced with one that completely fails to capture the right mood. Though I'm not pleased by many of the other song changes to the DVDs, in my opinion, this substitution is unforgivable.The widescreen transfers look great, and the 5.1 sound, though not aggressive, is a welcomed addition to a TV show release. Other than some very good commentary tracks, especially by Mr. Moore, the extra features are pretty forgettable.I like this show a lot more than it deserves, I think. Non-Roswellians may watch this and think, ""What's the big deal?"" The second season is not a good starting point for new viewers, but I would recommend this series and this set to anyone who has watched and enjoyed the first season or who is in high school or romanticizes the experience.",4,Cry for the missing song,1163030400,"11 9, 2006",2006,1733,"['series', 'kind', 'changed', 'direction', 'end', 'first', 'season', 'Season', '2', 'change', 'concentrating', 'little', 'more', 'sci-fi', 'elements', 'Overall', 'still', 'strong', 'season', 'think', 'move', 'worked', 'shoe', 'detriment', 'are', 'couple', 'really', 'weak', 'episodes', 'here', 'especially', 'Meet', 'Dupes', 'Max', 'City', 'Yikes', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'great', 'ones', 'too', 'particularly', 'End', 'World', 'A', 'Roswell', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'Cry', 'Name', 'Speaking', 'others', 'have', 'commented', 'changes', 'music', 'due', 'licensing', 'issues', ""'re"", 'newcomer', 'series', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'difference', 'one', 'instance', 'episode', 'Cry', 'Name', 'was', 'titled', 'haunting', 'song', 'Beth', 'Orton', 'Ron', 'Moore', 'talks', 'length', 'commentary', 'track', 'episode', 'how', 'much', 'liked', 'song', 'why', 'so', 'important', 'episode', 'may', 'leave', 'scratching', 'head', 'song', 'was', 'replaced', 'one', 'completely', 'capture', 'right', 'mood', ""'m"", 'not', 'pleased', 'many', 'other', 'song', 'changes', 'DVDs', 'opinion', 'substitution', 'unforgivable.The', 'widescreen', 'transfers', 'look', 'great', '5.1', 'sound', 'not', 'aggressive', 'welcomed', 'addition', 'TV', 'show', 'release', 'Other', 'very', 'good', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'especially', 'Mr.', 'Moore', 'extra', 'features', 'are', 'pretty', 'forgettable.I', 'show', 'lot', 'more', 'think', 'Non-Roswellians', 'may', 'watch', 'think', 'What', 'big', 'deal', 'second', 'season', 'not', 'good', 'starting', 'point', 'new', 'viewers', 'would', 'recommend', 'series', 'set', 'anyone', 'who', 'watched', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'season', 'who', 'high', 'school', 'romanticizes', 'experience']",N/A

I really like the friendships the kids form and how the kids work together in everything they do, good or bad.  The show also has a small town feel, which adds to the appeal. I enjoy every character, but also wish some of the secondary characters had more air time, like Alex and Kyle.  The relationship between Max and Liz is very intense and you always want the best for them.  Michael and Maria had a relationship that always kept you guessing.  The humor was always added at just the right spot.  I think the humor was thanks to Jonathan Frakes directing. He probably added it.  He always seems to have the humor lines in Star Trek.  In the Season 1 DVD, there is commentary on one of the shows from Shiri Appleby (Liz) & Majandra Delfino (Maria).  They tell how Jonathan Frakes tells them how to make certain facial expressions.  He really has a sense of humor, and the girls are both cute and giggly in the commentary.  Everyone will enjoy the DVD's from Season 1 and the extras included.
