The mixed media is not high tech and it shouldn't work but it does. It is like being read a storybook.  Young children will like the visuals and the comforting sound of the reader's voice(s) and that Paddington gets in trouble (like kids do) just because he doesn't understand the consequences of his actions.  The actual humor in the dialogue will usually only be appreciated by adults. Watch these short episodes in order as they are chronological and something in one story may carry over into the next.  I am often shocked at the language of children these days.  Parents should put in this dvd and play it for their very young kids so they would hear and learn an extensive and polite vocabulary. Great for children and world-weary adults.,5,"TAKE BACK YOUR DAUGHTER, IT'S SNOWING  AND SHE HASN'T GOT A DUFFLE COAT",1344384000,"08 8, 2012",2012,805,"['one', 'extra', 'special', 'shows', 'must', 'own', 'mixed', 'media', 'not', 'high', 'tech', 'should', ""n't"", 'work', 'being', 'read', 'storybook', 'Young', 'children', 'will', 'like', 'visuals', 'comforting', 'sound', 'reader', 'voice', 's', 'Paddington', 'trouble', 'kids', 'do', 'just', ""n't"", 'understand', 'consequences', 'actions', 'actual', 'humor', 'dialogue', 'will', 'usually', 'only', 'be', 'appreciated', 'adults', 'Watch', 'short', 'episodes', 'order', 'are', 'chronological', 'something', 'one', 'story', 'may', 'carry', 'over', 'next', 'am', 'often', 'shocked', 'language', 'children', 'days', 'Parents', 'should', 'put', 'dvd', 'play', 'very', 'young', 'kids', 'would', 'hear', 'learn', 'extensive', 'polite', 'vocabulary', 'Great', 'children', 'world-weary', 'adults']",N/A

Now all of the episodes are on DVD and for the first time ever I can watch them all crystal clear on a well put together 3 disc set with great features and classic films I can watch with my daughter and I can play some of the games the DVD-ROM carries with her as well.

I didn't have much reason to be there, other than--even though I am American--I grew up on the books and cartoons of a certain lovable bear from deepest, darkest Peru.  Paddington Bear contributed to my life-long love of marmalade, and had been a big influence on my going to Britain in the first place.I haven't seen these cartoons for decades, but this Mill Creek boxset was too great to resist.  All 56 episodes from the series, on three DVDs for an extremely affordable price. I always loved the style of the animation, with a stop-motion bear existing in a cartoon world.  The simplicity of the animation adds to its charm, as it mirrors the stories that are simple, honest, and full of love.I am a 40-year old guy without any kids, but I am still touched by the magic of Paddington Bear.
