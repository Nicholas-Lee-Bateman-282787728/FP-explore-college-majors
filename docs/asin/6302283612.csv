If you get the opportunity to see it...you must. If you loved Peter Reigert in The Mask, you will flip for him in The Runestone. He provides the comic detective and is fabulous.

Soon a wolf-like monster is preying upon the city's unsuspecting people.  Will a hero emerge to put an end to the murderous beast's rampage?Despite a somewhat elevated reputation amongst b-movies, THE RUNESTONE is a poor movie on most levels.  The plot is actually a very interesting idea, and I'd be curious to read the hard-to-find story by Mark E. Rogers and compare the film to the author's original vision, but in point of fact the film is doomed by a host of problems and bad decisions by the filmmakers.  The script is muddled, and too many illogical things happen underscored by frequently embarrassing dialogue.  The special effects are unconvincing, and the villainous wolf is less realistic than similar creatures from the 50s and 60s.  Even the climax, which could have been a killer showdown between good and evil, is a major letdown devoid of action or drama.  On the plus side, the cast is good (the lovely Joan Severance, plus Peter Riegert, Willaim Hickey, and Tim Ryan) and there is some effort to develop the characters as real people with real problems and personalities.  Despite the pedestrian direction, there is a certain mysterious atmosphere behind it all and the music is of high quality.  The Norse take on traditional werewolf lore is inherently interesting, though sadly it is poorly developed here.THE RUNESTONE is a good idea that never comes to fruition.  Perhaps a revised script and more confident direction could have turned this into a decent movie, but as it is there are just too many weaknesses to overcome.",2,BEWARE THE VIKING WEREWOLF,1230249600,"12 26, 2008",2008,1675,"['giant', 'stone', 'covered', 'arcane', 'markings', 'uncovered', 'deep', 'abandoned', 'cavern', 'long-forgotten', 'prophecy', 'revived', 'Soon', 'wolf-like', 'monster', 'preying', 'city', 'unsuspecting', 'people', 'Will', 'hero', 'emerge', 'put', 'end', 'murderous', 'beast', 'rampage', 'somewhat', 'elevated', 'reputation', 'b-movies', 'THE', 'RUNESTONE', 'poor', 'movie', 'most', 'levels', 'plot', 'actually', 'very', 'interesting', 'idea', ""'d"", 'be', 'curious', 'read', 'hard-to-find', 'story', 'Mark', 'E.', 'Rogers', 'compare', 'film', 'author', 'original', 'vision', 'point', 'fact', 'film', 'doomed', 'host', 'problems', 'bad', 'decisions', 'filmmakers', 'script', 'muddled', 'too', 'many', 'illogical', 'things', 'happen', 'underscored', 'frequently', 'embarrassing', 'dialogue', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'unconvincing', 'villainous', 'wolf', 'less', 'realistic', 'similar', 'creatures', '50s', '60s', 'Even', 'climax', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'killer', 'showdown', 'good', 'evil', 'major', 'letdown', 'devoid', 'action', 'drama', 'plus', 'side', 'cast', 'good', 'lovely', 'Joan', 'Severance', 'Peter', 'Riegert', 'Willaim', 'Hickey', 'Tim', 'Ryan', 'effort', 'develop', 'characters', 'real', 'people', 'real', 'problems', 'personalities', 'pedestrian', 'direction', 'certain', 'mysterious', 'atmosphere', 'music', 'high', 'quality', 'Norse', 'take', 'traditional', 'werewolf', 'lore', 'inherently', 'interesting', 'though', 'sadly', 'poorly', 'developed', 'here.THE', 'RUNESTONE', 'good', 'idea', 'never', 'fruition', 'Perhaps', 'revised', 'script', 'more', 'confident', 'direction', 'could', 'have', 'turned', 'decent', 'movie', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'many', 'weaknesses', 'overcome']",Runestone VHS

I saw it more than a decade ago and it was a funny and less than serious take on the Fenrir myth. But I really liked this take on the myth of Fenrir , the lord of the wolves. In this movie Fenrir is not depicted as a wolf or werewolf at all but rather as a monster which exists on another dimensional plane of existence which had inappropriately been titled 'Asgard'according to the storyline of the film. It's funny and exciting , scary and not so sad , and sometimes seriously sinister for the beginner to watch scary movies.This film has in my view all it takes to make a good movie that can send chills to the bone and has no need to go after the letter. So basically we can say that this film is the brilliant and artistic creation of it's own director and producers. And I loved it the moment I saw it and I always intended to see it........again.So to prevent it from becoming extinct , I chose to give it four stars on amazon.com with the hope that others who saw the movie also and may remember , might give it more or less stars. Very fun movie to watch in my view. I hope I am not doing any damage to his carreer as an actor by mentioning this early movie. I am not sure however if many other viewers of the film were as satisfied as me. May this film be reprinted for us to find out!!!!!!",4,PREVENTING A GREAT FILM FROM BECOMING EXTINCT,1255305600,"10 12, 2009",2009,1389,"['just', 'wanted', 'prevent', 'film', 'reaching', 'fate', 'zealous', 'materialism', 'saw', 'more', 'decade', 'ago', 'was', 'funny', 'less', 'serious', 'take', 'Fenrir', 'myth', 'really', 'liked', 'take', 'myth', 'Fenrir', 'lord', 'wolves', 'movie', 'Fenrir', 'not', 'depicted', 'wolf', 'werewolf', 'rather', 'monster', 'dimensional', 'plane', 'existence', 'had', 'inappropriately', 'been', 'titled', ""'Asgard'according"", 'storyline', 'film', 'funny', 'exciting', 'scary', 'not', 'so', 'sad', 'sometimes', 'seriously', 'sinister', 'beginner', 'watch', 'scary', 'movies.This', 'film', 'view', 'make', 'good', 'movie', 'can', 'send', 'chills', 'bone', 'need', 'go', 'letter', 'So', 'basically', 'can', 'say', 'film', 'brilliant', 'artistic', 'creation', 'own', 'director', 'producers', 'loved', 'moment', 'saw', 'always', 'intended', 'see', '..again.So', 'prevent', 'becoming', 'extinct', 'chose', 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'amazon.com', 'hope', 'others', 'who', 'saw', 'movie', 'also', 'may', 'remember', 'might', 'give', 'more', 'less', 'stars', 'Very', 'fun', 'movie', 'watch', 'view', 'hope', 'am', 'not', 'doing', 'damage', 'carreer', 'actor', 'mentioning', 'early', 'movie', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'however', 'many', 'other', 'viewers', 'film', 'were', 'as', 'satisfied', 'May', 'film', 'be', 'reprinted', 'find', 'out']",Runestone VHS
