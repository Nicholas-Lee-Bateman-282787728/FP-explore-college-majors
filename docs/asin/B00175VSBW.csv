1155847,A14COU5OWHU5RT,B00175VSBW,Allen,"[1, 2]","The only reason why I even wanted to see this movie is cause of Ashley Tisdale, being a big fan of her's, and frankly from the promos i had a feeling this movie would be good but i was wrong... the movie was outright boring, trying to bank on a rather cheesy plot, the movie tries to make a vague attempt at comedy frankly, i didn't find any of the scenes genuinely funny at all, it was more like a ""been there done(seen/heard) that"" kinda story. I certainly didn't like the way the movie started, felt it jump started instead of having a rather gradual beginning, maybe a little more scoop on Mandy's history or her life at school might have been better. The ""Video Phone"" was highlighted a bit too much honestly and one could even consider the movie being a commercial for the phone rather... my only favorite moment in the entire movie was when Ashley sang ""Shadows of the Night"", Ashley is well the only best thing bout the movie, she did a rather remarkable job looking like a nerd and pretty cute too... the supporting cast was good though a disappointing plot really overshadowed their performance, I'll admit though i like her better playing Sharpay or Maddie rather than Mandy, n even though she admitted being able to relate herself to the character very much she does better otherwise... Well this was her first movie as a leading lady n she definitely has a long long way to go... ill keep my eyes open for the day she really ""Bops to the Top""..",3,High school dork falls in love with a popular stud,1275004800,"05 28, 2010",2010,1457,"['only', 'reason', 'why', 'even', 'wanted', 'see', 'movie', 'cause', 'Ashley', 'Tisdale', 'being', 'big', 'fan', 'frankly', 'promos', 'i', 'had', 'feeling', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'i', 'was', 'wrong', 'movie', 'was', 'outright', 'boring', 'trying', 'bank', 'rather', 'cheesy', 'plot', 'movie', 'make', 'vague', 'attempt', 'comedy', 'frankly', 'i', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'scenes', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'was', 'more', 'been', 'done', 'seen/heard', 'story', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'way', 'movie', 'started', 'felt', 'jump', 'started', 'instead', 'having', 'rather', 'gradual', 'beginning', 'maybe', 'little', 'more', 'scoop', 'Mandy', 'history', 'life', 'school', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Video', 'Phone', 'was', 'highlighted', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'honestly', 'one', 'could', 'even', 'consider', 'movie', 'being', 'commercial', 'phone', 'rather', 'only', 'favorite', 'moment', 'entire', 'movie', 'was', 'when', 'Ashley', 'sang', 'Shadows', 'Night', 'Ashley', 'well', 'only', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'did', 'rather', 'remarkable', 'job', 'looking', 'nerd', 'pretty', 'cute', 'too', 'supporting', 'cast', 'was', 'good', 'disappointing', 'plot', 'really', 'overshadowed', 'performance', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'i', 'better', 'playing', 'Sharpay', 'Maddie', 'rather', 'Mandy', 'n', 'even', 'admitted', 'being', 'able', 'relate', 'character', 'very', 'much', 'better', 'otherwise', 'Well', 'was', 'first', 'movie', 'leading', 'lady', 'definitely', 'long', 'long', 'way', 'go', 'ill', 'keep', 'eyes', 'open', 'day', 'really', 'Bops', 'Top', '..']",Picture This

The movie is basically about a girl named Mandy (Ashley Tisdale) who is not very popular in school and who is trying to date Drew Patterson (Robbie Amell).The plan is to attend a big party to which Drew invites her to, but unfortunately as luck would have it she is GROUNDED by her dad for breaking some rules. She later convinces him that she is only going to go to ""study"" with her 2 other friends, but he insists in a BIG BROTHER way that she must check in every 30 minutes via video cell phone on how everything is going. That is when the real fun starts and things start to get real crazy! Mandy must do crazy things every 30 mins to try and make her dad believe she is actually at her friends house studying. The scariest part of the movie was when she is driving and her dad asks her ""is that a horn I hear"" and insists on showing him what she is doing. She takes the keys out of the ignition on a busy road covers her eyes while her friends steer the car. I don't recommend this at home, and it almost getting all three of them killed by nearly hitting a truck head on.There are a lot more crazy things Mandy does to try and fake where she is. You will have to watch the movie to see if her dad finds out what she and her friends did and bust her. I don't want to spoil the fun.I definitely recommend this movie to everyone.

Though, she was being deceitful the entire time and blaming him for not trusting her. The entire movie was spent lying where she was at and making fake videos to show her dad. About 10 minutes maybe involved ""romance"". That was a few minutes in the beginning when she meets the guy, a few seconds in the middle when he calls her, and a few minutes at the end. The dialog was cheesy and the ""mean girls"" plot was ridiculous. Admittedly, the movie gets a little better as it progresses. The opening scenes were awful and I forced myself to watch further and it did get better. Though many of the actresses were ""over acting"". Many exaggerated movements and expressions...but I guess that's what you get with these types of movies nowadays. The best part was the battle of the bands scene.

Not only is she geeky, but her father is a bit of an overprotective control freak and her cell phone is stuck in the dark ages.  She does have two good friends, but that's about it.Since seventh grade, she has had a crush on Drew Patterson (Robbie Amell).  And, the day before her eighteenth birthday, decides to do something about it.  Much to her surprise, it's not as hard as she thought it would be.  He even invites her to be his date at a party he is giving this weekend.However, things take a turn for the worse when her dad (Kevin Pollak) grounds her for almost no reason.  She manages to get a reprieve, but only to study.  Now she must figure out a way to get an outfit and get to the party, all while fooling her dad with her new, flashy camera phone.  But as the situations get out of hand, can she pull it off?From the brief preview I caught on ABC Family, I thought this made for TV movie might be fun.  I was wrong.  Instead of a relaxing hour and a half, I spent the entire time cringing as Mandy moved from one bad experience to another.  I did find a couple scenes amusing, but that was about it.  None of the characters were that sympathetic.  And the moral about parents learning to let go sends a bad message to the intended teen audience.  Despite the fact that the film debuted on ABC Family, I'd give it a strong PG-13 rating for content as well.Those looking for a light movie will be disappointed.

He is Prince Charming. He finally notices her and invites her to his party as his date.

Mandy must race against the clock and get in all sorts of implausible situations to go to the party and fool her overbearing father that she is studying at a friend's house. Between ruined clothes, allergies, towed cars, and a battle of the bands, Mandy has her work cut out for her. But, still to top it all up, the evil rich and popular girl is out to get her.The movie is funny because it has so many implausible situations that you just have to go with it.

The idea seemed cute enough to work, the typical and some say overused idea of the unpopular girl finding her place in the sun alongside the man of her dreams and so on and so forth.However this movie is a mix of 'She's all That' and 'Mean Girls' and not in a any of the good ways.Since Ashley's one of the Disney Channel stars I figured this film would in suit be something suitable for a young girl of say 11(which is apparently the age that is stated on the box for the special features). Now I am twenty and therefore can't personally understand, but this film failed to find it's target audience. Instead of staying clean and cute for the young kids, or deciding to take a more hip and eye-opening approach for the late teens it is all mashed up in the middle with it's curse words, lack of all respect for parents, life threatening driving maneuvers, .. heck I could go on forever. Yet it never takes a serious or in that fact raunchy enough step to be popular with most older teens, especially in comparison to a 'Not Another Teen Movie' or 'Ten Things I Hate About You'.And for a movie that claims to be for '11 years and older',  I'm not so sure the word orgasmic is completely suitable. Not to mention the footlong slit that her friend decided to cut into Mandy's dress to make her look presentable for the 'party of her dreams'.Anyway, It's clear to see this movie was intended to be yet another launching pad for Tisdale, and not much more.
