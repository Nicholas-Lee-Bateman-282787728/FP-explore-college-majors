1586291,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,B0096PBCQG,Dr. James Gardner,"[2, 6]","""Appointment in Berlin"" is a black and white 1943 war spy drama starring George Sanders and Marguerite Chapman.Suave George Sanders (1906-72) appeared in hundreds of films, often as a villain. He's best remembered as film critic Addison DeWitt in ""All About Eve"" (1950) for which he won the Oscar as Best Supporting Actor. Here he plays a British agent posing as an ex-patriot who broadcasts secret information to the Allies under the guise of Nazi prooganda.Marguerite Chapman (1918-1999) plays a German woman who falls in love with Sanders. Chapman was busy in the 40s and then transitioned to TV in the 50s.We know Alan Napier (1903-88) as Batman's butler in the TV series, but he had a distinguished career in more than 100 films and TV movies. He often played a cultured Englishman in films like ""Joan of Arc"" (1948), ""Macbeth"" (1948), and ""A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court"" (1949). Here he plays a British Colonel who recruits Sanders.Gale Sondergaard (1899-1985) won the very first ""Supporting Actress"" Oscar for ""Anthony Adverse"" (1936) and would be nominated again in 1946 for ""Anna and the King of Siam"". She plays an underground fighter. Her film career was ruined in the HUAC witch hunt because of the suspected involvement of her husband, but she transitioned to TV in the late 60s.1943 was an OK year in films - The top grossing films included ""This is the Army"", ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"", ""Song of Bernadette"", ""Coney Island"", and ""Stage Door Canteen"". Other notables included ""The Ox Bow Incident"". The big Oscar winner was ""Going My Way"", and other winners included ""Gaslight"" and ""None But the Lonely Heart""War films were particularly popular - ""Action in the North Atlantic"" with Bogart and Raymond Massey, ""Air Force"" with John Garfield, ""Bataan"" with Robert Taylor and Lloyd Nolan, ""Bombadier"" with Pat O'Brien and Randolph Scott, ""Corvette K-255"" with Randolph Scott, ""Five Graves to Cairo"" with Franchet Tone and Anne Baxter"", ""Hangmen Also Die"" with Brian Donlevy and Walter Brennan, and ""Hitler's Children.""This is an adequate film, but there isn't all that much action or suspense.",2,"Adequate, but lacks action and suspense",1352332800,"11 8, 2012",2012,2119,"['Appointment', 'Berlin', 'black', 'white', '1943', 'war', 'spy', 'drama', 'starring', 'George', 'Sanders', 'Marguerite', 'Chapman.Suave', 'George', 'Sanders', '1906-72', 'appeared', 'hundreds', 'films', 'often', 'villain', 'best', 'remembered', 'film', 'critic', 'Addison', 'DeWitt', 'Eve', '1950', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Here', 'British', 'agent', 'posing', 'ex-patriot', 'who', 'secret', 'information', 'Allies', 'guise', 'Nazi', 'prooganda.Marguerite', 'Chapman', '1918-1999', 'German', 'woman', 'who', 'love', 'Sanders', 'Chapman', 'was', 'busy', '40s', 'then', 'transitioned', 'TV', '50s.We', 'know', 'Alan', 'Napier', '1903-88', 'Batman', 'butler', 'TV', 'series', 'had', 'distinguished', 'career', 'more', '100', 'films', 'TV', 'movies', 'often', 'played', 'cultured', 'Englishman', 'films', 'Joan', 'Arc', '1948', 'Macbeth', '1948', 'Connecticut', 'Yankee', 'King', 'Arthur', 'Court', '1949', 'Here', 'British', 'Colonel', 'who', 'Sanders.Gale', 'Sondergaard', '1899-1985', 'won', 'very', 'first', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'Anthony', 'Adverse', '1936', 'would', 'be', 'nominated', 'again', '1946', 'Anna', 'King', 'Siam', 'underground', 'fighter', 'film', 'career', 'was', 'ruined', 'HUAC', 'witch', 'hunt', 'suspected', 'involvement', 'husband', 'transitioned', 'TV', 'late', '60s.1943', 'was', 'OK', 'year', 'films', 'top', 'grossing', 'films', 'included', 'Army', 'Whom', 'Bell', 'Tolls', 'Song', 'Bernadette', 'Coney', 'Island', 'Stage', 'Door', 'Canteen', 'Other', 'notables', 'included', 'Ox', 'Bow', 'Incident', 'big', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'was', 'Going', 'Way', 'other', 'winners', 'included', 'Gaslight', 'None', 'Lonely', 'Heart', 'War', 'films', 'were', 'particularly', 'popular', 'Action', 'North', 'Atlantic', 'Bogart', 'Raymond', 'Massey', 'Air', 'Force', 'John', 'Garfield', 'Bataan', 'Robert', 'Taylor', 'Lloyd', 'Nolan', 'Bombadier', 'Pat', ""O'Brien"", 'Randolph', 'Scott', 'Corvette', 'K-255', 'Randolph', 'Scott', 'Five', 'Graves', 'Cairo', 'Franchet', 'Tone', 'Anne', 'Baxter', 'Hangmen', 'Also', 'Die', 'Brian', 'Donlevy', 'Walter', 'Brennan', 'Hitler', 'Children', 'adequate', 'film', ""n't"", 'that', 'much', 'action', 'suspense']",Appointment In Berlin

1586294,AOCVPRFNS2IKN,B0096PBCQG,Lover of English,"[3, 3]","My first exposure to George Sanders was as the cousin of Rebecca in the film of that name and it seemed that every time I saw him thereafter he played the same smarmy role.  I was delighted to discover him in various movies of The Saint where he was no longer the villain; however he still displayed a rather world-weary cynicism. Appointment in Berlin is the first movie I've seen in which Sanders plays an idealistic young hero and it was very appealing.  I read somewhere that Sanders didn't enjoy the role of leading man and preferred villainous roles.  Too bad.  He had the same kind of effortless charm that Cary Grant later rode to stardom.I love these 1940s movies.  There is an elegance, and a grace and sophistication about them that is entirely lost in modern movies.  Actresses in 1940s movies particularly portrayed women at their best.  They had beautifully modulated voices, perfect carriage and grace of movement.  They were strong and self-sufficient.  Contrast women as portrayed in 1930s movies where they were fainting damsels or women in 1950s movies where they were twittering, brainless hausfraus.  Women came into their own in the 1940s.  Their men were at war and they had to run the country. During this period actresses worked hard to develop skills and they turned themselves into beautiful and charming creatures.  These 1940s movies are about an idea.  Hitler looked to be overrunning the world and 1940s war movies were about resistance to potential slavery.  They didn't have to be about action and suspense.  Appointment in Berlin can be enjoyed as we watch one idealistic young hero give his life for his country and its ideals.",5,Surprising Idealist,1360454400,"02 10, 2013",2013,1662,"['first', 'exposure', 'George', 'Sanders', 'was', 'cousin', 'Rebecca', 'film', 'name', 'seemed', 'time', 'saw', 'thereafter', 'played', 'same', 'smarmy', 'role', 'was', 'delighted', 'discover', 'various', 'movies', 'Saint', 'where', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'villain', 'however', 'still', 'displayed', 'rather', 'world-weary', 'cynicism', 'Appointment', 'Berlin', 'first', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Sanders', 'idealistic', 'young', 'hero', 'was', 'very', 'appealing', 'read', 'somewhere', 'Sanders', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'role', 'leading', 'man', 'preferred', 'villainous', 'roles', 'Too', 'bad', 'had', 'same', 'kind', 'effortless', 'charm', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'later', 'rode', 'stardom.I', 'love', '1940s', 'movies', 'elegance', 'grace', 'sophistication', 'entirely', 'lost', 'modern', 'movies', 'Actresses', '1940s', 'movies', 'particularly', 'portrayed', 'women', 'best', 'had', 'beautifully', 'modulated', 'voices', 'perfect', 'carriage', 'grace', 'movement', 'were', 'strong', 'self-sufficient', 'Contrast', 'women', 'portrayed', '1930s', 'movies', 'where', 'were', 'fainting', 'damsels', 'women', '1950s', 'movies', 'where', 'were', 'twittering', 'brainless', 'hausfraus', 'Women', 'came', 'own', '1940s', 'men', 'were', 'war', 'had', 'run', 'country', 'period', 'worked', 'hard', 'develop', 'skills', 'turned', 'beautiful', 'charming', 'creatures', '1940s', 'movies', 'are', 'idea', 'Hitler', 'looked', 'be', 'overrunning', 'world', '1940s', 'war', 'movies', 'were', 'about', 'resistance', 'potential', 'slavery', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'action', 'suspense', 'Appointment', 'Berlin', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'watch', 'one', 'idealistic', 'young', 'hero', 'give', 'life', 'country', 'ideals']",Appointment In Berlin

He is used by the British Secret Service to ""cultivate"" a friendship with some Nazis. He ends up in Berlin ""expressing his Pro Nazi and Anti British opinions"" on the radio nightly. He also has some hidden info in his nightly messages. The plot is outlandish but we watch any way to just see how far they can take it in this one. Sanders is very good as the Englishman who is used by the secret service and the Nazis. HIS lady love Ilsa (Marguarite Chapman) is lovely. She lacks any kind of passion either in her work or for Sanders and so we quickly loose interesting her in her. This fun none the less. Half way through we get Gale Sondegard as a ""Pro Nazi"" wife who is really a spy. This movies should have had more of her in it. She steals the show. Sondergard has the INCINCERE down to an art.
