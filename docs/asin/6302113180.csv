In 1990,while on annual hiatus from Roseanne,Goodman and Peter O'Toole filmed this movie directed by David S. Ward,who wrote the screenplay for 1973's THE STING. Goodman plays a Las Vegas entertainer who is sent to England to succeed the king who had just passed away(they both looked alike). Imagine an American ruling England! It's like a foreigner ruling America. Ralph,Goodman's character,was never the right person for the kingdom. But he later changes his mind. Ralph said in one scene,""Back in the States I was doing what I wanted,when and how.""

That does not stop this film from being funny, as long as nothing cerebral is wanted.A tragic accident wipes out most of the British royal family. Genealogist scramble to find the next in line to the throne and ulitimately, to their horror, find Ralph, a loser barfly from Las Vegas played by John Goodman.The culture shock goes beyond European vs. American or even aristocrat vs. plebian. A bigger concern to Ralph is that his life is no longer his own. His tastes in women run towards tarts instead of princesses and his political savvy is nil. Just to keep things complicated, A powerful Lord is scheming to bring about his downfall so that his own family can return to the throne.Although Ralph is lousy at playing the aristocratic pinnacle, he turns out to be a better king than anybody has any right to expect.The humor in this movie is almost always at somebody's expense. Sometimes it is the crass American being portrayed and other times it is the pompous Brits. There are some politically incorrect jabs at other as well but they do not take themselves too seriously. The ranking Brits are played by a first string cast including Peter O'Toole.

Unfortunately for Britain, when one is found it turns out to be Ralph Jones (played by John Goodman), an American lounge singer from far over the wrong side of the tracks. As Lord Percival Graves (John Hurt) schemes to dethrone Ralph I, Fredrick Willingham (Peter O&#8217;Toole) works feverishly to keep Jones&#8217; feet on the straight and narrow. [Color, created in 1991, with a running time of 1 hour, 36 minutes.]As you can tell from the summary above, this is not a movie to be taken seriously! It is outrageously funny, being both outrageous and funny. The downside is that there is one scene where Ralph goes to a strip club, and several women are seen in less than family-oriented clothing (there&#8217;s a joke in there somewhere). So, if you have young children, like me, then you will need to hit stop, and fast-forward past the offending scene, as it is too long to simply cue through.That said, though, for adult viewing, this is a great movie!
