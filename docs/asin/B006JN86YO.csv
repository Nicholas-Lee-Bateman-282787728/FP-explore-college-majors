Some of the Cartoon Network cartoons are a little advanced for some children.,5,Pound Puppies,1365206400,"04 6, 2013",2013,192,"['What', 'can', 'be', 'cutier', 'bunch', 'cartoon', 'dogs', 'something', 'kids', 'can', 'watch', 'Great', 'rainy', 'days', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'cartoons', 'are', 'little', 'advanced', 'children']",Pound Puppies: Homeward Pound

The new Pound Puppies is a totally different animation of the puppies but still cute.  With talking animated dogs you really can't go wrong!  The episodes are fun and the dogs made all of us laugh.  The show is about a ""pup for every person"" and shows kids great lessons!  We have watched the DVD a few times now and it has yet to get old for us.",4,Brought back memories!,1331596800,"03 13, 2012",2012,470,"['loved', 'Pound', 'Puppies', 'when', 'were', 'childhood', 'great', 'have', 'come', 'back', 'new', 'generation', 'new', 'Pound', 'Puppies', 'totally', 'different', 'animation', 'puppies', 'still', 'cute', 'talking', 'animated', 'dogs', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'episodes', 'are', 'fun', 'dogs', 'made', 'show', 'pup', 'person', 'kids', 'great', 'lessons', 'have', 'watched', 'DVD', 'few', 'times', 'now', 'yet', 'get', 'old']",Pound Puppies: Homeward Pound

From what i've ""researched"" there are 5 episodes on this dvd, here they are:Episode 8- My Fair ReboundEpisode 9- QuintupletsEpisode 11- Homeward PoundEpisode 15- ZoltronEpisode 19- The K-9 Kidthese are very good episodes and i'm going to order this as soon as i get money!! GO POUND PUPPIES!! if ur as much of a fan as i am (and i'm a HUGE fan!!) then preorder this dvd NOW!!!UPDATE:Ok, i recieved my copy of the Pound Puppies Homeward Pound DVD April 21, 2012 and it's AWESOME!! The back contains 1 pic of episode 2 which is NOT included in this DVD set. This dvd contains Homeward Pound (ep 11), My Fair Rebound (ep 8), Quintuplets (ep 9), The K-9 Kid (ep 19), and Zoltron (ep 15) (in that order). It comes with a bonus feature which is a character artist showing you how to draw Lucky DIRECTLY IN THE STUDIO!! Also on the back, the show is rated TV-Y7 (it's original rating) and the characters on the back are a little paler than usual. Plus they add Mr. NutNut as part of the team (when, technically, he's NOT!!). But, on the plus side, it comes with the FULL version of the very 1st Pound Puppies ad on the hub and its AMAZING!! it also comes with the very 1st ad for My Little Pony as well. The menu, when it starts opens with the Pound Puppies theme song beginning, but with end credit audio. The menu itself is animated using 9 Story Entertainment (even the select episodes part!!). The only thing in the menu that Studio B animated was just a picture for the How to Draw Lucky part of the DVD (even though the eps are from Studio B). Well, that's my review and this DVD deserves 5-stars!!",5,AWESOME!!!!,1326758400,"01 17, 2012",2012,1733,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'Pound', 'Puppies', 'series', 'day', '1', 'when', 'saw', 'dvd', 'was', 'coming', 'out', 'i', 'practically', 'died', 'joy', 'what', 'i', ""'ve"", 'researched', 'are', '5', 'episodes', 'dvd', 'here', 'are', 'Episode', '8-', 'My', 'Fair', 'ReboundEpisode', '9-', 'QuintupletsEpisode', '11-', 'Homeward', 'PoundEpisode', '15-', 'ZoltronEpisode', '19-', 'K-9', 'Kidthese', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'episodes', 'i', ""'m"", 'going', 'order', 'as', 'soon', 'i', 'get', 'money', 'GO', 'POUND', 'PUPPIES', 'ur', 'much', 'fan', 'i', 'am', 'i', ""'m"", 'HUGE', 'fan', 'then', 'preorder', 'dvd', 'NOW', 'UPDATE', 'Ok', 'i', 'recieved', 'copy', 'Pound', 'Puppies', 'Homeward', 'Pound', 'DVD', 'April', '21', '2012', 'AWESOME', 'back', '1', 'pic', 'episode', '2', 'NOT', 'included', 'DVD', 'set', 'dvd', 'Homeward', 'Pound', 'ep', '11', 'My', 'Fair', 'Rebound', 'ep', '8', 'Quintuplets', 'ep', '9', 'K-9', 'Kid', 'ep', '19', 'Zoltron', 'ep', '15', 'order', 'bonus', 'feature', 'character', 'artist', 'showing', 'how', 'draw', 'Lucky', 'DIRECTLY', 'IN', 'THE', 'STUDIO', 'Also', 'back', 'show', 'rated', 'TV-Y7', 'original', 'rating', 'characters', 'back', 'are', 'little', 'paler', 'usual', 'add', 'Mr.', 'NutNut', 'part', 'team', 'when', 'technically', 'NOT', 'plus', 'side', 'FULL', 'version', 'very', '1st', 'Pound', 'Puppies', 'ad', 'hub', 'AMAZING', 'also', 'very', '1st', 'ad', 'My', 'Little', 'Pony', 'as', 'well', 'menu', 'when', 'Pound', 'Puppies', 'theme', 'song', 'beginning', 'end', 'credit', 'audio', 'menu', 'animated', 'using', '9', 'Story', 'Entertainment', 'even', 'select', 'part', 'only', 'thing', 'menu', 'Studio', 'B', 'animated', 'was', 'just', 'picture', 'How', 'Draw', 'Lucky', 'part', 'DVD', 'even', 'eps', 'are', 'Studio', 'B', 'Well', 'review', 'DVD', '5-stars']",Pound Puppies: Homeward Pound
