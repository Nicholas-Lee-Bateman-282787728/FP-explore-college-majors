1070692,A6YUGE5IOB2VP,B000PFUANC,Barry Allen,"[11, 11]","While season one of The Incredible Hulk was rushed by CBS and at times stumbled in trying to find its groove, season two establishes a formula that remains constant for the duration of season two's 22 episodes.Gone are the days of Banner getting his butt kicked, or being tied up and thrown into a pit, or combine, or wrestling cage. Instead, Banner's life is threatened maybe once or twice this season, and the majority of these episodes deal with Banner helping someone in peril: a woman with a debilitaing illness (Married), an alcoholic (Alice in Disco Land), and a derranged writer (No Escape).While most of the episodes end with The Hulk exacting revenge on several of his tormentors,  ""A Child In Need"" focuses on one individual whom The Hulk teaches quite a lesson. An episode leftover from season one, ""A Child in Need"" was almost not aired by CBS at the time due to its rather sensitive content (child abuse). In the end, The Hulk gives the episode's antagonist a taste of his own medicine.  No multiple bad guys, no police, just The Hulk and his adversary mono y mono. The end result is perhaps the most powerful scene in the entire five year run of the show that still strikes an emotional cord 30 years later.The only real less than stellar episodes for the season are ""Wildfire,"" ""A Solitary Place,""  and the season finale ""Vendetta Road.""  By the end of this season, The Hulk's TV popularity was unquestionable. Although there are some exceptional episodes from seasons three and four, this was as good as The Hulk would get as far as overall season quality goes. For the 1979-80 season, the writers began to tinker with the formula, and the results were sometimes less than spectacular.",5,The Hulk at its best!,1179100800,"05 14, 2007",2007,1702,"['season', 'one', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'was', 'rushed', 'CBS', 'times', 'stumbled', 'trying', 'find', 'groove', 'season', 'two', 'formula', 'constant', 'duration', 'season', 'two', '22', 'episodes.Gone', 'are', 'days', 'Banner', 'getting', 'butt', 'kicked', 'being', 'tied', 'up', 'thrown', 'pit', 'combine', 'wrestling', 'cage', 'Instead', 'Banner', 'life', 'threatened', 'maybe', 'once', 'twice', 'season', 'majority', 'episodes', 'deal', 'Banner', 'helping', 'someone', 'peril', 'woman', 'debilitaing', 'illness', 'Married', 'alcoholic', 'Alice', 'Disco', 'Land', 'derranged', 'writer', 'No', 'Escape', '.While', 'most', 'episodes', 'end', 'Hulk', 'exacting', 'revenge', 'several', 'tormentors', 'Child', 'Need', 'one', 'individual', 'whom', 'Hulk', 'quite', 'lesson', 'episode', 'leftover', 'season', 'one', 'Child', 'Need', 'was', 'almost', 'not', 'aired', 'CBS', 'time', 'due', 'rather', 'sensitive', 'content', 'child', 'abuse', 'end', 'Hulk', 'episode', 'antagonist', 'taste', 'own', 'medicine', 'No', 'multiple', 'bad', 'guys', 'police', 'just', 'Hulk', 'adversary', 'mono', 'y', 'mono', 'end', 'result', 'perhaps', 'most', 'powerful', 'scene', 'entire', 'five', 'year', 'run', 'show', 'still', 'emotional', 'cord', '30', 'years', 'later.The', 'only', 'real', 'less', 'stellar', 'episodes', 'season', 'are', 'Wildfire', 'A', 'Solitary', 'Place', 'season', 'finale', 'Vendetta', 'Road', 'end', 'season', 'Hulk', 'TV', 'popularity', 'was', 'unquestionable', 'are', 'exceptional', 'episodes', 'seasons', 'three', 'four', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'Hulk', 'would', 'get', 'as', 'far', 'overall', 'season', 'quality', '1979-80', 'season', 'writers', 'began', 'tinker', 'formula', 'results', 'were', 'sometimes', 'less', 'spectacular']",The Incredible Hulk: The Complete Second Season

1070694,AJ3AFY1JZHD7Q,B000PFUANC,Classic Lover,"[10, 11]","Incredible Hulk season 2 is best Hulk season ever , in my opinion. Yes, season 1 had two part pilot movie and many classic episodes. (Hulk breaks Las Vegas is my personal favorite) Season 3 is another great season but weaker efforts are some of the worst Hulk episodes ever. Season 4 is possibly second best season for Incredible Hulk series. You have two part classic episode PROMETHEUS and another memorable two parter THE FIRST is also one of season 4's highlights. But, no other season can't touched season 2. This season had two of the best Hulk episodes ever and other episodes are all noteworthy and some of them is truly incredible.Season 2's highlights are two two-part episodes. MARRIED is most emotional Hulk episode, and this is indeed touching, unforgettable episode. Also, this episode was Emmy-award winner (best actress category for tv series) I love this episode. Another two parter MYSTERY MAN is one of the best episodes in entire Hulk series. David Benner and Jack Mcgee met and their weird situations really progressed, viewer never expecting what happen will be next, and results are truly memorable. Don't miss this essential episode.Season 2 had many more one hour classic episodes. A CHILD IN NEED, STOP THE PRESSES (also appearing as a bonus feature for Hulk season 1 dvd set), ALICE IN DISCO LAND are all entertaining, sometimes very touching episodes. But, actually there're no weaker efforts in season 2. Entire season is full of well-made, well-written episodes. And, without a doubt season 2 is my choice for best Incredible Hulk season.Season 1 is great collection and quality is very good. I hope season 2 is same kind of high quality product, and very happy episodes like MARRIED, MYSTERY MAN and A CHILD IN NEED are finally releasing dvd collection.

Unfortunately, trouble finds him as a fellow doctor seeks her own refuge.Like A Brother - A battle between a local preacher and a drug dealer brings The Hulk into the fray! I personally call this one ""Hulk In Da Hood!"" LOL!Disc FourThe Haunted - While working as a moving man, David finds a young woman haunted by a childhood tragedy.Mystery Man, Pt. 1 - In this legendary two-parter, David suffers a bout of amnesia due to a car accident as well as facial burns.

Another pivitol and legendary show from the series.Overall, a very good purchase!",5,The Incredible Journey Continues With Arguably Its Strongest Season!,1184544000,"07 16, 2007",2007,4236,"['seasons', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'had', 'share', 'good', 'great', 'eppys', 'season', '2', 'was', 'arguably', 'strongest', 'classics', 'Married', 'Mystery', 'Man', 'as', 'well', 'good', 'episodes', 'A', 'Child', 'Need', 'Antowuk', 'Horror', 'Rainbow', 'End', 'Path', 'Here', 'what', ""'ll"", 'see', 'Disc', '1Married', 'One', 'legendary', 'episodes', 'whole', 'series', 'Here', 'see', 'Dr', 'Banner', 'travel', 'Hawaii', 'consult', 'Dr.', 'Carolyn', 'Fields', 'condition', 'relationship', 'doctor/patient', 'love', 'tragedy', 'gripping', 'two', 'hour', 'episode', 'Bonus', 'commentary', 'was', 'originally', 'featured', 'eppy', 'Kenneth', 'Johnson', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'Original', 'Television', 'Movie', 'also', 'release.The', 'Antowuk', 'Horror', 'encounter', 'Hulk', 'local', 'resident', 'create', 'own', 'Hulk', 'try', 'increase', 'tourist', 'dollars.Ricky', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'young', 'man', 'duped', 'driving', 'defective', 'car', 'demolition', '2Rainbow', 'End', 'Seeing', 'how', 'special', 'indian', 'compound', 'worked', 'calm', 'wild', 'horse', 'Dr', 'Banner', 'remedy', 'own', 'terrible', 'condition', 'also', 'must', 'prevent', 'murder', 'same', 'horse.A', 'Child', 'Need', 'working', 'gardner', 'David', 'abused', 'child', 'trying', 'investigate', 'child', 'father', 'Hulk', 'own', 'lesson', 'abusive', 'parent.Another', 'Path', 'traveling', 'David', 'Li', 'Song', 'blind', 'martial', 'artist', 'own', 'techniques', 'may', 'be', 'path', 'controling', 'Hulk.Alice', 'Disco', 'Land', 'Dr', 'Banner', 'child', 'past', 'who', 'now', 'adult', 'drinking', 'problem.Killer', 'Instinct', 'David', 'football', 'player', 'named', 'Johnny', 'own', 'aggression', 'control', 'football', 'field.Disc', 'ThreeStop', 'Presses', 'young', 'reporter', 'questionable', 'means', 'gain', 'story', 'local', 'restaurant', 'David', 'stop', 'story', 'one', 'pictures', 'clear', 'shot', 'could', 'expose', 'Escape', 'Los', 'Santos', 'traveling', 'west', 'David', 'framed', 'accomplice', 'woman', 'who', 'also', 'innocent', 'murder', 'own', 'husband', 'Wildfire', 'saboteur', 'tries', 'stop', 'drilling', 'oil', 'site', 'Hulk', 'intervenes.A', 'Solitary', 'Place', 'David', 'Mexico', 'find', 'solitude', 'order', 'avoid', 'changing', 'green', 'alter-ego', 'Unfortunately', 'trouble', 'fellow', 'doctor', 'own', 'refuge.Like', 'A', 'Brother', 'battle', 'local', 'preacher', 'drug', 'dealer', 'Hulk', 'fray', 'personally', 'call', 'one', 'Hulk', 'Da', 'Hood', 'LOL', 'Disc', 'FourThe', 'Haunted', 'working', 'moving', 'man', 'David', 'young', 'woman', 'haunted', 'childhood', 'tragedy.Mystery', 'Man', 'Pt', '1', 'legendary', 'two-parter', 'David', 'bout', 'amnesia', 'due', 'car', 'accident', 'as', 'well', 'facial', 'burns', 'only', 'link', 'memory', 'enemy', 'Jack', 'McGee', 'Mystery', 'Man', 'Pt', '2', 'traveling', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'David', 'Jack', 'plane', 'crashes', 'down', 'wilderness', 'two', 'men', 'are', 'fighting', 'nature', 'forrest', 'fire', 'Also', 'McGee', 'gains', 'huge', 'clue', 'identity', 'Hulk', 'Disciple', 'follow', 'up', 'Path', 'David', 'ailing', 'Li', 'Sung', 'police', 'officer', 'see', 'blind', 'man', 'wisdom', 'officer', 'played', '80', 'rock', 'star', 'Rick', 'Springfield.No', 'Escape', 'Hulk', 'accidentally', 'deranged', 'man', 'escape', 'custody', 'Now', 'must', 'correct', 'error.Disc', 'FiveKindred', 'Spirits', 'David', 'up', 'expedition', 'may', 'hold', 'clue', 'how', 'control', 'cure', 'transformations', 'Guest', 'young', 'Kim', 'Catrell', 'long', 'Sex', 'City', 'days', '.The', 'Confession', 'lonely', 'man', 'encounter', 'Hulk', 'be', 'creature', 'alter-ego', 'Quiet', 'Room', 'David', 'doctor', 'who', 'mind', 'control', 'control', 'patients.Vendetta', 'Road', 'young', 'couple', 'tries', 'bring', 'down', 'oil', 'company', 'believe', 'was', 'responsible', 'loved', 'one', 'death.Bonus', 'Episode', 'Homecoming', 'taste', 'Season', '3', 'see', 'David', 'revealing', 'father', 'sister', 'fact', 'alive', 'Meanwhile', 'local', 'tycoon', 'David', 'dad', 'give', 'up', 'land', 'can', 'build', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'including', 'murder', 'see', 'happen', 'pivitol', 'legendary', 'show', 'series.Overall', 'very', 'good', 'purchase']",The Incredible Hulk: The Complete Second Season

1070698,A2LIA72DQFN9M0,B000PFUANC,indijo,"[3, 4]","I have a strong affinity for Banner and the Hulk and I am looking forward to season 3. Hope it comes out real soon, like later this spring or early this summer. I have some experience with being on the road, looking for a place to work and a secure place to sleep. It's not easy and it isn't getting easier. Staying out of jail is much more difficult today than it was 30 years ago. Cops everywhere will shake you down and try to plug something on you if you're alone on the road.Walking alone is becoming more dangerous all the time, at least in the suburbs and the country. I suppose that's one of the reasons why I like series like the Incredible Hulk and the Fugitive (David Jansen); because I experienced some of that kind of freedom for a short time in the 80s and I know that it is fading away. Of course, being a fugitive on the run from nosey reporters and the law can be a problem, but at the same time, being on the open road going across the country without a true, secure destination is also the epitome of American freedom.Believe it or not, I have some envy for Banner, despite his problem with the Hulk. I envy him because, while he is compelled by his situation to run from the NR reporter Jack McGee, he is also a very capable professional man with some very helpful skills, the kind that not only make friends but also impress the ladies. That's more than I had when i was out there in the 80s. If it wasn't the Hulk getting him out of a dangerous situation, it was his professional skills.Season two had somewhat of a slow start, imo, after the very romantic episode, Married, in Hawaii with Caroline (Mariette Hartley). The episodes following were okay, but I didn't really care for the main themes all that much. They were basically just situations where Banner took some low-profile jobs and got messed up with the local dunderheads. If I found myself in such situations I'd just get the hell out of town asap, but that's me. Banner, ot-oh, had to play the good samaritin and get in over his head.A Child in Need and Alice in Disco Land were okay, but obviously more human interest social statements than anything else, with the Hulk simply filling in the action scenes. Obviously, both wife and child-battering husbands and teenage alcoholism were becoming much more open for discussion at that time. Unfortunately, it was about 5 years too late for my family. Of course, the federally-mandated Christian-right solution was to blame it all on marijuana -- go figure!The season got much more interesting after Stop the Press, an episode in which he ran into trouble while working as a dishwasher in a Chicago restaurant, with a dirty reporter working for the National Register, whose desk was just an elbow away from Jack McGee. Imo, this was one of the best episodes of the season, and the season on the whole improved quite a lot after it. Escape from Los Santos was okay, especially the scene where he broke out of the local jail after the crooked cops nailed him to implicate him for murder. It's always nice to see the Hulk get him out of the really tight situations. I enjoyed A Solitary Place, probably more than most, because I tried to live like that once and it brought back some memories.Other episodes of this season that I enjoyed were The Haunted, about a schizoid girl that employs Banner to help her make a move back to her late folk's country estate, treading upon deep, dangerous roots from her forgotten past; Mystery Man, a 2-part episode that begins with an accident that causes Banner to lose his memory and with a bandage over his burnt face, unknowingly joins Jack McGee in a cross-country venture to regain it; No Escape, about another schizoid man suffering from hallucinations, who leaks to Banner his desire to kill his wife and his doctor; The Quiet Room, about Banner working as an orderly in a psyhiatric institution when he gets too close to a doctor's secret mind-control experiments; The Confession, about a nerdy computer technician who witnesses Banner's Hulk eruption and takes the story directly to the National Register, while claiming he is the Hulk, looking for attention and seeking fame; and Vendetta Road, about an angry young man and his girlfriend seeking revenge upon a huge oil monopoly that has been buying up all the local gas-stations and forcing others out of business.Of the 22 episodes, I liked 14.

It doesn't matter if there's the yellow sticker that says FREE MOVIE TICKET TO SEE THE INCREDIBLE HULK. Because you missed it. The ticket is by far not the only reason to buy the set. In fact the series is better than the movie. This is one great tv show with outstanding episodes such as ""Married"" ""Ricky"" ""A Child In Need"" and ""Mystery Man"" Parts 1 and 2. These are just some of my favorites. A total of 22 episodes on five single sided discs. That's single sided. Includes three bonus features. Commentary by Ken Johnson on 'Married"" An introduction by Kenneth Johnson which is a seven minute retrospective of the series. And a season 3 episode. ""Homecoming"".

It isn't as bad as TV today which is Judge Judy in space, basically.(Knight Rider with Mike and the she-bitch/Flash Goiter/Adlantis whatever) that isn't even fun.  Basically in this late '70's PC romp, it was ""Grand Funk Railroad"" doing a political movement(with the Hulk in place of Funk) about drinking and child molesting or stalking librarians with perverted cops.(which I was frankly, sick of even when I was like 10).  Still it is funny, like a reviewer here stated because of this, you can't really take this stuff seriously.  You can be serious about a purchase as you would ""Star Trek Season 3"" for the same reason, it's rediculous.  Fameous comedians parody this stuff, it is the (only) basis of thier material.

True, in the first season the show was struggling to find it's groove and an overall tone was absent and it seemed pretty incredible how David was constantly finding himself in life threatening situations.  But in their experimentations the creators came up with some very good and thrilling episodes.The Second Season makes amends for some things that didn't go well the first time around.  For example, David doesn't need to be in life threatening situations for the Hulk to surface.  In fact, in an episode called The Antowuk Horror David transforms simply because he gets extremely irritated.  That set a good tone for how much of a curse his condition really is.  And you see this pop up on occasion during the second season.  Another thing the show betters here; it finds it's raison d'etre (i.e. socially conscious).  You could easily see in the first season that the creators had more brainpower than simply having the Hulk pop up and wreck things.  More energy was put into David Banner and his lonely quest for a cure and some shows featured very strong storylines and some were really dramatic.Many episodes here focus on social matters;  Alcoholism, mental illness, societal alienation, corrupt megacompanies, the Harlem ghetto, child abuse and more.  Those deep storylines make for very entertaining 45+ minutes and you can't but admire the effort of the writing team and they're ability to conjur up interesting story lines, since the shows always change scenery and subject matter.The Second does have some definite highlights.  Married is one of the best episodes I've seen so far, totally captivating and the tragic storyline moved me very much.  Top notch acting from Bixby and Mariette Hartley and the desert Hulk scenes look spectacular.  A Child In Need is great as well, has a difficult subject matter but handles it mostly very well. Great Hulk scenes in that episode too.  And let's not forget Mystery Man, the two parter where we really get to know Jack McGee and his reasons for pursuing the Hulk as relentlessly as he does.  Jack Colvin owns that episode, but then he's always good.Not every Season 2 episode is a classic but most of them are good and some are outstanding.",4,Socially Conscious Green Giant,1199923200,"01 10, 2008",2008,2389,"['Many', 'say', 'Second', 'Season', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'best', 'overall', ""'m"", 'not', 'qualified', 'judge', 'so', 'far', 'have', 'say', 'pretty', 'good', 'not', 'much', 'better', 'First', 'Season', 'True', 'first', 'season', 'show', 'was', 'struggling', 'find', 'groove', 'overall', 'tone', 'was', 'absent', 'seemed', 'pretty', 'incredible', 'how', 'David', 'was', 'constantly', 'finding', 'life', 'threatening', 'situations', 'experimentations', 'creators', 'came', 'up', 'very', 'good', 'thrilling', 'episodes.The', 'Second', 'Season', 'amends', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'well', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'example', 'David', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'life', 'threatening', 'situations', 'Hulk', 'surface', 'fact', 'episode', 'called', 'Antowuk', 'Horror', 'David', 'transforms', 'simply', 'extremely', 'irritated', 'set', 'good', 'tone', 'how', 'much', 'curse', 'condition', 'really', 'see', 'up', 'occasion', 'second', 'season', 'thing', 'show', 'here', 'raison', ""d'etre"", 'i.e', 'socially', 'conscious', 'could', 'easily', 'see', 'first', 'season', 'creators', 'had', 'more', 'brainpower', 'simply', 'having', 'Hulk', 'pop', 'up', 'wreck', 'things', 'More', 'energy', 'was', 'put', 'David', 'Banner', 'lonely', 'quest', 'cure', 'shows', 'featured', 'very', 'strong', 'storylines', 'were', 'really', 'dramatic.Many', 'episodes', 'here', 'focus', 'social', 'matters', 'Alcoholism', 'mental', 'illness', 'societal', 'alienation', 'corrupt', 'megacompanies', 'Harlem', 'ghetto', 'child', 'abuse', 'more', 'deep', 'storylines', 'make', 'very', 'entertaining', '45+', 'minutes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'admire', 'effort', 'writing', 'team', ""'re"", 'ability', 'conjur', 'up', 'interesting', 'story', 'lines', 'shows', 'always', 'change', 'scenery', 'subject', 'matter.The', 'Second', 'have', 'definite', 'highlights', 'Married', 'one', 'best', 'episodes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'far', 'totally', 'captivating', 'tragic', 'storyline', 'moved', 'very', 'much', 'Top', 'notch', 'acting', 'Bixby', 'Mariette', 'Hartley', 'desert', 'Hulk', 'scenes', 'look', 'spectacular', 'Child', 'Need', 'great', 'as', 'well', 'difficult', 'subject', 'matter', 'mostly', 'very', 'well', 'Great', 'Hulk', 'scenes', 'episode', 'too', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'Mystery', 'Man', 'two', 'parter', 'where', 'really', 'get', 'know', 'Jack', 'McGee', 'reasons', 'pursuing', 'Hulk', 'as', 'relentlessly', 'Jack', 'Colvin', 'episode', 'then', 'always', 'good.Not', 'Season', '2', 'episode', 'classic', 'most', 'are', 'good', 'are', 'outstanding']",The Incredible Hulk: The Complete Second Season

was 6 years old in the 1st grade and how I always used to look forward to watching this show every weekend when it was part of CBS's Friday night line-up with WONDER WOMAN at 8PM, THE INCREDIBLE HULK at 9PM, and DALLAS at 10PM, but at one point CBS had briefly moved THE INCREDIBLE HULK to Wednesdays back in the Winter of 1979 when THE DUKES OF HAZZARD made its debut on CBS, but was moved back to Fridays in the Spring of 1979.I just wish Universal had provided each episodes original air-date like Universal did with the first 3 seasons of KNIGHT RIDER, MAGNUM, & THE A-TEAM for instance & just like Warner Bros. did with CHiPs, WONDER WOMAN, and THE DUKES OF HAZZARD too.For instance, the original air-dates to each of these 1978-1979 Season episodes on CBS were9/22/78-MARRIED9/29/78-THE
