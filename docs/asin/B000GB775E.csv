1001298,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000GB775E,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","I, like many, figured that this film was going to be disastrous.  Lindsay Lohan has not really had a good track record as of late with her film choices.  The last time she made something that wasn't wholly cheesy was in 2004 when she made the brilliant `Mean Girls', and even then it was her co-star Rachel McAdams who stole every scene.  Since then though, Lindsay has kind of fallen into patterns of obscurity, making one bad teen flick after another.  Now, `Just My Luck' is not a complete departure from that mold (it's not like this is a `smart' comedy) but it does lose a lot of the childish overtones for some genuinely funny moments.The film follows Ashley Albright, a successful young woman who is unbelievably lucky.  Everything just seems to fall into line for her making her life a walk in the park.  Jake Hardin is her polar opposite.  Nothing he does turns out right.  He is inherently unlucky.  He works a dead end job at a bowling alley and tries fervently to get one of the local bands signed by a record label to no avail.That is all until one fateful masquerade ball when, after an unexpected kiss, Ashley and Jake find themselves swapping luck.Quickly things fall apart for Ashley.  She loses her job, she loses her apartment, she loses her mind.  On the other hand Jake is rising up fast.  The local bands demo tape falls into the right mans hands and Jake is instantly managing the band.  Then Jake meets Ashley (without the masks on) and the two form a friendship, neither knowing that the other is the one they kissed that fateful night (which is always ridiculous to me since it's not like those masks they wear in these movies really hides anything...I think Lindsay had on a cream colored veil).The film does pour on the `unlucky' bit a little too heavy in some scenes (NO ONE is that unfortunate) and the whole `passing of the unlucky survival backpack' was kind of (or really) lame, but for the most part `Just My Luck' hits its mark well.  Lindsay is charming and actually quite stunning here.  I don't think she's ever looked better.  Chris Pine is decent enough as Jake to make his whole transformation believable.  Missi Pyle always plays the same breed of train wreck, and she does it well so I can't knock her.  We're not looking for award winning performances, just entertaining ones, and that is precisely what we get here.Sure, `Just My Luck' is not a great comedy, but it is a good on and it proves to be Lohan's best film since `Mean Girls'.  She's proven she can carry a teen comedy like this, now it's time for her to branch out (much like her `Mean Girls' co-star McAdams) and prove that she can be taken seriously.That is if her mother will let her.",3,Just plain fun...,1218758400,"08 15, 2008",2008,2693,"['many', 'figured', 'film', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'disastrous', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'not', 'really', 'had', 'good', 'track', 'record', 'late', 'film', 'choices', 'last', 'time', 'made', 'something', 'was', ""n't"", 'wholly', 'cheesy', 'was', '2004', 'when', 'made', 'brilliant', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'even', 'then', 'was', 'co-star', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'who', 'stole', 'scene', 'then', 'Lindsay', 'kind', 'fallen', 'patterns', 'obscurity', 'making', 'one', 'bad', 'teen', 'flick', 'Now', 'Just', 'My', 'Luck', 'not', 'complete', 'departure', 'mold', 'not', 'smart', 'comedy', 'lose', 'lot', 'childish', 'overtones', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'moments.The', 'film', 'Ashley', 'Albright', 'successful', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'unbelievably', 'lucky', 'Everything', 'just', 'fall', 'line', 'making', 'life', 'walk', 'park', 'Jake', 'Hardin', 'polar', 'opposite', 'Nothing', 'out', 'right', 'inherently', 'unlucky', 'dead', 'end', 'job', 'bowling', 'alley', 'tries', 'fervently', 'get', 'one', 'local', 'bands', 'signed', 'record', 'label', 'avail.That', 'one', 'fateful', 'masquerade', 'ball', 'when', 'unexpected', 'kiss', 'Ashley', 'Jake', 'find', 'swapping', 'luck.Quickly', 'things', 'fall', 'apart', 'Ashley', 'job', 'apartment', 'mind', 'other', 'hand', 'Jake', 'rising', 'up', 'fast', 'local', 'bands', 'demo', 'tape', 'right', 'mans', 'hands', 'Jake', 'instantly', 'managing', 'band', 'Then', 'Jake', 'meets', 'Ashley', 'masks', 'two', 'form', 'friendship', 'knowing', 'other', 'one', 'kissed', 'fateful', 'night', 'always', 'ridiculous', 'not', 'masks', 'wear', 'movies', 'really', 'anything', 'think', 'Lindsay', 'had', 'cream', 'colored', 'veil', '.The', 'film', 'pour', 'unlucky', 'bit', 'little', 'too', 'heavy', 'scenes', 'ONE', 'unfortunate', 'whole', 'passing', 'unlucky', 'survival', 'backpack', 'was', 'kind', 'really', 'lame', 'most', 'part', 'Just', 'My', 'Luck', 'mark', 'well', 'Lindsay', 'charming', 'actually', 'quite', 'stunning', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'ever', 'looked', 'better', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'decent', 'enough', 'Jake', 'make', 'whole', 'transformation', 'believable', 'Missi', 'Pyle', 'always', 'same', 'breed', 'train', 'wreck', 'well', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'knock', ""'re"", 'not', 'looking', 'award', 'winning', 'performances', 'just', 'entertaining', 'ones', 'precisely', 'what', 'get', 'here.Sure', 'Just', 'My', 'Luck', 'not', 'great', 'comedy', 'good', 'be', 'Lohan', 'best', 'film', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'proven', 'can', 'carry', 'teen', 'comedy', 'now', 'time', 'branch', 'out', 'much', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'co-star', 'McAdams', 'prove', 'can', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously.That', 'mother', 'will', 'let']",N/A

When he does gain good luck, he just embraces it but uses it to try and make Lindsay's bad luck much better.

You should never coy with fortune telling, because the plot device will just conveniently turn your life around and hope you'll learn something from the nightmare.  First, you were a 50-year-old Laurie Strode, here you became unlucky, and now you went from a career rise to a career splat.""Just My Luck"" may not be as bad asher recent box-office disaster, but this is still ridiculously uncanny.  The movie thought God likes to tempt fate with certain people, and so Lindsay Lohan's character is livin' the Mary Tyler Moore life while Chris 'James T. Kirk' Pine happens to receive crap on a sliver platter every step of the way.  Then convenience circumstances at a party happened when these two unknowns kiss after a warning form the fortuneteller, and their luck has switched.  Then Lohan's character faced the 'wackiest' of unfortunate situations, like gettin' splashed on by the road, getting her hair caught in a dryer, having her home flooded, and reduced to working in janitorial work, while Pine gets a high-paid job by a record producer and has a secretary/call-girl the within a day.There's a difference between luck and stupidity, and the movie doesn't quite get it.  The character who had bad luck seems more irresponsible than unlucky, considering most of their actions caused them to be unfortunate.  Pine picked up a dollar bill from a trash can, not thinking it could be dirty, and Lohan tried to replace a tube lightbulb while holding another one while standing on a ladder, these characters simply didn't think things through and I'm suppose to believe this is bad luck; come to think of it, I'm surprised bad luck itself didn't kill them earlier on.  Nevermind the whole good luck aspect which is handled absurdly and coincidentally, one has to be brain-damage to think they weren't graced with internal fortune.Everything here is set up like a Disney Channel Original Movie. All the jokes were cartoony, the cast overexert themselves with endless chatter, and the story is farfetched. I can understand it wants to be over-the-top, but it's not really funny.  The characters are so annoying, Lohan kept verbally defending herself every time she gets into a jam and Pine plays like a one-dimensional meat package.  ""Just My Luck"" is romantic shlock, all bubbly and asinine catering to the young girls for sleepovers.  To think the best moments were the ones where Lohan's character is in prison and she got her face clocked (twice).

Yes, I am a HUGE LL fan. Prior to what others say, I think she is incredibly talented, even in corny movies such as this one. In all honestly, this definitely isn't one of Lindsays best movies, and if it had been someone else who starred in it, I'd no doubt be giving it one star. But Lindsay adds charm to this movie and makes it worth watching.Yes its corny at times, and yes its predictable (the basic gist: girl who has all the luck in the world meets boy who has all the bad luck in the world, they kiss, their fortunes get reversed, and of course develop romantic feelings for eachother...etc) and some parts are even downright ridiculous. But like I said, Lindsay makes it work, and she actually has really good chemistry with her co-star Chris Pines.but if your not a fan of Lohan whatsoever, and if you in no way enjoy any type of chick flick, then I'm willing to bet your not gonna enjoy this one, so I don't recommend that you watch this movie but if you are a Lohan fan and you do enjoy chick flicks, even slightly ridiculous ones, then I do recommend that you watch this.If anything, it'll atleast give you something entertaining to watch on a boring sunday afternoon!",4,what can I say...

1001309,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000GB775E,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 4]","This one is a fable. JUST MY LUCK is a sweet and funny love story about a mismatched pair, Ashley and Jake. Ashley (Lindsay Lohan) has always been touched by fabulous luck, while ill fate seems to persistently hang over Jake (Chris Pine). One fateful night, at a masquerade party while wearing masks, they kiss and, somehow, their respective lucks flip flop. Now, with the world suddenly crapping on her, Ashley must find Jake in the Manhattan jungle and reclaim her good fortune before she again gets fired, arrested, or electrocuted, among other things. But, as it turns out, maybe meeting Jake wasn't that unlucky of a thing...As I've said, this one's a fable. My advice for someone who hasn't yet seen JUST MY LUCK?  Just sit back and go with the premise. Outrageous luck and even karma are integral to the plot, but don't overanalyze all the wacky events. JUST MY LUCK is a breezy romantic comedy which modestly tries to please its audience. It also showcases the British pop rock band McFly, whose band members cheerfully play themselves.I enjoyed the acting here. Lindsay Lohan is again reliably engaging as, this time, she navigates the role of a glam girl turned very, very unfortunate soul. Lohan and Pine seem to match up well and show very good chemistry together; I found myself quite actively rooting for their happy ending. Chris Pine I had never seen in anything before, but he proves to be sweet and likable in his performance, with his klutzy side naturally engendering the most sympathy. Lohan continues to build on her promising career as, here, she displays equal measures of charm and pathos. She's very effective during her moments of bleakness, unveiling a touching vulnerability, which is never more endearing than when she at last calmly succumbs to a life of seemingly bad luck. I like the fact that she isn't afraid to look silly  as she has several scenes wherein she careens into mud, commits pratfalls, or stumbles about in a broken heel as her ruined mascara gives her that raccoon look. Honestly, Lindsay Lohan is right up there with the young, up-and-coming actresses who can legitimately act. No, sit down, Tara Reid.There are some funny gags in here as both the leads take their turns getting the bejesus kicked out of them by Lady Luck, including a gross out moment with Jake picking up some tainted cash from the trash. No, the storyline isn't as complicated in plot or as witty as some of Lohan's other works. What it has, though, is an undeniable sweetness and a certain good humored buoyancy which carries the viewer along until the happily ever after. This one rates three and a half lucky stars.",4,The fickle finger of fate...,1175472000,"04 2, 2007",2007,2638,"['one', 'fable', 'JUST', 'MY', 'LUCK', 'sweet', 'funny', 'love', 'story', 'mismatched', 'pair', 'Ashley', 'Jake', 'Ashley', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'always', 'been', 'touched', 'fabulous', 'luck', 'ill', 'fate', 'persistently', 'hang', 'Jake', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'One', 'fateful', 'night', 'masquerade', 'party', 'wearing', 'masks', 'kiss', 'somehow', 'respective', 'lucks', 'flip', 'flop', 'Now', 'world', 'suddenly', 'crapping', 'Ashley', 'must', 'find', 'Jake', 'Manhattan', 'jungle', 'reclaim', 'good', 'fortune', 'again', 'fired', 'arrested', 'electrocuted', 'other', 'things', 'out', 'maybe', 'meeting', 'Jake', 'was', ""n't"", 'unlucky', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'said', 'one', 'fable', 'advice', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'yet', 'seen', 'JUST', 'MY', 'LUCK', 'Just', 'sit', 'back', 'go', 'premise', 'Outrageous', 'luck', 'even', 'karma', 'are', 'integral', 'plot', 'do', ""n't"", 'overanalyze', 'wacky', 'events', 'JUST', 'MY', 'LUCK', 'breezy', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'modestly', 'please', 'audience', 'also', 'British', 'pop', 'rock', 'band', 'McFly', 'band', 'members', 'cheerfully', 'play', 'themselves.I', 'enjoyed', 'acting', 'here', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'again', 'reliably', 'engaging', 'time', 'role', 'glam', 'girl', 'turned', 'very', 'very', 'unfortunate', 'soul', 'Lohan', 'Pine', 'seem', 'match', 'up', 'well', 'show', 'very', 'good', 'chemistry', 'together', 'found', 'quite', 'actively', 'rooting', 'happy', 'ending', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'anything', 'be', 'sweet', 'likable', 'performance', 'klutzy', 'side', 'naturally', 'engendering', 'most', 'sympathy', 'Lohan', 'build', 'promising', 'career', 'here', 'equal', 'measures', 'charm', 'pathos', 'very', 'effective', 'moments', 'bleakness', 'unveiling', 'touching', 'vulnerability', 'never', 'more', 'endearing', 'when', 'last', 'calmly', 'succumbs', 'life', 'seemingly', 'bad', 'luck', 'fact', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'look', 'silly', 'several', 'scenes', 'mud', 'commits', 'pratfalls', 'stumbles', 'broken', 'heel', 'ruined', 'mascara', 'raccoon', 'look', 'Honestly', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'right', 'there', 'young', 'up-and-coming', 'actresses', 'who', 'can', 'legitimately', 'act', 'No', 'sit', 'down', 'Tara', 'Reid.There', 'are', 'funny', 'gags', 'here', 'leads', 'take', 'turns', 'getting', 'bejesus', 'kicked', 'Lady', 'Luck', 'including', 'gross', 'out', 'moment', 'Jake', 'picking', 'up', 'tainted', 'cash', 'trash', 'No', 'storyline', ""n't"", 'as', 'complicated', 'plot', 'as', 'witty', 'Lohan', 'other', 'works', 'What', 'though', 'undeniable', 'sweetness', 'certain', 'good', 'humored', 'buoyancy', 'viewer', 'happily', 'ever', 'one', 'rates', 'three', 'half', 'lucky', 'stars']",N/A

In one day, she finds five dollars on the street, gets a promotion and a new office, a date with a rich, cute guy, and accidentally picks up Sarah Jessica Parker's dry cleaning. Jake is the exact opposite.  He can't catch a break in any sense of the word. He's stuck in a dead-end job, the band he's trying to promote fires him, and he gets arrested often enough that he has a favorite police precinct.  When their situations are reversed, Ashley learns that she shouldn't have taken her lucky streak for granted and Jake learns what it means to get what he wants for once.At times this movie was cute, but it was pretty predictable. Samaire Armstrong who played Anna on The OC is the highlight of the film, in my opinion, as Ashley's best friend. The buddy interaction between the girls in the movie is much better than the love story.

She just misses a crowded elevator and winds up alone with a very cute guy.  And when she must substitute for her boss at a meeting, she gets a promotion out of the deal.Jake Hardin (Chris Pine), on the other hand, could use a few good luck charms.  He works at the Rock 'n Bowl, a bowling alley with live musical entertainment.  He's found a great new group in McFly (playing themselves), but can't get their CD to an executive no matter what he tries.Ashley has put together a masquerade ball as a promotion for record label Masquerade.  Jake tries to crash the party to get McFly's CD to the label's executive just one more time.  The two meet, and its love at first site.  When they kiss, however, everything changes.It starts with Ashley breaking the heel of her shoe.  Things go downhill from there, and she's soon unemployed and living with her two friends.  Jake, meanwhile, gets McFly signed to a record deal and finds himself living in a great, spacious apartment with a limo at his service.Ashley hates her new life, and tries everything she can think of to get her luck back.  Her path keeps crossing Jake's and the two begin to fall in love.  What will happen when Ashley learns the truth?Yeah, I'll admit it.  I'm a Lindsay Lohan fan.  That coupled with some very funny previews made me want to see this movie.  Unfortunately, it didn't live up to its potential.Obviously with a movie like this, the story is fairly predictable.  It falls on the humor and the actors to make the journey to the end well worth watching.  The actors do a great job with their material.  You can't help but root for Ashley and Jake to find some way to deal with whatever it is they are currently facing.  And, of course, you're rooting for them to get together.Unfortunately, the humor fell flat.  While I don't mind slapstick, I don't enjoy humor where the person is in pain or is constantly making a fool out of themselves.  The humor in this movie fell almost entirely into those categories.  Instead of laughing, I spend most of the movie cringing, waiting for the joke to come.The ending works well, however.  It was very sweet and redeems much of the earlier parts of the film.The musical group featured in the film, McFly, is a real band.

It's never gonna win any awards, like many of Lindsay's films. I think the main problem a lot of reviewers will have is the target audience. It's a very narrow target audience, appealing to the very young, and me. It doesn't help that the film is trying to ""break"" a UK band by featuring them in this. That band would be McFly and they are the bane of my life. They're awful. There was so much press about one of the (ugly) members, and Lindsay having a fling, but I highly doubt it.It's a simple, predictable storyline, stealing the same idea from Freaky Friday (which is superior), and taking the guy from Princess Diaries 2, Chris Pine, who I didn't remember, and don't think I'll be remembering him from this either.My real quibble (apart from McFly) is the cover of both the UK & US covers for the DVD.

1001341,A171FU7AC9YYMS,B000GB775E,"Steve Forsyth ""sforsythnoe""","[2, 2]","Poor Lindsay Lohan - it seems between bad choices in films and even worse choices in real life, she may be about to destroy her career before it even takes off.  As an actress, she is falling into some very rough waters where she is expected to carry films on her shoulders before she has even had a chance to mature in her craft.  As a child actress, she was a natural fit for her spate of Disney appearances, with FREAKY FRIDAY her crowning achievment.  However, as a young adult, the pressure is much higher, as is the bar of success.  And movies like this are NOT helping.But to be fair, one cannot place the blame on Ms. Lohan.  The fact is, she has already had a turn in a non-Disney role which paid off exquisitely.  MEAN GIRLS offered us the first glimpse of Lindsay in a post-Disney world.  The timing was on, the interaction with the cast was superb, and everything just fell into place.  But then again, that film also benefitted from a knockout script by a knockout writer (Tina Fey).  JUST MY LUCK has NONE of these things going for it.Perhaps ironically, Ms. Lohan's latest vehicle is quite an unlucky choice for her.  We have a promising premise in the concept of a boy and girl with opposing luck.  Lohan is lucky, Chris Pine is not.  Inevitably through the courses of movie magic, we know that the two will end up trading places (much like Eddie Murphy and Dan Akroyd once did in . . . what was the name of that movie again?)  The only mystery for the viewer is whether this will occur through a wise old Asian or a wise old Gypsy. (Spoiler - it's the gypsy! OK, I know, I shouldn't be giving these things away!)  Like I said, we all know this is going to happen.  What we DIDN'T know was that it was going to take THIRTY-FIVE minutes to get there!  So, we kill one full third of the movie being bombarded with example after example of Lohan's good luck and Pine's bad luck.  By the time they make the switch, I had already lost interest and was planning my lunch.After the predictable bout of sudden bad luck, Lohan learns that an ill-timed kiss with Mr. Pine was what caused the change of fortune.  Problem is, the kiss was at a masquerade party, and she doesn't know whom she kissed.  What follows is perhaps the film's only somewhat enjoyable sequence as Lohan tracks down and ambushes 20 strangers with sudden and embarassingly public kisses trying to get her luck back.Sadly, this brief bright spot ends too quickly, and it is back to the formula as Lohan and Pine meet and fall in love anyway, not knowing that they are the ones who caused each other's luck to change.  If predictable hook-ups make you happy, you might find some charm in this final third of the film - that is if you can overlook the sudden need for Lohan's best friend to become a song-writer in what was obviously a ""what do we do with the final act?"" tacked-on storyline with positively no set-up beforehand.The problem with this film is that it comes across as very ""slapped-together"" (To borrow from Mad TV, it was ""JUST MADE IN TEN DAYS).  Is the director to blame?  While Donald Petrie has a few hits to his name (MISS CONGENIALTY, GRUMPY OLD MEN, and MYSTIC PIZZA) he also has more than a few duds (THE ASSOCIATE, WELCOME TO MOOSEPORT, MY FAVORITE MARTIAN).Or perhaps it is the writing team?  To date, the two credited writers have yet to muster up a single true hit, and one gets the sense that a more competent writing team would have taken a better direction with the plot and have not wasted the obvious talent that Ms. Lohan does in fact possess.  Personally, I would have liked to have seen the producers take a risk and make Lohan a much more loathsome character to begin with than she is.  Her character comes off as too nice to hate, and yet too shallow to root for.Whoever is to blame, this is clearly a sub-par effort at best, and one I hope Lindsay (or her casting agent) will learn from.  With four movies coming down the pike, she still has a shot at transitioning into a much more serious career.

She lives in a luxurious apartment and wears designer clothes on her paltry salary (her two friends in the same job share a much dinkier apartment and have much less money, apparently). Anyway, she gets promoted and everything always goes her way even though she doesn't have much common sense. Jake, on the other hand, is a loser, also without much common sense. Jake sneaks into a party that Ashley is in charge of where everyone is wearing a mask (except Ashley - she wears some netty thing).  They dance and kiss. Their ""luck"" is switched. (What happened to all the other guys she kissed? Hey, maybe she stole one of those guys' luck!) Ashley goes to jail and gets punched out. She gets fired.  Her apt is flooded. She moves in with her friends and drops her contact lens in the litter box. She immediately puts it back in her eye. When her friends express concern, she says ""Hey, it's my last one!"" She must be out of contact lens solution also!! She gets an eye infection which lasts one day. Ashley also displays her vast stupidity when her blowdryer shorts out: she throws it in the tub and runs water on it.Meanwhile, everything's going Jake's way and he no longer even needs to wear eyeglasses anymore (when they switch luck again he goes back to wearing them). The band he's managing gets a record  contract.  He gets a gorgeous apartment and a limo.Ashley's friends assist her in trying to find the mysterious kisser who stole her luck.

1001343,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000GB775E,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 2]","Lindsay Lohan plays Ashley, luckiest career girl. She can do anything successfully with her good luck, but one day she accidentally trades her fortune with Jake (Chris Pine) the unluckiest guy in the city. Jake, wannabe rock band manager (for McFly as themselves) is given a big chance while Ashley loses everything. The story of `Just My Luck' is so simple and silly, and like `Freaky Friday' you don't have to take it seriously.Now let's forget about the gossips and tabloids for a while, and look at the film's premise itself. Here's a working girl who can achieve anything, and anything here includes her own office. She then loses this supernatural power and tries to retrieve it with the silliest antics I ever saw these days. Yes, I know, as I wrote before, I should take the film as it is, a romantic comedy made for fun, but while watching it I was thinking about one thing.What does Ashley really want to do? We are not sure from the beginning to the end. Ashley's two female friends or bossy supervisor are not definitely her goal. We find it hard to identify with anyone in the film and with Lindsay Lohan's limited acting range the film relies on easy sight gags that look out of place in this romantic comedy.It is a pity because Chris Pine is surprisingly good and there is certainly considerable chemistry between the two leads. However, the film's contrived script goes too far when it shows a successful career girl in Sarah Jessica Parker's dress kissing a total stranger with a Zorro-like mask. I don't know the target audiences of the film (and I am not one of them, I know), but if you are among them, you would not confuse luck with stupidity.One good thing about `Just My Luck' is its rock band McFly. The film is not bad as critics are saying, but it is still not good and the most regrettable thing is my favorite Missi Pyle is wasted again.",3,(2.5 STARS) Not Terrieble as Critics Say But Still a Disappointing Rom-Com from Lindsay Lohan,1168473600,"01 11, 2007",2007,1867,"['Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'Ashley', 'luckiest', 'career', 'girl', 'can', 'do', 'anything', 'successfully', 'good', 'luck', 'one', 'day', 'accidentally', 'fortune', 'Jake', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'unluckiest', 'guy', 'city', 'Jake', 'wannabe', 'rock', 'band', 'manager', 'McFly', 'given', 'big', 'chance', 'Ashley', 'everything', 'story', 'Just', 'My', 'Luck', 'so', 'simple', 'silly', 'Freaky', 'Friday', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'take', 'seriously.Now', 'let', 'forget', 'gossips', 'tabloids', 'while', 'look', 'film', 'premise', 'Here', 'working', 'girl', 'who', 'can', 'achieve', 'anything', 'anything', 'here', 'own', 'office', 'then', 'supernatural', 'power', 'tries', 'retrieve', 'silliest', 'antics', 'ever', 'saw', 'days', 'Yes', 'know', 'wrote', 'should', 'take', 'film', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'made', 'fun', 'watching', 'was', 'thinking', 'one', 'Ashley', 'really', 'want', 'do', 'are', 'not', 'sure', 'beginning', 'end', 'Ashley', 'two', 'female', 'friends', 'bossy', 'supervisor', 'are', 'not', 'definitely', 'goal', 'find', 'hard', 'identify', 'anyone', 'film', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'limited', 'acting', 'range', 'film', 'relies', 'easy', 'sight', 'gags', 'look', 'place', 'romantic', 'comedy.It', 'pity', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'certainly', 'considerable', 'chemistry', 'two', 'leads', 'However', 'film', 'contrived', 'script', 'too', 'far', 'when', 'successful', 'career', 'girl', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'dress', 'kissing', 'total', 'stranger', 'Zorro-like', 'mask', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'target', 'audiences', 'film', 'am', 'not', 'one', 'know', 'are', 'would', 'not', 'confuse', 'luck', 'stupidity.One', 'good', 'thing', 'Just', 'My', 'Luck', 'rock', 'band', 'McFly', 'film', 'not', 'bad', 'critics', 'are', 'saying', 'still', 'not', 'good', 'most', 'regrettable', 'thing', 'favorite', 'Missi', 'Pyle', 'wasted', 'again']",N/A
