764702,A1H0CWFQY2HFGG,B0000AM6IV,"Bud Bundy ""B movie lover""","[13, 20]","I remembered seeing this on Mystery Science Theater 3000 a long time ago, so I thought it might be interesting to get the original movie and see how it stands up.It doesn't.We start with Kathy hanging out on Malibu Beach (wearing a big oversized T-shirt), getting dumped by her boyfriend.  Then she gets a letter informing her that her father (who she hasn't seen in 10 years) has been killed.  He was an archaeologist working in Africa.  He had a theory that Atlantis was a giant spaceship that sunk to the center of the Earth after a volcanic eruption.  So, Kathy goes to Africa and ends up falling down the same bottomless pit her father fell into.  (It's about 30 feet deep, all the way to the center of the Earth!).  Anyhow, she finds Atlantis and the government puts a price on her head - they don't like ""aliens"" from the surface.  So various people chase her around while a couple of guys she meets defend her.Overall, this movie is just silly and boring.  Imagine ""Space Hunter:  Adventures in the Forbidden Zone"", except instead of being done for a teen audience it's done for an audience of nine year old kids.  You can't take any of the action the least bit seriously because it's all done in such a silly way.  Really, this would make a great double-bill with ""The Goonies"".  What the heck is the point in hiring a supermodel to star in a film for little kids?Overall, very disappointing.  If you wanna see Kathy, but one of her exercise videos instead.  They're much sexier than this silly thing.",2,Boring,1147478400,"05 13, 2006",2006,1510,"['remembered', 'seeing', 'Mystery', 'Science', 'Theater', '3000', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'thought', 'might', 'be', 'interesting', 'get', 'original', 'movie', 'see', 'how', 'up.It', ""doesn't.We"", 'start', 'Kathy', 'hanging', 'out', 'Malibu', 'Beach', 'wearing', 'big', 'oversized', 'T-shirt', 'getting', 'dumped', 'boyfriend', 'Then', 'letter', 'informing', 'father', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', '10', 'years', 'been', 'killed', 'was', 'archaeologist', 'working', 'Africa', 'had', 'theory', 'Atlantis', 'was', 'giant', 'spaceship', 'center', 'Earth', 'volcanic', 'eruption', 'So', 'Kathy', 'Africa', 'up', 'falling', 'down', 'same', 'bottomless', 'father', 'fell', '30', 'feet', 'deep', 'way', 'center', 'Earth', 'Anyhow', 'Atlantis', 'government', 'price', 'head', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'aliens', 'surface', 'So', 'various', 'people', 'chase', 'couple', 'guys', 'defend', 'her.Overall', 'movie', 'just', 'silly', 'boring', 'Imagine', 'Space', 'Hunter', 'Adventures', 'Forbidden', 'Zone', 'instead', 'being', 'done', 'teen', 'audience', 'done', 'audience', 'nine', 'year', 'old', 'kids', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'action', 'least', 'bit', 'seriously', 'done', 'such', 'silly', 'way', 'Really', 'would', 'make', 'great', 'double-bill', 'Goonies', 'What', 'heck', 'point', 'hiring', 'supermodel', 'star', 'film', 'little', 'kids', 'Overall', 'very', 'disappointing', 'wan', 'see', 'Kathy', 'one', 'exercise', 'videos', 'instead', ""'re"", 'much', 'sexier', 'silly', 'thing']",Alien From L.A.

764705,AQJIDIX0B3VVB,B0000AM6IV,"K. Cannon ""katatonia2""","[5, 9]","I really like Alien From L.A. Maybe It's because I like Kathy Ireland's sweet little voice? They used to show this often on HBO/Cinemax &amp; Showtime in the early 1990's. It was a fun way to waste 90 minutes on a summer afternoon.Sure, Alien From L.A. is a complete fantasy and way over the top but it has a certain charm to it that I really love. It often has that Roger Corman B-Movie &quot;cult atmosphere&quot; going for it. Personally I wouldn't change a thing about this movie. It is so much better than similar types of films released in the last few years.Most people probably don't like this film because it seems so unrealistic and cheesy. I think that it was really meant to be satirical comedy, and only a limited percentage of viewers will actually &quot;get&quot; it. You don't have to really believe the things happening in the story could really happen...after all, it is only a fantasy movie!As for the new DVD from MGM...They've done yet another admirable job on this release. It is in full-screen format, but that may possibly be it's original format. This is actually the way many movies are shot, some are later &quot;matted&quot; for theaters. The Picture quality and Dolby 2.0 Surround track are just about as good as could be hoped for on the DVD format. It is vastly superior to the old VHS video I used to have of Alien From L.A.

(I'm not the only one who's built one of these right?) In this film, Kathy plays Wanda Saknussum, squeaky voiced, beglassed, teenager and whiner who works part time slingin' hash. Her boyfriend dumps her because she's ""no fun."" No, no, he means she never wants to go anywhere with him. This guy travels the world once every weekend so it's apparent why this would annoy him that much.She makes a last ditch effort to win him back by sqeaking, ""What don't you like about me? Just tell me and I'll change!"" You have to be an ignorant beach bum not to take her up on this offer...he is. Meanwhile back at the dive, Wanda gets word that her daddy's dead. Get this, the letter literally says he ""fell down a bottomless pit!"" Her mom's already dead so she's all alone in the world. She really doesn't seem that upset though! She just mopes around and whines a tiny bit more than usual. As MST3K puts it her reaction is ""dull surprise.""Facing her fears Wanda sets out to Krapastan or wherever her dad was exploring. She goes to the ruins where he disappeared and she falls down the bottomless pit as well. She survives this fall with little internal bleeding and permanent bone and organ damage. Underground she stumbles upon a civilization...Atlantis. The production value drops a couple budget ratings as well. The costumes and make up look worse than your local community theater could dig up.Here she meets her first partner in crime, Gus(typical Atlantian name), who reluctantly brings her along in exchange for saving his life. Kathy's glasses break along the way, in the first step in hotting her up. Anyway, yadda yadda yadda, tons of bad makeup and clothes, Kathy looks hot, a gangster midget with foot-long eye lashes, Kathy looks even more hot, and a Prince Charming character called, appropriately enough, Charmin.Oh yeah, they keep saying Kathy has ""Big bones"" for some reason. Maybe she was supposed to be taller than them or something, I don't know. There were a couple large portions of her anatomy, but they were certainly not bones.Does Kathy make it back home? Does she find her father? Does she down a can of WD40 to get rid of that squeak?
