She tells them that her car broke down about a mile back. They drive her to the vehicle and... the fun begins. The four wake up in an old house along w/ another group of five people. No one knows exactly why they're there, not even after watching a video left by whomever set this up. All it tells them is that in order to get out, they will have to suffer pain. Monitors have been surgically implanted in the backs of their heads that measure the chemicals released through pain. Obviously, this leads to drastic action, and loads of bloody violence. VILE is sort of a low-grade SAW clone w/ a different motive behind the torture, and without SAW's nifty torture devices. While the acting is above average, few of the characters are likeable enough to cheer for. Their survival just isn't all that important. It's also pretty weird how quickly some of these supposedly normal, everyday folks adapt to being body-mutilators!  The most amazing thing is just how boring this movie gets in spots! You would think that it would have to be terrifying and disturbing. Instead, much of the brutality is mundane- a hot iron, boiling water, a screwdriver, etc., and the dialogue is less than intriguing.

A fingernail or two torn off with pliers. Torture-porn horror subgenre fans take note ~ this little shocker will hit the spot. The torture is literally part of the point of the film. 'Vile' is a gruesome direct-to-video piece about a group of people kidnapped and trapped at a location (don't you love that?) and forced to inflict severe pain on each other in order to fill up the vials (get it?) attached to the back of their heads with the various fluids the brain produces when in excruciating pain. The purpose, we find out, is for a powerful new drug. Only when they fill the amount with what's needed will they be allowed to leave. The thing I like most about this movie are the characters. The chemistry between our protagonists is excellent and they're vastly more likable to even the SAW movies. So many of these stories start with people just waking up out of nowhere, but these people meet on a camping trip before the pain begins. Yes there's an actual backstory! The director, Taylor Sheridan, does exceptionally well and the score isn't bad. Hey it was tedious at times I'll admit but at the end I was F'n impressed!

Vile, Sheridan's first appearance behind the camera, is a pointless, plotless, ridiculous piece of torture porn that's supposed to get its originality from, shall we say, the method of delivery (which may be considered a spoiler, but what the hell, we'll go there). I can't say for certain it's been done before, but while I was watching it, and ever since, I had the distinct impression I'd seen it somewhere else. I've put off writing this review far too long attempting to come up with it and haven't, unfortunately, but once I realized I was wasting far too much time trying to figure it out, I ditched the attempt and sat down to write this.Plot: bunch of young folks locked in house by crazy person (Weekend's Maria Olsen, fast becoming one of the most recognizable faces in Z-grade horror). They have to cause each other extreme pain in order to free themselves. Yeah, that's about it, though there's an entirely predictable plot twist about 90% of the way through the movie that you'll never, not in a million nanoseconds, see coming.Actual reasons you may want to watch this movie:1 You're a fan of one of the cast members (Olsen, Kyle XY's April Matson, Shutter's Maya Hazen, and The Dark Knight Rises' Ian Bohen are the movie's most recognizable faces; Tool vocalist Maynard James Keenan also turns up in a brief cameo).2 You're on a quest to see every torture porn movie ever made. You, my friend, are a masochist, and I feel for you.3 You still believe that Taylor Sheridan can do no wrong.I can't help you with the first two, but if you're watching it for reason #3, be prepared for a major letdown.

The best way to describe it in reference to other movies is it's a cross between Saw II and Wrong Turn.  The acting is very well done and the character development is also moderately deep.The ""culprit"" was certainly a surprise at the end, although thinking back on it I guess it shouldn't have been.  There will be many who will say that this is a direct rip off of Saw and you would probably be right.  But if you enjoyed the Saw movies before they started to get old and predictable I think you'll enjoy this movie.  At an hour and a half it's not too long.  It does start out slow for those of you that like to get right into the gore but once it finds its ""groove"" the movie progresses quite nicely.One last point:  As to the gore, the writers didn't just throw in gratuitous shots of it just because they could.  This movie has equal parts character development and gore and it strikes a nice balance between them.",5,A slightly new take on Saw.,1351987200,"11 4, 2012",2012,1039,"['have', 'say', 'seeing', 'Saw', 'movies', 'being', 'bored', 'last', 'movie', 'one', 'kept', 'interest', 'best', 'way', 'describe', 'reference', 'other', 'movies', 'cross', 'Saw', 'II', 'Wrong', 'Turn', 'acting', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'character', 'development', 'also', 'moderately', 'deep.The', 'culprit', 'was', 'certainly', 'surprise', 'end', 'thinking', 'back', 'guess', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'will', 'be', 'many', 'who', 'will', 'say', 'direct', 'rip', 'Saw', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'right', 'enjoyed', 'Saw', 'movies', 'started', 'get', 'old', 'predictable', 'think', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'movie', 'hour', 'half', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'start', 'out', 'slow', 'like', 'get', 'right', 'gore', 'groove', 'movie', 'quite', 'nicely.One', 'last', 'point', 'gore', 'writers', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'throw', 'gratuitous', 'shots', 'just', 'could', 'movie', 'equal', 'parts', 'character', 'development', 'gore', 'nice', 'balance']",N/A

The next thing you know they are trapped inside a house with other people. Their brains are connected to a collection system which measures and deposits chemicals produced when the body is in pain. The captives have 22 hours (86 minutes movie time) to produce the desired amount of this chemical or else! They can feel free to use any of the torture devices provided.There are two things you can do, should you want to play the game.A) Figure out which ways effectively get the desired chemical by causing pain, but minimizing the damage to the body, such as pulling a tooth and irritating the nerve ending underneath or...B) Draw lots and randomly torture each other in different ways.Plan B makes for a better film. The film was mindless and senseless, not like the original &#34;Saw.&#34; Unless you just want to watch people hitting and cutting each, you might want to take a pass. Oh yes, expected twist blah blah blah. The opening soundtrack/scene was the best aspect of the film.Parental Guide: F-bombs.

That being said, I'm really impressed. The acting is quite good as is the dialogue. Watching how different personalities handle the situation is quite fascinating and, the music...wow. Most semi-low budget horror movies go for a death metal sound but, this one is more in the realm of folk music. The twist may have you contemplating psycology a bit at least, I certainly was.
