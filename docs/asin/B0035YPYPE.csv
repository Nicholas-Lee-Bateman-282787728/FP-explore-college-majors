So, don't expect much slap-stick or gag humour from him.  I understand that comedic tastes varies for everyone, and since he is a situational humour comedian, it's either you will relate to him or not.",5,I liked it,1384732800,"11 18, 2013",2013,315,"['Danny', 'Bhoy', 'one', 'favourite', 'comedians', 'great', 'storyteller', 'comedy', 'style', 'sharp', 'witty', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'slap-stick', 'gag', 'humour', 'understand', 'comedic', 'tastes', 'varies', 'everyone', 'situational', 'humour', 'comedian', 'will', 'relate', 'not']",Danny Bhoy: Subject to Change

I'm not saying he doesn't swear occasionally - he does - but he doesn't base his entire flipping act on it.Having grown up in Scotland, bits of this tickled me a little deeper - like the Scots response to being told it's last call in a pub (I've seen it with my own eyes - lol!), or the fact that the Scottish National Anthem is the only one in the world that makes provision for those with Tourette's - ;-)His really-bad French and American accents are hilarious, and I have to say I love it when a comic cracks HIMSELF up!There are two bonus features on this DVD as well - a guide to American sports, and a visitors guide to Scotland - both as funny as anything in the stand-up routine.

Much of the DVD is the same as the Australian performances from the Sydney Opera House and Atheaneum.  In fact, I think those performances are superior to this one, but nevertheless, this is a great DVD.  I only discovered Mr. Bhoy recently and am genuinely impressed.  He is an amazing performer.  His ability to go off on tangents and then to segway back into the original topic is impressive.  He should have a huge fan base in the US.",4,Very Funny Bhoy,1278115200,"07 3, 2010",2010,479,"['have', 'agree', 'fella', 'NZ', 'Much', 'DVD', 'same', 'Australian', 'performances', 'Sydney', 'Opera', 'House', 'Atheaneum', 'fact', 'think', 'performances', 'are', 'superior', 'one', 'nevertheless', 'great', 'DVD', 'only', 'discovered', 'Mr.', 'Bhoy', 'recently', 'am', 'genuinely', 'impressed', 'amazing', 'performer', 'ability', 'go', 'off', 'tangents', 'then', 'segway', 'back', 'original', 'topic', 'impressive', 'should', 'have', 'huge', 'fan', 'base', 'US']",Danny Bhoy: Subject to Change
