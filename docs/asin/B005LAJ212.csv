I didn't expect that but she has shown me she can act both sides of that situation.Victoria as a charactor is somewhat murkier in that she says she loves  a man and actively connives against him. I find her behavior weaker than Emily/Amanda but c'est la guerre.***SPOILERS****I believe it is possible that no one died on that plane. We shall see but it sounds like the kind of mis-direct a Revenge story is famous for doing.Daniel & Ashley are going to hook up and shatter apart at least once.I hope Declan stands strong against the emotional blackmail from Charlotte but he may break down as he is very young and a decent sort himself.Jack & Amanda/Emily are going to blowup at or around the time of birth if she doesn't miscarry but she is so unstable that there is just no way she will be carrying Jack's kid, IMO.Amerikon Initiative is going to be watching Nolan and we know how that is going to turn out...***End of SPOILERS***All In all, I will watch season 2 and hope tha it continues to walk the line and not sucumb to soap opera melodrama.",4,Predictions for Season 2 ***SPOILERS****,1337817600,"05 24, 2012",2012,1421,"['show', 'walked', 'fine', 'line', 'melodrama', 'real', 'emotions', 'beginning.Emily', 'Van', 'Camp', 'shown', 'very', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', '/', 'Bat-Man', 'portrayal', 'Socialite', 'damaged', 'past', 'as', 'well', 'Operative', 'who', 'contingency', 'plan', 'moves', 'Deep', 'Strike', 'maintaing', 'adaptability', 'accept', 'reversals', 'use', 'further', 'own', 'ends', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'shown', 'can', 'act', 'sides', 'situation.Victoria', 'charactor', 'somewhat', 'murkier', 'man', 'actively', 'connives', 'find', 'behavior', 'weaker', 'Emily/Amanda', ""c'est"", 'la', 'guerre', 'believe', 'possible', 'one', 'died', 'plane', 'shall', 'see', 'kind', 'mis-direct', 'Revenge', 'story', 'famous', 'doing.Daniel', 'Ashley', 'are', 'going', 'hook', 'up', 'shatter', 'apart', 'least', 'once.I', 'hope', 'Declan', 'strong', 'emotional', 'blackmail', 'Charlotte', 'may', 'break', 'down', 'very', 'young', 'decent', 'sort', 'himself.Jack', 'Amanda/Emily', 'are', 'going', 'blowup', 'time', 'birth', ""n't"", 'miscarry', 'so', 'unstable', 'just', 'way', 'will', 'be', 'carrying', 'Jack', 'kid', 'IMO.Amerikon', 'Initiative', 'going', 'be', 'watching', 'Nolan', 'know', 'how', 'going', 'turn', 'out', '***End', 'SPOILERS***All', 'will', 'watch', 'season', '2', 'hope', 'tha', 'walk', 'line', 'not', 'sucumb', 'soap', 'opera', 'melodrama']",Revenge: Season 1
1492797,ADENUJJYKNHPO,B005LAJ212,Andrew Salmon,"[0, 0]","So much of TV these days is just pretty people in peril, which is why something original like Revenge was so refreshing. Sure, it had the pretty people. Sure, they were in peril. But they weren't in danger of wearing skirts that actually covered their private parts or shoes they could really walk in or who was sleeping with who. No, the pretty people were in danger from a murderous vengeful woman who was going to utterly destroy each and every one of the people who disgraced and murdered her father.Now that's a premise worth a look. Throw in a great cast and wonderful production values and, wow, a show actual worth watching. A miracle!For the first 18 episodes anyway.Then Revenge became what it was trying most not to be: a true soap opera. Who is sleeping with whom? Who is a scuzzy businessman? Who suffers under the family curse? Will Amanda/Emily find true love with Jack?Yawn.To these soap opera elements were added ideas pulled stale from the human nether regions of the writers as a second season loomed and Emily/Amanda was supposed to HAVE her revenge by the end of Season One. Instead the story got muddied up, soap opera tropes reared their ugly heads and Revenge became Dallas 2.0.My wife and I sat though the first season. We will not be watching Season Two. If the show lasts long enough to get back to what it is supposed to be about, we might return for the finale. Otherwise, we're moving on. Bottom line here is that if you're new to the show and are chomping at the bit to see the premise pay off, you will be disappointed. If, on the other hand, you like seeing pretty people in peril from every cliche in the book, then Revenge has what you're looking for.",2,"Suffers From ""UH-OH We've been renewed for Season Two!

All 22 episodes are here for those who missed the show in its initial run. However, make sure you don't start watching it before blocking off a solid 16 hours to get through it all. You won't be able to tear your eyes off the screen once it starts.Emily Thorne (Emily VanCamp) returns to the Hamptons after spending several years in juvenile detention. As soon as she arrives, Emily sets out on a mission to exact sweet revenge on those who tore her family apart. She'll stop at nothing to expose the people who framed her father for a crime he didn't commit. Her biggest target is the powerfully rich queen of the Hamptons, Victoria Grayson (Madeleine Stowe) and her husband (Henry Czerny).""Revenge"" is one of those shows you watch and when it's over groan and wish it could be two longer. I can never get enough of it. Just when you think you have something figured out writers go and change all the rules of the game again.The best way to describe the show is as ""The Punisher"" meets ""La Femme Nikita."" Emily Thorne isn't a government agent, but she's just as resourceful and ingenious. After the first episode, you find yourself wiping the sweat off your forehead in relief that you'll never have a chance to cross her. She wants retribution for the death of her father. Anyone who was involved is going to suffer horribly.Each of the five discs contains bonus material. They include commentary for the pilot episode by creator Mike Kelley and actor Emily VanCamp, featurettes such as ""Nolan Ross Exposed,"" ""Roadmap to 'Revenge,'"" ""At Home in the Hamptons,"" and ""Haute Hamptons: Femme Fatale Fashion."" There are also bloopers and many deleted scenes. Music videos for Christina Perri's ""Distance"" and Angus and Julia Stone's ""For You"" are featured as well.""Revenge: The Complete First Season"" is only available in a regular DVD format now. I'm not entirely sure why ABC Studios went this way with ""Revenge"" but put out ""Once Upon a Time"" in both Blu-ray and DVD.

It and the program Ringer both debuted in 2011 and both portrayed women pretending to be someone they were not.  Where Ringer was more about fitting in and ultimately solving a mystery, Revenge focused on that all consuming dish ""best served cold!""  Each week another name was crossed off the ""list"" as Ms. Thorne continued down the ultimate path of vindication and validation.Some of the episodes are un-even, however (and I fully expect to incur wrath), what I simply don't get is how Emily Thorne (Emily VanCamp) manages to so quickly reel in the male leads in the land of the ""pretty people""?  Personally, I find Emily more handsome than pretty.  Especially, when she is in like the same zip code as say Ashley Madekwe (AKA Ashley Davenport) and even her alter ego Amanda Clark (AKA Margarita Levieva).  IMO, Gabriel Mann (as Nolan Ross) dominates as the geeky, social inept Bill Gates type character.Revenge is an interesting show with not much competition in the genre.

I put off watching it as I didn't really think I'd like it.  But, after having watched most of the other series DVD's, like ""Once.........."" and Castle, and The Shield, etc., I finally decided to pop it into the player one night.What can I say?  When I'm wrong, I'm wrong!  This show grabbed me right from the very start!  And not just me, but my picky teenaged son!  It's one of the few shows that he watches without doing something else, like playing a video game or listening to a CD.The characters are simply fantastic.  Our favorite good guys are, of course, Emily, Nolan, Jack, and Declan whose character had some incredible growth over the course of the season.  There are so many bad guys, it's hard to list them out.  And there are so many sides to these people that you find yourself hating them one time and feeling for them the next.The plots are so unpredictable that you just don't see things coming, yet they never get into the ""get real!"" category.  They always make sense.My biggest complaint in the series is the way Victoria was dressed and styled.  It seemed to me that she wore the same style all too often.  You'd think with her money, her taste would be better.  She also needs to do something with her hair.  It's usually worn straight and boring, but when it was sometimes put up, it was unbecoming.  They could do something with her make-up, too.  It makes her look old and therefore some of the romance scenes, especially the ones done in the past, are kind of unbelieveable.SPOILER ALERT!!  In the last episode I really thought Emily and Jack were going to finally get together, and was heartbroken when Amanda showed back up.  And showed up pregnant!  I thought the Asian guy said he'd taken care of her!  I thought she was gone.  But noooooooooooooooooo!!Anyway, I have to say it was a superb show and I will be ordering Season 2 today.

1492855,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B005LAJ212,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[134, 148]","After the almost instant success of ""Modern Family,"" ABC has struggled for a couple of seasons to find a suitable companion that could hold onto the ratings of its Wednesday night comedy line-up.  In 2011, they struck gold in the most unlikely of places and made ""Revenge"" into one of the year's biggest new hits.  Pulpy and over-the-top, this soap opera is structured as a neo-noir mystery set in the upscale environs of an elite Hamptons community.  It owes a lot to the classic tales of excess that populated the airwaves in the eighties (Dallas, Dynasty, and the like) but updates traditional conventions in a fun and modern way.  And ""Revenge,"" while not exactly perfect, is just that--FUN.  It is the TV equivalent of a good page-turning beach read, an unapologetic potboiler designed to provide escapism and adventure.  With an attractive cast, gorgeous locales, stunning costumes and lush melodrama--the show proves the old adage that money can't buy happiness.  But in this case, it just might buy revenge!The first season has been structured around a complicated plot that ties a long distant crime to a young, seemingly amiable socialite (Emily Van Camp).  Seeking to avenge her father's unjust persecution in the aforementioned atrocity, Van Camp arrives in town with unlimited wealth, surprising cunning, and a big score to settle.  One of her primary targets is the local nobility, the Grayson clan.  As the episodes progress, we see Van Camp ingratiate herself with the family, get involved with the heir apparent, and start to wreak havoc to those who participated in her father's downfall.  As the backstory unfolds through flashbacks, we start to understand how the deeds of the past have irrevocably affected the Van Camp character and why her pursuit is so single-minded.The Good:Primary Cast:  Emily Van Camp makes an intriguing heroine.  She is so inherently likable that it makes her acts of treachery all the more powerful and surprising.  Madeleine Stowe, as the Grayson matriarch, is a pleasantly understated villain (blending the realness of Knot's Landing's Abby with the excess of Dynasty's Alexis).  These are two great characters.  I also love Gabriel Mann (hysterical as Van Camp's closest ally), Joshua Bowman (as the love interest/potential pawn), and Henry Czerny (underrated as the head of the Grayson clan).  In addition, the show boasts a number of fun guest roles from William Devane to Ashton Holmes to Amber Valletta.The Indifferent:Peripheral Cast:  Several supporting players struggle for real identity or integration into the primary action.  As a former flame and local barkeep, Nick Wechsler (though likable) oftentimes seems like an afterthought who hangs out with whichever character will give him the most screen time.  Ditto for Stowe's assistant played by Ashley Madekwe who seems not to have found a solid place in the big picture (when she becomes the media representative for the family in a high profile situation, it is particularly preposterous).Story Structure:  ""Revenge"" starts (at the beginning of the season) with the notion that one character will get his/her comeuppance in each episode.  Though fun, this premise wears thin fairly quickly.  Fortunately, the writers soon addressed this element and focused more on the on-going story threads which make the show so juicy.  So very quickly, a show with promise turns into one that is quite good.The Not-So-Good:Young Love:  In grand soap tradition, ""Revenge"" wants to offer up a modern Romeo and Juliet tale by having the Grayson daughter (Christa B. Allen) get involved with a poor local boy (Wechler's brother played by Connor Paolo).  I'm sorry, but when these two take center stage (Paolo is especially irritating), the show all but grinds to a halt.  Maybe it is just because everything else is so good, this weak coupling sticks out like a sore thumb.In summary, if you have been missing your nighttime soap operas, ""Revenge"" should easily fill that void.  It's a well made show with one of the year's strongest ensemble casts.  It doesn't aim for grittiness or realism, but excess and escapism.  With the first season structured so specifically, though, one wonders how the creators will keep moving the plot lines forward as the central mystery comes to a close.  What happens when ""Revenge"" has been enacted?  We'll have to wait and see, but I'm certainly along for the ride.

""It's a great place for a fantasy background,"" VanCamp says in the making-of extra, ""Roadmap to Revenge.""In the same feature, creator Mike Kelley tells us, ""Revenge is the mother of all story engines for me ... a loss of love and family - that betrayal - are such strong motivators for any protagonist.""Co-executive producer/writer Mark B. Perry and Kelley advise the classic revenge tale by Alexander Dumas, ""The Count of Monte Cristo,"" went into the pitch for ""Revenge."" ""I was a huge fan of the book and I felt like this was a real opportunity to bring the nighttime soap opera back,"" Kelley says.Executive producer Marty Bowen chimes in saying, ""For me, at its core, it's more opera than soap opera.""OK, but the only time ""Revenge"" drags is when the story spins off in a tangent of love and family angst. When it sticks to Emily and her mission, this thriller is like a page turner that keeps us up into the wee hours. I couldn't stop watching this mash of murder, betrayal, blackmail and potent justice. Maybe Emily should wear a mask and a cape, but, when not styling like a 21st Century Grace Kelly, she's deliciously menacing in a black hoodie, jeans and boots.In the extra, ""Haute Hamptons: Femme Fatale Fashions,"" VanCamp tells us that Emily's socialite persona is modeled after iconic movie star Grace Kelly. Costume designer Jill Ohanneson (""Dexter,"" ""Six Feet Under,"" ""Lie to Me"") says she spoke to VanCamp and Stowe about their feelings and their models for clothing inspiration. Audrey Hepburn, Katharine Hepburn and Grace Kelly certainly work for VanCamp. Stowe's look is ""a little bit dangerous and very sensual, but still elegant and a little bit aggressive,"" Ohanneson says.""I really didn't want this character to be the typical society matron. I wanted her to have a more feline sense of her character, and Jill really went with that,"" Stowe confirms.The cast is not so serious it can't make fun of their trappings, however. In the bloopers extra, Czerny, the deadly businessman, cries out in a scene, ""Help - Help! My daughter is wearing some pink thing and the bedding is mauve! Mauve, can't you see it?""Nice when the bloopers actually make you laugh. Additional extras on this 22 episode, five disc set from ABC Studios include deleted scenes on each disc, two music videos, an interview with Emily's frequently reluctant ally played by Gabriel Mann (""The Bourne Identity,"" ""The Bourne Supremacy""), ""Nolan Ross Exposed."" ""At Home in the Hamptons,"" is where we learn Wilmington, N.C., substituted for The Hamptons in the pilot episode. Sets constructed afterward feature replicas of a grand estate, a seaside cottage (to die for!) and a neighborhood bar, renamed Porter's Stowaway Tavern for the series. ""At Home"" also shows how the use of green screen brings these sets to life with breathtaking seasonal views.Critics and viewers loved the first season of ""Revenge""; it was a certifiable hit for ABC, nominated for Golden Globe and Viewers Choice awards.

Bullions,"[0, 0]","""Revenge"" is a beautiful soap opera about beautiful people in beautiful settings doing indescribably ugly things.Emily Thorne (Emily VanCamp) is a pretty young socialite buying a house in the Hamptons - Emily doesn't paint a very vivid picture of her past to her new neighbors, but she essentially wants to be seen as a girl-next-door type. However, Emily's hiding a secret plan to take all of these people down. Her father was convicted over a crime he didn't commit by the Graysons - crooked businessman Conrad and his wife, the quietly destructive Victoria, played fabulously by Madeleine Stowe.While Emily moves quietly forward in her master plan, not every one of her targets is killed. Often, she will see to it that her victim is publicly ridiculed and disgraced, just how she once felt. Once she discovers that the Graysons aren't just responsible for her father's incarceration, but also his death, the gloves quickly come off. Emily isn't completely cold-hearted, however. She falls in love with Daniel Grayson, the prodigal son, and she reconnects with a childhood friend, Jack, who owns a local watering hole. Emily has since changed her name, and her appearance. Jack doesn't know who she really is, and a subtle love triangle is created.Gorgeous cinematography of The Hamptons (or where ever the set was that the production department dressed up as the Hamptons), provides for a sense of escapism, but you know that awful things are happening behind closed doors. Scandals are everywhere; and you never really know what anybody's true intentions are.While this first season of ""Revenge"" in no way wraps up the saga of Emily's revenge, so many doors are opened for fantastic storytelling in the show's second season. I don't want to give any spoilers here, because the beauty of this show is the way that it starts out subtle, and slowly draws the viewer in, until they can't wait to see what happens next. In this first season, cliffhangers are abundant, but everything is done so well (in the final episode, particularly), the audience knows that anything could really happen when the show returns in the fall.I was a viewer of Desperate Housewives for years, and when it was announced that ""Revenge"" would be taking its spot in the fall of 2012, I knew I would need something to watch on Sunday evenings. I picked up the DVD of season one, and got a pretty good deal. Like I said, the show doesn't get terribly exciting until you're about five episodes in. Once that happens, you won't let go. I finished the DVD of 22 episodes in a weekend. Worthwhile characters are created, and the feeling that nobody will come out unscathed lingers in the air.

1492879,A1RO53YG6XST7I,B005LAJ212,"Peety R. Arblaster ""Eclectic Collector""","[0, 0]","I truly do love this show, at least the first season.  It captures a person's attention and holds it until the end.  Unfortunately the writers give away too much.It is about a Woman named Amanda Clarke who is hell-bent on revenge because her father was framed for helping terrorists and then murdered in prison.  Amanda calls herself Emily Thorne.  She has a photograph of everyone who she blames for her father's downfall and as a result her ruined childhood that was spent in institutions, mostly.  There is only one person who is truly looking out for Emily and that is Nolan Ross, a billionaire who gave Amanda/Emily 49% of his company on her 18th birthday.  Nolan wants to help Amanda/Emily because her father gave him money from his personal account to fund the start-up of Nolan company.  Victoria and her husband Conrad Grayson are at the top of Amanda/Emily's takedown list.  Victoria is the only one who even close to being as manipulative and clever as Amanda/Emily.  Amanda/Emily engages in a relationship with Victoria's son, Daniel.  Eventually Amanda/Emily finds out that Victoria's younger child, a teenage girl named Charlotte is really her half-sister.  A good guy, Jack, who knew Amanda/Emily as a child and has no idea who she is now falls in love with her and pursues her while she is dating Daniel. For the most part Amanda/Emily just sets up the traps and like dominos, one by one the people she has set the traps up for walk directly into them and one by one they fall down.What is clear is that Amanda/Emily's quest for revenge quickly turns into a quest for vigilante justice.  The writers obviously can't tell the difference between the 2.  The main and primarily the only difference is that people who want revenge don't care who they hurt, innocent or not, or who they have to knock down , innocent or not, to take down the people who they want to get revenge upon.  Those who seek vigilante justice do care who they hurt in the process and they go out of their way not to hurt innocent people or people who aren't their targets.  Amanda/Emily goes out of her not only to not hurt others who haven't, in her mind earned it, but she goes out of her way to protect Daniel and a few others who need protecting, not only from their direct enemies but from a few of Amanda's as well.My truly big problem with this show is that the writers give away too much and insinuate, to some small degree how the show is going to continue.  Not only that but it isn't hard, for someone that is really paying attention, to figure out how it will probably end.The writers show how Amanda was on a path of self-destruction until she found out and began to believe that her father was innocent.  That gave her a purpose.  They insinuate that Amanda will continue on the path that she is on until she somehow finds her way back, to some degree, to who she was before her father was ever arrested.  After that, and I am only guessing here, but Amanda will probably abandon her life in the Hamptons and find a new one where manipulation and deceit aren't a part of everyday life.Overall the show is pretty good.  The problem is that it is too predictable and it is easy to figure out how it will probably ULTIMATELY END.",4,A Wrongly Titled Show,1370563200,"06 7, 2013",2013,3226,"['truly', 'do', 'love', 'show', 'least', 'first', 'season', 'person', 'attention', 'end', 'Unfortunately', 'writers', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much.It', 'Woman', 'named', 'Amanda', 'Clarke', 'who', 'hell-bent', 'revenge', 'father', 'was', 'framed', 'helping', 'terrorists', 'then', 'murdered', 'prison', 'Amanda', 'Emily', 'Thorne', 'photograph', 'everyone', 'who', 'father', 'downfall', 'result', 'ruined', 'childhood', 'was', 'spent', 'institutions', 'mostly', 'only', 'one', 'person', 'who', 'truly', 'looking', 'out', 'Emily', 'Nolan', 'Ross', 'billionaire', 'who', 'gave', 'Amanda/Emily', '49', '%', 'company', '18th', 'birthday', 'Nolan', 'help', 'Amanda/Emily', 'father', 'gave', 'money', 'personal', 'account', 'fund', 'start-up', 'Nolan', 'company', 'Victoria', 'husband', 'Conrad', 'Grayson', 'are', 'top', 'Amanda/Emily', 'takedown', 'list', 'Victoria', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'even', 'close', 'being', 'manipulative', 'clever', 'Amanda/Emily', 'Amanda/Emily', 'relationship', 'Victoria', 'son', 'Daniel', 'Eventually', 'Amanda/Emily', 'out', 'Victoria', 'younger', 'child', 'teenage', 'girl', 'named', 'Charlotte', 'really', 'half-sister', 'good', 'guy', 'Jack', 'who', 'knew', 'Amanda/Emily', 'child', 'idea', 'who', 'now', 'love', 'dating', 'Daniel', 'most', 'part', 'Amanda/Emily', 'just', 'up', 'traps', 'dominos', 'one', 'one', 'people', 'set', 'traps', 'up', 'walk', 'directly', 'one', 'one', 'fall', 'clear', 'Amanda/Emily', 'quest', 'revenge', 'quickly', 'quest', 'vigilante', 'justice', 'writers', 'obviously', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'difference', '2', 'main', 'primarily', 'only', 'difference', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'revenge', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'who', 'hurt', 'innocent', 'not', 'who', 'have', 'knock', 'down', 'innocent', 'not', 'take', 'down', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'get', 'revenge', 'upon', 'who', 'seek', 'vigilante', 'justice', 'do', 'care', 'who', 'hurt', 'process', 'go', 'way', 'not', 'hurt', 'innocent', 'people', 'people', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'targets', 'Amanda/Emily', 'not', 'only', 'not', 'hurt', 'others', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'mind', 'earned', 'way', 'protect', 'Daniel', 'few', 'others', 'who', 'need', 'protecting', 'not', 'only', 'direct', 'enemies', 'few', 'Amanda', 'well.My', 'truly', 'big', 'problem', 'show', 'writers', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'insinuate', 'small', 'degree', 'how', 'show', 'going', 'continue', 'Not', 'only', ""n't"", 'hard', 'someone', 'really', 'paying', 'attention', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'will', 'probably', 'end.The', 'writers', 'show', 'how', 'Amanda', 'was', 'path', 'self-destruction', 'found', 'out', 'began', 'believe', 'father', 'was', 'innocent', 'gave', 'purpose', 'insinuate', 'Amanda', 'will', 'continue', 'path', 'somehow', 'way', 'back', 'degree', 'who', 'was', 'father', 'was', 'ever', 'arrested', 'am', 'only', 'guessing', 'here', 'Amanda', 'will', 'probably', 'abandon', 'life', 'Hamptons', 'find', 'new', 'one', 'where', 'manipulation', 'deceit', 'are', ""n't"", 'part', 'everyday', 'life.Overall', 'show', 'pretty', 'good', 'problem', 'too', 'predictable', 'easy', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'will', 'probably', 'ULTIMATELY', 'END']",Revenge: Season 1

Intrigued, I went on to channel 4 On Demand and watched the first episode becoming instantly hooked. Unfortunately in the UK, we haven't finished the first season yet, but I had to post a review. Loving this.The Good:Emily Thorne/Amanda Clarke is outstanding. She's dedicated, driven and definitely not some fluffy girl waiting to be rescued. I am with this character every step of the way and most of that is down to Emily Van Camp's acting. In the blink of an eye, she changes character, from sweet Emily Thorne to angry Amanda Clarke. Love her totally.Nolan Ross: Amazing character, has some of the best lines in the show and I am just loving his connection to Emily. So shipping these two, but the writers keep thinking that we care about the overly handsome Jack and Daniel.Victoria Grayson: Oh so broken and calculating. Smother dearest comes to mind and Madeline Stowe does an outstanding job.Conrad Grayson: Delightfully vicious.Daniel Grayson: Interesting to see which way he is going to go. I actually don't mind the pairing with Emily, it works, just a shame that the writers can't seem to stop turning this into a total soap.Takeda: Although a bit character, he's still wonderful.Unfortunately there is some bad:Jack Porter: Dull and mildly stalkerish. I find it appalling that we're meant to root for a relationship between two people, who supposedly met for one summer when they were 10. I find it creepy that Jack remembers Amanda so much that he names a boat after her and dates someone who claims to be her. I know there are shippers for this pairing and I can't understand it. I think you're supposed to root for this 'good guy' but there is no chemistry between the two actors and Jack is as dull as soup. Hate the character and forced pairing, feels out of place and every time he's on the screen, the pace vanishes.Charlotte Grayson: Her descent into drug addition is forced and feels unreal.

Everyone getting onto me about ""oh how could you not like this show? Its about a little girl who gets her Dad taken away from her! (now considering that I cant stand kids, my reply is a quick ""Good!"" But hey, a lot of you out there dont hold the same dislike for those little pains in the butt that I do so I'll try to look at it from a neutral standpoint. a guy gets killed at the beginning. We dont know who it is they wont tell us. We have to figure it out for ourselves. We can only assume its the guy Emily is suppose to be marrying (they are getting married, right?). Then we see a little girl at a beach house (im guessing this is Emily as a child?)Then a bit later we see a video being played which again (assuming) that this is a news cast of Emily's Dad being arrested or whatever turns out he was responsible for some terrorist act or something that caused a plane to crash and kill everyone. The company he worked for turned him in and I guess little Miss Emily is mad about that. Now, theres nothing that I saw that said the guy was innocent. This is just something you have to assume. I dont like assumptions. So here you have the majority saying the guy did it, there was obviously a trial and he was found guilty, and he died in prison. Now, maybe he was innocent. Maybe he was framed idk. But im sorry I just cant get into this show. Too many assumptions have to be made and they have to be made a certain way. Im sorry but I need more heck a lot more than subtle hints being thrown out at me. I need more than facial grimaces and shoulder shrugs. I cant read a person by the way they hold their cell phone. Perhaps this isnt a show for middle age ppl but rather the 20-ish crowd. Heck the way I see it, if the guy was framed and those ppl had something to do with it, she lost her Dad and that family lost their son. Theres your revenge right there. It isnt going to bring your Dad back so just let it go. Youve both lost so now move on.

1492884,A1EUI8FA4KNV95,B005LAJ212,Rissi,"[0, 0]","Writing characters that viewers will actually want to invite into their home on a weekly basis is a tricky business; ideally, they are imperfect but strive for self improvement. There is an oh-so-fine line between creating characters who are a little bit naughty and characters to root for - to laugh with and applaud for. Revenge took a stab at perfecting the former though even in its prism of enchanting darkness, I am not sure we should blindly buy into this scenario.Childhood memories are sunny days on the beach for Amanda Clarke. Hers was one anyone may envy. But that was before her father's former business associates ruined him... before every one of his friends turned against David Clarke (James Tupper). Now, close to twenty years later, Amanda has disappeared... in her place steps Emily Thorne (Emily VanCamp). Wealthy beyond her years, Emily has a trust fund and is the ""new girl"" summering at the Hamptons. Renting the elaborate summer home of the recently separated Lydia Davis (Amber Vallenta), Emily falls in love with the home and despite Lydia's claim she won't let her ex sell, her life is ruined when she is caught having an affair with Conrad Grayson (Henry Czerny), one of Hampton's most powerful families. Married for 25 years to his wife, Victoria (Madeline Stowe), Conrad is a successful businessman whose wife finds power and prestige more important than the ruination of her own dreams.Returning home after last summer's tragic accident, Daniel Grayson (Joshua Bowman) has made himself a promise to never drink again. His mother expects her beloved son to keep to this ""agreement"" while his father wants him to go into the family investment business. It isn't until Daniel meets Emily that everything changes. Her influence on Daniel is one of the best things that ever happened to him but Victoria is suspicious of the newcomer and keeps a close watch on her son's new fling. What no one knows is that Emily is that forgotten little girl, Amanda... and she is out for revenge on everyone who wronged her father. The one snag in her otherwise perfect plan is Jack (Nick Wechsler)... the boy she once loved.Wow. That was my reaction after watching an entire six-block of episodes of this first season of ABC's latest, soapy nighttime drama in one sitting. My mother and I were glued to the television and did not intend to watch more than two episodes but - much to our shock - we continued to hit ""play"" after the credits rolled on each episode. The writing is clever as each plot twists and thickens prompting us to discuss where the show was going multiple times though that doesn't mean this show is for everyone. From a story-telling perspective, this could have been brilliant, and in fact, in more outlets than one, it is. Based off of - or perhaps I should say ""inspired by"" - and loosely at that, the Dumas classic tale of revenge, 'The Count of Monte Cristo,' this Mike Kelley created show had so much going for it.The first five to eight episodes are structured nearly exactly alike. They all pick a victim for Emily to target and along with her trusty red Sharpie marker, she ""ruins"" those responsible for her father's demise. After a ""poisoned"" childhood, it wasn't until she came of age that truth was revealed and she discovered that her father left her a legacy of wealth, and a box filled with truth. The hatred she feels for the family festers and makes her into a person even she begins to question. As a result, the characters actions - particularly those of Emily since she is the heroine, constantly let us down though glimpses remind us they are human even behind their cool demeanors (to say nothing of their soft-spoken words and sweet smiles that are really just hiding sinister tricks!). There are times when I love Emily and Daniel to death but I detest what they ultimately did to Daniel and furthermore their season two plans for him. There is one moment when we think Emily is about to forget everything and actually live her life but her vendetta has gone too far by then. Likewise, an old friend in Nolan is likable - sometimes. Now there are ""rumors"" about Nolan and Emily together as a couple though I much prefer them as friends - Emily has a lot of things she needs to set right, some even about her own self, but Nolan is not the romantic match for her. They are better as friends and he is the voice of reason keeping her from reaching insanity.To be honest, I will say that I found this show fantastically good. It is not morally decent and in that way, I was let down by it multiple times BUT judging only the mystery, this can hold its own and then some. If you are looking for a narrative that gives its audience warm, fuzzy characters, you'd best look elsewhere but in all other respects, this is a well executed show (especially its beginning). The cast likewise is fabulous and the actress cast as the young Amanda is a perfect choice. I have two people to thank (blame?) for my interest in this show (well... other than ABC's promo) and they are my aunt and friend. For me, the show was worth seeing because I like a good mystery but I didn't watch it blind to the misguided themes. I cannot recommend it easily because some Christian's will likely not appreciate the subject material but if you don't mind wading through the whole revenge plot, you might find it entertaining. In the end, there is no promise Emily will learn anything - and that is, unarguably a depressing prospect.

When I watched the first episode I thought I was watching a suspense / mystery series, but soon I realized that was not the case and that instead it was a nighttime soap. I am usually not a big follower of this genre, but by the time I figured it out it was too late to let go. I realized that this series has enough mystery and suspense to keep me hooked, and the addition of some typical soap elements added instead of detracted from my enjoyment.There may be times in which it gets to be a little too soapy. But these moments are few an far between, and that is why I only took half a star away from the highest rating. The plot is extremely compelling. Who does not enjoy a good story about revenge? Moreover, the way in which the pieces of the puzzle are presented works wonders in keeping us engaged and watching episode after episodes. the jumps in time back and forth are well crafted and do not confuse the viewer whatsoever. Instead give us an idea of where the story is going and helps us focus our attention on details to see if we figure out how we got there.The cast is truly impressive, delivering praiseworthy performances. However, Madeleine Stowe shines above everyone else. In her role of the evil Victoria Grayson, she presents a manual on how to build a complex character and generate emotions in the viewer that many actors can only hope for in their dreams.My wife and I have been watching episodes of this series non-stop and after starting the second season it does not seem as if the pace is going to slow down anytime soon.

Step aside, Paris Hilton!Welcome Emily Thorne! Here's an admirable socialite who really knows how to spend her time and money wisely!If you are a victim of heinous crime or know someone who is, you need to watch and learn from this inspirational series! Emily's actions are justified and narrated through a series of flashbacks that are well crafted into each episode and ""take down"" of an enemy. Look at how all those evil people plotted to destroy her when she was just a cute, little child! First, they took away her daddy and murdered him through the ""legal system"", locked the little Emily (aka. Amanda Clarke) away, then brainwashed her into believing that her daddy was a bad guy. These cruel and unusual actions show that just because something is processed through the ""legal system"" or criminal justice system isn't always legal even though the process might APPEAR to be. Appearance can be illusionary as this series will prove. You will feel for Emily's character! Far from being ""revenge"", Emily teaches us what true justice is.Plot, plan, exact justice when the corrupt System doesn't work for innocent people! There's nothing better than taking justice in your own hands when everyone and everything has been taken away from you!What an inspiration, Emily Thorne! You go, girl!

However the more episodes I watched the more disappointed I became. It just became more of a soap opera to me than a cool revenge show. Now don't get me wrong, it's not a bad show. I like the main character Emily/Amanda. I also like Nolan and Jack. The other characters are a little to daytime soap for my taste, especially Charlotte. I hope she overdoses in an upcoming episode because she is annoying as hell. Saying that however, I admit that as much as I wanted to stop watching Revenge I found that I was still interested enough to stick with it as painful as much of the stupid dramatic scenes were. It's too bad this show is weighed down with so much soap drama nonsense. It could be a really cool show. I don't know if I will watch season two as the reviews suggest even more drama and less suspense.

1492895,A2PI38SNDNI13F,B005LAJ212,Taylor J. Huston,"[0, 0]","When I first heard of Revenge, I thought it was another ABC failed attempt to rise back to the top.  But when I watched the first episode, I was hooked and I bought the whole season on DVD.  The result: it is one of the best tv shows I have ever watched.The whole story is about a woman, who comes back to her family-home in the Hamptons and is looking to lay her past to rest.... literally.  The woman's name is Emily Thorne, but her real name is Amanda Clarke, and has returned to get revenge (title reference) on those who framed her father for a crime he didn't commit.  While searching to gain vengeance, Emily (or Amanda, whatever she likes to be called) runs into people from her past and also sets a series of events that will affect everything and everyone.The summary sounds like it lays everything out in front of you and you think that you have the whole thing figured out.  Well, if you do think that, you are wrong.  This story is planned out way bigger than the summary lets you believe.  Yes, it is about revenge, but it way more than that.  I'll review a little bit more and I promise to try to keep my spoilers to minimum.I really do love this first season of the series.  It was well-paced, well-written, fun to watch, exciting, and even sexy as hell.  The whole storyline starts off fresh (in its own way) and starts to build up towards a lot of things.  We are introduced to a lot of characters (who I will talk about in a little bit) and we also are given explanations to a ton of stuff.  We learn to what really happened to Amanda's father, David Clarke, and why he was imprisoned.  We also learn some really exciting secrets along the way.  One of which you will not see coming and will definitely leave you speechless and shocked (foreshadowing episode 12, ""Infamy"").As for the characters, they are done really well.  The main protagonist, Emily Thorne (real name, Amanda Clarke) is not exactly the type of girl who you would call ""nice"" or ""thoughtful"", at least when you are the one being targeted by her.  Emily is a troubled woman, who is out of revenge and doesn't care about anything or anyone (which we see change over the course of the season).  While it looks like she happy on the outside, you can quickly tell that she completely the opposite on the inside.  We also have Victoria Grayson (the main villain of the story), a woman who has a more troubled past than Emily.  Victory is portrayed as a deadly woman, who knows how to make threats with a single smile.  Unlike Emily, Victoria is filled with regret for the things she has done (a small reference to certain betrayal).  We also have the great Nolan Ross, who Emily's closest and most loyal friend.  Nolan is more of the comic relief of the story and also the backup for Emily's plan for revenge.  Trust me, Nolan will bring out a few laughs out of you.  There is Jack Porter, who is a certain person from Emily's past and (sort of) a love interest to her as well.  We also meet Jack's little brother, Declan (who I swear looks like a more younger version of Orlando Bloom), who plays the love interest to a girl named Charlotte Grayson, who is the daughter of Victoria.  Keep in mind that Charlotte plays a big role for the season.  We also have Daniel Grayson, who is the son of Victoria and also Emily's second love interest in the season.  Daniel is more of the ""innocent"" boy who is looking to do something with his life and not have to be part of the Grayson family business.  And finally, we have Conrad Grayson, the husband to Victoria and father to both Daniel and Charlotte.  Conrad is the secondary villain of the series and plays a great role as well.  If there is one thing funnier than Nolan himself, it is the conversations between him and Victoria (trust me).  There are tons of other characters who play big roles in this story as well, but I think the series does a better job at introducing and explaining them.Sense we are talking about revenge, this series really does live up to the title and the expectations that comes with it.  ""Everything"" is almost about revenge.  Emily's motives are for revenge and so is her commitment to it.  Her everyday life and thoughts is pretty much revenge.  Not only that, but some other characters get revenge as well.  Somewhere along the way, we see someone getting back at someone who did wrong to them.  People may be think that this series goes to far, but if you actually watch the series, you will understand why Emily and others do what they have to do.  Especially Emily.  Out of all of the people in this series, Emily has the right to do what she has to do.  Her perfect life and father was taken away from her and she spent the rest of her life in a living hell.  The little girl who smiled and loved everything was killed when her father was framed and put in prison for a crime he didn't commit.  Heck, even after he was arrest Emily was going through a living hell of her own.  The nightmare was everlasting for Emily.  It left a huge impact on her and it looks like it will never go away.  If you truly want to understand why she wants revenge, just watch the freaking series and find out.  With me, I agree with Emily and say that she needs to do it.  I know I couldn't live on or have peace, knowing that the people who did evil are living like there is no tomorrow.  I believe that if justice can't be served, then revenge has to be.As for the ending, I won't say much about it.  I can't go heavily into it without revealing a few spoilers (if not all of them).  But I can say this, it ends on a high note and also reveals one more secret that leaves you wanting more.  In fact, this secret that comes with it is not even seen coming.  The ending was satisfying and leaves a lot of room for season two.  If you want to find out, you have to watch it, that is all I'm going to say.If you do think about it, Revenge feels more like a Count of Monte Cristo story.  It has the revenge story feeling and also that dark atmosphere that the novel had.  Not to mention that Amanda comes back with a new name and a lot of money, which she uses to get revenge on the rich (or those who framed her father).  That sounds a whole lot like Edmond Dantes to me.  If you read the story, then you can see the connection.  Also, some of the small time villains fit the description of a few villains from the novel too.  I do consider this series to be inspired by the Count of Monte Cristo and believe that it almost lives up to it as well.Is this a tv series that you would be interested in?  Well, if you like revenge stories and twists and turns, then I would say ""yes"".  But if you are the forgiving type and aren't really interested in vengeance, then I would say ""maybe not"".  Truth is, this is not a story about forgiveness.  Even Emily herself says this in the beginning and end of the first episode.  There is no forgiveness and no salvation, just revenge and darkness.  My personal opinion, I love revenge storylines and dark stories.  They always seem to make better stories and they seem to have something for everyone.I really do love this series and I highly recommend it for anyone.  It will shock you from beginning to end and will never once let you go to sleep without wondering happens next.  I say buy it and watch it with friends or family.  Heck, watch it with both!  Enjoy it and just have a great time!Revenge Season One is the best!",5,"Revenge is like the Count of Monte Cristo, but in a modren day perspective and with a whole new meaning of

What starts out as a checklist of payback slows to a melodic dish best served cold as Emily works to get payback for misdeeds done to her father. Over 16 episodes she pushes her way all over the board, passing pawns in the first episodes and bigger pieces later on, trying to get to the  bigger fish - the Graysons. We open at an engagement party filled with guests, moving through the people, when a body appears and everyone turns out to find Victoria Grayson crying. Her son is dead. We then go backward, detailing what happened in all its intricacy and who was involved, until we catch up and go a little bit beyond, showing what the show can become in Season 2. It gets a whole lot more complex as the piece move around.While the show seems like a soap at night in large part, the pieces being moved around are interesting. Everyone i knew liked the way it started and some wandered after more people and faces popped in and stayed in, but i liked it quite a bit. You have interesting plots that are sometimes flawed and wrinkled but that the show wears well anyhow, and you have nice acting throughout.I enjoy Emily VanCamp's portrayal of Emily and Madeleine Stowe's as Victoria Grayson. Gabriel Mann is also an interesting piece of the puzzle as Nolan and one that you constantly have to reconsider because he does a great job of evasion. Nick Welsher also does a great job as the love lost to the past. There's a variable who's who of interesting characters popping in and out, and they make things interesting as the show develops roots.If you missed it and want to know whether you want to check the series out of not, there are still previews of the first episode floating around. You get a lot of breakdown there, and most of the things you want to know will be answered - at least in part - by the time you get to the end. A few things happen along the way and you have to wonder about feelings, like love, popping in and clouding the idea of revenge conquering all.I think it was a solid 5/5, meaning I loved watching it weekly and am getting my order ready to go now.",5,Interesting show that transforms from one-off revenge plot per episode to a more complex overall  theme,1331251200,"03 9, 2012",2012,2145,"['Emily', 'Thorne', 'coming', 'town', 'revenge', 'coming', 'What', 'out', 'checklist', 'payback', 'melodic', 'dish', 'best', 'served', 'cold', 'Emily', 'get', 'payback', 'misdeeds', 'done', 'father', '16', 'episodes', 'way', 'board', 'passing', 'pawns', 'first', 'episodes', 'bigger', 'pieces', 'later', 'trying', 'get', 'bigger', 'fish', 'Graysons', 'open', 'engagement', 'party', 'filled', 'guests', 'moving', 'people', 'when', 'body', 'everyone', 'out', 'find', 'Victoria', 'Grayson', 'crying', 'son', 'dead', 'then', 'go', 'backward', 'detailing', 'what', 'happened', 'intricacy', 'who', 'was', 'involved', 'catch', 'up', 'go', 'little', 'bit', 'showing', 'what', 'show', 'can', 'become', 'Season', '2', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'complex', 'piece', 'move', 'show', 'soap', 'night', 'large', 'part', 'pieces', 'being', 'moved', 'are', 'interesting', 'Everyone', 'i', 'knew', 'liked', 'way', 'started', 'wandered', 'more', 'people', 'popped', 'stayed', 'i', 'liked', 'quite', 'bit', 'have', 'interesting', 'plots', 'are', 'sometimes', 'flawed', 'wrinkled', 'show', 'well', 'anyhow', 'have', 'nice', 'acting', 'throughout.I', 'enjoy', 'Emily', 'VanCamp', 'portrayal', 'Emily', 'Madeleine', 'Stowe', 'Victoria', 'Grayson', 'Gabriel', 'Mann', 'also', 'interesting', 'piece', 'puzzle', 'Nolan', 'one', 'constantly', 'have', 'reconsider', 'great', 'job', 'evasion', 'Nick', 'Welsher', 'also', 'great', 'job', 'love', 'lost', 'past', 'variable', 'who', 'who', 'interesting', 'characters', 'popping', 'make', 'things', 'interesting', 'show', 'roots.If', 'missed', 'want', 'know', 'want', 'check', 'series', 'not', 'are', 'still', 'previews', 'first', 'episode', 'floating', 'around', 'get', 'lot', 'breakdown', 'there', 'most', 'things', 'want', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'answered', 'least', 'part', 'time', 'get', 'end', 'few', 'things', 'happen', 'way', 'have', 'wonder', 'feelings', 'love', 'popping', 'clouding', 'idea', 'revenge', 'conquering', 'all.I', 'think', 'was', 'solid', '5/5', 'meaning', 'loved', 'watching', 'weekly', 'am', 'getting', 'order', 'ready', 'go', 'now']",Revenge: Season 1

Emily is a woman with beauty, A huge amount of money- it's not mentioned how much, but it seems to be in the 9 digits and a very loyal friend who is also the king of computer hacking.  Upon learning that her father was framed she decided to make it her life's work to avenge her father's imprisonment and death.Her father SUPPOSEDLY didn't want her to go down the path of revenge and yet upon his death he gifts her a box full of ways to go about it- including setting her up with a japanese revenge artist to train her in the art of vengence... uh...ya...The main problem I have with the show is it's soap opera campiness that sometimes takes over.  You get to see unbelievable things like a woman falling over 10 stories onto the roof of a car... who ends up not only surviving, but also with no scars or noticeable disability.  The writers seem to make up story lines that they don't always remember to finish either.  One of many examples: Little amanda was much younger and shorter when the FBI came to lock up her dad and seperate the two of them forever than she was in the scenes before that occured.  Obviously showing how the little actress was older and had grown by the time they decided to shoot those scenes in the latter half of the season.  It sometimes seems like the cast and production team puts more time and focus on how good everyone is dressed, how pretty they are and how everything looks than they do into the actual story-lines which is annoying.

It even pays not so subtle homage to soaps that came before it.  While never as campy as Dynasty, it's almost as grand.  And while it never quite develops the family dysfunction of Dallas, it comes close.  There are some plot holes that viewers will likely need to forgive.  And if I'm being picky, the show peaked three quarters of the way through, almost as if they were picked up for additional shows with little warning.  But what really sets this show apart from most modern day soaps and much of non-soaps as well is that it wonderfully allows the two female leads to drive all story.  Emily kicks butt both mentally and physically.  When was the last time we saw a soap with such a wonderfully wounded yet strong heroine?  You won't see Emily sacrificing herself for a man like on all of the destroyed daytime serials.  You won't see her backdown to anyone, including Grayson Matriarch (played deliciously by M. Stowe) and their scenes are some of the best highlights from a very strong season.  I hope the writing gets a bit tighter in the second season.  And I hope they resist the urge to go campy and over the top.  While it can't quite be called a thinking fan's soap, it's certainly doesn't require the viewer to lower his/her IQ to enjoy.
