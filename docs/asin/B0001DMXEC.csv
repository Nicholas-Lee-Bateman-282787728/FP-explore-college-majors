This is the first season of one of the best family dramas of all times.  The show is heartwarming and illustrates timeless messages like unconditional love and caring.  I grew up on this series and to think this season is almost 40 years old blows me away.  The casting is superb with standouts of course being Richard Thomas as John-Boy and Michael Learned as the mother Olivia.  Each episode stands the test of time and the video presentation here is superb.  The show looks and sounds great.  Five Emmy awards were won for this first season.  My favorite episode is the expanded special AN EASTER STORY where Olivia develops polio.  It touched me deeply when it aired originally and to now see it again it is just as emotional.  It is rare for a series to be able to present realistic heartfelt love and emotion episode after episode and THE WALTONS achieved that throughout its entire run.  Each character grew and went thru their trials and tribulations but the warmth and true feelings that held this show together still ring true just as strong as when first aired.

And it always did.  I truly enjoy getting lost in this series. Ralph Waite as John Walton seems the true seasoned, simple folk kind of father, and Michael Learned as Liv Walton embraces her life with grace and heart. Season One gives viewers the boundless foundation to follow this family's plights through a difficult time of our country's history. The simple answers were not complicated. There isn't anything complicated about whether it is right or wrong. It is one or the other. John Walton told his children this truth. Liv Walton hugged and loved her children and was her husband's true partner.

Premiering on CBS in the Fall of 1972, the hour-long drama series chronicled the lives of a tightly-knit mountain family living during the Depression era. Creator Earl Hamner Jr. based The Waltons on his true-to-life story of growing up in the Hamner family. Noted for its family-oriented subject matter (and absence of torrid sex and violence), The Waltons paved the way for the success of the popular TV series Little House On The Prairie (1974). And, in the aftermath of the cancellation of The Beverly Hillbillies (1962) and Green Acres (1965), proved wrong the assertion of some CBS executives that shows with rural settings were becoming unpopular. Celebrated for its raw depiction of the human experience, The Waltons towers above modern day television dramas by laying claim to the added weight today's critics give to ""realism"" in a series while simultaneously avoiding the bad language, adult content, and gratuitous violence that often accompany those shows which earn such a designation...The Waltons follows the daily lives of the various members of the Walton family as they make a living working their humble saw mill on Walton's Mountain in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia. Set in the 1930's, the series unfolds through the eyes of John Boy (Richard Thomas). An aspiring writer, John Boy chronicles life on Walton Mountain where his parents, John Sr. (Ralph Waite) and Olivia (Michael Learned), raise their seven children (John Boy, Jason, Mary Ellen, Erin, Ben, Jim-Bob, and Elizabeth) with the aid of live-in grandparents Esther (Ellen Corby) and Zeb (Will Greer) Walton. A wide array of supporting characters live near the Waltons, including Reverend Fordwick (portrayed by Three's Company star John Ritter), the Godseys, the Baldwins, and various others. As the trials of the Great Depression fade into the tribulations of World War II, the Waltons connect with every facet of the human experience - love, marriage, birth, death, aging, social ills, and the numerous travails of life, making The Waltons one of the most popular shows in television history...The Waltons (Season 1) DVD features a number of memorable episodes including the series premiere ""The Foundling"" in which a young girl named Holly is left on the doorstep of the Walton family. Following a checkup with the family pediatrician, they learn that Holly is deaf.

I grew up with them and actually fantasized I was a part of their wonderful close-knit family. Now, with the release of this DVD set, I can once again experience that warm, fuzzy feeling every time I view an episode. This set is great. The prints are superb but do show some very minor age spots in places, especially at the beginnings of the episodes. The shows appears to be un-cut, however it's been so long since I've seen one, it's difficult to tell. The stories are cohesive and the running time indicates that they are complete. I have only one minor bone to pick, though and that is at the end of each episode, the announcer says, ""stay tuned for scenes from the next episode of the Waltons"".....but they don't show the scenes.....that end tag would have made this set perfect but leaving them out does not detract from the un-edited programs. Maybe they will add the preview tags to any future season releases; hope so at any rate. I still rate this set a 5 star.

Revisiting Walton's Mountain can bring back some great memories.  For those who stuck with the show throughout the run and watched in dismay as Richard Thomas, Will Geer, Ellen Corby, Michael Learned and finally Ralph Waite drifted away, the first season has everybody in fine form. The kids are cute without being saccharine, the stories are a fine balance of drama and humor and the acting and pacing are well done. This show may seem too slow to some, but life on the Mountain was leisurely, so the show should be also.There are some complaints that despite the narration at the beginning of the episode telling us how isolated they were that a lot of people seemed to stumble upon that mountain: well, this is certainly true. I think the strongest episodes were those that took place within the community, and not with outsiders who always found a lesson to be learned from the Waltons.As the first season progresses, each child gains their personality.  Jon Walmsley, my favorite, is also a very talented musician and his character Jason, the second oldest, is a good counterpoint to Richard Thomas' often cranky and annoyed John Boy.This is a good place to start if you've never seen the show.

The Creator Earl Hamner Jr. based the series on his own childhood, which he previously fictionalized in his novel, ""Spencer's Mountain"". The Waltons debuted on with Richard Thomas playing the role of John Boy Walton. In the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia, during the Great Depression, the Walton family makes its small income from its saw mill on Walton's Mountain. The story is told through the eyes of John Boy, who wants to be a novelist, goes to college, and eventually fulfills his dream. The saga follows the family through depression and war, and through growing up, school, courtship, marriage, employment, birth, aging, illness and death. This is the true story of the Waltons. The show takes place during the Depression and then during World War II. The other case members were as followed Ralph Waite played the role of John Walton Sr. Michael Learned played the role Oliva Walton, Judy Norton Taylor played the role of Marry Ellen, Jon Walmsley played the role of Jason Walton, Mary Beth McDonough played the role of Erin Walton, Eric Scott played the role of Ben Walton, David Harper played the role of Jim Bob Walton, Kami Cotler played the role of Elizabeth Walton, Will Greer played the role Grandpa and Ellen Corby played the role of Grandma. Other original characters included Joe Conley as general store owner, Ike Godsey, John Crawford as Sheriff Ep Bridges, Mariclare Costello as schoolteacher Miss Rosemary Hunter and Helen Kleeb and Mary Jackson as eccentric sisters-- Mamie and Emily Baldwin, respectively. The Waltons' first season brought critical acclaim and several awards. Both Richard Thomas and Michael Learned took home Best Actor Emmys, Ellen Corby was awarded the Best Supporting Actress honor and the series was given the Emmy for Outstanding Drama Series. The show also earned Emmys for writing and editing in addition to receiving the prestigious Peabody award. The series entered the top-ten in its second season and finished second that year to All in the Family. The show remained in the top twenty for the next few seasons and received several more Emmys, including two more for both Michael Learned and Ellen Corby and a Best Supporting Actor award for Will Geer. In all, The Waltons received 37 Emmy nominations and took home 13 of the golden statuettes. Three reunion movies have been produced in the 1990s for CBS. ""A Walton Thanksgiving Reunion"" (1993), ""A Walton Wedding"" (1995) and ""A Walton Easter"" (1997) all feature the original cast with the exception of the late Will Geer. The series opened in the fall of September 1972 with the first episode titled The Foundling. A six-year old deaf and dumb girl is abandoned on the Walton's doorstep. With loving care they teach her to ""talk"" with sign language. But their kindness to the foundling causes a family crisis. Elizabeth, playing hide-and-seek with the deaf and dumb girl Holly, runs into an old abandoned shack and hides inside an empty trunk, but the lid falls shut and locks itself. Holly sees what has happened and runs to get help but is picked up by her father who doesn't understand sign language and takes her away. John and the family pursue and Holly then tells them by sign language what has occurred, and Elizabeth is rescued in time. Holly's parents now realize that their little girl is not retarded and are now able to communicate with her.",5,The Best Family Show to Hit The Air waves In Its Time,1172793600,"03 2, 2007",2007,3549,"['year', 'was', '1972', 'when', 'show', 'hit', 'airwave', 'CBS', 'September', '14', 'weekly', 'series', 'Waltons', 'was', 'based', 'large', 'close-knit', 'family', 'living', 'rural', 'Virginia', 'Depression', 'Creator', 'Earl', 'Hamner', 'Jr.', 'based', 'series', 'own', 'childhood', 'previously', 'fictionalized', 'novel', 'Spencer', 'Mountain', 'Waltons', 'debuted', 'Richard', 'Thomas', 'playing', 'role', 'John', 'Boy', 'Walton', 'Blue', 'Ridge', 'Mountains', 'Virginia', 'Great', 'Depression', 'Walton', 'family', 'small', 'income', 'saw', 'mill', 'Walton', 'Mountain', 'story', 'told', 'eyes', 'John', 'Boy', 'who', 'be', 'novelist', 'college', 'eventually', 'dream', 'saga', 'family', 'depression', 'war', 'growing', 'up', 'school', 'courtship', 'marriage', 'employment', 'birth', 'aging', 'illness', 'death', 'true', 'story', 'Waltons', 'show', 'place', 'Depression', 'then', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'other', 'case', 'members', 'were', 'followed', 'Ralph', 'Waite', 'played', 'role', 'John', 'Walton', 'Sr.', 'Michael', 'Learned', 'played', 'role', 'Oliva', 'Walton', 'Judy', 'Norton', 'Taylor', 'played', 'role', 'Marry', 'Ellen', 'Jon', 'Walmsley', 'played', 'role', 'Jason', 'Walton', 'Mary', 'Beth', 'McDonough', 'played', 'role', 'Erin', 'Walton', 'Eric', 'Scott', 'played', 'role', 'Ben', 'Walton', 'David', 'Harper', 'played', 'role', 'Jim', 'Bob', 'Walton', 'Kami', 'Cotler', 'played', 'role', 'Elizabeth', 'Walton', 'Will', 'Greer', 'played', 'role', 'Grandpa', 'Ellen', 'Corby', 'played', 'role', 'Grandma', 'Other', 'original', 'characters', 'included', 'Joe', 'Conley', 'general', 'store', 'owner', 'Ike', 'Godsey', 'John', 'Crawford', 'Sheriff', 'Ep', 'Bridges', 'Mariclare', 'Costello', 'schoolteacher', 'Miss', 'Rosemary', 'Hunter', 'Helen', 'Kleeb', 'Mary', 'Jackson', 'eccentric', 'sisters', 'Mamie', 'Emily', 'Baldwin', 'respectively', 'Waltons', 'first', 'season', 'brought', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'several', 'awards', 'Richard', 'Thomas', 'Michael', 'Learned', 'took', 'home', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Emmys', 'Ellen', 'Corby', 'was', 'awarded', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'honor', 'series', 'was', 'given', 'Emmy', 'Outstanding', 'Drama', 'Series', 'show', 'also', 'earned', 'Emmys', 'writing', 'editing', 'addition', 'receiving', 'prestigious', 'Peabody', 'award', 'series', 'entered', 'top-ten', 'second', 'season', 'finished', 'second', 'year', 'Family', 'show', 'remained', 'top', 'twenty', 'next', 'few', 'seasons', 'received', 'several', 'more', 'Emmys', 'including', 'two', 'more', 'Michael', 'Learned', 'Ellen', 'Corby', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'award', 'Will', 'Geer', 'Waltons', 'received', '37', 'Emmy', 'nominations', 'took', 'home', '13', 'golden', 'statuettes', 'Three', 'reunion', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'produced', '1990s', 'CBS', 'A', 'Walton', 'Thanksgiving', 'Reunion', '1993', 'Walton', 'Wedding', '1995', 'A', 'Walton', 'Easter', '1997', 'feature', 'original', 'cast', 'exception', 'late', 'Will', 'Geer', 'series', 'opened', 'fall', 'September', '1972', 'first', 'episode', 'titled', 'Foundling', 'six-year', 'old', 'deaf', 'dumb', 'girl', 'abandoned', 'Walton', 'doorstep', 'loving', 'care', 'teach', 'talk', 'sign', 'language', 'kindness', 'foundling', 'family', 'crisis', 'Elizabeth', 'playing', 'hide-and-seek', 'deaf', 'dumb', 'girl', 'Holly', 'old', 'abandoned', 'shack', 'hides', 'empty', 'trunk', 'lid', 'shut', 'Holly', 'what', 'happened', 'get', 'help', 'picked', 'up', 'father', 'who', ""n't"", 'understand', 'sign', 'language', 'away', 'John', 'family', 'pursue', 'Holly', 'then', 'sign', 'language', 'what', 'occurred', 'Elizabeth', 'rescued', 'time', 'Holly', 'parents', 'now', 'realize', 'little', 'girl', 'not', 'retarded', 'are', 'now', 'able', 'communicate']",The Waltons: Season 1

I'll be honest, though.  Being hard of hearing myself which meant I couldn't easily understand the dialogues involved, I didn't really care much for this one.  I could see well, though, so the better whatever looked, the better I'd like whatever it is.  Thus, this show didn't quite win me over, at least not yet.  However, as I got older I'd get used to it, to the point I'd enjoy it somewhat.  Little House on the Pairie, apparently NBC's answer to this show, did win me over right away as the scenes involving the kids looked more colorful and interesting.  Anyway, not too long ago I'd note that TW seemed somewhat dull, but I know that's not the point.  The point of this series is to inspire, and it's better found in the lessons imparted by characters relevant to the episode than whatever meets the eye.

801623,AYS05FEGASUC,B0001DMXEC,Jim Mitchell,"[15, 17]","Wow.  This brings back memories of Thursday nights, eating popcorn and watching The Waltons with my family. Sentiment and nostalgia are not necessarily bad things.  I'm too young to remember the first few seasons, but these characters are imbedded in my imagination and memory almost as much as other, bigger pop culture phenomena of my childhood in the 70s such as Star Wars.  I've always liked The Waltons, and would never have dismissed it as sappy or maudlin, but I didn't realize that I'd enjoy it as much as I have after watching this DVD set of the first season.  Before getting this set for my birthday, my wife and I were talking about how we missed having a series that the whole family could watch- we have our adult shows and the kids have their shows on Nick and Disney, but there's no middle ground for all of us to enjoy.  So I received The Waltons for my birthday, and we've been enjoying it for the past few months watching one or two episodes a week.The show, as I said, is as good as I remember it.  The characters seem very realistic to me- they're attrative but not terribly glamorous, and they're simple and decent people but not simplistic or self-righteous.  The first season is a bit rough around the edges, and the characters of the individual children (all seven of them) take a while to completely take shape.  But you can see the beginnings of personalities and storylines and quirks that remain throughout much of the show.  Will Geer as ""The Grandfather"" is particularly memorable- what a fine actor and character, and what a loss when he passed away later on in the shows run.  And if you were used to later seasons of the show, you also tend to forget what a central role Richard Thomas played as John Boy and what a good, likable actor he is (why they brought him back with another actor in the last few seasons is difficult to understand, but you don't need to dwell on that in the early seasons).  Many of the neighbors and friends are here in their wonderful supporting roles:  Ike (Corabeth comes to Walton's Mountain a few seasons later), the Baldwin Sisters and the Recipe, Rev. Fordwick (a very young John Ritter) and Yancy Tucker.  The credits are a bit different- rather than the famous sepia-toned portraits of the characters, there's a scene of the family gathered on the porch with their new radio, and the familiar theme song is a bit more subdued.  But Earl Hamner's wonderful, almost poetic narration was there from the beginning, as are the famous ""Goodnights"" at the end of each episode.  So while I hope to see more seasons released on DVD, Season 1 is certainly a worthy beginning to this wonderful show.And again, don't be mislead by the many parodies and derisions of this show.  As warm and family-friendly as it can be, The Waltons often has a dark, melancholy edge to it.  Maybe Depression-era povery in rural Virginia wasn't quite as it's depicted on The Waltons, but there is plenty of suffering and hardship present that makes these stories realistic and relevant without going over-the-top in a ""Little House"" sort of way.  You get the sense that this is a real family that loved and lost through a crucial period in American history- the Depression and later World War II, both of which loom heavily over the entire series and drive many of the storylines.  I actually remember The Waltons as playing a significant role in my interest in history. The show was very good at driving home a lesson without being moralistic or preachy.  The writers and actors were able to convey a loving and decent family and community, while still giving them flaws that made them believable and empathetic. Still, despite the sometimes sobering elements, it's a wonderful show to share with children, who will hopefully learn to know the characters as much as we did when the show was first run.  As much as I love The Sopranos and 24 and NYPD Blue and any number of contemporary shows, it's nice to have something with substance and meaning to experience with the whole family.  Let's just hope that they don't stop with the first season...",5,Wonderfully Sentimental,1096416000,"09 29, 2004",2004,4087,"['Wow', 'back', 'memories', 'Thursday', 'nights', 'eating', 'popcorn', 'watching', 'Waltons', 'family', 'Sentiment', 'nostalgia', 'are', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'things', ""'m"", 'too', 'young', 'remember', 'first', 'few', 'seasons', 'characters', 'are', 'imbedded', 'imagination', 'memory', 'almost', 'as', 'much', 'other', 'bigger', 'pop', 'culture', 'phenomena', 'childhood', '70s', 'such', 'Star', 'Wars', ""'ve"", 'always', 'liked', 'Waltons', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'dismissed', 'sappy', 'maudlin', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', ""'d"", 'enjoy', 'as', 'much', 'have', 'watching', 'DVD', 'set', 'first', 'season', 'getting', 'set', 'birthday', 'wife', 'were', 'talking', 'how', 'missed', 'having', 'series', 'whole', 'family', 'could', 'watch-', 'have', 'adult', 'shows', 'kids', 'have', 'shows', 'Nick', 'Disney', 'middle', 'ground', 'enjoy', 'received', 'Waltons', 'birthday', ""'ve"", 'been', 'enjoying', 'past', 'few', 'months', 'watching', 'one', 'two', 'episodes', 'week.The', 'show', 'said', 'as', 'good', 'remember', 'characters', 'seem', 'very', 'realistic', 'me-', ""'re"", 'attrative', 'not', 'terribly', 'glamorous', ""'re"", 'simple', 'decent', 'people', 'not', 'simplistic', 'self-righteous', 'first', 'season', 'bit', 'rough', 'edges', 'characters', 'individual', 'children', 'seven', 'take', 'while', 'completely', 'take', 'shape', 'can', 'see', 'beginnings', 'personalities', 'storylines', 'quirks', 'remain', 'much', 'show', 'Will', 'Geer', 'Grandfather', 'particularly', 'memorable-', 'what', 'fine', 'actor', 'character', 'what', 'loss', 'when', 'passed', 'away', 'later', 'shows', 'run', 'were', 'used', 'later', 'seasons', 'show', 'also', 'tend', 'forget', 'what', 'central', 'role', 'Richard', 'Thomas', 'played', 'John', 'Boy', 'what', 'good', 'likable', 'actor', 'why', 'brought', 'back', 'actor', 'last', 'few', 'seasons', 'difficult', 'understand', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'dwell', 'early', 'seasons', 'Many', 'neighbors', 'friends', 'are', 'here', 'wonderful', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Ike', 'Corabeth', 'Walton', 'Mountain', 'few', 'seasons', 'later', 'Baldwin', 'Sisters', 'Recipe', 'Rev', 'Fordwick', 'very', 'young', 'John', 'Ritter', 'Yancy', 'Tucker', 'credits', 'are', 'bit', 'different-', 'rather', 'famous', 'sepia-toned', 'portraits', 'characters', 'scene', 'family', 'gathered', 'porch', 'new', 'radio', 'familiar', 'theme', 'song', 'bit', 'more', 'subdued', 'Earl', 'Hamner', 'wonderful', 'almost', 'poetic', 'narration', 'was', 'there', 'beginning', 'are', 'famous', 'Goodnights', 'end', 'episode', 'hope', 'see', 'more', 'seasons', 'released', 'DVD', 'Season', '1', 'certainly', 'worthy', 'beginning', 'wonderful', 'show.And', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'mislead', 'many', 'parodies', 'derisions', 'show', 'warm', 'family-friendly', 'can', 'be', 'Waltons', 'often', 'dark', 'melancholy', 'edge', 'Maybe', 'Depression-era', 'povery', 'rural', 'Virginia', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'depicted', 'Waltons', 'plenty', 'suffering', 'hardship', 'present', 'stories', 'realistic', 'relevant', 'going', 'over-the-top', 'Little', 'House', 'sort', 'way', 'get', 'sense', 'real', 'family', 'loved', 'lost', 'crucial', 'period', 'American', 'history-', 'Depression', 'later', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'loom', 'heavily', 'entire', 'series', 'drive', 'many', 'storylines', 'actually', 'remember', 'Waltons', 'playing', 'significant', 'role', 'interest', 'history', 'show', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'driving', 'home', 'lesson', 'being', 'moralistic', 'preachy', 'writers', 'actors', 'were', 'able', 'convey', 'loving', 'decent', 'family', 'community', 'still', 'giving', 'flaws', 'made', 'believable', 'empathetic', 'Still', 'sometimes', 'sobering', 'elements', 'wonderful', 'show', 'share', 'children', 'who', 'will', 'hopefully', 'learn', 'know', 'characters', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'when', 'show', 'was', 'first', 'run', 'As', 'much', 'love', 'Sopranos', '24', 'NYPD', 'Blue', 'number', 'contemporary', 'shows', 'nice', 'have', 'something', 'substance', 'meaning', 'experience', 'whole', 'family', 'Let', 'just', 'hope', 'do', ""n't"", 'stop', 'first', 'season']",The Waltons: Season 1

801627,A19XE6G6NDZFPS,B0001DMXEC,Joanna Mechlinski,"[7, 7]","With 21st century eyes, it's wonderful to see a family like the Waltons. Although they are scrabbling against poverty, living in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia during the Depression, they are happy. The large family, which includes seven children, parents, and grandparents, is loving and supportive. Sure, the kids aren't angels -- like any others, they squabble and have their problems. But when push comes to shove, they've got one another's backs, like when eldest sister Mary Ellen beats up a classmate for mocking little brother Jim Bob's shirt (made from sister Erin's old dress) or when eldest brother John-Boy defends Mary Ellen from a potential assault by a guest staying with the family.Most gratifying is the children's overall contentment. Sure, they aspire for ""things"" - they long to see a traveling circus that comes to the mountains, and they pause by toys displayed in the general store. But for the most part, they don't dwell upon what they don't have. They take contentment in life in general, and when the occasional treat comes their way, they truly appreciate it...unlike many kids today, whose parents buy them the latest iPods and video games, and it's STILL not enough.The Waltons' saga is told through the eyes of eldest son John-Boy, who is 17 and aspires to be a writer. He is based on Earl Hamner, a Virginia native who wrote ""Spencer's Mountain,"" the book upon which the show is based. Hamner does a voiceover in each episode, speaking as the adult John-Boy looking back on his childhood.(For the record, I'm 26 years old, not someone who grew up with this show, or looks down upon ""today's youth"" from the vantage of age. But, as you know, not all young folks are content with the attitudes of today's society as a rule. I, for one, truly wish we could return to a simpler time; it won't be long before our complicated lives lead us to self-destruct.)",5,"A strong family drama, well worth watching...",1174608000,"03 23, 2007",2007,1890,"['21st', 'century', 'eyes', 'wonderful', 'see', 'family', 'Waltons', 'are', 'scrabbling', 'poverty', 'living', 'Blue', 'Ridge', 'Mountains', 'Virginia', 'Depression', 'are', 'happy', 'large', 'family', 'seven', 'children', 'parents', 'grandparents', 'loving', 'supportive', 'Sure', 'kids', 'are', ""n't"", 'angels', 'others', 'squabble', 'have', 'problems', 'when', 'push', 'shove', ""'ve"", 'got', 'one', 'backs', 'when', 'eldest', 'sister', 'Mary', 'Ellen', 'up', 'classmate', 'mocking', 'little', 'brother', 'Jim', 'Bob', 'shirt', 'made', 'sister', 'Erin', 'old', 'dress', 'when', 'eldest', 'brother', 'John-Boy', 'Mary', 'Ellen', 'potential', 'assault', 'guest', 'staying', 'family.Most', 'gratifying', 'children', 'overall', 'contentment', 'Sure', 'aspire', 'things', 'long', 'see', 'traveling', 'circus', 'mountains', 'pause', 'toys', 'displayed', 'general', 'store', 'most', 'part', 'do', ""n't"", 'dwell', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'take', 'contentment', 'life', 'general', 'when', 'occasional', 'treat', 'way', 'truly', 'appreciate', 'many', 'kids', 'today', 'parents', 'buy', 'latest', 'iPods', 'video', 'games', 'STILL', 'not', 'enough.The', 'Waltons', 'saga', 'told', 'eyes', 'eldest', 'son', 'John-Boy', 'who', '17', 'aspires', 'be', 'writer', 'based', 'Earl', 'Hamner', 'Virginia', 'native', 'who', 'wrote', 'Spencer', 'Mountain', 'book', 'show', 'based', 'Hamner', 'voiceover', 'episode', 'speaking', 'adult', 'John-Boy', 'looking', 'back', 'childhood', 'record', ""'m"", '26', 'years', 'old', 'not', 'someone', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'show', 'down', 'today', 'youth', 'vantage', 'age', 'know', 'not', 'young', 'folks', 'are', 'content', 'attitudes', 'today', 'society', 'rule', 'one', 'truly', 'wish', 'could', 'return', 'simpler', 'time', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'long', 'complicated', 'lives', 'lead', 'self-destruct']",The Waltons: Season 1

It still is.The first season is available on DVD and is a good value although without frills. There is nothing to speak of in the way of commentaries or interviews and the purchaser must put up with the hassle of two sided disks but they are worth the effort.This set of the first season contains the following episodes:The Foundling - The Walton family wakes up to find an unexpected gift lying on the doorstep. It is an abandoned little girl. She seems half starved and does not respond to much of anything except with fear. She is deaf. Though times are hard and the first inclination is to let her go to an orphanage, the family decides to take her in for a while. The mother of the child is hiding out, keeping an eye on things. The father has given an ultimatum to put the child in a home but the mother doesn't want to do it. He thinks she is mentally dumb. She doesn't believe it and wants to find a nice family for her to live with. Her time with the Waltons is well spent. John-boy manages to start teaching her some sign language and the child becomes very popular with all of the family except for Elizabeth who is jealous. All is made well when Elizabeth gets lost and the little foundling girl manages to save the day by telling them where she is.The Carnival - The kids are excited about a carnival on Walton's Mountain but don't get to go because they can't afford it. The carnival breaks up when the manager runs off with the money and some of the carnies are stranded in the area. The Walton family offers some hospitality even though many are suspicious of them. The hospitality is repaid with kindness though the experience evokes a desire to travel in John-Boy.The Calf - A calf is born to the Walton family but it is a bull calf instead of a heifer. That means it will produce no income for the family. The axel on the family truck has broken and they need the money from selling the calf to pay for the axel. Unfortunately, the kids have adopted the animal and it is like losing a family member.The Hunt - John Boy is about to go on his first hunt with his father. He is nervous. He wants to do the ""manly"" thing and help provide for the table but the idea of killing bothers him. When the moment of truth comes, he finds he cannot pull the trigger and is ashamed of himself but redeems himself when he is called upon to use the gun to save a life.The Typewriter - John-boy finally finishes writing a story and sends it off to Collier's Magazine to try and get it published.

Trouble comes when Mary Ellen unknowingly sells his borrowed typewriter as junk.The Star - While sitting on the back porch one evening, the Walton family sees a shooting star.

801630,A10EICDA6FL5VK,B0001DMXEC,Johnny B. Quick,"[0, 0]","After a warmly received TV movie in 1971 called The Homecoming, creator Earl Hamner decided to make a TV show based on the same family called The Waltons. This move created a show that will never be forgotten in American history.The Waltons deals with a family of 11 named the Waltons as they face situations on their rural mountain home, Walton's Mountain. The show takes place during The Great Depression in 1933 and runs all the way up to 1946.

These stories, meticulously written and lovingly acted by a memorable cast of players, take us to the brink of sentiment but always manage to teach us wonderful lessons about growing up, generosity, kindness, and what it means to be a family and to be alive. My 11-year-old son and I watch an episode a night. He's learned the names of all the family members. It's good to know that nothing cynical or nasty will be appearing on this show as he watches it, and that he will come away with things to think about. There is an open-hearted and nonjudgmental generosity that circles this show, always open to new ideas and new people. Richard Thomas (John-Boy) possesses a wide-eyed wonder and a love of literature that is amazingly refreshing. And his father, John, and mother, Livia, listen to their children and give them the emotional room to grow. What a beautiful gift they've given them. Earl Hamner's narrative voice grounds us in a world of certain love even amidst economic and political chaos.

Instead, I will tell you why I feel this DVD set is perhaps is the best series that ever aired on TV, and is true family entertainment.The Waltons first aired in 1972 on CBS.  It was considered ""hokey"" by some of the critics of the day, yet it captured the hearts of the viewers and went on to be one of the finest long-running series on TV.  It captured peoples hearts because it told stories of real people, real people in a family that loved and cared for each other. Although many of the stories are of course fictional, the writer, Earl Hamner (who is actually John-boy), weaves fiction with real-life drama and shows how his loving family dealt with the hard times they grew up in, and how they related to each other with love.  In essence, the Waltons shows the viewer what all of us would like our families to be like. One cannot help caring about the characters because Hamner does such a great job of developing their unique personalities for us.  The actors and actresses that play his family are perfect for the parts, and even though many of them are just children, their realistic acting makes one believe they are actually a real family.  The series is carried on the shoulders of three central characters, John-Boy (Richard Thomas), his mother Olivia Walton (Michael Learned), and Father John Walton (played by Ralph Waite).  All three are absolutely superb in their respective roles, and earned honors and accolades for their depiction of Hamner's family.  When these three characters eventually left ths show in later years, the show itself folded.If you have never seen The Waltons on TV, this is the place to start.  The first season is perhaps the best, with stories that will make you laugh, cry, and cheer.  I watch the shows with my own 6 children and even in these modern days with so many other distractions, my kids are thrilled with the stories.  Each child relates to a particular Walton child, and after finishing an episode, they beg to watch another.Television does not get better than The Waltons.  I recommend this series for those viewers who desire more family values and less violence, sex, and questionable language and topics in their tv viewing.  This is true family values TV, and I wish we had something like it today.  The Waltons will capture your heart, and you will come to love the characters and care about them.  Thank you Earl Hamner for sharing your lovely family with us!Jim Konedog Koenig",5,The Waltons is True Family TV,1122422400,"07 27, 2005",2005,2592,"['Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'thoroughly', 'reviewed', 'details', 'Waltons', 'first', 'year', 'TV', 'titles', 'plot', 'descriptions', 'wo', ""n't"", 'elaborate', 'further', 'Instead', 'will', 'tell', 'why', 'feel', 'DVD', 'set', 'perhaps', 'best', 'series', 'ever', 'aired', 'TV', 'true', 'family', 'entertainment.The', 'Waltons', 'first', 'aired', '1972', 'CBS', 'was', 'considered', 'hokey', 'critics', 'day', 'captured', 'hearts', 'viewers', 'went', 'be', 'one', 'finest', 'long-running', 'series', 'TV', 'captured', 'peoples', 'hearts', 'told', 'stories', 'real', 'people', 'real', 'people', 'family', 'loved', 'cared', 'other', 'many', 'stories', 'are', 'course', 'fictional', 'writer', 'Earl', 'Hamner', 'who', 'actually', 'John-boy', 'fiction', 'real-life', 'drama', 'how', 'loving', 'family', 'dealt', 'hard', 'times', 'grew', 'up', 'how', 'related', 'other', 'love', 'essence', 'Waltons', 'viewer', 'what', 'would', 'like', 'families', 'be', 'One', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'caring', 'characters', 'Hamner', 'great', 'job', 'developing', 'unique', 'personalities', 'actors', 'actresses', 'play', 'family', 'are', 'perfect', 'parts', 'even', 'many', 'are', 'just', 'children', 'realistic', 'acting', 'one', 'believe', 'are', 'actually', 'real', 'family', 'series', 'carried', 'shoulders', 'three', 'central', 'characters', 'John-Boy', 'Richard', 'Thomas', 'mother', 'Olivia', 'Walton', 'Michael', 'Learned', 'Father', 'John', 'Walton', 'played', 'Ralph', 'Waite', 'three', 'are', 'absolutely', 'superb', 'respective', 'roles', 'earned', 'honors', 'accolades', 'depiction', 'Hamner', 'family', 'When', 'three', 'characters', 'eventually', 'left', 'ths', 'show', 'later', 'years', 'show', 'folded.If', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Waltons', 'TV', 'place', 'start', 'first', 'season', 'perhaps', 'best', 'stories', 'will', 'make', 'laugh', 'cry', 'cheer', 'watch', 'shows', 'own', '6', 'children', 'even', 'modern', 'days', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'distractions', 'kids', 'are', 'thrilled', 'stories', 'child', 'particular', 'Walton', 'child', 'finishing', 'episode', 'beg', 'watch', 'another.Television', 'not', 'get', 'better', 'Waltons', 'recommend', 'series', 'viewers', 'who', 'desire', 'more', 'family', 'values', 'less', 'violence', 'sex', 'questionable', 'language', 'topics', 'tv', 'viewing', 'true', 'family', 'values', 'TV', 'wish', 'had', 'something', 'today', 'Waltons', 'will', 'capture', 'heart', 'will', 'come', 'love', 'characters', 'care', 'Thank', 'Earl', 'Hamner', 'sharing', 'lovely', 'family', 'Jim', 'Konedog', 'Koenig']",The Waltons: Season 1

Everyone from baby to great great grandma sat down to watch it.  Told through the remembreances of John Walton Jr. nicknamed Johnboy (Ricahrd Thomas) we discovered what it was like to live on Walton's Mountain during the depression.  Times were hard but there was still fun to be had.  No doubt some folks will be reminded of their own lives when the world was much simpler and less wicked.  I am always reminded of my own passion for writing when John boy sits at his desk to write about everything he sees.Near the end of its run there are cast members who decide to leave the show.  Micheal Learned and Richard Thomas both left and the series did suffer from the loss although it went on for a good while without them.  Once they brought in someone to play an aunt who basically replaces the mother figure, the shows fate was sealed.During the first season, it is comforting to watch all of the cast find the right niche for their characters and become a complete family unit.  After awhile, the country accents become less forced and more natural.  Everyone eases into their roles and becomes quite comfy.Please treat your family to this dvd.

The series was a real gem and even today nearly 40 years after this first series was made, the quality shines through.Miss Michael Learned, Ralph Waite, Ellen Corby, Will Geer and Richard Thomas star as the main members of The Waltons clan experiencing a tough life in 1930's America. There are another six other regulars who make up the Waltons family.Each episode centres around a different story and features different guest stars, many of whom were big names in the early 1970s. This powerful series would run until 1981 and then return as several one off movies.Simple and moralistic, The Waltons is a far cry from the CGI infested programmes on our screens today. Scenes are longer than you will find on screen today as there is no desperation to hold the viewers attention in those days. The quality of the series itself was the magnet which drew viewers to the show.I particularly love the episodes featuring the Baldwin sisters. Their father's ""Recipe"" and it's reactions around the Walton household still amuse me to this day.

""Did you go into the woods without asking? Get up the steps and get ready for a lickin'."" ""You said NO?!""...you can imagine what happened on that one) who were born in the '20s and grew up in the depression, was interesting because I could identify with the characters. It was also interesting to hear mom and dad make comparisons to the way the Waltons lived. They said that the Waltons had it good! They had electric, meat, sugar...these were luxuries at that time. In a way, it was silly to compare real life to Hollywood scripts, but watching this show always made them remember that era and always resulted in some interesting story telling.But aside from all of that, it's really nice to have the first season of the Waltons on DVD. I think the quality is very good. The sound is also very good. It's a relief to hear some reviewers talk about the present state of television. I thought I was all alone in my assessment.

801660,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,B0001DMXEC,Simon Davis,"[16, 16]","I feel in alot of ways that I grew up with the Walton children as the classic depression era series &quot;The Waltons&quot;, was a regular part of our family viewing for years on a Sunday night here in Melbourne. It was always with great anticipation that we tuned in to see what would unfold that week for our favourite TV family. Whether the storyline dealt with John Boy struggling to get his first book published, Olivia battling a severe attack of polio, Grandpa feeling lonely while Grandma was in hospital or Erin deciding to raise a baby faun we were guaranteed a well crafted, beautifully written and acted story that while on the sentimental side always had elements of hard reality in them. None of the Walton family were perfect and that was one of the great strengths of the series where we got to enjoy people who were decent and inherently good individuals but who from time to time succumbed to their personal weaknesses and temptations like we all do on occasion.It is wonderful that season one of the multi Emmy award winning &quot;The Waltons&quot;,has now received the proper DVD release that it so richly deserves. Being the brain child of creator Earl Hamner Jnr who based the series on his own childhood in Virginia. &quot;The Waltons&quot;, premiered on the 14th September 1972 against tough competition from such favourites as the then popular Flip Wilson Show. After a shaky start the series took off in the ratings and stayed in prime time for an amazing 9 seasons which saw the setting move right through the depression years and then into World War 2 and beyond. Obviously over that period of time many changes occured in the series and unfortunately the second half of &quot;The Waltons&quot;, run was plagued by cast changes that ultimately damaged the show. First veteran Ellen Corby (Grandma) suffered a stroke, Richard Thomas (John Boy) left to do other projects, Will Geer (Grandpa) died of a heart attack, and Michael Learned (Olivia) also left to do other acting work. Each departure affected the series and I always felt Michael Learned's departure in particular, removing the warm calming mother of the clan was the biggest disappointment and left a hole in the series.Season one however has all of those difficulties long in the future and these 24 episodes find all the actors settling into their characters that we soon grew to love and know so well. Season one contains some brilliant episodes for you to enjoy such as &quot;The Scholar&quot;, which won a writing Emmy award, the superb &quot;The Literary Man&quot;, and possibly best of all the heartwrenching two part episode &quot;The Easter Story&quot;, which provided Michael Learned with one of her best stories in the series when she is stricken by polio. The writing could always be relied upon to create an emotional story but it was the power and sheer believability of the acting talent involved that made &quot;The Waltons&quot;, such first class entertainment. Will Geer and Ellen Corby were born to play Zeb and Esther Walton the grandparents of the clan. Here were no sentimental oldies but two people who were described at the time as the &quot;most realistic elderly couple on television&quot;. Ralph Waite as John Walton and Michael Learned as his wife Olivia where acting legends that brought qualities of warmth, reason and sacrifice to their characters of the parents. Even the children were well cast with actors that looked like they could be living on Waltons Mountain. Central to all the action of course was Richard Thomas in his unforgettable role as eldest son John Boy through who's eyes the action each week unfolded.This DVD set has the complete and uncut episodes set in their correct order so you can follow the families development from the first episode that went to air.

These Walton episodes from the early 70's do just that. There are a few twilight scenes in the earliest episodes that are quite dark but other than that there ain't much to complain about in this 5 front and back dvd collection. John Ritter has an excellent guest appearance as a rookie fire and brimstone preacher who gets a huge dose of the Baldwin sisters' 'recipe' which later translates to a huge dose of humility. Miss Micheal Learned's Liv Walton comes down with polio in the 2 hour season finale which showcases some truly fine acting . Sissy Spacek gets a nice guest starring role as an unruly country vixen trying to get John Boy to become anti-John Boy. It doesn't work ! I would recommend this season whole heartedly to anyone.

Everyone in our family could identify with one of the characters in the show since there were Grandparents, a Mom and Dad and kids of all ages. This TV family had all the trials and tribulations of many real families. It was always interesting to see how everyone would resolve the daily conflicts that a normal family has. Siblings dealing with the difficulties of growing up and parents striving to teach their kids values that would last their entire lives.

Jones,"[6, 6]","I virtually grew up on shows like The Waltons &amp; House on the Prairie, so when I found the Waltons on the DVD shelf in Wal-Mart, I just had to pick it up. Sure, I had just about all of the episodes on video...which as I look at them on the shelf, consists of 4 very high stacks of tapes, with some episodeic cavidies, low grade copies and some edit mistakes by the television stations when they re-aired them recently. I was reluctant when I picked up the copy, not sure if they would be of a poor grade or not...but when I got them home...not only were they the full length versions (50 minutes in comparison to the 40 - 45 minutes...depending on the stations) but they came up crystal clear in both picture and sound.And I agree that the kids of today can still learn a few things from these episodes, while the adults can be equally as entertained and educated.Of course these weren't meant to have an educational value to them, but they have dealt with a lot of issues like dealing with those who are different, substance abuse and even relationships of one form or another, while still sticking to the eras that the show was to take place (going from the depression, to WWII to the progression years 1950's in the follow-up movies).While it is a long series to follow, it is well worth the investment.
