I always want to reach inside of the television and start choking him for the crazy things he does.  This season he pushed my buttons even more.  He decides to run for political office, of all things, with the express idea of going public about being a polygamous Mormon at his victory speech with his multiple wives and children beside him. ""You idiot,"" I scream at my TV, ""how can you be so stupid?!"" But this is Paxton's brilliance.  He has completely caught someone who is in the continuous, rapt thrall of obsessive religious belief. He is humorless, which is true of all zealots, because he never steps outside of its thrall for even a second.  It absolutely controls every aspect of his life.  He laments his early beginnings as a lost boy, thrown out of his outlaw Mormon compound, and mistakenly believes he has recovered from all of that.  He has never recovered from being raised at a cult religious encampment.  What he's done is try to transplant the cult to new soil, mainstream USA life. He plays the character as rather one dimensional and robotic because someone who is in a state of rapturous religious zeal IS one dimensional!The other characters revolve around him.  He is the head so what he says goes.  However, he has thrown three wives together, all of whom have his children.  They live and function as a unit. Like women everywhere who are cast into subordinate positions from which they can never emerge, they scheme around him. Oh boy, do they scheme. While he has his eye constantly on the prize, being united with heavenly father in paradise with this huge family, the wives jockey for position, power, and play all ends against the middle.  If they believe in the end destiny, that takes a very subordinate position to daily contention with the here and now.Then there is the true horror: when you take on multiple spouses, you take on multiple in-laws.  Just imagine having to cope with multiple sets of in-laws instead of just one set.  One absolutely needs religious zeal to take on that component of this lifestyle.",5,Big Love--Bill Paxton Is Simply Terrific,1268524800,"03 14, 2010",2010,2152,"['Bill', 'Paxton', 'polygamist', 'Mormon', 'series', 'driven', 'absolutely', 'crazy', 'four', 'seasons', 'always', 'want', 'reach', 'television', 'start', 'choking', 'crazy', 'things', 'season', 'pushed', 'buttons', 'even', 'more', 'run', 'political', 'office', 'things', 'express', 'idea', 'going', 'public', 'being', 'polygamous', 'Mormon', 'victory', 'speech', 'multiple', 'wives', 'children', 'idiot', 'scream', 'TV', 'how', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'stupid', 'Paxton', 'brilliance', 'completely', 'caught', 'someone', 'who', 'continuous', 'rapt', 'thrall', 'obsessive', 'religious', 'belief', 'humorless', 'true', 'zealots', 'never', 'steps', 'thrall', 'even', 'second', 'absolutely', 'aspect', 'life', 'early', 'beginnings', 'lost', 'boy', 'thrown', 'outlaw', 'Mormon', 'compound', 'mistakenly', 'recovered', 'never', 'recovered', 'being', 'raised', 'cult', 'religious', 'encampment', 'What', 'done', 'try', 'transplant', 'cult', 'new', 'soil', 'mainstream', 'USA', 'life', 'character', 'rather', 'one', 'dimensional', 'robotic', 'someone', 'who', 'state', 'rapturous', 'religious', 'zeal', 'one', 'dimensional', 'other', 'characters', 'revolve', 'head', 'so', 'what', 'However', 'thrown', 'three', 'wives', 'together', 'whom', 'have', 'children', 'live', 'function', 'unit', 'women', 'everywhere', 'who', 'are', 'cast', 'subordinate', 'positions', 'can', 'never', 'emerge', 'scheme', 'Oh', 'boy', 'do', 'scheme', 'eye', 'constantly', 'prize', 'being', 'united', 'heavenly', 'father', 'paradise', 'huge', 'family', 'wives', 'jockey', 'position', 'power', 'play', 'ends', 'middle', 'believe', 'end', 'destiny', 'very', 'subordinate', 'position', 'daily', 'contention', 'here', 'now.Then', 'true', 'horror', 'when', 'take', 'multiple', 'spouses', 'take', 'multiple', 'in-laws', 'Just', 'imagine', 'having', 'cope', 'multiple', 'sets', 'in-laws', 'instead', 'just', 'one', 'set', 'One', 'absolutely', 'religious', 'zeal', 'take', 'component', 'lifestyle']",Big Love: Season 4
1299827,AQKKQ6L7Q9YJS,B002ZCY82W,ChaCha,"[26, 37]","We all know Big Love isn't real.  It's HBO's version of what would happen if we took a polygamous family who appear to the world as a middle class, all American family, then thrust them into suburbia and see how they handle their dirty little secret.  This formula worked for the first 3 seasons.  Indeed, we had to suspend belief at times but there were always straws of realism that we could cling to plus the fact that it had humor, great story lines and a lot of heart.  Kiss that goodbye in Season 4.This time around the characters are put into the most untenable situations.  One of the central themes was Bill Hendrickson's decision to run for public office.  It made no sense considering what he and his family had to lose, and for me put the kibosh on what was once must see TV.  There was still plenty of material to work with, mostly dealing with their daily lives without having to resort to these ridiculous plots.  Big Love was always something I couldn't get enough of but this season was mostly viewed with glances to my watch to see how much longer I had to suffer through the drivel.There were however, a few highlights (very few), particularly the development of a burgeoning homosexual romance for Alby Grant, the maturing of Margene, and Nikki's growing realization of her own abusive upbringing.  For anyone who loves this show, it's a sad season indeed, one that will be watched but not with much pleasure.

1299832,AY12DBB0U420B,B002ZCY82W,Gary Peterson,"[14, 18]","My wife and I watched Seasons 1 and 2 of the Big Love Series. It was interesting programing in that the story depicted an unknown world and put it into a believable and interesting framework. It was like looking through a little window into a situation we've read about but had no first-hand knowledge. The acting, scenes and directing were all rather good. So, we watched Season 3.  Well, the first two seasons were just an introduction to polygamy. Season 3 built on that introductory base and the situations and personal interactions became more complicated and somewhat more interesting. Season 4 seemed a natural.In Season 4, the foursome becomes ever more unstable. One of the wives takes an outside job and becomes locally famous. Another wife takes an outside suitor. One of the grandparents gets involved in smuggling parrots from Mexico. The grandfather dies and is frozen. The husband runs for public office and ultimately outs himself as a polygamist. The husband also gets involved in an Indian gaming venture and all the related complications. And it goes on and on. The problem is the story gets to be more and more unbelievable as the program proceeds. Seasons 1 and 2 were believable and were much like a well-done, low-keyed documentary on polygamous life in Utah. Season 3 became a stretch of that situation and was filled with a host of side issues. Season 4 is such a big stretch that it defies credibility, and that's a problem. It's just pure unadulterated fiction, and not very good fiction at that. Don't get me wrong, it's a well done program and many people may love watching it. But, my initial attractions to Season 1 and 2 no longer apply and I have serious doubts that I would ever watch Series 5.Gary Peterson",3,"Somewhat Interesting, but Defies Credibility.",1291161600,"12 1, 2010",2010,1741,"['wife', 'watched', 'Seasons', '1', '2', 'Big', 'Love', 'Series', 'was', 'interesting', 'programing', 'story', 'depicted', 'unknown', 'world', 'put', 'believable', 'interesting', 'framework', 'was', 'looking', 'little', 'window', 'situation', ""'ve"", 'read', 'had', 'first-hand', 'knowledge', 'acting', 'scenes', 'directing', 'were', 'rather', 'good', 'So', 'watched', 'Season', '3', 'Well', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'were', 'just', 'introduction', 'polygamy', 'Season', '3', 'built', 'introductory', 'base', 'situations', 'personal', 'interactions', 'became', 'more', 'complicated', 'somewhat', 'more', 'interesting', 'Season', '4', 'seemed', 'natural.In', 'Season', '4', 'foursome', 'ever', 'more', 'unstable', 'One', 'wives', 'outside', 'job', 'locally', 'famous', 'wife', 'outside', 'suitor', 'One', 'grandparents', 'involved', 'smuggling', 'parrots', 'Mexico', 'grandfather', 'dies', 'frozen', 'husband', 'public', 'office', 'ultimately', 'polygamist', 'husband', 'also', 'involved', 'Indian', 'gaming', 'venture', 'related', 'complications', 'problem', 'story', 'be', 'more', 'more', 'unbelievable', 'program', 'proceeds', 'Seasons', '1', '2', 'were', 'believable', 'were', 'much', 'well-done', 'low-keyed', 'documentary', 'polygamous', 'life', 'Utah', 'Season', '3', 'became', 'stretch', 'situation', 'was', 'filled', 'host', 'side', 'issues', 'Season', '4', 'big', 'stretch', 'credibility', 'problem', 'just', 'pure', 'unadulterated', 'fiction', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'fiction', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'well', 'done', 'program', 'many', 'people', 'may', 'love', 'watching', 'initial', 'attractions', 'Season', '1', '2', 'no', 'longer', 'apply', 'have', 'serious', 'doubts', 'would', 'ever', 'watch', 'Series', '5.Gary', 'Peterson']",Big Love: Season 4
1299833,A12AR87A72L54S,B002ZCY82W,"G. Crook ""Waterloo tragic""","[0, 0]","HBO Series offer entertainment and a form of education on many levels.While I agree that the fourth series approaches a level of fantasy and black humour more concentrated than the other series,is itself of interest because many of the themes reach their furthest possible development before the assumed denouement and self searching of the fifth series.Firstly,from ancient times through the Niebelungiad and onwards through Greek tragedy to us via Shakespeare,we know that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Poor Bill!And that vanity,idealism and greed will also contribute to Bill's self destruction.We find the unusual[for an American series],general theme of the persecution of the minority by the majority and the attempt of the minority to establish its rights within a democratic system under which it cannot possibly prevail. An interesting idea.So when HBO shows Alby determined to 'purify'Juniper Creek's religion,he merely sets out do do what many authoritarian political and  extreme religious figures have done in personal anguish and inhuman hatred of their fellow human beings. [Eg Stalin and Hitler].Juniper Creek is any  religious idea corrupted by ambition, greed and madness.The directors have chosen the perfect fantasy.Poligamy,after all is a valid concept for a paternalistic society which promotes the breeding of children as its prime activity.It exists in The Old Testamnent and in various other countries of deep religious persuasion in Africa and The Middle East.But HBO asks how can it exist in a 'modern',educated society?The three wives,continully lie to Bill and themselves to maintain their'ideals' and their lifetsyles[ Nicki is a compulsive liar]What a mess!Sarah leaves Utah and the fight over polygamy.An entirely logical step for her in the Fourth Series.Bill should never have run for office.This is unrealistic,although his single minded'idealism' will come crashing down,I am sure.HBO shows us that no idea or ideal survives people,organisations,history, governments,bureaucracies or commercialism or the other pressures of life[like women's rights].The saddest part of Part Four is the revelation that the Casino has increased drug use and dealing in the reservation and that love has driven Alby into insanity.Finally,the  black humour of Part Four did much to relieve the political and religious hysteria.I screamed with laughter at the 'Mexico' episode with the Greenes'.

While shorter in terms of number of episodes compared to previous seasons of Big Love, Season Four is no less compulsively watchable. Bill's insatiably ambitious sense of purpose just keeps getting him in deeper and deeper, and of course the family dynamics surrounding him continue to grow more and more complex. There are a number of really heavy developments in this season, and a clear sense of trajectory building to the final episode. The great Sissy Spaced guest stars as a hard-to-read character, and this is still one of the best-cast, best-written, simply best shows ever filmed.
