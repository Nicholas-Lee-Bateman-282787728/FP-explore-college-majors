There are the only two characters that have any emotional depth and realness. Everyone else is one-dimensional and transparent. This is probably Ryan Gosling's weakest performance, he just stands there looking sexy...he adds nothing and then suddenly his character does a 180 and all of a sudden he's a good guy instead of a player? Guys don't usually change their bad boy ways that quickly! Steve Carell wasn't very relatable as well. Marisa Tomei tries too hard to be outrageous, it just comes off as bad acting.

Soon, however, Jacob himself begins to earnestly fall for Hannah, and both he and Cal must lean on each other for support through their tumultuous love lives.

1372885,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B003Y5H574,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 4]","I remember when the trailer for `Crazy, Stupid, Love' was released and the internet went abuzz because it looked so sweet and charming and adorable and just plain fun.  Then the reviews filtered in, mixed as they were, but general consensus was that the familiarity of the plot and likable nostalgic building of themes was enough to set this film apart and make it feel fresh and new despite recycling thoughts and sentiments from years past.I feel the same way.`Crazy, Stupid, Love', despite the obvious influx of sex jokes and promiscuous themes really is from another era.  The way in which the film is developed and the character's fleshed feels oddly nostalgic, as if it is from the golden age of romantic comedies and could have easily starred the likes of Cary Grant and Irene Dunne.  Instead, we get Steve Carell and Julianne Moore, and they serve as wonderful hosts for Dan Fogelman's story.  Here we have a story of Cal and Emily Weaver.  They have what appears to be a good marriage and nice life until Emily drops a bombshell with the words divorce and affair and Cal's life starts to spin out of control.  Alone and desperate, he is taken under the wing of Jacob Palmer, a dedicated Casanova who swoons and lays whoever he pleases and he makes it his mission to turn the uncoordinated and geekish Cal into a middle aged version of himself.  It works, sort of, but Cal cannot shake the idea that Emily is where he belongs.  Trouble also starts to brew for Jacob once he meets Hannah and starts to form feelings that go beyond his shallow bedroom eyes.  In fact, love looms over the entire Weaver clan as young Robbie tries his hand at wooing his babysitter who happens to be harboring a crush on Cal.It's complicated.With inspired performances by Carell, Moore, Gosling and Stone not to mention a slew of memorable supporting performances by Marisa Tomei and America's Next Top Model contestant Analeigh Tipton, `Crazy, Stupid, Love' is sharp, funny and charming.  It isn't perfect, but what film is these days (actually, there are a few).

1372886,A1LH7YTNTWP6MT,B003Y5H574,Andrew Furst,"[3, 3]","As some here have noted, this is almost a great movie.  But it's marred by far too much in the way of crude or simply stupid dialog or events.  The good: most of the interaction between the adults. Cal (Steve Carell) has had only one girlfriend ever (now his wife), whom he met early in high school.  When his marriage hits the skids, Cal has no idea what to do; so he basically hangs out at a bar to drink and complain about his life.  Enter Jacob (Ryan Gosling), a successful bar-scene ""player"" who tells Cal that he wants to help him ""reclaim his manhood"".  Most of the  interaction between Cal and Jacob, as well as their interaction with other adults, is very well done, and if the movie centered exclusively on this it would be worthy of a 5 star rating.  Now there are some parts of the movie where Jacob takes the ""manhood"" thing too far; this straddles the line between humor and poor taste but it doesn't badly harm the movie.  For the most part, the principal actors (Carell, Gosling, Moore, Stone) do an outstanding job; I mainly was interested in this because I enjoy Steve Carell's comic acting, but I must say that Ryan Gosling gives the standout performance here.  The one disappointment among the adults are some of the scenes with Marisa Tomei.  Not her fault, she's great, and still looks fantastic (she's in her late 40's).  But a lot of the lines she's given to say, too vulgar and juvenile for what many would view as a romantic comedy.  It's a shame that her talents are somewhat wasted here.  Kevin Bacon does a decent job, but it's a very small role.Unfortunately, the film tries to cover more bases than adult bar/dating-scene interaction, and a subplot involving Cal's son and babysitter is almost entirely creepy, vulgar, unrealistic, and is not what I would consider to be humorous.  So when the action moves away from the adults to the teenagers, this becomes a far lesser movie than it could have been.  Which is too bad, because the young actors playing those roles seem very talented, they just have bad material to work with.  There's one scene that Cal's son has with his mother's ""boyfriend"" (Kevin Bacon) that was well done, and a little of his dialog with Cal is fine too.  But other than that, pretty much every time the son does anything it's a cringe-inducing, vulgar embarrassment.  And not at all realistic; the son is supposed to be one of the smartest in his class, yet he's got a creepy, stalkerish obsession with his babysitter, and he freely and proudly states and/or implies all sorts of vulgarities to various authority figures, who do very little to discipline him.  It doesn't help that Cal's son is short and young-looking even for 13, and the object of his affection is quite a tall (17 year old) girl; this only heightens the creepiness quotient, as it looks more like a young boy relentlessly pursuing an adult woman than one teen being interested in another. And as the movie continues, the babysitter even seems to be caught up in some unrealistic, misguided actions herself (mainly involving nude photos, which are not actually seen by the viewer).  So if you have kids, better make sure they either don't watch the movie or else explain to them that these actions are not only unacceptable, but could make them a major embarrassment to their family and community, and in any event would not succeed as intended.The movie also breaks down toward the end, as perhaps the writer decided to throw in several silly, semi-slapstick, stock plot devices - in order to make this fit the Hollywood ""comedy forumula"".  [MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD]. Toward the end we have, in rapid succession: several misunderstandings, a big chase related to the misunderstandings, a bunch of people wanting to do violence to each other (because of the misunderstandings), punches being thrown around, the police arriving on the scene, etc.  Somehow, someone in Hollywood got the idea that violence is funny; it never is, nor should it be.  Then there's the Hollywood cliche' of things going terribly wrong, only to be redeemed by a ""great speech"" that makes everyone stand up and cheer.  Yet it's not a great speech here, not a great message or a great ending.  The speech and ending does not ring true to me (yes I realize it's a movie, but still, there has to be some believability), and only compounds the unrealistic vision of ""romance"" held by Cal's son.So why four stars?  This is a movie with generous 5 star portions marred by seriously bad/disturbing 1 star elements.  Average those out, and it's a solid 3 star movie.  However, because the good parts here are so strong, I'll assume that the viewer can do their best to ignore the bad parts.  The good parts are definitely worth seeing, so I'm adding a star to the average - to make it 4 stars.  Definitely see this if the main plot interests you, and try to delete the bad parts from your brain as you watch.",4,"Brilliant (at times), Vulgar & Stupid (at others)",1363305600,"03 15,

My husband and I watched it and we found it was so boring we could barely sit through it. I'm really disappointed because I have waited for this movie to come out for months :(Everyone knows what happens, Steve's wife leaves him because their marriage is falling apart and because she slept with someone else. Of course, AFTER they separate and Steve sleeps with someone, she's offended because apparently only Julianne is allowed to do that.All the kids in the movie were little nutcases who will probably spend time in jail at some point. I didn't find the son's obsessive relationship with the babysitter cute, nor did I find her sick obsession with Steve to be heartwarming, either. Besides that, it didn't really drive the plot, and it wasn't funny. So the point was...? Oh and the speech at the end was so ridiculously cheesy I felt uncomfortable watching it.The only time I laughed out loud was once during a line spoken by Ryan Gosling, but he was also an implausible character because of this sudden altruistic act where he decides to help Steve. Even the trailer showed a scene that sort of explained this (when they're in the bathroom and Steve asks for help) but the movie makes no such effort. Also, his story with Emma Stone was completely ridiculous. When is Hollywood going to stop telling the story of a cute girl who is just so different that she's able to reform a womanizing man without even realizing it? Oh, Hollywood, you are so in touch with real relationships, I applaud you.My husband and I are in our twenties so there's no issue that we didn't understand it or that it was too racy for us.

It brings the romantic comedy to a mature and modern age with wit, heartfelt humor and characters that are believable and superbly cast.  Steve Carell and Julianne Moore are excellent as a married couple on the rocks.  Marisa Tomei pops in with a role that makes one remember how talented she really is.  But for me the true strength and heart of the film comes from Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone.  Ryan Gosling gives a highly entertaining comedic performance that is so multi-dimensional it will certainly take viewers by surprise as his character goes through many changes.  And Emma Stone is also hilarious.  She is proving herself to be an added asset to any film and here her humor is performed with a new intelligence and maturity.  The film is 2 hours and the beauty and heart of the film unfolds slowly from the rather abrupt beginning to the poignant and superb ending.  This is a film for true romantics.  The laughs here come from identifying with the characters and their lives.  Many subplots blend together in perfect harmony.The blu ray presentation is quite remarkable.  The video is spot on with a clarity that truly pops.  Colors are vibrant and bright with flesh tones realistic and true.  The black/white ratio is excellent and the overall crispness of the picture is that one may not expect from a romantic comedy.  And the audio matches it.  Dialogue is strong and present with the surround speakers used perfectly for ambience and club scenes.  The overall presentation is a perfect example of blu ray at its best.I honestly loved this film.  I did not see it in the theater and after purchasing it here at Amazon have watched it 3 times already and each time it makes me laugh more while also touching me more with its heartfelt and realistic message.  And with each viewing I am struck again by how great Ryan Gosling is here.  Who knew he had such great comedic chops.

The other side story involves Emma Stone having her own romance which is a tacked on, unnecessary and uninteresting waste of movie time.Seriously, the teenage son having a romance with the babysitter was actually the most interesting part of the movie.  The only other interesting segment involves Steve Carell's character rocking the cradle with a woman he meets at a bar, and when Steve and Julianne Moore's character visit their sons teacher, surprise surprise- the woman from the bar was the teacher!  Keep in mind Steve Carell had no idea she was actually his sons teacher, and Julianne Moore didn't realize the two of them were involved (at least sexually).Other than the babysitter and the teenage son trying to impress her, I was totally bored with this one.  More romance than comedy is a recipe for failure.  I suppose the babysitter falling for Steve Carell was interesting, but was never developed enough to feel like you're watching an accomplished piece of movie writing.  Alright, I suppose the part when everything came to a head and the men were wrestling and fighting in the yard was good.  This is when the cat is finally out of the bag and the entire family finds out who's been having a relationship/affair with who.

You can tell this when Julianne Moore tells Steve Carrell, her husband of almost 25 years, that she wants a divorce. From there, the movie breaks off into parts, following Carrell as he hits the singles scene and fails miserably until being aided by hilarious ladies man Ryan Gosling. This movie is more about finding lost love again after losing it.Gosling spends weeks tutoring Carrell on how to pick up women, while his ex-wife is struggling with her own choice to break up her marriage by having an affair with a coworker played by Kevin Bacon. Meanwhile, Carrell and Moore's 13 year old son has a crush on his cute 17-year old baby sitter. She however, isn't returning his love, because she has a crush on an older man. Emma Stone plays a young law student about to pass the bar exam, and being wooed by a nerdy boyfriend (Josh Groban) and ignoring the advances of Gosling. Sounds complicated? Well its really quite simple as the movie follows how crazy and stupid love can be as the characters try and find their one true soul mate.The movie is really good because of the strong cast. Each plays their part perfectly and there are lot of laughs, especially at the few twists at the end. The climax at the 8th grade graduation could have been handled better, but overall I really liked this movie. The triangle between the babysitter, the older man and the kid had a few moments that I believed cross the line (issues involving sexting) but this is a movie for adults, so kids shouldn't be seeing it anyway.As Steve Carrell moves past his successful stint on THE OFFICE, I hope he will make more movies like this.",5,Another five star review for this romantic hit,1313193600,"08 13, 2011",2011,1755,"['Looks', ""'m"", 'just', 'several', 'give', 'romantic', 'comedy', '5-stars', 'Crazy', 'Stupid', 'Love', ""n't"", 'traditional', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'can', 'tell', 'when', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'tells', 'Steve', 'Carrell', 'husband', 'almost', '25', 'years', 'divorce', 'there', 'movie', 'parts', 'following', 'Carrell', 'singles', 'scene', 'miserably', 'being', 'aided', 'hilarious', 'ladies', 'man', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'movie', 'more', 'finding', 'lost', 'love', 'again', 'losing', 'it.Gosling', 'spends', 'weeks', 'tutoring', 'Carrell', 'how', 'pick', 'up', 'women', 'ex-wife', 'struggling', 'own', 'choice', 'break', 'up', 'marriage', 'having', 'affair', 'coworker', 'played', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'Meanwhile', 'Carrell', 'Moore', '13', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'crush', 'cute', '17-year', 'old', 'baby', 'sitter', 'however', ""n't"", 'returning', 'love', 'crush', 'older', 'man', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'young', 'law', 'student', 'pass', 'bar', 'exam', 'being', 'wooed', 'nerdy', 'boyfriend', 'Josh', 'Groban', 'ignoring', 'advances', 'Gosling', 'Sounds', 'complicated', 'Well', 'really', 'quite', 'simple', 'movie', 'how', 'crazy', 'stupid', 'love', 'can', 'be', 'characters', 'try', 'find', 'one', 'true', 'soul', 'mate.The', 'movie', 'really', 'good', 'strong', 'cast', 'plays', 'part', 'perfectly', 'are', 'lot', 'laughs', 'especially', 'few', 'twists', 'end', 'climax', '8th', 'grade', 'graduation', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'handled', 'better', 'overall', 'really', 'liked', 'movie', 'triangle', 'babysitter', 'older', 'man', 'kid', 'had', 'few', 'moments', 'believed', 'cross', 'line', 'issues', 'involving', 'sexting', 'movie', 'adults', 'so', 'kids', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'seeing', 'anyway.As', 'Steve', 'Carrell', 'successful', 'stint', 'THE', 'OFFICE', 'hope', 'will', 'make', 'more', 'movies']",N/A

None of it sounded real. Zero. I'm also getting really tired of seeing middle-school aged children be the wise soothsayers, making all the adults nod sagely. I was creeped out by the borderline unnerving stalking of the son character of the babysitter, and the similarly creepy (and completely unbelievable) stalking her character did of the father. The single-mindedness the son had about the babysitter was entirely ridiculous. Doesn't the kid own an X-box?? Thirteen year old boys have the attention spans of gnats, and I would be a little weirded out if I was an adult around a kid who was that obsessed. The youngest daughter was a paper-thin throwaway character, mindlessly flitting around the movie, dancing like an autistic mental patient in her dad's new apartment, after her parent's marital separation. Oh, how funny! I'm surprised they didn't put her in an omnipresent tutu to really hammer home just how unaffected and breezy she is about--let me repeat it--her parent's marital separation. Was anyone else skeeved out seeing Steve Carell trying to get his groove on at a lounge catering to twenty-somethings, aka his daughter's age? Maybe this is commonplace in LA, but in the rest of the country, there's something really gross about it as well as tired. Barring the baffling attraction the rest of the country has for Ryan Gosling, as well as the boring one-note Emma Stone (who basically plays the same character over and over and over and over), I guess no other women who frequent the only bar apparently in town had any personality whatsoever. Kevin Bacon was supposed to be a reviled character, but I was like ""thank God, someone interesting"" every time he came onscreen.And then they had to hit us with the cheesiest technique ever, one I refer to as a film's ""Oh Captain my Captain"" moment--at a middle school graduation no less. We're supposed to believe that an audience there to see their own child graduate is going to be in thrall of a rambling speech about love, clapping along?

Ryan Gosling gives an Academy-Award winning performance as the lounge lizard who outdoes all lounge lizards. There are unexpected, politically incorrect, farcical moments, and at least one classic love scene that did something no other love scene I've ever seen has done. I laughed out loud and came close to crying.Emily (Julianne Moore) tells her husband, Cal (Steve Carell) that she wants a divorce. Cal begs his wife to ""stop talking."" When she keeps talking, he throws his body out of a moving car. As a woman who has tried to talk to men about serious issues, and been frustrated by their occasional inability to respond, I loved that scene.I thought I knew where this movie would go. The movie surprised me. Its biggest surprise was Ryan Gosling. Gosling has done nothing so far that made me look twice. ""The Notebook"" was one of the blandest and most forgettable movies I've ever seen, and his smaller movies tried too hard.Gosling's Jacob the Lounge Lizard is one of the funniest, sharpest, subtlest performances I've ever seen. In every smarmy smile, in every delivery of the hackneyed pickup line, ""Do you want to get out of here?"" Gosling performs a razor-edge between dead serious and flat-out parody. Jacob is both a big joke on bar bravado and an awed salute to masculinity. Gosling demands that we grant Jacob the due of an alpha male, as if he were a silverback gorilla - or Frank Sinatra - even while he invites us to laugh uproariously at him. He's Buddy Love on steroids. And, finally, we are invited to see poignancy and even some heartbreak. Even if I hated the surrounding film - and I did not - I'd watch this movie again and again just to see Gosling in it.Robbie (Jonah Bobo) has an unquenchable crush on his baby sitter. I kept waiting for the film to do something conventional with Robbie's love, but it never did - in fact it got a little weird - and I liked that. When I was that age, I was capable of that kind of love.There is a tangle of subplots that weave together into a beyond-chance farcical lawn party that made me laugh and cry at the same time. The audience watches characters have their hearts ripped out, their dreams and plans smashed - and yet has to laugh. What feels like death inside of participants' hearts looks like a screwball ballet to observers.""Crazy Stupid Love"" includes a quiet love scene that is worthy to become a screen classic. It involves two cell phones and a pilot light. This scene poignantly salutes what real, adult love really is, at its best.

It's not really a comedy; Steve Carell's character is more pathetic and maudlin then funny; Juliane Moore's character is well played but she is just not very likable; it's difficult to believe that she and Steve are a match made for life.There are a few gems here: Ryan Gosling is perfect as a cool narcissist with a thin veneer covering a vulnerable human being and there is a genuinely touching scene with his new found love when he begins to open that shell.Marisa Tomei is just over the top one-step-away-from-Fatal-Attraction-but-funny.  Liza Lapira is fantastic but under-utilized as the candid and raunchy-mouthed friend of Hannah, the soon-to-be attorney.The side plots are kind of Malcolm in the Middle uncomfortable, Cal's son having a meant-to-be-funny but kind of disturbing obsession with his babysitter, the babysitter having an equally disturbing obsession with Cal.

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[0, 0]","CRAZY, STUPID, LOVE is a dynamic and heartfelt comedy--a comedy with real laugh-out-loud moments and scenes where the viewers' heads are nodding because we've all felt the way the characters on screen are feeling.  It's warm, readily identifiable, poignant, substantially charming, and for the most part, totally believable.  It holds together and flows remarkably well--with an hysterical scene when four men go rogue--until it unravels during a surreal and bizarre junior high graduation.  And the air comes out of the balloon with a gaseous hiss, an ending this outstanding comedy doesn't deserve.Emily and Cal (Julianne Moore and Steve Carell) have been married over twenty years and look and act the part--until Emily announces she wants a divorce, as she's had an affair with a coworker (Kevin Bacon).  Stunned and confused, Cal is suddenly a middle-aged single man, practically wearing the 'D' word on his brow as he attends the local watering hole on a nightly basis, catching the attention of Jacob (Ryan Gosling), a suave babe magnet who effortlessly picks up any woman he wants, with no strings attached.  Jacob becomes Cal's wing man, teaching him how to dress, how to act, and particularly how to interact.  Although not nearly as successful as Jacob, Cal does periodically ""score"", particularly with perky Kate (Marisa Tomei), who, unbeknownst to both of them, is the teacher of Cal's 13-year-old son Robbie (Jonah Bobo).  Yet despite his conquests Cal feels strangely empty, and still drawn to Emily.  Meanwhile Robbie has a crush on Jessica (Analeigh Tipton), the babysitter, and if that's not complicated enough Jessica has a crush on Cal.  And the icing on this neopolitan cake is when ladies' man Jacob falls head over heels for Emily and Cal's elder daughter Hannah (Emma Stone); and the stage is set for some crazy, stupid comedy.Character actor John Caroll Lynch rounds out the main players as Jessica's father, with Lynch, Bacon, Gosling, and Carell in a tag team foursome that had me donkey braying with glee.  It's all grand fun until Robbie, his eighth grade class valedictorian, gives a grim, existential speech at junior high graduation, with Cal interrupting to wax philosophical on true love, with me squirming uncomfortably, wondering if screenwriter Dan Fogelman had suddenly lapsed into a Jack Daniels funk.  The only persons who might enjoy this scene are therapists, and based on the bizarre utterings there's plenty of work to be done here.  Thus CRAZY, STUPID, LOVE is good, often very good, in spite of an almost fatal ending.  I suggest you have some Jack yourself before tackling it.--D.

women are all indecisive, inept, or inappropriate. all the comedy in this movie is spun from those few principles.the wife asks for a divorce (indecisively) because she has (ineptly) slept with an office colleague. husband spins into childish despair (loud pity monologs in a bar), then (with infantile naivete) accepts demeaning advice (including face slaps) from a lady's man who is (childishly) acting on erotic impulses. through all this his barely teenage son believes in true love (childishly, and the way a stalker would understand it, as unrelenting harassment until successful possession) while the object of his love, the female babysitter, cannot have what she (inappropriately) wants -- the husband. the wife (indecisively) dates her lover but is (ineptly) ashamed of him in the presence of the babysitter; the lover (childishly) tolerates rebuke from the son. meanwhile the husband's adult age daughter, who has been (ineptly and inappropriately) smitten with a (childishly) vain and shallow lawyer, falls in love (inappropriately) with the lady's man, which causes the lady's man (in a childlike reversal of character) to believe in true love. the unraveling comes in a backyard free for all, launched in part by the babysitter (ineptly) leaving nude pictures of herself, addressed to the husband, where her parents can find them; mending comes in a high school speech where the husband (childishly) celebrates his simplistic emotional universe; the babysitter (inappropriately) gives the son those nude pictures of herself (how did she get them back from her parents?), and the last scene in the film is a cameo of the son, smirking with a knowing look at his parents, who may or may not repair the damage done by the wife's inept indecision and the husband's childlike simplicity.the three stars are entirely for the enjoyment of watching the performers perform -- even marissa tomei in an otherwise throwaway buffoon role as a high school teacher who (inappropriately) sleeps with a student's father and (ineptly) expects him to call her. carell, gosling and stone work well together, but the teenage son becomes annoying and the other roles (mostly female) are dispensable in their ineptness or indecision. this isn't a smart comedy (the characters are too clueless), and it isn't a dumb comedy (no pie in the face, no clowns with honking noses). it is a congenial comedy, a lite comedy, a canap&eacute; comedy. if you accept the first principles blithely, and don't mind some implausibly inappropriate, inept or childlike behavior on the part of adults in order to move the plot forward, then you'll probably enjoy it.",3,light and untethered,1391385600,"02 3, 2014",2014,2810,"['sometimes', 'useful', 'reduce', 'film', 'basic', 'premises', 'crazy', 'stupid', 'love', 'premises', 'are', 'men', 'are', 'fundamentally', 'little', 'boys', 'should', 'be', 'are', 'not', 'women', 'are', 'indecisive', 'inept', 'inappropriate', 'comedy', 'movie', 'spun', 'few', 'principles.the', 'wife', 'asks', 'divorce', 'indecisively', 'ineptly', 'slept', 'office', 'colleague', 'husband', 'childish', 'despair', 'loud', 'pity', 'monologs', 'bar', 'then', 'infantile', 'naivete', 'demeaning', 'advice', 'including', 'face', 'slaps', 'lady', 'man', 'who', 'childishly', 'acting', 'erotic', 'impulses', 'barely', 'teenage', 'son', 'true', 'love', 'childishly', 'way', 'stalker', 'would', 'understand', 'unrelenting', 'harassment', 'successful', 'possession', 'object', 'love', 'female', 'babysitter', 'can', 'not', 'have', 'what', 'inappropriately', 'husband', 'wife', 'indecisively', 'lover', 'ineptly', 'ashamed', 'presence', 'babysitter', 'lover', 'childishly', 'rebuke', 'son', 'husband', 'adult', 'age', 'daughter', 'who', 'been', 'ineptly', 'inappropriately', 'smitten', 'childishly', 'vain', 'shallow', 'lawyer', 'love', 'inappropriately', 'lady', 'man', 'lady', 'man', 'childlike', 'reversal', 'character', 'believe', 'true', 'love', 'unraveling', 'backyard', 'free', 'launched', 'part', 'babysitter', 'ineptly', 'leaving', 'nude', 'pictures', 'herself', 'addressed', 'husband', 'where', 'parents', 'can', 'find', 'mending', 'high', 'school', 'speech', 'where', 'husband', 'childishly', 'simplistic', 'emotional', 'universe', 'babysitter', 'inappropriately', 'son', 'nude', 'pictures', 'herself', 'how', 'did', 'get', 'back', 'parents', 'last', 'scene', 'film', 'cameo', 'son', 'smirking', 'knowing', 'look', 'parents', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'repair', 'damage', 'done', 'wife', 'inept', 'indecision', 'husband', 'childlike', 'simplicity.the', 'three', 'stars', 'are', 'entirely', 'enjoyment', 'watching', 'performers', 'perform', 'even', 'marissa', 'tomei', 'otherwise', 'throwaway', 'buffoon', 'role', 'high', 'school', 'teacher', 'who', 'inappropriately', 'student', 'father', 'ineptly', 'call', 'carell', 'gosling', 'stone', 'work', 'well', 'together', 'teenage', 'son', 'annoying', 'other', 'roles', 'mostly', 'female', 'are', 'dispensable', 'ineptness', 'indecision', ""n't"", 'smart', 'comedy', 'characters', 'are', 'too', 'clueless', ""n't"", 'dumb', 'comedy', 'pie', 'face', 'clowns', 'honking', 'noses', 'congenial', 'comedy', 'lite', 'comedy', 'canap', 'eacute', 'comedy', 'accept', 'first', 'principles', 'blithely', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'implausibly', 'inappropriate', 'inept', 'childlike', 'behavior', 'part', 'adults', 'order', 'move', 'plot', 'forward', 'then', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'enjoy']",N/A

Co-directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa and written by Dan Fogelman, this movie is overlong at 118 minutes and has contrivances galore, but it's also smart, shrewdly observed, and richly character-driven. These qualities override the flaws primarily due to a well-assembled cast that also includes Ryan Gosling, Julianne Moore, Emma Stone, and Marisa Tomei. Fogelman's screenplay punctuates big life lessons with clever scenes and ensemble set pieces that really snap and play like a Shakespearean roundelay.The plot centers on nebbish suburbanite Cal Weaver, who after two decades of seemingly content marriage, finds out his wife Emily has been unfaithful with her co-worker and wants a divorce. As the reality of his situation settles in, he moves from comatose to resentful to relentlessly morose at which point he has a chance meeting in a trendy bar with a self-confident womanizer named Jacob Palmer. Through reasons that go unexplained, Jacob decides to make Cal his pet project and make him over into a smooth-talking dating machine in an amusing montage that climaxes with a date with Kate, a jittery middle schoolteacher who turns out to be something of a nymphomaniac. Emily stumbles in her newly liberated state, while her and Cal's 13-year-old son Robbie grapples with a long-standing crush on his high-school-age babysitter Jessica who is smitten with someone substantially older. Meanwhile, Jacob goes through a transformation of his own as he falls for a sassy-smart young lawyer named Hannah who initially doesn't succumb to his fool-proof pick-up lines. All the characters intersect rather conveniently, and needless to say, complications ensue.Ficarra and Requa have a nice way of shaping Fogelman's dialogue into the pacing of the scenes, but they spend far too long in the middle of the story making the loose ends look more pronounced toward the end. Dexterous performances which effortlessly balance the comic and humane elements are essential to making the shenanigans work, and they're here in spades. Carell mines his character Cal in unexpected ways but doesn't lose his keen sense of comedy. As Jacob, Gosling is a nice surprise as he breezes through a role that could have been far more repellent had love not befuddled him so completely. Stone, currently Hollywood's ""It"" girl, nicely complements him as the acerbic Hannah, and their extended sequence at his elegant home is really well played by both actors. As Emily, Moore is the rare actress who can play a character who commits an unforgivable act and still can elicit viewer sympathy. Jonah Bobo plays Robbie with deadpan precociousness, while the too-thin Analeigh Tipton fluently brings out all the awkward gawkiness in Jessica. Tomei's turn as Kate is brief albeit a memorable one highlighted by a very funny classroom scene, while Kevin Bacon plays Emily's co-worker with his character's smarminess in check.

Is it just for lame laughs?""--- and a mercifully shorter downturn at the end than other comedies.  The plot managed to surprise me at times and made me laugh a lot more at the just plain funny moments than I had in a long time with a movie.While I could understand Julianne's character being conflicted and facing a mid-life crisis, at the same time, she was hard to like since wishy-washy is just plain hard to sympathise with no matter how justified.

1372959,A328S9RN3U5M68,B003Y5H574,Grady Harp,"[2, 3]","The title for this film is a solid choice: CRAZY, STUPID LOVE is. Thought he reviewers and the general public alike seem to rank this as one of the greatest films of the decade, for some other viewers this seems tired and trite and a faux showcase for some excellent actors to overcome a tawdry story. Writer Dan Fogelman (Cars, Cars 2,  Tangled,  Bolt, Fred Claus, etc) may be taking a step up form his previous work and that is a good sign, but when directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa have shown their sensitivity in the much maligned if not sadly ignored treasure 'I Love You, Philip Morris' it feels odd they should go for this script.Difficult to classify as a Romance or Comedy or Drama the film falls into the familiar category of a RomCom. Opening a film with an embarrassingly public announcement of a marriage dissolution over a wife's infidelity and dissatisfaction with her nerdy but good father/provider husband this story embraces about every situation about falling in and out of 'love' imaginable.  The idea of a monogamous clueless husband being 'changed' by a smooth talking, much bedded lothario isn't new nor is the 'finally met his match' idea fresh.  The manner in which the children of the couple respond with their own needs and damaged outlooks on relationships works OK, but the manner in which the in the process of divorcing couple work through their problems holds a mirror up to today's marriages.  The stories surround us in everyday life: the film merely magnifies them.It is always amazing when the marquee boasts the names of some of our more interesting actors as being involved: Julianne Moore, Ryan Gosling, Marisa Tomei, Kevin Bacon, et al deliver what they can.  The 'star' is Steve Carell according to the script, and you have to like the caricatures he creates to relate to him here.  There are some fine turns in cameos by Emma Stone, young Jonah Bobo, and Liz Lapira; when they are on screen the film lightens up. But in the end it is a two hour formulaic condensed television series type story.  And yet the Bravos form the audience must mean there is a craving for this type movie.

With Carell's comedy background, he makes the role very lovable and entertaining. Julianne Moore is a good actress, so she's able to portray the guilty wife pretty well.Gosling has already played bad boys pretty well, so this role is not a stretch for him. Nevertheless, he and Carell have great chemistry on screen.There's also a side story with Cal's kid in love with the teenage babysitter who has a very adult crush on Cal.Emma Stone also does good as Hannah, the girl about to be married to a guy who may or may be the one for her.All in all it's a nice little comedy.

True to its title, this movie examines the various crazy, stupid, and downright inexplicable aspects of love--and the love in this film flows freely: love lost between an endearing shlub (Steve Carrell) and his wife of 25 years (the always amazing Julianne Moore); love-as-lust as practiced by a hot young lothario (Ryan Gosling, perfectly cast); love avoided by an idealistic young lawyer-to-be (Emma Stone, in another role as the thinking man's hot chick); and unrequited love as only teenagers can experience it (Carrell's 13 year-old son, who just knows that his 17 year-old babysitter is his ""soulmate"" and said babysitter, who has a mad crush on Carrell). The plot here isn't the point anyway--except for one pitch-perfect scene in which Gosling and Stone lie in bed together and experience the true intimacy of really getting to know--and ""click"" with--another person. The plot twists might be a bit contrived, but this film has its heart in the right place.

A romantic comedy that is virtually laugh-free,  about a dull, straight-laced man (Carell) who, faced with divorce from his neglected wife (Juianne Moore) hooks up with a successful swinger (Ryan Gosling) who teaches him how to pick up women in a local bar. And that is the sum and substance of the film, which after over an hour of tedium and unconvincing situations, we suddenly have a deeply felt scene between the amazing Ryan Gosling and the equally interesting Emma Stone that seems to have wandered in from another film. Sadly, the feeling doesn't last, and the film loses its footing very quickly. There are several other subplots, and they all collide during the very frantic, not very funny penultimate scene, followed by a finale that features Carell and is squirm-inducing.For the record I had rented this film, and was so depressed when it was over, I watched ""The Americanization of Emily,"" the 1964 satire with the wonderful pairing of James Garner and Julie Andrews, written by the brilliant Paddy Chayefsky, and once again found it funny, touching and altogether brilliant...in other words, all the things that ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" is not.",2,"One great scene, not much else",1321056000,"11 12, 2011",2011,1322,"['confess', ""'m"", 'not', 'much', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'fan', 'approached', 'film', 'higher', 'expectations', 'overall', 'cast', 'generally', 'upbeat', 'reviews', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'virtually', 'laugh-free', 'dull', 'straight-laced', 'man', 'Carell', 'who', 'faced', 'divorce', 'neglected', 'wife', 'Juianne', 'Moore', 'up', 'successful', 'swinger', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'who', 'how', 'pick', 'up', 'women', 'local', 'bar', 'sum', 'substance', 'film', 'hour', 'tedium', 'unconvincing', 'situations', 'suddenly', 'have', 'deeply', 'felt', 'scene', 'amazing', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'equally', 'interesting', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'have', 'wandered', 'film', 'Sadly', 'feeling', ""n't"", 'last', 'film', 'footing', 'very', 'quickly', 'are', 'several', 'other', 'subplots', 'collide', 'very', 'frantic', 'not', 'very', 'funny', 'penultimate', 'scene', 'followed', 'finale', 'Carell', 'squirm-inducing.For', 'record', 'had', 'rented', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'depressed', 'when', 'was', 'watched', 'Americanization', 'Emily', '1964', 'satire', 'wonderful', 'pairing', 'James', 'Garner', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'written', 'brilliant', 'Paddy', 'Chayefsky', 'once', 'again', 'found', 'funny', 'touching', 'altogether', 'brilliant', 'other', 'words', 'things', 'Crazy', 'Stupid', 'Love', 'not']",N/A

I could have been like 40 year old virgin and had sexual things through out, or it could have been a romantic type movie like Dan in real life.  Luckily it was like the second.  In the movie Carells character is shocked to hear his wife wants a divorce.  In fact, it is all he can think about.  He goes to a club and talks about it day after day.  This is what catches the eye of a man who has no trouble getting ladies.  The mans name is Jacob.  He sees carells character moping and realizes he needs help.  So, he goes over to him and they become friends.  He tells him what he has to do in order to get more woman.  Be then just to sleep with, he wants to help him.  While this is going on, Carells son is in love with a girl who man be in love with his dad, while at the same time the man who is teaching Carells character how to play women may be about to fall in love with someone Carells character is close to!The movie was great.  It told you just enough about the characters for you to care what happened.  You wanted Carells character to be happy, but you probably will not be sure if you would rather him be with other women or his wife.  The story is kind of 60/40.  60% is about Carells character trying to figure out what love really is and means to him and the other 40% has to do with another girl and Jacob who is played by Ryan Gosling.  As I said earlier, the movie could have went on the sexual humor track and had things through out talking about sex and showing the men having sex.  But, as luck would have it they stayed away from that type of story.  This movie will make you laugh, feel sad and make you care about the characters.  Also, there are some romantic movies that try to make you feel sorry for or like one of the people in the couple more than the other.  I didn't feel that in this movie.  While Carell and his wife are apart, you never feel like either one really likes it.  You get the feeling that they themselves are wondering if it is the right thing to do.

1372998,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B003Y5H574,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[5, 6]","Crazy, Stupid, Love. is a sweet romantic-comedy about sweet people from Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, the duo behind last year's overlookedI Love You Phillip Morris. This is a film with genuine characters that follows the conventions of a Hollywood romantic-comedy but succeeds on the strengths of the well-written script by Dan Fogelman. Maturely written, it handles the romantic exploits of adults and children and puts equal emphasis on both. This is one of the few films of late that has a sub-plot about adolescent love that takes the character seriously rather than needlessly padding out the story. Emotions are allowed to naturally unfold instead of being dictated by what is required of the plot. This is written by someone who knows what he's doing and directed by two men who know how to lead their actors through the story to maximum effect.Cal Weaver (Steve Carell) is having dinner with his wife Emily (Julianne Moore) when she abruptly announces that she wants a divorce. Cal is stunned, especially by her admission that she has slept with her co-worker David Lindhagen (Kevin Bacon). Almost overnight, Cal moves into his own apartment and spends his nights moping at a local bar. Jacob Palmer (Ryan Gosling), a smooth-talking womanizer with a remarkable gift of getting beautiful women to accompany him home every night, sees Cal and offers to help him become irresistible to women. This comes after Jacob has just met Hannah (Emma Stone), whom he can't seem to shake from his mind. Meanwhile, Cal's 13-year-old son Robbie (Jonah Bobo) has fallen for his 17-year-old babysitter Jessica (Analeigh Tipton), who happens to harbor a crush on Cal. Parallel plot threads like this tend to bring trouble for writers, who tend to push one thread to the side in favor of another. Not here. Everyone is given equal attention and is fleshed-out appropriately. The way the plot threads eventually come together in a surprising and hilarious confrontation is easily one of the film's highlights.The characters are very believable and extremely likable. Crazy, Stupid, Love. is a comedy, but the humor comes from the way characters handle their emotions. The characters never seem to be consciously attempting humor and the film only rarely does. Directors Ficarra and Requa know comedy and actors, which is likely why both are so well utilized. There are some great actors, some well-known and some not, who appear to be enjoying themselves while perfectly capturing the essence of their characters.This is a film that gets far with a talented screenwriter and some talented directors, but the overall quality rests on the shoulders of the ensemble that bring the story to life and, for this film, they can't be overlooked or ignored. Carell is the everyman, cynical and hurt over his divorce. Gosling, who after massive success with The Notebook seemed to retreat from the mainstream for more personal roles, is so suave and electrifyingly charming, it's easy to accept some of the dialogue he gets away with. Stone, who seems to get better with every new film, has an uncanny ability to light up the screen and the chemistry she and Gosling share is absolutely smoldering. Marisa Tomei also has this light up the screen ability and still does even with a small role. Moore makes the adulterous Emily such a sympathetic character that it's impossible to harbor any ill-will towards her. Finally, for the third time in 2011, Kevin Bacon appears as the ""bad guy,"" David Lindhagen, a sweet man who feels guilt about his role in the dissolution of a marriage but also feels strongly about Emily. I question whether Bacon is intent on playing every variation of a villain he can. Even the younger actors do good work and the sub-plot about Robbie trying to woo Jessica is convincingly written and poignantly acted.Crazy, Stupid, Love. does not alter the foundation of Hollywood romantic-comedies, but even at its most formulaic, it's done right. It maintains such a positive tone that even Robbie's graduation, the film's most generic scene, is warm and adorable. The film is equal amounts comedy and drama, but the genre elements blend splendidly to create a surprisingly wonderful movie. It's not a great film, but it works so well that there's very little to criticize. It's just so...sweet.GRADE: A-",5,"A Total Surprise - Sweet and Funny, With a Great Cast",1312070400,"07 31, 2011",2011,4302,"['Crazy', 'Stupid', 'Love', 'sweet', 'romantic-comedy', 'sweet', 'people', 'Glenn', 'Ficarra', 'John', 'Requa', 'duo', 'last', 'year', 'overlookedI', 'Love', 'Phillip', 'Morris', 'film', 'genuine', 'characters', 'conventions', 'Hollywood', 'romantic-comedy', 'strengths', 'well-written', 'script', 'Dan', 'Fogelman', 'Maturely', 'written', 'romantic', 'exploits', 'adults', 'children', 'equal', 'emphasis', 'one', 'few', 'films', 'late', 'sub-plot', 'adolescent', 'love', 'character', 'seriously', 'rather', 'needlessly', 'padding', 'out', 'story', 'Emotions', 'are', 'allowed', 'naturally', 'unfold', 'instead', 'being', 'dictated', 'what', 'required', 'plot', 'written', 'someone', 'who', 'what', 'doing', 'directed', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'know', 'how', 'lead', 'actors', 'story', 'maximum', 'effect.Cal', 'Weaver', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'having', 'dinner', 'wife', 'Emily', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'when', 'abruptly', 'divorce', 'Cal', 'stunned', 'especially', 'admission', 'slept', 'co-worker', 'David', 'Lindhagen', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'Almost', 'overnight', 'Cal', 'own', 'apartment', 'nights', 'moping', 'local', 'bar', 'Jacob', 'Palmer', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'smooth-talking', 'womanizer', 'remarkable', 'gift', 'getting', 'beautiful', 'women', 'accompany', 'home', 'night', 'Cal', 'help', 'become', 'irresistible', 'women', 'Jacob', 'just', 'met', 'Hannah', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'whom', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'shake', 'mind', 'Meanwhile', 'Cal', '13-year-old', 'son', 'Robbie', 'Jonah', 'Bobo', 'fallen', '17-year-old', 'babysitter', 'Jessica', 'Analeigh', 'Tipton', 'who', 'harbor', 'crush', 'Cal', 'Parallel', 'plot', 'threads', 'tend', 'bring', 'trouble', 'writers', 'who', 'tend', 'push', 'one', 'thread', 'side', 'favor', 'Not', 'here', 'Everyone', 'given', 'equal', 'attention', 'fleshed-out', 'appropriately', 'way', 'plot', 'threads', 'eventually', 'come', 'together', 'surprising', 'hilarious', 'confrontation', 'easily', 'one', 'film', 'highlights.The', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'believable', 'extremely', 'likable', 'Crazy', 'Stupid', 'Love', 'comedy', 'humor', 'way', 'characters', 'handle', 'emotions', 'characters', 'never', 'seem', 'be', 'consciously', 'attempting', 'humor', 'film', 'only', 'rarely', 'Directors', 'Ficarra', 'Requa', 'know', 'comedy', 'actors', 'likely', 'why', 'are', 'so', 'well', 'utilized', 'are', 'great', 'actors', 'well-known', 'not', 'who', 'appear', 'be', 'enjoying', 'perfectly', 'capturing', 'essence', 'characters.This', 'film', 'far', 'talented', 'screenwriter', 'talented', 'directors', 'overall', 'quality', 'rests', 'shoulders', 'ensemble', 'bring', 'story', 'life', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'overlooked', 'ignored', 'Carell', 'everyman', 'cynical', 'hurt', 'divorce', 'Gosling', 'who', 'massive', 'success', 'Notebook', 'seemed', 'retreat', 'mainstream', 'more', 'personal', 'roles', 'so', 'suave', 'electrifyingly', 'charming', 'easy', 'accept', 'dialogue', 'away', 'Stone', 'who', 'get', 'better', 'new', 'film', 'uncanny', 'ability', 'light', 'up', 'screen', 'chemistry', 'Gosling', 'share', 'absolutely', 'smoldering', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'also', 'light', 'up', 'screen', 'ability', 'still', 'even', 'small', 'role', 'Moore', 'adulterous', 'Emily', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'impossible', 'harbor', 'ill-will', 'towards', 'Finally', 'third', 'time', '2011', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'bad', 'guy', 'David', 'Lindhagen', 'sweet', 'man', 'who', 'guilt', 'role', 'dissolution', 'marriage', 'also', 'strongly', 'Emily', 'question', 'Bacon', 'intent', 'playing', 'variation', 'villain', 'can', 'Even', 'younger', 'actors', 'do', 'good', 'work', 'sub-plot', 'Robbie', 'trying', 'woo', 'Jessica', 'convincingly', 'written', 'poignantly', 'acted.Crazy', 'Stupid', 'Love', 'not', 'alter', 'foundation', 'Hollywood', 'romantic-comedies', 'even', 'most', 'formulaic', 'done', 'right', 'positive', 'tone', 'even', 'Robbie', 'graduation', 'film', 'most', 'generic', 'scene', 'warm', 'adorable', 'film', 'equal', 'amounts', 'comedy', 'drama', 'genre', 'elements', 'blend', 'splendidly', 'create', 'surprisingly', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'so', 'well', 'very', 'little', 'criticize', 'just', 'so', 'sweet.GRADE', 'A-']",N/A

Seeing boring and Steve Carell in the same sentence is not something you see everyday. He has a proven track record of enjoyable movies such as The 40 Year Old Virgin, Over The Hedge, Little Miss Sunshine, Dan In Real Life, Get Smart, Evan Almighty, Horton Hears A Who!, Despicable Me, and Dinner For Schmucks. I was expecting this movie to be on that same level. But it failed to accomplish that. The speech during the graduation by Cal (Carell) seemed forced and awkward. Other than that, Carell's performance wasn't bad. But his best dramedy character is Dan Burns in the movie Dan In Real Life. Julianne Moore's character is easily forgettable. For a memorable Julianne Moore character, check out Freedomland. Emma Stone is also a forgettable character here. Ryan Goseling is the latest one to strike while the iron is hot, being in 3 awful or easy to forget movies that came out in 2011. Those movies being this, Drive, and The Ides Of March. Goseling gets somewhat of a pass because he's in Remember The Titans and I like that movie. I love Marissa Tomei and I was disappointed that her role was a bit part. She's clearly the stand out character of this movie. Kevin Bacon as the romantic antagonist David Lindhagen, is rather light weight. He's not sinister enough in his role. The whole boy and baby sitter subplot was really awkward and creepy. His public displays of love were way over the top, the babysitter's crush on Cal is creepy, the pics the babysitter sends Cal are creepy, and the boy's speech is very unrealistic. And to ask the same question another reviewer asked: why does a 13 year old need a baby sitter? I could see him needing a baby sitter if he were 10. But not at 13.

1373007,A1RN5Q2NPT6ISB,B003Y5H574,"Kate Smart ""Private""","[26, 49]","This movie features a stellar cast of accomplished actors, but I found it incredibly disappointing. The script is terrible, and there is a whole sub-plot involving a character's son that should have been deleted. And the ending reminded me of an ABC After School Special: Groan-worthy; the kid standing at the podium in the school gym, and dear-old-dad grabs the mike and starts blithering on about how much he loves his wife. Hollywood loves the public display of emotion, as if it somehow holds more weight becuase there is an audience.The problem is this film doesn't know what it wants to be: if it's a fantasy/comedy, then it should not try to pull at your heartstrings at the same time. That would require a decent script and a certain amount of realism. Divorces are not done in 1 day, there are issues around money/custody, etc. that need to be worked out, etc. That none of this happens - instead, we see the supposedly brokenhearted husband hanging out in the bar - made me not care about the characters. It is just a silly plot; middle-aged man receives dating advice from super-cool younger guy. Husband works in an office cubicle but somehow makes enough money to buy a massively expensive new wardrobe and pay for bar tabs that amount to $800. It was just dumb, not believable at all.

The dialogue is just clever without trying to be too cute or hip, and both Steve Carrell and Ryan Gosling put in a stellar performance.

1373011,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B003Y5H574,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 2]","In theory and on paper, ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" had the potential to be a disaster. It seems sometimes that studios have lost the ability to replicate anything resembling real life in the big budget fiascos that stand for romantic comedy these days. Do people really have to act like complete morons to find true love? How many uptight career women do we need to watch being tamed by adolescent and boorish men? While Dan Fogelman's screenplay certainly plays to the expected conventions, it is distinguished by a smart and genuine sense of humor that is grounded in identifiable and likable character types. It has a surprisingly hard edge which is quite refreshing. Incorporating adult themes, ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" is a romantic comedy that you don't have to be embarrassed to like for it doesn't pander or insult your intelligence. Yes, it goes a little soft in the final act for my taste--but up to that point, the experience is rich, thoughtful and filled with laughs. And there are some super actors at the top of their game--which certainly doesn't hurt.The movie begins with the dissolution of a marriage. Steve Carell and Julianne Moore, as Cal and Emily Weaver, face the unpleasant truth about Moore's infidelity as she pushes for a separation. The resultant scenes have a bitter truthfulness which plays out in the most awkwardly humorous (and slightly disturbing)way. Much of the movie has Carell reeling and trying to make sense of his life. Ryan Gosling, as the neighborhood lothario, takes the unrepentant sadsack under his wing for some tutelage about making time with the ladies. Yes, it is formulaic in an only-in-the-movies kind of way--but both actors are so engaging, it's quite easy to overlook the convenience of plotting. Gosling, meanwhile, may have met his match with the spirited Emma Stone. These two share real sparks that intensify and deepen as the movie delves further into their bond. Not to be left out, there are several others involved in the romantic merry-go-round including Carell's son who is in love with the babysitter who in turn is in love with Carell. The movie twists around on itself, serving up surprises and sweetness. It all may be a bit gooey by the end, but the performers will keep you on your toes.Despite being a romantic comedy for grown-ups, perhaps the film's biggest (and most valuable couple) are Carell and Gosling. When these two are together, the picture soars. It is easily one of Carell's best roles and Gosling can do no apparent wrong (is he in every 2011 release?). Stone is quite winning. I also enjoyed brief but pivotal roles by Marisa Tomei and Kevin Bacon who cross paths with the central married couple. Even with the many subplots and peripheral characters, the film is focused and confidant. What is so amazing is that the picture feels fresh and new despite working squarely in familiar territory. Relatable and more real than it has any right to be, ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" makes me yearn for other studio comedies to risk engaging both a viewer's heart and his brain. Give it a shot if you're looking for an adult film filled with big laughs, much heart, and one of the year's most adept ensemble casts. About 4 1/2 stars, I'll round up for the central bromance!

The writing is sharp, and the cast is excellent. It centers around Julianne Moore and Steve Carroll as a long-married couple for whom the flame has died. She has a brief affair and asks for a divorce, and this plunges Carroll's character (Cal) into his own search for a new persona. Ryan Gosling is fantastic as a younger womanizer who tutors Steve Carroll in seduction, but then is himself changed by a relationship with Emma Stone's character.The movie is somewhat predictable, although it does have some twists that surprised me. It gets a little cliche in the way it resolves everything in the end, but I didn't mind that because the by then I was invested in the characters.

Power ""nlp trainer""","[73, 89]","As comedies go, I think this is probably one of the better ones you will see this year.Steve Carell plays Cal, a husband who splits from his high school sweetheart, played by Julianne Moore, after she cheats.  Hanging out in single bars every nights he sees this ladies man played by Ryan Gosling successfully pick up numerous women, while he says out loud to anyone who will listen, 'my wife cheated on me with xxxx.'Meanwhile his teenage son has the hots for his babysitter, while the babysitter crushes on Cal. We have 4 romantic triangles between the main characters, that are developed to great comic effect.So, Ryan Gosling's character takes him under his wing, as his wing man, and shows him how to score with the ladies, which leads to many interesting twists and turns.There were several parts of this movie that made me cringe, one was the patheticness of the character played by Steve Carell.  The teenage crush made me cringe a little, especially with the absurd things this kid did to get her attention.In fairness this was more than balanced with some high quality scenes and interactions, particularly the scenes with Marisa Tomei, who I thought was absolutely brilliant, especially when her simmering emotions boil over at the parent teacher meeting.The Dirty Dancing routine between  Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone was simply movie magic, and one of the best scenes I have seen all year, two quality actors, chemistry, everything, perfect.I have a sneaking suspicion that Ryan Gosling may be one the best actors on the planet.  You probably know him from The Notebook, a perennial top 100 rental on leading dvd rental sites.  He has studously avoided the mainstream doing indie and art house movies.  Watching his performance inBlue Valentinewith Michelle Williams convinced me of his greatness, with some reminders of a young DeNiro, without the psychotic overtones, or even perhaps Sean Penn, the most respected actor among his peers.The proof may not be out there yet, and I am so glad to see him to see him in a mainstream movie.  I hope that he will continue to make critically acclaimed movies and also more widely seen movies, and that he will get both the recognition, and ultimately the accolades he deserves.Emma Stone, what can you say, she is the best of the young actresses who has emerged over the last two years, outstanding inEasy A, and now the lead in The Help, for which she may get an Oscar nom.I hope this was helpful, and I think the movie is worth seeing.",4,A swing and a miss.

And like Bradley Cooper about six months ago - everyone wants Ryan. And I mean everyone. And on the strength of ""Drive"", ""The Ides Of March"" and this - it's easy to see why. Women are drooling over him - and guys want to be his drinking buddy.Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling play Cal Weaver and Jacob Palmer - two polar-opposites in the cool stakes. Cal has only ever had one woman and wife - the beautiful but slightly wayward Emily (Julianne Moore). Jacob has had more women in an hour that politicians have had billable brunches. His prey is sophisticated but loose business types that frequent the bar Jacob hangs out in - women with the corporate finesse of a piranha that hasn't eaten in a week. When Cal stumbles into an ill-advised divorce because of one mistake on the part of Emily - he enters Jacob's world - and with advice that appeals to a man's ego - enters into way too many easy lays. His journey back to his true love makes up the rest of the movie...Clearly relishing the witty and smartly written script  - the two wildly different male leads spar off each other very convincingly. Julianne Moore is her usual classy self as always (such a great actress). There's even a tremendously clever and funny pairing of young love in the 13-year old Robbie (Cal's son) who is besotted with his 17-year old babysitter Jessica (great work by both Jonah Bobo and Analeigh Tipton). On the bumbling adult front - Kevin Bacon and Marisa Tomei bump up the cringe and laugh count too.But for me it's the fabulous Emma Stone who brings the whole macho proceedings to life - and like her breakthrough performance in ""Easy A"" - she injects some badly needed reality into the picture. Her character's bubbly nature is infectious and her palatable vulnerability fills her love scenes with Gosling with a sense of danger and thrill. Stone's Hannah wants her heart fulfilled - not used - not shattered by some smarmy barfly out to chalk up another notch on the headboard of his waterbed. Stone's Hannah is nervous, giddy, talkative, loving, trusting - she gives Hannah a 'this-is-how-a-real-woman-is' set of reactions - and the movie is so much the better for it - warm even.""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" is not pretending to be ""War And Peace"" - but it's a hugely enjoyable romp when those sort of things seem to be in short supply these days. Besides - it passed the ultimate litmus test - my missus and teenage daughter gobbled up every moment of it and could not be tempted away - even by morsels of Cadbury's Twirl...Do my girls want to discover the true meaning of love? Find out the joys of marital bliss? Bath in the wisdom of enlightened relationships? Do they bo**ox! They want to lick strawberry Haagen Daz off the Gozzer's rippling abs and YouTube the experience afterwards to make all their friends jealous.

Jacob makes it his mission to get Cal back in the dating scene.Meanwhile, there's a girl who brings out a new side of Jacob that makes him awkward. He begins to feel like he's in a real relationship.Carell saves this movie as he does with every film he's in. There are some truly awesome comedy moments in this game, but they are always marred by taking the crude humor/language too far.A case-in-point is at the cliched ""speech"" moment at the end of the film. It could have ended with the cheese but the son just has to add one more sentence which pretty much ruined it.This is not exactly a romantic comedy in the traditional sense. Yes, it deals with the foibles of romance and fleeting love but it also touches on some darker aspects of married love that looks to have failed.I was surprised with the twist in this film.

1373041,A1H9EF4S5I9OKX,B003Y5H574,M. Bullions,"[5, 7]","Let me start off my review of this film by saying that I hate Steve Carrell. Watching him on ""The Office"" for all those years was painful, because his character, and it seemed his acting style was unbelievably stupid and bland. While he has occasionally been a decent funnyman, I hadn't seen him in a role where he was remotely interesting and believable.Yesterday, I was at the movies, pretty much the whole day, and decided to check out ""Crazy Stupid Love"", because it had decent critical and audience reactions, better than I expected for a romantic comedy, and it had some of my favorite people in it, including Julianne Moore, Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. And, to say the least, I was caught by surprise.One of the reasons for this, is because ""Crazy Stupid Love"" works as a romantic comedy and a drama. Most romantic comedies, I find, are predictable, stale, and essentially one carbon copy after another, of the same exact story, played out in a slightly altered way. You probably won't guess where ""Crazy Stupid Love"" is going. While the ending itself is alot like I predicted it, there's a big plot twist that presents itself in the climax that I really didn't see coming. And that's reason enough to see this movie.However, there are many (better) reasons. One of the big reasons is that it avoids making any of its characters caricatures. Each character is real, and flawed, screwed up and deals with his or her problems in a very grounded and grown-up way.It revolves around Cal (Carell), a man who has been married to Emily (Moore) for 25 years, and is rocked by the revelation that she wants a divorce, after sleeping with a co-worker (Kevin Bacon). Cal begins hanging out at a chic pickup bar, where he meets Jacob (Ryan Gosling), a lothario who takes a different woman home every night. He picks up on Cal's depression, and helps him turn into something of a womanizer. Meanwhile, Cal's floppy-haired thirteen-year-old son Robbie has a crush on his older babysitter, who has a little crush of her own. Also, Jacob meets Hannah (Emma Stone), a young lawyer who has heard every pickup line, and therefore, has a quite jaded outlook on love.And it is the first film or TV show to portray Steve Carrell as a human being. He can act! Who knew? I actually liked him in this role, because I felt that he wasn't Michael Scott, or that guy from ""Get Smart"", or ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"", but an average guy whose life didn't turn out as he had hoped. I bought him in this role. He more than keeps up with the rest of the film's stellar cast.Another revelation here is Ryan Gosling. I've mostly seen him in depressing dramatic roles (""Blue Valentine"", ""The Notebook""), while here, he proves himself to be a cunning comedian. He has spectacular comedic timing, and clearly has a lot of fun here with the other actors. He seems to be the superficial funnyman at first, and, like the rest of the cast in this terrific film, opens up, and surprises the audience.While Julianne Moore is always great, her character and Carrell's character mesh in a way that makes you believe that their marriage lasted 20+ years. Emma Stone is on fire right now, doing a great role in ""The Help"", she shines just as much here, if not more. Her character is instantly lovable, and I can't wait to see what she does next.This film also features Marisa Tomei, who gives a fierce, and very funny performance as a recovering alcoholic schoolteacher who dates Cal for awhile after his divorce. Kevin Bacon also made me laugh, as Emily's co-worker, who was her post-divorce rebound. While these two have brief roles, they are very funny and make the most of what they are given.What makes this film memorable for me, is that it is realistic. It doesn't paint love out to be this magical thing that will automatically make anyone happy. It knows that love doesn't always work out, and occasionally ends in heartbreak and/or violence. And while it's somewhat a cautionary tale, it ends hopefully and overall, kind of happily. It made me cry a little, and it made me laugh a lot.

Enter a player (played by Ryan Gosling of THE NOTEBOOK) at a club the husband attends who takes pity on him and teaches him how to get it on with attractive women. There are clearly some good laughs in this film but it has a lot to say about not only gender roles but also how the genders treat each other in the courtship/mating phases. There's clearly a theme running through this film that the man has to toil to make the woman happy and that sometimes he'll be happy as well and other times he will not. It would also seem that if a single man cheats with a married woman that it's okay to punch said single guy but not the married woman who had a vow going yet she's a woman so you can't do that. A true love theme also permeates the movie but what puts this film up a few notches in comparison to other romantic comedies are the overlapping subplots. The player falls in love near the end of the picture, the 13 year old son is already in love with the babysitter but she loves somebody else and, well, you get the idea. Women will love the ""dance"" scene with Gosling and Stone. Supporing roles by Marisa Tomei, Kevin Bacon, Emma Stone and John Carroll Lynch (Norm from FARGO).  The ending sort of dumbed itself down to what people wanted to hear and detracted from some of the unanswered questions of love and how it sometimes makes us do stupid things and also how people who love each other in a marriage don't always work things out. Anyway, the sappy ending detracted from the overall tale and sold out. If not for that the story part of the film would have been higher. The budget for this film was roughly $50M and it made over $142M at the Box Office.

At this point, Cal isn't really interested in why Emily (Julianne Moore) cheated.  After all, they've been together since middle school and have never been with anyone else.  Cal decides to get back out there (there being where he's never been) and bumps into Jacob (Ryan Gosling), a playa' of the first magnitude.  Jacob agrees to coach Cal and eventually he has some success.  But Cal is never comfortable in the role of seducer-in-chief.  He's still in love with his wife.This is only one relationship interwoven in this nice romantic dramedy.  Jacob, not looking for anything other than nooky, finds a girl (Emma Stone) who 'can' resist him.  Naturally, he's more interested.  Then we have Cal and Emily's 13 year old son who has a major crush on his 17 year old babysitter, who in turn has a crush on Cal.  And of course there's Emily trying to figure out if there's anything of value between her and her work romance with David (Kevin Bacon) other than ""banging"" (Cal's favorite word).What appears to be complicated, in reality comes across very clear as the film unwinds. The directors (Glenn Ficarra, John Requa) do a good job walking the fine line between raunchy comedy, heartfelt romance and eventually a true love story.  It is also a rare movie that has a twist at the end that caught me by surprise.1-11-12 - Blu ray update:  The transfer is 2.40:1 and excellent detail, solid blacks and good skin color.

1373082,A3V61K0EF38GP4,B003Y5H574,Philip Scholz,"[0, 1]","This film hit the ground running...seriously, we were immersed in its main plot within about twenty seconds.  I'm just fine with that.  It gave us more time to enjoy that, and it was time mostly well spent.  The cast was all great and properly chosen for their respective roles, something that doesn't always happen.  Though I am wondering a few things...does Steve Carell play the middle-aged man whose life is falling apart a bit too convincingly?  Is it weird that Ryan Gosling has just as much chemistry with Steve Carell as he does with Emma Stone?  Seriously, they're all at their best when at least two out of three of them share a scene.  Julianne Moore was great as a woman who was unsure about what she wanted out of life, though I sometimes felt she didn't have enough to do in this film and was just there because the role was needed for the plot.  Same goes for Kevin Bacon, who played the new man in her life.  The opposite goes for Marisa Tomei, playing a school teacher who meets up with Steve Carell's character after his wife leaves him.  She was lively, energetic, and had plenty to do...she just didn't have enough scenes to do it in.  Meanwhile, The interactions between Jonah Bobo and Analeigh Tipton were amusing, though I wonder if any thirteen-year-old boy would be that honest, even to the girl he's majorly crushing on.  Nevertheless, I really liked the ending to their subplot...I'm sure the look on the kid's face was priceless.Okay, now as to why, despite my praise for this film, I only gave it four stars.  Well, there are two glaring problems that Hollywood just needs to be made aware of so they can learn from their mistakes.  Number one...while I stand behind my earlier very positive opinion of the entire cast, some of the ways they all come together seem a bit too contrived.  I don't want to give anything away but a suspension of disbelief is required at multiple points in the plot.  Despite that criticism, I did find the multi-confrontational get-together in the backyard very amusing and Ryan Gosling had the best confrontation of them all when he defended Steve Carell.  My second problem is the kid's graduation speech at the end...my problem is so glaring that I want those forty or so seconds of my life back!  It was corny, weird, awkward (that's saying something for this kid), and I just didn't like it or the audience's ultimate reaction.  Also, a huge suspension of disbelief would be required as the school would have surely screened for something like that, especially since it's the 8th grade and considering everything that's already happened with this kid.  From the way he recited the speech, he'd obviously written something down and rehearsed it, so where were the teachers on that one.

I had no idea when I started watching it, that it would turn out to be so good.  Plus they snunk a cute love story in there when I wasn't looking! What was up with that! :)The story follows a middle aged man, during the crisis and aftermath of his marriage falling apart, and how he picks up the pieces to try and build and new life that includes dating.  He gets hooked by a real ladies man, younger guy, who ends up showing him ""the ropes"" so to speak on how to talk to women, helps him with a make-over, etc.It was a unique story, that had me totally buying on the homely attitude of the main character.  I felt for him, and wanted to see him get his life back, rise again from the ashes of emotional despair.  And the young ladies man's character, was perfect, just the right amount of honesty and supportive to kick the main character's butt into gear.  Their relationship turns from a mentoring position, to more of friendship, and then back to a mentoring relationship when their roles switch towards the end.Really good cast, fun and believable characters, cute dialogue that had me laughing, and overall a really good story where you see the character's grow and evolve, with a twist of ending!",4,"Tea: Yes, I dug the flavor",1361577600,"02 23, 2013",2013,1291,"['Overall', 'movie', 'really', 'surprised', 'depth', 'story', 'romance', 'comedy', 'had', 'idea', 'when', 'started', 'watching', 'would', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'so', 'good', 'snunk', 'cute', 'love', 'story', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'looking', 'What', 'was', 'up', 'story', 'middle', 'aged', 'man', 'crisis', 'aftermath', 'marriage', 'falling', 'apart', 'how', 'up', 'pieces', 'try', 'build', 'new', 'life', 'dating', 'hooked', 'real', 'ladies', 'man', 'younger', 'guy', 'who', 'up', 'showing', 'ropes', 'so', 'speak', 'how', 'talk', 'women', 'make-over', 'etc.It', 'was', 'unique', 'story', 'had', 'totally', 'buying', 'homely', 'attitude', 'main', 'character', 'felt', 'wanted', 'see', 'get', 'life', 'back', 'rise', 'again', 'ashes', 'emotional', 'despair', 'young', 'ladies', 'man', 'character', 'was', 'perfect', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'honesty', 'supportive', 'kick', 'main', 'character', 'butt', 'gear', 'relationship', 'mentoring', 'position', 'more', 'friendship', 'then', 'back', 'mentoring', 'relationship', 'when', 'roles', 'switch', 'end.Really', 'good', 'cast', 'fun', 'believable', 'characters', 'cute', 'dialogue', 'had', 'laughing', 'overall', 'really', 'good', 'story', 'where', 'see', 'character', 'grow', 'evolve', 'twist', 'ending']",N/A

The latter is the case with ""Crazy Stupid Love"".A romantic comedy as you might expect. Steve Carell and Julianne Moore sit in a restaurant after a large meal. They were married right out of high school, always together, now with three kids. They say, ""I can't decide what I want. Let's say what we want on the count of three, one, two three."" Carell says ""Cr&egrave;me Brule""; Moore says ""I want a divorce"". That sets the stage for what comes next. Moore wants more. She is cheating on him with Kevin Bacon's character.Carell gets kicked out of his home, no wife and children. Drunk in a bar he bemoans his fate to anyone listening, he says he is a ""cuckold"", he bemoans the fact that women don't like him. The young stud womanizer Ryan Gosling hears this raving, feels sorry, offers him a fashion makeover and his favorite stud pickup lines to help him with women. I will not give away more plot but the movie is well worth your time, with lots of commentary on current relationship etiquette.There is a great scene where Carell's date, played by Marisa Tomei, stands on top of a table in a short blue dress and four inch spike heels and proceeds to do a wild, drunken belly flop on top of Carell (see box cover). Pretty, wide blue-eyed Emma Stone plays a smart young lawyer who has heard all the pickup lines. Carell's tween son as a crush on his teen babysitter who is a head taller than him.Emma Stone has come out of nowhere to have three movies out at the same time, this one, ""The Help"" and a bit part in ""Friends with Benefits""! Pretty, attractive and an actress I predict great things from her. She was the high school temptress in the movie ""Easy A"" .The revelation here is Carell, he can act! He has played a buffoon in ""The Office"" for years, he slows great depth and emotional sensitivity here.. Very funny situations and touching!.Amidst all the plethera of predictable super-hero movies this summer, this is a breath of fresh air.

1373106,A73QPH7NGI0DJ,B003Y5H574,Sean Curley,"[1, 1]","Has any genre fallen further into formulaic drivel than the studio romantic comedy?  Hollywood churns these out, year and after year, becoming less and less distinct as they go along.  The romantic comedy has consumed more potentially promising young actresses than I care to count (remember the late 1990s, when Jennifer Lopez was hot off ""Selena"" and ""Out of Sight"" and looked to be a young actress worth following?).  ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" comes from co-directors Glen Ficarra and John Requa, previously responsible for the entertainingly oddball Jim Carrey film ""I Love You Phillip Morris"" (seen by not nearly enough people, incidentally), who, while not exactly breaking all the conventions, are making a determined effort to do things differently.  The result is a big success, and I imagine that, much like their previous film, it will not attract nearly the initial audience that it deserves.  I can't recall a studio romantic comedy in recent times that has entertained me as much as this one.  Spoilers follow.""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" falls into a largely discontinued subgenre, the 'comedy of remarriage' - it fell out of style with the explosion of the divorce rate (or actually before that), but was very popular in the age of screwball comedy (""The Philadelphia Story"", for instance).  We open with Cal (Steve Carell, playing it fairly straight) and Emily (Julianne Moore, who I used to think couldn't do comedy very well, but she's done a few recently that worked), married for 25 years when Emily blurts out that she has had an affair and wants a divorce.  Cal grants this with unseemly equanimity, and settles into the life of a bitter divorcee hanging out in a bar and regaling everyone with his story.  This eventually prompts the intervention of Jacob (Ryan Gosling, straying outside the indie drama for the first time in a while), a ladies man who vows to help Cal recover his masculinity.  Cal gets a makeover, and tries his hand at womanizing, starting with Kate (Marisa Tomei).  Jacob, meanwhile, is flirting with articling law student Hannah (rising star Emma Stone, enjoyable as always).  And Cal and Emily's only son, 13-year-old Robbie (Jonah Bobo), has a crush on the sitter, 17-year-old Jessica (Analeigh Tipton), who in turn secretly crushes on Cal.The handling of the ensemble cast is not completely perfect; some of the supporting characters go away for decent stretches of the running time (Jessica, especially).  Marisa Tomei and Kevin Bacon, as the married couple's significant flings, are both underused, especially Bacon.  However, there's a wonderful depth to things.  Carell and Moore have lovely chemistry as a couple that has been together for a quarter-century and is now at odds (Moore has played the cheating spouse a number of times in the last few years, I must say).  Ryan Gosling is marvelous as the somewhat caddish Jacob, and plays very well off both Carell and Stone.  The kids are also well-done, with Tipton making a believably awkward teenage girl.  Tomei, for all her limited screentime, has a lot of the most purely comedic stuff in the script, and does very well with it.  While there is the aforementioned issue of juggling all the characters, the script is otherwise very smart, and incorporates a number of surprise reveals that are almost impossible to guess while also playing very fair with the audience (the big one near the end is, on reflection, really well-done; I had earlier thought that it seemed odd that a couple married for 25 years had a 13-year-old as their eldest child).Highly recommended.

The story of a divorced man trying to get his mojo back by being trained by a lady's man to get over his blocks and score does have a great deal of potential.

There are too many coincidences that are supposedly whacky. Marisa Tomei has a funny freakout scene but it doesn't feel real or genuine. The same goes with Steve Carell's breakdown scenes that provide shorthand for ""character going through crisis"" but should be used to signify ""character who needs to be hospitalized.""However, the most egregious problem with the movie was the subplot in which the 13-year old son stalks his babysitter with creepy text messages and awful declarations of love.

The fact that his ""love sucks"" speech gets interrupted by a terrible scene in which another character gets to declare undying love in one of those speeches that can only be applauded in the movies (but are awful).

The inciting incident comes up quite quickly: Wife Emily Weaver (Julianne Moore) announces she wants out of her 25 year marriage to husband Cal (Steve Carrell), after revealing that she's been having an affair with a colleague at work. It's a poorly written scene as Cal meekly acquiesces to Emily's demand and we never really find out why she's so dissatisfied in the first place.After some rather long-winded scenes where Cal drowns his sorrows in drink at a local bar, bemoaning his fate as a marriage castaway, he finally meets Jacob Palmer (Ryan Gosling) and we break into the second act of the story. Jacob is a womanizer, a 'player' of great skill, if you will, who takes pity on Cal and decides to teach him how to pick up women. This is perhaps the best and most amusing part of the movie where Jacob first picks out a new wardrobe for Cal and then orders him to watch him in action, as he seduces women step-by-step. At first Cal is resistant but soon learns how to imitate Jacob's every line and he ends up bedding nine women, one of whom happens to be Kate, the public school teacher of Cal's son Robbie, played by Marisa Tomei. Unfortunately, Kate is one of Tomei's least likable roles in awhile, as she is an over the top nymphomaniac, who ends up continually giving Cal the finger later in the story, for bedding her and then leaving her high and dry.Meanwhile, other ditsy complications accrue. Robbie becomes obsessed with he and his sister's babysitter, Jessica, who in turn develops a crush on Cal. There's a rather unfunny bit where Jessica, upon the advice of a seductive high school student rival, takes nude pictures of herself with the plan of sending them to Cal, only to have them fall, way too easily, into the hands of her hot head father. Even worse is the obnoxious infatuation that festers in Robbie throughout the film. How much can an audience take of a 13 year old's creepy obsession that only abates at just about the final scene of the movie?'Crazy, Stupid, Love' becomes a lot less 'crazy' in the second half, more stupid and pours on the 'love', a little too thick. It seems that the cool Jacob character turns into a cream puff when he falls for Hannah, who happens to be the adult daughter of Emily and Cal. There are virtually no clues (except for Cal's reference early in the narrative, to 'Nana', Hannah's childhood appellation), so the big 'twist' feels forced and unearned, on the part of the film's scenarists. Now the tables are turned and Jacob is turning to Cal for 'advice' on how to handle relationships. Cal's insecurity and goofiness is a now a badge of honor, as he can show Jacob how to 'be himself'.While Cal wants to cut off all ties with Jacob, now that he's fallen for his daughter, it doesn't take long before an extra dose of 'love', becomes the more prominent moniker in 'Crazy, Stupid, Love'. Yes, Cal soon sees the light and is willing to embrace ex-bad boy Jacob, as his new, potential son-in-law. He interrupts Robbie's speech as Salutatorian of the school, who is in the middle of a put down about true love, due to his rejection by Jessica. Cal recounts his courtship of Emily, affirming his love for her. After the graduation ceremony, Cal hands Robbie the nude photos of Jessica, as his 'consolation prize'. Robbie agrees to call off his stalking of Jessica, by shaking her hand and promising to look her up only once he finally begins to look more like his Dad in a few years. As if we couldn't predict it, Cal and Emily are seen reminiscing about the events of the past year and the implication is of course, that they soon will be back together.Even more disappointing than the transformation of bad boy Jacob into into a virtual milquetoast, Julianne Moore is saddled with the weakest role in the film. We learn little about Emily throughout the film--and the pseudo-romantic subplot involving the dull office colleague, David Lindhagen (Kevin Bacon), proves to be a subplot that goes nowhere.'Crazy, Stupid, Love' is occasionally amusing, especially when Carrell and Gosling face off in the first half. But by the denouement, we're back in the realm of the predictable, and even worse: an egregious, sentimental, happy-ending.

The couple has two children living at home, sometimes minded by cute babysitter Jessica (played by Analeigh Tipton,) who has an unrequited crush on Cal. Cal and Emily's thirteen year-old son Robbie (Johan Bobo), in turn, has an unrequited crush on older woman (four years older, to be exact) Jessica.The most difficult circumstance of this breakup, at least from my point of view, is that fact that Cal and Emily have been together since the tender age of fifteen--making the now ousted Cal seem incredibly vulnerable and helpless now that he is out on his own for the first time in his life.  Without any experience in meeting women beyond having asked young Emily out for an ice cream cone twenty some years ago, poor Cal is completely adrift without a clue where to begin this new phase of his personal life.  An unlikely Good Samaritan comes to his aid, however, in the person of Ryan Gosling's Jacob, a lady's man who takes it upon himself to remake Cal in his own image.  With Jacob's help, Cal soon finds himself bedding one babe after another, including a woman (played by the always appealing Marisa Tomei) who he later (and embarrassingly) discovers to be his son's teacher!The various love polygons left in the wake of Cal's newfound persona and romantic conquests adds to the dilemma that he still loves his estranged wife and would dearly wish to return to his pre-breakup life--as evidenced by the secret nocturnal gardening that he indulges in around his old house.

The premise that there is always a soul mate for each of us and the fact we need to fight for who we love, isn't exactly the reality of the 21st century.It's the story of a man dealing with a wife going through her own mid-life questioning, which is sort of the opposite of most situations.  Usually, it's the man dumping the wife because of his illicit affair or need to look elsewhere.  Why she strayed to begin with isn't delved into deeply.  You sort of never see it coming either, just like the husband, Cal.However, shocked and broken over the revelation, he heads to the bar he's passed many times and bemoans his unfaithful wife who wants a divorce.  He meets the womanizing man, who is going to turn him into a man his wife will want back.  The tables are turned.  He's the one who has let himself go, and suddenly he's turned into a well-dressed dude ready and able to woo the women in the bar like his teacher.Of course, he still loves his wife, who struggles with her decision.  One child goes through struggles of adolescence and divorce, while the other dances through apparently unscathed.  And a side story brews over another young girl, who surprisingly is related to Cal in a level you've never guessed.The theme of soul mates and fighting for love seem cliche in this day and age.  It's a notion that has passed on by, as well as fighting for a marriage on the brink of divorce.  If we were all truly soul mates, would we fight to keep it together?  If you haven't married your soul mate, is your marriage doomed?  The theme is idealistic; but reality is much different.A few laughs are here and there.  A lot of sap is in the message.  It was a mildly entertaining, but irritating as well if you've suffered through adultery, divorce, and themes that are contrary to the movie's message.  Let's be honest.

There are just too many opportunities for films of this nature to go astray, from acting to story to ridiculousness.  Fortunately, ""Crazy Stupid Love"" doesn't fall prey to those traps and instead provides a tight, stylish, funny, and even moving production that appeals to a broad range of movie-watchers.For a basic plot summary, ""Crazy Stupid Love"" sees a middle-aged couple (played by Steve Carell & Julianne Moore) get a sudden divorce, shaking their family to the core.  Concurrently, a suave love-guru (Ryan Gosling) takes Carell's sad-sack character and tries to turn him into a ladies man, all the while pursuing a mysterious, fresh-faced girl (Emma Watson) who is unlike any girl he has met before.The calling-card of this flick is its ability to carry multiple plotlines over the duration of the film until they all converge in the end.  There is never a shortage of things going on, all related to the central concept of the ""craziness of love"".The acting has to be great for a movie like this to succeed, and that is exactly what we get here.  While all the actors are impressive in their own right, it's their chemistry that really shines here.  By the end, all of the major players have interacted with each other, and it all comes off seamlessly.The ""polish"" of this film is also impressive.  Everything is just so slick, from the dialogue to the clothing and especially the young cast members (Gosling & Stone, in particular).  In short, this movie lacks nothing in the production-value department.Overall, then, ""Crazy Stupid Love"" is a film that can be enjoyed by teens on up for a variety of different reasons.  I watched primarily for Carell's acting, but was quickly drawn in by the innocent beauty of Stone and the slickness of Gosling.  I'm sure you'll find a reason to be sucked in as well.",5,Strong In Every Area,1325980800,"01 8, 2012",2012,1866,"['Usually', ""'m"", 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'rom-com', 'genre', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'many', 'opportunities', 'films', 'nature', 'go', 'astray', 'acting', 'story', 'ridiculousness', 'Fortunately', 'Crazy', 'Stupid', 'Love', ""n't"", 'fall', 'prey', 'traps', 'instead', 'tight', 'stylish', 'funny', 'even', 'moving', 'production', 'appeals', 'broad', 'range', 'movie-watchers.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Crazy', 'Stupid', 'Love', 'middle-aged', 'couple', 'played', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'get', 'sudden', 'divorce', 'shaking', 'family', 'core', 'Concurrently', 'suave', 'love-guru', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'Carell', 'sad-sack', 'character', 'tries', 'turn', 'ladies', 'man', 'while', 'pursuing', 'mysterious', 'fresh-faced', 'girl', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'who', 'girl', 'met', 'calling-card', 'flick', 'ability', 'carry', 'multiple', 'plotlines', 'duration', 'film', 'converge', 'end', 'never', 'shortage', 'things', 'going', 'related', 'central', 'concept', 'craziness', 'love', '.The', 'acting', 'be', 'great', 'movie', 'succeed', 'exactly', 'what', 'get', 'here', 'actors', 'are', 'impressive', 'own', 'right', 'chemistry', 'really', 'shines', 'here', 'end', 'major', 'players', 'have', 'interacted', 'other', 'off', 'seamlessly.The', 'polish', 'film', 'also', 'impressive', 'Everything', 'just', 'so', 'slick', 'dialogue', 'clothing', 'especially', 'young', 'cast', 'members', 'Gosling', 'Stone', 'particular', 'short', 'movie', 'nothing', 'production-value', 'department.Overall', 'then', 'Crazy', 'Stupid', 'Love', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'teens', 'variety', 'different', 'reasons', 'watched', 'primarily', 'Carell', 'acting', 'was', 'quickly', 'drawn', 'innocent', 'beauty', 'Stone', 'slickness', 'Gosling', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'find', 'reason', 'be', 'sucked', 'as', 'well']",N/A
