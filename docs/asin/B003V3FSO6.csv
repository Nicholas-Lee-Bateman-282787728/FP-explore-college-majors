The movie is about true events which occured in an Amish community several years ago and was reported by the national media. The movie brings the people and event to life more than a news story ever did. It gives each of us a challenge from God behind the scenes to put into place in everyday living. A tragic shooting takes place at their school and the Amish forgive the murderer and assist his family. One parent struggles with the premise of forgiveness among all the Amish, her journey is shown and how God works a miracle in her life.The movie is a great reminder to forgive others.

1366581,A2AMRY5HTD7YZE,B003V3FSO6,ChickenSoup,"[0, 1]","I bought this movie on Amazon instant video.  The good thing about instant video is that you don't have to worry about your disc being scratched or damaged, or it being lost.  You'll always have access to it (unless Amazon goes out of business or something like that, which I don't anticipate, at least not anytime soon).  The only bad thing about video streaming (on Amazon anyway) is that you don't have any of the disc options.  There is no subtitle option, no bonus features, you just get the movie.  I suppose it's not a big deal for a made-for-TV movie like this; but what about the collectibles?  Like the I Love Lucy discs - I mean, you can stream the episodes, but you wouldn't be able to access the extra bonus materials that people crave for classics like Lucy... anyway, I digress.Okay, the movie itself was kind of cheesy.  I cried anyway, but the only reason why I cried was because of the thought of those little girls being killed - and I knew that it was based on actual events, so I had already read up on the shooting and seen the news footage of it prior to this movie, so it was already an emotional topic for me anyway.  The tears had nothing to do with good acting.  The reason why I say that this movie is &#34;cheesy&#34; is because no one really embraced their roles.  I had the feeling that this movie was thrown together in about a week or so.  For example, no one had an Amish accent - now, I don't know if anyone has ever been in Lancaster County, PA - but even if you haven't, and you've had contact with other Amish people in other areas (like the Midwest for example), you know that they speak with a heavy accent.  They also speak Pennsylvania German (also called PA Dutch), English is a second language to them.  I mean, these actors didn't even attempt to fake an Amish accent, except for Ida here and there - and it wasn't very good faking either.That was my main problem with this movie, it didn't seem authentic, mainly what was lacking was the accents.",3,It's Okay,1358985600,"01 24, 2013",2013,1992,"['bought', 'movie', 'Amazon', 'instant', 'video', 'good', 'thing', 'instant', 'video', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'worry', 'disc', 'being', 'scratched', 'damaged', 'being', 'lost', ""'ll"", 'always', 'have', 'access', 'Amazon', 'business', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'anticipate', 'least', 'not', 'anytime', 'soon', 'only', 'bad', 'thing', 'video', 'streaming', 'Amazon', 'anyway', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'disc', 'options', 'subtitle', 'option', 'bonus', 'just', 'get', 'movie', 'suppose', 'not', 'big', 'deal', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'what', 'collectibles', 'Love', 'Lucy', 'discs', 'mean', 'can', 'stream', 'episodes', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'access', 'extra', 'bonus', 'materials', 'people', 'crave', 'classics', 'Lucy', 'anyway', 'digress.Okay', 'movie', 'was', 'kind', 'cheesy', 'cried', 'anyway', 'only', 'reason', 'why', 'cried', 'was', 'thought', 'little', 'girls', 'being', 'killed', 'knew', 'was', 'based', 'actual', 'events', 'had', 'already', 'read', 'up', 'shooting', 'seen', 'news', 'footage', 'movie', 'was', 'already', 'emotional', 'topic', 'anyway', 'tears', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'good', 'acting', 'reason', 'why', 'say', 'movie', '34', 'cheesy', '34', 'one', 'really', 'embraced', 'roles', 'had', 'feeling', 'movie', 'was', 'thrown', 'together', 'about', 'week', 'so', 'example', 'one', 'had', 'Amish', 'accent', 'now', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anyone', 'ever', 'been', 'Lancaster', 'County', 'PA', 'even', 'have', ""n't"", ""'ve"", 'had', 'contact', 'other', 'Amish', 'people', 'other', 'areas', 'Midwest', 'example', 'know', 'speak', 'heavy', 'accent', 'also', 'speak', 'Pennsylvania', 'German', 'also', 'called', 'PA', 'Dutch', 'English', 'second', 'language', 'mean', 'actors', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'attempt', 'fake', 'Amish', 'accent', 'Ida', 'here', 'there', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'faking', 'either.That', 'was', 'main', 'problem', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'authentic', 'mainly', 'what', 'was', 'lacking', 'was', 'accents']",Amish Grace

AMISH GRACE is a powerful story -- both tragic and inspiring.  The acting, screenplay & directing are excellent and, in my opinion, as good or better than in many major film productions. The story is set in the Amish community in Lancaster County, the heart of Pennsylvania Dutch Country.Kimberly Williams-Paisley & Tammy Blanchard give strong performances as bereaved women who struggle mightily to cope with their own personal tragedies.  Williams-Paisley portrays the grief-stricken Amish mother of a 14-year old daughter who is gunned down by a deranged shooter in a small Amish schoolhouse.  Blanchard plays the role of the wife of the killer who discovers too late her husband's heinous plot.Although the film is based on an incident that occurred in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania a few years ago, it is not a docudrama. Rather it focuses more on the tragic and traumatic effects of the killings on one of the Amish families and on the family (mostly the wife) of the shooter. The interplay of the 2 main characters and their contrasting families illustrate one of the major themes of the film, the profound, paradoxical impact of forgiveness.The Amish family itself is divided in its efforts to cope with the outrageous killing of one of their daughters.  Williams-Paisley convincingly portrays the intense gamut of emotions, such as grief, hatred and outrage that any mother would feel. Her reactions sharply conflict with those of her husband, who anguishes (mostly in private) over his own suffering and the extraordinary effort required to genuinely forgive the killer in Christ-like fashion.The other family (referred to by the Amish as the ""English,"" a term referring to those outside of their faith community) experiences the shock, shame and blame for the despicable killings while trying to comprehend the actions and loss of their seemingly normal husband and father. Blanchard shines in her role as the grieving, shame-filled wife, mother and daughter-in-law.All of these strands of the story mesh gracefully to provide a thought-provoking drama that is neither blatantly preachy nor overly simplistic as it deals with complex moral and social issues.",4,The Power & Difficulties of Forgiveness,1286928000,"10 13, 2010",2010,2240,"['like', 'dramas', 'pack', 'emotional', 'punch', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'one', 'AMISH', 'GRACE', 'powerful', 'story', 'tragic', 'inspiring', 'acting', 'screenplay', 'directing', 'are', 'excellent', 'opinion', 'good', 'better', 'many', 'major', 'film', 'productions', 'story', 'set', 'Amish', 'community', 'Lancaster', 'County', 'heart', 'Pennsylvania', 'Dutch', 'Country.Kimberly', 'Williams-Paisley', 'Tammy', 'Blanchard', 'give', 'strong', 'performances', 'bereaved', 'women', 'who', 'struggle', 'mightily', 'cope', 'own', 'personal', 'tragedies', 'Williams-Paisley', 'grief-stricken', 'Amish', 'mother', '14-year', 'old', 'daughter', 'who', 'gunned', 'down', 'deranged', 'shooter', 'small', 'Amish', 'schoolhouse', 'Blanchard', 'role', 'wife', 'killer', 'who', 'too', 'late', 'husband', 'heinous', 'film', 'based', 'incident', 'occurred', 'Lancaster', 'County', 'Pennsylvania', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'not', 'docudrama', 'more', 'tragic', 'traumatic', 'effects', 'killings', 'one', 'Amish', 'families', 'family', 'mostly', 'wife', 'shooter', 'interplay', '2', 'main', 'characters', 'contrasting', 'families', 'illustrate', 'one', 'major', 'themes', 'film', 'profound', 'paradoxical', 'impact', 'forgiveness.The', 'Amish', 'family', 'divided', 'efforts', 'cope', 'outrageous', 'killing', 'one', 'daughters', 'Williams-Paisley', 'convincingly', 'intense', 'gamut', 'emotions', 'such', 'grief', 'hatred', 'outrage', 'mother', 'would', 'feel', 'reactions', 'sharply', 'conflict', 'husband', 'who', 'mostly', 'private', 'own', 'suffering', 'extraordinary', 'effort', 'required', 'genuinely', 'forgive', 'killer', 'Christ-like', 'fashion.The', 'other', 'family', 'referred', 'Amish', 'English', 'term', 'referring', 'faith', 'community', 'shock', 'shame', 'blame', 'despicable', 'killings', 'trying', 'comprehend', 'actions', 'loss', 'seemingly', 'normal', 'husband', 'father', 'Blanchard', 'role', 'grieving', 'shame-filled', 'wife', 'mother', 'daughter-in-law.All', 'strands', 'story', 'mesh', 'gracefully', 'provide', 'thought-provoking', 'drama', 'blatantly', 'preachy', 'overly', 'simplistic', 'complex', 'moral', 'social', 'issues']",Amish Grace

It's also about how one religious community struggled to obey the command of Jesus to forgive those who wrong us.In a deeper sense, however, it explores exactly what forgiveness is.  The Amish realize something that most of us don't.  They know that harboring hatred and anger in our hearts hurts no one but ourselves.  This is a truth that spiritual leaders through the millennia have spoken of, yet it is also one that is generally ignored among people of faith.  We long for God to strike out and destroy those we call sinners, while we forget that the vitriol we display in doing so ultimately poisons our own souls.I was so impressed with this movie that I bought a copy to screen at our church in September.

For sure there will be a tremendous amount of pain, anguish and emotional turmoil.In this picture, which is based on a true story, it shows the struggles of a mother, when one of her two daughters is killed by a disturbed man (who commits suicide after slaying 5 Amish girls).This is not the regular fast paced CG-loaded movie, rather it rolls out the story slowly and draws you in emotionally. You begin to partake of Ida Graber's grief and sorrow.

1366596,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B003V3FSO6,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[5, 5]","A powerful depiction of a stricken community that taught the world about faith. Reporters raced to Nickel Mines in 2006 to cover an Amish schoolroom slaughter. What they found, unique grace and forgiveness, taught the world a lesson. This rural Amish community moved hearts world-wide, pointed to God, and forgave in a way many had never heard about. It was a powerful story then, and is just as emotional and heart-wrenching in the DVD depiction. It is an inspirational lesson in grace and forgiveness, even though it did not eliminate the Amish grief. Real people, a real story, a real way of life.Ida (Kimberly Williams-Paisley), mother of a murdered child, struggles with her own Amish faith through the ordeal. But even she learns, from the courage of her child, forgiveness is essential and she says, ""I can do no less."" Jill Green (Fay Masterson), is a TV-reporter caught up in getting the story plus her own education about grace. Tammy Blanchard plays the wife of the killer. Matt Letcher is Gideon, Ida's Amish husband and one of the first to offer Amish Grace.I remember the days the real Nickel Mines story rolled across the TV and covered the front page of every newspaper. It sickened your heart and brought men to tears. This DVD is so well done, beautifully filmed, with excellent music, that the emotion returns, even for those of us who watched and remember. This is a realistic depiction of the Amish community. I live in an area of Indiana Amish, little different than those at Nickel Mines, and can attest that the presentation is very authentic.I also have read the book ""Amish Grace"" (excellent, buy it) & listened to one of the book's 3 authors talk about the good Amish people. ""Amish Grace: How Forgiveness Transcended Tragedy"" is by Donald B. Kraybill, Steven M. Nolt, and David L. Weaver-Zercher; all experts in the life, history, and faith of the Amish. The DVD was expertly created from the facts and history provided in the book by these 3 men. This story is not Hollywood, it is reality, and the godly people of the event are honestly depicted.The DVD does have SUBTITLES.

This movie is exceptional and shows the grace of forgiveness we as Christians should all posses.  I bought two and will buy more as gifts.  You cannot have forgiveness unless there is reconciliation and both have to be from the heart as Jesus took our sins and reconciled us to the Father.  This is a true story of parents who lost children and showed Mathew 6:14-15 which God commands.  Unfortunately in the Christian circles in many church's the so-called-Christians are the only ones who shoots its wounded which is not what God commanded.  If you have unforgiveness in your heart this movie maybe difficult for you to watch knowing that it is not a fictional movie.

1366605,A3Q04XXGGED746,B003V3FSO6,"Jan Peczkis ""Scholar and Thinker""","[2, 2]","Instead of repeating other reviewers, I mostly focus on unmentioned content. To begin with, the killer was no stranger. He was a milkman known to the children and parents. He was no psychopath. To the contrary: He was an ordinary family man. His daughter had died on the day she was born, and he wanted to get back at God by killing some girls. It was a premeditated act: He purchased the firearms and bullets a week before committing the crime. The killer's wife had no inkling what he was about to do, and their son thought that the killer must have been someone else, not his father.WARNING: This movie is very emotionally intense. It does not give pat answers. Nor does it have a particularly happy ending, although it does have surprising testimony, from a girl who came out of a coma, about how the doomed girls acted in the last moments of their lives.As news of the killing spreads, frantic parents arrive, desperately hoping that their missing children are at some hospital, not the morgue. (This is reminiscent of what happened immediately after the Our Lady of the Angels School fire of 1958). The father immediately realizes that his eldest daughter is among the fatalities when he recognizes her new boots sticking out from the covered bodies being evacuated into the morgue on stretchers.One of the mothers, and the younger sister whose older sister perished, refuse to forgive the killer. At this time, misconceptions about forgiveness are dispelled.  (As someone who confessedly has struggled with forgiveness during his life, I found this helpful.) Forgiveness does not in any way imply a trivializing of the pain and grief of the loss. Forgiveness does not mean forgetting, nor does it diminish the gravity of the crime. Forgiveness does not cancel retributive justice. To the contrary: The killer is ""let go"" by the victims so that he may face the judgment and punishment of God. Letting go of the hate frees the person who is experiencing the hate.Most of the media consists of secularists, and they tend to have at least a latent anti-Christian bias. This shows up in the form of journalists a priori doubting the genuineness of the forgiveness practiced by the Amish. The journalists tend to think that the Amish forgiveness was just an outward, scripted act, and their investigation begins with the expectation that this is exactly what they will find.Finally, the movie touches upon survivor guilt. A younger sister, who had preserved her life by running out of the doomed schoolhouse, verbalizes a wish that she had been killed instead of her older sister.",5,"Practicing Forgiveness, But Understanding First What Forgiveness Is and What It Is Not",1294617600,"01 10, 2011",2011,2581,"['Instead', 'repeating', 'other', 'reviewers', 'mostly', 'focus', 'unmentioned', 'content', 'begin', 'killer', 'was', 'stranger', 'was', 'milkman', 'known', 'children', 'parents', 'was', 'psychopath', 'contrary', 'was', 'ordinary', 'family', 'man', 'daughter', 'had', 'died', 'day', 'was', 'born', 'wanted', 'get', 'back', 'God', 'killing', 'girls', 'was', 'premeditated', 'act', 'purchased', 'firearms', 'bullets', 'week', 'committing', 'crime', 'killer', 'wife', 'had', 'inkling', 'what', 'was', 'about', 'do', 'son', 'thought', 'killer', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'someone', 'else', 'not', 'father.WARNING', 'movie', 'very', 'emotionally', 'intense', 'not', 'give', 'pat', 'answers', 'have', 'particularly', 'happy', 'ending', 'have', 'surprising', 'testimony', 'girl', 'who', 'came', 'out', 'coma', 'how', 'doomed', 'girls', 'acted', 'last', 'moments', 'lives.As', 'news', 'killing', 'spreads', 'frantic', 'parents', 'arrive', 'desperately', 'hoping', 'missing', 'children', 'are', 'hospital', 'not', 'morgue', 'reminiscent', 'what', 'happened', 'immediately', 'Lady', 'Angels', 'School', 'fire', '1958', 'father', 'immediately', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'fatalities', 'when', 'new', 'boots', 'sticking', 'out', 'covered', 'bodies', 'being', 'evacuated', 'morgue', 'stretchers.One', 'mothers', 'younger', 'sister', 'older', 'sister', 'perished', 'refuse', 'forgive', 'killer', 'time', 'misconceptions', 'forgiveness', 'are', 'dispelled', 'someone', 'who', 'confessedly', 'struggled', 'forgiveness', 'life', 'found', 'helpful', 'Forgiveness', 'not', 'way', 'imply', 'trivializing', 'pain', 'grief', 'loss', 'Forgiveness', 'not', 'mean', 'forgetting', 'diminish', 'gravity', 'crime', 'Forgiveness', 'not', 'cancel', 'retributive', 'justice', 'contrary', 'killer', 'let', 'go', 'victims', 'so', 'may', 'face', 'judgment', 'punishment', 'God', 'Letting', 'go', 'hate', 'person', 'who', 'experiencing', 'hate.Most', 'media', 'secularists', 'tend', 'have', 'least', 'latent', 'anti-Christian', 'bias', 'up', 'form', 'journalists', 'priori', 'doubting', 'genuineness', 'forgiveness', 'practiced', 'Amish', 'journalists', 'tend', 'think', 'Amish', 'forgiveness', 'was', 'just', 'outward', 'scripted', 'act', 'investigation', 'expectation', 'exactly', 'what', 'will', 'find.Finally', 'movie', 'survivor', 'guilt', 'A', 'younger', 'sister', 'who', 'had', 'preserved', 'life', 'running', 'out', 'doomed', 'schoolhouse', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'killed', 'instead', 'older', 'sister']",Amish Grace

The main family in the story is fictional, however. Great acting and screenplay.  Emotional without being manipulative. Violent without showing any violence. Inspirational without being preachy. I have always been critical of faith-based films that are basically 'sermons disguised as films'. Faith-based films should be great stories where the message is an integral part of the story. This is one of those. At the heart of the story is a horrific crime. A lone gunman backs his pickup to a one room Amish school, walks in and proceeds to kill five young Amish girls and wound five others.  What happens after that is almost as unbelievable. Three Amish men, including the father of one of the victims, visit the home of the killer to offer forgiveness and help to the gunman's widow. But not everyone finds it easy to forgive.  Ida Graber (Paisley) isn't buying it. 'I will not betray my daughter by forgiving her killer'.  What follows is for the most part the struggle between two women, both mothers & wives, struggling with forgiveness and their husbands from two totally different perspectives. While we may all have a tendency to see the Amish as stoic and and almost mechanical or robotic in their faith, this is not at all what comes thru in the film. While raising (but not answering) some inconsistencies in their practices, we see them as real humans struggling to deal with this horrific crime against their community. One of the most powerful scenes is at the funeral for the gunman. This is a movie that will haunt you and stick with you as you consider (at least I did) how to live out a live of forgiving with even just the most mundane grievances. What could this mean for communities, our nation and our world if forgiveness were truly practiced.  I highly recommend this film.

Fortunately, though, this film transcended its medium and proved to be an extraordinary telling of the fallout of a horrible event.  I was thoroughly impressed with the honesty, passion, and compassion shown by the directors, writers, and actors in this film.  The fact that they were able to adequately portray the horror of the event without us ever hearing even a single shot is a beautiful example of what filmmakers can do when they allow us to use our imaginations--something that most people in the industry seem to be incapable of doing.The conflicts in the characters, from the parents of the children and the siblings and peers of the victims, to the reporter who covers the story, are very real and very well presented.  The main character, played by Kimberly Williams Paisley, gives a stellar performance as an incredibly conflicted woman who is having a very difficult time dealing not just with her daughter's death, but with the forgiveness that her husband and others are showing for an ""unforgivable"" act.  The actor who plays her husband, whose name I don't know, gives an extremely convincing performance, too.All in all, this is a film that can bring you to tears without manipulating you--the emotions you feel are real, and the people you feel them for are real.
