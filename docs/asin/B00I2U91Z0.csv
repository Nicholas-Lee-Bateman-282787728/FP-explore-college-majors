I will not say something stupid, like, &#34;it was the worst movie I've ever seen, and I want my money back, people who review like that just haven't seen many movies or they have been incredibly luck and just never seen bad movies before.  Rob Moretti let me down, bad directing but even worse screenplay, I mean bad.  Not a movie I would view more than once, although, there is full frontal of SPL, and He has a bod and a half.

1693245,A2KARIOEGE27DW,B00I2U91Z0,"MountainMan ""David""","[17, 19]","Caleb (Sean Paul Lockhart aka Brent Corrigan - ""Milk,"" ""Judas Kiss"") is in jail talking to Psychologist (Blanche Baker - ""Sixteen Candles"") about his online hookup and subsequent relationship with Jeremy (Rob Moretti - ""Crutch"" who also directed and wrote Truth). Told entirely in flashbacks, Caleb talks about their relationship, supposedly based upon honesty, and about his foster mother, brilliantly played by Suzanne Didonna (""Boy Wonder"" and ""Seduction)."" Her acting role was so disgustingly dark, disturbing and homophobic that I had to fast forward some of the scenes. They were just too troubling.If you can make it through the first hour and 5 minutes of deception, ""in your face"" homophobia, internalized homophobia, mental illness, prescription drug abuse, and the stereotypical theme about how dysfunctional gay men attract only other dysfunctional gay men, you will be rewarded with a psychological thriller, hot love scenes (including a disturbingly erotic rape scene!), good acting by Lockhart and Didonna, so-so acting by Moretti (had he directed in fake tears for his own role it would have helped the torture scenes), horrible, non-existent acting by Maura Foley, and it will have you sitting on the edge of your seat until the surprising, unexpected and somewhat unrealistic, ending. At the end you may be asking yourself if what you just watched was ""real,"" especially after the thrown in Psychological term ""Brief Reactive Psychosis.""The music is overdone and too loud in a few places (probably for some kind of dramatic effect) but it seemed to echo too much and some of the dialog, especially when Caleb talked to himself, was barely audible. What is way to obvious throughout this film is the built-in Andrew Christian Underwear commercials! Brent Corrigan is not shy about full frontal nudity and lots of frontal closeups of his ""Andrew Christians.'"" The tender romantic lovemaking was not however, distracting until the film started turning to its darker side and (obviously on purpose) included one post-coital ""fluid"" scene and later, the rape scene.There is a cameo close to the end of HAWT Amsterdam actor Max Rhyser who played in 2013's ""Chaser"" about the gay BB community.Beware men who bring flowers when you first meet for coffee and medicine cabinets full of prescription drugs!",4,Another gay dysfunctional study or Hitchcockian Psychological Thriller?,1398124800,"04 22, 2014",2014,2313,"['Caleb', 'Sean', 'Paul', 'Lockhart', 'Brent', 'Corrigan', 'Milk', 'Judas', 'Kiss', 'jail', 'talking', 'Psychologist', 'Blanche', 'Baker', 'Sixteen', 'Candles', 'online', 'hookup', 'subsequent', 'relationship', 'Jeremy', 'Rob', 'Moretti', 'Crutch', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'wrote', 'Truth', 'Told', 'entirely', 'flashbacks', 'Caleb', 'talks', 'relationship', 'supposedly', 'based', 'honesty', 'foster', 'mother', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'Suzanne', 'Didonna', 'Boy', 'Wonder', 'Seduction', 'acting', 'role', 'was', 'so', 'disgustingly', 'dark', 'disturbing', 'homophobic', 'had', 'fast', 'forward', 'scenes', 'were', 'just', 'too', 'troubling.If', 'can', 'make', 'first', 'hour', '5', 'minutes', 'deception', 'face', 'homophobia', 'internalized', 'homophobia', 'mental', 'illness', 'prescription', 'drug', 'abuse', 'stereotypical', 'theme', 'how', 'dysfunctional', 'gay', 'men', 'attract', 'only', 'other', 'dysfunctional', 'gay', 'men', 'will', 'be', 'rewarded', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'hot', 'love', 'scenes', 'including', 'disturbingly', 'erotic', 'rape', 'scene', 'good', 'acting', 'Lockhart', 'Didonna', 'so-so', 'acting', 'Moretti', 'had', 'directed', 'fake', 'tears', 'own', 'role', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'torture', 'scenes', 'horrible', 'non-existent', 'acting', 'Maura', 'Foley', 'will', 'have', 'sitting', 'edge', 'seat', 'surprising', 'unexpected', 'somewhat', 'unrealistic', 'ending', 'end', 'may', 'be', 'asking', 'what', 'just', 'watched', 'was', 'real', 'especially', 'thrown', 'Psychological', 'term', 'Brief', 'Reactive', 'Psychosis', 'music', 'overdone', 'too', 'loud', 'few', 'places', 'probably', 'kind', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'seemed', 'echo', 'too', 'much', 'dialog', 'especially', 'when', 'Caleb', 'talked', 'was', 'barely', 'audible', 'What', 'way', 'obvious', 'film', 'built-in', 'Andrew', 'Christian', 'Underwear', 'commercials', 'Brent', 'Corrigan', 'not', 'shy', 'full', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'lots', 'frontal', 'closeups', 'Andrew', 'Christians', 'tender', 'romantic', 'lovemaking', 'was', 'not', 'however', 'distracting', 'film', 'started', 'turning', 'darker', 'side', 'obviously', 'purpose', 'included', 'one', 'post-coital', 'fluid', 'scene', 'later', 'rape', 'cameo', 'close', 'end', 'HAWT', 'Amsterdam', 'actor', 'Max', 'Rhyser', 'who', 'played', '2013', 'Chaser', 'gay', 'BB', 'community.Beware', 'men', 'who', 'bring', 'flowers', 'when', 'first', 'meet', 'coffee', 'medicine', 'cabinets', 'full', 'prescription', 'drugs']",Truth
