1682751,A3BR26ITFVPYTC,B00GY3S5AY,jerbearmy,"[12, 13]","Mardock Scramble has been a great ride...  It's been once of the most visceral storytellings I've ever experienced.  There's the criminal underworld, corrupt officials, human depravity, and broken characters.  The story is violent, sexual, reflecting, and gives a perfect picture of the despair inside a person whose been abandoned by the world.  The viewer feels not only this despair, but also the bleak and often fleeting hope for redemption.  The animation is beautiful film noir (I fell in love after the first frame of the first movie), and the soundtrack--particularly the choice of ""Amazing Grace"" at the end of the first movie and repeated during this third--is exceptional.  Personally, I loved the first movie, but I was a little let down by the second one...  (I thought the Eden scenes were interesting, but didn't have the emotional impact of the first movie or of the casino scenes).  The Third Exhaust is a perfect ending to the story.The first half of the Third Exhaust finishes the casino heist of the second movie.  I had to pause the movie after this part to take everything in; it's excellent.  After recovering Shell's lost memories, they proceed to wrap up Balot's case.Mardock Scamble is a story of fallenness, despair, and little-by-little... redemption.  Unlike stories with a perfect hero who completely saves the day; it's a real story of the battle just to get through life, and maybe come out a little bit better.  The story is difficult to watch, but to anyone who has the stomach for it, I highly recommend it.",5,Perfect Ending to the Series,1386201600,"12 5, 2013",2013,1542,"['Mardock', 'Scramble', 'been', 'great', 'ride', 'been', 'once', 'most', 'visceral', 'storytellings', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'experienced', 'criminal', 'underworld', 'corrupt', 'officials', 'human', 'depravity', 'broken', 'characters', 'story', 'violent', 'sexual', 'reflecting', 'perfect', 'picture', 'despair', 'person', 'been', 'abandoned', 'world', 'viewer', 'not', 'only', 'despair', 'also', 'bleak', 'often', 'fleeting', 'hope', 'redemption', 'animation', 'beautiful', 'film', 'noir', 'fell', 'love', 'first', 'frame', 'first', 'movie', 'soundtrack', 'particularly', 'choice', 'Amazing', 'Grace', 'end', 'first', 'movie', 'repeated', 'third', 'exceptional', 'Personally', 'loved', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'little', 'let', 'down', 'second', 'one', 'thought', 'Eden', 'scenes', 'were', 'interesting', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'emotional', 'impact', 'first', 'movie', 'casino', 'scenes', 'Third', 'Exhaust', 'perfect', 'ending', 'story.The', 'first', 'half', 'Third', 'Exhaust', 'casino', 'heist', 'second', 'movie', 'had', 'pause', 'movie', 'part', 'take', 'everything', 'excellent', 'recovering', 'Shell', 'lost', 'memories', 'proceed', 'wrap', 'up', 'Balot', 'case.Mardock', 'Scamble', 'story', 'fallenness', 'despair', 'little-by-little', 'redemption', 'stories', 'perfect', 'hero', 'who', 'completely', 'day', 'real', 'story', 'battle', 'just', 'get', 'life', 'maybe', 'come', 'out', 'little', 'bit', 'better', 'story', 'difficult', 'watch', 'anyone', 'who', 'stomach', 'highly', 'recommend']",Mardock Scramble: The Third Exhaust

The story picks up immediately after the second episode without any transition so if you want to know what is going on you need to watch the first two episodes/show.  Rune finally puts the rest the memories and enemies that have attacked her and finds purpose in her life. There is an epic battle between Rune and Boiled. The makers of the film have compressed the story line in the book, which improves the pacing immensely, but which leaves a few logic holes you might wonder about.  For example, the book tells how, exactly she beat the second blackjack dealer and how she penetrated the impenetrable shield that Boiled had.FYI, the author has a 35 page short story of an episode with Dr. Easter, Oeufcoque, and Boiled which takes place before Boiled went bad that is available for free on iBooks for your iPad.
