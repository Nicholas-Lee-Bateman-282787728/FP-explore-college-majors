1315662,A37MH7ICH80QOX,B0030U1TUC,Kate McMurry,"[1, 2]","I'm always looking for female standup comics to enjoy, and Anjelah Johnson is one of the best of the best of the women in that business.""That's How We Do It"" was recorded at the Verizon Theater in Houston. It is Anjelah's debut standup album with a major label. Every minute of this show is full of energy and wild humor. Anjelah is a former professional cheerleader for the Oakland Raiders, and it is a humorously unexpected choice for a woman this gorgeous to perform standup routines based in self-deprecation. She pulls off that schtick brilliantly. One of her specialties is to do imitations of the accents of various ethnic groups, both males and females. She's dead on and howlingly funny at it.In her opening riff, she describes herself as half Mexican and half Native American. She says that people ask her all the time, with that heritage, how did she end up with a surname like Johnson? After the audience waits a beat to hear some kind of explanation, she shrugs and says, she has no idea--to great laughter. And *then* she launches on a series of colorful stories about living with a totally unexpected last name. This is the flow of her stories on this album:1.What's Up Houston?2.My Name3.Growing Up Poor4.Married Couples5.Technology6.Nosey Sister7.Sneak Into A Club8.Oakland Raiders9.Nail Salon10.Blue Shirt11.Head Nod12.Big Butt13.That's How We Do It14.Church15.Roscoes16.Karate17.Kill 'Em With Kindness18.Hollywood Homeless19.New Car20.Valet21.Southwest Airlines22.Beat Freaks Intro23.Family Oriented24.Fortune Cookie25.Dating Habits26.Christian Rap27.Talking To Married Couples28.Meet Tia MaryIf you are looking for a wonderful time, filled with hysterical laughter, you couldn't do better than this talented comedian.",5,Filled with belly laughs!,1362441600,"03 5, 2013",2013,1737,"[""'m"", 'always', 'looking', 'female', 'standup', 'comics', 'enjoy', 'Anjelah', 'Johnson', 'one', 'best', 'best', 'women', 'business', 'How', 'Do', 'was', 'recorded', 'Verizon', 'Theater', 'Houston', 'Anjelah', 'debut', 'album', 'major', 'label', 'minute', 'show', 'full', 'energy', 'wild', 'humor', 'Anjelah', 'former', 'professional', 'cheerleader', 'Oakland', 'Raiders', 'humorously', 'unexpected', 'choice', 'woman', 'gorgeous', 'perform', 'standup', 'routines', 'based', 'self-deprecation', 'schtick', 'brilliantly', 'One', 'specialties', 'do', 'imitations', 'accents', 'various', 'ethnic', 'groups', 'males', 'females', 'dead', 'howlingly', 'funny', 'it.In', 'opening', 'riff', 'half', 'Mexican', 'half', 'Native', 'American', 'people', 'ask', 'time', 'heritage', 'how', 'did', 'end', 'up', 'surname', 'Johnson', 'audience', 'beat', 'hear', 'kind', 'explanation', 'shrugs', 'idea', 'great', 'laughter', '*then*', 'series', 'colorful', 'stories', 'living', 'totally', 'unexpected', 'last', 'name', 'flow', 'stories', 'album:1.What', 'Up', 'Houston', '2.My', 'Name3.Growing', 'Up', 'Poor4.Married', 'Couples5.Technology6.Nosey', 'Sister7.Sneak', 'Into', 'A', 'Club8.Oakland', 'Raiders9.Nail', 'Salon10.Blue', 'Shirt11.Head', 'Nod12.Big', 'Butt13.That', 'How', 'Do', 'It14.Church15.Roscoes16.Karate17.Kill', ""'Em"", 'Kindness18.Hollywood', 'Homeless19.New', 'Car20.Valet21.Southwest', 'Airlines22.Beat', 'Freaks', 'Intro23.Family', 'Oriented24.Fortune', 'Cookie25.Dating', 'Habits26.Christian', 'Rap27.Talking', 'Married', 'Couples28.Meet', 'Tia', 'MaryIf', 'are', 'looking', 'wonderful', 'time', 'filled', 'hysterical', 'laughter', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'better', 'talented', 'comedian']",That's How We Do It
