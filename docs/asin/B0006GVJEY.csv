867634,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0006GVJEY,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[7, 10]","Films are changing with the changing society in which we live.  As films try to adapt into the growing world, we find ourselves trying to find the films that do not sugarcoat the truth or deface a positive change.  I have seen several films lately that just put the positive changes in our society in a negative light.  Thankfully, Touch of Pink is not one of those films.  It is an imaginative film that takes the glamour of Hollywood love (through the character of Cary Grant) and combines it with an ever-changing world.  While I will admit the Canadian/Muslim depiction in this film is a bit Eurocentric and at times glossy, it is only due to the fact that director Ian Iqbal Rashid has a cornucopia of information on such a small plate.  Add to this a mixed bag of chemistry between our two lovers, Alim and Giles, and some definite need for more rehearsals, you may loose sight of one of the greatest assets to this film, the one, the only, Kyle MacLachlan.The story is simple.  Muslim man who happens to be gay tries to tell his mother of his lifestyle to see if it would bring them closer together.  It is similar to nearly every other gay film out there that has the underlying theme of family.  The story is nothing to write home about, in fact, if this story never went out of the box, I don't think I would be speaking so highly of it, but the genuine greatness of this film is the magical element of Cary Grant.  MacLachlan supercedes himself by taking this role and transforming it into quite possibly the best character of the film.  His quick tongue and wit really define him as both an actor as well as the best element for this film.  He embodies Grant so well that if anyone were to do a biopic on Grant, I think MacLachlan would be the best for the role.  His interaction with Alim gives us that invisible/imaginary friend relationship that only those that had similar friends growing up would understand.  Created from a lack of father figure and many films, Grant helps Alim go through life's hurdles.  He is Alim's security blanket against life.  Together, these two work very well together.  In fact, they work so well together that I continually waited for more scenes between them or involving them.  MacLachlan's involvement in this project propelled Touch of Pink from average love story to something a bit more spectacular.I wish I could compliment the connection between Alim and the rest of the cast.  Sadly, the chemistry between Alim and his boyfriend Giles was horrible.  I never once believed that they were in love or a couple.  There seemed to be some conflicting emotions ravishing between them and a bit of arrogance that just didn't settle well for the ""love"" scenes.  I don't know if it was the acting of these two actors or the fact that perhaps they were just not comfortable with each other.  Either way, they were not able to translate their love through the screen very well at all.  The same goes for Alim's interaction with his mother.  I just never saw the struggle that the two of them needed to demonstrate.  They jumped to easily from one emotion to another, never really allowing us to feel the tension or love between them.  This leads me to think that perhaps the casting of Jimi Mistry was the wrong choice.  He just didn't seem to fit with anyone in this film except Grant.  Was he only supposed to connect to Grant because he was his imaginary friend, a creation of Alim's mind?  I don't know, all I do know is that the actors interacting with each other was like water and oil instead of water and water.  The mixture didn't seem to gel.Finally, I think what the story lacked (and I hinted upon this earlier in the review) was the strong culture that Alim was fighting against.  I felt too much time was spent in London, where his gay lifestyle is a bit more accepted, than in the Muslim culture where he would have to fight for acceptance.  I wanted, in fact, I needed to see more interactions with Alim's family than what was allotted.  There was also a confusing element thrown into the end that just should have been left out.  It did not progress the story, only build confusion and unbalance in the overall scheme of things.  The culture element is what I was hoping for in this film.  I wanted to see a Muslim love story with imagination and creativity that broke social boundaries and I kind of did, but it wasn't bold enough.  That is my biggest problem with this film.  I felt that hidden somewhere between Jimi's troublesome acting and Ian Iqbal Rashid's choppy direction there was a strong message that wanted to be said about homosexuality in the Muslim culture, but it never came forward.  It was almost as if there was a ""scared"" factor built somewhere in this film.Overall, this was a decent film.  There could have been a stronger message about Muslim homosexuality and family values, but it was countered well with Kyle MacLachlan's stunning portrayal of Cary Grant.  It was his character's element that really impressed me about this film.  Perhaps stronger editing or direction would have strengthened the story, but I had MacLachlan, and that was joy enough.  I would suggest this film for couples looking for a date film or anyone interested in gay cinema, but for me there was just this tugging sensation that this film could have gone further, deeper into the ""rabbit hole"" so to speak, but chose to play it safe.Grade: *** out of *****",3,Muslim culture painted Pink!,1106352000,"01 22, 2005",2005,5419,"['Films', 'are', 'changing', 'changing',

867639,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0006GVJEY,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 3]","This trifle of a movie bears more than a passing resemblance to Ang Lee's 1993 ""The Wedding Banquet"", but it also owes a debt to the Universal Studios romantic comedies of the late 1950's-early 1960's by way of Bollywood. Truer to the spirit of those Doris Day-Rock Hudson concoctions than the far more costly and laborious send-up, Peyton Reed's 2003 ""Down With Love"", this 2004 indie film has a more contemporary agenda in mind. With his first feature-length film, director Ian Iqbal Rashid uses a narrative device I haven't seen since Herbert Ross's ""Play It Again, Sam"" - whereas Woody Allen channeled the spirit of Humphrey Bogart in the former film, the gay protagonist here does the same with Cary Grant, apparently his ""imaginary"" friend since childhood when his mother deserted him temporarily for the excitement of life in London. The movie star provides unsolicited guidance on romantic relationships and the importance of appearing straight in a world hostile to gays.Choosing Grant (over a more predictable gay icon like Rock Hudson) is intriguing in that he was a celebrity surrounded by innuendo about his sexuality. It all sounds silly and derivative - and to a great degree, it is - but the movie maintains a sweet tone with surprising shades of resonance toward the latter part of the film. I just wish the film could have gone down a more audacious path to match its concept. The story revolves around Alim, a Toronto-raised South Asian who is now living in London with his boyfriend of a year. His mother Nuru comes to visit him unexpectedly prodding him to return to Toronto and marry a nice Indian girl. The problem is that Alim has not come out to his devout Muslim mother, and he has to decide to either tell her about his situation or risk losing his boyfriend Giles, who was quite a player prior to Alim. The plot machinations at the beginning provide an excuse for broad caricatures and silly predicaments much like the movies to which Rashid is paying tribute, and Nuru is initially portrayed as the typical guilt-skewering mother. However, the movie takes some interesting turns with Giles and Nuru having an unexpected rendezvous through London and the plot strands coming together at the traditional wedding of Alim's cousin back in Toronto.The cast is variable in quality. Jimi Mistry portrays Alim with genuine vulnerability and palpable angst even if he has an unfortunate habit of looking constipated during his more dramatic moments. Better is Suleka Mathew, though too young to be playing Nuru, she at least gets to play a more complete character arc from a kvetching harpy to supportive mother. As Giles, Kristen Holden-Reid does what he can with a rather bland part. Playing the impossible role of Cary Grant, Kyle MacLachlan is surprisingly good if you can get past the fact that Grant is unplayable without a certain sense of parody and impersonation. Aided by a series of wardrobe changes true to Grant's most famous films, MacLachlan actually get the voice down right and certainly has the requisite square jaw, but I wonder if his obtrusive phantom presence should have been supplanted by computer animation or even a voiceover to convey his character's purpose.  Brian George, who played the familiar Seinfeld character Babu Bhatt, as Uncle Hassan and Verna Sood as Aunt Dolly provide solid comic support. Yet, in spite of the creativity in adapting familiar movie concepts, overall the film feels relatively tepid.",3,Mishmash of Romantic Comedy Clich&eacute;s Produces a Sweet Though Tepid Comedy,1135728000,"12 28, 2005",2005,3460,"['trifle', 'movie', 'more', 'passing', 'resemblance', 'Ang', 'Lee', '1993', 'Wedding', 'Banquet', 'also', 'debt', 'Universal', 'Studios', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'late', ""1950's-early"", '1960', 'way', 'Bollywood', 'Truer', 'spirit', 'Doris', 'Day-Rock', 'Hudson', 'concoctions', 'far', 'more', 'costly', 'laborious', 'send-up', 'Peyton', 'Reed', '2003', 'Down', 'Love', '2004', 'indie', 'film', 'more', 'contemporary', 'agenda', 'mind', 'first', 'feature-length', 'film', 'director', 'Ian', 'Iqbal', 'Rashid', 'narrative', 'device', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Herbert', 'Ross', 'Play', 'Again', 'Sam', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'channeled', 'spirit', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'former', 'film', 'gay', 'protagonist', 'here', 'same', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'apparently', 'imaginary', 'friend', 'childhood', 'when', 'mother', 'deserted', 'temporarily', 'excitement', 'life', 'London', 'movie', 'star', 'unsolicited', 'guidance', 'romantic', 'relationships', 'importance', 'appearing', 'straight', 'world', 'hostile', 'gays.Choosing', 'Grant', 'more', 'predictable', 'gay', 'icon', 'Rock', 'Hudson', 'intriguing', 'was', 'celebrity', 'surrounded', 'innuendo', 'sexuality', 'silly', 'derivative', 'great', 'degree', 'movie', 'sweet', 'tone', 'surprising', 'shades', 'resonance', 'latter', 'part', 'film', 'just', 'wish', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'down', 'more', 'audacious', 'path', 'match', 'concept', 'story', 'Alim', 'Toronto-raised', 'South', 'Asian', 'who', 'now', 'living', 'London', 'boyfriend', 'year', 'mother', 'Nuru', 'visit', 'unexpectedly', 'prodding', 'return', 'Toronto', 'marry', 'nice', 'Indian', 'girl', 'problem', 'Alim', 'not', 'come', 'out', 'devout', 'Muslim', 'mother', 'decide', 'tell', 'situation', 'risk', 'losing', 'boyfriend', 'Giles', 'who', 'was', 'quite', 'player', 'prior', 'Alim', 'plot', 'machinations', 'beginning', 'provide', 'excuse', 'broad', 'caricatures', 'silly', 'predicaments', 'much', 'movies', 'Rashid', 'paying', 'tribute', 'Nuru', 'initially', 'portrayed', 'typical', 'guilt-skewering', 'mother', 'However', 'movie', 'interesting', 'turns', 'Giles', 'Nuru', 'having', 'unexpected', 'rendezvous', 'London', 'plot', 'coming', 'together', 'traditional', 'wedding', 'Alim', 'cousin', 'back', 'Toronto.The', 'cast', 'variable', 'quality', 'Jimi', 'Mistry', 'Alim', 'genuine', 'vulnerability', 'palpable', 'angst', 'even', 'unfortunate', 'habit', 'looking', 'constipated', 'more', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'Better', 'Suleka', 'Mathew', 'though', 'too', 'young', 'be', 'playing', 'Nuru', 'least', 'play', 'more', 'complete', 'character', 'arc', 'kvetching', 'harpy', 'supportive', 'mother', 'Giles', 'Kristen', 'Holden-Reid', 'what', 'can', 'rather', 'bland', 'part', 'Playing', 'impossible', 'role', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Kyle', 'MacLachlan', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'can', 'get', 'fact', 'Grant', 'unplayable', 'certain', 'sense', 'parody', 'impersonation', 'Aided', 'series', 'wardrobe', 'changes', 'true', 'Grant', 'most', 'famous', 'films', 'MacLachlan', 'actually', 'get', 'voice', 'down', 'right', 'certainly', 'requisite', 'square', 'jaw', 'wonder', 'obtrusive', 'phantom', 'presence', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'supplanted', 'computer', 'animation', 'even', 'voiceover', 'convey', 'character', 'purpose', 'Brian', 'George', 'who', 'played', 'familiar', 'Seinfeld', 'character', 'Babu', 'Bhatt', 'Uncle', 'Hassan', 'Verna', 'Sood', 'Aunt', 'Dolly', 'provide', 'solid', 'comic', 'support', 'spite', 'creativity', 'adapting', 'familiar', 'movie', 'concepts', 'film', 'feels', 'relatively', 'tepid']",N/A

In TOUCH OF PINK he has taken the best of both and created a tender, charming, warmly funny tale of the struggle of a Pakistani young cameraman Alim (Jimi Mistry) in coming to grips with his sexuality.  Yes, the story has been done many times, but rarely with the genuine tenderness Rashid has found.Alim, a transplanted Pakistani youth born in Kenya, raised in Toronto, Canada and living in London, has a guardian angel in the form of Cary Grant (Kyle MacLachlan) who has replaced his father he never knew and who is his constant companion in his flat in London - giving advice Alim wants to hear while acting as a curtain to shield Alim from the more difficult facts of his being an openly gay male. Alim is in love with Giles (Kristen Holden-Ried) and they live a happy life together - until Alim's mother Nuru (Suleka Mathew) comes to pay them a visit.Nuru has lived alone since her husband's death, always longing for a fantasy life of fleeing the restrictions of Indian culture to become a star like Doris Day.  Her life is one of frustration and her hopes for something better seem to rest on her only son Alim's getting married so that Nuru can compete with her sister currently planning an extravagant wedding for her own son Khaled.Once in London, Nuru finds Alim cold, living with a British man, and finds her hopes for a possible wedding quashed. Giles takes the reluctant Nuru for a shopping and dancing day and wins her heart.  But when Nuru finally discovers Alim's secret, she leaves London, hurt, sad, and despondent.  Giles is angry with Alim's harsh handling of their relationship and leaves Alim to the sole companionship of his Cary Grant.  Through a series of discoveries and introspection Alim flies to Toronto to the wedding of his cousin, to appease Nuru, and there Pandora's Box opens resulting is a series of surprises that bring the actions to resolution. Though many will have seen the end coming, for those who have not seen the movie, telling the plot ending would be a sad disservice!The dialogue is smart, the use of the Cary Grant guardian angel is excellent (especially given the fine performance by Kyle MacLachlan), and the characters as portrayed by this talented and attractive cast are indeed loveable.  This is a feel-good movie, a fine statement about being true to one's self, and a healthy look at gay relationships that are not either 1) candy coated or 2) sadistic or doomed. Highly recommended.

867642,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B0006GVJEY,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 0]","This film tries to explore the complicated love story between a Muslim, born in Kenya, raised then in India, then in Canada, and moved to London to have a photographer's career, if the details are right, without a father who died early and with a cousin who considered that sex had to be satisfied with him since girls were out of the picture. That practice is quite common among Muslim teenagers, the big brother taking his toll on the smaller brothersBut that is trite too. So how can we make a good film about that or with that?Simple. Move the action from Toronto to London and make that young Alim have a doppelganger in the identity of Cary Grant who is advising him on everything and particularly on his sex life. Cary Grant, the doppelganger, was reconstructed from the numerous films he watched under the influence of his mother in Kenya or India and in Canada. That gives the film a disquieting dimension already.Then he has to have a love affair and a boyfriend who has to be English, and he is Giles. But the mother decides to visit her son and that sets the whole situation upside down and catty corner. They decide to make her believe they are just roommates and that Alim is in love with a girl. Giles even tries to charm the mother into believing anything, but Alim gets jealous and tells the plain truth to his mother who leaves at once, in the absence of Giles who had gone to the gym.Then Giles is angry in his turn and moves out and has an affair with an Olympic swimmer. During that time Alim went to Toronto for the wedding of his cousin. Of course it is all false and awkward, especially with the cousin trying to have a stag party with Alim for fun and in remembrance of the past. Alim refuses but the mother was just behind. She will learn from her sister on the following day that her sister had negotiated a beautiful marriage and plenty of grand children with her son by letting him do what he wanted with Alim and probably others. Pure selfishness of a mother.Alim's mother understands then that she has been selfish in another direction. And that's when Giles arrives in Toronto, in the wedding party, and Alim runs to him and passionately kisses Giles in front of everyone. Then they can go. Alim will have to set Cary Grant on a permanent vacation, and love will live forever and ever.The absence of the father is a real trite commonplace banality in the fictional context of a gay man. The over-presence of the mother is nothing better, though the direct consequence of the first element. This is banal and plain ordinary popular psychoanalysis that explains nothing and even irritates the audience who would like to have a little bit more than clich&eacute;s.But the film is fine because it is well done and the subject of the contact between two societies that are so different, the Pakistani or Indian Muslim society in exile in some western country and the western society of this or these countries. Why don't the two young men just say so and run for it and let all the witnesses on the sidewalk stare and yell and roar, if they think they are and have to be judging and executing lions? Because of fear? Because they may lose what they want to keep? Because they are afraid of growing out of the traps of a family? Many other reasons that make the love at time selfish and sour.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",4,Mothers have to respected and run away from,1340755200,"06 27, 2012",2012,3339,"['film', 'explore', 'complicated', 'love', 'story', 'Muslim', 'born', 'Kenya', 'raised', 'then', 'India', 'then', 'Canada', 'moved', 'London', 'have', 'photographer', 'career', 'details', 'are', 'right', 'father', 'who', 'died', 'early', 'cousin', 'who', 'considered', 'sex', 'had', 'be', 'satisfied', 'girls', 'were', 'picture', 'practice', 'quite', 'common', 'Muslim', 'teenagers', 'big', 'brother', 'taking', 'toll', 'smaller', 'brothersBut', 'trite', 'too', 'how', 'can', 'make', 'good', 'film', 'Simple', 'Move', 'action', 'Toronto', 'London', 'make', 'young', 'Alim', 'have', 'doppelganger', 'identity', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'who', 'advising', 'everything', 'particularly', 'sex', 'life', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'doppelganger', 'was', 'reconstructed', 'numerous', 'films', 'watched', 'influence', 'mother', 'Kenya', 'India', 'Canada', 'film', 'disquieting', 'dimension', 'already.Then', 'have', 'love', 'affair', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'be', 'English', 'Giles', 'mother', 'visit', 'son', 'whole', 'situation', 'upside', 'down', 'catty', 'corner', 'decide', 'make', 'believe', 'are', 'just', 'roommates', 'Alim', 'love', 'girl', 'Giles', 'even', 'charm', 'mother', 'believing', 'anything', 'Alim', 'jealous', 'plain', 'truth', 'mother', 'who', 'once', 'absence', 'Giles', 'who', 'had', 'gone', 'gym.Then', 'Giles', 'angry', 'turn', 'out', 'affair', 'Olympic', 'swimmer', 'time', 'Alim', 'went', 'Toronto', 'wedding', 'cousin', 'course', 'false', 'awkward', 'especially', 'cousin', 'trying', 'have', 'stag', 'party', 'Alim', 'fun', 'remembrance', 'past', 'Alim', 'mother', 'was', 'just', 'will', 'learn', 'sister', 'following', 'day', 'sister', 'had', 'negotiated', 'beautiful', 'marriage', 'plenty', 'grand', 'children', 'son', 'letting', 'do', 'what', 'wanted', 'Alim', 'probably', 'others', 'Pure', 'selfishness', 'mother.Alim', 'mother', 'then', 'been', 'selfish', 'direction', 'when', 'Giles', 'Toronto', 'wedding', 'party', 'Alim', 'passionately', 'kisses', 'Giles', 'front', 'everyone', 'Then', 'can', 'go', 'Alim', 'will', 'have', 'set', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'permanent', 'vacation', 'love', 'will', 'live', 'forever', 'ever.The', 'absence', 'father', 'real', 'trite', 'commonplace', 'banality', 'fictional', 'context', 'gay', 'man', 'over-presence', 'mother', 'nothing', 'better', 'direct', 'consequence', 'first', 'element', 'banal', 'plain', 'ordinary', 'popular', 'psychoanalysis', 'nothing', 'even', 'audience', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'have', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'clich', 'eacute', 'film', 'fine', 'well', 'done', 'subject', 'contact', 'two', 'societies', 'are', 'so', 'different', 'Pakistani', 'Indian', 'Muslim', 'society', 'exile', 'western', 'country', 'western', 'society', 'countries', 'Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'two', 'young', 'men', 'just', 'say', 'so', 'run', 'let', 'witnesses', 'sidewalk', 'stare', 'yell', 'roar', 'think', 'are', 'have', 'be', 'judging', 'executing', 'lions', 'fear', 'may', 'lose', 'what', 'want', 'keep', 'are', 'afraid', 'growing', 'traps', 'family', 'Many', 'other', 'reasons', 'make', 'love', 'time', 'selfish', 'sour.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",N/A

Written by Ian Rashid, Touch of Pink stars Jimi Mistry as the hapless protaginist Alim, forced to throw his life, and his saucy boyfriend played by Kristen Holden-Reid,  back into the closet when his noisy Muslim mother decides to visit him in England. Alim's invented an imaginary friend in the form of Cary Grant, played refreshingly by Kyle McLaughlin, who offers advice through the film, not all of it good.What follows is fairly predictable, and anyone can see the ending from a mile away. But still, the journey getting there is a wonderful ride. Rashid's script is witty, and several lines earn a good hearty out-loud laugh. The performances are sharp, especially Suleka Matthew, who's obviously way too young to be Alim's mother, but delivers her lines with zing and zest and a great deal of fun.I recommend getting a Touch of Pink if you'd like a touch of fun and a good evening at the movies.",4,Touch of Fun,1107734400,"02 7, 2005",2005,1176,"['Think', 'Bend', 'Beckham', 'La', 'Cage', 'Aux', 'Folles', 'twist', 'then', ""'ll"", 'get', 'Touch', 'Pink.In', 'fun', 'nod', 'comedies', '1950', 'modern', 'implications', 'Touch', 'Pink', 'culture', 'clash', 'generation', 'clash', 'end', 'result', 'predicatable', 'fun', 'Written', 'Ian', 'Rashid', 'Touch', 'Pink', 'stars', 'Jimi', 'Mistry', 'hapless', 'protaginist', 'Alim', 'forced', 'throw', 'life', 'saucy', 'boyfriend', 'played', 'Kristen', 'Holden-Reid', 'back', 'closet', 'when', 'noisy', 'Muslim', 'mother', 'decides', 'visit', 'England', 'Alim', 'invented', 'imaginary', 'friend', 'form', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'played', 'refreshingly', 'Kyle', 'McLaughlin', 'who', 'advice', 'film', 'not', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'anyone', 'can', 'see', 'ending', 'mile', 'away', 'still', 'journey', 'getting', 'wonderful', 'ride', 'Rashid', 'script', 'witty', 'several', 'lines', 'earn', 'good', 'hearty', 'out-loud', 'laugh', 'performances', 'are', 'sharp', 'especially', 'Suleka', 'Matthew', 'who', 'obviously', 'way', 'too', 'young', 'be', 'Alim', 'mother', 'lines', 'zing', 'zest', 'great', 'deal', 'fun.I', 'recommend', 'getting', 'Touch', 'Pink', ""'d"", 'like', 'touch', 'fun', 'good', 'evening', 'movies']",N/A
867644,AQQFI7YHMRL7S,B0006GVJEY,James Morris,"[3, 3]","Within the glut of gay ""coming out comedies"" I've purchased in the past few years, I've noticed that they all seem to have similar plots.  They usually present a young gay couple, consisting of one partner who is out and comfortable with his family, job and friends, contrasted by a partner who is not out to any of these people.  Almost always, the happy couple is suddenly confronted by the visit of a parent or other relative (usually from another country or culture) from whom they must conceal the truth of their relationship, or come out once and for all.  While many of these films mean well (especially when other cultures are involved), the result is often trite, offensive or dated.  I was prepared for Touch of Pink to be all of these things, and half-wondered to myself as I purchased it why I bothered.I was in for a pleasant surprise.  The characters were real, engaging and likable.  The two actors who played the couple were not drop-dead gorgeous hunks, just pleasant looking enough to have the average gay viewer identify with them.  The gimmick of having Cary Grant as the imaginary friend of the main character worked better than I expected it to.  All too often imitations of celebrities come off as just that - imitations, and pale ones to boot.  Kyle MacLachlan has Cary Grant's vocal mannerisms down pat, without being overly exaggerated or silly.  Alim's mother is pretty, bitchy and quite a lot of fun, and her character has most of the really funny lines in the picture, which are many.  And I was also impressed not only by the production values and acting, which were first rate, but by the first class treatment given to the DVD release.  All too often, DVD's of films with gay subject matter come at very high prices with no extras whatsoever.  This disc offered subtitles in several languages (including English for the hearing impaired) a trailer and a short documentary on the making of the film.  These are extras that people who purchase mainstream films take for granted, and I am always delighted when they're included in a gay title.  All in all this film was surprisingly enjoyable, and I have no problem appraising it worthy of four stars.",4,More Fun Than I Expected,1224892800,"10 25, 2008",2008,2180,"['glut', 'gay', 'coming', 'out', 'comedies', ""'ve"", 'purchased', 'past', 'few', 'years', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'seem', 'have', 'similar', 'plots', 'usually', 'present', 'young', 'gay', 'couple', 'consisting', 'one', 'partner', 'who', 'out', 'comfortable', 'family', 'job', 'friends', 'contrasted', 'partner', 'who', 'not', 'out', 'people', 'Almost', 'always', 'happy', 'couple', 'suddenly', 'confronted', 'visit', 'parent', 'other', 'relative', 'usually', 'country', 'culture', 'whom', 'must', 'conceal', 'truth', 'relationship', 'come', 'out', 'once', 'many', 'films', 'mean', 'well', 'especially', 'when', 'other', 'cultures', 'are', 'involved', 'result', 'often', 'trite', 'offensive', 'dated', 'was', 'prepared', 'Touch', 'Pink', 'be', 'things', 'half-wondered', 'myself', 'purchased', 'why', 'bothered.I', 'was', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'characters', 'were', 'real', 'engaging', 'likable', 'two', 'actors', 'who', 'played', 'couple', 'were', 'not', 'drop-dead', 'gorgeous', 'hunks', 'just', 'pleasant', 'looking', 'enough', 'have', 'average', 'gay', 'viewer', 'identify', 'gimmick', 'having', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'imaginary', 'friend', 'main', 'character', 'worked', 'better', 'expected', 'All', 'too', 'often', 'imitations', 'celebrities', 'come', 'off', 'as', 'just', 'imitations', 'pale', 'ones', 'boot', 'Kyle', 'MacLachlan', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'vocal', 'mannerisms', 'down', 'pat', 'being', 'overly', 'exaggerated', 'silly', 'Alim', 'mother', 'pretty', 'bitchy', 'quite', 'lot', 'fun', 'character', 'most', 'really', 'funny', 'lines', 'picture', 'are', 'many', 'was', 'also', 'impressed', 'not', 'only', 'production', 'values', 'acting', 'were', 'first', 'rate', 'first', 'class', 'treatment', 'given', 'DVD', 'release', 'too', 'often', 'DVD', 'films', 'gay', 'subject', 'matter', 'come', 'very', 'high', 'prices', 'extras', 'whatsoever', 'disc', 'offered', 'subtitles', 'several', 'languages', 'including', 'English', 'hearing', 'impaired', 'trailer', 'short', 'documentary', 'making', 'film', 'are', 'extras', 'people', 'who', 'purchase', 'mainstream', 'films', 'take', 'granted', 'am', 'always', 'delighted', 'when', ""'re"", 'included', 'gay', 'title', 'film', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'enjoyable', 'have', 'problem', 'appraising', 'worthy', 'four', 'stars']",N/A

867655,A1ADZQOL0PLBEW,B0006GVJEY,Scadhog,"[0, 0]","""A Touch of Pink"" is a charming, very funny comedy from writer/director Ian Rashid.  It is about culture clashes--gay vs. straight, modern vs. traditional--and about learning to accept one another for what they are, warts and all.The story concerns Alim (Jimi Mistri), a gay man of Muslim descent who has broken away from his family living in Canada and moved to London where he has set up house with his partner Giles (Kris Holden-Reid).  Alim's estranged mother Nuru (Suleka Mathew), unaware that her son is gay, wants him to find a nice girl (preferably a surgeon!) to settle down with.  Much to his chagrin, she travels to London to persuade him to return to Canada for his cousin's wedding.  Alim has no intentions of finding a girl or reuniting with his Canadian relatives.One of the nicest things about the movie is that, with one possible exception, there are no bad guys. Rashid gently pokes fun at all the characters, but never in a mean-spirited way.The movie is often hilarious and at times very tender.  The best sequence occurs when Giles, who appears to like Nuru better than her son does, takes her on a tour of London, getting to know her better and charming her in the process.Mistri is fine as the harried Alim.  Veena Sood is a riot as his aunt Dolly.  But the film really belongs to Mathew, who gives a superb and very funny performance as a mother who must surrender her dreams to accept her son for who he is.The only fly in the ointment here is the presence of the ghost of Cary Grant (Kyle MacLachlan), who provides guidance to Alim throughout the film.  MacLachlan gives a fine imitation of Grant, but his character is completely unnecessary and tends to get in the way of the story.  But it's a minor complaint.  It really doesn't detract from the movie too seriously.This is definitely a feel-good movie.  There is a message, but the film is never preachy.  The message of acceptance is deftly wrapped up in a thoroughly entertaining package.",5,Thoroughly entertaining comedy,1311206400,"07 21, 2011",2011,1970,"['Touch', 'Pink', 'charming', 'very', 'funny', 'comedy', 'writer/director', 'Ian', 'Rashid', 'culture', 'clashes', 'gay', 'vs.', 'straight', 'modern', 'vs.', 'traditional', 'learning', 'accept', 'one', 'what', 'are', 'warts', 'all.The', 'story', 'concerns', 'Alim', 'Jimi', 'Mistri', 'gay', 'man', 'Muslim', 'descent', 'who', 'broken', 'away', 'family', 'living', 'Canada', 'moved', 'London', 'where', 'set', 'up', 'house', 'partner', 'Giles', 'Kris', 'Holden-Reid', 'Alim', 'estranged', 'mother', 'Nuru', 'Suleka', 'Mathew', 'unaware', 'son', 'gay', 'find', 'nice', 'girl', 'preferably', 'surgeon', 'settle', 'down', 'Much', 'chagrin', 'London', 'persuade', 'return', 'Canada', 'cousin', 'wedding', 'Alim', 'intentions', 'finding', 'girl', 'reuniting', 'Canadian', 'relatives.One', 'nicest', 'things', 'movie', 'one', 'possible', 'exception', 'are', 'bad', 'guys', 'Rashid', 'gently', 'fun', 'characters', 'never', 'mean-spirited', 'way.The', 'movie', 'often', 'hilarious', 'times', 'very', 'tender', 'best', 'sequence', 'when', 'Giles', 'who', 'like', 'Nuru', 'better', 'son', 'tour', 'London', 'getting', 'know', 'better', 'charming', 'process.Mistri', 'fine', 'harried', 'Alim', 'Veena', 'Sood', 'riot', 'aunt', 'Dolly', 'film', 'really', 'Mathew', 'who', 'superb', 'very', 'funny', 'performance', 'mother', 'who', 'must', 'surrender', 'dreams', 'accept', 'son', 'who', 'only', 'fly', 'ointment', 'here', 'presence', 'ghost', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Kyle', 'MacLachlan', 'who', 'guidance', 'Alim', 'film', 'MacLachlan', 'fine', 'imitation', 'Grant', 'character', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'get', 'way', 'story', 'minor', 'complaint', 'really', ""n't"", 'detract', 'movie', 'too', 'seriously.This', 'definitely', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'message', 'film', 'never', 'preachy', 'message', 'acceptance', 'deftly', 'wrapped', 'up', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'package']",N/A
867656,A1L8HRCM60W0W7,B0006GVJEY,Shashank Tripathi,"[2, 3]","This warm little film bills itself as a comedy but does not offer much that is clever or new -- some rattletrap humour about non-resident Indians, a perky Kyle Mclachlan playing Cary Grant's spirit spewing quips in an on-screen homage to the thespian, and such.Yet, it's like that favourite dish your mom prepares when you head home for summer - not a highfalutin recipe, but its loving predictability is the very reason you want it.Several of the plot's turns and twists labor away at pat stereotypes. Jimi Mistry plays Alim, a culturally conflicted Canadian-born Indian expat living in London with his British boyfriend. They make a jovial young couple except that Alim is uptight and lives a life of carefully partitioned half-truths, having not 'come out' to his family yet, which his partner knows and humours. The crux is rooted in how Alim copes with his disconnection, his prospective arranged marriage, so forth.Mistry's rendition of a homophile is convincing; no effeminate gestures, thankfully. His British mate provides a bulk of the film's genuinely funny moments. The cardboard-cutout traditional Indian mother seems like she had her hair colored white for the role, which could be the only plausible explanation for her dramatic transformation. If only more Indian conservative types could be wrangled so.Despite its calculated proprieties, I think the film comes together well overall when all its threads collide in that inevitable Big Indian Wedding to unveil the film's main wrinkle. A good one-time watch anyway, perhaps a decent rental for a discerning evening.

The film is actually quite enjoyable as dramedy, even though it's geared towards being more of a comedy. While it's very pleasing visually, considered the production and wardrobe and music are very good, it's the main characters that make the film more affecting. I very much enjoyed the performance from Suleka Mathew who is made to look older to be Jimi Mistry's mother, and she steals the scenes effortlessly. Having worked with Canadian actor Kris Holden Reid in Never Forget(2007 release), I was quite surprised and taked by his willingness to tackle so many gay love scenes and nudity. He plays the love interest of Jimi, but his character is not so monogamous but emotionally committed. I do like his British accent, but I find his mannerism is too straight looking. That comes from Jimi Mistry as well, his appearance and portrayal is somewhat wooden and it's not the properly subtle gay, even his character is supposed to be closeted. The emotional range of his performance is there, and that was quite touching at times. Finally, I must say that while it's just a supporting role, Kyle Maclachlan did a marvellous job at impersonating Gary Grant. The voice and mannerism, plus the right makeup, hair, and wardrobe on him.
