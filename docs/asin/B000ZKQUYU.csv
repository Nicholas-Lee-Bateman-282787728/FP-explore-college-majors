1122714,AOXMWBNDZDJ9L,B000ZKQUYU,Chelsea Liddle,"[8, 8]","This is a nice collection of three different tales, with each being about 30 minutes long.  Each story starts out with a sweet lady (real action) who is writing a letter (the tale) to a child.  It appears to be England in the 19th century or early 20th century.  It's very calm, with nice music playing as she sits down to write the story.  Then the movie transitions into the cartoon which is her story.  They are all pretty cute and benign and my kids love them.",5,Sweet and calm,1296518400,"02 1, 2011",2011,464,"['nice', 'collection', 'three', 'different', 'tales', 'being', '30', 'minutes', 'long', 'story', 'out', 'sweet', 'lady', 'real', 'action', 'who', 'writing', 'letter', 'tale', 'child', 'be', 'England', '19th', 'century', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'very', 'calm', 'nice', 'music', 'playing', 'down', 'write', 'story', 'Then', 'movie', 'transitions', 'cartoon', 'story', 'are', 'pretty', 'cute', 'benign', 'kids', 'love']",The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends
1122715,AFM9DJYPNM7VT,B000ZKQUYU,"Goldencat ""Carla""","[8, 10]","I got this from the library expecting ""immature"" rendering of the story, as some cartoons are when adapted to video. I was pleased to see animals in realistic and high detail, playing true to the temperaments and quirks of their species. The gardens and woods plants were similarly well represented. The animals live in appropriate homes: Ms. Tittlemouse in a clean dry warren,the bunnies in a hill, the ducks in a farmyard.All of the animals move realistically, mostly - the kittens have a bit of trouble standing upright, and prefer to scamper on all four! The puddle ducks waddle and ""bill"" things, they do not develop fingers in their wings.The stories are told with a female narrator, who begins the tales for BBC, as if she is writing to a friend and telling her stories each time. Then the cartoon episode begins. These were a series for Tv, not one continuous movie nor steps in a series that must go in order. I like that - if I want to hear one tale, I have a complete little story beginning thru end, and it doesn't matter if I watch the rest the same day.NOTE - some liberal minded people may be offended by these stories, because they have traditional values. They portray spanking disobedient boys by a male authority figure, women as sensitive and more emotional than males, mothers and daughters in domestic roles, boys as reckless and risk-taking while girls are quiet and responsible by comparison.NOTE - these same qualities make conservative, traditional values minded folks very happy.It's wholly unlike modern cartoons, which largely portray violence, sexuality, rebellion, revenge,criminal behavior, occultism, and contempt for authority. Something to do a social studies/psych project on, hmm?Meanwhile, enjoy.",5,"excellent, lifelike animation and family values",1344470400,"08 9, 2012",2012,1734,"['got', 'library', 'expecting', 'immature', 'rendering', 'story', 'cartoons', 'are', 'when', 'adapted', 'video', 'was', 'pleased', 'see', 'animals', 'realistic', 'high', 'detail', 'playing', 'true', 'temperaments', 'quirks', 'species', 'gardens', 'woods', 'plants', 'were', 'similarly', 'well', 'represented', 'animals', 'live', 'appropriate', 'homes', 'Ms.', 'Tittlemouse', 'clean', 'dry', 'warren', 'bunnies', 'hill', 'ducks', 'farmyard.All', 'animals', 'move', 'realistically', 'mostly', 'kittens', 'have', 'bit', 'trouble', 'standing', 'upright', 'prefer', 'scamper', 'four', 'puddle', 'ducks', 'waddle', 'bill', 'things', 'do', 'not', 'develop', 'fingers', 'wings.The', 'stories', 'are', 'told', 'female', 'narrator', 'who', 'tales', 'BBC', 'writing', 'friend', 'telling', 'stories', 'time', 'Then', 'cartoon', 'episode', 'were', 'series', 'Tv', 'not', 'one', 'continuous', 'movie', 'steps', 'series', 'must', 'go', 'order', 'like', 'want', 'hear', 'one', 'tale', 'have', 'complete', 'little', 'story', 'beginning', 'thru', 'end', ""n't"", 'matter', 'watch', 'rest', 'same', 'day.NOTE', 'liberal', 'minded', 'people', 'may', 'be', 'offended', 'stories', 'have', 'traditional', 'values', 'portray', 'spanking', 'disobedient', 'boys', 'male', 'authority', 'figure', 'women', 'sensitive', 'more', 'emotional', 'males', 'mothers', 'daughters', 'domestic', 'roles', 'boys', 'reckless', 'risk-taking', 'girls', 'are', 'quiet', 'responsible', 'comparison.NOTE', 'same', 'qualities', 'make', 'conservative', 'traditional', 'values', 'minded', 'folks', 'very', 'happy.It', 'wholly', 'modern', 'cartoons', 'largely', 'portray', 'violence', 'sexuality', 'rebellion', 'revenge', 'criminal', 'behavior', 'occultism', 'contempt', 'authority', 'Something', 'do', 'social', 'studies/psych', 'project', 'hmm', 'Meanwhile', 'enjoy']",The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends

1122717,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B000ZKQUYU,Z Hayes,"[15, 15]","""The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends"" is part of The Beatrix Potter Collection (there are three DVDs in the set) and I'd advise anyone who is contemplating buying this to consider buying the entire set (which I did). All three DVDs contain the entire series of animated features based on the stories of Beatrix Potter and produced by the BBC. The animation is faithful to Ms. Potter's illustrations and everything about this production is of superior quality.Each episode is introduced by a beautiful score and a little segment featuring an actress portraying Ms. Potter going about her daily life, whether it be painting on top of a hill overlooking the scenic Lake District, posting mail, or back at home with her real-life bunny, Peter, sitting by the fireplace and sketching out something for a friend or relative (Ms. Potter was after all a great correspondent).This DVD features three episodes:The Tale of Peter Rabbit and Benjamin BunnyThe Tale of the Flopsy Bunnies and Mrs. TittlemouseThe Tale of Tom Kitten and Jemima Puddle-DuckThe episode runs 77 minutes, the aspect ratio is 4:3, is in color, and there are English subtitles for the hearing impaired.",5,Gorgeous BBC production which brings the stories of Beatrix Potter to life!,1336003200,"05 3, 2012",2012,1165,"['World', 'Peter', 'Rabbit', 'Friends', 'part', 'Beatrix', 'Potter', 'Collection', 'are', 'three', 'DVDs', 'set', ""'d"", 'advise', 'anyone', 'who', 'contemplating', 'buying', 'consider', 'buying', 'entire', 'set', 'did', 'three', 'DVDs', 'contain', 'entire', 'series', 'animated', 'features', 'based', 'stories', 'Beatrix', 'Potter', 'produced', 'BBC', 'animation', 'faithful', 'Ms.', 'Potter', 'illustrations', 'everything', 'production', 'superior', 'quality.Each', 'episode', 'introduced', 'beautiful', 'score', 'little', 'segment', 'featuring', 'actress', 'portraying', 'Ms.', 'Potter', 'going', 'daily', 'life', 'be', 'painting', 'top', 'hill', 'overlooking', 'scenic', 'Lake', 'District', 'posting', 'mail', 'back', 'home', 'real-life', 'bunny', 'Peter', 'sitting', 'fireplace', 'sketching', 'out', 'something', 'friend', 'relative', 'Ms.', 'Potter', 'was', 'great', 'correspondent', 'DVD', 'features', 'three', 'episodes', 'Tale', 'Peter', 'Rabbit', 'Benjamin', 'BunnyThe', 'Tale', 'Flopsy', 'Bunnies', 'Mrs.', 'TittlemouseThe', 'Tale', 'Tom', 'Kitten', 'Jemima', 'Puddle-DuckThe', 'episode', '77', 'minutes', 'aspect', 'ratio', '4:3', 'color', 'are', 'English', 'subtitles', 'hearing', 'impaired']",The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends
