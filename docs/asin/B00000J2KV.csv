Stiff and charming and doomed all at the same time, he conveys his characters' feelings perfectly.Shelly Winters is an absolute riot and adds all the spunk and humor to the first part of the film.Peter Sellers works in some great lines as the pathetic Quilty, and Sue Lyons; well, she's not much of an actress, and she's a tad too old for the part.But the age gap is hardly noticeable, and one doesn't need to be much of an actress in order to convey the part of Lolita-she's more like a backdrop to the movie than an actual character. Yes, things get a bit drab in the end-the movie is certainly a whole lot more fun and irresistable in the beginning,due partly to the presence of Shelly Winters. And this film lacks the emotional impact, although I'm pretty sure it was intended as more of a dark comedy than a drama.I don't think this movie is worthy of classic status or anything, but it's quite a great film.It's got great performances, and the script is absolute perfection,a marvel, I can't tell you how good it is(written by Nabokov himself).It's definately worth a watch, whatever your tastes.Don't expect to be blown away, but do expect to be fairly pleased, as all in all, this is a fine film.And if you're really,really curious, well then read the novel, which is more dense and difficult than one would imagine.",4,Pretty great,1083369600,"05 1, 2004",2004,1633,"['Do', 'favor-and', 'see', 'version', 'Lolita', 'ever', 'do', 'get', 'watching', '1997', 'film.This', 'movie', 'novel', 'essence', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'not', 'mention', 'superbly', 'acted', 'written', 'array', 'great', 'scenes.James', 'Mason', 'wonderful', 'Humbert', 'Humbert', 'Stiff', 'charming', 'doomed', 'same', 'time', 'conveys', 'characters', 'feelings', 'perfectly.Shelly', 'Winters', 'absolute', 'riot', 'spunk', 'humor', 'first', 'part', 'film.Peter', 'Sellers', 'great', 'lines', 'pathetic', 'Quilty', 'Sue', 'Lyons', 'well', 'not', 'much', 'actress', 'tad', 'too', 'old', 'part.But', 'age', 'gap', 'hardly', 'noticeable', 'one', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'much', 'actress', 'order', 'convey', 'part', 'Lolita-she', 'more', 'backdrop', 'movie', 'actual', 'character', 'Yes', 'things', 'get', 'bit', 'drab', 'end-the', 'movie', 'certainly', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'fun', 'irresistable', 'beginning', 'due', 'partly', 'presence', 'Shelly', 'Winters', 'film', 'emotional', 'impact', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'was', 'intended', 'more', 'dark', 'comedy', 'drama.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'worthy', 'classic', 'status', 'anything', 'quite', 'great', 'film.It', 'got', 'great', 'performances', 'script', 'absolute', 'perfection', 'marvel', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'how', 'good', 'written', 'Nabokov', '.It', 'definately', 'watch', 'tastes.Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'blown', 'away', 'do', 'expect', 'be', 'fairly', 'pleased', 'fine', 'film.And', ""'re"", 'really', 'really', 'curious', 'well', 'then', 'read', 'novel', 'more', 'dense', 'difficult', 'one', 'would', 'imagine']",N/A

A very outdated film considered today's standards of love scenes between middle-aged men and the young girls they fall for. The film is in black and white, it's a great looking film, beautifully shot by Kubrick, I never read the book but hope to soon. Shelly Winters is wonderful and completely real as the mother of Lolita. She is so desperate to keep her writer hubby eyes away from her ""precious"" 16 year-old. Lolita is a very curious, manipulative, confused girl. I truly believe Lolita seduces Humbert and not the other way around.

505641,ADBEG8PLO3OMC,B00000J2KV,"A. Johnson ""Jason Hex""","[0, 1]","As the theatrical trailer reminds us, making a movie of Lolita in the early 60s was a well-nigh impossible gesture. Nabokov's novel, with all its byzantine word games, centers on the ultimate taboo: Child  rape. It's a tribute to Nabokov's genius that his point-of-view character, chief protagonist Humbert  Humbert (the unnatural redundancy of the name suggests incest, among other things) can court our  sympathies with  any degree of success. He's a pathetic, cowardly monster who kidnaps and rapes his own stepdaughter and holds her hostage to his desires until she escapes from him. Yet his ardor  for the beloved 'nymphet,' with all its accompanying jealousy, possessiveness and the downright terror of her falling into the hands of teenage boys, says something  profound about the irrational  nature of love. When Lolita finally slips from his clutches, it's the body following the illusion Humbert has created; he never legitimately had her/owned her, but neither does any  lover, ultimately.Stanley Kubrick's film of Lolita is not the novel, as the most helpful positive reviewer points out. It simply couldn't have been done at the time, but neither does Adrian  Lynne's  1998 adaptation do it justice (I  suspect that no  one, not even a latter-day Luis Bunuel, could make the ""real"" Lolita, with  all of its hall-of-mirrors splendor intact). But  considering the limitations involved, Kubrick's is a marvelous work. Using a sublime cast--Peter Sellers steals the show as Quilty, James Mason is wonderfully Humbertian, and Sue Lyons is a convincingly vulgar childish  enticement--and working from Nabokov's  own  script, Kubrick delicately cuts  the outline of monstrosity from symbolism, clues  and  cues to the actual evil at hand that range from the subtle to the hilariously overt (Lolita attends something called  Camp Climax; Humbert  refers to the Dairy Queen  as the Frigid Queen, with all the Freudian matter  that conveys). For all the  talk of Kubrick's formalism  he can be very funny, and his film of Lolita has slapstick qualities to rival Buster Keaton, along  with  all the droll suggestions of naughtiness  indicated above. A very enjoyable film and one that bears repeated viewing.",5,"Not ""the"" Lolita, but a Brilliant Lolita nonetheless",1206403200,"03 25, 2008",2008,2210,"['theatrical', 'trailer', 'making', 'movie', 'Lolita', 'early', '60s', 'was', 'well-nigh', 'impossible', 'gesture', 'Nabokov', 'novel', 'byzantine', 'word', 'games', 'centers', 'ultimate', 'taboo', 'Child', 'rape', 'tribute', 'Nabokov', 'genius', 'point-of-view', 'character', 'chief', 'protagonist', 'Humbert', 'Humbert', 'unnatural', 'redundancy', 'name', 'incest', 'other', 'things', 'can', 'court', 'sympathies', 'degree', 'success', 'pathetic', 'cowardly', 'monster', 'who', 'rapes', 'own', 'stepdaughter', 'hostage', 'desires', 'ardor', 'beloved', ""'nymphet"", 'accompanying', 'jealousy', 'possessiveness', 'downright', 'terror', 'falling', 'hands', 'teenage', 'boys', 'something', 'profound', 'irrational', 'nature', 'love', 'When', 'Lolita', 'finally', 'clutches', 'body', 'following', 'illusion', 'Humbert', 'created', 'never', 'legitimately', 'had', 'her/owned', 'neither', 'lover', 'ultimately.Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'film', 'Lolita', 'not', 'novel', 'most', 'helpful', 'positive', 'reviewer', 'points', 'out', 'simply', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'done', 'time', 'neither', 'Adrian', 'Lynne', '1998', 'adaptation', 'do', 'justice', 'suspect', 'one', 'not', 'even', 'latter-day', 'Luis', 'Bunuel', 'could', 'make', 'real', 'Lolita', 'hall-of-mirrors', 'splendor', 'intact', 'considering', 'limitations', 'involved', 'Kubrick', 'marvelous', 'work', 'Using', 'sublime', 'cast', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'show', 'Quilty', 'James', 'Mason', 'wonderfully', 'Humbertian', 'Sue', 'Lyons', 'convincingly', 'vulgar', 'childish', 'enticement', 'working', 'Nabokov', 'own', 'script', 'Kubrick', 'delicately', 'outline', 'monstrosity', 'symbolism', 'clues', 'cues', 'actual', 'evil', 'hand', 'range', 'subtle', 'hilariously', 'overt', 'Lolita', 'something', 'called', 'Camp', 'Climax', 'Humbert', 'refers', 'Dairy', 'Queen', 'Frigid', 'Queen', 'Freudian', 'matter', 'conveys', 'talk', 'Kubrick', 'formalism', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'funny', 'film', 'Lolita', 'slapstick', 'qualities', 'rival', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'droll', 'suggestions', 'naughtiness', 'indicated', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'one', 'repeated', 'viewing']",N/A

Having read the novel as an assignment in College, I thought this movie was going to be as obscene as the novel (without downplaying the book, I mean only the lustful utterances by the character Humbert Humbert).Kubrick cleverly builds up the sexual tension between Humbert Humbert and Lolita, while Charlotte Haze blinded by her mature age and her need for finding a man for herself, does not pay attention to the evident lust of  Humbert Humbert for her daughter, and the flirtings of her precocious child.There is a big lesson in this movie and one that Humbert Humbert fails to pay attention to: 'The universe does not revolve around you.' And when he realizes of it, Lolita has already fled away after having held a secret affair with Quilty (Peter Sellers), who turns out to be a stalking, deceiving man, a person much more dangerous than Humbert Humbert himself, the one we thought as the sexual predator, but who, at the end of the story is revealed to be just a pathetic sick man.What could have been a very nasty movie, and surely cut, or even prohibited by censors (the sexual situations are just insinuated), is instead a drama seasoned with comical overtones, like when in the motel, Humbert Humbert and the valet are trying to deploy the collapsible bed, while Lolita sleeps.As a sidenote, I wish that Stanley Kubrick and Peter Sellers could have worked together in more projects, Peter Sellers is great in both Lolita & Dr. Strangelove; surely Peters Sellers has been of the best actors in the history of cinematography.While in the novel, Vladimir Nabokov kills all the 'sinners' in his story (Lolita dies during childbirth), here in Kubrick's Lolita, she survives.Do not be scared away by the classification of this movie as an Art Movie or Cult Classic, Stanley Kubrick didn't shoot his movies for an elite of intellectuals, but for all of us who enjoy a good story.",5,A good movie adaptation of a controversial novel.,1162771200,"11 6, 2006",2006,2047,"['Lolita', 'based', 'controversial', 'novel', 'Vladimir', 'Nabokov', 'who', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'Kubrick', 'disregarded', 'read', 'Wikipedia', 'Having', 'read', 'novel', 'assignment', 'College', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'as', 'obscene', 'novel', 'downplaying', 'book', 'mean', 'only', 'lustful', 'utterances', 'character', 'Humbert', 'Humbert', '.Kubrick', 'cleverly', 'builds', 'up', 'sexual', 'tension', 'Humbert', 'Humbert', 'Lolita', 'Charlotte', 'Haze', 'blinded', 'mature', 'age', 'need', 'finding', 'man', 'not', 'pay', 'attention', 'evident', 'lust', 'Humbert', 'Humbert', 'daughter', 'flirtings', 'precocious', 'child.There', 'big', 'lesson', 'movie', 'one', 'Humbert', 'Humbert', 'pay', 'attention', ""'The"", 'universe', 'not', 'revolve', 'when', 'Lolita', 'already', 'fled', 'away', 'having', 'held', 'secret', 'affair', 'Quilty', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'stalking', 'deceiving', 'man', 'person', 'much', 'more', 'dangerous', 'Humbert', 'Humbert', 'one', 'thought', 'sexual', 'predator', 'who', 'end', 'story', 'revealed', 'be', 'just', 'pathetic', 'sick', 'man.What', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'nasty', 'movie', 'surely', 'cut', 'even', 'prohibited', 'censors', 'sexual', 'situations', 'are', 'just', 'insinuated', 'instead', 'drama', 'seasoned', 'comical', 'overtones', 'when', 'motel', 'Humbert', 'Humbert', 'valet', 'are', 'trying', 'deploy', 'collapsible', 'bed', 'Lolita', 'sleeps.As', 'sidenote', 'wish', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'could', 'have', 'worked', 'together', 'more', 'projects', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'great', 'Lolita', 'Dr.', 'Strangelove', 'surely', 'Peters', 'Sellers', 'been', 'best', 'actors', 'history', 'cinematography.While', 'novel', 'Vladimir', 'Nabokov', ""'sinners"", 'story', 'Lolita', 'childbirth', 'here', 'Kubrick', 'Lolita', 'survives.Do', 'not', 'be', 'scared', 'away', 'classification', 'movie', 'Art', 'Movie', 'Cult', 'Classic', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'did', ""n't"", 'shoot', 'movies', 'elite', 'intellectuals', 'who', 'enjoy', 'good', 'story']",N/A

One needy, insistent lady attempts to lure him into her home, but Humbert is resistant to her offers--until he sees her 15 year old daughter, Lolita . . . one thing leads to another, Humbert marries Lolita's mother in order to get close to Lolita, and he writes about his secret, tortured passions in his diary. Meanwhile, the TV writer Clare Quilty has also set his sights on Lolita, and is aware of Humbert's infatuation for her. This will bode ill for the future of all three of them, especially for the jealous, conflicted, and pathetic Humbert.I have not read Vladimir Nabokov's novel Lolita, so I have no point of comparison with it as I watched the film. Reportedly, though the screenplay is credited to Nabokov himself, Kubrick used relatively little of it as he adapted it for the screen. The result is a mixed bag. James Mason's performance as Humbert is outstanding--he captures the outwardly civilized, tormented, and unsavory nature of Humbert Humbert very well, with his dapper accent and body language. Shelley Winters also does a fine job portraying Humbert's shrewish wife, though the character is a bit one-dimensional. Sue Lyons, who plays Lolita, does not fare so well, though this is in part to her seeming too old to be a nymphet; she acts the part of a bratty late teenager than of someone who is just entering adolescence. Also, Kubrick's plan was to turn this moral tragedy into a kind of black comedy, which is why Peter Sellers (as Clare Quilty) shows up and tries to leaven the atmosphere. While Sellers is great at doing impressions, especially of the German Freudian psychiatrist, his performance feels out of place in a film that should be more about Humbert's internal conflicts. (When put in the right context, as in Dr. Strangelove, Sellers shines very brightly indeed.) Also, I'm not sure the circular structure of the film is necessary or effective, as all it did was to confuse me initially. The cinematography is not of particular note, which is a bit unusual for a Kubrick film, though the overall direction is tight and Kubrick already shows a mastery of rendering interior conflict and character without being too overt or obvious. (Lolita, in fact, is one of his most character-oriented films, debunking the idea that he prefers machines to humans or that his films are cold and lifeless.) But this early effort, while smooth and watchable, feels coy and underdeveloped, perhaps because of the censorship of the era, perhaps because Nabokov's book is inherently unfilmable--whatever the reason, Kubrick would go on to do greater work.",3,"An Underdeveloped ""Lolita""",1047600000,"03 14, 2003",2003,2723,"['Humbert', 'Humbert', 'European', 'literary', 'scholar', 'place', 'stay', 'summer', 'teaching', 'position', 'Ohio', 'college', 'One', 'needy', 'insistent', 'lady', 'attempts', 'lure', 'home', 'Humbert', 'resistant', 'offers', '15', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'Lolita', 'one', 'thing', 'Humbert', 'Lolita', 'mother', 'order', 'get', 'close', 'Lolita', 'secret', 'tortured', 'passions', 'diary', 'Meanwhile', 'TV', 'writer', 'Clare', 'Quilty', 'also', 'set', 'sights', 'Lolita', 'aware', 'Humbert', 'infatuation', 'will', 'bode', 'ill', 'future', 'three', 'especially', 'jealous', 'conflicted', 'pathetic', 'Humbert.I', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'Vladimir', 'Nabokov', 'novel', 'Lolita', 'so', 'have', 'point', 'comparison', 'watched', 'film', 'Reportedly', 'screenplay', 'credited', 'Nabokov', 'Kubrick', 'used', 'relatively', 'little', 'adapted', 'screen', 'result', 'mixed', 'bag', 'James', 'Mason', 'performance', 'Humbert', 'outstanding', 'outwardly', 'civilized', 'tormented', 'unsavory', 'nature', 'Humbert', 'Humbert', 'very', 'well', 'dapper', 'accent', 'body', 'language', 'Shelley', 'Winters', 'also', 'fine', 'job', 'portraying', 'Humbert', 'shrewish', 'wife', 'character', 'bit', 'one-dimensional', 'Sue', 'Lyons', 'who', 'Lolita', 'not', 'fare', 'so', 'well', 'part', 'seeming', 'too', 'old', 'be', 'nymphet', 'part', 'bratty', 'late', 'teenager', 'someone', 'who', 'just', 'entering', 'adolescence', 'Also', 'Kubrick', 'plan', 'was', 'turn', 'moral', 'tragedy', 'kind', 'black', 'comedy', 'why', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'Clare', 'Quilty', 'up', 'tries', 'leaven', 'atmosphere', 'Sellers', 'great', 'doing', 'impressions', 'especially', 'German', 'Freudian', 'psychiatrist', 'performance', 'place', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'Humbert', 'internal', 'conflicts', 'When', 'put', 'right', 'context', 'Dr.', 'Strangelove', 'Sellers', 'very', 'brightly', 'indeed', 'Also', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'circular', 'structure', 'film', 'necessary', 'effective', 'did', 'was', 'confuse', 'initially', 'cinematography', 'not', 'particular', 'note', 'bit', 'unusual', 'Kubrick', 'film', 'overall', 'direction', 'tight', 'Kubrick', 'already', 'mastery', 'rendering', 'interior', 'conflict', 'character', 'being', 'too', 'overt', 'obvious', 'Lolita', 'fact', 'one', 'most', 'character-oriented', 'films', 'debunking', 'idea', 'machines', 'humans', 'films', 'are', 'cold', 'lifeless', 'early', 'effort', 'smooth', 'watchable', 'feels', 'coy', 'underdeveloped', 'perhaps', 'censorship', 'era', 'perhaps', 'Nabokov', 'book', 'inherently', 'unfilmable', 'reason', 'Kubrick', 'would', 'go', 'do', 'greater', 'work']",N/A
505645,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00000J2KV,Andrew Ellington,"[5, 7]","The opening scene of `Lolita' is flawless, utterly flawless.  In fact, it may be one of my favorite movie sequences of all time, flaunting one of my favorite supporting performances of all time; Peter Sellers' Clare Quincy.  Sellers marvelously uses his wit and humor to draw us into his character and create a bond with us, wetting our appetite as to what he is really all about.  As he staggers from side to side and attempts to humor his unexpected guest we find ourselves fully embraced by this film and completely ready to delve right into Kubrick's vision.Many have baulked at that said vision, claiming that it strays to far from Vladimar Nabokov's scandalous novel.  I personally have never read the novel (I really should now) and so I cannot comment on that regard, but Kubrick has been known for his personal interpretation of his source material so it doesn't surprise me.  I personally was recently called out for judging a film based on its source material and was told, and I quote:""This review is not a film review; it is a disappointed review from a reader that can't distinguish the art of movies from the art of literature.""I want to address this subject since Kubrick is the master of making each and every movie his own vision versus that of the original author or materials.  The reason I criticized that particular film (`Less than Zero' for anyone wondering) was that is veered so much from the original text that it dumbed down the authors initial concept and created a generic film about drug addiction that did nothing to distinguish itself as important or vital.  It took the authors marvelous concept and delivery and muddled it with clich&eacute;s and in the end created a film void of any real substance.  The difference between a film like that and anything Kubrick has made is that, while he may veer from the original intended impact the source material conveyed he always creates a film filled to the brim with substance and vision and thus creates a film that is socially important.  Just look at what he did with `A Clockwork Orange' or `The Shining'.  He may have strayed from the authors originally penned words, but he never extracted true meaning and emotional impact from his work.  Both films are marvelous examples of inspired vision.That said, `Lolita' does not disappoint in remaining true to Kubrick's style and vision.The story follows Professor Humbert Humbert as he entertains his dangerous attraction to the underage Lolita.  Humbert first meets Lolita when he is being shown a room within her mothers home he is planning on renting.  It is the sight of the beautiful blonde that seals the deal and convinces Humbert to rent the room.  Despite his lusting for Lolita, it is her mother Charlotte that desires to have her way with Humbert, and eventually Humbert gives in to her advances if only to have more time to spend with Lolita.I was shocked in the route Kubrick went with the film, straddling the edges of a black comedy as apposed to embracing the film as a serious and dramatic adult film.  I only had the synopsis and the many years of hearing the term `Lolita' thrown around as a backdrop so I was expecting a much darker film.  What I got though was an entertaining look at the amusing side of the male psyche.When you think about Humbert's situation, it is not as far fetched and or `scandalous' as one may initially conclude.  While yes, his eventual `relationship' with Lolita is illegal and morally repulsive his initial attraction is not that uncommon for men of his age and even younger.  She is a pretty young girl who is obviously mature for her age and is flirtatious beyond her years; whether out of spite for her mother or out of repressed urges caused by the loss of a father in such a dramatic way.  Nevertheless, her advances towards Humbert, no matter how subtle, no doubt would draw his attention towards those not-so-grey areas in life.  What `Lolita' shows is the danger in succumbing to those human desires and the aftereffect that it has on a man's soul.  As Humbert dives into a relationship with Lolita he becomes raked with guilt and insecurities as he struggles to keep Lolita to himself despite her obvious desire to be free of him.  Watching Humbert slowly fray until he becomes a panicked skeleton of his former self is both humorous as well as alarming.  His obsession consumes and in the end controls him to the point where he is a slave to his own pagan desires even though he knows they are morally corrupt.I think the biggest reason this `comical' approach works is that it manages to humanize the situation as apposed to over dramatize it.  Sometimes when a film takes a very dramatic approach to a subject such as this one it can come across almost otherworldly, as if the situation were so horrible it could never happen.  The approach taken here helps the audience to see that this is more common than one may want to admit.The film, and Kubrick's vision, are pushed along by some very strong performances, most notably that of Peter Sellers who plays Clare Quincy, Humbert's rival.  Sellers has often been lauded as the king of comedy and so it is not too farfetched to conclude that he would be the comical highlight of the film.  His opening scene along is marvelously constructed.  Like I said; one of the greatest supporting performances of all time.  Shelley Winters is also extremely memorable and utterly hysterical as Charlotte.  Her performance solidifies her as one of the greats and really defines her characters desperations beautifully.The two main stars really had to sell this though, and so without the dedication of both James Mason and Sue Lyon `Lolita' would have fallen flat.  Mason comes off a tad boring during the first half of the film, but as his characters obsessions get the better of him it becomes apparent that that `boringness' was necessary to creating the needed effect of a mind gone mad.  He was just a normal guy who lost it because of the passions of a young girl.  Sue Lyon is very effective as Lolita.  From her first scene we can tell that she is extremely desirable.  For a young actress (and a debut performance at that) she really holds her own amongst the cast and does a very fine job of making Humbert Humbert relatable, because truth-be-told, we want her as much as he does.In the end I must call `Lolita' yet another Kubrick masterpiece.  It is far from what I expected but in the end it manages to exceed my expectations because it became something so much more than a generic drama.  Kubrick is nothing short of a genius, and this film fits beautifully in his catalog of marvelous cinematic gems.",5,A humorous look at a very human obsession...,1212624000,"06 5,

Kubrick took his own cool and darkly comic view of the novel's theme and  turned it into a compelling movie which must be seen.Of course, Sue  Lyons is not the Lolita of the novel. But who could have been? Perhaps  Natalie Portman, if she'd been around at the time, could have made a  credible stab at this difficult role. But in the end, that doesn't matter.  Lolita exists as a tortured figure in James Mason's Humbertish mind -- she  is a cypher, and we see her through his lustful, craving eyes. We really do  not need to see Lolita at all -- just study James Mason's reactions. His  acting is the high-point of the film. Select Chapter 14 of the DVD to watch  him read his landlady's declaration of love. Watch and listen to him  laughing with evil glee as he reads her confession. It's a macabre  performance to enjoy forever.The recent Adrian Lyne film of Lolita was  fine in its own very different way, and more faithful to the novel.

Thanks to his review there is not much else one can add except to give two points to illustrate just why this piece of cinema fails so terribly to hit the mark.Nabokov's novel is a simply astounding pieces of fiction, a fact which is neither subjective, nor objective but simply the truth. It is a complex, beautiful, passionate, romantic and obsessive tale that should leave the reader enthralled from cover to cover. One is naturally compelled to wonder then, why notions pertaining to the above adjectives have been entirely omitted from the film? Furthermore it seems somewhat sadly ironic that Nabokov himself had a hand in this butchery. This is the most serious point of contention and thus the first point of failure, the old battle revisited about novels versus films. Those arguments however, are usually a matter of mere subjective preference not as in this case where it is a matter of sad fact. Contrasting the novel and the moving form, the biggest and most unforgiving err. has to be the lack of passion in the film. The book oozes passion, whereas the film is totally frigid.The second point of contention is the 'acting', and you notice I place the word in inverted-commas. Except for Peter Sellers who earned his money, what we are presented with is amateur dramatics of the 'village-hall' variety. Imagine one of those awful Quentin Tarentino cameos, running for 2 hours! and you might have an idea of this film I know these people were 'names' but clearly Kubrick was taking a laissez faire approach on this one. Their performances (and by they I mean the ENTIRE cast) are thin, stilted, formulaic, un-eloquent and bland. I found it very challenging to keep watching. In fact the performances were so wooden one could be forgiven for thinking one had flipped channels and was now watching a documentary about the Canadian lumber industry.I would argue that there are three pieces of modern fiction everyone ought to read - i) Lolita, ii) Animal Farm & iii) Catcher in the Rye. For good reasons these three novels are considered modern classics. What though if one desires to make a film of one of them - that is they go ahead and use the same name - so not a film 'based upon' nor 'inspired by' but a film bearing the name of the original work of fiction. If one did that shouldn't the film draw from that which made the novel great? The lesson there is of course to pick up the book and get the full and glorious effect of Nabokov's mellifluous tongue. If though you have done that and you still want to watch a cinematic adaptation, then go ahead and watch director Adrian Lyne's 1998 version, which is all together a much better film.",1,Lolita?,1145491200,"04 20, 2006",2006,2755,"['Firstly', 'one', 'should', 'credit', 'Amazon', 'having', 'good', 'sense', 'quote', 'Dave', 'McCoy', 'main', 'page', 'Thanks', 'review', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'one', 'can', 'add', 'give', 'two', 'points', 'illustrate', 'just', 'why', 'piece', 'cinema', 'fails', 'so', 'terribly', 'hit', 'mark.Nabokov', 'novel', 'simply', 'astounding', 'pieces', 'fiction', 'fact', 'subjective', 'objective', 'simply', 'truth', 'complex', 'beautiful', 'passionate', 'romantic', 'obsessive', 'tale', 'should', 'leave', 'reader', 'enthralled', 'cover', 'cover', 'One', 'naturally', 'compelled', 'wonder', 'then', 'why', 'notions', 'pertaining', 'above', 'adjectives', 'have', 'been', 'entirely', 'omitted', 'film', 'somewhat', 'sadly', 'ironic', 'Nabokov', 'had', 'hand', 'butchery', 'most', 'serious', 'point', 'contention', 'thus', 'first', 'point', 'failure', 'old', 'battle', 'revisited', 'novels', 'versus', 'films', 'arguments', 'however', 'are', 'usually', 'matter', 'mere', 'subjective', 'preference', 'not', 'case', 'where', 'matter', 'sad', 'fact', 'Contrasting', 'novel', 'moving', 'form', 'biggest', 'most', 'unforgiving', 'err', 'be', 'lack', 'passion', 'film', 'book', 'passion', 'film', 'totally', 'frigid.The', 'second', 'point', 'contention', ""'acting"", 'notice', 'place', 'word', 'inverted-commas', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'who', 'earned', 'money', 'what', 'are', 'presented', 'amateur', 'dramatics', ""'village-hall"", 'variety', 'Imagine', 'one', 'awful', 'Quentin', 'Tarentino', 'cameos', 'running', '2', 'hours', 'might', 'have', 'idea', 'film', 'know', 'people', 'were', ""'names"", 'clearly', 'Kubrick', 'was', 'taking', 'laissez', 'faire', 'approach', 'one', 'performances', 'mean', 'ENTIRE', 'cast', 'are', 'thin', 'stilted', 'formulaic', 'un-eloquent', 'bland', 'found', 'very', 'challenging', 'keep', 'watching', 'fact', 'performances', 'were', 'so', 'wooden', 'one', 'could', 'be', 'forgiven', 'thinking', 'one', 'had', 'flipped', 'channels', 'was', 'now', 'watching', 'documentary', 'Canadian', 'lumber', 'industry.I', 'would', 'argue', 'are', 'three', 'pieces', 'modern', 'fiction', 'everyone', 'ought', 'read', 'i', 'Lolita', 'ii', 'Animal', 'Farm', 'iii', 'Catcher', 'Rye', 'good', 'reasons', 'three', 'novels', 'are', 'considered', 'modern', 'classics', 'What', 'one', 'make', 'film', 'one', 'go', 'ahead', 'use', 'same', 'name', 'so', 'not', 'film', ""'based"", ""'inspired"", 'film', 'bearing', 'name', 'original', 'work', 'fiction', 'one', 'did', 'should', ""n't"", 'film', 'draw', 'made', 'novel', 'great', 'lesson', 'course', 'pick', 'up', 'book', 'get', 'full', 'glorious', 'effect', 'Nabokov', 'mellifluous', 'tongue', 'have', 'done', 'still', 'want', 'watch', 'cinematic', 'adaptation', 'then', 'go', 'ahead', 'watch', 'director', 'Adrian', 'Lyne', '1998', 'version', 'together', 'much', 'better', 'film']",N/A

Well, nah...Stanley Kubrick misses the target on this one by a mile since he fails to focus what was so darned taboo about the relationship between Humbert and Lolita. Of course, admittedly, Sue Lyon isn't a looker and is more of an annoying, whiny older girl than her supposed character's age. So, that undermines her as a likeable femme fatale. Really, what Lolita should be focused on the most is James Mason. He was extraordinarily brilliant, and the study of his slowly going from sensible, morally repressive to insane, infatuated lovesick of a performance is a work of art. Everything else is secondary. It's quite hard for me to believe in the subplots such as the ones with Peter Sellers and the suspicions aroused by others. I find that annoying and too good to be true. They have hurt the film as whole. But Peter Sellers, man...do I ever hate him. Watching him felt like the movie was being in under his control, and his controlling drew too much unnecessary attention onto him. He truly killed the scenes that he was in. Watching James Mason getting soured by his presence said it all for me. On the other hand, Sue Lyon...jeez, I really need to be convinced that she is worth it. She reminds me a lot of girls I used to know; those types who seem have absolute no awareness that there is a real world that revolves around their crappy existence they call life. Watching her to hoard and gallop on the junk food has me thinking of the actress/actor Divine. Shelley Winters played her part (perhaps too much of Elizabeth Taylor of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? in her) although she was as annoying as Peter Sellers, but still, she was a necessary component to the story. After she died, the movie practically started. I am willing to accept the premise, although very limited, behind the film because it's very interesting to see how James Mason acts. There are some good and some bad about Lolita, but primarily, I only will see the movie again for James Mason. Meanwhile, I hardly see anything so controversial about the movie; if it was the actual father of the girl, then I can see where this is going. Kubrick did a better job with Eyes Wide Shut as he explores the topic much better and more thoroughly than he does for Lolita.

The daughter's name is ""Lolita,"" and Stanley Kubrick's film. loosely based on Vladimir Nabokov's controversial novel, starts off with a literal bang as the oddly named professor, obsessed with the title nymphet, guns down the eccentric playwright who initiated the willing Lolita into the ways of the flesh, and later blew the whistle on the professor for his pedophilia.This very odd and lengthy film is exquisitely cast with James Mason as the professor and Sue Lyon as Lolita each scoring a bulls-eye. Mason wonderfully displays the humiliation that Humbert suffers as his dignified exterior crumbles away to reveal the pathetic soul underneath. Lyon is perfect as the nymphet, still cracking gum and blowing bubbles while luring men with her womanly charms. Shelley Winters as her mother, the woman Humbert marries only to possess her daughter, is their match.Unfortunately, Peter Sellers as the playwright is a bit of a disappointment, ably conveying the odd quality of his character, but failing to suggest the ""genius"" that Lolita attributes to him. Perhaps Lolita was still too immature to distinguish between genius and a nut case.

Deciding to start afresh in a small town in New Hampshire, he inquires at the house of the floozy Charlotte Haze (Shelley Winters - THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE, WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH HELEN?) about the possibility of renting her spare room.  The clinch to the deal according to Humbert is Charlotte's beautiful young daughter with the &quot;lovely, lyrical, lilting name&quot; - Lolita (Sue Lyon).Soon Humbert and Charlotte are married but he still feels very attracted to young Lolita.  After Charlotte convieniently gets run over and killed by a car, Humbert takes Lolita and starts again in another town.

But this is really inferior, despite the fact a genius like Kubrick directed it. The high point of the film is *not* Peter  Sellers, who is rather irritating here, but James Mason, who makes the  perfect Humbert. If you read Nabokov's physical description of Humbert in  the novel, Mason fits it to a &quot;T&quot; except he's slightly older than  the actual character.Sue Lyons is ridiculously &quot;old&quot; to play  the part of a 12 year old nymphet. Lyons was 17 when filming began and  looks every inch of it. Her perforance is surprisingly good considering her  inexperience and the fact she never played a decent role after this one.  Shelly Winters, as the sex-starved wife of Mason, is perfectly cast.

I was soon shocked by the ""love story"" it tells and I was subsequently drawn into the film completely.  It is a mark of all of Kubrick's films that, while they may shock and disturb the audience, it is impossible to take your eyes off the screen.  LOLITA is no exception.  I should have known.  The screenplay was written by Vladimir Nabokov, whose novel PALE FIRE also captivated my imagination some years ago, and he certainly knows how to explore the depths of human emotion.  This story is rather ""on the edge"": a middle-aged professor becomes obsessed with his daughter's landlord.  What's the problem?  Well...the daughter isn't even in high school yet.Kubrick handles the subject matter with great subtlety.  By today's standards, there is nothing really objectionable in this film (at least visually).  None of the ""intimate"" scenes are graphic and everything is expressed through innuendo and suggestion.  Yet, the film still manages to upset audiences.  Kubrick's portrayal is enough to make audiences squirm in their seats, even though Lolita (Sue Lyons) is far too old for the part and is somewhat convincing as a tease and suitable object of sexual desire.  I found out that in the novel Lolita is even younger than seen here.  What makes LOLITA powerful is the fact that the young girl is not entirely the victim.  She is a girl fully aware of her power over men and uses this power to great effect.  We squirm because we are not accustomed to seeing a young teenager playing the role of Cleopatra.However, I was not thrilled with the entire film.  I think that all of the scenes with Clare Quilty (Peter Sellers) are simply confusing, probably given the fact that this is a film and not the novel.  Quilty's motivations are never clearly revealed and he seems rather willing to chase Lolita and Professor Humbert around for the sole purpose of ending Humbert's dreams and ending the movie.  I have to imagine that we are granted a much fuller account of his psychology in the novel.  Additionally, the opening sequence (in which Sellers talent is quite apparent) seems awkward and contrived by the end.James Mason's performance is incredible in this film.  He truly becomes his part, conveying his twisted desire without exception.  We do not get caught up in his reasoning, nor are we asked to feel sympathy for him.  His part fails to gain sympathy.  Instead, we are asked to sort out the ethical mess he has made.  In the end, LOLITA is a fascinating film and I highly recommend it.  Though, you may want to put smaller children out of the room before you press ""play.""",4,A Shocking & Subtle Exploration of Adult/Child Relations,1131580800,"11 10, 2005",2005,2645,"['came', 'LOLITA', 'idea', 'subject', 'matter', 'was', 'soon', 'shocked', 'love', 'story', 'was', 'subsequently', 'drawn', 'film', 'completely', 'mark', 'Kubrick', 'films', 'may', 'shock', 'disturb', 'audience', 'impossible', 'take', 'eyes', 'screen', 'LOLITA', 'exception', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'screenplay', 'was', 'written', 'Vladimir', 'Nabokov', 'novel', 'PALE', 'FIRE', 'also', 'captivated', 'imagination', 'years', 'ago', 'certainly', 'how', 'explore', 'depths', 'human', 'emotion', 'story', 'rather', 'edge', 'middle-aged', 'professor', 'becomes', 'obsessed', 'daughter', 'landlord', 'What', 'problem', 'Well', 'daughter', ""n't"", 'even', 'high', 'school', 'yet.Kubrick', 'subject', 'matter', 'great', 'subtlety', 'today', 'standards', 'nothing', 'really', 'objectionable', 'film', 'least', 'visually', 'None', 'intimate', 'scenes', 'are', 'graphic', 'everything', 'expressed', 'innuendo', 'suggestion', 'film', 'still', 'upset', 'audiences', 'Kubrick', 'portrayal', 'enough', 'make', 'audiences', 'squirm', 'seats', 'even', 'Lolita', 'Sue', 'Lyons', 'far', 'too', 'old', 'part', 'somewhat', 'convincing', 'tease', 'suitable', 'object', 'sexual', 'desire', 'found', 'out', 'novel', 'Lolita', 'even', 'younger', 'seen', 'here', 'What', 'LOLITA', 'powerful', 'fact', 'young', 'girl', 'not', 'entirely', 'victim', 'girl', 'fully', 'aware', 'power', 'men', 'power', 'great', 'effect', 'squirm', 'are', 'not', 'accustomed', 'seeing', 'young', 'teenager', 'playing', 'role', 'Cleopatra.However', 'was', 'not', 'thrilled', 'entire', 'film', 'think', 'scenes', 'Clare', 'Quilty', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'are', 'simply', 'confusing', 'probably', 'given', 'fact', 'film', 'not', 'novel', 'Quilty', 'motivations', 'are', 'never', 'clearly', 'revealed', 'rather', 'willing', 'chase', 'Lolita', 'Professor', 'Humbert', 'sole', 'purpose', 'ending', 'Humbert', 'dreams', 'ending', 'movie', 'have', 'imagine', 'are', 'granted', 'much', 'fuller', 'account', 'psychology', 'novel', 'Additionally', 'opening', 'sequence', 'Sellers', 'talent', 'quite', 'apparent', 'awkward', 'contrived', 'end.James', 'Mason', 'performance', 'incredible', 'film', 'truly', 'part', 'conveying', 'twisted', 'desire', 'exception', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'reasoning', 'are', 'asked', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'part', 'gain', 'sympathy', 'Instead', 'are', 'asked', 'sort', 'out', 'ethical', 'mess', 'made', 'end', 'LOLITA', 'fascinating', 'film', 'highly', 'recommend', 'may', 'want', 'put', 'smaller', 'children', 'room', 'press', 'play']",N/A

He IS Humbert, and his cha-cha-cha seduction by Charlotte is one of cinema's great sequences, although Nabokov himself preferred his supping champagne in the bath after the car accident.The second half isn't.  So much excellence is packed into the first that decline is inevitable.  Nonetheless, this is a major Kubrick film.  The use of a foreigner and paedophile to test the limits of society's tolerance (e.g. the violence in the hospital, the surveillance in Beardsley) is an artistic improvement on the one-sided 'Paths of Glory', and points towards the anguish of 'A Clockwork Orange'.  Humbert is in the great tradition of Kubrick heroes who reach a point of masculine power which then spectacularly unravels.  His controlling point of view is constantly undermined by the unnoticed games of Quilty, Lolita, Nabokov and Kubrick, an acceptable tanspositon of Nabokov's narrative minefield.

I was expecting a rushed transfer with a PQ that left muchto be desired.During playback, I was pleasantly awarded with a PQ that was consistently satisfying.The b&w; images displayed clean edge detail, luminous whites, believable mid-tones and levels of gray, aswell as deep black levels. Great contrast throughout the whole feature with very minor crush on only the darkestof blacks.Keep in mind that both Lolita and Barry Lyndon  BRs were not part of an extensive fullrestoration project.  Instead they are the result of clean and deft transfers.The PQ's overall detail at 1080P was more than enough to fill a 52"" XBR lcd screen with authority.Projecting the BR image to a 150"" screen ( via Sony VPL-VW50 1080P projector ) was a major treat,with no noticeable loss of detail or contrast ( the inky blacks, crisp whites and endless gray levels with just enough filmgrain remaining. )The SQ was equally satisfying presented in DTS-HD master-audio 5.1.As with the Barry Lyndon BR release, my minor complaints:Only 1 SD trailer included in this single disc, no other supplementary material.Flimsy BR case with no inner card, a spartan treatment of a cinema masterpiece..5 stars for the film4 stars for PQ and SQ1 star for the packaginghalf star for supplementary materialNext year ( 2012 ) will be 50 years since Lolita was released.....could there be a 50th Anniversary BR edition with allthe supplemental goodies awaiting in the wings?

505663,A8UNXASKOYDHY,B00000J2KV,Dennis Anuszewski,"[0, 0]","If you are a big fan of lolita subject movies, then this DVD is a MUST HAVE!!!So far I have found THREE &quot;5 Star&quot; lolita-subject movies at amazon. My #1 favorite &quot;Lolita (1997)&quot;, a very close second #2 &quot;Beau-Pere&quot;, and a distant third place #3, this DVD, &quot;Lolita (1962). I must confess, that if it was not for the rarity of this subject matter on DVD, I would give this DVD about FOUR (4) STARS, due to its lack of EROTIC STEAM. But being thankfull to have a third lolita-subject movie in my collection, I will give it FIVE (5) STARS.NUDITY: Their was absolutely NO NUDITY in this movie. In &quot;Beau-Pere&quot;, there were plenty of topless scenes, a scene of her nude butt walking to the shower, and even some scenes of her laying on top of the guy half naked and doing it!STEAMY SCENES: Their was also no scenes in this movie of a steamy erotic nature. The scenes did not go above the level of a &quot;playfull coy flirt&quot;. In the 1997 remake of &quot;Lolita&quot;, their was plenty of hot steamy scenes. The girl did not have to be half naked to generate erotic steam. The sexy poses, mannerisms, touching, rubbing, kissing, face expressions were VERY HOT!!!STORY and PLOT: What gives this movie its 4 or 5 star rating and it's advantage over the other two movies mentioned is its clever and ingenious plot. This movie had the better story line and character development. The story ended just like a very clever detective story.ROMANCE: However, their was plenty of sweet romance. If their was no romance between the girl and guy---no matter how great the story---this movie would get a THREE STAR rating and would not even count as a lolita-subject movie and would be a total waste.QUESTION: Why do so many reviewers give the story line and even much detail about the movie, taking up much space, when the person reading the review already knows what the movie is about? Or if he does not, he can go to many other places to find out what the movie is about. REVIEWS are intended, and SHOULD stick to discussing the pro's and con's of the movie and a measurement of how good the movie is. Each movie review should be a UNIQUE REPORT, and not a re-telling and re-telling of the story and plot.SUMMARY: If you like movies about an older guy and a teenage girl who share a relationship, then this movie is FOR YOU! BUY IT TODAY! This movie is full of sweet and cute romance scenes. Their is also the rage and jealousy stuff. The chemistry and acting of the characters are OUTSTANDING!ENJOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!",5,A MUST-OWN DVD!,1008979200,"12 22, 2001",2001,2542,"['are', 'big', 'fan', 'lolita', 'subject', 'movies', 'then', 'DVD', 'MUST', 'HAVE', 'far', 'have', 'found', 'THREE', 'quot', '5', 'Star', 'quot', 'lolita-subject', 'movies', 'amazon', '1', 'favorite', 'quot', 'Lolita', '1997', 'quot', 'very', 'close', 'second', '2', 'quot', 'Beau-Pere', 'quot', 'distant', 'third', 'place', '3', 'DVD', 'quot', 'Lolita', '1962', 'must', 'confess', 'was', 'not', 'rarity', 'subject', 'matter', 'DVD', 'would', 'give', 'DVD', 'FOUR', '4', 'STARS', 'due', 'lack', 'EROTIC', 'STEAM', 'being', 'thankfull', 'have', 'third', 'lolita-subject', 'movie', 'collection', 'will', 'give', 'FIVE', '5', 'STARS.NUDITY', 'was', 'absolutely', 'NO', 'NUDITY', 'movie', 'quot', 'Beau-Pere', 'quot', 'were', 'plenty', 'topless', 'scenes', 'scene', 'nude', 'butt', 'walking', 'shower', 'even', 'scenes', 'laying', 'top', 'guy', 'half', 'naked', 'doing', 'STEAMY', 'SCENES', 'Their', 'was', 'also', 'scenes', 'movie', 'steamy', 'erotic', 'nature', 'scenes', 'did', 'not', 'go', 'level', 'quot', 'coy', 'flirt', 'quot', '1997', 'remake', 'quot', 'Lolita', 'quot', 'was', 'plenty', 'hot', 'steamy', 'scenes', 'girl', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'be', 'half', 'naked', 'generate', 'erotic', 'steam', 'sexy', 'poses', 'mannerisms', 'touching', 'rubbing', 'kissing', 'face', 'expressions', 'were', 'VERY', 'HOT', 'STORY', 'PLOT', 'What', 'movie', '4', '5', 'star', 'rating', 'advantage', 'other', 'two', 'movies', 'mentioned', 'clever', 'ingenious', 'plot', 'movie', 'had', 'better', 'story', 'line', 'character', 'development', 'story', 'ended', 'just', 'very', 'clever', 'detective', 'story.ROMANCE', 'However', 'was', 'plenty', 'sweet', 'romance', 'was', 'romance', 'girl', 'guy', '-no', 'matter', 'how', 'great', 'story', '-this', 'movie', 'would', 'get', 'THREE', 'STAR', 'rating', 'would', 'not', 'even', 'count', 'lolita-subject', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'total', 'waste.QUESTION', 'Why', 'do', 'so', 'many', 'reviewers', 'give', 'story', 'line', 'even', 'much', 'detail', 'movie', 'taking', 'up', 'much', 'space', 'when', 'person', 'reading', 'review', 'already', 'what', 'movie', 'not', 'can', 'go', 'many', 'other', 'places', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'movie', 'about', 'REVIEWS', 'are', 'intended', 'SHOULD', 'stick', 'discussing', 'pro', 'con', ""'s"", 'movie', 'measurement', 'how', 'good', 'movie', 'movie', 'review', 'should', 'be', 'UNIQUE', 'REPORT', 'not', 're-telling', 're-telling', 'story', 'plot.SUMMARY', 'like', 'movies', 'older', 'guy', 'teenage', 'girl', 'who', 'share', 'relationship', 'then', 'movie', 'YOU', 'BUY', 'IT', 'TODAY', 'movie', 'full', 'sweet', 'cute', 'romance', 'scenes', 'Their', 'also', 'rage', 'jealousy', 'stuff', 'chemistry', 'acting', 'characters', 'are', 'OUTSTANDING', 'ENJOY']",N/A
505664,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B00000J2KV,Dennis Littrell,"[8, 15]","Among Stanley Kubrick's four great cinematic works-the three others: Dr. Strangelove (1964), 2001, A Space Odyssey (1968), and  A Clockwork Orange (1971)-Lolita (1962) is the most uneven, yet in some ways the most brilliant.  (I understand that Barry Lyndon (1975) is also very good, but I haven't seen it yet.)  The casting, from the improbable choice of Peter Sellers as Claire Quilty, to the exactly right choice of Shelley Winters as Charlotte Haze, to the beautiful Sue Lyon as Lolita, to the ""old world"" James Mason as Humbert Humbert, was inspired.  The witty and intensely focused interpretation of Nabokov's black comedic novel was probably as true to Vladimir's spirit as the silver screen could hope to come, and yet the film was clearly and exactly a Stanley Kubrick work of art.The scene (apparently a Kubrick witticism) in which friends of the dead Charlotte find Humbert in the tub with a scotch and a hand gun, and mistakenly think he is about to blow his brains out from grief when in fact he is in jubilant celebration, is a wonderful variation on Nabokov's text, as is the use of Peter Sellers disguised as a Freudian shrink at the girl's school.  However, I thought the Buster Keatonish slapstick improv with the folding cot at the Enchanted Huntress a bit overdone.Inevitably the recent Adrian Lyne film and Kubrick's must be compared.  The photography in the Lyne film was superior, and Lyne more clearly demonstrated the tragic nature of Humbert's all-controlling obsession.  Otherwise,  Kubrick's Lolita is clearly superior both as entertainment and as cinematic art, mainly because it is free from even a hint of political correctness and passes no judgment.  This is essentially a difference in tone and attitude.  Lyne's film insists that we appreciate the depraved nature of Humbert's desire and how it ruined Lolita.  Kubrick's leads us to believe that Lolita was a tragic figure whose very nature (through no fault of her own, of course) suggests her inevitable corruption, if not by Humbert then by Quilty, or perhaps eventually by our society itself.But neither film was about the actual relationship depicted in the novel, since no one, given the prudish and hypocritical mentality of the American psyche, and the taboo nature of the material, can ever hope to make a film completely true to Nabokov's vision.  Lolita was twelve years old.  That is the singular truth that Kubrick and Lyne were not able to show.  Much is lost in not understanding that Humbert desired a nymphet, shy of her full sexual development, and not a fifteen-year-old.  (Both Sue Lyons and Dominique Swain from Lyne's movie were fifteen years old during the filming.)  Nabokov makes it abundantly clear in the novel that it is precisely the delicate, pre-adolescent form of the girl that excites Humbert.  One recalls the scene in the novel (not presented in either film) in which the perverted Humbert forces Lolita to sit with him in their vehicle near an elementary school as he watches the children cross the street hoping to spot a nymphet to excite him.Until such time as people are able to face the broad spectrum of human sexuality without cant and prejudice, and without fear, an authentic version of Nabokov's novel cannot possibly be filmed.",5,One of Kubrick's best,977529600,"12 23, 2000",2000,3260,"['Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'four', 'great', 'cinematic', 'works-the', 'three', 'others', 'Dr.', 'Strangelove', '1964', '2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', '1968', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', '1971', '-Lolita', '1962', 'most', 'uneven', 'yet', 'ways', 'most', 'brilliant', 'understand', 'Barry', 'Lyndon', '1975', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'casting', 'improbable', 'choice', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'Claire', 'Quilty', 'exactly', 'right', 'choice', 'Shelley', 'Winters', 'Charlotte', 'Haze', 'beautiful', 'Sue', 'Lyon', 'Lolita', 'old', 'world', 'James', 'Mason', 'Humbert', 'Humbert', 'was', 'inspired', 'witty', 'intensely', 'focused', 'interpretation', 'Nabokov', 'black', 'comedic', 'novel', 'was', 'probably', 'true', 'Vladimir', 'spirit', 'silver', 'screen', 'could', 'hope', 'come', 'yet', 'film', 'was', 'clearly', 'exactly', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'work', 'art.The', 'scene', 'apparently', 'Kubrick', 'witticism', 'friends', 'dead', 'Charlotte', 'find', 'Humbert', 'tub', 'scotch', 'hand', 'gun', 'mistakenly', 'think', 'blow', 'brains', 'out', 'grief', 'when', 'fact', 'jubilant', 'celebration', 'wonderful', 'variation', 'Nabokov', 'text', 'use', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'disguised', 'Freudian', 'shrink', 'girl', 'school', 'However', 'thought', 'Buster', 'Keatonish', 'slapstick', 'improv', 'folding', 'cot', 'Enchanted', 'Huntress', 'bit', 'overdone.Inevitably', 'recent', 'Adrian', 'Lyne', 'film', 'Kubrick', 'must', 'be', 'compared', 'photography', 'Lyne', 'film', 'was', 'superior', 'Lyne', 'more', 'clearly', 'demonstrated', 'tragic', 'nature', 'Humbert', 'all-controlling', 'obsession', 'Otherwise', 'Kubrick', 'Lolita', 'clearly', 'superior', 'entertainment', 'cinematic', 'art', 'mainly', 'free', 'even', 'hint', 'political', 'correctness', 'judgment', 'essentially', 'difference', 'tone', 'attitude', 'Lyne', 'film', 'appreciate', 'depraved', 'nature', 'Humbert', 'desire', 'how', 'ruined', 'Lolita', 'Kubrick', 'believe', 'Lolita', 'was', 'tragic', 'figure', 'very', 'nature', 'fault', 'own', 'course', 'inevitable', 'corruption', 'not', 'Humbert', 'then', 'Quilty', 'perhaps', 'eventually', 'society', 'itself.But', 'film', 'was', 'actual', 'relationship', 'depicted', 'novel', 'one', 'given', 'prudish', 'hypocritical', 'mentality', 'American', 'psyche', 'taboo', 'nature', 'material', 'can', 'ever', 'hope', 'make', 'film', 'completely', 'true', 'Nabokov', 'vision', 'Lolita', 'was', 'twelve', 'years', 'old', 'singular', 'truth', 'Kubrick', 'Lyne', 'were', 'not', 'able', 'show', 'Much', 'lost', 'not', 'understanding', 'Humbert', 'desired', 'nymphet', 'shy', 'full', 'sexual', 'development', 'not', 'fifteen-year-old', 'Sue', 'Lyons', 'Dominique', 'Swain', 'Lyne', 'movie', 'were', 'fifteen', 'years', 'old', 'filming', 'Nabokov', 'abundantly', 'clear', 'novel', 'precisely', 'delicate', 'pre-adolescent', 'form', 'girl', 'Humbert', 'One', 'scene', 'novel', 'not', 'presented', 'film', 'perverted', 'Humbert', 'forces', 'Lolita', 'sit', 'vehicle', 'elementary', 'school', 'children', 'cross', 'street', 'hoping', 'spot', 'nymphet', 'excite', 'him.Until', 'such', 'time', 'people', 'are', 'able', 'face', 'broad', 'spectrum', 'human', 'sexuality', 'cant', 'prejudice', 'fear', 'authentic', 'version', 'Nabokov', 'novel', 'can', 'not', 'possibly', 'be', 'filmed']",N/A

505667,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00000J2KV,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 1]","There's always been a pall of prurience over Vladimir Nabokov'sclassic 1955 novel, and although the prurience was dialed down to mere naughtiness in the 1962 film adaptation, there is still that discomforting feeling of watching two pedophiliacs chasing after a very young girl. However, master director Stanley Kubrick wisely left out the book's more controversial aspects and entrusted the audience to use their fervent imaginations to fill in the action. This explains why the title character, a twelve-year-old nymphet in the book, has turned into a fifteen-year old screen siren played by an already anatomically developed, throaty-voiced Sue Lyon. The switch neutralizes some of the dramatic impact, but fortunately, Kubrick was able to elicit a quartet of fine performances to carry the story. Even though Nabokov is credited with the screenplay, Kubrick made a number of revisions to clarify the narrative flow and appease the censors. The result is far too long at 153 minutes, but it's still provocatively entertaining as it alternates between funny and eccentric. It's well worth seeing the caliber of Kubrick's cinematic work between 1960'sSpartacusand 1964'sDr. Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.The film opens with a shooting which we soon realize is the story's inevitable climax. After that, we flash back four years to the arrival of Professor Humbert Humbert in a small town in New Hampshire. A middle-aged British lecturer of French poetry, he has accepted a teaching job in Ohio for the fall and wants to relax in what he envisions to be a quiet setting for the summer. Humbert rents a room from Charlotte Haze, a blowsy, fortyish widow with immediate designs on him. However, his eye is drawn to her sexy, flirtatious daughter Lolita. Things go awry when Humbert decides to marry Charlotte to be near Lolita. When his true motivation is discovered, tragedy occurs, and Humbert and Lolita set out on a most acrimonious road trip to Ohio. Complications multiply with the periodic appearances of writer Claire Quilty, who also faces temptation with Lolita. For those unfamiliar with the novel, the story takes a surprising twist toward the end.As Humbert, James Mason has the riskiest role, but he effectively manages to convey a dangerous sense of obsession throughout the film. Although his character is basically despicable, Mason still elicits a modicum of sympathy for his perverse weakness. Sue Lyon, fourteen during filming, not only looks right but also brings the necessary combination of precocious confidence and childish selfishness to the title role. You can see echoes of their taboo relationship between Lester and Angela in Sam Mendes'American Beauty. Donning a variety of disguises as Quilty and sporting a flat American accent, Peter Sellers easily steals all his scenes with comic malevolence. The surprising standout is Shelley Winters' performance as Charlotte. Instead of overdoing the character's desperation as you would normally expect from the actress' outsized persona, she is comparatively subtle in conveying Charlotte's needy nature. The only significant extra with the 2007 DVD is the original theatrical trailer which plays up the book's controversy.",4,Diluted Cautionary Tale Benefits from Smart Casting and Kubrick's Cinematic &Eacute;lan,1208217600,"04 15, 2008",2008,3230,"['always', 'been', 'pall', 'prurience', 'Vladimir', ""Nabokov'sclassic"", '1955', 'novel', 'prurience', 'was', 'dialed', 'down', 'mere', 'naughtiness', '1962', 'film', 'adaptation', 'still', 'discomforting', 'feeling', 'watching', 'two', 'pedophiliacs', 'chasing', 'very', 'young', 'girl', 'However', 'master', 'director', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'wisely', 'left', 'out', 'book', 'more', 'controversial', 'aspects', 'entrusted', 'audience', 'use', 'fervent', 'imaginations', 'fill', 'action', 'why', 'title', 'character', 'twelve-year-old', 'nymphet', 'book', 'turned', 'fifteen-year', 'old', 'screen', 'siren', 'played', 'already', 'anatomically', 'developed', 'throaty-voiced', 'Sue', 'Lyon', 'switch', 'dramatic', 'impact', 'fortunately', 'Kubrick', 'was', 'able', 'elicit', 'quartet', 'fine', 'performances', 'carry', 'story', 'Even', 'Nabokov', 'credited', 'screenplay', 'Kubrick', 'made', 'number', 'revisions', 'clarify', 'narrative', 'flow', 'appease', 'censors', 'result', 'far', 'too', 'long', '153', 'minutes', 'still', 'provocatively', 'entertaining', 'funny', 'eccentric', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'caliber', 'Kubrick', 'cinematic', 'work', ""1960'sSpartacusand"", ""1964'sDr"", 'Strangelove', 'How', 'Learned', 'Stop', 'Worrying', 'Love', 'Bomb.The', 'film', 'shooting', 'soon', 'realize', 'story', 'inevitable', 'climax', 'flash', 'back', 'four', 'years', 'arrival', 'Professor', 'Humbert', 'Humbert', 'small', 'town', 'New', 'Hampshire', 'middle-aged', 'British', 'lecturer', 'French', 'poetry', 'accepted', 'teaching', 'job', 'Ohio', 'fall', 'relax', 'what', 'be', 'quiet', 'setting', 'summer', 'Humbert', 'room', 'Charlotte', 'Haze', 'blowsy', 'fortyish', 'widow', 'immediate', 'designs', 'However', 'eye', 'drawn', 'sexy', 'flirtatious', 'daughter', 'Lolita', 'Things', 'go', 'awry', 'when', 'Humbert', 'marry', 'Charlotte', 'be', 'near', 'Lolita', 'When', 'true', 'motivation', 'discovered', 'tragedy', 'occurs', 'Humbert', 'Lolita', 'set', 'out', 'most', 'acrimonious', 'road', 'trip', 'Ohio', 'Complications', 'multiply', 'periodic', 'appearances', 'writer', 'Claire', 'Quilty', 'who', 'also', 'temptation', 'Lolita', 'unfamiliar', 'novel', 'story', 'surprising', 'twist', 'end.As', 'Humbert', 'James', 'Mason', 'riskiest', 'role', 'effectively', 'convey', 'dangerous', 'sense', 'obsession', 'film', 'character', 'basically', 'despicable', 'Mason', 'still', 'modicum', 'sympathy', 'perverse', 'weakness', 'Sue', 'Lyon', 'fourteen', 'filming', 'not', 'only', 'right', 'also', 'necessary', 'combination', 'precocious', 'confidence', 'childish', 'selfishness', 'title', 'role', 'can', 'see', 'echoes', 'taboo', 'relationship', 'Lester', 'Angela', 'Sam', ""Mendes'American"", 'Beauty', 'Donning', 'variety', 'disguises', 'Quilty', 'sporting', 'flat', 'American', 'accent', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'easily', 'scenes', 'comic', 'malevolence', 'surprising', 'standout', 'Shelley', 'Winters', 'performance', 'Charlotte', 'Instead', 'overdoing', 'character', 'desperation', 'would', 'normally', 'expect', 'actress', 'outsized', 'persona', 'comparatively', 'subtle', 'conveying', 'Charlotte', 'needy', 'nature', 'only', 'significant', 'extra', '2007', 'DVD', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'up', 'book', 'controversy']",N/A
505668,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,B00000J2KV,Erik North,"[6, 6]","The advertising line for LOLITA, when it was first unleashed in the middle of 1962, was ""How did they ever make a film out of LOLITA?""  Obviously, ""they""--meaning maverick director Stanley Kubrick and his partner producer James B. Harris--had to proceed with a lot of caution, giving the salaciousness of the Vladimir Nabokov novel they were adapting to the screen (with the author's help).  For some, of course, the finished film didn't seem to go far enough in depicting the novel's story of a forbidden love between a craggy, middle-aged man named Humbert Humbert and the ever seductive teen Dolores ""Lolita"" Haze, and they've instead taken to Adrian Lyne's 1998 remake.  But this is way the game was played with Hollywood censors in the early 1960s, even as the world at large, and Tinsletown in particular, was beginning to undergo a lot of changes, particulary in terms of sexual morals.Even with those restrictions in place, however, and despite its length (153 minutes), LOLITA still has an undeniable power in its depiction of the relationship between Humbert (James Mason) and Lolita (Sue Lyon).  Because of all the censorship restrictions in place at the time, Kubrick could not delve as deeply into the erotic nature of the relationship as the novel did; but the need to imply really helped the film to a great deal, because any sharp viewer or audience member could get the gist of what's going on between Mason and Lyon, and imagine a lot of racier things in their minds.  This and Sellers' supreme turn as the pedophiliac writer Clare Quilty (involving impersonations and convincing American and German accents) push this unconventional romantic drama into the terrain of black comedy, while still putting the film into the area of a 'PG-13' rating in terms of content, whereas Lyne's remake doesn't let anyone think for themselves and shows it all in graphic detail.A lot of second-unit footage of New England aside, Kubrick had to make LOLITA in England just to get financing to begin with; and from that point on, he never made another film in America again.  Then of course, both he and Harris still had to jump through all those censorship hoops to get the film shown at all.  Nevertheless, Kubrick still got very solid performances by Mason (known to many Americans as the heavy in Hitchcock's NORTH BY NORTHWEST), Sellers, and the late Shelley Winters, in a truly fascinating off-kilter performance as Lolita's mother.  And while many have complained over the decades that Lyon was too old to play Lolita, her combination of seductiveness and teen brattiness is quite right for the character, whose name in the decades to come would be synonymous with any firtatious girl having relationships with men twice or three times as old as she is.  The very first scene of her, sunning herself out on the lawn in a bikini and sunglasses, has to count as something of an iconic shot for its time.What doesn't seem to have been discussed much with respect to  LOLITA is the music score here.  Aside from the main title theme composed by Bob Harris, the brother of the producer, the music, even the admittedly chintzy ""Lolita Ya-Ya"", is by the late Nelson Riddle, remembered for his work with Frank Sinatra in the 1950s and with Linda Ronstadt during the last three years of his life.  It accurately captures the feeling of the film's forbidden love story, sometimes with a slight amount of menace a la Bernard Herrmann (ironically, Herrmann was the first one chosen by Kubrick to do the score, but Herrmann balked at having to use Bob Harris' theme within it, which paved the way for Riddle to step in).  The exquisite black-and-white cinematography of Oswald Morris puts the finishing touches on this film.As with Kubrick's very last film EYES WIDE SHUT, LOLITA is a frequently misunderstood film about the psychology of sexual seduction; and as with many of Kubrick's films, one needs to see LOLITA more than a few times to really understand fully the true impact.  That aside, and apart from whatever flaws there are in it, LOLITA remains a fascinating film from a time when things were changing with shocking speed in the world, particularly with respect to the cinema.",4,The LOLITA Factor,1144022400,"04 3, 2006",2006,4186,"['advertising', 'line', 'LOLITA', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'unleashed', 'middle', '1962', 'was', 'How', 'did', 'ever', 'make', 'film', 'LOLITA', 'Obviously', 'meaning', 'maverick', 'director', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'partner', 'producer', 'James', 'B.', 'Harris', 'had', 'proceed', 'lot', 'caution', 'giving', 'salaciousness', 'Vladimir', 'Nabokov', 'were', 'adapting', 'screen', 'author', 'help', 'course', 'finished', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'go', 'far', 'enough', 'depicting', 'novel', 'story', 'forbidden', 'love', 'craggy', 'middle-aged', 'man', 'named', 'Humbert', 'Humbert', 'ever', 'seductive', 'teen', 'Lolita', 'Haze', ""'ve"", 'instead', 'taken', 'Adrian', 'Lyne', '1998', 'remake', 'way', 'game', 'was', 'played', 'Hollywood', 'censors', 'early', '1960s', 'even', 'world', 'large', 'Tinsletown', 'particular', 'was', 'beginning', 'undergo', 'lot', 'changes', 'particulary', 'terms', 'sexual', 'morals.Even', 'restrictions', 'place', 'however', 'length', '153', 'minutes', 'LOLITA', 'still', 'undeniable', 'power', 'depiction', 'relationship', 'Humbert', 'James', 'Mason', 'Lolita', 'Sue', 'Lyon', 'censorship', 'restrictions', 'place', 'time', 'Kubrick', 'could', 'not', 'delve', 'deeply', 'erotic', 'nature', 'relationship', 'novel', 'did', 'need', 'imply', 'really', 'helped', 'film', 'great', 'deal', 'sharp', 'viewer', 'audience', 'member', 'could', 'get', 'gist', 'what', 'going', 'Mason', 'Lyon', 'imagine', 'lot', 'racier', 'things', 'minds', 'Sellers', 'supreme', 'turn', 'pedophiliac', 'writer', 'Clare', 'Quilty', 'involving', 'impersonations', 'convincing', 'American', 'German', 'accents', 'push', 'unconventional', 'romantic', 'drama', 'terrain', 'black', 'comedy', 'still', 'putting', 'film', 'area', ""'PG-13"", ""'"", 'rating', 'terms', 'content', 'Lyne', 'remake', ""n't"", 'let', 'anyone', 'think', 'graphic', 'detail.A', 'lot', 'second-unit', 'footage', 'New', 'England', 'aside', 'Kubrick', 'had', 'make', 'LOLITA', 'England', 'just', 'get', 'financing', 'begin', 'point', 'never', 'made', 'film', 'America', 'again', 'Then', 'course', 'Harris', 'still', 'had', 'jump', 'censorship', 'hoops', 'get', 'film', 'shown', 'Nevertheless', 'Kubrick', 'still', 'got', 'very', 'solid', 'performances', 'Mason', 'known', 'many', 'Americans', 'heavy', 'Hitchcock', 'NORTH', 'BY', 'NORTHWEST', 'Sellers', 'late', 'Shelley', 'Winters', 'truly', 'fascinating', 'off-kilter', 'performance', 'Lolita', 'mother', 'many', 'have', 'complained', 'decades', 'Lyon', 'was', 'too', 'old', 'play', 'Lolita', 'combination', 'seductiveness', 'teen', 'brattiness', 'quite', 'right', 'character', 'name', 'decades', 'come', 'would', 'be', 'synonymous', 'firtatious', 'girl', 'having', 'relationships', 'men', 'twice', 'three', 'times', 'as', 'old', 'very', 'first', 'scene', 'sunning', 'lawn', 'bikini', 'sunglasses', 'count', 'something', 'iconic', 'shot', 'time.What', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'discussed', 'much', 'respect', 'LOLITA', 'music', 'score', 'here', 'Aside', 'main', 'title', 'theme', 'composed', 'Bob', 'Harris', 'brother', 'producer', 'music', 'even', 'admittedly', 'chintzy', 'Lolita', 'Ya-Ya', 'late', 'Nelson', 'Riddle', 'remembered', 'work', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', '1950s', 'Linda', 'Ronstadt', 'last', 'three', 'years', 'life', 'accurately', 'feeling', 'film', 'forbidden', 'love', 'story', 'sometimes', 'slight', 'amount', 'menace', 'la', 'Bernard', 'Herrmann', 'ironically', 'Herrmann', 'was', 'first', 'one', 'chosen', 'Kubrick', 'do', 'score', 'Herrmann', 'balked', 'having', 'use', 'Bob', 'Harris', 'theme', 'paved', 'way', 'Riddle', 'step', 'exquisite', 'black-and-white', 'cinematography', 'Oswald', 'Morris', 'finishing', 'touches', 'film.As', 'Kubrick', 'very', 'last', 'film', 'EYES', 'WIDE', 'SHUT', 'LOLITA', 'frequently', 'misunderstood', 'film', 'psychology', 'sexual', 'seduction', 'many', 'Kubrick', 'films', 'one', 'see', 'LOLITA', 'more', 'few', 'times', 'really', 'understand', 'fully', 'true', 'impact', 'aside', 'apart', 'flaws', 'are', 'LOLITA', 'fascinating', 'film', 'time', 'when', 'things', 'were', 'changing', 'shocking', 'speed', 'world', 'particularly', 'respect', 'cinema']",N/A

Richards,"[2, 3]","When people tell me that this film doesn't follow the novel I like to point out that Nabokov wrote much of the screenplay for this film and he completely approved of the final product, so you can't tell me this film doesn't follow his intentions.This film is very different from the 1997 version. It is really a dark comedy whereas Adrian Lyne's version was a drama. It doesn't have a lot of emotion until near the very end, but it does really touch on the moral and ethical issues that the book raises.Kubrick approaches the subject matter delicately, partially I think because of what was allowed on the screen at that time, but it is exactly what the film needed. The physical relationship between Humbert and Lolita is not really the important part of the story; itsreally about motives and subtext.Humbert in this film is very sneaky, conniving and manipulative. There is scene where he is reading Charlottes love letter and laughing uncontrollably, and yet he ends up marrying her anyway to get closer to Lolita. This is really who Humbert is at his core. And yet by the end of the film we see that what was initially obsession with Lolita has turned to genuine love. He is a character that shocks us a bit, and yet at the same time we sympathize with his predicament.Sue Lyon gave a much more nuanced performance than Dominique Swain (who just came across as a spoiled brat). Her dual role as an immature yet crafty young girl is spot on.Although James Mason and Sue Lyon give great performances, it is the two supporting characters that really deserve the most praise. Shelly Winters as Charlotte plays the lonely but annoying and overbearing mother to perfection. Peter Sellers is hilarious as Quilty; I think he always did best when he was playing multiple characters with disguises and foreign accents.Overall this film was well done and closer I think to the spirit of the book even if it didn't follow the plot exactly. I like it as much as the Adrian Lyne version, but for entirely different reasons.

I had to put down the book, never to return, after the hotel scene in which Humbert screws his 12-year-old stepdaughter.  That may be a vulgar way of putting it, but one of things I disliked about the novel was how the ugly facts of pedophila and child molestation got embellished in long passages of thick purple prose, the suffocating inner workings of Humbert's sick mind, which may ultimately have been the writer's objective but I found the whole premise too repulsive to continue.As noted in another review here, Kubrick takes us out of Humbert's mind and observes Humbert objectively in context with others.  And his Lolita is older than Nabokov's, looking more like 16, and acting like a wily and precocious femme fatale who makes fools of men of all ages.  And since the men act like fools, it's natural that this would become a comedy, albeit a dark one. I can appreciate reviewers who object to the inclusion of Peter Sellers' shtick because it tends to trivialize the tone of the film; the bit with Sellers as the cliched Austrian psychoanalyst was maybe too TV, though the juxtaposition of this Goon Show-like character and Mason's carefully mannered, uptight Humbert was truly funny, especially the expression on Mason's face--almost as though he was thinking, ""Kubrick, what the hell is going on here??"".  I think that Kubrick used Sellers to much better effect later in ""Dr. Strangelove"", which may have been the result of his experimenting with Sellers in ""Lolita"".Anyway, on the whole the performances are good and there are great comedic moments.  There is a tragic feel toward the end of the film as we see Humbert's pathetic attempts to maintain and protect his idealized life with Lolita as it rapidly falls apart, and Mason delivers a standout performance of this.So, see the film on its own terms, don't expect the novel, and enjoy.",4,"Not the Novel, but a Good Film",1245542400,"06 21, 2009",2009,1959,"['Maybe', ""'m"", 'more', 'favorably', 'disposed', 'film', 'have', 'loyalty', 'novel', 'had', 'put', 'down', 'book', 'never', 'return', 'hotel', 'scene', 'Humbert', '12-year-old', 'stepdaughter', 'may', 'be', 'vulgar', 'way', 'putting', 'one', 'things', 'disliked', 'novel', 'was', 'how', 'ugly', 'facts', 'pedophila', 'child', 'molestation', 'got', 'embellished', 'long', 'passages', 'thick', 'purple', 'prose', 'suffocating', 'inner', 'workings', 'Humbert', 'sick', 'mind', 'may', 'ultimately', 'have', 'been', 'writer', 'objective', 'found', 'whole', 'premise', 'too', 'repulsive', 'continue.As', 'noted', 'review', 'here', 'Kubrick', 'Humbert', 'mind', 'Humbert', 'objectively', 'context', 'others', 'Lolita', 'older', 'Nabokov', 'looking', 'more', '16', 'acting', 'wily', 'precocious', 'femme', 'fatale', 'who', 'fools', 'men', 'ages', 'men', 'act', 'fools', 'natural', 'would', 'become', 'comedy', 'dark', 'one', 'can', 'appreciate', 'reviewers', 'who', 'object', 'inclusion', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'shtick', 'trivialize', 'tone', 'film', 'bit', 'Sellers', 'cliched', 'Austrian', 'psychoanalyst', 'was', 'maybe', 'too', 'TV', 'juxtaposition', 'Goon', 'Show-like', 'character', 'Mason', 'carefully', 'mannered', 'uptight', 'Humbert', 'was', 'truly', 'funny', 'especially', 'expression', 'Mason', 'face', 'almost', 'was', 'thinking', 'Kubrick', 'what', 'hell', 'going', 'here', 'think', 'Kubrick', 'used', 'Sellers', 'much', 'better', 'effect', 'later', 'Dr.', 'Strangelove', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'result', 'experimenting', 'Sellers', 'Lolita', '.Anyway', 'whole', 'performances', 'are', 'good', 'are', 'great', 'comedic', 'moments', 'tragic', 'feel', 'end', 'film', 'see', 'Humbert', 'pathetic', 'attempts', 'maintain', 'protect', 'idealized', 'life', 'Lolita', 'rapidly', 'apart', 'Mason', 'standout', 'performance', 'this.So', 'see', 'film', 'own', 'terms', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'novel', 'enjoy']",N/A

I think the book can not be turned into a movie without being either illegal or messing up the contents badly and mortally.

You know what I mean: no situation where it took him 3 years to make it, unlike Eyes Wide Shut.There are currently two movie versions of the Vladimir Nabokov novel: this one and the 1997 version done by Adrien Lyne (Flashdance, Fatal Attraction).Most know the story: a pedophile falls in love with a 14-year old girl (in the book she was 12) who is too grown for her years. Trouble ensues as social norms, a rival, and the girl's own boredom disallows them to live happily ever after.I've read the novel and seen both films. Kubrick's is hands down my favorite adaptation. Lyne's Lolita follows the book more closely, but lacks the spirit and tone of the novel. This Lolita gets it right. It is humorous, yet creepy; but not too creepy. Peter Sellers adds most of the comic relief and makes a good Quilty. Sellers' parts are the most fun to watch in the entire film. Sue Lyons is good as Lolita and Shelly Winters is good as her mother.

Levic,"[2, 3]","LOLITA is one of those films I had heard about for years and finally I had the chance to watch this disturbing film directed by Stanley Kubrick. It's a very disturbing tale about a middle-aged professor, played by the fine James Mason, whose life is obsessed by the teenage Lolita, played remarkably by Sue Lyon. Shelley Winter's is the mother of the troubled Lolita. To top of the cast, add in Peter Sellers as the creepiest of them all. As in DR. STRANGELOVE, Sellers gets to play several characters.I wondered how the story of LOLITA would have been tackled in 1962. There are suggestions and innuendo of an attraction between the professor and Lolita and soon it becomes clear what is actually happening in their relationship. No doubt this created a sensation in its day since Sue Lyon was only 14 or 15 during the filming. It's a very disturbing film about several very troubled individuals. Lolita is much wiser in all matters--more so than a woman 3 times her age. She is no innocent and she willingly plays into the hands of men old enough to be her father.The story is long and drawn out. LOLITA clocks in at over 2 1/2 hours and it seems to drag on. Maybe the unnverving aspect of the storyline makes it harder to digest. The film starts with a killing that seems without reason. The story then goes back in time to give us the set-up.

505677,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B00000J2KV,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[2, 2]","In this film, Stanley Kubrick tackles an important and controversial problem : the love of a middle-aged man for a teenage girl who is rather a titillating character. The man falls in a trap and does not know how to get out of it. He marries the widowed mother to put his hands on the girl. But he becomes the absolute slave of his love and tries to enslave the girl without understanding she has only played with him against her mother and is still playing with him even if the mother is dead now. But Kubrick does not try to explain, to excuse, to understand the psychological reasoning or functioning of the man or the girl. He only gives us a rather cold and distant account of what happens. This shows how the girl is manipulated and also in a way frustrated and traumatised by the experience, and she has another older lover well hidden and leading her to all kinds of lies and fake attitudes. The girl will be led by her failing in capturing an older man as a sole and exclusive lover, she means of course the secret one who tries to get her involved in some kind of kinky filming, into accepting a love affair, mariage and family with a younger man, a man of her age, who is exactly the antagon of her own social position and of the older men she has been involved with : he is poor, he has bad hearing, he has no money and no prospect in society, he has no education, he is exclusively manual and his big dream is to go to Alaska to get some real opportunities there.When the older man, realises that she is beyond any reach from him, he cracks up and gives her everything he has since he is not going to need anything for what he intends. And he intends his own justice, to destroy the man who supposedly soiled Lolita, in fact prevented him from capturing Lolita, because he is still convinced he could have done it. And he does kill him.In this film there is no justification or no condemnation of love from an older man for a teenage girl. There is only the cold description of the consequences which are seen as definitely negative. The film also shows how the girl is playing with fire and manipulating older men to either compete with her mother or experiment with life. She is in a way a sexual bomb that will in the end accept the yoke of mariage provided it is with someone who is the opposite of all those men. She wants, in a way, to start from scratch, though she begs for money from her stepfather.Such a non-committing approach is in a way a provocation in our society where we consider older men must not deal with teenage girls, adults must not get sexually involved with teenagers, love cannot exist between adults and teenagers. We are confronted to a lot of questions and no answers. In other words the film is unethical but thought raking.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Perpignan",5,Can love cross age frontiers?,1041206400,"12 30, 2002",2002,2815,"['film', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'important', 'controversial', 'problem', 'love', 'middle-aged', 'man', 'teenage', 'girl', 'who', 'rather', 'titillating', 'character', 'man', 'trap', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'get', 'widowed', 'mother', 'put', 'hands', 'girl', 'absolute', 'slave', 'love', 'tries', 'enslave', 'girl', 'understanding', 'only', 'played', 'mother', 'still', 'playing', 'even', 'mother', 'dead', 'now', 'Kubrick', 'not', 'try', 'explain', 'excuse', 'understand', 'psychological', 'reasoning', 'functioning', 'man', 'girl', 'only', 'rather', 'cold', 'distant', 'account', 'what', 'how', 'girl', 'manipulated', 'also', 'way', 'frustrated', 'traumatised', 'experience', 'older', 'lover', 'well', 'hidden', 'leading', 'kinds', 'lies', 'fake', 'attitudes', 'girl', 'will', 'be', 'led', 'failing', 'capturing', 'older', 'man', 'sole', 'exclusive', 'lover', 'course', 'secret', 'one', 'who', 'get', 'involved', 'kind', 'kinky', 'filming', 'accepting', 'love', 'affair', 'mariage', 'family', 'younger', 'man', 'man', 'age', 'who', 'exactly', 'antagon', 'own', 'social', 'position', 'older', 'men', 'been', 'involved', 'poor', 'bad', 'hearing', 'money', 'prospect', 'society', 'education', 'exclusively', 'manual', 'big', 'dream', 'go', 'Alaska', 'get', 'real', 'opportunities', 'there.When', 'older', 'man', 'reach', 'up', 'everything', 'not', 'going', 'need', 'anything', 'what', 'own', 'justice', 'destroy', 'man', 'who', 'supposedly', 'soiled', 'Lolita', 'fact', 'prevented', 'capturing', 'Lolita', 'still', 'convinced', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'kill', 'him.In', 'film', 'justification', 'condemnation', 'love', 'older', 'man', 'teenage', 'girl', 'only', 'cold', 'description', 'consequences', 'are', 'seen', 'definitely', 'negative', 'film', 'also', 'how', 'girl', 'playing', 'fire', 'manipulating', 'older', 'men', 'compete', 'mother', 'experiment', 'life', 'way', 'sexual', 'bomb', 'will', 'end', 'accept', 'yoke', 'mariage', 'provided', 'someone', 'who', 'opposite', 'men', 'way', 'start', 'scratch', 'money', 'stepfather.Such', 'non-committing', 'approach', 'way', 'provocation', 'society', 'where', 'consider', 'older', 'men', 'must', 'not', 'deal', 'teenage', 'girls', 'adults', 'must', 'not', 'get', 'sexually', 'involved', 'teenagers', 'love', 'can', 'not', 'exist', 'adults', 'teenagers', 'are', 'confronted', 'lot', 'questions', 'answers', 'other', 'words', 'film', 'unethical', 'thought', 'raking.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Perpignan']",N/A
505678,A3245ZR963JDMI,B00000J2KV,JenX,"[6, 24]","Let me start by saying that I am not a professional movie crictic or writer, this may not be as ""piquantly"" written as some reviews on here, but I am an avid reader of literature, and relatively bright.I've read Nabakov's book Lolita, as well as seen the 1997 version of Lolita and the 1962 version. I think I've gotten the full view and scope of things, so to speak. I must, with heavy heart, tell you honestly, that this movie was a huge let down.  The charaters were very one dimensional and almost cookie cutter. There was a complete lack of any of the emotional turmoil Humbert suffered, as in the book. This movie felt like it was made JUST to be made. Not heartfelt. Lacked insight into any of the characters. Poor chemistry. Certain scenes from the book were either changed completely, or the most annoying, was they were followed thru up to a point, THEN changed. Very frustrating. There was NO sexual relations between Humbert and Lo. Ok, I understand that it was taboo back then and some stuff had to be sensored. But nothing sexual happened. At ALL! Thats what the book was aBOUT. A pre-teen girl having sex with a much older man. It was only even HINTED at very few times.  Why did he bother making this kind of movie if the entire thing had to be sensored? All subtle nuances of love, of first touchings, of Humbert's past were absent. Even an explanation of WHY Humbert was like this in the first place was missing!Lo, in the novel was a plain girl. A girl attractive enough, but definately able to be overlooked. Its important to remember this, for nymphets arent necessarily pretty, but possess a certain aire and charm about them. Sue Lyon was beautiful and much older looking than 12 but possessed nothing nymphet or innocent at all. Much OLDER acting than 12. The whole atmosphere was thrown off by this. High heels?  Um, not for Lo! But they were worn here.""Lolita"". Another thing... Lolita was a pet name given to Lo by Humbert. Only by him, but no, in this version, EVERYONE was calling her ""Lolita"". Even her MOTHER! (I wonder what lurid info mamma had).The mad Quilty was at most a silly nusance here. Not the menacing, forboding quiet giant of the novel. Just laughable. Why she even would be attracted to him in the first place from this version, I'm utterly perplexed.I must say, watch the 1997 version staring Jeremy Irons. It was lush and warm,beautiful and atmospheric, full of subtlties and true character insight. Dominique Swain captured the true essence of a nymphet. Charming, bratty, innocent, but not at all innocent, in sneakers sucking a jawbreaker.I almost cried at the end of that movie there was so much emotion. You actually feel BAD for him that he cant be with his step-daughter. Sick, yes, but it follows the novel expertly. I'm sorry I was so hard on this movie, but Kubrik was hard on the book.

Humbert Humbert the Professor and writer is brilliantly played by James Mason, he will reside at a widow's house, mother of Lolita, Charlotte Haze (Shelley Winters), obviously Charlotte will get attracted to the man and she will do whatever she can to let that feeling become mutual, she's been a widow for 7 years and is still young and yearns for a husband to share her life with. Humbert isn't really interested but he's attracted to her daughter Lolita at first sight and sees the marraige as a chance to come closer to the girl. Dolores ""Lolita"" Haze (Sue Lyon) is a young spoilt and sometimes even rude girl that is innocent and young yet sexy and manipulative (which also was the start for the whole ""Lolita"" concept ofen used in slang later on) Charlotte sends her daugher away for a while when she's newly wed cause she doesn't want her to get between them. One day she will read Humberts diary's where he reveal some very disturbing truths, frustrated and devastated she runs away from home and get hit by a car and dies. Humbert decided to go pick up the girl and take her for a journey. This is where Humberts real obsession with Lolita starts. And eventually he will become an obsessed over-protective father that will not only have a relationship with his own stepdaughter but also forbid her to have an own life where she can be around friends, have fun after school or even see boys. We will find Peter Sellers in a support role as famous movie star/a police man in disguise and a German Dr.Strangelove sounding teacher investigating them ) All this will lead Humbert to paranoia and after fearing both Lolitas emancipation and the fear of someone discovering the truth he will once again escape with her across the country and put her school and his own teacher job aside. There is only one problem, someone is stalking them. A car is following them and Humberts fears of the reality taking over his fantasy world are getting harder to swollow. Alot of things will happen in the latter part of the film but alot of you would probably have put together the pieces already.Stanley Kubrick directed this film and it's a very good adaptation of a difficult classic that is both controvercial and hard to make on the screen. It is diffrent from the original book though and feels like Kubrick's free take instead of a faithful version of a classic book. However, most films are and Kubrick's take is defenitely worthwile. All of the actors in the important roles here are fantastic, especially Mason who's stuck in a very strange role as Mr. Humbert. This film is from 1962, so obviously there isn't much explicit scenes or nudity here. I haven't seen the other version of it from 1997 with Jeremy Irons but I guess it's diffrent. I don't think you get a good understanding of what really happens in their bedrooms cause it doesn't show anything of that here, and Lolita seems untocuhed by the consequnces when many other girls in her situation would suffer an emotioanl breakdown.

505686,A3SLA4ADDSYZJ2,B00000J2KV,Josh Hitchens,"[6, 7]","Perhaps the first ""real"" Stanley Kubrick film, ""Lolita"" shines as a masterpiece. The subject matter is difficult and unpleasant: a middle-aged Humbert Humbert (James Mason) becomes..obsessed with the provocative nymphet Lolita Haze (Sue Lyon). Even Sir Laurence Olivier turned down the role of pedophile Humbert, but eventually James Mason took on the role. It is a difficult one, but James Mason gives the performance of his career in this film.Humbert Humbert comes to America to ""find a haven"" for himself. He is dapper, well-mannered, and polite. He finds lodgings living with the widowed Charlotte Haze, a pathetic.. woman brilliantly played by Shelley Winters. The reason the Humbert decides to stay is because of Charlotte's beautiful fourteen year old daughter Lolita. Humbert becomes obsessed with her, and damns himself when he marries the awful Charlotte to be near her. In a brilliantly played scene, Charlotte discovers Humbert's ..obsession with her daughter and kills herself.Now Humbert is free to indulge in his passion for the nymphet Lolita. Sue Lyon as Lolita Haze gives a performance that was worthy of an Academy Award. New to acting, Lyon's Lolita is so raw, so real, so utterly convincing that we are compelled to see more. Humbert and Lolita go on a road odyssey together, occaisionally settling down, but moving when people become too suspicious of their relationship. In one scene, Lolita cries out against Humbert, cries out of the unfairness of her life and what he has done to her. Soon afterwards Lolita disappears.Years later Humbert finds her again. She is married to a man her own age and is pregnant with his child. Lolita has the brains to realize that she had to get out of a situation that would destroy her. Humbert stands before her exposed, and we realize that he knows how sick his obsessions are. He breaks down before the ""normal"" Lolita, and leaves.That brings us to the fourth great performance of ""Lolita,"" Peter Sellers as the quirky writer Clare Qwilty. Sellers is amusing and gripping in the role of a man who is Humbert's shadow in more ways than one. Because of the censors, Stanley Kubrick had to make the ..elements of the story merely suggestive. This heightens the feelings of the film. Such as when Lolita says that Humbert doesn't love her anymore because he ""hasn't kissed her yet,"" the camera fades to black. We are left to imagine what happens next. These combine to make ""Lolita"" a fascinating psychological character study in the lives of three desperate human beings and the girl who unknowingly destroys them all.",5,Lolita,992908800,"06 19, 2001",2001,2578,"['Perhaps', 'first', 'real', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'film', 'Lolita', 'shines', 'masterpiece', 'subject', 'matter', 'difficult', 'unpleasant', 'middle-aged', 'Humbert', 'Humbert', 'James', 'Mason', 'becomes..obsessed', 'provocative', 'nymphet', 'Lolita', 'Haze', 'Sue', 'Lyon', 'Even', 'Sir', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'turned', 'down', 'role', 'pedophile', 'Humbert', 'eventually', 'James', 'Mason', 'took', 'role', 'difficult', 'one', 'James', 'Mason', 'performance', 'career', 'film.Humbert', 'Humbert', 'America', 'find', 'haven', 'dapper', 'well-mannered', 'polite', 'lodgings', 'living', 'widowed', 'Charlotte', 'Haze', 'pathetic..', 'woman', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'Shelley', 'Winters', 'reason', 'Humbert', 'stay', 'Charlotte', 'beautiful', 'fourteen', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'Lolita', 'Humbert', 'obsessed', 'when', 'awful', 'Charlotte', 'be', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'scene', 'Charlotte', 'Humbert', '..obsession', 'daughter', 'kills', 'herself.Now', 'Humbert', 'free', 'indulge', 'passion', 'nymphet', 'Lolita', 'Sue', 'Lyon', 'Lolita', 'Haze', 'performance', 'was', 'worthy', 'Academy', 'Award', 'New', 'acting', 'Lyon', 'Lolita', 'so', 'raw', 'so', 'real', 'so', 'utterly', 'convincing', 'are', 'compelled', 'see', 'more', 'Humbert', 'Lolita', 'go', 'road', 'odyssey', 'together', 'occaisionally', 'settling', 'down', 'moving', 'when', 'people', 'become', 'too', 'suspicious', 'relationship', 'one', 'scene', 'Lolita', 'out', 'Humbert', 'unfairness', 'life', 'what', 'done', 'Soon', 'afterwards', 'Lolita', 'later', 'Humbert', 'again', 'married', 'man', 'own', 'age', 'pregnant', 'child', 'Lolita', 'brains', 'realize', 'had', 'get', 'situation', 'would', 'destroy', 'Humbert', 'exposed', 'realize', 'how', 'sick', 'obsessions', 'are', 'down', 'normal', 'Lolita', 'leaves.That', 'fourth', 'great', 'performance', 'Lolita', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'quirky', 'writer', 'Clare', 'Qwilty', 'Sellers', 'amusing', 'gripping', 'role', 'man', 'who', 'Humbert', 'shadow', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'censors', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'had', 'make', '..elements', 'story', 'merely', 'suggestive', 'feelings', 'film', 'Such', 'when', 'Lolita', 'Humbert', ""n't"", 'love', 'anymore', ""n't"", 'kissed', 'yet', 'camera', 'black', 'are', 'left', 'imagine', 'what', 'next', 'combine', 'make', 'Lolita', 'fascinating', 'psychological', 'character', 'study', 'lives', 'three', 'desperate', 'human', 'beings', 'girl', 'who', 'unknowingly']",N/A
505687,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B00000J2KV,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[0, 0]","Lolita is Stanley Kubrick's 1962 adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov's 1955 novel, with a screenplay by Nabokov himself (he receives sole writing credit, although Kubrick discarded much of his work). I have not read the novel, but I think few would argue how brave Kubrick was to take on this material during this time. He later admitted that had he realized how severe the censorship limitations would be, he wouldn't have made the film. I'm, for one, glad he did. Not only is this a brave, boundary pushing film but it shows early signs of Kubrick's trademark style and is a perfect example of how some filmmakers were able to brilliantly work past the censors. In an age where you can show anything on film, it takes a special creativity to show nothing and not let the audience notice. Furthermore, it's one of Kubrick's most emotionally dynamic films. Emotional content was not his strong suit as a director and he's been accused of making emotionless films. This is not the case with Lolita. While it has moments of comedy, it's a profoundly sad film.The film takes place in the 1950s and begins at the end. Humbert Humbert (James Mason), a 50-something British professor of French literature, arrives at the home of Clare Quilty (Peter Sellers) and murders him. The film takes us back four years as Humbert arrives in Ramsdale, New Hampshire, where he'll spend the summer before moving on to Beardsley College in the fall. In looking for a room to rent, he encounters Charlotte Haze (Shelley Winters), a lonely widower. At first, Humbert is put off by her flirtatious nature and only agrees to rent the room after eyeing her 14-year-old daughter, Dolores ""Lolita"" Haze (Sue Lyon). After Charlotte becomes infatuated with Humbert, she sends Lolita away to summer camp and professes her love for him. In an effort to remain close with Lolita, he marries Charlotte. Under tragic circumstances Charlotte dies suddenly, leaving Humbert to care for Lolita. He picks her up from camp and the two begin a sad odyssey across the United States, with the mysterious Clare Quilty always close by.With a running time of 2 hours and 33 minutes, Lolita is the rare kind of movie that races by while fitting in a substantial amount of plot. Much occurs in this film within the running time, but it never feels as long as it is. Because it's an adaptation of a celebrated piece of literature, this film would be remembered today regardless of the finished product. I don't believe it would be regarded as highly had any other director been behind it. Despite such rigid restrictions on the content of the story, Kubrick managed to create a special film that is both effective and affecting. In telling a story about a forbidden relationship between an adult and, essentially, a child, he managed to make a film that says all it needs to about the relationship and makes a stunning emotional impact, while never showing them being intimate in any way. Lolita kisses Humbert on the cheek in one scene and (if memory serves me) that kiss isn't even indicative of anything else. Lolita feels timeless, like a recent film rendered black and white. There are those with an aversion to old movies, but even that audience may be surprised by how modern this film seems. It is further proof of what a progressive, ingenious filmmaker Stanley Kubrick was.For all its brilliance as a film, Lolita can be watched just to see the coy, clever ways Kubrick got past the censors. For this story to be conveyed, cinematic trickery had to be employed often, as well as a (unheard of in today's studio system) reliance on the intelligence of the audience and their ability to read between the lines. After all, Humbert is a pedophile (perhaps a hebephile, more accurately) and the slightest implication of that, even today, will get your film in trouble. In one scene, Humbert is embracing Charlotte and they fall onto her bed. His eyes wander and a picture on her nightstand of Lolita comes into the foreground. In other scenes, the screen fades to black after some envelope-pushing dialogue. This effect is utilized a fair amount, but the lines and looks they were able to get past the censors remain surprising.Lolita, the film, the story, really toys with the morals of the viewer in the way it manipulates you to sympathize with some thoroughly immoral people. Humbert is a rather despicable character who only grows more so as the film progresses, yet he receives sympathy almost immediately. Winters' Mrs. Haze is the most sympathetic character, if not the true innocent of the story, and while your heart aches for her, you simultaneously pity Humbert's plight. Much of this owes to Mason's characterization of Humbert; all upper-class arrogance, betraying deep self-loathing. It was a brave move to accept this role and Mason is really quite good. Amusingly enough, he bears a passing resemblance to Richard Nixon and I wonder if this attribute has ever assisted his performance by way of audience sympathy or repulsion. Ultimately, it may be the way Lolita is portrayed that makes it easier to genuinely empathize with Humbert. Or, it may just be the generalized emotions that allow audiences to connect with hi; the genuine longing, the unrequited love, and the feeling of constantly being deceived by this woman/girl. Lolita is a ""victim,"" but in many ways she's the villain. Lyon, only fourteen when she played Lolita, gives a dynamic performance that is simultaneously nave, cunning, innocent, and promiscuous. It's a mature, intelligent performance as evidenced by the interactions between Lyon and Mason. As smart as Humbert is, Lolita always seems to be one step ahead of him.With Humbert being the ""hero"" of the piece, Quilty almost comes to be the personification of evil. I'd guess due to his admiration for Peter Sellers, Kubrick greatly increased Quilty's role in the film. Sellers is remembered as a comedian, but his performance here is far from funny. There's something frightening about the rambling, accented portrayal. The disguises he uses in the film to torment Humbert show the seeds of Dr. Strangelove, but they come across as ominous rather than humorous. Maybe it's just the character itself, but Sellers makes him so creepy. The grip on atmosphere that Kubrick would carry through every one of his films, beginning with 2001, began to rear its head here. His mastery of creating an unbearably tense, uncomfortable feeling out of nothingness (an effect I can't explain or describe in any cinematic terms) started to become prevalent, most notably when Quilty is onscreen.The stunning, ageless, and beautiful black & white cinematography by Oswald Morris and the music by Nelson Riddle (particularly the cheery ""Lolita Ya Ya' that becomes haunting in context) add to the atmosphere. It's really a beautiful film to see and hear. Especially in regards to Charlotte Haze, Kubrick successfully wanders into emotional territory without sacrificing that tone/style that he's so well-known for. The only flaw I find with the film (and it may be part of the novel) is Lolita and Humbert's final exchange, where she reveals Quilty's appearances to Humbert over the years. This makes those scenes feel like they lose some of their mystique. It also seems unnecessary as a viewer, as we know most of what she tells him. Obviously, it's essential that she tell him about Quilty but I found it unnecessary for her to reveal everything.Even today, Lolita is pretty taboo. Many would call it unthinkable to get an audience to sympathize with a character like Humbert, but Kubrick was the one director crazy enough to attempt it in such a conservative time. He succeeded and, despite being rushed in the end, it's another masterpiece from the great director. While much is hinted at or left to the imagination, the film leaves little to be desired. It's marvelously effective and its profound sadness makes it one of Kubrick's most emotional films. It's a startling accomplishment.GRADE: A",5,A Pristine Blu-Ray of A Kubrick Masterpiece,1102464000,"12 8, 2004",2004,7973,"['Lolita', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', '1962', 'adaptation', 'Vladimir', 'Nabokov',

Location - in the novel, Humbert and Lolita travel 27,000 miles in the course of a couple years, and geography plays a substantial part in the book. Filming in England provides little geography and motel-hopping lifestyle that was so prevalent in the novel.4. The same three things in both versions of the movie bother me, as I feel it robs Humbert of some nuance to his character:A. No mention of his pre-Lolita first wife, Valeria. He was not always just into nymphets.B. No mention of his post-Lolita second wife, Rita, (and taping a goodbye note to her navel so she would find it as he goes off to track down Lo).C. The last page-and-a-half from the book was left out. This is possibly the most moving passage of the novel - when Humbert offers his apology for all his nastiness, and his admonition to Lolita, and the revelation that neither Lolita nor Humbert are alive as we read the book, and his pathetic summation...""I am thinking of aurochs and angels, the secret of durable pigments, prophetic sonnets, the refuge of art. And this is the only immortality you and I may share, my Lolita."" It ties everything together and completes the circle.Strengths:1. Acting - this was good by the 4 prime characters - Lolita (Sue Lyon), Humbert (James Mason), Charlotte (Shelley Winters)  and Quilty (Peter Sellers).2.

By playing down the explicit sexual content, which the censors of 1962 apparently could not tolerate, and playing up the tragicomedy.You have to admit: There is something both tragic and funny about Humbert Humbert, including the man's having the same first and last name. Yes, I get the doppelganger reference, but really, how do you take such a person seriously, even if he is a professor. I confess I've always had the same trouble with Ford Madox Ford.Yes, and there's something truly pathetic and very strange about a man of Humbert's age becoming obsessed with a nymphet, even one as precociously flirtatious and brattily manipulative as Lolita.Kubrick didn't have much coice about changing the film for the screen; in fact, he said later that if he knew how difficult it would be, given the salacious subject matter, he might not have attempted it.I'm glad he did, because I think it is one of his most rewarding films. Granted, I didn't like it much at first -- but then again, most Kubrick films benefit from multiple viewings, including this one, ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" ""Barry Lyndon"" and ""Eyes Wide Shut.""Another great thing about this film: The cast. The four principles are, without exception, stunning in their roles. James Mason as Humbert is perfect -- pretentious, hopelessly in love, calculating. Sue Lyon as Lolita brings just the right amount of innocence and sensuality to the role. Shelly Winters is outstanding as Charlotte Haze, Lolita's mother, and Peter Sellers just dazzles as Clare Quilty, who ultimately serves as Humbert's nemesis.One more point: Despite the film's having to engage in a certain amount of vagueness because of the prudishness of the times, did ANYONE ever miss what was really going on between these two? Mason's performance alone tells the tale for me. He is lecherous, unremorseful in his lechery, thoroughly smitten.""Lolita"" is a great American film.

I am not accusing Kubrick of trashing Nabokov's vision.  In fact, Nabokov wrote the screenplay for the film version.  But I am pointing out that, despite their claims at having overcome impossible hurdles to make the film, ""Lolita"", as written, could never have been filmed in 1962.  Kubrick and Co., however, did the best they possibly could.So what, exactly, do they miss?  Well, the most glaring example is that they cut short when it comes time to show the least bit of physical affection between Lo and Humbert Humbert, never mind the more explicit intimacy.  Whether it came from external pressures or internal pragmatism, the film does its best to imply contact between HH and Lo, rather than show it.  The often cited shot of HH holding Charlotte in his arms while looking longingly at a picture of Lo on the bedside table over Charlotte's shoulder is a good example of this.But the biggest thing missing, and the only editorial decision they made that I feel harms the film, is that HH's psychology, why he desires a 12 (changed for the movie to 14) year old girl, is never explained.  No mention is ever made of his childhood crush Annabel.  And there is only one brief reference to his coining of the term 'nymphet' which resulted from this crush.  The film Humbert's pedophilia seems to have appeared, fully formed, the first moment he saw Lolita sunbathing in the backyard.  Although his actions are largely unforgivable, an effort to explain them may have served the film better.  Still, this is but a minor quibble in a film that, while not painstakingly faithful to its source material, at least gets the spirit and tone just right.A lot of credit is due to Nabokov (with Kubrick's help), for constructing a screenplay that retains the literary prose style of his novel (its strength) while adding and shaping and reconstructing the novel's story (its weakness) into a strong cinematic narrative.  Nabokov delights in tossing in names of people and places that appear to explicitly to judge the characters.  Lo spends a summer at 'Camp Climax'.  A hotel clerk is named 'George Swine'.  The night nurse at the hospital where Lo is taken ill is called 'Nurse Fromkiss'.  These deft touches (deft as a sledgehammer) further prove the notion, one I though all along, that ""Lolita"" doesn't take itself seriously.  It's an absurd story, and should be taken as such.This absurdity is best portrayed in Peter Sellers' performance.  Or rather, performances.  Like he does in ""Dr. Strangelove"", Sellers basically plays three parts for Kubrick here.  In each, Sellers' prodigious ability to disappear into a role is put on full display.  His Claire Quilty is a credible American television writer, bored by his own celebrity and powerful enough to get away with a whole lot of mischief.  Quilty is a man of many disguises, one offshoot being the rambling, paranoid hotel guest, who tries every trick in the book to share more of HH's (and, by association, Lo's) company.  Another offshoot is the delicious Dr. Zempf, ostensibly the psychological counselor at Lo's school, who pays HH one wonderfully madcap visit at his home.  It's only one scene, but ""Dr. Zempf"" nearly steals the film, as Sellers, it appears, does a genius stream-of-conscious improv that befuddles HH and, quite possibly, the audience too.Sue Lyon, as the nymphet around whom the story revolves, is a lot older than Lo was in the book.  Well, two years older.  But when those two years are between 12 and 14, it makes a big difference.  Her Lolita is conscious of her power, and, as the film goes along, is more willing to use and abuse it to her advantage.  She, at times, can also be a rather bland presence.  There's a lot of emptiness behind her eyes, and I can't yet figure out of this is a drawback or a boon to her character.  Still, Lyon has an untapped quality to her that gives her a realistic quality despite her mostly amateurish acting.James Mason, as Humbert, has the suave but weathered looks and the English gentility that the character requires.  He's humourous and charming, if a bit shy, during the film's first half.  But Mason ably degenerates into a... well... a degenerate as the second half begins.  The aspect of Mason that's most suited to bringing HH to the big screen is his voice.  Put to good use as the villain in Hitchcock's ""North by Northwest"", where it's rolling lilt perfectly conveyed that character's evil, here it manages to be both suave and creepy.  HH is nothing if not suave and creepy, and Mason captures that perfectly.This being a Kubrick movie, you'd expect a lot of flashy, but necessary, camera work.  Besides the opening scene, his camera is reserved.  ""Lolita"", for the most part, is staged like a play.  The camera sits still and looks, capturing lengthy scenes of dialogue like a voyeur.  It's a technique that works very well, for ""Lolita"" is nothing if not a forbidden entertainment.While generally considered one of Kubrick's lesser works, it does mark the end of his early, pulpy films, and sets the stage for his later, more literary ""masterpieces"".  The first time Kubrick deigned to adapt a book to film, a method that would later yield the grand ""successes"" of  ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""A Clockwork Orange"", and ""The Shining"", ""Lolita"" is as much a success as the prude times allowed it to be.  Which is to say, ultimately, an unqualified one.",4,"A Nabokubrickian Delight: ""Lolita""",1027900800,"07 29, 2002",2002,5792,"['How', 'did', 'ever', 'make', 'movie', 'Lolita', 'asked', 'original',

505713,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,B00000J2KV,Randy Keehn,"[7, 10]","When I was an exchange student in Chile in 1969, I became familiar with the term ""Lolito"".  It was what they called a young person who acted like they were older than they actually were.  Back then in the US we called them ""teeny-boppers"".  I asked my Chilean friends where the term ""Lolito"" came from.  They were surprized that I didn't know the term since it was from an American movie.  That, and not the book or the movie, was my introduction to ""Lolita"".I read the book by Nabokov some years ago.  It didn't appeal to me and, other than remembering that it was about an older man's sexual obsession with a 12 year old girl, I don't recall any of the plot.  I finally had the opportunity to see the movie last night and I was left with a mixed reaction.  This is a quality-made movie with excellence in directing, acting, writing, editing, and cinematography.  Peter Sellers gives an outstanding multi-role preformance and Shelly Winters and James Mason are very good in their roles.  Sue Lyon is probably better than I'm tempted to give her credit for because she creates a somewhat annoying personality of a youth at that age.  I was certain that I saw Miss Moneypenny from James Bond famein the role of Nurse Mary.  I checked it out and it was her.The movie diverts from the book in that the movie comes across as black comedy.  We are invited to see the humor in the sexual relationship between a sexual predator and a 14 year old girl.  I guess that is what black humor is supposed to do; make us laugh at situations not normally associated with humor.  I found myself drawn uncomfortably into the humor but I was more interested in what happened to the main characters.  This is where I felt that the movie let me down.""Lolita"" is, for me, the tragic-comedy of the obsession of a man and how that obsession methodically destroyed him.  It is a brilliant movie in that respect.  However, there is a young girl whom, the movie leads us to believe, was ""inconvenienced"" by this premature sexual relationship with a man nearly 4 times her age.  There are a number of scenes which skillfully depict the loss of her youth but we tend to understand these sacrifices as a sort of ""grounding"".  Other than disappointment, we see little effect on Lolita.  She eventually picks up her life and goes on as though little if anything happened.I confess that I could be found guilty of over-analyzing an otherwise excellent movie but that is how I reacted to ""Lolita"".

505716,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00000J2KV,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[6, 6]","Lolita (Stanley Kubrick, 1962)[note: I swear I originally reviewed Lolita back in 1989, and did so again early in the last decade. However, I cannot find a trace of either review anywhere. And thus I review it for a third time. Apologies if all this sounds familiar. That's because it probably is.I was never a Kubrick fan in my younger days. Granted, when you're a teenager, your critical skills are somewhat impaired, but I always thought Full Metal Jacket, after its wonderful first forty-five minutes, wandered off into utter pointlessness, Dr. Strangelove was weirdly absent of humor for such a revered movie, and 2001 was... well, then. In any case, all that lasted until the first time I saw Lolita back in the late eighties (on a double bill with FMJ). There's a scene about halfway through the film where Humbert (James Mason) and Quilty (Peter Sellers) meet for the first time in a bar. Looking back on it from a post-1995 standpoint, I'm surprised it didn't generate all the excitement of Pacino and DeNiro meeting for the first time in Heat. As for the actual execution, Kubrick's scene blows Mann's right out of the water; Mason, who otherwise overacts through most of the film, is the picture of a guilty conscience, while Sellers is an incredible combination of slapstick and menace. Lolita quickly became my favorite Kubrick film, and remained such for almost twenty years (it was recently surpassed by Paths of Glory). That said, as an adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov's novel, it must be considered an utter failure; part of the mass of idiosyncrasy that was Stanley Kubrick is that his ability to faithfully adapt pretty much anything was subsumed in his consciousness by his desire to make the source material fit into his views both of what filmmaking should be and what social statement he was attempting to make with the movie. (And as a result, according to IMDB, while Nabokov liked the finished film, he wondered why he'd spent the time adapting his novel, since so little of his screenplay was actually used.) There are movies, however, that demand to be looked at as separate works than those that inspired them. Consider the case of Tobe Hooper's adaptations of Robert Bloch's Psycho (which became The Texas Chain Saw Massacre) and Stephen King's 'Salem's Lot. As adaptations, they just plain suck, but as free-standing films, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre has become one of the most respected horror movies of all time, and 'Salem's Lot is a monstrously entertaining exercise in cheese. Such it is with Lolita, a bad adaptation but an excellent film.For those who don't know the plot (how could you not? but I digress), European professor Humbert Humbert, recently divorced, heads off to America to take a teaching position at a small liberal arts college in Ohio. Beforehand, he spends the summer in a resort town in New Hampshire. While looking for lodgings, he meets the irrepressible Charlotte Haze (Shelley Winters) and her stepdaughter Lolita (Sue Lyon). Humbert instantly falls for the nymphet and takes a room at the Haze's place; soon, he will go as far as marrying the mother in order to stay close to the daughter. The film really begins, however, when Charlotte finds out about Humbert's obsession with Lolita and confronts him, never realizing that the other guy she pursued after her husband's death, Claire Quilty (Sellers), is also obsessed with her darling daughter...While elements of black humor had pervaded Kubrick's films before (The Killing is a masterpiece of subtle black comedy, as many of the best noir films are), Lolita was his first attempt at making an out-and-out comedy, and in that regard, it works very well. That's another of the big differences between novel and movie; Nabokov was much more subtle in his humor than Kubrick, who widened and whitened it a great deal here (viz. the cot scene, which could have come out of a Laurel and Hardy flick, or Sellers' penchant for silly accents). Humbert Humbert comes off far less a slave to his obsessions than he does a guy who's feeling put upon by society's silly rules, but once again, if you don't look at it as an adaptation, that's not necessarily a bad thing (and those who would jump to castigate Kubrick for considering the rules Humbert's chafing at ""silly"" might do well to remember Kubrick addressed the same basic theme in Paths of Glory, with much the same outcome; it brings Kubrick's satire of Humbert's outlook into much sharper focus). Mason does tend to overact his part; no one with eyes and ears could fail to notice Humbert's guilty conscience, though pretty much everyone else in the movie, save one nosy neighbor (and Quilty, in the spirit of like-knows-like), does exactly that. Sellers, too, is guilty of a great deal of overacting here as well, but (a) everyone expected that anyway, and (b) in his case, it was all for comic relief.The real surprise here is Sue Lyon, at the beginning of a very brief film career (in which she often played this sort of temptress, viz. Night of the Iguana or Autopsy, romancing Richard Burton and Fernando Rey respectively). During the first half of the film, Lolita herself is an almost unseen character save that first glimpse Humbert gets of her; it's only in the second half of the film that Lolita becomes a character in her own right, and that was exactly the right choice of Kubrick to make in this situation. Humbert seems almost as shocked as the audience that Lolita isn't a cardboard cutout (or, maybe more to the point, a blow-up doll), and it's that transformation that gives much of the second half of the movie the power it has. I grant you, once she does become a three-dimensional character, Lolita heads straight into typical-teenager territory (at least, typical teenager territory for the early sixties), but still.There will be people who just can't get past the subject matter, despite the fact that Kubrick really soft-pedals it (Lolita's age is raised three years and only the barest hints are dropped about intimate activity); if you are one of those people, then you should avoid this. For everyone else it's a must-see. ****",4,"Awful adaptation, but a work of brilliance as a standalone piece of art.",1263600000,"01 16, 2010",2010,6121,"['Lolita', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', '1962', '[',

The first focuses on Humbert Humbert (James Mason) and his involvement with his landlady, Charlotte Haze (Shelley Winters), as well as on his strong physical attraction to her teenage daughter Lolita (Sue Lyon). The second and (in my opinion) much less effective segment continues the plot but without Charlotte. Winters brings so much energy to her role as a sexually frustrated widow whose cultural pretensions are both hilarious and pathetic but never endearing. When she is no longer on screen, the plot sags. Mason's performance is consistently first-rate but Lyon's body makes promises her acting skills cannot keep. When she and Mason are required to sustain the narrative, the results are often disappointing. As for the character Clare Quilty (Peter Sellers), I really don't know what quite to make of him. Presumably he represents corruption in various forms and is viewed by Humbert is an unworthy, indeed despicable rival for Lolita's attention. For whatever reasons, Sellers seems to be going through the motions. The supporting players are OK. None stands out.Lolita was directed by Stanley Kubrick and is essentially based on Vladimir Nabakov's controversial novel in which the nymphet is 12 (not 15) and therefore her relationship with Humbert is (or was in 1955) all-the-more shocking.

Towsley,"[9, 10]","Kubrick may not have faithfully rendered his source material, but the story of an obsessive male falling for a woman who is far too young to fulfill his expectations is engrossing nonetheless.  I was surprised to see how closely the track of this doomed relationship follows the scenario of that between alcoholic adults. This film is interesting when taken as a cautionary tale about the inevitabilities of any relationship between two immature people, blurred boundaries, selfishness, infidelities, lies and all.LOLITA is well-made in some ways, frustrating in others.  The shock value is largely gone today, since the film contains very little beyond innuendo.  We know precisely what happens and when, of course, but it's all done in a very 50s-repressed filmic style.  James Mason's Humbert Humbert is a neurotic when we first meet him, and whatever elements of his past have set him up to fall for Lolita at first sight are never really explained. We meet Lolita in the only lascivious shot of the movie, sunbathing in her back yard.  Sue Lyons plays a younger teenager (a couple years older than the Lolita of the novel, actually) with a very accurate child-woman-like combination of boredom, pouting, self-absorption, giggling and see-sawing between moods.  Shelley Winters is annoyingly right as the needy, pitiable mother, and Peter Sellers is good in a rare serious role as Lyon's other elder love interest who has no ethical compunction about interfering with Humbert's pursuit of Lolita.Had Mason simply rented the room from the mother in order to dally with the underage girl, the story would not be nearly as disturbing, though perhaps just as controversial.  But it takes a nasty turn when it becomes clear that Humbert is willing to marry the mother, whom he despises, in order to stay close to Lolita in hopes of a seduction.  The fact that Humbert keeps a diary of his feelings only adds to our distaste for him -- this is not a man with whom the male audience can easily identify. His laughter while reading a love declaration from the mother says it all beautifully.  Humbert is too sad, dissipated and cynical to be sympathetic.  If his soul isn't already lost, he loses it by marrying the mother.On the other hand, Humbert is second only to Lolita herself in our sympathies in this crowd.  The mother is so unlikable that we are tempted to laugh and cheer aloud when she dies unexpectedly, and Peter Sellers' Quilty is such a jerk that we can't certainly root for him.  So we are left to ponder the predicament of Humbert, and witness his foreordained demise.Every beat with Lolita seems authentic to me.  She is the troubled schoolgirl allowing herself to be flattered by older men, learning it is easier to tell them what they want to hear regardless of the truth, but never committing in her heart and doing exactly as she pleases in their absence.  She cries like the little girl she still is when Humbert finally tells her that her mother has died.  And she finally seeks a saner refuge with a boy her own age and opts for the decidedly less risky life of a wife and mother herself, still treating Humbert a little bit like a dad or a rich uncle.The truest thing in the movie for me is the sequence in which Humbert visits Lolita, pregnant and married.  The whole scene is a triumph and in a way the lesson of the movie summed up.  Lolita survives and remains largely ignorant of the destruction she has inadvertantly been a party to as a child and the pain she continues to give poor, lost Humbert by never falling in love with him.  She seems, in fact, the most grown up and the best armored of all the characters in this movie, but knowing what we know about the toll older men often take on underage girls, probably isn't as bullet-proof as she appears.Readers and movie-goers often come to this story looking for titilllation and, I would imagine, go away either missing the point entirely or, hopefully, having learned something about the stupidity, the hopelessness, and the inevitable disappointment of pursuing a liason with an immature partner, innocent or not.It is of considerable import that at the end of the story, Quilty is shot dead and Humbert dies an old man's death of heart failure in prison -- both men roundly humiliated -- while Lolita, who was always the master of her own fate, really, has grown up and charted a simple but appropriate life for herself with someone her age.",4,Watch doomed Mason go to ruin over child-woman Lyons,978652800,"01 5, 2001",2001,4428,"['Kubrick', 'may', 'not',

James Mason is sublime as Humbert Humbert - an intellectual old world European emigre who finds himself in 1950s America on a professorship. His patrician aloofness rubs against the provincial Charlotte Hayes - a homely woman struggling with a recalcitrant daughter Lolita. The poor woman has no idea the depths of the obsession within Humbert's mind - all swirling high culture and depraved Eros. She gives him space in her house to write, and falls in love with him. Humbert is after something much darker - her brattish, nymphette daughter Lolita, but marries Mrs Hayes in order to maintain contact with the family.The Nabokov style is encapsulated in the film: 'And when called upon to enjoy my promotion from lodger to lover, did I experience only bitterness and distaste? No. Mr. Humbert confesses to a certain titillation of his vanity, to some faint tenderness, even to a pattern of remorse, daintily running along the steel of his conspiratorial dagger.'The movie, necessarily can't be as dark as the novel given the subject matter. Lolita is more high school prom queen than true pre-teen. Clare Quilty features as a chameleon rival, played with comic mastery by Peter Sellars. It is a different type of comedy than the novel - more laconic and at times slapstic (the cot in the bedroom scene) than truly dark chocolate subversive. But a Kubrick triumph in any case.

I think Sue Lyon was 16 when she filmed it).So is LOLITA a pedophile's dream?  No.The novel delves deeper into the obsessive love of Humbert for Lolita and sounds closer to a genuinely romantic novel than a sordid, smutty porn story, so most seriously-ill pedophiles will be bored and disappointed by the novel's lack of physical details.And Kubrick's movie?  It can only hint at the relationship, fading out at the beginning of anything controversial and then masking the intimacy in bland dialogue after the fact.So the film becomes the Humbert & Quilty show, focusing on the two men's darkly hilarious struggle to obtain the little girl, even as she grows into her own defiant teenage lover.

505730,AV5G37VFE5NVD,B00000J2KV,Tom Benton,"[4, 5]","""How did they ever make a movie of 'Lolita'?""  So teased the posters for Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov's classic and highly controversialnovel.  Anyone who's read the book would wonder the same thing.  Nabokov's masterwork is apparently unfilmable, because so much of the book rests upon his peerless storytelling skills and lush style.  But while Nabokov is a master of literature, Stanley Kubrick is a master of film, and with Nabokov himself scripting Kubrick's adaptation, they crafted what may very well be the best movie of ""Lolita"" that could ever be made.Naturally, as the film was produced in the early 1960s, censorship prevented any of the more scandalous elements of Nabokov's novel from making it to the big screen.  A lot of the power of the book comes from those elements, and it seems any adaptation of the book made before the 1970s stretched the limits of censorship would fail.  It's a testament to the mastery of Stanley Kubrick that his film remains buoyant without any of that raunchiness.  In fact, though the lack thereof makes Kubrick's film such a different work than the book, it's those differences that make the movie so fascinating.The story hasn't changed, though some elements have been changed slightly, and a few sections have been clipped.  Compressing the novel into a 153-minute film is quite impressive, especially since it never once feels like something is missing or like Kubrick's rushing through things.  His timing is impeccable, and his structuring of the tale is nothing short of masterful, particularly beginning with the chronological end of the story.  All this is captured through daring photography by Oswald Morris, who, interestingly, never worked on any other Kubrick film.So much of the effectiveness of the film should be credited to the cast.  James Mason delivers the performance of his career.  His Humbert Humbert is a very normal and very human character, not someone like Peter Lorre's pedophile in ""M.""  From the film's beginning, Kubrick paints Humbert as a sympathetic figure, very successfully.  Maybe that's because his attraction to the titular nymphette is made all the more conceivable by Sue Lyon, whose beauty, spunk, and youthfulness is perfect for the part.  Similarly, we sympathize with her mother and Humbert's brief wife, played by Shelley Winters, whose character is a pathetic one indeed.Kubrick makes the movie work so well because we are on the side of Humbert.  When Peter Sellers' crafty Clare Quilty, who came off as a vaguely heroic figure in Nabokov's novel, steals Lolita from him, we don't cheer - we feel sorry for poor Mr. Humbert.On top of this, there's seamless editing by Anthony Harvey (who also edited ""Dr. Strangelove""), and a score by Nelson Riddle which is nothing short of delightful.  One particular cue, which has a rock-oriented sound accompanied by childish ""la-la""-ing, is wonderful.The most impressive part of the film, however, is the transition from page to screen through Nabokov's screenplay.  Nabokov's script is an exercise in excellent adaptation, brilliantly condensing his novel while retaining the key elements, transferring certain techniques from the book (such as Humbert's narration) to the screen, modifying scenes ever-so-slightly in order to make the film work as a whole.  Most movies based on books simply borrow the source work's storyline and primary characters, then modify them as they see fit to make a good movie.  Perhaps never in history has an adaptation been so true as Nabokov's.To ever bring Nabokov's ""Lolita"" to the screen in its entirety is impossible.  Too much of the tale relies on its telling in literary format by so detailed and vibrant a writer as Nabokov.  Nevertheless, Kubrick's ""Lolita"" is probably as fine an adaptation of the book as one could ever hope for.

I have also never seen the 1998 remake with Jeremy Irons. I don't know if it would match this one.Kubricks direction is always legendary, and the acting here is top notch.

However, it is all very comical here.""oh HUM, everytime you touch me I go limp all over!""""Yes, I know the feeling.""Classic dialouge in this peice. However there are certain things that are sort of brushed over. LIKE, we never actually SAY that lolita is only twelve years old. You as a fan of the book were already expected to know this. Also the relationship between HUM and LOLITA is never potrayed as sexual, just implied. These were some clever techniques to get this movie released back in 1962.PETER SELLERS is brilliant as always as his character QUILTY, another man obsessed with the little girl. Only he is a much cooler dude.I think it would be a good idea to read this book to get a better understanding of the depth of the plot. I plan to eventually.

You come to free the slaves or something?"".-Clare Quilty (James Mason) to Humbert Humbert (Peter Sellars)The opening line is a rather tongue-in-cheek reference to Kubrick's previous film (which was more Kirk Douglas' film than his since he was brought on board after production had already commenced to replace director Anthony Mann)is also a perfect example of the humor of ""Lolita"".I've often thought that the opening exchange in ""Lolita"" refers as much to US as the audience as it does to the characters in the film (with the main characters being slaves to their own salacious desires and the power of a 14 year old girl played by Sue Lyon).Fidelity can be overrated. Lolita"" manages to be a brilliant film because of the lack of fidelity to its source. Kubrick and Nabokov collaborated on the script which Kubrick promptly rewrote tossing half of the material making a Stanley Kubrick film in the process. Condemned at the time by the Catholic church (well, quite honestly, their newsletters would condemn 99% of the films out there as ""morally objectionable"" for one reason or another), ""Lolita"" holds up amazingly well as one of Kubrick's moral black comedies. Kubrick ended up making less a film of the novel and more a Stanley Kubrick film which became the approach for all of his films made from other sources.The new Blu-ray transfer looks exceptionally good; it is a fine upgrade over the original DVD with a crisper image, improved depth, deeper and richer blacks. Kubrick always excelled at black and white photography (he began as a still photographer professionally at the age of 16)and ""Lolita"" continued to demonstrate his exceptional ability in that area.The soundtrack sounds quite good as well with a nice mono transfer.My only complaint is that ""Lolita"" like ALL of Kubrick's films deserves to have supplementary material on the production of the film (some of the potential material we've seen in Jan Harlan's documentary ""Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures""). A featurette on the production of the film along with the controversey, his working relationship with Vladimir Nabokov (the author later published the screenplay he worked with Kubrick on--it would have made a nice supplement here as well although it would have required licensing)and working with the actors would have been nice. A commentary track by a Kubrick scholar or someone who collaborated with him like Harlan or Michael Herr would have also been enlightening as well. Instead, all we get is the original theatrical trailer.I'd give the film itself five stars, the transfer looks quite nice so 4 1/2 and for supplementary material 1 star. I'd still recommend this but keep your ears open as to whether or not the film might receive a 50th anniversary upgrade at some point.Charolette: Do you believe in God?

505736,A2Q457CES5ZUZ,B00000J2KV,William Hare,"[4, 4]","""Lolita"" is an ode to the sexually experimental sixties delivered by directorial baton master Stanley Kubrick.  While the film's listed screenwriter is Vladimir Nabokov, author of the novel being adapted to the screen, when his scenario was ultimately published it became obvious that Kubrick had placed his own stylish imprint on the script of the daring film.The film begins in the manner of 1950 noir classic ""Sunset Boulevard"" in that we learn that one main character has been eliminated by another.  In the earlier film it was William Holden being shot by live in love Gloria Swanson, while in the 1963 Kubrick masterpiece an enraged and helpless James Mason makes good in his threat to kill Peter Sellers.  Before he is shot Sellers chides him, preferring to believe that his adversary will never follow through with his homicidal plan.We then proceed to action four years earlier via flashback, when professor of literature Mason decides to spend a quiet summer in New Hampshire before starting a new job in the fall at an Ohio college.  He encounters love-starved widow Shelley Winters.  She hopes that his decision to rent a room in her home is occasioned by mutual attraction.  The motivator is instead an overpowering attraction toward her 14-year-old daughter, beautiful blonde Lolita played by screen newcomer Sue Lyon.Tragedy occurs when Winters, reading Mason's private diary, learns that he thinks of her as a ""love sick cow"" and is passionately in love with Lyon.  She runs out into the street and is killed by an oncoming car.Mason uses his strategic wits to become more than Lyon's stepfather, making good on his romantic designs.  Trouble soon looms, however, from an invading force.The catalyst of danger is none other than Peter Sellers, who puts his virtuosity to work by masquerading as various characters such as a policeman and psychiatrist, tormenting Mason by convincing him that he knows what he is up to and that he might be perilously close to the jailhouse door.Ultimately Lyon leaves a devastated Mason.  When he realizes that the zany but wily Sellers has let him court danger through sex with a minor while he plots to successfully take her away in a cleverly subtle ploy, Mason's desperation is pushed to full throttle.  The scenes between masterful tortured intellectual Mason and innovatively zany Sellers are some of the best in cinema annals, daring explorations of sexually driven psyches orchestrated by the imaginative Kubrick.",5,An Innovative Sixties' Look,1083110400,"04 28, 2004",2004,2470,"['Lolita', 'ode', 'sexually', 'experimental', 'sixties', 'delivered', 'directorial', 'baton', 'master', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'film', 'listed', 'screenwriter', 'Vladimir', 'Nabokov', 'author', 'novel', 'being', 'adapted', 'screen', 'when', 'scenario', 'was', 'ultimately', 'published', 'became', 'obvious', 'Kubrick', 'had', 'placed', 'own', 'stylish', 'imprint', 'script', 'daring', 'film.The', 'film', 'manner', '1950', 'noir', 'classic', 'Sunset', 'Boulevard', 'learn', 'one', 'main', 'character', 'been', 'eliminated', 'earlier', 'film', 'was', 'William', 'Holden', 'being', 'shot', 'live', 'love', 'Gloria', 'Swanson', '1963', 'Kubrick', 'masterpiece', 'enraged', 'helpless', 'James', 'Mason', 'good', 'threat', 'kill', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'shot', 'Sellers', 'preferring', 'believe', 'adversary', 'will', 'never', 'follow', 'homicidal', 'plan.We', 'then', 'proceed', 'action', 'four', 'years', 'earlier', 'flashback', 'when', 'professor', 'literature', 'Mason', 'spend', 'quiet', 'summer', 'New', 'Hampshire', 'starting', 'new', 'job', 'fall', 'Ohio', 'college', 'love-starved', 'widow', 'Shelley', 'Winters', 'decision', 'rent', 'room', 'home', 'occasioned', 'mutual', 'attraction', 'motivator', 'instead', 'overpowering', 'attraction', '14-year-old', 'daughter', 'beautiful', 'blonde', 'Lolita', 'played', 'screen', 'newcomer', 'Sue', 'Lyon.Tragedy', 'when', 'Winters', 'reading', 'Mason', 'private', 'diary', 'love', 'sick', 'cow', 'passionately', 'love', 'Lyon', 'out', 'street', 'killed', 'oncoming', 'car.Mason', 'strategic', 'wits', 'become', 'more', 'Lyon', 'stepfather', 'making', 'good', 'romantic', 'designs', 'Trouble', 'soon', 'looms', 'however', 'invading', 'force.The', 'catalyst', 'danger', 'none', 'other', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'who', 'virtuosity', 'work', 'masquerading', 'various', 'characters', 'such', 'policeman', 'psychiatrist', 'tormenting', 'Mason', 'convincing', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'perilously', 'close', 'jailhouse', 'door.Ultimately', 'Lyon', 'devastated', 'Mason', 'When', 'zany', 'wily', 'Sellers', 'let', 'court', 'danger', 'sex', 'minor', 'successfully', 'take', 'away', 'cleverly', 'subtle', 'ploy', 'Mason', 'desperation', 'pushed', 'full', 'throttle', 'scenes', 'masterful', 'tortured', 'intellectual', 'Mason', 'innovatively', 'zany', 'Sellers', 'are', 'best', 'cinema', 'annals', 'daring', 'explorations', 'sexually', 'driven', 'psyches', 'orchestrated', 'imaginative', 'Kubrick']",N/A
505737,A1COQ2DOO1O9HD,B00000J2KV,Wing J. Flanagan,"[149, 169]","Devoted as I am to Vladimir Nabokov's novel of Lolita, and as much good as there was in Adrian Lyne's more accurate interpretation of it, I must confess that Stanley Kubrick's 1962 film version functions better than either as social commentary.  Nabokov's novel was radically subjective - not a thing happened unfiltered by its hero's own vision. Transliterated as it was by Adrien Lyne, the result was claustrophobic.  Kubrick's film, by contrast, invited us to stand outside and look in at the strange behavior of mid-20th century America's ""progressive"" middle-class.  That was the right approach.  By not asking us to relate to an obvious pedophile, or any of the other characters, Kubrick allowed us to fully absorb the ethical and emotional consequences of their interactions.The oddly named Humbert Humbert (James Mason in, perhaps, his finest performance), comes to America from some unspecified European country.  Looking for lodging, he crosses paths with Dolores ""Lolita"" Haze (Sue Lyon), and her mother Charlotte (brilliantly played by Shelley Winters).  What follows is a black comedy swirling giddily around a host of sexual taboos - pedophilia chief among them, as Humbert finds himself sexually obsessed with the teen-aged Lolita.  Had this been a TV-movie of the week, Lolita would have been the saintly victim of the villainous Humbert.  Instead, Kubrick and Nabokov's Lolita is a precocious manipulator - awakening to her sexual identity and the strange power she can exert over members of the opposite sex.  The difference, of course, is that she is a child and doesn't know any better; Humbert is an adult and damn well should.So, for that matter, should Clare Quilty, Humbert's rival for the attentions of the young nymphet.  Quilty, though sicker than Humbert, is a farcical character, played brilliantly by Peter Sellers - the Robin Williams of his day.  The edgy, blackly comedic tone is no better exemplified than in the scenes he and Humbert have together.  It becomes obvious as the film progresses that, in some twisted way, Humbert actually loves Lolita, while Quilty sees her more as the object of a fetish.By the end, Humbert is reduced to a broken shell of a man, and it does not really matter if we approve of his behavior or not: he is still sympathetic, as much a victim of his own demons as Lolita herself, or her hapless mother.  Without lifting a finger to ""redeem"" him, Kubrick forces us to come to terms with Humbert's humanity, as well as his perversion.Compare that to sanctimonious pap like American Beauty, a film that nearly demands that we &quot;understand&quot; its main character, even daring suggest that disapproving of his infatuation with a teenaged girl is akin to the homophobic excesses of his sadistic, one-dimensional ex-Marine neighbor (apparently ugly stereotypes are perfectly OK when applied to conservatives).  Add to this a few patently absurd, over-the-top plot developments and Kubrick's Lolita begins looking better and better.Many have suggested that, had Kubrick made Lolita in a more permissive atmosphere, a different (therefore ""better"") film would have resulted.  I doubt it.  At the end of the day, Kubrick's Lolita is more about foolish, pathetic, self-destructive behavior, than pushing the limits of what salacious content we are allowed to see on-screen.  It is about how obsession and hypocrisy can crush a person.  It is about how very funny we are as a species, with our propensity destroy each other and ourselves for the pettiest, most absurd of reasons.",4,Kubrick's &quot;Lolita&quot; is its own thing...,995587200,"07 20, 2001",2001,3537,"['Devoted', 'am', 'Vladimir', 'Nabokov', 'novel', 'Lolita', 'as', 'much', 'good', 'was', 'Adrian', 'Lyne', 'more', 'accurate', 'interpretation', 'must', 'confess', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', '1962', 'film', 'version', 'functions', 'better', 'social', 'commentary', 'Nabokov', 'novel', 'was', 'radically', 'subjective', 'not', 'thing', 'happened', 'unfiltered', 'hero', 'own', 'vision', 'Transliterated', 'was', 'Adrien', 'Lyne', 'result', 'was', 'claustrophobic', 'Kubrick', 'film', 'contrast', 'invited', 'stand', 'outside', 'look', 'strange', 'behavior', 'mid-20th', 'century', 'America', 'progressive', 'middle-class', 'was', 'right', 'approach', 'not', 'asking', 'relate', 'obvious', 'pedophile', 'other', 'characters', 'Kubrick', 'allowed', 'fully', 'absorb', 'ethical', 'emotional', 'consequences', 'interactions.The', 'oddly', 'named', 'Humbert', 'Humbert', 'James', 'Mason', 'perhaps', 'finest', 'performance', 'America', 'unspecified', 'European', 'country', 'Looking', 'lodging', 'paths', 'Dolores', 'Lolita', 'Haze', 'Sue', 'Lyon', 'mother', 'Charlotte', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'Shelley', 'Winters', 'What', 'black', 'comedy', 'swirling', 'giddily', 'host', 'sexual', 'taboos', 'pedophilia', 'chief', 'Humbert', 'sexually', 'obsessed', 'teen-aged', 'Lolita', 'Had', 'been', 'TV-movie', 'week', 'Lolita', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'saintly', 'victim', 'villainous', 'Humbert', 'Instead', 'Kubrick', 'Nabokov', 'Lolita', 'precocious', 'manipulator', 'awakening', 'sexual', 'identity', 'strange', 'power', 'can', 'exert', 'members', 'opposite', 'sex', 'difference', 'course', 'child', ""n't"", 'know', 'better', 'Humbert', 'adult', 'damn', 'well', 'should.So', 'matter', 'should', 'Clare', 'Quilty', 'Humbert', 'rival', 'attentions', 'young', 'nymphet', 'Quilty', 'sicker', 'Humbert', 'farcical', 'character', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'day', 'edgy', 'blackly', 'comedic', 'tone', 'better', 'exemplified', 'scenes', 'Humbert', 'have', 'together', 'obvious', 'film', 'twisted', 'way', 'Humbert', 'actually', 'Lolita', 'Quilty', 'more', 'object', 'fetish.By', 'end', 'Humbert', 'reduced', 'broken', 'shell', 'man', 'not', 'really', 'matter', 'approve', 'behavior', 'not', 'still', 'sympathetic', 'much', 'victim', 'own', 'demons', 'Lolita', 'hapless', 'mother', 'lifting', 'finger', 'redeem', 'Kubrick', 'come', 'terms', 'Humbert', 'humanity', 'as', 'well', 'perversion.Compare', 'sanctimonious', 'pap', 'American', 'Beauty', 'film', 'nearly', 'quot', 'understand', 'quot', 'main', 'character', 'even', 'daring', 'suggest', 'disapproving', 'infatuation', 'teenaged', 'girl', 'akin', 'homophobic', 'excesses', 'sadistic', 'one-dimensional', 'ex-Marine', 'neighbor', 'apparently', 'ugly', 'stereotypes', 'are', 'perfectly', 'OK', 'when', 'applied', 'conservatives', 'Add', 'few', 'patently', 'absurd', 'over-the-top', 'plot', 'developments', 'Kubrick', 'Lolita', 'looking', 'better', 'better.Many', 'have', 'suggested', 'had', 'Kubrick', 'made', 'Lolita', 'more', 'permissive', 'atmosphere', 'different', 'better', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'resulted', 'doubt', 'end', 'day', 'Kubrick', 'Lolita', 'more', 'foolish', 'pathetic', 'self-destructive', 'behavior', 'pushing', 'limits', 'what', 'salacious', 'content', 'are', 'allowed', 'see', 'on-screen', 'how', 'obsession', 'hypocrisy', 'can', 'crush', 'person', 'how', 'very', 'funny', 'are', 'species', 'propensity', 'destroy', 'other', 'pettiest', 'most', 'absurd', 'reasons']",N/A
