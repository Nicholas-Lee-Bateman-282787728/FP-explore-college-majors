1378662,A27FYYS44LH7KD,B00402FGMG,Thucydides 1,"[12, 14]","You can buy ""A Song is Born"" new here at Amazon for $70.00 and free shipping.  I bought this ten-pack, which included a perfect copy of ""A Song is Born"", and paid $4.99, plus three bucks shipping from an Amazon Seller.Most of you know this, but ""A Song is Born"" is a thoroughly enjoyable movie that is essentially a clever, Big Band-era remake of ""Ball of Fire"".  I had ""Ball of Fire"" (which is also very expensive to buy new), but wanted ""A Song is Born"" to round out the ""set"".  Each movie is charming, but perhaps ""Ball of Fire"" is a little better, mostly because of Barbara Stanwyck. Danny Kaye is excellent in ""A Song is Born"" however, and much more aptly cast in the starring role of the lead ""professor"" than Gary Cooper was in ""Ball of Fire"".  Interestingly, Howard Hawks directed BOTH of these movies.If I never watch any of the other nine features in this set, I'm way ahead of the game.  Just a thought for those of you who weren't born wealthy.
