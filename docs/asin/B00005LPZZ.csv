664352,A1EUPEV1R1SR1X,B00005LPZZ,Lady J.D.,"[0, 1]","I watched the movie Never 2 Big AKA Butter. I liked the plot and the fast pace of the movie. There were small discrepancies that I did not like when Carmen Jones (Nia Long's) character did not lock the door when she let in Freddy Roland (Shemar Moore's) character. There were scenes that were a little inaccurate but I understand the point of the movie.Overall, I enjoyed the movie because of Shemar Moore, Nia Long, and Ernie Hudson. The other actors were great as well. Tony Todd, Donny Wahlberg. Tommy &#34;Tiny&#34; Lister, Jr. played their parts well. I can't forget Salli Richardson. I didn't like that she has a short part in the movie but again I enjoyed it.I would recommend this movie if you are interested in action packed movies with a fast plot. I like movies that interest me and intrigue my mind and this movie did just that.",4,Review of the movie Butter/Never 2 Big,1374019200,"07 17, 2013",2013,840,"['watched', 'movie', 'Never', '2', 'Big', 'AKA', 'Butter', 'liked', 'plot', 'fast', 'pace', 'movie', 'were', 'small', 'discrepancies', 'did', 'not', 'when', 'Carmen', 'Jones', 'Nia', 'Long', 'character', 'did', 'not', 'lock', 'door', 'when', 'let', 'Freddy', 'Roland', 'Shemar', 'Moore', 'character', 'were', 'scenes', 'were', 'little', 'inaccurate', 'understand', 'point', 'movie.Overall', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'Shemar', 'Moore', 'Nia', 'Long', 'Ernie', 'Hudson', 'other', 'actors', 'were', 'great', 'as', 'well', 'Tony', 'Todd', 'Donny', 'Wahlberg', 'Tommy', '34', 'Tiny', '34', 'Lister', 'Jr.', 'played', 'parts', 'well', 'ca', ""n't"", 'forget', 'Salli', 'Richardson', 'did', ""n't"", 'short', 'part', 'movie', 'again', 'enjoyed', 'it.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'are', 'interested', 'action', 'packed', 'movies', 'fast', 'plot', 'like', 'movies', 'interest', 'intrigue', 'mind', 'movie', 'did', 'just']",N/A
664353,A38S8RD8XOXLVS,B00005LPZZ,"SHAWN JAMES ""Amateur Film critic""","[10, 14]","Never 2 Big or ""Butter"" as it is also known had a lot going for it. A strong cast great production values and an interesting premise. It had the potential to be a great movie about the dark side of the music business. The entire cast gives strong performances, Especially Ernie Hudson as the evil record mogul. I only wish Salli Richardson and Nia Long had gotten more screen time- both were excellent in their brief roles. Shemar Moore is quite good in his first feature film role about a record exec who gets mixed up in the shady dealings and is forced to go on the run after his sister is murdered and he's next to be targeted by the record mogul's hitmen well played by Tony Todd and Tiny ""Zeus"" Lister. With all these elements in place you'd expect this ""Butter"" to be sweet. Unfortunately this movie quickly turns to a big piece of government cheese. The film looks great; the cast and producers do their best, but they can't over come ""Butter's"" Margarine, Always 2 shallow, poorly written script which devolves into really bad a shoot em' up urban action movie. The story has entire chunks missing from it and these major details that the producers thought were minor would have helped flesh out the story better. Unfortunately, those portions of the film were left on the cutting room floor and the audience is supposed to assume certain things happened off screen while the hero moves on to the next scene. Big Mistake. Also, For a film about the music business, there wasn't very much music in this film. Strange. The story is a character driven one and with portions of it missing the whole film suffers. The character relationships to one another are not well defined-I wasn't really given a chance to get to know any of the characters or their motivations. In order for a character driven story to work, there must be character development so the audience can be shown what is going to happen and why it's going to happen. Without the explanation of the details, I was confused for most of the film. The way the film is edited it seems people do things get shot and die; the hero wins and the credits roll. I would have like to known why things were happening. Like the music business it's based on this movie looks flashy on the surface, but has nothing really interesting going on underneath it. I wanted to like this movie, but it doesn't feel complete. At the end of the movie Shemar Moore's character says ""Butter, Baby"" But the movie feels like Parkay.",3,Actors strong effort can't save film from its bad script.,1054684800,"06 4, 2003",2003,2473,"['Never', '2', 'Big', 'Butter', 'also', 'known', 'had', 'lot', 'going', 'A', 'strong', 'cast', 'great', 'production', 'values', 'interesting', 'premise', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'great', 'movie', 'dark', 'side', 'music', 'business', 'entire', 'cast', 'strong', 'performances', 'Especially', 'Ernie', 'Hudson', 'evil', 'record', 'mogul', 'only', 'wish', 'Salli', 'Richardson', 'Nia', 'Long', 'had', 'gotten', 'more', 'screen', 'time-', 'were', 'excellent', 'brief', 'roles', 'Shemar', 'Moore', 'quite', 'good', 'first', 'feature', 'film', 'role', 'record', 'exec', 'who', 'mixed', 'up', 'shady', 'dealings', 'forced', 'go', 'run', 'sister', 'murdered', 'next', 'be', 'targeted', 'record', 'mogul', 'hitmen', 'well', 'played', 'Tony', 'Todd', 'Tiny', 'Zeus', 'Lister', 'elements', 'place', ""'d"", 'expect', 'Butter', 'be', 'sweet', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'quickly', 'big', 'piece', 'government', 'cheese', 'film', 'great', 'cast', 'producers', 'do', 'best', 'ca', ""n't"", 'over', 'come', 'Butter', 'Margarine', 'Always', '2', 'shallow', 'poorly', 'written', 'script', 'really', 'bad', 'shoot', 'em', 'up', 'urban', 'action', 'movie', 'story', 'entire', 'chunks', 'missing', 'major', 'details', 'producers', 'thought', 'were', 'minor', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'flesh', 'out', 'story', 'better', 'Unfortunately', 'portions', 'film', 'were', 'left', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'audience', 'supposed', 'assume', 'certain', 'things', 'happened', 'off', 'screen', 'hero', 'next', 'scene', 'Big', 'Mistake', 'Also', 'film', 'music', 'business', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'much', 'music', 'film', 'Strange', 'story', 'character', 'driven', 'one', 'portions', 'missing', 'whole', 'film', 'suffers', 'character', 'relationships', 'one', 'are', 'not', 'well', 'defined-I', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'given', 'chance', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'motivations', 'order', 'character', 'driven', 'story', 'work', 'must', 'be', 'character', 'development', 'audience', 'can', 'be', 'shown', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'why', 'going', 'happen', 'explanation', 'details', 'was', 'confused', 'most', 'film', 'way', 'film', 'edited', 'people', 'do', 'things', 'get', 'shot', 'die', 'hero', 'wins', 'credits', 'roll', 'would', 'have', 'known', 'why', 'things', 'were', 'happening', 'music', 'business', 'based', 'movie', 'flashy', 'surface', 'nothing', 'really', 'interesting', 'going', 'wanted', 'like', 'movie', ""n't"", 'feel', 'complete', 'end', 'movie', 'Shemar', 'Moore', 'character', 'Butter', 'Baby', 'movie', 'feels', 'Parkay']",N/A
