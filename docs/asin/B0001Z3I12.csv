I was thinking about purchasing the DVD's, but after seeing the reviews here I've decided not to.  I disagree (at least in theory, since I didn't see that much of the show) that the lack of the original soundtrack wouldn't make that much of a difference - of course the songs were used in the first place exactly because the producers KNEW they would greatly enhance the realism of the show.  Perhaps the licensing fees for the DVD's were deemed too expensive by Tristar, or perhaps the licensing was simply unavailable in some cases.  What bothers me is that the company didn't tell prospective buyers that on the packaging of the DVD.  Obviously they guessed a lot of fans wouldn't buy the set knowing that up front, so they chose to not say anything and see how many people they could sucker.  That really is a ripoff, and I think Tristar SUCKS for doing that.  I am a musician myself, and for the studio to treat the original musical concept and tapestry of the show so cavalierly is unacceptable - even if the added new tracks by the composer are well done, as I'm sure they are, and if the other aspects of the show are still good (it's also a bit disturbing to read that the DVD picture quality is sub-par).  I won't buy the set now, unless I find that the licensing for the original songs has magically become available and that they have been restored.",1,Why didn't they tell the fans?,1088640000,"07 1, 2004",2004,1443,"['only', 'saw', 'few', 'episodes', 'show', 'syndication', 'awhile', 'liked', 'was', 'thinking', 'purchasing', 'DVD', 'seeing', 'reviews', 'here', ""'ve"", 'decided', 'not', 'disagree', 'least', 'theory', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'show', 'lack', 'original', 'soundtrack', 'would', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'difference', 'course', 'songs', 'were', 'used', 'first', 'place', 'exactly', 'producers', 'KNEW', 'would', 'greatly', 'enhance', 'realism', 'show', 'Perhaps', 'licensing', 'fees', 'DVD', 'were', 'deemed', 'too', 'expensive', 'Tristar', 'perhaps', 'licensing', 'was', 'simply', 'unavailable', 'cases', 'What', 'company', 'did', ""n't"", 'tell', 'prospective', 'buyers', 'packaging', 'DVD', 'Obviously', 'guessed', 'lot', 'fans', 'would', ""n't"", 'buy', 'set', 'knowing', 'up', 'front', 'chose', 'not', 'say', 'anything', 'see', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'could', 'sucker', 'really', 'ripoff', 'think', 'Tristar', 'SUCKS', 'doing', 'am', 'musician', 'myself', 'studio', 'treat', 'original', 'musical', 'concept', 'tapestry', 'show', 'so', 'cavalierly', 'unacceptable', 'even', 'added', 'new', 'tracks', 'composer', 'are', 'well', 'done', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'other', 'aspects', 'show', 'are', 'still', 'good', 'also', 'bit', 'disturbing', 'read', 'DVD', 'picture', 'quality', 'sub-par', 'wo', ""n't"", 'buy', 'set', 'now', 'find', 'licensing', 'original', 'songs', 'magically', 'become', 'available', 'have', 'been', 'restored']",Tour of Duty - The Complete First Season

I've been waiting a long time for a DVD release, and finally it's got one! The main issue here seems to be the fact that the music has been changed, and it has. Yes there's no Paint It Black on the opening credits - but the music is not as 'generic' as people say. It's actually the end theme, and theme that was used throughoput the show that starts it off. The music through the episodes is thematically decent (i.e Hendrix style guitar tracks, and bluesy riffs etc) that don't sound out of place - they're just not instantly recognisable - and it takes NOTHING away from the sheer brilliance of this series. Given the choice - yes I would rather have the original musics, but given the choice between what has been released, and nothing - it's a no contest.

817391,A2VE83MZF98ITY,B0001Z3I12,"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick""","[2, 2]","'Tour of Duty' is one of my favourite televisions series. It didn't last very long, but while it did, it presented a fairly realistic depiction of life in a squad of soldiers in Vietnam. Together with the series 'China Beach', it began to open doors to a difficult subject for the American public to deal with -- the American public, after all, got to see the Vietnam war almost live, day by day, year after year, in their homes on the television sets, the first war for that to happen. The controversial nature of the war and 'peace' aftermath made dealing with the subject tricky, but the writing, acting and direction in this series was superb.The story follows an infantry company 'in-country', Company B, that is made up of a typical mixture of young, green recruits (often draftees) and a few experienced leaders, on their one-year tour of duty in Vietnam; the series began (and this video begins) in 1967, one of the early hot years of the conflict. The base is a typical firecamp, nicknamed Ladybird, with bunkers, sandbags, jungle surroundings, and lots of mud.Stars of the series include many second-tier Hollywood film and television actors, who are all much better actors than their stature might indicate. Key figures included experienced and battle-hardened Sgt. Zeke Anderson (portrayed by Terence Knox, who has been star or guest star on dozens of television series) and relatively-new officer Lt. Myron Goldman (Stephen Caffrey, soap opera star also noted for some quality film work), as they work together to guide a group of men through the literal and metaphorical minefields of the Vietnam war. Other actors include Eric Bruskotter, Joshua Maurer, Kevin Conroy, Stan Foster, and Tony Becker.In the pilot to the series, the men have a mission to destroy a hidden NVA base headquarters.

Every veteran I have ever spoken with had a story they were willing to share and something in the war that made them smile.  Tour of Duty was the first movie or TV show I saw that showed what I was interested in, stories about people who fought the war without graphic violence getting in the way.I used to watch Tour of Duty religiously when it was aired on TV and I still had VHS recordings of the show that were old, dark, and worn out.  I was ecstatic to find Tour of Duty again on DVD.  Tour of Duty follows the men of Bravo Company during the Vietnam War.  Going beyond the violence, it discusses what affected the soldiers and how the men coped with the war.  Topics that the show addressed were topics that people never seemed to speak about.  For example, one episode shows the journey of a war protester forced to actively fight in the war.  Another, shows a solider who accidentally shoots a child.  There is also a great episode that talks about wounded/disabled soldiers who were shipped back to a hospital in Hawaii and the affect the war and their injuries had on the life of a disabled soldier after the war.By today's standards, the acting in Tour of Duty is only average.  However, the show is outstanding considering only a few actors made a name for themselves prior to the series and only a few are still ""visible"" in Hollywood since the series.  Looking through the credits, it is kind of neat to see some of the guest stars that appeared on the show such as David Allen Grier, Tia Carrere, Ving Rhames, Tim Thomerson, and Everett McGill, some of whom were on the show before they were big, some on during their fall from stardom.The DVDs are lacking the original music score, which has been replaced by a somewhat cheesy series of instrumentals.  I think this does take away from the show a little, but the drama and messages in the shows are still there.If you are like me and was a big fan of the show, this is a definite must have.  Otherwise, if you are looking for an excellent portrayal of the people and issues soldiers face in war, the Tour of Duty series would be an excellent addition to your video library.",5,Excellent View Of The People Who Fought The War,1133740800,"12 5, 2005",2005,2283,"['was', 'young', 'had', 'always', 'been', 'intrigued', 'war', 'was', 'never', 'as', 'interested', 'violence', 'was', 'people', 'who', 'fought', 'wars', 'Every', 'veteran', 'have', 'ever', 'spoken', 'had', 'story', 'were', 'willing', 'share', 'something', 'war', 'made', 'smile', 'Tour', 'Duty', 'was', 'first', 'movie', 'TV', 'show', 'saw', 'showed', 'what', 'was', 'interested', 'stories', 'people', 'who', 'fought', 'war', 'graphic', 'violence', 'getting', 'way.I', 'used', 'watch', 'Tour', 'Duty', 'religiously', 'when', 'was', 'aired', 'TV', 'still', 'had', 'VHS', 'recordings', 'show', 'were', 'old', 'dark', 'out', 'was', 'ecstatic', 'find', 'Tour', 'Duty', 'again', 'DVD', 'Tour', 'Duty', 'men', 'Bravo', 'Company', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'Going', 'violence', 'what', 'affected', 'soldiers', 'how', 'men', 'coped', 'war', 'Topics', 'show', 'addressed', 'were', 'topics', 'people', 'never', 'seemed', 'speak', 'example', 'one', 'episode', 'journey', 'war', 'protester', 'forced', 'actively', 'fight', 'war', 'solider', 'who', 'accidentally', 'shoots', 'child', 'also', 'great', 'episode', 'wounded/disabled', 'soldiers', 'who', 'were', 'shipped', 'back', 'hospital', 'Hawaii', 'affect', 'war', 'injuries', 'had', 'life', 'disabled', 'soldier', 'war.By', 'today', 'standards', 'acting', 'Tour', 'Duty', 'only', 'average', 'However', 'show', 'outstanding', 'considering', 'only', 'few', 'actors', 'made', 'name', 'prior', 'series', 'only', 'few', 'are', 'still', 'visible', 'Hollywood', 'series', 'Looking', 'credits', 'kind', 'neat', 'see', 'guest', 'stars', 'appeared', 'show', 'such', 'David', 'Allen', 'Grier', 'Tia', 'Carrere', 'Ving', 'Rhames', 'Tim', 'Thomerson', 'Everett', 'McGill', 'whom', 'were', 'show', 'were', 'big', 'fall', 'stardom.The', 'DVDs', 'are', 'lacking', 'original', 'music', 'score', 'been', 'replaced', 'somewhat', 'cheesy', 'series', 'instrumentals', 'think', 'take', 'away', 'show', 'little', 'drama', 'messages', 'shows', 'are', 'still', 'are', 'was', 'big', 'fan', 'show', 'definite', 'must', 'have', 'Otherwise', 'are', 'looking', 'excellent', 'portrayal', 'people', 'issues', 'soldiers', 'face', 'war', 'Tour', 'Duty', 'series', 'would', 'be', 'excellent', 'addition', 'video', 'library']",Tour of Duty - The Complete First Season

It came out at about the time it was ok to be nostalgic about a war that seemingly went on forever with a number of big-screen flicks on the war also coming out about the same time.  Terence Knox was ideally cast as Sgt. Zeke Anderson, and if  you were one of those people unfortunate enough to have been there, or knew someone who was, you know it was really the wizened-battle hardened sergeant who ran the platoon and not the lieutenant who was in charge.With a cast featuring a number of minorities the show may have been a bit ahead of its time which might explain why it only lasted a few years.  One thing to remember about Viet Nam was that it was the minority groups that made up a large percentage of the troops.Musically, the soundtrack will bring back some memories although some of the tunes on the original series have been replaced due to copyright difficulties.

If you love the show, please buy the set anyway.As a viewer who came to TOUR OF DUTY only in TNT syndication, I never experienced the show with the 60s music that was part of the soundtrack. But even with that music removed and replaced by Conlan's (rather good and unfairly maligned) score, the show is powerful and well-realized in every way. This was one of the greatest dramatic series in all TV history. Its only rival, in terms of war-themed drama, might be COMBAT, a magnificent series that is also coming to DVD this summer.Rights to the music originally used in these episodes were probably only licenced for the original broadcasts, partly, if not largely, because of cost. For future airings, replacement music had to be used. While hearing the great songs of Smokey Robinson, Marvin Gaye and others surely added immeasurably to the mood TOUR OF DUTY, the show does not truly suffer in its current form.The episodes (including the pilot) look quite good in DVD format. Curiously, they have chapter stops, but there is no chapter menu. It's great to have the show uncut and without commercial interruption.It would have been good to have some extras, like interviews with the cast, directors, writers, etc, but the price is fairly reasonable for this much quality in its presentation.Please don't boycott TOUR OF DUTY on DVD, or we will be stuck with Seasons 2 &amp; 3 on commercial-plagued videotapes.",4,TOUR OF DUTY=5 Stars/ DVD set=4 Stars,1087344000,"06 16, 2004",2004,1487,"['must', 'echo', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'TOUR', 'OF', 'DUTY', 'SEASON', 'ONE', 'DVD', 'set', 'love', 'show', 'please', 'buy', 'set', 'anyway.As', 'viewer', 'who', 'came', 'TOUR', 'OF', 'DUTY', 'only', 'TNT', 'syndication', 'never', 'experienced', 'show', '60s', 'music', 'was', 'part', 'soundtrack', 'even', 'music', 'removed', 'replaced', 'Conlan', 'rather', 'good', 'unfairly', 'maligned', 'score', 'show', 'powerful', 'well-realized', 'way', 'was', 'one', 'greatest', 'dramatic', 'series', 'TV', 'history', 'only', 'rival', 'terms', 'war-themed', 'drama', 'might', 'be', 'COMBAT', 'magnificent', 'series', 'also', 'coming', 'DVD', 'summer.Rights', 'music', 'originally', 'used', 'episodes', 'were', 'probably', 'only', 'licenced', 'original', 'broadcasts', 'partly', 'not', 'largely', 'cost', 'future', 'airings', 'replacement', 'music', 'had', 'be', 'used', 'hearing', 'great', 'songs', 'Smokey', 'Robinson', 'Marvin', 'Gaye', 'others', 'surely', 'added', 'immeasurably', 'mood', 'TOUR', 'OF', 'DUTY', 'show', 'not', 'truly', 'suffer', 'current', 'form.The', 'episodes', 'including', 'pilot', 'look', 'quite', 'good', 'DVD', 'format', 'Curiously', 'have', 'chapter', 'stops', 'chapter', 'menu', 'great', 'have', 'show', 'uncut', 'commercial', 'interruption.It', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'have', 'extras', 'interviews', 'cast', 'directors', 'writers', 'etc', 'price', 'fairly', 'reasonable', 'much', 'quality', 'presentation.Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'boycott', 'TOUR', 'OF', 'DUTY', 'DVD', 'will', 'be', 'stuck', 'Seasons', '2', 'amp', '3', 'commercial-plagued', 'videotapes']",Tour of Duty - The Complete First Season
817402,A1WQR544MMF68L,B0001Z3I12,"Mark ""arch-nerd""","[3, 4]","&quot;Tour of Duty&quot; came on TV in 1987, a time in which Hollywood began to address the Vietnam War with a deluge of movies, many of them memorable, others not. &quot;Tour of Duty&quot; was unique in that it lacked the sensationalized stories of films like &quot;Platoon&quot; and &quot;Full Metal Jacket,&quot; but it was also missing the realistic, graphic battle scenes of the later &quot;We Were Soldiers.&quot; &quot;Tour of Duty&quot; focused on a company of young men in Vietnam, beginning in 1967. The episodes revolve around the camraderie and teamwork of the men, their attitudes towards the war, their inner frustrations, and ultimately the bold actions that keep them alive. The attitudes, feelings, and exploits of the Vietnamese forces (NVA, VC, and ARVN) are also examined.Strong acting all-around gives life to the characters. In particular, viewers can see Sgt. Anderson (Terrence Knox) as a father figure to the young infantrymen, and watch Lt. Goldman (Stephen Caffrey) as he develops his leadership abilities over the course of the show.The plots of the episodes range in quality from average to excellent. In the best episodes, viewers feel genuine suspense and develop a sense of despair from watching the soldiers of Bravo Company fight for their lives. Of all the first season episodes, a few really stand out: &quot;Notes from the Underground,&quot; &quot;Brothers, Fathers, and Sons,&quot; &quot;Nowhere to Run,&quot; &quot;Roadrunner,&quot; &quot;Under Siege,&quot; and &quot;Soldiers.&quot; However, none of the episodes are really bad.The weakest aspect of this DVD was the music. The original show played popular songs from the Vietnam era at various points in the episodes. For the DVD, a composer tried to substitute instrumental versions of these songs. Often, they come on at inappropriate times and detract from the mood of the scene. Disappointingly, the show's original theme song (&quot;Paint It, Black&quot; by The Rolling Stones) has been purged from the show. The instrumental closing theme has been substituted instead.As a DVD compilation, this collection is average in terms of conversion to the DVD format.
