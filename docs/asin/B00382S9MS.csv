1330080,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,B00382S9MS,Dr. James Gardner,"[3, 4]","There's nothing much wrong with 2010s ""Deadly Impact"", but there's nothing much right with it either. This type of ""mad bomber vs. tough cop"" was covered in several films, the best including ""Ticker"" (2001) with Dennis Hopper as the mad bomber and Steven Segal as his bomb squad nemesis, and ""Blown Away"" (1994) with Tommy Lee Jones as the mad bomber and Jeff Bridges as his nemesis.So why remake this type of film? Especially if you're going to cast Sean Patrick Flanery as the cop and Joe Pantoliano as the mad bomber. Pantoliano does a pretty good job, but he's not equal to Hopper or Jones, and Flanery is an even weaker link here. The only real treat is Carmen Serano who plays an FBI agent.Don't get me wrong. I think Joe Pantoliano is an excellent character actor. He's given memorable performances in ""The Sopranos"", ""The Matrix"", ""Midnight Run"" and others, but his strength is in the character role, not as the leading villain.Another problem with the film is the lagging direction from Robert Kurtzman. Kurtzman is a distinguished makeup and special effects man who transitioned to producing and directing. This was his 5th film, following ""The Rage"" (2007), ""Buried Alive"" (2007), ""Wishmaster"" (1997), and ""The Demolitionist"" (1995). Unfortunately the film drags, which is a real problem for an action thriller that already has several good films out there with nearly identical plots.BTW - the makeup and special effects, especially Pantoliano's makeup and many disguises are quite good, as one might expect given Kurtzman's background.Another problem comes with the script. There are several flaws, the most noteworthy coming at the very beginning of the film when Pantoliano instructs Flanery to turn out the lights and then fire a rifle, telling him that Pantoliano's cameras are equipped with night sensitive lenses. That may be true, but Flanery is being required to make a very difficult shot, and neither he nor his rifle are equipped with night vision, so once the lights are turned out, he is ""in the dark"", yet he makes this very difficult shot.Bottom line - an OK B film, but there are far better out there with similar plots.",2,B action thriller but you've seen it all before,1318723200,"10 16, 2011",2011,2149,"['nothing', 'much', 'wrong', '2010s', 'Deadly', 'Impact', 'nothing', 'much', 'right', 'type', 'mad', 'bomber', 'vs.', 'tough', 'cop', 'was', 'covered', 'several', 'films', 'best', 'including', 'Ticker', '2001', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'mad', 'bomber', 'Steven', 'Segal', 'bomb', 'squad', 'nemesis', 'Blown', 'Away', '1994', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'mad', 'bomber', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'nemesis.So', 'why', 'remake', 'type', 'film', 'Especially', ""'re"", 'going', 'cast', 'Sean', 'Patrick', 'Flanery', 'cop', 'Joe', 'Pantoliano', 'mad', 'bomber', 'Pantoliano', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'not', 'equal', 'Hopper', 'Jones', 'Flanery', 'even', 'weaker', 'link', 'here', 'only', 'real', 'treat', 'Carmen', 'Serano', 'who', 'FBI', 'agent.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'think', 'Joe', 'Pantoliano', 'excellent', 'character', 'actor', 'given', 'memorable', 'performances', 'Sopranos', 'Matrix', 'Midnight', 'Run', 'others', 'strength', 'character', 'role', 'not', 'leading', 'villain.Another', 'problem', 'film', 'lagging', 'direction', 'Robert', 'Kurtzman', 'Kurtzman', 'distinguished', 'makeup', 'special', 'effects', 'man', 'who', 'transitioned', 'producing', 'directing', 'was', '5th', 'film', 'following', 'Rage', '2007', 'Buried', 'Alive', '2007', 'Wishmaster', '1997', 'Demolitionist', '1995', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'drags', 'real', 'problem', 'action', 'thriller', 'already', 'several', 'good', 'films', 'there', 'nearly', 'identical', 'plots.BTW', 'makeup', 'special', 'effects', 'especially', 'Pantoliano', 'makeup', 'many', 'disguises', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'given', 'Kurtzman', 'background.Another', 'problem', 'script', 'are', 'several', 'flaws', 'most', 'noteworthy', 'coming', 'very', 'beginning', 'film', 'when', 'Pantoliano', 'Flanery', 'turn', 'out', 'lights', 'then', 'fire', 'rifle', 'telling', 'Pantoliano', 'cameras', 'are', 'equipped', 'night', 'sensitive', 'lenses', 'may', 'be', 'true', 'Flanery', 'being', 'required', 'make', 'very', 'difficult', 'shot', 'rifle', 'are', 'equipped', 'night', 'vision', 'so', 'once', 'lights', 'are', 'turned', 'out', 'dark', 'yet', 'very', 'difficult', 'shot.Bottom', 'line', 'OK', 'B', 'film', 'are', 'far', 'better', 'there', 'similar', 'plots']",Deadly Impact
