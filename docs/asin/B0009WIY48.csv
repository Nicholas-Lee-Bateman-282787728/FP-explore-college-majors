That is NOT to say that this workout is boring -- far from it!

Also: Gin provides plenty of explanation and opportunity to ""get"" the steps; repetition of one move in this routine provided and ""A-HA!"" moment -- I was able to master a step that showed up as and ""Add-On"" in another routine.

914862,A2PVKDWV1K5US1,B0009WIY48,M. Tising,"[4, 4]","I started using Gin Miller's step workouts in the 1990's because I needed a low impact workout I could do at home that wouldn't hurt my ultra-sensitive knees.  I'm back again because I need to lose weight after entering a rather long plateau phase.I like Gin's excellent cueing, which is still just as stellar as it was in the nineties. She was 49 when she made this workout, so I'm within a few years of what her age was at the time and I could be fairly confident about being able to finish the entire thing without falling over. While the moves themselves are fairly basic and depend on higher reps and user-chosen intensity to elevate heart rate, this DVD gets the job done. You will lose weight (if that's what you want), gain endurance and muscle tone while helping your heart and blood pressure--all without hurting your joints.  That's what I ask for in a workout. I alternate this workout with belly dance and yoga to keep my body in a semi-surprised state.I noticed one problem with camera movement for a second or two and a single incorrect cue (at about 46:25), but other than that the production value is high and Gin doesn't miss a beat. The music isn't my favorite of all time, but as an accompaniment to the exercise, it works. Besides, her personality and humor make the workout much easier to tolerate than most--even though the stepping isn't fancy. I don't really need fancy, to be honest.  I need to be able to follow the moves without tripping over my feet with all sorts of dance steps.

The workout is designed so that you keep building on the steps you've learned as you go along, so you can always just do part of it the first time and pick up on the rest of it next time through if you prefer.  People who love the ""dancier"" stuff will probably find this way too boring, but if you just want a good step workout without all the ""jazzy"" stuff, then this workout is for you.",5,Perfect if you like to step but want something simple!!!,1204070400,"02 27, 2008",2008,929,"['do', 'step', 'aerobics', 'class', 'do', ""n't"", 'pick', 'up', 'choreography', 'as', 'quickly', 'other', 'girls', 'do', 'was', 'hoping', 'practice', 'bit', 'home', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'workout', 'workouts', 'have', 'so', 'confused', 'when', 'first', 'try', ""'re"", 'not', 'even', 'able', 'get', 'much', 'exercise', 'one', 'relatively', 'easy', 'follow', 'first', 'time', 'get', 'heartrate', 'even', ""'re"", 'not', 'hitting', 'step', 'perfectly', 'also', 'good', 'solid', 'length', 'approx', 'one', 'hour', 'including', 'warm-up', 'cool-down', 'workout', 'designed', 'so', 'keep', 'building', 'steps', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'go', 'along', 'can', 'always', 'just', 'do', 'part', 'first', 'time', 'pick', 'up', 'rest', 'next', 'time', 'prefer', 'People', 'who', 'love', 'dancier', 'stuff', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'way', 'too', 'boring', 'just', 'want', 'good', 'step', 'jazzy', 'stuff', 'then', 'workout']",Simply Step: Classic Moves

It gives a great cardio workout without having to be a fancy dancer...or at least that is what I have been looking for.  I have quite a few step tapes, but some are just too ""dancey"".  My very first step tape was Gin Miller's Reebok tape which is probably 20 years old by now.  It was so unique and a lot of fun so I thought I would give this tape a shot.  Yes, Gin makes a few corny comments but at the end of the long workout I was sweating and knew I had one great cardio workout.  The steps were easy enough to learn but not so boring I wouldn't want to keep doing the workout.  I have a bum knee and am used to modifying exercises and there were very few times that I had to do that with Simply Step.  Would highly recommend for beginner - intermediate steppers or anyone who wants a good fun cardio workout.",4,Just what I was looking for!,1278892800,"07 12, 2010",2010,907,"['love', 'types', 'workouts', 'have', 'developed', 'true', 'love', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'Step', 'great', 'cardio', 'workout', 'having', 'be', 'fancy', 'dancer', 'least', 'what', 'have', 'been', 'looking', 'have', 'quite', 'few', 'step', 'tapes', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'dancey', 'very', 'first', 'step', 'tape', 'was', 'Gin', 'Miller', 'Reebok', 'tape', 'probably', '20', 'years', 'old', 'now', 'was', 'so', 'unique', 'lot', 'fun', 'thought', 'would', 'give', 'tape', 'shot', 'Yes', 'Gin', 'few', 'corny', 'comments', 'end', 'long', 'workout', 'was', 'sweating', 'knew', 'had', 'one', 'great', 'cardio', 'workout', 'steps', 'were', 'easy', 'enough', 'learn', 'not', 'boring', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'keep', 'doing', 'workout', 'have', 'bum', 'knee', 'am', 'used', 'modifying', 'exercises', 'were', 'very', 'few', 'times', 'had', 'do', 'Simply', 'Step', 'Would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'beginner', 'intermediate', 'steppers', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'fun', 'cardio', 'workout']",Simply Step: Classic Moves

I wish I had bought it sooner...it's great!I own too many exercise DVD's to count and many times they are too short (timewise).  I like to exercise continuously for 45 minutes when doing cardio.  Well this does DVD does the trick and more!  The warmup is a mixture of marches, stepping and stretching.  (8 minutes)Then comes the 51 minutes step/floor combo that really gets you sweating. At first I thought it was going to be easy, but I stayed at the upper end of my Heart Rate Zone (I use a monitor) for more than 70% of the workout.  It is deceivingly strenuous, I think because the steps are uncomplicated.  Anyone can do this DVD the first time and adjust the step height (I use an 8 inch step) or use no step at all if you are a beginner. There are jumps and skips, but most are modified, so you can choose to jump or not...wonderful DVD!I will use this one again and again.",5,Wish I could give it more!!,1205020800,"03 9, 2008",2008,948,"['read', 'reviews', 'Amazon', 'while', 'bought', 'DVD', 'wish', 'had', 'bought', 'sooner', 'great', 'own', 'too', 'many', 'exercise', 'DVD', 'count', 'many', 'times', 'are', 'too', 'short', 'timewise', 'like', 'exercise', 'continuously', '45', 'minutes', 'when', 'doing', 'cardio', 'Well', 'DVD', 'trick', 'more', 'warmup', 'mixture', 'marches', 'stepping', 'stretching', '8', 'minutes', 'Then', '51', 'minutes', 'step/floor', 'combo', 'really', 'sweating', 'first', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'easy', 'stayed', 'upper', 'end', 'Heart', 'Rate', 'Zone', 'use', 'monitor', 'more', '70', '%', 'workout', 'deceivingly', 'strenuous', 'think', 'steps', 'are', 'uncomplicated', 'Anyone', 'can', 'do', 'DVD', 'first', 'time', 'adjust', 'step', 'height', 'use', '8', 'inch', 'step', 'use', 'step', 'are', 'beginner', 'are', 'jumps', 'skips', 'most', 'are', 'modified', 'can', 'choose', 'jump', 'not', 'wonderful', 'DVD', 'will', 'use', 'one', 'again', 'again']",Simply Step: Classic Moves
