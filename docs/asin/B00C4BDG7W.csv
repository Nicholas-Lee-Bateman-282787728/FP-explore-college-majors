1641775,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B00C4BDG7W,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[1, 1]","The film has all the feel, graphics, CG effects, and dialouge as a made for TV film. Dennis Archer (Ty Hungerford) is supposed to deliver information to James, an FBI agent (Cuba Gooding Jr.) but dies before it happens, although they haven't found the body. Mild manner accountant Archer had faked his death before in NY when he was married to investigative reporter Rebecca Scott (Emmanuelle Vaugier). Rebecca did an article on an Australian billionaire who is now under criminal investigation. It just so happens her ex-dead husband worked for him before he died a second time.Rebecca goes to Australia to investigate her husband's death and ends up tagging along with Cuba Goodling jr. after his initial protest.The script is improbable to say the least, especially the main relationship. NY driver's licenses do not require fingerprints either. The film was far too predictable to make it enjoyable. The highlight of the picture is the occasional predictable banter that goes on between Goodling and Vaugier. Save your money and wait for Lifetime to show it.Parental Guide: no f-bombs or sex. Some distorted frosted shower scene rear nudity...and I think she was wearing a bikini on top of that. Some violence, but really doesn't rate an ""R"" in my opinion.",3,TRY MY BIRTHDAY,1371254400,"06 15, 2013",2013,1260,"['film', 'feel', 'graphics', 'CG', 'effects', 'dialouge', 'made', 'TV', 'film', 'Dennis', 'Archer', 'Ty', 'Hungerford', 'supposed', 'deliver', 'information', 'James', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'have', ""n't"", 'found', 'body', 'Mild', 'manner', 'accountant', 'Archer', 'had', 'faked', 'death', 'NY', 'when', 'was', 'married', 'investigative', 'reporter', 'Rebecca', 'Scott', 'Emmanuelle', 'Vaugier', 'Rebecca', 'did', 'article', 'Australian', 'billionaire', 'who', 'now', 'criminal', 'investigation', 'just', 'so', 'ex-dead', 'husband', 'worked', 'died', 'second', 'time.Rebecca', 'Australia', 'investigate', 'husband', 'death', 'up', 'tagging', 'Cuba', 'Goodling', 'jr.', 'initial', 'protest.The', 'script', 'improbable', 'say', 'least', 'especially', 'main', 'relationship', 'NY', 'driver', 'licenses', 'do', 'not', 'require', 'fingerprints', 'film', 'was', 'far', 'too', 'predictable', 'make', 'enjoyable', 'highlight', 'picture', 'occasional', 'predictable', 'banter', 'Goodling', 'Vaugier', 'Save', 'money', 'wait', 'Lifetime', 'show', 'it.Parental', 'Guide', 'f-bombs', 'sex', 'distorted', 'frosted', 'shower', 'scene', 'rear', 'nudity', 'think', 'was', 'wearing', 'bikini', 'top', 'violence', 'really', ""n't"", 'rate', 'R', 'opinion']",Absolute Deception
1641776,A1XT8AJB7S9JJG,B00C4BDG7W,Tony Heck,"[6, 9]","""Can you think of any reason your husband would want to fake his own death?"" When an FBI agent (Gooding Jr.) shows up at a woman's door to let her know her husband was killed she is confused. She thought he died years ago. After showing her pictures to prove what is going on they both become suspicious. When she travels to Australia to investigate she becomes a target of a dangerous group. It is up to her and the FBI agent to unravel the mystery without getting killed. I have noticed that some actors are making only straight to DVD movies. Steven Segal, Van Damme, Wesley Snipes and for some reason Cuba Gooding is in that group. I have to say that of that group Gooding makes the best choices, but this movie is an exception. He is OK in this but the plot is overdone and very predictable and the special effects are very awful. Normally I would say Gooding's movies are good and worth watching but I can't say that about this one. Overall, very cheesy and predictable. I give it a C-.",2,Very cheesy and predictable. I really hope that Cuba Gooding isn't stuck only making these kinds of movies.
