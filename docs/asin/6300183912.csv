204232,A1PTM8XWYPO9DJ,6300183912,"Abhimanyu Katyal ""abhi-k""","[6, 7]","Clift and especially de Havilland's performances in this film have been much touted, and they have strong merits. However, the performances to watch this movie for are really those of Ralph Richardson and Miriam Hopkins. Wyler's direction is tightly controlled and de Havilland sometimes appears over-directed.Clift, on the other hand, seems under-directed, free, and is constantly startling. A bit out of place, at times a little off the mark, but very, very surprising...and very, very original. It is worth watching his early films (like Red River, The Heiress, I Confess and Indiscretion of an American Wife) to fully absorb the novelty of what he brought to the screen. His instincts, though not always dramatically of a piece, are nevertheless so unexpected that they may make him a real joy to watch on screen.The Copland score adds much to the film, and the scene in which Clift plays 'Plaisir d'Amour' to de Havilland and then walks over to her while she draws back (cowers?) on her sofa is very, very special. It fully represents the artistry of the cast and crew involved in making this film.The ending is remarkable. The story and characters are justly famous for their representation of the shyness of the character and her relationship with her family. It is to the credit of this film, that inspite of all it has in place to distract from the story and characters, they are what remain in the mind long after you are done watching the film.

204233,A3JXOXKWOIETIY,6300183912,"Adam Bernstein ""sixtiesuniverse""","[18, 18]","The Heiress is the poignant 1949 film which won Olivia de Havilland a well deserved Oscar for Best Actress.  Based on the book ""Washington Square"" the story is set in the 1840s, focusing on Catherine (de Havilland), a timid naive woman who happens to have an inheritance of $10,000 a year from her mother, and $20,000 a year after her father's death.  Ralph Richardson also gives an outstanding performance here as the father who holds her up to the standard of her late mother.  His view of her not measuring up is one thing that keeps her down.Montgomery Clift plays Morris, the man who courts her.  She falls in love with him, while he's more in love with her money, though she doesn't suspect his alterior motive until it's too late.  Throughout we get sharp witted dialogue, sometimes leaving us subtle between-the-lines clues.  For instance when Morris echoes Catherine's thought that when alone with her Aunt Lavinia he is more eloquent (this implies Lavinia told him of her similar thoughts).  And when in Paris she tells her father that her Aunt's letter gives a first hand account of Paris (implying her Aunt has been talking to Morris).Her father finally tells her how worthless he feels she is, but for her inheritance, so she then puts all her faith in Morris.  They set the time for him to come and take her away to elope, fueling her romantic fantasies of the relationship and she tells him of her falling out with (and apparent disinheritance from) her father, then goes to pack.  The scenes that follow are some of the most moving and disturbing ever set to film.  As she waits for Morris with elated anticipation, her Aunt tells her of her belief in Morris' money motive.  Catherine denies this: ""Morris will love me, where others did not.""After the set time for his arrival comes and goes it dawns on her what has happened and she breaks down.  In the morning she is completely transformed, older, bitter, and drained as she slowly drags her suitcases back up the long dark stairway.  For the rest of the film she ""finds her voice"" as her father says, a lower toned, darker, disillusioned, and bitter voice.  And her father and Morris both find that hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.Another Oscar went to Aaron Copland for the excellent film score.  If you know the song ""I Can't Help Falling in Love"", you'll notice it's a rip off of this score.  Overall one of the top 5 films of the 1940s.",5,I Can't Praise this film highly enough!

204234,A2QZUP0E73ICYH,6300183912,agreggofsociety,"[9, 9]","With all the waiting we Olivia De Havilland & classic movie fans have been put through to get this film released, couldn't Universal at least have done better with the extras than a Robert Osborne introduction?  It's a real pity that The Heiress doesn't seem  to be getting the kind of DVD treatment that the movie deserves.  It's a true classic and one of the finest & most eloquent pictures I've ever seen.  Couldn't they have at least found somebody to do a commentary?  Needless to say, I'm going to buy it anyway because the movie is just plain phenomenal, but I can't help but be slightly disappointed....For those who haven't seen the film, it's a MUST SEE movie.  Watch it to see a brilliant and utterly believable tranformation of character, as performed by Olivia de Havilland in the leading role.  I won't spoil it by saying too much for those who haven't seen the picture, but the scenes with her father are deadly and spot-on with regard to painting a picture of a dysfunctional family situation.  It's heartbreaking and yet cathartic for both Olivia's character and for anyone fortunate enough to see the picture.  Miriam Hopkins is brilliant as the well-meaning aunt who tries too hard.  While she has genuine affection for her niece, it seems clear that she is ultimately one of the people responsible for Olivia's classic & quotable line from the movie, ""Yes, I can be very cruel....  I have been taught by masters.""All the performances are brilliant, and the story is beautifully told.  Nothing and no character is painted in black and white (despite being filmed as such, of course, of course!), and the characters keep you guessing until the end, and even after.  Every character has a sympathetic or redeeming quality, which makes the movie that much more believable.  Yet it's a totally satisfying resolution to a very moving film.So I still heartily endorse the purchase of this DVD, but I hope they'll do better with regards to extras and packaging when they get around to releasing TO EACH HIS OWN.",5,"Five Star Film FOR SURE, But Where Are The Extras?!?",1170374400,"02 2, 2007",2007,2023,"['waiting', 'Olivia', 'De', 'Havilland', 'classic', 'movie', 'fans', 'have', 'been', 'put', 'get', 'film', 'released', 'could', ""n't"", 'Universal', 'least', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'extras', 'Robert', 'Osborne', 'introduction', 'real', 'pity', 'Heiress', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'getting', 'kind', 'DVD', 'treatment', 'movie', 'true', 'classic', 'one', 'finest', 'most', 'eloquent', 'pictures', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Could', ""n't"", 'have', 'least', 'found', 'somebody', 'do', 'commentary', 'Needless', 'say', ""'m"", 'going', 'buy', 'anyway', 'movie', 'just', 'plain', 'phenomenal', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'slightly', 'disappointed', '.For', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'MUST', 'SEE', 'movie', 'Watch', 'see', 'brilliant', 'utterly', 'believable', 'tranformation', 'character', 'performed', 'Olivia', 'de', 'Havilland', 'leading', 'role', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'saying', 'too', 'much', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'picture', 'scenes', 'father', 'are', 'deadly', 'spot-on', 'regard', 'painting', 'picture', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'situation', 'heartbreaking', 'yet', 'cathartic', 'Olivia', 'character', 'anyone', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'see', 'picture', 'Miriam', 'Hopkins', 'brilliant', 'well-meaning', 'aunt', 'who', 'too', 'hard', 'genuine', 'affection', 'niece', 'clear', 'ultimately', 'one', 'people', 'responsible', 'Olivia', 'classic', 'quotable', 'line', 'movie', 'Yes', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'cruel', 'have', 'been', 'taught', 'masters', 'performances', 'are', 'brilliant', 'story', 'beautifully', 'told', 'Nothing', 'character', 'painted', 'black', 'white', 'being', 'filmed', 'such', 'course', 'course', 'characters', 'keep', 'guessing', 'end', 'even', 'character', 'sympathetic', 'redeeming', 'quality', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'believable', 'totally', 'satisfying', 'resolution', 'very', 'moving', 'film.So', 'still', 'heartily', 'endorse', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'hope', ""'ll"", 'do', 'better', 'regards', 'extras', 'packaging', 'when', 'get', 'releasing', 'TO', 'EACH', 'HIS', 'OWN']",N/A

I bought the film based on those reviews, and I was a little disappointed after viewing it. I guess I would give it 3 1/2 stars if possible.I agree that there is some fine acting (  less so from Montgomery Clift ) and directing in The Heiress, but I can not particularly distinguish the movie from the dozens of melodramas that were common vehicles for the ""serious"" dramatic actresses of the time: Bette Davis, Olivia de Havilland, Joan Fontaine, Vivien Leigh, etc.Of course, it was a period piece adapted from a Broadway play based on a novella from one of America's classic highbrow authors (he was painful to read in college literature classes); all elements which gave this movie more ""credibility"" than the average Hollywood melodramas of the 30s, 40s, and 50s.

204243,AXSH6O4OP5L4M,6300183912,"Atheen M. Wilson ""Atheen""","[4, 4]","I've been intrigued by this play since I first saw it on television over forty years ago.  I'm not certain it was this particular film I saw, because the one I did see had more of a stage ambiance so it might have been made for TV.  It has always stuck in my mind that the father had been played by Basil Rathbone, and I know he did the stage version of it.  When I saw this available, I decided to get it.My first impression of the film as a girl had been that Catherine Sloper had been reduced to a cipher by a domineering father who hated her because her birth had caused his beloved wife's death, sort of &agrave; la Ebenezer Scrooge and father.  It appeared that the spurned Catherine grew angry and bitter over what she perceived as betrayal by everyone.  I was angry about her hurt and appalled that a father could do such an unloving thing.  Of course Morse loved her despite everything; of course they would have lived happily ever after without the father's meddling!  In this version and as an adult, I'm less certain of that assessment.Certainly there are put downs, as over the red dress, but they don't seem intended to hurt as much as to instruct.  Certainly the doctor misses his wife, has probably created a saint of her in his mind, and has put his daughter in her shadow forever--at least for himself--but this isn't the same as willfully damaging her self esteme, and it doesn't make him a ""bad man.""  In fact, without the story of the plain heiress, his devotion to his deceased wife might make him quite a romantic figure.  Though the play I saw years ago may have accentuated the man's negative aspects and relationship with his daughter, the film does not.  He seems to protect her from negative experiences and attitudes--even his own--of the world and only says what he really thinks when it becomes necessary in his mind to do so. Ralph Richardson's protrayal of him is as a man with real concerns over his daughter's future well being. Whether he's realistic with respect to the girl's charms for others is difficult to say.  We all have our own take on reality. His assessment of his daughter's relative worth on the spouse market seems to have been realistic from what we see during the party episode and no different from that of the girl's aunt. Though the latter is willing to throw caution to the winds to help the young couple because she sees it as Catherine's only chance for happiness, she has very little to lose herself if she's wrong.  Furthermore her marriage was to all appearences a happy one, so she believes this can happen for her neice as well.  But the aunt,though faded, was obviously a beauty at one time.  Her expectations would have been far different from her neice's.  Furthermore, she appears to be living on the generousity of the Doctor, so her own marriage, while happy did not leave her very well off during widowhood.  It is against this potential fate that Dr. Sloper wishes to protect his daughter.  There is a great degree of ambiguity about the motives and beliefs of all the characters, and I think this is intended by the director.  The play is almost a mystery.  The doctor certainly had no difficulty with a man marrying her for her money, he just wanted to make certain the gentleman in question would not simply fritter it away, leaving her not only unloved but destitute.  He knew there would be no one else to look after her interests after his death and so an ""appropriate"" husband was his only recourse and getting rid of an inappropriate one was necessarily on his agenda.I think anyone who knows the culture and expectations of the 19th century--which was when the book on which the play was based was itself written--can hardly fault him for this.  As much as true love was the subject of the novel at the time--indeed still is--there can hardly have been many who would not have understood where this father was coming from. As she taunted him later, he'd never know what she did with the money. This would be true no matter what the circumstances, so in the end for the father, it became a matter of letting go of a child and letting her suffer the consequences of her own decisions.  If he failed her to any great extent it was in not making her a more practical and businesslike person from the start.  Who knows, she might actually have been quite good at it.  That Catherine felt abused and unloved by his attempts to protect her is hardly the point; that she came out of her first real decision experience a very realistic and practical person is.  Growing up is not pleasant sometimes, but we all have to do it.The acting is excellent.  Olivia deHavilland morphs from shy, tongue tied, and awkward child into the poised, disappointed but realistic adult with great skill.  The scenes where she is obviously unable to carry on a conversation beyond yes and no with Morse's sister was so very revealing, as was the awareness of her father and the growing awareness of the sister.  Montgomery Cliff's Morse is charming and his motives seem blameless. It is almost impossible to tell if he's truly in love with the girl or just a gifted actor after the money; it's probable a little of both.  His motives may not have been clear even to himself.  It becomes clearer when he starts looking upon the doctor's house and possessions as his own during the man's absence and when he takes a very proprietorial look at it again after his return from California.  These subtle clues leave us a little anxious for Catherine.  When he takes a too great interest in the possible loss of the additional inheritance, we began to doubt.  Even when he returns later to explain that he was only doing what he felt ""best"" for Catherine, we are tempted to believe him, though she is not.  She has grown up and no longer believes in Santa Claus.  As an audience we want to believe in happily ever after, even if we also know it doesn't often happen like that, but this isn't Jane Austen, this is Henry James.  Catherine refuses him.Though as an audience one is shuffled down the narrow corridor of true love vs bitterness, in reality there is a choice, in fact many.  Catherine enjoyed her role as Aunt to her nieces and nephews. She might also become involved in activities to better the world.  She certainly had the money to do so.  She might even chose to marry someone else and have children of her own.  We don't know, because the author did not continue the story long enough for us to know what happened to her.  Who knows, maybe what came after the door closed on disappointed love the story became even more interesting; it would depend upon how she used the painful lessons she learned.",5,A movie about

204245,A1PASRZ81DY9C,6300183912,Austin Somlo,"[0, 13]","Viewed: 9/11Rate: 79/11: The Heiress is a good film, but not a great one. Although Olivia de Havilland scored an Oscar win for her performance as Catherine Sloper, her performance isn't impressive enough to merit it. It is safe to say her win could be thought of as a makeup to her loss for Best Supporting Actress for Gone with the Wind which was clearly the best performance of her career. In a way, Montgomery Clift seems to have stolen the show during The Heiress, but really, it's Ralph Richardson who is thoroughly excellent as the father of Catherine. His stance against marriage made the most sense yet I wonder why Catherine couldn't simply wait for a year or two to allow Morris Townsend's true feelings to be revealed. For a while, I actually thought I was going to be treated the same Hollywood crap to the end, but luckily, it didn't happen. So, it was a nice ending. On the other hand, the reason for points off from the film, I found the film awkward to watch. It could have been more believable and more natural. But I had a hard time accepting the situation when better ideas could have been proffered. The film asked me to believe in Olivia as this plain-looking girl with plain talents. Are you kidding me? It's Olivia freaking de Havilland. Find somebody else much more, more plain. To make matters worse, a good looking guy trying to get in with a supposedly plain woman is not going to happen unless he is really drunk to think about it. About Morris, you know...it takes a good two minute to figure out his motives, and after some confirmation of his intentions through his speaking and feeling despite the fact it is Montgomery Clift, the ending is no surprise at all. I was just wondering if Hollywood would cheat me out of it. Although Dr. Sloper may have felt differently about her daughter and expressed his feelings to her daughter, I still side with him, and Catherine shouldn't have renounced him the way she did. So, this probably will haunt her in the end regardless of expectations or comparisons that her father have made between her and her mother. People have faults, so what do you expect? For all it's worth, Dr. Sloper was the unrecognized hero of the film although the situation could have been treated differently with some detours. Miriam Hopkins clearly overacted her way out of The Heiress as Aunt Penniman. All in all, The Heiress is still worth watching, but don't expect a masterpiece.",4,Olivia Overdid Her Performance in this Awkward Picture.,1316390400,"09 19, 2011",2011,2433,"['Viewed', '9/11Rate', '79/11', 'Heiress', 'good', 'film', 'not', 'great', 'one', 'Olivia', 'de', 'Havilland', 'scored', 'Oscar', 'win', 'performance', 'Catherine', 'Sloper', 'performance', ""n't"", 'impressive', 'enough', 'merit', 'safe', 'say', 'win', 'could', 'be', 'thought', 'makeup', 'loss', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'was', 'clearly', 'best', 'performance', 'career', 'way', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'have', 'stolen', 'show', 'Heiress', 'really', 'Ralph', 'Richardson', 'who', 'thoroughly', 'excellent', 'father', 'Catherine', 'stance', 'marriage', 'made', 'most', 'sense', 'yet', 'wonder', 'why', 'Catherine', 'could', ""n't"", 'simply', 'wait', 'year', 'two', 'allow', 'Morris', 'Townsend', 'true', 'feelings', 'be', 'revealed', 'while', 'actually', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'treated', 'same', 'Hollywood', 'crap', 'end', 'luckily', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'So', 'was', 'nice', 'ending', 'other', 'hand', 'reason', 'points', 'film', 'found', 'film', 'awkward', 'watch', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'believable', 'more', 'natural', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'accepting', 'situation', 'when', 'better', 'ideas', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'proffered', 'film', 'asked', 'believe', 'Olivia', 'plain-looking', 'girl', 'plain', 'talents', 'Are', 'kidding', 'Olivia', 'freaking', 'de', 'Havilland', 'Find', 'somebody', 'else', 'much', 'more', 'more', 'plain', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'good', 'looking', 'guy', 'trying', 'get', 'supposedly', 'plain', 'woman', 'not', 'going', 'happen', 'really', 'drunk', 'think', 'Morris', 'know', 'good', 'two', 'minute', 'figure', 'out', 'motives', 'confirmation', 'intentions', 'speaking', 'feeling', 'fact', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'ending', 'surprise', 'was', 'just', 'wondering', 'Hollywood', 'would', 'cheat', 'Dr.', 'Sloper', 'may', 'have', 'felt', 'differently', 'daughter', 'expressed', 'feelings', 'daughter', 'still', 'side', 'Catherine', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'renounced', 'way', 'did', 'So', 'probably', 'will', 'haunt', 'end', 'regardless', 'expectations', 'comparisons', 'father', 'have', 'made', 'mother', 'People', 'have', 'faults', 'what', 'do', 'expect', 'worth', 'Dr.', 'Sloper', 'was', 'unrecognized', 'hero', 'film', 'situation', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'treated', 'differently', 'detours', 'Miriam', 'clearly', 'overacted', 'way', 'Heiress', 'Aunt', 'Penniman', 'Heiress', 'still', 'worth', 'watching', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'masterpiece']",N/A

None has altered my opinion that ""The Heiress"" is the best of them all.  Olivia de Havilland and Montgomery Clift-that alone is reason enough to see this.  But if it isn't, just read some of the reviews here and on other Internet sites.  It's called a classic for one simple reason-it's an excellent film.No doubt that the ensemble in ""The Heiress"" was a stroke of luck or genius.  Sir Ralph Richardson as Dr. Austin Sloper, with his perfect diction, embodies the Old New York patriarch-cold, stern, and overbearing.  Montgomery Clift, as the codger Morris Townsend, is devilishly handsome and irresistibly flirtatious as he sweeps Catherine Sloper off her feet, until he's revealed for what he truly is.  Miriam Hopkins, as the busybody Aunt Lavinia Penniman, projects the compassion borne of knowing what it's like to be lonely.  As outstanding as they all were, and as unerring and meticulous as William Wyler's direction was, this film belonged to Olivia de Havilland.  As Catherine Sloper, first meek, socially inept and cowering under her beastly father's rule, her transformation to a steely, wronged woman is flawless and heartbreaking.  Blessed with an excellent script, a compelling story, and a brilliant cast, ""The Heiress"" is a jewel.Some of my youthful imaginings were fuelled by Henry James and Edith Wharton books, and although my youth is long gone, my admiration endures.  ""Washington Square"" is timeless and remains one of James' best realist fictions, and this adaptation is the finest James on film, no disrespect intended to the Merchant-Ivory productions.

The script is one of the best to make it out of the studio system (comparable with ""All About Eve"", ""Sunset Boulevard"", ""Double Indemnity"", etc), perhaps because it is an adaptation of a Broadway play.This is definitely a film to own.

204262,A15IN5H4IATSHQ,6300183912,Classic film buff,"[5, 5]","Since playing Melanie Hamilton in ""Gone With the Wind"" in 1939, Olivia de Havilland had been steadily burnishing her craft through the 1940's in such films as ""Hold Back the Dawn"", ""To Each His Own"", ""The Dark Mirror"" and ""The Snake Pit"".  With her portrayal of Catherine Sloper in ""The Heiress"", she reached the pinnacle of her career, graduating to a cinema actress of the highest caliber right up there with Hepburn, Leigh, Davis and Bergman.  She deservedly won the Oscar, NY Film Critics Award and Golden Globe as Best Actress of 1949, and this is the performance for which she should be remembered.The story takes place circa 1850 within the handsome townhouse of eminent Doctor Austin Sloper (Ralph Richardson) located on fashionable Washington Square in New York City.  Dr. Sloper is a middle-aged widower obsessed with the memory of his beautiful, accomplished wife who died in childbirth of their only child Catherine (Olivia de Havilland). Now a young woman in her early twenties, Catherine though sweet natured, is plain in appearance, and timid and gauche in public. This is a direct result of her father's continuously holding up the impossible standard of her mother in unfavorable comparison.  Although an heiress, with  $10,000 per year inheritance from her mother, plus another $20,000 per year upon her father's death, she seems destined for spinsterhood.  Then at her cousin's engagement party she is introduced by her well meaning Aunt Lavinia (Miriam Hopkins) to a handsome, young gentleman with a charming manner, Morris Townsend (Montgomery Clift).  Over the next several days, he begins an ardent courtship of Catherine; she quickly falls deeply in love with him.  However when Morris asks her father for her hand in marriage he refuses.  Despite his accomplishments, Morris is poor, without any immediate prospects of employment, and Dr. Sloper suspects him of being a fortune hunter.  Catherine with newfound courage refuses to give Morris up, so Dr. Sloper tries delay, taking her on an extended trip to Europe, hoping the separation will cause either Catherine or Morris to change their mind.  It doesn't, upon their return, Catherine gently tells her father they will be married soon.  Dr. Sloper cruelly tells Catherine what he perceives to be the truth, the only thing she has to offer to Morris is her fortune she has nothing else.  Aghast by her father's spite, Catherine realizes he has never even liked her, much less loved her, and her feelings towards him change swiftly to anger and dislike.  She plans to elope with Morris that evening, but she tells Morris she will never reconcile with her father, therefore losing the potential inheritance from him, though she still has the annual inheritance from her mother.  Catherine is eagerly ready at the appointed time; Morris never shows up, he has jilted her, and she is shattered.  However is it because he's indeed mercenary, or he doesn't want to be the cause of her disinheritance, as he tells her years later when he reappears after her father's death?This is one of director William Wyler's masterpieces; he orchestrates all the various components, acting, writing, cinematography, music, sets and costumes to create a work of screen art.  Husband and wife team Ruth and Augustus Goetz adapted the screenplay from their stage play of the same name; it is extremely well written, improving on the source material the Henry James novella ""Washington Square.""  The black and white cinematography by Leo Tover is a subtle rendering of light and shadows, reminiscent of the old Victorian daguerreotypes.  John Meehan, Harry Horner and Emile Kuri collaborated on the art and set direction, being very true to the era particularly in the Sloper home which is elegantly but lifelessly furnished and appointed, there is very little warmth, accurately reflecting the austere, dominating nature of Dr. Sloper.  The lyrical and poignant musical score by renowned composer Aaron Copland effectively heightens the emotions of the story.  Finally, the costumes designed by Edith Head are not just faithful to the period, but in Catherine's case pivotal to her character.  All of the above were nominated for Oscars with Copland, Head, Meehan et al winning in their categories.Besides master director William Wyler's guidance, Ms. de Havilland was assisted in creating her portrait of Catherine by Edith Head for costumes and Wally Westmore for makeup.  Her natural prettiness was well disguised, and the severe tight hairstyles tell much about Catherine's repressed nature.  Catherine's gowns while well made and of fine materials, silks and satins, are just slightly off and unflattering to her.  For example the cherry red dress she wears to the engagement party is fussily trimmed and overly opulent; another dress is cut very tightly in the bodice as if emphasizing how uncomfortable she is with herself.  Only after her father's death does Catherine physical appearance soften, ironically as her character has hardened, she becomes more attractive, as if she is finally free to become her own woman.  Ms. De Havilland taps the rich vein of her talent in her dramatic journey from the naive ugly duckling to the coolly self-possessed dignified woman by the film's end.  Her voice modulation from the light uncertain treble that reflects Catherine's insecurity to the lower harsh tones colored with bitterness after she has been doubly betrayed is skillfully executed.  She breaks your heart in the scene where she is waiting for a Morris who will never arrive, since Catherine at this time is so emotionally vulnerable like a bud that has just started to open it's petals only to be killed by a frost.  The title line of this review is an anguished cry from her heart, and the scene where she haltingly climbs the stairs back to the prison of her room Ms. De Havilland makes unforgettable.  She brings such depth to Catherine showing the lovely generous nature that is within her, and that she tries to express, since she has been emotionally starved for love since birth.  The viewer is saddened by her transformation to the glacial, scarred woman who has a terrible strength since she has survived the worst that could happen to her.  Her famous line so memorably rendered is completely understandable,  ""Yes, I can be very cruel.  I have been taught by masters!""Ralph Richardson as the icy, detached Dr. Sloper is superb.  He shows the unhealthy fixation Dr. Sloper has with his dead wife that has ruined his and Catherine's chances for happiness.  There is the barely hidden dislike and resentment he feels for poor Catherine who he sees as robbing him of this treasure, that finally issues forth when he maliciously tells Catherine his true opinion of her.  His total contempt for her is expressed in the line ""...You embroider neatly"", where he distastefully curdles the syllables in ""embroider"".  Yet this is not a stock character of a villain, and Mr. Richardson brings many shades into this complex individual.  Mr. Richardson even evokes pity for this man who tries too late when he is dying to gain his daughter's affections, and comes to the awful realization of the monster he has created when Catherine ruthlessly rebuffs him, and dispassionately severs any hope of a reconciliation.Some said Montgomery Clift was too modern for Morris Townsend, I don't think so, but he does seem a little young for Catherine.  Still, he does have the requisite comeliness and charisma to dazzle Catherine, and he is very adept in suggesting the ambiguity in Morris, is he really a fortune hunter or does he truly care for Catherine? The viewer is left to draw his own conclusions.Brief nods of approval to Miriam Hopkins as Aunt Lavinia Penniman, Dr. Sloper's widowed sister, who is very superficial yet does truly care for Catherine and want her happiness, Betty Linley who has a gentle dignity as Morris' widowed older sister, Mrs. Montgomery, and Selena Royle as Elizabeth Almond, Dr. Sloper's other sister who tries to help both Dr. Sloper and Catherine with sensible advice.  Lastly I don't want to forget Vanessa Brown as Maria, the young tenderhearted Irish maid who seems truly bewildered by this dysfunctional family.In other reviews the movie has been lauded as one of the best movies about revenge for spurned love. While true, I think the importance of ""The Heiress"" is this is a cautionary tale of the irreparable damage that can happen in a family as a result of emotional abuse, and a lesson that can never be emphasized enough.",5,"""No, No, Morris must take hold of me!

Finally released on DVD nearly six decades after its original release, the story still resonates as a piercing study in betrayal and cruelty. Set in 1849 New York, the focus is on shy, retiring and hopelessly plain Catherine Sloper, a spinster-in-the-making living a sheltered life with her wealthy physician father, Dr. Austin Sloper. Mainly through insinuation and cutting remarks, he denigrates Catherine for not being the glamorous, beautiful woman that her mother was before her death. With her self-esteem practically nil, she meets Morris Townsend, a handsome suitor and something of a spendthrift. Quite the worldly seducer, he proposes to Catherine, but her father is convinced that Morris is only after her inheritance. This conflict sets in play a transformation in Catherine that has her evolve into a character of strength and surprising cunning.The writing is sharp and observant with a compelling last act almost Shakespearean in impact. An effectively deglamorized Olivia de Havilland is perfectly cast as Catherine, capturing the guileless insecurity in her character before palpably recognizing her utter disappointment in the two men from whom she most sought approval and love. It's almost amusing to hear her voice discernibly dip in pitch with the transformation. A young, vital Montgomery Clift slips into Morris so well that he brings unexpected complexity to his character's rather suspicious motivation for courting Catherine. Two masterful veterans round out the superb cast: Ralph Richardson, who brilliantly lets the bombast of Dr. Sloper curdle into a pool of regret, and Miriam Hopkins as Catherine's fussy, lonely Aunt Lavinia concerned only that her niece may lose her one chance at marital bliss. Aaron Copland wrote the bold, characteristic music score, while Edith Head designed the period costumes and Harry Horner brought mid-19th century New York to life in the details of the sets. The 2007 DVD contains a mostly clean print transfer with the only extras being an effusive introduction by Turner Movie Classics' Robert Osborne and the original theatrical trailer.",5,"Finally on DVD, Wyler and de Havilland Etch an Incisive Portrait of Betrayal and Emotional Revenge",1171843200,"02 19, 2007",2007,2408,"['Just', 'did', 'Best', 'Years', 'Lives', 'three', 'years', 'earlier', 'legendary', 'filmmaker', 'William', 'Wyler', 'innate', 'grasp', 'intimate', 'human', 'drama', 'deserved', '1949', 'classic', 'well-honed', 'adaptation', 'play', 'written', 'writers', 'Augustus', 'Ruth', 'Goetz', 'based', 'Henry', 'James', 'Washington', 'Square', 'Finally', 'released', 'DVD', 'nearly', 'six', 'decades', 'original', 'release', 'story', 'still', 'piercing', 'study', 'betrayal', 'cruelty', 'Set', '1849', 'New', 'York', 'focus', 'shy', 'retiring', 'hopelessly', 'plain', 'Catherine', 'Sloper', 'spinster-in-the-making', 'living', 'sheltered', 'life', 'wealthy', 'physician', 'father', 'Dr.', 'Austin', 'Sloper', 'Mainly', 'insinuation', 'cutting', 'remarks', 'Catherine', 'not', 'being', 'glamorous', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'mother', 'was', 'death', 'self-esteem', 'practically', 'nil', 'Morris', 'Townsend', 'handsome', 'suitor', 'something', 'spendthrift', 'worldly', 'seducer', 'Catherine', 'father', 'convinced', 'Morris', 'only', 'inheritance', 'conflict', 'play', 'transformation', 'Catherine', 'evolve', 'character', 'strength', 'surprising', 'cunning.The', 'writing', 'sharp', 'observant', 'compelling', 'last', 'act', 'almost', 'Shakespearean', 'impact', 'effectively', 'deglamorized', 'Olivia', 'de', 'Havilland', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Catherine', 'capturing', 'guileless', 'insecurity', 'character', 'palpably', 'recognizing', 'utter', 'disappointment', 'two', 'men', 'whom', 'most', 'sought', 'approval', 'love', 'almost', 'amusing', 'hear', 'voice', 'discernibly', 'dip', 'pitch', 'transformation', 'young', 'vital', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'Morris', 'so', 'well', 'unexpected', 'complexity', 'character', 'rather', 'suspicious', 'motivation', 'courting', 'Catherine', 'Two', 'masterful', 'veterans', 'round', 'superb', 'cast', 'Ralph', 'Richardson', 'who', 'brilliantly', 'bombast', 'Dr.', 'Sloper', 'curdle', 'pool', 'regret', 'Miriam', 'Hopkins', 'Catherine', 'fussy', 'lonely', 'Aunt', 'Lavinia', 'concerned', 'only', 'niece', 'may', 'lose', 'one', 'chance', 'marital', 'bliss', 'Aaron', 'Copland', 'wrote', 'bold', 'characteristic', 'music', 'score', 'Edith', 'Head', 'designed', 'period', 'costumes', 'Harry', 'Horner', 'brought', 'mid-19th', 'century', 'New', 'York', 'life', 'details', 'sets', '2007', 'DVD', 'mostly', 'clean', 'print', 'transfer', 'only', 'extras', 'being', 'effusive', 'introduction', 'Turner', 'Movie', 'Classics', 'Robert', 'Osborne', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer']",N/A

204285,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,6300183912,Gregor von Kallahann,"[3, 3]","I'd certainly be curious to see WASHINGTON SQUARE, the more recent take on the Henry James tale on which this film is ultimately based.  I find Jennifer Jason Leigh to be an intriguing (if avowedly maverick) screen presence and would be curious to see her take on the character of Catherine Sloper.  But it's hard to imagine that it is any better than Olivia de Havilland's 1949 portrayal of the introverted, socially awkward heiress.(For that matter, I would have loved to have seen acclaimed stage actress Cherry Jones' performance in the revival of the Ruth and Augustus Goetz play which was the more direct source of the 1949 film.)De Havilland is a screen legend, of course, but contemporary viewers, who may not be that familiar with her work, may legitimately wonder if she was a great actress or more of a ""luminous screen prescence"" (not at all the same thing).  Well, if she were all about glamour and charisma, she never could have pulled off this role.  A striking woman in real life, she seems almost too physically attractive to effectively portray the initially mousey Catherine.  But, in real life, the socially maladroit are often objectively attractive.  What they lack are the social graces and poise necessary to function in society.  Should they somehow master those skills, well, you have your classic ""ugly duckling"" transformation tale.That is not quite the case with THE HEIRESS, however.  There is a striking transformation--what we might call in contemporary jargon, a kind of ""empowerment""--but it does not result in the heroine's emergence as a ""beautiful swan.""  More like a bird of prey.And it all makes perfect sense, emotionally and psychologically speaking.  For a ""pre-feminist"" work, THE HEIRESS lends itself perfectly to a feminist reading.  Caught between her demanding, emotionally unavailable father and a fortune-hunting suitor, Catherine seems initially to be almost helpless, a vulnerable wallflower who really does need her father's protection.  (We know he's remote, but as played by the great Ralph Richardson, he does not seem any more so--or any less kindly disposed to his daughter--than many another Victorian father.)But by the film's end, we see that he is, in many ways, as cruel an exploiter of his daughter's affections as the caddish suitor (skillfully played by a young Montgomery Clift) and maybe more so.  For as she reproaches her ailing father, quite literally before he takes to his death bed, the handsome young bounder at least offered her ""the illusion"" of love.But it's not that simple--or that melodramatic.  As another reviewer has noted, the story is a pas de trois (or a folie a trois) between Clift's conniving (but not totally unsympathetic) suitor, Richardson's stern (but not really totally unloving) father and the apparently vulnerable (but not totally naive, as it turns out) young woman.In the last analysis, it is actually Catherine's steely resolve to break relations with her father that leads to the tale's denouement.  Clift's ever-calculating Morris has always factored into the bargain an eventual reconciliation between father and daughter.  It is her determination never to return home and to break off all ties to her father that precipitates his abandoning her--not, as many seem to believe, her father's threat to disinherit her.Catherine's attempted flight from Washington Square is, in many ways, as significant a cultural break as Nora's actual abandonment of her ""doll's house.""  Fate decrees that she does not make that break:  it is her good fortune, in a sense, that she does not have to.  Whether she truly ""wins"" in any real sense remains something of an open question.  (Just as Nora's actual fate in the wide world is never revealed.)  But in Catherine's case, there is at least a sweet moment of revenge.  You can hardly fault her for savoring it.",5,Taught By Masters,1140307200,"02 19, 2006",2006,3849,"[""'d"", 'certainly', 'be', 'curious', 'see', 'WASHINGTON', 'SQUARE', 'more', 'recent', 'take', 'Henry', 'James', 'tale', 'film', 'ultimately', 'based', 'find', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'be', 'intriguing', 'avowedly', 'maverick', 'screen', 'presence', 'would', 'be', 'curious', 'see', 'take', 'character', 'Catherine', 'Sloper', 'hard', 'imagine', 'better', 'Olivia', 'de', 'Havilland', '1949', 'portrayal', 'introverted', 'socially', 'awkward', 'heiress', 'matter', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'have', 'seen', 'acclaimed', 'stage', 'actress', 'Cherry', 'Jones', 'performance', 'revival', 'Ruth', 'Augustus', 'Goetz', 'play', 'was', 'more', 'direct', 'source', '1949', 'film', 'De', 'Havilland', 'screen', 'legend', 'course', 'contemporary', 'viewers', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'familiar', 'work', 'may', 'legitimately', 'wonder', 'was', 'great', 'actress', 'more', 'luminous', 'screen', 'prescence', 'not', 'same', 'thing', 'Well', 'were', 'glamour', 'charisma', 'never', 'could', 'have', 'pulled', 'off', 'role', 'striking', 'woman', 'real', 'life', 'almost', 'too', 'physically', 'attractive', 'effectively', 'portray', 'initially', 'mousey', 'Catherine', 'real', 'life', 'socially', 'maladroit', 'are', 'often', 'objectively', 'attractive', 'What', 'lack', 'are', 'social', 'graces', 'poise', 'necessary', 'function', 'society', 'Should', 'somehow', 'master', 'skills', 'well', 'have', 'classic', 'ugly', 'duckling', 'transformation', 'tale.That', 'not', 'quite', 'case', 'THE', 'HEIRESS', 'however', 'striking', 'transformation', 'what', 'might', 'call', 'contemporary', 'jargon', 'kind', 'empowerment', 'not', 'result', 'heroine', 'emergence', 'beautiful', 'swan', 'More', 'bird', 'prey.And', 'perfect', 'sense', 'emotionally', 'psychologically', 'speaking', 'pre-feminist', 'work', 'THE', 'HEIRESS', 'perfectly', 'feminist', 'reading', 'Caught', 'demanding', 'emotionally', 'unavailable', 'father', 'fortune-hunting', 'suitor', 'Catherine', 'initially', 'be', 'almost', 'helpless', 'vulnerable', 'wallflower', 'who', 'really', 'need', 'father', 'protection', 'know', 'remote', 'played', 'great', 'Ralph', 'Richardson', 'not', 'seem', 'more', 'so', 'less', 'kindly', 'disposed', 'daughter', 'many', 'Victorian', 'father', 'film', 'end', 'see', 'many', 'ways', 'cruel', 'exploiter', 'daughter', 'affections', 'caddish', 'suitor', 'skillfully', 'played', 'young', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'maybe', 'more', 'so', 'ailing', 'father', 'quite', 'literally', 'death', 'bed', 'handsome', 'young', 'bounder', 'least', 'offered', 'illusion', 'love.But', 'not', 'that', 'simple', 'melodramatic', 'reviewer', 'noted', 'story', 'pas', 'trois', 'folie', 'trois', 'Clift', 'conniving', 'not', 'totally', 'unsympathetic', 'suitor', 'Richardson', 'stern', 'not', 'really', 'totally', 'unloving', 'father', 'apparently', 'vulnerable', 'not', 'totally', 'naive', 'out', 'young', 'woman.In', 'last', 'analysis', 'actually', 'Catherine', 'steely', 'resolve', 'break', 'relations', 'father', 'tale', 'denouement', 'Clift', 'ever-calculating', 'Morris', 'always', 'factored', 'bargain', 'eventual', 'reconciliation', 'father', 'daughter', 'determination', 'never', 'return', 'home', 'break', 'off', 'ties', 'father', 'abandoning', 'not', 'many', 'seem', 'believe', 'father', 'threat', 'disinherit', 'her.Catherine', 'attempted', 'flight', 'Washington', 'Square', 'many', 'ways', 'significant', 'cultural', 'break', 'Nora', 'actual', 'abandonment', 'doll', 'house', 'Fate', 'decrees', 'not', 'make', 'break', 'good', 'fortune', 'sense', 'not', 'have', 'Whether', 'truly', 'wins', 'real', 'sense', 'something', 'open', 'question', 'Just', 'Nora', 'actual', 'fate', 'wide', 'world', 'never', 'revealed', 'Catherine', 'case', 'least', 'sweet', 'moment', 'revenge', 'can', 'hardly', 'fault', 'savoring']",N/A

It's the story of a plain and awkward girl who finds her love abused by not only a fortune hunter who does not  love her, but also by her widowed father who can barely hide the  disappointment and contempt he feels toward her.  As the awkward girl,  Olivia deHavilland gives what must be one of the most perfect performances  delivered on film by an actress.  Using everything including the tone in  her voice, posture, slight clumsiness, and her eyes, she flawlessly  portrays the character's evolution from innocence to bitterness.  She's  amazing.  Montgomery Clift portrays her would be lover, and he seems out of  place in the film, but upon reflection, it works because his character  wants to move up in the world, using deHavilland and her money as his  means.  He's not supposed to fit in.  Ralph Richardson plays her father,  and he's a strong presence in every scene.  Miriam Hopkins plays her  meddling aunt, and she provides some amusement amidst the emotional  turmoil.  William Wyler once again directs a detailed, mature film, and the  musical score by Aaron Copland perfectly fits the film.  The final scene is  memorable, as are some of the lines such as when Richardson puts down  deHavilland for wearing a red dress like her mother used to, saying that  her mother &quot;dominated the colour&quot;.  I don't want to be sexist,  but as a man I admire the film for it's detail and performances.  However,  the women I know who have seen the movie react very emotionally  and  strongly to the story, because I suspect it hits a particular chord.

204289,A106016KSI0YQ,6300183912,Jay Dickson,"[121, 126]","The unsatisfying film adaptation of James'  WASHINGTON SQUARE starring Jennifer Jason-Leigh only shows how wise William Wyler was to film the Goetz's stage version rather than retain James's original storyline. James's little novel about an Old New York heiress, Catherine Sloper caught in a tug-of-war between her heartless father and her fortune-hunting suitor (Morris Townsend) ends with a very Jamesian ending: Catherine learns to grow beyond her father's and Morris's petty battle, and in so doing shows her superiority to both of them. In adapting this novel for the stage, the Goetzes decided that such an ending (admittedly sublime on the printed page) would be hard to do onstage, and instead retain the Balzacian melodramatic air James drew upon by allowing Catherine her vengeance on father and Morris alike. The result is spellbinding. William Wyler crafted out of this melodrama one of the most hard-to-forget films of the Hollywood era, a masterful little exercise in emotional cruelty that has been championed by (among others) Martin Scorsese, who regularly lists it as one of the five films that most influenced his own work.The sets are superb, and there's a lovely film score by Aaron Copland. But what really makes the film is the acting. There are only four major performers--Olivia De Havilland as Catherine, Sir Ralph Richardson as her father, Montgomery Clift as Morris, and Miriam Hopkins as Aunt Penniman--and all four give their best performances ever here; they seem to spur one another on to better work than you'd imagine them capable of doing. De Havilland is the one who most stands out: at first, though suitably old, she seems too beautiful to be effective as Catherine. But her fine portrayal of Catherine's crippling shyness makes her unattractiveness to both Morris and Dr. Sloper exceptionally believable. When Catherine undergoes her awful education, De Havilland very bravely allows herself to change a great deal so that while she's still Catherine you're aware of how radically she's changed. The highlight of the entire film is Catherine's showdown with her father, when she more than outmaneuvers him and utterly devastates him: De Havilland here does some of the acting the screen has ever seen. The scene begins with De Havilland's simple words, ""Morris deserted me,"" which she delivers with about a hundred different levels of feeling at once, from shame at herself for being fooled, to almost bemused exasperation at Morris's shallowness, to fury at her father. It ends with her dramatic (and surprisingly frightening) declaration to her broken father, ""That's it , Father--you'll never know, will you?"", which leaves you aware not only of how thoroughly Catherine has beaten her father but at what a cost to her own soul. I can't imagine even one of the great stage actors doing more with this scene than De Havilland does.

Here they adapted their stage work for the film director William Wyler who gave it a handsome production & his usual sensitive direction.  Perhaps Wyler had an affinity for literary adaptations for he certainly had successes with a number of them:  Two versions of THE CHILDREN'S HOUR (the first was called THESE THREE), THE LITTLE FOXES & WUTHERING HEIGHTS to name a few.  Here Wyler's careful attention to detail really pays off.  Within minutes you know all you need of the time, place & society of these characters, their relationships to one another & the larger society in which they move, what that society expects of them & what they expect of that society & each other.  Wyler carries out this rather delicate balancing act beautifully.  The actors here give wonderful, full rounded performances.  Miriam Hopkins who was in both versions of THE CHILDREN'S HOUR plays the Aunt.  She may be the Polonius in the Sloper court but she stays this side of being tiresome.  Olivia de Havilland makes a lovely Catherine & when she feels loved she seems to glow through her skin.  The Morris Townsend of Montgomery Clift is dream casting & he's as perfect as makes no matter.

She darts around the dance scene, trying to make sure her wallflower niece has enough men's names signed up to the tiny dance card that hangs on a gold string from her wrist.  Inevitably she gets caught up in the music herself, and through Hopkins' sensitive movements you can watch her character disappear for a moment to the waltzes of her own youth, before remembering and ""coming to"" again to see to her beloved niece.  William Wyler, the director, is said to have driven most actors mad with his insistent need to film scenes dozens of times, over and over, will he got some particulat nuance that he wanted out of their performance.  And yet actor sloved him once they saw the results.  And he was loyal too, sometimes providing the only work an actor might hope to get after his star had fallen for whatever reason (and it happens to nearly every actor).  Most of Miriam Hopkins' later parts--the best of them at any rate--were undertaken for Wyler, for whom at the peak of her stardom she had made THESE THREE back in 1936.  There was her wonderful Lavinia here, in THE HEIRESS, a luminous portrayal indeed; then there was a darker part as Olivier's wife in CARRIE (1952); finally she was the unbelievably selfish and egocentric Aunt Lily in THE CHILDREN'S HOUR--a range that shows her getting worse and worse as she got older, so perhaps Wyler wasn't entirely good for her after all.But here, at least, Hopkins fans have little to complain of.  Though only 14 years older than De Havilland, in movie terms she was a whole other generation.  De Havilland was maybe 31 or 32 when she played Catherine Sloper and, although she's no girl, she was still able to call up some girlish naivete and whole-heartedness while playing the scenes in which she falls headlong for young Morris Townsend.  When he plays her mother's piano for her you can watch her heart leap up into her throat: an astonishing display of the physical, nearly Actors Studio response De Havilland puts into play when working with Clift.And oh, that wonderful Copland score, I can't say enough about it.  There are some scores which sweep you away and let their magnificence do all the ""directing,"" and then there are the simple, lovely ones like THE HEIRESS which never detract, which only illuminate, the performances they undershadow.  There's a grand CD of Copland's movie music by the St Louis Symphony Orchestra, in which THE HEIRESS score is miniaturized down to something under ten minutes.  Listen to it, and everything precious about this great film will come to you via osmosis and through Copland's tonal color.",5,"Needed, a DVD Transfer",1122940800,"08 2, 2005",2005,2804,"['Miriam', 'Hopkins', 'no', 'longer', 'young', 'lines', 'age', 'gathered', 'mouth', 'expressive', 'huge', 'eyes', 'first', 'part', 'THE', 'HEIRESS', 'firefly', 'impression', 'Catherine', 'loving', 'aunt', 'dance', 'scene', 'trying', 'make', 'sure', 'wallflower', 'niece', 'enough', 'men', 'names', 'signed', 'up', 'tiny', 'dance', 'card', 'gold', 'string', 'wrist', 'Inevitably', 'caught', 'up', 'music', 'herself', 'Hopkins', 'sensitive', 'movements', 'can', 'watch', 'character', 'disappear', 'moment', 'waltzes', 'own', 'youth', 'remembering', 'coming', 'again', 'see', 'beloved', 'niece', 'William', 'Wyler', 'director', 'said', 'have', 'driven', 'most', 'actors', 'mad', 'insistent', 'need', 'film', 'scenes', 'dozens', 'times', 'will', 'got', 'particulat', 'nuance', 'wanted', 'performance', 'yet', 'actor', 'sloved', 'once', 'saw', 'results', 'was', 'loyal', 'too', 'sometimes', 'providing', 'only', 'work', 'actor', 'might', 'hope', 'get', 'star', 'had', 'fallen', 'reason', 'nearly', 'actor', 'Most', 'Miriam', 'Hopkins', 'later', 'parts', 'best', 'rate', 'were', 'undertaken', 'Wyler', 'whom', 'peak', 'stardom', 'had', 'made', 'THESE', 'THREE', 'back', '1936', 'was', 'wonderful', 'Lavinia', 'here', 'THE', 'HEIRESS', 'luminous', 'portrayal', 'indeed', 'then', 'was', 'darker', 'part', 'Olivier', 'wife', 'CARRIE', '1952', 'finally', 'was', 'unbelievably', 'selfish', 'egocentric', 'Aunt', 'Lily', 'THE', 'CHILDREN', 'HOUR', 'range', 'getting', 'worse', 'worse', 'got', 'older', 'perhaps', 'Wyler', 'was', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'good', 'all.But', 'here', 'least', 'Hopkins', 'fans', 'have', 'little', 'complain', 'only', '14', 'years', 'older', 'De', 'Havilland', 'movie', 'terms', 'was', 'whole', 'other', 'generation', 'De', 'Havilland', 'was', 'maybe', '31', '32', 'when', 'played', 'Catherine', 'Sloper', 'girl', 'was', 'still', 'able', 'call', 'up', 'girlish', 'naivete', 'whole-heartedness', 'playing', 'scenes', 'headlong', 'young', 'Morris', 'Townsend', 'When', 'mother', 'piano', 'can', 'watch', 'heart', 'up', 'throat', 'astonishing', 'display', 'physical', 'nearly', 'Actors', 'Studio', 'response', 'De', 'Havilland', 'play', 'when', 'working', 'Clift.And', 'oh', 'wonderful', 'Copland', 'score', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'are', 'scores', 'sweep', 'away', 'let', 'magnificence', 'do', 'directing', 'then', 'are', 'simple', 'lovely', 'ones', 'THE', 'HEIRESS', 'never', 'detract', 'only', 'illuminate', 'performances', 'undershadow', 'grand', 'CD', 'Copland', 'movie', 'music', 'St', 'Louis', 'Symphony', 'Orchestra', 'THE', 'HEIRESS', 'score', 'miniaturized', 'down', 'something', 'ten', 'minutes', 'Listen', 'everything', 'precious', 'great', 'film', 'will', 'come', 'osmosis', 'Copland', 'tonal', 'color']",N/A

Williams,"[3, 3]","How could I pass up this movie with an Academy Award winning performance by de Havilland, costumes by Edith Head, and 5-star glowing reviews bursting with quotes such as ""finest work ever""? The hour and 56 minutes of humor, love, drama, deception is fully absorbing. Suspenseful plot twists continue right through to the end.In this ""period piece,"" Catherine Sloper (Olivia de Havilland) masterfully portrays a plain-face introverted heiress constantly overlooked by young men due to her awkward social skills. Her widowed father Dr. Austin Sloper (Ralph Richardson) frequently makes unfavorable comparisons between Catherine and her late mother, which reinforce her insecurities.To everyone's surprise, a handsome, well-spoken Morris Townsend (Montgomery Clift) takes immediate interest in the heiress. No specific employment opportunities naturally leads the protective father to suspect a gold digging wolf is in the hen house. In response to the overwhelming attention, with no other prospects, Catherine falls deeply in love with her young suitor. Can Dr. Sloper protect his daughter from what he perceives to be potential abuse without alienating himself in the process? Which is stronger, love, money, or perhaps the love of money? THE HEIRESS tests the limits in a triangulated battle of each.Trivial observations: The Sloper's house looks very much like the one used five years earlier inGASLIGHT(1944). Ralph Richardson bears a striking resemblance to Don Rafael Montero (Stuart Wilson) fromTHE MASK OF ZORRO(1998). Miriam Hopkins, who delivers an animated performance as Lavinia Penniman, later appears inTHE CHILDREN'S HOUR(1961). I am quite familiar with Joan Fontaine's arsenal of facial expressions from REBECCA (1940) &SUSPICION(1941) but was not aware that her sister, Olivia de Havilland, was arguably even more capable. They are the first sisters to win Oscars and the first to be Oscar nominated in the same year (1942).Prepare yourself for a great movie -- no wild action or special effects -- just great acting. Pay close attention; the accents are not too heavy, but when combined with archaic sentence structure, a few phrases may go over your head. The DVD is practically void of extras. There is a brief, easy-to-miss Osborne introduction and a theatrical trailer. Though the movie includes bookmarks, a graphical scene selection option is absent.

204305,AD2BIAIH78QI5,6300183912,"Linda McDonnell ""TutorGal""","[11, 13]","One of the best lines in this adaptation of Henry James's novella, &quot;Washington Square&quot;, uttered by Catherine (Olivia de Havilland) to her Aunt Lavinia (Miriam Hopkins). And the master in question is her father Dr. Sloper (Ralph Richardson). Olivia de Havilland won an Oscar for her portrayal of the plain, painfully shy Catherine Sloper, an heiress being courted by handsome and charming Morris Townsend (Montgomery Clift), who may or may not be a fortune hunter. At least that's the contention of Dr. Sloper, who has a considerable fortune and a stately home on Washington Square. Dr. Sloper has everything, it seems, except compassion for his daughter, the daughter he holds to blame for his beautiful wife's childbed death. The daughter is the antithesis of the graceful woman he describes to his sisters. Things come to a head when Catherine and Morris announce their engagement, with heartbreaking results.Oscar notwithstanding, I think Olivia de Havilland's Catherine is much better in the first half of the film, before the Great Turning Point that defines the rest of her life. After that, I found her turnabout to have little relation to the preceding characterization--I could not see this as the logical outgrowth from that personality.Montgomery Clift is very good as the clever Morris--one really can't make up one's mind about him until the climax of the film. Miriam Hopkins does a good job as the romantically inclined Aunt Lavinia who is enjoying Morris's courtship of Catherine vicariously.But for my money, the best performance in the whole piece is Sir Ralph Richardson's Dr. Sloper, who fairly drips with poorly concealed contempt for his inadequate daughter. When I watch this movie--and I have, several times--it is always for him. My favorite scene is one in which he doesn't even talk; it's when he has just learned of the engagement, and he sits alone in the parlor, contemplating what action to take. It shows the psychological complexity of the doctor, who is not merely a hating machine, but capable of some despair.Don't wait for your inheritance to come through to watch &quot;The Heiress&quot;--make it your business to do so today.",5,&quot;I Can Be Very Cruel--I Have Been Taught by Masters&quot;,998265600,"08 20, 2001",2001,2174,"['One', 'best', 'lines', 'adaptation', 'Henry', 'James', 'novella', 'quot', 'Washington', 'Square', 'quot', 'uttered', 'Catherine', 'Olivia', 'de', 'Havilland', 'Aunt', 'Lavinia', 'Miriam', 'Hopkins', 'master', 'question', 'father', 'Dr.', 'Sloper', 'Ralph', 'Richardson', 'Olivia', 'Havilland', 'won', 'Oscar', 'portrayal', 'plain', 'painfully', 'shy', 'Catherine', 'Sloper', 'heiress', 'being', 'courted', 'handsome', 'charming', 'Morris', 'Townsend', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'fortune', 'hunter', 'least', 'contention', 'Dr.', 'Sloper', 'who', 'considerable', 'fortune', 'stately', 'home', 'Washington', 'Square', 'Dr.', 'Sloper', 'everything', 'compassion', 'daughter', 'daughter', 'blame', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'childbed', 'death', 'daughter', 'antithesis', 'graceful', 'woman', 'sisters', 'Things', 'come', 'head', 'when', 'Catherine', 'Morris', 'announce', 'engagement', 'heartbreaking', 'results.Oscar', 'notwithstanding', 'think', 'Olivia', 'de', 'Havilland', 'Catherine', 'much', 'better', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'Great', 'Turning', 'Point', 'rest', 'life', 'found', 'turnabout', 'have', 'little', 'relation', 'preceding', 'characterization', 'could', 'not', 'see', 'logical', 'outgrowth', 'personality.Montgomery', 'Clift', 'very', 'good', 'clever', 'Morris', 'one', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'one', 'mind', 'climax', 'film', 'Miriam', 'Hopkins', 'good', 'job', 'romantically', 'inclined', 'Aunt', 'Lavinia', 'who', 'enjoying', 'Morris', 'courtship', 'Catherine', 'vicariously.But', 'money', 'best', 'performance', 'whole', 'piece', 'Sir', 'Ralph', 'Richardson', 'Dr.', 'Sloper', 'who', 'fairly', 'poorly', 'concealed', 'contempt', 'inadequate', 'daughter', 'When', 'watch', 'movie', 'have', 'several', 'times', 'always', 'favorite', 'scene', 'one', ""n't"", 'even', 'talk', 'when', 'just', 'learned', 'engagement', 'alone', 'parlor', 'contemplating', 'what', 'action', 'take', 'psychological', 'complexity', 'doctor', 'who', 'not', 'merely', 'hating', 'machine', 'capable', 'despair.Do', ""n't"", 'wait', 'inheritance', 'come', 'watch', 'quot', 'Heiress', 'quot', 'make', 'business', 'do', 'so', 'today']",N/A
204306,AG8U6F6226GBZ,6300183912,Lotte,"[1, 3]","I disagree with the characterization of many of the reviews here.  I didn't see the father as a heartless man, but as a father trying to protect his overly dull and reclusive daughter from a fortune hunter.  At first meeting, he seems very happy that his daughter, Catherine, has found a suitor and welcomes him cordially, but after talking to him he discovers that he is a selfish fortune hunter, who blew his own smaller fortune on himself, a mercenary, who cares only for money, and nothing for his daughter or anyone else, even his own aunt who has several children and unselfishly raised him.The fourth character in the story is Catherine's bubbly but dimwitted aunt, who knowing that Maurice is only after her niece's fortune still encourages her to accept him.  Her attitude is ""better a fortune hunting husband, than no husband at all.""  Furthermore, she really likes Maurice.  When father and daughter take a trip to Europe, the aunt receives him at her brother's home, which she should not have done, and they have friendly chats, drink wine, and play board games together,  She knows what he's up to, but doesn't care. He is so affable and pleasant, she claims she thinks he will make her lonely niece happy. But it shows through that she hopes by helping the marriage, she will get some of the inheritance from Maurice herself.  Doubtful.  Maurice had no love for Catherine, the aunt, and Catherine, once the blinders were off,  would have soon realized that she married a selfish and deceitful man who cared nothing for her but her fortune.Though the father, a physician, occasionally brings up the admiration he had for his late wife,  Catherine feels rejected by it. I have read in other reviews that his wife died upon the birth of Catherine and that he's always bringing up her mother.  I certainly missed that part. That he loved her mother, I understood, that she was gracious and beautiful, I got that part, but that he hated his daughter because his wife died in childbirth, that I must have missed.In any case, one get's the feeling that she is patently jealous of her late mother and her father's love of her.  But her father seems a likable chap to me, and only seems hopeful that his dowdy daughter might show off a bit of friendliness and some outgoing characteristics.  He would like her to be somewhat gracious, and at least a little sociable, but she shows none of those things, embroidering her life away.  She is boring, dreary and appears frightened most of the time.  We don't really know why.  Her father seems pleasant and genial enough. He treats her well.  Of course, we don't know the background of her childhood, as it isn't shown.Catherine's father is frustrated, however, that his daughter is taken in by a handsome but ruthless fortune hunter, and with good reason.  He is trying to protect her from Maurice, a man who would undoubtedly take all her inheritance, squander it (as he did with his own inheritance) and leave her when it was gone.  He sees his daughter as a young simple minded woman who would let him do it.  It exasperates him with good reason.  But, Maurice brings her out of herself,  His lovemaking causes her to suddenly become alive and happy. But how long would it last?  Not very long, I'm afraid.  Her father sees that clearly.The show down comes when her father sees Catherine still wants him no matter what his motives.  He finally tells her in a moment of exasperation what he thinks of her, and she is crushed.  But so is he. I don't see the father as cruel or heartless.  I see him as a very frustrated father trying to protect his obvious boring, stupid daughter who has no chance of finding a husband because of her extreme introverted personality, and her plain looks.  Although Olivia DeHaviland is an attractive woman, she is made to look very plain and spinster like in the movie.  Ralph Richardson was great in the part.The result of her father's outburst and Maurise's desertion, after she tells him she has rejected her father's inheritance, causes a change in Catherine, not that she could get much worse.  She becomes so bitter that even when her dying father calls for her, she refuses to go.  She blames him for everything, and takes no responsibility for his concerned behavior on herself.  Some years later,  after the death of her father, Maurice returns from CA where he has been tying to make some money. He doesn't.  If he did, he wouldn't have returned.  Once again, he tries to make love to Catherine. She appears to accept him and agrees to marry him, but she lies on purpose.  When he comes for her she doesn't answer the door, and leaves him pounding on it, then goes up the stairs in triumph.We wonder if now that this period of her life is over, she will become more friendly and outgoing, but at least we are pretty sure she has become no wiser.The problem with the story is, as I see it, is that we don't know anything about Catherine's youth.  I did not see a mean father.  I saw a father who was in love with his late wife (a good virtue) but not a man who harmed his daughter by being in love with her mother. He was nice around her.  What I saw was a daughter who was very jealous and envious of her mother and her father's affections towards her mother.  Her father gave his daughter the best education, clothes, money and the best of everything. He seemed kind to her if perhaps concerned about her forlorn behavior.  All he wanted for his daughter was that she make a good marriage with a man who cared for her and could at least support her. Instead he realized the man that wanted his daughter was nothing more than a fortune hunter who cared for no one but himself.  No father wants that.  He saw a man who, had some money but never helped his foster mother with 4 children who had unselfishly raised him and who needed it. He saw a man who spent all his small fortune on himself.  He saw an unhappy but predictable future for his daughter.  He was right, and she was selfish and jealous.",5,Great film,1159574400,"09 30, 2006",2006,5996,"['disagree', 'characterization', 'many', 'reviews', 'here', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'father',

204310,A1D90MKRWB0ZKP,6300183912,March boy,"[0, 1]","Academy award nominations: Picture, Director-William Wyler, Supporting Actor-Ralph Richardson and Black and White Cinematography.Wins: Leading Actress-Olivia de Havilland, Black and White Set Design, Black and White Costume Design and Original Score.March Boy nominations: Black and White Set DesignWins: Supporting Actor-Ralph Richardson and Black and White Costume Design.I know I'm going to be in the minority because I see Olivia de Havilland's second Academy Award win is held in high esteem around here and it's just an esteem I don't share. I just watched the Heiress for the fifth time and while I was quite taken by her characterization of Catherine Sloper when I first watched it, after a recent viewing she began to wear on me. To me, her performance lacks subtlety. I usually love performances of women that start out silly and nave and slowly mature. I can see that with Audrey Hepburn in War and Peace, Romola Garai in Emma and Kate Winslet in Sense and Sensibility. However, I feel like something is not right with de Havilland. I can't exactly put my finger on what it is. She has the right face, personality and demeanor and looks positively smashing in 18th century gowns--especially the one at the end--and to be frank she conveys the emotions of Catherine very well with her face, especially her eyes--but what annoys me is that she uses two kinds of voices---in the first half as the silly, shy, namby pamby girl--she's got this breathy, high, hysterical cutie pie voice begging you to go ""AWWW. She's so ADORABLE."" And then in the next half after being thwarted in love she has a slow, low, raspy, hollow, Lauren Bacall smoker's voice. There are no shades of gray in her performance, no foreshadowing of the fully accomplished, wiser woman that is to come. She is either black or white. It's a two note performance that grates on my nerves. I felt like Mister Tee in the Unofficial Academy Award Discussion Board (Best Actress 1949 page) took the words out of my mouth when he likened her to ""A switch turned on and off."" I once read (I can't remember where) that William Wyler took up to thirty takes to get `just the right expression/gesture"" from her so maybe he overanalyzed the character and is partly to blame for guiding her in this direction.It doesn't help matters either that she has to play off the unforgivably bad performance of Montgomery Clift as her suitor Morris. I liked Clift in A Place in the Sun, From Here to Eternity (I don't like the story in FHTE but I have to admit he was great there) and Judgment at Nuremburg but here he seems to have no emotions. He has only two expressions--a seedy smile and a deadpan, blank, horizontal mouth--and his weak, breathy voice is unappealing. I don't blame him one bit for walking out of the theater at the premiere. I would have been totally disgusted too.Also, the movie has an overall, claustrophobic feel like a stage play instead of a movie. There's not a lot of spacious outside scenes and the camera work in the house is just plain dull--master shot, over the shoulder, close up, master shot, over the shoulder, etc.) William Wyler has to shoulder on some of the blame for that too.Ralph Richardson, on the other hand acts the socks off them as the grouchy, sarcastic father who tells it like it is. His subtle facial expressions (like when his daughter announces her engagement, the twinkle in his eye at the party when he says ""Remember her mother, Liz? Her mother who had so much grace and gaiety?"" and the constipated look when Morris says goodbye to Catherine on the ship) are amazing and he delivers his lines with such crisp speed, wit and dramatic flourish that I found myself liking this character the best even though the script obviously didn't want me to. How Olivia di Havilland managed to win an Oscar and not Richardson when he runs rings around her just totally baffles me.Miriam Hopkins is excellent as the goofy, air-headed aunt and can be stupid and annoying in a very funny sort of way. I cracked up when she makes her speech towards the end. ""Oh Catherine! We have him back! I was afraid you would turn him away. But I have faith in love like this. I hope I always stay romantic. And you know what? You are much more romantic than you know!""Also the pacing is very sluggish at times. Some scenes go on way too long. For instance, when Catherine says goodnight to her father after telling him about her engagement she rushes up the stairs to tell her aunt. After she leaves the room, we see the doctor looks confused, tired and worried; he obviously doesn't want just ANYONE marrying his daughter. But after she goes up the stairs we get another close up of him lying on the couch with the same concerned look. Catherine wakes her aunt up to tell her about her engagement and the aunt congratulates her and it looks like the scene is going to end and move on to the next day. But NO! We get a THIRD close up of the doctor! We already saw his reaction after Catherine left the room. We don't need to be beat over the head with it three times. Come on Wyler! Wrap up the scene and move on!I will say, the storyline was very engaging and the subject matter thought provoking. I liked how the script treated the father/daughter relationship very carefully and sensitively to where I could see the full dimension of their characters. I could see they both had their faults and virtues and even though they have a major fall-out they do not exactly hate each other. It would have been so much easier to make Dr. Sloper hate Catherine and Catherine love him then hate him at the end but because of the careful balance of the script I could see they weren't merely on one side of the love/hate see-saw--they were just teetering in the middle. It certainly has a message: be wise in matters of the heart and you cannot unsay an unkind work and that conclusion where she tricks Morris to show him she's not dumb enough to fall for him twice since now she knows him inside and out was VERY satisfying.Taken as a whole, this isn't a bad adaption of Ruth and Augustus Goetz's play but it could have been better.",3,Is it just me or does Olivia

204311,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,6300183912,Martin Asiner,"[78, 82]","THE HEIRESS is a surprisingly complex drama of paternal brutality, starry-eyed love, and bitter revenge.  Director William Wyler adapted Henry James' short novel WASHINGTON SQUARE and during the film's nearly two hours managed to convey the collision of conflicting dreams.  Each of the three major characters: Ralph Richardson as Doctor Sloper, Olivia de Havilland as his dowdy daughter Catherine Sloper, and Montgomery Clift as the mercenary Morris Townsend all dance a three-partnered minuet in which emotional ties clasp and unclasp in ways that are suggested more by gentle innuendo than by overt deed.  Doctor Sloper is a uncaring brute who rules his house with vicious wit and the threat of withheld inheritance.  To him, there are two kinds of men: those who have already made their mark in the world (like him) and those who have not (like Morris) but seek to obtain it deceitfully through marriage to plain but rich women (like Catherine).  The more Sloper puts Catherine down with harsh barbs, the more he increases the inevitability that Catherine will someday rebel by latching onto the first glib male golddigger, thereby proving himself right all along.  Sloper's problem is that his paternal tunnel vision does not allow the possibility that Catherine might be more than a one-dimensional stick figure forever doomed to spinsterhood.  For Catherine, life is a gilded cage, plenty of the physical necessities, but not a whit of the emotional ones.  The more she is starved for affection, the more she will reach out even to those men like Morris who are likely mercenary.  One of the film's bitter ironies is that her father's oft repeated warnings about Morris's motivations might yet be valid.  When Morris promises to elope with her, then abruptly changes his mind after finding out that Catherine will be disinherited, his disappearance results in one of filmdom's most tragic of underplayed scenes--that of her waiting forelornly for a doorknock that does not come.  For Morris, his motivation as a gigolo is not crystal clear.  He may very well be as mercenary as Doctor Sloper accuses, or he may humanely have concluded that it is better to dump Catherine at the mock alter of the Sloper door than to risk leaving her destitute.THE HEIRESS is a movie of several memorable scenes, nearly all of which take place within the Sloper living room.  When Morris fails to appear, Catherine expects a modicum of understanding from her father.  Instead he delivers yet his most vicious of cutting remarks.  Catherine replies that she would have married him anyway, knowing that he did not love her, if only he would have offered the illusion of warmth and human contact.  The closing scene in which Catherine orders her maid 'Bolt the door, Maria,' shows that the passing of time has done more to harden her heart against a man who just may be as greedy as charged--or perhaps his earlier explanation that he wished not to impoverish her may be true.  We never know his motivation, but THE HEIRESS makes clear hers.  When she defends her decision to seek revenge against Morris, Catherine replies coldly, that of cruelty, 'I have been taught by masters.'  The bolting of the door is the symbolic equivalent of the closing of her heart.  It is no surprise that Morris's loud pounding on the Sloper door does not resonate with a heart that has learned only too well the lessons taught by Doctor Sloper.",5,"'Bolt the Door, Maria!'",1045958400,"02 23, 2003",2003,3412,"['HEIRESS', 'surprisingly', 'complex', 'drama', 'paternal', 'brutality', 'starry-eyed', 'love', 'bitter', 'revenge', 'Director', 'William', 'Wyler', 'adapted', 'Henry', 'James', 'short', 'novel', 'WASHINGTON', 'SQUARE', 'film', 'nearly', 'two', 'hours', 'managed', 'convey', 'collision', 'conflicting', 'dreams', 'three', 'major', 'characters', 'Ralph', 'Richardson', 'Doctor', 'Sloper', 'Olivia', 'de', 'Havilland', 'dowdy', 'daughter', 'Catherine', 'Sloper', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'mercenary', 'Morris', 'Townsend', 'dance', 'three-partnered', 'minuet', 'emotional', 'ties', 'clasp', 'unclasp', 'ways', 'are', 'suggested', 'more', 'gentle', 'innuendo', 'overt', 'deed', 'Doctor', 'Sloper', 'uncaring', 'brute', 'who', 'rules', 'house', 'vicious', 'wit', 'threat', 'withheld', 'inheritance', 'are', 'two', 'kinds', 'men', 'who', 'have', 'already', 'made', 'mark', 'world', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'Morris', 'seek', 'obtain', 'deceitfully', 'marriage', 'plain', 'rich', 'women', 'Catherine', 'more', 'Sloper', 'Catherine', 'down', 'harsh', 'barbs', 'more', 'inevitability', 'Catherine', 'will', 'someday', 'rebel', 'latching', 'first', 'glib', 'male', 'golddigger', 'thereby', 'proving', 'right', 'along', 'Sloper', 'problem', 'paternal', 'tunnel', 'vision', 'not', 'allow', 'possibility', 'Catherine', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'one-dimensional', 'stick', 'figure', 'forever', 'doomed', 'spinsterhood', 'Catherine', 'life', 'gilded', 'cage', 'plenty', 'physical', 'necessities', 'not', 'whit', 'emotional', 'ones', 'more', 'starved', 'affection', 'more', 'will', 'reach', 'out', 'even', 'men', 'Morris', 'who', 'are', 'likely', 'mercenary', 'One', 'film', 'bitter', 'ironies', 'father', 'oft', 'repeated', 'warnings', 'Morris', 'motivations', 'might', 'yet', 'be', 'valid', 'When', 'Morris', 'elope', 'then', 'abruptly', 'mind', 'finding', 'out', 'Catherine', 'will', 'be', 'disinherited', 'disappearance', 'results', 'one', 'filmdom', 'most', 'tragic', 'underplayed', 'scenes', 'waiting', 'forelornly', 'doorknock', 'not', 'come', 'Morris', 'motivation', 'gigolo', 'not', 'crystal', 'clear', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'as', 'mercenary', 'Doctor', 'Sloper', 'may', 'humanely', 'have', 'concluded', 'better', 'dump', 'Catherine', 'mock', 'alter', 'Sloper', 'door', 'risk', 'leaving', 'destitute.THE', 'HEIRESS', 'movie', 'several', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'nearly', 'take', 'place', 'Sloper', 'living', 'room', 'When', 'Morris', 'appear', 'Catherine', 'modicum', 'understanding', 'father', 'Instead', 'yet', 'most', 'vicious', 'cutting', 'remarks', 'Catherine', 'would', 'have', 'married', 'anyway', 'knowing', 'did', 'not', 'love', 'only', 'would', 'have', 'offered', 'illusion', 'warmth', 'human', 'contact', 'closing', 'scene', 'Catherine', 'orders', 'maid', 'door', 'Maria', 'passing', 'time', 'done', 'more', 'harden', 'heart', 'man', 'who', 'just', 'may', 'be', 'as', 'greedy', 'charged', 'perhaps', 'earlier', 'explanation', 'wished', 'not', 'impoverish', 'may', 'be', 'true', 'never', 'know', 'motivation', 'THE', 'HEIRESS', 'clear', 'hers', 'When', 'decision', 'seek', 'revenge', 'Morris', 'Catherine', 'coldly', 'cruelty', 'have', 'been', 'taught', 'masters', 'bolting', 'door', 'symbolic', 'equivalent', 'closing', 'heart', 'surprise', 'Morris', 'loud', 'pounding', 'Sloper', 'door', 'not', 'resonate', 'heart', 'learned', 'only', 'too', 'well', 'lessons', 'taught', 'Doctor', 'Sloper']",N/A

204313,A2R6RA8FRBS608,6300183912,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[17, 17]","The Heiress deals with numerous topics that many people experience and can therefore understand. We see Catherine's pain of being socially awkward and vulnerable to a young man's advances that might not be so honorable; the verbal abuse of an adult child who failed to live up to a strict parent's expectations; revenge and degrees of cold heartedness that would be too cold even for the hardest of hearts!Catherine Sloper is a spinster who lives with her wealthy father in New York's Washington Square during the 1840s. Catherine can at best be described as rather plain and unimaginative; her sole interest is doing needlepoint in the family parlor. Catherine must bear a heavy burden: her father, played brilliantly by Ralph Richardson, treats Catherine rather cruelly and he never offers Catherine the natural warmth of fatherly love for a daughter.Enter Morris Townsend who is played by a rather young Montgomery Clift. Morris makes advances toward Catherine and they all too quickly plan to marry. Their wedding engagement does not sit well with Catherine's father, Dr. Sloper. Dr. Sloper remains convinced that his daughter is being taken in by a ""fortune hunter"" and makes threats to disinherit Catherine if she marries Morris. Catherine and Morris plan to elope--but from this point on events and other things that were previously unexpected begin to happen with more and more regularity.Olivia de Havilland deserved her Oscar for her skillful portrayal of Catherine. Olivia can take Catherine in any direction she wishes. Olivia initially plays Catherine as the shy, good hearted and gushing spinster taken by the handsome Morris Townsend. However, Olivia can also play Catherine in such an entirely different voice and demeanor that one truly begins to wonder if Catherine has become possessed. Olivia makes Catherine transform very convincingly on the screen; this is one performance you're not going to forget. In addition, Ralph Richardson plays the aloof, verbally abusive but yet protective father, Dr. Sloper. Sloper berates Catherine at every turn by either comparing her to her mother or telling Catherine she is a worthless human being. Moreover, Montgomery Clift turns in a fine performance as Morris Townsend, the good looking young man who chases after Catherine. It is true that we will never know for sure that Morris wants Catherine for her money alone. However, the scene in the parlor in which Morris drinks the father's brandy and then smokes the father's cigars leads me to conclude that he was most likely a gold digger.The movie was shot in black and white and this somehow enhances the beauty and wonder of the acting. The choreography shines through particularly well in the dance scenes near the beginning of the movie; and the cinematography leaves little to be desired.The Heiress will remain an excellent example of a true movie classic for quite some while to come. The movie holds your attention very well and the pace of the plot development moves at just the right speed.I recommend this film for movie buffs and people who want to pursue the formal study of the development of American film as art. Fans of great actors like Montgomery Clift and Olivia de Havilland will not be disappointed with this movie. William Wyler did an excellent job of directing this motion picture. The DVD extras may be slim--but the movie represents a gem of a masterpiece. Great job, everyone!",5,She Was Taught To Love And Hate . . .

204314,A1TT5T47AVDDBM,6300183912,Mcgivern Owen L,"[4, 5]","""The Heiress"" is an excellent period piece as viewers are transported back to the 1890s.  While most of the action is limited to an elegant town house, the sense of era is unmistakable. Olivia de Havilland carries the picture.  She is a young, far from unattractive, sheltered woman-far too young to play the spinster.  Viewers quickly realize that she is a blatant victim of what we would now call verbal abuse. Her role will resonate with anyone who has suffered even the mildest parental oppression!  Sir Ralph Richardson is cast as the wealthy, overbearing, harshly critical father. He is uniformly excellent is his cruel and stiff-necked role. Nothing the hectored daughter can do will possibly please him. The pot boils when an unattached man takes an interest in her. Montgomery Clift is the young suitor and the central conflict quickly builds: Is he the biggest gold digger in New York City? (Richardson's view).  Or is he a nice, attractive eligible male, perfect husband material?  (de Havilland's view). Does he just want her money? Is she so love starved that she can't see straight? Richardson puts his foot down and threatens to disinherit his daughter if she marries Clift. Monty gets the word and splits, leaving Olivia alone and lonely. Did he leave because he only wanted her fortune? Or, as this reviewer believes, did he leave because he didn't want to COST the girl her fortune? The pot boils over when Monty returns and proposes! Does the leading lady fall into his arms? Or, does she turn the gold digging rat of a man away? This review won't reveal what happens! The ending is, to its' credit, definite and firm! Amazoners will just have to watch ""The Heiress"" for themselves but viewers will not be disappointed. This movie is actually quite suspenseful, almost noirish with the black and white background framing of those dank and dreary townhouse rooms. Though a flop at the box office, ""The Heiress"" did well at Oscar time:  It was nominated for Best Picture, Best Director (William Wyler), Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor (Richardson), Best Set Direction and of all things, Best Musical Score.  It won the Oscar for Score, Set- and Best Actress. That was a foregone conclusion since de Havilland had already swept The New York Film Critics and The Golden Globes. Someone must have liked those gloomy rooms and the non-essential music! Richardson could not compete with Dean Jagger, for his role in a great movie, ""Twelve O' Clock High"". Other statuettes went to ""All the King's Men"" for Best Picture and to Joseph L. Mankiewicz for Best Director (""A Letter to Three Wives""). Credit Tom O'Neil's ""Movie Awards"" for the historical tidbits. Critics may carp that this movie's transition from stage to screen was uneven. ""The Heiress"" is indeed part play-similar to many other releases. The flaw is far from fatal. This is a highly recommended movie with a good no nonsense ending. This reviewer sides with Monty: It says here that he loved her!

Shethen uses their own abusive tactics against themand when the dust clears, she stands as the solidwinner. In the end, Katharine is content with knowingthat while she has lost a lot on the surface(a father's love, a fiance, etc) she really haslost nothing at all.The great scripting of Henry James' novel (Washington Square)contains a subliminal allure that will keep theviewer interested in a seemingly basic story.This movie is an intelligently entertaining classic.",4,The Heiress,1176076800,"04 9, 2007",2007,1105,"['movie', 'definitely', 'thecritical', 'acclaim', 'received', 'awonderful', 'period', 'masterpiece', 'aged', 'well.Olivia', 'de', 'Havilland', 'was', 'rightfully', 'awarded', 'anOscar', 'textbook', 'perfect', 'performance', 'ofan', 'emotionally', 'mistreated', 'heiress', '18thcentury', 'New', 'York.The', 'script', 'art', 'direction', 'raisethe', 'credibility', 'level', 'drama.Although', 'Katharine', 'de', 'Havilland', 'not', 'whatwe', 'would', 'consider', 'ugly', 'duckling', 'austereperformance', 'viewer', 'believing', 'whatis', 'presented', 'gradually', 'bestdefense', 'overcoming', 'lifetime', 'mental', 'abuseis', 'take', 'character', 'abusers', 'Shethen', 'own', 'abusive', 'tactics', 'themand', 'when', 'dust', 'clears', 'solidwinner', 'end', 'Katharine', 'content', 'knowingthat', 'lost', 'lot', 'surface', 'father', 'love', 'fiance', 'etc', 'really', 'haslost', 'nothing', 'all.The', 'great', 'scripting', 'Henry', 'James', 'novel', 'Washington', 'Square', 'subliminal', 'allure', 'will', 'keep', 'theviewer', 'interested', 'seemingly', 'basic', 'story.This', 'movie', 'intelligently', 'entertaining', 'classic']",N/A
204317,AQ81HZS5XRNPL,6300183912,"MrsJenBardall ""Jen""","[10, 10]","In the film's opening we meet clever, sweet and slightly plain Catherine.  She is a lovely and touching individual but is relentlessly put down by her father, who never ceases to compare her to her dead mother, a woman he has idealized to such extremes that it is impossible for his daughter to measure up.  As a result he is devoid of affection, of true caring, of genuine love for her.  This is illustrated at the party in the film's early scenes, when we see a contrast between their relationship and that of Catherine's uncle and cousin, which is much more tender.At the party Catherine meets Morris, who we learn is not much more than a cad who wants Catherine's money (or does he? There is a small degree of ambiguity).  A week later the two are engaged, to the extreme displeasure of Catherine's father, who sees Morris for what he probably is.  He denies them their marriage and wisks Catherine away to Europe.  Is this because he truly loves her? Or because he is more concerned with making sure that this young man does not have any control over his money after he is gone? Probably the latter, as he then threatens to disown her should she carry out her marriage plans.  Of course, once the naive Catherine tells Morris of this, his affections cool somewhat.  He protests, desperately, that maybe her father will not disown her, that he might come around.  But Catherine has changed.  Her father has revealed to her that he does not really even like her, much less love her.  So she responds to Morris with ""Even if he does, I never will"".  She has begun to harden into the woman we see at the end of the film.Morris never does come for her that night, or any night until years later, after Catherine's father has passed away without one more word from his daughter.  She is now the heiress of a large, large fortune and as a result of her experience with two cruel men in her life has changed, hardened.  One night, Morris returns to try to woo her once again.  This time, however, Catherine is in charge of the situation.  She leads Morris to believe that she will marry him and even gives him the ruby buttons she purchased for him in Paris years earlier.  But when he comes back that night, he is greeted by a bolted door.  We are left with the sound of his pounding and calling her name, as she ascends the stairs to her bedroom, finally vindicated.What a sad, moving story this is.  We see this extraordinary character arc, played so movingly by Olivia de Havilland.  Catherine goes from a naive, ungraceful yet honest and sweet girl to a no-nonsense spinster.  Perhaps the most chilling line is delivered once she has her maid bolt the door.  She says ""Yes, I can be very cruel.  I've been taught by masters"".  Her metamorphosis is complete at this moment.There are, however, moments of great beauty in this film, all the more heartbreaking and poignant once we know the true feelings behind them.  The romantic encounters between Catherine and Morris, before his desertion, are tender and lovely.  We see the uncertain joy on Catherine's face and hope for her sake that everyone is wrong about her intended.  And in their final moments together as lovers we see the true conflict in Morris's features as he tries to convince Catharine that all is not over between her and her father.The film raises various issues about the roles of women in the mid-19th century.  It is fairly common knowledge that Morris is after Catherine's money, yet Catherine's aunt is still whole-heartedly in support of the union.  She knows that without a husband her neice is valued at nothing.  And when the aunt discovers that her neice was truthful about the split with her father, she says ""Oh Catherine, if only you could have been a bit more clever"".  In other words, she should have kept quiet on the matter until after the nuptials.  Her aunt is telling Catherine that she should have tricked Morris into marrying her, that she should have been clever enough to keep the truth from him until it was too late, that love was never a question but that marriage was the ultimate objective.  I'm not sure how I feel about this exactly, only that these messages add another layer to the tragic story, a layer which tells us that Catherine was doomed from the start.This movie is exquisite.  The performances are top-notch all the way across the board.  I love it and recommend it highly to any loved of classic cinema, and especially to anyone who loves Olivia de Havilland.

Doyle ""film buff""","[2, 2]","OLIVIA DE HAVILLAND won her well deserved second Oscar for her penetrating portrayal of the plain and wealthy heroine who is wooed by a handsome fortune hunter (MONTGOMERY CLIFT). Everything about the film clicks into place neatly--especially the performances by de Havilland, Clift, Miriam Hopkins and especially RALPH RICHARDSON as the overbearing father who cannot believe anyone would want to marry his worthless daughter.Richardson's cruelty and Clift's desertion leave de Havilland bitter in her experience with men--but her transformation into a wiser woman is well depicted and leads to a memorable ending.De Havilland plays both sides of her character with unusual skill, a nuanced and very textured performance with several layers of character evident so that she really embodies the role of the unfortunate young woman. Clift is almost too glib and modern in his role but nevertheless remains an ambiguous figure (as Wyler intended) and there is more than one facet to his character too.MIRIAM HOPKINS excels as the compassionate aunt who has romantic fancies of her own and only wants happiness for Catherine (Olivia), even if it means accepting the suitor who seems to have only one thing on his mind--Catherine's wealth. RALPH RICHARDSON gives a towering performance as the father unable to give his daughter the emotional support she needs.So many memorable scenes, it's a classic that deserves to be watched more than once to fully appreciate the treasure that it is.

Reviews don't come much better than his.He pretty much has said it all, but I'll add a few impressions of my own.The heroine, Catherine Sloper, the plain daughter of an insensitive, egotistical father who humiliates her, is played so well by Olivia de Havilland that you forget that Olivia is a very beautiful woman indeed as she morphs into the socially gauche, plain Catherine. The opening scenes in which she attends a dance and sits on the sideline, a wallflower, agitatedly fanning herself, actually made me sweat.When the gold-digger Morris Townsend asks her to dance, she does not know the steps. But as she is twirled around a bit you see her unwind and begin to enjoy herself in the arms of the shallow Mr. Townsend.She reveals a hidden grace.Olivia has Catherine unfold rather like a flower and as such she almost becomes pretty- almost because Olivia will not let you suddenly see Catherine as pretty.You will see a big change in her but it is all psychological.William Wyler, who directed the film, agitated many film actors by requiring multiple takes for virtually every scene-he almost drove Laurence Olivier nuts in the filming of ""Wuthering Heights"" a decade earlier. You wonder whether Mr. Wyler demanded many re-takes of Olivia's every gesture, but whatever he did he drew forth a wonderful performance.Montgomery Clift's portrayal of Morris Townsend is called light -weight by some critics, but the character IS light-weight. A superficial phony unused to deep thoughts, Morris in the long run is no match for Catherine's developing strength of chsracter, her courage and her rage when he deserts her. Although transparent in his scheme to grab a fortune as Catherine's husband you cannot blame the socially inexperienced Catherine for falling for him when no other man had ever looked at her twice.Morris and Dr. Sloper will get their comeuppance at Catherine's hand and you cheer for her. When Morris is outside in the dark futily banging on the door you see Catherine slowly walking up stairs a look of triumph and a small smile on her lips. Somehow you know Catherine is not only going to weather this she may even find happiness.The little triumphant smile tells you that.Miriam Hopkins as Catherine's ebullient aunt adds balance to the film so that not everything is bete noir.

The film was nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor (Richardson) and Best B & W Cinematography. Olivia DeHaviland won that Oscar for Best Actress. She deserves all of the accolades as do all of the actors in this movie. What hasn't been said about this movie that has not been said before? What is it that makes us return to this film again and again? We have seen what has been played before our eyes but we are left to analyze the movie on our own. Catherine, poor Catherine, always compared to her dead mother, never loved by her father. Did Catherine become a wiser, better person, or did she simply become as hard and bitter as her father?  Did she ever go on to meet someone else, perhaps someone who really loved her, or was she so deeply wounded and suspicious that she could never trust a man again?  Catherine has never received either tenderness or attention. Her father injures her daily by his cruel remarks about her imperfections - looks, manners, and intelligence. Ask people their thoughts and you will receive as many different variations.""An actress who plays Catherine Sloper has to be able to move quickly and credibly from self-possession to timidity; she also has to register several different kinds of humiliation in succession, and then a hardening and deviousness. It's a wonderful role for a first-rate actress. DeHavilland exceeded all expectations. Her physician father played by Sir Ralph Richardson was superb. He was cool and mean and rarely showed emotion.

204331,A4FX5YCJA630V,6300183912,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[3, 4]","Unlike many others, I first experienced this story through reading the original novellaWashington Squareby Henry James, and it was a long time before I realized that ""The Heiress"" was an adaptation of the book, or even that his book had been adapted at all. First published in 1880, ""Washington Square"" was adapted by writers Ruth and Augustus Goetz into a stage play called ""The Heiress"" in 1947, which in turn was the basis for the film of the same name. Directed by William Wyler, with starring performances by Olivia de Havilland, Montgomery Clift and Ralph Richardson, the film won high accolades and earned de Havilland her second Academy Award for Best Actress.Set in New York near the turn of the century (amusingly, the film begins with a rather dated subtitle reading: ""one hundred years ago"") we are introduced to the household of Doctor Sloper. An affluent and luxurious home, the widowed doctor lives there with his only daughter Catherine, a rather plain and cripplingly shy girl who is set to inherit a fortune on the event of her father's death. She lives solely to please her father, a man who refuses to be pleased; haunted as he is by the memory of Catherine's beautiful, graceful mother. There is a small photograph of this woman which is often picked up and admired by various characters, and though the audience never gets to see her, it's clear that Catherine has no hope of living up to her ghost.Her constant companion is her romantic and flighty Aunt Penniman, whom her father hopes will bring Catherine out of her shell a little. Unbeknownst to him, Catherine is in fact rather witty and charming when she's at ease with her aunt, but as soon as she's forced to interact with others at any sort of social gathering, she becomes an awkward wallflower. It is at one such party that she meets the dashing Morris Townsend, who gradually charms her and helps her unwind. It would seem there's beauty in her after all as she manages a graceful dance in his arms and soon enough, he's calling for her in Washington Square.But Doctor Sloper has misgivings. Morris squandered his own inheritance, has no real prospects, and seems very likely to be a fortune hunter after Catherine's money. For her part, Catherine is too besotted to notice anything past Morris's constant assertions that he's as in love with her as she is with him. Their quick engagement infuriates Doctor Sloper and he confronts Morris with his suspicions, driving a wedge between himself and his daughter. Catherine is caught in an impossible situation: to please her overbearing father or to take a chance at happiness with a man who may not truly love her?But the characterization goes deeper than this. Doctor Sloper's suspicions aren't simply born out of his judgment of Morris's behavior, but because of his own low opinion of Catherine. In his eyes, she's so dull and plain that no man in his right mind would love her if not for her money. His interaction with Catherine is filled with subtle put-downs, and it's a heartbreaking moment when Catherine asks that he praise her just a little in front of Morris. Furthermore, it's clear enough that Doctor Sloper is not solely concerned with Catherine's wellbeing - he's just as soon protecting his own fortune as his daughter's feelings.And as for Morris - is he really out for Catherine's inheritance? He certainly takes a vested interest in the house and has a barely concealed disdain for Aunt Penniman's flightiness. But though he's rakish and charming and probably up to no good, Catherine is so starved for love and affection that even if she could see him for what he truly was, she might not care.  As her aunt points out to Doctor Sloper: even if Morris IS a gold-digger - so what? If he makes Catherine so happy, then perhaps she should be allowed to marry him regardless.Thus we have the bitter triangle. Catherine is unwilling to disobey her father, but cannot be convinced to give up the man she loves. Doctor Sloper is stubborn to a fault, and resorts to cruelty when he tells his daughter that a man like Morris could not possibly love such a dull creature as her. Morris Townsend is tested, not by Doctor Sloper, but by Catherine herself - and found wanting. Thus the film revolves around this dynamic of three distinct personalities colliding in the most devastating way possible, and its success rests upon the strength of its tiny cast and the layers of ambiguity each one brings to their characters and motivations.Some spoilers below:Ralph Richardson is Doctor Sloper; he's charming and poised, generous and solicitous toward his servants, and (in his eyes at least) endlessly patient with his daughter and sister. But he's also more cold and tyrannical than he realizes, and at times almost robotic or alien in nature, so inapproachable does he appear to his daughter. Montgomery Clift is Morris Townsend, Catherine's handsome and charming suitor who may well be out for Catherine's money, but keeps you guessing with a few moments of what seems like genuine fondness for the girl. Miriam Hopkins puts on a great show as Aunt Penniman (lending some much-needed levity to the proceedings), a woman who dearly loves her niece but often does more harm than good when it comes to her welfare.But it's Olivia de Havilland that delivers a tour-de-force performance as the lovelorn Catherine. Thanks to the combination of unflattering makeup and her own body language, the otherwise luminous Havilland transforms herself into a dowdy spinster. The sight of her sitting down at a party and nervously fanning herself is as tense as any action-sequence, and her desperate need to impress her father is palatable. Every emotion is naked on her face; every thought is clear in her eyes. We see her growing fascination with Morris, her hope and desperation and despair. When she tells him ""I love you,"" for the first time, her face is filled with wonder, as though she can't believe that such a thing could be possible. And then, by the end, we witness her stunning transformation into an independent, autocratic spinster, who when accused of ""such cruelty"" by her aunt, coldly replies: ""I have been taught by masters.""The true tragedy of the situation is that neither man recognizes Catherine's true worth: her loving heart and gentle nature, and by the time they're through with her, they've each had a hand in destroying it. When her maid Mariah gives her a genuine compliment on her appearance before asking if she might go for a walk in the park, Catherine instantly assumes that the praise was only given as a prelude to her request. Her ability to trust is gone forever, but she exacts her revenge on those who took it from her: her father with a devastating verbal dressing-down and a refusal to see him on his death bed, and Morris with a vicious ploy in which she pretends to accept him back into her heart, only to bolt the door and ignore his pleading.With a lamp in her hand she glides up the stairs, an abstruse smile on her face, leaving the audience with a wealth of questions and possibilities to consider. Has she given in to bitterness and vengeance? Or has she freed herself from the past and regained her self-respect? Was Morris being sincere in his affections, or was Catherine right in saying he had ""gotten more greedy"" by wanting her love as well as her money? Should she have accepted his second proposal and found fulfillment in marriage, or will she now go on to lead a richer, fuller life, having declared that she will never stitch another embroidery? Is this a happy ending or not? Like all the best stories, it leaves it up to you to decide.The richness of the characters, the ambiguity of their situation, the elegance with which such a complex story is told with so few actors and sets, and the unforgettable denouement is what makes ""The Heiress"" so impressive.",5,"""I Have Been Taught By Masters...""",1359417600,"01 29, 2013",2013,7848,"['many', 'others', 'first',

204332,A2P5BW17M2SBYX,6300183912,"Robert Brian Lamm ""robeezee""","[4, 5]","I've enjoyed reading the many insightful reviews offered here about The Heiress.However, one aspect that I have not seen explored here, and one that has occurred to me after more than one viewing of the film is the prospect that Catherine's father's rejection of her is fueled by his misdirected anger at her for the loss of her mother.  Apparently, her mother died in childbirth.  As Dr. Sloper points out to his sister at the party given to celebrate her daughter's engagement (referring to the dazzling creature represented by his deceased wife) ""This is what I lost....and this....(pointing to Catherine) is what I got in return.  It could be that no matter how Catherine evolved, it would never be good enough for her father because he harbors such animosity toward her for taking away his beloved wife. And since unresolved anger often begets more anger, he reaps his rewards, so to speak, in Catherine's final rejection of him.The Heiress is an extremely complex movie.  I have heard the transition made by Catherine, played by Olivia DeHavilland, described in these reviews as (1) her turning into a bitter woman, (2) a wise woman, (3) a woman more in control of her life, (4) a suspicious woman, etc.  Is she a tragic figure?  Does she triumph?  Has her experience made her wiser or has it hardened her heart forever, resulting in an inability to trust, even in everyday situations (recall the scene near the end when Maria compliments Catherine on her dress and is rebuffed for her ""false compliments"").Catherine's father, played by Sir Ralph Richardson has similarly been described as (1) a scoundrel, (2) an unloving father who robbed Catherine of any self-esteem she might have had (3) hateful and (4) a victim.Catherine's dad reminds me a great deal of my own father - wounded early in his life by a tragedy, and forever unable to demonstrate love toward another person - including his wife or children.  It took many years for me to see him as anything but a scoundrel, but now I understand that he was also a victim.  I see Catherine's father in the same way.  Unable to cope, emotionally with this child who, as a result of being born, took the life of his wife.  To him, his demonstration of any affection toward his daughter would be a betrayal of his wife.  This perverted viewpoint robbed both Catherine and her father of a relationship that could have been loving and supportive.Then, there is Morris - seemingly a mercenary opportunist, described aptly by Catherine's father as a fortune hunter...would he have abandoned Catherine once he had accesss to her money, thus breaking her heart?  Or, as Catherine argues to her father, ""Since you didn't love me, at least you could have allowed someone else to try.""  Of course, given her father's jaundiced viewpoint of her, he could not imagine that anyone worthwhile would be interested in Catherine for any other reason than her money.Obviously, as in real life situations, there is a complexity that makes all of these assertions true to some extent.

With my thirst to see her in another showstopper I came across this film that really by the end struck a cord with me.  I could absolutely relate to the Catherine character with her being shy, low-esteemed person with a very protective, yet brow beating father.  Olivia's amazing transformation and tone through the first half of the movie and by the climatic end is very rich and believable and Olivia's make-up is quite plain Jane and fitting for this role!  The overall performances of the rest of the cast are well-acted and let me say Montgomery Clift -- smoking hot, yummy!  The chemistry between Olivia and Montgomery is strong, warm, and beautiful throughout the film.

Catherine Sloper is a plain young woman in her mid - twenties who lives in a grand house with her stern unloving father and his flighty sister Lavinia. The setting is Washington Square, N.Y.C. of the 1850's. Catherine falls in love with Morris Townsend of whom her tyrannical father does not approve. Catherine waits for Morris to come and take her away and elope; prior to this she has told him that has been disinherited. When it's obvious that Townsend will not show up, Lavinia, brokenhearted for her neice says to her &quot;Oh, Catherine, why couldn't you have been just  little more clever?&quot;  De Havilland did not enjoy working with Richardson ( although she realised his greatness as an actor ) and later referred to him as &quot;a wicked, cruel and selfish man&quot;. The apex of the film occurs when Townsend again comes for Catherine ( there's MONEY this time ).

Her father, Doctor Sloper (Ralph Richardson) has a polite contempt for her. This feeds Catherine's insecurities and awkwardness, as well as an almost desperate desire to please.Then one night, at a party, she meets the handsome and dashing Morris. (Montgomery Clift) He quickly courts her, and not long after their first meeting, purposes. Catherine agrees at once, convinced of his love for her. Doctor Sloper, however, is not. He threatens to cut off his part of her inheritance if she marries Morris. (She already has a great deal of money from her mother, although only 1/3 of what she would have total if her dad disinherited her.) Upon learning this, Morris takes off, ditching poor Catherine. Between this, and a lifetime of mostly subtle verbal abuse, Catherine tells her father off, and denies him forgiveness on his deathbed.Morris comes rolling back into town some years later (we never really get a specific number on that) and tries to win Catherine back with claims of love. Unfortunately for him, Catherine is a changed woman. She's lost her shyness and clusmy ways, a poised, articulate woman now. However, she's also lost her sweetness and trust, and doesn't believe a word out of his mouth. In the end, she bolts Morris from her life, ready to move on with her life.This movie is excellent. Everyone gives a skillful performance. Oliva DeHavilland does her best work here, her transformation from a sweet, awkward girl to the hardened, self-controlled heiress was nothing sort of magnificant. Montgomery Clift cleverly keeps you guessing, and until he tips his hand, you're not quite sure if he truly loves Catherine, or if he's just thinking of his wallet. Ralph Richardson commands the screen as the cruelly witty father who by expecting too much out of people, especially his daughter, dies alone and unloved.This isn't a story about revenge, or about the pitfalls of love. It's ultimately about taking control of your own life, and having to trade innocence for wisdom.

204344,A2IG2FG7L85RMU,6300183912,Stanley H. Nemeth,"[5, 6]","This film in its acting, direction, photography, and musical score is sheer perfection.  The elegant haughtiness and razor-sharp wit of Ralph Richardson as Dr. Sloper enrich a characterization as polished as any of those that great actor ever gave.  Olivia de Havilland for her part traces a grand arc, from the timid, cowering girl whose occasional sparks of wit and independence barely peep out to the ramrod-postured, acid-tongued, triumphantly self-possessed daughter ""who has found her tongue at last."" William Wyler's direction here turns every frame into a work of visual art. The opening out of James' tale to include a brilliantly witty, extended party sequence is a high point in screen adaptation. The glorious camera work in such scenes as those where the heroine and her aunt, sitting like figures in Greek tragedy, wait for Morris' arrival, the closing of parlor doors in the audience's face to terminate our presence at moments of intense private grief, and the images of the dreary flights of stairs the heroine must labor up in her misfortune,  to have her on a level with their landings onlyin the concluding shots - these linger in the memory as moments of classic cinema. Similarly, Aaron Copeland's score creates through authentic songs and dances the appropriate 19th Century background while underlining with original composition the moments of high romantic passion and rage.The weaknesses of the film, in my view, stem directly from the stage adaptation of the James novella which in several places vulgarizes the story unduly.  The film unfortunately reproduces these changes.  Namely, we see a bitter Catherine who refuses to attend her father in his dying moments, a character far less stirring than the story's still dutiful, nursing daughter who nonetheless now makes clear to her too controlling father where his influence ends and her area of personhood begins. More important is the changed ending. Not to give this away, I'll simply point out that what was in James a story of the individual's education and growth is by this alteration reduced to a mere tabloid tale of vengefulness.Nonetheless, as a film this work remains as one of the grand achievements. There was talk several years back of remaking it with Tom Cruise as Morris and having Mike Nichols as director.  These worthies viewed the Wyler film and both decided a remake was unwise as they didn't see how they could improve on it.  One wishes the director of the version that was remade had had the taste and intelligence of Cruise and Nichols.",5,"""Just About As Good As It Gets""",1020470400,"05 4, 2002",2002,2542,"['film', 'acting', 'direction', 'photography', 'musical', 'score', 'sheer', 'perfection', 'elegant', 'haughtiness', 'razor-sharp', 'wit', 'Ralph', 'Richardson', 'Dr.', 'Sloper', 'characterization', 'as', 'polished', 'great', 'actor', 'ever', 'gave', 'Olivia', 'Havilland', 'part', 'grand', 'arc', 'timid', 'cowering', 'girl', 'occasional', 'sparks', 'wit', 'independence', 'barely', 'out', 'ramrod-postured', 'acid-tongued', 'triumphantly', 'self-possessed', 'daughter', 'who', 'found', 'tongue', 'last', 'William', 'Wyler', 'direction', 'here', 'frame', 'work', 'visual', 'art', 'opening', 'James', 'tale', 'include', 'brilliantly', 'witty', 'extended', 'party', 'sequence', 'high', 'point', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'glorious', 'camera', 'work', 'such', 'scenes', 'where', 'heroine', 'aunt', 'sitting', 'figures', 'Greek', 'tragedy', 'wait', 'Morris', 'arrival', 'closing', 'parlor', 'doors', 'audience', 'face', 'terminate', 'presence', 'moments', 'intense', 'private', 'grief', 'images', 'dreary', 'flights', 'stairs', 'heroine', 'must', 'labor', 'up', 'misfortune', 'have', 'level', 'landings', 'concluding', 'shots', 'linger', 'memory', 'moments', 'classic', 'cinema', 'Similarly', 'Aaron', 'Copeland', 'score', 'authentic', 'songs', 'appropriate', '19th', 'Century', 'background', 'underlining', 'original', 'composition', 'moments', 'high', 'romantic', 'passion', 'rage.The', 'weaknesses', 'film', 'view', 'stem', 'directly', 'stage', 'adaptation', 'James', 'novella', 'several', 'places', 'vulgarizes', 'story', 'unduly', 'film', 'unfortunately', 'changes', 'Namely', 'see', 'bitter', 'Catherine', 'who', 'attend', 'father', 'dying', 'moments', 'character', 'far', 'less', 'stirring', 'story', 'still', 'dutiful', 'nursing', 'daughter', 'who', 'nonetheless', 'now', 'clear', 'too', 'controlling', 'father', 'where', 'influence', 'ends', 'area', 'personhood', 'begins', 'More', 'important', 'changed', 'ending', 'Not', 'give', 'away', ""'ll"", 'simply', 'point', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'James', 'story', 'individual', 'education', 'growth', 'alteration', 'reduced', 'mere', 'tabloid', 'tale', 'vengefulness.Nonetheless', 'film', 'work', 'one', 'grand', 'achievements', 'was', 'talk', 'several', 'years', 'back', 'remaking', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Morris', 'having', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'director', 'worthies', 'viewed', 'Wyler', 'film', 'decided', 'remake', 'was', 'unwise', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'could', 'improve', 'One', 'director', 'version', 'was', 'remade', 'had', 'had', 'taste', 'intelligence', 'Cruise', 'Nichols']",N/A

I could see on my big screen TV the wrinkles around her eyes and it was like, How old she anyway?! This was a casting issue--no disrespect to the actress intended. I thought she did okay, but certainly not at an Oscar level; I wouldn't have given her an Oscar. (I was actually more impressed with the other players who were exceptional!)Back in the 20s/30s/40s they sure had their fair share of gold digger movies. The difference here is the man is the gold digger. He stands to share or get $10,000/year from the mother-in-law's estate and $30,000/year from the father-in-law's estate. She is already dead; he is at death's door. All he has to do is work his way into the woman's heart and then her wallet.Catherine Sloper (OdH) is your atypical heiress. Not the gorgeous gussied-up heiresses of today; no, she's plain Jane--as plain as they come. She has, indeed, in the opinion of her frustrated father (Ralph Richardson), who tried to make her an eligible bachelorette, nothing to offer a husband. No looks, no personality, no conversation skills, zip. Her only skill is neat embroidery.Naturally she's never been kissed and never been loved. Such a woman, of course, no matter her age, is exceedingly vulnerable to the advances of a dashing suitor. Enter Morris Townsend (Montgomery Clift) who plays the charming gentleman perfectly. They meet on the dance floor and he moves to sweep her off her feet. The man with no assets, no job, and no prospects.I enjoyed the elegant and polite conversations everyone had early on in this movie. It was like a finely played orchestra of speech!Although the film had my attention throughout I felt it was somewhat predictable. You've seen this before. Unloved woman meets handsome man. She falls in love. He proposes. She accepts. Father doesn't approve. Tension fills the air. What will happen? Will they change their minds? Elope? What?How about some of the most vicious dialogue you'll ever hear between father and daughter from a film of the 1940s? This stuff was epic. Just so nasty, your jaw will literally hit the floor...Catherine is sitting on a bench outside her father's home. The maid comes outside to say she is being summoned by her father because he's about to die. She refuses to leave the bench...The script is very polished as you would expect after the adaptation of a popular play that was based on a novel. If you like great old-fashioned dialogue that is elegant and acerbic, with lots of zingers, you should enjoy this one. Also recommended for rich single men and women.The moral of the story: If you don't have much to offer, stay out of the dating world. You'll save yourself a ton of heartache.Bonus: Fathers, be very careful how you deal with your daughters and speak to them about men they like.

204351,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,6300183912,Turfseer,"[3, 3]","*** This review contains spoilers ***Who is the main antagonist of 'The Heiress'? Is it Dr. Sloper, who continually humiliates his daughter because she can't measure up to his deceased wife but ends up leaving his fortune to her anyway? Or is it Catherine, whose self-esteem growing up, takes a beating at the hands of her father, only to transform herself later on into a calculating independent woman who coldly fails to visit her father on his deathbed and takes revenge on a conniving suitor? Or is it Morris Townsend, the ne'r-do-well who brings a little excitement into the life of the socially backward Catherine but all along is simply after her inheritance? It is precisely these ambiguities that have sparked so much discussion on the internet regarding this flawed but fascinating film classic.Many internet posters consider Dr. Sloper the true villain of the piece. But is he? By the standards of the 21st century, some view him as a classic misogynist. But in terms of when the story is supposed to take place, the 1840s, he's actually a true man of his times. When Catherine brings the fish she's bought from the fish vendor into the house, Dr. Sloper gently reminds her that she's failing to follow the typical class protocol of the time--which is to have the vendor bring the fish into the house. But does he run down the street and thrash the vendor with a cane because the man failed to assist his 'social betters'? The vendor's 'faux pas' along with Catherine's, hardly concerns the good doctor.But there are those who fault Dr. Sloper for being violent on the inside--the way in which he inflicts grave psychological harm to his daughter. He tells his sister, Mrs. Penniman, that he considers Catherine ""mediocre"" and ""lacks poise"" but on the other hand, gently reassures her to her face that ""she's not a disturbing person"". Today, young people who are developmentally disabled are not stigmatized the way they were 160 years ago. They see psychologists or go to special schools. But in 1849, there were no shades of gray when it came to mental health. Those who were considered 'slow' or 'childlike' had to 'sink or swim'. Dr. Sloper's patronizing attitude toward his daughter was a mixture of both contempt and true parental concern. In a sense, Dr. Sloper was a 19th century advocate of today's 'tough love'. He 'expected' his daughter to adjust but when he saw that she didn't have the insight to see through Morris, he didn't forbid her never to see him again--rather, he judiciously suggested a compromise where he took her to Europe, where he was hoping that she might come to her senses.After their return to New York, Dr. Sloper made some hurtful, inappropriate comments to Catherine after she informs her father that she hasn't changed her mind and still intends to marry Morris. He tells her that she has nothing to offer and men will be only be interested in her for her money. Clearly, he's frustrated with her since she can't see through Morris and leaves her with the famous line that her only real talent is her neat embroidery. Catherine's emotional transformation from naive waif to the steel-hearted heiress in a heartbeat is perhaps the least convincing scene in the movie. But hey, that's what melodrama is all about! To confess, I liked Olivia de Haviland in the second half where she's much better at playing a Cruella de Ville than a Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.As for Catherine, it's clear she's depicted as a tragic figure, incorporating all of her father's bad points and becoming even more inflexible than he. When Dr. Sloper is dying, he's even willing to praise her gumption in deciding not to go with Morris. But as he reaches out, Catherine falsely tells her father that she's still in love with Morris, just to get back at him even more. The coup de grace is when she fails to visit her father on his deathbed. I would say a majority of people when they get older, forgive their parents and acknowledge that they tried their best. But not so with the embittered Catherine.Finally there's Morris Townsend whose character was modified to be more benign from the original source material of the play the movie was based on. This was done at the behest of the film's producers, who felt that the public would not accept a romantic leading man such as Montgomery Clift, as a malevolent villain. Morris is the weakest of the three principals, precisely because we find out so little about him. He's a charmer and has a nefarious plan and that's it. And while he deserves his comeuppance when Catherine locks him out of the house, I found the way in which she takes revenge to be rather a dull and unoriginal plan. There needed to be something a little more dramatic and clever for the finale, instead of Montgomery Clift locked out of the house and simply banging incessantly on the door.I would be remiss if I also failed to mention the comic relief of the story--and that's Aunt Lavinia Penniman. She's also an ambiguous character in that she's quite supportive of Catherine but undermines her at the same time due to her support of Townsend. Penniman's problem is she's addicted to romance novels. So it doesn't matter whether Townsend is a scoundrel or not; her need is to live vicariously and have her 'fix' of romance--blinding her to the reality of Townsend's scheme which ultimately contributes to Catherine's heartache, by egging her on into the lion's den.Has Catherine actually turned a new page in her life after taking revenge on Morris? Like so many other scenes in this film, it's ambiguous. But it's really the dynamic father-daughter relationship which makes the film so compelling and has led to so much stimulating discussion about it on the internet.",4,Conflicted father figure steals
