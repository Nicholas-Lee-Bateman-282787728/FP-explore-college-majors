Both of these movies are favorites of mine and have a common theme.  John Wayne is the the leader trying to develop the men of his command.  Flying Tigers is the hotshot fighter pilot movie.  Can John Wayne tame a hotshot pilot who is out for his own glory?  John Carroll is great as the flamboyant hot shot who learns his lesson the hard way, at the cost of another's life.  Sands of Iwo Jima is a classic that way an Oscar nomination for Wayne.  Can he reach the son of an officer and friend?  Can he find a way to make John Agar grow up?

Stryker, a tough, mean instructor who takes a collection of recruits and is ordered to make them combat ready. Among the trainees is John Agar who plays the son of Wayne's former dead commander. Wayne's idea of the commander was that he was the greatest Marine to ever exist and the son a sorry excuse for a Marine. In between their days of training the movie focuses on the soldiers as they drink, fall in love, and fight. They take part in the battles of Tarawa which has excellent scenes of combat with some being real and includes the only piece of actual combat film of Japanese soldiers in combat against Marines. Finally Agar and Wayne come to an understanding and Agar finds he is more like his father than he thought.Flying Tigers is strictly make believe, but based on the famous Flying Tiger squadron of American mercenary pilots fighting for China before the U.S. entry into the war. Wayne plays the commander of this collection of patriots, get rich quick, egomanaics, and flers for the honor of flying pilots. At the same time he is having a relationship with a nurse.
