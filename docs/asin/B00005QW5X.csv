675904,AIR4YWDDONXUX,B00005QW5X,Adam M. Miles,"[0, 1]","'Hedwig and the Angry Inch' is quite simply a work of genius.  The music is tremendous--unlike most musicals, where the songs take the viewer outside of the story, these intensely personal songs carry the story beyond literal narrative to music, the songs on Hedwig carry great symbolism and reveal the psyche of the protagonist on a truly meaningful level.  The performances in the film are wonderful, with John Cameron Mitchell's title role worthy of Academy Award mention. Mitchell's direction also merits recognition, with a perfect balance of vivid realism and a stylistic flair of fantasy.  'Hedwig' had me leaving the theatre more jazzed and full of energy than any film I can remember.

E Rothert,"[13, 14]","This is a DVD to own, not to rent.I was more than a little irked when professional reviewers and friends alike repeatedly told me last summer than Hedwig was &quot;better than Moulin Rouge.&quot;  I enjoyed Moulin Rouge very much, thank you, and I was not interested in some artsy take on a similar theme.  Alas, despite my best efforts, Hedwig won me over.  If only I could get the appropriate hat-thingie, I would be a yet-another Hed-head.Hedwig is good for all the reasons Moulin Rouge was good: it is a fun, campy, musical pleasurefest for the eyes and ears.  But Moulin Rouge was a story created around songs, while Hedwig's songs come from her story-- and we really believe her heart.I thought I understood Hedwig when I saw it in the theater the first time.  When I went back, I caught many thoughts that I missed.  Now-- after an embarassingly large number of views on DVD-- I look back in wonder at how I missed so much.  Hedwig is bitter-- and has more reason to be than any of the bitter people I have ever come across (or have come across me).  Life has dealt her some severe blows, but her wit and her music keep her afloat... barely.  It takes Hedwig many years to realizes that despite all the changes she has been through, it is still her blind, unquestioned belief that she lacks what it takes to be whole-- a myth many believe in-- that drags her down.Hedwig is a story of transformation.  Once a viewer gets over the male-female dichonomy she personifies, we see that the change she made physically from man to not-a-woman-or-a-man does not cut as deeply as the emotional changes from being betrayed by her father, mother, and lovers.John Cameron Mitchell is completely believable as Hedwig.  Oddly, Miriam Shor's performance as Yitzak is so well executed it gives me the creeps.  But it is Michael Pitt's Tommy Gnosis that looks most at home on the screen.  I expect that Hedwig and &quot;Bully&quot; will be early mentions in a long career for this guy.This film is richer with multiple viewings, so let me put on some advertising spin: Hedwig is the movie that keeps on giving.  It fills you up and never lets you down.  It is the taste of a New Generation.Watch it.

But in NYCsummer of '98, I was fortunate enough to catch John CameronMitchell and the original cast at the funky theatre where thisplay, or rather event, started.  I can't say that I really likedthe experience that much, as the music was way too loud, but thestory is great and it was enjoyable just to watch the crowd,many of them bewildered tourists just following the Times receommendations, take in this highly unusual production.The movie is terrific.For outlandishness, this film makes ""Rocky Horror"" look like""To Sir with Love"".  And while I am not a rock music fan, I wasyears ago, and found this music wonderful and poignant.  And the whole thing has just the right touch of humor and over-the-top campiness.  There are scenes in this movie that one can watch like music videos and laugh hysterically, dance, or sing along.Mitchell and his collaborator Stephen Trask should have won a bunch of Oscars for this--best picture, best music, best song,(except there are so many good ones, it's hard to figure out which one's best) and best director.  The extras on this DVD are fascinating and moving. especially since Mitchell is the son ofa military big shot and his family is warmly accepting of his unconventionality.  The story of  how this amazing productiongot started is unbelievable.  I certainly hope that Mitchell and his friends don't stop here, but go on to do more in music and theatre.

675908,AIA037CW1Y5WT,B00005QW5X,Amazon Customer,"[4, 7]","Not since Tommy (1975) have I seen such the rock and roll (or perhaps Punk and Roll) drama.  John Cameron Mitchell plays Hedwig (Head-vig) who lives in East Berlin before the wall fell.  In order to get out of Berlin he is talked into a gender changing operation so that he can marry a military man and move to the US.  Needless to say the operation goes awry and the Berlin wall falls shortly after he leaves.  As if it could get no worse the music that he writes and performs is stolen by his protege Tommy Gnosis who becomes rich and famous.  Hedwig and his band (The Angry Inch -- see operation) shadow Gnosis at all his gigs trying to get back the recognition they deserve.  The comedic moments are filled with slight bitter afterbite as Hedwig searches desperately for his other half.  He finds that when he strips everything down to the very core that he has truly found his other half and no amount of lovers, fame, fortune, and Farrah Fawcett wings will make any difference.  The music was excellent so if you don't catch the movie you should find the web site and grab the MP3's.  The best song &quot;Origin of Love&quot; is sadly not there.  I rented this movie on VHS but I'd recommend it in letterbox on DVD.

No, its not a great movie, but it has just the right amount of weirdness, pomp and some pretty good rock music to become one of the first major cult sucesses of the 21st century. It centers around a German transexual who after a sex change op gone wrong leaves him with the ""angry inch"" of the title, is appalled when his secret gay lover steals credit for his music and becomes a number one chart success and sets out to get his music back. The music is pretty good, but the movie itself isn't completely sucessful. That said it works better as a film because the visual elements including animation add to what is a rather bizarre, unique viewing experience. Naturally, I haven't seen the musical on which it is based (typical of me, I know) but I recommend it if you are in the mood to watch something a little different, though personally I think ROCKY HORROR stands head and shoulders over HEDWIG any day.",3,Not bad.

675910,A3MPEDYM4DGS5O,B00005QW5X,BigSPEEGS,"[8, 10]","Think about what rock musicals have been like. It's no surprise that when most people think about the rock musical, they think about midnight showings with tons of obsessed fans screaming as the movie plays out before them, decked in attire identical to that of the characters up on screen. One thinks of cultish style, no substance. In other words, when thinking about the rock musical, one immediately thinks ""Rocky Horror"", and there's a reason for that. Finally, someone has decided to take the rock musical seriously and it works better than one could've imagined. Ladies and gentlemen, whether you like it or not... ""HEDWIG!""Based on the off-Broadway hit of the same name, Hedwig and the Angry Inch is about Hedwig Robinson (John Cameron Mitchell), and his journey to find his ""other half"". While living in East Berlin, Hedwig (then Hansel) meets Sgt. Luther Robinson (Maurice Dean Wint), who over some gummi bears decides to marry him. The only problem is, he has to marry him in Berlin, which would require a physical examination. ""To get away, you've gotta leave something behind,"" Luther tells Hansel. So it is agreed that Hansel must have a sex change operation. Unfortunately for Hansel (who changes his name to Hedwig), the doctor botched the operation, leaving him with nothing but an ""angry inch"". Luther and Hedwig run off to America, where Luther's wandering eye gets the best of him. Left alone, Hedwig just puts on some makeup, pulls the wig down from the shelf and goes back to her first love of music. That too has its problems: Hedwig gets involved in a relationship with Tommy Speck (Michael Pitt), who steals her music and becomes pop icon Tommy Gnosis. When we meet Hedwig at the beginning of the film, her and her band The Angry Inch are following Gnosis world tour in hopes of landing a successful lawsuit.""Hedwig"" rocks like no other movie I have ever seen. The soundtrack is (in my humble opinion) full of classic songs, and the film is full of audacious numbers to match them. I could easily be convinced that this film was made for upwards of $25 million. But obviously, style isn't dictated by budget (the film was made for $6 million). Just look at ""Wig in a Box,"" where a trailer wall is kicked down to become a stage. Or ""Angry Inch"", where Hedwig's bold retelling of his past lashes out and causes the whole place to erupt. The music could've easily been tacky, but no. The songs, written by Stephen Trask, are punk rock masterpieces (some highlights including ""Origin of Love"", ""Midnight Radio"" and ""Wig in a Box"") that had me singing for days after. I am now convinced that the music industry would be on its way to redemption if more people could write with the gusto and originality of Stephen Trask's work.The film's characters all have stunning emotional depth. Every character is developed, the relationships seem real, and they are all acted to perfection. That there is already more than you can say about most rock musicals. ""Hedwig"" is the brainchild of John Cameron Mitchell. He knows ""this punk rock star"" up and down and thus turns in a near flawless performance. Hedwig is bitter, stubborn and sarcastic, but never unpleasant for the audience to be with. Michael Pitt is impressive as the rip-off artist Tommy Gnosis, and Miriam Shor gives a wonderfully layered performance as Yitzak, Hedwig's husband/wife obviously unsure of her place in the world (just like Hedwig herself).""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" has done what no other rock musical has done before. It refuses to give up the music for the story, or vice versa. Instead, the songs complement Hedwig's journey in such a way that we understand her position even more after each one. Now only one question remains: is ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" the greatest rock musical ever made?

As a young man, Hansel/Hedwig lived in East Berlin, right before The Wall came tumbling down. His sexual identity was always in question and when a cute, black, American soldier gives him a way out of the Eastern Bloc, Hedwig jumps on him (literally and figuratively). But he can't get to the other side of The Wall as a man, so an operation takes place to remove his vital functions below the waist ...if you get my meaning. Needless to say (if you pay attention to the title of the film), the surgery gets botched and leaves Hedwig with his ""Angry Inch.""The anger is twofold. First is the failed operation; second is Hedwig's fury over stolen musical material by someone named Tommy Gnosis (Michael Pitt). Tommy is a rock-n-roll sensation, but it's all because of what Hedwig taught him in his early days. So Hedwig, in true b!tchy fashion, follows Tommy's rock tour around the world. But instead of playing in theaters and high end places, Hedwig and his Angry Inch band play at lowbrow restaurants, often to the dismay of its patrons who've simply come in to eat.Hedwig's decline into obscurity is well played by director/actor John Cameron Mitchell. The musical soundtrack is very well done and the catchy tunes will have most movie watchers tapping their toes along to the rockin' beats. That he also remains angry at some of his band members is quite funny, actually holding them hostage by keeping their passports hidden away.Revenge is the meal of the day as Hedwig finally meets up with Tommy again, eventually leading to Tommy's career demise and launching Hedwig into the spotlight. But is this what Hedwig really wanted? Not realizing the sacrifices she'd have to make, Hedwig decides to re-open her/his closet and show the world his/her true identity. He also sets free one of his band members who turns out to be a woman masquerading as a man, too.Those willing to watch a film without sitting in judgement of the material will most likely eat this story up. It's quite funny, well acted, and has a rippingly good soundtrack.

Well, it's a little campy but it's also sad and somewhat tragic, making this a very grown up rock opera.John Cameron Mitchell plays Hedwig (formally Hansel) Robinson, a young German man who escapes Berlin with the help of an American serviceman. The two are lovers and Hansel must become Hedwig if he is to make it past the U.S. inspectors. So an operation is had, but the results are less than satisfying. Hedwig makes it to America, but there's still an inch of Hansel left. Hedwig is eventually abandoned by his/her lover. He/She experiments with music and soon mentors future rock star Tommy Gnosis. The movie starts with Hedwig far from being a ""has been"". Hedwig is a ""never was"" and is only able to score gigs at  roadside Holiday Inns. All the while Hedwig's discipline, Tommy Gnosis, is a mega star, making millions off the very songs Hegwig wrote.We learn about Hedwig's life through the movie's songs and through effective flashbacks. There is much pain in Hedwig's life and the result turn him/her into a bitter bitch who only seems to find motivation in bringing everyone else around him/her crashing down. The end of the movie provides a sort of showdown between Hedwig and Gnosis. Hedwig gets his/her chance at fame but more importantly, Hedwig gets  a shot at enlightenment. Is he Hedwig? Is he Hansel? Is he Gnosis? Or is he something else...something he's been looking for since before he was anything.

B Collins Jr.,"[3, 3]","I found that I liked everything about this film; the plot/story line, the acting, the musical score, the whole package.The story of a young East German boy, reared by an unbalanced mother, seduced by a handsome African American soldier, and the victim of a botched sex change operation, is compelling and certainly confronts the issue of how we deal with adversity and reach some sense of inner peace with all those that have transgressed against us and with those whom we have transgressed upon.  The sly manner in which Platonic philosophy is weaved into the story was great. Plato's theories of gender differentiation is integrated into a rock song with cartoons!  Hedwig was dealt a bad hand, over and over, from his/her abandonment in a Midwest trailer park by her African American Sugar Daddy to the theft of her music by a young rocker for whom she once baby-sat. Yet it is reconciliation with the movement of life's ups and downs that is the real point of the story. Hedwig has been abandoned so many times that his/her radar is out for any disloyalty in her band - an obsession that eventually drives them away for a while. Yet, once Hedwig is told by Tommy Gnosis, the young rock star, that he acknowledges (sings) her major contribution to his success, she is able to allow her lead guitarist to move into the spotlight of a transgender rock star.The acting in this film is super but John Cameron Mitchell is totally over the top. His acting is superb by any measure. His comedic timing is fantastic - delivering wonderful lines with just the right amount of sarcasm and nihilism. Tommy asks: Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your Savior? to which Hedwig calmly states: No but I love his work.  Mitchell's musical performances were as high powered as the dramatic acting. A rock musical is not the easiest idiom to control and master, yet Mitchell excelled.Stephen Trask's musical score was exceptional. Like an opera, the score must fluctuate between the grand and the intimate, which is exactly what the score from this DVD offers.I was impressed by the whole dramatic musical package presented here.

And when I hear from enough people that a film is good, I try to make time for it.I heard from enough people that &quot;Hedwig&quot; was good but I couldn't get all that anxious to see it. I'd seen the preview. It reminded me of &quot;Priscilla,&quot; drag queen on the road, ho-hum. I just assumed I knew what I was going to see.I haven't been so wrong about a movie since I was dragged to see &quot;Election,&quot; all the while complaining, &quot;Who cares about a movie about a high school campaign?&quot; Well, it turned out, I did. And very much.Same situation with this film. From the moment Hedwig lifts her wing-like cape and launches into the first song, I was wide-eyed.John Cameron Mitchell's performance would be amazing even if he hadn't written and directed the movie. Since he did, I'd say that it's one of the most astonishing triple-threat debuts since &quot;Citizen Kane.&quot; Hold on: I'm not saying it's as good as &quot;Citizen Kane,&quot; I'm saying it's somewhere on that list. But that's a good list to be on.I want to also point out a great performance by the actor who played Yitzak, but I fear that saying too much might spoil one of the movies better surprises (whether you caught on from the get-go or near the end, it's still a nice reversal).

675926,A2DAAPYZTJ9PZA,B00005QW5X,C. Moon,"[11, 38]","I can see how this film would be popular with a certain audience.  Hedwig is one of those cutsey/artsy films that is clearly in origin intelligent enough to be really great but seems so caught up in its gimick rather than getting down to telling a story that in the end I couldn't consider this film anything more than a failure.True, there are plenty of films that don't have half the talent that Hedwig does, but its just that promise with a failure to deliver that's so frustrating.  So, let's itemize this nonesense:1.  If you don't love the music, forget it.  The obvious nods to Bowie are certainly enjoyable, but the music literally pads out over half the movie.  In a true musical, we actually have the narrative of the story explained and strengthened through the songs.  At times it feels like Hedwig was doing this but most of the time it seems like they were having more fun doing fake music performances.  Why not just watch Spinal Tap instead?  Because the songs take up the majority of the film and bring the tiny amount of narrrative flow in the movie to a near standstill, unless you're absolutely enthralled with the music in Hedwig, the film can't help but dissapoint.2. What I was waiting to develop during all those songs was a great story that just didn't happen.  I was actually interested in main character and many of the unexplained side characters.  The fact that hedwig was a TRUE freak among a profession of poesers was absolutely fascinating.  Did the movie bother to explore any of this?  Absolutely not.3. What we get instead of an actual resolution to the nonexisting story is a rather inept attempt at a freak-out ending, complete with sets that were formerly all black changing to all white, Hedwig rips off his/her close, walking around near naked and looking identical to his love/hate boyfriend Tommy.  There's supposed to be something deep with how men and women used to be one being and were split, but it feels as though it was carried off so incompetantly or simply incompletely that whatever message the director was intending feels utterly lost--meaning that really the last 20 minutes are essentially a waste.I'm left wondering why this film has received such a high rating and so many positive reviews.  Where other films have explored similiar grounds with much greater effectiveness, Hedwig seems only capable of raising them, singing about them, but then gives up.  Or perhaps it was just one big music video?  Hedwig certainly isn't the worst film I've seen by any measure, rather, it isn't a movie.

675930,AC0Z6U9OWFRT0,B00005QW5X,Daniel Maltzman,"[12, 14]","A popular off-Broadway cult hit in the late 90s, a motion picture version of John Cameron Mitchell's ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" finally saw a release in 2001. Only four years since it was released as of this writing, the film has already achieved legendary status. Along with ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show,"" (1975) ""Tommy"" (1975) and the newcomer ""Velvet Goldmine"" (1998), ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" is regarded as a rock n' roll movie classic.Why has ""Hedwig"" achieved such adoration as well as critical acclaim? What is it, exactly; do people see in this movie? What's the appeal? Many other reviewers and sources have detailed descriptions of the plot, so I won't go into a detailed synopsis. Instead, I will state why I personally love this movie.""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" has been labeled ""gay camp,"" or otherwise an empowerment of gay culture and identity. While this is true, ""Hedwig"" is much more than that. ""Hedwig"" transcends being a gay cult film. While it is a film that celebrates diversity and sexuality, it mostly celebrates being true to yourself, of accepting yourself for who you are. Hedwig (Mitchell) uses what she ""has to work with,"" just like everyone. No matter whom you are or what your sexuality is, there is a little bit of Hedwig in everybody.A major theme of ""Hedwig"" that so many can relate to is unrequited love. She spends her whole life, every waking moment searching for her ""other half."" She thinks it may be Tommy, or maybe Yitzhak?The way in which the movie plays out is pure enchantment. The colorful cinematography, illustrations, musical score, anecdotes, and songs are a delight to all senses. From the gummy bear scene, to the food fight, to the singing in the oven, to the band of Korean housewives, to the grand finale, every scene is mesmerizing.As we witness Hedwig's formative years, to her failed marriage, to her preoccupation and obsession with Tommy Gnosis, we are taken on a journey. It is a ride through anticipation, melancholy, anger, joy, and ultimately self-discovery.""Hedwig"" is a film that can be enjoyed on many levels. It can be enjoyed as camp and pure entertainment, or can be analyzed for deeper meaning. That makes it a film worth owning that can be seen again and again. Every time I watch this movie I pick up something new, or rethink a particular scene or line. This movie will make you laugh, make you sing, and make you think.Stephan Trask's songs are absolutely incredible. The songs in this film are as good as any of the bands they were inspired from (Lou Reed, David Bowie, Iggy Pop). As soon as I saw this film I had to buy the soundtrack and it remains a favorite of mine.The supporting cast is great. Miriam Shor gives an outstanding performance as Hedwig's lover Yitzhak, Andrea Martin as the dedicated agent, Ben Mayor-Goodman as a young Hedwig, and Michael Pitt as the bewildered Tommy.The DVD has a lot of cool extras that should please fans of the film.

And 'Hedwig and the Angry Inch' - the story of the transsexual leader of a 70s-style glam rock band, playing to restaurant audiences of single figures or less as she stalks the stadium rocker ex-lover who stole her songs; whose love life is a rondelay of promise, ecstasy, betrayal and rejection; whose dismal career forces her into prostitution - constantly teeters on the brink of the tragic.that it doesn't (quite) is largely due to the combusitble energy of the film, the inherent buoyancy of the musical genre, and the sympathy generated by John Cameron Mitchell's engaging performance, a classic queen's mixture of bravura and tears.  I say 'combustible' energy, because the film doesn't really have a plot, but moves like it does, and so threatens to expend itself - this can maim the emotional crescendos it strives for.  'Hedwig' was originally a stage musical, and the film works best as a kind of revue, with Hedwig on stage 'performing' and elucidating her life-story, illustrated by stylised, amusing, poignant flashbacks (the best being a candy-glutted sexual awakening at the hands of a huge Barry White-voiced American G.I.).the film mixes the musical, cabaret, the rites-of-passage, the (small-scale) show-biz satire and romantic comedy, with animation and collage, and the overall theme concerns unity and separation - Hedwig's anxieties about gender and sexual belonging; her origin as the son of an American soldier and East German communist, and how this relates to Cold-War Germany and the collapse of the Berlin Wall; the links between her life and work, her public persona and private emotions, the paradox that she finds her greatest emotional articulacy and authenticity caked in make-up, fright-wig and glittering clothes.while I would rather leap over sleeping alligators than listen to them in 'real' life, the songs, kind of Iggy/Ziggy/Velvets/New York Dolls rewritten by Jim Steinman, are hugely exciting, the audience even invited to sing along at one point (mine didn't), doing what songs in musicals should do - make the ordinary seem extraordinary, and give voice to the unspoken.

I sure as hell didn't when I first viewed this during the summer. I walked out of the theatre with a lot of hope for the future.Face it, actors/actresses don't know how to act anymore without exhibiting some degree of self-consciousness.

And the man is the first genuine rock and roll heart I have connected with in too long a time. Even though it's a ficticious character, he blows away a good percentage of today's, ahem, &quot;rock&quot;.The lovely Miriam Shor is terrific playing a man (in this case, Yitzak, Hedwig's love interest) and shows an amazing energy, dramtic flair and punk rock spirit. A ballsy performance and an excellent example of losing yourself in the role and making it effective.And the music? You like Punk, Gothic, Glam, Rockabilly, Heavy Metal, Psychedelia and good ol' knees up singalong? Look no further. This is some of the very best TRUE ROCK MUSIC (and Show music) that I have heard in ages. Catchy, nervy and rocks like hell.The film is a remarkable acheivement. What could have turned into a routine filmed performance or even a performance piece, is actually a fine story with great editing, energy and plenty of color. It could have been a garish display, but Mitchell has done the impossible by keeping the camp and making a truly focused work. Let's see more form him.The DVD comes with a remarkable 80+ miniute documentary about the history of &quot;Hedwig&quot; and interviews with all involved. This is truly indispensible stuff and highly entertaining.Multi-media pieces usually don't work in the cinematic realm. John Cameron Mitchell has succeeded in this impossible accomplishment and also created what is a long overdue creation in cult cinema.And that is? The first TRUE rival to &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot;. Give Rocky credit for starting the genre, but give John Cameron Mitchell plenty for taking it further and producing a labor of love on every level.I will never tire of &quot;Hedwig&quot;.

Best of all, (one or two interminable Jim Steinman-style power ballads aside) someone has finally nailed the MUSIC...most of the songs sound like they were indeed composed by Mssrs. Pop, Bowie, Reed or Bolan and would hold up alongside the original artists' work.

Sure, I'd heard the raves and critical appraisal, but the plot of the film didn't sound too appealing to me.  (SPOILERS>>>) After all, that's about a German homosexual/transvestite Glam-rock singer who marries an African American military man to come to America, where he has a relationship with a 17-year old son of a preacher who he later stalks because the kid stole his music to become a big rock star.  Hmm.  It certainly sounds like the plot came from waaaay out of left field.  BUT, that being said, I decided I would be adventurous one day and I borrowed this DVD from my local library.As I said, I wasn't too sure how I would react to this film, but very surprisingly, I ended up liking it a LOT.  The plot actually makes a lot of sense in the context of the film, and it's quite enjoyable.  Still, I suppose you would need a somewhat open mind to see this film.  If you've seen other films like ""Tommy,"" ""Performance,"" ""Liztomania,"" ""Rocky Horror Picture Show,"" ""Pink Floyd's the Wall,"" or even ""Moulin Rouge"" then you'll have a idea what this film is like.  However, the film is the best of the bunch.  How good is it?  It's better than Moulin Rouge by far and the music is from the original off-Broadway production and is just about the BEST rock music I've heard in any rock musical.  It totally kicks ...and rocks hard and had me humming the tunes to all the songs before long.  I believe if the Academy Awards folks had possessed a more open mind, they would have nominated this for best picture instead of Moulin Rouge.  Furthermore, only a technicality prevented any of the songs from being nominated for best song, which they could have easily won.Bless DVD technology...I practically had the songs from the film on auto-repeat for a few days before I had to return the DVD.  This is probably one of the best musicals to be released in the last 20 years (Little Mermaid and Evita and Everyone Says I Love You are some other great recent ones).  The DVD, to say a few words, has a commentary by the director, who is also the writer and plays Hedwig on-screen.  Plus, there is a cool 90-min documentary about the origin of the play and the film...really nice stuff!

On the contrary, I consider myself a pretty open minded person and am always up for something different.  I didn't know that I would be witnessing one of the most BIZARRE films that I'd ever seen.I really wanted to see this because John Cameron Mitchell, Hedwig/Hansel, was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Actor.  He was critically acclaimed, and after all the bad movies with even worse acting that I had seen in 2001, this couldn't be much worse.Well, This is just not for everybody.  Especially straight men that have a bit of a phobia for watching movies to do with gay men.(especially when the sex/love scenes arrive).  My husband left the room.  I on the other hand, watched the entire film with some dismay.  I do think that John Cameron Mitchell was totally amazing and gave a very riveting performance as the main character.  He had this great confidence in his acting, and seemed to really enjoy playing this character, Hedwig.I think that the direction and the pencil drawing animation is what I found bizarre, but not bad.The ending was the most bizarre part of all as I just lost all understanding and meaning of the movie.  What is it that they are trying to say here? It isn't all cut and dry, maybe I missed something that others saw.I think all the acting was very good, especially JCM.  He is very talented, and I imagine that the live show must be a real powerhouse of entertainment..for those that can appreciate this kind of show.It's not that I wouldn't recommend this movie at all.

It's because our main protagonist is unlike any before, with a slight nod towards Rocky Horror.Meet Hedwig. After a botched surgery that was intended to be a ticket out of Berlin, he finds himself on a razor's edge of insanity and angst. Lots of angst. And he wrote a song for each of those times. Looking into the Abyss and something is seen. But even then, he can't crawl out from the infinite mouth-like cave. Anyway, he meets a guy and there is chemistry. They grow into an awkward relationship. This is seen as a break-up when his main squeeze Tommy Spect up and steals all of Hedwing's music and adopted a moniker Tommy Gnosis. Tommy gets all the fame while Hedwig mostly gets on stage in sleazy bar and underwhelming concerts with a single fan in attendance. The whole movie hinges on Hedwig and Tommy, and once the film reaches the climax I was left with a breath of fresh air; too few movies create something as solid and insightful.Extra Features - commentaries, deleted scenes... all the normal fare. The Whether You Like it or Not documentary is a really good feature that shows the evolution of the Hedwig phenomena.Soundtrack - who cares? The only thing you should expect from the sound track is the songs. This is a musical, and after every emotional beat, someone (usually Hedwig) would burst into song... not just songs, these are movements of truth trying to escape from the B.S. and banality of the world.

675944,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B00005QW5X,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[11, 12]","Meet Hans, an East Berlin teenager desperate to escape the communist block who undergoes a botched sex change operation in order to marry an American military man and flee to the free world.  Now meet Hedwig, the rock-em-shock-em punk band leader into which Hans transforms himself when his American husband abandons him in the midwest.  Embittered when the Berlin wall falls and furious when a later teenage-lover steals her music and becomes an arena-filling rock star, Hedwig now dogs the teenager's steps by staging a tour with her own band and following him from town to town.John Cameron Mitchell, who co-wrote and starred in the New York show and who appears in the film as both director and star, mutes the more savage tones of the material in favor of pathos and a broader sense of the character's humanity; consequently, the film isn't really as far-out or edgy as it might seem, so it lacks the sharp bite you might expect.  The film also seems a bit unfocused, a bit unstructured, and at times I felt a bit frustrated by what it leads you to expect but never actually delivers.  Even so, Mitchell and company (especially Miriam Shor), give some extremely interesting and often drop-dead funny performances, and the music performed by the band as it tours is first rate throughout.Sadly, some viewers will reject the film without seeing it on the basis of subject matter alone--which would be a mistake.  Often funny, often touching, and certainly thought-provoking, HEDWIG packs a solid punch by appealing to the untapped creativity in all of us and leads us to question our own internal sense of unity.  The characters and ideas it presents linger in mind afterward, and while Hedwig and her angry inch aren't quite as knock-out as you could wish they're still fascinating.The DVD contains lots of extras, most notably a documentary (almost as long as the movie itself) that describes the creation of both stage show and film.

Hedwig (John Cameron Mitchell), born a boy named Hansel, is raised by a single mother (Alberta Watson) who wishes to see her son do better than his poverty-stricken family. Some years later, Hansel is attracted to a good-looking American G.I, who promises a better life overseas for young Hansel, under one condition: that he undergo a sex-change operation to become a fully functional female who he can then marry. The operation is seriously botched, leaving the now-renamed Hedwig with an ""angry inch"" only to be stranded in a dingy Kansas trailer park on the day the Berlin Wall comes tumbling down. Hedwig then supports herself through a series of ill-fated lounge gigs and side jobs, meeting up with 16-year old Tommy Gnosis (Michael Pitt), a religious type who befriends her and later steals her songs and becomes the rock star Hedwig always dreamed of being. Undeterred, Hedwig continues to perform in the shadow of Tommy's sold-out stadium tour, attempting to make herself whole in spirit, if not physically. The film features several songs by composer Stephen Trask, who also appears as a member of Hedwig's disinterested rock band; Miriam Shor portrays Hedwig's newfound love and back-up singer.A mixed-bag effort to translate John Cameron Mitchell and Stephen Trask's ambitious rock musical to the screen, this remains a worthwhile movie experience on any account, successfully opening up its heartfelt, often sad account of an ""internationally ignored"" rock singer suffering from a botched sex change operation. Mitchell's fierce, hypnotic performance is as indelible on film as it was on stage - fearful, hilarious and moving. His direction is a bit less remarkable, as the movie offers much to look at, but little of it comes through in quite the same way as the music. The filmmakers too often literalize what should be expressed musically, which robs the viewer of some of the discoveries that might have made the film more successful. A few stretches sag as well, but the movie springs to life the most in its final reel - when the title character takes on a young prot&eacute;g&eacute; (a quietly effective Michael Pitt) - even if it fails to fully reach its emotional mark. Audiences at the 2001 Sundance Film Festival clearly found Hedwig refreshing: it won the Audience Award as well as a Grand Jury directing prize for Mitchell.",5,Great!,1050883200,"04 21, 2003",2003,2555,"['Adapted', 'hit', 'off-Broadway', 'musical', 'same', 'name', 'tale', 'internationally', 'ignored', 'rock', 'roll', 'singer', 'who', 'Communist', 'Berlin', 'who', 'dreams', 'becoming', 'American', 'sensation', 'Hedwig', 'John', 'Cameron', 'Mitchell', 'born', 'boy', 'named', 'Hansel', 'raised', 'single', 'mother', 'Alberta', 'Watson', 'who', 'see', 'son', 'do', 'better', 'poverty-stricken', 'family', 'years', 'later', 'Hansel', 'attracted', 'good-looking', 'American', 'G.I', 'who', 'better', 'life', 'overseas', 'young', 'Hansel', 'one', 'condition', 'sex-change', 'operation', 'become', 'fully', 'functional', 'female', 'who', 'can', 'then', 'marry', 'operation', 'seriously', 'botched', 'leaving', 'now-renamed', 'Hedwig', 'angry', 'inch', 'only', 'be', 'stranded', 'dingy', 'Kansas', 'trailer', 'park', 'day', 'Berlin', 'Wall', 'tumbling', 'down', 'Hedwig', 'then', 'series', 'ill-fated', 'lounge', 'gigs', 'side', 'jobs', 'meeting', 'up', '16-year', 'old', 'Tommy', 'Gnosis', 'Michael', 'Pitt', 'religious', 'type', 'who', 'later', 'steals', 'songs', 'rock', 'star', 'Hedwig', 'always', 'dreamed', 'being', 'Undeterred', 'Hedwig', 'perform', 'shadow', 'Tommy', 'sold-out', 'stadium', 'tour', 'attempting', 'make', 'herself', 'whole', 'spirit', 'not', 'physically', 'film', 'several', 'songs', 'composer', 'Stephen', 'Trask', 'who', 'also', 'member', 'Hedwig', 'disinterested', 'rock', 'band', 'Miriam', 'Shor', 'Hedwig', 'newfound', 'love', 'back-up', 'singer.A', 'mixed-bag', 'effort', 'translate', 'John', 'Cameron', 'Mitchell', 'Stephen', 'Trask', 'ambitious', 'rock', 'musical', 'screen', 'worthwhile', 'movie', 'experience', 'account', 'successfully', 'opening', 'up', 'heartfelt', 'often', 'sad', 'account', 'internationally', 'ignored', 'rock', 'singer', 'suffering', 'botched', 'sex', 'change', 'operation', 'Mitchell', 'fierce', 'hypnotic', 'performance', 'indelible', 'film', 'was', 'stage', 'fearful', 'hilarious', 'moving', 'direction', 'bit', 'less', 'remarkable', 'movie', 'much', 'look', 'little', 'quite', 'same', 'way', 'music', 'filmmakers', 'too', 'often', 'literalize', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'expressed', 'musically', 'robs', 'viewer', 'discoveries', 'might', 'have', 'made', 'film', 'more', 'successful', 'few', 'stretches', 'sag', 'as', 'well', 'movie', 'springs', 'life', 'most', 'final', 'reel', 'when', 'title', 'character', 'young', 'prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'quietly', 'effective', 'Michael', 'Pitt', 'even', 'fully', 'reach', 'emotional', 'mark', 'Audiences', '2001', 'Sundance', 'Film', 'Festival', 'clearly', 'found', 'Hedwig', 'refreshing', 'won', 'Audience', 'Award', 'as', 'well', 'Grand', 'Jury', 'directing', 'prize', 'Mitchell']",Hedwig and the Angry Inch

Aside from the truly great music (which I'll discuss in a minute) the story of Hedwig and the Angry Inch is a sad tale of surprising depth, encompassing loneliness, betrayal, sexual confusion and identity crises as well as a bit of simplistic but kindly treated Platonic philosophy, with a brilliant ending that leaves many question marks and is good for hours of debate and discussion.Hedwig and the Angry Inch is certainly not, as some reviewers point out, a niche film to be enjoyed only by homosexuals - though I imagine you'd probably have some problems with it if you're particularly homophobic or conservative. As long as you're open-minded, Hedwig (meaning both the film and the character) has the power to appeal and to move everyone; I haven't seen the stage version - Many people say that other actors who played Hedwig were better than John Cameron Mitchell - but John is absolutely electrifying in this role, surprisingly appealing and charismatic, as well as recognizable (which is quite surprising when you're talking about a transvestite glam-rocker from East Germany), and he acts and sings with all his guts. The fact that he is also the writer and the director, I think, really shows and it's for the best; the film is very personal, and you can tell from his acting that the character is all his own. Miriam Shor and Michael Pitt are both amazing in the supporting roles.Even if all of that doesn't work for you, the music is where the film really stands out, and it's also the biggest point of difference between it and Rocky. While Rocky was created and inspired by the glam rock scene, the music - with maybe a couple of exceptions, like the wonderful and biting 'Sweet Transvestite' - is the stuff of Broadway, or at least Off-Broadway. That's not putting it down; it was intentional. The music on the Rocky Horror Picture Show is for the most part musical parody, pop tunes of sarcasm and wonderful dark humor. The songs on Hedwig are much more serious business, and much more complex, too, and most of them sound like they might have been recorded by David Bowie at the very height of his career. The rockier, harder songs like 'Angry Inch', 'Exquisite Corpse' and the spectacular, show-stopping opener 'Tear Me Down' sound like Ziggy Stardust mixed with Iggy Pop and tossed twenty five years into the future, with heavenly power chords and thundering bass and drums; 'The Origin Of Love' is an amazingly beautiful epic rock ballad with gorgeous lyrics; 'Wig In A Box' is a spectacular pop song which is so catchy it would have made a mega-hit were it released in the 70s; and the closing song 'Midnight Radio' is so classic a power ballad that you'll find your hand immediately reaching for the lighter. The band is fantastic, they have a terrific sound and are all great musicians, but they let Mitchell have all the attention he deserves. By the way, the music used in the shooting is playback as is usually the case in such movies, but John's vocals were recorded live, and it shows in his very emotional and powerful performances that have the feel of a live concert. Also, each song - especially 'The Origin Of Love' and 'Wig In A Box' - is shot as a perfect video clip. The band members, though they are not actors, and hardly talk at all, all look great on film and are pretty funny guys, too.In conclusion, let's just say it's a great film and get it over with. It's not a trash film, or a cult film, or a gay film. Just a great musical and a great film overall. I dare you not to run and buy the soundtrack after you watch it.",5,"Don't you know me, Kansas City?...

675955,A366S12KCZ280V,B00005QW5X,"Janet Chandler ""Music/Movie Lover""","[0, 0]","...You are going to love ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"". It is delightful, funny and at time poignant with a fantastic musical score wrapped around it. Originally an off broadway play created by and starred John Cameron Mitchell who then made into a movie. It is about a transsexual rock and roll singer from East Berlin who comes to the United States to find her fame and fortune. Along the way she meets a young man that she helps develope into a big time rock singer who then leaves her stealing her songs and taking credit for them in the process. The movie has hilarious moments along side touching moments as well as Hedwig as a new woman in a new country tries to understand her place in the world. It is a feeling that all of us, not just transgendered individuals, have felt at some point in out lives. That is where I think ""Hedwig"" is a better movie then ""Rocky Horror"". Not that I don't like ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" because I definately do. ""Rocky Horror"" rates as one of the greatest cult movies of all time. But ""Hedwig"" deals with emotions and situations that can bring the movie to a more personal experience for the viewer again whether the viewer is transgendered or not.The acting in the film is first rate as well as the directing. The storytelling is clever as well with the use of animation at various points to help tell the story. Throw in the fact that the soundtrack is amazing with some kick@$$ songs just helps to make the experience of watching ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" all the more enjoyable to watch. In fact if you find in watching ""Hedwig"" that you love the music, as well as the movie, as much as I do then you need to get yourself the soundtrack album. While in the movie you get just snippets of some of the songs from the film, the soundtrack album plays all the songs in their entirerty. That is important since the songs themselves also play an important part in helping to tell the story.

It had all the earmarks of potential disaster for me. I'm not real found of female impersonation, particularly in a sustained artistic form such as a film. Then there are the inevitable comparisons between HEDWIG and other similiar genre like ROCKY HORROR SHOE, PRISCILA OF THE DESERT, etc. I enjoy comedy, and I also enjoy substance. The world of female impersonation/drag queens can be extraordinarily superficial, filled with an angst that can be met with a world weary response like ""So, what?""Let me start with the nuts & bolts, like John Cameron Mitchell's form of gender bending & his musical lyrics & routines. He conveys a great depth to Hedwig without being mired in pathos or mere impersonation. Visually his chracter(s) are stunningly realistic (given the unreality of the world in which s/he lives.) The songs are fantastic, somewhere like a cross between T-Rex & Talking Heads. Some of the animation interjected reminded me of Bjork music videos. Not a great lover of musicals, I found myself actually looking forward to the next number.Pertaining to the Gnostic element, a major theme in the film, it involves Hedwig's relationship with a boy who talks like a Jesus freak, but there is a much deeper level to his spiritual view--and it interacts with Hedwig's views on The Origin of Love. Either intentionally or not, it is almost a classic Gnostic interpretation of The Garden of Eden story of The Fall of Man. The fact that Hedwig invents the name of Tommy Gnostic for her lover may indicate that the artist knew exactly what s/he was doing when it came to the Gnostic theme.I say ""artist"" because this film is the creation of a great artist in association with other obviously great artists.It's is EXTREMELY entertaining too.",5,"Gnostic-Gender-Bending ""The Origin of Love""",1247356800,"07 12, 2009",2009,1944,"['People', 'who', 'know', 'will', 'look', 'title', 'gave', 'review', 'did', ""n't"", 'already', 'think', 'so', 'say', 'Oh', 'now', 'poor', 'ol', 'thing', 'finally', 'lost', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'really', 'liked', 'movie', 'had', 'earmarks', 'potential', 'disaster', ""'m"", 'not', 'real', 'found', 'female', 'impersonation', 'particularly', 'sustained', 'artistic', 'form', 'such', 'film', 'Then', 'are', 'inevitable', 'comparisons', 'HEDWIG', 'other', 'similiar', 'genre', 'ROCKY', 'HORROR', 'SHOE', 'PRISCILA', 'THE', 'DESERT', 'etc', 'enjoy', 'comedy', 'also', 'enjoy', 'substance', 'world', 'female', 'impersonation/drag', 'queens', 'can', 'be', 'extraordinarily', 'superficial', 'filled', 'angst', 'can', 'be', 'met', 'world', 'weary', 'response', 'So', 'what', 'Let', 'start', 'nuts', 'bolts', 'John', 'Cameron', 'Mitchell', 'form', 'gender', 'bending', 'musical', 'lyrics', 'routines', 'great', 'depth', 'Hedwig', 'being', 'mired', 'pathos', 'mere', 'impersonation', 'Visually', 'chracter', 's', 'are', 'stunningly', 'realistic', 'given', 'unreality', 'world', 's/he', 'lives', 'songs', 'are', 'fantastic', 'somewhere', 'cross', 'T-Rex', 'Talking', 'Heads', 'animation', 'interjected', 'reminded', 'Bjork', 'music', 'videos', 'Not', 'great', 'lover', 'musicals', 'found', 'actually', 'looking', 'forward', 'next', 'number.Pertaining', 'Gnostic', 'element', 'major', 'theme', 'film', 'Hedwig', 'relationship', 'boy', 'who', 'Jesus', 'freak', 'much', 'deeper', 'level', 'spiritual', 'view', 'Hedwig', 'views', 'Origin', 'Love', 'intentionally', 'not', 'almost', 'classic', 'Gnostic', 'interpretation', 'Garden', 'Eden', 'story', 'Fall', 'Man', 'fact', 'Hedwig', 'name', 'Tommy', 'Gnostic', 'lover', 'may', 'indicate', 'artist', 'knew', 'exactly', 'what', 's/he', 'was', 'doing', 'when', 'came', 'Gnostic', 'theme.I', 'say', 'artist', 'film', 'creation', 'great', 'artist', 'association', 'other', 'obviously', 'great', 'artists.It', 'EXTREMELY', 'entertaining', 'too']",Hedwig and the Angry Inch

The problem is that I keep trying to say everything I want to say about it, and there just isn't enough time or space in this world for it all.I saw Hedwig live many times at the Jane Street Theatre in NYC. I loved her so much there that I refused to see the movie for many years. Not until after I'd seen Shortbus on DVD in the summer of 2008 did I go back and watch Hedwig, to see if it could possibly be as bad as Shortbus was. Not only was it not, it was so GOOD that it made Shortbus even more inexplicable.I'm not going to go into all the details of why I love Hedwig so much. Stephen Trask's songs are just marvelous, as they always were, and the added movie score is great; John Cameron Mitchell and Michael Pitt are wonderful in the two lead roles (Mitchell's crazed Hedwig dancing and his extreme closeups singing straight into the camera get to me especially; Pitt is perfect as Tommy and does the best lip-syncing ever); and I can't even begin to say what an unbelievably brilliant job Mitchell has done in bringing Hedwig to the screen.I never imagined I'd say this, but the movie is BETTER than the live show. It's more accessible, human, touching, moving, beautiful, and on and on and on. I watch it over and over, and it gets richer and more fun and more rewarding every time. I'm very grateful to Mitchell, Trask and everybody else involved for creating Hedwig, and then for making her available anywhere, everywhere, forever.Thank you, guys!

And that light, my friends is the genre of Movie Musicals. Finally after almost a 10 year dormancy. the genre is coming back and this movie is one of the best movie musicals I've seen in a long time. Based on one of the most risque Off-broadway musicals, This production was adapted, directed, and even starring John Cameron Mitchell one of the shows original creators. Mitchell has managed to adapt his work with seeming ease. The camera working is colorful, energetic, and intense. It doesn't miss any of the important details, and manages to make every scene a unique experience.The Story goes like this...Hansel, a homosexal, east german boy, is eager to escape the opressive atmosphere of East Germany. One day he meets a soldier. They want to get married and escape to America. But unfortunately Hansel needs a sex change operation. The operation is botched, leaving him with the so called &quot;Angry Inch&quot;. well upon arrival in Kansas. The now titled &quot;Hedwig&quot; is abandoned by his husband. Well soon afterwards we follow Hedwig's turbulent rise to glory as a rock star.Mitchell's work on this film is truly visionary, as well as original, striking, moving, and brilliant.

675962,AGCBE06XCLLM9,B00005QW5X,john b,"[13, 14]","I didn't go seeking Hedwig, someone else got me to watch it. I admit that I had my misgivings about doing so, having a dim knowledge of what the plot was about, and even 10 minutes into it, I was still thinking, ""Okay, I'm never going to like this.""So let me say one more thing: This movie is not for everyone.But it was for me.I really, really love this movie. Hedwig starts out in the beginning being a character that is almost too big for life, someone that you can believe exists but that you don't believe has a lot of depth to them. You start imagining that (s)he is one more glam-queen failed rock-star stereotype that has found her/his way into a movie. That's what threw me towards not liking this movie.But it's simply not true, not even vaguely. As the movie progresses, you start to see the subtle shades that this character possesses; you see the tragedies that have bounced this character through his/her life, see the triumphs that (s)he almost touched, you see the things that are important and that make her/him who (s)he is....and you begin to realize that Hedwig might be, just might be...beautiful.That's right. That's the conclusion I came to at the end of the movie, that despite all the strange and bad things that had beaten this character through his/her life, that at the end of the day the only thing that Hedwig really wanted was to be loved for who (s)he really is on the inside. That idea is what sets this movie ten leagues above other movies like it; it's an almost phantom-of-the-opera-ish idea, hiding behind the make-up and lights just to try and reach out to people who will never understand.There is also the idea of this being a sort of love story. It's not a boy-girl love story by any means but more of a soul-mate kind. Where is the other half that completes each of us? Who is it? What energy type is it? Masculine? Feminine? This movie takes that idea and blurs the edges, making us guess at it until the final scenes in the movie. It comes across in such a way as to make anyone think about the idea (no matter what their personal ideas on gender roles might be). It's presented in a very positive fashion.If you're going to watch this movie, let me at least point out the one thing that ought to be obvious (but should still be pointed out): Listen to the lyrics!!!! The songs are subtle (and great!) and help move the story along in a way that simple dialogue could never do. The anger and sadness that is built into them is inspiring to behold. This is what a modern musical should look like.The only thing I didn't like (and is worth noting) would be some of the sets. I didn't like the fold-down trailer that acted as a sort of stage for one of the movie's songs. I didn't like how tight the shots were when the boy (Gnosis) goes to watch Hedwig perform with his Asian back-up band (which was funny). Some of those things got on my nerves...but they are tiny, insignificant details that should never, ever keep you from seeing this movie.Bottom line: If you don't have inhibitions and want to enjoy a well-told tale with a lot of depth to it, this is a great movie!",5,Leave your walls behind,1125273600,"08 29, 2005",2005,3114,"['did', ""n't"", 'go', 'seeking', 'Hedwig', 'someone', 'else', 'got', 'watch', 'admit', 'had', 'misgivings', 'doing', 'so', 'having', 'dim', 'knowledge', 'what', 'plot', 'was', 'about', 'even', '10', 'minutes', 'was', 'still', 'thinking', 'Okay', ""'m"", 'never', 'going', 'like', 'So', 'let', 'say', 'one', 'more', 'thing', 'movie', 'not', 'everyone.But', 'was', 'me.I', 'really', 'really', 'love', 'movie', 'Hedwig', 'out', 'beginning', 'being', 'character', 'almost', 'too', 'big', 'life', 'someone', 'can', 'believe', 'exists', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'lot', 'depth', 'start', 'imagining', 's', 'one', 'more', 'glam-queen', 'failed', 'rock-star', 'stereotype', 'found', 'her/his', 'way', 'movie', 'what', 'threw', 'not', 'liking', 'movie.But', 'simply', 'not', 'true', 'not', 'even', 'vaguely', 'movie', 'start', 'see', 'subtle', 'shades', 'character', 'see', 'tragedies', 'have', 'bounced', 'character', 'his/her', 'life', 'see', 'triumphs', 'almost', 'touched', 'see', 'things', 'are', 'important', 'make', 'her/him', 'who', 's', '.and', 'begin', 'realize', 'Hedwig', 'might', 'be', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'right', 'conclusion', 'came', 'end', 'movie', 'strange', 'bad', 'things', 'had', 'beaten', 'character', 'his/her', 'life', 'end', 'day', 'only', 'thing', 'Hedwig', 'really', 'wanted', 'was', 'be', 'loved', 'who', 's', 'really', 'inside', 'idea', 'what', 'movie', 'leagues', 'other', 'movies', 'almost', 'phantom-of-the-opera-ish', 'idea', 'hiding', 'make-up', 'lights', 'just', 'try', 'reach', 'out', 'people', 'who', 'will', 'never', 'understand.There', 'also', 'idea', 'being', 'sort', 'love', 'story', 'not', 'boy-girl', 'love', 'story', 'means', 'more', 'soul-mate', 'kind', 'Where', 'other', 'half', 'Who', 'What', 'energy', 'type', 'Masculine', 'Feminine', 'movie', 'idea', 'blurs', 'edges', 'making', 'guess', 'final', 'scenes', 'movie', 'such', 'way', 'make', 'anyone', 'think', 'idea', 'matter', 'what', 'personal', 'ideas', 'gender', 'roles', 'might', 'be', 'presented', 'very', 'positive', 'fashion.If', ""'re"", 'going', 'watch', 'movie', 'let', 'least', 'point', 'out', 'one', 'thing', 'ought', 'be', 'obvious', 'should', 'still', 'be', 'pointed', 'out', 'Listen', 'lyrics', 'songs', 'are', 'subtle', 'great', 'help', 'move', 'story', 'way', 'simple', 'dialogue', 'could', 'never', 'do', 'anger', 'sadness', 'built', 'inspiring', 'behold', 'what', 'modern', 'musical', 'should', 'look', 'only', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'worth', 'noting', 'would', 'be', 'sets', 'did', ""n't"", 'fold-down', 'trailer', 'acted', 'sort', 'stage', 'one', 'movie', 'songs', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'how', 'tight', 'shots', 'were', 'when', 'boy', 'Gnosis', 'watch', 'Hedwig', 'perform', 'Asian', 'back-up', 'band', 'was', 'funny', 'things', 'got', 'nerves', 'are', 'tiny', 'insignificant', 'details', 'should', 'never', 'ever', 'keep', 'seeing', 'movie.Bottom', 'line', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'inhibitions', 'want', 'enjoy', 'well-told', 'tale', 'lot', 'depth', 'great', 'movie']",Hedwig and the Angry Inch

Years ago, someone told me John Cameron Mitchell's Hedwig was a hottie and that this movie changed her life. Not having seen it, I asked if she meant as Hansel or Hedwig. When she said ""both"" it seemed time for her meds!But she was right.  Now that I've seen ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" he's extremely hot in this movie, in both forms. Not just in looks; his performance, his personality, excitement and energy transcend the physical. And yes, it sounds crazy - but Hedwig and the Angry Inch has the capability to help change your life, if you let in its underlying messages and try to apply them.That's not enough to make someone love this movie, though. Almost, but not quite.What pushes it over the top the fact HATAI is one of the most inventive, hilarious, heartfelt pieces of art I've ever witnessed. Not to gush. I see a lot of movies and seldom does one feel that heady rush of passionate excitement for a film. For Hedwig, I did.

I say it's in a category of it's own.  And it completely blew me away.Hedwig is the most outrageous transsexual character that has ever graced the stage or screen.

We see his childhood in East Germany, his romance with an army sergeant, the pressure he feels to have a gender change operation in order to marry his love and leave the oppression of the communist world.  This story and the subsequent plot complications are told in flashback against a background of original rock music, whose lyrics throb with the meaning of love and the nature of gender.  The sets are original and there's even a sequence where the audience is invited to sing along by following a bouncing ball.  The story races along and there are animation sequences as Hedwig searches after lost love and a quest for gender identification.  The costumes and wigs are magnificent and the camerawork makes the most of the space and balance of energy.  It's an elaborate production.  And it also has something important to say.I loved the lights, the action, the camera, the costumes, the music, the story.  But most of all I the loved the characters.  Hedwig is simply wonderful!

It follows the story of Hedwig Robinson, a german woman born as a man called Hansel in cold war Berlin on the Eastern side of the Berlin wall. Feeling trapped and isolated, the rock and roll obsessed Hansel wishes to get out of Berlin hoping for a better life. He meets the american soldier Luther Robinson, who promises to marry Hansel and get him out of berlin. There is a catch; in order to be able to marry Luther, Hansel must undergo a full physical examination. In order to pass the examination, Hansel takes on the identity of a woman taking his mother's name (Hedwig Schmidt) and undergoes a sex-change operation, which unfortunatley goes awry and Hedwig is left with a small one-inch section of a penis. Sometime later, Luther and Hedwig have relocated to a small town in Kansas now, Luther has left her and now Hedwig must sit alone and watch as the Berlin wall comes down and is now alone. Hedwig gets a job babysitting for a local general while starting up a rock and roll band. She meets the teenager Tommy Speck (later known as Tommy Gnosis) and they develop a relationship while Hedwig sharpens Tommy's musical abilities. After discovering Hedwig's secret Tommy runs off, with all of Hedwigs music. Angry and hurt, Hedwig now travels around with her new band following Tommy. The music (written by Stephen Trask) tells Hedwigs story. John Cameron Mitchell sings the music with so much life you can feel what Hedwig feels. While there are many cross-dressing movies, this movie is simply beyond that. It examines the question of gender, what does it mean to be a woman? How can you define gender, biologically, socially?

Soon, I knew all the words to the brilliant songs by Stephen Trask, and with a second viewing of 'Hedwig' on DVD, it became my favorite film...the songs are absolutely phenomenal, Trask is one of the most talented songwriters I have ever had the pleasure of hearing...John Cameron Mitchell is exceptional in his role of Hedwig, and does an awesome job directing...the story of 'Hedwig' touched me like no other, and I still shed a tear upon each viewing...&quot;Hedwig and the Angry Inch&quot; is an amazing film, and my day is not complete without a viewing...in my opinion, this is THE best film ever made...a heartwarming, feel great film worth seeing over and over...I finally showed it to my 13-year old sister and she loved it...Trask and Mitchell are amazing...Hedwig Rocks!!!",5,The Best Film Ever Made-No Question,1009324800,"12 26, 2001",2001,1150,"['drove', 'West', 'Hollywood', 'summer', '2001', 'see', ""'Hedwig"", 'Angry', 'Inch', 'big', 'screen', 'was', 'discovering', 'indie', 'films', 'first', 'time', 'reading', 'review', ""'Hedwig"", 'knew', 'had', 'see', 'film', 'was', 'good', 'question', 'way', 'did', 'have', 'deep', 'impact', 'liked', 'enough', 'buy', 'soundtrack', 'listened', 'quite', 'often', 'Soon', 'knew', 'words', 'brilliant', 'songs', 'Stephen', 'Trask', 'second', 'viewing', ""'Hedwig"", 'DVD', 'became', 'favorite', 'film', 'songs', 'are', 'absolutely', 'phenomenal', 'Trask', 'one', 'most', 'talented', 'songwriters', 'have', 'ever', 'had', 'pleasure', 'hearing', 'John', 'Cameron', 'Mitchell', 'exceptional', 'role', 'Hedwig', 'awesome', 'job', 'directing', 'story', ""'Hedwig"", 'touched', 'other', 'still', 'shed', 'tear', 'viewing', 'quot', 'Hedwig', 'Angry', 'Inch', 'quot', 'amazing', 'film', 'day', 'not', 'complete', 'viewing', 'opinion', 'best', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'heartwarming', 'feel', 'great', 'film', 'seeing', 'finally', 'showed', '13-year', 'old', 'sister', 'loved', 'Trask', 'Mitchell', 'are', 'amazing', 'Hedwig', 'Rocks']",Hedwig and the Angry Inch

I had never heard of ""Hedwig"" before, though I had seen the box cover in numerous places, but never knew it.All I can say is whoa. I mean, WHOA! As rumor has it, Stephen Trask (the lyricist and also an ""Inch"" guitar player) first met John Cameron Mitchell on a plane to LA, where the story arose that inspired the two to make a show.Hedwig was originally a character developed at Don Hill's popular New York gay/rock nightclub scene, ""Squeezebox."" Mitchell, with the aid of friends like the famed Mistress Formika and Debbie Harry, turned what was described later as a ""very raw act"", into a smash hit.The dance and song routine turned into a New Tork hotel theater based, off-Broadway rock musical, and, in 2002, was big enough to transform into the phenomenal motion-picture it is today!In a nutshell, the plot of ""Hedwig"" is one of a would-be glam rocker failed transsexual from Communist East Berlin and her search for identity in America, after being dumped in Junction City by the US Army leiutenant who saved him. On the side, Hedwig(Mitchell,formerly German Hansel Schmidt, is on a Z-rate tour with her rock band, ""The Angry Inch"" which includes Yitzhak (Miriam Shor, also in drag, but as Hedwig's punk bandana-wearing love) and their agent, an over-the-top hilarious Andrea Martin. The tour is a rebuttal to the teen rock-star oppsite the Angry Inch, Tommy Gnosis (Michael Pitt), whom Hedwid taught everything he knew, and stole everything she had.  (I said a nutshell, did'nt I? Oops!)Mitchell's direction is suberb, the music is the greatest since ""Rocky Horror,"" and the acting has a certain reality hard to find in Hollywood today.The film will leave you stunned til' the last scene, or in tears, and maybe even a lesson or two.

Unfortunately even New Line decided to market this as a niche product -- comparing it to the Rocky Horror Picture Show.  Without knocking that film, which is a phenomenon of its own, Hedwig is in a different league.  While the style of Hedwig's band owes a lot to camp and to glam rock the film itself is never campy.  It has the music and power and vision of some of the great musical celebrations like The Wall and The Commitments, but has a more intimate feel than either of those.  It is, in style, closer to a documentary, and after watching this you will swear that Hedwig is not merely an invention of the actor and director John Cameron Mitchell but has a life of his own.Apart from enjoying the film quite a bit, I was also quite happy when I noticed that the song ""The Origin of Love"" is a retelling of the story Aristophanes tells in one of the most exciting of ancient books, Plato's Symposium -- of how in the beginning we were created as a unity of two and the gods saw that the contentment this generated made us too powerful and divided us, so that love is the longing for our other half.",4,Much more than a cult film -- a poignant and engaging story of love and loss,1205280000,"03 12, 2008",2008,1281,"['wo', ""n't"", 'repeat', 'summaries', 'film', 'only', 'want', 'say', 'much', 'more', 'cult', 'film', 'more', 'exciting', 'intriguing', 'fun', 'sad', 'most', 'films', 'out', 'there', 'Unfortunately', 'even', 'New', 'Line', 'decided', 'market', 'niche', 'product', 'comparing', 'Rocky', 'Horror', 'Picture', 'Show', 'knocking', 'film', 'phenomenon', 'own', 'Hedwig', 'different', 'league', 'style', 'Hedwig', 'band', 'lot', 'camp', 'glam', 'rock', 'film', 'never', 'campy', 'music', 'power', 'vision', 'great', 'musical', 'celebrations', 'Wall', 'Commitments', 'more', 'intimate', 'feel', 'style', 'closer', 'documentary', 'watching', 'will', 'swear', 'Hedwig', 'not', 'merely', 'invention', 'actor', 'director', 'John', 'Cameron', 'Mitchell', 'life', 'own.Apart', 'enjoying', 'film', 'quite', 'bit', 'was', 'also', 'quite', 'happy', 'when', 'noticed', 'song', 'Origin', 'Love', 'retelling', 'story', 'Aristophanes', 'one', 'most', 'exciting', 'ancient', 'books', 'Plato', 'Symposium', 'how', 'beginning', 'were', 'created', 'unity', 'two', 'gods', 'saw', 'contentment', 'generated', 'made', 'too', 'powerful', 'divided', 'love', 'longing', 'other', 'half']",Hedwig and the Angry Inch

Sturm,"[1, 5]","If you aren't into ""artsy"" films, here meaning a nonlinear story, random monologues, weird shots and very little exposition, this movie is not for you.  Going by that it's not for me either, but I was persuaded to watch it by the promise of good music and in that area, at least, I suppose it delivers.  The songs in H&TAI; have to convey a lot of the story as well as being properly ""deep"" and what I'd normally call pretentious, but whoever wrote them is a good lyricist and they're better crafted than any other aspect of the movie.  The music, too, is well-written to the point that none of it would sound out of place on the radio (with different words, sometimes, perhaps).  There's not really that many songs total, however.Regarding the movie as a whole, I'm ambivalent.  Hedwig's story is interesting, but my gosh are aspects of it creepy.  To be clear, it's not really the characters themselves who weird me out; rather, it's the typical art movie stuff they get up to.  Being gay (or transexual?) and having a botched operation?  Not creepy.  Lying in ruins and walking through streets naked, seducing a younger man with candy, and masturbating the teenage brother of a child you're babysitting?  All creepy as hell.  Nobody says or does anything natural seeming, cause that wouldn't be creative enough I guess.I think I could say good things about the main character's acting, if I saw more evidence of it.  There's very little non-monolouging dialogue, but the actor conveys some pretty honest seeming emotions (mostly crippling depression).  The same goes for some of the others as well.  The movie as a whole has a sort of flat tone, even when people are yelling or playing fairly hard-rocking songs.  I think it's an attempt at sophistication through extreme stylization.  You've got to read a lot into every small action to actually get a story out of this series of musical numbers and anecdotes.  Alternatively you can just look at the pretty pictures.I don't care about the movie's philosophy on love, truth and the power of rock or whatever it's trying to say.  I wanted to get to know Hedwig, but I don't feel like the movie shows us enough of her to let that happen.  I also wanted to like Hedwig and I kind of hated her (him, by the end?).  Like many people, I entirely lost the thread of the last few scenes.  Dunno if they even happened; they could have been a dream sequence.  Overall I don't find the movie very memorable, but I do have some suggestions as to who might like to watch it.  Basically, if you got all the way through Velvet Goldmine you should enjoy Hedwig just fine.  I... actually can't think of another audience who would appreciate it.  It's rated highly on Amazon, though, so don't mind me if you like and give it a shot.",2,There are better rock/ LGBT themed movies.,1365292800,"04 7, 2013",2013,2768,"['are', ""n't"", 'artsy', 'films', 'here', 'meaning', 'nonlinear', 'story', 'random', 'monologues', 'weird', 'shots', 'very', 'little', 'exposition', 'movie', 'not', 'Going', 'not', 'was', 'persuaded', 'watch', 'promise', 'good', 'music', 'area', 'least', 'suppose', 'songs', 'H', 'TAI', 'have', 'convey', 'lot', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'properly', 'deep', 'what', ""'d"", 'normally', 'call', 'pretentious', 'whoever', 'wrote', 'good', 'lyricist', ""'re"", 'better', 'crafted', 'other', 'aspect', 'movie', 'music', 'too', 'well-written', 'point', 'none', 'would', 'sound', 'place', 'radio', 'different', 'words', 'sometimes', 'perhaps', 'not', 'really', 'many', 'songs', 'total', 'however.Regarding', 'movie', 'whole', ""'m"", 'ambivalent', 'Hedwig', 'story', 'interesting', 'gosh', 'are', 'aspects', 'be', 'clear', 'not', 'really', 'characters', 'who', 'weird', 'out', 'rather', 'typical', 'art', 'movie', 'stuff', 'get', 'up', 'Being', 'gay', 'transexual', 'having', 'botched', 'operation', 'Not', 'creepy', 'Lying', 'ruins', 'walking', 'streets', 'naked', 'seducing', 'younger', 'man', 'candy', 'masturbating', 'teenage', 'brother', 'child', ""'re"", 'babysitting', 'creepy', 'hell', 'Nobody', 'anything', 'natural', 'seeming', 'cause', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'creative', 'enough', 'guess.I', 'think', 'could', 'say', 'good', 'things', 'main', 'character', 'acting', 'saw', 'more', 'evidence', 'very', 'little', 'non-monolouging', 'dialogue', 'actor', 'conveys', 'pretty', 'honest', 'seeming', 'emotions', 'mostly', 'crippling', 'depression', 'same', 'others', 'well', 'movie', 'whole', 'sort', 'flat', 'tone', 'even', 'when', 'people', 'are', 'yelling', 'playing', 'fairly', 'hard-rocking', 'songs', 'think', 'attempt', 'sophistication', 'extreme', 'stylization', ""'ve"", 'got', 'read', 'lot', 'small', 'action', 'actually', 'get', 'story', 'series', 'musical', 'numbers', 'anecdotes', 'Alternatively', 'can', 'just', 'look', 'pretty', 'pictures.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'movie', 'philosophy', 'love', 'truth', 'power', 'rock', 'whatever', 'trying', 'say', 'wanted', 'get', 'know', 'Hedwig', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'movie', 'let', 'happen', 'also', 'wanted', 'like', 'Hedwig', 'kind', 'hated', 'end', 'many', 'people', 'entirely', 'lost', 'thread', 'last', 'few', 'scenes', 'Dunno', 'even', 'happened', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'dream', 'sequence', 'Overall', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'movie', 'very', 'memorable', 'do', 'have', 'suggestions', 'who', 'might', 'like', 'watch', 'Basically', 'got', 'way', 'Velvet', 'Goldmine', 'should', 'enjoy', 'Hedwig', 'just', 'fine', 'actually', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'audience', 'who', 'would', 'appreciate', 'rated', 'highly', 'Amazon', 'though', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'like', 'give', 'shot']",Hedwig and the Angry Inch

Trying to get her name recognized for hits, she stalks ex-beau, Tommy Gnosis to catch a glimmer of the fame his has with her songs.  Of course the 'her' in this story was actually a 'him' from East Berlin.  Through a botched sex-change operation, (hence the title of the film) he has a confusing past of angry and bitter memories to conquer before finding his true self and a 'piece' (pardon the pun) of personal fame.

The movie just kind of fills you with this hope and love of life despite the calamities.

More astounding is that the material is used to great effect, and does both Aristophanes and Plato quite well.

It was either the most wonderful musical ever made, Rocky Horror with far more talent and watchability, Spinal Tap with drag queens and goths, or some twisted combination of all three that had one unfortunate casting decision. In any case, the movie had a whole lot going for it.Director Mitchell also stars as Hedwig, a transvestite whose sex change operation was botched, and thus lives in a constant state of bitterness and despair. Hedwig and her band, the Angry Inch, tour the U.S. playing horrible little holes while Hedwig's ex-boyfriend Tommy (Michael Pitt, recently seen in Murder by Numbers) has gone on to superstardom and is selling out arenas. But the plot is just a backdrop for the Ziggy Stardust-esque songs of the Angry Inch, some of which are accompanied by gorgeous videos of various types (Mitchell's animated sequences, while nave in construction, have an unmistakable power to them).The one place the movie goes horribly, painfully wrong is in the casting of Andrea Martin, a woman whose very presence is liable to set the viewer&#65533;s teeth on edge. She&#65533;s what would happen if, by some horrible accident of nature, Gilbert Gottfried and Carrot Top were suddenly able to have a child together.Other than that, though, a minor gem that was, not surprisingly, overlooked by Hollywood. *** ",4,Fun!,1049414400,"04 4, 2003",2003,1483,"['Hedwig', 'Angry', 'Inch', 'John', 'Cameron', 'Mitchell', '2001', 'been', 'week', 'finally', 'saw', 'Hedwig', 'Angry', 'Inch', 'still', 'cant', 'get', 'head', 'was', 'most', 'wonderful', 'musical', 'ever', 'made', 'Rocky', 'Horror', 'far', 'more', 'talent', 'watchability', 'Spinal', 'Tap', 'drag', 'queens', 'goths', 'twisted', 'combination', 'three', 'had', 'one', 'unfortunate', 'casting', 'decision', 'case', 'movie', 'had', 'whole', 'lot', 'going', 'it.Director', 'Mitchell', 'also', 'Hedwig', 'transvestite', 'sex', 'change', 'operation', 'was', 'botched', 'thus', 'lives', 'constant', 'state', 'bitterness', 'despair', 'Hedwig', 'band', 'Angry', 'Inch', 'tour', 'U.S.', 'playing', 'horrible', 'little', 'holes', 'Hedwig', 'ex-boyfriend', 'Tommy', 'Michael', 'Pitt', 'recently', 'seen', 'Murder', 'Numbers', 'gone', 'superstardom', 'selling', 'out', 'arenas', 'plot', 'just', 'backdrop', 'Ziggy', 'Stardust-esque', 'songs', 'Angry', 'Inch', 'are', 'accompanied', 'gorgeous', 'videos', 'various', 'types', 'Mitchell', 'animated', 'sequences', 'nave', 'construction', 'have', 'unmistakable', 'power', '.The', 'one', 'place', 'movie', 'horribly', 'painfully', 'wrong', 'casting', 'Andrea', 'Martin', 'woman', 'very', 'presence', 'liable', 'set', 'viewer', '65533', 'teeth', 'edge', '65533', 's', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'horrible', 'accident', 'nature', 'Gilbert', 'Gottfried', 'Carrot', 'Top', 'were', 'suddenly', 'able', 'have', 'child', 'together.Other', 'though', 'minor', 'gem', 'was', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'overlooked', 'Hollywood', '***']",Hedwig and the Angry Inch

Some of the wittiest, most outrageously delicious lines fall from the lips of Hedwig, the loveliest Eastern Berlin glam-Bloc girly boy to ever fall in love with an American soldier, only to become the angriest inch in the Junction City, Kansas trailer park.  Abandoned by hir new husband, Hedwig becomes a sensation in hir own mind, touring local restaurants with hir band comprised of Korean Army wives.  Along the way Hedwig meets and befriends a young Christian boy.  Hedwig falls in love.  The boy, Tommy Gnosis, steals all of hir songs and becomes a sellout rockstar.If that thread of the story wasn't sad, humorous and compelling enough on its own, the animated interweaving of Aristophanes' speech in Plato's Symposium is beautifully spun.  It is that smooth rendering against the garish and, angry world of Hedwig that the real story of transformation emerges.  Resting solely on the fluid dynamic of sexuality, it's easy to go into this film with that in focus as the prevailing theme.

Due to the cross-dressing element, there are many comparisons to &quot;Rocky Horror Picture Show,&quot; but I feel that these are two very separate films. A closer comparison is &quot;Cabaret,&quot; in the way &quot;stage performanceas a musical&quot; is used to interweave character's stories.  Like &quot;Cabaret,&quot; the musical is much changed in it's transfer to screen.  Characters are re-written and the all important &quot;feel&quot; goes missing.It was difficult to decide if the director was aiming for mocking the main characters by showing how seriously these pathetic people took themselves, in the vein of &quot;This is Spinal Tap&quot; and &quot;Waiting for Guffman,&quot;  or if he was going for something along the lines of &quot;Tommy&quot; where a savaged character found art within himself and transformed the people around him.  It is a difficult line to walk.  We are introduced to Hedwig in the bar scene, where he/she was an obvious object of ridicule, with the silly hairstyle and rock star performance in a small &quot;Denny's&quot; style restaurant.  Then later on, we are supposed to respect the plight of the same character that we had been trained to find humor in.Ultimately, I found no connection to any of the characters, and didn't particularly care whether or not Hedwig succeeded or failed.  I was sympathetic towards Hedwig's wife, and hopped that he/she escaped the vortex of Hedwig's self-fulfilling failure.  I was happy to see this character transformed at the end, and carried away from Hedwig (in my own mind, I am hoping that the hands carried him/her off to a staring role in &quot;Rent.&quot;)",3,Uneven translation to film,997056000,"08 6, 2001",2001,1704,"['quot', 'Hedwig', 'Angry', 'Inch', 'quot', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'Due', 'cross-dressing', 'element', 'are', 'many', 'comparisons', 'quot', 'Rocky', 'Horror', 'Picture', 'Show', 'quot', 'feel', 'are', 'two', 'very', 'separate', 'films', 'closer', 'comparison', 'quot', 'Cabaret', 'quot', 'way', 'quot', 'stage', 'musical', 'quot', 'used', 'interweave', 'character', 'stories', 'quot', 'Cabaret', 'quot', 'musical', 'much', 'changed', 'transfer', 'screen', 'Characters', 'are', 're-written', 'important', 'quot', 'feel', 'quot', 'missing.It', 'was', 'difficult', 'decide', 'director', 'was', 'aiming', 'mocking', 'main', 'characters', 'showing', 'how', 'seriously', 'pathetic', 'people', 'took', 'vein', 'quot', 'Spinal', 'Tap', 'quot', 'quot', 'Waiting', 'Guffman', 'quot', 'was', 'going', 'something', 'lines', 'quot', 'Tommy', 'quot', 'where', 'savaged', 'character', 'found', 'art', 'transformed', 'people', 'difficult', 'line', 'walk', 'are', 'introduced', 'Hedwig', 'bar', 'scene', 'where', 'he/she', 'was', 'obvious', 'object', 'ridicule', 'silly', 'hairstyle', 'rock', 'star', 'performance', 'small', 'quot', 'Denny', 'quot', 'style', 'restaurant', 'Then', 'later', 'are', 'supposed', 'respect', 'plight', 'same', 'character', 'had', 'been', 'trained', 'find', 'humor', 'in.Ultimately', 'found', 'connection', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'care', 'not', 'Hedwig', 'succeeded', 'failed', 'was', 'sympathetic', 'towards', 'Hedwig', 'wife', 'hopped', 'he/she', 'escaped', 'vortex', 'Hedwig', 'self-fulfilling', 'failure', 'was', 'happy', 'see', 'character', 'transformed', 'end', 'carried', 'away', 'Hedwig', 'own', 'mind', 'am', 'hoping', 'hands', 'carried', 'him/her', 'staring', 'role', 'quot', 'Rent.', 'quot']",Hedwig and the Angry Inch
