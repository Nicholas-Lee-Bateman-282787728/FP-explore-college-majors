1087533,AIMR915K4YCN,B000SSONO8,"Bindy Sue Frnknschtein ""bigfootsalienbaby""","[0, 1]","VAMPIRA (the late, great Maila Nurmi) tells her own story, w/ lots of inside stories, famous names (James Dean, Marlon Brando, et al), and a ""shocking"" tidbit involving VAMPI and an unsuspecting doorknob! At 82, Maila was still full of life and good humour (she reminds me of Ruth Gordon). It's fun to see / hear her in her own words. VAMPIRA is legendary, known mostly from her iconic appearance in PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE, she has since burned her way into the hearts of thousands (millions?) of fans. I thoroughly enjoyed her take on Ed Wood, his directing ""style"", and her first impression of the Maestro. Packed w/ tributes from such beloved immortals as Zacherley, Svenghouli, Count Smokula, Forest J. ""Famous Monsters"" Ackerman, The Misfits' Jerry Only, Sid Haig (Captain Spalding himself!), Bill Moseley, and ultimate amazon queen / goddess Julie Strain (Delta Delta Die) among other luminaries! We even get Cassandra Peterson (yep, Elvira) telling her side of the lawsuit story! My only quibble is that there's nowhere near enough 50s VAMPIRA TV footage. Still, there's enough here (including a coffin-full of extras) to satisfy the curious... P.S.- For those (like yours truly) who would absolutely LOVE to see the original VAMPIRA TV shows, we can only hope that their owner will finally relent, and allow the rest of us to watch them!...",4,My First And Favorite Ghoul-Fiend...,1236556800,"03 9, 2009",2009,1349,"['VAMPIRA', 'late', 'great', 'Maila', 'Nurmi', 'own', 'story', 'w/', 'lots', 'inside', 'stories', 'famous', 'names', 'James', 'Dean', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'et', 'al', 'shocking', 'tidbit', 'involving', 'VAMPI', 'unsuspecting', 'doorknob', '82', 'Maila', 'was', 'still', 'full', 'life', 'good', 'humour', 'Ruth', 'Gordon', 'fun', 'see', '/', 'hear', 'own', 'words', 'VAMPIRA', 'legendary', 'known', 'mostly', 'iconic', 'appearance', 'PLAN', '9', 'FROM', 'OUTER', 'SPACE', 'burned', 'way', 'hearts', 'thousands', 'millions', 'fans', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'take', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'directing', 'style', 'first', 'impression', 'Maestro', 'Packed', 'w/', 'tributes', 'such', 'beloved', 'immortals', 'Zacherley', 'Svenghouli', 'Count', 'Smokula', 'Forest', 'J', 'Famous', 'Monsters', 'Ackerman', 'Misfits', 'Jerry', 'Only', 'Sid', 'Haig', 'Captain', 'Spalding', 'Bill', 'Moseley', 'ultimate', 'amazon', 'queen', '/', 'goddess', 'Julie', 'Strain', 'Delta', 'Delta', 'Die', 'other', 'luminaries', 'even', 'get', 'Cassandra', 'Peterson', 'yep', 'Elvira', 'telling', 'side', 'lawsuit', 'story', 'only', 'quibble', 'nowhere', 'near', 'enough', '50s', 'VAMPIRA', 'TV', 'footage', 'Still', 'enough', 'here', 'including', 'coffin-full', 'extras', 'satisfy', 'curious', 'P.S.-', 'yours', 'truly', 'who', 'would', 'absolutely', 'LOVE', 'see', 'original', 'VAMPIRA', 'TV', 'shows', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'owner', 'will', 'finally', 'relent', 'allow', 'rest', 'watch']",Vampira The Movie
1087534,A1YOMI6M5M4W20,B000SSONO8,Chris Schmidt,"[4, 6]","The great thing about this movie is the interview with Maila Nurmi (Vampira). As the reviewer Ethan put it, she was ""fascinating, humorous, lovely and incredibly entertaining."" She was 82 years old when she did the interview. The movie would have been better with more of that, and less (or none) of the other interviews.Another really nice thing is the old footage of Maila. In one sequence she posed not as Vampira but as herself wearing a light blue bathing outfit. The other footage was from her TV show, as the Vampira character. I had thought there was no such footage available. I really wish this DVD included the old footage uncut and complete. In this movie, the old footage is sliced up and shown as excerpts.Another thing I liked were the glimpses of print media coverage of Maila and the Vampira character from that period. Again, I wish the entire material had been presented on the DVD, which would certainly have been technically possible, even if only as an appendix or special feature. I did pause the DVD to read the stories, but I could see only short excerpts of the text.I also liked the brief interview with Cassandra Peterson (Elvira), in which she talked about how her character was created, and about the law suit with Maila. (Maila did not tell her version on this DVD.)There you have a comprehensive list of all that is good about this movie. Everything else was terrible. Ethan and others have already done a better job than I could do explaining why this movie is terrible. I agree with everything Ethan wrote, and I particularly endorse his Lobster analogy. However, he left one thing out: the music, which was terrible in every respect.In this movie, the music during the opening credits was hard rock music that has no connection with Vampira or her era. We were assaulted again by similar terrible, anachronistic music during two montages later in the movie. You can turn the sound completely off during those parts. What is beyond forgivable is the electronic music (apparently composed for the film) that played during the interviews. Remember that the best thing about the movie is the extended interview with Maila? Practically throughout the interview you have to listen to really bad electronic music, obviously created well after the Vampira era. This annoying music is so unimaginative and formulaic that it may in fact have been ""composed"" by a computer program. Imagine watching a fascinating interview in a theater that's filled with a really bad smell, except something prevents you from holding your nose.When I started watching this movie, I anticipated hearing fun, kitschy music from the period, perhaps including bongo drums, a vibraphone, a theremin, and maybe a mono-syllabic soprano. With better choices in music, this movie would have risen above awful-terrible to passable. I had thought it would be nice to keep this movie to experience again the good stuff listed above, but I know I'll never again be willing to sit through the awful music that defaces the Maila interview.I just now watched this movie, and maybe you can tell I'm kind of angry. That's because I believe I was I was abused and tortured by the music, and because I believe the film maker defaced his precious material. This is a lesson for me in how our beliefs are responsible for negative emotions.",1,The music was worse than terrible,1251763200,"09 1, 2009",2009,3325,"['great', 'thing', 'movie', 'interview', 'Maila', 'Nurmi', 'Vampira', 'reviewer', 'Ethan', 'put', 'was', 'fascinating', 'humorous', 'lovely', 'incredibly', 'entertaining', 'was', '82', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'did', 'interview', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'more', 'less', 'none', 'other', 'interviews.Another', 'really', 'nice', 'thing', 'old', 'footage', 'Maila', 'one', 'sequence', 'posed', 'not', 'Vampira', 'wearing', 'light', 'blue', 'bathing', 'outfit', 'other', 'footage', 'was', 'TV', 'show', 'Vampira', 'character', 'had', 'thought', 'there', 'was', 'such', 'footage', 'available', 'really', 'wish', 'DVD', 'included', 'old', 'footage', 'uncut', 'complete', 'movie', 'old', 'footage', 'sliced', 'shown', 'excerpts.Another', 'thing', 'liked', 'were', 'glimpses', 'print', 'media', 'coverage', 'Maila', 'Vampira', 'character', 'period', 'Again', 'wish', 'entire', 'material', 'had', 'been', 'presented', 'DVD', 'would', 'certainly', 'have', 'been', 'technically', 'possible', 'even', 'only', 'appendix', 'special', 'feature', 'did', 'pause', 'DVD', 'read', 'stories', 'could', 'see', 'only', 'short', 'excerpts', 'text.I', 'also', 'liked', 'brief', 'interview', 'Cassandra', 'Peterson', 'Elvira', 'talked', 'how', 'character', 'was', 'created', 'law', 'suit', 'Maila', 'Maila', 'did', 'not', 'tell', 'version', 'DVD', 'have', 'comprehensive', 'list', 'good', 'movie', 'Everything', 'else', 'was', 'terrible', 'Ethan', 'others', 'have', 'already', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'could', 'do', 'explaining', 'why', 'movie', 'terrible', 'agree', 'everything', 'Ethan', 'wrote', 'particularly', 'endorse', 'Lobster', 'analogy', 'However', 'left', 'one', 'thing', 'music', 'was', 'terrible', 'respect.In', 'movie', 'music', 'opening', 'credits', 'was', 'hard', 'rock', 'music', 'connection', 'Vampira', 'era', 'were', 'assaulted', 'again', 'similar', 'terrible', 'anachronistic', 'music', 'two', 'montages', 'later', 'movie', 'can', 'turn', 'sound', 'completely', 'parts', 'What', 'forgivable', 'electronic', 'music', 'apparently', 'composed', 'film', 'played', 'interviews', 'Remember', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'extended', 'interview', 'Maila', 'Practically', 'interview', 'have', 'listen', 'really', 'bad', 'electronic', 'music', 'obviously', 'created', 'well', 'Vampira', 'era', 'annoying', 'music', 'so', 'unimaginative', 'may', 'fact', 'have', 'been', 'composed', 'computer', 'program', 'Imagine', 'watching', 'fascinating', 'interview', 'theater', 'filled', 'really', 'bad', 'smell', 'something', 'prevents', 'holding', 'nose.When', 'started', 'watching', 'movie', 'anticipated', 'hearing', 'fun', 'kitschy', 'music', 'period', 'perhaps', 'including', 'bongo', 'drums', 'vibraphone', 'theremin', 'maybe', 'mono-syllabic', 'soprano', 'better', 'choices', 'music', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'risen', 'awful-terrible', 'passable', 'had', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'keep', 'movie', 'experience', 'again', 'good', 'stuff', 'listed', 'know', ""'ll"", 'never', 'again', 'be', 'willing', 'sit', 'awful', 'music', 'Maila', 'interview.I', 'just', 'now', 'watched', 'movie', 'maybe', 'can', 'tell', ""'m"", 'kind', 'angry', 'believe', 'was', 'was', 'abused', 'tortured', 'music', 'believe', 'film', 'maker', 'defaced', 'precious', 'material', 'lesson', 'how', 'beliefs', 'are', 'responsible', 'negative', 'emotions']",Vampira The Movie
1087535,A3KDKURBSY5W61,B000SSONO8,Damon Devine,"[16, 24]","In the early 90's, there was an excellent documentary, a good two hours long with very well done visuals. This one comes nowhere near it. For someone who knows absolutely nothing about Vampira, it might be somewhat interesting. But if you are ""seasoned"" or knew her, you will find very little of value herein. The cover erroniously claims ""The SHOCKING TRUTH about Horror's First Host"" and there is nothing shocking of any kind in this DVD. It is very disjointed, and not in the ""artsy"" way, but in a way that makes the viewer think a true amateur made this brief film, and rather hastily at that.There are no rare photos (and Johnny Coffin could have well supplied hundreds---but maybe he wasn't asked) and no rare video footage, with the exception of a few seconds here and there from Vampira's TV show, but even that was shown in the mid 1990's on L.A.s channel 7 and can be seen on YouTube today. There were MANY more people they could have interviewed (myself included) who really KNEW the lady and could have given insight to the REAL person behind the Vampira persona. Instead, like so many other pieces on Vampira, they obsess over the 'Plan 9' thing, till you can hardly stand it any longer. This is not a ""deep"" documentary and you will learn nothing you couldn't find online, or in any Maila Nurmi interview. They never mention her Vampira Vegas act with Liberace, NOTHING of her films from the late 50's and early 60's, nothing about her ""black listed years"", nothing in depth about her personal life or what she did once her career was obviously over and so much more--not included.The extras contribute nothing to the whole project. In fact, they have little to do with Vampira at all.But if you actually COLLECT Vampira memorabilia, I guess you should buy it just for the sake of having it.

1087536,A2G3TECYO58ON7,B000SSONO8,Ethan D. Van Sciver,"[33, 34]","I just finished watching this documentary, and I've decided to be very, very kind, despite how frustrated I was watching it.  I'll give it the full five stars, because as a fan of ""The Wood Spooks"" this was the single best and most informative Maila Nurmi interview ever.  When she is on the screen, she is fascinating, humorous, lovely and incredibly entertaining.  Absolutely wonderful.Much of what she imparts here you may have heard before in prior Ed Wood related documentaries, but since those have always been edited in such a way as to retain focus on Wood, Maila's story was always a bit more vague.  Here, although intercut with some of the most useless and irritating sound bytes from poseurs and fans alike, she is for the most part allowed to speak her mind and tell her story, creating her own legend and spinning her own web as she'd like it to be understood.  This should have been the entire ""documentary"".  Point a camera at her, ask her a few guiding questions and let this woman speak.  Period.Instead, the director interrupts her with clips of horrible reenactment footage, nonsensical and off topic comments from lowlifes, and fan-made performances in tribute to Vampira.  This is his first error:  We don't wish to see or hear from these people, and it hurts your film.The second problem is that towards the end, the movie forgets what it's even about, turning into another round of contrary people tributing the great misunderstood genius Ed Wood.  Who cares how Lloyd Kaufman feels about the Golden Turkey Awards in this context?  Especially since he's only parroting sentiments made in The Plan 9 Companion by other contrary people.  It has nothing to do with Vampira, and if Ed Wood is spoken about at all, as I'm afraid he must be, it needs to be from the honest point of view of Maila Nurmi and NO ONE ELSE'S. It's called ""VAMPIRA THE MOVIE"" afterall.  The director can't seem to stay on topic.And so, look, what we have here is a beautiful 6 LB Maine Lobster prepared by a horrible chef.  I'm grateful for the clips from Vampira's old television show (which I'd assumed were gone forever) and for more of the wit and wisdom of this great lady.  I'm upset that I share my interest in her work with the characters that insist on squatting in this documentary.  Yet, I'm glad to add it to my library, and hope that by showing my enthusiasm for the subject matter, a more worthy film will be made soon.",5,Nice to hear from Maila again...,1193011200,"10 22, 2007",2007,2428,"['just', 'finished', 'watching', 'documentary', ""'ve"", 'decided', 'be', 'very', 'very', 'kind', 'how', 'frustrated', 'was', 'watching', ""'ll"", 'give', 'full', 'five', 'stars', 'fan', 'Wood', 'Spooks', 'was', 'single', 'best', 'most', 'informative', 'Maila', 'Nurmi', 'interview', 'ever', 'When', 'screen', 'fascinating', 'humorous', 'lovely', 'incredibly', 'entertaining', 'Absolutely', 'wonderful.Much', 'what', 'here', 'may', 'have', 'heard', 'prior', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'related', 'documentaries', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'edited', 'such', 'way', 'retain', 'focus', 'Wood', 'Maila', 'story', 'was', 'always', 'bit', 'more', 'vague', 'Here', 'intercut', 'most', 'useless', 'irritating', 'sound', 'bytes', 'poseurs', 'fans', 'alike', 'most', 'part', 'allowed', 'speak', 'mind', 'tell', 'story', 'creating', 'own', 'legend', 'spinning', 'own', 'web', ""'d"", 'like', 'be', 'understood', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'entire', 'documentary', 'Point', 'camera', 'ask', 'few', 'guiding', 'questions', 'let', 'woman', 'speak', 'Period.Instead', 'director', 'clips', 'horrible', 'reenactment', 'footage', 'nonsensical', 'topic', 'comments', 'lowlifes', 'fan-made', 'performances', 'tribute', 'Vampira', 'first', 'error', 'do', ""n't"", 'wish', 'see', 'hear', 'people', 'film.The', 'second', 'problem', 'end', 'movie', 'what', 'even', 'about', 'turning', 'round', 'contrary', 'people', 'tributing', 'great', 'misunderstood', 'genius', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'Who', 'how', 'Lloyd', 'Kaufman', 'Golden', 'Turkey', 'Awards', 'context', 'Especially', 'only', 'parroting', 'sentiments', 'made', 'Plan', '9', 'Companion', 'other', 'contrary', 'people', 'nothing', 'do', 'Vampira', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'spoken', 'about', 'all', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'must', 'be', 'be', 'honest', 'point', 'view', 'Maila', 'Nurmi', 'NO', 'ONE', 'ELSE', 'called', 'VAMPIRA', 'THE', 'MOVIE', 'afterall', 'director', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'stay', 'topic.And', 'so', 'look', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'beautiful', '6', 'LB', 'Maine', 'Lobster', 'prepared', 'horrible', 'chef', ""'m"", 'grateful', 'clips', 'Vampira', 'old', 'television', 'show', ""'d"", 'assumed', 'were', 'gone', 'forever', 'more', 'wit', 'wisdom', 'great', 'lady', ""'m"", 'upset', 'share', 'interest', 'work', 'characters', 'insist', 'squatting', 'documentary', ""'m"", 'glad', 'add', 'library', 'hope', 'showing', 'enthusiasm', 'subject', 'matter', 'more', 'worthy', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'made', 'soon']",Vampira The Movie

1087539,A3CJI5SSWKCKGR,B000SSONO8,"Mike from Canada ""Mike""","[1, 1]","A more difficult project then rating this attempt is defining what exactly it is.It's not a movie. I know that much. Kevin Michaels looks to me like he attempted to tell Maila Nurmi's story in biopic format with Maila telling the story of her life ( when prompted) & then there is the audio commentary dropped in over the visuals if you want a different take. Still with me? Good, because now it gets crazy. Insert a young woman who might have resembled Maila back in the day to in a limited way boost the product & allow us to visualize in a more real manner selected scenes ( from Maila's life) that presented a more youthful balance to the story. Add to that snipit communtary during the feature from seemingly every B Movie actor/actress, Vampira Wannabe, Horror Memorabilia person or just about every other person on the planet that ever heard the word Vampira uttered. Besides the non-movie there are the extras & there are lots of extras but the only 2 I appeciated was the Ted Mikels Limited Comments & the Count Smokula Vampira theme which is excellent. I give this DVD 3 stars. One star for Maila telling her story which I appreciate, 1 star for a million guest cameo appearances & 1 star for the Smokula Vampira theme & the only known/available footage from Vampira's Horror show from back in the day. If I was making this film I would have had an actress act out her life  from beginning to end, no interruptions & play her up. Then in the extras have Maila tell her story. Done deal, nothing else required. Thats the way I see it. I was glad to hear Maila's story as she died not long after this film was produced.
