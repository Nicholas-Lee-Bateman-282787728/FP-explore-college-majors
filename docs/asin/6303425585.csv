I was 9 and nothing could have prepared me for the treat I was about to see! ""Willard"" is the story of a social outcast who has a crazy mother, a total creep of a boss, and no friends. He finds some rats and becomes close to them instead. Ben and Socrates (the white rat) are the standouts. Willard (Bruce Davidson) befriends his furry pals and teaches them lots of tricks. Everything's great until Willard takes Ben and Socrates to work with him. He hides them, but they are discovered. Willard's creepy boss (Ernest Borgnine) kills Socrates. That's when things get ugly! Willard unleashes his rodent horde on his boss, telling them to ""Tear him up!"". It's all downhill from there, as Willard goes increasingly insane, and Ben rises to turn the rats against him. The end is great and spawned the sequel ""Ben"".

373892,A3673NBQVA4J2M,6303425585,"Daniel Hayes ""D.R. Hayes""","[1, 22]","However, there's alot in this movie that annoys me. I know it's helped me to develop a fear of all mice and rats alike. I also know that the secratary of this movie played by Joan Shawnabe has a uncanny knack to shrink a guy's testicles; that's right folks just make you feel so bad about yourself that your once proud pair are now shrunken heads between your legs.  You know those type of women gentlemen; we've all had them cross our paths at one time or another. Those who seem to be rather uncaring towards anyone who crosses thier path unless it's to help them succeed. Meaning poor Willard is nothing but a eunuch to her, a leper, and anything else you want to consider. She wears those dresses that show off her curves that makes you want to grab her close, and wet her dress with semen, but don't go there she's not worthy of your knowing her. She's not worthy of being a human, but since we live under grace it was shown to her here. Yes Ernest Borgnine deserved to be killed by Ben and Socrates, and so did the people who mocked and laughed at Willard, so WHY WAS SHE SPARED?!!!!! She deserved to die also, to feel the rats cover her face in turds, the claws cutting her face up, and her hair being chewed up, making her cry, and do many other bodily functions. This is some rather gory stuff isn't it? well let's face it folks as I said earlier we've all had this kind of girl/woman cross our path at one time or another, and this is a bull session to get it out what we would like to have happen to them because it wasn't done in this movie. Willard you have to pity him at times here because of what he had gone through with taking over of his father's company, and being demoted to almost a janitor, and his mother is not faring any better as she's having a mental breakdown from it all. I do feel that Willard had something going for him with Sondra Locke as his main squeeze in this movie. That's like the most beautiful girl falling in love with the toadboy in school, and that's where Willard made his mistake. You see Willard forgot to give credit to the rats. Mind you since he was considering marriage to Sondra he couldn't keep them, but he at least could've set them free instead of trying to drown them, but then again Willard was rather prideful because Sondra fell in love with him for himself, and not because he had rats that would devour all thier enemies. This is not fluff, but it's not all that great either. I don't plan on watching this ever again, and why I'm here is to tell everyone how I feel about the secratary. She's hot, but don't play with fire, and that's the same message of this movie.",2,This was a disturbing movie that was pretty much the forerunner of gore movies,1158796800,"09 21, 2006",2006,2631,"['However', 'alot', 'movie', 'know', 'helped', 'develop', 'fear', 'mice', 'rats', 'alike', 'also', 'know', 'secratary', 'movie', 'played', 'Joan', 'Shawnabe', 'uncanny', 'knack', 'shrink', 'guy', 'testicles', 'right', 'folks', 'just', 'make', 'feel', 'so', 'bad', 'once', 'proud', 'pair', 'are', 'now', 'shrunken', 'heads', 'legs', 'know', 'type', 'women', 'gentlemen', ""'ve"", 'had', 'cross', 'paths', 'one', 'time', 'who', 'seem', 'be', 'rather', 'uncaring', 'towards', 'anyone', 'who', 'thier', 'path', 'help', 'succeed', 'Meaning', 'poor', 'Willard', 'nothing', 'eunuch', 'leper', 'anything', 'else', 'want', 'consider', 'dresses', 'show', 'curves', 'want', 'grab', 'close', 'wet', 'dress', 'semen', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'there', 'not', 'worthy', 'knowing', 'not', 'worthy', 'being', 'human', 'live', 'grace', 'was', 'shown', 'here', 'Yes', 'Ernest', 'Borgnine', 'deserved', 'be', 'killed', 'Ben', 'Socrates', 'so', 'did', 'people', 'who', 'mocked', 'laughed', 'Willard', 'so', 'WHY', 'WAS', 'SHE', 'SPARED', 'deserved', 'die', 'also', 'feel', 'rats', 'cover', 'face', 'turds', 'claws', 'cutting', 'face', 'up', 'hair', 'being', 'chewed', 'up', 'making', 'cry', 'do', 'many', 'other', 'bodily', 'functions', 'rather', 'gory', 'stuff', ""n't"", 'well', 'let', 'face', 'said', 'earlier', ""'ve"", 'had', 'kind', 'girl/woman', 'cross', 'path', 'one', 'time', 'bull', 'session', 'get', 'out', 'what', 'would', 'like', 'have', 'happen', 'was', ""n't"", 'done', 'movie', 'Willard', 'have', 'pity', 'times', 'here', 'what', 'had', 'gone', 'taking', 'father', 'company', 'being', 'demoted', 'almost', 'janitor', 'mother', 'not', 'faring', 'better', 'having', 'mental', 'breakdown', 'do', 'feel', 'Willard', 'had', 'something', 'going', 'Sondra', 'Locke', 'main', 'squeeze', 'movie', 'most', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'falling', 'love', 'toadboy', 'school', 'where', 'Willard', 'made', 'mistake', 'see', 'Willard', 'forgot', 'give', 'credit', 'rats', 'Mind', 'was', 'considering', 'marriage', 'Sondra', 'could', ""n't"", 'keep', 'least', 'could', ""'ve"", 'set', 'free', 'instead', 'trying', 'drown', 'then', 'again', 'Willard', 'was', 'rather', 'prideful', 'Sondra', 'fell', 'love', 'not', 'had', 'rats', 'would', 'devour', 'thier', 'enemies', 'not', 'fluff', 'not', 'great', 'do', ""n't"", 'plan', 'watching', 'ever', 'again', 'why', ""'m"", 'here', 'tell', 'everyone', 'how', 'feel', 'secratary', 'hot', 'do', ""n't"", 'play', 'fire', 'same', 'message', 'movie']",Willard VHS

373896,A2WJ6061P5853S,6303425585,Kathryn Tsai,"[0, 0]","The caveat first.  The picture image is not as sharp and clear as it should be and has the look of being a copy of a copy, but it is still watchable.  The PAL region 2 format played just fine on my DVD player that accepts all regions.Rat-themed movies too often go for pure gore or totally silly stories. ""Willard"" does neither.Bruce Davison, Elsa Lanchester, Ernest Borgnine and Sondra Locke give good performances as one might expect from actors of their competence and standing.The rats, trained by Moe and Nora Di Sesso, are not exaggerated nor are they computer-generated.  They are the domestic variety of course, and any viewers who have pet rats will find Socrates, Ben and their many friends and family far more adorable than frightening.Unlike too many ""horror"" movies with rats or other animals, this movie is under-stated rather than trying to be ""in-your-face"".  To all appearances Willard is a normal, reasonably good-looking young man who has found himself in a frustrating and angering situation. Everything else on the surface seems normal as well.  His mother is both dependent and whiny, but not weird.  The house that plays an important part in the story is huge, old and somewhat decrepit, but it is not haunted or filled with outrageous decor. The other characters are also within the bounds of normal, even the somewhat overbearing neighbor Charlotte who tries to befriend Willard.Willard, pretty much friendless, feckless and believing himself to be a failure, nevertheless finds success in training the rats that show up on his property.  Except for his feelings for Socrates he is, however, often ambivalent about the rest of the rats and especially about Ben.  Why this is we never exactly find out, but his ambivalence towards Ben is the fateful turn that leads to the climax of the story.  I shan't dwell on the details of the story since I am assuming that most people interested in the movie are already familiar with them.It is good to find a DVD version of this classic movie and I am hoping that eventually a more clear ""remastered"" version will become available.",5,"With one small caveat ""Willard"" is still a winner",1377129600,"08 22, 2013",2013,2097,"['caveat', 'first', 'picture', 'image', 'not', 'sharp', 'clear', 'should', 'be', 'look', 'being', 'copy', 'copy', 'still', 'watchable', 'PAL', 'region', '2', 'format', 'played', 'just', 'fine', 'DVD', 'player', 'regions.Rat-themed', 'movies', 'too', 'often', 'go', 'pure', 'gore', 'totally', 'silly', 'stories', 'Willard', 'neither.Bruce', 'Davison', 'Elsa', 'Lanchester', 'Ernest', 'Borgnine', 'Sondra', 'Locke', 'give', 'good', 'performances', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'actors', 'competence', 'standing.The', 'rats', 'trained', 'Moe', 'Nora', 'Di', 'Sesso', 'are', 'not', 'exaggerated', 'are', 'computer-generated', 'are', 'domestic', 'variety', 'course', 'viewers', 'who', 'have', 'pet', 'rats', 'will', 'find', 'Socrates', 'Ben', 'many', 'friends', 'family', 'far', 'more', 'adorable', 'frightening.Unlike', 'too', 'many', 'horror', 'movies', 'rats', 'other', 'animals', 'movie', 'under-stated', 'rather', 'trying', 'be', 'in-your-face', 'appearances', 'Willard', 'normal', 'reasonably', 'good-looking', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'found', 'frustrating', 'angering', 'situation', 'Everything', 'else', 'surface', 'normal', 'as', 'well', 'mother', 'dependent', 'whiny', 'not', 'weird', 'house', 'important', 'part', 'story', 'huge', 'old', 'somewhat', 'decrepit', 'not', 'haunted', 'filled', 'outrageous', 'decor', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'also', 'bounds', 'normal', 'even', 'somewhat', 'overbearing', 'neighbor', 'Charlotte', 'who', 'befriend', 'Willard.Willard', 'pretty', 'much', 'friendless', 'feckless', 'believing', 'be', 'failure', 'nevertheless', 'success', 'training', 'rats', 'show', 'up', 'property', 'feelings', 'Socrates', 'however', 'often', 'ambivalent', 'rest', 'rats', 'especially', 'Ben', 'Why', 'never', 'exactly', 'find', 'out', 'ambivalence', 'towards', 'Ben', 'fateful', 'turn', 'climax', 'story', 'sha', ""n't"", 'dwell', 'details', 'story', 'am', 'assuming', 'most', 'people', 'interested', 'movie', 'are', 'already', 'familiar', 'them.It', 'good', 'find', 'DVD', 'version', 'classic', 'movie', 'am', 'hoping', 'eventually', 'more', 'clear', 'remastered', 'version', 'will', 'become', 'available']",Willard VHS
373897,A2NJO6YE954DBH,6303425585,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[19, 22]","""Willard"" is not so much a great horror film as it is a [crude] film.  If you are talking about a great horror film where masses of creatures attack humans than go check out Alfred Hitchcock's ""The Birds.""  With this 1971 film from director Daniel Man we are talking [scaring one with] a whole bunch of rats.  The twist here is that these rats have their own Pied Piper in the person of social misfit, Willard Stiles (Bruce Davidson).  The only friends poor Willard has in this world are his four-legged little friends, including his two favorites, Ben and Socrates, who he starts training to obey his every whim.  Eventually he decides that his boss, Al Martin (Ernest Borgnine), needs to be taught a lesson in what ends up being one of the more memorable scenes by the former Academy Award winning actor.  Willard even finds love in the figure of Joan (Sondra Locke).  Unfortunately, his rat friends do not like being neglected.This is an old fashioned film, which means these rats were actually trained by Moe and Nora Di Sesso to do thinks like walk planks and chew on someone's face.  No computer generated effects for this film.  But then just the idea of a horde of rats descending on a human being should be enough to send you cowering.  Final Notes: Willard's mom is played by Elsa Lanchester, the original ""Bride of Frankenstein.""  ""Willard"" was followed by the sequel ""Ben,"" with its infamous title song sung by Michael Jackson.
