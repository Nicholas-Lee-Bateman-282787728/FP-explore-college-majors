But he was never funnier or more natural on screen than when played laid-back brawling trucker and straight man to Clyde the orangutan.  Eastwood's Phillip Beddoe is on a search for his lost love (Sandra Locke) and he gets into all kinds of trouble at various stops on the road.  That's about it for plot.  But somehow it all works.  Like a Laurel & Hardy movie but here it's Phil & Clyde.  And really, they are both monkeys!  And Clyde's the smarter one.I happened to see Eastwood and then real-life girlfriend Locke in a Sherman Oaks Hughes market one Sunday morning.  He was pushing a squeaky shopping cart and stopped to pick out some cucumbers.  Locke berated him on his choice, put them back and carefully examined several replacements that apparently better fit her culinary requirements.  He patiently listened to her verbose lecture.  I felt sorry for him.  When she was finally finished, he hung his head and ambled off pushing his skidding cart.  No one was around, but I turned my face away in shame and sympathy.  The movie was killed by the critics but was a huge success at the box office - as it deserved.  Still funny, it spawned a less funny sequel.
