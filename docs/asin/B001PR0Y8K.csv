1229532,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B001PR0Y8K,Acute Observer,"[0, 1]","Nothing But the Truth, 2009 filmThe film begins at an outdoor political rally when shots are fired and President Lyman is wounded. The news reports say Venezuela was responsible, so it is attacked and invaded. Two women are riding in a school bus. ""You're a tattletale!"" [Don't be a squealer?] Editors of a newspaper sit around a table to discuss a news story that could bring down the president. Who is the source? Erica denies being a CIA agent, the newspapers are trying to get at her husband, who wrote a book critical of President Lyman. Who squealed? ""This changes everything."" Reporter Rachel is taken in for questioning and threatened with jail unless she names her source. Did the President lie to start a war? Does a reporter have a right to protect a source? [It depends.] Erica visits Rachel to tell what happened. Rachel says nothing to her, or the Grand Jury. She is threatened with ""contempt of court"" for not answering questions.Erica is asked to stay away from school because of this controversy. Rachel gets a summons to appear in court. Can her lawyer Burnside protect her? The judge directs Rachel to name her source or be sent to jail! Her husband and son visit her in jail. The Special Prosecutor will investigate Erica's co-workers too. Is Rachel's newspaper guilty as an ""enabler""? Erica herself falls under suspicion. ""How dare you!"" She is threatened. We see Rachel's life in prison, her family pictures are contraband and she is sent to ""the hole"". Her newspaper plans an interview for television where Rachel talks about he experiences. If the facts in the story are true does the motive of the source matter? [It depends.] Rachel keeps her secret yet. Gossip journalists are not in danger because their trivia isn't important. [Is this why news programs on TV have decayed?]Lawyer Burnside lunches alone and sees Rachel's husband there with a friend. ""Choices have consequences."" A lone gunman approaches Erica and fires two shots. [Senseless violence, or a way to silence a witness?] Rachel is offered a ""blanket waiver"" and go free if she names her source in the Administration. ""The weather has changed."" The corporate media is no longer respected. The knock on the door has surprising news: Rachel's source will testify what he told her: ""Its common knowledge."" But he only provided corroboration. Rachel's torment is increased by her knowledge of Ray's behavior. Then she is attacked and severely beaten by a new inmate. [Was this done in an attempt to break her?] The Supreme Court will take her appeal. Is government power too pervasive? This attacks the Freedom of the Press and the accountability of the government to the people. Does the government fear its citizens? The Supreme Court rules against Rachel, but the lower court judge decides to free Rachel. The Prosecutor says he isn't responsible for this tragedy, he was only following orders.There is a new shock: the Prosecutor filed escalated criminal charges! Will she talk now that she has lost her son and her husband? There is a shocking ending when they reveal Rachel's source and the reason for her adamant silence. This movie was ""inspired by actual events ... does not depict any actual people or events"". This drama shows how art has improved upon reality for its political conflicts. Erica's husband left the Administration to write a book criticizing its policies. The exposure of Erica was petty revenge. [No mention of ties between top editors and political figures.]Our Republic existed for over two hundred years before a new law was passed that made telling the truth about a government employee a crime. How did we manage to survive as a tiny country with Freedom of the Press? This movie subtly points out the errors of that 1982 law. Shouldn't it be repealed? Was it ever wise and just? It seems to prove the government needs to be more accountable to the citizens. Note how a lowly reporter suffers, but a Big Corporation is scarcely touched. That is an unreported scandal in this story. The movie seems a bit long, its fault is the lack of a happy ending that usually makes a successful movie.",5,Why We Need Freedom of the Press,1282435200,"08 22, 2010",2010,4109,"['Nothing', 'Truth', '2009', 'filmThe', 'film', 'outdoor', 'political', 'rally', 'when', 'shots', 'are', 'fired', 'President', 'Lyman', 'wounded', 'news', 'reports', 'say', 'Venezuela', 'was', 'responsible', 'attacked', 'invaded', 'Two', 'women', 'are', 'riding', 'school', 'bus', ""'re"", 'tattletale', '[', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'squealer', ']', 'Editors', 'newspaper', 'sit', 'table', 'discuss', 'news', 'story', 'could', 'bring', 'down', 'president', 'Who', 'source', 'Erica', 'being', 'CIA', 'agent', 'newspapers', 'are', 'trying', 'get', 'husband', 'who', 'wrote', 'book', 'critical', 'President', 'Lyman', 'Who', 'squealed', 'everything', 'Reporter', 'Rachel', 'taken', 'questioning', 'threatened', 'jail', 'source', 'Did', 'President', 'lie', 'start', 'war', 'reporter', 'have', 'right', 'protect', 'source', '[', ']', 'Erica', 'visits', 'Rachel', 'tell', 'what', 'happened', 'Rachel', 'nothing', 'Grand', 'Jury', 'threatened', 'contempt', 'court', 'not', 'answering', 'questions.Erica', 'asked', 'stay', 'away', 'school', 'controversy', 'Rachel', 'summons', 'appear', 'court', 'Can', 'lawyer', 'Burnside', 'protect', 'judge', 'Rachel', 'name', 'source', 'be', 'sent', 'jail', 'husband', 'son', 'visit', 'jail', 'Special', 'Prosecutor', 'will', 'investigate', 'Erica', 'co-workers', 'too', 'Rachel', 'newspaper', 'guilty', 'enabler', 'Erica', 'suspicion', 'How', 'dare', 'threatened', 'see', 'Rachel', 'life', 'prison', 'family', 'pictures', 'are', 'contraband', 'sent', 'hole', 'newspaper', 'interview', 'television', 'where', 'Rachel', 'facts', 'story', 'are', 'true', 'motive', 'source', 'matter', ']', 'Rachel', 'secret', 'yet', 'Gossip', 'journalists', 'are', 'not', 'danger', 'trivia', ""n't"", 'important', '[', 'why', 'news', 'programs', 'TV', 'have', 'decayed', ']', 'Lawyer', 'Burnside', 'alone', 'Rachel', 'husband', 'there', 'friend', 'Choices', 'have', 'consequences', 'lone', 'gunman', 'Erica', 'fires', 'two', 'shots', '[', 'Senseless', 'violence', 'way', 'silence', 'witness', ']', 'Rachel', 'offered', 'blanket', 'waiver', 'go', 'free', 'source', 'Administration', 'weather', 'changed', 'corporate', 'media', 'longer', 'respected', 'knock', 'door', 'surprising', 'news', 'Rachel', 'source', 'will', 'testify', 'what', 'told', 'common', 'knowledge', 'only', 'provided', 'corroboration', 'Rachel', 'torment', 'increased', 'knowledge', 'Ray', 'behavior', 'Then', 'attacked', 'severely', 'beaten', 'new', 'inmate', '[', 'Was', 'done', 'attempt', 'break', ']', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'will', 'take', 'appeal', 'government', 'power', 'too', 'pervasive', 'Freedom', 'Press', 'accountability', 'government', 'people', 'government', 'fear', 'citizens', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'rules', 'Rachel', 'lower', 'court', 'judge', 'free', 'Rachel', 'Prosecutor', ""n't"", 'responsible', 'tragedy', 'was', 'only', 'following', 'orders.There', 'new', 'shock', 'Prosecutor', 'filed', 'escalated', 'criminal', 'charges', 'Will', 'talk', 'now', 'lost', 'son', 'husband', 'shocking', 'ending', 'when', 'reveal', 'Rachel', 'source', 'reason', 'adamant', 'silence', 'movie', 'was', 'inspired', 'actual', 'events', 'not', 'depict', 'actual', 'people', 'events', 'drama', 'how', 'art', 'improved', 'reality', 'political', 'conflicts', 'Erica', 'husband', 'left', 'Administration', 'write', 'book', 'criticizing', 'policies', 'exposure', 'Erica', 'was', 'petty', 'revenge', 'mention', 'ties', 'top', 'editors', 'political', 'figures', ']', 'Republic', 'existed', 'two', 'hundred', 'years', 'new', 'law', 'was', 'passed', 'made', 'telling', 'truth', 'government', 'employee', 'crime', 'How', 'did', 'manage', 'survive', 'tiny', 'country', 'Freedom', 'Press', 'movie', 'subtly', 'out', 'errors', '1982', 'law', 'Should', ""n't"", 'be', 'repealed', 'ever', 'wise', 'just', 'prove', 'government', 'be', 'more', 'accountable', 'citizens', 'Note', 'how', 'lowly', 'reporter', 'suffers', 'Big', 'Corporation', 'scarcely', 'touched', 'unreported', 'scandal', 'story', 'movie', 'bit', 'long', 'fault', 'lack', 'happy', 'ending', 'usually', 'successful', 'movie']",Nothing But the Truth

1229534,AGEIT17HENDIS,B001PR0Y8K,Alfred Johnson,"[2, 4]","In the normal course of my work in this space I don't generally review current commercial films, except when they provide some kind of political or social comment that is in line with my aims. Or I have an ax to grind. The latter turns out to be the case here. The plot of this film revolves around a First Amendment freedom of the press question of a high profile, Type-A newspaper women protecting a source at least that is the way it unfolds, although it is done in a somewhat ham-handed and obviously benignly liberal way.On the face of it, a film about the praiseworthy efforts of a doggedly determined print reporter bound, seemingly beyond reason, to protect her source of knowledge about why the President of the United States called in a patently erroneous retaliatory strike on Venezuela (you can see where the problem is already, I assume) seem to be tailor -made for praise from this reviewer. Except everything is wrong here. That includes everything, from the source the reporter is protecting to her refusal to divulge her source under very trying circumstances, to say the least, (I won't give that source up here either. I am not tattle-tale and moreover that revelation provided the only real twist in this whole sorry plot line.) to the nasty twist and turns of the federal special prosecutor who is trying to nail her in the interest of ""national security"".Don't get me wrong, or at only get me wrong a little. We better fight tooth and nail to maintain a free press and other forms of expression against governmental interference. But one must pick and choose one's battles. Off of this plot line and off the moral dilemmas the reporter willingly placed herself in there is certainly a question about her political acumen, to say nothing of her common sense.But the real issue here, aside from the liberal bend of putting up the good fight to maintain the free press that drives the film, is that the vaunted ""forth estate"", of late,  has been pretty sorry in real life when it comes to opposing the American government's propaganda lines. A medium that was asleep at the wheel, in many cases willingly so, during the lead up to the Bush portion of the Iraq War, and for a long time after, is hardly worthy, as the people associated with this production seem to think, of positive treatment, even when one could admire the tenacity if not the common sense of the reporter in this drama. While we desperately need to protect free expression this film did not add much to our real life knowledge about how to defend it. Certainly not the way it played out in this film, that is for sure.",3,"Nothing But The Truth, Maybe",1248566400,"07 26, 2009",2009,2606,"['normal', 'course', 'work', 'space', 'do', ""n't"", 'generally', 'review', 'current', 'commercial', 'films', 'when', 'provide', 'kind', 'political', 'social', 'comment', 'line', 'aims', 'have', 'ax', 'grind', 'latter', 'out', 'be', 'case', 'here', 'plot', 'film', 'First', 'Amendment', 'freedom', 'press', 'question', 'high', 'profile', 'Type-A', 'newspaper', 'women', 'protecting', 'source', 'least', 'way', 'done', 'somewhat', 'ham-handed', 'obviously', 'benignly', 'liberal', 'face', 'film', 'praiseworthy', 'efforts', 'doggedly', 'determined', 'print', 'reporter', 'bound', 'seemingly', 'reason', 'protect', 'source', 'knowledge', 'why', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'called', 'patently', 'erroneous', 'retaliatory', 'strike', 'Venezuela', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'problem', 'already', 'assume', 'seem', 'be', 'tailor', '-made', 'praise', 'reviewer', 'everything', 'wrong', 'here', 'everything', 'source', 'reporter', 'protecting', 'refusal', 'divulge', 'source', 'very', 'trying', 'circumstances', 'say', 'least', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'source', 'up', 'here', 'either', 'am', 'not', 'tattle-tale', 'moreover', 'revelation', 'provided', 'only', 'real', 'twist', 'whole', 'sorry', 'plot', 'line', 'nasty', 'twist', 'turns', 'federal', 'special', 'prosecutor', 'who', 'trying', 'nail', 'interest', 'national', 'security', '.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'only', 'get', 'wrong', 'little', 'better', 'fight', 'tooth', 'nail', 'maintain', 'free', 'press', 'other', 'forms', 'expression', 'governmental', 'interference', 'one', 'must', 'pick', 'choose', 'one', 'battles', 'plot', 'line', 'moral', 'dilemmas', 'reporter', 'willingly', 'placed', 'certainly', 'question', 'political', 'acumen', 'say', 'nothing', 'common', 'sense.But', 'real', 'issue', 'here', 'aside', 'liberal', 'bend', 'putting', 'up', 'good', 'fight', 'maintain', 'free', 'press', 'film', 'vaunted', 'forth', 'estate', 'late', 'been', 'pretty', 'sorry', 'real', 'life', 'when', 'opposing', 'American', 'government', 'propaganda', 'lines', 'medium', 'was', 'asleep', 'wheel', 'many', 'cases', 'willingly', 'so', 'lead', 'up', 'Bush', 'portion', 'Iraq', 'War', 'long', 'time', 'hardly', 'worthy', 'people', 'associated', 'production', 'seem', 'think', 'positive', 'treatment', 'even', 'when', 'one', 'could', 'admire', 'tenacity', 'not', 'common', 'sense', 'reporter', 'drama', 'desperately', 'need', 'protect', 'free', 'expression', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'add', 'much', 'real', 'life', 'knowledge', 'how', 'defend', 'Certainly', 'not', 'way', 'played', 'out', 'film', 'sure']",Nothing But the Truth

1229542,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B001PR0Y8K,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[0, 0]","This film is much better than I ever imagined. I'm surprised it hasn't gotten a bit more buzz or positive looks. The story is compelling, based on true events but is a work of fiction. The acting is surprisingly good, that's expected from Kate Beckinsale; but Matt Dillon turns in one of his better performances. David Schwimmer has finally lost the whole Friends aura. Alan Alda is sadly still playing Alan Alda. Vera Farmiga is one of the surprises.There's no need to understand or even have heard about the case this film is based on. The director did a perfectly wonderful job at making the story line compelling and easy to follow without prior knowledge (and I have none). This is a decent thriller / mystery in the not as convluted Burn After Reading, or West Wing molds.The story is simple and fairly linear. The film opens with the president being shot and the US government blaming Venezula for the attempted assaniation. Rachel Armstrong (Kate Beckinsale) publishes a story that exposes a CIA agent, Erica Van Doren (Vera Farmiga). A special prosecutor is appointed, (Matt Dillon), to find her source. Rachel refuses and is put in jail. The meat and potatoes of the story is how she ends up in jail, her time there and then the resolution of the story. Many things happen along the way, and none should be revealed. There is a wonderful surprise ending to the film.Production wise this is fairly well done. In fact film values is what drags this film down a star. That darn annoying roving random no reason camera motion nonsense is heavy duty here. Editing was fairly well done, pacing was about right. The film is right length at almost 2 hours. Shots are reasonably in focus. Sound was well recorded, dialog is perfectly clear.The film is rated R for one reason only, strong language (about 50 f bombs that weren't really necessary). In fact this is such a good morality tale, I really wish this had gotten a PG-13. There was a congugal visit between Rachel and her husband Ray.

1229543,A1FJ4WAOIDPEF4,B001PR0Y8K,David J. Brown,"[3, 5]","I love, LOVED, this film!!!  Not only is it acted to perfection, but it's topical while still being a work of fiction.  The acting is all top notch.  Special notices must be given to Kate Beckinsale(who should be doing less Underworlds and Van Helsings and more like this), Vera Famiga and Alan Alda.  Matt Dillon is very good but his part is much smaller campared to the rest of the cast and their part to play in the drama.Basically, we get two trains of thought on this film.  A reporter won't indentify her source even though the source is in the C.I.A. and lead to revealing another C.I.A. agent(Famiga).  She refuses to give up her source, but the goverment lawyer(Dillon) says its a matter of national security that she does, and it is.  A leak in the C.I.A. is nothing to look blindly at.  This a true breach of our national security and in the times we're living in its a real deal matter.  She keeps to her word and ends up in jail for her journalistic integrity but the goverment keeps to their and punishes her for it.Both sides have a point and the film goes to painstaking lengths to make sure the audience sees it both ways.  There's no villain in the film.  Each has their eithics and codes, and each sticks to them honorably.  It's frustrating when a film gives you no easy outs.  The simple-minded among viewers will see the government as the bad guys or the reporter as the unpatriotic, commie traitor, but the layers of grey strewn throughout the film, like in REAL LIFE, is thick and intriguing.Whatever side you take, the film gives closure to both points of views.  Everyone gets punished and brought to task.  There's no easy way out.The film is beautifully written, acted and especially directed.  This is one that slipped under the radar.  Why bother?  We wouldn't want our art to reflect anything that happens in the real world, in our current history.  We have to hide our heads in the sand and pretend that we're all effected equally by the horrors that face our modern world.  Why see relevant films anymore?  Hell, there's dat one about the dude with the metal claws, so why bother?  Of course if you're left you'll see the film one way, and the same goes for the finatical right, but this is a film for the independent or moderate.  It doesn't require domatic cult fellowship of a political party to get into.  It doesn't cater to anyone in either party.The film has one minor flaw that involves a final twist in the third act.  I didn't know what to think about it, and it just seemed like it was tacked on to justify the reporter ever so slightly.  But, you check it out and decide for yourself.",5,"AAAGGHH!

1229544,A2Q42ON9CEHR4O,B001PR0Y8K,David R. Eastwood,"[2, 6]","Just as all sorts of very different animals--such as bats, kangaroos, monkeys, alligators, seals, cattle, mice, etc.--have brains, eyes, ears, teeth, backbones, ribs, shoulders, hips, hearts, lungs, etc. as their similar components, any writer (or any two or more writers) can use basically one group of component parts to accomplish many different purposes or effects. For instance, take a good king, his murderous brother, and the good king's son--one writer makes HAMLET, and another makes THE LION KING. A third writer can change the mix a tiny bit--and come up with MADAGASCAR: ESCAPE 2 AFRICA.NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH takes some of the components of the real-life story of outed CIA agent Valerie Plame, her husband Joseph Wilson, and Judith Miller (the NY TIMES reporter who was jailed for not revealing her source)--and turns them inside out (in his commentary, Rod Lurie, an ex-newspaperman and the writer-director, says, ""I wanted to put in the character of a reporter . . . somebody that was, in fact, RIGHT about the story she was reporting on, and so, from almost every point of view, was NOT Judith Miller""). The film focuses on a reporter (Kate Beckinsale) who publishes an article revealing that the White House attacked a foreign country despite a CIA agent's report that that country had nothing to do with an attempt on the U.S. president's life. What follows is a battle to learn who the reporter's sources were. Matt Dillon (special prosecutor) tries to squeeze the information out of the reporter by throwing her in prison; Alan Alda (her defense attorney) is an ineffectual, pathetic fop most of the time. Months pass, and the case goes to the Supreme Court, where the expected decision is rendered. And Dillon's character (apparently vindictive because he has totally failed to learn her main source) sees to it that more punishment follows--tangentially providing a rather ugly view of ""our"" government. Almost as ugly is the collapse of the reporter's marriage: within just a few months of her being sent to prison, all her husband can focus on is finding another woman to have sex with.And what, at the end, does this all add up to? This film, judging by the way its components have been edited and cut, merely turns out to have been a kind of Puzzle for us viewers to solve if we can. This means it is in the same category as a wit-twister like the film THE LAST OF SHEILA. Essentially, the film's punch-line issue becomes ""Can YOU figure out who the reporter's main source was?"" because the final scene at last reveals/confirms WHO that person was. (Most Agatha Christie mystery readers, among others, can figure this out about halfway through, but the sequencing of the components turns it into the film's main point.)Given its components, which could have been rearranged/re-edited to create a different impact, this COULD have been a much better film. For instance, the question of ""who"" could have been disclosed early, and the film could then have been a serious work like ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN (starring Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman) or THE VERDICT (starring Paul Newman) or SYRIANA (starring George Clooney). It could then have focused on complex issues like facets of the First Amendment (freedom of the press) vs. national security concerns--or on how the White House repeatedly has lied to us and to Congress about bogus national security concerns in order to justify all sorts of illegal and destructive things (long before we had GWB, there were LBJ and RMN). Could this kind of change have been made? Quite easily: the DVD includes two deleted scenes that could only have been in just such an alternative ending--or something very close to it.Sadly most of the actors were wasted in this film. Vera Farmiga (the Plame figure) did the most plausible acting  job but was ""removed"" from the film in an unpleasant way. Do I have other objections? Well, one would be the opening scene in which the president is shot: no attempt is made to examine his wound and stop his bleeding. Another would be a small slip of the tongue 32 minutes into the film where a lawyer says ""Fifth Amendment issues"" when he clearly meant to say ""First Amendment issues"" (this should have been caught and redubbed). Further, considering how polarized our society is nowadays, quite implausibly this film shows no individuals or groups or organizations protesting against or fighting against the injustices that are occurring.Not incidentally, Rod Lurie, as director, did make the RIGHT decision to play down the glamourous looks of Kate Beckinsale--and to delete a nude shower scene of hers which would totally have changed the nature of the whole film. And, no, it is NOT included among the deleted scenes; it is merely mentioned during his detailed commentary.",3,THIS FILM AIMS LOW--AND HITS WHAT IT AIMS AT,1255219200,"10 11,

Get it at Amazon.]The men are real scum in this one.  David Schwimmer gets to play a guy who basically gives up on his heroic wife while Matt Dillon gets to play a blood-thirsty prosecutor bent on furthering his career whatever the human cost.  Even Alan Alda (minus a fine little speech before the Supreme Court) gets to basically fail in defending his client.His client is Rachel Armstrong (Kate Beckinsale) a journalist who finds herself in contempt of court for not revealing her source for a story on the outing of a CIA agent.  (Shades of the Judith Miller/Valerie Plame Wilson case.)  Here instead of the Iraq war we have an assignation attempt on the President supposedly by somebody in Venezuela after which the US takes some military action.  Rachel ends up in jail and we get to see her suffer all the deprivations of being jail, getting beaten up, estranged from her son and her husband, who betrays her.  She is doing all this to protect a source, and a kind of journalistic honor code.  David Swimmer's character isn't interested in journalist honor codes.  He is displeased that she cares more about protecting her source than in being with him and her son.Clearly this is a Belt Way story told as a woman's POV flick.  It is engaging and it moves right along.  It is sharp, just a tad short of slick.  We cannot help but identify with Kate Beckinsale's character.  And when we find out at the very, very end whom she is protecting we understand.  It is a nice twist, one of the cleverest I've seen in movies in quite a while.  The end is just perfect.I was about to write that ""every soccer mom and indeed every mom will identify with Kate Beckinsale's character"" but actually not all of them will.

1229547,AHPV4F8IVSC39,B001PR0Y8K,"Douglas B. Moran ""Computer+History/Politics""","[7, 12]","Warning: When reading reviews of this movie, be aware that someone such as me who knows/remembers details of Judith Miller/Valerie Plame Wilson events may well have very different interpretation of, and reaction to, this movie than those who don't.-- Review of movie as advertised --The movie is advertised as a issue-oriented thriller. It is neither of those.  Its treatment of the issue of reporters-protecting-their-sources goes no further than mouthing the well-worn phrases.  A key plot point depends upon getting a basic fact of this issue wrong.  The movie is also advertised as inspired by the Miller/Wilson events, but only a few superficial details are present: The reporter was jailed for refusing to reveal a source and the person harmed by an irresponsible press was a spy, both of which have happened multiple times.  Absent are the many aspects of the Miller/Wilson case that made it unusual and interesting.The end of the story is ""shocking"", as in ""shockingly bad.""  It is a ""BS"" moment of such magnitude that it can destroy any preceding positives. [[The remainder of this paragraph dances close to being a spoiler]] The source she went to jail to protect does not qualify as a source, but something closer to a tip or lead, and there never was any expectation of confidentiality by the source, hence no justification for the press-shield claim.  There was also an ambiguity whether the reporter's intent was honorable, or whether she was protecting herself from attack for having used that ""source.""This movie does one interesting thing--flipping the role of good and evil--but it is not fleshed out and may have been unintentional.  Dillon's prosecutor is positioned as the antagonist (evil), but he is the one pursuing the public interest whereas Beckinsale's reporter/protagonist is a step away from being a psychopath (no empathy, no conscience, manipulative, self-involved to the extreme).  Similarly for a range of smaller inconsistencies: They are so underdeveloped that they are likely sloppy plotting rather than an attempt to insert serious ambiguity into the story.  Note: Because the expectations that come with this genre are so strong, this interpretation may occur only to those with strong recollections of Miller/Wilson.-- Review for You-Go-Girl genre --The You-Go-Girl genre has the plucky heroine standing up, and sacrificing, for her principles in the face of great adversity while surrounded by men who fail her. Had this had been marketed as such, and I had watched it nonetheless, I would have given it only 2 or 3 stars relative to that genre.  First and foremost, it is hard to have sympathy for Beckinsale's reporter, much less regard her as a heroine, when her plight is entirely self-inflicted and for selfish reasons.  There is no apparent reason that the _news_ story needed to identify the spy.  That identification was simply sensationalism, profiting both the newspaper and the reporter (career enhancement).Second, while the genre requires a mix of feckless and evil male characters, the ones here are inadequate for their roles.  It is hard to imagine a David Schwimmer character being married to a Kate Beckinsale character. And how can you be disappointed in that character (part of the formula) when he behaves exactly as you would expect from Schwimmer's character on ""Friends""?  The Alan Alda lawyer character is a step away from Denny Crane (William Shatner on ""Boston Legal"").  The bosses at the newspaper and the CIA are forgettable even as you are watching them.  The exception is Matt Dillon, playing against type, whose character comes across as intelligent, dedicated, and decent.Third, as befits this genre, almost all the supporting characters who are strong are women.  While such a range works better as an expository device than having a single such character, the opportunity for each such character to contribute to the atmospherics was diluted below the point of being effective: I noticed but did not feel.---- Divergence from the Judith Miller story ----The more you are familiar with the details of the Valerie Plame Wilson case, the more likely you are to be hostile to the reporter character and to see the missed opportunities in the script.  The remainder of this review is for those who might be interested in such details.The outing of Valerie Plame Wilson didn't just end the career of an extremely valuable intelligence agent, but damaged/destroyed critical networks of assets, reportedly getting many of them killed (especially those in Iraq). Those networks were reported to be focused on nuclear counter-proliferation, that is, countering attempts to get nuclear weapons by rogue states and possibly terrorists.  This detail could have enhanced the conflict between the reporter and the prosecutor characters.Plame Wilson was compromised not as part of getting an important story to the public, but solely to punish or discredit her husband Joe Wilson, who had written an Op-Ed piece to get such a story out.Plame Wilson was identified by columnist Robert Novak.  Reporter Judith Miller's source attempted to get her to participate in the smear, but she didn't write the story. Novak escaped prosecution under the most absurd of explanations. Such a disparity between his and her treatment is obvious fodder for a movie in this genre.For newspapers-as-businesses, Miller was an excellent employee because she got scoops.  However, those scoops were often based upon false information, and favored the Bush-Cheney Administration's agenda.  This was not a simple case of her being gullible--she excluded important contrary information from at least one big story and she withheld from her editors the information that the Administration was pursuing the smear using Plame Wilson.

I, too, did not follow the Plame case but picked this up to view because it just looked interesting.  It was!  I just want to add a couple of points:1.  The reporter should have been able to explain her source without causing damage to the person she got the info from (this was covered very well by another reviewer)and thus not gone to jail and ruined her family.  It does seem she was a little ""short sighted"" to figure this out.  But still, it is what it is and the ending explains it, whether you agree or not.2.  Does anybody actually believe that a ""right-wing wacko"" just drove up and waited for the ex-CIA agent to show up and then whack her?  Did she lose all her training and instincts?  Then this guy drives a half-mile and wrecks his 30 year old car so he can be caught?  Give me a break!  She was hit by the CIA who set up this mental case nut to do the job! Oswald anyone?

I'm not sure why the reviews here tend to be so negative, save the ranting of those who fail to see that this film represents two sides.Kate Beckinsale plays the role of a journalist who writes a story implicating the government's top echelons in declaring an act of war with trumped-up evidence. Matt Dillon plays the prosecutor who pressures her to reveal her source--since that source has violated the law by naming a covert CIA agent, played to great effect by Vera Farmiga. Yes, the plot has some obvious correlations to events of the past few years, which seems to be the thorn in the side of some reviewers, but it gives both sides important things to say. While the film does center around Beckinsale, building sympathy for her, it also gives Dillon's character a chance to stand by his own moral codes to protect his country. The issues of the First and Fifth Amendment are considered here.""Nothing But the Truth"" keeps us hooked by the secret identify of the source that Beckinsale protects with such ferocity. Alan Alda plays her lawyer, while Angela Bassett plays her editor. Though both add layers, it's Beckinsale, Farmiga, and Dillon who drive the story. Beckinsale and Farmiga are strong female characters, both threatened with the losses of marriage and family ties, both feeling persecuted for doing their jobs.I hold dear the power of the written word and the right to speak the truth. I also believe national security is of vital importance, and I like the fact this film honors that as well. However, a government that cannot be held accountable to faulty actions is in a position to abuse its powers--take recent events in Iran, as an example. As a proud American, I want our President to be able to make decisions, in secret, that protect our country. I also want our leaders to be called to account if they violate the law--as in the Watergate case.""Nothing But the Truth"" forces us to consider principles and integrity from the highest levels down to our personal lives. The film does move a bit slowly at times, mainly because Beckinsale's obvious refusal to budge leaves few questions left to be answered, but the twist at the end helps us understand her bullheadedness.The truth here hurts. Beckinsale and Farmiga have a lot to lose, and even Dillon must risk accusations of coldheartedness for standing by his own beliefs. Superb acting all around lifts this movie above many others that have tackled this subject. Those who refuse to weigh both sides of this debate fail to understand the tough decisions that faced America's forefathers.

In many ways it is a horror movie, if the story line of the film 'based on a real incident' examined in such a carefully realized way is unknown to many viewers  Yes, movies are movies and need to alter names and places and events to create a dramatic effect, but the story here is one that needs diligent attention as we continue to re-evaluate the dense and covered shadows that remain from the last administration.An attempted assassination of the President too quickly leads to naming Venezuela as perpetrator and under the guise of 'national security' that country is placed as the target for a possible preemptive war (sound familiar?).  Cover-up begins and an undercover CIA operative is disclosed by a gutsy female reporter whose story is so important that it suggests the possibility of being in line for a Pulitzer Prize. But the government doesn't want the truth to leak and the reporter is eventually jailed and imprisoned for refusing to reveal her source of the story.  The ending of the film is indeed terrifying.The well selected cast includes Kate Beckinsale as the brave reporter, Vera Farminga as the outed CIA operative,  David Schwimmer as Beckinsale's frightened husband, Matt Dillon as the government henchman assigned to get Beckinsale to reveal her source and Alan Alda as the lawyer who supports Beckinsale's stance (his speech before the Supreme Court will be remembered as some of the finest and most gripping writing in years). Others in strong supporting roles include Angela Bassett, Noah Wylie, and Floyd Abrams.Sam Lurie wrote and directed this engrossing film with the good sense to not hammer the audience over the head with the fairly obvious comparisons to the shenanigans of the Bush/Cheney administration, leaving the evidence in plain sight that when the President decides what can and can't  be known to the public - in the name of 'homeland security' - our constitutional rights and even our democratic form of government is at stake.

Along with Kate Beckinsale, David Schwimmer is the supportive husband who supports, but eventually buckles under the pressure of having an imprisoned wife.  Angela Basset as a newspaper's editor in chief who initially shows great support but eventually shows waning interest.  Noah Wyle shows great angst as the newspaper's lawyer, and even calling in a hot-shot, mercenary lawyer, Alan Alda, but eventually succumbs to pressure beyond his expectations.

When Wyle and Alda decay from conceit to confident, to literally choking on their words, the vise-like headlock applied by the strong arm of the law, which in this case is special prosecutor Matt Dillon, is soul crushing.Suspenseful except for a bad ending, this film will have viewers choosing sides early and challenging their own beliefs.  Determining who is right or wrong, or what is just or unfair, is an introspective struggle, but I feel the case is clear cut here.  Regardless of political affiliation, the movie is interesting.--Commentary--Based so close to reality, with a thinly veiled disguise, it's insulting to think that anyone wouldn't realize the movie's true intentions.  If those involved really wanted a Valerie Plame scandal piece, or a hatchet-job on the previous administration's pre-war intelligence, then they should have just named Beckinsale's character Mudith Jiller.  Ultimately, it's the confused politics and journalistic ego that nearly ruins the plot.  Exposing a source is entirely different from revealing matters of national security.  And, trust me, it's VERY difficult for me to root against a Kate Beckinsale character.  When it's journalism versus national security, journalistic integrity absolutely must get trumped every time.  And the stupid part is, if Beckinsale's character had simply revealed her source originally, things would have turned out MUCH better for all involved.The media lovers can cry me a river about their slippery slope argument leading to 1984 dystopian media, because when it comes down to it, divulging secret information to a reporter is a crime, and the person responsible should be held accountable.  Break the law, or aid and abet the law-breaker, and you go to jail.

The CIA agent in question is another Class Mother in their kids' second grade class. In a bitter parallelism, the reporter goes to jail for protecting her source and the agent is hounded out of the Company for probably being the source herself (she's not).Both metaphorically suffer the tortures of the rack.Matt Dillon plays an avenging prosecutor who decides to make an example of Beckinsale. The Judge is utterly unsympathetic, a reflexive law-and-order android. Beckinsale gets tossed in the general population clink (the cleanest GP clink you've ever seen) for not talking. Her paper backs her at first, but their mounting legal bills (Alan Alda plays her frustrated lawyer), their daily $10,000 fine, and the vagaries of the News Cycle leave Beckinsale a Cassandrist Robinson Crusoe, virtually forgotten by everyone.The days pile up. She won't talk. Deals are offered. She won't talk. In a standard chick flick twist, her husband, (the very fey David Schwimmer) cheats on her. She won't talk. She gets severely beaten by a female inmate who steals her bunk. She won't talk. Her cell gets tossed and she goes to the hole for contraband (an apple). She won't talk. Bad things happen outside the jail that affect the case and Beckinsale personally. She won't talk. Her kid hates her because he doesn't understand why she won't just do what they want and come home. She won't talk. The Company puts the squeeze on a few agents who know her. They talk. Beckinsale is released. It's been almost two years.She isn't even out of the jail parking lot when Dillon comes down on her with Federal obstruction of justice charges. In a blink, she's back behind bars---two years in Federal Prison, no time served.This would have been a far, far better film if it just retold the true Valerie Plame story, and if they had dropped the obligatory Soccer Mom routine and the underlying thesis of ""The Establishment Thinks Women Are Weak, They Can't Be Trusted, And This Never Would Have Happened To A Man.""Frankly, all the men in NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH are worthless: Alda can't argue a parking ticket, the Judge can't think for himself, Schwimmer is a philanderer who abandons his wife because (boo hoo) his feelings are hurt, the son is generically angry at Mom for not being there for him (no pride in principle allowed here), the CIA Director is an insinuating sexist slimeball, and Matt Dillon is a stereotyped movie prosecutor, duty-bound, anal-retentive, and heartless---a lawyer and a real son of a b***h. Or is that redundant in our culture? He'd be easier to take if he was torturing Beckinsale for personal gain, like a big promotion Alberto Gonzalez style, but, oh, no, far more frighteningly, he's just a True Believer.It's a worthwhile watch because NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH really underscores how ephemeral our rights as Americans are. Yes, we have a Constitution and a Bill of Rights, but a bunch of ethics-deficient second-tier law school frat boys can reinterpret it all out of existence at will. That's the scariest part.

1229562,A2T049UQONS0OY,B001PR0Y8K,Larry VanDeSande,"[1, 1]","Based on the 2005 case where CIA agent Valerie Plame was exposed by New York Times journalist Judith Miller, ""Nothing But The Truth"" is a compelling political drama about what happens when a journalist in today's world refuses to disclose a source of information for what is perceived to be national security causes. If you've been living in a cave since the Watergate era, you may not know that government power has increased dramatically in the United States since the days of Waco and Ruby Ridge; the increase in that power, as reflected in all levels of American courts, is the main theme of this film.The movies involves a journalist from a fictitious Washington D.C.-based newspaper that attends a party where she learns one of her soccer mom neighbors is a spy for the CIA and has done business for them in South America. The journalist (Kate Beckinsale) writes a story exposing her identity that leads to a morass of misery for herself and the spy (Vera Farmiga).The film focuses on the toll this takes on Beckinsale's character, who is thrown in jail for contempt of court, spends a year there, loses a Supreme Court hearing on her right to maintain source confidentiality, and effectively has her life ruined. In perhaps a little too much drama, it works out even worse for Farmiga's character, who is exposed and hardly protected by the government that secretly employed her, which now believes she is potentially a living security breach.This movie, true to its situation, does not have a happy ending. The final scene itself is shattering and gives perspective to the journalist's decision to ruin her life over the matter. No one triumphs in the film including the government which continues to torment the journalist beyond her year in jail.There is some good acting in the movie; Matt Dillon ably plays the one-dimensional portrait of a government prosecutor intent on finding the traitor that was the journalist's source. Real life lawyer Floyd Abrams, who represented the New York Times in the Miller-Plume case, is credible as the judge managing the journalist's life. Alan Alda is pretty good as her lawyer but the two women in the leading roles wouldn't have been my first choices to play them. Both are a little too pretty and not gritty enough for the situations they are in. But this was a Hollywood production after all.Personally, I was struck dramatically by this film which left me with lingering questions. I worked in state government for years and, whenever I took one of those tests about my beliefs, I ended up being scored a ""statist"" meaning I thought government intervention on things was OK, maybe even better than OK, even though I always thought of myself as a political moderate that voted for persons of both parties. I am also a journalism graduate of a major American university and worked in both the news media and the advertising industry before three decades working in government.This film gave pause to my mixed beliefs on personal liberty and government's ability to aid and my apathy about the world we live in where you are required to remove your shoes at aiports, go through metal detectors at schools, run in the Boston marathon at risk of being bombed, and the resulting power the U.S. government has absorbed in our democracy as a result. Does government have too much power? Is the First Amendment still effectual? Those are questions I asked after watching ""Nothihng But The Truth,"" a topical political drama that transcends its material to suggest the larger political and governmental issues of our society in 2013.",4,An effective political drama based on real life events,1366416000,"04 20, 2013",2013,3576,"['Based', '2005', 'case', 'where', 'CIA', 'agent', 'Valerie', 'Plame', 'was', 'exposed', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'journalist', 'Judith', 'Miller', 'Nothing', 'Truth', 'compelling', 'political', 'drama', 'what', 'when', 'journalist', 'today', 'world', 'disclose', 'source', 'information', 'what', 'perceived', 'be', 'national', 'security', 'causes', ""'ve"", 'been', 'living', 'cave', 'Watergate', 'era', 'may', 'not', 'know', 'government', 'power', 'increased', 'dramatically', 'United', 'States', 'days', 'Waco', 'Ruby', 'Ridge', 'increase', 'power', 'reflected', 'levels', 'American', 'courts', 'main', 'theme', 'film.The', 'movies', 'journalist', 'fictitious', 'Washington', 'D.C.-based', 'newspaper', 'party', 'where', 'one', 'soccer', 'mom', 'neighbors', 'spy', 'CIA', 'done', 'business', 'South', 'America', 'journalist', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'story', 'exposing', 'identity', 'morass', 'misery', 'herself', 'spy', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', '.The', 'film', 'focuses', 'toll', 'Beckinsale', 'character', 'who', 'thrown', 'jail', 'contempt', 'court', 'year', 'there', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'hearing', 'right', 'maintain', 'source', 'confidentiality', 'effectively', 'life', 'ruined', 'perhaps', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'drama', 'out', 'even', 'worse', 'Farmiga', 'character', 'who', 'exposed', 'hardly', 'protected', 'government', 'secretly', 'employed', 'now', 'potentially', 'living', 'security', 'breach.This', 'movie', 'true', 'situation', 'not', 'have', 'happy', 'ending', 'final', 'scene', 'shattering', 'perspective', 'journalist', 'decision', 'ruin', 'life', 'matter', 'one', 'triumphs', 'film', 'including', 'government', 'torment', 'journalist', 'year', 'jail.There', 'good', 'acting', 'movie', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'ably', 'one-dimensional', 'portrait', 'government', 'prosecutor', 'intent', 'finding', 'traitor', 'was', 'journalist', 'source', 'Real', 'life', 'lawyer', 'Floyd', 'Abrams', 'who', 'represented', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'Miller-Plume', 'case', 'credible', 'judge', 'managing', 'journalist', 'life', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'pretty', 'good', 'lawyer', 'two', 'women', 'leading', 'roles', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'first', 'choices', 'play', 'are', 'little', 'too', 'pretty', 'not', 'gritty', 'enough', 'situations', 'are', 'was', 'Hollywood', 'production', 'all.Personally', 'was', 'struck', 'dramatically', 'film', 'left', 'lingering', 'questions', 'worked', 'state', 'government', 'years', 'whenever', 'took', 'one', 'tests', 'beliefs', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'scored', 'statist', 'meaning', 'thought', 'government', 'intervention', 'things', 'was', 'OK', 'maybe', 'even', 'better', 'OK', 'even', 'always', 'thought', 'political', 'moderate', 'voted', 'persons', 'parties', 'am', 'also', 'journalism', 'graduate', 'major', 'American', 'university', 'worked', 'news', 'media', 'advertising', 'industry', 'three', 'decades', 'working', 'government.This', 'film', 'gave', 'pause', 'mixed', 'beliefs', 'personal', 'liberty', 'government', 'ability', 'aid', 'apathy', 'world', 'live', 'where', 'are', 'required', 'remove', 'shoes', 'aiports', 'go', 'metal', 'detectors', 'schools', 'run', 'Boston', 'marathon', 'risk', 'being', 'bombed', 'resulting', 'power', 'U.S.', 'government', 'absorbed', 'democracy', 'result', 'Does', 'government', 'have', 'too', 'much', 'power', 'First', 'Amendment', 'still', 'effectual', 'are', 'questions', 'asked', 'watching', 'Nothihng', 'Truth', 'topical', 'political', 'drama', 'material', 'suggest', 'larger', 'political', 'governmental', 'issues', 'society', '2013']",Nothing But the Truth

It kind of grew on me.For starters, as I've said several times about films w journalists, so few films, actors ever get it right, and so is the case here. If you ever saw the film Company Town, was it, Ben Affleck? Kevin Costner, as a contractor, gives one of his best performances. And it's not how he wields a hammer. It's the weariness, the tediousness of the occupation. He nails it.Kate Beckinsale is not very convincing as a journalist, but she's not awful either. But major misstep one: Angela Bassett as the boss. If there is one black female running a major US daily I'd be surprised. And if there is, a film I'm sure could and should be made of her. Apart from that curious, questionable casting call, nothing Bassett does -- usually a fine actress -- rings true. Nothing. Nothing to her character suggests she knows anything about a newsroom or the news business. (And when, in jail, Beckinsale asks her to write a supportive editorial, and Bassett says of course; the editorial side does not write editorials in a newspaper. The publishing side does.)More bad news: Matt Dillon and Alan Alda. Alan Alda is one of those lucky actors w the easiest acting gig in the world, which is, basically: think you can do Alan Alda again? Which he is always able to do. However, the speech before the court, where he asks them what would happen to democracy in America if journalists weren't allowed to do their job, is very well done. He does get better as the film  goes along.Dillon, it is clear from his first moment on camera, has no clue who his character is, so he wings it throughout the film. As w every performance like that, it's really annoying.Farmiga is good; Schwimmer and Wyle are basically non-entities.As for these comparisons to real-life &#34;journalist&#34; Judith Miller: Judith Miller is and was a lying hack.

What if this journalist discovered that the White House had taken intelligence from a CIA operative and falsified it as an excuse to justify a war with an enemy country that the White House wanted to invade?  What if the journalist discovered this information in a way that meant that the person who supplied the information had committed treason?  Would the journalist's first obligation be to keep secret the information, or at least to protect the identify of the person who supplied the information, or would the journalist's first obligation be to let the world know that the White House had started a war on false grounds?Oh wait - there IS such a story.  Actually, there are two such stories.  The real Valerie Plame story, covered by New York Times reporter Judith Miller, is the one that SHOULD make Americans quake in their bones.  Rod Lurie's ""Nothing But The Truth"" provides instead a thinly fictionalized version of the story.  Would the real story have made a better film?  Roger Ebert wrote: ""In real life, Miller's reporting, accuracy and objectivity were sharply questioned, and Lurie wisely sidesteps history to focus on the underlying question: Which is more important, the principle of confidentiality, or national security?""I'm frankly amazed by people who think that their President deserves absolutely unquestionable devotion - as long as the President is from their party.  The Founding Father's clearly intended, and great leaders from Abraham Lincoln to Eisenhower have known, that the U.S. Government was specifically designed and set up to have checks and balances.If my President uses fabricated intelligence as an excuse to send hundreds of thousands of Americans to war, resulting in the deaths of thousands of my brothers and sisters, I want to know about that, and I want that act to be accountable.Now to the film: Kate Beckinsale stars as Rachel Armstrong, the reporter who smells a Pulitzer and frankly doesn't completely think through the repercussions of her story.  Matt Dillon is cast as special prosecutor Patton Dubois, and although the story has him in direct opposition to Rachel, he is portrayed as a man who wants to do his job and protect national interests.  Angela Bassett plays Rachel's editor, who knows that she has a bombshell of a story, and knows better than Rachel the fall-out that will come because of it.  Alan Alda plays a hotshot DC lawyer who the lesser lawyers studied in law school and is brought in to fight to keep Rachel out of prison and for her right to protect her sources.  Vera Farmiga (the psychiatrist girlfriend from The Departed) is excellent as the outed CIA agent, Erica Van Doren.  In a very real way she pays the highest toll for the story, and this ""leftist"" movie doesn't sugar-coat that.  Valerie Plame lost her CIA job, but got a big-bucks book deal for ""Fair Game: My Life as a Spy, My Betrayal by the White House."" The fictional Van Doren doesn't fare as well.  Miller's real-life lawyer, Floyd Abrams, plays the judge who doesn't hesitate to send Rachel to prison.Watching the film progress, watching day after day add up on Rachel's prison time, the viewer can't help but wonder, especially when several loopholes are offered, why Rachel doesn't just go ahead and name her source, especially when the Vice President's Chief of Staff comes forward and admits that he was her corroborating source.The final scene of the movie explains why Rachel so doggedly protects her source.  It is not a cop-out, and it is believable, and it provides an appropriate ending to this believable and well-made movie.",5,"When the public's ""right to know"" conflicts with ""National Security""",1242691200,"05 19, 2009",2009,3675,"['What', 'was', 'story', 'featured', 'Washington', 'political', 'journalist', 'lead', 'What', 'journalist', 'discovered', 'White', 'House', 'had', 'taken', 'intelligence', 'CIA', 'operative', 'falsified', 'excuse', 'justify', 'war', 'enemy', 'country', 'White', 'House', 'wanted', 'invade', 'What', 'journalist', 'discovered', 'information', 'way', 'meant', 'person', 'who', 'supplied', 'information', 'had', 'committed', 'treason', 'Would', 'journalist', 'first', 'obligation', 'be', 'keep', 'secret', 'information', 'least', 'protect', 'identify', 'person', 'who', 'supplied', 'information', 'would', 'journalist', 'first', 'obligation', 'be', 'let', 'world', 'know', 'White', 'House', 'had', 'started', 'war', 'false', 'grounds', 'Oh', 'wait', 'such', 'story', 'Actually', 'are', 'two', 'such', 'stories', 'real', 'Valerie', 'Plame', 'story', 'covered', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'reporter', 'Judith', 'Miller', 'one', 'SHOULD', 'make', 'Americans', 'quake', 'bones', 'Rod', 'Lurie', 'Nothing', 'Truth', 'instead', 'thinly', 'fictionalized', 'version', 'story', 'Would', 'real', 'story', 'have', 'made', 'better', 'film', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'wrote', 'real', 'life', 'Miller', 'reporting', 'accuracy', 'objectivity', 'were', 'sharply', 'questioned', 'Lurie', 'wisely', 'history', 'focus', 'underlying', 'question', 'more', 'important', 'principle', 'confidentiality', 'national', 'security', ""'m"", 'frankly', 'amazed', 'people', 'who', 'think', 'President', 'absolutely', 'unquestionable', 'devotion', 'as', 'long', 'President', 'party', 'Founding', 'Father', 'clearly', 'intended', 'great', 'leaders', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'Eisenhower', 'have', 'known', 'U.S.', 'Government', 'was', 'specifically', 'designed', 'set', 'up', 'have', 'checks', 'balances.If', 'President', 'fabricated', 'intelligence', 'excuse', 'send', 'hundreds', 'thousands', 'Americans', 'war', 'resulting', 'deaths', 'thousands', 'brothers', 'sisters', 'want', 'know', 'want', 'act', 'be', 'accountable.Now', 'film', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'Rachel', 'Armstrong', 'reporter', 'who', 'Pulitzer', 'frankly', ""n't"", 'completely', 'think', 'repercussions', 'story', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'cast', 'special', 'prosecutor', 'Patton', 'Dubois', 'story', 'direct', 'opposition', 'Rachel', 'portrayed', 'man', 'who', 'do', 'job', 'protect', 'national', 'interests', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'Rachel', 'editor', 'who', 'bombshell', 'story', 'better', 'Rachel', 'fall-out', 'will', 'come', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'hotshot', 'DC', 'lawyer', 'who', 'lesser', 'lawyers', 'studied', 'law', 'school', 'brought', 'fight', 'keep', 'Rachel', 'prison', 'right', 'protect', 'sources', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', 'psychiatrist', 'girlfriend', 'Departed', 'excellent', 'outed', 'CIA', 'agent', 'Erica', 'Van', 'Doren', 'very', 'real', 'way', 'highest', 'toll', 'story', 'leftist', 'movie', ""n't"", 'sugar-coat', 'Valerie', 'Plame', 'lost', 'CIA', 'job', 'got', 'big-bucks', 'book', 'deal', 'Fair', 'Game', 'Life', 'Spy', 'My', 'Betrayal', 'White', 'House', 'fictional', 'Van', 'Doren', ""n't"", 'fare', 'as', 'well', 'Miller', 'real-life', 'lawyer', 'Floyd', 'Abrams', 'judge', 'who', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'send', 'Rachel', 'prison.Watching', 'film', 'progress', 'watching', 'day', 'day', 'add', 'up', 'Rachel', 'prison', 'time', 'viewer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'especially', 'when', 'several', 'loopholes', 'are', 'offered', 'why', 'Rachel', ""n't"", 'just', 'go', 'ahead', 'name', 'source', 'especially', 'when', 'Vice', 'President', 'Chief', 'Staff', 'forward', 'was', 'corroborating', 'source.The', 'final', 'scene', 'movie', 'why', 'Rachel', 'so', 'doggedly', 'source', 'not', 'cop-out', 'believable', 'appropriate', 'ending', 'believable', 'well-made', 'movie']",Nothing But the Truth

A very strong cast (led by Matt Dillon, Alan Alda, a terrific Vera Farmiga and Kate Beckinsale) takes the Valerie Plame case (in which a CIA agent is outed in the press to punish her husband for criticizing the President) and somehow makes it less grey, less interesting. Beckinsale is the journalist who refuses to reveal her primary source. Dillon is the Patrick Fitzgerald-like attorney who wants to show that journalists aren't above the law. Instead of being a patsy for the government, Beckinsale is just doing a good job. Instead of being a good agent who then clouds her image by seeking publicity (that Vanity Fair shoot) Farmiga becomes a martyr. And the finale is a major twist I can't discuss. But I can say that Lurie believes the finale makes Beckinsale a lot more noble and understandable in her determination not to crack. To me, it makes her a lot LESS noble and if that doesn't intrigue you I don't know what will.

HOWEVER, you better be sure you are standing up for the RIGHT beliefs.What this film chooses to ignore (or at least downplay) is the vital concept that WITH RIGHTS COME RESPONSIBILITIES.Just because one may feel they have the right to do a certain thing, does not mean they should do that thing.In this case we have a reporter who feels so darned strong about the idea of breaking a big story and revealing the identity of a CIA operative that she seems to give no regard for the consequences, security risks created, the danger to the CIA operative and family, and the string of events this reckless, irresponsible reporting creates.All this reporter cares about is ""break the story"" and ""I will not reveal my sources"".But hey this accurately reflects the arrogant attitude of the Press and News Media today who seem to feel they can pretty much do anything they please to mold public opinion and don't need to answer to anybody.  No surprise Hollywood jumped to make this film and Alan Alda stars in it.Since this was a work of ficton (but based very much on recent real world events), my wife made a comment while watching this film about combining 2 fictional characters.....Her comment was .........

Perhaps they viewed the journalist & those with her as ""good guys"" & the government prosecutor & those with him as ""bad guys"" but I have some questions. Why did the journalist consider it proper to write a story uncovering a CIA operative? Why did the newspaper consider it proper to publish it? Why did the paper's lawyers not see the possible ramifications of the story being published? Why was such a story considered worthy of Pulitzer prize consideration? And when the journalist brought up the issue of her  ""integrity"" in this matter, I was incredulous. What integrity could poaaibly be involved in compromising the security of the US - which is what was involved in her story. What would be the difference between her having her story published by a US newspaper or selling her information to a foreign government considered an enemy of the US? Or to one of that nation's newspapers? Perhaps the most valid point raised by the movie was the question of whether any person or profession is above the nation's laws. The CIA is as valid & necessary a part of our nation as any other organization, business or whatever that can be named & any citizen who compromises its operation should be held legally accountable.

In this film, the real life events are peppered with fiction to add a feminist touch to the story.  We have two women battling it out: a Washington Post reporter (played by Kate Backinsdale) and a CIA agent (played by Vera Farmiga).  The reporter is happily married middle class  wife and mother building her career in the major newspaper. She is ""hollier than thou"" but also ambitious in her desire to build her name as a reputable political reporter.  The other one is smart and ambitious too.  Married to her former university professor and ambassador, also a mother, unapologetically patriotic to the extend that she devotes her life to her CIA career as a secret agent.When newspaper decides to go for the publicity and ignore the fact outing government agent is a form of national treason; federal prosecutor gets involved to investigate the leak and take legal actions so such incident will never happen again.  Each individual stand on their own moral grounds and professional choice: journalist will go to jail to protect her source, agent will resign from the agency that questions her integrity and dedication to her service and patriotism; attorneys will battle on the importance of moral responsibility, personal ethics and priority of national security. All of them have one thing in common: they will not compromise their own values and careers no matter what the cost.",4,Fictionalized Valerie Plame story,1326240000,"01 11, 2012",2012,1628,"['Real', 'life', 'scandal', 'outing', 'CIA', 'agent', 'Valerie', 'Plame', 'White', 'House', 'staff', 'husband', 'indiscretion', 'publicising', 'political', 'opinion', 'adminsitration', 'decision', 'regarding', 'war', 'middle', 'east', 'was', 'talk', 'country', 'months', 'film', 'real', 'life', 'events', 'are', 'peppered', 'fiction', 'add', 'feminist', 'touch', 'story', 'have', 'two', 'women', 'battling', 'Washington', 'Post', 'reporter', 'played', 'Kate', 'Backinsdale', 'CIA', 'agent', 'played', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', 'reporter', 'happily', 'married', 'middle', 'class', 'wife', 'mother', 'building', 'career', 'major', 'newspaper', 'hollier', 'thou', 'also', 'ambitious', 'desire', 'build', 'name', 'reputable', 'political', 'reporter', 'other', 'one', 'smart', 'ambitious', 'too', 'Married', 'former', 'university', 'professor', 'ambassador', 'also', 'mother', 'unapologetically', 'patriotic', 'extend', 'life', 'CIA', 'career', 'secret', 'agent.When', 'newspaper', 'go', 'publicity', 'ignore', 'fact', 'outing', 'government', 'agent', 'form', 'national', 'treason', 'federal', 'prosecutor', 'involved', 'investigate', 'leak', 'take', 'legal', 'actions', 'so', 'such', 'incident', 'will', 'never', 'happen', 'again', 'individual', 'stand', 'own', 'moral', 'grounds', 'professional', 'choice', 'journalist', 'will', 'go', 'jail', 'protect', 'source', 'agent', 'will', 'resign', 'agency', 'questions', 'integrity', 'dedication', 'service', 'patriotism', 'attorneys', 'will', 'battle', 'importance', 'moral', 'responsibility', 'personal', 'ethics', 'priority', 'national', 'security', 'have', 'one', 'thing', 'common', 'will', 'not', 'compromise', 'own', 'values', 'careers', 'matter', 'what', 'cost']",Nothing But the Truth

Rachel believes she has happened upon the Big Story, and is backed by her editor (Angela Bassett), the newspaper's legal counsel (Noah Wyle), and her First Amendment lawyer (Alan Alda).  Federal prosecutor Patton Dubois (Matt Dillon) wants her to name her sources.  She refuses and is thrown in jail for contempt of court.  She thinks she will soon be released, but as her incarceration lengthens, her relationship with husband (David Schwimmer) and son (Preston Bailey) starts to deteriorate.Performances are first-rate in this tense political thriller.  Beckinsale is sympathetic as the idealistic yet frightened reporter, but Dillon dazzles as the Javert-like Fed who will use anything and everything within his power to break the reporter's will.  The changing relationship between Rachel and her family gives the film humanity and elevates it from a mere ""ripped from the headlines"" flick to one of depth.Bonus extras include deleted scenes, a making-of featurette, and filmmakers' commentary.",4,Drama Based on Newspaper Headlines,1243036800,"05 23, 2009",2009,1406,"['Nothing', 'Truth', 'based', 'events', 'surrounding', 'prison', 'sentence', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'reporter', 'Judith', 'Miller', 'refused', 'reveal', 'source', 'who', 'identified', 'undercover', 'CIA', 'agent', 'Valerie', 'Plame.Prompted', 'failed', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'investigative', 'reporter', 'Rachel', 'Armstrong', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'neighborhood', 'woman', 'CIA', 'operative', 'Rachel', 'happened', 'Big', 'Story', 'backed', 'editor', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'newspaper', 'legal', 'counsel', 'Noah', 'Wyle', 'First', 'Amendment', 'lawyer', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'Federal', 'prosecutor', 'Patton', 'Dubois', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'name', 'sources', 'thrown', 'jail', 'contempt', 'court', 'will', 'soon', 'be', 'released', 'incarceration', 'relationship', 'husband', 'David', 'Schwimmer', 'son', 'Preston', 'Bailey', 'deteriorate.Performances', 'are', 'first-rate', 'tense', 'political', 'thriller', 'Beckinsale', 'sympathetic', 'idealistic', 'yet', 'frightened', 'reporter', 'Dillon', 'Javert-like', 'Fed', 'who', 'will', 'use', 'anything', 'everything', 'power', 'break', 'reporter', 'will', 'changing', 'relationship', 'Rachel', 'family', 'film', 'humanity', 'mere', 'ripped', 'headlines', 'flick', 'one', 'depth.Bonus', 'extras', 'include', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'filmmakers', 'commentary']",Nothing But the Truth
