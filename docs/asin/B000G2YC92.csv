It's a fun interactive game where each time you play it it takes you to a new path and you leanr mroea bout it and have loads more fun, it's like your watching a Bratz movie cause they look like what they do on their movies and stuff, but it's also a game. That's why it sounds like a ton of fun. Can't wait till it comes out. Bratz, Danny Phantom, and My Scene ROCK!!!",5,Looks like fun,1151280000,"06 26, 2006",2006,422,"['heard', 'game', 'loads', 'fun', 'fun', 'interactive', 'game', 'where', 'time', 'play', 'new', 'path', 'leanr', 'have', 'loads', 'more', 'fun', 'watching', 'Bratz', 'movie', 'cause', 'look', 'what', 'do', 'movies', 'stuff', 'also', 'game', 'why', 'ton', 'fun', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'till', 'out', 'Bratz', 'Danny', 'Phantom', 'My', 'Scene', 'ROCK']",Livin' It Up!

The animation was poor compared to the other Bratz movies, when they moved, they seemed week and lifeless; the voices could have been better too. Also, it was more of a movies then a game.",3,Okay....,1265846400,"02 11, 2010",2010,281,"['LOVE', 'Bratz', 'have', 'movies', 'love', 'one', 'was', 'disapointment', 'animation', 'was', 'poor', 'compared', 'other', 'Bratz', 'movies', 'when', 'moved', 'seemed', 'week', 'lifeless', 'voices', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'too', 'Also', 'was', 'more', 'movies', 'then', 'game']",Livin' It Up!

It's a interactive DVD, so you can choose what the girls do! It's all CGI graphics and it looks so amazing. Cloe, Sasha, Yasmin, Jade perform music videos and everything!

Parkinson ""Film & Book VIP""","[10, 11]","I bought the first two BRATZ DVD (from FOX Home Video) for my pre-teen niece, and she liked them alot, but complained that the animation wasn't up to Disney or Pixar quality.  Imagine our surprise to find that this newest BRATZ video, ""Livin It Up With The Bratz"" is right on target with the best quality 3-D animation in the world.  The closing credits indicate that the Jim Henson Creature Factory was involved with the motion-capture aspects, with the balance of the animation coming from the acclaimed ""Extra-Large Technology"" group in Hollywood.  In addition to superior animation, this video features a great plot line, and even stronger songs.  The clincher is the DVD's ""interactive"" mode which enables multiple choices to be made throughout the program, each with different results. The interactive mode is controlled by the DVD remote, so it's really easy to use.  My niece and two of her girlfriends watched this program (and played with the interactive options) for three hours straight, making this a truly cost-effective piece of entertainment!",5,Ten Times better than any previous BRATZ video!,1154304000,"07 31, 2006",2006,1058,"['bought', 'first', 'two', 'BRATZ', 'DVD', 'FOX', 'Home', 'Video', 'pre-teen', 'niece', 'liked', 'alot', 'complained', 'animation', 'was', ""n't"", 'up', 'Disney', 'Pixar', 'quality', 'Imagine', 'surprise', 'find', 'newest', 'BRATZ', 'video', 'Livin', 'Up', 'Bratz', 'right', 'target', 'best', 'quality', '3-D', 'animation', 'world', 'closing', 'credits', 'indicate', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'Creature', 'Factory', 'was', 'involved', 'motion-capture', 'aspects', 'balance', 'animation', 'coming', 'acclaimed', 'Extra-Large', 'Technology', 'group', 'Hollywood', 'addition', 'superior', 'animation', 'video', 'great', 'plot', 'line', 'even', 'stronger', 'songs', 'clincher', 'DVD', 'interactive', 'mode', 'multiple', 'choices', 'be', 'made', 'program', 'different', 'results', 'interactive', 'mode', 'controlled', 'DVD', 'remote', 'really', 'easy', 'use', 'niece', 'two', 'girlfriends', 'watched', 'program', 'played', 'interactive', 'options', 'three', 'hours', 'straight', 'making', 'truly', 'cost-effective', 'piece', 'entertainment']",Livin' It Up!
