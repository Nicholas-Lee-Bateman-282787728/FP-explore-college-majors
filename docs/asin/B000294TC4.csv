I like movies based on true stories. So why didn't I like this better?It's a dark film, both physically and metaphorically. While Kelly takes on a rather Robin Hood character, and gets a good bit of support from the general public, somehow it just doesn't mean I come to admire him. Yes, he and his family suffered outrageous injustice at the hands of a heartless authority structure, including outright theft of their property and being jailed for no reason. But the Kelly Gang -- Ned and his brother Dan, Joe Byrne and Steve Hart -- do their part to escalate the war between them and the authorities.And it's a dark film physically, making it hard to know what's going on much of the time. Ned's gang prepares for the final confrontation with heavy iron armor, but you can barely see it, or what parts of their bodies it covers, because the confrontation comes on a dark and rainy night. There are huge numbers of cops and soldiers, which Kelly had hoped to stop by tearing up the rails in front of the train they were riding in. So when it is discovered that they had been betrayed, and the train stopped ahead of the torn up rails, the large numbers of civilians with which they were holed up should have been allowed to leave quickly and quietly. Instead, they were fired upon and a good many of them killed or wounded.The final fight is a protracted scene, and I can't quite figure why.

827544,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B000294TC4,C. B Collins Jr.,"[0, 0]","Whereas this film is not really historically accurate, it captures the basic spirit og the person and now legendary Ned Kelly.  Heath Ledger does a very good job of playing Ned Kelly.  Kelly was a poor son of recent Irish immigrants to Australia.  Wrongfully imprisoned, he is doomed to the heightened scrutiny of the police who see him as a trouble-maker. His sense of injustice in combination with the killing of 3 policemen in self-defense resulted in a wild rampage of bank robberies and other Robin Hood type adventures.  There was considerable tensions between poor Roman Catholic Irishmen, often sent to Australia in leau of prison, and the Protestant English settlers who had considerably more capital investments. Orlando Bloom does a good job playing Joe Byrne, Kell's friend and partner.  Lawrence Kerilan and Phillip Baratino play Ned's younger brother and best friend.  They were virtually children, aged 16 or 17, as part of the Kelly gang.  Naomi Watts offers a performance as a romantic interest of Kelly, but this section seemed tacked on and inconsequential in comparison to Kelly's exploits and his growing recognition of his own embodiment of the resentment of the poor Irish settlers.  Two other actors worth mention were the great Brenda Griffiths and Joel Edgerton who plays the shifting traitor Arron Skerrett.  A great book on this topic is The True Story of the Kelly Gang by Peter Carey.

827545,A1W7JW829H45AE,B000294TC4,"Charles M. Strnad ""Washed up jock""","[1, 2]","I like movies about true stories, which always tends to raise the question: just how much creative license from a director is OK in a movie based on fact? When does a movie cease to be entertaining because of historical innacuracies (or even pure fabrications)? Is it possible to tell a historical story in film accurately, and yet have it still be engrossing and entertaining, and not feel like a documentary (real life can be pretty mundane, after all)?I stumbled across ""Ned Kelly"" about a year ago(this 2003 version- there have been others) while surfing through movie titles that I thought I might want to own. Though I am an avid reader of history from all time periods, I had no previous knowledge of the historical Kelly figure, but thought the cast and story-line looked interesting, so I bought a copy, and enjoyed it so much that I have since watched it 3-4 times: one of my marks of a good movie is just that....you want to watch it more than once. And after watching it again just last night, and enjoying it perhaps even more than the last time, I felt I'd offer this review, particularly concentrating on the history vs: entertainment issues mentioned above. Like all good historical movies, ""Ned Kelly"" has caused me since to go back and read several of the published histories on the real man (the best of which is Ian Jones' ""Ned Kelly: A Short Life""), and I was pleasantly surprised to learn that this film version did an admirable job of sticking to the known facts (such as can be done with a partly mythical folk hero such as Kelly, as all good folk heroes are typically part fact and part legend, and more often than not, the legend predominates), and yet was still completely absorbing and entertaining. More on this below.First, the essentials: this 2003 release, directed by Gregor Jordan and based on the book ""Our Sunshine"" by Robert Drewe (an admittedly sympathetic take on Kelly) is a short 110 minutes long. One of my complaints in fact is that this is one film that would have benefited from an additional 15-20 minutes of run-time, especially to offer a bit more character development, as the principal actors are very appealing, but perhaps not fleshed-out enough to really suck you in to the tale, and feel more for their historical fate. The musical score by Klaus Badelt (""Pirates of the Carribean"") is very moving, at times sweeping, at times subdued and sad, and by itself is a piece of musical composition worth owning as a stand-alone music CD(I've ordered one anyway). The cinematography is outstanding, capturing the rugged beauty of the 1870's Australian landscape with numerous beautiful still shots, without ever detracting from the action story that is unfolding. A+ camera work here.The cinematography and musical score create a very believable period look to the film- I was transported back in time to 1870's Australia.The story in brief is that of the bushranger Kelly, who was eventually made into outlaw #1 of the British police, for various offenses ranging from the alleged stealing of a horse, to the confirmed killing by Kelly and his gang of 3 British police officers, for which they were hunted down for a period of almost 2 years, before a climactic firefight at Glenrowan Inn. The historical accuracy of all this was spot on, with the main exception being the climactic fight, where the movie shows numerous police officers killed by Kelly's gang, and a half dozen bystander civilians at the inn also killed in the chaotic crossfire from the police. In actual fact, only one police officer was wounded (none killed), and only 2 civilians were killed. The real Superintendent Hare was the only policeman wounded, as shown in the film, but in reality he also actually fled the scene, and was even reprimanded officially for this by the Crown afterwards.But again, this is creative license that didn't detract from my enjoyment of the movie, though I suppose Kelly purists might object a little. The movie ends with Kelly's capture after the final gun fight- it does not cover his subsequent imprisonment, trial, and hanging execution, though the history on that is fascinating enough to be another full movie. There is a lot portrayed in the movie to suggest that Kelly's cause was a righteous one, and that police corruption and harrassment drove him to his crimes. If you think that sounds too one-sided, then read some of the histories about his subsequent trial, which is rife with unsubstantiated ""evidence"" and legalisms and good-old hypocrisy on the part of the British court that eventually convicted him to hanging.The cast is outstanding. The late Heath Ledger has the title role, and resembles the real Kelly well enough (from available photographs of the man), including the awesome full beard. Orlando Bloom is Kelly's main sidekick, Joe Byrne, and he lends a good deal of color and character to his role. Geoffrey Rush has an all-too brief role as Superintendent Francis Hare, the Victorian cop given the task of bringing Kelly to justice. Naomi Watts is the main creative license addition, as a love interest for Kelly, but primarily as a cinematic technique, to make the story more than a mere documentary about Kelly's life. The real Kelly's father was employed at the ranch of the Quinn family (Watts plays the wife Julia Cook of the farm owner), and there is no clear historical documentation of any major love interest in the real Kelly's life, though it is certainly no stretch to believe there may have been. Watts' role in the movie, beyond the brief romance, is also to help illustrate the class struggles/tensions between the blue-collar Irishman Kelly, and the upperclass Victorian British elite, to which Watts belongs. In one illustrative moment in the movie, Kelly asks Julia Cook (Watts) to testify that he couldn't have been present at the time of a crime he is alleged to have committed, for the primary reason that he was rolling in the hay at the time with Watts. While she is clearly conflicted by her attraction to Kelly, she cannot help him, for the shame it would bring to her as a married, Victorian lady. A tense moment in the film, very well-acted.The supporting cast is excellent throughout, complete with believable accents and dialogue appropriate to the times (thankfully no modern concessions to profanity, etc, in this flick).I thought the acting was first rate throughout, with my main complaint again being that more time devoted to knowing the principal characters would have made this a much better film. While the movie clearly takes a sympathetic tone to Kelly and his gang, the dramatic impact of their eventual fate was lessened by my feeling that I didn't really know these people as well as I wanted to.There are numerous details in the film, from the main plot to even tiny details like Kelly's green sash (awarded to him as a boy for saving another boy from drowning, which he also wore in the climactic Glenrowan fight with the police)that are historically accurate, and well documented in the written histories. Aside from Watts and the final gun battle, in fact, most of the rest seems to be just as it is supposed to have happened- with the singular aspect being that it is also told with captivating moviemaking, acting, music, and cinematography: a very nice blend of history and creative moviemaking.I suspect that viewers familiar with the Kelly history will be reasonably pleased with this movie, whether they are sympathetic to Kelly or not....and for those(like me) who see this with no prior knowledge of the story, it will be a movie worth seeing more than once. It's just good story-telling, about a legendary outlaw from the past....a lot like the American version, Jesse James, who has been similarly villified and/or revered, depending on your point of view. Highly recommended- and one of Ledger's lesser-known, but very compelling performances.",4,History vs: entertainment: The Aussie Jesse James,1235520000,"02 25, 2009",2009,7881,"['like', 'movies',

In fact, I found that to be part of this film's appeal, in that it provides a rare and entertaining look at how similar life was ""over there"" at that time to those most of us have seen a million times in tales of the American west.That said, Director Gregor Jordan's Kelly tale is also an allegory demonstrating again how easily a government with absolute authority and no valid system of checks and balances can be used maliciously and abusively by a corrupt few.  Given the abuses of power by members of today's American government, with a corrupt core even working to override and ignore the checks and balances supposedly assured by our system, it's a good reminder of what can happen to any individual -- especially someone of unpopular origin -- when circumstances are less than perfect, as they often are.As to the accuracy of the film's storyline, good luck determining that. While it seems to be reasonably accurate, if romanticized to accent Kelly's folk appeal, at this point it's hard to say who was right, who was wrong, and to what degree.  Then again, that's a great reason to buy this DVD - it includes a Special Feature about the real Ned Kelly for more perspective on the now century-and-a-half debate over whether he was just a rowdy criminal or a Robin Hood revolutionary standing up for the common man. Probably a little of both.At the very least, the film is well acted both by its primaries - Heath Ledger, Orlando Bloom, Naomi Watts, and Geoffrey Rush - and the many terrific Australian character actors in support roles.

827557,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000294TC4,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[12, 13]","I learned from ""Breaker Morant"" and ""Gallipoli"" that the British had little regard for Australian soldiers so it was not surprising to learn from this 2003 version of the ""Ned Kelly"" story that the British Down Under treated the locals with similar disdain.  When it turns out that the title character is also of Irish decent, well, that is just pouring it on when you cross reference all of the films in which the British make the Irish suffer.  It is easy enough to explain to the casual viewer that Ned Kelly is the Australian equivalent of Jesse James, but that misses the point that Kelly was a much more popular figure in his land that James was (as witnessed at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney where dancers wearing Kelly's iron helmet with the slit, inspired by Sidney Nolan's Ned Kelly paintings) and that his ending was much more fascinating than that of the American outlaw.The story of Ned Kelly as told in Gregor Jordan's film is fairly straightforward.  Young Ned (Heath Ledger) is sent to prison for a crime that he did not commit, condemned by his ethnicity more than any facts, and when he emerges from prison the authorities continue to go after his family.  Since he is being treated like an outlaw he decides to become one along with his brother, Dan (Laurence Kinlan), his best friend, Joe Byrne (Orlando Bloom), and another friend, Steve Hart (Phil Barantini).  Superintendent Francis Hare (Geoffrey Rush) leads the police in the great effort to hunt Ned and the boys down, but the Kelly Gang is popular with the people and are able to ride free for a while.Telling the dramatic story of Kelly's life is hampered by the fact that before his famous last stand at Glenrowan the most notable part of his criminal career was the Jerilderie Letter, a demand for justice written in Ned's own hand that detailed the way he and his family and friends had been treated by the authorities.  This is reduced in the film to a chance to call public officials wombats and the like.  Fortunately the Siege at Glenrown, which constitutes the final act of the film, is more accurate and more compelling, and provides the best reason for checking out this otherwise rather slow moving film.With so many people gunning for him Kelly came up with the idea of fashioning bullet-proof armor that could protect them during their bank robberies.  The gang also came up with a plan to stop a special train at Glenrowan, the area of their staunchest support, but Hare found out about the plan and was able to turn Glenrowan into a trap for Ned and his boys, as well as their supporters.  The battle turned into a siege, with the armor of the Kelly Gang giving them a way of negating the number of armed police that were taking shots at them.The depiction of what happened at Glenrowan is reasonably accurate and is dramatic enough that I can understand why the film does not go on to show either Kelly's trial or execution.  Besides, Jordan has a final ironic touch that he can play with regards to a bloody sash.  The armor worn by the Kelly Gang at Glenrowan is on display at various places around Australia and one of the nice touches of the film is how it shows it providing protection, for the most part, but hampering the efforts of the boys to actually aim and shoot their own guns with any degree of accuracy.  The armor weighed almost 100 pounds and while it could indeed stoop a Martini-Henry bullet at ten paces there were the practical problems of having extra horses to carry it around, the time it took to put it on, and the ways in changed everything from walking to shooting.I underscore the historical accuracy of the Kelly Gang armor because those not well versed in Australian folk history, which is pretty much your entire American audience, might think that this is far fetched.  But you can imagine how the idea of such armor would appeal to four men being hounded by an army of police, so that becoming the ""iron outlaws"" seemed as good a tactic as any to try and change things to give them more of a fighting chance.  The story outweighs the acting and everyone from Ledger and Rush to the supporting cast give the appearance of playing parts in a pageant, which, from the Australian perspective, would most decidedly seem to be the case.

827558,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B000294TC4,Lee Armstrong,"[14, 15]","Gregor Jordan's version of ""Ned Kelly"" may not be quite as playful as the 1970 Mick Jagger version, but it is a well-done recounting of this Australian legend.  Jordan packs the cast with Australian actors who deliver.  Australian Heath Ledger delivers a controlled performance that shows great force.  Ned Kelly shows a different side of Ledger than we've seen in ""10 Things I Hate About You,"" ""A Knight's Tale"" or ""Monster's Ball.""  It may come closest to the tightly wound performance he offered in ""The Order.""  Ledger also starred in Gregor Jordan's first film in 1999, ""Two Hands,"" which I have yet to see; so this is their second teaming.Orlando Bloom does a great job as Kelly's good friend and sidekick.  Quite different than ""Pirates of the Caribbean,"" we get to see a Bloom who is a Romeo, constantly hitting on girls with a twinkle in his eye.  Most hilarious is his scene with Australian Brenda Griffiths as the bank president's wife where he seduces her a floor above where her spectacled husband sits under gun.  Griffiths' Oscar nomination in 1998 for ""Hillary & Jackie"" and her starring role on HBO's series ""6 Feet Under"" have made her face familiar; and she has great fun here with Orlando.Naomi Watts who was born in Great Britain but raised in Australia doesn't have a demanding role as the wife of the horse owner.  She seduces Ned Kelly in the stable.  For her, this is no ""21 Grams,"" ""Mullholland Drive"" or ""The Ring,"" but she does what is required in admirable fashion.The supporting actors also do nice jobs.  Laurence Kinlan as brother Dan Kelly has only one other acting credit, ""Intermission"" with Colin Farrell.  Philip Baratini who plays the other gang member Steve Hart does a good job, and is a newcomer.  Australian Oscar winning actor Geoffrey Rush (Shine) does a nice job with some emotional levels as the British soldier who chases the Kelly gang.  Particularly touching is when he asks for Kelly's sash at the end of the film.  Kerry Condon as Ned's sister Kate does a good job of living it up in the pub & then putting off the British soldier who is pursuing her.  It will be interesting to see her star in 2005 with Jet Li, Morgan Freeman & Bob Hoskins in ""Unleashed.""  Kiri Paramore as the policeman Fitzpatrick who has an eye for Kate does an appropriately repulsive job of hitting on Ned's sister.The pacing of the film is excellent; there are no dead spots.  We see the action of the film mushroom as the injustice of British rule as applied to the Irish in Australia is made.  The cinematography is excellent; and the battle scene is well photographed.  The DVD bonus features are interesting.  Ledger does bear a resemblance to the original Ned Kelly.  It was interesting to see clips from the early Ned Kelly films and from Mick Jagger's 1970 effort.  This is a good film, ably acted & directed.

827562,A1SCD2NYTIAQTY,B000294TC4,Mouldy Pilgrim,"[39, 41]","For most people Down Under, the name Ned Kelly elicits feelings ranging from near religious devotion and hero-worship to the most bitter, deep-seated hatred. Like many figures who have come to be regarded as popular heroes, there has been the accretion of a lot of legend to the name of Ned Kelly, which can make getting to the real man a tall order.The movie, Ned Kelly, is based in the southern state of Victoria, (it was filmed just outside Melbourne), and follows the Kelly Gang through the unjust imprisonment of Ned Kelly (Heath Ledger) and then his mother after false accusations from a Victorian Police officer. Other injustices are committed against the Kelly's and their friends, which only increases Kelly's resolve to hit back. The film climaxes in the last stand made at Glenrowan, and the tragedy that it was.The movie is excellently shot and uses the scenery of Victoria well to give an atmosphere and aura of colonial roughness contrasted with the well-to-do nature of the British middle and upper classes at the time. The film simply looks nice, as well as uses real historical sites. For example, the scene where Ned Kelly leaves prison is the gate to the Old Melbourne jail, (that part is now a building devoted to tertiary education). It is worth a visit, if you are ever in Melbourne, as the wing where Kelly was kept is still intact and open to the public.The principle actors are all excellent in their roles and they bring off the Irish character of the Kellys and their friends well. Orlando Bloom is excellent as Kelly's friend, Joe Byrne. Accurately shown to be fluent in Cantonese, Bloom brings Byrne to life. Heath Ledger does an admirable job of portraying Ned Kelly in the details, bringing to light what motivated and drove Kelly, as well as the emotional struggles that Kelly might have gone through. Laurence Kinlan and Phil Barantini deserve mention as well for their parts as Dan Kelly and Steve Hart respectively, and the protrayal of their tragically short lifes and their courage at the end.The movie is a great story, and brings a man and his friends to life. It is an excellent overview of a complex figure and it attempts to show what the real man was, and in most respects succeeds in doing so. The movie does presents one ""interpretation"" of the Ned Kelly story, and presents him in a very positive light. The director, Gregor Jordan, is very open and honest about this, saying that he hoped people would be encouraged to find out more and form their own opinions. The movie also takes some liberties with the facts, but these do not overly affect the plot or its value as a Kelly movie.If you have never seen or read about Ned Kelly, then I would suggest that one read a book calledNed Kelly: A Short Lifeby Ian Jones, (available from Amazon). Read it before you see the movie and it will help you understand where the movie is coming from and where the movie is drawing its material from. Secondly, the book will fill in information that is either not given in the movie, or could be easily missed. This information would provide a greater understanding of why Kelly does things in the movie.For example, the reason for the siege at Glenrowan is not terribly clear in the movie, though it is indirectly alluded to in a couple of scenes. One scene is when Kelly and Byrne are writing the Jerrilderee Letter, and Kelly warns people not to ""attempt to reside"" in Victoria. The second scene is when Francis Hare, (Rush), is addressing his officers and warns that the Kelly Gang have been elevated as leaders of a ""movement"" that threatens the very structure of the colony of Victoria. What the book reveals is that Kelly and the Gang were trying to start an uprising, and cut the rail at Gelnrowan to aid them in this. It was not just an attempt to kill as many officers as they could for no real reason. They also had supporters ready to rise in the area around the town, and there were worries after the seige ended that they would still cause trouble.Also, the book presents a more balanced context to the movie. It is not revealed in the movie that Kelly had run with an older bushranger, (bandit), when he was in his teens and learned a lot from the older man, (such as bush craft and bushranging). It was from this older man that Kelly learned the value of a wide support base among the general population. This was helped a lot when the Kelly Gang burned a bank's mortgages, (the farmers got their loans cancelled and their farms free).Overall, the movie is excellent, and I enjoyed it immensely. It is a touching story, and one may need to watch it in the dark to hide the tears, ;-). The story is one worth telling, and the cast and crew of this movie have told the story well. I would only recommend reading the book as well for the reasons above. Love him or hate him, it is undoubted that Ned Kelly makes a great movie and will remain in the popular imagination for generations to come.",4,A Moving Account,1115164800,"05 4,

I tried a variation on the theme last week--since my queue had exactly 330 movies in it, I went to movie #165, right smack in the middle. That turned out to be Gregor Jordan's 2003 biopic Ned Kelly, one of the Heath Ledger movies I can imagine myself ever sitting through (as much as I love Heath Ledger, sorry, A Knight's Tale will never pass these eyes) that I'd never seen, so I hit play and settled in for what Netflix's myriad users promised me was going to be a perfectly average time. I think the movie is a touch better than average, but most of its problems are overlookable.If you're unfamiliar with Australian history (and I will be the first to admit I am nowhere near familiar enough with it to tell you how much of this Jordan got right and how much he made up out of whole cloth), Ned Kelly (Ledger) was a nineteenth-century outlaw/folk hero, which took some doing given Australia's beginnings as a prison colony; how bad do you have to be to get branded an outlaw in the Manhattan of Escape from New York? As the story opens, we see Kelly getting rousted by the law for stealing a horse. (We don't know if he did or not--Kelly's acquisition of said horse, which he claims he found roaming free, takes place the day before the opening sequence. I may be over-reading, but I believe Jordan's intention was for us to believe Kelly is telling the truth here.) Things escalate from there through the first roughly half-hour of the film, culminating in one of Ned's brothers getting into a firefight with the law, which is then blamed on Ned (who wasn't even in the house at the time). Ned's mother is thrown in prison as a way to get Ned to turn himself in; instead, Ned, his brother Dan (Boy Eats Girl's Laurence Kinlan), and their respective best friends Joseph Byrne (Lord of the Rings franchise mainstay Orlando Bloom) and Steve Hart (The Escapist's Philip Barantini), form an outlaw band, base themselves in the wilderness, and start robbing banks. This turns out to be a relatively easy way of making money in rural Australia, and before long, Ned Kelly is sending goading letters to the cops--in one memorable scene from the movie, partially using verbiage supplied him by the ""hostages"" the Kelly Gang have taken in the bank, all of whom are enthusiastic supporters by the time they leave--and transforming from ""armed and dangerous"" to ""can I have your autograph?"". However, the law is unamused, and calls in Francis Hare (Quills' Geoffrey Rush), notorious for his strong-arm tactics with lawbreakers.It's a fun little thing, though it feels like, given that it's a docudrama, it should have more weight behind it. It also feels like a good deal got left on the cutting-room floor (Naomi Watts' character, who exists in order to provide a romantic subplot, seems like she got a lot more screen time in earlier cuts of the movie), but that could simply be because Jordan is so obsessed with Heath Ledger. Which is understandable; Heath Ledger never encountered a camera that didn't fall in love with him, though that tendency does give folks who end up in movies with him short shrift. It almost feels like the camera is snubbing Bloom in a couple of scenes here. I found that, well, kind of amusing actually. Your mileage will probably vary. Ned Kelly is a good movie, but it feels like it could have been a great one. ***",3,The Absolutely True Diaries of a Part-Time Outlaw,1369440000,"05 25, 2013",2013,3612,"['Ned', 'Kelly', 'Gregor', 'Jordan', '2003', 'One', 'week', 'two', 'sort', 'Netflix', 'queue', 'average', 'rating', 'grab', 'something', 'bottom', 'five', 'usually', 'get', 'good', 'time', 'entire', 'Netflix', 'community', 'then', 'golly', 'must', 'be', 'something', 'good', 'tried', 'variation', 'theme', 'last', 'week', 'queue', 'had', 'exactly', '330', 'movies', 'went', 'movie', '165', 'right', 'smack', 'middle', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'Gregor', 'Jordan', '2003', 'biopic', 'Ned', 'Kelly', 'one', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'movies', 'can', 'imagine', 'ever', 'sitting', 'through', 'as', 'much', 'love', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'sorry', 'A', 'Knight', 'Tale', 'will', 'never', 'pass', 'eyes', ""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'hit', 'play', 'settled', 'what', 'Netflix', 'myriad', 'users', 'promised', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'perfectly', 'average', 'time', 'think', 'movie', 'touch', 'better', 'average', 'most', 'problems', 'are', ""'re"", 'unfamiliar', 'Australian', 'history', 'will', 'be', 'first', 'admit', 'am', 'nowhere', 'familiar', 'enough', 'tell', 'how', 'much', 'Jordan', 'got', 'right', 'how', 'much', 'made', 'up', 'whole', 'cloth', 'Ned', 'Kelly', 'Ledger', 'was', 'nineteenth-century', 'outlaw/folk', 'hero', 'took', 'doing', 'given', 'Australia', 'beginnings', 'prison', 'colony', 'how', 'bad', 'do', 'have', 'be', 'get', 'branded', 'outlaw', 'Manhattan', 'Escape', 'New', 'York', 'story', 'see', 'Kelly', 'getting', 'rousted', 'law', 'stealing', 'horse', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'did', 'not', 'Kelly', 'acquisition', 'said', 'horse', 'found', 'roaming', 'free', 'place', 'day', 'opening', 'sequence', 'may', 'be', 'over-reading', 'believe', 'Jordan', 'intention', 'was', 'believe', 'Kelly', 'telling', 'truth', 'here', 'Things', 'escalate', 'first', 'roughly', 'half-hour', 'film', 'culminating', 'one', 'Ned', 'brothers', 'getting', 'firefight', 'law', 'then', 'blamed', 'Ned', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'house', 'time', 'Ned', 'mother', 'thrown', 'prison', 'way', 'get', 'Ned', 'turn', 'instead', 'Ned', 'brother', 'Dan', 'Boy', 'Eats', 'Girl', 'Laurence', 'Kinlan', 'respective', 'best', 'friends', 'Joseph', 'Byrne', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'franchise', 'mainstay', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'Steve', 'Hart', 'Escapist', 'Philip', 'Barantini', 'form', 'outlaw', 'band', 'base', 'wilderness', 'start', 'robbing', 'banks', 'out', 'be', 'relatively', 'easy', 'way', 'making', 'money', 'rural', 'Australia', 'long', 'Ned', 'Kelly', 'sending', 'goading', 'letters', 'cops', 'one', 'memorable', 'scene', 'movie', 'partially', 'using', 'verbiage', 'supplied', 'hostages', 'Kelly', 'Gang', 'have', 'taken', 'bank', 'whom', 'are', 'enthusiastic', 'supporters', 'time', 'leave', 'transforming', 'armed', 'dangerous', 'can', 'have', 'autograph', 'However', 'law', 'unamused', 'Francis', 'Hare', 'Quills', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'notorious', 'strong-arm', 'tactics', 'lawbreakers.It', 'fun', 'little', 'thing', 'given', 'docudrama', 'should', 'have', 'more', 'weight', 'also', 'good', 'deal', 'got', 'left', 'cutting-room', 'floor', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'character', 'who', 'order', 'provide', 'romantic', 'subplot', 'got', 'lot', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'earlier', 'cuts', 'movie', 'could', 'simply', 'be', 'Jordan', 'so', 'obsessed', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Which', 'understandable', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'never', 'encountered', 'camera', 'did', ""n't"", 'fall', 'love', 'tendency', 'give', 'folks', 'who', 'end', 'up', 'movies', 'short', 'shrift', 'almost', 'feels', 'camera', 'snubbing', 'Bloom', 'couple', 'scenes', 'here', 'found', 'well', 'kind', 'amusing', 'actually', 'Your', 'mileage', 'will', 'probably', 'vary', 'Ned', 'Kelly', 'good', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'one', '***']",N/A

Zwick,"[4, 9]","If the term itself were not geographically and semantically meaningless, one might well refer to ""Ned Kelly"" as an ""Australian Western.""  For the people Down Under, Ned Kelly was, apparently, a folk hero bandit akin to Robin Hood, Jesse James, Bonnie and Clyde, and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.  The descendant of Irish immigrants, Kelly became a fugitive and an outlaw after he was falsely accused of shooting an Australian law officer, a crime for which his equally innocent mother was put into prison.  To get back at the government for this mistreatment, Kelly, his brother Dan, and two other companions, became notorious bank robbers, winning over the hearts of many people in the countryside while striking a blow for justice in a land where Irish immigrants were often treated with disrespect and disdain by those who ran the country.Perhaps because we've encountered this ""gentleman bandit"" scenario so many times in the past, ""Ned Kelly"" feels awfully familiar and unoriginal as it pays homage to any number of the genre's stereotypes and cliches on its way to the inevitable showdown.  Ned is the typical heart-of-gold lawbreaker who kills only when he is forced to and, even then, only with the deepest regret.  He also has the pulse of the common folk, as when, in the middle of a bank robbery, he returns a valuable watch to one of the customers, after one of his gang has so inconsiderately pilfered it.  What movie on this particular subject hasn't featured a scene like that?  It`s acts of selective generosity like this, of course, that earn him the love and respect of all the little people who come to secretly admire anyone who can get away with sticking it to the powers-that-be and the status quo.  Geoffrey Rush plays the typical bedeviled law enforcer who feels a personal stake in bringing down this upstart troublemaker who keeps getting away with tweaking the establishment.  There's even the inevitable episode in which one of the ladies being held up goes into the next room and has sex with one of the robbers, so turned on is she by the romantic derring-do of the criminal lifestyle.  And the film is riddled with one hackneyed scene like this after another.Heath Ledger fails to distinguish himself in the title role, providing little in the way of substance to make his character either interesting or engaging.  It doesn't help that he has been forced to provide a droning voiceover narration that underlines the sanctimoniousness and pretentiousness of both the character and the film.""Ned Kelly"" might serve a function of sorts as a lesson in Australian history, but as an entertainment, it's just the same old story told with different accents.",2,nothing new from Down Under,1105747200,"01 15, 2005",2005,2688,"['term', 'were', 'not', 'geographically', 'semantically', 'meaningless', 'one', 'might', 'well', 'refer', 'Ned', 'Kelly', 'Australian', 'Western', 'people', 'Down', 'Ned', 'Kelly', 'was', 'apparently', 'folk', 'hero', 'bandit', 'akin', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'Jesse', 'James', 'Bonnie', 'Clyde', 'Butch', 'Cassidy', 'Sundance', 'Kid', 'descendant', 'Irish', 'immigrants', 'Kelly', 'became', 'fugitive', 'outlaw', 'was', 'falsely', 'accused', 'shooting', 'Australian', 'law', 'officer', 'crime', 'equally', 'innocent', 'mother', 'was', 'put', 'prison', 'get', 'back', 'government', 'mistreatment', 'Kelly', 'brother', 'Dan', 'two', 'other', 'companions', 'became', 'notorious', 'bank', 'robbers', 'winning', 'hearts', 'many', 'people', 'countryside', 'striking', 'blow', 'justice', 'land', 'where', 'Irish', 'immigrants', 'were', 'often', 'treated', 'disrespect', 'disdain', 'who', 'ran', 'country.Perhaps', ""'ve"", 'encountered', 'gentleman', 'bandit', 'scenario', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'past', 'Ned', 'Kelly', 'feels', 'awfully', 'familiar', 'unoriginal', 'homage', 'number', 'genre', 'stereotypes', 'cliches', 'way', 'inevitable', 'showdown', 'Ned', 'typical', 'heart-of-gold', 'lawbreaker', 'who', 'only', 'when', 'forced', 'even', 'then', 'only', 'deepest', 'regret', 'also', 'pulse', 'common', 'folk', 'when', 'middle', 'bank', 'robbery', 'valuable', 'watch', 'one', 'customers', 'one', 'gang', 'so', 'inconsiderately', 'pilfered', 'What', 'movie', 'particular', 'subject', ""n't"", 'featured', 'scene', 's', 'acts', 'selective', 'generosity', 'course', 'earn', 'love', 'respect', 'little', 'people', 'who', 'come', 'secretly', 'admire', 'anyone', 'who', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'sticking', 'powers-that-be', 'status', 'quo', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'typical', 'bedeviled', 'law', 'enforcer', 'who', 'personal', 'stake', 'bringing', 'down', 'upstart', 'troublemaker', 'who', 'getting', 'away', 'tweaking', 'establishment', 'even', 'inevitable', 'episode', 'one', 'ladies', 'being', 'held', 'up', 'next', 'room', 'sex', 'one', 'robbers', 'so', 'turned', 'romantic', 'derring-do', 'criminal', 'lifestyle', 'film', 'riddled', 'one', 'hackneyed', 'scene', 'another.Heath', 'Ledger', 'distinguish', 'title', 'role', 'providing', 'little', 'way', 'substance', 'make', 'character', 'interesting', 'engaging', ""n't"", 'help', 'been', 'forced', 'provide', 'droning', 'voiceover', 'narration', 'sanctimoniousness', 'pretentiousness', 'character', 'film', 'Ned', 'Kelly', 'might', 'serve', 'function', 'sorts', 'lesson', 'Australian', 'history', 'entertainment', 'just', 'same', 'old', 'story', 'told', 'different', 'accents']",N/A
827566,A3R5AFKW4FP0U5,B000294TC4,SusieQ,"[3, 4]","I was expecting a lot more from this film.  I thought it was going to be like ""Rob Roy"", the excellent Liam Neeson film from 1995 which also was a story of injustice done to an innocent person.  Unfortunately, this director kept everything so distant that I could never really engage with the characters; couldn't feel invested in what's going to happen to them.  I felt more involved in the special features section, which had a short documentary on the real Ned Kelly--this short documentary made me feel for the characters, the way the big film should have!  Most of the supporting actors are very good, but Naomi Watts, in her pre-Hollywood phase, is really just window dressing here.Still, the movie has some charms.  I love the Australian scenery.  The soundtrack is good.  And for once, I don't want to roll my eyes with disgust at one of Orlando Bloom's performances.  Finally, he has a manly role to play; not some lightweight pretty-boy.  And Heath Ledger is a good actor, who could be a great actor, but he just hasn't been given the right role (as of the date of this review).  if only someone would give this man a meaty part, his career would just take off.  He's the best thing in this movie, but it's not HIS movie, the way ""Rob Roy"" was Liam Neeson's.  I realize that this story was different and that ""Rob Roy"" was able to get revenge on his tormentors in a way that Ned Kelly couldn't.  Still, I expected to feel something more for this character that this film didn't provide.
