For some reason I decided to see what it was like, and have been completely hooked ever since. Seeing that Steve Buscemi is one of the directors intrigued me.There hasn't been a false line in four seasons! Nothing gets old or stale.The characters are superbly played. The drama is a half hour of fast action with fast glimpses of the All Saint's Crew, Jackie's family, and others, through which their personality is revealed in detail often missing in far longer shows. You really get to know these people and can't wait to find out what happens next. The rotation of producers and directors is a good thing, probably a reason the show is so alive, never stale or trite.Not for kids, really. The language is the kind you hope they never pick up, but is the way most of us seem to talk these days. There are fairly vivid sex scenes also. All the X-rated material is appropriate when used and an integral part of the plot, never something pasted on to keep the audience watching. I was surprised that my daughter in her late twenties was somewhat shocked by the show, as she has encountered all sorts of people in school and work.Highly recommended but not for authoritarian personalities...",5,"First class comedy/drama, never a stale moment.",1400371200,"05 18, 2014",2014,1296,"[""'d"", 'always', 'overlooked', '34', 'Nurse', 'Jackie', '34', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'spy', 'shows', 'thrillers', 'scary', 'stories', 'reason', 'decided', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'have', 'been', 'completely', 'hooked', 'ever', 'Seeing', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'one', 'directors', 'intrigued', 'me.There', ""n't"", 'been', 'false', 'line', 'four', 'seasons', 'Nothing', 'old', 'stale.The', 'characters', 'are', 'superbly', 'played', 'drama', 'half', 'hour', 'fast', 'action', 'fast', 'glimpses', 'All', 'Saint', 'Crew', 'Jackie', 'family', 'others', 'personality', 'revealed', 'detail', 'often', 'missing', 'far', 'longer', 'shows', 'really', 'get', 'know', 'people', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'next', 'rotation', 'producers', 'directors', 'good', 'thing', 'probably', 'reason', 'show', 'so', 'alive', 'never', 'stale', 'trite.Not', 'kids', 'really', 'language', 'kind', 'hope', 'never', 'pick', 'up', 'way', 'most', 'seem', 'talk', 'days', 'are', 'fairly', 'vivid', 'sex', 'scenes', 'also', 'X-rated', 'material', 'appropriate', 'when', 'used', 'integral', 'part', 'plot', 'never', 'something', 'pasted', 'keep', 'audience', 'watching', 'was', 'surprised', 'daughter', 'late', 'twenties', 'was', 'somewhat', 'shocked', 'show', 'encountered', 'sorts', 'people', 'school', 'work.Highly', 'recommended', 'not', 'authoritarian', 'personalities']",N/A

Her character is what you call a 'functioning' drug addict where she can still do the majority of everything without screwing up (too bad - if you don't count her personal life).  Some partial spoilers - nothing huge.  This season she actually somewhat tried to cut back on the drugs and more or less straighten up to a certain degree but in true Jackie fashion - not happening.  Her personal life is all over the board and when she has a chance to come clean at the end - she of course doesn't!

1352810,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B003L77GS8,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[13, 21]","I enjoyed this season but I can't say I was totally knocked out by it. Perhaps the aspect I enjoyed the most was that it became increasingly difficult to tell which of Jackie's problems came first.  Specifically, she has a great deal of trouble being a wife and mother on a day in and day out basis.  Was it a big mistake for her to try and meld herself to those roles?  (Of course, the pressure to do so in our society is enormous.) So I had to start asking myself: is this woman's primary problem substance abuse or is she self medicating in order to get her through the day in living a life to which she cannot adapt? She is well cut out for being a nurse and I got the sense that if she just did the nursing with no family, she might cope a heck of a lot better.I also know that the question I've just posed is very controversial within the substance abuse community.  There is one camp which views it as a separate disease in and of itself and that emotional and mental health problems are a side issue.  Then there is the mental health community which takes a more holistic view, that the person has a serious overall mental health problem which needs addressing, that she isn't ""just"" a substance abuser.Now, if all of the above had been played out in a drama, enhancing the conflict for max impact, this would be a five star season for me.  The problem for me is that the show flirts with this serious dramatic conflict but in the end would prefer to be viewed as comedy. That is how the show is classed and how it competes come Emmy time.  Yes, there are comedic moments, the statues in the chapel, much beloved by the hospital administrator, are first removed and then returned as Cooper tries to get married with comic panache.  Also, that same character's obsession with Michelle Obama and the childhood obesity cause are pretty funny too.But in the end I would really like to explore her drug issues, her issues with her daughters and her husband, her affair and now friendship with Eddie and so forth.  They are what really interest me.  However, if you prefer the comedy slant, then this season may be worth five stars to you.  It comes down to a matter of individual preference.",4,Chicken or the Egg?

But this third go-round has left me torn. One on hand, I love Edie Falco's portrayal. Somehow she's managed to take a lying, thieving, drug-addicted adulteress and turn her into a complex but endearing and enjoyable character--someone I want to spend time with. I suppose it's because the writers show off her humanity in the dramatic hospital scenes, but the point is I LIKE HER.The problem with the series at this point is that it's become a one-trick pony and is stagnant. They need to pull a ""Weeds"" and really shake this show up a bit, even if it means getting her out of All Saints and bringing in new supporting characters. Falco and the cast are doing an amazing job but the writers are letting them down.This season still has a few amusing and surprising moments as in the Rat episode and when Jackie's 'sponsor' gets what's coming to him.Still enjoyable, but definitely getting stale already and that's a damn shame.

1352834,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B003L77GS8,Lee Armstrong,"[0, 0]","""Nurse Jackie Season 3"" keeps up the heady pace from the first two seasons.  We have the addition of ""temp nurse"" Kelly Slater played by Gbenga Akinnagbe, a foil for Jackie Peyton.  The last episode with Kelly & Jackie in the bar ends with a Falco's first belly laugh on the show.  Edie Falco is amazing, playing the complexities of Jackie Peyton with subtly & believability.  Steve Buscemi's brother Michael continues his appearances as God, the neighbor who berates pedestrians from his upstairs apartment window, being befriended by Zoey.  One of the highlights of the show is the amazing guest stars they bring on.  The legendary Marian Seldes guest stars on the episode ""When the Saints Go"" as a 97-year-old society woman relegated to a nursing home that will give her fruit juice, but refuses her a glass of sherry -- which Dr. O'Hara tries to prescribe.  Seldes is a veteran Broadway actress who won a Tony in 1967 for Edward Albee's ""A Delicate Balance.""  The depth of performance in her small cameo is breathtaking.  Bill Sage continues his reoccurring role as the drug dealer Bill until an unexpected turn of events.  Eve Best expands the range of Dr. O'Hara's character, as we see her dealing with trying to heal her relationship with Jackie.  Paul Schulze who plays Eddie gives her an ultimate compliment in the DVD extras saying that Best always begins a take in the middle of doing something; we always believe we're just dropping in on moments in her day.  The relationship with Jackie's husband Kevin fractures as there is a reversal in our expectation of what is to happen in a big dramatic moment.  This 12-episode Blue Ray disc is a handsome package with a show that is eminently re-watchable as a favorite rainy day series.

It meanders around the drama of Jackie's affairs and drug addiction that are ever present - as they have been since Season 1.  The show has run out of life and none of the characters contain much appeal anymore, if they ever once did.  I don't know if the Directors are even trying to make Jackie appealing anymore.  If so, they're doing a poor job.The supporting cast are made up of characters who remain relatively flat and underdeveloped.  Zoe, the bunny-uniform nurse, remains somewhat annoying and plain.  The hospital administrator, who is supposed to provide comic relief, comes off as more annoying than anything most of the time.  O'Hara, the British ER Doctor who is by far the strongest character on the show, is underutilized.  Then there's the other ER Doctor ""Coop"", who has lesbian parents and is supposed to be comical in his ambition to be the head ER doctor but comes off as just another flatly drawn prototypical what-hollywood-thinks-of-us type character.  And then there's Jackie's husband and her pharmacy tech boyfriend - neither one of whom are particularly sympathetic.  Watching that sub-plot causes me to wonder if we live in a society that holds anything sacred anymore.I will probably finish Season 3 for closure but will probably not watch beyond this season.  Edie Falco has done good work in the past, and there's no problem with production values or acting - but there's only so far an audience can relate to her character in my opinion - at least I hope that's the case.  Time to put this one out of it's misery.  ""Breaking Bad"", ""Dexter"", ""The Sopranos"", and ""Oz"" are all much more original and enjoyable.  The writers of this one have some work to do if they want to save the ship.  The fact that this has been out for a while but only has 8 reviews as of today suggests many have given up on the show already.Production and acting - 4 starsWriting, plot, and character development - 2 stars",3,Show is going nowhere after 3 seasons.,1357171200,"01 3, 2013",2013,2111,"['Okay', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'show', 'when', 'first', 'started', 'gave', 'chance', 'am', '2', 'seasons', '+', '7', 'episodes', 'show', 'life', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'direction', 'drama', 'Jackie', 'affairs', 'drug', 'addiction', 'are', 'ever', 'present', 'have', 'been', 'Season', '1', 'show', 'run', 'life', 'none', 'characters', 'contain', 'much', 'appeal', 'anymore', 'ever', 'once', 'did', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Directors', 'are', 'even', 'trying', 'make', 'Jackie', 'appealing', 'anymore', 'so', ""'re"", 'doing', 'poor', 'job.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'are', 'made', 'characters', 'who', 'remain', 'relatively', 'flat', 'underdeveloped', 'Zoe', 'bunny-uniform', 'nurse', 'somewhat', 'annoying', 'plain', 'hospital', 'administrator', 'who', 'supposed', 'provide', 'comic', 'relief', 'off', 'more', 'annoying', 'anything', 'most', 'time', ""O'Hara"", 'British', 'ER', 'Doctor', 'who', 'far', 'strongest', 'character', 'show', 'underutilized', 'Then', 'other', 'ER', 'Doctor', 'Coop', 'who', 'lesbian', 'parents', 'supposed', 'be', 'comical', 'ambition', 'be', 'head', 'ER', 'doctor', 'off', 'as', 'just', 'flatly', 'drawn', 'prototypical', 'what-hollywood-thinks-of-us', 'type', 'character', 'then', 'Jackie', 'husband', 'pharmacy', 'tech', 'boyfriend', 'one', 'whom', 'are', 'particularly', 'sympathetic', 'Watching', 'sub-plot', 'causes', 'wonder', 'live', 'society', 'anything', 'sacred', 'anymore.I', 'will', 'probably', 'finish', 'Season', '3', 'closure', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'watch', 'season', 'Edie', 'Falco', 'done', 'good', 'work', 'past', 'problem', 'production', 'values', 'acting', 'only', 'so', 'far', 'audience', 'can', 'relate', 'character', 'opinion', 'least', 'hope', 'case', 'Time', 'put', 'one', 'out', 'misery', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'Dexter', 'Sopranos', 'Oz', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'original', 'enjoyable', 'writers', 'one', 'have', 'work', 'do', 'want', 'save', 'ship', 'fact', 'been', 'out', 'while', 'only', '8', 'reviews', 'today', 'many', 'have', 'given', 'up', 'show', 'already.Production', 'acting', '4', 'starsWriting', 'plot', 'character', 'development', '2', 'stars']",N/A
