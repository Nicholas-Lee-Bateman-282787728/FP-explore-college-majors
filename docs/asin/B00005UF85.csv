The advice given in this film stinks. Three of the main characters didn't seem to respect women. Glen Plummer's character seemed to be the most intelligent of the four. He loved his woman but she had issues. All of the men except Howard seemed to have been hurt by a woman in the past and as a result they no longer trusted women. Howard portrayed an ice cold player. Plummer had a hot girlfriend but never asked her to marry him. This caused problems in the relationship. The lighting was poor and at times the sound was low. I couldn't enjoy the film because there was so much hateful nonsense directed at women. Plummer played a sensitive man with a sexy girlfriend. I felt for him and wanted him to get back with his woman. The ending was unexpected but realistic. Difficult relationships often end violently. Only players and men who have no respect for women will enjoy this film. Die hard fans of Mr. Howard will enjoy seeing him play yet another bad boy.

Now you know how a lot of black men feel after watching movies like Waiting to Exhale.Honestly, this movie shows how a lot of us black men kick it when we get together.  If you open your mind instead of taking the movie personal, you will see our pains and issues in our relationships and why we act the way we do.The movie takes on four different relationships from four different brotha's and their perspectives.

He drives the movie.  He's the tough bad boy with nothing nice to say, but he keeps the movie one fourth decent and interesting. The other characters are dull and uncomplicated.  They also lack acting ability.The movie did shed some light and put into SOME perspective on how men think regarding women and relationships.  It seems as though, both men and women think each are just full of it and always have an ulterior motive for wanting to be with one another.  But this movie showed how neither men nor women want to communicate their true feelings or just be honest about what they want from jump street.  In all, unspoken words and misdirected actions help ensued massive amounts of confusion throughout dating and relationships as this movie showed.I wouldn't recommend this movie to be watched for its production, but if one must watch it...watch it for its message regarding black men and their thought processes.",1,Very low budget...,1138838400,"02 2, 2006",2006,1067,"['Love', 'Beat', 'Hell', 'Outta', 'Me', 'cheesy', 'low', 'budget', 'production.However', 'said', 'best', 'character', 'was', 'Chris', 'played', 'Terrance', 'Howard', 'movie', 'tough', 'bad', 'boy', 'nothing', 'nice', 'say', 'movie', 'one', 'fourth', 'decent', 'interesting', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'dull', 'uncomplicated', 'also', 'lack', 'acting', 'ability.The', 'movie', 'did', 'shed', 'light', 'put', 'SOME', 'perspective', 'how', 'men', 'think', 'regarding', 'women', 'relationships', 'men', 'women', 'think', 'are', 'just', 'full', 'always', 'have', 'ulterior', 'motive', 'wanting', 'be', 'one', 'movie', 'showed', 'how', 'men', 'women', 'want', 'communicate', 'true', 'feelings', 'just', 'be', 'honest', 'what', 'want', 'jump', 'street', 'unspoken', 'words', 'misdirected', 'actions', 'help', 'ensued', 'massive', 'amounts', 'confusion', 'dating', 'relationships', 'movie', 'showed.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'be', 'watched', 'production', 'one', 'must', 'watch', 'watch', 'message', 'regarding', 'black', 'men', 'thought', 'processes']",Love Beat the Hell Outta Me
