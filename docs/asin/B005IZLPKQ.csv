I'm gonna make this kinda short and say that the main problem I had with this movie was that there was a lot of talking and explaining stuff (lots of these superhero movies are so serious at times lately!) and NOT ENOUGH ACTION. Where was it? Sure there is a pretty girl at Captain America's side and for anyone who cares, Captain America is played by the hottie Chris Evans who is seen shirtless a few times so there's that part of it. But to me there just wasn't enough fighting and fast-paced things going on in this mostly slower-moving movie. The action that did take place was fine and the scene where he is trying to escape a place that will soon explode with a friend was very gripping and kept my attention, but honestly there wasn't that much to work with here.

Directed by Joe Johnston and starring a surprisingly heroic Chris Evans in the title role, Captain America plays out the origin story of Steve Rogers, a scrawny but determined military recruit who signs up for a secret super-soldier program, only to be faced by the threat of the evil HYDRA organization and its leader Red Skull, another recipient of the super-soldier treatment. Though I was initially a bit unsure what exactly to expect from the film, I enjoyed it. It's solidly old-fashioned blockbuster entertainment with pulpy action, a retro vibe, and some fine acting performances.

Filled with one liners and rushed sub plots, this movie has explosions! It literally starts with the end and then spends the rest of the movie explaining how it got there. And then it ends. I didn't have time to connect or fall in love with any of the characters I'm supposed to empathize with. And the allied soldiers have such a hard time fighting the germans until captain america shows up, then its a complete cake walk, even for 400 soldiers to sneak up to the red skull's secret lair.The part that really takes the cake is how the movie seems to overreach in an obvious attempt to paint women in a better light. Not only is a woman second lieutenant but also the one leading the charge at the end. And really in the entire US Army they couldn't find anyone else for the most important battle of the war? Are there only 5 heads fighting WWII that keep rotating roles? And seriously, all Peggy Carter does is disobey orders and tell Steve Rogers to go ahead and do things that would get any normal man killed. In an era where women had just gained the right to vote, it would be like a civil war story in which an african american was Lincoln's secretary of state.So in short, no, it was not a good movie.*spoilers* oh and the red skull gets a hold of the cube of odin and what does he do with it?

1462108,A2JDYUSI2RILEB,B005IZLPKQ,Andre Dursin,"[1, 2]","Colorful, nostalgic and splendidly executed on many fronts, CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE FIRST AVENGER ranks with the most satisfying comic-book movies to date.Joe Johnston, who did such a fine job helming Disney's underrated WWII-period genre film ""The Rocketeer"" some 20 years ago, was the right choice to bring Marvel's patriotic hero to the screen in a confident, satisfying film that hits every note from its first frame to nearly its last.Chris Evans makes for a perfect Steve Rogers, the tough kid from Brooklyn whose motivation and courage are unfortunately not matched by his scrawny, weak body - one that prevents him from serving Uncle Sam in WWII. Rogers is continually rejected for service until his determination is noted by scientist Stanley Tucci, working for the U.S. military and who sees in Rogers the perfect candidate for their new Super Soldier program, spearheaded in part by brilliant Howard Stark (Dominic Cooper, playing none other than Tony ""Iron Man"" Stark's father).Rogers' transformation, though, at first applies mostly off the field of battle, with Captain America serving as a USO salesman for war bonds (there's a wonderful musical montage set to an original Alan Menken-David Zippel song). Much to the consternation of gruff colonel Tommy Lee Jones, Rogers eventually presses his way into service, saving an Allied troop from certain death at the hands of HYDRA, a Nazi off-shoot presided over by the evil Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving). Schmidt has not only been previously transformed by Tucci's doctor into the vile Red Skull, but has also corralled one of Odin's energy cubes and created a new destructive weapon that threatens the future of the entire world.""Captain America"" does dial down the particulars of its war-time setting so as to not feel like too much of an ""all-American"" story, replacing any overt feelings of rah-rah patriotism with an overriding message that Rogers is a hero not because of his nationality so much as his courage and heart instead (as he tells Tucci's scientist at the beginning, Cap ""doesn't want to kill anyone"" but can't stand ""bullies""). It's a decision that ultimately works, managing to make the picture more appealing to foreign markets while not turning the material into a completely toothless, ""Politically Corrected"" portrayal of the character either (a gambit that paid off with the movie having grossed $365 million worldwide, slightly more than half overseas).Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely's script confidently profiles Cap's dogged pursuit of the Skull with just a hint of romance (British newcomer Hayley Atwell is fetching as Peggy Carter), though supporting roles for the likes of Sebastian Stan (as Cap's sidekick Bucky) and Neal McDonough (one of the ""Howling Commandos"") come off as if they've been reduced in the editing room. Johnston's fondness for the material, though, is always evident, marked by crisply-edited action scenes that bring the vintage Marvel comics to life. Technically the movie is graced by an occasionally rousing Alan Silvestri score (his end credits ""March"" is just great) and cinematography by Shelly Johnson that was done no favors by the movie's 3-D exhibitions, which darkened an already limited visual pallet that overly accentuated green-screen.If there's one disappointment with ""Captain America,"" it's that the film works so well, it's a letdown when the material moves into the present day for its inevitable ""Avengers"" set-up in its concluding moments - making one surmise that if there is a sequel, it's not going to involve the period setting and supporting characters from this exciting ""Cap"" to the year's super-hero efforts. (Perhaps some kind of time-travel device can send Steve back to the `40s?)Paramount brings ""Captain America"" to Blu-Ray and 3-D Blu-Ray this week in a number of different variants, including a limited-edition three-disc bundle. The 3-D for the movie is well-handled for the most part with depth-of-field effects, yet as I mentioned before, the cinematography is dulled even further from its standard appearance so I would recommend the 2-D version instead. The DTS MA soundtrack is dynamic throughout.Extras include five minutes of deleted scenes in HD with incomplete special effects that fans will find of interest, including a different introduction to the Howling Commandos and a longer ending. Seven Making Of featurettes give a slick, mostly promotional-type look behind the scenes while there's another brief, amusing ""Marvel One Shot"" with Special Agent Caulson (Clark Gregg) set in between this picture and ""Thor.""

1462109,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B005IZLPKQ,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 1]","I want to say this.  I am firmly convinced that Chris Evans IS a super hero.  Sadly, he isn't much of an actor, and it shows in this film.  He just isn't convincing as a person, constantly displaced from the people around him (especially the stunning Hayley Atwell, who can actually act her butt off here).  Honestly though, Chris Evans is the least of this film's problems.`Captain America: The First Avenger' suffers from trying to do too much without placing it firmly in focus.  It opens VERY strong, establishing young sickly Steve Rogers' backstory very well.  As an origin story, this film gets it and it works it beautifully.  This is aided by the beautiful production design, recreating an era and a place that consumes every frame.  From the costumes to the set pieces to the brilliantly cloaked cinematography, `Captain America' promises to be amazing.  Sadly, after Steve Rogers makes his transformation and his first heroic act the film loses its footing.  This comes from rapid segments that feel like an excuse to show pointless action sequences.  There is no meat in these scenes.  Secondly, the reveal of Hugo Weaving's villain seems kind of anticlimactic (why does he wait so long to show his comrades something he doesn't seem so intent of hiding anyways).  All of these elements create a second half that drags pretty badly.  The film wares out its welcome before it is half over.Still, some of the scenes are expertly crafted, and the technical elements at play here are nicely composed (making Chris Evans a scrawny little twig of a man is not only mind-blowing but believable) but in the end, this is a film that only `half' works.

I appreciated the performances, humor and character development more, and after seeing ""The Avengers"" and then re-watching this film I had more appreciation for the tie-in with that blockbuster.  It also tied in nicely with the ""Iron Man"" films (don't want to say how or that might spoil it for some).  However, the pace of this film was a bit on the slow side for my taste, and I didn't really care for Steve Rogers' merry band of soldiers or Red Skull.  (The same type of serum that turned Rogers into a super soldier turned another guy's head red and made his nose fall off? What's up with that?)The visual effects used to reduce Chris Evans from his usual pumped up, muscular self to a 90-lb. weakling were amazing, and the effects were good throughout most of the film.  However, there were a couple of scenes where I thought the effects still needed some work, like the flying wing and few moments that looked like the actors were standing in front of green screens.Anyway, there were some funny moments and good action scenes, and the HD and 7.1 presentation was great.  The 3D effects were disappointing though.  This wasn't really a surprise given the fact that the movie was filmed in 2D and converted to 3D in post production.  The titles and main menu utilized the 3D gimmick well, but not much else.One question remains though: why does Captain America bother to wear a cowl when the world knows his identity?

1462117,A1YZMGEC9ELI4L,B005IZLPKQ,"A.P. Fuchs, author of The Axiom-man Saga ""www...","[0, 0]","It's World War II and the US Army needs to up its game in its war against the villainous Nazis under the command of Adolf Hitler.Enter Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), a little guy from Brooklyn with all sorts of health problems, but who has possibly the strongest sense of morals and courage than any man on the front line. Unfortunately, due to his fragility, Steve is not allowed to join the American army despite multiple tries. A scientist experimenting in a super soldier serum for the US army notices this and offers him a chance to take part in a dangerous procedure that, if it goes well, will grant Steve superhuman-like abilities and enable him to be an ultimate man, athlete and warrior. Steve accepts and transforms into the world's first super soldier: Captain America.Meanwhile, the first test subject of the serum, Johann Schmidt-aka the Red Skull (Hugo Weaving)-has come into possession of the Tesseract cube, a powerful energy source rumored to be from Asgard. His plan? Nothing less than overthrowing Hitler himself and taking over the world.If only we had a super soldier to stop him. Wait . . . we do.His name is Captain America.Like all good fanboys, I saw this movie in the theatre. Having grown up on the cheesy Captain America movies starring Reb Brown and, later, the 1990 version with Matt Salinger, a part of me, I admit, was waiting for a repeat of the 1990 film (in the general sense). I was more interested in how Captain America: The First Avenger would tie into the then upcoming Avengers and this movie didn't disappoint.The introduction of the Tesseract-which would be key in Avengers-was real smart on the filmmakers' part because not only did it point to the forthcoming ensemble film, but also gave a quick link to the Thor movie as well.Watching Chris Evans as Steve Rogers was fantastic. He really suits the role and played it perfectly. I wasn't sure how the once Human Torch-all witty and sarcastic-would fare as the famous super soldier, and I'm glad Chris Evans proved he can play a kind of Superman-like character as well. Seeing him play both the small, frail Steve Rogers (facially, anyway, as someone else's body was used), to playing the suped-up Steve made the film truly a story about how our greatest power lies within as opposed to externally.Likewise, Hugo Weaving as Red Skull did a great job, especially since playing villains is no strange task to Weaving (Agent Smith, anyone?). Even with the German haircut he looked different never mind later when his red skull visage was revealed.The story was simple and, like the first Spider-Man movie, I left the theatre underwhelmed. After seeing it a second time, I saw it for what it was and really enjoyed it. Unfortunately, the end battle was anti-climatic. It didn't need to be an all-out brawl between Cap and Red Skull, but it felt brief considering these two are the heads and tails of the same coin. Some sort of super soldier/titan clash would have punched up the ending. Speaking of which, the ending of this movie has one of the best last lines to a flick ever. It was the kind of line I try to end my own novels on, one that finishes the tale but also has a punch to it.As far as superhero stories go, the World War II setting gave the genre a breath of fresh air movie-wise as, thus, far, pretty much every super flick to come out recently is all set in the modern day. Alternate times and/or worlds with a superhero figure are few and far between. The Spirit is the only one that comes to mind in this regard.After this movie and Avengers, I'm excited to see Captain America: Winter Soldier, which is presently set for 2014.",4,Captain America Throws His Mighty Shield!,1359244800,"01 27, 2013",2013,3634,"['World', 'War', 'II', 'US', 'Army', 'up', 'game', 'war', 'villainous', 'Nazis', 'command', 'Adolf', 'Hitler.Enter', 'Steve', 'Rogers', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'little', 'guy', 'Brooklyn', 'sorts', 'health', 'problems', 'who', 'possibly', 'strongest', 'sense', 'morals', 'courage', 'man', 'front', 'line', 'Unfortunately', 'due', 'fragility', 'Steve', 'not', 'allowed', 'join', 'American', 'army', 'multiple', 'tries', 'scientist', 'experimenting', 'super', 'soldier', 'serum', 'US', 'army', 'notices', 'chance', 'take', 'part', 'dangerous', 'procedure', 'well', 'will', 'grant', 'Steve', 'superhuman-like', 'abilities', 'enable', 'be', 'ultimate', 'man', 'athlete', 'warrior', 'Steve', 'accepts', 'transforms', 'world', 'first', 'super', 'soldier', 'Captain', 'America.Meanwhile', 'first', 'test', 'subject', 'serum', 'Johann', 'Schmidt-aka', 'Red', 'Skull', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'come', 'possession', 'Tesseract', 'cube', 'powerful', 'energy', 'source', 'rumored', 'be', 'Asgard', 'plan', 'Nothing', 'less', 'overthrowing', 'Hitler', 'taking', 'over', 'world.If', 'only', 'had', 'super', 'soldier', 'stop', 'Wait', 'do.His', 'name', 'Captain', 'America.Like', 'good', 'fanboys', 'saw', 'movie', 'theatre', 'Having', 'grown', 'up', 'cheesy', 'Captain', 'America', 'movies', 'starring', 'Reb', 'Brown', 'later', '1990', 'version', 'Matt', 'Salinger', 'part', 'admit', 'was', 'waiting', 'repeat', '1990', 'film', 'general', 'sense', 'was', 'more', 'interested', 'how', 'Captain', 'America', 'First', 'Avenger', 'would', 'tie', 'then', 'upcoming', 'Avengers', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'disappoint.The', 'introduction', 'Tesseract-which', 'would', 'be', 'key', 'Avengers-was', 'real', 'smart', 'filmmakers', 'part', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'point', 'forthcoming', 'ensemble', 'film', 'also', 'gave', 'quick', 'link', 'Thor', 'movie', 'well.Watching', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'Steve', 'Rogers', 'was', 'fantastic', 'really', 'suits', 'role', 'played', 'perfectly', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'how', 'once', 'Human', 'Torch-all', 'witty', 'sarcastic-would', 'fare', 'famous', 'super', 'soldier', ""'m"", 'glad', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'proved', 'can', 'play', 'kind', 'Superman-like', 'character', 'well', 'Seeing', 'play', 'small', 'frail', 'Steve', 'Rogers', 'facially', 'anyway', 'someone', 'else', 'body', 'was', 'used', 'playing', 'suped-up', 'Steve', 'made', 'film', 'truly', 'story', 'how', 'greatest', 'power', 'opposed', 'externally.Likewise', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'Red', 'Skull', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'especially', 'playing', 'villains', 'strange', 'task', 'Weaving', 'Agent', 'Smith', 'anyone', 'Even', 'German', 'haircut', 'looked', 'different', 'never', 'mind', 'later', 'when', 'red', 'skull', 'visage', 'was', 'revealed.The', 'story', 'was', 'simple', 'first', 'Spider-Man', 'movie', 'left', 'theatre', 'underwhelmed', 'seeing', 'second', 'time', 'saw', 'what', 'was', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Unfortunately', 'end', 'battle', 'was', 'anti-climatic', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'all-out', 'brawl', 'Cap', 'Red', 'Skull', 'felt', 'brief', 'considering', 'two', 'are', 'heads', 'tails', 'same', 'coin', 'sort', 'super', 'soldier/titan', 'clash', 'would', 'have', 'punched', 'up', 'ending', 'Speaking', 'ending', 'movie', 'one', 'best', 'last', 'lines', 'flick', 'ever', 'was', 'kind', 'line', 'try', 'end', 'own', 'novels', 'one', 'tale', 'also', 'punch', 'it.As', 'far', 'superhero', 'stories', 'go', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'setting', 'gave', 'genre', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'movie-wise', 'thus', 'far', 'pretty', 'much', 'super', 'flick', 'come', 'out', 'recently', 'set', 'modern', 'day', 'Alternate', 'times', 'and/or', 'worlds', 'superhero', 'figure', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'Spirit', 'only', 'one', 'mind', 'regard.After', 'movie', 'Avengers', ""'m"", 'excited', 'see', 'Captain', 'America', 'Winter', 'Soldier', 'presently', 'set', '2014']",N/A

The movie is wonderful -- but I found myself confused.That is, until I rented Captain America when many of the most confusing parts of The Avengers suddenly became much more clear.Set during WWII, Captain America is about Steve Rogers, a young man from Brooklyn the military refuses to enlist -- no matter how many times he tries.  That is until a military scientist gives Rogers his chance to serve -- if he qualifies for and agrees to being part of a top secret experiment.  That experiment transforms Rogers into Captain America, giving Rogers the chance to make a difference he's waited for all his life.In this movie, a lot of pieces from The Avengers becomes clear.  You meet Howard Stark (Iron Man Tony Stark's father), are introduced to the Terresect, and see how Rogers becomes encased in the ice we first see him in at the start of The Avengers.  You also come to really understand the Iron Man verses Captain America dynamic so brilliantly played between Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr as all the references in their banter come into focus.Essential for any Avengers fan.One caveat for those not familiar with 1940s America:  the movie is rich with the American patriot hype and propaganda that was so much a part of 1940s American culture.  It can come off as over the top if you do not know much about this time period -- but is absolutely true to period.",4,"Essential to understanding ""The Avengers""",1395705600,"03 25, 2014",2014,1496,"['Avengers', 'new', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'franchise', 'bringing', 'together', 'best', 'brightest', 'Marvel', 'universe', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'found', 'confused.That', 'rented', 'Captain', 'America', 'when', 'many', 'most', 'confusing', 'parts', 'Avengers', 'suddenly', 'became', 'much', 'more', 'clear.Set', 'WWII', 'Captain', 'America', 'Steve', 'Rogers', 'young', 'man', 'Brooklyn', 'military', 'refuses', 'enlist', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'military', 'scientist', 'Rogers', 'chance', 'serve', 'being', 'part', 'top', 'secret', 'experiment', 'experiment', 'Rogers', 'Captain', 'America', 'giving', 'Rogers', 'chance', 'make', 'difference', 'waited', 'life.In', 'movie', 'lot', 'pieces', 'Avengers', 'becomes', 'clear', 'meet', 'Howard', 'Stark', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'father', 'are', 'introduced', 'Terresect', 'see', 'how', 'Rogers', 'encased', 'ice', 'first', 'see', 'start', 'Avengers', 'also', 'come', 'really', 'understand', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Captain', 'America', 'so', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr', 'references', 'banter', 'come', 'focus.Essential', 'Avengers', 'fan.One', 'caveat', 'not', 'familiar', '1940s', 'America', 'movie', 'rich', 'American', 'patriot', 'hype', 'propaganda', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'part', '1940s', 'American', 'culture', 'can', 'come', 'off', 'top', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'much', 'time', 'period', 'absolutely', 'true', 'period']",N/A

1462127,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B005IZLPKQ,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[3, 4]","Norway, 1942. A Nazi special weapons division commanded by Johann Schmidt secures an ancient artifact of unknown origin but incredible power, which they hope to use to power a new, more advanced war machine. At the same time, in New York City, Steve Rogers is rejected from joining the US Army due to a significant number of health issues. Frustrated, he tries to falsify documents in order to enlist. Impressed by his tenacity, Dr. Abraham Erskine instead recruits him for a top-secret programme, designed to create the ultimate soldier using technology. Rogers becomes Captain America, just as Schmidt (adopting the alias, 'the Red Skull') breaks away from his Nazi masters to undertake his own mission of destruction and world domination.Captain America: The First Avenger is yet another piece in Marvel's 'cinematic masterplan', of tying together different characters into a single coherent universe. This plan - which also incorporates Thor, The Incredible Hulk and the two Iron Man movies - culminates in The Avengers, which recently hit cinemas. With Captain America, Marvel resist the urge to bring the character immediately into the present, instead giving him a full origin story set in WWII. This sets the film apart from its contemporaries and allows Rogers' patriotism to be established in full at a time of good vs. evil before bringing him into the murkier present.The film is anchored on Chris Evans's performance as Rogers/Captain America (Evans previously played the Human Torch in the two Fantastic Four movies), which is decent. A problem with the Captain America character is that unabashed American patriotism isn't a concept that travels well abroad. However, taking a nod from the comics where the same issue has come up a few times over the years, Evans plays the character as a good man who wants to do his part and isn't a blind follower of American policy. Later in the film the character becomes based in London and leads an international team of agents in taking the fight to the Red Skull, mixing things up in a more interesting manner. A combination of Evans's performance and impressive CGI also totally sells the illusion of the puny, short and unhealthy Rogers in the opening sequences of the film before his transformation into the buff Captain America.Other performances are good, with director Joe Johnston opting for safe and reliable actors in many of the roles: Tommy Lee Jones plays a brash US general who gets the best lines in the movie (as may be expected), with Stanley Tucci bringing eccentricity and humanity to the role of Erskine. Hugo Weaving as the Red Skull and Toby Jones as his sidekick Dr. Zola also form a solid double-act (though Weaving occasionally slips into 'auto-pilot evil', this being a role he could do in is sleep). Hayley Atwell provides solid support as British agent Peggy Carter. The potential for saying something interesting as a British female agent working alongside square-jawed American soldiers in wartime is squandered, however, with Carter characterised as a 'plucky British gal' and not developed much further beyond punching out a solider who makes a sexist comment before she falls for the hero. The ever-reliable Neal McDonough also appears as one of Rogers's international team of agents, though aside from a truly outrageous moustache he is not very distinguishable from the very similar roles he's played before on Band of Brothers and Minority Report.The film adopts a cool retrofuturistic (or 'Americanapunk') tone at times, with Johnston clearly tapping the same well as his entertaining early-career picture, The Rocketeer. There's a playful sense of humour at times, and Captain America deserves some plaudits for being the first contemporary superhero movie to transform into a musical for ten minutes halfway through (rationalised in the storyline). However, its musings on patriotism, warfare and heroism rarely rise above the predictable. The plot is pretty straightforward, although well-paced with some good action sequences. The links to the rest of the Marvel cinematic universe are downplayed to a few appearances by Tony Stark's father and the now-traditional appearance of Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury in the movie's closing moments (interestingly, in the actual finale of the movie rather than a post-credits sequence). This allows the movie to stand alone as an independent piece of entertainment.The film's biggest problem is a total lack of surprise or tension. It's a solidly-made piece of entertainment which relies on its period setting as its sole distinguishing feature from its contemporaries. The actors and director all do good work and it certainly passes the time enjoyably enough, but it lacks long-term appeal.Captain America: The First Avenger (***) is available now in the UK (DVD, Blu-Ray) and USA (DVD, Blu-Ray).

1462128,A1DZU4AQR7KD9R,B005IZLPKQ,"Axton Blessendon, Jr.","[0, 0]","-----------------------------------------------------""Captain America""  (2011)-----------------------------------------------------Note: spoilers below-----------------------------------------------------This ""Captain America"" film has been hailed as the best-est comicbook movie ever: I would say that it's certainly in the top five, and it's pretty good, though there is room to nitpick. It tells the story of Captain America's origin well and telescopes his WWII career into what looks like one big adventure.  This last detail is problematic for me: although there is an action montage which suggests other adventures that could be set in the 1940s, for some reason they bend the original boyscout origin into a scenario that has Steve (Captain America) Rogers sidelined from the action doing USO tours and war bond shows instead of cracking heads on the front lines: he has to prove himself to his cranky, old-school commanding officer Tommy Lee Jones first. Which is fine, except they also have as the climax of the film the semi-death of Captain America: one big battle and then he's literally frozen on ice until thawing out decades later. So... then how does he become the iconic WWII legend that all other Marvel heroes live in awe of??Once again, Hollywood undercuts its own superhero franchise by cramming too much into one movie. They could've skipped the neutered-hero subplot, then shown glimpses of numerous other battles and *then* had his big showdown with the Red Skull, but oh no, that would have been too much like the comicbooks. Oh, and did I mention that they also (apparently) killed off the Red Skull as well? I'm guessing he comes back via magic, but they made it look like he burned to a crisp? Why? Why ""kill"" the hero's arch-nemesis in the first film? Why does Hollywood keep doing this? It's unnecessary and it damages the long-term prospects for building a series of movies around the hero. And why grind your way through so many plot points?  Give the story room to breathe, and the franchise room to grow - don't burn so many bridges right away.To be fair, this ""Captain America"" is much better in this regard than other super-movies and is generally quite enjoyable. I liked the depiction of the silly super-baddies in the Hydra secret army (even though there wound up being too much anachronistic high-tech weaponry in this World War II origin movie) and I thought the prologue where Cap got his powers was well-handled.  I'd like a little retconning of the retcon so that maybe we could have more WWII adventures, maybe even a little Invaders action with the Sub-Mariner and the original Human Torch (who is glimpsed briefly in this film...) Also, it would be nice to see Cap in his bright, primary-colors superhero outfit.  What's the point of wearing the old Red, White & Blue if its buried under layers of parachute straps, canteens and khaki canvas rucksacks? WTF? I know Marvel currently loves the strapped-up Captain America look, but I doubt many fans share their enthusiasm. Let's see him all bright and cartoony! Why wear the flag if you don't let it fly?Anyway, I thought this was pretty good, all thing considered. Make Mine Marvel!

After he becomes a supersoldier, because the doctor is killed by a Nazi spy. The formula is lost, leaving Rogers to be the only Super Soldier.

He doesn't really want to kill Nazis just thwart bullies. He gets his chance through the efforts of Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci,) who fattens him up a bit through injections and extreme infusions of blue light energy. Now comes the question of how will he use his newfound abilities, for good, for evil, or for frivolity?Most of us already know the story of Capt. America many of watched programs or read the comics. So we already have a preconception of how this should come about and what he should be doing as the superhero. However I suggest you set those preconceptions aside and watch the movie for what it is. You will find that it is entertaining, fast-paced yet slows down every once in a while so that Steve Rogers can look into Peggy Carter's (Hayley Atwell) eyes and wonder what it would be like if the world was different.Being a little bit on the cynical side you would almost think that this movie is really an outlet for out of work actors. We see many of our favorites and a few that may become favorites. Tommy Lee Jones looks a little bit like he might've melted in his old age but we still remember him from that fantastic movie ""Volcano."" Every time I see the bad guy okay the Crimson Skull (Hugo Weaving) I think of ""Lord of the Rings."" But it's too bad that Stanley Tucci did not get a longer part as he is a very flexible actor. You should really see Stanley in the movie ""Undercover Blues.""I only saw the Blu-ray version so I cannot comment on any peculiarities of the other versions.

1462145,A3GKMQFL05Z79K,B005IZLPKQ,blackaciddevil,"[1, 2]","Captain America: The First Avenger, in my opinion, is this summer's top superhero movie. Heck, it might even be the best movie of 2011, period. Forget X-Men: First Class, Thor or Green Lantern. I'll have to say it, when noone else will, that this has to be Marvel's best, thus far.The movie, basically, tells the origin of how Cap came to be with him going up against The Red Skull(who himself is a super soldier). There's plenty of action and the performances of the cast are top-notch and believable. Chris Evans plays Cap much better than he did as The Human Torch in Fantastic Four(which I always questioned anyhow). He's definitely more physical in this movie, with all the action he does.However, where I find fault in the movie, The Red Skull doesn't get much screen time in the movie and-for that reason- he doesn't seem to be THAT serious of a threat to me. In the comics, The Red Skull is maniacal and is hellbent on threatening all humanity and making good on it. Like the original Batman movie(by Tim Burton), I was expecting the movie to portray the villain in as close a manner as he was in the comics but was disappointed that he wasn't. I can't find fault in Hugo Weaving, though. He did an excellent job as The Red Skull. Too, the conclusion of the movie seemed awkward and forced. I find fault in Director Joe Johnston, who seemed more concerned in laying down the origin and foundation for the upcoming Avengers movie. Not that that is a bad thing as it isn't but(..). With the sequel, however, he better 1-up everything...if he wants Cap to continue as a viable movie franchise. I suggest he looks to the Iron Man movies for inspiration or bow out while the gettin' is good and let someone else give it a shot. I know that's being critical but Cap deserves better.Other than that, Captain America: The First Avenger is a great movie.

1462148,ALLVXWH9HCW2X,B005IZLPKQ,Bobo,"[1, 2]","Besides being a tremendously smart and even emotional film, it's also refreshing to see a lead hero be just that... a hero. Steve is no morbid vigalante or narcissitic self absorbed anti-hero. He's the real deal. His tough life hasn't made him bitter or jaded. In fact, it's done just the opposite. He's needed to develop character because his body didn't develop. This is the key to Cap both in the books and in the film. Heart and character trump the physical elements and are what truly makes the character itself special. Even after he's given the great gift of being a ""super soldier,"" he still continues to do the right thing. It's not to prove anything to anyone other than himself because he has a high moral code. I love the fact that they choose his character for the experiment because he wouldn't take advantage of the gift. That's smart writing. Cap's first assignment from the U.S. government is to be the centerpiece in a traveling USO show, building morale and raising money for the war effort. Eventually, he finds he's wasting his new abilities and NEEDS to break away on his own to fight the Nazi menace. This brings him to conflict with the awesomely diabolical Red Skull. The Skull is one of Marvel's best crazed villains and they captured that perfectly. Here, the Red Skull was a guinea pig for a similar Nazi super soldier experiment that went very wrong. These clashes and confrontations are everything they should be and more.  Shades of gray are great in film (and there are those tones present here) but sometimes it's good to have character of pure heart, pure integrity and true morality take it to what history and everyone knows was pure evil.  It's refreshing to sit back and root for the ultimate good to take it to the ultimate bad guys.

1462156,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B005IZLPKQ,Brian E. Erland,"[1, 2]","For me the long awaited film `Captain America: The First Avenger' about one of my favorite childhood comic book superheroes turned out to be a somewhat bittersweet experience. I probably shouldn't have expected anything less since ones expectations always surpass what one ultimately receives. You see I wanted nothing less than total immersion into an imaginary world where good and evil are plainly marked, heroes and villains wear memorable garb and the action and adventure comes at you non-stop.  Now that I think of it, a little bit of nave idealism, justified revenge and romance should be thrown in just to spice things up even more.From a technical point of view the film meets or excels all my expectations, I honestly can't find any fault with the final on-screen product. The visuals are superior, storyline solid, soundtrack memorable and the overall aura of a WWII America comingling with a surreal occult, Nazi universe is just short of miraculous. Yea, I guess I liked it. And what about the cast you ask? No problems here either. Who wouldn't love Chris Evans in the role of Captain America and immediately fall in love with Hayley Atwell in the role of the Captain's love interest Peggy Carter. Then of course there's the incredible Hugo Weaving in the role of Johann Schmidt (aka: Red Skull), Tommy Lee Jones, Stanley Tucci and Dominic Cooper as Howard Stark (Iron Man's father). There's definitely loads of quality talent throughout.At this point you might be wondering why I described my initial viewing experience as ""somewhat bittersweet"" since I've had only positive things to say about the movie. The reason is that the film disappoints on one level which for me is the most important of all. I like to call it the repeatability factor. For me the most important quality in a film is its ability to instill within the viewer the unquenchable desire to watch it over and over again. It has to be able to `click' with the audience in such a way that always leaves one panting for yet another viewing. For me `Captain America: The First Avenger' just doesn't connect with me on that level.

Only a whirlwind tour through as many high-production movies as possible will save the day.It turns out, can you believe it, that the Nazis were more completely evil than we knew.  In a genuine surprise to Adolf Hitler (and don't you wish you also saw the look on his face when he saw it from his special, high-tech moving chair, hey hey!), a German ace has developed his own evil organization, Hydra, which audaciously makes the Roman, I mean Nazi salute with, get this, both arms, and this obviously makes them TWICE as completely evil as puny Hitler's henchmen.  (In the Broadway musical version, with choreography by ""Hank"" Himmler, they goose-step with both feet.  But that is not in this movie.)  They don't even say ""Heil Hitler,"" they say ""Heil Hydra.""  That is how completely, and doubly, evil they are.The Uber-Red Red Baron has his own plans for world domination, and has kept all the wunderwaffen for himself, including stealth bombers (See Reality or Wonder Woman, whichever you prefer), pseudo-cyborgs (See that strange guy in Washington Square) in black space suits (see Star Wars), and the plan for attacking New York that even Adolf Hitler couldn't realize.  (The stealth planes with the curved-down wings are still secret however.  You're not even supposed to know about them either.  So keep your mouth shut.)  ""Uber-Red"" (see the Stargate Atlantis character ""Oberoth"") has been made into a super-soldier (See Stargate SG1) with the help of a German scientist who switched sides, so at last America stands a chance of having its own German scientist (See Ice Station Zebra).  Germany has all its wonder weapons, including, astonishingly, a super-powered square thingy (See the Star Trek Borg) and all America can do is use the German turncoat's uber-steroids to transform one, single, geek ultra-lite into one, beefcake, Greek hoplite (See Herodotus, but I think the book is better than the movie).Always keen to keep proper Capitalist priorities (See any Republican rage over ""Freedom""), the US knows just what to do with a superhero: put him on a War Bonds dancing tour with crowds of thick-legged, tiny-breasted chorus girls, in an environment where nobody puts out, some kind of stupid boring Hell for Superheroes (See Cabaret, or just drive a cab on the night shift).  Meanwhile Big Red Baddie, acted by Hugo Weaving at the top of his craft playing supernatural elves (See the Lord of the Rings), moves to become Master of the Universe (See Frank Langela, at the top of his craft playing supernatural vampires in, in fact, Master of the Universe).  The recruiter is a soldier-girl named Carter (See Stargate SG1 again, that was where we learned that soldier-girls keep their genitals on the inside!), who hasn't yet thought of carrying even one riding crop.  Apparently you are expected to opt out of noticing that she has imperfect facial doubles and that her boobs get bigger as the movie progresses - obviously in this alternative universe, the Constitutional Amendment promising Equal Steroid Opportunity has finally passed, and hey, faces can be similar, right?  So what's your problem?Captain America has his own guys to recruit, including a Negro and a Frenchman (See Hogan's Heroes).  More of an action fighter than Batman and not as super-powered as Spiderman, Captain America, played by Chris Evans, is the stud David Duchovney wishes he was.  More intuitive than most evil types, Weaving's Red Skull is the apotheosis of makeup abuse (See Planet of the Apes).  But his metamorphosis into Redness is handled in an acceptably off-the-shoulder way.  (I really think I get major points for saying so cool a thing so incredibly well.)  In a cameo at the end Samuel L. Jackson ""reprises his role as Nick Fury"" (See Way Too Many Comic Book Movies), to explain why everything is so modern after Cap America wakes up in a hospital in a later era of history than he crash-landed into in the act of saving New York at the end of his mission, and just when we think Cap's going to begin to figure things out and show signs of Capgras Syndrome, because the nurse doesn't quite look enough like his girl, this doesn't actually happen, because some smart film executive decided to make a plot theme out of the imperfect doubles.  (Probably only the Hydra fists were perfect doubles.)  (And the Goose-stepping feet in the Broadway musical that you claim you didn't know about.)  So Cap can't be surrounded by fakes of his familiars, they aren't them, they only look like them, right?  As Nick Fury, Jackson apologizes for the crazy drama, and that makes everything all right.  And I really hope this review closes the file on my interest in the First Avenger.  With the right steroids, any of us could be one.",3,And Now About Chairman Adolf Hitler's Big Surprise,1361232000,"02 19, 2013",2013,4805,"['1945', 'America', 'long', 'dark', 'night', 'comic', 'book',

""Cap"" is ""The Rocketeer"" completely drained of its essence. The structure is uncertain, the pacing sloppy, the action dull, the logic constantly questionable.This is a movie just going through the motions, but at the same time it feels like a four-hour film trimmed down to two. Motivations are unclear, questions go unanswered, introductions are set up and then never made. For example: Why have The Howling Commandos appear at all if you're not going to identify them as a unit?Probably the biggest missed opportunity is the handling of Steve Rogers, who -- thanks to a super-serum and some ""Vita-Ray"" exposure -- goes from 96 pound F-4 weakling to a strapping, totally cut uber-soldier. His ""before"" version is whiny, passive aggressive and seems a bit of a masochist (taking brutal beatings from bullies, diving onto runaway grenades); his ""after"" version never really seems the least bit disoriented, conflicted or even very excited by his transformation.

What I did not know at the time is this and several others were tying into the Avengers. Anyway I thought this movie was fantastic and seeing Chris Evans shrunk down to that small and sickly looking was amazing and it looked completely believable. Then when he stepped out of that chamber and was transformed to the absolutely ripped and super buff Cap it was something to behold. He pulls off looking like that and not being arrogant about it and he could easily act like that. He actually seems to be the wholesome and naive guy he portrays. I think he pulls it off because he is nice without being a pushover and it comes across in his acting(seen enough extra stuff to believe that, not just be a actor groupie). He is a great actor in my estimation. Hugo Weaving is always amazing in whatever he does. From Agent Smith to Megatron's voice to Red Skull he is a superb actor. I thought it was an interesting concept on how to get Captain America from the 1940's to current time. Some do not like it, but I did. I highly recommend this movie.

In essence, he's the exact opposite of what Uncle Sam is looking for.  Yet Steve just can't wait to get over to Germany and kick some Nazi butt.  A scientist (an almost unrecognizable Stanley Tucci) admires Rogers's ambition, as well as his good heart, and enlists him in a special Army program, against the wishes of Colonel Phillips (a deadpan Tommy Lee Jones).  Rogers come out of the experiment stronger and smoother, and teams up with a feisty female (tough-as-hell Hayley Atwell), his best bud (super-suave Sebastian Stan), and scientist Howard Stark (Dominic Cooper doing a dead-on Robert Downey Jr.) to take on the evil Johann Schmidt (the always-sinister Hugo Weaving) and his cohort (Toby Jones.CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE FIRST AVENGER has one solid thing going for it (no, not that god-awful title): its cast.  Everywhere is admirably cast, and while a few get underused (both Joneses, for example), and still others don't get much time to shine (Weaving is perfect when he's Schmidt, but as Red Skull, the special effects kind of get away from him), throughout these characters remain relatable and intriguing.  We genuinely root for Rogers, and though Captain America comes off as a bit of a d***** (rhymes with ""whoosh""), that could be intentional.  Director Joe Johnston knows what he's doing, at least: crafting a middle-of-the-road superhero flick, something meant to tide us over until THE AVENGERS gets here (the set-up for the latter is actually interesting; not believable or original, but interesting).It seems I'm heaping a lot of criticism on the film.  Well, I am.  But note those 4 stars.  CAPTAIN AMERICA shouldn't be taken for anything more than it is.  It's not a great comic book film; merely a good one.  But hell, that's better than so many others out there.  If nothing else, it makes the 1940s look spectacular; kudos to Johnston for knowing how to make a period piece.

1462217,A3R4794K2RVU1S,B005IZLPKQ,Danny Yu,"[1, 2]","I watched Captain America, expecting good action and a decent story. I left this movie feeling mostly satisfied with the action, character development, and love story (though not a main theme).The Hype: Many were wondering whether Chris Evans could pull of being Captain America. I would say he did an honorable job. His acting was timely, felt natural, and had some humor in the mix. He is also perfect in terms of his body (very ripped I may add). His body and delivery certainly fit the bill as Captain America. It doesn't hurt that he is handsome as well. He commands stage presence and has a solid performance. He has a few superb acting moments.The cast: A well rounded cast with some new actors/actresses in the mix. I enjoyed Tommy Lee Jones as the Colonel, Hugo Weaving as Red Skull, and Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter. Generally, most of the cast and supporting actors were solid. Soldiers casted all did a wonderful job in creating a believable atmosphere, while also blending some humor. Humor is always welcomed in action movies.My experience: The backdrop and character development of Steve Rogers (Captain America) was entertaining and timed just right. It did not feel dragged nor too short. The movie explores Steve as a puny, short, weak individual whom gets chosen to become an chemically enhanced soldier, because of his intelligence, courage, and humility. As he progressed, we are treated with a musical segment, highlighting Rogers' career as Captain America, as a performer. Moving forward, Rogers had enough of the performing career and wanted to help win the war and against Red Skull. The action was solid. Love starts to build between Captain and Peggy Carter. Though it's just a side story, it's still refreshing to see their chemistry on screen. It will be interesting to see if Captain has any internal conflicts (not being able to see Peggy again) in future Captain America installments.Overall, a well made movie with a solid cast.

1462221,A3U7ELIED4WP4R,B005IZLPKQ,Dark Faerie Tales,"[5, 7]","The Review:Chris Evans, Hugo Weaving, Tommy Lee Jones and Hayley Atwell lead the cast of Captain America: The First Avenger and it's another great movie from Marvel. Captain America finishes the trifecta of this season's excellent Marvel movies that began with Thor and X-Men: First Class. It also sets the stage for next year's Avengers film, to be helmed by BtVS and Dollhouse creator, Joss Whedon. Captain America is a comic book icon, but until now he's appeared in terrible, low budget movies. Captain America: The First Avenger is the first film actually worthy of the icon.Captain America hits all the high points for a super hero movie, while deftly avoiding the many pitfalls inherent in bringing such an iconic character to the silver screen. It's an origin story, but it doesn't get bogged down in the comic book lore. In fact it cleverly makes light of Cap's hokey comic book origins in a brilliantly self aware bit of movie making. Captain America will be and already is a great success, coming in at number 1 in its opening weekend. This is because in addition to being an action extravaganza, it's very well written and character focused. I had my doubts when I heard Chris Evans was cast in the title role, but he is the perfect Captain America or more precisely he is the perfect Steve Rogers, the incredibly frail kid from Brooklyn who goes on to become a super soldier.The first half of the movie focuses on Steve Rogers' attempts to volunteer for the U.S. Army in order to do his part to combat the Nazis during World War 2. Steve Rogers is physically unfit for service, but goes from city to city trying to sneak through the army screening process. Even though Steve Rogers is obviously patriotic, his heroic appeal runs much deeper than that. He is the eternal underdog and he naturally understands that it takes more than might to make right. His moral strength is what enables him to stand above dozens of physically stronger men and leads him to be chosen for the Super Soldier program that turns him into Captain America. The writers took an incredibly hokey origin story for the prototypical square jawed action hero and humanized Captain America to the point where Steve Rogers' alter ego takes a back seat to Steve Rogers himself.As ever, every great hero needs a great villain, and Captain America's nemesis is Johann Schmidt, aka the Red Skull. Played by Hugo Weaving, who has proven himself an amazing actor even with a mask that completely obscures his face (V for Vendetta). The Red Skull is not misunderstood. He is simply evil. If you have been paying attention to the last few films involving Avengers characters, keep a keen eye out for references to the other films in this series.Captain America: The First Avenger is every bit as good as Thor.

The reason I mentioned the Red Skull's death is I think the movie makers killing off a big bad guy in any movie slowly boxes in the writers as most super hero's only have a handful of bad guys.

1462247,A3NP3KZXLP5PG1,B005IZLPKQ,DL,"[0, 0]","These past few years we have been repeatedly smacked over the head with super hero movies. Not that it's a bad thing since I admit I have enjoyed just about all of them so far. As someone that has never been into comic books I have been able to go into these types of movies with little to no expectations other than what I had seen from the previews.Chris Evans (Fantastic Four 1, Fantastic Four 2, and Sunshine) is cast as the hero Captain America. I was a little resistant to his selection for the role at first due to him playing the Human Torch previously, but at the same time knew that he had the talent to make Captain America all that it could be. For the first quarter of the movie we see underachieving Steve Rodgers do everything in his power to get accepted into the Army. There is a very good bonus feature that describes the several different ways the studio was able to make the pre-hero Rodgers look so realistic. All the sets we see in this movie make it feel very authentic and fresh. It really looks like a lot of effort was put into making everything from the costumes, vehicles, and tech gadgets look believable for that time period (especially the Red Skull and his car!). From what I have read and been told there were some liberties taken by the studio that don't necessarily sync this movie up the comic books. From my vantage point I can't say I found any glaring problems with the movie from start to finish and was impressed with the way Stark Industries got plenty of face time.Overall, I think the casting set this movie up to be very successful. The acting is about as good as you could hope for in a comic book adaptation movie. It has plenty of heart, action, and just enough humor to keep the mood somewhat light from time to time. The bonus features were pretty good and plentiful. My only complaint would be that the Blu Ray transfer is not as sharp as I hoped for, definitely not as sharp looking as The Green Lantern or Thor. In the end this is a fun-filled couple hour escape from reality that should please most fans. 4.5/5",4,Just another masked hero movie?,1320451200,"11 5, 2011",2011,2064,"['few', 'years', 'have', 'been', 'repeatedly', 'smacked', 'head', 'super', 'hero', 'movies', 'Not', 'bad', 'thing', 'admit', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'just', 'so', 'far', 'someone', 'never', 'been', 'comic', 'books', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'go', 'types', 'movies', 'little', 'expectations', 'other', 'what', 'had', 'seen', 'previews.Chris', 'Evans', 'Fantastic', 'Four', '1', 'Fantastic', 'Four', '2', 'Sunshine', 'cast', 'hero', 'Captain', 'America', 'was', 'little', 'resistant', 'selection', 'role', 'first', 'due', 'playing', 'Human', 'Torch', 'previously', 'same', 'time', 'knew', 'had', 'talent', 'make', 'Captain', 'America', 'could', 'be', 'first', 'quarter', 'movie', 'see', 'underachieving', 'Steve', 'Rodgers', 'do', 'everything', 'power', 'get', 'accepted', 'Army', 'very', 'good', 'bonus', 'feature', 'several', 'different', 'ways', 'studio', 'was', 'able', 'make', 'pre-hero', 'Rodgers', 'look', 'so', 'realistic', 'sets', 'see', 'movie', 'make', 'feel', 'very', 'authentic', 'fresh', 'really', 'lot', 'effort', 'was', 'put', 'making', 'everything', 'costumes', 'vehicles', 'tech', 'gadgets', 'look', 'believable', 'time', 'period', 'especially', 'Red', 'Skull', 'car', 'what', 'have', 'read', 'been', 'told', 'were', 'liberties', 'taken', 'studio', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'sync', 'movie', 'up', 'comic', 'books', 'vantage', 'point', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'found', 'glaring', 'problems', 'movie', 'start', 'finish', 'was', 'impressed', 'way', 'Stark', 'Industries', 'got', 'plenty', 'face', 'time.Overall', 'think', 'casting', 'set', 'movie', 'up', 'be', 'very', 'successful', 'acting', 'as', 'good', 'could', 'hope', 'comic', 'book', 'adaptation', 'movie', 'plenty', 'heart', 'action', 'just', 'enough', 'humor', 'keep', 'mood', 'somewhat', 'light', 'time', 'time', 'bonus', 'features', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'plentiful', 'only', 'complaint', 'would', 'be', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'transfer', 'not', 'as', 'sharp', 'hoped', 'definitely', 'not', 'sharp', 'looking', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'Thor', 'end', 'fun-filled', 'couple', 'hour', 'escape', 'reality', 'should', 'please', 'most', 'fans', '4.5/5']",N/A

Thurlow,"[17, 25]","2011's ""Captain America: First Avenger"" does a nice job stitching together a superhero's World War Two origins with his future as a member of the present day Avengers, wrapped around a good period action movie with a great villain and some neat special effects.In 1942 Brooklyn, Steve Rogers (an earnest Chris Evans) is a under-sized but spunky straight-arrow kid who can't get into the military.  A quirky scientist named Erskine (Stanley Tucci) sees his potential and gets him into a secret super-soldier experiment run by the gruff Colonel Philips (Tommy Lee Jones) and his lovely English spy assistant Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell).  The experiment succeeds beyond expectations, turning Rogers into an incredibly strong, fit, and hyper-agile human being.  When a Nazi assassin kills Erskine, Rogers discovers what the audience already knows, that the Nazis have their own superhuman, the ruthless Red Skull (Hugo Weaving in snarling full Germanic mode) who has evil designs rivaling those of his boss, Adolf Hitler.Rogers is diverted to a war bonds drive as the costumed Captain America, but when he learns from Carter and Philips that his best buddy from Brooklyn is missing in action, Rogers gets into the war in a big way.  A series of action sequences set up a big finale against the Red Skull, with a bittersweet ending.  Fans are urged to hang through the credits for a nice teaser to the 2012 ""Avengers"" movie.With the exception of two brief scenes set in the future, ""Captain America"" manages a nice retro feel without drowning in nostalgia; even the high tech stuff looks period appropriate.  A brief romance between Rogers and Peggy Carter is handled with commendable and touching restraint.  A cameo by Samuel L. Jackson nicely frames the ending.

1462272,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B005IZLPKQ,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 2]","It should come as no surprise that this mid-summer 2011 entry into the Marvel Comics-originated series would be the most unabashedly old-fashioned of all the Avengers-related sagas, but what is admirable about this particular epic adventure is how committed director Joe Johnston (October Sky) and co-screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (The Chronicles of Narnia) appear to be in telling their somewhat revisionist story with such patriotic, good-versus-evil fervor on its own comic-book terms. There is nothing emotionally complex about the tale of this familiar superhero beyond a standard-issue time-travel element to bring all the Avengers storylines together. Bookended by present-day scenes, the bulk of the story focuses on our stalwart hero and his primary adversary, and how they confront each other during the height of World War II. In many respects, the film has a spiritual kinship with earlier retro-style epics likeRaiders of the Lost Arkand the 1977 version ofSuperman.The historical part of the story begins in Norway where we see renegade Nazi Johann Schmidt uncovering an extraordinary power source which he plans to use for global domination. Meanwhile back in the US, diminutive and physically weak Steve Rogers is trying desperately to serve his country in the military, but he can't get past his 4-F status. His plucky tenacity does not go unnoticed as &eacute;migr&eacute; military scientist Dr. Abraham Erskine selects him for a highly risky experiment that will transform him into a muscular soldier with superhuman strength and speed. He performs a heroic act of derring-do against a Nazi spy that throws him immediately into the spotlight, and the US government decides to use him to sell savings bonds at patriotic USO revues. However, when Steve finds out his best buddy ""Bucky"" Barnes is lost behind enemy lines, Captain America is truly born complete with his indestructible Vibranium shield. Naturally, he not only saves ""Bucky"" but the entire battalion who were given up for dead. All of this merely sets up the final showdown with the evil Schmidt, who has transformed himself into Red Skull, the super-powered head of HYDRA, the Nazi's occult research arm.While the action in the second half is well-paced and impressively choreographed, it also feels increasingly overblown when you consider how Captain America steadfastly remains a beacon of service and loyalty as a direct contrast to the megalomania of Red Skull. The finale feels anti-climactic in many ways. Already familiar to Marvel fans as the hot-headed Johnny Storm/""The Human Torch"" in theFantastic Fourmovies, Chris Evans does surprisingly well playing such an earnest character, especially the first part where CGI effects turn him into the classic 98-pound weakling. Hugo Weaving has a field day as Schmidt, even if his character's motivations start to come across as simplistic. Other actors fare just as well if somewhat predictably given the lack of true dimension they are given to play - Toby Jones (Truman Capote inInfamous) as HYDRA's No. 2, Dr. Arnim Zola; Stanley Tucci as the slyly supportive Erskine; and Tommy Lee Jones in full military bluster as Colonel Chester Phillips. Only Hayley Atwell comes across as too wan to play the tough-acting strategic officer Peggy Carter, Steve's romantic interest which the filmmakers barely have time to explore. No matter since the whole venture has obviously been designed as a springboard for 2012's ""Avengers"" sequel.",4,Seemingly Old-Fashioned Superhero Epic Gives the Marvel Franchise More Life Than Expected,1312156800,"08 1, 2011",2011,3489,"['should', 'come', 'surprise', 'mid-summer', '2011', 'entry', 'Marvel', 'Comics-originated', 'series', 'would', 'be', 'most', 'unabashedly', 'old-fashioned', 'Avengers-related', 'sagas', 'what', 'admirable', 'particular', 'epic', 'adventure', 'how', 'committed', 'director', 'Joe', 'Johnston', 'October', 'Sky', 'co-screenwriters', 'Christopher', 'Markus', 'Stephen', 'McFeely', 'Chronicles', 'Narnia', 'appear', 'be', 'telling', 'somewhat', 'revisionist', 'story', 'such', 'patriotic', 'good-versus-evil', 'fervor', 'own', 'comic-book', 'terms', 'nothing', 'emotionally', 'complex', 'tale', 'familiar', 'superhero', 'standard-issue', 'time-travel', 'element', 'bring', 'Avengers', 'together', 'Bookended', 'present-day', 'scenes', 'bulk', 'story', 'stalwart', 'hero', 'primary', 'adversary', 'how', 'confront', 'other', 'height', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'many', 'respects', 'film', 'spiritual', 'kinship', 'earlier', 'retro-style', 'epics', 'likeRaiders', 'Lost', 'Arkand', '1977', 'version', 'ofSuperman.The', 'historical', 'part', 'story', 'Norway', 'where', 'see', 'renegade', 'Nazi', 'Johann', 'Schmidt', 'uncovering', 'extraordinary', 'power', 'source', 'use', 'global', 'domination', 'Meanwhile', 'back', 'US', 'diminutive', 'physically', 'weak', 'Steve', 'Rogers', 'trying', 'desperately', 'serve', 'country', 'military', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'past', '4-F', 'status', 'plucky', 'tenacity', 'not', 'go', 'unnoticed', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'military', 'scientist', 'Dr.', 'Abraham', 'Erskine', 'highly', 'risky', 'experiment', 'will', 'transform', 'muscular', 'soldier', 'superhuman', 'strength', 'speed', 'heroic', 'act', 'derring-do', 'Nazi', 'spy', 'immediately', 'spotlight', 'US', 'government', 'decides', 'use', 'sell', 'savings', 'bonds', 'patriotic', 'USO', 'revues', 'However', 'when', 'Steve', 'out', 'best', 'buddy', 'Bucky', 'Barnes', 'lost', 'enemy', 'lines', 'Captain', 'America', 'truly', 'born', 'complete', 'indestructible', 'Vibranium', 'shield', 'Naturally', 'not', 'only', 'Bucky', 'entire', 'battalion', 'who', 'were', 'given', 'up', 'dead', 'merely', 'up', 'final', 'showdown', 'evil', 'Schmidt', 'who', 'transformed', 'Red', 'Skull', 'super-powered', 'head', 'HYDRA', 'Nazi', 'occult', 'research', 'action', 'second', 'half', 'well-paced', 'impressively', 'choreographed', 'also', 'increasingly', 'overblown', 'when', 'consider', 'how', 'Captain', 'America', 'steadfastly', 'beacon', 'service', 'loyalty', 'direct', 'contrast', 'megalomania', 'Red', 'Skull', 'finale', 'feels', 'anti-climactic', 'many', 'ways', 'Already', 'familiar', 'Marvel', 'fans', 'hot-headed', 'Johnny', 'Storm/', 'Human', 'Torch', 'theFantastic', 'Fourmovies', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'playing', 'such', 'earnest', 'character', 'especially', 'first', 'part', 'where', 'CGI', 'effects', 'turn', 'classic', '98-pound', 'weakling', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'field', 'day', 'Schmidt', 'even', 'character', 'motivations', 'start', 'come', 'simplistic', 'Other', 'actors', 'fare', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'somewhat', 'predictably', 'given', 'lack', 'true', 'dimension', 'are', 'given', 'play', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'inInfamous', 'HYDRA', 'No', '2', 'Dr.', 'Arnim', 'Zola', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'slyly', 'supportive', 'Erskine', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'full', 'military', 'bluster', 'Colonel', 'Chester', 'Phillips', 'Only', 'Hayley', 'Atwell', 'too', 'wan', 'play', 'tough-acting', 'strategic', 'officer', 'Peggy', 'Carter', 'Steve', 'romantic', 'interest', 'filmmakers', 'barely', 'have', 'time', 'explore', 'matter', 'whole', 'venture', 'obviously', 'been', 'designed', 'springboard', '2012', 'Avengers', 'sequel']",N/A
1462273,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B005IZLPKQ,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 2]","CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE FIRST AVENGER (2011) is one of those bizarre films that just doesn't seem destined for success, despite its production values. Yet I see a kind of campaign here to down-vote any critical review, and an equally annoying number of 21- or 22-word reviews saying, ""Cool movie, kids loved it."" And those reviews are the ones getting higher votes.As the latest iteration of the Capt. America character (the list includes one film just a few years old) I ask: Is this overproduced? B-quality? A morbid fixation? Chris Evans is stunning in his beauty and manliness; why not present him in the best package available? So, it could be all or none of the abovementioned that is the main trouble with this film. Evans is certainly not the problem, though he's also not one of the most interesting actors I've ever seen. A nice body only gets you so far.May I offer this as a consideration: Chris Evans is a comic-book-film regular. He's already done both the FANTASTIC FOUR films, PUSH, THE LOSERS, and SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD. See my reviews for PUSH and PILGRIM. His involvement in THE AVENGERS will be his 9th or 10th involvement in a comic book project. So what's he accomplished here?We have the story of Capt. America, beginning with what looked to me like Chris Evans' head rotoscoped onto the body of a thin 16-year-old boy. This is to put across his short, ""98-LBS.-weakling"" status. (More amazing overproduction: what I just described is what they wanted to do. What they did instead was digitally shrink and shrivel poor Chris' actual body.) I leave the rest of this mostly silly, empty story for you to discover.I will confine my review to random observations:1. Hugo Weaving makes an excellent Red Skull, with a flawless German accent. I know, what with all the German accent experts in America, Weaving's pronunciation was ridiculed. I always ask: could you have done better?2. The production is great here, therefore sadly wasted.3. I wonder why Hitler was left out of this.4. Stan Lee's cameo: brilliant!5. Dominic Cooper (as Howard Stark) is CUTE. Much easier on the eyes than his cinematic son Robert Downey, Jr.6. This film made me wonder: is Captain America just a wee bit gay? Of course when I ask that, it is meant as a COMPLIMENT.7. Don't hold your breath waiting for any really good, intelligent lines.8. Toby Jones, who is used as a prop here, is a brilliant great star of our age and deserves better than this. In fact, so does Hugo Weaving. Lord bless them, they acted their hearts out!9. This film actually did answer a burning query I had: THE AVENGERS (is that the right title?) will be released in May 2012. All the dopey films, such as THOR, have ended by saying the main character will return in THE AVENGERS or THE JUSTICE LEAGUE or POSSIBLY GAY HUNKS IN TIGHTS or whatever it is. (Remember what I said about ""gay"".)10. Much as I love him, I am so tired of seeing Samuel L. Jackson popping into the post-credits as Nick Fury. OK, WE GET IT!You can tell what a bore certain films are, when you consider the things crossing your mind as being much more fascinating than the film you're supposed to be watching. This film accomplishes that, but I suppose it's fine as a drab popcorn film.All I know is I was bored by the fact that Chris Evans' Capt.

There are no surprises, not even when Hugo Weaving rips off his face.  Chris Evans has the look but lacks charisma.  Tommy Lee Jones is uncharacteristically nasty and also a bit of a clich&eacute;.  Many scenes felt like rip-offs of other films (why did this movie begin like The Thing?).  How many times has a movie character been caught kissing the wrong girl (and have it not amount to anything)?  Seriously, riding on the top of a speeding taxi, that's never been done before!  The BLUE LIGHT special wasn't.  It's nice to know a movie can be futuristic and a period piece at the same time and not defy logic or reality.They wasted so much time prepping this movie as a means of introducing the character, destined for other films, that they left out the most intriguing part of his story, the comeback.  He went from one time period (they devoted a full two hours to it), to another time period in the blink of an eye (we even get to see the blink as a long blackout).  That's it.  The end.  Stay tuned.  To be continued.  I'm surprised they didn't use ""never mind"" as their postscript.For me, this was a huge letdown.  Their only attribute, Stanley Tucci, was wasted in a small role.

1462276,AMMXFNJSKJUQ,B005IZLPKQ,ElectricMelody,"[2, 3]","**Originally posted on ""#1 Hits From Another Planet"" - 7/27/11**Growing up, I was a huge Marvel Comics guy. Like many comic geeks, my battle line was well and truly defined. It was Marvel all the way... no DC (except Batman... sometimes). And even though I'm ""grown up"" now, I still anticipate each Marvel movie release with great excitement. After all, throughout the past few years, they've had a pretty dynamite track record.And they've done it again. Despite loving (and knowing every little aspect about) the Marvel Universe as a kid, Captain America was never one of my favorite characters. That being said, they've just made the perfect Captain America movie. I'm not saying it's a perfect movie, but I can't imagine anything better being fashioned from this character's story. It easily ties X-Men: First Class as my favorite comic book movie of the summer.The film works so well for so many different reasons. For one, it has an ultra appealing lead actor and a main character with equal parts heart, humor and symbolism. It also features a charismatic (and truly badass) villain in the Red Skull (played by the always reliable Hugo Weaving). This was one of my main quibbles with Thor earlier this year, and definitely Green Lantern last month. A hero's only as good as its villain. Bonus points for the make-up job. Very, very cool.Best of all, the movie's old-fashioned in the best possible way. True, the vast majority of the story takes place in the 1940's (and the parts that don't are pretty dang awesome), but like X-Men was, this is a heavily stylized setting, amping up reality to create a comic-book vibe that doesn't take itself too seriously, yet honors the story's roots at the same time. Most tellingly, the story itself has a good old-fashioned feel to it. The inevitable crash boom bang parts are there, but they're sandwiched within a story with characters you actually care about. One of my fears going into the theater was that this was going to turn out to be a boring trudge through history. Not so. I had an absolute blast. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if this movie ups Captain America tenfold in the superhero pop culture pantheon. He's like Superman, but relatable.

What it is, is solid and adding some of the war movie trappings onto a superhero story was a refreshing change.As befits the character of Captain America/Steve Rogers (effectively captured by Chris Evans) there wasn't much in the way of self doubt or shades of grey. Cap does what he does because he believes it is the right thing to do. Plain and simple.The supporting cast was good too. Hugo Weaving gave us the over the top two dimensional Red Skull that that particular character demands and Tommy Lee Jones was... well Tommy Lee Jones.My biggest criticism is that the material was a little rushed.

Or Green Lantern. Or Swamp Thing. Anything Darkhawk.... Okay, so DH is Marvel. Anyway. What I have always loved in comics is man's ability to overcome enormous tribulations without relying on so called 'super powers'. Knowing this, you can imagine how bad I wanted to see Captain America. Despite the fact that I am a DC fanboy.Marvel's latest addition to what will be the Avenger's film is a knock out of the park. The sense of the Cap before the super-soldier program is amazing. There's this 80-pound version of Chris Evans and he's the best. Loyal and morally strong, with a love of the American ideals. The transformation into a super soldier is amazing; he is shown 'over-using' his new body and all but trips himself up because he actually realize he's running faster on foot than the cars drive around him. His innocent patriotism becomes an unstoppable force, and it makes you believe that one man can indeed make a difference.I have to give a nod to Alan Silvestri's score for the film. It strikes a strong central theme that fits the balance between patriotism and honest strength and it sounds authentic to the mid-40's. Well done, good sir.Cinematography is marvelous. Together with the stages and authentic vehicles and storefronts, we actually feel that we've been engaged with WWII hanging over our heads.The BD is just as awe-inspiring. We have the Holy Grail of sound - a 7.1 Sound track; it's only the 2nd I've ever seen. We get several featurettes, all showing various technical tid-bits and it is not the same point-counting drivel some folk have thrown together on DVD or BD. They manage to provide the tech talk with their own appreciation of the source material. There's a short film featuring Agent Coulson which demands automatic laughter at the most unsuspected details. Worth the $25 of the Blu-Ray 2-disc. It's gonna be a classic, mark my words.I'm watching the film now with the commentary. Already it seems less 'stuffy' than most; a mixture of technical talk with fond memories.  >>>EDIT: the commentary is actually pretty fun stuff, pointing out Easter eggs and hinting towards things to come. Alas, they provided no commentary on the post-credits scene. Not that they needed to; it pretty much speaks for itself.>>>But the best part is, we have seen some bit of what Marvel has in store for us. The Avenger's film is going to break a few benchmarks in modern film making. DC may have the Animated features each a tight and solid entry for the DCU, but beyond the Batman franchise, and possibly Green Lantern, DC just doesn't match the steam behind Marvel's power. I'm still holding out for a Flash feature film.I'll probably catch some flames from this review. But I have to be honest and objectionable. Marvel is reminding me of a time in my youth when I didn't know DC Comics existed. And the Avengers were one of my favourite titles way back then. I'm glad to see anything positive come from anything comic-book related. Makes the years of living as a geek somewhat tolerable.

I love just about every character Hugo Weaving has ever played in his career, but his portrayal of the villain bored me to tears.  Maybe it was the directing?  Even the feel of the portrayal of the Nazis were off.  They got the look right, but that's about it.  I kept thinking that someone like Steven Spielberg or George Lucas would have done a much better job at making this movie pop.Captain America had potential, but it seemed like the powers that be were so intent on just getting it out in theatres to start working on an Avenger movie, that they kind of just threw it together and got lucky with choosing Chris Evans as the lead.  It's not the worst superhero movie I've seen (Punisher would be that), but like the majority of the other superhero movies that have come out in the past decade, it had nowhere near the depth and intensity that the new Batman movies (with Christian Bale) had nor did it have the fresh, fun, thrill and charm of the Superman movies (with Christopher Reeve and Gene Hackman) that came out in the late 70s.

In the end, the only real dissapointing thing about the movie is the way it introduced James ""Bucky"" Barnes, Captain America's sidekick. In my opinion, this should have remained more true to the comics. Nonetheless, this is a Captain America movie. And while Chris Evans didn't come across as Cap-like in the first half of the movie, by the end I found myself warming up to his take on the role. As an action film, this movie works well. The effects and battle scenes are well done. I was particularly impressed with the way Cap uses his shield in this fight scenes. This is even difficult to get right in the comics, but they got it right in this movie. There is a good villain, the Red Skull, and there is a more than satisfactory ending.

CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE FIRST AVENGER got it right - THIS is how you make a superhero movie!!1) DO humanize your hero but not by creating disgusting habits in him (Iron Man) - rather by presenting him as the personified goodness all humans possess but infrequently act on. DON'T turn him into a total pathetic wuss and moronic jerk at the beginning only to turn the improbable light switch for him to become the hero he's supposed to be.2) DO showcase the central character in ALL his comic book glory and yes, a little patriotic flag waving doesn't hurt. Um, he is suppeosed to be an AMERICAN hero after all not just a ""citizen of the world."" DON'T be ashamed of the golden legacy that turned an imagined character into an enduring icon of American culture. (Superman Returns and Smallville - I'm thinking of you.)3) DO stick to ONE story thread and carry it to completion. DON'T try to ""add depth and diversity"" by intoducing a bunch of superfluous characters that only serve to create a mess (Green Lantern, G.I. Joe and again, Smallville).4) DO give the superhero a supervillain worthy of him. DON'T save the good stuff for a planned sequel because if your original movie sucks, the sequel becomes very unlikely (Superman Returns - Spacey's version of Lex Luthor was laughable and not in a good way. The first Hulk - his own father???)5) DO bring out the trumpets and flurries for a memorable theme song. DON'T rely on cheesy heavy metal ""music"" (Matrix movies).6) DO allow the superhero to fall long and hard for the ONE true love of his life and vice versa. DON'T create insanely obnoxious girly pointless melodrama (Spider-Man, Superman Returns and Smallville). On similar note, DO present the hero's LOVE and soulmate in all her stellar glory as his one and only equal - SHOW it, DON'T just say it.7) DO frame the hero in stunning action sequences in all his head to toe uniformed glory (Tom Welling, PLEASE take note). DON'T pick an actor to play said hero if he's going to refuse to wear the suit by trying to hide behind a lame ass excuse such as ""it's more interesting to show what happend in the character's life before he became the hero we know him to be."" DON'T, DO NOT disrespect your audience by presuming to tell us what to think. If you're going to film the Statue of Liberty, doesn't it make sense that the audience expects to actually SEE the Statue of Liberty and not a blurry CGI version of it or just a close up of the head?CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE FIRST AVENGER is quite simply, THE BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE EVER MADE. Chris Evans and Haley Atwell are bona fide stars. Hugo Weaving, Tommy Lee Jones, Stanley Tucci and really, ALL the supporting characters have earned my respect. The writers and director Joe Johnston have created a masterpiece.

First the highly underrated  ""The Rocketeer"" in the summer of 1991, and now the best super hero film of the summer of 2011.  Most people know the story of Steve Rogers, the 98 lb weakling turned into a  super-soldier by a scientific experiment.Created by the legendary Jack Kirby and Joe Simon before the U.S. officially entered the war, this film is fun and exciting from start to finish.  Chris Evans, the ""Human Torch"" from the Fantastic Four films is great both as 98 lb. Steve and super soldier Steve.  Tommy Lee Jones is a riot as a Pattonish Colonel that Captain America serves under.  British actress Hayley Atwell is beautiful in 1940's style make-up and hair design as the British officer assigned to the Captain America experiment who winds up being Steve's nominal love interest and Hugo Weaving is appropriately nasty as the Captain's nemesis, Red Skull.As stated the action is fast and furious and the patriotic spirit of WW II is captured beautifully.  There is a nice patriotic musical number, ""The Man with the Plan"" starring the good Captain and a group of dancers probably representing the Radio City Music Hall Rockettes, played during the Captain's war bonds tour.The picture and sound quality of the blu-ray are fine.  There are numerous not very long ""making of"" segments and one featuring the story of the Captain's origin.  There are deleted scenes and a much longer segment of the scene at the end where the Captain first meets Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury that is far better than the scene actually used in the film.  The music by Alan Silvestri is fine and the end-credits include patriotic posters, most of which were probably actually used during the war.  This just adds to the film's obviously patriotic feeling.I looked forward more to ""Green Lantern"" last summer and greatly enjoyed it.  However I enjoyed this film more.  (If you enjoyed Director Johnston's work on this film, check out the previously mentioned ""The Rocketeer""  I'm sure you will enjoy that one as well.)And now we can look forward to the good Captain joining Iron Man, Thor, The Hulk and others in the ""Avengers"" film next May.And if you haven't already seen the film in the movies, stay to the absolute end of the credits for more on the above.",5,The Most Enjoyable Film of Last Summer,1320710400,"11 8, 2011",2011,2380,"['now', 'obvious', 'when', 'want', 'super-hero', 'film', 'place', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'man', 'turn', 'Joe', 'Johnston', 'First', 'highly', 'underrated', 'Rocketeer', 'summer', '1991', 'now', 'best', 'super', 'hero', 'film', 'summer', '2011', 'Most', 'people', 'know', 'story', 'Steve', 'Rogers', '98', 'lb', 'weakling', 'turned', 'super-soldier', 'scientific', 'experiment.Created', 'legendary', 'Jack', 'Kirby', 'Joe', 'Simon', 'U.S.', 'officially', 'entered', 'war', 'film', 'fun', 'exciting', 'start', 'finish', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'Human', 'Torch', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'films', 'great', '98', 'lb', 'Steve', 'super', 'soldier', 'Steve', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'riot', 'Pattonish', 'Colonel', 'Captain', 'America', 'British', 'actress', 'Hayley', 'Atwell', 'beautiful', '1940', 'style', 'make-up', 'hair', 'design', 'British', 'officer', 'assigned', 'Captain', 'America', 'experiment', 'who', 'up', 'being', 'Steve', 'nominal', 'love', 'interest', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'appropriately', 'nasty', 'Captain', 'nemesis', 'Red', 'Skull.As', 'stated', 'action', 'fast', 'furious', 'patriotic', 'spirit', 'WW', 'II', 'captured', 'beautifully', 'nice', 'patriotic', 'musical', 'number', 'Man', 'Plan', 'starring', 'good', 'Captain', 'group', 'dancers', 'probably', 'representing', 'Radio', 'City', 'Music', 'Hall', 'Rockettes', 'played', 'Captain', 'war', 'bonds', 'tour.The', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'blu-ray', 'are', 'fine', 'are', 'numerous', 'not', 'very', 'long', 'making', 'segments', 'one', 'featuring', 'story', 'Captain', 'origin', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'much', 'longer', 'segment', 'scene', 'end', 'where', 'Captain', 'first', 'meets', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'Nick', 'Fury', 'far', 'better', 'scene', 'actually', 'used', 'film', 'music', 'Alan', 'Silvestri', 'fine', 'end-credits', 'include', 'patriotic', 'posters', 'most', 'were', 'probably', 'actually', 'used', 'war', 'just', 'film', 'obviously', 'patriotic', 'feeling.I', 'looked', 'forward', 'more', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'last', 'summer', 'greatly', 'enjoyed', 'However', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'more', 'enjoyed', 'Director', 'Johnston', 'work', 'film', 'check', 'out', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'Rocketeer', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'enjoy', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'now', 'can', 'look', 'forward', 'good', 'Captain', 'joining', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Thor', 'Hulk', 'others', 'Avengers', 'film', 'next', 'May.And', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'seen', 'film', 'movies', 'stay', 'absolute', 'end', 'credits', 'more', 'above']",N/A

This is how I saw the transition of Steve Rogers (a very small skinny guy) into Captain America - a fairly large muscular guy. Obviously a lot of computer work went on here. Although all very well done, there was still something slightly disturbing about this transition.The anomaly that sort of diminished this movie is that it is set in the 1940s, yet the technology seems to be on-par, or exceeds what we have today - ray guns that can vaporize an entire human in a single shot. This begs the question, why more like Captain America were not made, and how come over a period of 70 years we have not been able to perfect and replicate this kind of technology.Putting aside these issues... The acting and the movie as a whole is entertaining. Hugo Weaving puts on an excellent performance as the bad guy. Another weird thing about this movie was the idea of the US Army using their most combat ready soldier for musicals and cheap entertainment. Very strange ... but I suppose they had to have some filler to make up the time, so that it would be a full movie.",3,A Bit Cheezy but Enjoyable,1326499200,"01 14, 2012",2012,1177,"['loved', 'Captain', 'America', 'comics', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie.Firstly', 'think', ""'the"", 'curious', 'case', 'Benjamin', 'Button', 'how', 'saw', 'transition', 'Steve', 'Rogers', 'very', 'small', 'skinny', 'guy', 'Captain', 'America', 'fairly', 'large', 'muscular', 'guy', 'Obviously', 'lot', 'computer', 'work', 'went', 'here', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'was', 'still', 'something', 'slightly', 'disturbing', 'transition.The', 'anomaly', 'sort', 'diminished', 'movie', 'set', '1940s', 'yet', 'technology', 'be', 'on-par', 'what', 'have', 'today', 'ray', 'guns', 'can', 'vaporize', 'entire', 'human', 'single', 'shot', 'question', 'why', 'more', 'Captain', 'America', 'were', 'not', 'made', 'how', 'come', 'period', '70', 'years', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'able', 'perfect', 'replicate', 'kind', 'technology.Putting', 'issues', 'acting', 'movie', 'whole', 'entertaining', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'excellent', 'performance', 'bad', 'guy', 'weird', 'thing', 'movie', 'was', 'idea', 'US', 'Army', 'using', 'most', 'combat', 'ready', 'soldier', 'musicals', 'cheap', 'entertainment', 'Very', 'strange', 'suppose', 'had', 'have', 'filler', 'make', 'up', 'time', 'would', 'be', 'full', 'movie']",N/A

1462320,A19XZDFMSCBZ10,B005IZLPKQ,G. Prout,"[7, 36]","I dont even know where to begin.  I guess I should just get the ""its part of the marvel universe and thus HAS to tie in to the other movies"" disclaimer out there.  Which should surprise nobody of course but it does lend credence to the fact that the movie is a total joke.  There are so many pathetic attempts to tie in the rest of the marvel charactors.  The blue light/energy in the beginning being from Norse Gods (Thor), having Stark personally fly the plane behind enemy lines (Ironman).  Seriously?  Why would a billionaire arms dealer even have been in Italy during that scene?  Ill tell you why, retarded writing and needs to get the movie more tie ins with the rest of the stupid Avengers movies.  I guess I should admit that I am not a fan of comic books or the idea of superpowers.  HOWEVER, with a good story I will enjoy just about anything. However Captain America is NOT a clever, well written story.  Its more like a Michael Bay explosion fest for 10 year old boys.The movie follows Steve a little guy who wants to join the Army and fight for America. Hes been turned down a bunch of times due to all kinds of medical problems.  So naturally the scientist in charge of a trillion dollar experiment chooses him to be his main test subject.  I mean its not like the procedure was supposed to hurt and require... resilience or anything.  Oh wait a second... So Steve is now Captain America and all buffed out and becomes a celebrity and he gets put to work selling bonds and raising morale. Apparently this is a bad thing?  I guess nobody told that to President Reagan or Bob Hope who did WAY more in said capacities than they could have contributed on the front lines (unless they had a trashcan lid shield that is).  But I digress.  So Captain America decides to go in alone without any intelligence on a heavily fortified Hydra facility where his best bud is a POW and working like a slave along with a ton of other POWs.  Naturally Captain America gets in {thanks to his girlfriend some British chick who for some reason only works with Americans and her friend Tony (or whatever) Stark the aforementioned billionaire arms dealer and scientist who also pilots suicide missions behind enemy lines on his days off apparently}.  So Captain America gets in and beats the ONE guard watching over the POWs and sets them loose.  They rush outside into like 200 guards and of course being unarmed and the guards carrying like blue laser-RPG-machine guns the POWs just whoop the crap out of the guards and break loose. At that point I just stopped watching due to the ridiculously poor EVERYTHING in this movie.  The only character in the movie who I had found believable before I tuned out was the Colonel, played by Tommy Lee Jones.  But as decent a job as he did, he is not worth suffering through this garbage heap of a movie.  Save your time and watch one of the new Batmans if you absolutely need a superhero movie.  Or wait for Man of Steel (2013) which although a superhero movie is being produced by Christopher Nolan so there is a chance it will actually have a story meant provoke intelligent thought and not just a tie in for *Aquaman 3D or some such garbage.",1,Soooo bad,1349568000,"10 7, 2012",2012,3179,"['dont', 'even', 'know', 'where', 'begin', 'guess', 'should', 'just', 'get', 'part', 'marvel', 'universe', 'thus', 'HAS', 'tie', 'other', 'movies', 'there', 'Which', 'should', 'surprise', 'nobody', 'course', 'lend', 'credence', 'fact', 'movie', 'total', 'joke', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'pathetic', 'attempts', 'tie', 'rest', 'marvel', 'charactors', 'blue', 'light/energy', 'beginning', 'being', 'Norse', 'Gods', 'Thor', 'having', 'Stark', 'personally', 'fly', 'plane', 'enemy', 'lines', 'Ironman', 'Seriously', 'Why', 'would', 'billionaire', 'arms', 'dealer', 'even', 'have', 'been', 'Italy', 'scene', 'Ill', 'tell', 'why', 'retarded', 'writing', 'get', 'movie', 'more', 'tie', 'ins', 'rest', 'stupid', 'Avengers', 'movies', 'guess', 'should', 'admit', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'comic', 'books', 'idea', 'superpowers', 'HOWEVER', 'good', 'story', 'will', 'enjoy', 'just', 'anything', 'However', 'Captain', 'America', 'NOT', 'clever', 'well', 'written', 'story', 'more', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'explosion', 'fest', '10', 'year', 'old', 'boys.The', 'movie', 'Steve', 'little', 'guy', 'who', 'join', 'Army', 'fight', 'America', 'Hes', 'been', 'turned', 'down', 'bunch', 'times', 'due', 'kinds', 'medical', 'problems', 'So', 'naturally', 'scientist', 'charge', 'trillion', 'dollar', 'experiment', 'be', 'main', 'test', 'subject', 'mean', 'not', 'procedure', 'was', 'supposed', 'hurt', 'require', 'resilience', 'anything', 'Oh', 'wait', 'second', 'So', 'Steve', 'now', 'Captain', 'America', 'buffed', 'out', 'celebrity', 'put', 'work', 'selling', 'bonds', 'raising', 'morale', 'Apparently', 'bad', 'thing', 'guess', 'nobody', 'told', 'President', 'Reagan', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'who', 'did', 'WAY', 'more', 'said', 'capacities', 'could', 'have', 'contributed', 'front', 'lines', 'had', 'trashcan', 'lid', 'shield', 'digress', 'So', 'Captain', 'America', 'go', 'alone', 'intelligence', 'heavily', 'fortified', 'Hydra', 'facility', 'where', 'best', 'bud', 'POW', 'working', 'slave', 'ton', 'other', 'POWs', 'Naturally', 'Captain', 'America', 'thanks', 'girlfriend', 'British', 'chick', 'who', 'reason', 'only', 'Americans', 'friend', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'aforementioned', 'billionaire', 'arms', 'dealer', 'scientist', 'who', 'also', 'pilots', 'suicide', 'missions', 'enemy', 'lines', 'days', 'off', 'apparently', 'So', 'Captain', 'America', 'beats', 'ONE', 'guard', 'watching', 'POWs', 'loose', 'rush', 'outside', 'like', '200', 'guards', 'course', 'being', 'unarmed', 'guards', 'carrying', 'blue', 'laser-RPG-machine', 'guns', 'POWs', 'just', 'whoop', 'crap', 'guards', 'break', 'loose', 'point', 'just', 'stopped', 'watching', 'due', 'ridiculously', 'poor', 'EVERYTHING', 'movie', 'only', 'character', 'movie', 'who', 'had', 'found', 'believable', 'tuned', 'out', 'was', 'Colonel', 'played', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'decent', 'job', 'did', 'not', 'worth', 'suffering', 'garbage', 'heap', 'movie', 'Save', 'time', 'watch', 'one', 'new', 'Batmans', 'absolutely', 'need', 'superhero', 'movie', 'wait', 'Man', 'Steel', '2013', 'superhero', 'movie', 'being', 'produced', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'chance', 'will', 'actually', 'have', 'story', 'meant', 'provoke', 'intelligent', 'thought', 'not', 'just', 'tie', '*Aquaman', '3D', 'such', 'garbage']",N/A
1462321,A328S9RN3U5M68,B005IZLPKQ,Grady Harp,"[1, 2]","CAPTAIN AMERICA succeeds on so many levels that it is difficult to list them all.  But perhaps one of the most refreshing aspects of this film is that it treats the story in a time frame (WW II) that makes the 'supernatural heroes and villains' seem like operatically overstated normal people.  Opening the film with the superhero as a skinny nerdy but ethical and committed to do good kid and then see him transform into the hero of heroes who for once is doing good things because he cares about his fellowmen and his country makes for a feel good experience.  Dapple that with some old-fashioned 1940s Rockettes type dance sequences and keep the 'impossible gimmicks' down to a level of near credibility and you have a winner.Quick, borrowed plot outline: 'It is 1942, America has entered World War II, and sickly but determined Steve Rogers is frustrated at being rejected yet again for military service. Everything changes when Dr. Erksine recruits him for the secret Project Rebirth. Proving his extraordinary courage, wits and conscience, Rogers undergoes the experiment and his weak body is suddenly enhanced into the maximum human potential. When Dr. Erksine is then immediately assassinated by an agent of Nazi Germany's head of its secret HYDRA research department, Johann Schmidt aka the Red Skull, Rogers is left as a unique man who is initially misused as a propaganda mascot. However, when his comrades need him, Rogers goes on a successful adventure that truly makes him Captain America and his war against Schmidt begins.'  And that about says it all.Now, populate this story with a cast of first rate actors - Chris Evans as the magnificent Adonis built Steve Rogers/Captain America, Stanley Tucci as Dr Erskine, Hayley Atwell as the sole 'love interest' Peggy Carter (Natalie Dormer does have a few seconds of screen time, too), Tommy Lee Jones as the military guy in charge, Sebastian Stan as Steve's best buddy, Dominic Cooper (a good guy), and a set of villains starting with Hugo Weaving as Red Skull, Toby Jones as Dr.Zola, Richard Armitage as Heinz Kruger and then fill in the spare parts with the likes of Samuel L. Jackson, Neal McDonough, Derek Luke, Kenneth Choi, JJ Feild, Bruno Ricci, Michael Brandon, Martin Sherman  etc and the results are almost guaranteed to be good.Joe Johnston directs the film in a propulsive fashion that takes time out for some humanity amid all the military derring-do and allows just the right amount of sarcasm and humor (courtesy the screenplay by  Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely) and it all comes out 'just swell'.

Granted it's better than a lot of the other ""comic book movies"" I've watched over the years, but still not a great movie. Joe Johnston started his career in film working on effects for Empire and Raiders and ended up directing the Rocketeer (a far better comic book movie than this) and didn't do too much else through the rest of the `90's and `00's. I thought he was a great choice to helm this franchise seeing as how he has already tackled a comic book movie from the same genre. But this movie is flat in dialogue and story, the effects are well done but the art design seems boring and border line generic. I wanted to like this movie more than I did, but I can't like it for what I wanted it to be, I can only kind of like it for what it is. I can't complain about the acting or music or pacing, just that it seems to be lacking depth and heart. The extra features are on the weak side. This movie looks great on Blu-Ray, it's sharp and has great detail. If you love The Rocketeer, or Indian Jones or good comic book movies like Batman (1989), The Avengers and Ironman, this movie may seem a bit disappointing.

Very entertaining and informative.Negatives:Some background on the energy source would have made the story more coherent.More of an explanation as to how all the  high tech gadgetry came about. A cop out to comic book fans who don't like to think while being entertained.A more developed plot sequence on how the various HYDRA labs were to be attacked rather than just show up out of nowhere and start firing away. Again bowing to a certain comic book audience demographic.Roles and acting such as Jones' character shows he tediously stuck in an actor's rut. Usual token roles again for Asians and blacks and the overdone female role portrayed by Atwell as romantic interest and tough girl just seemed tossed into the plot to satisfy both the male comic book audience and to widen the demographic viewer profile all for remunerative reasons.Positives:Evans portrayal of the Cap was good, but I'm not sure which body was his and which was morphed in.Fairly good quality and not yet overly overboard dominance in the use of CGI - just enough to create a good fantasy atmosphere. They did seem to borrow props and scenes from The Thing and Sky Captain ... amongst others.The story tie in with WWII was integrated with appropriate humor and where appropriate, seriousness.

1462335,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B005IZLPKQ,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[3, 5]","It's crucial that you get to like Steve Rogers when he was only this 98-pound weakling, crucial that you grow to care for this runty, scrawny, asthmatic kid who persists in standing up for himself and for others, never mind that this usually rewards him with bruises and lumps. It's 1943, in wartime America, and Steve Rogers yearns to do his part, if the military would only allow him to. Five times he's tried to enlist only to be summarily rejected as 4F. Meanwhile, his best friend James ""Bucky"" Barnes is a sergeant in the U.S. Army, cutting a dashing figure, shining the ladies, bullying those who'd been bullying Steve. You note Steve's lack of resentment over this, and like him for it.CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE FIRST AVENGER is the one I'd been looking forward to the most this year, and I'm pleased as punch to say that this movie did not tank, that it in fact is fairly bloody brilliant. I enjoyed THOR and X-MEN: FIRST CLASS, but CAPTAIN AMERICA is the best Marvel flick since IRON MAN and it gets you charged up for THE AVENGERS movie. Chris Evans - damn.Steve Rogers's impassioned speech to Bucky is overheard by Dr. Abraham Erskine, a kindly German scientist working for the U.S. government. Dr. Erskine heads a top secret government program involving the creation of the super-soldier, and on these shores he's looking for a candidate to be his inaugural test subject (he'd had an earlier candidate elsewhere but that didn't work out so well; more on that in a bit). Dr. Erskine sees past Steve's sickly frame. He's intrigued with Steve's spirit. He gets him enlisted in the U.S. Army.Compared to the rest of the film, the first third segment is less action-packed, but that doesn't equate to dull or slow. We track Steve Rogers' time in boot camp and we take in his struggles. He tires easy. He's always finishing last. The camp's gruff director, Colonel Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones, hogging all the good lines), is highly skeptical and takes Dr. Erskine to task for Rogers' presence. But we note Rogers' quiet diligence and doggedness, and these strong character moments provide the building blocks for making what happens to him later so resonating and gratifying.If you're caught up on Marvel Comics continuity, then you're up to snuff on what happens next. Steve Rogers undergoes Erskine's treatment which galvanizes change on an awesome cellular scale. I think the best CG work done by the film's f/x crew, hands down, is in the shrinking and scrawnying of Chris Evans and making it look seamless. Steve Rogers as the beneficiary of the super-soldier serum is a picture in bold contrast, a foot taller and now rippling with muscles. But this is Chris Evans in real, the guy having worked his tail off to get this buff (even though Chris Hemsworth probably still points at him and smirks).If you don't know your Captain America history, I'll just mention that an act of sabotage renders Steve Rogers the world's one and only super soldier. Which gets us to an inspired plot thread which isn't part of Captain America lore. And, fine, here's a ***SPOILERS alert*** for the rest of this paragraph. With Rogers the only one of his kind, Colonel Phillips has no use for him, and so Steve Rogers is deployed to USO tour appearances, putting on a show in the home front with chorus girls and shilling war bonds as the military mascot ""Captain America."" Like a good soldier, Steve goes along with it, but he wishes he could do more. We know that Cap will join the war soon enough, but, in the meantime, his time on stage just fills me with cinematic joy. I absolutely love that he gets his own awesome show jingle, ""Star Spangled Man,"" with music by Alan Menken. I also like how the film addresses the inherent cheesiness of the traditional Captain America costume, which is what he wears on these shows. Cap's later costume re-design would be more practical, less shiny, less tights.Chris Evans inhabits his role with conviction, imbues Steve Rogers with spunk and an appealing sweetness, and I'm not worried any more about how he might hold up against Robert Downey, Jr. and Samuel Jackson in THE AVENGERS movie. He just proved to me that he can command the screen. Fine actors like Tommy Lee Jones, Stanley Tucci, and Hugo Weaving add so much to the story. If you could point at the heart of the story, it may be the almost father-son relationship between Steve Rogers and Tucci's Dr. Erskine. Tucci isn't in the film much, but he leaves a defining mark. I was concerned about how the Red Skull would come off, but I should've known Hugo Weaving would make it work. His Nazi commandant, Johann Schmidt a.k.a. the Red Skull, is a convincing villain and, incidentally, a failed past test subject of Erskine's. As a guilty pleasure, I'm glad the biochemist Arnim Zola is here as well. Or, I dunno, maybe I'm fond of him because Ookla the Mok's ""Super Skrull"" song references him. (""He's endorsing RC Cola and cruising chicks with Arnim Zola."")Parts of Steve's origin are snatched from Marvel's Ultimate universe (portraying Bucky as someone in Steve's age bracket, for one thing). For fans of Marvel's cinematic continuity, Dominic Cooper riffs Robert Downey, Jr. a bit as Tony Stark's rakish genius industrialist father, Howard Stark. I wish Hayley Atwell as British Agent Peggy Carter were given more to do, but I suspect Atwell will reappear in future films as Agent 13, Sharon Carter. And if you were expecting Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos to show up, you're sort of right. The action is terrific, and maybe it's terrific because the story had taken the time to invest in its lead character. These aren't just tatters of action sequences. There's a compelling thru arc to tie everything together.But, okay, one thing nagged me. There's something jarringly anachronistic about the presence of Hydra and its super science. The strongest emotional impression I have to Cap is that he was a World War II hero who fought the Nazis and later became a tormented man-out-of-time. This movie removes the first part by replacing the Nazis with Hydra goons. And, although Hydra is supposed to be affiliated with them storm troopers - serving as Hitler's ""deep science division"" - it's not the same. ""Heil Hydra!"" just doesn't ring true. And Nazis always did make the best big bads.CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE FIRST AVENGER gives it up with that old-fashioned wartime nostalgia, with a grip of strong performances, with an indomitable legend to whom Chris Evans does justice. This movie has heart. Nothing embodies that more than the sequence in which the new Steve Rogers is in pursuit of a spy who tries to distract him by tossing a boy into the drink. About to dive in the water, Steve hears the boy briskly yell at him: ""I can swim. Go get him!"" That bit of bravado from the kid generated the loudest cheers from the theater audience.As per norm, stick around until after the closing credits. If what you see doesn't excite you... then you're probably executives over at DC Comics.",5,the star-spangled man with a plan,1311379200,"07 23, 2011",2011,6984,"['crucial', 'get', 'like', 'Steve',

Mark my words 2011-07-27 lets see how close I get.Back to this movie: It was hard for me to believe what a solid performance the former Human Torch Actor pulled off in his role of Captain America, I loved the inclusion of the Howling Commandoes too bad they did not put Tommy Lee Jones in the part of Colonel Nick Furry I rather think it was kind of assumed to some degree that the older fans would place him in that position anyway in our hearts.Too bad they decided to use Samuel Jackson as Nick Fury once they did that it made it hard to go back to the original mold of the character. I loved the lead actress she looked just like the pictures of my Grandmother from the 40'.The portrayal of the 40's was awesome they really did an excellent job of capturing the flavor and the feel of the times.The character who played the Red Skull did a superb job. He was born for the role just like Arnold was born to play Conan.All in all I really, really enjoyed this film and have already signed up to be notified when it is available for purchase.The best Movie of Summer 2011!",5,While not 100% faithful to the Comics,1311724800,"07 27, 2011",2011,1647,"['give', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'highest', 'rating', 'possible', 'story', 'line', 'spot', 'character', 'even', 'better', 'original', 'comics', 'introduction', 'cosmic', 'cube', 'so', 'early', 'real', 'bonus', 'can', 'foresee', 'return', 'RED', 'SKULL', 'Avengers', 'movie', 'only', 'thing', 'bothers', 're-imieagination', 'Thor', 'am', 'willing', 'bet', 'cosmic', 'cube', 'written', 'lost', 'Asgardian', 'piece', 'super', 'science', 'will', 'likely', 'dovetail', 'Starks', 'last', 'power', 'upgrade', 'last', 'Iron', 'Man', 'movie', 'where', 'ring', 'was', 'removed', 'place', 'triangle', 'Mark', 'words', '2011-07-27', 'lets', 'see', 'how', 'close', 'get.Back', 'movie', 'was', 'hard', 'believe', 'what', 'solid', 'performance', 'former', 'Human', 'Torch', 'Actor', 'pulled', 'off', 'role', 'Captain', 'America', 'loved', 'inclusion', 'Howling', 'Commandoes', 'too', 'bad', 'did', 'not', 'put', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'part', 'Colonel', 'Nick', 'Furry', 'rather', 'think', 'was', 'kind', 'assumed', 'degree', 'older', 'fans', 'would', 'place', 'position', 'anyway', 'hearts.Too', 'bad', 'decided', 'use', 'Samuel', 'Jackson', 'Nick', 'Fury', 'once', 'did', 'made', 'hard', 'go', 'back', 'original', 'mold', 'character', 'loved', 'lead', 'actress', 'looked', 'just', 'pictures', 'Grandmother', ""40'.The"", 'portrayal', '40', 'was', 'awesome', 'really', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'capturing', 'flavor', 'feel', 'times.The', 'character', 'who', 'played', 'Red', 'Skull', 'did', 'superb', 'job', 'was', 'born', 'role', 'just', 'Arnold', 'was', 'born', 'play', 'Conan.All', 'really', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'have', 'already', 'signed', 'up', 'be', 'notified', 'when', 'available', 'purchase.The', 'best', 'Movie', 'Summer', '2011']",N/A

To see pure conviction and sincere heroics.  See good men and women do good things not for pay, but for resolute compassion is very uplifting and inspiring.  It may be ""another superhero movie"", but there's a depth to it I did not expect when seeing it on the big screen the first time.  Living in a world where many of us resigned ourselves to just surviving day to do, it was a good encouragement being reminded that there are people ""who just don't like bullies""...where the little guy did not give up on his dream and purpose - even when stopped at every corner.

1462343,A2ICW5OUWX2A2V,B005IZLPKQ,Ian,"[2, 4]","Marvel seems to be resembling Pixar as of late, considering how they've made so many high quality movies, and success after success at the box office, with a seemingly unbroken string of great superhero films, from Iron Man, to the Incredible Hulk, and Thor.  One would think after a while, their luck would run out, and a sub-par film would be break the chain of hits.  Thankfully, with the release of, ""Captain America:  The First Avenger,"" that string remains unbroken.""Captain America:  The First Avenger,"" tells the story of Steve Rogers, a scrawny weakling desperate to get into World War Two, despite his tiny form and long list of health problems.  Feeling left out when his friends and his country head off to war, he's offered the chance to join a program that may help him become a powerful super soldier, and help change the course of the war.  Jumping at the task, he quickly finds himself confronting what may be the Nazi's most powerful figure, and weapons that could end the war, and not in favor of the allies.What makes ""Captain America"" so great is that it knows exactly what it sets out to be:  A homage to the serials of the 30's and 40's, in the vein of Raiders of the Lost Ark (there's even a clever nod to it early on).  Combining elements of war films, science fiction, and pulp fiction, ""Captain America"" is a near perfect blend of all three, with great action scenes, an awesome retro feel, and a nice sense of humor.  There's nary a weak note to be found here, as the cast is strong all throughout, with Chris Evans portraying a hero who has no ego, and only wants to do the right thing, and Hugo Weaving proving once more that he can play bad guys like no one else, embodying the scientific madness of the Red Skull.  To top it off, the visuals and production values are top notch throughout, and the film really does feel like a comic book come to life, with each new action sequence outdoing the last.If I had to nitpick, the only real flaw in the film is a a romance subplot between Steve Rogers and Peggy Carter that I felt was unnecessary.  But even then, the film seems to realize the same thing, as it doesn't go very far, a fact that I'm glad for.  ""Captain America"" focuses on constantly providing thrills and adventure, and succeeds wonderfully.  While it does feel a bit long, I didn't mind in the slightest.  If anything, I wanted to see even more of Captain America's world, as this is a film filled with optimism, where the good guys are good, the bad guys are bad, and there's no grim and grittiness that so often drenches today's heroes.I could keep raving about the action, the costumes, the humor, but I'll leave it at this:  ""Captain America"" is now one of my favorite superhero films.  It knows what it wants to do, doesn't deviate from the path, brings all of it's elements together, and provides a light hearted escapism that the world so desperately needs.

Lots of action, nice character development (once again, with more films in mind), a great blend of evil characters - the Red Skull is one of the more fiendish baddies ever, right next to Dr Doom and the hordes of Hydra were nicely done as were the giant sets, massive aircraft etc...Great production efforts, a good mix of WWII related action and Hydra-inspired weaponry and the right mix of explosions that didn't overwhelm the storyline.As next year's Avengers epic is due summer of 2012 which could produce the biggest film series since 'Star Wars' if done correctly. The money is there, the fan base is there and the potential for some terrific action sequences is right around the corner.As for Captain America, pretty enjoyable, my wife is from the Philippines and had never heard of Cap before enjoyed the efforts and asked me all sorts of questions about him.

That branch lead by Smidit is called ""Hydra"". Meanwhile back in the states a frail young man named Steven Rogers is trying to enlist but due to his medical state he can not join.

Steven is transformed from a frail man into a perfect solider. However word has gotten back to HYDRA that the Americans have created a super solider has killed Dr. Erskine. With Steven the only product of Erskine work he is dubbed Captain America and sent to try and raise the spirts of the America people. Feeling that he isn't doing enough he finds that his best freind Bucky Barnes who went on to Eurpoe before him has been captured by Johann Smidit along with other soliders to work in his facotries.

These days (yeah, I'm showing my age) I believe that the movies studios are addicted to CGI and special effects, they just don't know when to stop, and just because you can do ANYTHING you want in a movie today, most definitely dosen't mean you should do it. (see Spielberg films, Transformers, et al).  SO, Captain America, in my humble opinion, does show some restraint on the ""popcorn"" front.  Is it a popcorn movie?  yes it is.  But it sure helps having one of the greatest comic book villains of all time, The Red Skull, superbly played by Hugo.

Not so good if you are looking for an adult version of Captain America.Captain America's nemsis, the Red Skull, has possibly the worst and the most fake looking nose I have ever seen. The main female character plays an US Army Officer with noticeably strong British accent. The motorcycle chase scene reminded me of the MotoRacer game on my iPhone (this is not a compliment).Captain America is never in danger of being killed, injured, or even getting his suit dirty because, well, he is Captain America. He deals with his enemies like a video game character with only about 3-4 moves that are constantly repeated. Moreover, Captain America is just too cool to use guns (except once) to kill the enemies. He just uses his shield and knocks out his enemies like a real hero. In the Marvel Comic world, real heros don't use guns and seldom kill, even if the character is an Army Captain fighting the Nazis in WWII.I didn't think this was a particularly bad movie (hence the 3 stars). I would have seriously enjoyed this movie if I was 12. But grown-ups tend to like slightly different movies, and movie like this just is not one of them.FYI, I really enjoyed Superman (1978), Spiderman 2, and Batman Returns.

1462362,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B005IZLPKQ,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[8, 11]","For a long time now, Captain America has been my favorite Marvel comics character. He's just awesome. He's been a little on the dark side, particularly during the 80's, when it was required that EVERY superhero comic went through a dark phase, and with some of the recent Brubaker era work, Steve Rogers has seen some serious stuff go down. What Joe Johnston did with this film, and how it not only differentiates itself from all of the other Marvel films (not just the Marvel Studios films, but all films based on Marvel characters), but also how well it works, is how unapologetically sincere and earnest it is.Without exception, all of the other Marvel-based films have had their fill of post-modern cynicism and self-referential humor, and I'm not really knocking it. For the most part, it's suited the films well, particularly X2 and SPIDER-MAN 2. But this is a film set in the 1940's, and it's about a young man who believes so much in the ideals of his country and who so badly wants to make a difference, he's willing to put his own life on the line to potentially change it.Most of the heroes in the comic book world are accidents, or some tragedy drives them, or they were born different and were ostracized for their oddities, but Steve Rogers is a hero long before he ever became Captain America, and the exceptional performance of Chris Evans sells that. If there had been a moment of this film that broke from the era to include a line of dialogue that was post-modern humor, it would have utterly broken the back of this film, but thankfully screenwriters Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus (with a little help from Joss ""God"" Whedon in a few scenes) never retreat to modern dialogue tropes in order to keep the audience interested. They never make the film totally wooden or sullen either. There is great fun to be had with this film, and you gotta love the little RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK references in it. Also the cast in and of itself is quite good, particularly Stanley Tucci as Abraham Erskine. I honestly get choked up in the scene Erskine and Rogers share in the barracks the night before the experiment. It's my favorite scene of the film, because it gives you time to connect with the characters on an emotional level without any flash or gimmicks.

Well, in this movie scientists change him into a big manly man because he respects strength, unlike guys who have always been strong. We see that our hero may be scrawny, but he's brave, patriotic and tenacious..the very traits those scientists are looking for.It's a challenge to find a politically correct villain, so Nazis, lacking their own anti-defamation league, are a handy target for this Marvel Comics- based 3D CGI fest. Get ready for storm troopers, vintage warfare, Stealth bombers (?!) and LOTS of blowie uppie stuff.Let's look at the troops:* Chris Evans (&#34;The Nanny Diaries&#34; the Harvard Hottie) seems so darned LIKABLE! He is a perfect Captain America, object of derision, exploitation and ultimately, adulation.* Hayley Atwell (&#34;The Duchess&#34; the Other Woman) can run with WWII troops and shoot a machine gun without wearing a helmet, which would muss her hair.* Tommy Lee Jones (&#34;The Company Men&#34; the crabby guy) is a skeptical Army top kick with all the funny lines.* Stanley Tucci (&#34;Burlesque&#34; Cher's loyal sidekick) is the wise scientist who selects our 97-pound weakling.* Derek Luke (&#34;Antwone Fisher&#34; he was Antwone) is one of our hero's loyal cadre of troopers.* Samuel L.

The story is involving but not complicated; the language is PG-13 and often funny; there are no sweaty bodies or car chases; but I only ducked once, so to me, the 3D is optional.I enjoy seeing characters from other Marvel Comics who appear here, and the final scene is a blatant setup for the next chapter of this fledgling franchise.

1462371,A20IPZQ38M96RB,B005IZLPKQ,J. Bakker,"[9, 11]","After a hell of a lot of hype, Captain America: The First Avenger is finally in theaters. It delivers on the hype and goes even beyond that, turning star Chris Evans into a bona fide leading man. Captain America is among the best of the comic book movies released this summer. It's a lot better than Green Lantern, a bit better than Thor, but not quite on the level of X-Men: First Class.The trail to The Avengers is blazed by director Joe Johnston, and he and Chris Evans bring style and substance to a character that I previously couldn't give a damn about. I've always thought of Cap as just a bit too hokey, too much of a cookie-cutter symbol of USA patriotism and old-timey square-jawed superheroes. I remember smiling when I learned that Evans was cast in the role; if anyone could bring genuine charisma to the character of Steve Rogers, it was the former Johnny Storm (and Lucas Lee!).The  film starts out in a barren arctic landscape, where a group of government officials have discovered something buried. The site is excavated, and before Cap's shield is discovered, my brother turned to me and asked, ""Are we in the right movie?""Then the film smash cuts to WWII-era New York City, where we meet our hero Steve Rogers for the first time. If you haven't seen the trailers (unlikely), you will be taken aback a bit by the CG wizardry put to work to attach the always-buff Evans' head to a seriously scrawny, short body. Even as a gaunt  punching bag, Evans imbues his character with a likability that is integral throughout the movie. With a lesser actor in the lead, this movie wouldn't be half as good.We are shown Rogers' undying patriotism as he continually applies to be shipped overseas as a soldier. He is constantly turned down due to his tiny physical stature and myriad health problems. He is overheard by Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci) while talking to his buddy Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) and defending his drive to join the army. Dr. Erskine sees unwavering spirit of Rogers, and offers him a chance to fight for his country- a serum that he has designed, which can turn an ordinary man into the perfect soldier. Tucci does a great job making Dr. Erskine feel like a person, not a throwaway character, in the short screen time he is given. He believes in Rogers, and Steve spends the rest of the movie trying to live up to his expectations and make him proud.Dr. Erskine tells the story of Dr. Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving), also known as The Red Skull and Cap's main enemy in this movie. Dr. Erskine's super soldier serum was discovered by Schmidt, who, as a power hungry man, demanded to be the first test subject. It turns out that the serum brings out the inner qualities of the man; a good man's qualities become better, while in the case of The Red Skull, he was horribly disfigured. Ever since Erskine defected to the US, Schmidt has tried to track him down and kill him, because he knows that if he is able to make another super soldier, it will be the one thing capable of stopping his plans for global domination.Tommy Lee Jones is great as an Army Colonel that continually tears down Steve Rogers both before and after his superhero transformation. Hayley Atwell plays the romantic interest, and has great chemistry with Evans. Her character is there to comfort Steve when he is distraught about the fact that, after his transformation, he is relegated to putting on a silly spandex costume (the original Captain America uniform) and parading around in a stage show to help sell war bonds (some of the funniest scenes in the movie happen here). After being booed, humiliated and lambasted by troops serving in Italy, he decides enough is enough and to go on a one-man mission to rescue P.O.W.'s at a nearby camp, and finally gain the respect of his fellow soldiers.After that, the movie is mostly just about Captain America taking down Red Skull, until a heartstring-pulling ending that sets up The Avengers. All in all, it was a great summer popcorn flick, and a real star-making vehicle for Chris Evans. Marvel has done a great job in casting all of the Avengers, and it's one more movie I can't wait for next summer.

Not only is this a smart and sometimes emotional film, but it's nice to see a hero actually be a hero. Even when Steve Rogers turns into Captain America, he still holds onto his morals throughout the movie. The special effects were very convincing. The movie is set in the 1940s but also has a futuristic feel to it. If you are a die hard fan of Captain America you will not be disappointed. I would rank this movie as one of the best super-hero movies right under The Dark Knight. Make sure you watch the credits because there is a trailer for The Avengers which comes out in 6 months.

1462391,A131XK438X81X9,B005IZLPKQ,"Jerod Lytton ""TechCineFoodie""","[0, 0]","Cap makes his solo appearance in this fantastic entry into the Avengers percursor film with a sock to Hitler's Jaw. Besides fantastic jobs in casting and performance, the ambiance of the film lends to a more classic tone backed by war propoganda and nods to the wartime fascination with advancement of science and technology. The wizards of the CGI department took Chris Evans from a ripped beefcake, to a 90lb runt, then back to full glory. After &#34;Flaming On&#34; as the Human Torch, many doubted his ability to perform a dual role, as it were, into another Superhero costume. In his portrayal, and rightfully so, I feel he played more as Steve Rogers and less as Captain America. He makes you look to the man at the core, the heart behind the shield, and the gentleness under the muscles. In making the classic cut, polite, All American Man stand ahead of the hero he becomes, he portrayed a vision of what we would exemplify as a representation of an ideal America in its values and character.Hugo Weaving delivers masterfully as the Red Skull, as not an over the top evil doer ala Dr. Doom, but as a depitction of the evil genius promoted from a Nazi Germany representation of what we envioned as the evil of our WW2 enemy. He has the smarts, determination, and ruthlessness to pull off a maniacal menace without making it look like he was trying. Both before and after shucking his fake face, he never had to sell you on the appearance, as that is not what made him devious or powerful.The environments, vehicles, costumes, and set pieces are a brilliant mix of 40's/50's World of Tomorrow mixed with classical American flair, and a dash of James Bond. The romantic subplot hints just enough to make it a tangible force, and the star supporting cast makes each character memorable and indespensible. Not only is it great to see a hero who unquestionably stands for what is right, it was great to see he did not need to a &#34;Dark Hero&#34; or live in a crime ridden metroplis. He lived the motto, &#34;With Great Power, Comes Great Responsibilty.&#34;  while wearing the bold colors of the Red, White, and Blue.

1462406,A6X6LNZO1C3EZ,B005IZLPKQ,J. Munyon,"[9, 48]","I have to admit a lot of mixed feelings on this movie.  Samuel Jackson, Tommy Lee Jones, Hugo Weaving, Hayley Atwell, and a few others I recognized in this film notwithstanding, somehow this movie cheapens the above and beyond super heroism of everyday men and women in the armed forces serving in hostile zones of combat.  Maybe it was different in WWI or WWII, but beginning with the Korean war, this country has had trouble welcoming their heroes returning from war - especially from Vietnam and since that time.  These days there are no ticker tape parades and cheering crowds who respect and honor the men and women who have watched their fellow soldiers die on the battle field.  There is widespread unemployment, a nation near bankruptcy, and a misery index as high or higher than when Jimmy Carter was president.  And this film won't make you feel good about being given a 4F rating by the Selective Service System registration office, if you honestly wanted to serve in the military.  So it is hard for me to rally behind a film that suggests our nation's finest require a super-chemistry enhanced hero to inspire them to enthusiastically face the enemy.  Especially if the country you're fighting in hates you being there.  But never mind all that, it's just a movie.  A movie about how drugs can make women fall in love with you, taking drugs and experimenting with drugs can make men who hate you willing to follow you as their leader and fight by your side for whatever mission you personally undertake, and taking drugs and experimenting with drugs will let you live over a hundred years and never physically age a single day.  The message in this film is that a sublevel romance that never finds fruition is enough to give somebody the inspiration to accomplish anything even far above and beyond human ability - no wait, that was the drugs, nevermind.  This movie has very little gore, predominantly has a lot of gun violence (more of what today's America desperately needs), a little bit of language but very tame by today's standard, and no female nudity.

1462407,A3NKFB39AIEN8W,B005IZLPKQ,J. O. Booker,"[3, 5]","I saw this film last night. Before I get to my review I want to address the editorial review on this page, which said that there wasn't a link from the period this story takes place to the future when Captain America is part, or leader, of the Avengers. That reviewer evidently did not see the very first and very last scenes in the film, which explain the process by which Captain America is frozen, then thawed in the future.Anyway (sorry for the spoiler but I had to get that out the way because I don't think it was fair of the reviewer to overlook these scenes), I confess that it's been a very long time since I had such a good time on a superhero film. The reason I enjoyed this film is because, for one of the rare times with these types of films, its human elements didn't take a back seat to the special effects. In fact, it was the other way around. The acting was very good as was the story, as believable as a story so preposterous as its presented, can be.Basically, the story takes place during WW2 and a rogue general in one of Hitler's divisions called Hydra has acquired an ancient energy source that has enabled him to construct the ultimate weapon. The only hope for the Western axis is to develop ""super soldiers"" starting with a short pencil-neck recruit named Steve Rogers who volunteers to be a guinea pig that will amplify both his physical and also his moral attributes.This is one very good film, far and away the fourth best superhero this decade behind Batman Begins, the Dark Knight, and Spider Man. They really took time getting into character development, it wasn't just Wham-Bam-Thank-You-Ma'am straight to the action, but there was a real story here and not just enough to justify special effects later on. I really appreciate the film's attempt to recreate that era, to make the film feel alien enough for me to believe that it happened in another time. As usual, both Hugo Weaving and Tommy Lee Jones were terrific, Weaving as the Red Skull, and Tommy Lee as the hard-bitten military guy. Like I said, this film is more story than action even though the action and cgi effects are very good in this film, and always feel appropriate for the situations in which they are used. I like the sepia look of the human parts of the movie and how this look contrasts with the scenes showing Captain America doing his thing. This is a great primer for next year's Avengers film and I hope that the creative team who put together Captain plays a part in that film.

So in turn, Dr. Erkstine (Stanley Tucci) with industry captain Howard Stark (Dominic Cooper) conducts an experiment on him that turns Rogers into an enhanced and more tougher version of himself including enhanced fighting skills and improved Stamina as he wields a shield made out of a rare metal as he becomes Captain America who is the first Avenger ever.

An improvement over the 1990 monstrosity, Evans was fantastic and Hugo was born to play RedSkull. The film is an action packed extravaganza that is quite true to the original Marvel comics of the 40s and 60s, i like how they used amazing digital make-up in the Benjamin Button tradition on Evan's character to make him a weakling which looked almost real and how Hugo's make-up was.

Yes, it's a comic book story, so there are unrealities that come with the territory - they make it what it is.  Still, providing the well known Nazi experimentation philosophy with bioengineering and advanced technology as a vehicle for super-weaponry and menacing villains was a great approach, and really clicks.  The entire development of Steve Rogers to Captain America from weakling to warrior god is completely engrossing and worth watching alone.  his selfless, kind, reserved character is never lost to his strength and cunning, true to the good doctor's last request.  I also really liked the ending:  something far different from the usual fare, with a sadness that fits quite well and only adds to the overall, satisfying experience.  The World War II setting was a brilliant way to establish a superhuman character, and the cinematography only complimented this idea.I did have to withhold one star, however, for the severely gapped plot.  Many demands are made of the audience to either assume or remember the old comic book back stories to fill in many holes.  this is otherwise also very noticeable in the romantic subplot.  this could have been much better developed without sacrificing or distracting from the rest of the story.  also, some action sequences seem to be incomplete and require the viewer to just figure out how a transition was made or a leap completed.  I think that an extended director's cut is definitely warranted; at least another 30 minutes is needed to smooth out this somewhat jagged storyline.other than that, I can definitely recommend this one for the fun-action-comicbook section of your collection.

1462427,A1DJMQJ3NY7TV5,B005IZLPKQ,Jordan David,"[2, 3]","It's harder than you would think to make an action adventure film based on the pulp simplicity of the old timers. More so now than ever before, action films have drawn upon each other from years - even months - past, all for the sake of placing a stake in present ideologies and notions of what these specific movies are meant to represent. It's limiting, but it can usually mean a quick buck or two for those limited directors who put a bit of effort into creating something moderately intriguing.And then, we have Captain America. Before I could begin to study an odd, nostalgic throwback into the very recent voids of American cinema, Joe Johnston did it for me. Joe Johnston's interpretation of Marvel's sanctuary isn't modern; it's hardly memorable. That said, if Captain America: The First Avenger is anything, it isn't nauseously replicated by experiences months past. It is retro, such is the word that is used so seldom. There are things that a CGI unit can do to evoke such an effect: Grain filters, washed out colors, light blooming; that said, it doesn't necessarily work under the circumstances that most modern films are granted - or, perhaps, burdened - with. Johnston has an eye for these intangibles, not the least of which is dedicated to his work on both the Mummy and the Rocketeer, two completely safe and secure action films which helped to epitomize the 90's before bullet time dominated the scene.It is wholly pulp, characeristically old fashioned, and almost painfully short sighted, but that's where all of the charm seems to lie, anyway. More than anything, Chris Evans' work needs to be applauded. Drawing his own line between insecure empathy and a hoax patriotism of sorts, Evans works well with a role which would be seemingly inflexible, allowing the audience to witness a progression of maturity from what is, perhaps, the most iconic superhero of all. There really isn't much else to say about the performances: Weaving is a hopelessly evil sociopath with superhuman tendencies, Tommy Lee Jones offers some comic relief, and there's a love interest. As far as situational awareness presents itself, these are the basics.Plenty of this is complemented by a massive, exuberant atmosphere which evokes the majesty of the American 40's extremely well. This is most definitely where Johnston and company shine, and it's no surprise, given his extensive track record. Buildings are massive, explosions are pretty, and people die with dignity. It would be hard to call it anything other than pure family fodder if not for Evans' performance, which seems to be a vessel for others to observe and be inspired by. Chris Evans is a man who understands both the innocence and the responsibility of a ""rising"" Captain America, which is undeniably a vital component in establishing a proper atmosphere.The imposing, impressive badass will come later; for now, Captain America is a man limited to his very clean and admirable philosophies, and it's as good a film as any to stem into Whedon's magnificent epic, ""The Avengers!""",3,Captain America:  The First Avenger,1324166400,"12 18, 2011",2011,3045,"['harder', 'would', 'think', 'make', 'action', 'adventure', 'film', 'based', 'pulp', 'simplicity', 'old', 'timers', 'More', 'so', 'now', 'ever', 'action', 'films', 'have', 'drawn', 'other', 'years', 'even', 'months', 'past', 'sake', 'placing', 'stake', 'present', 'ideologies', 'notions', 'what', 'specific', 'movies', 'are', 'meant', 'represent', 'limiting', 'can', 'usually', 'mean', 'quick', 'buck', 'two', 'limited', 'directors', 'who', 'put', 'bit', 'effort', 'creating', 'something', 'moderately', 'intriguing.And', 'then', 'have', 'Captain', 'America', 'could', 'begin', 'study', 'odd', 'nostalgic', 'throwback', 'very', 'recent', 'voids', 'American', 'cinema', 'Joe', 'Johnston', 'did', 'Joe', 'Johnston', 'interpretation', 'Marvel', 'sanctuary', ""n't"", 'modern', 'hardly', 'memorable', 'said', 'Captain', 'America', 'First', 'Avenger', 'anything', ""n't"", 'nauseously', 'replicated', 'experiences', 'months', 'retro', 'such', 'word', 'used', 'so', 'seldom', 'are', 'things', 'CGI', 'unit', 'can', 'do', 'evoke', 'effect', 'Grain', 'filters', 'washed', 'out', 'colors', 'light', 'blooming', 'said', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'work', 'circumstances', 'most', 'modern', 'films', 'are', 'granted', 'perhaps', 'burdened', 'Johnston', 'eye', 'intangibles', 'not', 'least', 'dedicated', 'work', 'Mummy', 'Rocketeer', 'two', 'completely', 'safe', 'secure', 'action', 'films', 'helped', 'epitomize', '90', 'bullet', 'time', 'dominated', 'scene.It', 'wholly', 'pulp', 'characeristically', 'old', 'fashioned', 'almost', 'painfully', 'short', 'sighted', 'where', 'charm', 'lie', 'anyway', 'More', 'anything', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'work', 'needs', 'be', 'applauded', 'Drawing', 'own', 'line', 'insecure', 'empathy', 'hoax', 'patriotism', 'sorts', 'Evans', 'well', 'role', 'would', 'be', 'seemingly', 'inflexible', 'allowing', 'audience', 'witness', 'progression', 'maturity', 'what', 'perhaps', 'most', 'iconic', 'superhero', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'else', 'say', 'performances', 'Weaving', 'hopelessly', 'evil', 'sociopath', 'superhuman', 'tendencies', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'comic', 'relief', 'love', 'interest', 'As', 'far', 'situational', 'awareness', 'presents', 'are', 'basics.Plenty', 'complemented', 'massive', 'exuberant', 'atmosphere', 'majesty', 'American', '40', 'extremely', 'well', 'most', 'definitely', 'where', 'Johnston', 'company', 'shine', 'surprise', 'given', 'extensive', 'track', 'record', 'Buildings', 'are', 'massive', 'explosions', 'are', 'pretty', 'people', 'die', 'dignity', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'call', 'anything', 'other', 'pure', 'family', 'fodder', 'not', 'Evans', 'performance', 'be', 'vessel', 'others', 'observe', 'be', 'inspired', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'man', 'who', 'innocence', 'responsibility', 'rising', 'Captain', 'America', 'undeniably', 'vital', 'component', 'establishing', 'proper', 'atmosphere.The', 'imposing', 'impressive', 'badass', 'will', 'come', 'later', 'now', 'Captain', 'America', 'man', 'limited', 'very', 'clean', 'admirable', 'philosophies', 'as', 'good', 'film', 'stem', 'Whedon', 'magnificent', 'epic', 'Avengers']",N/A

The problem is he's a 90-pound weakling with health problems, i.e. 4F material, more so than even George Bailey. He winds up in a special secret U.S. Army unit that is working on a super-soldier serum. He is selected to take the serum which turns him into a lean, sleek, taller fighting man. Of course an enemy spy sneaks in and blow up the equipment and shoots the head scientist, so Rogers is the only one of his kind. He fights against the Nazis and their special secret unit, Hydra, that has its own plans for world domination.The movie hits all the WWII tropes: liberating POW camps, jumping motorcycles, flying fortresses, attacking a train in motion, assaulting secluded mountain hideaways, moving plastic pieces on a giant table map, parachuting behind enemy lines, drinking in smoky bars, etc. etc. They come off not so much as cliches but as homages to the great WWII flicks that came before.Chris Evans gives a great performance as Steve Rogers. He communicates the decency and honesty of the character and is as convincing emotionally as physically. Hugo Weaving as The Red Skull gives a good performance though I couldn't shake the feeling his German accent was an imitation of Werner Herzog.

It was that year that I came across some moldy, badly withered copies of the original Golden Age Captain America comic books. The colorful costume, bizarre villains and intriguing cross between horror comics (ahead of its time in that respect) and an old fashioned heroic archetype was irresistible. I gathered them up and took them home, but never got the chance to actually read all of them as they were immediately discovered by my Mom (how do they do that?) and thrown out into the trash. While my exposure was fleeting, it was indelible. When I saw the uniform on the cover of The Avengers #4 I snatched it out of the rack and rushed home, reading the book every step of the way and repeating that read over and over for days. He was back, that mythical uniform bursting straight off the cover and into my age of the comic book. The Silver Age was finally going big time for me. This was a hero I could not resist, much like Spider-man, because the overarching theme was an intriguing mixture of dedication and doubt. Steve Rogers is a man out of his time, everything and everyone he loved either gone or changed so drastically as to be unrecognizable. He awakens in the world of today, having been buried in a sheet of ice since the waning days of WWII having met his apparent death along with his partner Bucky while on a mission. That is where the modern day mythos of Captain Americas' begins. But the back story, his origin, his ascendency to national icon and his epic confrontation with his opposite, The Red Skull is the story of this movie. It is told well with a great feel for the period combined with wonderful details from the Golden Age Marvel (Timely) universe. It is suitable for a wide audience range, the story is broad enough that the viewer does not have to be a fanboy to follow the plot and has enough insider touches and threads to delight the real fanboys. Captain America has some great effects, some very thrilling action scenes all tied together with a healthy dose of excellent acting. As a set up for the upcoming The Avengers it does not make a wrong move and it will certainly be followed by at least two more sequels.

1462444,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B005IZLPKQ,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[143, 181]","Well, the summer will soon be nearing its end, although the temperatures outside don't seem to agree. With the changing of the seasons also comes the inevitable conclusion to the summer of superheroes (that's what I dubbed it a few weeks back). And now, with the release of ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" this year's heroic reign over the box office for beloved comic book icons will soon be coming to a close.""Captain America: The First Avenger"" is the story of Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), a young man who wanted nothing more than to fight alongside the brave soldiers in World War II against the Nazi onslaught. After being rejected repeatedly due to his frail physique, Steve volunteered for an experimental treatment that would transform him into a living, breathing super-soldier. Meanwhile, a Nazi scientist named Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving) is attempting to harness power beyond anything this world has ever seen, and Captain America may be the only one strong enough to stop him.After so many entertaining entries this summer ranging from Marvel's ""Thor"" and ""X-Men: First Class"" to DC Comics' ""Green Lantern"", did the heroic summer end with a triumphant victory or a disappointing defeat?The answer, as evidenced by the movie's opening weekend box office victory over ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2"", combined with mostly positive reactions from critics, is that the summer of heroes definitely ends on a high note. And I for one wouldn't have expected anything less from the star-spangled avenger.Taking heavy cues from classic Hollywood escapism, the likes of which haven't been seen in quite some time, the film embraces its more traditional atmosphere without being heavy-handed or cheesy in the process. Written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"") this film easily feels right at home in the ever-expanding pantheon of Marvel's self-produced comic book movies, but with some noticeable differences in storytelling.One of the big differences you'll notice, aside from the aforementioned atmosphere, between this movie and the ones Marvel Studios has released prior (including this summer's ""Thor""), is that the story is much more serious-minded than the others. The majority of the previous films tied into this universe featured serious dramatic story arcs, but always with heavy doses of humor laced throughout to keep things sort of light-hearted.That type of approach worked fine for those characters, and in the case of Thor it probably made his transition from comic book page to big screen that much easier to believe. However, for Captain America, a story filled with jokes, one-liners and sarcasm, even if they feel appropriate to the story, would have been completely wrong for the ever-stoic soldier and future leader of the Avengers.Thankfully, the writers paid attention to this (most likely with some heavy hints from Marvel) and avoided those mistakes. While there is still the occasional joke, they are few and far between; leaving us with a movie that captures the essence of Captain America perfectly. Plus, having a little joke here and there is good to break up the potential monotony of the drama unfolding, I was just glad Cap wasn't the one cracking wise.Another major difference between this film and the others, is that here we are presented with a hero who always dreamed of doing nothing more than fighting for what's right. In today's comic book movie landscape I can't think of any characters with this mindset. To me this was so refreshing because finally we get to see one of the few characters that's doing precisely what he's always wanted and sought after. As opposed to having the heroic mantle thrust upon him by circumstances (Iron Man or Spider-Man) or being born into it (Thor).Now, to clarify I am a comic book fan so I already knew that Captain America was one of the few heroes that willingly accepted the heroic mantle placed before him. I just wasn't sure if the movie would keep this aspect intact or change it to be more cookie-cutter and follow the tried-and-true recipe of so many of the other adaptations over the years.Despite my foreknowledge of that particular character trait for Cap, I still found it a fresh approach to a genre that has so many similarities within origin stories. After all, there are only so many types of origins one can tell before you become repetitive.One last difference with this film, that I shall touch upon briefly, is that this was a pure origin story from start to finish. With most other comic book films the origin portion of the character's first movie comprises approximately half to two-thirds of the overall running time. This movie doesn't finish Cap's origins for this cinematic universe, meaning taking him from first becoming the hero to being ready for next summer's ""Avengers"", until the credits roll.This was important because the other Marvel Studios movies featured stories set in the modern day; whereas, Captain America was created during World War II. So, for him to believably fit into the modern day landscape of 2012's ""Avengers"" team-up film, the movie had the unenviable task of introducing the character and doing justice to his time in World War II. All the while, somehow bringing him up to the modern day setting we've become accustomed to with the other films. Not an easy set of tasks, but one that the writers and director Joe Johnston pulled off quite nicely.Speaking of director Joe Johnston, I was personally a little skeptical when he was handed the reins to this key piece of the ""Avengers"" film puzzle. He's a director that has been hit-and-miss with big budget franchises or franchise makers throughout his entire career.Sure, he did an admirable job taking over for Steven Spielberg to helm ""Jurassic Park 3"", but even so, the movie wasn't as strong as its predecessors. Most recently he was responsible for what ended up being a snore-fest of a reintroduction to a classic movie monster with last year's ""The Wolfman"". But, after watching this film, I have to say that I don't know if anyone else could have handled the movie any better.Truth be told, whether you like or dislike some of the movies in Johnston's filmography, one thing is for certain, he may have been preparing for this movie his entire career. With his work on the two movies I mentioned a moment ago, and his history with visual effects during the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy, all of that served to prepare him for the numerous action sequences and vast CGI work necessary for bringing such a character to life. But, perhaps the most pivotal point of preparation for him may have occurred during his directorial work on 1990's ""The Rocketeer"".That film was by no means a financial success, and ultimately failed to kick-start a franchise for Disney. However, the movie's perceived shortcomings were not a fault of the director in my opinion. Reason being, the film was actually quite entertaining, but the marketing done by Disney was poorly planned and failed to really sell audiences on the vast adventure awaiting them inside the theater. Despite all that, the film's retro style, attitude, and timeframe are comparable to ""Captain America: The First Avenger"", and may have been the key to Johnston's success on this picture.Speaking of the film's success, much of the movie's box office victory over the final ""Harry Potter"" installment could easily be laid upon the shoulders of its star, actor Chris Evans. Even though Chris had already become known to comic book fans for his spot-on portrayal of the Human Torch, I personally believe that it will be his performance here, and in the sequels to follow (including ""Avengers""), that Chris will be remembered for in the eyes of comic book fans.Chris' portrayal is the perfect blend of idealism, strength, honesty, and authority that makes Captain America one of the purest heroes in comics and film. Now, it was a going concern among fans that perhaps Chris was miscast given his penchant for sarcasm. However, for Cap, Chris reportedly chose to remove several humorous lines of dialogue in order to stay true to the character. That choice was one that I personally appreciate, because it shows a respect for the source material; a trait which will always be pivotal to any comic book film's success.Fighting alongside Chris and serving as a potential love interest for Cap is actress Hayley Atwell (TV's ""The Pillars of the Earth""). Hayley brings a strong sense of authority to the role of Peggy Carter, but with a touch of vulnerability for being a woman amid a predominantly male setting (i.e. fighting in a war). Not to mention, a slight playfulness that belies the soldierly outward appearance and exposes a young woman who would at times like nothing more than to flirt with a guy, namely Steve Rogers/Captain America.In the other major supporting roles are some terrific actors; such as, Tommy Lee Jones (""The Fugitive""), Stanley Tucci (""The Road to Perdition""), and rising star Dominic Cooper (""Mamma Mia!""). Each of these supporting players is responsible for the film's few humorous bits, while still delivering very entertaining, solid performances.As always veteran actors Tommy Lee Jones and Stanley Tucci elevate any project they appear in, but it is Dominic Cooper that surprises me the most. His portrayal as Howard Stark (Tony Stark's father) is great, especially as he infuses shades of Robert Downey, Jr's portrayal of Tony from the two ""Iron Man"" films. For me this nod to his future son's personality further cemented the cohesive nature of these interlinked films that Marvel has been producing over the last few years.Now, I mentioned that Captain America was a great hero and Chris Evans perfectly captured all of the qualities necessary to make him so; however, every hero is only as great as his villain. For this purpose, actor Hugo Weaving brings the supremely evil and despotic Johann Schmidt, also known as the Red Skull, to sadistic malevolent life.When playing a character codenamed Red Skull, and one that has the physical qualities to inspire such a moniker, I think it could conceivably tempt an actor to sort of ham it up. Basically, go into a scene-chewing mode as the sneering bad guy who does everything evil just for kicks and all that's missing is a handlebar mustache for him to twirl in his fingers. Thankfully, as with many other potential pratfalls that could have plagued this movie, this one was avoided as well.Actor Hugo Weaving, who is no stranger to playing a major villain (he was Agent Smith in ""The Matrix"" trilogy), portrays Schmidt in a way that is obviously sinister, but without becoming an over-the-top caricature. This was vital to making his character more believable to audiences given his garish appearance and thirst for other-worldly power beyond belief.What I mean is that his motives are deeply twisted and malevolent, he is a Nazi after all, but you see the sincerity in how deeply he believes in what he's doing. That he's not just doing these evil things just for the sake of doing them. He has a purpose and he believes it to be right. Thus, as a character he is much more believable, amidst all of the more outlandish elements surrounding him, including his own appearance. Again, just another aspect that was pivotal to making this film work.After all that being said, as I mentioned earlier, the summer of superheroes definitely ended on a high note. Plus, with a movie this solidly entertaining, featuring a home-grown hero, to bring the season to a close is perfectly fitting.So, as you have undoubtedly figured out by now, ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" is an excellent adventure film. And one that serves as a fun throwback to classic escapism from Hollywood's past. The movie easily lives up to its Marvel Studios predecessors and firmly cements this hero from a bygone era's place in this hyper-real cinematic universe that began back in 2008's ""Iron Man"".""Captain America: The First Avenger"" is rated PG-13 for violence and brief language.",5,The Star-Spangled Avenger Has Arrived...,1312070400,"07 31, 2011",2011,12076,"['Well', 'summer', 'will',

The casting is phenomenal. Chris Evans absolutely shines as the lead, a role he plays brilliantly. He's understated and humble. He seems like a real man, someone we could see ourselves in. Stanley Tucci is fantastic. There is no other way for Stanley Tucci to be. Hugo Weaving again plays the bad guy, and we realized why he does. He plays creepy and terrifying better than anyone. Other roles include Tommy Lee Jones as the non believing skeptic, which he plays flawlessly, Hayley Atwell brings female strength and gusto as Peggy Carter, Dominic Cooper captures a very Robert Downey Jr. esque cocky sarcasm, which is fantastic as he is playing his father, Sebastian Stan is wonderful as Caps loyal sidekick Bucky, and an almost unrecognizable Richard Armitage plays the German agent assigned to disrupt the Rogers experiment.

It was no award winner--just good entertainment and on an incredibly humid 105 degree day in Baltimore (yuk).  I don't remember any foul language either.  It was a war movie, so people got shot and killed everywhere, but they did not focus on blood and guts, thank God!  I saw it in 3D, but I don't believe the 3D really added much.Steve Rogers, from Brooklyn NY, is a guy who wants to join the military and serve his country so bad he can taste it.  It is March, 1942, so WWII is going strong.  Steve is pretty small and ""puny,"" and gets rejected 4F every time he applies.  He is in the right place at the right time when a scientist overhears him about to apply again and decides Steve is perfect for a secret government experiment.  Steve is classified 1A by Dr Abraham, given a special serum injection, and he becomes a lean-mean (muscular) fighting machine.  His metabolism is about 4 times faster than other guys, his muscles are expanded at the cellular level, and he can run fast as heck, jump on top of taxis, and stuff like that.  We are told early on that the puny guy was selected because he had a good heart and the serum amplifies the inner characteristics a person already has.  Initially, Steve becomes part of a War Bond show for the army, but as you would have guessed anyway, soon finds a way to get in the war.The evil force is Nazi Johann Schmidt (aka Red Skull), who is looking for a way to win the war for Germany and Herr Hitler.  Tommy Lee Jones is a military commander, also involved in the secret project, and as always, is exceptionally good in his role.  Federal Agent Peggy provides an Army Girl presence, quite capable of kicking butt. There is also a pleasing innocence about Steve's character.Lots of action--It is probably more of a ""guy"" movie (generally) because it is primarily a war movie.",3,"USA 10, Nazi's 1",1311379200,"07 23, 2011",2011,1901,"['was', 'pretty', 'happy', '2011', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'release', 'theaters', 'was', 'award', 'winner', 'just', 'good', 'entertainment', 'incredibly', 'humid', '105', 'degree', 'day', 'Baltimore', 'yuk', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'foul', 'language', 'either', 'was', 'war', 'movie', 'so', 'people', 'got', 'shot', 'killed', 'everywhere', 'did', 'not', 'focus', 'blood', 'guts', 'thank', 'God', 'saw', '3D', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', '3D', 'really', 'added', 'much.Steve', 'Rogers', 'Brooklyn', 'NY', 'guy', 'who', 'join', 'military', 'serve', 'country', 'so', 'bad', 'can', 'taste', 'March', '1942', 'so', 'WWII', 'going', 'strong', 'Steve', 'pretty', 'small', 'puny', 'rejected', '4F', 'time', 'right', 'place', 'right', 'time', 'when', 'scientist', 'apply', 'again', 'decides', 'Steve', 'perfect', 'secret', 'government', 'experiment', 'Steve', 'classified', '1A', 'Dr', 'Abraham', 'given', 'special', 'serum', 'injection', 'lean-mean', 'muscular', 'fighting', 'machine', 'metabolism', 'about', '4', 'times', 'faster', 'other', 'guys', 'muscles', 'are', 'expanded', 'cellular', 'level', 'can', 'run', 'fast', 'heck', 'jump', 'top', 'taxis', 'stuff', 'are', 'told', 'early', 'puny', 'guy', 'was', 'selected', 'had', 'good', 'heart', 'serum', 'inner', 'characteristics', 'person', 'already', 'Initially', 'Steve', 'part', 'War', 'Bond', 'show', 'army', 'would', 'have', 'guessed', 'anyway', 'soon', 'way', 'get', 'war.The', 'evil', 'force', 'Nazi', 'Johann', 'Schmidt', 'aka', 'Red', 'Skull', 'who', 'looking', 'way', 'win', 'war', 'Germany', 'Herr', 'Hitler', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'military', 'commander', 'also', 'involved', 'secret', 'project', 'always', 'exceptionally', 'good', 'role', 'Federal', 'Agent', 'Peggy', 'Army', 'Girl', 'presence', 'quite', 'capable', 'kicking', 'butt', 'also', 'pleasing', 'innocence', 'Steve', 'character.Lots', 'action', 'probably', 'more', 'guy', 'movie', 'generally', 'primarily', 'war', 'movie']",N/A

Many of them are quick but easily noticeable. An additional 5 effects made it to 20% or more.IN SCREEN / OBSERVATIONS:The cardboard cutout syndrome is glaringly noticeable early in the movie and in A FEW other scenes throughout the film with only 1, 2 or 3 depths and a flat background. The balance of the scenes converted well and only appeared slightly shallower in depth than normal and the syndrome was negligible.If you like action type films, it is easy to overlook the shortcomings of a (fake 3D) conversion and enjoy this movie for what it is.

Hunter,"[2, 3]","""There is something ludicrous in the idea of so educating a generation which is born to the Ogpu [State Police in the USSR] and the atomic bomb. Since it is so likely that they will meet cruel enemies, let them at least have heard of brave knights and heroic courage. Otherwise you are making their destiny not brighter but darker."" (C. S. Lewis ""On Three Ways of Writing For Children,""On Stories: And Other Essays on Literature, 39)The best part of this movie, hands down, is Steve Rodgers BEFORE the vita-ray treatment.Consider the 90-pound asthmatic Steve Rodgers. He is persistent. He wishes to honor the life and death of his father. And he understands appropriate deception. This is understandable and forgivable, considering his chicken-little body, and his lion's heart. These are all heroic qualities.Then consider two of the three tests he passes before the vita-ray/super soldier serum treatment. The first is intelligence. He solves the flag-pole problem and gets the girl. Rodgers is not ""scientific smart"" like Reed Richards (Fantastic Four) or Howard and Tony Stark (Iron Man 2 (Single-Disc Edition)). But he is shrewd, wily, and clever, like Samson (the riddles in Judges 14) and Hercules (the Twelve Labors were tests of brains as well as brawn). And he needed to pass ""the brains"" test before he became the New Hercules for the New World.The second test clinched the deal. Our 90-pound weakling was the first on the hand grenade. ""Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends"" (John 15:13). And his self-sacrifice was so instinctive! No thought, no doubt, no ""refusal of the call,"" just quick action in the right direction.The last test was the one Samson failed, the test of chastity in the face of a buxom vixen. Forget Camelot's ""Fie on Goodness,"" this is vintage Tennyson: ""My strength is as the strength of ten, Because my heart is pure.""

1462477,A120V3RVSK1O1K,B005IZLPKQ,K. Ostrowski,"[15, 22]","I rarely watch movies in theaters anymore, because I just don't enjoy most of the ones coming out nowadays.  Still, I heard from a reliable source that this movie was good, so I checked it out.  I figured it might tingle my Catholic sense the way Spider-man 2 did, or it might not, the way Iron Man did.  Still, I knew there was a chance that it might really be good.  I love the true-blue hero types like Captain America, and I love the older comic books on which this kind of adventure is based, so I checked it out.First, let me start off by saying that the movie gets a lot right.  A period piece set in the times of the 1940s near the end of the second world war, a wimpy little guy called Steve Rodgers wants to be a soldier more than anything, but no matter what he tries, he just can't seem to pass the army's tough recruitment guidelines.  Enter a military scientist; originally from germany, who promises to give him a chance to be in the army, by means of an experimental formula, which amplifies all the natural powers of his body to the absolute peak of human potential and, perhaps, beyond.  Rodgers undergoes the procedure and becomes Captain America; fighting in the war to protect his friend Bucky, and the other brave soldiers on the front lines.  Much action and adventure ensue.  This ultimately leads him into conflict with the Red Skull; a supervillain in charge of Hydra; a nazi splinter-group that uses advanced technology derived from a strange, recently-discovered power source.The list of differences between this movie and the comics it was based on would go on for days, and don't really matter anyway.  In the comics, Bucky wore a costume too, but his role was otherwise the same, and frankly, I agree with this change.  Bucky didn't undergo the procedure, so it doesn't really make a whole lot of sense for him to be CA's sidekick in a movie like this one.The content of this movie pleased me greatly in some ways.  There was relatively little cursing, the violence and death didn't get gorey (though in a story about war, there will never be a lack of death,) and the closest thing to sexual content was a woman yanking CA's necktie and kissing him.  The action is a little goofy at times, and overall, is has about the same vibe as a cartoon with more military types in it, which will appeal to some, and not to others.  I know some who were hoping this would be a legitimate war movie, but I don't see how it could have been.The dialogue is rather standard fare, and the characters aren't terribly deep.  There's not much soul-searching, and the villain is rather two-dimensional.  In short, it wasn't Spider-man 2.  That said, I loved it, because this kind of storytelling really was popular a couple generations ago, when characters didn't have to be deep or excessively-complicated to be interesting.  Archetypes are strong and rarely deviated from in this movie, and I consider that a good thing, since when you get down to it, that's really what Captain America is about.  He's an archetype for the virtuous soldier.  Seeing him in that light, a whole slew of other things about the movie become clear.On one level, the main character demonstrates tremendous courage, strength of will, dedication, humility and care for his fellow man, yet he knows what kinds of tough choices have to be made in a time of war.  He's moral to a tremendous degree, which is enough by itself to impress me, but the film has other things hidden in it as well.In one scene, the doctor explains his reasons for choosing Rodgers as his subject; because he believed that strong men become used to their strength, and always want more, but weak men know the value of strength, and how to be good and true.  I don't care whether this was intended or not; this line sets up the rest of the movie as an allegory for Heaven; where only the most virtuous, couragious, humble people will go to be glorified, and receive new bodies, which can be used to help others.  That put a smile on my face when I thought of it in that light.Still, the movie isn't without its downsides.  The hydra group takes center stage as the villains very early on, and seems to be just about the only group of nazis that cap fights.  Maybe I misread that, but I felt like this was an attempt to sort of pidgeonhole our hero into his own little world, so he doesn't bother the rest of the war going on.  I would have preferred to see real nazis with real villain motivations, or even a thorough characterization of Hitler, but that might have been too much to ask for, considering the direction that modern world events are taking.There's one thing I'm sure of; this is a good movie, because it's a movie about good people doing good things.  It's no masterpiece, doesn't go too far into its characters, and the war action is, I feel, disrupted a bit by the odd technology being thrown around, but it's still a good film, and that's so uncommon nowadays, that I don't feel it would be right of me to give it less than four stars in any category.  It may not be very thought-provoking, but it's got its soul in the right place, and I couldn't be happier about it.",4,Water in the Desert for a Moral and/or Religious Man,1313798400,"08 20,

Captain America may not have the most complex characters in it, but the focus on Rodgers as a good guy rather then Captain America as a hero for the first part of the film feels heart felt and true. Having an under dog with a heart of gold isn't anything original, but this film isn't going for unique and gritty like many modern comic adaptations are. As for how everyone else does in their roles, there really isn't a stinker in the entire cast. Hayley Atwell is gorgeous and doesn't overdue the ""girl power"" thing, though I'm getting tired of the forced love interest in Marvel movies. Sebastien Stan plays a pretty serious and much more mature Bucky then I was expecting (honestly, who thought Bucky would even be in this movie?). Dominic Cooper's Stark has just enough Downey Jr in it to feel the connection, but not so much it feels like a rip off. As for Hugo Weaving, he does a great job with what he has, but not much of the run time is spent developing his character which is slightly disappointing. Most of the exposition on Red Skull is given through dialogue to Rogers, so we aren't given much to find interesting about his personality. Then again, it's a character named ""The Red Skull"", some one so bad even the Nazis think he's evil. Is there anything else you need to know?The visual effects are varied, with some being phenomenal (The weakening of Evans looks very convincing) to pretty horrendous ( much of the Cg movement (I.E the train scene) looks videogame-ey and fake). The costume designs work with what the source material gives, and the way they integrate Captain America's costume is pure genius. That goes for the campiness of the original comics as well. The movie never parodies it completely, but works it into the plot to push the action forward. All I'll say is Captain America does hit Hitler, sort of, and it's awesome.Finally, there is the action of the film to talk about. It encompasses a good part of the latter half of the film. The fight choreography is fine, as you'd expect from a comic movie, with some fun and unique uses of the shield. The amount of violence can be a bit surprising, as we see bullet holes rip though Hydra bodies and one man gets thrown into a propeller. It's nothing that will make you grabbing for the vomit bag, but it still feels a bit out of place in a film where the main character is so opposed to killing. Over all the action is well shot an engaging.Captain America ends up being a slight bit better then Thor, not quite as good as Iron Man, and totally worth watching.",4,Sergeant US of America!,1321488000,"11 17, 2011",2011,2643,"['ever', 'needed', 'proof', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'can', 'act', 'someone', 'other', 'then', 'douche', 'movie', 'Captain', 'America', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'most', 'complex', 'characters', 'focus', 'Rodgers', 'good', 'guy', 'rather', 'then', 'Captain', 'America', 'hero', 'first', 'part', 'film', 'feels', 'heart', 'felt', 'true', 'Having', 'dog', 'heart', 'gold', ""n't"", 'anything', 'original', 'film', ""n't"", 'going', 'unique', 'gritty', 'many', 'modern', 'comic', 'adaptations', 'are', 'how', 'everyone', 'else', 'roles', 'really', ""n't"", 'stinker', 'entire', 'cast', 'Hayley', 'Atwell', 'gorgeous', ""n't"", 'overdue', 'girl', 'power', 'thing', ""'m"", 'getting', 'tired', 'forced', 'love', 'interest', 'Marvel', 'movies', 'Sebastien', 'Stan', 'pretty', 'serious', 'much', 'more', 'mature', 'Bucky', 'then', 'was', 'expecting', 'honestly', 'who', 'thought', 'Bucky', 'would', 'even', 'be', 'movie', 'Dominic', 'Cooper', 'Stark', 'just', 'enough', 'Downey', 'Jr', 'feel', 'connection', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'rip', 'off', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'great', 'job', 'what', 'not', 'much', 'run', 'time', 'spent', 'developing', 'character', 'slightly', 'disappointing', 'Most', 'exposition', 'Red', 'Skull', 'given', 'dialogue', 'Rogers', 'are', ""n't"", 'given', 'much', 'find', 'interesting', 'personality', 'Then', 'again', 'character', 'named', 'Red', 'Skull', 'one', 'so', 'bad', 'even', 'Nazis', 'think', 'evil', 'there', 'anything', 'else', 'need', 'know', 'visual', 'effects', 'are', 'varied', 'being', 'phenomenal', 'weakening', 'Evans', 'very', 'convincing', 'pretty', 'horrendous', 'much', 'Cg', 'movement', 'I.E', 'train', 'scene', 'videogame-ey', 'fake', 'costume', 'designs', 'work', 'what', 'source', 'material', 'way', 'integrate', 'Captain', 'America', 'costume', 'pure', 'genius', 'campiness', 'original', 'comics', 'well', 'movie', 'never', 'completely', 'plot', 'push', 'action', 'forward', ""'ll"", 'say', 'Captain', 'America', 'hit', 'Hitler', 'sort', 'awesome.Finally', 'action', 'film', 'talk', 'good', 'part', 'latter', 'half', 'film', 'fight', 'choreography', 'fine', ""'d"", 'expect', 'comic', 'movie', 'fun', 'unique', 'uses', 'shield', 'amount', 'violence', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'surprising', 'see', 'bullet', 'holes', 'rip', 'Hydra', 'bodies', 'one', 'man', 'thrown', 'propeller', 'nothing', 'will', 'make', 'grabbing', 'vomit', 'bag', 'still', 'bit', 'place', 'film', 'where', 'main', 'character', 'so', 'opposed', 'killing', 'action', 'well', 'shot', 'engaging.Captain', 'America', 'up', 'being', 'slight', 'bit', 'better', 'then', 'Thor', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'Iron', 'Man', 'totally', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

A German doctor/scientist (the incredibly talented Stanley Tucci) sees the goodness within Steve and enlists him to join an experimental project.  Although Steve struggles with the physical training, he clearly has the most heart and is chosen to undergo the first procedure.As expected, the experiment goes off without fail (enter in Tony Stark's dad to provide the technology!) and Steve is transformed into a buff, unstoppable hero.  Unfortunately, the good doctor is killed and Steve is relegated to the menial job of selling war bonds.  So degrading!  He dutifully does his part until on one tour of Europe, he finds out his best friend and hundreds of other Allies are captured as POWs.  He must come to their rescue!  He must also battle a very bad guy, Red Skull (played by the masterfully evil Hugo Weaving), who seeks to control all of Europe with his futuristic technology.Chris Evans is amazing as Steve Rogers.  He played The Human Torch in Fantastic Four and it was not that great.  But he steps into the role of Captain America as if he was born to play it.  Captain America is the ultimate hero, brave and good-hearted.

It was based too much on an old-time mentality and I thought it was a little pat with the WWII hero paladin lead. In retrospect and after more viewing, I realize I was wrong. It's excellent. Chris Evans as the lead walks the very fine and treacherous line between being a too-nice, too-pure hero type and being just really likeable. The whole movie only works because they cast him, sort of like Thor only works because Chris Hemsworth was cast. The side characters here are all flawless in the roles they're given (though any more Hugo Weaving seems to do nothing but dramatic bad guys. Someone give the man a drama please. Not that he isn't great here). Standouts include Tommy Lee Jones doing what he always does but under the radar just a bit. He's as snarky as ever but he never steals the scene. And again--Chris Evans carries the movie by being exactly what Steve Rogers/Captain America needs to be: a little guy who hates bullies and never quits, trapped in the body of a pin-up boy. He makes the man seem real. So it all works.The BluRay has good extras too, with a commentary for those of us who care, and some really interesting production specials on how they made the very tall, very buff Chris Evans look like a short, skinny 90 pound weakling.

1462549,A3APW42N5MRVWT,B005IZLPKQ,"Michael Harbour ""mharbour""","[1, 2]","Update:I saw ""Captain America"" again for the third time. This time projected from a 35mm print and, while there are a few brief moments which were designed for 3D that aren't quite as cool in 2D, overall it is a much more rewarding experience than the underlit 3D presentations I saw. This is really a bright, colorful film with lots of detail in the action, sets, backgrounds, and facial expressions which are lost in the dimness of digital presentation. Well worth a second viewing if you can find someplace running it on film. I expect that the DVD and Blu-Ray will be closer to the brightness of film than the dimness of digital theatrical projection.Original post:Saw ""Captain America"" twice already. Both times in 3D (which ain't too shabby). Liked it the first time. Liked a lot better the second time - for a couple of reasons.The first is that I wasn't distracted reconciling the movie with the comics. The movie is very, very good but, likeThor, it has the job of filling in all of the back story needed for The Avengers in 2012 and there's a LOT more back story. Captain America really deserved Iron Man's two film lead in. And, as much as the movie does an impressive job adapting decades of story into two hours there are inevitable differences some of which were a bit jarring to me. On second viewing I could appreciate the movie for itself because I already knew where it differed from the stories I was familiar with.The second viewing, I saw the movie with my teenage daughter who knows almost nothing about the character and I was curious how she would respond to it. We, of course, stayed through the credits for the anticipated after credit scene and then this occurred:The movie ends. Daughter turns to me.Daughter: ""Really?""We stand and walk to the end of the row.Daughter: ""Really?""We walk up the aisle a bit.Daughter: ""An ad?""And a bit farther.Daughter: ""That's stupid.""A bit farther.Daughter: ""As if the people who stay through the credits aren't already waiting to see 'The Avengers'?""We exit the theater and in the lobby are four of her friends. They greet and hug and ask ""what are you seeing? and ""what did you see?""Friend: ""We're going to see Harry Potter again.""Daughter: ""Captain America""Friend: ""Cool. How is it?""Daughter: ""Ummm...""Friend: ""Oh. That good?""Daughter: ""Well ...""Friend: ""What would you rate it?""Daughter: ""Mmmm...three stars.""Friend: ""Oh.""The friends obviously have no interest in seeing Captain America now.Daughter: ""But stay 'til the end""Daughter: ""It's disappointing, but stay 'til the end.""The friends obviously now have less than no interest in seeing Captain America.We leave the theater, walking to the car.Daughter: ""That free-fall fight was cool!""Me: ""Yeah. I liked that a lot, too.""Daughter: ""I'd have probably given it four stars but that ad at the end was a dumb move.""Me: ""I liked the movie a lot more this time. I think because I knew what to expect and wasn't trying to reconcile the movie with the comics and I knew when the movie really ended and when to stop expecting more. I think the ad at the end colored my feelings about the movie, too.""Daughter: ""Yeah. When we sat through the credits and it said 'Captain America returns in The Avengers' I though 'We stayed for that?'. But then the tag and the ad played and I thought 'ending with 'Captain America returns in The Avengers' would have been better. Or ending after the little punching bag scene. It wouldn't have been GOOD, but it would have been BETTER.""The moral: Marvel Studios, which had been doing a great job building anticipation for The Avengers with the tag scenes after the credits which teased and enticed, went for the hard sell. I doubt that that hard sell is building audience because, as daughter said, ""As if the people who stay through the credits aren't already waiting to see 'The Avengers'?"" But the hard sell almost certainly lost the sale of four tickets to Captain America which daughter's friends had been interested in (and had both time and disposable income to spend for) because the Avengers ad disappointed her and unfavorably influenced her immediate response to the movie.Y'know, for good word of mouth you want to send people out on a high note, not feeling like they've been subject to a bait and switch; expecting the tradition of a cool teaser tag to continue in this movie but being delivered a tiny anemic tag followed by a routine and traditional ad.",5,Cool movie.

1462551,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B005IZLPKQ,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[2, 4]","On its surface, the Captain America character is pretty ridiculous. The name alone is rife with World War II jingoism that seems out of place in today's considerably more cynical and global world.  Director Joe Johnston smartly embraced the silliness that is a superhero with a giant ""A"" on his forehead through a mix of digital wizardry, American montages, and good old fashioned Nazi-punching.Steve Rogers (who first appears as a digitally-altered version of Chris Evans) is an asthmatic wimp with a hero's heart.  He can't fight for beans and he's been rejected from the Army four times, but that doesn't stop him.  Rogers may not be popular with the ladies but he's a moral man, a theme that will carry throughout the film. It's his bright soul that attracts former German scientist Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci) to Rogers for a top-secret super-soldier project.That project, initiated by Erskine under the funding of insane Nazi Johann Schmidt (played with feral menace by Hugo Weaving), is a super-soldier serum.  It has one side-effect however - whoever is injected with the glowing blue stuff gains super strength and endurance but also reveals his true self. Schmidt's face peels off, thus his moniker The Red Skull.  Once Rogers becomes the hero he always knew he could be, Captain America: The First Avenger really gets rolling.Until then, the scrawny, CGI-diminished form of Rogers is distracting.  I can't quite put my finger on it, but Evans just doesn't look right. Evans' booming voice betrays the deeply powerful body that it belongs to. But once Rogers is in Evan's true form, he is a wonder to behold.  The film literally hits the ground running once Rogers becomes Captain America.Lurking around the edges of Captain America is the idea of the ubermensch or superman.  It's interesting that the film completely avoids this topic; Erskine's genetic research was a real focus for both the German and U.S. governments.  Good old Cap is the Nazi ideal realized, but the script never goes there.The Nazi obsession with the reclamation of a Slavic identity is also missing.  In part, this was the motivation behind the Ahhenerbe quest for ancient artifacts proving German supremacy - the same quests that were made legendary in the Indiana Jones series.  There is mention of Yggdrasil, the Nordic tree of life, and the Tesseract, which fortunately is never actually named in the film. This cube, a boundless source of energy, funds all sorts of Schmidt's projects and it's not long before he turns against his Nazi overseers to launch his own splinter organization, HYDRA.Captain America is basically a guy juiced up on super steroids that runs around with a bull's-eye shield, and the film cleverly capitalizes on the larger-than-life comic book without disrespecting the pulp feel of an ugly war.  Rogers transforms from super-soldier to poster boy for America, and his ridiculous outfit comes complete with dancing girls.  This plays well in the States until Rogers is sent to the front lines to cheer up the troops, where he's jeered as a ""chorus girl.""The film never lets us forget this: superheroes are ridiculous enough in civilian life, but in war they're a dangerous liability.  Rogers has to prove himself every day to crusty Colonel Chester Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones, with some of the funniest lines in the film) and the beautiful-but-tough British Hayley Atwell (Peggy Carter).  Atwell's burgeoning romance with Evans centers the film; they're less star-crossed lovers than two kids just trying to go out on a first date in a war-torn world.Captain America, being a war film, has heaping measures of American optimism and personal loss.  The optimism is embodied by the Howard Hughes-like Howard Stark (Dominic Cooper, playing Tony Stark's father), who is the host of the World's Fair and inventor of Rogers' outfit.  When Rogers' best friend Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) is captured by HYDRA, it's propels Captain America to risk everything to rescue him. During that rescue mission Rogers gets a glimpse of a map with the locations of HYDRA's bases, leading to the final conflict as Captain America and his soldier buddies take down the wicked organization, one technologically-advanced Nazi at a time.It's hard not to love Captain America.  Ever respectful of its roots, it harks back to a time when America believed in the promise that anyone could be a hero at a time when the world desperately needed heroes.  Although it glosses over some rough edges, this is a film made by someone who clearly loved war films.  You can see the fingerprints of its pulp ancestors on everything from the lensing to the musical score to the brilliantly executed credits.  Captain America may be something of an anachronism in today's world, but this film does his reputation justice as a war hero.",4,Captain America: A Real American Hero,1319500800,"10 25,

However, I was never a big Captain America fan; he just never appealed to me in the way that other iconic superheroes like Spider-Man and Superman did, which was largely due to never feeling the character's personality was as clearly defined as it should be for such a premiere superhero, even after reading most of Ed Brubaker's run on the title, which is considered one of the most definitive runs on Captain America.What sold me on the experience and made me excited about seeing this movie was that moment in the third trailer when a grenade is tossed amongst Steve Rogers (Captain America) and the rest of the super soldier candidates and everyone else runs away from the threat while Steve's instinct is to protect others from it. This was the moment when I said, ""Oh, wow, they nailed it."" It will also undoubtedly go down as one of my favorite all time superhero movie moments.Chris Evans did an excellent job carrying the essence of that scene with him throughout the entire film, which makes Steve come off as genuine in a role that could have easily oozed corniness. I had faith in Evans ever since I saw his portrayal of a no-nonsense astronaut in Sunshine, and I'm glad to say he's silenced any critics who thought he couldn't dial back the wisecracking that he's known for and given Cap a different feel than Human Torch, having played both superheroes.You can say the same for the performances of the film's other stars like Stanley Tucci, Tommy Lee Jones, Hayley Atwell, and Hugo Weaving. There were a lot of moments and lines that this movie could have fumbled based on their concept, but the actors and creative team clearly bought into the idea of Steve wanting to serve and fight simply because it was the right thing to do.There are really only a couple of negatives with the film, the first being I thought Cap's fighting scenes could have been polished up a bit more and the second being I wanted a little more screen time for Red Skull.All things considered, I'd definitely say the thing that makes this the best Marvel Studios production since Iron Man is the heart, and I mean this in multiple respects. Too often a studio will churn out a big budget film like this and concentrate more on effects and merchandising than story and character development. After being disappointed by the lack of heart in DC's summer offering of Green Lantern, I'm hoping other superhero films and blockbusters in general will try to have as much substance to go along with the flash as Captain America.",4,Marvel's Best Since Iron Man,1314921600,"09 2, 2011",2011,2616,"[""'m"", 'big', 'time', 'comic', 'book', 'fan', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'see', 'theaters', 'ever', 'was', 'announced', 'However', 'was', 'never', 'big', 'Captain', 'America', 'fan', 'just', 'never', 'appealed', 'way', 'other', 'iconic', 'superheroes', 'Spider-Man', 'Superman', 'did', 'was', 'largely', 'due', 'never', 'feeling', 'character', 'personality', 'was', 'clearly', 'defined', 'should', 'be', 'such', 'premiere', 'superhero', 'even', 'reading', 'most', 'Ed', 'Brubaker', 'run', 'title', 'considered', 'one', 'most', 'definitive', 'runs', 'Captain', 'America.What', 'sold', 'experience', 'made', 'excited', 'seeing', 'movie', 'was', 'moment', 'third', 'trailer', 'when', 'grenade', 'tossed', 'amongst', 'Steve', 'Rogers', 'Captain', 'America', 'rest', 'super', 'soldier', 'candidates', 'everyone', 'else', 'away', 'threat', 'Steve', 'instinct', 'protect', 'others', 'was', 'moment', 'when', 'said', 'Oh', 'wow', 'nailed', 'will', 'also', 'undoubtedly', 'go', 'down', 'as', 'one', 'favorite', 'time', 'superhero', 'movie', 'moments.Chris', 'Evans', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'carrying', 'essence', 'scene', 'entire', 'film', 'Steve', 'come', 'off', 'genuine', 'role', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'oozed', 'corniness', 'had', 'faith', 'Evans', 'ever', 'saw', 'portrayal', 'no-nonsense', 'astronaut', 'Sunshine', ""'m"", 'glad', 'say', 'silenced', 'critics', 'who', 'thought', 'could', ""n't"", 'dial', 'back', 'wisecracking', 'known', 'given', 'Cap', 'different', 'feel', 'Human', 'Torch', 'having', 'played', 'superheroes.You', 'can', 'say', 'same', 'performances', 'film', 'other', 'stars', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'Hayley', 'Atwell', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'were', 'lot', 'moments', 'lines', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'fumbled', 'based', 'concept', 'actors', 'creative', 'team', 'clearly', 'bought', 'idea', 'Steve', 'wanting', 'serve', 'fight', 'simply', 'was', 'right', 'thing', 'do.There', 'are', 'really', 'only', 'couple', 'negatives', 'film', 'first', 'being', 'thought', 'Cap', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'polished', 'up', 'bit', 'more', 'second', 'being', 'wanted', 'little', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'Red', 'Skull.All', 'things', 'considered', ""'d"", 'definitely', 'say', 'thing', 'best', 'Marvel', 'Studios', 'production', 'Iron', 'Man', 'heart', 'mean', 'multiple', 'respects', 'Too', 'often', 'studio', 'will', 'churn', 'out', 'big', 'budget', 'film', 'concentrate', 'more', 'effects', 'merchandising', 'story', 'character', 'development', 'being', 'disappointed', 'lack', 'heart', 'DC', 'summer', 'offering', 'Green', 'Lantern', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'other', 'superhero', 'films', 'blockbusters', 'general', 'will', 'try', 'have', 'as', 'much', 'substance', 'go', 'along', 'flash', 'Captain', 'America']",N/A

The hero, for example, starts out being a physical weakling, but he has admirable heart and unstoppable determination.  When he becomes a physical superhero, the qualities that make you love him do not change; he just becomes a winner with much bigger obstacles to overcome.  Stanley Tucci's character is lovable and well played; this is my favorite of all the characterizations I've seen him in, and I feel his talent shines forth in this role.  It was sad that the character exited so early in the film, although the filmmakers managed to keep his spirit alive throughout the film, so he is not forgotten.  The action is outstanding, even for me; I am not particularly drawn to action films.  It keeps moving, and it is not just a rehash of all the action films you've seen before; it has a few interesting twists.  I also liked the hero's friend, although his character was not developed as much.  Visually, the movie is gorgeous, with a variety of scenery and excellent camera work.  The characters are more real and warm because of the way they are filmed, and the action is equally more riveting for the same reason.  Some of the scenes are breathtaking.  What really catapults a movie from mediocre to outstanding is how the characters are portrayed, and in this movie you care about the characters.

This film cost $140M to make and yielded a tad over $365M at the box office. A sequel is expected but THE AVENGERS (which will appear many of the Marvel Heroes) is going to be released beforehand. Critics were generally positive about this film. This picture was nominated for a number of awards and the 2011 Scream Awards gave it Best Superhero. As usual watch the credits to see a sneak peek at a future Avengers film.WHEN WATCHED: October 2011; STORY/PLOTTING: B; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus to A minus; IDEALS: B; ACTION SCENES: B; OVERALL GRADE: B to B plus.BEST DIALOGUE (possible spoilers): Timothy 'Dum Dum' Dugan: Are you sure you know what you're doing? Steve Rogers: Yeah. I punched out Adolf Hitler 200 times. ///[flipping through Steve's file] Dr. Abraham Erskine: Where are you from Mr. Rogers?  Mmm? Is it New Haven? Or Paramus? Five exams in five different cities. Steve Rogers: That might not be the right file. Dr. Abraham Erskine: No, it's not the exams I'm interested in. It's the five tries. But you didn't answer my question. Do you want to kill Nazis? Steve Rogers: Is this a test? Dr. Abraham Erskine: Yes. Steve Rogers: I don't wanna kill anyone. I don't like bullies. I don't care where they're from. Well, there are already so many big men fighting this war. Maybe what we need now is the little guy, huh? /// [to Steve] Dr. Abraham Erskine: So many people forget that the first country that the Nazi's invaded was their own. You know, after the last war the...my people struggled. They...they felt weak. They felt small. And then Hitler comes along with the marching and the big show and the flags and the...and the... [he waves his hand] Dr. Abraham Erskine: And he...he hears of me, my work and he finds me. And he says, you...he says you will us strong. Well, I am not interested. So he sends the head of Hydra, his research division. A brilliant scientist by the name of Johann Schmidt. Now, Schmidt is a member of the inner circle and he's ambitious. He and Hitler share a passion for a cult power and Teutonic myth. Hitler uses his fantasies to inspire his followers. But for Schmidt it is not fantasy. For him, it is real. He has become convinced that there is a great power in the earth, left there by the Gods, waiting to be seized by a superior man. So when he hears about my formula and what it can do, he cannot resist. [flashback of how Schmidt takes Erskine's formula and injects himself with it] Dr. Abraham Erskine: Schmidt must become that superior man. Steve Rogers: Did it make him stronger? Dr. Abraham Erskine: Yeah. But, there were other effects. The serum was not ready. But more important, the man. The serum amplifies everything that is inside. So, good becomes great. Bad becomes worse. This is why you were chosen. Because a strong man, who has known power all his life, will lose respect for that power. But a weak man knows the value of strength. And knows compassion. Steve Rogers: Thanks.

Captain America as a character never interested me that much.  I liked him the Ultimate Avengers animated movies, but I liked most the other superheroes on the team more.  I will say that the film is the one of my least favorite phase one movies.  However, that does not make Captain America bad.  I still thought the film was entertaining and Chris Evans did surprise me.  I thought he was bad in Fantastic 4 so I had little hope here.  However, he was able to pull-off the character rather nicely.The story is as follows.  A man named Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) wants to be a great soldier but gets gravely dismissed and underestimated because of his size.  He then volunteers for an experiment which makes him a Super Soldiers known as Captain America.  He then joins the Special Forces to fight the Nazi organization called HYDRA led by another Super Soldier called Red Skull (Hugo Weaving).  He is joined by his sidekicks Bucky Barnes, Peggy Carter, and Colonel Chester Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones).The film does accomplish most of what it is set out to do.  Captain America is an entertaining character especially when he is throwing his shield around.  The action scenes are decent although not up-to-par with action scenes in Iron Man, Thor, or Incredible Hulk.  The side characters are decent especially Colonel Phillips.  Tommy Lee Jones is great in every role he plays, even if the film itself is bad.  I really liked his character, and he was quite funny.  The majority of the funny moments in the film involve him.The one issue I have is the CGI in the film.  The CGI is not horrible, but there are times when it is off particularly in the fights and it can take me out.  Compared to the effects in Iron Man and Thor, the effects in this are not up-to-par.  Also, the film can drag a little in places, but that is more of a nitpick.Overall, Captain America is an entertaining film and worth your time.  If you are getting into the MCU and want to see Avengers then you should watch this film (as well as the other phase one films) first to get more of an understanding.  It is one of my least favorite phase one movies but it is still good.

I suspect they will continue to get made until we stop going to see them.  The Marvel cast of superheroes eventually becomes a gang called The Avengers.  This film is about a 1945 young man who wants to get into the fight against Hitler and the Nazis.  Because he is small and frail, he is always rejected by the Army.  He is being observed however, by members of a small group of scientific government types as a subject for an experiment to make a super soldier.  He is Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) and becomes The Chosen One (he he).The experiment works but soon after, everything is destroyed by a Nazi infiltrator.  We get a high dose of wizardry in terms of exotic weapons, especially from an ultra Nazi called Red Skull.  Yep, he has one too.  I really liked that.  Assuming you can get past the re-creation of WW II, ""CA"" has much to offer.  First, the retro look of the film is a welcome departure from the more futuristic style of most films of this ilk.  Like the ""X-Men"" prequel of a few months ago, the acting is very good.  Chris Evans in particular is well suited to this role.  He gives Rogers/Capt. America a nice guy/Superman image, complete with a sense of humor.  Does this film rank as one of the best of the genre?  Well, not quite.  It's better than the ""Greens"" but not as good as ""Thor"" or the aforementioned ""X-Men"".1-2-12: Blu ray update - The DTS HD Master Audio soundtrack is excellent with window rattling explosions but also subtle enough to show off the score from Alan Silvestri.

I liked the fact that it was set during WWII, which made this comic book adaptation unique, and it has a fair amount of humor that never seemed forced.The acting is better than you would expect thanks to a surprisingly restrained performance from Chris Evans as Captain America and a scene stealing Tommy Lee Jones. Hugo Weaving does his usual good job as the villain Red Skull, but I didn't find him to be menacing enough to stand out from all the other comic book baddies. Still, he always plays the evil roles so well. Hayley Atwell, who I had previously seen in the TV miniseries The Pillars of the Earth, is not only gorgeous, but a better than average love interest. She actually fights, rather than just standing around looking pretty.There is a lot of CGI and most of it looks good, especially the scrawny version of Chris Evans, but thankfully it is not overused like in The Green Lantern.The only negatives would be that it does drag a little in spots and the hero himself doesn't have any cool powers (like The X-Men) or any cool gadgets (like Batman), other than a kicka** shield that can be thrown like a boomerang. He is just stronger and faster thanks to an experiment that turns a 90 pound weakling into a 220 pound beat down machine.I had fun with this one.

But, when a particular scientist takes note of his determination and amazing goodness, Steve is recruited to be the subject of a groundbreaking super-soldier experiment that transforms him into ""Captain America: The First Avenger"". From there on, we follow Captain Rogers as he struggles to take his fight from the home front propaganda circuit to the battle overseas, where he finds himself up against the original guinea pig of the super soldier syrum, the megalomaniacal Red Skull, leader of Hydra, an organization formerly tied to the Nazis, but now running purely under Red Skull's control.When I first went to see 2011's ""Captain America: The First Avenger"", I was pretty psyched. I've never been a reader of the comics, but I've always been a fan of the more famous superheroes due to being a huge cartoon and film fanatic. There is a derogatory term comic fans have for such screen-based superhero fans as myself, but I can't remember it just now (for the record, I have always read comics, just not superhero ones; I would like to catch up with them someday). I've been a huge fan of the Marvel films since they started up with the X-Men, Spider-Man, Hulk, and Fantastic Four franchises, and things really got kicked up a notch when ""Iron Man"" came along as the first in this line of films leading up to the currently in theaters ""The Avengers"".  All 5 preceding films and The Avengers itself have been excellent to varying degrees, but ""Captain America"", in my opinion, is one of the best. This is largely due to the excellent casting, performances, retro-styling, music, and great Joe Johnston direction (this is the man who gave us The Rocketeer, another great, retro superhero film, as well as other excellent works like Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, which I still love to revisit on DVD). Now, when I first saw the film, I have to admit, I was more enthralled by the first two thirds than the final act. That's not to say there is anything wrong with that final act, but knowing only a limited amount about Captain America going into the film, both myself and my date expected it to be a bit more superhero-ish than it was. It was really more military offensive type stuff. Totally appropriate and well done, but for us, who are not war movie types, the story of Steve Rogers' transformation into Captain America and the relationships he makes were more fascinating. Rewatching the film more thoroughly on Blu-Ray, however, without being partially focused on how much my date was enjoying the film, ha, I find the later portion of the film much more engaging than I originally thought, and the whole thing is just a masterfully done piece of entertainment. Again, though my knowledge about the characters is limited, they seem wonderfully translated to the big screen. Nothing hokey looking about Red Skull at all, and Hugo Weaving is fantastic in the role! Chris Evans in the lead could not be better, either, and the special affects used to make him appear puny in the first part of the film are just amazing (they look much better in 2D than in 3D, as I remember seeing it on the big screen). Hayley Atwell does a wonderful job as Cap's love interest and military superior, Peggy Carter, and  it's great to see Tommy Lee Jones in the Marvel cast of characters here too, playing a hard (on the outside) Colonel as perfectly as you'd expect him to. There are plenty of other noteworthy cast members (always enjoy Toby Jones in films, and Stanley Tucci as well, he brings so much to this film), but it really is enough to say that everyone is excellent (and one of those Captain America chorus girls always catches my eye, but I won't take the space to try to specify which one).""Captain America"" is a fantastic film, particularly because of the great job it does with the retro qualities and bringing such potentially campy characters to life without slipping into that hole even slightly. Most of the Avengers-fueling films have done a great job with that, and I hope D.C. takes a lesson from this and starts working towards a proper Justice League film (though I have great concern, as they have yet to prove they can get the balance just right, no matter how awesome the Nolan Bat films are). Oh, and on the subject, I just love how all these films have been tied together (who hasn't loved that?), with S.H.I.E.L.D., Nick Fury, Stark Enterprises (Dominic Cooper is a hoot in this as a young Howard Stark, Iron Man's dad),  and Phil Coulson popping up everywhere. The Blu-Ray is a must have if you are a Marvel fan or even just a fan of Word War II era films. It is brilliant in both respects. The movie looks and sounds great, and it comes with a fine set of bonus features: The best of the Marvel One-Shot short films (A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer), a collection of featurettes and trailers, some deleted scenes, and a commentary by Director Joe Johnston, Director of Photography Shelly Johnson, and Editor Jeffrey Ford. The commentary is not the most fascinating one I've heard, but still good, and the featurettes are great as behind the scenes material. If you were a fan of ""The Avengers"" and plan to buy it when it comes out, you need to own this one too, and I certainly hope you've seen it by now. Don't forget to pick up Iron Man 1 and 2, Thor, and The Incredible Hulk as well! That's the Edward Norton ""Incredible Hulk"", not the Eric Bana ""Hulk"", though I still say Bana's is a good film too, even if it's not AS good.PS: As a bit of extra, interesting info I just looked into, aside from animated works, Captain America has been onscreen in two 1979 TV movies (now on DVD), and on the big screen in a 1944 serial and a 1990 film not released in the States except on VHS. It seems the general consensus is that none of these are very good, though I still wanna see them and would love to own the serial if they'd ever release it. Anyway, thankfully, we now have a truly great Captain America film in ""Captain America: The First Avenger"", not to mention ""The Avengers"", and ""Captain America 2"" is scheduled for 2014.",5,Brilliant and Beautiful!,1338508800,"06 1, 2012",2012,6307,"['1940', 'exceptionally', 'brave', 'noble', 'good', 'patriotic', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Steve', 'Rogers', 'desperate', 'join',

1462585,A20OMCGB73X5LV,B005IZLPKQ,Moon Donkey,"[1, 6]","This movie has a lot of problems.  SPOILERS.First of all, the character of Steve Rogers (Captain America) is supposed to be pure of heart, but he comes across as merely childish.  He is innocent to the point of being stupid.  I never got the impression that he was ""good"" in the way Superman is good - out of deep moral conviction.  Rather, Rogers was ""good"" more like a puppy is good.Also, many of the plot details were just sort of lame.Starting from the beginning - Rogers is a runt who becomes a super soldier after being injected with a formula.  However, the scientist who invented the formula is killed, and the formula itself is destroyed immediately after the experiment.  Therefore, the general in charge decides that Rogers would be better off selling war bonds than being a soldier.  Wait... huh?  The general originally wanted an entire army of super soldiers, but now he has only one.  Well, Rogers is still a super soldier, so why not use him for that?  Nope - the general figures he isn't worth it so a politician signs Rogers up to for an acting job with a bunch of showgirls.  Huh?Moving on... when Rogers goes out on his own to infiltrate the Hydra base, he does so with his Captain America stars and stripes shield strapped to his back.  Huh?  Who tries to sneak into an enemy base with a big `ol America flag hanging off of their back?  That's just dumb.Did anyone else find the selection of the ""new"" shield particularly silly?  Stark (the father of the Stark who is Iron Man) designs several shield designs for Rogers and then gives him a choice.  Rogers looks over the selection on the table, but then notices a circular shield stashed away under the table.  Rogers is like - hey... what's this... I like this one.  Starks response is - oh no... you can't have that one... it is made of a very ""special"" metal and that shield represents all that there is in the entire world.  Of course, this is the shield Rogers ends up with.Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.  Are you telling me that there are only a few pounds of this ""special"" metal and that the best thing the scientists could think up to do with it is to fashion it in the shape of a metal disk?  Also, why the heck was it under the table in the first place?  If it is a shield, then put it on the table for Rogers to pick.  If it is not available, don't hide it under the table.  Or, if you are actually trying to hide it, don't do such a sloppy job of it so that any fool walking by would just see it sticking out.Anyway - regardless of all this silliness, the nutshell of the plot is that Captain leads American troops to take out a bunch of Hydra bases around Europe.  ""Hydra"" is a branch of Nazi Germany - except it isn't... it is really more like Cobra or something.  The leader of Hydra is a dude with a red skull who was the subject of the first super soldier experiment.  The red skull guy comes into possession of an ancient artifact of the gods that provides basically unlimited power to make laser weapons and such.  He intends to use this power to destroy the world - including Nazi Germany.  Why?  Who knows... that really isn't clear - he is just evil.  Go with it.  It also isn't clear how Nazi Germany came up with the funds and resources to build all of these Hydra bases in the first place.So here we have the basic outlines of the plot.  The good guys go after each base and beat the bad guys who, even though they have great weapons, can't figure out how to shoot straight.The climax comes when Rogers has to defeat the red skull guy on his stealth bomber of death which is heading toward the US to bomb the whole Eastern coast.  To save the US (and the world I suppose), Rogers decides he must crash the ship in order to stop it... and for some reason he must pilot it all the way into the ground himself.  Uhhhh... why can't he just smash the controls and then fly off the plane in one of the dozens of little bomb jets that are on board?  Why does he have to go down with it?  Oh wait... that's the only way we can get him to freeze so he can wake up in the future.This movie wasn't terrible, but it was far from great... or really even good.",2,Captain puppy dog,1324512000,"12 22, 2011",2011,4158,"['movie', 'lot', 'problems', 'SPOILERS.First', 'character', 'Steve', 'Rogers', 'Captain', 'America', 'supposed', 'be', 'pure', 'heart', 'merely', 'childish', 'innocent', 'point', 'being', 'stupid', 'never', 'got', 'impression', 'was', 'good', 'way', 'Superman', 'good', 'deep', 'moral', 'conviction', 'Rather', 'Rogers', 'was', 'good', 'more', 'puppy', 'good.Also', 'many', 'plot', 'details', 'were', 'just', 'sort', 'lame.Starting', 'beginning', 'Rogers', 'runt', 'who', 'super', 'soldier', 'being', 'injected', 'formula', 'However', 'scientist', 'who', 'invented', 'formula', 'killed', 'formula', 'destroyed', 'immediately', 'experiment', 'Therefore', 'general', 'charge', 'decides', 'Rogers', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'off', 'selling', 'war', 'bonds', 'being', 'soldier', 'Wait', 'huh', 'general', 'originally', 'wanted', 'entire', 'army', 'super', 'soldiers', 'now', 'only', 'one', 'Well', 'Rogers', 'still', 'super', 'soldier', 'so', 'why', 'not', 'use', 'Nope', 'general', 'figures', ""n't"", 'worth', 'so', 'politician', 'signs', 'Rogers', 'up', 'acting', 'job', 'bunch', 'showgirls', 'Huh', 'Moving', 'when', 'Rogers', 'out', 'own', 'infiltrate', 'Hydra', 'base', 'so', 'Captain', 'America', 'stars', 'stripes', 'shield', 'strapped', 'back', 'Huh', 'Who', 'sneak', 'enemy', 'base', 'big', 'ol', 'America', 'flag', 'hanging', 'back', 'just', 'dumb.Did', 'anyone', 'else', 'find', 'selection', 'new', 'shield', 'particularly', 'silly', 'Stark', 'father', 'Stark', 'who', 'Iron', 'Man', 'several', 'shield', 'designs', 'Rogers', 'then', 'choice', 'Rogers', 'selection', 'table', 'then', 'circular', 'shield', 'stashed', 'away', 'table', 'Rogers', 'hey', 'what', 'one', 'Starks', 'response', 'oh', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'one', 'made', 'very', 'special', 'metal', 'shield', 'entire', 'world', 'course', 'shield', 'Rogers', 'up', 'with.Wait', 'minute', 'wait', 'minute', 'wait', 'minute', 'Are', 'telling', 'are', 'only', 'few', 'pounds', 'special', 'metal', 'best', 'thing', 'scientists', 'could', 'think', 'up', 'do', 'fashion', 'shape', 'metal', 'disk', 'Also', 'why', 'heck', 'was', 'table', 'first', 'place', 'shield', 'then', 'put', 'table', 'Rogers', 'pick', 'not', 'available', 'do', ""n't"", 'hide', 'table', 'are', 'actually', 'trying', 'hide', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'such', 'sloppy', 'job', 'fool', 'walking', 'would', 'just', 'see', 'sticking', 'out.Anyway', 'regardless', 'silliness', 'nutshell', 'plot', 'Captain', 'American', 'troops', 'take', 'out', 'bunch', 'Hydra', 'bases', 'Europe', 'Hydra', 'branch', 'Nazi', 'Germany', ""n't"", 'really', 'more', 'like', 'Cobra', 'something', 'leader', 'Hydra', 'dude', 'red', 'skull', 'who', 'was', 'subject', 'first', 'super', 'soldier', 'experiment', 'red', 'skull', 'guy', 'possession', 'ancient', 'artifact', 'gods', 'basically', 'unlimited', 'power', 'make', 'laser', 'weapons', 'such', 'use', 'power', 'destroy', 'world', 'including', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'Why', 'Who', 'really', ""n't"", 'clear', 'just', 'evil', 'Go', 'also', ""n't"", 'clear', 'how', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'came', 'up', 'funds', 'resources', 'build', 'Hydra', 'bases', 'first', 'place.So', 'here', 'have', 'basic', 'outlines', 'plot', 'good', 'guys', 'go', 'base', 'beat', 'bad', 'guys', 'who', 'even', 'have', 'great', 'weapons', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'shoot', 'straight.The', 'climax', 'when', 'Rogers', 'defeat', 'red', 'skull', 'guy', 'stealth', 'bomber', 'death', 'heading', 'US', 'bomb', 'whole', 'Eastern', 'coast', 'save', 'US', 'world', 'suppose', 'Rogers', 'must', 'crash', 'ship', 'order', 'stop', 'reason', 'must', 'pilot', 'way', 'ground', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'smash', 'controls', 'then', 'fly', 'off', 'plane', 'one', 'dozens', 'little', 'bomb', 'jets', 'are', 'board', 'Why', 'have', 'go', 'down', 'Oh', 'wait', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'get', 'freeze', 'so', 'can', 'wake', 'up', 'future.This', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'was', 'far', 'great', 'really', 'even', 'good']",N/A

Cap is a film of moments- Hugo Weaving's Red Skull frantically working a huge bank of controls to fry his superiors with a ray gun, Chris Evans bombing his USO routine to a camp of war-weary soldiers, and a dozen other instants of cinematic brilliance are icing dollops on a very sweet cake.One feels honestly that this is the kind of movie they would have made about Captain America in the 40s if they could have. And while it contains innumerable little tidbits to appeal to Avengers followers and comic fans in general, it remains accessible to the casual moviegoer as well. If I had one complaint about this film it would be that there are really too many characters and too much plot for just one film- Cap deserved two movies just like Iron man, and I hope that down the line, he'll get them.With this set you get the movie on BD and DVD, so you can take it to your mom's house where they haven't updated their home theater in eleven years. Extras are pretty sparse and consist mostly of little promotional tidbits that were already available online- it's my theory that all the really juicy bonus content is being saved for some kind of boxed set after Avengers comes out. The movie itself is a lovingly faithful transfer that will not disappoint anyone, but probably won't blow you away either- this is a very straightforward film without a lot of hidden details or secrets. Still, a lot of work went into these sets and digital backlots, so best to see it all, eh? Audio is appropriately bombastic (I love me some Silvestri) but like the Iron Man films, the music is rather loud in proportion to the voices- no problem if you watch it LOUD.",5,"Fun, Charming, and Smarter Than You'd Expect",1329523200,"02 18, 2012",2012,1955,"[""'ll"", 'cop', 'being', 'little', 'underwhelmed', 'Thor', 'Captain', 'America', 'was', 'next', 'Avengers', 'film', 'was', 'more', 'little', 'worried', 'Thankfully', 'concern', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'baseless', 'Joe', 'Johnston', 'same', 'bouncing', 'retro', 'panache', 'here', 'used', 'such', 'brilliant', 'effect', 'Rocketeer', 'Cap', 'film', 'moments-', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'Red', 'Skull', 'frantically', 'working', 'huge', 'bank', 'controls', 'fry', 'superiors', 'ray', 'gun', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'bombing', 'USO', 'routine', 'camp', 'war-weary', 'soldiers', 'dozen', 'other', 'instants', 'cinematic', 'brilliance', 'are', 'icing', 'dollops', 'very', 'sweet', 'cake.One', 'feels', 'honestly', 'kind', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'Captain', 'America', '40s', 'could', 'have', 'innumerable', 'little', 'tidbits', 'appeal', 'Avengers', 'followers', 'comic', 'fans', 'general', 'accessible', 'casual', 'moviegoer', 'as', 'well', 'had', 'one', 'complaint', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'are', 'really', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'too', 'much', 'plot', 'just', 'one', 'film-', 'Cap', 'deserved', 'two', 'movies', 'just', 'Iron', 'man', 'hope', 'down', 'line', ""'ll"", 'get', 'them.With', 'set', 'get', 'movie', 'BD', 'DVD', 'can', 'take', 'mom', 'house', 'where', 'have', ""n't"", 'updated', 'home', 'theater', 'eleven', 'years', 'Extras', 'are', 'pretty', 'sparse', 'consist', 'mostly', 'little', 'promotional', 'tidbits', 'were', 'already', 'available', 'online-', 'theory', 'really', 'juicy', 'bonus', 'content', 'being', 'saved', 'kind', 'boxed', 'set', 'Avengers', 'out', 'movie', 'lovingly', 'faithful', 'transfer', 'will', 'not', 'disappoint', 'anyone', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'blow', 'away', 'either-', 'very', 'straightforward', 'film', 'lot', 'hidden', 'details', 'secrets', 'Still', 'lot', 'work', 'went', 'sets', 'digital', 'backlots', 'so', 'best', 'see', 'eh', 'Audio', 'appropriately', 'bombastic', 'love', 'Silvestri', 'Iron', 'Man', 'films', 'music', 'rather', 'loud', 'proportion', 'voices-', 'problem', 'watch', 'LOUD']",N/A

For nearly all of the character's publication history, Captain America has been the alter ego of Steve Rogers, a frail young man who was enhanced to the peak of human perfection by an experimental serum, in order to aid the United States government's efforts to win World War II. Captain America wears a costume that bears an American flag motif, and is armed with an indestructible, boomerang-like shield that can both be thrown as a weapon, and defend against others' weapons.Unlike the comic book, the transformation of Chris Evans into Captain America is complete. He is never Private Rogers after that and this is where the film takes a risk but it pays off. In the film the chemical transformation is very risky and death defying. Evans is convincing.

1462605,A250AXLRBVYKB4,B005IZLPKQ,"Nathan Beauchamp ""ConsumerAdvocate (nathan(at...","[6, 10]","I expected a lot from CAPTAIN AMERICA considering it got very good reviews from critics and moviegoers alike. I am in the minority in that I did not find it to be that great of a movie. My reason is pretty simple: the movie is packed with amazing special effects, is stylish, rich, and honestly looks fantastic. Unfortunately the characters are a major let down.To have a good protagonist, you need a few things. One is a special skill, ability, or other reason to like them that differentiates them from secondary characters. Maybe they are a great leader (Patten), have a brilliant mind (Sherlock Holmes), are athletically gifted (Chariots of Fire), etc... They also need a good weakness, something that shows their human side. Sherlock is a dope fiend. Patton can't see the basic human needs of his soldiers. You get the idea. It's the interplay of the greatness and the weakness that makes them interesting and fun to root for. Luke Skywalker is likeable as much for his massive potential as a Jedi as for his naivety and occasional stupidity.As far as I can tell, Captain America's only weakness is that he started out very weak. That's cured in the first 15 minutes of the movie, leaving a character so virtuous, powerful, and convincingly good that the central question of his ultimate success is never in doubt. He is stronger, faster, and just so gosh darn-it likeable that his larger struggles against Red Skull and his minor romantic complications seem overbearingly devoid of risk. You could argue that his being overlooked as a soldier and turned into a marketing piece for the Army would constitute a weakness, but that is an external factor, not an internal one. I wanted his former psychology of being the little guy, the weak one, the picked on, to take him interesting places. Not create an emotional shambles, but at least present challenges for him. What do you do when you suddenly have the power you never experienced before? I wanted to see him make a few mistakes and learn from them.Couple that with weak secondary characters most of which are introduced messily (the united nations team of misfit soldiers, all of whom seem modeled of someone else, rather than actually being someone themselves are the prime example), and you have a movie with a lot of pop and little substance.The story is average, but feels too full of stuff with nothing really explored that well. Red Skull had the potential to be frightening, but he basically whines to his minions when things don't go his way, hides, or escapes. He only faces Captain when Captain forces the issue, and again, it's resolved so quickly and easily, the audience never has to worry about the outcome. Antagonists should be frightening, not just unlikable. Contrast Red Skull with the most recent incarnation of the Joker from THE DARK KNIGHT if you want to know exactly what I mean. The Joker terrified because he was not dependent on anyone else, because he had gravitas, because he was so much the antithesis of Batman. Red Skull is just a Nazi with incredible strength. He's no more or less frightening than a normal man with normal abilities.I would argue Captains' finest antagonist would be a character who is strong through his mind and devilishness, not brute strength. Someone to juxtapose the raw Tim Tebow-ness of Captain against malicious forethought and planning. I wanted Captain up to his eyeballs in stress, fighting for his life against traps and dirty tricks. Give him meaningful, complicated choices that expose the man under the Red-White-and-Blue.All in all CAPTAIN AMERICA was an ok movie. I did not hate it. I just did not find it fulfilling.

The last stand-alone film from Marvel Studios to set up next year's mega-super hero opus The Avengers, Captain America stars Chris Evans (who funny enough played The Human Torch in the two forgettable Fantastic Four films) as the titular star-spangled hero, who takes on the Red Skull (Hugo Weaving) during World War II in an effort to stop his nefarious scheme and his evil Hydra organization.  What makes Captain America so enjoyable is the fact that director Joe Johnston (The Wolfman, The Rocketeer) injects so much heart and soul into the otherwise pedestrian script, and the fact that Evans himself is surprisingly enjoyable in the title role without falling into the kind of cockiness/self-referential performance that often accompanies his roles.  Hugo Weaving is great, and Tommy Lee Jones steals the show as well, but in the end we all know what this really is meant for: The Avengers.  And by the time the end credits roll, you'll be salivating for it like never before.

Stan was responsible for the Captain's revival back in the mid- 1960's.  Ironically, a  1990 feature film version of the Captain prominently displayed Lee as the creator.Captain America was one of the first to show the element of genetic engineering or ""super serum"".  The movie shows character actor Stanley Tucci as the German scientist who recruits Steve (Chris Evans) Rodgers for his experiment. The scientist wants a humble man who ""knows the value of strength"".  He wants a man who knows failure and weakness. He doesn't want an ego maniac who could turn into another Adolph.On the other side of the globe, the Red Skull (Hugo Weaving)is preparing an attack on the U.S.A. and overthrowing Hitler.  The Cosmic Cube, which is a device in Stan Lee's 1960's Captain America revival, holds the key to his power.The movie places all it's elements together at a fast pace. We even get to see Bucky, Cap's partner. Although in this version he doesn't have the costume.  The Howling Commandos make their appearance.  Sans Nick Fury in this movie, because he's alive in the 21st  Century.  Neal  McDonough has a few moments as the ever popular ""Dum, Dum Doogan, Fury's burly and  mustached right hand man. If you're a fan of the comics; you are in for a special treat.That's the advantage of Marvel producing this film. I would have to say out of all the super hero movies this summer, this is the best of them all. You won't be disappointed if you're a die hard fan like myself.  The directors commentary provides lots of unknown information on how the film was made. You get to hear the director, Joe Johnston  talk about how the movie was developed from the ground up.  This has to be the most plausible version of the character I have seen.There were four attempts to bring the Captain to the screen. In the 1940's there was a mediocre movie serial, that didn't follow the  Captain's mythology. In 1979 there were two TV movies with actor Reb Brown. That version brought him into modern times. However the script was very slow to develop.  The 1990 feature film starred Matt Salinger  son of the famous author) as Captain America.  It also featured Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox in supporting roles.  That too was also painfully slow to watch.  What the current producers see was the fact that fans want to see action on the screen.

Stanley Tucci is Dr. Erskine, who chooses Steve to become the first of a new breed of super soldier that will give the Allies an advantage in the war, especially against the Nazi division called HYDRA. He ends up serving as a mentor to Steve, and is also quite funny. Tommy Lee Jones is great as Colonel Phillips, proving a lot of dry wit. Haley Atwell is Agent Peggy Carter, and sometimes characters like her frustrate me, as if they're only there to make a feministic statement. Fortunately that is completely averted, and while the Carter/Rogers romance is nothing to write home about, Atwell and Evans handle the characters well and they get many fun scenes. Dominic Cooper is Howard Stark, and his swaggering performance just screams ""Iron Man's dad!""I kept expecting Hugo Weaving's Johann Shmidt (otherwise called the Red Skull), the head of HYRDA, to erupt into campiness and explode at Toby Jone's Arnim Zola. After all, Dr. Zola isn't exactly comfortable with Shmidt breaking away from Hitler and having HYRDA go rogue, and he's had some failures too. But instead, they both have very interesting interaction and the characters are well played.There's something to be said about The First Avenger's wartime atmosphere. You get the distinct feeling that you're in the proto-Marvel universe. This is what started it all, Cap is chronologically Marvel's first hero. And not just any hero, but a symbol, an icon, not a mystery man. Kids in the Marvel world grow up reading about a very real super soldier who saved the world.The action is great and you can see everything that's going on (unlike a certain other superhero movie about a certain Norse god...). And don't worry, all the cool shield throws and Cap stuff you would expect are present.Okay, so what I do I not like? Well, for one, Sebastian Stan as Steve's best friend, Buck Barnes, gets really shortchanged and I think they should've done more with him.But other than that, I think there's one central problem that leads to a lot of other problems. And here it is: By film's end, I still felt like Steve Rogers was still that Brooklyn kid who just became a hero. I don't think this is Evans' fault at all. First, the pacing gets messed up. Everything is fine until, right after Steve goes on his very first adventure as Captain America, the movie jumps into a montage. Suddenly Cap is leading the Howling Commandos and destroying HYDRA war factories. I wanted to see more of his training, more of the camaraderie of him and the Commandos. As if that weren't enough, we don't really know how the heroes are taking down these factories, we just see them fighting. That way, HYDRA is very unthreatening, and I never believed for a second that they could take over the world. You could say that Cap's WWII career doesn't feel storied enough. I would have liked multiple clashes with the Red Skull, (and that way there would have been way more Hugo Weaving). He should not have been a looming big bad, but a true, diabolical nemesis.Finally I must talk of Cap's finest hour. Ya know, he gets frozen. It's done alright, but it's also in the shadow of what the TV series The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes has done. In EMH, Bucky and Cap have prevented the Red Skull from using the power of the other Realms and winning war. The Skull is going to get away in a rocket, so Cap tells Bucky to stay behind and resolves to defeat the Skull once and for all. The rocket takes off, with Cap climbing the outside ladder, only for him to find that Bucky has followed him. Then Red Skull ejects using his 'jet seat', safely getting away and revealing that the rocket is going to explode. Bucky can't jump off because his foot is snagged on a broken part of the ladder, but when Cap attempts to save him, Bucky just kicks him off to save HIM. Cap falls into the water, about to be frozen for the next seventy years, while Bucky dies in the explosion. In The First Avenger, Cap is alone, and it's less...dramatic. Still, it's good, and I won't spoil what the last thing he says is.I have some frustrations, but I still think that Captain America: The First Avenger is a great movie. It's got it all; the tone, the themes, the characters, the acting, the action. Next to the first Iron-Man, this is arguably the Marvel cinematic universe's best movie so far.8 out of 10",4,"Okay, can I see The Avengers now?",1314230400,"08 25, 2011",2011,4999,"[""'ve"", 'never',

First off i am not going to tell you the story if you want to know that go to wiki or marvel, but to put it plainly the story behind this movie is very good, and has many, many references to the comics both to Captain America, as well as other heroes. Bucky, and the howling commandos are all here and his main foes The Red skull and Arnum Zola are very well acted and brought to life on screen. While i did not like the way Captain America, and Red skull fight ended at the end. I think it was appropriate to set the stage for his return. Tommy Lee Jones does an incredible job as Colonel Philips, and Peggy Carter is brought to life very well by Hayley Atwell. Hugo Weaving's Portrayal of Red Skull is spectacular, but the one who steals the screen is Chris Evans, many including me were concerned he could not go from the playboy of Johnny Storm in the Fantastic Four movies, to the hero we know in Captain America, i now can say i was wrong and he did incredible. The features on the DVD are kinda slim but i have heard there are more on the Blu-ray edition. The one most will want to see is the Avengers Assemble section which details how the avengers get together and most of the links that brought them together from the previous movies, other than that there is commentary by Joe Johnson, as well as outfitting the hero which discuss how the suit and shield and the costumes were made.also on the disc are trailers for the sega game, Avengers:Earth Mightiest Heroes tv show, Transformers:DOFM, and Super 8.

1462662,A1F93NA8HQ47IU,B005IZLPKQ,"Reconnecting To My Childhood ""Time Won't Let ...","[3, 5]","This is the best comic book movie to be released this summer. That is what it is, a comic book movie. It does not surpass that level but nobody ever said it had to. While not a Spider-man 2 or Dark Knight it fits in well as a first entry in an inevitable series. Perhaps not the fun, turn the formula on its head, film that Iron Man was, it is still an excellent comic book film that manages to have developed characters and a story actually propelled by plot rather than CG sequences (I'm looking at you Transformers 2 and 3). Still, even with all its positive attributes the film might've been largely a one time viewing for me, that is, if it hadn't been for Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter.My personal, and largest, issue with comic book movies has been their seeming inability to cast memorable and talented women in the leading lady spot. While the leading lady role has frequently been nothing more than a damsel in distress (other than perhaps in team up movies such as X-men), something unfortunately true even of Nolan's gritty Dark Knight films, here we find that is not the case. Peggy Carter is a female character who stands out amongst the many comic book movie female characters. She is strong willed, independent, can handle herself, never asks for help, doesn't take any crap and does it all in a period where women were undeniably treated as less than men. She does all these things yet she can still walk into a bar in the middle of the film wearing a red dress that leaves everyone at a loss for words.Even better than Peggy Carter's character, and the reason I named the actress rather than the character in my review title, was the casting of Hayley Atwell in the role. The character could have become something much different without a capable actress to play the balance of tough yet feminine. Worse it could have been filled by some less capable big name actress for box office draw. For years in comic book movies I have either dreaded or at best barely stomached the casting of female leading roles.Kirsten Dunst had her moments in the Spidey films but then would come the time when she had to be kidnapped and scream and holler for help, she also always needed a man in her life, if not Peter then another stand in to take his place. Batman Begins casting of Katie Holmes always seemed strange to me, why in a film full of lower status but credible actors would Nolan cast a more household name with much less credibility? Whatever the reason, she played the part but it is not the role anyone remembers from that film. The same goes for the sequel, in which I had high hopes Maggie Gyllenhaal would make welcome changes to the previously pitchy character, unfortunately I dare say that Rachel Dawes only became more helpless and became the one negative to be found in The Dark Knight.More recently I was disappointed to find Gwenyth and Natalie both playing supposed strong women but one (Pepper Potts) who is subordinate to a man who treats her badly and still needs to be saved in the end and the other (Jane Foster) fairly shallow and school girlish overall.While Jane only likes Thor at first because of his muscles, Peggy meets Steve Rogers/The Cap when he is a ninety pound weakling. We see her first tinge of interest in him when he is still this small, all based on his philosophies on fighting and dating. It is this established connection before he becomes a perfect male specimen that cements the story and keeps us truly engaged. Peggy and Steve truly bring out the best in eachother and actually share a common bond of struggling to break free from their respective stereotypes that allows the audience to believe in their relationship, one that is actually formed out of friendship first. The film is great and a wonderful starting point for a series, the ending is unique if only a plot device required for the Avengers tie in and I truly can't wait to see where they take Captain America in his sequel. He has by the end of the film, especially thanks to Peggy Carter, become quite a different hero with quite a different chip on his shoulders than any we have yet to see.So I have wondered why comic book movies don't cast relatively unknown actresses to play these parts and allow them to really create a character. Finally Captain America has done just that with the lovely Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter and I hope we see much more of it in future comic book films. The saddest part of Captain America and perhaps the thing that compells me to want to see it again Repeated times is that based on the ending it is very unlikely we will see the fantastic Peggy Carter/Hayley Atwell in all her glory in any of the sequels. They have some big shoes to fill when they inevitably try to create a Sharon Carter character, let's hope they take cues from however it was that they came to choose Hayley.**By the way, I would like it if Hayley or someone like her played Wonder Woman for DC, brits are already playing supes and batman might as well fill in the big three with a third, and let's not only have a more obscure actress with talent but one who can fill out the costume properly, no stick thing actresses such as when people were rallying for Megan Fox to play WW.",5,Two Words: Hayley Atwell,1320537600,"11 6,

Steve Rogers, a 98 lb weakling, who is transformed into the Captain America character, is among the more human of the Marvel Comic Book characters...he has super-human strengths in all areas...but he can be injured...just like us. I like that aspect of the story. I have not read how they transition Chris Evans, from the short, asthmatic Steve Rogers to the muscle bound Captain America, after being injected w/the &#34;super-soldier serum&#34;; but I'm sure it must have been done w/CGI. The CGI special effects - aside from the transition of Steve Rogers - is stunning...seen it before in other movies, but I never cease to be amazed with the special effects of today's movies. Something else I really liked about this story is that it's set during WW II in the 40s and Captain America is a captain in the American Army fighting the Nazi bad guys in Germany...much more patriotic than most Hollywood films, reminescent of the patriotism on display in movies filmed during the War. In addition to Chris Evans, look for Hugo Weaving, who delivers an outstanding performance as the evil Nazi genius, Johann Schmidt, or &#34;Red Skull&#34;. He has also received the &#34;super soldier serum&#34; but it affects him in different ways...which you'll see as the film develops. Stanley Tucci plays Dr Abraham Erskine, a German expatriot scientist, who developed the &#34;soldier serum&#34;. Captain America's love interest and British soldier is Peggy Carter, played superbly by Hayley Atwell. Tommy Lee Jones is Col Chester Phillips, Captain America's field commander. Also look for Toby Jones as the vice-villain, Dr Zola; and Dominic Cooper as Howard Stark, an inventor who is responsible for Captain America's uniform and equipment.

1462671,A2EW96AE53PZMK,B005IZLPKQ,Richard De Angelis,"[1, 2]","Captain America: The First Avenger could not have possibly been more pro-American--in the best sense of the term. More than just being set during World War II, the film captures the same patriotic spirit of war movies that were actually made then. And it could not possibly show greater respect for the character whose story it tells. In some ways, it seemed less like a superhero movie than a History Channel bio pic or Ken Burns documentary about one of our nation's greatest champions of freedom.The primary source of the good will this movie generates for the U.S.A. is actor Chris Evans' portrayal of Steve Rogers, the man behind the mask of Captain America. Evans' performance had the exact combination of earnestness, determination, humility, guilelessness and unfaltering commitment to serving the greater good that I consider the defining traits of the character. It's these attributes, and not the superheroic persona and outfit he eventually adopts, that make him a perfect embodiment of how Americans, and the rest of the world, once saw this country.  As Evans said in an interview, ""The movie is about values, morals, and someone standing up for the right thing. It's about someone fighting for justice who puts himself last and compassion first."" Once Steve Rogers is transformed from 98-lb. weakling to super-soldier by Dr. Abraham Erskine (wonderfully played by Stanley Tucci), as Captain America he uses his military might less like the world's policeman than its big brother, coming to the rescue when other nations are getting pushed around by Bully States. And like a good neighbor, he never butts in where he isn't invited or overstays his welcome.As I see it, Captain America: The First Avenger is nothing short of a nostalgic love letter to our country: not so much the way it is, or even the way it was, as much as the way we've always wanted it to be. It celebrates everything good about America--from its desire to spread democracy to its scientific innovation--but ignores everything bad, like the racial segregation of the military or internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II (even though it includes African-American Gabe Jones (Derek Luke) and Japanese-American Jim Morita (Kenneth Choi) among the Howling Commandos who join Captain America in his wartime escapades). But given the nature of this film, I don't fault it for praising America's achievements so highly, or for ignoring our misdeeds during WWII. Ironically (and unexpectedly), my only major criticism of the movie is that it ignores the misdeeds of our enemy.Captain America is defined as much by what he stands against as what he stands for. Joe Simon and Jack Kirby created him more than 70 years ago in response to the specific circumstances of their times. There's a reason they chose Adolf Hitler to be on the receiving end of their character's first blow for democracy on the 1941 cover of Captain America #1 (I was thrilled to see thisiconic covercleverly incorporated into the movie). The Third Reich and Nazi Party carried out evils unlike any the world had ever seen. As Jews, Simon and Kirby would have a very personal stake in showing Captain America symbolically destroy Hitler's forces in the pages of a comic book that at its height was selling a million copies a month. It would be inconceivable to make a movie about Captain America's earliest adventures, or any movie about World War II for that matter, without the Nazi's playing a prominent part. And yet, director Joe Johnston pulled it off--for reasons I can't begin to understand.The evil empire Johnston pits Captain America against is Hydra, a fictional terrorist network in the Marvel Comics universe. This is no doubt to set the organization up as a recurring adversary in future Marvel Studios films.  Here it's described as a Nazi research group that combined occult powers and advanced technology to create wonder weapons for Hitler's stormtroopers. What I found disturbing was that the Nazi part of the organization was downplayed to the point of virtual invisibility. Although Hydra's tentacled skull symbol got about as much screen time as the stars and stripes, I don't recall ever seeing a swastika (although I'm sure the few that must have appeared in the movie just went by so fast I missed them*). I might understand, at least theoretically, choosing to minimize references to Germany out of a sensitivity to present-day Germans (although, as Dr. Erskine points out in the film, ""the first country the Nazi's invaded was their own""). But whose feelings could the filmmakers have been trying to spare by taking Nazis out of the picture? Even more incredible than the lack of swastikas in the movie, was the total absence of any mention of the Holocaust (as far as I can remember, it wasn't even hinted at). Besides being a seemingly misguided attempt to sanitize history, it also diminishes the importance of Captain America's conflict with the film's main villain.Hydra's leader is the Red Skull (played menacingly by Hugo Weaving), a character who debuted in the same 1941 comic book as Captain America and has been the arch nemesis of the ""Sentinel of Liberty"" ever since. The Red Skull is the living embodiment of everything Hitler and Nazi Germany stood for--Aryan superiority, racism, antisemitism, homophobia and blind obedience to the State to name a few. The Third Reich personified, he excels at and revels in the practical application of Nazi theory--unprovoked military aggression, torture, political repression and mass murder. But in the movie, the Red Skull abandons Nazism for a more vague, generic super villain desire to rule the world. The problem I have with this is that he never explains why this is his goal, or how a world under his control would differ from the one he's already living in. To put it in actor terms, I don't understand his motivation. It's clear that he is cruel and arrogant, which makes him Steve Roger's opposite in terms of his basic character. But in comic books, the Red Skull was created to be Captain America's opposite.Based on their depiction of Steve Rogers' pre-Captain America training, screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely were obviously influenced byThe Adventures of Captain America: Sentinel of Liberty,  a 1991 four-part miniseries by storytellers Fabian Nicieza and Kevin Maguire, retelling Cap's origin in commemoration of the character's 50th anniversary. Unfortunately, I get the impression Markus and McFeely never read the last book in the series, where a captured Captain America is taken to the heart of Nazi Germany and forced into an arena to battle the Red Skull in ritual combat before Adolf Hitler and an audience of Wehrmacht soldiers, Gestapo officers, and concentration camp prisoners (who were so conspicuously absent from the film). Of course, this intended demonstration of Aryan superiority does not turn out as Hitler had hoped. Now that's something I would have loved to have seen on the big screen.By removing any trace of Nazi philosophy from the Red Skull in this film, his final battle with Captain America becomes nothing more than two comic book characters slugging it out. Instead, it should have been an allegorical clash of ideologies: totalitarianism, intolerance and brutality versus freedom, acceptance and compassion. This is not just a war over territory but an epic war of wills that has been waged since the dawn of civilization--the Will to Power versus the Will of the People. For me, the failure to make clear the moral high ground in this fight kept a merely good movie from being truly great.* A case in point: In a movie poster for the film that recreated the cover ofCaptain America #1, the swastika band that was originally on Hitler's right arm was moved to his left, thereby hiding the Nazi symbol from view.",4,Fighting the good fight,1372377600,"06 28,

In the 1940s, headstrong Steve Rogers (Evans) volunteers for a top secret government experiment that transforms him from a scrawny weakling into the Super Soldier known as Captain America. Captain America leads the fight for freedom against the evil HYDRA organization and their leader Red Skull (Hugo Weaving) who has discovered an otherworldly power that will ensure him world domination. Captain America: The First Avenger is the latest comic book adaptation to hit the big screen, and is certainly a playful action-packed romp. Though not a comic book masterpiece, it does succeed in capturing the spirit of what a comic book movie should be. Director Joe Johnston has created a stylish old-fashioned adventure picture with some solid elements of drama, humor and action. The cast also includes Tommy Lee Jones, Hayley Atwell, Sebastian Stan, Dominic Cooper, Neal McDonough, Derek Luke, Toby Jones and Stanley Tucci.If you're a fan of comic book heroes or good old-fashioned adventure, then Captain America: The First Avenger is a highly recommended addition to your Blu-Ray collection. The comic book blockbuster is presented in a 2.35:1 widescreen format. Though not the sharpest transfer of any Paramount releases, the movie still looks fantastic with fine detail and vivid colors. The 7.1 DTS-HD MA soundtrack delivers fine clarity, well balanced surround effects and good bass. The Blu-Ray features a nice variety of extras: audio commentary track with director Joe Johnston and production crew, five minutes of deleted scenes, theatrical trailers, the short film A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer, and six behind-the-scenes and in-depth comic book featurettes.

1462681,AHBNPMHDWZ7SB,B005IZLPKQ,RJ Smoove,"[3, 4]","After years of awaiting a movie worth this historically rich character's name, I'm happy to announce that a good Captain America film finally here. I was quite blown away by how much I enjoyed it. My fear of the worst kept my expectations in check as I waited for The First Avenger to hit theaters. For a while, I expected it to be mediocre to moderately good, but I retained a cautious optimism. I didn't have enough faith in it to hype the movie up to friends and family, but I prayed it would be as good as the previous films in the Avengers Saga. Being a huge Marvel fan, I was obliged to see it no matter how good or bad critics said it was. Surprisingly, it turned out to be just what Joe Johnston's credentials promised. It was a good old fashioned throwback action adventure flick that's fun (for the family, despite a few shockingly violent moments), humorous, and surprisingly, emotionally resonant. I thought it was a notch or two above Thor, albeit I wouldn't recommend one over the other. Johnston's last few films (The Wolfman, Jurassic Park III and Hidalgo -- two of which I actually enjoyed) didn't have great receptions, so it was understandable for most to be weary of him directing, but I think he did a damn good job with material that had the potential to be very silly. The character, Captain America, is one of those characters that everyone knows of, but not many people care about. He probably comes across as a boring character, due to his overtly American themes, simplistic superpowers, and his shield.In fact, the film could have easily been quite boring, or laughably silly, but I'm pleased to say that this movie is none of the above, and neither are most of Cap's latest publishings, to be honest. This is a classic case of not judging a book by its cover. Granted, there are inherently cheesy moments throughout the film, but what do you expect from an apparent propaganda piece about an unlikely soldier with an American flag costume and a big shield, who is battling an evil Nazi with red skin that is bent on world domination? I actually loved the cheese factor. It went quite well with the 40's WWII atmosphere, and the film as a whole. Like I mentioned before, this film was a throwback to the old fashioned action adventure movies like Indiana Jones and The Rocketeer (another Johnston film). There's an automatic cheese factor that goes with the territory. Early flags were raised by internet dwellers about Chris Evans not being right for the leading role. I never bought into those complaints. I mean, have you guys seen him? Blonde hair, blue eyes, quirky innocence, toned body, and actual acting abilities (if you've seen him in anything besides Fantastic Four -- which he was actually one of the best aspects of). What the hell else did we need for him to be right for the role? I don't know, but I had faith in him and he delivered. Some people have said that he was bland and just a good guy with no internal conflict, and for the most part, I agree. That's who he is supposed to be though. His character was developed as he grew up, due to him being physically inane. That was the very reason why Dr. Erskine (Stanley Tucci) recruited him.I loved Evans as Steve Rogers, and even more as Cap. He just flat out kicked ass, in my opinion. He went against what we've become accustomed to in superhero movies, and it worked well. Spoilers: When Cap threw a knife into a Hydra agents back, then threw two other Hydra agents right out of a plane, I knew his portrayal would be a legend for years to come. I really was not expecting that kind of brutality in a cartoonish comic book movie where us older fans have come to expect major toning down for young children. I mean, he is a soldier, and this is a war, but you get my point. It would be asinine for him to go through all of that trouble trying to enlist and getting turned down, only to go overseas and just knock his enemies out. Killing is what war is about, so hats off to Johnston and his writers, as well as Marvel Studios and Paramount for having the testicular fortitude to let that happen in The First Avenger. Another surprisingly violent moment was when the older woman in the hidden base got shot and we actually saw the impact. Well, she did have a machine gun, but even so, I applaud them again for letting that happen in a family blockbuster. It added to the seriousness of the situation, and left more of an impact. The audience should take from that, that the Nazi spy who gunned down the older women needed to be taken down as soon as possible. While I did appreciate the mature sparks of violence, there were also other noticeable tone downs that conflicted with them.Now I'll admit that this is just me nitpicking, but that's what reviews are for, right? Similar to the Decepticon canons in Transformers: Dark of the Moon, I have to say that I was distracted by the way that Hydra's advanced weapons disintegrated their victims, pretty much reducing them to dust, instead of actually showing the devastation of the weapons like they did with regular guns. I'm not saying that it was necessary to show blood splatter when the cosmic blasts impacted. I understand the ratings system, but what they chose to do was pushing it, even for science fiction. Speaking of those weapons, some have argued that they seemed more appropriate for a film set in the future, more so than one set in the 1940's. That is an understandable quibble, but that was the point. The cosmic cube allowed Hydra to develop weaponry that was far beyond anything from the time period. That was why Red Skull went through such lengths to attain the cube, and develop the Hydra tech with it. Speaking of Red Skull, I have to say I loved him in this movie. Perhaps he was not as menacing as he could have been, but, I'll be damned if he wasn't one of the coolest villains I've seen in a while. Hugo Weaving should just play villains in everything for the rest of his career. He does it too well. After seeing his performance, I cannot think of another actor who I would have chosen over him. I'm glad to have him immortalized in the Marvel Universe now, and I hope he returns for the sequel. I'm sure he will because he's obviously not dead, only teleported to another dimension or plane. Actually, I think the whole cast was great.Haley Atwell was probably the best main love interest of all the Avengers Saga films, which is surprising given she's the least recognizable of all of the actresses who played them. If I were to rank them, I'd do it as follows: Haley Atwell, Gwyneth Paltrow, Natalie Portman, and lastly, Liv Tyler. As for Atwell's character, Peggy Carter, I loved how they chose to keep her sexiness hidden until she appeared in that stunning red dress. Her character was introduced as a tough one, but she showed compassion towards Steve. She was a very well developed character, and I'll be sorely disappointed if this is the last we see of her. Spoilers: The moment she and Steve shared before he crashed into the ice was moving, and as I was feeling for them, I was quite surprised that this film managed elicit such an emotional response from me. The same film that I feared would be drowned in mediocrity. They did such a fantastic job at developing thirt relationship. Sadly, I'm pretty sure this is her only outing. There were quite a few moments when I sincerely cared for the fate of the characters. Not only Steve and Peggy, but Bucky (Sebastian Stan) as well. He has one of the saddest, and most surprising moments in the film. Even as a fan of the comics, who knew what would happen to Bucky, as well as who he later becomes, I have to admit that moment got me. I mentioned Stanley Tucci briefly before, but I didn't say that I enjoyed his performance as the doctor responsible for Steve's transformation. I thought Tucci did a pretty good job with the minimal screentime he had.What more can one say about Tommy Lee Jones that hasn't been said before? He was primarily comic relief, and he was quite funny. Dominic Cooper (The Devil's Double, An Education) was an appropriate choice as Howard Stark. He was a nice counterpart to Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark. I was pleased with the Howling Commandos as well. Neal McDonough was great as Dum Dum Doogan. His character wasn't as fleshed out as I would have liked, considering the role he played in S.H.I.E.L.D.'s development, but he was fine nonetheless. Now all of this praise is not to say that I don't think the film is flawed. It's far from perfect, and many people will most likely have issues with the overall cheesiness of the plot and stereotypical portrayals of the characters, but I enjoyed it very much. It was a great tie-in to the Avengers Saga, but nothing took precedence over Cap's origin story. This is first, and foremost, a Captain America film.The build up for The Avengers has been an exciting one to experience. Each link in the chain is solid, with some obviously being stronger than others. I think Captain America: The First Avenger falls in at second best in the series, after the first Iron Man. As for the transfer, the picture quality is as good as one would expect a modern release to look. Detail is strong and fairly crisp, although some may confuse the Director and Cinematographer's choice of dim lighting and color timing as soft. The sound is pretty much flawless. As far as the extras go, they leave a lot to be desired. The best of the bunch is without a doubt, the commentary. The featurettes, as well as the Marvel One-Shot, are short, but sweet.

1462682,A1DPP8TXDCHCDN,B005IZLPKQ,"R. L. Huff ""An old reader""","[0, 1]","Those of us ancient enough to remember the original superhero incarnations always look at these &#34;resurrections&#34; with a jaundiced eye.  Joe Johnston, Kevin Feige, and writers Markus and McFeely put more than a little heart and effort into this one. The result is not only proverbial &#34;action-adventure entertainment&#34; but deepwater exploration into the nature of human good and evil.The premise is that a 4-F with a good heart is transformed by science into the man he ought to be: an ubermensch whose capabilities match his conscience.  Thus armored in soul and body he sallies forth to battle pure evil - the Red Skull of Hydra, who seems ready to outdo Hitler and take over the Evil Empire for himself.  The reconstruction of time, place and culture is superb, especially as contrasted to his end-film resurrection in the 21st century.  The humility of his transition from circus performer to action hero is also poignant, and necessary: a modern audience tends to mock men in tights who wrap themselves in the flag, just as the frontline soldiers who initially reject the CA shtick.  It takes a crisis to make Captain America more than a clown image.That said, there are a few rather absurdist premises in the film.  Blacks or Native Americans of the period might have a problem with a white man in flag-drag symbolizing a force for good throughout the world, when experience at home teaches differently.  The defected German scientist would, in reality, have been as Nazi as the bad one allied with Red Skull, turning a new leaf only through the losing course of war.  And CA's stint as a USO performer would have been unnecessary - the whole operation in &#34;real life&#34; would have been conducted under the OSS, the CIA's predecessor.  There'd have been no qualms about using a natural bully for genetic guinea pig.As a good if old-fashioned gung-ho war film, and a probe into the human psyche, this effort is one of the better recreations of the comic-book genre: not a satire, not self-righteous, and not &#34;dark.&#34;  I haven't yet seen the sequel.

1462688,AJ4TG9LNSB0Y4,B005IZLPKQ,"Robert M. ""Professional Nerd""","[0, 0]","&#8220;Captain America: The First Avenger&#8221; is a great addition to the burgeoning Marvel Cinematic Universe canon, and a great comic book movie, and an awesome action film in general. It certainly atones for the past sins of the Captain, mainly brief and disastrous sojourns in the 70s and one in the 90s. Google it if ye dare!This film, unlike many screen interpretations of Cap which often jump straight to modern-day heroics, was wisely done as a period piece, set in the twilight hours of World War II. We see Steve Rogers before he dons the red, white, and blue, and therefore become much more invested in his character before he was a Super Soldier. Great performances are to be had all around. Chris Evans gets Steve&#8217;s humility and all-around good guy charm. The ideals and attitude shown here prove that this was the Greatest Generation. Hayley Atwell does fine as Cap&#8217;s interest Peggy Carter, and here she&#8217;s in the army as well, putting her in the action instead of the girlfriend back home as she is normally shown, and also oddly British for some reason. Tommy-Lee Jones is as entertaining as one could expect as Army General Tommy-Lee Jones. Yeah, it&#8217;s one of those roles, but in a good way. Likewise, Hugo Weaving is great as German Hugo Weaving. But seriously, Weaving was a great choice for Cap&#8217;s eternal nemesis the villainous Red Skull. As a villain, Red Skull is pretty standard and doesn&#8217;t offer many surprises (even the face reveal was coming a mile away). Toby Jones did good as scientist Arnim Zola, and there was a cool easter egg of his comic appearance. Stanley Tucci shows his acting versatility as Dr. Abraham Erskine. All of the Howling Commandos (sans Nick Fury, contrary to comic tradition) are great too.One of the criticisms of this film is that it is a full-length feature ad for &#8220;The Avengers.&#8221; Well, there definitely was one after the credits, and it is in the title. The McGuffin of the movie exists to set up &#8220;The Avengers&#8221;, but despite all this, I believe it holds up on its own as an origin story of one of Marvel&#8217;s oldest and greatest heroes. The set-up is well paced and the action scenes deliver on the awesomeness, particularly Cap&#8217;s signature shield throwing. There is an unfortunate montage that glazes over much of the battles between the good guys and bad guys, but that&#8217;s really my only major gripe with the film. There is a suspension of disbelief that must be had in the plot, but not to the point where it breaks, and the source material forces much of it.Overall, Captain America delivers as a great superhero film. It is in many ways a set-up for &#8220;The Avengers,&#8221; but it&#8217;s a good set-up that can stand on its own.",5,All those who chose to oppose Captain America's shield must yield!,1396915200,"04 8, 2014",2014,2766,"['8220', 'Captain', 'America', 'First', 'Avenger', '8221', 'great', 'addition', 'burgeoning', 'Marvel', 'Cinematic', 'Universe', 'canon', 'great', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'awesome', 'action', 'film', 'general', 'certainly', 'past', 'sins', 'Captain', 'mainly', 'brief', 'disastrous', 'sojourns', '70s', 'one', '90s', 'Google', 'ye', 'dare', 'film', 'many', 'screen', 'interpretations', 'Cap', 'often', 'jump', 'straight', 'modern-day', 'heroics', 'was', 'wisely', 'done', 'period', 'piece', 'set', 'twilight', 'hours', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'see', 'Steve', 'Rogers', 'red', 'white', 'blue', 'therefore', 'become', 'much', 'more', 'invested', 'character', 'was', 'Super', 'Soldier', 'Great', 'performances', 'are', 'be', 'had', 'around', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'Steve', '8217', 'humility', 'all-around', 'good', 'guy', 'charm', 'ideals', 'attitude', 'shown', 'here', 'prove', 'was', 'Greatest', 'Generation', 'Hayley', 'Atwell', 'fine', 'Cap', '8217', 's', 'interest', 'Peggy', 'Carter', 'here', '8217', 's', 'army', 'as', 'well', 'putting', 'action', 'instead', 'girlfriend', 'back', 'home', 'normally', 'shown', 'also', 'oddly', 'British', 'reason', 'Tommy-Lee', 'Jones', 'as', 'entertaining', 'one', 'could', 'expect', 'Army', 'General', 'Tommy-Lee', 'Jones', 'Yeah', '8217', 'one', 'roles', 'good', 'way', 'Likewise', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'great', 'German', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'seriously', 'Weaving', 'was', 'great', 'choice', 'Cap', '8217', 'eternal', 'nemesis', 'villainous', 'Red', 'Skull', 'villain', 'Red', 'Skull', 'pretty', 'standard', 'doesn', '8217', 'offer', 'many', 'surprises', 'even', 'face', 'reveal', 'was', 'coming', 'mile', 'away', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'did', 'good', 'scientist', 'Arnim', 'Zola', 'there', 'was', 'cool', 'easter', 'egg', 'comic', 'appearance', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'acting', 'versatility', 'Dr.', 'Abraham', 'Erskine', 'Howling', 'Commandos', 'sans', 'Nick', 'Fury', 'contrary', 'comic', 'tradition', 'are', 'great', 'too.One', 'criticisms', 'film', 'full-length', 'feature', 'ad', '8220', 'Avengers.', '8221', 'Well', 'definitely', 'was', 'one', 'credits', 'title', 'McGuffin', 'movie', 'set', 'up', '8220', 'Avengers', '8221', 'believe', 'up', 'own', 'origin', 'story', 'one', 'Marvel', '8217', 'oldest', 'greatest', 'heroes', 'set-up', 'well', 'paced', 'action', 'deliver', 'awesomeness', 'particularly', 'Cap', '8217', 's', 'signature', 'shield', 'throwing', 'unfortunate', 'montage', 'much', 'battles', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', '8217', 'really', 'only', 'major', 'gripe', 'film', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'must', 'be', 'had', 'plot', 'not', 'point', 'where', 'source', 'material', 'forces', 'much', 'it.Overall', 'Captain', 'America', 'delivers', 'great', 'superhero', 'film', 'many', 'ways', 'set-up', '8220', 'Avengers', '8221', '8217', 's', 'good', 'set-up', 'can', 'stand', 'own']",N/A
1462689,A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8,B005IZLPKQ,Roger J. Buffington,"[9, 14]","I wanted to like ""Captain America"" but the movie's faults made this a one-off--good enough to watch once, but probably not one of those that the viewer will watch over and over again over the years.  The characters had potential but did not live up to this potential.  Steve Rogers and Peggy Clark have a chaste little attraction going, but it never matures into anything of note in the film.  Steve Rogers himself lacks depth, and the film could have developed him, and his friend ""Bucky"" much more.

1462690,AOFC8T8U7WUGV,B005IZLPKQ,Roland,"[0, 0]","Captain America (created by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby) has long been one of my favorite superheroes. As a matter of fact, I would go as far as to put him up there with the ""Big Three"": Superman, Batman and Spider-Man. So, needless to say, I was quite stoked when 2011's ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" was first announced.Still shots released in March of 2011 in ""USA Today"" only further whetted my appetite to see this movie. Even before the still were released, the news that actor Chris Evans had signed to play the lead role had me excited about this movie; Having seen Evans in ""Cellular"" and the two ""Fantastic Four"" films, I have always believed he was ""the right role"" away from being an A-list actor in Hollywood. ""Captain"", and this year's ""Avengers"", have brought him (in my opinion) even closer to the aforementioned status.Evans is surrounded with an exceptional cast. The lovely Hayley Atwell is Peggy Carter, Cap's superior office and love interest. Academy Award winner, Tommy Lee Jones is Col. Chester Phillips (Cap's CO). Sebastian Stan and Dominic Cooper play Bucky Barnes (Cap's best friend) and Howard Stark (Iron Man's dad), respectively.Stanley Tucci (Dr. Abraham Erskine), Samuel L. Jackson (Sgt. Nick Fury) and Hugo Weaving, as the film's villian: Nazi Red Skull, round out this exceptional cast.The film is set in the midst of World War II. The Nazis have a secret organization, HYDRA, that collects and analyzes mystic artifacts in order to use them as weapons against the Allied Forces. A glowing blue, cubed object, known as the Tesseract (and, as we know from the other Avenger movies, was once owned by the god Odin) is Red Skull's mission: to harness and control the unimaginable power of it for the Nazis.Captain America's mission is to stop him.But, let's not get ahead of ourselves. Captain America is Steve Rogers. A young man from Brooklyn who wants more than anything to join the Army and fight the nazi menace. But he is too frail to join: he attempts to several times but keeps getting the dreaded 4-F (unfit for combat).However, what he lacks in size, he more than makes up for in heart, courage and intelligence. This is recognized by Dr. Abraham Erskine, creator of the super soldier serum, who handpicks Rogers as the soldier to receive it. Dr. Erskine gets Cap, er, Rogers admitted into the Army and after Rogers shows his bravery and intelligence, he receives the serum.Unfortunately, a nazi intelligence officer manages to kill Dr. Erskine and destroy the serum, so Captain America is destined to be the only recipient of it. With this powerful soldier under their command, the US Army decides to keep him off the battlefields and use him instead to raise money at home for the war effort.Cap finally gets a break. While overseas, ""entertaining"" the troops (they aren't buying: ""bring back the girls!""), Cap sneaks away with a regiment and safely brings back a captured United States squad.Now, with the powers that be, and the US soldiers firmly behind him, Cap leads successful assault after assault, all throughout Europe, on the Nazis...leading to a dramatic confrontation with the Red Skull for control of the Tesseract.I will not reveal what happens in Cap's confrontation with the Red Skull...but I will say this: The movie ends with Captain America standing in the midst of Times Square, in present day (2011) America. Sgt. Nick Fury shows up to explain just how he got here.Furthermore, I'll say this...the beginning of the movie also gives away the fact that Cap is going to be transported from the 1940's into present-day America...even the movie's trailers show Cap in Times Square talking to Nick Fury.This is my main concern with this film. It is quite entertaining, but because you know Cap is going to wind up in the present day, it is a bit deflating. Cap has a blossoming romance going with Peggy Carter, but you know it isn't meant to be...unless somehow she also ends up in present day America for 2014's scheduled, ""Captain America 2"".The movie's other problem is that its ending is rushed, which is a shame because the movie's pace builds very well (they particularly do a great job of pacing with Cap's origin story) but then, boom!--The movie's over. Due to this, I have to rate the movie at 3.5 stars, and I'll round to four for my official rating. If this had been a ""stand-alone"" movie with a better ending (and not just a vehicle for Marvel to introduce Captain America's character for this year's mega-blockbuster, ""The Avengers""), I think its score might have been somewhere along the lines of 9 out of 10.At least, thankfully, the movie does keep Captain America true to his roots: God and country; and VERY patriotic...and does so in a way that does not come off as ""cheesy"".  Because of this (and because of an exceptional performance from an equally exceptional cast), in spite of the movie's one glaring flaw, it still can be termed a success. And, worth a look.A few more notes:The visuals in this movie are stunning. The streets of Brooklyn have a grainy, ""browned page,"" pulp-ish look to them. Also, early on in the movie, Steve (pre-Cap) and Bucky, along with their dates, visit the World's Fair and it looks nothing short of beautiful as it smoothly melds together a futuristic and 1940's look. On the big screen, I thought the firework filled sky at the World's Fair looked nothing short of breathtaking.The scenes of Captain America in action in Europe are nothing short of spectacular, too. Cap, in his powder-blue suit--which blends so well into the snowy fields and woods used for battle backgrounds--looks very, very sharp. In particular, there is a scene where Cap and his men rappel onto the top of a speeding Nazi train (again, with the same snowy background) that only the big screen can do justice to.Kudos to Director Joe Johnston, a George Lucas protege, for doing an outstanding job with the look and feel of this movie...I only imagine what he could have done if the material given to him hadn't been limited...Thank you for reading.Blu-Ray Special FeaturesDisc One includes the Blu-Ray disc; a short with the ""Avengers' "" Clark Gregg (very funny in this as well) entitled, ""A Funny Thing Happened

But Steve is a scrawny 95 pound young man with asthma and a weak heart. But a doctor sees Steve's eagerness and determination and decides to give him a chance in a special experimental division of the army. There, Steve proves himself worthy and brave enough to be the first test subject for a super-soldier serum. Meanwhile, a Nazi scientific faction called Hydra has found a remarkable substance that just may change the course of the war.With extraordinary special effects and CGI, Chris Evans begins the film as a small, weak man. His transformation to Captain America is worth the price of admission alone. Evans completely embodies both Steve Rogers - the brave but bullied weakling to the strong super-soldier. Tommy Lee Jones plays Captain America's commanding officer to scene-stealing perfection. And supporting roles by Hayley Atwell (Agent Carter), Sebastian Stan (`Bucky' Barnes), Dominic Cooper (Howard Stark), and Stanley Tucci (Dr. Erskine) added humor and heart to the film. Hugo Weaving was chilling and brilliance as Johann Schmidt, the evil mastermind behind Hydra.The story takes place almost completely in 1942, with beautiful settings and Stark-infused technology and fun gadgets. With plenty of action, adventure, suspense, and laughs - fans of all ages will enjoy this fantastic re-imaging of an iconic super hero. It would have been easy to make this a simple action/adventure film, but the writers did an amazing job of infusing drama, patriotism, and light-hearted humor to balance the story.

1462718,A1C58YXM2A30CY,B005IZLPKQ,"Scotman's Film & Book Reviews ""Film & Book Re...","[2, 4]","I really enjoyed the Captain America film.  I've read most of the Kirby-inspired comics and his adventures in the modern times, but the film takes place when Captain America was first scripted, during the days of World War II.In the 1940s comic book companies wrote plenty of patriotic stories and encouraged their readers to buy war bonds and even to (sadly) donate their comics collections and have them pulped for the war effort (painful to type that).Story & Plot:Great themes in this story.  A man who was born weak and asthmatic whose best friend is going off to war.  Steve Rogers wants to go along but has been 4-F'd several times.  A casual conversation with Rogers and gang is overheard by a professor Abraham who encourages Rogers to be the guinea pig in an experiment that would create super soldiers.Meanwhile another man, ostensibly fighting for the Nazi's, has his own plans.  He too has been subjected to an earlier form of the super soldier serum.  But Schultz, now super-sized, becomes the Red Skull and his minions of Hydra wish nothing less than world conquest.The clash between the Red Skull and Captain America is palpable with emotion.  The good guy gets his lumps; the bad guy retreats in defeat.War!Several scenes were memorable:  The experiment that made a skinny runt into a tall, handsome super-soldier is relegated to selling war bonds and basically being made fun of.  He's made into a symbol by Madison Avenue.  They even make comic books out of him - such irony.  The silly costume and the dancing girls are the icing on the cake.We have a version of the Howling Commandoes here as they are led by a new Captain America and he gives the Red Skull a bloody nose in several battles - the Captain with his shield and the Red Skull with his new laser weapons, powered by a technology that may have come from ""the treasure room of Odin.""Bottom Line:  I've read some reviews of fans who were disappointed, but they just don't get that this is an adaptation of the comics - that it must be altered for those who have never heard of Captain America and are unfamiliar with his story.  The World War II angle with the Nazi's was necessary as that's when the Captain was first formed.And who would not want to see a few Nazi's burned, huh?A combination of an Indiana Jones-type thriller and the sensibility of Sky Captain & The World of Tomorrow, a must-watch for comics fans and friends of fantasy.",5,First Rate Film for the First Avenger!,1311638400,"07 26, 2011",2011,2421,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'Captain', 'America', 'film', ""'ve"", 'read', 'most', 'Kirby-inspired', 'comics', 'adventures', 'modern', 'times', 'film', 'place', 'when', 'Captain', 'America', 'was', 'first', 'scripted', 'days', 'World', 'War', 'II.In', '1940s', 'comic', 'book', 'companies', 'wrote', 'plenty', 'patriotic', 'stories', 'encouraged', 'readers', 'buy', 'war', 'bonds', 'even', 'sadly', 'donate', 'comics', 'collections', 'have', 'pulped', 'war', 'effort', 'painful', 'type', '.Story', 'Plot', 'Great', 'themes', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'born', 'weak', 'asthmatic', 'best', 'friend', 'going', 'off', 'war', 'Steve', 'Rogers', 'go', 'along', 'been', '4-F', ""'d"", 'several', 'times', 'casual', 'conversation', 'Rogers', 'gang', 'overheard', 'professor', 'Abraham', 'who', 'Rogers', 'be', 'guinea', 'pig', 'experiment', 'would', 'create', 'super', 'soldiers.Meanwhile', 'man', 'ostensibly', 'fighting', 'Nazi', 'own', 'plans', 'too', 'been', 'subjected', 'earlier', 'form', 'super', 'soldier', 'serum', 'Schultz', 'now', 'super-sized', 'Red', 'Skull', 'minions', 'Hydra', 'wish', 'nothing', 'less', 'world', 'conquest.The', 'clash', 'Red', 'Skull', 'Captain', 'America', 'palpable', 'emotion', 'good', 'guy', 'lumps', 'bad', 'guy', 'retreats', 'defeat.War', 'Several', 'scenes', 'were', 'memorable', 'experiment', 'made', 'skinny', 'runt', 'tall', 'handsome', 'super-soldier', 'relegated', 'selling', 'war', 'bonds', 'basically', 'being', 'made', 'fun', 'made', 'symbol', 'Madison', 'Avenue', 'even', 'make', 'comic', 'books', 'such', 'irony', 'silly', 'costume', 'dancing', 'girls', 'are', 'icing', 'cake.We', 'have', 'version', 'Howling', 'Commandoes', 'here', 'are', 'led', 'new', 'Captain', 'America', 'Red', 'Skull', 'bloody', 'nose', 'several', 'battles', 'Captain', 'shield', 'Red', 'Skull', 'new', 'laser', 'weapons', 'powered', 'technology', 'may', 'have', 'come', 'treasure', 'room', 'Odin', 'Bottom', 'Line', ""'ve"", 'read', 'reviews', 'fans', 'who', 'were', 'disappointed', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'adaptation', 'comics', 'must', 'be', 'altered', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'Captain', 'America', 'are', 'unfamiliar', 'story', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'angle', 'Nazi', 'was', 'necessary', 'when', 'Captain', 'was', 'first', 'formed.And', 'who', 'would', 'not', 'want', 'see', 'few', 'Nazi', 'burned', 'huh', 'combination', 'Indiana', 'Jones-type', 'thriller', 'sensibility', 'Sky', 'Captain', 'World', 'Tomorrow', 'must-watch', 'comics', 'fans', 'friends', 'fantasy']",N/A
1462719,AJ7SBFCIXPJM1,B005IZLPKQ,"Scot Merideth Peirson ""Scot Peirson""","[0, 0]","Marvel Films had been working toward late April/early May of 2012--and ""Marvel's The Avengers""--since 2003, when the studio did the Ang Lee version of ""Hulk"".  The Eric Bana-led story was a fail, but the second swing in 2008--""The Incredible Hulk"" with Edward Norton--was better.  The two ""Iron Man"" movies have been brilliantly driven by Robert Downey Jr.'s take on Tony Stark, and ""Thor""--released in the spring of 2011--introduced Chris Hemsworth as the imperious Asgardian Thunder God.But setting up for the Avengers couldn't be done without introducing Steve Rogers.  Hence, we had the last prequel to ""The Avengers"" appear in July of 2011.To me, it seemed as if Marvel Films and Paramount Studios took an interesting risk in casting Chris Evans to play Steve Rogers.  Evans, to me, seemed dicey here because he had already had a little history in the Marvel Films' Universe--playing Johnny Storm/The Human Torch in the two Fantastic Four films--and also because he seemed to specialize in the smart-alecky slacker type (Jensen in ""The Losers"", Ryan in ""Cellular"" in addition to Johnny Storm).As it turned out...I shouldn't have worried.  Evans--in what is essentially the origin story of Captain America--brought the severity and the responsibility of Steve Rogers to the fore, along with a naivete in the first 30 to 45 minutes of the movie, when Rogers is the 100-pound physical weakling who is all heart and courage (The CGI that pares Evans down and attaches Evans' head to that small body is a sight to behold).  Once Rogers gets the Super-Soldier serum/Vita-Rays treatment...well, YOU KNOW.The movie, to a certain extent, plays like a an old Saturday-afternoon serial.  We meet the bad guy--Johann Schmidt and his science/magic related wing of the German Military during WWII, which allows for the introduction of the long-time antagonist group of the Marvel Universe--HYDRA--to be introduced.  Of course, Schmidt has a case of acne gone really bad--having been introduced to the same Super-Soldier formula that turned Rogers into Cap and amplified Rogers' strengths, Schmidt's viciousness and cruelty ends up being amplified in turning him into The Red Skull.  It's a great performance by Hugo Weaving in the introduction of Cap's greatest foe, and the prosthetics are dead on.This movie also allowed for a fuller fleshing out of the legend of Bucky Barnes.  Rather than go for the ""Batman/Robin"" dynamic, Sebastian Stan played James Buchannan Barnes as a young adult; the protector for Steve Rogers pre-formula.  Plus, the introduction of the Howlin' Commandos--sans Nick Fury--was nice.  Neal McDonough gave a solid turn as ""Dum-Dum"" Dugan, and Kenneth Choi's Jim Morita was good.The supporting players were solid, overall.  Hayley Atwell's Peggy Carter believes in Steve's heroism.  Stanley Tucci's Abraham Erskine believes in Steve's heart and sense of right.  Dominic Cooper's Howard Stark seems a slightly less manic version of RDJ's Tony.  Tommy Lee Jones...well, he's Tommy Lee Jones, no matter what the role at this point in his career.  In this case, as Colonel Chester Phillips, he is the last to see that Rogers can be the brave and heroic leader of men.  Once he does see it, he embraces it wholly.Some have called the ending contrived, a vehicle to bring Captain America forward for ""The Avengers"".  But the end has been part of the Captain America legend for over 45 years.

It was fairly faithful to the origins created in the Marvel Comics, although of course there were some minor changes. Now I am not going to give away any real spoilers, but I will give you a few teasers for you to enjoy and whet your appetite before you go and view this movie for yourself.This movie follows Steve Rogers from the start as he tries to join the military during World War II, but is always being denied due to his small stature and basically weak and frail body, although his spirit is second-to-none as you will see. However during the 1943 World's Fair, he is overheard talking about his desire to join the military and is given a miraculous opportunity which will lead to him being created as Captain America, which is initially merely a glorified ""chorus girl"" as is so aptly put by consummate actor, Tommy Lee Jones, who portrays the Colonel in charge of the super-soldier program. Cap finally gets his chance to fulfill his destiny while performing for the troops on the front lines during a USO show and it is from this point forward that the legend of Captain America as a truly heroic American hero begins.My only minor complaint with this movie was some futuristic weapons that were created during the time-period by Hydra and the Red Skull, but with the cosmic cube playing a pivotal role in the story, I guess I can overlook that particular point.Chris Evans did a superb job as Captain America as well as very good performances by Stanley Tucci and a special nod to Hugo Weaving who plays the Red Skull and who I personally believe should always play dark sinister characters as he does them oh so well.Be sure and pay close attention to some of the rescues GI's and see if you recognize any of them. Also, be sure and stay for a cool sneak preview of ""The Avengers"" movie after ALL of the credits role by.

Some of the special effects of Steve as a skinny weakling were terrible.

1462744,A3KKM0T1KY42HA,B005IZLPKQ,Sky,"[0, 0]","I thought that Joe Johnston was a good pick to direct Captain America. He's made two movies that I'm quite fond of that are full of action, scares and laughs (Jurassic Park IIIandJumanji), so I figured that with Johnston at the helm for Captain America, we might be in for more of the same. The trailer for Captain America sure made it seem like at least the action would be there, but ultimately I found Captain America to be very slow-moving and the weakest entry among the movies that have been introducing us to next year's Avengers.I admit that I had a preconceived notion about Captain America way before the pre-Avengers movies even started to get made, and my preconceived notion was that Captain America was outdated and quite frankly boring. That was until sometime back in 2008 when I read all 800 pages combined of Mark Millar's epic collections ofThe Ultimates&The Ultimates 2. Those books were nothing short of amazing, and those books introduced me to the Marvel gang in a whole new light, especially Captain America (andThor). Thor quickly became one of my favorite Marvel characters after reading Millar's books, and similarly I gained an entirely new respect for Captain America because of Millar's books. The integrity of Millar's delivery of Captain America is somewhat still in place with Johnston's Captain America; there's just something about Johnston's that made him into more of a campy, corny kind of character that left me unsatisfied by the end of the film.Captain America is a bizarro period piece mostly set in the early 40s that documents Captain America's making and rise. So I think that the campy, corny part of his personality that Johnston instilled was deliberate and meant to suggest it was sort of the natural disposition of a lot of people back then. But for me it just came across as rather droll. Surprisingly, with a cast that includes some other greats like Tommy Lee Jones and Hugo Weaving, you'd think that the drollness might be made up for by stellar acting. But if you ask me, those guys are gravely underused in Captain America.Look, if you want to see the birth of Captain America and keep the continuity of the introduction of the Avengers prior to next year's Avengers blockbuster, I certainly don't recommend skipping Captain America. But if you want to read a MUCH better story with Captain America in a key role read Millar's books.",3,Here He Comes to Save the Day,1320710400,"11 8, 2011",2011,2389,"['thought', 'Joe', 'Johnston', 'was', 'good', 'pick', 'direct', 'Captain', 'America', 'made', 'two', 'movies', ""'m"", 'quite', 'fond', 'are', 'full', 'action', 'scares', 'laughs', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'IIIandJumanji', 'so', 'figured', 'Johnston', 'helm', 'Captain', 'America', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'same', 'trailer', 'Captain', 'America', 'sure', 'made', 'least', 'action', 'would', 'be', 'there', 'ultimately', 'found', 'Captain', 'America', 'be', 'very', 'slow-moving', 'weakest', 'entry', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'introducing', 'next', 'year', 'Avengers.I', 'admit', 'had', 'preconceived', 'notion', 'Captain', 'America', 'way', 'pre-Avengers', 'movies', 'even', 'started', 'get', 'made', 'preconceived', 'notion', 'was', 'Captain', 'America', 'was', 'outdated', 'quite', 'frankly', 'boring', 'was', 'sometime', 'back', '2008', 'when', 'read', '800', 'pages', 'combined', 'Mark', 'Millar', 'epic', 'collections', 'ofThe', 'Ultimates', 'Ultimates', '2', 'books', 'were', 'nothing', 'short', 'amazing', 'books', 'introduced', 'Marvel', 'gang', 'whole', 'new', 'light', 'especially', 'Captain', 'America', 'andThor', 'Thor', 'quickly', 'became', 'one', 'favorite', 'Marvel', 'characters', 'reading', 'Millar', 'books', 'similarly', 'gained', 'entirely', 'new', 'respect', 'Captain', 'America', 'Millar', 'books', 'integrity', 'Millar', 'delivery', 'Captain', 'America', 'somewhat', 'still', 'place', 'Johnston', 'Captain', 'America', 'just', 'something', 'Johnston', 'made', 'more', 'campy', 'corny', 'kind', 'character', 'left', 'unsatisfied', 'end', 'film.Captain', 'America', 'bizarro', 'period', 'piece', 'mostly', 'set', 'early', '40s', 'documents', 'Captain', 'America', 'making', 'rise', 'think', 'campy', 'corny', 'part', 'personality', 'Johnston', 'instilled', 'was', 'deliberate', 'meant', 'suggest', 'was', 'sort', 'natural', 'disposition', 'lot', 'people', 'back', 'then', 'just', 'came', 'rather', 'droll', 'Surprisingly', 'cast', 'other', 'greats', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', ""'d"", 'think', 'drollness', 'might', 'be', 'made', 'up', 'stellar', 'acting', 'ask', 'guys', 'are', 'gravely', 'underused', 'Captain', 'America.Look', 'want', 'see', 'birth', 'Captain', 'America', 'keep', 'continuity', 'introduction', 'Avengers', 'prior', 'next', 'year', 'Avengers', 'blockbuster', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'skipping', 'Captain', 'America', 'want', 'read', 'MUCH', 'better', 'story', 'Captain', 'America', 'key', 'role', 'read', 'Millar', 'books']",N/A

If you like ""Captain America"" -- and given its acting and production values, you probably will - it's because you've seen it all before somewhere else. You can tick off the standards: outcast superhero, Steve Rogers (who's basically the kid that gets sand kicked in his face in those comic book Charles Atlas ads), eccentric but well-meaning scientist with the German-Jewish accent (Albert Einstein, Hans Zarkhov, etc.), sadistic Nazi bastard (take your pick, Indiana Jones movies, The Phantom, The Rocketeer, The Marathon Man, etc.). It's full of romanticized 40s nostalgia, so much so that everyone, even the baddies, is apple-cheeked and there's no need to put minorities in it unless they accidentally walk by in the background. Captain America himself is Hitler's wet dream in the sense that our buff, blond and blue-eyed Olympian is essentially everything the Germans were after, the master race but on our side, by golly, and since Hitler's evil and we're not, it's all okay (and he's got that nifty, muted American flag costume to remind us). None of this is a problem necessarily, but to enjoy ""Captain America,"" you have to be prepared for it. If not, you'll find it pure corn and not a little propagandistic, albeit with a slick retro quality that might make you want to believe the world was ever actually like this. If your politics run toward accusing Hollywood of liberalism, you'll find this movie difficult to fit into that viewpoint.  There's not much to say about the plot.  There's an evil Nazi running around with his own agenda and a wholesome hero who must stop him.  That's about it.  The rest is a well-photographed exercise in flag waving. Chris Evans, who looks like a less creepy version of Ryan Gosling, is fine in the limited role, and his female handler, played by Hayley Atwell, is basically today's version of Emma Peel. Stanley Tucci, Hugo Weaving, and Tommy Lee Jones are quite competent. The film reminded me of Disney's ""The Rocketeer,"" which wasn't surprising given that both were directed by Joe Johnston, who gives the whole thing a Steven Spielberg gloss when he was in his prime.

1462762,A1CLUR3JCYO0TQ,B005IZLPKQ,stevie,"[4, 9]","First of all, I saw this in theatres. I did not buy the blu-ray version. I don't know extra stuff you get for blu-ray. That being said, if the movie is no good (which is the main reason why you would even buy this) then its all for not. Well, how can I put it? This movie is no good.I was really looking forward to this movie and went with a buddy to see it opening day. I was really hoping captain america would save the summer from so called blockbusters that sucked (im looking at you green lantern). It's very hard not use the word bland when it comes to this movie, but thats exactly what it is. It is not a bad movie in the regular sense, but i ceases to do much or take any chances. Some may qualify that as bad. Putting all semantic discussions aside, this movie is frequently boring and sometime down right comical for all the wrong reasons. It was directed by Joe Johnston. Hes a done a few good movies that I enjoyed from my childhood like Jumanji. I was hoping he would keep it interesting, but fails. This movie follows the super hero story cliche without missing a beat. A loser nobody finds himself blessed with new incredible abilities, must overcome personal obstacles, have a fleeting meeting with villain only to fight again at the end and don't forget a love interest thrown in for good measure. Of course, these are how all superhero stories must be told. However, the recent SPiderman and the Batman films have done this so much better. In the batman movies, there is a real struggle going on with bruce wayne. Spiderman 2 also creates an interesting conflict among the characters. All of this is absent in Captain America. Worse than this is the amount of time it takes for the movie to get going. The film doesn't really get going until the second half with only one fight scene up to that point. After an early chase scene after Steve Rogers gets his powers, he is sent to sell war bonds instead of fighting the germans. Apparently, the military thought this would be a better use of a super soldier, to send him around doing song and dance routines to build up moral. This feels like such a waste of time. Finally, the movie eventually starts, but lets you down again. The majority of the action scense are too short and cheesy. Captain America has no problem going behind enemy lines and sneaking into a german base hiding american pow's. A few quick punches and he is inside. Remember that action montage during the commercials? That is the same thing in the movie. That does not take place in any kind of actual fight scene. In the movie, the same montage is used to speed up the story to get to more important parts. Here, Captain America has become more famous and goes around busting up german locations.Not to mention, they totally blew having Hugo Weaving in this movie. They give him nothing to do other than to look angry and brood over the magical blue ancient Nordic orb. This is a glowing rock that has magical properties. The Hydra (Nazi sub group) are trying to somehow harness the energy to of course make a super weapon and take over the world..................sigh. I never read the comics, but i assume this is a part of it. Nevertheless, it just could not look any more silly on screen.Thus, in captain america, we have a movie that has sub par action sequences, cheesy humor, an unexciting plot, and an underutilized villain. I can't really even recommend renting this. Its just not that exciting. As I said, the action scenes never go on long enough and there is too much boring plot filler in between. For some reason, it is highly popular right now at Redbox. You may have to wait awhile to see it. However, definitely do not buy this even on DVD. You will never watch it more than once.",2,Average at best movie,1320019200,"10 31, 2011",2011,3737,"['First', 'saw', 'theatres', 'did', 'not', 'buy', 'blu-ray', 'version', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'extra', 'stuff', 'get', 'blu-ray', 'being', 'said', 'movie', 'good', 'main', 'reason', 'why', 'would', 'even', 'buy', 'then', 'not', 'Well', 'how', 'can', 'put', 'movie', 'good.I', 'was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'movie', 'went', 'buddy', 'see', 'opening', 'day', 'was', 'really', 'hoping', 'captain', 'america', 'would', 'save', 'summer', 'so', 'called', 'blockbusters', 'sucked', 'im', 'looking', 'green', 'lantern', 'very', 'hard', 'not', 'use', 'word', 'bland', 'when', 'movie', 'exactly', 'what', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'regular', 'sense', 'i', 'ceases', 'do', 'much', 'take', 'chances', 'may', 'qualify', 'as', 'bad', 'Putting', 'semantic', 'discussions', 'aside', 'movie', 'frequently', 'boring', 'sometime', 'down', 'right', 'comical', 'wrong', 'reasons', 'was', 'directed', 'Joe', 'Johnston', 'Hes', 'done', 'few', 'good', 'movies', 'enjoyed', 'childhood', 'Jumanji', 'was', 'hoping', 'would', 'keep', 'interesting', 'movie', 'super', 'hero', 'story', 'cliche', 'missing', 'beat', 'loser', 'nobody', 'blessed', 'new', 'incredible', 'abilities', 'must', 'overcome', 'personal', 'obstacles', 'have', 'fleeting', 'meeting', 'villain', 'only', 'fight', 'again', 'end', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'love', 'interest', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure', 'course', 'are', 'how', 'superhero', 'stories', 'must', 'be', 'told', 'However', 'recent', 'SPiderman', 'Batman', 'films', 'have', 'done', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'batman', 'movies', 'real', 'struggle', 'going', 'bruce', 'wayne', 'Spiderman', '2', 'also', 'interesting', 'conflict', 'characters', 'absent', 'Captain', 'America', 'Worse', 'amount', 'time', 'movie', 'get', 'going', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'going', 'second', 'half', 'only', 'one', 'fight', 'scene', 'up', 'point', 'early', 'chase', 'scene', 'Steve', 'Rogers', 'powers', 'sent', 'sell', 'war', 'bonds', 'instead', 'fighting', 'germans', 'Apparently', 'military', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'use', 'super', 'soldier', 'send', 'around', 'doing', 'song', 'dance', 'routines', 'build', 'up', 'moral', 'feels', 'waste', 'time', 'Finally', 'movie', 'eventually', 'down', 'again', 'majority', 'action', 'scense', 'are', 'too', 'short', 'cheesy', 'Captain', 'America', 'problem', 'going', 'enemy', 'lines', 'sneaking', 'german', 'base', 'hiding', 'american', 'pow', 'A', 'few', 'quick', 'punches', 'inside', 'Remember', 'action', 'montage', 'commercials', 'same', 'thing', 'movie', 'not', 'take', 'place', 'kind', 'actual', 'fight', 'scene', 'movie', 'same', 'montage', 'used', 'speed', 'up', 'story', 'get', 'more', 'important', 'parts', 'Here', 'Captain', 'America', 'become', 'more', 'famous', 'around', 'busting', 'up', 'german', 'locations.Not', 'mention', 'totally', 'blew', 'having', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'movie', 'give', 'nothing', 'do', 'other', 'look', 'angry', 'brood', 'magical', 'blue', 'ancient', 'Nordic', 'orb', 'glowing', 'rock', 'magical', 'properties', 'Hydra', 'Nazi', 'sub', 'group', 'are', 'trying', 'somehow', 'energy', 'course', 'make', 'super', 'weapon', 'take', 'world', 'sigh', 'never', 'read', 'comics', 'i', 'assume', 'part', 'Nevertheless', 'just', 'could', 'not', 'look', 'more', 'silly', 'screen.Thus', 'captain', 'america', 'have', 'movie', 'sub', 'par', 'action', 'sequences', 'cheesy', 'humor', 'unexciting', 'plot', 'underutilized', 'villain', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'even', 'recommend', 'renting', 'just', 'not', 'exciting', 'said', 'action', 'scenes', 'never', 'go', 'long', 'enough', 'too', 'much', 'boring', 'plot', 'filler', 'reason', 'highly', 'popular', 'right', 'now', 'Redbox', 'may', 'have', 'wait', 'awhile', 'see', 'However', 'definitely', 'do', 'not', 'buy', 'even', 'DVD', 'will', 'never', 'watch', 'more', 'once']",N/A

Maybe it came out too late in a superhero-saturated summer. It got good reviews generally speaking and did well enough at the box office, but it seems to have been viewed as an also-ran. Some wrote it off as a 'prequel' to The Avengers. It's a terrific self-contained origin story. Tommy Lee Jones does exactly what we expect of him - and does it well, at that. Stanley Tucci delivers a touching supporting role as the first person to truly believe in Steve Rogers. Hugo Weaving never crosses the line into &#34;over the top&#34; territory as the Red Skull.

1462781,A1QRXEM0WSLGT5,B005IZLPKQ,The Man With No Name,"[1, 2]","I like many was concerned when I heard Chris Evans was playing Captain America.  Images of him from 'Not Another Teen Movie' kept flooding back.  BTW, funny movie.  I was just concerned about having a funny man play the ultimate American.  Also he had already played Johnny Storm.  It was kind of weird for him to play another Marvel character.  I was further concerned when I saw he would not be blond in the movie.  FYI, Capt. America is blond in the comics.  So, going into this Marvel flick I had some worries.  I will say my worries were calmed a bit by the epic previews they kept showing before the release of the movie.  I was eventually, cautiously optomistic to say the least.Well, this Fanboy was not disappointed.  The movie turned out GREAT, and was a solid prequel for the upcoming 'Avengers' movie.--Story--The story was exactly what is should be, Steve Rogers in World War II fighting Nazis.  No other story would have been right.  To only have a brief moment of him in the 1940s and then flash forward to 2011, that would have a travesty.**Some Spoilers**The story begins with a Nazi villian, later revealed to be the Red Skull, finding an ancient cube in an old church.  For those not familier, the cube is called the ""Cosmic Cube"" and is VERY powerful.  The Red Skull is portrayed by Hugo Weaving.  Excellant casting decision by the way.  Just the right amount of sinister and intelligence.  The cube once harnessed by the Red Skull's scientist is able to power all his advanced weaponry.  These weapons are powerful enough to definitely gurantine victory for the Axis powers.Enter Stever Rogers, a small, sickly man who is 100 percent adamant about serving his country in the armed forces.  Kudos to the CG department for making Chris Evans look so small.  Well Steve hops from city to city hoping at least one doctor will clear him medically to serve.  So far he's been turned down every time.Finally he comes across an army medical doctor/scientist, played perfectly by Stanley Tucci, who offers Steve the chance he's be looking for.  It turns out this doctor has perfected a ""Super Soldier Serum"" and is looking for the right candidate to try it on.  It is revealed in a flash back scene that the Red Skull looks the way he does because he tryed an early batch on himself.  Stanley Tucci's character is concerned who to try it on, as the formula only amplifies what's already in a person.  I.E. a good man becomes GREAT, and a bad man becomes a HORRIBLE monster.Thus, after going through some basic training overseen by none other than the great Tommy Lee Jones, Rogers is selected and prepped for the procedure.  BTW, another great decision casting Tommy Lee Jones...We at this point get another great character entry, Howard Stark.  Howard is none other than the father of Tony Stark, aka Iron-Man.  Howard is in my opinion just like Howard Hughes.  That's what the writers of the comics and this movie are going for and it shows, in a good way.  Howard is already a millionare and works on top-secret projects for the U.S. Government.  He builds the chamber Steve Rogers becomes Captain America in.  This will no doubt be a plot point in the 'Avengers' movie.  Expect Captain America to say something on the lines of ""I knew your father Tony, and your not him..."", or something like that.Anyway, shortly after the successful procedure, a buff Chris Evans exits the chamber.  The lab is blown up and the doctor is shot by a Nazi spy.  Thus the exact formula is lost with the good doctor.  It also means that Steve Rogers, at least for the forseeable future is the only ""Super Soldier"".It's at this point that the movie loses pace a little.  We see Captain America dancing and singing his way around America selling war bonds.  I would have much rather seen him go right into action.Luckily this doesn't last too long.  Steve feels horrible for not fighting, and once his old pal Bucky Barnes is kidnapped he sets off on his own for a one man rescue.The film then regains it's pace.  We get a lot of action and some pretty cool shield throwing scenes.  Howard Stark outfits Steve with a pretty cool uniform, (which looks WAY better than what he's wearing in the 'Avengers), and gives him his vibranium shield.  Captain America puts together his own rag-tag bunch of soldiers, his A-Team so to speak...and they go on some pretty high octane missions together.Well...to move things along.  Steve loses Bucky, or so it seems...and after stopping the Red Skull's forces and the Red Skull himself, crashes the Red Skull's plane into an ice-filled ocean.  The ship would have killed a lot of people if it made it to America.  The Cosmic Cube is recovered by Howard Stark, and later seen at the end of 'Thor'.  Unfortunately Cap is not found until 2011.  This is a sad scene, as you know he will never see the woman he loved again.  He is a man out of time, with friends and loved ones long gone.--Pros--Great casting.  Great costume, followed the Ultimate Captain America design.  Great writing.  The scenery is truly realistic in it's appearance.  If it wouldn't be for the futuristic tanks and energy weapons that the Red Skull's forces used, you'd swear you were back in WWII.Having us the viewer see Steve Rogers before and after his transformation is what REALLY made this film.  Again, kudos to the CG department.This film, although it can stand on it's own, IS really a prequel to the 'Avengers' and helps to tie 'Thor' and 'Iron-Man' together, pretty well actually.--Cons--My only gripe was seeing Captain America singing and dancing.  Although this was not long, I did not enjoy it and think it took the character down a notch.  Why would a man so adamant about being a soldier stoop to doing this.Only gripe though,  movie gets back on track soon afterward.  So I only docked one star.  Also I would have prefered to see Steve Rogers blond.  I can see why they choose to go with brown though.  After all the Nazi's were blond haired, blue eyed.  Still, he is blond in the comics and in the 'Ultimate Avengers' movies.  This is just a minor Fanboy gripe though...--In Conclusion--Stellar movie, a MUST own for any Marvel fan.  I plan on buying the BLU-RAY edition, once I finally buy a BLU-RAY player.  From what I've been reading, you get the most deleted scenes and bonus features with the BLU-RAY.Really liked this movie and can't wait to see the 'Avengers'.

1462782,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B005IZLPKQ,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[52, 69]","The movie starts at its WWII origins. Chris Evans plays Steve Rogers a puny 4F man who has lied his way into a military science experiment. Tommy Lee Jones plays an excellent Colonel. Meanwhile evil Nazi Hugo Weaving believing he is Darth Maul, has his own plans for world conquest using sharks with frickin' laser beams. (Just kidding about the sharks.) Rogers is a 90 pound weakling who displays intellect, courage, and guts. He is selected for the military's secret program and is transformed into a muscular super hero. The special effects were very good, although we do know from ""Last Action Hero"" you can't really jump around car roofs. After Rogers is transformed he becomes Captain America to be used as a recruiting tool, as Tommy Lee still has his doubts about the 90 pound weakling.Of course things change and the rest of the story shouldn't be too hard to figure out, even if you don't read comics. Now the very end utilizes the one-eyed Samuel L. Jackson from Iron Man 2 which hints at an ultimate sequel providing everyone isn't dead by then.The movie combines action, drama, light comedy, and light romance.

1462783,A2VUD4SPJO4V33,B005IZLPKQ,Theo,"[6, 8]","Marvel's Cinematic Universe has been a rather patchy effort. There have been good films, such asIron Man, but there have also been deeply mediocre ones, such asThor. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that this was one of their better efforts.Like so many superhero flicks, this film is a retelling of its central hero's origin story. Of course, in Captain America's case, any such retelling must deal with two fundamental problems:First, anyone with even the slightest acquaintance with the Marvel Universe knows exactly how this story ends, and the fates of all its major protagonists. Incidentally, for the sake of completeness, yes, I'm now giving you a SPOILER ALERT. But I promise I'm not going to give away anything that anyone who's ever read a Marvel comic book isn't fully aware of anyway.The screenwriters deal with the problem that we already know how the story ends by beginning with that ending: the wreckage in an ice-strewn landscape where we all know the frozen body of Captain America lies, awaiting resurrection. The point is, they're letting us know that they know that we know. There's no pretence otherwise, so we can all just get on with it. They then go back and tell us the tale of how it all came to this.Interestingly, quite early on, there is a scene in which the Red Skull is listening to a recording of the iconic ""Siegfried's Death And Funeral Music"". On one level it's an obvious, perhaps even trite choice of entertainment for a Nazi supervillain. Yet I can't help but wonder if there is a deeper point being made here. There is something operatic about this saga, as its larger than life characters follow their inevitable course to a conclusion as pre-ordained as that of any stage tragedy.The second fundamental problem the filmmakers must grapple with is that we are dealing with a hero whose origins lie in an age with values profoundly different to our own. Closely entwined with this is the fact that the level of maturity we expect from the superhero genre has also increased beyond all recognition. Together, this combination of developments mean that what was right on the money in the middle of WWII can easily come across as ridiculously, even insultingly jingoistic today.Yet once again, all of these difficulties are dealt with rather skillfully. In particular I'm talking about how the identity of ""Captain America"" is created for our hero. However, I'm not going to say any more than that. For those who haven't yet seen the film, I think it's best not to give even a hint. I don't want to deprive you of the pleasure of seeing how all this unfolds for yourself.One thing I am going to tell you is that a big part of what makes this story work on a more timeless level is that there is far more emphasis on an aspect of the Captain America character that is usually neglected: the frail youth who was refused for military service on grounds of medical unfitness. Not in a facile, Charles Atlas kind of way where the ""bag of bones"" turns into jock who then smacks around the bullies. Rather, it's more about providing the moral core of the character. A core that stays with him from the very beginning of the film to its very end.Beyond these most basic issues, there are a number of other points worth mentioning. In keeping with the spirit of this updated retelling, the character of Bucky Barnes is likewise rather deftly re-imagined for an audience no longer so inclined to accept the idea of a child soldier as a harmless fantasy. I also loved the Nazi ""super science"" we see in the film. It's interesting to compare what we see here to the legends that exist in our own world. I say ""legends"" because while they certainly have a basis in real technology, they also rapidly extend into the stuff of pure myth. If you're unfamiliar with what I'm referring to here, try Googling ""Nazi bell"" sometime and you'll see what I mean. This film captures that spirit perfectly. It also ties in no less perfectly with Captain America's own comic book origins.But what really makes this movie a success is the conviction of the writers, the director, and the actors. All too often with superhero flicks, a film falls down because it's just so staggeringly obvious that the people who made it had no real respect for their source material. They're just churning out yet another summer blockbuster - or so they hope.Quite recently, in a review of theGreen Lanternmovie, I said that when someone like Frank Miller comes along and thinks seriously about who his characters are and why they do the things they do, it shows. Similarly so on the acting front when people like Christian Bale and Kevin Conroy portray the Bat. But when someone comes along and says ""Hey, let's do a summer blockbuster - we'll make tons of money!"", that also shows.It was the latter kind of thinking that shone through in the Green Lantern movie. Also in Marvel's own Thor. But not, I'm happy to say, in this work.This is a film made by people who genuinely thought about their characters and their universe. As a result, they have given cinematic expression to both with integrity, just the right level of realism, and finally, with respect for both their source material and their audience.Theo.",5,The

Downplayed was overt patriotism (consider that the America he inhabited, as the moviegoer is shown, was rife with failure: Stark's hovering expo car that faltered; the infiltration of the laboratory and death of Steve Roger's mentor/ creator, Dr. Erskine; Cap's initial sidelining by way of buffoonish salesman) and played up was the comic and the cartoonish.  It was probably a good choice and the story flowed and was well handled.  Opting to keep our flag-figured hero in his patriotic colors was as far as Marvel seemed to want to push this but their ways of finding nods to his history were very satisfying (see: Cap's initial ""buffoonish"" salesman costume complete with unwieldy, pointed shield).  The humor was well-played and gratifying (Stark's hovering car that work and his quips that did; the off-set, griseled Colonel Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones) being satisfyling wrong about his thoughts of who should rise to the head of the super-soldier pack; Peggy Carter, feeling jealous, firing at Cap's new shield) and The Red Skull was a capable menace, an anti-Captain America if you will, but he wasn't too capable.  I liked very much that he was a failed test of Erskine's and Hugo Weaving played him with a calculated accent.  Chris Evans did a more than fine job, so much so that I accepted him rather quickly and completely forgot that he was ever the Human Torch (played a fantastic Torch BTW)!  Evans actually showed off some acting chops, playing with humor and awkwardness and appropriate pathos.  Where I think Marvel missed the mark was in not having a face-to-face with Hitler, with not focusing (even a little bit) on the horrors of WWII.  This would have grounded the film (a la X-men: First Class) and given it more emotional weight.  But it's still a fun ride and a very good superhero movie without it.  Upon first viewing I thought that the Red Skull was played as a fairly weak villain (he was compared to the comics) but on my second viewing his screen presence and effect was very much close to right (he certainly wasn't a non-event like first Fantastic Four's Doctor Doom).  Overall a gratifying comic book movie experience.One more thing: for those of you who have passed on the extra features I encourage you to check out how they ""made"" Captain America/ Steve Rogers.  I thought that they just used another actor the entire time and transposed Evans' face (which they did part of the time) but for parts of it it is all Evans, slimmed down and smoothed away by a computer.

It is a well known fact, that while I'm a Science Fiction fanatic, I hate superheroes and comics. I wanted to see Captain America though, because I'm fascinated by the Avengers. I really can't see how all those big stars are going to work together, so I wanted to see all the films leading up to the Avengers, so I could follow along. Tommy Lee Jones, one of my favorite actors of all time, is one of the stars of this film, and I know he won't sign on to do just anything, so I knew that Captain America would at the very least be watchable. The more and more I got into Captain America, the most surprised I was by it's realism and honesty, it's not just the story of another superhero and how he's going to fit into the Avengers, it's the story of a very likeable character who wants to be something more than he is. I also loved the fact that this film took place in the 1940's as opposed to the modern era, because it gave a uniqueness to the story. I didn't feel like I was watching another Superman or Batman type of movie, I was really seeing something unique. The cast was fantastic, Chris Evans in particular, I don't know where the people who do the casting for these movies keep finding these guys, but each newcomer is better than the last. Captain America is unique and doesn't feel like a superhero out of some comic book. Comics are often based in extreme fantasy and appeal to those who want to escape their reality. Captain America was different though as he choses not to runaway, but to continually better himself, making him a uniquely remarkable character and it's those qualities that helped make a unique and remarkable film.",5,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,1361491200,"02 22, 2013",2013,1769,"[""'m"", 'sure', 'regular', 'followers', 'blog', 'are', 'shocked', 'see', 'gave', 'superhero/comic', 'book', 'movie', 'perfect', 'rating', 'well', 'known', 'fact', ""'m"", 'Science', 'Fiction', 'fanatic', 'hate', 'superheroes', 'comics', 'wanted', 'see', 'Captain', 'America', ""'m"", 'fascinated', 'Avengers', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'big', 'stars', 'are', 'going', 'work', 'together', 'wanted', 'see', 'films', 'leading', 'up', 'Avengers', 'could', 'follow', 'along', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'time', 'one', 'stars', 'film', 'know', 'wo', ""n't"", 'sign', 'do', 'just', 'anything', 'knew', 'Captain', 'America', 'would', 'very', 'least', 'be', 'watchable', 'more', 'more', 'got', 'Captain', 'America', 'most', 'surprised', 'was', 'realism', 'honesty', 'not', 'just', 'story', 'superhero', 'how', 'going', 'fit', 'Avengers', 'story', 'very', 'likeable', 'character', 'who', 'be', 'something', 'more', 'also', 'loved', 'fact', 'film', 'took', 'place', '1940', 'opposed', 'modern', 'era', 'gave', 'uniqueness', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'watching', 'Superman', 'Batman', 'type', 'movie', 'was', 'really', 'seeing', 'something', 'unique', 'cast', 'was', 'fantastic', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'particular', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'people', 'who', 'do', 'casting', 'movies', 'keep', 'finding', 'guys', 'newcomer', 'better', 'last', 'Captain', 'America', 'unique', ""n't"", 'feel', 'superhero', 'comic', 'book', 'Comics', 'are', 'often', 'based', 'extreme', 'fantasy', 'appeal', 'who', 'want', 'escape', 'reality', 'Captain', 'America', 'was', 'different', 'not', 'runaway', 'continually', 'better', 'making', 'uniquely', 'remarkable', 'character', 'qualities', 'helped', 'make', 'unique', 'remarkable', 'film']",N/A

1462807,AMF52GSX309V0,B005IZLPKQ,Tony S.,"[0, 0]","Captain America is one of the most beloved Marvel Superheros ever. It's kind of sad that it took this long to get his own movie considering what he represents.  The character of Steve Rogers, played by Chris Evans, is an interesting one.  He is small, puny and wants nothing more than to be a soldier in the U.S. Military.  When a doctor creates a serum to help him become physically superior soldier, that's when all the fun happens.  Let's go!What I liked about the movie:The CastThe cast, both starring and supporting, were very impressive in this movie.  I didn't know how to feel about Chris Evans as Captain America.  I always thought he was a good actor for genre films, but didn't know if he could command attention as a superhero.  Rest assured, he's great!  In the first act, pre-serum injections, his acting ability really comes through.  The audience will feel sympathy for the kid from Brooklyn who wants nothing more than to serve his country.  Evans shows us that Steve Rogers was a good MAN, way before he was a good superhero.  Nicely Done!The supporting cast was very awesome!  Hugo Weaving as the main villain, Red Skull, was great.  Even the cheesy accent was ok with me.  Weaving has the voice, arrogance and presence needed to play the villain.  I enjoyed his work very much.  Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter was a delight on screen, not the usual damsel in distress.  Tommy Lee Jones plays a perfect Colonel in the Military, he is compassionate enough for us to care about him, but stern enough to lead in a war.  Stanley Tucci... is there anything Tucci can't do?!  He's awesome as the Doctor who invents the serum for Steve Rogers.  Sebastian Stan plays Bucky, Steve Rogers best friend, nicely done by the young actor.The SettingThe movie mostly takes place during World War II.  The production design team does such an amazing job with the set pieces, the costumes, etc.  What's also impressive is the lighting, and camera work.  Shelly Johnson used just the right lighting that gave the movie an older feel without overdoing it.  It was nice to see a superhero film that wasn't in modern day times.The Story / WritingSimple, easy to follow and exciting.  Hugo Weaving's character believes in &#34;magic&#34; which was stolen from Odin's vault.  It is the Cosmic Cube which has been referenced in the Marvel Universe of films.  It has a great deal of power and, if harnessed correctly, could destroy every major city in the world.  Captain America and company must stop Red Skull from doing so.  The writing is clever and I never rolled my eyes at any horrible dialogue.  The writers were clever and even made fun of the Captain America suit before we could as an audience.  I love when writers acknowledge things like that without making it obvious!What I liked and didn't like about the film:The DirectorJoe Johnston has done a lot of work in Hollywood.  He made a great name for himself with popular films like Honey, I Shrunk The Kids, The Rocketeer, Jumanji, October Sky and Jurassic Park III.  I think he's a good storyteller, but there are aspects of his films that just don't click.  His movies always look great, he can always get a terrific cast to work with him, and the stories are usually pretty enticing.  I will tell you this, this movie is MUCH better than the atrocious The Wolfman from a few years ago.  Most of the things I enjoyed in the film are because of him.  As are the things I didn't enjoy.What I didn't like about the film:The ActionIt's too bad, this is an action film and the action is silly.  There are multiple action scenes with hundreds of henchmen at war with our Military.  Henchmen and soldiers alike are being killed so often, we don't feel any real loss.  I've said it before and I'll say it again, action should only compliment the story, not take it over.  The final action sequence was impressive though with many intricate camera shots.  Didn't totally leave a sour taste in my mouth.The ScoreI feel I pay very close attention to film scores.  I can tell you which ones work and which ones don't in my opinion.  The average movie going public probably doesn't even care, but I do!  It didn't evoke emotion, it didn't make me care and I never felt like I was pulled into 100%.  The score should have been big, uplifting even.  This is Captain America damn it!  He's viewed as the leader of The Avengers and the score should have matched.The Verdict:Liked it very muchI enjoyed the movie very much.  I know I listed a few things I didn't like, but they weren't deal breakers.  It was great to see a modern day superhero in the past.  We grow with the character, figuratively and literally.  Steve Rogers is a good man who just lacked the physical stature to do great things.  He stood up for those who are bullied and did what was right.  I can't wait for The Avengers next year, it will be another chance to see Captain America in action!",4,Captain America: The First Avenger review; it's a great superhero film,1356220800,"12 23,

1462809,ADS4S2JI2P0DI,B005IZLPKQ,Tracy Wythe,"[0, 0]","I should probably start off by mentioning that I have never read any comic books related to Captain America, so I had no prior knowledge about the characters in the movie. I honestly didn't really know whether I'd like the movie or not when I bought it. I usually like watching movies based on comic book superheroes, even if I haven't read the comic books beforehand. I guess I just like the idea of watching comic book characters come to life in these types of movies. Sometimes, I decide to check on this site to see what the average rating is for a movie before buying it. In this case, I decided to get it on a whim instead. After having seen it, I have to say that I definitely enjoyed watching it for the most part. Due to the fact that I hadn't read any Captain America comic books prior to seeing the movie, the ending definitely surprised me more than a little bit. Chris Evans did a pretty good job in his role as Captain America. I remembered him from when he was in the Fantastic Four movies a few years ago. Hugo Weaving was convincing as the evil villain of the movie. When the villain of a movie can get an audience member to want to see them vanquished by the good guy, it means that the actor is doing his job, and doing it well. This movie left me wanting to know what will happen next in the story because of what happened at the end. I don't say that about every movie. Then again, not every movie I watch has an ending to it that leaves room for a sequel.

1462810,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B005IZLPKQ,trebe,"[0, 1]","While some of the Marvel superhero films don't do a great job of adhering to the source material, Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) does better than most, as it succeeds in capturing to a large degree, the spirit of the comics which saw the genesis of the character during World War II.  The film features Captain America battling his greatest and most ruthless adversary, Red Skull, the personification of Nazi cunning and fighting spirit, and the leader of the Third Reich's secret weapons branch.In superhero movies, setup and character origins typically eat up a nice chunk of time in the initial film.  That is somewhat true here, but the process is streamlined by Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), the future Captain America, not having a complicated backstory, and the action being set in the already familiar setting of World War II.The year is 1942, and a patriotic Steve Rogers has once again been classified 4F, and rejected by the army.  Recruited by Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci), the scrawny Rogers finds himself in uniform, as a volunteer in a top secret experimental program to develop an enhanced fighting man.  The process is successful, as Rogers becomes a muscular specimen, but when Erskine is assassinated, the secret of the process is lost.Instead of an army of supersoldiers, there is just Rogers, and as the costumed ""Captain America"" he is used mainly as a public relations tool for the red, white, and blue.  Under the command of Colonel Chester Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones), Rogers is in Italy entertaining the troops, when he learns that his friend Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) has been reported missing, while battling German forces led by Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving).  With the help of British intelligence agent Peggy Carter (Haley Atwell), Rogers embarks on an unauthorized rescue mission.Dressed as Captain America, Rogers frees Barnes and other American soldiers being held prisoner.  Schmidt the leader of a force of specially trained HYDRA agents, reveals himself as Red Skull, a man who has aspirations that exceed even Hitler's.  Rogers puts together a strike force, and sets out to destroy all of HYDRA's forces, leading to a dramatic final battle with Red Skull, and setting the stage for Captain America's appearance in The Avengers (2012).With World War II as the canvas against which the action takes place, Captain America: The First Avenger successfully captures some of the spirit of the comics, while adding a ton of high-tech enhancements.  There isn't much time devoted to character development, as director  Joe Johnson focuses on keeping things moving, and making the second half of this darkly atmospheric fantasy, as action oriented as possible.Although the war becomes a complete parody, borrowing from films like Star Wars, and Raiders of the Lost Ark, Captain America is still one of the better Marvel adaptations to date.  With a rating of 4.5 stars, don't miss this one while it is available on Amazon Prime.",4,captain america battles red skull and his elite hydra force...,1348099200,"09 20, 2012",2012,2976,"['Marvel', 'superhero', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'great', 'job', 'adhering', 'source', 'material', 'Captain', 'America', 'First', 'Avenger', '2011', 'better', 'most', 'capturing', 'large', 'degree', 'spirit', 'comics', 'saw', 'genesis', 'character', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'film', 'features', 'Captain', 'America', 'battling', 'greatest', 'most', 'ruthless', 'adversary', 'Red', 'Skull', 'personification', 'Nazi', 'cunning', 'fighting', 'spirit', 'leader', 'Third', 'Reich', 'secret', 'weapons', 'branch.In', 'superhero', 'movies', 'setup', 'character', 'origins', 'typically', 'eat', 'up', 'nice', 'chunk', 'time', 'initial', 'film', 'somewhat', 'true', 'here', 'process', 'streamlined', 'Steve', 'Rogers', 'Chris', 'Evans', 'future', 'Captain', 'America', 'not', 'having', 'complicated', 'backstory', 'action', 'being', 'set', 'already', 'familiar', 'setting', 'World', 'War', 'II.The', 'year', '1942', 'patriotic', 'Steve', 'Rogers', 'once', 'again', 'been', 'classified', '4F', 'rejected', 'army', 'Recruited', 'Dr.', 'Abraham', 'Erskine', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'scrawny', 'Rogers', 'uniform', 'volunteer', 'top', 'secret', 'experimental', 'program', 'develop', 'enhanced', 'fighting', 'man', 'process', 'successful', 'Rogers', 'muscular', 'specimen', 'when', 'Erskine', 'assassinated', 'secret', 'process', 'lost.Instead', 'army', 'supersoldiers', 'just', 'Rogers', 'costumed', 'Captain', 'America', 'used', 'mainly', 'public', 'relations', 'tool', 'red', 'white', 'blue', 'command', 'Colonel', 'Chester', 'Phillips', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'Rogers', 'Italy', 'entertaining', 'troops', 'when', 'friend', 'Bucky', 'Barnes', 'Sebastian', 'Stan', 'been', 'reported', 'missing', 'battling', 'German', 'forces', 'led', 'Johann', 'Schmidt', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'help', 'British', 'intelligence', 'agent', 'Peggy', 'Carter', 'Haley', 'Atwell', 'Rogers', 'unauthorized', 'rescue', 'mission.Dressed', 'Captain', 'America', 'Rogers', 'Barnes', 'other', 'American', 'soldiers', 'being', 'held', 'prisoner', 'Schmidt', 'leader', 'force', 'specially', 'trained', 'HYDRA', 'agents', 'reveals', 'Red', 'Skull', 'man', 'who', 'aspirations', 'exceed', 'even', 'Hitler', 'Rogers', 'together', 'strike', 'force', 'out', 'destroy', 'HYDRA', 'forces', 'leading', 'dramatic', 'final', 'battle', 'Red', 'Skull', 'setting', 'stage', 'Captain', 'America', 'appearance', 'Avengers', '2012', '.With', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'canvas', 'action', 'place', 'Captain', 'America', 'First', 'Avenger', 'successfully', 'spirit', 'comics', 'adding', 'ton', 'high-tech', 'enhancements', ""n't"", 'much', 'time', 'devoted', 'character', 'development', 'director', 'Joe', 'Johnson', 'keeping', 'things', 'moving', 'making', 'second', 'half', 'darkly', 'atmospheric', 'fantasy', 'action', 'oriented', 'war', 'complete', 'parody', 'borrowing', 'films', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Raiders', 'Lost', 'Ark', 'Captain', 'America', 'still', 'one', 'better', 'Marvel', 'adaptations', 'date', 'rating', '4.5', 'stars', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'one', 'available', 'Amazon', 'Prime']",N/A

1462812,A2J9COKR9JAZUQ,B005IZLPKQ,"Trey David Wood ""The Sleeper Must Awaken""","[1, 2]","After seeing Iron Man one and two, The Incredible Hulk, Thor, and now Captain America, it seems pretty clear that Marvel knows what it's doing when it comes to making its comics into movies. So far, none of Marvel's cinematic offerings have flopped commercially or critically, and Captain America is just another notch on its belt.  My basic view of the movie is that it fits into the overall tone and style of Marvel's previous movies, it has an excellent cast, its story and script are quite good, and it made me even more excited to see next summer's unprecedented movie project The Avengers.Chris Evans is great as Captain America.  If anyone has any qualms about him because of his involvement in the mediocre Fantastic Four movies, then they will be put swiftly to rest within the first twenty minutes of Captain America. There is nothing about his portrayal of Captain America that made me once think of Johnny Storm (Human Torch). Nor, happily, did it put me in mind of his hilarious turn as an Evil Ex in the epic and underrated Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World.Hugo Weaving as Red Skull is predictably awesome, and the rest of the cast does a great job as well.One interesting aspect of the movie is that the character Howard Stark (Tony Stark's father) has a prominent role in the movie.  So in  The Avengers movie there will already be an interesting dynamic between Captain America and Iron Man, since they will have both known Tony's father in a different capacity.  Also, if you've already seen Thor (And why wouldn't you have?) then you will recognize  that the mysterious relic of power in Captain America is shown in an ""Easter Egg"" scene after the final credits in Thor.As some have noted, there is a marked similarity between the whimsical and classic adventure tone of Captain America and that of the Indiana Jones series, although Captain America is far more in keeping with the vintage Indiana Jones spirit than the disappointing Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. This is what the fourth Indiana Jones movie should have been like-- well, sort of.In any case, anyone that has enjoys Marvel's offerings so far is sure to enjoy Captain America.  Let's hope they can pull off their major movie gamble next summer so they can continue putting out excellent action movies without delay.",4,More solid Marvel entertainment.,1319155200,"10 21, 2011",2011,2294,"['seeing', 'Iron', 'Man', 'one', 'two', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'Thor', 'now', 'Captain', 'America', 'pretty', 'clear', 'Marvel', 'what', 'doing', 'when', 'making', 'comics', 'movies', 'So', 'far', 'none', 'Marvel', 'cinematic', 'offerings', 'have', 'flopped', 'commercially', 'critically', 'Captain', 'America', 'just', 'notch', 'belt', 'basic', 'view', 'movie', 'overall', 'tone', 'style', 'Marvel', 'previous', 'movies', 'excellent', 'cast', 'story', 'script', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'excited', 'see', 'next', 'summer', 'unprecedented', 'movie', 'project', 'Avengers.Chris', 'Evans', 'great', 'Captain', 'America', 'anyone', 'qualms', 'involvement', 'mediocre', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'movies', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'put', 'swiftly', 'rest', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'Captain', 'America', 'nothing', 'portrayal', 'Captain', 'America', 'made', 'once', 'think', 'Johnny', 'Storm', 'Human', 'Torch', 'happily', 'did', 'put', 'mind', 'hilarious', 'turn', 'Evil', 'Ex', 'epic', 'underrated', 'Scott', 'Pilgrim', 'Vs', 'World.Hugo', 'Weaving', 'Red', 'Skull', 'predictably', 'awesome', 'rest', 'cast', 'great', 'job', 'well.One', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'movie', 'character', 'Howard', 'Stark', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'father', 'prominent', 'role', 'movie', 'So', 'Avengers', 'movie', 'there', 'will', 'already', 'be', 'interesting', 'dynamic', 'Captain', 'America', 'Iron', 'Man', 'will', 'have', 'known', 'Tony', 'father', 'different', 'capacity', 'Also', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'Thor', 'why', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'then', 'will', 'recognize', 'mysterious', 'relic', 'power', 'Captain', 'America', 'shown', 'Easter', 'Egg', 'scene', 'final', 'credits', 'Thor.As', 'have', 'noted', 'marked', 'similarity', 'whimsical', 'classic', 'adventure', 'tone', 'Captain', 'America', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'series', 'Captain', 'America', 'far', 'more', 'keeping', 'vintage', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'spirit', 'disappointing', 'Kingdom', 'Crystal', 'Skull', 'what', 'fourth', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'well', 'sort', 'of.In', 'case', 'anyone', 'Marvel', 'offerings', 'so', 'far', 'sure', 'enjoy', 'Captain', 'America', 'Let', 'hope', 'can', 'pull', 'off', 'major', 'movie', 'gamble', 'next', 'summer', 'can', 'continue', 'putting', 'out', 'excellent', 'action', 'movies', 'delay']",N/A

A Nazi officer (Hugo Weaving) and his men lead a raid in order to steal an object of great power and mystery. Simultaneously, in NYC, we see Steve Rogers (played in 98-pound-weakling form a la Benjamin Button by Chris Pine). Rogers (Pine) is being denied the opportunity to serve his country in the military due to various physical issues. Not long after this, however, a mysterious man (Stanley Tucci) offers him the opportunity to be a part of the Army's new super soldier program. And, with a little delay, Captain America is born.Having never read the original comic books, I can't speak to their endearing qualities. And their timely inception no doubt did a great deal to inspire its readers, but the tone of the film is campy, and I don't believe it was meant to be. In addition, Pine (Captain America) doesn't really have the gravitas to pull of the role.

1462814,A2OCJNB6B46OKP,B005IZLPKQ,"Underground Reborn ""gnome""","[0, 0]","Captain America, is one of the oldest comic book heroes, up there with Superman and Batman. For some reason, he never had the spotlight like those other two. In fact he was a hero that was practically crapped on with plenty of horrible representations in other various media. With the Avengers story line doing so well in the box office, Marvel finally reached the story line of this superhero, and I am glad to say that Captain America has finally witnessed justice.`Captain America: The First Avenger' is, in fact a prequel to all the other films we have seen until now. It is the story that takes place during World War Two, and the creation of a soldier that was able to take the enemy down. The job was not given to the strongest, or the brashest of men. In fact it was given to a man who was as imperfect as you can get, but his eagerness to put others in front of himself and his want to right wrongs, gave this man the chance to be something great. With that, Captain America was born.This film was so enjoyable, the cast was very well put together. While I was curious about Chris Evans playing this specific hero, I was impressed. The rest of the cast including Hugo Weaving and Tommy Lee Jones were well placed and fun to watch. What I was happy about the most was the tribute that this film played to Captain America's history in comics, with a lot of references that are scattered throughout the film. To me, this may have been the most accurate depiction of a super hero, even giving Christopher Nolan's Batman a run for its money on accuracy.This is a movie you will like, even if you have never seen any of the other Marvel Studio films, it is a simple, yet complex story and loads of fun.",4,Finally Gets His Dues.

Dr. Abraham Erksine (Stanley Tucci) thinks he is the perfect candidate for his ""super soldier"" serum that will create a stronger, faster superhuman perfected after it was first used on Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving). Schmidt turned into a monster--known as the Red Skull who also commands Hitler's elite Hydra group. Roger's volunteers, undergoes the treatment and lives up to Erksine's dream. At first confined to Bond selling events as Captain America by Colonel Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones) the military head of the program, Rogers goes into action when his best friend ""Bucky"" Barnes (Sebastian Stan)is taken by Schmidt's men along with the rest of the 107th division.END OF SPOILERS:Evans does a superb job of balancing Cap's humanity with a generous dose of humor avoiding a campy tone. Packed with terrific supporting performers ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" stands as one of the best Marvel films made (along with the first two ""Spider-Man"" films by Sam Raimi, the ""Iron Man"" films by Jon Favreau and the first two ""X-Men"" films by Bryan Singer)continuing a winning streak for the studio.The direction by Johnston nicely balances the story and characterization with the stunts and action sequences of the film. Using a modern rap around sequence does a nice job of bridging the era the bulk of the film takes place in and bringing it into the 21st century for the next film.Shot in 3D (rather than being a conversation after the fact)enhances the film although it isn't necessary to see the film in that format to enjoy it. Still, Johnston makes excellent use of the 3D format without bashing the audience over the head with it and, unlike most movies, Johnston doesn't adjust his cutting style for the 3D format (3D doesn't handle rapid fire editing all that well)but then again his editing style here echoes an earlier era of film.Highly recommended.",5,"""Rogers how do you feel?""

It is not the media players (that are all inadequate) but the discs and the makers of laptops and the laptops sound scheme.Wearing 3D glasses and ear phones is a real hassle on a laptop. How stupid are these studios and computer makers and MicroSoft? The answer is completely stupid and greedy.Wait,there is more. The same applies to the newer plasma/LED/LCD TVs too.

Captain America is a damn good movie with piss poor sound volume and nothing really in your face in 3D. My LED LG 3D TV can not overcome the inadequate sound nor can my Asus 3D Blu-Ray laptop from Amazon.No consumer should have to spend additional hundreds of dollars to amplify the sound on their 3D TV or any new TV so they can hear it. The same for a laptop.Studios need in your face 3D or they are going to go belly up.Me, I want swords, fists, hatchets, bullets, rattle snakes uncoiling in my face on the screen. If you can not duck in a 3D movie then it ain't worth buying.Captain America is a terrific movie. The lousy sound spoils it.I know I will get a rebuttal from an employee at LG and Microsoft who will make an attempt to cover up their failings with things like it is strictly the media player (god forbid we deliberately screwed up).

One of the best things of the film is that it is a World War II movie and a super-hero movie all rolled into one. Faithful to the character's comic-book origin and with overtones of patriotism and good 'ol fashioned American values, the movie is somewhat of a throwback to old time movie-making story-telling. MARVEL studios went all out to make the tone just right and the production values top-notch with excellent casting. From Tommy Lee Jones in a great support roll as Col. Chester Phillips, Hugo Weaving as the Red Skull/Johann Schmidt, the Howard Hughes composit Howard Stark (father to Tony Stark aka IRON MAN)played by Dominic Cooper, Chris Evans is excellent in the title role, and finally Stanley Tucci is perfectly cast as Dr. Abraham Erskine (the kindly scientist who sees the good in Steve Rogers to make him the candidate to use his scientific research and create Captain America)... The film delivers on all parts of the super-hero film genre.

He isn't an anti-hero killing bad guys because he can, instead he is defending freedoms, doing what is right, and showing heroism by being willing to give his life for others and by leading others on the front-lines.  I also appreciate the fact that even before his super soldier status he was shown to be willing to stand up to bullies even knowing he was going to get hurt.  IMO all of these traits combined make for a true hero.",5,Doing what's right because it is the right thing to do,1396656000,"04 5, 2014",2014,549,"['title', 'exactly', 'what', 'love', 'about', 'Captain', 'America', 'also', 'think', 'great', 'role', 'model', 'kids', 'today', ""n't"", 'anti-hero', 'killing', 'bad', 'guys', 'can', 'instead', 'defending', 'freedoms', 'doing', 'what', 'right', 'showing', 'heroism', 'being', 'willing', 'give', 'life', 'others', 'leading', 'others', 'front-lines', 'also', 'appreciate', 'fact', 'even', 'super', 'soldier', 'status', 'was', 'shown', 'be', 'willing', 'stand', 'up', 'bullies', 'even', 'knowing', 'was', 'going', 'get', 'hurt', 'IMO', 'traits', 'combined', 'make', 'true', 'hero']",N/A
