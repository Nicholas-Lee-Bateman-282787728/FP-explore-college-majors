I knew just how he felt. Being gay is so difficult, there are just so many things involved with it that it just gets exhausting really fast.  But you have to just push forward, because hiding it and denying it is even more difficult.NE Way -this is not Oprah-This movie is about an upper middle class family, all of the children are grown and they all are facing their individual issues.  Just when you think that all the drama is over, you hit the climax, the most dramatic revelation about the youngest of the adult children. The Golden Boy, Matt.  It made me cry, but I think it was so emotional for me because it touched a very real and personal place for me.Jim Carey is serious in this movie, and he is really good at it.  When he isnt acting like a nut, you really get to see that he is actually a VERY talented dramatic actor.  William McNamara, yes one of those gorgeous McNamara's is in this movie, along side ""Becky"" from the show ""Full House"" and that one lady who was the evil receptionist in that movie ""Dont Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead"".

829559,AP0DQSDFSLP4P,B0002B15WO,"Christopher M. MacNeil ""Chris M""","[5, 5]","Actor Ken Olin tackled directing duties in this 1992 gem of a television movie that elvates family dynfunctionalim to an art form. So tense and raw are the emotions that we actually feel some of the family members are enduring just that - ""time"" in their own home. The plot is cemented on the pending marriage of the youngest son (William McNamara) to ""Full House"" alumni Lori Laughlin. But the nupitals hit the skids when the bride-to-be stumbles onto her fiance's ""secret:"" he's gay, and his upcoming marriage is intended as little more than an obligation to his parents (""Hill Street Blues"" veteran James Sikking and the late Bibi Beesch). Exit the potential bride, although she keeps her ex-fiance's ""secret"" to herself. The disclosure doesn't come until the closeted son drives his car off a road in a suicide attempt and, when the beans are spilled about why the marriage bit the dust and why the son crashed, we learn of this upper middle class family's other dysfunctions: one emotionally shattered and alcoholic son (Jim Carry, in a moving and all-too-rare dramatic performance) who, as one line goes, ""drinks himself into oblivion every night,"" and another son crushed by his wife's secret abortion, done supposedly because the young married's can't ""afford"" a child. As the parents of a suicidal closeted gay son, another one whose life is going from one drunk to the next night's drunk, and another son whose sense of worth is ravaged, Sikking's character as the father makes us believe the man's gone through life with blinders. Once they're removed, though, Dad makes a valiant effort to begin a fragile healing process. As Mom, however, the late Ms. Beesch makes Mary Tyler Moore's emotionally void mother in ""Ordinary People"" look like Mother of the Year. We get the sense of this mother as being the warden of the family lockup on Maple Drive, and her hardest pain here is the social embarrassment her son's called-off marriage causes. We get the feeling that she is less a mother and showcases her children as examples of her own imagined achievements. In the end, unlike ""Ordinary People,"" if comparisons are fair, we get no sense of relief for the troubled sons such as was given for the fragile one (Timothy Hutton) of ""Ordinary People."" We do get a sense of hope, however, that the gay son on Maple Drive might come to some validation with his father's acceptance. No such love from the mother, however. An important social theme unfortunately goes almost unnoted in this film, however: the very real tragedy of young people killing themselves because they're gay (or at least aren't accepted because they're gay). ""Doing Time ..."" is a worthy project of its type, and it warrants serious viewing. It's so emotionally churning that, by film's end, we actually feel we've finished doing time and have been paroled.",4,"Aptly titled, or ""Ordinary People"" with a twist",1147478400,"05 13, 2006",2006,2835,"['Actor', 'Ken', 'Olin', 'tackled', 'directing', 'duties', '1992', 'gem', 'television', 'movie', 'family', 'dynfunctionalim', 'art', 'form', 'tense', 'raw', 'are', 'emotions', 'actually', 'feel', 'family', 'members', 'are', 'enduring', 'just', 'time', 'own', 'home', 'plot', 'cemented', 'pending', 'marriage', 'youngest', 'son', 'William', 'McNamara', 'Full', 'House', 'Lori', 'Laughlin', 'nupitals', 'hit', 'skids', 'when', 'bride-to-be', 'stumbles', 'fiance', 'secret', 'gay', 'upcoming', 'marriage', 'intended', 'little', 'more', 'obligation', 'parents', 'Hill', 'Street', 'Blues', 'veteran', 'James', 'Sikking', 'late', 'Bibi', 'Beesch', 'Exit', 'potential', 'bride', 'ex-fiance', 'secret', 'herself', 'disclosure', ""n't"", 'come', 'closeted', 'son', 'car', 'road', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'when', 'beans', 'are', 'spilled', 'why', 'marriage', 'bit', 'dust', 'why', 'son', 'crashed', 'learn', 'upper', 'middle', 'class', 'family', 'other', 'dysfunctions', 'one', 'emotionally', 'shattered', 'alcoholic', 'son', 'Jim', 'Carry', 'moving', 'all-too-rare', 'dramatic', 'performance', 'who', 'one', 'line', 'drinks', 'oblivion', 'night', 'son', 'crushed', 'wife', 'secret', 'abortion', 'done', 'supposedly', 'young', 'married', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'child', 'parents', 'suicidal', 'closeted', 'gay', 'son', 'one', 'life', 'going', 'one', 'drunk', 'next', 'night', 'drunk', 'son', 'sense', 'worth', 'ravaged', 'Sikking', 'character', 'father', 'believe', 'man', 'gone', 'life', 'blinders', ""'re"", 'removed', 'Dad', 'valiant', 'effort', 'begin', 'fragile', 'healing', 'process', 'Mom', 'however', 'late', 'Ms.', 'Beesch', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'emotionally', 'void', 'mother', 'Ordinary', 'People', 'look', 'Mother', 'Year', 'get', 'sense', 'mother', 'being', 'warden', 'family', 'lockup', 'Maple', 'Drive', 'hardest', 'pain', 'here', 'social', 'embarrassment', 'son', 'called-off', 'marriage', 'causes', 'get', 'feeling', 'less', 'mother', 'children', 'examples', 'own', 'imagined', 'achievements', 'end', 'Ordinary', 'People', 'comparisons', 'are', 'fair', 'get', 'sense', 'relief', 'troubled', 'sons', 'such', 'was', 'given', 'fragile', 'one', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'Ordinary', 'People', 'do', 'get', 'sense', 'hope', 'however', 'gay', 'son', 'Maple', 'Drive', 'might', 'come', 'validation', 'father', 'acceptance', 'such', 'love', 'mother', 'however', 'important', 'social', 'theme', 'unfortunately', 'almost', 'unnoted', 'film', 'however', 'very', 'real', 'tragedy', 'young', 'people', 'killing', ""'re"", 'gay', 'least', 'are', ""n't"", 'accepted', ""'re"", 'gay', 'Doing', 'Time', 'worthy', 'project', 'type', 'warrants', 'serious', 'viewing', 'so', 'emotionally', 'churning', 'film', 'end', 'actually', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'finished', 'doing', 'time', 'have', 'been', 'paroled']",N/A

829563,A14JEURPY1CXZB,B0002B15WO,James D. Leverton,"[161, 169]","Fox DVD will undoubtedly showcase Jim Carrey for his supporting performance in ""Doing Time on Maple Drive,"" a stellar cable TV movie from 1992, but buyer beware:  his is a straight, supporting dramatic performance.  He is very good, but the real shining star of this small Ken Olin-directed gem is the talented William McNamara, who is unforgettable as the ""good"" son in a seemingly perfect, but actually dysfunctional, family led by James B. Sikking and Bebe Besch.  ""Chicago Hope""'s Jayne Brook rounds out the cast as a daughter who evidently married beneath her status and joins alcoholic older brother Carrey as the profound disappointments in a family who has laid all its future hopes and dreams on its children.  Apparently, it's up to youngest son McNamara to rise above the rubble his siblings have made of their lives and carry on the family's grand promise.  Unfortunately, he has a secret that will come crashing down on everyone involved.When the story opens, McNamara is bringing fiance Lori Loughlin home to meet the family.  And it's a joyous homecoming, but it's clear something is wrong with the relationship.  Then the unthinkable happens and Loughlin discovers McNamara's secret:  he is gay and has left a long-term boyfriend to marry her simply to please his parents, who supposedly don't know the truth.  Then she leaves and he is left to explain to his family why his bride has abandoned him and why he may very well be their biggest disappointment of all.The great thing about ""Doing Time on Maple Drive"" is how honest it is, and how refreshingly free of melodrama the writers and director Olin have made it.  McNamara's secret is revealed slowly, and when the family finally finds out about it, their reactions are honest and true.  That the mother takes it hardest of all is a refreshing twist, and Sikking's father has a final heart-to-heart with his son which is beautiful, yet heartbreaking, to behold.  What is refreshing is that the film isn't about homosexuality as much as it is about family dynamics and how important it is for parents not to base too much of their hopes and dreams on their children.  The ironic thing is that McNamara will undoubtedly be a success in life, and should be a source of undying pride for his parents, but because of his sexuality he will always be the family's embarassing secret.The performances in ""Doing Time on Maple Drive"" are universally excellent, with McNamara and Sikking the standouts.  Besch is also pitch-perfect as a mother who is loving on the outside, but as cold-hearted and unforgiving on the inside as was Mary Tyler Moore in ""Ordinary People.""  Brook and Loughlin offer solid support, but Carrey is a revelation, especially those who missed his stellar dramatic work in ""Man on the Moon"" and ""Eternal Sunshine.""  Made just before ""Ace Ventura"" made him a comedic superstar, his alcoholic son is tender and achingly true.  And director Ken Olin handles everything with appropriate restraint and a total lack of exploitation.""Doing Time on Maple Drive"" is a terrific TV movie and a welcome edition to DVD.  Don't let the subject matter scare you off.  It is respectfully and tastefully handled, and for once serves a more universal truth than simply preaching to the choir about homosexual rights.  After one viewing, you may ask yourself the same question I have for years:  Why is William McNamara not a major star?  You may be as baffled as me.  *****(out of *****)",5,Stellar TV movie with great cast,1092268800,"08 12, 2004",2004,3451,"['Fox', 'DVD', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'showcase', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'supporting', 'performance', 'Doing', 'Time', 'Maple', 'Drive', 'stellar', 'cable', 'TV', 'movie', '1992', 'buyer', 'beware', 'straight', 'supporting', 'dramatic', 'performance', 'very', 'good', 'real', 'shining', 'star', 'small', 'Ken', 'Olin-directed', 'gem', 'talented', 'William', 'McNamara', 'who', 'unforgettable', 'good', 'son', 'seemingly', 'perfect', 'actually', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'led', 'James', 'B.', 'Sikking', 'Bebe', 'Besch', 'Chicago', 'Hope', 'Jayne', 'Brook', 'out', 'cast', 'daughter', 'who', 'evidently', 'married', 'status', 'alcoholic', 'older', 'brother', 'Carrey', 'profound', 'disappointments', 'family', 'who', 'laid', 'future', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'children', 'Apparently', 'up', 'youngest', 'son', 'McNamara', 'rise', 'rubble', 'siblings', 'have', 'made', 'lives', 'carry', 'family', 'grand', 'promise', 'Unfortunately', 'secret', 'will', 'come', 'crashing', 'down', 'everyone', 'involved.When', 'story', 'McNamara', 'bringing', 'fiance', 'Lori', 'Loughlin', 'home', 'meet', 'family', 'joyous', 'homecoming', 'clear', 'something', 'wrong', 'relationship', 'Then', 'unthinkable', 'happens', 'Loughlin', 'McNamara', 'secret', 'gay', 'left', 'long-term', 'boyfriend', 'marry', 'simply', 'please', 'parents', 'who', 'supposedly', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'truth', 'Then', 'left', 'explain', 'family', 'why', 'bride', 'abandoned', 'why', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'biggest', 'disappointment', 'all.The', 'great', 'thing', 'Doing', 'Time', 'Maple', 'Drive', 'how', 'honest', 'how', 'refreshingly', 'free', 'melodrama', 'writers', 'director', 'Olin', 'have', 'made', 'McNamara', 'secret', 'revealed', 'slowly', 'when', 'family', 'finally', 'out', 'reactions', 'are', 'honest', 'true', 'mother', 'hardest', 'refreshing', 'twist', 'Sikking', 'father', 'final', 'heart-to-heart', 'son', 'beautiful', 'yet', 'heartbreaking', 'behold', 'What', 'refreshing', 'film', ""n't"", 'about', 'homosexuality', 'as', 'much', 'family', 'dynamics', 'how', 'important', 'parents', 'not', 'base', 'too', 'much', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'children', 'ironic', 'thing', 'McNamara', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'be', 'success', 'life', 'should', 'be', 'source', 'undying', 'pride', 'parents', 'sexuality', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'family', 'embarassing', 'secret.The', 'performances', 'Doing', 'Time', 'Maple', 'Drive', 'are', 'universally', 'excellent', 'McNamara', 'Sikking', 'standouts', 'Besch', 'also', 'pitch-perfect', 'mother', 'who', 'loving', 'outside', 'cold-hearted', 'unforgiving', 'inside', 'was', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Ordinary', 'People', 'Brook', 'Loughlin', 'offer', 'solid', 'support', 'Carrey', 'revelation', 'especially', 'who', 'missed', 'stellar', 'dramatic', 'work', 'Man', 'Moon', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Made', 'just', 'Ace', 'Ventura', 'made', 'comedic', 'superstar', 'alcoholic', 'son', 'tender', 'achingly', 'true', 'director', 'Ken', 'Olin', 'everything', 'appropriate', 'restraint', 'total', 'lack', 'exploitation', 'Doing', 'Time', 'Maple', 'Drive', 'terrific', 'TV', 'movie', 'welcome', 'edition', 'DVD', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'subject', 'matter', 'scare', 'off', 'respectfully', 'tastefully', 'handled', 'once', 'more', 'universal', 'truth', 'simply', 'preaching', 'choir', 'homosexual', 'rights', 'one', 'viewing', 'may', 'ask', 'same', 'question', 'have', 'years', 'Why', 'William', 'McNamara', 'not', 'major', 'star', 'may', 'be', 'as', 'baffled', '*****', '*****']",N/A

Its not so much that the protagonists were not particularly engaging, but that Jim Carey in a minor role - an actor whose work I hadn't much liked till now - showed a real depth of interpretation that was well beyond anything achieved by any of the other actors.I think the ground covered by this movie has been covered much more competently by other movies such as Todd Haynes' beautifully filmed Far From Heaven [perfect American family disrupted by husband's homosexuality & progressive wife's relationship with her gardener in a less tolerant age] and the well scripted and acted French film Just a Question of Love [self-oppression and parent's difficulty in accepting their gay son - don't be put off by the schmaltzy title.]In comparison, Doing Time on Maple Drive is inoffensive but pedestrian.",3,Inoffensive  but uninspired,1140912000,"02 26, 2006",2006,1190,"['Not', 'being', 'fond', 'form', 'jingoism', 'sight', 'American', 'flag', 'very', 'first', 'frame', 'film', 'had', 'reaching', 'Off', 'button', 'However', 'persevered', 'found', 'be', 'competent', 'not', 'particularly', 'inspiring', 'film', 'couple', 'view', 'what', 'all-American', 'family', 'should', 'be', 'script', 'functional', 'production', 'values', 'OK', 'acting', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'uneven', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'protagonists', 'were', 'not', 'particularly', 'engaging', 'Jim', 'Carey', 'minor', 'role', 'actor', 'work', 'had', ""n't"", 'much', 'liked', 'till', 'now', 'showed', 'real', 'depth', 'interpretation', 'was', 'well', 'anything', 'achieved', 'other', 'actors.I', 'think', 'ground', 'covered', 'movie', 'been', 'covered', 'much', 'more', 'competently', 'other', 'movies', 'such', 'Todd', 'Haynes', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'Far', 'From', 'Heaven', '[', 'perfect', 'American', 'family', 'disrupted', 'husband', 'homosexuality', 'progressive', 'wife', 'relationship', 'gardener', 'less', 'tolerant', 'age', ']', 'well', 'scripted', 'acted', 'French', 'film', 'Just', 'Question', 'Love', '[', 'self-oppression', 'parent', 'difficulty', 'accepting', 'gay', 'son', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'put', 'off', 'schmaltzy', 'title', ']', 'comparison', 'Doing', 'Time', 'Maple', 'Drive', 'inoffensive', 'pedestrian']",N/A

Robert Redford's 1980 movie adaption catapulted it into Oscar gold, with a memorable, chilling performance by Mary Tyler Moore as Beth Jarrett, the mother who doesn't understand her son. Flash forward 12 years later, and this movie, directed by Ken Olin from 'Thirtysomething' is as fine as a followup to 'Ordinary People' as you will find. James B. Sikking and the late Bibi Besch play an ordinary couple with three children, one on the verge of getting married, one married, and one struggling with a drinking problem. They have come together for the wedding of their youngest son, played by William MacNamara, who hides a secret from his fiancee, played by Lori Loughlin. Jayne Brook is the daughter who is struggling to keep her life afloat with her husband, who wants her to have a baby. And Tim, played by Jim Carrey (yes, THE Jim Carrey), can't seem to please his father, no matter what he does. All of the actors are uniformly excellent, but the standout is Jim Carrey. While you may know him as a brilliant comic actor, his portrayal as Tim will break your heart. He has a range that goes from anger, to sadness, to empathy, and you feel for him in every scene. He should have, in my opinion won an Emmy for his role. This is one movie you must not miss, and definitely add to your collection.

It is an excellent tool to educate narrow minds and bring some understanding to, not just the gay issue but also to parents and the expectations they put on thier children as well as what those expectations can do to the children.

829571,A16D5XWFM3NRP4,B0002B15WO,"Tim E. Jay ""wainwright77""","[55, 61]","In this film we have: The alcoholic son; the homosexual son who is trying to be heterosexual to please himself and his family; the overlooked daughter and her husband with marital issues; the ultra conservative, emotionally unavailable father who is extremely hard on his children; and the mother who cares WAY too much what other people think and would rather hide behind a lie she has known for quite sometime. Not to mention the poor girl who thinks her fiance is straight, has to face her own pain in finding otherwise.For a TV movie, this film is great. This is about a dysfunctional family. It is not only a ""coming out"" story, but also about an alcoholic son portrayed by Jim Carrey, who, along with the daughter's husband, seem to be the only people who can see how screwed up the family really is. The gay son, who on this occasion, brings home his new fiance, is forced to come out of the closet. He is so used to trying to put a pretty face on everything and not showing things for what they really are...which he seems to get from his parents. Basically, all at one time the s--t hits the fan, so to speak. It is definitely not an uplifting film, but shows how a dyfunctional family who hides their secrets and refuse to come to terms with their problems, will eventually fall apart and have to find a way to rebuild again, on different terms, through unconditional love and support. This is a wonderful film to show teenage children the dangers of alcoholism, and how important it is to love and support your children unconditionally regardless of their issues and sexual orientation. It can show the catastrophic results that can and usually will occur when people don't face their problems. What should parents care more about, their family image or their children? This would be great to show Jr. High, High School, and College students. I saw it when I was in high school and it helped me tremendously. I then showed it to a friend in college struggling with his sexuality and his religious parents who would not accept him. He came to terms with it as did his parents. They now accept him for who he is. Just goes to show how facing your problems and trying to understand an issue, will only help you and your loved ones in the future.",5,Wonderful film finally available...,1088640000,"07 1, 2004",2004,2253,"['film', 'have', 'alcoholic', 'son', 'homosexual', 'son', 'who', 'trying', 'be', 'heterosexual', 'please', 'family', 'overlooked', 'daughter', 'husband', 'marital', 'issues', 'ultra', 'conservative', 'emotionally', 'unavailable', 'father', 'who', 'extremely', 'hard', 'children', 'mother', 'who', 'WAY', 'too', 'much', 'what', 'other', 'people', 'think', 'would', 'rather', 'hide', 'lie', 'known', 'quite', 'sometime', 'Not', 'mention', 'poor', 'girl', 'who', 'fiance', 'straight', 'face', 'own', 'pain', 'finding', 'otherwise.For', 'TV', 'movie', 'film', 'great', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'not', 'only', 'coming', 'out', 'story', 'also', 'alcoholic', 'son', 'portrayed', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'who', 'daughter', 'husband', 'seem', 'be', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'screwed', 'up', 'family', 'really', 'gay', 'son', 'who', 'occasion', 'home', 'new', 'fiance', 'forced', 'come', 'closet', 'so', 'used', 'trying', 'put', 'pretty', 'face', 'everything', 'not', 'showing', 'things', 'what', 'really', 'are', 'get', 'parents', 'Basically', 'one', 'time', 's', 't', 'fan', 'so', 'speak', 'definitely', 'not', 'uplifting', 'film', 'how', 'dyfunctional', 'family', 'who', 'secrets', 'refuse', 'come', 'terms', 'problems', 'will', 'eventually', 'fall', 'apart', 'have', 'find', 'way', 'rebuild', 'again', 'different', 'terms', 'unconditional', 'love', 'support', 'wonderful', 'film', 'show', 'teenage', 'children', 'dangers', 'alcoholism', 'how', 'important', 'love', 'support', 'children', 'unconditionally', 'regardless', 'issues', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'can', 'show', 'catastrophic', 'results', 'can', 'usually', 'will', 'occur', 'when', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'face', 'problems', 'What', 'should', 'parents', 'care', 'more', 'family', 'image', 'children', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'show', 'Jr.', 'High', 'High', 'School', 'College', 'students', 'saw', 'when', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'helped', 'tremendously', 'then', 'showed', 'friend', 'college', 'struggling', 'sexuality', 'religious', 'parents', 'who', 'would', 'not', 'accept', 'came', 'terms', 'did', 'parents', 'now', 'accept', 'who', 'Just', 'show', 'how', 'facing', 'problems', 'trying', 'understand', 'issue', 'will', 'only', 'help', 'loved', 'ones', 'future']",N/A

I recall Jim carrey's performance being more prominent that it actually is. His scenes and dialogue are quite short, but are impressive. If you have only seen him in his funny roles, you will be interested to see him here in a more dramatic role.  William McNamara (from COPYCAT) is the main focus of the film as the favourite son who has a secret.The film suffers from feeling a tad dated, but the impressive cast make up for it.  This made for TV film was directed by Ken Olin (star of THIRTYSOMETHING) and looks at a dysfunctional family.  It impressed me how the casting agent picked actors to play the siblings who actually looked like they could be brothers and sisters.DVD SUMMARY - The film was shot originally on videotape and it shows through the soft image presented on DVD.

829574,A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ,B0002B15WO,"Z. Freeman ""Zach""","[1, 1]","This film probably would not get 5 stars from me if it was released in the theatre, but for a made for tv movie, from 15 years ago, Doing Time on Maple Drive is hard to beat. The story is intense, realistic, and relevant. The acting is superb. And the directing and cinematography make it much more than another churned out tv drama.The story centers around a family, that through the mother's and father's influence, seeks to display itself as perfect all the time. As the film begins with the youngest brother coming home with his new bride-to-be, the audience is slowly let in on the secret that maybe that's not what's really happening in this family.Since I didn't know any of the plot when I watched it, I'd rather not reveal anything that would take away from the slow and honest way that the filmmakers chose to reveal the secrets of each character. Suffice it to say that this is a film about family honesty and pressure.Jim Carrey is the name and face they put on this film, and because of his box office success and fanbase, how can you blame them, but he's really just a supporting character here, although he does turn in a great performance. And so does everyone else in the cast. Every scene is surprising in its honesty and emotional depth.If you're checking this out because you're a Jim Carrey fan, like I did, then it's definitely worth it. If you just like made for tv dramas from the 90's then I think you'd be hard pressed to find a better one.There's not many extras on the DVD. Just a tv spot that must have been reworked from the original, because it only mentions Jim Carrey as the star, and in 1992, I don't think that would have brought many people to their tv set.",5,Surprisingly heartfelt family drama,1173225600,"03 7, 2007",2007,1693,"['film', 'probably', 'would', 'not', 'get', '5', 'stars', 'was', 'released', 'theatre', 'made', 'tv', 'movie', '15', 'years', 'ago', 'Doing', 'Time', 'Maple', 'Drive', 'hard', 'beat', 'story', 'intense', 'realistic', 'relevant', 'acting', 'superb', 'directing', 'cinematography', 'make', 'much', 'more', 'churned', 'out', 'tv', 'drama.The', 'story', 'centers', 'family', 'mother', 'father', 'influence', 'display', 'perfect', 'time', 'film', 'youngest', 'brother', 'coming', 'home', 'new', 'bride-to-be', 'audience', 'slowly', 'let', 'secret', 'not', 'what', 'really', 'happening', 'family.Since', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'plot', 'when', 'watched', ""'d"", 'rather', 'not', 'reveal', 'anything', 'would', 'take', 'away', 'slow', 'honest', 'way', 'filmmakers', 'chose', 'reveal', 'secrets', 'character', 'Suffice', 'say', 'film', 'family', 'honesty', 'pressure.Jim', 'Carrey', 'name', 'face', 'put', 'film', 'box', 'office', 'success', 'fanbase', 'how', 'can', 'blame', 'really', 'just', 'supporting', 'character', 'here', 'turn', 'great', 'performance', 'so', 'everyone', 'else', 'cast', 'scene', 'surprising', 'honesty', 'emotional', 'depth.If', ""'re"", 'checking', 'out', ""'re"", 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'fan', 'did', 'then', 'definitely', 'worth', 'just', 'made', 'tv', 'dramas', '90', 'then', 'think', ""'d"", 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'find', 'better', 'not', 'many', 'extras', 'DVD', 'Just', 'tv', 'spot', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'reworked', 'original', 'only', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'star', '1992', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'have', 'brought', 'many', 'people', 'tv', 'set']",N/A
