1537928,AQGLLL5A6PQQC,B007TJKXV6,Bill L. Matthews,"[0, 0]","I consider Alfie Boe one of the five best performers in musical theatre. And this DVD showcases his talents perfectly. It's difficult to bring a concert to DVD and still keep the ""concert"" feeling, but this one manages to do that. And the songs Alfie chose for this concert are all worthy of his fine talent. Amazon offers it at a reasonable price. This is an excellent addition to my film library. I sort of feel we have kidnapped Alfie so he can be viewed at any time. If the Blackpool coppers are looking for him, this would be a good starting point.",5,Alfie Live And Terrific,1348185600,"09 21, 2012",2012,553,"['consider', 'Alfie', 'Boe', 'one', 'five', 'best', 'performers', 'musical', 'theatre', 'DVD', 'talents', 'perfectly', 'difficult', 'bring', 'concert', 'DVD', 'still', 'keep', 'concert', 'feeling', 'one', 'do', 'songs', 'Alfie', 'chose', 'concert', 'are', 'worthy', 'fine', 'talent', 'Amazon', 'reasonable', 'price', 'excellent', 'addition', 'film', 'library', 'sort', 'feel', 'have', 'kidnapped', 'Alfie', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'time', 'Blackpool', 'coppers', 'are', 'looking', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'starting', 'point']",N/A

1537930,A328S9RN3U5M68,B007TJKXV6,Grady Harp,"[24, 27]","There could be no better accompaniment for British operatic sensation Alfie Boe fans on this day of release of his newest CD ALFIE  that this DVD the captures a  live stage performance from the The Bring Him Home Tour, recorded last fall at London's Royal Festival Hall. It is a typical wild audience reception for this terrific stage personality and vocal artist.  Though there is nothing much new here material wise - Boe still favors his signature songs from 'Les Mis&eacute;rables' and also reprises his excerpts form 'Blood Brothers' and 'West Side Story' - but there are plenty of numbers  to add a special celebratory feeling to this life performance.  He brings on stage Matt Lucas, composer Claude Michel Schonberg of 'Les Mis&eacute;rables' fame, Melanie C from the Spice Girls an Tom Fletcher from McFly.  It is all backed by spectacular lighting and superimposed closeups of Boe with a background of the vast distance spots from within the theater. The DVD captures the moment, nothing more or less, and that seems enough.

1537935,A1P89WQP4WLH97,B007TJKXV6,Roseann S.,"[1, 1]",Alfie is an incredible singer with a masterful voice.  I knew that from the Les Mis 25th anniversary concert but with this solo concert he demonstrates his other talents.  He has a delightful sense of humor that is peppered through the song selections which vary widely from opera to easy listening and he even plays the drums.

Well I spell it out below but can sum it up in four words.  TOO MANY GUEST SINGERS.Great:  Alfie, of course.  The man has the voice of an angel.  His ""Bring Him Home"" always brings me to tears.  Also great was Matt Lucas.  As a fan of their ""kitchen concerts"" I wish there was more of Matt.  An appearance by Claude Michel Shoenberg (Not sure of the spelling) was a wonderful gesture.Good:  Alfie's joking with the orchestra was funny, especially when the oboe player messed up.  Poor girl got such abuse from Alfie.  Many of his ""jokes"" were not really funny, or I just don't get British humor.  He seemed nervous at the start, perhaps this should have been filmed at a later concert, but he warmed up as the show went on.Fair:  The little girl who sang was so good and very cute, but we could have done without her.Poor:  Too many guests.  Tom McFly/Fletcher, not sure of his name Alfie calls him both, was okay on the Beatles song but poor on ""Empty Chairs at Empty Tables""Terrible:  Talk about too many guests, who ever told Mel C she could sing.  She was bad on the first song and absolutely destroyed ""Come What May.""  It's one of my favorite songs and I find myself fast forwarding through it at this concert.  Considering Laura Wright was at the concert, I would much rather have heard her.  She can sing.Seeing Alfie for myself for the first time in October.  Hoping for lots of Alfie, with no special guests who can't sing.On a side note, why did we have to wait months for this release after the UK release.
