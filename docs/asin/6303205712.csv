Tina Turner's dynamic presence here is a new proof that she is THE Soul  Queen. Just incredible.  What disappointed me was the way they edit the tape.  At the each end of the song, the vido distributer inserted unnecessary trivia quiz -- like, who wrote the song &quot;Prond Mary&quot; -- and while the quiz appears on your TV screen, interrupting the picture of the show, we cannot see the performance of those great artists, for whom we paid money! Another complaint is that the response of the audience; it is unbelievable that they can sit before Tina without moving an inch, though it may be because it was shot long  time ago and the way people reacted to the music was different.  But...remember the heated teens seen in videos like &quot;Shindig&quot;? Or &quot;Hard Day's Night&quot;? Why can they be so quiet, is another  thing that sticks to my mind, even though the performances themselves are perfect.  And the last thing I complain about is  that the video has no data about the place, date, or even year about  the show you see.  That is also a trivial thing, but much important than those which interrupt our viewing, isn't it?  So, overall satisfactory, but those who edited the original tape  should have left it intact.",4,"Wonderful Songs, Bad Editing",996364800,"07 29, 2001",2001,1335,"['review', 'may', 'sound', 'little', 'bit', 'harsh', 'perfomance', 'simply', 'great', 'Tina', 'Turner', 'dynamic', 'presence', 'here', 'new', 'proof', 'THE', 'Soul', 'Queen', 'Just', 'incredible', 'What', 'disappointed', 'was', 'way', 'edit', 'tape', 'end', 'song', 'vido', 'distributer', 'inserted', 'unnecessary', 'trivia', 'quiz', 'who', 'wrote', 'song', 'quot', 'Prond', 'Mary', 'quot', 'quiz', 'TV', 'screen', 'interrupting', 'picture', 'show', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'performance', 'great', 'artists', 'whom', 'paid', 'money', 'complaint', 'response', 'audience', 'unbelievable', 'can', 'sit', 'Tina', 'moving', 'inch', 'may', 'be', 'was', 'shot', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'way', 'people', 'reacted', 'music', 'was', 'different', 'remember', 'heated', 'teens', 'seen', 'videos', 'quot', 'Shindig', 'quot', 'quot', 'Hard', 'Day', 'Night', 'quot', 'Why', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'quiet', 'thing', 'mind', 'even', 'performances', 'are', 'perfect', 'last', 'thing', 'complain', 'video', 'data', 'place', 'date', 'even', 'year', 'show', 'see', 'also', 'trivial', 'thing', 'much', 'important', 'interrupt', 'viewing', ""n't"", 'So', 'overall', 'satisfactory', 'who', 'edited', 'original', 'tape', 'should', 'have', 'left', 'intact']",N/A
