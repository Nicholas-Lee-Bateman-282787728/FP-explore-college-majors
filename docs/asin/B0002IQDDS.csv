The discussion focus largely on their personal lives during the making of the original series giving one an insight into how Star Trek affected their relationship with their wives, children, writers, and co-stars.  One really gets a sense of what it must have been like to have been involved in a TV series during the late fifties through the sixties.There are some  poignant moments when the two stars talk about alchohol/cigarette addictions, divorce, death of family members etc.  These heartfelt moments are interspersed with Shatner's infectious sense of humour which makes this documentary throughly balanced yet enjoyable.Furthermore, the interviews are supplemented with rare family photos which places these iconic actors refreshingly ""outside"" the Star Trek context which makes the Shatner and Nimoy more personable and ultimately more ""real"" as people.",5,Poignant intimate discussion about their personal lives during the making of the Original Series,1143936000,"04 2, 2006",2006,1001,"['intimate', 'conversation', 'William', 'Shatner', 'Leonard', 'Nimoy', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Leonard', 'Nimoy', 'beautiful', 'house', 'garden', 'discussion', 'focus', 'largely', 'personal', 'lives', 'making', 'original', 'series', 'giving', 'one', 'insight', 'how', 'Star', 'Trek', 'affected', 'relationship', 'wives', 'children', 'writers', 'co-stars', 'One', 'really', 'sense', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'have', 'been', 'involved', 'TV', 'series', 'late', 'fifties', 'sixties.There', 'are', 'poignant', 'moments', 'when', 'two', 'stars', 'talk', 'alchohol/cigarette', 'addictions', 'divorce', 'death', 'family', 'members', 'etc', 'heartfelt', 'moments', 'are', 'interspersed', 'Shatner', 'infectious', 'sense', 'humour', 'documentary', 'throughly', 'balanced', 'yet', 'enjoyable.Furthermore', 'interviews', 'are', 'supplemented', 'rare', 'family', 'photos', 'iconic', 'actors', 'refreshingly', 'outside', 'Star', 'Trek', 'context', 'Shatner', 'Nimoy', 'more', 'personable', 'ultimately', 'more', 'real', 'people']",N/A
835560,A28B47KE7UJDZH,B0002IQDDS,e1x56u$*w#,"[2, 2]","I had no idea what this was when it popped up in my Amazon recommendations.  I had never heard of it anywhere before.  I was afraid it was some kind of low-budget and poor quality profile cobbled together from faded and scratchy archive footage by some no-name outfit out to make a quick buck.  There are many of those kinds of unauthorized and completely worthless so-called documentaries being sold these days on the topic of various musical stars and groups.But man was I wrong!  This disc here is the real deal.  An in-depth interview made by Shatner and Nimoy themselves especially for the fans.  This is one of those rare purchases that far, far exceeded my wildest expectations and I feel was worth far more than its modest purchase price.In fact just last year I paid mega-bucks to see Shatner and Nimoy in person at a convention, and while it was wonderful to actually be in their illustrious presence, I have to say the long, probing and detailed conversation contained on this disc was actually far more satisfying than the amusing but limited banter they served up for the fans at the con.The two take turns interviewing each other and discussing their lives, not skirting difficult issues like alcoholism, marriage break-ups and even their sometimes strained relationship with other Star Trek cast members.  It seems that realizing their mortality (both actors are now in their 70s), they have made this as a kind of legacy to set the record straight on many things.I really loved the unhurried pace and pensive tone of the interview, which allowed for a very deep discussion which I found more satisfying than any interview with them I had ever seen before.  This was truly the kind of interview with them I had always wanted to see!And best of all, when the interview is over, we are taken right inside Leonard Nimoy's house and you even get to see where he keeps his Spock ears!If you are not a Star Trek fan, this disc will probably mean nothing to you.  But to the original series Star Trek fan, in my opinion this disc is absolutely priceless and I give it my highest recommendation possible.  By all means get this!!

On this DVD, Leonard and Bill interview each other and ask sometimes hard questions and at other times make comments that have them rolling in laughter, and I laugh along with them. These two care about each other a lot and you can't help but walk away feeling good after watching the two get along so well. The entire interview is something that all fans of Star Trek need and would like to hear. They address feelings on death, life during and after Trek, and their personal lives besides Trek, whether they be good or bad memories. They also give a small tour of Leonard's house, which is where this film was made. Another cool thing about the interview is that it shows pictures of the two from the past, such as Nimoy getting his Spock make up on, while they are talking. If you love the original series, then you do need this DVD. I was hanging on every word the two said to each other, and it only being around 75 minutes long, I felt like it ended too soon and could have went on for much longer and wouldn't have lost it's touch.",5,Worth Buying!,1174521600,"03 22, 2007",2007,1183,"['William', 'Shatner', 'Leonard', 'Nimoy', 'are', 'closest', 'two', 'friends', 'can', 'be', 'really', 'expressed', 'great', 'way', 'interview/documentary', 'DVD', 'Leonard', 'Bill', 'interview', 'other', 'ask', 'sometimes', 'hard', 'questions', 'other', 'times', 'make', 'comments', 'have', 'rolling', 'laughter', 'laugh', 'along', 'two', 'care', 'other', 'lot', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'walk', 'away', 'feeling', 'good', 'watching', 'two', 'get', 'so', 'well', 'entire', 'interview', 'something', 'fans', 'Star', 'Trek', 'need', 'would', 'like', 'hear', 'address', 'feelings', 'death', 'life', 'Trek', 'personal', 'lives', 'Trek', 'be', 'good', 'bad', 'memories', 'also', 'give', 'small', 'tour', 'Leonard', 'house', 'where', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'cool', 'thing', 'interview', 'pictures', 'two', 'past', 'such', 'Nimoy', 'getting', 'Spock', 'make', 'up', 'are', 'talking', 'love', 'original', 'series', 'then', 'do', 'need', 'DVD', 'was', 'hanging', 'word', 'two', 'said', 'other', 'only', 'being', '75', 'minutes', 'long', 'felt', 'ended', 'too', 'soon', 'could', 'have', 'went', 'much', 'longer', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'lost', 'touch']",N/A
835562,A3VREOCVARPZRM,B0002IQDDS,Greatwood,"[13, 14]","""Mind Meld"" is a fascinating glimpse into the lives of two iconic actors who starred in the immensely popular Star Trek!  For those of us who grew up watching Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock this is a must see!  The two actors meet at Leonard Nimoy's home and share their memories in his beautiful backyard..You immediately sense a bond between the two that you sense as a deep and meaningful friendship..sort of a brotherly love if you will..Shatner sort of starts off interviewing Nimoy but contributes quite a bit of his own personal reflections and memories..One of highlights of this program is how Shatner deals with the animosity and resentment of his former castmates..It's obvious that he is quite hurt by some of the criticisms but he creates a veneer of rationalizations to ""protect"" himself...a defense mechanism if you will...But to Shatner's credit..he was the ""star"" of the show and his boundless energy and crafting of his character was most likely going to alienate others..as a comparison, we always heard stories of Barbara Streisand's tantrums on movie sets..but I guess in a sense, that's what drove these artists and made them great!  What I found odd is that Shatner stated that he felt the Star Trek conventions fueled the other actor's egos and made them feel more ""important than they were"" in his words..I'm not sure about that..after reading George Takei and Nichelle Nichol's books I felt they respected Shatner for his obvious talents as an actor but they, as an ensemble of actors, felt that their talents were not appreciated...as George Takei put it..he felt he was ""decoration"" on the bridge half of the time..In making Star Trek the classic show that it was,  the contributions of Nimoy and Shatner were immense no doubt however, there was one point during the interview where I felt that Gene Roddenberry had an immense amount of control over the show when Shatner mentioned that for the first movie..he had a idea about a scene and he and Nimoy worked it out and presented it to Robert Wise the director and Wise told them to run it by Gene..since Gene had crafted the original story..however..when it came time to do so..Shatner kind of felt intimidated...This is a wonderful interview in that it humanizes the two actors and gives you quite a bit of insight into the pressures and stresses of making a hit TV show..that it's not all glitz and glamour but a lot of hard work!  In the end you really respect these guys for their dedication to their characters and their openness about issues that they dealt with..A definite must see for diehard fans of TOS and the 6 movies!!",5,Fascinating!,1107993600,"02 10, 2005",2005,2608,"['Mind', 'Meld', 'fascinating', 'glimpse', 'lives', 'two', 'iconic', 'actors', 'who', 'starred', 'immensely', 'popular', 'Star', 'Trek', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'Captain', 'Kirk', 'Mr.', 'Spock', 'must', 'see', 'two', 'actors', 'meet', 'Leonard', 'Nimoy', 'home', 'share', 'memories', 'beautiful', 'backyard..You', 'immediately', 'sense', 'bond', 'two', 'sense', 'deep', 'meaningful', 'friendship..sort', 'brotherly', 'love', 'will..Shatner', 'sort', 'starts', 'interviewing', 'Nimoy', 'quite', 'bit', 'own', 'personal', 'reflections', 'memories..One', 'highlights', 'program', 'how', 'Shatner', 'deals', 'animosity', 'resentment', 'former', 'castmates..It', 'obvious', 'quite', 'hurt', 'criticisms', 'veneer', 'rationalizations', 'protect', 'defense', 'mechanism', 'will', 'Shatner', 'credit..he', 'was', 'star', 'show', 'boundless', 'energy', 'crafting', 'character', 'was', 'most', 'likely', 'going', 'alienate', 'others..as', 'comparison', 'always', 'heard', 'stories', 'Barbara', 'Streisand', 'tantrums', 'movie', 'sets..but', 'guess', 'sense', 'what', 'drove', 'artists', 'made', 'great', 'What', 'found', 'Shatner', 'stated', 'felt', 'Star', 'Trek', 'conventions', 'fueled', 'other', 'actor', 'egos', 'made', 'feel', 'more', 'important', 'were', 'words..I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'that..after', 'reading', 'George', 'Takei', 'Nichelle', 'Nichol', 'books', 'felt', 'respected', 'Shatner', 'obvious', 'talents', 'actor', 'ensemble', 'actors', 'felt', 'talents', 'were', 'not', 'appreciated', 'George', 'Takei', 'put', 'it..he', 'felt', 'was', 'decoration', 'bridge', 'half', 'time..In', 'making', 'Star', 'Trek', 'classic', 'show', 'was', 'contributions', 'Nimoy', 'Shatner', 'were', 'immense', 'doubt', 'however', 'was', 'one', 'point', 'interview', 'where', 'felt', 'Gene', 'Roddenberry', 'had', 'immense', 'amount', 'control', 'show', 'when', 'Shatner', 'mentioned', 'first', 'movie..he', 'had', 'idea', 'scene', 'Nimoy', 'worked', 'out', 'presented', 'Robert', 'Wise', 'director', 'Wise', 'told', 'run', 'Gene..since', 'Gene', 'had', 'crafted', 'original', 'story..however..when', 'came', 'time', 'do', 'so..Shatner', 'kind', 'felt', 'intimidated', 'wonderful', 'interview', 'two', 'actors', 'quite', 'bit', 'insight', 'pressures', 'stresses', 'making', 'hit', 'TV', 'not', 'glitz', 'glamour', 'lot', 'hard', 'work', 'end', 'really', 'respect', 'guys', 'dedication', 'characters', 'openness', 'issues', 'dealt', 'with..A', 'definite', 'must', 'see', 'diehard', 'fans', 'TOS', '6', 'movies']",N/A

I'm a major TOS (the original series) and movies 1-6 (with emphasis on 2, 4, 6) fan and like these two men from what I've seen of them in interviews. Despite Shatner's reputation as a prima donna and preening male diva, I can't help but be fond of him. Of course, I've never met him, worked with him, or been married to him.At the point on the DVD mentioned in the subject field, listen closely. In Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, the Enterprise saves the day by using equipment that ""catalogs gaseous anomalies."" One such anomaly is heard, and it clearly comes from Shatner. You can tell by his facial expression and how the ever diplomatic Nimoy plays it cool, despite the fact a gaseous anomaly is wafting his way. This is a great moment.
