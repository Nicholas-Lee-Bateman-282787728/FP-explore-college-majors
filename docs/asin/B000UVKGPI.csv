1096466,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000UVKGPI,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","With the fourth installment of the Shrek franchise hitting theaters today, I've been seeing a lot of reviews posing the question ""Is the new Shrek better than the disappointing `Shrek the Third'?""  I don't like this question.  Now, I have not seen this new Shrek film as of yet, but I feel compelled to defend the third film now since, in my opinion, it was far from disappointing.In fact, both my wife and I concluded that this was better than the second Shrek film.The plot revolves around Shrek becoming heir to the throne of Far, Far Away when Fiona's father dies.  He's not really suited for the Kingly life so he sets out on a journey to find Arthur, the only other heir to the throne, and bring him back to claim his place.  There are a few problems.  Arthur (or Artie as he is better known) is a rebellious teen who isn't really suited for Kingly duties either.  You also have the bitter Prince Charming who is determined to overtake the throne, even if that means imprisoning the recently impregnated Fiona.Well, it's not like Fiona can't take care of herself.If any of the Shrek films meandered or lost steam it was the second film.  For me, `Shrek the Third' was a step in the right direction.  Sure, it isn't as fresh or exciting as the first film, but none of them have been.  BUT, this film is funny, witty and charming.  The voice performances by the entire cast (including the newbie, Timberlake) are all top notch, and the gags here are one laugh after another.I know it's been noted, but that whole `Puss-in-Boots swapping bodies with Donkey' scene is hilarious!I don't get the hate here.  It really makes very little sense to me.  The film is entertaining from start to finish and capitalizes on everything that makes these Shrek movies so fun and engaging.

Far Far Away has become a much more populated, and much more diverse place. As well as the palace there are also run down alleys, boat docks, harbors, forests, a medieval high school, a hermits hut, several dungeons, and a rather impressive stage for Prince Charming.All the original actors are back doing their character's voices and that makes for a wonderful continuity and a great sense of family and familiarity in the show.Perhaps this isn't the best Shrek storywise, but it is a good story, with plenty of humor, one-liners, catchy songs, and absolutely gorgeous imagery.And baby ogres of course.

We're also given the delightful treat of seeing a young King Arthur be taken to Far Far Away to claim his throne.The story goes that now Shrek and Fiona are married and settled in together, they're forced to undertake royal duties for a time whilst the previous king gets better. There's a snag though, as the king dies leaving Shrek with a message. He's not the only heir to the throne and if he doesn't want the job he must track down a boy named Arthur. Shrek, Puss and Donkey set off on the journey to find Arthur leaving the women home alone. Meanwhile, Prince Charming has gathered together some of the most evil fairy tale villains to take control of Far Far Away and to get revenge on Shrek once and for all. Will the gang succeed in defeating one of their biggest challenges? Well, you'll have to watch the movie and see wont you.This is a great sequel and an excellent addition to the franchise. We're introduced to a few new characters in this one. The lovable loser, Arthur played by Justin Timberlake. The eccentric and slightly mad Merlin, voiced by the legend Eric Idle. The damsels are also a great addition to this film especially sleeping beauty. I found myself in tears of laughter at her constant nodding off at the most inappropriate times.Brilliant movie and is something that all Shrek fans shouldn't shy away from.

All the fairytale ladies have to break out of the tower and give a nice fight sequence, but are recaptured. Shrek returns and with the help of Arty, saves the day.

Mom""","[0, 0]","The third outing for the Shrek franchise is serviceable and amusing - no joke too low to stoop for, which will amuse adolescents and anyone younger as it demolishes high-school mope-fests, the Arthurian legends, dinner-theater venues and the princess phenomenon along with Far Far Away's throne room. Shrek the Third struck a lot of reviewers as claim out of which all the original wit had been mined, and perhaps they have a point. Now we know what to expect; this is just the continuation of the story of a love-struck ogre coping with love and responsibility in a deeply skewed world. But watching Shrek The Third remains a more agreeable use of an hour and a half than a lot of other movies out there, first run and DVD release. The princesses storming the castle with the aid of Snow White's little woodland friends and a blast of ""Barracuda"" is definitely worth the cost of the DVD, as is Eric Idle voicing the befuddled Merlin as a nervous high school teacher.The extras included are generous and a bit of a mixed bag: Artie's Worchester High yearbook is a very long and detailed send-up, and funnier if the viewer knows the Arthurian canon. The ""Donkey Dance"" is a quick and witty parody of ""Safety Dance"", but the ""lost scenes"" are just original story-board sketches with outlining an assortment of scenes not developed past that point. (We lost interest at the first, and fast-forwarded through the next two.) ""Big Green Goofs"" are a disturbing collection of computer glitches involving the characters animations and scenes which was at least interesting.

1096487,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000UVKGPI,Chris Pandolfi,"[0, 1]","The main premise behind ""Shrek the Third"" begs the question of whether or not an ogre is fit to be a king. This is certainly an adequate premise. What isn't so adequate is the film's extreme jokiness. This isn't to say that the first two films weren't funny; indeed, both had many moments that made the audience laugh. However, they still managed to be fairy tales, with decent doses of genuine drama throughout. The same can't be said for this new film; it's much more of a comedy, filled with sight gags and one-liners that would only appeal to younger audiences (or at least to audiences who believe that a film's story is irrelevant). While I am recommending ""Shrek the Third"" for being light-hearted and pleasant to look at, you should know that it's not as good as 2001's ""Shrek"" and nowhere near as good as 2004's ""Shrek 2.""Here's the plot: Shrek, our beloved green ogre (voiced by Mike Myers), is now an accepted member of the royal family. By law, this means that he's next in line for the throne; his father-in-law--the Frog King (John Cleese)--explains this on his deathbed (in a scene that was more comical than it should have been). Even though he and Shrek have long since buried the hatchet, Shrek makes it clear that he's not ready to be Far Far Away's next king. Such insecurity should come as no surprise to anyone familiar with the first two films: his first struggle was his love for Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz); his second was getting the royal family to accept him as an ogre. This time around, he struggles not only with the possibility of being a ruler, but also with the reality that Fiona is pregnant.Just before the King croaks (pun definitely intended), he tells Shrek of a second heir to the throne: Fiona's cousin, Arthur (Justin Timberlake), nicknamed Artie. Shrek--along with his faithful sidekicks Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Puss in Boots (Antonio Bandaris)--immediately set sail to find him, only to discover a teenager that's picked on by everyone in high school (even the unpopular nerds are mean to him). Despite his eagerness to leave, Artie is just as reluctant to be the next ruler of Far Far Away as Shrek is. Needless to say, it's going to take a lot of convincing to get him to cooperate.Meanwhile, things aren't looking so bright in Far Far Away; the arrogant Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) has joined forces with every fairy tale villain imaginable, and they've taken control of the kingdom. Fiona, her mother (Julie Andrews), and a group of snobby fairy tale princesses have been captured and imprisoned. Thus is the reality of Charming's anger: he's been quite bitter since losing both his mother and Fiona's hand at the end of the previous film, and he clearly wants his revenge. It doesn't help that he's since been reduced to working as an actor in a rowdy dinner theater. Considering his flair for theatrics, I guess his plan to kill Shrek during a live stage show makes perfect sense. Or maybe it's just silly; I'm not exactly sure anymore.What I am sure about is the extremely silly nature of the film as a whole. Consider a subplot with Merlin (Eric Idle), made to be incompetent for this story; one of his spells results in Donkey and Puss switching bodies. This proves troublesome later on in the film, when Puss tries to distract a group of guards with his signature cute expression (his eyes widen considerably, his ears droop, and he would innocently hold his hat). Donkey's face doesn't allow for any cuteness to emerge; ""Let's kill it!"" the guards shout before charging. And then there are the many supporting characters, such as Gingy the Gingerbread Man, Pinocchio, the Three Little Pigs, and the Big Bad Wolf, all of which provided some comedy relief throughout the entire series. Unfortunately, they're less effective in this film because pretty much every character is comedic. There's no balance between comedy and drama anymore--it's a lopsided film that relies on entirely on its sense of humor. This wouldn't have been so bad had the first two films been the same way.However, I was impressed by some of the comedic material. I'm directly referring to Shrek coming to terms with fatherhood; it's highlighted by a dream sequence in which hundreds of baby ogres invade his cottage. Such moments made ""Shrek the Third"" worth recommending, despite being an undeniably inferior film. At this point, my only concern is whether or not another ""Shrek"" film will hit theaters; if this trend of declining quality continues, I don't think I'll be able to recommend the fourth installment. I say this because there was just enough about this installment to recommend. While it's a triumph of computer generated technology, and while the film looks incredible, the story and the overactive sense of humor leave much to be desired.",4,He's Ogre-Stayed His Welcome,1179446400,"05 18, 2007",2007,4790,"['main', 'premise', 'Shrek', 'Third', 'question', 'not', 'ogre', 'fit', 'be', 'king', 'certainly', 'adequate', 'premise', 'What', ""n't"", 'so', 'adequate', 'film', 'extreme', 'jokiness', ""n't"", 'say', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'were', ""n't"", 'funny', 'indeed', 'had', 'many', 'moments', 'made', 'audience', 'laugh', 'However', 'still', 'managed', 'be', 'fairy', 'tales', 'decent', 'doses', 'genuine', 'drama', 'same', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'said', 'new', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'comedy', 'filled', 'sight', 'gags', 'one-liners', 'would', 'only', 'appeal', 'younger', 'audiences', 'least', 'audiences', 'who', 'believe', 'film', 'story', 'irrelevant', 'am', 'recommending', 'Shrek', 'Third', 'being', 'light-hearted', 'pleasant', 'look', 'should', 'know', 'not', 'as', 'good', '2001', 'Shrek', 'nowhere', 'as', 'good', '2004', 'Shrek', '2', 'Here', 'plot', 'Shrek', 'beloved', 'green', 'ogre', 'voiced', 'Mike', 'Myers', 'now', 'accepted', 'member', 'royal', 'family', 'law', 'next', 'line', 'throne', 'father-in-law', 'Frog', 'King', 'John', 'Cleese', 'deathbed', 'scene', 'was', 'more', 'comical', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Even', 'Shrek', 'have', 'long', 'buried', 'hatchet', 'Shrek', 'clear', 'not', 'ready', 'be', 'Far', 'Far', 'Away', 'next', 'king', 'Such', 'insecurity', 'should', 'come', 'surprise', 'anyone', 'familiar', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'first', 'struggle', 'was', 'love', 'Princess', 'Fiona', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'second', 'was', 'getting', 'royal', 'family', 'accept', 'ogre', 'time', 'around', 'not', 'only', 'possibility', 'being', 'ruler', 'also', 'reality', 'Fiona', 'pregnant.Just', 'King', 'croaks', 'pun', 'definitely', 'intended', 'Shrek', 'second', 'heir', 'throne', 'Fiona', 'cousin', 'Arthur', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'nicknamed', 'Artie', 'Shrek', 'faithful', 'sidekicks', 'Donkey', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'Puss', 'Boots', 'Antonio', 'Bandaris', 'immediately', 'set', 'sail', 'find', 'only', 'discover', 'teenager', 'picked', 'everyone', 'high', 'school', 'even', 'unpopular', 'nerds', 'are', 'mean', 'eagerness', 'leave', 'Artie', 'just', 'as', 'reluctant', 'be', 'next', 'ruler', 'Far', 'Far', 'Away', 'Shrek', 'Needless', 'say', 'going', 'take', 'lot', 'convincing', 'get', 'cooperate.Meanwhile', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'looking', 'so', 'bright', 'Far', 'Far', 'Away', 'arrogant', 'Prince', 'Charming', 'Rupert', 'Everett', 'joined', 'forces', 'fairy', 'tale', 'villain', 'imaginable', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'control', 'kingdom', 'Fiona', 'mother', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'group', 'snobby', 'fairy', 'tale', 'princesses', 'have', 'been', 'captured', 'imprisoned', 'Thus', 'reality', 'Charming', 'anger', 'been', 'quite', 'bitter', 'losing', 'mother', 'Fiona', 'hand', 'end', 'previous', 'film', 'clearly', 'revenge', ""n't"", 'help', 'been', 'reduced', 'working', 'actor', 'rowdy', 'dinner', 'theater', 'Considering', 'flair', 'theatrics', 'guess', 'plan', 'kill', 'Shrek', 'live', 'stage', 'show', 'perfect', 'sense', 'just', 'silly', ""'m"", 'not', 'exactly', 'sure', 'am', 'sure', 'extremely', 'silly', 'nature', 'film', 'whole', 'Consider', 'subplot', 'Merlin', 'Eric', 'Idle', 'made', 'be', 'incompetent', 'story', 'one', 'spells', 'results', 'Donkey', 'Puss', 'switching', 'bodies', 'troublesome', 'later', 'film', 'when', 'Puss', 'distract', 'group', 'guards', 'signature', 'cute', 'expression', 'eyes', 'widen', 'considerably', 'ears', 'droop', 'would', 'innocently', 'hold', 'hat', 'Donkey', 'face', ""n't"", 'allow', 'cuteness', 'emerge', 'Let', 'kill', 'guards', 'shout', 'charging', 'then', 'are', 'many', 'supporting', 'characters', 'such', 'Gingy', 'Gingerbread', 'Man', 'Pinocchio', 'Three', 'Little', 'Pigs', 'Big', 'Bad', 'Wolf', 'provided', 'comedy', 'relief', 'entire', 'series', 'Unfortunately', ""'re"", 'less', 'effective', 'film', 'pretty', 'much', 'character', 'comedic', 'balance', 'comedy', 'drama', 'anymore', 'lopsided', 'film', 'entirely', 'sense', 'humor', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'so', 'bad', 'had', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'been', 'same', 'way.However', 'was', 'impressed', 'comedic', 'material', ""'m"", 'directly', 'referring', 'Shrek', 'coming', 'terms', 'fatherhood', 'highlighted', 'dream', 'sequence', 'hundreds', 'baby', 'ogres', 'invade', 'cottage', 'Such', 'moments', 'made', 'Shrek', 'Third', 'worth', 'recommending', 'being', 'undeniably', 'inferior', 'film', 'point', 'only', 'concern', 'not', 'Shrek', 'film', 'will', 'hit', 'theaters', 'trend', 'declining', 'quality', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'recommend', 'fourth', 'installment', 'say', 'was', 'just', 'enough', 'installment', 'recommend', 'triumph', 'computer', 'generated', 'technology', 'film', 'incredible', 'story', 'overactive', 'sense', 'humor', 'leave', 'much', 'be', 'desired']",N/A

While Shrek the original is about true romance, the Second is about meeting the parents and the Third is about getting ready to be a parent.In terms of characters, the duo of the donkey and the cat, royal to Shrek as always, is fun to watch. Prince Charming has a wicked voice (Rupert Everett) and such beautiful hair! The greater emphasis of the girl power and action scenes - Snow White, Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty - produce even more humour and excitement. In terms of animation, Princess Fionna is more beautiful than ever. Somehow her green face, big nose and plus size combined exudes real beauty. Her frown, her gaze and smile grab attention. In terms of storyline, there are gripping moments that may result in a tear or two - the last words of King Frog, the bond between Shrek and a young King-in-waiting, the downfall of Prince Charming.I can't say Shrek the Third outdo the previous two. All I can say is that it is a natural extension of its predecessors, providing as much entertainment and warmth. It feels good to see how the characters grow up and bond together.

1096495,A27FR2C67JPDRS,B000UVKGPI,Daryl B,"[3, 5]","In a summer of threequels (Spidey 3, Shrek 3, and Pirates 3), everyone's favorite green orge returns, complete with his true love, Fiona, and his sidekicks, Donkey and Puss in Boots.  The Shrek franchise is a popular series of films (and a definite money maker) and this film should continue that trend.  However, this film is not quite up to par with its predecessors.The story begins in Far Far Away Land where Fiona's father dies, but not before asking Shrek to step into his royal shoes and rule the kingdom.  Shrek is none-to-happy to fulfill the dying wishes of his dead father-in-law and decides to seek out another heir to the throne who the dying monarch mentions before he croaks...pun intended!With Shrek off on an adventure to find the heir, who turns out to be Arthur or ""Artie"" (King Arthur and played rather dimly by Justin Timberlake), the scheming Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) returns with an army of fairy tale villains determined to steal the throne and banish his green rival once and for all.The story this time around seems to take a little longer to get rolling and doesn't quite have the charm of the first two films.  The film does have its moments and I did love the fact that this movie empowers the fairy tale heroines (played by the wickedly talented, Mya Rudolph, Amy Sedaris, Cheri Oteri and Amy Pohler) who are normally relegated to being saved by a handsome and heroic prince.  This time the girls including Cinderella, Snow White, Sleepy Beauty and Fiona rush to the rescue of the men and give the twisted fairy tale a ""girl power"" makeover!  Another charming aspect of the film is that we get to see Shrek as a daddy, which provides an upbeat and endearing ending to the film.  One thing that did bother me a little is Donkey and Puss switching bodies after a magic spell goes wrong.  It was a funny bit but after a while it was a little disconcerting to hear the voice of Antonio Banderas coming out of donkey's mouth and Eddie Murphy's coming out of Puss' mouth.  And, as far as Timberlake voicing Arthur, I wasn't all that impressed.  If he were replaced in the fourth film, it really wouldn't bother me at all.But if you are a Shrek fan, I think you will enjoy the film.  It does have some funny moments and the animation, as usual, is beautiful.  A good addition to the Shrek franchise.",4,"Third time, not quite the charm...but still fun!",1179446400,"05 18, 2007",2007,2330,"['summer', 'threequels', 'Spidey', '3', 'Shrek', '3', '3', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'green', 'orge', 'returns', 'complete', 'true', 'love', 'Fiona', 'sidekicks', 'Donkey', 'Puss', 'Boots', 'Shrek', 'franchise', 'popular', 'series', 'films', 'definite', 'money', 'maker', 'film', 'should', 'continue', 'trend', 'However', 'film', 'not', 'quite', 'par', 'predecessors.The', 'story', 'Far', 'Far', 'Away', 'Land', 'where', 'Fiona', 'father', 'not', 'asking', 'Shrek', 'step', 'royal', 'shoes', 'rule', 'kingdom', 'Shrek', 'none-to-happy', 'fulfill', 'dying', 'wishes', 'dead', 'father-in-law', 'seek', 'out', 'heir', 'throne', 'who', 'dying', 'monarch', 'mentions', 'pun', 'intended', 'Shrek', 'off', 'adventure', 'find', 'heir', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'Arthur', 'Artie', 'King', 'Arthur', 'played', 'rather', 'dimly', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'scheming', 'Prince', 'Charming', 'Rupert', 'Everett', 'army', 'fairy', 'tale', 'villains', 'determined', 'steal', 'throne', 'banish', 'green', 'rival', 'once', 'all.The', 'story', 'time', 'around', 'take', 'little', 'longer', 'get', 'rolling', ""n't"", 'quite', 'have', 'charm', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'film', 'have', 'moments', 'did', 'love', 'fact', 'movie', 'fairy', 'tale', 'heroines', 'played', 'wickedly', 'talented', 'Mya', 'Rudolph', 'Amy', 'Sedaris', 'Cheri', 'Oteri', 'Amy', 'Pohler', 'who', 'are', 'normally', 'relegated', 'being', 'saved', 'handsome', 'heroic', 'prince', 'time', 'girls', 'including', 'Cinderella', 'Snow', 'White', 'Sleepy', 'Beauty', 'Fiona', 'rush', 'rescue', 'men', 'give', 'twisted', 'fairy', 'tale', 'girl', 'power', 'makeover', 'charming', 'aspect', 'film', 'get', 'see', 'Shrek', 'daddy', 'upbeat', 'endearing', 'ending', 'film', 'One', 'thing', 'did', 'bother', 'little', 'Donkey', 'Puss', 'switching', 'bodies', 'magic', 'spell', 'wrong', 'was', 'funny', 'bit', 'while', 'was', 'little', 'disconcerting', 'hear', 'voice', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'coming', 'out', 'donkey', 'mouth', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'coming', 'Puss', 'mouth', 'as', 'far', 'Timberlake', 'voicing', 'Arthur', 'was', ""n't"", 'impressed', 'were', 'replaced', 'fourth', 'film', 'really', 'would', ""n't"", 'bother', 'all.But', 'are', 'Shrek', 'fan', 'think', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'have', 'funny', 'moments', 'animation', 'usual', 'beautiful', 'good', 'addition', 'Shrek', 'franchise']",N/A

1096513,AY12DBB0U420B,B000UVKGPI,Gary Peterson,"[1, 1]","I rather enjoyed the original Shrek movie. It was different, and in an amusing way. The animation was excellent and the movie was somehow appealing. Shrek 2 was OK., but I didn't get the same enjoyment as with the first. I guess that's the usual case with sequels. I felt a little burned out on the whole idea. Lately, my fianc&eacute;e, who liked the Shrek movies better than I did, picked up the Shrek the Third DVD when we last visited the local warehouse club. We watched it a couple evenings later. I was feeling negative toward viewing another Shreck thing and that may have tainted the experience.Shrek the Third is well done. It's a polished piece of work. The animation is terrific. In  places, the film seems so realistic I have difficulty believing it's an animation. If this is the first Shrek movie someone has viewed, I think they would probably find it interesting and amusing. However, this is the third one for me and it just doesn't have much to offer beyond the first two. The word ""stale"" comes to mind. The movie has some funny sight gags and there's a few mild chuckles here and there. The story is light and frivolous. My main reaction on watching was mild boredom and I began to wonder when it would be over.I'd say that Shrek the Third is stale and uninteresting. That about sums it up. If you haven't seen a Shrek movie you might enjoy it, although I'd suggest the original or even the second. Kids might enjoy it.

Julie Andrews as the Queen has perhaps five lines in the whole movie, although her character is onscreen much more than that. Mostly she just stands around and observes. There are some fun bits, and Jason Timberlake, teenage heart-throb, is on hand a Prince Artie. He's not bad at all. And Eric Idle as Merlin is fun. The other characters just continue doing what they did in the last two films, although to a lesser degree. And in this film, more than in any of the other current animated features, it's quite obvious that each actor was in the recording booth alone. There is no interaction, no conversation: only overlapping monologues. (To see what a difference it makes to have the cast performing together, try SURF'S UP.)

1096522,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000UVKGPI,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[12, 14]","Some SPOILERS follow.Even though Shrek - Sir Shrek, that is - and Princess Fiona have become a fixture at the royal court of the kingdom of Far Far Away, it doesn't mean that our ogrish hero has to like it. With Fiona's father having been transformed into a frog (see SHREK 2) and then falling ill, Shrek grumpily chips in by undertaking some of his dad-in-law's royal chores. But the mantle of the purple settles uncomfortably on Shrek's shoulders (and it probably itches, too). All he really wants to do is take Fiona and go back to his beloved swamps. But that would have to wait when the fast expiring King names Shrek as his successor. But Shrek doesn't want the crown and so, with Donkey and Puss in Boots in tow and again providing sidekick duties, he goes on a journey to fetch the next guy in line for the throne - Prince Arthur. Of course, there are obstacles awaiting Shrek. For one thing, Fiona lays down some news which distresses our ogre. Then Prince Charming, who's been reduced to entertaining in dinner theater, decides to make another bid for his own ""happily ever after."" Accordingly, he manages to enlist a heapload of fairy tale villains (Captain Hook, Rumpelstiltskin, the Headless Horseman, the Cyclops, several villainous trees, and more...).SHREK THE THIRD, while being a fun and funny flick, is the least of the three Shrek movies. Of course, the element of surprise, which made the first Shrek film such an uberhit as it riotously turned fairy tale tradition on its ear, is long since gone. The sequel provided us with the kingdom of Far Far Away, which paved the way for even more snarky, nudge-in-the-rib stabs at pop culture in general and at the Disney film factory line in particular. Some of the wit is still here in SHREK THE THIRD, though not as razor sharp. The humor still made me smile, though it wasn't quite as subversive or as disarming. Basically, it's all stuff I'd seen already. I was waiting for something new to knock me off my feet. It didn't happen.The movie suffers most when the spotlight is on its newest character Prince Arthur. As voiced by Justin Timberlake, ""Artie's"" tepid personality proves to be a detriment not so easily brushed aside. Artie is introduced as a loser teen and then, as the film progresses, supposedly shows his mettle when he reveals his smarts by throwing a crying fit and, later on, by unveiling his gift of gab (where was this when he was getting picked on in medieval high school?). To me, Artie comes off as wheedling and even a bit disingenuous. The fact that he took screen time away from Shrek and that he has a significant role to play in the film's resolution just doesn't sit well with me.Points are also taken away for not giving heftier roles to Donkey and Puss in Boots. These two great characters are pretty much relegated to the background. Their one highlight sub-plot, which has them switching bodies, doesn't pay off with anything significant and is, therefore, superfluous and lame to the nth power. It was funny, though, to watch Puss, while in Donkey's form, attempt to use his ""cute"" power.Despite a nagging feeling of ""Is that it?"" I have to point out that there's still so much going for this film. For one thing, the old reliables are at it again. Mike Meyers as Shrek, Cameron Diaz as Fiona, Eddie Murphy as Donkey, and Antonio Banderas as Puss in Boots have their characters down pat and their voice performances are seamless. Meanwhile, John Cleese as the frog king is priceless in his one prolonged cameo. Newcomers of note are Eric Idle as the slightly skewed Merlin and several SNL actresses portraying various fairy tale princesses. Rupert Everett also returns as that royal swine Prince Charming and is majestically over the top, while Ian McShane has several standout moments as Captain Hook.The incorporation of classic rock music adds a nice touch to several scenes, although it's a bit odd to hear Led Zeppelin, Heart, and Wings in an animation. But, hey, any chance to hear ""Barracuda"" or ""Live and Let Die"" is a good thing. The animation? Wow! It's amazing. If anything, the CG is even better than in the prior Shrek flicks. For example, the expressions on the characters' faces are realistically conveyed. Even when groaning thru the one scene of Prince Charming tossing his hair in slow motion, I still couldn't help but note the excellence of the graphics. So, yes, a well-deserved pat on the back for DreamWorks.SHREK THE THIRD has already made piles of money and stands to make even more with the dvd release. And, apparently, a fourth installment is in the works, as well as a Puss in Boots spin-off. While this third film doesn't live up to the quality and originality of the first two, it still boasts several sparkling moments, the aforementioned frog king scene being only one of 'em. There are also some nice bits with the Princesses Snow White, Cinderella, and Sleeping Beauty. I also liked that the medieval high school girls spoke with ""thees"" and ""thous"" but in a Valley accent. And, of course and always, at the heart of this franchise, there is Shrek, the cantankerous ogre with the heart of gold. True, he doesn't do much here (his supporting cast supply most of the smiting) but he does provide the grounding element of the movie and remains the preferred point of view character for the audience. As more Shrek movies are churned out, it's nice to see that some things do stay the same.SHREK THE THIRD elicits some laughs, plenty of smiles, and, sadly, a few yawns. The good will garnered from the first two installments goes quite a ways in carrying this film. Ultimately, I do consider the time and money to have been well spent on this one. So, yes, I got my Shrek on, now go get yours.",4,Shrek the Third - it doesn't sucketh; three and a half stars,1188086400,"08 26, 2007",2007,5725,"['SPOILERS', 'follow.Even', 'Shrek', 'Sir', 'Shrek',

1096523,A3IF5BJFPH8OG5,B000UVKGPI,Hectic,"[11, 16]","When the first Shrek came out in theaters, I didn't bother to go see it since I thought it was a movie geared more towards little kids.  But after I heard more of the hype and some of my friends told me it was a really good flick for any age, I went ahead and bought it when it came out on DVD and it did not disappoint.  I was rolling on the floor!  When Shrek 2 came along, went and saw it in the theaters and was rolling in the aisles!Before seeing any movie, I like to read reviews about it.  (Even if I know I'll want to see it anyway no matter what the reviews say)  I only read reviews by the everyday Joe, not critics since they usually go more to critique a movie, not to enjoy it.  Shrek 3 had mixed reviews, and I wished I had listened to the ones saying it sucked before I wasted my 5 bucks!Shrek the Third stinks like your neighbor's cookin'!  The first 2 were great, the 2nd surpassing the first in some ways, but by the time they got to making the 3rd it seems like the writers had dug out of their recycle bins for ideas because they couldn't think of any fresh ones!  The story is dull and strung together, rarely any truly funny moments (maybe enough to give you a chuckle here and there), and a number of obvious jokes that a child of 6 could fill in went unused during the course of the movie!  Example:  When King Harold (as a frog) dies, Puss 'n' Boots just says, ""The king is dead."" or something to that affect.  HELLO!!!  Instead it should have been, ""The king has croaked.""!  It is pretty obvious and may be such a cheap joke that you could find it at a $.99 cent store, but a cheap joke here and there is better than none at all!  And that's pretty much what the 3rd Shrek movie has---nothing!I can't believe that this movie did as well as it did at the box office.  Recently I read that Dreamworks already has Shrek 4 in the works (to be released in 2009) and that there is even talk of a Shrek 5!  If Shrek the 3rd is any indication of how the next one will be, they should have stopped at Shrek 2!  On the other hand, it might end up being like the Alien series; the 3rd one sucked, but the 4th (while not as good as the first 2) was still better than the 3rd one, no contest!",2,Shrek the Third Doesn't Even Deserve A Third Star!,1186963200,"08 13, 2007",2007,2205,"['When', 'first', 'Shrek', 'came', 'out', 'theaters', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'go', 'see', 'thought', 'was', 'movie', 'geared', 'more', 'towards', 'little', 'kids', 'heard', 'more', 'hype', 'friends', 'told', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'flick', 'age', 'went', 'ahead', 'bought', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'DVD', 'did', 'not', 'disappoint', 'was', 'rolling', 'floor', 'When', 'Shrek', '2', 'came', 'along', 'went', 'saw', 'theaters', 'was', 'rolling', 'aisles', 'seeing', 'movie', 'like', 'read', 'reviews', 'Even', 'know', ""'ll"", 'want', 'see', 'anyway', 'matter', 'what', 'reviews', 'say', 'only', 'read', 'reviews', 'everyday', 'Joe', 'not', 'critics', 'usually', 'go', 'more', 'critique', 'movie', 'not', 'enjoy', 'Shrek', '3', 'had', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'wished', 'had', 'listened', 'ones', 'saying', 'sucked', 'wasted', '5', 'bucks', 'Shrek', 'Third', 'stinks', 'neighbor', 'cookin', 'first', '2', 'were', 'great', '2nd', 'surpassing', 'first', 'ways', 'time', 'got', 'making', '3rd', 'writers', 'had', 'dug', 'recycle', 'bins', 'ideas', 'could', ""n't"", 'think', 'fresh', 'ones', 'story', 'dull', 'strung', 'together', 'rarely', 'truly', 'funny', 'moments', 'maybe', 'enough', 'give', 'chuckle', 'here', 'there', 'number', 'obvious', 'jokes', 'child', '6', 'could', 'fill', 'went', 'unused', 'course', 'movie', 'Example', 'When', 'King', 'Harold', 'frog', 'Puss', 'n', 'Boots', 'just', 'king', 'dead', 'something', 'affect', 'Instead', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'king', 'croaked.', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'may', 'be', 'such', 'cheap', 'joke', 'could', 'find', '.99', 'cent', 'store', 'cheap', 'joke', 'here', 'better', 'none', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', '3rd', 'Shrek', 'movie', '-nothing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'movie', 'did', 'as', 'well', 'did', 'box', 'office', 'Recently', 'read', 'Dreamworks', 'already', 'Shrek', '4', 'works', 'be', 'released', '2009', 'even', 'talk', 'Shrek', '5', 'Shrek', '3rd', 'indication', 'how', 'next', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'should', 'have', 'stopped', 'Shrek', '2', 'other', 'hand', 'might', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'Alien', 'series', '3rd', 'one', 'sucked', '4th', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'first', '2', 'was', 'still', 'better', '3rd', 'one', 'contest']",N/A

To be fair, from a story standpoint, this doesn't drop the ball quite like 2004's ""Shrek 2"" but is something that the whole family can enjoy, as there's plenty of obvious humor for the kids, as well as more subtle, subversive humor for the adults. The voice acting is up to par for both Myers and Murphy who are excellent as Shrek and Donkey. There's an ease about their performances that no doubt comes from long familiarity with the characters and with each other - this is the third installment, after all - that communicates the friendship between Shrek and Donkey to the audience, making the film that much more fun to watch. Add in Banderas' excellent performance as Puss in Boots, and you've got a real winning combination. Justin Timberlake, as King Artie, meshed surprisingly well with the act of those who had been through the previous two.""Shrek the Third"" found some room for a story about personal responsibility and impending fatherhood, themes that are new to the series. That's not to say it's a story well-told; too often does the movie seem to try and manipulate an emotional response from us in tried and true ways (a melancholy song or quick change of mood) that is counteractive from the original's genuine charm and feeling. Gone is director Andrew Adamson- off making the second ""Chronicles of Narnia"" film, and his intelligent feel for the material is missed as co-directors Chris Miller and Raman Hui- working with an army of four screenwriters- go through the motions of telling the story, with predictable plot devices and easy jokes (some of which are funny, but not enough) while introducing new characters (like Eric Idle's inspired Merlin) and finding room for old favorites (Pinocchio and Gingerbread Man) at the service of a story that's just good enough to keep people in their seats. I suppose the curse of the third-film letdown could strike ""Shrek"" as it has so many- artistically, it already has- but come on, this is summer, this is a ""Shrek"" movie, and it's got just enough of what its' target audience wants to keep them coming back for more come, what, 2010?I'd be enjoying the franchise a lot more if it were offering anything new artistically (not complaining about the animation here; it's spectacular without calling attention to itself (Happy Feet- call it a quiet confidence); but at least their rivals at Pixar do sequels for the right reasons- they have a darn good story to tell (anyone else excited about ""Toy Story 3"" being written by ""Little Miss Sunshine"" Oscar winner Michael Arndt?).

Most reviews knock the use of the song (Live and Let Die) being played during the King's funeral saying it doesn't work. But I thought the frogs singing the song was pretty funny and I heard people laughing too. So critics don't know much. Anyway, with the King dead Shrek seaks out a relative of Fiona who's next up to be King. It's a boy named Artie who's supposed to be a young Arthur. He's voiced by an unfunny and annoying Justin Timberlake. I tried to like him but the addition of him is pretty forgettable. When everyone is dancing at the end, I doubt anyone will even ask...where's Artie ?When Shrek is sailing away to find Artie Fiona tells him he's going to be a father. Which leads to a funny nightmare scene about what fatherhood will be like for him. While he's gone Prince Charming makes an army of fairytale villians to help him take over Far Far Away and become King. Fiona and other princesses are all that stand in his way when Shrek is gone.Shrek the 3rd has some good laughs although some you have to be an adult to understand why they are funny. It has some charm too but most of it comes at the very end. The movie is mostly about Shrek and Artie having to learn from each other. But still I didn't really care about Artie much.

1096546,A3LIWTQDSQ5UOO,B000UVKGPI,"Jonathan Oyama ""Welcome to die!""","[1, 1]","Well, Shrek the Third definitely will satsify fans of the trilogy. After all, who wouldn't love to see more fairy tale jokes? All the visuals were very impressive. I especially loved the tribute to Walt Disney's ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarves"", using the actual audio track from one of the songs. However, all in all, I was Shreked out. I was tired of the same old jokes.The story isn't bad. In the plot, the king of Ever After land, in his dying words, names Shrek the new king. Shrek, however, isn't willing to work his butt off as king, so he asks the king whether there is a second in line. The king then names a boy named Arthur as the king after Shrek. The main story focuses on Shrek finding Artie, while Prince Charming gathers villains together to take over the kingdom.There were many scenes I chuckled at, such as the kingdom that was modeled after a high school. However, I didn't like the teenage Arthur character, played miserably by Justin Timberlake. And I didn't think the villains were as smart as they could have been. Somehow, in the end, Arthur convinces the villains that they could do something more worthwhile, rather than fight. And Prince Charming is left with an empty vendetta against Shrek, taunted at by everyone else.I'm not saying that this movie is a bad movie. I've just seen this same old hero-wins-all storyline before and I think ""Ratatouille"" is a far better bang for people's buck (and more original too).",3,Three's not company,1195862400,"11 24, 2007",2007,1447,"['Well', 'Shrek', 'Third', 'definitely', 'will', 'satsify', 'fans', 'trilogy', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'love', 'see', 'more', 'fairy', 'tale', 'jokes', 'visuals', 'were', 'very', 'impressive', 'especially', 'loved', 'tribute', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Snow', 'White', 'Seven', 'Dwarves', 'using', 'actual', 'audio', 'track', 'one', 'songs', 'However', 'was', 'Shreked', 'out', 'was', 'tired', 'same', 'old', 'jokes.The', 'story', ""n't"", 'bad', 'plot', 'king', 'Ever', 'land', 'dying', 'words', 'names', 'Shrek', 'new', 'king', 'Shrek', 'however', ""n't"", 'willing', 'work', 'butt', 'off', 'king', 'king', 'second', 'line', 'king', 'then', 'boy', 'named', 'Arthur', 'king', 'Shrek', 'main', 'story', 'focuses', 'Shrek', 'finding', 'Artie', 'Prince', 'Charming', 'gathers', 'together', 'take', 'over', 'kingdom.There', 'were', 'many', 'scenes', 'chuckled', 'such', 'kingdom', 'was', 'modeled', 'high', 'school', 'However', 'did', ""n't"", 'teenage', 'Arthur', 'character', 'played', 'miserably', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'villains', 'were', 'as', 'smart', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Somehow', 'end', 'Arthur', 'villains', 'could', 'do', 'something', 'more', 'worthwhile', 'rather', 'fight', 'Prince', 'Charming', 'left', 'empty', 'vendetta', 'Shrek', 'taunted', 'everyone', 'else.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'movie', 'bad', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'just', 'seen', 'same', 'old', 'hero-wins-all', 'storyline', 'think', 'Ratatouille', 'far', 'better', 'bang', 'people', 'buck', 'more', 'original', 'too']",N/A
1096547,A2UZLIH3BSGJ3N,B000UVKGPI,"Jonny Rotten ""even handed critic""","[0, 0]","Like all trilogies and/or sequels, Shrek the Third lacks the charm and originality than gained the original film its popularity. Shrek the Third is nothing more than an excuse for excuse's sake to continue the franchise and for Hollywood to ""ride the money train"".I resisted watching this film in the theater, and it turned out for good reason. While it's not a total and utter disappointment like other films or sequels I've seen, it just lacks ""the punch"" that the first film possessed. There were some funny moments here and there, but the use of the same gags and humor for a third time around just lacks the punch line. To my disappointment, I read a while back of the plan to not only make a fourth Shrek film, but that a spin off with Puss in Boots is in the discussion stage as well. Has Hollywood grown this desperate?Well, fortunately for them, they have the gullible public to fall back on so they will always make a profit. How much more pathetic and disappointing can Hollywood become and the public be? A boycott is called for (I.M.O) for people to be more responsible and deliver a message to demand a better film, more ""bang"" for your buck be produced rather than settle for the garbage over and over again. Costs have been rising in most places to see and enjoy a film in a theater. To some, maybe they are just easily entertained and like someone with tunnel vision and blinders on, they just can't tell the difference and any empty, shallow intelligence draining film will do. Come on, wake up folks.I understand it's hard to say ""No"" to you kids. They are bombarded with commercials and toys of such films as Shrek virtually by the minute, but you could at least hold out for something better, and worst case scenario...wait until it hits the DVD shelf? These days the turn around has been widdled down to a few short months instead of years. So, in basic summery, Shrek the Third delivers a simple message of just ""believing in oneself"" surrounded by a basic story of Shrek inheriting the Kingdom of Far, Far Away but not wanting it because he's an Ogre. Prince Charming rallies all the other ""losers"" or the faerie world to take over the kingdom, Shrek is sent on a quest to retrieve the ""next"" in line, Fiona is pregnant and what you have here is a soap opera for kids.Like I said, there are some laughs and some entertaining moments, but nothing to write home about. The first Shrek film is obviously the best of choice, and I did like the second one as well, but the third just doesn't deliver. Kids can't typically tell the difference, but parents should. How can you not know when you are being fed a plate of ""crap""? I can sniff out a stinker a mile away and more.There are many ""give aways"" and tell tale signs of how bad a film is going to suck. One of the easiest is when you have an original film that is rich, new and original such as the first ""Shrek"" film and then sequels are made to dilute everything down from one film to the next. Another is by being aware how much a film is being promoted. Sequels typically ride the shirt tales of profit and popularity. The more a film is promoted, the chances of it being a dud on screen is awfully high, or sometimes...the ""lack of"" promotion simply because the studio knows it will make  money is DVD sales and rentals no matter how bad it is. Lastly, you can pin it on talent, or lack there of. Bad actors make good scripts bad and bad ones ever worse, and occasionally the opposite, a badly written script or thought out plot can make a great actor look ridiculous.Obvious stinkers are: The Incredible Hulk, Godzilla, Transformers, Titanic (made a blockbuster solely by ""popularity""),The Ocean's 12,13 films, Star Wars: The Phantom Menace and it's following prequels, a few of the Star Trek films, Spiderman 2 and especially 3,Crank, Smoking Aces, The Fast and the Furious films/sequels and the list goes on and is ever growing. Do yourself a favor and be a bit more mindful of bad films before you grant them a 4 or 5 star rating and bit less of a gullible consumer.",2,Old gags and humor make up Shrek the Third,1195344000,"11 18, 2007",2007,4048,"['trilogies', 'and/or', 'sequels', 'Shrek', 'Third', 'charm', 'originality', 'gained', 'original', 'film', 'popularity', 'Shrek', 'Third', 'nothing', 'more', 'excuse', 'excuse', 'sake', 'continue', 'franchise', 'Hollywood', 'ride', 'money', 'train', '.I', 'resisted', 'watching', 'film', 'theater', 'turned', 'out', 'good', 'reason', 'not', 'total', 'utter', 'disappointment', 'other', 'films', 'sequels', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'just', 'punch', 'first', 'film', 'possessed', 'were', 'funny', 'moments', 'here', 'there', 'use', 'same', 'gags', 'humor', 'third', 'time', 'just', 'punch', 'line', 'disappointment', 'read', 'while', 'back', 'plan', 'not', 'only', 'make', 'fourth', 'Shrek', 'film', 'spin', 'off', 'Puss', 'Boots', 'discussion', 'stage', 'as', 'well', 'Has', 'Hollywood', 'grown', 'desperate', 'Well', 'fortunately', 'have', 'gullible', 'public', 'fall', 'back', 'will', 'always', 'make', 'profit', 'How', 'much', 'more', 'pathetic', 'disappointing', 'can', 'Hollywood', 'become', 'public', 'be', 'boycott', 'called', 'I.M.O', 'people', 'be', 'more', 'responsible', 'deliver', 'message', 'demand', 'better', 'film', 'more', 'bang', 'buck', 'be', 'produced', 'rather', 'settle', 'garbage', 'over', 'again', 'Costs', 'have', 'been', 'rising', 'most', 'places', 'see', 'enjoy', 'film', 'theater', 'maybe', 'are', 'just', 'easily', 'entertained', 'someone', 'tunnel', 'vision', 'blinders', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'difference', 'empty', 'shallow', 'intelligence', 'draining', 'film', 'will', 'do', 'Come', 'wake', 'up', 'folks.I', 'hard', 'say', 'No', 'kids', 'are', 'bombarded', 'commercials', 'toys', 'such', 'films', 'Shrek', 'virtually', 'minute', 'could', 'least', 'hold', 'out', 'something', 'better', 'worst', 'case', 'scenario', 'wait', 'DVD', 'shelf', 'days', 'turn', 'around', 'been', 'widdled', 'down', 'few', 'short', 'months', 'instead', 'years', 'So', 'basic', 'summery', 'Shrek', 'Third', 'delivers', 'simple', 'message', 'just', 'believing', 'surrounded', 'basic', 'story', 'Shrek', 'inheriting', 'Kingdom', 'Far', 'Far', 'Away', 'not', 'wanting', 'Ogre', 'Prince', 'Charming', 'other', 'losers', 'faerie', 'world', 'take', 'over', 'kingdom', 'Shrek', 'sent', 'quest', 'retrieve', 'next', 'line', 'Fiona', 'pregnant', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'soap', 'opera', 'kids.Like', 'said', 'are', 'laughs', 'entertaining', 'moments', 'nothing', 'write', 'home', 'first', 'Shrek', 'film', 'obviously', 'best', 'choice', 'did', 'second', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'third', 'just', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'Kids', 'ca', ""n't"", 'typically', 'tell', 'difference', 'parents', 'should', 'How', 'can', 'not', 'know', 'when', 'are', 'being', 'fed', 'plate', 'crap', 'can', 'sniff', 'out', 'stinker', 'mile', 'away', 'more.There', 'are', 'many', 'give', 'aways', 'tell', 'tale', 'signs', 'how', 'bad', 'film', 'going', 'suck', 'One', 'easiest', 'when', 'have', 'original', 'film', 'rich', 'new', 'original', 'such', 'first', 'Shrek', 'film', 'then', 'sequels', 'are', 'made', 'dilute', 'everything', 'down', 'one', 'film', 'next', 'being', 'aware', 'how', 'much', 'film', 'being', 'promoted', 'Sequels', 'typically', 'ride', 'shirt', 'tales', 'profit', 'popularity', 'more', 'film', 'promoted', 'chances', 'being', 'dud', 'screen', 'awfully', 'high', 'sometimes', 'lack', 'promotion', 'simply', 'studio', 'will', 'make', 'money', 'DVD', 'sales', 'rentals', 'matter', 'how', 'bad', 'Lastly', 'can', 'pin', 'talent', 'lack', 'Bad', 'actors', 'make', 'good', 'scripts', 'bad', 'bad', 'ones', 'ever', 'worse', 'occasionally', 'opposite', 'badly', 'written', 'script', 'thought', 'out', 'plot', 'can', 'make', 'great', 'actor', 'look', 'ridiculous.Obvious', 'stinkers', 'are', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'Godzilla', 'Transformers', 'Titanic', 'made', 'blockbuster', 'solely', 'popularity', 'Ocean', '12,13', 'films', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Phantom', 'Menace', 'following', 'prequels', 'few', 'Star', 'Trek', 'films', 'Spiderman', '2', 'especially', '3', 'Crank', 'Smoking', 'Aces', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'films/sequels', 'list', 'ever', 'growing', 'Do', 'favor', 'be', 'bit', 'more', 'mindful', 'bad', 'films', 'grant', '4', '5', 'star', 'rating', 'bit', 'less', 'gullible', 'consumer']",N/A

I like Disney's stories, but I'm so familiar with them that it's nice to see a good parody.And second, because of the music. I never liked Led Zeppelin's ""Immigrant Song"" until I heard it in this context. I likewise have a new appreciation for Wings' ""Live and Let Die.""

1096553,A27CHILBK6HIL2,B000UVKGPI,Kaya Savas,"[1, 2]","MOVIE: The summer of thirds continues. We've had Spider-Man 3 so far, which is in the running for biggest disappointment of the year, the third Pirates film is coming up and should be a blast, and we have Ocean's 13 and The Bourne Ultimatum rounding out the group of thirds. This monster month of May continues with Shrek The Third, and thankfully we have our first enjoyable film of the summer. Fans of the first two movies will flock to this one in great anticipation. The movie itself is a treat and will please kids and adults alike, but unfortunately the movie suffers from sequelitis in that it has lost some steam.While the movie is not as fresh as the first two it does offer plenty to entertain. The jokes come flying in fast and they are funny. There is a lot of physical comedy I guess you could say, but we still have the great popular culture references. There is also tons of humor that will fly right over the younger audience and make the experience worthwhile for adults. I saw a late screening and basically the entire audience was 17 and older and the place was a laugh factory. The movie even got applause at the end. Jokes like Puss saying goodbye to his many lovers or having a line like ""You are royally . . ."" with the curse word being blocked by a foghorn should give you a good belly laugh. In fact I felt that this movie was less orientated towards kids than the first two. The first two films had their fair share of farts and burps, but this installment toned back on it. The only kid orientated aspect of the film is having Justin Timberlake play Arthur, heir to the throne. Except that Arthur is in high school, so we get a scene of what school life would be like in the world of Shrek. I think a problem that some people will have is that there are so many characters now that it throws off the focus of the story. Characters like Pinocchio and Gingy serve simply as cutaways for jokes, while they are still hilarious it does lower the quality of the film when stacked up to what we've seen before.The biggest difference worth mentioning is the absence of director Andrew Adamson who made his start with the first two. Adamson's direction was superb and is the reason why the first two are just great comedic family films. Since he is busy with his Narnia empire he wasn't able to direct Shrek The Third. Adamson did do the story but he didn't do the screenplay. The result is a notable lack of structure and timing for the jokes and the story as a whole. It seems as if we are dropped in the middle of everything; there is no set up. Alas this is a sequel, but I think some establishing of the story couldn't have hurt. The other thing I had a problem with was the unbelievable overuse of popular songs. Some songs felt out of place and some just didn't work at all. There were too many songs and not enough score. Harry Gregson-Williams has been part of this franchise since the beginning and he returned to score the third one despite Andrew Adamson leaving. It feels like that they drown out his score completely with all the songs. Granted you don't go see a movie like this for the score, but I think the score played a big part in the first two and I hardly recall noticing most of it this time around. Thankfully he will be getting a score release in June so I can sit aside and give it a listen then.ACTING: In the voice department everything is on par with the previous two. The actors give the same enthusiasm to their characters as before and once again Antonio Banderas shines with Puss In Boots. Eric Idle is probably the best addition to the cast as Merlin the wizard. Idle plays Merlin after he's had a nervous breakdown, and the character steals some of the funniest moments in the film.BOTTON LINE: The bottom line here is that Shrek The Third is not as good as the first two, but it's still better than most animated films out there. I laughed a lot and found it to be worth my time as a summer fare. The lack of focus and structure plus the overuse of popular music didn't ruin the experience, but I do think it shows that when you change directors there is in fact a difference. Go see Shrek The Third and have a good time, it was certainly more enjoyable than Spider-Man 3 that's for sure.",4,Andrew Adamson's Absence As Director Is Notable But The Film Is Still Hilarious & Fun Even If Unfocused,1179619200,"05 20, 2007",2007,4243,"['MOVIE', 'summer', 'thirds', ""'ve"", 'had', 'Spider-Man', '3', 'so', 'far', 'running', 'biggest', 'disappointment', 'year', 'third', 'Pirates', 'film', 'coming', 'up', 'should', 'be', 'blast', 'have', 'Ocean', '13', 'Bourne', 'Ultimatum', 'rounding', 'out', 'group', 'thirds', 'monster', 'month', 'May', 'Shrek', 'Third', 'thankfully', 'have', 'first', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'summer', 'Fans', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'will', 'flock', 'one', 'great', 'anticipation', 'movie', 'treat', 'will', 'please', 'kids', 'adults', 'alike', 'unfortunately', 'movie', 'suffers', 'sequelitis', 'lost', 'steam.While', 'movie', 'not', 'as', 'fresh', 'first', 'two', 'offer', 'plenty', 'entertain', 'jokes', 'come', 'flying', 'fast', 'are', 'funny', 'lot', 'physical', 'comedy', 'guess', 'could', 'say', 'still', 'have', 'great', 'popular', 'culture', 'references', 'also', 'tons', 'humor', 'will', 'fly', 'right', 'younger', 'audience', 'make', 'experience', 'worthwhile', 'adults', 'saw', 'late', 'screening', 'basically', 'entire', 'audience', 'was', '17', 'older', 'place', 'was', 'laugh', 'factory', 'movie', 'even', 'got', 'applause', 'end', 'Jokes', 'Puss', 'saying', 'goodbye', 'many', 'lovers', 'having', 'line', 'are', 'royally', 'curse', 'word', 'being', 'blocked', 'foghorn', 'should', 'give', 'good', 'belly', 'laugh', 'fact', 'felt', 'movie', 'was', 'less', 'orientated', 'towards', 'kids', 'first', 'two', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'had', 'fair', 'share', 'farts', 'burps', 'installment', 'toned', 'back', 'only', 'kid', 'orientated', 'aspect', 'film', 'having', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'play', 'Arthur', 'heir', 'throne', 'Arthur', 'high', 'school', 'get', 'scene', 'what', 'school', 'life', 'would', 'be', 'world', 'Shrek', 'think', 'problem', 'people', 'will', 'have', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'characters', 'now', 'focus', 'story', 'Characters', 'Pinocchio', 'Gingy', 'serve', 'simply', 'cutaways', 'jokes', 'are', 'still', 'hilarious', 'lower', 'quality', 'film', 'when', 'stacked', 'up', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'before.The', 'biggest', 'difference', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'absence', 'director', 'Andrew', 'Adamson', 'who', 'made', 'start', 'first', 'two', 'Adamson', 'direction', 'was', 'superb', 'reason', 'why', 'first', 'two', 'are', 'just', 'great', 'comedic', 'family', 'films', 'busy', 'Narnia', 'empire', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'direct', 'Shrek', 'Third', 'Adamson', 'did', 'do', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'screenplay', 'result', 'notable', 'lack', 'structure', 'timing', 'jokes', 'story', 'whole', 'are', 'dropped', 'middle', 'everything', 'set', 'up', 'Alas', 'sequel', 'think', 'establishing', 'story', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'hurt', 'other', 'thing', 'had', 'problem', 'was', 'unbelievable', 'overuse', 'popular', 'songs', 'songs', 'felt', 'place', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'songs', 'not', 'enough', 'score', 'Harry', 'Gregson-Williams', 'been', 'part', 'franchise', 'beginning', 'returned', 'score', 'third', 'one', 'Andrew', 'Adamson', 'leaving', 'drown', 'out', 'score', 'completely', 'songs', 'Granted', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'see', 'movie', 'score', 'think', 'score', 'played', 'big', 'part', 'first', 'two', 'hardly', 'recall', 'noticing', 'most', 'time', 'around', 'Thankfully', 'will', 'be', 'getting', 'score', 'release', 'June', 'can', 'sit', 'aside', 'give', 'listen', 'then.ACTING', 'voice', 'department', 'everything', 'par', 'previous', 'two', 'actors', 'give', 'same', 'enthusiasm', 'characters', 'before', 'once', 'again', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'shines', 'Puss', 'Boots', 'Eric', 'Idle', 'probably', 'best', 'addition', 'cast', 'Merlin', 'wizard', 'Idle', 'Merlin', 'had', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'character', 'funniest', 'moments', 'film.BOTTON', 'LINE', 'bottom', 'line', 'here', 'Shrek', 'Third', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'two', 'still', 'better', 'most', 'animated', 'films', 'there', 'laughed', 'lot', 'found', 'be', 'worth', 'time', 'summer', 'fare', 'lack', 'focus', 'structure', 'overuse', 'popular', 'music', 'did', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'experience', 'do', 'think', 'when', 'change', 'directors', 'fact', 'difference', 'Go', 'see', 'Shrek', 'Third', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'was', 'certainly', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'Spider-Man', '3', 'sure']",N/A

1096564,AR3HV5WH2I4B2,B000UVKGPI,"Kristopher KR ""Um, yeah.""","[1, 2]","Shrek is one of the great film characters.  All too often it seems as if many reviewers saying they don't like this movie because it's 'lost some of it's charm.'I find that to be a complete copout.  If you didn't like it, then give true reasons why not.Shrek (Mike Myers)is one of the few film charcters who actually change and evolve through a trilogy of adventures.  But at the same time, he always keeps thos important to him closest to him.The same aspects of the adventures may not be in the third going around.  Perhaps the writers are simply running out of fairy tale characters to add into their whimsical tales.  True, perhaps the villians are not quite up to snuff compared to the great talent of Lord Farquaad himself (John Lithgow.) And admittedly some of the jokes are questionable.  However, the wonderful thing about these type of jokes is the kids don't truly understand them and they typically let it slide. (at least my kids do.)The plot simply involves Shrek being the next heir to the throne of Far Far Away.  At heart, though, he's just a simple ogre.  All he ever wanted to be was an ogre.  He learned in the first movie he's an ogre with heart.  So, to be true to his heart, and his true love, he decides to go on another journey to find the only OTHER heir, 'Artie' played suprisingly well by Justin Timberlake. (JustifiedAlong for the ride are friends [...] In Boots (Antonia Bandares) and Donkey (the great Eddie Murphy).  Of course, these two are more comic relief than anying, but they're more than willing to get their hands (or paws/hooves) dirty when they're truly needed.Their misson does involve thwarting bullies at a distant fantasy high school, convincing a whiny loser his rightful place in the world, and defeating the egomaniacal Prince Charming (played by Rupert Everett).What's great about the movie is the core of the entire story.  The lesson we all learn is the fact that the world changes, and we're powerless to stop it.  While Artie is intent on not becoming a king, Shrek is desperately nervous about an impending growing family.  Neither of these things is controlable, but life finds a way to help us cope.Overall, I think the movie was quite funny.  It is entertaining not only for myself, but my family as well.  In the end, isn't that what truly makes a good film?",4,It was decent.,1179619200,"05 20, 2007",2007,2317,"['Shrek', 'one', 'great', 'film', 'characters', 'too', 'often', 'many', 'reviewers', 'saying', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'charm', 'find', 'be', 'complete', 'copout', 'did', ""n't"", 'then', 'give', 'true', 'reasons', 'why', 'not.Shrek', 'Mike', 'Myers', 'one', 'few', 'film', 'charcters', 'who', 'actually', 'change', 'evolve', 'trilogy', 'adventures', 'same', 'time', 'always', 'thos', 'important', 'closest', 'him.The', 'same', 'aspects', 'adventures', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'third', 'going', 'around', 'Perhaps', 'writers', 'are', 'simply', 'running', 'fairy', 'tale', 'characters', 'add', 'whimsical', 'tales', 'True', 'perhaps', 'villians', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'snuff', 'compared', 'great', 'talent', 'Lord', 'Farquaad', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'admittedly', 'jokes', 'are', 'questionable', 'However', 'wonderful', 'thing', 'type', 'jokes', 'kids', 'do', ""n't"", 'truly', 'understand', 'typically', 'let', 'slide', 'least', 'kids', 'do', 'plot', 'simply', 'Shrek', 'being', 'next', 'heir', 'throne', 'Far', 'Far', 'Away', 'heart', 'though', 'just', 'simple', 'ogre', 'ever', 'wanted', 'be', 'was', 'ogre', 'learned', 'first', 'movie', 'ogre', 'heart', 'So', 'be', 'true', 'heart', 'true', 'love', 'go', 'journey', 'find', 'only', 'OTHER', 'heir', ""'Artie"", 'played', 'suprisingly', 'well', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'JustifiedAlong', 'ride', 'are', 'friends', '[', ']', 'Boots', 'Antonia', 'Bandares', 'Donkey', 'great', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'course', 'two', 'are', 'more', 'comic', 'relief', 'anying', ""'re"", 'more', 'willing', 'get', 'hands', 'paws/hooves', 'dirty', 'when', ""'re"", 'truly', 'needed.Their', 'misson', 'involve', 'thwarting', 'bullies', 'distant', 'fantasy', 'high', 'school', 'convincing', 'whiny', 'loser', 'rightful', 'place', 'world', 'defeating', 'egomaniacal', 'Prince', 'Charming', 'played', 'Rupert', 'Everett', '.What', 'great', 'movie', 'core', 'entire', 'story', 'lesson', 'learn', 'fact', 'world', 'changes', ""'re"", 'powerless', 'stop', 'Artie', 'intent', 'not', 'becoming', 'king', 'Shrek', 'desperately', 'nervous', 'impending', 'growing', 'family', 'things', 'controlable', 'life', 'way', 'help', 'cope.Overall', 'think', 'movie', 'was', 'quite', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'not', 'only', 'family', 'as', 'well', 'end', ""n't"", 'what', 'truly', 'good', 'film']",N/A

All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the animation does come ALIVE)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs.  The film is simple enough, but does a great job of describing people's every day lives and the problems they face.  It just goes to show that simplicity is often far better than complexity, when trying to present issues of a human nature.The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the HUMOR (!!!) and the music (!) are all wonderful!In short, Shrek the Third is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!Strongly recommended along with the previous two Shrek movies, the Ice Age movies, Antz, The Ant Bully, Cars, Flushed Away, Hoodwinked, Madagascar, Monsters Inc. and Over the Hedge.",5,EXCELLENT MOVIE!

Uncompelling story that missed a huge opportunity for new satire.  Rather than rehash Prince Charming and have him storm the city of Far Far Away and then have Shrek's people storm it again (I think that castle's been stormed three times in two movies!), how about making the movie a spoof of the whole King Arthur mythology?  That would have been fun.  And what's funny and sad is that when I watched the storyboarded ""deleted scenes"" in the special features, they were more funny than most of the stuff in the movie!!2.  Too dark and violent for too long.  A lot of the movie just wasn't fun at all.3.  Crass use of popular music sound bytes.  One of the fun things about Shrek movies is the use of popular music tunes, and they were used very effectively in the first two movies.  But why did I have to hear ""Live and Let Die"" for a frog's funeral?  Or Heart's ""Barracuda"" when the gals storm the castle?  These loud heavy handed old rock tunes just switch in and out of the movie like someone is back there flipping the ""time for the popular"" tune switch, no matter if it really helps the story or not.4.  Really really lame DVD menus.  I kept watching the DVD main menu screen waiting for something fun to happen, and it never did!5.  And, you know something went wrong when there's no commentary track on the DVD.  At least I couldn't find one.So, aside from the sheer escapism of Shrek, and a few good gags, like Gingy's life flashback, this was like someone just took leftover Shrek stuff out of the back of the fridge and cooked something up.

Shrek's really trying to handle things correctly, but he always makes a mess of things.Unfotunately, King Harold croaks.  But before he does, he tells Shrek that Fiona isn't the only heir to the throne.  She has a distant cousin, Arthur (Justin Timberlake), who could become king.  Since Shrek wants to return to the swamp and give up life in the palace, he sets off with his faithful friends Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Puss In Boots (Antonio Banderas) to find the heir.Meanwhile, Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) has been reduced to acting in bad dinner theater.  After one especially bad performance, he decides to take what he feels is rightfully his.  So he enlists the aid of every fairy tale villain he can find.  This time, they are going to get their happily ever after.  Will his plan succeed?  Can Shrek find Arthur?Like the first two, Shrek the Third is a funny film.  There is still plenty of the bathroom humor that was present in the first two, but the double meanings and suggestion jokes seemed to be gone.  Frankly, I was thankful for this.  Yet there was still plenty of satire for the adults to laugh at.  In fact, I think I heard more adults laughing then kids in the packed theater when I first saw it.All the previous main and minor characters are back, plus a plethora of new friends.  We've got King Arthur and assorted other Arthurian characters for starters.  Plus Fiona is visited by Snow White, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, and Rapunzel. And having Prince Charming team up with the other villains was brilliant.  Frankly, this is the film HAPPILY N'EVER AFTER wished it could be.  Yet the story is still fast moving with a good moral.  Yes, we're still talking about self-acceptance, but they find a fresh take on it that ties in with the first two.A word of warning about the death scene.  It is long and drawn out.  While played for laughs (and it is pretty funny), it might be too much for some kids.  Granted, it is a frog, but it also is Fiona's father.  Every child is different, so you know best how your will react.  But consider that before they watch.I've spent most of the review praising the film.  I really did enjoy it.  But I did feel it wasn't as funny as the first two.  While there were still plenty of laughs and satire, some of the bite was gone.  It's good, but it doesn't live up to the other two.  And, with all the characters, some got short changed.

However, the plot is just average and it didn't really hold my attention the way I hoped it would. I think after this Dreamworks needs to move on to new develop new characters in new films; but only time will tell if Dreamworks wants to milk this theme yet again. The voiceovers are very well done and the DVD has a plethora of extras.When the action begins, Shrek (Mike Myers) and his wife Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) are filling in for the ailing King Harold (John Cleese). Unfortunately, King Harold passes away and, with his dying wish, names Shrek as the rightful heir to the throne. This doesn't sit too well with Shrek who has been suffering from public relations embarrassment to public relations embarrassment as he launches ships with such strength that the ship blows a hole and sinks--and more. King Harold says, just before he dies, that the only other heir to the throne would be a young man at school named Arthur (Justin Timberlake). Immediately after the funeral for King Harold, Shrek, Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Puss-in-boots (Antonio Banderas) set sail to find Arthur at school. Things go downhill even more when Artie (as Arthur is called) is ambivalent at best to become a king; and it's up to Shrek and his buddies to convince Arthur to become king.Of course, things back in Far, Far Away Land aren't much better. Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) and his cronies take over the kingdom and imprison Fiona and her friends including Fiona's mother. Things look pretty bleak.Of course, the plot can go anywhere from here. (Yes, I know, you've read the spoilers by now but I won't give them away anyway.) Will Fiona and the other women be able to break free and fight the evil Prince Charming? How does Shrek react when he finds out he's becoming a father? What happens to Puss-in-boots and Donkey when an old wizard accidentally casts a spell on them so that they are trapped in each other's bodies? Watch the movie and find out!The DVD extras are very extensive. The commentary is great; and I like the bonus feature that includes a man going through a storyboard of a deleted scene at the school where Arthur is standing on line to get his lunch. There are funny ""suggestions"" from Donkey, Shrek and other characters as to how to deal with the problems of parenthood; and there are web links as well.Overall, this is a good effort and a movie to watch when a better one is unavailable. However, Shrek fans will love this movie. This is best suited for families with kids that are at least 8 or 9 years old because of some crude humor that you wouldn't want younger kids to experience.",4,a good film--but not great and not as good as the first two were (three and one half stars),1213401600,"06 14, 2008",2008,2693,"['Shrek', 'Third', 'good', 'movie', 'incredible', 'animation', 'marvel', 'animation', 'However', 'plot', 'just', 'average', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'hold', 'attention', 'way', 'hoped', 'would', 'think', 'Dreamworks', 'move', 'new', 'develop', 'new', 'characters', 'new', 'films', 'only', 'time', 'will', 'tell', 'Dreamworks', 'milk', 'theme', 'yet', 'again', 'voiceovers', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'DVD', 'plethora', 'extras.When', 'action', 'Shrek', 'Mike', 'Myers', 'wife', 'Princess', 'Fiona', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'are', 'filling', 'ailing', 'King', 'Harold', 'John', 'Cleese', 'Unfortunately', 'King', 'Harold', 'away', 'dying', 'wish', 'names', 'Shrek', 'rightful', 'heir', 'throne', ""n't"", 'sit', 'too', 'well', 'Shrek', 'who', 'been', 'suffering', 'public', 'relations', 'embarrassment', 'public', 'relations', 'embarrassment', 'ships', 'such', 'strength', 'ship', 'hole', 'sinks', 'more', 'King', 'Harold', 'just', 'only', 'other', 'heir', 'throne', 'would', 'be', 'young', 'man', 'school', 'named', 'Arthur', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'Immediately', 'funeral', 'King', 'Harold', 'Shrek', 'Donkey', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'Puss-in-boots', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'set', 'sail', 'find', 'Arthur', 'school', 'Things', 'go', 'downhill', 'even', 'more', 'when', 'Artie', 'Arthur', 'called', 'ambivalent', 'best', 'become', 'king', 'up', 'Shrek', 'buddies', 'convince', 'Arthur', 'become', 'king.Of', 'course', 'things', 'back', 'Far', 'Far', 'Away', 'Land', 'are', ""n't"", 'much', 'better', 'Prince', 'Charming', 'Rupert', 'Everett', 'cronies', 'take', 'kingdom', 'imprison', 'Fiona', 'friends', 'including', 'Fiona', 'mother', 'Things', 'look', 'pretty', 'bleak.Of', 'course', 'plot', 'can', 'go', 'anywhere', 'here', 'Yes', 'know', ""'ve"", 'read', 'spoilers', 'now', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'anyway', 'Will', 'Fiona', 'other', 'women', 'be', 'able', 'break', 'free', 'fight', 'evil', 'Prince', 'Charming', 'How', 'Shrek', 'react', 'when', 'out', 'becoming', 'father', 'What', 'Puss-in-boots', 'Donkey', 'when', 'old', 'wizard', 'accidentally', 'spell', 'so', 'are', 'trapped', 'other', 'bodies', 'Watch', 'movie', 'find', 'out', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'very', 'extensive', 'commentary', 'great', 'like', 'bonus', 'feature', 'man', 'going', 'storyboard', 'deleted', 'scene', 'school', 'where', 'Arthur', 'standing', 'line', 'get', 'lunch', 'are', 'funny', 'suggestions', 'Donkey', 'Shrek', 'other', 'characters', 'how', 'deal', 'problems', 'parenthood', 'are', 'web', 'links', 'well.Overall', 'good', 'effort', 'movie', 'watch', 'when', 'better', 'one', 'unavailable', 'However', 'Shrek', 'fans', 'will', 'love', 'movie', 'best', 'suited', 'families', 'kids', 'are', 'least', '8', '9', 'years', 'old', 'crude', 'humor', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'younger', 'kids', 'experience']",N/A

1096586,A1U360OMVQRPUB,B000UVKGPI,Mel Odom,"[2, 3]","SHREK THE THIRD offers some interesting crossroads for our favorite green ogre (Michael Myers). With Fiona's (Cameron Diaz) frog father on his deathbed, Shrek has had to serve as king of Far Far Away in the interim.  And uneasy lies the crown.  We have some knee-slapping good times watching Shrek to his level-best to be the king to the people, but even an ogre with a good heart just isn't cut out to be the king.  He messes up nearly everything he dies, and he stinks at being the king.  Shrek is the first to admit this.Thankfully, Eddie Murphy is back as Donkey and Antonio Banderas returns as Puss In Boots. The movie just wouldn't have been the same without them. Their constant bickering and commentary helped move that plot and the characters along quickly. Plus they got some of the funniest lines in the movie.Prince Charming returns as the villain in this one. The opener showing him working dinner theater in a low level pub is just hilarious. The effort so fits the character, and so does all the grief he takes at the hands of the audience. Of course, he's trying to exorcize his demons by starring in a play where he triumphs over Shrek, which is what he thinks he should have done in the first place.Then, and I'm going to use a line here that was painfully obvious in the movie that was never used, Fiona's father croaks (he's a frog, remember?). But before he does, actually after several false alarms, he tells Shrek that there is one other heir to the kingdom of Far Far Away: a young boy named Arthur.Shrek resolves to go find Arthur and crown the boy king. All Shrek wants to do, all Shrek ever wants to do, is get back to his beloved swamp and get on with sharing his life with Fiona. But when he boards the ship to begin his voyage, Fiona tells him she is pregnant. It's all too much for Shrek. The nightmare he has about having ogre children is absolutely side-splitting. Not only that, but the movie double dips on the whole nightmare premise and caught me flat-footed on one of the quick twists.In the meantime, back in the heart of villainy, Prince Charming retreats to a pub where all the evil characters in the fairy tales hang out and begrudge their existence. The scene where Charming rallies the troops really works. I was ready to vote for him myself.After that, we're treated to a series of eye-popping adventures as Shrek goes back to high school to get Artie, which is how Arthur is known among his peers. Shrek also discovers that Arthur is the much-maligned prey of the school bullies and butt of all practical jokes. No one likes him.With nothing there to stay for, Arthur decides to join Shrek and go back to be the king. Along the way Shrek ends up playing the father role to Arthur, which could have been predicted but still played well.With the end of the movie in sight, everything is up for grabs. The visual comedy in the combat scenes is amazing. The twists and turns the plot makes as it follows a much-trod path are brilliant. It's the little things in the Shrek films that add up to big laughs.  Like the pay-for-play window Pinocchio dances in while Shrek is trying to get information about the location of Fiona. Like Arthur throwing himself on the ground and crying his eyes out to get Merlin to help them get home. Like Donkey, while possessed by Puss In Boots, when he tries to make all his fur stand on end like a cat. Like Donkey's kids when they spelled out the smoke message that tells him they love him.One of the best things to come out of left field, and there were several, was Fiona's speech to the princesses of Far Far Away to rally them into a combat force. Sleeping Beauty's attack on the tree guards at the gate to the city is simply amazing, and I found myself lifting my jaw off the floor and laughing out loud. Music is so much a part of the Shrek movies, and there's plenty of it on the soundtrack.I always go see the Shrek movies on the big screen, and I have a hard time waiting for the DVD release so I can watch them again. Despite my attention to the screen, there's always something I miss. Plus so many of the laughs can be enjoyed over and over. Like the Gingerbread Man's Six Million Dollar Man run through the fields. I can't wait for the DVD, and I can't wait to see if there will be - hopefully - a SHREK 4.",4,Another Solid Entry To A Great Series,1182988800,"06 28, 2007",2007,4294,"['SHREK', 'THE', 'THIRD', 'interesting', 'crossroads', 'favorite', 'green', 'ogre', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'Fiona', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'frog', 'father', 'deathbed', 'Shrek', 'had', 'serve', 'king', 'Far', 'Far', 'Away', 'interim', 'uneasy', 'crown', 'have', 'knee-slapping', 'good', 'times', 'watching', 'Shrek', 'level-best', 'be', 'king', 'people', 'even', 'ogre', 'good', 'heart', 'just', ""n't"", 'cut', 'out', 'be', 'king', 'up', 'nearly', 'everything', 'being', 'king', 'Shrek', 'first', 'admit', 'this.Thankfully', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'back', 'Donkey', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'Puss', 'Boots', 'movie', 'just', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'same', 'constant', 'bickering', 'commentary', 'helped', 'move', 'plot', 'characters', 'quickly', 'got', 'funniest', 'lines', 'movie.Prince', 'Charming', 'villain', 'one', 'opener', 'showing', 'working', 'dinner', 'theater', 'low', 'level', 'pub', 'just', 'hilarious', 'effort', 'so', 'character', 'so', 'grief', 'hands', 'audience', 'course', 'trying', 'exorcize', 'demons', 'starring', 'play', 'where', 'Shrek', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'first', 'place.Then', ""'m"", 'going', 'use', 'line', 'here', 'was', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'movie', 'was', 'never', 'used', 'Fiona', 'father', 'croaks', 'frog', 'remember', 'actually', 'several', 'false', 'alarms', 'one', 'other', 'heir', 'kingdom', 'Far', 'Far', 'Away', 'young', 'boy', 'named', 'Arthur.Shrek', 'go', 'find', 'Arthur', 'crown', 'boy', 'king', 'Shrek', 'do', 'Shrek', 'ever', 'do', 'get', 'back', 'beloved', 'swamp', 'get', 'sharing', 'life', 'Fiona', 'when', 'boards', 'ship', 'begin', 'voyage', 'Fiona', 'pregnant', 'too', 'much', 'Shrek', 'nightmare', 'having', 'ogre', 'children', 'absolutely', 'side-splitting', 'Not', 'only', 'movie', 'double', 'dips', 'whole', 'nightmare', 'premise', 'caught', 'flat-footed', 'one', 'quick', 'twists.In', 'meantime', 'back', 'heart', 'villainy', 'Prince', 'Charming', 'retreats', 'pub', 'where', 'evil', 'characters', 'fairy', 'tales', 'hang', 'out', 'begrudge', 'existence', 'scene', 'where', 'Charming', 'troops', 'really', 'was', 'ready', 'vote', 'myself.After', ""'re"", 'treated', 'series', 'eye-popping', 'adventures', 'Shrek', 'back', 'high', 'school', 'get', 'Artie', 'how', 'Arthur', 'known', 'peers', 'Shrek', 'also', 'Arthur', 'much-maligned', 'prey', 'school', 'bullies', 'butt', 'practical', 'jokes', 'one', 'him.With', 'nothing', 'there', 'stay', 'Arthur', 'join', 'Shrek', 'go', 'back', 'be', 'king', 'way', 'Shrek', 'up', 'playing', 'father', 'role', 'Arthur', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'predicted', 'still', 'played', 'well.With', 'end', 'movie', 'sight', 'everything', 'up', 'grabs', 'visual', 'comedy', 'combat', 'scenes', 'amazing', 'twists', 'plot', 'much-trod', 'path', 'are', 'brilliant', 'little', 'things', 'Shrek', 'films', 'add', 'up', 'big', 'laughs', 'pay-for-play', 'window', 'Pinocchio', 'dances', 'Shrek', 'trying', 'get', 'information', 'location', 'Fiona', 'Arthur', 'throwing', 'ground', 'crying', 'eyes', 'out', 'get', 'Merlin', 'help', 'get', 'home', 'Donkey', 'possessed', 'Puss', 'Boots', 'when', 'make', 'fur', 'stand', 'end', 'cat', 'Donkey', 'kids', 'when', 'spelled', 'out', 'smoke', 'message', 'love', 'him.One', 'best', 'things', 'come', 'left', 'field', 'were', 'several', 'was', 'Fiona', 'speech', 'princesses', 'Far', 'Far', 'Away', 'rally', 'combat', 'force', 'Sleeping', 'Beauty', 'attack', 'tree', 'guards', 'gate', 'city', 'simply', 'amazing', 'found', 'lifting', 'jaw', 'floor', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'Music', 'so', 'much', 'part', 'Shrek', 'movies', 'plenty', 'soundtrack.I', 'always', 'go', 'see', 'Shrek', 'movies', 'big', 'screen', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'waiting', 'DVD', 'release', 'so', 'can', 'watch', 'again', 'attention', 'screen', 'always', 'something', 'miss', 'so', 'many', 'laughs', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'over', 'Gingerbread', 'Man', 'Six', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Man', 'run', 'fields', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'DVD', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'will', 'be', 'hopefully', 'SHREK', '4']",N/A

King Harold is on his death bed and is nearly ready to croak. He informs Shrek (who does not want to be king) that there is one other, Arthur (Pendragon). Shrek, Donkey and Puss In Boots set off to retrieve Arthur. As the ship leaves, Fiona tells Shrek that she is pregnant. Shrek does look forward to being a father. He is worried that he would be a bad role model. The trio arrives at Worcestershire Academy where Arthur is a student. He is a sixteen year old kid who's from the school bullies to the class nerds taunt Arthur. Shrek tell Artie (as he likes to be called) that he is the new king of Far Far Away. At first Artie is excited about being king. On the ship Donkey and Puss In Boots start talking about the responsibilities of being king and Artie begins to have second thoughts. Artie tries to turn the ship. Shrek and Artie are now in a battle of the ship wheel and during the struggle the wheel breaks and the ship crash on some rocks. Shrek, Donkey, Puss In Boots, and Artie make it to shore. The foursome find the home of Merlin; a retired wizard from Artie old school. Meanwhile Prince Charming and all of the evil characters hatch a plot to take over Far Far Away. Prince Charming and the gang capture Fiona, Queen Lilian, Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, Doris the Ugly Stepsister, and Cinderella. Prince Charming finds out through one of the three little pigs that Arthur is the next in line and Shrek went to get him. Prince Charming sends Captain Hook and some thugs to kill Shrek, Donkey, and Puss In Boots and bring back Arthur. Captain Hook and the thugs fail and Merlin cast a spell that would send all four of them back to Far Far Away. When they arrive at Far Far Away. Donkey is inside Puss In Boots body and Puss In Boots is in Donkey's body. The four make it back to the castle and Shrek finds his way to Prince Charming and is about to clobber him, however, Prince Charming is able to call for his men and capture Shrek. Shrek manages to trick Prince Charming to take him and let Artie go. Shrek, Donkey, and Puss In Boots are thrown in the tower. Prince Charming plans to kill Shrek in a play tonight. Queen Lilian literally butts her head against a couple walls so the folks in the tower can escape. Once free the princess, Donkey, and Puss In Boots make plans to win back Far Far Away and save Shrek. At the theater Prince Charming is at the part in the play where he is about to kill Shrek until troops arrive and are about to save him until Prince Charming summing his thugs and captures the rescuers. Just as about Prince Charming is about to slew Shrek, Arthur arrives and reason with the villains to turn over a new leaf. The villains lay down their weapons and release the captives.

Zwick,"[5, 8]","It would be safe to say that the third time is definitely NOT the charm when it comes to the ""Shrek"" series, since ""Shrek the Third"" lacks virtually all the imaginativeness, wit and magic that made the previous two installments such tremendous fun for young and old viewers alike.  In this latest go-round, the writers have clearly run out of comical inspiration, leaving us with a humorless farrago of labored jokes and sappy life-lessons (mainly about the joys of prospective fatherhood and the importance of being willing to take a chance in life) guaranteed to please no target audience or age group whatsoever.In this edition, Shrek's father-in-law, the frog king of the realm of Far Far Away, bequeaths his crown to Shrek on his deathbed unless the reluctant ogre can find a distant heir (the young Arthur) to take his place.  Shrek, filled with doubts about his own ability to rule the kingdom, heads off with his faithful companions, Donkey and Puss In Boots, to find the boy and bring him back to the castle where he will assume his rightful place on the throne.  Meanwhile, the vain, conniving Prince Charming has decided to enlist the aid of all the villains of the kingdom to mount a coup and proclaim himself king of the land.As I reckon them, there are about five hearty laughs in ""Shrek the Third,"" and at least four of them come in the opening scene of the film (a very funny parody of third-rate dinner theater).  Unfortunately, it's all pretty much downhill from there, as one ostensibly comic line after another crashes and burns, leaving us with little but the gorgeous backdrops and seamless animation to hold our attention.  Regarding the latter point, it must be stated that movie animators have certainly come a long way in perfecting the facial expressions of their characters, but what is the point of such a technological advancement if it is placed in the service of as dismal a script as Andrew Adams, Howard Gould, Jeffrey Price, Peter S. Seaman, J. David Stern, David N. Weiss, and Jon Zack have concocted here?  Somehow, you know you're in trouble when no fewer than seven writers have a hand in a screenplay, but couldn't at least one of them have come up with a funny joke or two while they were hammering it all out?  Moreover, the story itself is dull and plodding and even the ""Shrek"" trademark of piling on clever pop culture references falls flat in this instance (and having Medieval teenagers blabbing away in already-dated Valley Girl lingo just doesn't cut it).Eddie Murphy and Antonio Banderas still provide yeoman service as the voices of Donkey and Puss In Boots, respectively, but even they can't keep the whole enterprise from feeling as if blockbuster rigor mortis has set in.  Unlike the two earlier films in the series, ""Shrek the Third"" feels less the product of a magic spell than of a divine curse.",2,Shrek dreck,1179619200,"05 20, 2007",2007,2852,"['would', 'be', 'safe', 'say', 'third', 'time', 'definitely', 'NOT', 'charm', 'when', 'Shrek', 'series', 'Shrek', 'Third', 'virtually', 'imaginativeness', 'wit', 'magic', 'made', 'previous', 'two', 'installments', 'such', 'tremendous', 'fun', 'young', 'old', 'viewers', 'alike', 'latest', 'go-round', 'writers', 'have', 'clearly', 'run', 'comical', 'inspiration', 'leaving', 'humorless', 'farrago', 'labored', 'jokes', 'sappy', 'life-lessons', 'mainly', 'joys', 'prospective', 'fatherhood', 'importance', 'being', 'willing', 'take', 'chance', 'life', 'guaranteed', 'please', 'target', 'audience', 'age', 'group', 'whatsoever.In', 'edition', 'Shrek', 'father-in-law', 'frog', 'king', 'realm', 'Far', 'Far', 'Away', 'bequeaths', 'crown', 'Shrek', 'deathbed', 'reluctant', 'ogre', 'can', 'find', 'distant', 'heir', 'young', 'Arthur', 'take', 'place', 'Shrek', 'filled', 'doubts', 'own', 'ability', 'rule', 'kingdom', 'heads', 'off', 'faithful', 'companions', 'Donkey', 'Puss', 'Boots', 'find', 'boy', 'bring', 'back', 'castle', 'where', 'will', 'assume', 'rightful', 'place', 'throne', 'Meanwhile', 'vain', 'conniving', 'Prince', 'Charming', 'decided', 'enlist', 'aid', 'villains', 'kingdom', 'mount', 'coup', 'proclaim', 'king', 'land.As', 'reckon', 'are', 'five', 'hearty', 'Shrek', 'Third', 'least', 'four', 'come', 'opening', 'scene', 'film', 'very', 'funny', 'parody', 'third-rate', 'dinner', 'theater', 'Unfortunately', 'pretty', 'much', 'downhill', 'there', 'one', 'ostensibly', 'comic', 'line', 'crashes', 'burns', 'leaving', 'little', 'gorgeous', 'backdrops', 'seamless', 'animation', 'hold', 'attention', 'Regarding', 'latter', 'point', 'must', 'be', 'stated', 'movie', 'animators', 'have', 'certainly', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'perfecting', 'facial', 'expressions', 'characters', 'what', 'point', 'such', 'technological', 'advancement', 'placed', 'service', 'dismal', 'script', 'Andrew', 'Adams', 'Howard', 'Gould', 'Jeffrey', 'Price', 'Peter', 'S.', 'Seaman', 'J.', 'David', 'Stern', 'David', 'N.', 'Weiss', 'Jon', 'Zack', 'have', 'concocted', 'here', 'Somehow', 'know', ""'re"", 'trouble', 'when', 'fewer', 'seven', 'writers', 'have', 'hand', 'screenplay', 'could', ""n't"", 'least', 'one', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'funny', 'joke', 'two', 'were', 'hammering', 'out', 'Moreover', 'story', 'dull', 'plodding', 'even', 'Shrek', 'trademark', 'piling', 'clever', 'pop', 'culture', 'references', 'flat', 'instance', 'having', 'Medieval', 'teenagers', 'blabbing', 'away', 'already-dated', 'Valley', 'Girl', 'lingo', 'just', ""n't"", 'cut', 'Murphy', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'still', 'provide', 'yeoman', 'service', 'voices', 'Donkey', 'Puss', 'Boots', 'respectively', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'whole', 'enterprise', 'feeling', 'blockbuster', 'rigor', 'mortis', 'set', 'two', 'earlier', 'films', 'series', 'Shrek', 'Third', 'less', 'product', 'magic', 'spell', 'divine', 'curse']",N/A

The quality of this series has been slowly sliding, and even though this movie is OK, I am at a point at which I would not recommend it. There are still some sparks of clever humor and an efficient use of satire at certain times, but there are portions of the film that come close to putting the audience to sleep. Overall, I would have to say that this production shows an uneven quality throughout its duration, and that it is reaching that point commonly known for series as jump-the-shark.This time around, the story deals with filling the position of king of Far Far Away. The Frog King, while in his deathbed, asks Shrek to do this, together with Fiona, but the ogre could not be less interested. Thus, he goes on a quest to find Arthur, Fiona's cousin, to take the hot seat. Meanwhile, Prince Charming is plotting, together with every villain that ever existed in a fairy tale, to overthrow the current government and take possession of the throne. Ohh! I almost forgot; there is the small issue of the pregnancy!As mentioned before, there are some segments in which the satiric elements make us laugh and keep us entertained, especially when Shrek visits Arthur's high school. The music is also pretty good, as has been characteristic of the series, but it is definitely not at the level of the first movie.

There is also the side story of Fiona's pregnancy and Shrek's hesitancy in ruling the kingdom is mirrored in his hesitancy in becoming a father.The characters are still voiced by the star cast we have come to love, as well as the addition of Justin Timberlake as Arthur.  The animation is also very good, as we have come to expect, and whilst other animated films have caught up to Shrek in their quality, this film still manages to do it very well indeed.The fairy tale `in jokes' are also prevalent and whilst they still raise a smile, they have mostly been exhausted and can't make you laugh throughout like the first two films did.  In fact this may be the key element that I mentioned is missing, originality.

1096628,ASR6EDD3ES7JW,B000UVKGPI,SteakSalad101,"[12, 15]","I got out of classes this fine Friday for some special school occasion, so the entire middle school went over to the movie theater to see Shrek The Third at a discovered matin&eacute;e showtime at the local theater. A week ago, when the faculty first announced we'd be seeing this instead of Spider-Man 3, I was pretty excited. I mean, come on, it's Shrek--you really can't go wrong with the charming, funny, brainy-as-hell movies coming out of Dreamworks, with voice talent by Eddie Murphey, Mike Myers, and Cameron Diaz...right? Wrong. Let's start by examining what Shrek The Third DIDN'T have. The first ""Shrek"" was loved by me--and pretty much every other Shrek fan who is mature enough to understand its witty humour, special heartwarming touch, and its meant-for-adults-that-goes-way-over-little-kids'-heads type content. The filmmakers of the first Shrek really had some awesome material up their sleeves--stuff that truly made a fantastic movie, and if I do say so myself, one of the best animated films ever to be pumped out of LA.The second Shrek, ""Shrek 2,"" was a slight decline in entertainment. It was still funny, and still had half a tank of movie magic gasoline--not a full tank like the first Shrek possessed, but half--good enough to make a decent and enjoyable film, but not nearly enough to quite match up to the original.And now, sure enough, as every successful movie must have, a second sequel. ""Shrek The Third"" is a complete and utter mess. Remember those special little tricks the filmmakers had up their sleeves for the first Shrek, and even some for the second Shrek? Well, they're all GONE--not missing, no, they're completely GONE. What made the first two movies enjoyable for me had completely been used up, proving to us moviegoers and critics that sequels to big blockbusters are gigantic wastes of money.Sure, it was FUNNY. It was really funny, I laughed a lot. But where was the brain behind the comedy? Where was the backbone, the spine, the rock where instead of St. Peter builds the Church, where the filmmaker is supposed to base the movie on, where was that? It wasn't there--it was like the filmmakers pretended it was there, when it really wasn't, and just ignored that fact and continued to make the movie with no worries. A ""ghost comedy"" I like to call it. Now I know what you're asking yourself--how could I enjoy a ""ghost comedy"" like ""Anchorman,"" but not this? Well, this leaves me into my next point.The direction of the movie was an embarrassingly bad joke. It was like the director was sitting back smoking bongs and drinking Guinness while the sound editors filled in for him. The story didn't flow like the first two, it wasn't interesting, and after a while, I just got bored with the whole thing and started thinking about other, more important aspects of my life. The storyline felt like the film caterer used a knife to chop up it into little bits of segments and then mixed them around, making the movie almost as pointless as ""Larry The Cable Guy: Health Inspector."" A stupid comedy that is directed well can be a VERY FUNNY AND ENJOYABLE FILM. But when it's not? The essence of the film drains away to leave just empty-hearted and hollow laughs that don't mean anything.AND THE ENDING! OH GOD, THE ENDING! What were they thinking?! I was pretty much asleep! They tried to make it funny and give the audience the warm fuzzy feeling they felt in the first two movies, and they failed miserably! It was almost like they tried to justify the crappiness of the rest of the movie with a satisfying finale, and ended up doing the opposite and making the rest of the movie even crappier than it was. Which is truly saying something.Overall, ""Shrek The Third"" got me out of class, and that really was the only good part about seeing it. A huge, and unfortunate, disappointment. Save your money and rent the first two. I hope there's no ""Shrek The Fourth.""",2,"A funny movie that is lacking something monstrously important to be a true ""Shrek"" film",1179446400,"05 18, 2007",2007,3906,"['got', 'classes', 'fine', 'Friday', 'special', 'school', 'occasion', 'entire', 'middle', 'school', 'went', 'movie', 'theater', 'see', 'Shrek', 'Third', 'discovered', 'matin', 'eacute', 'showtime', 'local', 'theater', 'week', 'ago', 'when', 'faculty', 'first', 'announced', ""'d"", 'be', 'seeing', 'instead', 'Spider-Man', '3', 'was', 'pretty', 'excited', 'mean', 'come', 'Shrek', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'charming', 'funny', 'brainy-as-hell', 'movies', 'coming', 'Dreamworks', 'voice', 'talent', 'Eddie', 'Murphey', 'Mike', 'Myers', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'right', 'Wrong', 'Let', 'start', 'examining', 'what', 'Shrek', 'Third', 'DID', ""N'T"", 'have', 'first', 'Shrek', 'was', 'loved', 'pretty', 'much', 'other', 'Shrek', 'fan', 'who', 'mature', 'enough', 'understand', 'witty', 'humour', 'special', 'heartwarming', 'touch', ""meant-for-adults-that-goes-way-over-little-kids'-heads"", 'type', 'content', 'filmmakers', 'first', 'Shrek', 'really', 'had', 'awesome', 'material', 'up', 'sleeves', 'stuff', 'truly', 'made', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'do', 'say', 'so', 'one', 'best', 'animated', 'films', 'ever', 'be', 'pumped', 'LA.The', 'second', 'Shrek', 'Shrek', '2', 'was', 'slight', 'decline', 'entertainment', 'was', 'still', 'funny', 'still', 'had', 'tank', 'movie', 'magic', 'gasoline', 'not', 'full', 'tank', 'first', 'Shrek', 'possessed', 'half', 'good', 'enough', 'make', 'decent', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'not', 'nearly', 'enough', 'quite', 'match', 'up', 'original.And', 'now', 'sure', 'enough', 'successful', 'movie', 'must', 'have', 'second', 'sequel', 'Shrek', 'Third', 'complete', 'utter', 'mess', 'Remember', 'special', 'little', 'tricks', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'up', 'sleeves', 'first', 'Shrek', 'even', 'second', 'Shrek', 'Well', ""'re"", 'GONE', 'not', 'missing', ""'re"", 'completely', 'GONE', 'What', 'made', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'enjoyable', 'had', 'completely', 'been', 'used', 'up', 'proving', 'moviegoers', 'critics', 'sequels', 'big', 'blockbusters', 'are', 'gigantic', 'wastes', 'money.Sure', 'was', 'FUNNY', 'was', 'really', 'funny', 'laughed', 'lot', 'where', 'was', 'brain', 'comedy', 'Where', 'was', 'backbone', 'spine', 'rock', 'where', 'instead', 'St.', 'Peter', 'Church', 'where', 'filmmaker', 'supposed', 'base', 'movie', 'where', 'was', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'was', 'filmmakers', 'pretended', 'was', 'there', 'when', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'ignored', 'fact', 'continued', 'make', 'movie', 'worries', 'ghost', 'comedy', 'like', 'call', 'Now', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'asking', 'how', 'could', 'enjoy', 'ghost', 'comedy', 'Anchorman', 'not', 'Well', 'next', 'point.The', 'direction', 'movie', 'was', 'embarrassingly', 'bad', 'joke', 'was', 'director', 'was', 'sitting', 'back', 'smoking', 'bongs', 'drinking', 'Guinness', 'sound', 'editors', 'filled', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'flow', 'first', 'two', 'was', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'while', 'just', 'got', 'bored', 'whole', 'thing', 'started', 'thinking', 'other', 'more', 'important', 'aspects', 'life', 'storyline', 'felt', 'film', 'caterer', 'used', 'knife', 'chop', 'up', 'little', 'bits', 'segments', 'then', 'mixed', 'around', 'making', 'movie', 'almost', 'as', 'pointless', 'Larry', 'Cable', 'Guy', 'Health', 'Inspector', 'stupid', 'comedy', 'directed', 'well', 'can', 'be', 'VERY', 'FUNNY', 'AND', 'ENJOYABLE', 'FILM', 'when', 'not', 'essence', 'film', 'away', 'leave', 'just', 'empty-hearted', 'hollow', 'laughs', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'anything.AND', 'THE', 'ENDING', 'OH', 'GOD', 'THE', 'ENDING', 'What', 'were', 'thinking', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'asleep', 'tried', 'make', 'funny', 'give', 'audience', 'warm', 'fuzzy', 'feeling', 'felt', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'failed', 'miserably', 'was', 'almost', 'tried', 'justify', 'crappiness', 'rest', 'movie', 'satisfying', 'finale', 'ended', 'up', 'doing', 'opposite', 'making', 'rest', 'movie', 'even', 'crappier', 'was', 'Which', 'truly', 'saying', 'something.Overall', 'Shrek', 'Third', 'got', 'class', 'really', 'was', 'only', 'good', 'part', 'seeing', 'huge', 'unfortunate', 'disappointment', 'Save', 'money', 'rent', 'first', 'two', 'hope', 'Shrek', 'Fourth']",N/A

I remember Mike Myers having to go on tour to promote this film and not only did he seem to cringe trying to explain it or talk about, he very clearly seemed depressed about it.Like so many others have said, the allure of the original film has long since vanished and leaves this current offering from Dreamworks as probably the worst movie they've ever made.Recently, I realized how much my son loved the original Shrek movie when he kept bringing me the DVD case in the afternoon and pointing at the TV wanting to watch it. He laughed during the silly parts, clapped during and after the fight scenes and danced during all the songs. Twenty minutes into the third installment, he turned away, left the room and wanted nothing to do with it. I turned it off and he went back to coloring. About an hour later, out of curiosity, I put the original Shrek back in the DVD and he was stuck to it - once more - clapping, laughing and dancing until the very end where he danced to the 'Swamp Party Karaoke' scene.I guess the message is this: Shrek isn't a played out concept at all. Shrek is very endearing and a lovable character. He always will be. I actually like Donkey the best. But the people in charge of this project forgot who this film was supposed to be targeted at and thus have been left with a real stinker.The sad thing is that we will probably see Shrek 4 sometime soon, and they'll be trying to hammer home more of this adult-driven nonsense.",1,"Shrek sadly jumps a shark tank ...

With the exception of a rare few like Jurassic Park III, The Godfather III, Spider-Man 3, and most likely Pirates 3, it's hard to be original on the third go-around and even harder to sustain our interest.  It may be of some fun, and Shrek 3 is to some degree; however, it has lost much of its charm and often feels strained and contrived.  The first 30 minutes of Shrek the Third is sensationally funny as we see a series of bloopers with him trying to do kingly duties; however, the story is substantially slower in the last two thirds and often unfunny.I had my opinion, but I wanted to know what my kids, ages 10 and 14, to whom this film is mostly aimed at thought of this film without any bias from me and my son said, ""It was alright, but seemed to drop dead after the first half,"" and my daughter said, ""It was okay, but not nearly as good as the first two.

SHREK THE THIRD carries on the good hearted fractured fairy tale themes of its predecessors but the misunderstood ogre gimmick is beginning to wear a bit thin.  Shrek and Fiona still make a sweet couple and Puss (Antonio Bandaras) and Donkey (Eddie Murphy) continue to play their parts as amusing sidekicks well.  The scenes at the medieval high school where Shrek and Company pick up the future King Arthur (Justin Timberlake) who is a bit of a teenage dweeb are quite amusing.  However some of the scenes such as at the villain tavern just seem so ""busy"" with ideas and characters that the viewer can't absorb it all.  I also didn't care for Fiona's fairy tale princess friends who get imprisoned and then escape with her and her mom (Julie Andrews) back in Far Far Away.  I did like the pop songs used on the soundtrack and the animation is stunning from beginning to end.  As in the other SHREK films there is an important message that all should believe in  themselves though young viewers might be a bit confused by Shrek's fear of becoming a father which is happily resolved by the film's ending.

On HD DVD viewers should be impressed with the beautiful picture, nice bright colors and excellent detail on the animation and this disc doesn't disappoint at all. Prince Charming's hair flows in various directions, shadows and lighting throughout show great attention to detail by the animators/rendering team, etc.Story wise this was, as most critics seemed to point out, probably the weakest of the 3 movies, but not bad. If the first two movies hadn't set the bar so high, this one would have been better received, but a lot of the sight gags and inside jokes have been done in the first two movies, so you aren't as shocked and don't react as well this time.  (Note that there is one great sequence with the Gingerbread man {Gingy} that is almost worth the price of the disc by itself.)  Be aware that this film is also somewhat darker at longer periods of time (story wise) than in the first two movies.I have some questions about the extras that are available for this movie, as I'm curious if the web enabled updates will (as they should) add content over time for this title.  For example, my wife was looking for a segment of the Puss-in-boots dance similar to the Donkey dance segment that is available in the extras/web content.  If that sort of content is made available later, then the web enabled updates features will prove to be quite valuable for a movie like this.Worth the purchase price to me, but I suspect this one is more likely a rental for many viewers. I would love to see it packaged up as the Shrek Trilogy so that I could get the first two movies in HD (I have both on DVD, first movie on two disc DVD I think).

Sequels seldom outperform the original, but Shrek 2 did pretty well.  Unfortunately Shrek the Third, lacked the charmingness of the first two movies.  Justin Timberlake voicing ""Artie"" as the only newcomer, was good enough, but I couldn't help the fact this movie was about ""Artie"" and not Shrek.  In this new installment, Shrek & Fiona become the servants of vengeful Prince Charming.  They also welcome a new addition to their Ogre family.  Artie is Fiona's cousin who is next in line to a reluctant ""King"" Shrek.  Artie is the typical ""high school outcast"" in most teen flicks, that ends up winning, at least in this movie ""a kingdom"".

1096639,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000UVKGPI,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[1, 1]","Shrek (Mike Myers) and Fiona (Cameron Diaz) are filling in for the ailing Frog King (John Cleese), Fiona's father and leader of Far, Far Away. Yes, Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Puss (Antonio Banderas) are around to provide support and to help them adapt to the routine of acting as monarchy, but they are both uncomfortable in this new role. When Shrek learns of a cousin who could become the new ruler, he sets off on a journey to bring Artie (Justin Timberlake) back from Worcestshire High School. Just as he leaves, Fiona lets him know that she is pregnant and this leads to Shrek having some nightmares during the journey. Prince Charming (Rupert Everett), now an actor playing himself in dinner theater, learns of the possible shift in leadership and rounds up all of the other villains to help him take over Far, Far Away enlisting Captain Hook (Ian McShane), the Wicked Witch, Gepetto and Rumplestiltskin, among others, to help out. They attack the castle just as Fiona is having a baby shower with the other princesses, including Snow White (Amy Poehler, TV's ""Saturday Night Live""), Sleeping Beauty (Cheri Oteri, TV's ""Saturday Night Live""), Cinderella (Amy Sedaris, TV's ""Strangers with Candy""), Rapunzel (Maya Rudolph, TV's ""Saturday Night Live"") and her mother, the Queen (Julie Andrews). Shrek finds Artie, a teenager who is the butt of all the other kid's jokes including the dashing Lancelot (John Krasinski, TV's ""The Office""), but convinces him to return to Far, Far Away. But the journey takes too long and they pay a visit to Merlin (Eric Idle), who has been bitten by the self-empowerment bug and only wants people to find their inner self.The key to any memorable animated film is if it manages to keep the adults entertained at the same time. Those adults have to bring the tots to the theater, why shouldn't they have some fun. The films that manage to capture this formula will remain in our consciousness for decades because the kids will continue to watch them as they grow up and show them to their kids. The first two films managed to do this, employing very good computer animation with enough jokes for the kids and the adults.""Shrek the Third"", the newest entry from DreamWorks, follows the same formula as the previous two films, but only employs about half the jokes. Half the jokes make it less funny and less memorable. ""Third"" proves that not all threes are a charm. Don't get me wrong. It is an okay film, just nowhere near as good as the previous two films. This is definitely a franchise of diminishing returns.All of the great voice talent returns. Mike Myers, who I don't believe has done anything since the last ""Shrek"" film, returns as the ogre from the swamp who is now married to Fiona and must try to fit into the role of a Royal, for her sake. He has difficulty, but keeps trying because he knows how important it is for Fiona, his wife and true love. When he finds out she is pregnant, he begins to have nightmares of rearing children, afraid of how his life will change. But this seems like a rather tame outing for Myers. There is only one moment when he is given any latitude to create something resembling `ad lib ` and these jokes are pretty dated. Throughout, he merely reacts to the other characters, providing little laughter of his own.Cameron Diaz returns as Fiona, the princess who is also an ogre and the love of Shrek's life. For much of the film, she is in a dungeon or surrounded by other characters, played by funnier actresses, merely highlighting the lack of laughs Fiona creates and the lack of character Diaz is able to create. She may be pretty, but she isn't a very memorable voice actor.Eddie Murphy returns as Donkey, Shrek's sidekick. He is amusing and provides some laughs. He and Dragon have married and have children, strange donkey-dragon kids who fly around and set things on fire. Donkey always pops up and says the wrong thing at the wrong time. That's his shtick and it wears a little thin. Antonio Banderas returns as Puss, the best addition from ""Shrek 2"", who now serves as an advisor to Shrek. He has a few opportunities to make us laugh. I'm not really revealing anything by telling you that Donkey and Puss switch bodies during the course of the story (this is revealed in the trailer) and this leads to a few laughs.Ruper Everett plays Charming and has clearly let his quest for the throne take him around the bend. Now, reduced to playing himself in dinner theater, he seeks revenge and will stop at nothing to get it.John Cleese and Julie Andrews return as the King and Queen. Both add the necessary stateliness to their characters, and Cleese manages to add some humor to his role, but these moments are short-lived.Eric Idle is the best new addition to this film. He plays Merlin, a Merlin who appears to have been to one too many Robert Bly pow-wows or perhaps taken one too many mushrooms. He combines some mystical mumbo jumbo, new age-y, touchy feely perspectives to our stereotypical view of the wizard adding some truly twisted comical moments.The rest of the major additions really don't add a lot of memorable moments to the film. Justin Timberlake plays Artie, or Arthur, the cousin of the King and the teenager Shrek desperately seeks to take over the throne. We recognize it is Timberlake's voice, but he doesn't add anything to the role another actor couldn't have done. Moreover, there are zero laughs from the character. The funniest part of this character is watching how the filmmakers have adapted the high school memories of our nightmares into the medieval, storybook setting. John Krasinski, from ""The Office"", plays Lancelot, Artie's main rival at Worcestshire High, and the character is a welcome addition, but Krasinski doesn't add anything spectacular to the role either. You never say ""Oh, that's John Krasinski"", as we have with Eddie Murphy, Antonio Banderas or Mike Myers. Ian McShane, from ""Deadwood"", plays Captain Hook, and the role is funny, but again, we don't get anything particularly memorable from McShane's performance. Hook likes to play the piano, so he brings one with him everywhere he goes, including when he is supposed to be leading a fight against our heroes. It is an amusing, but never fully explored joke and character trait.The problem with ""Shrek the Third"" is that it just isn't that funny. Yes, there are some funny moments at the high school and in a scene when Charming attempts to create a play that will both make him a star and the king, but the film has long stretches with no laughs. The first two films featured fast-paced, laugh a minute segments that left us laughing and wanting more. ""Third"" just leaves us wanting more.The first two films included many, many funny pop culture references, a practice that seems to have been almost completely abandoned. Far, Far Away looks a lot like downtown Beverly Hills complete with chain stores and the films have had a lot of fun creating medieval versions of ""Starbucks"" and ""Footlocker"", to name just a few. These moments are almost non-existent in this entry. A quick pan across Far, Far Away shows the same chains and a brief shot of a logo on a box provides a quick laugh, but these jokes are almost expected. Why didn't the filmmakers take a few moments to include them and help to make them more memorable?Hopefully, ""Shrek 4"", which has already been announced, will return the film to its roots, the laughter and the greatness of the first two entries.",3,2 1/2 - Not Only Merlin is Having Trouble With The Magic,1179878400,"05 23, 2007",2007,7455,"['Shrek', 'Mike', 'Myers', 'Fiona', 'Cameron',

1096643,A2U80IPZXN5V1U,B000UVKGPI,Tommy Sixx Morais,"[2, 2]","Shrek turned out to be a an unexpected hit when it was released in 2001 and expanding on the succes of the first one Dreamworks studio ultimatly made a sequel,the simply titled Shrek 2 wich was not only better at the box office than the previous but also better as a movie.Shrek The Third,the second sequel is somewhat lacking what the previous two movies in the franchise had,orginality.Yet it stills manages to keep young and old fans satisfied,as there is still plenty of the same humor that made the other Shrek films so good.I was pretty sure they could never top Shrek 2 and this third movie didn't.The plot and humor sadly aren't as good as they could and should have been,even if some parts are funny like Pinocchio and Gingerbread Man's parts.The plot for this third movie in the Shrek series,is with the death of Fiona's father King Harold,the king of Far Far Away,Shrek becomes the next king.The thing is he doesn't accept that responsability so he goes on quest to recruit the perfect king.His choice settles on a young boy named Arthur but before he can bring him to his throne,Far Far Away is being invaded by Prince Charming who beleves HE must be king and an army of villains.The execution of the script to the big screen was rather average,nothing really special except a thing or two that was funny but i think that after this rather disapointing third movie Shrek has miles ahead if they want to recover their former glory.For Dreamworks its pretty much ""Well,as long as it gets us cash"" situation but they should pay closer attention to Shrek 4 cause if that one turns out like the third things are going to get bad.The visuals are one thing that they have actually done better than Shrek 1 and 2.They look stunning for a 3D movie and can only get better in future Shrek movies,its good that they stuck with the same kind of visuals as well.Still i can't deny that i was disapointed when i walked out of the Movie Theather,it just wasn't the same thing than with the first two.Those where magical,histerical movies,filled with great moments that i still remember today.With this third instalment of the series i can't say it sucked but i can't say it was that great either.That said its still satisfying but just not up to par with the first two films in terms of appreciation.The soundtrack remains great as the others with some classic and new songs,notably Led Zeppelin's classic ""Immigrant Song"" wich was played during a part of the movie's commercial.Its nice that despite everything they still have the orginal voice actors after all that time.Have anyone else noticed how the camera is less on Shrek,Donkey and Puss than in previous movies?It also seems to be aimed at a younger audience than the first two,its more fart jokes and such.As a mature person i would have to stick with my rating and opinion and give it a three,if it is rated for a kid movie then it would get a five,if you have kids by all means buy it for them they will have a great time.Lets hope for the next Shrek movies they turn out better than ""Shrek The Third"".",3,"""Where Did The Magic Go?""",1203465600,"02

He quickly realizes that he's just doesn't have what it takes to be a king. After all, he is an ogre.  When he learns of another relative in line for the throne, Shrek sets out with Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Puss In Boots (Antonio Banderas) to find the long lost heir, Arthur (Justin Timberlake).  While Shrek is gone, Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) forms an army of evil doers and overtakes the city.  Fiona (Cameron Diaz) and her friends fight back, so that all is chaos by the time Shrek returns.I really enjoyed SHREK. I was even more impressed by SHREK 2 and in some ways think it is a superior movie to the original.  I was really looking forward to seeing SHREK THE THIRD and seeing how creative the filmmakers would get bringing together the fairy tale world of Shrek and the legends of King Arthur.I was severely disappointed to find that they chose not to be creative.  The plot of the movie is interesting enough, but the execution is horrible.  For instance, take the character of Merlin.  Instead of making him into a strong ally who could help Shrek and Artie, he's portrayed as a bumbling teacher of magic who was fired from Artie's school.  He can't remember his spells and seems to struggle with narcolepsy.  That idea of Merlin seems funny on paper, but it just doesn't work on screen.  Or take Prince Charming.  In SHREK 2 he was portrayed as the chosen heir to marry Fiona, raised by Fairy Godmother and groomed to be the perfect King.  In this installment he's downgraded to being a bad actor re-enacting Shrek's defeat of Fairy Godmother.  Charming should be a great fighter and warrior, but instead he's portrayed as being a wimp who decides he will get his revenge by having a huge play where he literally kills Shrek on stage.  Then there's the last five minutes of the movie.  I won't say what it involves, but the musical montage completely ruins the tone of the rest of the movie.That's not to say the movie doesn't have some good moments.  I really enjoyed the medieval take on high school.  I also really enjoyed the princesses' revolt.  Still, there just wasn't enough good stuff to make up for the bad.Children will like SHREK THE THIRD and it is worth watching if you've seen the first two SHREK films.  However, if you're looking for the same style, humor, and tone that made the first two SHREK movies such a joy to watch, you won't find it here.",3,The Third Time Isn't Charming Enough.,1186963200,"08 13, 2007",2007,2515,"['When', 'King', 'Harold', 'John', 'Cleese', 'ill', 'eventually', 'croaks', 'Shrek', 'Mike', 'Myers', 'duties', 'King', 'Far', 'Far', 'Away', 'quickly', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'what', 'be', 'king', 'ogre', 'When', 'relative', 'line', 'throne', 'Shrek', 'out', 'Donkey', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'Puss', 'Boots', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'find', 'long', 'lost', 'heir', 'Arthur', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'Shrek', 'gone', 'Prince', 'Charming', 'Rupert', 'Everett', 'army', 'evil', 'doers', 'city', 'Fiona', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'friends', 'fight', 'back', 'chaos', 'time', 'Shrek', 'returns.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'SHREK', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'impressed', 'SHREK', '2', 'ways', 'think', 'superior', 'movie', 'original', 'was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'SHREK', 'THE', 'THIRD', 'seeing', 'how', 'creative', 'filmmakers', 'would', 'get', 'bringing', 'together', 'fairy', 'tale', 'world', 'Shrek', 'legends', 'King', 'Arthur.I', 'was', 'severely', 'disappointed', 'find', 'chose', 'not', 'be', 'creative', 'plot', 'movie', 'interesting', 'enough', 'execution', 'horrible', 'instance', 'take', 'character', 'Merlin', 'Instead', 'making', 'strong', 'ally', 'who', 'could', 'help', 'Shrek', 'Artie', 'portrayed', 'bumbling', 'teacher', 'magic', 'who', 'was', 'fired', 'Artie', 'school', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'spells', 'struggle', 'narcolepsy', 'idea', 'Merlin', 'funny', 'paper', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'screen', 'take', 'Prince', 'Charming', 'SHREK', '2', 'was', 'portrayed', 'chosen', 'heir', 'marry', 'Fiona', 'raised', 'Fairy', 'Godmother', 'groomed', 'be', 'perfect', 'King', 'installment', 'downgraded', 'being', 'bad', 'actor', 're-enacting', 'Shrek', 'defeat', 'Fairy', 'Godmother', 'Charming', 'should', 'be', 'great', 'fighter', 'warrior', 'instead', 'portrayed', 'being', 'wimp', 'who', 'will', 'get', 'revenge', 'having', 'huge', 'play', 'where', 'literally', 'Shrek', 'stage', 'Then', 'last', 'five', 'minutes', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'what', 'musical', 'montage', 'completely', 'tone', 'rest', 'movie.That', 'not', 'say', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'good', 'moments', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'medieval', 'take', 'high', 'school', 'also', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'princesses', 'revolt', 'Still', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'good', 'stuff', 'make', 'up', 'bad.Children', 'will', 'like', 'SHREK', 'THE', 'THIRD', 'worth', 'watching', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'first', 'two', 'SHREK', 'films', 'However', ""'re"", 'looking', 'same', 'style', 'humor', 'tone', 'made', 'first', 'two', 'SHREK', 'movies', 'joy', 'watch', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'here']",N/A
