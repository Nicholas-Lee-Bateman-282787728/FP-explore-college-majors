1376415,A2MBOX3TNBCBV6,B003YKYX9M,"M. Payne ""M. Payne""","[16, 16]","This is the story of the struggle of the wife of Bill W. (one of the founders of AA) After he got sober and began his AA work, she discovered she also needed to recover from the effects of the disease of alcoholism, and founded a separate but related program, called Al-Anon.  Al-Anon is not for alcoholics, its for the friends & family of alcoholics.  Her story is truly inspirational and as an Al-Anon myself, I enjoy watching this at least once a year.  It is estimated that every alcoholic/addict severely effects at least 4 other persons with their addiction, Al-Anon helps these people recover, as AA helps the alcoholic.",5,I Liked It,1364947200,"04 3, 2013",2013,627,"['story', 'struggle', 'wife', 'Bill', 'W.', 'one', 'founders', 'AA', 'got', 'sober', 'began', 'AA', 'work', 'discovered', 'also', 'needed', 'recover', 'effects', 'disease', 'alcoholism', 'founded', 'separate', 'related', 'program', 'called', 'Al-Anon', 'Al-Anon', 'not', 'alcoholics', 'friends', 'family', 'alcoholics', 'story', 'truly', 'inspirational', 'Al-Anon', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'least', 'once', 'year', 'estimated', 'alcoholic/addict', 'severely', 'effects', 'least', '4', 'other', 'persons', 'addiction', 'Al-Anon', 'people', 'recover', 'AA', 'alcoholic']",When Love Is Not Enough: The Lois Wilson Story

I really can't figure out why Lois stayed with the whole thing with all her other options in life.  Winona Ryder is superb.

1376417,A3JTBJC5WSEZ7Q,B003YKYX9M,Thomas M. Sipos,"[1, 2]","This past decade has not been good to Winona Ryder.  I loved LOST SOULS (2000), but critics didn't.  After that Ryder appeared in the dreadful AUTUMN IN NEW YORK, and there followed many awful indie films and unfunny comedies, with Ryder often cast in small roles as an unlikeable, nasty, or crazy woman (SEX AND DEATH 101, THE TEN, THE INFORMERS).  Although THE PRIVATE LIVES OF PIPPA LEE was a decent film, once again, Ryder had a small role as the nasty Crazy Girl.WHEN LOVE IS NOT ENOUGH returns Ryder to her 1990s screen persona of a smart, strong, idealistic, independent yet devoted woman.  Her Lois Wilson character in this film resembles Ryder characters from 1969, BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA, and LITTLE WOMEN.The story is engaging.  I don't normally like these &#34;disease of the week&#34; films, but WHEN LOVE IS NOT ENOUGH maintained my interest, partially because it was based on a true story, its set decor effectively recreated its 1917-1950s period setting, and because the rest of the cast and crew also did a great job.  (Although I mostly got this because I've been a Ryder fan ever since I saw LOST SOULS.)Ryder did a great job as a Crazy Girl in GIRL, INTERRUPTED, but since then she's been too often typecast as The Crazy.  I've not seen BLACK SWAN (I normally wait for the DVD), but I hear Ryder plays another Crazy.I hope WHEN LOVE IS NOT ENOUGH, rather than BLACK SWAN, will inspire her future roles.  I think most Ryder fans would prefer to see her in more of the former than the latter.",5,best Winona Ryder film in a decade,1382313600,"10 21, 2013",2013,1510,"['past', 'decade', 'not', 'been', 'good', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'loved', 'LOST', 'SOULS', '2000', 'critics', 'did', ""n't"", 'Ryder', 'appeared', 'dreadful', 'AUTUMN', 'IN', 'NEW', 'YORK', 'there', 'followed', 'many', 'awful', 'indie', 'films', 'unfunny', 'comedies', 'Ryder', 'often', 'cast', 'small', 'roles', 'unlikeable', 'nasty', 'crazy', 'woman', 'SEX', 'AND', 'DEATH', '101', 'THE', 'TEN', 'THE', 'INFORMERS', 'THE', 'PRIVATE', 'LIVES', 'OF', 'PIPPA', 'LEE', 'was', 'decent', 'film', 'once', 'again', 'Ryder', 'had', 'small', 'role', 'nasty', 'Crazy', 'Girl.WHEN', 'LOVE', 'IS', 'NOT', 'ENOUGH', 'Ryder', '1990s', 'screen', 'persona', 'smart', 'strong', 'idealistic', 'independent', 'yet', 'devoted', 'woman', 'Lois', 'Wilson', 'character', 'film', 'Ryder', 'characters', '1969', 'BRAM', 'STOKER', 'DRACULA', 'LITTLE', 'WOMEN.The', 'story', 'engaging', 'do', ""n't"", 'normally', '34', 'disease', 'week', '34', 'films', 'WHEN', 'LOVE', 'IS', 'NOT', 'ENOUGH', 'maintained', 'interest', 'partially', 'was', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'set', 'decor', 'effectively', 'recreated', '1917-1950s', 'period', 'setting', 'rest', 'cast', 'crew', 'also', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'mostly', 'got', ""'ve"", 'been', 'Ryder', 'fan', 'ever', 'saw', 'LOST', 'SOULS', 'Ryder', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'Crazy', 'Girl', 'GIRL', 'INTERRUPTED', 'then', 'been', 'too', 'often', 'typecast', 'Crazy', ""'ve"", 'not', 'seen', 'BLACK', 'SWAN', 'normally', 'wait', 'DVD', 'hear', 'Ryder', 'Crazy.I', 'hope', 'WHEN', 'LOVE', 'IS', 'NOT', 'ENOUGH', 'rather', 'BLACK', 'SWAN', 'will', 'inspire', 'future', 'roles', 'think', 'most', 'Ryder', 'fans', 'would', 'prefer', 'see', 'more', 'former', 'latter']",When Love Is Not Enough: The Lois Wilson Story
