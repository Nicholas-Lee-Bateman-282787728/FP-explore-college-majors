Wilson ""Christmas Lover""","[1, 1]","Every single year around Christmas, The Hallmark Channel, ABC Family, Lifetime and some other Cable channels put out a plethora of movies and unfortunately only a few of them tend to really be something special...and this is one of them.  I do lower the bar when it comes to some of the TV Holiday movies only because I take into account that they are not multi million dollar masterpieces with all of the latest stars and this really puts things onto a more level playing field.  With that being said, this was really a heart warming Christmas movie which had all the pieces of a perfect Holiday movie.  I felt that the main actress was incredibly believable in her love of Christmas and also was very good at playing the type of naive, childlike character they were looking for.  Basically, Annie is the daughter of Santa Claus and as she is getting older she is wanting to ""test the waters"" of the world.  Before she agrees to stay at the North Pole and in the family business for the rest of her life, she chooses to come stateside and live as 'one of us.'  This sets up the main premise, while we are then introduced to the standard good looking guy who falls in love with her but is afraid to say something, the evil handsome man who has ulterior motives but also has her heart (for the time) and the friendly neighbors that live next to her at the Christmasy hotel she is living at.  Truly though, it all works and comes together to be a heartfelt Christmas movie and I highly suggest both young and old taking out some time of their hectic lives to enjoy some innocent and true Christmas spirit!",5,One of the select few 'Made for TV' movies that hits the mark...,1355011200,"12 9, 2012",2012,1603,"['single', 'year', 'Christmas', 'Hallmark', 'Channel', 'ABC', 'Family', 'Lifetime', 'other', 'Cable', 'channels', 'put', 'out', 'plethora', 'movies', 'unfortunately', 'only', 'few', 'tend', 'really', 'be', 'something', 'special', 'one', 'do', 'lower', 'bar', 'when', 'TV', 'Holiday', 'movies', 'only', 'take', 'account', 'are', 'not', 'multi', 'million', 'dollar', 'masterpieces', 'latest', 'stars', 'really', 'things', 'more', 'level', 'playing', 'field', 'being', 'said', 'was', 'really', 'heart', 'warming', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'had', 'pieces', 'perfect', 'Holiday', 'movie', 'felt', 'main', 'actress', 'was', 'incredibly', 'believable', 'love', 'Christmas', 'also', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'playing', 'type', 'naive', 'childlike', 'character', 'were', 'looking', 'Basically', 'Annie', 'daughter', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'getting', 'older', 'wanting', 'test', 'waters', 'world', 'stay', 'North', 'Pole', 'family', 'business', 'rest', 'life', 'come', 'stateside', 'live', ""'one"", 'up', 'main', 'premise', 'are', 'then', 'introduced', 'standard', 'good', 'looking', 'guy', 'who', 'love', 'afraid', 'say', 'something', 'evil', 'handsome', 'man', 'who', 'ulterior', 'motives', 'also', 'heart', 'time', 'friendly', 'neighbors', 'live', 'next', 'Christmasy', 'hotel', 'living', 'Truly', 'works', 'together', 'be', 'heartfelt', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'highly', 'suggest', 'young', 'old', 'taking', 'out', 'time', 'hectic', 'lives', 'enjoy', 'innocent', 'true', 'Christmas', 'spirit']",N/A

If you hang around long enough, the network will air a gem or two. Not that I'm saying this movie is a gem. ANNIE CLAUS IS COMING TO TOWN has got some bothersome bits. Still, stash this on that pile of holiday DVDs with repeat watchability.Even Pollyanna thinks Annie Claus needs a hard dose of reality knocked into her. Annie (Maria Thayer) fair gushes over with Christmas exuberance. The time has come for the daughter of Santa and Mrs. Claus to embark on a sabbatical. While away, Annie is expected to experience the world before she commits to running the family business. Fate sends her to Los Angeles, home to shattered hopes and rude awakenings. In Los Angeles Annie's sort of unbounded cheer is greeted with a drive-by drink thrown into her face.Who knew that dissension rocked the fabled toy shop at the North pole? The conniving head elf Chester (Matt Winston) makes a bid for power by hiring a weasely actor (Ryan Bittle) to distract Annie in LA. Because if Annie falls in love and chooses not to go back to the North Pole, then Chester is next in line to run Christmas. Santa needs to expand his naughty list.In Los Angeles, Annie Claus has reserved a room at the seedy Candy Cane Inn and promptly befriends the street-savvy motel proprietor (Vivica A. Fox) and her young daughter (Nay Nay Kirby). When the little girl's school pageant is canceled because the director is going away, Annie volunteers to direct the show. Tracking a flyer to its source Annie walks into Wonderland Toys, a shabby old-fashioned toy store about to go out of business. Annie offers to work for free to help get the toy shop in the black. Annie is as impetuous as she is enthusiastic. Maria Thayer's performance sometimes borders on the manic (For instance, there's her over-the-top reaction when she learns that a kid doesn't think Santa Claus is real).Meanwhile, the head elf's ambitions seem about to be realized. Annie has fallen in love with that actor, never mind that the owner (Sam Page) of Wonderland Toys secretly pines for her. Will the real world sink its hooks into Annie? Will it destroy her Christmas spirit? ANNIE CLAUS IS COMING TO TOWN is a cute, feel-good family film. The clich&eacute;s do come fast and often, and maybe Maria Thayer could've toned it down some, because a more subtle performance would've resonated with the viewer on a deeper emotional level.

1554272,A2GZVA22WYG95I,B008IG0FT4,J. Olsen,"[25, 26]","Annie Klaus, Santa's daughter, is going on sabbatical. She gets one month, between Thanksgiving and Christmas, to experience the outside world and decide if that is where she belongs, or if she should return home and run the ""family business"". The toss of a holly laden dart at a spinning globe sends her on her adventure to Los Angeles. She stays at the Candy Cane Motel, which, according to the owner, isn't The Four Seasons, but it's clean and it's cheap. Annie is befriended by the owner, Lucy, and her daughter, Mia, and offers to direct Mia's Christmas pageant when the current director has to leave town to help an ailing relative. She also involves herself in the life of Ted, owner of Wonderland Toys. His business is struggling since the new superstore opened nearby. Annie sees one of his flyers and is enticed at the idea of a wonderland of toys. She has to see it, but is very disappointed at the dusty, lifeless displays in his store. She offers her help, free of charge, explaining that her family runs a very successful toy business back in Norpole, Idaho. She has come to LA to get away and see if she still wants to go back to take over the business after tasting what else the world has to offer. She tells Ted that she will be happy to work  in his store while she is in town, at no cost to him, because she is always happy around toys.In the meantime, there is trouble afoot. Unknown to Annie, one of her father's helpers is plotting to keep Annie away from the North Pole so that he will eventually be placed in charge. He has hired an unscrupulous, struggling actor to win Annie's heart and keep her in LA. Dean, the actor, poses as a successful lawyer with a soft spot in his heart for orphans. He is ever the gentleman and Annie is smitten, while Ted watches with heavy heart. But Dean can't pull the wool over everyone's eyes forever, and as Christmas draws near and Annie must make her decision, his cover starts to unravel.I would have liked to give this 3 1/2 stars. It is a cute, family-friendly movie with no inappropriate content. But there were just a few things I struggled with. At times Annie is just too giddy and perky for me. Her constant Pollyanna outlook and smile are enough, but when she giggles at everything in parts of the movie I wanted to turn down the ""cute"" meter just a little.I was also a bit confused by the Christmas pageant. Though it is never actually specified in dialogue (that I could catch) whether this takes place in a school or church, an outside shot of a building just before a rehearsal scene had a definite ""church"" look to it. So I expected a nativity-style pageant. I'm still not sure exactly what the pageant was about. You see the backdrop of ""North Pole"" type houses, with shepherds standing in front of them and what appears to be an angel (Mia) introducing Santa as ""Silent Night"" plays in the background. Go figure.There were a couple of other slight inconsistencies, but overall, it was a fun little Christmas fantasy that would work for an evening of holiday ""escape"" viewing. Annie is cute and definitely perky, Lucy is street-smart and sharp, Ted is cute and likable, and Dean is slimy, as all good villains should be. Don't expect this to top your list of holiday favorites, but it is something I would be willing to pull out and watch each Christmas.",4,North Pole girl hits the big city.,1349654400,"10 8, 2012",2012,3331,"['Annie', 'Klaus', 'Santa', 'daughter', 'going', 'sabbatical', 'one', 'month', 'Thanksgiving', 'Christmas', 'experience', 'outside', 'world', 'decide', 'where', 'should', 'return', 'home', 'run', 'family', 'business', 'toss', 'holly', 'laden', 'dart', 'spinning', 'globe', 'adventure', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Candy', 'Cane', 'Motel', 'according', 'owner', ""n't"", 'Four', 'Seasons', 'clean', 'cheap', 'Annie', 'befriended', 'owner', 'Lucy', 'daughter', 'Mia', 'direct', 'Mia', 'Christmas', 'pageant', 'when', 'current', 'director', 'leave', 'town', 'help', 'ailing', 'relative', 'also', 'life', 'Ted', 'owner', 'Wonderland', 'Toys', 'business', 'struggling', 'new', 'superstore', 'opened', 'nearby', 'Annie', 'one', 'flyers', 'enticed', 'idea', 'wonderland', 'toys', 'see', 'very', 'disappointed', 'dusty', 'lifeless', 'displays', 'store', 'help', 'free', 'charge', 'explaining', 'family', 'very', 'successful', 'toy', 'business', 'back', 'Norpole', 'Idaho', 'come', 'LA', 'get', 'away', 'see', 'still', 'go', 'back', 'take', 'over', 'business', 'tasting', 'what', 'else', 'world', 'offer', 'Ted', 'will', 'be', 'happy', 'work', 'store', 'town', 'cost', 'always', 'happy', 'meantime', 'trouble', 'afoot', 'Annie', 'one', 'father', 'helpers', 'plotting', 'keep', 'Annie', 'away', 'North', 'Pole', 'so', 'will', 'eventually', 'be', 'placed', 'charge', 'hired', 'unscrupulous', 'struggling', 'actor', 'win', 'Annie', 'heart', 'keep', 'LA', 'Dean', 'actor', 'successful', 'lawyer', 'soft', 'spot', 'heart', 'orphans', 'ever', 'gentleman', 'Annie', 'smitten', 'Ted', 'watches', 'heavy', 'heart', 'Dean', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pull', 'wool', 'everyone', 'eyes', 'forever', 'Christmas', 'draws', 'Annie', 'must', 'make', 'decision', 'cover', 'unravel.I', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'give', '3', '1/2', 'stars', 'cute', 'family-friendly', 'movie', 'inappropriate', 'content', 'were', 'just', 'few', 'things', 'struggled', 'times', 'Annie', 'just', 'too', 'giddy', 'perky', 'constant', 'Pollyanna', 'outlook', 'smile', 'are', 'enough', 'when', 'everything', 'parts', 'movie', 'wanted', 'turn', 'down', 'cute', 'meter', 'just', 'little.I', 'was', 'also', 'bit', 'confused', 'Christmas', 'pageant', 'never', 'actually', 'specified', 'dialogue', 'could', 'catch', 'place', 'school', 'church', 'outside', 'shot', 'building', 'just', 'rehearsal', 'scene', 'had', 'definite', 'church', 'look', 'So', 'expected', 'nativity-style', 'pageant', ""'m"", 'still', 'not', 'sure', 'exactly', 'what', 'pageant', 'was', 'about', 'see', 'backdrop', 'North', 'Pole', 'type', 'houses', 'shepherds', 'standing', 'front', 'what', 'be', 'angel', 'Mia', 'introducing', 'Santa', 'Silent', 'Night', 'background', 'Go', 'figure.There', 'were', 'couple', 'other', 'slight', 'inconsistencies', 'overall', 'was', 'fun', 'little', 'Christmas', 'fantasy', 'would', 'work', 'evening', 'holiday', 'escape', 'viewing', 'Annie', 'cute', 'definitely', 'perky', 'Lucy', 'street-smart', 'sharp', 'Ted', 'cute', 'likable', 'Dean', 'slimy', 'good', 'villains', 'should', 'be', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'top', 'list', 'holiday', 'favorites', 'something', 'would', 'be', 'willing', 'pull', 'out', 'watch', 'Christmas']",N/A

I was a huge fan of the Carol Burnett Show growing up and think Vicki looks exactly the same) to see if taking over the family business is really what she wants.

Annie, played by the adorable and perfectly cast Maria Thayer (who I researched after watching to see she has been in so many things I have seen before but had no idea while watching.) heads to California but has no idea that someone back home does not want her to come back and have devised a plan to keep her in Cali!Sweet movie with a great cast.
