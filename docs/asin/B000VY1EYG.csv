1105486,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000VY1EYG,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[9, 10]","It's hard not to resist the obvious metaphor that Adrienne Shelly's final work `Waitress' is a wonderful slice of life, but a film this rich deserves more than banal clich&eacute;s.  Nevertheless, the film is very satisfying from start to finish and is a must for anyone who wants to commiserate (soothing ginger pie) over the wounds of misogyny in an understandably jaded feminine existence.  Much like `Volver' in the sense that it is mainly a women's affair, the film has a power to satisfy anyone with a palette for well-made movies that are cleverly told and leave a lingering aftertaste.`The Waitress' is about, well.., a waitress.  Jenna (played true-to-life by Keri Russell, brimming with a wide range of emotion), has one passion in life:  making her pies.  With great pride she presents a host of different sweetmeats, each with its own distinctive ingredients and descriptive titles to mirror life.  Her great ambition is to enter her works in a ""United States Pie"" contest; one that would sustain her enough to get out from under her shackling existence with louse-spouse husband, Earl (Jeremy Sisto).  His insecurity manifests itself by cueing his reluctant wife to say and confess things she doesn't mean, and by jealously guarding money that may buy out aspects of independence in her existence.  (Their heated, one-way arguments set up for unseasoned rhubarb pie.)  Add to that the ingredient of an unwanted pregnancy, and we're set up with an intent attention to the details of Jenna's story.Most of the focus is at Joe's Pie Diner, the main outlet for her passion.  Here she finds friendship with two fellow waitresses who are looking for respite and romance in their own lives.  Becky (Shelly) finds sparks by answering personals ads; while spirited Dawn (Cheryl Hines) finds a side dish while caring for an invalid husband.  All their lives overlap one another, even with growling cook/manager, Cal, who barks out orders with unrelenting grouchiness.  They all share about the same misery and rejuvenation (including ""Falling in love [Mousse] pie"").  For all her trouble, Jenna gets some just desserts in her own life.  First of all, she musters up some sweetness for elderly diner owner, Joe (Andy Griffith), who can on a turn be scathingly ornery or genuinely sweet.  Next in line, is her obstetrician Dr. Jim Pomatter (Nathan Fillion), whom she resentfully notes has replaced her familiar female doctor.  He's from Connecticut and is in some ways out of place in their deep Southern community.  Nevertheless, he manages to tear down her jaundiced demeanor and provide a slice of sweet (potato) pie.The extra ingredients make 'The Waitress' special.  The sensual construction of fast-lapsed pies with Jenna's own narration is well-crafted, and the music makes each scene a symphony.  Earl brings foreboding music with jaggedly edited scenes.  Jenna and Jim provide classical music one notch lower than Tchycovsky's `Romeo and Juliet,' complete with spinning camera angles, and a fussy little toddler in the diner inspires the horror of Wagner.  Topped off with some great dialogue, including narrated letters to her unborn baby that work like an unbosoming soliloquy, and we have a movie of distinct perfection.(`The Waitress' reminded me of loose associations to other movies, including `Alice Doesn't Live Here Any More'Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymoreand `Terms of Endearment,'Terms of Endearmentbut these are only hints for the distinctive flavor of this movie.  Noting the nature of Adrienne Shelly`s tragic death, misfortune played an even worse role in her own life. )",4,A Woman's Life (Bitterroot and Honey) Pie,1182038400,"06 17, 2007",2007,3596,"['hard', 'not', 'resist', 'obvious', 'metaphor', 'Adrienne', 'Shelly', 'final', 'work', 'Waitress', 'wonderful', 'slice', 'life', 'film', 'rich', 'more', 'banal', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Nevertheless', 'film', 'very', 'satisfying', 'start', 'finish', 'must', 'anyone', 'who', 'commiserate', 'soothing', 'ginger', 'pie', 'wounds', 'misogyny', 'understandably', 'jaded', 'feminine', 'existence', 'Much', 'Volver', 'sense', 'mainly', 'women', 'affair', 'film', 'power', 'satisfy', 'anyone', 'palette', 'well-made', 'movies', 'are', 'cleverly', 'told', 'leave', 'lingering', 'aftertaste.', 'Waitress', 'well..', 'waitress', 'Jenna', 'played', 'true-to-life', 'Keri', 'Russell', 'brimming', 'wide', 'range', 'emotion', 'one', 'passion', 'life', 'making', 'pies', 'great', 'pride', 'host', 'different', 'sweetmeats', 'own', 'distinctive', 'ingredients', 'descriptive', 'titles', 'mirror', 'life', 'great', 'ambition', 'enter', 'works', 'United', 'States', 'Pie', 'contest', 'one', 'would', 'sustain', 'enough', 'get', 'out', 'shackling', 'existence', 'louse-spouse', 'husband', 'Earl', 'Jeremy', 'Sisto', 'insecurity', 'manifests', 'cueing', 'reluctant', 'wife', 'say', 'confess', 'things', ""n't"", 'mean', 'jealously', 'guarding', 'money', 'may', 'buy', 'out', 'aspects', 'independence', 'existence', 'heated', 'one-way', 'arguments', 'set', 'up', 'unseasoned', 'rhubarb', 'pie', 'Add', 'ingredient', 'unwanted', 'pregnancy', ""'re"", 'set', 'up', 'intent', 'attention', 'details', 'Jenna', 'story.Most', 'focus', 'Joe', 'Pie', 'Diner', 'main', 'outlet', 'passion', 'Here', 'friendship', 'two', 'fellow', 'waitresses', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'respite', 'romance', 'own', 'lives', 'Becky', 'Shelly', 'sparks', 'answering', 'personals', 'ads', 'spirited', 'Dawn', 'Cheryl', 'Hines', 'side', 'dish', 'caring', 'invalid', 'husband', 'lives', 'overlap', 'one', 'even', 'growling', 'cook/manager', 'Cal', 'who', 'out', 'orders', 'unrelenting', 'grouchiness', 'share', 'same', 'misery', 'rejuvenation', 'including', 'Falling', 'love', '[', 'Mousse', ']', 'pie', 'trouble', 'Jenna', 'just', 'desserts', 'own', 'life', 'First', 'all', 'up', 'sweetness', 'elderly', 'diner', 'owner', 'Joe', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'who', 'can', 'turn', 'be', 'scathingly', 'ornery', 'genuinely', 'sweet', 'Next', 'line', 'obstetrician', 'Dr.', 'Jim', 'Pomatter', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'whom', 'resentfully', 'replaced', 'familiar', 'female', 'doctor', 'Connecticut', 'ways', 'place', 'deep', 'Southern', 'community', 'Nevertheless', 'tear', 'down', 'jaundiced', 'demeanor', 'provide', 'slice', 'sweet', 'potato', 'pie.The', 'extra', 'ingredients', 'make', ""'The"", 'Waitress', 'special', 'sensual', 'construction', 'fast-lapsed', 'pies', 'Jenna', 'own', 'narration', 'well-crafted', 'music', 'scene', 'symphony', 'Earl', 'foreboding', 'music', 'jaggedly', 'edited', 'scenes', 'Jenna', 'Jim', 'provide', 'classical', 'music', 'one', 'notch', 'lower', 'Tchycovsky', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'complete', 'spinning', 'camera', 'angles', 'fussy', 'little', 'toddler', 'diner', 'horror', 'Wagner', 'Topped', 'off', 'great', 'dialogue', 'including', 'narrated', 'letters', 'unborn', 'baby', 'work', 'unbosoming', 'soliloquy', 'have', 'movie', 'distinct', 'perfection', 'Waitress', 'reminded', 'loose', 'associations', 'other', 'movies', 'including', 'Alice', ""n't"", 'Live', 'Here', 'Any', ""More'Alice"", 'Does', ""n't"", 'Live', 'Here', 'Anymoreand', 'Terms', 'Endearment', ""'Terms"", 'Endearmentbut', 'are', 'only', 'hints', 'distinctive', 'flavor', 'movie', 'Noting', 'nature', 'Adrienne', 'Shelly', 's', 'tragic', 'death', 'misfortune', 'played', 'even', 'worse', 'role', 'own', 'life']",N/A

For the most part I think everyone could find a piece of this pie that is like our lives in general.Jenna is the main character married to a not so nice husband named Earl.  Jenna is a sweet woman who finds out she is pregnant early on.  Most of her challenge comes from trying to find out if she really wants her baby.  It is something I am sure many women have worried about in a loveless marriage.  Jenna has just been given a new doctor after finding out her familiar doctor is retiring.  Her new doctor is a man and the complexities come from that.The story then seems to get more complex after that.  It becomes evident how unhappy Jenna really is and how she expresses her feelings thru her creative pie making.  As she becomes closer to her doctor they start a romantic relationship.  Jenna now must fight between her happiness she has just found and not cheating on her husband.  Of course everything could be perfect but it isn't.This movie is really wonderful and I am sure just about everyone will be able to relate to it in some way.  The happiness, sadness, and even anger.

This film is kind of choppy but thanks to Russell's delicate but fearless performance - she is the saving grace here.

She ends up pregnant and starts an affair with her doctor played by cutie Nathan Fillon, and oh yeah Jenna loves to create unique and delicious pies.

1105492,A10UGG54QNH71L,B000VY1EYG,"Alex S ""Blurb""","[1, 2]","When I read about this film, I thought, ""Here's another small-town American indie, focusing on peculiar characters that turn out to be real, just like us."" How was this going to be different from numerous other similar films, such as ""Dan in Real Life"", or ""Friends With Money"" - all good films, mind you, but lacking in the originality department? I didn't expect much going to see ""Waitress"", but, flaws and all, the film won me over with its sincerity, and more so with the lead performance by the fantastic Keri Russell.Jenna (Keri Russell) seems numbed by life. She works at a diner with a semi-abusive boss (Lew Temple), her gal friends (Cheryl Hines and Adrienne Shelly), and the diner's owner Ol' Joe (the great Andy Griffith), who hates everyone but has a special affection for Jenna. Jenna lives with a half-demented, overly protective husband Earl (Jeremy Sisto) who constantly harasses her, and threatens to beat the living hell out of her if she dares leave. One day she discovers that she's pregnant, which leads to meeting the young doctor Pomatter (Nathan Fillion).The film is a weird combination of dramatic realism and borderline-slapstick, emphasized by some caricature characters (particularly the boss, and a young guy (Eddie Jameson) who proposes to Jenna's friend - he seems like he belongs in a mental institution). Shelly didn't seem to always have a proper grasp of the tone she wanted to sustain. Which is a shame, because a lot of the scenes - especially the ones between Jenna and Dr. Pomatter - are very assured, with snappy dialogue and great chemistry. It makes you wish the filmmakers just ditched the whole attempt at satirizing Southerners (my guess is that's what they were aiming for?) and concentrate on the serious aspects.There are other flaws in the film. We never really understand Earl, where he's coming from, or why Jenna is with him. He's a nasty piece of work, that guy. Her sudden change of attitude near the end of the film is more than forced, making you wonder why she didn't come to those conclusions much earlier. And no one will ever doubt the fate of Ol' Joe. Last but not least, Keri Russell is great and all, but somehow, she never really feels like she belongs in that diner. I guess it's kind of the film's point, but still, there's this hint of sophistication to her, a knowing sort of spark in her eyes that can't be erased.Still, as I said, ""Waitress"" had me, at around the 15-minute mark to be exact, when Jenna meets the doc. Their interaction was music to my ears; there was an honesty to it, a truthfulness absent in most other cardboard wannabe indies. I really wanted those two to get together.Unlike ""Chocolat"", where characters got aroused from eating chocolates, ""Waitress"" keeps its metaphors to a minimum. It's interlaced with quick-cuts of savory pies, the names of which are paralleled to the heroine's life (e.g. ""I Hate My Husband"" pie). The pies she makes provoke euphoric feelings in people, as if by tasting them they are offered a glimpse of heaven. This is to emphasize Jenna's passion, her ability to lead a life much more fulfilling than her hometown can provide. But the pie-making allegory is never rubbed in your face (like the nauseatingly sweet ""Chocolat"").With perhaps a tad too many ingredients, ""Waitress"" nevertheless offers a mouth-watering confection.",4,"A Sweet Slice of ""Another Quirky Little Drama"" Pie...",1201910400,"02 2, 2008",2008,3346,"['When', 'read', 'film', 'thought', 'Here', 'small-town', 'American', 'indie', 'focusing', 'peculiar', 'characters', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'real', 'just', 'How', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'different', 'numerous', 'other', 'similar', 'films', 'such', 'Dan', 'Real', 'Life', 'Friends', 'Money', 'good', 'films', 'mind', 'lacking', 'originality', 'department', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'going', 'see', 'Waitress', 'flaws', 'film', 'won', 'over', 'sincerity', 'more', 'so', 'lead', 'performance', 'fantastic', 'Keri', 'Russell.Jenna', 'Keri', 'Russell', 'numbed', 'life', 'diner', 'semi-abusive', 'boss', 'Lew', 'Temple', 'gal', 'friends', 'Cheryl', 'Hines', 'Adrienne', 'Shelly', 'diner', 'owner', 'Ol', 'Joe', 'great', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'who', 'everyone', 'special', 'affection', 'Jenna', 'Jenna', 'half-demented', 'overly', 'protective', 'husband', 'Earl', 'Jeremy', 'Sisto', 'who', 'constantly', 'beat', 'living', 'hell', 'leave', 'One', 'day', 'pregnant', 'meeting', 'young', 'doctor', 'Pomatter', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', '.The', 'film', 'weird', 'combination', 'dramatic', 'realism', 'borderline-slapstick', 'emphasized', 'caricature', 'characters', 'particularly', 'boss', 'young', 'guy', 'Eddie', 'Jameson', 'who', 'Jenna', 'friend', 'mental', 'institution', 'Shelly', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'always', 'have', 'proper', 'grasp', 'tone', 'wanted', 'sustain', 'Which', 'shame', 'lot', 'scenes', 'especially', 'ones', 'Jenna', 'Dr.', 'Pomatter', 'are', 'very', 'assured', 'snappy', 'dialogue', 'great', 'chemistry', 'wish', 'filmmakers', 'just', 'ditched', 'whole', 'attempt', 'satirizing', 'Southerners', 'guess', 'what', 'were', 'aiming', 'concentrate', 'serious', 'aspects.There', 'are', 'other', 'flaws', 'film', 'never', 'really', 'understand', 'Earl', 'where', 'coming', 'why', 'Jenna', 'nasty', 'piece', 'work', 'guy', 'sudden', 'change', 'attitude', 'end', 'film', 'more', 'forced', 'making', 'wonder', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'conclusions', 'much', 'earlier', 'one', 'will', 'ever', 'doubt', 'fate', 'Ol', 'Joe', 'Last', 'not', 'least', 'Keri', 'Russell', 'great', 'somehow', 'never', 'really', 'feels', 'diner', 'guess', 'kind', 'film', 'point', 'still', 'hint', 'sophistication', 'knowing', 'sort', 'spark', 'eyes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'erased.Still', 'said', 'Waitress', 'had', '15-minute', 'mark', 'be', 'exact', 'when', 'Jenna', 'doc', 'interaction', 'was', 'music', 'ears', 'was', 'honesty', 'truthfulness', 'absent', 'most', 'other', 'cardboard', 'wannabe', 'indies', 'really', 'wanted', 'two', 'get', 'Chocolat', 'where', 'characters', 'got', 'aroused', 'eating', 'chocolates', 'Waitress', 'metaphors', 'minimum', 'interlaced', 'quick-cuts', 'savory', 'pies', 'names', 'are', 'paralleled', 'heroine', 'life', 'e.g', 'Hate', 'Husband', 'pie', 'pies', 'provoke', 'euphoric', 'feelings', 'people', 'tasting', 'are', 'offered', 'glimpse', 'heaven', 'emphasize', 'Jenna', 'passion', 'ability', 'lead', 'life', 'much', 'more', 'fulfilling', 'hometown', 'can', 'provide', 'pie-making', 'allegory', 'never', 'rubbed', 'face', 'nauseatingly', 'sweet', 'Chocolat', '.With', 'perhaps', 'tad', 'too', 'many', 'ingredients', 'Waitress', 'nevertheless', 'mouth-watering', 'confection']",N/A
1105493,AGEIT17HENDIS,B000VY1EYG,Alfred Johnson,"[1, 1]","Readers of this space may have noticed that most of the DVD's that I have reviewed tend to be from the black and white period of cinema history or, if later, have some overwhelming political significance like the movie Reds. For the record I do watch some current films but that I do not review them is for the most part I do not find them worthy of review in this space. However it is probably a surprise that I am reviewing a 2007 film about a spunky pie-making crazed waitress caught up in a world that is not of her own making and seemingly is a black hole as she attempts to get out.The plotline of this film is that a young, fetching, wholesome and whimsical working class waitress in a pie caf&eacute; has become unintentionally (on her part, at least) pregnant by her oafish, crude and violent husband out somewhere in small town America. This predicament is exactly the nightmare scenario that this woman does not want. Initially she wants neither the baby nor her husband. What she does really want is to win a big pie bake-off and flee the small burg. The plot meanders around the struggle to reach that goal. Along the way she is romantically involved with her attending physician, begins to get out from under her husband's thumb (and ultimately the good doctor, who just happens to be married) and by a stroke of good fortune (provided by the old pie caf&eacute; owner, played by Andy Griffith) she is able to be independent and raise her now loved child on her own. Well, this is one variety of the American dream, isn't it?But what about the politics? In a funny way the politics are very mixed. Her apparently adamant aversion to the thought of an abortion despite the boorish husband and the crimp it places on her dreams seems counter-intuitive but within the flow of current politics where the emphasis is on keeping abortion legal but rare. Her sex-crazed affair with her doctor while pregnant puts a very different spin on the assumptions about pregnancy and sexuality as previously portrayed on the screen. But in the end our little working class waitress she gets her little slice of the American dream, right? She gets her ticket to the middle class dream caf&eacute; and her personal freedom. Nobody says that a commercial film has be politically correct left or right (and despite all the clamor, most are thankfully not) or be profound but the definitely mixed messages of this film have got this old leftist scratching his head.

1105494,AIPSUF99BQ17T,B000VY1EYG,Amazon.com-lover,"[8, 10]","I suspected this would be a light and cheery little movie and eagerly looked forward to seeing it... but I did not expect to be so blown away by it! This was no mere little trifle or cream puff ( OK OK) but was a delightful and richly emotional story.Keri Russell, who I have only seen in the celebrity magazines, is not only exceptionally beautiful but a superb actress! She had warmth, depth, grace, and an honesty which made her character not just another archetype of a sweet woman trapped in an unhappy life who eventually breaks free... OK yes it was that classic tale but told in a wholly unique and colorful style. The dialog was refreshing, clever, funny and the characters each had a believability that went beyond stereotype. This was Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore ( one of my absolute favorite movies of all time with the perfect Ellen Burstyn) told a wee bit differently, and just as enjoyably.I truly enjoyed all the actors and actresses, but I have a special warm spot for Cheryl Hines, she is one of the reasons I keep going back to Curb Your Enthusiasm on HBO, and in this,as one of the waitresses, she showed her talent again! She is a sparkling delight.Throughout the movie,I kept saying to myself how sad and what a tragic waste that Adrienne Shelly did not live to see her success, that her life was cut short in such a strange and horrific way.

1105499,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000VY1EYG,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 6]","My wife and I have been excited about seeing this little ditty for some time now so when we finally got to sit down and watch it last night we were filled with high expectations.  I can honestly say that, for the most part, we were not let down.  `Waitress' is a delightfully funny little film that's got layers of meaning and warmth that line the sarcasm and humor beautifully.  There are moments where it seems a little overdone in my opinion, and Keri Russell's performance (while wonder in a complete sense) seems to lack a little in moments.  The script though is what really makes this movie what it is, and the late Adrienne Shelly concocted one of the most entertaining scripts of the year.  It's witty, charming, serious, connected and complete.`Waitress' follows the pregnancy of young Jenna, a local pie maker who hates her life in its entirety.  She's married to a jerk of a man who watches her every move and demands all her time and attention.  Her friends Becky and Dawn don't have half the life she has yet they wouldn't trade shoes with her, not ever.  When Jenna finds out that she is pregnant she is devastated.  It's just one more thing holding her back, keeping her in this town that she loathes with a man she regrets in every way.Jenna decides to keep the baby.  She respects its right to live even though she feels no affection for it and so she starts seeing a doctor.  Her hormones mixed with the overwhelming hinge of regret bring her to fall into an affair with her married doctor and gradually her outlook begins to change.  She has found a small slice of happiness and even though she knows that what she is doing is ultimately wrong she can't stop because it's the only thing she has to hold on to, the only thing that will keep her sane throughout this whole ordeal.This little film is filled with delightful performances by the entire supporting cast.  Nathan Fillion comes off a bit awkward in the beginning but as Jenna's relationship grows with Dr. Pomatter he becomes a more fleshed out and understandable.  Jeremy Sisto is insanely crazy as Jenna's husband Earl and Lew Temple and Eddie Jemison do well to bring life to their small roles as love interests of Jenna's friends.  Keri Russell gives a sweetly endearing performance that is, like I said, wonderful when looking at the complete picture.  My wife in particular loved her blunt delivery of her lines and feelings.  I felt that she was a bit too blunt at times which made it hard to crack her hard exterior and find the real woman on the inside.  There are a few scenes where she nails it, and overall she is wonderful, but there are some areas where I wish she would have worked at it a little better.This movie, in my humble opinion, belongs to two people, Cheryl Hines and Andy Griffith, both of whom steal every scene with their impeccable humor and delivery.  Cheryl Hines is delightfully sarcastic as Becky and Andy Griffith gives one of my favorite supporting performances of the year.  He understands Joe and this works in his, and our, favor.  Adrienne Shelly not only wrote and directed this film but also stars as Dawn, Jenna's gawky friend.  She does a great job of balancing the humor with real emotion.  The tragedy surrounding this film and her untimely death was terrible to hear about, and after seeing this film my wife was actually brought to tears when I told her about Shelly's death.`Waitress' is not a film that will disappoint.  It will make you smile, make you cry and make you fall in love frame by frame.  It's a sweet balance between the comic and the dramatic portions of life that we all come across.

1105501,A3TXO9NUIJ4G0X,B000VY1EYG,Angela,"[0, 1]","Halfway during the film Waitress, when the reluctantly pregnant heroine, Jenna (Keri Russell), experiences an existential reinvigoration thanks to her affair with the sexy new doctor in town, Dr. Pomatter (Nathan Fillion), a song by the band Cake plays.For those who don't know Cake, it's a perfect choice. Not only does this film concern, well, pie-making, but it also exhibits that same sardonic delivery and dry wit, that same blunt deadpan style that Cake is so fond of. This is a film where one character says monotonously, ""Maybe I'm not such a bad guy after all."" And the other character replies, without inflection, ""Maybe you're not such a bad guy after all."" At first, the dialogue sounds awkward, the acting stilted: they're like robot people reciting things. And the semi-mythical Small Southern Town feels false. But gradually you warm to it, and the same sense of low-key, smirking humor seeps into you like... well, like when you listen to Cake.Somewhere in a Small Southern Town, caught sometime in the 1950s, the local pie diner's favorite waitress, Jenna, discovers she's pregnant. This is probably the worst news she could get, as she was planning to flee her abusive, narcissistic husband, Earl (Jeremy Sisto), right after winning big at the upcoming Pie Contest. Jenna is unapologetically grumpy about this news, and even instructs her new Yankee gynecologist, Dr. Pomatter, not to make a big deal about. ""Un-congratulations,"" he supplies.During their regular visits, Jenna becomes increasingly bemused with Pomatter, who is bumbling, perpetually nervous and very adorable. He is also, unfortunately, very married, but this doesn't stop the two of them from unexpectedly assaulting each other in one of the film's best sequences. Carpe diem indeed!Meanwhile, the other waitresses (Adrienne Shelly, who also wrote the screenplay, and Cheryl Hines) are having their own romantic tangles, Andy Griffith (like, the real Andy Griffith) drops by to play the curmudgeonly diner owner, Earl the Evil keeps getting worse and Jenna concocts a series of wonderfully appropriate new recipes. Our favorite being Pregnant Miserable Self Pitying Loser Pie: ""Lumpy oatmeal with fruitcake mashed in. Flamb&eacute;, of course.""This film is a fairy tale that flirts dangerously along the border between an an age beforeBetty Friedanand a sort of uber-ironic post-post-feminism. Thankfully (?) it's pretty light fare, and doesn't aspire to any great revelations about the second sex. Though there is a lot of freshness in that adultery isn't demonized, nor is being less-than-enthusiastic about the fruit of your loins. The cinematography is very geometrical, with angular profiles and neatly aligned pie-making supplies. (This is all lovingly messed up with the arrival of Pomatter and his very doctorly disorganization and adorably confused hair. But I digress.) Things never get as self-consciously ironic or aesthetically stylized as aWes Anderson film, and we, at least, were grateful for that. As Andy Griffith describes the perfect pie in one scene, there's a bittersweet chocolate middle followed by a familiar strawberry sweet ending.*Review originally published at the Post-Punk Cinema Club.",3,"Decent movie pie: one Nathan Fillion, mashed, with two cups of irony...",1272844800,"05 3, 2010",2010,3202,"['Halfway', 'film', 'Waitress', 'when', 'reluctantly', 'pregnant', 'heroine', 'Jenna', 'Keri', 'Russell', 'existential', 'reinvigoration', 'thanks', 'affair', 'sexy', 'new', 'doctor', 'town', 'Dr.', 'Pomatter', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'song', 'band', 'Cake', 'plays.For', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Cake', 'perfect', 'choice', 'Not', 'only', 'film', 'concern', 'well', 'pie-making', 'also', 'same', 'sardonic', 'delivery', 'dry', 'wit', 'same', 'blunt', 'deadpan', 'style', 'Cake', 'so', 'fond', 'film', 'where', 'one', 'character', 'monotonously', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'not', 'such', 'bad', 'guy', 'other', 'character', 'replies', 'inflection', 'Maybe', ""'re"", 'not', 'such', 'bad', 'guy', 'first', 'dialogue', 'awkward', 'acting', 'stilted', ""'re"", 'robot', 'people', 'reciting', 'things', 'semi-mythical', 'Small', 'Southern', 'Town', 'feels', 'false', 'gradually', 'warm', 'same', 'sense', 'low-key', 'smirking', 'humor', 'seeps', 'like', 'well', 'when', 'listen', 'Cake.Somewhere', 'Small', 'Southern', 'Town', 'caught', 'sometime', '1950s', 'local', 'pie', 'diner', 'favorite', 'waitress', 'Jenna', 'pregnant', 'probably', 'worst', 'news', 'could', 'get', 'was', 'planning', 'flee', 'abusive', 'narcissistic', 'husband', 'Earl', 'Jeremy', 'Sisto', 'right', 'winning', 'big', 'upcoming', 'Pie', 'Contest', 'Jenna', 'unapologetically', 'grumpy', 'news', 'even', 'new', 'Yankee', 'gynecologist', 'Dr.', 'Pomatter', 'not', 'make', 'big', 'deal', 'Un-congratulations', 'supplies.During', 'regular', 'visits', 'Jenna', 'increasingly', 'bemused', 'Pomatter', 'who', 'bumbling', 'perpetually', 'nervous', 'very', 'adorable', 'also', 'unfortunately', 'very', 'married', ""n't"", 'stop', 'two', 'unexpectedly', 'assaulting', 'other', 'one', 'film', 'best', 'sequences', 'Carpe', 'diem', 'indeed', 'Meanwhile', 'other', 'waitresses', 'Adrienne', 'Shelly', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'Cheryl', 'Hines', 'are', 'having', 'own', 'romantic', 'tangles', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'real', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'drops', 'play', 'curmudgeonly', 'diner', 'owner', 'Earl', 'Evil', 'getting', 'worse', 'Jenna', 'series', 'wonderfully', 'appropriate', 'new', 'recipes', 'favorite', 'being', 'Pregnant', 'Miserable', 'Self', 'Pitying', 'Loser', 'Pie', 'Lumpy', 'oatmeal', 'fruitcake', 'mashed', 'Flamb', 'eacute', 'course', 'film', 'fairy', 'tale', 'dangerously', 'border', 'age', 'beforeBetty', 'Friedanand', 'sort', 'uber-ironic', 'post-post-feminism', 'Thankfully', 'pretty', 'light', 'fare', ""n't"", 'aspire', 'great', 'revelations', 'second', 'sex', 'lot', 'freshness', 'adultery', ""n't"", 'demonized', 'being', 'less-than-enthusiastic', 'fruit', 'loins', 'cinematography', 'very', 'geometrical', 'angular', 'profiles', 'neatly', 'aligned', 'pie-making', 'supplies', 'lovingly', 'messed', 'up', 'arrival', 'Pomatter', 'very', 'doctorly', 'disorganization', 'adorably', 'confused', 'hair', 'digress', 'Things', 'never', 'get', 'self-consciously', 'ironic', 'aesthetically', 'stylized', 'aWes', 'Anderson', 'film', 'least', 'were', 'grateful', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'perfect', 'pie', 'one', 'scene', 'bittersweet', 'chocolate', 'middle', 'followed', 'familiar', 'strawberry', 'sweet', 'ending', '*Review', 'originally', 'published', 'Post-Punk', 'Cinema', 'Club']",N/A

1105510,AJDQ5EBQNDGLF,B000VY1EYG,Bob L,"[6, 10]","The bittersweet story of a lovely young waitress having the life sucked out of her by a loveless, domineering marriage is beautifully and whimsically realized by the late writer/director/actor Andrienne Shellby. Her direction is perfect. I knew nothing of her going into this movie and upon seeing the end credits was surprised to find she had been the actress playing the part of Dawn, the slightly ditzy waitress. This prompted me to check out the extras, something I rarely do, and there I saw listed A Memorial to Adrienne Shellby. This was a shock. There was nothing in the DVD to tell how she had died and I eventually resorted to Google and Wikipedia to learn about the tragic facts surrounding of her demise.She was able to leave behind this wonderfully smart, warm and beautifully conceived vision. She originally had written the lead role for herself but handed it over to Keri Russell. Russell is fabulous as Jenna the young woman who is reluctant in all phases of her life except one; making pies, which she infuses with a kind of magic that is all her own and to which she gives equally enchanting names. She sees this gift as her way out of her dead end, oppressive life and yearns to enter an upcoming pie baking contest with a grand prize of 25,000 dollars but then she finds out she's pregnant. She meets this news with a detached practicality and seeks out medical advice from her longtime medical confidant, Dr. Mueller. Jenna is disturbed when in place of the cool-headed, older woman physician she's grown so comfortable with she finds a young, attractive and disquieted male substitute, Dr. Pomatter , played by Nathan Fillion with his usual charmingly deft comic style.Waitress is full of rich characters and fine performances. Andy Griffith is particularly perfect in the role of Joe. The scenario can be directly contrasted to others but I think you actually find those set-ups continuely in real life. I've seen all the stuff some others might want to compare this the movie with but I really don't think there's any need to do that. This is a better experience than that and a better movie I doubt I'll see this year.It was disappointing when it was snubbed by the various award committees.

1105511,A1HBC0NBQJHT7X,B000VY1EYG,Bookphile,"[9, 10]","Waitress is a movie that is a lot like real life.  It's funny at times, poignant at others, and very sad and bitter as well.  While some of it is, perhaps, wrapped up a bit too easily, this is a very sincere and heartfelt movie, one that tells a lovely story that centers around women who are dealing with real-life issues.  While I do enjoy some romantic comedies, this movie is leagues above your typical chick flick in that it is a sensitive and realistic portrayal of women dealing with everyday circumstances.  They are average women in complicated circumstances and, at times, it is uncomfortable to watch.The movie centers around Jenna, who is wonderfully played by Keri Russell.  There's just so much about the character that rings true, from her apprehension over having a baby to her loveless marriage.  It's painful to watch her go through the motions and it's obvious that Jenna is really just a shell of herself for most of the movie.  Her husband is a truly loathsome creature who does his best to control every aspect of her life and it is apparent that Jenna has more or less given up.  Though she talks of plans to leave him, it's unclear whether she actually intends to ever carry out this plan.What I most enjoyed about this movie was watching Jenna evolve.  It's obvious from quite early on that she is a people pleaser, even if this means that she allows herself to be walked all over.  She indulges in a bit of fantasy but is then clear sighted enough to understand that it is not reality.  In the end, she comes to realize that it is up to her to take control of her own life.  It is nothing short of a treat to watch a movie that treats its female lead character in this manner.  Jenna's not on a quest for a man, she's on a quest to regain her self-respect and to find her courage.  The ending is particularly satisfying because it is Jenna's own.The movie's strong theme of female friendship was also well done.  Becky, Dawn, and Jenna are all quite different and yet they come together and support one another.  At times they fight and say things that cause one another pain, but, in the end, they are truly there for each other.Perhaps the most touching aspect of this movie, though, was its statement about simple acts of kindness.  I liked how Jenna looked past Joe's cantankerous exterior and found something truly worthwhile within.  The result is rewarding for both characters and it is a moment of truth between these two characters that tugged the most at my heartstrings.  It was this that most impressed me about the movie, that it was truthful in its representation of how some of life's sweetest moments are also some of its saddest.",5,Beautifully written and acted,1203120000,"02 16, 2008",2008,2672,"['Waitress', 'movie', 'lot', 'real', 'life', 'funny', 'times', 'poignant', 'others', 'very', 'sad', 'bitter', 'as', 'well', 'perhaps', 'wrapped', 'up', 'bit', 'too', 'easily', 'very', 'sincere', 'heartfelt', 'movie', 'one', 'lovely', 'story', 'centers', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'dealing', 'real-life', 'issues', 'do', 'enjoy', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'movie', 'leagues', 'typical', 'chick', 'flick', 'sensitive', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'women', 'dealing', 'everyday', 'circumstances', 'are', 'average', 'women', 'complicated', 'circumstances', 'times', 'uncomfortable', 'watch.The', 'movie', 'centers', 'Jenna', 'who', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'Keri', 'Russell', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'character', 'true', 'apprehension', 'having', 'baby', 'loveless', 'marriage', 'painful', 'watch', 'go', 'motions', 'obvious', 'Jenna', 'really', 'just', 'shell', 'herself', 'most', 'movie', 'husband', 'truly', 'loathsome', 'creature', 'who', 'best', 'control', 'aspect', 'life', 'apparent', 'Jenna', 'more', 'less', 'given', 'up', 'talks', 'plans', 'leave', 'unclear', 'actually', 'ever', 'carry', 'out', 'plan.What', 'most', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'was', 'watching', 'Jenna', 'evolve', 'obvious', 'quite', 'early', 'people', 'pleaser', 'even', 'be', 'walked', 'bit', 'fantasy', 'then', 'clear', 'sighted', 'enough', 'understand', 'not', 'reality', 'end', 'realize', 'up', 'take', 'control', 'own', 'life', 'nothing', 'short', 'treat', 'watch', 'movie', 'female', 'lead', 'character', 'manner', 'Jenna', 'not', 'quest', 'man', 'quest', 'regain', 'self-respect', 'find', 'courage', 'ending', 'particularly', 'satisfying', 'Jenna', 'own.The', 'movie', 'strong', 'theme', 'female', 'friendship', 'was', 'also', 'well', 'done', 'Becky', 'Dawn', 'Jenna', 'are', 'quite', 'different', 'yet', 'come', 'together', 'support', 'one', 'times', 'fight', 'say', 'things', 'cause', 'one', 'pain', 'end', 'are', 'truly', 'there', 'other.Perhaps', 'most', 'touching', 'aspect', 'movie', 'though', 'was', 'statement', 'simple', 'acts', 'kindness', 'liked', 'how', 'Jenna', 'looked', 'past', 'Joe', 'cantankerous', 'exterior', 'found', 'something', 'truly', 'worthwhile', 'result', 'rewarding', 'characters', 'moment', 'truth', 'two', 'characters', 'tugged', 'most', 'heartstrings', 'was', 'most', 'impressed', 'movie', 'was', 'truthful', 'representation', 'how', 'life', 'sweetest', 'moments', 'are', 'also', 'saddest']",N/A

She concocts a new recipe everyday, one that generally reflects her current mood and circumstances as they exist at that moment. Trapped in a bad marriage to a controlling, insecure male (Jeremy Sisto) Jena (Keri Russell) tries to hold her life together relying on her culinary creations and friends at the diner to add some semblance of meaning to her existence.Just when her plan of running away and starting fresh somewhere else seems plausible she becomes pregnant and must re-evaluate what to do. A trip to the obstetrician to confirm her pregnancy adds more confusion and emotional angst to the situation when she discovers her old doctor has retired and has been replaced by the handsome Doctor Pomatter (Nathan Fillion).

1105515,A3I7OX03X6KDMN,B000VY1EYG,"Chris Roberts ""Chris Roberts""","[2, 22]","For all the good TV has brought to our society (immeasurable in my estimation) there is something of a curse it places on those who choose to appear on it. And while I watched ""Waitress"" I could not get out of my head the idea that I was just watching some elongated version of Keri Russell's teledrama, you know like, ""Felecity hits skid row and gets knocked up."" The characters (Jenna here, Felecity there) are just so incredibly similar. Both are sweetly natured young girls who try to do right by the world but are overcome by their naivete. Of course as an added bonus here her hair has grown all the way back, so Praise Jesus I guess. Also affected is poor Jeremy Sisto, forever typecast as a crazy thanks to his role on ""Six Feet Under."" He has become so good and so consistent at playing crazy that he is now the go to guy for that type of work. And despite his character here, Earl, being totally overwritten (to the point that his whole existence is made to look like a man hating screed by writer director Adrienne Shelly) he still turns in a great performance that is at once annoying, scary and comedic.The story basics are as simple as they come, Earl plants a little Earl deep inside Jenna and she has to deal with the consequences. To cope she turns to her friends that she works with and distracts herself by conspiring to enter a pie making contest behind Earl's back. Earl meanwhile does his best to be the model husband. He always arrives to pick Jenna up by repeatedly honking the horn. He stomps around demanding money, kisses, and dinner. All in all he would make a perfect Hollywood version of a 1950's American husband. Along the way Jenna starts up an affair with her doctor and for her trouble is called a hussy and ridiculed by the backwards town that she lives in. Never mind that she is trapped in a marriage to an abusive (physically and mentally) husband and that this new guy actually bothers to shave. No, to the residence of Nowhere, USA there is nothing better to do than pass judgment and actively engage in not having a sex life. The story is hokey and silly, but also always genuine and that is its strongest asset. After I tired of its choppy dialogue, sad attempts at wit, and ""spontaneous poetry"" jokes I could still enjoy the company of these characters, and that was almost enough to get it over the top for me.But then there were the values of this film which were as red as the town it took place in. Abortion is the easy answer to most of Jenna's problems but that isn't even on the table here. This kid is just stuck being born into an unloving, abusive, financially crippled home. The whole town is able to feign its way through a ""Scarlet Letter"" act. And why isn't there one character not the color of chalk? I know the South likes their segregation but this is kind of extreme.

DeRiemer,"[4, 5]","Can a poor, pregnant Deep South waitress find happiness baking pies while married to a redneck bully and having an affair with her married gynecologist? No. But don't count on an unhappy ending once she leaves her husband, sends her lover back to his wife and then, thanks to a fortuitous death, manages to bake pies to her heart's content, and sell them, too.Waitress is an eccentric and affectionate look at the life and times of Jenna, played with great empathy and charm by Keri Russell. Jenna is a small-town young woman who married her boyfriend, Earl, and now realizes what a jerk he is. She wants out, with a new life and another chance at happiness. What she doesn't want is Earl or, at first, the baby. Getting it on with the new, young doctor perhaps isn't the best idea, but it gives Jenna some joy. About the only people who really appreciate her are her two friends who also wait on tables at the diner, and the old curmudgeon, played by Andy Griffin, who owns the place and wants what he wants when he wants it...namely, a slice of Jenna's special pie, served by Jenna. Jenna's pies really are deliciously unique. Her mamma taught her long ago, and now Jenna works out all her frustrations and love by inventing all sorts of pies. Despite her pies, her life looks increasingly bleak until...well, see the movie or buy the DVD. It's no spoiler to say that this slightly contrived, oddball romantic comedy has a happy ending, and that pies are the reason.The nice things about the movie are Russell's performance, closely followed by Griffin's. The writer/director, Adrienne Shelly, who also plays one of Jenna's waitress pals, gives the movie a kind of goofy cheer. The movie isn't a cartoon, but there is enough cheerful exaggeration that most of the time Waitress comes across as kind of charming.A bit off-putting, however, is the role of Earl. The guy is so down-right mean and selfish that every time he shows up on screen you'll most likely flinch. Jenna's doctor, on the other hand, comes across just as needy as Earl but also weak. If one of Shelly's messages is that a woman who needs to be strong shouldn't get entangled with most men, she gives us some first-class examples. Jenna is going to be a happy woman, we know, because of a generous bequest, her pies and her baby. I'm not sure an adult male now will ever figure in the mix.Waitress is the kind of feel-good movie that many people will fall in love with. I'm not sure how many times someone will want to watch it, but the first time, if you're not in a curmudgeonly mood, should be satisfying.And for those who occasionally think life is a series of random acts of pointlessness, Adrienne Shelly was murdered just as she was finishing the editing of Waitress. She had been in her office and had complained about the noise a worker on the floor above her was making.

So i bought and watched it the other night.  It's a different twist in that a woman who has a gift for making different pies depending on what kind of situation she's in.  Whether its one on her hating her low-life, self absorbed husband or one because she's pregnant by him and doesnt want the baby.It is really cool how that is integrated into the story and all the actors/actresses in this film make it something that really needs to be seen by any one that is even slightly interested.  Written, directed and starring the late Adrienne Shelley.  She brings something to this movie that you rarely see, its a human aspect and real feelings on a mother that isnt as happy as most that's she's pregnant.Mostly due to her current situation and seriously idiotic husband that she's trying to leave.  She finds relief in a new doctor (Nathan Fillion) that moves into town (married) and they hit it off on so many levels.  He provides relief and so much more to her that her husband doesnt.All in all a film that is worthy of being put into any person's collection.

1105526,A6AGN1U1BDB0V,B000VY1EYG,"Diego F. Mera ""Diego""","[2, 4]","I have mixed thoughts on this movie.  On the one hand I realize that there are actually real people out there just like these characters (contrary to what some others say about the characters being unbelieveable).  There are women either too afraid or passive to take responsibility for the condition they are in.  There are also men so insensitive, abusive, and equally afraid of being abandoned.  Spoiler warning** It seemed that it took the birth of a child for Keri's character to find her backbone and stand up for herself.  It is sad that she wasted so much of her life before she realized that.  In addition, many people get treated the way they allow others to treat them.  Had she found her backbone early, then it may have even been possible for her to save the marriage and for her child to have a responsible and loving father in her life.  I say ""may"" because I know it would have been an uphill battle with him.  She stated herself that he wasn't always that way.It is rather interesting that (with one single exception) every person in this story is depicted as an adulterer or has a very loose sense of sexual moral standard.  Is there a standard?  Of course, even Keri's character states the damage that could be caused should they be found out.  She didn't break it off because she thought what was going on was a good thing.  Yet it comes too little too late.  Sort of like saying, ""hey don't take drugs"", take them anyway, and then at the last couple minutes of the movie say, ""I should not have taken them"".Every man in this movie was incredibly flawed and weak.  The women were just victims of circumstance (until the end of course).  Even though some have characterized Earl as evil - I don't see much difference between Earl and the doctor.  That's right, I said it.  The doctor breached a serious professional, moral, and ethical code with his indiscretions.

Are you kidding me?!?!  First off, this was a first-rate cast.  Keri Russell was amazing.  The supporting cast was very, very good and I loved seeing a spry Andy Griffith, that man is still the man!  Andy and Keri had a great chemistry in this film of mentor/mentee.  Nathan Fillion was excellent as the doctor.  However, as far as the writing goes, the ending leaves way too much to be desired.  Anyone who has seen this movie, including all the five star reviewers here, cannot tell me that by the end of the movie that Jenna and Dr. Pomatter were not truly madly in love.  Think about some of the scenes in the movie: 1) Jenna writing her first letter to baby saying that she hopes at least once it's life it will be held for 20 minutes straight by someone with no selfish intentions whatsoever, 2) when Dr. Pomatter says that he can find the true meaning of life by looking in Jenna's sad eyes, 3) the fact that they were both willing to drop everything and run away and were minutes from doing so before Jenna's water broke.  Arggghhhhh, that ending frustrated me!  So the end has the doctor's wife come in and be very nice, so that means Jenna and the doctor don't end up together?!?!?!?!?  The only possible conclusion I can come to is that a feminist wrote this ending and said eff all guys, this woman will end up alone and take care of herself.  Either that, or someone tried to get too clever with ""well, everyone expects them to end up together, so I just won't have that happen and it will be 'cool and different'""  WTF?!?! NO, it's NOT cool and different.  LOL, guess I'm still just a little upset because I literally just finished watching and felt compelled to come write this review.  I guess I should give the movie credit in that it moved me, one way or another.  I will probably watch this again, except I'll probably be turning it off right when she dumps loser husband and then create my own ending in my mind where her and the doctor still end up together.  In the end, this movie is well worth watching and forming your own opinion, the actors were fantastic and despite the ending, this is one unique story that is still full of hope.

Fortunately, actress Adrienne Shelly shows a supple dexterity in balancing all the off-kilter elements since she wrote and directed the film. Sadly, this would also be her last film as she was murdered shortly before its debut at this year's Sundance Festival. I was previously not familiar with Shelly's work either before or behind the camera, but the uniquely fresh perspective on display here makes her loss as a filmmaking creative force feel all the more tragic.The plot concerns the travails of Jenna, a waitress at Joe's Pie Diner. Stuck in a loveless marriage to an abusive, childish man named Earl, she finds herself unhappily pregnant with his child and dreams of escaping her dreary life. Since her accumulated tip money is not nearly enough for her to leave, Jenna wants to enter a local pie-making contest with a grand prize of $25,000. At the diner, she shows a unique talent for creating unusual pies, and inspired by the events in her life, she makes and names a new one every day. Her best friends are the two other waitresses at the diner - sassy, breast-imbalanced Becky and vacuous, pasty-skinned Dawn, which makes the set-up feel like Martin Scorsese'sAlice Doesn't Live Here Anymore(or more accurately thesitcomit spawned). There is even a character named old Joe, the bromide-spouting owner of the diner dispensing nuggets of unsolicited advice to Jenna. Further complicating matters is the town's new gynecologist, the befuddled and sensitive Dr. Pomatter, and what happens after he and Jenna meet becomes inevitable.The story doesn't take many surprising turns, especially when it is clear from the outset that we are following Jenna's bumptious journey toward self-fulfillment. However, what Shelly does extremely well is add her own sense of local color and realistic character development to the potentially clich&eacute;-ridden situation. The result is often funny, sometimes poignant and at certain points, intentionally absurd. With her porcelain doll looks and previously passive demeanor, Keri Russell would seem like a shallow choice to play Jenna, but she surprises by giving a fully dimensional and affecting performance. Her best scenes are early on as her quietly desperate situation is being established. The other actors provide solid support. Nathan Fillion provides a nicely disheveled charm to the smitten Pomatter, although his character is developed more as a fantasy figure. More interesting is Jeremy Sisto as Earl, who is at turns, dangerous and pathetically needy. Sisto plays him with such simmering menace that it's hard to believe the actor played Jesus in a1999 miniseries(featuring Debra Messing as Mary Magdalene!).Playing the saucy ""Flo""-type waitress, Cheryl Hines provides expert comic support as Becky, while Shelly herself plays Dawn with quirky, bespectacled vulnerability. As old Joe, Andy Griffith shows up periodically to comment on what's going on. The film's atmospheric elements are first-rate starting with Matthew Irving's cinematography (the brightly colored finale has a fairytale feeling thanks to his expert camerawork) and a clever soundtrack sweetened by a lullaby written by Andrew Hollander and Shelly. The 2007 DVD comes with a standard set of extras including an informative commentary track by Russell and producer Michael Roiff. The ten-minute making-of featurette, ""This is How We Made Waitress Pie"", is mainly a series of on-set clips and interviews that look directed toward a press junket. There is a brief memorial tribute of sorts to Shelly, though the treatment feels cursory and elusive given the graphic circumstances of her death. Rounding out the extras are a profile on Russell's approach to the role of Jenna and a more superficial featurette about everyone's favorite pies.",4,"The ""I-Think-I've-Seen-This-Before-But-I-Still-Liked-It-a-Lot"" Pie",1198108800,"12 20, 2007",2007,4003,"['agreeably', 'idiosyncratic', '2007', 'dramedy', 'plenty', 'offer', 'great', 'moments', 'warmth', 'humor', 'eccentricities', 'sometimes', 'threaten', 'overwhelm', 'quiet', 'slightly', 'fantastical', 'story', 'heart', 'film', 'Fortunately', 'actress', 'Adrienne', 'Shelly', 'supple', 'dexterity', 'balancing', 'off-kilter', 'elements', 'wrote', 'directed', 'film', 'Sadly', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'last', 'film', 'was', 'murdered', 'shortly', 'debut', 'year', 'Sundance', 'Festival', 'was', 'previously', 'not', 'familiar', 'Shelly', 'work', 'camera', 'uniquely', 'fresh', 'perspective', 'display', 'here', 'loss', 'filmmaking', 'creative', 'force', 'feel', 'more', 'tragic.The', 'plot', 'concerns', 'travails', 'Jenna', 'waitress', 'Joe', 'Pie', 'Diner', 'Stuck', 'loveless', 'marriage', 'abusive', 'childish', 'man', 'named', 'Earl', 'unhappily', 'pregnant', 'child', 'dreams', 'escaping', 'dreary', 'life', 'accumulated', 'tip', 'money', 'not', 'nearly', 'enough', 'leave', 'Jenna', 'enter', 'local', 'pie-making', 'contest', 'grand', 'prize', '25,000', 'diner', 'unique', 'talent', 'creating', 'unusual', 'pies', 'inspired', 'events', 'life', 'new', 'one', 'day', 'best', 'friends', 'are', 'two', 'other', 'waitresses', 'diner', 'sassy', 'breast-imbalanced', 'Becky', 'vacuous', 'pasty-skinned', 'Dawn', 'set-up', 'feel', 'Martin', ""Scorsese'sAlice"", 'Does', ""n't"", 'Live', 'Here', 'Anymore', 'more', 'accurately', 'thesitcomit', 'spawned', 'even', 'character', 'named', 'old', 'Joe', 'bromide-spouting', 'owner', 'diner', 'dispensing', 'nuggets', 'unsolicited', 'advice', 'Jenna', 'Further', 'complicating', 'matters', 'town', 'new', 'gynecologist', 'befuddled', 'sensitive', 'Dr.', 'Pomatter', 'what', 'Jenna', 'meet', 'inevitable.The', 'story', ""n't"", 'take', 'many', 'surprising', 'turns', 'especially', 'when', 'clear', 'outset', 'are', 'following', 'Jenna', 'bumptious', 'journey', 'self-fulfillment', 'However', 'what', 'Shelly', 'extremely', 'well', 'add', 'own', 'sense', 'local', 'color', 'realistic', 'character', 'development', 'potentially', 'clich', 'eacute', '-ridden', 'situation', 'result', 'often', 'funny', 'sometimes', 'poignant', 'certain', 'points', 'intentionally', 'absurd', 'porcelain', 'doll', 'previously', 'passive', 'demeanor', 'Keri', 'Russell', 'would', 'seem', 'shallow', 'choice', 'play', 'Jenna', 'giving', 'fully', 'dimensional', 'affecting', 'performance', 'best', 'scenes', 'are', 'early', 'quietly', 'desperate', 'situation', 'being', 'established', 'other', 'actors', 'provide', 'solid', 'support', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'nicely', 'disheveled', 'charm', 'smitten', 'Pomatter', 'character', 'developed', 'more', 'fantasy', 'figure', 'More', 'interesting', 'Jeremy', 'Sisto', 'Earl', 'who', 'turns', 'dangerous', 'pathetically', 'needy', 'Sisto', 'such', 'simmering', 'menace', 'hard', 'believe', 'actor', 'played', 'Jesus', 'a1999', 'miniseries', 'featuring', 'Debra', 'Messing', 'Mary', 'Magdalene', '.Playing', 'saucy', 'Flo', '-type', 'waitress', 'Cheryl', 'Hines', 'expert', 'comic', 'support', 'Becky', 'Shelly', 'Dawn', 'quirky', 'bespectacled', 'vulnerability', 'old', 'Joe', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'up', 'periodically', 'comment', 'what', 'going', 'film', 'atmospheric', 'elements', 'are', 'first-rate', 'starting', 'Matthew', 'Irving', 'cinematography', 'brightly', 'colored', 'finale', 'fairytale', 'feeling', 'thanks', 'expert', 'camerawork', 'clever', 'soundtrack', 'sweetened', 'lullaby', 'written', 'Andrew', 'Hollander', 'Shelly', '2007', 'DVD', 'standard', 'set', 'extras', 'including', 'informative', 'commentary', 'track', 'Russell', 'producer', 'Michael', 'Roiff', 'ten-minute', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'How', 'Made', 'Waitress', 'Pie', 'mainly', 'series', 'on-set', 'clips', 'interviews', 'look', 'directed', 'press', 'junket', 'brief', 'memorial', 'tribute', 'sorts', 'Shelly', 'treatment', 'cursory', 'elusive', 'given', 'graphic', 'circumstances', 'death', 'Rounding', 'out', 'extras', 'are', 'profile', 'Russell', 'approach', 'role', 'Jenna', 'more', 'superficial', 'featurette', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'pies']",N/A

1105535,A73DFWJE0CGY6,B000VY1EYG,"Flight Risk (The Gypsy Moth) ""Exiled Yankee""","[3, 6]","This is a movie that perhaps owes some of its dynamics to movies like ""Steel Magnolias"", with the major strengths being the friendships and dependencies that bind together a small band of women, and the main story revolving around one of them - in this case, Keri Russell, playing Jenna, a waitress at a pie diner somewhere obviously in the South, who has seemingly insurmountable personal problems. Her husband is a boor, self-centered, controlling, jealous and demanding; she hasn't loved him in years, but in an evening of drinking with him has had the misfortune of getting pregnant. She feels trapped; she doesn't want the baby, but never considers anything drastic - she decides instead to have it, deal with it somehow, and leave her husband with money she has been squirreling away out of her husband's knowledge.Keri Russell is one of those actresses that people seem to know, even if they haven't seen her in anything. I myself had never seen her in any kind of production before this, but was familiar with her; her beautiful face is hard to forget. In this role she is word-perfect, and perfect in every other way; you feel her sense of hopelessness in her situation, and her relief, however brief, in the escapes she makes while conjuring up the pies that have made her a name in her little town, and that make people flock to the pie diner for her creations, which she names for the events in her life that drive her. She names a pie for the baby she doesn't want; she names a pie for an affair she has with her doctor (Bad Baby Pie and Naughty Pumpkin Pie, respectively), and as the beau of one of the other waitresses makes up poetry on the spot, Jenna creates spontaneous pie recipes; in the waiting room at the doctor's, sitting waiting for the bus, lying in bed next to her sorry excuse for a husband. Pie is her release and her wonderland; even her face transforms as she puts one together.Jenna, for all her problems, is the rock this story is built on. The other two waitresses, Becky and Dawn (Cheryl Hines and Adrienne Shelly - Shelly wrote and directed the movie, by the way)are rather fluffy sidebars to the story, both involved in their own man problems, but neither of them in crisis mode. This was billed as a comedy, and there are funny bits, but it is largely about how Jenna manages her own horrible life. The bad husband is just brutish enough so that you wonder for a while if anything really bad will happen here, and the moral issue about the affair Jenna has with the doctor - he is also married - will offend some, but you understand what drives the move, at least from Jenna's end. She needs this connection, since she has long lost anything like it at home, and finding that someone thinks she is wonderful, after constantly being belittled by her insecure husband is irresistible to her.The catalyst for change, strangely enough, is the local grumpy old man entrepreneur, who owns a good part of the town businesses (Andy Griffith). I know it's sacrilege, but I've never been a Griffith fan; but here I thoroughly enjoyed his performance, probably because he so much resembled a relative at the same stage. As Old Joe, the owner of the diner, he runs riot over everybody with his exacting demands about his food, and the one person who can handle him is - you guessed it - Jenna. He treats her with a curious mix of curmudgeonly fatherly concern and as someone half in love with her himself. He sees in her the yearning to break free that he wanted at the same age and never accomplished, and he urges her to 'start fresh'.Toward the end of the movie the story drags a bit, and questions occurred to me - why didn't anybody know about the affair, as they weren't very discreet? Did I mention this was a small town? I grew up in a small town, and even the kids in town knew about all the affairs going on. Why was Earl, Jenna's husband, so willing to believe the money that he eventually found was destined for the baby? Was he really that stupid? So there were parts that didn't jive, but the story was absorbing and touching; realistic in presentation; not too maudlin, though predictable (there are no surprises), and though it took her a long time to get to it, Jenna resolves everything satisfactorily - except for the two men in her life, as far as they're concerned.The story that seems to be getting the most play, however, happened outside of the movie; the writer/director/actress of the movie, Adrienne Shelly, died before ""Waitress"" was shown, the victim of murder in her apartment/office in New York. I am sorry to say I had never heard of Ms Shelly before this movie, and was unaware of her death throughout my viewing of it, so I had the gift of seeing it without any preconcieved assumptions or predispositions, for which I am grateful. I saw the movie the way Ms Shelly wanted me to see it - not mourning her or feeling bad for her, but simply enjoying this last exuberant project she brought to us.",4,A slice of life,1196380800,"11 30, 2007",2007,4956,"['movie', 'perhaps', 'dynamics', 'movies', 'Steel', 'Magnolias', 'major', 'strengths', 'being', 'friendships', 'dependencies', 'bind', 'together', 'small', 'band', 'women', 'main', 'story', 'revolving', 'one', 'case', 'Keri', 'Russell', 'playing', 'Jenna', 'waitress', 'pie', 'diner', 'somewhere', 'obviously', 'South', 'who', 'seemingly', 'insurmountable', 'personal', 'problems', 'husband', 'boor', 'self-centered', 'controlling', 'jealous', 'demanding', ""n't"", 'loved', 'years', 'evening', 'drinking', 'had', 'misfortune', 'getting', 'pregnant', 'trapped', ""n't"", 'want', 'baby', 'never', 'considers', 'anything', 'drastic', 'instead', 'have', 'deal', 'somehow', 'leave', 'husband', 'money', 'been', 'squirreling', 'away', 'husband', 'knowledge.Keri', 'Russell', 'one', 'actresses', 'people', 'seem', 'know', 'even', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'anything', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'kind', 'production', 'was', 'familiar', 'beautiful', 'face', 'hard', 'forget', 'role', 'word-perfect', 'perfect', 'other', 'way', 'feel', 'sense', 'hopelessness', 'situation', 'relief', 'however', 'brief', 'escapes', 'conjuring', 'up', 'pies', 'have', 'made', 'name', 'little', 'town', 'make', 'people', 'flock', 'pie', 'diner', 'creations', 'events', 'life', 'pie', 'baby', ""n't"", 'want', 'pie', 'affair', 'doctor', 'Bad', 'Baby', 'Pie', 'Naughty', 'Pumpkin', 'Pie', 'respectively', 'beau', 'one', 'other', 'waitresses', 'up', 'poetry', 'spot', 'Jenna', 'spontaneous', 'pie', 'recipes', 'waiting', 'room', 'doctor', 'sitting', 'waiting', 'bus', 'lying', 'bed', 'next', 'sorry', 'excuse', 'husband', 'Pie', 'release', 'wonderland', 'even', 'face', 'transforms', 'one', 'together.Jenna', 'problems', 'rock', 'story', 'built', 'other', 'two', 'waitresses', 'Becky', 'Dawn', 'Cheryl', 'Hines', 'Adrienne', 'Shelly', 'Shelly', 'wrote', 'directed', 'movie', 'way', 'are', 'rather', 'fluffy', 'sidebars', 'story', 'involved', 'own', 'man', 'problems', 'crisis', 'mode', 'was', 'billed', 'comedy', 'are', 'funny', 'bits', 'largely', 'how', 'Jenna', 'own', 'horrible', 'life', 'bad', 'husband', 'just', 'brutish', 'enough', 'wonder', 'while', 'anything', 'really', 'bad', 'will', 'happen', 'here', 'moral', 'issue', 'affair', 'Jenna', 'doctor', 'also', 'married', 'will', 'offend', 'understand', 'move', 'least', 'Jenna', 'end', 'connection', 'long', 'lost', 'anything', 'home', 'finding', 'someone', 'wonderful', 'constantly', 'being', 'belittled', 'insecure', 'husband', 'irresistible', 'her.The', 'catalyst', 'change', 'strangely', 'enough', 'local', 'grumpy', 'old', 'man', 'entrepreneur', 'who', 'good', 'part', 'town', 'businesses', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'know', 'sacrilege', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'Griffith', 'fan', 'here', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'performance', 'probably', 'so', 'much', 'resembled', 'relative', 'same', 'stage', 'Old', 'Joe', 'owner', 'diner', 'riot', 'everybody', 'exacting', 'demands', 'food', 'one', 'person', 'who', 'can', 'handle', 'guessed', 'Jenna', 'curious', 'mix', 'curmudgeonly', 'fatherly', 'concern', 'someone', 'half', 'love', 'yearning', 'break', 'free', 'wanted', 'same', 'age', 'never', 'accomplished', ""'start"", ""fresh'.Toward"", 'end', 'movie', 'story', 'bit', 'questions', 'occurred', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'anybody', 'know', 'affair', 'were', ""n't"", 'very', 'discreet', 'Did', 'mention', 'was', 'small', 'town', 'grew', 'up', 'small', 'town', 'even', 'kids', 'town', 'knew', 'affairs', 'going', 'Why', 'was', 'Earl', 'Jenna', 'husband', 'so', 'willing', 'believe', 'money', 'eventually', 'found', 'was', 'destined', 'baby', 'Was', 'really', 'stupid', 'So', 'were', 'parts', 'did', ""n't"", 'jive', 'story', 'was', 'absorbing', 'touching', 'realistic', 'presentation', 'not', 'too', 'maudlin', 'predictable', 'are', 'surprises', 'took', 'long', 'time', 'get', 'Jenna', 'everything', 'satisfactorily', 'two', 'men', 'life', 'as', 'far', ""'re"", 'concerned.The', 'story', 'be', 'getting', 'most', 'play', 'however', 'happened', 'movie', 'writer/director/actress', 'movie', 'Adrienne', 'Shelly', 'died', 'Waitress', 'was', 'shown', 'victim', 'murder', 'apartment/office', 'New', 'York', 'am', 'sorry', 'say', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'Ms', 'Shelly', 'movie', 'was', 'unaware', 'death', 'viewing', 'so', 'had', 'gift', 'seeing', 'preconcieved', 'assumptions', 'predispositions', 'am', 'grateful', 'saw', 'movie', 'way', 'Ms', 'Shelly', 'wanted', 'see', 'not', 'mourning', 'feeling', 'bad', 'simply', 'enjoying', 'last', 'exuberant', 'project', 'brought']",N/A

1105538,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000VY1EYG,Grady Harp,"[8, 9]","On the surface WAITRESS is a simple, honest, unpretentious, funny, tender, and sensitive film about simple people in a small Southern town: it is the core of the film, the examination of individual's choices, consequences, rights, and fraternity that makes the little Indie so special.  And another feature that adds a dimension of significance to the movie is that actress/writer/director Adrienne Shelly did not live to see the magic she created: Shelly was murdered in November 2006, a loss of a superb budding talent.Using a very small cast of characters WAITRESS takes place in a Pie Diner, owned by the crusty and demanding Old Joe (Andy Griffith), managed by the grumpy Cal (Lew Temple), and run by three waitresses - frumpy little Dawn (Adrienne Shelly) looking for love, been-there-done-that Becky (Cheryl Hines) whose married to a drooling waste, and Jenna (Keri Russell), an unhappily married (to Earl - Jeremy Sisto) pie maker expert who longs to leave her marriage but has just discovered she is pregnant.  She comes under the care of the OB-GYN Dr. Pomatter (Nathan Fillion - also married) and in the course of her care the two fall in love.  How Jenna manages to cope with the disruptive pregnancy and the other waitresses deal with their simple lives is the crux of the story.  And while this simple plot lone doesn't appear to offer much, the manner in which it is written and acted makes is a little jewel.Many are touting the emergence of Keri Russell as a serious actress as the reason for seeing this film, but the real genius behind the honest simplicity of the story is the sadly deceased Adrienne Shelly.  She will be missed.  In a series of fitting homages the featurettes add to the DVD version of this film.

1105546,AL5OEDM8TPTKV,B000VY1EYG,James Hiller,"[7, 9]","Much has been made of the tragic and untimely death of actress and filmmaker Adrienne Shelley. Unfortunately, the publicity of her demise made me want to avoid this movie when it hit the theaters, fearing the sorrow of her circumstance would cloud this movie for me. Sounds illogical now, but then, it made sense. However, months after leaving the theater, and me popping this DVD into my player, time has shown her last movie ""Waitress"" to be an unusual movie in so many ways.Keri Russell, hair and all, stars in this movie about being trapped in life circumstances, and how getting out of that trap isn't so easy. Keri plays the titular Jenna, a woman trapped in a dead end marriage only to find out she's pregnant after a night of alcoholic drudgery with her own husband. Her only talent, and a very marketable one at that, is making pies, which helps her narrate this charming feature. It's Jenna's sometimes off decision making ability that drive this picture. Will she escape her horrid husband to a better life? Will she give up the baby once she has it? Will she go out of her mind?Russell's Jenna is extremely funny and tragic. You can tell how easy it is for a beautiful girl to make a wrong decision or two, and end up as a waitress in a pie diner in the south. It's happened to her two friends, Becky and Dawn, each who wrestle with their own unusual demons in the story. Shelley's script is wise to never allowing this film to become anything sentimental, which may have allowed the film to sap into a Hallmark special all too easily. Jenna's hatred of her pregnancy is funny and understandable.Rarely do films surprise me, genuinely, but I was surprised at the end of the movie, which I shall not divulge here. Shelley saved us a couple of things for the ending that both make sense and bring a sense of joy to the movie that is unsurpassed. When Jenna walks away from the diner (no spoilers here!), you are walking with her, reveling that she has finally made some good decisions after all.It's too bad that Shelley didn't live to see the acclaim this movie earned. It's too bad that this creative filmmaker's voice was silenced by a heinous act.

1105550,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B000VY1EYG,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[9, 9]","This movie almost remind me of the TV sitcom Alice: set in a small, out-of-the-way diner run by a cranky head cook with a heart of gold, and staffed by a trio of waitresses, the brash Blondie Southern one, the child-like and naive one, and the level-headed single mom (or mom-to-be, in this case), along with the typical assortment of wacky and colorful customers. Writer/director Adrienne Shelly manages to take this template and make something wonderful from it, however.  Far from being a mere remake of Alice, Waitress is a well-conceived and well-executed exploration of one woman's fight to come into her own and realize her dreams, despite the bad choices and wrong decisions she's made along the way that weigh her down.What truly sets this movie apart from most other big-screen fare is the script. The dialogue, written by Adrienne Shelly - who also directed and co-stars as Dawn, the mousy waitress who eventually finds true love - sparkles with wit, charm and humor. It's fast and it's funny, but it always feels totally natural, due in no small part, of course, to the talents of the actors and actresses charged with delivering it. Unlike the writing in, say, Gilmore Girls, widely praised for it's unique character, the dialogue in Waitress never seems forced or unnatural. It's brilliant without being obtrusive.My only downsize to this film is the fact that the ""men are dogs"" message is a little heavy-handed. Without exception, all the male characters in Waitress are presented as either mean, like Earl (Jeremy Sisto), unprincipled, like Dr. Pomatter (Nathan Fillion), or just plain weird, like Ogie(Eddie Jemison's). Even Joe (Andy Griffith), who turns out to be truly kind and caring, is shown throughout most of the film to be abrasive and demanding, to the point that long-suffering Jenna is the only person who can deal with him and is truly his only friend. This is obviously a film made by a woman, primarily for a female audience, but one can't help but think that if a man made a film in which all the female characters were nothing but gold-digging, abusive, sluts, there would be a serious, if well-deserved, backlash.Waitress is a good movie that is well worth seeing. It's tragic that Shelly, who was brutally murdered in November 2006, won't be making any further films, as this movie will no doubt bring awareness of the writer/director's impressive talents to a much wider audience than ever before. Fortunately, Waitress is a fitting memorial by which to be remembered.",4,Great.....now I'm hungry!,1200528000,"01 17, 2008",2008,2506,"['movie', 'almost', 'TV', 'sitcom', 'Alice', 'set', 'small', 'out-of-the-way', 'diner', 'run', 'cranky', 'head', 'cook', 'heart', 'gold', 'staffed', 'trio', 'waitresses', 'brash', 'Blondie', 'Southern', 'one', 'child-like', 'naive', 'one', 'level-headed', 'single', 'mom', 'mom-to-be', 'case', 'typical', 'assortment', 'wacky', 'colorful', 'customers', 'Writer/director', 'Adrienne', 'Shelly', 'take', 'template', 'make', 'something', 'wonderful', 'however', 'Far', 'being', 'mere', 'remake', 'Alice', 'Waitress', 'well-conceived', 'well-executed', 'exploration', 'one', 'woman', 'fight', 'come', 'own', 'realize', 'dreams', 'bad', 'choices', 'wrong', 'decisions', 'made', 'way', 'down.What', 'truly', 'sets', 'movie', 'apart', 'most', 'other', 'big-screen', 'fare', 'script', 'dialogue', 'written', 'Adrienne', 'Shelly', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'co-stars', 'Dawn', 'mousy', 'waitress', 'who', 'eventually', 'true', 'love', 'sparkles', 'wit', 'charm', 'humor', 'fast', 'funny', 'always', 'totally', 'natural', 'due', 'small', 'part', 'course', 'talents', 'actors', 'actresses', 'charged', 'delivering', 'writing', 'say', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'widely', 'praised', 'unique', 'character', 'dialogue', 'Waitress', 'never', 'forced', 'unnatural', 'brilliant', 'being', 'obtrusive.My', 'only', 'downsize', 'film', 'fact', 'men', 'are', 'dogs', 'message', 'little', 'heavy-handed', 'exception', 'male', 'characters', 'Waitress', 'are', 'presented', 'mean', 'Earl', 'Jeremy', 'Sisto', 'unprincipled', 'Dr.', 'Pomatter', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'just', 'plain', 'weird', 'Ogie', 'Eddie', 'Jemison', 'Even', 'Joe', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'truly', 'kind', 'caring', 'shown', 'most', 'film', 'be', 'abrasive', 'demanding', 'point', 'long-suffering', 'Jenna', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'can', 'deal', 'truly', 'only', 'friend', 'obviously', 'film', 'made', 'woman', 'primarily', 'female', 'audience', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'man', 'made', 'film', 'female', 'characters', 'were', 'nothing', 'gold-digging', 'abusive', 'sluts', 'would', 'be', 'serious', 'well-deserved', 'backlash.Waitress', 'good', 'movie', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'tragic', 'Shelly', 'who', 'was', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'November', '2006', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'making', 'further', 'films', 'movie', 'will', 'doubt', 'bring', 'awareness', 'writer/director', 'impressive', 'talents', 'much', 'wider', 'audience', 'ever', 'Fortunately', 'Waitress', 'fitting', 'memorial', 'be', 'remembered']",N/A

Pluntze, Jr. ""pluntze2001""","[1, 1]","I have to confess that I was more than a little late in discovering how undeniably talented writer-director-actress ADRIENNE SHELLY was until just a few years ago, when I finally got around to renting/watching ""Waitress"" -- a movie I enjoyed so much that I quickly looked Adrienne Shelly up on Wikipedia (to see what OTHER movies she might've made BEFORE ""Waitress"")!!I've now happily watched, at least once, Shelly's ""I'll Take You There"" and also her ""Serious Moonlight"" (the latter was adroitly directed, not by Shelly, but by ""Suburgatory""/""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" actress Cheryl Hines -- because Shelly was murdered in 2006 in her Manhattan apartment (at age 40, four years after she gave birth to her first daughter) by a 19-year-old illegal immigrant from Ecuador) ... and I just recently re-watched  ""WAITRESS"" again the other night.Shelly was both a TV and film actress for many years before she became either a screenwriter or a director, and in each of the movies she directed that I've seen so far (I just ordered Shelly's ""Sudden Manhattan"" from Amazon yesterday, but so far I haven't been able to find either ""Lois Lives On"" or that ""Zelda"" movie that Shelly wrote-directed-costarred in), she shows tremendous instincts for both choosing actors and also for getting uniformly superb performances FROM them.And that's never been MORE true than it is in ""Waitress"" -- which is both superbly cast and superbly acted (particularly by Keri Russell, Andy Griffith, Jeremy Sisto, Nathan Fillion and by Shelly herself), with a great feel for small-town life in the South as well.Films about struggling working-class women aren't exactly new (even before ""Norma Rae"" was released in 1979, there'd been scores of them already -- and there've heaps more SINCE then, too), but Shelly, both as a writer and as a director, infuses so much attention and care into the various characters in ""Waitress"", the movie seems very fresh, indeed (second only in freshness, perhaps, to the pies that Russell is regularly making in this movie, as her way of coping with increasingly-stressful situations).Unfortunately for me, what was once a VERY upbeat and encouraging ending in ""Waitress"" has since been irreparably ruined for me, after I learned (via Wikipedia) that the four-year-old girl whom Russell is happily holding in the the very last scene of ""Waitress"" is none other than ADRIENNE SHELLY'S FOUR-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER ... a girl who, sadly, will now grow up never knowing her mother.Well, at least she'll grow up knowing what a tenacious and talented actress, writer and director her mother was, anyway....More than a little infuriating and sad, that...",4,Another Radiant

Keri Russell's waitress character has a good heart and is basically likable, but she's a mess of conflicting emotions and desires as she moves into a particularly challenging crossroads of her life.  In fact, she can be so frustrating at times that we sometimes even feel bad for her abusive husband.  But ultimately we root for Ms. Russell's Jenna character to get on the right path, make the right choices, and find her way.This is an enjoyable, even haunting film (made more so by the tragic fate of its director and co-star, Adrienne Shelley), that's probably best described as a serious drama with a generous dose of comedy stirred in to make it all go down easier.

This is definitely a great ""snuggle on the couch together"" movie.WAITRESS is the story of Jenna, a waitress in a small southern pie shop in a small southern town.  Jenna invents and bakes delicious, original pies (for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert), all with crazy names, like I Hate My Husband Pie, Earl Murders Me Because I'm Having An Affair Pie, Marshmallow Mermaid Pie (invented when she was 10), Bad Baby Pie, and Falling in Love Pie, all which reflect what is happening in her life at that moment.  Jenna is unhappy in her marriage to her abusive husband Earl, and has discovered she's pregnant. Things get complicated and heated and even funny when she falls for her new doctor and he falls for her.WAITRESS is charming and poignant; it runs a gamut of emotions.  It is a relaxed, lazy film that slowly unfolds as layers of taste, texture, and intrigue are added.  Kerry Russell shines as Jenna, breathing life and love into the character.  Nathan Fillion is enchanting as Dr. Pomatter, her quirky, loveable doctor, bringing more than his typical charming self to this role.  The other cast members, including writer-director Adrienne Shelly, bring realism and warmth to WAITRESS.  And the cherry on the top of this scrumptious pie is Andy Griffith as Joe, the curmudgeonly owner of the pie shop, who grudgingly dispenses advice, wisdom, and poetry, but is really an old cream puff deep down.  Joe has a true affection and respect for Jenna, and he does what he can to help her overcome her lot in life.Sweet, fun, touching, and vibrant, WAITRESS is an unexpected movie that draws the audience in from beginning to end.  You care about these characters and want what is best for them.  And what is best may surprise you.

Yes, there are charming and funny Dr. Seussian - type moments.

It is referred to as a baby the entire movie. A few characters, all married, dabble in affairs. As disappointed as that made me, I appreciated that most of the characters knew their choices were wrong and hurtful.On a personal note, to give you insight into where I'm coming from, my marriage weathered an affair and I've seen the damage and I've experienced the life-changing damage, so I appreciated that even though the characters chose to go there, the wrongness/pain is acknowledged.Jenna (Keri Russell) is gut-level honest except to her abusive husband. The conflict rips and tears at her. She carries a baby she does not want or love. Pie-making and a handful of equally complex friends save her life.Some scenes are so poignant and/or painful I will remember them for a long time. Others were light-hearted and laugh out loud funny.

In TLPS you had Sam the Lion (Ben Johnson) a crusty old curmudgeon of a diner owner whose bequest changes the lives of everyone around him.

With all the junk out there, a little gem like ""Waitress"" comes around too rarely, unfortunately.A deli waitress, Keri Russell, finds herself stuck in an impossible situation with an abusive husband played superbly by Jeremy Sisto.  There appears to be no way out, no light at the end of the tunnel, no hope, and to top things off, she finds out she's pregnant. It is truly a bleak situation....But this film makes the viewer believe that hope exists--- that nothing is as bad as it appears, and sometimes, our most unique gifts will set us free. For example, the waitress's bakes decedent pies, pies she gives names to...such as, ""hate your husband's guts pie"" and ""light at the end of the tunnel pie, or ""sweet baby pie.""There is a scene, which has stayed with me.  When Russell comes to the realization that hope exists, that she doesn't need to stay in the abusive situation she's in, that there is something glittering on the other side, there is a smile that covers her entire face, and the viewer knows then----that she will leave.  It was gratifying being there to watch the transformation.The characters at the diner add to the pleasure of this film, and the waitress's doctor is included to show her the full potential she has within her.""Waitress"" is a diamond in the rough.

Kerri Russell will probably forever be tagged as TV'sFelicity - Senior Year Collection (The Complete Fourth Season).  As Jenna, she turns in a comic & varied performance that bounces between joy & despair, submissiveness & assertiveness.  Under director Adreienne Shelly's deft touch, the film handles the subject of domestic abuse with sensitivity and caring.Jeremy Sisto who will probably be remembered for his appearances on TV'sSix Feet Under - The Complete Third Seasonplays Jenna's controlling husband Earl.  I kept flashing on the Dixie Chicks' song, but it was never used in the film that has a great musical selections.  Sisto plays the role as a bruiser, but also with levels of dependency and desperation.  His selfish nature only buys into Jenna's pregnancy when she promises not to love the baby more than she loves him.  As she promises, the irony is that she does not love him at all and lives in complete fear.  Each time he grabs the money she makes from her, pulls up and demands that she meet his needs, as an audience we cringe.As I watched the movie, I did not know that the waitress Dawn was also the film's director or that she was murdered before the film's release.  These real-life events give the film a haunting feel.  Shelly's performance is affecting as the girl who wants love so badly that she sets up five-minute dates so she won't be disappointed.Nathan Fillion who was in ""Slither"" and six episodes of the TV series ""Drive"" this year plays Dr. Pomatter who finds himself irresistibly attracted to Jenna.  The sparks that fly between the two put a smile on our face, despite the fact that we are watching two married people carry on an affair.  Again, Shelly's touch is magical as a subject that should not be funny or romantic is given such a human face that we find ourselves drawn into their world.Cheryl Hines from the filmCake& TV's ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" plays the third waitress, Becky.  She has one of those amazing smiles and embraces the character lovingly.  The theme of an affair is repeated again as we find that Becky cares for a disabled spouse and finds a little secret joy.North Carolina favorite Andy Griffith plays Old Joe who owns the pie shop.  His banter with Jenna shows a crusty old geezer who observantly dispenses advice.  It is an excellent cameo that could provide a sentimental dark horse Oscar nomination.  Lew Temple who was in ""Domino"" plays the diner manager Cal who badgers the waitresses every time they head to the bathroom to discuss matters.  Shelly gives him some touching levels as we see the scene where he dispenses his philosophy of life to Jenna.  Eddie Jemison who has been in all the Ocean's films (11, 12 & 13) almost steals the show as the oddball romancer Ogie whose on-the-spot poetry is hysterically touching and awful at the same time.  Shelly's screenplay reveals so many levels for each of the characters that we feel like we have been dropped into their real-world universe.  This excellent small-budget film deserves great rewards at the box office.

I also remember hearing about the violent murder of its writer/director Adrienne Shelly in her Greenwich Village office shortly before the film was released.  Knowing this, watching this film had a bittersweet sadness about it.  The word ""bittersweet"" is a good word to describe the film as well.  It's actually tagged a ""comedy/drama/romance"" and that it is, although the comedy part is not ""laugh out loud"" but the ""chuckle"" kind that lifts the drama above the plight which the heroine is experiencing.  This independent film defies categorization and has won quite a few awards.The heroine, Jenna, is played by Keri Russell.  She's a young woman with a gentle disposition who works as in a small town southern diner as waitress and is married to a bully of a husband.  She's unhappy in her marriage and becomes even more unhappy when she becomes pregnant.  Her women friends at the diner sympathize with her and add a little humor to the situation.  Dawn (played by the director/writer herself, Adrienne Shelly), is shy and unattractive until she meets a man who adores her and constantly writes bad poetry to honor her.  Another fellow waitress, Becky, is married to an invalid husband and is driven to an affair with her sour faced boss.  A theme of the film is that Jenna is an expert pie-maker and specializes in mixing unusual ingredients with a delicious result.  This is also the theme of the film. And it works beautifully.When Jenna goes to the doctor regarding her pregnancy, she discovers that her female gynecologist has retired and that a young attractive male doctor has taken her place.  There's immediate chemistry between Jenna and the doctor and soon they are embraced in a hot romance of their own.  He's married too and they are both confused about this but can't seem to stop.  In the meantime Jenna is getting more and more pregnant and her husband comes across as more and more of a brute. The owner of the diner is played by Andy Griffin.  He gives a fine performance as the elderly gentleman who eats breakfast at the diner each morning and gives very demanding orders to the waitresses.  He soon befriends the unhappy Jenna and even finds out about her affair.How this all plays out is a masterpiece of writing.  None of it seems contrived the pacing of the film makes it flow.  There wasn't one moment that I was bored, which is very unusual for me, especially in a ""comedy"".Needless to say, there is a happy ending and I was smiling at the end of the film.",5,"Like a perfect pie, mixing unusual ingredients has a delicious result",1215302400,"07 6, 2008",2008,2541,"['remember', 'hearing', 'good', 'things', '2007', 'film', 'also', 'remember', 'hearing', 'violent', 'murder', 'writer/director', 'Adrienne', 'Shelly', 'Greenwich', 'Village', 'office', 'shortly', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'Knowing', 'watching', 'film', 'had', 'bittersweet', 'sadness', 'word', 'bittersweet', 'good', 'word', 'describe', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'actually', 'tagged', 'comedy/drama/romance', 'comedy', 'part', 'not', 'out', 'loud', 'chuckle', 'kind', 'drama', 'plight', 'heroine', 'experiencing', 'independent', 'film', 'defies', 'categorization', 'won', 'quite', 'few', 'awards.The', 'heroine', 'Jenna', 'played', 'Keri', 'Russell', 'young', 'woman', 'gentle', 'disposition', 'who', 'as', 'small', 'town', 'southern', 'diner', 'waitress', 'married', 'bully', 'husband', 'unhappy', 'marriage', 'even', 'more', 'unhappy', 'when', 'pregnant', 'women', 'friends', 'diner', 'sympathize', 'add', 'little', 'humor', 'situation', 'Dawn', 'played', 'director/writer', 'Adrienne', 'Shelly', 'shy', 'unattractive', 'man', 'who', 'constantly', 'bad', 'poetry', 'honor', 'fellow', 'waitress', 'Becky', 'married', 'invalid', 'husband', 'driven', 'affair', 'sour', 'faced', 'boss', 'theme', 'film', 'Jenna', 'expert', 'pie-maker', 'mixing', 'unusual', 'ingredients', 'delicious', 'result', 'also', 'theme', 'film', 'beautifully.When', 'Jenna', 'doctor', 'regarding', 'pregnancy', 'female', 'gynecologist', 'retired', 'young', 'attractive', 'male', 'doctor', 'taken', 'place', 'immediate', 'chemistry', 'Jenna', 'doctor', 'soon', 'are', 'embraced', 'hot', 'romance', 'own', 'married', 'too', 'are', 'confused', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'stop', 'meantime', 'Jenna', 'getting', 'more', 'more', 'pregnant', 'husband', 'more', 'more', 'brute', 'owner', 'diner', 'played', 'Andy', 'Griffin', 'fine', 'performance', 'elderly', 'gentleman', 'who', 'breakfast', 'diner', 'morning', 'very', 'demanding', 'orders', 'waitresses', 'soon', 'unhappy', 'Jenna', 'even', 'out', 'affair.How', 'out', 'masterpiece', 'writing', 'None', 'contrived', 'pacing', 'film', 'flow', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'moment', 'was', 'bored', 'very', 'unusual', 'especially', 'comedy', '.Needless', 'say', 'happy', 'ending', 'was', 'smiling', 'end', 'film']",N/A

Sherwin,"[4, 5]","Waitress is indeed a frank, touching and sometimes painful look at how life really is for Jenna, a young woman stuck in a loveless marriage to Earl--and pregnant. Jenna has two real friends who waitress with her at the diner, Becky (Cheryl Hines) and Dawn (Adrienne Shelly). The plot moves along at a good pace and the convincing acting impressed me very much.The action begins when Jenna and her friends find out (in the washroom of the diner) that Jenna is pregnant by her ""I'm a not so nice guy but I'm also complicated"" husband, Earl. Jenna (Keri Russell) is horrified because now she fears it will be next to impossible to escape from her abusive, egotistical, sensitive husband Earl (Jeremy Sisto). Jenna's life becomes far more complicated when she impulsively starts an affair with her gynecologist/obstetrician, Dr. Pomatter (Nathan Fillion).Jenna is only happy when she makes pies or fools around with Dr. Pomatter; and she knows that her life is in trouble. She can't risk Earl finding out about her affair with the doctor--he'll kill them; and she finds escaping from her marriage to Earl ever more difficult. Earl is a needy guy and somewhat vulnerable at heart but he behaves like such a brute that you sympathize with Jenna's desire to leave him.Meanwhile, ""Old Joe"" (Andy Griffith), the crusty old owner of the diner where Jenna and her friends work, has his own realistic and complicated relationship with Jenna. While on the surface Joe bosses Jenna around and gets ridiculously fussy about his order for lunch, we eventually see a softer side to Joe and a heart of true compassion that is very touching.Of course, the plot can go anywhere from here. Will Jenna play it safe and remain miserable in her marriage to Earl? Will Earl ever find out about her affair with her doctor? What about the other two waitresses--Dawn and Becky--how will things go for them? No spoilers here, folks, you'll just have to watch the movie to find out.The cinematography is very well done in the diner scenes; and the choreography works well in the wedding scene, too.The DVD comes with a number of extras. There's a commentary, a look at how they made this film and a touching memorial to Adrienne Shelly who was tragically murdered shortly after the film was finished.Waitress is a very good film. It gives us an honest and refreshing look at life in a way we don't frequently see. We see people making good and bad decisions; and ultimately the film leaves you with an important message about life.

Keri Russell delivers the performance of her career as a frank and frankly unhappy small-town Southern woman. Jenna (Keri Russell) is a waitress and star pie chef at Joe's Pie Diner, where best friends Becky (Cheryl Hines) and Dawn (Adrienne Shelly) also wait tables. Jenna dreams often of new pies and of escaping her self-obsessed, controlling husband Earl (Jeremy Sisto). She's annoyed to find herself pregnant and resents the idea of her impending motherhood. But Jenna finds unexpected romance and companionship with her new doctor Jim Pomatter (Nathan Fillion).""Waitress"" finds a remarkable and surprising tone. Writer/director Adrienne Shelly takes a humorous perspective on life's shortcomings and on her characters' relationships, good and bad. Jenna doesn't like being pregnant and hates her abusive husband. This could be the stuff of melodrama, or worse, preachy. But ""Waitress"" had me laughing out loud while never losing sympathy for Jenna's predicament. The quirky cast of characters doesn't seem self-conscious, because they demonstrate genuine affection for each other, including a nice turn by veteran Andy Griffith as the diner's curmudgeonly owner. It's sad that Adrienne Shelly didn't live to see the film's success, because ""Waitress"" demonstrates great originality and wit with potentially touchy and tired material.The DVD (20th Century Fox 2007): ""This is How We Made Waitress Pie"" (10 min) interviews director, cast, and producer Michael Rioff about the film's characters and relationships. In ""Written and Directed by Adrienne Shelly: A Memorial"" (7 min), cast and producer Rioff talk about working with the director. ""Hi! I'm Keri, I'll Be Your Waitress"" (6 min) interviews Keri Russell about Jenna, the film, and its reception. ""The Pies Have It!""

He is also abusive and controlling. She finds herself pregnant, a fact she is not very happy about. I guess she fears she may not be a good mother and that it is not fair to any kid to have a father like Earl, who made her promise that she would not love a baby more than him. A new gynecologist, Jim, is treating her and they start an affair. One catch, he is married and so is she.Russell's character makes really good, should-be-in-an-award-show-pies. She uses the pies to express how she feels at the moment and the events that are happening in her life.Russell's character wants to escape from her marriage and start anew.There is something about this movie that made me not like it very much: the over-the-top acting, the dialogue and the characters themselves. The movie was unconvincing, the dialogue was unrealistic and the acting wasn't great. The film, and the actors, seemed jaded, emotionally stunted and this caused the plot to not carry out well. Maybe that was the point of the movie, how to draw the emotionally stunted Jenna out of her life and have her start anew.Basically, the movie reminds me of the literary genre of magical realism in that it uses certain objects, events and people in an exaggerated manner.

And all we are told to justify that is that he changed after the wedding. It is not remotely believable.And that is this movie's problem - it is not believable. Some writers have said that it is not believable because Keri Russell is too beautiful to be working in a pie shop. But she's the best thing in the movie, and the angst and pain that wash across her face show she is very much more than a pretty TV star. Adrienne Shelly wrote the role for herself, but probably couldn't get financing. All the casting works fine. The problem is that the core of the story is a big lie.

In Waitress, Keri Russell plays Jenna, a small-town Southern woman stuck in a loveless marriage. Her control-freak husband won't buy her a car (he doesn't want her to go anywhere), and he systematically collects her paycheck and tips each week so she won't have enough money to leave him.In addition to waiting tables at Joe's Pie Shop, Jenna creates a daily special pie. All of her pies are delicious (her co-workers call her a ""pie genius""), and they all have quirky names like ""Spanish Dancer Pie,"" ""Bad Baby Pie,"" and ""Kick in the Pants Pie."" Jenna loves making pies, and it's her dream to attend a pie cook-off and take first prize.At the beginning of the movie, Jenna learns that she's pregnant. And though she's keeping the baby, she's pretty miserable about it. When she goes in to her obgyn to confirm the news, she discovers that her staid old doctor has been replaced. Her new doctor is a young, hot, GUY. Dr. Pomatter (played adorably by Nathan Fillion) is immediately attracted to Jenna, and before long, the two are enjoying a torrid affair.As her relationship with Dr. Pomatter develops, Jenna begins to understand some things about herself and her life. She realizes that maybe she doesn't have to be stuck with her abusive husband. And that maybe her pie-making isn't just playing, but her own unique form of artistry.This is a wonderful film.

1105601,A10X0JN8KTK89H,B000VY1EYG,ninjasuperstar,"[3, 4]","The success of this film comes from the great acting, strong characters, and small scale of the plot.  Briefly, the film details a series of small-town happenings surrounding the waitresses of a pie shop, with a particular close-up on a newly pregnant waitress, Jenna (played by Keri Russell).  The people who surround her at first come off as Deep South cartoons, but the audience comes to sympathize with them fairly quickly, and that sympathy is sustained throughout the picture.I was particularly impressed with Andy Griffith's gruff comic performance as Old Joe.  As I was watching the film, I wondered why he hadn't made different career choices.  He has the same wisdom of character as Henry Fonda, yet Griffith has too often played country-fried characters.  Certainly, Old Joe is deep-fried, but he knows it and is reflective.  He knows that he has made poor decisions, and he knows how he could have lived differently.Jeremy Sisto's portrayal of Earl, Jenna's husband, is reminiscent of his work on Six Feet Under.  Sisto has perfected the neurotic, desperate, man-boy performance.  As on Six Feet Under, he is exhausting to watch for a long time, because he demands so much attention, much like a child.  I credit Sisto for making the audience sympathize (if only briefly) with Earl's ignorance of what it means to be a man and a husband.Nathan Fillion's performance of Dr. Pomatter is similar to Sisto's Earl.  They are both weird, bad husbands and confused men.  While Earl seems dangerous, Dr. Pomatter comes off as sweet.  The proximity of sweetness and jealousy is rather eerie, now that I think about it.Keri Russell is the film's protagonist, the great pie-making waitress.  She is the mold that girls-next-door are made from.  She's poor, pregnant, has a new doctor, the same manic husband, and all she wants to do is escape all of them.  The film is her story, her adventure.  She moves through a weird world as gracefully as she can.It might be worth pointing out the morality of this film, what Old Joe calls ""indiscretions.""  I think the movie is more amoral than it is moral or immoral.  The point of the plot isn't to expose a woman who strays from the path only to find her way to righteousness, nor is the film about taking joy in infidelity and disloyalty.  All of those things are thrown up in the air and allowed to settle where they may, with Jenna standing before them, offering us a good old fashioned pie and a different twist to a familiar tale.",4,Waitress is the alternative romantic comedy,1182038400,"06 17, 2007",2007,2480,"['success', 'film', 'great', 'acting', 'strong', 'characters', 'small', 'scale', 'plot', 'Briefly', 'film', 'details', 'series', 'small-town', 'happenings', 'surrounding', 'waitresses', 'pie', 'shop', 'particular', 'close-up', 'newly', 'pregnant', 'waitress', 'Jenna', 'played', 'Keri', 'Russell', 'people', 'who', 'surround', 'first', 'come', 'off', 'Deep', 'South', 'cartoons', 'audience', 'sympathize', 'fairly', 'quickly', 'sympathy', 'sustained', 'picture.I', 'was', 'particularly', 'impressed', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'gruff', 'comic', 'performance', 'Old', 'Joe', 'was', 'watching', 'film', 'wondered', 'why', 'had', ""n't"", 'made', 'different', 'career', 'choices', 'same', 'wisdom', 'character', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'yet', 'Griffith', 'too', 'often', 'played', 'country-fried', 'characters', 'Certainly', 'Old', 'Joe', 'deep-fried', 'reflective', 'made', 'poor', 'decisions', 'how', 'could', 'have', 'lived', 'differently.Jeremy', 'Sisto', 'portrayal', 'Earl', 'Jenna', 'husband', 'reminiscent', 'work', 'Six', 'Feet', 'Sisto', 'perfected', 'neurotic', 'desperate', 'man-boy', 'performance', 'Six', 'Feet', 'exhausting', 'watch', 'long', 'time', 'so', 'much', 'attention', 'much', 'child', 'credit', 'Sisto', 'making', 'audience', 'sympathize', 'only', 'briefly', 'Earl', 'ignorance', 'what', 'be', 'man', 'husband.Nathan', 'Fillion', 'performance', 'Dr.', 'Pomatter', 'similar', 'Sisto', 'Earl', 'are', 'weird', 'bad', 'husbands', 'confused', 'men', 'Earl', 'dangerous', 'Dr.', 'Pomatter', 'off', 'sweet', 'proximity', 'sweetness', 'jealousy', 'rather', 'eerie', 'now', 'think', 'it.Keri', 'Russell', 'film', 'protagonist', 'great', 'pie-making', 'waitress', 'mold', 'girls-next-door', 'are', 'made', 'poor', 'pregnant', 'new', 'doctor', 'same', 'manic', 'husband', 'do', 'escape', 'film', 'story', 'adventure', 'weird', 'world', 'as', 'gracefully', 'can.It', 'might', 'be', 'worth', 'pointing', 'out', 'morality', 'film', 'what', 'Old', 'Joe', 'indiscretions', 'think', 'movie', 'more', 'amoral', 'moral', 'immoral', 'point', 'plot', ""n't"", 'expose', 'woman', 'who', 'path', 'only', 'find', 'way', 'righteousness', 'film', 'taking', 'joy', 'infidelity', 'disloyalty', 'things', 'are', 'thrown', 'up', 'air', 'allowed', 'settle', 'where', 'may', 'Jenna', 'standing', 'offering', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'pie', 'different', 'twist', 'familiar', 'tale']",N/A
1105602,A3KR9Q99D1EGEB,B000VY1EYG,"Odysseus ""A Traveller""","[25, 52]","Waitress isn't the worst film I've ever seen.  But after thinking the question over very carefully, I've decided it's the third worst film I've seen, of about 50, over the past two years.  It is pretty wretched.The film only mildly annoys in its first half hour; its worst transgression appears to be the kind of stilted, someone-thinks-this-is-clever-but-it-really-isn't dialogue that afflicts the typical HBO series (think Sex and the City.)But before too much time has passed, the sorry predictability of the film's plot devices starts embedding itself, one clich&eacute; at a time, into the viewer's increasingly maddened brain.  It's immediately obvious who the protagonist's forbidden love interest will be, seconds after introduction.  It's immediately obvious that the crusty old curmudgeon will turn out to have a heart of gold.  And it's distressingly obvious that the sniveling wuss of a suitor will, despite a horrific initial impression, win over his love interest.If those all sound like cartoony stereotypes to you, then you already have some insight into other problems with Waitress.  Characters aren't developed in multiple dimensions.  The older waitress, played by Cheryl Hines, is a hardbitten ""Flo"" knockoff (from the sitcom ""Alice."")  The younger one, played by the director, is an insecure ugly-duckling type. Not much more to either than that.The worst stereotyping is visited upon the men.  The protagonists's husband is a knuckle-dragging mouth-breathing abuser. The guy running the diner is also lifted from ""Alice"" - pure surliness.  Andy Griffith plays the secretly-sweet old curmudgeon.  Indeed, there is a disturbing adolescent sexism that runs throughout the film;  men exist there solely to provide certain fodder for the women, either fear/oppression (Kerri Russell's husband), financial support (Andy Griffith and the diner boss), servile adoration (the wuss suitor), or romantic excitement (the doctor).  Gross and one-dimensional though the male characters are, one can't help but be more disturbed by the attitudes of the film itself - that it's absurd to think that men are mental or emotional equals with desires and needs as worthy of respect and compromise as are those of the female protagonist.  (The arrival of a female daughter, though -- that is depicted as delivering the very meaning of life itself.)Where the film completely goes off the rails is in its implausible and sudden reversals of situation and character.  It might be compelling if a character with some ambivalence and anxiety about parenting were won over to its joys with a mix of pain and rewards.  But no - we instead get a sudden 180 switch from complete, nearly inhuman indifference towards one's prenatal child, to utter adoration, all in one sudden moment.  Similarly, we go from a character's being utterly helpless and trapped in an abusive relationship, to dismissing her tormentor with nothing more than a few sharp words (thoroughly implausible given that the husband no doubt had a contestable legal claim to custody of the child).  In another bizarrely unbelievable plot twist, one character is plopped into a scene late in the film for no other reason so that he can promptly die and bequeath a boatload of money to another.  Such moments robbed the film of all believability.The film's cavalier attitude towards adultery is chilling.  Many characters in the film cheat on their spouses, and there are no consequences other than a ""Gee, maybe I shouldn't do that.""  Adultery is treated only as a mis-step on the road to self-discovery instead of the potentially life-destroying event that it is. The film tries to evad ethe moral implications by either keeping some of the victims out of sight completely (like the diner owner's wife), or nearly completely (the doctor's wife, seen only for a few seconds), or by depicting them as unsuitable spouses (Cheryl Hines's invalid husband, Kerri Russell's abusive one).  The film makes sure no adulterer is ever caught, so there are no terrible consequences seen other than an awkward pang here or there.These perverse depictions result in several scenes that are spectacular failures.  One scene in the kitchen between the protagonist and her doctor/lover is supposed to a romantic, sensual sharing moment.  But it doesn't work that way, because it takes place in her kitchen - the very kitchen she inhabits with the evil husband who has been depicted throughout as a violent abuser.  In the juvenile universe of this film, you're supposed to enjoy this as a tender, romantic scene, and not worry about the possibility that this guy might be barging through the door at any second.  Viewer haunted by a sense of reality, on the other hand, will spend the whole time marveling at the stupid implausibility of the scene.An even worse failure is the idiotic scene where Kerri Russell ends one scene with the doctor with an expression of shocked surprise on her face. Nothing in that scene really justifies her ending the scene with that frozen expression, so when you go through a series of cuts to other scenes with her holding that same expression, it feels as contrived and sophomoric as it truly is. Then her expression dissolves into a giddy grin, and THAT expression is held through several more cuts, as she revels in the joy of her new libidinous relationship with the doctor.  The whole montage is just shockingly clumsy; it doesn't work, and should have been left on the cutting room floor.Predictability, implausibility, annoying dialogue, one-dimensional stereotypes, sexism, and self-indulgence - that's pretty much Waitress in a nutshell.  It may not be the worst film you'll ever see - but it's bound to be close.",1,"I Am the Waitress -- Superficial, Narcissistic, Predictable -- Goo Goo Goo Joob",1220227200,"09 1,

Jenna is trapped in a marriage to Earl (Jeremy Sisto) who is an abusive, controlling person. Jenna deals with her frustrations and life problems by creating new pies for the diner where she works. Jenna has a plan to enter a pie baking contest and to run away with the prize money until she finds out she is pregnant with Earl's baby.This movie was poor on so many levels. The only saving grace for me was Keri Russell and that she is still as attractive as she was when she played Felicity.The Good: Besides Keri Russell, there were a few heart warming spots and a laugh here and there but that is about it.The Bad: Character problems. I found it hard to identify with and or root for or against any of the characters. Keri's character is a person who is afraid to leave an abusive situation. Dr. Pomatter (Nathan Fillon), an OB Gyn, who is cheating on his wife with a waitress, Cheryl Hines and Adrienne Shelly play waitress's right out of your local waffle house and Earl an abusive controlling husband. I just wasn't interested.The story and characters weren't believable. Jenna is 5'4"" and weighs about 110lbs and I am supposed to believe that she makes pies all the time? Dr. Pomatter has a wife in Medical school and is willing to risk his career and wife to have an affair with a pregnant waitress?

From the grumpy old man with a sweet spot in his heart for waitress Jenna, to Jenna's quirky pie-making, to Adrienne Shelley's character Dawn, everything just worked together so well.  While it's not a complex movie (the theme of it is fairly straightforward), the way all the little plots come together makes an aspiring writer like me a little jealous!While ""Waitress"" is definitely a ""feel good movie,"" it also avoids some of those cliches.  Darker themes are touched on in Jenna's relationship with her husband, but at the same time we never get any of those forced ""Lifetime movie"" moments.  Instead, we see these characters develop and grow throughout this little movie, giving us a little surprise at every turn.

She has never been truly appreciated -- especially by her controlling husband -- despite her talent. Jenna makes pie.

But if you watch it, you will find a more uplifting and empowering story about a woman who is finally ready to do things that make her happy.The movie had its rough spots just about any time Jeremy Sisto was on screen. He played the controlling husband and his scenes were hard to watch. I have noticed that there is a distinct category of people who did not like this movie based solely on Sisto's character. I find that unfortunate since there was a very charming story here, but I can appreciate the viewpoint of anyone who fits that category.Waitress was very well written. There were many great lines delivered by various members of the cast, but Andy Griffith stole the show. He played Old Joe, the man who owned the pie diner where Jenna worked.

The way they go back and forth with wit, humor, and a little bit of insight is like a play.  Adrienne Shelley's script is brilliant from start to finish.But don't let the DVD cover fool you.  This is not your typical romantic comedy/drama.  The cover might overplay the romance a little bit.  The film is about what it takes for one person to gather up the courage to disover what she wants in her life, instead of letting others do it for her.Jenna is faced with an abusive relationship with her husband, Earl, who makes Jenna promise that she love him more than the baby.  She also has an affair with her quirky doctor, who himself is married.  While trying to figure out what to do with these relationships, she gains a certain amount of respect from old Joe, the owner of the diner where she works, played brilliantly by Andy Griffith.  Throughout the film, he gives Jenna advice and undeniable truths she has to face, even though she wants to hear none of it.The winning script makes this film worth watching.  It's a feel good movie that doesn't slip into the pitfalls of the romantic comedy genre and has a rather unique uplifting conclusion.

It's simply wonderful.'Waitress' defies easy description or categorization, because its not just a romantic comedy, not just a drama, not just an 'indie' film, but it has elements of all of these things and uses them in excellent balance.Where most romantic movies opt for the cheese factor and depend heavily on stereotypes, 'Waitress' tells it like it is.  Where most modern comedies try to eke out laughs based on cynicism and sarcasm, 'Waitress' finds the real humor in everyday things. Where many independent movies try too hard to prove how weird they can get, 'Waitress' keeps it real and tells a story that could come out of just about anyone's back yard.So much of this file depends on the strength of the characters, and fortunately the cast is just great. Keri Russell was perfect to play the lead role of Jenna, striking just the right balance of world-weariness and hope. Jeremy Sisto turns in a surprisingly well-rounded and subtle performance as Jenna's poor excuse of a husband, a role which could have easily devolved into stereotype but doesn't. Nathan Fillion is wonderfully goofy as Jenna's new doctor -- the chemistry between Russell and Fillion is as natural as it can be. The story is filled in with some excellent supporting characters as well, each of which feels just right, though my favorite among them has to be Andy Griffith as the curmudgeonly owner of the pie diner where Jenna works.The best advice I can give you is this: watch 'Waitress' with an open mind and be ready for anything.

1105621,A9MOZDD4DO6FY,B000VY1EYG,"Robert M. Penna ""Dr. Bob""","[2, 2]","On November 2, 2006, I picked up the New York Post to read, in one of its typically lurid headlines, of the death of a local actress the day before...my birthday.  Shortly thereafter, NYPD had their man and the ""suicide"" of Adrienne Shelly was learned to be, in fact, a senseless, tragic and all too typical murder.It is a good thing for the man eventually convicted that the law does not account for the quality of a crime victim and demand an extra pound of flesh when he or she is a person of exceptional talent.  For such was Shelly, and this comes through unquestioningly in all facets of this remarkable little film, which she wrote, directed, and in which she has a central supporting role.""Waitress"" is, at its heart, the story of the Ugly Duckling. The perky Kerri  Russell plays ""Jenna,"" a waitress in a dead end job in a dead end town, and a dead end marriage.  But while neither she nor her oafish, miserable, and pathetic lout of a husband can see it, underneath the stifled and abused faade of this small town Southern girl going nowhere is the spirited heart of a star.  No, it is not the Big Screen, Broadway, or American Idol that eventually represent her deliverance, but rather her unearthly talent at pie baking.Already depressed at her circumstances, she is driven to despair by an unwanted pregnancy, the product of ""doing something stupid like sleeping with [her] husband.""  She becomes even more unhinged by revolting circumstance when her familiar GP is found to have been replaced by a handsome-but-married new young doctor.  Where she is all defensive edges, his professional boundaries melt completely as he is captivated by the ember of the spirit he discerns still glowing layers under her downtrodden exterior.  Against all wisdom and all odds, they speed (not without a few comical bumps) 90 mph down the dead end road of an affair.The genius of this film, however, lies not in a fairly mundane and even predictable story, but rather in the performances and inspired direction Shelly brought to the film.  Using Jenna's endless inspiration for new pies as one of two access points into the character's thoughts and soul (the other is an ongoing mental letter to her as yet unborn baby) Shelly weaves a personal narrative that is funny, touching and incredibly more effective than any exposition.While Ms. Russell's performance is quite good, it is actually almost overshadowed by those of Jeremy Sisto as the despicable husband, and of Shelly herself as ""Dawn,"" one of Jenna's similarly dead ended coworkers.  An additional pleasant surprise is Andy Griffith's portrayal of the local curmudgeon, part Sherriff Taylor, part Matlock, and all right on target.While the feel good ending is predictable, improbable and downright garish (Shelly shifts the film's entire color scheme for the final scenes) it somehow all just works.More than a crime that Shelly's life was ended when it was, before she ever got to see her film's success, it was a sin against both American culture and film-making.  We were robbed of her obvious talents way to early, for if this film is any indication, she would have gone on to greater and more significant successes.  We can only be thankful that she left us at least this gem as a hint of what might have been.",5,"I'll have another helping, please.",1201737600,"01 31, 2008",2008,3273,"['November', '2', '2006', 'picked', 'up', 'New', 'York', 'Post', 'read', 'one', 'typically', 'lurid', 'headlines', 'death', 'local', 'actress', 'day', 'birthday', 'Shortly', 'thereafter', 'NYPD', 'had', 'man', 'suicide', 'Adrienne', 'Shelly', 'was', 'learned', 'be', 'fact', 'senseless', 'tragic', 'too', 'typical', 'murder.It', 'good', 'thing', 'man', 'eventually', 'convicted', 'law', 'not', 'account', 'quality', 'crime', 'victim', 'demand', 'extra', 'pound', 'flesh', 'when', 'person', 'exceptional', 'talent', 'such', 'was', 'Shelly', 'through', 'unquestioningly', 'facets', 'remarkable', 'little', 'film', 'wrote', 'directed', 'central', 'supporting', 'role', 'Waitress', 'heart', 'story', 'Ugly', 'Duckling', 'perky', 'Kerri', 'Russell', 'Jenna', 'waitress', 'dead', 'end', 'job', 'dead', 'end', 'town', 'dead', 'end', 'marriage', 'oafish', 'miserable', 'pathetic', 'lout', 'husband', 'can', 'see', 'stifled', 'abused', 'faade', 'small', 'town', 'Southern', 'girl', 'going', 'nowhere', 'spirited', 'heart', 'star', 'No', 'not', 'Big', 'Screen', 'Broadway', 'American', 'Idol', 'eventually', 'represent', 'deliverance', 'rather', 'unearthly', 'talent', 'pie', 'baking.Already', 'depressed', 'circumstances', 'driven', 'despair', 'unwanted', 'pregnancy', 'product', 'doing', 'something', 'stupid', 'sleeping', '[', ']', 'husband', 'even', 'more', 'unhinged', 'revolting', 'circumstance', 'when', 'familiar', 'GP', 'found', 'have', 'been', 'replaced', 'handsome-but-married', 'new', 'young', 'doctor', 'Where', 'defensive', 'edges', 'professional', 'boundaries', 'melt', 'completely', 'captivated', 'ember', 'spirit', 'still', 'glowing', 'layers', 'downtrodden', 'exterior', 'wisdom', 'odds', 'speed', 'not', 'few', 'comical', 'bumps', '90', 'mph', 'dead', 'end', 'road', 'affair.The', 'genius', 'film', 'however', 'not', 'fairly', 'mundane', 'even', 'predictable', 'story', 'rather', 'performances', 'inspired', 'direction', 'Shelly', 'brought', 'film', 'Using', 'Jenna', 'endless', 'inspiration', 'new', 'pies', 'one', 'two', 'access', 'points', 'character', 'thoughts', 'soul', 'other', 'ongoing', 'mental', 'letter', 'yet', 'unborn', 'baby', 'Shelly', 'personal', 'narrative', 'funny', 'touching', 'incredibly', 'more', 'effective', 'exposition.While', 'Ms.', 'Russell', 'performance', 'quite', 'good', 'actually', 'almost', 'overshadowed', 'Jeremy', 'Sisto', 'despicable', 'husband', 'Shelly', 'Dawn', 'one', 'Jenna', 'similarly', 'dead', 'ended', 'coworkers', 'additional', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'portrayal', 'local', 'curmudgeon', 'part', 'Sherriff', 'Taylor', 'part', 'Matlock', 'right', 'feel', 'good', 'ending', 'predictable', 'improbable', 'downright', 'garish', 'Shelly', 'film', 'entire', 'color', 'scheme', 'final', 'scenes', 'somehow', 'just', 'works.More', 'crime', 'Shelly', 'life', 'was', 'ended', 'when', 'was', 'ever', 'got', 'see', 'film', 'success', 'was', 'sin', 'American', 'culture', 'film-making', 'were', 'robbed', 'obvious', 'talents', 'way', 'early', 'film', 'indication', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'greater', 'more', 'significant', 'successes', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'thankful', 'left', 'least', 'gem', 'hint', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been']",N/A

Zwick,"[1, 5]","Ever since she was a little girl, Jenna (Keri Russell) has been concocting world-class pie recipes - a different pie, in fact, for every mood and occasion that life has to offer.  Now, in her thirties, she finds herself stuck working as a waitress in somebody else's pie shop and trapped in a loveless marriage to a domineering and physically abusive lout named Earl.  And, oh yes, she also happens to be pregnant.This is the set-up for ""Waitress,"" a slick, low-budget independent romantic comedy that was one of the genuine sleeper hits of 2007.  It is also the movie that marked the final work of the gifted writer/director/co-star Adrienne Shelley who was tragically murdered by a burglar about six months prior to the release of the film.That morbid taint notwithstanding, ""Waitress"" is a generally amiable comedy that, despite its small town New England setting and naturalistic performances, isn't always as genuine and authentic as it needs to be to be effective.  The scenes between Jenna and her fellow waitresses (Shelley, Cheryl Hines) do have the ring of ""girl talk"" truth about them, but those involving Jenna and the dreamy young pediatrician who's just set up his practice in town come across as pure Hollywood contrivance and hokum.Russell has warmth and appeal as the deeply unhappy and conflicted Jenna, and she receives excellent support from Shelley and Hines as her encouraging and understanding co-workers and friends.  Nathan Fillion, however, makes for a rather bland love interest as the gallant and gorgeous - albeit married - Doctor Pomatter, while the truly talented Jeremy Sisto (""Six Feet Under"") struggles under the weight of a poorly written part as Jenna`s irredeemably smarmy and churlish husband - a character that's at least a half a dozen shades too dark for a comedy as innocuous and lighthearted in tone as this one is.  In fact, one of the major weaknesses in the script is its insistence on seeing its main male characters in two-dimensional rather than three-dimensional terms.  Of the actors, though, it is the venerable Andy Griffith who steals every scene he's in as the crusty but wise owner of the diner who sets Jenna straight on a thing or two regarding how she`s choosing to live her life.There's a nice fairy tale ending to leave you feeling uplifted and good about life - which is just about all one really asks for from a film such as this one, I guess.Be forewarned, however:  this movie is not recommended for anyone who is on a strict diet or who is in any way serious about reducing calories.",3,innate charm overcomes inconsistent tone,1250121600,"08 13, 2009",2009,2549,"['Ever', 'was', 'little', 'girl', 'Jenna', 'Keri', 'Russell', 'been', 'concocting', 'world-class', 'pie', 'different', 'pie', 'fact', 'mood', 'occasion', 'life', 'offer', 'Now', 'thirties', 'stuck', 'working', 'waitress', 'somebody', 'else', 'pie', 'shop', 'trapped', 'loveless', 'marriage', 'domineering', 'physically', 'abusive', 'lout', 'named', 'Earl', 'oh', 'yes', 'also', 'be', 'pregnant.This', 'set-up', 'Waitress', 'slick', 'low-budget', 'independent', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'was', 'one', 'genuine', 'sleeper', 'hits', '2007', 'also', 'movie', 'marked', 'final', 'work', 'gifted', 'writer/director/co-star', 'Adrienne', 'Shelley', 'who', 'was', 'tragically', 'murdered', 'burglar', 'six', 'months', 'prior', 'release', 'film.That', 'morbid', 'taint', 'notwithstanding', 'Waitress', 'generally', 'amiable', 'comedy', 'small', 'town', 'New', 'England', 'setting', 'naturalistic', 'performances', ""n't"", 'always', 'genuine', 'authentic', 'be', 'be', 'effective', 'scenes', 'Jenna', 'fellow', 'waitresses', 'Shelley', 'Cheryl', 'Hines', 'do', 'have', 'ring', 'girl', 'talk', 'truth', 'involving', 'Jenna', 'dreamy', 'young', 'pediatrician', 'who', 'just', 'set', 'up', 'practice', 'town', 'come', 'pure', 'Hollywood', 'contrivance', 'hokum.Russell', 'warmth', 'appeal', 'deeply', 'unhappy', 'conflicted', 'Jenna', 'excellent', 'support', 'Shelley', 'Hines', 'encouraging', 'understanding', 'co-workers', 'friends', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'however', 'rather', 'bland', 'love', 'interest', 'gallant', 'gorgeous', 'albeit', 'married', 'Doctor', 'Pomatter', 'truly', 'talented', 'Jeremy', 'Sisto', 'Six', 'Feet', 'weight', 'poorly', 'written', 'part', 'Jenna', 's', 'irredeemably', 'smarmy', 'churlish', 'husband', 'character', 'least', 'half', 'dozen', 'shades', 'too', 'dark', 'comedy', 'innocuous', 'lighthearted', 'tone', 'one', 'fact', 'one', 'major', 'weaknesses', 'script', 'insistence', 'seeing', 'main', 'male', 'characters', 'two-dimensional', 'rather', 'three-dimensional', 'terms', 'actors', 'though', 'venerable', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'who', 'scene', 'crusty', 'wise', 'owner', 'diner', 'who', 'Jenna', 'straight', 'thing', 'two', 'regarding', 'how', 's', 'choosing', 'live', 'life.There', 'nice', 'fairy', 'tale', 'ending', 'leave', 'feeling', 'uplifted', 'good', 'life', 'just', 'one', 'really', 'film', 'such', 'one', 'guess.Be', 'forewarned', 'however', 'movie', 'not', 'recommended', 'anyone', 'who', 'strict', 'diet', 'who', 'way', 'serious', 'reducing', 'calories']",N/A

I loved everything about this movie: the directing, acting, writing.  Let's start with the directing.  Just as Scorsese did in ""After Hours"" and Truffaut did in ""The 400 Blows,"" Shelly showed her heartfelt and artistic vision in ""Waitress.""  There's one particular scene sequence that comes to mind that exemplifies this vision.  It happens right after Jenna made love to Dr. Pomatter.  There's a silly afterglow on her face.  You see it when she's carrying trays in the restaurant.  You see it when she's making pies.  And you especially see it when she's sitting on a bench, waiting for the bus.  That look on her face and the way the film was cut with those quick scenes left a profound impact on the viewer.  You knew you were in a moment of brilliance.  You can just feel how happy and liberated Jenna felt at that moment in the movie.  Now let's talk about the acting.  Everyone was perfectly cast.  I liked how Jenna was cold as ice at the beginning of the movie, warm-hearted in the middle, and assertive by the end.  I liked how Dr. Pomatter was nervous at the beginning, calm in the middle, and love-struck by the end.  But the character I was impressed by the most was Earl.  Here is someone who could've been one-dimensional.  In most movies he would've been a real jerk with no redeeming qualities.  That's not the way Earl was portrayed in ""Waitress.""  Yeah he was a control freak with fits of temper.  But there was a reason for his unacceptable behavior: he was insecure and required constant approval by Jenna.  That scene in the restaurant where he broke into the wedding reception, I was sure he was going to beat the living crap out of Jenna.  Instead, he cries like a baby because he wants to know why Jenna hid money all over the house.  This scene--which brings up the terrific writing--exemplifies how this movie is not a cliche and very real to life.

1105639,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,B000VY1EYG,S. Schell,"[7, 10]","A conversation-starter at the Sundance Film Festival and a modest success at the box office, ""Waitress"" is a small tale about a small woman overcoming great odds.  Writer and director Adrienne Shelly wrote the screenplay for the film whilst pregnant with her first child Sophie and began filming in November of `05.  Principal photography wrapped three days before Christmas, a mere twenty days after it began.  With an overall budget of $2 million and Shelly directing and starring in the film while looking after her infant daughter with her husband Andy, she was a force to be reckoned with.Sadly, Shelly would never see the film to its fruition.  Only a year after ""Waitress"" began filming, she was murdered by a young Ecuadorian immigrant in her Manhattan home, leaving behind Andy, Sophie and a film career that might've been.  She was forty years old.  ""Waitress"" is Shelly's swan song, a work that would've opened people's eyes to her talents as a screenwriter and a film director.  It is unfortunate that she will only be appreciated now posthumously.The film begins with Jenna Hunterson (Russell) doing what she does best - making pies.  The kitchen is her oasis, a place where her sweet machinations come to life in the form of pies, quiches and tarts.  Her saccharine creations distract from the awful monotony of her life as a waitress at Joe's Pie Diner, not to mention an unwanted pregnancy for which her jerk of a husband Earl (Sisto) is responsible.  After a pregnancy test comes out positive, she makes an appointment with her family doctor only to discover she has left the practice and been replaced by Dr. Jim Pomatter (Fillion).  Unhappily married and unhappily pregnant more so, she begins having an affair with - of all people - her obstetrician.  Dr. Pomatter (whom she insists on calling by his professional name, even while she is sleeping with him) is a nervous and bumbling sweetheart who also happens to be married and he and Jenna literally stumble into love.  No sooner does she realize she's falling in love, Jenna starts pouring her passions into her pies, much in the same way that Tita did in ""Like Water For Chocolate"" (""Naughty Pumpkin Pie"").  All the while, Jenna grows ever larger and tries to plan her escape from Earl's clutches and take her pie-making to the next level while amusing herself with the romantic hang-ups of her co-workers Dawn (Shelly) and Becky (Hines) and putting up with persnickety Joe (Griffith), the diner's aging proprietor.There isn't even one bad performance here, no matter how small the part.  The standouts, of course, are Russell and the seasoned and celebrated Andy Griffith as Joe.  Russell's Jenna is almost a tragic heroine - poor but not broken, she is kind but willful, a seemingly meek woman with an irrepressible spirit.  Russell embodies her character physically and emotionally - her Jenna is heartbreakingly lovely inside and out, a petite beauty who is sad but resolute (""...though she be but little, she is fierce"") and has an admirably acidic sense of humor to boot.  Who else's sense of humor can also be admired is Griffith's curmudgeon Joe, one who cackles as he says that he ""loves living vicariously through the pain and suffering of others.""Sisto's Earl is a possessive jerk, a low-scale tyrant who underneath is incredibly insecure and needs constant reassurance of Jenna's commitment to him. Fillion's awkward Dr. Pomatter is completely endearing and the surrounding cast rounds out the wonderfully entertaining ensemble.

She is on the screen in nearly every scene and makes you really care about her and her pregnancy (unplanned). The father of her child - as played by Jeremy Sisto - is probably the one uninteresting character in the film but he's crucial to the plot.

Adrienne Shelly and Cheryl Hines play her fellow waitresses and best friends. Andy Griffith plays Joe, the owner and frequent patron. Jeremy Sisto plays abusive Earl. Nathan Fillon plays Dr. Pomatter, her obstetrician.The film has both comedic and dramatic moments. It's really a joy worth watching again and again.

It's a thing of beauty,"" Jenna is told by a regular customer of Joe's Diner when she produces another one of her tasty pies. The same goes for Waitress, the last movie to be written and directed by Adrienne Shelley before her death earlier this year.  When Jenna, a small town waitress unhappily married to the boorish and controlling Earl (Sisto), learns she's pregnant, the last thing she needs is to fall for her handsome gynaecologist Dr. Pomatter (Fillion). But fall in love she does, which, along with Earl's increasingly jealous nature, hampers her dreams of escape. Waitress is one of those films that'll get funnier with every viewing and the extremely quotable dialogue and hilarious character idiosyncrasies all point to the fact that this is a cult classic in-waiting. Russell wins me over very easily. Russell is surrounded by sound character actors whose performances elevate them above mere supporting roles: Fillion can deliver a line, Sisto shows us both sides of a childish husband but it's Matlock's Andy Griffith that's in scene-stealing form as the tell-it-like-it-is, foul-mouthed Southern gent.

1105646,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000VY1EYG,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[5, 14]","Jenna (Keri Russell), a waitress at a small town pie shop in the Deep South, is married to the worst guy in the world, Earl (Jeremy Sisto). To her dismay, she learns she is pregnant, the one time in recent history that she got drunk and had sex with her husband. Her only friends are the other two waitresses at the shop. Becky (Cheryl Hines, TV's ""Curb Your Enthusiasm""), a talkative woman married to a paraplegic, older man is the most demonstrative. She loves the guy, but she needs the affection of a man and has affairs. Dawn (the film's writer/ director Adrienne Shelly), is a shy woman who has been on one bad date too many. Together, these women give each other love and support and help each other through their problems. Jenna is also the baker, making the pies the shop sells. She has always had a knack for creating unusual, delicious pies. As she deals with the many problems in her life, she creates new pies, making them before our eyes, naming them after the troubles she has. Jenna is the only one of the three waitresses who will wait on Old Joe (Andy Griffith), the exacting owner of the pie shop. He comes in every day and places a meticulous order that he expects to be filled exactly as requested. He dictates when he wants his water and his orange juice and if something isn't right, he sends it back. After she learns she is pregnant, Jenna goes to her doctor and finds a new doctor; Dr. Pomatter (Nathan Fillion, TV's ""Drive"" and ""Firefly"") has taken over the practice. Dr. Pomatter has problems of his own and becomes attracted to Jenna.Written and directed by Adrienne Shelly, ""Waitress"" is a nice, pleasant little film. It is, perhaps, a bit too `corn pone' at times, too much so for its own good. But it is a pleasant enough little film to help while away a few hours.Unfortunately, Shelly, a veteran of many independent films, was murdered a few months before the film premiered at Sundance. And this has become the main talking point of the film. This sad event has little bearing on the film, or it's quality.""Waitress"" aims for a folksy-type of quality with a dash of modern day fairy tale thrown in. Keri Russell is very good and very believable as Jenna. Every moment she is on screen, we get little bits of her pain, her desperation, her escape through baking, her interest in the awkward Dr. Pomatter and more. It also seems completely natural that she would be the one person who can handle Old Joe. Facing many desperate feelings, she would naturally be kind to just about everyone she meets and Old Joe is no exception.As we watch Jenna bake, Russell shows how she developed through life. She recalls fond memories of baking and singing songs with her mother. She also reverently describes how her mother baked, clearly inheriting the skill. Everyone who tastes one of her pies seems transported by sheer bliss. All of this helps to balance her character and make her more believable.The first time Earl drives up, we get an instant vision of what he is like as a spouse. Driving up to the three waitresses sitting on the stoop of the pie shop, he honks the car's horn consistently. Here I am. Here I am. Look at me. And this serves to make Jenna more human, more interesting and more complex. She is trapped in her relationship with needy Earl and can't get out. During their conversations, he consistently reminds her that he ""put the roof over her head""; he ""provides everything for her."" They are really co-dependent on each other. It is a sad relationship, but we see why she would believe this and why she would feel trapped.Jeremy Sisto (HBO's ""Six Feet Under"", TV's ""Kidnapped"") plays Earl, Jenna's needy, controlling husband. Constantly in need of assurance, reassurance and encouragement, he doesn't want Jenna to do anything that would take her out of his control for long. She receives phone calls at work from her husband in which he needs to hear how much she loves him. When they are together, he threatens to force her to stay at home and quit her job. When he wants to have sex, they have sex, or he threatens to pull some of her liberties. When they are in bed, he forces her to reassure him, tell him how great he is, to make him feel like a man.Sisto dos a very good job of making the viewer loathe this `man', but he also reveals the insecurities Earl has. All of these activities are designed to make Earl feel better about him, but they only reveal what a whimpering sop he truly is. Behind every smile, he has a threat ready. As soon as he threatens Jenna, he tries to smile and get back in her good graces, forcing himself into her good graces.Andy Griffith plays Old Joe, the owner of a number of businesses in the small town. At his age, he can afford to be exacting and if his requests aren't meant, he wants something redone. The role is a nice turn for Griffith, but it often veers dangerously close to the stereotype of the wise old sage. Joe is the type of guy who is always willing to offer a piece of thinly disguised advice in a sage remark. Griffith manages to keep the role from becoming cloying by also being a bit ornery and exacting.The rest of the cast doesn't fare as well. Cheryl Hines' portrayal of Becky takes it little beyond Flo in the old ""Alice"" television series. I half expected her to say ""Kiss my grits"" at least once. She is having an affair with a guy, but won't reveal the details to her two friends, playing coy and flirty. It is a very broad role and the character has few subtle nuances. Adrienne Shelly's Dawn is also a little broad and a bit too `country-fied'. Apparently, she has dating trouble, so she announces she is going on a five-minute blind date. The guy she goes out with likes to make `spontaneous poetry', stringing together a series of nonsensical statements and filling in the blanks with `da da da dadada da'. This is, apparently, endearing to Becky, because they are soon dating hot and heavy.""Waitress"" is not going to surprise many. The story is sweet and good-natured but pretty formulaic.  Some of the moments that will happen towards the end of the story are pretty easy to spot and will seem expected.But the film is saved by the performance of Keri Russell and her musings on the state of her life. As she thinks about a new problem in her life, we see a pie shell in the middle of the screen and a bunch of different ingredients are plopped in as Jenna draws parallels between the ingredients and her life. When she learns she is pregnant, she comes up with the ""Bad Baby"" pie. Her relationship with Earl warrants the ""I Hate My Husband Pie"". All of these creations end up on the menu and appear as though they could be delicious. These pies also help illicit a few humorous moments when people ask for them by name moments after Jenna has created them.At the center of ""Waitress"" is an interesting, believable and engaging character that is surrounded by an increasingly broad series of supporting characters that really detract from the focus and believability of the film as a whole.",3,Keri Russell's Pies Are

It's about a depressed, discontended waitress named Jenna(Keri Russell) dealing with her daily mundane job at pie shop and her abusive husband, and how she faces new challenges and a romance with a married doctor when she unintentionally became pregnant. Jenna is very unhappy woman and a very good baker. She plans to secretly save up enough money and enter a national pie baking contest and run away from her nasty husband. Her two coworkers at the pie shop are good friends and supportive to her, and they also have their share of unhappy romanctic encounters. Jenna's life becomes more chaotic when she has an affair with the local doctor whom she thought might actually be an ideal future husband material, but nothing is what it it seems sometimes. Jenna befriends her regular customer Old Joe(Andy Griffith) who is also the shop owner, and eventually this wise old man becomes her advisor when things get ugly at home with her husband. Will Jenna stay home after giving birth to the baby, and continue to be miserable? Or will she run away with the doctor and start a new life? Or does she have other options....?This is a very charming film and the characters have plenty of funny moments to work with. It's highly entertaining and I was very taken by Keri Russel's performances. The supporting cast all turned in strong performances. I thought the Adrianne Shelly who played the fellow waitress and her funny boyfriend had the funniest moment in the movie. The ending was kind of predictable but I also thought it had built up for the audiences to expect to see a second ending which I won't reveal.",4,"""Start Fresh, Jenna.""",1179532800,"05 19, 2007",2007,1687,"['Waitress', 'surprisingly', 'funny', 'charming', 'delicious', 'even', 'moving', 'times', 'depressed', 'discontended', 'waitress', 'named', 'Jenna', 'Keri', 'Russell', 'dealing', 'daily', 'mundane', 'job', 'pie', 'shop', 'abusive', 'husband', 'how', 'new', 'challenges', 'romance', 'married', 'doctor', 'when', 'unintentionally', 'became', 'pregnant', 'Jenna', 'very', 'unhappy', 'woman', 'very', 'good', 'baker', 'secretly', 'save', 'up', 'enough', 'money', 'enter', 'national', 'pie', 'baking', 'contest', 'run', 'away', 'nasty', 'husband', 'two', 'coworkers', 'pie', 'shop', 'are', 'good', 'friends', 'supportive', 'also', 'have', 'share', 'unhappy', 'romanctic', 'encounters', 'Jenna', 'life', 'more', 'chaotic', 'when', 'affair', 'local', 'doctor', 'whom', 'thought', 'might', 'actually', 'be', 'ideal', 'future', 'husband', 'material', 'nothing', 'what', 'sometimes', 'Jenna', 'regular', 'customer', 'Old', 'Joe', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'who', 'also', 'shop', 'owner', 'eventually', 'wise', 'old', 'man', 'advisor', 'when', 'things', 'get', 'ugly', 'home', 'husband', 'Will', 'Jenna', 'stay', 'home', 'giving', 'birth', 'baby', 'continue', 'be', 'miserable', 'will', 'run', 'away', 'doctor', 'start', 'new', 'life', 'have', 'other', 'options', 'very', 'charming', 'film', 'characters', 'have', 'plenty', 'funny', 'moments', 'work', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'was', 'very', 'taken', 'Keri', 'Russel', 'performances', 'supporting', 'cast', 'turned', 'strong', 'performances', 'thought', 'Adrianne', 'Shelly', 'who', 'played', 'fellow', 'waitress', 'funny', 'boyfriend', 'had', 'funniest', 'moment', 'movie', 'ending', 'was', 'kind', 'predictable', 'also', 'thought', 'had', 'built', 'up', 'audiences', 'expect', 'see', 'second', 'ending', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal']",N/A
