970879,A2ORZYOH2IRT9W,B000E991MK,Jason Dodge,"[11, 25]","In 1993 CBS aired a highly sensationalized special entitled ""The Incredible Discovery of Noah's Ark,"", which contained a long section devoted to the claims of George Jammal, who showed what he called ""sacred wood from the ark"". Jammal's story of a dramatic mountain expedition which allegedly took the life of ""his Polish friend Vladimir"" was actually a deliberate hoax. Jammal, who was really a professional actor, later revealed that his ""sacred wood"" was wood taken from railroad tracks in Long Beach, California, and hardened by cooking with various sauces and baked it in an oven to make it hard and appear to be old. Jammal really wanted to expose the company producing the programe (Sun International) but then they threatened to sue and send the FBI after him. After the program aired, he eventully spoke out, and you can find his full confession on the Internet.This program was manufactured to be a hoax from the beginning (the production company knew the real truth), and over 40 million veiwers watched the documentary. In Skeptic magazine (Spring 1994), Jim Lippard wrote an investigative report, revealing several dozen lies and misleading propaganda tricks which David Balsiger (Executive Producer at Sun International, and he wrote a couple books on the subject) had written into the Noah's Ark program. You probably remember a show were a guy said that said he had ""wood from the Ark"" but you never really remember hearing a definitive answer. So yes, the special was a lie, and now you know. And knowing is half the battle.",1,Has Been Proven To Be A Hoax ----- So Be Warned,1154563200,"08 3, 2006",2006,1541,"['1993', 'CBS', 'aired', 'highly', 'sensationalized', 'special', 'entitled', 'Incredible', 'Discovery', 'Noah', 'Ark', 'contained', 'long', 'section', 'devoted', 'claims', 'George', 'Jammal', 'who', 'showed', 'what', 'called', 'sacred', 'wood', 'ark', 'Jammal', 'story', 'dramatic', 'mountain', 'expedition', 'allegedly', 'took', 'life', 'Polish', 'friend', 'Vladimir', 'was', 'actually', 'deliberate', 'hoax', 'Jammal', 'who', 'was', 'really', 'professional', 'actor', 'later', 'revealed', 'sacred', 'wood', 'was', 'wood', 'taken', 'railroad', 'tracks', 'Long', 'Beach', 'California', 'hardened', 'cooking', 'various', 'sauces', 'baked', 'oven', 'make', 'hard', 'appear', 'be', 'old', 'Jammal', 'really', 'wanted', 'expose', 'company', 'producing', 'programe', 'Sun', 'International', 'then', 'threatened', 'sue', 'send', 'FBI', 'program', 'aired', 'eventully', 'spoke', 'out', 'can', 'find', 'full', 'confession', 'Internet.This', 'program', 'was', 'manufactured', 'be', 'hoax', 'beginning', 'production', 'company', 'knew', 'real', 'truth', '40', 'million', 'veiwers', 'watched', 'documentary', 'Skeptic', 'magazine', 'Spring', '1994', 'Jim', 'Lippard', 'wrote', 'investigative', 'report', 'revealing', 'several', 'dozen', 'lies', 'misleading', 'propaganda', 'tricks', 'David', 'Balsiger', 'Executive', 'Producer', 'Sun', 'International', 'wrote', 'couple', 'books', 'subject', 'had', 'written', 'Noah', 'Ark', 'program', 'probably', 'remember', 'show', 'were', 'guy', 'said', 'said', 'had', 'wood', 'Ark', 'never', 'really', 'remember', 'hearing', 'definitive', 'answer', 'So', 'yes', 'special', 'was', 'lie', 'now', 'know', 'knowing', 'battle']",N/A

The DVD is a search and exploration of the evidences that the large barge located on the Mountains of Ararat is probably the Ark of the Biblical Noah.  It is a wonderful DVD and very well done.  It reviews the history, interviews people who have climbed up and seen the boat, and explores questions generated by the findings and skeptics.

People love mystery and hope is always present. I think this DVD is actually more interesting from that perspective and there are some ideas for how a worldwide flood could have occurred. Fossils are shown and if you enjoy reading biblical accounts, a story is played out to give you a sense of how long it would have actually taken to build such a large vessel. Tests are employed to see if such a vessel would sink under extreme conditions and the problems of how the animals could have been cared for is also addressed.  Many different people, from archeologists to those who claim first-hand knowledge and sightings are interviewed.
