10971,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,0767811429,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[5, 24]","The Governess was, by far, a very pitiful film.  I do not use this word loosely, as it honestly was a poor excuse for a movie.  I finished watching this feature with only one word on my mind ... ""why""?  Honestly, you could use this question at the end of every scene of this film and it would seem like it fit.  There were so many inconsistencies that lead to a lack of development (both in the story and in the characters) which ultimately lead to a very confusing film with actors walking through the motions instead of giving any explanation.  Scenes would occur with no foreshadowing, understanding, or drive to a complete ending.  It was as if I was watching several different ideas thrown together without really any resolution.  Actors were setting events in motion that did not seem to fit their character or really were resolved.  This was my biggest issue with this film.  The complete and utter lack of structure to this film brought all specks of foundation crumbling down with a genuine ""ripple-effect"" being felt throughout the rest of the film as a result.Let me explain myself further on this lack of consistency throughout the film.  I would liken this film to a bowl of lumpy oatmeal that had a zebra in it.  It made no sense nor was there any logic behind it all.  Minnie Driver was the worst culprit of this deed.  Her character's lines were drawn very fuzzy and nearly transparent.  She would do things like talk about sex all the time with her sister, but yet she seemed very open to sexual experiences all the time.  She has her first moment of passion in this film, and there is no pain or excitement.  It nonchalantly happens, and this just didn't seem to fit the original conversation that we had at the beginning of the film with Rosina and her sister.  She is a very intelligent woman that accidentally finds a solution to Wilkinson's problem and suddenly wants full rights to his invention?  That was confusing and completely random.  Is it not obvious to anyone else that her teaching methods were non-existent.  Anyone in their right mind could see that she wasn't teaching Cavendish's daughter anything.  The sudden and awkward relationship that randomly forms between Driver and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers nearly had me laughing out loud.  I thought maybe I had discovered some magic in this film as Rhys-Meyers literally ""poofed"" into the scene and suddenly caused some unneeded drama.  It felt that the director (or writer) was thinking that the original story was going nowhere fast, so by adding this random character we may be able to advance the plot a bit (or confuse the lesser film enthusiasts).  Well, it didn't fool me, I saw that he was nearly a ""cut-and-paste"" character used to strengthen an already weakened story.  Don't get me started on the ending, which had no consistency to the rest of the story.  Again using the ""cut-and-paste"" method, the writer of this film needed a way to just end the story, and this was the only solution they could arrive to.  It is sad when actors are forced to do things out of character ... but I guess that is the name of the game in Hollywood.  Fix until completely broken, or at least salvageable.The remainder of the story was unexciting dribble.  There were maybe a handful of neat cinematography moments where you could see that there was one sliver of creativity trying to peak through coupled with some bars of decent, period piece music, but nothing to write to Grandma about.  More family structure with some stronger introductions could have strengthened this film a bit more, but as I stated before, by leaving open-ended scenes just lying around the entire film, you will experience a crack in your foundation.  What may seem like a sturdy story, will eventually wear down over time, and by the end of this film I felt that the house was crumbling down on top of me.  Wilkinson plays his normal self in this film, while Driver apparently did not want to get naked, but everyone else had too (I will have to see a doctor after those images were burned into my eyes ... eeewwww).  Also, she wore the same dress everyday.  That was disgusting and I could smell her through the television.  Sex and dirty laundry.  Now there is a great film for you!  There just seemed to be some potential floating around here, but instead it was just rubbish.  Nothing was answered, questions seemed to fall like snow in Alaska, and mediocrity seemed to reign supreme.Overall, this could have been a decent film that combined the powerful themes of science and love together, but instead it was just pitiful.  I cannot stress enough the disturbing fact that characters were going through motions without any sort of pre-explanation.  I don't need cinematic moments handed to me like a child, but something should have been done to build a foundation.  Just remember the oatmeal with a zebra analogy that I used.  If you were as confused about that as I was, then you will completely understand the film The Governess, while if you prefer zebras in your oatmeal ... then, maybe this film is for you!Grade: * out of

10973,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,0767811429,C. B Collins Jr.,"[0, 0]","There is much that can be said about this film. It is one of those films that can stimulate much discussion since everyone probably comes away from the film with a vast range of opinions and impressions about what they have seen. The film is told from a Jewish perspective which makes it unique for a film about the English and Scottish in the early 19th century at the frontier days of photography.Minnie Driver is never more beautiful or in full control of her acting abilities as she is in this film. The still photography of her nude is beautiful. This is the film that defines her as an actress. She demonstrates that she can carry an entire production, appearing in almost every scene, and yet always engaging the audience with her well delivered performance.The artistic direction and costumes are super, with a tendency to favor the color black in interiors, carriages, clothing, and furniture. The films inside a Jewish home begin the film.The film has a menacing, foreboding, uneasy feel about it. This in enhanced by the barren shores on the Isle of Skye, the bleak and drafty laboratory of Charles Cavendish, and the almost creepy manner in which the entire Cavendish family interacts. Mrs. Cavendish is spooky. Minnie plays a very young extremely romantic and impressionable Jewish woman who tries to pass as an Italian protestant to obtain a governess position for a wealthy Scottish family. Minnie plays Rosina de Silva who must change her name to Mary Blackchurch to hide her ethnicity. Her student is the young Cavendish daughter, played well by Florence Hoath. Hoath plays this dreadfully morbid child perfectly and offers some of the light moments of humor in the film. Yet even this child makes up puppet plays about murder and exposure to the elements, or reads bloody dreadful fairy stories. While Rosina falls for Mr. Cavendish, his college freshman son falls for Rosina. Henry Cavendish is played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers, who does an excellent job of playing the willful lustful reckless young love puppy, who oddly mirrors Rosina's lust for his father through his obsession with her.Rosina is full of passion and this becomes directed toward Mr. Cavendish, a man 20 years her senior. They become lovers, he wracked with misgivings and guilt, she intoxicated by passion and blind to consequences. It is Charles Cavendish's uneasy approach to the affair that gives the film its narrative tone. He keeps saying that they are making a mistake and the film continually conveys this message with each frame. He moves toward Rosina and then away, his wisdom telling him to be very careful with his emotions.Is there subtext in this film? Yes, I think so. To some degree the film can be seen as what happens when a young overly romantic attractive young women is placed in a situation where her natural passions are easily misdirected to an older married man. Yet there is also a subtext that painful things happen to Jewish folks who become romantically involved with Gentile folks. The film is unique in that it is told through Jewish perspectives rather than the typical Anglo-centric productions, of which there are many. This perspective is interesting and unique.",4,Romantics always wake up in the end.,1191628800,"10 6, 2007",2007,3186,"['much', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'film', 'one', 'films', 'can', 'stimulate', 'much', 'discussion', 'everyone', 'probably', 'away', 'film', 'vast', 'range', 'opinions', 'impressions', 'what', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'told', 'Jewish', 'perspective', 'unique', 'film', 'English', 'Scottish', 'early', '19th', 'century', 'frontier', 'days', 'photography.Minnie', 'Driver', 'never', 'more', 'beautiful', 'full', 'control', 'acting', 'abilities', 'film', 'still', 'photography', 'nude', 'beautiful', 'film', 'actress', 'can', 'carry', 'entire', 'production', 'appearing', 'almost', 'scene', 'yet', 'always', 'engaging', 'audience', 'well', 'delivered', 'artistic', 'direction', 'costumes', 'are', 'super', 'tendency', 'favor', 'color', 'black', 'interiors', 'carriages', 'clothing', 'furniture', 'films', 'Jewish', 'home', 'begin', 'film.The', 'film', 'menacing', 'foreboding', 'uneasy', 'feel', 'enhanced', 'barren', 'Isle', 'Skye', 'bleak', 'drafty', 'laboratory', 'Charles', 'Cavendish', 'almost', 'creepy', 'manner', 'entire', 'Cavendish', 'family', 'interacts', 'Mrs.', 'Cavendish', 'spooky', 'Minnie', 'very', 'young', 'extremely', 'romantic', 'impressionable', 'Jewish', 'woman', 'who', 'pass', 'Italian', 'protestant', 'obtain', 'governess', 'position', 'wealthy', 'Scottish', 'family', 'Minnie', 'Rosina', 'de', 'Silva', 'who', 'must', 'change', 'name', 'Mary', 'Blackchurch', 'hide', 'ethnicity', 'student', 'young', 'Cavendish', 'daughter', 'played', 'well', 'Florence', 'Hoath', 'Hoath', 'dreadfully', 'morbid', 'child', 'perfectly', 'light', 'moments', 'humor', 'film', 'even', 'child', 'up', 'puppet', 'plays', 'murder', 'exposure', 'elements', 'bloody', 'dreadful', 'fairy', 'stories', 'Rosina', 'Mr.', 'Cavendish', 'college', 'freshman', 'son', 'Rosina', 'Henry', 'Cavendish', 'played', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'who', 'excellent', 'job', 'playing', 'willful', 'lustful', 'reckless', 'young', 'love', 'puppy', 'who', 'oddly', 'mirrors', 'Rosina', 'lust', 'father', 'obsession', 'her.Rosina', 'full', 'passion', 'directed', 'Mr.', 'Cavendish', 'man', '20', 'years', 'senior', 'become', 'lovers', 'wracked', 'misgivings', 'guilt', 'intoxicated', 'passion', 'blind', 'consequences', 'Charles', 'Cavendish', 'uneasy', 'approach', 'affair', 'film', 'narrative', 'tone', 'saying', 'are', 'making', 'mistake', 'film', 'continually', 'conveys', 'message', 'frame', 'Rosina', 'then', 'away', 'wisdom', 'telling', 'be', 'very', 'careful', 'emotions.Is', 'subtext', 'film', 'Yes', 'think', 'so', 'degree', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'what', 'when', 'young', 'overly', 'romantic', 'attractive', 'young', 'women', 'placed', 'situation', 'where', 'natural', 'passions', 'are', 'easily', 'misdirected', 'older', 'married', 'man', 'also', 'subtext', 'painful', 'things', 'happen', 'Jewish', 'folks', 'who', 'become', 'romantically', 'involved', 'Gentile', 'folks', 'film', 'unique', 'told', 'Jewish', 'perspectives', 'rather', 'typical', 'Anglo-centric', 'productions', 'are', 'many', 'perspective', 'interesting', 'unique']",N/A
10974,A5ZIMUZLC6SUP,0767811429,Christopher Bryan,"[1, 1]","There is much to praise in this story of a Jewish girl who, suddenly impoverished, poses as a Christian in order to get a job as a governess so that she can earn money to support her family: there is a good script, there is good, tight direction, there is fine photography (apropos which, it would be nice if we could have the thing soon in Blu-ray), and there is good, solid work by the entire acting cast.  I have been fascinated to notice the different things that different people appreciate about this film - none of them necessarily inappropriate.  Thus on one level it is a film about power, particularly its use and abuse in relationships.  On another it is about the absurdities of prejudice, especially religious prejudice.  On another it is about the ability of the human spirit to survive and even grow in difficult circumstances, continuing to function even when surrounded by utter dysfunctionality.  Yet essentially it is simply the story of a young woman, the governess.  As such, it must finally stand or fall by her performance.  It stands, magnificently.  Minnie Driver is simply stunning: by turns funny, feisty, tender, sensual, inventive, and passionate, splendidly outrageous when she responds in kind to the prostitutes who tease her as ""Jew girl""; comical when, in response to her mother's exhortation to look less tall, she scuttles away with head ludicrously and ostentatiously bowed; deeply touching when, alone, she celebrates Pesach as best she can, and taking the Beitzah, recalls happier celebrations of the Seder with her family - I have seen few scenes in any movie more simply poignant than this; and magnificent when, having endured patiently her lover's failure to live up to her passion (arguably, a sin of weakness) she finally becomes angry with him when he refuses to give her any credit for her contribution -- indeed, her crucial contribution -- to his scientific work (a sin of strength, and mean-minded).  Driver's facial expressions during this scene of betrayal - in which she has virtually no lines - are alone a lesson for every aspiring actor.  And with how appropriate a demeanor she takes her final, gentle but entirely fitting, revenge!

Ms. Driver carried the full weight of this film with skill, and I daresay that she has never looked more beautiful or ravishing than in this movie.The film deals with her journey, torn between Jew and incertainty with Gentiles, her love for an older, married man, played by Tom Wilkinson (In The Bedroom), and the unwanted affection of the man's son.A large portion of the film deals with Mr. Cavendish's experiments with photography.  When Rosalina first comes to the Cavendish's home, she is told Mr. Cavendish's secret experiments deal with capturing pictures of ghosts, and indeed, he does seem preoccupied with taking pictures of dead things: a shell from the beach, a bird's wing.  He finds beauty in unexpected places, and it is when he finds Rosalina shares the same views that their relationship blossoms, and she becomes his favorite subject to photograph.  The scenes of Rosalina's photo being taken are beautifully shot.  The sensuality of the camera is greatly evident and capitalized upon in the film, and you become aware that even today's cold, calculated video cameras still have a spark of that warmth from their early precedessors.The color in the film is vibrant, as when Rosalina wears a bright red coat or when she returns home, her neighborhood stricken with cholera, and shades of blue fill the screen.THE GOVERNESS is a great period piece, but Minnie Driver's wonderful performance should be reason enough to see it",4,The sensuality of photography....,1021075200,"05 11, 2002",2002,1585,"['GOVERNESS', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'period', 'piece', 'character', 'Rosalina', 'played', 'remarkable', 'depth', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'Ms.', 'Driver', 'carried', 'full', 'weight', 'film', 'skill', 'daresay', 'never', 'looked', 'more', 'beautiful', 'ravishing', 'movie.The', 'film', 'deals', 'journey', 'torn', 'Jew', 'incertainty', 'Gentiles', 'love', 'older', 'married', 'man', 'played', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'Bedroom', 'unwanted', 'affection', 'man', 'son.A', 'large', 'portion', 'film', 'deals', 'Mr.', 'Cavendish', 'experiments', 'photography', 'When', 'Rosalina', 'first', 'Cavendish', 'home', 'told', 'Mr.', 'Cavendish', 'secret', 'experiments', 'deal', 'capturing', 'pictures', 'ghosts', 'indeed', 'seem', 'preoccupied', 'taking', 'pictures', 'dead', 'things', 'shell', 'beach', 'bird', 'wing', 'beauty', 'unexpected', 'places', 'when', 'Rosalina', 'shares', 'same', 'views', 'relationship', 'blossoms', 'favorite', 'subject', 'photograph', 'scenes', 'Rosalina', 'photo', 'being', 'taken', 'are', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'sensuality', 'camera', 'greatly', 'evident', 'capitalized', 'upon', 'film', 'become', 'aware', 'even', 'today', 'cold', 'calculated', 'video', 'cameras', 'still', 'have', 'spark', 'warmth', 'early', 'precedessors.The', 'color', 'film', 'vibrant', 'when', 'Rosalina', 'bright', 'red', 'coat', 'when', 'home', 'neighborhood', 'stricken', 'cholera', 'shades', 'blue', 'fill', 'screen.THE', 'GOVERNESS', 'great', 'period', 'piece', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'should', 'be', 'reason', 'enough', 'see']",N/A
10976,A2P49WD75WHAG5,0767811429,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[7, 8]","This movie, set in the late 1830's or early 1840's, combines the divide between Jews and Gentiles, the struggles women had to have in a patriarchal society, and the search for a permament fixative agent in photography.Rosina is a young Jewish women whose father unexpectedly dies.  This is disaster for women, because their career options were limited to three:  marriage, prostitution, or domestic employment.  Rosina though is quite plucky, and after a meeting with an elderly fishmonger, says she'd rather be a prostitute.  Fortunately, she finds a situation in the paper, much to the distress of her mother, who wants her to carry on the tradition and be married to a Jew.  However, she has to change her name to something more English, change into more acceptable clothing, and for her new adventure, to learn math and the New Testament.Undaunted, Rosina, going by the alias Mary Blackchurch, goes to the Isle of Skye in Scotland and the Cavendishes to become a governess for their daughter Clementina.  The mother is a bit of an insipid and weak-willed woman mostly in bed, whom Rosina/Mary describes as ""speak[ing] like she has a lemon up her posterior.""  The daughter is a little horror at first, but they become friends.  As for Charles Cavendish, he's busy working on research trying to find that elusive fixative process in photography.  Rosina has had lot of learning from her family, and interested, becomes his assistant.  He has some sample photos, but they quickly dissolve after exposure to sunlight.  However, due to a serendipitous accident, Rosina discovers it, much to their delight.  His disinterest in capturing human faces changes when Rosina becomes his subject, and before long, that blossoms into an affair.  Rosina herself finds herself in a privileged position, as both she and Cavendish will become famous after reporting their findings to the Royal Society.  This will thrust her above the ordinary woman, especially considering she's Jewish.  She becomes more confident, more so than any woman.  In short, she considers herself Cavendish's equal, and it's her own turn behind the lens that leads to disaster.The concept of photography was quite revolutionary when formulated by Niepce and his partner Daguerre.  As Rosina observes, photography captures the essence of people.  The fixative agent serves to fix the memory of people.  Nowadays, we take photography for granted, but think of what it meant back then, proof that someone existed, a visual historical document, that also influenced the schools of art.  And only a privileged few could master the technique.  And think what it meant for photographers like Matthew Brady in the Civil War or Jacob Riis in the 1890's.The scene of Cavendish taking his pictures of Mary is revealing, as we see his single eye through the peephole of the camera, which then closes, after which the picture is taken.  While it represents photographer and subject, it also represents the barrier between men and women as well as English and Jew.  On one side of the lens, there are the favoured, men and English, who can see everything.  All Jews and women can see is the eye of the elite looking at them, signifying their powerlessness.  The fact that Mary gets that opportunity shows how lucky and plucky she is with the roles reversed.As Rosina/Mary, Minnie Driver puts a lot into a very complex character.  Initially, the viewer learns how Rosina wants to be on stage.  The rich learning from her family lends to her scientific and rational capacity, but her romantic and idealistic side comes into play once she succeeds and feels she could be anything she wanted.  In contrast, Tom Wilkinson's Cavendish is someone unable to cope with his mind out of control, in the realms of passion, more comfortable with passionless and dry science, objects as opposed to people.  And it's a discomfort that turns to anger.  Arlene Cockburn, who plays Lily the maid, also appeared in The Winter Guest as the tomboyish Nita.An interesting movie that may go a bit long, but boosted by Minnie Driver, who's at her most sensuous here.",4,The fixation of memory and the essence of people,1091577600,"08 4, 2004",2004,4091,"['movie', 'set', 'late', '1830', 'early', '1840', 'divide', 'Jews', 'Gentiles', 'struggles', 'women', 'had', 'have', 'patriarchal', 'society', 'search', 'permament', 'fixative', 'agent', 'photography.Rosina', 'young', 'Jewish', 'women', 'father', 'unexpectedly', 'disaster', 'women', 'career', 'options', 'were', 'limited', 'three', 'marriage', 'prostitution', 'domestic', 'employment', 'Rosina', 'quite', 'plucky', 'meeting', 'elderly', 'fishmonger', ""'d"", 'rather', 'be', 'prostitute', 'Fortunately', 'situation', 'paper', 'much', 'distress', 'mother', 'who', 'carry', 'tradition', 'be', 'married', 'Jew', 'However', 'change', 'name', 'something', 'more', 'English', 'change', 'more', 'acceptable', 'clothing', 'new', 'adventure', 'learn', 'math', 'New', 'Testament.Undaunted', 'Rosina', 'going', 'alias', 'Mary', 'Blackchurch', 'Isle', 'Skye', 'Scotland', 'Cavendishes', 'become', 'governess', 'daughter', 'Clementina', 'mother', 'bit', 'insipid', 'weak-willed', 'woman', 'mostly', 'bed', 'whom', 'Rosina/Mary', 'speak', '[', 'ing', ']', 'lemon', 'up', 'posterior', 'daughter', 'little', 'horror', 'first', 'become', 'friends', 'Charles', 'Cavendish', 'busy', 'working', 'research', 'trying', 'find', 'elusive', 'fixative', 'process', 'photography', 'Rosina', 'had', 'lot', 'learning', 'family', 'interested', 'assistant', 'sample', 'photos', 'quickly', 'dissolve', 'exposure', 'sunlight', 'However', 'due', 'serendipitous', 'accident', 'Rosina', 'much', 'delight', 'disinterest', 'capturing', 'human', 'changes', 'when', 'Rosina', 'subject', 'long', 'affair', 'Rosina', 'privileged', 'position', 'Cavendish', 'will', 'become', 'famous', 'reporting', 'findings', 'Royal', 'Society', 'will', 'thrust', 'ordinary', 'woman', 'especially', 'considering', 'Jewish', 'more', 'confident', 'more', 'so', 'woman', 'short', 'Cavendish', 'equal', 'own', 'turn', 'lens', 'disaster.The', 'concept', 'photography', 'was', 'quite', 'revolutionary', 'when', 'formulated', 'Niepce', 'partner', 'Daguerre', 'Rosina', 'photography', 'essence', 'people', 'fixative', 'agent', 'serves', 'fix', 'memory', 'people', 'Nowadays', 'take', 'photography', 'granted', 'think', 'what', 'meant', 'back', 'then', 'proof', 'someone', 'existed', 'visual', 'historical', 'document', 'also', 'influenced', 'schools', 'art', 'only', 'privileged', 'few', 'could', 'master', 'technique', 'think', 'what', 'meant', 'photographers', 'Matthew', 'Brady', 'Civil', 'War', 'Jacob', 'Riis', ""1890's.The"", 'scene', 'Cavendish', 'taking', 'pictures', 'Mary', 'revealing', 'see', 'single', 'eye', 'peephole', 'camera', 'then', 'picture', 'taken', 'photographer', 'subject', 'also', 'barrier', 'men', 'women', 'as', 'well', 'English', 'Jew', 'one', 'side', 'lens', 'are', 'favoured', 'men', 'English', 'who', 'can', 'see', 'everything', 'Jews', 'women', 'can', 'see', 'eye', 'elite', 'looking', 'signifying', 'powerlessness', 'fact', 'Mary', 'opportunity', 'how', 'lucky', 'plucky', 'roles', 'reversed.As', 'Rosina/Mary', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'lot', 'very', 'complex', 'character', 'Initially', 'viewer', 'how', 'Rosina', 'be', 'stage', 'rich', 'learning', 'family', 'scientific', 'rational', 'capacity', 'romantic', 'idealistic', 'side', 'play', 'once', 'feels', 'could', 'be', 'anything', 'wanted', 'contrast', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'Cavendish', 'someone', 'unable', 'cope', 'mind', 'control', 'realms', 'passion', 'more', 'comfortable', 'passionless', 'dry', 'science', 'as', 'opposed', 'people', 'discomfort', 'anger', 'Arlene', 'Cockburn', 'who', 'Lily', 'maid', 'also', 'appeared', 'Winter', 'Guest', 'tomboyish', 'Nita.An', 'interesting', 'movie', 'may', 'go', 'bit', 'long', 'boosted', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'who', 'most', 'sensuous', 'here']",N/A

10985,AWK4E3IB6SWEE,0767811429,"Karusichan ""Karusichan""","[13, 14]","I am a period movie fan. I first saw this film when it was new in the rental stores. At the time I thought it was interesting, but it did not rate as high as other films I was into. Recently I decided to watch it again while I was fiending for a movie with Jonathan Rhys-Meyers in it and I must say it was worth a second viewing.Minnie Driver plays Rosina, a young Jewish woman who must find employment to help support her family after the murder of her father. She gets hired at a home in Scotland by cold woman with two children and a husband who spends the bulk of his time pursuing new innovations in the Photographic field. Quickly she is swept up in the morose nature of this family, but she finds joy in the studio with the lord of the manor and an unexpected love affair as well.The casting of this movie was well done. Driver's performance as the ingenue suits her well and she captivates as the driving force behind the plot. Tom Wilkinson, who plays her love interest Charles Cavendish, is also well matched as the isolated naturalist who cannot bring himself to face the timultuous emotions the young Rosina inspires in him. As for the reason I chose to rewatch the film, Meyers is as engaging as always as the young college man who fixates his desire on Rosina nearly from the moment he meets her. The cinematography is also stunning, the gray and black tones of color set the mood of the film and the location is a fitting backdrop for this brooding story, whether or not it is actually Scotland I am not sure, but it comes off well none the less. And the scenes where Cavendish is shooting pictures of Rosina are simply wonderful.My only real complaint about the film was that it lacked a bit of subtance when it came to the family. I would have liked to have more explanation about why the family was so dysfunctional. The mother spends all of her time obsessing about London society, though she has never been there before. Charles Cavendish obsesses over his work and not much else, although he manages his to air bigotry and male chauvinism often enough. The daughter, Clementina, only cares about drawing attention to herself and does so by showing off her dead animals and telling her disturbing dreams to anyone who might listen, and Henry Cavendish spends most of his time chasing after Rosina and engaging in generally creepy behavior because he was drawn to her differences and because he liked to shock his family, as demonstrated by his expulsion from school due to being found in an opium den. What draws a family to act like this? I don't know, because it was never hashed out anywhere in the film, and I like to think that Scotland is probably not as dreary as this film portrays it, certainly not dreary enough to lead people to behave like this.Overall, not a bad film though.

Is everyone really so shallow that love can only occur between the very young or the very attractive? Is it not possible to love someone for creativity, intellect or talent?  The Governess was an extraordinary, breath taking period piece. Rosina (Mary Blackchurch) becomes interested in her employer's experiments with photography fixation and subsequently falls in love (while pursued by the employer's son). Rosina's first experience with love is tumultuous and passionate.  The secrets surrounding her religion helps to add conflict to the already doomed relationship. Rosina's employer, played brilliantly by Tom Wilkinson, shared her passion but was unable to embrace the new emotions awakened within. The reclusive Charles Cavendish, like his castle, was at times dim and hollow. Unsuccessfully, Rosina (Minnie Driver) tries to bring life to an otherwise cold and lifeless environment. Some viewers have wondered why the Rosina character would fall for the father, when the allegedly more attractive son (Henry) was so obviously smitten. Considering the immature and bizarre behavior of Henry Cavendish (played by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), should anyone wonder at all? The senior Cavendish despite his shortcomings possessed a mysteriously masculine allure that would charm any young woman looking for both a lover and a father figure. It is also important for viewers to remember that this film is set in Scotland, during the 1800's....  Unfortunately, in this story the viewer will witness that love (alone) is not always enough to sustain a relationship.  In the end, Rosina shows a strength and bravery that most modern folk's lack.

A good Jane Austen setup, right?  It only goes downhill from here.Rosina thereafter seeks a position with a wealthy English family, the Cavendishes.  However, to do so she must hide the fact that she is Jewish (this is the late 1800s, and prejudice against Jews is rampant).  She therefore changes her name to Mary Blackchurch and goes to live with the Cavendishes as the governess to their daughter Clementina.Rosina continues to practice some Jewish rituals (we see her, for instance, saying the blessing over a candle on Shabbat and trying to have her own Passover seder), and it's just a matter of time until she's found out--which, predictably enough, she is, by Cavendish son Henry, who has fallen in love with her.But that's not enough plot, so director Sandra Goldbacher has Rosina fall in love with Mr. Cavendish (Tom Wilkinson of ""The Full MOnty""), who is attempting to become a pioneer in the new field of photography.  Rosina begins to help Mr. Cavendish with his project, and the two begin an affair despite the fact that there is absolutely NO chemistry between them.The best moments in the movie involve little-seen characters Henry (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) and Mrs. Cavendish (Harriet Walter, the evil sister-in-law Fanny in ""Sense and Sensibility"").  Driver is woefully miscast, mispronouncing Hebrew words every time she tries to do so and striking no sparks with Wilkinson.

Rosina is headstrong, and rejects a marriage proposal from an  older, boring man. She would rather be an actress.

10989,A2NJO6YE954DBH,0767811429,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 5]","I have to admit I have a hard time wrapping my mind around the idea of Minnie Driver playing a young Jewish girl in 19th century England who passes herself off as a Christian to obtain a position as a governess to a family on the Isle of Skye in Scotland.  She just sounds too ""modern"" to me for any character she plays to really feel at home for me in a period costume drama.  That being said, Driver's performance in ""The Governess"" is nonetheless compelling and one of the more erotic that I have seen recently, and that surprising development is what you will remember more from this film than anything else.Driver is Rosina da Silva, the eldest daughter of a well-to-do family in the Sephardic Jewish community in London.  Instead of dreaming of being married, Rosie longs to be an actress, inspired by her aunt, who sings on the stage.  But then her father is murdered and the family is faced with a mountain of debts.  Faced with the prospect of being married to a rich older man, Rosie places an advertisement in the papers claiming to be a proper young Christian woman, named Mary Blackchurch, looking for suitable employment as a governess.  So she finds herself being transported to the wilds of Scotland, where the green seems to go on forever, pretending to be a Gentile gentlewoman.""Mary"" is employed by the Cavandishes to take care of their young daughter Clementina (Florence Hoath), who has to be threatened into obedience before a bond can form between them.  Mrs. Cavendish (Harriet Walter) has a lemon where no one should have a lemon and dreams of the pleasures of London; the only problem is that she has never been there.  Mr. Cavendish (Tom Wilkinson) spends all of his time working in his laboratory on something he thinks is too complicated by the delicate minds of women.  But whereas his wife is clearly beyond understanding anything from the realm of science, the new governess shows not only understanding but interest and aptitude.  There's is a meeting of the minds and then other parts of the body get involved as well.A complication to their private idles is Clementina's older brother, Henry (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), who becomes infatuated by the young governess and never thinks that his own father is a rival for her affections.  However, ""Mary"" wants a man and not a boy and while he would rather photograph his specimens she convinces him to photograph her as well.  Thinking of the ancient Hebrews who made love while covered, she drapes a diaphanous cloth over herself in what becomes the basis for a series of subtly erotic photographs.  Eventually, she will take some photographs of him as well.  More importantly, she will help him solve the problem of fixing an image so that they do not fade.Photography is a key part of this story and the gulf that divides the two lovers is defined more by their diametrically opposed approaches to the camera than by the differences in their genders and religion.  He sees photography as simply a tool to help him make a scientific record of reality, while she takes the artistic view that it is an opportunity ""to capture the essence of people and to fix a memory.""  Ultimately the meeting of the minds and bodies proves too much for Cavendish, who fears her superior intellect even more than he is shamed by her passionate nature.  Rosie will not find happiness here, but she will learn what happiness will mean for her in the rest of her life.Written and Directed by Sandra Goldbacher this 1998 film does make Rosie's Jewishness a key part of her character.  Because he mother is Italian she has a convenient excuse for her olive complexion and can honestly say that she is not Catholic.  She continues to practice her faith in private, although the Cavendishes are patently incapable of recognizing any of the trappings of her faith.  Of course, if Cavendish knew that his lover was a Jewess he would no doubt be repulsed.  But he is captivated by her eroticism, which Driver creates for Rosie.  The great lesson here is being erotic is not how you look, but rather how you act, and in ""The Governess"" Minnie Driver proves she knows how to act.",4,Minnie Driver provides a captivating and erotic performance,1097107200,"10 7, 2004",2004,4129,"['have', 'admit', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'wrapping', 'mind', 'idea', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'playing', 'young', 'Jewish', 'girl', '19th', 'century', 'England', 'who', 'off', 'Christian', 'obtain', 'position', 'governess', 'family', 'Isle', 'Skye', 'Scotland', 'just', 'too', 'modern', 'character', 'really', 'feel', 'home', 'period', 'costume', 'drama', 'being', 'said', 'Driver', 'performance', 'Governess', 'nonetheless', 'compelling', 'one', 'more', 'erotic', 'have', 'seen', 'recently', 'surprising', 'development', 'what', 'will', 'remember', 'more', 'film', 'anything', 'else.Driver', 'Rosina', 'da', 'Silva', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'well-to-do', 'family', 'Sephardic', 'Jewish', 'community', 'London', 'Instead', 'dreaming', 'being', 'married', 'Rosie', 'be', 'actress', 'inspired', 'aunt', 'who', 'stage', 'then', 'father', 'murdered', 'family', 'faced', 'mountain', 'debts', 'Faced', 'prospect', 'being', 'married', 'rich', 'older', 'man', 'Rosie', 'advertisement', 'papers', 'claiming', 'be', 'proper', 'young', 'Christian', 'woman', 'named', 'Mary', 'Blackchurch', 'looking', 'suitable', 'employment', 'governess', 'being', 'transported', 'wilds', 'Scotland', 'where', 'green', 'go', 'forever', 'pretending', 'be', 'Gentile', 'gentlewoman', 'Mary', 'employed', 'Cavandishes', 'take', 'care', 'young', 'daughter', 'Clementina', 'Florence', 'Hoath', 'who', 'be', 'threatened', 'obedience', 'bond', 'can', 'form', 'Mrs.', 'Cavendish', 'Harriet', 'Walter', 'lemon', 'where', 'one', 'should', 'have', 'lemon', 'dreams', 'pleasures', 'London', 'only', 'problem', 'never', 'been', 'there', 'Mr.', 'Cavendish', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'time', 'working', 'laboratory', 'something', 'too', 'complicated', 'delicate', 'minds', 'women', 'wife', 'clearly', 'understanding', 'anything', 'realm', 'science', 'new', 'governess', 'not', 'only', 'understanding', 'interest', 'aptitude', 'meeting', 'minds', 'then', 'other', 'parts', 'body', 'get', 'involved', 'well.A', 'complication', 'private', 'idles', 'Clementina', 'older', 'brother', 'Henry', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys-Meyers', 'who', 'infatuated', 'young', 'governess', 'never', 'own', 'father', 'rival', 'affections', 'However', 'Mary', 'man', 'not', 'boy', 'would', 'rather', 'photograph', 'specimens', 'photograph', 'as', 'well', 'Thinking', 'ancient', 'Hebrews', 'who', 'made', 'love', 'covered', 'diaphanous', 'cloth', 'what', 'basis', 'series', 'subtly', 'erotic', 'photographs', 'Eventually', 'will', 'take', 'photographs', 'as', 'well', 'More', 'importantly', 'will', 'help', 'solve', 'problem', 'fixing', 'image', 'so', 'do', 'not', 'fade.Photography', 'key', 'part', 'story', 'gulf', 'two', 'lovers', 'defined', 'more', 'diametrically', 'opposed', 'approaches', 'camera', 'differences', 'genders', 'religion', 'photography', 'simply', 'tool', 'help', 'make', 'scientific', 'record', 'reality', 'artistic', 'view', 'opportunity', 'capture', 'essence', 'people', 'fix', 'memory', 'Ultimately', 'meeting', 'minds', 'bodies', 'too', 'much', 'Cavendish', 'who', 'superior', 'intellect', 'even', 'more', 'shamed', 'passionate', 'nature', 'Rosie', 'will', 'not', 'find', 'happiness', 'here', 'will', 'learn', 'what', 'happiness', 'will', 'mean', 'rest', 'life.Written', 'Directed', 'Sandra', 'Goldbacher', '1998', 'film', 'make', 'Rosie', 'Jewishness', 'key', 'part', 'character', 'Italian', 'convenient', 'excuse', 'olive', 'complexion', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'not', 'Catholic', 'practice', 'faith', 'private', 'Cavendishes', 'are', 'patently', 'incapable', 'recognizing', 'trappings', 'faith', 'course', 'Cavendish', 'knew', 'lover', 'was', 'Jewess', 'would', 'doubt', 'be', 'repulsed', 'captivated', 'eroticism', 'Driver', 'Rosie', 'great', 'lesson', 'here', 'being', 'erotic', 'not', 'how', 'look', 'rather', 'how', 'act', 'Governess', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'how', 'act']",N/A

This one is a little unusual in that the storyline revolves around a Sephardic Jewess, Rosalina Da Silva, who lives in London with her family. When her father dies most unexpectedly, the family suffers a reversal of fortune, and Rosalina must either marry or work in order to be able to assist her family financially. A passionate, intelligent, and earthy woman for her time, Rosalina opts to work, rather than marry the unattractive, older fish merchant who comes a courting.Looking forward to adventure and a change of scenery, she obtains employment as a governess to the Protestant, upper crust Cavendish family on the remote Isle of Skye in Scotland. She obtains the position under the assumed name ""Mary Black-Church"" in order to avoid anti-semitism. Shortly after her arrival, she meets the lady of the house, a vapid, bored, and totally uninteresting woman, as well as her charge, a spoiled young girl, whom ""Mary"" quickly sets to right.The man of the house, Charles Cavendish, is an educated, seemingly middle aged man, introspective and remote, engaged in perfecting the process involved in that of early  photography, a project in which his wife is clearly uninterested. ""Mary"", inquisitive and freed of her familial constraints, becomes interested in his work, much to Mr. Cavendish's surprise and ultimate delight. While he only photographs inanimate objects, ""Mary"" is much more intrigued by the idea of capturing  a living likeness, an interest in which Charles Cavendish neither shares nor comprehends. Initially drawn to ""Mary"" by her seeming interest in his project, a spark ignites between them, and they begin a quite torrid and passionate affair which ""Mary"" overtly invites.The affair comes crashing down when ""Mary"" takes some nude shots of Charles while he is sleeping. Caught in so vulnerable and compromising a position, Charles abruptly ends the affair, much to ""Mary's"" torment and despair. ""Mary"" retaliates in a big way, sending the household rocking, by having an affair with Charles' son, Harry, and, ultimately, by giving the wife her very own  set of photographs of her husband. Never underestimate the fury of a woman scorned!""Mary"" returns to London and her home, resuming her own identity. What she does with her newly acquired skill in photography is sure to delight feminists everywhere. As to what Charles Cavensish eventually does about ""Mary"", watch the movie and see who has the last laugh.Minnie Driver gives a wonderful portrayal as the spirited Rosalina Da Silva, while Tom Wilkinson gives a fine performance as the dour Charles Cavendish, a man caught in a web of his own making. The love scenes between the two, however, at times do not quite work, almost as if there were no chemistry between the two. Perhaps it is because ""Mary"" initiates the affair, and it is somewhat unexpected and jarring to have her do so. Yet, at other times the love scenes are positively sensual and consummately erotic...especially the veil scene.Harriet Walters does justice to her role as the insipid Mrs. Cavendish.

10991,AD2BIAIH78QI5,0767811429,"Linda McDonnell ""TutorGal""","[2, 6]","I was very interested in seeing ""The Governess"" and fairly lept at the opportunity to do so when my friend Marion suggested it. What a disappointment! Haven't been so let down since ""Murder on the Orient Express"" as a child.What's the matter? The major problem is that there's just too much crammed into the movie as plot devices. Why not deal with just a few circumstances, than have all this tumult which in the end, doesn't even signify?Interesting premise in a nutshell description: A 19th century Jewish woman must conceal her religion as she takes up a governess position. That's how it was presented, and frankly, that's enough. No, how about her father gets murdered in the street! Well, that was shocking, but what of it? It never got solved, it never figured in the rest of the movie. I mean, he could have just, you know, died. Why murdered? Then she goes off to the dreariest place in all of Scotland. The master of the house keeps trying to make early photographs. The Governess takes it upon herself to solve his problems developing film by dumping salt in his solutions. Hey what do you know, he evidently gets credited as the inventor of the photograph, when it was really The Governess. Well, what about that? Couldn't that be a good feminist statement in and of itself? No, let's begin a torrid, somewhat unmotivated affair. Then she takes nude photos of him for a change. Uh-oh, that's the limit, too vulnerable a position for a  man. Finally, she's off to London again as a photographer in her own right, and guess who walks into the salon...? Enough already.I just found it more preposterous as it went on. I was more than willing to accept some off-the-beaten-track developments, but this was aimless messing about.

10992,A152C8GYY25HAH,0767811429,Matthew Horner,"[2, 2]","1998 was a very good year for British movies. Awards and nominations were showered on a number of films, including Shakespeare in Love, Elizabeth, Waking Ned Divine, Little Voice and Gods and Monsters. There wasn't room for some of their other efforts to share the spotlight. The Governess, which certainly is as good as some of the honored choices, is one of them.The Governess is decidedly not light fare. It takes place in the England of about 1840, when the class system - and therefore, prejudice - was still in power. Women had few legal rights, and the heroine of this story is Jewish. Jews were not oppressed in England, as they were elsewhere, but the times made it difficult for them to interact socially with Gentiles.In Rosina, writer and director Sandra Goldbacker has fashioned a memorable, complex character, which Minnie Driver plays splendidly. Rosina is free-spirited and bohemian, but also shrew and intelligent. When her father dies suddenly, her family is left in debt. She is well educated for her time, but has no particular job skills. Like most girls then, it had always been presumed she would marry. She comes up with a plan to be a governess, but must pretend not to be Jewish, in order to obtain employment. So, she becomes Mary Blackchurch, and obtains a position on the Isle of Skye, off the coast of Scotland.Her employers are the Cavanishes, an eccentric family, typical of people who live in isolated places. The family soon accepts her, and she discovers that all Christians are not the beasts she feared they would be. Of course, keeping her true identity a secret is still necessary.Charles Cavandish [Tom Wilkinson] is a scientist working on an invention. He works strictly alone, but Mary's natural curiosity drives her to find out what he is doing in his lab. When he finds her out, he is so delighted to find someone interested in his work, he makes her his assistant. This sets the stage for a love affair which is heart-wrenching because it is obviously doomed.I was fascinated by Rosina/Mary and by her love affair. Some have said they felt her character was too 90s. I have seen historical romances where this is true, but I do not think this is one of them. Regardless of what period of history we are looking at, the fact is that there have always been women who were independent, sensual and as smart as the men around them. If this character is too modern, then so is Scarlett O'Hara.The Governess is not a commecial movie. It presumes a knowledge of history that most people simply do not care to have. You have to have some understanding of Jewish life in the early 19th Century. The invention Cavandish is working on has to do with photography. You also have to know that back then, the idea of capturing reality in a picture was a new and startling one. Without such knowledge, the movie will probably be a sleep aid.",4,Intriguing period piece,1017187200,"03 27, 2002",2002,2870,"['1998', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'year', 'British', 'movies', 'Awards', 'nominations', 'were', 'showered', 'number', 'films', 'including', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', 'Elizabeth', 'Waking', 'Ned', 'Divine', 'Little', 'Voice', 'Gods', 'Monsters', 'was', ""n't"", 'room', 'other', 'efforts', 'share', 'spotlight', 'Governess', 'certainly', 'as', 'good', 'honored', 'choices', 'one', 'them.The', 'Governess', 'decidedly', 'not', 'light', 'fare', 'place', 'England', '1840', 'when', 'class', 'system', 'therefore', 'prejudice', 'was', 'still', 'power', 'Women', 'had', 'few', 'legal', 'rights', 'heroine', 'story', 'Jewish', 'Jews', 'were', 'not', 'oppressed', 'England', 'were', 'elsewhere', 'times', 'made', 'difficult', 'interact', 'socially', 'Gentiles.In', 'Rosina', 'writer', 'director', 'Sandra', 'Goldbacker', 'fashioned', 'memorable', 'complex', 'character', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'splendidly', 'Rosina', 'free-spirited', 'bohemian', 'also', 'shrew', 'intelligent', 'When', 'father', 'suddenly', 'family', 'left', 'debt', 'well', 'educated', 'time', 'particular', 'job', 'skills', 'most', 'girls', 'then', 'had', 'always', 'been', 'presumed', 'would', 'marry', 'up', 'plan', 'be', 'governess', 'must', 'pretend', 'not', 'be', 'Jewish', 'order', 'obtain', 'employment', 'So', 'Mary', 'Blackchurch', 'position', 'Isle', 'Skye', 'coast', 'Scotland.Her', 'employers', 'are', 'Cavanishes', 'eccentric', 'family', 'typical', 'people', 'who', 'live', 'isolated', 'places', 'family', 'soon', 'Christians', 'are', 'not', 'beasts', 'feared', 'would', 'be', 'course', 'keeping', 'true', 'identity', 'secret', 'still', 'necessary.Charles', 'Cavandish', '[', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', ']', 'scientist', 'working', 'invention', 'strictly', 'alone', 'Mary', 'natural', 'curiosity', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'doing', 'lab', 'When', 'out', 'so', 'delighted', 'find', 'someone', 'interested', 'work', 'assistant', 'stage', 'love', 'affair', 'heart-wrenching', 'obviously', 'doomed.I', 'was', 'fascinated', 'Rosina/Mary', 'love', 'affair', 'have', 'said', 'felt', 'character', 'was', 'too', '90s', 'have', 'seen', 'historical', 'romances', 'where', 'true', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'one', 'Regardless', 'what', 'period', 'history', 'are', 'looking', 'fact', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'women', 'who', 'were', 'independent', 'sensual', 'as', 'smart', 'men', 'character', 'too', 'modern', 'then', 'so', 'Scarlett', ""O'Hara.The"", 'Governess', 'not', 'commecial', 'movie', 'knowledge', 'history', 'most', 'people', 'simply', 'do', 'not', 'care', 'have', 'have', 'have', 'understanding', 'Jewish', 'life', 'early', '19th', 'Century', 'invention', 'Cavandish', 'working', 'do', 'photography', 'also', 'have', 'know', 'back', 'then', 'idea', 'capturing', 'reality', 'picture', 'was', 'new', 'startling', 'one', 'such', 'knowledge', 'movie', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'sleep', 'aid']",N/A

10999,A31CXEZDNUT3OF,0767811429,The Busy Bee,"[1, 2]","Curiosity got the better of me when I heard this movie was a feminist, Jewish woman in Scotland film - with Jonathan Rhys-Meyers. I watched with an open mind, but was left disappointed and confused with the supposed theme. What the movie lacks, in a word = DEPTH.Minnie Driver's character begins in a whirlwind moment from being an affluent Jewess, to force-employing herself as a fake british Governess to a family in Scotland. The family..... a bored stuffy mother, bratty sociopathic daughter, and melancholy older son (JRM) lend no reasons to be as dysfunctional a family as they are - weakening their purpose in the plot. The only insight into any of them is the introverted, weak,  scientific husband (Tom Wilikinson)... who eventually falls prey to Driver's wiles and exotic creativity.Driver's character, Rosina, is very conflicting.  She is eager to be useful, too easily wanton, and industrious/creative when it comes to the discoveries of ""photography"" in the movie.  For these aspects she is a budding feminist - aware of her body and determined to be acknowledged for her part in the discoveries of science.But on the other hand, she also begs for forgiveness and attention, weeps in tantrums, and the film shows hardly any of her supposed education/teaching (which is the reason she is employed there in the first place). So from this aspect she is a weak female depending on her employer-turned lover.  Her inconsistency is irritating and has no development. Then a dramatic turn - she suddenly becomes the scorned lover, vengeful and reckless of who's family she ruins, embracing her heratige and new-found knowledge... an unexpected strength from her.... again attesting to the character's inconsistency.To make matters worse, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers character is but a blip in the film, solely there to reveal Driver's true identity to his Father and play the overdramatic part of the infatuated young son. His obsession with the Rosina is over the top, considering how little film time it gets. It's like it comes out of nowhere - and when she leaves the family near the end - he is flailing naked in the ocean, curled up in the fetal position weeping in the sandy waves!?!  It was just too much, with little basis. Not to mention that here and in the ""lover"" scenes of the film - male full frontal nudity seems placed solely for attempt at ""dark artsiness.""So -  Rosina becomes an empowered woman, going 'back to her people' with the stolen photo lenses, creating her own photography business. There is no time frame to gauge how quickly her broken family is taken from rags to riches again - but that is attributed to the film's choppy storyline throughout.All in all, the film's characters were cliched when they could have been better fleshed out. The movie lacked depth and attempted at artsy-fartsiness.... but failed in my opinion due to it's inconsistency, rushed timelines and chopiness.",3,Attempt at artsy film lacks depth and consistency,1236556800,"03 9, 2009",2009,2912,"['Curiosity', 'got', 'better', 'when', 'heard', 'movie', 'was', 'feminist', 'Jewish', 'woman', 'Scotland', 'film', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys-Meyers', 'watched', 'open', 'mind', 'was', 'left', 'disappointed', 'confused', 'supposed', 'theme', 'What', 'movie', 'word', '=', 'DEPTH.Minnie', 'Driver', 'character', 'whirlwind', 'moment', 'being', 'affluent', 'Jewess', 'force-employing', 'fake', 'british', 'Governess', 'family', 'Scotland', 'family', 'bored', 'stuffy', 'mother', 'bratty', 'sociopathic', 'daughter', 'melancholy', 'older', 'son', 'JRM', 'lend', 'reasons', 'be', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'are', 'weakening', 'purpose', 'plot', 'only', 'insight', 'introverted', 'weak', 'scientific', 'husband', 'Tom', 'Wilikinson', 'who', 'eventually', 'prey', 'Driver', 'wiles', 'exotic', 'creativity.Driver', 'character', 'Rosina', 'very', 'conflicting', 'eager', 'be', 'useful', 'too', 'easily', 'wanton', 'industrious/creative', 'when', 'discoveries', 'photography', 'movie', 'aspects', 'budding', 'feminist', 'aware', 'body', 'determined', 'be', 'acknowledged', 'part', 'discoveries', 'science.But', 'other', 'hand', 'also', 'begs', 'forgiveness', 'attention', 'weeps', 'tantrums', 'film', 'shows', 'hardly', 'supposed', 'education/teaching', 'reason', 'employed', 'first', 'place', 'So', 'aspect', 'weak', 'female', 'depending', 'employer-turned', 'lover', 'inconsistency', 'irritating', 'development', 'Then', 'dramatic', 'turn', 'suddenly', 'scorned', 'lover', 'vengeful', 'reckless', 'who', 'family', 'embracing', 'heratige', 'new-found', 'knowledge', 'unexpected', 'strength', 'again', 'attesting', 'character', 'inconsistency.To', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys-Meyers', 'character', 'blip', 'film', 'solely', 'reveal', 'Driver', 'true', 'identity', 'Father', 'play', 'overdramatic', 'part', 'infatuated', 'young', 'son', 'obsession', 'Rosina', 'top', 'considering', 'how', 'little', 'film', 'time', 'nowhere', 'when', 'family', 'end', 'flailing', 'naked', 'ocean', 'curled', 'up', 'fetal', 'position', 'weeping', 'sandy', 'waves', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'little', 'basis', 'Not', 'mention', 'here', 'lover', 'scenes', 'film', 'male', 'full', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'placed', 'solely', 'attempt', 'dark', 'artsiness', 'So', 'Rosina', 'empowered', 'woman', 'going', ""'back"", 'people', 'stolen', 'photo', 'lenses', 'creating', 'own', 'photography', 'business', 'time', 'frame', 'gauge', 'how', 'quickly', 'broken', 'family', 'taken', 'rags', 'riches', 'again', 'attributed', 'film', 'choppy', 'storyline', 'throughout.All', 'film', 'characters', 'were', 'cliched', 'when', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'fleshed', 'out', 'movie', 'lacked', 'depth', 'attempted', 'artsy-fartsiness', 'failed', 'opinion', 'due', 'inconsistency', 'rushed', 'timelines', 'chopiness']",N/A
11000,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,0767811429,Z Hayes,"[1, 1]","""The Governess"" has Minnie Driver playing a feisty Sephardic Jewess in 1840s London whose diminished circumstances compels her to seek out a position as Governess with a well-heeled family in Scotland. She assumes the false identity of Gentile Mary Blackchurch and has to deal with a very dysfunctional family - there's the man of the house played by Tom Wilkinson, his haughty and whiny wife, a morbid young daughter Clementine, and the teenage never-do-well rebellious son [played by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers].Soon, a close bond develops between Rosina and the master of the house, and results in an affair. Whilst indulging in each other, Rosina takes the opportunity to master the finer points of the art of photography, which was in its developmental stages at the time. The rebellious son meanwhile becomes hopelessly infatuated with Rosina, even more so after he discovers her true identity as he is drawn to her 'differences'. There's lots of emotional drama that ensues and Rosina struggles to find her place in the world.The strength of the movie lies in the camerawork. The cinematography of the Scottish coastline is beautiful as is the portrayal of the photography lessons. But most striking of all for me was the hypnotizing and beautifully shot scenes of the Jewish rituals that seemed almost magical and surreal.What I felt was lacking though was true insights into the characters - the Gentile family that Rosina works for is portrayed as dysfunctional, but there is no credible explanation or exploration as to why this is so. The viewer is supposed to just accept this as a fact.As for Rosina, though her character was well-portrayed by Minnie Driver, I felt there was no deep insight into the conflict between her close affinity for Judaism vs the stressful situation engendered by her assuming a false Gentile identity. What did seem genuine was Rosina/Mary's true affection for Tom Wilkinson's character. Minnie Driver does have expressive eyes and she uses this to great effect. Tom Wilkinson's character was also credibly drawn, though I didn't think the full frontal nude scenes were necessary [both him and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers].On the whole, I did like this movie from an aesthetic point of view, though it could have done with more insightful characterization.",3,"Beautifully shot, yet lacking in insights",1236643200,"03 10, 2009",2009,2284,"['Governess', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'playing', 'feisty', 'Sephardic', 'Jewess', '1840s', 'London', 'diminished', 'circumstances', 'seek', 'out', 'position', 'Governess', 'well-heeled', 'family', 'Scotland', 'false', 'identity', 'Gentile', 'Mary', 'Blackchurch', 'deal', 'very', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'man', 'house', 'played', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'haughty', 'whiny', 'wife', 'morbid', 'young', 'daughter', 'Clementine', 'teenage', 'never-do-well', 'rebellious', 'son', '[', 'played', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys-Meyers', ']', '.Soon', 'close', 'bond', 'Rosina', 'master', 'house', 'results', 'affair', 'Whilst', 'indulging', 'other', 'Rosina', 'opportunity', 'master', 'finer', 'points', 'art', 'photography', 'was', 'developmental', 'stages', 'time', 'rebellious', 'son', 'meanwhile', 'hopelessly', 'infatuated', 'Rosina', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'true', 'identity', 'drawn', ""'differences"", 'lots', 'emotional', 'drama', 'Rosina', 'struggles', 'find', 'place', 'world.The', 'strength', 'movie', 'camerawork', 'cinematography', 'Scottish', 'coastline', 'beautiful', 'portrayal', 'photography', 'lessons', 'most', 'striking', 'was', 'hypnotizing', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'scenes', 'Jewish', 'rituals', 'seemed', 'almost', 'magical', 'surreal.What', 'felt', 'was', 'lacking', 'was', 'true', 'insights', 'characters', 'Gentile', 'family', 'Rosina', 'works', 'portrayed', 'dysfunctional', 'credible', 'explanation', 'exploration', 'why', 'so', 'viewer', 'supposed', 'just', 'accept', 'fact.As', 'Rosina', 'character', 'was', 'well-portrayed', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'felt', 'was', 'deep', 'insight', 'conflict', 'close', 'affinity', 'Judaism', 'vs', 'stressful', 'situation', 'engendered', 'assuming', 'false', 'Gentile', 'identity', 'What', 'did', 'seem', 'genuine', 'was', 'Rosina/Mary', 'true', 'affection', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'character', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'have', 'expressive', 'eyes', 'great', 'effect', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'character', 'was', 'also', 'credibly', 'drawn', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'full', 'frontal', 'nude', 'scenes', 'were', 'necessary', '[', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys-Meyers', ']', '.On', 'whole', 'did', 'like', 'movie', 'aesthetic', 'point', 'view', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'more', 'insightful', 'characterization']",N/A
