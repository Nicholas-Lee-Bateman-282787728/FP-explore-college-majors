He leaves her a book that tells the tale of a feud between two families.  As she reads, she finds that she is a member of one of the families and now must find the cause of the feud and correct this before her home known as Moonacre is destroyed forever.There are many great actors in this film.  I will not name them all.  Yet one actor that stands out immediately is Tim Curry.  Mr. Curry has been in more than 80 films including Muppet Treasure Island (1996) where he plays a professional ""Long John Silver.""This movie has a nice title ""The Secret of Moonacre"" loosely based on the book ""The Little White Horse"" by Elizabeth Goudge.  There are many movies with titles that look like they should belong to kid's books or viewable by children and turn out to be psychological thrillers on the dark side.  However this time if the type of film you are looking for is the lighter fairytale child friendly movie you're in luck; this movie is a magical movie that is kid friendly.

1361117,A3M4C2VDWYJSSA,B003RHZ6I4,Compusurge,"[37, 40]","The Secret of Moonacre played at our local theater last evening and I caught it with my daughter (age 10) who had seen the trailer for it recently and had been talking about it ever since. What a beautiful film, both physically (what you see) as well as story-wise (what you get).A filmed fairy tale based on the acclaimed novel ""The Little White Horse"", the story of a young girl recently orphaned is filled with joy, fright, heartbreak, laughter, love, hate and hope. Sent to live with her eccentric uncle at his very mysterious home of Moonacre Manor, a young Maria finds herself in a world of magic and myth. Discovering that an ancient family feud has kept Moonacre in danger for many a year, Maria also learns that she is the next moon princess and that she alone may be able to succeed where others before her have failed. From there, the story takes you on a journey that is captivating throughout as Maria attempts to save Moonacre from slipping into eternal darkness, something that must be accomplished before the 5000th moon rises, something she cannot quite accomplish alone. As I do not want to put any spoilers within this commentary, I will only tell you that the final scene of this film is simply upliftingly fantastic.The Secret of Moonacre is perfectly suited for children. I would say for ages 8-15, more for girls than boys, but there are elements to the film that boys, too, will enjoy. The special effects are superb starting with Maria's bedroom which is located atop Moonacre Manor with a clear ceiling that lets her view the starry / dreamy nights while laying in her bed. For girls there is a beautiful Unicorn and a very rare Moonacre rabbit; for boys there are outlaws in the forest (led by Tim Curry btw), an evil-looking but protective dog and an extroadinarily unique black lion. Moonacre is a love story and Moonacre is a joyous fairytale. It is a film with a female lead herione who challenges a world she faces that is filled with obstacles. Moonacre comes complete with lessons taught (i.e. how jealously and hate are destructive and yet they can be overcome). It is a film definitely worth repeating as its filled with small details that only repeat viewing will expose. The Secret of Moonacre is destined for greatness.My daughter already wants to own it and for sure, she will.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[44, 46]","A unicorn, an ancient curse, magical pearls, a blood feud, a forest haunted by bandits, and a bit of ""Romeo and Juliet"" romance (without the suicide). ""The Secret of Moonacre"" is something of a modern fairy tale, and Gabor Csupo films it in the style is deserves -- a lush, exquisitely magical little tale full of magic.When her father dies, Maria Merrywether (Dakota Blue Richards) discovers that his debts have left her penniless -- all she inherits is a storybook about the Moon Princess and her magical pearls.She and her governess are sent to live with Sir Benjamin Merryweather (Ioan Gruffudd), her grumpy uncle who lives in a vast decaying mansion. But soon Maria begins to realize that something strange is afoot -- it turns out the story of the Moon Pearls is true, and a strange young woman named Loveday (Natascha McElhone) warns her of what will happen in just a few days.And along the way, she discovers that the Merryweathers and the bandit clan called the De Noirs have been at war over the pearls for centuries. However, the only way that Maria can find the pearls is by enlisting the help of Robin De Noir (Augustus Prew) -- and if she doesn't succeed, the entire valley of Moonacre will be destroyed.""The Secret of Moonacre"" is loosely based on Elizabeth Goudge's classic fantasy novel ""The Little White Horse,"" although they take some hefty liberties in the name of drama. However, it's still a lovely little movie with a distinctly British flavor, as well as a mixture of wide-eyed optimism and the usual stuff about pride, getting along, love overcoming all, and so on.The script is a mixed bag -- the dialogue has moments of banality (""It is not the pearls but the greed in our hearts which brings us this misery""), but also some enchanting humour (""How can I possibly go to live in the country? It's full of... the countryside!""). And a small warning: the De Noirs look like refugees from ""A Clockwork Orange.""But the movie is worth getting if nothing else for the sets and scenery. Director Gabor Csupo paints the entire movie with lush magical forests, a bandit citadel with a dungeon, a bedroom with murals and a sea-bed, dusty old libraries and an overgrown kitchen where an elfin cook bounces around like a Lewis Carroll character. Nearly every scene looks like a pre-Raphaelite painting, and Csupo milks it of every ounce of fairy-tale beauty and magic.And though this is only her second movie, Dakota Blue Richards easily takes center stage and gives a gutsy flair to her ladylike character. Gruffudd and McElhone are quite good as the grumpy aristocrat and the pretty hermit, and Tim Curry is sneeringly nasty as Coeur De Noir (although he seems totally lost in the last scene).""The Secret of Moonacre"" has some flaws, but it's still a charming little fairytale that enchants the senses and makes you feel warm'n'fuzzy.

This endeavor was ultimately letdown by inconsonant direction, story mishandling, and casting errors.  Sadly, all this movie produced was one long dissonant note, oh what might have been.At times it seemed like two different movies attempting to coexist in the same framework.  There was slapstick in one house and shouts of ""kill the girl!"" in the other.  A disappearing unicorn, a lion/dog, a chef who can't stay long in one spot, a belching governess, a reject from A Clockwork Orange, thugs with knives bent on slitting throats, and a vicious Tim Curry sporting a comic hood (like those put on birds of prey).  What do all these elements have in common?  By mere coincidence they just happen to be in the same movie, or, at least that's how it feels.  It also didn't help that the story got off to a slow start then kept veering awkwardly from fun and funny to deadly serious and just deadly.  Ioan Gruffudd lacked commitment (I got the impression he'd rather be somewhere else doing something better), ""get my agent, why am I in this?""

It's a cute little fairy tale story, particularly aimed towards young girls. However, two aspects really undermine the movie for me. First, the plot seems half-baked. You don't really learn enough about the families and their feud and the power of the pearls until long into the movie. The ending and Maria Merryweather's choice seem highly contrived (I won't spoil it, but let's just say it's a big leap of faith). Overall, it seems like we only get tiny tastes of that sort of magic, but the character development and acting aren't enough to make up for the lack of wonder. The other big problem is that the wardrobes are awful. The bad guys wear outfits that look like they come straight out of Clockwork Orange.Maria always seems to find herself in some 19th century ball gown, which just doesn't inspire adventure.

I suspect a saga like Lord of the Rings would be required to get that across though.There is a lot going on, visually and via story line.There is a good start to the story when the curse is explained and the reason for the blood feud.The premise is basic enough:  a sacred gift with special powers is given to a deserving person. Those around that person are undeserving and so create problems when they learn about it, and covet it. The supernatural giver gets offended, and a curse happens to those who abused the gift and/or the virtuous, worthy person. Someone way down the hereditary line ends up paying for the sins of the ancestors and has to put things right. A few supernatural critters get thrown in.I'd have liked to know more about the fey in the story - assuming the cook and Lovejoy have fey powers from what the movie shows - and seen more of the lion and unicorn. As it is, the unicorn looks like a blurry white horse, and I didn't know it was a unicorn til I read the reviews.I'm glad it ended happily, but am unclear just what happened at the end when the heroine tried to break the curse and jumped into the sea ... we just see that good came of it. I wasn't satisfied with just that.Other reviewers said plenty about the bedroom ceiling and the outfits, so leave it at that.Also, happy this is not an ""occult propaganda"" film, promoting or justifying sorcery, spellcasting, or any other kind of supernaturalism. It's only what was needed to tell the story without centering the tale on pursuit of power or human-monster relationships.

Bowler hats, Robin (i.e. Batman version) masks and black eye underliner - unimaginative. Cawing crows and shrieking hawks, especially when overdone as a time filler and mood setter, were just tedious.(4.) Storyline, directing and editing: How much can one unimaginably steal from other movies ""Lion, Witch & Wardrobe"", ""The Last Unicorn"", ""Neverending Story"" and others.

It is definitely not a blockbuster and would be considered perhaps more of a B class film in terms of acting and digital graphics.  However, we thought the graphics and acting were fine and surpassed our initial expectations.  The did plot seem a bit lacking, but that might be due to its adaptation from a supposedly beloved novel.  Movies never do seem to translate to film in the same quality and quantity.To be quite honest, my wife and I have not had the opportunity to read this novel, so we took the film at face value.  As such, we were still pleased with the film for what it was.There is an interview listed in the special features that points out an interesting thought, that is that J. K. Rowling loved this book and used it as inspiration for her Harry Potter series.  This is very interesting because you can see many connections and similarities (unicorn, snatcher like characters, etc).  We wonder how many more similarities might be present in the book as well.  We are not saying she stole any ideas, so lets not go down that path, it is just interesting to see where some of her inspiration stemmed from.In either case, the piano song in this film is beautiful and who doesn't enjoy Tim Curry.

The story needed to be tightened up and altered for the movie, but many of the film-makers' additions and changes made the story even weaker. The worst change was probably the recasting of Robin as not only one of the thugs but (weirdly) as the boy from ""A Clockwork Orange."" The revised Moonacre legend was so hokey and so miserably acted that I almost turned the DVD off. Maria's uncle and Loveday were both awful, and they topped off their performances with a sloppy kiss that should turn any preteen girl against sex for a couple of years.I didn't mind the idea (new to the movie) that Moonacre Valley would be destroyed by the 5000th moon unless the Moon Princess's pearls were returned to the sea. If they could have been returned without heavy doses of slapstick, cliche, and misogyny (that's contempt for women, which surfaced in the book but was much worse here), the movie might have had a chance.

While there, magical things happen and she is instructed not to go into the forest where the Du Noirs roam. (They all dress in black.)You don't see too much of the unicorn and lion on the cover, but they are in the film.This is a movie adults can enjoy watching with their kids and also one for people who enjoy the type of names and symbolism one sees in Harry Potter. The movie has magical devices, but unlike Potter there is no real spell casting witchcraft.

Right from the very beginning, I was hooked! There's always something enchanting about a moon princess, even if I don't really know what that means.When Maria is forced to leave her home and stay with an uncle she never knew she had, she's more than unhappy. She doesn't know where she is or who this man is and most importantly; she doesn't know what's up with that strange white horse, those bandits in the forest she's being told she can't go into or why the stars on her bedroom ceiling are moving! All she knows is that there is something very strange going on and her uncle seems to know, but isn't telling her.Maria is your typical curious little girl who dives head first into danger just because someone told her not go there. She's brave and adventurous and pretty darn sneaky! I absolutely loved Maria, even if every time she set foot into the forest it made me cringe. I also loved her dresses (they had a sort of Wicked Musical Emerald City feel to them) and her bedroom! Oh my, how I would love a magical bedroom like that one!Robin was also another character I really liked, from the very beginning he catches your attention, or maybe it was just me... he sort of reminded me of Rufio, but his costume was much better (Robin's, not Rufio's). The more he has to set out to capture Maria, the more you can sort of sense he doesn't want to... which makes you wonder why not? His father seems to be obsessed with seeking revenge, it's strange to wonder why Robin didn't follow in those footsteps. Even if his father seems a bit... loopy about it all.All the characters in this movie were fantastic. There was humor, magic and secrets. I absolutely enjoyed it and I personally think it deserves more attention! If you're in the mood for a light movie about magic, then I suggest you give this a try!I didn't know this movie was a sort of retelling of a book -- ""The Little White Horse"" by Elizabeth Goudge, never heard of it but definitely going to get it out now!",5,Absolutely enchanting!,1322352000,"11 27, 2011",2011,2094,"['husband', 'was', 'randomly', 'browsing', 'Netflix', 'cover', 'image', 'movie', 'caught', 'eye', 'settled', 'watching', 'Right', 'very', 'beginning', 'was', 'hooked', 'always', 'something', 'enchanting', 'moon', 'princess', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'what', 'means.When', 'Maria', 'forced', 'leave', 'home', 'stay', 'uncle', 'never', 'knew', 'had', 'more', 'unhappy', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'who', 'man', 'most', 'importantly', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'up', 'strange', 'white', 'horse', 'bandits', 'forest', 'being', 'told', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'why', 'stars', 'bedroom', 'ceiling', 'are', 'moving', 'something', 'very', 'strange', 'going', 'uncle', 'know', ""n't"", 'telling', 'her.Maria', 'typical', 'curious', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'head', 'first', 'danger', 'just', 'someone', 'told', 'not', 'go', 'there', 'brave', 'adventurous', 'pretty', 'darn', 'sneaky', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'Maria', 'even', 'time', 'set', 'foot', 'forest', 'made', 'cringe', 'also', 'loved', 'dresses', 'had', 'sort', 'Wicked', 'Musical', 'Emerald', 'City', 'feel', 'bedroom', 'Oh', 'how', 'would', 'love', 'magical', 'bedroom', 'one', 'Robin', 'was', 'also', 'character', 'really', 'liked', 'very', 'beginning', 'attention', 'maybe', 'was', 'just', 'sort', 'reminded', 'Rufio', 'costume', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'Robin', 'not', 'Rufio', 'more', 'set', 'out', 'capture', 'Maria', 'more', 'can', 'sort', 'sense', ""n't"", 'want', 'wonder', 'why', 'not', 'father', 'be', 'obsessed', 'seeking', 'revenge', 'strange', 'wonder', 'why', 'Robin', 'did', ""n't"", 'follow', 'footsteps', 'Even', 'father', 'bit', 'characters', 'movie', 'were', 'fantastic', 'was', 'humor', 'magic', 'secrets', 'absolutely', 'enjoyed', 'personally', 'think', 'more', 'attention', ""'re"", 'mood', 'light', 'movie', 'magic', 'then', 'suggest', 'give', 'try', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'movie', 'was', 'sort', 'retelling', 'book', 'Little', 'White', 'Horse', 'Elizabeth', 'Goudge', 'never', 'heard', 'definitely', 'going', 'get', 'out', 'now']",N/A

She's been asking me if there are any other fantasy-themed movies she can watch and after scrolling through a couple of titles, I came across The Secret of Moonacre. We watched it together and it is wonderful family entertainment. Although the target audience is elementary-aged children to young adults, I found myself enchanted by the movie. It is well-cast and beautifully filmed.The story centers around 13-year-old Maria Merryweather (Dakota Blue Richards), who finds herself penniless and without a home after her beloved father's death. Accompanied by her faithful governess, Miss Heliotrope (Juliet Stevenson), the pair move from busy London to remote Moonacre Valley to live with Maria's reclusive uncle, Sir Benjamin (Ioan Gruffudd). There Maria begins experiencing strange happenings, and soon comes to understand that Moonacre Valley and its inhabitants are under a curse, brought about by men's greed. Soon it dawns upon Maria that she is the Moon Princess and it is left to her to find the missing moon pearls and bring peace to the valley once again.The lead actress does an incredible job in her role as the spirited Maria Merryweather. This young lass has talent and looks to take her far. The supporting cast does a good job too - Ioan Gruffudd is credible as the brooding and lovelorn Sir Benjamin; Natascha McElhone convincingly  portrays his estranged betrothed Loveday;and,  Tim Curry is a hoot as the villain Coeur De Noir.There are shades of Narnia in this film, especially in the portrayal of the forbidding and loyal black lion.
