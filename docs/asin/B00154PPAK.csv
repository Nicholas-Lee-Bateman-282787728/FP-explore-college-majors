The REAL Egyptians married thier daughters and thier worship of death and torture was codified in their book of the dead. The Pharoahs were cruel and demonic kings who thought little of the &#34;commoners&#34;. The first fake project to keep commoners busy was the Tower of Babel, the second was Gizeh, ours is fake global warming, terrorism, drug &#34;wars&#34; etc. The NWO will be much like the Pharaohnic times, we're 90% there. It's very distasteful to me that the movie egyptians are portrayed as essentially Christians in everyday customs and morals. They were worshippers of Nimrod/Babylon as Osiris/Horus/Isis is only a version of Nimrod/Tammuz/Semiramis and this results in things like ritualistic human sacrifice, pedophilia, cannibalism, drugs, trauma based mind control etc which goes on in elite and not so elite circles if you can wake up from your matrix life.",1,"Total historical disinformation, recommended by Temple of Set btw",1404172800,"07 1, 2014",2014,1011,"['movie', 'recommended', 'Michael', 'Aquino', 'child', 'molesting', 'satanist', 'black', 'magic', 'book', 'Temple', 'Set', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'REAL', 'Egyptians', 'married', 'thier', 'daughters', 'thier', 'worship', 'death', 'torture', 'was', 'codified', 'book', 'dead', 'Pharoahs', 'were', 'cruel', 'demonic', 'kings', 'who', 'thought', 'little', '34', 'commoners', '34', 'first', 'fake', 'project', 'keep', 'commoners', 'busy', 'was', 'Tower', 'Babel', 'second', 'was', 'Gizeh', 'ours', 'fake', 'global', 'warming', 'terrorism', 'drug', '34', 'wars', '34', 'etc', 'NWO', 'will', 'be', 'much', 'Pharaohnic', 'times', ""'re"", '90', '%', 'there', 'very', 'distasteful', 'movie', 'egyptians', 'are', 'portrayed', 'essentially', 'Christians', 'everyday', 'customs', 'morals', 'were', 'worshippers', 'Nimrod/Babylon', 'Osiris/Horus/Isis', 'only', 'version', 'Nimrod/Tammuz/Semiramis', 'results', 'things', 'ritualistic', 'human', 'sacrifice', 'pedophilia', 'cannibalism', 'drugs', 'trauma', 'based', 'mind', 'control', 'etc', 'elite', 'not', 'so', 'elite', 'circles', 'can', 'wake', 'up', 'matrix', 'life']",N/A

1148668,A1O6OZ0NNH3CR4,B00154PPAK,Chuck Snow,"[6, 7]","This is one of those early CinemaScope epics that you either love or hate. Well, I'm one of the lucky ones to have watched this one in its original release, when wide screen was considered a novelty, when the screen stopped being this boxy little thing and sprawled out to engulf you. And I loved every second of it. I was eleven. Yes, it is talky as are most early wide screen efforts: filmmakers were terrified of freaking out an audience by the use of close-ups or too much cutting between different angles, etc. So the films come across almost as filmed stage plays. However, there's enough action in The Egyptian (as in a terrific lion and chariot chase accompanied by the electrifying score by the gifted Bernard Herrman), to keep one awake. And the production design is still quite stunning.This is the story of an orphaned prince cast in the river and raised by not so simple folks. He becomes a physician and is lucky to cross paths in his youth with an epileptic Pharaoh, thus acquiring entry into higher echelons. His involvement with a femme fatale derails him however and he makes enough enemies to warrant exile. It is a film of quest and redemption, and not an action flick, though there are plenty of skirmishes along the way.Marlon Brando was supposed to play the lead, but he backed out and chose another box-office disappointment instead (the equally gorgeous, but static 'Desiree'). Brit import, Edmund Purdom, stepped in. It did nothing for his career, not that his other movies made a dent at the box office either. The cast by today's standards is quite inadequate (Michael Wilding as Pharaoh, the weakest), but the tragic Bella Darvi, for years ridiculed by almost every one just because she was a playgirl in real life, comes off best as the foreign temptress who ruins the naive leading man.Now, for the Blu-Ray DVD: it does not get any better than this, particularly on a 55 inch flat-screen. A tack sharp image with scrumptious color. Somehow, they got rid of the early CinemaScope graininess and the ghastly greenish hue of the 'Color By De Luxe' of that era. The price is high, granted, but if you have Blu-Ray or intend to upgrade, pay the exhorbitant price. Pretend to yourself that you're buying something from the Criterion Collection and you will not regret it. Why Fox Studios never bothered to release this CinemaScope goody earlier, yet released other more undistinguished ones is beyond my comprehension. Then when they now decide to put it at long last on DVD, they make it almost unaffordable to most fans. Unbelievable. Still, better pay the official price of this limited edition, 'cause you know what will happen to that price once the stock runs dry and it falls in the hands of true scalpers.",5,Blu-Ray At Its Best,1318204800,"10 10, 2011",2011,2738,"['one', 'early', 'CinemaScope', 'epics', 'love', 'hate', 'Well', ""'m"", 'one', 'lucky', 'ones', 'have', 'watched', 'one', 'original', 'release', 'when', 'wide', 'screen', 'was', 'considered', 'novelty', 'when', 'screen', 'stopped', 'being', 'boxy', 'little', 'thing', 'sprawled', 'out', 'engulf', 'loved', 'second', 'was', 'eleven', 'Yes', 'talky', 'are', 'most', 'early', 'wide', 'screen', 'efforts', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'terrified', 'freaking', 'out', 'audience', 'use', 'close-ups', 'too', 'much', 'cutting', 'different', 'angles', 'etc', 'films', 'come', 'across', 'almost', 'filmed', 'stage', 'plays', 'However', 'enough', 'action', 'Egyptian', 'terrific', 'lion', 'chariot', 'chase', 'accompanied', 'electrifying', 'score', 'gifted', 'Bernard', 'Herrman', 'keep', 'one', 'awake', 'production', 'design', 'still', 'quite', 'stunning.This', 'story', 'orphaned', 'prince', 'cast', 'river', 'raised', 'not', 'so', 'simple', 'folks', 'physician', 'lucky', 'cross', 'paths', 'youth', 'epileptic', 'Pharaoh', 'thus', 'acquiring', 'entry', 'higher', 'echelons', 'involvement', 'femme', 'fatale', 'however', 'enough', 'enemies', 'warrant', 'exile', 'film', 'quest', 'redemption', 'not', 'action', 'flick', 'are', 'plenty', 'skirmishes', 'way.Marlon', 'Brando', 'was', 'supposed', 'play', 'lead', 'backed', 'out', 'chose', 'box-office', 'disappointment', 'instead', 'equally', 'gorgeous', 'static', ""'Desiree"", 'Brit', 'import', 'Edmund', 'Purdom', 'stepped', 'did', 'nothing', 'career', 'not', 'other', 'movies', 'made', 'dent', 'box', 'office', 'either', 'cast', 'today', 'standards', 'quite', 'inadequate', 'Michael', 'Wilding', 'Pharaoh', 'weakest', 'tragic', 'Bella', 'Darvi', 'years', 'ridiculed', 'almost', 'one', 'just', 'was', 'playgirl', 'real', 'life', 'off', 'best', 'foreign', 'temptress', 'who', 'naive', 'leading', 'man.Now', 'Blu-Ray', 'DVD', 'not', 'get', 'better', 'particularly', '55', 'inch', 'flat-screen', 'tack', 'sharp', 'image', 'scrumptious', 'color', 'Somehow', 'got', 'rid', 'early', 'CinemaScope', 'graininess', 'ghastly', 'greenish', 'hue', ""'Color"", 'De', 'Luxe', 'era', 'price', 'high', 'granted', 'have', 'Blu-Ray', 'intend', 'upgrade', 'pay', 'exhorbitant', 'price', 'Pretend', 'yourself', ""'re"", 'buying', 'something', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'will', 'not', 'regret', 'Why', 'Fox', 'Studios', 'never', 'bothered', 'release', 'CinemaScope', 'goody', 'earlier', 'yet', 'released', 'other', 'more', 'undistinguished', 'ones', 'comprehension', 'Then', 'when', 'now', 'decide', 'put', 'long', 'last', 'DVD', 'make', 'almost', 'unaffordable', 'most', 'fans', 'Unbelievable', 'Still', 'better', 'pay', 'official', 'price', 'limited', 'edition', 'know', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'price', 'once', 'stock', 'dry', 'hands', 'true', 'scalpers']",N/A

1148670,A8MVGWI5ZKNQ5,B00154PPAK,Daisy Brambletoes,"[2, 3]","The story of Pharaoh Ankhenaten is not as well known as some.  In fact, his own people tried to drive out his memory since his pacifism allowed Egypt's enemies to invade and very nearly conquer.  This is the only film I am aware of about the man inspired and influenced by Joseph Ben Jacob, whose story is known from the Book of Exodus.  He came quite awhile after Joseph, but his belief in the One God three centuries before Moses, is profound revisted in the Judeo-Christian histories.  The history portions of this story, therefore, or more or less correct.  Several generations of Pharaohs are encapsulated to tell this story from the viewpoint of a contemporary physician.The physician is an unlikely and largely unsympathetic wimp of a hero.  His youthful ideals and aspirations easily disintegrate, crumbling under the alure of a scheming and even less sympathetic courtesan who nearly destroys him.  The best and most likable character is Peter Ustinov as the physician's servant/orderly/friend. Victor Mature (as a soldier and future Pharaoh himself)is a good foil for his physician friend. And the Pharaoh Ankhenaten himself is magnificent.In some ways this film is long and slow-moving, but at the same time, it hypnotizes you.

Now, if this picture only could have decided what kindof movie it wanted to be! Early on, it appears it is going to be action and adventure,as we watch Victor Mature attempting to spear what appear to be truly humongous lionsin the desert. Then it seems to be turning into an Egyptian version of the ""Sufferingsof Young Werther"" with ""he (the Egyptian, played by Edmund Purdom) wants her, she doesn't want him"" (with Bella Darvi). Then there's ""she wants him, he doesn't want her (with Jean Simmons). Then later in the film Gene Tierney wants him, but he doesn't want her--or to be Pharaoh. When the Egyptian is exiled, the film seems to turn into a kind of travelogue. Sometimes it reverts to previous stages.The prevailing idea seems to be that  little-known Edmund Purdom was not up to the task of portraying the hero, especially when compared to Marlon Brando, who was originally selected for the role. Honestly, though, I'm not sure even Brando could have redeemed this script. But is the script really at fault or the book on which it is based?It's hard to answer that question because I haven't read Mika Waltari's novel. The commentary is no help because the two commentators destroy their credibility early on when one of them refers to Peter Ustinov's appearance in ""The Robe."" Only problem is Ustinovwasn't in ""The Robe,"" he played Nero in ""Quo Vadis,"" (for MGM); Jay Robinson played Neroin ""The Robe"" and its followup ""Demetrius and the Gladiators,"" both for 20thCentury Foxwhich licensed ""The Egyptian"" to Screen Archives Entertainment (Twilight Time). Thisfundamental error remains uncorrected by the other commentator. To call these twogentlemen ""film historians"" (back of disc case), by the standards of our superficial, self-indulgent age, may not be that much of a stretch, but, trust me, folks, Rudy Behlmerand Roger Ebert they aren't.This raises the question of quality control. Probably the gorgeously restored picture and sound must be credited to Fox--I've heard that it was already in their ""assets vault"" whenthey licensed it to Twilight Time. The choice of ""film historians"" for commentary probably falls at the door of Twilight Time. Much comment has been made on the Internet about the steep prices Twilight Time is charging for its blu-ray releases, but they are probably havingto do things on the cheap. We can be grateful that a film such as ""The Egyptian"" wasreleased at all, and Fox probably didn't license it to Twilight Time at a bargain basementprice. Still, it would have been nice to have a commentator up to the task of speculatingon whether or not Hollywood might have been pushing the envelope with (then) Christian America with such things as the graverobber scene. There John Carradine seems, like a atheist out of today's headlines, to be getting in the face of the audiencewith his comment that nothing of the individual survives after death. Then of course,there is the final comment emblazoned across the screen that ""all of this happened blah blahyears before Jesus Christ""--a not so subtle reminder that the monotheism idea did not beginwith Judaism or Christianity.Given these elements in the film, possibly partly calculated to instruct, but probablyturning off many Jews and Christians, it is scarcely a mystery that it wasa commercial failure when released. I can only marvel that it was shown in the smallNorth Carolina town where I had the opportunity to see it. I am glad that I purchasedthis blu-ray edition, even though the film is an extremely episodic curiosity. Picture and sound quality make it worthwhile, though the hero doesn't really seem to undergo any great character development or change. He's basically the same moping bloke at the end as he seems to be in most of the picture. One wonders why any of the three female leads would have givenhim the time of day. I will watch ""The Egyptian"" again because of the great productionvalues of the film, quality of the blu ray, wonderful music (Alfred Newman and Bernard Hermann) and the number of actors who were well known in their day, most deservedly so. But, please, Twilight Time, if money is  an issue, drop the commentaries in future releases, unless you're going to exert more quality control--we don't need people of limited knowledge insulting our intelligence and knowledge of cinema history.",4,"""Fifties weird"" but a ""modern"" release in the worse sort of way!",1328572800,"02 7, 2012",2012,4534,"['purchased', 'item', 'thought', 'had', 'seen', 'kid', '1950s', 'family', 'viewing', 'confirmed', 'be', 'case', 'restoration', 'fabulous', 'picture', 'quality', 'audio', 'leave', 'little', 'be', 'desired', 'Now', 'picture', 'only', 'could', 'have', 'decided', 'what', 'movie', 'wanted', 'be', 'Early', 'going', 'be', 'action', 'adventure', 'watch', 'Victor', 'Mature', 'attempting', 'spear', 'what', 'appear', 'be', 'truly', 'humongous', 'desert', 'Then', 'be', 'turning', 'Egyptian', 'version', 'Sufferingsof', 'Young', 'Werther', 'Egyptian', 'played', 'Edmund', 'Purdom', ""n't"", 'want', 'Bella', 'Darvi', 'Then', ""n't"", 'want', 'Jean', 'Simmons', 'Then', 'later', 'film', 'Gene', 'Tierney', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'Pharaoh', 'When', 'Egyptian', 'exiled', 'film', 'turn', 'kind', 'travelogue', 'previous', 'stages.The', 'prevailing', 'idea', 'be', 'little-known', 'Edmund', 'Purdom', 'was', 'not', 'up', 'task', 'portraying', 'hero', 'especially', 'when', 'compared', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'who', 'was', 'originally', 'selected', 'role', 'Honestly', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'even', 'Brando', 'could', 'have', 'redeemed', 'script', 'script', 'really', 'fault', 'book', 'based', 'hard', 'answer', 'question', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'Mika', 'Waltari', 'novel', 'commentary', 'help', 'two', 'commentators', 'destroy', 'credibility', 'early', 'when', 'one', 'refers', 'Peter', 'Ustinov', 'appearance', 'Robe', 'Only', 'problem', 'Ustinovwas', ""n't"", 'Robe', 'played', 'Nero', 'Quo', 'Vadis', 'MGM', 'Jay', 'Robinson', 'played', 'Neroin', 'Robe', 'followup', 'Demetrius', 'Gladiators', '20thCentury', 'Foxwhich', 'licensed', 'Egyptian', 'Screen', 'Archives', 'Entertainment', 'Twilight', 'Time', 'Thisfundamental', 'error', 'uncorrected', 'other', 'commentator', 'call', 'twogentlemen', 'film', 'historians', 'back', 'disc', 'case', 'standards', 'superficial', 'self-indulgent', 'age', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'much', 'stretch', 'trust', 'folks', 'Rudy', 'Behlmerand', 'Roger', 'Ebert', ""aren't.This"", 'question', 'quality', 'control', 'Probably', 'gorgeously', 'restored', 'picture', 'sound', 'must', 'be', 'credited', 'Fox', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'was', 'already', 'assets', 'vault', 'whenthey', 'licensed', 'Twilight', 'Time', 'choice', 'film', 'historians', 'commentary', 'probably', 'door', 'Twilight', 'Time', 'Much', 'comment', 'been', 'made', 'Internet', 'steep', 'prices', 'Twilight', 'Time', 'charging', 'blu-ray', 'releases', 'are', 'probably', 'havingto', 'do', 'things', 'cheap', 'can', 'be', 'grateful', 'film', 'such', 'Egyptian', 'wasreleased', 'Fox', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'license', 'Twilight', 'Time', 'bargain', 'basementprice', 'Still', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'commentator', 'up', 'task', 'speculatingon', 'not', 'Hollywood', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'pushing', 'envelope', 'then', 'Christian', 'America', 'such', 'things', 'graverobber', 'scene', 'John', 'Carradine', 'atheist', 'today', 'headlines', 'be', 'getting', 'face', 'audiencewith', 'comment', 'nothing', 'individual', 'survives', 'death', 'Then', 'course', 'final', 'comment', 'emblazoned', 'screen', 'happened', 'blah', 'blahyears', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'not', 'so', 'subtle', 'reminder', 'monotheism', 'idea', 'did', 'not', 'beginwith', 'Judaism', 'Christianity.Given', 'elements', 'film', 'possibly', 'partly', 'calculated', 'instruct', 'probablyturning', 'off', 'many', 'Jews', 'Christians', 'scarcely', 'mystery', 'commercial', 'failure', 'when', 'released', 'can', 'only', 'marvel', 'was', 'shown', 'smallNorth', 'Carolina', 'town', 'where', 'had', 'opportunity', 'see', 'am', 'glad', 'purchasedthis', 'blu-ray', 'edition', 'even', 'film', 'extremely', 'episodic', 'curiosity', 'Picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'make', 'worthwhile', 'hero', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'undergo', 'great', 'character', 'development', 'change', 'basically', 'same', 'moping', 'bloke', 'end', 'be', 'most', 'picture', 'One', 'wonders', 'why', 'three', 'female', 'leads', 'would', 'have', 'givenhim', 'time', 'day', 'will', 'watch', 'Egyptian', 'again', 'great', 'productionvalues', 'film', 'quality', 'blu', 'ray', 'wonderful', 'music', 'Alfred', 'Newman', 'Bernard', 'Hermann', 'number', 'actors', 'who', 'were', 'well', 'known', 'day', 'most', 'deservedly', 'so', 'please', 'Twilight', 'Time', 'money', 'issue', 'drop', 'commentaries', 'future', 'releases', ""'re"", 'going', 'exert', 'more', 'quality', 'control', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'people', 'limited', 'knowledge', 'insulting', 'intelligence', 'knowledge', 'cinema', 'history']",N/A

Undervalued at the time: disappointing boxoffice, negative reviews, not even Oscar-nominated for its lavish costumes and stunning art direction. Largely forgotten today, though perhaps this strikingly letterboxed DVD from Twilight Time will help to correct this deplorable situation. Despite its faults, at least ""The Egyptian"" is about something. (How many of today's comic-book-video-game spectacles are anything more than simplistic good-guys-vs-bad-guys fistfights?) It tells an involving story dealing with several major characters connected by complex relationships extending over a considerable length of time. These characters grapple with issues of substance resulting in resolutions (or the lack thereof) which often defy audience expectations. And the look of the movie! Its visual often jewel-like richness makes one bring forth words such as ""magnificence"" and ""beauty"" and ""splendor."" How many of today's movies offer anything comparable? (The Twilight Time DVD includes an audio commentary by two film historians who are especially adept in discussing how the width of CinemaScope presented problems in composing scenes.

However, their knowledge of film history sometimes seems a bit shaky since they confuse ""The Robe"" with ""Quo Vadis"" at several points in their narration, and they do talk a lot, even when pausing to allow one of the movie's characters to say aloud a line or two would have been both helpful and welcome.)

For those reasons critics were unfair to Purdom (and to the movie as a whole) and his career failed to thrive thereafter.  Actually, because the character is decidedly unheroic I think Purdom is well cast and has the most excellent English elocution, befitting his role as a physician.  Leon Shamroy's colour photography is stunningly rich, beautifully preserved on this issue, and goes some way to make the length and leisurely pace engrossing.  Happily so because there are some interesting characters popping in and out along the way.  Admittedly, apart from a death scene, the Simmons role wastes her talents but we have Peter Ustinov(!), Victor Mature (!) and, in a startling late-career role, stylish Gene Tierney.  The ancient Egypt setting is wonderfully evoked by the so often taken-for-granted art departments/costumers, and presents a nigh-vanished opulence that characterised productions of this genre.  The music score by maestro Alfred Newman plus Bernard Herrmann, no less(rushed in to assist because of delays on the shoot), is atmospheric and haunting.Recommended viewing for filling in cold winter afternoons.",4,A nostalgic wallow for lovers of widescreen spectaculars,1325030400,"12 28, 2011",2011,1404,"['anyone', 'interested', 'mega-budget', 'Hollywood', 'spectaculars', 'era', 'check', 'Blu-ray', 'Egyptian', 'project', 'was', 'cast', 'Brando', 'titular', 'lead', 'when', 'declined', 'had', 'make', 'do', 'Edmund', 'Purdom', 'who', 'had', 'male', 'model', 'looks', 'not', 'magnetism', 'reasons', 'critics', 'were', 'unfair', 'Purdom', 'movie', 'whole', 'career', 'failed', 'thrive', 'thereafter', 'Actually', 'character', 'decidedly', 'unheroic', 'think', 'Purdom', 'well', 'cast', 'most', 'excellent', 'English', 'elocution', 'befitting', 'role', 'physician', 'Leon', 'Shamroy', 'colour', 'photography', 'stunningly', 'rich', 'beautifully', 'preserved', 'issue', 'way', 'make', 'length', 'leisurely', 'pace', 'engrossing', 'Happily', 'so', 'are', 'interesting', 'characters', 'popping', 'way', 'Admittedly', 'apart', 'death', 'scene', 'Simmons', 'role', 'talents', 'have', 'Peter', 'Ustinov', 'Victor', 'Mature', 'startling', 'late-career', 'role', 'stylish', 'Gene', 'Tierney', 'ancient', 'Egypt', 'setting', 'wonderfully', 'evoked', 'so', 'often', 'taken-for-granted', 'art', 'departments/costumers', 'nigh-vanished', 'opulence', 'characterised', 'productions', 'genre', 'music', 'score', 'maestro', 'Alfred', 'Newman', 'Bernard', 'Herrmann', 'less', 'rushed', 'assist', 'delays', 'shoot', 'atmospheric', 'haunting.Recommended', 'viewing', 'filling', 'cold', 'winter', 'afternoons']",N/A

Gorey ""Behemoth""","[64, 70]","Not one of Michael Curtiz' best films, ""The Egyptian""  is seen here in a serviceable print (and in widescreen) but somehow this transfer doesn't ring any bells. The film itself is a static, sometimes involving historical epic, and the cast is good. Edmund Purdom is fine (despite bad reviews at the time) and he's capably supported by Gene Tierney, Victor Mature, Jean Simmons, and Michael Wilding. But Daryll Zanuck discovery (and mistress) Bella Darvi, as the evil temptress, is a liability. Zanuck wanted Marlene Dietrich to play the sensual siren who leads Purdom astray--and though she might have been too old at the time, she'd at least have delivered her lines with some conviction and style. The film is slow at times, but it picks up in the last act, and is often affecting, despite the limitations of the script and direction. Other reviewers have stated they couldn't turn off the Korean subtitles: I had the same trouble, and I found them distracting. Chances are this film will be released someday in a restored print.

It also happens to be extremely entertaining!Since I was a kid I was fascinated by ancient Egypt and this movie spares no expense on sets and costumes.....it's visually a feast for the eyes! If you're expecting lots of action scenes, you'll be disappointed. This is basically a melodrama which plays fast and loose with real historical events.The all star cast includes the beautiful Jean Simmons, the exotic Gene Tierney, the great Peter Ustinov (who steals every scene he's in), rugged Victor Mature, and handsome Edmund Purdom as ""The Egyptian"". The stars do the best that they can with a script that's only just adequate, but for the most part you'll be drawn in like I was and it won't make that much difference except in hindsight.The plot is really a love story with many twists and turns. Purdom was adopted as a baby, recused from a reed cradle in the Nile by a prominent doctor, only to find out later in life that he's of royal blood. What he does in between this time is what makes up the story.
