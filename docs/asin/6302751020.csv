331244,A6IKQOVUT6AI4,6302751020,Bonita L. Davis,"[8, 8]","Philip comes from a rigid, uptight family whose lives resemble that of a  rigid crane. Everyone keeps a happy face but no one is able to share what  is going on with them internally. Philip can no longer hide what he is from  his family. He decides to become open about his homosexuality to them. He  shares this with his lover who also keeps secrets.Philip's  announcement unravels a flood of pain, guilt and anger from his parents.  His mother believes some secrets should be kept hidden while his father  lingers in a pool of guilt. As an audience we get to see the hypocrisy of a  couple in a marriage that is a farce. We witness one young man's inability  to be in a relationship all because he wants his past hidden. The explosion  of feelings becomes a cartharsis that each character seeks but some of them  want to keep up the appearance of everything being okay.Enter the  world of gay bars, one night stands and illicit sex in a revealing movie  that forces people to be honest about themselves and their lives. Secrets  can kill. Secrets can hurt. The secrets in this movie will force you to  confront your own sexuality and ethics. Angus Macfayden does a splendid job  as the young man deciding to be honest while his mother (Eileen Atkins)  insists on carrying out the farce.

The son, Philip, has been living an openly gay life, but he has kept the truth from his parents--when he tells them his mother tells him that she wishes he had kept his mouth shut, and the father, Owen, is thrown into complete turmoil because he has been, denying his homosexual nature for years, and has been frequenting the Gay Porno movie house for who knows how long.  When Rose expresses her negative feelings about Philip not continuing to hide the truth he replies:  What would you have had me do--get married to a woman so that I can live a lie and look back on my life with regret in thirty years or so.  When he says this you can almost feel Owen's heart shatter--and you see the single tear trickle down his cheek.  The ending to this movie is left up in the air because some strings have been left dangling in that we are not really sure what is going to happen with Rose and Owen, but this is not a bad thing.The main point of this movie is that honesty is definitely the best policy even if the truth is hurtful to the other person--it is not worth the pain of hiding your true self from the people you love.",5,Great Movie,986256000,"04 3, 2001",2001,1316,"['wife', 'mother', 'Rose', 'one', 'line', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'priceless', 'life', 'punch', 'line', 'joke', 'husband', 'son', 'being', 'homosexual', 'son', 'Philip', 'been', 'living', 'openly', 'gay', 'life', 'kept', 'truth', 'parents', 'when', 'mother', 'had', 'kept', 'mouth', 'shut', 'father', 'Owen', 'thrown', 'complete', 'turmoil', 'been', 'denying', 'homosexual', 'nature', 'years', 'been', 'frequenting', 'Gay', 'Porno', 'movie', 'house', 'who', 'how', 'long', 'When', 'Rose', 'negative', 'feelings', 'Philip', 'not', 'continuing', 'hide', 'truth', 'What', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'do', 'get', 'married', 'woman', 'can', 'live', 'lie', 'look', 'back', 'life', 'regret', 'thirty', 'years', 'so', 'When', 'can', 'almost', 'feel', 'Owen', 'heart', 'shatter', 'see', 'single', 'tear', 'trickle', 'cheek', 'ending', 'movie', 'left', 'up', 'air', 'strings', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'dangling', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'Rose', 'Owen', 'not', 'bad', 'thing.The', 'main', 'point', 'movie', 'honesty', 'definitely', 'best', 'policy', 'even', 'truth', 'hurtful', 'other', 'person', 'not', 'worth', 'pain', 'hiding', 'true', 'self', 'people', 'love']",N/A
331247,A3LA8WLE0RQ4MB,6302751020,"D. Movahedpour ""doeadear""","[22, 22]","This film is based on David Leavitt's book of the same name, which takes place entirely in New York City. When the film version was made, with Leavitt's blessing, the scene is switched entirely to London. However, the core lesson of the film, about deep-seeded family secrets and how they erode the facade of a middle class family, stays in tact.Brian Cox and Eileen Atkins, two of Britain's best character actors, are incredibly good as the parents, Owen and Rose Benjamin. Owen is an Academic, and Rose is a Book Editor. The irony of Rose being in a profession where she needs an eye for detail is not lost as it contrasts to her own life. She has somehow managed to overlook that her husband is a closeted homosexual. In their generation, if a man felt or knew he was gay, he married, procreated, and carried on with life in most cases. The Benjamin's marriage could be like most long-term marriages without passion. Rose has had her affairs, mainly for the physical love she is missing from her husband. Owen wants desperately to explore the side of his life he has been repressing, but, so far, spends a good amount of his free time roaming gay cinemas.Adding to all of this is that their son, Phillip, a handsome book editor, very well-played by Angus MacFayden, is also gay. He is out to his friends, but not to his parents. He is madly in love with an American graphic artist, Elliott, played by Corey Parker. Phillip's belief that he has found the love of his life leads him to finally come out to his parents. But, he has no idea of the can of worms he has opened in the life and marriage of his parents. Rose would have been content to keep secrets indefinitely. However, Owen's son's admission opens the floodgates and propels Owen toward his new life.The film is still fairly faithful to the book, which I also recommend very highly. The acting is top-notch, as often seems the case in British-made films. The story is engrossing in its brevity, and strong in its lessons of honesty, betrayal, and the ultimate destruction of long-held secrets.",4,Well-acted tale of a family eroding from long-kept secrets,1034294400,"10 11, 2002",2002,2057,"['film', 'based', 'David', 'Leavitt', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'place', 'entirely', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'When', 'film', 'version', 'was', 'made', 'Leavitt', 'blessing', 'scene', 'switched', 'entirely', 'London', 'However', 'core', 'lesson', 'film', 'deep-seeded', 'family', 'secrets', 'how', 'erode', 'facade', 'middle', 'class', 'family', 'stays', 'tact.Brian', 'Cox', 'Eileen', 'Atkins', 'two', 'Britain', 'best', 'character', 'actors', 'are', 'incredibly', 'good', 'parents', 'Owen', 'Rose', 'Benjamin', 'Owen', 'Academic', 'Rose', 'Book', 'Editor', 'irony', 'Rose', 'being', 'profession', 'where', 'eye', 'detail', 'not', 'lost', 'own', 'life', 'somehow', 'managed', 'overlook', 'husband', 'closeted', 'homosexual', 'generation', 'man', 'felt', 'knew', 'was', 'gay', 'married', 'procreated', 'carried', 'life', 'most', 'cases', 'Benjamin', 'marriage', 'could', 'be', 'most', 'long-term', 'marriages', 'passion', 'Rose', 'had', 'affairs', 'mainly', 'physical', 'love', 'missing', 'husband', 'Owen', 'desperately', 'explore', 'side', 'life', 'been', 'repressing', 'so', 'far', 'good', 'amount', 'free', 'time', 'roaming', 'gay', 'cinemas.Adding', 'son', 'Phillip', 'handsome', 'book', 'editor', 'very', 'well-played', 'Angus', 'MacFayden', 'also', 'gay', 'out', 'friends', 'not', 'parents', 'madly', 'love', 'American', 'graphic', 'artist', 'Elliott', 'played', 'Corey', 'Parker', 'Phillip', 'belief', 'found', 'love', 'life', 'finally', 'come', 'out', 'parents', 'idea', 'can', 'worms', 'opened', 'life', 'marriage', 'parents', 'Rose', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'content', 'keep', 'secrets', 'indefinitely', 'However', 'Owen', 'son', 'admission', 'floodgates', 'propels', 'Owen', 'new', 'life.The', 'film', 'still', 'fairly', 'faithful', 'book', 'also', 'recommend', 'very', 'highly', 'acting', 'top-notch', 'often', 'case', 'British-made', 'films', 'story', 'engrossing', 'brevity', 'strong', 'lessons', 'honesty', 'betrayal', 'ultimate', 'destruction', 'long-held', 'secrets']",N/A

331249,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,6302751020,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[0, 0]","With a sharp story, tremendous irony, brilliantly low key performances, and elegant direction and cinematography, THE LOST LANGUAGE OF CRANES received tremendous acclaim when it debuted in 1992; a decade later it has lost but little of its original punch.Based on the notable novel by David Leavitt, CRANES offers the story of Philip (Angus Macfayden), an attractive young Englishman who has fallen in love with the wealthy and manipulative American Elliot (Corey Parker)--and on the basis of that love decides to inform his parents that he is gay.  But Philip's announce precipitates a crisis that he cannot imagine: his own father Owen (Brian Cox) is homosexual, a secret he has concealed from wife Rose (Eileen Atkins) since their marriage.  At the same time, Philip discovers the foundation of his love with Philip is considerably less stable than he thought, and suddenly all concerned in the story find their lives built on shifting sand.The performances are what make the film work, and while Mcfayden and Cox have the showier roles (and are excellent in them), it is really actress Eileen Atkins who emerges as the powerhouse performer in the complex role of a woman who has deliberately lived in denial--and who must now respond to a double-whammy that undercuts the very foundation of her existence.  Carefully controlled, Atkins delivers a flawless performance with incredible weight and realism.The flaw in the film is the script, which tends toward a certain clinical, slightly artificial awkwardness from time to time, and although the film offers many interesting visual metaphors, it ties them so loosely to the overall story that it is often difficult to know to what these metaphors refer.  Even so, THE LOST LANGUAGE OF CRANES offers a powerhouse punch in its message of the need for honesty lest one be trapped into a way of living that slowly and but inextricably destroys the opportunities of youth--and leaves one with the bitter realization that the effort of keeping the lie alive has left one with little more than the lie itself.

331250,A9I40WFF40R4,6302751020,"H. F. Corbin ""Foster Corbin""","[6, 6]","I have seen this film two or three times and find that it holds up well in spite of obvious flaws. Based on a novel by David Leavitt by the same name, the movie has a straight forward plot. A young gay Londoner Philip, in love with an American, struggles about how to tell his parents that he is gay. Since the viewer learns in the first few frames of the film that Philip's father is gay also, I'm not giving the plot away. The actors all do credible jobs although I would give an A to Brian Cox who plays the father. I cannot remember how the mother is drawn in the novel; but, unfortunately for her she generates little sympathy in the movie. While her position is not an easy one, it is almost impossible to care much for her since she handles all the family relevations so badly.The film could certainly have been better filmed, having a dark graininess in a lot of frames. While I understand-- or think I do--  perhaps the reticence of the Brits in filming bedroom scenes-- particularly with those of the same gender-- but did these men always make love in a dark place? Finally, maybe I'm just obtuse; but I would not have known, had I not read the blurb on the video box, that the ""rigid, angular movement of construction cranes becomes a metaphor for the destructive sexual hypocrisy that rips at one family,"" etc., etc.Having said all that, I still believe this is as honest a film as you will see on a family's dealing with the revelations of gay family members.",4,A Movie Well Worth Seeing More Than Once,1124841600,"08 24, 2005",2005,1473,"['have', 'seen', 'film', 'two', 'three', 'times', 'find', 'up', 'well', 'spite', 'obvious', 'flaws', 'Based', 'novel', 'David', 'Leavitt', 'same', 'name', 'movie', 'straight', 'forward', 'plot', 'young', 'gay', 'Londoner', 'Philip', 'love', 'American', 'how', 'tell', 'parents', 'gay', 'viewer', 'first', 'few', 'frames', 'film', 'Philip', 'father', 'gay', 'also', ""'m"", 'not', 'giving', 'plot', 'away', 'actors', 'do', 'credible', 'jobs', 'would', 'give', 'A', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'who', 'father', 'can', 'not', 'remember', 'how', 'mother', 'drawn', 'novel', 'unfortunately', 'little', 'sympathy', 'movie', 'position', 'not', 'easy', 'one', 'almost', 'impossible', 'care', 'much', 'family', 'relevations', 'so', 'badly.The', 'film', 'could', 'certainly', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'filmed', 'having', 'dark', 'graininess', 'lot', 'frames', 'understand', 'think', 'do', 'perhaps', 'reticence', 'Brits', 'filming', 'bedroom', 'scenes', 'particularly', 'same', 'gender', 'did', 'men', 'always', 'make', 'love', 'dark', 'place', 'Finally', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'just', 'obtuse', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'known', 'had', 'not', 'read', 'blurb', 'video', 'box', 'rigid', 'angular', 'movement', 'construction', 'cranes', 'metaphor', 'destructive', 'sexual', 'hypocrisy', 'one', 'family', 'etc.', 'etc.Having', 'said', 'still', 'believe', 'as', 'honest', 'film', 'will', 'see', 'family', 'dealing', 'revelations', 'gay', 'family', 'members']",N/A
331251,AQQFI7YHMRL7S,6302751020,James Morris,"[6, 6]","The film version of the Lost Language of Cranes is a triumph for its main stars, Brian Cox and Eileen Atkins.  It was my first exposure to the work of either, and this film is the root of my immense admiration of their talents.There has always been some confusion concerning the allegory of the title.  In the David Leavitt novel, the narrative is supported by an involved subplot, a tale concerning an ""abandoned"" child.  I agree with the reviewer who complained that the allegory is unfortunately not explained very well in the film, and I had to re-read the book to refresh my understanding of the meaning of the title.  In the book, far more detail is devoted to the story of this child, who has been neglected by his drug addicted mother and left to fend for himself in a playpen, without the comfort of human bonding or affection.  After spending his first year in the shadow of a giant crane on a construction site outside his window, he compensates for his lack of human companionship by ""bonding"" with the giant crane, and eventually constructs his own ""language"" based on its movements, mimicking the crane to express joy, love or affection.  However, since he is unable to communicate his feelings outside of the invented language, its exact details and meaning are lost forever.The story of the Crane Child parallels the failed relationship of Owen and Rose (Cox and Atkins), who long ago have lost the ability to communicate their needs and wants to each other, each sharing only those domestic details that they deem important.  The allegory of the child ""communicating"" with his crane-language is much more fully threshed out in the novel, and the lack of detail in the film makes this portion of the story confusing; the overall effect is that the details concerning the ""Crane Child"" seem rather forced, and weaken rather than strengthen the narrative.However, understanding the title is not essential to the main drama.  The acting is very good on the part of each of the cast members, and the story is strong enough to survive without a clearer explanation of the title.  Although Eileen Atkins has been deservedly praised as the strongest performer, Brian Cox gives a particularly nuanced reading as the closeted father, guarding the secret of his sexuality throughout a troubled marriage, until he fairly explodes in frustration and loneliness.  A key scene depicting Owen's reaction to his son's coming out is particularly heartfelt, and a highly effective piece of acting.  The film suffers not at all from the change of venue from New York to London; I recall that the American telecast was prefaced by a commentary by Mr. Leavitt, who stated that the location was changed to England simply because it was produced and financed by the BBC.The DVD release of Lost Language of Cranes is long overdue, and a welcome addition to my video library.  I only wish that CBS Fox would just see fit to release a DVD edition of the Boys in the Band, another gay classic they've been sitting on for way too many years.",4,"Very Well Done Indeed, And Long Overdue on DVD",1181001600,"06 5, 2007",2007,3029,"['film', 'version', 'Lost', 'Language', 'Cranes', 'triumph', 'main', 'stars', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'Eileen', 'Atkins', 'was', 'first', 'exposure', 'work', 'film', 'root', 'immense', 'admiration', 'talents.There', 'always', 'been', 'confusion', 'concerning', 'allegory', 'title', 'David', 'Leavitt', 'novel', 'narrative', 'supported', 'involved', 'subplot', 'tale', 'concerning', 'abandoned', 'child', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'who', 'complained', 'allegory', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'explained', 'very', 'well', 'film', 'had', 're-read', 'book', 'refresh', 'understanding', 'meaning', 'title', 'book', 'far', 'more', 'detail', 'devoted', 'story', 'child', 'who', 'been', 'neglected', 'drug', 'addicted', 'mother', 'left', 'fend', 'playpen', 'comfort', 'human', 'bonding', 'affection', 'spending', 'first', 'year', 'shadow', 'giant', 'crane', 'construction', 'site', 'window', 'lack', 'human', 'companionship', 'bonding', 'giant', 'crane', 'eventually', 'own', 'language', 'based', 'movements', 'mimicking', 'crane', 'express', 'joy', 'love', 'affection', 'However', 'unable', 'communicate', 'feelings', 'invented', 'language', 'exact', 'details', 'meaning', 'are', 'lost', 'forever.The', 'story', 'Crane', 'Child', 'failed', 'relationship', 'Owen', 'Rose', 'Cox', 'Atkins', 'who', 'long', 'ago', 'have', 'lost', 'ability', 'communicate', 'needs', 'other', 'sharing', 'only', 'domestic', 'details', 'deem', 'important', 'allegory', 'child', 'communicating', 'crane-language', 'much', 'more', 'fully', 'threshed', 'out', 'novel', 'lack', 'detail', 'film', 'portion', 'story', 'confusing', 'overall', 'effect', 'details', 'concerning', 'Crane', 'Child', 'seem', 'rather', 'forced', 'rather', 'strengthen', 'narrative.However', 'understanding', 'title', 'not', 'essential', 'main', 'drama', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'part', 'cast', 'members', 'story', 'strong', 'enough', 'survive', 'clearer', 'explanation', 'title', 'Eileen', 'Atkins', 'been', 'deservedly', 'praised', 'strongest', 'performer', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'particularly', 'nuanced', 'reading', 'closeted', 'father', 'guarding', 'secret', 'sexuality', 'troubled', 'marriage', 'fairly', 'frustration', 'loneliness', 'key', 'scene', 'depicting', 'Owen', 'reaction', 'son', 'coming', 'out', 'particularly', 'heartfelt', 'highly', 'effective', 'piece', 'acting', 'film', 'suffers', 'not', 'change', 'venue', 'New', 'York', 'London', 'recall', 'American', 'telecast', 'was', 'prefaced', 'commentary', 'Mr.', 'Leavitt', 'who', 'stated', 'location', 'was', 'changed', 'England', 'simply', 'was', 'produced', 'financed', 'BBC.The', 'DVD', 'release', 'Lost', 'Language', 'Cranes', 'long', 'overdue', 'welcome', 'addition', 'video', 'library', 'only', 'wish', 'CBS', 'Fox', 'would', 'just', 'see', 'fit', 'release', 'DVD', 'edition', 'Boys', 'Band', 'gay', ""'ve"", 'been', 'sitting', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'years']",N/A

""The Lost Language of Cranes"" is a most welcomed exception to the ""Gay-themed"" Rule.Based on the honesty (or lack there of) of family members towards each other, the secrets start unlocking when the son (Angus Macfadyn) announces to his parents that he's Gay, which starts a ripple effect touching both Mom and Dad who have secrets themselves.  Mom has been having a few sexual affairs and has turned a blind eye to Dad's obvious secret... He's actively Gay and used to spending his Sundays doing the ""sleaze thing"" at local Porn Theaters.There are some tough decisions to be made for each of them and watching that process is rivoting.I am so pleased to watch a Gay-themed Film that deals with real-life situations that I have encouraged all my friends to watch this this fantastic portrayal of a slightly off-center, average family.

Young and closeted, I was flipping through the stations one night and caught a glimpse of what I thought was two men in bed.  With my parents gone to bed, I turned the sound down and flipped back to the channel.  This movie is what was playing.  Imagine the effects it had on a boy of my age at that time.  I was elated to learn that it was based on a novel by David Leavitt which has long been a favorite on my bookshelf now.The novel and movie focus on a [...] son, Philip, who comes out to his parents Owen (Brian Cox) and Rose (Eileen Atkins). The parents surprisingly take Phillip's coming out very badly. And Owen, we learn, has more in common with his son than anyone would like to think about. It turns out that Owen, the father, is also [...]. Owen who lives in different, more conservative and maybe old fashioned living, lives in existential fear of being exposed.  Rose thinks he is out for a walk, when he is actually visiting porn theaters. Rose knows all along, but practices the old time saying, ""what we don't know, doesn't hurt us."" The coming out of Philip turns out as a revealing of the life of lies and deceit that Rose and Owen had lived.Of course there is a love interest for Phillip, and Owen's secret is exposed when he invites another young man to dinner with the intent of setting up his son on a date.  Rose sees through Owen's own lust for the man and a chilling argument ensues in which Owen leaves the house and the viewer is left with a quiet scene of Rose just sitting at home, alone and knitting.  Nothing more.A sub plot follows young twin girls who have developed their own private language, outside of which they cannot communicate. It's a brilliant metaphor for how [...] people build understanding often through their own isolated experiences, and build language and knowledge that is often misunderstood, threatened and indeed fragile when it comes into contact with the wider world.Years ago, this movie sent chills up my young spine, and the book proved to be life-long inspiring.

331257,ADK5CSMBXHIL8,6302751020,"T. Halkin ""Tim""","[7, 7]","The film offers two metaphors for the suppression of expression - young twins, who have never been taught an established language, and hence create one of their own; and a neglected child, who's only company is the view it has of a building site with several large cranes from the window:  the child begins to imitate the cranes' movements and noises in an attempt to communicate with them.  No fear - the symbolism is kept to a minimum.At the film's core, are three people, all of whom have been suppressing their real feelings ( their real selves) from the others for fear of change - for fear of disrupting the balance of their existence.  This lack of expressing themselves in language, causes them to create their own ""language of cranes"".They're terrified that the truth will rip apart the world as they know it, which it does.  The viewer is left with their loose ends, wondering if honesty really was the best.  Everything they feared about honesty comes to pass.  The family is torn apart without a way back.  The mother is left feeling like the punch line of a bad joke and the father will be left with 30 years of remorse and guilt.  But they're free.  They're alive and free - and they still have time to take advantage of their second chance at life.There are no action scenes here, but this film is more suspenseful than a thriller.  If you have ever kept a secret from someone you loved - beware - this film might make you feel very uncomfortable.Bottom line:  a wonderful script, excellent acting and well directed on a small budget.  A must see (not just for homosexuals).",5,Honesty has a language of its own,993945600,"07 1, 2001",2001,1589,"['film', 'two', 'metaphors', 'suppression', 'expression', 'young', 'twins', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'taught', 'established', 'language', 'hence', 'create', 'one', 'own', 'neglected', 'child', 'who', 'only', 'company', 'view', 'building', 'site', 'several', 'large', 'cranes', 'window', 'child', 'imitate', 'cranes', 'movements', 'noises', 'attempt', 'communicate', 'fear', 'symbolism', 'kept', 'minimum.At', 'film', 'core', 'are', 'three', 'people', 'whom', 'have', 'been', 'suppressing', 'real', 'feelings', 'real', 'selves', 'others', 'fear', 'change', 'fear', 'disrupting', 'balance', 'existence', 'lack', 'expressing', 'language', 'create', 'own', 'language', 'cranes', '.They', ""'re"", 'terrified', 'truth', 'will', 'rip', 'apart', 'world', 'know', 'viewer', 'left', 'loose', 'ends', 'wondering', 'honesty', 'really', 'was', 'best', 'Everything', 'feared', 'honesty', 'pass', 'family', 'torn', 'apart', 'way', 'back', 'mother', 'left', 'feeling', 'punch', 'line', 'bad', 'joke', 'father', 'will', 'be', 'left', '30', 'years', 'remorse', 'guilt', ""'re"", 'free', ""'re"", 'alive', 'free', 'still', 'have', 'time', 'take', 'advantage', 'second', 'chance', 'are', 'action', 'here', 'film', 'more', 'suspenseful', 'thriller', 'have', 'ever', 'kept', 'secret', 'someone', 'loved', 'beware', 'film', 'might', 'make', 'feel', 'very', 'uncomfortable.Bottom', 'line', 'wonderful', 'script', 'excellent', 'acting', 'well', 'directed', 'small', 'budget', 'must', 'see', 'not', 'just', 'homosexuals']",N/A
