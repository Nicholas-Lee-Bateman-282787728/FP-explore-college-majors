854775,A1C0NMCONVFVF4,B0003JANTG,Chloe,"[0, 0]","I have waited years for Prisoner (aka Prisoner: Cell Block H) to get a re-release on either VHS or DVD (even better!) ever since I discovered the video set (volumes 1-6) containing two episodes each had gone out of print through MPI (their previous primary distributor)  almost 10 years ago.  What a disappointment.  I had frantically searched for the set, but to no avail.Now I am so pleased that Prisoner Cell Block H is out on DVD & that it's available in the states.  I have followed the show via tapes my Friend over in the UK has sent, so I got to see The Joan Freguson episodes.  For many American fans that is a rarity.  I was able to view the tapes as I have a multi-region VCR.  Unfortunately PAL Tapes aren't compatible with our machines so that contraption was like gold to me.Now other american fans can see just how nasty & despicable The Freak was.  I loved Bea & was sad to see her go.  She had been in the series since the show's inception.  I only wish this DVD contained the very first episode to show others how it all began.Some of the very finest episodes I wish were included in this set would be the Kate Peterson ones.  The episode where she really flipped & tried to strangle Judy Bryant was chilling.  Her descent into madness was unnerving!!  Definitely among the best storylines!  And the episodes where a Prison Doctor who abhors prostitutes takes a fancy to Chrissie Latham & soon discovers through one of the warders that she had been inside for being on the game, & so soon after she's released again, Dr. David arranges a romantic interlude at a secluded Cottage where he tries to kill her.  However, the episodes provided here were great ones as well!  There are so many good plots throughout the course of the series.  It was an excellent ensemble cast.  I also enjoyed Jane Clifton as Margo, & the actress who played Marie Winters. They were a scream & always made me laugh.  They were great!  Their characters were both villains & at one point or another, each schemed to grab the title of Top Dog at Wentworth from Bea.  To me, Val Lehman as Bea was the only Top Dog.  I am very fond of the other actresses as well, but Bea called the shots in my book.The series had been frank in it's controversial storylines & has won many awards in Australia for it's contribution to Aussie Television.  Even over here the soap was a worthy contender for Charlie's Angels.I love the packaging of the DVD.  The sound is crisp & the colors sharp.  Extras contain interviews with Val Lehman (Bea Smith), & Anne Phelan (Myra Desmond).10 hours isn't enough, we NEED MORE PRISONER!!  Hopefully this 25th anniversary issue will sell well & this groundbreaking series will at long last get the recognition here it deserves.  This series is a candid depiction of good drama.  It's engrossing & in some ways very realistic.The Women are not Barbie Cut-outs, they are talented actresses portraying fleshy, passionate characters who bond & look out for each other while on the inside they see that they all aren't really all that different.  Some have been given the business by the system & fight to prove they're human & have made mistakes.  Very clever, engrossing & poignant.Bea, Dor & Lizzie are family.  They are there for each other & look out for one another.  It's heartwarming at times.  Lizzie is like everyone's Grandmother.  She likes a nip every chance she gets, & has the wildest cackle, but a heart of gold, you can't help but love her.  And I for one loved Patsy King as the Governor.  Erica Davidson was alright!  And Meg, always had a shoulder for the Prisoners & was compassionate oftentimes & genuinely enjoyed helping them & rehabilitating them.I hope Grundy & A&E; are listening!!An imitator, Dangerous Women was broadcast here in the early 1990's, also produced by Reg Grundy, but failed to generate large numbers in the ratings & alas was cancelled after one or two seasons.  Incidentally, the UK has a similar soap which has been running since 1999, entitled Bad Girls.  In all fairness, is a good show, but is no match for Prisoner.Hopefully some DVD's of that will come out at some point if Prisoner rakes in the sales.  Glad to see other fans out there.  Hope you're enjoying your DVD as much as I am.  May this be the first of many future releases (preferably season sets!).Happy Anniversary Prisoner!  You're THE BEST!  5 Stars!!!

854781,A2N4PJBSMMSULP,B0003JANTG,"lady victoria ""vickl1""","[3, 3]","I bought this DVD at a much lesser price because it was taking a risk.  I had only seen snatches of the show over the summer (it was going off when I settled down to watch reruns of Peyton Place in the afternoon), and while I knew something of what it was about, I didn't have a clear picture.  I watched this DVD slowly at first; then I really got into it.  Of course it was orginally a night time show over here in the U.S.  I don't believe they scheduled shows with bad language on any earlier than 10pm in those days, and this one dealt with violence and lesbians.  TV is too explicit about things like that today.  This show, however, was not.  The subject was handled verbally more than physically, the way I think it should be handled.  Any kind of initimate sexual relationship is personal and should be left to a viewer's imagination.  After all, I enjoy Rhett Butler's taking Scarlett upstairs in Gone With the Wind and her facial expression the next morning than I do explicit sex scenes.Lesbianism didn't play such a big role in this DVD as I thought it would.  Kath Maxwell sums up the main theme of the series in one of the later episodes:  survival.  The women, prisoners and staff, guilty and innocent, must survive riots, fights and their own personal demons.  I had ambivalent attitudes towards many of the prisoners, especially Bea Smith.  The episode of her departure with Lizzie screaming after her is heart-wrenching, even though I know Bea could be pretty bad herself in the series.  What is very surprising is that, in spite of the survival theme, the women care about each other.  The words ""love"" and ""mate"" are used as often as the dirty words.  Older prisoners Lizzie and Ettie develop a maternal attitude toward younger prisoners.  Myra Desmond is capable of downright heroism, and prisoners and officers alike try to help inmate Rita Conners deal with terminal cancer.  It is humanity mixed in with the brutality, as you might find in other prison or war movies, but here it is somehow special.  It makes me wonder if I shouldn't think twice about prison inmates.  I have recently discovered the series' website and hope they will have more information on the characters.  I don't know what a majority of the prisoners were charged with!

854782,A2O55C9VKB2QY5,B0003JANTG,Michael Favareille,"[50, 57]","I did some research on a number of websites devoted to this show. For those who are not familiar, Prisoner: Cell Block H was a continuing serialized show that ran for 8 years in Australia and was very popular in Britain as well. In the US, it had its greatest success when it ran on Tuesday evenings at 8 PM on KTLA-5, Los Angeles, between 1980-1982(and beating Happy Days in the Neilsen ratings in the LA market). This was not a show for the family to watch as it was quite frank(including what may have been the first depiction of lesbianism on US TV).Apparently, this will be a repackaging of a Best-Of DVD set that is currently available in Britain(and in Australia as well--2 other collections are also available in Australia.) 12 hour-long episodes(US syndication cut them to 30 minutes except for the KTLA airings) from throughout the shows comprise the DVD set, along with a couple of interviews(one of which is with Bea, who was one of the major characters on the show). Personally, I would rather see this released as season sets(or do like MPI does with Dark Shadows, release 40 half-hour shows per DVD set in order to continue the story). Being this is a serialized show, watching episodes out of sequence and without the full stories detract from the entertainment value. (And I feel maybe bring new fans since this show is a bit obscure to most people.)

It had strong colorful characters, and the prison setting made for some interesting and unusual storylines.  Though some of the cultural nuances may have been missed, for the most part the American audience probably had no major problems following along.692 episodes were produced during the series run from 1979 through 1986.  With that many episodes, this retrospective 25th Anniversary collection of 12 programs, can only give the faintest taste of what the series was like.  Continuity is impossible, and being able to put things into some kind of context is a rather difficult as well.  Cell Block H was a gritty program, but this collection is pretty much only for its fans.

854788,A2ASIT0JYIGHTA,B0003JANTG,William,"[20, 20]","I was grateful when Prisoner came out on DVD in Australia back in 2001, but was annoyed when it was only selected episodes handpicked as 'best of episodes' in the minds of the TV distributor.  This Prisoner DVD 3-set has since been released in USA And UK and while it is great for all of us to have, I am confused why certain episodes were selected when there are much, much better ones to pick (ie. ones with Vera Bennett).  Really, out of 692 episodes, they could have done a better job.  Better than nothing though.Prisoner ruled Australian TV from 1979 to 1986 and many consider its best years to be 1980 to 1982.  I had no idea it was shown on American TV until I read about it here on Amazon.  Just a shame that America only got to see one or two seasons before it was pulled in favour of Mash re-runs.Anyway, with the popularity of DVDs, there is no excuse why the complete Prisoner seasons couldn't be released on DVD beginning with Season 1 from 1979 starring Kerry Armstrong, Peta Topano and Val Leahman (Bea Smith). Even better, 1979 covered alot of Vera Bennett.  Unfortunately, the current DVD (Best Of) only shows one episode of Vera and focusses on to many episodes of Joan Fergusion.In Australia, they have since released another installment of Prisoner DVD's although once again are more of those  'best of' episodes. These new DVD's are very expensive compared to the first installment so I am yet to get them.I doubt we will ever get complete seasons released as there are simply too many episodes.
