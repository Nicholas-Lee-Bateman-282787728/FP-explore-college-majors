Billy Mitchell was the Army/Air Force General who in the 1920's; said, and showed, that aircraft bombers could sink battleships.  He also said,(under oath), in the 1920's that the Japanese could launch a Sunday morning aircraft carrier attack on Pearl Harbor, and devestate the USA Army and Navy units stationed there.  ENDING SPOILER-Gen. Mitchell was court martialed and forced to resign his commission more for the way he said what he did, than for what he had to say.  Seeing this film with it's great cast, especially Gary Cooper in the title role, makes me think about what might have been IF Gen. Mitchell been a little more tactful, or had his higher ranking officers been a little more willing to listen to him.  Citizen Billy Mitchell died in the 1930's, so he was not alive in 1941.

206864,A1345VRK5MYG7,6300208060,James L.,"[3, 3]","Gary Cooper stars as a General advocating the need for developing the Air Force following WWI, at a time when the Army and Navy did not believe it would be useful.  His insistence on its usefulness leads to a demotion when he goes against orders, and later on, when he makes accusatory statements about the military, he is brought to trial for court martial.  The fact that this is a true story certainly lends interest to it, but the slowness of the pacing offsets that.  Cooper has a few good moments as the stubborn, heroic general who puts his career on the line to speak the truth and try to make changes, but to be honest, I did not find his performance to be a complete success.  He's inconsistent and his laid back style doesn't always work.  The supporting cast does better, with Rod Steiger as one of the prosecutors adding a lot of spark, and Ralph Bellamy relishing his role as Cooper's defender.  It's fun to watch a number of up-and-coming young stars such as Elizabeth Montgomery (in a critical role), Jack Lord, Darren MacGavin, and Peter Graves.

And yet Elizabeth Montgomery's large screen appearances can be counted on the fingers of one hand.  What happened?She is simply sublime in this, her very first movie role (though some say she appears in THEY WERE EXPENDABLE in the short bit where Robert Montgomery remembers his family back at home).  She made a big impression on moviegoers, and Otto Preminger took every care to make her look luscious, designing her period clothes with care and giving her many closeups, some of them quite extraneous to his story of a man on trial for vilifying the Armed Services with his rash Cassandra-like predictions of doom for the Air Force.  People must have wondered what was Elizabeth Montgomery's character even doing in the picture?  It is certainly dragged in from left field.  And yet she was a welcome attraction in this movie.  That one pink and orange Schiaparelli concoction Preminger dressed her in made her look like a tall, cool parfait.  And yet what happened after this movie?  Nothing--not another movie for seven years -- not until BEACH PARTY (1963) where she's only in the movie for like twenty seconds!  It's totally unfair.It is said by those in the know that Elizabeth was in line to play the parts Preminger was planning for her to take in his upcoming films, BONJOUR TRISTESSE and Shaw's SAINT JOAN.  She wiuld have been perfect in both, of course.  Was it that she wouldn;t go along with his notorious casting couch system and that's why she lost both parts to the unbalanced and yet quite talented Iowan Jean Seberg?  And she was relegated to appearing on TV dramas including her own father's vanity showcase?  Poor Miss Montgomery married the much older Gig Young and tried to get away from her golden trap, and yet she never could until she unleashed Gig Young (who had been a bosom buddy of her Dad's) and stopped playing Daddy's little girl, much like Jane Fonda had to do later on in the 1960s.  Anyway let this wonderful film stand in as a testament of a career that took a much different direction.  But it could have been Elizabeth Montgomery who played all the parts that say, Shirley Jones or Natalie Wood later did.  She was just squelched.",5,Elizabeth Montgomery on DVD,1117497600,"05 31, 2005",2005,2591,"['one', 'miost', 'beautiful', 'Hollywood', 'actresses', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'beloved', 'thanks', 'largely', 'years', 'playing', 'Samantha', 'BEWITCHED', 'was', 'Hollywood', 'royalty', 'daughter', 'dashing', 'patriot', 'Robert', 'Montgomery', 'man', 'huge', 'influence', 'movie', 'world', 'actor', 'light', 'comedy', 'who', 'matured', 'War', 'years', 'serious', 'actor', 'then', 'director', 'producer', 'enormous', 'resources', 'yet', 'Elizabeth', 'Montgomery', 'large', 'screen', 'appearances', 'can', 'be', 'counted', 'fingers', 'one', 'hand', 'What', 'happened', 'simply', 'sublime', 'very', 'first', 'movie', 'role', 'say', 'THEY', 'WERE', 'EXPENDABLE', 'short', 'bit', 'where', 'Robert', 'Montgomery', 'family', 'back', 'home', 'made', 'big', 'impression', 'moviegoers', 'Otto', 'Preminger', 'took', 'care', 'make', 'look', 'luscious', 'designing', 'period', 'clothes', 'care', 'giving', 'many', 'closeups', 'quite', 'extraneous', 'story', 'man', 'trial', 'vilifying', 'Armed', 'Services', 'rash', 'Cassandra-like', 'predictions', 'doom', 'Air', 'Force', 'People', 'must', 'have', 'wondered', 'what', 'was', 'Elizabeth', 'Montgomery', 'character', 'even', 'doing', 'picture', 'certainly', 'dragged', 'left', 'field', 'yet', 'was', 'welcome', 'attraction', 'movie', 'one', 'pink', 'orange', 'Schiaparelli', 'concoction', 'Preminger', 'dressed', 'made', 'look', 'tall', 'cool', 'parfait', 'yet', 'what', 'happened', 'movie', 'Nothing', 'not', 'movie', 'seven', 'years', 'not', 'BEACH', 'PARTY', '1963', 'where', 'only', 'movie', 'twenty', 'seconds', 'totally', 'unfair.It', 'said', 'know', 'Elizabeth', 'was', 'line', 'play', 'parts', 'Preminger', 'was', 'planning', 'take', 'upcoming', 'films', 'BONJOUR', 'TRISTESSE', 'Shaw', 'SAINT', 'JOAN', 'have', 'been', 'perfect', 'course', 'Was', 'wouldn', 'go', 'along', 'notorious', 'casting', 'couch', 'system', 'why', 'lost', 'parts', 'unbalanced', 'yet', 'quite', 'talented', 'Iowan', 'Jean', 'Seberg', 'was', 'relegated', 'appearing', 'TV', 'dramas', 'including', 'own', 'father', 'vanity', 'showcase', 'Poor', 'Miss', 'Montgomery', 'married', 'much', 'older', 'Gig', 'Young', 'tried', 'get', 'away', 'golden', 'trap', 'yet', 'never', 'could', 'unleashed', 'Gig', 'Young', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'bosom', 'buddy', 'Dad', 'stopped', 'playing', 'Daddy', 'little', 'girl', 'much', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'had', 'do', 'later', '1960s', 'Anyway', 'let', 'wonderful', 'film', 'stand', 'testament', 'career', 'took', 'much', 'different', 'direction', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Elizabeth', 'Montgomery', 'who', 'played', 'parts', 'say', 'Shirley', 'Jones', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'later', 'did', 'was', 'just', 'squelched']",Court Martial of Billy Mitchell VHS

206872,A30Q8X8B1S3GGT,6300208060,"Mark Savary ""moon_city""","[24, 29]","""The Court Matrial of Billy Mitchell"" is a gem, albeit not a precious one.Gary Cooper is in fine form given the constraints of the material he has to work with. Charles Bickford is perfect as General Guthrie, Ralph Bellamy steals his scenes, and Rod Steiger rules his eight to ten minutes of screen time. Here we also have three future stars of television, who round out the supporting cast; Jack Lord, Elizabeth Montgomery, and a cameo for Peter Graves.The story of the almost prescient Mitchell, who forsaw the then-fanciful advancements in air power, perfectly captures the views of the Army and Navy at the time; that airplanes were nothing more than unreliable toys.Mitchell, always a crusader for air power, is muzzled and ignored by the military establishment. Only when the Navy airship Shennedoah is lost due to shortsighted Navy orders does Mitchell break with the Army and make public statements accusing the Army and Navy command of negligence. Inviting his own courtmartial in order to finally have his say, Mitchell is given the opportunity to martyr himself in the name of military airmen everywhere.If anything holds the film back, it would have to be the combination of the script and the oddly detached direction of Otto Preminger. Neither serves the material well, but the film is compelling anyway. The film bogs down a bit as it transmutes from historical action bio into a courtroom drama, but the legend of Mitchell is enough to carry the film over the rough spots, and keep the viewer watching.The packaging of the DVD says that the film is in standard (or pan n' scan) format, but the disc is actually (and thankfully), in widescreen. The widescreen framing is not perfect, but close enough for satisfaction. The color is a bit ""washed out"", and the sets are clearly painted in a color scheme meant for black and white film. This combination makes the colors a bit garish at times, but for the age of the film, it looks pretty good overall barring a full-on restoration.Of special note is the final set piece, the warehouse that served as location for Mitchell's trial. The set is surprisingly true to the photos taken of the actual location during the real life trial.",3,"Flies High, But Not Supersonic...",1071792000,"12 19, 2003",2003,2194,"['Court', 'Matrial', 'Billy', 'Mitchell', 'gem', 'not', 'precious', 'one.Gary', 'Cooper', 'fine', 'form', 'given', 'constraints', 'material', 'work', 'Charles', 'Bickford', 'perfect', 'General', 'Guthrie', 'Ralph', 'Bellamy', 'scenes', 'Rod', 'Steiger', 'rules', 'eight', 'ten', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', 'Here', 'also', 'have', 'three', 'future', 'stars', 'television', 'who', 'round', 'out', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Jack', 'Lord', 'Elizabeth', 'Montgomery', 'cameo', 'Peter', 'Graves.The', 'story', 'almost', 'prescient', 'Mitchell', 'who', 'forsaw', 'then-fanciful', 'advancements', 'air', 'power', 'perfectly', 'views', 'Army', 'Navy', 'time', 'airplanes', 'were', 'nothing', 'more', 'unreliable', 'toys.Mitchell', 'always', 'crusader', 'air', 'power', 'muzzled', 'ignored', 'military', 'establishment', 'Only', 'when', 'Navy', 'airship', 'Shennedoah', 'lost', 'due', 'shortsighted', 'Navy', 'orders', 'Mitchell', 'break', 'Army', 'make', 'public', 'statements', 'accusing', 'Army', 'Navy', 'command', 'negligence', 'Inviting', 'own', 'courtmartial', 'order', 'finally', 'have', 'say', 'Mitchell', 'given', 'opportunity', 'martyr', 'name', 'military', 'airmen', 'everywhere.If', 'anything', 'film', 'back', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'combination', 'script', 'oddly', 'detached', 'direction', 'Otto', 'Preminger', 'material', 'well', 'film', 'compelling', 'anyway', 'film', 'bogs', 'down', 'bit', 'historical', 'action', 'bio', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'legend', 'Mitchell', 'enough', 'carry', 'film', 'rough', 'spots', 'keep', 'viewer', 'watching.The', 'packaging', 'DVD', 'film', 'standard', 'pan', 'n', 'scan', 'format', 'disc', 'actually', 'thankfully', 'widescreen', 'widescreen', 'framing', 'not', 'perfect', 'close', 'enough', 'satisfaction', 'color', 'bit', 'washed', 'out', 'sets', 'are', 'clearly', 'painted', 'color', 'scheme', 'meant', 'black', 'white', 'film', 'combination', 'colors', 'bit', 'garish', 'times', 'age', 'film', 'pretty', 'good', 'overall', 'barring', 'full-on', 'restoration.Of', 'special', 'note', 'final', 'set', 'piece', 'warehouse', 'served', 'location', 'Mitchell', 'trial', 'set', 'surprisingly', 'true', 'photos', 'taken', 'actual', 'location', 'real', 'life', 'trial']",Court Martial of Billy Mitchell VHS

In THE COURT MARTIAL OF BILLY MITCHELL, director Otto Preminger dramatizes the dilemma of Billy Mitchell, who had to struggle with his sense of duty that ran counter to a conscience that refused to let his fellow airmen die in preventable air crashes.  Gary Cooper as Billy Mitchell was 54 when he made this film and his true life weariness and evident age did not detract from a performance that did not differ materially from the laid back roles he had earlier showed as Lou Gehrig and Alvin York.  As disgraced Colonel Billy Mitchell, Cooper uses his stone face and immense dignity that allows him to maintain his purpose while others lose theirs in the heat of the moment.  Colonel Mitchell has seen too many trusted comrades die when he and they knew that their deaths were caused by the criminal negligence of his military superiors. Mitchell does the unthinkable.  He goes public with his accusations and is court martialed.The first half sets up this courtroom drama with sterling performances by Jack Lord, Elizabeth Montgomery, and Darren McGavin.  As his friends die, you can sense that Mitchell's iron-bound duty not to break the chain of command is beginning to rust.  The dramatic center of the first half is internal, as Cooper portrays a man who knows what he wants to do but is forbidden to do.  The second half is the trial itself.  Although Cooper has to share center stage with Charles Bickford as the presiding judge and a young and arrogant Rod Steiger as the prosecuting attorney, Cooper manages a rare balancing act.  He successfully keeps the military jury's and the audience's attention on the need for aviation reform while not allowing the film to sink into a 'message' movie, that might otherwise have been literally true but less interesting.  One of the reasons that enabled Cooper to be the megastar that he was was his ability to say commonsense things in a straightforward way that never let the audience forget that a fully-fleshed character truly believed in the veracity of his words.  No matter how hard Steiger tries to make Cooper look foolish on the witness stand, it is Steiger--and by implication the army--that was foolish for not heeding Colonel Mitchell's many warnings about the need to upgrade the American air force.  The movie ends rather abruptly with no hint that Mitchell's foresight would one day be vindicated.  And if the audience is denied the pleasure of seeing Colonel Mitchell vindicated, then, by contrast, the integrity of a man who had only his gut feelings to guide him stamps him as the rarest of men: one who has strong convictions and is unafraid to place his job and character on the line to express them.",4,Billy's Universal Choice: Obedience or Integrity,1059004800,"07 24, 2003",2003,2945,"['events', 'December', '7', '1941', 'may', 'have', 'come', 'total', 'surprise', 'nearly', 'Americans', 'not', 'Billy', 'Mitchell', 'who', 'years', 'earlier', 'had', 'predicted', 'astonishing', 'accuracy', 'details', 'attack', 'would', 'cripple', 'United', 'States', 'naval', 'powers', 'more', 'two', 'years', 'THE', 'COURT', 'MARTIAL', 'OF', 'BILLY', 'MITCHELL', 'director', 'Otto', 'Preminger', 'dilemma', 'Billy', 'Mitchell', 'who', 'had', 'struggle', 'sense', 'duty', 'ran', 'counter', 'conscience', 'refused', 'let', 'fellow', 'airmen', 'die', 'preventable', 'air', 'crashes', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'Billy', 'Mitchell', 'was', '54', 'when', 'made', 'film', 'true', 'life', 'weariness', 'evident', 'age', 'did', 'not', 'detract', 'performance', 'did', 'not', 'differ', 'materially', 'laid', 'back', 'had', 'earlier', 'showed', 'Lou', 'Gehrig', 'Alvin', 'York', 'disgraced', 'Colonel', 'Billy', 'Mitchell', 'Cooper', 'stone', 'face', 'immense', 'dignity', 'maintain', 'purpose', 'others', 'lose', 'theirs', 'heat', 'moment', 'Colonel', 'Mitchell', 'seen', 'too', 'many', 'trusted', 'comrades', 'die', 'when', 'knew', 'deaths', 'were', 'caused', 'criminal', 'negligence', 'military', 'superiors', 'Mitchell', 'unthinkable', 'public', 'accusations', 'court', 'martialed.The', 'first', 'up', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'sterling', 'performances', 'Jack', 'Lord', 'Elizabeth', 'Montgomery', 'Darren', 'McGavin', 'friends', 'die', 'can', 'sense', 'Mitchell', 'iron-bound', 'duty', 'not', 'break', 'chain', 'command', 'beginning', 'rust', 'dramatic', 'center', 'first', 'half', 'internal', 'Cooper', 'man', 'who', 'what', 'do', 'forbidden', 'do', 'second', 'half', 'trial', 'Cooper', 'share', 'center', 'stage', 'Charles', 'Bickford', 'presiding', 'judge', 'young', 'arrogant', 'Rod', 'Steiger', 'prosecuting', 'attorney', 'Cooper', 'rare', 'balancing', 'act', 'successfully', 'military', 'jury', 'audience', 'attention', 'need', 'aviation', 'reform', 'not', 'allowing', 'film', 'sink', ""'message"", 'movie', 'might', 'otherwise', 'have', 'been', 'literally', 'true', 'less', 'interesting', 'One', 'reasons', 'enabled', 'Cooper', 'be', 'megastar', 'was', 'was', 'ability', 'say', 'commonsense', 'things', 'straightforward', 'way', 'never', 'let', 'audience', 'forget', 'fully-fleshed', 'character', 'truly', 'believed', 'veracity', 'words', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'Steiger', 'make', 'Cooper', 'look', 'foolish', 'witness', 'stand', 'Steiger', 'implication', 'army', 'was', 'foolish', 'not', 'heeding', 'Colonel', 'Mitchell', 'many', 'warnings', 'need', 'upgrade', 'American', 'air', 'force', 'movie', 'rather', 'abruptly', 'hint', 'Mitchell', 'foresight', 'would', 'one', 'day', 'be', 'vindicated', 'audience', 'denied', 'pleasure', 'seeing', 'Colonel', 'Mitchell', 'vindicated', 'then', 'contrast', 'integrity', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'only', 'gut', 'feelings', 'guide', 'stamps', 'rarest', 'men', 'one', 'who', 'strong', 'convictions', 'unafraid', 'place', 'job', 'character', 'line', 'express']",Court Martial of Billy Mitchell VHS

Gary Cooper is a favorite, and being a baby boomer what red blooded american boy wasn't in love with Elizabeth Montgomery in the 60's?  My low review isn't for this classic film but the company that issues this and is issuing a lot of classics from the Republic Pictures and Paramount valuts, Olive Films. Because they've been releasing so many classic films from John Wayne to Robert Mitchum...I think I've bought about 40 of their blu rays. They do have fun covers that feature original art but they also feature Criterion Films sized list prices!!  Nearly 30 bucks for a 60 minute black and white John Wayne film is not an uncommon expense. They obviously know they have a stranglehold on us collectors and are taking full advantage. The problem is that they rarely if ever bring anything to the party that their lower priced competitors do in the way of special features (heck in their substandard BR of McLintock they lost all the wonderful special features of the Paramount DVDMcLintock.My biggest gripe with Olive and why I say ""when you buy Olive you get the pits"" is that they do NO remastering , NO fixing , NO color correction, they take whatever print they have in whatever state, and release it as is. Because of the instability of color , it ends up that the movies of the 40's in Black in White are often better looking than some of their 50's and 60's color releases.

And about the movie. I got a fantastic price. Some places The Court-Martial of Billy Mitchell can be really expensive. Why? Well this is a historical classic starring the legendary Gary Cooper at his best. Imagine, General Mitchell got kicked out of the Army Air Corp for accurately predicting the comming of the Japanese invasion of Pearl Harbor. Like Nostradamus he was deadly on target. And the stuck on stupid in power military leadership destroyed him. Since they are still stuck on stupid we rarely see this movie on TV. Even on TCM.

206880,A2KNX6Y72E1FVJ,6300208060,"V. Risoli ""black farmer""","[2, 2]","Olive Films usually does a good job in bringing out some of Paramount and Republic's unwanted DVDs and Blu-rays, but in the case of Otto Preminger's 1955 otherwise out-of-print ""The Court-Martial of Billy Mitchell"" starring Gary Cooper, they somehow lost it.  Several times, it seems at the change of a reel, they had to re-focus the projector, the color was all washed out and generally a poor transfer. (I guess it makes a big difference if you buy the Blu-ray). Elizabeth Montgomery, Darren McGavin, Jack Lord, Ralph Bellamy, Rod Steiger, Peter Graves, Fred Clark, and Charles Bickford are all in the film, too, and Preminger directs with the usual economy, efficiency and ability.  It is believed he took on the project because he saw himself wanting to be invested in Mitchell's causes, his mastery at courtroom dramas (his masterpiece is ""Anatomy of a Murder""), and taking somewhat of a backseat, as this was not an independent production for Otto as he had undertaken in 1953 with his production of ""The Moon is Blue"" and defied the Hollywood studio code and helped usher in, as with most of his films, especially as an independent, newer bounds regarding censorship, as ""Court-Martial of Billy Mitchell"" with its built-in controversy about a now little known landmark in our country's Department of Defense, was a studio project.  Warner Brothers originally owned the project, which Preminger did for the money and a percentage.  1955 also saw the release of Preminger's independent production of ""The Man with the Golden Arm"" which pushed the envelope again on the code, it being the first film to deal openly with drug addiction.
