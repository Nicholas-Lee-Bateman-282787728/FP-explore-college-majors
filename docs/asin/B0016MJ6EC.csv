From the movie Albert was jobless and in a somewhat disfunctional marriage and was paid to appear in police line ups.  It only shows Albert killing one woman.  The rest are done by other people.  Yet, it mentions that the 5 original victims were older and the others were copycats.  So Albert didn't kill every one of them...but only the one?  Anyway, when the police arrest him the movie doesn't show why or what evidence they have on him.  The police just pull him over in a car and the next thing you know Albert is in jail.  It would have been nice to have been shown the reasons.  Also, the movie never cleared up why exactly Albert was so attached to his prison roommate.  The acting was ok.  It was interesting to see the young man who played Bud Bundy in a much different role.",1,disappointing,1299888000,"03 12, 2011",2011,912,"['were', 'serial', 'killer', 'kick', 'decided', 'check', 'out', 'was', 'very', 'slow', 'Also', 'lack', 'information', 'movie', 'Albert', 'was', 'jobless', 'somewhat', 'disfunctional', 'marriage', 'was', 'paid', 'appear', 'police', 'line', 'ups', 'only', 'Albert', 'killing', 'one', 'woman', 'rest', 'are', 'done', 'other', 'people', '5', 'original', 'victims', 'were', 'older', 'others', 'were', 'copycats', 'So', 'Albert', 'did', ""n't"", 'kill', 'one', 'only', 'one', 'Anyway', 'when', 'police', 'arrest', 'movie', ""n't"", 'show', 'why', 'what', 'evidence', 'have', 'police', 'just', 'pull', 'over', 'car', 'next', 'thing', 'know', 'Albert', 'jail', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'been', 'shown', 'reasons', 'Also', 'movie', 'never', 'cleared', 'up', 'why', 'exactly', 'Albert', 'was', 'so', 'attached', 'prison', 'roommate', 'acting', 'was', 'ok', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'played', 'Bud', 'Bundy', 'much', 'different', 'role']",The Boston Strangler
1153896,A32VWVQ9WEAFWZ,B0016MJ6EC,Mason C,"[1, 1]","Now that is is commonly accepted that Albert DeSalvo was most likely not the Boston Strangler, but instead was just a sneaky little conman & pervert, who just happened to be locked up in a mental asylum with several known psychopaths & serial killers, most of whom were out at the time of the stranglings, including the sociopath George Nassar who is protrayed in the film as the real killer. So, as opposed to the Tony Curtis classic, which is basically a fictionalized version of these crimes (like how Texas Chainsaw Massacre was a fictionalized version of Ed Gein), this film is very low budget, but director Mike Feifer is vetren in the serial killer movies field & ol' Bud Bundy himself David Faustino does, in my opinon, the greatest, most accurate depiction of Albert De Salvo that was ever on film. Overall, a good little film.",5,Closer to the truth,1322265600,"11 26, 2011",2011,836,"['Now', 'commonly', 'accepted', 'Albert', 'DeSalvo', 'was', 'most', 'likely', 'not', 'Boston', 'Strangler', 'instead', 'was', 'just', 'sneaky', 'little', 'conman', 'pervert', 'who', 'just', 'happened', 'be', 'locked', 'up', 'mental', 'asylum', 'several', 'known', 'psychopaths', 'serial', 'killers', 'most', 'whom', 'were', 'out', 'time', 'stranglings', 'including', 'sociopath', 'George', 'Nassar', 'who', 'protrayed', 'film', 'real', 'killer', 'So', 'opposed', 'Tony', 'Curtis', 'classic', 'basically', 'fictionalized', 'version', 'crimes', 'how', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'was', 'fictionalized', 'version', 'Ed', 'Gein', 'film', 'very', 'low', 'budget', 'director', 'Mike', 'Feifer', 'vetren', 'serial', 'killer', 'movies', 'field', 'ol', 'Bud', 'Bundy', 'David', 'Faustino', 'opinon', 'greatest', 'most', 'accurate', 'depiction', 'Albert', 'De', 'Salvo', 'was', 'ever', 'film', 'Overall', 'good', 'little', 'film']",The Boston Strangler
1153897,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B0016MJ6EC,Michael Butts,"[0, 0]","This ""untold story"" of Albert DeSalvo, who claimed to be The Boston Strangler suggests that Desalvo really wasn't guilty and was merely a conman and pervert.  It has been assumed that Desalvo was not the Strangler due to evidence collected later and the case remains unsolved.David Faustino (MARRIED WITH CHILDREN) is miscast as Desalvo.  His perfomance is a caricature of method acting with little polish or maturity.  I just didn't find him convincing at all.  Ditto to Andrew Divoff as the world-weary detective, Kostas Sommer as Desalvo's co-conspirator and possibly more, and Corin Nemec's turn as the sheisty lawyer.  Writer/director Michael Feifer has little artistic vision or sense of creativity.  He offers an alternate theory but doesn't commit to exploring or exposing the alternative strangler.Overall, an interesting premise lost in a dull execution.",2,BUD BUNDY CHOKES,1329264000,"02 15, 2012",2012,864,"['untold', 'story', 'Albert', 'DeSalvo', 'who', 'claimed', 'be', 'Boston', 'Strangler', 'Desalvo', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'guilty', 'was', 'merely', 'conman', 'pervert', 'been', 'assumed', 'Desalvo', 'was', 'not', 'Strangler', 'due', 'evidence', 'collected', 'later', 'case', 'unsolved.David', 'Faustino', 'MARRIED', 'WITH', 'CHILDREN', 'miscast', 'Desalvo', 'perfomance', 'caricature', 'method', 'acting', 'little', 'polish', 'maturity', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'convincing', 'Ditto', 'Andrew', 'Divoff', 'world-weary', 'detective', 'Kostas', 'Sommer', 'Desalvo', 'co-conspirator', 'possibly', 'more', 'Corin', 'Nemec', 'turn', 'sheisty', 'lawyer', 'Writer/director', 'Michael', 'Feifer', 'little', 'artistic', 'vision', 'sense', 'creativity', 'alternate', 'theory', ""n't"", 'commit', 'exploring', 'exposing', 'alternative', 'strangler.Overall', 'interesting', 'premise', 'lost', 'dull', 'execution']",The Boston Strangler

This is what we believe is the story of Albert De Salvo (David Faustino), the man who confessed to being the Boston Strangler. The film shows several women being strangled, but not really grindhouse style, more of a Hitchcock style. The accents were good. The acting and plot was decent, although the story just never grabbed me. There is no nudity and no graphic rape scenes, just disturbing strangling scenes. It is interesting from an historical sense, but not overly entertaining, yet not a bad film.
