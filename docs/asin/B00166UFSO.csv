1152306,A3GKMQFL05Z79K,B00166UFSO,blackaciddevil,"[3, 4]","In The Evil Woods, a group of teenagers decide to go on a little weekend getaway to the middle of absolute nowhere to do some camping. While setting around the campfire, they encounter a stranger who tells them the story of a deranged person named Walter whose spirit still lurks in the woods. A day passes and, one by one, they start being killed by someone with an axe. Who is doing the killing? Is it Walter? The Stranger the teenagers encounter? or the bearded guy who watches them all from a distance? To find out, you have to watch the whole movie.Taken for what it is, a slasher movie, The Evil Woods succeeds. But, if you're looking for a catchy killer who's the likes of Jason or Michael Myers, you're not going to find it here. This is your everyday slasher movie that doesn't try too hard to rise above other movies of this kind, which is sad because this movie could've been good if it tried. That's probably why so many reviewers(here and elsewhere) find this movie a boring waste of time. Given, it is quite boring but I wouldn't call it a complete waste of time. The actors/actresses were up to making this movie believable and the filming of it was admirable...it's just the script seriously lacked anything inventive to make it stand out in a sea of other low-budget slasher films. How do you think movies like Friday the 13th made it big?Anyways, The Evil Woods is decent...in my honest opinion. Yet, I wouldn't do more than rent this one at best. Not unless you can find a really, really cheap version in a bargain bin somewhere. Course, you'll probably go away feeling like everyone else does about this film..that you should've steered clear of this movie and rented something else.I will have to hand it to Lionsgate, though, for giving low-budget horror like this a chance to be seen. I've seen some real gems this way. Some that should be seen by the masses.",3,The Evil Woods.......,1237334400,"03 18, 2009",2009,1882,"['Evil', 'Woods', 'group', 'teenagers', 'decide', 'go', 'little', 'weekend', 'getaway', 'middle', 'absolute', 'nowhere', 'do', 'camping', 'setting', 'campfire', 'encounter', 'stranger', 'who', 'story', 'deranged', 'person', 'named', 'Walter', 'spirit', 'still', 'woods', 'day', 'one', 'one', 'start', 'being', 'killed', 'someone', 'axe', 'Who', 'doing', 'killing', 'Walter', 'Stranger', 'teenagers', 'encounter', 'bearded', 'guy', 'who', 'distance', 'find', 'out', 'have', 'watch', 'whole', 'movie.Taken', 'what', 'slasher', 'movie', 'Evil', 'Woods', ""'re"", 'looking', 'catchy', 'killer', 'who', 'likes', 'Jason', 'Michael', 'Myers', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'find', 'here', 'everyday', 'slasher', 'movie', ""n't"", 'try', 'too', 'hard', 'rise', 'other', 'movies', 'kind', 'sad', 'movie', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'good', 'tried', 'probably', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'reviewers', 'here', 'elsewhere', 'find', 'movie', 'boring', 'waste', 'time', 'Given', 'quite', 'boring', 'would', ""n't"", 'call', 'complete', 'waste', 'time', 'actors/actresses', 'were', 'up', 'making', 'movie', 'believable', 'filming', 'was', 'admirable', 'just', 'script', 'seriously', 'lacked', 'anything', 'inventive', 'make', 'stand', 'out', 'sea', 'other', 'low-budget', 'slasher', 'films', 'How', 'do', 'think', 'movies', 'Friday', '13th', 'made', 'big', 'Anyways', 'Evil', 'Woods', 'decent', 'honest', 'opinion', 'would', ""n't"", 'do', 'more', 'rent', 'one', 'best', 'Not', 'can', 'find', 'really', 'really', 'cheap', 'version', 'bargain', 'bin', 'somewhere', 'Course', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'go', 'away', 'feeling', 'everyone', 'else', 'film..that', 'should', ""'ve"", 'steered', 'clear', 'movie', 'rented', 'something', 'else.I', 'will', 'have', 'hand', 'Lionsgate', 'though', 'giving', 'low-budget', 'horror', 'chance', 'be', 'seen', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'real', 'gems', 'way', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'masses']","Evil Woods, The"
1152307,A2DQR20UWY2G0Y,B00166UFSO,"Dr. Metal ""e23adams""","[2, 3]","This B Movie isen't as bad as the other reviews claim it to be, having said that though it isen't exactly good either.  More or less, your average type of Horror flick.  The low budget aspect didn't bother me, cause it really dosen't show since almost the entire movie is filmed outdoors in the woods, as the title suggests.  The acting isen't something memorable in any way, but it gets the job done.  I would say the acting is average or slightly below average.The plot, well, as it is usually the case with horror movies, there isen't much of a plot to begin with.  I mean its stereo-typical:  5 college students, 3 girls and 2 guys decided to go camping outdoors in a supposedly cool place, which is actually (you guessed it) in the middle of nowhere.  Of course there are the inevitable clichees that horror films always exhibit: Cell phones not working, since there no net support in a deserted forest.  And a psychopath killer roaming around the place where the students want to party.For a low budget film this isen't bad, and its even somewhat entertaining.  The end was a slight surprise, but really nothing special.  So in the end, this is only recommendable to those that can't get enough of horror movies, and don't mind low budget films.",3,Not as bad as the other reviews suggest!,1260144000,"12 7, 2009",2009,1251,"['B', 'Movie', 'ise', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'other', 'reviews', 'claim', 'be', 'having', 'said', 'ise', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'good', 'either', 'More', 'less', 'average', 'type', 'Horror', 'flick', 'low', 'budget', 'aspect', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'cause', 'really', 'dose', ""n't"", 'show', 'almost', 'entire', 'movie', 'filmed', 'outdoors', 'woods', 'title', 'acting', 'ise', ""n't"", 'something', 'memorable', 'way', 'job', 'done', 'would', 'say', 'acting', 'average', 'slightly', 'average.The', 'plot', 'well', 'usually', 'case', 'horror', 'movies', 'ise', ""n't"", 'much', 'plot', 'begin', 'mean', 'stereo-typical', '5', 'college', 'students', '3', 'girls', '2', 'guys', 'decided', 'go', 'camping', 'outdoors', 'supposedly', 'cool', 'place', 'actually', 'guessed', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'course', 'are', 'inevitable', 'clichees', 'horror', 'films', 'always', 'exhibit', 'Cell', 'not', 'working', 'net', 'support', 'deserted', 'forest', 'psychopath', 'killer', 'roaming', 'place', 'where', 'students', 'want', 'party.For', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'ise', ""n't"", 'bad', 'even', 'somewhat', 'entertaining', 'end', 'was', 'slight', 'surprise', 'really', 'nothing', 'special', 'So', 'end', 'only', 'recommendable', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'horror', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'low', 'budget', 'films']","Evil Woods, The"

1152309,A1M0YAZ6JV488Z,B00166UFSO,"Tom's Reviews ""Tom Hunter""","[3, 4]","There are a few hurdles you'll need to overcome in order to watch this one. First, in the opening scene around a campfire you will be introduced to one of the most annoying actors/characters ever in a B-movie - the guy is so tediously happy and grinning that you alomst wonder if he's stoned, as he's got that perpetual ""I'm sooo high, dude"" attitude (when, in fact, he's not high) that you'll just be begging for the killer to come around the campfire with an axe and relieve us all of the character. Thankfully, he is put out of our misery fairly soon.  Next, you'll be treated to something I never thought a video could botch...the LONGEST, MOST TEDIOUS opening credits that you will ever encounter... THAT may be the horror of this movie.  But, get past those two things, and you may find you enjoyed this one, if only compared to other B-Horror movies. Unfortunately, I was so put off by the aforementioned scenes that I started the movie with a negative outlook. I look forward to other reviews to see if it's just me, or if I was right on :)  OH - and you are going to need to suspend disbelief with regard to the main character, the guy with the cop glasses. He is supposed to be playing some really cool guy, making fun of the other characters, when in fact he just looks like a member of the chess club with a bowl haircut - seriously miscast in this role. Nerds just can't pull off the ""too cool for the room"" type characters.",1,Read all the reviews before you rent or buy this one...,1216684800,"07 22, 2008",2008,1437,"['are', 'few', 'hurdles', ""'ll"", 'need', 'overcome', 'order', 'watch', 'one', 'First', 'opening', 'scene', 'campfire', 'will', 'be', 'introduced', 'one', 'most', 'annoying', 'actors/characters', 'ever', 'B-movie', 'guy', 'so', 'tediously', 'happy', 'grinning', 'alomst', 'wonder', 'stoned', 'got', 'perpetual', ""'m"", 'sooo', 'high', 'dude', 'attitude', 'when', 'fact', 'not', 'high', ""'ll"", 'just', 'be', 'begging', 'killer', 'come', 'campfire', 'axe', 'relieve', 'character', 'Thankfully', 'put', 'misery', 'fairly', 'soon', 'Next', ""'ll"", 'be', 'treated', 'something', 'never', 'thought', 'video', 'could', 'botch', 'LONGEST', 'MOST', 'TEDIOUS', 'opening', 'credits', 'will', 'ever', 'encounter', 'THAT', 'may', 'be', 'horror', 'movie', 'get', 'two', 'things', 'may', 'find', 'enjoyed', 'one', 'only', 'compared', 'other', 'B-Horror', 'movies', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'so', 'put', 'off', 'aforementioned', 'scenes', 'started', 'movie', 'negative', 'outlook', 'look', 'forward', 'other', 'reviews', 'see', 'just', 'was', 'right', 'OH', 'are', 'going', 'need', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'regard', 'main', 'character', 'guy', 'cop', 'glasses', 'supposed', 'be', 'playing', 'really', 'cool', 'guy', 'making', 'fun', 'other', 'characters', 'when', 'fact', 'just', 'member', 'chess', 'club', 'bowl', 'haircut', 'seriously', 'miscast', 'role', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pull', 'off', 'too', 'cool', 'room', 'type', 'characters']","Evil Woods, The"
