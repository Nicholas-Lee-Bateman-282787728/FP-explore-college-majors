856097,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B0006284KA,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[18, 18]","This is the second video I've tried from the Walk It Off with George series; again, I found working out with George to be both fun AND a great workout!  Walk and Box offers a basic walking workout but adds interest with a few boxing moves--mostly boxer shuffles and basic punches--as well as ""boxing blasts,"" which are four 1-minute higher intensity bursts interspersed throughout the workout.Although George is a prominent feature during the video, the workout is actually led by veteran instructor Petra Kolber, with George making occasional motivational comments throughout. Petra begins with a basic aerobic warm-up that is approximately 6 minutes long; however, I found that the warm-up quickly raised my heart rate into the fat-burning zone.  The main body of the workout consists of very simple steps such as the basic walk (marching in place), side steps, boxer shuffles, and the ""Foreman shuffle"" (marching forward and back with a tap).  Petra relies on George to introduce the punches--jab, hook, and uppercut--and then she incorporates a ""fitness"" version of each.  During the higher intensity drills, Petra gives you various options, including a fast walk/shuffle, jogging, or mock jumping rope.  The workout ends with a 4 minute cool-down which consists of two minutes of slowing the heart rate followed by two minutes of stretching.I am an intermediate exerciser, so this workout was a bit on the easy side for me, but I had no problems modifying the intensity to meet my needs (eg, adding weighted gloves, making the movements bigger and more bouncy, incorporating knee lifts, etc.) and thus keeping my heart rated elevated throughout the entire workout.  As compared to Leslie Sansone's walking workouts, I find the Walk It Off with George series to be more fun:  the music is more upbeat, George is a big goofball, and he and Petra have a great rapport.  Overall, this was a very enjoyable workout that I know I will use often--highly recommended!",5,FUN workout appropriate for a variety of fitness levels!,1136419200,"01 5, 2006",2006,1964,"['second', 'video', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'Walk', 'Off', 'George', 'series', 'again', 'found', 'working', 'out', 'George', 'be', 'fun', 'great', 'workout', 'Walk', 'Box', 'basic', 'walking', 'workout', 'interest', 'few', 'boxing', 'moves', 'mostly', 'shuffles', 'basic', 'punches', 'as', 'well', 'boxing', 'blasts', 'are', 'four', '1-minute', 'higher', 'intensity', 'bursts', 'interspersed', 'workout.Although', 'George', 'prominent', 'feature', 'video', 'workout', 'actually', 'led', 'veteran', 'instructor', 'Petra', 'Kolber', 'George', 'making', 'occasional', 'motivational', 'comments', 'Petra', 'basic', 'aerobic', 'warm-up', 'approximately', '6', 'minutes', 'long', 'however', 'found', 'warm-up', 'quickly', 'raised', 'heart', 'rate', 'fat-burning', 'zone', 'main', 'body', 'workout', 'very', 'simple', 'steps', 'such', 'basic', 'walk', 'marching', 'place', 'side', 'steps', 'boxer', 'shuffles', 'Foreman', 'shuffle', 'marching', 'forward', 'back', 'tap', 'Petra', 'George', 'introduce', 'punches', 'jab', 'hook', 'uppercut', 'then', 'fitness', 'version', 'higher', 'intensity', 'drills', 'Petra', 'various', 'options', 'including', 'fast', 'walk/shuffle', 'jogging', 'mock', 'jumping', 'rope', 'workout', '4', 'minute', 'cool-down', 'two', 'minutes', 'slowing', 'heart', 'rate', 'followed', 'two', 'minutes', 'stretching.I', 'am', 'intermediate', 'exerciser', 'workout', 'was', 'bit', 'easy', 'side', 'had', 'problems', 'modifying', 'intensity', 'meet', 'needs', 'eg', 'adding', 'weighted', 'gloves', 'making', 'movements', 'bigger', 'more', 'bouncy', 'incorporating', 'knee', 'lifts', 'etc', 'thus', 'keeping', 'heart', 'rated', 'elevated', 'entire', 'workout', 'compared', 'Leslie', 'Sansone', 'walking', 'workouts', 'find', 'Walk', 'Off', 'George', 'series', 'be', 'more', 'fun', 'music', 'more', 'upbeat', 'George', 'big', 'goofball', 'Petra', 'have', 'great', 'rapport', 'Overall', 'was', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'know', 'will', 'use', 'often', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A
856098,A3FEX2RN3Q5XT4,B0006284KA,C. Daly,"[4, 4]","I like low intensity cardio workouts like Leslie Sansone, but do get bored of them, so I'm always looking for something new.  I didn't really enjoy Circuit Walk, because of the constant squats/lunges, but thought it had promise so I decided to try this one.  It was A LOT more intense than I was expecting, mainly because I'm not used to jumping/hopping for a minute straight.This workout is led by George Forman and Petra Kolber.  Mostly Petra just talks about how great George is and George has a great time playing it up for the camera. The steps are fairly simple--marching in place, marching back and forth, step touches, and bob and weaves.  Basic punches are also added in (jab, cross, hook), but for a workout called ""walk and box"" there was surprisingly little upper body work.  Interspersed throughout this workout were ""boxing blasts"" which were short intervals of jumping or jogging in place.  I found these quite challenging and my heartrate was up the whole time as a result, even though the rest of the workout was not that difficult.At nearly 45 minutes, this workout is a bit long and not something I can do on weekdays.  I did enjoy it, although I wish there were more variety overall in the steps and I wish there were some kicking.  For a walking/kickboxing fusion workout, I prefer Leslie Sansone's Walk and Kick.",4,"Basic steps, medium intensity workout",1181433600,"06 10, 2007",2007,1334,"['like', 'low', 'intensity', 'cardio', 'workouts', 'Leslie', 'Sansone', 'do', 'get', 'bored', ""'m"", 'always', 'looking', 'something', 'new', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'enjoy', 'Circuit', 'Walk', 'constant', 'squats/lunges', 'thought', 'had', 'promise', 'so', 'decided', 'try', 'one', 'was', 'A', 'LOT', 'more', 'intense', 'was', 'expecting', 'mainly', ""'m"", 'not', 'used', 'jumping/hopping', 'minute', 'straight.This', 'workout', 'led', 'George', 'Forman', 'Petra', 'Kolber', 'Mostly', 'Petra', 'just', 'talks', 'how', 'great', 'George', 'George', 'great', 'time', 'playing', 'camera', 'steps', 'are', 'fairly', 'simple', 'marching', 'place', 'marching', 'back', 'forth', 'step', 'touches', 'bob', 'weaves', 'Basic', 'punches', 'are', 'also', 'added', 'jab', 'cross', 'hook', 'workout', 'called', 'walk', 'box', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'little', 'upper', 'body', 'work', 'Interspersed', 'workout', 'were', 'boxing', 'blasts', 'were', 'short', 'intervals', 'jumping', 'jogging', 'place', 'found', 'quite', 'challenging', 'heartrate', 'was', 'whole', 'time', 'result', 'even', 'rest', 'workout', 'was', 'not', 'difficult.At', 'nearly', '45', 'minutes', 'workout', 'bit', 'long', 'not', 'something', 'can', 'do', 'weekdays', 'did', 'enjoy', 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'variety', 'overall', 'steps', 'wish', 'were', 'kicking', 'walking/kickboxing', 'fusion', 'prefer', 'Leslie', 'Sansone', 'Walk', 'Kick']",N/A

It gives an all over workout without being high impact, and also incorporates intervals to help boost fitness level.

You can go all out, or keep the workout at a lower fitness level -- Foreman stresses for everyone to do what they can do.I love this workout because it's fun and also because it's a great workout for my legs, waist and butt.

George who was a profesional boxerdemonstrates some of his signature moves as a boxer,ie, upper cut, bob and weave etc.  Petra is great!  She tells you the moveahead of time and demonstrates each move before the sequence, all done to fun music that doesn't disrupt the flow of the routines.If you follow her directions correctly (which she demonstrates), you will work your entire body, legs, upper body and waist.  This routine is 46 minutes long but it goes by fast because there are 4 exercise burst (interval training) mixed in between the boxing routines to get your heartrate up.
