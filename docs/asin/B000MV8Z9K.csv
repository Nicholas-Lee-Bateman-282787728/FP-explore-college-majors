1051304,A3NW2MN6JH8OL3,B000MV8Z9K,Almost 50 Lassie fan,"[0, 0]","I am not someone normally inclined to watch ""political"" programs.  Yet, several years ago I found myself rather ""sucked in"" to the West Wing. The reason was that although the venue was the political arena, the issues the players confronted--with family, coworkers, friends, etc--were universal to all of us, or at least many issues were. That can also be said about this series. I really didn't know HOW to feel about this series after Episode 1. Yet, I felt compelled to watch Episode 2, and so on till the series was over.  I have a rudimentary knowledge of Britain's political process, enough to understand more about it than Ros in Episode 1!  But most viewers can relate to family issues presented here, relationship issues--between lovers, coworkers--, betrayal, the negative and positive impact of the media on our public figures and their loved ones, etc.  The show is paced well, the acting is top notch (many familiar faces here for those who watch BBC America or PBS), script blends comedy into the drama quite often.  I really ended up enjoying this. One and only negative for me--the two final screens that explain Ros's decision and its impact. When I saw the show on my local PBS station (that episode twice), I did NOT see those two final screens. I actually preferred what I THOUGHT she did--divorce the turkey! It made more story sense!",4,Much better than I expected,1247270400,"07 11, 2009",2009,1354,"['am', 'not', 'someone', 'normally', 'inclined', 'watch', 'political', 'programs', 'Yet', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'found', 'rather', 'sucked', 'West', 'Wing', 'reason', 'was', 'venue', 'was', 'political', 'arena', 'issues', 'players', 'confronted', 'family', 'coworkers', 'friends', 'etc', 'were', 'universal', 'least', 'many', 'issues', 'were', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'said', 'series', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'HOW', 'feel', 'series', 'Episode', '1', 'felt', 'compelled', 'watch', 'Episode', '2', 'so', 'till', 'series', 'was', 'have', 'rudimentary', 'knowledge', 'Britain', 'political', 'process', 'enough', 'understand', 'more', 'Ros', 'Episode', '1', 'most', 'viewers', 'can', 'relate', 'family', 'issues', 'presented', 'here', 'relationship', 'issues', 'lovers', 'coworkers', 'betrayal', 'negative', 'positive', 'impact', 'media', 'public', 'figures', 'loved', 'ones', 'etc', 'show', 'paced', 'well', 'acting', 'top', 'notch', 'many', 'familiar', 'here', 'who', 'watch', 'BBC', 'America', 'PBS', 'script', 'comedy', 'drama', 'quite', 'often', 'really', 'ended', 'up', 'enjoying', 'One', 'only', 'negative', 'two', 'final', 'screens', 'explain', 'Ros', 'decision', 'impact', 'When', 'saw', 'show', 'local', 'PBS', 'station', 'episode', 'twice', 'did', 'NOT', 'see', 'two', 'final', 'screens', 'actually', 'preferred', 'what', 'THOUGHT', 'did', 'divorce', 'turkey', 'made', 'more', 'story', 'sense']",The Amazing Mrs Pritchard
1051305,A2RW587355CMVA,B000MV8Z9K,almosthappy,"[3, 6]","Lately, perhaps as a reaction to the harsh reality, there have been lots of fantasy based TV series coming out on either sides of the pond. This BBC One mini-series, in essence, is also a fantasy - in this case about politics. Ros Pritchard, played by Jane Horrocks (relative unknown to North American audience. Horrocks has appeared previous on Absolutely Fabulous, among others), a supermarket manager, not particularly pleased with either the liberals and the conservatives in her country, decided to create her own party, ""Purple Democratic Alliance"" and run for the office of Prime Minister. Ros's grass-root campaign, appearing almost overnight on the cover of national news weeklies and popular dailies, quickly gained strong foothold. Against a current of oppositions form old-guard politicians, Ros has won the election. What follows, in the subsequently episode, is a fusion of West Wing and any-other BBC style TV drama. Ros's new Prime Minister position has to face a series of political challenges, including many issues involving foreign relationship (German plane crash, G8 in Vancouver, terrorism etc.) The currentness of the issues, perhaps, is the reason that makes the show more interesting and appealing than it sounds on paper. It tapped a common fantasy - a lot of common janes and joes like you and I are not particular happy with Blair (Ros is replacing Blair in the series), or with Bush for that matter. We all feel we can probably do a better job than these infamous leaders of our time. And yere comes a everywoman, through fantastic means, she has achieved the impossible. Now that she - which is really a dramatic caricature of a common viewer - is in a position to make a difference and do a better job than Blair, will she? In this regard, I do feel Horrocks has done a respectable job of creating a housewife that's easily identifiable, thereby allowing audience to fantasize through her performance, even to a North American audience. The series ended rather abruptly, I feel. Without spoiling the detail, I can say the show ended with a scandal and the resolution of it (or lack of thereof) feels rather forced. This mini-series could use a few extra episodes to develop. Even though this show is not on the same level as BBC classics such as Fawlty Towers or the The Office, it is indeed enjoyable could definitely use a few more episodes like the aforementioned series.",4,"Political fantasy.

1051306,A6VPK7X53QNAQ,B000MV8Z9K,"AmazonDiva ""Keep Calm and Carry On.""","[3, 5]","The Amazing Mrs. Pritchard tells of the amazing story of the rise of Ros Pritchard from a grocery store manager to the Prime Minister's office. The slogan of her Purple Alliance is ""Politics is not Rocket Science"", but as she later discovers, there is definitely some intelligent thought invested in making split-second decisions.I watched the series episodes one after the other as it was engaging enough to make me wonder what happened next. It also has some great actors - Jane McTeer put in a strong performance as the Councellor of the Exchequer and in my opinion was the real hero of this series. Jodhi May gave another great performance as the right arm of the Prime Minister. Jane Horrocks was good too, but was overshadowed a little by the other strong actresses surrounding her. I watched the series with great anticipation but episode after episode left me admiring the Councellor more than the Prime Minister. The series started off with a bang, the speech Ros Prtichard made as a Prime Minister was inspiring as it urged the people to think about what they wanted for their country and to be more involved in politics.The first episode was believable but subsequently by the second episode I had a sense of disappointment that this series was not shaping up to be a real political drama as I'd expected. It would have been interesting to learn of the reforms made by the new Prime Minister given her uniqueness as ""not being a real politician"" despite the ire of the opposition. It looked promising for a while when the Prime Minister chose to send her daughter to a inner city school with a dodgy reputation...it could have turned into an episode about education reform. Instead, the series never seemed to make any hard-hitting points.After the first 2 episodes it began to seem more like a soap opera which detailed  Ros Pritchard's family life which was disintegrating due to her new job. It made half-hearted attempt to show some political reform, the best of them being a no-cars Wednesday which the Prime Minister announced on a whim after a G8 summit right around the completion of her first 12 months in office. That to me was where the series turned into a mockery of real governance. What Prime Minister would announce that on a whim without thinking of how this plan would be executed, even if that PM was store manager in their past life? In fact, her role as a grocery store manager would have taught her the importance of planning and execution.The series seemed to run out of fizz in the last few episodes and only the Councellor Catherine Walker (Janet McTeer) kept it interesting enough to keep watching.At the end I was left thinking how great this show could have been if only it had exploited the true potential of what seemed like a great plot.",3,"Engaging mini-series, great acting but not the tight political drama I expected.",1191715200,"10 7, 2007",2007,2779,"['Amazing', 'Mrs.', 'Pritchard', 'amazing', 'story', 'rise', 'Ros', 'Pritchard', 'grocery', 'store', 'manager', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'office', 'slogan', 'Purple', 'Alliance', 'Politics', 'not', 'Rocket', 'Science', 'later', 'discovers', 'definitely', 'intelligent', 'thought', 'invested', 'making', 'split-second', 'decisions.I', 'watched', 'series', 'one', 'other', 'was', 'engaging', 'enough', 'make', 'wonder', 'what', 'happened', 'next', 'also', 'great', 'actors', 'Jane', 'McTeer', 'put', 'strong', 'performance', 'Councellor', 'Exchequer', 'opinion', 'was', 'real', 'hero', 'series', 'Jodhi', 'May', 'gave', 'great', 'performance', 'right', 'arm', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Jane', 'Horrocks', 'was', 'good', 'too', 'was', 'overshadowed', 'little', 'other', 'strong', 'actresses', 'surrounding', 'watched', 'series', 'great', 'anticipation', 'episode', 'episode', 'left', 'admiring', 'Councellor', 'more', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'series', 'started', 'off', 'bang', 'speech', 'Ros', 'Prtichard', 'made', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'was', 'inspiring', 'urged', 'people', 'think', 'what', 'wanted', 'country', 'be', 'more', 'involved', 'politics.The', 'first', 'episode', 'was', 'believable', 'subsequently', 'second', 'episode', 'had', 'sense', 'disappointment', 'series', 'was', 'not', 'shaping', 'up', 'be', 'real', 'political', 'drama', ""'d"", 'expected', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'learn', 'reforms', 'made', 'new', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'given', 'uniqueness', 'not', 'being', 'real', 'politician', 'ire', 'opposition', 'looked', 'promising', 'while', 'when', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'chose', 'send', 'daughter', 'inner', 'city', 'school', 'dodgy', 'reputation', 'could', 'have', 'turned', 'episode', 'education', 'reform', 'Instead', 'series', 'never', 'seemed', 'make', 'hard-hitting', 'points.After', 'first', '2', 'episodes', 'began', 'seem', 'more', 'soap', 'opera', 'detailed', 'Ros', 'Pritchard', 'family', 'life', 'was', 'disintegrating', 'due', 'new', 'job', 'made', 'half-hearted', 'attempt', 'show', 'political', 'reform', 'best', 'being', 'no-cars', 'Wednesday', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'announced', 'whim', 'G8', 'summit', 'right', 'completion', 'first', '12', 'months', 'office', 'was', 'where', 'series', 'turned', 'mockery', 'real', 'governance', 'What', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'would', 'announce', 'whim', 'thinking', 'how', 'plan', 'would', 'be', 'executed', 'even', 'PM', 'was', 'store', 'manager', 'past', 'life', 'fact', 'role', 'grocery', 'store', 'manager', 'would', 'have', 'taught', 'importance', 'planning', 'execution.The', 'series', 'seemed', 'run', 'out', 'fizz', 'last', 'few', 'episodes', 'only', 'Councellor', 'Catherine', 'Walker', 'Janet', 'McTeer', 'kept', 'interesting', 'enough', 'keep', 'end', 'was', 'left', 'thinking', 'how', 'great', 'show', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'only', 'had', 'exploited', 'true', 'potential', 'what', 'seemed', 'great', 'plot']",The Amazing Mrs Pritchard
1051307,A2I17T9XB6LSGW,B000MV8Z9K,Andrew McCaffrey,"[5, 10]","I think the biggest problem I had with THE AMAZING MRS. PRITCHARD is that even after viewing all six episodes, I still wasn't sure what this miniseries was trying to be.Given the rather thin, unrealistic and somewhat fantastical nature of the story, were the producers aiming towards fun, family entertainment?  Probably not, given some of the language used and some of the topics discussed.Was the goal to have a sharp, biting commentary on the state of politics in the world today?  Again, probably not, since the script tended to back away whenever it approached anything deep, the serious subjects were almost always resolved with a joke, and the satire never really found its teeth.Did the creators want to put a spotlight on the difficulty that political figures have in maintaining both a Teflon-like public exterior and a private, personal family life?  Again, I didn't think so, because -- while this made up a number of subplots -- the series never really found anything new to say on the subject.So that's where I was after six episodes.  Actually, that's where I was at the end of the first episode.  The show's flaws were evident from the beginning and no story-arcs or sudden character revelations could save it.The premise is relative straightforward.  The eponymous (or is it amazing?) Mrs. Pritchard is a very capable supermarket manager.  During the run-up to an election for the British parliament, two opposing candidates get up on their respective soapboxes in front of Pritchard's shop.  Harsh words lead to physical blows and -- with the news cameras running -- Mrs. Pritchard verbally lays into both politicians, ridiculing them for their inability to get simple things done and their predilection for lying to the voting public.Her commonsense message set off a media storm, and by the end of the day she has already filed to run for the seat herself and a nascent political party is beginning to coalesce into existence around her.And this is where I left the party.Of course what Mrs. Pritchard is saying has validity.  The problem I had is twofold.  First of all, what she is saying is far too obvious to really be truly revolutionary.  Second, her message is the exact same message that everyone running for office against an incumbent says.  They all criticize their opponents for the above, then turn to the camera and promise to tell the people the truth.  Sometimes it works.  Sometimes it doesn't.  But it isn't a particularly world changing set of statements.Now, as annoyed as I was with the first episode, I was willing to swallow this unbelievable premise if only to see how the writers would deal with the plot device of having a genuinely ordinary woman as the head of government.  But the types of illogical leaps required to reach the initial premise were repeated over and over.  Seemingly impossible tasks were achieved simply by having Mrs. Pritchard assert that they would be achieved.Alternatively, conflicts would arise from absolutely nowhere, be given a huge amount of attention, but disappear without trace.  While some threads did manage to reach a logical conclusion, I waiting for some of the earlier story-lines to at least be referenced again (if not wrapped up), yet I was left disappointed.  (To be fair, it's possible that the producers were expecting to continue into another season/series, but since that doesn't seem to be happening I can only judge by what is available to me.)THE AMAZING MRS. PRITCHARD is one of those situations where I end up feeling sorry for the cast, because for the most part I think the actors and actresses did an extremely good job, especially when one considers what they had to work with.Janet McTeer did a lot with very little.  As the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the second-in-command to Jane Horrocks' Prime Minister, she was excellent as a commanding presence without falling into melodrama.  Jodhi May as the political spin-doctor could have easily turned in a one-note performance, but she did not.The actors playing Pritchard's family were also quite good.  I found Steven Mackintosh as Mr. Pritchard to be a very sympathetic character despite the script leaving him in most scenes with little to do other than look haggard and sip from a half-empty tumbler of whiskey.  Credit is also due to Carey Mulligan as the elder daughter who managed to infuse her character with a real sense of grace despite the somewhat random (and inexplicable) indignities the script threw her way.Despite the best efforts of everyone on the front side of the camera, I couldn't really believe anything that MRS. PRITCHARD was trying to say.  The political message is too shallow to be taken seriously.  The satire never really connects with anything, because it isn't sure what it's aiming at.  And while the script does raise the occasional smile, I couldn't really find a level to enjoy the drama on.  Consider me unamazed.",2,"No, Prime Minister",1193184000,"10 24, 2007",2007,4908,"['think', 'biggest', 'problem', 'had', 'THE', 'AMAZING', 'MRS.', 'PRITCHARD', 'even', 'viewing', 'six', 'episodes',

1051309,A2SW560X584UEF,B000MV8Z9K,Barbara B.,"[2, 3]","I am a big fan of Jane Horrocks after seeing her in both AbFab and the wonderful film, Little Voice (you HAVE to see that one!). Her talents were just as strong as ever in this show, as were the performances of most of the other cast members.However, as other reviewers have noted, there are a few major flaws that resulted in a disappointing experience.What started out as an interesting and humorous political satire (and a good one!) quickly devolved into a soap opera of personal problems, family squabbles, and unlikely crises. It was as thought they were trying to throw everything -- including the kitchen sink -- into the mix right from the start. They needed to focus on selected elements, and explore those in more depth.The biggest flaw, however, is the ending. I found out later that the actual last episode was supposed to be a season ending ""cliffhanger"" but when the series wasn't renewed, they tacked on some text screens to summarize the plot ending. UGH.  I can't blame them -- what else could they do?

Niedt,"[1, 2]","Ros Pritchard is a middle-class wife, mum, and superstore manager from Yorkshire who decides one day that she could do a better job representing the people than the two brawling candidates outside her store's entrance.  So she forms her own party and runs a straight-talking campaign in the general election, with no other credentials than her political naivet&eacute;, a goodly amount of pluck, and a desire for change.  Before she knows it, she is swept up in a groundswell of grass-roots support, straight into 10 Downing Street.  Of course there is a lot of resentment from the old guard - how could this cheeky novice be elected Prime Minister?  She's proven her point, they say, so it's time to hand over the reins to the ""real"" politicians.  But Ros has other ideas.What starts out as a captivating political fairy tale quickly evolves into an engrossing miniseries that deftly balances ""West Wing""-style behind-the-scenes drama with the trials of personal and family life, especially how all this affects Ros' husband and two daughters.  Mrs. Pritchard is indeed a reluctant PM at first, ducking out on her first night in London to sneak back home, and telling the Queen she's not sure she really wants the job.  (Her Majesty responds, in essence, ""You're stuck with it, honey!"")  But her personal growth in the position becomes evident as she deals with some early international crises, domestic policy wrangling, and personal issues, like the embarrassing appearance of her 19-year-old daughter's larger-than-life bare-bummed image, and her husband's shady past business dealings.  Things get to be a bit ""soapy"" as the series progresses, but the subplots also highlight the insidious nature of political scandal which can creep into the most well-meaning of administrations.As one would expect from a BBC production, the whole miniseries is well-acted and smartly written, with just the right balance of drama, humor and pathos.  Jane Horrocks is a gem as the petite but feisty Mrs. Pritchard, and Janet McTeer brings an icy intensity to her role as Chancellor Catherine Walker.  The rest of the cast is top-notch as well.  While some of the nuances of the British electoral system and political hierarchy may be lost on American viewers, the story - full of both family drama and political intrigue - has more than enough familiar elements to make for satisfying viewing.

1051312,AFLPMS5K3DZL5,B000MV8Z9K,calmly,"[4, 6]","Wow, I was expecting a low-budget situation comedy on the order of ""Are You Being Served?"" Not that I didn't enjoy ""Are You Being Served"" reruns but this dramatic if improbable six episode mini-series (6 hours in all) was an impressive surprise.The level of acting is outstanding. Jane Horrocks as Ros Pritchard, Janet McTeer as Catherine, Jodhi May as Miranda, Geraldine James as Hilary, Steven MacKintosh as Ian, Carey Mulligan as Emily, it's close to being a who's who of British actresses and actors. Given the quality of the scripts by Sally Wainwright, it may seem no wonder that such high quality performers signed on...but, nevertheless, the caliber of the acting sets this miniseries apart. And it may be needed, given the improbable premise that a supermarket could take over as the Prime Minister of England and lead with so much risk-taking and such confidence, family stresses notwithstanding.Visually these episodes stand out for their brightness and clarity. Lots of effective closeups but also a variety of uncluttered scenes in London and elsewhere: definitely not a one or two room show, although #10 Downing Street, understandably, figures prominently.Although comedic at times and in ways, plenty of drama unfolds which test Ros's husband Ian and her older daughter Emily in ways one could not have imagined when the series begins. Each episode is packed with activity, some of it sudden and unexpected; you'll definitely want to pause viewing if you can't watch for even a brief time so as not to miss anything. I wasn't bored for a moment. I was eager to watch through all the episodes. Shows like this don't appear often: if they did, I'd watch television a great deal more than I do...and not public television's BBC reruns! How is it that the British can produce such fine show?Although violence is not an issue with these episodes, for U.S. audiences profanity may be. Ros, Ian, and their children are not adverse to letting loose with some choice words. And the fact of menstruation isn't avoided.But none of this seems unrealistic.Would such a start to the global warming issue as Ros conceives really work? It's a refreshing idea to think that it might. Certainly professional politicians seem to be leading us to catastrophe on environmental issues so this is indeed one area in which an amateur's approach might be welcome.Although it is hard for me to pick a standout from such a cast, Janet McTeer as Catherine, the Chancellor, was one. I hadn't seen this Golden Globe winning, Academy Award nominated actress before but I will notice her henceforth. Her character develops as no other, save Emily, in the series. Another standout was Jodhi May, who was the youngest recipient of the best actress award at the Cannes Film Festival for a 1988 performance (and didn't stop there whether on television, stage or screen). But the caliber of acting is remarkably even in all the performances.Yes, it is all improbable. And how could someone withstand such stresses  even if just in the family (to the extent a Prime Minister could notice) let alone the national and international political challenges. However, Ros's Purple Alliance Party is refreshing, providing at the least great role models (for the most part) for young women. Not as light as it may seem at first, this is the kind of television show that would make television worth watching again.",5,Acting at this high level is uncommon,1191024000,"09 29, 2007",2007,3382,"['Wow', 'was', 'expecting', 'low-budget', 'situation', 'comedy', 'order', 'Are', 'Being', 'Served', 'Not', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'Are', 'Being', 'Served', 'reruns', 'dramatic', 'improbable', 'six', 'episode', 'mini-series', '6', 'hours', 'was', 'impressive', 'surprise.The', 'level', 'acting', 'outstanding', 'Jane', 'Horrocks', 'Ros', 'Pritchard', 'Janet', 'McTeer', 'Catherine', 'Jodhi', 'May', 'Miranda', 'Geraldine', 'James', 'Hilary', 'Steven', 'MacKintosh', 'Ian', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'Emily', 'close', 'being', 'who', 'who', 'British', 'actresses', 'actors', 'Given', 'quality', 'scripts', 'Sally', 'Wainwright', 'may', 'seem', 'wonder', 'such', 'high', 'quality', 'performers', 'signed', 'nevertheless', 'caliber', 'acting', 'sets', 'miniseries', 'apart', 'may', 'be', 'needed', 'given', 'improbable', 'premise', 'supermarket', 'could', 'take', 'over', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'England', 'lead', 'so', 'much', 'risk-taking', 'such', 'confidence', 'family', 'stresses', 'notwithstanding.Visually', 'episodes', 'stand', 'out', 'brightness', 'clarity', 'Lots', 'effective', 'closeups', 'also', 'variety', 'uncluttered', 'scenes', 'London', 'elsewhere', 'definitely', 'not', 'one', 'two', 'room', 'show', '10', 'Downing', 'Street', 'understandably', 'figures', 'comedic', 'times', 'ways', 'plenty', 'drama', 'unfolds', 'test', 'Ros', 'husband', 'Ian', 'older', 'daughter', 'Emily', 'ways', 'one', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'imagined', 'when', 'series', 'episode', 'packed', 'activity', 'sudden', 'unexpected', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'want', 'pause', 'viewing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'watch', 'even', 'brief', 'time', 'so', 'as', 'not', 'miss', 'anything', 'was', ""n't"", 'bored', 'moment', 'was', 'eager', 'watch', 'episodes', 'Shows', 'do', ""n't"", 'appear', 'often', 'did', ""'d"", 'watch', 'television', 'great', 'deal', 'more', 'do', 'not', 'public', 'television', 'BBC', 'How', 'British', 'can', 'produce', 'such', 'fine', 'show', 'violence', 'not', 'issue', 'episodes', 'U.S.', 'audiences', 'profanity', 'may', 'be', 'Ros', 'Ian', 'children', 'are', 'not', 'adverse', 'letting', 'loose', 'choice', 'words', 'fact', 'menstruation', ""n't"", 'avoided.But', 'none', 'unrealistic.Would', 'start', 'global', 'warming', 'issue', 'Ros', 'really', 'work', 'refreshing', 'idea', 'think', 'might', 'Certainly', 'professional', 'politicians', 'seem', 'be', 'leading', 'catastrophe', 'environmental', 'issues', 'indeed', 'one', 'area', 'amateur', 'approach', 'might', 'be', 'hard', 'pick', 'standout', 'such', 'cast', 'Janet', 'McTeer', 'Catherine', 'Chancellor', 'was', 'one', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'winning', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominated', 'actress', 'will', 'notice', 'henceforth', 'character', 'other', 'save', 'Emily', 'series', 'standout', 'was', 'Jodhi', 'May', 'who', 'was', 'youngest', 'recipient', 'best', 'actress', 'award', 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festival', '1988', 'performance', 'did', ""n't"", 'stop', 'there', 'television', 'stage', 'screen', 'caliber', 'acting', 'remarkably', 'even', 'performances.Yes', 'improbable', 'how', 'could', 'someone', 'withstand', 'such', 'stresses', 'even', 'just', 'family', 'extent', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'could', 'notice', 'let', 'alone', 'national', 'international', 'political', 'challenges', 'However', 'Ros', 'Purple', 'Alliance', 'Party', 'refreshing', 'providing', 'least', 'great', 'role', 'models', 'most', 'part', 'young', 'women', 'Not', 'as', 'light', 'may', 'seem', 'first', 'kind', 'television', 'show', 'would', 'make', 'television', 'watching', 'again']",The Amazing Mrs Pritchard

The premise that someone like Mrs. Pritchard could actually get elected requires an enormous suspension of disbelief -- and an ignorance of how the major parties in Britain operate.  If someone like Mrs. Pritchard would run on a platform that fell somewhere between the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats, the British political left would be so hopelessly divided as to ensure a Conservative shoo-in.  That's how a parliamentary democracy works.The anti-monarchist attitude portrayed (at times, rather rudely) throughout was also rather unbelievable.  In reality, the anti-monarchist movement in Britain is quite small.  There is no way ""the people"" (whomever they are supposed to be) would stand for the proposed wholesale dismantling of monarchy and tradition suggested.""Mrs. Pritchard"" also demonstrates (at least, to me) the tyranny of the radical far-left.  Once in office, Mrs. Pritchard demonstrates (or at least attempts) what is essentially government by fiat.  Whatever she wants, she forces -- all in the name of ""the people"".Virtually every significant political, economic, social, or moral issue that could have been crammed into six episodes was crammed in!

1051318,A2SRZQU1SZG4RR,B000MV8Z9K,"Erika Borsos ""pepper flower""","[1, 1]","I was hooked from the start of watching this miniseries written by Sally Wainright and starring Jane Horrocks in the lead role. It consists of 6 episodes on two DVDs, a total of approximately 354 minutes (nearly 6 hours) of viewing time. It is a satirical look at what happens when an ordinairy concerned citizen, who is fed up with ""business as usual"" of the political process, voices her opinions. A grass roots movement develops to elect her to office and before too long, she is interviewed on television programs. Kitty Porter, the wealthy owner of the grocery store chain for whom Mrs. Pritchard works as a manager, becomes one of her financial supporters. ""Politics is not rocket science"" becomes the slogan for her political party called the ""Purple Alliance"". Besides local support, Mrs. Pritchard attracts defectors from the Labour and Tory parties, such as secretaries, chancellors and ministers. She even manages to attract a famous television investigative reporter, Miranda Lennox, to become the spokes person for her political team. Something about the common sense approach that Ros takes resonates with the public, the citizens who are fed up and join her party in large numbers. One of the best scenes is when Ros Pritchard is set up to debate Catherine Walker, a famous Tory MP (Member of Parliament) on live television. Before the program, the two ladies accidentally meet in the ladies washroom, unknown to each other, and share some personal space. After looking in the mirror and realize with whom they were dealing, they exchange some well placed barbs before the actual debate. When Ros proves how well prepared she is with knowledge about Catherine's background, she adds ""Perhaps you are in the wrong party"". After which there is a pause and Catherine asks, ""Are you offering me a job?"" The rest is history ...This set of two DVDs is broken down into three episodes per DVD. Each episode connects with the previous one and builds on the story line and plot in an amusing and serious fashion. Mrs. Pritchard is elected with an overwhelming majority. Ros learns how to function in her new role and is surrounded by experienced and knowledgeable staff. Yet Ros is still debating her abilities and qualifications when she is summoned to meet the Queen. The Queen reassures her that everything will not come to a grinding halt based on your decisions. She receives a congratulatory phone call from President Bush and makes a political faux pas. She wants to distance herself from the supportive position which Tony Blair took regarding the war in Iraq. However, she is faced with a conundrum, several French soldiers were shot down in Irag and President Chiraq of France is asking for British help. Ros provides Britain's ally with help, knowing it places embedded British soldiers at risk if they are captured. Ros had promised the British people two things, 1) she will never lie and 2) she will never mislead them. However, unknown to her, Kitty has paid off several people to keep silent about a secret matter which involved Ros' husband, which may later come to haunt Ros. Although, Ros knew nothing about it, if it were made public, by default she would have to resign as Prime Minister.On the second DVD, Ros has now been in office as Prime Minister for one full year. She has grown into the job but continues to make occasional off the cuff remarks during interviews which drives her Chancellor of Financial Affairs absolutely crazy. Any such pronouncements are publicly viewed as offical policy which commits the government into tackling and funding particular projects with serious implications. One such project is ""Green Wednesday"" which supports Britain''s commitment to using less fossil fuel and decreasing energy consumption as signed in the Kyoto Agreements. There could be serious backlashes from this project which the Prime Minister did not consider. As it turned out, it became an overwhelming success and a great example for all of Europe. Along with huge successes, Ros also faces politically explosive crises. One is when an airplane crash thought to be caused by a terrorist attack turns out to be from air safety negligence. A British official failed to represent  British interests during a European Union meeting and had signed a Directive which lowered the safety standards of airlines. Ros managed to skirt this near political disaster and remain unscathed and unmarred. However, there is a skeleton lurking in her closet which could cause her downfall. She is unaware of her husband's participation in a cover-up activity fifteen years ago at the firm where he worked and that it is about to be exposed. I love how the writers build suspense and drama into each episode as new problems arise for the inexperienced Prime Minister to work out. She faces near disasters with courage and integrity and in the end must deal with the most difficult one of all involving her husband. One must view the entire miniseries to fully appreciate how Ros Pritchard develops into the role of Prime Minister and how her basic instincts provide her with political savvy and survival skills. This whole miniseries is a thoroughly enjoyable and riveting viewing experience.

1051320,A2BDZAU0Y4J6NB,B000MV8Z9K,F. S. L'hoir,"[3, 5]","Simply Amazing!Within the first few minutes, this splendidly-acted television series hooked me! A combination of political thriller, suspense yarn, and comedy in the best sense of the word, the story about a spunky but ordinary super-market manager, wife, and mother, who thinks she can do a better job in parliament than the ""more-of-the-same"" politicians in Westminster--and then gets enough votes and women supporters on board to form a government--made me feel not only good but also empowered. Jane Horrocks is delightful in the title role; the rest of the cast (whose names I cannot tell you because Acorn Media did not feel it necessary to supply them; and the print on the end credits was too small) is outstanding (We've seen them all before on various Masterpiece Theatre productions, including ""Jewel in the Crown"" and ""Daniel Deronda."") [Exception: After watching the show on PBS, I finally learned the name of the magnificent Janet McTeer who plays the Chancellor of the Exchecquer to perfection!].The story of how the women can do a better job of running the government than the men is the Greek comic playwright Aristophanes' ""Lysistrata"" and ""The Assemblywomen"" in modern dress, and just as much fun. One of my favorite moments is when Mrs. Pritchard rings up Tony Blair at 3:00 A.M. to ask where the secret exit is from #10 (Downing Street) so she can get away from the non-stop scrutiny that goes with the office of Prime Minister (Of course, now she would be ringing up Gordon Brown.).Some American viewers may not understand Mrs. Pritchard's Leeds accent at first (and Acorn Media, as usual, supplies no English--or any other--subtitles). It took some adjusting of my ears before I got used to it, and I listen to the BBC every night. But it is worth persisting. I must say, I learned so much about how a majority leader is elected and how a government is formed in the UK from watching this series, which also paints a vivid picture of how the Prime Minister is besieged with appointments from morning to night. I found these details absorbing. And, at the same time, the story is so solid, that my attention did not flag for one second.If you enjoyed ""House of Cards,"" you will enjoy the amazing Mrs. Pritchard (who is the perfect antidote for Francis Urquhart).At any rate, Mrs. Pritchard gets my vote!",5,The Amazing Mrs. Pritchard is . . .,1191369600,"10 3, 2007",2007,2325,"['Simply', 'Amazing', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'splendidly-acted', 'television', 'series', 'hooked', 'combination', 'political', 'thriller', 'suspense', 'yarn', 'comedy', 'best', 'sense', 'word', 'story', 'spunky', 'ordinary', 'super-market', 'manager', 'wife', 'mother', 'who', 'can', 'do', 'better', 'job', 'parliament', 'more-of-the-same', 'politicians', 'Westminster', 'then', 'enough', 'votes', 'women', 'supporters', 'board', 'form', 'government', 'made', 'feel', 'not', 'only', 'good', 'also', 'empowered', 'Jane', 'Horrocks', 'delightful', 'title', 'role', 'rest', 'cast', 'names', 'can', 'not', 'tell', 'Acorn', 'Media', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'necessary', 'supply', 'print', 'end', 'credits', 'was', 'too', 'small', 'outstanding', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'various', 'Masterpiece', 'Theatre', 'productions', 'including', 'Jewel', 'Crown', 'Daniel', 'Deronda', '[', 'Exception', 'watching', 'show', 'PBS', 'finally', 'learned', 'name', 'magnificent', 'Janet', 'McTeer', 'who', 'Chancellor', 'Exchecquer', 'perfection', ']', '.The', 'story', 'how', 'women', 'can', 'do', 'better', 'job', 'running', 'government', 'men', 'Greek', 'comic', 'playwright', 'Aristophanes', 'Lysistrata', 'Assemblywomen', 'modern', 'dress', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'fun', 'One', 'favorite', 'moments', 'when', 'Mrs.', 'Pritchard', 'up', 'Tony', 'Blair', '3:00', 'A.M.', 'ask', 'where', 'secret', 'exit', '10', 'Downing', 'Street', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'non-stop', 'scrutiny', 'office', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'course', 'now', 'would', 'be', 'ringing', 'up', 'Gordon', 'Brown', '.Some', 'American', 'viewers', 'may', 'not', 'understand', 'Mrs.', 'Pritchard', 'Leeds', 'accent', 'first', 'Acorn', 'Media', 'usual', 'English', 'other', 'subtitles', 'took', 'adjusting', 'ears', 'got', 'used', 'listen', 'BBC', 'night', 'worth', 'persisting', 'must', 'say', 'learned', 'so', 'much', 'how', 'majority', 'leader', 'elected', 'how', 'government', 'formed', 'UK', 'watching', 'series', 'also', 'vivid', 'picture', 'how', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'besieged', 'appointments', 'morning', 'night', 'found', 'details', 'absorbing', 'same', 'time', 'story', 'so', 'solid', 'attention', 'did', 'not', 'flag', 'one', 'second.If', 'enjoyed', 'House', 'Cards', 'will', 'enjoy', 'amazing', 'Mrs.', 'Pritchard', 'who', 'perfect', 'antidote', 'Francis', 'Urquhart', 'rate', 'Mrs.', 'Pritchard', 'vote']",The Amazing Mrs Pritchard

Of course, you do have to cross the big pond as this is a British drama but the idea is  much the same.In this case, the upstart is, of course, Ros  Pritchard, a super market manager who is up to her blond bob in the empty promises politicos make.  Then, when two candidates start brawling in front of her market, that cuts it.  She says that she could do better than they  and sets about doing it, mainly as she puts it ""To prove a point.""Well, she more than proves her point as she enlists a number of ardent followers, even wins over some powerful politicians, and her Purple Alliance Party is on the move.  Things aren't that positive on the home front as husband, Ian, begs her not to continue.  He has a few secrets he'd rather not have made public.  Their two daughters, the beauteous Emily and bespectacled Georgina are a bit more compliant.It will come as little surprise to viewers that she wins the election and as Prime Minister-elect goes about forming a new government, rewarding the strong women who have stood beside her.  She is barely in office when deadly serious issues arise and she has to make decisions that she believes are totally beyond her realm.  However, self-doubt doesn't stem what is evidently her inexhaustible store of ideas, and she even suggests that Parliament be moved to Bradford.For this viewer the series peaked with Ros's election.  What follows is a series of more personal problems - Emily posing for a boy's magazine, Ian's secrets coming to light, and one of Ros's cohorts having an abortion.Jane Horrocks turns in an outstanding performance as Ros Pritchard, and she is surrounded by a fine supporting cast.

The result was a whopping first week followed by a Nielsen plunge to the bottom of the charts. Perhaps America was not yet ready for a female President, but more likely the writing was so ham-handed that the essence of the character was lost.Britain is used to female leaders. It had an Iron Lady, Mrs Thatcher as Prime Minister and of course it has a queen. But Britain also has the BBC which must have looked at Commander-in-Chief and sworn not to repeat its mistakes.Mrs. Pritchard is delightful. She is a supermarket manager who breaks up a fight between too opposing male pols, and announces the she could do better than either of the brawlers. She stirs up a ground swell of female support on both sides of the aisles in Parliament and coasts to an overwhelming victory. although her first hour in office is marked with an Iranian hostage crisis, she remains devoted to the new ideas that the public demands.

Jane Horrock did an excellent job with this part.  To rise from a place of obscurity to being Prime Minister of the nation of Great Britain was refreshing!  She is definitely, politically naive and way out of her depth, however, her cabinet is made up of some very fascinating characters, who are more knowledgable about politics than Mrs Pritchard. Janet McTeer turned in a first class performance. Interesting to see how she reacts to her political mistakes, how real she is when she has to make a decision where lives might be at stake. We also see in this series how Mrs. Pritchard's passion to serve her country has its' affect on her family.

1051325,A3A6GXILVT9JNW,B000MV8Z9K,Jeanne Tassotto,"[1, 4]","When asked this question Ros Pritchard (Jane Horrocks) responded with ""Yes, I think I could""  and started a chain of events that ultimately lead this wife, mother and supermarket manager from her home in the north of England to 10 Downing Street.  Her dissatisfaction with chosing between the lesser of two evils at the polling place struck a chord with British voters who turned her candidacy-as-protest-gesture into a grassroots movements that swept the country.  Once elected (an occurance that took Ros and her family totally by surprise) she found herself in a position that she had no preparation for, one that she only vaguely understood.  Ros quickly discovered that this was not a position that she could not just step away from too many were depending on her and Ros was nothing if not dependable.The series opens with Ros entering politics and continues through the next couple of years of time in office.  We see her grow from well meaning housewife and store manager into a polished, determined leader.  This is a rather large cast with quite a few story lines.  In addition to Ros, her husband and daughters there are various members of her government, all of whom have their own issues and stories, which is a bit of a challenge for the viewer to keep track of who is who and all their various story lines.The series was apparently intended to have at least a second season but was abandoned due to low ratings.  Too bad because this is an example of something British TV does so well, taking the current world and giving it a bit of a twist to create a totally plausible alternate reality.  Another strength common with British TV is the strong acting.  Most of the cast has appeared in various other productions with which the viewer will probably be familiar.  The most astonishing, at least to this viewer, was the main character, Ros (Jane Horrocks) - aka the airheaded Bubble from AbFab - as the Prime Minister!?There are a few problems with this otherwise excellent show.  On the technical side the opening episode had a couple of sceens with a very annoyingly shaky camera and background music that nearly drowned out the dialog.  American viewers will also be left a bit confused by the British Parliamentary system and that many of the senior government officals seem to live in government supplied residences at or near 10 Downing Street.

1051326,A8MZA6YR9UAN9,B000MV8Z9K,JET,"[3, 5]","I love British television, but hadn't heard about this series prior to receiving it through the Amazon Vine program. I wasn't sure what to expect, although the premise sounded interesting. Without giving too much away, The Amazing Mrs. Pritchard is about Mrs. Pritchard (Jane Horrocks - in a much different role from her other fantastic roles in Absolutely Fabulous and Little Voice), a superstore manager who becomes fed up with politics and decides to make a point by joining the race herself. What she does not expect is that what she has to say inspires others to run on the same platform, revolutionizing politics. In short, Mrs. Pritchard creates her own party, wins by a landslide, and becomes prime minister. Although part of her allure is that she knows nothing about politics, she has to learn about politics sometime, and the show follows her acclimatization and the pain of making life and death decisions and being held responsible for the outcomes. It is also not entirely about Mrs. Pritchard; the show is also about the effect of all of this on her family, including the strain on her marriage and several scandals involving her husband and eldest daughter that threaten her position.As I said above, this is vastly different from Horrocks's other roles, but she retains her likability and quick-wittedness. Mrs. Pritchard is engaging, smart, and fresh. There are plenty of other strong characters as well, including Mrs. Pritchard's daughters and her Chancellor of the Exchequer, Catherine. The premise of the series itself is inspiring, fascinating, and intelligent.Before watching this series, I did a little research, and I believe this is, so far, the only episodes that have been produced. It was unsure, on a fan Web site, whether the series would continue. I do hope it does, as although I didn't find this series quite as addicting as MI-5 (known in the U.K. as Spooks), I couldn't stop watching to find out what Mrs. Pritchard did next.",5,Inspiring Series about British Politics,1190505600,"09 23, 2007",2007,1962,"['love', 'British', 'television', 'had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'series', 'prior', 'receiving', 'Amazon', 'Vine', 'program', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'premise', 'sounded', 'interesting', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'Amazing', 'Mrs.', 'Pritchard', 'Mrs.', 'Pritchard', 'Jane', 'Horrocks', 'much', 'different', 'role', 'other', 'fantastic', 'roles', 'Absolutely', 'Fabulous', 'Little', 'Voice', 'superstore', 'manager', 'who', 'fed', 'up', 'politics', 'decides', 'make', 'point', 'joining', 'race', 'What', 'not', 'expect', 'what', 'say', 'inspires', 'others', 'run', 'same', 'platform', 'revolutionizing', 'politics', 'short', 'Mrs.', 'Pritchard', 'own', 'party', 'wins', 'landslide', 'prime', 'minister', 'part', 'allure', 'nothing', 'politics', 'learn', 'politics', 'sometime', 'show', 'acclimatization', 'pain', 'making', 'life', 'death', 'decisions', 'being', 'held', 'responsible', 'outcomes', 'also', 'not', 'entirely', 'Mrs.', 'Pritchard', 'show', 'also', 'effect', 'family', 'including', 'strain', 'marriage', 'several', 'scandals', 'involving', 'husband', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'position.As', 'said', 'above', 'vastly', 'different', 'Horrocks', 'other', 'roles', 'likability', 'quick-wittedness', 'Mrs.', 'Pritchard', 'engaging', 'smart', 'fresh', 'are', 'plenty', 'other', 'strong', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'including', 'Mrs.', 'Pritchard', 'daughters', 'Chancellor', 'Exchequer', 'Catherine', 'premise', 'series', 'inspiring', 'fascinating', 'intelligent.Before', 'watching', 'series', 'did', 'little', 'research', 'believe', 'so', 'far', 'only', 'have', 'been', 'produced', 'was', 'unsure', 'fan', 'Web', 'site', 'series', 'would', 'continue', 'do', 'hope', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'series', 'quite', 'as', 'addicting', 'MI-5', 'known', 'U.K.', 'Spooks', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'watching', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'Mrs.', 'Pritchard', 'did', 'next']",The Amazing Mrs Pritchard

It's election time, and Ros is sick of the candidates on both sides. On a whim, she fills out election papers and stands for MP.  What began as a joke begins to take on a life of its own; she forms a new party and before you know it, she's the new Prime Minister.  Life at No. 10 isn't all glamour and tea parties with the Queen however; Ros is in meetings from morning till night and hasn't time to notice her husband is drinking too much, her older daughter is acting out in troublesome ways, and her younger daughter is feeling neglected.The story begins as a lightweight comedy about woman-power, then takes a serious turn as a political drama, and ends up as a soap opera (my favorite part), dealing with Ros' family troubles and those of her top staff.  The secret her husband has been hiding for years threatens to destroy the family, while her best friend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, is having a rocky relationship with a man half her age.Unfortunately, Jane Horrocks (Ros) failed to engage me.  She wasn't charismatic enough to make me like her or care about her and wasn't ""amazing"" at all.  Ros' husband and family were a whiny, self-centered lot.  The ""Women Can Do Anything Better Than Men"" storyline was heavy-handed and monotonous.  The one performance I thoroughly enjoyed was that of Janet McTeer as the Chancellor.

John Kenneth Galbraith.""The Amazing Mrs. Pritchard"", played admirably by Jane Horrocks, seeks to prove Galbraith wrong when a she decides to return for Parliament as an independent candidate.  The result is an entertaining 6-hour BBC mini-series.British television (including the BBC, ITV, and Channel 4) has set the bar very high for television shows with a political theme.Yes Minister - The Complete CollectionandYes, Prime Minister - The Complete Collectionwere brilliant comedies.A Very British Coupwas a wonderfully dark, dystopian look at a Labour Government at odds with the `power elite'.House of Cards Trilogy (House of Cards / To Play the King / The Final Cut)was a savage (but humorous) look at the rise to power of the devilishly Machiavellian Francis Urquhart (known to all as F.U.) as he clawed his way to the office of Prime Minister.  The bar is set very high for ""The Amazing Mrs. Pritchard"" so to say that it doesn't quite live up the very best British political series is not to say it isn't worth watching.  On the contrary, this was an entertaining series.The story is set up when the very efficient and likeable supermarket manager Mrs. Pritchard witnesses a very public and very juvenile quarrel in front of her store between the Labour and Conservative Party candidates for Parliament during a general election campaign.  No sooner does Mrs. Pritchard break up the fight then she claims that she could do better than that lot.  The remark is picked up by the press and the next thing you know Mrs. Pritchard is not only standing for a seat in Parliament but becomes the leader of a grass-roots third party, ""the Purple Alliance"".  By the end of the first episode she is elected to office and the Purple Alliance finds itself in power.  This first episode does a very nice job in making this whole thing seem plausible - no mean feat.  The rest of the first series of episodes (disc 1) takes Pritchard through her first, tumultuous year in office.  The second series of episodes (disc 2) finds her firmly in power after a year but facing a series of family and political crisis that threaten both her party and her personal beliefs.There are both strengths and weaknesses in the acting.  The strengths are in the `political' cast.  Jane Horrocks (Little VoiceandAbsolutely Fabulous - Complete Series 1-3) is very good as Mrs. Prichard.  Johdi May (Tipping the Velvet) does an excellent job of portraying Pritchard's Chief of Staff.  Last but not least, Janet McTeer does a  superb job as the Purple Alliance's Chancellor of the Exchequer.  In fact, McTeer's performance is probably the highlight of the series and actually tends to overshadow Horrocks whenever they have a scene together.The weaknesses are found in the casting of Pritchard's family.  Both Steven Mckintosh as Mr. Pritchard and Carey Mulligan as their troubled daughter Emily left me cold.  Further, the story line involving the family crisis struck me as more suited to a soap opera than a BBC production.Bottom line: There is a lot to like in ""The Amazing Mrs. Pritchard"" but the political story line is a bit weighed down by the family story line.  All in all - this is well worth watching and probably better than what you are likely to find on the television set on any given evening.  Although it doesn't quite live up to the expectations of some of the best British political series exported to the U.S. it was still an enjoyable series.",3,"""Politics is not the art of the possible",1191888000,"10 9, 2007",2007,3505,"['choosing', 'disastrous', 'unpalatable', 'John', 'Kenneth', 'Galbraith', 'Amazing', 'Mrs.', 'Pritchard', 'played', 'admirably', 'Jane', 'Horrocks', 'prove', 'Galbraith', 'wrong', 'when', 'return', 'Parliament', 'independent', 'candidate', 'result', 'entertaining', '6-hour', 'BBC', 'mini-series.British', 'television', 'including', 'BBC', 'ITV', 'Channel', '4', 'set', 'bar', 'very', 'high', 'television', 'shows', 'political', 'theme.Yes', 'Minister', 'Complete', 'CollectionandYes', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Complete', 'Collectionwere', 'brilliant', 'comedies.A', 'Very', 'British', 'Coupwas', 'wonderfully', 'dark', 'dystopian', 'look', 'Labour', 'Government', 'odds', 'power', ""elite'.House"", 'Cards', 'Trilogy', 'House', 'Cards', '/', 'Play', 'King', 'Final', 'Cut', 'was', 'savage', 'humorous', 'look', 'rise', 'power', 'devilishly', 'Machiavellian', 'Francis', 'Urquhart', 'known', 'F.U', 'clawed', 'way', 'office', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'bar', 'set', 'very', 'high', 'Amazing', 'Mrs.', 'Pritchard', 'say', ""n't"", 'quite', 'live', 'up', 'very', 'best', 'British', 'political', 'series', 'not', 'say', ""n't"", 'worth', 'watching', 'contrary', 'was', 'entertaining', 'series.The', 'story', 'set', 'up', 'when', 'very', 'efficient', 'likeable', 'supermarket', 'manager', 'Mrs.', 'Pritchard', 'very', 'public', 'very', 'juvenile', 'quarrel', 'front', 'store', 'Labour', 'Conservative', 'Party', 'candidates', 'Parliament', 'general', 'election', 'campaign', 'sooner', 'Mrs.', 'Pritchard', 'break', 'up', 'fight', 'then', 'could', 'do', 'better', 'lot', 'remark', 'picked', 'up', 'press', 'next', 'thing', 'know', 'Mrs.', 'Pritchard', 'not', 'only', 'standing', 'seat', 'Parliament', 'leader', 'grass-roots', 'third', 'party', 'Purple', 'Alliance', 'end', 'first', 'episode', 'elected', 'office', 'Purple', 'Alliance', 'power', 'first', 'episode', 'very', 'nice', 'job', 'making', 'whole', 'thing', 'seem', 'plausible', 'mean', 'feat', 'rest', 'first', 'series', 'episodes', 'disc', '1', 'Pritchard', 'first', 'tumultuous', 'year', 'office', 'second', 'series', 'episodes', 'disc', '2', 'firmly', 'power', 'year', 'facing', 'series', 'family', 'political', 'crisis', 'party', 'personal', 'beliefs.There', 'are', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'acting', 'strengths', 'are', 'political', 'cast', 'Jane', 'Horrocks', 'Little', 'VoiceandAbsolutely', 'Fabulous', 'Complete', 'Series', '1-3', 'very', 'good', 'Mrs.', 'Prichard', 'Johdi', 'May', 'Tipping', 'Velvet', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'Pritchard', 'Chief', 'Staff', 'Last', 'not', 'least', 'Janet', 'McTeer', 'superb', 'job', 'Purple', 'Alliance', 'Chancellor', 'Exchequer', 'fact', 'McTeer', 'performance', 'probably', 'highlight', 'series', 'actually', 'overshadow', 'Horrocks', 'whenever', 'have', 'scene', 'together.The', 'weaknesses', 'are', 'found', 'casting', 'Pritchard', 'family', 'Steven', 'Mckintosh', 'Mr.', 'Pritchard', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'troubled', 'daughter', 'Emily', 'left', 'cold', 'Further', 'story', 'line', 'involving', 'family', 'crisis', 'struck', 'more', 'suited', 'soap', 'opera', 'BBC', 'production.Bottom', 'line', 'lot', 'like', 'Amazing', 'Mrs.', 'Pritchard', 'political', 'story', 'line', 'bit', 'weighed', 'down', 'family', 'story', 'line', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'probably', 'better', 'what', 'are', 'likely', 'find', 'television', 'set', 'given', 'evening', ""n't"", 'quite', 'live', 'up', 'expectations', 'best', 'British', 'political', 'series', 'exported', 'U.S.', 'was', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'series']",The Amazing Mrs Pritchard

The acting is good and the storyline interesting but it wears a little thin.  The plot was appealing with an ordinary woman getting tired of the same old politics and when voicing her discontent becomes a candidate herself.  This was brillant and I liked where the series was going as we followed her ride from a working mother (store manager) to the big time playing with the big boys.  The portrayal of the inner sactum of british politics was not fascinating enough to keep my attention.  Most of the characters lacked depth, in my opinion, and were too flat to evoke any emotional bond.  This was especially true for lead character (played by Jane Horricks, a great actress).  The added family issues (wandering husband with long ago illicit affair? and rebellious daughter) while interesting, just made it a soap opera not a political drama.A friend from London tells me this series was not a huge hit in the UK so I'm wondering why it was released in the US?

This isn't your typical realistic drama about a Labour party leader, rather, how someone has made it to the highest point of government from absolutely nothing.It is interesting to see how the characters, most notably Mrs. Pritchard, have defied political logic and eroded the political stereotypes of untruthfulness and circumlocution. The series clearly portrays that politics isn't an easy game -- despite certain US leaders that try to portray that image.Face it that American TV as of late has nothing really original. We've got plenty of CSI and Law and Order clones and few worthwhile sitcoms. Dramas don't really delve into the societal issues we face today. The Amazing Mrs. Pritchard, for the most part, does. There's humor and the many awe-shocking moments (especially in the first episode of the series.)

1051332,A1WXG10FJ353K0,B000MV8Z9K,MickeyJoe,"[1, 1]","I adore Jane Horrocks, and even more now for her efforts shown here.  Being in the US, we miss out on a lot of UK talent.  Be it recording artists or actors, they never get the exposure they deserve.  Jane is one of those talents, two-fold.Those that don't know who Jane Horrocks is may recall her from ""Absolutely Fabulous - Complete Series 1-3"", but still not major exposure for her.  Her most brilliant film, ""Little Voice"", shows her vocal talents and how she can channel Billie Holiday and Judy Garland with eerie results.  I highly suggest the soundtrack, as well asJane Horrocks - The Further Adventures of Little Voice.  Fans of Robbie Williams can hear duets together on both of their cds.With The Amazing Mrs. Pritchard, we see Jane in a different light.  In a US mentality, think ""Desperate Houswives"" meets ""The West Wing"".  You really don't know what to expect with this mini-series, and I watched all six hours in one sitting.  There are humorous and impossible elements, but also serious current events delivered with great emotion.  A very well rounded production.We meet Mrs. Pritchard as a Manager in an over-staffed grocery store.  Basically the best Boss you could ever have, and too good to be true.  Unfortunately, there is so much going on in the first 30 minutes, you really have to pay attention to the thin character development.  You are basically getting a taste of what's to come, but after the first half hour, the drama begins. You are then overloaded with a complete political campaign all the way to her becoming Prime Minister ... all in one episode.We eventually get to know the characters in depth.  Mrs. Pritchard knows nothing about politics, and basically ran for office to prove a point.  She does not expect to get anywhere, and just wanted to ruffle some feathers.  Surrounding herself with people who know what to do is the only way she gets through it.  However, she ultimately wins the hearts of the country, and wins the election by a landslide.  It did not come without scandal attempts at trying to bring this housewife's reputation down, but not being in politics to begin with, made it hard for them to do.Dirt does eventually come up in the family, and some additional dirt is created by greed. But Mrs. Pritchard is always keeping it all together as best she can.  It's an interesting take on women in power. Seeing her bring her fellow female friends into her cabinet is just refreshing.  If anything, it makes a case that a woman should be running America at this point.The new Prime Minister is not surrounded by all light-hearted fluff.  Her first day included making decisions she will hold with her the rest of her life.  Efforts to connect with other Presidential names early on, go terribly wrong.  And outside attempts to bring her down persist to the point of seeing power she never knew she had.  She never thought she would be where she was, never thought she could do it, and never thought about dealing with Bush.The show is set at the time when Tony Blair was being replaced.  Blair is  a phone call away for anything she needs, but when she has to meet the Queen, she breaks down her reality of fear.  What follows is surprising, and exciting.I only wish it were a complete series, and not a six episode mini-series.  There are great characters that are rushed and could be elaborated.  But, I still give it five stars for the outstanding acting of all involved, and the superb camera work.As far as the packaging and physical DVD aspects, it is fair at best.  There are only two DVDs, so they could have simply been put in a normal 2 disc case.  But there are two full size cases, and a sleeve.  A sleeve with no information on cast or production.  There is a sheet inside, but with nothing of valued information.  The DVDs themselves do not contain any extras and offer nothing but the six episodes.  With that said, the content could have been put on one disc.  But, I cannot hold any of the cosmetics against the production.BBC did a great job on a great mini-series.",5,See Jane Run A Country,1191456000,"10 4, 2007",2007,4039,"['adore', 'Jane', 'Horrocks', 'even', 'more', 'now', 'efforts', 'shown', 'here', 'Being', 'US', 'miss', 'out', 'lot', 'UK', 'talent', 'Be', 'recording', 'artists', 'actors', 'never', 'get', 'exposure', 'deserve', 'Jane', 'one', 'talents', 'two-fold.Those', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'Jane', 'Horrocks', 'may', 'recall', 'Absolutely', 'Fabulous', 'Complete', 'Series', '1-3', 'still', 'not', 'major', 'exposure', 'most', 'brilliant', 'film', 'Little', 'Voice', 'vocal', 'talents', 'how', 'can', 'channel', 'Billie', 'Holiday', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'eerie', 'results', 'highly', 'suggest', 'soundtrack', 'as', 'well', 'Horrocks', 'Further', 'Adventures', 'Little', 'Voice', 'Fans', 'Robbie', 'Williams', 'can', 'hear', 'duets', 'together', 'cds.With', 'Amazing', 'Mrs.', 'Pritchard', 'see', 'Jane', 'different', 'light', 'US', 'mentality', 'think', 'Desperate', 'Houswives', 'West', 'Wing', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'mini-series', 'watched', 'six', 'hours', 'one', 'sitting', 'are', 'humorous', 'impossible', 'elements', 'also', 'serious', 'current', 'events', 'delivered', 'great', 'emotion', 'very', 'well', 'rounded', 'production.We', 'meet', 'Mrs.', 'Pritchard', 'Manager', 'over-staffed', 'grocery', 'store', 'Basically', 'best', 'could', 'ever', 'have', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'true', 'Unfortunately', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'really', 'have', 'pay', 'attention', 'thin', 'character', 'development', 'are', 'basically', 'getting', 'taste', 'what', 'come', 'first', 'half', 'hour', 'drama', 'are', 'then', 'overloaded', 'complete', 'political', 'campaign', 'way', 'becoming', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'one', 'episode.We', 'eventually', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'depth', 'Mrs.', 'Pritchard', 'nothing', 'politics', 'basically', 'ran', 'office', 'prove', 'point', 'not', 'expect', 'get', 'anywhere', 'just', 'wanted', 'ruffle', 'feathers', 'Surrounding', 'people', 'who', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'only', 'way', 'However', 'ultimately', 'hearts', 'country', 'election', 'landslide', 'did', 'not', 'come', 'scandal', 'attempts', 'trying', 'bring', 'housewife', 'reputation', 'down', 'not', 'being', 'politics', 'begin', 'made', 'hard', 'do.Dirt', 'eventually', 'come', 'up', 'family', 'additional', 'dirt', 'created', 'greed', 'Mrs.', 'Pritchard', 'always', 'keeping', 'together', 'best', 'can', 'interesting', 'take', 'women', 'power', 'Seeing', 'bring', 'fellow', 'female', 'friends', 'cabinet', 'just', 'refreshing', 'anything', 'case', 'woman', 'should', 'be', 'running', 'America', 'point.The', 'new', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'not', 'surrounded', 'light-hearted', 'fluff', 'first', 'day', 'included', 'making', 'decisions', 'will', 'hold', 'rest', 'life', 'Efforts', 'connect', 'other', 'Presidential', 'names', 'early', 'go', 'terribly', 'wrong', 'outside', 'attempts', 'bring', 'down', 'persist', 'point', 'seeing', 'power', 'never', 'knew', 'had', 'never', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'where', 'was', 'never', 'thought', 'could', 'do', 'never', 'thought', 'dealing', 'Bush.The', 'show', 'set', 'time', 'when', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'was', 'being', 'replaced', 'Blair', 'phone', 'call', 'away', 'anything', 'when', 'meet', 'Queen', 'down', 'reality', 'fear', 'What', 'surprising', 'only', 'wish', 'were', 'complete', 'series', 'not', 'six', 'episode', 'mini-series', 'are', 'great', 'characters', 'are', 'rushed', 'could', 'be', 'elaborated', 'still', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'outstanding', 'acting', 'involved', 'superb', 'camera', 'work.As', 'far', 'packaging', 'physical', 'DVD', 'aspects', 'fair', 'best', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'DVDs', 'could', 'have', 'simply', 'been', 'put', 'normal', '2', 'disc', 'case', 'are', 'two', 'full', 'size', 'cases', 'sleeve', 'sleeve', 'information', 'cast', 'production', 'sheet', 'inside', 'nothing', 'valued', 'information', 'DVDs', 'do', 'not', 'contain', 'extras', 'offer', 'nothing', 'six', 'episodes', 'said', 'content', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'put', 'one', 'disc', 'can', 'not', 'hold', 'cosmetics', 'production.BBC', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'great', 'mini-series']",The Amazing Mrs Pritchard

Actually I thought all the cast was well developed except the eldest daughter. Perhaps it was simply I didn't like her character. Granted at times the situations were a bit over the top, BUT all of them really could happen. People who aren't pleased with President Bush will love the way Rose handles him. AND most will love the way the Purple Alliance gives the government back to the people. It would be wonderful if an American version were made before the 2008 presidential election. Sadly six one hour episodes left me hungry for more and I hope more will eventually follow since I think it will be hugely popular in the UK and USA. So why only four stars?

1051337,AUA64NQ3X56OJ,B000MV8Z9K,Richard Nelson,"[18, 22]","This six-hour BBC miniseries tells the story of a grocery store manager who decides, after watching two candidates for Parliament engage in fisticuffs outside her store, that she could do a better job. As luck would have it, a TV camera catches her saying so, and soon she finds herself in the middle of a whirlwind political movement. She inspires other women to run for office, and many defect from their political parties to join her. Come election day, her party wins--and she becomes prime minister. (Forgive me--I've just told you how the first hour ends.)But all is not so simple for Ros Pritchard, the titular star of the show (played with aplomb by Jane Horrocks). Her husband does not support her choice and urges her to refuse the job, fearful that his own secrets will come to light if she takes office. And within hours of her election, she faces the first of several crises that demonstrate to her that being a world leader is tougher than it looked on TV.Ros rises to the challenge, though, and for four of its six hours this miniseries is a delightful fantasy about how the world would be if ""the great British people"" got behind a leader with common-sense ideas and a desire to effect real change. Supporting players generate much of the interest, with no one's story more compelling and intriguing than that of Catherine Walker, a former Tory and now the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Catherine is the voice of wisdom and experience that Ros desperately needs, but as portrayed by the stellar Janet McTeer she is a woman with regrets that need working out, as well. Watching her work through her own issues while keeping the country running is a gripping experience.I limit myself to four of five stars because the final hour of the series goes a bit off the rails. Without giving anything away, all I dare say is that the two days depicted in the last hour proceed as if the responsibilities of government have been temporarily suspended. And Americans, used to our tidy endings, probably won't love the way the series concludes; the text at the end, which British audiences evidently did not see when the program aired on the BBC, seems to wrap things up in a bow but actually makes the conclusion less believable.Despite that, this is a fine series that anyone with an interest in politics will heartily enjoy.

I'd call it a political thriller, striving to be like House of Cards or the Politician's Wife. Reminiscent of The Candidate and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, supermarket manager Ros Pritchard enters the election as a long-shot candidate. She doesn't expect to win, she's just fed up with the usual lot of candidates. Oddly enough, voters flock to support her in droves and the owner of the supermarket chain donates ten million pounds to her campaign. What a lucky break! Eight weeks later she's won the election, and not only did she win a seat in Parliament, since her newly established Purple Party won a majority nationwide, she's the Prime Minister.The men in The Amazing Mrs. Pritchard are a spineless bunch. Her husband tells her to drop out of the election before it's too late, the other candidates resort to feeble fist fights, even the policeman who climbs the tower to save Ros's suicidal male employee ends up having a heart attack. Can't men do anything without Ros?It was at this point that I nearly gave up on the series. But then the action moves to Downing Street and becomes more political. Ros and her new cabinet (all women) have to deal with crises from the start. Ros panics and has self-doubts, but deals with one emergency after another. She has a conversation with the U.S. president where she tells him to get stuffed. (Is this a requirement for British filmmakers now? I hate George Bush as much as the next person, but I've seen that scene in enough movies now that it seems a bit too calculated.)Now the series really gets going. Ros has to learn about politics and in-fighting and power plays while dealing with one disaster after another. Meanwhile her family is having its own assortment of catastrophes. I'll admit that even after the somewhat unlikely beginning, I was completely hooked and ended up watching the entire series in two nights. Maybe I've seen Jane Horrocks (Ros Pritchard) in too many ridiculous outfits in Absolutely Fabulous, but I didn't find her entirely convincing as the Prime Minister. The rest of the cast was just perfect, though. Janet McTeer and Jodhi May were standouts, but the rest of the cast was great, too.The ending seemed a bit pasted on, and I later read that when the series was broadcast in England, it was without the explanatory titles at the end. Either way, it will have you thinking and talking about Ros's decision and the consequences.So is this a recommendation? Yes! Even if you have a few problems with it, like I did, it will keep you glued to the set to the very end.",4,"""I Could Do Better Than That Lot""",1190764800,"09 26, 2007",2007,2632,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'series', 'advertised', 'comedy', 'drama', 'comedy', 'drama', ""'d"", 'call', 'political', 'thriller', 'striving', 'be', 'House', 'Cards', 'Politician', 'Wife', 'Reminiscent', 'Candidate', 'Mr.', 'Smith', 'Goes', 'Washington', 'supermarket', 'manager', 'Ros', 'Pritchard', 'election', 'long-shot', 'candidate', ""n't"", 'expect', 'win', 'just', 'fed', 'up', 'usual', 'lot', 'candidates', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'voters', 'flock', 'support', 'droves', 'owner', 'supermarket', 'chain', 'ten', 'million', 'pounds', 'campaign', 'What', 'lucky', 'break', 'Eight', 'weeks', 'later', 'won', 'election', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'win', 'seat', 'Parliament', 'newly', 'established', 'Purple', 'Party', 'won', 'majority', 'nationwide', 'Prime', 'Minister.The', 'men', 'Amazing', 'Mrs.', 'Pritchard', 'are', 'spineless', 'bunch', 'husband', 'drop', 'election', 'too', 'late', 'other', 'candidates', 'resort', 'feeble', 'fist', 'fights', 'even', 'policeman', 'who', 'tower', 'save', 'Ros', 'suicidal', 'male', 'employee', 'up', 'having', 'heart', 'attack', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'men', 'do', 'anything', 'Ros', 'was', 'point', 'nearly', 'gave', 'up', 'series', 'then', 'action', 'Downing', 'Street', 'more', 'political', 'Ros', 'new', 'cabinet', 'women', 'have', 'deal', 'crises', 'start', 'Ros', 'panics', 'self-doubts', 'deals', 'one', 'emergency', 'conversation', 'U.S.', 'president', 'where', 'get', 'stuffed', 'requirement', 'British', 'filmmakers', 'now', 'hate', 'George', 'Bush', 'as', 'much', 'next', 'person', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'scene', 'enough', 'movies', 'now', 'bit', 'too', 'calculated', 'Now', 'series', 'really', 'going', 'Ros', 'learn', 'politics', 'in-fighting', 'power', 'plays', 'dealing', 'one', 'disaster', 'Meanwhile', 'family', 'having', 'own', 'assortment', 'catastrophes', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'even', 'somewhat', 'unlikely', 'beginning', 'was', 'completely', 'hooked', 'ended', 'up', 'watching', 'entire', 'series', 'two', 'nights', 'Maybe', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Jane', 'Horrocks', 'Ros', 'Pritchard', 'too', 'many', 'ridiculous', 'outfits', 'Absolutely', 'Fabulous', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'entirely', 'convincing', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'rest', 'cast', 'was', 'just', 'perfect', 'though', 'Janet', 'McTeer', 'Jodhi', 'May', 'were', 'standouts', 'rest', 'cast', 'was', 'great', 'too.The', 'ending', 'seemed', 'bit', 'pasted', 'later', 'read', 'when', 'series', 'was', 'broadcast', 'England', 'was', 'explanatory', 'titles', 'end', 'way', 'will', 'have', 'thinking', 'talking', 'Ros', 'decision', 'consequences.So', 'recommendation', 'Yes', 'Even', 'have', 'few', 'problems', 'did', 'will', 'keep', 'glued', 'set', 'very', 'end']",The Amazing Mrs Pritchard
1051342,A19DW3VKM5KKYB,B000MV8Z9K,TheBandit,"[31, 33]","Viewing this six-hour UK miniseries was an unusual experience.  I expected the show to be a comedy - after all, it's premise of an ordinary middle-class woman becoming Prime Minister easily lends itself to lighthearted laughs.  This isn't the case.  While humor is definitely a strong element throughout, the show is very much a serious drama.  The six episodes are very good - densely packed with multiple interlocking storylines, each episode moving along at a brisk pace.  The acting is uniformly excellent as well.  Based on those strengths, I'm tempted to rate the show higher - but there is a problem:  it ends with a never-to-be-resolved cliffhanger.Apparently the show did not perform well in the ratings when it aired last year in the UK.  As a result, it seems the show is not returning for a second season.  There are a couple of screens containing brief text in an attempt to tie up the most important aspects of the story.  These, of course, can't be discussed without revealing too much of the story.  But suffice it to say, this is a highly unsatisfactory ending to an otherwise involving TV show.  Too many questions are left unanswered - it's literally only half the story.The main storyline concerns the title character and her unlikely career change from grocery store manager to Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.  Her decision to run for such an esteemed position stemmed from her frustration with the available candidates, as well as her friends and family assuring her that she could do a better job than any of them.  Surrounded by a skilled staff - all of whom she relies heavily upon - Ros Pritchard finds herself completely ovewhelmed with her immense responsibilities.  Throughout the six episodes, we see her trying to adapt and adjust without compromising her most important principle:  direct honesty to the people of the UK.  She strives to be the people's PM to an unprecedented degree.In addition to being politically out of her league, the show details the (mostly) negative effects her career move has on her family life.  As a mother of two, Ros finds herself unable to devote nearly the same amount of time she once did to her two girls.  Her marriage becomes strained as her husband finds himself more and more a bystander rather than participant in his own family life.  And in a key plot development, some potentially damaging family secrets are uncovered and attempted to be dealt with.I found all the character-based elements to be very compelling.  The excellent acting by a mostly-female ensemble, achored by Jane Horrocks's Mrs. Pritchard, deserves special note.  Horrocks does a good job of conveying Ros Pritchard's hesitancy at making decisions of such great importance.  Jodhi May is superb as Pritchard's 'right hand woman' Miranda Lennox.  Also particularly noteworthy is Carey Mulligan as Ros's college-age daughter.  It's really a shame we won't be able to see any more of these characters.As for the show's political content, I had a more mixed reaction.  For one, not knowing much about the British political system I was often a little confused about who everyone was and what their function is.  But the political issues that are dealt with, for the most part, are the same issues we face in the U.S.  However, there is a somewhat haphazard approach to this throughout the show.  Initially there is a focus on terrorist threats, which doesn't really go anywhere before switching gears to environmental issues.  I'm guessing that the goal was to provide an overview of the many challenges Ros was facing, but it seemed a little less focused than it could have been.All things considered, this was an intriguing and well-made miniseries that I would recommend cautiously recommend.  The DVD offers nothing that wasn't shown on TV originally, with the exception of aforementioned brief text notes at the conclusion of episode six.  It's unfortunate that the show's creative team wasn't able to discuss (via commentaries or interviews) their intent for the show beyond the initial six episodes.  Perhaps they could have offered a clearer idea of the plan than the few lines that pop up on screen before the final credits roll.  I couldn't help but feel cheated, even though that wasn't the intent.",3,"An Entertaining, Though Incomplete, Story",1191801600,"10 8, 2007",2007,4254,"['Viewing', 'six-hour', 'UK', 'miniseries', 'was', 'unusual', 'experience', 'expected', 'show', 'be', 'comedy', 'premise', 'ordinary', 'middle-class', 'woman', 'becoming', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'easily', 'lighthearted', 'laughs', ""n't"", 'case', 'humor', 'definitely', 'strong', 'element', 'show', 'very', 'much', 'serious', 'drama', 'six', 'episodes', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'densely', 'packed', 'multiple', 'interlocking', 'storylines', 'episode', 'moving', 'along', 'brisk', 'pace', 'acting', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'as', 'well', 'Based', 'strengths', ""'m"", 'tempted', 'rate', 'show', 'higher', 'problem', 'never-to-be-resolved', 'cliffhanger.Apparently', 'show', 'did', 'not', 'perform', 'well', 'ratings', 'when', 'aired', 'last', 'year', 'UK', 'result', 'show', 'not', 'returning', 'second', 'season', 'are', 'couple', 'screens', 'containing', 'brief', 'text', 'attempt', 'tie', 'up', 'most', 'important', 'aspects', 'story', 'course', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'discussed', 'revealing', 'too', 'much', 'story', 'say', 'highly', 'unsatisfactory', 'ending', 'otherwise', 'involving', 'TV', 'show', 'Too', 'many', 'questions', 'are', 'left', 'unanswered', 'literally', 'only', 'story.The', 'main', 'storyline', 'title', 'character', 'unlikely', 'career', 'change', 'grocery', 'store', 'manager', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'United', 'Kingdom', 'decision', 'run', 'such', 'esteemed', 'position', 'stemmed', 'frustration', 'available', 'candidates', 'as', 'well', 'friends', 'family', 'assuring', 'could', 'do', 'better', 'job', 'Surrounded', 'skilled', 'staff', 'whom', 'heavily', 'Ros', 'Pritchard', 'completely', 'ovewhelmed', 'immense', 'responsibilities', 'six', 'episodes', 'see', 'trying', 'adapt', 'adjust', 'compromising', 'most', 'important', 'principle', 'direct', 'honesty', 'people', 'UK', 'be', 'people', 'PM', 'unprecedented', 'degree.In', 'addition', 'being', 'politically', 'league', 'show', 'details', 'mostly', 'negative', 'effects', 'career', 'move', 'family', 'life', 'mother', 'two', 'Ros', 'unable', 'devote', 'nearly', 'same', 'amount', 'time', 'once', 'did', 'her', 'two', 'girls', 'marriage', 'becomes', 'strained', 'husband', 'more', 'more', 'bystander', 'rather', 'participant', 'own', 'family', 'life', 'key', 'plot', 'development', 'potentially', 'damaging', 'family', 'secrets', 'are', 'uncovered', 'attempted', 'be', 'dealt', 'with.I', 'found', 'character-based', 'elements', 'be', 'very', 'compelling', 'excellent', 'acting', 'mostly-female', 'ensemble', 'achored', 'Jane', 'Horrocks', 'Mrs.', 'Pritchard', 'special', 'note', 'Horrocks', 'good', 'job', 'conveying', 'Ros', 'Pritchard', 'hesitancy', 'making', 'decisions', 'such', 'great', 'importance', 'Jodhi', 'May', 'superb', 'Pritchard', ""'right"", 'hand', 'woman', 'Miranda', 'Lennox', 'Also', 'particularly', 'noteworthy', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'Ros', 'college-age', 'daughter', 'really', 'shame', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'see', 'more', 'characters.As', 'show', 'political', 'content', 'had', 'more', 'mixed', 'reaction', 'one', 'not', 'knowing', 'much', 'British', 'political', 'system', 'was', 'often', 'little', 'confused', 'who', 'everyone', 'was', 'what', 'function', 'political', 'issues', 'are', 'dealt', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'same', 'issues', 'face', 'U.S', 'However', 'somewhat', 'haphazard', 'approach', 'show', 'Initially', 'focus', 'terrorist', 'threats', ""n't"", 'really', 'go', 'anywhere', 'before', 'switching', 'gears', 'environmental', 'issues', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'goal', 'was', 'provide', 'overview', 'many', 'challenges', 'Ros', 'was', 'facing', 'seemed', 'little', 'less', 'focused', 'could', 'have', 'been.All', 'things', 'considered', 'was', 'intriguing', 'well-made', 'miniseries', 'would', 'recommend', 'cautiously', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'nothing', 'was', ""n't"", 'shown', 'TV', 'originally', 'exception', 'aforementioned', 'brief', 'text', 'notes', 'conclusion', 'episode', 'six', 'unfortunate', 'show', 'creative', 'team', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'discuss', 'commentaries', 'interviews', 'intent', 'show', 'initial', 'six', 'episodes', 'Perhaps', 'could', 'have', 'offered', 'clearer', 'idea', 'plan', 'few', 'lines', 'pop', 'up', 'screen', 'final', 'credits', 'roll', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'cheated', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'intent']",The Amazing Mrs Pritchard

That being said, I am a fan of many programs, and when The Amazing Mrs Prichard popped up on my radar, I was happy to watch the six episode BBC mini series.I would be lying if I said I knew any of the actors in this series. The star here is Jane Horrocks, who reminds me of Princess Diana.You can read what this series is about from the description above. A working mom becomes Prime Minister after starting her own political party (The Purple Party. The artist formally known as Prince is said to have donated millions to them.) It seems that the entire Purple Party is made up almost exclusively by women. There is never any real mention why this is, or if it is a party of/by women only. But this series sees almost every cabinet member is a woman, again for no reason given.The entire series was somewhat farfetched. Being honest seems to be the only qualification needed for Pritchard to become both the head of the Purple Party, as well as Prime Minister. It plays out like a weak The West Wing-lite. No one political subject is given much room to breath, save for the mandate to not drive once a week. (That would never work in the U.S.)The husband and two children of the Prime Minister is given ample time to develop as characters, as is a few other key cabinet members. Beyond that, most are simply paper cutouts, not given enough time or script to tell their story.And it is the story here that is the draw, at least right up to the end. And as much as I enjoyed the six hours spent watching this mini-series, I did feel somewhat cheated at the very end. Rather than showing what happened after all was said and done, the viewer was simply given two paragraphs of text to close our the show. It's almost as if the writers or producers either ran out of time, or energy to properly close out the series. It really, really needed at least one more episode to wrap it all up, and give the viewers a sense of closure.Jane Horrocks is great in this roll. I would enjoy seeing her in another series. She does a great job of showing the changes a year of being Prime Minister has on both her physical and physiological self. Very convincing.I enjoyed this, even with the left wanting more ending.",4,"Ending not up to par, but good show",1191369600,"10 3, 2007",2007,2294,"['Being', 'American', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'watch', 'much', 'BBC', 'programing', 'Which', 'course', 'sad', 'being', 'said', 'am', 'fan', 'many', 'programs', 'when', 'Amazing', 'Mrs', 'Prichard', 'popped', 'up', 'radar', 'was', 'happy', 'watch', 'six', 'episode', 'BBC', 'mini', 'series.I', 'would', 'be', 'lying', 'said', 'knew', 'actors', 'series', 'star', 'here', 'Jane', 'Horrocks', 'who', 'Princess', 'Diana.You', 'can', 'read', 'what', 'series', 'description', 'working', 'mom', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'starting', 'own', 'political', 'party', 'Purple', 'Party', 'artist', 'formally', 'known', 'Prince', 'said', 'have', 'donated', 'millions', 'entire', 'Purple', 'Party', 'made', 'up', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'women', 'never', 'real', 'mention', 'why', 'party', 'of/by', 'women', 'only', 'series', 'almost', 'cabinet', 'member', 'woman', 'again', 'reason', 'given.The', 'entire', 'series', 'was', 'somewhat', 'farfetched', 'Being', 'honest', 'be', 'only', 'qualification', 'needed', 'Pritchard', 'become', 'head', 'Purple', 'Party', 'as', 'well', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'out', 'weak', 'West', 'Wing-lite', 'one', 'political', 'subject', 'given', 'much', 'room', 'breath', 'save', 'mandate', 'not', 'drive', 'once', 'week', 'would', 'never', 'work', 'U.S.', 'husband', 'two', 'children', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'given', 'ample', 'time', 'develop', 'characters', 'few', 'other', 'key', 'cabinet', 'members', 'Beyond', 'most', 'are', 'simply', 'paper', 'cutouts', 'not', 'given', 'enough', 'time', 'script', 'tell', 'story.And', 'story', 'here', 'draw', 'least', 'right', 'up', 'end', 'as', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'six', 'hours', 'spent', 'watching', 'mini-series', 'did', 'feel', 'somewhat', 'cheated', 'very', 'end', 'Rather', 'showing', 'what', 'happened', 'was', 'said', 'done', 'viewer', 'was', 'simply', 'given', 'two', 'paragraphs', 'text', 'close', 'show', 'almost', 'writers', 'producers', 'ran', 'time', 'energy', 'properly', 'close', 'out', 'series', 'really', 'really', 'needed', 'least', 'one', 'more', 'episode', 'wrap', 'up', 'give', 'viewers', 'sense', 'closure.Jane', 'Horrocks', 'great', 'roll', 'would', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'series', 'great', 'job', 'showing', 'changes', 'year', 'being', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'physical', 'physiological', 'self', 'Very', 'convincing.I', 'enjoyed', 'even', 'left', 'wanting', 'more', 'ending']",The Amazing Mrs Pritchard

How could you not love the woman who brought ""Bubbles"" to life on Ab Fab? She was great in ""Life is Sweet"" and dead amazing in ""Little voice"" (a role written for her and her amazing voice). ""Chicken Run"" ""Cabaret"" ""Wyrd Sisters"" She's just great. So that we loved this series is not a huge surprise. We, however, were surprised at how much we liked it.The story of the series goes, Mrs. Pritchard is a grocery store manager. During elections, two candidates running for MP mix it up outside her store. She tells them, running government ""is not rocket science."" And decides to run. MPs from all sides join her ""Purple Party,"" and she ends up the Prime Minister...We get to see her form her government and deal with world problems (the assassination of an African leader's family) and problems in her government (bribes & MPs on boozers) and within her own family (wild teenage daughter, skeletons in her husband's closet). All tightly woven into six (mostly) believable scripts.It really leavse you wanting more due in a good part to the wonderful cast. Jane's Mrs. Pritchard is idealistic and naive, but she's determined to be an honest politician and not take crap from members of the opposition. Janet McTeer gives a jaw-dropingly realistic performance as the Chsncellor of the Exchequer. She's a 45 year old career politician who's lonely...and falls for a 25 year old staff member--but what you think will happen doesn't. Honestly, I can't think of an actor who didn't give their role their all. really good performances all around.The British audience might find this partisan...and they might not believe it to the extent that WE did (being nearly clueless as to the inner workings of British politics)...but we loved every minute of it. If only ABC had done as good a job as this with ""Commander in Chief"" it might have lasted more than four episodes.This is 354 minutes of excellent television. It's funny...and both of us teared up several times...and pulse-pounding. So we WOULD have liked a few extras on the DVD (interviews at least) and there were a few (FEW) weak moments in the script--we did say ""Oh, she wouldn't have done that"" or ""Wasn't that a little too convienent?"" but it's TV, and as I said excellent TV.If you missed it on Masterpiece Theater on PBS, this DVD collection is well worth your entertainment dollar.",4,IS American TV ever this good?,1192320000,"10 14, 2007",2007,2440,"['First', 'let', 'say', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'most', 'objective', 'reviewer', 'series', 'am', 'Jane', 'Horrocks', 'fan', 'How', 'could', 'not', 'love', 'woman', 'who', 'brought', 'Bubbles', 'life', 'Ab', 'Fab', 'was', 'great', 'Life', 'Sweet', 'dead', 'amazing', 'Little', 'voice', 'role', 'written', 'amazing', 'voice', 'Chicken', 'Run', 'Cabaret', 'Wyrd', 'Sisters', 'just', 'great', 'loved', 'series', 'not', 'huge', 'surprise', 'however', 'were', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'liked', 'it.The', 'story', 'series', 'Mrs.', 'Pritchard', 'grocery', 'store', 'manager', 'elections', 'two', 'candidates', 'running', 'MP', 'mix', 'up', 'store', 'running', 'government', 'not', 'rocket', 'science', 'run', 'MPs', 'sides', 'join', 'Purple', 'Party', 'up', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'get', 'see', 'form', 'government', 'deal', 'world', 'problems', 'assassination', 'African', 'leader', 'family', 'problems', 'government', 'MPs', 'boozers', 'own', 'family', 'wild', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'skeletons', 'husband', 'closet', 'tightly', 'woven', 'six', 'mostly', 'believable', 'scripts.It', 'really', 'wanting', 'more', 'due', 'good', 'part', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'Jane', 'Mrs.', 'Pritchard', 'idealistic', 'naive', 'determined', 'be', 'honest', 'politician', 'not', 'take', 'crap', 'members', 'opposition', 'Janet', 'McTeer', 'jaw-dropingly', 'realistic', 'performance', 'Chsncellor', 'Exchequer', '45', 'year', 'old', 'career', 'politician', 'who', 'lonely', '25', 'year', 'old', 'staff', 'member', 'what', 'think', 'will', 'happen', ""n't"", 'Honestly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'actor', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'role', 'really', 'good', 'performances', 'around.The', 'British', 'audience', 'might', 'find', 'partisan', 'might', 'not', 'believe', 'extent', 'WE', 'did', 'being', 'nearly', 'clueless', 'inner', 'workings', 'British', 'politics', 'loved', 'minute', 'only', 'ABC', 'had', 'done', 'as', 'good', 'job', 'Commander', 'Chief', 'might', 'have', 'lasted', 'more', 'four', 'episodes.This', '354', 'minutes', 'excellent', 'television', 'funny', 'teared', 'up', 'several', 'times', 'pulse-pounding', 'WOULD', 'have', 'liked', 'few', 'extras', 'DVD', 'interviews', 'least', 'were', 'few', 'FEW', 'weak', 'moments', 'script', 'did', 'say', 'Oh', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'done', 'Was', ""n't"", 'little', 'too', 'convienent', 'TV', 'said', 'excellent', 'TV.If', 'missed', 'Masterpiece', 'Theater', 'PBS', 'DVD', 'collection', 'well', 'worth', 'entertainment', 'dollar']",The Amazing Mrs Pritchard

The first episode's light comedic tone rapidly gives way to a much harder-edged dramatic feeling as the stakes are raised from dark-horse candidate to overwhelmed Prime Minister with family problems -- it's not terribly realistic, but plenty of fun to watch.  At six episodes, however, it feels somewhat incomplete.
