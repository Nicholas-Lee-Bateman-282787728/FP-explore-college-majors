So quiet at times, that you may find yourself turning up the volume. The story line is set mainly as a romance.The Story of Grey Owl is quite good. I wish not to give away any details, but I found the movie much better the second time I watched - when I knew Grey Owl's secret. I gave the movie 3 or 4 stars the first time I viewed it, and 4 to 5 stars the second time and after.Grey Owl was a man who lived out his dream no matter how odd others would have found it(though few knew the real Grey Owl). The movie seems to encourage others to live their dreams.The acting is great (again don't expect high action and suspense), and the scenery is grand.If you like movies about the wilderness or Native Peoples and were not really impressed by this movie the first time you watched, try a second viewing.

545007,A162BNPOODLKC7,B00003GPEZ,D. Johnson,"[0, 1]",The Movie Grey Owl is easily one of my favorite movies. I have worked as a conservationist all of my life so I was already familiar with the actual story. As a Mohawk Native American myself I thought Annie Galipeau was excellent as a Native American woman and did justice to the real life wife of Grey Owl. I thought Pierce Brosnan was really excellent in this role. Very few negative reviewers seemed to understand the actual impact of the real Grey Owl story or of the difficulty of making documentary movies. I have been both a scientist and had a role in documentary movies and it is a lot more difficult than most imagine. I know almost every woman I have ever known has loved this movie. Comments have been made about it not being filled with action and danger. Having been in these settings and a combat veteran I am somewhat puzzled and disappointed in such reactions. There is lots of action from the far north and the real story and old film clips are beautifully woven in. The scenery is lovely. I highly recommend this movie.,5,One of my single favorite movies and very romantic,1365120000,"04 5, 2013",2013,1037,"['Movie', 'Grey', 'Owl', 'easily', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'have', 'worked', 'conservationist', 'life', 'so', 'was', 'already', 'familiar', 'actual', 'story', 'Mohawk', 'Native', 'American', 'thought', 'Annie', 'Galipeau', 'was', 'excellent', 'Native', 'American', 'woman', 'did', 'justice', 'real', 'life', 'wife', 'Grey', 'Owl', 'thought', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'was', 'really', 'excellent', 'role', 'Very', 'few', 'negative', 'reviewers', 'seemed', 'understand', 'actual', 'impact', 'real', 'Grey', 'Owl', 'story', 'difficulty', 'making', 'documentary', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'scientist', 'had', 'role', 'documentary', 'movies', 'lot', 'more', 'difficult', 'most', 'imagine', 'know', 'almost', 'woman', 'have', 'ever', 'known', 'loved', 'movie', 'Comments', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'not', 'being', 'filled', 'action', 'danger', 'Having', 'been', 'settings', 'combat', 'veteran', 'am', 'somewhat', 'puzzled', 'disappointed', 'such', 'reactions', 'lots', 'action', 'far', 'north', 'real', 'story', 'old', 'film', 'clips', 'are', 'beautifully', 'woven', 'scenery', 'lovely', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie']",Grey Owl VHS

I just bought it since I'm so much into indiginous people's history and stories and this didn't disappoint in the least!The story is a true one of an Englishman that moved to Canada at an early age and took on the role of a people he was fascinated with and becomes a trapper. He later grudgingly finds a special person who helps him strive to be more and he becomes one of our first environmentalists. I normally don't like to tell the story or give much away but I feel this is essential so you know what you are getting. In addition, many may wonder why in the heck Pierce Brosnan is playing the role of a Native American like I did!The message is a great one and despite the deception, Grey Owl's story is an extraordinary one. The DVD is excellent as it has some historical film you can view of the real Grey Owl in the earlier part of the last century. That alone makes this DVD an exception purchase.I wholeheartedly recommend it but cannot give 5 stars as I don't see it best in class for it's genre.

Grey Owl aka Archie is different from his fellow  Indians - he is well versed, educated, and a brillant writer. Grey Owl  eventually becomes a voice for the mindless exploitation of wild places and  animals. Only until he goes to England does his past come back to haunt  him.I agree with the other reviewer that Richard Attenborough decided  too &quot;clean up&quot; Grey Owl's image.

Sad, because though it might not have been noticed in cinemas, Grey Owl is a well-made, well-told interesting story that is acted to perfection by Pierce Brosnan. This is one of those smaller films that really stays with you.Grey Owl is based on an real-life story of a native guide in the Canadian wilderness. An early conservationist, he struggled to get the public's attention to the loss of many of Canada's wild animals such as the beaver. But Grey Owl had a secret that, when discovered, threatens to derail his crusade to save the native Canadians and the wilderness.This movie is about all that and much more.

Last night I was just about to go to bed and this movie came on.  I said to myself, I've got to see this.  As I watched I became intrigued by the subtle hint that something was amiss about the Grey Owl character.  It was very late at night, but I was not sleepy because this movie is incredible.This is a moving story based on the actual life of Archibald Stansfeld Belaney.  It is very well acted, written and directed.  If you know nothing about the life of Archie Grey Owl, you will be amazed.  There are some scenes in this movie that are very touching and powerful.  For example, when Pony falls through the ice and Grey Owl rescues her.  Also, when Grey Owl tells Pony his secret, her reaction is heart warming and powerful.  To reveal too much about the story line is to spoil the film for someone unfamiliar with the life of a very interesting man.I watch a lot of movies and this one is really very good; and certainly worth the $8.99 asking price, in my opinion.

It didn't seem to fit. Of course, I grew up watching Brosnan as Remmington Steele so him in any role other than one of class seems out of place. However, as I was swept into the world of the movie, I actually began to believe that Brosnan was Grey Owl, aka Archie. He seemed a little different than other Native-Americans, but not so different that he seemed totally out of place.  By the time the movie ended and after I had done a little research about Grey Owl, I felt Brosnan had done a wonderful job and had been perfectly cast.GREY OWL is a film directed by Sir Richard Attenborough and tells part of the story of Grey Owl, aka Archie, a Canadian Indian who began a conservation crusade to protect the native wildlife of Canada in the early twentieth century. However, Grey Owl has a secret that once revealed threatens everything he has fought to perserve.The movie itself is engaging and has a great story to tell. It's filled with beautiful images of nature and has a strong message.
