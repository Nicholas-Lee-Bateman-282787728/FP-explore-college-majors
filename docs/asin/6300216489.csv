Finally Guinness delivers an accurate, temperate and sensible performance, giving viewers a glimpse of how Hitler really was. Guinness resembles Hitler to a reasonable degree and the script quotes from the Fuehrer's own table talk, so there is a degree of authenticity in the dialogue. The actress who portrays Eva Braun also comes up with a sober and fairly accurate portrayal of Hitler's mistress.The plot is a bit plodding and the movie would be quite boring to anyone without a strong interest in WWII or the Third Reich. In addition, the ending of the movie is historically inaccurate and a trifle campy: Hitler and Eva never had an argument prior to their duel suicides.Still, the reason for watching this movie is Alec Guinness' interesting performance as Hitler. Contrast his intelligent interpretation to the dozens of other inferior film Hitlers.",4,Guinness is the best-ever Hitler,1056758400,"06 28, 2003",2003,1024,"['So', 'often', 'Adolf', 'Hitler', 'been', 'portrayed', 'films', 'raving', 'psychotic', 'usually', 'actors', 'physically', 'unsuited', 'part', 'insultingly', 'cheap', 'stick-on', 'mustaches', 'Finally', 'Guinness', 'delivers', 'accurate', 'temperate', 'sensible', 'performance', 'giving', 'viewers', 'glimpse', 'how', 'Hitler', 'really', 'was', 'Guinness', 'Hitler', 'reasonable', 'degree', 'script', 'Fuehrer', 'own', 'table', 'talk', 'so', 'degree', 'authenticity', 'dialogue', 'actress', 'who', 'Eva', 'Braun', 'also', 'up', 'sober', 'fairly', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'Hitler', 'mistress.The', 'plot', 'bit', 'plodding', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'quite', 'boring', 'anyone', 'strong', 'interest', 'WWII', 'Third', 'Reich', 'addition', 'ending', 'movie', 'historically', 'inaccurate', 'trifle', 'campy', 'Hitler', 'Eva', 'never', 'had', 'argument', 'prior', 'duel', 'suicides.Still', 'reason', 'watching', 'movie', 'Alec', 'Guinness', 'interesting', 'performance', 'Hitler', 'Contrast', 'intelligent', 'interpretation', 'dozens', 'other', 'inferior', 'film', 'Hitlers']",Hitler: The Last Ten Days 1973  VHS

The film depicts the last few weeks of Hitler's life, how the Russians were advancing on Hitler's bunker and how the high-ranking officials of the Nazi Party and the large number of military officers that were down there planned their escape from Berlin.  The film was suspenseful and exciting.  It kept me entertained.  It wasn't depressing at all.  The cast in this film gave great performances especially the portrayal of Hitler.

221500,A26HFSVLAGULIM,6300216489,"Heather L. Parisi ""Robert and Heather Parisi""","[3, 4]","IN A NUTSHELL: THE STORY OF THE FINAL DEMISE OF HITLER & HIS EMPIRE""Hitler: Last 10 Days"", featuring Alec Guinness in the lead as Adolf Hitler, is an historicially-significant although flawed attempt to recapture the essence of the final disposition of Hilter and his Third Reich.Alec Guinness plays Adolf Hitler as a suffering introvert motivated by a combination of maniac antagonistic intensity and withdrawn somber resignation. Guinness portrays Hitler with strongly-emotional, often-histrionic displays of both sorrow and contempt toward the German people, almost simultaneously. This is very well done in that Guinness does reveal the broken and tortured mind of the former proud leader of the great German Reich. In essence, Germany's external destruction seems to be going on internally with what is left of Hitler's presence of mind.WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT: WORST TRAVEL DESTINATION OF APRIL 1945 - CENTRAL BERLINFrom its set, which was almost entirely inside Hitler's Berlin bunker, 'Hitler: Last 10 Days' attempts to narrate a kind of historic journal for posterity to depict the dying days of Hitler and his Third Reich as the Russian army comes ever closer to his underground lair in central Berlin.In this dark underground setting, Hitler is portrayed as a broken leader attached to a sorrowful band of followers whose former imperial swagger has literally turned into a sort of collective drunken stagger. Hitler, it seems, is the only sober one in the bunker, but he has obviously found his escape within his collapsing sanity. The film utilizes a series of vignettes that are strung together to make this immense subject with dozens of players fit into a feature-length film, in English, for a general, moviegoing audience. Obviously this limits the scope of the project. Here are some examples of the scenes:Hitler summons the new head of the defunct Luftwaffe [Eric Porter as Gen. Von Greim] to Berlin to be promoted to Field Marshall, only to have what was left of the Luftwaffe destroyed trying to escort the new Field Marshall to Berlin for the meeting and tea. Of course, Hitler's tailor made Von Greim a Field Marshall's uniform with which for him to return to his empty post. Of course, this tale is essentially true and is included in other books and films about this epic historic moment. The sense of proportion is the only thing I would question here as other chronicles of this event seem to give the 'Luftwaffe Debacle' relatively little importance in the grand scheme of the last days. It does, however, demonstrate that the once-sharp mind of the leader of the Third Reich was not functioning rationally.Another scene, which also shows up in other films and literature, is what happens when Hitler finds out that there was NO COUNTER-OFFENSIVE, which was to have been led by Steiner, against the Soviet forces. In this scene, we can see most clearly the flaws in the film, whereby certain literary licenses are taken for the sake of dramatization during Hitler's 'public/private' reaction to this ""betrayal"" by the General Staff. It is very well done by Guinness as Hitler, but it is a bit theatrical, even for Adolf Hitler. The film 'Downfall' depicts the scene rather poignantly and probably closer to what really happened. To be specific, in the film, Hitler portrayed by Guinness promised to have the chiefs of the German General staff 'Drawn and Quartered' and to have them 'Drowned in their own blood', and much more, while in a closed-door session that everyone could hear despite the cataclysmic cacophony that was always in the bunker's background.Lastly, the scene depicting Hitler having an argument that compelled Eva Braun to take poison during Hitler's final madman-monologue while he was cursing at her is a bit too much. The coup de grace shortly followed as Hitler, staring at Eva's suddenly lifeless body shouts, ""YOU HAVE BETRAYED ME"" before shooting himself.BOTTOM LINE: NOT A PERFECT FILM BUT WHAT ELSE WAS THERE IN 1973 ON THE SUBJECTThough this was made to be as accurate as possible, time and careful analysis has shown that some of what we see in this film is somewhat fictionalized, but the bulk of what is depicted is shown rather well. One must bear in mind that this film was released in 1973 when accurate depictions of the end of Hitler and the Third Reich were only known to scholars and prosecutors. The rest of us were given ""The 3 Stooges,"" ""Charlie Chaplin,"" and ""The Marx Brothers"" to come to terms with Hitler and his cartoonish cronies which served to further deepen the myth of Hitler the Caricature. Only with the more recent releases of groundbreaking films such as ""Downfall"" and ""Inside the Third Reich"" do we clearly see this film's shortcomings. In other words, ""Hitler: Last 10 Days"" was, at the time of its release, a rather revolutionary film and was the first of several better films and books that followed. For all the aforementioned reasons this is a film worth watching, but it is best to be somewhat familiar with the subject before viewing.",4,NOT UP TO THE STANDARD OF DOWNFALL BUT PRODUCED 30 YEARS

His Hitler seemed strangely amused, more than anything else, as his entire world crumbled around him. (I guess he was just keeping a stiff British upper lip.) Like with the other pre-Untergang movies, you have the impression that the writers had a checklist of Bunker events they needed to provide dialogue for, and the director threw these scenes together with no regard for cohesion, tension or drama. The supporting cast was better than ""The Bunker"", but the movie was interrupted several times by Holocaust indoctrination segments, and the writers made this movie ridiculous by inserting a pre-suicide quarrel between Adolf and Eva.

This movie combines drama with documentry.  Actually footage is cleverly interspaced during the movie to provide shocking reality checks to the bizarre events occuring in the bunker.  In this movie we can see how Hitler became the victim of his own doomsday prophetcies.  His cruelty remained with him to the last, and Guiness provides a emotional look at the last few days of his life.  There will certainly be a debate over this movie and ""The Bunker"" with Anthony Hopkins.  For me this was always the better film in terms of its intensity.  The movie almost seems like a play and it moves along rapidly to its bitter finish.  Some may think Guinness is too high strung in his Hitler, but his acting is nonetheless superb.

221505,AUPE71CN3LIF4,6300216489,tgfabthunderbird,"[1, 5]","Sir Alec Guinness' portrayal of the Nazi leader in the final days of the Third Reich was to say the least, chilling.  He had the madman down, though questions of accuracy regarding Hitler's state of being at that time did not get the full treatment.The possibility that Hitler was suffering from Parkinson's Disease (i.e., the confirmed trembling) and the wracked state of his body and mind thanks to Dr. Morrell's drugs was not really dealt with here.The part of Hitler's musings, going on about the good old days and what he planned to do after the war was over, this was true.  How Hitler could detach himself from the reality that was the bunker and the destruction of the world around him and talk about buildings, monuments and the like...this was confirmed, that he spent a great deal of time babbling about these things.Also, some of the events do not appear to have been accurate -- a girl showing up to get Iron Crosses and witnessing the execution of Hermann Fegelein has not been confirmed.  Fegelein, the SS liasion to Hitler and who married Gretl Braun, Eva's sister was hauled back to the bunker and executed, that is true, but Eva's upset reaction to this does not appear to have been the case.  Apparently, she did nothing to stop Fegelein's shooting, even though she knew about it.In addition, Hitler's ranting at Eva right before their suicides does not appear to have occurred.  There were people, including Martin Bormann and Heinz Linge (Hitler's valet) right outside the door to the room where it happened.  They didn't hear that, though they did hear the shot that killed Hitler.The movie suffers from a real feeling of short funds, though it may have been made this way to look bleak.I have noticed many comparisons of Guinness' performance to that of Sir Anthony Hopkins in ""The Bunker.""
