684506,A1LAAZUR8YFRW8,B00005UM3C,"Barbara ""barbara11td""","[2, 2]","An excellent movie illustrating how a picture is NOT always worth a thousand words and you can't always believe what you see.  An innocent photograph of a mother's child is minsinterpreted by a clerk at a film store which causes harm, and a struggle to regain her family as it once had been.  Frustration at the technician who was so out of bounds, but then a reality check creeps in as in the world today, we can't become too careful or diligent. Thankfully, the truth comes to light, but it leaves one with the sad feeling on the state of the world as it is today.",4,Great Movie about Rush to Judgment!,1375056000,"07 29, 2013",2013,566,"['excellent', 'movie', 'illustrating', 'how', 'picture', 'NOT', 'always', 'thousand', 'words', 'ca', ""n't"", 'always', 'believe', 'what', 'see', 'innocent', 'photograph', 'mother', 'child', 'minsinterpreted', 'clerk', 'film', 'store', 'harm', 'struggle', 'regain', 'family', 'once', 'had', 'been', 'Frustration', 'technician', 'who', 'was', 'so', 'bounds', 'then', 'reality', 'check', 'creeps', 'world', 'today', 'ca', ""n't"", 'become', 'too', 'careful', 'diligent', 'Thankfully', 'truth', 'light', 'one', 'sad', 'feeling', 'state', 'world', 'today']",N/A

The mom then faces some unfair accusations regarding the treatment of her daughters.Good movie to reflect on the current state of this world.

684510,A1O3B5X4RZDKSF,B00005UM3C,Lesa Rasure,"[2, 2]","This is a very powerful film. It deals with a very upsetting subject, child pornography. But the problem is, there was not anything there to start with. A mom and her kids playing around with friends, nothing more. It just goes to show you anyone can pervert a situation if they want. An opinion does not make it fact. Too often we see a negative spin on perfectly innocent situations. This is a very powerful example of just how far accusations can go with the right people involved.Add the legal system, and you have an innocent person on trial. I thought the acting was very good, and I really enjoyed the fact that this mom refused to give up and accept anything less than an acquittal. I was very pleasantly surprised with this movie. Kudos on the script, and the handling of this sensitive topic. I am very happy to recommend this film, and very happy that I watched it.",5,Opinions are not fact.
