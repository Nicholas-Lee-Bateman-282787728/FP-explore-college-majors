I've attended his concerts in the US and own every VHS tape and DVD he's ever made for the US and around the world, but this DVD was a disappointment. The medium and close up shots were, as usual, excellent, but the wide shots look like they were shot in SD. They look horrible on a big screen. Also, NO EXTRA FEATURES. When you pay top dollar for a Andre Rieu DVD, you expect some bonus material. Not this time.The editing was second rate. Many times, the cutaway shots didn't match the action on the stage.The DVD just looked thrown together. Not a pro job at all.I'll be very careful about buying the next DVD.",3,"Good, but imperfect camera work and editing",1345420800,"08 20, 2012",2012,637,"['am', 'huge', 'Andre', 'Rieu', ""'ve"", 'attended', 'concerts', 'US', 'own', 'VHS', 'tape', 'DVD', 'ever', 'made', 'US', 'world', 'DVD', 'was', 'disappointment', 'medium', 'close', 'up', 'shots', 'were', 'usual', 'excellent', 'wide', 'shots', 'look', 'were', 'shot', 'SD', 'look', 'horrible', 'big', 'screen', 'Also', 'NO', 'EXTRA', 'FEATURES', 'When', 'pay', 'top', 'dollar', 'Andre', 'Rieu', 'DVD', 'expect', 'bonus', 'material', 'Not', 'time.The', 'editing', 'was', 'second', 'rate', 'Many', 'times', 'cutaway', 'shots', 'did', ""n't"", 'match', 'action', 'stage.The', 'DVD', 'just', 'looked', 'thrown', 'together', 'Not', 'pro', 'job', 'all.I', ""'ll"", 'be', 'very', 'careful', 'buying', 'next', 'DVD']",N/A

ANY DVD that is done here will be the best of the best from all the concerts he has done all over the world. While Rieu and his Johann Strauss Orchestra & Choir bring their heart and soul and humor to every performance they do, everywhere in the world, it seems they are able to ratchet up the entertainment level for ANY concert done in Maastricht because people come from all over the planet to be a part of these.
