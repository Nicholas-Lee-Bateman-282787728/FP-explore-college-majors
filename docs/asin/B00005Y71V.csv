689430,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B00005Y71V,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[2, 2]","It's a documentary, it's a biography, it's an intimate glimpse into one of the most fascinating scholars of the 20th century.  I am aware of the Hero's Journey as a primary form of myth. So I wanted to see what Joseph Campbell, whose work has impressed me a great deal, had to say about it.Well, he has a lot, but the producer of the documentary also has a lot to say, effectively weaving Campbell's own biography into the mythological pattern, as if to say that Campbell is himself one such hero. And it does fit, because Campbell points out that the central point to all these stories is what comes from within the individual that is itself sacred, and not external forces or forms.Using images from a great many traditions, starting with Native Americans when he was just a boy, Campbell makes a convincing case for the commonality of basic mythical truths throughout the world, through many centuries. Yes, he includes Judeo-Christian mythology. But he tells the tale of a radio interview where the interviewer made it clear he had no idea what myth is, and probably had no definition of the term metaphor at all. When pressed to provide an example, he did what many people do, and provide an example of a simile instead. Campbell said he felt bad for having demolished this young man before his live radio audience, but still manages to get across the fact that a myth or metaphor is neither a lie nor a truth. It is something which represents a truth, but not directly.Campbell ranged far and wide in his studies, and he takes us on much the same journey in this hour-long documentary. From Native American, he moves to Arthurian legends, which were the subject of his studies abroad in the 1920s. Thence to Hindu, Buddhist, and Christian mythology, keeping always to the point that mythology is not subject to the true/false standards of historical writing, but an understanding of the metaphorical and allegorical aspects.Some of the best sequences are when Campbell is telling mythological stories to his students, including an explanation of their symbolism, their value to those who passed them down through their tribe, and so on. He's quite a teacher by anyone's standard.",4,An Interesting Guy With a Lot to Teach Us,1336953600,"05 14, 2012",2012,2185,"['documentary', 'biography', 'intimate', 'glimpse', 'one', 'most', 'fascinating', 'scholars', '20th', 'century', 'am', 'aware', 'Hero', 'Journey', 'primary', 'form', 'myth', 'wanted', 'see', 'what', 'Joseph', 'Campbell', 'work', 'impressed', 'great', 'deal', 'had', 'say', 'it.Well', 'lot', 'producer', 'documentary', 'also', 'lot', 'say', 'effectively', 'weaving', 'Campbell', 'own', 'biography', 'mythological', 'pattern', 'say', 'Campbell', 'one', 'such', 'hero', 'fit', 'Campbell', 'points', 'out', 'central', 'point', 'stories', 'what', 'individual', 'sacred', 'not', 'external', 'forces', 'forms.Using', 'images', 'great', 'many', 'traditions', 'starting', 'Native', 'Americans', 'when', 'was', 'just', 'boy', 'Campbell', 'convincing', 'case', 'commonality', 'basic', 'mythical', 'truths', 'world', 'many', 'centuries', 'Yes', 'Judeo-Christian', 'mythology', 'tale', 'radio', 'interview', 'where', 'interviewer', 'made', 'clear', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'myth', 'probably', 'had', 'definition', 'term', 'metaphor', 'When', 'pressed', 'provide', 'example', 'did', 'what', 'many', 'people', 'do', 'provide', 'example', 'simile', 'instead', 'Campbell', 'said', 'felt', 'bad', 'having', 'demolished', 'young', 'man', 'live', 'radio', 'audience', 'still', 'get', 'fact', 'myth', 'metaphor', 'lie', 'truth', 'something', 'truth', 'not', 'directly.Campbell', 'ranged', 'far', 'wide', 'studies', 'much', 'same', 'journey', 'hour-long', 'documentary', 'Native', 'American', 'Arthurian', 'legends', 'were', 'subject', 'studies', 'abroad', '1920s', 'Thence', 'Hindu', 'Buddhist', 'Christian', 'mythology', 'keeping', 'always', 'point', 'mythology', 'not', 'subject', 'true/false', 'standards', 'historical', 'writing', 'understanding', 'metaphorical', 'allegorical', 'aspects.Some', 'best', 'sequences', 'are', 'when', 'Campbell', 'telling', 'mythological', 'stories', 'students', 'including', 'explanation', 'symbolism', 'value', 'who', 'passed', 'down', 'tribe', 'so', 'quite', 'teacher', 'anyone', 'standard']",Joseph Campbell - The Hero's Journey

First, I thought it would be an in depth discussion of ""The Hero's Journey"". which is a truly important concept in my view.  When I determined that it was more biographical (I should have paid more attention to the description), I settled in for learning more about the man.  Although there were some interesting biographical scenes, the movie lacked focus as it bounced around between early years, an award ceremony, and lectures/seminars with student groups.

Morgan ""Light Coach""","[93, 97]","I am a reflective person by nature, I believe that most people are, I just think that for the most part, a lot of us have gotten sidetracked. Instead of facing our issues and our challenges we face the television and we escape our pain by watching the pains that others are going through...Anna Nicole...Brittney Spears...and I've heard a lot of people comment on these two women...they're ""nuts"", ""freaks"", they ""have everything but don't even know it..."" but I see these women as symbols for where we are as a culture; lost, sad, empty...This documentary reminds me in such a brilliant way that we really are on a journey. That each one of us has a role to play out and that is to learn how to be the ""star"" of our own production. Most of us have not learned how to do this. Most of us think that life just happens and we have to deal with what life gives us. But nothing can happen to us, until it happens ""through"" us...through our own perceptions, our own attitudes, our own beliefs about it. Most of us profess to believing in some kind of Higher Power and yet we are afraid to admit that this Higher Power is within us...that we are, in Truth, expressions of this Higher Power.Joseph Campbell would be the first to admit that for the most part, most of us are not afraid of our darkness, our shadows, our fears...what we are most afraid of is our brilliance, our light, our beauty. There is no devil outside of us waiting to ""snatch"" our souls, we steal from ourselves every time we think we are ""miserable sinners"" rather than extensions of the Divine.We are literally in the dark about who we truly are. Anna Nicole was. Brittney Spears is. Most of us are. We are not our bodies. We are not these personalities or these behaviors or any of these things that we typically identify with in the physical world. We will not change anything in our life through hate. In fact, hating certain things will only bring these things about more frequently. We must instead yield to the Light, surrender to Love, be willing to use our Lives in way that serve, bless, and heal the whole world. We must learn to trust our own heart, be guided by our own soul, be lead by our own Light. Don't let yourself become hypnotized or seduced by power ""out there""...the true power, the only power...is right where you are...you are your own savior, you are your own hero. Your human life is symbolic for something greater. The only reason why there are shadows in your life is because you are standing in your own Light.I highly recommend anything by Campbell. His wisdom and his gentle humor can cut through years of accumulated ""junk"". Campbell truly followed his own advice, he lived his ""bliss"". His passion, his dedication to Truth, his willingness to shine all shows up in this DVD.

This documentary follows JC's own life story in the context of his classic work 'The Hero with a thousand faces.'How his early interest in Indian Culture and their stories eventually crisscrossed with other cultures, his early Christian upbringing and moving away from that to discover the stories from other cultures, and spiritual systems, and get a more global perspective.In particular he references a chance meeting with Indian philosopher Krishnamurti on an Atlantic crossing, when K gave him a book about the Buddha, which illumined some commonalites with his Indian folklore studies.  Eventually he discerned the common patterns of all mythology, and the story of the hero who gets the call to adventure, refuses the call, and then is compelled to take the adventure and commit to it. He also mentions Carl Jung's influence on his work.If you are like me, you would have to watch several times to get the most out of it.Interesting to note the influence he had on George Lucas, who used HWTF as a template for Star Wars.  George Lucas pays tribute to Campbell, and there is plenty of footage from Star Wars to ilustrate the steps of the Hero's Journey.If you are interested in storytelling, mythology or writing,  I highly recommend this dvd for your consideration.
