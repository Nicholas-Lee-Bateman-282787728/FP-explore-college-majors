This is from 1986, and although Anita wasn't in her prime at age 67, she's still DAMNED good and well-worth hearing.  Her performance of ""I Can't Get Started"" is stellar, and not only rivals her mid 1950's version, it's actually much better. This concert has been previously issued on CD as ""Live at Ronnie Scotts"" and it's nice to finally have it available on DVD.",4,Interesting 1986 live concert,1189900800,"09 16, 2007",2007,434,"[""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'Gloria', 'was', 'reviewing', 'was', ""n't"", 'product', '1986', 'Anita', 'was', ""n't"", 'prime', 'age', '67', 'still', 'DAMNED', 'good', 'well-worth', 'hearing', 'performance', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Get', 'Started', 'stellar', 'not', 'only', 'mid', '1950', 'version', 'actually', 'much', 'better', 'concert', 'been', 'previously', 'issued', 'CD', 'Live', 'Ronnie', 'Scotts', 'nice', 'finally', 'have', 'available', 'DVD']",Anita O'Day - Live at Ronnie Scott's

Not outstanding.~ The program is varied, and she shows signs of the old spark on the up-tempo numbers.  However, the ballades drag a little bit (even Anita admitted in numerous interviews that ballades are not her strong point).~ The performances here are not up to the standards of her earlier recorded performances (see for example the DVDsJazz Icons: Anita O'Day Live in '63 & '70,Live in Tokyo '63, her historic performance inJazz on a Summer's Day, and the second DVD in the biographical setAnita O'Day - The Life Of A Jazz Singer).  Of course, some of this is the result of a long hard life, but some of it is the the lack of dynamic interaction between Anita and the individual members of the band.  If you want to see Anita the musician as an integral part of a band check out the videos listed and linked above.~ Despite the fact that Anita may have lost some of her spark, and the voice no longer had the clarity that it had in the 1950's and 1960's, Anita at 67 years of age was still a great improvisor.~ The sound quality is not as clear as it should be for a 1986 recording, and sometimes the balance between instrument volumes is not great; however, the video is visually excellent.~ I gave the DVD a rating of 3-stars (which for me is ""average"") mainly because there are other videos that document Anita O'Day at her best and therefore warrant higher ratings.  Having said that, the DVD is still entertaining and the music is much better than so much of the other music being produced in 1986 (not to mention today).",3,Anita O'Day - Live in 1986,1330732800,"03 3, 2012",2012,1642,"['~', '55', 'minute', 'DVD', 'capture', 'nice', 'performance', 'Anita', ""O'Day"", 'age', '67', 'just', '=', 'nice', 'Not', 'program', 'varied', 'signs', 'old', 'spark', 'up-tempo', 'numbers', 'However', 'ballades', 'drag', 'little', 'bit', 'even', 'Anita', 'admitted', 'numerous', 'interviews', 'ballades', 'are', 'not', 'strong', 'point', 'performances', 'here', 'are', 'not', 'standards', 'earlier', 'recorded', 'performances', 'see', 'example', 'DVDsJazz', 'Icons', 'Anita', ""O'Day"", 'Live', ""'63"", ""'70"", 'Live', 'Tokyo', ""'63"", 'historic', 'performance', 'inJazz', 'Summer', 'Day', 'second', 'DVD', 'biographical', 'setAnita', ""O'Day"", 'Life', 'A', 'Jazz', 'Singer', 'course', 'result', 'long', 'hard', 'life', 'lack', 'dynamic', 'interaction', 'Anita', 'individual', 'members', 'band', 'want', 'see', 'Anita', 'musician', 'integral', 'part', 'band', 'check', 'videos', 'listed', 'linked', 'fact', 'Anita', 'may', 'have', 'lost', 'spark', 'voice', 'no', 'longer', 'had', 'clarity', 'had', '1950', '1960', 'Anita', '67', 'years', 'age', 'was', 'still', 'great', 'improvisor.~', 'sound', 'quality', 'not', 'as', 'clear', 'should', 'be', '1986', 'recording', 'sometimes', 'balance', 'instrument', 'volumes', 'not', 'great', 'however', 'video', 'visually', 'excellent.~', 'gave', 'DVD', 'rating', '3-stars', 'average', 'mainly', 'are', 'other', 'videos', 'document', 'Anita', ""O'Day"", 'best', 'therefore', 'warrant', 'higher', 'ratings', 'Having', 'said', 'DVD', 'still', 'entertaining', 'music', 'much', 'better', 'so', 'much', 'other', 'music', 'being', 'produced', '1986', 'not', 'mention', 'today']",Anita O'Day - Live at Ronnie Scott's

1021489,A2EXDP1BBSAFQ6,B000IOM0VK,Matthew Watters,"[9, 10]","All too often, performances by jazz greats released on DVD date from the artists' declining years, when their technique or control has begun to slip, making most of these programmes slightly depressing affairs. I am happy to say, that's not the case here. O'Day benefits from never having depended on the quality of her voice for her greatness, so age doesn't really diminish her. Her vocal instrument was always merely pleasant, never spectacular. What makes Anita O'Day one of the greatest jazz singers of all time--nay, one of the great jazz *musicians*--is that she has such an innate feeling for the music. In every performance, she is constantly playing with time, rhythm, melodic variation. She is truly that jazz artist for whom the cliche fits: she never sings the same song twice. Watching her outfox and outplay her sidemen in this show (and she is outplaying them, albeit with her voice) is a real kick, as she gleefully deconstructs familiar old standards, sometimes several times within one song. Even the lyrics become almost secondary. For Anita, it's about the musical feeling, the improvisation, the sheer joy of getting inside a tune and blowing it up.  Watch this show, and the years seem to drop away. Anita O'Day is truly ageless.",5,A real surprise....,1233446400,"02 1, 2009",2009,1252,"['too', 'often', 'performances', 'jazz', 'greats', 'released', 'DVD', 'date', 'artists', 'declining', 'years', 'when', 'technique', 'control', 'begun', 'slip', 'making', 'most', 'programmes', 'slightly', 'depressing', 'affairs', 'am', 'happy', 'say', 'not', 'case', 'here', ""O'Day"", 'benefits', 'never', 'having', 'depended', 'quality', 'voice', 'greatness', 'so', 'age', ""n't"", 'really', 'diminish', 'vocal', 'instrument', 'was', 'always', 'merely', 'pleasant', 'never', 'spectacular', 'What', 'Anita', ""O'Day"", 'one', 'greatest', 'jazz', 'singers', 'time', 'nay', 'one', 'great', 'jazz', '*musicians*', 'such', 'innate', 'feeling', 'music', 'performance', 'constantly', 'playing', 'time', 'rhythm', 'melodic', 'variation', 'truly', 'jazz', 'artist', 'whom', 'cliche', 'fits', 'never', 'sings', 'same', 'song', 'twice', 'Watching', 'outfox', 'outplay', 'sidemen', 'show', 'outplaying', 'voice', 'real', 'kick', 'gleefully', 'familiar', 'old', 'standards', 'sometimes', 'several', 'times', 'one', 'song', 'Even', 'lyrics', 'become', 'almost', 'secondary', 'Anita', 'musical', 'feeling', 'improvisation', 'sheer', 'joy', 'getting', 'tune', 'blowing', 'up', 'Watch', 'show', 'years', 'seem', 'drop', 'away', 'Anita', ""O'Day"", 'truly', 'ageless']",Anita O'Day - Live at Ronnie Scott's
1021490,A2NYK9KWFMJV4Y,B000IOM0VK,"Mike Tarrani ""Jazz Drummer""","[1, 1]","This March 4, 1986 concert stands out for a number of reasons. Anita at 67 is as much in control of the stage and musicians as she was 28 years prior at the 1958 Newport Jazz Festival. And she could still sing and swing!A big plus for me is this video provided some excellent shots of her long time drummer, John Poole, who is one of my idols and inspirations (and was also with Anita at the 58 Newport Jazz Festival.)The opening song - Wave - was a good warm-up because when the next song - You'd Be So Nice To Come Home To - got going she hit her stride and maintained it for the rest of the concert. In that song she and Tommy Whittle on tenor saxophone traded fours in an extended call and response lasting more bars than I bothered to count. At one point the other musicians stopped while Anita and Mr. Whittle continued, building tension, which was released in a remarkably timed rejoining by John Poole, Merrill Hover in piano and Lennie Bush on bass. The next song, Green Dolphin Street was clear evidence that the energy was going to stay the entire performance. Even the next song, the ballad I Can't Get Started did not break the pace.I thoroughly enjoy watching Anita in performance, and especially when those performances are years apart so one can compare and contrast them. I have every DVD of her that is available, including her short appearance onJazz on a Summer's Day, and none of her energy or talent had left her when this performance was [thankfully] captured on film. This, like every other video I have of her, is a treasure and contains a performance to be savored again and again.",5,Still dominating the stage and swinging at 67,1335657600,"04 29, 2012",2012,1607,"['March', '4', '1986', 'concert', 'out', 'number', 'reasons', 'Anita', '67', 'as', 'much', 'control', 'stage', 'musicians', 'was', '28', 'years', 'prior', '1958', 'Newport', 'Jazz', 'Festival', 'could', 'still', 'sing', 'swing', 'big', 'plus', 'video', 'provided', 'excellent', 'shots', 'long', 'time', 'drummer', 'John', 'Poole', 'who', 'one', 'idols', 'inspirations', 'was', 'also', 'Anita', '58', 'Newport', 'Jazz', 'Festival', 'opening', 'song', 'Wave', 'was', 'good', 'warm-up', 'when', 'next', 'song', ""'d"", 'Be', 'So', 'Nice', 'Come', 'Home', 'got', 'going', 'hit', 'stride', 'maintained', 'rest', 'concert', 'song', 'Tommy', 'Whittle', 'tenor', 'saxophone', 'traded', 'fours', 'extended', 'call', 'response', 'lasting', 'more', 'bars', 'bothered', 'count', 'one', 'point', 'other', 'musicians', 'stopped', 'Anita', 'Mr.', 'Whittle', 'continued', 'building', 'tension', 'was', 'released', 'remarkably', 'timed', 'rejoining', 'John', 'Poole', 'Merrill', 'Hover', 'piano', 'Lennie', 'Bush', 'bass', 'next', 'song', 'Green', 'Dolphin', 'Street', 'was', 'clear', 'evidence', 'energy', 'was', 'going', 'stay', 'entire', 'performance', 'Even', 'next', 'song', 'ballad', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Get', 'Started', 'did', 'not', 'break', 'pace.I', 'thoroughly', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'Anita', 'performance', 'especially', 'when', 'performances', 'are', 'years', 'apart', 'one', 'can', 'compare', 'contrast', 'have', 'DVD', 'available', 'including', 'short', 'appearance', 'onJazz', 'Summer', 'Day', 'none', 'energy', 'talent', 'had', 'left', 'when', 'performance', 'was', '[', 'thankfully', ']', 'captured', 'film', 'other', 'video', 'have', 'treasure', 'performance', 'be', 'savored', 'again', 'again']",Anita O'Day - Live at Ronnie Scott's
