One problem with documentaries, of course, is that by the time they get to DVD, they are already somewhat out of date. But it's useful nonetheless.Filmmaker Randy Olson was an evolutionary biologist before he got the camera virus. His mother is included in the film, and she's a real prize, helping to explain a lot about Randy's own personality. His mom was a model before she married Randy's dad. And she's still quite a freethinker and fun lady. I especially love her ending to the film.Randy interviews both sides of the debate, tracks down historical elements, and has a clear understanding of how visual effects can assist in a project like this. For example, a brick wall with a few gaps illustrates ""God of the gaps"" arguments by gradually filling in the bricks, giving the cross which represents religion less and less room, and finally blocking it out altogether. The scientist who is posed before a particularly magnificent large fossil explains that the problem is this either leads to a phobia about science (fear that the gaps will be filled in) or a crisis of faith. Students shouldn't have to face that from a public school curriculum.He also spent a good bit of time with the Kansas School Board members and the Dover, PA, school board members. And former members. Also with lawyers who worked on these landmark cases, scientists and pseudo-scientists who testified in them, authors of books on both sides of the issue, and so on.It may not be well organized, but it's really quite a lot of information and even more fun.Oh, yes; there is also a flock of animated dodos who do their best.",4,"An Entertaining Look at ""Intelligent Design""",1336867200,"05 13, 2012",2012,1718,"['fun', 'rather', 'disorganized', 'look', 'Evolution-Intelligent', 'Design', 'Circus', 'as', 'far', 'had', 'gotten', '2006', 'One', 'problem', 'documentaries', 'course', 'time', 'get', 'DVD', 'are', 'already', 'somewhat', 'date', 'useful', 'nonetheless.Filmmaker', 'Randy', 'Olson', 'was', 'evolutionary', 'biologist', 'got', 'camera', 'virus', 'mother', 'included', 'film', 'real', 'prize', 'helping', 'explain', 'lot', 'Randy', 'own', 'personality', 'mom', 'was', 'model', 'married', 'Randy', 'dad', 'still', 'quite', 'freethinker', 'fun', 'lady', 'especially', 'love', 'ending', 'film.Randy', 'interviews', 'sides', 'debate', 'down', 'historical', 'elements', 'clear', 'understanding', 'how', 'visual', 'effects', 'can', 'assist', 'project', 'example', 'brick', 'wall', 'few', 'gaps', 'God', 'gaps', 'arguments', 'gradually', 'filling', 'bricks', 'giving', 'cross', 'religion', 'less', 'less', 'room', 'finally', 'blocking', 'out', 'altogether', 'scientist', 'who', 'posed', 'particularly', 'magnificent', 'large', 'fossil', 'explains', 'problem', 'either', 'phobia', 'science', 'fear', 'gaps', 'will', 'be', 'filled', 'crisis', 'faith', 'Students', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'face', 'public', 'school', 'curriculum.He', 'also', 'spent', 'good', 'bit', 'time', 'Kansas', 'School', 'Board', 'members', 'Dover', 'PA', 'school', 'board', 'members', 'former', 'members', 'Also', 'lawyers', 'who', 'worked', 'landmark', 'cases', 'scientists', 'pseudo-scientists', 'who', 'testified', 'authors', 'books', 'sides', 'issue', 'so', 'on.It', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'well', 'organized', 'really', 'quite', 'lot', 'information', 'even', 'more', 'fun.Oh', 'yes', 'also', 'flock', 'animated', 'dodos', 'who', 'do', 'best']",Flock of Dodos: The Evolution-Intelligent Design Circus

I am also glad that I waited six years to watch it since the documentary is very insulting to watch from a Creationist standpoint, and even from an Intelligent Design one for that matter since the insults keep on coming for 90 minutes. Additionally, one does not even get a clear understanding of what the theory of Intelligent Design actually believes, despite Michael Behe's assertions to the contrary. As other reviews have noted, evolutionary theory is presented from an academic viewpoint while contrary views are portrayed by ""good old plain folk"" who the movie makes out to be pure idiots and over and over again. The writer and his colleagues in the movie also come across as elitist, which is to be expected as humanistic philosophy promotes this attitude. Watched this movie twice and the extras and in the end, this DVD is not worth the penny that I paid for it and quickly went in the trash.",1,Pure Garbage.

1069519,A1K9KNLTSJF7Q9,B000PATZKQ,Daiho,"[4, 7]","A marine biologist turned filmmaker goes to middle America to explore the issue of Intelligent Design and discovers, to no one's great surprise, a political and social agenda behind a manufactured controversy.  Along the way director Dr  Randy Olson has reasoned, calm and mostly rational discussions with people from both sides of the issue, allowing each to explain their ideas, but also to reveal their vulnerabilities.  The Intelligent Designers for the most part know less about science and more about theology, while the scientists seem a bit smug and unable to communicate with anyone without a graduate degree in science.Overall, this is an intelligently produced and entertaining presentation of the topic.  Three points, though, I wish had been addressed.  First, if irreducible complexity demands a creator, then Dr Olson should have been asking, who created the creator?  Secondly, why does this science/religion controversy pop up from time to time only in the USA?  The rest of the world seems to care not a whit.  Finally, why is this question of the origin of life and the universe of any importance at all?  It seems obvious that understanding the question means being able to observe and measure the system from outside the system.  But as we are (and always will be) a part of the system, this is the equivalent of your eye trying to see itself.  It won't happen.#",4,"Intelligently produced and entertaining, questions left unasked",1218758400,"08 15, 2008",2008,1383,"['marine', 'biologist', 'turned', 'filmmaker', 'middle', 'America', 'explore', 'issue', 'Intelligent', 'Design', 'discovers', 'one', 'great', 'surprise', 'political', 'social', 'agenda', 'manufactured', 'controversy', 'way', 'director', 'Dr', 'Randy', 'Olson', 'reasoned', 'calm', 'mostly', 'rational', 'discussions', 'people', 'sides', 'issue', 'allowing', 'explain', 'ideas', 'also', 'reveal', 'vulnerabilities', 'Intelligent', 'Designers', 'most', 'part', 'know', 'less', 'science', 'more', 'theology', 'scientists', 'seem', 'bit', 'smug', 'unable', 'communicate', 'anyone', 'graduate', 'degree', 'science.Overall', 'intelligently', 'produced', 'entertaining', 'presentation', 'topic', 'Three', 'points', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'addressed', 'First', 'irreducible', 'complexity', 'creator', 'then', 'Dr', 'Olson', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'asking', 'who', 'created', 'creator', 'Secondly', 'why', 'science/religion', 'controversy', 'pop', 'up', 'time', 'time', 'only', 'USA', 'rest', 'world', 'care', 'not', 'whit', 'Finally', 'why', 'question', 'origin', 'life', 'universe', 'importance', 'obvious', 'understanding', 'question', 'being', 'able', 'observe', 'measure', 'system', 'system', 'are', 'always', 'will', 'be', 'part', 'system', 'equivalent', 'eye', 'trying', 'see', 'wo', ""n't"", 'happen.']",Flock of Dodos: The Evolution-Intelligent Design Circus
1069520,A3E68QNSCABRVW,B000PATZKQ,"Gradient Vector Field ""subjectedtometal (dot)...","[4, 7]","I've always rather enjoyed watching documentaries.  They were playing this one on the premium channels and for some reason I could just never catch the whole thing.  Eventually I just got fed up and decided to buy it since it seemed worth owning at any rate.  I read a vast amount of different subjects and two of those subjects involve Theology and Science.  So when I started hearing about this ""Intelligent Design"" theory (and I will now delineate this as theory from a literary perspective here, meaning entry definition #7 from dictionary.com ""guess or conjecture""), I thought it seemed plausible and made sense.  As I started looking into it a lot more I found the theory had many flaws.  When I watched this it really helped to explain the points of view in a very easy to understand manner.  I must say that I did learn a decent amount about the ""Intelligent Design"" theory from this film, of course this won't be my sole location, and I will also read books on this to find out what exactly the minute points are.This is definitely a documentary for people who are tired of the Michael Moore philosophy of documentaries.  Randy Olson really doesn't barge in on people or make them feel uncomfortable.  I think, for that reason, this documentary will speak to more people and more sides of the argument.  Whereas a Michael Moore approach can come off as ""rude"" to some people.  As most people will undoubtedly notice that when you're being belligerent most people tend to either shut down or oppose you even more vehemently.  At least with Randy Olson's documentary it doesn't present an overbearing feel and gives the Intelligent Design believers their fair shake to explain what they believe.  I think Olson expertly hits the nail on the head with what the real problem is in this kind of a ""debate"".  (I put debate in quotes, because it's technically not.)I think there are a few reasons why this stems even further than what is touched here in the documentary.  From a scientific perspective evolution is a fact.  However, it's listed as a ""theory of evolution"", and I think a major reason why non-scientists say to themselves ""well it might not be true"" is because most people don't know what it really takes for something to even be logged in as a theory in a science book.  I think this is where science has essentially lost contact with humanity in some respects, and it's quite clear people can't be responsible to learn it on their own.  So now all these people who think they understand what ""theory"" means from a literary perspective and not a scientific perspective walk into School Boards across the country and want to change science... for after all, it is just a theory.  Not exactly, you need to go from a hypothesis to a theory.  To get to the level of something being a theory it needs to be peer reviewed, and most importantly duplicated by multiple people.  It's the ability to duplicate the research and come out with the SAME results that makes it a theory.  It's a theory because it CAN undergo refinement.  Like Charles Darwin's initial theory for survival of the fittest.  It's been over a hundred years since that was proposed and just about everything in the ""Origin of Species"" has undergone refinement and changed.  So to essentially say that this is where evolutionary thinking is, is basically saying that science is stuck in the 1800's, which it, most assuredly, is not.  It's the same principle as the ""laws"" in the fields of physics.  Does the general population really think that Newton's law of gravitation hasn't been refined?  If they do then they are not keeping up because when Einstein came along it needed refinement... and that was just over fifty years ago.  This is the problem, people have lost touch with the scientific community and I think that a greater deal of communication is in order.The part Olson really nailed was that for the most part scientists are really bad at communicating this to the general public.  Olson does take a very light hearted approach to all this, after all he is a scientist as well, so he really can't berate them too much.  Though for a scientist, I think he communicates quite well with the public and he's the kind of guy science needs to help educate the greater populace about what's going on.On the other side, he spoke to quite a few people on the intelligent design camp.  I think he gave them a fair enough shake in letting them throw their ideas out there.  He didn't badger them or tell them they were wrong, he merely asked questions on the subject.  It seemed almost unanimous that when it came time to question the theory of evolution they felt the side of the evolution was rude or belligerent.  This doesn't help communicate the idea properly.  I'll be the first to admit that I'm not the nicest guy in the world, but even I have enough wit to adjust my delivery if it's just not being heard.  Olson specifically covered the issue in the school board in Kansas (since it's his home area) and I was quite shocked that this was even considered.  I'm not one to say you can't believe what you want, but if you're going to start playing something off as scientific rigor that isn't, then, yes, I do have an issue with that.  If I decide to have kids, I don't want them to grow up in a world where it is acceptable to stop asking questions of the world around them and summarily decide that, ""oh, I don't get it.  God must be the answer.""  I don't think that would be acceptable on both sides, and I know that's not the point of their argument, but it could be an adverse affect if this policy is brought in to play.  And where does it really stop... when we finally end up in a world that is portrayed in ""Fahrenheit 451"" where people aren't allowed to question anything anymore?From what I can perceive another problem that has lasted for centuries is that for people to clamor about their beliefs and not let science be performed correctly.  One of the scientists in the poker game brought up the Catholic Church suppressing Galileo because it didn't support their way of thinking and Galileo was observing a Copernican model.  I think a lot of scientists know about these kinds of historical references, far more than the general public, and for their profession to be in jeopardy because of faith seems to be like they're reliving something that already happened in some senses.  So I can see why scientists would get quite annoyed when someone purporting a ""God in the gaps"" theory comes along and tells them they don't have their facts straight.  I'm really not surprised at the rude backlash against the intelligent design theory.  I think the people in the intelligent design camp should probably start trying to look at it from the perspective of the scientists to understand why they're being rude.  Scientists probably can't even believe this is being debated; I for one really can't either, but scientists also need to look at it from the perspective of non-scientists as well to really explain their points.  What shocks me even more is that at some point someone could make this a lesson in the classroom.I think this documentary really helps elevate people's awareness to the major problems with this issue, especially since it shouldn't be.  This should spark some peoples concern and generate good discussions, because that's exactly what this does.  Unfortunately for the Intelligent Design side, on this DVD it seems their arguments are really very weak.  He even spoke to their greatest spokesman; Dr. Behe (whose book I haven't read yet, but now am more prompted to read).  A lot of the people arguing on the side of intelligent design don't really understand the major intricacies of evolution and that was made very clear.  Olson even tore down one of the books they point to in order to reference the problems in evolution: ""Icons of Evolution.""  This book apparently takes the perspective that kids are still learning science the same way it was taught in the 1800's.  This just isn't accurate.  This is also coming from a guy who says that ""Darwinism is anti-Christian"" in his book ""The Politically Incorrect Guide to Darwinism and Intelligent Design.""  This is just a stupid statement, I'm sorry, but I have to call it that because that's what it is.However, I cannot berate the Intelligent Design group too harshly because in some cases they ask absolutely excellent questions of science.  Such as when they ask for a specific thing to be explained, like flagellum bacteria.  These points will simply send some scientist to go and figure it out, which is great for science and some scientist did go out and do that.  I do think science should be questioned and I think everyone benefits in the end when tough questions are asked.  However, to say science should stop researching and just say ""god's the reason this happened"" is a faulty argument.  It honestly seems to be implied that this is what people that support intelligent design would want.  Dr. Behe has already convinced himself that he's right, and he's convinced a lot of others as well, but that doesn't mean scientists should just give up.  Galileo gave up after being summarily threatened, I don't want to go back to a world like that... a world that is flat and happens to revolve around the sun that is.  These arguments have been going on since the Middle Ages; they seriously need to be put to rest.The 10 questions part of the DVD which is about another 80 minutes is an excellent addition.  I personally would have liked to watch the full two presentations on this because they were very intriguing.  Namely that one of the major arguments against Intelligent Design is that it's not actually science.  If it was science and peer reviewed then authors like Jonathan Wells would have the support of the scientific community, and that what Dr. Behe says is factually correct.  The 10 questions also prompted me to go and purchase books by Michael Ruse because he seemed to explain things in a very interesting and excellent way.  They also have some deleted scenes where Dr. Behe says he's not so concerned about what is taught in public schools because his kids don't go to public school, this is from the man who typically speaks at the school board hearings to convince the school to teach intelligent design.  Olson mentioned he could have made a big deal out of it, but decided not to.  There is also an excellent humorous skit debate with comedians poking fun at the circus this country has turned into over this subject.  I found it to be pretty smart and funny, other reviewers clearly haven't.All in all, this is a great product.  This sums up both sides excellently and really delves into what is and what is not well researched.  In the end Olson does take the side of evolution and states that he wasn't really convinced by the intelligent design arguments, because they didn't have that much weight behind them.  I, for one, was tired of hearing Dr. Behe's Mt Rushmore argument towards the end of the documentary because it is not a good argument and shouldn't even be used to argue against science.  For one it is documented that mankind built it, so to bring that into some estranged hypothetical scenario that God might have done something makes no sense.  Not to mention the rocks look like humans from OUR history.  If you really wanted to use an argument like that, use something like the face that was seen on Mars years ago because we have no record of humans building a structure that looks like that on another planet.  Either way it's a rather preposterous argument.  I highly recommend this DVD, it really makes you think about where the education system is heading and what we can possibly do about it.",5,Excellent Documentary Giving Both Sides their Fair

Smartly, these groups have done away with the Biblical timeline of events and pretty much accept geological history, as Randy Olson points out in this humorous look at the seemingly endless Creation v. Evolution debate.  Olson also shows that evolution scientists haven't done themselves any favors by being so smug, assembling a group of renown scientists around a poker table who thought the debate dead and buried, while he goes on the road to track down the various members of the Kansas state school board that voted to bring the creation theory back into the classroom.  In the end, he asks who would you rather play poker with, and one has to admit that the members of the Kansas school board do seem much more fun.While expressing his concerns, I think Olson sees that the debate has generated more interest in science and that it is not necessarily a bad idea to bring the debate back into the fore.  He would prefer to keep it out of the classroom, or at least the science classroom, as there is very little scientific creedence to intelligent design, and its proponents have promulgated a number of half-truths and downright lies in making its feeble case that the theory of evolution is unteneble.  Olson shows how intelligent design advocates like to claim that Haeckel's illustrated fetal charts are still being used in classrooms to teach evolution.  The dubious charts were phased out long ago, and try as he and one of the advocates might, they could find no reference to Haeckel's charts in any recent textbook.But, most amusing of all, was the attempt by intelligent design advocates to compare the geological making of mountains to that of Mount Rushmore, claiming that it is god's hand at work.",5,The debate never ends,1197244800,"12 10, 2007",2007,1887,"['seem', 'flock', 'dodos', 'religious', 'zealots', 'once', 'again', 'promoting', 'divine', 'design', 'rather', 'intelligent', 'design', 'creation', 'heavens', 'earth', 'Smartly', 'groups', 'have', 'done', 'away', 'Biblical', 'timeline', 'events', 'pretty', 'much', 'geological', 'history', 'Randy', 'Olson', 'out', 'humorous', 'look', 'seemingly', 'endless', 'Creation', 'v.', 'Evolution', 'debate', 'Olson', 'also', 'evolution', 'scientists', 'have', ""n't"", 'done', 'favors', 'being', 'so', 'smug', 'assembling', 'group', 'renown', 'scientists', 'poker', 'table', 'who', 'thought', 'debate', 'dead', 'buried', 'road', 'track', 'down', 'various', 'members', 'Kansas', 'state', 'school', 'board', 'voted', 'bring', 'creation', 'theory', 'back', 'classroom', 'end', 'who', 'would', 'rather', 'play', 'poker', 'one', 'admit', 'members', 'Kansas', 'school', 'board', 'do', 'seem', 'much', 'more', 'fun.While', 'expressing', 'concerns', 'think', 'Olson', 'debate', 'generated', 'more', 'interest', 'science', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'idea', 'bring', 'debate', 'back', 'fore', 'would', 'prefer', 'keep', 'classroom', 'least', 'science', 'classroom', 'very', 'little', 'scientific', 'creedence', 'intelligent', 'design', 'proponents', 'have', 'promulgated', 'number', 'half-truths', 'downright', 'lies', 'making', 'feeble', 'case', 'theory', 'evolution', 'unteneble', 'Olson', 'how', 'intelligent', 'design', 'claim', 'Haeckel', 'illustrated', 'fetal', 'charts', 'are', 'still', 'being', 'used', 'classrooms', 'teach', 'evolution', 'dubious', 'charts', 'were', 'phased', 'out', 'long', 'ago', 'try', 'one', 'advocates', 'might', 'could', 'find', 'reference', 'Haeckel', 'charts', 'recent', 'textbook.But', 'most', 'amusing', 'was', 'attempt', 'intelligent', 'design', 'compare', 'geological', 'making', 'mountains', 'Mount', 'Rushmore', 'claiming', 'god', 'hand', 'work']",Flock of Dodos: The Evolution-Intelligent Design Circus
1069522,A2OP1HD9RGX5OW,B000PATZKQ,"Jedidiah Palosaari ""Not My Real Name""","[48, 53]","This is a very insightful condemnation of Intelligent Design and the approach of evolutionists, with minimal humor, but a lot of fun.  Olson takes a relaxed approach to this huge controversy, and teaches us a great deal in the process.He tells the story with some of the style of Michael Moore, using dry wit, multiple interviews, and an overt agenda. He was an evolutionary marine biologist, a student of the great Stephen Jay Gould, who decided to go into film, and here looks at all angles of the intelligent design controversy and how it tries to attack evolution. The movie is short on content and long on entertainment, and that's for a purpose. The goal of the movie is to show how behind biologists are in public relations, and how much more they need to do.The movie did this admirably. The evolutionists come across as either Ivory Tower scientists who can't relate to the public, or real prigs who you wouldn't want to drink with. The Intelligent Design folks are all pretty likable, but simultaneously really off when it comes to science, for the most part not knowing anything behind what they are saying. Olson wishes to point out this huge gulf between the facts and likability, and call scientists to a place where they can start to actually reach out to the public on a level that doesn't require four years of grad school to understand. The scientists are therefore the dodos in the film.This movie's raised a lot of controversy because the Discovery Institute, based in Seattle and the leader of the ID movement, complained that they weren't consulted and that the movie is very biased against them, for instance making it look like their budget is 5 million instead of 4 million. Likewise the scientific community complained that the movie makes them look bad and that Olson is calling for them to dumb down their material.  Yet Olson tried to use material indicative of the personalities, even excluding the comment that Behe made that he didn't care what was taught in public schools because his children don't attend them.  This comment wasn't reflective of all of the rest of Behe's interview, and so therefore was excluded from the film.  (It can be viewed, however, as an extra on this DVD.)There are moments to smile at here, rather than laugh out loud.  Some of the focus on the director's mom, Moose, was perhaps a bit irrelevant.  But the film overall is a brilliant work, simultaneously condemning both sides, and calling for radical change in the way that science is presented- but in a light-hearted manner that few can effectively achieve on film.",4,Irreverent Provocative Fun,1178841600,"05 11, 2007",2007,2581,"['very', 'insightful', 'condemnation', 'Intelligent', 'Design', 'approach', 'evolutionists', 'minimal', 'humor', 'lot', 'fun', 'Olson', 'relaxed', 'approach', 'huge', 'controversy', 'great', 'deal', 'process.He', 'story', 'style', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'using', 'dry', 'wit', 'multiple', 'interviews', 'overt', 'agenda', 'was', 'evolutionary', 'marine', 'biologist', 'student', 'great', 'Stephen', 'Jay', 'Gould', 'who', 'decided', 'go', 'film', 'here', 'angles', 'intelligent', 'design', 'controversy', 'how', 'attack', 'evolution', 'movie', 'short', 'content', 'long', 'entertainment', 'purpose', 'goal', 'movie', 'show', 'how', 'behind', 'biologists', 'are', 'public', 'relations', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'need', 'do.The', 'movie', 'did', 'admirably', 'evolutionists', 'come', 'Ivory', 'Tower', 'scientists', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'relate', 'public', 'real', 'prigs', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'drink', 'Intelligent', 'Design', 'folks', 'are', 'pretty', 'likable', 'simultaneously', 'really', 'off', 'when', 'science', 'most', 'part', 'not', 'knowing', 'anything', 'what', 'are', 'saying', 'Olson', 'point', 'out', 'huge', 'gulf', 'facts', 'likability', 'call', 'scientists', 'place', 'where', 'can', 'start', 'actually', 'reach', 'public', 'level', ""n't"", 'require', 'four', 'years', 'grad', 'school', 'understand', 'scientists', 'are', 'therefore', 'dodos', 'film.This', 'movie', 'raised', 'lot', 'controversy', 'Discovery', 'Institute', 'based', 'Seattle', 'leader', 'ID', 'movement', 'complained', 'were', ""n't"", 'consulted', 'movie', 'very', 'biased', 'instance', 'making', 'look', 'budget', '5', 'million', 'instead', '4', 'million', 'Likewise', 'scientific', 'community', 'complained', 'movie', 'look', 'bad', 'Olson', 'calling', 'dumb', 'down', 'material', 'Olson', 'tried', 'use', 'material', 'indicative', 'personalities', 'even', 'excluding', 'comment', 'Behe', 'made', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'was', 'taught', 'public', 'schools', 'children', 'do', ""n't"", 'attend', 'comment', 'was', ""n't"", 'reflective', 'rest', 'Behe', 'interview', 'so', 'therefore', 'was', 'excluded', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'however', 'extra', 'DVD', 'are', 'moments', 'smile', 'here', 'rather', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'focus', 'director', 'mom', 'Moose', 'was', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'irrelevant', 'film', 'overall', 'brilliant', 'work', 'simultaneously', 'condemning', 'sides', 'calling', 'radical', 'change', 'way', 'science', 'presented-', 'light-hearted', 'manner', 'few', 'can', 'effectively', 'achieve', 'film']",Flock of Dodos: The Evolution-Intelligent Design Circus
1069523,A3ODGAW5Z2EJ1M,B000PATZKQ,Kevin Currie-Knight,"[7, 9]","""We have woefully under-educated the American public in the area of science. It is going to take a long time to overcome that.""- Kansas School Board member as  quoted in ""Flock of Dodos""I am not sure if it is possible to write a ""spoiler"" to a documentary film. But if it is, I warn you that I am about to do it, as the conclusion of Flock of Dodos is quite necessary to reviewing this film. If you don't want me to spoil it for you, don't read on.The film ""Flock of Dodo's"" is one scientist's (now film-maker's) journey to explore what the big deal is behind the intelligent design/evolution controversey. The conclusion? It is a controversey not of sceintists versus sceintists, but scientists versus lawyers and advertisers. The director tells us that his purpose was to find out more about the controversey in order to see if there was anything to it, but the more he found out, the more problems he had.This is a very cool film that takes something of the form of a road-trip primarily into, and back out of, Kansas (where one of the more famous challenges to evolution in school curricula took place). We meet quite a few faces from all sides. On the evolution side, we meet several scientists from various universities and two former school board members. On the ID side, we meet Michael Behe (one of ID's 'pioneers'), John Calvert (lawyer making his living defending ID), and even attempt, unsuccessfully, to meet some folk from the Discovery Institute.Through all of this, however, the film's director notices a big problem. Even though evolution is quite universally accepted and regarded as well corroborated fact in the scientific community, scientists and academics are very bad at being spokespersons for evolution in the way people like John Calvery and Michael Behe are spokespersons for ID. At one point, the director even wonders to himself, after noting Behe's status as one of the 'faces' of ID, who Behe's equivalent is in the evolution world: who are the public spokespersons? The answer, he finds, is that there aren't really any. (He does not mention people like Richard Dawkins, but if he did, it would be sad, as Dawkins has more-and-more become a perfect target for accusations of evolutionary zeolotry and irreligion).Another great thing about this film is that we meet a wide variety of people and begin to see all of them as quite human - none of these people are evil, though many of them are convinced that the other side is. (And if both sides are nice folk convinced that the other side is evil, then the question comes up: do they really know eachother at all, or do they just scream in eachother's direction?)My personal favorite by way of highlights was the director's confrontation of John Calvert, who asserts that Haeckel's drawings are a fraud widely used in evolution textbooks. Were Haeckel's drawings a fraid? Yes, and you don't have to get this info from - as Calvert did - Jonathan Wells' inflamatory book ""Icons of Evolution."" Are these drawings widely reproduced in textbooks? The answer is no, and the confrontation leading us to this conclusion is absolutely hilarious. I won't spoil it; you have to see it for yourself!This is a good film. At times, it seems almost Michael Moore-ish but, unlike Moore's films, there really isn't a whole lot of UNSUBSTANTIATED spin here. You don't get the impression, as one does with Moore's films, that he is ambushing people, or that he is using rhetorical trickery (like taking quotes out of context, or grandstanding.) Behe has as much, if not more, say than many of the scientists in the film.If you are concerned about evolution, intelligent design, and the fuure of sceince education, this is an outsanding film to watch. The director shows us why the issue is as contentious as it is important, and why - more importantly - evolutionists may be winning in the halls of the academe but losing in the sidwalks of Everytown, USA. He reminds us that if evolution hopes to win the day, it must roll up its sleeves and accept the fact that public relations is what we must do.Entertaining. Interesting.

It is both educational and interesting.  This film touches aspects of the debate that you may not have seen in the media.What is the difference between evolution and intelligent design?  What is the difference between intelligent design and creationism?  If you don't know or not sure, then this is the one you need to watch.It's interesting to see how much and how long these people have been fighting for what is to be taught in the schools, especially the Kansas Board of Education.  It is amazing to see what people believe about the origin of life.One camp believes in ""teaching the science"".  The other camp believes in ""teaching the controversy"".  So, one believes that presenting natural evidences (fossils, etc.) is the way to go in schools.  The other believes that one should lay out pros and cons of each theories/approaches.  The bigger question that this film presents is what exactly is intelligent design?  And how is this really different from evolution or even from creationism?This film touches on the state boards of education in a few cities, the Discovery Institute, scientists/evolutionists and their views, Christians, and other whatnots.  For a film that is 1 and a half hour long, it is packed with information.  You just have to watch it.Now, Olson did a good job on the subject of intelligent design.  There's just some parts of it that could have been edited out.  I think that Olson tries to be like Michael Moore.  The difference is that Moore has more balls to confront people.

1069526,A2UU6VWL6H18A1,B000PATZKQ,Lucius,"[5, 8]","Former marine biologist Randy Olson has crafted a brilliant and very down-home style documetary that exposes the soft underbelly of the  ID ""controversy"" which, as it turns out, is little more than the proverbial tempest-in-a-teapot.  There are, however, a number of disturbing issues raised by easy going, good ol' boy Dr. Olson.  First, the duplicitous shenanigans of the ID crowd as personified by Professor of Communications John Angus Campbell who speaks on behalf of Darwin but is a long time board member of Discovery Institute (and who also gave the interviewer that wierd pinkie/index finger ""hook 'em horns"" hand gesture which makes me wonder about his allegiances altogether).  Then there is the well known Dr. Michael Behe whose scholarship in science serves a religious doctrine that is oddly reminiscent of Inquistion priests who extracted confessions from those who saw the gaps in the god.  Today Behe and others exploit the nonsensical ""god in the gaps.""  Just a through the looking glass reflection of the same wrong-headed adherence to dogmatic belief.Second, and even more problematic, is the quotation by Justice Scalia from his dissenting Minority Report on the Edwards v The State of Lousiania case(1987).  ""The people of Lousiana...are quite entitled...to have whatever evidence there may be against evolution presented in their schools...""  One must wonder if this same principle applies to every  theory.  Ought every scientific theory presented in a public school science class include ""whatever evidence"" there may be ""against"" the prevailing scientific paradigm? This would certainly open the doors to whatever ""evidence"" diverges from science such as UFOs, Bigfoot, and a host of paranormal phenomenon.  One can only imagine the intolerable bind that such a principle of inclusion would put science educators in.Dr. Olson's non confrontational interview style allows believers to be hoisted by their own petards.  But he doesn't spare scientists either.  Their rarified discourses can't compete with the ID PR machine that reduces science to sound-bites and false analogies crafted to snare the unwary. Frutstrated though they may be, mainstream academic scientists take a hands off approach to ID as being hopelessly irrelevant and simply cannot reduce the complexities of science to layman's terms.  As a consequence bumperstickers proclaiming ""teach the controversy"" hold more sway than the writings of the late Stephen J. Gould.Dr. Olson has done a great service in documenting the history and current state of affairs of religiously inspired attempts to put god back in the schools and return us to the Dark Ages.  It was certainly not a good sign that Christian fundamentalists appear to sound much like Muslim fundmentalists in their rejection of secular science.  Come to think of it, that's exactly what it sounds like.",5,Terrific,1210464000,"05 11, 2008",2008,2858,"['Former', 'biologist', 'Randy', 'Olson', 'crafted', 'brilliant', 'very', 'down-home', 'style', 'documetary', 'soft', 'underbelly', 'ID', 'controversy', 'out', 'little', 'more', 'proverbial', 'tempest-in-a-teapot', 'are', 'however', 'number', 'disturbing', 'issues', 'raised', 'easy', 'going', 'good', 'ol', 'boy', 'Dr.', 'Olson', 'First', 'duplicitous', 'shenanigans', 'ID', 'crowd', 'personified', 'Professor', 'Communications', 'John', 'Angus', 'Campbell', 'who', 'behalf', 'Darwin', 'long', 'time', 'board', 'member', 'Discovery', 'Institute', 'who', 'also', 'gave', 'interviewer', 'pinkie/index', 'finger', 'hook', 'hand', 'gesture', 'wonder', 'allegiances', 'altogether', 'Then', 'well', 'known', 'Dr.', 'Michael', 'Behe', 'scholarship', 'science', 'serves', 'religious', 'doctrine', 'oddly', 'reminiscent', 'Inquistion', 'priests', 'who', 'extracted', 'confessions', 'who', 'saw', 'gaps', 'god', 'Today', 'Behe', 'others', 'exploit', 'nonsensical', 'god', 'gaps', 'looking', 'glass', 'reflection', 'same', 'wrong-headed', 'adherence', 'dogmatic', 'belief.Second', 'even', 'more', 'problematic', 'quotation', 'Justice', 'Scalia', 'dissenting', 'Minority', 'Report', 'Edwards', 'v', 'State', 'Lousiania', 'case', '1987', 'people', 'Lousiana', 'are', 'quite', 'entitled', 'have', 'evidence', 'may', 'be', 'evolution', 'presented', 'schools', 'One', 'must', 'wonder', 'same', 'principle', 'applies', 'theory', 'Ought', 'scientific', 'theory', 'presented', 'public', 'school', 'science', 'class', 'include', 'evidence', 'may', 'be', 'prevailing', 'scientific', 'paradigm', 'would', 'certainly', 'open', 'doors', 'whatever', 'evidence', 'diverges', 'science', 'such', 'UFOs', 'Bigfoot', 'host', 'paranormal', 'phenomenon', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'intolerable', 'bind', 'principle', 'inclusion', 'would', 'put', 'science', 'educators', 'in.Dr', 'Olson', 'non', 'confrontational', 'interview', 'style', 'believers', 'be', 'hoisted', 'own', 'petards', ""n't"", 'spare', 'scientists', 'either', 'rarified', 'discourses', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compete', 'ID', 'PR', 'machine', 'science', 'sound-bites', 'false', 'analogies', 'crafted', 'snare', 'unwary', 'Frutstrated', 'may', 'be', 'mainstream', 'academic', 'scientists', 'take', 'hands', 'off', 'approach', 'ID', 'being', 'hopelessly', 'irrelevant', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'reduce', 'complexities', 'science', 'layman', 'terms', 'consequence', 'bumperstickers', 'proclaiming', 'teach', 'controversy', 'hold', 'more', 'sway', 'writings', 'late', 'Stephen', 'J.', 'Gould.Dr', 'Olson', 'done', 'great', 'service', 'documenting', 'history', 'current', 'state', 'affairs', 'religiously', 'inspired', 'attempts', 'put', 'god', 'back', 'schools', 'return', 'Dark', 'Ages', 'was', 'certainly', 'not', 'good', 'sign', 'Christian', 'fundamentalists', 'appear', 'sound', 'much', 'Muslim', 'fundmentalists', 'rejection', 'secular', 'science', 'Come', 'think', 'exactly', 'what']",Flock of Dodos: The Evolution-Intelligent Design Circus

The concept of contrasting the haughty presentation style of some academics with the simple logic ""good plain folks"" supporting creationism looked like a winner. The premise is right on. Evolution science needs a more effective and friendly public media presence.Sadly, the production values and exposition of this film were a somewhat of a disappointment. Flock of Dodos looks like a low-budget production with grabshot camera work, cheesy graphics and title design. This would be more acceptable if the documenatry focused more on the task of showing how part of the ID movement is a well-funded PR machines and how this subversive power is used to influence the ""nice creationist believers"" that are shown. Flock of Dodos gets caught up in the carnival atmosphere of the controversial subject and delivers a cinematic theme park of disconnected interviews, graphics, historical images, and personal family history.  For my taste, the filmmakers mother, Muffy Moose, while quite a character, was also a distraction.I kept waiting for this film to settle down and deliver an intellectual or emotional punch... it never happened.Flock of Dodos needed more of a focused, edgy style of comedy. I imagined a well crafted monologue instead of a steady string of one liners - more like George Carlin or Lewis Black and less like Larry the Cable Guy.The DVD features a bonus section that includes some additional commentary and outakes, including a pathetic debate skit that was fortunately scrapped in post production, but also some asides that, to me, were far more interesting than the film itself - particularly ID guru Dr. Michael Behe's candor regarding his indifference to public education. I would have preferred it if the film-makers would have incorporated two or three of these comments into the conclusion.Flock of Dodos is worth seeing once, but it's not a film with the impact or staying power that one might have hoped for.",3,Just OK...
